1
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,720
Hello, hello!

2
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,320
I'm sorry I started late today... again.

3
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,440
I'm sorry.

4
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,100
I thought today would be the day I'm going to stream Marvel Rebels early.

5
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,660
And then I got eepy.

6
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,340
It was my bad.

7
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,260
I got tired.

8
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,760
So I took a nap.

9
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,380
And I made an alarm.

10
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,680
I was like, Alright, Doki, you're gonna wake up after an hour nap.

11
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,960
I was working all day in the morning.

12
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,560
When I woke up in the morning, I was doing work stuff.

13
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,360
Catching up to two months old messages and emails every day.

14
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,520
Ever since the new year, I've been slowly catching up on my backlog of messages and emails.

15
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,340
I can't do it all at once.

16
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,740
I have to slowly catch up to things.

17
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,500
So I don't get burnt out.

18
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,420
I'm slowly returning back to being a normal human being.

19
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
So I was doing that this morning.

20
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,320
And then all the way to 4 or 5 p.m.

21
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,180
And I was just like, I'm eepy.

22
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,160
Oh my gosh.

23
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,980
One hour.

24
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,500
One hour nap.

25
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,000
It'll be fine.

26
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,300
One hour nap.

27
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,260
It'll be okay.

28
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,580
I slept through that alarm.

29
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,420
And I woke up at like 10 p.m.

30
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
And I was like, oh.

31
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,820
I was like, oh, that's not good.

32
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,840
And then the thing is, all right, so today I have adopted a new tank player.

33
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,980
We are going to be playing with Boger.

34
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,080
He is an European tank player.

35
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,380
He's known around in the scene.

36
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,220
And the thing is, I made an appointment with Boger yesterday.

37
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,400
Because I was like, all right, today I'm going to grind.

38
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,960
Do you want to play?

39
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,340
And then he was like, yeah, but I start stream at 10 p.m.

40
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,180
Is that okay?

41
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,540
And I was like, well, I do early.

42
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,300
I want to stream early today.

43
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,760
I want to stream an N8 hour.

44
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,700
So I'm going to be streaming at like 5 to 6, but you can hop on whenever.

45
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,380
And then he like messaged me at 10.

46
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,320
It was like, hey, are you ready?

47
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,080
Hey, hey.

48
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,000
And I'm like, I took a nap.

49
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,980
I was just like, oh, yeah, I took a nap.

50
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,200
So here we are at 10.30.

51
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,900
Hey, that's an hour early.

52
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,100
That's like 30 minutes earlier than my usual Marvel Rivals streams.

53
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,280
So like, that's an improvement, sort of.

54
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,220
That's sort of an improvement.

55
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,040
Also, give me a sec.

56
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,660
I just got a reply to this work email real quick, because I just got the translation.

57
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,300
And like, I know, knowing me, I'm going to be playing this for a while.

58
00:06:51,660 --> 00:07:00,680
So let me just reply this real quick, because I know it's going to take me a while.

59
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,180
Anyway, here we are again.

60
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,940
Here we go again to more Marvel Rivals today.

61
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:18,060
I uploaded a new video about my first Marvel Rivals marathon grind.

62
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,980
So you do exclamation point, new video, you'll be linked to the new video.

63
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,740
To the new... Is that the command?

64
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,960
Oh, sorry, new vid.

65
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,940
Sorry, it's new vid, not new video.

66
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,160
Did I write the wrong command on my title?

67
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,320
I don't know.

68
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,420
I'm a little bit of a mess.

69
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,180
No, I did.

70
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,940
This is the right command.

71
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,140
New vid, yes.

72
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,740
Thank you for gifting a sub to Tempo.

73
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Thank you, thank you.

74
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,040
I really appreciate it.

75
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,000
Thank you so much.

76
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,060
I swear to God, I will return back to normal in five days.

77
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,280
It could be sooner.

78
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:05,080
If Booger greased us with the rank roints luck, we could get 150 points today.

79
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,140
How hard could it be?

80
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,520
How hard could it be to win five games in a row?

81
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,380
Surely, it can't be that hard.

82
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,420
Shut up.

83
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,860
Surely.

84
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,440
Also, you know what I noticed?

85
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,820
I noticed that I haven't bumped into any fucking streamers.

86
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,140
Yet, everybody and their fucking mom is playing and streaming this.

87
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,520
Yet, for somehow...

88
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:50,720
I mean, earlier I've been bumping into them, but during my late night marathon sessions, like the last week, I feel like I haven't bumped into anybody.

89
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,380
Yet, everybody's streaming it.

90
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
Like, I bump into Mac one time.

91
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,580
Everyone is... I was talking to one of my friends.

92
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,680
I was like, I don't understand.

93
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,520
Like, they're all streaming it.

94
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,000
Like, I don't... Or I would just be on the enemy team.

95
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,000
Yet, but that was not... Yet, but bumping into xQc was not a week ago.

96
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,900
Like, I meant the last week of me streaming.

97
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,060
Of me streaming and, like, actually using voice comms.

98
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,980
I'm just so... Maybe they're all just in East Coast.

99
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,000
We have to reintegrate East Coast back in because Booger is European.

100
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,140
So, like, East Coast servers will have the best ping for him.

101
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,220
So, like, I have to reintegrate East Coast, sadly.

102
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,880
I have to acknowledge the Easties for today's session.

103
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,120
Oh my god.

104
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,560
Also, like, I had the fucking... I don't know why, but my dreams went out the window.

105
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,700
I dreamt about Rick and Morty, but, like, I was Rick and Morty.

106
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,780
I don't know.

107
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,920
I think I'm far too gone.

108
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,100
This grind has, like, fucked me up mentally.

109
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,080
I don't... I don't know why.

110
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,200
Like, I dreamt that I was Rick and Morty.

111
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,900
And we were playing out the fucking weirdest scenario of a Rick and Morty episode.

112
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,320
And, um, I need... I need to be freed.

113
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,960
Today, I... There is a chance that today will be the day that we'll all be freed.

114
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,860
We just need 5 games.

115
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,440
We just... We literally... We literally just need 5 games.

116
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,460
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... Yeah, 5 games.

117
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,500
5 or 6 games.

118
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,760
Just... 6 games of wins.

119
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,060
It can't be that hard.

120
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,480
Just 6 games of wins.

121
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:54,480
We either get 6... We either get the cutoff for top 500 or... Or we try and get Eternity back.

122
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,860
There's no in-between.

123
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,880
There's no in-between.

124
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,180
168.

125
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,880
It's 170 points now?

126
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,420
How... Okay.

127
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,560
How... It's, like, climbing, like, 10 points per day.

128
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,860
That's... Oh, my God.

129
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,880
I hate Endless Season.

130
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,200
Okay, maybe not 200 points.

131
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,900
Maybe it's gonna be 250.

132
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,680
I feel like... Oh, my God.

133
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,880
It could actually be 250.

134
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,920
I think it might be 250.

135
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,620
Like, I... There's no way.

136
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,560
We have... How many days left do we have?

137
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,640
We have... Oh, my God.

138
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,700
How do I check this again?

139
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,840
We have 4 days... Technically, 5 days.

140
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,320
Oh, my God.

141
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,120
It could be 250.

142
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,200
Maybe 250 is safer.

143
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,180
250 or 260.

144
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:44,840
Okay.

145
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,100
Maybe we'll try and get 200.

146
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,280
We'll try... We'll aim for 200.

147
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,500
I don't think we gotta aim high.

148
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:50,960
I can't.

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,500
I don't know.

150
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,640
250 seems a little bit too much.

151
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,580
Too many wins.

152
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,180
Maybe we're gonna aim for 200 or we get Eternity back.

153
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,120
Like...

154
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,940
Because I can't go either way.

155
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,640
250 or we get Eternity.

156
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,360
We get... We get back Eternity.

157
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,260
So... Oh, my God.

158
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,180
Mel, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

159
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,520
Thank you.

160
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,180
Thank you.

161
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,840
Rodek, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

162
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,140
Thank you.

163
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,640
Thank you.

164
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,700
I really appreciate it.

165
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,620
Thank you so much.

166
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,700
I wonder if he's ready yet.

167
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,300
I don't know.

168
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,700
Let me see if he's on here.

169
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,560
No, I don't think so.

170
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,800
Okay, I'm gonna do a quick play game to warm up.

171
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,680
I'm gonna play Psylocke.

172
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,700
I would say... It's gonna... Guys...

173
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,220
We will have a... Maybe I'll be Loki again.

174
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,700
I'm gonna copy Psylocke.

175
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,460
No Conquest.

176
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,680
No... Fuck that game mode.

177
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,940
NotSoDeadPool, thank you for the... Thank you for the 100 bitties.

178
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,300
Thank you.

179
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,940
Thank you.

180
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,480
Here you go.

181
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,400
Just for you.

182
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,460
Just... Oh, my God.

183
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,280
Just... Sorry.

184
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,880
Just for you.

185
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,800
I got you, bro.

186
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,700
Don't worry.

187
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,600
I got you.

188
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,500
Okay.

189
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,460
I don't think we're gonna be the top streamer of Marvel Rivals today.

190
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,380
There's a lot of big hitters streaming today.

191
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,680
Literally, Stride is on.

192
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:17,680
There's a lot of... I swear to fucking... Oh, my God.

193
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,320
Why is everybody into pink Psylocke?

194
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,920
Combat, thank you for the five gifted souls.

195
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,320
Thank you.

196
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,000
Thank you.

197
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,300
I really appreciate it.

198
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,080
A lot of the big hitters are on today.

199
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,520
So, like, they all want their rank roids.

200
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,000
MechaKitten, thank you for the 1,000 bitties.

201
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,080
Thank you.

202
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,620
I really appreciate it.

203
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,880
That's right.

204
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,300
Heal.

205
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,280
Heal, kittens.

206
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,300
I have to heal.

207
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,400
I have to be support in the next two, three plus hours.

208
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,480
It's your turn to heal.

209
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,060
Alright, I want to win this game fast, so I'm gonna play Hella.

210
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,620
I either get shit on by the enemy team or at fucking Papa.

211
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,240
We'll see.

212
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
We'll see what the...

213
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,920
I honestly don't even think, like, the higher rank players play quick play, honestly.

214
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:17,500
A lot of them tend to not play pubs because why play pubs when you can play rank?

215
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,760
So, like, it's... Oh, my God.

216
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,840
Maybe we'll be lucky.

217
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,140
Maybe we'll be lucky that it's just shitters on and quick play.

218
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,220
Alright, here we go.

219
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,120
Let's see if we can do it.

220
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,460
Alright.

221
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,060
I'm also, like... Oh, my God.

222
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,520
Oh, my God.

223
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:42,780
Okay.

224
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,760
Okay.

225
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,420
It's fine.

226
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,600
Oh, wait.

227
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,460
It's not fine.

228
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,720
Oh, he's not... I'm not tank, so he's not gonna kidnap me.

229
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,180
Behind me?

230
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,060
Who's behind me?

231
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,780
Okay.

232
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,060
Did you guys all die from one guy?

233
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,580
Okay, guys.

234
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,620
Oh, please.

235
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,160
Why did you banish him?

236
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,880
There we go.

237
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,340
Where is he?

238
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,600
Where are you?

239
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,320
Get over here.

240
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,660
Let me send you some fucking arrows.

241
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,620
God, this Iron Man is dumb as fuck.

242
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,340
Like, you don't just stand in the open.

243
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,060
You're so fucking stupid.

244
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,300
Oh, my God.

245
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,340
Please, let me do something.

246
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,980
Push up.

247
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,920
Why are you hiding?

248
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,140
Oh, my God.

249
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,060
Where's my supports?

250
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,200
I swear to God.

251
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,300
Iron Man, swap off.

252
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,020
It's embarrassing.

253
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,420
Swap off.

254
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,060
Oh, fuck.

255
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,940
Oh, fuck.

256
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,660
Okay, it's fine.

257
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,260
It's fine.

258
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,420
Doki is quick.

259
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,440
It doesn't matter.

260
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,060
Gaming is gaming.

261
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,880
I might need to, like...

262
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,160
Oh, my gosh.

263
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,940
Okay, give me a sec.

264
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,120
I'm actually, like... I might need to grab some gamer stuff.

265
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,220
I...

266
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,540
Oh, my God.

267
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,280
I feel so lagarthic right now.

268
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,060
Oh, my God.

269
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,700
My aim.

270
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,300
I can't.

271
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,580
I'm done fucking too...

272
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,920
I just woke up, man.

273
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,920
I can't.

274
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,420
My aim is not ready for, like, wake...

275
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,080
Bro, why are you doing that tech and fucking quick play?

276
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,360
Holy shit.

277
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,180
Oh, my God.

278
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,040
The fact that you're doing this tech and quick play and it's not even a good tech.

279
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,360
Like, a lot of people don't know that tech is...

280
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,560
That tech is, like, bugged out.

281
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Kill me, please.

282
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,040
Oh, no.

283
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,620
Oh, no.

284
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,100
He has his fucking buff.

285
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,220
No, it's okay.

286
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,780
I got the gamer subs ready.

287
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,140
Don't worry.

288
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,800
Alright.

289
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,080
Don't worry.

290
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,900
We'll be fine.

291
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,820
Thank you.

292
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:20,000
I think, like, I've, like, pavloved myself into drinking gamer subs every... before a rank session.

293
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,520
Because of how many times I have to play rank at these hours.

294
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,640
And, like, it's not even intentional.

295
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,020
I just... It's either I don't find players until, like, 11 p.m.

296
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,940
Or, like... Or, like, I just got E.P.

297
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,560
I just get E.P.

298
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,580
It's not even intentional.

299
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,180
I literally only drink gamer subs from Marvel Rivals at this point.

300
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,540
Oh, my God.

301
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,700
Okay, here we go.

302
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,000
I actually have, like, a gamer sub jar.

303
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,220
Just in case I need the powder.

304
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,360
It's, like... Oh, my game...

305
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,480
Did you guys know, like...

306
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,540
People are, like, modifying game files to have more frames.

307
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,740
Where, like, it removes shadows and stuff.

308
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,900
And then the devs made a statement and said, like, Yeah, we don't like that.

309
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,840
So... So it might become a bad-able offense.

310
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,100
That's why I was, like, I'm not modding my game.

311
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,480
Like, I don't trust...

312
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm, like, I don't trust them to be okay with it.

313
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,820
Like...

314
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,840
Yeah.

315
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,960
That's why I don't mod my game.

316
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,600
Because I literally... I don't trust them to be okay.

317
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,420
Like...

318
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,460
Oh, no.

319
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,060
He's gonna throw.

320
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,380
Oh, shit.

321
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,040
Goodbye.

322
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,160
Don't worry.

323
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,820
I'll be here.

324
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,280
I'll be here.

325
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,440
Goodbye.

326
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,360
Oh, my God.

327
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:52,780
He's one.

328
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,840
Where is the Iron Man?

329
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,960
Jesus Christ, that's sad.

330
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,100
Oh, he's so low.

331
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,140
He's so low!

332
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,480
Get over here, Black Panther!

333
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,640
Oh, he's dead.

334
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:05,940
Okay.

335
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,360
That's fine.

336
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:15,420
It's apparently... No, it's just because, like, devs normally don't like when you, like, modify game files to enhance performance.

337
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Like, they'd rather you do it, like, in the settings.

338
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,840
That's why I was, like, I ain't touching anything related to, like, mods.

339
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,400
Because even then, sometimes they think mods in general can be...

340
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,360
Because I don't trust Anti-Cheat.

341
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,420
I feel like Anti-Cheat's gonna think that, like, it's...

342
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,600
Especially, like, modding a multiplayer fucking game is so risky in general.

343
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,000
Because, um, I feel like they just think it's, like, a hack accidentally.

344
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,040
Because Anti-Cheat's stupid sometimes.

345
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,160
Alright.

346
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,080
I'm just gonna...

347
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,320
Oh, I'm backing out.

348
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,140
Bird!

349
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:49,940
Woo!

350
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,460
Alright, bird form!

351
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,560
Woo!

352
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,700
Alright, bird form!

353
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,500
Bird form!

354
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,120
How are they alive?

355
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,680
This is bullshit.

356
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,600
Like, how...

357
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,180
When they do hella ult, they get 20 kills.

358
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,420
When I do hella ult, it doesn't fucking matter.

359
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,640
Okay.

360
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,020
I feel like I get damage, but no kills.

361
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,280
Like...

362
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,060
That's fine.

363
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,660
I don't need to kill people.

364
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,240
I...

365
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,840
Alright, I made Luna ulted.

366
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,180
I did my job.

367
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,260
Where's Hulk?

368
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,260
Give me your ult charge.

369
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,220
Give me your ult charge.

370
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,860
Okay, that was dumb.

371
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,580
You could've waited.

372
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,200
That's...

373
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,040
There's still 20 seconds left of the Luna ult.

374
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,980
I'm not even gonna move my...

375
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,880
I'm not even gonna AD.

376
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,140
Fuck this.

377
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,680
I'm just...

378
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,840
I'm just gonna stand here.

379
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,300
Nobody's hurting me.

380
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,900
Nobody realized I exist anyway.

381
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,600
So, like, what's the point?

382
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,420
Oh, shit!

383
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,220
Okay.

384
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,340
Don't worry.

385
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,160
I'm helping.

386
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm help...

387
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,700
Oh!

388
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm fucking...

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,860
I'll start helping.

390
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,300
He came right there.

391
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,520
Don't worry.

392
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,840
I'm helping.

393
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm helping.

394
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,320
Oh, I'm...

395
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,120
I'm helpful.

396
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,320
There, see?

397
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:15,960
Oh.

398
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,440
He did his...

399
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,380
She did his fucking passive.

400
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,440
See?

401
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,240
I told you guys.

402
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,260
I'm so helpful.

403
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,520
See?

404
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,760
I got him out of mech form.

405
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,360
I did it, guys.

406
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,120
Look at that.

407
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,480
Where is he?

408
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,040
Oh, my God.

409
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,460
I hate Black Panther players.

410
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
Where the fuck is he?

411
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,580
Please.

412
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,540
Oh, my God.

413
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,920
I...

414
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,200
Fuck.

415
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,500
Fine.

416
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,780
Fuck this.

417
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,240
What is this?

418
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,440
What do you mean?

419
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,580
What do you mean?

420
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
What is this aim?

421
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,100
We won.

422
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,980
We fucking won.

423
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,060
We won.

425
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,200
Why are you...

426
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,920
What is this aim?

427
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,700
Oh, I'm sorry for winning.

428
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,160
This is a 20 bomb.

429
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,400
I have to fucking...

430
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,880
Do you not see the people doing jumping jacks around me?

431
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,660
Doing somersaults and flipping.

432
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,640
I'm fucking sorry.

433
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,260
Oh, my God.

434
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,660
Fucking criticize my ass in quick play.

435
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,340
I'm sorry.

436
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,300
I literally...

437
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,760
All I can do is just do damage.

438
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,380
Like my other...

439
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,780
My teammates fucking finish them off.

440
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,960
Like, oh, yeah.

441
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,780
The 12...

442
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,540
The 12k damage.

443
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,400
Helena was not doing her job.

444
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,440
All right.

445
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,140
Fuck you guys.

446
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,540
I'm playing Psylocke next.

447
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,340
Oh, I'm sorry.

448
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,060
Yeah.

449
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,580
Yeah, I did my job.

450
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,620
It doesn't matter.

451
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,480
Only 12k?

452
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,740
All right.

453
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,700
This person with the second most damage was 9k.

454
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,540
They're like 3k behind me.

455
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,520
Oh, my God.

456
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,620
Fucking ride my ass on quick play.

457
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,440
Why won't you?

458
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,660
Zach, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

459
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,020
Thank you.

460
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,680
Thank you.

461
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,220
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

462
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,220
This is...

463
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,940
This is exactly why I don't play DPS for you guys.

464
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,580
All right.

465
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,940
Back to Helena, I guess.

466
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,080
I guess.

467
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,140
It's back to Helena.

468
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,300
Why do I have to backfill?

469
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,520
I just want to play Psylocke so I can play ranked.

470
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,960
Oh, my God.

471
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,860
I swear to God.

472
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,660
If I...

473
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,020
If Jeff shows up...

474
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,560
Oh, thank God.

475
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,260
It's not me.

476
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,260
I was like, I swear to God.

477
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,680
We're waiting for the duo right now.

478
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,380
But also, like, I'm...

479
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,240
I wanted...

480
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,480
Of course, I have to backfill.

481
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,200
Of fucking course.

482
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,820
I...

483
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,620
Of course, I have to fucking backfill after I just...

484
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,280
I literally only queue up because I want to play Psylocke.

485
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,140
This is like the rare moments where I get to play DPS on my main.

486
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,340
A reason why I don't play DPS on ranked is because I don't...

487
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:18,600
I'm literally playing against, like, people who have been DPS players in Overwatch for, like...

488
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,960
For, like, seven years.

489
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,640
That's like...

490
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:26,960
Like...

491
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,460
Oh, please, group.

492
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,880
So, like, it's not worth it.

493
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,380
By the time I catch up to them, like, they're...

494
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,220
I'm just going to get shit on in general.

495
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,000
Like, literally, those are the DPS players I have to verse.

496
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,540
So, like, that's why I'm not even going to attempt.

497
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,740
Oh my god, he was 1 HP.

498
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,780
He was actually 1 HP.

499
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,260
I'm sad.

500
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,080
These...

501
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,120
These walls are, like, knotted.

502
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,740
I'm sorry.

503
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,000
Alright, there we go.

504
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,240
Yeah, like, that's why I'm, like, not...

505
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,860
Like, literally, I'm running into, like...

506
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,980
There's no way this car will save me.

507
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,800
Yeah, I was going to say, standing on this...

508
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,920
This car is literally the counter to Squirrel Girl.

509
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,580
I can literally stand there and we'll be okay.

510
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,000
Oh, fuck, I can't stand there anymore.

511
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,340
Yes, I'm not okay anymore.

512
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,880
It was...

513
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,320
It countered for, like, one second.

514
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,900
You know what?

515
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,680
Fuck it.

516
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,220
Oh my god, you're such a whore.

517
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,400
You have no friends.

518
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,780
You actually have no friends.

519
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,040
Fucking protect your shark, you idiot.

520
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,160
The waiting doll!

521
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,980
Oh my god, are you serious?

522
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,560
Wait, you didn't kill him?!

523
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,600
Okay.

524
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,040
That's fine.

525
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,960
He saw this in a video once and was like, this is it.

526
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,700
This is my time to use that shield.

527
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,080
Okay, come on.

528
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,820
Give me that bird.

529
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,140
I'm not even gonna do anything.

530
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,700
Oh my god, please.

531
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,000
Please.

532
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,040
Oh, he's so dead.

533
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,680
Oh, I'm so dead.

534
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,580
Oh, no!

535
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,970
Oh my god, how did I live?!

536
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,080
That's okay, Riot.

537
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,940
Push me.

538
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,000
That's right.

539
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,300
He's gonna start Grooting.

540
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,920
There's no way.

541
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,120
There's no way the Elevation's gonna fucking kill me.

542
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,800
Oh my god, he's actually...

543
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,100
I just needed to hit one shot.

544
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
I literally just needed to hit one shot there.

545
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,580
I'm sad.

546
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,660
I'm so sad.

547
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,820
I should grab my ult soon though, at least.

548
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,900
They're like, letting me farm it.

549
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,200
They don't see me, right?

550
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,400
They don't see me, right?

551
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,240
They don't see me, right?

552
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,600
That's fine.

553
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,800
Let me farm you.

554
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,700
Oh, but like, don't push up.

555
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,720
Don't walk up to me.

556
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,120
That's... that's illegal.

557
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,260
Oh, support!

558
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,100
He's literally walking up to you!

559
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,280
Oh, there's that!

560
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,600
Gamer awareness right there!

561
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,000
I like how he just...

562
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,700
He just walked up!

563
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,160
What are you doing?

564
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,020
What?

565
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,960
You know what?

566
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,140
I know you don't have...

567
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,340
I know you don't have...

568
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,960
Okay, what am I...

569
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Okay.

570
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,380
Alright, maybe I should've went a bit ahead though.

571
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,480
It's okay, this works still.

572
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,280
This works.

573
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:28,860
Thread the needle.

574
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,580
This works.

575
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,200
It still works, guys.

576
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,160
I threaded the needle.

577
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,000
What the fuck?

578
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,420
Okay.

579
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,700
That works too.

580
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,260
Thanks for the...

581
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:38,940
I guess...

582
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,560
Thanks for the...

583
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:42,900
Like...

584
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,760
I mean...

585
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,180
Okay.

586
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,800
That works too.

587
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,340
Alright.

588
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,600
That gave me...

589
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,000
Alright.

590
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,760
Thanks for the free...

591
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,360
I don't know.

592
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,980
Thanks for the angle, I guess.

593
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
I mean, it literally backfilled.

594
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,660
I backfilled and I...

595
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,420
Oh my god, our group was fucking them.

596
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,460
Our group was actually fucking.

597
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,360
Okay, guys.

598
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,160
One more quick play.

599
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,800
I need...

600
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,120
I need like...

601
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,700
5 v...

602
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,580
What am I?

603
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,800
What do you mean 5 v 6 and still 1?

604
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,580
I...

605
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,240
What am I to them?

606
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,620
Excuse...

607
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,240
Hello?

608
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,360
Hello?

609
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,780
Oh my god.

610
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,160
Oh my god.

611
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,300
I guess I'm not a...

612
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,380
I was there for like...

613
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,360
2 parts of the map.

614
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,560
You just...

615
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,040
I was there for 2 sections.

616
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,860
What do you mean?

617
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,960
Okay, thank you.

618
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,220
Alright.

619
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,220
Now...

620
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,060
Silence.

621
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,920
They called you a bot.

622
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,700
I...

623
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,660
I got kills.

624
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,180
I actually contributed to society.

625
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,520
What am I?

626
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,540
Kar and Kazoo, thank you for the 100 bitties.

627
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,980
Thank you.

628
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,800
Delta, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

629
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,200
Sleepy, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

630
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,240
Lingling, thank you.

631
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,440
Oh my god.

632
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,040
This is what happens when you try to contribute to society.

633
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,160
They don't appreciate you.

634
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,700
Alright.

635
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,520
Finally.

636
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,540
And we have no support.

637
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,260
Let's go.

638
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,940
That's fine.

639
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,080
You don't need support in...

640
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,240
In quick play.

641
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,220
Oh.

642
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,900
Oh, we have 2 people that left.

643
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,580
That's cool.

644
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,800
You can tell they...

645
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,640
They are willing to tank a 15 minute delay.

646
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,520
A 15 minute...

647
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,260
Delay just to not play support.

648
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,700
That's actually crazy.

649
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,360
That's actually crazy.

650
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,680
Imagine fucking tanking a 15 minute ban.

651
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,620
Just cause you...

652
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,500
Just don't...

653
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,420
You're just like, oh fuck.

654
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,960
That's enough Marvel Rivals today.

655
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,340
That's actually enough Marvel Rivals today.

656
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,340
Alright.

657
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:17,830
Woah!

658
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,050
What you gonna do?

659
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,590
Try to kill me?

660
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,470
Haha.

661
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,970
But where am I?

662
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,630
Oh.

663
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:28,790
Goodbye.

664
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:29,790
Okay.

665
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:30,850
That's not fair.

666
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,810
They have 2 supports.

667
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,290
Haha.

668
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,550
That's fucking right.

669
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,490
This is my health pack.

670
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,250
Alright.

671
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,350
I can't believe it.

672
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,610
They got the privilege of having 2 support players.

673
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,230
That's fucking insane.

674
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,430
This is not fair.

675
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,210
Haha.

676
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,050
This is actually not fair.

677
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,330
Oh no.

678
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,230
No.

679
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,230
And I literally saw our 1 support player die.

680
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,490
I deserved that.

681
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,390
I went into the...

682
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,190
I went into the Thor thing.

683
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,470
I thought I wasn't even gonna touch it.

684
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,790
Doki's DPS.

685
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,810
What you see here.

686
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,450
This is...

687
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:09,870
Um...

688
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,370
Quick play.

689
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,410
Haha.

690
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,150
This is...

691
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,650
It's not looking very great though.

692
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:19,890
Um...

693
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,650
I got the short end of the stick when it comes to like...

694
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:23,920
Um...

695
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,510
When it comes to like...

696
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:25,920
You know...

697
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,650
Quick play teammates.

698
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:28,810
Haha.

699
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,680
You know the...

700
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,570
Uh...

701
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,030
The no support players.

702
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,770
Cause everybody's like...

703
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,350
Why support?

704
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,090
When I play...

705
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,590
When I wanna play DPS.

706
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,190
Like...

707
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,510
Haha.

708
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,430
Why support?

709
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,210
Haha.

710
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,070
Haha.

711
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,350
Haha.

712
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,810
Alright.

713
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,590
So like...

714
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,350
This is the life we live in right now.

715
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,550
Uh...

716
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:53,970
Haha.

717
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,810
This is the...

718
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,410
We got the short end of the stick.

719
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,890
Alright.

720
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,530
Here we go.

721
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,950
I've come to bargain.

722
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,590
Oh no.

723
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,510
Is he gonna leave?

724
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:03,570
Haha.

725
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,090
Haha.

726
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,610
Did I already lost my...

727
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,970
My tank player?

728
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,010
That'd be very awkward.

729
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,690
Where's that rocket raccoon?

730
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,550
Oh my god.

731
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,150
I'm getting healed?

732
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,930
Oh my god.

733
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,270
I actually am getting healed.

734
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,170
That's insane.

735
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,630
Where are you going?

736
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,470
Ah!

737
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,770
Hahaha.

738
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:32,930
Oh fuck.

739
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:33,370
Okay.

740
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,570
I thought I could...

741
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,030
I didn't wanna die from that.

742
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:36,770
Guys.

743
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,490
It was either die from Psylocke or die from the clip.

744
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,990
I took my own way out.

745
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:42,830
I...

746
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,290
Haha.

747
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:43,910
I...

748
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,370
Haha.

749
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,190
You should...

750
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,690
I should've showed it here.

751
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,670
Alright guys.

752
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,650
I didn't wanna...

753
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,210
Guys, look.

754
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,730
I did not wanna die to Psylocke.

755
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,330
Although, okay.

756
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:53,950
It's...

757
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,990
I took my own way out of the game.

758
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:56,710
I...

759
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,050
It's not throwing!

760
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,750
I literally...

761
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,290
I wouldn't...

762
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,330
I didn't wanna die by her hands.

763
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,170
Alright.

764
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,550
It's not throwing cause like...

765
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,430
I chose my own exit.

766
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,750
Some would say I'm brave.

767
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,830
Some would say I'm a war hero.

768
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:12,950
Hahaha.

769
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,490
You know how like...

770
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,730
You know like...

771
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,110
Like...

772
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,130
Negotiations.

773
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,350
You got...

774
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,530
You're like a prisoner of war.

775
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,630
And you don't wanna...

776
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,130
You like...

777
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:22,910
You take that pill...

778
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,710
The pill in the...

779
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,210
In the...

780
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,190
In the mouth.

781
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,730
You know?

782
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,930
So you don't leak out the government secrets.

783
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:28,730
That's me.

784
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,650
That's me right now.

785
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,130
I took the pill.

786
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,470
So I can't leak the government secrets.

787
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,270
I'm so brave.

788
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,270
I should...

789
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,110
I deserve a medal for that.

790
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,650
The cyanide pill.

791
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,490
Oh man.

792
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,330
It's...

793
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,030
It's the bravest thing I could do.

794
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,670
Oh my god.

795
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,430
You're such a whore.

796
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,830
You're such a whore.

797
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,750
Oh my god.

798
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,650
Supports fucking holding each other's hands.

799
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:02,730
Okay.

800
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,270
There you go.

801
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,010
That's right.

802
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,330
Respawn right now.

803
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,370
Respawn.

804
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,890
Thank you.

805
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,230
Thank you for your service.

806
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,290
Alright.

807
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,310
I'm almost done with my quick play warm up.

808
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,350
The mouth.

809
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,150
Okay.

810
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,070
Alright, here we go.

811
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,650
That's fine.

812
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,710
I have not warmed up.

813
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,410
Alright, that's cool.

814
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,570
What?

815
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,450
You don't need it.

816
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,850
He doesn't need it.

817
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:49,950
Alright.

818
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,730
Ah, okay.

819
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,650
He doesn't need it.

820
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,490
I believe.

821
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,510
We just warm up straight.

822
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,290
We don't need to warm up.

823
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,790
We just hold right.

824
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,470
Damn.

825
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,630
What's your favorite DPS character?

826
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,670
Psylocke, currently.

827
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,350
She's really fun to play.

828
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,050
She doesn't require much aim.

829
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,990
Compared to the other characters.

830
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:25,350
I won't say she's like Scarlet Witch, but compared to the other characters, her aim is like...

831
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,130
Oh my god.

832
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,170
Fucking shit.

833
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,690
I don't even know what kill.

834
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,690
I got exploded.

835
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,910
I literally got exploded there.

836
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,610
Compared to the other characters, her aim is so easy.

837
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:45,390
The way you and your aim with her is like incredibly easy compared to like other characters.

838
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,070
You had a good aim.

839
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:59,190
Yeah, but like all I'm saying is that it's really easy to aim with her because her projectile speed is not that difficult to like figure out type deal.

840
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,390
Wait, where's our cloak?

841
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:02,570
Wait.

842
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:03,930
Wait.

843
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,730
Where is she?

844
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,510
Oh, there she is.

845
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,390
I don't know.

846
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:08,970
It's just...

847
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,990
It feels very...

848
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,490
Because it's like a little bit like hitscan.

849
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,690
Okay, I have ult, so like...

850
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,230
Alright.

851
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,410
Are you serious?

852
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,270
Okay.

853
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,910
Oh my god, you fucking bitch!

854
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,670
You couldn't save your raccoon!

855
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,670
You couldn't save your raccoon, though!

856
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,350
Oh, you saved your raccoon.

857
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,830
Yeah, she is hitscan.

858
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,250
That's what I mean.

859
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,690
Sorry, my brain is like...

860
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,570
I'm fucking angry.

861
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:44,810
That's why she's so easy to aim because she's basically hitscan.

862
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,030
And like, I don't have to fucking worry about projectile speed.

863
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,630
I hate Mantis aim.

864
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,310
Oh my god.

865
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,830
Mantis's projectile speed is stupid as fuck.

866
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,170
Like, it's like...

867
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,150
It's delayed.

868
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,490
And it like fucks with my head.

869
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,430
Oh my god.

870
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,070
You can like actually get crushed, so I'm scared.

871
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,290
Oh, I missed my right click.

872
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,150
I...

873
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,930
Thank god.

874
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,350
Why every time I talk shit, I talk shit and that happens to me.

875
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,550
Alright, there we go.

876
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,550
There we go.

877
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,650
Now I can do it.

878
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,210
There we go.

879
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,230
We're back.

880
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,490
We're back.

881
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,450
We're back.

882
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:21,770
Okay.

883
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,900
There we go.

884
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,800
Oh my god, she's one!

885
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
Oh my god!

886
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,660
Someone kill Syla!

887
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,520
That was my one and he won!

888
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,220
Oh my god.

889
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,340
The fucking Syla came out of nowhere.

890
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,720
I didn't want to get headshot.

891
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,680
I was like...

892
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,200
I tried...

893
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,060
I was scared of getting headshot by that fucker.

894
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,420
Okay.

895
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,460
There we go.

896
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,300
Oh shit, that's a Wolverine.

897
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,180
Bro, he's angry.

898
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,320
And he's fucking angry.

899
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,800
I was scared.

900
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,840
That was an angry man.

901
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,040
Is that everybody?

902
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,020
Are they all dead?

903
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,520
They're all dead.

904
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,040
There we go.

905
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,080
Oh!

906
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,760
Please, please, please, please.

907
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm scared.

908
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,820
He's dead, Doki.

909
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,460
Alright.

910
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,740
I mean, he's not getting...

911
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,060
I'm not getting healed either.

912
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,580
I play as if I...

913
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,200
I don't know.

914
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,760
I play as if I'm getting healed, but I keep forgetting that I'm one support.

915
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,260
I was like, oh hey, he's not even getting healed.

916
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,000
That's cool.

917
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,700
That's pretty sweet.

918
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,220
But then I'm also not getting healed.

919
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,020
So that's not sweet anymore.

920
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,460
Okay, that's funny.

921
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,840
Oh my god.

922
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,960
I could've died.

923
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,300
Oh my god.

924
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,260
They just backed out.

925
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,220
That should be illegal.

926
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,040
That...

927
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,320
They just...

928
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,440
They just...

929
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,500
They could just walk backwards.

930
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,820
They just walked backwards.

931
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,000
I don't know.

932
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,520
I thought that was a juicy ult.

933
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,600
I legitimately thought that was quite juicy there.

934
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,740
They just...

935
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,540
Actually...

936
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:29,780
Oh.

937
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,100
Oh, that was my only support.

938
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:32,800
Guys.

939
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,900
Are the health packs here?

940
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,460
Are they...

941
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,280
Guys, where are the health packs back here?

942
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:39,780
I don't...

943
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,940
I actually don't know.

944
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,040
Oh, he's gonna cocoon, isn't he?

945
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,860
Oh my god, I can't.

946
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,200
They're holding hands.

947
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:53,640
I...

948
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,960
How dare they walk away?

949
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,100
You can just do that?

950
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,260
Just walk away?

951
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,760
I...

952
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,640
You can...

953
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,740
Wow, I wish I could've done that.

954
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,720
Oh my god.

955
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,740
You can...

956
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,620
Oh my god.

957
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,460
Why have I thought of that before when I get Psylocke ulted?

958
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,900
I don't understand.

959
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,400
How come when I get Psylocke ulted, I can't just walk away?

960
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,740
But when they Psylocke...

961
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,800
When I Psylocke ult, they can just walk away like that.

962
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,960
Like...

963
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,900
Is this a quick play buff?

964
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:34,820
Is this...

965
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,520
They have...

966
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:42,860
Honestly...

967
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,500
No, that's...

968
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,320
If anybody that should swap, it should be a Black Panther.

969
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,100
At least, like, even though I'm, like, playing like ass right now.

970
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,060
At least, like, I'm contributing a bit more than this guy.

971
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,480
He is definitely not Wakanda forever right now.

972
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,540
He's like...

973
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,360
No Wakanda today.

974
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,700
The S key count...

975
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,820
I know it's actually crazy.

976
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,100
I never expected that.

977
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,980
Oh, look at him.

978
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,700
He's, like, waiting.

979
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,420
He's like, ooh.

980
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,120
Oh, are you coming over, Thor?

981
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,980
I'm on, Thor.

982
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,320
What the fuck is wrong with you?

983
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,840
What the fuck is wrong with...

984
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,460
Where's your...

985
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,080
Yes, right.

986
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,400
Where's your support?

987
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,700
Oh, there he is.

988
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,860
Oh, there's your support, I guess.

989
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,000
Yup.

990
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,920
Just walk away.

991
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,260
That's what they did to me.

992
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:39,960
Just...

993
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,660
That's not fair.

994
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,440
That's actually not fair.

995
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,300
That's...

996
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,660
That's not fair.

997
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,660
He has an Adam and a Rocket, baby.

998
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,420
Fuck me, I guess.

999
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,660
Wakanda, not even briefly, forever.

1000
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,260
That's actually not fair.

1001
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,120
Not fair.

1002
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,760
It should...

1003
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,970
It should be banned...

1004
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,640
from existing.

1005
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,960
Oh my god, who?

1006
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,820
Who's fucking shooting me?

1007
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,140
I have to play on this just for any sense of healing.

1008
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,630
You know what, fuck this.

1009
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,070
Oh my god, you just walk away!

1010
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,150
I still got him!

1011
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,010
I don't...

1012
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,490
I don't even...

1013
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,750
I still got him!

1014
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,990
I don't even know how!

1015
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,170
Okay, that's fine.

1016
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,750
I'm okay with that.

1017
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:46,070
I still got it, baby.

1018
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,340
I still got it.

1019
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,100
I'm fine.

1020
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,160
I'm okay with that.

1021
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,620
That's fucking right.

1022
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,460
Be gone!

1023
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,060
Oh my god, they got so much.

1024
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,960
Oh, I had to...

1025
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
I guess I'll contest point, guys.

1026
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:13,880
I...

1027
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,180
I guess...

1028
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,740
I guess...

1029
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,060
I guess I'll contest the point for us.

1030
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,660
My little squishy body.

1031
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,360
That's fine.

1032
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,140
How does our panther still have zero...

1033
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,660
He has gained zero kills!

1034
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,900
In this one round!

1035
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,680
How do you not have any kills in the one round?

1036
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,500
In one full round!

1037
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,280
That's actually crazy.

1038
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,860
Is there anything I can do?

1039
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,600
Walk back?

1040
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,980
To cap the point?

1041
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,240
That'd be a crazy thing to do.

1042
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,400
I don't need it.

1043
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,240
What?

1044
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,860
Oh my god, I...

1045
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,700
No, I couldn't.

1046
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,100
I thought that was a wall.

1047
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,940
I thought that was an entranceway.

1048
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,080
And I was like, wait a minute.

1049
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,580
Wait a minute.

1050
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,680
I can't go in.

1051
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,680
Go through there.

1052
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,620
Please back, black panther.

1053
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,760
Do one kill.

1054
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,920
Black panther, please!

1055
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,540
Kill one person!

1056
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,740
I mean, I knew it.

1057
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,700
Oh my gosh.

1058
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,880
I couldn't mute myself in time.

1059
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,000
Please.

1060
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,500
Oh my god.

1061
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:31,680
Black panther, how did you not get one kill in one entire round?

1062
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,760
Oh my god.

1063
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,000
I couldn't...

1064
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,760
Bro did not get a single kill in one fucking round.

1065
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,860
That's actually crazy.

1066
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:46,800
That's alright.

1067
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,540
He's having fun.

1068
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,180
It's quick play.

1069
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,120
Let him have fun.

1070
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,900
Not sure why black panther was here.

1071
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,760
At least, like, it's quick play.

1072
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,860
You lose it.

1073
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,980
Don't talk to me ever again.

1074
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:09,140
What a great time, team.

1075
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,820
Oh my god.

1076
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,980
That's a marvel, baby.

1077
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,060
Oh my god.

1078
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,880
Don't talk to me ever again.

1079
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,980
By kindness and example.

1080
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,380
Why are you so bad?

1081
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,040
I don't know.

1082
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,400
I don't know why they're so bad.

1083
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,980
That was wild.

1084
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,240
Oh my god.

1085
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,240
Holy shit.

1086
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:47,860
I like how he's like, don't talk to me ever again.

1087
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,820
Holy shit.

1088
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,980
He's been through things.

1089
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,540
He's been through a lot.

1090
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,330
Average quick play moment.

1091
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:07,810
Wakanda never.

1092
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,190
Guys, I don't think he's...

1093
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,310
I don't think he's feeling Wakanda today.

1094
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,670
I can't believe Doki said it's rivaling time and then marveled all over.

1095
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,350
Guys, in five days, I'll return back to normal.

1096
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,790
I swear to god, chat.

1097
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,910
Five days, guys.

1098
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:30,210
We're gonna be back to normal and then we'll move back to YouTube for regular content.

1099
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,370
I'm planning on streaming on Twitch more.

1100
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,050
But not, like, as much as I am right now.

1101
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,610
Because, like I said, I'm putting all the Marvel rank grind on Twitch.

1102
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,270
Because it's just easier.

1103
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,230
I like to put scheduled content on YouTube.

1104
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,750
Because, like I said, I don't know when I'm ever streaming rank.

1105
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,270
It's always, like, so fucking random whenever I'm doing rank streams.

1106
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,430
So that's why I don't put it on YouTube.

1107
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,350
Because also I need to get a thumbnail made.

1108
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,970
I need to get a thumbnail made.

1109
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,090
I need to, like, put up the waiting room.

1110
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:59,290
I need to, like...

1111
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:01,130
It's just a little bit too much work.

1112
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,930
And, like, it's just...

1113
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,670
Yeah, that's why I just...

1114
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,770
I'd rather just put it on Twitch.

1115
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,490
And then later on, I put, like...

1116
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,950
I'm gonna have an edited VOD.

1117
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,110
Also, it's just really expensive.

1118
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,810
Because, like, okay, so...

1119
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,770
Okay, I shouldn't talk about expensive.

1120
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:20,870
But, like...

1121
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,310
Because I don't know when I'm gonna do Marvel...

1122
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,330
Oh, we're doing quick play.

1123
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:24,790
Okay, alright.

1124
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:25,330
Oh, okay.

1125
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:25,990
One quick play.

1126
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:26,550
Alright, that's cool.

1127
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:27,310
I'll be right back.

1128
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,390
Actually, I'm gonna get...

1129
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,210
I'm gonna get...

1130
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,910
Cough drop real quick.

1131
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,550
And I'm back.

1132
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,410
It's just easier to, like...

1133
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,870
Have it all on Twitch.

1134
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,690
And then have an edited VOD of the grind.

1135
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,470
Because I don't know how long it's gonna fucking take me.

1136
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,670
Alright, let's warm up on Luna.

1137
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:08,790
Let's fucking go on quick...

1138
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:09,690
Is this quick play still?

1139
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,190
Still quick play.

1140
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:17,270
What?

1141
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,470
What is XM?

1142
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,310
Lou, I'm sorry.

1143
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,730
Booger's also a tank player.

1144
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,450
And I don't know if I wanna...

1145
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:38,690
With probability's sake, I don't know if we can have two tanks on one squad.

1146
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,690
But don't worry.

1147
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:41,910
Don't worry.

1148
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:42,930
The next spot...

1149
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,990
The next spot is yours, Lou.

1150
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,510
Don't worry, Lou.

1151
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,510
The next spot is yours.

1152
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,750
Alright, fuck this Ironman.

1153
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,790
He doesn't deserve it.

1154
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,690
Fuck this Ironman.

1155
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,770
You're gonna learn how to play without a Luna.

1156
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,230
Without a Luna crutch.

1157
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,170
Guys, I'm waiting for my gamer subs to kick in right now.

1158
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,450
If I'm not hitting anything, it's only because...

1159
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,870
My gamer subs have yet to...

1160
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,390
Oh my god, my gamer subs have yet to kick in.

1161
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,430
My gamer...

1162
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,490
Oh my god.

1163
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:24,130
Okay.

1164
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:25,930
My gamer subs have yet to...

1165
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,550
I would have...

1166
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,350
Oh my god.

1167
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:32,030
Guys, it's just because my gamer subs have yet to kick in.

1168
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,270
Okay.

1169
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,250
Also, I have a...

1170
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:35,750
Oh my god.

1171
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:36,110
Why...

1172
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,450
Why would you have fun playing Rocky Raccoon?

1173
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,310
And fucking Whistler, of all things.

1174
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,630
Like, alright, now it's on.

1175
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,010
It's on.

1176
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,450
It's okay.

1177
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,570
It's kicked in now.

1178
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,930
Guys, it's actually...

1179
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:49,750
It's kicked in now.

1180
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,010
How?

1181
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:58,390
How do you have fun playing Rocky Raccoon in quick play?

1182
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,330
I don't understand.

1183
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:02,170
How?

1184
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,850
There we go.

1185
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,450
That's the gamer subs keep talking.

1186
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:13,170
But guys, speaking of gamer subs, if you use my code, you can get...

1187
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,070
You can...

1188
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:14,890
What reminder?

1189
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,170
What is this reminder?

1190
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:26,250
If you use my code, DokiBrewed, you get 10% off on any order you make on gamersubs.com.

1191
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,270
Is that crazy?

1192
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,330
Oh my god.

1193
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,390
I got, like, hit up.

1194
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:34,470
So...

1195
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,050
Please.

1196
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:35,930
Please.

1197
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,530
He's just walking up to me.

1198
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:39,370
Please.

1199
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:44,190
Don't let him just walk up to me.

1200
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,050
Please.

1201
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:49,750
I can't.

1202
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:52,070
I fucking can't with this team.

1203
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:55,710
They just let him walk up to me.

1204
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,010
Counter hit with S.

1205
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:01,250
Please, at least kill Venom.

1206
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,450
There we go.

1207
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,470
Alright, we're fine.

1208
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:08,810
We're just warming up.

1209
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,120
Get fucking in.

1210
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,140
Get fucking hit.

1211
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:15,900
Get head.

1212
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:17,540
Alright.

1213
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,080
See?

1214
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,040
It's so easy.

1215
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,820
We're so warmed up now.

1216
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,940
It's kicked in, guys.

1217
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,780
It's kicked in for real.

1218
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,000
We don't talk about that miss there, but it's kicked in, guys.

1219
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,280
I swear to god.

1220
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,640
Alright, who's just walking up to me?

1221
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,380
Okay, there you are.

1222
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,980
Please, do not let him just walk up to us.

1223
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:40,760
Okay.

1224
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:42,700
See?

1225
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,560
He's so healthy.

1226
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,640
He's so healthy.

1227
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,540
Everything is so healthy.

1228
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,400
Alright, I just get that nasty.

1229
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,280
I only get that one good freeze and I know I'm ready.

1230
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,820
Like right now.

1231
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:57,980
Okay.

1232
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,740
It would've hit, guys.

1233
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,480
This would've hit, guys.

1234
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,300
I swear to god.

1235
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,980
You didn't see it because it faded out.

1236
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,840
If it played a little bit longer, that freeze would've hit.

1237
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,200
You could've seen it.

1238
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,960
You should've been there.

1239
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,000
You should've been there, guys.

1240
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,640
It was crazy.

1241
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:38,540
Guys, this is supposed to be like an echo chamber of praise.

1242
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,960
If I wouldn't get flamed...

1243
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,940
If I wouldn't get flamed right now, I'd be on Twitter.

1244
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:51,780
No.

1245
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,860
The tone of love.

1246
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,340
Alright, let's go.

1247
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,680
Alright, I need to know where my hate watchers are.

1248
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,580
Where are my hate watchers in chat?

1249
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:10,920
Me!

1250
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:11,580
That's me!

1251
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,820
That's me!

1252
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,120
She's talking about me!

1253
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,100
Oh my god!

1254
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,280
Oh my god.

1255
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,240
She's actually talking about me.

1256
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,900
She mentioned me.

1257
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,680
Oh my god, streamer fucking mentioned me.

1258
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,440
Oh my god, I don't know why I pressed that freeze there.

1259
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,560
I just felt a little cocky today, I guess.

1260
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,620
He's so healthy.

1261
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,140
Look at him go.

1262
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,380
He's so fucking healthy.

1263
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,880
Oh, that's fine.

1264
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,500
That's fine.

1265
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,660
This strange was not.

1266
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,100
I'm just here to make sure he has a good time.

1267
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,400
Alright, strange.

1268
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,420
Okay, what?

1269
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:55,560
Okay!

1270
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,640
Is he okay?

1271
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,560
Oh my god.

1272
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:02,840
Nice.

1273
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,480
Where did he go?

1274
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,140
There you go.

1275
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,320
Is the gamer sub crew that makes you cocky?

1276
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:11,940
True.

1277
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,980
True, I'm getting my energy back now.

1278
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,780
Thoughts on Moon Knight?

1279
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,140
Only good on certain maps.

1280
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,940
And even then, he's like...

1281
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,500
He's only good on like, what?

1282
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,840
Two maps, I feel like.

1283
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,880
The other maps, he's like, not great in.

1284
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,660
Not really like, something you should play.

1285
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,600
Because there's, it's like, it's very map dependent.

1286
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,520
Because if...

1287
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,880
Oh my, what is that?

1288
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,060
What the fuck is that movement?

1289
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,280
It's a little like, gyrate.

1290
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,580
It's a little circle.

1291
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,500
He's like, gyrating in the sky.

1292
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,840
Skill and shit.

1293
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,140
I'm just like, bro, what the fuck?

1294
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,420
And this is why you, people normally give the orb to Ironman.

1295
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,560
Because he's fucking held it.

1296
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,720
He's got the moves.

1297
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,280
I was like, what the fuck?

1298
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,500
What is this gyration?

1299
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,040
It's like, he's like, fucking or some shit.

1300
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,640
He's gotta keep practicing, that's for sure.

1301
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,780
He's in.

1302
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,580
He's like, hip thrusting in the air.

1303
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,860
You see how I put an orb on the Ironman?

1304
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,640
I've given up.

1305
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,540
I've...

1306
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,600
That's why they're like, guys gotta give...

1307
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,600
Why me?

1308
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,420
Why me?

1309
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,040
I'm fucking one person.

1310
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,500
That little lower accurate.

1311
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,720
Tony Stark.

1312
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:52,820
Yay.

1313
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,800
It was like, got him married.

1314
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,220
Alright, nice.

1315
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,260
Everything will be fine.

1316
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,140
No, I'm gonna put it on the Ironman.

1317
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,560
I can't, I can't deal with his movement right now.

1318
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,860
I'm not, I'm not into it.

1319
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,540
It ain't cool.

1320
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,660
What's he gonna do?

1321
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,880
Like, what are you trying to do?

1322
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,000
Okay.

1323
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,680
That's fine.

1324
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,260
That's fine.

1325
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,060
That's fine.

1326
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:26,540
That's fine.

1327
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,060
I have ult.

1328
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,100
You don't have to heal me.

1329
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,440
It's fine, Raccoon.

1330
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,380
It's fine.

1331
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,360
I know that healing me is not it.

1332
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,440
It's okay.

1333
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,160
GG.

1334
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,200
Just ignore me.

1335
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:38,980
Boar Nation.

1336
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,020
Try to blame the healer.

1337
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,720
Yeah, no spot for now.

1338
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,380
For now playing with Ogre at the moment.

1339
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:55,000
Two tanks is a bit too risky.

1340
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:03,840
It's too risky because we might get queued into a team that also has tank players.

1341
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,860
And like, I feel like I feel more comfortable having tank DPS than two tanks together.

1342
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,740
We're min-maxing right now.

1343
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,320
Guys, I can't.

1344
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,720
I'm not.

1345
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,080
I don't want to do a full five days, guys.

1346
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:24,700
I don't know if I can do a full five days of just playing ranked.

1347
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,840
Non-stop.

1348
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,900
I don't know.

1349
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,220
It's not.

1350
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,280
I don't think it's.

1351
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,220
That's why I'm min-maxing.

1352
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,140
That is exactly why I have the min-max chat.

1353
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,960
Everyone does it.

1354
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,320
I ain't the first one that invented it.

1355
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,260
Min-maxing stacks has been a thing since competitive.

1356
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,360
Halo people.

1357
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,900
It's been a thing since CSGO.

1358
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,440
It's been a thing since Halo multiplayer.

1359
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:00,740
It's been a thing since, I don't know, whatever came before Halo.

1360
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,820
Everybody does it.

1361
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,080
Since the dawn of humanity, exactly.

1362
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,980
And it's my turn to min-max.

1363
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:12,900
Oh, I'm against super.

1364
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,700
Who's on my team?

1365
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,420
I have no idea who's on my team.

1366
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,780
I know I'm against super though.

1367
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,160
Alright, here we go.

1368
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:29,180
Bad mage in Subway is useless?

1369
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,660
Who the fuck is Subway?

1370
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,340
The chain?

1371
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,160
Alright.

1372
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,420
I guess we bad magic?

1373
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:41,780
I don't know.

1374
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,180
I guess we bad magic.

1375
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,200
He's playing magic player.

1376
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,540
Wait, but we have a magic player.

1377
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,180
I eat fresh.

1378
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,280
Wait, but like, we have a magic player though.

1379
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:04,490
We just...

1380
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:05,910
Wait, we have a...

1381
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:06,830
Okay, I was gonna say.

1382
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,870
I guess we're gonna have to have an Ironman play.

1383
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,610
Oh, no, I have to play against a fucking...

1384
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,810
If this guy, if the enemy Hulk just W-keys me.

1385
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:18,610
And like, and my team just watches this happen.

1386
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,530
I will...

1387
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,950
I will not be okay.

1388
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,710
Oh, we should have...

1389
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,370
We should have banned Ironman then.

1390
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,570
Do we even have an Ironman player?

1391
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:35,270
Do we have a DPS player?

1392
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:38,830
Okay.

1393
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,210
That's not Ironman, but like, it's close enough.

1394
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,710
I guess it's close enough.

1395
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:43,710
He's red.

1396
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:44,370
She's purple.

1397
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,890
That's practically Ironman.

1398
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,620
She's hitscan.

1399
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,860
He's whatever the fuck he is.

1400
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,840
Okay, we...

1401
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,080
Okay.

1402
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:09,070
Okay, well, they are...

1403
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:12,370
Go heal, I'll go arm.

1404
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:12,770
Okay.

1405
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,030
Alright, that should be fine.

1406
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:17,180
And then...

1407
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,270
Oh, hey, look, he has a Hulk too.

1408
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:21,070
There he goes.

1409
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:23,170
Oh, he has a Wolverine as well.

1410
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,130
Oh, thank god I'm not tank.

1411
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,910
Oh, they're practicing baseball.

1412
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,830
They're practicing.

1413
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:40,370
Oh my god, they're practicing the tech right now.

1414
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,470
That's funny.

1415
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:47,730
They're trying out the tech.

1416
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:52,600
Oh.

1417
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,220
Yeah, Wolverine.

1418
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,780
Well, there's the Wolverine.

1419
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,000
Nice kill there.

1420
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,200
I mean, there was the Wolverine.

1421
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:16,660
I was right.

1422
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:17,740
I'm walking.

1423
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:22,440
Change is low.

1424
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:25,840
Alright, nice.

1425
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,180
Nice.

1426
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,860
Oh, wait, Hulk is one.

1427
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,980
Oh my god, oh my god, please.

1428
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:40,860
Please, I had so much practice with the gyrating Wolverine.

1429
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,360
I was like, hey, they have a Wolverine.

1430
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,360
And then, like, my Hulk just disappeared.

1431
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,880
My Hulk just fucking got deleted.

1432
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,200
Alright, help, Mary.

1433
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,000
Normally, I shouldn't do that, though.

1434
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,360
That's, like, actually...

1435
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,480
Oh my god.

1436
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,120
Oh my god, you fucking broke the map.

1437
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:12,940
That's fine.

1438
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:17,900
Wait, get the Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

1439
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:18,920
So you just have to...

1440
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,400
Come on, just dash.

1441
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,740
Strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange.

1442
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:25,920
You can mental assault first.

1443
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,980
Okay, oh, that's awkward.

1444
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,420
That's so awkward.

1445
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,520
That's fine, everything will be okay.

1446
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:41,140
Everything will be okay, guys.

1447
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,460
We're so healthy.

1448
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,420
Oh, I don't think they used... they didn't use any of their ults.

1449
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,540
Oh, they have everything.

1450
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,400
I have no mag.

1451
01:02:58,740 --> 01:02:59,280
That's fine.

1452
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:01,520
What?

1453
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,680
Oh, shit.

1454
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:07,940
Hulk in the backline.

1455
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:09,440
Watch out the wall.

1456
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,660
Okay, I have Hulk 1, Hulk 1.

1457
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,440
I'm ulting this after?

1458
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,080
We're in the backline.

1459
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,480
Oh, I'm ulting point.

1460
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,860
If we could just play on point.

1461
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,040
Just play on point.

1462
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:27,600
I don't think we can... we don't need ult anymore.

1463
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,860
Oh, it's fine.

1464
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,540
It's fine.

1465
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,380
Everything is fine.

1466
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,200
We got 99.

1467
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:36,780
We got 99.

1468
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,520
They used Mantis, Strange ult.

1469
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:42,540
No more ult.

1470
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,240
I think they used everything.

1471
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,700
Did they use Logang?

1472
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,200
Oh, they didn't use Berserker.

1473
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,900
Oh yeah, they didn't use Berserker, yeah.

1474
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,460
Why does this game look like it's a hero shooter?

1475
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,360
Oh, there we go.

1476
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,560
I'm scared of the Wolverine.

1477
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,220
Oh, are you okay, Strange?

1478
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,700
Oh, I fucking hate this.

1479
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,220
Wait, Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna!

1480
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:19,960
Luna's one, Luna's one!

1481
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,980
Yeah, I'm on there, I'm on there.

1482
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,860
Oh, I'm the only support left.

1483
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,820
I might die.

1484
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:26,440
It's fine.

1485
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:27,660
We can win this.

1486
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:33,240
Wait, no, Mantis is alive!

1487
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,540
Wait, Wolverine's low too.

1488
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:36,960
Wolverine no passive.

1489
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,380
No passive, no passive.

1490
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,620
Wolves is a game.

1491
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,240
I'm chilling, I'm chilling.

1492
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,280
Run, run, run, run for your life.

1493
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:48,760
Get a Hulk.

1494
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,040
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

1495
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,260
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

1496
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,100
Hulk is one!

1497
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:55,920
Hulk one!

1498
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:58,980
Strange is portaling.

1499
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,120
I'm stunning him.

1500
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:00,860
Yeah, it's fine.

1501
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,680
They're not on Strange, they're not on...

1502
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:02,880
Oh.

1503
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:03,620
Wolverine here.

1504
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:04,340
Whoa!

1505
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:06,580
Wolverine.

1506
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,800
Logang, Logang, Logang.

1507
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,640
Strange is half.

1508
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,740
Strange is one, Strange is one.

1509
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:13,520
Hello?

1510
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:16,260
I'm a Hulk.

1511
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:19,820
That's fine.

1512
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,800
We're so healthy.

1513
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,260
Wait, did I freeze?

1514
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,480
Oh my gosh, things are like blurring together and I don't even know if I freeze.

1515
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,820
To be fair, when he said Logang, I was like, Logan Paul?

1516
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,020
Just like, I'm like, who's Logan Paul?

1517
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,320
Just like...

1518
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,840
I literally flaked out.

1519
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,720
I was like, did they Logang all?

1520
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,680
I'm like, who the fuck?

1521
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,000
What did Logan Paul do?

1522
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,960
I forgot that Logan...

1523
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,880
Logang is...

1524
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:55,540
is...

1525
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,640
is Wolverine.

1526
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,500
I know his name is Logan, but like, I don't know.

1527
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:03,700
I just...

1528
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,280
My mind instantly went to Logan Paul.

1529
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:11,420
Great game's trash.

1530
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,420
It only took a month for him to hate the game.

1531
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,800
What a character arc.

1532
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,740
The brain cell...

1533
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,720
My brain rot has settled in.

1534
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:29,740
I've actually rotted away all my brain cells from this game.

1535
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,800
They definitely have Strange all here.

1536
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,000
Yeah, it's got Strange diffs.

1537
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,100
There's a Logang.

1538
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,520
Logang left side, guys.

1539
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,740
Look, this is literally the first time I've heard the comm of...

1540
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:47,640
Oh, he's pitching.

1541
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,800
He's doing baseball.

1542
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,560
He missed.

1543
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,140
I'm out.

1544
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,600
I'm trying to run for it.

1545
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,080
He fucking missed.

1546
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,280
I can touch.

1547
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,180
For a little bit.

1548
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,080
Logang's on me.

1549
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:00,800
Logang!

1550
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,160
What?!

1551
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,860
How did that kill me fully?!

1552
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,020
I was at the edge!

1553
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:10,020
Look at me!

1554
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,280
I was at the edge!

1555
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,620
I was...

1556
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:13,320
What?!

1557
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,840
I would've been shut down, not fully killed.

1558
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,340
He's coming for me.

1559
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:18,960
I'm terrified.

1560
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,540
That's actually...

1561
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:23,060
Wait, he ulted.

1562
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,020
I was at the fucking edge!

1563
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,180
That's actually bullshit.

1564
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,780
That's actually bullshit.

1565
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,020
That should not have hit me.

1566
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,800
Legitimately, that should not have hit me.

1567
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,500
We can Mantis in first if needed.

1568
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,280
Logang, guys.

1569
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:47,760
Logang.

1570
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,180
Oh, how far...

1571
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:53,660
Okay.

1572
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,740
Alright, here we go.

1573
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,120
I'm damage boosting this.

1574
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,700
Oh, he's looking for a solo!

1575
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,520
Oh no, I'm thinking Logan Paul now.

1576
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,420
I meant Wolf.

1577
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:14,860
Logan Paul!

1578
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,380
I'm sorry, my brain rots!

1579
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,460
I just did not intentionally mean Logan Paul.

1580
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,780
I feel it in my ass, bro.

1581
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,120
This guy's in me.

1582
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:25,740
Portal behind, portal behind!

1583
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,040
Logang in.

1584
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:28,700
I'm on sports.

1585
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,040
I have Hulk on me.

1586
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,040
Hulk is on me.

1587
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,020
I stunned him, I stunned him.

1588
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:38,860
No!

1589
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:39,520
Goodbye.

1590
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,020
I'm dead.

1591
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,300
What have I become?

1592
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,040
Wait, did we not win this?

1593
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:51,820
I thought we were up more.

1594
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,660
No, we didn't win.

1595
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:54,940
I'm coming back.

1596
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,280
Can we not contest for it?

1597
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:58,440
Okay.

1598
01:08:58,740 --> 01:08:59,200
Logang.

1599
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,080
My brain rots.

1600
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,480
It's not great.

1601
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,100
I think it's not a great thing.

1602
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,600
Oh my god, I didn't realize he was right beside me.

1603
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:21,040
If I knew he was right beside me, I would have done...

1604
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,220
Oh, we're up two.

1605
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:22,960
We should push up.

1606
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,600
There's a Hulk on me.

1607
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:26,760
Hulk one, Hulk one.

1608
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,800
Oh, I'm dead.

1609
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,080
Please!

1610
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,380
I'm getting juggled by Hulk.

1611
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,440
Can I help you?

1612
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:38,860
I don't know.

1613
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,100
He's low, he's one, he's one.

1614
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:43,780
Get him, get him.

1615
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:44,700
Leave him, leave him.

1616
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,320
Don't kill him.

1617
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:46,440
Down, guys.

1618
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:49,900
Good job, guys.

1619
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,040
Oh my god.

1620
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,900
This is why I hate playing against Hulk players.

1621
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:57,620
Wolverine's to the right.

1622
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:00,220
He's looking for...

1623
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:00,600
He's half.

1624
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:01,660
Shoot Logang.

1625
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:03,920
He wants me, bro.

1626
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,600
I stunned him.

1627
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,300
I have Wolverine on me.

1628
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:09,700
He's frozen.

1629
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:10,380
Roadhog's frozen.

1630
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,490
I'm with the Mantis.

1631
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,510
I have to back out in two seconds.

1632
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:23,190
I'm backing out.

1633
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,030
Mantis dead.

1634
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:27,150
Oh my god, please!

1635
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:31,210
I tried to save you, Mantis!

1636
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,190
Oh my god!

1637
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:37,390
We have portal.

1638
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:39,930
Bro, I can't move.

1639
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:40,630
Oh my god.

1640
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:42,670
You got portal now, Fabi.

1641
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:44,570
Get on!

1642
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:50,590
I see him, I see him.

1643
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:51,250
Huge ult, huge ult.

1644
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:54,670
Icebro's Hulk.

1645
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:00,950
Jesus Christ.

1646
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:05,330
Mantis on me, Mantis on me, Mantis on me.

1647
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:06,570
I can't see you, Ironman.

1648
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:07,190
I can't see you.

1649
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:08,550
Psylocke?

1650
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:09,110
Psylocke low.

1651
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,390
Psylocke.

1652
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:10,950
Oh.

1653
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:11,110
Oh.

1654
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:14,390
That was an insane animal.

1655
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,450
Oh my god.

1656
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,790
Oh god, they sub one fight.

1657
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:20,090
Maybe we can get a kill here and win the game.

1658
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:21,670
I think they have a portal.

1659
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,010
Maybe?

1660
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:25,910
Yeah, they do, they do, they do, they do.

1661
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:31,210
They're on point.

1662
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:33,030
Our Strange needs help.

1663
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:35,290
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1664
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:36,310
I bowled him.

1665
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:37,730
Kill the support, kill the support.

1666
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:38,310
Strange is frozen.

1667
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,580
How about Strange?

1668
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,460
He's getting Rogan.

1669
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,060
Oh, this is bad.

1670
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,700
Oh, that's bad.

1671
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:49,900
I have a Psylocke on me.

1672
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:50,520
I'm Strange.

1673
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,820
Oh my god.

1674
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,040
Yeah, they had portal.

1675
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,180
That portal was clutch for them.

1676
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,840
Oh my god, there was no...

1677
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,580
I didn't have ult.

1678
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,400
They had both support ults there.

1679
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:20,070
Backwards!

1680
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:26,110
Guys, you saw me walk backwards.

1681
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,890
Why doesn't that work for me?

1682
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,390
I don't understand.

1683
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:34,390
Wait, I walked backwards.

1684
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:37,570
I walked backwards.

1685
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,330
What am I supposed to do?

1686
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:50,970
Walking backwards is so hard.

1687
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:54,470
Let's just walk backwards better.

1688
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:55,970
Ow!

1689
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:59,450
My legs don't work like that.

1690
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,270
This is...

1691
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:07,610
Who the fuck was your ma...

1692
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:08,990
Oh, it's the subway surfer.

1693
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:09,530
What is he...

1694
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,350
What was he playing?

1695
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,130
He was...

1696
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:12,690
Oh, he was playing Psylocke.

1697
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:13,350
Okay.

1698
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,650
I feel like we should just ban Wolverine.

1699
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,870
Instead of, like, magic.

1700
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:20,090
I'd rather just freeze fucking...

1701
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,090
Psylocke on me.

1702
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,090
I have Hulk.

1703
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:26,770
Hulk on me.

1704
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:29,890
Hulk and Wolverine.

1705
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:32,510
Oh shit.

1706
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:33,670
Oh my god.

1707
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:34,830
A Hulk half!

1708
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:37,430
Hulk one, Hulk one!

1709
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:38,030
Any heals?

1710
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:38,410
Any heals?

1711
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:39,350
I'm like one.

1712
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:39,910
He's up.

1713
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:40,430
Can we kill him?

1714
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:41,350
Kill the Hulk, maybe?

1715
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:42,450
I can bubble this.

1716
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:42,790
Okay.

1717
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:43,650
Bubble the strength.

1718
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:45,950
I want Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

1719
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:47,450
I got...

1720
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:48,090
Wait, what?!

1721
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:49,590
What?!

1722
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,890
My pick is...

1723
01:13:58,450 --> 01:13:58,970
What?!

1724
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:01,850
I'm mad.

1725
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:02,970
I actually...

1726
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:03,350
Mad is low.

1727
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:03,810
Mad is low.

1728
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:07,010
Wulgan, Wulgan, guys.

1729
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:07,770
Wulgan's gonna kill everyone.

1730
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:08,630
Wolverine half.

1731
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:11,290
I'm so fucking mad.

1732
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:12,070
Like...

1733
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,770
Hulk one, Hulk one.

1734
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,630
It actually went off my screen!

1735
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,970
This is exactly why I banned the East Coast.

1736
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:21,930
What?!

1737
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:23,730
Actually...

1738
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:26,090
Actually pinged him!

1739
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,610
Like...

1740
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,630
I have to predict the future 20 seconds in!

1741
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:35,130
I got Wolverine ult here, too.

1742
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:37,250
Yeah, they do.

1743
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,170
Oh my god.

1744
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,970
Wulgan half, Wulgan half, Wulgan, Wulgan.

1745
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:46,810
He's solo.

1746
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:49,890
Oh my god.

1747
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,870
Like, what do you do in that situation?

1748
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:56,210
I'm walking backwards!

1749
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:58,150
I think we should fight on point.

1750
01:14:58,390 --> 01:14:59,050
Just get the...

1751
01:14:59,050 --> 01:14:59,770
Oh, never mind.

1752
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:03,850
Never mind.

1753
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:05,230
We all walked out of point.

1754
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,020
That sucks.

1755
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,180
Wait, Wolverine one, Wolverine one.

1756
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,500
Guess I'm here.

1757
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,180
Oh my god.

1758
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:19,380
Like, I don't understand why we didn't fight on point with the Mantis ult.

1759
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,960
We literally just needed to walk to the point with the Mantis ult.

1760
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,680
That's literally all we had to do.

1761
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:28,460
Please.

1762
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,160
Hulk on our Mantis.

1763
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:38,580
Oh my god, please.

1764
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,440
Please.

1765
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,020
I'm like...

1766
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,600
I have to heal so many people.

1767
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,220
Oh, it's done.

1768
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:49,860
This is last fight.

1769
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,400
How far are you guys?

1770
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,600
I'm just gonna ult this.

1771
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:56,820
This is last fight.

1772
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:57,660
Yeah, I'm going to backline.

1773
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:01,640
Nice.

1774
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,540
I'm on Mantis.

1775
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,280
Wolverine, Wolverine on point.

1776
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:04,980
Wolverine on point.

1777
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,700
They're gonna have Strange ult too.

1778
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,380
Oh my god.

1779
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,400
Bro, what the fuck?

1780
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,160
I saw that.

1781
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,420
I was like, holy fuck.

1782
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,620
You should have Strange ult and Psylocke ult here.

1783
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:28,940
I think I'm gonna have low gank soon.

1784
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:34,210
I'm scared.

1785
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:36,790
Guys, I don't know.

1786
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:37,790
I want to believe.

1787
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:38,650
Oh, on me, on me, on me.

1788
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,330
I froze somebody.

1789
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:43,710
That's a huge ult.

1790
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:44,530
That's huge, that's huge.

1791
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:46,610
I'm just dead.

1792
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:47,310
I bubble you, bro.

1793
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:49,070
Peel this, peel this and win this.

1794
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,310
How far Mantis is it possible?

1795
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:52,510
Oh, I'm dead.

1796
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,550
And our enemy is held too.

1797
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,310
Guys, kill Hulk.

1798
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:01,490
Leave, leave, leave.

1799
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:03,370
Oh, I'm coming back.

1800
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,390
I'm coming back.

1801
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:10,850
I don't think they didn't use anything for that fight.

1802
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,550
They used Hulk.

1803
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,350
They didn't use Hulk?

1804
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:12,670
Okay.

1805
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,270
Low gank stun on me.

1806
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:21,810
Oh, I'm scared.

1807
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,540
Oh my god.

1808
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,140
Oh, down point, down point.

1809
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:39,320
Wolverine.

1810
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:39,880
Oh, we won.

1811
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:40,480
Wolverine won.

1812
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,400
No, no passive.

1813
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,150
Oh my god.

1814
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,920
I have Wolverine on me.

1815
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,020
Oh, you only have Mantis heals.

1816
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:05,720
Only Mantis heals.

1817
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,300
You don't have points, so you have to stay on point to fight.

1818
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:12,950
Oh no.

1819
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:14,970
Kill their Mantis, kill their Mantis.

1820
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:15,690
Baby, you guys live.

1821
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,550
I have support ult.

1822
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,330
We can live this.

1823
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:22,770
Just don't leave point, don't leave point.

1824
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:23,430
We don't have point.

1825
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:26,130
Alright.

1826
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,310
Alright, I'm putting a show.

1827
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,450
Psylocke here.

1828
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,930
Alright.

1829
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:35,610
Oh.

1830
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,170
Wolverine, Wolverine.

1831
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:39,610
Wolverine.

1832
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:40,550
Wolverine.

1833
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:44,150
She's really slow.

1834
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,870
Oh my god.

1835
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,250
We did it.

1836
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:54,210
Adam and I had the fucking worst time ever.

1837
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,330
Oh my god.

1838
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,450
We were not having a good time.

1839
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,250
See, Adam and I are like...

1840
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,670
I want to die.

1841
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:10,550
Adam and I look at each other and we're just like, here comes the hulk.

1842
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,770
Thank you for the Twitch prize.

1843
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,170
Thank you.

1844
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:18,990
Thank you for the tier one.

1845
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:19,630
Thank you, thank you Clover.

1846
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:20,550
Thank you for the raid.

1847
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:21,810
Thank you, thank you.

1848
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,490
I really appreciate for those who are new here.

1849
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:24,790
My name is Doki Bird.

1850
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:31,090
I usually stream on YouTube, but we're doing the fucking Marvel Rivals ranked time on Twitch.

1851
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,430
Because I don't know how long this is gonna fucking take me.

1852
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:37,110
Oh my god.

1853
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:39,230
Oh my god, bro.

1854
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:42,330
This is why I hate playing against Hulk.

1855
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:46,990
Adam and I are just like, alright, what do we do?

1856
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:52,230
We just look at each other and I'm just like, what do we do, Adam?

1857
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:53,850
Do we just die?

1858
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,150
I...

1859
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:00,710
I guess we die.

1860
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:04,150
Oh my god.

1861
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:06,970
Oh, this is a fucking...

1862
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:09,030
Oh my god, this lobby is...

1863
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:11,030
Holy shit, this is a fucking...

1864
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,350
Oh my god, this is an insane lobby.

1865
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,750
We got Beast, Halo, and Dosu.

1866
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:16,790
We got...

1867
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:18,470
They're really good players.

1868
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,190
We got Overwatch players.

1869
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:24,030
Yeah, this lobby is freaking insane.

1870
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:29,810
This is a dressed up lobby.

1871
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,380
Alright, uh...

1872
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:39,180
Hawkeye.

1873
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,220
Oh, magic?

1874
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:42,720
Okay.

1875
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,660
Maybe they're smarter in their bans than I am.

1876
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:52,160
I just... I do Hawkeye first because, like, fuck, I never want to play against a Hawkeye player.

1877
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,300
Just pray they don't ban Hela.

1878
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,520
They ban Hela, guys.

1879
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,760
Getting a Lord Hela portrait is actually very impressive.

1880
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:05,600
It's incredibly impressive to get a...

1881
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,580
To get a Lord Hela on...

1882
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,840
With, you know, with the society we're in.

1883
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:23,960
Yeah, you can get... I guess you can get it below Diamond, but if you're a really good Hela player...

1884
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,620
You would climb really fast out of Diamond.

1885
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:33,200
Like, you would... You can just climb so fucking fast that you don't need a...

1886
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,960
That it takes even longer.

1887
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:40,750
I'm curious.

1888
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:44,630
I heard they're planning on buffing Storm next season.

1889
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:48,250
Which, I have no idea how they're gonna do it because she's fucking ass.

1890
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:50,190
Like...

1891
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,310
The Doki buy the Battle Pass?

1892
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:52,610
No.

1893
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,950
I will buy the Battle Pass if Marvel Rival sponsors me.

1894
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:57,410
That's my only condition.

1895
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:59,010
I don't ask for much.

1896
01:21:59,110 --> 01:21:59,890
I just want money for it.

1897
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:00,250
What?

1898
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:05,790
I just don't ask for much.

1899
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:08,010
I just want the company to give me money.

1900
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,070
That's all I want.

1901
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:16,370
That's so real for that.

1902
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:24,370
That's not too much to ask for, guys, right?

1903
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:26,130
It's not too much.

1904
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:32,270
Whoa.

1905
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:34,550
Whoa.

1906
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:38,830
Oh, someone says, I have a higher win rate on Mantis than I do on Luna.

1907
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,230
Isn't that crazy?

1908
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:43,310
But yeah, here I am playing Luna.

1909
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:44,870
It's because I play too much Luna.

1910
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:51,970
Where are we?

1911
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:54,490
What the...

1912
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:57,650
How did she die so fast?

1913
01:22:58,570 --> 01:23:00,670
I don't know if I want to be here.

1914
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:06,430
I'm helping our Bucky down here.

1915
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,370
Guys, it was okay.

1916
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:16,550
Guys, I purposely went downstairs to help our Bucky.

1917
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:24,290
I don't know why I always fall off in that area.

1918
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:26,470
I don't know why I keep doing that.

1919
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:28,890
Every time I TP there, every...

1920
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:29,850
I don't know.

1921
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:31,490
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1922
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:33,730
That area is actually my kryptonite.

1923
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:37,270
I cannot deal with that freaking area.

1924
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:41,490
It doesn't happen to me to anywhere else.

1925
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:46,130
It's literally that one section that makes me fall every fucking time.

1926
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:48,910
And I don't know how to fix myself.

1927
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:52,310
I don't know what to do.

1928
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,210
I legitimately don't know what to do.

1929
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:55,470
I just...

1930
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:57,930
It's just every time.

1931
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:04,930
Oh my god, they have a Captain America.

1932
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:05,910
Wait.

1933
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:07,390
Oh, Froze Strange!

1934
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:07,790
Froze Strange!

1935
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:13,130
Oh my god.

1936
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,750
I might need to just pop off here.

1937
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:18,630
I'm ulting here.

1938
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,290
Sweet.

1939
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:20,750
Alright.

1940
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:22,590
I'm pushing back mine.

1941
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:27,650
Do we have anything?

1942
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,130
I'm backing out.

1943
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:34,910
Nice.

1944
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:36,850
Nice leap.

1945
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,460
I'm getting run at by Strange.

1946
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,360
And Captain America.

1947
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,380
Oh, and everything else, I guess.

1948
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:52,480
I'll get run at by everything, I guess.

1949
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:55,300
Alright.

1950
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:57,800
I was like, oh, there's Strange!

1951
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,460
Oh, Captain America too!

1952
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,080
Alright.

1953
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,200
And then Bucky.

1954
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,060
That's fine.

1955
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,380
Again.

1956
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,520
Where's our Syla?

1957
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,520
Oh, there he is.

1958
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:21,720
Alright.

1959
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,640
There he is.

1960
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,740
There he comes.

1961
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,080
Alright.

1962
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:36,720
This is fine.

1963
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,520
I need to top off.

1964
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:43,980
Nice.

1965
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,240
Let's get the walkies.

1966
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,620
I'm bottom of the ground now.

1967
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,260
Strange on me.

1968
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:48,620
Strange.

1969
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:49,160
Strange.

1970
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:49,540
Strange.

1971
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:50,860
Where's... oh.

1972
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:58,870
Oh my god, please.

1973
01:25:59,330 --> 01:25:59,830
I need care.

1974
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:03,450
I'm pushing this.

1975
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:06,470
Yeah, like, I need care.

1976
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:07,090
I'm pushing.

1977
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,470
Oh my god.

1978
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:10,930
Please!

1979
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:12,690
Top, top, top, top, top, top one.

1980
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:14,130
They're portaling in, they're portaling in.

1981
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:15,710
I got owl first, owl first.

1982
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:17,130
Nice.

1983
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:19,990
Oh my god, oh my god.

1984
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:23,010
Oh my god, alright.

1985
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:25,090
They have their support ults here.

1986
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:33,410
Strange is low, strange is low.

1987
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:41,150
Oh, they got both supports.

1988
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:45,010
I didn't have anything.

1989
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,870
That sucked.

1990
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:51,450
We were so close.

1991
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:55,990
We were so close to capping that too.

1992
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:05,370
Oh my god, I didn't have my freeze.

1993
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:07,290
I didn't have my freeze there.

1994
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:12,050
I hate the eye.

1995
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:13,570
I hate it.

1996
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:18,630
It's gonna be difficult, yeah.

1997
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:19,550
It's gonna be difficult.

1998
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:22,650
Some people are like, oh, when season one comes, I'm gonna be just as addicted.

1999
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:23,670
Not in rank.

2000
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:26,730
I only get addicted in rank for the first season.

2001
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:29,210
And then after that, I just check it out casually.

2002
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:34,670
I will play rank ever so often, but I won't be as obsessive as I am right now.

2003
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,470
No, it's true!

2004
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:40,310
It happened for me in Overwatch 2!

2005
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:44,550
I got top 500 in Overwatch 2, and then I stopped caring as much.

2006
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:48,310
I still play it ever so often, but I don't care as much.

2007
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:55,530
But right now, it's also the hit new game right now.

2008
01:27:56,150 --> 01:28:03,210
And everybody's playing it, and I haven't been this competitive in a long fucking time.

2009
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:09,290
So for me, I haven't been so this competitive, so I just wanna play.

2010
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:11,690
I just wanna grind.

2011
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:14,630
I haven't grinded video games like this in a long time.

2012
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:16,550
That's for sure.

2013
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:20,310
It's true!

2014
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:21,370
I haven't!

2015
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:25,010
I haven't grinded rank like this in a long time!

2016
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:26,770
You guys are lucky though.

2017
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:31,030
If you were in my Apex Grand Rank era, I literally disappeared for months.

2018
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:38,330
I wouldn't even tell people I'd be gone.

2019
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:41,990
I'd just disappear when I got my Pred.

2020
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,100
I'm scared.

2021
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:53,780
Oh!

2022
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:58,880
Oh my god!

2023
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,040
What the fuck happened?!

2024
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,000
There's people here left too.

2025
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:03,920
Ground point.

2026
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:05,840
Oh my god!

2027
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,080
I can't!

2028
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,080
What happened?!

2029
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,220
What the fuck?!

2030
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,460
They just died!

2031
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:14,720
Disappeared!

2032
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,180
What the fuck happened?!

2033
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:23,200
They literally just evaporated!

2034
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,880
You don't wanna play inside though, no?

2035
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:30,120
I think we wanna be...

2036
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,720
You know what?

2037
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:32,920
No enemies today.

2038
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:43,680
No enemies today.

2039
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:50,330
That's crazy.

2040
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:52,230
Just today...

2041
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:52,890
Today...

2042
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:54,290
Today there's...

2043
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:56,430
Today we're not gonna...

2044
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:58,150
We're not gonna say anything today.

2045
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:01,530
Bro has no enemies.

2046
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:06,790
That's crazy.

2047
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:14,370
On the seventh day, there were no enemies.

2048
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:16,470
He's just chill like that, guys.

2049
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:17,470
I don't think there was anything...

2050
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:20,190
I don't think I could've done anything to save those guys.

2051
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:22,230
Dude, they were like...

2052
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:24,890
They were like fucking dead.

2053
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:28,610
They were so fucking dead there.

2054
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:32,290
There was nothing I could do to save them.

2055
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:36,130
Like, they literally got...

2056
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:36,850
They hooked two...

2057
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:37,730
Wait, how did they...

2058
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:38,130
Oh, yeah.

2059
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,810
This guy hooked two people into them.

2060
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:42,050
And I was like, what do I do?

2061
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:43,310
I could just...

2062
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:43,870
I clap.

2063
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:50,390
I just clap.

2064
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,460
That's all I can do.

2065
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,600
I clap and hope for the best.

2066
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:09,190
I wanna be Luna.

2067
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:11,650
We have to ban Mantis?

2068
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,130
Oh, we have a Scarlet Witch one trick.

2069
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:16,330
Oh, what the fuck is this?

2070
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:22,270
I...

2071
01:31:25,090 --> 01:31:26,170
I'm just...

2072
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:27,270
What am I...

2073
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:28,310
What is my comp?

2074
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:29,610
Why do...

2075
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:32,970
Why do I have to get both the one tricks?

2076
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:33,540
Why can't...

2077
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:48,630
Why do I have both the one tricks on my team?

2078
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:52,790
Why...

2079
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:53,270
I...

2080
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:55,050
I have both the Scarlet...

2081
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:58,430
Like, I feel like it'd be more fair if one of them moves to the other team.

2082
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,150
I don't know.

2083
01:31:59,390 --> 01:31:59,730
I just...

2084
01:31:59,730 --> 01:32:00,230
Is that...

2085
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:01,730
Is that wrong for me to say?

2086
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,660
It is not...

2087
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:07,820
Oh, do I have compression?

2088
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,300
It's cause the bitrate for Twitch...

2089
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:11,800
I might need...

2090
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,440
I think I just need to play around with my settings, but the maximum bitrate for...

2091
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,300
Oh, okay.

2092
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,080
Wow.

2093
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:18,920
Okay.

2094
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:21,040
Uh...

2095
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:25,920
So, like...

2096
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,000
Because of that, when a lot of activity is going on...

2097
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,620
That's why it gets, like, pixelated.

2098
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:31,480
Because the bitrate...

2099
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,340
Maximum bitrate you can have on Twitch is, like, 6k.

2100
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:37,780
So, like...

2101
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:38,340
I don't know.

2102
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:38,800
I don't know.

2103
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,640
I need to, like, talk to Twitch people to figure out how to fix that.

2104
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,800
Oh, absolutely not.

2105
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:47,700
No, I...

2106
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:48,820
I believe it.

2107
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,160
This game just wants me to suffer.

2108
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:52,280
I believe it.

2109
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,040
I believe it.

2110
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,180
I just need to min-max my stacks.

2111
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,920
I need a DPS player in the stack, too.

2112
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:04,400
That's it.

2113
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:05,860
We got...

2114
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:08,660
It's, like, support, tank, DPS, min-max.

2115
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:10,700
But we...

2116
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,560
Right now, we only adopted a tank player.

2117
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:14,820
Wait, Rocket Raccoon?

2118
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:16,600
Okay, but we banned Mantis, so it's fine.

2119
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:18,020
It's fine.

2120
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,620
We banned Mantis, so it's okay.

2121
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,560
Oh my god, our one-tricks are not playing their one-tricks.

2122
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,640
Oh my god, what a fucking...

2123
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,100
What a time to be alive.

2124
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,320
I remember when everyone thought Rocket Raccoon was good.

2125
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,560
Especially with this map.

2126
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:38,540
Oh my god, okay.

2127
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,720
Oh my god.

2128
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:44,460
I'm scared.

2129
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:48,980
I'm scared.

2130
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,300
I have fly in four seconds.

2131
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,280
Oh my god.

2132
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,720
We were walled off, Strange.

2133
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:11,700
Strange Nation is never walled off.

2134
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,320
Oh, you're walled off again.

2135
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,400
Fuck, I might be walled off.

2136
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:17,860
Our Raccoon needs help.

2137
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:18,200
Oh.

2138
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,180
There's a Hawkeye in main.

2139
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:30,940
Guys, I'm fucking dead.

2140
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:33,560
Raccoon, please, you see?

2141
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,680
Okay, okay.

2142
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:50,830
Poor, poor little guy.

2143
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:52,570
Poor little guy.

2144
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:55,310
He deserves it.

2145
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:57,530
Just call it when you want it.

2146
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:59,410
I don't think he uses comms.

2147
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:03,290
How do you call when the Raccoon and...

2148
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:05,170
Can you top me off real quick?

2149
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:10,030
I don't know if I should...

2150
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:11,270
No, they have Strange over here.

2151
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:14,570
I'm ulting this.

2152
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:18,890
Alright, live!

2153
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:22,010
Live!

2154
01:35:23,490 --> 01:35:24,450
I have my ult out for this.

2155
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:25,370
Strange has ult as well.

2156
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:26,170
Alright.

2157
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:29,350
I froze Groot.

2158
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:34,550
You know, I thought they would take, you know...

2159
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:38,410
I legitimately thought they were going to take more damage, so I did the clap, but...

2160
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:39,470
Oh, Groot is half.

2161
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:44,970
Oh, nice.

2162
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:46,130
I don't think we need any ults left.

2163
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:48,930
We don't need ult anymore.

2164
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:50,390
Wait, are they running?

2165
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:50,850
Okay, no.

2166
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:51,450
They still have Tripp.

2167
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:53,530
They should have Hawkeye and Strange ult here.

2168
01:35:58,180 --> 01:35:58,700
Alright.

2169
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:00,060
It's fine.

2170
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:03,020
I have a 30% win rate on Cloak and Dagger.

2171
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:07,880
It's not something to brag about, but you cannot put me on her.

2172
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:18,740
For the sake of our team, I should never be allowed to touch Cloak and Dagger.

2173
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,420
I don't even think it's me!

2174
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,640
I just think I'm put in unwinnable situations.

2175
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:31,340
When I'm playing Cloak and Dagger, it's just literally just unwinnable.

2176
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,480
Like, we're even right now.

2177
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:37,340
Oh, nevermind.

2178
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:43,620
I can't see you.

2179
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:46,780
Alright.

2180
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:52,000
I mean, at least it isn't zero, right?

2181
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:52,580
Yeah, right.

2182
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,000
At least it is zero!

2183
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,640
They have Stranger as well.

2184
01:36:59,140 --> 01:36:59,820
Strangers have.

2185
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,140
Oh, get in my ult, get in my ult, Penny!

2186
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:10,420
Oh my god.

2187
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,640
Alright, I'm backing up.

2188
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,460
Oh my god.

2189
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,460
Oh!

2190
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,420
I keep forgetting this pull.

2191
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,560
I keep forgetting that pull exists sometimes.

2192
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:32,100
Oh, he's E'd.

2193
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:37,100
I'm like, use your Z!

2194
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:38,160
Woo!

2195
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:42,680
I'm serious!

2196
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,200
I was at the end!

2197
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,100
Every time!

2198
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,480
Every fucking time.

2199
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,220
I got caught in the corner.

2200
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,900
It was a really good whale ult though, to be fair.

2201
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,080
I'm fucking leaving.

2202
01:37:58,860 --> 01:37:59,640
I leave.

2203
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:00,700
Goodbye.

2204
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:03,720
You can have my orb, Wolverine.

2205
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:05,940
I leave.

2206
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:09,820
Why did you just walk away?

2207
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,580
God, I wish... man.

2208
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:17,020
I wish I could just walk away.

2209
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:20,320
I don't understand!

2210
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:21,860
I was in the corner!

2211
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,820
Like, I feel like when you're at the edge, you're supposed to take less damage.

2212
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:29,840
I don't know, maybe I'm fucking crazy when I'm in that.

2213
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:31,940
Maybe.

2214
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:37,920
Maybe I'm just dumb for thinking that that's the...

2215
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,160
I won.

2216
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,720
Like, five people have one health left.

2217
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:41,740
I walk.

2218
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,980
I can't see you.

2219
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:49,560
I see you, I see you for heals.

2220
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:51,140
I'd reload.

2221
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,740
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

2222
01:38:56,540 --> 01:39:03,380
I don't wanna die to the... I don't wanna die to the fucking Hawkeye, so I'm fucking... I'm trying to...

2223
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,100
Let's not die to the Hawkeye ult!

2224
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,800
He has strange ult.

2225
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:10,860
He's dead.

2226
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:11,600
I won.

2227
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:13,980
Jesus Christ.

2228
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,220
I don't think I have it yet.

2229
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,340
Should I use it?

2230
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:18,760
I have to reload, you can heal.

2231
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:25,420
Jesus Christ, you guys are all taking a million damage!

2232
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,160
Is she ulting you?

2233
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,440
Oh.

2234
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,000
Strange.

2235
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,460
Listen to the mic, mic, mic.

2236
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:40,220
Jesus... Oh my god!

2237
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,200
He fucking exploded!

2238
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,520
And he's looking for the ult.

2239
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,560
Oh, I got hit, I got hit!

2240
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:51,860
It's fine.

2241
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:52,840
I went strange.

2242
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:54,900
Oh my god!

2243
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:55,800
He's one, he's one.

2244
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,500
He's one, he's one.

2245
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:58,120
No more slow to.

2246
01:39:58,700 --> 01:39:59,640
He's one, he's one.

2247
01:39:59,740 --> 01:39:59,880
He's one, he's one, please.

2248
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,700
He's one, please guys, turn around.

2249
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,000
Strange!

2250
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:05,240
Is he one?

2251
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,180
Is he still one?

2252
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:14,040
I'm pushing this, I'm pushing this.

2253
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,480
Guys, I want to know, is he still one?

2254
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:17,580
Guys?

2255
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:21,300
Strange, strange, strange, strange.

2256
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,980
Is he still one, guys?

2257
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,040
Shut the hulk down.

2258
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,860
There's uh, no more to our left.

2259
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:39,720
Oh my god.

2260
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:40,880
I got them all.

2261
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:44,840
Oh my god, nice.

2262
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:48,360
You're so healthy.

2263
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,560
I swear to...

2264
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,200
Get the turret!

2265
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:52,860
I'm alive.

2266
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,540
That's all that matters.

2267
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:56,700
I did it, guys.

2268
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,300
I dodged the fucking no more ult.

2269
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,520
Guys, are you proud of me?

2270
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,580
I fucking did it.

2271
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:03,100
I...

2272
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:07,660
I fucking...

2273
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:08,720
I did it.

2274
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:11,840
We're so proud, right here.

2275
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:15,680
Did he do it?

2276
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:20,050
Oh my god.

2277
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:20,990
There's a hulk at main.

2278
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:22,810
I'm ulting this.

2279
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:26,110
Oh, they see nine.

2280
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:30,610
Point out that your ult does a lot more damage if you're full range, bro.

2281
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:31,350
Oh, really?

2282
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:31,950
I didn't know that.

2283
01:41:32,230 --> 01:41:32,470
Yeah.

2284
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:35,290
Guys, I did it.

2285
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:37,110
I walked to the left, guys.

2286
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:41,190
I fucking...

2287
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:42,290
I did it.

2288
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:43,610
I walked to the left.

2289
01:41:49,130 --> 01:41:51,890
That's called character development right there.

2290
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:54,990
I'm gonna admit though, today's not like my best day.

2291
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:59,350
I'm gonna admit, today's definitely not my best day.

2292
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:01,530
My best gaming day.

2293
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:02,390
I can feel it.

2294
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:12,790
We did pretty good at kidnapping them, though.

2295
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:14,550
Oh, we're doing good.

2296
01:42:14,610 --> 01:42:15,430
Thank you, guys.

2297
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:17,630
Thank you for echo chambering me.

2298
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:18,510
We?

2299
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:20,270
No!

2300
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:22,590
Okay, fat nojoki.

2301
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,410
Find that guy out.

2302
01:42:24,690 --> 01:42:26,510
You're supposed to be like, no, doki.

2303
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:27,630
You're doing great.

2304
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:28,690
I didn't even notice.

2305
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:30,850
You're supposed to gas me up.

2306
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:33,270
I'm just gonna take him back to your portal.

2307
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,770
Alright, we should defight.

2308
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:42,710
That's right, it was a trap all along.

2309
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,190
That's fucking right.

2310
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:46,830
I was gonna trap you.

2311
01:42:56,470 --> 01:43:00,310
I'm gonna put down a tank, just because I don't trust...

2312
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:02,650
Can you bubble me?

2313
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:03,130
Nice.

2314
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:04,310
I can feed right side.

2315
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:04,690
Come right.

2316
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:11,390
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, but I'm a little scared.

2317
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:14,610
I'm a little scared about this position.

2318
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:17,890
Oh my god!

2319
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:20,010
What do I look at?

2320
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:21,370
You're down a healer.

2321
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:26,310
What do I look at?

2322
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:29,070
I feel so trapped.

2323
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:35,010
Holy shit, I felt so trapped there.

2324
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:37,790
I have no shield.

2325
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:41,270
You're LOSing me right now.

2326
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:51,750
Yeah, they're...

2327
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:55,330
Tank, tank, tank, tank, tank.

2328
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:57,870
Oh my god, I wish that were me though.

2329
01:43:58,490 --> 01:43:59,530
Who was that for?

2330
01:44:00,510 --> 01:44:01,570
That looked targeted.

2331
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:03,450
That actually looked so targeted.

2332
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:04,430
Not gonna lie.

2333
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:08,770
That looked incredibly targeted.

2334
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:10,470
That was so close to me.

2335
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:16,390
Oh god, to the left.

2336
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:17,830
He's half.

2337
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:24,730
Oh, I didn't even notice that guy was there.

2338
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:26,590
I literally...

2339
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:28,250
I have ult so you can heal, Cloak.

2340
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,460
You can go up, I have ult.

2341
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,580
Alright, he ain't...

2342
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:41,000
Okay, I didn't even think God it wasn't directed at me.

2343
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:41,440
I was...

2344
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,700
I was a little worried there.

2345
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,140
I thought it was...

2346
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:47,140
I was like, after everything I went through.

2347
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:51,740
Yeah, I just want our Cloak to get support ult.

2348
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,860
Cause I already have mine, so there's no use for me to push up.

2349
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:57,620
That's Overwatch trap, baby.

2350
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:02,240
What the fuck hit me?

2351
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,060
Strange one, strange one.

2352
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,100
Strange one, strange one.

2353
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:10,840
You got this, bro.

2354
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,380
Is this winnable?

2355
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:17,000
Should I ult?

2356
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:18,200
No, nevermind.

2357
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,880
If they push up a bit, I'll ult it.

2358
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:24,560
Oh, nevermind.

2359
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,100
I'm back.

2360
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:33,360
Okay, that's fine.

2361
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:37,420
It's alright.

2362
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:39,940
I need a little top off, please.

2363
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,580
Please top me off, please top me off.

2364
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:45,540
We're fucking worthy.

2365
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:46,920
I'm ulting this in.

2366
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:48,280
Just for us.

2367
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:50,480
Alright.

2368
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:52,660
We should have Strange ult, though.

2369
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:59,580
Oh, my ult's over.

2370
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:03,680
I'm a little scared.

2371
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:07,100
Strange half, strange low, strange one, strange one.

2372
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:14,120
Oh, he's doing it, he's doing it.

2373
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:17,220
My god, you did it.

2374
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:19,060
Thanks, bro.

2375
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,260
Oh, my god.

2376
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,160
He grew up.

2377
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:27,300
Yeah, it might be.

2378
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,320
No, nevermind, they swapped.

2379
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:29,860
No strange.

2380
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,040
What are they doing?

2381
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:33,680
Oh, they're doing DPS.

2382
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:35,100
Oh, my god.

2383
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,240
He actually grew up.

2384
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:40,640
We watched his character grow.

2385
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,820
I learned how to walk left and he learned how to wolverine ult.

2386
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:45,560
That's fucking crazy.

2387
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,640
Push, push, push, push, push.

2388
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:50,600
Push, push, push.

2389
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,440
Alright.

2390
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:54,360
There's no way he hits me there.

2391
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:54,560
Yeah.

2392
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,520
We can win this, we can win this.

2393
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,640
I'm really low, though.

2394
01:46:58,780 --> 01:46:59,680
Oh, that's fine.

2395
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:04,320
Magneto, one.

2396
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:05,260
Or half.

2397
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:06,620
I got him.

2398
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,560
Oh, I can't, though.

2399
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:09,140
I got stunned.

2400
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:10,900
Nice kill, nice kill.

2401
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:11,420
Can you live?

2402
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:11,980
Live, live, live.

2403
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,340
Back, back, back, back, back.

2404
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:15,920
Give me heals.

2405
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:17,180
Give me heals.

2406
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:23,360
Okay, I'm really ulting for you.

2407
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:25,360
Go, go, go, go, go.

2408
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:27,440
Alright.

2409
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:32,320
Oh, sorry, I can't save you from a headshot.

2410
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:37,060
Oh, goodbye.

2411
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:39,410
He got headshot.

2412
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,600
I was like, sorry, buddy.

2413
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:48,510
My heals are great.

2414
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,580
But, bro, I...

2415
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,260
Guys, that's a headshot right there.

2416
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,060
That's rough.

2417
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:03,640
I'm not peeking.

2418
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,380
Holy fuck.

2419
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,580
This is why we ban Hawkeye, everybody.

2420
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:18,640
This is exactly why we ban Hawkeye.

2421
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,260
There's a Star Lord to your left.

2422
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,200
Star Lord behind us.

2423
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:35,090
Nice kill.

2424
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:36,330
Oh my god.

2425
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:38,710
Star Lord's still behind us.

2426
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:41,990
Can't do anything about it.

2427
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:42,510
No!

2428
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:44,230
I'm dead.

2429
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:47,610
You have no supports.

2430
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:55,340
Remember when I said there's a Sturzy?

2431
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:56,560
Just use it.

2432
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,300
You're a Magneto.

2433
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:03,340
Face a lot.

2434
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,140
I need heals too.

2435
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,180
I need heals as well.

2436
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:18,600
That's awkward.

2437
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,560
That's awkward.

2438
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,700
I need a top off.

2439
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,840
Oh my god, I need a focus now.

2440
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:33,800
Shoot the Star Lord.

2441
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,600
He's not missing.

2442
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:43,680
Help our Punisher, Reds.

2443
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:46,460
I can't see you, Punisher.

2444
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:47,620
He's one.

2445
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:49,740
Nice, I'm pushing in.

2446
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:50,620
Watch out.

2447
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:54,780
This is his last fight.

2448
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:00,640
How do you reload?

2449
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:05,610
Got him.

2450
01:50:07,730 --> 01:50:08,630
I forced Squirtle.

2451
01:50:09,470 --> 01:50:10,410
If we live, we win this.

2452
01:50:11,390 --> 01:50:12,550
Watch out the Hawkeye one-shot.

2453
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:13,890
Right side, right side, watch out.

2454
01:50:14,610 --> 01:50:15,810
I'm not peeking this.

2455
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:17,390
You're welcome to Luna ult now.

2456
01:50:17,870 --> 01:50:18,650
Yeah, I can ult now.

2457
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:19,710
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

2458
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:21,450
Go, go, go, go, go.

2459
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:22,330
Go, go, go, go.

2460
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:22,710
The backline.

2461
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:23,270
Luna ult.

2462
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:24,230
Nice.

2463
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:26,030
Nice, nice.

2464
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:28,490
There's a Squirtle girl to our left.

2465
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:29,190
Squirtle girl to our left.

2466
01:50:29,870 --> 01:50:31,270
And Magneto to our behind us.

2467
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:32,830
Magneto and Cloak behind.

2468
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:38,610
Cloak, Cloak, Cloak, Cloak.

2469
01:50:38,610 --> 01:50:39,010
Cloak half.

2470
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:39,510
Cloak one.

2471
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:40,750
Cloak one.

2472
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:41,910
Cloak one.

2473
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:42,750
This guy.

2474
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:47,470
I'm backing out from cart so I can heal.

2475
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:50,470
Oh my god.

2476
01:50:54,410 --> 01:50:55,410
Thank god.

2477
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:56,130
Thank god.

2478
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:56,890
Thank god we beat a mutant.

2479
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:57,930
Thank god.

2480
01:50:58,110 --> 01:50:58,970
Thank god.

2481
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:02,010
That's right.

2482
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:03,850
I didn't change my viewpoint.

2483
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:08,610
That's right.

2484
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:10,370
Not again.

2485
01:51:13,230 --> 01:51:16,450
No, I'll never change it.

2486
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,170
What do you mean?

2487
01:51:21,170 --> 01:51:23,670
What do you mean a non-mutant helped us?

2488
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:26,190
I don't see no mutant being MVP.

2489
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:29,570
Luna's my one exception.

2490
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:38,770
She's my one.

2491
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:41,790
Damn you Doki Striker.

2492
01:51:42,210 --> 01:51:43,970
She's one of the good mutants.

2493
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:46,490
Eddboi, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2494
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:47,410
Thank you, thank you.

2495
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:50,190
Trusty Blue Nose, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2496
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:51,870
And Herbalist, thank you for the Tier 1 sub.

2497
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:52,650
Thank you, thank you.

2498
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:55,410
I need 60 points to be on the leaderboard.

2499
01:51:55,770 --> 01:52:01,990
But I think 250 is like the cutoff for it by the end of the season.

2500
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:05,050
That's messed up.

2501
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:07,710
What are you, a war criminal like Professor Xavier?

2502
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:20,390
I bet you endorse a war criminal.

2503
01:52:24,850 --> 01:52:28,070
That's right, I'm anti-mutant.

2504
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,730
Not this shit again.

2505
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:34,430
It's true.

2506
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:42,550
GamePig, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2507
01:52:42,650 --> 01:52:43,830
Thank you, thank you.

2508
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,810
I just think it's weird.

2509
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:54,630
He's literally using children as soldiers.

2510
01:52:55,130 --> 01:52:57,030
Is that not fucking weird?

2511
01:52:57,030 --> 01:52:59,310
Is that...

2512
01:53:00,570 --> 01:53:05,070
We need to investigate Professor Xavier and shut down his school.

2513
01:53:05,470 --> 01:53:06,310
We need to...

2514
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:07,950
That's true.

2515
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:09,030
Wait, hold up.

2516
01:53:09,310 --> 01:53:11,350
Wait, she's cooking right now.

2517
01:53:11,530 --> 01:53:12,410
Hold on.

2518
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:17,010
The children yearn for war.

2519
01:53:20,030 --> 01:53:22,450
Does Logan even have a degree?

2520
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:25,110
Why is he teaching children?

2521
01:53:25,770 --> 01:53:27,010
Does he even have a fucking degree?

2522
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:29,730
Does he even have a PhD?

2523
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:37,490
He still needs a teaching degree to be of any sort of teaching.

2524
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:44,860
Logan doesn't teach.

2525
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,080
Also, is he even in American League?

2526
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:53,320
All I'm saying is he's Canadian.

2527
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:55,140
He's not even American.

2528
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:57,660
He's not even American.

2529
01:53:57,820 --> 01:53:58,470
He's Canadian.

2530
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:01,600
How did he get to America?

2531
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:03,800
No!

2532
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:09,540
He escaped Canada.

2533
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,640
Fucking fought multiple American wars.

2534
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,480
Wait, does he actually teach?

2535
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:27,640
Does he actually have a teaching license?

2536
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:31,480
No, I know he's an art teacher, but does he actually?

2537
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,820
I just like thinking he went to...

2538
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:39,580
He's just going to school just so he can get a teaching license.

2539
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:47,740
He's just going to fuck.

2540
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:50,280
He has to go to university to get a teaching license.

2541
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,380
Alright, we're fine.

2542
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:57,260
We're so fine.

2543
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:57,800
Wait, what?

2544
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:00,680
Oh, okay.

2545
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,180
Oh, I think he knows my 30% win rate on cloak and dagger.

2546
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:07,140
I think...

2547
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:12,560
I think he knows.

2548
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:16,460
My Adam's not even that bad!

2549
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:18,100
I swear to God.

2550
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,860
My Adam's not even that bad.

2551
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:22,840
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

2552
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:23,740
Got it?

2553
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:27,840
He's so... I didn't even fucking touch cloak!

2554
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,200
Wait, where's the TP?

2555
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:41,700
Bro, I can't... I hate the clutter on this specific area though.

2556
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:44,640
This specific area?

2557
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:45,560
Oh my God.

2558
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:48,990
We can't... Oh, there's a strange sleeping...

2559
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:52,390
Oh my God, I can't see!

2560
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:57,910
I hate this area in general.

2561
01:55:58,090 --> 01:55:59,130
It's so hard to see.

2562
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:02,470
I cannot see there.

2563
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:07,070
Oh,

2564
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:12,090
well, goodbye.

2565
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:20,370
He'll be fine.

2566
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:21,010
Here.

2567
01:56:22,010 --> 01:56:23,350
He'll be so healthy.

2568
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:24,770
See?

2569
01:56:25,090 --> 01:56:26,350
He's so healthy.

2570
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:29,390
Look at how healthy he is.

2571
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:32,870
I... Okay, look at how healthy he is.

2572
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:36,870
He's so healthy!

2573
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:39,330
Look at him go!

2574
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:44,350
It's so scary.

2575
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:48,830
With this amount of heals, it's so scary.

2576
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:51,950
It's like, you don't have that much heals in general.

2577
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:55,350
Where's Hulk?

2578
01:56:58,730 --> 01:56:59,230
Oh!

2579
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:03,710
Anyway, well...

2580
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:04,350
I got him!

2581
01:57:05,870 --> 01:57:06,510
Hulk out!

2582
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:06,890
Hulk out!

2583
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:08,390
Kael'thas?

2584
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:12,210
Oh, strange one!

2585
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:12,610
Strange one!

2586
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:18,830
Alright, nice.

2587
01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:20,510
Nice!

2588
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:21,710
We did it!

2589
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:24,110
Yippee!

2590
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:35,330
I hate playing... At least, like, I'm on Mantis so, like, I don't have to worry too much about, like, getting ran at by Hulk.

2591
01:57:35,870 --> 01:57:37,990
Because, like, at least I have...

2592
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:42,490
God, I'm not... I need to, like, get used to Mantis Projectile.

2593
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:43,750
At least I have Sleep.

2594
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:49,570
I mean, to be fair, I have Freeze too, but Sleep has a... Feels like... Feels like people don't fucking wake people up.

2595
01:57:53,470 --> 01:57:53,930
Oh!

2596
01:57:56,070 --> 01:57:59,810
Oh, sorry, Bob!

2597
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:01,390
Sorry.

2598
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:03,970
I'm trying to help you.

2599
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:04,930
I don't have leaves anymore.

2600
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:12,370
Oh my god, I had no leaves!

2601
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:16,210
I had no leaves and I was freaking out!

2602
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:18,270
I'm gonna grab TP.

2603
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:18,850
I'm gonna TP.

2604
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:21,990
No, Mantis does not hit Scan.

2605
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:22,770
She's Projectile.

2606
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:27,670
That's why I hate, um... Her aim fucks me up sometimes.

2607
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:28,790
Because of it.

2608
01:58:30,430 --> 01:58:31,370
Oh my god, where did he go?

2609
01:58:33,790 --> 01:58:35,030
Where did he go?

2610
01:58:35,690 --> 01:58:36,050
He's one.

2611
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:36,430
He's one.

2612
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:38,070
I remember one health!

2613
01:58:38,170 --> 01:58:38,350
One health!

2614
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:40,970
Oh my god.

2615
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:42,890
I should've killed him.

2616
01:58:43,770 --> 01:58:44,370
He's one, I guess.

2617
01:58:45,970 --> 01:58:46,810
Train is half.

2618
01:58:47,030 --> 01:58:48,890
I have a... I have a Hulk on me.

2619
01:58:50,850 --> 01:58:51,970
I'm 97 on ult.

2620
01:58:52,070 --> 01:58:52,350
I'm 97.

2621
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:52,710
I have it.

2622
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:52,950
I have it.

2623
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:55,690
I'm on Hulk.

2624
01:58:56,310 --> 01:58:56,910
Hulk one.

2625
01:58:58,850 --> 01:58:59,490
Hulk is low.

2626
01:58:59,530 --> 01:58:59,890
Hulk is low.

2627
01:59:03,450 --> 01:59:04,270
Alright, nice.

2628
01:59:05,150 --> 01:59:05,970
Oh my god!

2629
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:07,930
I got ult just in time.

2630
01:59:11,150 --> 01:59:12,350
That's a hateful aim.

2631
01:59:12,350 --> 01:59:14,430
That is huge.

2632
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:20,070
You should have Starlord ult here.

2633
01:59:26,970 --> 01:59:27,970
There we go.

2634
01:59:28,190 --> 01:59:28,750
I'm on Mantis.

2635
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:29,750
Mantis low.

2636
01:59:31,730 --> 01:59:32,390
Mantis one.

2637
01:59:32,570 --> 01:59:32,810
Mantis one.

2638
01:59:36,610 --> 01:59:37,590
Ironman low.

2639
01:59:38,210 --> 01:59:39,010
Ironman low.

2640
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:40,230
Oh, Ironman one.

2641
01:59:41,070 --> 01:59:42,450
Oh my god, please!

2642
01:59:43,950 --> 01:59:44,910
I believe in you.

2643
01:59:44,910 --> 01:59:48,090
There's a Hulk that's like sleeping in the back.

2644
01:59:49,630 --> 01:59:50,170
Hulk one.

2645
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:50,570
Hulk one.

2646
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:53,530
Oh, goodbye.

2647
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:55,050
I have gamma.

2648
01:59:55,190 --> 01:59:55,290
I have gamma.

2649
01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:55,490
Chill.

2650
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:55,690
Chill.

2651
01:59:55,810 --> 01:59:55,970
Chill.

2652
01:59:56,110 --> 01:59:56,230
Chill.

2653
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:56,850
No, it's fine.

2654
02:00:02,630 --> 02:00:04,290
That poor Ironman.

2655
02:00:06,650 --> 02:00:07,450
Holy shit.

2656
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:10,490
I just saw the Ironman and just...

2657
02:00:10,490 --> 02:00:11,470
Oh my god.

2658
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:13,290
The poor guy.

2659
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:16,630
He actually fucking went in.

2660
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:20,330
What was that?

2661
02:00:20,390 --> 02:00:21,170
Who was that leader?

2662
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:23,450
Of the anti-mutant person?

2663
02:00:25,070 --> 02:00:26,110
Something striker?

2664
02:00:29,170 --> 02:00:30,390
Yeah, no.

2665
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:33,350
I'm taking it too far.

2666
02:00:33,630 --> 02:00:34,430
Striker.

2667
02:00:34,430 --> 02:00:34,890
Striker.

2668
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:38,250
It called me dookie striker.

2669
02:00:39,250 --> 02:00:42,430
I think she's called me dookie striker.

2670
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:47,430
Okay, striker.

2671
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:53,590
A new costume idea.

2672
02:00:57,090 --> 02:00:58,990
Wait, I'm striker.

2673
02:00:59,430 --> 02:01:00,050
Alright.

2674
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:02,950
Oh, do your thing.

2675
02:01:05,070 --> 02:01:06,490
Oh, do your thing.

2676
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,240
I wonder if jumping affects...

2677
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:23,640
Because I normally don't jump because I got trained to not jump in Apex.

2678
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:26,780
But I don't know if it's actually helpful to jump.

2679
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:29,320
That's the thing.

2680
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:30,100
I don't know.

2681
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:33,500
Because I see so many people... I don't know.

2682
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:34,520
I'm on strange.

2683
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:35,260
Strange is half.

2684
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:35,840
Strange is low.

2685
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:42,280
Oh god.

2686
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:45,400
I don't know.

2687
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:47,640
I have no idea if jumping is bad or not.

2688
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,200
Because in Apex, it's so bad.

2689
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:53,860
Because it makes you super predictable.

2690
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,200
I can't see you, Iron Man.

2691
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:03,760
I might counter ult this.

2692
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:06,560
I can't see you.

2693
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,580
Oh, nevermind.

2694
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,340
Iron Man just walked into me.

2695
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,260
Yeah, that was my bad.

2696
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:23,180
That's why I don't know.

2697
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:24,780
I don't know if jumping is good for...

2698
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:29,100
Because I used to jump in Overwatch.

2699
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:31,980
So I don't know if it's actually good to jump.

2700
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:33,260
Or not.

2701
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:40,910
Yo, strange is right here.

2702
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:42,790
He's looking for ult.

2703
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:48,520
Strange, strange, strange, strange.

2704
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:54,020
I slept the... Hulk.

2705
02:02:55,420 --> 02:02:55,760
I'm ulting.

2706
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:57,400
Oh, he froze me.

2707
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:05,700
Where are people?

2708
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:07,340
I'm so confused.

2709
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,720
It's so cluttered.

2710
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,900
I meant as a support.

2711
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:22,880
Because as a squishy, I can't tell if you're squishy if it's good or not.

2712
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,300
I'm not gonna look at that yet.

2713
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:29,320
I slept the Mantis.

2714
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:32,880
Mantis is half.

2715
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:33,700
Iron Man is half too.

2716
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:37,840
Okay, I'm getting shot at by Hulk.

2717
02:03:38,860 --> 02:03:39,580
Hulk is on me.

2718
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:42,000
Hulk is low.

2719
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:42,820
Army Hulk is low.

2720
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:46,840
Oh my god.

2721
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:50,400
No, I don't have leap for you.

2722
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:52,020
Hulk one.

2723
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:08,220
I'm a little scared.

2724
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:09,560
Are they portals?

2725
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:11,640
They're all through it.

2726
02:04:15,410 --> 02:04:16,330
I'm ulting this.

2727
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:18,690
Stay with me.

2728
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:20,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

2729
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:21,250
I have gamma.

2730
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:23,990
I'm damage boosting you.

2731
02:04:25,630 --> 02:04:27,030
Strange one, strange one, strange one.

2732
02:04:27,910 --> 02:04:28,430
He's low.

2733
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:32,770
I'm on lowkey.

2734
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:33,530
Lowkey half.

2735
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:34,890
Oh,

2736
02:04:38,350 --> 02:04:39,370
there's an Amora at the top.

2737
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:44,560
Nice.

2738
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:45,040
Okay.

2739
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:50,000
Oh, they swapped a cloak.

2740
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:53,960
We have no supports.

2741
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:55,480
We're both coming back now.

2742
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:05,240
Strange one, strange one.

2743
02:05:11,140 --> 02:05:14,080
Boomer, I got you Boomer.

2744
02:05:15,610 --> 02:05:16,780
Thank you.

2745
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:17,760
Amora at half.

2746
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:18,740
No.

2747
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:24,640
I got an Amora.

2748
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:30,960
Wait, I can.

2749
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,000
It's time.

2750
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:36,040
It's time.

2751
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,360
I'm going as fast as I can.

2752
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:40,840
It's time.

2753
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:43,300
This will be game changer.

2754
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:46,560
This will be game...

2755
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:54,900
I'm trying.

2756
02:05:57,180 --> 02:05:58,180
I'm on strange, strange half.

2757
02:05:58,540 --> 02:05:59,300
Strange one, strange one.

2758
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,320
Strange actually one.

2759
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:09,040
Get Jeffed.

2760
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:12,740
It worked.

2761
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:15,620
The Jeffswapped worked.

2762
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:20,020
I had to start spitting.

2763
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:24,280
I knew it.

2764
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:25,920
I knew the Jeff would work.

2765
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:27,780
I knew it.

2766
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:34,520
I started spitting.

2767
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:37,220
I figured it was the way to go.

2768
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:46,120
Because, you know, I thought that Mantis doesn't give enough heals for the last fight.

2769
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:48,980
Because all I can do is just throw leaves.

2770
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:50,380
And I only have four leaves.

2771
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:52,780
So I was like, it's time to start spitting.

2772
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:56,800
Usually you got Jeffed at the last fight.

2773
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:00,860
If you're the last support to die, you have to swap to Jeff so you can get back faster.

2774
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:02,960
I mean, to be fair, Mantis gets back faster too.

2775
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:05,900
But then Jeff gives more heal output for the last fight.

2776
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:08,260
Also Archive, thank you for tier one!

2777
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:09,560
And Omni, thank you for tier one!

2778
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:10,680
So thank you!

2779
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:20,740
We're like, we've been playing with the same people.

2780
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:22,540
Is this the EastieQs?

2781
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:26,400
Is this what it's like to be in the EastieQs?

2782
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,460
You just play with like...

2783
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:33,560
You just play with these same people over and over again.

2784
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,640
Yeah, Luna was banned.

2785
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:38,680
That's why I was on Mantis.

2786
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:40,300
She was banned.

2787
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,880
My 54% win rate with Luna.

2788
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:49,020
It's because I play a lot of games on Luna.

2789
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:51,180
That's really it.

2790
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:56,960
I just have so many games played, guys.

2791
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:04,360
Yikes.

2792
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:05,040
Silo?

2793
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:06,140
Okay.

2794
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:09,520
I have a 64% win rate on Mantis.

2795
02:08:10,940 --> 02:08:12,160
Hey, I'm good with that, ban Silo.

2796
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:13,420
Okay, whatever.

2797
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:14,100
Everyone pick it.

2798
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:14,880
I already picked Taka.

2799
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:15,680
I don't fucking care.

2800
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:16,620
I don't give a damn.

2801
02:08:17,060 --> 02:08:18,660
Doki Nation, we need your vote.

2802
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:19,520
For what?

2803
02:08:19,700 --> 02:08:20,080
Silo?

2804
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,420
Whatever your heart desires.

2805
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:22,160
Alright.

2806
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:23,600
Thank god.

2807
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:24,060
Awesome!

2808
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:26,180
My win rate?

2809
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:26,960
No, I'm not.

2810
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:28,760
I get into some crazy loss streaks.

2811
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:33,500
I would get like really good win streaks and then some fucking crazy loss streaks.

2812
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:40,860
Are we attack or defense first?

2813
02:08:44,370 --> 02:08:45,610
Like, we've been there.

2814
02:08:45,690 --> 02:08:46,610
We've all been there.

2815
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:49,750
It's really...

2816
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:51,290
It do be like that.

2817
02:08:52,450 --> 02:08:55,390
It's the GM era where I struggle the most.

2818
02:08:56,070 --> 02:09:00,670
I think GM was where I like actually was not great.

2819
02:09:00,770 --> 02:09:02,310
It was not like feeling it.

2820
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:12,650
During the GM era, I was not... I was not feeling it.

2821
02:09:12,770 --> 02:09:15,710
I was back and forth for the longest time.

2822
02:09:16,610 --> 02:09:24,110
I would be like GM... I would jump from GM1 to GM2 to GM3 to GM2 to GM1 to GM2.

2823
02:09:24,690 --> 02:09:27,830
And then finally I got to Eternity and it's...

2824
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:33,310
Every time I get to a new rank, I get to stay there for a little bit.

2825
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:35,550
I will respect you.

2826
02:09:36,030 --> 02:09:38,590
GM was like my purgatory.

2827
02:09:41,630 --> 02:09:45,050
It was my fucking purgatory of hell.

2828
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:50,890
Wait, we're solo tanking.

2829
02:09:50,990 --> 02:09:51,690
I just realized.

2830
02:09:54,470 --> 02:09:56,770
I just realized we're solo tanking.

2831
02:09:56,970 --> 02:09:58,470
Jesus Christ.

2832
02:09:58,650 --> 02:09:59,450
Okay, I need to clap.

2833
02:09:59,910 --> 02:10:00,790
I'm gonna start clapping.

2834
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:03,650
There's a lot of damage being taken right now.

2835
02:10:03,710 --> 02:10:05,170
Oh, that's...

2836
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:08,190
Oh my god.

2837
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:08,910
I need to reload.

2838
02:10:09,710 --> 02:10:10,510
I can't help you.

2839
02:10:10,650 --> 02:10:13,510
No, nobody was taking damage.

2840
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,160
Change one, change one.

2841
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:22,020
There's a Punisher top left.

2842
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:23,760
We need to get him.

2843
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:25,220
It's a Bucky now.

2844
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:26,580
Oh yeah, sorry Bucky.

2845
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:29,380
Okay, these kids don't know how to play against Black Panther.

2846
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:31,240
I'm telling you, every time I dodge them, they're...

2847
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:33,500
Stay alive, stay alive.

2848
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:34,280
We win, we win.

2849
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,920
3, 2, 1.

2850
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:40,260
You kidding that?

2851
02:10:40,380 --> 02:10:41,460
Magno, right side.

2852
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:48,420
We have Punisher.

2853
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:50,000
Change one.

2854
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,580
Oh, Punisher's behind us, Punisher's behind us.

2855
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:53,080
I don't have ult.

2856
02:10:53,460 --> 02:10:54,120
I will reinforce.

2857
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:55,880
They're double ulting.

2858
02:10:57,940 --> 02:10:59,380
I have ult here.

2859
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:00,420
I'm ulting this.

2860
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:03,360
Kill the supports.

2861
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:11,320
It ends in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2862
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:11,740
It's gone.

2863
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,140
They have Bucky on me.

2864
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:16,880
They used Bucky off there.

2865
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:22,840
Did they Luna ult that?

2866
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:24,660
I got...

2867
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:26,660
They used it.

2868
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:28,900
I got Luna.

2869
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:31,960
No, it was theirs too.

2870
02:11:35,940 --> 02:11:37,780
Oh my god.

2871
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:42,040
There's a turret.

2872
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:50,340
Oh, we're dead here.

2873
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:53,600
Again.

2874
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:55,700
Oh no, again.

2875
02:11:56,540 --> 02:11:57,000
Again.

2876
02:11:57,300 --> 02:11:57,760
Again.

2877
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:03,680
Oh, he got it.

2878
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:13,040
I saw him die.

2879
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:14,460
We can't heal you there.

2880
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:26,740
I'm gonna start...

2881
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:29,940
I killed one.

2882
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:35,060
That poor guy.

2883
02:12:37,780 --> 02:12:41,060
Oh, please top me off a little bit.

2884
02:12:42,140 --> 02:12:43,580
Jesus Christ.

2885
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:44,860
I have to reload.

2886
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:53,620
Oh my god.

2887
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:54,100
Please.

2888
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:55,380
Please.

2889
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:00,740
Jesus Christ.

2890
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:03,020
Jesus Christ.

2891
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:04,840
You're all taking so much damage.

2892
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:11,160
I am ready to put on a show.

2893
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:13,560
Why are we not killing the turrets?

2894
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:16,660
I'm ulting here.

2895
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,220
Okay, maybe we didn't...

2896
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:28,940
Maybe we didn't need that.

2897
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:32,940
They used again, right?

2898
02:13:33,860 --> 02:13:35,220
Yep, they used again.

2899
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:36,400
I'm gonna go no more.

2900
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:38,240
So they should have Magneto ult then.

2901
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:39,720
And maybe Vantus ult.

2902
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:51,270
I'm going backwards.

2903
02:13:51,790 --> 02:13:52,790
I'm scared.

2904
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:54,930
Oh my god.

2905
02:13:55,890 --> 02:13:57,790
Oh my god.

2906
02:14:00,190 --> 02:14:02,430
There it is.

2907
02:14:02,630 --> 02:14:03,430
They're hard pushing.

2908
02:14:06,350 --> 02:14:07,150
Alright.

2909
02:14:10,710 --> 02:14:11,410
Fear!

2910
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:15,230
Frozen Magneto.

2911
02:14:18,130 --> 02:14:18,830
Fear.

2912
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:22,510
Fear.

2913
02:14:24,530 --> 02:14:25,610
Mag half.

2914
02:14:28,890 --> 02:14:32,270
I should go shield him.

2915
02:14:35,810 --> 02:14:37,010
Oh, you're...

2916
02:14:37,010 --> 02:14:37,590
I can heal you.

2917
02:14:37,590 --> 02:14:37,830
I got you.

2918
02:14:37,890 --> 02:14:38,130
I got you.

2919
02:14:40,490 --> 02:14:41,610
Nice, my goat.

2920
02:14:42,350 --> 02:14:43,110
One fear.

2921
02:14:46,270 --> 02:14:47,390
One fear.

2922
02:14:52,770 --> 02:14:54,070
I hear fear.

2923
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:54,510
Fear.

2924
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:56,850
Actual fear.

2925
02:14:58,810 --> 02:15:00,530
He's fucking going crazy.

2926
02:15:04,210 --> 02:15:05,070
I have ult here.

2927
02:15:05,170 --> 02:15:06,190
Look, he's going to farm ult.

2928
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:12,050
Oh my god.

2929
02:15:12,110 --> 02:15:13,410
I have two seconds.

2930
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:13,930
Two seconds.

2931
02:15:19,810 --> 02:15:21,030
I can't see.

2932
02:15:21,330 --> 02:15:23,270
I can't see!

2933
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:28,470
Oh, I'm gonna ult this here.

2934
02:15:28,610 --> 02:15:28,910
It's fine.

2935
02:15:28,970 --> 02:15:29,210
It's fine.

2936
02:15:29,210 --> 02:15:30,970
It's fine.

2937
02:15:32,350 --> 02:15:34,810
Oh, I can't see you, Punisher.

2938
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:39,950
No more ult.

2939
02:15:40,070 --> 02:15:40,610
No more ult.

2940
02:15:43,030 --> 02:15:44,190
Oh my god.

2941
02:15:44,730 --> 02:15:45,810
Not again!

2942
02:15:47,570 --> 02:15:48,370
How?!

2943
02:15:48,370 --> 02:15:51,810
Why were they all split up?

2944
02:15:53,050 --> 02:15:54,470
Our lowkey is 10% to ult.

2945
02:15:57,070 --> 02:15:58,130
Oh, nevermind.

2946
02:15:58,130 --> 02:15:59,430
He fucking did.

2947
02:16:00,230 --> 02:16:01,910
Why did our Punisher not drop down?

2948
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:06,370
Oh my god!

2949
02:16:17,070 --> 02:16:20,130
Why did he not drop down?!

2950
02:16:28,130 --> 02:16:31,130
I literally was just ulting this for a strange...

2951
02:16:33,550 --> 02:16:34,830
If it was like...

2952
02:16:34,830 --> 02:16:36,330
God, Punisher, goddamn you!

2953
02:16:40,070 --> 02:16:40,550
Okay.

2954
02:16:42,030 --> 02:16:43,950
Oh my god, I'll fucking get rid of the turrets.

2955
02:16:44,090 --> 02:16:45,570
Guys, there's three of us.

2956
02:16:45,870 --> 02:16:48,250
One of us should be able to hit that turret, right?

2957
02:16:50,990 --> 02:16:51,470
Oh.

2958
02:16:56,980 --> 02:16:57,460
Nice.

2959
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:04,560
Oh my god.

2960
02:17:04,580 --> 02:17:06,120
Don't worry, you're so healthy!

2961
02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:07,720
You're so healthy!

2962
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:13,420
You're so healthy!

2963
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:25,580
I'm like 10% left to ult.

2964
02:17:26,460 --> 02:17:27,220
Bucky no ult.

2965
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:28,540
I got Bucky ult.

2966
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:29,440
I'll get my Bucky ult here.

2967
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:31,580
I'm 10% if you guys can...

2968
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:34,520
I have 9%.

2969
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:35,060
5%?

2970
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:38,800
I have it, I have it, I have it.

2971
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:41,960
I'm doing it!

2972
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:44,040
Play around me again.

2973
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:46,500
Okay, sorry.

2974
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:54,040
Two seconds, two, one, zero, no more.

2975
02:17:55,880 --> 02:17:57,200
Oh, the Bucky's on me.

2976
02:17:57,480 --> 02:17:58,220
Bucky low, Bucky low!

2977
02:17:58,840 --> 02:17:59,920
Oh, he's getting healed, nevermind.

2978
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:10,540
Nice, nice, we got Bucky, we got Bucky.

2979
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:15,380
You guys, we're up one.

2980
02:18:19,460 --> 02:18:21,340
I need a third Punisher.

2981
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:23,640
I'm helping, I'm helping, I'm helping now, I'm helping.

2982
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:32,200
It's huge, it's huge.

2983
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:33,880
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

2984
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:35,540
I have no more on me.

2985
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:36,680
No more, no more, no more.

2986
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:37,580
I have no more, no more, one.

2987
02:18:42,170 --> 02:18:42,570
Bucky no ult.

2988
02:18:42,570 --> 02:18:43,850
Oh my god, Magnio's one, Magnio's one.

2989
02:18:47,350 --> 02:18:47,910
Alright, nice.

2990
02:18:48,110 --> 02:18:49,370
If you keep bullying their Bucky, we'll win.

2991
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:52,010
He's MVP'd every single one of his last 20 games.

2992
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:53,050
He's obviously cheating.

2993
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:57,390
He's distracting people through walls.

2994
02:18:58,670 --> 02:19:00,470
I think he was cheating a couple of times ago, but it's kind of...

2995
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:01,850
I don't know.

2996
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:06,970
Wait, is that right?

2997
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:07,890
Is that right, is that guy?

2998
02:19:08,450 --> 02:19:10,530
Let's just match history after this.

2999
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:12,770
I thought he was cheating a few games ago, but...

3000
02:19:15,810 --> 02:19:16,730
Repair won't hurt.

3001
02:19:17,930 --> 02:19:18,170
Yeah.

3002
02:19:19,610 --> 02:19:21,090
You know what they need to do in this game?

3003
02:19:21,170 --> 02:19:22,770
They need to make it so if you play as a cheater...

3004
02:19:23,890 --> 02:19:24,590
Whoa, whoa.

3005
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:26,610
It's a simple mechanic.

3006
02:19:27,370 --> 02:19:30,110
At least no one's saying that one about me and Boger.

3007
02:19:35,470 --> 02:19:37,050
Oh, this guy.

3008
02:19:37,690 --> 02:19:40,870
This guy belongs here.

3009
02:19:42,410 --> 02:19:43,810
Wait, did it save?

3010
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:47,710
Can we call triple support?

3011
02:19:49,310 --> 02:19:50,330
Triple support.

3012
02:19:51,230 --> 02:19:53,310
Who are you?

3013
02:19:53,410 --> 02:19:54,430
Answer the question.

3014
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:55,330
Why would you think that?

3015
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:56,890
Whoa.

3016
02:19:57,830 --> 02:19:58,210
No.

3017
02:19:58,690 --> 02:19:59,370
Whoa.

3018
02:20:02,090 --> 02:20:03,770
I'm woman too.

3019
02:20:10,210 --> 02:20:12,030
I'm also woman.

3020
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:25,890
Alright, it's fine.

3021
02:20:28,210 --> 02:20:29,210
I need to break more turrets.

3022
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:32,750
Oh, you're so low.

3023
02:20:35,790 --> 02:20:41,750
Jesus Christ, I clap, I clap, I clap, I clap, I clap, I clap, I clap, I clap.

3024
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:46,790
It's alright, I still clap.

3025
02:20:47,110 --> 02:20:49,450
I keep clapping until stuff happens.

3026
02:20:50,030 --> 02:20:51,110
I do my job.

3027
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:52,990
All I do is clap.

3028
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:57,050
Oh my god.

3029
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:02,260
There's a Bucky on high ground.

3030
02:21:06,190 --> 02:21:07,410
Jesus Christ.

3031
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:09,110
This is my job.

3032
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:10,170
I know my place.

3033
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:12,910
I heal like this.

3034
02:21:13,310 --> 02:21:15,790
Hoping for something new to happen.

3035
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:19,330
I just keep healing.

3036
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:21,090
And then I start clapping.

3037
02:21:22,790 --> 02:21:24,930
It's like my own 9 to 5.

3038
02:21:28,930 --> 02:21:31,250
This is my 9 to 5.

3039
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:32,690
It's called the clap to 5.

3040
02:21:34,230 --> 02:21:35,250
Alright, it's fine.

3041
02:21:41,380 --> 02:21:43,180
Holy fuck, I'm gonna be on the cart.

3042
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:44,080
Why is one healed?

3043
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:51,380
3 seconds, 2, 1.

3044
02:21:54,700 --> 02:21:56,020
I'm dead here to Bucky.

3045
02:21:58,260 --> 02:21:59,620
Bucky has it again.

3046
02:22:04,380 --> 02:22:04,820
Again.

3047
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:08,780
Oh, he lost it again.

3048
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:11,860
What support ults did they use there?

3049
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:19,800
Oh, so they still have Mantis then.

3050
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:22,200
They used Bucky ult too.

3051
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:26,800
That's crazy though.

3052
02:22:29,620 --> 02:22:30,020
Alright.

3053
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:33,680
He'll be okay, right?

3054
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,000
You'll be okay, my little guy.

3055
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:36,500
Alright.

3056
02:22:37,820 --> 02:22:39,140
I need to push with the Luna ult.

3057
02:22:47,150 --> 02:22:48,390
Oh my god.

3058
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:54,110
I need to reload.

3059
02:22:56,010 --> 02:22:57,150
Oh, Wolverine, Wolverine.

3060
02:22:57,270 --> 02:22:59,490
No more, no more, no more.

3061
02:22:59,530 --> 02:23:00,250
It's on our Wolverine.

3062
02:23:02,730 --> 02:23:03,450
No more, one.

3063
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:07,950
Come on, walk, walk, walk.

3064
02:23:08,250 --> 02:23:09,210
They die, they die, they die.

3065
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:10,150
Alright.

3066
02:23:11,130 --> 02:23:11,870
I'm pushing up.

3067
02:23:14,490 --> 02:23:15,410
He has no abilities.

3068
02:23:15,550 --> 02:23:16,210
Max has no abilities.

3069
02:23:16,410 --> 02:23:17,390
He's cutting himself off.

3070
02:23:18,610 --> 02:23:19,670
He has no bubble, no shield.

3071
02:23:20,230 --> 02:23:21,410
We're coming up.

3072
02:23:25,410 --> 02:23:26,210
Don't worry.

3073
02:23:31,550 --> 02:23:32,970
Everything will be fine.

3074
02:23:33,970 --> 02:23:34,910
They have their Luna ult back.

3075
02:23:37,530 --> 02:23:38,830
I can't see you, Wolverine.

3076
02:23:40,110 --> 02:23:41,270
I'm ulting to you guys.

3077
02:23:42,310 --> 02:23:43,310
That's good, good, good.

3078
02:23:43,650 --> 02:23:45,110
I'm telling you, you can eat it.

3079
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:47,530
Let me cut that.

3080
02:23:48,970 --> 02:23:51,390
Three seconds, three seconds, two, one.

3081
02:23:51,490 --> 02:23:52,770
I'm backing up.

3082
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:57,870
He just pre-hooked me through a wall.

3083
02:23:59,770 --> 02:24:00,790
Oh, oh.

3084
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:03,830
That's unfortunate.

3085
02:24:04,310 --> 02:24:05,310
They have strange ult here.

3086
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:11,280
I can't, oh, I have to reload there.

3087
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:13,100
Probably dead here.

3088
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:14,700
Wait, can we talk?

3089
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:15,640
What?

3090
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:19,000
He got it again?

3091
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:20,580
Wait, he has it again?

3092
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:21,340
Yeah.

3093
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:22,060
I'm telling you.

3094
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:25,700
He's cheating.

3095
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:27,160
I'm not gonna lie.

3096
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:30,420
If he is cheating, there's no way to lose.

3097
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:33,980
Wait, is he like, is he actually dealing with their Luna?

3098
02:24:35,560 --> 02:24:35,960
Probably.

3099
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:38,140
But I think we still win this game if we luck it.

3100
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:41,920
He plays with a lot of pro players, though.

3101
02:24:45,020 --> 02:24:45,420
Alright.

3102
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:51,200
Like, I've seen that Jhin girl before, and she duos with, I know she stacks with a lot of pro players.

3103
02:24:51,320 --> 02:24:56,120
That's why I'm like, I'm like surprised if she's playing with a cheater.

3104
02:25:00,570 --> 02:25:01,670
We gotta push for that.

3105
02:25:04,610 --> 02:25:05,010
What?

3106
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:07,770
Okay, let's watch this.

3107
02:25:08,510 --> 02:25:10,190
I'm down, I'm down, I got died to, Bucky.

3108
02:25:12,050 --> 02:25:13,950
Bucky's gonna get his ult in the next fight.

3109
02:25:16,430 --> 02:25:18,050
Oh, that's true.

3110
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:28,020
But like, the guy is on a GM3 account, so it lowers the matchmaking for her.

3111
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:34,340
That's why I'm like, are you sure she's cheating?

3112
02:25:34,420 --> 02:25:40,040
Cause I've seen that Jhin girl play with like, a lot of pro players in rank, so I'm like, I don't know.

3113
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:42,040
Cause I've seen her play with like, Mace before.

3114
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:43,080
I'm about to mag her.

3115
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:44,580
Wait, I got mag her, I got mag her.

3116
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:45,860
That's why I'm like, are you sure?

3117
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:48,660
I'm gonna mag with you.

3118
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:49,760
Mag his half, mag his half.

3119
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:52,420
Oh, it's Tristana, Tristana's frozen.

3120
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:55,320
I'm gonna ult to try and save you.

3121
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:00,940
I'm pushing up with this.

3122
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:04,860
4 seconds, 3, 2, 1.

3123
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:07,720
I'm trying to keep you up.

3124
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:12,380
We can't get to you.

3125
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:19,850
Oh my god.

3126
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:23,370
Tower is off the essence.

3127
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:25,790
Okay, I'm just far.

3128
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:29,150
Wait, this is our last fight.

3129
02:26:39,970 --> 02:26:41,730
6 seconds though.

3130
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:46,810
Oh my god.

3131
02:26:46,950 --> 02:26:47,690
Oh, Berserker.

3132
02:26:49,550 --> 02:26:50,210
Again.

3133
02:26:51,690 --> 02:26:52,810
Look at his...

3134
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:57,230
Like, he literally built his ult.

3135
02:26:58,330 --> 02:27:03,470
We capped first, he used it, and then we're second halfway and he's already using it again.

3136
02:27:03,870 --> 02:27:04,450
What the fuck.

3137
02:27:06,730 --> 02:27:08,390
I mean, we just look at the replay.

3138
02:27:11,950 --> 02:27:14,990
Rosa carrying from the back of the bus.

3139
02:27:18,170 --> 02:27:19,290
Holy shit.

3140
02:27:19,290 --> 02:27:24,650
That's why I'm like hesitant on the whole cheating allegations, because I know Din plays with pro players.

3141
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:26,730
Like, stacks with pro players.

3142
02:27:26,930 --> 02:27:28,390
So like, I mean, I play with Boger.

3143
02:27:28,590 --> 02:27:29,550
That's why I'm like...

3144
02:27:29,550 --> 02:27:32,130
But I play with people who are like, who are known accounts.

3145
02:27:32,590 --> 02:27:35,490
Rosa is clearly an alt account, because it's a GM account.

3146
02:27:36,370 --> 02:27:40,550
So it's a pro player on a smurf account.

3147
02:27:41,070 --> 02:27:46,210
So like, that's why I'm like, I don't think he's hacking, just because I know who Din plays with.

3148
02:27:46,390 --> 02:27:48,530
Because I've seen her play with Mace.

3149
02:27:48,530 --> 02:27:51,510
I've seen her play with Mace, and I've seen her play with a lot of other pro players.

3150
02:27:52,050 --> 02:27:57,950
So I know, like, it's really weird if she fucking duos with a hacker all of a sudden.

3151
02:27:59,470 --> 02:27:59,850
Yeah.

3152
02:28:00,990 --> 02:28:04,230
I just think it's weird if she suddenly decides to duo with a hacker.

3153
02:28:05,550 --> 02:28:06,410
Yes, oh wait.

3154
02:28:06,470 --> 02:28:08,210
Oh wait, no, it's an Eternity account.

3155
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:09,610
I thought it was a GM account.

3156
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:10,910
Okay, it's just an Eternity account.

3157
02:28:11,930 --> 02:28:13,530
So it's somebody on an alt account.

3158
02:28:14,430 --> 02:28:15,510
It's an alt account.

3159
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:18,310
Yeah, there's a tournament thing.

3160
02:28:20,910 --> 02:28:21,810
I thought it was a GM account.

3161
02:28:22,950 --> 02:28:25,430
But it's definitely an alt account, because it's level 22.

3162
02:28:28,170 --> 02:28:31,690
You're like, it's spectating time!

3163
02:28:37,870 --> 02:28:39,910
You're like, it's time!

3164
02:28:46,130 --> 02:28:48,730
I just think it's just a good player that's on an alt account.

3165
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:50,510
That's really all I think.

3166
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:56,510
Pull up the VOD.

3167
02:28:56,690 --> 02:28:59,890
I don't need to spectate, just because I know it's just a really good player.

3168
02:29:02,170 --> 02:29:03,270
I just thought it was funny.

3169
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:05,130
Well, it wasn't funny, but like...

3170
02:29:06,550 --> 02:29:08,090
I'm just like, damn.

3171
02:29:09,470 --> 02:29:09,910
Damn.

3172
02:29:12,450 --> 02:29:15,110
Misogyny insults are so fucking low tier, though.

3173
02:29:15,390 --> 02:29:16,310
It's so low tier.

3174
02:29:16,310 --> 02:29:18,110
Insult where it actually hurts.

3175
02:29:19,210 --> 02:29:21,010
Like, that's what I'm saying.

3176
02:29:21,150 --> 02:29:25,910
If you use misogyny as an insult, it's such a low tier insult.

3177
02:29:26,330 --> 02:29:27,570
Just insult skills.

3178
02:29:27,930 --> 02:29:31,430
If you really want to hurt somebody, that's how high I feel.

3179
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:53,400
I mean, no, Rose is fucking insane.

3180
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,580
He's actually insane.

3181
02:29:56,380 --> 02:29:58,340
I don't know who he is, but he's good.

3182
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:00,280
I shine in darkness.

3183
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:03,580
You're bad at this game.

3184
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:05,220
Yes, because I spent...

3185
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:11,720
I have 120 plus hours on Marvel Rivals.

3186
02:30:11,940 --> 02:30:14,220
If you call me bad, I will cry.

3187
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:19,680
It's like, all those hours for nothing?

3188
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:25,260
It's literally all those hours I spent.

3189
02:30:29,540 --> 02:30:30,740
What do I do?

3190
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:33,340
Was it all for nothing?

3191
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:39,020
Yay, now I'm getting boosted by Rosa!

3192
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:40,120
Let's go!

3193
02:30:41,220 --> 02:30:42,980
I swear to God, if you fucking...

3194
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:46,860
If you lose this for me, Rosa, I'm fucking reporting you.

3195
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:51,860
I swear to God.

3196
02:30:55,440 --> 02:30:57,060
Oh shit, my knuckles.

3197
02:30:57,060 --> 02:31:00,020
I'm surprised they're not banning Bucky.

3198
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:03,120
I'm so surprised.

3199
02:31:04,480 --> 02:31:05,080
Yay!

3200
02:31:15,590 --> 02:31:16,190
Starlord.

3201
02:31:16,370 --> 02:31:17,730
Starlord is 8th tier.

3202
02:31:18,530 --> 02:31:19,730
Imagine if Rosa throws...

3203
02:31:19,730 --> 02:31:22,430
I swear to God, I'll fucking report him live on stream.

3204
02:31:27,110 --> 02:31:28,310
Woman boosted.

3205
02:31:28,310 --> 02:31:29,570
Oh my God.

3206
02:31:29,930 --> 02:31:32,130
If I'm getting boosted, we're all getting...

3207
02:31:32,130 --> 02:31:34,630
Alright, it can't be woman boosted.

3208
02:31:34,670 --> 02:31:36,870
Because there's men in this team too.

3209
02:31:37,050 --> 02:31:39,170
We're all on the same boat together.

3210
02:31:42,810 --> 02:31:45,870
We're all also getting boosted together.

3211
02:31:47,010 --> 02:31:49,690
So, men and women boosted?

3212
02:31:49,850 --> 02:31:53,930
I like how they called out Din for saying that she's getting boosted.

3213
02:31:53,930 --> 02:31:58,510
When she has an entire fucking team that's on the backs of Rosa.

3214
02:32:02,190 --> 02:32:05,790
Everybody on that team was getting hard carried by Rosa.

3215
02:32:06,770 --> 02:32:09,630
Equal opportunity boosting, let's go!

3216
02:32:11,850 --> 02:32:14,190
Oh my God, now two women are...

3217
02:32:16,250 --> 02:32:17,650
Oh my God.

3218
02:32:17,930 --> 02:32:20,390
Alright, Rosa, you get this.

3219
02:32:20,590 --> 02:32:21,370
Let's go.

3220
02:32:21,370 --> 02:32:23,470
Now it's my turn.

3221
02:32:24,910 --> 02:32:26,610
It's my turn.

3222
02:32:27,110 --> 02:32:28,410
Let's fucking go.

3223
02:32:29,730 --> 02:32:30,750
There's a Psylocke behind us.

3224
02:32:31,950 --> 02:32:33,090
I froze Iron Fist.

3225
02:32:37,570 --> 02:32:41,250
Oh my God, I got stuck on the fucking walls.

3226
02:32:44,110 --> 02:32:44,970
That was awkward.

3227
02:32:48,490 --> 02:32:50,110
We're up two, we should push up.

3228
02:32:52,350 --> 02:32:53,730
You're welled out for heals?

3229
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,620
Groot, Groot, Groot, Groot on Mantis.

3230
02:33:03,710 --> 02:33:04,990
Alright, nice.

3231
02:33:05,750 --> 02:33:06,850
Everything is fine.

3232
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:10,750
Oh, there he goes again!

3233
02:33:12,250 --> 02:33:13,310
Oh, he's dead.

3234
02:33:14,750 --> 02:33:15,390
No!

3235
02:33:16,730 --> 02:33:17,450
Iron Fist, Iron Fist.

3236
02:33:25,270 --> 02:33:28,410
He already got the ult, isn't that fucking crazy?

3237
02:33:29,470 --> 02:33:30,990
Go, Rosa, go!

3238
02:33:31,610 --> 02:33:32,610
Go, Rosa!

3239
02:33:33,210 --> 02:33:34,690
Go, Rosa, go!

3240
02:33:34,990 --> 02:33:36,350
Do your thing, Rosa!

3241
02:33:37,430 --> 02:33:38,390
Wait, wait, stream, stream, stream!

3242
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:39,130
Stream is half.

3243
02:33:44,450 --> 02:33:44,990
Mantis.

3244
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:48,810
We can do Mantis ult first.

3245
02:33:51,590 --> 02:33:52,130
Alright.

3246
02:33:53,570 --> 02:33:54,110
Alright.

3247
02:33:56,490 --> 02:33:57,510
For womankind!

3248
02:34:03,890 --> 02:34:05,290
Well, maybe I should...

3249
02:34:05,290 --> 02:34:08,530
I was gonna say, maybe I should add Rosa and poach him.

3250
02:34:12,630 --> 02:34:13,530
Oh shit.

3251
02:34:14,630 --> 02:34:17,890
Let me just, let me poach Rosa real quick.

3252
02:34:18,270 --> 02:34:20,650
I ain't, I'm shameless, that's a Q, right?

3253
02:34:22,430 --> 02:34:23,150
I'm ulting this.

3254
02:34:28,310 --> 02:34:30,410
They have, they basically have all their ults.

3255
02:34:32,030 --> 02:34:33,590
Oh nevermind, they're dead.

3256
02:34:34,510 --> 02:34:35,970
Iron Fist one, Iron Fist low.

3257
02:34:37,090 --> 02:34:38,050
Iron Fist half.

3258
02:34:39,610 --> 02:34:40,630
I'm gonna Strange.

3259
02:34:41,630 --> 02:34:44,290
They should have Strange ult here and Iron Fist ult.

3260
02:34:44,830 --> 02:34:46,190
Use both supports though.

3261
02:34:48,770 --> 02:34:50,610
Oh, there he goes!

3262
02:34:51,050 --> 02:34:52,450
Go, Rosa, go!

3263
02:34:55,110 --> 02:34:56,390
For womankind!

3264
02:34:57,490 --> 02:34:58,690
Let's go!

3265
02:34:59,390 --> 02:35:01,910
We get like two people at least down here.

3266
02:35:03,870 --> 02:35:04,870
Let's go!

3267
02:35:05,910 --> 02:35:09,510
Go have the time of your fucking life!

3268
02:35:12,030 --> 02:35:13,330
Oh, they can touch, they touch.

3269
02:35:15,670 --> 02:35:17,670
I can kill them, but it doesn't matter.

3270
02:35:22,330 --> 02:35:22,830
Assemble!

3271
02:35:22,830 --> 02:35:23,190
Go!

3272
02:35:30,850 --> 02:35:31,790
I'm alive!

3273
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:34,830
Don't worry, Rosa's coming in!

3274
02:35:35,370 --> 02:35:36,970
Rosa, get in there!

3275
02:35:37,690 --> 02:35:39,330
Rosa, do your thing!

3276
02:35:41,630 --> 02:35:42,730
Rosa's here!

3277
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:45,550
Captain, he's one, he's low, he's half.

3278
02:35:47,330 --> 02:35:48,130
There we go.

3279
02:35:48,690 --> 02:35:50,130
Go, Rosa, go!

3280
02:35:51,510 --> 02:35:52,610
Rosa's gonna...

3281
02:35:52,610 --> 02:35:54,490
He's gonna get in there and get his ult.

3282
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:55,830
Let's fucking go!

3283
02:35:58,090 --> 02:35:59,770
Do that thing, Rosa!

3284
02:36:00,310 --> 02:36:01,370
What if I poach him?

3285
02:36:01,890 --> 02:36:09,530
What if I literally just steal him?

3286
02:36:12,410 --> 02:36:12,970
Tokido!

3287
02:36:17,770 --> 02:36:19,190
No, I'm gonna take him.

3288
02:36:20,130 --> 02:36:21,010
I'm a Rosa.

3289
02:36:21,270 --> 02:36:23,310
Oh my god, you're one of those women.

3290
02:36:24,730 --> 02:36:26,590
I'm gonna steal your...

3291
02:36:26,590 --> 02:36:28,530
Whoa, there's an Iron Fist behind me.

3292
02:36:29,690 --> 02:36:31,310
I'm gonna steal your red.

3293
02:36:32,590 --> 02:36:33,870
Steal your Bucky!

3294
02:36:38,170 --> 02:36:39,350
Okay, I got the Ashe.

3295
02:36:41,750 --> 02:36:42,270
No,

3296
02:36:46,590 --> 02:36:47,990
I don't wanna be a homewrecker!

3297
02:36:47,990 --> 02:36:50,030
Three, two, one.

3298
02:36:50,230 --> 02:37:06,020
No, I'm not a homewrecker!

3299
02:37:06,860 --> 02:37:10,720
It was just a joke!

3300
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:15,360
For women, guys.

3301
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:18,920
I would never do something that fucked up, guys.

3302
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:23,700
Unless it's crazy.

3303
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:28,560
Nope, nope.

3304
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:30,420
I just get off now.

3305
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:32,960
Oh, he's ready.

3306
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:35,380
So as a joke...

3307
02:37:35,380 --> 02:37:36,360
It could save...

3308
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:37,160
Oh, you're right!

3309
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:39,540
It could save me five days!

3310
02:37:40,060 --> 02:37:41,720
Oh my god, you're so right.

3311
02:37:47,620 --> 02:37:49,260
Oh my god.

3312
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:56,560
What do you mean?

3313
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:58,760
Don't leave your Bucky around, Toekeeper!

3314
02:37:59,000 --> 02:37:59,680
That's different!

3315
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:06,080
Don't leave your booster around, Toekeeper.

3316
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:12,560
That is the truth.

3317
02:38:13,940 --> 02:38:15,800
Shaking my head.

3318
02:38:17,500 --> 02:38:18,960
Oh, I'm just saying.

3319
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:21,500
It's right there.

3320
02:38:22,780 --> 02:38:25,620
Five days in and you're already free.

3321
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:28,820
Don't leave your wife or husband.

3322
02:38:35,210 --> 02:38:37,070
I would never, guys.

3323
02:38:37,110 --> 02:38:38,690
I'm not a homewrecker, guys.

3324
02:38:38,850 --> 02:38:39,490
I'm not.

3325
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:41,790
Guys, I'm not a homewrecker!

3326
02:38:41,790 --> 02:38:43,570
It was a joke!

3327
02:38:43,950 --> 02:38:45,770
It was a hee-haw!

3328
02:38:47,870 --> 02:38:48,590
Unless...

3329
02:38:52,270 --> 02:38:52,990
Unless...

3330
02:38:56,390 --> 02:38:58,470
I'm gonna take your duel.

3331
02:39:03,870 --> 02:39:05,910
I don't believe you.

3332
02:39:06,090 --> 02:39:06,870
Guys, I would never.

3333
02:39:06,930 --> 02:39:07,830
That's so fucked up.

3334
02:39:08,210 --> 02:39:08,850
I would never.

3335
02:39:09,630 --> 02:39:11,210
For womankind, everybody.

3336
02:39:13,070 --> 02:39:14,190
For womankind!

3337
02:39:18,850 --> 02:39:19,970
Jesus Christ.

3338
02:39:22,050 --> 02:39:30,630
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

3339
02:39:30,750 --> 02:39:31,670
No more clapping, though.

3340
02:39:32,290 --> 02:39:32,970
No more clapping.

3341
02:39:34,130 --> 02:39:35,350
Oh, please top me off.

3342
02:39:35,470 --> 02:39:35,630
No!

3343
02:39:38,470 --> 02:39:40,210
And that's why I will add...

3344
02:39:43,330 --> 02:39:45,510
And that is why I will steal.

3345
02:39:49,310 --> 02:39:51,050
That was my line.

3346
02:39:56,550 --> 02:39:57,650
Alright, there you go.

3347
02:39:58,490 --> 02:39:58,730
It's fine.

3348
02:39:59,830 --> 02:40:01,370
It only takes one bad heal.

3349
02:40:05,870 --> 02:40:07,470
I froze strange.

3350
02:40:09,150 --> 02:40:11,070
I am ready to put on a show!

3351
02:40:11,670 --> 02:40:12,890
I'm like 20% off.

3352
02:40:13,010 --> 02:40:15,370
We kite this, and then we crash out, okay?

3353
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:16,170
You can even get a little.

3354
02:40:16,770 --> 02:40:17,610
Oh my god.

3355
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:19,810
We're up one.

3356
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:20,290
In the corner.

3357
02:40:21,410 --> 02:40:22,250
Oh, here he goes!

3358
02:40:22,290 --> 02:40:22,930
He's coming in!

3359
02:40:23,090 --> 02:40:24,110
He's going in!

3360
02:40:24,690 --> 02:40:25,490
I have Black Panther on me.

3361
02:40:25,550 --> 02:40:26,150
I have Black Panther on me.

3362
02:40:27,010 --> 02:40:27,510
Back here.

3363
02:40:30,610 --> 02:40:31,190
Here we go.

3364
02:40:31,570 --> 02:40:32,010
It's fine.

3365
02:40:32,650 --> 02:40:33,210
Why, why, why?

3366
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:34,130
You're so healthy.

3367
02:40:34,550 --> 02:40:35,090
Why are you sleeping?

3368
02:40:35,250 --> 02:40:35,610
Why don't you sleep?

3369
02:40:36,990 --> 02:40:37,450
You're so healthy.

3370
02:40:37,450 --> 02:40:38,530
Black Panther's one.

3371
02:40:40,970 --> 02:40:42,090
You're so healthy.

3372
02:40:43,090 --> 02:40:45,230
Oh, he doesn't see me.

3373
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:46,450
He doesn't see me.

3374
02:40:46,550 --> 02:40:47,790
Look at me go!

3375
02:40:48,490 --> 02:40:49,450
There we go.

3376
02:40:49,530 --> 02:40:50,490
Wait, did we kill Black Panther?

3377
02:40:51,670 --> 02:40:52,410
Yeah, I killed him.

3378
02:40:52,450 --> 02:40:53,170
Okay, okay.

3379
02:40:53,890 --> 02:40:55,550
We're one guy.

3380
02:41:01,550 --> 02:41:03,870
I could have had zero deaths, guys.

3381
02:41:05,090 --> 02:41:05,930
I'm poaching him.

3382
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:09,170
I would never do something that fucked up.

3383
02:41:09,250 --> 02:41:10,670
It's all jokes, guys.

3384
02:41:11,170 --> 02:41:13,290
It's all a silly joke.

3385
02:41:14,690 --> 02:41:16,190
Oh, I didn't realize you got your ult.

3386
02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:16,530
Sorry.

3387
02:41:17,990 --> 02:41:18,670
It's fine.

3388
02:41:18,870 --> 02:41:19,330
It's fine.

3389
02:41:19,390 --> 02:41:21,190
We don't even need other ults.

3390
02:41:22,810 --> 02:41:23,730
Here we go.

3391
02:41:26,310 --> 02:41:26,410
Oh!

3392
02:41:28,050 --> 02:41:28,950
That's fine.

3393
02:41:31,910 --> 02:41:33,270
That's so fine.

3394
02:41:33,850 --> 02:41:34,510
All I'm saying...

3395
02:41:34,510 --> 02:41:35,330
I didn't know.

3396
02:41:35,490 --> 02:41:38,190
I didn't know she had her ult.

3397
02:41:41,990 --> 02:41:42,630
Please.

3398
02:41:43,250 --> 02:41:44,330
I didn't know!

3399
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:46,110
I didn't know she got it!

3400
02:41:46,650 --> 02:41:48,250
I was like, she'll be fine.

3401
02:41:53,250 --> 02:41:54,510
I was not aware.

3402
02:41:54,990 --> 02:41:55,570
It's okay.

3403
02:41:55,930 --> 02:41:56,650
We just...

3404
02:41:56,650 --> 02:41:57,010
The more...

3405
02:41:57,010 --> 02:41:59,170
The longer we play, the more XP we get.

3406
02:41:59,810 --> 02:42:00,230
Guys.

3407
02:42:00,810 --> 02:42:02,030
We're XP farming.

3408
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:04,690
Guys, we're XP farming.

3409
02:42:05,690 --> 02:42:07,450
We're hard XP farming.

3410
02:42:10,410 --> 02:42:11,650
He's half.

3411
02:42:15,310 --> 02:42:16,190
Oh.

3412
02:42:16,870 --> 02:42:18,130
Oh, again.

3413
02:42:18,970 --> 02:42:20,650
Oh, he's gonna...

3414
02:42:20,650 --> 02:42:21,970
He's gonna get again!

3415
02:42:23,550 --> 02:42:24,130
No!

3416
02:42:28,360 --> 02:42:29,620
Come on.

3417
02:42:30,400 --> 02:42:31,040
For women!

3418
02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:34,000
For womankind everywhere, Rosa!

3419
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:34,780
We're...

3420
02:42:34,780 --> 02:42:35,560
Do something!

3421
02:42:36,820 --> 02:42:38,580
Let's stick out and do something.

3422
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:43,920
Come on.

3423
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:44,420
Do something.

3424
02:42:44,980 --> 02:42:45,680
Come on, Rosa.

3425
02:42:48,280 --> 02:42:49,960
Do it for women everywhere.

3426
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:51,560
Come on.

3427
02:42:52,940 --> 02:42:54,880
I thought you had a reputation to uphold.

3428
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:57,700
You got two women on this team.

3429
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,040
Come on, Rosa!

3430
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:02,000
There's a Black Panther.

3431
02:43:06,900 --> 02:43:07,760
There we go!

3432
02:43:08,800 --> 02:43:10,140
There we go!

3433
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:15,630
Go, Rosa, go!

3434
02:43:16,710 --> 02:43:17,830
Get another ult!

3435
02:43:18,770 --> 02:43:19,730
Wait, Mantis ult first.

3436
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:21,010
Alright.

3437
02:43:21,490 --> 02:43:21,930
I will...

3438
02:43:25,030 --> 02:43:25,870
She'll get her.

3439
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:26,750
Yeah, she has her ult.

3440
02:43:26,930 --> 02:43:27,730
I was like, should I heal?

3441
02:43:31,350 --> 02:43:32,210
It's fine.

3442
02:43:34,250 --> 02:43:35,170
You're so...

3443
02:43:35,170 --> 02:43:36,210
Oh my god.

3444
02:43:36,410 --> 02:43:37,230
He was not healthy.

3445
02:43:37,790 --> 02:43:39,710
I don't know what the fuck happened to him.

3446
02:43:39,950 --> 02:43:42,070
But he literally disappeared.

3447
02:43:44,630 --> 02:43:45,130
He...

3448
02:43:46,290 --> 02:43:48,510
He's looking for ult really hard here, by the way.

3449
02:43:49,530 --> 02:43:50,690
I got him.

3450
02:43:51,090 --> 02:43:52,570
He got nobody!

3451
02:43:56,630 --> 02:43:59,610
Fear, fear!

3452
02:44:00,650 --> 02:44:01,530
No more ult.

3453
02:44:02,610 --> 02:44:04,050
Oh my god!

3454
02:44:04,570 --> 02:44:05,290
Get me out of here!

3455
02:44:09,430 --> 02:44:11,230
Come on!

3456
02:44:11,550 --> 02:44:12,000
Rosa!

3457
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:19,860
Go, Rosa, go!

3458
02:44:21,980 --> 02:44:23,480
Again, Rosa!

3459
02:44:25,320 --> 02:44:27,280
Women is everywhere!

3460
02:44:29,100 --> 02:44:31,820
Now that was fucking...

3461
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:34,560
Do it for all the women!

3462
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:37,440
That's looking right!

3463
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:40,670
Women have been saved!

3464
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:42,880
There's a Black Panther above.

3465
02:44:48,610 --> 02:44:49,730
Oh my god.

3466
02:44:50,370 --> 02:44:51,110
Yes, you can.

3467
02:44:51,230 --> 02:44:54,770
It's surprising that a lot of people don't know you can shoot this leap.

3468
02:44:55,130 --> 02:44:57,010
It's actually very surprising.

3469
02:45:00,270 --> 02:45:03,690
A lot of people do not know that and it's...

3470
02:45:03,690 --> 02:45:05,110
It's a little embarrassing.

3471
02:45:06,550 --> 02:45:07,710
You're walled off, Magnus.

3472
02:45:13,570 --> 02:45:14,890
Goodbye, Rosa.

3473
02:45:15,050 --> 02:45:15,670
No!

3474
02:45:19,290 --> 02:45:22,590
How could you disappoint the women in the chat?

3475
02:45:28,550 --> 02:45:29,030
Alright.

3476
02:45:29,710 --> 02:45:30,210
We're up one.

3477
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:30,590
We should go.

3478
02:45:32,310 --> 02:45:33,230
We're half.

3479
02:45:33,270 --> 02:45:33,630
We're low.

3480
02:45:35,370 --> 02:45:36,290
We won.

3481
02:45:37,770 --> 02:45:38,210
Again!

3482
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:44,540
God, I'm mad.

3483
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:45,420
I love women.

3484
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:49,560
Final score...

3485
02:45:50,680 --> 02:45:50,940
3...

3486
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:51,680
2...

3487
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:52,540
1...

3488
02:45:52,540 --> 02:45:54,700
Yeah, that archer seems so fast.

3489
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:55,480
It's literally...

3490
02:45:55,480 --> 02:45:56,960
It's a Rosa diff.

3491
02:45:57,380 --> 02:45:59,360
Thank god for women.

3492
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:01,420
He did it!

3493
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:03,960
He did it for women everywhere!

3494
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:10,000
Women are so cool.

3495
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:14,580
I wish women were real.

3496
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:15,900
Alright.

3497
02:46:15,900 --> 02:46:16,920
Alright.

3498
02:46:17,100 --> 02:46:17,460
It's time.

3499
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:19,480
You know what this means.

3500
02:46:20,020 --> 02:46:21,900
I'm not actually gonna potion, but...

3501
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:32,380
Do you think he'll accept it?

3502
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:35,800
No way!

3503
02:46:36,900 --> 02:46:38,100
I'm not ever...

3504
02:46:38,100 --> 02:46:38,980
I'm not a wallbreaker!

3505
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:41,260
I just want to know if he'll accept it.

3506
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:44,440
Okay.

3507
02:46:45,900 --> 02:46:47,920
Should you shoot your shot...

3508
02:46:50,160 --> 02:46:56,120
...or woman kind by stealing somebody else's DPS player?

3509
02:46:56,580 --> 02:46:58,120
Look, I didn't say all women.

3510
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:02,220
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3511
02:47:02,420 --> 02:47:03,240
I'll be right back, guys.

3512
02:47:03,440 --> 02:47:04,070
I'll be right back.

3513
02:47:51,920 --> 02:47:52,560
Back.

3514
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:54,040
Are we Q-dodging?

3515
02:47:54,660 --> 02:47:55,060
Is that...

3516
02:47:55,060 --> 02:47:56,360
Oh, he's spectating!

3517
02:47:56,920 --> 02:47:58,290
Yeah, he's actually...

3518
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:00,920
He's actually spectating.

3519
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:02,400
Oh my god.

3520
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:04,600
He's double-checking.

3521
02:48:06,100 --> 02:48:07,920
He's double-checking everything.

3522
02:48:09,780 --> 02:48:11,260
That's crazy.

3523
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:15,380
He's like, alright, let's make sure.

3524
02:48:16,500 --> 02:48:18,860
I just added him as a friend.

3525
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:20,200
Nothing more.

3526
02:48:20,620 --> 02:48:23,020
Guys, I wasn't poaching anybody.

3527
02:48:23,260 --> 02:48:25,500
I just added him as a friend.

3528
02:48:26,060 --> 02:48:26,500
You know?

3529
02:48:31,860 --> 02:48:32,960
That's it, guys.

3530
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:33,920
That's it.

3531
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:38,060
Cal, thank you for the Twitch Prime link.

3532
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:38,380
Thank you.

3533
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:39,400
Hat, thank you for the donation.

3534
02:48:39,560 --> 02:48:40,340
Thank you, thank you.

3535
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:46,160
You keep singing a joke when you literally poached Mace from Wavy and you meanly crushed him in the match.

3536
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:48,740
Oh yeah, by the way, here's a Wavy update.

3537
02:48:50,260 --> 02:48:51,060
Here's a...

3538
02:48:52,260 --> 02:48:52,660
He...

3539
02:48:53,540 --> 02:48:55,400
He's not having a good time today.

3540
02:48:56,220 --> 02:48:57,540
Oh wait, is Mack climbing?

3541
02:48:58,120 --> 02:48:59,300
Hey Mack, you doing okay?

3542
02:48:59,300 --> 02:49:00,880
Wait, Mack's climbing!

3543
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:02,480
Let's fucking go!

3544
02:49:03,220 --> 02:49:04,660
I've always believed in him.

3545
02:49:05,060 --> 02:49:06,300
I've always believed in him.

3546
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:06,840
Good job.

3547
02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:10,520
Hun, Hun, thank you for the Twitch Prime link.

3548
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:11,460
Thank you.

3549
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:15,580
Ryko, the good tier 1 sub.

3550
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:16,480
Thank you, thank you.

3551
02:49:16,540 --> 02:49:17,620
I really appreciate it.

3552
02:49:17,720 --> 02:49:18,620
Thank you so much.

3553
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:20,500
Is he Ashe?

3554
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:21,780
I don't think he's hacking.

3555
02:49:21,940 --> 02:49:23,860
I just think he's just a really good player.

3556
02:49:24,060 --> 02:49:24,800
That's really it.

3557
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:26,920
I don't think he's hacking.

3558
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:29,920
Cause it'd be...

3559
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:30,560
I don't know.

3560
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:32,320
Just cause I know who they play with.

3561
02:49:35,810 --> 02:49:36,870
Cause it'd be like...

3562
02:49:37,210 --> 02:49:37,890
I don't know.

3563
02:49:38,050 --> 02:49:39,730
I just think it's...

3564
02:49:39,730 --> 02:49:40,610
Wait, he got off.

3565
02:49:40,850 --> 02:49:41,130
No.

3566
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:48,890
No.

3567
02:49:56,270 --> 02:49:57,590
I just think...

3568
02:49:57,590 --> 02:49:59,170
I think it'd be really weird.

3569
02:49:59,650 --> 02:50:00,790
Cause like...

3570
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:02,370
It's a little weird.

3571
02:50:03,010 --> 02:50:03,830
To do that.

3572
02:50:04,050 --> 02:50:05,310
To play with a hacker.

3573
02:50:06,530 --> 02:50:06,870
For...

3574
02:50:08,010 --> 02:50:09,370
For like...

3575
02:50:09,370 --> 02:50:10,350
Rank points.

3576
02:50:11,010 --> 02:50:12,590
Especially when like...

3577
02:50:13,510 --> 02:50:16,450
She plays in super high elo.

3578
02:50:16,990 --> 02:50:18,730
With a lot of streamers.

3579
02:50:19,390 --> 02:50:22,910
And like there's not a lot of female players in super high elo.

3580
02:50:23,210 --> 02:50:24,070
That talks.

3581
02:50:24,230 --> 02:50:24,850
And she talks.

3582
02:50:25,590 --> 02:50:26,730
So like...

3583
02:50:26,730 --> 02:50:27,670
It's very...

3584
02:50:27,670 --> 02:50:29,230
I think it's very...

3585
02:50:29,230 --> 02:50:30,330
I don't think he's hacking.

3586
02:50:30,710 --> 02:50:31,730
Just cause like...

3587
02:50:32,710 --> 02:50:34,950
You lose more than you gain from that.

3588
02:50:35,390 --> 02:50:35,950
Like...

3589
02:50:35,950 --> 02:50:38,630
You lose so much more.

3590
02:50:40,630 --> 02:50:41,190
Like...

3591
02:50:42,010 --> 02:50:43,830
If you play with a hacker.

3592
02:50:44,130 --> 02:50:44,970
You're just...

3593
02:50:44,970 --> 02:50:45,430
You're like...

3594
02:50:45,430 --> 02:50:46,470
You're literally...

3595
02:50:46,470 --> 02:50:47,190
It's done.

3596
02:50:47,430 --> 02:50:48,590
It's literally done.

3597
02:50:55,870 --> 02:50:56,710
It happens.

3598
02:50:56,790 --> 02:50:57,030
Yeah.

3599
02:50:57,150 --> 02:50:58,610
But not if you're like a calmer.

3600
02:50:58,770 --> 02:51:00,430
If you actually like calm and try.

3601
02:51:02,230 --> 02:51:03,710
Especially in super high elo.

3602
02:51:04,870 --> 02:51:06,390
It's actually like...

3603
02:51:06,390 --> 02:51:06,550
It's...

3604
02:51:06,550 --> 02:51:06,970
I don't know.

3605
02:51:07,150 --> 02:51:08,130
Like most likely.

3606
02:51:08,790 --> 02:51:10,230
That's why I like trust them.

3607
02:51:10,370 --> 02:51:12,630
When they say he's not hacking.

3608
02:51:13,390 --> 02:51:14,230
Just cause like...

3609
02:51:14,970 --> 02:51:16,830
She literally plays with like mace.

3610
02:51:17,210 --> 02:51:17,670
And them.

3611
02:51:18,110 --> 02:51:19,150
So like...

3612
02:51:19,150 --> 02:51:20,630
I feel like that's really weird.

3613
02:51:20,950 --> 02:51:21,470
Like...

3614
02:51:21,470 --> 02:51:22,570
If you have like...

3615
02:51:22,570 --> 02:51:23,830
If you have the opportunity.

3616
02:51:24,290 --> 02:51:26,950
To play with one of the top players.

3617
02:51:27,210 --> 02:51:28,350
Legit top players.

3618
02:51:28,810 --> 02:51:30,470
Why the fuck would you play with a hacker?

3619
02:51:31,070 --> 02:51:31,590
Like...

3620
02:51:32,390 --> 02:51:33,550
That's really it.

3621
02:51:33,770 --> 02:51:34,850
If you can...

3622
02:51:34,850 --> 02:51:35,950
If you have like...

3623
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:36,390
The opportunity.

3624
02:51:37,010 --> 02:51:39,190
To play with all these really really good players.

3625
02:51:39,770 --> 02:51:40,370
Like right now.

3626
02:51:40,450 --> 02:51:41,230
I'm playing with Boger.

3627
02:51:43,130 --> 02:51:43,570
Like...

3628
02:51:48,170 --> 02:51:49,030
I don't know.

3629
02:51:49,370 --> 02:51:49,850
But hey.

3630
02:51:50,010 --> 02:51:51,110
If she's gonna ruin her...

3631
02:51:51,110 --> 02:51:51,550
If they...

3632
02:51:51,550 --> 02:51:53,110
If she wants to ruin her reputation.

3633
02:51:53,330 --> 02:51:54,430
By dealing with a hacker.

3634
02:51:54,570 --> 02:51:55,690
We have VODs here.

3635
02:51:56,070 --> 02:51:56,510
So...

3636
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:56,890
Like...

3637
02:51:56,890 --> 02:51:57,990
That's such a high risk.

3638
02:52:02,380 --> 02:52:02,820
Like...

3639
02:52:02,820 --> 02:52:04,960
That's such a high risk.

3640
02:52:05,060 --> 02:52:06,700
Especially if you're in a streamer lot.

3641
02:52:06,700 --> 02:52:07,420
Like...

3642
02:52:07,420 --> 02:52:08,460
If you're in a streamer lobby.

3643
02:52:08,520 --> 02:52:09,100
And you're still...

3644
02:52:09,100 --> 02:52:09,840
If you're doing that.

3645
02:52:09,980 --> 02:52:10,580
It's just weird.

3646
02:52:14,450 --> 02:52:14,930
Yeah.

3647
02:52:15,870 --> 02:52:16,230
Like...

3648
02:52:16,230 --> 02:52:18,170
Why the fuck would you toggle on a streamer lobby?

3649
02:52:18,270 --> 02:52:18,730
At least...

3650
02:52:18,730 --> 02:52:19,470
Like...

3651
02:52:19,990 --> 02:52:20,470
Like...

3652
02:52:20,470 --> 02:52:22,190
Even if they don't know who I am.

3653
02:52:22,530 --> 02:52:23,830
You wouldn't toggle.

3654
02:52:24,150 --> 02:52:24,870
If like...

3655
02:52:24,870 --> 02:52:25,810
You see Boger.

3656
02:52:25,910 --> 02:52:27,310
Because Boger is literally like...

3657
02:52:27,310 --> 02:52:28,430
One of the representatives.

3658
02:52:28,750 --> 02:52:29,850
Of like...

3659
02:52:29,850 --> 02:52:30,310
Of...

3660
02:52:30,310 --> 02:52:30,790
Like...

3661
02:52:30,790 --> 02:52:31,230
He's like...

3662
02:52:31,230 --> 02:52:32,690
Really well known in the scene.

3663
02:52:33,030 --> 02:52:33,650
So like...

3664
02:52:33,650 --> 02:52:34,670
If you see Boger.

3665
02:52:34,750 --> 02:52:35,890
You wouldn't fucking toggle.

3666
02:52:36,070 --> 02:52:37,750
Your hacks against him.

3667
02:52:39,970 --> 02:52:40,450
Because...

3668
02:52:40,450 --> 02:52:41,310
If you're smart enough.

3669
02:52:41,370 --> 02:52:42,690
You'll fucking turn your hacks off.

3670
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:43,570
In the streamer lobby.

3671
02:52:46,850 --> 02:52:47,330
Um...

3672
02:52:47,330 --> 02:52:47,830
AlphaLed.

3673
02:52:47,890 --> 02:52:48,930
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

3674
02:52:49,050 --> 02:52:49,250
Thank you.

3675
02:52:49,530 --> 02:52:50,010
Thank you.

3676
02:52:50,830 --> 02:52:51,310
Uh...

3677
02:52:51,310 --> 02:52:52,210
I appreciate it.

3678
02:52:52,290 --> 02:52:53,430
Maybe that's why you got off.

3679
02:52:54,150 --> 02:52:54,870
No way.

3680
02:52:55,630 --> 02:52:56,070
Oh shit!

3681
02:52:56,150 --> 02:52:56,450
Guys!

3682
02:52:59,890 --> 02:53:00,750
Oh my god!

3683
02:53:00,790 --> 02:53:01,210
Guys!

3684
02:53:06,950 --> 02:53:08,090
We did it!

3685
02:53:08,370 --> 02:53:09,330
I'm not gonna...

3686
02:53:09,330 --> 02:53:09,650
Guys!

3687
02:53:09,650 --> 02:53:09,690
Guys!

3688
02:53:09,750 --> 02:53:09,930
No!

3689
02:53:10,030 --> 02:53:10,710
That was in the...

3690
02:53:10,710 --> 02:53:12,430
I'm not gonna send...

3691
02:53:14,110 --> 02:53:15,630
Wait a minute!

3692
02:53:16,290 --> 02:53:17,210
Oh my god!

3693
02:53:18,430 --> 02:53:19,790
We did it!

3694
02:53:20,570 --> 02:53:22,210
It's your chat!

3695
02:53:22,590 --> 02:53:23,510
It's your...

3696
02:53:23,510 --> 02:53:24,210
Oh my god!

3697
02:53:24,250 --> 02:53:25,150
You know that the...

3698
02:53:25,150 --> 02:53:26,710
We did it everybody!

3699
02:53:27,370 --> 02:53:28,850
We fucking did it!

3700
02:53:30,330 --> 02:53:32,910
She's not beating the allegations.

3701
02:53:34,230 --> 02:53:35,390
No I'm not!

3702
02:53:35,510 --> 02:53:35,730
Guys!

3703
02:53:35,770 --> 02:53:36,650
I'm not gonna...

3704
02:53:36,650 --> 02:53:38,170
I'm not gonna invite him.

3705
02:53:38,350 --> 02:53:38,670
Guys!

3706
02:53:38,910 --> 02:53:39,450
I'm not...

3707
02:53:39,450 --> 02:53:39,630
I'm not...

3708
02:53:39,630 --> 02:53:42,050
I'm not that fucked up everybody.

3709
02:53:42,370 --> 02:53:42,670
I...

3710
02:53:42,670 --> 02:53:43,630
I would never...

3711
02:53:45,450 --> 02:53:46,630
I would never...

3712
02:53:50,350 --> 02:53:51,470
I can't!

3713
02:53:51,490 --> 02:53:52,190
He's in queue!

3714
02:53:52,470 --> 02:53:53,770
He's still there in the duo!

3715
02:53:54,130 --> 02:53:54,630
I can't!

3716
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:56,670
I can't...

3717
02:53:56,670 --> 02:53:57,050
Guys!

3718
02:53:57,110 --> 02:53:58,670
Why are you encouraging this?

3719
02:53:59,310 --> 02:53:59,730
Guys!

3720
02:53:59,830 --> 02:54:01,950
I'm trying to be a decent person here.

3721
02:54:03,890 --> 02:54:06,070
I'm trying to be a decent person.

3722
02:54:06,150 --> 02:54:07,030
I can't believe you...

3723
02:54:07,030 --> 02:54:08,550
What happened for womankind?

3724
02:54:09,630 --> 02:54:10,330
Guys!

3725
02:54:10,390 --> 02:54:13,350
What happened for women everywhere?

3726
02:54:15,690 --> 02:54:19,370
Because I want you to hit top 500.

3727
02:54:22,990 --> 02:54:24,770
Womankind will remember.

3728
02:54:27,390 --> 02:54:27,950
Guys!

3729
02:54:28,290 --> 02:54:30,970
Will Rosa ditch the duo for you though?

3730
02:54:31,350 --> 02:54:32,710
That's a good test.

3731
02:54:33,430 --> 02:54:36,390
I could be like, hey you wanna join my stack?

3732
02:54:36,770 --> 02:54:39,210
And then we'll see if he says yes or no.

3733
02:54:39,630 --> 02:54:41,010
And it'll be like a test.

3734
02:54:41,350 --> 02:54:41,790
You know?

3735
02:54:42,210 --> 02:54:43,710
It'll be all live on...

3736
02:54:50,290 --> 02:54:53,710
We'll be like, hey you wanna join our stack?

3737
02:54:55,010 --> 02:54:56,130
But we won't...

3738
02:54:56,130 --> 02:54:57,490
We just wanna test him.

3739
02:54:57,590 --> 02:54:59,610
To see if he'll actually say yes or no.

3740
02:55:00,130 --> 02:55:00,470
Okay?

3741
02:55:00,750 --> 02:55:01,170
Let's just...

3742
02:55:01,170 --> 02:55:02,150
It's like a little test.

3743
02:55:03,010 --> 02:55:03,330
No!

3744
02:55:08,750 --> 02:55:11,470
We won't actually invite him.

3745
02:55:11,710 --> 02:55:13,890
We're playing Whiffer against him again.

3746
02:55:16,910 --> 02:55:18,190
We are...

3747
02:55:18,190 --> 02:55:18,990
Oh no!

3748
02:55:19,290 --> 02:55:20,270
We got in a different lobby.

3749
02:55:20,890 --> 02:55:21,730
It's a different lobby.

3750
02:55:21,850 --> 02:55:22,990
Oh, it's Tony Florida.

3751
02:55:23,590 --> 02:55:24,430
It's him again.

3752
02:55:26,790 --> 02:55:28,750
I think he might have reformed though.

3753
02:55:29,410 --> 02:55:32,590
Tony Florida and Diamond was a different monster.

3754
02:55:36,830 --> 02:55:42,030
I don't know.

3755
02:55:42,230 --> 02:55:43,050
Maybe he's different.

3756
02:55:43,490 --> 02:55:44,830
I feel like he's reformed.

3757
02:55:44,870 --> 02:55:45,970
I saw him in Diamond.

3758
02:55:46,690 --> 02:55:49,170
And maybe Diamond did things to him.

3759
02:55:51,650 --> 02:55:53,270
Strange Psylocke player.

3760
02:55:53,490 --> 02:55:57,350
I mean everybody's a fucking strange Psylocke player if you think about it.

3761
02:55:57,350 --> 02:55:58,650
Fine, I'll ban Psylocke.

3762
02:55:58,770 --> 02:56:00,430
As a Luna player, I'll ban Psylocke.

3763
02:56:01,990 --> 02:56:03,330
What did Tony do?

3764
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:05,810
He was really mad at our DPS.

3765
02:56:07,210 --> 02:56:08,750
And then he said a slur.

3766
02:56:09,390 --> 02:56:14,570
And then I was like, whoa!

3767
02:56:15,930 --> 02:56:17,870
That's how I remember Tony Florida.

3768
02:56:18,470 --> 02:56:19,870
But that was like Diamond.

3769
02:56:20,110 --> 02:56:23,150
That was like when I was Diamond and he was Diamond too.

3770
02:56:23,270 --> 02:56:24,850
So things could be different now.

3771
02:56:25,550 --> 02:56:26,450
You know?

3772
02:56:26,810 --> 02:56:28,210
I was like, whoa!

3773
02:56:28,630 --> 02:56:29,370
That's Florida.

3774
02:56:31,190 --> 02:56:31,610
No!

3775
02:56:32,110 --> 02:56:32,710
He...

3776
02:56:32,710 --> 02:56:34,950
I don't remember exactly what he said.

3777
02:56:35,330 --> 02:56:37,410
I just remember being like, whoa!

3778
02:56:38,430 --> 02:56:39,670
That's really it.

3779
02:56:40,330 --> 02:56:41,510
And then he swapped.

3780
02:56:41,570 --> 02:56:43,390
And then he swapped to DPS.

3781
02:56:49,370 --> 02:56:51,330
I mean, you can go strange.

3782
02:56:51,890 --> 02:56:52,510
Oh, nice.

3783
02:56:52,750 --> 02:56:52,910
Yeah.

3784
02:56:52,910 --> 02:56:53,710
Yeah.

3785
02:56:54,810 --> 02:56:55,330
Awesome.

3786
02:56:56,070 --> 02:56:57,110
Pretty sure he's better now.

3787
02:56:57,750 --> 02:56:59,290
I think it was his breaking point.

3788
02:56:59,690 --> 02:57:00,210
Legitimately.

3789
02:57:00,850 --> 02:57:02,890
I legitimately think it was like the line.

3790
02:57:03,030 --> 02:57:04,510
He like, he was at the line.

3791
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:06,270
And like...

3792
02:57:06,910 --> 02:57:08,290
And like I said, it was Diamond.

3793
02:57:14,590 --> 02:57:16,610
He had a very bad day.

3794
02:57:16,770 --> 02:57:18,890
I will not be surprised.

3795
02:57:20,730 --> 02:57:21,590
Only Hela.

3796
02:57:21,790 --> 02:57:22,750
I love Hela.

3797
02:57:26,830 --> 02:57:29,650
And then he switched to DPS.

3798
02:57:31,930 --> 02:57:33,630
Maybe he's good at DPS.

3799
02:57:33,830 --> 02:57:34,330
I don't know.

3800
02:57:34,590 --> 02:57:36,430
I remember exactly the DPS he swapped to.

3801
02:57:36,450 --> 02:57:37,430
He swapped to Moon Knight.

3802
02:57:37,690 --> 02:57:38,670
I don't know what it is.

3803
02:57:38,810 --> 02:57:41,610
Whenever a tank gets really tilted, they swap to Moon Knight.

3804
02:57:42,830 --> 02:57:44,070
It's always like that.

3805
02:57:49,390 --> 02:57:51,850
He swapped to Dawn of Moon.

3806
02:57:54,950 --> 02:57:55,930
Wait, what?

3807
02:57:56,210 --> 02:57:56,450
Portland?

3808
02:57:57,550 --> 02:57:57,990
Portland?

3809
02:57:58,510 --> 02:57:58,870
What?

3810
02:57:59,490 --> 02:57:59,850
Oh, okay.

3811
02:58:00,050 --> 02:58:00,450
Portland?

3812
02:58:01,430 --> 02:58:02,070
Portland?

3813
02:58:04,070 --> 02:58:05,610
Alright, I'll stay here.

3814
02:58:09,590 --> 02:58:11,090
Are they okay over there?

3815
02:58:12,070 --> 02:58:14,310
I don't know if I like being here.

3816
02:58:14,710 --> 02:58:17,630
I never liked being up here in general.

3817
02:58:18,270 --> 02:58:19,530
Feels scary.

3818
02:58:21,710 --> 02:58:23,010
There's a strange on me.

3819
02:58:24,270 --> 02:58:26,010
Oh my god.

3820
02:58:26,010 --> 02:58:26,770
I saw it.

3821
02:58:26,910 --> 02:58:27,250
I don't know.

3822
02:58:27,330 --> 02:58:28,310
I'm looking at my cloak.

3823
02:58:28,550 --> 02:58:29,550
Cloak, please.

3824
02:58:29,610 --> 02:58:30,630
Cloak, what?

3825
02:58:33,470 --> 02:58:34,590
That's like...

3826
02:58:35,770 --> 02:58:36,330
What?

3827
02:58:37,770 --> 02:58:38,850
What the fuck?

3828
02:58:38,870 --> 02:58:40,450
I was right next to her.

3829
02:58:40,950 --> 02:58:42,270
Oh my god.

3830
02:58:44,670 --> 02:58:46,030
Oh my god.

3831
02:58:46,670 --> 02:58:47,730
Oh no, man.

3832
02:58:47,910 --> 02:58:49,470
I have Starlord on me.

3833
02:58:51,670 --> 02:58:53,050
I'm gonna need help.

3834
02:58:54,410 --> 02:58:55,990
I need help.

3835
02:58:58,290 --> 02:58:59,170
Nice kill there.

3836
02:59:00,090 --> 02:59:01,210
Not today.

3837
02:59:02,090 --> 02:59:03,310
I'm gonna help our Luna get back.

3838
02:59:03,610 --> 02:59:03,990
Yeah.

3839
02:59:04,570 --> 02:59:06,850
I need bodyguard.

3840
02:59:08,230 --> 02:59:09,350
Oh, if you have to.

3841
02:59:09,970 --> 02:59:11,010
You win this, by the way.

3842
02:59:12,470 --> 02:59:13,250
Oh my god.

3843
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:17,190
I'm not in a good position here.

3844
02:59:19,150 --> 02:59:19,750
I'm here.

3845
02:59:19,750 --> 02:59:19,990
Keep walking.

3846
02:59:23,870 --> 02:59:24,370
She's one.

3847
02:59:25,250 --> 02:59:25,570
Starlord.

3848
02:59:25,730 --> 02:59:26,310
Starlord half.

3849
02:59:36,790 --> 02:59:37,470
Kill the tanks.

3850
02:59:37,870 --> 02:59:38,590
Starlord left side.

3851
02:59:38,750 --> 02:59:39,270
He has elusive.

3852
02:59:44,310 --> 02:59:45,130
Starlord's on me.

3853
02:59:46,290 --> 02:59:46,830
Starlord's gonna kill me.

3854
02:59:46,850 --> 02:59:47,650
I got you, I got you.

3855
02:59:47,890 --> 02:59:48,610
Starlord, Starlord half.

3856
02:59:50,070 --> 02:59:50,790
Starlord half.

3857
02:59:51,030 --> 02:59:52,430
Kill the tanks.

3858
02:59:52,590 --> 02:59:52,990
Kill the tanks.

3859
02:59:53,170 --> 02:59:53,590
Kill the tanks.

3860
02:59:53,670 --> 02:59:54,010
Kill the tanks.

3861
02:59:54,990 --> 02:59:56,530
Win me a fucking game.

3862
02:59:56,670 --> 02:59:57,750
I have Starlord on me.

3863
03:00:00,850 --> 03:00:01,730
This sucks.

3864
03:00:02,450 --> 03:00:03,030
I can't.

3865
03:00:03,210 --> 03:00:04,890
I can't get ult charge.

3866
03:00:08,170 --> 03:00:10,050
I can't get ult charge because I'm getting...

3867
03:00:13,190 --> 03:00:14,150
I'm getting died.

3868
03:00:14,570 --> 03:00:15,110
You gotta be trolling.

3869
03:00:15,210 --> 03:00:16,070
I killed two healers.

3870
03:00:16,230 --> 03:00:17,490
You couldn't win me a fucking game.

3871
03:00:17,630 --> 03:00:18,370
There he goes.

3872
03:00:18,530 --> 03:00:19,430
Fucking garbage.

3873
03:00:24,050 --> 03:00:26,630
Okay, maybe he's Starlord for him.

3874
03:00:27,030 --> 03:00:29,430
I don't think...

3875
03:00:32,130 --> 03:00:34,650
Welcome back, Tony Florida.

3876
03:00:35,470 --> 03:00:37,650
Welcome back.

3877
03:00:40,070 --> 03:00:41,330
Welcome back.

3878
03:00:46,070 --> 03:00:49,410
I don't think he's Starlord for him.

3879
03:00:49,430 --> 03:00:52,830
I don't think he...

3880
03:00:54,470 --> 03:00:55,350
I'm sorry.

3881
03:00:57,250 --> 03:00:59,630
Three, two, one, no more ults.

3882
03:01:00,390 --> 03:01:01,170
They have strange on us.

3883
03:01:01,210 --> 03:01:01,890
We have strange on us.

3884
03:01:02,490 --> 03:01:03,490
He's one, he's one, strange one.

3885
03:01:07,910 --> 03:01:08,790
Starlord, Starlord.

3886
03:01:10,810 --> 03:01:12,910
Because I don't think he's reformed.

3887
03:01:18,310 --> 03:01:19,570
Guys, it's just...

3888
03:01:19,570 --> 03:01:20,050
Guys, it's just GM things.

3889
03:01:20,470 --> 03:01:21,650
No, I think he's Eternity.

3890
03:01:21,770 --> 03:01:22,230
Guys, no.

3891
03:01:22,370 --> 03:01:22,750
It's okay.

3892
03:01:23,370 --> 03:01:24,110
It's just...

3893
03:01:24,110 --> 03:01:27,030
Guys, it's just Eternity stuff.

3894
03:01:28,950 --> 03:01:31,570
Oh my god, that's hilarious.

3895
03:01:32,610 --> 03:01:33,170
It's not...

3896
03:01:33,170 --> 03:01:34,150
Okay, it's not that.

3897
03:01:34,870 --> 03:01:37,570
He's a bad person, but like...

3898
03:01:38,910 --> 03:01:41,850
You know, I thought he was reformed, but I guess not.

3899
03:01:42,610 --> 03:01:46,050
I guess he's not reformed, guys.

3900
03:01:47,150 --> 03:01:47,670
Strange can die.

3901
03:01:48,290 --> 03:01:48,830
Strange one.

3902
03:01:50,150 --> 03:01:51,210
Nice, push, push, push, push, push.

3903
03:01:51,470 --> 03:01:52,090
Heal Mike, heal Mike.

3904
03:01:53,530 --> 03:01:54,530
Oh my god.

3905
03:01:57,090 --> 03:01:58,850
The friendliest word.

3906
03:02:03,750 --> 03:02:07,530
I'm worried he's gonna get angry again, guys.

3907
03:02:07,850 --> 03:02:10,130
What if he gets angry again?

3908
03:02:15,130 --> 03:02:15,910
I told you.

3909
03:02:16,050 --> 03:02:16,510
Now you know.

3910
03:02:16,590 --> 03:02:18,150
Now you know how the slur dropped.

3911
03:02:18,670 --> 03:02:19,090
Now...

3912
03:02:19,510 --> 03:02:20,610
Now you know.

3913
03:02:25,710 --> 03:02:26,510
I love you.

3914
03:02:26,910 --> 03:02:27,490
Stay on cart.

3915
03:02:27,950 --> 03:02:28,870
My ult's on cart.

3916
03:02:30,330 --> 03:02:30,590
Okay.

3917
03:02:31,970 --> 03:02:32,390
Nice.

3918
03:02:33,630 --> 03:02:34,390
I'm pushing up with this.

3919
03:02:36,350 --> 03:02:36,970
One more dead.

3920
03:02:38,090 --> 03:02:38,630
Strange can die.

3921
03:02:39,990 --> 03:02:40,510
Yeah.

3922
03:02:42,550 --> 03:02:43,950
Now you know.

3923
03:02:44,310 --> 03:02:45,730
You're like, he seems alright.

3924
03:02:46,170 --> 03:02:46,990
He seems alright.

3925
03:02:47,090 --> 03:02:48,690
We all thought he seemed alright.

3926
03:02:52,210 --> 03:02:53,090
He's not.

3927
03:02:53,210 --> 03:02:54,910
Yeah, he's definitely not a chill guy.

3928
03:03:03,510 --> 03:03:04,290
It's okay.

3929
03:03:04,430 --> 03:03:05,090
Now he's fine.

3930
03:03:05,210 --> 03:03:07,270
Now that we're winning, he's fine now, guys.

3931
03:03:07,370 --> 03:03:08,290
He's reformed again.

3932
03:03:08,790 --> 03:03:10,650
Now that we're winning, truly...

3933
03:03:10,650 --> 03:03:11,650
Destroy bridge.

3934
03:03:13,190 --> 03:03:14,350
Guys, we're winning now.

3935
03:03:14,670 --> 03:03:16,110
He'll be okay, I believe.

3936
03:03:17,250 --> 03:03:18,030
He's gonna get a strange ult.

3937
03:03:23,690 --> 03:03:24,410
Oh, shit.

3938
03:03:24,970 --> 03:03:25,230
This guy.

3939
03:03:25,530 --> 03:03:25,930
Just run away.

3940
03:03:27,170 --> 03:03:28,410
I can't see you over there.

3941
03:03:28,570 --> 03:03:29,370
I think Wolverine's dead.

3942
03:03:30,250 --> 03:03:30,770
Nice kill.

3943
03:03:30,890 --> 03:03:31,030
Nice kill.

3944
03:03:31,590 --> 03:03:32,490
Oh, no.

3945
03:03:34,090 --> 03:03:34,930
He's looking for ult.

3946
03:03:35,050 --> 03:03:35,410
The strange.

3947
03:03:36,290 --> 03:03:36,890
Yeah, go, go, go.

3948
03:03:40,910 --> 03:03:41,710
Strange is low.

3949
03:03:41,870 --> 03:03:42,750
Strange is low.

3950
03:03:47,430 --> 03:03:48,170
I'm 55.

3951
03:03:48,410 --> 03:03:52,910
I don't have it for...

3952
03:03:54,270 --> 03:03:55,870
Oh, my god.

3953
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:00,080
Jesus Christ.

3954
03:04:01,160 --> 03:04:01,440
Jesus.

3955
03:04:01,820 --> 03:04:02,960
I cannot heal all that.

3956
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:08,360
Oh, my god.

3957
03:04:08,380 --> 03:04:09,440
That's a lot of damage.

3958
03:04:12,240 --> 03:04:13,300
I can't see you.

3959
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:18,580
Alright, here we go.

3960
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:21,560
I have ult for strange.

3961
03:04:22,260 --> 03:04:23,200
Oh, fuck me.

3962
03:04:26,360 --> 03:04:27,920
We have strange just walking up to us.

3963
03:04:33,700 --> 03:04:36,500
Bro, why is he just walking up to us like that?

3964
03:04:36,780 --> 03:04:37,460
We're free!

3965
03:04:39,740 --> 03:04:40,600
Oh, my god.

3966
03:04:40,820 --> 03:04:42,280
Oh, my god.

3967
03:04:42,980 --> 03:04:45,420
If he looks at me one time, I'm fucked.

3968
03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:47,240
I'm so fucked.

3969
03:04:48,200 --> 03:04:48,640
Wait, wait.

3970
03:04:48,680 --> 03:04:49,340
Get strange, get strange, get strange.

3971
03:04:50,760 --> 03:04:51,900
I have to stay on my ult.

3972
03:04:51,980 --> 03:04:52,300
Stay on my ult.

3973
03:04:54,320 --> 03:04:55,000
I grabbed him.

3974
03:04:55,240 --> 03:04:55,880
Get him, get him, get him.

3975
03:04:55,940 --> 03:04:56,540
Nice, nice, nice.

3976
03:04:56,660 --> 03:04:58,480
Oh, goodbye, Wolverine.

3977
03:04:59,640 --> 03:05:00,480
I'm damage boosting this.

3978
03:05:02,780 --> 03:05:03,420
One second.

3979
03:05:07,860 --> 03:05:08,760
I can't heal you from there.

3980
03:05:15,900 --> 03:05:16,620
Nice kill.

3981
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:18,700
Oh, I cannot heal that.

3982
03:05:19,360 --> 03:05:20,760
The strange is walking up.

3983
03:05:22,320 --> 03:05:23,520
Oh, my god.

3984
03:05:24,380 --> 03:05:25,520
Okay, Wolverine, you can grab him.

3985
03:05:32,140 --> 03:05:33,020
He's looking for you.

3986
03:05:33,620 --> 03:05:34,420
Nice, nice, nice.

3987
03:05:40,910 --> 03:05:42,370
This is the last fight.

3988
03:05:45,970 --> 03:05:46,770
I have to reload.

3989
03:05:47,230 --> 03:05:48,150
You only have one support.

3990
03:05:53,610 --> 03:05:54,310
I have ult,

3991
03:05:57,990 --> 03:05:58,170
I have ult.

3992
03:05:58,170 --> 03:05:58,990
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

3993
03:05:59,790 --> 03:06:00,350
I'm ulting cart.

3994
03:06:03,150 --> 03:06:03,870
I'm alive!

3995
03:06:05,530 --> 03:06:06,250
I'm alive!

3996
03:06:09,490 --> 03:06:10,850
That's behind us, that's behind us, that's behind us.

3997
03:06:20,670 --> 03:06:21,590
Oh, no more is one.

3998
03:06:31,550 --> 03:06:33,570
Defense is gonna be much easier.

3999
03:06:34,950 --> 03:06:36,610
That was a good push, though.

4000
03:06:38,210 --> 03:06:40,270
Loki, please drop down.

4001
03:06:41,930 --> 03:06:43,250
Oh, my god.

4002
03:06:44,510 --> 03:06:47,290
This is the laggiest server I've ever played.

4003
03:06:47,430 --> 03:06:48,410
This is East Coast.

4004
03:06:51,230 --> 03:06:53,310
Welcome to East Coast.

4005
03:07:03,530 --> 03:07:04,790
Welcome to East...

4006
03:07:04,790 --> 03:07:05,990
This is why I removed East Coast.

4007
03:07:06,110 --> 03:07:08,270
This is why I cut the East Coast out of...

4008
03:07:08,270 --> 03:07:09,830
That time when...

4009
03:07:09,830 --> 03:07:11,590
That very first game...

4010
03:07:11,590 --> 03:07:14,290
When I got Luna ult...

4011
03:07:14,290 --> 03:07:16,490
And it popped off in my screen...

4012
03:07:17,090 --> 03:07:19,150
But it didn't, it didn't go off.

4013
03:07:19,290 --> 03:07:20,390
And I was like, excuse me?

4014
03:07:24,550 --> 03:07:25,070
That...

4015
03:07:25,070 --> 03:07:28,010
That made me mad.

4016
03:07:32,070 --> 03:07:33,390
Florida is in East Coast, right?

4017
03:07:36,010 --> 03:07:37,470
Nothing was lost then.

4018
03:07:39,130 --> 03:07:40,670
Yes, okay, yep, nothing.

4019
03:07:44,650 --> 03:07:46,590
We're gonna cut off the dick.

4020
03:07:47,970 --> 03:07:49,470
Because Florida is America's dick, right?

4021
03:07:50,170 --> 03:07:52,430
Oh, my god, Florida, man.

4022
03:07:53,010 --> 03:07:54,290
Oh, my god!

4023
03:07:57,010 --> 03:07:57,990
What the fuck?

4024
03:07:57,990 --> 03:07:58,430
What the fuck?

4025
03:07:58,530 --> 03:07:59,130
Is it in?

4026
03:07:59,610 --> 03:08:00,990
Is that American Geography?

4027
03:08:02,730 --> 03:08:03,810
That's American Geography.

4028
03:08:08,970 --> 03:08:10,170
That's Tony.

4029
03:08:11,730 --> 03:08:13,150
That's Tony.

4030
03:08:15,190 --> 03:08:17,550
Please, just a little bit.

4031
03:08:19,630 --> 03:08:22,970
Oh, we're Wolverine.

4032
03:08:26,130 --> 03:08:27,490
There's a Starlord on you.

4033
03:08:34,170 --> 03:08:35,850
Oh, my god, my frames are dropping, though.

4034
03:08:36,570 --> 03:08:37,770
Oh, my frames are dropping.

4035
03:08:38,670 --> 03:08:40,030
My frames are actually dropping.

4036
03:08:43,330 --> 03:08:44,130
This is bad.

4037
03:08:44,750 --> 03:08:46,590
This is bad, this is very hard to heal right now.

4038
03:08:47,510 --> 03:08:48,670
This is very hard to heal.

4039
03:08:52,830 --> 03:08:53,610
Oh, my god!

4040
03:08:54,050 --> 03:08:55,430
This is actually very hard to heal.

4041
03:08:55,610 --> 03:08:55,990
No!

4042
03:08:58,730 --> 03:08:59,130
Oh!

4043
03:09:01,770 --> 03:09:02,170
No!

4044
03:09:04,510 --> 03:09:06,230
I can't heal the frames!

4045
03:09:09,510 --> 03:09:11,610
Oh, we don't.

4046
03:09:13,230 --> 03:09:14,350
Oh, no!

4047
03:09:15,470 --> 03:09:16,390
Not the frames!

4048
03:09:17,750 --> 03:09:21,330
Just because I wanted to cut off East Coast!

4049
03:09:24,650 --> 03:09:29,830
The server was like, no, no, no, we're not cutting East Coast out.

4050
03:09:30,790 --> 03:09:32,970
Because we had the Tony freak out, I'm too scared.

4051
03:09:36,090 --> 03:09:39,590
Because I don't want Tony to freak out, guys.

4052
03:09:40,190 --> 03:09:42,470
I don't want him to freak out.

4053
03:09:44,350 --> 03:09:46,210
I have a Xayah on me again.

4054
03:09:46,810 --> 03:09:47,810
I'm going to cart, I'm going to cart.

4055
03:09:52,630 --> 03:09:53,670
That's good for you, Rhett.

4056
03:09:55,230 --> 03:09:56,170
Behind, behind, behind!

4057
03:09:58,910 --> 03:09:59,730
Oh, no!

4058
03:10:00,150 --> 03:10:01,330
Magneto got both supports.

4059
03:10:03,250 --> 03:10:04,530
You have no supports.

4060
03:10:05,270 --> 03:10:06,690
Yeah, I'm chilling.

4061
03:10:07,630 --> 03:10:07,890
Okay.

4062
03:10:10,090 --> 03:10:12,690
I don't think they didn't use support ults, either.

4063
03:10:12,890 --> 03:10:16,410
Did someone also break fucking reasons to walk in?

4064
03:10:19,030 --> 03:10:19,590
Okay.

4065
03:10:23,780 --> 03:10:25,560
Don't worry, Strange!

4066
03:10:25,660 --> 03:10:27,820
Peek me, because I'm too scared!

4067
03:10:28,160 --> 03:10:28,640
Oh, my god.

4068
03:10:29,240 --> 03:10:30,120
Oh, my god.

4069
03:10:32,440 --> 03:10:33,160
I can't see.

4070
03:10:33,180 --> 03:10:33,900
I can't see you, Strange!

4071
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:35,800
Yeah, yeah.

4072
03:10:38,980 --> 03:10:39,780
I'm angry.

4073
03:10:40,140 --> 03:10:41,160
Are they using both support ults, here?

4074
03:10:42,240 --> 03:10:48,800
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear!

4075
03:10:49,960 --> 03:10:50,360
Fear!

4076
03:10:50,460 --> 03:10:51,340
So much fear!

4077
03:10:55,220 --> 03:11:00,240
So much fear.

4078
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:03,400
So much fear.

4079
03:11:05,260 --> 03:11:07,960
Can you guys ask our second DPS to...

4080
03:11:09,480 --> 03:11:11,740
What do you want our second DPS to do?

4081
03:11:11,820 --> 03:11:12,980
Look what he's doing.

4082
03:11:16,100 --> 03:11:17,600
What do you want him to do?

4083
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:20,880
He's jumping around!

4084
03:11:24,280 --> 03:11:25,920
I don't have anything for that.

4085
03:11:27,940 --> 03:11:29,240
I have a Strange on me.

4086
03:11:30,300 --> 03:11:32,060
Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to help you.

4087
03:11:33,940 --> 03:11:34,800
I'll burn him more.

4088
03:11:35,540 --> 03:11:37,160
I can't, I couldn't see him for a few seconds.

4089
03:11:47,860 --> 03:11:49,200
Oh, my god, please.

4090
03:12:00,390 --> 03:12:03,450
Oh, there's a Strange behind us!

4091
03:12:05,050 --> 03:12:05,950
Oh, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

4092
03:12:08,810 --> 03:12:09,890
I'm damage boosting this.

4093
03:12:15,550 --> 03:12:19,970
Star, more star, more star, more star, more star, more star.

4094
03:12:21,260 --> 03:12:22,890
Oh, you're fucking annoying.

4095
03:12:25,430 --> 03:12:26,690
Tell me Florida.

4096
03:12:28,090 --> 03:12:30,130
Hey, listen, I'm sheltering here.

4097
03:12:30,590 --> 03:12:31,030
It's important.

4098
03:12:31,470 --> 03:12:32,550
Oh, shit!

4099
03:12:34,110 --> 03:12:35,430
Oh, yeah, bro!

4100
03:12:39,420 --> 03:12:41,150
Guys, it's just a...

4101
03:12:41,150 --> 03:12:42,270
Oh, Florida.

4102
03:12:44,090 --> 03:12:46,590
Oh, Florida, man.

4103
03:12:52,410 --> 03:12:54,830
There's a Starlord on us.

4104
03:12:59,610 --> 03:13:00,770
I'm dead.

4105
03:13:01,510 --> 03:13:02,430
We still have Cloak.

4106
03:13:05,970 --> 03:13:07,070
Only Cloak heals.

4107
03:13:10,210 --> 03:13:11,790
I'm dead, we have two kills.

4108
03:13:12,570 --> 03:13:14,030
If we touch this, we win this.

4109
03:13:14,370 --> 03:13:15,250
Do anything we can.

4110
03:13:16,670 --> 03:13:17,690
Our Starlord is poking him.

4111
03:13:18,470 --> 03:13:20,250
Iron Fist, Iron Fist, you gotta fudge, bro.

4112
03:13:22,770 --> 03:13:24,530
I'm healing our Iron Fist right now.

4113
03:13:28,670 --> 03:13:33,770
We still have one more fight, so we should kill.

4114
03:13:36,050 --> 03:13:37,490
I'm gonna take damage, we need support.

4115
03:13:37,850 --> 03:13:38,850
Yeah, I have 86.

4116
03:13:44,430 --> 03:13:45,770
I'm opening a portal.

4117
03:13:48,050 --> 03:13:50,350
Hey, mate, TP on you, Punisher, I don't care.

4118
03:13:55,310 --> 03:13:56,490
There's definitely a Starlord ult.

4119
03:13:57,510 --> 03:13:58,490
Get out, get out, get out.

4120
03:13:58,530 --> 03:13:59,550
I got ult, I got ult, I got ult.

4121
03:14:00,790 --> 03:14:01,670
Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive.

4122
03:14:01,690 --> 03:14:02,590
Starlord one, Starlord one!

4123
03:14:03,890 --> 03:14:04,930
I can't get to you, Punisher.

4124
03:14:09,230 --> 03:14:11,430
I'm gonna ult point, I'm gonna ult over.

4125
03:14:12,210 --> 03:14:12,810
I'm going point.

4126
03:14:12,810 --> 03:14:14,410
They're gonna Starlord ult after this.

4127
03:14:15,570 --> 03:14:16,590
They don't, they don't.

4128
03:14:17,130 --> 03:14:17,450
Oh, they don't?

4129
03:14:17,530 --> 03:14:17,730
Okay.

4130
03:14:19,890 --> 03:14:20,610
I'm on point, I'm on point.

4131
03:14:22,230 --> 03:14:23,170
Ult's gone, ult's gone.

4132
03:14:23,910 --> 03:14:24,490
Good try.

4133
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:29,920
Oh, no!

4134
03:14:39,810 --> 03:14:42,590
I don't think we're gonna... I'm leaving, goodbye!

4135
03:14:44,590 --> 03:14:46,070
I'm leaving, goodbye!

4136
03:14:47,610 --> 03:14:48,050
Goodbye.

4137
03:14:48,050 --> 03:14:48,090
Goodbye.

4138
03:14:49,810 --> 03:14:50,910
Is he gonna live?

4139
03:14:57,480 --> 03:14:58,680
Alright, here we go.

4140
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:01,280
Okay, no, we can't die.

4141
03:15:01,720 --> 03:15:03,000
Yeah, we take an early fight here.

4142
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:07,060
Yeah, we... if we take an early fight, we can have like two fights here.

4143
03:15:07,100 --> 03:15:08,580
Guys, we take an early fight here, I think.

4144
03:15:10,620 --> 03:15:10,940
Yeah.

4145
03:15:11,340 --> 03:15:12,580
Yeah, guys, let's take an early fight.

4146
03:15:13,700 --> 03:15:15,400
Yeah, guys, let's take an early fight here, I think.

4147
03:15:16,300 --> 03:15:17,220
Starlord one, Starlord's low!

4148
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:22,040
I see you, I see you.

4149
03:15:25,840 --> 03:15:27,820
Wait, that's good, I don't think we need to use anything.

4150
03:15:28,080 --> 03:15:28,280
Yeah, yeah.

4151
03:15:29,760 --> 03:15:31,180
We don't need to use anything, I think.

4152
03:15:31,260 --> 03:15:32,080
Unless we can get picks.

4153
03:15:34,040 --> 03:15:34,720
Okay, heal me now.

4154
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:36,160
Three, two, one, let's go.

4155
03:15:37,060 --> 03:15:37,380
Alright.

4156
03:15:38,460 --> 03:15:39,960
Oh, I can't heal that.

4157
03:15:42,080 --> 03:15:42,960
You need to.

4158
03:15:46,380 --> 03:15:48,960
I don't know if I can heal a fucking rock!

4159
03:15:52,120 --> 03:15:55,360
I think it's like, you need to, and I'm like, how?!

4160
03:15:55,360 --> 03:15:56,840
That's a rock!

4161
03:15:57,780 --> 03:15:58,760
I have all your...

4162
03:16:00,040 --> 03:16:01,500
I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing.

4163
03:16:02,340 --> 03:16:04,640
Oh, I can't, sorry.

4164
03:16:07,560 --> 03:16:09,060
Luna's out of ult, Luna's out of ult too.

4165
03:16:12,280 --> 03:16:13,340
I'm dead to the Magneto.

4166
03:16:15,800 --> 03:16:16,420
Magneto's on me.

4167
03:16:20,080 --> 03:16:20,980
No more one.

4168
03:16:21,880 --> 03:16:23,400
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

4169
03:16:23,400 --> 03:16:24,020
They're gonna stand it.

4170
03:16:26,800 --> 03:16:27,280
Oh my god.

4171
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:29,800
I'm alive, I'm alive.

4172
03:16:31,860 --> 03:16:32,300
Magneto?

4173
03:16:32,460 --> 03:16:33,040
Hit this guy.

4174
03:16:33,260 --> 03:16:33,840
Fucking scale.

4175
03:16:37,620 --> 03:16:39,100
Dude, he's still mild?

4176
03:16:40,120 --> 03:16:40,560
Nice.

4177
03:16:44,560 --> 03:16:45,980
Oh my god, let's go!

4178
03:16:46,020 --> 03:16:46,320
GG.

4179
03:16:47,920 --> 03:16:50,000
He's like, well, you're gonna have to heal it.

4180
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:51,240
I'm like, that's a rock!

4181
03:16:51,540 --> 03:16:52,520
How do I heal a rock?

4182
03:16:54,460 --> 03:16:58,440
How do I heal a fucking giant meteorite?

4183
03:16:58,880 --> 03:17:01,820
Like, I don't know what he wants from me.

4184
03:17:07,400 --> 03:17:09,640
Yay, we saved the stream.

4185
03:17:13,700 --> 03:17:16,180
We saved the stream, guys.

4186
03:17:17,180 --> 03:17:19,040
I didn't get yelled at.

4187
03:17:19,160 --> 03:17:20,320
Let's fucking go.

4188
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:22,420
Oh my god.

4189
03:17:25,420 --> 03:17:28,860
No, I accidentally pressed escape.

4190
03:17:31,060 --> 03:17:32,660
Zeon, thank you for the tier one sub.

4191
03:17:32,720 --> 03:17:33,860
Thank you, loyally.

4192
03:17:34,760 --> 03:17:36,400
And Arm, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

4193
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:37,500
Thank you.

4194
03:17:37,940 --> 03:17:39,280
VOD is saved.

4195
03:17:39,520 --> 03:17:40,220
How many more?

4196
03:17:40,660 --> 03:17:41,400
It's like...

4197
03:17:44,300 --> 03:17:44,780
171.

4198
03:17:45,180 --> 03:17:46,340
Oh my god, it went up three points.

4199
03:17:46,400 --> 03:17:48,540
It went up three points since I started the stream.

4200
03:17:48,660 --> 03:17:49,480
That's so fucked.

4201
03:17:49,660 --> 03:17:51,760
That's actually so fucked.

4202
03:17:51,840 --> 03:17:52,760
It's so fast.

4203
03:17:53,140 --> 03:17:54,240
Oh my god.

4204
03:17:56,260 --> 03:17:57,460
It's so fast.

4205
03:17:57,640 --> 03:17:58,220
I'm like...

4206
03:17:58,220 --> 03:18:00,000
Yeah, I'm like two games away.

4207
03:18:00,820 --> 03:18:02,040
Yeah, I'm two games away.

4208
03:18:03,160 --> 03:18:04,120
But like...

4209
03:18:04,120 --> 03:18:05,580
I think like...

4210
03:18:05,580 --> 03:18:07,340
250 is the cutoff.

4211
03:18:07,820 --> 03:18:08,860
I want 200 points.

4212
03:18:08,920 --> 03:18:09,360
Yeah, I wanna...

4213
03:18:09,360 --> 03:18:11,400
I wanna like at least get 200 points.

4214
03:18:11,560 --> 03:18:12,380
And then...

4215
03:18:12,380 --> 03:18:13,660
Let's see how it goes.

4216
03:18:14,280 --> 03:18:16,060
I mean, it's been pretty good so far.

4217
03:18:16,400 --> 03:18:17,700
We've been playing...

4218
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:18,560
Our record's alright.

4219
03:18:19,160 --> 03:18:20,540
I feel like I'm gonna jinx it.

4220
03:18:20,840 --> 03:18:23,420
We literally lost because we had to fight Rosa.

4221
03:18:24,060 --> 03:18:24,580
We literally...

4222
03:18:25,540 --> 03:18:28,040
We had to fight Rosa.

4223
03:18:28,520 --> 03:18:30,440
That's like the only reason we lost.

4224
03:18:30,920 --> 03:18:31,360
Honestly.

4225
03:18:32,380 --> 03:18:34,120
Any other time, it's been okay.

4226
03:18:37,460 --> 03:18:38,580
It's been alright.

4227
03:18:39,860 --> 03:18:41,280
Rosa solo right now?

4228
03:18:41,360 --> 03:18:41,820
Rosa good.

4229
03:18:45,360 --> 03:18:47,320
Oh my god, is it time?

4230
03:18:47,460 --> 03:18:48,380
Do we poach Rosa?

4231
03:18:48,760 --> 03:18:48,920
Is it?

4232
03:18:53,320 --> 03:18:53,960
I...

4233
03:18:53,960 --> 03:18:54,360
Wait.

4234
03:18:54,760 --> 03:18:56,220
I had it, Rosa.

4235
03:18:57,520 --> 03:18:59,760
Were you spectating, Rosa?

4236
03:19:01,160 --> 03:19:02,100
Is he...

4237
03:19:02,100 --> 03:19:02,820
Is he legit?

4238
03:19:05,020 --> 03:19:06,660
Just to be sure.

4239
03:19:07,940 --> 03:19:09,580
Before I poach him.

4240
03:19:09,880 --> 03:19:10,960
Just to be sure.

4241
03:19:15,820 --> 03:19:17,500
Oh, he's rank 16?

4242
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:22,340
Apparently, he is a fursie.

4243
03:19:22,520 --> 03:19:25,560
I have no idea who he is.

4244
03:19:25,900 --> 03:19:26,600
I'm like...

4245
03:19:26,600 --> 03:19:28,220
I'm like the Flash meme.

4246
03:19:28,500 --> 03:19:31,580
I'm like the Flash meme where like...

4247
03:19:31,580 --> 03:19:32,340
What is it called?

4248
03:19:32,440 --> 03:19:34,200
Lex Luthor took his body.

4249
03:19:34,680 --> 03:19:37,140
Took Flash's body and he takes off his mask.

4250
03:19:37,380 --> 03:19:39,540
And then he's like, I don't know who he is.

4251
03:19:39,860 --> 03:19:41,680
You're just like, bro, he's a fursie.

4252
03:19:41,760 --> 03:19:42,720
And I'm like, who?

4253
03:19:47,800 --> 03:19:49,640
Oh, shit.

4254
03:19:51,360 --> 03:19:52,200
Yeah.

4255
03:19:52,460 --> 03:19:53,440
Alright, it's time.

4256
03:19:54,820 --> 03:19:55,740
We...

4257
03:19:56,720 --> 03:19:59,780
I could add him to the stack.

4258
03:20:01,880 --> 03:20:03,340
Like, I friended...

4259
03:20:03,340 --> 03:20:06,420
I friended him after he happened here.

4260
03:20:12,780 --> 03:20:15,580
Ruthless businesswoman.

4261
03:20:18,420 --> 03:20:20,820
Boog is like, no.

4262
03:20:21,840 --> 03:20:23,880
Instant no.

4263
03:20:25,980 --> 03:20:28,460
For women everywhere.

4264
03:20:33,220 --> 03:20:34,620
But...

4265
03:20:34,620 --> 03:20:35,960
But women.

4266
03:20:37,440 --> 03:20:41,580
But if he is cheating, then we lose aura.

4267
03:20:47,380 --> 03:20:49,520
The call of the rancorous.

4268
03:20:51,320 --> 03:20:52,460
Not the aura.

4269
03:20:52,620 --> 03:20:54,020
He's right, though.

4270
03:20:55,620 --> 03:20:56,820
That's why I asked Boog.

4271
03:20:56,820 --> 03:20:58,840
I was like, do you think he's cheating?

4272
03:21:04,860 --> 03:21:06,960
Alright, Boog was like, no.

4273
03:21:07,200 --> 03:21:08,080
Alright, we won't.

4274
03:21:08,120 --> 03:21:08,940
That's what I'm saying.

4275
03:21:09,240 --> 03:21:11,720
Like, because I was like, I don't know if he is cheating or not.

4276
03:21:11,720 --> 03:21:12,620
Because...

4277
03:21:14,920 --> 03:21:16,200
Because like...

4278
03:21:19,280 --> 03:21:22,120
The reputation of fucking playing with a cheater.

4279
03:21:23,180 --> 03:21:25,140
You lose more than you gain.

4280
03:21:25,580 --> 03:21:26,660
So I had to make sure.

4281
03:21:27,420 --> 03:21:27,640
Yeah.

4282
03:21:29,140 --> 03:21:32,580
He's not even playing with the other person anymore.

4283
03:21:33,080 --> 03:21:34,980
How am I home record when he's solo?

4284
03:21:38,100 --> 03:21:39,360
I waited.

4285
03:21:40,640 --> 03:21:40,960
Guys.

4286
03:21:41,740 --> 03:21:43,080
I waited.

4287
03:21:44,560 --> 03:21:46,280
So he was alone.

4288
03:21:46,660 --> 03:21:48,140
That's so much worse.

4289
03:21:48,460 --> 03:21:49,200
Guys, sorry.

4290
03:21:49,360 --> 03:21:50,780
That's actually a lot worse.

4291
03:21:51,260 --> 03:21:51,720
I was like...

4292
03:21:53,640 --> 03:21:55,680
You are awful.

4293
03:21:57,920 --> 03:22:00,560
That's so fucked up.

4294
03:22:01,720 --> 03:22:05,340
Guys, I didn't add him to the stack, guys.

4295
03:22:05,860 --> 03:22:07,420
I didn't add him.

4296
03:22:10,020 --> 03:22:13,460
For womankind everywhere, I didn't do anything bad.

4297
03:22:13,800 --> 03:22:16,420
That's so bad, actually.

4298
03:22:20,540 --> 03:22:21,920
Oh my god.

4299
03:22:23,140 --> 03:22:24,060
Wait, what did he say?

4300
03:22:24,980 --> 03:22:26,280
How many points do you have?

4301
03:22:26,400 --> 03:22:27,160
I have...

4302
03:22:27,160 --> 03:22:29,480
I'm at...

4303
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:32,380
Where am I at?

4304
03:22:32,520 --> 03:22:33,240
I don't even remember.

4305
03:22:33,440 --> 03:22:34,900
I'm at...

4306
03:22:35,840 --> 03:22:36,480
134.

4307
03:22:36,480 --> 03:22:36,740
Anyway.

4308
03:22:38,480 --> 03:22:42,000
It's just like my Japanese comments.

4309
03:22:47,240 --> 03:22:48,600
Who is that guy, anyway?

4310
03:22:48,700 --> 03:22:49,480
He's like, what?

4311
03:22:49,720 --> 03:22:50,540
His name is...

4312
03:22:51,240 --> 03:22:52,060
What's his name?

4313
03:22:55,180 --> 03:22:56,300
Alfred A.

4314
03:22:56,360 --> 03:22:56,800
Fersi?

4315
03:22:57,160 --> 03:22:58,680
He must be on the leaderboard, right?

4316
03:22:58,840 --> 03:22:59,920
He's 16th, right?

4317
03:23:00,020 --> 03:23:00,540
This guy.

4318
03:23:01,140 --> 03:23:01,840
This is him.

4319
03:23:02,520 --> 03:23:03,300
Holy shit.

4320
03:23:03,440 --> 03:23:04,360
409 points.

4321
03:23:04,420 --> 03:23:05,540
He's fucking insane.

4322
03:23:05,540 --> 03:23:07,560
Oh, he's a Starlord player.

4323
03:23:09,800 --> 03:23:11,280
He's a Starlord main.

4324
03:23:12,420 --> 03:23:13,860
What is his...

4325
03:23:13,860 --> 03:23:16,840
Chaos streak, critical strike hits, critical hit rate.

4326
03:23:17,080 --> 03:23:17,880
13%.

4327
03:23:17,880 --> 03:23:19,000
That's pretty good.

4328
03:23:19,540 --> 03:23:21,440
That's actually pretty good.

4329
03:23:24,280 --> 03:23:26,360
13% is actually insane.

4330
03:23:27,440 --> 03:23:29,800
80% best accuracy.

4331
03:23:30,240 --> 03:23:31,460
Because it's critical hit.

4332
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:32,300
It's like headshots.

4333
03:23:34,060 --> 03:23:35,700
Yeah, the fact that like...

4334
03:23:35,700 --> 03:23:36,400
Yeah, that's actually...

4335
03:23:36,400 --> 03:23:37,220
That's insane.

4336
03:23:37,380 --> 03:23:38,180
Holy fuck.

4337
03:23:38,280 --> 03:23:38,920
13%?

4338
03:23:39,840 --> 03:23:44,740
If you see a Widowmaker with 13% critical hit, they're hacking.

4339
03:23:45,420 --> 03:23:46,460
But it's not Widowmaker.

4340
03:23:46,840 --> 03:23:48,540
It's not like...

4341
03:23:48,540 --> 03:23:49,560
Like, I know like...

4342
03:23:49,940 --> 03:23:55,540
Widow mains, if they have like critical hit accuracy that high, it's usually they're hacking.

4343
03:23:55,740 --> 03:23:56,160
But I...

4344
03:23:56,160 --> 03:23:57,220
I don't know.

4345
03:23:57,360 --> 03:23:58,760
I don't know about Marble Rivals.

4346
03:23:59,020 --> 03:24:01,640
I don't know the stat line for Marble Rivals, to be fair.

4347
03:24:02,300 --> 03:24:03,420
Marble Rivals is different.

4348
03:24:03,560 --> 03:24:04,720
It's a different stat line.

4349
03:24:08,900 --> 03:24:10,000
Like, Widow...

4350
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:10,810
Yeah, it's like...

4351
03:24:11,380 --> 03:24:13,720
There's only a select few where like...

4352
03:24:14,920 --> 03:24:18,720
Like, you know, like there could be like Overwatch pros that are...

4353
03:24:19,380 --> 03:24:20,300
That have like...

4354
03:24:20,300 --> 03:24:23,600
That's how like people tell a Widowmaker that's hacking.

4355
03:24:23,960 --> 03:24:26,840
Which is basically like you just look at the stat line.

4356
03:24:27,720 --> 03:24:29,460
Of like their critical hit accuracy.

4357
03:24:29,600 --> 03:24:31,100
So 13% is like really good.

4358
03:24:31,860 --> 03:24:32,360
In general.

4359
03:24:32,640 --> 03:24:33,560
It's just good in general.

4360
03:24:34,720 --> 03:24:35,380
Oh my gosh.

4361
03:24:35,660 --> 03:24:36,240
There's so many.

4362
03:24:36,340 --> 03:24:37,120
One above all.

4363
03:24:37,220 --> 03:24:38,300
I'm just a little guy.

4364
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:40,120
I'm just a little Eternity Girl.

4365
03:24:47,290 --> 03:24:49,010
I can play Mantis.

4366
03:24:51,010 --> 03:24:52,010
You can have Luna.

4367
03:24:57,770 --> 03:24:58,870
I'll play Hulk.

4368
03:25:00,930 --> 03:25:03,430
I'm just surprised Kefri didn't quit another...

4369
03:25:03,430 --> 03:25:06,070
Quit Overwatch again for a new game.

4370
03:25:09,850 --> 03:25:11,390
It's not shots fired.

4371
03:25:11,530 --> 03:25:11,990
It's like...

4372
03:25:17,410 --> 03:25:18,370
It's usually...

4373
03:25:18,370 --> 03:25:20,250
A lot of Overwatch players are like that.

4374
03:25:20,610 --> 03:25:21,170
They're like...

4375
03:25:21,170 --> 03:25:21,850
Wow, interesting.

4376
03:25:21,990 --> 03:25:23,050
I'm gonna...

4377
03:25:23,930 --> 03:25:27,650
I'm gonna like quit Overwatch to play X game or something.

4378
03:25:27,810 --> 03:25:28,710
Do they have any one-trick?

4379
03:25:28,710 --> 03:25:32,090
So I'm surprised that he didn't do that again for Marvel Rivals.

4380
03:25:32,110 --> 03:25:34,090
No one recognizes Luna one-trick.

4381
03:25:34,310 --> 03:25:35,210
But that's about it.

4382
03:25:38,990 --> 03:25:41,310
I think we just ban like Hawkeye or one of the healers.

4383
03:25:41,490 --> 03:25:42,250
They're banning Hawkeye.

4384
03:25:42,310 --> 03:25:44,730
Jonami, thank you for the five gifted subs.

4385
03:25:44,830 --> 03:25:45,270
Thank you, thank you.

4386
03:25:47,070 --> 03:25:49,290
Dragonfood, thank you for the tier three subs.

4387
03:25:49,410 --> 03:25:50,310
Thank you, thank you.

4388
03:25:50,370 --> 03:25:51,470
I really appreciate it.

4389
03:25:52,090 --> 03:25:53,110
Thank you so much.

4390
03:25:53,390 --> 03:25:54,270
They ban Iron Man though.

4391
03:25:54,370 --> 03:25:55,050
Thank God.

4392
03:25:56,090 --> 03:25:57,110
They still have Hulk though.

4393
03:25:57,190 --> 03:25:57,970
So like...

4394
03:25:57,970 --> 03:25:59,290
That's not the best for me.

4395
03:26:03,180 --> 03:26:03,900
I mean...

4396
03:26:03,900 --> 03:26:04,300
Widowmakers?

4397
03:26:06,040 --> 03:26:06,740
What's it called?

4398
03:26:07,360 --> 03:26:08,680
Black Widow is so bad.

4399
03:26:09,420 --> 03:26:10,140
Like her...

4400
03:26:10,140 --> 03:26:13,880
She's only good if you have a Mantis that fucking pockets you all the time.

4401
03:26:16,100 --> 03:26:18,540
That's the only reason to go...

4402
03:26:19,440 --> 03:26:19,880
Widow.

4403
03:26:19,980 --> 03:26:20,660
Black Widow.

4404
03:26:21,100 --> 03:26:22,140
But like...

4405
03:26:22,140 --> 03:26:23,680
A Mantis sometimes doesn't do that.

4406
03:26:23,780 --> 03:26:24,680
So like...

4407
03:26:24,680 --> 03:26:25,400
Yeah.

4408
03:26:25,820 --> 03:26:26,980
I fucking hate this map.

4409
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:28,360
I wish they'd take this map out of rotation.

4410
03:26:28,800 --> 03:26:30,960
I hope we get new maps though.

4411
03:26:31,080 --> 03:26:32,500
I know we're getting four new heroes.

4412
03:26:33,240 --> 03:26:34,020
But like...

4413
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:34,540
I hope...

4414
03:26:34,540 --> 03:26:36,020
I'm so tired of this map.

4415
03:26:36,140 --> 03:26:38,560
I need more maps so I get to see less of this one.

4416
03:26:40,840 --> 03:26:41,940
That's really it.

4417
03:26:42,220 --> 03:26:44,320
I just want less of this fucking map.

4418
03:26:46,280 --> 03:26:47,000
She's bad.

4419
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:48,320
Cause then like when you have a...

4420
03:26:48,320 --> 03:26:49,460
You have to fucking...

4421
03:26:49,460 --> 03:26:50,380
Peel for this...

4422
03:26:50,380 --> 03:26:50,820
The Widow.

4423
03:26:51,060 --> 03:26:51,460
And everything.

4424
03:26:51,600 --> 03:26:52,420
Cause she has...

4425
03:26:52,420 --> 03:26:55,720
Like at least Widowmaker she has her grapples to get out of situation.

4426
03:26:56,260 --> 03:26:57,140
Black Widow...

4427
03:26:57,140 --> 03:26:58,180
She doesn't have a grapple.

4428
03:26:58,380 --> 03:27:00,200
All she has is her fucking...

4429
03:27:00,200 --> 03:27:01,000
Thing that...

4430
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:02,200
Beats people...

4431
03:27:02,200 --> 03:27:02,500
Off.

4432
03:27:03,320 --> 03:27:04,100
That like...

4433
03:27:04,100 --> 03:27:05,220
That like...

4434
03:27:05,220 --> 03:27:06,540
You know...

4435
03:27:06,540 --> 03:27:07,780
Throw them away.

4436
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:09,980
Her kick.

4437
03:27:10,100 --> 03:27:10,400
Yeah.

4438
03:27:11,580 --> 03:27:13,240
Like she just...

4439
03:27:13,240 --> 03:27:14,880
She can just kick and that's it.

4440
03:27:15,460 --> 03:27:16,160
She gotta jump.

4441
03:27:16,280 --> 03:27:16,380
Yeah.

4442
03:27:16,580 --> 03:27:18,140
Like where the fuck am I jumping?

4443
03:27:18,840 --> 03:27:19,060
What?

4444
03:27:21,360 --> 03:27:22,620
Where did she go?

4445
03:27:23,300 --> 03:27:23,920
Where did...

4446
03:27:23,920 --> 03:27:24,540
What?

4447
03:27:25,260 --> 03:27:25,900
Where did...

4448
03:27:25,900 --> 03:27:27,800
Where did our stream go?

4449
03:27:30,160 --> 03:27:31,620
I slept him.

4450
03:27:31,700 --> 03:27:31,960
I slept him.

4451
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:35,280
Where did...

4452
03:27:35,280 --> 03:27:37,020
Where did my stream go?

4453
03:27:37,780 --> 03:27:38,580
Where did he go?

4454
03:27:39,040 --> 03:27:39,760
Oh yeah!

4455
03:27:40,320 --> 03:27:41,840
Where the fuck did he go?

4456
03:27:42,420 --> 03:27:42,980
That was strange.

4457
03:27:43,380 --> 03:27:44,160
I don't know where the bubble was.

4458
03:27:44,900 --> 03:27:45,160
Yeah.

4459
03:27:45,860 --> 03:27:46,300
Oh!

4460
03:27:47,140 --> 03:27:48,240
I'm so unlucky.

4461
03:27:49,860 --> 03:27:50,600
I dropped there.

4462
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:51,440
Wolverine's one.

4463
03:27:51,580 --> 03:27:52,340
No, no, no, no, no.

4464
03:27:52,700 --> 03:27:53,280
I'm dead.

4465
03:27:56,810 --> 03:27:57,530
I slept him.

4466
03:27:57,630 --> 03:27:57,890
I slept him.

4467
03:27:59,090 --> 03:27:59,650
He's one.

4468
03:27:59,750 --> 03:28:00,010
He's one.

4469
03:28:00,610 --> 03:28:01,550
Wolverine's coming in though.

4470
03:28:02,870 --> 03:28:03,730
Oh my god.

4471
03:28:03,810 --> 03:28:04,510
He's grappling!

4472
03:28:06,750 --> 03:28:07,570
Oh my god.

4473
03:28:07,570 --> 03:28:10,350
I think we might have to die no more.

4474
03:28:10,430 --> 03:28:12,050
I'm leaving you by the way.

4475
03:28:13,690 --> 03:28:14,810
Bye no more.

4476
03:28:18,290 --> 03:28:19,010
Alright.

4477
03:28:20,990 --> 03:28:22,370
He went...

4478
03:28:22,370 --> 03:28:23,330
He went home.

4479
03:28:23,850 --> 03:28:27,610
That was such a crazy strange port.

4480
03:28:29,210 --> 03:28:31,090
They're not gonna lie.

4481
03:28:31,750 --> 03:28:32,690
They're strange.

4482
03:28:33,050 --> 03:28:35,690
That was so smart from their stream.

4483
03:28:35,990 --> 03:28:37,850
That's actually crazy.

4484
03:28:39,610 --> 03:28:40,330
Holy shit.

4485
03:28:41,110 --> 03:28:42,170
I got it, I got it.

4486
03:28:42,230 --> 03:28:42,510
Oh.

4487
03:28:42,810 --> 03:28:43,790
I got the ult though, I got the ult though.

4488
03:28:45,190 --> 03:28:46,510
I might be dead.

4489
03:28:46,670 --> 03:28:47,170
No, I'm okay.

4490
03:28:47,390 --> 03:28:49,250
Strange one, strange one, strange one, strange one.

4491
03:28:49,350 --> 03:28:51,110
Strange trap, strange trap, strange trap, strange trap.

4492
03:28:51,250 --> 03:28:51,710
I'm going in.

4493
03:28:51,950 --> 03:28:52,550
Oh, I'm stunned.

4494
03:28:53,350 --> 03:28:53,710
Oh.

4495
03:28:55,070 --> 03:28:56,590
There's a hulk behind us.

4496
03:29:01,700 --> 03:29:03,000
Oh my god!

4497
03:29:06,420 --> 03:29:07,360
Oh my god.

4498
03:29:07,360 --> 03:29:10,400
Ember Stranger already won the mental game.

4499
03:29:10,940 --> 03:29:12,760
Bro, that shit was crazy.

4500
03:29:13,660 --> 03:29:16,360
That was a fucking crazy...

4501
03:29:16,960 --> 03:29:18,340
Yeah, they still have their lowkey ult though.

4502
03:29:18,360 --> 03:29:18,900
They have their lowkey ult.

4503
03:29:19,060 --> 03:29:19,740
Yeah, they do, they do.

4504
03:29:22,860 --> 03:29:24,800
Oh, you just exploded.

4505
03:29:26,240 --> 03:29:27,620
Oh, we have hulk in the backline.

4506
03:29:27,720 --> 03:29:28,060
He's asleep.

4507
03:29:30,620 --> 03:29:33,060
Um, I'm with the hulk right now.

4508
03:29:34,220 --> 03:29:35,040
Hulk one, hulk one.

4509
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:38,580
I'm still being harassed by hulk.

4510
03:29:41,680 --> 03:29:42,860
Hulk is low, hulk is low.

4511
03:29:47,440 --> 03:29:49,400
They have no line of battle.

4512
03:29:50,960 --> 03:29:51,160
Yeah.

4513
03:29:56,740 --> 03:29:58,460
They're gonna have strange ult again soon.

4514
03:30:00,160 --> 03:30:01,080
Hulk is...

4515
03:30:01,080 --> 03:30:03,480
Oh, I couldn't do anything.

4516
03:30:05,140 --> 03:30:06,100
They're gonna have strange ult here.

4517
03:30:06,640 --> 03:30:07,460
And Wolverine ult.

4518
03:30:15,320 --> 03:30:15,620
Oh.

4519
03:30:15,740 --> 03:30:16,900
Oh, I don't have any heals left.

4520
03:30:22,080 --> 03:30:22,840
That's huge, that's huge.

4521
03:30:22,900 --> 03:30:23,620
Hulk, hulk, hulk, hulk's one.

4522
03:30:28,200 --> 03:30:29,120
I have all our hulks.

4523
03:30:30,940 --> 03:30:31,760
Strange one, strange one.

4524
03:30:34,060 --> 03:30:34,660
Come on, no more.

4525
03:30:35,180 --> 03:30:35,640
No more is low.

4526
03:30:35,920 --> 03:30:36,360
No more is one.

4527
03:30:38,220 --> 03:30:38,420
Nice.

4528
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:42,860
Oh my god.

4529
03:30:44,460 --> 03:30:46,320
That was... do they have portal?

4530
03:30:48,000 --> 03:30:49,120
Oh, they can't portal anymore.

4531
03:30:50,600 --> 03:30:51,080
Yeah.

4532
03:30:54,220 --> 03:30:55,140
Jesus Christ.

4533
03:30:56,560 --> 03:30:58,000
Wolverine at the top, top right.

4534
03:30:58,580 --> 03:30:59,200
Hulk is low.

4535
03:31:02,060 --> 03:31:02,920
Oh my god.

4536
03:31:04,260 --> 03:31:05,400
Oh, there he goes.

4537
03:31:05,800 --> 03:31:07,020
There he goes.

4538
03:31:08,940 --> 03:31:09,460
Nice.

4539
03:31:09,700 --> 03:31:10,280
That's a good trade.

4540
03:31:10,560 --> 03:31:11,620
We're even right now.

4541
03:31:14,960 --> 03:31:16,420
I'm on the walkie.

4542
03:31:17,840 --> 03:31:20,080
I can't save your ass!

4543
03:31:20,700 --> 03:31:21,960
Oh my god, no!

4544
03:31:24,060 --> 03:31:25,500
Hulk on backline, hulk on backline.

4545
03:31:26,920 --> 03:31:27,200
I got

4546
03:31:32,120 --> 03:31:32,440
it.

4547
03:31:33,020 --> 03:31:34,500
Wolverine top right, top right, top right.

4548
03:31:35,740 --> 03:31:37,020
Jesus Christ.

4549
03:31:38,880 --> 03:31:39,420
I got some.

4550
03:31:43,800 --> 03:31:44,140
Oh.

4551
03:31:51,080 --> 03:31:52,420
Yeah, no lamp, no lamp.

4552
03:31:53,460 --> 03:31:54,060
Hulk has ult too.

4553
03:31:54,940 --> 03:31:55,560
He's asleep.

4554
03:31:56,940 --> 03:31:58,300
I have hulk on me in the back.

4555
03:32:00,080 --> 03:32:01,820
I can't do anything, hulk is on me.

4556
03:32:08,560 --> 03:32:10,740
I should have walked to the chat.

4557
03:32:11,120 --> 03:32:12,580
I should have walked to the team.

4558
03:32:13,440 --> 03:32:14,320
Hulk ulted.

4559
03:32:16,500 --> 03:32:17,300
Yeah, that's my bad.

4560
03:32:17,340 --> 03:32:18,980
I should have walked to the team there.

4561
03:32:19,600 --> 03:32:21,660
So I wouldn't get separated.

4562
03:32:25,940 --> 03:32:27,100
That's my bad for...

4563
03:32:27,740 --> 03:32:29,060
They have strange ult here.

4564
03:32:32,020 --> 03:32:32,840
Hulk top right.

4565
03:32:33,940 --> 03:32:34,900
He's so low.

4566
03:32:36,740 --> 03:32:37,480
I'm gonna push.

4567
03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:38,580
Can you ult with me, Mantis?

4568
03:32:39,880 --> 03:32:40,960
I got my ult off.

4569
03:32:43,420 --> 03:32:44,740
Hulk, hulk, hulk, hulk!

4570
03:32:49,980 --> 03:32:50,580
That's insane.

4571
03:32:50,780 --> 03:32:52,380
They have no more ult here and low heal.

4572
03:32:54,480 --> 03:32:55,660
I'm damage boosting you guys.

4573
03:32:55,960 --> 03:32:56,400
In the front.

4574
03:33:07,490 --> 03:33:08,550
I'm on cart, I'm on cart.

4575
03:33:10,030 --> 03:33:10,730
Yeah, I'm on cart.

4576
03:33:10,990 --> 03:33:11,810
I'm gonna ult soon.

4577
03:33:15,550 --> 03:33:16,570
I'm damage boosting you.

4578
03:33:20,290 --> 03:33:21,450
Oh, I don't have leaves, sorry.

4579
03:33:22,450 --> 03:33:22,890
Got it.

4580
03:33:31,490 --> 03:33:32,310
Oh, shit!

4581
03:33:32,550 --> 03:33:33,350
I'm trying to keep you up.

4582
03:33:33,590 --> 03:33:33,990
I couldn't.

4583
03:33:34,250 --> 03:33:35,210
Wolverine's low, Wolverine's low.

4584
03:33:36,170 --> 03:33:37,130
Wolverine one, Wolverine one.

4585
03:33:38,490 --> 03:33:39,890
Only I'm healing, but...

4586
03:33:39,890 --> 03:33:40,650
Oh, there's a...

4587
03:33:41,330 --> 03:33:42,890
There's a Hulk behind me, there's a Hulk behind me.

4588
03:33:43,410 --> 03:33:44,070
Strange one.

4589
03:33:45,230 --> 03:33:46,790
Hulk, hulk, hulk, hulk one, hulk one.

4590
03:33:51,270 --> 03:33:52,710
I'm just standing away from cart.

4591
03:33:54,530 --> 03:33:56,470
I'm on cart now.

4592
03:33:57,270 --> 03:33:57,810
You're well off, Adolph.

4593
03:33:58,150 --> 03:33:59,510
Yeah, well off, we can't heal you guys.

4594
03:34:00,770 --> 03:34:01,770
Help is here.

4595
03:34:03,670 --> 03:34:04,850
I don't think they make it.

4596
03:34:05,610 --> 03:34:05,870
Nice.

4597
03:34:10,070 --> 03:34:11,090
Oh my god.

4598
03:34:11,430 --> 03:34:12,330
This is so...

4599
03:34:12,330 --> 03:34:13,310
Bro, I hate...

4600
03:34:13,310 --> 03:34:14,330
This is why I'm one of...

4601
03:34:14,330 --> 03:34:15,390
Oh, that's important though.

4602
03:34:15,630 --> 03:34:16,310
Oh, me, oh me, oh me.

4603
03:34:16,490 --> 03:34:16,950
Oh my god.

4604
03:34:17,510 --> 03:34:18,570
Oh, nice, nice pick.

4605
03:34:18,990 --> 03:34:19,830
Hulk, hulk half, hulk half.

4606
03:34:21,030 --> 03:34:21,730
Hulk one.

4607
03:34:23,010 --> 03:34:24,210
I think he's getting healed though, yeah.

4608
03:34:24,970 --> 03:34:25,570
He is getting healed.

4609
03:34:32,120 --> 03:34:32,840
Jesus Christ.

4610
03:34:33,400 --> 03:34:35,640
Only 16 seconds left.

4611
03:34:35,700 --> 03:34:36,600
Hulk, hulk, hulk, hulk, hulk.

4612
03:34:36,760 --> 03:34:37,400
I'm ulting this.

4613
03:34:38,460 --> 03:34:39,000
Hulk asleep.

4614
03:34:39,940 --> 03:34:40,880
Yeah, we got shrooms, we got shrooms.

4615
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:41,560
Get hulk, get hulk.

4616
03:34:41,780 --> 03:34:42,500
Hulk, hulk, hulk, hulk, hulk.

4617
03:34:42,960 --> 03:34:43,680
Half, half, half, half.

4618
03:34:43,740 --> 03:34:43,920
One.

4619
03:34:48,180 --> 03:34:48,880
Oh, we don't...

4620
03:34:48,880 --> 03:34:50,660
I don't know if we can get support all in time.

4621
03:34:52,460 --> 03:34:53,240
Neymar, Neymar, Neymar, Neymar.

4622
03:34:53,540 --> 03:34:54,440
I'm on cart, I'm on cart.

4623
03:34:56,660 --> 03:34:58,580
I am ready to put on a show.

4624
03:34:58,860 --> 03:34:59,900
No lamp, no lamp.

4625
03:34:59,900 --> 03:35:02,020
I'm trying to ult.

4626
03:35:04,640 --> 03:35:05,580
I'm backing up a little bit.

4627
03:35:05,840 --> 03:35:06,540
Can I get focus you?

4628
03:35:06,800 --> 03:35:07,520
Can I get focus you?

4629
03:35:07,540 --> 03:35:08,000
I'm going to ult him.

4630
03:35:08,180 --> 03:35:09,020
I got Neymar'd.

4631
03:35:09,580 --> 03:35:11,580
Oh my god.

4632
03:35:13,720 --> 03:35:15,160
I'm about to have ult, I'm about to have ult.

4633
03:35:16,720 --> 03:35:17,320
We have TP.

4634
03:35:19,120 --> 03:35:20,600
Wow, what a quad.

4635
03:35:21,160 --> 03:35:22,040
I'm going to ult to the TP.

4636
03:35:22,260 --> 03:35:23,180
Can you make like an angle?

4637
03:35:25,380 --> 03:35:26,100
10 seconds.

4638
03:35:29,470 --> 03:35:31,210
Yeah, 5 seconds, 4 seconds.

4639
03:35:32,010 --> 03:35:33,290
2, 1.

4640
03:35:38,430 --> 03:35:40,830
That was a crazy will.

4641
03:35:43,630 --> 03:35:44,150
Damn.

4642
03:35:47,890 --> 03:35:49,850
Yeah, portal was way too far away.

4643
03:35:52,810 --> 03:35:54,390
That's why I was like...

4644
03:35:54,390 --> 03:35:55,770
When he was like, I'm going to portal.

4645
03:35:56,050 --> 03:35:56,610
I'm like...

4646
03:35:58,910 --> 03:36:01,410
I don't know if we're going to make it.

4647
03:36:04,010 --> 03:36:05,550
You should have just put the portal.

4648
03:36:05,850 --> 03:36:06,610
You shouldn't have like...

4649
03:36:09,650 --> 03:36:12,030
You shouldn't have like thought about it.

4650
03:36:12,190 --> 03:36:13,650
You should have just made it instantly.

4651
03:36:15,410 --> 03:36:17,430
He was thinking about angles and stuff.

4652
03:36:17,890 --> 03:36:19,150
You shouldn't have tried to position.

4653
03:36:22,130 --> 03:36:23,150
You know what's crazy?

4654
03:36:23,690 --> 03:36:25,350
I've been bumped into another streamer.

4655
03:36:26,030 --> 03:36:27,970
That's what I'm saying.

4656
03:36:28,110 --> 03:36:32,350
Every time I do these grinds, I'm bumped into nobody.

4657
03:36:37,070 --> 03:36:38,650
Like, I don't...

4658
03:36:38,650 --> 03:36:41,370
Everybody and their mom is fucking queuing.

4659
03:36:41,550 --> 03:36:42,350
Why am I...

4660
03:36:46,410 --> 03:36:47,730
Don't understand.

4661
03:36:51,690 --> 03:36:54,130
Never get to interact with people.

4662
03:36:56,590 --> 03:36:57,510
Look at that.

4663
03:37:00,530 --> 03:37:02,350
4k guy was a streamer.

4664
03:37:02,410 --> 03:37:04,390
He wasn't even fucking live and you know it.

4665
03:37:07,070 --> 03:37:09,230
You're not queue sniping.

4666
03:37:10,710 --> 03:37:14,190
I want to just naturally bump into them.

4667
03:37:14,650 --> 03:37:16,560
Is that too much to ask for?

4668
03:37:17,470 --> 03:37:18,110
Behind us.

4669
03:37:18,190 --> 03:37:19,030
Oh my god.

4670
03:37:19,270 --> 03:37:20,370
I'm backing him, I'm backing him, I'm backing him.

4671
03:37:20,870 --> 03:37:23,430
Oh my god, that was scary.

4672
03:37:23,630 --> 03:37:24,530
Wait, there's a Warwick behind us.

4673
03:37:24,530 --> 03:37:25,270
He's asleep, he's asleep.

4674
03:37:27,450 --> 03:37:27,810
1v1.

4675
03:37:31,650 --> 03:37:32,370
Got you.

4676
03:37:32,930 --> 03:37:34,390
Oh my god, there's a Hulk behind us.

4677
03:37:34,470 --> 03:37:35,170
There's a Hulk on us.

4678
03:37:36,250 --> 03:37:37,290
I'm trying to help you, Luna.

4679
03:37:42,490 --> 03:37:46,610
I need help here.

4680
03:37:48,250 --> 03:37:48,750
Thank you.

4681
03:37:50,010 --> 03:37:50,670
I don't have leaves.

4682
03:37:50,830 --> 03:37:51,150
Sorry.

4683
03:37:54,670 --> 03:37:56,190
Farming leaves off of him.

4684
03:37:57,910 --> 03:38:00,370
I was trying to say surefour.

4685
03:38:00,670 --> 03:38:01,670
Strange is low.

4686
03:38:03,350 --> 03:38:04,330
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

4687
03:38:10,970 --> 03:38:13,030
I can't see you, Punisher.

4688
03:38:13,650 --> 03:38:14,610
They're so low.

4689
03:38:14,930 --> 03:38:15,630
They're all so low.

4690
03:38:16,650 --> 03:38:17,870
Surefour is low.

4691
03:38:19,090 --> 03:38:21,450
I was going to say strange and then I went...

4692
03:38:22,650 --> 03:38:25,610
I just called him surefour and I was trying to say strange.

4693
03:38:27,910 --> 03:38:29,010
Oh my god.

4694
03:38:30,390 --> 03:38:31,190
Rent-free.

4695
03:38:34,330 --> 03:38:35,810
Standard buff starts with S.

4696
03:38:36,010 --> 03:38:37,170
Do you really blame me?

4697
03:38:37,430 --> 03:38:38,850
I can't even break this fucking wall.

4698
03:38:39,330 --> 03:38:40,670
I'm not strong enough.

4699
03:38:40,790 --> 03:38:42,390
I'm just a weak little girl.

4700
03:38:42,930 --> 03:38:45,430
I can't even break this fucking wall.

4701
03:38:51,530 --> 03:38:52,110
I'm melting.

4702
03:38:53,070 --> 03:38:53,930
It's fine, it's fine, you're fine, you're fine.

4703
03:38:54,090 --> 03:38:54,830
I'm damage boosting you.

4704
03:39:00,770 --> 03:39:01,270
Oh.

4705
03:39:03,010 --> 03:39:04,650
There's a Wolverine behind us.

4706
03:39:05,330 --> 03:39:06,010
And a Hulk too.

4707
03:39:06,410 --> 03:39:07,430
One back, one back, one back.

4708
03:39:08,790 --> 03:39:09,290
I stunned him.

4709
03:39:11,550 --> 03:39:12,810
There's a Hulk behind again.

4710
03:39:16,900 --> 03:39:19,020
We have two tanks on us.

4711
03:39:21,280 --> 03:39:22,580
Oh my god.

4712
03:39:23,440 --> 03:39:24,520
We couldn't do anything.

4713
03:39:27,480 --> 03:39:29,220
They used both tank ults.

4714
03:39:30,020 --> 03:39:31,520
They used every ult, actually.

4715
03:39:31,640 --> 03:39:32,320
They used everything.

4716
03:39:32,520 --> 03:39:32,860
Yeah, they did.

4717
03:39:34,700 --> 03:39:36,180
And Hulk ult soon.

4718
03:39:38,340 --> 03:39:39,640
Oh my god.

4719
03:39:39,980 --> 03:39:42,100
I wish I was strong enough for this.

4720
03:39:50,080 --> 03:39:53,600
I'm just gonna damage boost everything and hope something happens.

4721
03:39:53,860 --> 03:39:54,340
Hulk half.

4722
03:39:54,340 --> 03:39:54,880
Oh.

4723
03:39:57,660 --> 03:39:58,960
Oh, actually I dropped off.

4724
03:39:59,200 --> 03:40:00,640
Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna.

4725
03:40:02,720 --> 03:40:04,840
Oh, the Hulk was so low.

4726
03:40:05,140 --> 03:40:05,780
Monkey one, monkey one.

4727
03:40:07,100 --> 03:40:07,580
Monkey dead.

4728
03:40:09,480 --> 03:40:10,260
Strange one, strange one.

4729
03:40:10,280 --> 03:40:11,060
Strange one, strange one.

4730
03:40:11,720 --> 03:40:13,260
You have no supports, you have no supports.

4731
03:40:17,480 --> 03:40:18,740
We're coming back now.

4732
03:40:19,320 --> 03:40:21,500
We're up a lot if we can make it back in time.

4733
03:40:24,700 --> 03:40:25,260
Um...

4734
03:40:25,260 --> 03:40:26,440
I can't damage.

4735
03:40:26,580 --> 03:40:27,960
Oh, oh my god.

4736
03:40:29,400 --> 03:40:30,260
Crazy, Luna.

4737
03:40:38,300 --> 03:40:39,300
Number one again.

4738
03:40:40,940 --> 03:40:42,180
Live, live, live, live, live.

4739
03:40:43,820 --> 03:40:44,960
They should have strange ult soon.

4740
03:40:46,160 --> 03:40:51,020
Oh my god, I'm lagging.

4741
03:40:57,950 --> 03:40:59,070
Hulk is sleeping.

4742
03:41:00,750 --> 03:41:01,230
Woo!

4743
03:41:01,950 --> 03:41:02,690
I'm ulting this.

4744
03:41:03,210 --> 03:41:04,350
They're gonna have strange ult though.

4745
03:41:05,250 --> 03:41:06,210
Please strange ult it.

4746
03:41:07,250 --> 03:41:08,190
Strange one, strange one.

4747
03:41:11,370 --> 03:41:16,370
I have Hulk on us.

4748
03:41:16,430 --> 03:41:17,630
Hulk is asleep, Hulk is asleep.

4749
03:41:18,910 --> 03:41:20,110
I'm frozen too.

4750
03:41:21,350 --> 03:41:22,130
I need help.

4751
03:41:26,890 --> 03:41:27,850
Jesus Christ.

4752
03:41:29,450 --> 03:41:31,070
I think they're just better.

4753
03:41:31,570 --> 03:41:33,950
I think it's just the team though.

4754
03:41:37,550 --> 03:41:41,570
I think their tank line is just really good.

4755
03:41:43,330 --> 03:41:43,610
I think.

4756
03:41:44,950 --> 03:41:47,830
Like, both their tanks are working together really well.

4757
03:41:51,210 --> 03:41:51,950
Oh my god.

4758
03:41:52,670 --> 03:41:53,570
Strange no shield.

4759
03:41:56,990 --> 03:41:59,510
I'm trying my best to damage boost everybody.

4760
03:42:01,170 --> 03:42:01,950
Hulk asleep, Hulk asleep.

4761
03:42:02,690 --> 03:42:03,170
Hulk one.

4762
03:42:08,210 --> 03:42:10,350
Oh, I'm sorry Punisher.

4763
03:42:13,990 --> 03:42:14,390
Nope.

4764
03:42:15,090 --> 03:42:16,650
I have Hulk like on my spawn.

4765
03:42:21,660 --> 03:42:22,260
Wolverine?

4766
03:42:22,380 --> 03:42:23,000
Wolverine half?

4767
03:42:31,430 --> 03:42:32,150
Oh my god.

4768
03:42:34,490 --> 03:42:35,130
Neymar half?

4769
03:42:38,640 --> 03:42:39,660
Oh, I don't have leaves, sorry.

4770
03:42:44,430 --> 03:42:45,130
I'm ulting this.

4771
03:42:45,210 --> 03:42:45,770
We lost their Luna.

4772
03:42:47,710 --> 03:42:48,210
Got their heals.

4773
03:42:50,710 --> 03:42:51,770
I don't think...

4774
03:42:51,770 --> 03:42:52,310
Oh my god.

4775
03:42:52,370 --> 03:42:52,990
Wolverine, Wolverine one.

4776
03:42:53,090 --> 03:42:53,910
No more, no more.

4777
03:42:55,010 --> 03:42:55,990
Yeah, they're on me, they're on me.

4778
03:42:57,470 --> 03:42:59,330
We're even though right now, so we gotta be careful.

4779
03:43:01,390 --> 03:43:02,390
Change, change, change, change, change.

4780
03:43:03,070 --> 03:43:04,270
Change his ult, change his one.

4781
03:43:07,650 --> 03:43:09,370
They have, they have their Strange ult.

4782
03:43:12,050 --> 03:43:12,470
3,

4783
03:43:15,590 --> 03:43:16,150
2, 1.

4784
03:43:17,490 --> 03:43:17,910
Nice.

4785
03:43:18,330 --> 03:43:18,850
Bliss, bliss.

4786
03:43:20,310 --> 03:43:21,310
Oh my god.

4787
03:43:21,630 --> 03:43:22,750
We have to do three fights.

4788
03:43:26,210 --> 03:43:29,890
Oh my god, our fucking Luna went in front of me, so I couldn't...

4789
03:43:29,890 --> 03:43:32,290
I need to like, make sure I don't waste my leaves.

4790
03:43:32,390 --> 03:43:33,470
Am I ulting early?

4791
03:43:33,810 --> 03:43:34,670
Yeah, I think I'm gonna ult early.

4792
03:43:35,950 --> 03:43:37,110
Oh wait, that's my turn.

4793
03:43:39,190 --> 03:43:41,110
Yes, he's looking for Strange ult, he's looking for it.

4794
03:43:41,350 --> 03:43:42,810
I grabbed him, I grabbed him, I grabbed him, I grabbed him.

4795
03:43:43,850 --> 03:43:45,510
He's still looking for it though.

4796
03:43:52,190 --> 03:43:53,050
Wolverine has ult too.

4797
03:43:54,810 --> 03:43:55,770
Luna, Luna, Luna on the left.

4798
03:44:01,110 --> 03:44:02,530
I'm trying to keep you guys up.

4799
03:44:03,210 --> 03:44:03,710
I got you.

4800
03:44:06,370 --> 03:44:07,290
Hog is sleeping, hog is sleeping.

4801
03:44:07,330 --> 03:44:07,870
Luna on the back, we need to get the Luna.

4802
03:44:11,010 --> 03:44:13,050
I got, I got Wolverine.

4803
03:44:15,930 --> 03:44:18,210
Oh my god, I got Wolverine.

4804
03:44:19,670 --> 03:44:20,730
This is bad.

4805
03:44:21,030 --> 03:44:22,470
Oh, it's over.

4806
03:44:23,630 --> 03:44:24,510
It's over.

4807
03:44:25,110 --> 03:44:25,590
No!

4808
03:44:26,990 --> 03:44:29,350
I got Wolverine!

4809
03:44:29,350 --> 03:44:31,610
I got him.

4810
03:44:40,980 --> 03:44:44,220
Their tank line was, their tanks really good.

4811
03:44:45,120 --> 03:44:50,700
I mean, their tanks played really well together.

4812
03:44:52,900 --> 03:44:54,260
That was a Wolverine.

4813
03:44:54,380 --> 03:44:58,780
Yeah, because our tanks kept getting, our tanks had to fight against the Wolverine.

4814
03:44:59,320 --> 03:45:02,500
So like, so like, we were always missing one.

4815
03:45:02,700 --> 03:45:05,240
Yeah, and then our Luna was not having a good time.

4816
03:45:06,480 --> 03:45:12,240
Our Luna was not having a good fucking time there.

4817
03:45:12,960 --> 03:45:16,200
She was, she was getting fucked up.

4818
03:45:21,700 --> 03:45:22,340
Yeah.

4819
03:45:23,720 --> 03:45:25,440
She got, she got fucked up there.

4820
03:45:25,600 --> 03:45:26,640
Wait, what the fuck?

4821
03:45:26,660 --> 03:45:28,320
How did the GMs get into our lobby?

4822
03:45:29,380 --> 03:45:30,540
Holy shit.

4823
03:45:37,380 --> 03:45:38,600
Oh, that's cool.

4824
03:45:38,860 --> 03:45:39,780
Rest in peace.

4825
03:45:40,160 --> 03:45:42,060
Rest in peace to our Luna.

4826
03:45:42,200 --> 03:45:43,480
Our Luna was not having it.

4827
03:45:43,900 --> 03:45:46,340
She kept getting harassed and I tried my best to keep her up.

4828
03:45:49,120 --> 03:45:50,020
Yeah, they can.

4829
03:45:50,240 --> 03:45:50,720
They can.

4830
03:45:50,780 --> 03:45:52,520
They can also play with uh...

4831
03:45:52,520 --> 03:45:58,120
I know a lot of like Eternity players play with GM players to get easier games to climb.

4832
03:46:02,880 --> 03:46:04,740
And that's like something people frown upon.

4833
03:46:09,320 --> 03:46:09,960
Yeah.

4834
03:46:10,660 --> 03:46:12,580
Yeah, they exploit to get lower rank queues.

4835
03:46:13,020 --> 03:46:15,380
Apparently that's like a really uh...

4836
03:46:15,380 --> 03:46:17,740
That's like a really uh...

4837
03:46:19,380 --> 03:46:20,840
Uh... taboo thing.

4838
03:46:24,110 --> 03:46:26,350
Oh yeah, fuck Hawkeye in general.

4839
03:46:27,850 --> 03:46:28,170
Yeah.

4840
03:46:29,010 --> 03:46:30,350
I'll listen to my duo.

4841
03:46:30,590 --> 03:46:31,610
Sounds kind of lame.

4842
03:46:32,690 --> 03:46:33,710
I mean...

4843
03:46:33,710 --> 03:46:35,530
People would do anything for rank points.

4844
03:46:38,470 --> 03:46:39,670
I almost...

4845
03:46:39,670 --> 03:46:41,290
I almost poached somebody.

4846
03:46:43,790 --> 03:46:46,410
The only thing stopping me was Boger.

4847
03:46:50,750 --> 03:46:55,250
If Boger wasn't there to be the angel on my shoulder, I would have done it.

4848
03:46:55,710 --> 03:46:58,330
I would have done it.

4849
03:47:02,990 --> 03:47:03,810
See, look.

4850
03:47:04,150 --> 03:47:05,370
I'm not a bad person.

4851
03:47:10,010 --> 03:47:10,330
Alright.

4852
03:47:21,650 --> 03:47:22,190
Let's go.

4853
03:47:22,290 --> 03:47:23,290
Can you go Mantis though, Kayn?

4854
03:47:23,810 --> 03:47:24,730
Oh, yeah, yeah, I can.

4855
03:47:24,790 --> 03:47:25,150
Yeah, I can.

4856
03:47:25,450 --> 03:47:26,210
I mean, yeah, I think so.

4857
03:47:26,210 --> 03:47:26,830
I think so.

4858
03:47:26,870 --> 03:47:27,390
I think, yeah.

4859
03:47:29,110 --> 03:47:30,850
It's a little bit rough without Nadal.

4860
03:47:31,130 --> 03:47:32,150
We just gotta play safe.

4861
03:47:40,800 --> 03:47:42,180
I only said he was...

4862
03:47:42,180 --> 03:47:43,280
I didn't say he was legit.

4863
03:47:43,540 --> 03:47:51,480
I said it's really weird that Dune would risk her reputation playing with a hacker.

4864
03:47:52,040 --> 03:47:53,060
That's why I was like...

4865
03:47:53,060 --> 03:47:56,300
I didn't think he was hacking because of it.

4866
03:48:00,760 --> 03:48:02,020
That's why I was like...

4867
03:48:02,020 --> 03:48:06,840
I think it's weird because I see her play with other pro players before, so I thought it'd be really weird.

4868
03:48:08,880 --> 03:48:11,260
I also sense great sarcasm.

4869
03:48:11,780 --> 03:48:15,780
I didn't watch the replay just because of that.

4870
03:48:18,700 --> 03:48:22,120
Wait, what is the passive?

4871
03:48:22,380 --> 03:48:22,820
I'm so confused.

4872
03:48:22,820 --> 03:48:23,620
Oh, the rez?

4873
03:48:23,920 --> 03:48:25,920
The rez would not be so working.

4874
03:48:26,700 --> 03:48:27,300
Alright.

4875
03:48:27,640 --> 03:48:29,000
There's a match behind us.

4876
03:48:29,860 --> 03:48:30,740
Lunar or not, man.

4877
03:48:31,140 --> 03:48:31,480
I'll eat.

4878
03:48:36,280 --> 03:48:36,720
Oh!

4879
03:48:38,580 --> 03:48:39,760
Bro, what the fuck?

4880
03:48:39,900 --> 03:48:41,360
I missed my wave while playing this.

4881
03:48:43,460 --> 03:48:44,120
Oh, nice.

4882
03:48:48,340 --> 03:48:49,200
I slept somebody?

4883
03:48:54,770 --> 03:48:59,230
Babe, I knew we were gonna...

4884
03:48:59,850 --> 03:49:00,570
Might just have to.

4885
03:49:01,430 --> 03:49:02,290
Shouldn't just have to.

4886
03:49:06,160 --> 03:49:06,840
Woah!

4887
03:49:08,340 --> 03:49:10,380
I'm gonna grab this.

4888
03:49:11,400 --> 03:49:12,880
Oh my god, I'm really low.

4889
03:49:19,060 --> 03:49:21,920
Jesus Christ, I'm taking so much damage.

4890
03:49:24,140 --> 03:49:25,160
I really need heals.

4891
03:49:30,850 --> 03:49:31,170
Magic.

4892
03:49:34,630 --> 03:49:36,070
Magic no half?

4893
03:49:36,210 --> 03:49:36,990
Magic no sleep.

4894
03:49:37,430 --> 03:49:38,010
Magic one.

4895
03:49:46,510 --> 03:49:46,870
Magic one.

4896
03:49:50,510 --> 03:49:51,590
I'm gonna ult this.

4897
03:49:53,010 --> 03:49:54,510
Go, go, go, go, go.

4898
03:49:54,570 --> 03:49:55,310
Luna, Luna, Luna.

4899
03:49:55,510 --> 03:49:55,890
Superpush up.

4900
03:49:55,950 --> 03:49:57,230
Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna.

4901
03:49:57,270 --> 03:49:58,590
Magno one, Magno one, Magno one!

4902
03:49:58,730 --> 03:49:59,530
Mag, Mag, Mag.

4903
03:49:59,710 --> 03:50:00,530
Behind us, somebody.

4904
03:50:00,650 --> 03:50:00,850
Magic.

4905
03:50:01,450 --> 03:50:02,290
Magic, Magic, Magic.

4906
03:50:02,430 --> 03:50:03,070
Where was she?

4907
03:50:03,890 --> 03:50:04,710
I'm gonna hit that turret.

4908
03:50:05,850 --> 03:50:07,250
There's an Amour in the hallway.

4909
03:50:09,570 --> 03:50:10,290
She's one, she's one.

4910
03:50:11,450 --> 03:50:12,410
I'm getting three on cart.

4911
03:50:12,570 --> 03:50:13,090
I'm getting three on cart.

4912
03:50:13,430 --> 03:50:15,270
Uh, an Amour and Mantis are in push, yeah.

4913
03:50:15,410 --> 03:50:16,550
I'm backing out, I'm backing out a little bit.

4914
03:50:17,270 --> 03:50:18,130
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

4915
03:50:18,170 --> 03:50:18,610
Magic, Magic.

4916
03:50:19,750 --> 03:50:21,330
They have strange ult after this though.

4917
03:50:22,250 --> 03:50:23,030
And Mantis ult.

4918
03:50:23,150 --> 03:50:24,290
Not Mantis, uh, Magic.

4919
03:50:26,390 --> 03:50:26,970
We got hit.

4920
03:50:28,770 --> 03:50:29,710
I see, oh, I see Strange.

4921
03:50:30,130 --> 03:50:31,150
I can't see you, Starlord.

4922
03:50:31,230 --> 03:50:32,630
I can damage boost you if you want to ult.

4923
03:50:33,110 --> 03:50:33,870
Oh, you're already ulted.

4924
03:50:36,930 --> 03:50:38,130
He's looking for ult, Strange.

4925
03:50:38,590 --> 03:50:39,390
He's still asleep.

4926
03:50:40,990 --> 03:50:41,790
Strange is looking for ult.

4927
03:50:42,890 --> 03:50:43,370
I can't see you.

4928
03:50:43,410 --> 03:50:44,890
Magic on me in the back, Magic on me in the back.

4929
03:50:44,910 --> 03:50:46,130
I got damage boosted, you take an Amour.

4930
03:50:51,730 --> 03:50:52,330
Magic, go on Magic.

4931
03:50:52,430 --> 03:50:53,110
Actually, pick someone here.

4932
03:50:53,690 --> 03:50:54,790
I can't keep you up.

4933
03:50:55,790 --> 03:50:56,430
Oh, fuck.

4934
03:50:57,150 --> 03:50:57,730
My bad, my bad.

4935
03:51:00,710 --> 03:51:01,690
Oh my god.

4936
03:51:07,080 --> 03:51:07,400
Please.

4937
03:51:09,420 --> 03:51:10,860
Please do something, DPS.

4938
03:51:15,260 --> 03:51:15,660
Please.

4939
03:51:19,040 --> 03:51:19,800
Magneto half.

4940
03:51:19,980 --> 03:51:20,640
Magneto half.

4941
03:51:20,680 --> 03:51:21,460
My half, my half.

4942
03:51:26,100 --> 03:51:27,580
He's still having Strange ulted.

4943
03:51:29,080 --> 03:51:29,840
He has Strange ult.

4944
03:51:32,160 --> 03:51:33,100
Damage boosting you, Starlord?

4945
03:51:33,380 --> 03:51:33,560
Oh.

4946
03:51:42,170 --> 03:51:43,170
More right side, one.

4947
03:51:43,770 --> 03:51:44,850
I can ult this in.

4948
03:51:45,710 --> 03:51:46,510
I'm ulting this in.

4949
03:51:46,650 --> 03:51:46,910
I'm going.

4950
03:51:50,530 --> 03:51:52,250
They triggered Luna ult.

4951
03:51:53,630 --> 03:51:54,870
They have Luna ult too.

4952
03:51:55,530 --> 03:51:56,610
No, they just Luna ulted you again.

4953
03:51:58,170 --> 03:51:58,810
Oh my god.

4954
03:52:00,590 --> 03:52:02,130
There's a Magic behind us.

4955
03:52:05,600 --> 03:52:06,740
Oh my god, please.

4956
03:52:07,880 --> 03:52:08,160
Dude.

4957
03:52:10,660 --> 03:52:11,700
Do something.

4958
03:52:12,720 --> 03:52:13,600
This is last place.

4959
03:52:17,500 --> 03:52:18,920
Oh my god.

4960
03:52:18,920 --> 03:52:23,460
That's just what's up.

4961
03:52:27,940 --> 03:52:29,180
Do something.

4962
03:52:36,390 --> 03:52:38,450
Oh my god, I don't know.

4963
03:52:44,110 --> 03:52:45,660
That was just...

4964
03:52:46,410 --> 03:52:47,190
I don't know.

4965
03:52:47,590 --> 03:52:49,150
I feel like we got nothing out of it.

4966
03:52:49,410 --> 03:52:50,600
I damage boosted...

4967
03:52:51,520 --> 03:52:53,920
I damage boosted everybody.

4968
03:52:54,240 --> 03:52:58,200
And I got zero kills out of it.

4969
03:52:58,920 --> 03:53:03,880
That was like...

4970
03:53:03,880 --> 03:53:05,820
Yeah, I was just like...

4971
03:53:05,820 --> 03:53:09,560
Nobody got anything out of my damage boost.

4972
03:53:09,640 --> 03:53:11,680
I was like, you're all damage boosted.

4973
03:53:11,860 --> 03:53:12,840
Kill something.

4974
03:53:12,840 --> 03:53:13,140
Do something.

4975
03:53:24,650 --> 03:53:27,890
When we're using ults, it's not as defensive.

4976
03:53:28,930 --> 03:53:30,110
Like the Luna ult.

4977
03:53:30,490 --> 03:53:32,210
Usually the Mantis is the aggressor.

4978
03:53:36,730 --> 03:53:38,570
I was like, here's my Mantis ult.

4979
03:53:38,650 --> 03:53:39,510
Do something.

4980
03:53:40,190 --> 03:53:42,690
And then I triggered Luna ult though, so that's fine.

4981
03:53:45,570 --> 03:53:48,390
They also went double tank, so it's like...

4982
03:53:49,970 --> 03:53:52,210
It just is what it is.

4983
03:53:58,470 --> 03:53:58,990
Alright,

4984
03:54:04,650 --> 03:54:05,490
I have no idea.

4985
03:54:05,530 --> 03:54:06,450
I don't know.

4986
03:54:06,690 --> 03:54:07,510
I don't know.

4987
03:54:08,070 --> 03:54:09,530
This game seems a little rough.

4988
03:54:10,670 --> 03:54:11,490
This one.

4989
03:54:12,090 --> 03:54:14,070
This one seems just a little rough.

4990
03:54:14,410 --> 03:54:15,870
I think we also have like...

4991
03:54:16,550 --> 03:54:18,110
We have like Adam player.

4992
03:54:21,510 --> 03:54:23,710
We don't have Mantis, Luna.

4993
03:54:25,450 --> 03:54:26,510
And it's like...

4994
03:54:26,510 --> 03:54:27,370
We're gonna have a...

4995
03:54:27,370 --> 03:54:28,750
If Mantis isn't...

4996
03:54:28,750 --> 03:54:29,450
Magic's 2, right?

4997
03:54:30,930 --> 03:54:31,490
He's coming over.

4998
03:54:36,240 --> 03:54:36,840
I can help.

4999
03:54:37,060 --> 03:54:37,520
I can help.

5000
03:54:37,620 --> 03:54:37,840
I can help.

5001
03:54:38,300 --> 03:54:40,400
I healed you too.

5002
03:54:41,720 --> 03:54:42,120
Alright, it's fine.

5003
03:54:46,940 --> 03:54:47,820
Oh my god.

5004
03:54:47,820 --> 03:54:50,160
Everybody's taking so much damage.

5005
03:54:57,580 --> 03:54:58,380
What?!

5006
03:54:58,380 --> 03:54:59,820
What is our DPS?!

5007
03:55:04,360 --> 03:55:07,640
What is our DPS doing?!

5008
03:55:07,640 --> 03:55:09,080
Oh my god!

5009
03:55:09,480 --> 03:55:11,780
No, this is 100% a DPS diff.

5010
03:55:11,880 --> 03:55:14,420
I refuse to think of anything else.

5011
03:55:15,800 --> 03:55:19,100
No, this is definitely a DPS diff.

5012
03:55:19,180 --> 03:55:19,520
Oh my god!

5013
03:55:21,020 --> 03:55:21,540
Whatever.

5014
03:55:21,580 --> 03:55:22,140
Magic behind.

5015
03:55:23,400 --> 03:55:25,340
What a shit show.

5016
03:55:30,780 --> 03:55:32,260
There's a Magic behind us?

5017
03:55:32,920 --> 03:55:33,620
On our Adam?

5018
03:55:34,120 --> 03:55:35,160
A stranger, maybe?

5019
03:55:39,340 --> 03:55:40,640
I need heals here.

5020
03:55:40,820 --> 03:55:42,180
We have...

5021
03:55:43,260 --> 03:55:44,440
A reload.

5022
03:55:44,440 --> 03:55:44,740
Reload.

5023
03:55:53,920 --> 03:55:54,320
Okay,

5024
03:55:58,860 --> 03:55:59,940
I might die to this.

5025
03:56:00,140 --> 03:56:00,540
But I'm okay.

5026
03:56:05,500 --> 03:56:06,860
I should've been on Luna.

5027
03:56:07,020 --> 03:56:07,940
I should've been on Luna.

5028
03:56:08,060 --> 03:56:10,020
I don't think our Luna knew how to play Luna.

5029
03:56:10,820 --> 03:56:12,120
We have no support ults too.

5030
03:56:14,440 --> 03:56:14,980
I don't hear the Luna.

5031
03:56:17,200 --> 03:56:18,300
I'm fucking blind.

5032
03:56:21,380 --> 03:56:22,400
Did they Mantis ult?

5033
03:56:22,800 --> 03:56:23,640
I know they have Magical.

5034
03:56:23,820 --> 03:56:25,000
No, a long time ago.

5035
03:56:25,100 --> 03:56:25,680
A long time ago.

5036
03:56:25,800 --> 03:56:26,540
So they might have it again.

5037
03:56:26,680 --> 03:56:28,180
Yeah, they definitely have Magical here.

5038
03:56:35,230 --> 03:56:36,290
He's behind us, I think.

5039
03:56:39,810 --> 03:56:40,530
That's really good.

5040
03:56:40,750 --> 03:56:40,930
Nice.

5041
03:56:41,090 --> 03:56:42,250
I wonder if...

5042
03:56:42,970 --> 03:56:43,730
They won't hide?

5043
03:56:43,830 --> 03:56:44,250
I wonder why not.

5044
03:56:44,510 --> 03:56:45,270
Stranger than man, yeah.

5045
03:56:48,530 --> 03:56:48,990
I'm coming.

5046
03:56:51,370 --> 03:56:53,030
Oh my god, I need to focus on heals.

5047
03:56:53,790 --> 03:56:55,650
I'm focusing so hard right now.

5048
03:56:56,670 --> 03:56:57,630
The Stranger is out of position.

5049
03:56:58,210 --> 03:56:58,950
Stranger one, Stranger one.

5050
03:56:59,030 --> 03:57:00,290
Stranger, Stranger one, Stranger one, Stranger one.

5051
03:57:01,270 --> 03:57:04,770
I think I can kill them both here.

5052
03:57:05,110 --> 03:57:05,810
One more minute, guys.

5053
03:57:05,850 --> 03:57:06,230
One more minute.

5054
03:57:06,510 --> 03:57:07,870
I'm going in the backline, I'm going in the backline.

5055
03:57:09,090 --> 03:57:10,190
We gotta push up that...

5056
03:57:10,190 --> 03:57:11,190
Oh, we don't have Luna left.

5057
03:57:13,370 --> 03:57:14,010
Push him, push him.

5058
03:57:14,350 --> 03:57:14,650
We get the kill.

5059
03:57:14,650 --> 03:57:15,450
Back, back, back, back, back.

5060
03:57:16,630 --> 03:57:17,710
I have the name of the blue.

5061
03:57:19,390 --> 03:57:20,230
I have ult soon.

5062
03:57:20,330 --> 03:57:21,110
I have ult in five.

5063
03:57:21,230 --> 03:57:21,950
Can we get the magic?

5064
03:57:22,090 --> 03:57:22,410
Where is she?

5065
03:57:22,590 --> 03:57:22,970
She has ult.

5066
03:57:22,970 --> 03:57:23,230
I don't know.

5067
03:57:23,290 --> 03:57:24,130
She's behind us somewhere.

5068
03:57:24,210 --> 03:57:24,670
She's gonna wait.

5069
03:57:25,930 --> 03:57:28,410
Yeah, I might be able to grab ult before she ults.

5070
03:57:28,430 --> 03:57:30,150
I have four percent.

5071
03:57:30,350 --> 03:57:31,210
You will have your ult.

5072
03:57:31,410 --> 03:57:32,030
You will have it.

5073
03:57:35,110 --> 03:57:36,410
They might be keeping eyeshield on soon.

5074
03:57:36,530 --> 03:57:37,150
And they won't hide?

5075
03:57:37,190 --> 03:57:38,170
No, they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't.

5076
03:57:38,290 --> 03:57:38,630
I have it.

5077
03:57:38,650 --> 03:57:39,050
I have my ult.

5078
03:57:43,660 --> 03:57:44,360
They have magic on me.

5079
03:57:44,440 --> 03:57:44,740
They have magic on me.

5080
03:57:45,800 --> 03:57:46,580
I'm shielding.

5081
03:57:49,960 --> 03:57:51,360
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

5082
03:57:56,020 --> 03:57:57,620
Oh, they're all behind us and they have strange ult.

5083
03:58:00,260 --> 03:58:01,180
Magic ulted.

5084
03:58:02,520 --> 03:58:03,520
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

5085
03:58:05,280 --> 03:58:06,380
Strange, strange, strange.

5086
03:58:06,640 --> 03:58:07,040
Strange one.

5087
03:58:08,940 --> 03:58:09,950
Oh my god!

5088
03:58:11,820 --> 03:58:14,260
Oh my god, we did it!

5089
03:58:14,260 --> 03:58:14,680
Yeah!

5090
03:58:16,960 --> 03:58:18,500
Oh my god!

5091
03:58:20,220 --> 03:58:25,020
Oh, I knew I should have, I should have fucking played Luna in the, at first.

5092
03:58:25,160 --> 03:58:25,880
I, I knew it.

5093
03:58:26,000 --> 03:58:30,020
I was like, I was like, oh, this item does not know how to play Luna.

5094
03:58:33,560 --> 03:58:36,480
Oh, I actually locked in so hard there.

5095
03:58:39,240 --> 03:58:40,960
Booger carried me too.

5096
03:58:41,180 --> 03:58:42,040
Let's go!

5097
03:58:42,040 --> 03:58:44,420
This is why you gotta adopt a tank player.

5098
03:58:46,540 --> 03:58:49,200
You gotta adopt a tank player, guys.

5099
03:58:51,000 --> 03:58:52,320
Tony Florida!

5100
03:58:55,760 --> 03:58:59,900
I got Tony Florida fucking friended me.

5101
03:59:02,460 --> 03:59:04,640
I'm gonna use somebody's bathroom.

5102
03:59:05,200 --> 03:59:07,080
I'm sorry, Tony, I'm sorry, man.

5103
03:59:07,640 --> 03:59:08,260
I can't.

5104
03:59:08,600 --> 03:59:10,040
You get mad too easily.

5105
03:59:59,760 --> 04:00:03,060
Tony just gotta get to rehab and then...

5106
04:00:03,060 --> 04:00:03,720
Who's this?

5107
04:00:05,460 --> 04:00:06,240
Who's this?

5108
04:00:08,500 --> 04:00:08,840
Oh.

5109
04:00:09,920 --> 04:00:11,600
I'll never know!

5110
04:00:18,240 --> 04:00:19,520
Who's this, though?

5111
04:00:20,320 --> 04:00:21,360
I'll never know.

5112
04:00:21,480 --> 04:00:23,800
I mean, EU, obviously, cause of the ping.

5113
04:00:24,620 --> 04:00:25,740
Chibi Doki fan.

5114
04:00:27,640 --> 04:00:28,580
It's Healist?

5115
04:00:29,820 --> 04:00:30,920
Wait, who's Healist?

5116
04:00:31,420 --> 04:00:32,320
I'm sorry!

5117
04:00:33,980 --> 04:00:36,120
I'm sorry, I don't know people.

5118
04:00:37,240 --> 04:00:37,760
Healist.

5119
04:00:37,980 --> 04:00:41,140
I'm sorry, I legitimately don't know anybody.

5120
04:00:41,280 --> 04:00:42,340
I'm so sorry.

5121
04:00:47,900 --> 04:00:48,840
Where is he?

5122
04:00:48,900 --> 04:00:50,240
He's not even on the leaderboard.

5123
04:00:53,760 --> 04:00:56,420
I told you, it's like the Flash meme.

5124
04:00:57,080 --> 04:00:57,680
I'm like...

5125
04:00:57,680 --> 04:01:01,180
You gotta be more specific.

5126
04:01:02,880 --> 04:01:05,380
Alright, educate me on Healist.

5127
04:01:05,980 --> 04:01:07,060
Who he is.

5128
04:01:07,720 --> 04:01:11,640
Bro, I didn't even know who the fuck Mace was until you guys told me who he was.

5129
04:01:12,720 --> 04:01:13,000
Oh.

5130
04:01:14,440 --> 04:01:16,680
With this treasure, I summon...

5131
04:01:19,740 --> 04:01:20,380
I don't...

5132
04:01:20,380 --> 04:01:21,780
No, I'm just ignorant.

5133
04:01:22,240 --> 04:01:25,840
I'm just ignorant.

5134
04:01:25,840 --> 04:01:26,380
I'm just ignorant.

5135
04:01:28,160 --> 04:01:31,740
I didn't even know who Mace was until you guys yelled at me.

5136
04:01:33,700 --> 04:01:34,740
He's rank...

5137
04:01:34,740 --> 04:01:35,820
What's his rank?

5138
04:01:36,040 --> 04:01:36,820
He's rank 21.

5139
04:01:38,140 --> 04:01:38,880
Oh, him.

5140
04:01:39,320 --> 04:01:39,900
It's TTV.

5141
04:01:40,860 --> 04:01:41,720
What does he play?

5142
04:01:41,940 --> 04:01:43,240
Oh, he's a magic player?

5143
04:01:43,440 --> 04:01:46,440
Oh my god, he's a Wolverine magic player?

5144
04:01:46,620 --> 04:01:47,620
Let's fucking go.

5145
04:01:49,540 --> 04:01:50,800
It's a DPS player.

5146
04:01:51,040 --> 04:01:52,140
That's all we needed.

5147
04:01:55,840 --> 04:01:57,260
I'm just ignorant.

5148
04:01:57,840 --> 04:02:02,060
I haven't been in the Overwatch scene for fucking years.

5149
04:02:02,840 --> 04:02:05,660
I didn't even know who Boger was until like...

5150
04:02:05,660 --> 04:02:08,020
Like a month or two ago.

5151
04:02:12,660 --> 04:02:15,960
I literally learned who he was a month or two ago.

5152
04:02:17,840 --> 04:02:19,220
I'm just ignorant.

5153
04:02:20,100 --> 04:02:22,540
How are you an Eternity pro?

5154
04:02:22,800 --> 04:02:24,960
I just played the game.

5155
04:02:28,360 --> 04:02:29,820
I'm just a grinder.

5156
04:02:30,160 --> 04:02:32,140
I'm literally just a grinder.

5157
04:02:32,320 --> 04:02:33,960
I don't fucking do anything else.

5158
04:02:34,060 --> 04:02:35,020
I just play the game.

5159
04:02:41,980 --> 04:02:44,960
I just play the game and be like, whoa.

5160
04:02:45,160 --> 04:02:47,440
I just remember people who say slurs.

5161
04:02:47,720 --> 04:02:50,680
I just remember people who yell at me.

5162
04:02:50,860 --> 04:02:51,600
That's really it.

5163
04:02:52,020 --> 04:02:53,960
Who yell at me and say slurs.

5164
04:02:53,960 --> 04:02:55,720
Because it's very memorable.

5165
04:02:56,120 --> 04:02:58,620
It's incredibly memorable.

5166
04:03:02,160 --> 04:03:03,520
It's true.

5167
04:03:04,600 --> 04:03:05,500
Oh, it's Helis.

5168
04:03:05,620 --> 04:03:06,940
Oh, it's him.

5169
04:03:08,520 --> 04:03:10,980
I still don't know who...

5170
04:03:10,980 --> 04:03:11,640
Is he a...

5171
04:03:11,640 --> 04:03:12,900
Is he like a...

5172
04:03:12,900 --> 04:03:15,320
Is he a Overwatch player?

5173
04:03:17,360 --> 04:03:18,240
Overwatch.

5174
04:03:18,540 --> 04:03:19,200
Helis.

5175
04:03:20,480 --> 04:03:21,760
Can't Google you.

5176
04:03:24,240 --> 04:03:24,840
Let's see.

5177
04:03:25,020 --> 04:03:25,540
Okay, wait.

5178
04:03:25,860 --> 04:03:26,260
Leaderboard.

5179
04:03:27,640 --> 04:03:28,540
We're learning, guys.

5180
04:03:28,640 --> 04:03:29,880
We're educating ourselves.

5181
04:03:30,600 --> 04:03:31,000
Helis.

5182
04:03:31,680 --> 04:03:32,480
Rank 21.

5183
04:03:32,680 --> 04:03:33,680
Did I spell it correctly?

5184
04:03:34,900 --> 04:03:35,300
Helis.

5185
04:03:35,520 --> 04:03:35,920
Overwatch.

5186
04:03:37,740 --> 04:03:38,780
Oh, he has a Twitch?

5187
04:03:39,240 --> 04:03:39,620
Oh, wait.

5188
04:03:39,680 --> 04:03:40,460
His name is TTV.

5189
04:03:40,600 --> 04:03:41,600
His name is literally TTV.

5190
04:03:42,440 --> 04:03:42,940
I'm sorry.

5191
04:03:43,140 --> 04:03:44,160
I'm so stupid.

5192
04:03:47,880 --> 04:03:48,600
Oh, my God.

5193
04:03:48,620 --> 04:03:49,420
He's French.

5194
04:03:49,680 --> 04:03:50,800
I'm not doxing him.

5195
04:03:50,800 --> 04:03:52,060
It's his profile.

5196
04:03:53,700 --> 04:03:55,120
He's French.

5197
04:03:57,840 --> 04:04:00,580
I'm literally just reading his Twitch profile, guys.

5198
04:04:04,520 --> 04:04:07,680
What do you mean by that?

5199
04:04:08,260 --> 04:04:08,520
Wait.

5200
04:04:10,880 --> 04:04:12,840
What do you mean?

5201
04:04:14,440 --> 04:04:15,740
Oh, my God.

5202
04:04:16,020 --> 04:04:17,960
Guys, my chat doesn't...

5203
04:04:17,960 --> 04:04:18,340
Guys.

5204
04:04:18,340 --> 04:04:21,340
Guys, my chat doesn't represent me.

5205
04:04:22,760 --> 04:04:24,340
I won't get better.

5206
04:04:26,140 --> 04:04:27,920
Because I have taken the Twitch Prime.

5207
04:04:28,060 --> 04:04:28,260
Thank you.

5208
04:04:28,320 --> 04:04:29,360
Thank you.

5209
04:04:30,380 --> 04:04:33,440
I've been aware of the curse of France.

5210
04:04:33,800 --> 04:04:36,660
Thank you for the resub for 12 months in a row.

5211
04:04:36,820 --> 04:04:37,080
Thank you.

5212
04:04:37,160 --> 04:04:37,980
Thank you.

5213
04:04:39,400 --> 04:04:39,900
All right.

5214
04:04:40,060 --> 04:04:41,360
I wonder how long the queues will be.

5215
04:04:41,560 --> 04:04:42,720
I'm fine with queuing EU.

5216
04:04:43,400 --> 04:04:43,780
Oh, yeah.

5217
04:04:43,880 --> 04:04:47,640
I'm fine with adding EU to the queues.

5218
04:04:48,340 --> 04:04:49,600
If needed.

5219
04:04:53,360 --> 04:04:58,460
I mean, if it's just me with shit ping, it should be fine.

5220
04:04:59,320 --> 04:04:59,800
Are you sure?

5221
04:05:00,440 --> 04:05:03,420
We can try one game.

5222
04:05:07,020 --> 04:05:10,800
I'm used to 200 ping in Apex.

5223
04:05:14,080 --> 04:05:17,060
How different can it be?

5224
04:05:23,980 --> 04:05:26,140
How different can it be?

5225
04:05:26,240 --> 04:05:27,120
Oh, my God.

5226
04:05:27,220 --> 04:05:28,280
It's one bar.

5227
04:05:32,040 --> 04:05:33,640
Guys, I'll be fine.

5228
04:05:35,720 --> 04:05:37,900
Guys, it'll be fine.

5229
04:05:38,220 --> 04:05:40,140
What's wrong with one bar?

5230
04:05:40,660 --> 04:05:43,940
The way it went to red.

5231
04:05:44,420 --> 04:05:46,600
Guys, it's just one game.

5232
04:05:47,020 --> 04:05:47,680
Maybe.

5233
04:05:48,080 --> 04:05:48,320
It's just one game.

5234
04:05:49,320 --> 04:05:51,400
Guys, it'll be fine.

5235
04:05:54,480 --> 04:05:58,480
No, we don't know yet.

5236
04:05:58,660 --> 04:05:59,380
We don't...

5237
04:05:59,380 --> 04:06:04,820
Even though it says I have one bar, it could mean anything, guys.

5238
04:06:08,220 --> 04:06:09,920
It could mean any...

5239
04:06:09,920 --> 04:06:10,700
Guys, look at...

5240
04:06:10,700 --> 04:06:12,140
Guys, it could mean anything.

5241
04:06:12,900 --> 04:06:13,300
Guys.

5242
04:06:13,300 --> 04:06:19,140
Guys, it just means I have to predict 10 seconds of the future with my Luna ult.

5243
04:06:19,980 --> 04:06:21,420
I mean...

5244
04:06:21,420 --> 04:06:24,100
How game-changing can it really be?

5245
04:06:24,540 --> 04:06:34,560
How game-changing is my Luna ult, which is 12 seconds of actual game-changing...

5246
04:06:36,140 --> 04:06:38,500
Of actual gameplay.

5247
04:06:38,940 --> 04:06:40,620
It can't be that bad.

5248
04:06:41,600 --> 04:06:42,640
Just play...

5249
04:06:42,640 --> 04:06:43,660
Okay, Mantis is worse.

5250
04:06:43,760 --> 04:06:45,200
Mantis, you actually have to aim.

5251
04:06:45,680 --> 04:06:46,120
Like...

5252
04:06:46,120 --> 04:06:49,360
Mantis is projectile, which is even worse with high ping.

5253
04:06:50,280 --> 04:06:52,440
And I send Healist to hell.

5254
04:06:55,440 --> 04:06:57,420
It can't be that bad.

5255
04:06:57,640 --> 04:06:58,520
I believe.

5256
04:06:58,940 --> 04:07:01,100
Rainbow, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

5257
04:07:01,240 --> 04:07:02,020
Thank you, thank you.

5258
04:07:02,040 --> 04:07:03,100
I really appreciate that.

5259
04:07:03,180 --> 04:07:05,860
How could you do that to ChibiDokiFan?

5260
04:07:06,220 --> 04:07:07,920
It's because you're not...

5261
04:07:07,920 --> 04:07:10,120
You're not DokiFan69.

5262
04:07:11,380 --> 04:07:11,940
LOL

5263
04:07:16,400 --> 04:07:16,960
Wow.

5264
04:07:18,280 --> 04:07:19,020
That's right.

5265
04:07:21,560 --> 04:07:25,720
I need 20 blue essence for a real rename.

5266
04:07:28,000 --> 04:07:29,980
Raging, thank you for tier 1 sub.

5267
04:07:30,060 --> 04:07:30,740
Thank you, thank you.

5268
04:07:30,860 --> 04:07:34,820
Not even gonna spend money for the privilege.

5269
04:07:35,980 --> 04:07:37,660
LOL Shake.

5270
04:07:38,100 --> 04:07:40,340
I think I spelled privilege wrong, but I can't be bothered.

5271
04:07:41,040 --> 04:07:44,620
LOL So cheap.

5272
04:07:45,300 --> 04:07:47,300
I don't have a fucking spellchecker.

5273
04:07:47,660 --> 04:07:49,840
You can tell what I wrote.

5274
04:07:50,020 --> 04:07:50,780
English is my...

5275
04:07:51,720 --> 04:07:53,600
English is my first language.

5276
04:07:55,680 --> 04:07:58,460
Spend some money for real, for real.

5277
04:08:00,880 --> 04:08:02,840
I can't believe it, guys.

5278
04:08:03,040 --> 04:08:04,060
Shake my head.

5279
04:08:04,320 --> 04:08:06,300
Not even gonna spend money.

5280
04:08:08,740 --> 04:08:11,360
LOL No, I'm EFL.

5281
04:08:11,860 --> 04:08:13,140
English first language.

5282
04:08:14,620 --> 04:08:17,740
LOL Hmm.

5283
04:08:18,140 --> 04:08:20,280
LOL This is...

5284
04:08:21,060 --> 04:08:23,320
If you wanna piss somebody off, just write hmm.

5285
04:08:24,560 --> 04:08:25,280
LOL

5286
04:08:28,340 --> 04:08:31,460
Shake my head, fake DokiFan.

5287
04:08:31,800 --> 04:08:34,780
That actually pisses people off so much in conversations.

5288
04:08:35,580 --> 04:08:37,020
So mean.

5289
04:08:37,680 --> 04:08:38,240
LOL Hmm.

5290
04:08:39,760 --> 04:08:43,100
LOL LOL

5291
04:08:46,980 --> 04:08:48,680
Because you don't even give them...

5292
04:08:48,680 --> 04:08:49,960
You want me to go to practice range?

5293
04:08:50,160 --> 04:08:50,880
Oh yeah, we should.

5294
04:08:51,060 --> 04:08:51,620
We should see.

5295
04:08:52,080 --> 04:08:53,300
You'll say, oh I can say...

5296
04:08:53,300 --> 04:08:54,180
I've never done that before.

5297
04:08:54,360 --> 04:08:55,640
I've never been in a queue that long.

5298
04:08:58,860 --> 04:09:01,060
I've never been in a queue so long that I have to...

5299
04:09:01,060 --> 04:09:02,060
Wait, why is he here?

5300
04:09:02,800 --> 04:09:04,420
LOL Why is he here?

5301
04:09:04,680 --> 04:09:05,460
Alright, let's see.

5302
04:09:05,460 --> 04:09:07,000
I'm just saying I'm pink.

5303
04:09:07,060 --> 04:09:07,780
It can't be bad.

5304
04:09:07,940 --> 04:09:08,540
Look at that.

5305
04:09:08,620 --> 04:09:09,560
It's hitscan.

5306
04:09:12,740 --> 04:09:15,440
Guys, ignore what you just saw there.

5307
04:09:17,860 --> 04:09:18,420
Ignore...

5308
04:09:18,420 --> 04:09:19,440
See everything...

5309
04:09:19,440 --> 04:09:21,520
Oh my, I see everything is fine.

5310
04:09:22,380 --> 04:09:22,940
See?

5311
04:09:23,520 --> 04:09:24,080
Look at that.

5312
04:09:24,400 --> 04:09:26,040
Look, I can heal him.

5313
04:09:26,280 --> 04:09:26,720
Look at that.

5314
04:09:28,500 --> 04:09:31,240
That was just a minor bug.

5315
04:09:31,360 --> 04:09:32,800
It was not related to pink.

5316
04:09:32,800 --> 04:09:35,820
It was perfectly normal, guys.

5317
04:09:36,180 --> 04:09:36,700
Look at that.

5318
04:09:37,100 --> 04:09:38,060
Look at that.

5319
04:09:38,640 --> 04:09:39,720
Perfectly normal.

5320
04:09:40,380 --> 04:09:40,740
See?

5321
04:09:41,200 --> 04:09:42,040
We're fine.

5322
04:09:42,120 --> 04:09:43,380
We're not TPing at all.

5323
04:09:43,880 --> 04:09:45,080
No, no, you saw nothing.

5324
04:09:45,300 --> 04:09:45,600
I don't...

5325
04:09:45,600 --> 04:09:45,840
I don't...

5326
04:09:45,840 --> 04:09:46,540
There's no...

5327
04:09:46,540 --> 04:09:48,360
No TPing in Ba Sing Se.

5328
04:09:51,800 --> 04:09:53,020
Sorry, my...

5329
04:09:53,020 --> 04:09:53,800
My frame...

5330
04:09:53,800 --> 04:09:54,060
I...

5331
04:09:54,060 --> 04:09:55,580
I dropped frames there.

5332
04:09:55,860 --> 04:09:56,860
That was not TPing.

5333
04:09:56,960 --> 04:09:59,020
Just a minor drop of frames right there.

5334
04:09:59,640 --> 04:10:00,440
Which is...

5335
04:10:00,440 --> 04:10:04,320
LOL See?

5336
04:10:04,480 --> 04:10:05,460
Everything is fine.

5337
04:10:05,580 --> 04:10:06,080
Look at that.

5338
04:10:07,140 --> 04:10:08,140
Look at that.

5339
04:10:08,400 --> 04:10:09,500
What do you mean there's no delay?

5340
04:10:09,960 --> 04:10:11,960
Everything looks great on my end.

5341
04:10:12,060 --> 04:10:12,520
Look, see?

5342
04:10:13,680 --> 04:10:15,240
Everything looks A-OK.

5343
04:10:16,940 --> 04:10:17,560
Look at that.

5344
04:10:18,300 --> 04:10:18,820
No TPing.

5345
04:10:20,140 --> 04:10:22,020
Everything looks fine.

5346
04:10:23,560 --> 04:10:25,300
Where the fuck is my EU game?

5347
04:10:26,320 --> 04:10:29,000
Where the fuck is my EU game?

5348
04:10:29,100 --> 04:10:29,680
Right here.

5349
04:10:29,980 --> 04:10:32,120
No, we're not at 182 pink.

5350
04:10:32,120 --> 04:10:34,440
I don't know where you guys get that number from.

5351
04:10:35,080 --> 04:10:36,120
Guys, I don't...

5352
04:10:38,520 --> 04:10:41,120
Guys, I have no idea...

5353
04:10:42,240 --> 04:10:44,080
Where you get that number from.

5354
04:10:44,180 --> 04:10:47,160
I don't know where it could be.

5355
04:10:50,550 --> 04:10:51,190
Look at that.

5356
04:10:58,890 --> 04:11:00,830
Oh my god, it's like crazy.

5357
04:11:01,210 --> 04:11:02,010
My one ping.

5358
04:11:04,090 --> 04:11:04,710
LOL

5359
04:11:07,790 --> 04:11:11,250
Oh my god, I live right next to the server, guys.

5360
04:11:11,790 --> 04:11:12,990
You can't kick me.

5361
04:11:13,290 --> 04:11:13,970
Oh, true.

5362
04:11:14,210 --> 04:11:15,010
I mean...

5363
04:11:15,850 --> 04:11:16,910
He's right.

5364
04:11:19,290 --> 04:11:23,550
LOL He's right.

5365
04:11:26,090 --> 04:11:28,010
Why is the G red?

5366
04:11:28,330 --> 04:11:29,950
What are you talking about?

5367
04:11:30,050 --> 04:11:30,830
There was no G.

5368
04:11:32,010 --> 04:11:32,850
What are you...

5369
04:11:32,850 --> 04:11:34,670
LOL What are you trying to say?

5370
04:11:34,730 --> 04:11:35,710
There's no G anywhere.

5371
04:11:36,670 --> 04:11:37,310
There we go.

5372
04:11:38,050 --> 04:11:38,990
Oh my god, guys.

5373
04:11:39,050 --> 04:11:40,730
I literally live next to the server.

5374
04:11:42,070 --> 04:11:42,630
LOL

5375
04:11:46,510 --> 04:11:48,010
There we go.

5376
04:11:50,750 --> 04:11:51,810
This is that easy.

5377
04:11:53,830 --> 04:11:56,510
I just wanted people to play with.

5378
04:11:58,230 --> 04:11:59,570
You're just too good.

5379
04:12:00,490 --> 04:12:01,710
You should de-rank.

5380
04:12:03,010 --> 04:12:03,490
LOL

5381
04:12:09,110 --> 04:12:11,030
Oh shit, we got in!

5382
04:12:11,830 --> 04:12:14,050
If he de-ranked, we had faster queues.

5383
04:12:14,130 --> 04:12:15,090
That's all I'm saying.

5384
04:12:16,890 --> 04:12:17,630
That's all I'm fucking...

5385
04:12:17,630 --> 04:12:19,010
Oh my god, he's back.

5386
04:12:19,570 --> 04:12:20,750
Rosa is back.

5387
04:12:26,930 --> 04:12:28,050
Oh wait, you're right.

5388
04:12:28,110 --> 04:12:28,890
They have Rosa.

5389
04:12:28,890 --> 04:12:31,650
We should just ban them.

5390
04:12:32,170 --> 04:12:32,690
You're right.

5391
04:12:33,310 --> 04:12:35,250
With this treasure, I summon the psychic.

5392
04:12:41,870 --> 04:12:42,470
Guys!

5393
04:12:46,730 --> 04:12:48,390
Okay, we're in NA servers though.

5394
04:12:48,790 --> 04:12:50,370
Should have poached him.

5395
04:12:52,130 --> 04:12:54,350
Yeah, but I'm Doki Bridgefan69.

5396
04:12:55,250 --> 04:12:57,450
Now I have a real, a true bro.

5397
04:12:58,710 --> 04:13:03,270
If Rosa wants to join this stack, he should be Doki Bridgefan68.

5398
04:13:05,990 --> 04:13:08,610
LOL Is it NA or...

5399
04:13:10,570 --> 04:13:13,970
If he truly wants to...

5400
04:13:13,970 --> 04:13:14,910
Hell yeah, brother.

5401
04:13:17,650 --> 04:13:18,050
Alright.

5402
04:13:19,450 --> 04:13:20,330
Are we banning?

5403
04:13:20,430 --> 04:13:20,850
Okay, hello.

5404
04:13:22,890 --> 04:13:24,150
Is he not?

5405
04:13:24,230 --> 04:13:24,770
That is true.

5406
04:13:24,890 --> 04:13:26,910
He is a Starlord main on his other account.

5407
04:13:29,190 --> 04:13:29,790
Damn.

5408
04:13:29,790 --> 04:13:29,910
Damn.

5409
04:13:31,230 --> 04:13:32,070
Stream sniping.

5410
04:13:32,850 --> 04:13:34,070
There's no way.

5411
04:13:34,490 --> 04:13:35,090
Like...

5412
04:13:35,750 --> 04:13:37,590
How would you know?

5413
04:13:39,010 --> 04:13:40,530
There's no way.

5414
04:13:43,310 --> 04:13:44,570
There's no way.

5415
04:13:44,670 --> 04:13:45,890
How would you fucking...

5416
04:13:45,890 --> 04:13:47,750
Who would you think is playing the Wolverine?

5417
04:13:47,910 --> 04:13:52,090
Like, you see Doki Bridgefan69, you automatically assume he's a Wolverine player.

5418
04:13:53,070 --> 04:13:54,150
There's no way.

5419
04:13:54,330 --> 04:13:54,790
He pulled up...

5420
04:13:54,790 --> 04:13:56,110
Somebody pulled up the stream.

5421
04:13:56,110 --> 04:13:58,610
There's somebody pulled up the stream.

5422
04:13:59,650 --> 04:14:01,970
It's okay, I have a guy with no hands on record.

5423
04:14:04,050 --> 04:14:06,310
Like, it's literally just name change.

5424
04:14:06,530 --> 04:14:07,490
How would you know?

5425
04:14:09,130 --> 04:14:10,450
He just...

5426
04:14:10,450 --> 04:14:13,550
This is his first game as Doki Bridgefan69.

5427
04:14:13,910 --> 04:14:15,050
How would you know?

5428
04:14:19,230 --> 04:14:21,370
His first fucking game.

5429
04:14:26,310 --> 04:14:28,230
But what if we don't kill him?

5430
04:14:29,970 --> 04:14:31,050
It's a 50-50.

5431
04:14:31,170 --> 04:14:32,130
Where do we begin to lose?

5432
04:14:33,410 --> 04:14:36,490
What if he gets his ult after that?

5433
04:14:38,090 --> 04:14:39,550
Listen, it's 50-50.

5434
04:14:39,850 --> 04:14:41,090
I've made the calculations.

5435
04:14:42,510 --> 04:14:44,250
I'm gonna TP, I'm gonna TP, I'm gonna TP.

5436
04:14:44,290 --> 04:14:46,290
Not in front of me, I'm gonna TP on the side.

5437
04:14:47,510 --> 04:14:48,010
I'm scared.

5438
04:14:48,870 --> 04:14:49,910
The Starlord's looking.

5439
04:14:51,470 --> 04:14:52,570
The Starlord is Rosa.

5440
04:14:52,570 --> 04:14:55,310
Okay guys, get ready.

5441
04:14:55,510 --> 04:14:56,530
3, 2, 1.

5442
04:14:59,350 --> 04:14:59,990
I'm in.

5443
04:15:04,230 --> 04:15:06,170
Oh my god, we got picked, we got picked.

5444
04:15:11,850 --> 04:15:15,630
I can't see over there.

5445
04:15:17,010 --> 04:15:18,190
We have Resvee.

5446
04:15:18,390 --> 04:15:23,670
I have Psylocke on me.

5447
04:15:26,590 --> 04:15:27,950
Oh my god.

5448
04:15:28,050 --> 04:15:29,170
Listen, we lost the 50-50.

5449
04:15:30,390 --> 04:15:30,730
Oh no.

5450
04:15:31,470 --> 04:15:33,670
I think he might have ult now.

5451
04:15:38,310 --> 04:15:40,850
Oh, he definitely has ult.

5452
04:15:43,590 --> 04:15:45,110
Oh my god!

5453
04:15:46,870 --> 04:15:47,450
Guys, we need to go.

5454
04:15:47,490 --> 04:15:48,650
We got it, we got it, we got Starlord.

5455
04:15:49,010 --> 04:15:49,270
Yep.

5456
04:15:50,130 --> 04:15:50,410
Nice.

5457
04:15:53,410 --> 04:15:54,650
We need to go on the backline, guys.

5458
04:15:54,730 --> 04:15:54,990
Support.

5459
04:15:55,330 --> 04:15:56,610
I think their Luna has ult.

5460
04:15:57,010 --> 04:15:57,970
If you focus her really hard.

5461
04:15:58,830 --> 04:15:59,390
Yeah, yeah.

5462
04:15:59,470 --> 04:16:00,070
I'm coming back.

5463
04:16:00,330 --> 04:16:01,170
I'm almost there, I'm almost there.

5464
04:16:01,590 --> 04:16:02,150
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

5465
04:16:02,810 --> 04:16:03,370
Go, go, go.

5466
04:16:03,370 --> 04:16:06,810
Oh my god, I'm a little scared because I used my clap prematurely.

5467
04:16:07,950 --> 04:16:09,010
Their Starlord is back, I think.

5468
04:16:09,630 --> 04:16:11,790
I have a Psylocke on me and he's frozen.

5469
04:16:14,410 --> 04:16:14,890
Psylocke one.

5470
04:16:16,050 --> 04:16:17,030
I can do this.

5471
04:16:17,250 --> 04:16:17,990
Psylocke low, Psylocke low.

5472
04:16:18,150 --> 04:16:18,730
Starlord's low.

5473
04:16:18,730 --> 04:16:18,990
Nice.

5474
04:16:19,250 --> 04:16:20,290
I got her, I got her, I got her, I got her.

5475
04:16:20,430 --> 04:16:21,790
I have bubble soon, I have bubble soon.

5476
04:16:21,990 --> 04:16:22,470
I have bubble B.

5477
04:16:23,510 --> 04:16:24,990
He has ult, he has ult, he has ult.

5478
04:16:25,570 --> 04:16:26,850
I don't have ult here.

5479
04:16:26,970 --> 04:16:27,770
Throw this one, throw this one.

5480
04:16:27,890 --> 04:16:29,750
There's not enough healing, there's not enough healing to sustain him.

5481
04:16:37,190 --> 04:16:39,990
It's so hard to farm ult with one tank.

5482
04:16:40,330 --> 04:16:41,250
They have Luna ult too.

5483
04:16:41,710 --> 04:16:42,750
Guys, I might be cooked here.

5484
04:16:43,190 --> 04:16:43,810
Oh, goodbye.

5485
04:16:44,190 --> 04:16:44,490
I'm good.

5486
04:16:44,990 --> 04:16:45,770
I'm still good.

5487
04:16:48,770 --> 04:16:49,510
Yeah, they have Luna.

5488
04:16:50,550 --> 04:16:51,650
I have mine too.

5489
04:16:51,730 --> 04:16:52,470
Oh, actually they swapped.

5490
04:16:52,570 --> 04:16:53,330
Wait, they swapped the Luna.

5491
04:16:53,810 --> 04:16:54,870
Oh, they swapped Luna, yeah?

5492
04:16:55,010 --> 04:16:55,130
Yeah.

5493
04:16:59,630 --> 04:17:00,690
I froze somebody.

5494
04:17:14,250 --> 04:17:14,890
They have...

5495
04:17:16,230 --> 04:17:16,950
They have my needle.

5496
04:17:23,860 --> 04:17:24,880
We're meeting Kai.

5497
04:17:26,080 --> 04:17:26,960
Oh, nice ult.

5498
04:17:30,840 --> 04:17:32,240
I'm ult after my needle.

5499
04:17:33,060 --> 04:17:33,460
I'm ulting.

5500
04:17:39,460 --> 04:17:41,960
I'm going to be on my needle for my ult.

5501
04:17:42,600 --> 04:17:45,060
3, 2, 1, no more.

5502
04:17:45,300 --> 04:17:46,380
They have Starlight ult here.

5503
04:17:51,220 --> 04:17:52,500
Oh, I couldn't.

5504
04:17:53,860 --> 04:17:54,380
They're killing everyone.

5505
04:17:56,540 --> 04:17:57,060
Yeah.

5506
04:17:58,560 --> 04:18:00,000
They have no support though.

5507
04:18:00,680 --> 04:18:03,860
Here we go.

5508
04:18:05,980 --> 04:18:06,960
That's Rosa.

5509
04:18:07,980 --> 04:18:09,760
Yeah, at least there's no again, you know?

5510
04:18:11,260 --> 04:18:14,480
It's the little things, guys.

5511
04:18:16,040 --> 04:18:18,260
I don't know, but we have a free silo.

5512
04:18:18,260 --> 04:18:19,780
Yeah, we shouldn't use it.

5513
04:18:22,900 --> 04:18:24,020
Jesus Christ.

5514
04:18:26,500 --> 04:18:30,760
Jesus Christ, everybody is taking so much damage.

5515
04:18:31,420 --> 04:18:33,100
Oh, I'm dead here.

5516
04:18:34,280 --> 04:18:35,000
I got...

5517
04:18:35,000 --> 04:18:36,900
I got Psylocke ulted.

5518
04:18:37,860 --> 04:18:38,500
Psylocke's low.

5519
04:18:41,380 --> 04:18:42,580
Magnus one, Magnus one.

5520
04:18:43,000 --> 04:18:44,100
Mag one, Mag one, Mag one.

5521
04:18:44,100 --> 04:18:46,760
I need support, I need support, I need support.

5522
04:18:47,820 --> 04:18:49,300
I just got one, by the way.

5523
04:18:49,700 --> 04:18:50,320
Zylo also one.

5524
04:18:52,480 --> 04:18:53,320
Zylo one HP on the left.

5525
04:18:53,480 --> 04:18:54,200
One HP, Kali one.

5526
04:18:59,020 --> 04:18:59,940
Psylocke one, Psylocke one.

5527
04:19:04,400 --> 04:19:06,340
Trying to keep you up, but I have to reload soon.

5528
04:19:10,160 --> 04:19:10,880
I'm 90.

5529
04:19:14,160 --> 04:19:14,880
I can't.

5530
04:19:17,040 --> 04:19:18,920
Oh, I was so close.

5531
04:19:19,260 --> 04:19:21,060
I was so close to being alive.

5532
04:19:29,180 --> 04:19:31,120
I couldn't be alive.

5533
04:19:32,900 --> 04:19:33,900
I think we can full ult them.

5534
04:19:34,640 --> 04:19:36,280
I think these guys are good players.

5535
04:19:38,240 --> 04:19:39,500
I told you guys.

5536
04:19:45,740 --> 04:19:46,880
Guys, I just think...

5537
04:19:50,600 --> 04:19:54,880
I respect her.

5538
04:19:56,080 --> 04:19:56,800
There is purpose.

5539
04:19:57,460 --> 04:19:58,420
Play Raccoon, bro.

5540
04:19:58,460 --> 04:19:59,040
Play your character.

5541
04:19:59,200 --> 04:19:59,800
I'm not bullying you.

5542
04:20:00,460 --> 04:20:02,860
I'm really the player.

5543
04:20:04,920 --> 04:20:06,300
I'm very normal, by the way.

5544
04:20:06,520 --> 04:20:07,940
Defense is very...

5545
04:20:07,940 --> 04:20:08,240
Artificial.

5546
04:20:08,900 --> 04:20:09,000
Artificial.

5547
04:20:10,840 --> 04:20:12,420
You have to pick Black Widow and stuff.

5548
04:20:14,160 --> 04:20:15,260
The Black Widow will work.

5549
04:20:15,480 --> 04:20:17,200
He wake up every day.

5550
04:20:19,980 --> 04:20:21,640
No, no, but he's right.

5551
04:20:21,940 --> 04:20:22,820
I am here.

5552
04:20:22,900 --> 04:20:24,560
I'm a fucking Raccoon auntie.

5553
04:20:24,700 --> 04:20:26,300
I'm gonna fucking call the animal control.

5554
04:20:27,480 --> 04:20:28,400
I'm gonna call...

5555
04:20:29,400 --> 04:20:33,020
Apparently, Rose has a smurf account for a rank 16 player.

5556
04:20:34,300 --> 04:20:36,400
I mean, if he's hacking, then like...

5557
04:20:36,400 --> 04:20:38,880
He must have paid a lot of money for it.

5558
04:20:38,900 --> 04:20:39,800
Or he's testing a...

5559
04:20:39,800 --> 04:20:41,680
Or he's testing a hack.

5560
04:20:41,820 --> 04:20:42,960
But he's in a tournament.

5561
04:20:43,360 --> 04:20:44,200
That's what I'm thinking.

5562
04:20:45,060 --> 04:20:48,680
How would he fucking get through that in a tournament setting?

5563
04:20:50,020 --> 04:20:54,640
How do you get through that far in a tournament without being caught?

5564
04:20:57,680 --> 04:20:58,780
Don't mind me.

5565
04:20:58,800 --> 04:21:00,620
Is he in the semi-finals?

5566
04:21:01,120 --> 04:21:01,980
Okay, they're looking back, right?

5567
04:21:05,040 --> 04:21:05,400
Oh...

5568
04:21:05,400 --> 04:21:06,300
Yeah, well...

5569
04:21:07,520 --> 04:21:08,240
That's unlucky.

5570
04:21:08,920 --> 04:21:09,540
We got the res though.

5571
04:21:13,320 --> 04:21:14,360
Someone behind flanking.

5572
04:21:14,580 --> 04:21:15,940
Yeah, I might be dead.

5573
04:21:16,020 --> 04:21:16,280
I might be dead.

5574
04:21:16,320 --> 04:21:16,900
He's low, he's low though.

5575
04:21:18,320 --> 04:21:19,020
I'm gonna speed up.

5576
04:21:19,840 --> 04:21:20,240
I'm pushing this.

5577
04:21:20,700 --> 04:21:22,060
There's a Psylocke in spawn.

5578
04:21:22,380 --> 04:21:23,380
I need help, guys.

5579
04:21:23,560 --> 04:21:23,880
I need help.

5580
04:21:23,880 --> 04:21:24,700
I'm looking, I'm looking.

5581
04:21:24,700 --> 04:21:25,440
I'm healing, I'm healing you.

5582
04:21:37,380 --> 04:21:38,060
Someone's to my left.

5583
04:21:38,180 --> 04:21:38,780
Psylocke's to my left.

5584
04:21:39,280 --> 04:21:39,600
I bubbled.

5585
04:21:39,640 --> 04:21:40,340
I exposed her.

5586
04:21:40,520 --> 04:21:41,460
But I have to back out.

5587
04:21:55,140 --> 04:21:56,020
We have res.

5588
04:21:56,520 --> 04:21:57,260
I have to reload.

5589
04:21:59,620 --> 04:22:00,340
I might have.

5590
04:22:04,740 --> 04:22:06,720
I'm only 78 of off.

5591
04:22:11,520 --> 04:22:12,500
This is awkward.

5592
04:22:12,740 --> 04:22:13,160
97.

5593
04:22:16,260 --> 04:22:17,620
I'm ulting the moment I get it.

5594
04:22:19,680 --> 04:22:21,600
They're gonna Starlord ult after this though.

5595
04:22:22,860 --> 04:22:24,000
I have my ult for it.

5596
04:22:24,140 --> 04:22:24,880
I'll be saving it.

5597
04:22:25,860 --> 04:22:27,520
I need to get a Mantis.

5598
04:22:28,280 --> 04:22:30,100
I have two, one, zero.

5599
04:22:31,620 --> 04:22:33,280
Oh, there it is.

5600
04:22:33,420 --> 04:22:33,900
Aww.

5601
04:22:36,080 --> 04:22:37,740
I need to do a Q already.

5602
04:22:41,580 --> 04:22:42,860
That sucks.

5603
04:22:42,940 --> 04:22:43,700
Our Raccoon.

5604
04:22:44,820 --> 04:22:46,980
We need a double support ult.

5605
04:22:47,400 --> 04:22:49,240
We have a Raccoon ult.

5606
04:22:49,500 --> 04:22:49,820
Yeah.

5607
04:22:50,380 --> 04:22:52,960
The Raccoon is not it.

5608
04:22:53,960 --> 04:22:55,380
Just a moment.

5609
04:22:55,680 --> 04:22:58,140
Let me avoid real quick.

5610
04:23:03,460 --> 04:23:05,640
Yeah, the res had no value.

5611
04:23:06,160 --> 04:23:06,520
Damn.

5612
04:23:06,660 --> 04:23:08,500
Right in front of our Raccoon player.

5613
04:23:08,940 --> 04:23:10,220
That's rough, buddy.

5614
04:23:10,800 --> 04:23:12,200
That's fucking rough.

5615
04:23:19,080 --> 04:23:20,480
No, Raccoon.

5616
04:23:24,200 --> 04:23:31,760
I didn't mean to rank on my team, guys.

5617
04:23:32,120 --> 04:23:36,140
I didn't mean that, guys.

5618
04:23:36,380 --> 04:23:38,940
I didn't mean to rank on my team.

5619
04:23:42,100 --> 04:23:42,940
We good.

5620
04:23:43,320 --> 04:23:43,640
Doki.

5621
04:23:43,960 --> 04:23:44,600
That's me.

5622
04:23:45,220 --> 04:23:46,020
That's me.

5623
04:23:50,660 --> 04:23:52,340
Why did you say Doki?

5624
04:23:52,960 --> 04:23:54,860
Alright, what is Mantis like with one ping?

5625
04:23:56,080 --> 04:23:58,060
You wanna hear a joke about ghosts?

5626
04:23:59,040 --> 04:23:59,360
Sure.

5627
04:24:02,460 --> 04:24:03,100
See?

5628
04:24:03,380 --> 04:24:04,880
Look at my one ping.

5629
04:24:07,020 --> 04:24:08,820
Sure, that's the spirit.

5630
04:24:09,120 --> 04:24:10,340
Is he a dad?

5631
04:24:13,680 --> 04:24:18,040
Look at that.

5632
04:24:19,960 --> 04:24:20,680
Oh my god.

5633
04:24:20,940 --> 04:24:22,300
This is truly one ping.

5634
04:24:22,300 --> 04:24:23,580
One ping.

5635
04:24:23,720 --> 04:24:24,440
Right there.

5636
04:24:25,860 --> 04:24:27,740
One ping gameplay right there.

5637
04:24:28,540 --> 04:24:29,440
Look at that.

5638
04:24:30,140 --> 04:24:32,160
Oh my god.

5639
04:24:32,240 --> 04:24:33,120
That was fast.

5640
04:24:37,600 --> 04:24:38,300
Oh, hey.

5641
04:24:38,360 --> 04:24:38,740
It's NA.

5642
04:24:40,980 --> 04:24:41,700
It's NA.

5643
04:24:43,700 --> 04:24:44,700
Oh my god.

5644
04:24:44,700 --> 04:24:45,460
It's Mack.

5645
04:24:48,960 --> 04:24:50,320
Oh, it's Deathcoder.

5646
04:24:52,480 --> 04:24:52,920
Oh, wait.

5647
04:24:52,980 --> 04:24:53,760
Shasta Cola?

5648
04:24:53,760 --> 04:24:54,760
I mean...

5649
04:24:55,500 --> 04:24:57,240
We have Deathcoke on Luna, guys.

5650
04:24:57,300 --> 04:24:58,220
I think we win this game.

5651
04:24:58,620 --> 04:25:00,140
And we have Shasta and Death.

5652
04:25:01,000 --> 04:25:03,000
Who the fuck do a support kill?

5653
04:25:03,340 --> 04:25:04,220
Like, how do you do it?

5654
04:25:06,340 --> 04:25:07,220
We have Mack.

5655
04:25:07,340 --> 04:25:07,620
Oh, yeah.

5656
04:25:07,680 --> 04:25:08,060
I don't.

5657
04:25:08,600 --> 04:25:09,200
I was gonna say...

5658
04:25:09,200 --> 04:25:10,340
Is there like Slash Whisper?

5659
04:25:14,360 --> 04:25:15,980
If he was a homie, he'd throw it.

5660
04:25:15,980 --> 04:25:16,500
Poker, what do you play?

5661
04:25:19,220 --> 04:25:20,440
I don't even know.

5662
04:25:21,840 --> 04:25:23,460
Mack, play Backpather.

5663
04:25:23,700 --> 04:25:25,180
Mack, play Backpather.

5664
04:25:25,840 --> 04:25:26,660
I don't know about that.

5665
04:25:33,600 --> 04:25:34,800
Play Backpather.

5666
04:25:35,660 --> 04:25:37,340
I know you want to.

5667
04:25:37,360 --> 04:25:39,340
What are we gonna do if Deathcode is not on Luna?

5668
04:25:41,320 --> 04:25:43,380
Pull out the storm, Mack.

5669
04:25:43,640 --> 04:25:45,120
Pull out the storm!

5670
04:25:46,700 --> 04:25:47,680
Adam Moloch, maybe?

5671
04:25:52,280 --> 04:25:53,320
Also, Arrow!

5672
04:25:53,660 --> 04:25:54,600
Thank you for the raid!

5673
04:25:54,720 --> 04:25:55,880
Thank you!

5674
04:25:56,720 --> 04:25:58,060
I appreciate it.

5675
04:26:01,180 --> 04:26:03,640
If you guys are new here, my name is Doki Bird.

5676
04:26:03,700 --> 04:26:06,820
I usually stream on YouTube, but I'm here on Twitch for the ranked grind.

5677
04:26:09,340 --> 04:26:10,660
I think like...

5678
04:26:10,660 --> 04:26:11,800
I think I'm making...

5679
04:26:11,800 --> 04:26:13,680
Am I like up two games, I think?

5680
04:26:13,820 --> 04:26:15,160
I think I'm up two games right now.

5681
04:26:15,160 --> 04:26:17,260
It's been four hours and I'm up two games.

5682
04:26:24,180 --> 04:26:25,320
We can't lose.

5683
04:26:26,640 --> 04:26:28,000
How much am I up?

5684
04:26:28,040 --> 04:26:28,880
I don't even know.

5685
04:26:29,060 --> 04:26:30,040
Technically, it's possible.

5686
04:26:30,200 --> 04:26:31,600
Am I up two or three games?

5687
04:26:32,360 --> 04:26:34,220
Sounds like an absolute dub.

5688
04:26:37,660 --> 04:26:40,540
Every time I lose, I had Rosa on the enemy team.

5689
04:26:40,540 --> 04:26:44,700
This time, we won't lose because we have the Logang.

5690
04:26:44,920 --> 04:26:45,960
Logang is going to go in.

5691
04:26:46,280 --> 04:26:47,240
Yeah, yeah, I believe.

5692
04:26:49,620 --> 04:26:54,260
Guys, I might be up two or three games.

5693
04:26:54,420 --> 04:26:54,980
I don't know.

5694
04:26:55,380 --> 04:26:57,540
It was just a Rosa debuff for women everywhere.

5695
04:27:06,240 --> 04:27:08,100
I'm placing it on the right.

5696
04:27:10,060 --> 04:27:10,980
I'm scouting.

5697
04:27:11,360 --> 04:27:12,800
I don't think Moon Knight is good for this map.

5698
04:27:13,060 --> 04:27:13,720
Oh, we have Groot.

5699
04:27:14,460 --> 04:27:15,480
Groot, Moon Knight.

5700
04:27:15,820 --> 04:27:17,060
Okay, three, two, one.

5701
04:27:17,300 --> 04:27:18,440
It's right behind them.

5702
04:27:18,500 --> 04:27:19,440
It's right behind them.

5703
04:27:20,080 --> 04:27:20,740
I'm looking.

5704
04:27:21,700 --> 04:27:21,960
Alright.

5705
04:27:23,800 --> 04:27:24,560
It's fine.

5706
04:27:24,660 --> 04:27:25,240
I have...

5707
04:27:28,940 --> 04:27:31,580
Oh my god.

5708
04:27:32,220 --> 04:27:33,260
He's asleep, he's asleep.

5709
04:27:35,180 --> 04:27:36,300
What the fuck?

5710
04:27:36,300 --> 04:27:37,940
I got hooked.

5711
04:27:38,300 --> 04:27:39,260
You're down too.

5712
04:27:45,560 --> 04:27:47,860
I don't know if he lives.

5713
04:27:48,180 --> 04:27:49,420
I am Groot.

5714
04:27:49,500 --> 04:27:50,500
We're coming back from main.

5715
04:27:50,820 --> 04:27:51,340
We need heals.

5716
04:27:51,740 --> 04:27:52,160
Guys, go main.

5717
04:27:53,340 --> 04:27:53,820
Okay,

5718
04:27:57,140 --> 04:27:57,920
we got some space though.

5719
04:27:58,800 --> 04:28:00,360
Oh, Magno, Magno one.

5720
04:28:01,140 --> 04:28:01,900
Cloak, cloak, cloak, cloak.

5721
04:28:02,400 --> 04:28:03,360
Cloak, cloak, cloak, cloak.

5722
04:28:05,280 --> 04:28:05,920
He's so low.

5723
04:28:05,940 --> 04:28:06,900
Cloak is one, he'll be up here.

5724
04:28:07,360 --> 04:28:07,920
Adam, Adam.

5725
04:28:08,400 --> 04:28:09,660
One, one, one, Adam, Adam.

5726
04:28:10,720 --> 04:28:11,500
Cloak one, cloak one, cloak one.

5727
04:28:11,580 --> 04:28:12,440
Adam is respawning.

5728
04:28:12,720 --> 04:28:13,360
Cocooning, cocooning.

5729
04:28:15,480 --> 04:28:15,800
Asleep.

5730
04:28:16,300 --> 04:28:16,700
One, one, one.

5731
04:28:18,460 --> 04:28:19,120
He's so low.

5732
04:28:19,220 --> 04:28:19,820
He's really low.

5733
04:28:22,240 --> 04:28:23,380
I can't believe that that worked.

5734
04:28:23,720 --> 04:28:24,820
Me and Cloak just went in there.

5735
04:28:27,100 --> 04:28:27,420
They...

5736
04:28:27,420 --> 04:28:28,780
They Starlord ulted though.

5737
04:28:28,920 --> 04:28:29,060
Yeah.

5738
04:28:29,380 --> 04:28:30,440
Enemy in front of us.

5739
04:28:30,620 --> 04:28:31,680
Yeah, no rest Starlord, no heal.

5740
04:28:33,080 --> 04:28:35,540
Yeah, they might be close to Bucky ult.

5741
04:28:41,800 --> 04:28:42,420
Oh my god.

5742
04:28:53,520 --> 04:28:54,660
Watch out though.

5743
04:28:54,840 --> 04:28:55,040
I will.

5744
04:28:56,460 --> 04:28:57,140
I'm gonna...

5745
04:28:57,140 --> 04:28:58,680
I'm gonna look for an ult soon.

5746
04:28:58,860 --> 04:28:59,680
I have ult here.

5747
04:29:00,480 --> 04:29:02,440
We have Moon Knight, a brutal combo.

5748
04:29:02,440 --> 04:29:05,260
We got Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

5749
04:29:05,300 --> 04:29:06,480
I have my ult just...

5750
04:29:08,680 --> 04:29:10,720
What the fuck is going on?

5751
04:29:10,800 --> 04:29:12,240
I don't know what's going on.

5752
04:29:13,740 --> 04:29:14,660
Cloak is asleep.

5753
04:29:15,600 --> 04:29:17,080
Cloak is asleep behind me.

5754
04:29:17,560 --> 04:29:18,000
I know, I know.

5755
04:29:21,000 --> 04:29:22,440
I can't heal you guys.

5756
04:29:22,480 --> 04:29:23,240
Oh, that's a big ult.

5757
04:29:26,260 --> 04:29:27,940
Right side cloak, right side cloak.

5758
04:29:28,220 --> 04:29:28,860
Behind us.

5759
04:29:32,780 --> 04:29:33,560
We need, we need.

5760
04:29:34,280 --> 04:29:35,020
I'm gonna get my Mid Knight.

5761
04:29:35,160 --> 04:29:36,740
Magneo one, Magneo one, Magneo one.

5762
04:29:36,820 --> 04:29:37,480
Push him, push him.

5763
04:29:37,780 --> 04:29:38,300
Before he heals.

5764
04:29:41,880 --> 04:29:42,680
Jesus Christ.

5765
04:29:42,980 --> 04:29:45,720
They have Starlord ult here, but I don't have ult.

5766
04:29:49,320 --> 04:29:51,820
We can activate this wall when they come.

5767
04:29:53,220 --> 04:29:54,380
Alright, they're gonna go left side.

5768
04:29:54,800 --> 04:29:55,980
Yeah, they have Starlord ult.

5769
04:29:57,340 --> 04:29:58,300
I'm backing a little bit.

5770
04:29:59,680 --> 04:30:00,080
Nice.

5771
04:30:02,440 --> 04:30:04,140
Focus on the battle.

5772
04:30:05,420 --> 04:30:07,100
Can we win this fight quick?

5773
04:30:09,440 --> 04:30:10,540
I believe in you, bro.

5774
04:30:12,520 --> 04:30:13,340
That's it, that's it.

5775
04:30:13,420 --> 04:30:14,240
That's it, that's it, that's it.

5776
04:30:14,860 --> 04:30:16,560
No, nothing else.

5777
04:30:19,500 --> 04:30:21,620
Thank you for your sacrifice, Guru.

5778
04:30:26,760 --> 04:30:28,020
I'm gonna look for a kidnap again.

5779
04:30:28,320 --> 04:30:31,100
I'm 80, so I might be able to get it.

5780
04:30:32,460 --> 04:30:33,720
I think I did.

5781
04:30:33,780 --> 04:30:36,300
I didn't.

5782
04:30:36,920 --> 04:30:39,880
Yeah, they're definitely gonna Starlord ult here.

5783
04:30:43,900 --> 04:30:45,240
90%, I'm 90%.

5784
04:30:47,840 --> 04:30:49,760
99, I have it, I have it, I have it.

5785
04:30:52,580 --> 04:30:56,020
I slept Bucky, I slept Bucky.

5786
04:30:58,820 --> 04:30:59,820
They have Bored again.

5787
04:31:02,460 --> 04:31:04,360
Starlord behind, Starlord behind, Starlord behind us.

5788
04:31:09,800 --> 04:31:10,960
Okay, just push point.

5789
04:31:11,160 --> 04:31:12,320
Yeah, we can have three on cart.

5790
04:31:22,170 --> 04:31:26,390
I can't believe we...

5791
04:31:28,970 --> 04:31:30,970
If you're GM1, can you play with D1?

5792
04:31:31,030 --> 04:31:31,590
Yeah, you can.

5793
04:31:32,410 --> 04:31:34,970
It's basically like one whole tier.

5794
04:31:35,070 --> 04:31:36,230
I'm sorry, Mac.

5795
04:31:36,470 --> 04:31:37,570
I'm sorry.

5796
04:31:38,790 --> 04:31:40,330
I need this more.

5797
04:31:42,870 --> 04:31:44,470
Mac, I can't function.

5798
04:31:45,630 --> 04:31:48,170
To be fair, he might need this more because he actually has to scrim.

5799
04:31:48,710 --> 04:31:52,230
He has to like scrim next, I think like this week, next week.

5800
04:31:52,510 --> 04:31:54,190
Starting, starting like tomorrow.

5801
04:31:55,110 --> 04:31:59,250
I heard like a lot of Apex players are getting yelled at right now.

5802
04:31:59,250 --> 04:32:08,010
For not playing, for not practicing Apex and playing, never been playing rival rivals.

5803
04:32:08,250 --> 04:32:16,210
I heard in the Apex pro community, a lot of Apex players are getting fucking yelled at right now for just playing rivals.

5804
04:32:16,570 --> 04:32:23,590
They're like, you have to, we have to practice, that is in the early end of the month.

5805
04:32:23,590 --> 04:32:23,870
I can't,

5806
04:32:27,270 --> 04:32:31,620
so Mac really needs this because he has to go back to the Apex waiting hours.

5807
04:32:32,950 --> 04:32:36,050
Rival rivals sabotaging LCS.

5808
04:32:41,250 --> 04:32:43,050
Not their fault.

5809
04:32:47,290 --> 04:32:48,810
That was strange.

5810
04:32:50,370 --> 04:32:50,590
Alright.

5811
04:32:51,310 --> 04:32:52,990
I'm scouting with my DPS, actually.

5812
04:32:54,490 --> 04:32:57,390
We have to TP, just put it on them and we just beam them with Moonknight, no?

5813
04:32:58,370 --> 04:32:59,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I believe.

5814
04:32:59,990 --> 04:33:01,090
I believe in the strange word of...

5815
04:33:03,210 --> 04:33:04,170
They're pushing up.

5816
04:33:16,990 --> 04:33:18,350
I believe in you, Moonknight.

5817
04:33:23,590 --> 04:33:24,730
Oh, strange, huh?

5818
04:33:27,710 --> 04:33:28,350
You're fine.

5819
04:33:31,870 --> 04:33:35,050
Oh, Magnio, Magnio one, Magnio!

5820
04:33:37,430 --> 04:33:38,590
We're damage boosted.

5821
04:33:47,550 --> 04:33:49,010
I'm damage boosting you.

5822
04:33:54,070 --> 04:33:54,630
Oh, nice.

5823
04:33:55,770 --> 04:33:57,010
You're fine, you're so safe.

5824
04:33:59,690 --> 04:34:00,650
Someone help her through it.

5825
04:34:06,450 --> 04:34:08,630
I'm fine now, we can look for a blocker a little bit.

5826
04:34:18,850 --> 04:34:19,930
Mantis, Mantis one, Mantis one.

5827
04:34:21,690 --> 04:34:22,770
I slept her, I slept her, I slept her.

5828
04:34:25,030 --> 04:34:26,110
He's like 1 HP.

5829
04:34:29,870 --> 04:34:30,450
Nice, Urpin.

5830
04:34:30,830 --> 04:34:31,430
I'm going first.

5831
04:34:33,310 --> 04:34:34,130
He has no Cocoon.

5832
04:34:35,310 --> 04:34:37,410
We have Grut and Moonknight, which is probably a combo.

5833
04:34:38,530 --> 04:34:39,570
Yeah, they have Strangel here.

5834
04:34:39,650 --> 04:34:41,090
It's a crazy combo, actually.

5835
04:34:41,430 --> 04:34:43,730
I mean, they don't have Strangel though, because I'm going to block it.

5836
04:34:44,010 --> 04:34:44,770
Oh, yeah, that's true.

5837
04:34:45,050 --> 04:34:46,110
Alright, then I won't ult, right?

5838
04:34:46,130 --> 04:34:46,710
When they Strangel.

5839
04:34:47,790 --> 04:34:48,150
Yeah.

5840
04:34:48,530 --> 04:34:49,430
Okay, I've saved it.

5841
04:34:49,930 --> 04:34:50,070
Alright.

5842
04:34:50,410 --> 04:34:51,370
Magnio, Magnio, Magnio, Magnio!

5843
04:34:51,550 --> 04:34:52,310
Magnio, Magnio, Magnio!

5844
04:34:53,590 --> 04:34:54,510
Okay, I have to ult this.

5845
04:34:56,570 --> 04:34:57,530
That's a huge ult!

5846
04:34:59,870 --> 04:35:01,790
Starlord, Starlord, Starlord!

5847
04:35:03,610 --> 04:35:04,690
Wait, he's floating.

5848
04:35:04,930 --> 04:35:05,470
He's Cocooning.

5849
04:35:08,010 --> 04:35:09,510
Starlord is Cocooning.

5850
04:35:21,380 --> 04:35:22,920
He still has Strangel.

5851
04:35:26,240 --> 04:35:27,640
He should have Magneto too.

5852
04:35:39,420 --> 04:35:41,960
I'm not dead, but I'm running.

5853
04:35:44,960 --> 04:35:47,200
Oh, he's so done.

5854
04:35:47,520 --> 04:35:47,960
He jumped.

5855
04:35:47,980 --> 04:35:48,560
No ult, Starlord.

5856
04:35:50,140 --> 04:35:51,160
They might have the rest though.

5857
04:35:51,380 --> 04:35:52,900
I think they have the rest except Magneto.

5858
04:35:53,900 --> 04:35:55,720
How dare you?

5859
04:35:55,860 --> 04:35:56,600
He jumped!

5860
04:35:56,820 --> 04:35:57,860
That's illegal!

5861
04:35:59,520 --> 04:36:03,140
How dare you fucking jump!

5862
04:36:07,900 --> 04:36:09,440
They should have a Gen here.

5863
04:36:16,120 --> 04:36:18,980
Oh my god.

5864
04:36:24,460 --> 04:36:24,900
Go!

5865
04:36:25,500 --> 04:36:26,380
Booster, go!

5866
04:36:28,780 --> 04:36:31,160
There's a guy right here to my left.

5867
04:36:34,760 --> 04:36:35,640
Or again.

5868
04:36:37,500 --> 04:36:39,660
He's so low, but the item is low.

5869
04:36:50,680 --> 04:36:52,180
I'm so low, I'm so low though.

5870
04:36:52,900 --> 04:36:53,820
Behind, behind Starlord.

5871
04:36:56,500 --> 04:36:58,320
He's on my way, he's on my way.

5872
04:36:58,800 --> 04:36:59,440
I think he's low.

5873
04:37:02,780 --> 04:37:06,500
I think we gotta regroup though.

5874
04:37:07,660 --> 04:37:09,480
Yeah, I'm fighting.

5875
04:37:10,100 --> 04:37:12,440
I believe in you DokiBirdFan69.

5876
04:37:14,640 --> 04:37:15,720
DokiBirdFan69, my ghost.

5877
04:37:16,180 --> 04:37:18,260
Oh, they saw you, they saw you!

5878
04:37:20,120 --> 04:37:20,560
Goodbye.

5879
04:37:20,960 --> 04:37:23,260
I guess I didn't believe hard enough.

5880
04:37:27,500 --> 04:37:29,060
Oh, we're locked out, we're locked out.

5881
04:37:29,880 --> 04:37:30,480
We're locked out.

5882
04:37:30,860 --> 04:37:32,080
I'm locked in, I know about you.

5883
04:37:36,600 --> 04:37:37,540
They're on silo.

5884
04:37:37,540 --> 04:37:37,980
I'm so close.

5885
04:37:47,280 --> 04:37:48,380
Any second now.

5886
04:37:48,520 --> 04:37:50,640
Guys, scan, scan, scan, scan, scan, scan, scan, scan, scan.

5887
04:37:52,320 --> 04:37:53,500
I'm not looking, scan, scan, scan, go.

5888
04:37:55,300 --> 04:37:56,000
Nice, nice, nice.

5889
04:37:57,360 --> 04:37:58,960
There's a Starlord top right?

5890
04:38:02,480 --> 04:38:03,000
Nice peek.

5891
04:38:03,780 --> 04:38:04,540
I'm looking, I'm looking.

5892
04:38:04,680 --> 04:38:05,860
I'm down on this key, by the way.

5893
04:38:05,860 --> 04:38:08,320
He's floating, he's cocooning above us.

5894
04:38:10,540 --> 04:38:13,360
He's right here, he's spawning and cocooning.

5895
04:38:18,720 --> 04:38:21,400
Guys, look at this, look at this.

5896
04:38:21,700 --> 04:38:22,560
I'm looking, I'm looking.

5897
04:38:22,900 --> 04:38:23,360
Got him.

5898
04:38:23,800 --> 04:38:25,400
Nice, nice, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push.

5899
04:38:28,840 --> 04:38:29,200
Woah!

5900
04:38:30,120 --> 04:38:31,420
Nice, nice, nice, no brawls, no brawls.

5901
04:38:31,420 --> 04:38:34,380
I'm on the other one, I'm on the other one, I'm on the other one.

5902
04:38:38,560 --> 04:38:39,680
He's so low, you can stag him.

5903
04:38:41,240 --> 04:38:42,480
Mantis to your right, Mantis to your right.

5904
04:38:46,560 --> 04:38:48,620
Yeah, we gotta walk back, they're pushing out, they're pushing out now.

5905
04:38:48,760 --> 04:38:50,900
Aura, Aura, Aura, Aura.

5906
04:38:51,240 --> 04:38:51,800
Good luck, bro.

5907
04:38:52,460 --> 04:38:53,660
Aura, Aura, I'm telling you.

5908
04:38:53,960 --> 04:38:55,000
They're chasing me, it's fine.

5909
04:38:55,420 --> 04:38:55,700
Okay.

5910
04:38:56,700 --> 04:38:57,520
Are you sure?

5911
04:38:57,680 --> 04:38:58,900
He's getting time, he's getting time.

5912
04:38:59,080 --> 04:38:59,660
Are you sure?

5913
04:38:59,740 --> 04:39:00,380
She's still chasing me.

5914
04:39:01,600 --> 04:39:02,450
I ulted it.

5915
04:39:03,540 --> 04:39:05,380
But they're gonna start their ult after this.

5916
04:39:06,340 --> 04:39:07,020
They're starting their ult.

5917
04:39:07,160 --> 04:39:08,300
I'm TPing to you guys, don't worry about it.

5918
04:39:10,600 --> 04:39:11,240
Okay, okay, okay.

5919
04:39:11,580 --> 04:39:13,100
Wait, give me a second guys, I'm coming back.

5920
04:39:14,080 --> 04:39:14,760
Okay, okay.

5921
04:39:15,880 --> 04:39:17,200
I need some heals, I need some heals.

5922
04:39:18,020 --> 04:39:19,320
I'm trying, I'm trying!

5923
04:39:20,280 --> 04:39:21,500
No, I'm on you all!

5924
04:39:23,360 --> 04:39:23,700
No!

5925
04:39:26,360 --> 04:39:27,540
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

5926
04:39:28,620 --> 04:39:29,740
Oh, we're down.

5927
04:39:31,660 --> 04:39:32,760
We're down one.

5928
04:39:38,260 --> 04:39:38,960
Don't worry.

5929
04:39:40,400 --> 04:39:41,740
They're chasing me, they're chasing me.

5930
04:39:41,900 --> 04:39:43,420
I'm coming back as Jeff.

5931
04:39:45,320 --> 04:39:47,860
Oh, okay, I'll stay Jeff.

5932
04:39:48,080 --> 04:39:50,000
We have root and moonite again.

5933
04:39:53,140 --> 04:39:54,440
Oh, wait, wait, I got picked, I got picked!

5934
04:39:54,640 --> 04:39:55,020
Nice, nice, nice.

5935
04:39:56,120 --> 04:39:58,400
I'm getting, alright, I'm getting on you, Groot.

5936
04:40:03,040 --> 04:40:03,900
We're living!

5937
04:40:05,040 --> 04:40:05,800
We're living!

5938
04:40:06,080 --> 04:40:07,200
Okay, we're not living.

5939
04:40:19,580 --> 04:40:22,420
It's alright, we tried Groot, we tried.

5940
04:40:26,740 --> 04:40:28,840
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

5941
04:40:31,940 --> 04:40:33,540
I damage boosted you.

5942
04:40:41,540 --> 04:40:43,240
Goodbye, Cloak, I'm sorry.

5943
04:40:45,740 --> 04:40:47,320
Yeah, I think we got regrouped here.

5944
04:40:48,840 --> 04:40:50,140
I'm backing up slowly.

5945
04:40:50,720 --> 04:40:52,160
I don't have more leaves, I'm sorry.

5946
04:40:52,860 --> 04:40:54,000
You might get staggered.

5947
04:40:54,000 --> 04:40:54,920
I mean, they're...

5948
04:40:55,780 --> 04:40:56,780
Bordination, Bordination is dead.

5949
04:40:58,060 --> 04:40:59,260
I have ult here, I have ult.

5950
04:40:59,500 --> 04:41:00,500
Leave, leave, leave.

5951
04:41:00,620 --> 04:41:02,040
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

5952
04:41:03,000 --> 04:41:04,180
I have ult, I'm coming in, I'm coming in.

5953
04:41:04,580 --> 04:41:05,640
I'm ulting this for Groot.

5954
04:41:09,160 --> 04:41:10,640
Lucas, train, train, train, train, train, train, train.

5955
04:41:10,660 --> 04:41:11,460
I'm on stream, I'm on stream.

5956
04:41:11,760 --> 04:41:12,840
Oh, he ulted too, he ulted too.

5957
04:41:13,380 --> 04:41:14,680
Our Groot's like, low though.

5958
04:41:20,240 --> 04:41:21,840
I take the point, I take the point.

5959
04:41:22,600 --> 04:41:23,940
We actually almost have...

5960
04:41:25,020 --> 04:41:28,280
We have cloak up, but I don't know if we can make it.

5961
04:41:30,080 --> 04:41:32,180
We can, I think Venom can maybe.

5962
04:41:32,820 --> 04:41:33,120
Nah.

5963
04:41:34,820 --> 04:41:36,000
Okay, that's fine.

5964
04:41:42,860 --> 04:41:43,420
Legendary.

5965
04:41:47,210 --> 04:41:48,650
No, we trolled a little bit.

5966
04:41:53,910 --> 04:41:55,650
Groot fucking explodes.

5967
04:41:55,730 --> 04:41:57,090
I don't know what to do with our Groot.

5968
04:41:57,250 --> 04:41:58,370
I have to...

5969
04:42:00,270 --> 04:42:04,150
I don't know what to do with our Groot.

5970
04:42:04,550 --> 04:42:06,350
Our Groot is like...

5971
04:42:06,350 --> 04:42:08,230
He takes so much damage.

5972
04:42:09,970 --> 04:42:10,990
He fucking...

5973
04:42:10,990 --> 04:42:15,850
I use all my Lee's on the Groot because he explodes so fucking hard.

5974
04:42:16,870 --> 04:42:18,350
Those darn fucking trees.

5975
04:42:18,850 --> 04:42:19,890
I hate trees.

5976
04:42:20,770 --> 04:42:22,830
In game, in game.

5977
04:42:23,390 --> 04:42:24,950
He eats up everything.

5978
04:42:25,090 --> 04:42:27,670
I'm trying to save his life, but he's just like...

5979
04:42:27,670 --> 04:42:29,950
What if I just fucking get chopped down?

5980
04:42:31,290 --> 04:42:32,090
We can do the same thing.

5981
04:42:34,690 --> 04:42:35,590
Yeah, we'll do it.

5982
04:42:36,710 --> 04:42:39,830
If I wasn't Jep, our Groot would have died even faster, y'all.

5983
04:42:39,890 --> 04:42:40,690
That's all I'm saying.

5984
04:42:43,470 --> 04:42:45,930
My heals is regen heals.

5985
04:42:46,090 --> 04:42:47,330
It's not insane.

5986
04:42:48,210 --> 04:42:50,590
Guys, can you all shoot through the TP?

5987
04:42:50,950 --> 04:42:52,370
I'm gonna place it like...

5988
04:42:53,150 --> 04:42:53,950
Above them.

5989
04:42:57,230 --> 04:42:59,590
Make them a little bit unsuspecting.

5990
04:43:00,770 --> 04:43:02,670
I'm scouting their spawn.

5991
04:43:06,130 --> 04:43:06,950
Okay, get ready guys.

5992
04:43:07,390 --> 04:43:08,010
Give me a second.

5993
04:43:08,410 --> 04:43:08,870
We need a moment.

5994
04:43:09,230 --> 04:43:10,650
Yeah, if I was Loki, but we need magic.

5995
04:43:12,170 --> 04:43:14,070
Oh, they're going the other way.

5996
04:43:14,290 --> 04:43:14,650
Inside.

5997
04:43:17,790 --> 04:43:18,470
They're here now.

5998
04:43:23,050 --> 04:43:24,190
More power for you.

5999
04:43:25,430 --> 04:43:26,010
I'm here to kill them.

6000
04:43:26,470 --> 04:43:27,170
They have no shield.

6001
04:43:29,330 --> 04:43:31,830
I think if we just focus, we'll get to support and stuff.

6002
04:43:32,350 --> 04:43:34,130
And they're kinda in a bad position.

6003
04:43:35,290 --> 04:43:36,330
Try to get Penta.

6004
04:43:36,670 --> 04:43:37,550
Shine, shine, shine.

6005
04:43:37,670 --> 04:43:38,790
Spin one, spin one, spin one.

6006
04:43:39,270 --> 04:43:39,750
No weapon mag.

6007
04:43:40,070 --> 04:43:41,110
Oh, my shield is low, shield is low!

6008
04:43:41,490 --> 04:43:42,010
My god.

6009
04:43:43,190 --> 04:43:43,990
Look at me, look at me.

6010
04:43:44,410 --> 04:43:45,110
I have damage boost to you.

6011
04:43:45,230 --> 04:43:45,810
Mag me.

6012
04:43:45,890 --> 04:43:46,590
Mag one, mag one.

6013
04:43:47,090 --> 04:43:48,290
Starlord, head over.

6014
04:43:48,390 --> 04:43:48,770
Starlord's low.

6015
04:43:50,250 --> 04:43:51,970
Turn around, turn around, turn around.

6016
04:43:52,590 --> 04:43:53,330
Psylocke, Psylocke.

6017
04:43:53,550 --> 04:43:54,390
He's rezzing, he's rezzing.

6018
04:43:58,010 --> 04:43:59,230
Psylocke half, Psylocke's low.

6019
04:44:00,230 --> 04:44:01,370
They TP'd, they TP'd.

6020
04:44:03,270 --> 04:44:04,750
I don't have enough heals for this.

6021
04:44:05,170 --> 04:44:06,270
Look at my, look at my, look at my one.

6022
04:44:07,550 --> 04:44:09,010
I have Starlord on me, he's half.

6023
04:44:10,530 --> 04:44:12,190
It's fine, we play for next, I think.

6024
04:44:13,390 --> 04:44:14,870
There was just too many people.

6025
04:44:17,510 --> 04:44:18,230
They have no TP.

6026
04:44:18,770 --> 04:44:19,530
It's time to shine.

6027
04:44:23,670 --> 04:44:25,070
So much going on.

6028
04:44:25,190 --> 04:44:28,210
You had to heal, and then I had to shoot, and then I had to heal.

6029
04:44:32,190 --> 04:44:33,250
Psylocke to my right.

6030
04:44:33,650 --> 04:44:34,890
They're gonna get Psylocke ult soon.

6031
04:44:38,510 --> 04:44:40,010
There's a, there's a Starlord on her.

6032
04:44:41,310 --> 04:44:42,030
I'm dead.

6033
04:44:42,310 --> 04:44:43,770
I got, I got Starlord, I got Starlord, I got Starlord.

6034
04:44:44,030 --> 04:44:44,790
Starlord one, Starlord two.

6035
04:44:45,050 --> 04:44:46,050
You only have cloak heals.

6036
04:44:46,490 --> 04:44:48,190
We traded, but we have only cloak heals.

6037
04:44:48,790 --> 04:44:49,910
If you have your ult, maybe.

6038
04:44:50,990 --> 04:44:51,550
Oh, nevermind.

6039
04:44:52,530 --> 04:44:54,110
Yeah, we should reset, maybe.

6040
04:44:59,090 --> 04:45:00,030
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

6041
04:45:00,790 --> 04:45:01,950
I'm coming back soon, I'm coming back soon.

6042
04:45:02,070 --> 04:45:02,670
I take ult, I take ult.

6043
04:45:04,950 --> 04:45:07,830
I have ult, I have ult here.

6044
04:45:11,370 --> 04:45:15,330
Careful, they have Starlord ult here.

6045
04:45:15,510 --> 04:45:16,090
I'm trying to save.

6046
04:45:16,090 --> 04:45:18,090
I hit him.

6047
04:45:18,310 --> 04:45:19,530
Starlord, Starlord, Starlord, Starlord, Starlord.

6048
04:45:19,530 --> 04:45:20,050
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

6049
04:45:20,050 --> 04:45:21,030
I'm back, I'm ulting, I'm ulting this.

6050
04:45:21,630 --> 04:45:22,050
I got both.

6051
04:45:22,270 --> 04:45:22,750
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

6052
04:45:22,790 --> 04:45:22,970
Nice.

6053
04:45:23,930 --> 04:45:24,290
Point.

6054
04:45:25,690 --> 04:45:26,810
Yeah, I don't know why, but...

6055
04:45:27,510 --> 04:45:28,290
We got this.

6056
04:45:28,550 --> 04:45:28,810
4 minutes.

6057
04:45:29,070 --> 04:45:30,010
Yeah, okay.

6058
04:45:30,010 --> 04:45:30,750
Look, I have my 50 kills.

6059
04:45:31,670 --> 04:45:32,750
Maybe we get 60 kills.

6060
04:45:33,030 --> 04:45:34,190
Yeah, if I lock in here.

6061
04:45:34,670 --> 04:45:35,350
I believe.

6062
04:45:36,170 --> 04:45:37,710
60 kills, 60 kills, right?

6063
04:45:38,330 --> 04:45:39,130
You're thinking in your head.

6064
04:45:39,150 --> 04:45:41,230
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

6065
04:45:41,470 --> 04:45:42,290
Why stop at 60?

6066
04:45:42,290 --> 04:45:43,530
What if we do 100 kills?

6067
04:45:43,650 --> 04:45:43,910
Yeah.

6068
04:45:45,370 --> 04:45:46,210
I didn't...

6069
04:45:46,210 --> 04:45:46,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6070
04:45:46,870 --> 04:45:47,270
You're right.

6071
04:45:47,530 --> 04:45:48,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6072
04:45:48,110 --> 04:45:51,150
Like, when we cap it, we should just all leave the point and have...

6073
04:45:51,150 --> 04:45:51,930
Just push up.

6074
04:45:52,850 --> 04:45:55,430
What if we tell him to go AFK so I can farm kills?

6075
04:45:58,230 --> 04:45:59,310
Sounds like the game plan.

6076
04:46:00,510 --> 04:46:01,490
And then we lose.

6077
04:46:03,330 --> 04:46:04,130
Oh, hell nah.

6078
04:46:05,230 --> 04:46:05,750
Okay, listen.

6079
04:46:05,990 --> 04:46:08,710
Would you be willing to lose if I get 100?

6080
04:46:08,710 --> 04:46:08,950
No.

6081
04:46:10,970 --> 04:46:11,390
What?

6082
04:46:11,810 --> 04:46:12,570
No, no, no.

6083
04:46:12,570 --> 04:46:12,830
No.

6084
04:46:13,290 --> 04:46:14,150
That's crazy.

6085
04:46:14,430 --> 04:46:17,190
I would be ready to lose for you to get 100 kills.

6086
04:46:17,250 --> 04:46:19,290
Yeah, but I'm not aiming for 100 kills.

6087
04:46:19,450 --> 04:46:20,910
I'm aiming for top 500.

6088
04:46:21,230 --> 04:46:22,010
Why not?

6089
04:46:22,050 --> 04:46:22,610
Why not, Doki?

6090
04:46:22,830 --> 04:46:23,330
Why not?

6091
04:46:23,430 --> 04:46:25,310
You can get 100 kills whenever you want.

6092
04:46:25,870 --> 04:46:28,670
This is why I am the LeBron James of this game, Doki.

6093
04:46:28,670 --> 04:46:29,790
Okay, chill out, chill out.

6094
04:46:30,010 --> 04:46:31,170
Okay, chill out.

6095
04:46:31,950 --> 04:46:33,470
DokiBirdFan is higher-ranked than you.

6096
04:46:34,950 --> 04:46:35,650
Yeah, that's right.

6097
04:46:35,810 --> 04:46:37,550
DokiBirdFan is abusing Wolverine.

6098
04:46:38,310 --> 04:46:39,930
DokiBirdFan is a LeBron of them, alright?

6099
04:46:41,890 --> 04:46:43,690
DokiBirdFan abusing Wolverine, alright, buddy?

6100
04:46:44,250 --> 04:46:46,410
Don't you abuse Dr. Strange?

6101
04:46:48,270 --> 04:46:49,070
Wolverine abusing.

6102
04:46:51,430 --> 04:46:53,090
Don't forget, securing the victory.

6103
04:46:54,350 --> 04:46:56,690
He pulled a Rek'sai.

6104
04:46:58,610 --> 04:46:59,830
They're placing TP.

6105
04:46:59,930 --> 04:47:01,330
They're placing TP in front of me.

6106
04:47:01,390 --> 04:47:01,710
Get ready.

6107
04:47:01,970 --> 04:47:02,250
Okay.

6108
04:47:02,350 --> 04:47:02,610
Go right side.

6109
04:47:02,750 --> 04:47:03,090
Go right side.

6110
04:47:03,130 --> 04:47:03,490
Go right side.

6111
04:47:03,570 --> 04:47:05,470
Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.

6112
04:47:06,010 --> 04:47:06,730
I'm only 125.

6113
04:47:06,730 --> 04:47:09,610
Yeah, I don't... I can't even see anything.

6114
04:47:14,230 --> 04:47:17,070
I'm like... I'm just holding right click as much as I can.

6115
04:47:20,190 --> 04:47:20,590
Okay.

6116
04:47:21,830 --> 04:47:22,690
I'm trying to.

6117
04:47:22,750 --> 04:47:23,770
I don't have leaves anymore.

6118
04:47:24,470 --> 04:47:26,490
There's a... Oh, there's a Starlord behind us.

6119
04:47:31,050 --> 04:47:32,210
Strange one, Strange one, Strange one!

6120
04:47:33,150 --> 04:47:34,470
Um, I slept the Strange.

6121
04:47:34,550 --> 04:47:35,030
I slept Strange.

6122
04:47:35,930 --> 04:47:37,290
Oh, I saw Lux on me.

6123
04:47:39,010 --> 04:47:39,870
Deathcloak, help me!

6124
04:47:40,650 --> 04:47:41,910
I'm getting Mag, I'm getting Mag, I'm getting Mag.

6125
04:47:42,490 --> 04:47:43,830
I think we got regrouped.

6126
04:47:48,490 --> 04:47:48,870
Yeah.

6127
04:47:51,950 --> 04:47:55,370
I can... I don't know if I should save it for a Starlord.

6128
04:47:57,090 --> 04:47:58,470
We need something for Starlord.

6129
04:47:58,670 --> 04:47:58,990
Yeah.

6130
04:47:59,110 --> 04:47:59,610
We need something.

6131
04:47:59,990 --> 04:48:02,310
I'll save mine for Starlord and we can use Cloak.

6132
04:48:08,250 --> 04:48:08,910
Starlord's here, right?

6133
04:48:12,410 --> 04:48:13,310
You're so low.

6134
04:48:14,170 --> 04:48:15,190
I'm sleeping right now.

6135
04:48:15,230 --> 04:48:15,890
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

6136
04:48:17,070 --> 04:48:17,910
I'm going for it.

6137
04:48:18,630 --> 04:48:19,410
Okay, I'm going to ult.

6138
04:48:20,230 --> 04:48:20,830
You guys see him?

6139
04:48:21,510 --> 04:48:22,510
I'm on Mag, I'm on Mag, I'm on Mag.

6140
04:48:22,550 --> 04:48:23,290
I'm ulting too.

6141
04:48:31,490 --> 04:48:32,090
I am...

6142
04:48:33,350 --> 04:48:34,490
There is a Psylocke!

6143
04:48:34,590 --> 04:48:35,030
Psylocke's asleep!

6144
04:48:35,130 --> 04:48:35,530
Psylocke's asleep!

6145
04:48:37,850 --> 04:48:39,010
Starlord one, Starlord one!

6146
04:48:42,410 --> 04:48:43,730
Psylocke, Psylocke, Psylocke!

6147
04:48:46,930 --> 04:48:48,910
Oh no, this Starlord.

6148
04:48:50,030 --> 04:48:51,270
58 kills, 58 kills!

6149
04:48:51,710 --> 04:48:52,510
They will TP, they will TP, they will TP.

6150
04:48:52,770 --> 04:48:53,290
They won't TP.

6151
04:48:53,610 --> 04:48:55,130
It's really hard to TP here.

6152
04:48:55,730 --> 04:48:57,430
No, it's fine, it's fine, because he's already alright.

6153
04:48:57,930 --> 04:48:58,870
Okay, nice.

6154
04:49:01,350 --> 04:49:01,990
Okay, we got this.

6155
04:49:02,310 --> 04:49:03,210
And the ult charge.

6156
04:49:03,250 --> 04:49:04,850
I think they used Mag and he died instantly.

6157
04:49:05,090 --> 04:49:06,090
They used Starlord, they have Psylocke.

6158
04:49:06,230 --> 04:49:06,930
Yeah, they used Psylocke.

6159
04:49:06,930 --> 04:49:07,690
Oh, they already used Psylocke.

6160
04:49:07,850 --> 04:49:09,370
I killed her out of Psylocke ult.

6161
04:49:10,650 --> 04:49:11,570
Okay, nice, okay, nice.

6162
04:49:13,090 --> 04:49:14,170
They still have Strangels, right?

6163
04:49:15,530 --> 04:49:16,250
Yeah, they have Strangels.

6164
04:49:16,630 --> 04:49:18,410
Careful, crew, I don't have a lot of these.

6165
04:49:19,530 --> 04:49:20,530
Nice, guys, that's big, that's big!

6166
04:49:20,630 --> 04:49:21,410
Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag!

6167
04:49:22,710 --> 04:49:23,390
Wait, what?

6168
04:49:24,550 --> 04:49:25,870
How did she get it again?

6169
04:49:27,010 --> 04:49:27,610
We got Psylocke now.

6170
04:49:29,150 --> 04:49:30,590
I thought I killed her out of ult.

6171
04:49:32,850 --> 04:49:33,610
Ah, it's fine, it's fine.

6172
04:49:34,170 --> 04:49:34,630
Starlord's one.

6173
04:49:35,990 --> 04:49:36,630
Starlord's one.

6174
04:49:36,630 --> 04:49:37,210
It's fine.

6175
04:49:37,390 --> 04:49:39,210
They used C, we have two minutes to push, that's very good.

6176
04:49:40,950 --> 04:49:42,130
Okay, that's weird.

6177
04:49:42,330 --> 04:49:43,750
I legitimately saw her ulting.

6178
04:49:45,030 --> 04:49:46,790
Oh, she got 50% back.

6179
04:49:47,210 --> 04:49:47,650
I thought...

6180
04:49:47,650 --> 04:49:48,450
I didn't realize.

6181
04:49:50,530 --> 04:49:52,010
I didn't realize it was 50%.

6182
04:49:52,010 --> 04:49:53,150
She built it so fast.

6183
04:49:53,650 --> 04:49:54,950
I don't have anything for it.

6184
04:49:55,110 --> 04:49:56,070
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

6185
04:49:56,410 --> 04:49:57,470
Adios, adios, adios, nice.

6186
04:49:58,150 --> 04:49:59,310
I'm asleep, I'm asleep.

6187
04:50:00,430 --> 04:50:01,570
Go, push, push, push, push.

6188
04:50:01,570 --> 04:50:03,650
I am pushing.

6189
04:50:04,110 --> 04:50:05,050
There's a Slardar behind me.

6190
04:50:05,050 --> 04:50:06,650
Get Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag.

6191
04:50:06,650 --> 04:50:07,930
Starlord, Starlord, Starlord got his ult.

6192
04:50:08,150 --> 04:50:08,830
Got it all, nice.

6193
04:50:09,350 --> 04:50:09,870
Now we got this.

6194
04:50:11,990 --> 04:50:12,550
Push, push, push.

6195
04:50:13,670 --> 04:50:14,590
He's rezzing, he's rezzing, he's rezzing.

6196
04:50:14,990 --> 04:50:15,750
That's huge, that's huge.

6197
04:50:17,230 --> 04:50:18,790
Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag.

6198
04:50:18,930 --> 04:50:19,870
They can't, they can't keep them up.

6199
04:50:20,710 --> 04:50:22,430
I'm coming back with ult, if you guys can live.

6200
04:50:24,050 --> 04:50:25,070
Yeah, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

6201
04:50:25,290 --> 04:50:25,570
Nice.

6202
04:50:26,310 --> 04:50:26,650
Keep Psy.

6203
04:50:28,650 --> 04:50:31,650
Oh my god, 69 assists, let's go.

6204
04:50:37,370 --> 04:50:40,650
Bro, Mag was trying so hard.

6205
04:50:41,750 --> 04:50:43,990
I'm sorry, Mag.

6206
04:50:48,550 --> 04:50:50,930
Why was I fighting for it?

6207
04:50:51,270 --> 04:50:53,970
There was nothing more I could do.

6208
04:50:54,930 --> 04:50:57,610
He was doing so good too.

6209
04:51:01,690 --> 04:51:03,250
Oh my god.

6210
04:51:05,330 --> 04:51:08,050
Like it's not, like I'm sorry.

6211
04:51:08,750 --> 04:51:10,170
I'm sorry, buddy.

6212
04:51:10,490 --> 04:51:11,910
I'm so fucking sorry.

6213
04:51:12,270 --> 04:51:13,330
I needed it more.

6214
04:51:16,390 --> 04:51:22,470
Bro, he was actually playing out of his fucking mind there.

6215
04:51:22,630 --> 04:51:23,930
It was actually crazy.

6216
04:51:24,550 --> 04:51:27,630
He was playing out of his fucking mind.

6217
04:51:31,830 --> 04:51:32,910
Poor guy.

6218
04:51:34,350 --> 04:51:35,470
Poor guy.

6219
04:51:35,570 --> 04:51:36,910
Am I getting stream sniped?

6220
04:51:41,790 --> 04:51:44,170
I think I might be.

6221
04:51:45,990 --> 04:51:46,710
Probably.

6222
04:51:47,070 --> 04:51:47,550
Did you see that?

6223
04:51:48,090 --> 04:51:52,290
In team and then they got in queue and I got in queue.

6224
04:52:00,520 --> 04:52:01,500
Missed it.

6225
04:52:06,260 --> 04:52:07,900
That's pretty sus.

6226
04:52:08,120 --> 04:52:09,560
Yeah, that's pretty sus.

6227
04:52:11,200 --> 04:52:12,580
Oh my god, thank god.

6228
04:52:12,820 --> 04:52:14,320
We are back in the land.

6229
04:52:14,620 --> 04:52:15,640
Wait, new names.

6230
04:52:16,600 --> 04:52:18,000
Wait, is this EU?

6231
04:52:18,280 --> 04:52:19,920
Oh my god, my one ping.

6232
04:52:24,740 --> 04:52:25,260
Guys,

6233
04:52:29,560 --> 04:52:31,120
my one ping, guys.

6234
04:52:32,300 --> 04:52:34,600
Good thing I had that one ping, right?

6235
04:52:35,500 --> 04:52:36,000
Good fucking...

6236
04:52:36,000 --> 04:52:38,860
Do we just ban Storm, Hella?

6237
04:52:39,740 --> 04:52:40,640
Yeah, go Hella.

6238
04:52:40,640 --> 04:52:41,460
Orange guy detected.

6239
04:52:41,660 --> 04:52:43,080
Bro, he's literally in my stack.

6240
04:52:43,240 --> 04:52:44,260
That's so fucking bad.

6241
04:52:45,980 --> 04:52:47,660
Also, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

6242
04:52:47,780 --> 04:52:48,620
Thank you.

6243
04:52:49,060 --> 04:52:50,700
One ping is real.

6244
04:52:51,440 --> 04:52:53,620
I get one ping no matter what region I'm in.

6245
04:52:54,060 --> 04:52:56,860
Thank you for gifting five stars.

6246
04:52:57,020 --> 04:52:57,960
Thank you.

6247
04:52:58,500 --> 04:52:59,760
I can't lose, you're right.

6248
04:53:02,160 --> 04:53:03,020
Ban Storm?

6249
04:53:03,480 --> 04:53:05,140
We could let it open and just kill it.

6250
04:53:05,140 --> 04:53:06,360
Okay, well, let's just ban whole guy.

6251
04:53:08,320 --> 04:53:10,760
The one ping to rule them all.

6252
04:53:11,540 --> 04:53:13,780
Man, my fiber internet is so fucking good, guys.

6253
04:53:15,360 --> 04:53:16,320
That's crazy.

6254
04:53:18,040 --> 04:53:20,160
Okay, you go play Luna, I go play Mantiska.

6255
04:53:20,580 --> 04:53:23,280
My fiber internet is fucking crazy.

6256
04:53:24,360 --> 04:53:25,720
Wait, I play Luna?

6257
04:53:26,200 --> 04:53:28,140
Can I not play this map?

6258
04:53:29,220 --> 04:53:29,960
What do I play?

6259
04:53:30,200 --> 04:53:31,700
Actually, we are trapped here.

6260
04:53:32,100 --> 04:53:33,360
Three times in a row.

6261
04:53:33,360 --> 04:53:35,480
We fucking hate that map.

6262
04:53:40,870 --> 04:53:41,990
Guys, no.

6263
04:53:42,350 --> 04:53:43,630
Guys, trust me.

6264
04:53:43,670 --> 04:53:45,750
We're doing one match on EU and see how it goes.

6265
04:53:48,650 --> 04:53:51,350
If it goes poorly, that's my bad.

6266
04:53:51,770 --> 04:53:53,430
I even encouraged it.

6267
04:53:53,890 --> 04:53:55,270
I was like, it'll be fine.

6268
04:53:58,430 --> 04:53:59,150
Okay, guys, let's go.

6269
04:54:00,030 --> 04:54:00,890
It'll be fine.

6270
04:54:01,170 --> 04:54:01,710
One ping.

6271
04:54:01,890 --> 04:54:04,330
Luna, we need passive health, so Panthers.

6272
04:54:04,330 --> 04:54:05,710
What did he say?

6273
04:54:06,190 --> 04:54:06,670
Yes.

6274
04:54:07,310 --> 04:54:08,350
Did you get that?

6275
04:54:08,790 --> 04:54:10,370
Wait, what did he say?

6276
04:54:11,710 --> 04:54:13,270
We need passive heal.

6277
04:54:14,570 --> 04:54:15,210
Nah, nah.

6278
04:54:17,190 --> 04:54:19,070
Guys, I need translation.

6279
04:54:19,730 --> 04:54:22,030
Guys, I haven't played with EU players in so long.

6280
04:54:22,050 --> 04:54:23,570
Guys, translation now.

6281
04:54:24,310 --> 04:54:24,510
We?

6282
04:54:26,630 --> 04:54:29,250
Guys, I need translation, please.

6283
04:54:29,270 --> 04:54:30,030
Place above them.

6284
04:54:30,670 --> 04:54:32,470
If they decide to face me.

6285
04:54:35,390 --> 04:54:36,190
Yes, yeah.

6286
04:54:37,190 --> 04:54:38,910
Guys, translations, please.

6287
04:54:39,910 --> 04:54:40,690
There are no ping.

6288
04:54:41,470 --> 04:54:42,930
Okay, I'm just going to place it above them.

6289
04:54:43,690 --> 04:54:44,410
Just shoot them.

6290
04:54:46,110 --> 04:54:47,090
Who's going to shoot them?

6291
04:54:47,170 --> 04:54:47,370
You?

6292
04:54:47,450 --> 04:54:48,270
I'll shoot it, bro.

6293
04:54:48,470 --> 04:54:48,890
I'll shoot it.

6294
04:54:51,410 --> 04:54:52,610
Our Panther got this, bro.

6295
04:54:57,810 --> 04:54:58,750
I called it.

6296
04:54:58,810 --> 04:54:59,210
I called it.

6297
04:54:59,250 --> 04:54:59,710
Nobody followed.

6298
04:55:00,190 --> 04:55:00,970
I was there.

6299
04:55:01,030 --> 04:55:01,730
I was with you.

6300
04:55:02,530 --> 04:55:03,350
Thanks, Doki bro.

6301
04:55:03,350 --> 04:55:04,690
I know you got my back.

6302
04:55:04,930 --> 04:55:05,630
Behind, behind, behind.

6303
04:55:05,850 --> 04:55:06,510
There's a Psylocke.

6304
04:55:06,590 --> 04:55:07,190
There's a Psylocke behind.

6305
04:55:11,150 --> 04:55:13,650
Jesus, you're taking so much damage.

6306
04:55:14,490 --> 04:55:15,130
There's a Psylocke.

6307
04:55:15,710 --> 04:55:16,510
On our Mantis.

6308
04:55:16,750 --> 04:55:17,990
I can't get to you, Mantis.

6309
04:55:21,170 --> 04:55:21,930
Psylocke's on me now.

6310
04:55:22,430 --> 04:55:22,830
Psylocke's on me.

6311
04:55:25,830 --> 04:55:27,430
I have a Psylocke on me.

6312
04:55:27,430 --> 04:55:28,030
Still.

6313
04:55:31,370 --> 04:55:33,070
Do you know how to play Namor?

6314
04:55:33,530 --> 04:55:35,450
No, I don't play Namor.

6315
04:55:35,610 --> 04:55:35,870
I'm sorry.

6316
04:55:36,710 --> 04:55:39,050
Bro, that's the most American European I've ever met.

6317
04:55:41,270 --> 04:55:42,770
Oh no, you're the legend.

6318
04:55:46,190 --> 04:55:48,330
It sounded so American.

6319
04:55:48,890 --> 04:55:49,870
Oh, Mantis, I can't...

6320
04:55:49,870 --> 04:55:50,110
Hey, fuck it, I'm down.

6321
04:55:50,910 --> 04:55:52,970
Bro, where are you from?

6322
04:55:55,690 --> 04:55:56,430
Make a skinsh.

6323
04:55:57,950 --> 04:56:01,330
Heal me, heal me, heal me.

6324
04:56:01,770 --> 04:56:02,310
I'm one.

6325
04:56:02,810 --> 04:56:04,330
I'm trying to heal you from below.

6326
04:56:07,190 --> 04:56:08,090
I have no ammo.

6327
04:56:08,310 --> 04:56:08,970
Oh my god.

6328
04:56:09,690 --> 04:56:10,650
Push this, push this, push this.

6329
04:56:10,730 --> 04:56:11,430
W, W, W.

6330
04:56:14,270 --> 04:56:14,990
Punisher, Punisher.

6331
04:56:15,230 --> 04:56:15,930
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

6332
04:56:16,190 --> 04:56:16,890
Punisher's by himself?

6333
04:56:18,270 --> 04:56:19,630
We got locked out, we got locked out.

6334
04:56:25,290 --> 04:56:26,530
He's behind us.

6335
04:56:26,530 --> 04:56:27,390
I froze him.

6336
04:56:28,310 --> 04:56:28,710
Nevermind.

6337
04:56:35,090 --> 04:56:36,250
I have my TP.

6338
04:56:36,550 --> 04:56:37,030
I'm at TPS.

6339
04:56:37,030 --> 04:56:39,190
Where is this Black Panther from?

6340
04:56:39,670 --> 04:56:40,410
No, I don't have TP.

6341
04:56:40,510 --> 04:56:41,270
I'm sorry for a second.

6342
04:56:41,770 --> 04:56:43,410
Oh yeah, I can't be CC and all.

6343
04:56:43,510 --> 04:56:44,530
Yeah, I just noticed that.

6344
04:56:44,630 --> 04:56:46,070
I forgot that he was in ult form.

6345
04:56:47,510 --> 04:56:48,610
My mind blanked out there.

6346
04:56:48,730 --> 04:56:49,650
Jesus Christ.

6347
04:56:50,430 --> 04:56:51,630
Oh my god, you're...

6348
04:56:52,590 --> 04:56:53,390
Oh my...

6349
04:56:53,390 --> 04:56:54,790
Oh my god.

6350
04:56:54,790 --> 04:56:55,910
We're locked out.

6351
04:56:57,010 --> 04:56:58,390
Yeah, it's not now but...

6352
04:56:58,390 --> 04:56:59,530
Yeah, I can't do anything here.

6353
04:57:00,010 --> 04:57:00,410
I'm gonna slow.

6354
04:57:01,090 --> 04:57:02,550
I froze stream.

6355
04:57:06,010 --> 04:57:08,430
Oh, that Psylocke wants to kill you.

6356
04:57:08,930 --> 04:57:09,970
They're one, they're one, they're one.

6357
04:57:10,550 --> 04:57:11,070
They're one, they're one, they're one.

6358
04:57:11,070 --> 04:57:11,430
I have to reload.

6359
04:57:14,390 --> 04:57:16,510
But he's still contesting if we can...

6360
04:57:16,510 --> 04:57:17,010
Are we getting suicide?

6361
04:57:17,550 --> 04:57:17,950
Nah.

6362
04:57:18,390 --> 04:57:19,350
We're not gonna go all far.

6363
04:57:21,870 --> 04:57:22,850
Help our Penny.

6364
04:57:23,610 --> 04:57:24,770
I'm trying my best.

6365
04:57:24,790 --> 04:57:26,270
I'm trying my best.

6366
04:57:27,370 --> 04:57:28,090
Don't clap.

6367
04:57:28,870 --> 04:57:30,410
We can Mass Assault first.

6368
04:57:33,370 --> 04:57:34,250
Get out!

6369
04:57:34,350 --> 04:57:35,030
Just walk backwards!

6370
04:57:35,530 --> 04:57:36,870
Oh my god, that's right!

6371
04:57:36,950 --> 04:57:37,810
Walk backwards!

6372
04:57:37,910 --> 04:57:38,390
That's the plan!

6373
04:57:43,550 --> 04:57:46,210
I have a Psylocke behind me though.

6374
04:57:47,090 --> 04:57:47,950
I don't want to ult here.

6375
04:57:48,910 --> 04:57:49,630
I need help, I need help!

6376
04:57:51,990 --> 04:57:52,550
Heal's here.

6377
04:57:56,190 --> 04:57:56,970
Did you kill one?

6378
04:57:59,050 --> 04:58:01,770
I have ult so you can build ult off of our...

6379
04:58:01,770 --> 04:58:03,370
Play here, play here, play here, play here.

6380
04:58:07,680 --> 04:58:08,320
I'm with you.

6381
04:58:09,160 --> 04:58:09,620
I have to reload.

6382
04:58:12,340 --> 04:58:12,860
Strange one.

6383
04:58:12,980 --> 04:58:13,600
Strange one, strange one.

6384
04:58:14,900 --> 04:58:16,420
Psylocke's just poking us.

6385
04:58:16,920 --> 04:58:17,400
Molting us.

6386
04:58:20,600 --> 04:58:21,000
Woah.

6387
04:58:21,900 --> 04:58:22,400
Watch out.

6388
04:58:26,740 --> 04:58:27,720
Oh my god.

6389
04:58:27,820 --> 04:58:29,980
3, 2, 1.

6390
04:58:33,700 --> 04:58:35,280
Oh my god, I'm dead.

6391
04:58:42,480 --> 04:58:45,760
Jesus Christ, the triple support is going crazy over there.

6392
04:58:51,940 --> 04:59:00,080
I am not wasting my potential on support because the DPS players I'm playing against have been playing DPS on Overwatch for fucking years.

6393
04:59:01,040 --> 04:59:03,780
Bro, I cannot compete against that.

6394
04:59:04,100 --> 04:59:07,840
Yeah, I play Apex, but like I play...

6395
04:59:07,840 --> 04:59:09,280
Oh my god.

6396
04:59:12,120 --> 04:59:15,320
I've been playing Overwatch support for years still.

6397
04:59:18,840 --> 04:59:22,160
I'm literally playing against Overwatch League fucking DPS players.

6398
04:59:22,300 --> 04:59:23,780
Like what the fuck am I going to do?

6399
04:59:23,780 --> 04:59:25,980
I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I left.

6400
04:59:26,160 --> 04:59:27,440
He fucked up TP, he fucked up TP.

6401
04:59:28,520 --> 04:59:29,720
Can we touch, can we touch?

6402
04:59:31,340 --> 04:59:32,160
I'm on it, I'm on it.

6403
04:59:42,420 --> 04:59:44,300
Which is why you should learn tech.

6404
04:59:44,520 --> 04:59:46,340
I don't hate myself that much.

6405
04:59:46,340 --> 04:59:47,560
I don't...

6406
04:59:50,060 --> 04:59:55,280
Guys, I don't hate myself that much to play tank.

6407
05:00:03,160 --> 05:00:04,880
I feel attacked.

6408
05:00:13,800 --> 05:00:14,740
Needless.

6409
05:00:22,600 --> 05:00:23,820
Thor is fun as hell.

6410
05:00:23,860 --> 05:00:24,640
Thor is in meta.

6411
05:00:26,200 --> 05:00:28,460
In high elo, it's Magneto, Strange.

6412
05:00:31,940 --> 05:00:32,900
And then...

6413
05:00:32,900 --> 05:00:33,760
I guess nothing.

6414
05:00:34,760 --> 05:00:35,840
Magneto, Strange.

6415
05:00:37,180 --> 05:00:38,780
How many people play other than that?

6416
05:00:39,340 --> 05:00:41,420
That's really... I guess like Root with the Strange.

6417
05:00:41,600 --> 05:00:42,280
Hulk, yeah.

6418
05:00:42,580 --> 05:00:43,800
Magneto, Strange, Hulk.

6419
05:00:44,160 --> 05:00:44,620
I'm sure.

6420
05:00:45,140 --> 05:00:46,160
Do I even TP?

6421
05:00:46,300 --> 05:00:47,880
Every time we TP, we lose.

6422
05:00:48,920 --> 05:00:50,280
Yeah, I think it's pretty good actually.

6423
05:00:51,120 --> 05:00:52,000
That's so true.

6424
05:00:54,320 --> 05:00:56,700
Root is fine, but like...

6425
05:00:56,700 --> 05:00:59,000
It depends, it really depends.

6426
05:00:59,120 --> 05:00:59,960
It's very situational.

6427
05:01:00,240 --> 05:01:01,060
Whoa, one ping?

6428
05:01:01,140 --> 05:01:02,240
That's crazy, I know.

6429
05:01:06,420 --> 05:01:06,740
Whoa.

6430
05:01:08,360 --> 05:01:10,500
I don't see their Strange.

6431
05:01:11,180 --> 05:01:12,240
He's TPing, he's TPing.

6432
05:01:12,280 --> 05:01:12,960
I'm TPing on him.

6433
05:01:13,660 --> 05:01:15,240
Right side, go fast, go fast, go fast.

6434
05:01:15,320 --> 05:01:15,880
On him, on him, on him.

6435
05:01:15,900 --> 05:01:16,820
I'm frozen, I'm frozen, I'm frozen.

6436
05:01:16,820 --> 05:01:17,820
Okay, okay, okay.

6437
05:01:19,200 --> 05:01:19,540
We got one.

6438
05:01:21,580 --> 05:01:22,540
Jesus Christ.

6439
05:01:23,560 --> 05:01:24,400
Jesus Christ.

6440
05:01:26,720 --> 05:01:27,840
The Rocket is by himself.

6441
05:01:30,820 --> 05:01:33,020
Wait, there's a Psylocke in our TP.

6442
05:01:34,840 --> 05:01:35,960
I'm trying to help you.

6443
05:01:36,140 --> 05:01:36,980
Get the supports fast.

6444
05:01:39,280 --> 05:01:40,800
There's a Raccoon to our right.

6445
05:01:42,320 --> 05:01:42,780
We got one.

6446
05:01:44,240 --> 05:01:44,760
Ah, she's out.

6447
05:01:45,080 --> 05:01:45,500
It's fine though.

6448
05:01:45,500 --> 05:01:46,820
Get point, get point.

6449
05:01:47,060 --> 05:01:47,720
Don't die, don't die.

6450
05:01:47,920 --> 05:01:48,400
Oh.

6451
05:01:48,680 --> 05:01:51,360
Just keep getting points.

6452
05:01:51,560 --> 05:01:52,940
Psylocke behind, Psylocke behind.

6453
05:01:53,660 --> 05:01:54,360
Psylocke's on me.

6454
05:01:55,760 --> 05:01:56,740
Psylocke's one, Psylocke's one.

6455
05:01:57,040 --> 05:01:57,540
I got Psylocke.

6456
05:01:59,460 --> 05:02:01,500
I'm on Strange, Strange one, Strange one.

6457
05:02:04,920 --> 05:02:08,080
There we go.

6458
05:02:08,500 --> 05:02:09,700
That's right, heal this!

6459
05:02:11,360 --> 05:02:11,840
Alright.

6460
05:02:12,620 --> 05:02:14,780
Yeah, Mathis, you can push up for ult charge.

6461
05:02:14,920 --> 05:02:15,820
I already have my ult.

6462
05:02:22,080 --> 05:02:25,980
Alright, here we go.

6463
05:02:26,880 --> 05:02:28,240
Yeah, Jeff is quick play meta.

6464
05:02:28,540 --> 05:02:29,740
Unless you're a fucking one trick.

6465
05:02:30,600 --> 05:02:31,500
Then you're scary as hell.

6466
05:02:33,780 --> 05:02:35,700
Then like, I don't know, do whatever the fuck you want.

6467
05:02:43,400 --> 05:02:45,100
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

6468
05:02:47,940 --> 05:02:49,500
There's Strange one, Strange one.

6469
05:02:54,700 --> 05:02:55,260
Psylocke's one.

6470
05:02:55,580 --> 05:02:56,700
Oh, we lost our Mantis.

6471
05:02:56,780 --> 05:02:58,180
I think we should just back off a little.

6472
05:02:59,620 --> 05:03:01,020
I froze the Strange.

6473
05:03:03,000 --> 05:03:04,300
Morenation is dying, guys.

6474
05:03:05,280 --> 05:03:05,700
Goodbye.

6475
05:03:05,980 --> 05:03:06,360
Yeah, it's fine.

6476
05:03:08,240 --> 05:03:10,900
Oh, I might get staggered.

6477
05:03:10,940 --> 05:03:11,360
No!

6478
05:03:12,600 --> 05:03:13,200
It's fine.

6479
05:03:14,340 --> 05:03:16,340
Rocket Raccoon is meta too.

6480
05:03:18,400 --> 05:03:20,080
Oh my god, we've lost him.

6481
05:03:20,840 --> 05:03:21,600
We lost him too.

6482
05:03:21,640 --> 05:03:22,680
He cut off his hands.

6483
05:03:22,960 --> 05:03:24,000
We fucking lost him.

6484
05:03:26,600 --> 05:03:28,480
I'm gonna look for finish off to E5, okay?

6485
05:03:30,560 --> 05:03:31,440
Yeah, there's no shield.

6486
05:03:31,560 --> 05:03:31,980
Strange no shield.

6487
05:03:32,360 --> 05:03:33,700
Jesus Christ.

6488
05:03:35,120 --> 05:03:35,980
E damage on finisher?

6489
05:03:37,100 --> 05:03:37,780
Thanks for the shield.

6490
05:03:38,560 --> 05:03:39,160
Psylocke's half.

6491
05:03:39,280 --> 05:03:39,880
He's looped, he's looped.

6492
05:03:39,920 --> 05:03:40,840
Okay, he's out.

6493
05:03:41,360 --> 05:03:43,800
The king in black shall not see the light again.

6494
05:03:44,560 --> 05:03:45,940
I am ready to put on the show.

6495
05:03:47,420 --> 05:03:48,740
There's a Psylocke behind us.

6496
05:03:49,320 --> 05:03:49,720
Yeah.

6497
05:03:50,140 --> 05:03:50,640
I'm ulting.

6498
05:03:51,840 --> 05:03:52,920
They have Strange ult though.

6499
05:03:54,660 --> 05:03:55,200
That's fine, that's fine.

6500
05:03:58,360 --> 05:03:59,640
He's looking for it, he's looking for it.

6501
05:03:59,680 --> 05:04:00,180
Strange, Strange, Strange.

6502
05:04:00,820 --> 05:04:01,360
Yeah, it's fine.

6503
05:04:04,460 --> 05:04:04,860
Again.

6504
05:04:05,120 --> 05:04:05,960
Strange one, Strange one.

6505
05:04:08,140 --> 05:04:08,920
Psylocke half.

6506
05:04:09,180 --> 05:04:09,860
Oh, he's getting healed.

6507
05:04:12,560 --> 05:04:14,420
Watch out, Psylocke's half, Psylocke's half.

6508
05:04:14,460 --> 05:04:14,980
Oh, no, no, no.

6509
05:04:15,000 --> 05:04:15,860
I did.

6510
05:04:16,060 --> 05:04:17,220
I healed you.

6511
05:04:18,040 --> 05:04:19,880
I healed you, I swear.

6512
05:04:21,420 --> 05:04:22,340
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

6513
05:04:22,380 --> 05:04:23,000
Feed him, bro.

6514
05:04:26,380 --> 05:04:29,040
He did every headshot possible.

6515
05:04:34,500 --> 05:04:36,040
Oh my god.

6516
05:04:38,660 --> 05:04:39,220
Why?

6517
05:04:39,760 --> 05:04:42,620
You saw my fucking thing on him.

6518
05:04:43,140 --> 05:04:44,300
He was headshotting.

6519
05:04:44,380 --> 05:04:44,940
What do I do?

6520
05:04:47,560 --> 05:04:49,500
It was so strong.

6521
05:04:54,240 --> 05:04:55,300
Nothing could...

6522
05:04:55,300 --> 05:04:56,680
I mean, if our Luna also...

6523
05:04:56,680 --> 05:04:57,240
I'm not Luna.

6524
05:04:57,480 --> 05:04:58,760
If our Mantis...

6525
05:04:58,760 --> 05:05:02,640
If our Mantis also healed him, it would have been possible.

6526
05:05:03,060 --> 05:05:06,020
I literally did everything I could to keep him up.

6527
05:05:06,920 --> 05:05:07,720
Psylocke's behind.

6528
05:05:15,480 --> 05:05:17,100
Bro, is our Mantis okay?

6529
05:05:17,660 --> 05:05:19,080
Oh my god.

6530
05:05:19,640 --> 05:05:23,660
If only our Mantis was not having a good time.

6531
05:05:25,720 --> 05:05:26,940
Our Mantis is dead.

6532
05:05:29,360 --> 05:05:30,380
No more nation.

6533
05:05:38,640 --> 05:05:40,800
Our Mantis is not having a good time.

6534
05:05:40,920 --> 05:05:42,120
I just realized that.

6535
05:05:48,360 --> 05:05:49,080
He's dead.

6536
05:05:59,480 --> 05:06:00,180
They're all there.

6537
05:06:02,560 --> 05:06:03,440
Watch out, strangers.

6538
05:06:05,120 --> 05:06:06,200
Watch out, strangers.

6539
05:06:06,420 --> 05:06:07,000
Strangers, strangers.

6540
05:06:08,640 --> 05:06:10,360
Okay, we never land well.

6541
05:06:15,240 --> 05:06:16,320
Jesus Christ.

6542
05:06:17,920 --> 05:06:20,040
There's a Psylocke above high ground.

6543
05:06:21,980 --> 05:06:23,500
I'm trying to make sure.

6544
05:06:26,400 --> 05:06:27,120
Bro.

6545
05:06:30,260 --> 05:06:31,500
Bro, they're all...

6546
05:06:35,540 --> 05:06:36,860
Oh my god.

6547
05:06:37,880 --> 05:06:40,380
There's so much damage being taken.

6548
05:06:42,380 --> 05:06:42,900
No!

6549
05:06:43,340 --> 05:06:44,120
We have one fight left.

6550
05:06:45,720 --> 05:06:47,280
I'm going to have to give this to Psylocke.

6551
05:06:47,860 --> 05:06:48,720
Psylocke one.

6552
05:06:50,760 --> 05:06:51,440
Bro.

6553
05:06:52,480 --> 05:06:54,180
Oh my god, we're going Squirrel.

6554
05:06:54,320 --> 05:06:54,920
That's fine.

6555
05:06:55,740 --> 05:06:56,260
This is it.

6556
05:06:56,460 --> 05:06:57,740
The Squirrel is the pick.

6557
05:06:58,680 --> 05:07:00,180
It's game changing.

6558
05:07:02,040 --> 05:07:03,200
I believe.

6559
05:07:03,560 --> 05:07:05,400
I still believe.

6560
05:07:06,160 --> 05:07:07,100
I still...

6561
05:07:07,100 --> 05:07:11,040
I'm so low.

6562
05:07:17,180 --> 05:07:17,560
Bye.

6563
05:07:22,380 --> 05:07:23,140
Two seconds.

6564
05:07:28,880 --> 05:07:29,920
Oh my god.

6565
05:07:30,040 --> 05:07:30,400
We gotta touch.

6566
05:07:30,440 --> 05:07:30,740
We gotta touch.

6567
05:07:30,840 --> 05:07:31,160
We gotta touch.

6568
05:07:35,560 --> 05:07:37,160
They're going to Psylocke after this.

6569
05:07:42,440 --> 05:07:43,320
I'm a little scared.

6570
05:07:47,580 --> 05:07:48,100
Oh.

6571
05:07:49,440 --> 05:07:51,160
Oh my god.

6572
05:07:51,940 --> 05:07:53,000
I have to reload.

6573
05:07:55,180 --> 05:07:56,340
Just run backwards.

6574
05:07:56,480 --> 05:07:57,340
Just run backwards.

6575
05:07:57,660 --> 05:07:58,900
That's what they say, right?

6576
05:07:59,820 --> 05:08:01,500
Oh, I have Psylocke on me.

6577
05:08:05,850 --> 05:08:07,630
Guys, I don't think this is it.

6578
05:08:07,730 --> 05:08:09,270
This Psylocke fucked us up.

6579
05:08:15,130 --> 05:08:16,450
Oh my god.

6580
05:08:19,230 --> 05:08:22,010
No, this Psylocke farmed this hard.

6581
05:08:22,250 --> 05:08:29,430
Yeah, it's understandable.

6582
05:08:29,970 --> 05:08:31,330
Their Psylocke was just better.

6583
05:08:32,950 --> 05:08:38,090
Raccoon was only viable because there were two other supports, guys.

6584
05:08:38,550 --> 05:08:39,890
They ran triple support.

6585
05:08:40,630 --> 05:08:42,610
You can't fucking say Raccoon carried.

6586
05:08:42,770 --> 05:08:43,810
They ran triple support.

6587
05:08:44,470 --> 05:08:46,690
He was like in plus one.

6588
05:08:51,710 --> 05:08:53,150
Just hit your freeze.

6589
05:08:53,710 --> 05:08:55,570
I have a Mantis with me.

6590
05:08:55,670 --> 05:08:57,970
Why don't you tell her to hit her fucking sleep tail?

6591
05:08:58,390 --> 05:08:59,810
Why is it just me?

6592
05:09:03,290 --> 05:09:05,870
The Raccoon was near the third wheel.

6593
05:09:09,330 --> 05:09:11,930
What about her Mantis?

6594
05:09:12,170 --> 05:09:13,570
She was also struggling.

6595
05:09:19,050 --> 05:09:22,790
He was near the third wheeling fucking Peter Hal.

6596
05:09:25,270 --> 05:09:27,170
Why is it with noise?

6597
05:09:27,470 --> 05:09:28,690
Oh, it's you, is it?

6598
05:09:29,250 --> 05:09:31,490
Yes, absolutely.

6599
05:09:32,010 --> 05:09:33,130
I'm glad people noticed.

6600
05:09:38,850 --> 05:09:41,390
I'm glad people noticed, guys.

6601
05:09:41,770 --> 05:09:42,370
Thank you.

6602
05:09:43,970 --> 05:09:45,590
We get that map a fourth time.

6603
05:09:45,670 --> 05:09:46,530
I'm going to...

6604
05:09:46,530 --> 05:09:47,190
That's true.

6605
05:09:47,350 --> 05:09:48,530
That was like the fourth time.

6606
05:09:48,570 --> 05:09:50,690
We played that map for four times.

6607
05:09:50,770 --> 05:09:51,410
Oh, finally.

6608
05:09:51,410 --> 05:09:53,150
We're in Shibuya.

6609
05:10:00,310 --> 05:10:02,050
We're in Shibuya now.

6610
05:10:08,990 --> 05:10:11,830
We're not fucking playing the Raccoon.

6611
05:10:11,830 --> 05:10:12,730
I'm Luna Snow.

6612
05:10:13,270 --> 05:10:15,830
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

6613
05:10:17,690 --> 05:10:18,930
Oh, we're still in EU.

6614
05:10:19,490 --> 05:10:20,270
With my one ping.

6615
05:10:24,790 --> 05:10:26,530
But I want to play Halo, bro.

6616
05:10:26,910 --> 05:10:27,650
I want to play Halo.

6617
05:10:28,850 --> 05:10:30,310
Yo, that's too bad, I guess.

6618
05:10:33,730 --> 05:10:34,190
Guys!

6619
05:10:35,470 --> 05:10:36,650
How long have I been streaming for you?

6620
05:10:37,290 --> 05:10:38,970
I've been five hours.

6621
05:10:40,030 --> 05:10:41,910
Right click, left click.

6622
05:10:43,770 --> 05:10:44,890
It's okay.

6623
05:10:49,770 --> 05:10:51,030
It's okay.

6624
05:10:52,970 --> 05:10:54,270
I'm okay.

6625
05:10:58,700 --> 05:10:59,400
We're better Hawkeye?

6626
05:10:59,500 --> 05:11:00,500
Yeah, we're better Hawkeye.

6627
05:11:01,260 --> 05:11:02,900
No, you do not.

6628
05:11:05,000 --> 05:11:06,760
It'll be fine, guys.

6629
05:11:08,380 --> 05:11:11,540
It's how nobody says they're not a fan of Doki.

6630
05:11:11,880 --> 05:11:13,800
How they are a fan.

6631
05:11:18,420 --> 05:11:22,580
Wait, we didn't even ban Mantis.

6632
05:11:27,960 --> 05:11:28,920
I'm bored!

6633
05:11:36,760 --> 05:11:39,900
I'll drop follow on Doki, you guys!

6634
05:11:41,540 --> 05:11:42,760
It's working!

6635
05:11:43,520 --> 05:11:44,880
It's fucking working!

6636
05:11:47,740 --> 05:11:48,740
He's a paid actor.

6637
05:11:49,960 --> 05:11:51,740
Weakest Doki breed.

6638
05:11:52,020 --> 05:11:52,920
Plus one.

6639
05:11:53,960 --> 05:11:55,220
Plus one.

6640
05:11:56,380 --> 05:11:58,940
The grind never... It's just that easy.

6641
05:11:59,320 --> 05:12:00,880
It's literally just that easy.

6642
05:12:01,180 --> 05:12:03,480
Marketing goes insane.

6643
05:12:04,140 --> 05:12:05,620
Why don't we have a Mantis?

6644
05:12:06,820 --> 05:12:08,300
That doesn't matter, bro.

6645
05:12:08,340 --> 05:12:08,780
That doesn't matter.

6646
05:12:10,300 --> 05:12:11,500
Gain plus one.

6647
05:12:11,700 --> 05:12:12,960
Now will they throw for you?

6648
05:12:13,240 --> 05:12:14,340
Doki, that's true.

6649
05:12:14,660 --> 05:12:15,260
That's true.

6650
05:12:15,920 --> 05:12:16,960
He dropped the follow.

6651
05:12:17,160 --> 05:12:17,680
It's time.

6652
05:12:18,160 --> 05:12:19,520
Free me from this cage.

6653
05:12:20,580 --> 05:12:23,780
The moment I get 200 points, I'm fucking ending it for today.

6654
05:12:23,980 --> 05:12:25,420
I can't keep going.

6655
05:12:28,040 --> 05:12:29,880
I'm not strong enough.

6656
05:12:30,140 --> 05:12:30,780
I'm sorry.

6657
05:12:32,880 --> 05:12:34,100
Wait, can you play Luna?

6658
05:12:34,320 --> 05:12:35,800
I can play Mantis.

6659
05:12:38,380 --> 05:12:39,500
Okay, they have Luna.

6660
05:12:39,860 --> 05:12:40,560
Okay, okay.

6661
05:12:42,220 --> 05:12:43,780
If we die, we'll swap.

6662
05:12:46,340 --> 05:12:47,480
Wait, Black Panther!

6663
05:12:47,600 --> 05:12:47,720
Black Panther!

6664
05:12:48,100 --> 05:12:49,740
Okay, now we swap.

6665
05:12:53,380 --> 05:12:54,640
We did it.

6666
05:12:55,040 --> 05:12:55,880
It was planned.

6667
05:12:56,120 --> 05:12:57,060
Okay, they have to keep on diving.

6668
05:12:57,660 --> 05:12:59,180
Alright, nice.

6669
05:12:59,660 --> 05:13:01,460
What if I go panic?

6670
05:13:02,040 --> 05:13:03,180
We did it.

6671
05:13:03,900 --> 05:13:05,100
We did it.

6672
05:13:05,100 --> 05:13:06,820
Rio, Rio, Rio.

6673
05:13:06,840 --> 05:13:10,040
Rio, Rio, Rio.

6674
05:13:10,040 --> 05:13:13,520
I believe anybody can do it.

6675
05:13:13,660 --> 05:13:14,060
It's you.

6676
05:13:15,300 --> 05:13:15,840
Thank you.

6677
05:13:16,140 --> 05:13:16,780
Thank you, though.

6678
05:13:17,280 --> 05:13:18,300
Oh shit, nice, nice, nice!

6679
05:13:18,300 --> 05:13:18,700
Magic, magic!

6680
05:13:22,220 --> 05:13:23,840
Careful for Black Panther, though.

6681
05:13:26,080 --> 05:13:27,460
Wait, the supports are low.

6682
05:13:29,260 --> 05:13:30,180
Black Panther on me.

6683
05:13:31,640 --> 05:13:32,600
I'm looking for one.

6684
05:13:34,120 --> 05:13:34,740
We're down.

6685
05:13:34,860 --> 05:13:35,580
We're down support.

6686
05:13:41,060 --> 05:13:41,780
They're still...

6687
05:13:42,620 --> 05:13:44,180
They only have Luna heals.

6688
05:13:45,500 --> 05:13:46,420
Yeah, we have Luna heals.

6689
05:13:47,540 --> 05:13:48,100
I think we should play.

6690
05:13:51,360 --> 05:13:52,120
There's a Magic.

6691
05:13:53,060 --> 05:13:53,720
Magic, sleep.

6692
05:13:53,820 --> 05:13:54,260
Magic, sleep.

6693
05:13:56,020 --> 05:13:56,820
Right, right, right.

6694
05:14:02,840 --> 05:14:03,280
Woah.

6695
05:14:03,880 --> 05:14:05,400
I'm just gonna stay here.

6696
05:14:17,720 --> 05:14:20,080
I'm a little scared about that Black Panther.

6697
05:14:22,720 --> 05:14:23,540
Black Panther on me.

6698
05:14:24,000 --> 05:14:24,520
He's on me.

6699
05:14:24,560 --> 05:14:25,060
I need heals.

6700
05:14:28,580 --> 05:14:29,640
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

6701
05:14:29,640 --> 05:14:31,000
I'm ulting.

6702
05:14:31,160 --> 05:14:31,780
Oh wait, nevermind.

6703
05:14:33,440 --> 05:14:34,080
I'll ult after.

6704
05:14:42,160 --> 05:14:43,320
I'm ulting.

6705
05:14:43,420 --> 05:14:43,680
I'm ulting.

6706
05:14:48,160 --> 05:14:48,980
Magic's asleep.

6707
05:14:49,140 --> 05:14:49,720
Oh wait, nevermind.

6708
05:14:57,470 --> 05:14:57,650
Oh.

6709
05:14:58,710 --> 05:15:00,670
There was the strange ult.

6710
05:15:01,430 --> 05:15:01,950
I'm ulting.

6711
05:15:02,210 --> 05:15:03,170
Strange ult.

6712
05:15:03,310 --> 05:15:03,310
Strange ult.

6713
05:15:03,390 --> 05:15:03,390
Strange ult.

6714
05:15:03,570 --> 05:15:04,810
Black Panther low.

6715
05:15:06,190 --> 05:15:06,990
No, no, no.

6716
05:15:06,990 --> 05:15:07,270
No support.

6717
05:15:08,630 --> 05:15:09,650
No support.

6718
05:15:09,690 --> 05:15:10,290
They're coming over.

6719
05:15:11,150 --> 05:15:11,530
It's safe.

6720
05:15:11,570 --> 05:15:11,850
It's safe.

6721
05:15:11,950 --> 05:15:12,230
We got this.

6722
05:15:12,290 --> 05:15:12,570
We got this.

6723
05:15:12,690 --> 05:15:12,910
Yeah.

6724
05:15:13,230 --> 05:15:14,050
Luna's coming in now.

6725
05:15:14,150 --> 05:15:14,750
Luna's coming in.

6726
05:15:16,990 --> 05:15:17,370
Nice.

6727
05:15:20,290 --> 05:15:22,230
Panther's still low.

6728
05:15:22,290 --> 05:15:22,950
Panther's still low.

6729
05:15:22,950 --> 05:15:23,290
Panther's still low.

6730
05:15:30,060 --> 05:15:31,240
Oh, slept Black Panther.

6731
05:15:31,360 --> 05:15:31,860
Slept Black Panther.

6732
05:15:31,960 --> 05:15:32,180
Right here.

6733
05:15:32,240 --> 05:15:32,360
Right here.

6734
05:15:32,400 --> 05:15:32,560
Right here.

6735
05:15:34,200 --> 05:15:34,700
He's low.

6736
05:15:34,760 --> 05:15:35,020
He's low.

6737
05:15:38,100 --> 05:15:39,120
I stunned her.

6738
05:15:40,340 --> 05:15:41,260
Oh, magic one.

6739
05:15:43,400 --> 05:15:44,880
Oh my god, I hate this Black Panther.

6740
05:15:45,040 --> 05:15:45,720
I'm gonna fuck you.

6741
05:15:47,920 --> 05:15:48,960
Wakanda no more.

6742
05:16:04,530 --> 05:16:04,890
Oh.

6743
05:16:06,370 --> 05:16:09,010
Oh, I might be dead to this.

6744
05:16:13,370 --> 05:16:14,130
Oh, Psylocke's half.

6745
05:16:14,210 --> 05:16:14,610
Psylocke low.

6746
05:16:15,130 --> 05:16:16,450
You only have one support right now.

6747
05:16:17,370 --> 05:16:18,530
There's someone to our far right.

6748
05:16:19,150 --> 05:16:20,070
I don't know who it is.

6749
05:16:23,750 --> 05:16:24,390
Psylocke on the way.

6750
05:16:24,890 --> 05:16:25,830
You only have Psylocke.

6751
05:16:25,990 --> 05:16:26,030
Psylocke.

6752
05:16:27,870 --> 05:16:28,870
Oh, Black Panther low.

6753
05:16:30,110 --> 05:16:30,830
I'm dead.

6754
05:16:32,350 --> 05:16:33,710
You still have.

6755
05:16:35,510 --> 05:16:36,490
Luna's back.

6756
05:16:36,510 --> 05:16:36,950
Our Luna's back.

6757
05:16:46,820 --> 05:16:48,120
I'm coming over.

6758
05:16:48,420 --> 05:16:49,840
I'm coming over.

6759
05:16:53,900 --> 05:16:54,360
Wait, what?

6760
05:16:54,780 --> 05:16:56,380
Oh, that's unlucky.

6761
05:16:56,840 --> 05:16:58,400
I think we should just reset and not use anything.

6762
05:16:59,080 --> 05:16:59,520
Yeah, reset.

6763
05:17:00,100 --> 05:17:01,660
I told you so.

6764
05:17:02,080 --> 05:17:03,060
I have TP.

6765
05:17:04,500 --> 05:17:07,080
I can go in with Mantis ult, too.

6766
05:17:10,240 --> 05:17:10,940
I'm back at the point.

6767
05:17:13,100 --> 05:17:13,660
C9?

6768
05:17:14,660 --> 05:17:15,220
Whoa.

6769
05:17:15,540 --> 05:17:17,360
In my one above all lobby.

6770
05:17:18,160 --> 05:17:19,620
There's a guy behind us, guys.

6771
05:17:19,860 --> 05:17:21,560
Yeah, I'm dead.

6772
05:17:23,140 --> 05:17:23,580
There's one.

6773
05:17:24,760 --> 05:17:25,680
I just won.

6774
05:17:28,780 --> 05:17:30,140
We have five ultimate.

6775
05:17:30,740 --> 05:17:31,140
Yeah.

6776
05:17:34,980 --> 05:17:36,640
I can engage with Mantis.

6777
05:17:36,840 --> 05:17:37,660
I'll engage with Mantis.

6778
05:17:39,240 --> 05:17:40,220
Oh, Mantis one.

6779
05:17:40,740 --> 05:17:42,720
I'm going to go in.

6780
05:17:42,840 --> 05:17:43,640
Three, two, one.

6781
05:17:49,260 --> 05:17:49,900
Strange is low.

6782
05:17:50,000 --> 05:17:50,260
Strange is low.

6783
05:17:52,220 --> 05:17:52,740
I'm on cart.

6784
05:17:52,740 --> 05:17:53,260
I'm on cart.

6785
05:17:55,180 --> 05:17:56,020
I'm on Strange.

6786
05:17:56,260 --> 05:17:57,160
There's somebody behind.

6787
05:17:57,620 --> 05:17:58,740
Magic's on me.

6788
05:17:59,140 --> 05:18:01,020
He TP'd somewhere.

6789
05:18:01,200 --> 05:18:01,720
I don't know where.

6790
05:18:02,680 --> 05:18:02,920
Behind.

6791
05:18:11,680 --> 05:18:13,280
I'm trying to get to you.

6792
05:18:13,920 --> 05:18:16,140
Magic and Panther are behind us, I think.

6793
05:18:17,340 --> 05:18:18,100
Magic is main.

6794
05:18:18,440 --> 05:18:19,120
Oh, Magic's main?

6795
05:18:19,220 --> 05:18:19,400
Okay.

6796
05:18:19,400 --> 05:18:21,200
Panther's behind, though.

6797
05:18:21,280 --> 05:18:24,260
He's one.

6798
05:18:24,880 --> 05:18:26,000
I have Panther on me.

6799
05:18:26,820 --> 05:18:28,360
I can Magic.

6800
05:18:36,690 --> 05:18:38,770
This stupid Panther.

6801
05:18:39,790 --> 05:18:42,710
Somebody go back and destroy Wakanda.

6802
05:18:44,250 --> 05:18:44,890
Wakanda!

6803
05:18:46,550 --> 05:18:50,370
Oh, I can't help you, sir.

6804
05:18:59,460 --> 05:19:01,800
Jesus Christ, I can't do anything.

6805
05:19:02,680 --> 05:19:04,380
Wakanda is no more.

6806
05:19:05,660 --> 05:19:08,980
Okay, I'm being harassed by this Black Panther.

6807
05:19:17,920 --> 05:19:19,140
Wakanda's not real!

6808
05:19:30,400 --> 05:19:31,860
Wakanda's not even real.

6809
05:19:31,980 --> 05:19:32,580
What do you mean?

6810
05:19:38,980 --> 05:19:40,000
Wakanda never lasts this long.

6811
05:19:42,690 --> 05:19:45,960
Someone from Wakanda, I feel offended.

6812
05:19:46,780 --> 05:19:48,280
It's not even...

6813
05:19:48,280 --> 05:19:49,520
None of this is real!

6814
05:19:50,120 --> 05:19:51,960
This is my emotion.

6815
05:19:54,940 --> 05:19:57,380
None of this is fucking real!

6816
05:19:59,400 --> 05:20:03,800
Are you a Black Panther player?

6817
05:20:04,620 --> 05:20:05,020
Yes.

6818
05:20:05,740 --> 05:20:06,300
Ah.

6819
05:20:07,440 --> 05:20:07,980
I mean, you can.

6820
05:20:10,340 --> 05:20:12,020
It's real to me.

6821
05:20:13,680 --> 05:20:14,800
Wakanda forever.

6822
05:20:16,280 --> 05:20:18,560
Might be too late at that point, but...

6823
05:20:18,560 --> 05:20:19,100
I believe in you.

6824
05:20:21,860 --> 05:20:23,640
Oh my god, this is gonna be rough.

6825
05:20:25,680 --> 05:20:26,240
Okay.

6826
05:20:29,900 --> 05:20:31,980
I'm literally watching...

6827
05:20:31,980 --> 05:20:33,240
I'm like the top 500.

6828
05:20:33,460 --> 05:20:34,680
It hasn't changed me at all.

6829
05:20:39,020 --> 05:20:41,920
Can't change me if I'm not top 500.

6830
05:20:47,200 --> 05:20:48,900
Yeah, it's so true.

6831
05:20:49,080 --> 05:20:50,300
So true, bestie.

6832
05:20:54,280 --> 05:20:55,540
I'm gonna think...

6833
05:20:55,540 --> 05:20:58,040
Oh my god!

6834
05:21:01,980 --> 05:21:03,120
I'm cocooning now.

6835
05:21:04,120 --> 05:21:06,080
I have a Luna on me.

6836
05:21:07,020 --> 05:21:08,040
Luna's behind.

6837
05:21:11,920 --> 05:21:13,280
Mantis one.

6838
05:21:13,680 --> 05:21:14,140
I got Mantis.

6839
05:21:18,280 --> 05:21:19,260
Magics one too.

6840
05:21:19,900 --> 05:21:24,800
I have a Psylocke on me.

6841
05:21:25,640 --> 05:21:26,500
She's behind.

6842
05:21:32,320 --> 05:21:33,380
I can't get to you.

6843
05:21:37,580 --> 05:21:39,040
There's Psylocke to our right.

6844
05:21:42,940 --> 05:21:44,460
I need top off.

6845
05:21:46,960 --> 05:21:47,280
I got you.

6846
05:21:50,500 --> 05:21:51,420
There's a Psylocke.

6847
05:21:51,540 --> 05:21:52,060
Oh, hi girl.

6848
05:21:55,380 --> 05:21:56,640
Psylocke's behind in Black Panther.

6849
05:21:56,720 --> 05:21:57,100
He's asleep.

6850
05:22:01,980 --> 05:22:03,040
I'm trying to keep you up.

6851
05:22:06,180 --> 05:22:07,720
I sliver.

6852
05:22:08,740 --> 05:22:12,200
I have no leaves right now.

6853
05:22:15,020 --> 05:22:17,180
Okay, I damage boosted you.

6854
05:22:19,680 --> 05:22:21,420
I'll do Mantis ult first.

6855
05:22:21,920 --> 05:22:23,660
Since I have...

6856
05:22:23,660 --> 05:22:24,840
It's fine.

6857
05:22:25,840 --> 05:22:27,080
That's unfortunate.

6858
05:22:27,080 --> 05:22:28,240
Good one, maybe?

6859
05:22:28,620 --> 05:22:29,220
It's fine.

6860
05:22:30,980 --> 05:22:31,640
Magic.

6861
05:22:31,940 --> 05:22:33,440
Magic's the lead.

6862
05:22:34,460 --> 05:22:35,360
I got it.

6863
05:22:35,700 --> 05:22:37,220
I'm ulting in.

6864
05:22:37,320 --> 05:22:40,480
Stay together.

6865
05:22:42,880 --> 05:22:47,240
Oh, that hit me.

6866
05:22:48,740 --> 05:22:49,660
I can't.

6867
05:22:49,660 --> 05:22:51,380
I got support.

6868
05:22:52,980 --> 05:22:54,040
We have...

6869
05:22:54,040 --> 05:22:56,360
Oh, our Luna died.

6870
05:22:56,720 --> 05:22:57,360
That's unfortunate.

6871
05:23:11,110 --> 05:23:16,350
That was unfortunate for our Luna.

6872
05:23:16,930 --> 05:23:17,170
It's fine.

6873
05:23:18,550 --> 05:23:19,990
We got magic.

6874
05:23:20,410 --> 05:23:21,110
She's low.

6875
05:23:24,850 --> 05:23:26,530
Oh my god.

6876
05:23:28,910 --> 05:23:31,250
I don't have any leaves right now.

6877
05:23:33,370 --> 05:23:33,970
Nice.

6878
05:23:34,390 --> 05:23:38,450
I'm pushing up.

6879
05:23:39,570 --> 05:23:40,550
There's a Black Panther.

6880
05:23:40,610 --> 05:23:41,210
There's magic behind us.

6881
05:23:41,210 --> 05:23:41,490
I'm ulting.

6882
05:23:45,530 --> 05:23:46,830
Black Panther on the right.

6883
05:23:48,930 --> 05:23:49,770
He's still on the back.

6884
05:23:51,190 --> 05:23:52,210
I didn't help.

6885
05:23:53,210 --> 05:23:54,190
You're leaving me behind.

6886
05:23:55,310 --> 05:23:56,890
I'm trying to help you right now.

6887
05:24:00,030 --> 05:24:00,350
Behind me.

6888
05:24:01,390 --> 05:24:02,210
Black Panther's low.

6889
05:24:03,490 --> 05:24:04,270
Mid shift.

6890
05:24:04,770 --> 05:24:05,530
I'm fine.

6891
05:24:05,530 --> 05:24:07,530
Oh my god.

6892
05:24:12,170 --> 05:24:13,570
Oh my god.

6893
05:24:13,610 --> 05:24:15,630
Oh, magic one.

6894
05:24:19,050 --> 05:24:20,450
Nice, nice, nice.

6895
05:24:20,570 --> 05:24:21,870
We're up two.

6896
05:24:24,310 --> 05:24:25,530
Nice, that's a huge sleep.

6897
05:24:29,670 --> 05:24:31,030
Huge sleep.

6898
05:24:31,190 --> 05:24:31,830
I did that.

6899
05:24:33,690 --> 05:24:34,570
Huge sleep.

6900
05:24:34,650 --> 05:24:35,990
That was me.

6901
05:24:37,090 --> 05:24:38,890
I did that sleep, guys.

6902
05:24:43,530 --> 05:24:43,970
Nice sleep.

6903
05:24:44,170 --> 05:24:44,710
I'm mine.

6904
05:24:45,250 --> 05:24:46,150
I'll Mantis ult first.

6905
05:24:49,590 --> 05:24:52,870
Yeah, I'll kite this for now.

6906
05:24:52,990 --> 05:24:54,290
Yeah, I'm coming.

6907
05:24:55,430 --> 05:24:56,110
They're near me.

6908
05:25:01,830 --> 05:25:07,430
I was very clear that I was gonna ult first.

6909
05:25:07,930 --> 05:25:11,470
I was very clear about it.

6910
05:25:18,950 --> 05:25:23,390
I'm going over right now.

6911
05:25:24,630 --> 05:25:25,210
I'm on it.

6912
05:25:26,430 --> 05:25:28,050
Oh, I died though.

6913
05:25:28,090 --> 05:25:28,610
I'm okay.

6914
05:25:31,830 --> 05:25:33,170
I don't have leaves.

6915
05:25:33,470 --> 05:25:36,090
I'm asleep.

6916
05:25:37,460 --> 05:25:39,050
I can cocoon on it.

6917
05:25:44,350 --> 05:25:47,430
I said Mantis ult first.

6918
05:25:47,950 --> 05:25:54,830
I was like, Mantis ult first.

6919
05:25:55,130 --> 05:25:56,990
I don't know.

6920
05:25:59,190 --> 05:26:00,050
I don't know.

6921
05:26:00,050 --> 05:26:01,090
I made it very clear.

6922
05:26:04,690 --> 05:26:06,570
I mean, we all heard it.

6923
05:26:07,030 --> 05:26:07,810
We all...

6924
05:26:07,810 --> 05:26:11,630
I don't know how she would have it low.

6925
05:26:13,750 --> 05:26:15,950
I made it very clear what my plan was.

6926
05:26:16,250 --> 05:26:18,010
I made it very clear.

6927
05:26:19,210 --> 05:26:21,650
I thought we all knew what was gonna happen.

6928
05:26:22,430 --> 05:26:26,530
This is why you don't talk about Wakanda.

6929
05:26:26,990 --> 05:26:28,990
I mean...

6930
05:26:29,610 --> 05:26:30,430
I was getting...

6931
05:26:30,430 --> 05:26:31,610
What do you want me to do?

6932
05:26:31,950 --> 05:26:33,810
He was diving me.

6933
05:26:34,550 --> 05:26:36,630
What do you want me to do?

6934
05:26:37,010 --> 05:26:37,690
Who was it?

6935
05:26:37,710 --> 05:26:38,790
This was our other Luna, right?

6936
05:26:43,140 --> 05:26:44,800
What did you want me to do?

6937
05:26:45,000 --> 05:26:45,980
I'm sorry.

6938
05:26:46,620 --> 05:26:48,060
I have to avoid you.

6939
05:26:49,040 --> 05:26:51,020
Your voice chat was too low.

6940
05:26:51,180 --> 05:26:52,320
So you get avoided.

6941
05:26:54,940 --> 05:26:57,360
How else am I gonna talk to you?

6942
05:26:57,360 --> 05:26:58,180
How?

6943
05:27:02,060 --> 05:27:04,640
This is not a me issue.

6944
05:27:05,160 --> 05:27:07,400
I said...

6945
05:27:07,400 --> 05:27:08,540
Mantis ult first.

6946
05:27:11,580 --> 05:27:13,560
It's not real!

6947
05:27:14,280 --> 05:27:16,580
They don't even have a Disneyland park.

6948
05:27:19,200 --> 05:27:22,860
They don't even have a Wakanda Disneyland.

6949
05:27:24,420 --> 05:27:25,720
That's right.

6950
05:27:25,720 --> 05:27:27,420
I said it.

6951
05:27:28,440 --> 05:27:29,740
I said it.

6952
05:27:29,980 --> 05:27:31,200
It's only real.

6953
05:27:31,300 --> 05:27:32,660
They get a world in Disneyland.

6954
05:27:34,500 --> 05:27:35,020
Wow.

6955
05:27:35,340 --> 05:27:37,640
It's real to me.

6956
05:27:39,200 --> 05:27:41,900
They wouldn't if you accepted them.

6957
05:27:43,600 --> 05:27:45,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

6958
05:27:45,780 --> 05:27:46,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

6959
05:27:47,280 --> 05:27:47,800
Francis?

6960
05:27:48,080 --> 05:27:49,420
God, I hope it's real.

6961
05:27:49,500 --> 05:27:51,580
We have a guy that says he's from France.

6962
05:27:52,700 --> 05:27:53,360
They're trying to say...

6963
05:27:53,360 --> 05:27:55,360
JokeyBirdFan69 is not real?

6964
05:27:56,060 --> 05:27:56,520
You're right.

6965
05:27:56,620 --> 05:27:57,500
I don't have...

6966
05:27:57,500 --> 05:27:59,140
That's too many fans.

6967
05:27:59,580 --> 05:28:00,040
You're right.

6968
05:28:01,300 --> 05:28:01,900
You're right.

6969
05:28:01,980 --> 05:28:03,760
69 is way too many dragons.

6970
05:28:04,480 --> 05:28:05,360
Me and my 68...

6971
05:28:07,040 --> 05:28:08,620
bots in my chat.

6972
05:28:16,240 --> 05:28:17,000
That's right.

6973
05:28:17,080 --> 05:28:18,080
The 9 was just...

6974
05:28:18,080 --> 05:28:18,780
What the...

6975
05:28:18,780 --> 05:28:22,760
That seems like a weird number.

6976
05:28:26,920 --> 05:28:28,120
I'm JokeyBirdFan1.

6977
05:28:29,360 --> 05:28:32,560
I think we kind of have to ban...

6978
05:28:33,240 --> 05:28:34,620
Hela and Hawkeye.

6979
05:28:38,380 --> 05:28:38,980
Hela...

6980
05:28:38,980 --> 05:28:39,680
and Hawkeye.

6981
05:28:40,060 --> 05:28:41,180
Hi Mono and Booger.

6982
05:28:41,320 --> 05:28:42,440
I saw you in...

6983
05:28:42,440 --> 05:28:43,980
Overwatch once.

6984
05:28:44,120 --> 05:28:44,980
Just one time?

6985
05:28:46,940 --> 05:28:48,020
Just once?

6986
05:28:48,500 --> 05:28:50,460
I believe in them to do all the bans for me.

6987
05:28:51,260 --> 05:28:52,460
Wakanda forever!

6988
05:28:53,460 --> 05:28:55,400
Thank you for the 100 bitties.

6989
05:28:55,640 --> 05:28:56,740
Thank you.

6990
05:28:58,260 --> 05:29:02,440
Kaz, thank you for the 500 bitties.

6991
05:29:02,520 --> 05:29:02,820
Thank you.

6992
05:29:03,620 --> 05:29:03,780
Psylocke?

6993
05:29:05,740 --> 05:29:06,800
Psylocke is fine.

6994
05:29:08,360 --> 05:29:10,460
I think we ban Psylocke.

6995
05:29:12,040 --> 05:29:14,280
Team, I understand why you're scared.

6996
05:29:14,440 --> 05:29:15,160
But we can win this.

6997
05:29:15,440 --> 05:29:15,580
Okay?

6998
05:29:19,460 --> 05:29:21,960
I understand why you're scared.

6999
05:29:21,960 --> 05:29:23,020
Are we scared?

7000
05:29:23,200 --> 05:29:24,700
Am I supposed to be scared?

7001
05:29:25,300 --> 05:29:27,560
What am I supposed to be scared about?

7002
05:29:29,460 --> 05:29:32,660
What am I supposed to be scared about?

7003
05:29:34,020 --> 05:29:35,300
I didn't...

7004
05:29:35,300 --> 05:29:38,980
I didn't go in here thinking I'd be scared about something.

7005
05:29:40,580 --> 05:29:43,900
I didn't know.

7006
05:29:43,900 --> 05:29:44,780
I didn't know.

7007
05:29:44,780 --> 05:29:46,620
What am I supposed to be scared about?

7008
05:29:50,880 --> 05:29:52,880
Be scared of Wakanda.

7009
05:29:53,700 --> 05:29:54,960
Do not be afraid.

7010
05:30:03,100 --> 05:30:04,280
Does she know?

7011
05:30:04,440 --> 05:30:05,220
I don't know.

7012
05:30:06,020 --> 05:30:07,240
What am I supposed to know?

7013
05:30:08,100 --> 05:30:09,820
What am I supposed to do?

7014
05:30:09,840 --> 05:30:11,420
Don't be afraid.

7015
05:30:13,440 --> 05:30:16,340
What am I supposed to be afraid about?

7016
05:30:25,540 --> 05:30:28,040
Wakanda doesn't even have a Disneyland resort!

7017
05:30:29,740 --> 05:30:32,460
Doesn't even have a LAN in Disneyland!

7018
05:30:37,260 --> 05:30:37,460
Stop!

7019
05:30:41,700 --> 05:30:43,640
The moment Wakanda gets a...

7020
05:30:43,640 --> 05:30:46,640
gets a LAN in Disneyland, I'll acknowledge Wakanda.

7021
05:30:47,460 --> 05:30:48,440
Oh, my bad.

7022
05:30:51,080 --> 05:30:52,900
I opened the portal, guys.

7023
05:31:03,120 --> 05:31:05,360
I'm a little scared here, guys.

7024
05:31:05,960 --> 05:31:06,860
Just a little bit.

7025
05:31:09,540 --> 05:31:10,880
How about Black Panther on me?

7026
05:31:14,380 --> 05:31:15,200
Kenny on me.

7027
05:31:16,640 --> 05:31:17,640
I need heals.

7028
05:31:27,720 --> 05:31:28,620
Guys,

7029
05:31:32,180 --> 05:31:32,320
okay.

7030
05:31:32,760 --> 05:31:33,800
I acknowledge Wakanda.

7031
05:31:33,880 --> 05:31:35,880
If I acknowledge Wakanda, can I survive?

7032
05:31:37,120 --> 05:31:37,820
Can I...

7033
05:31:38,640 --> 05:31:40,000
Every time!

7034
05:31:40,500 --> 05:31:41,660
Every time!

7035
05:31:44,680 --> 05:31:45,440
You're right.

7036
05:31:45,520 --> 05:31:46,660
Wakanda is real.

7037
05:31:47,380 --> 05:31:47,960
Wakanda... Oh, wait.

7038
05:31:48,040 --> 05:31:49,480
There's a Namor behind us.

7039
05:31:55,880 --> 05:31:58,600
There's a Wakanda... No, there's a Namor right behind us still.

7040
05:32:01,180 --> 05:32:02,020
Black Panther.

7041
05:32:05,260 --> 05:32:05,520
Okay.

7042
05:32:05,980 --> 05:32:07,780
Oh, there's a Wakanda cat.

7043
05:32:10,120 --> 05:32:11,080
Hey, cat.

7044
05:32:11,660 --> 05:32:12,360
Hey, cat.

7045
05:32:12,540 --> 05:32:14,620
I fucking got brain rot right now.

7046
05:32:17,340 --> 05:32:19,140
I have fucking Wakanda.

7047
05:32:19,440 --> 05:32:20,600
There's a Black Panther on me still.

7048
05:32:20,700 --> 05:32:21,100
He's half.

7049
05:32:21,860 --> 05:32:22,280
He's low.

7050
05:32:24,680 --> 05:32:25,480
Black Panther's one.

7051
05:32:25,560 --> 05:32:26,180
Black Panther's one.

7052
05:32:26,400 --> 05:32:27,860
Oh, Namor behind me.

7053
05:32:28,200 --> 05:32:28,660
I need heals.

7054
05:32:32,660 --> 05:32:33,140
Yeah.

7055
05:32:35,120 --> 05:32:36,440
I know, right?

7056
05:32:36,440 --> 05:32:36,700
Okay.

7057
05:32:40,780 --> 05:32:42,740
Black Panther's still behind me.

7058
05:32:45,160 --> 05:32:46,420
Black Panther half.

7059
05:32:55,720 --> 05:32:56,340
Berserker!

7060
05:32:58,280 --> 05:32:59,240
I'm coming, Namor.

7061
05:32:59,320 --> 05:32:59,700
I'm coming, Namor.

7062
05:33:02,520 --> 05:33:03,660
Oh, my fear!

7063
05:33:04,260 --> 05:33:06,180
I have Black Panther on me again.

7064
05:33:07,680 --> 05:33:08,980
Oh, my God!

7065
05:33:17,360 --> 05:33:18,640
Holy shit.

7066
05:33:18,920 --> 05:33:19,560
Fear.

7067
05:33:20,040 --> 05:33:28,260
Guys, if I acknowledge Wakanda cannot survive, cannot live, cannot just, you know, live for one second.

7068
05:33:28,260 --> 05:33:30,380
And Namor's always, like, in our backline.

7069
05:33:38,460 --> 05:33:40,000
Can you get top to off Mantis?

7070
05:33:43,140 --> 05:33:43,500
Oh,

7071
05:33:47,120 --> 05:33:47,540
my God.

7072
05:33:48,400 --> 05:33:48,760
Oh, yeah.

7073
05:33:48,960 --> 05:33:49,800
Black Panther to our left.

7074
05:33:58,260 --> 05:33:58,720
We got it.

7075
05:33:58,800 --> 05:33:59,180
We got it.

7076
05:33:59,820 --> 05:34:03,340
Go, go, go, go, go.

7077
05:34:03,620 --> 05:34:04,440
Oh, Black Panther behind me.

7078
05:34:05,200 --> 05:34:06,940
Black Panther behind me again.

7079
05:34:13,600 --> 05:34:14,540
Oh, my God.

7080
05:34:14,600 --> 05:34:15,320
I'm gonna ulti this in.

7081
05:34:19,520 --> 05:34:20,880
I'm capping through now.

7082
05:34:21,660 --> 05:34:22,300
Alright, I'm coming over.

7083
05:34:23,000 --> 05:34:23,640
I'm coming over.

7084
05:34:25,840 --> 05:34:26,720
Right side.

7085
05:34:26,940 --> 05:34:27,540
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny.

7086
05:34:27,700 --> 05:34:28,300
Penny frozen.

7087
05:34:28,440 --> 05:34:28,820
Penny one.

7088
05:34:31,840 --> 05:34:32,720
Namor, Namor, Namor.

7089
05:34:32,820 --> 05:34:33,320
Namor half.

7090
05:34:35,720 --> 05:34:36,580
Magina, Magina.

7091
05:34:39,280 --> 05:34:40,020
Oh, my God.

7092
05:34:40,080 --> 05:34:40,540
The reload.

7093
05:34:44,160 --> 05:34:45,260
Black Panther, Panther.

7094
05:34:50,080 --> 05:34:51,320
Oh, my God.

7095
05:34:52,680 --> 05:34:54,000
Oh, my God.

7096
05:34:54,000 --> 05:34:54,400
Oh, my...

7097
05:34:55,880 --> 05:34:58,760
In the fictional country, Marvel Rivals.

7098
05:34:59,040 --> 05:35:01,260
See, you guys know it's not real.

7099
05:35:01,940 --> 05:35:04,700
You guys even admit it's not fucking real.

7100
05:35:07,560 --> 05:35:09,160
Acknowledge Wakanda.

7101
05:35:12,120 --> 05:35:13,220
It's real.

7102
05:35:13,600 --> 05:35:15,420
You can't report a Wakanda.

7103
05:35:21,320 --> 05:35:21,600
It's good.

7104
05:35:23,500 --> 05:35:24,900
Yes, please do it.

7105
05:35:31,660 --> 05:35:32,940
That's it, Wakanda.

7106
05:35:33,260 --> 05:35:33,760
Curse back.

7107
05:35:34,060 --> 05:35:35,520
No, I acknowledge Wakanda.

7108
05:35:36,060 --> 05:35:37,480
It's a beautiful country.

7109
05:35:39,400 --> 05:35:43,840
It's a beautiful country and I love it.

7110
05:35:43,980 --> 05:35:45,080
I love Wakanda.

7111
05:35:45,440 --> 05:35:46,480
Wakanda sometimes.

7112
05:35:46,480 --> 05:35:47,260
Wakanda sometimes.

7113
05:35:50,420 --> 05:35:51,820
Wakanda sometimes.

7114
05:35:53,480 --> 05:35:55,880
Munich high and Wakanda.

7115
05:35:55,880 --> 05:35:56,140
Wakanda.

7116
05:36:15,240 --> 05:36:17,340
I can't see you, Magia.

7117
05:36:19,780 --> 05:36:20,720
I'm capping.

7118
05:36:21,440 --> 05:36:22,440
We can't see you, Magic.

7119
05:36:26,880 --> 05:36:27,280
Okay.

7120
05:36:29,860 --> 05:36:33,000
Okay, I need to get top up if you can.

7121
05:36:35,540 --> 05:36:36,340
Get him.

7122
05:36:36,420 --> 05:36:36,800
Grab him again.

7123
05:36:36,900 --> 05:36:37,260
Grab him again.

7124
05:36:40,100 --> 05:36:40,640
I'm peering.

7125
05:36:40,900 --> 05:36:41,140
I'm peering.

7126
05:36:41,240 --> 05:36:41,600
I'm peering.

7127
05:36:41,780 --> 05:36:42,040
I'm peering.

7128
05:36:43,380 --> 05:36:44,620
I got killed.

7129
05:36:49,840 --> 05:36:50,640
I'm looking.

7130
05:36:52,160 --> 05:36:52,960
I'm looking.

7131
05:36:55,520 --> 05:36:57,540
Yeah, yeah.

7132
05:36:57,840 --> 05:36:59,980
Yeah, Penny just walked up to us.

7133
05:37:01,460 --> 05:37:02,020
Sorry, guys.

7134
05:37:02,040 --> 05:37:02,820
I was killing them.

7135
05:37:03,960 --> 05:37:05,140
She did the thing again.

7136
05:37:07,400 --> 05:37:15,600
I can probably go in one minute, so I can just stick on Magic.

7137
05:37:16,000 --> 05:37:16,880
I will go in and kill her.

7138
05:37:18,720 --> 05:37:20,940
Give me an A.

7139
05:37:27,180 --> 05:37:28,800
You can get Mantis out first.

7140
05:37:38,220 --> 05:37:38,980
I'm ulting.

7141
05:37:39,120 --> 05:37:39,480
I'm ulting S.

7142
05:37:40,100 --> 05:37:40,580
Kill Penny.

7143
05:37:40,760 --> 05:37:40,900
Penny.

7144
05:37:41,100 --> 05:37:41,220
Penny.

7145
05:37:41,460 --> 05:37:41,460
Penny.

7146
05:37:41,640 --> 05:37:41,640
Penny.

7147
05:37:41,740 --> 05:37:41,800
Penny.

7148
05:37:41,960 --> 05:37:41,960
Penny.

7149
05:37:42,260 --> 05:37:42,540
I'm sleeping.

7150
05:37:42,700 --> 05:37:43,040
I'm sleeping.

7151
05:37:43,840 --> 05:37:43,900
I'm sleeping.

7152
05:37:43,900 --> 05:37:43,980
I'm sleeping.

7153
05:37:43,980 --> 05:37:44,080
Hold on.

7154
05:37:44,120 --> 05:37:44,340
Hold on.

7155
05:37:44,440 --> 05:37:44,540
Hold on.

7156
05:37:45,820 --> 05:37:47,280
Try my best.

7157
05:37:48,800 --> 05:37:50,280
Three, two, one.

7158
05:37:50,380 --> 05:37:50,900
I'm backing up.

7159
05:37:53,720 --> 05:37:54,820
I have a Bucky on me.

7160
05:37:55,160 --> 05:37:55,540
Bucky.

7161
05:37:58,500 --> 05:37:59,460
Oh my god.

7162
05:37:59,500 --> 05:38:00,560
He went full French.

7163
05:38:00,780 --> 05:38:08,520
He went fucking full French there.

7164
05:38:10,040 --> 05:38:12,120
They don't even have Black Panther.

7165
05:38:12,360 --> 05:38:13,280
What do you mean Wakanda?

7166
05:38:18,340 --> 05:38:22,200
They don't even have fucking Black Panther.

7167
05:38:22,580 --> 05:38:23,580
Who is he Wakanda?

7168
05:38:23,840 --> 05:38:25,400
Who are you guys Wakandering for?

7169
05:38:26,920 --> 05:38:27,580
I got stunned.

7170
05:38:27,700 --> 05:38:27,960
I'm one.

7171
05:38:28,040 --> 05:38:28,200
I'm one.

7172
05:38:28,320 --> 05:38:28,540
I'm dead.

7173
05:38:31,740 --> 05:38:32,220
Jesus Christ.

7174
05:38:34,440 --> 05:38:35,040
I can't see.

7175
05:38:37,320 --> 05:38:38,120
Oh my god.

7176
05:38:38,480 --> 05:38:39,320
Okay, I don't have a deal.

7177
05:38:40,680 --> 05:38:41,160
Someone's frozen.

7178
05:38:41,420 --> 05:38:41,920
I have no idea who.

7179
05:38:41,920 --> 05:38:42,440
We can win this.

7180
05:38:42,560 --> 05:38:42,920
We can win this.

7181
05:38:43,260 --> 05:38:43,680
We can win this.

7182
05:38:43,800 --> 05:38:43,800
I'm dead.

7183
05:38:43,920 --> 05:38:44,180
I'm dead.

7184
05:38:44,540 --> 05:38:45,260
I can't see you.

7185
05:38:45,340 --> 05:38:45,840
I can't see you.

7186
05:38:48,000 --> 05:38:48,600
I'm gonna go.

7187
05:38:48,660 --> 05:38:48,900
I'm gonna go.

7188
05:38:48,980 --> 05:38:49,220
I'm gonna go.

7189
05:38:49,360 --> 05:38:49,860
They don't have E though.

7190
05:38:50,160 --> 05:38:50,460
Look at Penny.

7191
05:38:50,520 --> 05:38:50,700
Penny.

7192
05:38:50,720 --> 05:38:50,920
Penny.

7193
05:38:50,920 --> 05:38:51,100
Penny.

7194
05:38:51,100 --> 05:38:51,400
Penny's low.

7195
05:38:51,460 --> 05:38:51,780
Penny's low.

7196
05:38:51,820 --> 05:38:52,160
Penny's low.

7197
05:38:52,420 --> 05:38:52,820
Penny won.

7198
05:38:52,880 --> 05:38:53,180
Penny won.

7199
05:38:53,260 --> 05:38:53,500
Penny won.

7200
05:38:53,900 --> 05:38:54,580
Penny still won.

7201
05:38:55,700 --> 05:38:56,320
Oh no.

7202
05:39:02,760 --> 05:39:03,960
I can't kill you.

7203
05:39:04,200 --> 05:39:04,640
I got you.

7204
05:39:04,760 --> 05:39:04,900
I got you.

7205
05:39:04,980 --> 05:39:05,180
I got you.

7206
05:39:05,560 --> 05:39:06,180
Iron Man is low.

7207
05:39:06,360 --> 05:39:07,080
Okay, he's getting me.

7208
05:39:09,040 --> 05:39:10,020
Oh my god.

7209
05:39:16,820 --> 05:39:17,460
I'm ulting.

7210
05:39:17,560 --> 05:39:17,740
I'm ulting.

7211
05:39:19,080 --> 05:39:19,780
Look at Penny.

7212
05:39:19,860 --> 05:39:20,180
Look at Penny.

7213
05:39:20,260 --> 05:39:20,360
Penny.

7214
05:39:20,600 --> 05:39:20,760
Penny.

7215
05:39:20,760 --> 05:39:23,360
I'm gonna look at the Iron Man.

7216
05:39:23,680 --> 05:39:26,780
I'm gonna try my best.

7217
05:39:28,540 --> 05:39:30,160
3, 2, 1.

7218
05:39:30,900 --> 05:39:31,520
I've got this.

7219
05:39:33,980 --> 05:39:34,360
Nice.

7220
05:39:34,660 --> 05:39:35,040
Very nice.

7221
05:39:35,500 --> 05:39:36,480
Did he Penny ulted?

7222
05:39:38,580 --> 05:39:39,280
One HP Bucky.

7223
05:39:39,880 --> 05:39:40,780
Oh my god.

7224
05:39:41,440 --> 05:39:43,280
Guys, maybe Iron Man close to the ult, okay?

7225
05:39:44,680 --> 05:39:46,000
Do they have Penny ult?

7226
05:39:46,200 --> 05:39:46,500
Maybe.

7227
05:39:48,060 --> 05:39:49,360
They definitely have Bucky ult for this.

7228
05:39:50,900 --> 05:39:51,980
Iron Man right here.

7229
05:39:52,020 --> 05:39:53,280
Iron Man to my left.

7230
05:39:55,140 --> 05:39:56,380
I'm gonna ult this.

7231
05:40:00,880 --> 05:40:01,600
Penny won.

7232
05:40:01,700 --> 05:40:02,120
Penny's won.

7233
05:40:02,260 --> 05:40:02,640
Penny's won.

7234
05:40:05,000 --> 05:40:05,540
Strange one.

7235
05:40:05,640 --> 05:40:05,940
Strange low.

7236
05:40:06,040 --> 05:40:06,400
Strange one.

7237
05:40:06,500 --> 05:40:08,620
I got you.

7238
05:40:09,040 --> 05:40:09,260
I got you.

7239
05:40:09,320 --> 05:40:09,600
I got you.

7240
05:40:14,060 --> 05:40:15,700
We still have like one more fight here.

7241
05:40:16,800 --> 05:40:19,080
I hope our Mantis get ult.

7242
05:40:24,300 --> 05:40:25,260
Our Mantis has ult.

7243
05:40:27,200 --> 05:40:28,700
Let's get Luna ult as well maybe.

7244
05:40:29,300 --> 05:40:29,960
I'm gonna feed you.

7245
05:40:30,240 --> 05:40:30,800
I take damage.

7246
05:40:31,740 --> 05:40:32,360
Watch out hook.

7247
05:40:32,480 --> 05:40:32,940
Watch out hook.

7248
05:40:33,060 --> 05:40:33,400
No hook.

7249
05:40:33,480 --> 05:40:33,860
No hook.

7250
05:40:34,400 --> 05:40:35,060
Iron Man behind me.

7251
05:40:35,100 --> 05:40:35,760
Iron Man behind me.

7252
05:40:35,960 --> 05:40:36,280
I froze him.

7253
05:40:36,360 --> 05:40:36,640
I froze him.

7254
05:40:36,700 --> 05:40:36,940
I froze him.

7255
05:40:37,060 --> 05:40:37,300
I froze him.

7256
05:40:37,620 --> 05:40:37,860
Turn around.

7257
05:40:37,960 --> 05:40:38,200
Turn around.

7258
05:40:38,420 --> 05:40:38,720
Get him.

7259
05:40:38,800 --> 05:40:39,060
Get him.

7260
05:40:39,180 --> 05:40:39,420
Get him.

7261
05:40:39,460 --> 05:40:39,720
Nice.

7262
05:40:39,800 --> 05:40:39,860
Nice.

7263
05:40:39,980 --> 05:40:39,980
Nice.

7264
05:40:40,220 --> 05:40:40,220
Nice.

7265
05:40:42,840 --> 05:40:43,340
I'm trying.

7266
05:40:43,400 --> 05:40:43,660
I'm trying.

7267
05:40:49,420 --> 05:40:50,660
Oh, I got hit.

7268
05:40:50,760 --> 05:40:51,420
I got hit.

7269
05:40:54,240 --> 05:40:54,720
Please.

7270
05:40:54,840 --> 05:40:55,700
I'm so close.

7271
05:40:55,760 --> 05:40:56,280
I gotta look out.

7272
05:40:58,400 --> 05:40:59,860
Just play on me again.

7273
05:41:05,800 --> 05:41:07,460
Three, two, one.

7274
05:41:12,460 --> 05:41:13,840
I should've saved it.

7275
05:41:13,920 --> 05:41:14,800
I should've saved it.

7276
05:41:15,400 --> 05:41:16,700
Bro, I'm going on that point.

7277
05:41:16,700 --> 05:41:17,060
I don't care.

7278
05:41:17,200 --> 05:41:17,720
I don't care.

7279
05:41:17,720 --> 05:41:18,380
I'm going there.

7280
05:41:18,580 --> 05:41:19,340
I believe.

7281
05:41:21,100 --> 05:41:21,880
One by one.

7282
05:41:21,980 --> 05:41:22,340
I'm coming now.

7283
05:41:22,360 --> 05:41:23,160
I'm touching, bro.

7284
05:41:26,040 --> 05:41:27,440
I'm getting the minefield.

7285
05:41:27,780 --> 05:41:28,220
Minefield is down.

7286
05:41:28,320 --> 05:41:28,760
Minefield is down.

7287
05:41:29,660 --> 05:41:30,160
Nice.

7288
05:41:31,620 --> 05:41:32,800
Maybe we can get ult.

7289
05:41:37,480 --> 05:41:40,440
Try to still leave that game, Papaya.

7290
05:41:44,280 --> 05:41:46,600
Bro, I had such a good freeze.

7291
05:41:46,700 --> 05:41:47,120
Still!

7292
05:41:51,540 --> 05:41:54,520
Bro, my freeze was fucking insane there.

7293
05:41:55,300 --> 05:41:57,180
It was actually such a good freeze.

7294
05:41:57,300 --> 05:41:58,420
That was a game changer.

7295
05:42:01,180 --> 05:42:02,380
For Wakanda.

7296
05:42:02,840 --> 05:42:04,840
He's not even in the game anymore.

7297
05:42:05,800 --> 05:42:06,500
He's not.

7298
05:42:08,100 --> 05:42:10,080
He's not even in the game.

7299
05:42:12,820 --> 05:42:13,880
Okay, we got this.

7300
05:42:18,280 --> 05:42:22,120
Travis, make Doki believe in Wakanda.

7301
05:42:30,620 --> 05:42:32,520
You repaid my freeze.

7302
05:42:32,740 --> 05:42:33,460
That's true.

7303
05:42:49,360 --> 05:42:51,480
Don't be scared.

7304
05:42:52,480 --> 05:42:54,480
But I'm scared.

7305
05:42:56,280 --> 05:42:58,980
What a fucking statement.

7306
05:42:59,520 --> 05:43:01,260
Don't be scared.

7307
05:43:03,420 --> 05:43:04,780
What a fucking statement.

7308
05:43:05,780 --> 05:43:06,240
Actually.

7309
05:43:10,300 --> 05:43:11,900
I need to be top of Mantis.

7310
05:43:21,480 --> 05:43:22,300
Penny, penny, penny.

7311
05:43:24,440 --> 05:43:25,820
Try to Q, I'm trying to Q.

7312
05:43:31,940 --> 05:43:32,920
Train, train, train.

7313
05:43:36,980 --> 05:43:37,520
That's huge.

7314
05:43:37,680 --> 05:43:38,080
That's good ult.

7315
05:43:39,220 --> 05:43:39,940
Fuck you ult.

7316
05:43:41,180 --> 05:43:42,560
I can ult after this.

7317
05:43:44,220 --> 05:43:44,960
I'm near reload.

7318
05:43:49,720 --> 05:43:50,300
I'm ulting.

7319
05:43:51,040 --> 05:43:51,880
I'm ulting this.

7320
05:43:57,080 --> 05:43:57,620
I'm okay.

7321
05:43:57,680 --> 05:43:57,960
I'm okay.

7322
05:43:58,040 --> 05:43:58,360
I'm okay.

7323
05:43:59,860 --> 05:44:00,340
That's huge.

7324
05:44:00,400 --> 05:44:00,860
That's a huge ult.

7325
05:44:00,900 --> 05:44:01,400
That's a huge ult.

7326
05:44:04,600 --> 05:44:06,540
Did they use both support ults?

7327
05:44:06,820 --> 05:44:07,480
Or just one?

7328
05:44:07,900 --> 05:44:08,520
Yeah, they did.

7329
05:44:08,860 --> 05:44:12,640
Okay, because I only saw Mantis.

7330
05:44:12,760 --> 05:44:13,240
I wasn't sure.

7331
05:44:13,240 --> 05:44:15,620
Might have Viki.

7332
05:44:19,460 --> 05:44:20,920
Okay, look behind.

7333
05:44:26,480 --> 05:44:29,300
Okay, they have Wolverine now.

7334
05:44:32,020 --> 05:44:33,460
Wolverine low.

7335
05:44:38,880 --> 05:44:40,540
Wolverine, no Passive, no Porn.

7336
05:44:43,240 --> 05:44:43,840
Viki's one behind.

7337
05:44:47,260 --> 05:44:48,240
Penny, Penny, Penny one.

7338
05:44:49,000 --> 05:44:49,720
Yep, we can.

7339
05:44:51,260 --> 05:44:52,380
I can't see you, Ironman.

7340
05:44:55,260 --> 05:44:56,680
I got you, I got you, I got you.

7341
05:44:57,400 --> 05:44:58,740
I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying.

7342
05:44:58,740 --> 05:45:00,000
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

7343
05:45:00,140 --> 05:45:02,840
You're not dying on our...

7344
05:45:03,740 --> 05:45:05,060
That's right, you're alive!

7345
05:45:06,300 --> 05:45:06,900
How can lose?

7346
05:45:07,880 --> 05:45:09,420
How can lose?

7347
05:45:10,100 --> 05:45:11,060
Do not be afraid.

7348
05:45:11,060 --> 05:45:12,500
You can touch, you can touch.

7349
05:45:13,160 --> 05:45:13,860
Mantis on me.

7350
05:45:14,220 --> 05:45:15,120
Oh, no freeze, no freeze.

7351
05:45:15,620 --> 05:45:16,880
Penny top up, top me up, top me up.

7352
05:45:26,280 --> 05:45:26,680
Nice.

7353
05:45:26,680 --> 05:45:27,080
Yippee!

7354
05:45:28,640 --> 05:45:29,440
Do not...

7355
05:45:29,440 --> 05:45:31,120
Enemy team...

7356
05:45:32,140 --> 05:45:33,420
I told you!

7357
05:45:34,180 --> 05:45:34,960
Wakanda's not real.

7358
05:45:42,020 --> 05:45:44,100
Wakanda has fallen!

7359
05:45:45,420 --> 05:45:47,120
Am I a bad guy?

7360
05:45:47,320 --> 05:45:47,960
Am I the villain?

7361
05:45:49,400 --> 05:45:52,260
Thank you for the 500 bitties.

7362
05:45:52,580 --> 05:45:54,580
Am I a villain?

7363
05:45:55,140 --> 05:45:55,920
No.

7364
05:46:00,120 --> 05:46:02,120
Wakanda sometimes...

7365
05:46:02,120 --> 05:46:03,860
Nah, I couldn't be it.

7366
05:46:04,700 --> 05:46:06,900
I always have been.

7367
05:46:11,120 --> 05:46:12,900
Wakanda made me.

7368
05:46:18,670 --> 05:46:20,230
We're definitely on...

7369
05:46:20,230 --> 05:46:21,710
We're EUing.

7370
05:46:21,770 --> 05:46:23,390
I'm EU now, let's go!

7371
05:46:27,850 --> 05:46:31,750
I can't believe I didn't bump into a fucking single...

7372
05:46:31,750 --> 05:46:36,610
I literally haven't bumped into any streamers, it's actually crazy.

7373
05:46:37,850 --> 05:46:41,870
The only streamers are literally in my stash, like all my team.

7374
05:46:41,870 --> 05:46:45,330
I bumped into Mac, but he was on the enemy team, it's actually crazy.

7375
05:46:47,630 --> 05:46:53,470
I had ShroudQE, I had Sinatraa, Dafran, TenZ, like...

7376
05:46:53,470 --> 05:46:55,230
And I never saw any of them!

7377
05:46:58,550 --> 05:47:07,680
I never saw any of them!

7378
05:47:08,500 --> 05:47:10,960
I bumped into Super, but they're always on the enemy team!

7379
05:47:10,960 --> 05:47:13,220
They're always on...

7380
05:47:13,220 --> 05:47:15,180
Yeah, I bumped into Super, but he was on the enemy team!

7381
05:47:20,560 --> 05:47:22,860
They know the truth of poke.

7382
05:47:23,440 --> 05:47:24,040
Wakanda.

7383
05:47:25,160 --> 05:47:26,440
Nice target banner.

7384
05:47:29,260 --> 05:47:31,120
No, don't ban Bruce banner, please, I beg.

7385
05:47:31,720 --> 05:47:34,260
Please ban Hawkeye or I'll end my life on VC.

7386
05:47:38,220 --> 05:47:39,420
Big mistake.

7387
05:47:40,880 --> 05:47:41,880
Big mistake.

7388
05:47:41,880 --> 05:47:43,840
Big mistake, big mistake, big mistake.

7389
05:47:45,760 --> 05:47:47,300
You and me, baby.

7390
05:47:49,180 --> 05:47:53,280
Can't lose, can't lose, can't lose, can't lose.

7391
05:47:53,680 --> 05:47:54,860
But what if they go Hulk?

7392
05:47:55,700 --> 05:47:56,740
How can we lose?

7393
05:47:57,000 --> 05:47:58,720
My Hulk dives their Hulk.

7394
05:47:59,620 --> 05:48:01,160
Our Ironman dives their Ironman.

7395
05:48:02,080 --> 05:48:03,920
Our Ironman dives their entire team.

7396
05:48:04,700 --> 05:48:05,480
Jarvis clip this.

7397
05:48:06,600 --> 05:48:08,040
Jarvis clip this.

7398
05:48:09,460 --> 05:48:10,340
Jarvis clip this.

7399
05:48:10,860 --> 05:48:13,140
I'm judging everything you do, Ironman, by the way.

7400
05:48:13,440 --> 05:48:16,040
I'm gonna watch the replay of our Ironman after this.

7401
05:48:16,920 --> 05:48:17,640
Okay, okay.

7402
05:48:17,780 --> 05:48:18,640
I'll be on it.

7403
05:48:18,860 --> 05:48:20,580
I'm gonna make a video of it.

7404
05:48:25,740 --> 05:48:28,860
I never lose a game.

7405
05:48:29,120 --> 05:48:32,140
I will let you know that me and Doki were rolling them.

7406
05:48:32,280 --> 05:48:33,120
That's so true.

7407
05:48:33,120 --> 05:48:35,320
We were winning all our games.

7408
05:48:35,340 --> 05:48:36,120
Oh no, I'm so vegan.

7409
05:48:41,140 --> 05:48:42,240
I'm so vegan.

7410
05:48:44,500 --> 05:48:45,380
Alright, DokiBerryFans69.

7411
05:48:45,640 --> 05:48:46,760
You gotta pick it up.

7412
05:48:48,060 --> 05:48:49,400
I'm picking it up as we speak.

7413
05:48:50,280 --> 05:48:51,800
I love how French you are, man.

7414
05:48:51,820 --> 05:48:52,380
It makes me happy.

7415
05:48:59,280 --> 05:49:01,320
Jarvis deleting the replay.

7416
05:49:04,100 --> 05:49:06,580
DokiBerryFans69 needs to pass his audition.

7417
05:49:19,280 --> 05:49:20,800
Triple support.

7418
05:49:20,960 --> 05:49:21,480
Triple support.

7419
05:49:23,840 --> 05:49:25,360
Play forward.

7420
05:49:26,420 --> 05:49:27,140
They have no damage.

7421
05:49:28,800 --> 05:49:30,300
Their damage is just death.

7422
05:49:33,120 --> 05:49:33,760
Just get point.

7423
05:49:35,160 --> 05:49:36,040
Can you top me off real quick?

7424
05:49:37,720 --> 05:49:39,940
Oh, I have to reload.

7425
05:49:45,640 --> 05:49:46,040
Okay,

7426
05:49:49,980 --> 05:49:50,600
we need to look now.

7427
05:49:50,960 --> 05:49:51,840
One, two, three.

7428
05:49:53,220 --> 05:49:53,980
Oh my god.

7429
05:49:54,800 --> 05:49:55,300
Get the support.

7430
05:49:57,280 --> 05:49:59,500
I have to reload.

7431
05:50:04,120 --> 05:50:05,000
I have to reload.

7432
05:50:08,120 --> 05:50:09,160
I have my ult.

7433
05:50:11,100 --> 05:50:11,800
I'll ult this.

7434
05:50:11,940 --> 05:50:12,980
We'll keep Mantis second.

7435
05:50:18,440 --> 05:50:19,000
No!

7436
05:50:21,060 --> 05:50:22,600
I'm so sad.

7437
05:50:25,360 --> 05:50:27,480
We can just stall point if we can.

7438
05:50:33,120 --> 05:50:34,060
That's really nice.

7439
05:50:38,060 --> 05:50:39,460
You're so healthy.

7440
05:50:41,640 --> 05:50:42,800
I'm not, though.

7441
05:50:44,420 --> 05:50:44,920
I'm dead.

7442
05:50:46,360 --> 05:50:47,420
You like me, Doki.

7443
05:50:47,520 --> 05:50:48,140
You said I'm healthy.

7444
05:50:49,020 --> 05:50:49,380
Alright.

7445
05:50:50,120 --> 05:50:51,540
I wasn't talking about you.

7446
05:50:54,540 --> 05:50:56,540
I was talking about the guy in front of me.

7447
05:50:56,540 --> 05:50:57,280
My bad, gang.

7448
05:51:01,080 --> 05:51:01,940
Okay, I'm reloading.

7449
05:51:02,540 --> 05:51:03,800
Let's look for one now.

7450
05:51:05,060 --> 05:51:06,980
Three, two, one.

7451
05:51:10,780 --> 05:51:11,880
I need to reload.

7452
05:51:13,200 --> 05:51:14,100
I see a Jett.

7453
05:51:14,180 --> 05:51:14,680
We're up one.

7454
05:51:24,460 --> 05:51:24,820
We're up one.

7455
05:51:24,820 --> 05:51:25,160
We got this, gang.

7456
05:51:25,240 --> 05:51:28,680
What if I hunt down their Ironman and just grab him?

7457
05:51:29,460 --> 05:51:30,000
Do it.

7458
05:51:30,040 --> 05:51:31,200
Put that in the video.

7459
05:51:33,120 --> 05:51:33,980
Put that in the video.

7460
05:51:35,020 --> 05:51:35,860
Jarvis, clip that.

7461
05:51:36,920 --> 05:51:37,800
He's on the left.

7462
05:51:45,320 --> 05:51:46,600
They're pushing now.

7463
05:51:47,340 --> 05:51:48,160
I'm frozen.

7464
05:51:48,480 --> 05:51:49,820
I don't think I can heal you.

7465
05:51:50,040 --> 05:51:50,500
I got you.

7466
05:51:51,760 --> 05:51:52,940
They have Hulk, alright.

7467
05:51:53,260 --> 05:51:53,920
I'm looking.

7468
05:51:55,940 --> 05:51:57,640
We lost one.

7469
05:51:59,020 --> 05:52:01,260
I have Hulk chasing me.

7470
05:52:02,360 --> 05:52:03,240
Jarvis, give me Jett.

7471
05:52:07,080 --> 05:52:08,760
We should just die on point.

7472
05:52:10,060 --> 05:52:10,740
That's fine.

7473
05:52:10,920 --> 05:52:11,580
My bad.

7474
05:52:15,040 --> 05:52:16,000
We don't have ult.

7475
05:52:16,360 --> 05:52:17,640
Jeff ulted.

7476
05:52:18,460 --> 05:52:19,520
Don't let me get D.Mech.

7477
05:52:20,440 --> 05:52:22,020
I'm trying my best.

7478
05:52:24,040 --> 05:52:27,160
Okay, you need to get value on your ult.

7479
05:52:27,420 --> 05:52:28,660
I'm going to look for our flank, okay?

7480
05:52:30,320 --> 05:52:31,520
They should have Hulk ult as well.

7481
05:52:32,800 --> 05:52:33,240
Nice.

7482
05:52:38,740 --> 05:52:40,540
I got Ironman.

7483
05:52:41,520 --> 05:52:42,240
That's fine.

7484
05:52:42,360 --> 05:52:44,420
We have no support.

7485
05:52:44,620 --> 05:52:45,180
We have no support.

7486
05:52:52,020 --> 05:52:53,300
We're fine.

7487
05:52:56,800 --> 05:52:57,440
Okay.

7488
05:52:59,200 --> 05:53:00,480
Jesus Christ.

7489
05:53:02,240 --> 05:53:04,120
I can ult right in with Luno.

7490
05:53:04,120 --> 05:53:04,440
I'll ult.

7491
05:53:07,340 --> 05:53:09,660
I'll ult first.

7492
05:53:09,660 --> 05:53:11,860
I'll go in 3, 2, 1.

7493
05:53:22,420 --> 05:53:23,960
3, 2, 1.

7494
05:53:24,280 --> 05:53:24,800
I don't have anymore.

7495
05:53:25,380 --> 05:53:25,920
Kill the supports.

7496
05:53:26,520 --> 05:53:30,040
I have a Magneto on me.

7497
05:53:34,200 --> 05:53:35,620
I have a Hulk on me now.

7498
05:53:39,720 --> 05:53:42,140
Hulk is on supports.

7499
05:53:44,140 --> 05:53:45,320
Jeff is low.

7500
05:53:46,200 --> 05:53:47,120
No,

7501
05:53:50,480 --> 05:53:51,880
I had...

7502
05:53:51,880 --> 05:53:52,160
Yeah.

7503
05:54:00,000 --> 05:54:01,720
Jarvis, this is real.

7504
05:54:02,360 --> 05:54:04,380
They're focusing support.

7505
05:54:05,700 --> 05:54:08,140
They're like...

7506
05:54:08,940 --> 05:54:11,500
I think we just need to play...

7507
05:54:12,400 --> 05:54:14,140
I think we just need to play...

7508
05:54:18,320 --> 05:54:22,120
The Hulk and the Magneto is just pushing the supports freely.

7509
05:54:23,580 --> 05:54:24,560
Yeah, that's...

7510
05:54:24,560 --> 05:54:25,040
That's bad.

7511
05:54:28,300 --> 05:54:30,160
They have like... Yeah, but Hulk and...

7512
05:54:30,160 --> 05:54:31,300
They had one DPS.

7513
05:54:31,920 --> 05:54:32,960
And it was three supports.

7514
05:54:34,220 --> 05:54:36,500
With Ironman, Hulk, Magneto.

7515
05:54:36,500 --> 05:54:39,480
But their Hulk literally just walks up to me.

7516
05:54:39,540 --> 05:54:40,980
And I'm like, what do I...

7517
05:54:40,980 --> 05:54:41,180
What?

7518
05:54:43,380 --> 05:54:44,900
What do I do?

7519
05:54:49,340 --> 05:54:49,940
What?

7520
05:54:50,980 --> 05:54:51,640
Hulk smash?

7521
05:54:52,260 --> 05:54:53,760
I guess I die?

7522
05:54:58,900 --> 05:55:01,580
I think our Psylocke is struggling.

7523
05:55:12,100 --> 05:55:13,500
Nice.

7524
05:55:15,900 --> 05:55:19,700
Hulk on our supports again.

7525
05:55:21,920 --> 05:55:23,540
Run, run, run, run.

7526
05:55:23,540 --> 05:55:25,600
Oh my god.

7527
05:55:25,820 --> 05:55:29,540
Oh my god.

7528
05:55:30,460 --> 05:55:33,560
Oh my god.

7529
05:55:33,660 --> 05:55:37,440
This is so funny.

7530
05:55:38,460 --> 05:55:39,740
Holy shit.

7531
05:55:45,280 --> 05:55:46,500
Oh my god.

7532
05:55:46,800 --> 05:55:47,520
That was pretty good.

7533
05:55:47,840 --> 05:55:49,040
I'm trying to keep you up.

7534
05:55:49,560 --> 05:55:49,940
I'm moving back.

7535
05:55:49,940 --> 05:55:51,760
I'm coming, I'm coming.

7536
05:55:53,060 --> 05:55:53,500
I'm on Hulk.

7537
05:55:56,180 --> 05:55:57,220
Jesus Christ, dude.

7538
05:55:57,880 --> 05:55:58,860
Your Hulk is good.

7539
05:56:00,580 --> 05:56:01,280
I'm gonna ult this.

7540
05:56:01,360 --> 05:56:02,260
I don't think that's what you guys want.

7541
05:56:06,400 --> 05:56:07,460
Oh my god.

7542
05:56:12,500 --> 05:56:13,480
We're up one.

7543
05:56:15,700 --> 05:56:16,660
I got you.

7544
05:56:16,660 --> 05:56:18,320
Nice, nice, nice.

7545
05:56:18,980 --> 05:56:20,120
Get the Hulk, get the Hulk.

7546
05:56:20,240 --> 05:56:22,020
Hulk one.

7547
05:56:35,020 --> 05:56:36,600
I stunned him, I stunned him.

7548
05:56:36,840 --> 05:56:38,100
3, 2, 1.

7549
05:56:42,280 --> 05:56:44,380
I need to get topped off, Mantis.

7550
05:56:47,300 --> 05:56:48,100
Or not.

7551
05:56:48,680 --> 05:56:49,720
I can go in with my ult.

7552
05:56:53,200 --> 05:56:57,420
I got you, I got you.

7553
05:56:58,820 --> 05:57:00,160
We got the Mantis out.

7554
05:57:03,000 --> 05:57:04,520
I have a Hulk on us.

7555
05:57:07,140 --> 05:57:08,540
I'm trying to keep you up.

7556
05:57:08,840 --> 05:57:09,680
Nice, nice, nice.

7557
05:57:10,220 --> 05:57:11,200
I'm on Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

7558
05:57:12,160 --> 05:57:13,660
I'm on Hulk right now.

7559
05:57:15,380 --> 05:57:16,920
Luna, luna, luna.

7560
05:57:17,820 --> 05:57:19,920
I got you, I got you.

7561
05:57:20,340 --> 05:57:22,000
I'm on Hulk, I'm on Hulk, I'm on Hulk.

7562
05:57:23,160 --> 05:57:24,000
We staggered him?

7563
05:57:25,620 --> 05:57:26,820
Oh fuck, he booped me.

7564
05:57:27,060 --> 05:57:28,220
Oh no, he's gonna live.

7565
05:57:36,590 --> 05:57:38,290
They have Hulk ult here.

7566
05:57:41,430 --> 05:57:42,890
I'm looking top right, by the way.

7567
05:57:46,470 --> 05:57:48,150
God, you're fucking serious.

7568
05:57:52,990 --> 05:57:53,710
I'm mad.

7569
05:57:54,970 --> 05:57:55,670
I'm mad.

7570
05:57:58,290 --> 05:57:59,670
I froze him, I froze him.

7571
05:58:01,070 --> 05:58:01,430
Oh,

7572
05:58:05,030 --> 05:58:06,270
I couldn't, I couldn't, sorry.

7573
05:58:07,250 --> 05:58:07,830
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

7574
05:58:10,470 --> 05:58:14,790
I'm on point, I'm on point, if you need heals, I'm on point.

7575
05:58:16,970 --> 05:58:17,650
I'm going first.

7576
05:58:17,910 --> 05:58:19,950
Oh, that's fucked up.

7577
05:58:20,610 --> 05:58:21,630
I'm on point, I'm on point.

7578
05:58:21,630 --> 05:58:22,750
Hulk one, Hulk one.

7579
05:58:26,110 --> 05:58:27,490
Stay on point, Kat, stay on point, Kat.

7580
05:58:28,930 --> 05:58:29,790
I'm looking at Luna, I'm looking at Luna.

7581
05:58:29,890 --> 05:58:30,930
I'm beaming Luna, I'm beaming Luna.

7582
05:58:34,610 --> 05:58:35,690
Magneo's just looking at me.

7583
05:58:38,170 --> 05:58:39,110
We never lose, we never lose.

7584
05:58:41,270 --> 05:58:42,290
That's fine, we have point, by the way.

7585
05:58:43,530 --> 05:58:44,730
Magneo, Magneo, he's just...

7586
05:58:44,730 --> 05:58:45,550
He's free shooting me.

7587
05:58:45,790 --> 05:58:47,890
Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna.

7588
05:58:56,680 --> 05:58:58,100
Oh my god.

7589
05:58:59,020 --> 05:59:01,180
Machiko, thank you for the raid.

7590
05:59:01,320 --> 05:59:02,700
Thank you, thank you.

7591
05:59:02,820 --> 05:59:04,600
For those who are new here, my name is JokeyBit.

7592
05:59:04,680 --> 05:59:08,060
I usually stream on YouTube, but I'm here on Twitch because I'm...

7593
05:59:08,060 --> 05:59:10,640
I hate myself, but I'm doing the Marvel Rivals re-engrine.

7594
05:59:11,260 --> 05:59:14,500
Yeah, I think we just keep the defensive line.

7595
05:59:16,860 --> 05:59:17,900
I just...

7596
05:59:17,900 --> 05:59:19,020
I'm just here.

7597
05:59:27,860 --> 05:59:29,500
That's fine, we're trying.

7598
05:59:29,860 --> 05:59:32,380
We're trying to get 200 points and then calling it.

7599
05:59:32,440 --> 05:59:34,920
I don't even know how long Boger's gonna be streaming for though.

7600
05:59:35,140 --> 05:59:37,240
I don't even know how long he usually streams for.

7601
05:59:37,780 --> 05:59:38,580
We're at the...

7602
05:59:38,580 --> 05:59:40,780
We're at the six hour mark now.

7603
05:59:42,180 --> 05:59:43,440
The goal is...

7604
05:59:43,440 --> 05:59:47,300
The goal is 200 points and then we'll try again tomorrow.

7605
05:59:49,100 --> 05:59:51,060
Can you stop having sex in my lobby, please?

7606
05:59:51,160 --> 05:59:51,500
Okay, bro.

7607
05:59:58,400 --> 05:59:59,200
Excuse me?

7608
06:00:02,320 --> 06:00:03,720
I don't like dual streaming.

7609
06:00:04,100 --> 06:00:07,820
I don't like splitting the audience and I don't like having to deal with two different chats.

7610
06:00:09,040 --> 06:00:10,100
Because it's like...

7611
06:00:10,100 --> 06:00:14,620
I feel like I have to balance out two chats and I can't.

7612
06:00:14,620 --> 06:00:16,940
I can't focus enough for that.

7613
06:00:19,300 --> 06:00:20,520
It's going to be me, I'm fine though.

7614
06:00:20,720 --> 06:00:21,420
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go.

7615
06:00:22,620 --> 06:00:23,500
Oh my god.

7616
06:00:23,600 --> 06:00:25,760
Oh, I tried to hook you up too.

7617
06:00:30,640 --> 06:00:31,580
We're down one.

7618
06:00:31,680 --> 06:00:32,240
We're down a support.

7619
06:00:33,840 --> 06:00:35,280
I'm on point right now.

7620
06:00:39,620 --> 06:00:41,580
I have to reload.

7621
06:00:41,580 --> 06:00:42,260
Reload.

7622
06:00:49,700 --> 06:00:53,920
Yeah, you're down three.

7623
06:00:59,640 --> 06:01:00,840
We're coming back.

7624
06:01:05,770 --> 06:01:06,630
Oh, I can't see you.

7625
06:01:06,630 --> 06:01:07,310
I can't see you for heals.

7626
06:01:11,520 --> 06:01:12,160
Okay, I got you.

7627
06:01:12,200 --> 06:01:12,460
I got you.

7628
06:01:15,680 --> 06:01:16,600
Guys, we're up.

7629
06:01:20,800 --> 06:01:22,840
I'm gonna have to save my ult for...

7630
06:01:23,980 --> 06:01:25,400
I have to save my ult for Starlord.

7631
06:01:29,700 --> 06:01:31,380
We're even, we're even right now.

7632
06:01:35,600 --> 06:01:37,000
I couldn't help you there.

7633
06:01:39,260 --> 06:01:40,260
Okay, I'll ult now.

7634
06:01:40,380 --> 06:01:41,840
They're gonna Starlord after this though.

7635
06:01:49,450 --> 06:01:51,270
Three, two, one.

7636
06:01:56,750 --> 06:01:57,950
I'm trying to help you.

7637
06:02:02,510 --> 06:02:04,010
I have a Hulk behind me.

7638
06:02:04,430 --> 06:02:05,690
Hulk is frozen, Hulk is frozen.

7639
06:02:07,370 --> 06:02:08,450
I'm a cloak, I'm a cloak.

7640
06:02:10,070 --> 06:02:11,090
I need heals, I need heals here.

7641
06:02:18,970 --> 06:02:19,530
Nice.

7642
06:02:25,050 --> 06:02:26,790
No support, no support.

7643
06:02:26,970 --> 06:02:27,630
He's one, he's one.

7644
06:02:29,110 --> 06:02:29,790
We have no support.

7645
06:02:32,770 --> 06:02:34,550
Oh my god.

7646
06:02:36,090 --> 06:02:36,910
Last fight.

7647
06:02:41,710 --> 06:02:42,910
Oh my god.

7648
06:02:49,010 --> 06:02:51,210
Jesus Christ, this Ironman is crazy though.

7649
06:02:51,210 --> 06:02:52,790
Cloak, cloak, cloak, cloak.

7650
06:02:55,670 --> 06:02:56,990
Starlord, Starlord, Starlord.

7651
06:02:57,230 --> 06:02:57,870
Italy, where's anyone?

7652
06:02:58,450 --> 06:02:59,430
Oh, I couldn't see you.

7653
06:03:06,330 --> 06:03:08,050
I can't see you, Psylocke.

7654
06:03:12,990 --> 06:03:14,390
There's an Ironman just shooting me.

7655
06:03:14,470 --> 06:03:14,990
Ironman half.

7656
06:03:16,170 --> 06:03:17,690
I froze Hulk behind me.

7657
06:03:19,090 --> 06:03:19,930
Push this, push this.

7658
06:03:20,190 --> 06:03:21,430
He's gonna, Hulk is gonna be on me.

7659
06:03:21,510 --> 06:03:22,230
Hulk is gonna be on me.

7660
06:03:23,250 --> 06:03:24,650
Let me survive for one second.

7661
06:03:28,470 --> 06:03:29,210
Kill them, no more.

7662
06:03:29,630 --> 06:03:30,850
No more ults, no more ults.

7663
06:03:34,110 --> 06:03:36,170
Mantis is like on the area of low HP by the way.

7664
06:03:36,990 --> 06:03:37,310
Yep.

7665
06:03:40,790 --> 06:03:42,250
We only have one fight here.

7666
06:03:51,500 --> 06:03:53,440
I need to back out a little.

7667
06:03:55,780 --> 06:03:57,760
We have no support ults by the way.

7668
06:03:58,200 --> 06:04:00,040
Yeah, I can't build in time too.

7669
06:04:00,840 --> 06:04:02,360
I'm asleep, I'm chilling.

7670
06:04:09,380 --> 06:04:10,240
Can you reload?

7671
06:04:10,580 --> 06:04:10,580
Can you reload?

7672
06:04:11,080 --> 06:04:12,560
I have a Starlord on me.

7673
06:04:15,800 --> 06:04:17,460
We have no supports.

7674
06:04:21,000 --> 06:04:22,040
That's unlucky.

7675
06:04:24,360 --> 06:04:25,800
Mantis is coming back right now.

7676
06:04:29,740 --> 06:04:30,300
No!

7677
06:04:33,420 --> 06:04:33,980
No!

7678
06:04:38,180 --> 06:04:39,380
Oh, yeah.

7679
06:04:51,800 --> 06:04:53,780
I did everything I could.

7680
06:04:54,120 --> 06:04:56,520
Oh my god, I freezed every time I could dive.

7681
06:04:56,640 --> 06:04:57,320
I tried to freeze.

7682
06:04:58,460 --> 06:04:59,780
Those two ults.

7683
06:05:00,180 --> 06:05:01,820
That's so cruel.

7684
06:05:02,360 --> 06:05:04,320
That's so cruel.

7685
06:05:06,140 --> 06:05:07,400
Holy fuck.

7686
06:05:08,540 --> 06:05:09,060
Guys.

7687
06:05:11,720 --> 06:05:14,320
Guys, I think this Ironman dipped us.

7688
06:05:21,920 --> 06:05:23,660
You're right, it wasn't our Ironman.

7689
06:05:23,800 --> 06:05:25,320
It was our Psylocke, you're right.

7690
06:05:29,380 --> 06:05:30,300
You're right.

7691
06:05:30,420 --> 06:05:31,160
It was our Ironman.

7692
06:05:31,320 --> 06:05:32,340
It was our Psylocke.

7693
06:05:36,400 --> 06:05:38,900
No, Psylocke was definitely not doing well.

7694
06:05:39,180 --> 06:05:45,060
Because our Psylocke wasn't doing well, their team got more space than us.

7695
06:05:45,600 --> 06:05:49,020
I saw our Psylocke solo ult a fucking Hulk.

7696
06:05:49,480 --> 06:05:50,760
That was...

7697
06:05:53,160 --> 06:05:55,480
That was pretty bad.

7698
06:05:57,600 --> 06:06:00,000
Oh my god.

7699
06:06:01,060 --> 06:06:05,300
Our Psylocke solo ulted Hulk.

7700
06:06:07,280 --> 06:06:10,480
It was pretty cool.

7701
06:06:15,080 --> 06:06:18,020
That's why I waited.

7702
06:06:19,160 --> 06:06:21,500
I hope he...

7703
06:06:23,260 --> 06:06:26,620
having a good Sunday.

7704
06:06:27,820 --> 06:06:28,420
Is today Sunday?

7705
06:06:29,080 --> 06:06:29,880
Or is today Saturday?

7706
06:06:32,140 --> 06:06:33,160
I lost track.

7707
06:06:33,220 --> 06:06:34,020
Oh, it is.

7708
06:06:39,240 --> 06:06:40,300
Thank you.

7709
06:06:40,560 --> 06:06:41,640
So positive.

7710
06:06:42,680 --> 06:06:46,260
And I hope someone loves him.

7711
06:06:57,410 --> 06:07:01,410
Because he's not getting that on the internet.

7712
06:07:05,130 --> 06:07:05,830
Alright.

7713
06:07:07,490 --> 06:07:08,810
Anyway.

7714
06:07:09,650 --> 06:07:10,390
Anyway.

7715
06:07:12,310 --> 06:07:14,850
It's Monday in Wakanda.

7716
06:07:17,590 --> 06:07:20,730
Casual Rivals Gaming.

7717
06:07:21,370 --> 06:07:23,670
That's so mean.

7718
06:07:24,990 --> 06:07:26,450
In Marvel Rev.

7719
06:07:26,590 --> 06:07:27,230
In game.

7720
06:07:28,410 --> 06:07:29,470
There you go.

7721
06:07:29,810 --> 06:07:33,130
It makes it a lot better if you put in game.

7722
06:07:34,430 --> 06:07:35,070
In game.

7723
06:07:38,080 --> 06:07:40,360
No, we're ending it at 200.

7724
06:07:40,660 --> 06:07:41,360
Or 150.

7725
06:07:41,760 --> 06:07:43,180
I'm just gonna...

7726
06:07:43,180 --> 06:07:43,720
You know what?

7727
06:07:43,780 --> 06:07:44,360
Or 150.

7728
06:07:44,460 --> 06:07:45,220
I'll settle.

7729
06:07:46,740 --> 06:07:48,300
I'm willing to settle.

7730
06:07:49,120 --> 06:07:51,560
I'm willing to settle at 150.

7731
06:07:55,960 --> 06:07:57,460
No, guys.

7732
06:07:57,780 --> 06:07:58,960
Guys, don't say that.

7733
06:07:59,400 --> 06:07:59,920
Guys.

7734
06:08:01,140 --> 06:08:04,580
Guys, we can settle for 150.

7735
06:08:07,300 --> 06:08:08,380
Guys, no, no.

7736
06:08:08,480 --> 06:08:09,000
It's fine.

7737
06:08:09,120 --> 06:08:10,280
We can do... I believe.

7738
06:08:11,740 --> 06:08:12,420
Where did I start at?

7739
06:08:12,440 --> 06:08:15,640
I started at 66, so like we're up technically.

7740
06:08:16,480 --> 06:08:17,040
We're up.

7741
06:08:17,720 --> 06:08:23,720
If we do 150 and then maybe we can get 250 next time.

7742
06:08:24,900 --> 06:08:25,860
I believe.

7743
06:08:27,760 --> 06:08:28,260
It's alright.

7744
06:08:28,440 --> 06:08:29,340
I took a nap before.

7745
06:08:29,840 --> 06:08:32,120
I took a nap before I started my stream.

7746
06:08:32,420 --> 06:08:36,480
I mean, I was gonna start my stream early and then I fucking took a nap early.

7747
06:08:40,440 --> 06:08:41,920
So, it'll be fine.

7748
06:08:42,360 --> 06:08:43,180
I believe.

7749
06:08:43,540 --> 06:08:44,380
What could go wrong?

7750
06:08:44,820 --> 06:08:45,900
Absolutely nothing.

7751
06:08:46,300 --> 06:08:47,460
As long as we keep believing.

7752
06:08:48,380 --> 06:08:53,380
Guys, I need you to believe in me more, guys.

7753
06:08:53,980 --> 06:08:55,540
This is the reason.

7754
06:08:55,940 --> 06:08:58,000
We just need more people to believe.

7755
06:08:58,880 --> 06:08:59,740
Then we'll be fine.

7756
06:09:01,240 --> 06:09:02,260
No, I do not drop.

7757
06:09:03,240 --> 06:09:07,200
We're in a state of mind where we don't drop.

7758
06:09:07,400 --> 06:09:10,100
I wish there was like custom lobbies to pass the time.

7759
06:09:11,000 --> 06:09:13,340
Or like um...

7760
06:09:14,100 --> 06:09:14,580
um...

7761
06:09:15,260 --> 06:09:17,380
I wish there was like just...

7762
06:09:19,060 --> 06:09:19,780
Let's see.

7763
06:09:20,000 --> 06:09:21,140
I wish I had a better item.

7764
06:09:21,820 --> 06:09:30,220
I was watching like a pro Adam player and like literally all he solo carries as Adam is actually crazy.

7765
06:09:30,500 --> 06:09:31,440
I don't remember his name.

7766
06:09:32,120 --> 06:09:36,440
But like, he would literally get like...

7767
06:09:37,580 --> 06:09:42,880
He would get like four kills by himself and then just carry the game.

7768
06:09:43,140 --> 06:09:43,480
Damn it.

7769
06:09:49,480 --> 06:09:54,060
He said I play like super... You gotta be like super restrained.

7770
06:09:54,740 --> 06:09:55,920
Wait, are we back in NA?

7771
06:09:56,620 --> 06:09:57,860
Did we gave up on EU?

7772
06:10:02,560 --> 06:10:04,720
I don't know if we gave up on EU.

7773
06:10:16,800 --> 06:10:21,220
Do I watch any of the top 500 low-key players?

7774
06:10:22,460 --> 06:10:23,020
No.

7775
06:10:23,420 --> 06:10:25,040
I know they're really good.

7776
06:10:25,440 --> 06:10:29,360
I've seen like a lot of like the low-key players are low-key one tricks.

7777
06:10:32,280 --> 06:10:32,840
What?

7778
06:10:36,560 --> 06:10:38,480
Did he just say he's a squirrel girl player?

7779
06:10:38,660 --> 06:10:39,320
What's wrong?

7780
06:10:43,320 --> 06:10:43,880
What?

7781
06:10:52,840 --> 06:11:02,840
I've seen like really good low-key players and they're like it's actually like, it's really interesting watching them play because people are figuring out how to play low-key now.

7782
06:11:03,880 --> 06:11:08,460
People are figuring out how to play low-key now and it's like, it's all like mind games.

7783
06:11:08,460 --> 06:11:12,880
Go Adam and make your dreams reality and become the Adam goat.

7784
06:11:17,520 --> 06:11:20,080
Nothing wrong with squirrel girl, Doki.

7785
06:11:20,260 --> 06:11:21,800
Don't be sexy.

7786
06:11:22,100 --> 06:11:24,760
Like I said, don't be sexiest.

7787
06:11:28,340 --> 06:11:30,540
Don't be sexiest.

7788
06:11:32,700 --> 06:11:34,440
I'm literally playing Luna.

7789
06:11:34,580 --> 06:11:35,300
What the fuck?

7790
06:11:36,260 --> 06:11:38,040
Not all women.

7791
06:11:44,600 --> 06:11:45,520
Jesus

7792
06:11:48,980 --> 06:11:50,260
Christ, how do you have Lord?

7793
06:11:51,140 --> 06:11:53,000
Lord, which end?

7794
06:11:53,160 --> 06:11:53,780
Squirrel girl?

7795
06:11:55,540 --> 06:11:55,940
How?

7796
06:11:58,860 --> 06:12:02,640
What do you mean she's pretty mid?

7797
06:12:05,300 --> 06:12:06,600
What the fuck do you mean?

7798
06:12:07,460 --> 06:12:08,580
Look at her!

7799
06:12:10,080 --> 06:12:10,260
What?

7800
06:12:10,560 --> 06:12:11,660
Look at that!

7801
06:12:14,360 --> 06:12:16,540
All cake is good cake.

7802
06:12:20,260 --> 06:12:21,300
Doesn't matter.

7803
06:12:24,620 --> 06:12:25,200
Okay.

7804
06:12:27,260 --> 06:12:27,940
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

7805
06:12:28,700 --> 06:12:30,380
Wait, there's an Iron Fist behind us.

7806
06:12:31,040 --> 06:12:32,700
No parries, no parries.

7807
06:12:33,320 --> 06:12:34,560
There's no parries, there's no parries.

7808
06:12:34,720 --> 06:12:35,220
Yeah, yeah.

7809
06:12:35,580 --> 06:12:37,420
I have two.

7810
06:12:42,640 --> 06:12:44,180
Mag, mag, mag, mag.

7811
06:12:44,220 --> 06:12:44,760
I need a reload.

7812
06:12:46,940 --> 06:12:48,420
No parries, no parries.

7813
06:12:48,980 --> 06:12:49,640
We can die, baby.

7814
06:12:51,700 --> 06:12:52,480
I need a reload.

7815
06:12:57,040 --> 06:12:58,140
Oh, I'm gonna die.

7816
06:12:59,380 --> 06:13:00,260
There's an Iron Fist!

7817
06:13:00,440 --> 06:13:01,060
Frozen Iron Fist!

7818
06:13:01,180 --> 06:13:01,760
Frozen Iron Fist!

7819
06:13:02,380 --> 06:13:03,260
I tried, I tried.

7820
06:13:04,420 --> 06:13:05,780
I have Iron Fist on me still.

7821
06:13:18,040 --> 06:13:20,180
Everybody ignored Iron Fist.

7822
06:13:28,820 --> 06:13:29,260
Alright.

7823
06:13:33,420 --> 06:13:34,580
Oh my god.

7824
06:13:44,420 --> 06:13:47,380
That's fine, that's fine.

7825
06:13:48,300 --> 06:13:49,640
Oh, Iron Fist is behind us.

7826
06:13:49,700 --> 06:13:50,480
Iron Fist behind us.

7827
06:13:51,860 --> 06:13:53,160
I have Dull, I have Dull.

7828
06:13:57,460 --> 06:13:59,660
Iron Fist has their ult though.

7829
06:14:03,880 --> 06:14:05,760
No more is behind us, no more is behind us.

7830
06:14:07,240 --> 06:14:08,600
I might be dead, I'm dead here.

7831
06:14:15,180 --> 06:14:15,900
We have...

7832
06:14:15,900 --> 06:14:19,460
No more, no more, no more.

7833
06:14:20,520 --> 06:14:20,920
Alright.

7834
06:14:22,400 --> 06:14:23,420
Punisher's low, Punisher's low.

7835
06:14:31,500 --> 06:14:33,700
They still have Iron Fist ult, they haven't used it yet.

7836
06:14:34,700 --> 06:14:35,760
Did they punish ult yet?

7837
06:14:35,820 --> 06:14:36,040
Or no?

7838
06:14:39,280 --> 06:14:43,000
I froze Penny, I froze Penny.

7839
06:14:45,300 --> 06:14:46,600
Iron Fist one, Iron Fist one!

7840
06:14:46,600 --> 06:14:47,880
I got him, I got him, I got him.

7841
06:14:50,540 --> 06:14:53,940
I have to reload, I have to reload.

7842
06:14:56,260 --> 06:14:59,180
She does, but she's not doing anything.

7843
06:15:00,320 --> 06:15:01,840
Watch this, watch this, watch this.

7844
06:15:02,260 --> 06:15:03,480
They're gonna have...

7845
06:15:03,920 --> 06:15:05,360
They have both DPS ult here.

7846
06:15:06,160 --> 06:15:07,480
Oh, they're more behind us, they're more behind.

7847
06:15:08,660 --> 06:15:09,520
I'm really low.

7848
06:15:09,520 --> 06:15:10,180
No more.

7849
06:15:11,280 --> 06:15:14,320
No bubble, no shield, no shield, no shield.

7850
06:15:16,800 --> 06:15:17,860
He's still behind.

7851
06:15:19,140 --> 06:15:22,080
Sorry, I had to heal so many people.

7852
06:15:23,440 --> 06:15:23,960
Is this winnable?

7853
06:15:24,100 --> 06:15:24,560
I can ult.

7854
06:15:28,260 --> 06:15:29,360
I'm gonna ult this, I'm gonna ult this.

7855
06:15:35,280 --> 06:15:36,580
I'm ulting for her, I'm ulting for her.

7856
06:15:36,580 --> 06:15:37,280
I damage boost you.

7857
06:15:38,180 --> 06:15:40,000
Penny to the left, Penny and Iron Fist to the left.

7858
06:15:44,440 --> 06:15:46,480
Penny is half, Penny is low, Penny is half.

7859
06:15:48,840 --> 06:15:50,820
Namor is behind us again, Namor is behind.

7860
06:15:54,860 --> 06:15:56,160
They double, they support ult.

7861
06:16:03,220 --> 06:16:04,700
There's a Namor behind, there's a Namor behind.

7862
06:16:06,580 --> 06:16:07,260
I'm low, I'm low.

7863
06:16:08,020 --> 06:16:10,180
I'm trying to save our Mantis right now.

7864
06:16:14,460 --> 06:16:15,700
I got you.

7865
06:16:15,900 --> 06:16:17,740
Oh, I don't.

7866
06:16:24,700 --> 06:16:26,220
Oh my god.

7867
06:16:30,630 --> 06:16:32,370
Guys, I'm gonna say it.

7868
06:16:32,850 --> 06:16:34,650
I don't think Scarlet Witch was it.

7869
06:16:39,670 --> 06:16:41,910
Iron Fist is zoning the supports out.

7870
06:16:49,730 --> 06:16:51,430
Iron Fist, Namor is behind us.

7871
06:16:51,490 --> 06:16:52,530
Namor is on our Mantis.

7872
06:16:55,770 --> 06:16:57,670
I'm gonna test Namor.

7873
06:17:01,370 --> 06:17:01,830
Try.

7874
06:17:05,130 --> 06:17:06,330
Wait, Iron Fist is one.

7875
06:17:06,330 --> 06:17:07,810
I got you, I got you, I got you booger.

7876
06:17:13,290 --> 06:17:14,450
We're up, we're up too.

7877
06:17:14,630 --> 06:17:15,110
We're literally up too.

7878
06:17:15,670 --> 06:17:16,230
We should push up.

7879
06:17:22,450 --> 06:17:24,310
Penny, Penny frozen, Penny frozen half.

7880
06:17:24,590 --> 06:17:24,710
One.

7881
06:17:27,830 --> 06:17:29,050
Mantis low first, so we have to.

7882
06:17:31,250 --> 06:17:31,830
Iron Fist.

7883
06:17:32,770 --> 06:17:33,890
Iron Fist one still.

7884
06:17:37,170 --> 06:17:38,750
Iron Fist still one.

7885
06:17:40,610 --> 06:17:42,650
Namor behind us again.

7886
06:17:44,630 --> 06:17:45,890
Namor one.

7887
06:17:49,230 --> 06:17:50,150
Alright.

7888
06:17:52,650 --> 06:17:53,870
We Mantis ult first.

7889
06:17:56,510 --> 06:17:58,850
Oh, that's rough buddy.

7890
06:18:00,470 --> 06:18:01,570
That's rough.

7891
06:18:06,330 --> 06:18:07,230
Oh, he's fucking bugged out.

7892
06:18:12,930 --> 06:18:14,430
Namor to our left, Namor to our left.

7893
06:18:14,550 --> 06:18:16,030
Again, on me, he's frozen, he's frozen.

7894
06:18:17,130 --> 06:18:19,350
I need help, I need help.

7895
06:18:20,690 --> 06:18:22,090
Can you put a TP in front of them?

7896
06:18:22,470 --> 06:18:22,730
No.

7897
06:18:23,150 --> 06:18:24,470
I'm sorry.

7898
06:18:24,790 --> 06:18:27,870
I can stun left door in a second.

7899
06:18:28,370 --> 06:18:29,270
I'm watching right door.

7900
06:18:30,230 --> 06:18:31,270
I'm pushing right.

7901
06:18:37,210 --> 06:18:38,390
Iron Fist behind us.

7902
06:18:38,590 --> 06:18:39,350
Iron Fist on cart.

7903
06:18:39,770 --> 06:18:42,010
I'm frozen, I'm frozen, I can't do anything about it though.

7904
06:18:43,850 --> 06:18:45,210
I'm ulting, I'm ulting on point.

7905
06:18:46,370 --> 06:18:47,230
I'm on point.

7906
06:18:52,170 --> 06:18:53,970
If you need heals, I'm on cart.

7907
06:19:00,430 --> 06:19:01,850
No parries, no parries.

7908
06:19:06,330 --> 06:19:06,870
I need to get out of here.

7909
06:19:08,030 --> 06:19:09,190
Oh my god.

7910
06:19:09,410 --> 06:19:12,150
You're the walled off, booger.

7911
06:19:14,770 --> 06:19:16,590
No wall can contain me.

7912
06:19:18,230 --> 06:19:20,150
You just died though?

7913
06:19:21,230 --> 06:19:22,630
I've been spawned.

7914
06:19:23,990 --> 06:19:26,810
I'm alive, I'm well and alive.

7915
06:19:27,030 --> 06:19:28,350
Oh, so true, so true.

7916
06:19:35,960 --> 06:19:37,300
Yeah, I'm taking an off angle.

7917
06:19:37,300 --> 06:19:38,680
He's on me, he's on me by the way.

7918
06:19:39,580 --> 06:19:40,700
I can't help you there.

7919
06:19:41,060 --> 06:19:41,720
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

7920
06:19:50,220 --> 06:19:50,780
I'm reloading.

7921
06:19:54,100 --> 06:19:55,200
I'm on grid, grid, grid's up.

7922
06:19:55,260 --> 06:19:55,960
Grid one, grid one.

7923
06:20:03,680 --> 06:20:04,320
Grid one.

7924
06:20:05,160 --> 06:20:06,180
I might be dead to this.

7925
06:20:06,300 --> 06:20:07,900
I have ult, I'm gonna use it.

7926
06:20:10,080 --> 06:20:11,180
We can mantis ult after.

7927
06:20:14,660 --> 06:20:15,400
Luna, Luna on me.

7928
06:20:15,480 --> 06:20:16,500
Luna on cart, Luna on cart.

7929
06:20:24,360 --> 06:20:25,600
Huge no crew ult.

7930
06:20:28,640 --> 06:20:30,080
Oh my god.

7931
06:20:30,200 --> 06:20:32,520
I got Luna ult so fast there.

7932
06:20:33,920 --> 06:20:35,360
Nice, they burned all.

7933
06:20:37,560 --> 06:20:40,960
Guys, also travel over and push.

7934
06:20:40,960 --> 06:20:42,560
I'm like at a baseball game.

7935
06:20:42,620 --> 06:20:43,600
I just watched you hit a fucking...

7936
06:20:48,840 --> 06:20:50,820
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

7937
06:20:53,140 --> 06:20:54,080
I'm proud of that.

7938
06:20:56,580 --> 06:20:58,100
Was he ulting?

7939
06:20:58,340 --> 06:21:00,220
Did he ulted in the middle of my freeze?

7940
06:21:00,620 --> 06:21:02,060
I couldn't tell, it was reflex.

7941
06:21:03,460 --> 06:21:04,500
I'm kidding.

7942
06:21:05,680 --> 06:21:07,820
It was literally reflex for that freeze.

7943
06:21:14,300 --> 06:21:15,200
Proud nonetheless.

7944
06:21:16,280 --> 06:21:18,080
Oh shit, I didn't realize.

7945
06:21:18,540 --> 06:21:20,380
That was so intentional guys.

7946
06:21:21,780 --> 06:21:23,480
JK, of course I knew.

7947
06:21:23,560 --> 06:21:24,540
I'm fucking gamer.

7948
06:21:25,400 --> 06:21:27,120
Of fucking course I knew guys.

7949
06:21:27,940 --> 06:21:30,600
You keep saying we can't lose, yet we lose.

7950
06:21:30,780 --> 06:21:31,980
Yeah, didn't you say...

7951
06:21:31,980 --> 06:21:34,160
Yeah, you said we were gonna dip that R man.

7952
06:21:34,220 --> 06:21:34,880
What happened?

7953
06:21:35,860 --> 06:21:36,980
What happened bro?

7954
06:21:37,580 --> 06:21:39,580
We were getting that video ready.

7955
06:21:40,600 --> 06:21:42,600
My editor was ready to edit that video.

7956
06:21:44,080 --> 06:21:46,300
This was a flipping design, a lie.

7957
06:21:46,780 --> 06:21:50,940
90% of Ironman players int just before they make it into a YouTube video.

7958
06:21:51,120 --> 06:21:52,080
It is.

7959
06:21:55,800 --> 06:22:00,060
It's not okay.

7960
06:22:01,440 --> 06:22:02,400
It's not okay.

7961
06:22:02,760 --> 06:22:04,000
Don't be sending your assassins.

7962
06:22:05,600 --> 06:22:06,600
Be ready for the ult.

7963
06:22:10,200 --> 06:22:10,700
I'm looking.

7964
06:22:15,720 --> 06:22:16,180
I'm on them.

7965
06:22:17,160 --> 06:22:18,080
I froze the group.

7966
06:22:19,780 --> 06:22:21,240
There's an Amour behind us again.

7967
06:22:28,880 --> 06:22:29,860
He's still in there.

7968
06:22:29,940 --> 06:22:30,420
I see him, yeah.

7969
06:22:34,940 --> 06:22:39,060
Oh, I'm getting healed by the turrets.

7970
06:22:41,520 --> 06:22:42,120
Okay, I'm looking.

7971
06:22:42,260 --> 06:22:42,960
I'm healing your tanks then.

7972
06:22:44,140 --> 06:22:44,500
I'm stunned.

7973
06:22:46,100 --> 06:22:48,040
I'm stunned and quiet.

7974
06:22:49,700 --> 06:22:50,420
I'm blinked.

7975
06:22:50,420 --> 06:22:53,040
This Amour plays so fucking weird.

7976
06:22:54,840 --> 06:22:55,960
I have to reload, I have to reload.

7977
06:22:56,640 --> 06:22:57,200
You're good, you're good.

7978
06:22:57,860 --> 06:22:58,100
Let's kill the one.

7979
06:23:02,660 --> 06:23:05,040
This is real firepower.

7980
06:23:05,500 --> 06:23:06,300
Kill him in, kill him in.

7981
06:23:08,340 --> 06:23:10,120
I'm gonna hit a big one, I'm gonna hit a big one.

7982
06:23:12,280 --> 06:23:13,120
I believe.

7983
06:23:13,940 --> 06:23:15,040
There's an Amour turret.

7984
06:23:20,880 --> 06:23:21,980
Nice peek, nice peek.

7985
06:23:22,180 --> 06:23:22,680
I'm back, I'm back.

7986
06:23:23,020 --> 06:23:24,120
Yeah, I'm not using ult yet.

7987
06:23:26,660 --> 06:23:27,480
Amour turret, right?

7988
06:23:27,560 --> 06:23:28,760
He's by himself, he's out of position.

7989
06:23:33,120 --> 06:23:35,320
They have Moon Knight group combo, careful.

7990
06:23:36,700 --> 06:23:37,340
Moon Knight dead.

7991
06:23:38,740 --> 06:23:40,080
I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

7992
06:23:44,300 --> 06:23:46,340
Alright, that's okay, I guess.

7993
06:23:47,200 --> 06:23:48,420
That's a bad problem, that's a bad problem.

7994
06:23:48,640 --> 06:23:49,520
We don't have any combo anymore.

7995
06:23:49,840 --> 06:23:50,860
They still have Moon Knight ult here.

7996
06:23:52,600 --> 06:23:55,440
Okay, so when they Moon Knight ult, guys, we move away from them.

7997
06:23:57,140 --> 06:23:57,940
W palms.

7998
06:23:59,460 --> 06:23:59,940
I'm safe.

7999
06:24:00,420 --> 06:24:01,460
Making sure you guys know.

8000
06:24:01,660 --> 06:24:02,840
Oh, I hit the...

8001
06:24:06,180 --> 06:24:07,920
There's an Amour turret, right?

8002
06:24:08,160 --> 06:24:09,260
I got it.

8003
06:24:11,160 --> 06:24:14,420
Yeah, yeah, you're also the only one left.

8004
06:24:18,300 --> 06:24:20,040
Yeah, you're right, nobody died.

8005
06:24:24,760 --> 06:24:28,580
I don't think so, I don't think so.

8006
06:24:37,770 --> 06:24:38,590
That's five.

8007
06:24:39,050 --> 06:24:40,310
We're so healthy.

8008
06:24:42,130 --> 06:24:43,050
They still have the Amour ult.

8009
06:24:45,010 --> 06:24:46,410
They have the Amour and Raccoon ult.

8010
06:24:47,970 --> 06:24:50,170
Oh, we're down a healer, it's just me.

8011
06:24:55,910 --> 06:24:58,050
I'm like really low, I need a health pack.

8012
06:25:02,750 --> 06:25:04,290
You're walled off, you're walled off.

8013
06:25:08,490 --> 06:25:09,350
I'm gonna look, okay?

8014
06:25:09,450 --> 06:25:10,950
You're still walled off, okay, gotcha, gotcha.

8015
06:25:18,730 --> 06:25:21,350
Nice, that's two, that's two.

8016
06:25:21,450 --> 06:25:23,270
I'm on the Amour, Amour half, Amour half.

8017
06:25:25,330 --> 06:25:27,030
Punisher behind you guys, Punisher behind.

8018
06:25:31,630 --> 06:25:32,990
Alright, you can farm...

8019
06:25:33,450 --> 06:25:34,410
Spoiled here, I already have mine.

8020
06:25:37,310 --> 06:25:39,110
I'm gonna just heal the squishies.

8021
06:25:44,150 --> 06:25:46,170
They're gonna have Moon Groot ult again.

8022
06:25:57,670 --> 06:25:58,150
Nice,

8023
06:26:05,050 --> 06:26:06,270
I'll let you farm the ults here.

8024
06:26:07,830 --> 06:26:10,210
Nah, nah, nah, that guy's not killable, no, no, no.

8025
06:26:10,410 --> 06:26:13,170
Yeah, kite back, kite back, kite back, we're a bit too open right now.

8026
06:26:13,350 --> 06:26:13,970
He's gonna beam us.

8027
06:26:16,410 --> 06:26:17,430
And we need to combo...

8028
06:26:17,430 --> 06:26:18,150
Oh my god.

8029
06:26:19,390 --> 06:26:20,410
I have to do this.

8030
06:26:20,470 --> 06:26:21,290
We have Men's ult again.

8031
06:26:27,110 --> 06:26:29,370
I'll do my Men's, it's hard to pull off to be honest.

8032
06:26:29,530 --> 06:26:30,230
Yeah, I know, I know.

8033
06:26:32,210 --> 06:26:34,050
Oh my god, not the fuck, no.

8034
06:26:35,010 --> 06:26:35,570
Stupid ult.

8035
06:26:37,070 --> 06:26:41,450
Oh, oh, oh, you are alive!

8036
06:26:41,930 --> 06:26:42,610
Holy shit.

8037
06:26:44,250 --> 06:26:50,230
Okay, we have to use both support ults there to stabilize.

8038
06:26:56,690 --> 06:26:59,330
They use like all their DPS ults though.

8039
06:27:00,710 --> 06:27:02,390
Other than Punisher, they still have Punisher ult.

8040
06:27:07,730 --> 06:27:09,090
Yeah, bro, me, yeah.

8041
06:27:12,950 --> 06:27:14,550
I'm kiting out, I'm kiting out.

8042
06:27:17,030 --> 06:27:18,810
They still have Punisher ult, they still have Punisher ult.

8043
06:27:23,070 --> 06:27:23,470
I believe,

8044
06:27:26,670 --> 06:27:27,970
I believe Doki bro fans.

8045
06:27:27,970 --> 06:27:29,610
I have Wolverine on me upstairs.

8046
06:27:35,990 --> 06:27:39,090
There's three people, I froze Groot to my right.

8047
06:27:40,690 --> 06:27:41,630
Groot's on me, Groot's on me.

8048
06:27:47,810 --> 06:27:51,190
I got you, I got you, I got you.

8049
06:27:51,190 --> 06:27:52,450
Okay, okay, we're good, we're good.

8050
06:27:56,170 --> 06:27:57,970
If we kill them now, this could be last fight.

8051
06:27:59,350 --> 06:28:00,290
I have to reload, I have to reload.

8052
06:28:00,550 --> 06:28:01,490
There's a turret, there's a turret.

8053
06:28:01,690 --> 06:28:03,770
Don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die.

8054
06:28:09,030 --> 06:28:11,470
Yeah, we had two support ults here for last fight.

8055
06:28:17,030 --> 06:28:17,810
Nice, he's dead.

8056
06:28:17,810 --> 06:28:19,470
I'm being caught.

8057
06:28:20,090 --> 06:28:20,830
We're getting them all, we're getting them all.

8058
06:28:20,870 --> 06:28:21,630
No more, no more, no more.

8059
06:28:21,730 --> 06:28:23,210
Oh my god.

8060
06:28:25,490 --> 06:28:26,410
I'm okay.

8061
06:28:28,550 --> 06:28:30,070
Yo, yo, yo.

8062
06:28:30,310 --> 06:28:31,010
I love you.

8063
06:28:31,130 --> 06:28:32,370
I love you too.

8064
06:28:32,570 --> 06:28:33,390
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8065
06:28:33,710 --> 06:28:34,070
GG.

8066
06:28:34,350 --> 06:28:35,090
I'm sorry about that.

8067
06:28:35,230 --> 06:28:36,970
Oh my god.

8068
06:28:38,150 --> 06:28:40,410
The Wolverine saved me.

8069
06:28:41,510 --> 06:28:42,630
Holy shit.

8070
06:28:43,310 --> 06:28:47,190
The Wolverine saved me from the fucking No More Hells insane.

8071
06:28:48,730 --> 06:28:50,110
I was like, thank you.

8072
06:28:53,310 --> 06:28:55,870
Doki, we're number one.

8073
06:28:58,560 --> 06:29:00,410
You saved me from the well.

8074
06:29:01,070 --> 06:29:02,610
What a, what a guy.

8075
06:29:04,550 --> 06:29:05,610
What a guy.

8076
06:29:06,510 --> 06:29:08,630
I always believed in him.

8077
06:29:09,090 --> 06:29:12,230
Bro, I was absolutely a bigger fan of you.

8078
06:29:13,290 --> 06:29:14,510
The ult saved Doki.

8079
06:29:14,690 --> 06:29:15,910
Oh, thank you Wolverine.

8080
06:29:16,150 --> 06:29:17,510
Thank you for kidnapping me.

8081
06:29:17,810 --> 06:29:19,170
Shout out to that guy.

8082
06:29:19,350 --> 06:29:20,790
Where the fuck is Jimbo?

8083
06:29:20,970 --> 06:29:21,970
Jimbo Limbo.

8084
06:29:22,490 --> 06:29:24,070
Well, I'll never know.

8085
06:29:25,490 --> 06:29:27,450
Down this president.

8086
06:29:30,290 --> 06:29:32,730
The Wolverine was like, no.

8087
06:29:34,650 --> 06:29:35,450
Save her.

8088
06:29:39,530 --> 06:29:40,330
Groot.

8089
06:29:40,430 --> 06:29:42,010
Guys, what do you think Groot God plays?

8090
06:29:47,950 --> 06:29:49,950
I think the Groot God 69.

8091
06:29:53,410 --> 06:29:54,130
Damn, same.

8092
06:29:54,410 --> 06:29:54,970
For real, for real.

8093
06:29:57,670 --> 06:30:01,730
Sadly, Boger is the only player that I think can play Strange better than me, so I won't ego the pick.

8094
06:30:03,190 --> 06:30:03,890
The goat.

8095
06:30:05,270 --> 06:30:06,850
I need a Strange God 69.

8096
06:30:08,390 --> 06:30:08,630
Okay.

8097
06:30:09,490 --> 06:30:10,710
Okay, Groot God was taken.

8098
06:30:10,910 --> 06:30:12,350
I had to throw something in there.

8099
06:30:12,410 --> 06:30:14,990
It was going to be 69 420, but I thought that was a little bit too much.

8100
06:30:16,950 --> 06:30:18,330
But they banned Hulk for us.

8101
06:30:18,330 --> 06:30:18,910
He's weak.

8102
06:30:19,110 --> 06:30:19,730
Nice people.

8103
06:30:20,890 --> 06:30:21,330
Weak.

8104
06:30:24,740 --> 06:30:26,840
The 69 guys are with us today.

8105
06:30:27,060 --> 06:30:27,720
What if they think we're...

8106
06:30:27,720 --> 06:30:31,800
Nah, well, guys, the etiquette is that if they're supposed to ban Hawkeye, we're supposed to ban something else.

8107
06:30:32,040 --> 06:30:32,520
Like, so...

8108
06:30:32,520 --> 06:30:32,840
No.

8109
06:30:34,620 --> 06:30:36,840
I refuse to ban anything else.

8110
06:30:37,080 --> 06:30:37,320
Ah, nope, they're assholes.

8111
06:30:37,560 --> 06:30:39,880
Their assholes, their assholes, their assholes.

8112
06:30:39,900 --> 06:30:41,140
Or the 69 squads.

8113
06:30:41,440 --> 06:30:46,000
I would add 69 after Doki Bird, but I'm worried somebody's going to take Doki Bird right after.

8114
06:30:47,280 --> 06:30:49,980
I'm worried people are going to squat Doki Bird.

8115
06:30:50,680 --> 06:30:51,240
Right?

8116
06:30:51,720 --> 06:30:53,340
Bro, did I tell you guys?

8117
06:30:54,420 --> 06:30:55,260
The moment...

8118
06:30:55,540 --> 06:30:56,300
The moment...

8119
06:30:56,300 --> 06:30:56,800
The day...

8120
06:30:56,800 --> 06:30:57,300
I did, I did.

8121
06:30:57,360 --> 06:31:07,160
The day I came back to streaming, literally the day it was announced I was back, someone instantly took Doki Bird.com and is squatting it.

8122
06:31:07,220 --> 06:31:08,880
And is actually holding it hostage.

8123
06:31:08,880 --> 06:31:09,520
Like...

8124
06:31:11,980 --> 06:31:16,320
That's why I claim Doki Bird and as many things as I can.

8125
06:31:16,740 --> 06:31:18,080
No, it's true.

8126
06:31:18,380 --> 06:31:18,960
They literally...

8127
06:31:18,960 --> 06:31:19,720
I looked it up.

8128
06:31:19,960 --> 06:31:24,640
They made the website the day I came back.

8129
06:31:25,960 --> 06:31:27,380
They didn't make it before.

8130
06:31:27,780 --> 06:31:30,120
They made it the day I came back.

8131
06:31:30,340 --> 06:31:30,760
It could work.

8132
06:31:31,020 --> 06:31:32,880
Listen, Doki, you're going to be fighting there.

8133
06:31:33,060 --> 06:31:33,920
Like, it's going to...

8134
06:31:34,420 --> 06:31:34,560
What?

8135
06:31:34,780 --> 06:31:35,260
Nah, nah, nah.

8136
06:31:35,460 --> 06:31:36,100
Wait, what?

8137
06:31:36,260 --> 06:31:36,820
It's going to be...

8138
06:31:40,800 --> 06:31:43,120
You're going to be on the front lines over there.

8139
06:31:43,180 --> 06:31:45,020
No, I didn't fucking try and buy it.

8140
06:31:45,060 --> 06:31:47,300
They're going to ask for a million dollars or something.

8141
06:31:47,620 --> 06:31:49,740
Let them waste money on that domain.

8142
06:31:49,880 --> 06:31:50,840
I don't fucking care.

8143
06:31:51,340 --> 06:31:54,060
Let them waste their money just holding it hostage.

8144
06:31:57,920 --> 06:32:02,360
Wait, what do you think he's going to do?

8145
06:32:03,420 --> 06:32:04,260
Dinky dinky.

8146
06:32:06,540 --> 06:32:07,460
Captain America.

8147
06:32:08,140 --> 06:32:09,180
Behind us, behind us.

8148
06:32:11,840 --> 06:32:12,360
Captain...

8149
06:32:14,260 --> 06:32:16,260
I think I have Iron Fist too.

8150
06:32:16,820 --> 06:32:17,480
I'm a little scared.

8151
06:32:19,460 --> 06:32:22,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

8152
06:32:23,240 --> 06:32:24,680
I have Captain America on me.

8153
06:32:27,180 --> 06:32:28,700
I have Iron Fist on me now.

8154
06:32:32,360 --> 06:32:35,660
What do we do?

8155
06:32:35,680 --> 06:32:40,520
What do we do?

8156
06:32:45,940 --> 06:32:47,380
There's a cap on us.

8157
06:32:47,660 --> 06:32:49,380
He's blocked my freeze.

8158
06:32:52,860 --> 06:32:56,220
I need help.

8159
06:32:59,000 --> 06:33:00,500
There's a Magneto on us.

8160
06:33:02,360 --> 06:33:04,200
And a Captain America too.

8161
06:33:15,280 --> 06:33:16,400
Bro,

8162
06:33:27,720 --> 06:33:28,520
I'm scared.

8163
06:33:32,360 --> 06:33:33,320
I don't think you're fine.

8164
06:33:36,900 --> 06:33:38,620
He blocked my freeze.

8165
06:33:39,140 --> 06:33:40,540
Iron Fist on me, Iron Fist on me, Iron Fist.

8166
06:33:42,680 --> 06:33:43,940
Oh my god.

8167
06:33:48,380 --> 06:33:53,680
Guys, this is the worst game for a support player.

8168
06:33:57,900 --> 06:34:00,320
This is fucking terrible.

8169
06:34:02,460 --> 06:34:04,280
I killed both of you.

8170
06:34:04,320 --> 06:34:05,660
Oh shit.

8171
06:34:07,060 --> 06:34:08,640
I don't know what's going on.

8172
06:34:11,180 --> 06:34:12,480
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

8173
06:34:12,680 --> 06:34:13,560
Stay on me.

8174
06:34:13,740 --> 06:34:14,640
Thank you, good ult, good ult.

8175
06:34:14,760 --> 06:34:15,660
Very good ult, very good ult.

8176
06:34:17,800 --> 06:34:19,000
Support's in the air, back.

8177
06:34:20,200 --> 06:34:22,280
Cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap.

8178
06:34:23,380 --> 06:34:24,580
No, no, we have...

8179
06:34:25,200 --> 06:34:26,300
Bro's cap, bro's cap.

8180
06:34:27,500 --> 06:34:29,040
Mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag.

8181
06:34:31,320 --> 06:34:33,800
Huffer, wolf, huffer, wolf, huffer, wolf.

8182
06:34:33,960 --> 06:34:36,460
Mag, mag, mag.

8183
06:34:38,320 --> 06:34:40,440
What the fuck happened?

8184
06:34:41,960 --> 06:34:44,000
I can't even tell what happened.

8185
06:34:44,520 --> 06:34:45,000
What,

8186
06:34:48,380 --> 06:34:49,300
what happened?

8187
06:34:50,120 --> 06:34:51,080
This guy's trying to win.

8188
06:34:51,820 --> 06:34:52,540
Found trouble.

8189
06:34:54,120 --> 06:34:54,680
Kept up, right?

8190
06:34:56,100 --> 06:34:57,160
I'm aiming cap, I'm aiming cap.

8191
06:34:57,740 --> 06:34:58,100
Ironfist?

8192
06:34:59,260 --> 06:35:01,620
The Ironfist is looking to push supports.

8193
06:35:02,840 --> 06:35:03,540
Cap dead, cap dead, cap dead.

8194
06:35:05,040 --> 06:35:07,840
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

8195
06:35:07,900 --> 06:35:08,480
He ult, he ult.

8196
06:35:09,340 --> 06:35:09,700
Berserker.

8197
06:35:12,720 --> 06:35:17,780
Oh my god.

8198
06:35:18,680 --> 06:35:19,380
Ironfist's behind.

8199
06:35:19,380 --> 06:35:22,720
Yeah, yeah, he's looking to flank us.

8200
06:35:23,240 --> 06:35:24,380
He's right here.

8201
06:35:28,420 --> 06:35:29,580
He's like...

8202
06:35:30,980 --> 06:35:32,260
He's still up there.

8203
06:35:34,500 --> 06:35:36,360
I'm a little scared of the Ironfist.

8204
06:35:42,920 --> 06:35:44,600
Ironfist behind me, Ironfist.

8205
06:35:50,860 --> 06:35:51,800
Ironfist, nice.

8206
06:35:55,500 --> 06:35:56,260
Oh my god.

8207
06:35:59,180 --> 06:36:01,660
Do you want Cloak or Luna ult first?

8208
06:36:06,140 --> 06:36:08,860
Okay, okay, Luna ult, Luna ult.

8209
06:36:08,920 --> 06:36:10,020
I'll Luna the Wolverine ult.

8210
06:36:16,800 --> 06:36:18,480
Oh, that scared me.

8211
06:36:21,060 --> 06:36:21,940
He's on me.

8212
06:36:22,100 --> 06:36:23,200
I've frozen, I've frozen, I've frozen.

8213
06:36:24,960 --> 06:36:27,240
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

8214
06:36:29,780 --> 06:36:31,320
Yeah, that's good.

8215
06:36:32,040 --> 06:36:33,740
We just need to kill the Luna after.

8216
06:36:37,100 --> 06:36:38,460
Kill Luna after this, kill Luna.

8217
06:36:38,940 --> 06:36:40,320
Oh, the Ironfist is here too.

8218
06:36:40,420 --> 06:36:41,100
I'm dead to this.

8219
06:36:43,320 --> 06:36:44,360
I'm dead, I'm dead to it.

8220
06:36:45,740 --> 06:36:46,180
I'm alive.

8221
06:36:50,440 --> 06:36:52,560
Trench, Trench, Trench.

8222
06:36:54,200 --> 06:36:55,200
Trench one.

8223
06:36:55,620 --> 06:36:56,600
I have to reload, I have to reload.

8224
06:37:06,340 --> 06:37:07,860
Thank you.

8225
06:37:09,960 --> 06:37:10,980
Nice, nice.

8226
06:37:13,040 --> 06:37:15,340
Oh my god.

8227
06:37:15,980 --> 06:37:16,420
Holy shit.

8228
06:37:17,200 --> 06:37:18,040
MagnetoGod69, seriously.

8229
06:37:18,040 --> 06:37:19,140
Oh my god.

8230
06:37:19,720 --> 06:37:21,040
The Ironfist.

8231
06:37:22,980 --> 06:37:24,060
I just healed.

8232
06:37:24,760 --> 06:37:26,400
I just, I just healed.

8233
06:37:27,020 --> 06:37:29,400
Oh my god, that was so scary.

8234
06:37:38,740 --> 06:37:41,440
Is that your American accent?

8235
06:37:48,440 --> 06:37:49,640
Hell yeah.

8236
06:37:51,600 --> 06:37:53,180
I think it's like, and women.

8237
06:37:53,460 --> 06:37:55,420
I said like, what you don't...

8238
06:37:55,420 --> 06:37:57,660
I was just gonna say, Europeans don't love women?

8239
06:37:58,260 --> 06:38:00,100
Why is women so specific?

8240
06:38:02,960 --> 06:38:05,500
Not the in and out.

8241
06:38:05,600 --> 06:38:06,840
The southern friend.

8242
06:38:08,720 --> 06:38:12,820
I would love to have a DC rivals.

8243
06:38:14,800 --> 06:38:17,120
Cause it would be like, Batman doesn't kill.

8244
06:38:20,680 --> 06:38:21,900
USA, healing my warrior.

8245
06:38:24,840 --> 06:38:26,580
I thought I was gonna fuck it up.

8246
06:38:27,460 --> 06:38:28,440
Oh, they're to the left, they're to the left.

8247
06:38:29,900 --> 06:38:31,380
There's four under, there's four under.

8248
06:38:31,520 --> 06:38:32,220
There's four under here.

8249
06:38:33,360 --> 06:38:35,500
Yeah, the cap's there.

8250
06:38:37,520 --> 06:38:39,220
There's an Ironfist right behind you guys.

8251
06:38:44,200 --> 06:38:45,780
There's an Ironfist coming to us.

8252
06:38:45,880 --> 06:38:46,400
Coming to support.

8253
06:38:49,160 --> 06:38:50,940
I have a captain on me.

8254
06:38:54,680 --> 06:38:55,740
That was good.

8255
06:38:56,020 --> 06:38:57,280
Far most guys, far most.

8256
06:38:59,420 --> 06:39:00,600
I froze cloak.

8257
06:39:04,340 --> 06:39:05,740
Oh wait, is this winnable?

8258
06:39:06,140 --> 06:39:07,140
I can...

8259
06:39:07,140 --> 06:39:08,100
Yes, yes.

8260
06:39:08,140 --> 06:39:09,380
Okay, okay, I'm ulting this in.

8261
06:39:11,220 --> 06:39:13,060
Let's go kill the Captain America.

8262
06:39:15,000 --> 06:39:16,980
God, I saw you miss that.

8263
06:39:18,840 --> 06:39:20,480
Wait, did you see what I just hit?

8264
06:39:20,640 --> 06:39:25,040
I might be fucking dead.

8265
06:39:25,900 --> 06:39:27,240
Oh, I'm definitely dead.

8266
06:39:33,100 --> 06:39:34,100
Luna's one, Luna's one.

8267
06:39:35,220 --> 06:39:35,660
Nah, I got it.

8268
06:39:35,780 --> 06:39:37,260
You owe me a cloak heals.

8269
06:39:39,040 --> 06:39:39,500
Okay, okay, okay.

8270
06:39:40,700 --> 06:39:42,280
I was like, woah.

8271
06:39:43,220 --> 06:39:43,660
Goodbye.

8272
06:39:43,940 --> 06:39:45,360
Captain America's coming back now.

8273
06:39:49,460 --> 06:39:50,600
Unchested, no you.

8274
06:39:57,940 --> 06:40:00,420
Oh, goodbye to map change, map change, booger.

8275
06:40:01,300 --> 06:40:02,140
Guys, guys.

8276
06:40:03,000 --> 06:40:03,780
Map change.

8277
06:40:03,980 --> 06:40:04,520
Don't worry about it.

8278
06:40:04,940 --> 06:40:08,320
I'm gonna give you a little tip, but map change is exactly 50%.

8279
06:40:08,320 --> 06:40:09,040
Oh, really?

8280
06:40:09,040 --> 06:40:12,300
It's 50% changes, yes, but even if it's combined.

8281
06:40:14,960 --> 06:40:17,160
Yeah, Ducky is a noob.

8282
06:40:17,480 --> 06:40:18,060
Yeah, I am.

8283
06:40:20,300 --> 06:40:21,460
Fair enough, fair enough.

8284
06:40:21,820 --> 06:40:22,940
Wait, are you boosting right now?

8285
06:40:27,400 --> 06:40:29,640
He's hot as meat, what do you mean?

8286
06:40:34,800 --> 06:40:36,940
Because I don't pay attention.

8287
06:40:37,860 --> 06:40:38,940
There you go.

8288
06:40:42,040 --> 06:40:44,020
I have a cloak on the backline.

8289
06:40:44,740 --> 06:40:46,780
I have an Iron Fist on the backline.

8290
06:40:50,380 --> 06:40:51,140
I'm on it.

8291
06:40:53,440 --> 06:40:53,940
No,

8292
06:41:02,740 --> 06:41:05,030
if I had Rosa on it, then I'm getting boosted.

8293
06:41:06,940 --> 06:41:07,020
Hi.

8294
06:41:09,630 --> 06:41:11,200
For women everywhere.

8295
06:41:15,180 --> 06:41:16,980
Oh my god.

8296
06:41:17,840 --> 06:41:19,560
Guys, why is he here?

8297
06:41:21,460 --> 06:41:22,680
Why is he here?

8298
06:41:25,200 --> 06:41:26,740
I need to get topped off.

8299
06:41:31,120 --> 06:41:34,380
Guys, hey, there's an Iron Fist right here again.

8300
06:41:36,940 --> 06:41:38,140
I'm just going to ult this in.

8301
06:41:42,580 --> 06:41:43,580
Nice, nice, nice.

8302
06:41:43,680 --> 06:41:45,000
We wasted low kill.

8303
06:41:47,240 --> 06:41:47,880
Nice.

8304
06:41:51,060 --> 06:41:54,500
Oh, there he comes.

8305
06:41:56,880 --> 06:41:59,200
Most useful Iron Fist ult.

8306
06:42:00,720 --> 06:42:02,780
To be fair, he did the burst.

8307
06:42:03,540 --> 06:42:04,200
That's crazy.

8308
06:42:06,940 --> 06:42:09,180
Bro, he kidnapped him.

8309
06:42:10,400 --> 06:42:12,180
That shit was crazy.

8310
06:42:14,660 --> 06:42:16,920
The Iron Fist will burn with it.

8311
06:42:17,160 --> 06:42:18,480
Where the fuck was the Iron Fist?

8312
06:42:18,480 --> 06:42:19,760
I was like, why is he here?

8313
06:42:20,560 --> 06:42:22,000
Get down this person.

8314
06:42:23,160 --> 06:42:24,100
Look at that.

8315
06:42:24,380 --> 06:42:26,960
That's the Doki Birdfan69 right there, guys.

8316
06:42:28,240 --> 06:42:29,660
That's him right there.

8317
06:42:32,160 --> 06:42:32,900
Do you lose?

8318
06:42:33,080 --> 06:42:33,620
Do you lose?

8319
06:42:33,640 --> 06:42:34,380
You lose less.

8320
06:42:35,160 --> 06:42:36,640
ESVP, you lose less.

8321
06:42:36,940 --> 06:42:38,360
That's how it usually goes.

8322
06:42:39,060 --> 06:42:40,260
That's crazy though.

8323
06:42:40,340 --> 06:42:41,160
The fucking...

8324
06:42:41,160 --> 06:42:44,180
The kidnap we saw there.

8325
06:42:52,250 --> 06:42:53,630
I'm going to use the bathroom, guys.

8326
06:42:53,670 --> 06:42:54,310
I'll be right back.

8327
06:43:49,130 --> 06:43:50,030
I'm back.

8328
06:43:50,930 --> 06:43:52,690
Guys, do you think we can get 200?

8329
06:43:53,050 --> 06:43:53,890
Or do we settle?

8330
06:43:54,590 --> 06:43:56,190
Do we settle?

8331
06:43:59,790 --> 06:44:00,890
Are we senators?

8332
06:44:01,670 --> 06:44:04,990
Oh my gosh, my cable is like catching on the...

8333
06:44:05,470 --> 06:44:06,610
Are we settlers?

8334
06:44:07,250 --> 06:44:07,850
Or...

8335
06:44:07,850 --> 06:44:10,770
Guys, we're at the 7 hour mark.

8336
06:44:11,810 --> 06:44:13,090
Oh my god.

8337
06:44:13,950 --> 06:44:15,010
Guys, don't say that.

8338
06:44:15,090 --> 06:44:18,210
What if we just win 3 games in a row, guys?

8339
06:44:20,430 --> 06:44:21,630
What if...

8340
06:44:22,910 --> 06:44:24,470
What if we do that?

8341
06:44:27,900 --> 06:44:28,920
Could be...

8342
06:44:29,660 --> 06:44:29,960
Guys...

8343
06:44:29,960 --> 06:44:32,980
We could just win 5 games in a row.

8344
06:44:40,030 --> 06:44:40,710
Just...

8345
06:44:40,710 --> 06:44:42,970
Could be possible.

8346
06:44:43,490 --> 06:44:44,990
I think he actually...

8347
06:44:44,990 --> 06:44:47,790
I think he actually took away Europe.

8348
06:44:48,830 --> 06:44:49,510
I think he...

8349
06:44:49,510 --> 06:44:52,550
I think they took away EU.

8350
06:44:59,490 --> 06:45:01,990
Wait, he's been trying to get Eternity.

8351
06:45:04,350 --> 06:45:06,330
Wait, what the fuck is this...

8352
06:45:06,330 --> 06:45:07,570
What the fuck?

8353
06:45:09,770 --> 06:45:12,490
Did you guys see the...

8354
06:45:12,490 --> 06:45:13,510
The matchup?

8355
06:45:26,030 --> 06:45:27,430
We're against Timmy.

8356
06:45:27,730 --> 06:45:29,870
I mean, he's been trying to get Eternity, right?

8357
06:45:32,810 --> 06:45:34,310
Or like, one above all.

8358
06:45:35,050 --> 06:45:36,630
I think he's GM1 right now, right?

8359
06:45:40,490 --> 06:45:42,650
Yeah, but I'm always playing against them.

8360
06:45:42,890 --> 06:45:44,930
I want them to be on my team.

8361
06:45:46,350 --> 06:45:47,730
I don't ask for much.

8362
06:45:47,910 --> 06:45:49,430
Just to be on my team.

8363
06:45:53,210 --> 06:45:55,090
I ask for so little.

8364
06:46:01,020 --> 06:46:03,220
Also, Gerard, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

8365
06:46:03,320 --> 06:46:04,800
Game, thank you for the tier 1.

8366
06:46:05,100 --> 06:46:06,880
Marshy, thank you for the prime.

8367
06:46:08,260 --> 06:46:10,280
And I also ask for a sponsor.

8368
06:46:10,620 --> 06:46:11,760
I ask for so little.

8369
06:46:12,320 --> 06:46:13,540
I ask for money.

8370
06:46:14,300 --> 06:46:16,630
From the game devs.

8371
06:46:16,940 --> 06:46:18,240
I ask for...

8372
06:46:20,520 --> 06:46:22,000
So little.

8373
06:46:27,080 --> 06:46:30,020
Can't even have one, the bare minimum.

8374
06:46:30,300 --> 06:46:30,720
Exactly.

8375
06:46:31,220 --> 06:46:32,680
I just want the bare minimum.

8376
06:46:36,970 --> 06:46:39,100
It's not even that much.

8377
06:46:39,100 --> 06:46:39,140
It's not even that much.

8378
06:46:43,490 --> 06:46:46,390
It took out our boy, DokiRudeFan69.

8379
06:46:50,430 --> 06:46:54,370
I just have to play 7 more hours of Marble Rivals.

8380
06:47:01,630 --> 06:47:02,610
Let's go!

8381
06:47:03,250 --> 06:47:03,810
Alright, sounds good.

8382
06:47:10,550 --> 06:47:11,030
Whee!

8383
06:47:16,190 --> 06:47:19,490
I wish I had the stamina to stream this long on YouTube.

8384
06:47:22,690 --> 06:47:24,890
If I'm playing Marble Rivals, I do.

8385
06:47:25,570 --> 06:47:27,850
Not gonna lie, if I'm playing Marble Rivals, I do.

8386
06:47:27,970 --> 06:47:29,290
But like, you know what I mean?

8387
06:47:34,220 --> 06:47:35,520
Oh shit, nice.

8388
06:47:39,660 --> 06:47:43,260
Like, if I'm just playing competitive all the time...

8389
06:47:44,940 --> 06:47:45,940
I can just...

8390
06:47:46,660 --> 06:47:47,900
I'm pushing cart right now.

8391
06:47:47,900 --> 06:47:49,020
I'm pushing cart, I'm pushing cart.

8392
06:47:51,980 --> 06:47:55,380
Okay, okay, yeah, I'll push up then.

8393
06:48:01,740 --> 06:48:05,940
I don't know, I don't know what it is about competitive...

8394
06:48:05,940 --> 06:48:07,560
that makes me like, stream...

8395
06:48:07,560 --> 06:48:08,760
that I can stream ranked.

8396
06:48:08,860 --> 06:48:09,580
Like, it doesn't even matter.

8397
06:48:09,860 --> 06:48:11,280
It can be any ranked game.

8398
06:48:11,820 --> 06:48:13,040
I can nearly...

8399
06:48:13,040 --> 06:48:14,040
There's a Gritch at right.

8400
06:48:16,540 --> 06:48:19,600
Yeah, I got crossed.

8401
06:48:23,700 --> 06:48:26,200
I don't know, it's just something about competitive...

8402
06:48:26,200 --> 06:48:28,260
that makes me like, want to stream for so long.

8403
06:48:28,340 --> 06:48:31,940
Like, it feels like hours pass by, like, so fast.

8404
06:48:32,040 --> 06:48:33,520
Alright, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

8405
06:48:33,600 --> 06:48:33,940
You guys ready?

8406
06:48:34,160 --> 06:48:35,700
3, 2, 1.

8407
06:48:37,820 --> 06:48:39,180
There's a... more on high ground.

8408
06:48:39,480 --> 06:48:40,200
Oh wait, it's just turret.

8409
06:48:45,580 --> 06:48:47,360
They broke Mantis ult for it.

8410
06:48:53,800 --> 06:48:55,160
We Mantis ult first then.

8411
06:49:00,460 --> 06:49:01,720
They have Grille too.

8412
06:49:06,000 --> 06:49:08,020
Oh my god, okay, I'm locking in guys, I'm locking in.

8413
06:49:12,040 --> 06:49:13,380
I can... I'll... Luna ult the Grille.

8414
06:49:14,980 --> 06:49:15,980
There's more to our left.

8415
06:49:22,080 --> 06:49:23,400
They have Strange ult too, careful.

8416
06:49:25,880 --> 06:49:26,420
We have blue.

8417
06:49:27,280 --> 06:49:29,560
They have no Spardos, they have no Spardos.

8418
06:49:31,380 --> 06:49:31,820
Nice.

8419
06:49:32,540 --> 06:49:33,640
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

8420
06:49:34,400 --> 06:49:35,120
They're on my point.

8421
06:49:35,640 --> 06:49:38,320
Kill Strange and Groot, they have ult.

8422
06:49:39,580 --> 06:49:40,540
I'm damage boosting.

8423
06:49:42,220 --> 06:49:43,100
Psylocke, Psylocke.

8424
06:49:43,100 --> 06:49:43,640
Psylocke behind.

8425
06:49:46,360 --> 06:49:47,080
Psylocke behind.

8426
06:49:49,820 --> 06:49:51,540
They still have Strange, they might have TP.

8427
06:49:54,220 --> 06:49:56,040
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 before they get here.

8428
06:49:57,320 --> 06:49:57,900
3 on cart.

8429
06:49:58,940 --> 06:49:59,800
Nice, we got it.

8430
06:50:00,780 --> 06:50:02,300
Yeah, they TP'd, they TP'd, they TP'd.

8431
06:50:02,640 --> 06:50:03,780
Groot is behind us.

8432
06:50:04,340 --> 06:50:04,920
Groot is behind.

8433
06:50:05,700 --> 06:50:07,900
Guys, I can kill the Groot behind us, get him.

8434
06:50:08,600 --> 06:50:11,880
You're walled off, but he's one, he's solo, he's half, he's half, he's half.

8435
06:50:15,280 --> 06:50:16,560
It's a bug stone.

8436
06:50:19,700 --> 06:50:20,620
Amour is top right.

8437
06:50:21,860 --> 06:50:22,720
Amour is right here.

8438
06:50:27,780 --> 06:50:32,160
Kill her, kill her, kill her, kill the Psylocke.

8439
06:50:32,320 --> 06:50:32,920
Psylocke one.

8440
06:50:37,600 --> 06:50:39,780
Oh my god, I'm locked in.

8441
06:50:39,800 --> 06:50:41,680
I'm getting E-speed, I'm getting E-speed, run away.

8442
06:50:43,200 --> 06:50:44,300
Got you, got you.

8443
06:50:44,880 --> 06:50:48,260
I don't have support ult for their tank ults.

8444
06:50:49,600 --> 06:50:54,140
I'm halfway too.

8445
06:50:55,040 --> 06:50:56,060
Psylocke going to the right, I think.

8446
06:50:56,640 --> 06:50:57,900
They're gonna have Groot here.

8447
06:51:01,820 --> 06:51:03,300
I, I, I throw a spring.

8448
06:51:04,420 --> 06:51:05,340
That's it, that's it, that's it.

8449
06:51:06,180 --> 06:51:07,200
Nice, nice, we got it, we got it, we got it.

8450
06:51:11,680 --> 06:51:12,740
They're all low, they're all low, they're all low.

8451
06:51:15,920 --> 06:51:17,040
I got you, I got you.

8452
06:51:18,660 --> 06:51:19,440
I'm on cart.

8453
06:51:23,180 --> 06:51:24,360
They have a Loki now.

8454
06:51:28,580 --> 06:51:29,820
Wait, Timmy's on Luna?

8455
06:51:31,500 --> 06:51:33,000
Who put Timmy on Luna?

8456
06:51:33,000 --> 06:51:33,280
Luna!

8457
06:51:40,640 --> 06:51:42,020
Why is there a Strange?

8458
06:51:44,060 --> 06:51:46,340
I'll, I'll, I'll Luna off the Strange ult.

8459
06:51:51,700 --> 06:51:53,560
I can't see you, I'm sorry.

8460
06:51:54,820 --> 06:51:56,340
You got walled off, you got walled off.

8461
06:52:04,660 --> 06:52:05,560
I didn't get you.

8462
06:52:07,460 --> 06:52:09,460
Oh, you're walled off, you're walled off, you're walled off.

8463
06:52:13,340 --> 06:52:14,820
Oh, we can Manta's ult first then.

8464
06:52:20,510 --> 06:52:21,450
Oh my god.

8465
06:52:22,490 --> 06:52:23,550
Manta's ult first if needed.

8466
06:52:25,150 --> 06:52:25,810
Alright, let's go.

8467
06:52:29,730 --> 06:52:32,330
Alright, I popped the, I popped the hibernate.

8468
06:52:32,650 --> 06:52:33,170
I'm backing off.

8469
06:52:34,190 --> 06:52:35,790
Oh, oh, what?

8470
06:52:36,170 --> 06:52:37,650
Oh, I was waiting for Manta's ult, sorry.

8471
06:52:42,310 --> 06:52:42,750
No!

8472
06:52:43,730 --> 06:52:45,430
I was like, Manta's ult?

8473
06:52:46,590 --> 06:52:47,230
Manta's ult?

8474
06:52:50,430 --> 06:52:54,530
Okay, I'm ulting in, I'm ulting in.

8475
06:53:01,140 --> 06:53:02,020
There's a lot.

8476
06:53:07,180 --> 06:53:07,920
I got a lot.

8477
06:53:08,600 --> 06:53:10,220
I'm frozen, I'm frozen, I'm frozen, I'm frozen.

8478
06:53:12,460 --> 06:53:13,060
I'm alive.

8479
06:53:13,200 --> 06:53:14,380
You're alive, you're alive, you're alive.

8480
06:53:16,020 --> 06:53:17,220
Shit, shit, shit.

8481
06:53:18,140 --> 06:53:18,880
You're walled off.

8482
06:53:21,440 --> 06:53:22,620
I can't see you.

8483
06:53:32,680 --> 06:53:34,200
They have no support ults.

8484
06:53:35,980 --> 06:53:37,120
I have mine in 20.

8485
06:53:43,360 --> 06:53:46,280
Holy shit, I'm fucking trying so hard.

8486
06:53:58,220 --> 06:53:58,780
Oh,

8487
06:54:02,520 --> 06:54:03,560
I killed through my ult.

8488
06:54:06,260 --> 06:54:06,960
I hit them all.

8489
06:54:06,960 --> 06:54:07,640
That's huge, that's huge.

8490
06:54:09,980 --> 06:54:12,020
You have no supports, you have no supports.

8491
06:54:14,300 --> 06:54:15,760
No supports, no supports.

8492
06:54:20,710 --> 06:54:21,110
No.

8493
06:54:24,730 --> 06:54:28,430
If they do, like, Groot well again, I can support ult that.

8494
06:54:32,360 --> 06:54:35,020
I don't think they'll have time for a Groot ult again, but...

8495
06:54:43,700 --> 06:54:46,300
You're walled a bit.

8496
06:54:58,160 --> 06:54:58,880
Reload.

8497
06:55:01,920 --> 06:55:03,980
They have low heal here.

8498
06:55:10,080 --> 06:55:13,820
I'm just trying my best to keep you alive.

8499
06:55:13,820 --> 06:55:15,100
You're walled off, you're walled off.

8500
06:55:16,080 --> 06:55:17,120
I forced them.

8501
06:55:17,400 --> 06:55:23,160
I got walled off here.

8502
06:55:24,880 --> 06:55:29,860
I got walled.

8503
06:55:29,920 --> 06:55:31,260
Oh, I got Groot walled.

8504
06:55:36,090 --> 06:55:37,530
That was so unlucky.

8505
06:55:38,870 --> 06:55:41,730
I don't know if you can play Moon Knight, but I can play something else.

8506
06:55:45,290 --> 06:55:46,570
That's so unlucky.

8507
06:55:50,750 --> 06:55:52,650
Well, I don't play Moon Knight.

8508
06:55:55,210 --> 06:55:56,530
What do you play?

8509
06:55:56,630 --> 06:55:58,270
Let's have a discussion here.

8510
06:56:02,050 --> 06:56:03,210
What do you play?

8511
06:56:03,210 --> 06:56:05,430
What do you play?

8512
06:56:06,770 --> 06:56:11,350
I mean, I play Sylak, I play Hela, I play Punisher, Star Lord.

8513
06:56:11,710 --> 06:56:12,190
Punisher.

8514
06:56:12,550 --> 06:56:14,150
I think Punisher works here great.

8515
06:56:14,770 --> 06:56:16,210
Punisher is going to pop off here.

8516
06:56:16,330 --> 06:56:16,970
Alright, let's do it, let's do it.

8517
06:56:20,770 --> 06:56:21,710
That's just unlucky.

8518
06:56:22,050 --> 06:56:23,750
They coordinated their ults a lot better.

8519
06:56:24,330 --> 06:56:26,010
And, like, I think...

8520
06:56:26,010 --> 06:56:26,990
We need the Mantis ult.

8521
06:56:28,870 --> 06:56:32,330
Our Mantis ulted late sometimes, which was a little tilting.

8522
06:56:32,330 --> 06:56:35,150
I was like, hello, Mantis ult first.

8523
06:56:35,350 --> 06:56:36,530
And then Star Lord was like, legendary.

8524
06:56:37,010 --> 06:56:39,170
And then he said the whole legendary.

8525
06:56:40,310 --> 06:56:41,590
And then I...

8526
06:56:41,590 --> 06:56:43,770
And I didn't get the...

8527
06:56:43,770 --> 06:56:46,350
He was like, Mantis ult where?

8528
06:56:50,150 --> 06:56:55,930
He said legendary, I died, and then I got the Mantis ult.

8529
06:56:56,370 --> 06:56:57,550
And I was like, okay.

8530
06:56:59,390 --> 06:57:00,790
Fuck me, I guess.

8531
06:57:03,450 --> 06:57:05,970
So it was like, I don't know what to do.

8532
06:57:07,630 --> 06:57:10,930
And he was like, Mantis ult first, Mantis ult first.

8533
06:57:11,430 --> 06:57:13,370
I said it like 20 times.

8534
06:57:15,290 --> 06:57:16,670
Mantis ult first.

8535
06:57:18,730 --> 06:57:22,390
I had to pre-heal that because I knew he was going to take so much fucking damage.

8536
06:57:23,670 --> 06:57:24,190
He walled off.

8537
06:57:24,510 --> 06:57:24,930
He walled off.

8538
06:57:25,290 --> 06:57:25,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8539
06:57:26,850 --> 06:57:29,310
Okay, same combo.

8540
06:57:29,590 --> 06:57:30,270
I'm going to go follow them.

8541
06:57:32,870 --> 06:57:33,570
Oh my god.

8542
06:57:33,570 --> 06:57:35,210
Oh my god.

8543
06:57:35,510 --> 06:57:37,570
Your tanks are walled off.

8544
06:57:38,970 --> 06:57:39,730
Namor's behind us.

8545
06:57:39,770 --> 06:57:40,410
Namor's behind us.

8546
06:57:42,530 --> 06:57:43,730
Namor's still behind us.

8547
06:57:45,590 --> 06:57:47,410
Bro, what do you mean, oh fuck!

8548
06:57:50,750 --> 06:57:51,810
I'm dead here, yeah?

8549
06:57:54,810 --> 06:57:56,310
Mantis, what do you mean, oh fuck!

8550
06:57:56,370 --> 06:57:57,950
We caught the point three times!

8551
06:58:03,170 --> 06:58:05,450
Mantis, what's going on?

8552
06:58:13,170 --> 06:58:16,490
I'm with you, I'm with you.

8553
06:58:18,010 --> 06:58:20,450
Change, change, change, change.

8554
06:58:22,890 --> 06:58:24,590
I have a Groot on me.

8555
06:58:25,790 --> 06:58:26,630
We walled off, walled off.

8556
06:58:28,690 --> 06:58:30,610
Sorry, I got walled off.

8557
06:58:33,790 --> 06:58:34,910
Help me, help me, heal me, heal me.

8558
06:58:34,910 --> 06:58:35,930
I'm healing, healing, healing.

8559
06:58:37,650 --> 06:58:39,430
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down.

8560
06:58:41,170 --> 06:58:44,270
I got Namor ulted.

8561
06:58:51,370 --> 06:58:56,770
That was unlucky.

8562
06:58:58,190 --> 06:59:00,070
I had to touch point two there.

8563
06:59:02,330 --> 06:59:04,170
I'm putting on bogey, I trust him more.

8564
06:59:05,150 --> 06:59:05,990
And we got our up one.

8565
06:59:09,450 --> 06:59:11,130
No, their Groot is good.

8566
06:59:11,310 --> 06:59:12,610
Their Groot is so good.

8567
06:59:18,210 --> 06:59:19,730
Namor's behind, Namor's behind us again.

8568
06:59:19,890 --> 06:59:20,850
I hit Frozen, I froze him.

8569
06:59:21,390 --> 06:59:21,910
Please, oh.

8570
06:59:23,230 --> 06:59:24,690
Wait, Mantis, heal me!

8571
06:59:25,630 --> 06:59:26,030
Mantis!

8572
06:59:29,410 --> 06:59:31,390
I'm actually mad at our Mantis.

8573
06:59:32,330 --> 06:59:36,550
Our Mantis' game awareness is so bad.

8574
06:59:39,290 --> 06:59:42,540
I've never, I've never talked shit about...

8575
06:59:43,130 --> 06:59:46,070
Oh my god, don't hurt their game awareness.

8576
06:59:46,810 --> 06:59:51,710
Their Mantis' game awareness is actually tilting me so hard.

8577
06:59:52,150 --> 06:59:54,030
Like, why would you not heal me?

8578
06:59:56,530 --> 06:59:57,950
They have Groot all here.

8579
06:59:58,630 --> 06:59:59,830
Yeah, I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

8580
07:00:02,630 --> 07:00:04,710
I can bubble you.

8581
07:00:05,070 --> 07:00:06,490
I'm coming, I'm coming.

8582
07:00:06,490 --> 07:00:07,950
They're all off here though.

8583
07:00:08,170 --> 07:00:09,150
Look at, look at them.

8584
07:00:11,710 --> 07:00:13,990
I'm with the Punisher, one heals.

8585
07:00:14,390 --> 07:00:17,630
Three, two, one, backing up now.

8586
07:00:18,850 --> 07:00:19,690
Groot one, Groot one.

8587
07:00:20,310 --> 07:00:20,830
Oh my god.

8588
07:00:24,010 --> 07:00:25,130
Jesus Christ.

8589
07:00:27,170 --> 07:00:28,490
I have to reload.

8590
07:00:29,490 --> 07:00:29,990
I'll get, I'll get.

8591
07:00:30,510 --> 07:00:31,350
I got Groot.

8592
07:00:32,470 --> 07:00:33,810
I'm coming back.

8593
07:00:34,070 --> 07:00:35,050
I have to reload, I have to reload.

8594
07:00:39,130 --> 07:00:41,150
Jesus Christ, I'm just healing.

8595
07:00:44,850 --> 07:00:47,150
I know, oh my god.

8596
07:00:48,350 --> 07:00:50,450
I'm dead here to... I'm dead.

8597
07:00:55,710 --> 07:00:57,530
We have Mantis ult here.

8598
07:01:00,450 --> 07:01:02,850
We can push from my ult, if anything.

8599
07:01:03,090 --> 07:01:03,330
Alright.

8600
07:01:08,030 --> 07:01:12,170
Okay, can you do an angle again?

8601
07:01:12,310 --> 07:01:13,350
I'm gonna do my turns.

8602
07:01:14,690 --> 07:01:15,670
They're, they're pushing up.

8603
07:01:15,850 --> 07:01:16,130
Behind me.

8604
07:01:17,330 --> 07:01:18,050
I'm on the level.

8605
07:01:21,930 --> 07:01:22,370
Oh.

8606
07:01:26,810 --> 07:01:27,250
Oh.

8607
07:01:27,250 --> 07:01:27,570
Oh.

8608
07:01:29,790 --> 07:01:30,850
I'm jumping in now.

8609
07:01:31,450 --> 07:01:32,670
I'm walled off, I'm walled off.

8610
07:01:34,790 --> 07:01:35,950
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now.

8611
07:01:38,050 --> 07:01:39,230
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting point.

8612
07:01:39,370 --> 07:01:40,130
I'm ulting on point.

8613
07:01:40,830 --> 07:01:41,370
They need heals.

8614
07:01:44,770 --> 07:01:46,830
I'm damage boosting, I'm damage boosting, I'm damage boosting this.

8615
07:01:47,710 --> 07:01:48,330
No more, no more, no more.

8616
07:01:53,290 --> 07:01:53,650
Oh.

8617
07:01:54,390 --> 07:01:56,450
We used both support ults for that fight.

8618
07:01:56,450 --> 07:01:57,450
They still have strange ult, right?

8619
07:01:57,690 --> 07:01:58,570
They have a strange groove.

8620
07:01:58,630 --> 07:01:59,070
No, no, they have a strange groove.

8621
07:01:59,070 --> 07:01:59,970
Oh, you said, okay, okay.

8622
07:02:00,530 --> 07:02:01,750
They have no more Psylocke.

8623
07:02:01,970 --> 07:02:02,850
We need a defensive ult too.

8624
07:02:02,870 --> 07:02:03,830
Hey, there's Loki's ult too.

8625
07:02:05,130 --> 07:02:06,850
Dude, the Psylocke might just solo ult me.

8626
07:02:08,750 --> 07:02:10,450
Psylocke ulted not too long ago, I think.

8627
07:02:10,730 --> 07:02:13,750
Yeah, last time they ulted was two fights ago, where he solo ulted me though.

8628
07:02:13,770 --> 07:02:14,590
Watch out for walls.

8629
07:02:15,050 --> 07:02:17,330
Alright, I'm gonna ult soon, I'm gonna ult soon.

8630
07:02:17,790 --> 07:02:18,250
Get ready, get ready.

8631
07:02:18,530 --> 07:02:20,590
I'm gonna ult in three, two, one, ulting, I think.

8632
07:02:21,310 --> 07:02:23,110
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

8633
07:02:24,370 --> 07:02:25,790
Go, go, go, go.

8634
07:02:25,790 --> 07:02:28,370
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

8635
07:02:28,490 --> 07:02:29,810
You're walled off here.

8636
07:02:29,990 --> 07:02:30,730
You're walled off.

8637
07:02:31,570 --> 07:02:32,930
I have Psylocke too on me.

8638
07:02:37,090 --> 07:02:38,150
Can't kill, bro.

8639
07:02:39,010 --> 07:02:40,990
Groove and Strange were just one-tabbing.

8640
07:02:41,030 --> 07:02:41,970
They just kept on getting healed.

8641
07:02:43,150 --> 07:02:44,290
Yeah, that's true.

8642
07:02:45,270 --> 07:02:48,290
We gotta run before no Stagger is here.

8643
07:02:51,270 --> 07:02:52,530
Oh my god.

8644
07:02:54,930 --> 07:02:59,030
It's not reliable, it's just the Luna tech is not reliable at all.

8645
07:02:59,630 --> 07:03:05,450
It does less healing than you think it does, and it can bug out to where...

8646
07:03:05,450 --> 07:03:07,190
Psylocke has ult, by the way.

8647
07:03:10,230 --> 07:03:11,310
I'm dead here.

8648
07:03:12,610 --> 07:03:13,130
Why?!

8649
07:03:13,130 --> 07:03:15,990
Why don't you ult?!

8650
07:03:17,030 --> 07:03:17,550
What?!

8651
07:03:17,550 --> 07:03:19,250
Our Mantis?!

8652
07:03:19,250 --> 07:03:20,730
Our Mantis was there to gank.

8653
07:03:21,730 --> 07:03:22,730
What?!

8654
07:03:23,450 --> 07:03:25,130
They TP'd.

8655
07:03:25,310 --> 07:03:27,310
We can't get out.

8656
07:03:30,210 --> 07:03:33,170
Oh wait, what?

8657
07:03:35,210 --> 07:03:36,090
I'm here.

8658
07:03:42,150 --> 07:03:44,190
There's a Psylocke behind.

8659
07:03:45,090 --> 07:03:49,970
If you guys live, I can...

8660
07:03:52,110 --> 07:03:55,070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

8661
07:04:02,430 --> 07:04:07,790
Our Mantis threw so many times!

8662
07:04:08,850 --> 07:04:10,750
Oh my god.

8663
07:04:11,370 --> 07:04:12,750
Our Mantis...

8664
07:04:13,590 --> 07:04:16,830
Oh my god, our Mantis was so bad!

8665
07:04:24,540 --> 07:04:26,960
I didn't Q yet.

8666
07:04:27,460 --> 07:04:30,020
Oh my god, I was...

8667
07:04:30,020 --> 07:04:31,380
I don't understand!

8668
07:04:42,840 --> 07:04:46,700
I got solo ulted and then she let me die!

8669
07:04:50,680 --> 07:04:51,680
Twice!

8670
07:04:51,680 --> 07:04:53,320
She did it twice!

8671
07:04:53,980 --> 07:04:55,060
I can't...

8672
07:04:55,060 --> 07:04:56,520
Oh my god.

8673
07:04:57,520 --> 07:05:00,700
Wow, she has a 20% accuracy!

8674
07:05:01,600 --> 07:05:03,720
Alright, I'm looking this guy up.

8675
07:05:04,020 --> 07:05:05,860
I can't, I'm gonna look at your profile.

8676
07:05:06,440 --> 07:05:10,880
I can't.

8677
07:05:11,420 --> 07:05:13,780
Holy shit, that was...

8678
07:05:13,780 --> 07:05:15,010
Oh my god.

8679
07:05:15,840 --> 07:05:18,760
That actually tilted me so hard.

8680
07:05:19,660 --> 07:05:24,560
How do you have a 20% accuracy on fucking Mantis?

8681
07:05:25,060 --> 07:05:26,040
Oh my...

8682
07:05:26,040 --> 07:05:28,520
That's like you're intentionally not hitting anything.

8683
07:05:31,100 --> 07:05:32,220
I can't.

8684
07:05:32,280 --> 07:05:33,100
There's no way.

8685
07:05:33,480 --> 07:05:33,900
You're...

8686
07:05:33,900 --> 07:05:34,840
Wait, what?

8687
07:05:34,960 --> 07:05:35,480
You have a...

8688
07:05:35,480 --> 07:05:35,820
What?

8689
07:05:36,140 --> 07:05:38,080
Is your win rate so high?

8690
07:05:38,340 --> 07:05:39,740
I don't understand!

8691
07:05:40,800 --> 07:05:43,000
What the fuck was that Mantis game?

8692
07:05:43,500 --> 07:05:45,460
What was that Mantis game?

8693
07:05:46,200 --> 07:05:48,740
How is your win rate so high on Mantis?

8694
07:05:55,160 --> 07:05:55,720
I don't understand.

8695
07:05:55,720 --> 07:05:56,560
Oh my god.

8696
07:05:57,340 --> 07:05:58,860
I don't understand.

8697
07:06:00,600 --> 07:06:02,120
How did he get it?

8698
07:06:02,680 --> 07:06:05,380
How did he get so high on that?

8699
07:06:09,960 --> 07:06:11,300
Probably bad game.

8700
07:06:11,460 --> 07:06:13,320
Bro, that was such a bad game from him.

8701
07:06:13,900 --> 07:06:15,780
He literally watched me get...

8702
07:06:15,780 --> 07:06:16,380
He...

8703
07:06:16,380 --> 07:06:17,060
Oh my god.

8704
07:06:17,060 --> 07:06:19,060
He could have saved me from the side.

8705
07:06:19,220 --> 07:06:19,500
Oh my god.

8706
07:06:19,500 --> 07:06:22,640
I don't understand why he didn't save me.

8707
07:06:27,280 --> 07:06:29,960
The fact that he did that twice.

8708
07:06:30,080 --> 07:06:31,020
Oh my god.

8709
07:06:31,060 --> 07:06:32,340
It made me so sad.

8710
07:06:32,440 --> 07:06:33,160
I actually...

8711
07:06:33,160 --> 07:06:36,340
I've never been tilted at another support before.

8712
07:06:36,620 --> 07:06:40,180
It's because I had to see it happen too.

8713
07:06:41,140 --> 07:06:43,360
I'm trying to avoid double support.

8714
07:06:43,360 --> 07:06:46,500
But the fact that to see that happen.

8715
07:06:46,620 --> 07:06:47,720
Oh my god.

8716
07:06:47,780 --> 07:06:49,240
Like, in front of me.

8717
07:06:49,420 --> 07:06:52,340
And then the fact that she didn't heal me.

8718
07:06:52,600 --> 07:06:54,000
When the Nemor was behind.

8719
07:06:54,220 --> 07:06:55,680
Like, when I froze the Nemor.

8720
07:06:56,060 --> 07:06:57,140
She just...

8721
07:06:57,140 --> 07:06:59,320
She let me die.

8722
07:06:59,680 --> 07:07:02,530
I was like, what the fuck?

8723
07:07:03,250 --> 07:07:04,710
Oh my god.

8724
07:07:06,770 --> 07:07:08,150
I did communicate.

8725
07:07:08,450 --> 07:07:10,230
I was like, Mantis ult first.

8726
07:07:10,370 --> 07:07:11,470
Mantis ult first.

8727
07:07:11,710 --> 07:07:13,650
And then she like, waited.

8728
07:07:15,030 --> 07:07:15,630
She...

8729
07:07:15,630 --> 07:07:16,910
She waited.

8730
07:07:18,150 --> 07:07:21,070
I communicated several times.

8731
07:07:22,750 --> 07:07:25,730
And then someone was like, Oh, Timmy has more kills on Luna.

8732
07:07:25,950 --> 07:07:29,510
He has the opportunity to shoot at the team.

8733
07:07:29,950 --> 07:07:30,570
Did you know that?

8734
07:07:31,330 --> 07:07:35,130
People were like, Why don't you DPS more on Luna?

8735
07:07:35,430 --> 07:07:36,870
I wish I could.

8736
07:07:37,030 --> 07:07:38,530
If I had the time.

8737
07:07:38,830 --> 07:07:42,090
If I didn't have to save my fucking team from dying.

8738
07:07:42,090 --> 07:07:43,990
Oh my god.

8739
07:07:45,670 --> 07:07:47,110
I was literally...

8740
07:07:47,110 --> 07:07:49,250
Like, my team was always like, 1 HP.

8741
07:07:50,190 --> 07:07:52,870
Even with like, Snowflake on our other tank.

8742
07:07:56,520 --> 07:07:58,080
I was basically...

8743
07:07:58,080 --> 07:07:59,680
I was like, with my heals.

8744
07:08:00,060 --> 07:08:01,220
For that game.

8745
07:08:03,220 --> 07:08:03,760
It's...

8746
07:08:03,760 --> 07:08:04,940
Oh my god.

8747
07:08:07,120 --> 07:08:07,720
Like...

8748
07:08:10,440 --> 07:08:11,900
Oh my god.

8749
07:08:13,920 --> 07:08:16,000
I had to pick up the heals.

8750
07:08:17,040 --> 07:08:17,820
That's crazy.

8751
07:08:17,960 --> 07:08:20,160
20% on Mantis is actually...

8752
07:08:20,160 --> 07:08:21,140
That's like...

8753
07:08:21,140 --> 07:08:23,500
I've never seen 20% on Mantis before.

8754
07:08:23,660 --> 07:08:25,100
That's actually like...

8755
07:08:25,100 --> 07:08:25,940
An accomplishment.

8756
07:08:26,220 --> 07:08:27,760
I've never seen somebody heal...

8757
07:08:27,760 --> 07:08:29,480
Have a 20% accuracy on her.

8758
07:08:30,340 --> 07:08:31,640
That's actually my first time.

8759
07:08:31,700 --> 07:08:32,940
Like, everybody would have like...

8760
07:08:33,440 --> 07:08:35,100
Like, it would be like...

8761
07:08:35,100 --> 07:08:36,440
30% average.

8762
07:08:36,740 --> 07:08:40,680
I've seen like, the average accuracy is like, 30 to 40%.

8763
07:08:40,680 --> 07:08:42,280
40% of your...

8764
07:08:42,280 --> 07:08:42,840
Of your...

8765
07:08:42,840 --> 07:08:43,180
Oh, here we go.

8766
07:08:43,320 --> 07:08:44,740
See, at least I have 25.

8767
07:08:47,800 --> 07:08:48,960
We lost that though.

8768
07:08:48,960 --> 07:08:50,340
I think that was an EU game too.

8769
07:08:50,400 --> 07:08:51,020
Wait, what's that?

8770
07:08:52,880 --> 07:08:53,800
Oh my god.

8771
07:08:54,560 --> 07:08:55,060
Is this EU?

8772
07:08:55,300 --> 07:08:55,760
This was...

8773
07:08:55,760 --> 07:08:56,480
Yeah, this was EU.

8774
07:08:57,940 --> 07:08:58,800
This was EU.

8775
07:08:59,000 --> 07:08:59,860
Holy shit!

8776
07:08:59,940 --> 07:09:00,160
Wait!

8777
07:09:00,260 --> 07:09:00,960
Wait a minute!

8778
07:09:01,700 --> 07:09:02,000
Wait!

8779
07:09:02,120 --> 07:09:03,620
Oh, now I know why I lost this.

8780
07:09:07,420 --> 07:09:08,620
Wait a minute.

8781
07:09:09,880 --> 07:09:10,920
Wait a minute.

8782
07:09:12,840 --> 07:09:14,440
This was also EU too.

8783
07:09:14,940 --> 07:09:16,180
Yeah, we removed EU.

8784
07:09:16,780 --> 07:09:18,040
We removed EU.

8785
07:09:18,340 --> 07:09:18,940
They were...

8786
07:09:18,940 --> 07:09:20,920
They've had enough of EU games.

8787
07:09:23,800 --> 07:09:26,820
17% is actually wild.

8788
07:09:27,040 --> 07:09:28,060
That's fucking wild.

8789
07:09:30,960 --> 07:09:33,000
I'm checking the receipts now.

8790
07:09:34,320 --> 07:09:36,560
I've never been like...

8791
07:09:36,560 --> 07:09:37,420
Holy shit.

8792
07:09:37,480 --> 07:09:38,960
That's actually crazy.

8793
07:09:39,920 --> 07:09:41,860
That's actually crazy.

8794
07:09:45,080 --> 07:09:46,740
We were in E.

8795
07:09:46,880 --> 07:09:49,160
I never played EUQs before.

8796
07:09:49,600 --> 07:09:52,400
That was my first time playing EUQs.

8797
07:09:54,480 --> 07:09:55,460
I need to like...

8798
07:09:55,460 --> 07:09:57,380
How far off fucking is...

8799
07:09:57,380 --> 07:09:59,480
We're at 113, I think.

8800
07:10:00,140 --> 07:10:00,480
Right?

8801
07:10:00,660 --> 07:10:01,540
Are we at 113?

8802
07:10:02,700 --> 07:10:03,960
Is that where we're at?

8803
07:10:07,260 --> 07:10:10,000
Yeah, we deleted Europe for now.

8804
07:10:11,000 --> 07:10:14,080
I think I'm like stuck at like 100 points.

8805
07:10:15,820 --> 07:10:16,560
At the moment.

8806
07:10:16,780 --> 07:10:18,120
It's been like on and off.

8807
07:10:18,220 --> 07:10:18,700
But like...

8808
07:10:18,700 --> 07:10:21,460
It's not like our stack issue.

8809
07:10:21,860 --> 07:10:23,360
We both like play...

8810
07:10:23,360 --> 07:10:25,440
Like everybody in the stack is playing well.

8811
07:10:25,920 --> 07:10:31,740
It's literally like one or two players that's like not doing their best.

8812
07:10:33,600 --> 07:10:34,480
Oh yeah!

8813
07:10:34,720 --> 07:10:36,420
I remember I asked about the jumping thing.

8814
07:10:36,420 --> 07:10:39,440
Is jumping good in Marvel Rivals or should you avoid jumping?

8815
07:10:39,860 --> 07:10:40,640
When you're...

8816
07:10:40,640 --> 07:10:41,420
When you're...

8817
07:10:43,380 --> 07:10:46,160
Because in Apex, jumping is like more predictable.

8818
07:10:47,100 --> 07:10:47,420
And like...

8819
07:10:48,160 --> 07:10:49,400
So is like...

8820
07:10:49,400 --> 07:10:49,740
I don't know.

8821
07:10:50,040 --> 07:10:50,980
I don't remember in Overwatch.

8822
07:10:51,160 --> 07:10:52,660
I played Lucio in Overwatch.

8823
07:10:52,760 --> 07:10:53,760
So like I jumped a lot.

8824
07:10:54,200 --> 07:10:56,000
Same with like...

8825
07:10:56,000 --> 07:10:58,760
I know like as Ana, I try to avoid jumping.

8826
07:10:59,540 --> 07:11:00,420
I don't know.

8827
07:11:01,860 --> 07:11:04,440
Because I see so many players jumping.

8828
07:11:04,440 --> 07:11:06,320
But I feel like that's such a bad habit.

8829
07:11:07,400 --> 07:11:09,780
Yeah, jumping is like so bad.

8830
07:11:10,000 --> 07:11:10,640
So I don't understand.

8831
07:11:10,800 --> 07:11:15,700
I only jump if I have to like shoot somebody that requires you to jump.

8832
07:11:16,520 --> 07:11:18,160
That's the only reason to jump.

8833
07:11:18,720 --> 07:11:21,500
I don't know any other reason why you would jump at all.

8834
07:11:22,700 --> 07:11:23,500
I see so many...

8835
07:11:23,500 --> 07:11:27,300
I see like people try to jump a lot like that.

8836
07:11:27,420 --> 07:11:29,260
But like it's so bad.

8837
07:11:29,460 --> 07:11:30,560
It makes you so predictable.

8838
07:11:31,900 --> 07:11:33,240
You should just like...

8839
07:11:34,660 --> 07:11:38,320
I understand like crouch spamming, but you can't crouch spam at all.

8840
07:11:42,300 --> 07:11:43,440
Jumping always causes...

8841
07:11:43,440 --> 07:11:45,200
Yeah, like jumping makes you so predictable.

8842
07:11:45,760 --> 07:11:47,700
That's why I try to avoid jumping.

8843
07:11:48,200 --> 07:11:49,200
It's like a little...

8844
07:11:50,400 --> 07:11:54,180
I need to practice like aiming projectile on Mantis.

8845
07:11:55,320 --> 07:11:56,700
Mantis is so hard.

8846
07:11:58,400 --> 07:11:59,760
I do 1v1s here.

8847
07:12:00,260 --> 07:12:01,280
I know you can.

8848
07:12:02,600 --> 07:12:04,280
I do 1v1s.

8849
07:12:08,240 --> 07:12:10,040
I wanna 1v1.

8850
07:12:13,640 --> 07:12:14,120
No!

8851
07:12:18,100 --> 07:12:19,580
I was doing a crouch.

8852
07:12:20,080 --> 07:12:21,020
That's fucked up.

8853
07:12:21,380 --> 07:12:22,200
Oh, he's not gonna make it.

8854
07:12:22,440 --> 07:12:23,280
He's not gonna make it.

8855
07:12:23,480 --> 07:12:24,660
He's not gonna make it.

8856
07:12:24,700 --> 07:12:25,580
I fucking knew it.

8857
07:12:26,580 --> 07:12:27,480
Okay, that's fucked up.

8858
07:12:27,680 --> 07:12:28,280
That's so...

8859
07:12:28,840 --> 07:12:32,700
I can't even do anything!

8860
07:12:33,300 --> 07:12:33,820
Wait, what?

8861
07:12:35,320 --> 07:12:36,520
I was like, what?

8862
07:12:38,800 --> 07:12:40,600
It's like, how is that possible?

8863
07:12:41,380 --> 07:12:42,800
Wait, how do I practice settings?

8864
07:12:43,540 --> 07:12:44,320
There we go.

8865
07:12:46,000 --> 07:12:47,520
Friendly fire enabled.

8866
07:12:47,680 --> 07:12:48,600
There we go.

8867
07:12:50,160 --> 07:12:53,220
Oh, you pussy.

8868
07:12:53,620 --> 07:12:55,220
Oh, you're such a pussy!

8869
07:12:59,900 --> 07:13:00,940
Fuck this.

8870
07:13:11,040 --> 07:13:13,340
Man, it's all the time.

8871
07:13:13,440 --> 07:13:15,340
It's all the time.

8872
07:13:17,220 --> 07:13:18,680
No, shit, no, no.

8873
07:13:18,760 --> 07:13:19,260
That's illegal.

8874
07:13:19,920 --> 07:13:20,600
You're in spawn.

8875
07:13:21,300 --> 07:13:22,500
You're in spawn.

8876
07:13:22,620 --> 07:13:23,260
That's illegal.

8877
07:13:26,760 --> 07:13:28,160
Oh my god.

8878
07:13:28,900 --> 07:13:30,100
That's so...

8879
07:13:30,100 --> 07:13:32,740
Bro, you're taking advantage of spawn.

8880
07:13:33,000 --> 07:13:33,780
You're a bitch.

8881
07:13:33,860 --> 07:13:35,420
You're an actual little bitch.

8882
07:13:36,080 --> 07:13:37,380
You're a little bitch.

8883
07:13:45,960 --> 07:13:47,080
No.

8884
07:13:47,540 --> 07:13:48,360
No cooldowns.

8885
07:13:48,420 --> 07:13:49,340
No ability cooldowns.

8886
07:13:49,440 --> 07:13:50,420
We're...

8887
07:13:50,420 --> 07:13:52,540
No ability cooldowns.

8888
07:13:52,620 --> 07:13:53,600
Alright, we're...

8889
07:13:55,400 --> 07:13:56,600
Oh my god.

8890
07:13:59,160 --> 07:14:00,980
Wait, what?

8891
07:14:01,840 --> 07:14:03,820
Oh, that's so...

8892
07:14:04,580 --> 07:14:06,400
That's actually bullshit.

8893
07:14:09,600 --> 07:14:11,040
He actually bull...

8894
07:14:11,040 --> 07:14:12,420
That was bullshit there.

8895
07:14:12,900 --> 07:14:14,480
That was actually bullshit.

8896
07:14:16,520 --> 07:14:18,600
That was such a sick...

8897
07:14:21,580 --> 07:14:22,200
Oh my god.

8898
07:14:22,220 --> 07:14:22,620
Come on.

8899
07:14:22,760 --> 07:14:23,700
Don't be a little bitch.

8900
07:14:28,580 --> 07:14:30,280
Oh shit, I keep forgetting.

8901
07:14:30,500 --> 07:14:32,440
He fucking just shows up.

8902
07:14:32,820 --> 07:14:33,740
I keep forgetting.

8903
07:14:33,740 --> 07:14:36,740
What the fuck?

8904
07:14:40,370 --> 07:14:41,190
He just...

8905
07:14:41,190 --> 07:14:42,590
He's abusing...

8906
07:14:42,590 --> 07:14:43,690
He has zero cooldowns.

8907
07:14:45,930 --> 07:14:47,510
He turned off cooldowns.

8908
07:14:47,510 --> 07:14:48,190
That's cheating.

8909
07:14:49,510 --> 07:14:52,750
There's no way you can do that without cooldowns.

8910
07:14:53,330 --> 07:14:54,290
That's no way.

8911
07:14:54,910 --> 07:14:57,730
He's actually abusing the no cooldown shit.

8912
07:15:03,510 --> 07:15:05,010
Can't believe it.

8913
07:15:05,010 --> 07:15:06,430
He fucking zero...

8914
07:15:06,430 --> 07:15:08,270
He's zero cooldowning me!

8915
07:15:08,710 --> 07:15:09,650
You're so...

8916
07:15:09,650 --> 07:15:10,790
You're so bad.

8917
07:15:11,110 --> 07:15:11,890
That's looking right.

8918
07:15:15,070 --> 07:15:16,150
Oh my god.

8919
07:15:16,850 --> 07:15:18,310
You're such a little bitch.

8920
07:15:21,050 --> 07:15:22,210
That's looking right.

8921
07:15:22,410 --> 07:15:23,470
That's looking right.

8922
07:15:23,670 --> 07:15:24,290
Don't mess...

8923
07:15:25,750 --> 07:15:26,410
Where is he?

8924
07:15:28,350 --> 07:15:31,190
You think I don't know about the zero cooldown shit you did?

8925
07:15:31,310 --> 07:15:32,650
Oh, you're hiding in spawn?

8926
07:15:32,910 --> 07:15:33,330
Pussy.

8927
07:15:33,330 --> 07:15:33,750
Pussy.

8928
07:15:34,750 --> 07:15:35,310
Oh!

8929
07:15:36,630 --> 07:15:37,710
Oh, fuck.

8930
07:15:38,050 --> 07:15:38,990
Oh, fuck.

8931
07:15:39,230 --> 07:15:40,370
Jack at me and...

8932
07:15:40,370 --> 07:15:48,750
Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

8933
07:15:51,510 --> 07:15:52,150
Oh my god.

8934
07:15:52,550 --> 07:15:53,130
Hide behind.

8935
07:15:53,590 --> 07:15:54,270
Hide behind.

8936
07:15:54,610 --> 07:15:55,610
Hide behind him.

8937
07:15:56,250 --> 07:15:57,310
Hide behind him.

8938
07:15:57,870 --> 07:15:58,490
In the spot.

8939
07:15:59,330 --> 07:16:00,390
Hide behind him.

8940
07:16:00,690 --> 07:16:03,230
Oh, you're such a little bitch.

8941
07:16:06,390 --> 07:16:08,610
So yeah, oh I'm gonna go in there too!

8942
07:16:09,090 --> 07:16:09,490
Get me in there!

8943
07:16:09,630 --> 07:16:10,390
Get me in there!

8944
07:16:14,670 --> 07:16:15,490
It's okay!

8945
07:16:16,090 --> 07:16:17,250
I'm back up the old!

8946
07:16:17,390 --> 07:16:18,350
Get back up the old!

8947
07:16:18,450 --> 07:16:18,590
No!

8948
07:16:20,370 --> 07:16:21,070
That's okay.

8949
07:16:21,970 --> 07:16:22,910
There we go.

8950
07:16:24,430 --> 07:16:25,270
That's okay.

8951
07:16:26,790 --> 07:16:28,090
I got the old again!

8952
07:16:28,470 --> 07:16:29,790
I got my old again!

8953
07:16:29,830 --> 07:16:30,370
I'm fine!

8954
07:16:30,750 --> 07:16:31,930
I'm so healthy!

8955
07:16:33,330 --> 07:16:34,410
I'm so healthy!

8956
07:16:35,230 --> 07:16:37,170
The world came back to my old!

8957
07:16:38,970 --> 07:16:39,650
It's okay!

8958
07:16:39,710 --> 07:16:40,950
I'm still so healthy!

8959
07:16:42,190 --> 07:16:43,830
I'm still so healthy!

8960
07:16:44,810 --> 07:16:45,170
There we go!

8961
07:16:47,870 --> 07:16:50,590
I got it!

8962
07:16:50,770 --> 07:16:51,470
I got it!

8963
07:16:53,990 --> 07:16:55,250
Get me out of here!

8964
07:16:56,470 --> 07:16:57,370
Get me out of here!

8965
07:16:57,430 --> 07:16:57,710
No!

8966
07:16:57,850 --> 07:16:58,950
I get it all the time!

8967
07:17:03,590 --> 07:17:04,330
No!

8968
07:17:04,410 --> 07:17:06,590
Don't make me do this!

8969
07:17:07,370 --> 07:17:08,370
Don't make me do this!

8970
07:17:08,530 --> 07:17:09,110
That's a great!

8971
07:17:14,730 --> 07:17:15,990
That's a great!

8972
07:17:16,750 --> 07:17:17,650
That's a great!

8973
07:17:18,230 --> 07:17:19,890
Now you can't!

8974
07:17:23,030 --> 07:17:24,150
That's a great!

8975
07:17:25,070 --> 07:17:27,110
Now you can't leave!

8976
07:17:28,950 --> 07:17:30,510
You can't leave!

8977
07:17:31,030 --> 07:17:34,290
It's just like Ana all over again!

8978
07:17:35,330 --> 07:17:36,010
That's a great!

8979
07:17:37,610 --> 07:17:40,250
It's a cool guy now!

8980
07:17:41,070 --> 07:17:42,190
That's right!

8981
07:17:43,290 --> 07:17:44,810
No more ults!

8982
07:17:45,110 --> 07:17:47,210
No more ults smash!

8983
07:17:47,770 --> 07:17:49,110
No more!

8984
07:17:50,410 --> 07:17:51,070
That's right!

8985
07:17:51,150 --> 07:17:52,070
You know what would be petty?

8986
07:17:52,310 --> 07:17:52,630
Boom!

8987
07:17:56,130 --> 07:17:57,370
That's a great!

8988
07:17:59,790 --> 07:18:00,690
Oh shit!

8989
07:18:03,030 --> 07:18:03,910
No!

8990
07:18:07,070 --> 07:18:08,170
I fucked up!

8991
07:18:09,230 --> 07:18:10,870
I got too cocky!

8992
07:18:11,310 --> 07:18:13,650
I got way too cocky there!

8993
07:18:15,090 --> 07:18:17,150
Okay, it's one or the other.

8994
07:18:17,670 --> 07:18:18,230
I'm first!

8995
07:18:18,690 --> 07:18:19,290
I'm first!

8996
07:18:19,550 --> 07:18:20,870
I'm first!

8997
07:18:21,210 --> 07:18:22,910
I'm first, bitch!

8998
07:18:23,550 --> 07:18:25,210
I'm first!

8999
07:18:30,510 --> 07:18:32,470
That's a great!

9000
07:18:33,210 --> 07:18:35,250
That's a jack shit now!

9001
07:18:35,930 --> 07:18:37,310
I'm first!

9002
07:18:38,990 --> 07:18:40,350
Easy!

9003
07:18:41,210 --> 07:18:41,890
Easy!

9004
07:18:42,590 --> 07:18:44,530
So fucking easy!

9005
07:18:44,530 --> 07:18:44,690
Easy!

9006
07:18:59,540 --> 07:19:01,120
Oh, you don't like that!

9007
07:19:01,380 --> 07:19:02,320
Don't do you!

9008
07:19:02,480 --> 07:19:03,440
You don't like that!

9009
07:19:03,640 --> 07:19:04,220
Oh shit!

9010
07:19:05,360 --> 07:19:05,940
What are you gonna do?

9011
07:19:06,000 --> 07:19:07,060
You're just gonna dance!

9012
07:19:09,580 --> 07:19:11,580
Octavia, thank you for the red!

9013
07:19:11,720 --> 07:19:12,020
Thank you!

9014
07:19:12,100 --> 07:19:12,260
Thank you!

9015
07:19:12,260 --> 07:19:14,500
Are you enjoying Marvel Rivals 2?

9016
07:19:14,500 --> 07:19:17,780
He's just dancing non-stop!

9017
07:19:18,500 --> 07:19:19,400
Hello everybody!

9018
07:19:19,880 --> 07:19:21,940
My name is Doki Bird.

9019
07:19:22,520 --> 07:19:24,340
I am trying to grind top 5.

9020
07:19:24,460 --> 07:19:27,480
I usually stream on YouTube, but like, we're here.

9021
07:19:29,660 --> 07:19:31,360
You know what?

9022
07:19:31,580 --> 07:19:33,820
What if I wanna dance too?

9023
07:19:36,760 --> 07:19:38,580
I'm ready to put on a show!

9024
07:19:38,960 --> 07:19:39,760
Let's go!

9025
07:19:39,760 --> 07:19:40,660
Woo!

9026
07:19:42,520 --> 07:19:43,900
Let's go!

9027
07:19:44,220 --> 07:19:46,180
We're ready to put on a show!

9028
07:19:47,000 --> 07:19:49,240
Is this Marvel Rivals?

9029
07:19:49,820 --> 07:19:55,200
Is this Marvel Rivals?

9030
07:19:55,920 --> 07:19:59,080
We're ready to put on a show, everybody!

9031
07:19:59,720 --> 07:20:02,000
The girls are grilling right now!

9032
07:20:03,960 --> 07:20:04,920
Let's go!

9033
07:20:05,460 --> 07:20:06,360
Yippee!

9034
07:20:06,700 --> 07:20:07,460
Slay!

9035
07:20:10,460 --> 07:20:11,880
This is Marvel Rivals.

9036
07:20:12,100 --> 07:20:13,780
We're all ready to put on a show.

9037
07:20:14,800 --> 07:20:15,320
Woah!

9038
07:20:16,160 --> 07:20:17,520
I'm ready to put on a show!

9039
07:20:18,520 --> 07:20:20,620
Please give us a fucking game!

9040
07:20:20,720 --> 07:20:21,760
I don't understand!

9041
07:20:22,340 --> 07:20:23,360
Where is our game?

9042
07:20:23,960 --> 07:20:25,420
Where is our fucking game?

9043
07:20:28,720 --> 07:20:31,840
Because I've been in queue for 15 minutes.

9044
07:20:31,840 --> 07:20:35,200
I am ready to put on a show!

9045
07:20:35,720 --> 07:20:36,960
Where is our game?

9046
07:20:37,940 --> 07:20:39,300
Where is our game?

9047
07:20:39,540 --> 07:20:42,400
I'm not even at 200!

9048
07:20:44,720 --> 07:20:45,540
I need EU.

9049
07:20:45,960 --> 07:20:49,700
Are we in EU queues yet?

9050
07:20:50,940 --> 07:20:51,700
Queues?

9051
07:20:56,780 --> 07:21:00,790
This is what you deserve.

9052
07:21:01,230 --> 07:21:03,790
This is what you deserve.

9053
07:21:08,570 --> 07:21:09,550
That's right.

9054
07:21:10,010 --> 07:21:11,690
No gameplay for you now.

9055
07:21:12,330 --> 07:21:14,650
No gameplay for you now.

9056
07:21:15,270 --> 07:21:16,270
That's right.

9057
07:21:17,110 --> 07:21:18,190
You don't get to play.

9058
07:21:18,630 --> 07:21:20,690
You don't fucking get to play.

9059
07:21:21,450 --> 07:21:24,970
You don't get to play video games after that!

9060
07:21:29,270 --> 07:21:30,150
That's right.

9061
07:21:30,770 --> 07:21:32,190
That's right.

9062
07:21:38,330 --> 07:21:40,330
That's right.

9063
07:21:42,270 --> 07:21:43,690
That's fucking right.

9064
07:21:43,970 --> 07:21:45,990
Nothing can save you.

9065
07:21:46,610 --> 07:21:48,650
Nothing can save you.

9066
07:21:50,450 --> 07:21:51,370
Oh shit.

9067
07:21:51,510 --> 07:21:52,430
Oh he's gone.

9068
07:21:54,210 --> 07:21:56,430
He's gone forever.

9069
07:21:57,010 --> 07:21:58,590
Oh shit we got a game!

9070
07:21:59,030 --> 07:22:00,270
That was so fast!

9071
07:22:03,750 --> 07:22:05,150
That was so fast.

9072
07:22:07,550 --> 07:22:09,550
Are we in EU or NA?

9073
07:22:10,410 --> 07:22:11,590
I think this is EU right?

9074
07:22:12,310 --> 07:22:14,370
Oh yeah it's EU with my one ping guys.

9075
07:22:18,650 --> 07:22:22,030
It's EU with my one ping everybody.

9076
07:22:28,710 --> 07:22:31,610
Are we banning Hawkeye?

9077
07:22:32,170 --> 07:22:32,170

07:23:07,750 --> 07:23:11,250

07:23:20,830 --> 07:23:23,350
What is this team comp?

9087
07:23:31,190 --> 07:23:32,630
I don't get this vibe.

9088
07:23:44,690 --> 07:23:46,310
Because it's funnier.

9089
07:23:48,510 --> 07:23:49,390

9090
07:23:49,390 --> 07:23:51,150

No no I'm just a fan of her.

9095
07:24:13,690 --> 07:24:16,770
I took the name before she could take it.

9096
07:24:22,510 --> 07:24:28,230
Wait if somebody stole my name before they stole your name does that mean my fans are more dedicated?

9097
07:24:29,970 --> 07:24:32,810
No no I'm her fan that's why I took the name.

9098
07:24:33,770 --> 07:24:34,790
You took my name?

9099
07:24:35,130 --> 07:24:38,690

I'm a really good impersonator.

9105
07:25:05,630 --> 07:25:06,970

07:25:22,000 --> 07:25:23,020
Hulk is low, Hulk is one.

9110
07:25:25,880 --> 07:25:26,960
I woke you up.

9111
07:25:27,220 --> 07:25:28,160

07:25:36,520 --> 07:25:37,080

07:25:37,080 --> 07:25:38,220
I got him, I got him, I got him.

9116
07:25:38,660 --> 07:25:39,820
I froze him, I froze him, I froze him.

9117
07:25:40,880 --> 07:25:41,920
He's low, he's so low.

9118
07:25:43,880 --> 07:25:44,600
That's fine, that's fine.

9119
07:25:50,420 --> 07:25:52,780

9120
07:25:53,260 --> 07:25:55,360

07:25:55,560 --> 07:25:56,900
Oh double supported.

9122
07:25:57,600 --> 07:25:59,080

07:26:04,580 --> 07:26:07,780
I bubble you.

9124
07:26:08,040 --> 07:26:09,240

9125
07:26:09,360 --> 07:26:09,680

9126
07:26:09,680 --> 07:26:12,240
There is banner, there is banner.

9127
07:26:13,080 --> 07:26:14,500
I'm asleep, I'm asleep, I'm asleep.

9128
07:26:21,840 --> 07:26:23,060
Oh my god.

9129
07:26:23,640 --> 07:26:24,760
This is a little difficult.

9130
07:26:27,180 --> 07:26:29,440
I didn't realize the Mantis gonna ult there.

9131
07:26:31,700 --> 07:26:33,460
Cause I had Iron Fist on me.

9132
07:26:35,420 --> 07:26:37,940
Oh I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try so hard now.

9133
07:26:41,240 --> 07:26:43,060
I got me, I got me, I got me.

9134
07:26:43,220 --> 07:26:44,480
There's a Hulk on me.

9135
07:26:49,840 --> 07:26:52,060
I need heals here.

9136
07:26:54,060 --> 07:26:55,120
I need heals.

9137
07:26:56,660 --> 07:26:58,160
Oh my god.

9138
07:26:59,860 --> 07:27:00,900
I'm not ulting this.

9139
07:27:01,520 --> 07:27:01,960
I'm dying.

9140
07:27:05,620 --> 07:27:06,540
Holy shit.

9141
07:27:11,680 --> 07:27:14,280
I've never played the bar.

9142
07:27:17,960 --> 07:27:19,960
Oh no, yeah this is rough.

9143
07:27:20,600 --> 07:27:22,360
It's rough because like, uh...

9144
07:27:24,440 --> 07:27:26,240
We need, we need like, heal.

9145
07:27:27,940 --> 07:27:35,220
I'm trying, uh, I wanna orb the Iron man, but like, it doesn't matter.

9146
07:27:35,800 --> 07:27:38,620
He gets, he gets deleted so fast.

9147
07:27:40,640 --> 07:27:41,420
Yeah, alright.

9148
07:27:41,660 --> 07:27:44,720
Uh, we can do Mantis ult first so I don't overlap with yours.

9149
07:27:50,600 --> 07:27:52,820
Yeah, that's why you press Q first.

9150
07:27:53,300 --> 07:27:54,140
She pressed Q too.

9151
07:27:56,080 --> 07:27:57,140
I'm gonna try to grab the Iron man.

9152
07:27:58,960 --> 07:27:59,400
Alright.

9153
07:28:04,600 --> 07:28:07,000
We just need like, we just need heal.

9154
07:28:07,220 --> 07:28:08,020
That's really it.

9155
07:28:08,620 --> 07:28:09,640
We're TPing?

9156
07:28:10,180 --> 07:28:12,540
You guys are TPing by the way.

9157
07:28:13,140 --> 07:28:14,260
We're TPing?

9158
07:28:14,260 --> 07:28:16,080
We're TPing?

9159
07:28:16,220 --> 07:28:20,700
I'm just gonna stay here for now.

9160
07:28:24,340 --> 07:28:25,160
What the?

9161
07:28:27,800 --> 07:28:30,180
I have Iron Fist on me.

9162
07:28:32,120 --> 07:28:35,040
Oh, I just have...

9163
07:28:35,040 --> 07:28:36,240
I saw her, yeah.

9164
07:28:38,620 --> 07:28:39,560
That's unlucky.

9165
07:28:42,820 --> 07:28:45,880
I need some peel.

9166
07:28:47,520 --> 07:28:48,560
Peel.

9167
07:28:51,320 --> 07:28:52,360
Peel.

9168
07:28:57,620 --> 07:28:58,660
Peel.

9169
07:28:59,040 --> 07:29:01,020
There's an Iron Fist on our Lute Mantis.

9170
07:29:05,520 --> 07:29:07,140
Iron Fist again.

9171
07:29:09,560 --> 07:29:10,460
Iron Fist one.

9172
07:29:12,260 --> 07:29:13,400
Are we right side?

9173
07:29:13,400 --> 07:29:14,040
Can we go right side?

9174
07:29:15,200 --> 07:29:16,620
No sleep, no sleep.

9175
07:29:19,640 --> 07:29:20,980
Mantis is here, Mantis is here.

9176
07:29:23,100 --> 07:29:25,400
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

9177
07:29:26,760 --> 07:29:27,900
Mantis, Mantis, Mantis.

9178
07:29:32,240 --> 07:29:33,960
I have Hulk on me, I have Hulk on me.

9179
07:29:34,540 --> 07:29:35,780
I'm ulting this now.

9180
07:29:38,540 --> 07:29:39,140
Nice, nice.

9181
07:29:39,160 --> 07:29:40,180
I'm on damage, I'm on damage.

9182
07:29:40,180 --> 07:29:42,400
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk low.

9183
07:29:43,400 --> 07:29:44,460
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

9184
07:29:45,040 --> 07:29:45,800
Just kill him, just kill him.

9185
07:29:45,960 --> 07:29:46,140
I'm coming.

9186
07:29:46,300 --> 07:29:47,480
I don't have Heal Spore, I don't have Heal Spore.

9187
07:29:49,560 --> 07:29:50,320
I have Hulk on me.

9188
07:29:50,740 --> 07:29:51,660
Heal Hulk, Hulk, Heal Hulk.

9189
07:29:53,180 --> 07:29:53,940
Hulk one, Hulk one.

9190
07:29:54,660 --> 07:29:55,400
You got that, you got that.

9191
07:29:55,520 --> 07:29:55,940
Yeah, we got it, we got it.

9192
07:29:57,360 --> 07:29:58,280
Help over, help him.

9193
07:29:59,640 --> 07:29:59,940
I got him.

9194
07:30:01,460 --> 07:30:02,000
I'm on his head.

9195
07:30:02,580 --> 07:30:03,680
I'm trying to help you, Mantis.

9196
07:30:03,860 --> 07:30:04,100
Got him.

9197
07:30:04,220 --> 07:30:04,520
Nice, nice.

9198
07:30:04,700 --> 07:30:05,440
Thank you, thank you.

9199
07:30:05,700 --> 07:30:07,100
Mantis, I have Iron Fist looking for you guys now.

9200
07:30:07,360 --> 07:30:07,780
Watch out.

9201
07:30:09,020 --> 07:30:10,720
I'm trying to sleep him after he shoots.

9202
07:30:11,160 --> 07:30:12,040
Maybe you can kill him.

9203
07:30:14,620 --> 07:30:15,880
I need a little bit of Heal, Mantis.

9204
07:30:17,600 --> 07:30:18,120
Thank you.

9205
07:30:18,700 --> 07:30:19,220
He's up, he's up.

9206
07:30:20,700 --> 07:30:21,360
Left side, left side.

9207
07:30:22,060 --> 07:30:23,020
I see him, yeah.

9208
07:30:24,560 --> 07:30:26,460
He's gonna most likely push me.

9209
07:30:28,480 --> 07:30:29,440
I can't heal you.

9210
07:30:29,640 --> 07:30:30,220
I can't heal you.

9211
07:30:30,320 --> 07:30:31,180
I got you, I got you, I got you.

9212
07:30:33,060 --> 07:30:33,840
I grabbed him.

9213
07:30:34,720 --> 07:30:35,000
Nice.

9214
07:30:35,280 --> 07:30:35,940
Man, you don't have?

9215
07:30:38,420 --> 07:30:39,400
I'm face, I'm face, I'm face.

9216
07:30:39,500 --> 07:30:40,600
Can you kill Mantis off the hook maybe?

9217
07:30:42,480 --> 07:30:44,160
I broke... oh no, they woke me.

9218
07:30:44,160 --> 07:30:44,820
I'm on you, I'm on you.

9219
07:30:45,560 --> 07:30:46,920
I'm trying to help you, Mantis.

9220
07:30:47,440 --> 07:30:48,660
I got you, I got you, I got you.

9221
07:30:51,340 --> 07:30:53,180
Mantis, Iron Fist on me, Iron Fist on me.

9222
07:30:55,300 --> 07:30:56,320
Iron Fist still on me.

9223
07:30:57,760 --> 07:30:58,960
I'm on you, I'm on you, I'm on you.

9224
07:30:59,080 --> 07:30:59,780
I'm only healing you.

9225
07:31:00,020 --> 07:31:00,460
Thank you.

9226
07:31:02,860 --> 07:31:03,480
I got you.

9227
07:31:03,600 --> 07:31:04,500
Oh, I'm asleep now.

9228
07:31:05,620 --> 07:31:06,380
You can sleep with Heals.

9229
07:31:06,600 --> 07:31:07,260
You're fine, you're fine.

9230
07:31:07,920 --> 07:31:10,500
Look at Iron Man, look at Iron Man.

9231
07:31:13,390 --> 07:31:15,090
I have ult in 10, I have ult in 10.

9232
07:31:18,430 --> 07:31:19,770
I hear an Iron Fist behind.

9233
07:31:20,510 --> 07:31:21,510
Iron Fist 1, Iron Fist 1.

9234
07:31:25,070 --> 07:31:25,830
I have to reload.

9235
07:31:29,410 --> 07:31:30,390
Oh, that's unlucky.

9236
07:31:32,170 --> 07:31:35,450
I have to reload, I have to reload.

9237
07:31:39,370 --> 07:31:41,350
I froze Hulk, nice.

9238
07:31:43,490 --> 07:31:45,510
I have ult for you.

9239
07:31:52,430 --> 07:31:52,890
3,

9240
07:31:56,490 --> 07:31:57,390
2, 1.

9241
07:31:57,830 --> 07:32:00,490
I froze Iron Fist, I froze Iron Fist.

9242
07:32:02,390 --> 07:32:03,930
Iron Fist is low, Iron Fist is 1.

9243
07:32:04,150 --> 07:32:05,190
I'm dead, I'm dead though.

9244
07:32:08,750 --> 07:32:12,310
Look at Hulk, Hulk 1.

9245
07:32:13,330 --> 07:32:14,010
I'm dead though.

9246
07:32:17,490 --> 07:32:18,930
I'm going back now.

9247
07:32:24,550 --> 07:32:26,150
Oh my god.

9248
07:32:28,290 --> 07:32:30,650
They used, I don't know if they used Luna.

9249
07:32:31,310 --> 07:32:32,370
I don't remember.

9250
07:32:32,710 --> 07:32:34,590
They did, they did.

9251
07:32:34,590 --> 07:32:35,170
They did, okay.

9252
07:32:35,430 --> 07:32:36,410
I was in the back line.

9253
07:32:36,410 --> 07:32:40,530
I waited for her to leave, grabbed her, killed her.

9254
07:32:40,770 --> 07:32:41,290
Hold me baby.

9255
07:32:42,250 --> 07:32:43,110
Damn, all you.

9256
07:32:44,850 --> 07:32:46,250
I won't say, 0 deaths.

9257
07:32:47,010 --> 07:32:50,130
I feel like I was matting this match, they're just going on back line all game.

9258
07:32:50,710 --> 07:32:53,290
Yeah, listen, Wolver, you're my goat, you're fighting demons there.

9259
07:32:53,970 --> 07:32:54,870
You're fighting demons.

9260
07:32:54,890 --> 07:32:57,450
I'm getting a fucking headache, I need to flick like back and forth all day.

9261
07:32:57,450 --> 07:33:03,010
Listen guys, listen, keep flicking, keep getting a headache, just let me pop off, let me eat you.

9262
07:33:03,030 --> 07:33:04,210
Yeah, you cook, you cook I guess.

9263
07:33:04,530 --> 07:33:05,570
I cook, I cook.

9264
07:33:06,430 --> 07:33:10,190
Oh my god, my mantis peeled for me.

9265
07:33:10,870 --> 07:33:14,590
She held my hand, I'm so happy.

9266
07:33:17,690 --> 07:33:19,670
I'm so happy.

9267
07:33:24,570 --> 07:33:27,810
I'm so happy, what the fuck, I love it.

9268
07:33:28,430 --> 07:33:29,230
It's baseball time.

9269
07:33:30,490 --> 07:33:32,310
It's baseball time.

9270
07:33:36,410 --> 07:33:38,570
Okay, now, now, now, now.

9271
07:33:49,970 --> 07:33:52,070
That's crazy.

9272
07:33:58,070 --> 07:34:03,870
Oh my god, that...

9273
07:34:04,870 --> 07:34:09,310
Oh my god, she like died through her ult, that's crazy.

9274
07:34:09,750 --> 07:34:12,270
I don't know how she died through her ult.

9275
07:34:15,350 --> 07:34:18,150
Okay, you can do it.

9276
07:34:23,770 --> 07:34:28,630
Iron Fist behind us.

9277
07:34:29,310 --> 07:34:30,250
I frozen my Frozen Veil.

9278
07:34:33,870 --> 07:34:37,790
Oh my god, I got, I got, there's a Hulk behind us.

9279
07:34:40,110 --> 07:34:42,370
Where did he come from, what?

9280
07:34:43,250 --> 07:34:45,130
I didn't even see that.

9281
07:34:47,850 --> 07:34:48,490
You're down, Luna.

9282
07:34:52,750 --> 07:34:54,230
I'm coming back, I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

9283
07:34:54,950 --> 07:34:56,050
Nice, nice, cap point, cap point.

9284
07:34:56,710 --> 07:34:57,810
It's fine, it's fine, they have no supports.

9285
07:34:58,030 --> 07:34:59,610
Don't die, don't die, don't die.

9286
07:35:00,310 --> 07:35:01,170
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

9287
07:35:02,030 --> 07:35:03,370
Iron can die.

9288
07:35:08,550 --> 07:35:10,590
I don't see Iron Man for heals.

9289
07:35:10,990 --> 07:35:11,650
I got you, I got you now.

9290
07:35:14,310 --> 07:35:15,930
Oh my god.

9291
07:35:22,950 --> 07:35:25,530
I'm just gonna mirror their Luna.

9292
07:35:31,490 --> 07:35:32,450
He's looking on the right wall.

9293
07:35:35,250 --> 07:35:36,790
I have Frozen, I have Frozen, I have Frozen.

9294
07:35:38,450 --> 07:35:40,610
I have Hulk right behind me.

9295
07:35:45,090 --> 07:35:46,690
I'll ult after this, I'm gonna ult after this.

9296
07:35:49,350 --> 07:35:51,150
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting on point, I'm ulting on point.

9297
07:35:53,230 --> 07:35:54,550
I'm going to their Strange, I'm going to their Strange.

9298
07:35:58,370 --> 07:36:00,510
Iron Fist, Iron Fist, Iron Fist.

9299
07:36:02,270 --> 07:36:03,710
Okay, I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

9300
07:36:03,890 --> 07:36:05,250
Hulk behind you, Hulk behind you.

9301
07:36:17,250 --> 07:36:20,510
They also have Iron Fist, Iron Fist to the right, Iron Fist to the right.

9302
07:36:27,050 --> 07:36:27,770
I'm reloading.

9303
07:36:32,070 --> 07:36:33,770
I slept, I slept, I froze.

9304
07:36:33,910 --> 07:36:36,490
I couldn't do anything for you.

9305
07:36:37,530 --> 07:36:38,890
I'm on point, I'm on point.

9306
07:36:42,010 --> 07:36:43,410
Oh my god.

9307
07:36:44,230 --> 07:36:46,130
I tried my best to heal him.

9308
07:36:47,330 --> 07:36:49,410
He just beats me up in the back.

9309
07:36:53,750 --> 07:36:57,410
All he does is beat me up in the back.

9310
07:36:57,570 --> 07:36:59,050
That's all he does.

9311
07:37:01,170 --> 07:37:03,190
I'm like in the air.

9312
07:37:13,820 --> 07:37:14,620
Hike maybe?

9313
07:37:15,420 --> 07:37:15,860
Hulk low.

9314
07:37:18,300 --> 07:37:19,480
Hulk out, he's low, he's low.

9315
07:37:20,200 --> 07:37:21,200
Iron Fist, Iron Fist.

9316
07:37:22,200 --> 07:37:22,960
Dead, dead, dead.

9317
07:37:24,680 --> 07:37:25,800
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

9318
07:37:26,480 --> 07:37:27,980
I got, I got froze off.

9319
07:37:27,980 --> 07:37:29,840
No, no, no, no, no, no.

9320
07:37:31,440 --> 07:37:32,600
Iron Man's half.

9321
07:37:33,040 --> 07:37:34,400
I'm so low, I'm really low.

9322
07:37:34,800 --> 07:37:36,740
Magneto's alcohol is not coming to me.

9323
07:37:39,580 --> 07:37:40,700
Luna's low, Luna's low.

9324
07:37:41,280 --> 07:37:42,240
Support's coming in.

9325
07:37:46,480 --> 07:37:49,640
I'm coming back now, I'm coming back.

9326
07:37:52,160 --> 07:37:53,380
I can get all here.

9327
07:37:53,900 --> 07:37:55,100
They might TP, they might TP.

9328
07:37:57,220 --> 07:37:59,340
They're TPing, they're TPing, they're TPing.

9329
07:38:01,720 --> 07:38:02,660
Keep me up, keep me up.

9330
07:38:03,140 --> 07:38:04,400
I'm 98, 98, 98.

9331
07:38:04,720 --> 07:38:05,800
I got it, I got it, I got it.

9332
07:38:06,020 --> 07:38:07,120
I'm on point, I'm on point, I'm on point.

9333
07:38:13,620 --> 07:38:17,340
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

9334
07:38:18,680 --> 07:38:19,620
I have Iron Fist on me.

9335
07:38:22,640 --> 07:38:24,020
Oh, there's Iron Man.

9336
07:38:27,300 --> 07:38:27,820
No.

9337
07:38:34,080 --> 07:38:36,340
Oh my god.

9338
07:38:38,580 --> 07:38:41,220
Me, Iron Fist is just, I had nobody.

9339
07:38:41,500 --> 07:38:42,280
Oh my god.

9340
07:38:43,900 --> 07:38:47,220
Clearly, Iron Fist and Hulk were just on me 24-7.

9341
07:38:50,440 --> 07:38:51,840
No, it wasn't too early.

9342
07:38:52,080 --> 07:38:53,220
I had to ult there.

9343
07:38:55,100 --> 07:38:57,340
They were, all of them were like running at me.

9344
07:38:58,540 --> 07:39:04,320
I had to ult because I had Iron Fist and Hulk literally running at me.

9345
07:39:04,460 --> 07:39:07,920
And if I didn't ult there, I would have died.

9346
07:39:08,000 --> 07:39:11,100
Because Iron Fist and Hulk were both, were both...

9347
07:39:13,900 --> 07:39:14,380
Yeah.

9348
07:39:18,190 --> 07:39:19,830
The team needed to kill Iron Fist.

9349
07:39:19,950 --> 07:39:22,510
Our Iron Man got grabbed by Hulk on the high ground.

9350
07:39:22,910 --> 07:39:24,310
So like, I couldn't heal that.

9351
07:39:26,750 --> 07:39:30,970
Yeah, we, the Mantis and I had to peel for each other the entire time.

9352
07:39:31,290 --> 07:39:37,210
But like, we can't peel for each other if Iron Fist and Hulk were on each other.

9353
07:39:41,210 --> 07:39:44,790
If our Iron Man didn't get grabbed there, we would have been fine.

9354
07:39:44,890 --> 07:39:46,750
I think our Iron Man was the weakest link there.

9355
07:39:48,210 --> 07:39:50,170
Our Iron Man was the...

9356
07:39:50,990 --> 07:39:55,410
Because like, he kept getting, he was like, he got out Iron Man.

9357
07:39:57,330 --> 07:40:00,070
I even, I had Orb on him on everything too.

9358
07:40:00,610 --> 07:40:04,470
He had caught, like, he had 24-7 Snowflake.

9359
07:40:06,350 --> 07:40:11,490
And, but like, the enemy, the other Iron Man, uh, Craggy just like out-beamed him.

9360
07:40:15,820 --> 07:40:16,300
Yeah.

9361
07:40:22,660 --> 07:40:24,260
There's nothing we could do there.

9362
07:40:26,520 --> 07:40:29,720
I even tried to have, like, my deaths weren't even that bad too.

9363
07:40:30,780 --> 07:40:38,580
I think the only issue was that it was hard for, it was hard for us to heal because we were, we didn't have a lot of peel.

9364
07:40:39,340 --> 07:40:42,440
We didn't have, like, uh, a lot of peel at all.

9365
07:40:46,100 --> 07:40:51,440
I tried my best to heal Iron Man as much as I can, but it was just too, it was too much.

9366
07:40:52,800 --> 07:40:54,980
If someone did less Overwatch, I don't know.

9367
07:40:55,120 --> 07:40:57,700
I feel like, I like this game because I like Overwatch.

9368
07:41:01,560 --> 07:41:02,680
I don't know.

9369
07:41:02,900 --> 07:41:03,420
I don't know.

9370
07:41:03,500 --> 07:41:03,880
Oh, wait.

9371
07:41:03,960 --> 07:41:04,880
Okay, we got a game.

9372
07:41:05,460 --> 07:41:11,600
I legitimately don't know if you like this game and you don't like Overwatch because this is, like, Overwatch coded.

9373
07:41:15,040 --> 07:41:17,080
It's Overwatch coded, so I don't know.

9374
07:41:20,830 --> 07:41:23,130
I love this game, but only because I love Overwatch.

9375
07:41:24,090 --> 07:41:24,490
Hello.

9376
07:41:26,130 --> 07:41:29,350
Hello, guys.

9377
07:41:30,310 --> 07:41:31,450
Hello, two gamers.

9378
07:41:32,070 --> 07:41:32,750
Hello, hello.

9379
07:41:34,070 --> 07:41:35,750
Yeah, we ban Druid against that guy.

9380
07:41:37,570 --> 07:41:40,690
Get this guy out of here.

9381
07:41:40,930 --> 07:41:42,170
Yeah, get him out of my fucking video game.

9382
07:41:44,750 --> 07:41:45,730
Get him out!

9383
07:41:47,630 --> 07:41:48,890
Get him out!

9384
07:41:49,530 --> 07:41:52,130
I think the Marvel Rivals skins are better than the Overwatch skins.

9385
07:41:52,650 --> 07:41:57,910
Only because it's, like, the reason why is just because, like, Marvel Rivals has, like, I get that.

9386
07:41:57,910 --> 07:41:59,650
It's, like, they have the reference.

9387
07:42:00,290 --> 07:42:02,470
You know, they're, like, I understand that reference.

9388
07:42:02,630 --> 07:42:03,570
I like the skin more.

9389
07:42:08,740 --> 07:42:09,720
That's really it.

9390
07:42:10,860 --> 07:42:12,480
They're just, like, I know that skin.

9391
07:42:14,620 --> 07:42:14,980
Come.

9392
07:42:15,340 --> 07:42:16,140
Thank you for the biddies.

9393
07:42:16,260 --> 07:42:16,860
Thank you, thank you.

9394
07:42:16,880 --> 07:42:17,880
I'm not top 500.

9395
07:42:18,160 --> 07:42:20,160
I need four wins.

9396
07:42:20,240 --> 07:42:20,980
Four to five wins.

9397
07:42:21,080 --> 07:42:22,000
Two, four, six, eight.

9398
07:42:22,100 --> 07:42:23,440
Yeah, I need, like, four wins.

9399
07:42:24,240 --> 07:42:25,580
They have a Hulk player, though.

9400
07:42:25,580 --> 07:42:28,280
Life energy is a powerful weapon against evil.

9401
07:42:28,800 --> 07:42:33,700
Am I not tired?

9402
07:42:34,200 --> 07:42:35,320
Pure fucking adrenaline.

9403
07:42:36,180 --> 07:42:41,040
Not gonna lie, it's legitimately... legitimately just pure fucking adrenaline.

9404
07:42:42,600 --> 07:42:44,480
And my need to be top 500.

9405
07:42:45,350 --> 07:42:52,720
Guys, I don't want to take five days to get... Guys, if I get there early, I can stream other things.

9406
07:42:52,720 --> 07:42:55,820
I can go back to my YouTube channel.

9407
07:42:58,080 --> 07:42:59,000
I'm on one.

9408
07:42:59,120 --> 07:43:05,500
I just drink... Every time I fucking play my rival, stream my rivals, I just drink one cup.

9409
07:43:05,640 --> 07:43:08,100
One cup of Gamersubs.

9410
07:43:12,140 --> 07:43:13,100
Oh my god.

9411
07:43:13,360 --> 07:43:16,580
We've been, like, at least we're... Games have been fun, though.

9412
07:43:16,880 --> 07:43:18,160
I enjoyed the games we had.

9413
07:43:18,240 --> 07:43:19,680
Except for that fucking Mantis game.

9414
07:43:19,780 --> 07:43:20,940
No, fuck that Mantis player.

9415
07:43:21,260 --> 07:43:21,540
Honestly.

9416
07:43:21,540 --> 07:43:25,420
I liked every game except for that goddamn Mantis player that we had.

9417
07:43:28,760 --> 07:43:30,260
We need a Grinding to keep it.

9418
07:43:30,380 --> 07:43:35,320
No, Decay... I think Decay is, like, once... I think Decay happens within a week.

9419
07:43:35,760 --> 07:43:39,240
Because I didn't play for three days, and I still had... I didn't drop any.

9420
07:43:40,160 --> 07:43:41,000
I didn't drop any.

9421
07:43:41,700 --> 07:43:47,580
So I legitimately think it's just... I think it's, like, a week or something like other games.

9422
07:43:48,700 --> 07:43:51,020
Other games are a week, so I think that's really it.

9423
07:43:55,060 --> 07:43:55,420
Woop.

9424
07:43:55,420 --> 07:43:55,780
Woop.

9425
07:44:05,940 --> 07:44:10,340
Oh, they have Hawkeye.

9426
07:44:10,420 --> 07:44:11,480
Wait, we didn't ban Hawkeye?

9427
07:44:12,060 --> 07:44:13,720
Oh my god, I didn't pay attention.

9428
07:44:13,840 --> 07:44:14,560
I didn't realize we...

9429
07:44:16,880 --> 07:44:18,340
I did not... Oh, you guys are very low.

9430
07:44:22,190 --> 07:44:22,780
I'm fine.

9431
07:44:26,200 --> 07:44:29,260
Yeah, they...

9432
07:44:29,260 --> 07:44:32,420
You only have... Careful, I don't have...

9433
07:44:33,540 --> 07:44:34,620
I'm on Strange.

9434
07:44:34,820 --> 07:44:35,260
I'm on Strange.

9435
07:44:39,640 --> 07:44:41,360
What happened?

9436
07:44:46,360 --> 07:44:48,080
What happened?

9437
07:44:48,080 --> 07:44:48,140
What happened?

9438
07:44:50,760 --> 07:44:53,000
I don't even know what happened.

9439
07:44:57,380 --> 07:45:01,140
TP, TP behind them, guys!

9440
07:45:04,900 --> 07:45:08,380
I have my Mantis ult, but I don't think I should use it yet.

9441
07:45:08,380 --> 07:45:11,500
Hide, hide, hide.

9442
07:45:11,620 --> 07:45:12,200
I'm freezing down.

9443
07:45:15,760 --> 07:45:16,660
Strange is to our left.

9444
07:45:16,740 --> 07:45:17,360
Strange is to our left.

9445
07:45:18,280 --> 07:45:19,380
I'm ulting you for this.

9446
07:45:20,580 --> 07:45:20,980
Yeah.

9447
07:45:23,460 --> 07:45:24,920
We should be able to go up.

9448
07:45:25,960 --> 07:45:26,760
Oh, he...

9449
07:45:29,780 --> 07:45:31,620
I can heal you guys from up there.

9450
07:45:34,120 --> 07:45:35,940
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

9451
07:45:36,400 --> 07:45:37,460
I'm damage boosting you.

9452
07:45:37,460 --> 07:45:38,680
Bro, I'm going in then.

9453
07:45:40,920 --> 07:45:42,440
I don't see you guys up there.

9454
07:45:46,280 --> 07:45:50,320
I have no leaves, I have no leaves, I have no leaves.

9455
07:45:52,420 --> 07:45:55,300
Get this guy, get this guy.

9456
07:45:57,240 --> 07:45:59,160
Point, point.

9457
07:45:59,980 --> 07:46:01,220
Yeah, we got it, we got it.

9458
07:46:02,640 --> 07:46:03,320
I'm looking, I'm looking.

9459
07:46:04,420 --> 07:46:05,220
I'm gonna look on the right.

9460
07:46:06,340 --> 07:46:07,320
I'm trying to get to you.

9461
07:46:11,820 --> 07:46:12,900
I got you, I got you.

9462
07:46:14,260 --> 07:46:15,300
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting them all.

9463
07:46:19,980 --> 07:46:20,860
I got them all.

9464
07:46:24,640 --> 07:46:25,320
That's it, that's it.

9465
07:46:26,760 --> 07:46:27,520
Strange, Strange, Strange.

9466
07:46:28,620 --> 07:46:29,280
I have to reload.

9467
07:46:33,840 --> 07:46:34,960
I slept Strange.

9468
07:46:35,980 --> 07:46:37,040
Wait, I have all here.

9469
07:46:37,140 --> 07:46:37,580
Is it winnable?

9470
07:46:38,720 --> 07:46:39,540
No, no, no, no.

9471
07:46:39,540 --> 07:46:39,800
No?

9472
07:46:39,900 --> 07:46:40,600
Okay, I'll keep it then.

9473
07:46:46,590 --> 07:46:47,390
One ping.

9474
07:46:47,570 --> 07:46:49,230
That's right, I have one ping.

9475
07:46:52,750 --> 07:46:54,030
I still have Hawkeye up.

9476
07:47:01,510 --> 07:47:02,850
I can't see you.

9477
07:47:05,050 --> 07:47:05,630
One ping.

9478
07:47:11,350 --> 07:47:12,510
I'm not ulting yet.

9479
07:47:19,510 --> 07:47:21,410
I can give you damage boost.

9480
07:47:25,070 --> 07:47:25,810
He's one, he's one.

9481
07:47:25,850 --> 07:47:26,790
I got him, I got him, I got him.

9482
07:47:28,930 --> 07:47:29,570
I'm ulting.

9483
07:47:29,730 --> 07:47:31,070
I got my ult up, I got my ult up.

9484
07:47:35,370 --> 07:47:37,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9485
07:47:38,090 --> 07:47:39,510
We're even right now.

9486
07:47:40,010 --> 07:47:42,530
I got damage boost on you.

9487
07:47:44,650 --> 07:47:45,790
I'm not peeking this.

9488
07:47:46,790 --> 07:47:48,170
I am not peeking that either.

9489
07:47:48,570 --> 07:47:49,450
Oh, our Punisher.

9490
07:47:50,210 --> 07:47:50,650
He's one though.

9491
07:47:55,310 --> 07:47:56,650
He's pushing up for it.

9492
07:47:58,890 --> 07:47:59,630
I'm going against Strange.

9493
07:47:59,930 --> 07:48:01,110
Strange, Strange, one, Strange, one.

9494
07:48:02,190 --> 07:48:03,610
They have ult too.

9495
07:48:05,370 --> 07:48:06,750
Our enemy is on here.

9496
07:48:08,430 --> 07:48:09,430
I'm damage boosting you, Punisher.

9497
07:48:12,850 --> 07:48:14,970
Hawkeye is on high ground.

9498
07:48:15,330 --> 07:48:16,610
I am one, I am one, I am one.

9499
07:48:16,630 --> 07:48:17,870
He's trying to...

9500
07:48:17,870 --> 07:48:18,870
There's a, there's a...

9501
07:48:18,870 --> 07:48:20,790
There's a Adam turret.

9502
07:48:22,330 --> 07:48:23,850
Our Magneto got hooked.

9503
07:48:24,850 --> 07:48:26,170
I slept Strange.

9504
07:48:26,410 --> 07:48:27,230
I can't kill this guy.

9505
07:48:29,930 --> 07:48:30,650
I got you.

9506
07:48:34,450 --> 07:48:36,250
Strange is half, Strange is low, Strange is low.

9507
07:48:38,670 --> 07:48:39,310
Try now.

9508
07:48:41,270 --> 07:48:42,270
I'm ulting you for this.

9509
07:48:44,810 --> 07:48:45,530
He's low, he's low.

9510
07:48:46,750 --> 07:48:47,110
Nice.

9511
07:48:49,890 --> 07:48:51,710
There's a Mantis cocooning.

9512
07:48:51,950 --> 07:48:52,150
Maybe?

9513
07:48:58,400 --> 07:48:59,320
I should've just looked out.

9514
07:48:59,500 --> 07:49:00,080
Go, go for some reason.

9515
07:49:05,040 --> 07:49:06,160
Nice Mantis ult, by the way.

9516
07:49:06,680 --> 07:49:07,320
Really clutch.

9517
07:49:07,560 --> 07:49:08,660
Oh, behind us, behind us, behind us, behind us.

9518
07:49:08,820 --> 07:49:09,760
I'm gonna die to this.

9519
07:49:10,060 --> 07:49:10,520
I'm dead.

9520
07:49:10,640 --> 07:49:11,540
I'm cocooning now.

9521
07:49:13,180 --> 07:49:14,180
Someone has to touch him.

9522
07:49:17,520 --> 07:49:18,580
I'm trying to save you.

9523
07:49:18,660 --> 07:49:19,600
I got you, I got you, I got you.

9524
07:49:24,260 --> 07:49:25,880
I can hook you up, sir.

9525
07:49:27,120 --> 07:49:28,500
I'm on it, I'm on it.

9526
07:49:29,860 --> 07:49:30,180
But...

9527
07:49:30,180 --> 07:49:31,140
I'm dead.

9528
07:49:39,950 --> 07:49:41,930
I have some scores to settle.

9529
07:49:49,300 --> 07:49:51,000
Shake it up.

9530
07:49:51,280 --> 07:49:53,020
I will crush them all.

9531
07:49:56,280 --> 07:49:57,540
Strange is half.

9532
07:49:57,880 --> 07:49:58,320
Mantis one.

9533
07:50:01,160 --> 07:50:02,240
Mantis still mid-life, by the way.

9534
07:50:02,680 --> 07:50:03,200
Mantis one.

9535
07:50:03,760 --> 07:50:05,260
I appreciate you.

9536
07:50:06,400 --> 07:50:07,200
Turret's close.

9537
07:50:07,320 --> 07:50:08,020
Oh my god.

9538
07:50:08,720 --> 07:50:09,420
Stop them!

9539
07:50:09,420 --> 07:50:10,760
She's looking.

9540
07:50:12,160 --> 07:50:13,260
I'm trying to keep you up.

9541
07:50:16,000 --> 07:50:20,220
I keep trying to kill him, but...

9542
07:50:20,220 --> 07:50:21,460
Oh, you're all so low.

9543
07:50:21,580 --> 07:50:22,180
I got one.

9544
07:50:23,000 --> 07:50:24,040
We should push up, we should push up.

9545
07:50:24,120 --> 07:50:24,580
We're up two.

9546
07:50:29,580 --> 07:50:30,920
I have ult here.

9547
07:50:31,480 --> 07:50:32,360
I got hook.

9548
07:50:33,080 --> 07:50:34,060
I'm trying my best.

9549
07:50:36,120 --> 07:50:37,580
We can't shield yet.

9550
07:50:38,620 --> 07:50:40,060
Oh, I should have ulted, sorry.

9551
07:50:42,720 --> 07:50:43,640
I got hooked.

9552
07:50:48,190 --> 07:50:49,630
They might have to...

9553
07:50:49,630 --> 07:50:51,470
They have strange ult, too.

9554
07:51:00,010 --> 07:51:01,330
I'm damage boosting you.

9555
07:51:03,230 --> 07:51:03,630
I'm one.

9556
07:51:04,010 --> 07:51:04,770
I'm ulting this.

9557
07:51:05,010 --> 07:51:05,870
I'm coming up.

9558
07:51:06,110 --> 07:51:07,530
But they're gonna have strange ult here.

9559
07:51:14,370 --> 07:51:14,690
I'm ready.

9560
07:51:15,910 --> 07:51:16,630
Trina's looking for ult.

9561
07:51:16,690 --> 07:51:17,310
Trina's looking for ult.

9562
07:51:17,330 --> 07:51:18,070
On the back, on the back.

9563
07:51:23,790 --> 07:51:26,690
I'm on point, I'm on point.

9564
07:51:27,570 --> 07:51:28,830
I slept the...

9565
07:51:28,830 --> 07:51:29,410
Oh, I didn't sleep.

9566
07:51:30,650 --> 07:51:31,910
Mantis is low, Mantis is low.

9567
07:51:35,190 --> 07:51:36,770
Trina's one, Trina's low, Trina's low.

9568
07:51:39,350 --> 07:51:40,510
I got him, I got him, I got him.

9569
07:51:42,010 --> 07:51:43,470
Get the Mantis.

9570
07:51:47,210 --> 07:51:48,370
Oh my god.

9571
07:51:49,470 --> 07:51:49,890
Again.

9572
07:51:51,830 --> 07:51:52,250
Again.

9573
07:51:58,610 --> 07:52:00,030
Oh, shit.

9574
07:52:00,730 --> 07:52:02,130
I gotta start focusing more.

9575
07:52:06,130 --> 07:52:08,370
I gotta focus up.

9576
07:52:09,170 --> 07:52:10,150
Oh my god.

9577
07:52:10,510 --> 07:52:13,190
These games have been, like, so difficult.

9578
07:52:17,100 --> 07:52:18,520
Oh my god.

9579
07:52:21,620 --> 07:52:23,000
I have to lock in.

9580
07:52:23,720 --> 07:52:24,900
I have to lock in.

9581
07:52:25,280 --> 07:52:25,980
Oh my god.

9582
07:52:26,060 --> 07:52:28,500
These games have actually been, like...

9583
07:52:28,500 --> 07:52:30,680
They've been really good games.

9584
07:52:30,780 --> 07:52:33,700
They've actually been, like, insane quality games.

9585
07:52:36,780 --> 07:52:37,820
Like, I don't...

9586
07:52:37,820 --> 07:52:39,440
The only bad game I could remember...

9587
07:52:40,040 --> 07:52:41,660
Was the Mantis one.

9588
07:52:41,660 --> 07:52:43,220
That was a fucking terrible game.

9589
07:52:43,280 --> 07:52:45,620
But other than that, all these games have been, like, really fun to play.

9590
07:52:47,280 --> 07:52:48,680
I just need to focus up more.

9591
07:52:48,860 --> 07:52:49,960
I've been...

9592
07:52:49,960 --> 07:52:51,040
I can't help it.

9593
07:52:51,160 --> 07:52:51,900
I like fucking around.

9594
07:52:53,340 --> 07:52:55,680
I don't think we've ever won a TP fight.

9595
07:53:00,540 --> 07:53:01,340
We've been...

9596
07:53:01,340 --> 07:53:03,380
We've been live for seven hours.

9597
07:53:07,980 --> 07:53:11,080
Seven hours and only one TP worked.

9598
07:53:11,860 --> 07:53:12,300
Enjoy...

9599
07:53:12,300 --> 07:53:13,620
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

9600
07:53:14,440 --> 07:53:18,840
99% of strange players quit just before they hit a perfect TP play, okay?

9601
07:53:18,900 --> 07:53:19,400
Never give up.

9602
07:53:20,220 --> 07:53:22,720
Alright, this is it.

9603
07:53:22,780 --> 07:53:23,520
It's gonna work.

9604
07:53:23,980 --> 07:53:25,060
This is the one, baby.

9605
07:53:25,340 --> 07:53:26,240
This is the one.

9606
07:53:28,640 --> 07:53:30,080
This is the one.

9607
07:53:30,200 --> 07:53:30,840
This is it.

9608
07:53:30,980 --> 07:53:32,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

9609
07:53:33,960 --> 07:53:35,980
Awesome, guys.

9610
07:53:36,220 --> 07:53:36,580
We did it.

9611
07:53:36,920 --> 07:53:37,760
Did it work?

9612
07:53:39,540 --> 07:53:39,980
Yeah.

9613
07:53:40,720 --> 07:53:42,040
Atom is low.

9614
07:53:55,760 --> 07:53:59,100
Try our best.

9615
07:54:02,360 --> 07:54:06,400
This might be the 99%.

9616
07:54:11,060 --> 07:54:11,960
I got him, I got him.

9617
07:54:12,660 --> 07:54:14,020
I'm gonna cocoon, I'm gonna cocoon.

9618
07:54:14,320 --> 07:54:15,000
I'm cocooning.

9619
07:54:15,460 --> 07:54:16,300
Alright, Atom needs help, though.

9620
07:54:19,400 --> 07:54:21,160
Um, I'm fucked over here.

9621
07:54:22,900 --> 07:54:24,400
I slept him, but...

9622
07:54:24,400 --> 07:54:24,580
Yeah.

9623
07:54:30,420 --> 07:54:34,620
I'm trying to save you, I'm trying to save you.

9624
07:54:38,660 --> 07:54:40,220
Oh, I didn't have any leaves left.

9625
07:54:42,020 --> 07:54:43,680
That was the 99%, guys.

9626
07:54:45,880 --> 07:54:46,200
Nevermind.

9627
07:54:46,220 --> 07:54:47,000
I didn't have any leaves.

9628
07:54:47,040 --> 07:54:47,340
Nevermind.

9629
07:54:48,500 --> 07:54:49,160
I might need donations.

9630
07:54:52,880 --> 07:54:56,120
I have ult here, but they have their aggressive ult still.

9631
07:54:56,460 --> 07:54:57,640
There's like an Atom turret left.

9632
07:55:02,640 --> 07:55:03,500
Atom loves me.

9633
07:55:10,520 --> 07:55:11,600
Oh, my god.

9634
07:55:15,250 --> 07:55:16,930
We're not 6 yet.

9635
07:55:20,050 --> 07:55:21,390
I'm not gonna use anything.

9636
07:55:22,010 --> 07:55:23,210
There's a sleep, though.

9637
07:55:25,350 --> 07:55:26,650
Alright, let's... I guess.

9638
07:55:29,730 --> 07:55:30,810
What the fuck?

9639
07:55:31,090 --> 07:55:32,250
You're okay, you're so healthy.

9640
07:55:34,430 --> 07:55:35,890
Atom turret left, Atom turret left.

9641
07:55:39,230 --> 07:55:42,030
I'm breaking the lamp.

9642
07:55:43,750 --> 07:55:45,690
I'm asleep, I'm asleep, I'm asleep, I'm asleep.

9643
07:55:45,910 --> 07:55:46,690
Focus point, focus point.

9644
07:55:46,690 --> 07:55:48,410
I'm trying to keep her mag me up.

9645
07:55:48,790 --> 07:55:49,770
Oh, you're so low.

9646
07:55:50,510 --> 07:55:51,690
I'm trying to...

9647
07:55:55,490 --> 07:55:57,230
I have no leaves, I have no leaves.

9648
07:55:59,510 --> 07:56:01,210
They're left, they're left, there's a Hawkeye.

9649
07:56:02,670 --> 07:56:04,070
There's a Mantis turret main, too.

9650
07:56:09,330 --> 07:56:11,570
He also has, he also has a Hawkeye.

9651
07:56:12,990 --> 07:56:13,910
Got him, I got him.

9652
07:56:16,690 --> 07:56:18,670
Make some noise, make some noise, make some noise.

9653
07:56:19,170 --> 07:56:21,550
I'm on, I'm on strange, I'm on strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange.

9654
07:56:23,510 --> 07:56:24,850
I have Atom on me.

9655
07:56:27,430 --> 07:56:28,930
Oh my god, there's an Atom behind.

9656
07:56:29,530 --> 07:56:30,430
I got them both.

9657
07:56:31,310 --> 07:56:32,310
I got two strange kills.

9658
07:56:35,310 --> 07:56:36,030
I got...

9659
07:56:39,310 --> 07:56:40,450
I got Mantis.

9660
07:56:42,790 --> 07:56:45,790
Look, there's just Mantis following us.

9661
07:56:50,200 --> 07:56:51,480
Oh my god.

9662
07:56:57,160 --> 07:56:58,220
He's Atom.

9663
07:57:00,440 --> 07:57:02,540
I don't think I saw a strange though.

9664
07:57:03,960 --> 07:57:04,680
Yeah, yeah.

9665
07:57:07,220 --> 07:57:08,560
Nice pick on Hawkeye.

9666
07:57:11,000 --> 07:57:12,360
I'm on the cart now.

9667
07:57:16,260 --> 07:57:19,100
I'm on the cart, I'm on the cart.

9668
07:57:19,400 --> 07:57:20,020
So, alright.

9669
07:57:20,120 --> 07:57:26,260
I can't heal you guys back there.

9670
07:57:36,370 --> 07:57:38,050
Nice, nice pick.

9671
07:57:41,870 --> 07:57:42,630
I'm using this.

9672
07:57:45,690 --> 07:57:47,250
The strange is pushing us.

9673
07:57:50,510 --> 07:57:51,490
Strange is up, strange is one.

9674
07:57:53,410 --> 07:57:54,990
He's still low, he's still one, he's still low.

9675
07:57:55,150 --> 07:57:56,350
I got him, I got him, I got him.

9676
07:57:57,250 --> 07:57:58,130
We have Adamult.

9677
07:58:00,270 --> 07:58:01,810
I don't think... No, no, no, no, no.

9678
07:58:01,850 --> 07:58:02,530
We don't need it, we don't need it.

9679
07:58:02,690 --> 07:58:05,510
I'm on the Mantis is heading high ground, the Mantis is heading high ground.

9680
07:58:05,790 --> 07:58:06,850
Turn around, turn around, turn around.

9681
07:58:11,740 --> 07:58:12,380
They're staggering.

9682
07:58:16,100 --> 07:58:17,000
Careful, it's a mortar boat.

9683
07:58:17,800 --> 07:58:19,420
I slept Loki, I slept Loki.

9684
07:58:19,580 --> 07:58:20,400
Blam, blam, blam.

9685
07:58:23,360 --> 07:58:23,980
I see one.

9686
07:58:25,040 --> 07:58:25,780
Strange is half.

9687
07:58:26,360 --> 07:58:28,680
They have Born again, they have used Born again.

9688
07:58:29,580 --> 07:58:30,860
I can't get to you.

9689
07:58:32,680 --> 07:58:33,200
Okay.

9690
07:58:34,180 --> 07:58:35,000
I'm pushing them.

9691
07:58:35,420 --> 07:58:36,760
Hawkeye low, Hawkeye low.

9692
07:58:38,680 --> 07:58:40,180
I'm trying to help you.

9693
07:58:41,480 --> 07:58:42,720
Adam one, Adam...

9694
07:58:43,320 --> 07:58:44,960
I'm trying my best.

9695
07:58:45,920 --> 07:58:47,220
You are doing your best.

9696
07:58:47,760 --> 07:58:49,200
I'm trying my best.

9697
07:58:52,060 --> 07:58:54,780
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam one, Adam one.

9698
07:58:55,780 --> 07:58:56,080
Oh.

9699
07:58:57,740 --> 07:59:00,160
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

9700
07:59:03,780 --> 07:59:05,120
Jesus Christ.

9701
07:59:06,860 --> 07:59:08,720
I saw that solo on the Hawkeye.

9702
07:59:09,240 --> 07:59:14,860
That poor guy.

9703
07:59:15,180 --> 07:59:17,080
I soloed that Adam and Hawkeye.

9704
07:59:19,960 --> 07:59:22,180
I'm close to my ult.

9705
07:59:26,280 --> 07:59:27,320
I'm on stream.

9706
07:59:28,300 --> 07:59:29,180
Strange is...

9707
07:59:29,180 --> 07:59:30,280
Oh, never mind, he's getting healed.

9708
07:59:35,080 --> 07:59:35,860
Nice, let's get this.

9709
07:59:37,080 --> 07:59:38,080
Oh, I couldn't start.

9710
07:59:41,740 --> 07:59:43,060
Strange, Strange, Strange, Strange, Strange.

9711
07:59:45,820 --> 07:59:48,000
I'm going to push up.

9712
07:59:56,990 --> 07:59:58,430
Second chance, don't worry.

9713
08:00:01,530 --> 08:00:02,730
Nice pick, nice pick.

9714
08:00:05,650 --> 08:00:07,510
Yeah, I'm waiting for my ult.

9715
08:00:08,470 --> 08:00:09,610
I'm using it, I have to use it.

9716
08:00:12,270 --> 08:00:13,190
I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

9717
08:00:13,690 --> 08:00:14,310
I got...

9718
08:00:14,310 --> 08:00:14,890
Strange, Strange, Strange.

9719
08:00:23,510 --> 08:00:24,730
I'm trying to keep you up.

9720
08:00:25,670 --> 08:00:27,590
Mantis, Mantis, Mantis on point, Mantis on point.

9721
08:00:29,210 --> 08:00:29,790
Mantis low.

9722
08:00:31,270 --> 08:00:33,230
Oh my god.

9723
08:00:36,190 --> 08:00:39,070
No, what?

9724
08:00:40,510 --> 08:00:41,590
Yeah, they didn't push it.

9725
08:00:46,610 --> 08:00:47,330
GG's.

9726
08:00:49,050 --> 08:00:50,530
What a fucking comeback.

9727
08:00:51,670 --> 08:00:52,870
The voices.

9728
08:00:54,490 --> 08:00:55,970
I was like, what do you mean?

9729
08:00:57,830 --> 08:01:00,830
He forgot we fucking held that.

9730
08:01:01,210 --> 08:01:02,410
He like, he forgot.

9731
08:01:05,490 --> 08:01:06,750
Oh my god.

9732
08:01:06,910 --> 08:01:08,750
Oh, thank god we have fast games.

9733
08:01:08,950 --> 08:01:10,130
I can't feel...

9734
08:01:10,130 --> 08:01:11,370
Thank god.

9735
08:01:12,030 --> 08:01:14,750
Thank fucking god we have fast games.

9736
08:01:16,910 --> 08:01:17,410
Okay.

9737
08:01:19,370 --> 08:01:20,430
We win these, right?

9738
08:01:21,130 --> 08:01:22,530
Yeah, I don't...

9739
08:01:22,530 --> 08:01:23,290
We are still in the...

9740
08:01:23,290 --> 08:01:25,830
I think we just ban the classic, no?

9741
08:01:26,390 --> 08:01:28,970
I think we ban Luna, we ban Mantis.

9742
08:01:29,150 --> 08:01:31,050
Just so Doki can't play anything.

9743
08:01:31,210 --> 08:01:32,710
I can play any...

9744
08:01:32,710 --> 08:01:33,790
I can flex.

9745
08:01:35,950 --> 08:01:40,310
I can literally play all the other healers except for Loki.

9746
08:01:47,210 --> 08:01:51,410
I have a positive win rate on Adam.

9747
08:01:51,730 --> 08:01:53,010
We don't talk about Cloak though.

9748
08:01:53,510 --> 08:01:53,950
We don't...

9749
08:01:53,950 --> 08:01:56,250
We don't talk about Cloak.

9750
08:01:57,990 --> 08:02:00,750
Cloak is a 30% win rate.

9751
08:02:01,210 --> 08:02:03,370
I do it.

9752
08:02:03,470 --> 08:02:04,570
No, I'm gonna do it.

9753
08:02:15,790 --> 08:02:20,230
You're so lucky.

9754
08:02:20,430 --> 08:02:21,610
You guys are so lucky.

9755
08:02:31,510 --> 08:02:32,550
Fucking cowards.

9756
08:02:33,090 --> 08:02:33,610
Cowards.

9757
08:02:33,810 --> 08:02:35,310
They don't believe in me!

9758
08:02:39,410 --> 08:02:40,450
They don't...

9759
08:02:40,450 --> 08:02:41,430
I don't understand.

9760
08:02:41,730 --> 08:02:42,990
Why don't they believe in me?

9761
08:02:43,110 --> 08:02:44,830
I literally have a positive win rate.

9762
08:02:45,270 --> 08:02:46,250
On Adam.

9763
08:02:46,750 --> 08:02:47,490
But not Cloak.

9764
08:02:47,570 --> 08:02:48,090
But on Adam.

9765
08:02:48,790 --> 08:02:50,790
I have a positive win rate on all the other supports.

9766
08:02:54,350 --> 08:02:59,890
Wait a minute, I can't play Loki.

9767
08:03:00,250 --> 08:03:01,350
Loki, you have to...

9768
08:03:01,350 --> 08:03:02,090
Loki...

9769
08:03:02,090 --> 08:03:04,290
There's too much thinking involved when it comes to Loki.

9770
08:03:04,450 --> 08:03:07,870
It's actually crazy how much thinking is involved for Loki.

9771
08:03:11,650 --> 08:03:14,350
I don't play this role good.

9772
08:03:17,330 --> 08:03:21,470
There's like a lot of like things you gotta know how...

9773
08:03:21,470 --> 08:03:23,970
What to do for Loki.

9774
08:03:25,050 --> 08:03:25,970
Like his...

9775
08:03:25,970 --> 08:03:27,570
Especially like the copy ability.

9776
08:03:28,010 --> 08:03:30,830
It's like you have to decide what to copy to.

9777
08:03:30,830 --> 08:03:31,870
In the moment.

9778
08:03:32,930 --> 08:03:33,830
It's such a...

9779
08:03:34,710 --> 08:03:35,990
Like you gotta think a lot.

9780
08:03:36,910 --> 08:03:37,350
Wait, what?

9781
08:03:37,490 --> 08:03:37,730
Why?

9782
08:03:39,150 --> 08:03:39,970
Wait, why is it my fault?

9783
08:03:41,450 --> 08:03:42,250
I'm teleporting.

9784
08:03:42,450 --> 08:03:43,150
Please focus here.

9785
08:03:54,880 --> 08:03:58,520
I might have slightly miscalculated my positioning on the portal, but it's okay.

9786
08:03:58,520 --> 08:04:01,960
Okay, that's Ken.

9787
08:04:02,140 --> 08:04:02,600
Ken's Loki.

9788
08:04:06,740 --> 08:04:07,820
Oh, he does it.

9789
08:04:08,960 --> 08:04:10,480
Oh my god.

9790
08:04:14,100 --> 08:04:15,160
Trin Trin Trin Trin!

9791
08:04:15,260 --> 08:04:15,760
Trin's up!

9792
08:04:19,840 --> 08:04:21,800
There, they used Linkage.

9793
08:04:24,320 --> 08:04:25,600
Look at him.

9794
08:04:25,900 --> 08:04:28,200
I'm half, I'm half.

9795
08:04:28,800 --> 08:04:29,740
I'm at you.

9796
08:04:32,720 --> 08:04:33,320
You guys can?

9797
08:04:34,980 --> 08:04:35,900
I'm looking at him.

9798
08:04:37,920 --> 08:04:38,840
I'm playing, I'm playing.

9799
08:04:38,920 --> 08:04:40,060
Set one, set one, set one, set one.

9800
08:04:40,540 --> 08:04:42,080
We can't see you, we can't see you over there.

9801
08:04:44,360 --> 08:04:47,820
I have to reload, I have to reload.

9802
08:04:51,460 --> 08:04:53,320
Oh my god, you're taking too much damage.

9803
08:04:53,980 --> 08:04:54,380
Yeah.

9804
08:04:56,420 --> 08:04:57,520
I can ult this.

9805
08:04:57,880 --> 08:04:58,780
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

9806
08:04:58,880 --> 08:04:59,460
Yes, yes, yes.

9807
08:05:00,200 --> 08:05:00,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9808
08:05:00,660 --> 08:05:01,180
Nice, nice, nice.

9809
08:05:01,600 --> 08:05:02,720
If I don't point, you heal.

9810
08:05:04,440 --> 08:05:05,340
I'm onto Namor.

9811
08:05:06,680 --> 08:05:08,780
Three, two, one, I'm backing out.

9812
08:05:11,340 --> 08:05:12,340
Trin Trin Trin Trin!

9813
08:05:12,380 --> 08:05:12,860
She can't heal!

9814
08:05:19,340 --> 08:05:21,140
I'm keeping you up, Namor.

9815
08:05:24,920 --> 08:05:26,400
I am on point now, I'm on point.

9816
08:05:26,400 --> 08:05:27,640
Okay, okay, I'm keeping you up, Namor.

9817
08:05:31,180 --> 08:05:32,040
I'm dying here.

9818
08:05:32,320 --> 08:05:33,800
Oh, I'm fighting, I'm gonna die.

9819
08:05:34,980 --> 08:05:36,520
Somebody on point, we need to touch on point.

9820
08:05:37,360 --> 08:05:38,100
I'm on point, I'm on point.

9821
08:05:38,820 --> 08:05:40,480
I'm trying to keep you up, I'm trying to keep you up on point.

9822
08:05:42,840 --> 08:05:44,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm leaving.

9823
08:05:48,120 --> 08:05:48,480
Goodbye.

9824
08:05:53,500 --> 08:05:54,840
That's a strange ult.

9825
08:05:56,040 --> 08:05:56,760
Okay, I have it.

9826
08:05:59,440 --> 08:06:04,320
You know, I've seen all Wolverine players, like, ult when they strange ult and just cancel his ult.

9827
08:06:05,440 --> 08:06:07,240
Or if he can't also stun you.

9828
08:06:08,280 --> 08:06:11,740
It's so weird that I can't see the... I'm like so focused now.

9829
08:06:12,360 --> 08:06:13,720
I froze him too, I froze him too!

9830
08:06:17,640 --> 08:06:18,520
Reborn again.

9831
08:06:25,420 --> 08:06:26,320
Why is this strange, bro?

9832
08:06:26,480 --> 08:06:27,120
I'm so confused.

9833
08:06:27,600 --> 08:06:29,040
I don't know where he'd go.

9834
08:06:31,280 --> 08:06:31,980
Stay close, stay close.

9835
08:06:32,980 --> 08:06:35,700
I need to reload, I need to reload.

9836
08:06:38,280 --> 08:06:38,940
Nice, nice, nice.

9837
08:06:39,880 --> 08:06:40,260
I'm on one.

9838
08:06:41,100 --> 08:06:41,920
I'm taking point, I'm taking point.

9839
08:06:42,280 --> 08:06:42,760
TP, TP!

9840
08:06:43,780 --> 08:06:44,100
Oh!

9841
08:06:46,200 --> 08:06:47,400
Dead game, dead game, dead game, dead game!

9842
08:06:48,280 --> 08:06:49,180
That was insane!

9843
08:06:51,340 --> 08:06:51,900
Holy!

9844
08:06:52,620 --> 08:06:53,600
I hear someone to my right.

9845
08:07:00,000 --> 08:07:02,740
They don't have TP, so we should be fine.

9846
08:07:05,020 --> 08:07:07,500
I still hear someone walking nearby.

9847
08:07:08,420 --> 08:07:09,380
Let's move, let's go.

9848
08:07:11,300 --> 08:07:12,540
I don't know where the strange is.

9849
08:07:17,120 --> 08:07:19,440
I'm ulting, I'm on the, I'm on the strange.

9850
08:07:23,460 --> 08:07:24,560
Can you grab him?

9851
08:07:25,600 --> 08:07:26,600
If you grab him, I ult.

9852
08:07:26,960 --> 08:07:29,780
3, 2, 1, back down.

9853
08:07:34,280 --> 08:07:36,220
I have no more on me, no more on one!

9854
08:07:37,500 --> 08:07:38,840
Your powers are mine!

9855
08:07:38,900 --> 08:07:40,680
Alright, I'm ready to put on a show!

9856
08:07:40,760 --> 08:07:41,740
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

9857
08:07:43,360 --> 08:07:44,780
Oh, be ready, be ready, be ready!

9858
08:07:46,420 --> 08:07:47,420
I'm blinking, I'm blinking.

9859
08:07:47,520 --> 08:07:49,080
I got hit by the strange.

9860
08:07:51,420 --> 08:07:52,880
I don't, is it winnable?

9861
08:07:53,160 --> 08:07:53,960
I have point, I have point.

9862
08:07:54,020 --> 08:07:54,360
Let's hit.

9863
08:07:54,620 --> 08:07:55,460
No, no, no, no.

9864
08:08:01,020 --> 08:08:01,580
Stranger ult.

9865
08:08:02,680 --> 08:08:05,180
Are they still, did they ult it or no?

9866
08:08:05,240 --> 08:08:07,140
They used stranger, they used it.

9867
08:08:08,580 --> 08:08:09,500
They used Loki.

9868
08:08:11,000 --> 08:08:12,220
Yeah, they did, I saw it.

9869
08:08:13,000 --> 08:08:15,100
Either way, the plan is...

9870
08:08:15,780 --> 08:08:16,160
BERSERKER!

9871
08:08:17,680 --> 08:08:19,760
Yeah, I have a snowflake on you.

9872
08:08:20,060 --> 08:08:21,020
For the berserker.

9873
08:08:21,220 --> 08:08:21,320
Yep.

9874
08:08:24,700 --> 08:08:25,740
I'm looking point, I'm looking point.

9875
08:08:27,940 --> 08:08:29,200
They know I'm on the left, I'm fine.

9876
08:08:32,540 --> 08:08:33,320
I'm gonna look again.

9877
08:08:33,940 --> 08:08:34,820
I'm looking now, I'm looking now.

9878
08:08:35,540 --> 08:08:36,820
You guys can...

9879
08:08:38,380 --> 08:08:40,820
Oh, you fucking exploded.

9880
08:08:43,860 --> 08:08:45,320
We're even, we're even.

9881
08:08:48,440 --> 08:08:49,440
This is last fight.

9882
08:08:50,400 --> 08:08:52,360
Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, no, the server is...

9883
08:08:52,360 --> 08:08:53,880
The server is getting doxxed.

9884
08:08:56,360 --> 08:08:58,320
The server is getting doxxed.

9885
08:08:59,720 --> 08:09:03,200
Oh, he fell off!

9886
08:09:05,220 --> 08:09:07,060
I'm ulting on point!

9887
08:09:10,980 --> 08:09:15,820
I don't think anybody gets...

9888
08:09:17,980 --> 08:09:18,800
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice!

9889
08:09:20,080 --> 08:09:21,400
Strange, strange, strange, strange!

9890
08:09:21,580 --> 08:09:22,400
Focus strange, please!

9891
08:09:27,040 --> 08:09:28,760
Please focus strange, please focus strange!

9892
08:09:31,400 --> 08:09:32,620
Starlord, starlord, starlord!

9893
08:09:32,740 --> 08:09:33,800
Starlord half, starlord half!

9894
08:09:34,820 --> 08:09:37,020
He's ulting, he's ulting, he's ulting.

9895
08:09:37,340 --> 08:09:38,440
He's gonna touch though, isn't he?

9896
08:09:38,440 --> 08:09:38,980
Oh no.

9897
08:09:40,400 --> 08:09:42,340
Must be the work of an enemy stat.

9898
08:09:43,060 --> 08:09:44,060
Holy shit!

9899
08:09:45,200 --> 08:09:46,970
You guys, wait, they think we DDoSed!

9900
08:09:54,910 --> 08:09:57,610
I thought it was bad for us!

9901
08:09:58,670 --> 08:09:59,210
Zawardo!

9902
08:10:05,110 --> 08:10:06,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9903
08:10:06,810 --> 08:10:08,030
Why did they think we...

9904
08:10:08,030 --> 08:10:09,590
I should learn Japanese and Indian dialect.

9905
08:10:09,610 --> 08:10:11,430
Y'all are some cowards!

9906
08:10:11,430 --> 08:10:14,330
And then when they get unstuck, like, time has started moving again.

9907
08:10:14,650 --> 08:10:15,950
That's crazy!

9908
08:10:16,230 --> 08:10:17,430
Oh, it looked...

9909
08:10:17,430 --> 08:10:20,690
I felt like it was harder for us!

9910
08:10:23,230 --> 08:10:26,090
It felt like we were at a disadvantage!

9911
08:10:27,950 --> 08:10:28,590
Why?

9912
08:10:31,590 --> 08:10:33,850
Bro, like, we had to get the point!

9913
08:10:34,030 --> 08:10:38,690
How was, like, our team that was supposed to DDoS this?

9914
08:10:39,570 --> 08:10:42,790
We were literally fucking fighting for our lives!

9915
08:10:47,930 --> 08:10:48,830
Starlord where?

9916
08:10:49,050 --> 08:10:49,690
We went left.

9917
08:10:59,210 --> 08:11:01,350
I might be...

9918
08:11:01,350 --> 08:11:01,950
Fuck you.

9919
08:11:02,190 --> 08:11:02,970
I got it, I'm okay.

9920
08:11:07,190 --> 08:11:07,750
GG!

9921
08:11:08,530 --> 08:11:10,210
I don't have healing for this.

9922
08:11:14,930 --> 08:11:16,130
I'm so low!

9923
08:11:20,990 --> 08:11:22,810
Can we just die on point?

9924
08:11:23,090 --> 08:11:23,090
Yeah.

9925
08:11:29,110 --> 08:11:30,230
Ooh, nerds!

9926
08:11:46,580 --> 08:11:47,140
Woah!

9927
08:11:50,640 --> 08:11:51,740
Alright, Adam's not with us.

9928
08:11:51,780 --> 08:11:52,340
Okay,

9929
08:11:55,400 --> 08:11:55,960
Adam's here now.

9930
08:12:03,420 --> 08:12:04,920
I have ult now.

9931
08:12:13,280 --> 08:12:14,580
Train is half!

9932
08:12:14,860 --> 08:12:15,200
Train's low!

9933
08:12:15,200 --> 08:12:16,660
You have no lamp.

9934
08:12:21,020 --> 08:12:22,760
I don't see you.

9935
08:12:24,700 --> 08:12:25,780
He used it already.

9936
08:12:26,100 --> 08:12:27,100
He used it or you used it.

9937
08:12:28,360 --> 08:12:29,420
I'm ulting here.

9938
08:12:31,020 --> 08:12:32,440
But we won't have defense alone.

9939
08:12:35,900 --> 08:12:36,940
They TP'd.

9940
08:12:36,960 --> 08:12:37,500
They TP'd.

9941
08:12:40,260 --> 08:12:41,660
I'm backing out for you.

9942
08:12:43,060 --> 08:12:44,780
I froze Starlord!

9943
08:12:45,200 --> 08:12:45,600
No, no, no.

9944
08:12:45,640 --> 08:12:46,140
I see him.

9945
08:12:46,180 --> 08:12:46,400
I see him.

9946
08:12:46,460 --> 08:12:46,700
I see him.

9947
08:12:47,520 --> 08:12:48,180
They're born again!

9948
08:12:48,260 --> 08:12:48,680
They're born again!

9949
08:12:53,020 --> 08:12:53,960
No more slow!

9950
08:12:54,080 --> 08:12:54,620
No more slow!

9951
08:13:01,660 --> 08:13:02,560
Our Adam... No.

9952
08:13:02,700 --> 08:13:03,480
Our Adam DC'd.

9953
08:13:03,500 --> 08:13:04,200
Our Adam DC'd.

9954
08:13:06,060 --> 08:13:06,420
Actually,

9955
08:13:11,540 --> 08:13:12,000
I don't know.

9956
08:13:12,080 --> 08:13:12,780
He stood still.

9957
08:13:16,120 --> 08:13:17,040
Oh no, he's back.

9958
08:13:20,320 --> 08:13:21,100
I can touch.

9959
08:13:21,180 --> 08:13:21,560
I can touch.

9960
08:13:21,720 --> 08:13:22,960
I can TP, actually.

9961
08:13:23,540 --> 08:13:24,620
If you can touch, I TP.

9962
08:13:24,820 --> 08:13:26,380
Um, they're looking at me right now.

9963
08:13:29,620 --> 08:13:30,620
You have a TP back.

9964
08:13:31,680 --> 08:13:32,480
Adam, you can ult.

9965
08:13:33,180 --> 08:13:33,840
I'm gonna die here.

9966
08:13:34,640 --> 08:13:35,500
We really need it.

9967
08:13:36,560 --> 08:13:37,860
Okay, I got it.

9968
08:13:37,940 --> 08:13:38,180
I got it.

9969
08:13:38,280 --> 08:13:39,540
But we just can touch next.

9970
08:13:40,240 --> 08:13:40,800
Just touching next.

9971
08:13:40,800 --> 08:13:42,240
I go, I go, I go, I go.

9972
08:13:44,360 --> 08:13:45,620
They used Strangereal.

9973
08:13:45,820 --> 08:13:46,340
Yeah, they did.

9974
08:13:46,520 --> 08:13:46,520
They did.

9975
08:13:46,900 --> 08:13:47,620
They used Strangereal.

9976
08:13:47,800 --> 08:13:48,340
They used Strangereal.

9977
08:13:48,720 --> 08:13:52,760
He assumed he died to Legendary, didn't notice Doki.

9978
08:13:53,340 --> 08:13:54,880
I literally looked at him.

9979
08:13:54,980 --> 08:13:56,620
I was like, I don't...

9980
08:13:56,620 --> 08:13:58,340
He just stood there.

9981
08:13:58,700 --> 08:14:00,200
He like accepted his fate.

9982
08:14:01,720 --> 08:14:05,060
He accepted his fate and just fucking died.

9983
08:14:07,520 --> 08:14:10,180
I just like watched him stare at the Adam.

9984
08:14:10,800 --> 08:14:12,480
I was staring at Starler.

9985
08:14:12,500 --> 08:14:13,560
I was like, what are you doing?

9986
08:14:16,500 --> 08:14:18,260
Yeah, the fucking slow turn.

9987
08:14:18,440 --> 08:14:18,800
He's like...

9988
08:14:25,900 --> 08:14:27,920
I like killed him and everything.

9989
08:14:28,080 --> 08:14:29,080
I was like, what are you doing?

9990
08:14:29,860 --> 08:14:30,800
I'm just doing sub guys.

9991
08:14:35,200 --> 08:14:36,340
Moon Knight for what, Kim?

9992
08:14:37,180 --> 08:14:38,420
Yeah, Moon Knight players.

9993
08:14:39,280 --> 08:14:39,800
Yeah.

9994
08:14:44,080 --> 08:14:45,020
Oh, no.

9995
08:14:45,420 --> 08:14:47,280
I just walked up the stairs twice.

9996
08:14:47,640 --> 08:14:48,340
Oh, no.

9997
08:14:48,820 --> 08:14:50,620
I don't feel so good.

9998
08:14:52,600 --> 08:14:54,060
I don't think they took the bait.

9999
08:14:54,280 --> 08:14:54,840
They are main.

10000
08:15:01,220 --> 08:15:01,740
Oh,

10001
08:15:05,920 --> 08:15:07,080
he fell down the stairs.

10002
08:15:07,360 --> 08:15:07,400
Oh, no, no.

10003
08:15:08,420 --> 08:15:09,080
Yeah, it's fine.

10004
08:15:10,220 --> 08:15:10,980
Change left side.

10005
08:15:13,760 --> 08:15:14,700
Oh, nice assist.

10006
08:15:15,260 --> 08:15:17,240
I have this guy.

10007
08:15:19,620 --> 08:15:20,540
They reload.

10008
08:15:22,700 --> 08:15:23,700
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam.

10009
08:15:25,540 --> 08:15:26,540
He has born again.

10010
08:15:28,400 --> 08:15:29,240
Nice, nice, nice.

10011
08:15:29,840 --> 08:15:30,600
I'm on point.

10012
08:15:33,060 --> 08:15:35,400
They have Starlord all of a sudden.

10013
08:15:40,820 --> 08:15:41,620
They reload.

10014
08:15:44,600 --> 08:15:46,460
I froze, I froze Strange.

10015
08:15:47,620 --> 08:15:48,620
I'm ulting on point.

10016
08:15:48,720 --> 08:15:49,260
I'm ulting on point.

10017
08:15:49,880 --> 08:15:51,180
We gotta push the backline.

10018
08:15:51,720 --> 08:15:51,900
Yeah.

10019
08:15:55,260 --> 08:15:56,480
We got the point.

10020
08:15:56,820 --> 08:15:57,920
Starlord, Strange, Strange, Strange.

10021
08:16:00,040 --> 08:16:00,560
Starlord.

10022
08:16:02,180 --> 08:16:02,700
Alright.

10023
08:16:05,720 --> 08:16:07,740
They Adam ulted that, but they still have Luna.

10024
08:16:08,800 --> 08:16:10,600
They used low-key with an Adam ult.

10025
08:16:11,000 --> 08:16:11,860
They have Adam ult.

10026
08:16:14,300 --> 08:16:15,340
Oh, it was low-key Adam?

10027
08:16:15,480 --> 08:16:15,580
Okay.

10028
08:16:16,680 --> 08:16:17,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10029
08:16:17,420 --> 08:16:18,620
They might TP, they might TP.

10030
08:16:24,140 --> 08:16:25,020
They used Ling, though.

10031
08:16:25,060 --> 08:16:25,360
They used Ling.

10032
08:16:31,040 --> 08:16:31,860
I'm on the left, by the way.

10033
08:16:32,380 --> 08:16:33,440
I'm on, I'm on Starlord on the left.

10034
08:16:33,940 --> 08:16:34,380
I'm on point.

10035
08:16:38,520 --> 08:16:39,080
We got Luna.

10036
08:16:41,300 --> 08:16:42,420
Kill Abel, kill Abel, kill Abel.

10037
08:16:45,340 --> 08:16:47,120
Oh my god, this Psylocke.

10038
08:16:47,260 --> 08:16:48,640
I'm gonna fucking break a table.

10039
08:16:49,700 --> 08:16:50,600
I have no shield.

10040
08:16:51,360 --> 08:16:52,800
Just keep poking them without dying.

10041
08:16:53,140 --> 08:16:53,480
Yeah, yeah.

10042
08:16:53,900 --> 08:16:54,700
I'm flying up.

10043
08:16:55,780 --> 08:16:56,580
I'm ulting on Luna.

10044
08:16:59,720 --> 08:17:00,540
I have to reload.

10045
08:17:01,280 --> 08:17:02,280
I got you, I got you.

10046
08:17:07,800 --> 08:17:09,480
I'm dying, I'm gonna die to this.

10047
08:17:10,940 --> 08:17:11,380
Yeah.

10048
08:17:15,380 --> 08:17:16,700
I mean, you can fight on point.

10049
08:17:16,800 --> 08:17:17,560
Just fight on point.

10050
08:17:20,960 --> 08:17:22,240
Oh my god.

10051
08:17:22,600 --> 08:17:24,060
That Nemoro was so good.

10052
08:17:24,080 --> 08:17:25,180
I have TP, I think.

10053
08:17:26,120 --> 08:17:26,300
Okay.

10054
08:17:26,440 --> 08:17:26,840
Let me check.

10055
08:17:27,020 --> 08:17:27,260
Alright.

10056
08:17:28,880 --> 08:17:29,420
Yeah, I do.

10057
08:17:29,540 --> 08:17:30,980
They Nemoro'd Strange ult back.

10058
08:17:31,240 --> 08:17:31,260
Yes.

10059
08:17:31,520 --> 08:17:33,680
I'm keeping my Luna for Starlord.

10060
08:17:34,940 --> 08:17:36,100
They also have Luna.

10061
08:17:36,340 --> 08:17:37,160
They're high ground.

10062
08:17:37,840 --> 08:17:39,860
I see their Luna, I see their Luna.

10063
08:17:40,280 --> 08:17:40,780
I am TPing.

10064
08:17:42,560 --> 08:17:43,660
He's here, he's here, he's here.

10065
08:17:45,520 --> 08:17:46,220
I'm killing Loki.

10066
08:17:49,020 --> 08:17:49,340
Nice.

10067
08:17:49,820 --> 08:17:50,480
I'm pushing out.

10068
08:17:50,860 --> 08:17:51,180
Starlord.

10069
08:17:56,140 --> 08:17:56,780
Oh my god.

10070
08:17:57,680 --> 08:17:58,840
Look at Luna on the point.

10071
08:17:59,660 --> 08:18:01,760
I'm pushing up, I'm pushing up onto point with my ult.

10072
08:18:03,360 --> 08:18:04,140
I'm back up, I'm back up, I'm back up.

10073
08:18:04,180 --> 08:18:04,840
I think we have a risk.

10074
08:18:06,320 --> 08:18:07,720
I have my ult out for this, by the way.

10075
08:18:09,440 --> 08:18:11,580
3, 2, 1, backing out now.

10076
08:18:11,580 --> 08:18:13,580
I have my ult.

10077
08:18:14,460 --> 08:18:15,820
On him, on him, on him, on him, on him.

10078
08:18:16,560 --> 08:18:17,480
Look it up, look it up, look it up.

10079
08:18:18,160 --> 08:18:18,940
I'm dead here.

10080
08:18:19,060 --> 08:18:19,400
I'm on him, I'm on him.

10081
08:18:19,700 --> 08:18:21,180
We have to regroup for one last fight.

10082
08:18:22,780 --> 08:18:23,300
Yeah, I'm dead.

10083
08:18:23,900 --> 08:18:24,900
We have one fight left.

10084
08:18:25,100 --> 08:18:25,860
We have no TP.

10085
08:18:28,560 --> 08:18:29,480
Oh my god, that's little.

10086
08:18:30,080 --> 08:18:30,400
Oh!

10087
08:18:31,080 --> 08:18:32,080
I can touch last second.

10088
08:18:32,400 --> 08:18:33,520
You guys wanna wait a bit and group up?

10089
08:18:34,620 --> 08:18:35,080
Yeah, yeah.

10090
08:18:36,940 --> 08:18:38,300
Oh my god, that Venom pick.

10091
08:18:38,860 --> 08:18:39,180
Venom!

10092
08:18:42,240 --> 08:18:43,200
They have strangers.

10093
08:18:43,660 --> 08:18:44,700
Yeah, they do.

10094
08:18:47,800 --> 08:18:49,020
They're still behind me.

10095
08:18:50,360 --> 08:18:51,100
I'm dead.

10096
08:18:55,800 --> 08:18:56,760
I'm fine, I'm fine.

10097
08:18:57,060 --> 08:18:58,400
I have to reload.

10098
08:18:58,420 --> 08:18:58,820
They have strangers.

10099
08:19:00,220 --> 08:19:01,820
I'm burning in two.

10100
08:19:02,740 --> 08:19:03,120
I got one.

10101
08:19:03,980 --> 08:19:04,620
I need to reload.

10102
08:19:07,080 --> 08:19:07,680
Oh!

10103
08:19:08,180 --> 08:19:09,940
We got our point.

10104
08:19:11,940 --> 08:19:12,420
Oh!

10105
08:19:14,100 --> 08:19:15,040
No more...

10106
08:19:15,040 --> 08:19:15,840
Okay, yeah.

10107
08:19:15,900 --> 08:19:17,060
They're no more was insane.

10108
08:19:19,100 --> 08:19:19,780
No.

10109
08:19:20,240 --> 08:19:23,520
We had three DPS and like...

10110
08:19:23,520 --> 08:19:24,480
They can't...

10111
08:19:24,480 --> 08:19:26,560
They're no more literally carry that game.

10112
08:19:27,120 --> 08:19:28,500
It was crazy.

10113
08:19:29,360 --> 08:19:31,940
I can't believe I tripled his support for this.

10114
08:19:35,930 --> 08:19:37,310
I'm stuck in...

10115
08:19:37,310 --> 08:19:39,370
I'm stuck in Purgatory right now.

10116
08:19:39,510 --> 08:19:41,030
I'm literally stuck in...

10117
08:19:41,030 --> 08:19:44,130
I'm stuck in the 90 to 100 Purgatory.

10118
08:19:47,610 --> 08:19:49,130
I'm fucking...

10119
08:19:49,130 --> 08:19:49,570
Oh!

10120
08:19:50,190 --> 08:19:52,410
Get me out of here.

10121
08:19:53,430 --> 08:19:54,430
The elo hell.

10122
08:19:54,550 --> 08:19:56,650
The 90 to 100 elo hell.

10123
08:19:57,210 --> 08:19:58,590
Oh my god.

10124
08:19:59,670 --> 08:20:00,130
It's okay.

10125
08:20:00,350 --> 08:20:01,590
I love Marvel Rivals.

10126
08:20:02,130 --> 08:20:02,950
I fucking...

10127
08:20:04,090 --> 08:20:05,430
Love this game!

10128
08:20:08,090 --> 08:20:09,110
That's true.

10129
08:20:09,410 --> 08:20:11,570
It's called Eternity for a reason.

10130
08:20:12,110 --> 08:20:13,110
And I'm in it.

10131
08:20:13,450 --> 08:20:15,170
I'm fucking in Eternity.

10132
08:20:19,620 --> 08:20:20,660
I love...

10133
08:20:20,660 --> 08:20:21,820
I love Marvel Rivals.

10134
08:20:21,940 --> 08:20:22,340
She is true.

10135
08:20:22,380 --> 08:20:23,260
I am losing it.

10136
08:20:23,640 --> 08:20:24,870
I've been playing for like...

10137
08:20:26,700 --> 08:20:27,880
Eight hours.

10138
08:20:28,160 --> 08:20:29,040
Fucking hell.

10139
08:20:33,400 --> 08:20:34,460
I'm so...

10140
08:20:34,460 --> 08:20:35,780
I'm so strong!

10141
08:20:37,300 --> 08:20:39,580
Guys, 150 is my cutoff today.

10142
08:20:39,840 --> 08:20:41,760
If we hit 150, I'm logging out.

10143
08:20:42,620 --> 08:20:44,700
And then we're going again tomorrow.

10144
08:20:45,200 --> 08:20:46,900
We're going again tomorrow.

10145
08:20:54,300 --> 08:20:55,380
It's okay.

10146
08:20:59,710 --> 08:21:00,950
Oh my god.

10147
08:21:00,990 --> 08:21:03,490
We'll get 150 today.

10148
08:21:04,050 --> 08:21:06,510
God, I hope we get 150 today.

10149
08:21:06,610 --> 08:21:08,530
God, I hope so.

10150
08:21:09,330 --> 08:21:09,750
Wait, wait.

10151
08:21:09,810 --> 08:21:11,010
Don't say that!

10152
08:21:11,650 --> 08:21:13,550
You gotta believe!

10153
08:21:14,590 --> 08:21:15,990
We hit 150 today.

10154
08:21:16,270 --> 08:21:17,410
And then we clock out.

10155
08:21:17,510 --> 08:21:19,310
And we'll try again tomorrow.

10156
08:21:19,790 --> 08:21:21,450
We'll try again tomorrow.

10157
08:21:21,470 --> 08:21:21,930
We'll try again tomorrow.

10158
08:21:23,450 --> 08:21:24,770
I believe.

10159
08:21:25,230 --> 08:21:26,470
You just gotta believe.

10160
08:21:27,190 --> 08:21:28,450
I know I was very...

10161
08:21:28,450 --> 08:21:32,650
I was very overconfident with 200 there.

10162
08:21:33,290 --> 08:21:36,450
I was way too fucking overconfident for it.

10163
08:21:40,210 --> 08:21:41,650
Jesus Christ.

10164
08:21:42,830 --> 08:21:44,330
One second delay.

10165
08:21:50,220 --> 08:21:51,100
I believe.

10166
08:21:51,800 --> 08:21:53,120
It can't be that bad.

10167
08:21:53,600 --> 08:21:55,080
Guys, I believe.

10168
08:21:55,560 --> 08:21:56,560
It cannot be that bad.

10169
08:21:56,820 --> 08:22:00,720
It can't be that bad.

10170
08:22:03,280 --> 08:22:04,640
We can do it.

10171
08:22:05,340 --> 08:22:09,800
We can do it.

10172
08:22:15,360 --> 08:22:17,520
What if we just ban Storm then?

10173
08:22:23,660 --> 08:22:24,240
Alright.

10174
08:22:26,000 --> 08:22:26,920
We can do it.

10175
08:22:30,000 --> 08:22:32,460
What can we play if we can't play Storm?

10176
08:22:38,060 --> 08:22:38,640
Man.

10177
08:22:44,640 --> 08:22:46,020
Can you play Loki?

10178
08:22:46,300 --> 08:22:46,600
No.

10179
08:22:48,240 --> 08:22:50,100
It's not like I don't want to.

10180
08:22:50,140 --> 08:22:50,960
I actually can.

10181
08:22:53,740 --> 08:22:54,720
And I don't...

10182
08:22:55,400 --> 08:22:57,920
I don't have the brain capacity at the moment.

10183
08:22:58,320 --> 08:22:59,600
Well, I've never had one.

10184
08:22:59,740 --> 08:23:03,260
But I definitely don't have the brain capacity to play Loki at my current state.

10185
08:23:07,580 --> 08:23:11,680
In my current state, Loki is not it for me.

10186
08:23:14,900 --> 08:23:18,400
Why does everybody think I'm a Luna one trick?

10187
08:23:18,720 --> 08:23:19,660
Okay, guys.

10188
08:23:19,780 --> 08:23:21,040
I'm not a Luna one trick.

10189
08:23:21,180 --> 08:23:23,380
She's just the best healer at the moment.

10190
08:23:23,380 --> 08:23:24,460
She's the best healer.

10191
08:23:27,120 --> 08:23:30,000
Guys, I can literally play all the other supports except for Loki.

10192
08:23:30,180 --> 08:23:30,960
That's really it.

10193
08:23:31,840 --> 08:23:34,180
I have like a good win rate on Adam.

10194
08:23:35,080 --> 08:23:35,280
Okay.

10195
08:23:35,580 --> 08:23:35,860
JK.

10196
08:23:36,100 --> 08:23:38,760
I can play every support but like Loki.

10197
08:23:39,420 --> 08:23:41,580
And like every time I play Cloak, I lose.

10198
08:23:41,720 --> 08:23:43,260
Because I have a 30% win rate on her.

10199
08:23:43,340 --> 08:23:45,360
But I don't think I'm bad at Cloak.

10200
08:23:45,460 --> 08:23:46,840
I just don't know how to...

10201
08:23:46,840 --> 08:23:47,920
It's just not winnable.

10202
08:23:49,420 --> 08:23:50,620
I can play Rocket.

10203
08:23:51,020 --> 08:23:52,920
It's just anybody can play Rocket.

10204
08:23:52,920 --> 08:23:55,320
People with no fucking hands can play Rocket.

10205
08:24:06,540 --> 08:24:07,980
Oh my god.

10206
08:24:09,740 --> 08:24:11,120
I played Rocket before.

10207
08:24:11,320 --> 08:24:13,660
I played Rocket before people realized he was dog shit.

10208
08:24:15,580 --> 08:24:18,180
Because everyone was like, no, he's so good.

10209
08:24:18,420 --> 08:24:20,860
He's so good because of Punisher.

10210
08:24:23,720 --> 08:24:24,260
Wait.

10211
08:24:24,540 --> 08:24:25,140
Wait a minute.

10212
08:24:25,360 --> 08:24:25,580
Wait.

10213
08:24:25,800 --> 08:24:26,840
This is...

10214
08:24:26,840 --> 08:24:27,800
This is EU.

10215
08:24:32,180 --> 08:24:33,180
This is EU.

10216
08:24:35,940 --> 08:24:36,920
But that's okay.

10217
08:24:37,940 --> 08:24:38,880
Oh, he's so low.

10218
08:24:43,900 --> 08:24:44,780
Oh, Thorlo!

10219
08:24:44,820 --> 08:24:45,920
Thorlo has...

10220
08:24:45,920 --> 08:24:46,020
Grab.

10221
08:24:51,040 --> 08:24:53,080
Oh my god.

10222
08:25:00,460 --> 08:25:01,980
Thor has...

10223
08:25:02,840 --> 08:25:03,600
Guys.

10224
08:25:05,540 --> 08:25:07,500
I know it says one ping.

10225
08:25:07,640 --> 08:25:07,920
Thorlo!

10226
08:25:07,940 --> 08:25:08,600
Thor's so low!

10227
08:25:08,820 --> 08:25:09,060
1v1!

10228
08:25:11,100 --> 08:25:12,920
Oh my god.

10229
08:25:17,480 --> 08:25:18,220
I need to reload.

10230
08:25:18,340 --> 08:25:18,680
I need to...

10231
08:25:18,680 --> 08:25:19,400
Oh, I had to reload.

10232
08:25:19,520 --> 08:25:19,680
Sorry.

10233
08:25:22,860 --> 08:25:23,940
I have ult here too.

10234
08:25:25,200 --> 08:25:25,920
I'm not going to ult you.

10235
08:25:25,980 --> 08:25:26,260
I'm ulting.

10236
08:25:26,320 --> 08:25:26,820
Oh no!

10237
08:25:29,140 --> 08:25:29,900
I didn't think...

10238
08:25:29,900 --> 08:25:30,600
That was my bad.

10239
08:25:39,720 --> 08:25:41,060
That was my bad.

10240
08:25:47,380 --> 08:25:48,140
I have to reload.

10241
08:25:48,140 --> 08:25:49,980
What the fuck?

10242
08:25:53,450 --> 08:25:54,970
Oh my god.

10243
08:25:55,710 --> 08:25:58,310
I need an ult faster there.

10244
08:25:58,510 --> 08:25:59,170
I need to remember.

10245
08:26:00,050 --> 08:26:00,350
Magneto!

10246
08:26:00,410 --> 08:26:00,630
Magneto!

10247
08:26:00,670 --> 08:26:01,110
Magneto one!

10248
08:26:02,350 --> 08:26:04,130
We can push up with that.

10249
08:26:06,050 --> 08:26:06,970
To the right!

10250
08:26:07,350 --> 08:26:07,750
Wolverine!

10251
08:26:07,910 --> 08:26:08,030
Wolverine!

10252
08:26:08,270 --> 08:26:08,850
I'm ulting.

10253
08:26:11,050 --> 08:26:11,650
Oh,

10254
08:26:14,870 --> 08:26:16,130
there's a Thor right behind us.

10255
08:26:16,130 --> 08:26:16,670
Thor!

10256
08:26:16,970 --> 08:26:17,110
Thor!

10257
08:26:17,230 --> 08:26:17,230
Thor!

10258
08:26:17,330 --> 08:26:17,470
Thor!

10259
08:26:17,790 --> 08:26:19,190
Hold it.

10260
08:26:19,270 --> 08:26:19,430
Hold it.

10261
08:26:20,250 --> 08:26:20,850
Nice.

10262
08:26:21,910 --> 08:26:22,870
Oh my god.

10263
08:26:23,310 --> 08:26:24,230
Oh my god.

10264
08:26:25,210 --> 08:26:26,250
Oh, my one ping.

10265
08:26:29,450 --> 08:26:31,990
My one ping is working as intended.

10266
08:26:34,710 --> 08:26:35,190
Watch out, Thor.

10267
08:26:35,290 --> 08:26:40,270
The one ping right there.

10268
08:26:42,830 --> 08:26:44,110
Both tanks are up right by you.

10269
08:26:44,970 --> 08:26:46,070
It's dead.

10270
08:26:48,770 --> 08:26:49,410
Okay.

10271
08:26:53,870 --> 08:26:56,270
It feels like I have ping-ish.

10272
08:26:56,570 --> 08:26:57,870
Like, no, it can't be.

10273
08:26:58,490 --> 08:27:02,370
It feels like the game is being played by 10 frames left.

10274
08:27:04,810 --> 08:27:05,850
Wolverines have.

10275
08:27:07,470 --> 08:27:08,570
Thor's have too.

10276
08:27:12,110 --> 08:27:13,550
We need to be on point.

10277
08:27:13,550 --> 08:27:14,010
I'm on point.

10278
08:27:15,450 --> 08:27:15,950
I'm on point.

10279
08:27:20,550 --> 08:27:21,270
I'm okay.

10280
08:27:23,070 --> 08:27:24,590
There's a Thor right behind me.

10281
08:27:28,370 --> 08:27:29,170
I'm on wolf.

10282
08:27:29,270 --> 08:27:29,710
I'm on wolf.

10283
08:27:29,890 --> 08:27:30,570
Wolf is low.

10284
08:27:34,470 --> 08:27:35,190
Jesus Christ.

10285
08:27:37,370 --> 08:27:38,350
Magneto top left.

10286
08:27:39,050 --> 08:27:39,530
He's half.

10287
08:27:41,230 --> 08:27:42,070
Guys, no.

10288
08:27:42,290 --> 08:27:43,730
It's just one ping.

10289
08:27:44,430 --> 08:27:45,610
Magneto's so low.

10290
08:27:46,850 --> 08:27:47,770
You're so fine.

10291
08:27:48,390 --> 08:27:49,650
You're so healthy.

10292
08:27:50,710 --> 08:27:51,570
No, guys.

10293
08:27:51,610 --> 08:27:52,270
I'm one ping.

10294
08:27:56,450 --> 08:27:59,390
It's working as fucking intended.

10295
08:28:01,830 --> 08:28:03,230
Guys, is it noticeable?

10296
08:28:06,050 --> 08:28:06,730
Where's Thor?

10297
08:28:06,810 --> 08:28:07,210
Where's Thor?

10298
08:28:07,430 --> 08:28:08,310
Oh, he's healed.

10299
08:28:08,370 --> 08:28:08,650
He's healed.

10300
08:28:11,470 --> 08:28:12,930
Guys, is it obvious?

10301
08:28:13,210 --> 08:28:14,290
Nah, right?

10302
08:28:34,100 --> 08:28:35,620
What happened?

10303
08:28:36,400 --> 08:28:37,160
Guys,

10304
08:28:41,940 --> 08:28:42,960
do you think it's noticeable?

10305
08:28:43,480 --> 08:28:45,660
That's not a one ping there.

10306
08:28:50,400 --> 08:28:51,120
No, right?

10307
08:28:51,320 --> 08:28:51,520
No.

10308
08:28:59,480 --> 08:28:59,840
Chill.

10309
08:29:03,360 --> 08:29:03,660
Chill.

10310
08:29:03,740 --> 08:29:04,960
I had to use it.

10311
08:29:05,160 --> 08:29:06,060
He hooked me in.

10312
08:29:07,840 --> 08:29:08,700
Oh, you're using it?

10313
08:29:08,880 --> 08:29:09,060
Yeah.

10314
08:29:09,140 --> 08:29:09,800
No, he hooked me in.

10315
08:29:09,900 --> 08:29:10,360
He hooked me in.

10316
08:29:10,360 --> 08:29:10,900
He's pushing.

10317
08:29:10,900 --> 08:29:11,360
He's pushing.

10318
08:29:23,940 --> 08:29:24,460
Thor!

10319
08:29:24,460 --> 08:29:24,980
Thor!

10320
08:29:24,980 --> 08:29:25,260
Thor!

10321
08:29:25,360 --> 08:29:25,620
Thor!

10322
08:29:27,400 --> 08:29:28,440
Thor's still on point.

10323
08:29:29,140 --> 08:29:29,560
Thor's one.

10324
08:29:29,640 --> 08:29:30,120
Thor's one.

10325
08:29:34,380 --> 08:29:34,900
Fetch.

10326
08:29:37,300 --> 08:29:38,060
Wait, Psylocke!

10327
08:29:38,580 --> 08:29:39,100
Psylocke!

10328
08:29:39,100 --> 08:29:40,240
Psylocke, how about money with Psylocke?

10329
08:29:41,380 --> 08:29:41,980
What?

10330
08:29:48,220 --> 08:29:51,960
Guys, I think it's like one and a half ping.

10331
08:29:55,080 --> 08:29:56,580
Guys, you're right.

10332
08:29:56,720 --> 08:29:58,160
Guys, it's not one ping.

10333
08:29:58,420 --> 08:29:59,100
It was actually...

10334
08:30:01,740 --> 08:30:02,340
Two.

10335
08:30:03,160 --> 08:30:03,160
Two.

10336
08:30:05,640 --> 08:30:06,880
Guys, you're right.

10337
08:30:07,040 --> 08:30:08,440
This feels like two ping.

10338
08:30:08,440 --> 08:30:10,720
This doesn't feel like a one.

10339
08:30:12,040 --> 08:30:13,040
Oh, man.

10340
08:30:13,100 --> 08:30:15,800
That two ping's hitting fucking hard right now.

10341
08:30:15,880 --> 08:30:17,500
It's hitting so hard.

10342
08:30:22,420 --> 08:30:25,360
I knew it.

10343
08:30:25,460 --> 08:30:26,400
That hundred ping.

10344
08:30:26,420 --> 08:30:27,720
That hundred percent increase.

10345
08:30:29,020 --> 08:30:31,080
That was double the ping in there.

10346
08:30:33,060 --> 08:30:33,740
What?

10347
08:30:35,560 --> 08:30:36,500
Oh, okay.

10348
08:30:38,440 --> 08:30:38,920
Oh, my God.

10349
08:30:39,100 --> 08:30:40,740
That two ping is crazy.

10350
08:30:41,560 --> 08:30:42,720
You're right, guys.

10351
08:30:43,280 --> 08:30:45,420
I feel the two ping right there.

10352
08:30:47,080 --> 08:30:49,440
I see the landing in like five days.

10353
08:30:50,180 --> 08:30:52,040
I think like four and a half now.

10354
08:30:52,900 --> 08:30:53,300
Technically.

10355
08:31:10,740 --> 08:31:11,680
Oh, my God.

10356
08:31:12,220 --> 08:31:13,340
There was nothing I could do.

10357
08:31:14,340 --> 08:31:17,000
There's still a change in front of us.

10358
08:31:19,840 --> 08:31:20,340
I'm asleep.

10359
08:31:20,440 --> 08:31:20,660
I'm asleep.

10360
08:31:20,720 --> 08:31:21,240
We have no heals.

10361
08:31:24,020 --> 08:31:25,740
Oh, there's no more pushing me.

10362
08:31:30,100 --> 08:31:33,500
Oh, it looks like three to me.

10363
08:31:34,920 --> 08:31:36,840
I'm back in the fight.

10364
08:31:36,880 --> 08:31:39,900
You're complaining about two ping.

10365
08:31:42,860 --> 08:31:44,180
Yeah, I am.

10366
08:31:44,720 --> 08:31:45,160
Yeah.

10367
08:31:46,480 --> 08:31:47,360
Goddamn.

10368
08:31:47,500 --> 08:31:48,540
Of course I am.

10369
08:31:49,420 --> 08:31:51,360
God, two ping is so unplayable.

10370
08:31:51,920 --> 08:31:53,660
It's so unplayable.

10371
08:31:53,660 --> 08:31:54,080
It's so unplayable.

10372
08:31:56,220 --> 08:31:56,860
Oh.

10373
08:32:05,440 --> 08:32:07,400
You guys are so healthy.

10374
08:32:10,000 --> 08:32:11,660
Oh, you guys are...

10375
08:32:12,360 --> 08:32:13,080
Can you reload?

10376
08:32:15,560 --> 08:32:16,200
I'm fine.

10377
08:32:16,300 --> 08:32:16,440
I'm fine.

10378
08:32:19,360 --> 08:32:20,680
I can't see you over there.

10379
08:32:25,700 --> 08:32:27,580
Oh, I didn't got reset.

10380
08:32:31,360 --> 08:32:32,840
Oh, my God.

10381
08:32:43,200 --> 08:32:45,600
Are you guys okay over there?

10382
08:32:46,440 --> 08:32:47,740
Why the fuck are we fighting?

10383
08:32:47,920 --> 08:32:48,120
Oh.

10384
08:32:49,060 --> 08:32:50,800
I was gonna say, why are we here?

10385
08:32:51,820 --> 08:32:52,420
Okay.

10386
08:32:52,980 --> 08:32:54,500
I won't ask questions.

10387
08:32:57,860 --> 08:33:00,700
Oh, I'm ulting for you.

10388
08:33:02,840 --> 08:33:04,280
Alright, we got scared.

10389
08:33:08,020 --> 08:33:11,100
Alright, two, one.

10390
08:33:15,120 --> 08:33:16,280
I'm dead here.

10391
08:33:16,420 --> 08:33:17,660
There's a Magneto on me.

10392
08:33:18,960 --> 08:33:20,720
Okay, maybe we can get them.

10393
08:33:22,860 --> 08:33:23,400
Oh,

10394
08:33:26,840 --> 08:33:29,540
I had two people walk up to me.

10395
08:33:31,340 --> 08:33:32,200
Nah, they used way too much.

10396
08:33:34,380 --> 08:33:36,140
They used more on there.

10397
08:33:38,560 --> 08:33:41,640
Oh, my God, please.

10398
08:33:41,780 --> 08:33:42,320
Waluigi.

10399
08:33:47,660 --> 08:33:48,220
Waluigi.

10400
08:33:48,240 --> 08:33:48,940
Waluigi, what are you doing?

10401
08:33:50,380 --> 08:33:51,160
Listen, listen, listen.

10402
08:33:51,500 --> 08:33:52,300
I'm gonna press Q.

10403
08:33:54,180 --> 08:33:54,740
Okay.

10404
08:34:00,600 --> 08:34:02,140
You disagree with me?

10405
08:34:03,780 --> 08:34:06,420
Oh, what are you thinking?

10406
08:34:07,360 --> 08:34:09,020
Oh, what are you thinking?

10407
08:34:11,180 --> 08:34:12,320
What are you thinking?

10408
08:34:15,960 --> 08:34:16,760
Should I?

10409
08:34:17,460 --> 08:34:19,740
No, no, no, no.

10410
08:34:19,760 --> 08:34:20,580
Chat, type one.

10411
08:34:20,600 --> 08:34:21,620
Chat, type one if I press Q.

10412
08:34:22,080 --> 08:34:22,620
Oh, my God.

10413
08:34:23,620 --> 08:34:26,220
I need to win this game because it's the final.

10414
08:34:27,200 --> 08:34:29,000
Wait, Ryo, log in.

10415
08:34:30,080 --> 08:34:31,340
Oh, Ryo, log in.

10416
08:34:31,540 --> 08:34:33,280
Guys, my brain is not working anymore.

10417
08:34:33,480 --> 08:34:35,800
I'm like, my brain is only Marvel Rivals.

10418
08:34:36,140 --> 08:34:39,220
It's just I close my eyes and it's Marvel Rivals.

10419
08:34:39,360 --> 08:34:41,900
I open my eyes, I'm in Marvel Rivals right now.

10420
08:34:45,560 --> 08:34:46,040
150.

10421
08:34:48,200 --> 08:34:51,640
We can get back to- We can- 150 is the cap.

10422
08:34:52,400 --> 08:34:53,940
We get to 150.

10423
08:34:57,760 --> 08:34:59,140
People top left, watch out.

10424
08:35:00,140 --> 08:35:02,140
Please, just look at me.

10425
08:35:02,600 --> 08:35:03,420
Look at me.

10426
08:35:05,980 --> 08:35:07,200
Look at me.

10427
08:35:11,000 --> 08:35:12,240
Look at me.

10428
08:35:16,260 --> 08:35:17,600
Change is low, change is one.

10429
08:35:19,400 --> 08:35:20,860
There's somebody behind us.

10430
08:35:20,960 --> 08:35:21,860
There's a Bucky behind us.

10431
08:35:26,980 --> 08:35:27,940
We lost our low key.

10432
08:35:34,120 --> 08:35:34,920
You're only solo healing.

10433
08:35:35,060 --> 08:35:35,280
I'm solo healing.

10434
08:35:36,620 --> 08:35:37,320
I froze him too.

10435
08:35:37,380 --> 08:35:37,920
I froze him too.

10436
08:35:43,200 --> 08:35:43,800
Is this winnable?

10437
08:35:43,920 --> 08:35:45,000
I can ult this if we need it.

10438
08:35:45,240 --> 08:35:46,020
No, no, we don't need it.

10439
08:35:46,040 --> 08:35:46,340
We don't need it.

10440
08:35:46,380 --> 08:35:46,780
We don't need it.

10441
08:35:56,220 --> 08:36:00,180
I'll put it on you.

10442
08:36:01,300 --> 08:36:02,720
I need heals here.

10443
08:36:11,020 --> 08:36:12,320
Oh my god.

10444
08:36:12,740 --> 08:36:13,520
I'm so locked.

10445
08:36:13,840 --> 08:36:15,080
I'm locked in right now.

10446
08:36:19,680 --> 08:36:20,520
He's low, he's low.

10447
08:36:20,960 --> 08:36:22,000
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

10448
08:36:22,360 --> 08:36:23,440
I got it all, I got it all.

10449
08:36:26,980 --> 08:36:27,500
Who's going to scan?

10450
08:36:27,580 --> 08:36:27,900
Who's going to scan?

10451
08:36:28,880 --> 08:36:31,680
I'm going to follow our... I'm following our...

10452
08:36:35,660 --> 08:36:37,660
I froze Mantis, I froze Mantis.

10453
08:36:44,360 --> 08:36:45,960
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

10454
08:36:49,420 --> 08:36:50,580
Our low key is close ult.

10455
08:36:51,880 --> 08:36:52,940
We need to keep alive.

10456
08:36:53,600 --> 08:36:55,740
Our low key is ult, our low key is ult.

10457
08:36:57,720 --> 08:36:59,020
I don't need, I don't need.

10458
08:36:59,340 --> 08:37:02,020
Just come back, come back.

10459
08:37:06,530 --> 08:37:07,910
Oh my god.

10460
08:37:11,150 --> 08:37:12,610
I froze somebody.

10461
08:37:19,190 --> 08:37:20,770
They are at the top left.

10462
08:37:27,780 --> 08:37:30,780
I froze him, I froze him, I froze him, I froze him.

10463
08:37:31,080 --> 08:37:37,340
I don't have ult here.

10464
08:37:39,080 --> 08:37:40,720
We're even, we're even, we're even.

10465
08:37:42,280 --> 08:37:43,340
I'm going to ult in here.

10466
08:37:44,720 --> 08:37:45,800
Support, support is back.

10467
08:37:46,360 --> 08:37:47,200
Luna low, Luna low.

10468
08:37:48,320 --> 08:37:49,080
Oh that's ours.

10469
08:37:51,600 --> 08:37:52,000
Whoops.

10470
08:37:52,340 --> 08:37:53,080
I'm on the...

10471
08:37:53,080 --> 08:37:53,740
Let's change.

10472
08:37:57,800 --> 08:37:58,580
I'm in the back.

10473
08:37:58,900 --> 08:37:59,780
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

10474
08:38:03,940 --> 08:38:04,740
I'm reloading.

10475
08:38:04,940 --> 08:38:05,940
No more one, no more one.

10476
08:38:07,780 --> 08:38:11,420
I can never tell if it's our Namoor or the enemy Namoor.

10477
08:38:11,680 --> 08:38:15,540
Like I can't, I can't, I always like, I always freak out.

10478
08:38:16,720 --> 08:38:18,160
They're pulling, they're pulling.

10479
08:38:19,160 --> 08:38:20,000
They're behind, they're behind.

10480
08:38:20,820 --> 08:38:21,600
They might take the high ground.

10481
08:38:22,440 --> 08:38:24,280
Flip the map, flip the map, be careful.

10482
08:38:25,900 --> 08:38:26,800
I can't tell.

10483
08:38:28,100 --> 08:38:29,860
It like freaks me out.

10484
08:38:40,340 --> 08:38:42,200
We have to get on point here.

10485
08:38:43,160 --> 08:38:46,100
I have ult here, we can...

10486
08:38:46,100 --> 08:38:47,660
I'm ulting here, I'm ulting here.

10487
08:38:52,820 --> 08:38:55,580
I live, I live, I live, I live.

10488
08:38:55,900 --> 08:38:57,460
I live, I live, I live.

10489
08:38:57,740 --> 08:38:59,780
3, 2, 1, I have to back up.

10490
08:39:00,480 --> 08:39:01,520
Mag is frozen.

10491
08:39:02,060 --> 08:39:03,400
But she's looking for me, she's looking for me.

10492
08:39:06,600 --> 08:39:09,100
We have to stay on point.

10493
08:39:09,480 --> 08:39:11,440
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.

10494
08:39:11,800 --> 08:39:12,400
I cannot do anything.

10495
08:39:12,800 --> 08:39:14,060
I might be dead then, yeah.

10496
08:39:15,960 --> 08:39:17,580
We have to follow up for the next fight, by the way.

10497
08:39:17,700 --> 08:39:19,060
It's really good, they have no spoilers.

10498
08:39:20,360 --> 08:39:21,920
Keep the orb on her, Starlord.

10499
08:39:22,520 --> 08:39:24,620
No more stagger, though.

10500
08:39:38,020 --> 08:39:39,460
We have low health soon.

10501
08:39:49,240 --> 08:39:49,820
I'm dead.

10502
08:39:52,020 --> 08:39:57,260
I froze it, but that's all I could do.

10503
08:40:03,680 --> 08:40:04,320
Oh, no!

10504
08:40:05,460 --> 08:40:07,700
The voices, the voices are speaking to me, the voices are speaking to me, the voices, the voices, the voices.

10505
08:40:10,300 --> 08:40:10,620
No!

10506
08:40:11,060 --> 08:40:13,420
You just lost the finals, Heelys.

10507
08:40:13,460 --> 08:40:14,200
I hope you realize this.

10508
08:40:21,460 --> 08:40:23,220
It's that two ping.

10509
08:40:24,040 --> 08:40:26,220
It's the two ping.

10510
08:40:28,200 --> 08:40:29,880
It's the two ping.

10511
08:40:30,640 --> 08:40:32,820
I blame the two ping, guys.

10512
08:40:33,040 --> 08:40:34,820
I blame the two ping.

10513
08:40:36,320 --> 08:40:37,600
Oh, my God.

10514
08:40:38,220 --> 08:40:40,260
Guys, we can do it.

10515
08:40:40,380 --> 08:40:40,980
I believe.

10516
08:40:42,080 --> 08:40:44,700
It's 11, oh my God.

10517
08:40:44,840 --> 08:40:47,700
The fact that our record's 11-11.

10518
08:40:47,700 --> 08:40:51,020
I'm gonna freak out.

10519
08:40:53,620 --> 08:40:55,000
No, I'm not back.

10520
08:40:55,480 --> 08:40:58,100
I started at 66.

10521
08:40:59,440 --> 08:41:01,940
I started at 66.

10522
08:41:05,320 --> 08:41:08,720
Our target is 150.

10523
08:41:29,800 --> 08:41:31,320
That's actually really good.

10524
08:41:31,640 --> 08:41:32,320
Can we ban Punisher?

10525
08:41:32,780 --> 08:41:33,880
We can ban Punisher.

10526
08:41:42,260 --> 08:41:42,600
Oh, no.

10527
08:41:43,820 --> 08:41:44,220
No way.

10528
08:41:45,160 --> 08:41:46,880
August is gone.

10529
08:41:47,320 --> 08:41:49,140
It's time for September.

10530
08:41:55,650 --> 08:41:57,190
Oh, sorry, I'm muted.

10531
08:41:57,770 --> 08:41:59,090
Sorry, as I was saying.

10532
08:42:00,430 --> 08:42:01,090
I closed my eyes.

10533
08:42:02,590 --> 08:42:03,690
It's Marvel Rivals.

10534
08:42:03,810 --> 08:42:06,650
I opened my eyes.

10535
08:42:06,950 --> 08:42:07,930
It's Marvel Rivals.

10536
08:42:08,630 --> 08:42:10,530
I love Marvel Rivals.

10537
08:42:10,730 --> 08:42:14,250
I'll leave my assets to Marvel Rivals.

10538
08:42:14,710 --> 08:42:15,830
It's in my will.

10539
08:42:17,030 --> 08:42:19,930
God, I fucking love Marvel Rivals.

10540
08:42:21,750 --> 08:42:23,530
Someone teased me.

10541
08:42:28,550 --> 08:42:30,650
Thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

10542
08:42:30,750 --> 08:42:31,430
Thank you, thank you.

10543
08:42:31,470 --> 08:42:32,850
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

10544
08:42:33,010 --> 08:42:34,130
Thank you, thank you.

10545
08:42:34,530 --> 08:42:36,290
Alright, 150 is our target.

10546
08:42:36,290 --> 08:42:42,470
If we get 150, we fucking clock out.

10547
08:42:42,870 --> 08:42:44,290
We clock out.

10548
08:42:45,790 --> 08:42:48,270
We clock out at 150.

10549
08:42:48,850 --> 08:42:49,370
Surely not.

10550
08:42:50,730 --> 08:42:52,190
I don't believe it.

10551
08:42:52,250 --> 08:42:53,290
I'm praying for his return.

10552
08:42:53,790 --> 08:42:55,670
I belong to Marvel Rivals now.

10553
08:42:55,830 --> 08:42:56,610
They own me.

10554
08:42:57,050 --> 08:42:59,610
They own my entire existence.

10555
08:43:04,630 --> 08:43:06,790
I love Marvel Rivals.

10556
08:43:08,810 --> 08:43:09,710
It's 7am.

10557
08:43:10,130 --> 08:43:11,610
It's 7am.

10558
08:43:11,990 --> 08:43:16,210
I have to, like, walk my dog after this.

10559
08:43:16,470 --> 08:43:21,350
At this point, I'm gonna play so much that I gotta walk the dog.

10560
08:43:22,790 --> 08:43:23,770
Is he coming back?

10561
08:43:25,790 --> 08:43:27,970
I would be so sad.

10562
08:43:29,870 --> 08:43:31,210
You fucking tryhards.

10563
08:43:33,150 --> 08:43:34,470
There's only...

10564
08:43:34,470 --> 08:43:37,070
There's nearly only...

10565
08:43:37,070 --> 08:43:38,790
You fucking tryhard.

10566
08:43:38,850 --> 08:43:39,430
You nerd.

10567
08:43:40,850 --> 08:43:43,070
You're such a nerd.

10568
08:43:48,030 --> 08:43:49,770
You're such a nerd.

10569
08:43:55,970 --> 08:43:58,150
You're such a nerd.

10570
08:44:03,070 --> 08:44:04,850
You're so bad.

10571
08:44:05,750 --> 08:44:07,030
I'm coming for you.

10572
08:44:09,610 --> 08:44:11,090
Oh my god.

10573
08:44:11,210 --> 08:44:12,650
How are you losing?

10574
08:44:14,770 --> 08:44:17,070
How are you losing a 5v6?

10575
08:44:17,890 --> 08:44:18,690
How?

10576
08:44:21,850 --> 08:44:23,550
Come back.

10577
08:44:28,170 --> 08:44:30,990
Oh my god.

10578
08:44:31,550 --> 08:44:33,890
He never came back.

10579
08:44:34,490 --> 08:44:35,090
Bro.

10580
08:44:35,430 --> 08:44:37,550
He never came back.

10581
08:44:37,850 --> 08:44:39,890
Why didn't he come back?

10582
08:44:44,210 --> 08:44:46,050
Why didn't he come back?

10583
08:44:46,510 --> 08:44:47,610
I'm sorry, Tony Florida.

10584
08:44:47,910 --> 08:44:49,970
Like, I can't have you in my life.

10585
08:44:50,430 --> 08:44:51,810
Oh, who is this guy?

10586
08:44:53,030 --> 08:44:54,430
Who is Jimbo Limbo?

10587
08:44:54,910 --> 08:44:56,510
Who the fuck is Jimbo Limbo?

10588
08:44:58,110 --> 08:45:00,250
I have no idea who they are.

10589
08:45:01,210 --> 08:45:01,790
You're right.

10590
08:45:01,790 --> 08:45:03,010
Cause I'm at 2 ping.

10591
08:45:03,150 --> 08:45:03,710
You're right.

10592
08:45:04,230 --> 08:45:07,710
It's all because me being at 2 ping.

10593
08:45:10,200 --> 08:45:11,360
Who's Jimbo Limbo?

10594
08:45:14,260 --> 08:45:15,500
My mental check.

10595
08:45:15,960 --> 08:45:17,880
It's not been okay for a while.

10596
08:45:19,840 --> 08:45:23,380
Since I started playing Marvel Rivals.

10597
08:45:28,510 --> 08:45:30,330
I'm not dead inside.

10598
08:45:30,750 --> 08:45:33,090
I'm just...

10599
08:45:33,090 --> 08:45:36,290
I'm just Marvel Rivaling.

10600
08:45:37,050 --> 08:45:39,170
It's just my existence.

10601
08:45:47,650 --> 08:45:49,490
Please, walk dad.

10602
08:45:49,630 --> 08:45:55,090
The fresh air will give me the strength to hit top 500.

10603
08:45:57,970 --> 08:45:58,890
My god.

10604
08:46:00,630 --> 08:46:01,470
I believe.

10605
08:46:02,130 --> 08:46:03,490
I believe.

10606
08:46:09,230 --> 08:46:10,370
Do we just ban?

10607
08:46:11,710 --> 08:46:12,470
Hello, Loki.

10608
08:46:16,990 --> 08:46:18,030
Thank you!

10609
08:46:20,450 --> 08:46:21,890
I really appreciate it.

10610
08:46:23,010 --> 08:46:24,410
No, it's not his walkie's time.

10611
08:46:24,530 --> 08:46:25,870
I might feed him in an hour though.

10612
08:46:26,930 --> 08:46:28,430
It's not his walkie's time yet.

10613
08:46:28,710 --> 08:46:30,050
I'll let them figure out the bans.

10614
08:46:30,130 --> 08:46:31,750
I've stopped...

10615
08:46:31,750 --> 08:46:32,010
thinking.

10616
08:46:33,390 --> 08:46:36,030
I can literally play Luna on autopilot now.

10617
08:46:36,030 --> 08:46:38,230
This is your smurf, you can chill.

10618
08:46:38,310 --> 08:46:39,350
This is not his smurf.

10619
08:46:39,470 --> 08:46:40,870
This is his actual account.

10620
08:46:42,470 --> 08:46:43,890
Like, what do you mean?

10621
08:46:47,910 --> 08:46:50,230
That's literally his actual account.

10622
08:46:58,350 --> 08:47:00,350
I can't believe we're back where we started.

10623
08:47:01,310 --> 08:47:02,670
I can't believe it.

10624
08:47:05,790 --> 08:47:07,830
I can't believe it actually.

10625
08:47:11,810 --> 08:47:13,330
Oh my god.

10626
08:47:15,450 --> 08:47:19,730
Have we won an Ironman Hulk matchup yet?

10627
08:47:20,390 --> 08:47:21,310
We have him.

10628
08:47:22,010 --> 08:47:23,850
We have a man with no hands.

10629
08:47:26,370 --> 08:47:29,810
Have we ever won...

10630
08:47:31,630 --> 08:47:32,770
Have we...

10631
08:47:32,770 --> 08:47:36,750
My chat said we haven't won an Ironman Hulk game yet.

10632
08:47:38,230 --> 08:47:39,810
That is because...

10633
08:47:40,790 --> 08:47:41,270
Because...

10634
08:47:41,270 --> 08:47:43,030
We have Felix inting.

10635
08:47:46,250 --> 08:47:47,650
But your chat...

10636
08:47:47,650 --> 08:47:49,290
Your chat will be wrong now.

10637
08:47:49,690 --> 08:47:51,650
Because this is the game where we win.

10638
08:47:51,870 --> 08:47:52,770
The Ironman Hulk.

10639
08:47:53,370 --> 08:47:54,910
I keep popping off on the Hulk.

10640
08:47:55,050 --> 08:47:56,590
My team keeps getting diffed, okay?

10641
08:47:57,110 --> 08:47:58,710
This time, my team isn't getting diffed.

10642
08:47:59,410 --> 08:48:01,230
I'm gonna pull the weight of everyone.

10643
08:48:03,450 --> 08:48:05,270
I've finally warmed up.

10644
08:48:05,430 --> 08:48:07,590
After 8 hours of gaming, I'm warm.

10645
08:48:07,590 --> 08:48:08,230
I'm ready.

10646
08:48:12,090 --> 08:48:15,050
Put your trust on me.

10647
08:48:16,130 --> 08:48:19,170
Also, your chat has probably never won a game ever.

10648
08:48:22,850 --> 08:48:24,530
Isn't Helios in my chat?

10649
08:48:25,510 --> 08:48:26,790
Wait, Helios is in my chat.

10650
08:48:39,340 --> 08:48:41,500
But Helios is in my chat.

10651
08:48:42,020 --> 08:48:43,480
That affects me.

10652
08:48:43,920 --> 08:48:45,020
Wait, they have a Hawkeye.

10653
08:48:49,340 --> 08:48:54,040
Hulk is behind us.

10654
08:48:57,100 --> 08:48:58,080
Oh, we lost.

10655
08:48:58,260 --> 08:48:58,980
Punish you.

10656
08:49:04,120 --> 08:49:06,620
I have to back up.

10657
08:49:09,340 --> 08:49:11,300
This portal is not my creation.

10658
08:49:15,060 --> 08:49:16,740
There's a Strange on the supports.

10659
08:49:18,000 --> 08:49:19,440
And a Hulk on supports too.

10660
08:49:19,980 --> 08:49:20,940
Hulk is half.

10661
08:49:23,640 --> 08:49:25,340
Luna by herself to the left.

10662
08:49:30,700 --> 08:49:32,020
I got you.

10663
08:49:33,960 --> 08:49:35,760
This is the win, guys.

10664
08:49:36,800 --> 08:49:37,440
Is this it?

10665
08:49:37,440 --> 08:49:38,340
Is this the win?

10666
08:49:38,820 --> 08:49:40,080
Haven't lost today.

10667
08:49:42,180 --> 08:49:44,720
We're on an 11 game win streak, right?

10668
08:49:45,860 --> 08:49:46,700
We're 11-11.

10669
08:49:47,280 --> 08:49:48,300
Yeah, I know.

10670
08:49:49,660 --> 08:49:54,100
To be fair, our win rate drastically dropped after adding one player.

10671
08:49:55,160 --> 08:49:56,280
Who added him?

10672
08:50:03,980 --> 08:50:05,660
I froze Hulk too.

10673
08:50:07,920 --> 08:50:08,900
Please, I need help.

10674
08:50:10,580 --> 08:50:11,760
I'm 1 HP.

10675
08:50:15,680 --> 08:50:16,640
I can't.

10676
08:50:16,700 --> 08:50:17,900
Oh, they double support.

10677
08:50:19,940 --> 08:50:25,660
I'm trying to keep our Strange up.

10678
08:50:28,700 --> 08:50:30,080
There's an Iron Man.

10679
08:50:30,560 --> 08:50:31,280
Iron Man on me.

10680
08:50:46,960 --> 08:50:47,920
I can't.

10681
08:50:47,920 --> 08:50:48,600
This is fine.

10682
08:50:53,320 --> 08:50:55,360
I can't do this on YouTube.

10683
08:50:55,980 --> 08:51:00,920
I can't do it on YouTube.

10684
08:51:01,940 --> 08:51:03,740
There's a Hulk right in front of us.

10685
08:51:03,800 --> 08:51:05,440
Guys, there's a Hulk on point.

10686
08:51:10,440 --> 08:51:11,980
That two ping is way too much.

10687
08:51:12,500 --> 08:51:13,460
That two ping.

10688
08:51:14,500 --> 08:51:14,720
No!

10689
08:51:19,580 --> 08:51:21,020
Rocket heals.

10690
08:51:22,160 --> 08:51:23,440
I'm gonna kill them all.

10691
08:51:26,180 --> 08:51:29,760
Guys, I can't.

10692
08:51:30,120 --> 08:51:33,440
If I had one ping, it would've been so different.

10693
08:51:34,380 --> 08:51:38,640
It would've been so different.

10694
08:51:40,440 --> 08:51:42,460
If I was on one ping, guys.

10695
08:51:50,180 --> 08:51:51,620
Oh, Grimad.

10696
08:51:55,380 --> 08:51:57,280
He lost him!

10697
08:52:02,540 --> 08:52:04,460
I can ult on point.

10698
08:52:06,400 --> 08:52:07,900
I'm ulting on point.

10699
08:52:10,440 --> 08:52:11,160
Oh, it's okay.

10700
08:52:13,260 --> 08:52:18,280
I'm okay, I'm okay.

10701
08:52:18,420 --> 08:52:19,400
I got off.

10702
08:52:22,100 --> 08:52:24,040
Oh my god, little guy!

10703
08:52:24,620 --> 08:52:25,360
Oh my god!

10704
08:52:27,060 --> 08:52:28,080
Little bruise!

10705
08:52:28,240 --> 08:52:29,280
Bruise is one!

10706
08:52:29,280 --> 08:52:29,780
Bruise is one!

10707
08:52:31,380 --> 08:52:35,420
You guys thought I was throwing, but I was setting us up.

10708
08:52:35,980 --> 08:52:37,640
Nice show!

10709
08:52:41,860 --> 08:52:43,560
We haven't won yet.

10710
08:52:43,840 --> 08:52:44,680
We haven't won yet.

10711
08:52:44,900 --> 08:52:46,040
That's true, that's true.

10712
08:52:54,980 --> 08:52:55,460
That's true, that's true.

10713
08:52:55,460 --> 08:52:56,660
The fake throw.

10714
08:52:56,780 --> 08:52:58,960
We baited them into thinking we're throwing.

10715
08:52:59,400 --> 08:53:01,400
So they went in overconfident.

10716
08:53:01,680 --> 08:53:02,740
And then we did it.

10717
08:53:03,960 --> 08:53:05,420
Jankos doesn't lose.

10718
08:53:05,660 --> 08:53:06,960
Kat loses.

10719
08:53:13,540 --> 08:53:15,400
Also, Ham, thank you for tier 1 sub.

10720
08:53:15,440 --> 08:53:16,480
Thank you, Kat.

10721
08:53:16,480 --> 08:53:18,420
Also, thank you for the 200 bitties.

10722
08:53:18,520 --> 08:53:19,660
Thank you, thank you.

10723
08:53:20,140 --> 08:53:22,160
Also, thank you again for the 100 bitties.

10724
08:53:22,320 --> 08:53:24,040
When you walk down, you will see me.

10725
08:53:25,860 --> 08:53:26,740
Marvel Rivalry.

10726
08:53:29,860 --> 08:53:31,520
My head is like so mush.

10727
08:53:31,620 --> 08:53:34,380
It's so hard to figure out what the fuck I'm comming about anymore.

10728
08:53:34,900 --> 08:53:36,380
Oh my god, we're on a hype train!

10729
08:53:36,480 --> 08:53:37,100
I didn't even notice!

10730
08:53:37,680 --> 08:53:38,940
That's how mushy it is.

10731
08:53:39,260 --> 08:53:41,340
It's like actual pasta right now.

10732
08:53:41,800 --> 08:53:43,780
Thank you for the 5 gifted subs!

10733
08:53:43,780 --> 08:53:44,680
Thank you, thank you.

10734
08:53:44,680 --> 08:53:46,980
Oh my god, we're at 2k subscribers now.

10735
08:53:47,060 --> 08:53:47,880
That's crazy.

10736
08:53:48,400 --> 08:53:49,900
As someone that doesn't stream on Twitch.

10737
08:53:50,100 --> 08:53:51,800
To be fair, I've been living on Twitch.

10738
08:53:52,280 --> 08:53:52,900
Because of this.

10739
08:53:56,120 --> 08:53:57,680
I need to get top 2!

10740
08:53:58,040 --> 08:54:00,040
Please, 150 points at least today.

10741
08:54:00,440 --> 08:54:02,640
Also, Camilla, thank you for the 5 gifted subs!

10742
08:54:02,720 --> 08:54:03,660
Thank you, thank you.

10743
08:54:03,700 --> 08:54:05,340
It's like overcooked pasta.

10744
08:54:07,320 --> 08:54:08,660
Everything will be fine.

10745
08:54:08,660 --> 08:54:12,280
Don't forget, securing the mission area is your top priority.

10746
08:54:12,440 --> 08:54:13,920
I've been here for a fucking week.

10747
08:54:14,080 --> 08:54:16,080
I'm sorry, I'm like...

10748
08:54:16,080 --> 08:54:16,340
What?

10749
08:54:16,880 --> 08:54:17,340
No!

10750
08:54:22,580 --> 08:54:23,840
You got cooked, bro.

10751
08:54:24,220 --> 08:54:25,840
Bro, you just did this.

10752
08:54:27,080 --> 08:54:28,340
Oh, he got eeved.

10753
08:54:28,480 --> 08:54:30,100
Good doggy.

10754
08:54:32,500 --> 08:54:34,200
Keep talking to me guys, I'm fighting here.

10755
08:54:34,780 --> 08:54:35,680
Are you winning?

10756
08:54:37,900 --> 08:54:39,160
It's not about winning or losing.

10757
08:54:39,440 --> 08:54:40,240
It's about fighting.

10758
08:54:40,620 --> 08:54:42,740
Yes, it is about winning or losing.

10759
08:54:42,880 --> 08:54:43,620
What do you mean?

10760
08:54:44,460 --> 08:54:45,820
It's about winning, not losing.

10761
08:54:46,120 --> 08:54:47,780
It's about giving it your best.

10762
08:54:48,120 --> 08:54:49,120
No, listen, I'm fighting here.

10763
08:54:51,560 --> 08:54:53,760
Oh, I'm getting shot at by Strange.

10764
08:54:53,840 --> 08:54:54,520
Where's my Strange?

10765
08:54:54,540 --> 08:54:55,920
I'm right there, I'm right there.

10766
08:54:57,080 --> 08:54:58,460
Doggy, we have Doggy.

10767
08:54:59,340 --> 08:55:00,980
Let's get him, let's get him, let's get him.

10768
08:55:03,580 --> 08:55:05,540
I'm using it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

10769
08:55:06,120 --> 08:55:06,980
Yeah, baby.

10770
08:55:07,400 --> 08:55:09,220
Keep brawling if you need to.

10771
08:55:10,520 --> 08:55:11,680
I'm on point.

10772
08:55:15,800 --> 08:55:17,680
Oh my gosh.

10773
08:55:19,700 --> 08:55:22,580
Oh my god, our first Hulk Iron Man win.

10774
08:55:24,440 --> 08:55:25,980
It's the first of many.

10775
08:55:26,480 --> 08:55:28,020
The first of many.

10776
08:55:28,020 --> 08:55:28,180
Baby.

10777
08:55:33,340 --> 08:55:35,380
Three supports in the team.

10778
08:55:35,660 --> 08:55:37,660
There's probably triple support, what's wrong with that?

10779
08:55:38,000 --> 08:55:39,160
We did it.

10780
08:55:39,480 --> 08:55:41,660
We fucking did it, guys.

10781
08:55:45,800 --> 08:55:46,920
Oh my god.

10782
08:55:47,140 --> 08:55:49,060
I don't even get to be a hundred, that's...

10783
08:55:49,060 --> 08:55:51,640
Oh my god, that's... makes me sad.

10784
08:55:52,100 --> 08:55:55,060
I don't even get to break three digits.

10785
08:55:56,340 --> 08:55:58,660
You're right, this is where the win streak starts, guys.

10786
08:55:58,660 --> 08:55:59,980
This is...

10787
08:55:59,980 --> 08:56:01,640
I streamed for so long.

10788
08:56:01,800 --> 08:56:04,140
I'm literally at decent hours now.

10789
08:56:04,340 --> 08:56:06,120
I'm at decent streaming hours.

10790
08:56:06,240 --> 08:56:07,980
That's how long I haven't streamed.

10791
08:56:11,160 --> 08:56:13,620
Thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

10792
08:56:13,720 --> 08:56:14,920
Thank you, thank you.

10793
08:56:15,400 --> 08:56:17,320
Guys, you wanted decent hours.

10794
08:56:17,560 --> 08:56:18,340
Here we go.

10795
08:56:18,760 --> 08:56:21,260
I'm technically on a decent schedule now.

10796
08:56:22,060 --> 08:56:23,120
We're so back.

10797
08:56:23,280 --> 08:56:26,680
Guys, we need like...

10798
08:56:26,680 --> 08:56:28,840
You're right, the winds don't kick in until...

10799
08:56:28,840 --> 08:56:30,000
9 hours deep.

10800
08:56:30,780 --> 08:56:31,660
You're so right.

10801
08:56:32,920 --> 08:56:33,680
That's...

10802
08:56:33,680 --> 08:56:35,020
That's where...

10803
08:56:35,020 --> 08:56:37,140
You're so fucking right.

10804
08:56:43,720 --> 08:56:47,000
Technically, in East Coast, it's 9 AM.

10805
08:56:47,340 --> 08:56:48,620
So it's decent hours.

10806
08:56:50,580 --> 08:56:51,340
Technically.

10807
08:56:52,700 --> 08:56:54,420
I believe in us.

10808
08:56:55,120 --> 08:56:58,680
This is where the win streak kicks in.

10809
08:57:00,620 --> 08:57:03,020
This is where the win streak kicks in.

10810
08:57:04,600 --> 08:57:06,080
Oh shit, it's...

10811
08:57:06,740 --> 08:57:07,900
Oh no, that's central.

10812
08:57:08,860 --> 08:57:10,340
I'm thinking about central.

10813
08:57:10,600 --> 08:57:10,840
Sorry.

10814
08:57:11,440 --> 08:57:14,480
You guys haven't existed for me for so long.

10815
08:57:14,580 --> 08:57:16,100
I already forgot the time zones.

10816
08:57:16,640 --> 08:57:18,900
No, I am locked in.

10817
08:57:19,300 --> 08:57:21,540
I am so locked in right now.

10818
08:57:23,540 --> 08:57:25,180
I messed up.

10819
08:57:28,840 --> 08:57:29,840
What is this?

10820
08:57:30,860 --> 08:57:32,040
Who the fuck are this?

10821
08:57:32,220 --> 08:57:33,260
Is this also EU?

10822
08:57:33,400 --> 08:57:34,100
My two ping?

10823
08:57:36,140 --> 08:57:37,540
Is this also EU?

10824
08:57:41,300 --> 08:57:41,520
Yeah.

10825
08:57:41,520 --> 08:57:42,780
Okay, hear me out, hear me out.

10826
08:57:43,140 --> 08:57:44,080
5 on 5, okay?

10827
08:57:45,540 --> 08:57:46,780
We have an Itzkan player.

10828
08:57:46,940 --> 08:57:49,480
And they have a Groot OTP.

10829
08:57:49,640 --> 08:57:51,540
He's good on the other character, but we should probably ban him.

10830
08:57:52,360 --> 08:57:53,820
Okay, what if we ban Groot?

10831
08:57:54,020 --> 08:57:55,180
Then they ban Strange.

10832
08:57:55,360 --> 08:57:56,120
Then they ban Hulk.

10833
08:57:56,120 --> 08:57:57,020
And we ban Magneto.

10834
08:57:57,180 --> 08:57:57,940
And then we replace Sain.

10835
08:58:00,840 --> 08:58:01,200
Bogrenation.

10836
08:58:02,160 --> 08:58:02,880
Let's go.

10837
08:58:03,300 --> 08:58:04,360
I'm locked in.

10838
08:58:05,520 --> 08:58:06,520
I'm so ready.

10839
08:58:07,740 --> 08:58:08,980
And if I'm not...

10840
08:58:08,980 --> 08:58:09,500
I should know.

10841
08:58:11,040 --> 08:58:12,980
My EU translation...

10842
08:58:14,060 --> 08:58:15,540
isn't working right now.

10843
08:58:15,640 --> 08:58:18,220
I literally had no idea what he just said.

10844
08:58:18,840 --> 08:58:20,360
I'm so sorry.

10845
08:58:21,220 --> 08:58:24,120
My brain cannot translate anymore.

10846
08:58:29,240 --> 08:58:31,380
What did he say?

10847
08:58:32,200 --> 08:58:34,500
All I heard was Itzkan.

10848
08:58:35,140 --> 08:58:36,820
You will go support, buddy.

10849
08:58:36,820 --> 08:58:38,020
Yeah, okay.

10850
08:58:38,440 --> 08:58:39,880
Because they are about to ban Hulk.

10851
08:58:40,620 --> 08:58:42,160
It's Hulk Nation time.

10852
08:58:45,200 --> 08:58:45,860
Oh, again, Niki.

10853
08:58:46,280 --> 08:58:47,360
There's one character.

10854
08:58:47,580 --> 08:58:49,400
Here you go, girl.

10855
08:58:51,400 --> 08:58:52,840
This is the second win.

10856
08:58:53,180 --> 08:58:56,700
This is the second Hulk Ironman win.

10857
08:58:56,780 --> 08:58:57,980
Hulk Nation in shambles.

10858
08:59:00,680 --> 08:59:02,940
We're all on the same team!

10859
08:59:03,220 --> 08:59:03,580
What team?

10860
08:59:03,580 --> 08:59:06,380
Listen, I clicked on your chat and people are telling you to go to sleep.

10861
08:59:06,980 --> 08:59:08,540
Yeah, exactly.

10862
08:59:09,260 --> 08:59:11,120
Never go to sleep, loser.

10863
08:59:11,520 --> 08:59:13,340
We get 200 points today.

10864
08:59:15,240 --> 08:59:17,640
We built true strength.

10865
08:59:18,040 --> 08:59:20,340
I'm so locked in.

10866
08:59:21,700 --> 08:59:23,200
I'm so locked in.

10867
08:59:23,540 --> 08:59:25,080
I'm so locked in.

10868
08:59:26,060 --> 08:59:28,020
I'm fucking locked in, bro.

10869
08:59:29,300 --> 08:59:30,280
I'm so locked in.

10870
08:59:30,820 --> 08:59:35,760
Also, a lot of people keep asking me if I'm playing with Valeria, the voice actor of Venture.

10871
08:59:35,780 --> 08:59:36,940
Because you have very similar voices.

10872
08:59:39,640 --> 08:59:40,600
Venture from Overwatch?

10873
08:59:42,620 --> 08:59:43,500
Valeria Rodriguez.

10874
08:59:44,420 --> 08:59:45,540
My ghost, personal ghost.

10875
08:59:46,360 --> 08:59:48,740
Do I sound like her?

10876
08:59:49,380 --> 08:59:50,600
That's the first time I heard that.

10877
08:59:50,960 --> 08:59:52,820
I hear so many other comparisons.

10878
08:59:56,120 --> 08:59:57,240
Anyways, guys, lock in.

10879
08:59:58,860 --> 08:59:59,740
She does?

10880
08:59:59,940 --> 09:00:00,520
Yeah, right?

10881
09:00:00,700 --> 09:00:01,820
I'm just like, what?

10882
09:00:04,120 --> 09:00:05,960
I do not think I sound good.

10883
09:00:10,480 --> 09:00:11,960
Oh my god, we did it.

10884
09:00:11,960 --> 09:00:12,580
Bad Hella.

10885
09:00:18,220 --> 09:00:20,160
There's an Ironman above us.

10886
09:00:24,900 --> 09:00:25,780
We're up one.

10887
09:00:28,640 --> 09:00:30,260
I can't see you, I can't heal you.

10888
09:00:30,440 --> 09:00:31,760
Ironman one, Ironman one, I got Ironman.

10889
09:00:31,760 --> 09:00:32,640
It's mine, it's mine.

10890
09:00:35,820 --> 09:00:40,520
I'm locked in, guys.

10891
09:00:45,160 --> 09:00:46,180
Magnus one too.

10892
09:00:49,360 --> 09:00:50,620
Hella to right, Hella to right.

10893
09:00:51,360 --> 09:00:53,000
Oh, Ironman too.

10894
09:00:54,300 --> 09:00:54,920
We win this, bro.

10895
09:00:55,080 --> 09:00:55,660
They can't touch.

10896
09:00:56,680 --> 09:00:57,540
Oh, you're nice.

10897
09:01:01,760 --> 09:01:03,120
Guys, I blame my two ping.

10898
09:01:09,820 --> 09:01:10,260
Okay,

10899
09:01:14,940 --> 09:01:15,200
don't worry.

10900
09:01:16,680 --> 09:01:20,020
Things are blurring together, but don't worry, I'm so locked in.

10901
09:01:21,280 --> 09:01:22,760
I'm pushing cart so you don't have heals.

10902
09:01:23,260 --> 09:01:23,940
You have Mantis heals.

10903
09:01:33,960 --> 09:01:35,820
Oh, we can Mantis ult first.

10904
09:01:38,180 --> 09:01:41,300
Literally, I know right, two ping, literally unplayable.

10905
09:01:42,940 --> 09:01:44,440
I can't believe it.

10906
09:01:44,920 --> 09:01:47,980
What's the point of living next to the servers if I get two ping?

10907
09:01:52,700 --> 09:02:00,760
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

10908
09:02:04,160 --> 09:02:05,260
Oh, he's baby.

10909
09:02:05,880 --> 09:02:07,000
He's baby now.

10910
09:02:08,620 --> 09:02:11,360
I have to reload, I have to reload.

10911
09:02:15,980 --> 09:02:17,360
Oh, it's Hella, Hella.

10912
09:02:22,800 --> 09:02:24,000
I'm on Hella, you know.

10913
09:02:24,560 --> 09:02:26,440
There's a, Ironman to right, Ironman half.

10914
09:02:28,020 --> 09:02:29,560
He's solo, he's one, he's one, he's one.

10915
09:02:30,680 --> 09:02:31,820
I froze all, fuck one.

10916
09:02:35,240 --> 09:02:37,720
Hulk low, Hulk low, Hulk low, Hulk low.

10917
09:02:38,260 --> 09:02:38,700
I'm fighting.

10918
09:02:43,780 --> 09:02:45,660
I'm on Mantis, oh wait, they support us.

10919
09:02:50,660 --> 09:02:52,340
We're okay, oh we are not okay.

10920
09:02:59,500 --> 09:03:00,380
I reload.

10921
09:03:01,080 --> 09:03:02,700
Magnio, Magnio Magnio on point, Magnio on point.

10922
09:03:05,440 --> 09:03:07,000
That's fine, that's fine, we win this point.

10923
09:03:07,360 --> 09:03:08,360
I still have my lune all up.

10924
09:03:13,160 --> 09:03:13,940
Don't worry.

10925
09:03:17,000 --> 09:03:20,040
Oh my god, you're so healthy!

10926
09:03:23,300 --> 09:03:24,520
You think they know you're up there?

10927
09:03:30,760 --> 09:03:32,620
Oh my god, what's going on?

10928
09:03:32,620 --> 09:03:34,700
What's going on?

10929
09:03:36,040 --> 09:03:38,000
What's going on?

10930
09:03:39,460 --> 09:03:42,060
I'm just shooting bodies!

10931
09:03:42,800 --> 09:03:44,480
Get healed, get healed, get healed.

10932
09:03:52,560 --> 09:03:55,160
I haven't stopped healing!

10933
09:03:57,740 --> 09:03:59,760
Magnio to the right, Magnio to the right.

10934
09:03:59,760 --> 09:04:01,240
Magnio solo to the right.

10935
09:04:01,500 --> 09:04:02,360
He's over there.

10936
09:04:02,720 --> 09:04:05,380
Bye bye.

10937
09:04:09,340 --> 09:04:10,900
What's going on?

10938
09:04:10,900 --> 09:04:12,180
He's out, he's out.

10939
09:04:12,360 --> 09:04:13,480
Okay, we need to get this face.

10940
09:04:15,120 --> 09:04:16,760
Ironman, Ironman, Ironman, watch out, watch out.

10941
09:04:16,840 --> 09:04:17,360
Nice pick, nice pick.

10942
09:04:18,080 --> 09:04:18,480
Nice.

10943
09:04:22,960 --> 09:04:24,060
I woke you up.

10944
09:04:26,240 --> 09:04:27,600
Oh, I got you!

10945
09:04:28,240 --> 09:04:29,500
I got you!

10946
09:04:30,120 --> 09:04:31,200
You're so healthy!

10947
09:04:31,700 --> 09:04:32,780
I can't hold after this.

10948
09:04:35,920 --> 09:04:37,980
I'm ulting, I'm ulting on the cart.

10949
09:04:41,260 --> 09:04:42,900
Ironman, Ironman, Ironman.

10950
09:04:43,200 --> 09:04:45,040
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear!

10951
09:04:45,120 --> 09:04:45,340
No!

10952
09:04:50,660 --> 09:04:52,120
Oh my god.

10953
09:04:53,140 --> 09:04:56,480
No, I feared, I feared.

10954
09:04:59,100 --> 09:05:00,920
He told you.

10955
09:05:01,280 --> 09:05:02,780
He warned you.

10956
09:05:02,780 --> 09:05:03,640
Oh my god.

10957
09:05:04,080 --> 09:05:06,480
He warned you, Toki.

10958
09:05:11,060 --> 09:05:11,540
Nice.

10959
09:05:13,780 --> 09:05:14,260
Maximum!

10960
09:05:14,540 --> 09:05:15,420
Oh, that's behind us!

10961
09:05:21,080 --> 09:05:22,040
That's fine.

10962
09:05:24,480 --> 09:05:26,040
He warned you, Toki.

10963
09:05:26,140 --> 09:05:27,180
How did you not know?

10964
09:05:28,040 --> 09:05:30,520
Oh my god, my thing is not...

10965
09:05:30,520 --> 09:05:32,320
I can't get to you.

10966
09:05:38,420 --> 09:05:39,080
Oh my god.

10967
09:05:39,080 --> 09:05:40,060
Oh, I need heals, I need heals if you can.

10968
09:05:40,320 --> 09:05:40,660
Matis.

10969
09:05:48,220 --> 09:05:49,840
Oh, I can't see you, Booger.

10970
09:05:52,900 --> 09:05:53,820
Ironman, Ironman, Ironman.

10971
09:05:54,060 --> 09:05:55,520
Oh my god.

10972
09:05:55,720 --> 09:05:57,160
You were not chilling.

10973
09:05:57,160 --> 09:05:58,740
I need five, five, five.

10974
09:05:58,900 --> 09:06:00,840
I have all in 20.

10975
09:06:04,540 --> 09:06:06,000
I froze somebody.

10976
09:06:08,700 --> 09:06:11,320
Our Matis has two people, two tanks on her.

10977
09:06:21,800 --> 09:06:23,300
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

10978
09:06:23,720 --> 09:06:24,740
I'm damage boosting.

10979
09:06:27,160 --> 09:06:27,340
Oh!

10980
09:06:30,060 --> 09:06:31,100
He's smashing!

10981
09:06:33,580 --> 09:06:35,540
Two, one, I'm backing out.

10982
09:06:36,420 --> 09:06:37,420
I froze Hulk.

10983
09:06:42,180 --> 09:06:43,800
Ela's looking at me, I can't heal.

10984
09:06:45,700 --> 09:06:47,220
Oh, I can't heal, I can't heal.

10985
09:06:50,700 --> 09:06:51,900
It's just you, Booger.

10986
09:06:51,900 --> 09:06:52,440
Okay, that's fine.

10987
09:06:56,940 --> 09:06:58,360
Oh, I might be dead.

10988
09:06:58,720 --> 09:07:00,520
Oh, you're dead.

10989
09:07:00,820 --> 09:07:02,600
I'm so dead.

10990
09:07:08,700 --> 09:07:10,420
We have Hela going in.

10991
09:07:10,780 --> 09:07:13,020
And maybe we can get Matis up.

10992
09:07:15,180 --> 09:07:19,640
Guys, you gotta watch out for the Jarvis clip that guy.

10993
09:07:20,140 --> 09:07:21,720
Yeah, he has Ironman ult.

10994
09:07:25,550 --> 09:07:26,950
I'm kind of stuck here.

10995
09:07:26,950 --> 09:07:27,530
I'm fine, I'm fine.

10996
09:07:27,610 --> 09:07:28,630
Please go, please go, please go.

10997
09:07:30,610 --> 09:07:31,470
Ironman ult!

10998
09:07:33,750 --> 09:07:35,090
We lost two.

10999
09:07:35,250 --> 09:07:36,110
We should back up.

11000
09:07:45,450 --> 09:07:52,470
I'm healing our tanks.

11001
09:07:53,210 --> 09:07:55,070
I'm on our tanks, I don't see Hela.

11002
09:07:59,990 --> 09:08:00,930
Oh my god.

11003
09:08:03,630 --> 09:08:04,430
Nice, nice.

11004
09:08:05,930 --> 09:08:07,310
Matis two left, Matis.

11005
09:08:07,890 --> 09:08:08,830
We got this, we got this, we got this.

11006
09:08:09,710 --> 09:08:10,730
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

11007
09:08:11,830 --> 09:08:12,350
Hulk half.

11008
09:08:13,290 --> 09:08:15,090
Heal him, heal him, heal him.

11009
09:08:17,530 --> 09:08:19,470
Back up, back up, back up.

11010
09:08:22,090 --> 09:08:23,590
Oh my god.

11011
09:08:24,870 --> 09:08:26,290
That was crazy.

11012
09:08:26,290 --> 09:08:29,850
What a fucking- That was a crazy push.

11013
09:08:32,610 --> 09:08:34,290
Oh my god.

11014
09:08:39,470 --> 09:08:41,130
Could this be it?

11015
09:08:41,170 --> 09:08:44,170
Our second Ironman Hulk win?

11016
09:08:44,810 --> 09:08:46,370
After nine hours?

11017
09:08:49,350 --> 09:08:53,090
How many fingers am I holding up?

11018
09:08:59,050 --> 09:08:59,610
Oh my god.

11019
09:09:00,070 --> 09:09:02,230
Oh my god, this could be it.

11020
09:09:02,550 --> 09:09:04,410
We just gotta believe.

11021
09:09:07,410 --> 09:09:09,170
We just gotta believe.

11022
09:09:11,270 --> 09:09:16,210
Guys, but like, if I can hit 200 points today, we're so close to finishing this off.

11023
09:09:16,350 --> 09:09:17,270
We're so close.

11024
09:09:18,690 --> 09:09:20,850
I legit think I need 250 for the cut.

11025
09:09:20,930 --> 09:09:21,610
Oh my god.

11026
09:09:21,730 --> 09:09:24,010
I need 250 for the fucking cut.

11027
09:09:24,010 --> 09:09:27,730
I just gotta- Stop climbing!

11028
09:09:29,770 --> 09:09:30,490
Stop climbing!

11029
09:09:31,790 --> 09:09:33,130
Why don't you come here right now?

11030
09:09:33,510 --> 09:09:35,170
Don't be a pussy, don't be a pussy, don't be a pussy.

11031
09:09:35,450 --> 09:09:35,950
Come here, come here.

11032
09:09:36,410 --> 09:09:37,950
Jarvis, Jarvis, Jarvis.

11033
09:09:38,430 --> 09:09:39,090
Jarvis, come here.

11034
09:09:39,550 --> 09:09:41,870
I'll bubble you, I'll bubble you.

11035
09:09:42,050 --> 09:09:42,490
I'll bubble you.

11036
09:09:42,590 --> 09:09:44,230
I need people to stop climbing.

11037
09:09:45,290 --> 09:09:47,410
So I can just leave it at 200.

11038
09:09:47,410 --> 09:09:48,730
2, 1.

11039
09:09:50,310 --> 09:09:52,490
You have to stop them from securing the missionary.

11040
09:09:54,290 --> 09:09:55,650
Jarvis, Jarvis, Jarvis.

11041
09:09:55,870 --> 09:09:57,650
2%, 2%.

11042
09:09:58,330 --> 09:09:59,730
2%, I have 4%.

11043
09:09:59,730 --> 09:10:00,850
This is about min-maxing, really.

11044
09:10:08,550 --> 09:10:11,330
What if I jump into them and die?

11045
09:10:12,050 --> 09:10:12,690
No, no, no.

11046
09:10:12,890 --> 09:10:14,030
Do it, it'll be so funny.

11047
09:10:14,230 --> 09:10:14,650
Please?

11048
09:10:15,150 --> 09:10:15,590
Do it.

11049
09:10:15,590 --> 09:10:16,830
It'll be so funny.

11050
09:10:27,670 --> 09:10:29,970
Hulk up top, Hulk up top.

11051
09:10:35,790 --> 09:10:37,310
Hulk left half, Hulk half.

11052
09:10:39,310 --> 09:10:40,470
I'm beaming them, beaming them.

11053
09:10:41,850 --> 09:10:43,230
I'm punching them, by the way, I'm punching them.

11054
09:10:43,230 --> 09:10:44,050
I'm punching them.

11055
09:10:48,890 --> 09:10:49,890
Oh, Hela, no!

11056
09:10:51,010 --> 09:10:52,010
Hela, I got you, I got you.

11057
09:10:53,750 --> 09:10:55,230
The Hulk here, we're having a 1v1.

11058
09:10:57,530 --> 09:10:58,410
Yeah, I'm chasing.

11059
09:11:00,650 --> 09:11:01,230
Where is he right now?

11060
09:11:01,830 --> 09:11:02,410
I have no idea.

11061
09:11:02,770 --> 09:11:03,410
Oh, he's here, he's here.

11062
09:11:03,530 --> 09:11:03,710
Watch out.

11063
09:11:04,330 --> 09:11:04,810
I'm gonna look at him.

11064
09:11:09,150 --> 09:11:09,710
I'm trying.

11065
09:11:13,790 --> 09:11:15,890
Did he just clip this?

11066
09:11:16,570 --> 09:11:17,330
Hulk half, Hulk half.

11067
09:11:18,130 --> 09:11:19,330
Hulk is low.

11068
09:11:21,610 --> 09:11:23,010
He's not low, I lied.

11069
09:11:23,190 --> 09:11:25,190
I just thought they would look at him.

11070
09:11:25,890 --> 09:11:27,070
Travis clipped that.

11071
09:11:29,930 --> 09:11:32,070
Look at the one guy that's not streaming.

11072
09:11:32,270 --> 09:11:33,630
He's like, Travis clipped that.

11073
09:11:38,980 --> 09:11:41,480
Don't worry, you're so healthy, little guy.

11074
09:11:43,020 --> 09:11:44,480
You're so healthy.

11075
09:11:44,780 --> 09:11:45,380
Watch this.

11076
09:11:49,860 --> 09:11:51,480
Where's my nice freeze, chat?

11077
09:11:53,680 --> 09:11:55,380
Where's my nice freeze?

11078
09:11:57,060 --> 09:11:57,360
Here.

11079
09:12:03,940 --> 09:12:05,540
Oh my god.

11080
09:12:10,160 --> 09:12:11,140
Oh man.

11081
09:12:11,680 --> 09:12:13,500
Hulk is definitely mad now.

11082
09:12:13,780 --> 09:12:15,160
Oh, I'm gonna ult here.

11083
09:12:15,500 --> 09:12:15,980
I'm ulting.

11084
09:12:20,820 --> 09:12:22,260
I'm okay, I'm okay.

11085
09:12:23,600 --> 09:12:25,000
You're so healthy.

11086
09:12:28,520 --> 09:12:30,820
I'm in such a zen state now.

11087
09:12:31,800 --> 09:12:33,600
Bro, every time I hear

11088
09:12:39,400 --> 09:12:40,040
fear...

11089
09:12:40,040 --> 09:12:44,200
Fear and pulse charge, I fear.

11090
09:12:45,180 --> 09:12:46,480
I literally wake up.

11091
09:12:48,460 --> 09:12:49,760
I fear.

11092
09:12:50,900 --> 09:12:52,280
I actually fear.

11093
09:12:58,720 --> 09:13:00,040
There's a Thor.

11094
09:13:05,620 --> 09:13:07,720
Thor is frozen, Thor is frozen.

11095
09:13:10,040 --> 09:13:11,260
I fear myself.

11096
09:13:14,440 --> 09:13:16,280
Look at Hella, look at Hella.

11097
09:13:17,020 --> 09:13:18,060
I'm going first.

11098
09:13:19,360 --> 09:13:20,500
Drop down.

11099
09:13:21,520 --> 09:13:22,400
I couldn't, sorry.

11100
09:13:22,920 --> 09:13:26,160
I have two people on me and I'm scared.

11101
09:13:27,420 --> 09:13:28,180
Starlord is one.

11102
09:13:34,220 --> 09:13:35,580
She's Hella dead, yeah.

11103
09:13:35,580 --> 09:13:37,140
I'm ulting.

11104
09:13:37,300 --> 09:13:38,940
Oh, I saw that, Hella.

11105
09:13:41,560 --> 09:13:46,320
Is Mantis alive?

11106
09:13:51,480 --> 09:13:53,860
Why did it take so long?

11107
09:13:55,100 --> 09:13:58,640
Why did it take so long to kill Mantis?

11108
09:14:01,360 --> 09:14:02,420
Oh, fear.

11109
09:14:03,460 --> 09:14:03,960
Oh.

11110
09:14:06,800 --> 09:14:07,460
Magneel's half.

11111
09:14:12,900 --> 09:14:13,900
What happened?

11112
09:14:14,160 --> 09:14:15,260
What happened to him?

11113
09:14:15,600 --> 09:14:16,580
What's going on?

11114
09:14:18,220 --> 09:14:19,280
I need help, I need help.

11115
09:14:19,820 --> 09:14:20,960
I'm okay, I'm okay.

11116
09:14:21,220 --> 09:14:21,920
I leave you.

11117
09:14:22,100 --> 09:14:23,480
I'm sorry Mantis, you're gonna die.

11118
09:14:25,040 --> 09:14:25,920
Two out of two.

11119
09:14:26,360 --> 09:14:27,500
Two out of two.

11120
09:14:28,160 --> 09:14:29,960
Yeah, I get it.

11121
09:14:32,420 --> 09:14:34,360
I was like, I'm sorry Mantis.

11122
09:14:35,060 --> 09:14:41,560
It was worth it.

11123
09:14:42,380 --> 09:14:43,940
Oh my god.

11124
09:14:48,540 --> 09:14:49,740
You're safe.

11125
09:14:50,180 --> 09:14:50,820
Goodbye.

11126
09:14:52,420 --> 09:14:56,280
He did so much to save me and then I just left him to die.

11127
09:14:58,700 --> 09:15:01,320
I was like, I'm sorry buddy.

11128
09:15:01,900 --> 09:15:03,540
I'm fucking out.

11129
09:15:04,000 --> 09:15:05,220
I'm fucking out.

11130
09:15:07,640 --> 09:15:09,260
Two more for 150.

11131
09:15:10,000 --> 09:15:10,980
Two more.

11132
09:15:12,120 --> 09:15:13,840
10,000 damage?

11133
09:15:14,020 --> 09:15:14,300
Who?

11134
09:15:15,360 --> 09:15:16,420
Oh, our Starlord.

11135
09:15:17,140 --> 09:15:18,680
Oh my god, poor guy.

11136
09:15:19,300 --> 09:15:21,040
Fucking 19 deaths?

11137
09:15:21,080 --> 09:15:22,600
What the fuck was he doing?

11138
09:15:22,600 --> 09:15:28,240
What the fuck was he doing?

11139
09:15:28,260 --> 09:15:35,860
Look, I know I could have saved him because I literally had the best ult when it comes to like, you know, saving him.

11140
09:15:36,340 --> 09:15:39,000
But I don't know if Mac is doing okay.

11141
09:15:40,440 --> 09:15:41,480
He's climbing.

11142
09:15:47,120 --> 09:15:48,340
Why is Gamora?

11143
09:15:49,320 --> 09:15:51,260
No one asked how is Gamora.

11144
09:15:51,700 --> 09:15:53,080
How is Gamora?

11145
09:15:53,080 --> 09:15:54,260
Oh my god, my dream.

11146
09:15:54,380 --> 09:15:55,740
We have cross, cross, cross with us again.

11147
09:15:55,920 --> 09:15:56,840
Can't lose.

11148
09:15:57,080 --> 09:16:00,720
Can't lose, can't win.

11149
09:16:02,400 --> 09:16:03,480
Why is Gamora?

11150
09:16:03,860 --> 09:16:06,400
We don't ask how is Gamora.

11151
09:16:10,060 --> 09:16:11,440
When is Gamora?

11152
09:16:11,600 --> 09:16:12,520
Guys, can you do the bans?

11153
09:16:12,580 --> 09:16:13,220
I'm gonna go piss.

11154
09:16:14,340 --> 09:16:14,760
Good luck.

11155
09:16:16,600 --> 09:16:18,380
Is there a Black Panther play on the enemy team?

11156
09:16:18,560 --> 09:16:19,240
Okay, let me think.

11157
09:16:19,240 --> 09:16:20,480
Whom is Gamora?

11158
09:16:21,940 --> 09:16:24,880
You guys see that new James Gunn show?

11159
09:16:25,680 --> 09:16:27,460
The DC one?

11160
09:16:29,960 --> 09:16:31,600
And like...

11161
09:16:31,600 --> 09:16:32,500
I...

11162
09:16:33,420 --> 09:16:35,280
There's so much...

11163
09:16:36,380 --> 09:16:38,920
I tried to watch the new...

11164
09:16:38,920 --> 09:16:46,720
the new James Gunn animated show and I was not ready for all the fucking...

11165
09:16:48,100 --> 09:16:50,520
The Creature Commandos.

11166
09:16:51,000 --> 09:16:51,440
Yeah.

11167
09:16:51,880 --> 09:16:53,780
I was just like...

11168
09:16:53,780 --> 09:16:54,280
What the fuck?

11169
09:16:56,920 --> 09:16:59,220
They also like...

11170
09:16:59,220 --> 09:17:01,540
They added the newest...

11171
09:17:01,540 --> 09:17:13,900
I haven't watched the full show but I've seen like clips of it on... I saw clips of it on Twitter and then he introduced... Did you guys know there's a superhero Hooters bar in the DC universe?

11172
09:17:13,900 --> 09:17:15,800
I didn't know that.

11173
09:17:15,920 --> 09:17:19,900
I didn't realize in the DC universe they have...

11174
09:17:21,180 --> 09:17:22,700
They have superhero Hooters.

11175
09:17:22,940 --> 09:17:23,300
Yeah!

11176
09:17:24,280 --> 09:17:30,400
Where like instead of like they wear like the Hooters thing, they wear like superhero costumes.

11177
09:17:32,540 --> 09:17:33,990
And then they had...

11178
09:17:35,800 --> 09:17:36,280
Nope.

11179
09:17:36,900 --> 09:17:39,220
We had a 100% win rate.

11180
09:17:43,900 --> 09:17:45,200
It's all about the...

11181
09:17:45,200 --> 09:17:47,500
It's all about the multiverse.

11182
09:17:48,700 --> 09:17:51,080
Shut the fuck up.

11183
09:17:57,620 --> 09:17:59,180
I'm mad.

11184
09:18:05,140 --> 09:18:06,180
Alright.

11185
09:18:07,420 --> 09:18:08,220
Hell yeah.

11186
09:18:10,240 --> 09:18:11,140
I'm so cooked.

11187
09:18:11,580 --> 09:18:12,120
I am.

11188
09:18:12,120 --> 09:18:13,620
Okay, we don't.

11189
09:18:13,940 --> 09:18:14,540
Okay, we don't.

11190
09:18:14,820 --> 09:18:15,380
Yeah.

11191
09:18:21,580 --> 09:18:22,220
Okay.

11192
09:18:30,160 --> 09:18:31,920
There's a magic to the left.

11193
09:18:36,580 --> 09:18:38,080
Magic, magic, magic.

11194
09:18:38,520 --> 09:18:39,340
Oh my god.

11195
09:18:39,340 --> 09:18:40,420
Oh my god.

11196
09:18:41,300 --> 09:18:42,720
There's a Captain America, right?

11197
09:18:44,260 --> 09:18:45,100
Magic on us?

11198
09:18:48,460 --> 09:18:49,480
Oh my god, please.

11199
09:18:50,760 --> 09:18:53,300
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

11200
09:18:53,960 --> 09:18:54,460
I bow in.

11201
09:18:55,700 --> 09:18:57,060
Magic, magic.

11202
09:18:57,600 --> 09:19:00,320
Oh my god, please let there be no...

11203
09:19:01,220 --> 09:19:02,460
There's a magic on us?

11204
09:19:02,860 --> 09:19:03,400
Magic, magic, magic.

11205
09:19:04,820 --> 09:19:05,840
Magic one, magic one.

11206
09:19:05,840 --> 09:19:07,660
Cap, cap, cap, cap.

11207
09:19:07,780 --> 09:19:09,260
Please, please.

11208
09:19:11,660 --> 09:19:13,040
Oh my god.

11209
09:19:17,240 --> 09:19:18,840
I have to reload.

11210
09:19:21,900 --> 09:19:23,900
I have all here too.

11211
09:19:24,500 --> 09:19:24,980
Nice, nice, nice.

11212
09:19:25,940 --> 09:19:29,040
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

11213
09:19:29,100 --> 09:19:29,320
I see.

11214
09:19:31,220 --> 09:19:32,060
Magic half.

11215
09:19:35,840 --> 09:19:36,980
I have no mag, by the way.

11216
09:19:37,980 --> 09:19:39,000
Oh, that's awkward.

11217
09:19:41,800 --> 09:19:42,880
I see him, I see him, I see him.

11218
09:19:43,100 --> 09:19:43,940
I have to reload.

11219
09:19:44,140 --> 09:19:45,880
Magic one.

11220
09:19:49,560 --> 09:19:50,400
Cap again.

11221
09:19:54,200 --> 09:19:55,040
Jesus Christ.

11222
09:19:57,540 --> 09:19:58,420
I have to ult this.

11223
09:19:58,840 --> 09:19:59,900
We're all too low.

11224
09:19:59,900 --> 09:20:02,280
Go, go, go, go, go.

11225
09:20:02,280 --> 09:20:03,100
I'm going backline.

11226
09:20:03,660 --> 09:20:04,500
Oh my god.

11227
09:20:05,360 --> 09:20:07,040
Mantis one, mantis one, mantis one.

11228
09:20:07,220 --> 09:20:11,360
Okay, four, three, two, one.

11229
09:20:18,020 --> 09:20:20,860
I have magic on me.

11230
09:20:23,820 --> 09:20:25,620
Our mantis is gonna die here.

11231
09:20:30,580 --> 09:20:31,820
Oh my god.

11232
09:20:32,060 --> 09:20:33,040
No supports, no supports.

11233
09:20:33,920 --> 09:20:35,160
Stay inside, stay inside, stay inside.

11234
09:20:35,540 --> 09:20:35,940
I'm coming.

11235
09:20:36,720 --> 09:20:38,200
Yeah, we're coming back now.

11236
09:20:39,820 --> 09:20:40,540
Mantis one, dead.

11237
09:20:41,080 --> 09:20:42,020
Look at the side, side, side, side.

11238
09:20:42,480 --> 09:20:44,420
If you can peek me, I can heal you.

11239
09:20:44,540 --> 09:20:45,380
I got you, I got you, I got you.

11240
09:20:48,240 --> 09:20:49,600
Just touch point, touch point again.

11241
09:20:52,200 --> 09:20:53,220
I'm king number two.

11242
09:20:54,500 --> 09:20:55,160
I'm fine, I'm fine.

11243
09:20:55,160 --> 09:20:56,780
Luna half.

11244
09:20:58,100 --> 09:20:59,420
Captain America half.

11245
09:21:02,860 --> 09:21:04,320
Come back, come back, come back.

11246
09:21:06,200 --> 09:21:08,480
Did they captain America ult yet?

11247
09:21:11,160 --> 09:21:11,840
Magic.

11248
09:21:14,920 --> 09:21:16,900
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.

11249
09:21:17,160 --> 09:21:18,200
Got the reload.

11250
09:21:20,680 --> 09:21:21,960
I stunned him.

11251
09:21:23,020 --> 09:21:24,680
Three, two, one.

11252
09:21:27,560 --> 09:21:28,700
Nice, nice, nice.

11253
09:21:29,020 --> 09:21:30,700
Mantis, mantis, mantis.

11254
09:21:30,820 --> 09:21:32,060
I have captain America on me.

11255
09:21:35,100 --> 09:21:36,640
We can live for...

11256
09:21:36,640 --> 09:21:37,400
I have ult, I have ult.

11257
09:21:39,160 --> 09:21:40,300
I'm on it, I'm on it.

11258
09:21:46,120 --> 09:21:48,640
Four, three, two, one.

11259
09:21:48,700 --> 09:21:49,420
I'm backing out now.

11260
09:21:52,720 --> 09:21:54,300
I have to get on point, I have to get on point.

11261
09:22:01,620 --> 09:22:02,800
Do we have TP?

11262
09:22:04,360 --> 09:22:05,100
We have TP.

11263
09:22:06,640 --> 09:22:07,020
No!

11264
09:22:14,560 --> 09:22:15,680
I fucked up there.

11265
09:22:18,760 --> 09:22:20,700
You only have mantis heals, you only have mantis heals.

11266
09:22:22,480 --> 09:22:24,140
Oh, I fucked up there.

11267
09:22:26,080 --> 09:22:26,900
Oh, I fucked up there.

11268
09:22:26,900 --> 09:22:28,660
I got shot at.

11269
09:22:30,880 --> 09:22:31,940
I don't know how we are losing this.

11270
09:22:33,400 --> 09:22:34,500
Another map, another map.

11271
09:22:35,580 --> 09:22:37,100
Helios, is that you?

11272
09:22:37,440 --> 09:22:38,640
Oh my god.

11273
09:22:40,100 --> 09:22:40,860
I fucked up there.

11274
09:22:40,880 --> 09:22:43,660
I didn't want to jump in because I knew I was going to get exploded.

11275
09:22:45,380 --> 09:22:49,080
I would have fucking exploded there if I jumped in.

11276
09:22:54,590 --> 09:22:58,010
So if I checked stream right now.

11277
09:22:58,190 --> 09:22:59,210
Whose stream?

11278
09:23:02,110 --> 09:23:04,090
Nadala, thank you for the five gifted subs.

11279
09:23:04,190 --> 09:23:05,010
Thank you.

11280
09:23:05,390 --> 09:23:07,370
We can't lose a game on Hulk.

11281
09:23:12,210 --> 09:23:13,250
Jesus Christ.

11282
09:23:13,310 --> 09:23:15,830
I feel like I healed so much during that too.

11283
09:23:15,990 --> 09:23:17,190
I never stopped healing.

11284
09:23:17,330 --> 09:23:19,270
I was just...

11285
09:23:26,010 --> 09:23:27,610
It's literally...

11286
09:23:36,210 --> 09:23:39,250
There's so many people that need heals.

11287
09:23:43,830 --> 09:23:45,030
I'm scared.

11288
09:23:45,810 --> 09:23:46,950
This Captain America is scary.

11289
09:23:47,650 --> 09:23:48,710
He's not doing much.

11290
09:23:48,830 --> 09:23:49,530
But he's just scary.

11291
09:23:52,850 --> 09:23:54,010
He's just there.

11292
09:23:55,110 --> 09:23:56,450
He's doing it for America.

11293
09:23:56,610 --> 09:23:57,170
And I'm scared.

11294
09:24:08,890 --> 09:24:12,670
I'm trying to help you, Mantis.

11295
09:24:12,670 --> 09:24:12,710
I'm trying to help you, Mantis.

11296
09:24:15,370 --> 09:24:17,950
We're getting pushed by this magic.

11297
09:24:21,630 --> 09:24:25,900
Bro, this fucking Mantis.

11298
09:24:28,060 --> 09:24:30,300
Like, what are we supposed to do?

11299
09:24:32,720 --> 09:24:36,500
This Luna actually saved their Mantis' life.

11300
09:24:37,620 --> 09:24:38,800
That was crazy.

11301
09:24:39,060 --> 09:24:42,320
That Luna babysat the fucking shit out of their Mantis.

11302
09:24:44,320 --> 09:24:45,120
I'm out.

11303
09:24:48,240 --> 09:24:50,300
There's a Magitier left.

11304
09:24:58,120 --> 09:25:00,380
There's a Psylocke behind me.

11305
09:25:00,440 --> 09:25:00,640
I need help.

11306
09:25:04,100 --> 09:25:05,420
That's a huge ult.

11307
09:25:06,160 --> 09:25:06,880
I'm ulting.

11308
09:25:14,320 --> 09:25:15,540
Nice, nice, nice.

11309
09:25:15,680 --> 09:25:22,900
We got Cap now.

11310
09:25:23,620 --> 09:25:24,500
I'm on Mantis.

11311
09:25:24,540 --> 09:25:24,980
Mantis one.

11312
09:25:26,200 --> 09:25:26,680
Give me life.

11313
09:25:28,300 --> 09:25:29,680
Oh my god.

11314
09:25:31,800 --> 09:25:33,240
I bubble.

11315
09:25:38,800 --> 09:25:40,240
I'm scared.

11316
09:25:41,240 --> 09:25:42,380
I'm so scared.

11317
09:25:46,810 --> 09:25:48,690
Oh, he's coming over.

11318
09:25:48,930 --> 09:25:50,690
He's coming over.

11319
09:25:51,310 --> 09:25:52,970
He's coming over.

11320
09:25:53,310 --> 09:25:53,710
Cap half.

11321
09:25:55,330 --> 09:25:56,270
Stay together.

11322
09:25:57,250 --> 09:25:59,510
Oh, we couldn't get to you.

11323
09:26:00,350 --> 09:26:01,390
Cap's still low.

11324
09:26:02,810 --> 09:26:03,910
Magic's behind you.

11325
09:26:06,870 --> 09:26:08,170
Mantis, I can't see you.

11326
09:26:11,650 --> 09:26:13,010
How about Captain America on me?

11327
09:26:14,330 --> 09:26:15,810
Oh no.

11328
09:26:16,870 --> 09:26:18,350
Oh no.

11329
09:26:18,350 --> 09:26:18,810
I know.

11330
09:26:19,430 --> 09:26:21,280
Our Mantis and I split up.

11331
09:26:22,830 --> 09:26:23,770
No.

11332
09:26:34,800 --> 09:26:36,620
Oh my god.

11333
09:26:36,660 --> 09:26:38,400
You fucking died so fast.

11334
09:26:39,540 --> 09:26:40,260
Yeah.

11335
09:26:48,060 --> 09:26:50,760
Sorry, I didn't see.

11336
09:26:51,800 --> 09:26:53,960
There's so many things going on.

11337
09:26:55,740 --> 09:26:57,180
There's so many.

11338
09:26:58,100 --> 09:27:00,140
I'm getting shot by like 10 angles.

11339
09:27:02,680 --> 09:27:03,280
Yeah.

11340
09:27:04,800 --> 09:27:07,080
I think they're on me.

11341
09:27:07,620 --> 09:27:08,460
I touched.

11342
09:27:09,100 --> 09:27:09,680
I'm dead though.

11343
09:27:11,240 --> 09:27:12,440
Oh my.

11344
09:27:12,980 --> 09:27:13,900
They're coming over.

11345
09:27:15,100 --> 09:27:16,540
No way, man.

11346
09:27:21,580 --> 09:27:23,440
There's too much pressure from every angle.

11347
09:27:25,200 --> 09:27:29,360
Yeah, yeah, it's the first one.

11348
09:27:30,140 --> 09:27:31,860
The first boss.

11349
09:27:33,300 --> 09:27:35,180
Don't die, Man Hulk.

11350
09:27:36,040 --> 09:27:38,400
It truly is the first one.

11351
09:27:42,800 --> 09:27:44,980
My god, we're so close.

11352
09:27:45,460 --> 09:27:48,180
We're so close to perf— We're so close.

11353
09:27:49,200 --> 09:27:51,040
Oh, I just need...

11354
09:27:51,040 --> 09:27:52,380
I just need 150.

11355
09:27:52,760 --> 09:27:54,840
Please get me out of here.

11356
09:27:55,240 --> 09:27:56,700
Get me out of here.

11357
09:27:58,200 --> 09:27:59,500
Toki, please.

11358
09:27:59,500 --> 09:28:00,800
We need this lead.

11359
09:28:03,340 --> 09:28:04,040
Weak!

11360
09:28:04,300 --> 09:28:05,640
You're all weak!

11361
09:28:08,260 --> 09:28:09,400
I've like...

11362
09:28:10,180 --> 09:28:12,280
Honestly, I've just accepted.

11363
09:28:12,520 --> 09:28:13,700
I'm fucking...

11364
09:28:13,700 --> 09:28:15,300
I'm settling with 150.

11365
09:28:15,940 --> 09:28:17,700
And tomorrow we go again.

11366
09:28:18,440 --> 09:28:20,200
Tomorrow we go again.

11367
09:28:20,800 --> 09:28:21,580
To 250.

11368
09:28:23,000 --> 09:28:23,700
Maybe...

11369
09:28:23,700 --> 09:28:25,420
No, I should just aim 200.

11370
09:28:25,540 --> 09:28:27,340
I will aim for 200 tomorrow.

11371
09:28:28,340 --> 09:28:30,780
Today we aim for 150.

11372
09:28:31,200 --> 09:28:32,340
And then tomorrow...

11373
09:28:33,120 --> 09:28:34,340
We aim for 250.

11374
09:28:35,640 --> 09:28:36,480
And then...

11375
09:28:36,480 --> 09:28:37,880
We should be secured.

11376
09:28:38,180 --> 09:28:39,920
And then after that...

11377
09:28:39,920 --> 09:28:42,380
We can come back to YouTube.

11378
09:28:43,060 --> 09:28:45,540
And then we'll be back on YouTube.

11379
09:28:47,860 --> 09:28:48,660
Sorry.

11380
09:28:49,360 --> 09:28:51,360
Tomorrow as in today.

11381
09:28:51,880 --> 09:28:53,520
So later today...

11382
09:28:53,520 --> 09:28:54,140
I don't know.

11383
09:28:54,140 --> 09:28:56,120
I don't want to promise you guys anything.

11384
09:28:56,260 --> 09:28:58,820
I don't know what my life is going to be like later today.

11385
09:29:00,400 --> 09:29:02,580
I don't know what my life is...

11386
09:29:02,580 --> 09:29:05,320
I could be a whole different person later today.

11387
09:29:08,220 --> 09:29:09,280
Toki, imagine...

11388
09:29:09,280 --> 09:29:11,580
That's what I'm trying to do!

11389
09:29:12,440 --> 09:29:14,140
I'm trying to be...

11390
09:29:15,120 --> 09:29:16,420
What a bubble!

11391
09:29:16,420 --> 09:29:18,580
What happened?

11392
09:29:22,840 --> 09:29:24,280
Oh my god.

11393
09:29:24,880 --> 09:29:26,420
I've been trying.

11394
09:29:26,680 --> 09:29:28,840
I swear, I've been trying.

11395
09:29:33,940 --> 09:29:35,360
Oh my god.

11396
09:29:36,000 --> 09:29:37,420
It's okay, it's not us.

11397
09:29:37,760 --> 09:29:39,660
I don't think it was a me issue.

11398
09:29:42,360 --> 09:29:43,540
Can't be me.

11399
09:29:43,540 --> 09:29:45,220
It's never me.

11400
09:29:47,540 --> 09:29:48,380
No.

11401
09:29:49,740 --> 09:29:51,500
It's society's fault.

11402
09:29:53,420 --> 09:29:55,940
Can't be, it's never me.

11403
09:29:57,600 --> 09:29:58,860
This has been like...

11404
09:29:58,860 --> 09:30:00,340
Oh my god, this hurts actually.

11405
09:30:02,020 --> 09:30:03,960
This actually hurts a lot.

11406
09:30:05,460 --> 09:30:08,580
What a fucking shitty record.

11407
09:30:08,580 --> 09:30:08,820
What a shitty record.

11408
09:30:13,400 --> 09:30:15,960
Exactly, I'm never the problem.

11409
09:30:16,360 --> 09:30:17,480
My pain.

11410
09:30:20,900 --> 09:30:22,000
Oh my god.

11411
09:30:24,680 --> 09:30:25,800
That's also...

11412
09:30:25,800 --> 09:30:27,720
That's my record.

11413
09:30:29,220 --> 09:30:30,920
You're right, it's...

11414
09:30:30,920 --> 09:30:32,200
It's a 2 ping issue.

11415
09:30:32,380 --> 09:30:33,440
Can we see your win rate?

11416
09:30:33,680 --> 09:30:36,660
You think I'm fucking ashamed of my win rate?

11417
09:30:36,660 --> 09:30:40,520
I have a 53% win rate on Luna.

11418
09:30:41,060 --> 09:30:42,880
Because I play way too much.

11419
09:30:43,260 --> 09:30:45,600
Okay guys, is this what you wanted me to say?

11420
09:30:46,380 --> 09:30:48,900
I have a 64% win rate on Mantis.

11421
09:30:49,380 --> 09:30:51,660
I have a 30% win rate on Cloak.

11422
09:30:51,900 --> 09:30:54,540
I have a 55% win rate on Adam.

11423
09:30:54,940 --> 09:30:56,960
And then everything else, I don't care.

11424
09:31:05,240 --> 09:31:06,360
I just...

11425
09:31:06,360 --> 09:31:08,120
It's because I play way too much.

11426
09:31:08,460 --> 09:31:09,780
I played so much.

11427
09:31:09,920 --> 09:31:11,660
And I was hard stuck GM.

11428
09:31:12,520 --> 09:31:15,060
For the longest time.

11429
09:31:15,820 --> 09:31:16,820
I was like...

11430
09:31:16,820 --> 09:31:19,900
I was stuck in GM for like a week.

11431
09:31:20,820 --> 09:31:21,640
I think.

11432
09:31:21,780 --> 09:31:23,860
Yeah, I was stuck in GM for a fucking week.

11433
09:31:23,860 --> 09:31:26,680
And it was the roughest time of my life.

11434
09:31:27,800 --> 09:31:29,860
My lobbies are so cursed.

11435
09:31:30,900 --> 09:31:34,720
I've had some of the most fucked up lobbies doing this grind.

11436
09:31:39,030 --> 09:31:41,650
My lobbies are actually so fucked up.

11437
09:31:46,780 --> 09:31:48,080
One thing can only...

11438
09:31:48,080 --> 09:31:49,960
Only one thing can make me happy.

11439
09:31:51,120 --> 09:31:53,040
Who do you hate on your team the most?

11440
09:31:56,220 --> 09:31:57,540
God, there's so much hating.

11441
09:31:57,540 --> 09:31:57,580
There's so much hating.

11442
09:31:59,960 --> 09:32:01,880
Sorry, I need to get a list.

11443
09:32:02,460 --> 09:32:04,640
I need a list.

11444
09:32:05,800 --> 09:32:08,180
There's so much hating me.

11445
09:32:13,320 --> 09:32:15,420
Who do I not hate?

11446
09:32:15,540 --> 09:32:16,460
That's so true.

11447
09:32:17,020 --> 09:32:18,740
Who do I not fucking hate?

11448
09:32:18,740 --> 09:32:18,840
Who do I not fucking hate?

11449
09:32:27,010 --> 09:32:31,230
Do we have a Storm one trick?

11450
09:32:31,690 --> 09:32:33,470
I think we ban...

11451
09:32:33,470 --> 09:32:34,630
I think we ban Storm.

11452
09:32:37,970 --> 09:32:39,830
Let's just ban Storm.

11453
09:32:44,570 --> 09:32:46,050
I mean, we ban Hella.

11454
09:32:46,470 --> 09:32:48,450
I mean, Krogi can play whatever the fuck he wants.

11455
09:32:48,650 --> 09:32:49,430
I mean, he can play Punisher.

11456
09:32:49,430 --> 09:32:53,190
Yeah, but I think he played Ironman his entire way...

11457
09:32:53,190 --> 09:32:53,830
...up...

11458
09:32:55,210 --> 09:32:55,770
...GM...

11459
09:32:55,770 --> 09:32:56,710
...by Emberwell.

11460
09:32:57,330 --> 09:32:58,450
It's a bit his main.

11461
09:33:01,370 --> 09:33:03,070
Yeah, they would ban the same shit.

11462
09:33:03,230 --> 09:33:04,810
They would play...

11463
09:33:04,810 --> 09:33:06,210
They also have...

11464
09:33:08,490 --> 09:33:09,850
We're banning Ironman.

11465
09:33:10,290 --> 09:33:13,510
Yeah, but Defran got off.

11466
09:33:13,930 --> 09:33:16,070
So I don't have to fucking worry about Ironfist anymore.

11467
09:33:16,670 --> 09:33:17,410
That fucker.

11468
09:33:27,910 --> 09:33:28,830
Me too.

11469
09:33:29,150 --> 09:33:30,670
I hope I get to 150.

11470
09:33:30,870 --> 09:33:31,410
I've settled.

11471
09:33:34,790 --> 09:33:35,250
Storm?

11472
09:33:41,150 --> 09:33:42,070
Jesus Christ.

11473
09:33:43,830 --> 09:33:45,130
I mean, what does this guy play?

11474
09:33:48,590 --> 09:33:51,210
Yeah, you see, he plays Mike.

11475
09:33:53,710 --> 09:33:54,670
Krogi is amazing.

11476
09:33:54,790 --> 09:33:55,630
Who said that?

11477
09:33:55,750 --> 09:33:56,470
Do you have hat?

11478
09:33:56,550 --> 09:33:57,050
I'm sorry.

11479
09:33:57,130 --> 09:33:57,530
I'm sorry.

11480
09:33:57,890 --> 09:34:00,270
My hate is coming out right now.

11481
09:34:00,670 --> 09:34:03,770
My hate is coming out.

11482
09:34:09,440 --> 09:34:10,920
Don't keep chill.

11483
09:34:16,720 --> 09:34:19,700
Sorry, I'm like this close to starting something.

11484
09:34:19,700 --> 09:34:21,480
Oh, it's fucking...

11485
09:34:22,380 --> 09:34:27,240
No, Rocket is fucking terrible in high elo.

11486
09:34:27,340 --> 09:34:28,840
Oh, I can't wait to win another game.

11487
09:34:28,840 --> 09:34:29,840
It's actually a troll.

11488
09:34:31,960 --> 09:34:34,460
Yeah, we can't end on a win, right?

11489
09:34:34,680 --> 09:34:36,920
We can't end on a win.

11490
09:34:39,060 --> 09:34:40,620
She's going full elo.

11491
09:34:41,720 --> 09:34:43,360
Are you gonna donate them?

11492
09:34:44,500 --> 09:34:46,180
Where did I even put this orb on?

11493
09:34:46,180 --> 09:34:46,840
I think she's gone.

11494
09:34:46,840 --> 09:34:47,100
Oh my god.

11495
09:34:49,480 --> 09:34:51,160
I think she might be asleep.

11496
09:34:51,500 --> 09:34:52,140
Who am I?

11497
09:34:52,360 --> 09:34:54,060
Oh shit, is he talking to me?

11498
09:34:54,460 --> 09:34:55,840
Oh my god, I'm so...

11499
09:34:56,360 --> 09:34:57,960
I am...

11500
09:34:58,860 --> 09:35:01,540
I didn't even realize he was talking to me.

11501
09:35:03,920 --> 09:35:05,120
I couldn't even register.

11502
09:35:06,460 --> 09:35:10,100
Wait, there's a Black Panther.

11503
09:35:11,920 --> 09:35:12,980
There's Hulk on us.

11504
09:35:14,160 --> 09:35:16,880
Oh my god, I'm sorry, Mantis.

11505
09:35:19,440 --> 09:35:20,680
I'm sorry.

11506
09:35:21,660 --> 09:35:23,500
I think I need to go back there.

11507
09:35:23,720 --> 09:35:25,280
No, not Wakanda.

11508
09:35:29,860 --> 09:35:32,480
We're coming back.

11509
09:35:40,160 --> 09:35:41,500
Storm, stop.

11510
09:35:41,740 --> 09:35:42,740
Storm, please.

11511
09:35:42,900 --> 09:35:45,000
I've been streaming for nine hours, Storm.

11512
09:35:47,200 --> 09:35:48,320
There's a Black Panther on me.

11513
09:35:48,680 --> 09:35:49,440
I need heals.

11514
09:35:53,140 --> 09:35:53,780
I have ult here.

11515
09:35:55,780 --> 09:35:58,280
I can ult in and then we'll keep Mantis ult for defensive.

11516
09:35:59,400 --> 09:35:59,900
Can we do it?

11517
09:36:01,480 --> 09:36:02,520
Oh, yeah, it's fine.

11518
09:36:07,680 --> 09:36:08,760
I'm with my Magneto.

11519
09:36:10,320 --> 09:36:10,740
How are you fighting?

11520
09:36:11,600 --> 09:36:12,660
No ult, no ult, no ult.

11521
09:36:13,820 --> 09:36:14,500
I have...

11522
09:36:19,040 --> 09:36:19,580
I'm scared.

11523
09:36:19,800 --> 09:36:20,560
I'm scared.

11524
09:36:20,620 --> 09:36:21,960
There's a Black Panther behind us.

11525
09:36:26,160 --> 09:36:27,240
I froze Hulk.

11526
09:36:35,550 --> 09:36:36,630
Use Punisher.

11527
09:36:37,490 --> 09:36:38,770
Yeah, then use both DPS ults.

11528
09:36:41,370 --> 09:36:42,250
Hanzo, Hanzo.

11529
09:36:42,570 --> 09:36:44,010
They have Hulk ult here.

11530
09:36:45,330 --> 09:36:46,290
I'm dead, I'm dead.

11531
09:36:46,290 --> 09:36:47,470
I don't have flash.

11532
09:36:50,890 --> 09:36:51,650
I'm baiting.

11533
09:36:53,650 --> 09:36:54,830
I froze Hulk, I froze Hulk.

11534
09:36:55,610 --> 09:36:56,470
He has ult, he has ult.

11535
09:36:57,430 --> 09:36:59,050
Black Panther is back, back to the ramp.

11536
09:36:59,050 --> 09:36:59,750
He's on support.

11537
09:37:02,230 --> 09:37:02,990
He's still on me.

11538
09:37:04,130 --> 09:37:05,650
I might be dead.

11539
09:37:07,550 --> 09:37:08,330
We have something, we have something.

11540
09:37:10,570 --> 09:37:12,190
I couldn't do anything.

11541
09:37:16,290 --> 09:37:17,270
Black Panther.

11542
09:37:20,250 --> 09:37:21,810
Support's coming over now.

11543
09:37:22,810 --> 09:37:24,290
Peek our Mantis if needed.

11544
09:37:34,470 --> 09:37:36,070
My Hulk.

11545
09:37:39,230 --> 09:37:40,750
There's a Punisher top right.

11546
09:37:46,620 --> 09:37:48,300
Oh my god, I'm pushing up.

11547
09:37:48,440 --> 09:37:49,500
I'm fucking subbed.

11548
09:37:49,540 --> 09:37:51,020
I'm so locked in.

11549
09:37:52,360 --> 09:37:53,520
Stop saying I'm Groot.

11550
09:37:54,040 --> 09:37:54,880
I'm Groot.

11551
09:37:58,400 --> 09:37:59,820
I am Groot.

11552
09:38:00,000 --> 09:38:03,140
I am Groot, I am Groot, I am Groot.

11553
09:38:07,140 --> 09:38:09,300
We can Mantis ult first if needed.

11554
09:38:14,680 --> 09:38:15,180
I am Groot.

11555
09:38:15,180 --> 09:38:16,700
Oh my god, Hulk is on you.

11556
09:38:19,340 --> 09:38:20,660
Black Panther is on us too.

11557
09:38:25,440 --> 09:38:27,180
Black Panther is half, Black Panther is one.

11558
09:38:29,420 --> 09:38:30,360
I am Groot.

11559
09:38:31,400 --> 09:38:32,320
I am Groot.

11560
09:38:32,980 --> 09:38:33,900
I am Groot.

11561
09:38:34,180 --> 09:38:34,360
Kill him.

11562
09:38:37,440 --> 09:38:40,040
Oh my god, that 2-ping is hitting hard right now.

11563
09:38:41,880 --> 09:38:43,460
That was bad.

11564
09:38:43,600 --> 09:38:45,120
I hope I don't need that freeze.

11565
09:38:47,800 --> 09:38:50,620
I hope I don't need that freeze, lady.

11566
09:38:54,240 --> 09:38:57,280
Oh man, that would be so awkward.

11567
09:38:59,440 --> 09:39:00,640
I got you, I got you, I got you.

11568
09:39:03,880 --> 09:39:04,880
I don't know.

11569
09:39:05,200 --> 09:39:06,080
We don't need ult here.

11570
09:39:06,780 --> 09:39:07,440
Rocket, Rocket?

11571
09:39:07,880 --> 09:39:09,320
Oh, you need ult, never mind.

11572
09:39:13,800 --> 09:39:15,180
I got you, I got you.

11573
09:39:17,100 --> 09:39:20,320
3, 2, 1, backing up.

11574
09:39:22,160 --> 09:39:23,440
Black Panther on me.

11575
09:39:24,400 --> 09:39:27,380
Black Panther is still... he's half.

11576
09:39:28,800 --> 09:39:29,700
Bucky low, Bucky low.

11577
09:39:34,160 --> 09:39:35,080
Hulk, Hulk.

11578
09:39:37,580 --> 09:39:39,060
Oh my god.

11579
09:39:39,880 --> 09:39:42,380
Lunch break, it's 8 in the morning.

11580
09:39:43,080 --> 09:39:44,320
I am Groot.

11581
09:39:44,460 --> 09:39:45,320
I am Groot.

11582
09:39:46,340 --> 09:39:51,420
I am Groot, this is why I hate trees.

11583
09:39:54,580 --> 09:39:56,560
In game, in game, guys, in game.

11584
09:39:56,680 --> 09:39:57,560
I would never...

11585
09:39:58,380 --> 09:40:04,000
If I had a choice to burn a tree down right now, in game...

11586
09:40:08,780 --> 09:40:10,100
Hulk is low.

11587
09:40:14,060 --> 09:40:16,000
Oh, stay where our man is, he can't...

11588
09:40:21,280 --> 09:40:23,720
It's not time for his walkies.

11589
09:40:24,660 --> 09:40:26,660
I'm not fucking walking him early.

11590
09:40:26,820 --> 09:40:29,800
He's gonna be a little bitch if I walk him early.

11591
09:40:29,940 --> 09:40:33,100
Then he's gonna fucking think he gets walks early every time.

11592
09:40:34,840 --> 09:40:36,300
He has a schedule.

11593
09:40:43,780 --> 09:40:45,560
This is real firepower.

11594
09:40:45,560 --> 09:40:48,440
Jesus Christ, how did I keep him up Alaska this long?

11595
09:40:50,840 --> 09:40:52,260
Oh, I'm so dead.

11596
09:40:53,100 --> 09:40:54,080
We need to rotate, we need to rotate, we need to rotate.

11597
09:40:57,900 --> 09:40:59,140
Oh, we got Hulk, we got Hulk.

11598
09:41:01,280 --> 09:41:01,940
Nice, nice.

11599
09:41:02,000 --> 09:41:03,320
Okay, you're just down two.

11600
09:41:05,020 --> 09:41:09,660
Oh, that's a huge ult.

11601
09:41:09,920 --> 09:41:10,860
You are Groot, bro.

11602
09:41:11,580 --> 09:41:13,160
You're Grooting it.

11603
09:41:14,020 --> 09:41:15,300
I love it when he Groots.

11604
09:41:15,820 --> 09:41:16,740
And he Groots all over?

11605
09:41:18,340 --> 09:41:19,640
Yeah, he Groots all over them, bro.

11606
09:41:22,700 --> 09:41:23,780
Okay, I still have my ult.

11607
09:41:27,120 --> 09:41:27,940
I don't see you.

11608
09:41:37,240 --> 09:41:38,400
There's an Immortar left.

11609
09:41:39,360 --> 09:41:40,640
I have ult this.

11610
09:41:41,980 --> 09:41:44,520
Oh, we lost two, that's unfortunate.

11611
09:41:49,520 --> 09:41:52,320
Oh, I'm backing out now, Groot.

11612
09:41:58,440 --> 09:42:03,680
We still have their support ults.

11613
09:42:09,940 --> 09:42:12,640
It's in your Mantis.

11614
09:42:13,380 --> 09:42:15,480
Jesus Christ!

11615
09:42:17,960 --> 09:42:20,060
I froze the Hulk.

11616
09:42:22,220 --> 09:42:23,140
Why?

11617
09:42:23,860 --> 09:42:24,080
Why?

11618
09:42:27,840 --> 09:42:29,440
Let's fight.

11619
09:42:29,660 --> 09:42:33,360
Again, again.

11620
09:42:34,120 --> 09:42:34,580
Okay.

11621
09:42:36,160 --> 09:42:37,880
I think we can go.

11622
09:42:38,580 --> 09:42:41,620
I don't think we can touch that.

11623
09:42:43,300 --> 09:42:44,520
It's a little bit hard.

11624
09:42:47,420 --> 09:42:48,040
Again,

11625
09:42:55,240 --> 09:42:56,180
and again.

11626
09:42:56,980 --> 09:42:59,880
I think against Dark Horde, we need to play...

11627
09:43:00,250 --> 09:43:02,640
We need to play Mag...

11628
09:43:03,260 --> 09:43:04,220
Mag Strange.

11629
09:43:04,460 --> 09:43:05,320
I don't think she's Mag Strange.

11630
09:43:06,500 --> 09:43:07,580
I think Groot is fine.

11631
09:43:08,620 --> 09:43:09,720
I think he's doing good.

11632
09:43:10,100 --> 09:43:10,840
Stay Groot, bro.

11633
09:43:11,600 --> 09:43:13,080
He is doing the best he can.

11634
09:43:13,500 --> 09:43:15,280
Yes, we're gonna lose our brain cells together.

11635
09:43:15,680 --> 09:43:16,720
We don't need them, right?

11636
09:43:17,380 --> 09:43:18,680
We don't need them.

11637
09:43:18,760 --> 09:43:20,300
We're just here to play Marvel Rivals.

11638
09:43:20,800 --> 09:43:21,880
What do you need your Marv...

11639
09:43:21,880 --> 09:43:23,400
What do you need Marv...

11640
09:43:23,860 --> 09:43:26,500
Oh my god, I can't even force sentences.

11641
09:43:28,800 --> 09:43:34,500
Sorry, what do you need brain cells for if you have Marvel Rivals?

11642
09:43:35,100 --> 09:43:36,940
It took me three times.

11643
09:43:37,080 --> 09:43:40,700
It only took me three tries to make the correct sentence.

11644
09:43:42,160 --> 09:43:44,720
Oh my god, why the fuck are...

11645
09:43:44,720 --> 09:43:47,500
Mattis, I'm already having a rough time.

11646
09:43:53,310 --> 09:43:55,130
Where's our other DP?

11647
09:43:55,250 --> 09:43:56,270
Okay, you don't need...

11648
09:43:56,270 --> 09:43:58,190
Actually, I'm just gonna put on fucking Groot.

11649
09:43:58,850 --> 09:44:02,350
Our Groot is like actually gonna die if I don't...

11650
09:44:04,270 --> 09:44:05,990
No brain, just Marvel.

11651
09:44:07,070 --> 09:44:07,710
Marvel my rivals.

11652
09:44:14,470 --> 09:44:15,670
I miss...

11653
09:44:15,670 --> 09:44:17,470
I miss winning.

11654
09:44:18,250 --> 09:44:19,310
What was that like?

11655
09:44:26,370 --> 09:44:29,050
What was that like, guys?

11656
09:44:33,510 --> 09:44:34,470
I'm on him, I'm on him.

11657
09:44:34,670 --> 09:44:35,350
He's coming from behind.

11658
09:44:36,270 --> 09:44:37,130
Yeah, he's on me.

11659
09:44:37,370 --> 09:44:38,350
He's behind us.

11660
09:44:40,170 --> 09:44:40,830
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.

11661
09:44:42,410 --> 09:44:44,070
Hulk is on me, please, any help?

11662
09:44:46,850 --> 09:44:47,410
I'm here.

11663
09:44:48,930 --> 09:44:51,010
You only have Mantis heals.

11664
09:44:54,210 --> 09:44:56,190
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

11665
09:44:56,270 --> 09:45:00,150
I woke him up too because I was so scared.

11666
09:45:03,130 --> 09:45:05,650
I accidentally woke him up.

11667
09:45:07,350 --> 09:45:08,130
Another one?

11668
09:45:10,230 --> 09:45:11,610
I'm back spot, I'm back spot.

11669
09:45:11,690 --> 09:45:12,150
We need to regroup.

11670
09:45:14,910 --> 09:45:16,110
Jesus Christ.

11671
09:45:16,890 --> 09:45:18,690
This storm is not it.

11672
09:45:19,030 --> 09:45:20,610
This storm is not it.

11673
09:45:22,110 --> 09:45:23,890
This storm is not it.

11674
09:45:25,150 --> 09:45:25,830
He's Grooting.

11675
09:45:27,310 --> 09:45:29,450
Oh my god, I am Groot.

11676
09:45:29,810 --> 09:45:31,350
I am Groot.

11677
09:45:32,350 --> 09:45:33,370
Another one?

11678
09:45:37,390 --> 09:45:39,490
Don't worry, they're in a line.

11679
09:45:39,930 --> 09:45:43,110
Don't worry, they're in a line.

11680
09:45:44,290 --> 09:45:48,690
I'm worrying, I'm worrying, I'm worrying right now.

11681
09:45:48,690 --> 09:45:49,570
One more.

11682
09:45:52,030 --> 09:45:55,830
How do you have fun playing one of the...

11683
09:45:55,830 --> 09:46:02,990
How do you... How do you have fun playing one of the worst characters in this lobby?

11684
09:46:03,730 --> 09:46:04,050
How?

11685
09:46:05,030 --> 09:46:06,950
How do you have fun?

11686
09:46:08,490 --> 09:46:10,350
What makes you happy?

11687
09:46:13,970 --> 09:46:16,950
Nice, nice, nice.

11688
09:46:18,690 --> 09:46:23,710
How do you... What makes you happy in life?

11689
09:46:27,660 --> 09:46:31,900
Oh my god, you guys take so much damage.

11690
09:46:33,460 --> 09:46:36,400
You guys take so much damage.

11691
09:46:37,680 --> 09:46:40,520
How do you feel joy in life?

11692
09:46:43,700 --> 09:46:47,080
Why would you make this harder for yourself?

11693
09:46:49,760 --> 09:46:52,160
I don't know about happy.

11694
09:46:55,640 --> 09:47:00,760
I'm just thinking like, why would you ever make this game harder for yourself?

11695
09:47:03,120 --> 09:47:03,720
Like...

11696
09:47:06,880 --> 09:47:12,320
How do you wake up at night knowing you're playing one of the shittiest characters in Marvel Rivals?

11697
09:47:13,080 --> 09:47:13,580
How?

11698
09:47:17,940 --> 09:47:19,840
Where does it come from?

11699
09:47:21,780 --> 09:47:23,420
Oh, that was the wrong prediction.

11700
09:47:23,640 --> 09:47:25,100
I predicted that fucking wrong.

11701
09:47:25,940 --> 09:47:28,900
I am 80... 92%.

11702
09:47:31,620 --> 09:47:32,940
I'll call a 1v1.

11703
09:47:36,920 --> 09:47:37,960
I have it.

11704
09:47:38,260 --> 09:47:38,700
I have ult.

11705
09:47:41,040 --> 09:47:42,360
I'm on the point.

11706
09:47:42,520 --> 09:47:43,080
I'm on the point.

11707
09:47:44,940 --> 09:47:49,400
Guys, I... Oh my god, I'm so excited to fight this for four more minutes.

11708
09:47:49,660 --> 09:47:51,220
If we're lucky, it'd be two.

11709
09:47:55,260 --> 09:47:56,500
If we're lucky.

11710
09:47:57,960 --> 09:47:59,800
We just have to do this for two minutes.

11711
09:48:05,790 --> 09:48:07,830
She's not... Hulk is frozen.

11712
09:48:10,110 --> 09:48:11,890
He's actually so low.

11713
09:48:14,070 --> 09:48:17,370
I'm trying so hard to keep... Oh my god.

11714
09:48:17,610 --> 09:48:19,350
I have Hulk on me and he has 1 HP.

11715
09:48:22,090 --> 09:48:23,350
I'm solo healing.

11716
09:48:25,410 --> 09:48:27,110
It was nice knowing you, booger.

11717
09:48:29,930 --> 09:48:30,910
It's nice.

11718
09:48:32,910 --> 09:48:36,950
Guys, I knew it.

11719
09:48:37,530 --> 09:48:38,330
Two minutes.

11720
09:48:40,390 --> 09:48:41,590
Two minutes.

11721
09:48:41,890 --> 09:48:45,050
One, two, two, three.

11722
09:48:48,550 --> 09:48:50,230
Oh my god.

11723
09:48:51,750 --> 09:48:54,070
Wow, you can't expect to win them all.

11724
09:48:56,690 --> 09:49:01,450
I had a feeling when we had that storm on our team...

11725
09:49:02,830 --> 09:49:04,550
That it might be rough.

11726
09:49:04,850 --> 09:49:06,110
That it might have been rough.

11727
09:49:06,490 --> 09:49:08,490
And it doesn't.

11728
09:49:08,490 --> 09:49:11,490
I felt that...

11729
09:49:12,070 --> 09:49:13,470
I could feel it.

11730
09:49:13,510 --> 09:49:14,490
I was like...

11731
09:49:17,430 --> 09:49:19,850
Is this doom queuing?

11732
09:49:20,550 --> 09:49:23,010
I wouldn't say doom queuing.

11733
09:49:24,310 --> 09:49:26,490
I would say...

11734
09:49:28,390 --> 09:49:30,710
I would say that I am here.

11735
09:49:32,370 --> 09:49:33,790
I think they have the storm player.

11736
09:49:34,450 --> 09:49:35,890
They do have the storm player.

11737
09:49:36,030 --> 09:49:38,790
But the question is, do we want to ban storm or let them play storm?

11738
09:49:41,450 --> 09:49:43,250
I would say that I am here.

11739
09:49:44,970 --> 09:49:45,850
10 hours?

11740
09:49:46,030 --> 09:49:47,790
I have 10 hours and I made...

11741
09:49:48,790 --> 09:49:51,430
Guys, at least I'm not down, you know?

11742
09:49:51,930 --> 09:49:52,790
At least I'm not...

11743
09:49:56,790 --> 09:49:59,190
It's the little things, guys.

11744
09:49:59,750 --> 09:50:01,650
It's the small things.

11745
09:50:01,650 --> 09:50:04,950
At least we're not under.

11746
09:50:12,950 --> 09:50:14,750
Only positive here.

11747
09:50:20,580 --> 09:50:21,580
No more.

11748
09:50:26,180 --> 09:50:27,840
I can punish her.

11749
09:50:28,000 --> 09:50:28,560
I don't wanna have her.

11750
09:50:29,380 --> 09:50:30,100
Yo,

11751
09:50:33,200 --> 09:50:34,360
2 ping is insane.

11752
09:50:35,400 --> 09:50:36,160
I know, right?

11753
09:50:37,160 --> 09:50:39,660
I got my 2 ping right here.

11754
09:50:45,790 --> 09:50:46,390
Yup.

11755
09:50:48,190 --> 09:50:49,650
I want my liquid.

11756
09:50:51,970 --> 09:50:53,670
How the fuck am I getting...

11757
09:50:54,110 --> 09:50:55,530
How the fuck...

11758
09:50:55,530 --> 09:50:57,810
I'm getting target banned.

11759
09:50:58,130 --> 09:51:01,570
I don't get it.

11760
09:51:01,890 --> 09:51:03,610
I've been so nice to people.

11761
09:51:04,290 --> 09:51:06,370
Maybe it's time to not be nice anymore.

11762
09:51:06,810 --> 09:51:08,350
And be like, you've been nice?

11763
09:51:13,410 --> 09:51:13,950
No.

11764
09:51:13,950 --> 09:51:17,410
I've been so nice to everybody.

11765
09:51:20,210 --> 09:51:21,290
It's over.

11766
09:51:21,550 --> 09:51:22,330
It's time to hate.

11767
09:51:23,290 --> 09:51:24,670
It's fucking over.

11768
09:51:25,810 --> 09:51:29,190
What if I just like... Wait, but then they can just watch my teammates.

11769
09:51:29,670 --> 09:51:34,750
I was like, what if I just cover my screen so they can't even figure out what they...

11770
09:51:34,750 --> 09:51:38,750
But I'm like, I've been streaming for 10 hours so they know exactly what my teammates are playing.

11771
09:51:39,530 --> 09:51:40,190
Guys, listen.

11772
09:51:41,030 --> 09:51:42,450
Why do we fall down?

11773
09:51:43,650 --> 09:51:44,010
Gravity.

11774
09:51:50,440 --> 09:51:52,340
We're so close to 150.

11775
09:51:53,280 --> 09:51:54,060
I believe.

11776
09:51:55,440 --> 09:51:56,500
I believe.

11777
09:51:59,380 --> 09:52:00,500
I believe.

11778
09:52:03,040 --> 09:52:05,000
It's so possible.

11779
09:52:07,180 --> 09:52:09,520
It's so possible.

11780
09:52:14,360 --> 09:52:16,340
Guys, it's because you guys stopped believing.

11781
09:52:16,840 --> 09:52:17,640
They can grab Storm.

11782
09:52:17,960 --> 09:52:18,540
I'm solo.

11783
09:52:18,960 --> 09:52:19,800
I can set up this.

11784
09:52:20,100 --> 09:52:20,500
Oh, good.

11785
09:52:21,400 --> 09:52:21,700
I'm looking.

11786
09:52:21,840 --> 09:52:21,940
I'm looking.

11787
09:52:22,020 --> 09:52:22,340
I'm looking now.

11788
09:52:22,660 --> 09:52:23,120
Thor's low.

11789
09:52:23,240 --> 09:52:23,420
Thor.

11790
09:52:23,500 --> 09:52:23,640
Thor.

11791
09:52:23,820 --> 09:52:23,820
Thor.

11792
09:52:24,540 --> 09:52:25,400
Oh my god.

11793
09:52:26,740 --> 09:52:26,980
Kill him.

11794
09:52:27,040 --> 09:52:27,320
Kill him.

11795
09:52:27,400 --> 09:52:27,640
Kill him.

11796
09:52:28,960 --> 09:52:29,680
It's fine.

11797
09:52:29,980 --> 09:52:30,240
Don't want.

11798
09:52:30,360 --> 09:52:30,480
Don't want.

11799
09:52:30,500 --> 09:52:30,700
Don't want.

11800
09:52:30,720 --> 09:52:30,880
Don't want.

11801
09:52:32,260 --> 09:52:33,680
Everybody is so healthy.

11802
09:52:33,680 --> 09:52:34,200
Oh my god.

11803
09:52:34,400 --> 09:52:37,540
Look how healthy everybody is.

11804
09:52:39,420 --> 09:52:40,820
Helios, I need us.

11805
09:52:41,040 --> 09:52:42,280
I need big energy here.

11806
09:52:43,540 --> 09:52:44,940
Yeah, I'm getting the big energy right now.

11807
09:52:45,020 --> 09:52:46,900
Helios, just turn on your monitor.

11808
09:52:48,640 --> 09:52:49,520
I'm turning on your monitor.

11809
09:52:49,540 --> 09:52:50,500
Turn on your monitor.

11810
09:52:50,500 --> 09:52:52,720
Honestly, you sound like you're going to fall asleep any second now.

11811
09:52:52,740 --> 09:52:55,120
No, I'm so locked in.

11812
09:52:59,420 --> 09:53:01,560
Our Mantis was not... I didn't die.

11813
09:53:07,160 --> 09:53:10,260
Can you guys peek me so I can not die?

11814
09:53:10,560 --> 09:53:13,140
Hello, here.

11815
09:53:13,720 --> 09:53:14,540
I can't see you.

11816
09:53:17,300 --> 09:53:18,660
Are you sure?

11817
09:53:18,860 --> 09:53:20,500
I'm definitely not the one that's tired.

11818
09:53:23,380 --> 09:53:24,460
What happened?

11819
09:53:35,380 --> 09:53:36,920
I'm going to... I have the ult in.

11820
09:53:37,020 --> 09:53:37,520
I'm ulting in.

11821
09:53:37,620 --> 09:53:38,020
I'm ulting in.

11822
09:53:38,500 --> 09:53:39,040
I'm on the point.

11823
09:53:39,140 --> 09:53:39,680
I'm on the point.

11824
09:53:43,620 --> 09:53:43,980
Please,

11825
09:53:48,840 --> 09:53:49,840
I need the TP too.

11826
09:53:57,000 --> 09:53:58,560
We got to regroup then.

11827
09:54:01,560 --> 09:54:02,920
There's someone to our left right here.

11828
09:54:07,100 --> 09:54:08,460
I froze Magneto.

11829
09:54:12,180 --> 09:54:13,620
That was...

11830
09:54:14,780 --> 09:54:16,640
That was very unfortunate.

11831
09:54:17,600 --> 09:54:17,820
I'm moving.

11832
09:54:17,920 --> 09:54:18,060
I'm moving.

11833
09:54:18,300 --> 09:54:18,440
I'm moving.

11834
09:54:18,840 --> 09:54:19,480
Reloading.

11835
09:54:23,880 --> 09:54:26,420
We have Mantis ult for it.

11836
09:54:27,180 --> 09:54:27,860
Nice.

11837
09:54:28,540 --> 09:54:29,080
Nice.

11838
09:54:29,120 --> 09:54:29,220
Nice.

11839
09:54:29,380 --> 09:54:29,380
Nice.

11840
09:54:29,480 --> 09:54:29,480
Nice.

11841
09:54:30,160 --> 09:54:31,180
I'm on Thor.

11842
09:54:31,180 --> 09:54:31,640
Thor half.

11843
09:54:33,140 --> 09:54:33,500
No fear.

11844
09:54:35,020 --> 09:54:35,540
No fear.

11845
09:54:41,270 --> 09:54:42,430
No more fear.

11846
09:54:47,370 --> 09:54:50,230
Our Mantis and I are not doing so well right now.

11847
09:54:52,870 --> 09:54:55,050
We have Thor on us.

11848
09:54:57,930 --> 09:54:58,930
Nice play.

11849
09:54:59,110 --> 09:54:59,110
Play.

11850
09:54:59,190 --> 09:54:59,190
Play.

11851
09:54:59,390 --> 09:55:00,230
Coming back now.

11852
09:55:00,330 --> 09:55:00,790
We're coming back.

11853
09:55:01,190 --> 09:55:02,710
They lost all their ultimates, I think.

11854
09:55:05,450 --> 09:55:06,450
I'm all here.

11855
09:55:17,900 --> 09:55:19,040
I'm locking in, guys.

11856
09:55:19,240 --> 09:55:21,780
I'm trying so fucking hard right now.

11857
09:55:21,920 --> 09:55:22,320
Psylocke.

11858
09:55:22,380 --> 09:55:22,540
Psylocke.

11859
09:55:22,580 --> 09:55:22,580
Psylocke.

11860
09:55:23,180 --> 09:55:23,580
Psylocke.

11861
09:55:23,580 --> 09:55:24,820
I'm reloading.

11862
09:55:24,820 --> 09:55:25,400
Psylocke one, babe.

11863
09:55:26,360 --> 09:55:26,480
Top.

11864
09:55:26,480 --> 09:55:26,840
Top.

11865
09:55:26,880 --> 09:55:26,880
Top.

11866
09:55:27,000 --> 09:55:27,000
Top.

11867
09:55:27,040 --> 09:55:27,060
Top.

11868
09:55:27,060 --> 09:55:27,100
Top.

11869
09:55:27,100 --> 09:55:27,660
I need top buff.

11870
09:55:27,880 --> 09:55:28,240
One top.

11871
09:55:28,240 --> 09:55:28,500
One top.

11872
09:55:28,500 --> 09:55:28,700
One top.

11873
09:55:28,740 --> 09:55:29,260
One top.

11874
09:55:29,380 --> 09:55:29,500
One top.

11875
09:55:29,540 --> 09:55:29,540
One top.

11876
09:55:29,540 --> 09:55:29,920
I got him.

11877
09:55:30,000 --> 09:55:30,400
Pugis.

11878
09:55:32,020 --> 09:55:32,420
Pugis.

11879
09:55:32,460 --> 09:55:32,680
Pugis.

11880
09:55:34,240 --> 09:55:34,640
Mag.

11881
09:55:34,700 --> 09:55:34,820
Mag.

11882
09:55:34,920 --> 09:55:35,120
Mag.

11883
09:55:35,120 --> 09:55:35,380
Mag.

11884
09:55:35,380 --> 09:55:35,560
Mag.

11885
09:55:35,560 --> 09:55:35,720
Mag.

11886
09:55:35,720 --> 09:55:35,820
Mag.

11887
09:55:35,820 --> 09:55:35,920
Mag.

11888
09:55:36,140 --> 09:55:37,440
Jesus Christ!

11889
09:55:39,880 --> 09:55:41,560
I get my ult!

11890
09:55:41,560 --> 09:55:41,740
No!

11891
09:55:43,060 --> 09:55:44,340
I'm fucking getting...

11892
09:55:49,260 --> 09:55:49,700
Oh...

11893
09:55:55,120 --> 09:55:56,800
There's a Psylocke up top.

11894
09:55:58,680 --> 09:56:00,080
I have a Psylocke on me.

11895
09:56:00,180 --> 09:56:00,940
I have a Psylocke on me.

11896
09:56:02,420 --> 09:56:03,180
He's over here.

11897
09:56:03,820 --> 09:56:04,360
He's one.

11898
09:56:04,580 --> 09:56:04,760
He's one.

11899
09:56:05,200 --> 09:56:05,680
Bye-bye.

11900
09:56:07,900 --> 09:56:09,460
Okay, I didn't want him to force it.

11901
09:56:10,940 --> 09:56:13,120
Like, I'm playing insane!

11902
09:56:17,910 --> 09:56:19,610
I'm fucking insane!

11903
09:56:21,210 --> 09:56:21,650
Shit.

11904
09:56:22,510 --> 09:56:22,830
I swore.

11905
09:56:22,970 --> 09:56:23,410
I swore.

11906
09:56:24,450 --> 09:56:25,290
I swore.

11907
09:56:26,030 --> 09:56:27,270
I swore.

11908
09:56:29,230 --> 09:56:29,670
Here.

11909
09:56:30,430 --> 09:56:30,830
I'm here.

11910
09:56:30,910 --> 09:56:31,110
I'm here.

11911
09:56:31,250 --> 09:56:31,510
I'm here.

11912
09:56:36,070 --> 09:56:36,950
Help her.

11913
09:56:36,950 --> 09:56:37,330
Help her.

11914
09:56:37,410 --> 09:56:37,710
Strange.

11915
09:56:37,770 --> 09:56:37,990
Help her.

11916
09:56:38,050 --> 09:56:38,210
Strange.

11917
09:56:38,270 --> 09:56:39,130
Help her.

11918
09:56:39,130 --> 09:56:39,690
It's fine.

11919
09:56:39,750 --> 09:56:40,010
It's fine.

11920
09:56:42,530 --> 09:56:43,370
Oh my god.

11921
09:56:45,370 --> 09:56:45,770
It's alright.

11922
09:56:46,150 --> 09:56:47,250
They have Psylocke ult here.

11923
09:56:54,690 --> 09:56:55,490
Jesus Christ.

11924
09:56:58,130 --> 09:57:00,170
I will fucking punch you down!

11925
09:57:00,630 --> 09:57:01,310
I'm sorry.

11926
09:57:02,910 --> 09:57:03,310
I'm gonna be.

11927
09:57:03,310 --> 09:57:03,590
I'm gonna be.

11928
09:57:03,690 --> 09:57:03,930
I'm gonna be.

11929
09:57:04,150 --> 09:57:04,930
Someone high ground.

11930
09:57:05,390 --> 09:57:05,590
Someone.

11931
09:57:05,650 --> 09:57:05,810
Someone.

11932
09:57:05,930 --> 09:57:06,090
Someone.

11933
09:57:06,270 --> 09:57:07,090
Someone if you want to be.

11934
09:57:08,670 --> 09:57:09,070
No.

11935
09:57:09,390 --> 09:57:09,530
No.

11936
09:57:09,770 --> 09:57:09,870
No.

11937
09:57:09,950 --> 09:57:10,050
No.

11938
09:57:10,130 --> 09:57:10,190
No.

11939
09:57:10,190 --> 09:57:11,970
I am ready to put on a show!

11940
09:57:13,110 --> 09:57:13,790
Akira?

11941
09:57:14,330 --> 09:57:14,950
Ah, fuck.

11942
09:57:15,550 --> 09:57:16,930
End game.

11943
09:57:17,070 --> 09:57:18,250
End game.

11944
09:57:22,770 --> 09:57:23,670
That's fine.

11945
09:57:24,230 --> 09:57:27,870
What is that?

11946
09:57:28,990 --> 09:57:31,750
Where is it?

11947
09:57:32,670 --> 09:57:33,890
Oh my god.

11948
09:57:33,910 --> 09:57:34,570
There it is.

11949
09:57:36,610 --> 09:57:38,170
Like, where is it?

11950
09:57:44,350 --> 09:57:44,950
He's ulting.

11951
09:57:45,050 --> 09:57:45,410
He's ulting.

11952
09:57:47,510 --> 09:57:48,470
Oh, no.

11953
09:57:50,730 --> 09:57:52,190
You have only Mantis heals.

11954
09:57:53,170 --> 09:57:53,870
I got Dilvo there.

11955
09:57:54,190 --> 09:57:54,410
I'm on.

11956
09:57:54,430 --> 09:57:54,730
I'm on.

11957
09:57:54,770 --> 09:57:54,970
I'm on.

11958
09:57:56,330 --> 09:57:57,370
We got two kills.

11959
09:57:57,950 --> 09:57:58,990
And Tori's on my ass.

11960
09:57:59,290 --> 09:57:59,550
In spawn.

11961
09:58:00,270 --> 09:58:01,190
We're coming back now.

11962
09:58:01,290 --> 09:58:01,650
We're coming back.

11963
09:58:01,750 --> 09:58:02,370
He's chasing me, guys.

11964
09:58:02,390 --> 09:58:03,130
He's chasing me.

11965
09:58:03,370 --> 09:58:04,130
I think he's coming back now.

11966
09:58:04,770 --> 09:58:05,130
I'm back now.

11967
09:58:05,230 --> 09:58:05,410
I'm back now.

11968
09:58:05,710 --> 09:58:05,990
I'm here.

11969
09:58:06,210 --> 09:58:06,230
I'm here.

11970
09:58:07,210 --> 09:58:07,810
I'm here.

11971
09:58:08,730 --> 09:58:09,250
I'm here.

11972
09:58:11,370 --> 09:58:12,090
Look at Tor.

11973
09:58:12,130 --> 09:58:12,350
Look at Tor.

11974
09:58:12,410 --> 09:58:13,170
Look at Tor.

11975
09:58:13,290 --> 09:58:13,630
Tor one.

11976
09:58:13,690 --> 09:58:13,890
Tor one.

11977
09:58:14,050 --> 09:58:14,210
Tor one.

11978
09:58:15,190 --> 09:58:15,830
Tor solo.

11979
09:58:16,790 --> 09:58:17,110
Tor solo.

11980
09:58:17,110 --> 09:58:17,650
Tor has no passive.

11981
09:58:20,090 --> 09:58:20,790
I'm coming back.

11982
09:58:21,050 --> 09:58:21,270
I'm coming back.

11983
09:58:22,770 --> 09:58:23,670
I froze him.

11984
09:58:23,810 --> 09:58:24,070
I froze him.

11985
09:58:24,270 --> 09:58:24,590
I'm almost there.

11986
09:58:24,710 --> 09:58:24,950
I'm almost there.

11987
09:58:26,550 --> 09:58:28,230
There's a Psylocke on us in the backline.

11988
09:58:28,390 --> 09:58:28,710
Psylocke one.

11989
09:58:28,770 --> 09:58:29,070
Psylocke one.

11990
09:58:29,190 --> 09:58:29,450
Psylocke one.

11991
09:58:30,550 --> 09:58:30,990
Oh, man.

11992
09:58:31,050 --> 09:58:31,430
Daluna is dead.

11993
09:58:31,490 --> 09:58:31,870
Daluna is dead.

11994
09:58:31,930 --> 09:58:32,350
Daluna is dead.

11995
09:58:32,890 --> 09:58:34,130
I'm on Storm.

11996
09:58:34,350 --> 09:58:35,490
The Storm is...

11997
09:58:37,010 --> 09:58:38,490
The Psylocke is still behind us.

11998
09:58:38,490 --> 09:58:39,050
I'm going to get Psylocke.

11999
09:58:44,550 --> 09:58:44,990
Psylocke.

12000
09:58:44,990 --> 09:58:44,990
Psylocke.

12001
09:58:44,990 --> 09:58:45,330
Psylocke.

12002
09:58:45,330 --> 09:58:45,670
Psylocke.

12003
09:58:45,670 --> 09:58:46,690
Oh, that's a good ult.

12004
09:58:46,790 --> 09:58:46,990
Nice.

12005
09:58:48,570 --> 09:58:49,250
Tor, Tor, Tor, Tor, Tor.

12006
09:58:49,250 --> 09:58:50,590
We have a four on us.

12007
09:58:52,290 --> 09:58:52,830
I'm low.

12008
09:58:53,510 --> 09:58:53,870
I'm fading.

12009
09:58:54,330 --> 09:58:54,530
I'm low.

12010
09:58:58,950 --> 09:58:59,710
You going fight?

12011
09:59:00,350 --> 09:59:01,270
I have to reload.

12012
09:59:02,930 --> 09:59:04,470
Oh, my god.

12013
09:59:04,530 --> 09:59:06,350
I played out of my fucking...

12014
09:59:08,200 --> 09:59:08,960
I meant this.

12015
09:59:08,960 --> 09:59:11,140
I can't leave!

12016
09:59:12,520 --> 09:59:14,560
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

12017
09:59:16,060 --> 09:59:18,500
I need to go pump you back, just leave me alone.

12018
09:59:20,900 --> 09:59:23,220
Jesus Christ, you're fucking welcome!

12019
09:59:26,180 --> 09:59:28,360
You're actual fucking welcome!

12020
09:59:28,700 --> 09:59:29,620
I got him, I got him, I got him.

12021
09:59:29,940 --> 09:59:31,020
I frozen two, I frozen two!

12022
09:59:33,480 --> 09:59:36,420
His lip is too pink.

12023
09:59:39,540 --> 09:59:41,200
Guys, it feels like 3 ping.

12024
09:59:41,300 --> 09:59:44,140
Not gonna lie, but it feels like 3 ping.

12025
09:59:44,960 --> 09:59:46,580
I know, it's actually crazy.

12026
09:59:46,700 --> 09:59:49,400
What's the point of paying for 5 if I'm getting 3 ping?

12027
09:59:50,200 --> 09:59:51,400
I can ult this.

12028
09:59:55,400 --> 09:59:59,060
I got you, I got you, I got you.

12029
09:59:59,520 --> 10:00:00,920
I'm damage boosting, I'm damage boosting this.

12030
10:00:03,840 --> 10:00:04,240
Change?

12031
10:00:04,480 --> 10:00:04,820
Nice.

12032
10:00:05,660 --> 10:00:06,200
Luna, Luna, Luna!

12033
10:00:08,960 --> 10:00:09,620
Alright.

12034
10:00:11,350 --> 10:00:12,360
It's fine.

12035
10:00:14,160 --> 10:00:15,460
Woo!

12036
10:00:20,260 --> 10:00:20,560
Woo!

12037
10:00:25,000 --> 10:00:26,300
No!

12038
10:00:29,480 --> 10:00:30,940
It's fine!

12039
10:00:31,400 --> 10:00:32,140
He doesn't know!

12040
10:00:32,940 --> 10:00:34,780
He doesn't know!

12041
10:00:36,320 --> 10:00:39,160
That felt like 3 ping right there.

12042
10:00:41,180 --> 10:00:41,820
I'm on Storm.

12043
10:00:43,040 --> 10:00:44,300
Storm 1, Storm 1!

12044
10:00:46,880 --> 10:00:47,460
Nice.

12045
10:00:48,940 --> 10:00:49,520
Nice.

12046
10:00:51,140 --> 10:00:53,420
Gamers, I think this is a genuine.

12047
10:00:56,860 --> 10:00:59,620
Guys, I feel like that felt like 3 ping.

12048
10:01:00,040 --> 10:01:03,100
I felt like it spiked to 3 ping there, I think.

12049
10:01:03,100 --> 10:01:05,100
Guys, oh my god.

12050
10:01:05,160 --> 10:01:06,580
I need to call my provider.

12051
10:01:06,840 --> 10:01:09,180
How could I be having 3 ping right now?

12052
10:01:09,600 --> 10:01:16,700
How could I be experiencing 3 ping after all the money I spent?

12053
10:01:21,660 --> 10:01:22,220
Insane.

12054
10:01:27,720 --> 10:01:28,840
Literally unplayable.

12055
10:01:30,500 --> 10:01:33,100
Literally fucking unplayable.

12056
10:01:33,180 --> 10:01:39,000
Guys, it's red.

12057
10:01:39,100 --> 10:01:41,800
Do you think it's bad that it's red?

12058
10:01:44,540 --> 10:01:47,160
Guys, why is it colored red?

12059
10:01:48,340 --> 10:01:49,680
This is my bad day.

12060
10:01:50,100 --> 10:01:52,120
Like, if I don't see it, like...

12061
10:02:01,820 --> 10:02:04,060
Guys, red equals good, right?

12062
10:02:04,800 --> 10:02:07,600
It's like, you know when you get band-aid and you put it over?

12063
10:02:07,820 --> 10:02:09,600
Like, it's like, you know, at your car.

12064
10:02:09,780 --> 10:02:12,860
And then your car is like, like you're saying it's dangerous.

12065
10:02:13,300 --> 10:02:15,720
And then you put a band-aid over the meter.

12066
10:02:15,980 --> 10:02:17,300
That's what I'm doing.

12067
10:02:17,940 --> 10:02:19,920
Red equals faster, right?

12068
10:02:20,800 --> 10:02:23,100
Red equals it goes faster.

12069
10:02:25,260 --> 10:02:27,940
Beaming tower, beaming tower, beaming tower.

12070
10:02:29,560 --> 10:02:30,940
Red for SR.

12071
10:02:31,900 --> 10:02:32,640
Next one, next one.

12072
10:02:35,820 --> 10:02:37,060
I'm pushing this tower.

12073
10:02:38,700 --> 10:02:39,240
Look at tower, look at tower.

12074
10:02:39,240 --> 10:02:39,580
Forza!

12075
10:02:44,580 --> 10:02:45,800
Keep pushing, keep pushing.

12076
10:02:46,440 --> 10:02:47,740
Okay, I'mma push up.

12077
10:02:49,540 --> 10:02:50,680
Psylocke in B.

12078
10:02:51,180 --> 10:02:51,860
Watch out behind.

12079
10:02:54,100 --> 10:02:58,740
Wait, I froze Psylocke.

12080
10:03:01,640 --> 10:03:03,700
Oh my god.

12081
10:03:04,380 --> 10:03:07,240
Yeah, with my three ping, guys.

12082
10:03:07,380 --> 10:03:09,140
With my three ping.

12083
10:03:10,080 --> 10:03:12,240
I'mma go with my three ping.

12084
10:03:18,960 --> 10:03:19,880
Oh my god.

12085
10:03:21,300 --> 10:03:22,920
It's fine, we're so healthy.

12086
10:03:24,360 --> 10:03:25,420
We're so healthy.

12087
10:03:26,260 --> 10:03:27,260
The ping did it.

12088
10:03:30,040 --> 10:03:31,740
Alright, we mentos all first if needed.

12089
10:03:36,620 --> 10:03:40,840
To be fair, it looks smooth.

12090
10:03:41,000 --> 10:03:43,600
You guys forgot what it was like to play with NA ping, guys.

12091
10:03:43,700 --> 10:03:44,640
You actually forgot.

12092
10:03:44,640 --> 10:03:49,640
I think you guys actually Stockholm Syndrome'd you.

12093
10:03:49,840 --> 10:03:52,620
You guys legitimately forgot what it was like to be on NA.

12094
10:03:52,700 --> 10:03:54,600
We have not been on NA ping in a while.

12095
10:04:13,800 --> 10:04:15,060
You're so healthy.

12096
10:04:16,880 --> 10:04:18,700
We have a Sora on us.

12097
10:04:20,940 --> 10:04:22,020
Where's Sora on point?

12098
10:04:22,120 --> 10:04:22,680
Where's Sora on point?

12099
10:04:24,920 --> 10:04:26,380
Where is he?

12100
10:04:30,360 --> 10:04:31,920
Another one, another one.

12101
10:04:33,660 --> 10:04:34,540
You're so healthy.

12102
10:04:35,280 --> 10:04:36,550
Change, change, change.

12103
10:04:37,640 --> 10:04:37,820
Huh?

12104
10:04:41,480 --> 10:04:42,520
I'm just like...

12105
10:04:43,360 --> 10:04:43,700
Huh?

12106
10:04:43,980 --> 10:04:45,020
What are you doing?

12107
10:04:46,560 --> 10:04:52,020
I'm just looking at him and then we look at each other.

12108
10:04:54,020 --> 10:04:56,200
Bro, just keep up.

12109
10:04:57,200 --> 10:04:57,980
Bro, just watch.

12110
10:05:05,300 --> 10:05:06,900
They're gonna touch, they're gonna touch.

12111
10:05:10,760 --> 10:05:11,800
Change half.

12112
10:05:15,020 --> 10:05:16,360
Sorlo, Sorlo.

12113
10:05:19,060 --> 10:05:21,540
Nice, we got it.

12114
10:05:21,660 --> 10:05:22,900
Goodbye, everybody.

12115
10:05:23,580 --> 10:05:24,000
Goodbye.

12116
10:05:31,500 --> 10:05:33,220
Die for it.

12117
10:05:33,380 --> 10:05:34,760
Die for the team.

12118
10:05:35,740 --> 10:05:38,020
Die for your Raycrofts.

12119
10:05:41,820 --> 10:05:43,400
Good sacrifice.

12120
10:05:43,400 --> 10:05:43,980
Goodbye.

12121
10:05:50,960 --> 10:05:54,380
You see, you see?

12122
10:05:55,180 --> 10:05:56,940
Okay, we might have lied about the top 500.

12123
10:05:57,580 --> 10:05:58,140
Wait, really?

12124
10:05:58,440 --> 10:05:59,020
What the fuck?

12125
10:06:04,000 --> 10:06:05,580
See, guys?

12126
10:06:06,360 --> 10:06:07,480
Red means good.

12127
10:06:07,740 --> 10:06:08,880
I knew it.

12128
10:06:09,000 --> 10:06:10,520
I knew it, guys.

12129
10:06:11,080 --> 10:06:13,880
Red means super fast.

12130
10:06:16,760 --> 10:06:19,280
I told you.

12131
10:06:19,900 --> 10:06:23,580
Okay, I feed the dodge.

12132
10:06:24,040 --> 10:06:25,120
I'll be right back, guys.

12133
10:06:48,730 --> 10:06:49,210
Okay.

12134
10:06:51,150 --> 10:06:54,450
They have two Wolverine players, by the way.

12135
10:06:54,970 --> 10:06:58,490
We banned their Warrior and I think we leave Hela open.

12136
10:06:59,570 --> 10:07:00,170
Yeah, I'm down.

12137
10:07:01,590 --> 10:07:02,550
I can play Hela, though.

12138
10:07:03,770 --> 10:07:04,370
Can you play Hela?

12139
10:07:04,930 --> 10:07:05,550
Yeah, yeah.

12140
10:07:05,870 --> 10:07:06,270
Okay, good.

12141
10:07:09,250 --> 10:07:10,030
I'm back.

12142
10:07:10,290 --> 10:07:11,470
I fed the doge.

12143
10:07:11,470 --> 10:07:14,490
I fed Doki Amur Doge.

12144
10:07:14,810 --> 10:07:17,270
He's like, he's just like, feed me!

12145
10:07:17,570 --> 10:07:18,170
Feed me!

12146
10:07:18,370 --> 10:07:19,550
And I'm like, okay.

12147
10:07:20,350 --> 10:07:21,710
I feed you.

12148
10:07:23,850 --> 10:07:27,870
He is sustained for another... Paging Doki Burn.

12149
10:07:28,690 --> 10:07:30,130
Feed me, human.

12150
10:07:32,390 --> 10:07:33,630
He's like a little pager.

12151
10:07:33,830 --> 10:07:38,830
He reminds me if he needs... He actually reminds me if his water bowl is empty, too.

12152
10:07:40,570 --> 10:07:42,950
It would be like... Oh my god, is it?

12153
10:07:43,470 --> 10:07:46,730
Oh god, no, it's still... It's still three ping, guys.

12154
10:07:48,810 --> 10:07:51,970
He actually reminds me if he needs water as well, which is nice.

12155
10:07:53,830 --> 10:07:54,790
He's my little pager.

12156
10:08:00,010 --> 10:08:00,910
Like, mother.

12157
10:08:02,330 --> 10:08:03,170
My water.

12158
10:08:03,170 --> 10:08:04,170
I'm not judging.

12159
10:08:05,010 --> 10:08:08,710
Dude, Hela and Hawkeye are a powerful weapon against evil.

12160
10:08:09,130 --> 10:08:10,490
Okay, I was gonna say.

12161
10:08:10,790 --> 10:08:12,810
I'm perfect on both of them, to be honest.

12162
10:08:12,830 --> 10:08:14,270
Go Hela, go Hela.

12163
10:08:14,450 --> 10:08:17,150
He literally... He like, barks at me and is like... Water!

12164
10:08:17,990 --> 10:08:18,430
Water!

12165
10:08:19,110 --> 10:08:20,430
Hawkeye and Hela in one team.

12166
10:08:20,510 --> 10:08:21,450
Let's fucking go.

12167
10:08:31,380 --> 10:08:33,040
Alright, I'm so locked in.

12168
10:08:34,660 --> 10:08:36,720
Locked in round... Fuck, I'm slurring.

12169
10:08:36,720 --> 10:08:41,040
I am locked in round two.

12170
10:08:42,680 --> 10:08:44,940
What is... What did we ban?

12171
10:08:46,140 --> 10:08:48,400
What the fuck is our ban?

12172
10:08:48,940 --> 10:08:50,860
We have Hawkeye and Hela?

12173
10:08:51,660 --> 10:08:56,740
What the fuck?

12174
10:08:56,820 --> 10:08:57,720
I never read this.

12175
10:09:02,340 --> 10:09:05,820
What did we... Why do we have Hawkeye and Hela?

12176
10:09:08,520 --> 10:09:09,780
That's crazy.

12177
10:09:10,160 --> 10:09:13,020
I can't believe we have both Hawkeye and Hela unbanned.

12178
10:09:16,820 --> 10:09:20,160
I hope to God we have the better Hawkeye-Hela player.

12179
10:09:20,840 --> 10:09:22,800
I hope to fucking God.

12180
10:09:24,080 --> 10:09:28,180
I hope to God that...

12181
10:09:28,180 --> 10:09:29,380
Jesus Christ.

12182
10:09:33,000 --> 10:09:34,900
I hope to God.

12183
10:09:36,080 --> 10:09:39,460
Oh my God, we might actually have the better... Oh my God.

12184
10:09:40,460 --> 10:09:42,920
We... We have the better Hawkeye player.

12185
10:09:43,060 --> 10:09:44,380
Let's fucking go!

12186
10:09:51,480 --> 10:09:55,060
We actually have... Oh my God, and he has a thorn blade.

12187
10:09:55,760 --> 10:09:57,820
Oh, the map changed.

12188
10:10:05,520 --> 10:10:08,380
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah.

12189
10:10:08,920 --> 10:10:12,160
Woah, I don't feel so good being over there.

12190
10:10:12,940 --> 10:10:13,540
Woah.

12191
10:10:15,200 --> 10:10:15,800
Woah.

12192
10:10:18,420 --> 10:10:19,020
Woah.

12193
10:10:20,560 --> 10:10:22,380
I'm doing so much damage.

12194
10:10:22,940 --> 10:10:23,240
Woah.

12195
10:10:25,460 --> 10:10:26,060
Woah.

12196
10:10:26,400 --> 10:10:27,420
Peek me, peek me, peek me, peek me.

12197
10:10:28,440 --> 10:10:29,820
Look at point, look at point, look at point.

12198
10:10:31,760 --> 10:10:33,780
I slept... I slept Thor.

12199
10:10:35,200 --> 10:10:36,300
Look at Thor, look at Thor.

12200
10:10:36,520 --> 10:10:38,140
Thor is so low, Thor is so low.

12201
10:10:41,600 --> 10:10:43,480
That's right, go do your thing!

12202
10:10:45,960 --> 10:10:49,060
Oh my God, this is it!

12203
10:10:50,500 --> 10:10:51,680
Hawkeye, dip him!

12204
10:10:54,180 --> 10:10:55,540
Do your thing!

12205
10:10:58,200 --> 10:10:58,640
What?

12206
10:10:59,780 --> 10:11:01,340
Oh, I can't... We can't help you there.

12207
10:11:01,520 --> 10:11:01,960
We got you.

12208
10:11:04,980 --> 10:11:05,560
He's low.

12209
10:11:05,880 --> 10:11:06,700
I have ult soon.

12210
10:11:08,600 --> 10:11:09,480
I will heal you.

12211
10:11:14,200 --> 10:11:14,680
I'm fine.

12212
10:11:15,180 --> 10:11:15,900
I slept him.

12213
10:11:17,000 --> 10:11:18,540
Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom.

12214
10:11:19,360 --> 10:11:20,400
Oh my God.

12215
10:11:22,700 --> 10:11:23,640
Look at Thor, look at Thor, look at Thor.

12216
10:11:24,040 --> 10:11:25,580
I'm on Thor, I'm ulting him.

12217
10:11:26,900 --> 10:11:28,100
Oh, okay, cool.

12218
10:11:29,240 --> 10:11:31,120
I'm on Venom, I'm on Venom.

12219
10:11:33,000 --> 10:11:34,460
I'm on Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor half.

12220
10:11:34,680 --> 10:11:35,060
Thor one.

12221
10:11:36,520 --> 10:11:38,540
There's a Hela behind us, there's a Hela behind us.

12222
10:11:38,680 --> 10:11:39,020
We need help.

12223
10:11:41,620 --> 10:11:43,460
I'll restore three times.

12224
10:11:46,300 --> 10:11:46,800
I'm dead.

12225
10:11:47,100 --> 10:11:47,560
What happened?

12226
10:11:48,020 --> 10:11:48,340
That's fine.

12227
10:11:49,860 --> 10:11:50,480
What happened?

12228
10:11:52,940 --> 10:11:54,020
Node Hela, node Mantis.

12229
10:11:55,500 --> 10:11:57,040
Thor, they've Thor ulted too.

12230
10:11:58,300 --> 10:11:59,900
Bro, I have life, do I have health?

12231
10:11:59,900 --> 10:12:00,700
Let me help.

12232
10:12:02,040 --> 10:12:05,140
Alright, it's my bad.

12233
10:12:05,360 --> 10:12:06,000
I need assistance.

12234
10:12:08,860 --> 10:12:09,660
Hela's one.

12235
10:12:09,860 --> 10:12:10,600
Oh, fuck, she's one.

12236
10:12:10,820 --> 10:12:13,620
Yes, she is.

12237
10:12:16,640 --> 10:12:18,080
There's a Venom behind me.

12238
10:12:18,780 --> 10:12:19,220
Venom.

12239
10:12:21,380 --> 10:12:22,220
I'm on Venom.

12240
10:12:22,320 --> 10:12:23,220
Venom's so low.

12241
10:12:24,040 --> 10:12:25,180
He's one, he's one, he's one.

12242
10:12:26,520 --> 10:12:27,780
Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor.

12243
10:12:27,780 --> 10:12:31,340
Don't die to Hela, do not die to this character.

12244
10:12:31,420 --> 10:12:32,740
I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die to her.

12245
10:12:33,760 --> 10:12:34,540
Don't fucking die to Hela.

12246
10:12:34,540 --> 10:12:35,300
I'm gonna do it.

12247
10:12:36,480 --> 10:12:37,060
Please don't.

12248
10:12:38,940 --> 10:12:40,820
Please kill her, she's one.

12249
10:12:46,180 --> 10:12:47,600
She was literally one.

12250
10:12:47,780 --> 10:12:49,940
This might be our fifth game in a row that we win.

12251
10:12:51,540 --> 10:12:53,420
Oh wait, I did not smite him, he's one.

12252
10:12:54,460 --> 10:12:55,440
Thor, Thor, Thor has.

12253
10:12:58,760 --> 10:13:00,520
Are you guys, like, stuck?

12254
10:13:00,900 --> 10:13:02,720
No, bro, I wouldn't play with these losers.

12255
10:13:02,940 --> 10:13:03,260
Yeah, no.

12256
10:13:04,580 --> 10:13:05,940
I agree with you.

12257
10:13:05,980 --> 10:13:06,800
Oh my god.

12258
10:13:08,400 --> 10:13:10,080
Yeah, I just meant that.

12259
10:13:10,200 --> 10:13:11,960
I don't know, we just keep it in each other.

12260
10:13:14,340 --> 10:13:16,420
You don't disrespect the Dragoon, man.

12261
10:13:25,700 --> 10:13:26,100
Dragoonation.

12262
10:13:26,100 --> 10:13:28,540
Okay, so...

12263
10:13:28,540 --> 10:13:29,940
Who is up for due after this?

12264
10:13:30,420 --> 10:13:31,520
Nobody, bro, get out.

12265
10:13:35,380 --> 10:13:39,580
Wait, wait, what's your rank?

12266
10:13:41,040 --> 10:13:42,740
What do you mean, what's my rank?

12267
10:13:43,160 --> 10:13:43,300
What's your rank?

12268
10:13:43,560 --> 10:13:44,360
Peak check, peak check, peak check.

12269
10:13:44,500 --> 10:13:46,040
Peak check, peak check, what's your peak?

12270
10:13:50,400 --> 10:13:54,100
Bro, fucking 6,000 points, bro, easily.

12271
10:13:54,400 --> 10:13:55,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12272
10:13:55,220 --> 10:13:56,720
You remember how you got 7,000 points?

12273
10:13:57,140 --> 10:14:01,480
The only reason I'm doing well is because I have a job to do.

12274
10:14:01,640 --> 10:14:03,640
Didn't even tell us his peak.

12275
10:14:05,420 --> 10:14:08,960
Wait, there's someone to my left.

12276
10:14:16,320 --> 10:14:18,960
There's so many things going on.

12277
10:14:20,840 --> 10:14:21,820
Let's peak together.

12278
10:14:25,600 --> 10:14:27,200
What am I getting hit by?

12279
10:14:27,820 --> 10:14:29,180
Oh my god!

12280
10:14:29,700 --> 10:14:30,360
Good luck.

12281
10:14:30,660 --> 10:14:31,500
Good luck, everybody.

12282
10:14:32,780 --> 10:14:34,160
Is this winnable or no?

12283
10:14:34,220 --> 10:14:34,860
Because I can ult.

12284
10:14:37,800 --> 10:14:39,020
Yeah, okay, I'll ult this.

12285
10:14:39,940 --> 10:14:40,640
Let's do this.

12286
10:14:43,640 --> 10:14:45,920
Oh, they ulted too.

12287
10:14:51,220 --> 10:14:52,220
Click one, click one!

12288
10:14:55,220 --> 10:14:56,240
Oh, I got you, I got you.

12289
10:14:58,660 --> 10:15:00,840
I don't have heals, I don't have heals for Loki.

12290
10:15:02,220 --> 10:15:04,000
Strange, strange, strange, we can't focus on him.

12291
10:15:07,020 --> 10:15:07,920
So funny, bro.

12292
10:15:17,040 --> 10:15:19,240
I just made one joke, bro.

12293
10:15:19,720 --> 10:15:21,320
I made one joke.

12294
10:15:23,920 --> 10:15:25,360
What the hell?

12295
10:15:25,460 --> 10:15:25,780
What the hell?

12296
10:15:25,920 --> 10:15:26,820
Oh, sorry.

12297
10:15:34,120 --> 10:15:36,820
Jesus, oh, you are so fucking low.

12298
10:15:39,500 --> 10:15:40,700
Okay, okay.

12299
10:15:41,420 --> 10:15:43,120
I got you, I boosted and healed you.

12300
10:15:45,680 --> 10:15:46,280
Goodbye.

12301
10:15:53,120 --> 10:15:54,400
Just chill, chill, chill.

12302
10:15:54,580 --> 10:15:55,360
Yeah, yeah, we're dead.

12303
10:15:57,140 --> 10:15:58,860
I think I might get a random ass kill.

12304
10:15:59,520 --> 10:16:00,340
I believe in him.

12305
10:16:01,460 --> 10:16:02,340
I damage boosted him.

12306
10:16:06,140 --> 10:16:07,340
That scared me.

12307
10:16:08,520 --> 10:16:09,540
I damage boosted you again.

12308
10:16:13,060 --> 10:16:13,480
Okay,

12309
10:16:19,360 --> 10:16:20,060
they have double tank now.

12310
10:16:21,320 --> 10:16:22,520
I got you, bro.

12311
10:16:22,700 --> 10:16:25,020
That was such a good time, bro.

12312
10:16:25,560 --> 10:16:26,620
You should have Psylocke on here.

12313
10:16:27,060 --> 10:16:29,720
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

12314
10:16:30,080 --> 10:16:30,680
Nice block.

12315
10:16:31,660 --> 10:16:32,000
Fear.

12316
10:16:32,160 --> 10:16:32,860
Nice, Psylocke.

12317
10:16:36,040 --> 10:16:37,360
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

12318
10:16:38,820 --> 10:16:39,900
I'm looking at Magneto.

12319
10:16:40,240 --> 10:16:41,000
Magneto's half.

12320
10:16:41,940 --> 10:16:43,820
The strange is pushing our Pella.

12321
10:16:44,460 --> 10:16:44,900
I can't.

12322
10:16:45,960 --> 10:16:47,060
He's half, by the way.

12323
10:16:47,300 --> 10:16:49,060
There's a... close to sleep, close to sleep.

12324
10:16:51,480 --> 10:16:52,620
We're up too, we're up.

12325
10:16:53,720 --> 10:16:54,620
Magneto, Magneto.

12326
10:16:55,140 --> 10:16:55,780
Focus Magneto.

12327
10:17:03,020 --> 10:17:03,980
I have...

12328
10:17:05,100 --> 10:17:07,460
They have strange ult, right?

12329
10:17:08,060 --> 10:17:10,780
And Psylocke too.

12330
10:17:10,820 --> 10:17:11,820
Oh my god, she had a lot.

12331
10:17:17,200 --> 10:17:20,980
That would be so silly.

12332
10:17:20,980 --> 10:17:21,040
Really?

12333
10:17:22,140 --> 10:17:23,060
I'll ult first.

12334
10:17:24,740 --> 10:17:25,720
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

12335
10:17:25,800 --> 10:17:26,520
Oh, I can't see you.

12336
10:17:26,680 --> 10:17:27,600
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

12337
10:17:27,820 --> 10:17:28,980
I got you, I got you.

12338
10:17:34,300 --> 10:17:35,240
Pella's low, Pella's one.

12339
10:17:40,280 --> 10:17:40,600
Nice.

12340
10:17:44,660 --> 10:17:46,640
Whoa, Pella to your left.

12341
10:17:52,800 --> 10:17:54,700
They only used hella ult for that.

12342
10:17:55,920 --> 10:17:56,860
I'm pushing up, bro.

12343
10:17:57,180 --> 10:17:57,660
They might TP.

12344
10:17:58,400 --> 10:17:59,520
I might cancel it.

12345
10:17:59,720 --> 10:18:00,260
I'm going to spawn.

12346
10:18:01,800 --> 10:18:02,240
Alright.

12347
10:18:04,460 --> 10:18:05,140
He's opening portal.

12348
10:18:05,580 --> 10:18:06,400
I canceled it.

12349
10:18:06,740 --> 10:18:07,340
Oh, nice.

12350
10:18:07,340 --> 10:18:08,040
I'm so fucking good at this game.

12351
10:18:08,060 --> 10:18:09,880
You're so good at this game.

12352
10:18:10,600 --> 10:18:12,080
They're coming in, though, they're coming in.

12353
10:18:14,700 --> 10:18:15,140
Nice.

12354
10:18:16,000 --> 10:18:16,040
Oh!

12355
10:18:16,040 --> 10:18:16,680
Oh!

12356
10:18:22,720 --> 10:18:26,700
We even got the use of portals.

12357
10:18:26,940 --> 10:18:27,300
Yay!

12358
10:18:31,940 --> 10:18:32,700
Yippee!

12359
10:18:34,880 --> 10:18:35,560
Yippee!

12360
10:18:38,460 --> 10:18:40,600
Let me restart.

12361
10:18:41,440 --> 10:18:42,480
Winning stream.

12362
10:18:43,160 --> 10:18:44,480
Winning the stream.

12363
10:18:46,820 --> 10:18:47,860
This is...

12364
10:18:47,860 --> 10:18:48,900
This is it.

12365
10:18:49,620 --> 10:18:50,840
This is it.

12366
10:18:51,900 --> 10:18:52,540
You know what?

12367
10:18:52,660 --> 10:18:53,080
Maybe...

12368
10:18:53,080 --> 10:18:54,460
No, I shouldn't test it.

12369
10:18:55,860 --> 10:18:56,960
Oh, I got an achievement?

12370
10:18:57,180 --> 10:18:58,220
Because I fucking read?

12371
10:18:59,520 --> 10:19:00,260
I'm going to make...

12372
10:19:00,720 --> 10:19:02,440
I'm going to make Doki bridge fed.

12373
10:19:04,640 --> 10:19:06,700
Leader, because I don't like responsibility.

12374
10:19:07,720 --> 10:19:08,760
How's Mac doing?

12375
10:19:09,480 --> 10:19:11,000
Hey, he's winning back his games, too!

12376
10:19:11,120 --> 10:19:11,460
Nice.

12377
10:19:11,600 --> 10:19:12,100
Me, too.

12378
10:19:12,900 --> 10:19:13,540
Me, too.

12379
10:19:13,920 --> 10:19:14,780
How's Rosa doing?

12380
10:19:16,040 --> 10:19:16,780
Fuck you, Rosa.

12381
10:19:17,420 --> 10:19:20,160
What the fuck?

12382
10:19:20,660 --> 10:19:22,040
Fuck you, Rosa.

12383
10:19:24,680 --> 10:19:27,240
Jesus Christ, Rosa.

12384
10:19:31,020 --> 10:19:33,300
I can't poach him!

12385
10:19:33,580 --> 10:19:35,760
He's actually hacking!

12386
10:19:39,620 --> 10:19:41,580
Oh my god.

12387
10:19:44,160 --> 10:19:46,800
Booger was like, don't invite him.

12388
10:19:47,080 --> 10:19:48,820
We don't know for sure.

12389
10:19:53,380 --> 10:19:55,500
We can't tell.

12390
10:19:55,920 --> 10:20:00,000
Nobody knows if he's legit or not.

12391
10:20:02,420 --> 10:20:04,520
We can't tell.

12392
10:20:08,260 --> 10:20:11,260
We don't want to risk it.

12393
10:20:18,060 --> 10:20:19,540
Don't say anything.

12394
10:20:21,020 --> 10:20:22,000
Oh my god.

12395
10:20:22,080 --> 10:20:23,200
He was so...

12396
10:20:23,200 --> 10:20:26,400
For those who have never seen Rosa...

12397
10:20:28,040 --> 10:20:32,440
He basically got Bucky-aled every fucking fight.

12398
10:20:32,800 --> 10:20:34,720
That was how scary he was.

12399
10:20:35,180 --> 10:20:36,240
And I was going to poach...

12400
10:20:36,240 --> 10:20:38,420
I wasn't going to poach him.

12401
10:20:38,760 --> 10:20:40,540
He was doing it with somebody else.

12402
10:20:40,660 --> 10:20:45,000
And I was like, what if I just steal him right now and add him to my stack?

12403
10:20:47,820 --> 10:20:48,860
And then...

12404
10:20:48,860 --> 10:20:49,420
But then...

12405
10:20:50,060 --> 10:20:52,420
Booger was like, he doesn't know.

12406
10:20:52,500 --> 10:20:54,320
We don't know if he's legit or not.

12407
10:20:54,500 --> 10:20:57,000
Because he's like somebody's smurf account.

12408
10:20:57,280 --> 10:20:59,060
But we're like, we're not that sure.

12409
10:20:59,960 --> 10:21:01,900
We know he's that smurf account.

12410
10:21:02,420 --> 10:21:03,740
He's that guy's smurf account.

12411
10:21:03,860 --> 10:21:05,660
But we aren't sure if he's legit or not.

12412
10:21:05,920 --> 10:21:06,620
I don't know.

12413
10:21:06,680 --> 10:21:09,620
Either way, I don't know the community that legitimately.

12414
10:21:09,860 --> 10:21:13,800
I don't really know people in this Marvel Rivals community.

12415
10:21:14,000 --> 10:21:15,200
So like, I can't tell.

12416
10:21:17,180 --> 10:21:20,480
But he has a 13% crit accuracy on Bucky.

12417
10:21:21,160 --> 10:21:22,700
Which is pretty sus.

12418
10:21:29,240 --> 10:21:32,920
Like, 13% on Bucky alone is really fucking good.

12419
10:21:40,140 --> 10:21:41,140
What rank am I?

12420
10:21:41,800 --> 10:21:42,940
Don't worry about it.

12421
10:21:43,980 --> 10:21:47,160
Let me get to a good ELO first before I tell you my rank.

12422
10:21:58,250 --> 10:22:01,000
Let me get there first.

12423
10:22:14,710 --> 10:22:16,270
The same ban?

12424
10:22:19,010 --> 10:22:20,710
They've all blurred together.

12425
10:22:20,970 --> 10:22:22,610
What does he mean by that?

12426
10:22:24,210 --> 10:22:25,990
They've all blurred together.

12427
10:22:26,130 --> 10:22:27,490
I can't tell anymore.

12428
10:22:27,490 --> 10:22:29,210
I cannot tell.

12429
10:22:31,010 --> 10:22:33,110
It all feels the same.

12430
10:22:44,940 --> 10:22:45,620
Oh no.

12431
10:22:46,440 --> 10:22:47,480
Who are you?

12432
10:22:49,840 --> 10:22:51,140
We just banned Volv again?

12433
10:22:51,300 --> 10:22:51,480
Nice.

12434
10:22:51,620 --> 10:22:52,200
Okay, let's go.

12435
10:22:57,460 --> 10:23:00,280
Do you know how to play Mantis?

12436
10:23:00,900 --> 10:23:01,500
I don't remember.

12437
10:23:02,980 --> 10:23:05,880
I don't think he knows how to play Mantis, guys.

12438
10:23:06,880 --> 10:23:10,020
I don't think he knows.

12439
10:23:11,420 --> 10:23:13,860
I don't think he knows.

12440
10:23:15,640 --> 10:23:18,340
Come on, little guy.

12441
10:23:18,800 --> 10:23:20,060
Meow, meow.

12442
10:23:20,360 --> 10:23:22,020
Come on, little guy.

12443
10:23:23,140 --> 10:23:24,740
Meow, meow.

12444
10:23:25,400 --> 10:23:26,120
Come on!

12445
10:23:27,560 --> 10:23:29,020
Come on!

12446
10:23:31,760 --> 10:23:33,880
Just do one little thing.

12447
10:23:33,940 --> 10:23:34,320
Come on.

12448
10:23:34,320 --> 10:23:35,900
You know you want to.

12449
10:23:35,900 --> 10:23:37,100
Come on.

12450
10:23:37,200 --> 10:23:37,960
Yay!

12451
10:23:42,400 --> 10:23:45,720
Oh my god, he did it.

12452
10:23:46,500 --> 10:23:47,740
Good boy.

12453
10:23:49,140 --> 10:23:51,320
He fucking grew hands.

12454
10:23:51,580 --> 10:23:52,840
I'm so proud of you.

12455
10:23:55,160 --> 10:23:57,760
Oh my god, he fucking grew hands.

12456
10:23:57,880 --> 10:23:58,980
I'm so proud of him.

12457
10:23:59,440 --> 10:24:01,960
I'm so fucking proud of him.

12458
10:24:02,860 --> 10:24:06,600
He fucking found some hands to use.

12459
10:24:08,980 --> 10:24:10,400
She gave up.

12460
10:24:10,560 --> 10:24:11,540
Don't screw this.

12461
10:24:11,960 --> 10:24:14,520
Guys, I'm not a Luna 1 trick.

12462
10:24:15,540 --> 10:24:19,280
I have a higher win rate on Mantis, guys.

12463
10:24:20,000 --> 10:24:22,220
I'm not a Luna 1 trick.

12464
10:24:24,040 --> 10:24:28,320
It's just Luna's a better character because she's the strongest healer.

12465
10:24:28,560 --> 10:24:31,540
And I trust myself on the strongest healer.

12466
10:24:31,960 --> 10:24:32,840
It's different.

12467
10:24:36,080 --> 10:24:43,940
I hope he has the orb.

12468
10:24:45,660 --> 10:24:50,160
Bro, I can't keep healing you.

12469
10:24:50,840 --> 10:24:54,520
I can't.

12470
10:24:54,820 --> 10:24:57,080
Oh my god, kill him!

12471
10:25:01,960 --> 10:25:02,520
What am I doing?

12472
10:25:02,820 --> 10:25:04,060
Look at you!

12473
10:25:08,100 --> 10:25:08,820
Nice.

12474
10:25:08,820 --> 10:25:10,420
He fucking did it.

12475
10:25:14,700 --> 10:25:15,480
Focus one.

12476
10:25:17,460 --> 10:25:18,060
Here we go.

12477
10:25:24,300 --> 10:25:25,020
Nice.

12478
10:25:29,600 --> 10:25:30,360
Wait, there's a Hulk.

12479
10:25:30,740 --> 10:25:31,300
I remember him.

12480
10:25:33,080 --> 10:25:34,540
It pleases me to be helpful.

12481
10:25:35,060 --> 10:25:37,820
I got you, I got you, I got you.

12482
10:25:39,360 --> 10:25:40,480
I froze him.

12483
10:25:41,480 --> 10:25:42,100
Nice, nice.

12484
10:25:46,980 --> 10:25:48,160
Who's my DPS players?

12485
10:25:50,580 --> 10:25:51,800
I can't heal you up there.

12486
10:25:52,840 --> 10:25:53,840
You don't need to heal me.

12487
10:25:53,920 --> 10:25:55,220
Alright, I'll stop healing.

12488
10:25:58,120 --> 10:25:59,480
I got you, I got you, I got you.

12489
10:25:59,480 --> 10:26:00,440
You need to move me.

12490
10:26:00,740 --> 10:26:01,360
You want to move me?

12491
10:26:01,520 --> 10:26:02,000
I...

12492
10:26:03,020 --> 10:26:06,800
I don't have ult yet, so you can Luna ult first if you need to.

12493
10:26:08,920 --> 10:26:10,080
I'm gonna heal up there.

12494
10:26:10,080 --> 10:26:12,400
I can't get to you, booger.

12495
10:26:18,520 --> 10:26:20,500
I just damage boost.

12496
10:26:21,700 --> 10:26:24,140
I just... I'm a damage booster.

12497
10:26:24,400 --> 10:26:25,440
I just...

12498
10:26:25,440 --> 10:26:27,280
All I do is press E.

12499
10:26:28,460 --> 10:26:31,060
All I do is press E.

12500
10:26:31,160 --> 10:26:33,520
Okay, I don't have Mantis ult.

12501
10:26:35,420 --> 10:26:36,020
Nice.

12502
10:26:43,940 --> 10:26:46,580
All I do is press E.

12503
10:26:46,660 --> 10:26:48,780
I don't even shoot my hands.

12504
10:26:50,420 --> 10:26:52,160
All I do is E.

12505
10:26:52,360 --> 10:26:55,120
Like, they just die before I can shoot my hands.

12506
10:27:01,280 --> 10:27:02,320
Oh my gosh.

12507
10:27:07,460 --> 10:27:07,900
Okay.

12508
10:27:09,420 --> 10:27:10,560
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

12509
10:27:10,680 --> 10:27:11,140
Stay near me.

12510
10:27:14,680 --> 10:27:15,560
Holy shit.

12511
10:27:17,720 --> 10:27:19,260
I am damage boosting you.

12512
10:27:20,820 --> 10:27:21,340
I got this, bro.

12513
10:27:24,400 --> 10:27:25,060
Oh, I don't got this.

12514
10:27:25,500 --> 10:27:27,080
You are so yo.

12515
10:27:27,080 --> 10:27:27,660
I got this.

12516
10:27:30,160 --> 10:27:33,760
Oh, there's a Hawkeye on the left.

12517
10:27:37,220 --> 10:27:38,500
Watch out.

12518
10:27:41,900 --> 10:27:43,080
I'm on Magneto.

12519
10:27:43,900 --> 10:27:45,480
Magneto's on point, Chris.

12520
10:27:47,660 --> 10:27:49,280
Can we help on Magneto?

12521
10:27:51,760 --> 10:27:52,760
Oh, fear.

12522
10:28:02,270 --> 10:28:03,450
Oh my god.

12523
10:28:05,410 --> 10:28:06,970
We're down one.

12524
10:28:07,090 --> 10:28:08,170
Okay, we're down two.

12525
10:28:10,130 --> 10:28:11,810
Rest in peace.

12526
10:28:14,350 --> 10:28:15,190
Nice.

12527
10:28:16,210 --> 10:28:17,350
I'm healing you.

12528
10:28:21,390 --> 10:28:22,970
Oh my god.

12529
10:28:29,390 --> 10:28:30,610
I grab him.

12530
10:28:30,630 --> 10:28:31,390
Did you get him?

12531
10:28:35,250 --> 10:28:37,010
There's a Starlord to our left.

12532
10:28:38,270 --> 10:28:39,170
He's behind us.

12533
10:28:42,110 --> 10:28:43,170
I'm on Starlord.

12534
10:28:43,230 --> 10:28:43,610
Starlord one.

12535
10:28:43,790 --> 10:28:44,050
Starlord one.

12536
10:28:44,370 --> 10:28:44,870
Pushing up.

12537
10:28:44,950 --> 10:28:45,510
Pushing up with this.

12538
10:28:46,170 --> 10:28:46,630
Push up.

12539
10:28:46,630 --> 10:28:47,130
Push up with this.

12540
10:28:47,630 --> 10:28:48,310
Get the Magneto.

12541
10:28:48,370 --> 10:28:48,770
Get the Magneto.

12542
10:28:49,170 --> 10:28:49,710
He's half.

12543
10:28:49,770 --> 10:28:49,970
He's half.

12544
10:28:50,050 --> 10:28:50,250
He's half.

12545
10:28:53,770 --> 10:28:54,710
I got you.

12546
10:28:55,250 --> 10:28:56,070
I'm close to ult.

12547
10:28:59,030 --> 10:28:59,730
I'm ulting.

12548
10:28:59,830 --> 10:29:00,170
I'm ulting this.

12549
10:29:02,810 --> 10:29:04,010
I cannot see.

12550
10:29:04,110 --> 10:29:04,830
I cannot see.

12551
10:29:07,390 --> 10:29:08,550
I'm backing up.

12552
10:29:10,830 --> 10:29:11,050
Nice.

12553
10:29:11,350 --> 10:29:11,350
Nice.

12554
10:29:13,070 --> 10:29:14,050
Oh, legend time.

12555
10:29:17,850 --> 10:29:18,890
There is...

12556
10:29:18,890 --> 10:29:19,090
Cloak.

12557
10:29:19,090 --> 10:29:19,310
Cloak.

12558
10:29:19,370 --> 10:29:20,190
Cloak and Magneto.

12559
10:29:20,270 --> 10:29:20,810
Cloak and Magneto.

12560
10:29:21,230 --> 10:29:22,050
I slept Magneto.

12561
10:29:22,590 --> 10:29:23,530
Luna is on her ult.

12562
10:29:23,910 --> 10:29:27,630
I think we got to regroup.

12563
10:29:27,790 --> 10:29:28,310
We got to regroup.

12564
10:29:28,830 --> 10:29:29,650
They Luna ulted.

12565
10:29:29,750 --> 10:29:30,350
They Luna ulted.

12566
10:29:32,770 --> 10:29:34,450
I don't know you live this bug.

12567
10:29:34,530 --> 10:29:35,090
Oh, you do.

12568
10:29:44,750 --> 10:29:45,830
You're so alive.

12569
10:29:45,910 --> 10:29:46,510
You're so alive.

12570
10:29:47,290 --> 10:29:48,090
You're so healthy.

12571
10:29:48,170 --> 10:29:48,590
You're so healthy.

12572
10:29:48,670 --> 10:29:48,950
You're so healthy.

12573
10:29:49,030 --> 10:29:49,790
I'm damage boosting you.

12574
10:29:52,890 --> 10:29:54,390
One spit away from dying here.

12575
10:29:54,470 --> 10:29:55,090
I'm going to chase him.

12576
10:29:56,350 --> 10:29:57,030
We got to pick.

12577
10:29:57,150 --> 10:29:57,490
We got to pick.

12578
10:29:57,550 --> 10:29:57,910
We got to pick.

12579
10:30:03,550 --> 10:30:04,230
I got you.

12580
10:30:04,270 --> 10:30:04,610
I got you.

12581
10:30:06,870 --> 10:30:07,730
I don't have heals.

12582
10:30:07,830 --> 10:30:08,530
I don't have heals.

12583
10:30:09,830 --> 10:30:10,390
I slept...

12584
10:30:10,390 --> 10:30:11,190
Oh, I picked nevermind.

12585
10:30:14,910 --> 10:30:15,590
I see you.

12586
10:30:15,670 --> 10:30:15,930
I see you.

12587
10:30:15,950 --> 10:30:16,170
I see you.

12588
10:30:16,230 --> 10:30:16,370
Push.

12589
10:30:16,370 --> 10:30:16,630
Push.

12590
10:30:16,630 --> 10:30:16,830
Push.

12591
10:30:16,850 --> 10:30:16,850
Push.

12592
10:30:17,510 --> 10:30:18,150
I'm on my heal.

12593
10:30:22,190 --> 10:30:23,230
I'm on Magneto.

12594
10:30:23,330 --> 10:30:23,850
I'm on Magneto.

12595
10:30:25,290 --> 10:30:25,930
Magneto.

12596
10:30:25,990 --> 10:30:26,310
Magneto.

12597
10:30:26,430 --> 10:30:26,570
Please.

12598
10:30:29,130 --> 10:30:31,050
I damage boost you.

12599
10:30:33,010 --> 10:30:33,650
Psylocke.

12600
10:30:33,930 --> 10:30:34,110
Psylocke.

12601
10:30:35,550 --> 10:30:41,950
Oh my god.

12602
10:30:42,010 --> 10:30:44,950
That was an insane heal.

12603
10:30:45,010 --> 10:30:47,090
We haven't lost once with Ironman health.

12604
10:30:47,470 --> 10:30:48,110
Yeah.

12605
10:30:48,410 --> 10:30:51,090
Yeah, we haven't lost once.

12606
10:30:52,070 --> 10:30:54,410
I haven't seen the screen in so long.

12607
10:30:54,890 --> 10:30:57,010
I actually forget how it looks like.

12608
10:30:59,820 --> 10:31:00,130
Sure.

12609
10:31:00,970 --> 10:31:03,650
Not bad for a Luna main.

12610
10:31:04,450 --> 10:31:05,110
No, I swear.

12611
10:31:05,310 --> 10:31:06,930
I haven't... I swear.

12612
10:31:07,230 --> 10:31:08,610
They die so fast.

12613
10:31:08,670 --> 10:31:10,470
I don't get to shoot my hands.

12614
10:31:11,030 --> 10:31:13,610
I literally just E everybody.

12615
10:31:13,930 --> 10:31:16,550
And please let me shoot my hands.

12616
10:31:18,190 --> 10:31:19,590
It won't let me.

12617
10:31:19,650 --> 10:31:21,150
It won't let me shoot.

12618
10:31:22,050 --> 10:31:23,050
I just go E.

12619
10:31:24,210 --> 10:31:25,930
That's all I did.

12620
10:31:26,590 --> 10:31:28,370
Everybody was so far away.

12621
10:31:30,090 --> 10:31:32,190
Let me shoot my hands.

12622
10:31:34,950 --> 10:31:40,350
Guys, my accuracy is low because I literally can't fucking shoot anybody.

12623
10:31:40,850 --> 10:31:42,630
I just let... I just go E.

12624
10:31:45,790 --> 10:31:49,130
Guys, I can't have such a low accuracy.

12625
10:31:49,130 --> 10:31:50,050
Guys, please.

12626
10:31:50,170 --> 10:31:50,910
Please.

12627
10:31:51,070 --> 10:31:53,010
I'm supposed to be one of the players.

12628
10:31:58,270 --> 10:31:59,110
Look.

12629
10:31:59,110 --> 10:31:59,950
E.

12630
10:32:01,230 --> 10:32:02,070
E.

12631
10:32:04,650 --> 10:32:06,550
This is my whole job.

12632
10:32:07,390 --> 10:32:08,110
Nice.

12633
10:32:08,450 --> 10:32:08,930
E.

12634
10:32:12,850 --> 10:32:15,410
This is all I do.

12635
10:32:16,030 --> 10:32:16,270
E.

12636
10:32:19,770 --> 10:32:21,010
E.

12637
10:32:23,790 --> 10:32:25,030
Oh.

12638
10:32:27,770 --> 10:32:30,250
That's unlucky.

12639
10:32:31,030 --> 10:32:32,590
That's unlucky.

12640
10:32:33,610 --> 10:32:34,730
That's very unlucky.

12641
10:32:35,090 --> 10:32:38,630
I... I did everything I could.

12642
10:32:39,710 --> 10:32:42,790
I can't get to you.

12643
10:32:52,220 --> 10:32:52,440
Oh.

12644
10:32:54,400 --> 10:32:54,880
E.

12645
10:32:58,040 --> 10:32:58,860
Fuckers have...

12646
10:32:58,860 --> 10:32:59,260
Oh, fuck.

12647
10:32:59,920 --> 10:33:00,400
Oh.

12648
10:33:05,000 --> 10:33:06,040
Coordination is dead.

12649
10:33:11,020 --> 10:33:11,840
Nice kill, though.

12650
10:33:11,860 --> 10:33:12,180
Nice kill.

12651
10:33:12,700 --> 10:33:13,480
We can play for support.

12652
10:33:13,600 --> 10:33:14,420
Maybe we can get him.

12653
10:33:14,780 --> 10:33:15,360
Oh, my God.

12654
10:33:15,420 --> 10:33:16,900
I might be fucking dead.

12655
10:33:18,240 --> 10:33:18,820
No, don't keep...

12656
10:33:18,820 --> 10:33:19,820
You're not dead.

12657
10:33:20,240 --> 10:33:20,900
You click.

12658
10:33:21,660 --> 10:33:22,640
I'm so dead.

12659
10:33:22,640 --> 10:33:25,000
I can... I... I try to...

12660
10:33:27,820 --> 10:33:29,840
I'm, like, not okay here.

12661
10:33:29,940 --> 10:33:30,460
Go.

12662
10:33:30,500 --> 10:33:30,880
Get him.

12663
10:33:30,980 --> 10:33:31,200
Get him.

12664
10:33:31,460 --> 10:33:32,360
I'm okay now.

12665
10:33:33,280 --> 10:33:34,900
I'll... I'll mess this up first if needed.

12666
10:33:37,440 --> 10:33:38,600
Booger, are you okay?

12667
10:33:38,720 --> 10:33:39,040
Oh.

12668
10:33:40,600 --> 10:33:43,080
Listen, no heal, no DPS, no tanks, no nothing.

12669
10:33:44,560 --> 10:33:45,440
Backing out.

12670
10:33:45,580 --> 10:33:46,800
I'm backing out.

12671
10:33:47,360 --> 10:33:48,400
Oh, fuck.

12672
10:33:48,400 --> 10:33:52,740
I can mag this shit.

12673
10:33:54,680 --> 10:33:55,200
Oh.

12674
10:33:56,860 --> 10:33:57,380
Oh.

12675
10:33:58,360 --> 10:33:59,120
Oh, fucker.

12676
10:33:59,480 --> 10:34:01,340
We gotta... we gotta regroup here.

12677
10:34:01,900 --> 10:34:02,560
I'll dial...

12678
10:34:02,560 --> 10:34:06,060
Oh, just stay near me for the extra heals.

12679
10:34:15,360 --> 10:34:18,960
Oh, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear!

12680
10:34:18,960 --> 10:34:23,500
How did he fucking walk through all of us?!

12681
10:34:24,820 --> 10:34:25,960
What the fuck?!

12682
10:34:42,740 --> 10:34:44,580
Oh, I'm trying to get to you right now.

12683
10:34:45,580 --> 10:34:46,600
I got you, I got you.

12684
10:34:47,900 --> 10:34:48,580
He's one, he's one.

12685
10:34:48,720 --> 10:34:49,360
I'm one, I'm one.

12686
10:34:50,120 --> 10:34:51,560
Can we even contest this?

12687
10:34:51,860 --> 10:34:53,600
I think we should be able to contest this.

12688
10:34:53,780 --> 10:34:54,440
Okay, okay.

12689
10:35:00,020 --> 10:35:00,920
Oh my god.

12690
10:35:01,080 --> 10:35:01,580
It's fine, it's fine.

12691
10:35:05,040 --> 10:35:05,980
I see you, I see you.

12692
10:35:06,080 --> 10:35:06,580
Nice pick, nice pick.

12693
10:35:06,680 --> 10:35:07,500
We should be able to...

12694
10:35:10,100 --> 10:35:11,620
I'm fucking blocked, I'm fucking blocked!

12695
10:35:12,980 --> 10:35:13,760
Oh my god.

12696
10:35:15,540 --> 10:35:18,180
I believe, I believe.

12697
10:35:22,460 --> 10:35:23,980
Oh my god.

12698
10:35:24,260 --> 10:35:26,000
He's so low, the Magneto's so low!

12699
10:35:29,560 --> 10:35:31,260
The Magneto's low.

12700
10:35:33,460 --> 10:35:35,520
I don't have heals.

12701
10:35:37,140 --> 10:35:37,400
No!

12702
10:35:37,660 --> 10:35:38,420
I'm okay!

12703
10:35:43,760 --> 10:35:44,820
I'm damage boosting you.

12704
10:35:47,160 --> 10:35:48,520
You're damage boosting, you're damage boosting.

12705
10:35:50,040 --> 10:35:51,820
I need, I'm so close to an ult.

12706
10:35:52,600 --> 10:35:53,080
Nice, nice, nice.

12707
10:35:58,520 --> 10:35:59,760
There's a Hawkeye to our left.

12708
10:36:05,300 --> 10:36:07,000
Who did he copy, who did he copy?

12709
10:36:09,620 --> 10:36:14,960
I'm ulting, I'm ulting this.

12710
10:36:21,770 --> 10:36:23,320
I slept somebody.

12711
10:36:26,580 --> 10:36:28,610
Yeah, he's dead, he's dead.

12712
10:36:28,750 --> 10:36:29,370
He's coming now though.

12713
10:36:29,690 --> 10:36:31,290
Oh my god.

12714
10:36:31,690 --> 10:36:32,670
If I don't die.

12715
10:36:36,590 --> 10:36:38,290
Oh, I live.

12716
10:36:39,190 --> 10:36:39,970
Run!

12717
10:36:42,410 --> 10:36:43,190
Run!

12718
10:36:45,110 --> 10:36:45,630
Run!

12719
10:36:50,010 --> 10:36:53,230
Jesus Christ, I hate, I hate my three ping.

12720
10:36:57,750 --> 10:36:58,950
Three minutes?

12721
10:36:59,810 --> 10:37:04,390
We have to defend this for three minutes?

12722
10:37:10,100 --> 10:37:11,360
That Magneto's so low.

12723
10:37:16,640 --> 10:37:17,080
Nice.

12724
10:37:17,080 --> 10:37:17,740
Massive, massive.

12725
10:37:20,720 --> 10:37:22,440
He never missed, guys.

12726
10:37:24,740 --> 10:37:26,500
He never missed, guys.

12727
10:37:28,840 --> 10:37:32,100
Oh my, you were so... yeah.

12728
10:37:36,200 --> 10:37:37,620
I'm backing up.

12729
10:37:42,160 --> 10:37:45,060
They have Starlord ult here.

12730
10:37:45,780 --> 10:37:46,940
We have Luna ult.

12731
10:37:47,760 --> 10:37:49,020
I'm gonna damage boost you.

12732
10:37:51,360 --> 10:37:52,440
I'll do it again.

12733
10:38:00,120 --> 10:38:01,580
Oh, Magneto, we got Magneto.

12734
10:38:07,680 --> 10:38:08,640
Jesus Christ.

12735
10:38:08,800 --> 10:38:11,100
We got Luna, Luna, yeah.

12736
10:38:12,900 --> 10:38:13,800
Nice, nice, nice.

12737
10:38:16,200 --> 10:38:17,440
I'm coming for you.

12738
10:38:18,520 --> 10:38:19,720
Oh, I'm coming on.

12739
10:38:24,020 --> 10:38:26,210
Alright, let's go!

12740
10:38:27,280 --> 10:38:28,020
Starlord no ult.

12741
10:38:36,020 --> 10:38:37,220
We can, we can, just listen.

12742
10:38:42,950 --> 10:38:44,410
Is Starlord to the top left?

12743
10:38:48,240 --> 10:38:49,170
Jesus Christ.

12744
10:38:52,950 --> 10:38:54,670
Oh my god.

12745
10:38:58,570 --> 10:38:59,470
Magneto half.

12746
10:39:02,690 --> 10:39:03,250
Nice.

12747
10:39:04,050 --> 10:39:04,650
I need to re...

12748
10:39:06,490 --> 10:39:07,610
Psylocke half.

12749
10:39:13,290 --> 10:39:14,270
That's fine, that's fine.

12750
10:39:15,750 --> 10:39:16,810
I'm backing up a little bit.

12751
10:39:20,470 --> 10:39:21,550
They're on leaves.

12752
10:39:23,890 --> 10:39:24,710
Magneto half.

12753
10:39:25,110 --> 10:39:25,930
Magneto's so low.

12754
10:39:28,170 --> 10:39:29,050
Oh shit!

12755
10:39:31,510 --> 10:39:31,950
Again!

12756
10:39:32,230 --> 10:39:32,610
Again.

12757
10:39:33,790 --> 10:39:36,490
If we can kill Luna, we can have a good stagger here.

12758
10:39:37,750 --> 10:39:38,950
I'm damage boosting you guys for it.

12759
10:39:41,090 --> 10:39:41,910
Oh nice, yeah.

12760
10:39:46,390 --> 10:39:48,630
I have ult here for this fight too.

12761
10:39:49,090 --> 10:39:50,470
We might have Luna ult too here.

12762
10:39:52,430 --> 10:39:54,050
I'll let you farm the ult, Luna.

12763
10:40:00,310 --> 10:40:01,510
I got it, I got it, I got it.

12764
10:40:02,790 --> 10:40:03,650
Stay near me if you can.

12765
10:40:05,690 --> 10:40:07,990
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

12766
10:40:09,310 --> 10:40:10,950
That's behind us, that's behind us, that's behind us!

12767
10:40:14,770 --> 10:40:15,990
I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.

12768
10:40:20,390 --> 10:40:20,670
Starlord!

12769
10:40:21,790 --> 10:40:22,070
Starlord!

12770
10:40:24,130 --> 10:40:25,390
Starlord one, Starlord one, Starlord one.

12771
10:40:27,810 --> 10:40:28,850
Oh my god!

12772
10:40:30,870 --> 10:40:32,330
We did it!

12773
10:40:34,490 --> 10:40:36,250
We fucking did it!

12774
10:40:38,690 --> 10:40:41,610
I don't know why he, I don't know why he did it.

12775
10:40:41,710 --> 10:40:42,710
He fell like that.

12776
10:40:42,970 --> 10:40:44,950
He just let's me slap him.

12777
10:40:45,750 --> 10:40:47,590
I was like, alright, slap.

12778
10:40:52,550 --> 10:40:54,690
I fucking, I just slapped him.

12779
10:40:55,510 --> 10:40:56,830
I was like, okay, I'll take it.

12780
10:40:56,910 --> 10:40:57,930
I'll take the slap.

12781
10:41:03,580 --> 10:41:10,040
Oh, the one more win and then we'll be free for today.

12782
10:41:10,180 --> 10:41:13,100
We'll be free for today.

12783
10:41:15,020 --> 10:41:17,900
What a fucking...

12784
10:41:23,040 --> 10:41:24,120
It's okay.

12785
10:41:24,760 --> 10:41:29,800
The cutoff's gonna be 250, but like, I can't, I can't, guys.

12786
10:41:30,520 --> 10:41:32,660
It's gonna be fucking rough, guys.

12787
10:41:33,060 --> 10:41:34,940
I can't.

12788
10:41:36,480 --> 10:41:39,560
250's gonna be the cutoff for the end of the...

12789
10:41:39,560 --> 10:41:43,140
End of the season, I can tell.

12790
10:41:43,700 --> 10:41:54,320
As somebody that, as somebody that has like, calculated cutoff for Overwatch seasons for, for so long.

12791
10:41:54,600 --> 10:41:56,340
I can tell it's gonna be 250.

12792
10:41:57,000 --> 10:42:00,200
It's either 250 or 270, 260.

12793
10:42:00,620 --> 10:42:04,360
Because it's climbing at least like, 10 points a day.

12794
10:42:05,920 --> 10:42:10,240
And we have, I feel like maybe the last day it could climb even faster.

12795
10:42:10,660 --> 10:42:16,340
So if it does go over 250, if I feel like it's gonna go over 250, I might have to climb to 270.

12796
10:42:17,280 --> 10:42:18,580
I might just need one more win.

12797
10:42:19,360 --> 10:42:20,680
I'll just min-max it.

12798
10:42:23,480 --> 10:42:25,660
I will min-max it.

12799
10:42:31,290 --> 10:42:33,690
That's right, I'm not shameless.

12800
10:42:34,610 --> 10:42:35,650
I'm sh- No, I am shameless.

12801
10:42:35,850 --> 10:42:37,190
That's right, I am shameless.

12802
10:42:37,690 --> 10:42:38,950
Is that the, oh...

12803
10:42:39,810 --> 10:42:40,950
Oh, that's the...

12804
10:42:42,270 --> 10:42:43,270
Insta guy.

12805
10:42:43,670 --> 10:42:45,270
Does he have like a...

12806
10:42:45,270 --> 10:42:45,930
Oh my god.

12807
10:42:51,490 --> 10:42:52,450
Kind of trauma.

12808
10:42:52,590 --> 10:42:53,490
Oh, the usual.

12809
10:42:54,310 --> 10:42:56,390
The usual that justifies my hate.

12810
10:42:59,960 --> 10:43:01,040
I'm Luna Snow.

12811
10:43:01,500 --> 10:43:04,100
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

12812
10:43:04,400 --> 10:43:05,940
And Black Panther.

12813
10:43:07,160 --> 10:43:07,440
Hello.

12814
10:43:08,320 --> 10:43:08,760
Do we?

12815
10:43:08,980 --> 10:43:10,540
I think we might have.

12816
10:43:10,740 --> 10:43:12,840
Who am I gonna ban from this match?

12817
10:43:13,500 --> 10:43:14,160
We'll be fine.

12818
10:43:16,120 --> 10:43:17,800
Mister, what is the NSA doing?

12819
10:43:18,220 --> 10:43:18,920
I'm just drinking.

12820
10:43:19,100 --> 10:43:21,060
I have like, a lot of water with me.

12821
10:43:21,300 --> 10:43:21,880
Yeah, me too.

12822
10:43:22,800 --> 10:43:23,460
Yeah, yeah.

12823
10:43:24,440 --> 10:43:27,060
I always have water on me.

12824
10:43:27,060 --> 10:43:29,640
We'll probably have to ban.

12825
10:43:31,120 --> 10:43:32,000
Probably have to ban.

12826
10:43:32,060 --> 10:43:32,740
Well, I'm limiting actually.

12827
10:43:33,760 --> 10:43:34,840
We need to ban Panther.

12828
10:43:35,920 --> 10:43:36,340
Yeah, he is.

12829
10:43:37,560 --> 10:43:39,140
Am I gonna ban Black Panther?

12830
10:43:39,480 --> 10:43:39,680
Alright.

12831
10:43:40,540 --> 10:43:41,240
MVP probably.

12832
10:43:42,140 --> 10:43:45,060
I'm kinda scared of letting Ulti free, but...

12833
10:43:45,700 --> 10:43:47,460
I think we have to.

12834
10:43:47,640 --> 10:43:48,460
Hit my second win.

12835
10:43:48,620 --> 10:43:49,160
I've done it.

12836
10:43:49,540 --> 10:43:51,060
He plays a lot of things also, but...

12837
10:43:51,060 --> 10:43:52,620
Guys, I fucking hit my second win.

12838
10:43:52,740 --> 10:43:53,040
It's over.

12839
10:43:53,480 --> 10:43:55,060
It's so over for the enemy team.

12840
10:43:55,420 --> 10:43:56,180
And they banned Wolverine.

12841
10:43:56,180 --> 10:43:57,100
Okay, he's free.

12842
10:43:58,220 --> 10:44:00,160
How am I still up?

12843
10:44:02,160 --> 10:44:03,960
I love Marvel Rivals.

12844
10:44:10,120 --> 10:44:11,840
I love Marvel Rivals.

12845
10:44:12,880 --> 10:44:14,860
We'll have to play really aggressive against Okai.

12846
10:44:18,040 --> 10:44:19,920
My sheer force of will.

12847
10:44:20,200 --> 10:44:22,660
I am used to the grind.

12848
10:44:26,780 --> 10:44:28,460
I'm just so used to the grind.

12849
10:44:30,380 --> 10:44:31,940
I told you guys.

12850
10:44:32,320 --> 10:44:37,080
I used to, when I grinded for Apex Legends and Overwatch.

12851
10:44:37,900 --> 10:44:40,280
I would play 15 plus hours everyday.

12852
10:44:41,560 --> 10:44:42,800
And that was everyday.

12853
10:44:44,900 --> 10:44:46,300
This is like...

12854
10:44:46,300 --> 10:44:48,300
Not even that bad.

12855
10:44:48,720 --> 10:44:50,460
Guys, at least now I stream it.

12856
10:44:51,280 --> 10:44:52,880
In the past, I wouldn't even stream.

12857
10:44:53,100 --> 10:44:53,940
I said it before.

12858
10:44:53,940 --> 10:44:58,020
But the Bark Knights have went through several hiatuses.

12859
10:44:58,620 --> 10:45:01,540
Because I would literally disappear just for the grind.

12860
10:45:02,080 --> 10:45:03,540
I would cease to exist.

12861
10:45:04,140 --> 10:45:05,100
And they'll be like...

12862
10:45:05,100 --> 10:45:07,360
I wonder where Doki Bird is.

12863
10:45:13,800 --> 10:45:16,420
I'd just be like...

12864
10:45:17,360 --> 10:45:18,280
I'd just be like...

12865
10:45:18,280 --> 10:45:18,960
Hey guys, I'm back.

12866
10:45:19,140 --> 10:45:19,640
I got Pred.

12867
10:45:22,260 --> 10:45:23,440
I'm back guys.

12868
10:45:23,940 --> 10:45:24,500
I got Pred.

12869
10:45:28,140 --> 10:45:29,460
There's someone behind us.

12870
10:45:29,940 --> 10:45:30,660
Yeah, up top.

12871
10:45:37,420 --> 10:45:42,220
Clap, clap, clap, clap.

12872
10:45:42,480 --> 10:45:43,340
I got Hawkeye.

12873
10:45:44,200 --> 10:45:46,480
That was intentional.

12874
10:45:54,800 --> 10:45:56,040
Gotta reload.

12875
10:45:57,760 --> 10:45:59,260
Gotta reload my hands.

12876
10:46:01,140 --> 10:46:02,680
Intended kill!

12877
10:46:07,160 --> 10:46:07,960
Okay,

12878
10:46:11,600 --> 10:46:13,340
but what if we actually aim for 200?

12879
10:46:14,500 --> 10:46:15,280
What if...

12880
10:46:15,280 --> 10:46:18,100
What if this is where everything changes?

12881
10:46:20,000 --> 10:46:21,080
Guys, what if...

12882
10:46:22,560 --> 10:46:23,800
What if this is it?

12883
10:46:25,580 --> 10:46:27,320
This is where everything changes, guys.

12884
10:46:27,500 --> 10:46:28,080
What if...

12885
10:46:28,860 --> 10:46:30,580
What if it just never ends?

12886
10:46:31,160 --> 10:46:32,120
What if...

12887
10:46:36,980 --> 10:46:38,340
I hear Sylak behind us.

12888
10:46:40,060 --> 10:46:41,360
Oh, I thought...

12889
10:46:41,360 --> 10:46:43,520
I legitimately predicted the seconds wrong.

12890
10:46:47,320 --> 10:46:48,700
I got you, I got you.

12891
10:46:51,080 --> 10:46:54,760
We need to get kills here, we win this.

12892
10:46:55,460 --> 10:46:56,500
Yeah, you gotta push up, push up.

12893
10:46:56,960 --> 10:46:58,740
We can Mantis ult first if we need to.

12894
10:47:01,760 --> 10:47:02,120
Woah!

12895
10:47:03,340 --> 10:47:04,220
There's Thrall to our left.

12896
10:47:08,200 --> 10:47:09,920
That's fine, just don't use anything.

12897
10:47:13,980 --> 10:47:14,340
Okay.

12898
10:47:15,500 --> 10:47:15,860
No!

12899
10:47:18,740 --> 10:47:19,780
They used...

12900
10:47:21,120 --> 10:47:21,640
Magneto...

12901
10:47:21,640 --> 10:47:22,640
And what else?

12902
10:47:23,480 --> 10:47:23,920
And Mantis.

12903
10:47:24,040 --> 10:47:24,520
Mantis?

12904
10:47:24,620 --> 10:47:24,780
Okay.

12905
10:47:30,100 --> 10:47:32,260
Oh yeah, I'll Luna for Sylak.

12906
10:47:32,520 --> 10:47:34,360
Yeah, I'll Luna for Sylak.

12907
10:47:35,360 --> 10:47:36,800
Kill him, kill him.

12908
10:47:36,960 --> 10:47:37,380
Focus him.

12909
10:47:43,280 --> 10:47:45,260
I have a Sylak right behind me.

12910
10:47:46,660 --> 10:47:47,500
I need help.

12911
10:47:48,800 --> 10:47:52,220
I have Sylak right behind me.

12912
10:47:53,160 --> 10:47:56,840
You have no Luna heals.

12913
10:48:01,380 --> 10:48:02,840
Oh my god.

12914
10:48:03,260 --> 10:48:05,580
Nobody protected me.

12915
10:48:07,400 --> 10:48:10,100
Nobody protected me.

12916
10:48:15,860 --> 10:48:19,000
Where was my health?

12917
10:48:23,560 --> 10:48:27,440
Literally, I just needed a second.

12918
10:48:29,480 --> 10:48:30,040
Woah.

12919
10:48:31,620 --> 10:48:32,200
I'm dodging.

12920
10:48:36,220 --> 10:48:37,260
Jesus Christ.

12921
10:48:37,780 --> 10:48:38,860
Jesus Christ.

12922
10:48:41,400 --> 10:48:43,100
We no like this.

12923
10:48:43,440 --> 10:48:45,260
We no like...

12924
10:48:45,260 --> 10:48:46,180
We no like this.

12925
10:48:46,180 --> 10:48:47,400
We have to get him.

12926
10:48:49,100 --> 10:48:49,900
Okay, get back.

12927
10:48:53,880 --> 10:48:57,300
I haven't been able to use my fucking freeze.

12928
10:48:57,640 --> 10:48:59,080
Oh my god!

12929
10:49:00,040 --> 10:49:01,240
It's really hard for us to contest.

12930
10:49:03,400 --> 10:49:04,740
There's a Hawkeye to the right.

12931
10:49:05,600 --> 10:49:06,440
I froze him, I froze him.

12932
10:49:06,480 --> 10:49:06,940
He's frozen.

12933
10:49:09,240 --> 10:49:11,520
That was a fucking sick freeze.

12934
10:49:11,720 --> 10:49:12,400
Come on.

12935
10:49:14,000 --> 10:49:15,340
My shield is down.

12936
10:49:16,960 --> 10:49:17,440
Oh.

12937
10:49:21,340 --> 10:49:23,140
Guys, why did we not ban Hawkeye?

12938
10:49:23,560 --> 10:49:24,320
Guys, why did we?

12939
10:49:24,780 --> 10:49:26,440
Why did we?

12940
10:49:27,240 --> 10:49:27,720
Guys!

12941
10:49:29,840 --> 10:49:30,880
Sylak one, Sylak one, Sylak one.

12942
10:49:33,080 --> 10:49:33,560
Here.

12943
10:49:39,040 --> 10:49:41,100
I hear someone behind us.

12944
10:49:42,220 --> 10:49:43,320
I hear Sylak, Sylak, Sylak.

12945
10:49:44,360 --> 10:49:45,100
Sylak one.

12946
10:49:46,180 --> 10:49:47,120
We need to deal with Hawkeye.

12947
10:49:47,260 --> 10:49:48,660
I'm moving towards him.

12948
10:49:54,180 --> 10:49:56,040
Hawkeye main, Hawkeye main.

12949
10:49:58,360 --> 10:49:59,260
I have to reload.

12950
10:50:05,400 --> 10:50:05,880
Jesus!

12951
10:50:06,420 --> 10:50:08,220
Oh my god, I healed you through all that.

12952
10:50:14,890 --> 10:50:15,570
Oh my god.

12953
10:50:17,450 --> 10:50:18,410
Careful, careful, careful.

12954
10:50:18,830 --> 10:50:19,250
He's one.

12955
10:50:21,390 --> 10:50:23,770
We just need to kill the Hawkeye!

12956
10:50:23,910 --> 10:50:26,770
Why did we ban Hawkeye?

12957
10:50:30,900 --> 10:50:32,540
Oh my god, I got Hawkeye'd.

12958
10:50:35,980 --> 10:50:36,500
Please!

12959
10:50:41,120 --> 10:50:44,240
Sylak and I are playing like chicken right now.

12960
10:50:44,500 --> 10:50:50,400
We're like, we're like, I won't ult if you don't ult, Sylak.

12961
10:50:51,640 --> 10:50:52,360
Legitimately.

12962
10:50:57,920 --> 10:50:58,960
I'm right side, right side.

12963
10:51:02,840 --> 10:51:04,520
There's a Sylak on me, there's a Sylak.

12964
10:51:10,660 --> 10:51:11,420
Jesus Christ.

12965
10:51:12,200 --> 10:51:13,140
There's an Immortar, right?

12966
10:51:15,280 --> 10:51:15,700
I don't know.

12967
10:51:16,840 --> 10:51:18,140
I froze the Magnia.

12968
10:51:20,860 --> 10:51:21,540
She's one, she's one.

12969
10:51:22,880 --> 10:51:24,120
I hear Sylak next to me.

12970
10:51:24,120 --> 10:51:24,920
There's a Sylak.

12971
10:51:30,620 --> 10:51:31,500
I couldn't.

12972
10:51:34,380 --> 10:51:36,120
Yeah, it's close against a Hawkeye.

12973
10:51:37,620 --> 10:51:40,040
Yeah, Sylak kept saving her ult for mine.

12974
10:51:40,140 --> 10:51:43,620
I mean, if we ban Hawkeye, then they're gonna go something else.

12975
10:51:44,460 --> 10:51:45,920
There's always gonna be something over.

12976
10:51:46,460 --> 10:51:50,060
Yeah, but Hawkeye is like the worst character in the game right now.

12977
10:51:51,080 --> 10:51:52,860
Yes, but then they will play Banner.

12978
10:51:53,580 --> 10:51:56,700
Honestly, honestly playing against a Black Panther, I can put my squids there.

12979
10:51:56,980 --> 10:51:58,060
What can I do against Hawkeye?

12980
10:51:58,140 --> 10:51:58,400
Nothing.

12981
10:51:59,480 --> 10:52:00,360
This sucks.

12982
10:52:00,580 --> 10:52:01,320
I couldn't even ult.

12983
10:52:01,560 --> 10:52:02,140
Maybe we go...

12984
10:52:04,180 --> 10:52:04,660
I go Mag.

12985
10:52:05,120 --> 10:52:05,940
I go Adam.

12986
10:52:06,820 --> 10:52:07,980
And we go triple support.

12987
10:52:08,360 --> 10:52:09,200
Go Adam and Loki.

12988
10:52:11,560 --> 10:52:12,420
Adam and Loki?

12989
10:52:14,660 --> 10:52:16,040
Yeah, that's a lot of support.

12990
10:52:16,040 --> 10:52:17,320
I mean, I don't think we go all support.

12991
10:52:17,840 --> 10:52:19,440
I think you stay, I think.

12992
10:52:19,440 --> 10:52:22,420
Swap the Luna for Loki and then go Adam.

12993
10:52:22,580 --> 10:52:23,540
Do you play Loki?

12994
10:52:24,440 --> 10:52:26,800
Maybe she plays slow Mantis and you go Loki.

12995
10:52:26,960 --> 10:52:29,080
I can play Loki, but it might be good.

12996
10:52:29,780 --> 10:52:30,440
I can do Adam.

12997
10:52:34,280 --> 10:52:35,960
I don't trust myself on...

12998
10:52:35,960 --> 10:52:37,800
We can't play like when I can tank against...

12999
10:52:37,800 --> 10:52:38,960
We need... No, no, no.

13000
10:52:39,080 --> 10:52:39,640
We can.

13001
10:52:39,940 --> 10:52:41,420
Why can't we go one tank?

13002
10:52:41,720 --> 10:52:43,100
What are we gonna do with two tanks?

13003
10:52:46,920 --> 10:52:47,860
We can try this.

13004
10:52:47,860 --> 10:52:48,680
I'm just sad.

13005
10:52:48,800 --> 10:52:49,460
I couldn't even Luna.

13006
10:52:50,040 --> 10:52:55,220
That Psylocke literally saved her ult for mine the entire time.

13007
10:52:55,340 --> 10:52:56,620
And then she only ults when I die.

13008
10:52:58,260 --> 10:53:00,860
But then I die from fucking...

13009
10:53:01,640 --> 10:53:03,860
I die from fucking Hawkeye.

13010
10:53:04,760 --> 10:53:06,020
It's like the worst part.

13011
10:53:12,460 --> 10:53:14,320
This is gonna be a little fucking scary.

13012
10:53:16,860 --> 10:53:18,660
It's just a Hawkeye diff.

13013
10:53:23,500 --> 10:53:25,560
Jesus Christ, I hope he lives.

13014
10:53:30,380 --> 10:53:31,340
Hawkeye top left.

13015
10:53:31,940 --> 10:53:33,340
No, he's still up there.

13016
10:53:41,940 --> 10:53:44,160
He's just standing in front of us.

13017
10:53:45,820 --> 10:53:47,490
Oh my gosh.

13018
10:53:49,460 --> 10:53:52,040
I have Psylocke on me now.

13019
10:53:59,820 --> 10:54:02,840
It's actually a Hawkeye diff.

13020
10:54:05,320 --> 10:54:06,220
What do we do?

13021
10:54:08,800 --> 10:54:09,340
I still bonded.

13022
10:54:12,270 --> 10:54:13,560
I'm on Psylocke.

13023
10:54:15,880 --> 10:54:18,160
There's a Psylocke on me, there's a Psylocke on me.

13024
10:54:20,200 --> 10:54:22,360
Come on, let me live.

13025
10:54:26,980 --> 10:54:27,440
Please.

13026
10:54:28,780 --> 10:54:29,700
Please.

13027
10:54:32,700 --> 10:54:33,620
Goodbye,

13028
10:54:36,980 --> 10:54:37,440
everybody.

13029
10:54:38,520 --> 10:54:39,300
Goodbye.

13030
10:54:40,460 --> 10:54:40,960
Goodbye.

13031
10:54:41,820 --> 10:54:43,000
I can't live.

13032
10:54:43,000 --> 10:54:46,560
But they won't let me live.

13033
10:54:51,360 --> 10:54:56,910
Oh my God, he did it.

13034
10:54:57,890 --> 10:54:59,510
I'm so proud of you.

13035
10:55:01,090 --> 10:55:01,770
No more slow.

13036
10:55:14,750 --> 10:55:16,110
There's a Psylocke to our left.

13037
10:55:28,310 --> 10:55:30,590
Oh my God, they rushed me.

13038
10:55:44,750 --> 10:55:45,730
That's huge, that's huge.

13039
10:55:48,950 --> 10:55:50,350
Mantis is low, Mantis half.

13040
10:55:52,850 --> 10:55:54,830
I heard a Psylocke behind us.

13041
10:55:55,070 --> 10:55:56,990
Oh, now he's in front of us.

13042
10:56:07,910 --> 10:56:08,430
I'm scared.

13043
10:56:14,750 --> 10:56:15,010
Left side.

13044
10:56:16,490 --> 10:56:17,350
Hawkeye left side.

13045
10:56:17,450 --> 10:56:18,390
I'm going to go with them.

13046
10:56:18,650 --> 10:56:19,330
Give me a sec.

13047
10:56:20,530 --> 10:56:22,110
I heard Psylocke behind us.

13048
10:56:22,470 --> 10:56:23,630
I hit everyone, everyone, everyone.

13049
10:56:27,790 --> 10:56:29,510
I got you.

13050
10:56:33,450 --> 10:56:34,550
Loki needs help.

13051
10:56:35,190 --> 10:56:36,390
He's one, he's one, Loki.

13052
10:56:41,450 --> 10:56:42,350
There's no more, there's one.

13053
10:56:42,470 --> 10:56:43,510
I can't heal you from there.

13054
10:56:44,750 --> 10:56:45,270
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.

13055
10:56:45,370 --> 10:56:46,110
I got you, I got you.

13056
10:56:47,150 --> 10:56:47,930
I have ult.

13057
10:56:49,770 --> 10:56:50,610
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

13058
10:56:50,750 --> 10:56:51,990
I got ult soon, I got ult soon again.

13059
10:56:55,650 --> 10:56:57,470
We just got to temporize.

13060
10:56:58,110 --> 10:56:58,870
Yeah, I was going to swap.

13061
10:56:59,250 --> 10:56:59,470
There's an Ironman.

13062
10:57:02,130 --> 10:57:02,810
He's one, he's one.

13063
10:57:06,430 --> 10:57:07,590
I'm a little scared.

13064
10:57:12,900 --> 10:57:14,160
I'm a little scared.

13065
10:57:15,740 --> 10:57:16,700
He's too far.

13066
10:57:20,000 --> 10:57:21,040
Jesus Christ.

13067
10:57:22,580 --> 10:57:24,040
Oh my god.

13068
10:57:24,740 --> 10:57:25,740
That'll be fun, right?

13069
10:57:30,320 --> 10:57:35,120
I hate him, I hate him.

13070
10:57:35,340 --> 10:57:36,300
Left side, left side.

13071
10:57:40,140 --> 10:57:42,900
I'm bling, I'm bling, I'm bling.

13072
10:57:44,160 --> 10:57:44,380
Ironman.

13073
10:57:47,620 --> 10:57:49,120
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

13074
10:57:51,420 --> 10:57:52,260
Behind you.

13075
10:57:55,240 --> 10:57:56,500
We're fine, we're fine.

13076
10:58:01,660 --> 10:58:02,500
Jesus Christ.

13077
10:58:02,740 --> 10:58:03,400
Left side, left side.

13078
10:58:05,180 --> 10:58:05,940
Blink, maybe.

13079
10:58:06,840 --> 10:58:07,380
No, there's one.

13080
10:58:07,600 --> 10:58:08,520
No, I'm dead 100%.

13081
10:58:08,520 --> 10:58:09,680
I have TP if we can kill.

13082
10:58:09,740 --> 10:58:10,020
Okay.

13083
10:58:11,320 --> 10:58:11,880
Goodbye.

13084
10:58:12,980 --> 10:58:14,040
I'm going for you.

13085
10:58:16,260 --> 10:58:17,700
I give you heals there.

13086
10:58:22,500 --> 10:58:24,080
I'm concluding all.

13087
10:58:26,300 --> 10:58:27,580
Oh my god.

13088
10:58:28,540 --> 10:58:29,820
There was nothing we could do.

13089
10:58:30,360 --> 10:58:34,400
Their Hawkeye was so good that it shut us down there.

13090
10:58:38,040 --> 10:58:39,360
Oh my god, this is why.

13091
10:58:39,420 --> 10:58:41,260
This is exactly why I ban Hawkeye.

13092
10:58:41,260 --> 10:58:43,440
I never trust anybody.

13093
10:58:43,440 --> 10:58:46,720
I never trust anyone that says they can diff that Hawkeye.

13094
10:58:49,900 --> 10:58:52,880
I'll never trust them again.

13095
10:58:53,660 --> 10:58:56,420
This is a never-ending nightmare.

13096
10:59:03,920 --> 10:59:08,040
I never trust anybody.

13097
10:59:08,480 --> 10:59:10,760
Every time they're like, don't worry, I'm a better Hawkeye.

13098
10:59:10,760 --> 10:59:13,160
I'll never trust you.

13099
10:59:13,300 --> 10:59:17,660
There's no such thing as a better Hawkeye.

13100
10:59:20,810 --> 10:59:24,490
It's always their Hawkeye, not my Hawkeye.

13101
10:59:25,070 --> 10:59:26,630
The fuck is that bullshit?

13102
10:59:29,950 --> 10:59:31,770
Is this what hell is like?

13103
10:59:34,550 --> 10:59:36,470
No, this is purgatory.

13104
10:59:38,230 --> 10:59:40,170
They always bait me.

13105
10:59:40,170 --> 10:59:43,770
They bait me with the like...

13106
10:59:43,770 --> 10:59:47,210
With the appeal of maybe you'll get it.

13107
10:59:47,650 --> 10:59:48,430
And then they...

13108
10:59:49,530 --> 10:59:51,750
It's always a fucking bait.

13109
10:59:53,990 --> 10:59:56,670
They give a Twitch prime, then you're like, thank you.

13110
10:59:57,550 --> 10:59:59,750
They're like, maybe this is it.

13111
10:59:59,850 --> 11:00:01,650
Maybe this is the game where...

13112
11:00:01,650 --> 11:00:03,810
You might get it.

13113
11:00:08,060 --> 11:00:09,820
I'm in actual purgatory.

13114
11:00:12,500 --> 11:00:15,900
I just suffer for the enjoyment of it.

13115
11:00:23,270 --> 11:00:24,750
I believe.

13116
11:00:25,110 --> 11:00:25,670
It's okay.

13117
11:00:26,410 --> 11:00:28,470
This is where the win streak starts, right?

13118
11:00:29,550 --> 11:00:30,910
This is where it starts.

13119
11:00:31,390 --> 11:00:32,610
What in...

13120
11:00:33,470 --> 11:00:34,210
Alright.

13121
11:00:38,790 --> 11:00:41,930
Oh my god, we're finally in...

13122
11:00:41,930 --> 11:00:43,650
Wait, wait, we're in...

13123
11:00:43,650 --> 11:00:44,870
Oh my god.

13124
11:00:45,690 --> 11:00:46,390
Guys.

13125
11:00:47,450 --> 11:00:52,570
I haven't seen a yellow ping in so long.

13126
11:00:53,010 --> 11:00:54,550
Holy fuck.

13127
11:00:55,510 --> 11:00:56,670
I have...

13128
11:00:56,670 --> 11:00:57,870
Oh my god.

13129
11:00:57,950 --> 11:01:00,710
I haven't seen it in color yet.

13130
11:01:01,850 --> 11:01:02,710
You know what that means?

13131
11:01:02,770 --> 11:01:04,190
I'm back in one ping territory.

13132
11:01:04,570 --> 11:01:05,430
I'm back.

13133
11:01:05,870 --> 11:01:07,570
We did it.

13134
11:01:09,290 --> 11:01:10,690
Oh my god.

13135
11:01:10,930 --> 11:01:12,150
NA ping?

13136
11:01:12,230 --> 11:01:13,370
What is this?

13137
11:01:15,690 --> 11:01:18,070
I would be fucked up if I banned Wolverine.

13138
11:01:20,990 --> 11:01:22,250
I'm so back.

13139
11:01:23,250 --> 11:01:24,930
I'm so back, guys.

13140
11:01:32,200 --> 11:01:33,480
Here we go.

13141
11:01:42,790 --> 11:01:43,090
Alright.

13142
11:01:43,570 --> 11:01:46,590
Oh my god, it's actual normal hours now.

13143
11:01:49,690 --> 11:01:50,130
God.

13144
11:01:50,530 --> 11:01:52,090
Why is my panther player an ultimate panther?

13145
11:01:52,370 --> 11:01:53,870
The morning people are up.

13146
11:01:53,870 --> 11:01:56,770
The morning people are actually up.

13147
11:01:57,110 --> 11:01:58,050
Oh my god.

13148
11:01:58,310 --> 11:02:00,810
I've never streamed in morning hours before.

13149
11:02:01,090 --> 11:02:02,270
This is fucking crazy.

13150
11:02:02,930 --> 11:02:04,630
This is new territory.

13151
11:02:05,310 --> 11:02:07,770
This is actual new territory for me.

13152
11:02:09,110 --> 11:02:10,510
I streamed for so long.

13153
11:02:10,610 --> 11:02:12,610
It's 9.30 in the morning.

13154
11:02:17,770 --> 11:02:19,170
Isn't it wonderful?

13155
11:02:19,770 --> 11:02:20,930
We're so back.

13156
11:02:21,250 --> 11:02:21,930
We're so back.

13157
11:02:21,930 --> 11:02:23,810
Guys, the sun is out.

13158
11:02:25,770 --> 11:02:26,930
We're so back.

13159
11:02:28,130 --> 11:02:30,870
I wake up and then it's back to Marvel Rivals.

13160
11:02:31,150 --> 11:02:35,210
I'm sorry.

13161
11:02:35,730 --> 11:02:36,570
I'm sorry.

13162
11:02:36,950 --> 11:02:38,930
Stay strong, dragoons.

13163
11:02:39,170 --> 11:02:40,710
Four more days.

13164
11:02:42,050 --> 11:02:42,890
Guys.

13165
11:02:43,430 --> 11:02:45,930
Four more days, dragoons.

13166
11:02:51,930 --> 11:02:53,070
Oh no.

13167
11:03:00,860 --> 11:03:01,580
What?

13168
11:03:01,820 --> 11:03:03,200
I have a widow.

13169
11:03:09,330 --> 11:03:11,030
I got the bitch.

13170
11:03:11,990 --> 11:03:13,230
Oh, you're low.

13171
11:03:13,950 --> 11:03:14,390
I'm okay.

13172
11:03:14,490 --> 11:03:14,650
You're low.

13173
11:03:15,510 --> 11:03:16,210
Yeah.

13174
11:03:16,650 --> 11:03:16,810
I'm fine.

13175
11:03:19,070 --> 11:03:22,470
They're to the right.

13176
11:03:23,610 --> 11:03:24,450
I'm very high ground.

13177
11:03:27,070 --> 11:03:27,870
Watch out.

13178
11:03:30,370 --> 11:03:31,230
Lowkey's half.

13179
11:03:31,370 --> 11:03:31,730
Lowkey's low.

13180
11:03:31,750 --> 11:03:32,130
Lowkey won.

13181
11:03:32,790 --> 11:03:32,970
He's dead.

13182
11:03:36,370 --> 11:03:37,850
I slept the mantis.

13183
11:03:40,310 --> 11:03:42,710
I'm getting bullied by this widow.

13184
11:03:45,850 --> 11:03:46,650
Where's widow?

13185
11:03:47,030 --> 11:03:47,330
Oh.

13186
11:03:47,970 --> 11:03:49,090
Hooked me five times.

13187
11:03:49,390 --> 11:03:49,690
Woah.

13188
11:03:50,650 --> 11:03:51,250
Woah.

13189
11:03:51,250 --> 11:03:51,770
Woah.

13190
11:03:52,750 --> 11:03:54,950
He's the sniper master.

13191
11:04:04,050 --> 11:04:08,790
I'm a little scared to peek this sniper.

13192
11:04:10,710 --> 11:04:13,390
I have shields in the fight.

13193
11:04:21,170 --> 11:04:22,130
Oh shit.

13194
11:04:23,170 --> 11:04:24,050
Well, mantis all first here.

13195
11:04:24,390 --> 11:04:24,790
I'm so slow, bro.

13196
11:04:24,910 --> 11:04:25,810
I can't move.

13197
11:04:26,910 --> 11:04:27,570
I'm mantis.

13198
11:04:27,790 --> 11:04:28,070
Oh.

13199
11:04:28,510 --> 11:04:28,990
Oh.

13200
11:04:29,030 --> 11:04:29,470
Okay.

13201
11:04:29,990 --> 11:04:30,970
I thought we were mantis.

13202
11:04:32,810 --> 11:04:33,990
We double support ult.

13203
11:04:34,050 --> 11:04:34,850
You gotta get some heals.

13204
11:04:34,850 --> 11:04:35,090
I'm good.

13205
11:04:37,450 --> 11:04:38,430
I can hit him.

13206
11:04:39,530 --> 11:04:40,010
Wait.

13207
11:04:40,850 --> 11:04:41,330
Okay.

13208
11:04:43,550 --> 11:04:44,690
No more to the right.

13209
11:04:48,430 --> 11:04:51,090
I see him.

13210
11:04:51,230 --> 11:04:51,870
I see him.

13211
11:04:52,050 --> 11:04:52,070
I see him.

13212
11:04:52,070 --> 11:04:52,130
I see him.

13213
11:04:53,410 --> 11:04:54,850
Oh, there's one way.

13214
11:04:55,090 --> 11:04:55,830
Fucking god, bro.

13215
11:04:57,190 --> 11:04:57,430
Okay.

13216
11:04:58,330 --> 11:04:59,850
The strange is blocking me.

13217
11:05:05,650 --> 11:05:08,010
I don't know why I fucking jumped there.

13218
11:05:08,010 --> 11:05:09,690
There's a widow to our far right.

13219
11:05:12,410 --> 11:05:14,030
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

13220
11:05:18,980 --> 11:05:20,460
Oh, I'm asleep too.

13221
11:05:20,780 --> 11:05:21,440
Oh, you can actually.

13222
11:05:27,500 --> 11:05:29,880
What the fuck are you doing here?

13223
11:05:33,260 --> 11:05:34,160
That sucks.

13224
11:05:34,880 --> 11:05:36,240
Oh, we have Luna ult first.

13225
11:05:36,680 --> 11:05:37,380
Okay, so...

13226
11:05:38,320 --> 11:05:39,380
We can Luna ult first.

13227
11:05:39,560 --> 11:05:40,280
Are you triple support?

13228
11:05:40,460 --> 11:05:41,420
Oh, the triple support.

13229
11:05:41,520 --> 11:05:42,500
I just realized that.

13230
11:05:43,200 --> 11:05:45,420
We can Luna ult first for the next fight since you have it.

13231
11:05:53,740 --> 11:05:54,860
I'm a little scared.

13232
11:05:56,160 --> 11:05:57,020
Yeah, I can use it first.

13233
11:06:00,180 --> 11:06:00,580
Oh.

13234
11:06:01,480 --> 11:06:02,780
That's strange to do still.

13235
11:06:04,260 --> 11:06:05,880
I'm a little scared here.

13236
11:06:07,400 --> 11:06:08,460
He's backing up.

13237
11:06:10,860 --> 11:06:11,900
I found one.

13238
11:06:12,260 --> 11:06:12,780
I'm with you.

13239
11:06:13,020 --> 11:06:13,920
Loki's still alive.

13240
11:06:13,960 --> 11:06:14,460
Loki's low.

13241
11:06:15,380 --> 11:06:16,180
They're all in the back.

13242
11:06:19,060 --> 11:06:19,660
Careful.

13243
11:06:28,200 --> 11:06:29,500
You guys are way deep in.

13244
11:06:32,260 --> 11:06:33,540
I'm backing out.

13245
11:06:35,340 --> 11:06:35,940
Choo-choo.

13246
11:06:42,840 --> 11:06:43,120
Whoa.

13247
11:06:43,860 --> 11:06:44,420
Where's the sniper?

13248
11:06:47,140 --> 11:06:48,180
So, I need to stop with it.

13249
11:06:50,580 --> 11:06:51,140
Oh.

13250
11:06:52,240 --> 11:06:53,640
That's a little awkward.

13251
11:06:54,880 --> 11:06:55,860
I'm ulting this.

13252
11:06:57,240 --> 11:06:57,600
I'm just pinging.

13253
11:06:58,140 --> 11:06:58,980
I'm just pinging.

13254
11:06:59,740 --> 11:07:00,980
I slept him.

13255
11:07:01,040 --> 11:07:01,380
I slept him.

13256
11:07:03,780 --> 11:07:04,900
Oh my god.

13257
11:07:05,780 --> 11:07:06,720
I'm dead.

13258
11:07:07,540 --> 11:07:08,340
We have no support.

13259
11:07:17,670 --> 11:07:18,530
Like it?

13260
11:07:20,610 --> 11:07:22,090
How do they have triple support?

13261
11:07:24,150 --> 11:07:25,190
That's so fucked.

13262
11:07:28,650 --> 11:07:29,710
That's so fucked.

13263
11:07:30,490 --> 11:07:31,370
Like, what do I do?

13264
11:07:39,130 --> 11:07:40,130
Oh my god.

13265
11:07:40,490 --> 11:07:41,130
They have no shield.

13266
11:07:41,890 --> 11:07:42,490
I broke it.

13267
11:07:43,930 --> 11:07:45,670
Oh, keep our Punisher alive.

13268
11:07:49,070 --> 11:07:50,570
Damage boosted you.

13269
11:07:54,100 --> 11:07:54,890
Oh my god.

13270
11:07:55,110 --> 11:07:58,010
Oh, well.

13271
11:07:58,710 --> 11:07:59,730
Oh.

13272
11:08:00,110 --> 11:08:01,090
We're down two.

13273
11:08:13,860 --> 11:08:15,730
He has no shield.

13274
11:08:25,470 --> 11:08:27,010
I'm trying to keep you up.

13275
11:08:29,990 --> 11:08:31,070
Our damage boosted you.

13276
11:08:32,230 --> 11:08:32,590
I'm ulting.

13277
11:08:33,110 --> 11:08:33,490
I'm ulting now.

13278
11:08:34,630 --> 11:08:35,530
I got you.

13279
11:08:35,650 --> 11:08:36,510
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

13280
11:08:36,930 --> 11:08:37,330
Go, go, go.

13281
11:08:37,830 --> 11:08:39,070
I'm so slow.

13282
11:08:40,170 --> 11:08:40,910
No one, no one.

13283
11:08:41,010 --> 11:08:42,210
The supports are really slow.

13284
11:08:43,490 --> 11:08:44,010
They're one.

13285
11:08:44,170 --> 11:08:44,290
They're one.

13286
11:08:45,030 --> 11:08:45,510
I'm one.

13287
11:08:45,570 --> 11:08:46,390
I got you.

13288
11:08:46,450 --> 11:08:46,710
I got you.

13289
11:08:46,750 --> 11:08:47,090
I got you.

13290
11:08:48,170 --> 11:08:48,710
They're low.

13291
11:08:48,850 --> 11:08:49,030
They're low.

13292
11:08:49,510 --> 11:08:49,910
I'm fine.

13293
11:08:51,670 --> 11:08:52,290
I'm fine.

13294
11:08:53,410 --> 11:08:54,530
I have ult for last fight.

13295
11:08:59,920 --> 11:09:01,180
There's a Widow up top.

13296
11:09:01,520 --> 11:09:01,860
Thanks.

13297
11:09:06,700 --> 11:09:07,420
I'm gonna look.

13298
11:09:08,080 --> 11:09:09,160
10 seconds.

13299
11:09:09,900 --> 11:09:17,600
Oh my god.

13300
11:09:17,660 --> 11:09:20,140
Guys, I'm fucking so focused right now.

13301
11:09:20,460 --> 11:09:20,900
They have strangers.

13302
11:09:20,900 --> 11:09:23,300
We are undefeatable!

13303
11:09:25,400 --> 11:09:26,340
I have ult.

13304
11:09:26,540 --> 11:09:27,040
This is for us.

13305
11:09:27,160 --> 11:09:28,160
We are undefeatable!

13306
11:09:30,740 --> 11:09:31,180
I have ult too.

13307
11:09:31,640 --> 11:09:33,600
I am ready to throw a fit.

13308
11:09:33,880 --> 11:09:34,960
No more behind us.

13309
11:09:38,780 --> 11:09:39,700
He's asleep, he's asleep!

13310
11:09:39,840 --> 11:09:40,300
Oh no!

13311
11:09:40,400 --> 11:09:41,020
I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him.

13312
11:09:41,780 --> 11:09:42,300
I'm dead.

13313
11:09:44,840 --> 11:09:45,240
No!

13314
11:09:45,940 --> 11:09:46,760
He was asleep!

13315
11:09:49,180 --> 11:09:50,160
We should win this, maybe.

13316
11:09:51,880 --> 11:09:53,480
I don't know who can touch.

13317
11:09:56,160 --> 11:09:57,520
You can do it, Luna.

13318
11:09:58,020 --> 11:09:59,400
You cannot do it, Luna.

13319
11:09:59,600 --> 11:10:00,900
Go back, go back, go back, go back.

13320
11:10:04,420 --> 11:10:05,640
You can do it!

13321
11:10:06,240 --> 11:10:06,640
Nevermind.

13322
11:10:06,840 --> 11:10:08,300
Let me go back now.

13323
11:10:13,390 --> 11:10:14,890
Oh god, I don't fucking wanna...

13324
11:10:15,470 --> 11:10:16,690
Wait, we're so low!

13325
11:10:16,990 --> 11:10:19,750
Oh no.

13326
11:10:34,020 --> 11:10:34,740
Jesus Christ.

13327
11:10:35,280 --> 11:10:35,420
Oh!

13328
11:10:41,930 --> 11:10:42,650
I'm scared.

13329
11:10:43,970 --> 11:10:44,690
I'm scared.

13330
11:10:46,510 --> 11:10:48,030
We'll help our Black Panther if we can.

13331
11:10:49,310 --> 11:10:50,330
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

13332
11:10:50,410 --> 11:10:50,910
Oh yeah, okay, nice.

13333
11:10:51,870 --> 11:10:52,110
Oh!

13334
11:10:53,870 --> 11:10:54,550
String is so low!

13335
11:11:00,190 --> 11:11:00,550
Oh...

13336
11:11:03,030 --> 11:11:03,350
Oh...

13337
11:11:03,350 --> 11:11:04,150
Basket, what?

13338
11:11:05,370 --> 11:11:06,650
There's a Mantis behind us.

13339
11:11:06,770 --> 11:11:07,250
I'm asleep.

13340
11:11:11,430 --> 11:11:14,110
I'm going to get it because I'm so slow, I can't move around.

13341
11:11:14,370 --> 11:11:14,670
I need it.

13342
11:11:16,350 --> 11:11:16,950
String, String, String!

13343
11:11:18,690 --> 11:11:19,830
We almost have Mantis, we almost have Mantis.

13344
11:11:20,630 --> 11:11:21,290
93, 93.

13345
11:11:21,750 --> 11:11:23,450
Give me the Mantis, give me the Mantis now.

13346
11:11:24,670 --> 11:11:25,490
I have it, I have it, I have it.

13347
11:11:27,070 --> 11:11:27,750
We got Mantis, we got Mantis.

13348
11:11:27,950 --> 11:11:29,270
I'm going, I'm going, I'm melting now.

13349
11:11:32,090 --> 11:11:33,570
Let's leave, there's Stranger.

13350
11:11:33,890 --> 11:11:34,910
Stranger's one, Stranger's one!

13351
11:11:35,050 --> 11:11:35,550
Stranger's one, Stranger's one.

13352
11:11:41,020 --> 11:11:43,080
I see him, I see him, I see him.

13353
11:11:44,020 --> 11:11:44,460
I got him.

13354
11:11:44,460 --> 11:11:45,420
Mantis, Mantis half, Mantis half.

13355
11:11:45,420 --> 11:11:46,540
Mantis low, Mantis low, Mantis half.

13356
11:11:47,920 --> 11:11:49,200
I got her, I got her, I got her.

13357
11:11:51,020 --> 11:11:51,460
Nice.

13358
11:11:53,780 --> 11:11:54,900
Oh my god.

13359
11:11:55,460 --> 11:11:57,180
Just chucking it.

13360
11:11:57,400 --> 11:11:59,980
God, this is such a stupid comp to play against.

13361
11:12:01,500 --> 11:12:02,980
It's such a stupid...

13362
11:12:04,300 --> 11:12:06,680
I hate this comp that we're playing against.

13363
11:12:06,760 --> 11:12:07,780
And I hate...

13364
11:12:07,780 --> 11:12:08,160
I hate...

13365
11:12:08,720 --> 11:12:09,740
Oh my god.

13366
11:12:10,620 --> 11:12:12,280
I have to lock in.

13367
11:12:12,400 --> 11:12:14,120
I have to lock in.

13368
11:12:16,160 --> 11:12:18,220
Scott, thank you for the 100 bitties.

13369
11:12:18,440 --> 11:12:19,380
Thank you, thank you.

13370
11:12:19,560 --> 11:12:21,080
Manny, thank you for the 100 bitties.

13371
11:12:22,500 --> 11:12:24,080
Hazru, thank you for the tier 1 subs.

13372
11:12:24,100 --> 11:12:24,920
Thank you.

13373
11:12:25,060 --> 11:12:26,580
I have to lock in for this.

13374
11:12:26,700 --> 11:12:27,000
I'm so...

13375
11:12:27,500 --> 11:12:29,880
Oh my god, I have to be so fucking focused here.

13376
11:12:33,380 --> 11:12:35,340
There's just too many supports.

13377
11:12:35,700 --> 11:12:37,560
There's too many supports.

13378
11:12:38,400 --> 11:12:39,360
Just because...

13379
11:12:39,360 --> 11:12:39,880
They were like...

13380
11:12:39,880 --> 11:12:41,280
I hear like three...

13381
11:12:41,280 --> 11:12:43,580
I hear like three Luna ults.

13382
11:12:43,660 --> 11:12:44,400
And I'm like, what?

13383
11:12:46,420 --> 11:12:47,060
No.

13384
11:12:49,460 --> 11:12:50,360
Why you need...

13385
11:12:50,360 --> 11:12:52,860
Why you need those skins when we're getting rival games?

13386
11:13:01,340 --> 11:13:03,740
Yeah, I thought you said we haven't lost.

13387
11:13:06,140 --> 11:13:06,860
Bro,

13388
11:13:11,720 --> 11:13:14,480
even our stack doesn't even believe that.

13389
11:13:14,940 --> 11:13:19,060
Even the Doki Bird fan account doesn't even believe that.

13390
11:13:23,360 --> 11:13:26,660
I walked against the wall, that's not good.

13391
11:13:31,340 --> 11:13:33,420
Alright, my shield's broke.

13392
11:13:33,880 --> 11:13:35,520
I'm going to contest top, I'm going to contest top.

13393
11:13:37,360 --> 11:13:38,420
Oh my god.

13394
11:13:39,080 --> 11:13:40,520
I took so much damage.

13395
11:13:43,600 --> 11:13:45,720
We're taking so much damage.

13396
11:13:45,840 --> 11:13:46,180
This is going to be really hard.

13397
11:13:46,720 --> 11:13:47,440
This is going to be really hard.

13398
11:13:53,620 --> 11:13:54,800
I'm just waiting.

13399
11:13:58,260 --> 11:13:59,860
I can't peek from main.

13400
11:14:00,100 --> 11:14:00,180
We need to.

13401
11:14:00,840 --> 11:14:02,960
We need to surround a little bit.

13402
11:14:03,380 --> 11:14:04,700
We need to force them into a position.

13403
11:14:06,060 --> 11:14:07,200
We need to kill the clones.

13404
11:14:11,920 --> 11:14:12,680
Jesus Christ.

13405
11:14:12,840 --> 11:14:14,380
I have to do that just to...

13406
11:14:15,340 --> 11:14:16,460
I damage boosted you.

13407
11:14:20,600 --> 11:14:21,760
There's one, there's one.

13408
11:14:21,900 --> 11:14:22,320
Nice, nice, nice.

13409
11:14:27,360 --> 11:14:28,400
String tap, string tap.

13410
11:14:33,380 --> 11:14:35,220
I can heal you guys from there.

13411
11:14:37,320 --> 11:14:40,180
I slept him, I slept him.

13412
11:14:40,280 --> 11:14:41,360
You can kill him.

13413
11:14:46,980 --> 11:14:47,740
I'm dead.

13414
11:14:48,420 --> 11:14:49,380
I got whaled.

13415
11:14:56,020 --> 11:14:57,460
I have ult in 20.

13416
11:14:59,620 --> 11:15:00,760
Sniper on the right, watch out.

13417
11:15:02,160 --> 11:15:02,660
There's squids.

13418
11:15:02,740 --> 11:15:03,760
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

13419
11:15:09,540 --> 11:15:11,300
No more sleep, no more sleep.

13420
11:15:13,060 --> 11:15:13,940
Where's one, where's one?

13421
11:15:14,740 --> 11:15:15,440
Backline, I'm backline.

13422
11:15:19,860 --> 11:15:21,040
String, string, string, string, guys.

13423
11:15:21,180 --> 11:15:21,740
String, string, string.

13424
11:15:22,200 --> 11:15:22,660
String's one.

13425
11:15:27,300 --> 11:15:29,380
I'm on point, I'm on point.

13426
11:15:31,060 --> 11:15:33,280
We can't help you, we can't heal you dude.

13427
11:15:38,480 --> 11:15:39,860
We're so healthy.

13428
11:15:40,340 --> 11:15:43,720
I can damage boost you.

13429
11:15:46,760 --> 11:15:48,240
Oh, you're doing that thing.

13430
11:15:52,800 --> 11:15:55,180
Okay, I'm gonna damage boost your stupid thing.

13431
11:15:55,180 --> 11:15:55,620
Ding.

13432
11:15:57,900 --> 11:15:58,840
I can't even.

13433
11:15:59,020 --> 11:15:59,220
They're just hiding.

13434
11:15:59,860 --> 11:16:01,240
They're terrified of my next step.

13435
11:16:03,120 --> 11:16:03,920
Sniper mid-life.

13436
11:16:04,560 --> 11:16:05,340
Okay, get ready guys.

13437
11:16:05,600 --> 11:16:06,820
I'm about to lean into them.

13438
11:16:07,720 --> 11:16:09,340
The mantis is by herself right there.

13439
11:16:11,080 --> 11:16:11,560
Go!

13440
11:16:14,740 --> 11:16:15,500
How do I?

13441
11:16:16,000 --> 11:16:16,760
Do you just keep shot?

13442
11:16:17,120 --> 11:16:17,860
I don't know.

13443
11:16:17,980 --> 11:16:19,180
Dude, double support ulted.

13444
11:16:19,420 --> 11:16:21,420
There's a mantis right behind us.

13445
11:16:23,380 --> 11:16:24,740
Live, live, live, live, live, live, live.

13446
11:16:24,740 --> 11:16:25,280
I'm ulting this.

13447
11:16:28,400 --> 11:16:32,840
Oh, I should live this, yeah?

13448
11:16:33,280 --> 11:16:33,560
Yeah.

13449
11:16:34,260 --> 11:16:35,340
Change one, change one, change.

13450
11:16:37,140 --> 11:16:37,920
Change the ult.

13451
11:16:40,720 --> 11:16:41,740
What the fuck?

13452
11:16:41,840 --> 11:16:42,340
Get out of here.

13453
11:16:43,880 --> 11:16:45,260
I'm trying to get you up.

13454
11:16:56,340 --> 11:16:57,380
I'm not gonna use it though.

13455
11:16:57,600 --> 11:16:58,360
I'm helping.

13456
11:17:01,300 --> 11:17:02,760
Not the will.

13457
11:17:03,360 --> 11:17:04,960
Not the will.

13458
11:17:08,640 --> 11:17:09,360
Wow!

13459
11:17:16,200 --> 11:17:16,540
What?

13460
11:17:16,700 --> 11:17:17,800
Oh, that's my bad.

13461
11:17:19,560 --> 11:17:21,080
I didn't see it.

13462
11:17:21,160 --> 11:17:21,800
I didn't see it.

13463
11:17:22,420 --> 11:17:28,020
I didn't see sniper master.

13464
11:17:28,280 --> 11:17:28,940
My bad.

13465
11:17:31,260 --> 11:17:33,000
I was definitely...

13466
11:17:36,060 --> 11:17:37,500
I don't wanna peek.

13467
11:17:37,620 --> 11:17:39,040
I'm scared of sniper master.

13468
11:17:41,020 --> 11:17:42,860
Sniper master might come over.

13469
11:17:44,460 --> 11:17:44,960
Okay, let's go.

13470
11:17:46,260 --> 11:17:46,680
Let's do it.

13471
11:17:49,680 --> 11:17:51,580
On point, on point, on point.

13472
11:17:54,380 --> 11:17:55,140
At the cap point.

13473
11:17:57,140 --> 11:17:58,220
Four seconds, three seconds.

13474
11:17:59,140 --> 11:18:00,520
I'm gonna ult this, I'm gonna ult this, I'm gonna ult this.

13475
11:18:00,520 --> 11:18:01,480
No one's getting me though.

13476
11:18:08,620 --> 11:18:10,140
Oh my god.

13477
11:18:15,560 --> 11:18:17,640
I don't know what to do for you.

13478
11:18:18,700 --> 11:18:20,100
Oh my god.

13479
11:18:20,140 --> 11:18:20,600
I got...

13480
11:18:21,240 --> 11:18:21,820
Got whaled.

13481
11:18:25,640 --> 11:18:27,880
Got fucking whaled.

13482
11:18:29,400 --> 11:18:31,140
I was so slow.

13483
11:18:31,280 --> 11:18:32,660
Do I run away?

13484
11:18:33,220 --> 11:18:33,740
We can play next.

13485
11:18:34,500 --> 11:18:36,240
We're playing two flankers in two anymore.

13486
11:18:43,580 --> 11:18:45,360
What do I do?

13487
11:18:47,680 --> 11:18:49,740
A little peeking, a little peeking, a little peeking.

13488
11:18:51,380 --> 11:18:57,000
I'm doing one, two, three, go.

13489
11:18:58,520 --> 11:19:00,220
Damage boost to you two.

13490
11:19:00,560 --> 11:19:01,560
No one, no one, no one, no one.

13491
11:19:07,060 --> 11:19:09,780
Oh my god, I'm so scared of this fucking sniper.

13492
11:19:14,480 --> 11:19:16,080
Help our Pantheon, help our Pantheon.

13493
11:19:16,380 --> 11:19:17,220
We can play, we can play.

13494
11:19:17,220 --> 11:19:17,680
Nice, nice, nice.

13495
11:19:18,080 --> 11:19:18,720
I'm ulting this.

13496
11:19:20,240 --> 11:19:23,540
I got the ult, but...

13497
11:19:23,540 --> 11:19:24,260
Okay, I'm staying.

13498
11:19:24,900 --> 11:19:25,820
Look at Mantis, look at Mantis.

13499
11:19:26,820 --> 11:19:27,920
I'm asleep, I'm asleep.

13500
11:19:28,000 --> 11:19:28,940
I'm pushing right now, baby.

13501
11:19:29,820 --> 11:19:33,800
I do, I do, I do.

13502
11:19:37,400 --> 11:19:38,280
Oh no.

13503
11:19:40,700 --> 11:19:42,220
I'm looking at the strange.

13504
11:19:48,320 --> 11:19:49,520
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

13505
11:19:49,700 --> 11:19:50,660
I'm asleep, I'm asleep.

13506
11:19:51,720 --> 11:19:53,460
Not the fucking way.

13507
11:19:58,880 --> 11:20:02,120
Oh my god, it's the fucking way.

13508
11:20:04,680 --> 11:20:07,520
Guys, I'm in, I'm in purgatory.

13509
11:20:08,220 --> 11:20:10,740
I'm in, I'm in fucking purgatory.

13510
11:20:11,100 --> 11:20:14,090
I'm in, I'm in purgatory.

13511
11:20:22,340 --> 11:20:23,920
Where do I run?

13512
11:20:25,820 --> 11:20:25,980
Where do I run?

13513
11:20:30,800 --> 11:20:33,200
What do you mean?

13514
11:20:33,560 --> 11:20:33,940
Run!

13515
11:20:41,360 --> 11:20:43,820
It's like one second.

13516
11:20:44,520 --> 11:20:47,560
See you on my main account one day.

13517
11:20:47,820 --> 11:20:48,480
What?

13518
11:20:49,660 --> 11:20:50,920
Jesus Christ.

13519
11:20:53,340 --> 11:20:54,180
Oh my god.

13520
11:20:55,380 --> 11:20:56,920
I'm just like, where?

13521
11:20:56,920 --> 11:20:59,140
How do I get away?

13522
11:21:00,580 --> 11:21:04,980
I cannot respond that fast.

13523
11:21:05,640 --> 11:21:07,340
I'm going to use the bath to be right back.

13524
11:22:09,280 --> 11:22:10,200
Hello.

13525
11:22:11,320 --> 11:22:11,580
Hello.

13526
11:22:13,400 --> 11:22:13,760
Goodbye.

13527
11:22:16,160 --> 11:22:19,600
I come back and I see a rocket raccoon.

13528
11:22:19,600 --> 11:22:20,680
Have I like fallen?

13529
11:22:25,680 --> 11:22:27,440
An OTP no more?

13530
11:22:31,000 --> 11:22:31,980
Oh shit.

13531
11:22:33,320 --> 11:22:35,620
Whoops, I literally heard Black Panther.

13532
11:22:36,460 --> 11:22:37,460
Oh man.

13533
11:22:38,400 --> 11:22:40,780
Wouldn't it be funny if it, oh thank god, I was going to say.

13534
11:22:41,820 --> 11:22:44,240
I'll never escape the rocket raccoon.

13535
11:22:49,780 --> 11:22:52,040
Is me hydrating, it's a cycle.

13536
11:22:52,280 --> 11:22:55,500
Just like how I keep losing and gaining, it's a fucking cycle.

13537
11:22:59,880 --> 11:23:01,660
It's a cycle of abuse.

13538
11:23:08,320 --> 11:23:09,680
I fuck with that heavily.

13539
11:23:14,080 --> 11:23:14,600
True.

13540
11:23:17,020 --> 11:23:19,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, let Doki play support.

13541
11:23:20,400 --> 11:23:22,160
Yaren go tank or something.

13542
11:23:24,400 --> 11:23:27,080
Yaren just go tank or some shit.

13543
11:23:30,600 --> 11:23:32,400
Wait, am I 12 hours deep?

13544
11:23:32,520 --> 11:23:34,000
Oh my god, I'm too far gone.

13545
11:23:34,240 --> 11:23:36,480
I'm actually too far gone.

13546
11:23:40,620 --> 11:23:44,700
I'm a Twitch, oh my god, I'm fucking embodying Twitch streaming.

13547
11:23:47,380 --> 11:23:48,780
I'm too far gone.

13548
11:23:51,340 --> 11:23:57,480
I didn't even notice I was at 12, this is actually, no this isn't the longest stream I've ever done.

13549
11:23:58,540 --> 11:24:03,820
What's crazy is that I've hit my second win so I'm not tired at all.

13550
11:24:06,660 --> 11:24:10,620
I'm losing it guys, I'm losing it.

13551
11:24:12,560 --> 11:24:13,940
I'm just fucking it.

13552
11:24:14,680 --> 11:24:16,400
I'm gonna...

13553
11:24:16,400 --> 11:24:18,940
I'm gonna go sleep right aw... no I shouldn't sleep.

13554
11:24:19,540 --> 11:24:22,840
I need to walk, I need to walk my dog and then...

13555
11:24:22,840 --> 11:24:25,380
and then we do it all over again.

13556
11:24:29,880 --> 11:24:31,600
Where's my Ironman?

13557
11:24:32,020 --> 11:24:32,860
There it is.

13558
11:24:36,120 --> 11:24:36,720
Surely...

13559
11:24:38,580 --> 11:24:39,180
Surely...

13560
11:24:40,060 --> 11:24:44,200
Oh my god, surely he lives those, right?

13561
11:24:44,480 --> 11:24:45,120
No, he does.

13562
11:24:46,080 --> 11:24:46,860
He fucking does.

13563
11:24:47,720 --> 11:24:48,780
He fucking lives those.

13564
11:24:49,780 --> 11:24:51,360
I knew he lives those.

13565
11:24:53,220 --> 11:24:54,780
Fucking know it.

13566
11:24:57,240 --> 11:24:59,820
I know he fucking lives those.

13567
11:25:00,820 --> 11:25:01,660
He's a gamer!

13568
11:25:04,890 --> 11:25:05,760
He's a gamer!

13569
11:25:05,760 --> 11:25:05,820
He's a gamer!

13570
11:25:08,340 --> 11:25:09,980
Oh, he wasn't though.

13571
11:25:10,500 --> 11:25:11,820
He's not gaming.

13572
11:25:12,260 --> 11:25:13,760
He's not gaming.

13573
11:25:16,500 --> 11:25:18,640
Oh my god,

13574
11:25:22,260 --> 11:25:22,660
please.

13575
11:25:24,320 --> 11:25:26,200
Jesus Christ.

13576
11:25:29,360 --> 11:25:30,520
Please.

13577
11:25:32,760 --> 11:25:34,560
Holy shit!

13578
11:25:35,760 --> 11:25:36,540
We both won.

13579
11:25:38,420 --> 11:25:40,040
I lowkey agree.

13580
11:25:42,200 --> 11:25:44,700
I'm not okay.

13581
11:25:45,340 --> 11:25:49,720
I'm... I'm not okay right now.

13582
11:25:50,880 --> 11:25:54,420
I don't know how I lived that long.

13583
11:25:56,020 --> 11:25:58,960
I'm not okay.

13584
11:25:59,600 --> 11:26:00,820
We got strength, we got strength.

13585
11:26:05,900 --> 11:26:07,320
Oh, he angry.

13586
11:26:11,200 --> 11:26:12,920
I'm pushing up, I'm pushing up with this.

13587
11:26:16,880 --> 11:26:20,300
I'm backing out in 3, 2, 1...

13588
11:26:20,300 --> 11:26:24,740
Oh shit!

13589
11:26:26,080 --> 11:26:26,720
Hulk is half.

13590
11:26:30,440 --> 11:26:31,560
I can...

13591
11:26:32,360 --> 11:26:33,260
Bruce, Bruce, Bruce!

13592
11:26:35,480 --> 11:26:37,260
Oh shit, nice!

13593
11:26:41,740 --> 11:26:43,980
That was the one thing he said.

13594
11:26:44,340 --> 11:26:45,500
Damn, bro!

13595
11:26:54,900 --> 11:26:55,860
I need a build.

13596
11:26:56,200 --> 11:26:56,200
I'll try.

13597
11:27:02,960 --> 11:27:03,660
Break what?

13598
11:27:03,820 --> 11:27:04,380
Break what?

13599
11:27:06,380 --> 11:27:06,780
What?

13600
11:27:12,100 --> 11:27:12,820
There's no way.

13601
11:27:12,900 --> 11:27:13,300
What's his ring?

13602
11:27:13,380 --> 11:27:13,900
What's his ring?

13603
11:27:19,340 --> 11:27:20,660
That Hulk has his ult.

13604
11:27:23,480 --> 11:27:24,160
I frozen.

13605
11:27:25,940 --> 11:27:27,520
Hulk is on the Raccoon and I.

13606
11:27:29,820 --> 11:27:30,820
He's still on us.

13607
11:27:31,060 --> 11:27:31,440
We need help.

13608
11:27:32,560 --> 11:27:33,060
No!

13609
11:27:33,520 --> 11:27:34,900
You have no hands!

13610
11:27:36,480 --> 11:27:38,720
I hate Raccoon players.

13611
11:27:39,460 --> 11:27:43,580
I hate them so much.

13612
11:27:45,260 --> 11:27:53,180
I fucking hate Raccoon players.

13613
11:27:54,920 --> 11:27:56,260
Behind us, behind us, behind us!

13614
11:28:02,920 --> 11:28:05,300
I'm trying, I'm trying so I can ult this.

13615
11:28:08,240 --> 11:28:09,340
Hulk is low, Hulk is low.

13616
11:28:20,840 --> 11:28:22,140
Starla's gonna have ult for next fight.

13617
11:28:26,560 --> 11:28:29,980
All I'm saying is that...

13618
11:28:29,980 --> 11:28:32,260
He can't peel!

13619
11:28:35,360 --> 11:28:36,900
He doesn't peel!

13620
11:28:37,460 --> 11:28:39,520
He just dashes away!

13621
11:28:39,880 --> 11:28:41,460
Strange one, strange one, strange one!

13622
11:28:48,760 --> 11:28:50,020
I'll push up, I'll push up.

13623
11:28:50,200 --> 11:28:51,580
You push cart, Raccoon.

13624
11:28:53,840 --> 11:28:54,560
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk!

13625
11:28:54,560 --> 11:28:55,720
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk!

13626
11:28:58,980 --> 11:29:00,280
Hulk is half still.

13627
11:29:02,380 --> 11:29:03,740
Get back, get back now, get back, get back, get back.

13628
11:29:04,020 --> 11:29:05,100
We need to rein this one.

13629
11:29:07,000 --> 11:29:08,120
He's one, he's one.

13630
11:29:09,640 --> 11:29:10,680
Oh my god.

13631
11:29:12,980 --> 11:29:15,360
Okay, get back.

13632
11:29:24,560 --> 11:29:24,960
Oh my god.

13633
11:29:27,820 --> 11:29:30,500
I'm so fucking focused right now.

13634
11:29:37,940 --> 11:29:39,460
I can't see!

13635
11:29:40,420 --> 11:29:41,000
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk!

13636
11:29:42,080 --> 11:29:42,680
Starlord,

13637
11:29:47,000 --> 11:29:47,260
Starlord!

13638
11:29:49,680 --> 11:29:50,560
Wait, wait, I'm running.

13639
11:29:55,860 --> 11:29:57,180
Nice, I'm not seeing shit.

13640
11:30:04,920 --> 11:30:06,200
Oh, goodbye!

13641
11:30:10,580 --> 11:30:11,900
Oh my god.

13642
11:30:12,860 --> 11:30:14,980
If I ever see a Raccoon calling out, I'm gonna troll.

13643
11:30:15,860 --> 11:30:16,840
I'm calling.

13644
11:30:17,480 --> 11:30:20,020
I don't care what happens to that Raccoon.

13645
11:30:26,980 --> 11:30:29,960
I could've said something really fucked up about Rocky Raccoon.

13646
11:30:30,140 --> 11:30:31,480
And I'm gonna say it.

13647
11:30:31,880 --> 11:30:33,620
He should've died like his friend.

13648
11:30:37,460 --> 11:30:38,020
Sorry.

13649
11:30:38,560 --> 11:30:39,440
I'm sorry.

13650
11:30:41,380 --> 11:30:41,940
Jesus.

13651
11:30:44,060 --> 11:30:45,180
Woah, Doki.

13652
11:30:46,780 --> 11:30:47,860
What did I say?

13653
11:30:47,940 --> 11:30:50,360
I didn't even finish my sentence.

13654
11:30:50,480 --> 11:30:51,080
What did I say?

13655
11:30:52,060 --> 11:30:53,260
What did I say?

13656
11:30:53,460 --> 11:30:54,340
What did I say?

13657
11:30:55,020 --> 11:30:55,580
Woah!

13658
11:30:58,700 --> 11:30:59,880
What did I say?

13659
11:30:59,940 --> 11:31:01,240
I didn't even finish my sentence.

13660
11:31:01,540 --> 11:31:02,580
What did I say?

13661
11:31:06,600 --> 11:31:08,100
He's not even real!

13662
11:31:10,460 --> 11:31:12,160
Who am I offending anybody?

13663
11:31:12,340 --> 11:31:13,080
Who am I offending?

13664
11:31:13,460 --> 11:31:14,920
He's not even real!

13665
11:31:15,440 --> 11:31:19,780
He is real to me.

13666
11:31:27,680 --> 11:31:29,920
Oh, 10 Raccoon views.

13667
11:31:36,380 --> 11:31:39,100
He's not even a real fucking Raccoon.

13668
11:31:39,740 --> 11:31:41,580
He might as well be like...

13669
11:31:41,580 --> 11:31:43,820
He's like 10% Raccoon at this point.

13670
11:31:51,740 --> 11:31:54,180
You know he's less Raccoon now.

13671
11:31:55,580 --> 11:31:56,480
Oh wait, what the fuck?

13672
11:31:57,700 --> 11:31:59,900
He's probably behind us.

13673
11:32:03,460 --> 11:32:05,720
I'm with you, I'm with you.

13674
11:32:05,800 --> 11:32:07,680
He's on me.

13675
11:32:08,040 --> 11:32:08,820
He's on me.

13676
11:32:09,920 --> 11:32:11,140
I froze him, I froze him.

13677
11:32:12,000 --> 11:32:13,080
3, 2, 1.

13678
11:32:14,380 --> 11:32:15,240
Look at that, look at that, look at that.

13679
11:32:16,100 --> 11:32:16,600
Half.

13680
11:32:19,880 --> 11:32:20,380
Nice.

13681
11:32:23,000 --> 11:32:25,460
I believe in Doki Raccoon.

13682
11:32:32,920 --> 11:32:36,220
Yeah, you're a B2R who's real now.

13683
11:32:38,110 --> 11:32:38,940
Found one.

13684
11:32:39,440 --> 11:32:43,340
At least I streamed.

13685
11:32:43,400 --> 11:32:44,660
Raccoon doesn't even stream.

13686
11:32:49,980 --> 11:32:51,600
Oh, I froze somebody.

13687
11:32:52,140 --> 11:32:54,540
Oh my god, you died.

13688
11:32:55,220 --> 11:32:55,740
You died.

13689
11:32:58,180 --> 11:33:00,280
There's a Starlord behind us again.

13690
11:33:05,100 --> 11:33:08,240
Yeah, I'll use it now.

13691
11:33:17,160 --> 11:33:20,620
Okay, 3, 2, 1.

13692
11:33:23,040 --> 11:33:27,520
Oh my god, my experience with Doki.

13693
11:33:28,000 --> 11:33:28,720
He's French.

13694
11:33:30,280 --> 11:33:32,240
I saw you yelling.

13695
11:33:32,700 --> 11:33:37,700
He's a criminal.

13696
11:33:38,280 --> 11:33:40,760
You're supporting a fucking criminal.

13697
11:33:51,900 --> 11:33:53,450
Oh my god, I gotta focus now.

13698
11:33:54,270 --> 11:33:57,330
I gotta ignore my hatred of Raccoons and start focusing.

13699
11:33:58,310 --> 11:33:58,910
There's someone.

13700
11:34:00,190 --> 11:34:02,110
I froze Hulk.

13701
11:34:05,730 --> 11:34:07,580
I'll find her.

13702
11:34:08,310 --> 11:34:09,290
Oh my god.

13703
11:34:09,730 --> 11:34:12,350
There's a Hulk on us.

13704
11:34:15,020 --> 11:34:16,290
I froze him.

13705
11:34:16,790 --> 11:34:18,550
Oh goodbye, we might die here.

13706
11:34:22,670 --> 11:34:25,470
Raccoon and I are definitely dead here.

13707
11:34:26,590 --> 11:34:28,190
I got another one.

13708
11:34:28,330 --> 11:34:29,410
I got another one.

13709
11:34:31,330 --> 11:34:35,970
All I'm saying is if we had literally anybody else.

13710
11:34:36,270 --> 11:34:37,650
Anybody else.

13711
11:34:38,550 --> 11:34:40,930
Other than a fucking rodent.

13712
11:34:41,250 --> 11:34:42,610
I would have lived.

13713
11:34:42,870 --> 11:34:44,950
If we had anybody else.

13714
11:34:45,030 --> 11:34:49,310
Other than this god damn rodent.

13715
11:34:50,390 --> 11:34:52,930
This fucking criminal.

13716
11:34:55,710 --> 11:34:58,130
I am ready to put on a show.

13717
11:35:00,150 --> 11:35:01,210
Oh nice, nice, nice.

13718
11:35:01,670 --> 11:35:02,770
My god.

13719
11:35:03,690 --> 11:35:05,330
This is so mean.

13720
11:35:09,190 --> 11:35:11,350
I can't believe.

13721
11:35:12,910 --> 11:35:13,670
Rodent.

13722
11:35:18,830 --> 11:35:20,290
Rodent slad.

13723
11:35:26,520 --> 11:35:27,280
God.

13724
11:35:28,280 --> 11:35:29,980
But he even has rabies.

13725
11:35:34,390 --> 11:35:35,590
This is fine.

13726
11:35:37,050 --> 11:35:39,090
How do we know he doesn't have rabies?

13727
11:35:39,710 --> 11:35:40,170
Huh?

13728
11:35:40,730 --> 11:35:41,810
How do we know?

13729
11:35:45,010 --> 11:35:45,550
There's me.

13730
11:35:50,730 --> 11:35:51,870
Oh shit.

13731
11:35:52,490 --> 11:35:53,450
Oh fuck.

13732
11:35:53,750 --> 11:35:55,010
Of course it's me.

13733
11:35:55,870 --> 11:35:57,630
Fuck you, Raccoon.

13734
11:35:59,990 --> 11:36:02,010
Fucking lunatic here on my ass, bro.

13735
11:36:02,030 --> 11:36:02,710
I can't kill her.

13736
11:36:08,490 --> 11:36:10,810
I hate this.

13737
11:36:21,910 --> 11:36:22,930
I'm ulting it.

13738
11:36:23,730 --> 11:36:24,870
Nice, nice, nice.

13739
11:36:25,150 --> 11:36:26,730
I'm pushing up with this.

13740
11:36:31,370 --> 11:36:32,330
Whoa.

13741
11:36:32,530 --> 11:36:34,990
There's a Hulk behind us.

13742
11:36:38,570 --> 11:36:41,150
This might be where I die.

13743
11:36:47,090 --> 11:36:49,570
We have a Hulk on us.

13744
11:36:53,410 --> 11:36:56,470
You KDA player, you fucker.

13745
11:36:56,470 --> 11:36:57,110
Fucker.

13746
11:37:00,730 --> 11:37:02,250
What do you mean Seraph does?

13747
11:37:02,470 --> 11:37:03,950
You're a fucking KDA player.

13748
11:37:05,810 --> 11:37:07,450
Watch out, watch out.

13749
11:37:07,590 --> 11:37:08,610
My bad, my bad.

13750
11:37:11,310 --> 11:37:13,590
I am not in my green mecha.

13751
11:37:16,710 --> 11:37:18,610
Yes, it was a lie.

13752
11:37:20,090 --> 11:37:20,850
I hate him.

13753
11:37:21,550 --> 11:37:22,230
I hate him.

13754
11:37:22,730 --> 11:37:23,850
I hate him.

13755
11:37:26,470 --> 11:37:27,410
I froze him.

13756
11:37:33,990 --> 11:37:36,150
I have the Hulk.

13757
11:37:37,320 --> 11:37:38,230
He's on me.

13758
11:37:48,250 --> 11:37:50,170
It's alright, he'll be fine.

13759
11:37:51,510 --> 11:37:52,430
What's he doing?

13760
11:37:52,430 --> 11:37:53,430
He's not gonna die.

13761
11:37:55,810 --> 11:37:58,570
The banner, the banner ban.

13762
11:38:00,010 --> 11:38:00,570
Goodbye.

13763
11:38:07,230 --> 11:38:08,890
He's so low, let's change.

13764
11:38:09,730 --> 11:38:13,650
I swear to God, I swear to God, if you touch me, I swear to God.

13765
11:38:14,430 --> 11:38:15,310
I'm sorry.

13766
11:38:16,170 --> 11:38:18,670
I'm going through some stuff right now.

13767
11:38:22,430 --> 11:38:23,990
2 -2-2.

13768
11:38:26,160 --> 11:38:26,950
We're okay.

13769
11:38:27,870 --> 11:38:29,270
We're okay.

13770
11:38:30,210 --> 11:38:32,230
The fucking Rocket got zeroed in.

13771
11:38:36,690 --> 11:38:38,250
Rocket KDA'd.

13772
11:38:38,930 --> 11:38:40,890
I'm gonna kick something.

13773
11:38:44,890 --> 11:38:45,910
Are you okay?

13774
11:38:46,170 --> 11:38:50,470
No, I literally had the Rocket Raccoon play KDA this entire time.

13775
11:38:50,470 --> 11:38:53,810
I had him fucking play KDA.

13776
11:38:54,250 --> 11:38:56,710
He let me die so many times.

13777
11:38:56,970 --> 11:38:58,590
Fuck this Raccoon.

13778
11:39:02,450 --> 11:39:03,690
Raccoon's right.

13779
11:39:05,230 --> 11:39:06,970
What a fucking bitch.

13780
11:39:07,350 --> 11:39:11,770
He just let the Hulk slap me around.

13781
11:39:11,770 --> 11:39:13,030
He literally...

13782
11:39:18,390 --> 11:39:21,630
Yeah, I wonder why he has more heals.

13783
11:39:21,810 --> 11:39:23,450
After I die.

13784
11:39:24,030 --> 11:39:25,190
I wonder how.

13785
11:39:25,970 --> 11:39:27,070
I wonder how.

13786
11:39:28,330 --> 11:39:33,890
The other support dies because Raccoon doesn't fucking peel for me.

13787
11:39:35,490 --> 11:39:37,070
Just skate away.

13788
11:39:47,700 --> 11:39:48,660
Oh my God.

13789
11:39:49,860 --> 11:39:50,060
Oh.

13790
11:39:52,700 --> 11:39:53,760
You know what?

13791
11:39:55,600 --> 11:39:56,220
Raccoon.

13792
11:39:56,760 --> 11:39:58,860
Can you eat Raccoons?

13793
11:40:01,480 --> 11:40:06,160
Despite what you might think, Raccoon tastes pretty good when cleaned and cooked properly.

13794
11:40:06,340 --> 11:40:10,180
Like dark meat chicken or turkey, though it is greasier and more tender.

13795
11:40:10,540 --> 11:40:12,320
Where can you find a Raccoon to cook?

13796
11:40:12,780 --> 11:40:15,600
Oh shit, can I like eat Raccoons where I live?

13797
11:40:17,540 --> 11:40:18,780
Raccoon restaurants.

13798
11:40:20,080 --> 11:40:20,840
What is it?

13799
11:40:24,240 --> 11:40:27,420
What are the pros and cons of eating Raccoon meat?

13800
11:40:28,080 --> 11:40:30,260
Well, it depends on how old the Raccoon is.

13801
11:40:30,460 --> 11:40:33,600
Older, larger, have a lot of fat, which makes the meat taste funky.

13802
11:40:34,020 --> 11:40:36,160
Oh shit, funky Raccoon meat.

13803
11:40:36,680 --> 11:40:37,580
Yeah, rabies.

13804
11:40:37,640 --> 11:40:39,000
That's what they want you to think.

13805
11:40:44,440 --> 11:40:48,680
That's what they want you to think so you don't eat Raccoon.

13806
11:40:48,680 --> 11:40:52,820
It's fucking false news spread by Raccoon propaganda.

13807
11:41:10,800 --> 11:41:15,560
Since when grew up booger, I can try Hella.

13808
11:41:15,560 --> 11:41:16,720
You stay Wolverine, bro.

13809
11:41:16,860 --> 11:41:18,000
You stay in your lane.

13810
11:41:19,240 --> 11:41:22,600
It's fine, it's fine.

13811
11:41:22,900 --> 11:41:23,580
What do we ban now?

13812
11:41:24,660 --> 11:41:28,700
I mean, I guess if no one is playing Hella, we ban like...

13813
11:41:28,700 --> 11:41:29,580
What about Hawkeye?

13814
11:41:30,140 --> 11:41:31,560
What if they don't ban Hawkeye?

13815
11:41:32,620 --> 11:41:33,700
What if they don't do it?

13816
11:41:33,760 --> 11:41:35,680
Doki, are you talking about eating Raccoons?

13817
11:41:36,960 --> 11:41:37,140
What?

13818
11:41:37,260 --> 11:41:38,060
No way.

13819
11:41:39,600 --> 11:41:41,400
Doki, why would you eat a Raccoon?

13820
11:41:41,600 --> 11:41:43,260
How much protein in a Raccoon, actually?

13821
11:41:43,320 --> 11:41:43,880
I need to check.

13822
11:41:46,840 --> 11:41:49,120
What the fuck?

13823
11:41:49,240 --> 11:41:50,740
Who fucking snitched?

13824
11:41:51,780 --> 11:41:54,420
Who fucking snitched?

13825
11:41:56,900 --> 11:41:59,200
Now they think I'm crazy.

13826
11:41:59,720 --> 11:42:03,260
Now they think you're crazy, Doki.

13827
11:42:07,220 --> 11:42:09,300
My goat.

13828
11:42:18,960 --> 11:42:21,620
Listen, what if you go Venom and we just dive that hook?

13829
11:42:23,220 --> 11:42:24,060
Only now?

13830
11:42:24,580 --> 11:42:26,000
I never tried that.

13831
11:42:26,300 --> 11:42:28,600
It works, but I don't know.

13832
11:42:29,380 --> 11:42:30,300
If in Europe, it works.

13833
11:42:31,540 --> 11:42:32,300
How do we play?

13834
11:42:32,480 --> 11:42:33,440
Where is this comp?

13835
11:42:35,460 --> 11:42:35,880
Alright.

13836
11:42:39,380 --> 11:42:39,800
Restaurants...

13837
11:42:42,720 --> 11:42:43,560
Restaurants, Raccoon.

13838
11:42:45,560 --> 11:42:45,940
Bro.

13839
11:42:53,400 --> 11:42:57,400
How do I... Do any restaurants serve Raccoon near me?

13840
11:42:58,140 --> 11:42:59,480
Raccoons with a view.

13841
11:43:02,960 --> 11:43:06,560
Guys, I just want to know.

13842
11:43:06,620 --> 11:43:09,020
I just want to know if I can eat Raccoon.

13843
11:43:09,280 --> 11:43:12,200
I just want to know if any restaurants near me serve Raccoon.

13844
11:43:12,280 --> 11:43:15,000
Is that really so much to ask for?

13845
11:43:15,000 --> 11:43:17,480
Like, is that really...

13846
11:43:20,320 --> 11:43:20,720
Like...

13847
11:43:24,340 --> 11:43:25,780
Oh my god.

13848
11:43:27,080 --> 11:43:28,560
Oh my god.

13849
11:43:30,760 --> 11:43:32,300
I can slam again, but I have no E.

13850
11:43:33,880 --> 11:43:34,440
I throw a storm.

13851
11:43:34,620 --> 11:43:35,020
I throw a storm.

13852
11:43:35,860 --> 11:43:36,640
I can slam.

13853
11:43:36,940 --> 11:43:38,500
Slamming 3, 2, 1 now.

13854
11:43:39,460 --> 11:43:41,000
I'm on... We can cap point now.

13855
11:43:42,860 --> 11:43:43,520
I'm on cap.

13856
11:43:43,560 --> 11:43:43,880
I'm on cap.

13857
11:43:43,880 --> 11:43:45,020
I'm capping.

13858
11:43:45,140 --> 11:43:45,440
I'm capping.

13859
11:43:45,560 --> 11:43:45,840
I'm capping.

13860
11:43:48,360 --> 11:43:54,260
Okay, but if they're like baby Raccoons, it's fine because they're not like...

13861
11:43:54,260 --> 11:43:56,520
The older they are, the more funky they are.

13862
11:43:56,900 --> 11:43:58,880
So if I eat baby Raccoons...

13863
11:44:01,040 --> 11:44:01,560
Sorry.

13864
11:44:02,080 --> 11:44:06,740
I should stop.

13865
11:44:06,740 --> 11:44:07,200
Alright.

13866
11:44:13,320 --> 11:44:15,260
Guys, I swear I'm... Alright.

13867
11:44:15,520 --> 11:44:17,940
Guys, it's just all... It's hypothetical.

13868
11:44:18,560 --> 11:44:20,200
It's all hypothetical.

13869
11:44:20,480 --> 11:44:24,060
It's not like I'm actually gonna eat baby Raccoons.

13870
11:44:25,240 --> 11:44:25,820
I'm about this.

13871
11:44:29,660 --> 11:44:30,320
Oh.

13872
11:44:30,640 --> 11:44:31,120
Oh.

13873
11:44:31,980 --> 11:44:32,880
That's awkward.

13874
11:44:34,040 --> 11:44:34,880
They're on point.

13875
11:44:35,040 --> 11:44:35,660
Thor's on point.

13876
11:44:37,660 --> 11:44:38,800
I think they're down point.

13877
11:44:39,140 --> 11:44:39,460
Yeah.

13878
11:44:40,220 --> 11:44:41,380
What if he doesn't die?

13879
11:44:41,620 --> 11:44:42,580
What if he locks it?

13880
11:44:42,960 --> 11:44:43,660
What if he's the goat?

13881
11:44:44,160 --> 11:44:45,620
He's already dead.

13882
11:44:48,420 --> 11:44:50,760
Guys, it's just a lack of sleep.

13883
11:44:51,060 --> 11:44:53,000
Guys, it's just a little...

13884
11:44:53,000 --> 11:44:54,780
Too much rival rivals.

13885
11:44:55,220 --> 11:44:59,380
I swear to god, I'm not gonna eat a baby Raccoon yet.

13886
11:45:03,300 --> 11:45:04,260
I froze.

13887
11:45:04,340 --> 11:45:04,860
I froze Penny.

13888
11:45:10,670 --> 11:45:11,490
Mine, mine, mine.

13889
11:45:11,830 --> 11:45:12,110
Nice.

13890
11:45:13,030 --> 11:45:13,570
Penny half?

13891
11:45:13,850 --> 11:45:14,030
Oh.

13892
11:45:19,090 --> 11:45:20,890
Oh, we gotta reset.

13893
11:45:20,990 --> 11:45:21,350
We gotta reset.

13894
11:45:21,530 --> 11:45:21,930
We hit him.

13895
11:45:22,710 --> 11:45:23,210
He's the goat.

13896
11:45:23,310 --> 11:45:23,750
He's the goat.

13897
11:45:23,870 --> 11:45:24,370
He's the goat.

13898
11:45:24,610 --> 11:45:24,970
He's the goat.

13899
11:45:25,130 --> 11:45:25,870
He's my goat.

13900
11:45:25,990 --> 11:45:26,430
On my body.

13901
11:45:26,750 --> 11:45:27,870
We got the kills.

13902
11:45:27,950 --> 11:45:28,390
We got the kills.

13903
11:45:28,710 --> 11:45:29,110
I'm pushing.

13904
11:45:29,330 --> 11:45:29,950
I'm going point.

13905
11:45:30,150 --> 11:45:30,630
Straight point.

13906
11:45:31,070 --> 11:45:31,530
Straight point.

13907
11:45:33,090 --> 11:45:34,430
You have orb.

13908
11:45:36,050 --> 11:45:37,650
I'm moving really fast here, bro.

13909
11:45:41,210 --> 11:45:42,530
You made me angry.

13910
11:45:42,530 --> 11:45:43,750
Put orb on me if you can.

13911
11:45:43,990 --> 11:45:45,150
They have Hawkeye out here.

13912
11:45:48,590 --> 11:45:49,070
Look at them.

13913
11:45:49,130 --> 11:45:49,350
Look at them.

13914
11:45:49,390 --> 11:45:49,890
Look at them.

13915
11:45:50,090 --> 11:45:50,430
Keep an eye.

13916
11:45:50,510 --> 11:45:50,710
Keep an eye.

13917
11:45:54,620 --> 11:45:55,320
I'm killing the mine.

13918
11:45:55,940 --> 11:45:56,260
Jesus Christ.

13919
11:45:57,300 --> 11:45:58,000
I'm killing that one.

13920
11:45:58,120 --> 11:45:58,380
I'm killing that one.

13921
11:45:58,380 --> 11:45:59,740
Jesus Christ.

13922
11:46:00,740 --> 11:46:02,220
You are all so low.

13923
11:46:04,700 --> 11:46:05,280
You can't see me.

13924
11:46:05,300 --> 11:46:05,700
You can't see me.

13925
11:46:06,720 --> 11:46:07,220
Play it cool.

13926
11:46:07,280 --> 11:46:07,360
Play it cool.

13927
11:46:07,400 --> 11:46:08,140
Coronation is dead.

13928
11:46:09,400 --> 11:46:09,980
I'll kite one.

13929
11:46:11,020 --> 11:46:11,900
I have no tanks.

13930
11:46:11,900 --> 11:46:13,800
Okay, I think we go top fight honestly.

13931
11:46:14,240 --> 11:46:16,420
We have one.

13932
11:46:16,520 --> 11:46:16,920
Last fight.

13933
11:46:17,040 --> 11:46:17,480
Last fight.

13934
11:46:23,120 --> 11:46:23,920
Who touches?

13935
11:46:26,620 --> 11:46:27,420
Good question.

13936
11:46:27,780 --> 11:46:30,040
I think we as a team can touch together.

13937
11:46:30,700 --> 11:46:31,480
We got pick.

13938
11:46:31,580 --> 11:46:31,920
We got pick.

13939
11:46:33,260 --> 11:46:35,000
We got two picks.

13940
11:46:35,080 --> 11:46:35,480
We got two picks.

13941
11:46:35,540 --> 11:46:35,940
We got touch.

13942
11:46:38,140 --> 11:46:38,820
We got top.

13943
11:46:39,000 --> 11:46:39,120
Top.

13944
11:46:39,120 --> 11:46:39,120
Top.

13945
11:46:40,100 --> 11:46:40,500
Penny.

13946
11:46:40,640 --> 11:46:40,760
Penny.

13947
11:46:40,860 --> 11:46:40,980
Penny.

13948
11:46:43,840 --> 11:46:44,320
Nice.

13949
11:46:44,940 --> 11:46:45,000
Hawkeye.

13950
11:46:45,040 --> 11:46:45,220
Hawkeye.

13951
11:46:45,320 --> 11:46:46,020
Push Hawkeye if you can.

13952
11:46:46,320 --> 11:46:46,780
Hawkeye is low.

13953
11:46:46,940 --> 11:46:47,280
So low.

13954
11:46:54,120 --> 11:46:55,840
We only have one fight here.

13955
11:46:56,000 --> 11:46:56,900
They have Sorrel here.

13956
11:46:57,960 --> 11:46:58,420
And Penny.

13957
11:46:58,600 --> 11:46:59,320
Not Penny.

13958
11:46:59,520 --> 11:47:00,000
Hawkeye.

13959
11:47:03,220 --> 11:47:04,180
Careful Hawkeye.

13960
11:47:09,740 --> 11:47:10,620
Oh my god.

13961
11:47:10,620 --> 11:47:12,980
We are undefeated.

13962
11:47:15,270 --> 11:47:15,490
Akira.

13963
11:47:15,730 --> 11:47:15,730
Akira.

13964
11:47:17,070 --> 11:47:17,870
Sorrel is behind.

13965
11:47:21,910 --> 11:47:22,470
I'm ulting.

13966
11:47:22,590 --> 11:47:22,750
I'm ulting.

13967
11:47:22,870 --> 11:47:23,030
I'm ulting.

13968
11:47:23,290 --> 11:47:25,190
I am ready to put on a show.

13969
11:47:25,610 --> 11:47:27,030
I'm on point if you need heals.

13970
11:47:28,630 --> 11:47:29,170
Yeah, I do.

13971
11:47:29,770 --> 11:47:30,690
I'm not going no more.

13972
11:47:31,510 --> 11:47:31,910
Three.

13973
11:47:32,410 --> 11:47:32,810
Two.

13974
11:47:33,570 --> 11:47:33,970
One.

13975
11:47:34,210 --> 11:47:35,290
I might die from...

13976
11:47:35,290 --> 11:47:35,930
I froze Sorrel.

13977
11:47:36,030 --> 11:47:36,690
I froze Sorrel.

13978
11:47:37,830 --> 11:47:38,410
Penny one.

13979
11:47:38,530 --> 11:47:38,810
Penny one.

13980
11:47:38,890 --> 11:47:39,150
Penny one.

13981
11:47:39,930 --> 11:47:40,390
We got Luna.

13982
11:47:40,870 --> 11:47:41,510
I have to reload.

13983
11:47:43,530 --> 11:47:44,190
I don't know how.

13984
11:47:44,970 --> 11:47:46,150
I might be dead though.

13985
11:47:48,470 --> 11:47:48,870
Why?

13986
11:47:57,490 --> 11:47:59,670
Why did you wake him up?

13987
11:48:03,850 --> 11:48:04,250
Don't.

13988
11:48:04,250 --> 11:48:04,690
Don't use.

13989
11:48:04,990 --> 11:48:05,710
Yeah, don't use.

13990
11:48:05,810 --> 11:48:05,990
It's fine.

13991
11:48:06,030 --> 11:48:06,410
You used a lot.

13992
11:48:07,590 --> 11:48:07,890
It's good.

13993
11:48:07,970 --> 11:48:08,070
It's good.

13994
11:48:08,150 --> 11:48:08,290
It's good.

13995
11:48:08,810 --> 11:48:09,770
Lock in for next round.

13996
11:48:09,790 --> 11:48:10,150
Next round.

13997
11:48:10,230 --> 11:48:10,590
Next round.

13998
11:48:13,050 --> 11:48:13,450
Okay.

13999
11:48:13,450 --> 11:48:13,850
Okay.

14000
11:48:13,850 --> 11:48:14,690
Lock in time.

14001
11:48:15,290 --> 11:48:17,070
It's another day of locking in.

14002
11:48:17,990 --> 11:48:19,650
I need no more players.

14003
11:48:19,650 --> 11:48:24,150
I get you're mad at Raccoons but do not eat the babies.

14004
11:48:24,470 --> 11:48:26,210
But maybe I am the more player we need.

14005
11:48:27,290 --> 11:48:28,430
You're like, you're right.

14006
11:48:28,490 --> 11:48:29,390
We eat the mothers.

14007
11:48:29,410 --> 11:48:30,210
What if I blip out the mothers?

14008
11:48:37,510 --> 11:48:38,250
Fuck man.

14009
11:48:38,550 --> 11:48:40,330
30 seconds before you attack.

14010
11:48:40,650 --> 11:48:41,070
Get ready.

14011
11:48:41,250 --> 11:48:41,250
Listen.

14012
11:48:42,150 --> 11:48:45,030
You don't believe but maybe this is the play.

14013
11:48:45,130 --> 11:48:46,890
Asgard is not our concern.

14014
11:48:46,970 --> 11:48:47,550
What's the play?

14015
11:48:47,650 --> 11:48:49,190
We should be fighting on Earth.

14016
11:48:49,190 --> 11:48:52,030
Every battle against doom matters.

14017
11:48:52,690 --> 11:48:56,110
You'll find that out when Krakoa gets to this timeline.

14018
11:48:56,230 --> 11:48:56,870
What's the play?

14019
11:48:57,010 --> 11:48:57,950
We just need to go home to back.

14020
11:48:58,030 --> 11:48:59,050
They can't shoot no damage.

14021
11:48:59,450 --> 11:49:00,250
They just have to die.

14022
11:49:02,510 --> 11:49:03,790
Oh, this is a good day for Asgard.

14023
11:49:04,490 --> 11:49:05,630
They know we die at some point.

14024
11:49:05,770 --> 11:49:08,030
3, 2, 1.

14025
11:49:09,350 --> 11:49:10,450
All you need to do is capture this area.

14026
11:49:10,450 --> 11:49:12,050
I have 100 ping hope?

14027
11:49:14,410 --> 11:49:15,210
100 ping?

14028
11:49:15,230 --> 11:49:16,250
100 ping is nothing, buddy.

14029
11:49:16,710 --> 11:49:17,110
Wow.

14030
11:49:20,750 --> 11:49:23,790
That's so much.

14031
11:49:24,290 --> 11:49:24,630
Wow.

14032
11:49:27,550 --> 11:49:28,530
Door's high.

14033
11:49:28,870 --> 11:49:29,510
Door's so low.

14034
11:49:31,750 --> 11:49:33,590
Oh, I'm down.

14035
11:49:35,270 --> 11:49:36,950
And the moor got me.

14036
11:49:37,890 --> 11:49:40,910
Oh, that's awkward.

14037
11:49:41,510 --> 11:49:43,050
That's so awkward.

14038
11:49:43,050 --> 11:49:45,910
I'll use ultimates, I think.

14039
11:49:50,380 --> 11:49:52,320
Why didn't we ban Haka?

14040
11:49:52,700 --> 11:49:54,080
I'd rather fight.

14041
11:49:54,460 --> 11:49:55,540
I'd rather fight.

14042
11:49:56,640 --> 11:49:58,720
Why did we not learn?

14043
11:49:59,320 --> 11:50:00,960
Why didn't we learn?

14044
11:50:03,820 --> 11:50:05,340
Why didn't we learn?

14045
11:50:07,400 --> 11:50:09,300
I thought we learned!

14046
11:50:12,040 --> 11:50:14,520
After this, I'm always banning Haka.

14047
11:50:14,720 --> 11:50:15,180
I can't.

14048
11:50:15,820 --> 11:50:18,770
I'm gonna fucking... I can't, I've had it.

14049
11:50:23,620 --> 11:50:24,780
Is that big?

14050
11:50:25,580 --> 11:50:26,340
I can't even tell.

14051
11:50:34,000 --> 11:50:35,200
No, I'm not ulting.

14052
11:50:37,680 --> 11:50:39,400
Oh, you're so fucking dead.

14053
11:50:43,540 --> 11:50:47,780
I said it last time, but I thought we were gonna ban Hawkeye, but we never did.

14054
11:50:48,860 --> 11:50:49,380
I...

14055
11:50:49,380 --> 11:50:55,580
Oh my god, I said it last time, but I didn't think we would make the same mistake again.

14056
11:50:55,740 --> 11:50:56,060
God.

14057
11:50:59,800 --> 11:51:05,020
I can't believe we made the same mistake on the same day.

14058
11:51:10,050 --> 11:51:14,590
Oh my god, he's ready to put on a show.

14059
11:51:15,390 --> 11:51:16,630
You might just ult first if you have it.

14060
11:51:16,650 --> 11:51:17,170
Oh, never mind.

14061
11:51:21,490 --> 11:51:22,050
Nice pick.

14062
11:51:22,110 --> 11:51:22,910
I'll ult this.

14063
11:51:23,070 --> 11:51:24,490
I am ready to put on a show!

14064
11:51:24,910 --> 11:51:26,870
Support, support, support, support, support.

14065
11:51:28,050 --> 11:51:28,790
Oh my god.

14066
11:51:28,990 --> 11:51:30,570
No one, no one, no one, no one, no one.

14067
11:51:30,570 --> 11:51:31,570
Five seconds.

14068
11:51:33,390 --> 11:51:34,450
Two, whoa.

14069
11:51:35,790 --> 11:51:37,230
I have a Thor on me.

14070
11:51:39,150 --> 11:51:39,610
Guys.

14071
11:51:41,230 --> 11:51:42,650
Guys, I can't.

14072
11:51:48,460 --> 11:51:50,090
I love Purgatory.

14073
11:51:50,790 --> 11:51:52,750
I love Purgatory.

14074
11:51:53,370 --> 11:51:54,900
I love Purgatory.

14075
11:51:56,370 --> 11:51:57,050
Curse you, Hawkeye.

14076
11:51:58,830 --> 11:51:59,250
Yeah.

14077
11:52:00,230 --> 11:52:01,510
Curse you.

14078
11:52:01,750 --> 11:52:03,750
I mean, he doesn't even have that many kills.

14079
11:52:04,050 --> 11:52:05,830
The more is 31 and 2.

14080
11:52:06,630 --> 11:52:07,010
Yeah, well.

14081
11:52:07,630 --> 11:52:09,970
Oh my god, they're in the moor.

14082
11:52:09,970 --> 11:52:12,270
Never mind, it's in the moor.

14083
11:52:12,910 --> 11:52:17,810
He has so much damage on me.

14084
11:52:20,940 --> 11:52:21,380
They're in the moor.

14085
11:52:21,380 --> 11:52:22,060
They're in the moor.

14086
11:52:22,120 --> 11:52:23,160
Hard carry that.

14087
11:52:26,120 --> 11:52:28,140
Evil lurk is looking for a sub.

14088
11:52:28,220 --> 11:52:29,600
Can't scrim against one.

14089
11:52:30,360 --> 11:52:32,320
Are we looking for scrim partners?

14090
11:52:36,160 --> 11:52:38,040
This is why I ban Hawkeye.

14091
11:52:38,900 --> 11:52:40,660
I'm banning Hawkeye first no matter what.

14092
11:52:40,660 --> 11:52:42,400
I don't fucking care what my teammate says.

14093
11:52:42,540 --> 11:52:43,120
I don't.

14094
11:52:43,220 --> 11:52:45,140
I don't care.

14095
11:52:45,580 --> 11:52:48,340
I'm gonna fucking ban Hawkeye.

14096
11:52:48,920 --> 11:52:50,780
He's not even a person.

14097
11:52:50,960 --> 11:52:51,440
I mean, he is.

14098
11:52:51,760 --> 11:52:52,920
He's just a person.

14099
11:52:53,440 --> 11:52:55,320
How could he do all of this?

14100
11:52:56,860 --> 11:52:57,980
He's partially.

14101
11:52:58,620 --> 11:53:02,400
He's like not even like any mutant or anything.

14102
11:53:02,540 --> 11:53:03,860
He just has a bow.

14103
11:53:05,340 --> 11:53:05,760
He's got.

14104
11:53:05,940 --> 11:53:07,920
He should eventually run out of arrows.

14105
11:53:07,920 --> 11:53:09,220
This is not accurate.

14106
11:53:10,780 --> 11:53:11,880
He's just.

14107
11:53:12,000 --> 11:53:13,720
He's just a human.

14108
11:53:14,200 --> 11:53:15,360
He's a man.

14109
11:53:15,740 --> 11:53:18,220
How does he not run out of arrows?

14110
11:53:26,190 --> 11:53:30,610
He literally works 9 to 5 at the Avengers headquarters.

14111
11:53:32,610 --> 11:53:36,010
He has tech for 29.9.

14112
11:53:38,010 --> 11:53:39,990
Oh, I'm lobby leader?

14113
11:53:39,990 --> 11:53:40,970
Here you go.

14114
11:53:41,030 --> 11:53:41,750
I didn't even realize.

14115
11:53:42,350 --> 11:53:43,390
Oh, he's out?

14116
11:53:44,770 --> 11:53:45,510
GG's.

14117
11:53:46,030 --> 11:53:46,870
I didn't even realize.

14118
11:53:47,090 --> 11:53:49,050
This is our winning streak.

14119
11:53:49,890 --> 11:53:51,910
I didn't even realize he left.

14120
11:53:54,630 --> 11:53:55,790
Hang on.

14121
11:53:55,950 --> 11:53:56,910
I'm just saying.

14122
11:53:57,650 --> 11:53:59,330
I'm just saying.

14123
11:53:59,810 --> 11:54:00,510
He just.

14124
11:54:00,890 --> 11:54:03,530
There has to be limited ammo.

14125
11:54:04,810 --> 11:54:06,010
Oh, good luck.

14126
11:54:06,110 --> 11:54:08,130
Good luck on your tournament.

14127
11:54:09,190 --> 11:54:11,810
I hope you're super warmed up now.

14128
11:54:13,270 --> 11:54:17,990
I hope now you're like mega ultra warmed up.

14129
11:54:25,520 --> 11:54:27,300
Oh, GG's man.

14130
11:54:29,420 --> 11:54:30,020
GG's.

14131
11:54:30,220 --> 11:54:31,060
Guys, no.

14132
11:54:31,460 --> 11:54:33,540
Cut off 150, guys.

14133
11:54:33,700 --> 11:54:35,700
We can make it to 150.

14134
11:54:37,000 --> 11:54:40,100
And then we'll do it all over again today.

14135
11:54:40,660 --> 11:54:45,160
I was going to say tomorrow and I was like, oh no, it's later today.

14136
11:54:46,300 --> 11:54:47,900
How much it increased?

14137
11:54:48,760 --> 11:54:52,040
Under 74, it increased like 3 points.

14138
11:54:54,640 --> 11:54:57,160
I don't even think 250 is going to be the cut off.

14139
11:54:58,020 --> 11:54:58,580
Guys.

14140
11:55:00,380 --> 11:55:02,640
I don't think 250 is it.

14141
11:55:05,060 --> 11:55:07,700
Guys, it's going so fast.

14142
11:55:07,920 --> 11:55:10,740
It's actually going so fast.

14143
11:55:12,960 --> 11:55:13,980
Oh, and Max.

14144
11:55:14,200 --> 11:55:15,460
I wonder who he's playing with.

14145
11:55:16,340 --> 11:55:18,620
At least he's stuck in purgatory with me.

14146
11:55:19,540 --> 11:55:21,040
That makes me happy.

14147
11:55:21,620 --> 11:55:25,400
Knowing that he's also fucking going through it with me.

14148
11:55:40,750 --> 11:55:42,030
Oh my god.

14149
11:55:42,030 --> 11:55:42,090
Okay.

14150
11:55:44,310 --> 11:55:45,710
I don't know how I'm...

14151
11:55:47,930 --> 11:55:49,750
Guys, I just need 2 wins.

14152
11:55:50,490 --> 11:55:51,550
Just 2 wins.

14153
11:55:52,550 --> 11:55:53,370
No, it's 3.

14154
11:55:53,550 --> 11:55:55,650
Oh my god, why am I always stuck in 2 to 3?

14155
11:55:56,130 --> 11:55:57,490
Why am I always...

14156
11:55:57,490 --> 11:55:59,090
Why am I stuck in this...

14157
11:55:59,090 --> 11:56:01,090
Oh my god, this is purgatory.

14158
11:56:01,550 --> 11:56:04,170
I'm always 2 to 3 wins away.

14159
11:56:04,410 --> 11:56:08,230
I'm just always 2 to 3 wins away.

14160
11:56:08,830 --> 11:56:11,110
This is actual purgatory.

14161
11:56:13,250 --> 11:56:15,410
It never changes.

14162
11:56:16,970 --> 11:56:20,790
I had such high hopes because we were winning so much in the beginning.

14163
11:56:21,030 --> 11:56:23,130
I was like, look at us go.

14164
11:56:23,910 --> 11:56:25,350
Thank you for the 5 gifts.

14165
11:56:25,350 --> 11:56:27,770
I was like, this looks so easy.

14166
11:56:27,950 --> 11:56:29,830
Surely we can...

14167
11:56:29,830 --> 11:56:31,370
Surely it won't be that bad.

14168
11:56:31,670 --> 11:56:33,670
Yeah, let's check on...

14169
11:56:35,250 --> 11:56:36,550
Let's check on our boy.

14170
11:56:37,070 --> 11:56:37,790
What's his name?

14171
11:56:37,790 --> 11:56:38,830
I don't remember his name.

14172
11:56:39,690 --> 11:56:40,550
What was it?

14173
11:56:41,030 --> 11:56:42,250
The raccoon guy?

14174
11:56:44,290 --> 11:56:45,950
What was his name?

14175
11:56:47,190 --> 11:56:48,310
Oh, Power of Love.

14176
11:56:52,060 --> 11:56:52,620
How?

14177
11:57:12,840 --> 11:57:14,600
Oh shit, we have the widow.

14178
11:57:22,550 --> 11:57:23,910
Join us.

14179
11:57:24,190 --> 11:57:28,650
You know you want to be a raccoon man.

14180
11:57:29,130 --> 11:57:30,010
Bro, okay.

14181
11:57:31,790 --> 11:57:34,570
I don't understand raccoon one tricks.

14182
11:57:34,750 --> 11:57:36,370
I don't understand you guys.

14183
11:57:37,670 --> 11:57:39,870
It's like you're willing to take all the abuse.

14184
11:57:42,630 --> 11:57:44,070
Oh, we have...

14185
11:57:44,810 --> 11:57:46,030
Alright, it's time.

14186
11:57:47,070 --> 11:57:48,730
It's fucking time.

14187
11:57:48,730 --> 11:57:48,930
Oh man.

14188
11:57:52,410 --> 11:57:53,890
I don't care.

14189
11:57:55,030 --> 11:57:57,570
I don't care what all of you say.

14190
11:57:58,010 --> 11:57:59,830
I fucking... I've had enough.

14191
11:58:00,170 --> 11:58:03,550
I've had enough with Hawkeye.

14192
11:58:04,130 --> 11:58:06,290
I can't...

14193
11:58:11,520 --> 11:58:12,220
I...

14194
11:58:14,980 --> 11:58:17,920
Nobody ever listens to me.

14195
11:58:18,510 --> 11:58:21,460
Nobody ever listens to me.

14196
11:58:28,470 --> 11:58:29,910
Thank you.

14197
11:58:30,030 --> 11:58:30,650
Thank you.

14198
11:58:30,710 --> 11:58:30,930
Thank you.

14199
11:58:30,930 --> 11:58:31,010
Thank you.

14200
11:58:31,450 --> 11:58:33,150
I'm not going raccoon.

14201
11:58:33,330 --> 11:58:38,290
I still have some integrity left in this fucking...

14202
11:58:39,230 --> 11:58:40,670
Alright, call it.

14203
11:58:48,590 --> 11:58:50,050
I still have...

14204
11:58:50,050 --> 11:58:53,090
I still have some integrity in me.

14205
11:58:53,570 --> 11:58:55,810
I still...

14206
11:58:55,810 --> 11:58:58,330
I have not fallen that deep yet.

14207
11:58:58,630 --> 11:59:01,230
I have not fallen that deep yet.

14208
11:59:13,440 --> 11:59:13,900
Come on.

14209
11:59:14,060 --> 11:59:14,740
150.

14210
11:59:18,080 --> 11:59:18,420
150.

14211
11:59:19,880 --> 11:59:21,240
Come on.

14212
11:59:21,400 --> 11:59:22,700
Give me 150.

14213
11:59:27,240 --> 11:59:28,940
It can't be that difficult.

14214
11:59:28,940 --> 11:59:29,700
150?

14215
11:59:31,040 --> 11:59:31,800
Surely not.

14216
11:59:37,300 --> 11:59:39,760
Surely it can't be that difficult.

14217
11:59:40,900 --> 11:59:41,300
Right?

14218
11:59:42,920 --> 11:59:44,620
Surely it'll be okay.

14219
11:59:45,920 --> 11:59:46,320
Right?

14220
11:59:49,980 --> 11:59:53,440
We rest when we're at... Guys, I'm already settled, guys.

14221
11:59:53,520 --> 11:59:54,860
I can't go any lower.

14222
11:59:55,420 --> 11:59:56,780
I've already...

14223
11:59:56,780 --> 11:59:59,220
I've fucking settled, guys.

14224
11:59:59,320 --> 12:00:00,340
I can't...

14225
12:00:00,340 --> 12:00:02,440
Ogre, we're TPing.

14226
12:00:04,120 --> 12:00:04,660
Listen, bro.

14227
12:00:05,040 --> 12:00:05,880
I'm two steps ahead.

14228
12:00:09,480 --> 12:00:10,820
I don't think he would.

14229
12:00:20,520 --> 12:00:22,700
That's not who I wanted to damage boost.

14230
12:00:23,260 --> 12:00:24,340
Black Panther on us?

14231
12:00:29,040 --> 12:00:29,520
Sure.

14232
12:00:29,520 --> 12:00:29,620
Sure.

14233
12:00:31,320 --> 12:00:32,480
Oh my god.

14234
12:00:35,080 --> 12:00:36,760
I'm a little scared.

14235
12:00:39,340 --> 12:00:42,600
I don't have enough fucking heals for this.

14236
12:00:44,680 --> 12:00:46,960
I don't have enough heals!

14237
12:00:53,130 --> 12:00:54,330
Oh my god.

14238
12:00:54,490 --> 12:00:54,910
Please.

14239
12:00:55,230 --> 12:00:56,010
Wait up!

14240
12:00:56,190 --> 12:00:56,890
Do something!

14241
12:01:03,060 --> 12:01:04,700
Jesus Christ.

14242
12:01:11,670 --> 12:01:13,190
Oh, I can't help you.

14243
12:01:15,710 --> 12:01:17,890
I'm just... I have to just right click.

14244
12:01:19,770 --> 12:01:20,590
I have ult here.

14245
12:01:20,710 --> 12:01:21,210
I'm ulting.

14246
12:01:29,350 --> 12:01:30,410
I'm on Strange.

14247
12:01:32,090 --> 12:01:33,490
Oh, Magneto's on me though.

14248
12:01:33,490 --> 12:01:34,250
Ugh.

14249
12:01:43,030 --> 12:01:44,130
Black Panther's low.

14250
12:01:45,830 --> 12:01:46,730
Black Panther's asleep.

14251
12:01:46,850 --> 12:01:47,250
Black Panther's asleep.

14252
12:01:48,370 --> 12:01:49,370
I got him.

14253
12:01:49,450 --> 12:01:49,730
I got him.

14254
12:01:54,190 --> 12:01:55,230
Oh my god.

14255
12:01:55,250 --> 12:01:57,570
I'm fucking walking in the walls right now.

14256
12:01:58,870 --> 12:01:59,110
Magneto!

14257
12:01:59,190 --> 12:01:59,410
Magneto!

14258
12:01:59,570 --> 12:01:59,730
Magneto!

14259
12:02:04,360 --> 12:02:05,140
I sleeped him.

14260
12:02:05,240 --> 12:02:05,620
I slept him.

14261
12:02:15,440 --> 12:02:16,600
Oh my god.

14262
12:02:16,760 --> 12:02:17,340
Please!

14263
12:02:24,820 --> 12:02:26,260
I have Strange on me.

14264
12:02:29,000 --> 12:02:30,260
Strange is still on me.

14265
12:02:30,560 --> 12:02:30,820
Strange is one!

14266
12:02:30,900 --> 12:02:31,440
Strange is one!

14267
12:02:34,320 --> 12:02:35,420
Oh my god.

14268
12:02:35,440 --> 12:02:35,940
Please!

14269
12:02:41,900 --> 12:02:45,740
Why is nobody killing the healers?!

14270
12:02:50,990 --> 12:02:52,410
Guys, I don't...

14271
12:02:58,130 --> 12:02:59,270
Me and you, Strange.

14272
12:02:59,370 --> 12:02:59,690
Me and you.

14273
12:02:59,750 --> 12:03:03,970
I'm going for Adam.

14274
12:03:04,090 --> 12:03:04,570
I'm going for Adam.

14275
12:03:08,410 --> 12:03:09,810
Oh my god.

14276
12:03:11,710 --> 12:03:13,450
Oh my god!

14277
12:03:19,870 --> 12:03:20,870
Wait up, please!

14278
12:03:20,870 --> 12:03:22,270
I will fucking...

14279
12:03:28,370 --> 12:03:30,610
I have a Black Panther on me.

14280
12:03:32,170 --> 12:03:35,110
I had to save the stupid Widow!

14281
12:03:35,810 --> 12:03:37,150
It wasn't worth it!

14282
12:03:37,210 --> 12:03:38,150
I'm gonna let the Widow die.

14283
12:03:39,270 --> 12:03:41,170
I'm just gonna let this Widow die.

14284
12:03:41,290 --> 12:03:41,970
I can't.

14285
12:03:42,430 --> 12:03:43,210
I can't.

14286
12:03:43,270 --> 12:03:44,890
This Widow...

14287
12:03:44,890 --> 12:03:46,570
I'm just gonna let her fucking die.

14288
12:03:46,990 --> 12:03:47,970
It was not worth it.

14289
12:03:47,970 --> 12:03:50,170
It was not worth it.

14290
12:03:51,470 --> 12:03:52,150
100%.

14291
12:03:52,930 --> 12:03:55,390
I'm gonna fucking leave her to die.

14292
12:03:58,980 --> 12:03:59,660
Yo.

14293
12:04:01,520 --> 12:04:02,200
Bucky.

14294
12:04:04,500 --> 12:04:06,000
Maybe we go to the support?

14295
12:04:12,070 --> 12:04:14,930
I don't think this Bucky plays DPS.

14296
12:04:16,830 --> 12:04:17,570
I don't...

14297
12:04:17,570 --> 12:04:19,030
Or if you play Wolverine.

14298
12:04:19,030 --> 12:04:20,290
That's also a really good thing.

14299
12:04:20,410 --> 12:04:21,430
Have you ever played Wolverine, Bucky?

14300
12:04:25,210 --> 12:04:28,350
I don't think he cares.

14301
12:04:28,550 --> 12:04:30,970
He's gonna remember you forever.

14302
12:04:32,510 --> 12:04:33,550
I'm gonna...

14303
12:04:33,550 --> 12:04:36,730
6,000 people will now know you're...

14304
12:04:40,110 --> 12:04:43,710
6,000 people will now know who you are.

14305
12:04:49,030 --> 12:04:54,250
XD We all know now.

14306
12:04:54,630 --> 12:04:55,710
We all...

14307
12:04:55,710 --> 12:04:56,670
XD

14308
12:04:59,870 --> 12:05:02,330
We all know now.

14309
12:05:03,170 --> 12:05:04,590
Oh my god.

14310
12:05:04,710 --> 12:05:05,410
That's weird.

14311
12:05:06,870 --> 12:05:09,530
Give me one more chance.

14312
12:05:10,650 --> 12:05:11,670
No, it's over.

14313
12:05:17,560 --> 12:05:21,320
XD Why did he just...

14314
12:05:22,160 --> 12:05:22,420
What?

14315
12:05:22,840 --> 12:05:23,200
What?

14316
12:05:23,420 --> 12:05:26,760
What are you doing?

14317
12:05:28,620 --> 12:05:28,900
What?

14318
12:05:29,520 --> 12:05:30,900
Did he go back?

14319
12:05:32,990 --> 12:05:35,200
Oh my god.

14320
12:05:39,320 --> 12:05:41,000
That's fucking right.

14321
12:05:41,000 --> 12:05:44,140
Know your place.

14322
12:05:44,580 --> 12:05:46,180
Oh my god.

14323
12:05:46,220 --> 12:05:47,960
Thank fucking god.

14324
12:05:48,540 --> 12:05:50,480
Thank god.

14325
12:05:58,140 --> 12:05:59,820
Things will be okay.

14326
12:06:00,900 --> 12:06:02,800
Things will be okay, guys.

14327
12:06:07,170 --> 12:06:08,070
Things...

14328
12:06:08,070 --> 12:06:10,190
Things will be okay.

14329
12:06:10,710 --> 12:06:12,250
I can feel it.

14330
12:06:13,710 --> 12:06:14,770
I slept him.

14331
12:06:17,990 --> 12:06:18,810
He's won.

14332
12:06:24,050 --> 12:06:24,390
Alright.

14333
12:06:27,070 --> 12:06:27,670
I'm asleep.

14334
12:06:34,680 --> 12:06:36,680
How did we... Why did we let him do that?

14335
12:06:37,020 --> 12:06:38,000
Why did... Okay.

14336
12:06:38,580 --> 12:06:39,180
Okay.

14337
12:06:40,480 --> 12:06:42,220
I slept Mangito.

14338
12:06:42,220 --> 12:06:42,280
I slept Mangito.

14339
12:06:44,840 --> 12:06:45,620
Luna half.

14340
12:06:45,800 --> 12:06:46,180
Luna half.

14341
12:06:49,690 --> 12:06:52,210
I'm on Mangito.

14342
12:06:55,820 --> 12:06:56,780
Oh, Man is one.

14343
12:06:56,880 --> 12:06:57,420
Man is one.

14344
12:07:03,300 --> 12:07:04,540
Black panther on me.

14345
12:07:08,280 --> 12:07:09,320
Black panther one.

14346
12:07:11,340 --> 12:07:12,140
Good job.

14347
12:07:12,300 --> 12:07:13,700
You're fighting for your life here.

14348
12:07:13,700 --> 12:07:15,760
I can feel it.

14349
12:07:15,780 --> 12:07:17,340
You're fighting for your life here.

14350
12:07:17,680 --> 12:07:20,260
I just want to get this over.

14351
12:07:21,900 --> 12:07:23,040
I can hear your voice.

14352
12:07:23,760 --> 12:07:25,460
You're like a breakdown client.

14353
12:07:25,760 --> 12:07:28,180
I hate this black panther.

14354
12:07:33,360 --> 12:07:35,020
Oh my god.

14355
12:07:35,200 --> 12:07:36,600
Get me out of here.

14356
12:07:37,520 --> 12:07:39,700
Bro, I'm fucking gonna die.

14357
12:07:40,760 --> 12:07:41,620
I'm okay.

14358
12:07:50,600 --> 12:07:52,000
Oh my god.

14359
12:07:52,180 --> 12:07:53,820
Oh my god.

14360
12:07:53,820 --> 12:07:54,760
We have a lot of...

14361
12:07:54,760 --> 12:07:55,760
We used a lot of ults there.

14362
12:07:56,760 --> 12:07:57,720
Change one.

14363
12:07:57,980 --> 12:07:58,200
Change one.

14364
12:07:59,480 --> 12:07:59,600
Yeah.

14365
12:08:00,000 --> 12:08:00,000
Yeah.

14366
12:08:00,080 --> 12:08:00,080
Yeah.

14367
12:08:07,100 --> 12:08:08,860
I have a black panther on me.

14368
12:08:10,600 --> 12:08:11,220
He's asleep.

14369
12:08:11,300 --> 12:08:11,560
He's asleep.

14370
12:08:12,360 --> 12:08:13,280
You're so good.

14371
12:08:13,340 --> 12:08:13,900
You're so good.

14372
12:08:13,940 --> 12:08:14,540
You're so good.

14373
12:08:14,540 --> 12:08:15,680
Oh my god.

14374
12:08:15,900 --> 12:08:17,420
Get him out of here.

14375
12:08:17,420 --> 12:08:18,240
You can win this, Donkey.

14376
12:08:19,300 --> 12:08:20,140
Don't give up.

14377
12:08:20,340 --> 12:08:21,940
I'm not giving up.

14378
12:08:22,440 --> 12:08:24,700
We're the only ones that are talking.

14379
12:08:25,520 --> 12:08:26,300
It's okay.

14380
12:08:26,460 --> 12:08:27,400
That's all we need.

14381
12:08:36,980 --> 12:08:38,540
I have to ult for you.

14382
12:08:38,540 --> 12:08:40,500
I am ready to put on a show.

14383
12:08:40,520 --> 12:08:40,600
Yeah.

14384
12:08:40,760 --> 12:08:40,940
Chill.

14385
12:08:41,220 --> 12:08:41,220
Chill.

14386
12:08:41,260 --> 12:08:41,400
Chill.

14387
12:08:41,500 --> 12:08:41,620
Chill.

14388
12:08:41,720 --> 12:08:42,180
Strange, bro.

14389
12:08:42,240 --> 12:08:42,700
Strange, bro.

14390
12:08:42,800 --> 12:08:46,800
Bro, where are we going?

14391
12:08:55,460 --> 12:08:56,360
Luna's so low.

14392
12:08:57,340 --> 12:08:57,980
I'm dead.

14393
12:08:58,960 --> 12:09:00,100
We can TP, maybe?

14394
12:09:02,040 --> 12:09:02,840
I don't...

14395
12:09:02,840 --> 12:09:04,680
I don't...

14396
12:09:04,680 --> 12:09:05,060
Oh.

14397
12:09:06,780 --> 12:09:08,340
I'm cocooning.

14398
12:09:12,240 --> 12:09:13,680
Oh my god.

14399
12:09:18,450 --> 12:09:20,010
I don't...

14400
12:09:20,010 --> 12:09:21,630
I don't know.

14401
12:09:22,550 --> 12:09:24,770
I don't...

14402
12:09:24,770 --> 12:09:26,710
That's a huge ult, but...

14403
12:09:26,710 --> 12:09:27,870
He's by himself.

14404
12:09:28,990 --> 12:09:30,170
Oh my god.

14405
12:09:31,730 --> 12:09:32,710
We need to touch.

14406
12:09:32,890 --> 12:09:33,450
If we can.

14407
12:09:33,450 --> 12:09:34,850
I'm running.

14408
12:09:47,330 --> 12:09:48,950
Why did he...

14409
12:09:48,950 --> 12:09:51,050
Why did he push up?

14410
12:09:51,230 --> 12:09:53,330
Why did he push up?

14411
12:09:54,010 --> 12:09:55,740
What the fuck?

14412
12:10:00,130 --> 12:10:02,670
Why did he push up?

14413
12:10:02,730 --> 12:10:04,370
No, our Strange threw.

14414
12:10:04,370 --> 12:10:06,590
Our Strange was like...

14415
12:10:06,590 --> 12:10:07,230
Okay, also...

14416
12:10:07,910 --> 12:10:10,130
Also, fucking Bucky was like...

14417
12:10:10,130 --> 12:10:10,490
Believe.

14418
12:10:10,870 --> 12:10:12,590
Give me one more chance.

14419
12:10:13,010 --> 12:10:13,650
And I was like...

14420
12:10:13,650 --> 12:10:14,610
Bucky, please.

14421
12:10:16,110 --> 12:10:17,730
Bucky, please.

14422
12:10:19,470 --> 12:10:20,830
Holy shit.

14423
12:10:22,790 --> 12:10:23,830
I'm just like...

14424
12:10:23,830 --> 12:10:25,290
What do you want from me?

14425
12:10:26,790 --> 12:10:28,210
Oh my god.

14426
12:10:28,310 --> 12:10:30,230
My entire life is just...

14427
12:10:30,230 --> 12:10:31,070
Marble Rivals.

14428
12:10:31,070 --> 12:10:32,170
Marble Rivals.

14429
12:10:32,890 --> 12:10:33,890
I cannot...

14430
12:10:33,890 --> 12:10:35,550
Guys, I will not settle.

14431
12:10:36,330 --> 12:10:38,950
I already settled at 150.

14432
12:10:40,770 --> 12:10:43,330
We can't settle more.

14433
12:10:44,770 --> 12:10:45,770
Settle again.

14434
12:10:46,650 --> 12:10:48,930
We promised 150.

14435
12:10:49,730 --> 12:10:51,450
We will get 150.

14436
12:10:53,510 --> 12:10:55,090
Unless Booger fucking leaves me.

14437
12:10:55,170 --> 12:10:55,730
I don't know.

14438
12:10:56,890 --> 12:10:59,130
Then maybe we settle.

14439
12:11:01,550 --> 12:11:02,230
Hahaha.

14440
12:11:04,350 --> 12:11:06,990
If he leaves, then I guess we settle.

14441
12:11:07,310 --> 12:11:07,650
I guess.

14442
12:11:08,210 --> 12:11:08,890
Hahaha.

14443
12:11:12,690 --> 12:11:14,470
Oh my god.

14444
12:11:25,150 --> 12:11:26,910
Who are these people?

14445
12:11:29,050 --> 12:11:31,730
I have no idea who they are.

14446
12:11:36,610 --> 12:11:38,310
Oh my god, he fell.

14447
12:11:38,590 --> 12:11:39,230
I'm sorry.

14448
12:11:39,230 --> 12:11:39,370
Okay.

14449
12:11:41,810 --> 12:11:44,990
Just keep a bunch of Eternity Players on standby here.

14450
12:11:45,150 --> 12:11:46,210
Like, I don't know who you are.

14451
12:11:46,250 --> 12:11:47,190
I'm just gonna...

14452
12:11:47,710 --> 12:11:48,790
You're just here.

14453
12:11:50,230 --> 12:11:51,830
You're just here.

14454
12:11:53,410 --> 12:11:53,930
Hahaha.

14455
12:12:00,410 --> 12:12:01,810
Oh my god.

14456
12:12:05,350 --> 12:12:07,390
I have no idea who some of these...

14457
12:12:07,390 --> 12:12:08,450
I have no idea.

14458
12:12:12,520 --> 12:12:14,340
I don't know who they are.

14459
12:12:14,500 --> 12:12:16,520
I'm just putting them there for standby.

14460
12:12:20,510 --> 12:12:22,090
Been through a lot, guys.

14461
12:12:22,570 --> 12:12:25,170
This has been a wild ride so far.

14462
12:12:25,750 --> 12:12:28,520
This has been like a wild fucking 12...

14463
12:12:29,030 --> 12:12:29,990
How long have I been up?

14464
12:12:30,790 --> 12:12:31,770
12 hours.

14465
12:12:31,890 --> 12:12:34,350
What's my record for the longest stream I've done?

14466
12:12:37,530 --> 12:12:38,870
Wait, he is a teammate?

14467
12:12:40,590 --> 12:12:41,270
Alright.

14468
12:12:42,170 --> 12:12:43,050
Who is he?

14469
12:12:43,970 --> 12:12:44,650
Alright.

14470
12:12:45,190 --> 12:12:46,270
He's a teammate.

14471
12:12:46,610 --> 12:12:47,390
Alright, he's in.

14472
12:12:47,990 --> 12:12:51,350
I have no idea.

14473
12:12:51,550 --> 12:12:52,310
What does he play?

14474
12:12:54,810 --> 12:12:55,490
14?

14475
12:12:56,710 --> 12:12:57,990
It's my one ping, right?

14476
12:12:58,330 --> 12:13:00,110
My one ping.

14477
12:13:03,110 --> 12:13:04,070
You're right.

14478
12:13:04,330 --> 12:13:07,090
Ever since I put one ping...

14479
12:13:07,090 --> 12:13:08,950
It's all been downhill.

14480
12:13:10,290 --> 12:13:11,410
Ever since.

14481
12:13:14,820 --> 12:13:17,500
One ping with one bar.

14482
12:13:17,580 --> 12:13:19,360
Oh no.

14483
12:13:19,680 --> 12:13:21,720
Wait, what's my...

14484
12:13:21,720 --> 12:13:23,240
What's the battery on my mouse?

14485
12:13:25,640 --> 12:13:26,200
39%.

14486
12:13:26,200 --> 12:13:27,100
We still got it.

14487
12:13:27,220 --> 12:13:27,900
It's still fine.

14488
12:13:28,320 --> 12:13:29,200
What are we waiting for?

14489
12:13:29,420 --> 12:13:30,220
Is he dodging?

14490
12:13:36,200 --> 12:13:37,700
Is he dodging right now?

14491
12:13:37,780 --> 12:13:39,300
What the fuck are we waiting for?

14492
12:13:40,640 --> 12:13:43,260
Oh, he's snacking.

14493
12:13:48,820 --> 12:13:51,380
You don't need...

14494
12:13:51,380 --> 12:13:53,280
You eat rank.

14495
12:13:53,620 --> 12:13:55,760
Rank points is our food now.

14496
12:13:57,240 --> 12:13:59,820
Our rank points is what sustained us.

14497
12:14:01,420 --> 12:14:03,600
I am not gonna embrace...

14498
12:14:03,600 --> 12:14:04,960
Guys...

14499
12:14:04,960 --> 12:14:07,300
I'll cut off my hand.

14500
12:14:09,680 --> 12:14:10,140
Haha.

14501
12:14:11,720 --> 12:14:12,500
End game.

14502
12:14:12,720 --> 12:14:13,100
Of course.

14503
12:14:13,300 --> 12:14:13,940
End game.

14504
12:14:17,230 --> 12:14:18,350
I shouldn't be that hungry.

14505
12:14:20,590 --> 12:14:22,250
I made pasta last night.

14506
12:14:22,550 --> 12:14:24,290
I made pasta, but like...

14507
12:14:24,290 --> 12:14:26,710
I really wanted... I used buldak sauce.

14508
12:14:26,830 --> 12:14:27,750
With my pasta.

14509
12:14:29,030 --> 12:14:30,590
I was like... I was tired.

14510
12:14:31,050 --> 12:14:32,250
I just wanted to try it out.

14511
12:14:32,330 --> 12:14:33,710
Because I always have it with the ramen.

14512
12:14:33,950 --> 12:14:34,630
It comes in.

14513
12:14:35,130 --> 12:14:36,110
And I was like, you know what?

14514
12:14:36,450 --> 12:14:38,670
I'm gonna mix spaghetti...

14515
12:14:38,670 --> 12:14:40,670
Spaghetti with buldak sauce.

14516
12:14:42,490 --> 12:14:43,030
Kelvin.

14517
12:14:46,250 --> 12:14:46,790
Kelvin.

14518
12:14:48,470 --> 12:14:49,550
Yeah.

14519
12:14:52,170 --> 12:14:52,730
I'm not.

14520
12:14:52,850 --> 12:14:54,570
I'm so locked in.

14521
12:14:58,250 --> 12:14:59,330
Haha.

14522
12:14:59,510 --> 12:14:59,830
Haha.

14523
12:15:08,670 --> 12:15:10,830
Wait, how long are you planning on streaming for?

14524
12:15:12,070 --> 12:15:15,230
I'm streaming until we get to our goal, Doki.

14525
12:15:19,710 --> 12:15:20,270
Guys...

14526
12:15:21,550 --> 12:15:23,130
Guys, do you think we're cooked?

14527
12:15:23,490 --> 12:15:25,190
We shall achieve greatness.

14528
12:15:29,030 --> 12:15:30,230
Oh my god.

14529
12:15:30,770 --> 12:15:31,830
Are you a quitter, DokiBird?

14530
12:15:31,930 --> 12:15:34,990
No, I'm not a quitter, but...

14531
12:15:34,990 --> 12:15:36,510
I'm a little worried.

14532
12:15:39,110 --> 12:15:40,390
What are you worried about?

14533
12:15:41,850 --> 12:15:44,170
We didn't ban Hawkeye.

14534
12:15:50,290 --> 12:15:51,330
I'm listening.

14535
12:15:51,510 --> 12:15:52,910
What is the worst thing that can happen here?

14536
12:15:56,270 --> 12:15:57,070
I don't know.

14537
12:15:57,790 --> 12:15:59,970
The Hawkeye dip like the last three times.

14538
12:16:00,090 --> 12:16:01,790
We didn't ban Hawkeye.

14539
12:16:02,290 --> 12:16:04,650
Maybe it's time for me to play Hawkeye.

14540
12:16:06,970 --> 12:16:09,650
These other players just listening to our conversation.

14541
12:16:11,730 --> 12:16:12,030
Haha.

14542
12:16:13,590 --> 12:16:17,910
These players are listening to my fucking descent into madness.

14543
12:16:18,590 --> 12:16:20,550
They're like, is she okay?

14544
12:16:21,170 --> 12:16:22,450
And I'm like...

14545
12:16:22,450 --> 12:16:23,830
I'm like...

14546
12:16:24,530 --> 12:16:24,870
Haha.

14547
12:16:25,510 --> 12:16:28,170
Did you guys lose your last game?

14548
12:16:28,590 --> 12:16:29,190
Haha.

14549
12:16:30,170 --> 12:16:33,030
No, I'm on a 10 win streak right now.

14550
12:16:34,650 --> 12:16:37,010
I'm on a 20 game winning streak, baby.

14551
12:16:37,090 --> 12:16:39,790
It ends now.

14552
12:16:43,730 --> 12:16:45,510
Everybody's against me.

14553
12:16:46,510 --> 12:16:48,270
Everybody's against me.

14554
12:16:48,370 --> 12:16:50,010
I'm gonna fucking freak out.

14555
12:16:54,090 --> 12:16:54,930
God,

14556
12:17:00,630 --> 12:17:02,790
if I could, I would fucking kick you.

14557
12:17:03,570 --> 12:17:04,570
It was strange.

14558
12:17:06,250 --> 12:17:06,910
I'm pushing up.

14559
12:17:08,390 --> 12:17:09,430
Right side no more.

14560
12:17:10,350 --> 12:17:11,210
My shield is broken.

14561
12:17:13,290 --> 12:17:14,170
Jesus Christ.

14562
12:17:14,510 --> 12:17:14,750
Okay.

14563
12:17:16,930 --> 12:17:17,690
Nice kill.

14564
12:17:18,170 --> 12:17:19,930
There's a Psylocke to the top right.

14565
12:17:20,970 --> 12:17:21,850
Or behind us.

14566
12:17:23,430 --> 12:17:24,390
She's one, she's one, she's one.

14567
12:17:24,810 --> 12:17:25,850
I think she got healed.

14568
12:17:27,130 --> 12:17:28,330
She got healed, it's fine.

14569
12:17:28,330 --> 12:17:29,170
Yeah, it's me.

14570
12:17:30,290 --> 12:17:30,990
She's on me.

14571
12:17:31,190 --> 12:17:32,570
She's high ground, I'm flying to her.

14572
12:17:35,370 --> 12:17:35,890
She's out.

14573
12:17:36,070 --> 12:17:37,150
Strange on me, shoot Strange.

14574
12:17:46,050 --> 12:17:46,810
Strange is...

14575
12:17:46,810 --> 12:17:48,010
Strange low, Strange one, Strange one.

14576
12:17:48,650 --> 12:17:49,030
Focus...

14577
12:17:49,650 --> 12:17:50,590
Focus Strange if you can.

14578
12:17:51,830 --> 12:17:52,990
Oh, I think...

14579
12:17:52,990 --> 12:17:54,430
He's still low, he's still low.

14580
12:17:54,430 --> 12:17:56,010
He's high, I got him.

14581
12:17:57,070 --> 12:17:59,270
There's still a Psylocke behind us.

14582
12:18:02,030 --> 12:18:03,490
She's walking around.

14583
12:18:08,390 --> 12:18:09,330
Nice kill.

14584
12:18:17,000 --> 12:18:18,800
That Octopus was so scary.

14585
12:18:18,960 --> 12:18:19,680
We have unlimited.

14586
12:18:20,580 --> 12:18:21,520
At him, at him, at him.

14587
12:18:22,120 --> 12:18:22,440
Strange.

14588
12:18:28,100 --> 12:18:29,340
We win.

14589
12:18:31,080 --> 12:18:32,820
Where's Rosa when we need her?

14590
12:18:37,880 --> 12:18:39,120
That guy...

14591
12:18:39,120 --> 12:18:41,380
That guy went on a fucking 10 win streak.

14592
12:18:41,580 --> 12:18:42,760
It's actually crazy.

14593
12:18:45,400 --> 12:18:46,400
That guy...

14594
12:18:46,400 --> 12:18:47,720
That guy...

14595
12:18:49,660 --> 12:18:56,060
I'm probably going to miss everyone, but...

14596
12:18:56,060 --> 12:18:57,140
Maybe I'm going to go.

14597
12:18:58,100 --> 12:18:58,580
Are you ready guys?

14598
12:18:58,780 --> 12:19:00,880
3, 2, 1, hit them all.

14599
12:19:05,520 --> 12:19:06,980
Mantis all first if we need to.

14600
12:19:07,740 --> 12:19:09,840
Yeah, I'm on Mantis.

14601
12:19:11,140 --> 12:19:11,720
Nice.

14602
12:19:13,200 --> 12:19:14,260
There's an Amorn behind us.

14603
12:19:16,540 --> 12:19:18,300
There's an Amorn right behind us guys.

14604
12:19:20,280 --> 12:19:21,780
He's still behind us.

14605
12:19:25,040 --> 12:19:27,100
We report our Strange.

14606
12:19:27,320 --> 12:19:27,900
Woah!

14607
12:19:29,060 --> 12:19:30,640
We deserve this.

14608
12:19:30,800 --> 12:19:31,560
Yeah, they say that.

14609
12:19:31,760 --> 12:19:34,760
We deserve this.

14610
12:19:35,160 --> 12:19:36,380
It's actually funny.

14611
12:19:36,800 --> 12:19:37,540
He is the ace.

14612
12:19:40,280 --> 12:19:41,820
What the fuck has he been doing?

14613
12:19:41,880 --> 12:19:42,440
I don't understand.

14614
12:19:42,560 --> 12:19:43,180
What is he doing?

14615
12:19:45,100 --> 12:19:46,560
He's playing the game.

14616
12:19:46,780 --> 12:19:48,840
I got it.

14617
12:19:53,400 --> 12:19:54,560
I'm fearing...

14618
12:19:55,720 --> 12:20:00,000
3, 2, 1.

14619
12:20:00,380 --> 12:20:00,960
I'm...

14620
12:20:00,960 --> 12:20:02,260
I froze him.

14621
12:20:04,580 --> 12:20:06,020
He's playing the game.

14622
12:20:06,180 --> 12:20:07,200
I don't know.

14623
12:20:12,040 --> 12:20:13,000
Are you okay?

14624
12:20:13,080 --> 12:20:14,220
Oh, you're not okay.

14625
12:20:14,600 --> 12:20:16,420
Yeah, I'm fine actually.

14626
12:20:16,780 --> 12:20:17,480
Are you okay?

14627
12:20:18,420 --> 12:20:19,720
I'm so okay.

14628
12:20:21,740 --> 12:20:23,920
How was your baby raccoon conversation?

14629
12:20:26,120 --> 12:20:27,880
It's because I want to eat a raccoon.

14630
12:20:28,020 --> 12:20:28,840
I'm the bad guy.

14631
12:20:28,920 --> 12:20:29,560
I don't understand.

14632
12:20:30,140 --> 12:20:31,640
Why would you want to eat a raccoon though?

14633
12:20:32,860 --> 12:20:34,180
I don't know Kelvin.

14634
12:20:34,460 --> 12:20:36,020
Why do we have Kelvin here?

14635
12:20:37,060 --> 12:20:38,060
Who is Kelvin?

14636
12:20:41,060 --> 12:20:41,780
I don't know.

14637
12:20:41,780 --> 12:20:42,640
Kelvin, bruh.

14638
12:20:46,220 --> 12:20:47,780
I don't know.

14639
12:20:48,020 --> 12:20:48,900
I knew I would.

14640
12:20:53,280 --> 12:20:55,920
I'm gonna hit a big one by the way.

14641
12:20:57,020 --> 12:21:00,000
We have a strange in front of us.

14642
12:21:02,220 --> 12:21:02,900
I'm dead.

14643
12:21:02,900 --> 12:21:03,040
I'm dead.

14644
12:21:03,440 --> 12:21:05,200
I'm dead.

14645
12:21:05,580 --> 12:21:06,980
I'm rezzing.

14646
12:21:09,260 --> 12:21:12,940
I have a magneto and strange just fucking WT me.

14647
12:21:13,020 --> 12:21:13,540
I'm coming.

14648
12:21:14,760 --> 12:21:17,160
I have to...

14649
12:21:17,160 --> 12:21:17,600
I got you.

14650
12:21:21,760 --> 12:21:23,100
Hawkeye right side.

14651
12:21:24,620 --> 12:21:26,200
No shield for strange.

14652
12:21:27,960 --> 12:21:28,540
I'm Hawkeye.

14653
12:21:30,140 --> 12:21:31,320
The red boss.

14654
12:21:31,320 --> 12:21:32,700
My shield is broke.

14655
12:21:37,160 --> 12:21:39,400
They have no mantis.

14656
12:21:46,080 --> 12:21:48,480
I couldn't get that off.

14657
12:21:51,140 --> 12:21:52,360
Oh my god.

14658
12:21:52,740 --> 12:21:56,340
I got headshot.

14659
12:21:57,480 --> 12:21:58,760
Oh my god, Hawkeye nation.

14660
12:21:58,760 --> 12:22:00,720
Guys, we need a plan against the Hawkeye nation.

14661
12:22:06,110 --> 12:22:07,570
Can we rotate right side?

14662
12:22:08,090 --> 12:22:09,450
Go right side.

14663
12:22:15,080 --> 12:22:16,760
My shield is breaking.

14664
12:22:17,040 --> 12:22:17,580
Almost broken.

14665
12:22:18,120 --> 12:22:18,860
I have no shield.

14666
12:22:21,880 --> 12:22:22,400
Strange.

14667
12:22:23,720 --> 12:22:26,500
Oh my god, I'm so locked in right now.

14668
12:22:27,100 --> 12:22:27,620
We have unlimited.

14669
12:22:27,620 --> 12:22:27,740
I'm dead.

14670
12:22:28,760 --> 12:22:30,000
My shield is breaking.

14671
12:22:30,400 --> 12:22:31,860
I'm crashing.

14672
12:22:32,420 --> 12:22:34,020
I froze magneto.

14673
12:22:39,110 --> 12:22:40,230
Hawkeye is dead.

14674
12:22:42,110 --> 12:22:42,810
I need to reload.

14675
12:22:47,150 --> 12:22:49,270
Strange is just walking up.

14676
12:22:54,690 --> 12:22:56,250
This is last fight.

14677
12:22:57,630 --> 12:22:58,390
Wait.

14678
12:23:03,450 --> 12:23:05,830
My shield is broken.

14679
12:23:05,990 --> 12:23:06,690
Hawkeye right side.

14680
12:23:07,430 --> 12:23:14,100
I have ult here.

14681
12:23:19,120 --> 12:23:20,500
I'm ulting now.

14682
12:23:30,020 --> 12:23:32,260
3, 2, 1.

14683
12:23:33,600 --> 12:23:33,840
3, 2, 1.

14684
12:23:33,840 --> 12:23:36,180
I have a...

14685
12:23:36,180 --> 12:23:37,220
I'm trying to keep you alive.

14686
12:23:37,560 --> 12:23:39,000
I'm trying my best.

14687
12:23:43,560 --> 12:23:44,660
Strange, strange, strange.

14688
12:23:44,660 --> 12:23:45,020
Strange, strange, strange.

14689
12:23:47,640 --> 12:23:49,900
Look at me, look at me.

14690
12:23:49,940 --> 12:23:50,580
Sleeping, sleeping.

14691
12:23:53,780 --> 12:23:56,120
I'm backing out if someone else stays on cart.

14692
12:23:56,440 --> 12:23:57,500
I'm going to back out so I can heal.

14693
12:23:58,180 --> 12:23:59,440
Can we just cap it?

14694
12:23:59,580 --> 12:24:00,320
Can we hold close?

14695
12:24:01,760 --> 12:24:03,440
Stay on point then.

14696
12:24:08,540 --> 12:24:10,760
We got it, we got it.

14697
12:24:10,760 --> 12:24:11,140
We have to cap.

14698
12:24:14,320 --> 12:24:16,420
There's a strange that's just walking up.

14699
12:24:27,920 --> 12:24:29,460
I can maybe touch this guy.

14700
12:24:32,040 --> 12:24:33,160
I'm about to do it right now.

14701
12:24:33,960 --> 12:24:36,200
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

14702
12:24:36,200 --> 12:24:37,120
I'm walking, I'm walking.

14703
12:24:40,760 --> 12:24:41,360
I got slept.

14704
12:24:41,820 --> 12:24:46,000
Punisher's one, Punisher's solo.

14705
12:24:46,480 --> 12:24:46,960
He's solo.

14706
12:24:49,740 --> 12:24:52,400
Yeah, I got Hawkeye'd.

14707
12:24:57,910 --> 12:25:00,110
We still have two other healers.

14708
12:25:02,670 --> 12:25:03,830
Oh, nevermind.

14709
12:25:09,610 --> 12:25:10,570
I'm 71.

14710
12:25:10,950 --> 12:25:12,170
I don't know if I can get in time though.

14711
12:25:13,590 --> 12:25:14,230
You can.

14712
12:25:15,790 --> 12:25:16,510
I have strange out.

14713
12:25:21,590 --> 12:25:23,450
Punisher left side, Hawkeye left side.

14714
12:25:24,510 --> 12:25:25,530
Go right side, go right side.

14715
12:25:25,630 --> 12:25:26,730
Just take the right side angle.

14716
12:25:30,710 --> 12:25:31,450
They're one.

14717
12:25:33,490 --> 12:25:34,590
He top me off.

14718
12:25:42,170 --> 12:25:44,170
We almost have a...

14719
12:25:45,070 --> 12:25:46,610
Oh, I'm 96.

14720
12:25:47,070 --> 12:25:47,730
I was 96.

14721
12:25:54,800 --> 12:25:57,060
I couldn't get my ult in time.

14722
12:25:59,540 --> 12:26:01,920
This is why we always bad Hawkeye.

14723
12:26:02,120 --> 12:26:02,500
This is...

14724
12:26:02,500 --> 12:26:06,140
I'd rather play against Hela than a Hawkeye.

14725
12:26:06,220 --> 12:26:10,080
I feel like you can counter Hela more easily than Hawkeye.

14726
12:26:10,520 --> 12:26:11,840
I don't understand.

14727
12:26:13,420 --> 12:26:14,800
Why is that?

14728
12:26:14,800 --> 12:26:16,080
Why do we not bad Hawkeye?

14729
12:26:23,640 --> 12:26:25,280
I couldn't farm it.

14730
12:26:25,460 --> 12:26:26,660
I told him like, I can't.

14731
12:26:26,800 --> 12:26:28,240
I need...

14732
12:26:29,500 --> 12:26:31,620
Because we had two other supports.

14733
12:26:32,160 --> 12:26:33,160
They fucking...

14734
12:26:33,160 --> 12:26:35,240
They took up all the heals.

14735
12:26:35,900 --> 12:26:36,740
I was just...

14736
12:26:36,740 --> 12:26:38,900
This is why I hate you, Calvin.

14737
12:26:38,900 --> 12:26:40,900
This is why...

14738
12:26:41,500 --> 12:26:44,500
The Raccoon just takes all the heals.

14739
12:26:45,020 --> 12:26:46,360
I can't do it.

14740
12:26:46,420 --> 12:26:47,880
Because all he does is left click.

14741
12:26:48,320 --> 12:26:50,160
And it just absorbs the heals.

14742
12:26:50,620 --> 12:26:53,340
I fucking hate you, Calvin.

14743
12:26:53,880 --> 12:26:55,240
I hope you...

14744
12:26:55,240 --> 12:26:56,400
I hope you're a roadkill.

14745
12:26:56,900 --> 12:26:58,220
I legitimately hope you're...

14746
12:26:58,220 --> 12:27:04,900
I hope Rocky Raccoon continues to get nerfed so that every time these people pick Rocky Raccoon, they will get fucking...

14747
12:27:05,680 --> 12:27:08,800
They will drop 500 points.

14748
12:27:12,680 --> 12:27:15,020
Dude, I hope...

14749
12:27:15,020 --> 12:27:20,660
I hope they never get back to this elo the moment fucking Rocky Raccoon gets nerfed.

14750
12:27:26,520 --> 12:27:29,220
Left click is so slick.

14751
12:27:43,360 --> 12:27:45,260
Don't give Hawkeye too much space.

14752
12:27:45,560 --> 12:27:46,540
Stay here.

14753
12:27:46,960 --> 12:27:48,680
They have a better frontline.

14754
12:28:03,130 --> 12:28:04,750
Oh my god.

14755
12:28:05,310 --> 12:28:07,050
There's a... I froze him.

14756
12:28:15,050 --> 12:28:16,410
Hawkeye peeking.

14757
12:28:16,590 --> 12:28:17,050
Nice kill.

14758
12:28:21,700 --> 12:28:24,140
My god, I'm fucking helping you.

14759
12:28:24,780 --> 12:28:26,120
Don't worry, my queen.

14760
12:28:30,610 --> 12:28:32,280
Don't worry, my queen.

14761
12:28:32,400 --> 12:28:34,280
I'm here to assist you.

14762
12:28:34,920 --> 12:28:36,700
Oh, I have to reload.

14763
12:28:48,940 --> 12:28:51,460
Oh, you got Hawkeye'd.

14764
12:28:54,840 --> 12:28:56,360
We have portals way slower than them, by the way.

14765
12:28:56,420 --> 12:28:57,340
Like, we have triple support.

14766
12:28:57,800 --> 12:28:59,000
We have Mantis ult.

14767
12:29:05,840 --> 12:29:06,660
Hawkeye half.

14768
12:29:06,740 --> 12:29:07,420
Hawkeye one.

14769
12:29:08,260 --> 12:29:09,460
He's so low.

14770
12:29:18,200 --> 12:29:19,160
I'm 97.

14771
12:29:19,760 --> 12:29:20,660
I have my ult.

14772
12:29:20,940 --> 12:29:21,760
But they have strange ult.

14773
12:29:23,500 --> 12:29:25,780
He died so fast.

14774
12:29:27,400 --> 12:29:29,040
They have strange ult here.

14775
12:29:30,160 --> 12:29:32,840
She's waiting for it.

14776
12:29:35,870 --> 12:29:37,510
Goodbye, me.

14777
12:29:42,970 --> 12:29:44,010
Goodbye,

14778
12:29:48,110 --> 12:29:48,270
me.

14779
12:29:49,510 --> 12:29:51,310
I say goodbye.

14780
12:29:55,170 --> 12:29:55,790
Never again.

14781
12:29:56,390 --> 12:29:59,270
Never again will I let them not ban Hawkeye.

14782
12:29:59,610 --> 12:30:03,450
I lose because we literally don't have the better Hawkeye.

14783
12:30:03,550 --> 12:30:05,230
That's actually so fucked up.

14784
12:30:05,770 --> 12:30:06,710
Like, I...

14785
12:30:06,710 --> 12:30:08,850
That's so... Every time.

14786
12:30:10,970 --> 12:30:11,890
Every time.

14787
12:30:12,030 --> 12:30:16,210
I literally lose because my team has the shittier Hawkeye.

14788
12:30:18,050 --> 12:30:20,770
I don't understand how this is possible.

14789
12:30:20,770 --> 12:30:21,550
I...

14790
12:30:22,850 --> 12:30:26,410
I need that strange player to start throwing again.

14791
12:30:27,170 --> 12:30:28,890
I got one.

14792
12:30:29,810 --> 12:30:31,130
Nice, nice.

14793
12:30:43,620 --> 12:30:46,320
Strange, strange, strange, strange.

14794
12:30:48,420 --> 12:30:49,620
Change one, change one, yeah.

14795
12:30:49,620 --> 12:30:51,040
Nice, winnable, winnable, winnable.

14796
12:30:51,880 --> 12:30:52,440
They're rezzing.

14797
12:30:53,700 --> 12:30:54,460
Right here.

14798
12:30:57,620 --> 12:30:59,160
Strange, change one, change one.

14799
12:30:59,460 --> 12:31:00,460
Strange, we got him, we got him, we got him.

14800
12:31:01,620 --> 12:31:02,780
Watch out for Hawkeye left side.

14801
12:31:09,660 --> 12:31:11,360
I'm trying my best to pick you up.

14802
12:31:20,040 --> 12:31:20,560
Woo!

14803
12:31:20,560 --> 12:31:21,660
Never miss!

14804
12:31:22,400 --> 12:31:23,080
Careful of this guy.

14805
12:31:23,960 --> 12:31:24,420
Kill him above.

14806
12:31:25,020 --> 12:31:26,240
I'm safe here.

14807
12:31:26,660 --> 12:31:30,460
I need 10% for all...

14808
12:31:30,460 --> 12:31:31,420
Coming back, coming back.

14809
12:31:32,860 --> 12:31:34,420
I have ult, I have ult.

14810
12:31:35,580 --> 12:31:37,620
I'm ulting here, I'm ulting here, I'm ulting here.

14811
12:31:41,980 --> 12:31:43,420
We're even right now.

14812
12:31:47,240 --> 12:31:48,280
I'm just...

14813
12:31:48,280 --> 12:31:50,200
We almost have Strange ult, we almost have Strange ult.

14814
12:31:51,440 --> 12:31:52,280
I got him.

14815
12:31:53,320 --> 12:31:54,200
He's huge, he's huge, he's huge.

14816
12:31:54,380 --> 12:31:55,200
Serenite cart, Serenite cart.

14817
12:31:55,740 --> 12:31:56,880
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

14818
12:31:58,900 --> 12:31:59,680
Get him, get him.

14819
12:32:08,840 --> 12:32:09,880
Oh my god.

14820
12:32:10,520 --> 12:32:11,800
Hawkeye is main.

14821
12:32:13,180 --> 12:32:14,200
I'm a little worried.

14822
12:32:24,840 --> 12:32:26,820
I don't even know if this is a good angle to play.

14823
12:32:27,000 --> 12:32:27,440
They have mech.

14824
12:32:28,860 --> 12:32:31,080
Strange has ult, he's gonna fly up and try to ult you guys there.

14825
12:32:31,080 --> 12:32:31,760
Be careful.

14826
12:32:43,460 --> 12:32:45,260
Goodbye everybody.

14827
12:32:45,720 --> 12:32:46,240
Goodbye.

14828
12:32:47,140 --> 12:32:47,740
Goodbye.

14829
12:32:50,100 --> 12:32:52,720
Guess who I'm avoiding after this game?

14830
12:33:01,520 --> 12:33:03,400
Yeah, I tried to heal you.

14831
12:33:10,780 --> 12:33:11,640
Nice.

14832
12:33:14,500 --> 12:33:15,560
I froze Magneto.

14833
12:33:29,950 --> 12:33:32,850
I froze Strange.

14834
12:33:34,770 --> 12:33:35,930
Strange has won.

14835
12:33:39,370 --> 12:33:41,090
Leave Raccoon alone.

14836
12:33:42,670 --> 12:33:43,630
I'm fucking kidding.

14837
12:33:44,150 --> 12:33:44,790
I'm fucking kidding.

14838
12:33:46,590 --> 12:33:48,510
I'm not gonna say it.

14839
12:33:49,330 --> 12:33:50,910
I hope you guys had a nice day.

14840
12:33:53,110 --> 12:33:54,690
We need to play aggro on their tanks.

14841
12:33:54,930 --> 12:33:55,690
With Wolverine.

14842
12:33:59,790 --> 12:34:14,990
I'm gonna ult in this.

14843
12:34:22,250 --> 12:34:23,610
They might have Strange ult here.

14844
12:34:23,930 --> 12:34:24,650
And Hawkeye, yep.

14845
12:34:28,070 --> 12:34:29,110
Nice, there's no more ults, no more ults.

14846
12:34:29,210 --> 12:34:30,170
We're winning this.

14847
12:34:33,170 --> 12:34:35,650
Oh my gosh, he's solo.

14848
12:34:36,810 --> 12:34:37,550
I can't get to you.

14849
12:34:43,450 --> 12:34:44,450
Nice, oh we lost.

14850
12:34:51,010 --> 12:34:51,410
Yep.

14851
12:34:55,990 --> 12:34:59,650
I'm asleep, I mean frozen.

14852
12:35:00,050 --> 12:35:00,770
I'm gonna reload.

14853
12:35:02,330 --> 12:35:03,310
Oh my gosh.

14854
12:35:04,450 --> 12:35:05,250
Here, here.

14855
12:35:06,870 --> 12:35:07,670
Here, here.

14856
12:35:08,910 --> 12:35:09,970
Oh, you got it.

14857
12:35:15,210 --> 12:35:16,850
Last fight, this last fight, this last fight.

14858
12:35:17,310 --> 12:35:18,730
Strange, Strange, Strange if we can, Strange if we can.

14859
12:35:22,090 --> 12:35:23,110
Hawkeye on me, Hawkeye.

14860
12:35:23,770 --> 12:35:24,710
What the fuck.

14861
12:35:25,090 --> 12:35:26,670
Stay with me, stay with me.

14862
12:35:26,790 --> 12:35:28,910
I'm trying, I couldn't, I had you healed.

14863
12:35:33,770 --> 12:35:35,050
We gotta keep investing.

14864
12:35:35,170 --> 12:35:35,590
I'll be there.

14865
12:35:39,970 --> 12:35:41,230
Keep stalling, please.

14866
12:35:46,270 --> 12:35:47,570
Stay put, stay put.

14867
12:35:49,890 --> 12:35:50,410
Come on.

14868
12:35:50,890 --> 12:35:52,570
I'm trying to keep our...

14869
12:36:00,150 --> 12:36:00,790
9%, 9%.

14870
12:36:04,030 --> 12:36:05,550
I got it, I got it, I just got it.

14871
12:36:07,750 --> 12:36:09,310
I see him, I see him, I see him, I see him.

14872
12:36:11,330 --> 12:36:13,190
Oh, don't get Hawkeye, don't get Hawkeye.

14873
12:36:15,430 --> 12:36:16,630
3, 2, 1.

14874
12:36:17,570 --> 12:36:18,910
I froze Magneto.

14875
12:36:21,730 --> 12:36:24,130
Where, where's behind?

14876
12:36:30,270 --> 12:36:32,670
Strange has ult, Strange has ult, we have to...

14877
12:36:35,530 --> 12:36:36,770
I got him, I got him.

14878
12:36:39,070 --> 12:36:40,790
Oh my god.

14879
12:36:40,790 --> 12:36:40,950
Oh.

14880
12:36:43,950 --> 12:36:47,970
I almost threw that entire fucking game with my shitty Wolverine ult.

14881
12:36:48,330 --> 12:36:50,790
Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking...

14882
12:36:55,990 --> 12:36:59,970
End game, end game, end game.

14883
12:37:05,970 --> 12:37:07,250
I'm pecking.

14884
12:37:12,070 --> 12:37:13,790
Oh my god.

14885
12:37:23,910 --> 12:37:27,470
Get out, get out of my life.

14886
12:37:27,890 --> 12:37:29,910
I'm gonna fucking unblock you.

14887
12:37:37,090 --> 12:37:39,710
Oh my god, oh my god.

14888
12:37:39,710 --> 12:37:41,830
Oh my god.

14889
12:37:41,830 --> 12:37:44,430
This one right here.

14890
12:37:46,300 --> 12:37:48,950
Oh my god.

14891
12:37:51,700 --> 12:37:53,290
Did she get him?

14892
12:37:53,710 --> 12:37:56,170
Oh, I'm okay.

14893
12:37:56,650 --> 12:37:58,230
I'm a good person.

14894
12:37:59,070 --> 12:38:01,030
I'm a good person.

14895
12:38:08,920 --> 12:38:11,840
Good vibes, good vibes.

14896
12:38:13,040 --> 12:38:14,260
Yippee.

14897
12:38:15,260 --> 12:38:15,860
Woo.

14898
12:38:20,380 --> 12:38:23,920
We're good vibes here, good vibes all around.

14899
12:38:24,740 --> 12:38:26,180
I love my rivals.

14900
12:38:31,090 --> 12:38:34,270
Raccoon hater in 2025.

14901
12:38:37,970 --> 12:38:40,450
I'm a hater of many things.

14902
12:38:43,430 --> 12:38:46,250
I've actually started hating more.

14903
12:38:46,550 --> 12:38:51,070
I've started hating more because of Marble Rivals.

14904
12:38:56,630 --> 12:38:59,450
I'm having a great time.

14905
12:39:00,230 --> 12:39:02,330
Thumbs up if you're having a good time.

14906
12:39:03,050 --> 12:39:06,010
And you also wanna eat a raccoon.

14907
12:39:07,030 --> 12:39:08,050
It could be either.

14908
12:39:08,250 --> 12:39:10,170
We don't know which thumbs up it's gonna be.

14909
12:39:11,610 --> 12:39:12,610
Thumbs up.

14910
12:39:14,210 --> 12:39:15,570
We don't know.

14911
12:39:19,150 --> 12:39:22,870
It could be I'm having a great time and you wanna fucking eat a raccoon.

14912
12:39:28,520 --> 12:39:29,320
Let's go.

14913
12:39:29,540 --> 12:39:31,880
Thumbs up everybody, thumbs up.

14914
12:39:34,720 --> 12:39:36,180
Thumbs fucking up.

14915
12:39:51,140 --> 12:39:53,540
I don't know who any of these people are.

14916
12:39:53,980 --> 12:39:55,220
Oh, it's a power of love.

14917
12:39:55,560 --> 12:39:56,820
It's a power of fucking...

14918
12:39:57,610 --> 12:39:59,000
Oh my god.

14919
12:40:00,630 --> 12:40:02,880
You're that KDA raccoon.

14920
12:40:03,960 --> 12:40:06,220
You're that KDA fucking raccoon.

14921
12:40:06,300 --> 12:40:07,560
I remember you.

14922
12:40:08,280 --> 12:40:10,460
I remember you.

14923
12:40:19,850 --> 12:40:21,230
I'm losing it.

14924
12:40:21,250 --> 12:40:21,810
I am.

14925
12:40:21,950 --> 12:40:22,650
I am.

14926
12:40:22,710 --> 12:40:25,010
I'm settling with 150.

14927
12:40:29,460 --> 12:40:30,420
I'm settling.

14928
12:40:30,680 --> 12:40:33,660
I know I said 200, but like I...

14929
12:40:34,720 --> 12:40:36,140
Today's been rough.

14930
12:40:36,480 --> 12:40:41,300
Today has to be one of the roughest sessions.

14931
12:40:42,160 --> 12:40:45,520
Because I'm literally stuck in purgatory.

14932
12:40:49,840 --> 12:40:51,980
I don't have enough.

14933
12:40:52,080 --> 12:40:52,900
Oh thank god.

14934
12:40:53,100 --> 12:40:58,800
I was gonna say I don't have enough fucking voice slots for these.

14935
12:40:59,080 --> 12:41:00,780
Where did they come from?

14936
12:41:00,780 --> 12:41:03,620
It's like they just showed up.

14937
12:41:03,880 --> 12:41:07,420
It's like they literally showed up out of nowhere.

14938
12:41:07,780 --> 12:41:09,060
Where did they come from?

14939
12:41:16,860 --> 12:41:18,780
A bad raccoon.

14940
12:41:18,980 --> 12:41:20,280
It's not meta.

14941
12:41:21,000 --> 12:41:23,080
Why do you hear that they're meta?

14942
12:41:32,550 --> 12:41:33,590
It's fine.

14943
12:41:33,870 --> 12:41:34,770
It's fine.

14944
12:41:35,070 --> 12:41:35,650
I'm okay.

14945
12:41:37,910 --> 12:41:39,010
I'm okay.

14946
12:41:48,340 --> 12:41:49,480
It's fine.

14947
12:41:51,640 --> 12:41:52,380
It's time.

14948
12:41:53,900 --> 12:41:55,040
Guys, it's time.

14949
12:41:56,700 --> 12:41:57,900
I can... It's time.

14950
12:42:00,220 --> 12:42:01,240
Oh my god.

14951
12:42:01,380 --> 12:42:02,180
Oh my god.

14952
12:42:02,180 --> 12:42:02,920
It's time.

14953
12:42:04,040 --> 12:42:05,940
They have a raccoon.

14954
12:42:06,140 --> 12:42:06,800
It's fine.

14955
12:42:08,480 --> 12:42:09,100
Yeah.

14956
12:42:17,050 --> 12:42:20,930
I mean, did it say he was throwing?

14957
12:42:26,190 --> 12:42:35,930
I feel like we have to try so hard to win these games.

14958
12:42:40,850 --> 12:42:41,690
Oh my god.

14959
12:42:42,030 --> 12:42:47,790
I miss Rosa.

14960
12:42:48,770 --> 12:42:51,050
I'm gonna cry.

14961
12:42:59,490 --> 12:43:01,810
I'm so locked.

14962
12:43:01,930 --> 12:43:03,170
I'm so locked in.

14963
12:43:04,750 --> 12:43:07,150
I'm locked in as hell.

14964
12:43:10,950 --> 12:43:11,970
That was real.

14965
12:43:12,650 --> 12:43:15,150
Oh my god.

14966
12:43:22,360 --> 12:43:23,080
Logang.

14967
12:43:29,180 --> 12:43:30,480
Magic too.

14968
12:43:31,200 --> 12:43:31,920
Magic.

14969
12:43:32,040 --> 12:43:32,420
Magic.

14970
12:43:33,140 --> 12:43:33,860
Logang.

14971
12:43:34,240 --> 12:43:34,600
Logang.

14972
12:43:34,720 --> 12:43:34,940
Logang.

14973
12:43:35,020 --> 12:43:35,260
Logang.

14974
12:43:35,340 --> 12:43:36,840
Oh, you gotta see this over.

14975
12:43:38,020 --> 12:43:39,420
Otherwise, I get Logang.

14976
12:43:40,680 --> 12:43:41,920
Oh my god.

14977
12:43:45,880 --> 12:43:48,320
I don't think we have enough heals for Adam.

14978
12:44:01,380 --> 12:44:02,120
I stole it.

14979
12:44:02,980 --> 12:44:05,920
No, I think you stay stole it, man.

14980
12:44:10,000 --> 12:44:10,680
Jesus Christ.

14981
12:44:11,740 --> 12:44:12,220
I'll be just...

14982
12:44:13,320 --> 12:44:14,020
Wait, he's one.

14983
12:44:14,160 --> 12:44:14,480
Magic's one.

14984
12:44:15,260 --> 12:44:16,440
Oh, I got one.

14985
12:44:16,520 --> 12:44:16,760
I got one.

14986
12:44:16,940 --> 12:44:17,060
Nice.

14987
12:44:17,100 --> 12:44:17,240
Nice.

14988
12:44:17,500 --> 12:44:17,620
Nice.

14989
12:44:17,720 --> 12:44:17,820
Nice.

14990
12:44:17,820 --> 12:44:18,020
Nice.

14991
12:44:18,020 --> 12:44:18,300
Nice.

14992
12:44:19,500 --> 12:44:19,840
Push.

14993
12:44:20,000 --> 12:44:20,100
Push.

14994
12:44:20,200 --> 12:44:20,320
Push.

14995
12:44:20,400 --> 12:44:20,520
Push.

14996
12:44:20,600 --> 12:44:20,680
Push.

14997
12:44:22,320 --> 12:44:23,000
I got another.

14998
12:44:25,300 --> 12:44:26,220
We're up to...

14999
12:44:27,260 --> 12:44:27,620
Madness.

15000
12:44:27,700 --> 12:44:28,400
Madness is so low.

15001
12:44:29,260 --> 12:44:30,360
Oh, goodbye, everybody.

15002
12:44:30,580 --> 12:44:30,840
Oh, wait.

15003
12:44:30,960 --> 12:44:32,400
Hey, is this...

15004
12:44:32,400 --> 12:44:32,860
I'm cocooning.

15005
12:44:33,020 --> 12:44:33,360
I'm cocooning.

15006
12:44:34,060 --> 12:44:34,420
Sleeping.

15007
12:44:36,500 --> 12:44:37,020
Behind you.

15008
12:44:37,040 --> 12:44:37,420
Behind you.

15009
12:44:37,520 --> 12:44:37,840
He's one.

15010
12:44:37,940 --> 12:44:38,280
He's one.

15011
12:44:38,380 --> 12:44:38,700
He's one.

15012
12:44:40,900 --> 12:44:41,260
Wait.

15013
12:44:42,580 --> 12:44:42,580
Wait.

15014
12:44:43,480 --> 12:44:43,740
Change.

15015
12:44:43,760 --> 12:44:44,000
Change.

15016
12:44:44,000 --> 12:44:44,140
Change.

15017
12:44:44,340 --> 12:44:45,100
Change on cart.

15018
12:44:45,260 --> 12:44:45,720
Change on cart.

15019
12:44:47,200 --> 12:44:48,000
Guys, change on cart.

15020
12:44:49,020 --> 12:44:49,560
I'm coming.

15021
12:44:49,660 --> 12:44:49,860
I'm coming.

15022
12:44:49,900 --> 12:44:50,200
Turn around.

15023
12:44:53,180 --> 12:44:53,640
He's one.

15024
12:44:53,760 --> 12:44:54,040
He's one.

15025
12:44:54,900 --> 12:44:55,840
Okay, I have ult here.

15026
12:44:57,660 --> 12:44:58,580
Low gank, no passive.

15027
12:45:00,160 --> 12:45:03,800
And I think you need to set up for your ult on Starlord because they have no defensive.

15028
12:45:04,140 --> 12:45:05,700
I think their Mantis ult is still not out.

15029
12:45:06,260 --> 12:45:06,980
It should be pretty free.

15030
12:45:07,500 --> 12:45:07,700
I don't care.

15031
12:45:07,880 --> 12:45:08,640
You should set up for res.

15032
12:45:08,900 --> 12:45:09,160
Yeah.

15033
12:45:09,220 --> 12:45:09,280
Yeah.

15034
12:45:09,300 --> 12:45:09,380
Yeah.

15035
12:45:09,380 --> 12:45:12,100
I'm just pushing the cart a little bit and I'll go set up for res.

15036
12:45:12,700 --> 12:45:13,240
I'm pushing.

15037
12:45:13,680 --> 12:45:14,760
I'm setting up for res now.

15038
12:45:27,080 --> 12:45:27,600
He's one.

15039
12:45:29,440 --> 12:45:29,980
He's one.

15040
12:45:30,020 --> 12:45:30,020
He's one.

15041
12:45:30,080 --> 12:45:31,840
Okay, I'm not going to set up.

15042
12:45:32,000 --> 12:45:32,500
Change.

15043
12:45:32,740 --> 12:45:32,740
Change.

15044
12:45:38,540 --> 12:45:39,500
I'm pushing cart.

15045
12:45:41,120 --> 12:45:42,500
Oh my god.

15046
12:45:44,000 --> 12:45:45,160
See you guys.

15047
12:45:46,040 --> 12:45:47,280
I can add him.

15048
12:45:47,380 --> 12:45:49,360
I see as we might lose this game anyway.

15049
12:45:49,860 --> 12:45:50,680
Who knows.

15050
12:45:51,860 --> 12:45:53,160
I'm just going to push cart.

15051
12:45:53,380 --> 12:45:53,780
I'm pushing cart.

15052
12:45:56,820 --> 12:45:57,600
Goodbye.

15053
12:45:58,860 --> 12:45:59,600
Goodbye.

15054
12:46:05,500 --> 12:46:06,400
You only have Mantis heals.

15055
12:46:06,520 --> 12:46:07,560
I'm just pushing cart.

15056
12:46:13,660 --> 12:46:15,460
They're so healthy.

15057
12:46:20,820 --> 12:46:22,940
I'm setting it up.

15058
12:46:25,240 --> 12:46:27,060
Oh, actually we can just die here.

15059
12:46:27,140 --> 12:46:27,440
Honestly.

15060
12:46:28,720 --> 12:46:31,070
I don't think it's worth resing.

15061
12:46:40,830 --> 12:46:42,010
I don't have heals for you.

15062
12:46:47,220 --> 12:46:48,000
He's strangled.

15063
12:46:49,340 --> 12:46:50,480
Oh, I got hit.

15064
12:46:51,100 --> 12:46:51,800
Thank you.

15065
12:46:52,200 --> 12:46:52,580
I got you.

15066
12:46:52,720 --> 12:46:52,920
Change.

15067
12:46:53,240 --> 12:46:53,700
Change.

15068
12:46:53,700 --> 12:46:53,760
Change.

15069
12:46:53,800 --> 12:46:53,880
Change one.

15070
12:46:53,960 --> 12:46:54,320
Change one.

15071
12:46:56,600 --> 12:46:57,780
Oh, it's my warriors.

15072
12:46:58,300 --> 12:47:00,260
Oh, magic's one.

15073
12:47:00,420 --> 12:47:01,280
I'm pushing cart.

15074
12:47:03,620 --> 12:47:05,060
There's someone behind us.

15075
12:47:10,000 --> 12:47:11,340
I heard something.

15076
12:47:13,000 --> 12:47:14,080
We're both pushing cart.

15077
12:47:14,160 --> 12:47:16,260
Mantis and I are pushing cart so you need heals.

15078
12:47:17,680 --> 12:47:19,540
Yeah, I need to set up for res.

15079
12:47:23,200 --> 12:47:25,100
I'm just going to push a little bit more.

15080
12:47:25,740 --> 12:47:26,860
You should heal our teammates.

15081
12:47:32,200 --> 12:47:34,240
He's inside the house.

15082
12:47:40,630 --> 12:47:41,590
I'm pushing.

15083
12:47:47,270 --> 12:47:47,750
Magic.

15084
12:47:51,010 --> 12:47:51,490
Magic.

15085
12:47:51,810 --> 12:47:52,110
Magic.

15086
12:47:54,610 --> 12:47:55,090
Logang.

15087
12:47:55,090 --> 12:47:55,890
Logang missed.

15088
12:47:57,850 --> 12:47:58,210
Come on.

15089
12:47:58,350 --> 12:47:58,570
Mag-heal.

15090
12:47:58,650 --> 12:47:58,890
Mag-heal.

15091
12:47:59,430 --> 12:47:59,810
Mag-heal.

15092
12:48:00,050 --> 12:48:00,310
Mag-heal.

15093
12:48:00,330 --> 12:48:00,570
Mag-heal.

15094
12:48:00,770 --> 12:48:01,350
Mag-heal.

15095
12:48:01,450 --> 12:48:02,630
I got him.

15096
12:48:05,110 --> 12:48:06,570
No second chance left.

15097
12:48:16,120 --> 12:48:17,890
What is he doing?

15098
12:48:26,200 --> 12:48:27,230
I'm pushing cart.

15099
12:48:28,110 --> 12:48:28,640
There's a...

15100
12:48:38,330 --> 12:48:40,630
Oh, I solo-linked us.

15101
12:48:42,730 --> 12:48:43,470
Break.

15102
12:48:45,350 --> 12:48:45,490
Break.

15103
12:48:45,570 --> 12:48:45,570
Break.

15104
12:48:45,670 --> 12:48:45,750
Break.

15105
12:48:46,390 --> 12:48:48,510
This is real firepower!

15106
12:48:49,050 --> 12:48:51,030
I have magic on me.

15107
12:48:52,190 --> 12:48:52,890
Magic one.

15108
12:48:53,150 --> 12:48:53,150
Nice.

15109
12:48:56,350 --> 12:48:58,030
I'm asleep.

15110
12:49:05,130 --> 12:49:06,990
No more heals.

15111
12:49:07,150 --> 12:49:07,490
No more heals.

15112
12:49:09,050 --> 12:49:10,250
Logang on me.

15113
12:49:10,550 --> 12:49:11,270
Logang on me.

15114
12:49:11,270 --> 12:49:11,830
Hello?

15115
12:49:13,790 --> 12:49:14,910
I'm pushing up.

15116
12:49:15,050 --> 12:49:15,670
Logang right side.

15117
12:49:15,770 --> 12:49:16,270
Logang right side.

15118
12:49:17,290 --> 12:49:18,050
Logang one point.

15119
12:49:18,230 --> 12:49:18,530
Logang.

15120
12:49:18,750 --> 12:49:18,990
One.

15121
12:49:19,110 --> 12:49:19,130
One.

15122
12:49:19,190 --> 12:49:19,290
One.

15123
12:49:19,350 --> 12:49:20,050
He has no passive.

15124
12:49:20,190 --> 12:49:20,690
He has no passive.

15125
12:49:21,610 --> 12:49:22,030
Logang dead.

15126
12:49:22,230 --> 12:49:22,530
Magic.

15127
12:49:22,930 --> 12:49:23,110
Magic.

15128
12:49:24,990 --> 12:49:26,450
I got ulted by...

15129
12:49:31,090 --> 12:49:32,470
I am cocooning.

15130
12:49:32,670 --> 12:49:33,110
Cocooning.

15131
12:49:33,110 --> 12:49:33,790
Okay, still have no heals.

15132
12:49:39,470 --> 12:49:40,990
I got... I got Wolverine.

15133
12:49:41,090 --> 12:49:41,590
Logang dead.

15134
12:49:43,270 --> 12:49:43,710
Groot.

15135
12:49:44,330 --> 12:49:45,310
He is Groot.

15136
12:49:45,510 --> 12:49:46,210
I'm on cart.

15137
12:49:46,330 --> 12:49:46,730
I'm on cart.

15138
12:49:47,750 --> 12:49:48,690
Groot is dead.

15139
12:49:49,370 --> 12:49:49,790
I'm asleep.

15140
12:49:50,350 --> 12:49:50,770
Can you shoot too?

15141
12:49:51,150 --> 12:49:51,650
Yeah, I'm shooting.

15142
12:49:51,850 --> 12:49:52,090
I'm shooting.

15143
12:49:52,510 --> 12:49:55,110
I have ult in 10.

15144
12:49:57,830 --> 12:49:59,190
I can get ult soon.

15145
12:49:59,190 --> 12:50:01,110
Watch me.

15146
12:50:01,650 --> 12:50:02,010
Push.

15147
12:50:02,150 --> 12:50:02,150
Push.

15148
12:50:02,190 --> 12:50:02,510
Push.

15149
12:50:02,510 --> 12:50:02,850
Push.

15150
12:50:02,850 --> 12:50:03,310
Push with her.

15151
12:50:05,290 --> 12:50:05,870
Behind us.

15152
12:50:05,930 --> 12:50:06,330
Behind us.

15153
12:50:06,370 --> 12:50:06,630
Magic.

15154
12:50:06,750 --> 12:50:06,930
Magic.

15155
12:50:07,030 --> 12:50:07,210
Magic.

15156
12:50:07,310 --> 12:50:07,490
Magic.

15157
12:50:07,970 --> 12:50:08,810
Turn around and help.

15158
12:50:09,010 --> 12:50:09,570
Turn around and help.

15159
12:50:09,750 --> 12:50:10,250
Turn around and help.

15160
12:50:10,310 --> 12:50:10,750
Magic solo.

15161
12:50:10,810 --> 12:50:11,290
Magic solo.

15162
12:50:11,610 --> 12:50:13,090
I'm gonna set up for rez.

15163
12:50:13,630 --> 12:50:14,570
If you guys can push the cart.

15164
12:50:16,590 --> 12:50:16,990
I have ult.

15165
12:50:17,830 --> 12:50:18,510
I'm pushing up.

15166
12:50:18,590 --> 12:50:19,510
I'm getting ready for rez.

15167
12:50:22,470 --> 12:50:22,990
I have ult.

15168
12:50:22,990 --> 12:50:22,990
I have ult.

15169
12:50:22,990 --> 12:50:22,990
I have ult.

15170
12:50:22,990 --> 12:50:22,990
Cap.

15171
12:50:23,010 --> 12:50:23,310
Cap.

15172
12:50:23,530 --> 12:50:23,530
Cap.

15173
12:50:23,610 --> 12:50:24,070
Cap.

15174
12:50:24,070 --> 12:50:24,090
Cap.

15175
12:50:24,130 --> 12:50:24,230
Cap.

15176
12:50:24,230 --> 12:50:24,430
Cap.

15177
12:50:25,110 --> 12:50:25,410
Cap.

15178
12:50:25,410 --> 12:50:25,510
Cap.

15179
12:50:26,470 --> 12:50:26,990
Cap.

15180
12:50:27,430 --> 12:50:27,710
Cap.

15181
12:50:27,810 --> 12:50:28,290
Cap.

15182
12:50:28,550 --> 12:50:29,070
Cap.

15183
12:50:29,270 --> 12:50:29,390
Cap.

15184
12:50:30,130 --> 12:50:30,370
Clap.

15185
12:50:30,530 --> 12:50:30,850
Clap.

15186
12:50:31,970 --> 12:50:34,150
Yeah, they're manning stone.

15187
12:50:37,230 --> 12:50:38,470
I have U salt.

15188
12:50:38,570 --> 12:50:39,050
I have C salt.

15189
12:50:44,310 --> 12:50:46,370
Go for the Eng aglore.

15190
12:50:46,370 --> 12:50:47,730
Use your passive.

15191
12:50:51,110 --> 12:50:53,310
Oh my god, goodbye.

15192
12:50:53,870 --> 12:50:54,810
I used Toba.

15193
12:50:55,310 --> 12:50:57,330
Cap, cap, cap him, cap him!

15194
12:50:57,710 --> 12:50:58,310
Nice.

15195
12:51:00,630 --> 12:51:02,090
Magic, magic, magic, magic!

15196
12:51:05,570 --> 12:51:06,530
Oh, he's low.

15197
12:51:07,830 --> 12:51:08,730
Oh, that's so good.

15198
12:51:10,110 --> 12:51:14,130
Oh my god, I told you I could play Adam!

15199
12:51:14,130 --> 12:51:14,830
I...

15200
12:51:17,850 --> 12:51:20,730
I told you I don't know what trick!

15201
12:51:21,650 --> 12:51:24,810
I told you I don't have to play other heroes.

15202
12:51:29,630 --> 12:51:33,990
I told you, I told you I could do Adam Warlock.

15203
12:51:35,950 --> 12:51:39,410
I just wish he has... his ass is so flat though.

15204
12:51:39,490 --> 12:51:40,410
That's my only...

15205
12:51:41,850 --> 12:51:42,630
What is it?

15206
12:51:42,830 --> 12:51:44,530
He's supposed to be like the perfect being.

15207
12:51:45,150 --> 12:51:46,410
Why the fuck is his ass...

15208
12:51:48,670 --> 12:51:49,070
True.

15209
12:51:50,030 --> 12:51:52,570
I thought he was supposed to be one of the most perfect human...

15210
12:51:53,010 --> 12:51:53,830
Like, not being, sorry.

15211
12:51:54,210 --> 12:51:56,090
One of the most perfect specimens out there.

15212
12:51:56,170 --> 12:51:57,570
And yet his ass is so flat.

15213
12:51:58,790 --> 12:52:01,030
But yeah, that ass is tragic, it is.

15214
12:52:03,090 --> 12:52:04,430
Nice thighs though.

15215
12:52:13,840 --> 12:52:16,460
See, this is why Raccoons need to be put out.

15216
12:52:17,000 --> 12:52:18,080
Out the shed.

15217
12:52:20,600 --> 12:52:22,880
Venom literally stole all his ass.

15218
12:52:30,960 --> 12:52:31,920
Oh yeah.

15219
12:52:33,980 --> 12:52:35,180
Guys, what did he say?

15220
12:52:37,300 --> 12:52:39,700
Guys, I just said okay, but I don't know what he said.

15221
12:52:49,080 --> 12:52:49,520
Headbutt.

15222
12:52:53,290 --> 12:52:54,170
Oh no.

15223
12:52:56,670 --> 12:52:59,890
Okay, I need to be like super careful with my heals.

15224
12:53:05,950 --> 12:53:06,390
Alright.

15225
12:53:10,210 --> 12:53:10,570
Keep up.

15226
12:53:11,350 --> 12:53:12,090
Wait, there's chains!

15227
12:53:12,190 --> 12:53:12,930
Chains pushed up!

15228
12:53:15,690 --> 12:53:16,910
Oh, you're so...

15229
12:53:16,910 --> 12:53:18,310
Reg, reg, reg, reg, reg, reg.

15230
12:53:18,310 --> 12:53:19,730
You're walled off, you're walled off.

15231
12:53:25,120 --> 12:53:26,220
I have TP though.

15232
12:53:27,640 --> 12:53:29,300
Oh, this is bad.

15233
12:53:29,500 --> 12:53:30,260
I think I can TP in time.

15234
12:53:31,200 --> 12:53:31,400
Yeah.

15235
12:53:32,420 --> 12:53:33,920
We can TP, we can TP, it's fine.

15236
12:53:34,320 --> 12:53:34,960
Nah, I can TP, I can TP.

15237
12:53:35,540 --> 12:53:38,120
I TP, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

15238
12:53:45,360 --> 12:53:46,360
I linked us.

15239
12:53:46,360 --> 12:53:46,400
I linked us.

15240
12:53:59,580 --> 12:54:01,700
Is this... I'm cocooning.

15241
12:54:05,660 --> 12:54:06,380
Nice job.

15242
12:54:06,600 --> 12:54:07,060
Rook in, rook in.

15243
12:54:07,100 --> 12:54:08,840
I couldn't, there's a... point, point, point, point!

15244
12:54:12,580 --> 12:54:13,340
That's unlucky.

15245
12:54:17,780 --> 12:54:18,260
I...

15246
12:54:18,260 --> 12:54:20,620
I'll swap to Loki after I feel like we might need more heals.

15247
12:54:24,700 --> 12:54:25,900
Oh my god.

15248
12:54:31,780 --> 12:54:32,260
Boop!

15249
12:54:33,620 --> 12:54:35,520
Alright, it's time to learn Loki again.

15250
12:54:35,680 --> 12:54:37,200
I don't remember how to play Loki.

15251
12:54:38,760 --> 12:54:41,380
But I feel like we definitely need the heals.

15252
12:54:43,700 --> 12:54:44,980
I have Rez here.

15253
12:54:46,060 --> 12:54:47,880
They should have Bucky ult, they have Bucky ult.

15254
12:54:53,440 --> 12:54:55,580
There you go.

15255
12:54:56,680 --> 12:54:57,560
You're alive.

15256
12:55:00,780 --> 12:55:01,920
I have Bucky on me.

15257
12:55:08,490 --> 12:55:11,030
I'm trying to... I can't get to you guys.

15258
12:55:14,050 --> 12:55:15,850
I'm almost got it, I got it!

15259
12:55:19,350 --> 12:55:20,150
Trench is low.

15260
12:55:23,530 --> 12:55:25,970
I don't know how the fuck that worked.

15261
12:55:26,810 --> 12:55:28,250
It worked out, thank god.

15262
12:55:31,030 --> 12:55:32,030
What did he say?

15263
12:55:33,290 --> 12:55:35,230
I'm sorry, he's like mumbling.

15264
12:55:36,570 --> 12:55:37,030
He's...

15265
12:55:37,710 --> 12:55:39,810
He's like mumbling what...

15266
12:55:39,810 --> 12:55:40,490
Oh, he's playing close.

15267
12:55:41,350 --> 12:55:43,090
Yeah, we're playing... Oh, there's a group behind you.

15268
12:55:46,350 --> 12:55:47,050
I'm asleep.

15269
12:55:47,050 --> 12:55:48,270
Groot's half, Groot's half.

15270
12:55:53,930 --> 12:55:55,170
There's another Mortar left.

15271
12:56:01,220 --> 12:56:02,640
I got you, I got you, Mag.

15272
12:56:03,420 --> 12:56:04,540
We're just gonna have ult here.

15273
12:56:08,300 --> 12:56:09,020
There's a Groot.

15274
12:56:10,460 --> 12:56:11,300
He's one, he's one.

15275
12:56:13,780 --> 12:56:16,000
Okay guys, I know where I'm using my Strangeload.

15276
12:56:16,660 --> 12:56:17,840
He's opening a port though.

15277
12:56:19,620 --> 12:56:21,000
He doesn't have Strangeload, does he?

15278
12:56:22,020 --> 12:56:22,740
Wait, byes!

15279
12:56:28,660 --> 12:56:30,480
I don't have any heals now, you know?

15280
12:56:32,300 --> 12:56:33,420
Oh, this is bad.

15281
12:56:34,240 --> 12:56:35,300
I still bonded.

15282
12:56:35,980 --> 12:56:37,340
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

15283
12:56:37,620 --> 12:56:39,160
You still have... That died fast, that died fast.

15284
12:56:40,320 --> 12:56:42,340
I'm not gonna use my cocoon.

15285
12:56:42,360 --> 12:56:42,900
I have ult here.

15286
12:56:43,900 --> 12:56:44,620
Not yet, not yet, yeah.

15287
12:56:45,600 --> 12:56:46,320
Yeah, that's good.

15288
12:56:47,540 --> 12:56:51,240
You can use your first solo, I don't think they have Mantis yet.

15289
12:56:51,420 --> 12:56:53,180
Yeah, you need to go solo, yeah.

15290
12:56:54,240 --> 12:56:55,680
Yeah, Strangeload, Strangeload on me.

15291
12:56:56,020 --> 12:56:57,660
They're holding really close, I need that.

15292
12:56:58,800 --> 12:56:59,780
He ulted me.

15293
12:57:00,520 --> 12:57:01,920
But I can cocoon, I can cocoon.

15294
12:57:03,040 --> 12:57:03,960
I'm ulting this.

15295
12:57:04,180 --> 12:57:05,040
I can't, I can't.

15296
12:57:07,040 --> 12:57:08,880
I'm trying to touch base, I'm gonna die.

15297
12:57:09,220 --> 12:57:10,000
I can't, I'm dead.

15298
12:57:10,440 --> 12:57:10,800
No!

15299
12:57:12,560 --> 12:57:13,980
Wait, wait, wait, we're touching, we're touching, we're touching!

15300
12:57:13,980 --> 12:57:15,000
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go.

15301
12:57:15,920 --> 12:57:17,600
I'm backing out, backing out now, I'm backing out.

15302
12:57:19,900 --> 12:57:21,520
No more second chance, no more second chance.

15303
12:57:23,120 --> 12:57:23,700
Nice, nice, nice!

15304
12:57:24,180 --> 12:57:25,280
I'm on Groot, I'm on Groot.

15305
12:57:27,280 --> 12:57:28,740
Groot one, Groot one, Groot one!

15306
12:57:29,840 --> 12:57:30,380
Change one.

15307
12:57:31,180 --> 12:57:31,580
I got him.

15308
12:57:32,380 --> 12:57:32,700
Nice.

15309
12:57:37,040 --> 12:57:38,160
Oh my god.

15310
12:57:39,460 --> 12:57:41,000
We can just wait for our ultimate charge.

15311
12:57:41,080 --> 12:57:41,260
Let's go.

15312
12:57:42,020 --> 12:57:43,540
We did, I think we did.

15313
12:57:43,960 --> 12:57:44,440
We did?

15314
12:57:44,540 --> 12:57:44,880
Okay, cool.

15315
12:57:45,180 --> 12:57:46,220
Did they have Groot ult then?

15316
12:57:47,140 --> 12:57:48,180
No, they didn't.

15317
12:57:48,260 --> 12:57:49,000
No, no, no.

15318
12:57:49,800 --> 12:57:50,140
That's fine.

15319
12:57:50,900 --> 12:57:52,140
We can play without one of my grenades on.

15320
12:57:52,520 --> 12:57:52,840
I might.

15321
12:57:54,520 --> 12:57:58,080
Go, go, go!

15322
12:58:06,260 --> 12:58:08,880
Oh my god, I'm soulbinding, I'm soulbinding us.

15323
12:58:09,700 --> 12:58:10,660
Yeah, I'm chilling, I'm chilling.

15324
12:58:12,960 --> 12:58:14,080
I probably stole it.

15325
12:58:14,280 --> 12:58:14,860
Yeah, I did.

15326
12:58:17,420 --> 12:58:18,360
Play the choke.

15327
12:58:22,060 --> 12:58:22,680
I'm gonna wall.

15328
12:58:23,760 --> 12:58:24,840
I got one, I got one!

15329
12:58:25,300 --> 12:58:25,840
I'm out of blood.

15330
12:58:26,380 --> 12:58:29,300
Oh, I don't have soulbind too.

15331
12:58:32,240 --> 12:58:32,840
Raccoon's weak.

15332
12:58:34,880 --> 12:58:37,580
You only have Mantis heals, you're walled off from Mantis heals.

15333
12:58:39,980 --> 12:58:41,640
Watch this, watch this.

15334
12:58:41,760 --> 12:58:42,720
We'll come back, we'll come back.

15335
12:58:43,040 --> 12:58:43,660
Oh, I got slept?

15336
12:58:43,940 --> 12:58:44,760
That's good, that's good, that's good.

15337
12:58:45,180 --> 12:58:45,720
I stole my ult.

15338
12:58:45,840 --> 12:58:46,800
Tracer's behind us, behind us.

15339
12:58:47,300 --> 12:58:47,960
I'm coming back.

15340
12:58:48,940 --> 12:58:49,600
Tracer, Tracer, Tracer.

15341
12:58:51,120 --> 12:58:52,380
Nice, nice, nice, that's a good...

15342
12:58:53,260 --> 12:58:54,280
I'm soulbinding, I'm soulbinding.

15343
12:58:56,280 --> 12:58:57,000
Turn around, turn around.

15344
12:58:57,780 --> 12:58:58,180
Got him, got him.

15345
12:59:01,520 --> 12:59:02,040
Jump, jump.

15346
12:59:09,140 --> 12:59:09,600
Yes!

15347
12:59:12,380 --> 12:59:14,400
I'm insane, I had him!

15348
12:59:18,540 --> 12:59:20,640
Told you I'm not a one trick!

15349
12:59:21,900 --> 12:59:22,820
Told you!

15350
12:59:24,780 --> 12:59:26,140
Alright, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

15351
12:59:26,320 --> 12:59:27,180
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

15352
12:59:27,640 --> 12:59:30,020
I'll be like, alright, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

15353
12:59:30,420 --> 12:59:31,560
Thank you.

15354
12:59:33,600 --> 12:59:35,680
I didn't even need Loki.

15355
12:59:35,920 --> 12:59:38,280
I didn't even need him.

15356
12:59:39,140 --> 12:59:41,560
I'm actually not a one trick.

15357
12:59:42,000 --> 12:59:44,800
I told you I can play other characters.

15358
12:59:44,980 --> 12:59:46,760
I fucking told you.

15359
12:59:49,780 --> 12:59:52,340
I beat the allocations.

15360
12:59:53,160 --> 12:59:56,100
I told you my fucking mind expanded there.

15361
13:00:00,180 --> 13:00:05,640
I can even carry with a 180 ping on Adam.

15362
13:00:05,780 --> 13:00:07,800
I fucking solo died in Amora.

15363
13:00:07,800 --> 13:00:10,000
He wasn't even looking.

15364
13:00:10,120 --> 13:00:11,200
I shot him in the back.

15365
13:00:11,340 --> 13:00:14,480
He looked forward and I go pop, pop in the back.

15366
13:00:14,580 --> 13:00:15,520
That's what you write.

15367
13:00:18,780 --> 13:00:20,720
Marco, thank you for the five gifted subs.

15368
13:00:20,840 --> 13:00:21,900
Thank you, thank you.

15369
13:00:22,660 --> 13:00:23,920
I really appreciate it.

15370
13:00:24,180 --> 13:00:25,400
Epic, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

15371
13:00:25,440 --> 13:00:26,460
Thank you, thank you.

15372
13:00:26,640 --> 13:00:27,720
Yeah, he took those back shots.

15373
13:00:27,820 --> 13:00:28,420
That's fucking right.

15374
13:00:28,480 --> 13:00:30,400
I hope he fucking closes his eyes and remembers me.

15375
13:00:30,540 --> 13:00:31,980
And I won't even call back.

15376
13:00:32,380 --> 13:00:37,540
I won't even call back.

15377
13:00:43,910 --> 13:00:46,050
B Porter, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

15378
13:00:46,170 --> 13:00:46,950
Thank you, thank you.

15379
13:00:46,990 --> 13:00:47,950
I really appreciate it.

15380
13:00:52,120 --> 13:00:56,700
Two, we just need two.

15381
13:00:57,620 --> 13:01:01,920
Will we be lucky enough to get those two though?

15382
13:01:02,100 --> 13:01:03,280
That's the question.

15383
13:01:04,120 --> 13:01:07,020
Will we be graced with the two?

15384
13:01:14,750 --> 13:01:16,290
Just gotta believe.

15385
13:01:17,950 --> 13:01:19,010
Gotta believe.

15386
13:01:19,870 --> 13:01:23,310
When can we get Spider-Man gameplay?

15387
13:01:24,410 --> 13:01:26,830
Necros is literally beneath me right now.

15388
13:01:29,230 --> 13:01:31,350
He's down the street, guys.

15389
13:01:32,170 --> 13:01:34,110
Necros is down the street.

15390
13:01:47,970 --> 13:01:50,150
I don't know any of these names.

15391
13:01:50,870 --> 13:01:52,030
To be fair, I don't play in the morning.

15392
13:01:53,210 --> 13:01:54,850
Wait, that makes so much more sense.

15393
13:01:54,930 --> 13:01:56,670
I'm like, who are these people?

15394
13:01:56,830 --> 13:01:59,430
And I'm like, oh yeah, I don't exist in the morning.

15395
13:01:59,530 --> 13:02:01,410
This is the first time I see these people.

15396
13:02:02,090 --> 13:02:03,050
In these hours.

15397
13:02:06,530 --> 13:02:10,510
I've never seen these people before because I've never played around these times.

15398
13:02:12,650 --> 13:02:15,990
I swear to God, if they don't ban Hawkeye, I'm gonna freaking freak out.

15399
13:02:18,570 --> 13:02:19,830
You need to ban Storm.

15400
13:02:23,250 --> 13:02:25,330
You're right, ban Storm.

15401
13:02:29,720 --> 13:02:31,200
Gil, thank you for the super chat.

15402
13:02:31,400 --> 13:02:32,580
Oh, not super chat, thank you.

15403
13:02:32,660 --> 13:02:33,040
I'm sorry.

15404
13:02:33,720 --> 13:02:34,900
You wanna play Hella here?

15405
13:02:35,040 --> 13:02:35,580
We're banning Hella, right?

15406
13:02:35,820 --> 13:02:37,140
Who the fuck plays Magic?

15407
13:02:37,640 --> 13:02:38,660
Get Hella out.

15408
13:02:39,000 --> 13:02:41,360
Thank you for the tier 1 sub for 11 months.

15409
13:02:41,460 --> 13:02:42,360
Thank you, thank you.

15410
13:02:42,740 --> 13:02:44,420
Thank you for the gifted subs.

15411
13:02:44,800 --> 13:02:45,380
Thank you.

15412
13:02:45,580 --> 13:02:46,740
Astro, thank you for the $10.

15413
13:02:47,260 --> 13:02:47,800
Thank you, thank you.

15414
13:02:47,900 --> 13:02:49,360
Go to bed, don't let your...

15415
13:02:49,360 --> 13:02:49,580
No.

15416
13:02:50,220 --> 13:02:51,300
Two more games.

15417
13:02:51,780 --> 13:02:53,040
Not games, two more wins.

15418
13:02:53,240 --> 13:02:54,280
Or maybe three more wins.

15419
13:02:54,360 --> 13:02:55,720
Knowing me, it could be three wins.

15420
13:02:57,460 --> 13:02:58,300
Boring bans?

15421
13:02:58,620 --> 13:02:59,560
Who are you?

15422
13:03:02,240 --> 13:03:03,200
Alright, guys.

15423
13:03:06,000 --> 13:03:06,640
They banned Hulk.

15424
13:03:07,580 --> 13:03:09,120
We need a support player here, guys.

15425
13:03:10,120 --> 13:03:11,740
Lauki, how good is your Mantis?

15426
13:03:14,840 --> 13:03:17,340
He says, don't worry, King.

15427
13:03:17,400 --> 13:03:18,680
Okay, I believe in him.

15428
13:03:20,860 --> 13:03:21,740
Who bans for fun?

15429
13:03:21,800 --> 13:03:23,000
Who the fuck bans for...

15430
13:03:23,000 --> 13:03:25,160
Go back to, like, I don't know, Diamond.

15431
13:03:26,980 --> 13:03:28,160
Diamond or GM.

15432
13:03:28,160 --> 13:03:29,760
You're gonna ban for fun.

15433
13:03:30,800 --> 13:03:33,200
There's five days left of the season.

15434
13:03:37,730 --> 13:03:38,750
This is a game.

15435
13:03:39,410 --> 13:03:40,790
This is a game.

15436
13:03:42,390 --> 13:03:43,850
We have Glizzy Muncher.

15437
13:03:44,370 --> 13:03:48,890
These are the players at these hours.

15438
13:03:49,210 --> 13:03:49,890
Oh my god.

15439
13:03:49,890 --> 13:03:50,890
Oh my god.

15440
13:03:58,580 --> 13:04:02,620
I'd rather have play against a Hella than a Hawkeye.

15441
13:04:02,800 --> 13:04:05,140
Cause a Hella is more easily counterable.

15442
13:04:06,040 --> 13:04:08,600
Cause a Hella takes two shots to kill something.

15443
13:04:09,080 --> 13:04:10,780
But a Hawkeye takes one shot.

15444
13:04:12,280 --> 13:04:13,300
And a Hella can...

15445
13:04:13,300 --> 13:04:15,380
A Hawkeye can kill somebody out of...

15446
13:04:15,380 --> 13:04:17,140
Kill a Mantis and a Luna out of ult.

15447
13:04:17,500 --> 13:04:19,940
But a Hella can't do fucking shit when it comes to that.

15448
13:04:21,540 --> 13:04:23,180
A Hella can't kill...

15449
13:04:23,820 --> 13:04:25,200
Can't kill people out of ult.

15450
13:04:28,680 --> 13:04:29,640
They're pushing in right now.

15451
13:04:31,020 --> 13:04:32,080
Oh wait, that's ours.

15452
13:04:32,240 --> 13:04:32,980
I'm just coming in here.

15453
13:04:36,180 --> 13:04:37,520
I'd like to...

15454
13:04:38,880 --> 13:04:40,000
Prematurely use my eyes.

15455
13:04:40,280 --> 13:04:41,060
And Wolverine's coming.

15456
13:04:41,240 --> 13:04:41,940
Shoot the Wolverine.

15457
13:04:43,480 --> 13:04:44,480
Wolverine's back here.

15458
13:04:44,480 --> 13:04:45,000
Come here.

15459
13:04:45,480 --> 13:04:46,420
Make a difference.

15460
13:04:46,900 --> 13:04:48,660
We must marshal our defenses.

15461
13:04:48,960 --> 13:04:49,700
Place poison point.

15462
13:04:52,200 --> 13:04:54,300
Wolverine is gonna go behind me and grab somebody.

15463
13:04:54,780 --> 13:04:55,780
Wolverine's in front, man.

15464
13:04:58,680 --> 13:04:59,340
Logang, walk.

15465
13:04:59,900 --> 13:05:00,400
They're...

15466
13:05:00,400 --> 13:05:01,320
Contesting point.

15467
13:05:02,640 --> 13:05:03,240
I was worried.

15468
13:05:03,680 --> 13:05:04,060
I'm asleep.

15469
13:05:05,220 --> 13:05:05,620
Mike half.

15470
13:05:06,020 --> 13:05:07,420
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.

15471
13:05:07,620 --> 13:05:08,120
Wolverine.

15472
13:05:11,000 --> 13:05:11,740
I'm grabbed.

15473
13:05:12,320 --> 13:05:12,580
Nice.

15474
13:05:13,520 --> 13:05:14,360
Oh.

15475
13:05:14,540 --> 13:05:15,140
I'm still dead.

15476
13:05:17,420 --> 13:05:19,580
That was a lot of dabbing.

15477
13:05:25,360 --> 13:05:27,540
I guess I back up.

15478
13:05:28,220 --> 13:05:29,320
Wolverine low.

15479
13:05:37,350 --> 13:05:40,170
I don't know if I live.

15480
13:05:43,050 --> 13:05:43,890
Wow!

15481
13:05:49,670 --> 13:05:50,470
That was a...

15482
13:05:50,470 --> 13:05:52,250
A great escape.

15483
13:05:53,210 --> 13:05:56,810
Wait, Mantis ult first.

15484
13:06:01,390 --> 13:06:02,730
There's a Wolverine behind!

15485
13:06:02,830 --> 13:06:03,290
Wolverine behind!

15486
13:06:06,520 --> 13:06:11,280
Okay, I guess I ult too.

15487
13:06:13,860 --> 13:06:15,560
Our poor...

15488
13:06:15,560 --> 13:06:16,360
Our...

15489
13:06:16,360 --> 13:06:16,880
Our...

15490
13:06:16,880 --> 13:06:18,240
Our...

15491
13:06:18,240 --> 13:06:19,240
Our poor...

15492
13:06:19,840 --> 13:06:20,280
Oh...

15493
13:06:20,760 --> 13:06:21,240
My...

15494
13:06:21,820 --> 13:06:21,980
God.

15495
13:06:23,240 --> 13:06:24,380
Yeah, I'm trying.

15496
13:06:24,580 --> 13:06:25,460
I can't heal up.

15497
13:06:31,120 --> 13:06:31,880
Oh...

15498
13:06:31,880 --> 13:06:33,000
My...

15499
13:06:33,000 --> 13:06:33,020
God.

15500
13:06:35,400 --> 13:06:36,160
Guys,

15501
13:06:39,640 --> 13:06:40,840
this ain't looking so good.

15502
13:06:41,520 --> 13:06:42,280
This...

15503
13:06:42,280 --> 13:06:44,200
This ain't looking so good.

15504
13:06:46,860 --> 13:06:47,620
Oh,

15505
13:06:52,360 --> 13:06:53,100
my God.

15506
13:06:54,340 --> 13:06:56,660
Guys, this ain't looking so good.

15507
13:06:56,660 --> 13:06:58,280
Guys, it could be...

15508
13:06:58,280 --> 13:07:00,300
It's gonna be three games!

15509
13:07:04,420 --> 13:07:08,420
Guys, I have a feeling this might be three games again.

15510
13:07:10,740 --> 13:07:12,880
Oh, he swapped off and...

15511
13:07:12,880 --> 13:07:14,680
Okay, let's try and hook their Mag.

15512
13:07:21,440 --> 13:07:22,760
Guys, this...

15513
13:07:22,760 --> 13:07:24,920
This ain't looking so good for us.

15514
13:07:27,800 --> 13:07:28,460
This...

15515
13:07:28,460 --> 13:07:29,120
Mag sucks.

15516
13:07:30,620 --> 13:07:30,800
Let's go.

15517
13:07:31,280 --> 13:07:31,860
Let's sleep.

15518
13:07:32,140 --> 13:07:32,920
Help this guy.

15519
13:07:33,280 --> 13:07:34,240
Lazy Muncher needs help.

15520
13:07:36,020 --> 13:07:36,780
I'm grabbed.

15521
13:07:36,980 --> 13:07:37,720
I'm welled.

15522
13:07:39,040 --> 13:07:40,020
Where are we going, guys?

15523
13:07:40,740 --> 13:07:41,380
I'm welled, guys.

15524
13:07:43,260 --> 13:07:43,800
I'm down.

15525
13:07:43,940 --> 13:07:44,420
I'm low, guys.

15526
13:07:49,340 --> 13:07:49,880
Oh,

15527
13:07:57,220 --> 13:07:57,580
my God.

15528
13:07:58,080 --> 13:07:59,220
Oh, my God.

15529
13:07:59,440 --> 13:07:59,860
Please.

15530
13:08:02,880 --> 13:08:03,860
Wolverine's still left.

15531
13:08:08,150 --> 13:08:08,750
Hook Mag.

15532
13:08:14,170 --> 13:08:16,690
Oh, shut the fuck up, Mantis.

15533
13:08:17,610 --> 13:08:18,130
Logang.

15534
13:08:19,250 --> 13:08:20,090
Logang's up left.

15535
13:08:21,210 --> 13:08:21,690
I'm gonna ult.

15536
13:08:21,810 --> 13:08:22,270
I have Doppelganger.

15537
13:08:23,990 --> 13:08:24,670
That's good.

15538
13:08:30,730 --> 13:08:32,390
Three, two, one.

15539
13:08:39,900 --> 13:08:40,420
Oh,

15540
13:08:43,720 --> 13:08:44,240
my God.

15541
13:08:45,000 --> 13:08:45,600
I got a gunner.

15542
13:08:47,180 --> 13:08:48,060
He's tight-rooted, Mantis.

15543
13:08:51,560 --> 13:08:52,520
Pretty cool.

15544
13:08:53,920 --> 13:08:55,020
Go, go, go, go, go.

15545
13:08:55,320 --> 13:08:55,700
Please.

15546
13:08:57,560 --> 13:08:58,040
Please.

15547
13:08:58,700 --> 13:08:59,500
Magnio's one.

15548
13:08:59,960 --> 13:09:00,920
They're gonna rez, though.

15549
13:09:04,460 --> 13:09:05,540
Right side, Memoir.

15550
13:09:06,060 --> 13:09:06,440
He's low.

15551
13:09:06,480 --> 13:09:06,900
Did they do it?

15552
13:09:08,400 --> 13:09:09,260
Magnio's low, Magnio.

15553
13:09:09,480 --> 13:09:10,420
Oh, he's half.

15554
13:09:10,460 --> 13:09:10,880
He's half now.

15555
13:09:12,040 --> 13:09:12,420
Mag.

15556
13:09:12,560 --> 13:09:12,860
Mag.

15557
13:09:13,040 --> 13:09:13,340
Mag.

15558
13:09:13,500 --> 13:09:13,980
Mag.

15559
13:09:14,400 --> 13:09:15,180
Mag's still low.

15560
13:09:21,910 --> 13:09:22,950
Oh, my God.

15561
13:09:28,070 --> 13:09:28,590
Oh.

15562
13:09:28,690 --> 13:09:30,710
Oh, I'm low?

15563
13:09:31,270 --> 13:09:31,730
Oh.

15564
13:09:36,700 --> 13:09:38,100
He has no passive now.

15565
13:09:38,920 --> 13:09:39,300
I'm ulting this.

15566
13:09:39,400 --> 13:09:39,780
I'm ulting this.

15567
13:09:40,100 --> 13:09:42,160
Kill the Wolverine.

15568
13:09:43,100 --> 13:09:43,940
He has no passive.

15569
13:09:44,740 --> 13:09:46,320
Yeah, I'm on the Wolverine.

15570
13:09:46,540 --> 13:09:47,580
Oh, they fully backed out.

15571
13:09:47,840 --> 13:09:48,340
No passive.

15572
13:09:48,520 --> 13:09:49,020
No passive.

15573
13:09:49,200 --> 13:09:49,460
No passive.

15574
13:09:52,900 --> 13:09:54,900
I need my life.

15575
13:09:58,180 --> 13:09:59,920
Can we even contest still?

15576
13:10:02,460 --> 13:10:03,280
I don't know.

15577
13:10:03,380 --> 13:10:03,580
Maybe.

15578
13:10:06,800 --> 13:10:07,900
I froze Groot.

15579
13:10:08,000 --> 13:10:08,500
I froze Groot.

15580
13:10:10,800 --> 13:10:11,740
I touched it.

15581
13:10:11,800 --> 13:10:12,800
I touched it for one second.

15582
13:10:16,980 --> 13:10:17,520
No!

15583
13:10:21,720 --> 13:10:23,960
I can't wait for three wins, guys.

15584
13:10:24,720 --> 13:10:26,320
I can't wait.

15585
13:10:29,640 --> 13:10:30,800
I'm Luna Snow.

15586
13:10:31,080 --> 13:10:33,020
Like the moon, I shine.

15587
13:10:33,040 --> 13:10:34,140
Guys, I'm so...

15588
13:10:34,140 --> 13:10:35,340
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

15589
13:10:35,340 --> 13:10:37,460
I can't wait for three games.

15590
13:10:37,920 --> 13:10:39,560
Three games, everybody.

15591
13:10:40,060 --> 13:10:42,040
Give it up for three games.

15592
13:10:42,680 --> 13:10:43,940
We're here forever.

15593
13:10:48,920 --> 13:10:49,500
Yeah.

15594
13:10:54,600 --> 13:10:56,690
I don't know, honestly.

15595
13:10:57,730 --> 13:11:00,770
I think this guy is a Penny Parker player.

15596
13:11:02,510 --> 13:11:05,050
Which is crazy because she's not meta anymore.

15597
13:11:13,310 --> 13:11:19,750
I don't think Glizzy Muncher cares.

15598
13:11:20,670 --> 13:11:23,250
I think he's already in the G.G.

15599
13:11:23,410 --> 13:11:24,010
Go next.

15600
13:11:25,350 --> 13:11:27,510
Glizzy Muncher is already fucking over.

15601
13:11:31,970 --> 13:11:33,710
What support do I even switch to?

15602
13:11:34,910 --> 13:11:35,750
You can go Lucky.

15603
13:11:35,910 --> 13:11:36,530
You can go Adam.

15604
13:11:37,010 --> 13:11:37,790
Adam is also good.

15605
13:11:38,430 --> 13:11:39,710
You can go triple DPS.

15606
13:11:39,850 --> 13:11:40,330
You can go Namori.

15607
13:11:40,490 --> 13:11:40,710
It's good.

15608
13:11:41,370 --> 13:11:42,590
Adam will give us three runs.

15609
13:11:43,190 --> 13:11:43,510
Pretty good.

15610
13:11:44,010 --> 13:11:44,370
Adam?

15611
13:11:44,470 --> 13:11:45,110
Adam will be really good.

15612
13:11:45,190 --> 13:11:46,490
I've never played Adam.

15613
13:11:47,830 --> 13:11:48,970
I don't even play support.

15614
13:11:52,570 --> 13:11:52,970
Alright.

15615
13:11:52,970 --> 13:11:54,270
Yeah, I can play Namori.

15616
13:11:58,130 --> 13:11:59,810
Here we go.

15617
13:12:03,930 --> 13:12:04,550
Behind us.

15618
13:12:04,610 --> 13:12:05,010
Behind us.

15619
13:12:14,930 --> 13:12:16,150
I'm rolling on mag.

15620
13:12:17,330 --> 13:12:17,770
Mag.

15621
13:12:17,850 --> 13:12:18,190
Mag.

15622
13:12:18,230 --> 13:12:18,670
Mag.

15623
13:12:18,710 --> 13:12:19,090
Mag.

15624
13:12:19,150 --> 13:12:19,370
Mag.

15625
13:12:21,550 --> 13:12:21,990
Mag.

15626
13:12:22,170 --> 13:12:22,170
Mag.

15627
13:12:22,510 --> 13:12:22,710
Mag.

15628
13:12:22,910 --> 13:12:23,070
Mag.

15629
13:12:23,070 --> 13:12:23,890
Agni is still low.

15630
13:12:25,410 --> 13:12:26,010
He has no shield.

15631
13:12:28,330 --> 13:12:29,990
Agni has one.

15632
13:12:31,490 --> 13:12:32,430
I'm shooting him.

15633
13:12:33,250 --> 13:12:33,570
Mag.

15634
13:12:33,610 --> 13:12:33,830
Mag.

15635
13:12:33,950 --> 13:12:34,070
Mag.

15636
13:12:34,610 --> 13:12:35,870
I'm solo healing.

15637
13:12:37,630 --> 13:12:37,990
Pressured.

15638
13:12:38,070 --> 13:12:38,350
I'm pressured.

15639
13:12:38,530 --> 13:12:38,850
I'm pressured.

15640
13:12:39,510 --> 13:12:40,210
Ogre in.

15641
13:12:41,990 --> 13:12:42,870
Ogre in.

15642
13:12:43,570 --> 13:12:51,990
We are 20 off support ults here.

15643
13:12:54,290 --> 13:12:55,470
I have mine in two.

15644
13:12:55,570 --> 13:12:56,350
I'm going to use it now.

15645
13:12:56,650 --> 13:12:57,750
Just use it when you're in it.

15646
13:12:58,010 --> 13:12:58,170
Go.

15647
13:12:58,730 --> 13:12:58,730
Go.

15648
13:12:58,990 --> 13:12:59,350
Go.

15649
13:12:59,430 --> 13:12:59,430
Go.

15650
13:12:59,990 --> 13:13:00,690
Try and kill their Luna.

15651
13:13:04,510 --> 13:13:07,630
3, 2, 1.

15652
13:13:07,670 --> 13:13:08,310
I'm backing out.

15653
13:13:16,350 --> 13:13:16,710
Mantis.

15654
13:13:16,750 --> 13:13:16,870
Mantis.

15655
13:13:16,870 --> 13:13:16,870
Mantis.

15656
13:13:16,870 --> 13:13:17,670
They're really low.

15657
13:13:18,390 --> 13:13:19,390
Strange has ult too.

15658
13:13:21,910 --> 13:13:22,270
Wolverine.

15659
13:13:22,270 --> 13:13:22,790
Wolverine is low.

15660
13:13:23,050 --> 13:13:23,330
Wolverine is low.

15661
13:13:25,290 --> 13:13:25,810
Strange 1.

15662
13:13:25,890 --> 13:13:25,930
Strange 1.

15663
13:13:25,930 --> 13:13:26,290
Strange 1.

15664
13:13:28,630 --> 13:13:29,690
Wolverine is up top.

15665
13:13:35,910 --> 13:13:36,790
Oh my god.

15666
13:13:38,430 --> 13:13:39,270
Wolverine no cooldown.

15667
13:13:39,850 --> 13:13:40,570
Where is Wolverine?

15668
13:13:44,770 --> 13:13:46,190
Where'd he go?

15669
13:13:48,330 --> 13:13:49,830
They're probably close to 1 support ult.

15670
13:13:55,280 --> 13:13:56,860
They didn't use Mantis ult yet.

15671
13:14:02,000 --> 13:14:02,980
Oh my god.

15672
13:14:03,760 --> 13:14:05,160
Get me out of this.

15673
13:14:08,520 --> 13:14:12,800
I'm okay.

15674
13:14:21,200 --> 13:14:22,880
Yeah, it's fine.

15675
13:14:25,260 --> 13:14:26,600
It's fine.

15676
13:14:27,460 --> 13:14:28,820
It's fine.

15677
13:14:30,260 --> 13:14:33,200
We just have Wolverine, I think, and Nagamoto.

15678
13:14:36,240 --> 13:14:39,800
They used both support ults, so...

15679
13:14:39,800 --> 13:14:40,780
And we actually...

15680
13:14:41,320 --> 13:14:43,000
We'll have Luna ult back, actually.

15681
13:14:51,190 --> 13:14:52,490
He's going for I, maybe, right side.

15682
13:14:55,270 --> 13:14:56,370
Wolverine's gonna grab me, guys.

15683
13:14:56,750 --> 13:14:57,270
Oh, missed.

15684
13:15:00,530 --> 13:15:01,290
Oh my god.

15685
13:15:01,730 --> 13:15:02,230
No more health.

15686
13:15:02,370 --> 13:15:02,790
Please.

15687
13:15:04,090 --> 13:15:04,530
Please.

15688
13:15:05,830 --> 13:15:07,630
We'll use Mantis ult first if we need to.

15689
13:15:13,380 --> 13:15:14,480
Actually, I'll use it.

15690
13:15:14,500 --> 13:15:14,760
I got it.

15691
13:15:15,460 --> 13:15:15,880
Oh.

15692
13:15:18,860 --> 13:15:19,940
Gotta get Kits.

15693
13:15:20,240 --> 13:15:20,680
Gotta get Kits.

15694
13:15:22,820 --> 13:15:23,440
It's fine.

15695
13:15:23,600 --> 13:15:24,280
I'm damage boosting.

15696
13:15:24,420 --> 13:15:24,940
I'm damage boosting.

15697
13:15:25,060 --> 13:15:25,480
I'm damage boosting.

15698
13:15:26,600 --> 13:15:28,420
I'm backing to the point.

15699
13:15:29,360 --> 13:15:29,500
Sorry.

15700
13:15:30,560 --> 13:15:31,860
I just thought that...

15701
13:15:31,860 --> 13:15:34,740
Because she didn't ult instantly, so I went for it.

15702
13:15:35,820 --> 13:15:36,700
Wolverine behind us.

15703
13:15:40,040 --> 13:15:41,580
Wait, wait, he's in, he's in.

15704
13:15:43,980 --> 13:15:45,380
We still have another push here.

15705
13:15:54,320 --> 13:15:56,280
I'm putting a self flick on Starlord.

15706
13:15:56,660 --> 13:15:58,060
Wait, go, go, go, go, go!

15707
13:15:59,820 --> 13:16:01,660
I have a Magneto on us.

15708
13:16:03,100 --> 13:16:04,120
Magneto's one, Magneto's one!

15709
13:16:04,620 --> 13:16:06,220
Crit one too, crit one!

15710
13:16:07,260 --> 13:16:07,660
Oh.

15711
13:16:20,560 --> 13:16:21,320
Jesus.

15712
13:16:21,700 --> 13:16:21,840
Wait!

15713
13:16:22,060 --> 13:16:23,240
Oh, he's guy's passive.

15714
13:16:27,250 --> 13:16:28,010
Stop!

15715
13:16:30,690 --> 13:16:31,070
Stop!

15716
13:16:33,530 --> 13:16:33,910
Please.

15717
13:16:35,210 --> 13:16:36,550
Please stop.

15718
13:16:44,320 --> 13:16:46,480
I don't know if it is winnable, guys.

15719
13:16:47,380 --> 13:16:49,000
Their team seems just better.

15720
13:16:52,180 --> 13:16:52,940
Okay.

15721
13:16:55,320 --> 13:16:56,040
I'm okay.

15722
13:16:57,000 --> 13:16:57,880
I'm okay.

15723
13:16:58,500 --> 13:17:00,140
I'm not okay.

15724
13:17:01,100 --> 13:17:04,320
I think the more we're so dead, the more...

15725
13:17:05,240 --> 13:17:07,360
We're so dead, the more...

15726
13:17:20,480 --> 13:17:21,640
That's fine.

15727
13:17:25,720 --> 13:17:27,180
We'll be fine.

15728
13:17:30,400 --> 13:17:31,980
Guys, three more games, guys.

15729
13:17:31,980 --> 13:17:35,260
Three more games!

15730
13:17:36,240 --> 13:17:36,760
Wow!

15731
13:17:38,480 --> 13:17:40,520
I love Marvel Rivals!

15732
13:17:48,400 --> 13:17:50,540
What the fuck happened to her?

15733
13:17:50,800 --> 13:17:51,700
What happened to her?

15734
13:17:51,860 --> 13:17:52,740
Oh, crit's low.

15735
13:17:52,880 --> 13:17:53,720
Crit's so low.

15736
13:17:54,680 --> 13:17:57,420
We've got 20 seconds, we've got to do this.

15737
13:17:58,940 --> 13:18:00,040
I'm gonna die, guys.

15738
13:18:00,360 --> 13:18:01,480
Wait, I thought...

15739
13:18:03,640 --> 13:18:04,900
Oh, okay.

15740
13:18:05,100 --> 13:18:06,720
It's 10 seconds.

15741
13:18:08,640 --> 13:18:09,940
Mantis, why?

15742
13:18:11,260 --> 13:18:13,700
Why, Mantis?

15743
13:18:15,040 --> 13:18:17,640
Why, Mantis?

15744
13:18:18,800 --> 13:18:20,980
Mantis, you have ult!

15745
13:18:22,960 --> 13:18:23,600
What?

15746
13:18:28,120 --> 13:18:29,840
I'm just like...

15747
13:18:29,840 --> 13:18:30,480
Mantis?

15748
13:18:31,480 --> 13:18:33,940
The Mantis...

15749
13:18:35,560 --> 13:18:38,620
What happened to our Mantis?

15750
13:18:40,100 --> 13:18:43,640
The Mantis said, don't worry, king.

15751
13:18:44,380 --> 13:18:45,720
And then, that was...

15752
13:18:46,280 --> 13:18:48,560
That was our Mantis.

15753
13:18:50,120 --> 13:18:51,720
Oh my god.

15754
13:18:53,400 --> 13:18:54,880
Wait, what was...

15755
13:18:55,100 --> 13:18:57,780
Why did I thought...

15756
13:18:57,780 --> 13:18:59,720
The Mantis would be okay?

15757
13:19:00,480 --> 13:19:01,120
Why?

15758
13:19:06,760 --> 13:19:10,800
Why did he tell me, don't worry, Mantis?

15759
13:19:11,640 --> 13:19:13,220
I should have worried.

15760
13:19:13,460 --> 13:19:14,200
Guys.

15761
13:19:15,200 --> 13:19:16,740
I should have worried.

15762
13:19:31,960 --> 13:19:34,200
Oh my god.

15763
13:19:35,220 --> 13:19:36,780
Oh my god.

15764
13:19:36,960 --> 13:19:38,220
I can't believe...

15765
13:19:42,040 --> 13:19:43,980
Oh my god.

15766
13:19:44,180 --> 13:19:47,280
I don't know why he held that ult!

15767
13:19:54,540 --> 13:19:56,740
I was like, Mantis?

15768
13:19:59,120 --> 13:19:59,880
Mantis?

15769
13:20:01,300 --> 13:20:02,680
Okay, let's do it.

15770
13:20:02,700 --> 13:20:03,260
Let's go.

15771
13:20:05,020 --> 13:20:06,720
Okay, let's go.

15772
13:20:07,580 --> 13:20:08,360
Oh shit.

15773
13:20:09,280 --> 13:20:10,520
Okay, sorry.

15774
13:20:10,820 --> 13:20:12,320
If it flips to me, I'm sorry.

15775
13:20:13,880 --> 13:20:15,540
I should have flipped him.

15776
13:20:20,620 --> 13:20:22,720
I'm not okay right now.

15777
13:20:22,900 --> 13:20:23,260
I've been...

15778
13:20:24,740 --> 13:20:26,480
I've been on right now.

15779
13:20:27,700 --> 13:20:29,460
I've been on for...

15780
13:20:30,000 --> 13:20:31,080
Oh my god.

15781
13:20:31,120 --> 13:20:32,720
It's been 13 hours.

15782
13:20:34,600 --> 13:20:35,760
Were they ban Luna?

15783
13:20:35,960 --> 13:20:37,300
I'm not a one trick!

15784
13:20:37,300 --> 13:20:39,380
I literally proved that!

15785
13:20:39,760 --> 13:20:40,700
I played...

15786
13:20:40,700 --> 13:20:41,420
I've won...

15787
13:20:41,420 --> 13:20:43,500
I did plays on Adam.

15788
13:20:48,060 --> 13:20:49,560
Oh my god.

15789
13:20:51,320 --> 13:20:52,980
I think I'm gonna freak out.

15790
13:20:55,080 --> 13:20:55,960
Don't worry.

15791
13:20:57,360 --> 13:21:00,080
Then it'll be two more wins after this, right guys?

15792
13:21:00,380 --> 13:21:02,100
Two more wins.

15793
13:21:03,220 --> 13:21:06,800
Two more wins after this game, right guys?

15794
13:21:07,860 --> 13:21:09,280
The 2.5...

15795
13:21:09,280 --> 13:21:11,280
Where does the .5 come from?

15796
13:21:12,580 --> 13:21:13,520
I used...

15797
13:21:13,520 --> 13:21:14,520
I used the...

15798
13:21:14,520 --> 13:21:15,900
Gosh, I don't even know what mic I...

15799
13:21:15,900 --> 13:21:16,660
Is it a Shure...

15800
13:21:16,660 --> 13:21:17,980
It's one of the Shure mics.

15801
13:21:18,440 --> 13:21:21,820
It's the classic Shure mic when you use for streaming.

15802
13:21:22,500 --> 13:21:23,840
It's one of those.

15803
13:21:30,160 --> 13:21:31,600
My brain is...

15804
13:21:31,600 --> 13:21:33,500
Can't comprehend stuff anymore.

15805
13:21:33,620 --> 13:21:35,300
All I can think about is...

15806
13:21:35,300 --> 13:21:37,060
Is Marvel Rivals.

15807
13:21:37,360 --> 13:21:38,980
I love Marvel Rivals.

15808
13:21:39,400 --> 13:21:40,000
I should...

15809
13:21:40,000 --> 13:21:40,400
I don't know.

15810
13:21:40,700 --> 13:21:41,540
This should be on Iron Man.

15811
13:21:44,000 --> 13:21:45,640
Oh, fucking hell.

15812
13:21:45,740 --> 13:21:46,160
I forgot.

15813
13:21:46,560 --> 13:21:48,420
I'm playing against an enemy.

15814
13:21:52,380 --> 13:21:54,240
Oh my god, I missed.

15815
13:21:55,380 --> 13:21:56,080
I missed.

15816
13:21:58,840 --> 13:22:00,240
Oh my god.

15817
13:22:03,240 --> 13:22:04,380
Jesus Christ.

15818
13:22:06,660 --> 13:22:09,220
You gotta help the Iron Man if you want, by the way.

15819
13:22:11,660 --> 13:22:12,760
Oh my god.

15820
13:22:15,200 --> 13:22:16,440
There's a Hulk on us.

15821
13:22:26,960 --> 13:22:31,480
Please, I'm trying my best to help your stupid 1v1.

15822
13:22:32,700 --> 13:22:33,320
Iron Man, Iron Man.

15823
13:22:38,200 --> 13:22:38,960
I'm at top.

15824
13:22:44,190 --> 13:22:45,730
Can I have some fucking healing?

15825
13:22:51,370 --> 13:22:52,930
We have Hulk on us.

15826
13:22:53,070 --> 13:22:54,610
Hulk on me, Hulk on me, Hulk on me.

15827
13:22:57,250 --> 13:22:58,210
Stranger's low, Stranger's low.

15828
13:23:01,530 --> 13:23:02,830
Yeah, I'm in Hulk, I'm in Hulk.

15829
13:23:05,890 --> 13:23:06,670
I'm ulting this.

15830
13:23:11,990 --> 13:23:13,850
I'm on point, I'm on point with my heals.

15831
13:23:15,730 --> 13:23:16,690
Hulk behind us.

15832
13:23:17,710 --> 13:23:18,790
Hulk has ult, I think.

15833
13:23:21,430 --> 13:23:22,930
I'm dead here, I'm dead here.

15834
13:23:32,450 --> 13:23:33,550
Oh my god.

15835
13:23:36,010 --> 13:23:38,770
Was he the one that was like, I need some heals?

15836
13:23:38,930 --> 13:23:41,070
I'm like, I fucking, what do you want from me?

15837
13:23:41,810 --> 13:23:44,010
You have everything you've ever...

15838
13:23:46,050 --> 13:23:46,410
Wanted.

15839
13:23:47,990 --> 13:23:49,330
I'm gonna get D.Va, he's 1 HP.

15840
13:23:50,430 --> 13:23:51,170
He's killed his guy.

15841
13:23:51,670 --> 13:23:52,390
He's 1, he's 1.

15842
13:23:52,450 --> 13:23:53,110
Please, please, please.

15843
13:24:00,970 --> 13:24:01,930
Oh my god.

15844
13:24:02,530 --> 13:24:03,370
Where's my Iron Man?

15845
13:24:05,570 --> 13:24:06,610
Oh my god.

15846
13:24:11,470 --> 13:24:13,190
Like, what do you want from me?

15847
13:24:20,680 --> 13:24:21,560
Iron Man, Iron Man, Iron Man.

15848
13:24:21,860 --> 13:24:22,500
Iron Man, D.Va, D.Va.

15849
13:24:22,500 --> 13:24:23,460
Oh, Mega, uh...

15850
13:24:24,480 --> 13:24:26,000
I'm just looking at Luna, looking at Luna.

15851
13:24:27,340 --> 13:24:28,760
He's Gamma, Gamma, Gamma, Gamma.

15852
13:24:31,460 --> 13:24:32,700
Luna, absolutely, D.Va.

15853
13:24:35,060 --> 13:24:36,580
Left side, Wolverine left side, left side.

15854
13:24:36,640 --> 13:24:37,400
Wolverine half on left side.

15855
13:24:37,700 --> 13:24:38,380
Oh my god.

15856
13:24:41,780 --> 13:24:44,140
I can walk in with Gamma here, I'm walking Gamma, I'm walking Gamma.

15857
13:24:44,180 --> 13:24:45,680
Look, look, look, Iron Man, Iron Man, Iron Man, Iron Man.

15858
13:24:49,620 --> 13:24:52,240
I'm not in a good position, Wolf.

15859
13:24:53,000 --> 13:24:54,140
Oh my god.

15860
13:24:56,840 --> 13:24:58,280
You only have low-key heals.

15861
13:24:59,600 --> 13:25:00,800
Only low-key heals.

15862
13:25:03,140 --> 13:25:05,220
Oh my god.

15863
13:25:06,500 --> 13:25:10,360
Yeah, I was like, I can't help you guys, you guys went high ground.

15864
13:25:10,900 --> 13:25:12,300
What do I do?

15865
13:25:13,560 --> 13:25:14,640
I'm coming back now, I'm coming back.

15866
13:25:27,520 --> 13:25:28,020
Oh.

15867
13:25:28,820 --> 13:25:29,960
What do you mean?

15868
13:25:30,780 --> 13:25:35,560
You get the snowflake, that's the most healing you can ever dream of.

15869
13:25:36,320 --> 13:25:41,760
Oh wait, it's not, okay, it was our, it was our Psylocke, that's, it's our Psylocke.

15870
13:25:43,700 --> 13:25:48,060
Sorry, buddy, you're right, no, he's right, no, he's so right.

15871
13:25:49,860 --> 13:25:51,520
Okay, no, he's right.

15872
13:25:54,040 --> 13:25:56,420
No, he's right, no, he gets jack shit.

15873
13:25:58,280 --> 13:26:01,040
Nevermind, alright, three, two, one.

15874
13:26:10,040 --> 13:26:11,280
Oh my god.

15875
13:26:12,560 --> 13:26:14,320
I, okay.

15876
13:26:21,740 --> 13:26:23,040
Oh my god.

15877
13:26:25,920 --> 13:26:28,240
I'm coming back.

15878
13:26:30,600 --> 13:26:33,200
Oh my god, I'm coming back.

15879
13:26:33,400 --> 13:26:36,080
That's why I wanted to ban Mantis!

15880
13:26:38,820 --> 13:26:40,480
I got to grab, I got to grab Mantis.

15881
13:26:41,300 --> 13:26:42,180
Oh no!

15882
13:26:43,380 --> 13:26:44,200
Fucking go Mantis.

15883
13:26:46,340 --> 13:26:47,240
Alright, do you play?

15884
13:26:47,760 --> 13:26:49,520
Yes, I play Mantis, I'm gonna play Mantis.

15885
13:26:54,800 --> 13:26:57,800
I just need healing, I'm playing health packs.

15886
13:27:01,180 --> 13:27:01,860
Fuck it, man.

15887
13:27:02,800 --> 13:27:03,920
We're trying, we're healing.

15888
13:27:03,920 --> 13:27:08,560
Oh my god, our tanks are taking a fuck ton of damage, it's not just the unit deals.

15889
13:27:09,520 --> 13:27:12,560
Yeah, but I'm killing their Ironman, I'm killing their Lunar.

15890
13:27:12,720 --> 13:27:15,460
Good job, good job, you keep doing that, we'll keep doing our thing, okay?

15891
13:27:16,260 --> 13:27:18,860
Yeah, but your one thing is losing fights, apparently.

15892
13:27:19,120 --> 13:27:20,280
We're still losing fights right now.

15893
13:27:27,320 --> 13:27:29,420
Good for you, man, good for you.

15894
13:27:29,700 --> 13:27:30,700
Oh my god.

15895
13:27:34,680 --> 13:27:35,020
Bro.

15896
13:27:38,420 --> 13:27:40,240
Look at this, fuck.

15897
13:27:40,940 --> 13:27:44,920
Bro's getting knocked out, I'm so in for it.

15898
13:27:47,260 --> 13:27:47,940
But...

15899
13:27:49,980 --> 13:27:52,240
I love Marvel Rivals.

15900
13:27:53,680 --> 13:27:54,020
Oh!

15901
13:27:54,220 --> 13:27:56,380
Oh my, I don't know why I ricocheted.

15902
13:27:59,440 --> 13:28:01,320
I like ricocheted.

15903
13:28:01,600 --> 13:28:02,300
Can I get a heal?

15904
13:28:02,300 --> 13:28:05,520
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU PUNCHED ME?!

15905
13:28:13,040 --> 13:28:14,520
It worked out.

15906
13:28:15,240 --> 13:28:16,700
Everything worked out.

15907
13:28:22,150 --> 13:28:24,750
It all worked out, everybody!

15908
13:28:25,650 --> 13:28:28,250
It all worked out!

15909
13:28:30,550 --> 13:28:31,110
I don't know.

15910
13:28:32,430 --> 13:28:33,210
I don't know.

15911
13:28:33,990 --> 13:28:34,990
No more is one, no more is one.

15912
13:28:38,490 --> 13:28:38,970
We killed two.

15913
13:28:39,470 --> 13:28:40,130
We don't need it.

15914
13:28:42,550 --> 13:28:44,250
Mantis one behind, Mantis one to the left.

15915
13:28:49,130 --> 13:28:51,650
It all worked out!

15916
13:28:56,070 --> 13:28:57,810
There's a Magneto, right?

15917
13:28:57,810 --> 13:28:58,970
I'm forced,

15918
13:29:02,970 --> 13:29:04,790
I'm forced.

15919
13:29:06,510 --> 13:29:12,750
Oh, I thought you were gonna ult first, sorry.

15920
13:29:13,510 --> 13:29:14,810
I got him, I got him, I got him.

15921
13:29:16,670 --> 13:29:17,710
It's fine.

15922
13:29:18,310 --> 13:29:21,310
Oh, it's changing, changing.

15923
13:29:22,010 --> 13:29:22,310
I will help.

15924
13:29:23,230 --> 13:29:24,650
I'm coming over now.

15925
13:29:25,370 --> 13:29:29,720
Don't die, don't die, don't die.

15926
13:29:33,500 --> 13:29:35,540
I'm gonna have to ult, I have to ult.

15927
13:29:44,120 --> 13:29:46,760
I'm still alive, 3, 2, 1.

15928
13:29:47,440 --> 13:29:48,340
I froze Magneto.

15929
13:29:50,940 --> 13:29:51,840
I have my ult, I have my ult.

15930
13:29:54,840 --> 13:29:56,720
Wait, Bruce, Bruce banished, Bruce banished to your left.

15931
13:30:01,160 --> 13:30:02,060
Oh my gosh.

15932
13:30:07,570 --> 13:30:08,780
I'm looking at...

15933
13:30:11,730 --> 13:30:12,970
Jesus Christ.

15934
13:30:13,150 --> 13:30:14,430
Oh my gosh.

15935
13:30:17,190 --> 13:30:20,310
Oh my gosh, that was so stressful.

15936
13:30:23,500 --> 13:30:25,690
That was so stressful.

15937
13:30:26,490 --> 13:30:27,670
Yo, are you guys stacked?

15938
13:30:28,390 --> 13:30:29,270
No, what?

15939
13:30:29,290 --> 13:30:30,210
We're not stacked, bro.

15940
13:30:30,370 --> 13:30:31,170
We're not stacked.

15941
13:30:37,410 --> 13:30:37,970
Wait.

15942
13:30:37,970 --> 13:30:38,550
Holy fuck.

15943
13:30:40,490 --> 13:30:41,810
I hate this guy.

15944
13:30:42,490 --> 13:30:47,170
But like, in-game, in-game, I'm sure he's a lovely person outside of the game.

15945
13:30:49,290 --> 13:30:53,970
I'm pretty... he must be a lovely person outside of this video game.

15946
13:31:01,170 --> 13:31:02,650
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ult.

15947
13:31:06,130 --> 13:31:08,330
I hope you never end in Tassadar.

15948
13:31:11,150 --> 13:31:12,950
In-game, in-game, in-game.

15949
13:31:22,430 --> 13:31:24,290
I'm just warming up my legs.

15950
13:31:25,950 --> 13:31:26,710
It's good, it's good, behind.

15951
13:31:26,710 --> 13:31:26,750
Behind.

15952
13:31:39,920 --> 13:31:42,320
I'm ulting.

15953
13:31:43,460 --> 13:31:44,280
I have to reload.

15954
13:31:48,360 --> 13:31:51,020
Oh my god.

15955
13:31:51,960 --> 13:31:54,520
Oh my god.

15956
13:31:57,000 --> 13:31:58,300
That was huge.

15957
13:31:58,440 --> 13:31:59,880
That was a huge ult.

15958
13:32:00,760 --> 13:32:02,200
Where do they come from?

15959
13:32:02,300 --> 13:32:02,820
Oh, this way.

15960
13:32:02,920 --> 13:32:03,080
Okay.

15961
13:32:03,240 --> 13:32:04,900
I couldn't remember.

15962
13:32:05,620 --> 13:32:06,420
I can't tell.

15963
13:32:06,560 --> 13:32:08,880
I'm fucking directionless right now.

15964
13:32:09,860 --> 13:32:10,900
Jesus Christ.

15965
13:32:16,290 --> 13:32:16,470
How?

15966
13:32:19,370 --> 13:32:22,090
What do you mean?!

15967
13:32:24,810 --> 13:32:25,330
Pokemon.

15968
13:32:33,270 --> 13:32:34,230
No, you're not.

15969
13:32:34,370 --> 13:32:35,190
You're so healthy.

15970
13:32:36,190 --> 13:32:38,170
He did it again, but you're still healthy.

15971
13:32:46,210 --> 13:32:47,410
I have to ult.

15972
13:32:47,410 --> 13:32:48,090
I have to ult.

15973
13:32:48,510 --> 13:32:48,870
Oh.

15974
13:32:49,410 --> 13:32:49,910
I'm sorry.

15975
13:32:55,790 --> 13:32:56,590
That's fine.

15976
13:32:56,710 --> 13:32:57,250
I still...

15977
13:33:04,190 --> 13:33:05,190
Oh my god.

15978
13:33:05,190 --> 13:33:07,850
I didn't see the mantis having ult.

15979
13:33:07,970 --> 13:33:08,690
That was my bad.

15980
13:33:12,690 --> 13:33:13,650
Bro, like...

15981
13:33:13,650 --> 13:33:14,490
No, you know what?

15982
13:33:14,510 --> 13:33:17,610
No, he's a terrible person outside of this game.

15983
13:33:17,730 --> 13:33:17,970
I bet.

15984
13:33:20,270 --> 13:33:21,770
I take it all back.

15985
13:33:22,210 --> 13:33:23,930
I fucking take it all back.

15986
13:33:33,470 --> 13:33:34,970
I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving.

15987
13:33:48,050 --> 13:33:48,610
He is!

15988
13:33:48,730 --> 13:33:49,630
I know it!

15989
13:33:57,930 --> 13:33:58,810
I'm very close to you.

15990
13:34:04,850 --> 13:34:05,830
I don't want to walk out main.

15991
13:34:05,930 --> 13:34:06,670
I do not want to walk out main.

15992
13:34:07,190 --> 13:34:07,710
What's up?

15993
13:34:07,790 --> 13:34:08,010
What's up?

15994
13:34:11,030 --> 13:34:11,430
Wolverine.

15995
13:34:11,470 --> 13:34:12,170
Watch Wolverine.

15996
13:34:17,970 --> 13:34:22,770
I need my cloak.

15997
13:34:24,690 --> 13:34:26,510
I have Wolverine behind me.

15998
13:34:27,930 --> 13:34:28,770
Wolverine is on support.

15999
13:34:28,890 --> 13:34:29,610
Wolverine is on support.

16000
13:34:30,150 --> 13:34:30,490
Heal me.

16001
13:34:30,630 --> 13:34:30,970
Heal me.

16002
13:34:31,210 --> 13:34:31,810
Strange one.

16003
13:34:31,930 --> 13:34:32,310
Strange one.

16004
13:34:32,350 --> 13:34:33,530
Wolverine is still on support.

16005
13:34:33,530 --> 13:34:34,250
He needs damage boost.

16006
13:34:41,690 --> 13:34:46,170
Oh my god.

16007
13:34:51,190 --> 13:34:55,570
Okay, I'm heading over.

16008
13:34:56,570 --> 13:34:57,190
I'm gonna...

16009
13:34:57,190 --> 13:34:58,110
I'm heading over.

16010
13:35:00,170 --> 13:35:00,470
I'm coming.

16011
13:35:03,570 --> 13:35:05,250
Five seconds.

16012
13:35:05,250 --> 13:35:06,070
Four.

16013
13:35:06,550 --> 13:35:07,390
Three.

16014
13:35:07,930 --> 13:35:08,310
Two.

16015
13:35:08,630 --> 13:35:09,010
One.

16016
13:35:19,890 --> 13:35:22,430
I'm trying to keep our Mantis up.

16017
13:35:26,610 --> 13:35:28,530
I have Wolverine on me.

16018
13:35:33,120 --> 13:35:34,020
Please, I'm on you.

16019
13:35:34,760 --> 13:35:36,180
Please walk out.

16020
13:35:38,440 --> 13:35:40,120
Oh my god.

16021
13:35:42,780 --> 13:35:46,740
I don't know if we know how to play healer, but I don't think we do.

16022
13:35:49,300 --> 13:35:50,960
I've been listening to you guys.

16023
13:35:52,420 --> 13:35:53,260
It's okay.

16024
13:35:55,460 --> 13:35:58,960
Oh my god, how is this a stack?

16025
13:35:58,960 --> 13:36:02,320
Oh my god.

16026
13:36:05,430 --> 13:36:07,490
Holy shit.

16027
13:36:08,550 --> 13:36:09,090
Oh my

16028
13:36:12,860 --> 13:36:18,060
god.

16029
13:36:37,510 --> 13:36:41,550
It sounds like something actually.

16030
13:36:41,850 --> 13:36:42,910
I need a note.

16031
13:36:43,710 --> 13:36:44,950
I need a note.

16032
13:36:45,170 --> 13:36:46,350
I need... what was his name?

16033
13:36:46,470 --> 13:36:46,950
Nubs?

16034
13:36:46,950 --> 13:36:50,890
In front of six... seven thousand people.

16035
13:36:54,910 --> 13:36:56,110
This guy.

16036
13:36:56,330 --> 13:36:57,790
No, what was his name?

16037
13:36:58,070 --> 13:36:59,450
Fuck yeah, I need a note.

16038
13:37:00,390 --> 13:37:01,550
I need a note.

16039
13:37:01,970 --> 13:37:02,670
Nubs.

16040
13:37:03,310 --> 13:37:05,590
You sound like you have no friends.

16041
13:37:09,150 --> 13:37:10,200
You actually...

16042
13:37:10,550 --> 13:37:11,550
Oh yeah.

16043
13:37:27,940 --> 13:37:28,900
What?

16044
13:37:29,060 --> 13:37:29,560
Wait, let me see.

16045
13:37:30,080 --> 13:37:31,060
Oh, I don't have...

16046
13:37:32,300 --> 13:37:32,780
Okay.

16047
13:37:33,600 --> 13:37:38,160
Wait, maybe we should get a DPS third.

16048
13:37:38,720 --> 13:37:48,140
Oh my god.

16049
13:37:48,960 --> 13:37:51,440
Bro, my healer's stuck.

16050
13:37:51,520 --> 13:37:53,140
Oh my god.

16051
13:37:58,680 --> 13:38:00,200
I hope...

16052
13:38:00,200 --> 13:38:03,180
I hope he knows I'm a streamer.

16053
13:38:03,640 --> 13:38:05,060
And then...

16054
13:38:05,060 --> 13:38:09,580
Have a nice day when he reads the chat history.

16055
13:38:14,900 --> 13:38:16,700
I hope he has a great day.

16056
13:38:25,040 --> 13:38:26,540
I hope he has a great day.

16057
13:38:26,540 --> 13:38:26,560
Bro.

16058
13:38:27,780 --> 13:38:28,900
I hope...

16059
13:38:41,810 --> 13:38:43,110
Oh my god.

16060
13:38:43,170 --> 13:38:46,610
And then he's like, just top us off.

16061
13:38:46,750 --> 13:38:48,030
Just top us off.

16062
13:38:48,230 --> 13:38:48,790
Top me off.

16063
13:38:48,950 --> 13:38:49,590
And then I could...

16064
13:38:49,590 --> 13:38:52,290
And then he runs straight into damage.

16065
13:38:52,970 --> 13:38:54,770
How do we top that off?

16066
13:38:55,890 --> 13:38:58,610
And then he runs away from us.

16067
13:39:01,450 --> 13:39:02,470
Just like, yeah.

16068
13:39:02,630 --> 13:39:03,250
Wait, okay.

16069
13:39:03,530 --> 13:39:05,310
Oh, did Mac actually got off?

16070
13:39:05,430 --> 13:39:06,410
Oh, he climbed a bit.

16071
13:39:07,650 --> 13:39:11,090
No, I know Dosu is playing right now.

16072
13:39:13,350 --> 13:39:14,310
Let me see.

16073
13:39:17,130 --> 13:39:18,410
Oh my god.

16074
13:39:20,730 --> 13:39:21,330
He's like...

16075
13:39:21,330 --> 13:39:23,290
Wolverine on us with heal me.

16076
13:39:23,430 --> 13:39:24,190
He's like...

16077
13:39:24,190 --> 13:39:27,570
Me and the other healer was like, Wolverine's on us.

16078
13:39:27,710 --> 13:39:30,650
And then he's like, where's my heals?

16079
13:39:30,910 --> 13:39:32,770
And I'm like, I don't fucking know.

16080
13:39:32,910 --> 13:39:36,430
We're getting chased by Wolverine.

16081
13:39:39,090 --> 13:39:42,330
It's not like we didn't communicate it either.

16082
13:39:42,330 --> 13:39:43,070
Like...

16083
13:39:45,430 --> 13:39:55,340
The fact that both me and the other support communicated that we were getting dived and nobody...

16084
13:39:55,890 --> 13:39:57,350
Like, he didn't care.

16085
13:40:02,810 --> 13:40:04,990
That guy is actually not real.

16086
13:40:05,850 --> 13:40:07,670
He was so not real.

16087
13:40:08,290 --> 13:40:09,530
Holy shit.

16088
13:40:12,110 --> 13:40:13,750
He's like, why did you...

16089
13:40:13,750 --> 13:40:14,790
I was like, I'm sorry.

16090
13:40:14,790 --> 13:40:17,570
I didn't see the Mantis at all.

16091
13:40:17,810 --> 13:40:20,870
I literally ulted because I thought we needed it.

16092
13:40:22,130 --> 13:40:23,990
I was like, oh shit.

16093
13:40:24,950 --> 13:40:27,510
Didn't see the fucking Mantis needing the ult.

16094
13:40:36,920 --> 13:40:37,620
He is real.

16095
13:40:37,660 --> 13:40:39,100
He is real in my heart.

16096
13:40:39,240 --> 13:40:40,840
I hope any other people...

16097
13:40:40,840 --> 13:40:46,840
I hope everybody that sees this guy in my queue in their games laugh at him.

16098
13:40:47,540 --> 13:40:48,500
But like laugh...

16099
13:40:48,500 --> 13:40:49,600
Sorry, not laugh at him.

16100
13:40:50,160 --> 13:40:51,440
Laugh with him.

16101
13:40:54,540 --> 13:40:57,520
I hope we all laugh with him and have a...

16102
13:40:58,280 --> 13:41:00,740
If we ever see that guy...

16103
13:41:02,180 --> 13:41:07,300
If any of you guys see that guy, I hope you all laugh with him.

16104
13:41:08,180 --> 13:41:10,580
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

16105
13:41:13,120 --> 13:41:14,140
I'm Luna Snow.

16106
13:41:14,400 --> 13:41:17,280
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

16107
13:41:24,030 --> 13:41:26,810
Where is ToeKeeperLover69?

16108
13:41:28,290 --> 13:41:30,090
I'm banning Hawkeye, bro.

16109
13:41:30,290 --> 13:41:31,130
I can't.

16110
13:41:32,690 --> 13:41:34,030
Why would you ban Luna?

16111
13:41:34,890 --> 13:41:36,950
Get rid of Hawkeye first.

16112
13:41:40,900 --> 13:41:45,280
Complaining about heroes when we have an Ironman and the Snowflake always has to go to the...

16113
13:41:45,280 --> 13:41:45,660
I swear...

16114
13:41:45,660 --> 13:41:46,860
Bro, I actually just like...

16115
13:41:46,860 --> 13:41:54,460
The fact that you chose Luna and chose 20% and now Hawkeye isn't banned or Hela isn't banned is going to cause me an aneurysm.

16116
13:41:54,500 --> 13:41:56,440
And then he bans Hela.

16117
13:41:57,240 --> 13:41:59,960
Can you stop voting for whatever you want?

16118
13:42:02,760 --> 13:42:05,400
He's going to ban Hela again, which isn't the worst thing.

16119
13:42:05,480 --> 13:42:06,480
But then we play against Hawkeye.

16120
13:42:08,600 --> 13:42:09,880
Oh, thank God.

16121
13:42:10,920 --> 13:42:11,960
I'm going to avoid this guy.

16122
13:42:17,840 --> 13:42:19,480
I'm going to freak out.

16123
13:42:20,260 --> 13:42:22,860
I'm going to freaking freak out to this guy.

16124
13:42:23,020 --> 13:42:25,520
I'm going to freak out.

16125
13:42:31,370 --> 13:42:32,810
Everything will be okay.

16126
13:42:37,110 --> 13:42:39,150
Everything will be okay, guys.

16127
13:42:39,370 --> 13:42:41,030
Everything will be okay.

16128
13:42:41,910 --> 13:42:42,890
Two games!

16129
13:42:43,010 --> 13:42:43,510
Three games!

16130
13:42:43,630 --> 13:42:44,410
Oh, I'm at three games.

16131
13:42:44,490 --> 13:42:45,330
No, four games.

16132
13:42:45,490 --> 13:42:45,830
Fuck!

16133
13:42:49,080 --> 13:42:50,720
Alright, four games.

16134
13:42:52,400 --> 13:42:52,940
Alright.

16135
13:42:58,850 --> 13:43:01,530
Guys, I was going to settle with 150.

16136
13:43:01,850 --> 13:43:02,510
What happened?

16137
13:43:03,110 --> 13:43:04,170
Okay, 130.

16138
13:43:06,510 --> 13:43:08,370
I'll settle for 130.

16139
13:43:13,330 --> 13:43:18,510
Bro does a demon ban and then picks his negative win rate DPS.

16140
13:43:18,730 --> 13:43:19,830
Did he look?

16141
13:43:21,190 --> 13:43:26,550
Bro, he already looked up minions that fast?

16142
13:43:27,810 --> 13:43:31,210
Oh my God, that's actually crazy.

16143
13:43:32,410 --> 13:43:36,450
He already looked them up on a fucking tracker.

16144
13:43:37,510 --> 13:43:39,110
That's insane.

16145
13:43:40,170 --> 13:43:42,450
Oh my God.

16146
13:43:44,910 --> 13:43:46,450
That's so funny.

16147
13:43:46,770 --> 13:43:48,950
That's actually so funny.

16148
13:43:52,610 --> 13:43:53,930
Okay, let's EU.

16149
13:43:54,250 --> 13:43:57,510
I got to be sure what fucking area I'm at.

16150
13:43:59,330 --> 13:44:00,990
Oh, I slept him.

16151
13:44:06,190 --> 13:44:08,070
Oh, both tanks are down.

16152
13:44:14,360 --> 13:44:15,740
Oh, that's cool.

16153
13:44:16,000 --> 13:44:16,640
Yes, we can EU.

16154
13:44:16,780 --> 13:44:17,100
Okay.

16155
13:44:18,660 --> 13:44:21,920
Why did both my DPS...

16156
13:44:21,920 --> 13:44:24,480
Both my DPS let him...

16157
13:44:24,480 --> 13:44:25,140
Oh my God.

16158
13:44:25,140 --> 13:44:25,420
Okay.

16159
13:44:26,200 --> 13:44:26,800
I'm okay.

16160
13:44:28,340 --> 13:44:29,440
Oh, that's a good one.

16161
13:44:32,420 --> 13:44:33,580
Jesus Christ.

16162
13:44:39,030 --> 13:44:40,190
That was strange.

16163
13:44:42,350 --> 13:44:43,830
Oh, this is bad.

16164
13:44:45,410 --> 13:44:47,070
Wait, there's a lower map.

16165
13:44:51,330 --> 13:44:52,570
Oh my God.

16166
13:44:57,270 --> 13:44:59,010
Oh my God.

16167
13:44:59,390 --> 13:45:01,050
What do I do here?

16168
13:45:05,090 --> 13:45:06,270
Oh my...

16169
13:45:06,270 --> 13:45:09,650
Okay, but they stared at me while I was sleeping.

16170
13:45:09,650 --> 13:45:13,410
Why didn't anybody wake me up?

16171
13:45:14,830 --> 13:45:16,050
I don't understand.

16172
13:45:16,390 --> 13:45:19,230
They literally watched me like fall asleep.

16173
13:45:19,390 --> 13:45:20,950
Oh my God.

16174
13:45:21,050 --> 13:45:22,830
Like, I don't know what you want me to do there.

16175
13:45:23,350 --> 13:45:23,830
I...

16176
13:45:23,830 --> 13:45:25,350
Oh my God.

16177
13:45:25,390 --> 13:45:25,630
Okay.

16178
13:45:25,950 --> 13:45:27,450
I don't know what you want me to...

16179
13:45:27,450 --> 13:45:27,770
Guys.

16180
13:45:28,150 --> 13:45:29,630
Guys, I might be...

16181
13:45:29,630 --> 13:45:30,530
Oh no.

16182
13:45:32,390 --> 13:45:33,670
Oh no.

16183
13:45:35,350 --> 13:45:37,890
This is not looking so good, guys.

16184
13:45:37,890 --> 13:45:38,890
This is...

16185
13:45:39,950 --> 13:45:40,930
I stunned him.

16186
13:45:41,130 --> 13:45:41,650
He's asleep.

16187
13:45:52,650 --> 13:45:53,110
Yeah,

16188
13:45:56,490 --> 13:45:56,970
I can touch.

16189
13:45:59,570 --> 13:46:02,950
Alright, we'll settle for a 100.

16190
13:46:03,050 --> 13:46:03,950
You're right, guys.

16191
13:46:04,090 --> 13:46:05,010
I'm gonna come to touch.

16192
13:46:05,130 --> 13:46:06,130
You're so right.

16193
13:46:06,130 --> 13:46:06,750
I'll...

16194
13:46:06,750 --> 13:46:08,210
You're so right.

16195
13:46:08,290 --> 13:46:09,890
Let me settle for a 100.

16196
13:46:10,950 --> 13:46:12,370
You're so right.

16197
13:46:12,530 --> 13:46:13,190
We'll...

16198
13:46:13,190 --> 13:46:14,390
We'll...

16199
13:46:14,390 --> 13:46:16,530
You're so fucking right, guys.

16200
13:46:26,970 --> 13:46:28,510
There's a change behind us.

16201
13:46:36,510 --> 13:46:37,670
I'm on Adam.

16202
13:46:43,750 --> 13:46:44,510
Alright.

16203
13:46:46,450 --> 13:46:47,430
There's a Psylocke.

16204
13:46:47,650 --> 13:46:48,570
I'm alive.

16205
13:46:49,510 --> 13:46:50,670
I need help with Psylocke.

16206
13:46:52,390 --> 13:46:53,850
Oh my God.

16207
13:46:53,930 --> 13:46:55,450
I needed help with Psylocke.

16208
13:47:01,100 --> 13:47:02,060
Oh my...

16209
13:47:02,060 --> 13:47:03,240
I walked backwards, guys.

16210
13:47:03,340 --> 13:47:04,240
Did you guys see that?

16211
13:47:06,940 --> 13:47:07,580
Oh my God.

16212
13:47:07,620 --> 13:47:07,880
Please.

16213
13:47:08,660 --> 13:47:09,800
You're so healthy.

16214
13:47:11,220 --> 13:47:12,620
You're so healthy.

16215
13:47:14,720 --> 13:47:15,320
Wolverine.

16216
13:47:15,620 --> 13:47:16,220
Wolverine, one.

16217
13:47:22,740 --> 13:47:23,740
It's okay.

16218
13:47:25,640 --> 13:47:26,800
Let's settle with a 100.

16219
13:47:26,980 --> 13:47:28,240
I'm fucking ready to settle.

16220
13:47:28,640 --> 13:47:30,820
I'm ready to settle, guys.

16221
13:47:31,840 --> 13:47:33,340
I'm so ready to settle.

16222
13:47:36,820 --> 13:47:39,400
I have to use this.

16223
13:47:44,790 --> 13:47:45,810
Strange hatch.

16224
13:47:49,160 --> 13:47:52,000
Okay, we lost our other DPS.

16225
13:47:53,320 --> 13:47:53,820
Alright.

16226
13:47:54,520 --> 13:47:55,360
I'm backing up.

16227
13:47:58,320 --> 13:47:59,500
Oh, they're portaling.

16228
13:48:00,120 --> 13:48:00,200
They're going to portal.

16229
13:48:00,660 --> 13:48:01,160
They're going to portal.

16230
13:48:01,280 --> 13:48:01,820
We're spawning, guys.

16231
13:48:02,720 --> 13:48:03,440
We gotta get out.

16232
13:48:07,860 --> 13:48:08,620
I'm stuck.

16233
13:48:17,420 --> 13:48:18,640
We can get out left side.

16234
13:48:19,880 --> 13:48:20,580
We need to get out.

16235
13:48:20,860 --> 13:48:21,240
Okay.

16236
13:48:21,600 --> 13:48:22,140
I'm too thick.

16237
13:48:26,380 --> 13:48:26,980
Wolverine, you have.

16238
13:48:28,000 --> 13:48:29,260
Oh my God.

16239
13:48:29,340 --> 13:48:29,720
Wolverine, you have.

16240
13:48:31,080 --> 13:48:31,640
Wolverine, you got.

16241
13:48:34,260 --> 13:48:36,570
I don't know what's going on anymore.

16242
13:48:42,860 --> 13:48:43,520
Please!

16243
13:48:44,160 --> 13:48:46,040
I don't know what's going on.

16244
13:48:47,260 --> 13:48:49,000
What do I do?

16245
13:48:52,120 --> 13:48:52,780
Okay.

16246
13:48:54,900 --> 13:48:56,360
This team doesn't look so great.

16247
13:48:56,620 --> 13:48:59,360
This team doesn't look so great.

16248
13:49:03,020 --> 13:49:04,220
Oh my God.

16249
13:49:07,180 --> 13:49:08,620
Guys, this...

16250
13:49:09,480 --> 13:49:12,480
This team is not looking so ideal.

16251
13:49:12,740 --> 13:49:13,320
I feel.

16252
13:49:15,480 --> 13:49:16,880
My team is...

16253
13:49:16,880 --> 13:49:18,580
It's not even me anymore.

16254
13:49:19,200 --> 13:49:19,980
It's not.

16255
13:49:24,980 --> 13:49:27,600
It's just not even me anymore.

16256
13:49:27,980 --> 13:49:30,580
No, we're selling for a hundred at this point.

16257
13:49:30,760 --> 13:49:32,940
I'm fucking selling for a hundred.

16258
13:49:33,980 --> 13:49:34,780
I'm ending.

16259
13:49:34,940 --> 13:49:38,100
If we get back a hundred points, at least it's positive.

16260
13:49:38,800 --> 13:49:40,240
Then we'll go again.

16261
13:49:40,320 --> 13:49:41,940
All over again.

16262
13:49:44,340 --> 13:49:47,800
Then we'll do it all over again.

16263
13:49:49,680 --> 13:49:50,800
Later today.

16264
13:49:54,220 --> 13:49:55,720
Of course I'm still on Rivals.

16265
13:49:55,880 --> 13:49:56,660
I love Rivals.

16266
13:49:58,540 --> 13:49:59,100
Yippee!

16267
13:50:03,100 --> 13:50:04,440
I love Rivals.

16268
13:50:04,860 --> 13:50:06,340
Oh, we have a Jeff now.

16269
13:50:06,800 --> 13:50:07,380
It's over.

16270
13:50:09,620 --> 13:50:10,380
We have...

16271
13:50:10,380 --> 13:50:11,820
Oh my God.

16272
13:50:12,020 --> 13:50:13,720
What happened to our team?

16273
13:50:14,840 --> 13:50:21,120
What happened to our team?

16274
13:50:22,180 --> 13:50:23,400
What happened?

16275
13:50:24,340 --> 13:50:26,240
Why do we have a Widow?

16276
13:50:31,490 --> 13:50:33,550
I don't know what happened to them.

16277
13:50:34,850 --> 13:50:35,730
Nice.

16278
13:50:40,070 --> 13:50:40,950
Unlucky.

16279
13:50:45,920 --> 13:50:47,580
That's so unlucky.

16280
13:50:54,000 --> 13:50:58,220
Oh my God, I can't even do anything about it.

16281
13:51:01,160 --> 13:51:02,820
Oh my God, we did it!

16282
13:51:02,880 --> 13:51:04,460
We killed somebody!

16283
13:51:05,620 --> 13:51:06,940
Let's go!

16284
13:51:09,060 --> 13:51:10,180
Let's go!

16285
13:51:10,180 --> 13:51:12,000
Oh my God.

16286
13:51:12,060 --> 13:51:13,500
I don't know what you expected there.

16287
13:51:13,960 --> 13:51:16,000
But definitely not enough healing.

16288
13:51:18,040 --> 13:51:20,180
Oh my God, we're doing...

16289
13:51:21,380 --> 13:51:22,520
We can do it.

16290
13:51:22,560 --> 13:51:23,780
I'm not even gonna shoot anymore.

16291
13:51:24,080 --> 13:51:25,960
I'm just gonna stay in this cart.

16292
13:51:27,040 --> 13:51:27,360
Yay.

16293
13:51:33,700 --> 13:51:34,320
What?

16294
13:51:34,400 --> 13:51:35,320
How'd that hit?

16295
13:51:37,540 --> 13:51:42,160
I literally heard the sound of it hitting his fucking face.

16296
13:51:43,600 --> 13:51:45,780
Oh my God.

16297
13:51:49,320 --> 13:51:52,320
I swear to God, I heard...

16298
13:51:53,160 --> 13:51:54,880
I heard it hit...

16299
13:51:54,880 --> 13:51:55,760
Oh my God, please.

16300
13:51:58,100 --> 13:52:00,400
Wait, what?

16301
13:52:01,080 --> 13:52:01,640
Oh.

16302
13:52:06,530 --> 13:52:08,290
Oh my God, this guy's one.

16303
13:52:13,130 --> 13:52:14,170
I don't know.

16304
13:52:15,650 --> 13:52:16,930
Oh my God, I'm fucking...

16305
13:52:17,490 --> 13:52:18,650
I'm going in.

16306
13:52:18,830 --> 13:52:20,690
I'm going... I'm not even gonna comm too.

16307
13:52:21,490 --> 13:52:22,950
I'm fucking going in.

16308
13:52:23,010 --> 13:52:24,450
I'm fucking beating him up.

16309
13:52:27,530 --> 13:52:29,090
Oh my God.

16310
13:52:29,890 --> 13:52:30,390
He missed.

16311
13:52:30,390 --> 13:52:34,270
I'm gonna start fucking beating him up.

16312
13:52:36,810 --> 13:52:39,310
None of them deserve damage boost now.

16313
13:52:45,080 --> 13:52:47,920
Oh my God, you...

16314
13:52:48,740 --> 13:52:49,640
There we go.

16315
13:52:50,240 --> 13:52:51,100
What is this?

16316
13:52:51,280 --> 13:52:52,500
What is this game?

16317
13:52:55,720 --> 13:52:56,840
What is this game?

16318
13:52:57,700 --> 13:52:59,200
What is this fucking game?

16319
13:53:04,240 --> 13:53:05,320
What is this?

16320
13:53:05,460 --> 13:53:06,180
Get out!

16321
13:53:08,340 --> 13:53:10,980
I am the damage at this.

16322
13:53:12,080 --> 13:53:13,280
I'm just...

16323
13:53:13,280 --> 13:53:14,440
Alright, it's fine.

16324
13:53:15,800 --> 13:53:16,400
Why?

16325
13:53:16,620 --> 13:53:17,480
Why did you...

16326
13:53:17,480 --> 13:53:19,380
Why did you peek, squirrel girl?

16327
13:53:19,920 --> 13:53:21,680
You're not gonna live...

16328
13:53:21,680 --> 13:53:22,660
Alright, whatever.

16329
13:53:22,840 --> 13:53:23,220
Fuck it.

16330
13:53:23,300 --> 13:53:24,500
I don't care enough.

16331
13:53:25,040 --> 13:53:26,020
I don't care enough.

16332
13:53:30,530 --> 13:53:31,810
He's opening a portal, guys.

16333
13:53:32,270 --> 13:53:32,750
We're TPing.

16334
13:53:32,850 --> 13:53:33,490
We're TPing.

16335
13:53:33,530 --> 13:53:34,110
We're TPing.

16336
13:53:34,270 --> 13:53:34,950
We're teleporting.

16337
13:53:36,530 --> 13:53:37,130
Yippee.

16338
13:53:39,650 --> 13:53:40,910
All of you do something.

16339
13:53:47,060 --> 13:53:48,240
Stand near me.

16340
13:53:48,460 --> 13:53:49,820
Stand near me or I die.

16341
13:53:50,200 --> 13:53:51,120
Stand... I...

16342
13:53:52,880 --> 13:53:53,680
I...

16343
13:53:53,680 --> 13:53:54,420
Okay.

16344
13:53:59,240 --> 13:54:00,040
Okay.

16345
13:54:06,920 --> 13:54:07,820
I don't...

16346
13:54:07,820 --> 13:54:09,380
I don't know what that was.

16347
13:54:09,700 --> 13:54:10,280
I...

16348
13:54:10,280 --> 13:54:11,160
I don't...

16349
13:54:12,660 --> 13:54:13,460
I...

16350
13:54:13,460 --> 13:54:18,460
I don't know if he cancelled my ult, but what the fuck was that?

16351
13:54:22,930 --> 13:54:23,710
It's okay.

16352
13:54:24,610 --> 13:54:26,210
Everything is fine.

16353
13:54:31,950 --> 13:54:32,710
He's asleep.

16354
13:54:34,430 --> 13:54:35,210
Okay.

16355
13:54:35,610 --> 13:54:36,350
There we go.

16356
13:54:36,910 --> 13:54:37,590
It's okay.

16357
13:54:39,950 --> 13:54:40,730
It's...

16358
13:54:41,450 --> 13:54:42,210
It's alright.

16359
13:54:42,970 --> 13:54:45,910
Sometimes some games are just...

16360
13:54:45,910 --> 13:54:46,690
Unwinnable.

16361
13:54:46,690 --> 13:54:49,090
It's just I accepted it.

16362
13:54:50,750 --> 13:54:53,690
I blame our guy for fucking selecting...

16363
13:54:54,650 --> 13:54:55,890
That our guy...

16364
13:54:55,890 --> 13:55:00,590
Our guy for selecting a ban on the 25% ban.

16365
13:55:01,690 --> 13:55:03,130
Jesus Christ.

16366
13:55:03,330 --> 13:55:04,450
What the fuck?

16367
13:55:06,690 --> 13:55:08,310
What is going...

16368
13:55:08,310 --> 13:55:09,670
What is going on?

16369
13:55:09,990 --> 13:55:11,270
Where's my team?

16370
13:55:11,390 --> 13:55:11,810
That was strange.

16371
13:55:14,810 --> 13:55:15,610
What?

16372
13:55:17,690 --> 13:55:18,970
What's going on?

16373
13:55:19,010 --> 13:55:21,770
I don't even know what's going on anymore.

16374
13:55:23,070 --> 13:55:23,790
I...

16375
13:55:23,790 --> 13:55:27,190
Oh my god.

16376
13:55:29,850 --> 13:55:30,350
He's rezzing.

16377
13:55:31,030 --> 13:55:31,970
What is...

16378
13:55:31,970 --> 13:55:32,530
Oh nice.

16379
13:55:32,710 --> 13:55:32,950
Cool.

16380
13:55:34,530 --> 13:55:34,890
Cool.

16381
13:55:37,610 --> 13:55:38,330
I...

16382
13:55:38,330 --> 13:55:39,210
I...

16383
13:55:39,210 --> 13:55:40,590
There was nothing I could do.

16384
13:55:43,570 --> 13:55:44,970
You know...

16385
13:55:44,970 --> 13:55:46,220
Some games are just...

16386
13:55:47,910 --> 13:55:48,450
Unwinnable.

16387
13:55:48,790 --> 13:55:50,670
And then you just gotta watch it happen.

16388
13:55:56,650 --> 13:55:58,030
You just... There's nothing else you can do.

16389
13:55:59,030 --> 13:56:00,630
There's nothing else you can do.

16390
13:56:00,990 --> 13:56:01,870
That's just it.

16391
13:56:03,330 --> 13:56:04,870
You think that...

16392
13:56:04,870 --> 13:56:06,070
Oh, there we go.

16393
13:56:07,410 --> 13:56:08,750
Please don't eat me.

16394
13:56:08,890 --> 13:56:09,410
Please.

16395
13:56:10,090 --> 13:56:11,030
I beg of you.

16396
13:56:12,370 --> 13:56:12,910
Please.

16397
13:56:16,710 --> 13:56:17,250
Please.

16398
13:56:18,130 --> 13:56:19,570
Who did he...

16399
13:56:19,570 --> 13:56:20,990
I beg of you.

16400
13:56:25,070 --> 13:56:26,650
I don't know, man.

16401
13:56:27,470 --> 13:56:29,050
I don't know, man.

16402
13:56:30,490 --> 13:56:31,430
I don't know.

16403
13:56:32,950 --> 13:56:33,390
I...

16404
13:56:33,390 --> 13:56:35,350
I don't know, guys.

16405
13:56:37,670 --> 13:56:38,830
Oh, yay.

16406
13:56:39,150 --> 13:56:40,310
Bogr, man.

16407
13:56:42,490 --> 13:56:43,890
Bogr, actually.

16408
13:56:44,630 --> 13:56:46,310
Bogr, man.

16409
13:56:56,540 --> 13:56:57,460
Tip him.

16410
13:56:57,700 --> 13:56:58,540
What the fuck?

16411
13:56:58,680 --> 13:56:58,900
No!

16412
13:57:02,690 --> 13:57:04,050
Oh my god.

16413
13:57:05,210 --> 13:57:05,570
Bogr...

16414
13:57:05,930 --> 13:57:06,430
I...

16415
13:57:06,430 --> 13:57:08,110
I heard the mad...

16416
13:57:08,110 --> 13:57:08,490
I...

16417
13:57:08,490 --> 13:57:10,590
I heard the tilt from Bogr.

16418
13:57:11,370 --> 13:57:13,430
Bogr has had enough.

16419
13:57:13,790 --> 13:57:15,250
I heard it.

16420
13:57:15,530 --> 13:57:17,430
He tilted right there.

16421
13:57:19,930 --> 13:57:20,950
I heard him.

16422
13:57:21,010 --> 13:57:22,070
He was like...

16423
13:57:22,070 --> 13:57:22,690
Oh, man.

16424
13:57:22,690 --> 13:57:24,690
He's actually freaking...

16425
13:57:24,690 --> 13:57:25,570
Guys, I think...

16426
13:57:27,310 --> 13:57:28,690
That poor man.

16427
13:57:28,810 --> 13:57:30,610
Oh my god, we should've stopped at 100.

16428
13:57:30,890 --> 13:57:32,670
Why didn't I settle at 130?

16429
13:57:33,230 --> 13:57:36,410
Why didn't I settle at 130?

16430
13:57:38,210 --> 13:57:39,450
I'm down!

16431
13:57:39,590 --> 13:57:41,190
I can't settle now!

16432
13:57:41,350 --> 13:57:42,430
Because I'm even!

16433
13:57:43,930 --> 13:57:48,230
I cannot settle now that we're even score.

16434
13:57:52,470 --> 13:57:54,370
So many hours.

16435
13:57:59,890 --> 13:58:00,850
It's alright.

16436
13:58:02,030 --> 13:58:03,030
It's okay.

16437
13:58:05,170 --> 13:58:06,610
Maybe we can get...

16438
13:58:06,610 --> 13:58:08,970
Wait, is Dosu with anybody?

16439
13:58:09,230 --> 13:58:09,890
I'll check.

16440
13:58:10,570 --> 13:58:10,870
I don't know.

16441
13:58:10,890 --> 13:58:12,190
He usually plays with people.

16442
13:58:12,550 --> 13:58:13,150
So I don't know.

16443
13:58:14,490 --> 13:58:15,650
I can't tell.

16444
13:58:19,720 --> 13:58:21,220
Let me double check.

16445
13:58:21,480 --> 13:58:22,540
I could get a third.

16446
13:58:23,620 --> 13:58:25,100
Alright, it's...

16447
13:58:25,100 --> 13:58:26,400
It's tracking time.

16448
13:58:27,660 --> 13:58:29,300
Oh, he's playing with his team.

16449
13:58:29,740 --> 13:58:30,340
Wait, no!

16450
13:58:31,320 --> 13:58:32,560
Oh yeah, he's playing with...

16451
13:58:32,560 --> 13:58:33,780
Is he playing with his team right now?

16452
13:58:34,140 --> 13:58:35,000
Oh, they're playing...

16453
13:58:35,000 --> 13:58:36,440
They're in the tournament right now.

16454
13:58:38,660 --> 13:58:39,100
That's...

16455
13:58:39,100 --> 13:58:39,860
Guys, I don't think...

16456
13:58:40,700 --> 13:58:42,000
They're actually in a...

16457
13:58:42,000 --> 13:58:43,780
He's actually in a tournament right now.

16458
13:58:48,840 --> 13:58:50,380
Like, get out of that tournament.

16459
13:58:50,700 --> 13:58:52,540
It doesn't matter as much right now.

16460
13:58:53,080 --> 13:58:54,900
This is definitely more important.

16461
13:58:59,690 --> 13:59:00,770
Alright, I'm gonna use the bath...

16462
13:59:00,770 --> 13:59:01,850
Guys, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

16463
13:59:01,850 --> 13:59:04,110
It's time for a bathroom break!

16464
13:59:05,470 --> 13:59:06,110
Nevermind!

16465
13:59:08,610 --> 13:59:09,250
Nevermind.

16466
13:59:09,970 --> 13:59:11,650
Shiloh, thank you for tier one-something!

16467
13:59:11,810 --> 13:59:12,630
Thank you!

16468
13:59:15,450 --> 13:59:17,850
Look how we're just getting EU servers now.

16469
13:59:29,650 --> 13:59:30,490
It's alright.

16470
13:59:30,490 --> 13:59:31,850
I don't...

16471
13:59:31,850 --> 13:59:33,750
Can we ban Luna?

16472
13:59:33,930 --> 13:59:34,350
No.

16473
13:59:36,950 --> 13:59:37,590
Oh,

16474
13:59:41,250 --> 13:59:42,550
we have two Luna players.

16475
13:59:43,510 --> 13:59:44,250
We need to ban...

16476
13:59:44,250 --> 13:59:45,070
Oh shit, you're right.

16477
13:59:45,130 --> 13:59:46,190
We need to ban Wolverine.

16478
13:59:48,110 --> 13:59:48,490
Alright.

16479
13:59:49,550 --> 13:59:52,910
Or I won't play the game!

16480
13:59:57,700 --> 13:59:59,240
Alright, I'm banning Hawkeye.

16481
13:59:59,980 --> 14:00:00,820
Oh, fuck this.

16482
14:00:07,550 --> 14:00:08,190
Alright.

16483
14:00:08,890 --> 14:00:10,770
I guess it's Adam time.

16484
14:00:16,350 --> 14:00:16,990
We're not...

16485
14:00:16,990 --> 14:00:17,270
Oh.

16486
14:00:18,190 --> 14:00:19,010
We're banning Loki?

16487
14:00:20,010 --> 14:00:21,530
What the fuck do you mean?

16488
14:00:24,710 --> 14:00:25,350
Alright.

16489
14:00:25,930 --> 14:00:29,350
Trailblazer, you know you wanna play Mantis.

16490
14:00:30,550 --> 14:00:31,170
Alright.

16491
14:00:33,110 --> 14:00:34,610
I'm leaning back now.

16492
14:00:35,610 --> 14:00:37,930
I'm so locked in, but I'm leaning back right now.

16493
14:00:38,270 --> 14:00:39,770
I'm leaning...

16494
14:00:46,280 --> 14:00:49,220
You guys are ready to do this all over again tonight?

16495
14:00:50,580 --> 14:00:55,240
Are you guys so excited to do this all over again tonight?

16496
14:00:56,580 --> 14:00:57,640
Loki, what?

16497
14:00:58,560 --> 14:01:01,400
Oh my god, I'm at the 14 hour mark.

16498
14:01:02,120 --> 14:01:03,640
Oh my god.

16499
14:01:06,020 --> 14:01:06,860
Loki, please.

16500
14:01:07,140 --> 14:01:08,480
I'm gonna hold you off.

16501
14:01:08,940 --> 14:01:09,820
I'm joking.

16502
14:01:10,280 --> 14:01:11,820
I'm gonna take like...

16503
14:01:11,820 --> 14:01:13,000
I might play off stream.

16504
14:01:13,180 --> 14:01:13,540
I don't know.

16505
14:01:14,220 --> 14:01:14,760
But...

16506
14:01:14,760 --> 14:01:16,000
After when I wake up.

16507
14:01:16,180 --> 14:01:17,020
But like now...

16508
14:01:17,020 --> 14:01:18,200
They have a Jeff.

16509
14:01:18,200 --> 14:01:19,200
It's fucking...

16510
14:01:19,200 --> 14:01:20,040
Thank god.

16511
14:01:26,220 --> 14:01:27,460
Alright, I'm sitting up right.

16512
14:01:27,580 --> 14:01:28,680
You can Groot wall for him.

16513
14:01:31,260 --> 14:01:31,640
Ooh.

16514
14:01:32,320 --> 14:01:32,560
Damn it.

16515
14:01:37,380 --> 14:01:37,920
Wait.

16516
14:01:38,460 --> 14:01:38,960
Wait.

16517
14:01:39,740 --> 14:01:39,920
Wait.

16518
14:01:41,880 --> 14:01:42,480
That's...

16519
14:01:46,940 --> 14:01:48,580
Wait, that's a thing.

16520
14:01:48,600 --> 14:01:49,600
That ATP don't work.

16521
14:01:50,280 --> 14:01:50,980
Oh my god.

16522
14:01:51,260 --> 14:01:51,940
That's so fucking...

16523
14:01:53,020 --> 14:01:54,460
Oh my god.

16524
14:01:54,640 --> 14:01:55,300
That's great.

16525
14:01:55,620 --> 14:01:56,860
That's actually good.

16526
14:01:58,660 --> 14:01:59,940
Oh my god.

16527
14:02:00,200 --> 14:02:00,360
Oh.

16528
14:02:01,060 --> 14:02:02,740
I didn't realize that was a thing.

16529
14:02:07,420 --> 14:02:08,800
Wait, that's great.

16530
14:02:09,040 --> 14:02:10,820
That's actually so fucking funny.

16531
14:02:13,060 --> 14:02:13,980
I'm dead.

16532
14:02:14,260 --> 14:02:15,380
We're just a poke nation.

16533
14:02:18,100 --> 14:02:20,260
Oh my god.

16534
14:02:21,860 --> 14:02:22,580
Okay.

16535
14:02:23,520 --> 14:02:24,580
Is this winnable?

16536
14:02:30,160 --> 14:02:30,880
Nevermind.

16537
14:02:32,140 --> 14:02:34,100
I shouldn't have hesitated there.

16538
14:02:34,220 --> 14:02:34,880
I hesitated.

16539
14:02:38,100 --> 14:02:39,180
Jesus Christ.

16540
14:02:39,660 --> 14:02:40,560
I don't know now.

16541
14:02:40,860 --> 14:02:42,200
Feels like there's not a few.

16542
14:02:49,910 --> 14:02:51,070
Come on.

16543
14:02:51,210 --> 14:02:51,670
Please.

16544
14:02:55,430 --> 14:02:57,010
Oh my god.

16545
14:02:57,110 --> 14:02:57,530
Please.

16546
14:02:57,950 --> 14:03:00,150
Oh, they went triple support.

16547
14:03:05,290 --> 14:03:06,730
Fucking nerds.

16548
14:03:10,170 --> 14:03:11,490
I'm killing Rez.

16549
14:03:11,850 --> 14:03:12,550
Oh my god.

16550
14:03:12,630 --> 14:03:12,810
Rez.

16551
14:03:14,470 --> 14:03:15,290
Fuck off.

16552
14:03:16,330 --> 14:03:17,490
I'm on the backline.

16553
14:03:18,470 --> 14:03:19,870
Oh my god.

16554
14:03:19,890 --> 14:03:21,850
There's nothing I can do.

16555
14:03:23,610 --> 14:03:24,050
Bucky dead.

16556
14:03:26,230 --> 14:03:27,110
Rats stunned.

16557
14:03:27,610 --> 14:03:28,250
3, 2, 1.

16558
14:03:28,550 --> 14:03:29,010
Oh my god.

16559
14:03:29,010 --> 14:03:29,870
I'm coming back.

16560
14:03:30,750 --> 14:03:32,970
I'm coming back.

16561
14:03:35,210 --> 14:03:36,910
I'm coming back.

16562
14:03:42,590 --> 14:03:44,430
I'm coming back.

16563
14:03:48,170 --> 14:03:50,550
Bum bum bum.

16564
14:03:52,710 --> 14:03:55,270
I'm coming back.

16565
14:03:59,970 --> 14:04:01,630
I soulbonded just myself.

16566
14:04:02,310 --> 14:04:04,690
I just soulbonded myself.

16567
14:04:04,870 --> 14:04:05,350
That's fine.

16568
14:04:05,470 --> 14:04:06,370
I'm so important.

16569
14:04:10,950 --> 14:04:11,870
I just...

16570
14:04:11,870 --> 14:04:14,990
I accidentally just soulbonded only myself.

16571
14:04:15,570 --> 14:04:16,530
This is so bad.

16572
14:04:16,530 --> 14:04:18,290
That was such a waste.

16573
14:04:22,270 --> 14:04:23,170
I have Rez.

16574
14:04:23,290 --> 14:04:24,790
I'm gonna set up.

16575
14:04:32,340 --> 14:04:33,020
Oh my god.

16576
14:04:36,440 --> 14:04:36,820
I have...

16577
14:04:36,820 --> 14:04:38,000
I have a Sylak on me.

16578
14:04:44,950 --> 14:04:45,210
Oh.

16579
14:04:48,270 --> 14:04:48,790
Alright.

16580
14:04:49,190 --> 14:04:49,930
Born again.

16581
14:04:49,930 --> 14:04:52,450
I got a Hulk on me.

16582
14:04:53,450 --> 14:04:54,570
Alright.

16583
14:04:55,130 --> 14:04:55,730
Hulk on, Hulk on.

16584
14:04:59,630 --> 14:05:00,230
Nice.

16585
14:05:02,510 --> 14:05:04,070
No more Rez.

16586
14:05:08,040 --> 14:05:08,980
Oh my god.

16587
14:05:15,820 --> 14:05:16,940
Jesus Christ.

16588
14:05:18,060 --> 14:05:18,600
Stop.

16589
14:05:19,000 --> 14:05:19,600
Stop!

16590
14:05:26,250 --> 14:05:26,810
Nice.

16591
14:05:29,510 --> 14:05:30,150
Nice.

16592
14:05:30,370 --> 14:05:31,170
Strange, strange one.

16593
14:05:32,390 --> 14:05:33,530
I can soulbond.

16594
14:05:35,330 --> 14:05:37,450
Let me soulbond!

16595
14:05:42,620 --> 14:05:43,600
Strange half.

16596
14:05:43,720 --> 14:05:44,120
Strange one.

16597
14:05:45,160 --> 14:05:46,060
There's a Sylak though.

16598
14:05:46,400 --> 14:05:46,800
Behind.

16599
14:05:49,600 --> 14:05:56,520
Oh my god.

16600
14:05:59,360 --> 14:06:00,120
Soulbond!

16601
14:06:01,880 --> 14:06:02,640
Yeah!

16602
14:06:09,490 --> 14:06:11,590
Maybe I'll just be an Adam Warlock for me.

16603
14:06:11,710 --> 14:06:12,450
Fuck it.

16604
14:06:13,210 --> 14:06:14,890
They always bad Luna anyway.

16605
14:06:15,390 --> 14:06:18,090
Maybe I'll just be an Adam Warlock one trick.

16606
14:06:18,690 --> 14:06:20,230
Who the fuck cares?

16607
14:06:24,410 --> 14:06:26,070
I'm not an Adam player.

16608
14:06:28,630 --> 14:06:30,170
Adam is so wet.

16609
14:06:30,610 --> 14:06:32,670
I would say that I'm never gonna lose a second round.

16610
14:06:32,730 --> 14:06:33,770
I fucking can feel it.

16611
14:06:34,870 --> 14:06:36,570
I'm losing it.

16612
14:06:36,570 --> 14:06:38,830
God, I'm settling with 100 points.

16613
14:06:39,210 --> 14:06:43,270
It went from 200 to 150 to now 100.

16614
14:06:43,690 --> 14:06:44,110
I can't.

16615
14:06:46,490 --> 14:06:48,170
I can't.

16616
14:06:57,810 --> 14:07:00,830
At least at 100 it's a positive.

16617
14:07:01,270 --> 14:07:02,990
It's a positive gain.

16618
14:07:04,510 --> 14:07:07,010
I don't need soulbond yet.

16619
14:07:13,790 --> 14:07:16,090
Where are we?

16620
14:07:19,770 --> 14:07:23,770
Oh my god.

16621
14:07:32,400 --> 14:07:34,900
Oh no, I feel scared.

16622
14:07:36,000 --> 14:07:37,420
Honestly, I'm scared.

16623
14:07:39,220 --> 14:07:43,200
No, I die.

16624
14:07:44,000 --> 14:07:46,060
No, I 100% lose.

16625
14:07:49,120 --> 14:07:49,960
Nice.

16626
14:07:55,260 --> 14:07:55,680
Hit.

16627
14:07:59,460 --> 14:08:00,660
He mad.

16628
14:08:02,460 --> 14:08:04,200
Oh, that's the key base.

16629
14:08:04,340 --> 14:08:05,480
We should go for it.

16630
14:08:09,460 --> 14:08:10,440
Will you be okay?

16631
14:08:10,560 --> 14:08:10,980
Yeah, you're fine.

16632
14:08:12,260 --> 14:08:13,220
I'm healthy, I'm healthy.

16633
14:08:16,200 --> 14:08:16,840
Alright, nice.

16634
14:08:17,160 --> 14:08:17,940
Nice, nice.

16635
14:08:17,960 --> 14:08:18,600
They're TPing, they're TPing.

16636
14:08:18,660 --> 14:08:19,560
Push up, push up, push up.

16637
14:08:19,580 --> 14:08:19,960
They're TPing.

16638
14:08:20,020 --> 14:08:20,460
You can sleep them.

16639
14:08:21,740 --> 14:08:22,060
Yeah.

16640
14:08:23,180 --> 14:08:23,860
Oh, they TP.

16641
14:08:23,960 --> 14:08:24,420
They got TP.

16642
14:08:24,580 --> 14:08:25,860
I'm by myself on the TP.

16643
14:08:27,880 --> 14:08:29,340
I have the soulbond there.

16644
14:08:30,800 --> 14:08:31,600
I'm on it with you.

16645
14:08:31,720 --> 14:08:32,100
I'm with it.

16646
14:08:35,740 --> 14:08:36,060
Nice.

16647
14:08:36,180 --> 14:08:36,500
Bubbles!

16648
14:08:37,700 --> 14:08:38,480
Nah, it's fine.

16649
14:08:39,600 --> 14:08:40,000
Okay.

16650
14:08:40,760 --> 14:08:42,500
I'm cocooning, I'm cocooning, I'm cocooning.

16651
14:08:45,460 --> 14:08:46,960
I got Ryze, I got Ryze, I got Ryze.

16652
14:08:50,180 --> 14:08:50,960
Okay, I'm dead.

16653
14:08:57,070 --> 14:08:58,990
You have mantis heals, you have mantis heals.

16654
14:09:01,550 --> 14:09:02,770
It's still winnable, it's winnable.

16655
14:09:05,850 --> 14:09:06,830
Oh my god.

16656
14:09:06,830 --> 14:09:08,690
I'm an enemy!

16657
14:09:14,770 --> 14:09:15,810
Let's go!

16658
14:09:21,790 --> 14:09:22,510
Let's go!

16659
14:09:22,650 --> 14:09:24,630
I'm fucking running as fast as I can!

16660
14:09:24,750 --> 14:09:26,210
I'm the perfect specimen.

16661
14:09:26,890 --> 14:09:29,010
I'm the perfect specimen.

16662
14:09:34,270 --> 14:09:35,670
Jesus Christ.

16663
14:09:39,530 --> 14:09:39,970
Oh.

16664
14:09:40,530 --> 14:09:41,870
I'm soulbonding, I'm soulbonding this.

16665
14:09:45,070 --> 14:09:45,810
Grut's so low!

16666
14:09:47,350 --> 14:09:48,490
There's a Psylocke on point!

16667
14:09:48,630 --> 14:09:49,230
Psylocke's on point.

16668
14:09:53,730 --> 14:09:56,690
Wait, Grut's one, Grut's one!

16669
14:09:56,930 --> 14:09:57,410
I'm one shot.

16670
14:10:00,950 --> 14:10:02,270
Enemies, just stay on point.

16671
14:10:05,170 --> 14:10:06,750
No supports though, no supports.

16672
14:10:06,810 --> 14:10:07,630
We're coming over now.

16673
14:10:07,730 --> 14:10:07,890
Yeah, yeah.

16674
14:10:11,250 --> 14:10:13,570
If you need us, we're coming over.

16675
14:10:17,710 --> 14:10:19,110
I'm soulbonding, I'm soulbonding.

16676
14:10:19,110 --> 14:10:19,950
Oh, nevermind.

16677
14:10:20,190 --> 14:10:21,430
The Psylocke got me.

16678
14:10:24,830 --> 14:10:25,430
Yeah!

16679
14:10:27,990 --> 14:10:28,590
Yeah!

16680
14:10:31,130 --> 14:10:31,370
Woo!

16681
14:10:34,870 --> 14:10:37,550
Oh my god, thank you for the raid!

16682
14:10:37,870 --> 14:10:39,150
Thank you, thank you.

16683
14:10:39,450 --> 14:10:41,210
I really appreciate it.

16684
14:10:41,330 --> 14:10:42,750
Thank you so much!

16685
14:10:43,110 --> 14:10:44,370
Hello for those who are new here.

16686
14:10:44,650 --> 14:10:47,110
My name is Doki Bird.

16687
14:10:47,470 --> 14:10:48,250
Sorry, I almost forgot.

16688
14:10:48,410 --> 14:10:49,710
My name is Doki Bird.

16689
14:10:50,350 --> 14:10:55,670
And I've been playing Marvel Rivals for a while now.

16690
14:10:55,810 --> 14:10:58,990
I'm trying, I usually stream on YouTube, but I'm on Twitch right now.

16691
14:10:59,030 --> 14:11:02,510
Cause I'm trying to fucking, trying to fucking get top 500.

16692
14:11:04,190 --> 14:11:05,550
I'm so fried.

16693
14:11:06,050 --> 14:11:08,650
We were so close to 150 points.

16694
14:11:12,120 --> 14:11:15,900
I was like, Doki, and then I'm like, oh, I should say Bird.

16695
14:11:17,500 --> 14:11:19,980
Alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

16696
14:11:20,720 --> 14:11:21,840
This time for real.

16697
14:12:34,320 --> 14:12:36,120
Those people in my games.

16698
14:12:36,320 --> 14:12:38,300
I'm not used to seeing morning people.

16699
14:12:38,680 --> 14:12:43,120
I'm like, I'm not used to, I'm not used to seeing...

16700
14:12:43,120 --> 14:12:44,020
Oh my God.

16701
14:12:44,320 --> 14:12:46,120
Do we have a scrolla trick?

16702
14:12:46,340 --> 14:12:47,100
Oh my God.

16703
14:12:50,440 --> 14:12:53,800
I'm not used to seeing all these morning gamers.

16704
14:12:54,060 --> 14:12:54,880
It's so weird.

16705
14:12:55,020 --> 14:12:56,200
I'm like, who are you?

16706
14:12:57,620 --> 14:13:01,140
I can't believe out of the 14 hours of streaming.

16707
14:13:01,500 --> 14:13:06,300
I have not bumped into a single streamer that's on my team.

16708
14:13:06,980 --> 14:13:10,460
Like, how is that possible?

16709
14:13:19,620 --> 14:13:21,860
Like, on my team.

16710
14:13:22,340 --> 14:13:24,500
There were so many people.

16711
14:13:27,420 --> 14:13:30,080
I meant, like, not on my stack.

16712
14:13:30,220 --> 14:13:31,700
It's actually crazy.

16713
14:13:33,200 --> 14:13:34,700
That has never happened.

16714
14:13:38,380 --> 14:13:39,760
Oh, that's fun.

16715
14:13:39,900 --> 14:13:40,880
Do we have a hella player?

16716
14:13:42,160 --> 14:13:42,820
We don't?

16717
14:13:42,920 --> 14:13:43,660
That's alright.

16718
14:13:46,380 --> 14:13:47,140
That's alright.

16719
14:13:47,740 --> 14:13:48,920
That's alright.

16720
14:13:52,320 --> 14:13:53,100
I should.

16721
14:13:53,260 --> 14:13:55,720
I should get dark circles for the grind.

16722
14:13:56,460 --> 14:13:58,340
Let me ask my mama right now.

16723
14:14:02,840 --> 14:14:04,140
I'm messaging.

16724
14:14:04,760 --> 14:14:05,400
I'm messaging.

16725
14:14:06,000 --> 14:14:10,960
Can I get dark circles for my...

16726
14:14:14,540 --> 14:14:16,460
Heroes make them safe.

16727
14:14:19,580 --> 14:14:21,100
There we go.

16728
14:14:22,620 --> 14:14:23,420
I did it.

16729
14:14:27,940 --> 14:14:29,780
The scroll pick is about to go crazy.

16730
14:14:29,980 --> 14:14:33,600
What is the average rating of this lobby?

16731
14:14:34,720 --> 14:14:35,360
What was it?

16732
14:14:45,270 --> 14:14:47,210
Poker's in my stack!

16733
14:14:49,610 --> 14:14:51,210
It's not the same!

16734
14:14:58,290 --> 14:14:58,850
Deathcap.

16735
14:15:00,170 --> 14:15:00,730
Deathcap?

16736
14:15:00,930 --> 14:15:01,550
Fucking hell.

16737
14:15:03,890 --> 14:15:04,310
Zombie.

16738
14:15:06,790 --> 14:15:08,730
I need help, I need help, I need help.

16739
14:15:10,470 --> 14:15:11,030
Where?

16740
14:15:11,210 --> 14:15:12,290
He took the health pack too.

16741
14:15:13,370 --> 14:15:13,650
Oh.

16742
14:15:14,910 --> 14:15:17,870
He, like, ran at me.

16743
14:15:17,870 --> 14:15:19,050
Jesus Christ.

16744
14:15:21,990 --> 14:15:23,990
Why did no one help me?

16745
14:15:24,830 --> 14:15:24,890
What?

16746
14:15:26,970 --> 14:15:28,710
Nobody, what?

16747
14:15:29,230 --> 14:15:31,570
Did they all just watch me die?

16748
14:15:32,190 --> 14:15:33,610
What the fuck happened?

16749
14:15:34,750 --> 14:15:37,130
I just don't know what happened.

16750
14:15:38,650 --> 14:15:39,530
Alright.

16751
14:15:41,790 --> 14:15:43,870
Oh my god, just...

16752
14:15:45,950 --> 14:15:46,970
He's so low.

16753
14:15:47,130 --> 14:15:49,010
He's one, he's actually one.

16754
14:15:49,770 --> 14:15:50,270
Go on top.

16755
14:15:51,150 --> 14:15:52,390
Oh my god.

16756
14:15:54,590 --> 14:15:57,810
I can't believe everybody just watched that happen to me.

16757
14:15:57,990 --> 14:15:59,070
That was crazy.

16758
14:16:01,910 --> 14:16:05,510
Oh my god, the Captain America taking my health pack was so smart though.

16759
14:16:10,190 --> 14:16:10,730
Shit.

16760
14:16:17,940 --> 14:16:19,860
Okay, I'm trying to...

16761
14:16:19,860 --> 14:16:20,220
First one!

16762
14:16:22,380 --> 14:16:24,220
Oh my god, I'm coming over.

16763
14:16:24,740 --> 14:16:25,960
I'm coming back.

16764
14:16:26,040 --> 14:16:26,940
Okay, I actually gotta lock in.

16765
14:16:27,000 --> 14:16:27,580
Okay, I'm gonna lock in.

16766
14:16:27,760 --> 14:16:28,700
I'm gonna focus for real.

16767
14:16:29,500 --> 14:16:30,820
I was not focused there.

16768
14:16:31,320 --> 14:16:32,180
What's with my frame?

16769
14:16:32,280 --> 14:16:33,540
It feels so sluggish right now.

16770
14:16:34,600 --> 14:16:36,160
Alright guys, I need to focus up.

16771
14:16:37,060 --> 14:16:39,100
That was some poor gaming there.

16772
14:16:46,340 --> 14:16:47,640
I can't see you.

16773
14:16:49,320 --> 14:16:50,340
Yeah, I got pulled in.

16774
14:16:50,340 --> 14:16:55,300
Oh, door one, door one!

16775
14:17:06,220 --> 14:17:07,060
I froze.

16776
14:17:07,820 --> 14:17:08,340
I got him.

16777
14:17:09,760 --> 14:17:11,400
I have Captain America on me.

16778
14:17:11,880 --> 14:17:12,340
I had to ult.

16779
14:17:12,440 --> 14:17:12,860
I had to ult.

16780
14:17:13,240 --> 14:17:15,360
Oh, I didn't know you ulted.

16781
14:17:17,180 --> 14:17:18,200
I'll damage boost you.

16782
14:17:18,300 --> 14:17:18,760
What's on top right?

16783
14:17:22,350 --> 14:17:24,290
That was mine, but I didn't know you ulted.

16784
14:17:28,850 --> 14:17:30,430
Alright, let me Luna ult first.

16785
14:17:34,060 --> 14:17:34,900
She's half, she's half.

16786
14:17:35,040 --> 14:17:38,240
Usually Loki is second, so I never expect a Loki ult.

16787
14:17:43,020 --> 14:17:45,360
That's why I was not expecting it.

16788
14:17:45,660 --> 14:17:46,740
Loki ult is always second.

16789
14:17:47,960 --> 14:17:48,400
Definitely.

16790
14:17:48,740 --> 14:17:50,840
Because it's harder...

16791
14:17:52,060 --> 14:17:53,800
Behind us, behind me, behind me!

16792
14:17:55,920 --> 14:17:57,280
I'm on cap, I'm on cap.

16793
14:17:58,800 --> 14:17:59,840
Cap's done.

16794
14:18:03,560 --> 14:18:04,600
Jesus Christ.

16795
14:18:05,060 --> 14:18:06,880
Thor half, Thor low, Thor low, Thor low.

16796
14:18:06,880 --> 14:18:07,300
Thor, Thor, Thor.

16797
14:18:07,360 --> 14:18:08,120
Thor low, Thor, Thor, Thor.

16798
14:18:09,640 --> 14:18:10,660
Captain America half.

16799
14:18:11,000 --> 14:18:15,600
You're fucking healed!

16800
14:18:17,380 --> 14:18:20,000
Stop complaining, I'm sad.

16801
14:18:21,700 --> 14:18:23,020
I think Hela's in Arcade.

16802
14:18:28,800 --> 14:18:32,120
I'm actually so locked in now.

16803
14:18:41,400 --> 14:18:42,560
Thor behind.

16804
14:18:43,500 --> 14:18:44,340
I have one.

16805
14:18:47,320 --> 14:18:48,780
Thor's behind, I'm gonna ult this.

16806
14:18:56,480 --> 14:18:59,220
We're backing on 3, 2, 1.

16807
14:18:59,220 --> 14:18:59,980
Thor still.

16808
14:19:00,740 --> 14:19:01,720
I've frozen, I've frozen!

16809
14:19:01,960 --> 14:19:02,260
Mid ult!

16810
14:19:02,580 --> 14:19:10,900
He's still gonna have his ult.

16811
14:19:16,000 --> 14:19:18,420
Guys, where was the...

16812
14:19:18,420 --> 14:19:20,060
I have a Captain America on me.

16813
14:19:23,620 --> 14:19:25,380
I'm stunned, I'm stunned, I'm hooked.

16814
14:19:25,940 --> 14:19:26,880
I got you, I got you, I got you.

16815
14:19:28,360 --> 14:19:29,280
Hela's one, Hela's one.

16816
14:19:29,300 --> 14:19:31,140
Thor and Thor's behind us.

16817
14:19:46,290 --> 14:19:47,910
Captain America low, low, low.

16818
14:19:47,930 --> 14:19:48,570
Captain America one.

16819
14:19:48,730 --> 14:19:49,030
Kepler, Kepler.

16820
14:19:50,410 --> 14:19:51,330
He's healed, he's healed.

16821
14:19:51,410 --> 14:19:51,930
Kepler, Kepler.

16822
14:19:52,850 --> 14:19:53,790
Oh my god.

16823
14:19:54,630 --> 14:19:57,370
Thank you for saying nice freeze, it means a lot guys.

16824
14:19:58,050 --> 14:20:00,770
After everything I went through, thank you so much.

16825
14:20:01,470 --> 14:20:02,110
Oh my god.

16826
14:20:09,290 --> 14:20:09,930
Thor has ult.

16827
14:20:17,570 --> 14:20:18,610
It's fine.

16828
14:20:19,250 --> 14:20:19,790
Hela's one HP.

16829
14:20:20,150 --> 14:20:22,850
I feel so locked in.

16830
14:20:24,210 --> 14:20:25,770
Thank you for ego boosting me.

16831
14:20:26,170 --> 14:20:26,710
I need it.

16832
14:20:28,210 --> 14:20:29,830
I told you I could lock in.

16833
14:20:30,470 --> 14:20:31,970
Guys, I told you.

16834
14:20:32,470 --> 14:20:33,370
I told you I could...

16835
14:20:34,690 --> 14:20:35,670
Oh no!

16836
14:20:36,110 --> 14:20:38,390
I'm still locked in, but I can't save him.

16837
14:20:41,430 --> 14:20:45,090
I was locked in, but what can I do about that?

16838
14:20:45,390 --> 14:20:46,410
Thor is behind, Thor is behind.

16839
14:20:46,570 --> 14:20:47,290
I froze him again.

16840
14:20:52,980 --> 14:20:54,400
I had to...

16841
14:20:56,000 --> 14:20:57,600
I got you, I got you, I got you.

16842
14:20:58,540 --> 14:20:59,280
They're almost dead.

16843
14:21:04,960 --> 14:21:06,220
I'm hoping after.

16844
14:21:06,220 --> 14:21:06,280
I'm hoping after.

16845
14:21:11,500 --> 14:21:13,200
Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor.

16846
14:21:15,780 --> 14:21:17,900
I hate looking up.

16847
14:21:19,780 --> 14:21:21,000
No more supports.

16848
14:21:22,820 --> 14:21:23,800
I have to reload.

16849
14:21:31,300 --> 14:21:32,060
Lunar top right.

16850
14:21:36,280 --> 14:21:37,760
We have a pick, we have a pick.

16851
14:21:39,480 --> 14:21:40,620
Thor on the bridge.

16852
14:21:44,620 --> 14:21:46,300
I froze somebody, I don't know who.

16853
14:21:54,200 --> 14:21:56,500
I have Captain America on me.

16854
14:22:01,130 --> 14:22:02,090
I'm dead.

16855
14:22:02,210 --> 14:22:03,830
Oh my god.

16856
14:22:09,780 --> 14:22:11,460
I don't think we get that.

16857
14:22:11,580 --> 14:22:13,520
No, we have to fight second point.

16858
14:22:13,660 --> 14:22:14,680
Oh, that was so close.

16859
14:22:15,160 --> 14:22:16,260
I don't think we can touch that.

16860
14:22:21,480 --> 14:22:22,280
I'm regrouping.

16861
14:22:29,470 --> 14:22:30,210
Help, help, help.

16862
14:22:31,230 --> 14:22:32,310
There's two tanks in there.

16863
14:22:32,770 --> 14:22:33,330
I froze him.

16864
14:22:38,830 --> 14:22:39,810
He wasted ult.

16865
14:22:48,080 --> 14:22:48,940
They have night ult.

16866
14:22:50,880 --> 14:22:51,560
Nice, nice.

16867
14:22:51,780 --> 14:22:52,760
We got two, we got two.

16868
14:22:52,800 --> 14:22:53,300
We should push up.

16869
14:22:57,840 --> 14:22:59,380
Hold on, hold on.

16870
14:23:00,280 --> 14:23:02,080
I'm trying to keep you up.

16871
14:23:10,830 --> 14:23:12,330
I hear people behind us.

16872
14:23:12,370 --> 14:23:13,050
Yeah, Thor's behind us.

16873
14:23:13,050 --> 14:23:14,170
Thor's behind our Loki.

16874
14:23:15,630 --> 14:23:16,430
Get him, get him, get him.

16875
14:23:16,450 --> 14:23:16,670
He's stunned.

16876
14:23:17,090 --> 14:23:17,630
He's stunned again.

16877
14:23:18,650 --> 14:23:19,510
Nice, Captain America.

16878
14:23:21,510 --> 14:23:22,950
We have Vlad's last fight.

16879
14:23:26,780 --> 14:23:28,080
Someone might have ult.

16880
14:23:29,080 --> 14:23:30,700
I am ready to put on a show.

16881
14:23:31,380 --> 14:23:32,000
I'm on my health.

16882
14:23:32,440 --> 14:23:37,020
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting.

16883
14:23:47,030 --> 14:23:49,710
Both tanks are on us.

16884
14:23:51,470 --> 14:23:52,830
Oh, nice, DC9.

16885
14:23:54,490 --> 14:23:55,990
Oh, my god.

16886
14:23:58,610 --> 14:24:01,670
I played out of my mind there, guys.

16887
14:24:02,790 --> 14:24:08,890
I might have fucked up in the beginning, but I played out of my mind later on.

16888
14:24:12,810 --> 14:24:16,870
I fucking shut down their Thor so many times.

16889
14:24:18,050 --> 14:24:20,570
I locked the fucking...

16890
14:24:20,570 --> 14:24:21,830
Thank you for the tier one sub.

16891
14:24:21,890 --> 14:24:22,550
Thank you, thank you.

16892
14:24:25,090 --> 14:24:26,150
I did it.

16893
14:24:26,730 --> 14:24:28,370
Girl, thank you for the tier one sub.

16894
14:24:28,470 --> 14:24:29,130
Thank you, thank you.

16895
14:24:29,130 --> 14:24:30,470
Thank you for the Twitch prize.

16896
14:24:30,550 --> 14:24:31,570
Thank you, thank you.

16897
14:24:32,010 --> 14:24:33,070
It's 14 hours.

16898
14:24:33,190 --> 14:24:34,330
I told you, Luna's like...

16899
14:24:34,330 --> 14:24:37,810
I can fucking play Luna, like, on autopilot.

16900
14:24:37,990 --> 14:24:40,130
Like, when you play...

16901
14:24:40,130 --> 14:24:42,810
It's not like, you know, like in Apex, I just talk while I play.

16902
14:24:42,910 --> 14:24:44,690
Because I just go autopilot at that point.

16903
14:24:45,310 --> 14:24:46,130
I just, like...

16904
14:24:46,130 --> 14:24:50,090
I play so much that, like, I can play them, like...

16905
14:24:50,090 --> 14:24:52,430
I don't have to, like...

16906
14:24:52,430 --> 14:24:54,290
I'm locked in, but I don't have to, like...

16907
14:24:55,190 --> 14:24:56,230
Think too much.

16908
14:24:58,690 --> 14:25:00,550
Because she's so, like...

16909
14:25:00,550 --> 14:25:01,850
She's so easy.

16910
14:25:06,570 --> 14:25:09,170
She's such an easy character to master.

16911
14:25:13,760 --> 14:25:15,020
What's my healing at?

16912
14:25:15,120 --> 14:25:15,720
28k.

16913
14:25:17,480 --> 14:25:18,940
It's only been on Bogr.

16914
14:25:18,940 --> 14:25:22,120
I usually put the snowflake on whoever I'm playing with.

16915
14:25:25,540 --> 14:25:27,060
No thoughts, just heals.

16916
14:25:29,800 --> 14:25:32,480
Guys, it's gonna be over in four more days, guys.

16917
14:25:32,560 --> 14:25:33,520
I swear to God.

16918
14:25:37,960 --> 14:25:40,200
It's gonna be over in four more days, guys.

16919
14:25:40,840 --> 14:25:43,000
It's gonna be over soon.

16920
14:25:46,100 --> 14:25:47,520
I froze Captain America.

16921
14:25:47,640 --> 14:25:48,240
Captain America low.

16922
14:25:50,680 --> 14:25:52,000
Torb, Torb, Torb.

16923
14:25:52,520 --> 14:25:53,340
We should push up.

16924
14:25:53,580 --> 14:25:54,700
I'm looking at Luna on point.

16925
14:25:55,400 --> 14:25:56,020
Luna, half.

16926
14:25:57,000 --> 14:25:57,720
Go point, go point.

16927
14:25:57,740 --> 14:25:58,780
We should go point, we should go point.

16928
14:25:59,540 --> 14:26:00,580
We have two picks.

16929
14:26:01,880 --> 14:26:02,520
Kept out, kept out.

16930
14:26:03,040 --> 14:26:03,900
I froze Strange.

16931
14:26:04,060 --> 14:26:05,340
Strange is low, Strange is low.

16932
14:26:05,500 --> 14:26:06,060
Strange is one.

16933
14:26:06,820 --> 14:26:07,920
Actually one, actually one.

16934
14:26:08,780 --> 14:26:09,940
RK two, RK two.

16935
14:26:10,220 --> 14:26:10,500
Low, low.

16936
14:26:11,220 --> 14:26:11,680
They got out.

16937
14:26:15,900 --> 14:26:16,300
Yippee.

16938
14:26:19,620 --> 14:26:20,900
Oh, we should go to Bastion.

16939
14:26:22,520 --> 14:26:25,280
That's fucking right, go to freezes.

16940
14:26:25,680 --> 14:26:27,020
That's right!

16941
14:26:27,900 --> 14:26:29,220
Enable me!

16942
14:26:30,160 --> 14:26:32,420
I'm fucking gaming!

16943
14:26:37,600 --> 14:26:39,060
They can't stop me.

16944
14:26:41,760 --> 14:26:42,580
Wait, they are.

16945
14:26:42,820 --> 14:26:43,080
What?

16946
14:26:43,280 --> 14:26:44,240
They are going three things.

16947
14:26:44,640 --> 14:26:45,940
Oh my God!

16948
14:26:45,940 --> 14:26:45,940
Wait,

16949
14:26:50,260 --> 14:26:50,780
he's low.

16950
14:26:59,450 --> 14:27:00,450
I can't.

16951
14:27:00,650 --> 14:27:01,610
Oh, I stunned him.

16952
14:27:02,070 --> 14:27:02,830
Nice, nice.

16953
14:27:07,230 --> 14:27:09,790
Oh, you're so, you're so healthy.

16954
14:27:10,110 --> 14:27:11,310
They're so low, they're so low.

16955
14:27:13,530 --> 14:27:14,370
They're really low.

16956
14:27:15,110 --> 14:27:15,910
Kept out, kept out.

16957
14:27:16,570 --> 14:27:17,870
Torb one, Torb one, Torb one.

16958
14:27:18,650 --> 14:27:18,930
Oh.

16959
14:27:20,430 --> 14:27:23,910
Nice, nice, nice.

16960
14:27:23,910 --> 14:27:25,330
Keep three or two on points.

16961
14:27:27,510 --> 14:27:28,530
Oh my God.

16962
14:27:28,890 --> 14:27:30,450
This is so easy.

16963
14:27:30,610 --> 14:27:32,350
Best Storm NA?

16964
14:27:32,990 --> 14:27:33,250
Ooh.

16965
14:27:37,010 --> 14:27:39,410
That would've been so cool if it hit, you know?

16966
14:27:39,630 --> 14:27:42,610
I don't think they're gonna, yeah, they're not gonna contest.

16967
14:27:42,690 --> 14:27:43,450
Yeah, I'm pushed.

16968
14:27:45,930 --> 14:27:46,450
Unless...

16969
14:27:46,450 --> 14:27:47,390
I'll go.

16970
14:27:49,690 --> 14:27:51,030
I'm damage boosting.

16971
14:27:52,750 --> 14:27:54,190
I'm damage boosting.

16972
14:27:56,490 --> 14:27:57,030
I'm damage boosting.

16973
14:27:57,030 --> 14:27:57,770
Torb, Torb, Torb.

16974
14:28:01,410 --> 14:28:01,870
Torb?

16975
14:28:02,050 --> 14:28:03,270
He's half, he's one.

16976
14:28:05,510 --> 14:28:05,950
Oh!

16977
14:28:06,350 --> 14:28:07,330
Nice, nice, left, nice, left.

16978
14:28:11,170 --> 14:28:12,190
Strange is low, Strange.

16979
14:28:13,430 --> 14:28:14,930
Oh my God.

16980
14:28:15,150 --> 14:28:15,570
Nice, nice, nice.

16981
14:28:15,750 --> 14:28:16,110
What?

16982
14:28:18,770 --> 14:28:19,350
Kill her.

16983
14:28:20,330 --> 14:28:20,790
Okay.

16984
14:28:24,910 --> 14:28:26,310
Okay.

16985
14:28:33,610 --> 14:28:35,010
Okay?

16986
14:28:37,350 --> 14:28:39,050
Same, buddy.

16987
14:28:39,390 --> 14:28:39,990
Same.

16988
14:28:44,130 --> 14:28:45,530
Yay!

16989
14:28:52,590 --> 14:28:54,010
I'm here too.

16990
14:28:58,510 --> 14:28:59,870
I take those.

16991
14:29:00,590 --> 14:29:02,130
I fucking take those.

16992
14:29:06,890 --> 14:29:11,210
You're against bots to make streamers feel better?

16993
14:29:11,850 --> 14:29:14,810
What a sad game!

16994
14:29:14,810 --> 14:29:15,550
Oh!

16995
14:29:19,930 --> 14:29:24,650
I wish that were true because this guy's a real person.

16996
14:29:24,850 --> 14:29:26,150
This guy's a real person.

16997
14:29:26,290 --> 14:29:28,030
These guys are real people.

16998
14:29:31,010 --> 14:29:32,870
Oh my God, okay, but we'll do what, guys?

16999
14:29:33,070 --> 14:29:36,090
Okay, but what if we win another one and then we're 130, guys?

17000
14:29:37,050 --> 14:29:38,910
Actual paid actors.

17001
14:29:40,170 --> 14:29:43,750
I'm sorry to say, but I know this guy's real.

17002
14:29:43,750 --> 14:29:46,370
If anything, I know this guy.

17003
14:29:46,790 --> 14:29:50,750
Guys, okay, but what if we win the next game, though, guys?

17004
14:29:51,010 --> 14:29:55,390
Guys, okay, but if we win the next game, we'll be 130.

17005
14:29:55,610 --> 14:29:59,290
And that's almost like 150, though.

17006
14:29:59,810 --> 14:30:02,130
Guys, I'm all in.

17007
14:30:02,810 --> 14:30:03,610
All in.

17008
14:30:03,710 --> 14:30:04,590
Let's go gambling.

17009
14:30:07,590 --> 14:30:08,770
Let's go gambling.

17010
14:30:10,510 --> 14:30:13,210
Guys, this is where the win streak is.

17011
14:30:13,210 --> 14:30:14,510
I believe.

17012
14:30:18,770 --> 14:30:19,630
It's true.

17013
14:30:19,970 --> 14:30:20,950
150 is 50.

17014
14:30:21,070 --> 14:30:21,490
Oh my.

17015
14:30:21,790 --> 14:30:23,330
150 is 50 off.

17016
14:30:24,470 --> 14:30:25,550
Oh shit, okay.

17017
14:30:26,290 --> 14:30:28,950
Okay, maybe it was a little bit of a mistake.

17018
14:30:30,790 --> 14:30:31,830
Okay, wait.

17019
14:30:36,480 --> 14:30:37,080
Wait.

17020
14:30:37,800 --> 14:30:38,840
Oh no, wait.

17021
14:30:39,420 --> 14:30:43,080
We have a magic one trick and a Captain America one trick.

17022
14:30:43,240 --> 14:30:44,440
I think we need Captain America.

17023
14:30:45,780 --> 14:30:47,200
Yeah, I'm down to New Cap.

17024
14:30:47,280 --> 14:30:47,860
You want me on Cap?

17025
14:30:49,100 --> 14:30:50,760
I mean, you can ban something else if you want.

17026
14:30:51,700 --> 14:30:54,440
I mean, guys, you have your choices right now.

17027
14:30:54,720 --> 14:30:55,260
You can choose.

17028
14:30:55,740 --> 14:30:56,360
Oh no.

17029
14:30:56,580 --> 14:30:58,020
You're the EU prodigy, buddy.

17030
14:30:58,540 --> 14:30:59,680
What's your call on it, man?

17031
14:31:00,500 --> 14:31:00,940
Oh man.

17032
14:31:03,280 --> 14:31:05,260
What's the EU Aura Maxers saying?

17033
14:31:05,340 --> 14:31:06,200
Oh man.

17034
14:31:06,940 --> 14:31:11,440
Part of me says that we should ban Hawkeye, but a second part of me says...

17035
14:31:14,020 --> 14:31:15,100
I can't lie to you.

17036
14:31:15,200 --> 14:31:17,080
I know that guy that wants magic.

17037
14:31:17,260 --> 14:31:19,200
He low-key might be the best magic in the game.

17038
14:31:19,700 --> 14:31:20,380
Wait, what?

17039
14:31:22,900 --> 14:31:23,700
This might...

17040
14:31:23,700 --> 14:31:24,840
It's gonna flip.

17041
14:31:25,060 --> 14:31:25,800
Fucking weebo.

17042
14:31:27,000 --> 14:31:27,960
I told you, I told you.

17043
14:31:28,220 --> 14:31:29,000
No, you fuck you.

17044
14:31:29,120 --> 14:31:30,540
You fucking piece of...

17045
14:31:30,540 --> 14:31:32,580
Who did that?

17046
14:31:33,620 --> 14:31:34,380
Who did that?

17047
14:31:34,380 --> 14:31:34,580
Who did that?

17048
14:31:36,480 --> 14:31:37,440
I didn't vote, buddy.

17049
14:31:43,680 --> 14:31:44,600
Who did it?

17050
14:31:47,780 --> 14:31:49,080
Who could have...

17051
14:31:49,080 --> 14:31:51,800
Who could have done something like that?

17052
14:31:52,380 --> 14:31:55,820
Oh man, I think we're gonna lose because of me.

17053
14:32:00,480 --> 14:32:01,940
The demons, Doki.

17054
14:32:02,060 --> 14:32:03,080
They're taking over.

17055
14:32:04,020 --> 14:32:06,720
If we die to magic, even one fight, Doki.

17056
14:32:07,240 --> 14:32:08,500
It's on you.

17057
14:32:11,440 --> 14:32:13,510
Wait, I didn't do it.

17058
14:32:14,340 --> 14:32:19,020
I cannot believe that Nightmare lost to me, Tei.

17059
14:32:19,580 --> 14:32:20,780
That's diabolical.

17060
14:32:24,720 --> 14:32:27,320
The guy that we accused of cheating, Tei.

17061
14:32:27,400 --> 14:32:29,780
He's from the team that won the NA tournament, Doki.

17062
14:32:30,440 --> 14:32:30,980
Yeah.

17063
14:32:31,140 --> 14:32:33,000
Wait, I didn't accuse him.

17064
14:32:33,120 --> 14:32:34,720
I didn't accuse him.

17065
14:32:36,100 --> 14:32:37,760
You particularly accused him.

17066
14:32:38,020 --> 14:32:40,540
No, no, I was like, let's invite him.

17067
14:32:41,920 --> 14:32:44,400
I said, let's invite him.

17068
14:32:47,980 --> 14:32:50,460
This could have been over, we got Rosa.

17069
14:32:53,180 --> 14:32:58,000
But if we had the easy way, then we would not have learned the hard way.

17070
14:33:03,820 --> 14:33:05,180
I froze somebody.

17071
14:33:07,520 --> 14:33:09,100
Can you top me off, real quick?

17072
14:33:12,020 --> 14:33:13,380
My new one!

17073
14:33:18,130 --> 14:33:20,530
He's focusing the E-spark on him.

17074
14:33:31,530 --> 14:33:33,810
Just have magic there.

17075
14:33:35,230 --> 14:33:35,970
There he is.

17076
14:33:52,070 --> 14:33:53,390
Oh my god.

17077
14:33:54,930 --> 14:33:56,930
What the fuck?

17078
14:34:01,750 --> 14:34:02,530
Guys.

17079
14:34:02,930 --> 14:34:04,550
Guys, I think I fucked up.

17080
14:34:08,650 --> 14:34:09,430
Guys,

17081
14:34:16,310 --> 14:34:18,150
I might have fucked up, guys.

17082
14:34:21,350 --> 14:34:22,130
Guys.

17083
14:34:22,770 --> 14:34:25,510
I might have fucked up.

17084
14:34:27,950 --> 14:34:31,150
I think we just gotta win another one after this, guys.

17085
14:34:32,350 --> 14:34:33,310
We mantis ult first.

17086
14:34:40,180 --> 14:34:41,100
Save our Magnia.

17087
14:34:51,220 --> 14:34:51,740
Okay.

17088
14:34:56,340 --> 14:34:56,860
Okay.

17089
14:35:00,020 --> 14:35:00,540
That's...

17090
14:35:01,220 --> 14:35:04,360
Guys, I might have fucked up.

17091
14:35:05,640 --> 14:35:06,840
My mantis was low.

17092
14:35:11,600 --> 14:35:15,520
Guys, I might have fucked up, guys.

17093
14:35:16,100 --> 14:35:19,340
Guys, I might have fucked up.

17094
14:35:21,640 --> 14:35:24,860
I might have fucked up.

17095
14:35:28,140 --> 14:35:30,140
I didn't know!

17096
14:35:30,540 --> 14:35:31,340
I just...

17097
14:35:31,340 --> 14:35:34,060
I always ban Hawkeye!

17098
14:35:36,940 --> 14:35:39,360
I always ban Hawkeye!

17099
14:35:39,880 --> 14:35:41,600
How is this my fault?

17100
14:35:46,010 --> 14:35:49,090
I ban Hawkeye before they said anything.

17101
14:35:49,210 --> 14:35:50,230
That's not me.

17102
14:35:54,570 --> 14:35:57,390
Bob, thank you for the 2,500 bitties.

17103
14:35:59,790 --> 14:36:00,310
Okay.

17104
14:36:00,830 --> 14:36:03,170
All they said was they had a magic one trick.

17105
14:36:03,330 --> 14:36:05,370
And I was like, who the fuck cares about magic?

17106
14:36:05,490 --> 14:36:06,590
I'm getting Hawkeye.

17107
14:36:06,590 --> 14:36:12,210
And then after I banned Hawkeye, he was like, might be the best magic player I've ever seen.

17108
14:36:12,370 --> 14:36:13,510
And I was like, oh.

17109
14:36:17,570 --> 14:36:18,750
Oh, okay.

17110
14:36:24,170 --> 14:36:26,350
We're just keeping the game interesting, guys.

17111
14:36:28,430 --> 14:36:30,230
Honestly, who would have thought?

17112
14:36:32,470 --> 14:36:33,530
Alright, wait, there we go.

17113
14:36:34,890 --> 14:36:36,930
I'm never banning again, guys.

17114
14:36:36,990 --> 14:36:37,490
I've learned.

17115
14:36:40,350 --> 14:36:42,890
Please, somebody else shoot the thing!

17116
14:36:44,690 --> 14:36:45,070
What?

17117
14:36:46,090 --> 14:36:47,570
How did I get down here?

17118
14:36:48,790 --> 14:36:50,890
Oh, we win this, we win this, we win this.

17119
14:36:51,190 --> 14:36:51,990
Oh, look who won, look who won.

17120
14:36:52,170 --> 14:36:55,490
I'm on head to point.

17121
14:36:56,910 --> 14:36:57,530
I'm on point.

17122
14:37:01,680 --> 14:37:02,540
I can't see you.

17123
14:37:07,000 --> 14:37:07,880
Yeah, sorry about that.

17124
14:37:11,500 --> 14:37:12,220
Oh, man.

17125
14:37:22,140 --> 14:37:26,920
Okay, that's... yeah, that's a little overconfident.

17126
14:37:27,160 --> 14:37:27,980
Nice kill, nice kill.

17127
14:37:28,140 --> 14:37:28,560
Play with our Hela.

17128
14:37:28,780 --> 14:37:29,260
Fuck with our Hela.

17129
14:37:29,340 --> 14:37:29,980
Damage boost our Hela.

17130
14:37:30,080 --> 14:37:30,680
Give her everything.

17131
14:37:32,280 --> 14:37:33,520
She will carry this game.

17132
14:37:40,940 --> 14:37:41,540
You don't need me.

17133
14:37:44,560 --> 14:37:45,600
Fuck with our Hela, bro.

17134
14:37:45,740 --> 14:37:46,960
She's everything, she's God.

17135
14:37:47,900 --> 14:37:48,900
Oh my God.

17136
14:37:50,440 --> 14:37:52,540
Just damage boost only Hela.

17137
14:37:53,520 --> 14:37:54,900
Damage boost only Hela, I don't care.

17138
14:37:56,300 --> 14:37:58,600
Kill her, damage boost her, pocket her, shield her.

17139
14:37:59,960 --> 14:38:01,140
Fucking mantis ult her.

17140
14:38:01,880 --> 14:38:04,280
Okay, okay, I'll make sure she won't die.

17141
14:38:05,180 --> 14:38:06,260
Mantis ult first, though.

17142
14:38:06,380 --> 14:38:07,060
Oh, they're gonna...

17143
14:38:07,060 --> 14:38:08,900
They're going point, they're going point.

17144
14:38:12,300 --> 14:38:14,540
Yo, I'm gonna whale your Shango, okay?

17145
14:38:16,320 --> 14:38:17,900
I'm dropping a whale on your Shango.

17146
14:38:19,180 --> 14:38:20,980
Oh, they fucking broke my platform.

17147
14:38:22,180 --> 14:38:22,560
But I won.

17148
14:38:23,220 --> 14:38:24,220
He's low, he's low, he's so low.

17149
14:38:24,240 --> 14:38:24,720
I won, I won.

17150
14:38:26,840 --> 14:38:28,060
He's still really low, he's still low.

17151
14:38:31,000 --> 14:38:32,200
I will be safe.

17152
14:38:33,420 --> 14:38:34,020
Got him, got him, got him.

17153
14:38:41,890 --> 14:38:42,530
I can't.

17154
14:38:44,610 --> 14:38:45,610
I'm trying to get the Hela.

17155
14:38:47,070 --> 14:38:48,030
Okay, okay.

17156
14:38:48,230 --> 14:38:49,510
Okay, that was really funny.

17157
14:38:49,970 --> 14:38:50,890
I can't, I'm not even...

17158
14:38:50,890 --> 14:38:52,870
It's not, like, sleep deprived funny.

17159
14:38:53,330 --> 14:38:54,690
It's like, okay, I...

17160
14:38:55,890 --> 14:38:56,850
Okay, okay.

17161
14:39:03,450 --> 14:39:04,410
It's actually...

17162
14:39:06,190 --> 14:39:07,250
I'm gonna ult this.

17163
14:39:08,670 --> 14:39:12,010
If you wanna be safe, please stay on the point.

17164
14:39:15,650 --> 14:39:16,370
Okay.

17165
14:39:16,750 --> 14:39:21,010
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

17166
14:39:23,890 --> 14:39:24,690
Oh, man.

17167
14:39:25,650 --> 14:39:26,910
Oh, they got it halfway.

17168
14:39:27,130 --> 14:39:27,710
That's funny.

17169
14:39:30,590 --> 14:39:32,930
I thought it would do...

17170
14:39:32,930 --> 14:39:33,050
I

17171
14:39:37,110 --> 14:39:41,870
legitimately thought it would block the meteorite.

17172
14:39:43,690 --> 14:39:46,410
I thought it would block it.

17173
14:39:52,430 --> 14:39:54,740
I don't know.

17174
14:39:55,310 --> 14:39:56,880
I don't know.

17175
14:39:57,060 --> 14:39:57,850
I just thought...

17176
14:40:02,780 --> 14:40:05,680
I didn't get a chance.

17177
14:40:08,800 --> 14:40:12,240
Oh, my God.

17178
14:40:21,440 --> 14:40:23,860
3, 2, 1.

17179
14:40:26,500 --> 14:40:30,080
Was it a pillar or a giant metal ball?

17180
14:40:30,440 --> 14:40:32,120
I didn't know.

17181
14:40:32,700 --> 14:40:35,120
I legitimately thought I'd be safe.

17182
14:40:35,840 --> 14:40:37,960
I thought it would block it.

17183
14:40:39,580 --> 14:40:43,020
Magic, magic, magic.

17184
14:40:45,600 --> 14:40:48,020
I think it's under stat...

17185
14:40:48,020 --> 14:40:48,940
Oh, it's fine, we're even.

17186
14:40:49,160 --> 14:40:50,040
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

17187
14:40:51,300 --> 14:40:52,800
I'm dropping point, I'm dropping point.

17188
14:40:53,500 --> 14:40:54,320
Behind us, Magic.

17189
14:40:55,380 --> 14:40:56,860
Magic is on me.

17190
14:40:57,900 --> 14:40:59,000
Pocket our healer, pocket our healer.

17191
14:40:59,060 --> 14:40:59,640
I don't care what's happening.

17192
14:40:59,860 --> 14:41:00,300
Give her everything.

17193
14:41:00,880 --> 14:41:01,680
I'm pocketing.

17194
14:41:02,000 --> 14:41:02,560
Give her everything.

17195
14:41:03,220 --> 14:41:04,940
She is so pocketed!

17196
14:41:05,060 --> 14:41:07,140
If you have to die, if you have to die, you have to die.

17197
14:41:07,380 --> 14:41:07,960
Just pocket it.

17198
14:41:08,780 --> 14:41:09,560
She's alive!

17199
14:41:10,320 --> 14:41:10,720
Sacrifice.

17200
14:41:11,640 --> 14:41:12,320
Sacrifice yourself.

17201
14:41:16,140 --> 14:41:17,240
Wait, there's a...

17202
14:41:17,240 --> 14:41:18,660
There's a healer back there.

17203
14:41:20,040 --> 14:41:21,720
Don't worry, I got you.

17204
14:41:22,800 --> 14:41:23,200
Thank you.

17205
14:41:23,200 --> 14:41:23,460
Thank you.

17206
14:41:29,240 --> 14:41:31,100
I'm with you, bro.

17207
14:41:31,260 --> 14:41:32,620
Hey, Mantis, can you look at me real quick?

17208
14:41:33,040 --> 14:41:34,620
I need heals, thank you.

17209
14:41:39,100 --> 14:41:40,260
Oh my god.

17210
14:41:40,540 --> 14:41:41,240
I'm gonna get them.

17211
14:41:41,380 --> 14:41:42,220
They have a name warner now.

17212
14:41:42,860 --> 14:41:43,380
It's fine, it's fine.

17213
14:41:43,460 --> 14:41:44,560
I'm gonna go behind them, I'm gonna go behind them.

17214
14:41:44,720 --> 14:41:45,220
They won't expect it.

17215
14:41:45,960 --> 14:41:47,300
They won't expect it.

17216
14:41:51,540 --> 14:41:52,220
They're one, they're one.

17217
14:41:52,320 --> 14:41:53,180
They're all one, they're all one.

17218
14:41:53,340 --> 14:41:53,600
All one.

17219
14:41:55,740 --> 14:41:57,060
I can't fight this.

17220
14:41:57,140 --> 14:41:57,800
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.

17221
14:41:59,680 --> 14:42:00,800
Don't worry, you'll live!

17222
14:42:07,200 --> 14:42:08,400
You're so alive.

17223
14:42:08,500 --> 14:42:09,660
Hella, hella, hella, hella, hella, hella.

17224
14:42:09,680 --> 14:42:10,540
Let's kill this Hella.

17225
14:42:12,420 --> 14:42:13,880
Hold the choke, hold the choke, hold the choke.

17226
14:42:22,860 --> 14:42:24,040
Death Strangler, nice.

17227
14:42:24,500 --> 14:42:24,900
Protect.

17228
14:42:31,040 --> 14:42:32,420
No, don't let our Hella die!

17229
14:42:34,820 --> 14:42:35,800
He was one.

17230
14:42:39,980 --> 14:42:40,600
I'm asleep.

17231
14:42:41,140 --> 14:42:42,040
I woke you up.

17232
14:42:44,280 --> 14:42:45,040
I didn't see Strange.

17233
14:42:45,920 --> 14:42:46,780
I hear someone behind me.

17234
14:42:48,040 --> 14:42:49,180
I hear someone behind me.

17235
14:42:49,620 --> 14:42:50,660
I think they're walking downstairs.

17236
14:42:50,940 --> 14:42:51,400
I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

17237
14:42:54,180 --> 14:42:55,140
Yep, there he is!

17238
14:42:55,140 --> 14:42:57,140
I mean, I killed you guys.

17239
14:42:58,360 --> 14:42:59,860
It's all good, it's all good.

17240
14:43:04,680 --> 14:43:05,400
It's fine.

17241
14:43:08,440 --> 14:43:10,480
Also, yes, if you ever see me, please ban Hella.

17242
14:43:10,620 --> 14:43:11,620
I don't like playing this character.

17243
14:43:12,560 --> 14:43:14,860
Listen, you, Starlord, need to go flank.

17244
14:43:15,440 --> 14:43:15,960
With your ult.

17245
14:43:16,300 --> 14:43:16,780
And not die.

17246
14:43:17,300 --> 14:43:18,180
And press the button.

17247
14:43:18,560 --> 14:43:19,500
Or ult and sub tank.

17248
14:43:21,620 --> 14:43:22,200
No, we don't need a tank.

17249
14:43:22,540 --> 14:43:23,720
We don't need a tank.

17250
14:43:23,960 --> 14:43:24,960
We can just win with this.

17251
14:43:26,240 --> 14:43:26,740
I'm asleep.

17252
14:43:29,720 --> 14:43:30,540
My shield is down.

17253
14:43:32,320 --> 14:43:33,120
Left side, left side.

17254
14:43:35,420 --> 14:43:36,020
There's one.

17255
14:43:36,300 --> 14:43:37,000
I have to reload.

17256
14:43:38,100 --> 14:43:38,740
I have ult here.

17257
14:43:40,160 --> 14:43:41,060
I'm going, I'm going.

17258
14:43:47,630 --> 14:43:48,650
That's fine, we're even.

17259
14:43:49,650 --> 14:43:50,630
Dropping point, dropping point.

17260
14:43:54,990 --> 14:43:55,830
I got him, I got him.

17261
14:43:57,270 --> 14:43:58,110
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

17262
14:43:58,650 --> 14:43:59,730
Change, change, change.

17263
14:44:00,050 --> 14:44:01,170
Nice, good job.

17264
14:44:02,250 --> 14:44:03,670
Oh my god.

17265
14:44:04,890 --> 14:44:07,630
Oh my god, we did it.

17266
14:44:08,450 --> 14:44:10,250
I get near site and explode.

17267
14:44:10,430 --> 14:44:10,950
It's terrible.

17268
14:44:11,410 --> 14:44:12,730
Oh my god.

17269
14:44:18,610 --> 14:44:20,490
I'm settling with this.

17270
14:44:24,090 --> 14:44:29,270
I don't think we can get better games.

17271
14:44:29,990 --> 14:44:33,330
I'm settling, I'm settling.

17272
14:44:35,170 --> 14:44:37,150
I'm settling.

17273
14:44:41,370 --> 14:44:42,030
Really?

17274
14:44:43,850 --> 14:44:45,170
Wow.

17275
14:44:52,440 --> 14:44:53,580
Oh my god, he sees.

17276
14:44:55,000 --> 14:44:55,700
Wow.

17277
14:44:56,640 --> 14:44:58,800
He's fucking pushing my buttons.

17278
14:44:59,120 --> 14:45:00,760
He knows what to say.

17279
14:45:03,460 --> 14:45:05,300
Okay, again.

17280
14:45:05,520 --> 14:45:06,740
Let's go, let's go again.

17281
14:45:11,570 --> 14:45:13,340
He knows what to say.

17282
14:45:19,560 --> 14:45:20,620
It's okay.

17283
14:45:20,620 --> 14:45:20,900
It's okay.

17284
14:45:22,540 --> 14:45:25,100
I'm too easy to influence.

17285
14:45:25,360 --> 14:45:27,460
Thank you for the 10 subs.

17286
14:45:28,040 --> 14:45:29,740
Thank you, thank you.

17287
14:45:29,880 --> 14:45:32,040
I folded so easily.

17288
14:45:32,920 --> 14:45:35,540
I can...

17289
14:45:35,540 --> 14:45:37,140
I can fold.

17290
14:45:39,960 --> 14:45:40,540
Yes!

17291
14:45:41,000 --> 14:45:42,400
Oh my god.

17292
14:45:44,960 --> 14:45:47,300
Oh my god, oh my god.

17293
14:45:47,460 --> 14:45:48,220
I didn't even...

17294
14:45:48,220 --> 14:45:49,200
Okay, I didn't ask my mom.

17295
14:45:49,200 --> 14:45:50,140
I didn't even ask my...

17296
14:45:50,140 --> 14:45:51,940
My papa for this.

17297
14:45:52,380 --> 14:45:53,240
And...

17298
14:45:53,240 --> 14:45:53,860
They are...

17299
14:45:53,860 --> 14:45:54,400
They...

17300
14:45:54,400 --> 14:45:57,580
Oh my god, I don't know if they're actually watching this.

17301
14:45:58,460 --> 14:46:00,780
They already finished it.

17302
14:46:06,450 --> 14:46:09,650
They already made it.

17303
14:46:11,520 --> 14:46:13,070
Oh my god.

17304
14:46:13,690 --> 14:46:15,650
And then they messaged us like...

17305
14:46:15,650 --> 14:46:16,070
What was it?

17306
14:46:16,090 --> 14:46:17,690
22 hours ago.

17307
14:46:18,490 --> 14:46:19,350
Yes.

17308
14:46:21,820 --> 14:46:22,970
That's perfect.

17309
14:46:23,550 --> 14:46:24,450
It was messaged...

17310
14:46:24,450 --> 14:46:27,270
No, it was messaged like an hour ago.

17311
14:46:29,170 --> 14:46:30,200
Oh my god.

17312
14:46:34,770 --> 14:46:37,250
Oh my god.

17313
14:46:37,890 --> 14:46:39,930
They're like, good luck with the grind.

17314
14:46:40,830 --> 14:46:42,340
I love Marvel Rivals.

17315
14:46:43,330 --> 14:46:49,950
I love Marvel Rivals.

17316
14:46:51,890 --> 14:46:52,330
Listen.

17317
14:46:53,990 --> 14:46:55,870
This might be a team comp of all time.

17318
14:46:56,570 --> 14:46:57,910
Listen, unironically, unironically.

17319
14:46:58,690 --> 14:47:01,690
What if we ban Luna and we play Mantis Adam?

17320
14:47:03,170 --> 14:47:03,910
And we explode.

17321
14:47:04,230 --> 14:47:04,670
Actually, no.

17322
14:47:04,910 --> 14:47:05,310
Ban Hulk.

17323
14:47:06,070 --> 14:47:06,510
Revolutionary.

17324
14:47:07,370 --> 14:47:08,570
Wait, you don't have to ban Hulk.

17325
14:47:08,810 --> 14:47:09,890
I play Iron Man.

17326
14:47:11,010 --> 14:47:11,870
No, no, no Hulk.

17327
14:47:12,070 --> 14:47:12,510
Hawkeye.

17328
14:47:12,810 --> 14:47:13,190
Hawkeye.

17329
14:47:13,190 --> 14:47:15,030
Oh my god, here we go.

17330
14:47:15,350 --> 14:47:16,450
Are you banning Star-Lord?

17331
14:47:17,070 --> 14:47:17,730
Or did you pick him?

17332
14:47:18,610 --> 14:47:19,670
I'm a Star-Lord player.

17333
14:47:19,670 --> 14:47:22,070
What happened to Psylocke?

17334
14:47:23,990 --> 14:47:24,930
I'm banning Hela.

17335
14:47:25,850 --> 14:47:27,130
Yeah, what happened to Psylocke, SK?

17336
14:47:29,710 --> 14:47:31,050
SK is ignoring us.

17337
14:47:31,730 --> 14:47:32,230
What?

17338
14:47:32,950 --> 14:47:33,870
Can you not hear me?

17339
14:47:37,340 --> 14:47:37,980
What?

17340
14:47:38,220 --> 14:47:40,160
We have Psylocke!

17341
14:47:42,240 --> 14:47:43,940
We have Psylocke open.

17342
14:47:44,580 --> 14:47:45,960
Oh my god.

17343
14:47:46,500 --> 14:47:51,570
This is it.

17344
14:47:52,830 --> 14:47:54,570
Dr. Big Smack.

17345
14:47:55,790 --> 14:47:58,010
Please don't scream.

17346
14:47:58,010 --> 14:48:00,390
I'm gonna mute you.

17347
14:48:02,450 --> 14:48:03,630
What a fucking loser.

17348
14:48:05,150 --> 14:48:08,390
I just said we have Psy...

17349
14:48:08,390 --> 14:48:08,750
What?

17350
14:48:09,570 --> 14:48:12,070
I just said we have Psylocke.

17351
14:48:12,150 --> 14:48:12,730
What the fuck?

17352
14:48:13,190 --> 14:48:15,490
Oh, I'm sorry for showing emotions.

17353
14:48:15,830 --> 14:48:16,670
I'm sorry.

17354
14:48:17,030 --> 14:48:19,190
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

17355
14:48:19,190 --> 14:48:23,290
I'm sorry for showing fucking emotions in my games.

17356
14:48:23,630 --> 14:48:24,630
I just...

17357
14:48:24,630 --> 14:48:25,930
You know what I'd like to do on stream?

17358
14:48:26,330 --> 14:48:27,230
If they don't keep you.

17359
14:48:27,550 --> 14:48:30,030
You know like the thing where you're like here for the other stream to keep you, but they don't?

17360
14:48:30,030 --> 14:48:31,090
Yeah, like...

17361
14:48:31,090 --> 14:48:34,790
I just like to place the portals right in front of them when we're about to fight to ruin their frames.

17362
14:48:36,390 --> 14:48:37,350
Okay, I'll walk.

17363
14:48:37,710 --> 14:48:38,290
I'll walk.

17364
14:48:38,390 --> 14:48:39,190
I'm gonna walk.

17365
14:48:45,210 --> 14:48:46,350
Guys, this is it.

17366
14:48:49,190 --> 14:48:51,390
If I had a game where I did that, I might...

17367
14:48:51,390 --> 14:48:53,050
Maybe, maybe we'll make it.

17368
14:48:54,270 --> 14:48:55,630
Maybe we'll make it.

17369
14:48:55,630 --> 14:48:56,910
You should be ripping yourself more than the other team.

17370
14:48:58,550 --> 14:48:59,190
Oh my god.

17371
14:48:59,190 --> 14:49:00,070
That's much stranger.

17372
14:49:01,350 --> 14:49:02,150
I didn't think they would keep me.

17373
14:49:03,690 --> 14:49:05,030
Okay, I can do this.

17374
14:49:05,170 --> 14:49:06,090
Wait, this is EU.

17375
14:49:07,850 --> 14:49:08,970
This is EU.

17376
14:49:10,150 --> 14:49:10,730
Confuse them.

17377
14:49:12,630 --> 14:49:15,010
What I'd like to do is do both portals in front of them.

17378
14:49:16,170 --> 14:49:17,510
They're walking behind us.

17379
14:49:17,710 --> 14:49:18,470
They're walking behind us.

17380
14:49:18,470 --> 14:49:18,690
Wait.

17381
14:49:20,610 --> 14:49:21,690
Wait, I'm in EU.

17382
14:49:25,970 --> 14:49:26,510
Change on.

17383
14:49:27,290 --> 14:49:28,270
Change is on us.

17384
14:49:36,050 --> 14:49:36,810
Oh my god.

17385
14:49:39,350 --> 14:49:39,850
Change health.

17386
14:49:40,150 --> 14:49:40,570
I need reload.

17387
14:49:45,330 --> 14:49:46,510
Change is on us again.

17388
14:49:48,650 --> 14:49:49,690
I need help, I need help.

17389
14:49:51,230 --> 14:49:51,890
Change one.

17390
14:49:52,150 --> 14:49:53,850
He's low, he's low, but I'm really low too.

17391
14:49:55,590 --> 14:49:56,210
I'm changing a bit.

17392
14:49:58,590 --> 14:49:59,470
I'm gonna go Quinn.

17393
14:49:59,950 --> 14:50:00,470
I'm gonna go Quinn.

17394
14:50:01,110 --> 14:50:01,410
Okay.

17395
14:50:04,030 --> 14:50:05,410
I have change on me all.

17396
14:50:05,670 --> 14:50:06,610
Change is still on me.

17397
14:50:08,530 --> 14:50:10,410
What happened to my Adam?

17398
14:50:11,470 --> 14:50:11,950
Adam!

17399
14:50:13,290 --> 14:50:14,990
How did you fall?

17400
14:50:16,470 --> 14:50:19,210
How did you fall down?

17401
14:50:19,990 --> 14:50:22,310
I forgot about C.

17402
14:50:23,950 --> 14:50:26,050
Oh my god, you're right guys.

17403
14:50:26,510 --> 14:50:27,610
I have C.

17404
14:50:27,750 --> 14:50:32,430
I forgot I had a fucking Iron Fist because it felt like he never existed in my game.

17405
14:50:36,170 --> 14:50:38,270
It didn't feel like he was a person.

17406
14:50:39,190 --> 14:50:44,810
Sorry, it's hard to realize he exists when it feels like he does nothing.

17407
14:50:45,170 --> 14:50:46,290
He contributes nothing.

17408
14:50:47,310 --> 14:50:48,090
I don't know guys.

17409
14:50:56,130 --> 14:50:58,130
Sometimes I forget they're real people.

17410
14:51:05,900 --> 14:51:06,380
Green?

17411
14:51:07,420 --> 14:51:07,900
Green.

17412
14:51:08,940 --> 14:51:13,440
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

17413
14:51:13,460 --> 14:51:14,280
I'm ulting this.

17414
14:51:17,580 --> 14:51:18,940
Oh, we're so alive.

17415
14:51:20,920 --> 14:51:22,640
I'm pushing up.

17416
14:51:23,980 --> 14:51:24,940
Get predicted!

17417
14:51:27,200 --> 14:51:29,800
God, I'm fucking so good at video games.

17418
14:51:29,940 --> 14:51:31,560
I should get the mag.

17419
14:51:32,980 --> 14:51:34,120
Mag is awesome.

17420
14:51:34,960 --> 14:51:35,420
Awesome.

17421
14:51:37,740 --> 14:51:38,620
Nice goal.

17422
14:51:39,340 --> 14:51:40,200
Oh my god.

17423
14:51:41,660 --> 14:51:43,400
The most humble streamer right there.

17424
14:51:43,460 --> 14:51:44,140
Did you guys see that?

17425
14:51:46,540 --> 14:51:47,060
What?

17426
14:51:48,120 --> 14:51:49,300
Oh, TP, TP bot!

17427
14:51:57,040 --> 14:51:58,020
Dude, it's fine.

17428
14:51:59,520 --> 14:52:00,920
I have Magneto on me.

17429
14:52:02,060 --> 14:52:03,020
I died.

17430
14:52:07,070 --> 14:52:08,870
Oh my god.

17431
14:52:10,770 --> 14:52:11,930
Guys, I pressed C.

17432
14:52:12,470 --> 14:52:13,730
Did you guys see that?

17433
14:52:15,890 --> 14:52:17,390
I did it, guys.

17434
14:52:18,430 --> 14:52:19,470
I pressed C.

17435
14:52:20,850 --> 14:52:21,730
Did you guys see that?

17436
14:52:26,660 --> 14:52:27,500
I know, it's crazy.

17437
14:52:27,700 --> 14:52:28,280
I did the thing.

17438
14:52:31,940 --> 14:52:32,820
We're so bonded.

17439
14:52:37,850 --> 14:52:39,970
I throw a Psylocke behind us.

17440
14:52:44,510 --> 14:52:45,310
Oh no!

17441
14:52:47,010 --> 14:52:47,710
Not with a bolt.

17442
14:52:48,710 --> 14:52:48,870
No!

17443
14:52:51,830 --> 14:52:52,770
Okay, okay, okay.

17444
14:52:52,770 --> 14:52:53,570
Adam, do you play?

17445
14:52:54,310 --> 14:52:54,730
No, not Adam.

17446
14:52:55,590 --> 14:52:56,290
It's fine to spend.

17447
14:52:56,510 --> 14:52:57,150
I think it's fine.

17448
14:52:58,010 --> 14:52:58,590
Yeah, it is fine.

17449
14:52:58,730 --> 14:52:59,870
Alright, time to go no more.

17450
14:53:01,150 --> 14:53:02,230
Yeah, that's good.

17451
14:53:02,410 --> 14:53:02,890
We should do that.

17452
14:53:03,490 --> 14:53:04,070
Oh no.

17453
14:53:09,090 --> 14:53:11,450
Alright, everything will be okay.

17454
14:53:14,410 --> 14:53:15,930
Okay, but what if it will be different?

17455
14:53:16,010 --> 14:53:16,490
It could be different.

17456
14:53:16,590 --> 14:53:17,510
It will be different, guys.

17457
14:53:17,590 --> 14:53:18,190
It will be different.

17458
14:53:18,890 --> 14:53:19,750
It can be different.

17459
14:53:33,870 --> 14:53:36,810
I'm traumatized in the situation I'm in.

17460
14:53:37,630 --> 14:53:38,250
They swamped you.

17461
14:53:40,710 --> 14:53:41,390
I'm ulting.

17462
14:53:43,930 --> 14:53:44,410
How?

17463
14:53:46,510 --> 14:53:46,990
How?

17464
14:53:47,790 --> 14:53:48,310
I got nobody.

17465
14:53:49,070 --> 14:53:49,950
I got somebody.

17466
14:53:51,530 --> 14:53:57,750
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

17467
14:53:57,810 --> 14:53:58,710
I need a big ult.

17468
14:53:59,450 --> 14:54:02,230
I have Magnius behind me.

17469
14:54:05,010 --> 14:54:06,190
Magnius one, Magnius one.

17470
14:54:06,370 --> 14:54:06,910
He's so low.

17471
14:54:07,230 --> 14:54:07,810
I'm dead, I'm dead.

17472
14:54:09,950 --> 14:54:10,890
You got this, guys.

17473
14:54:11,330 --> 14:54:12,570
I'm really low, though.

17474
14:54:14,550 --> 14:54:16,350
I'm like one hit.

17475
14:54:19,900 --> 14:54:21,760
He's already dead, by the way.

17476
14:54:23,800 --> 14:54:24,860
Oh my god.

17477
14:54:25,920 --> 14:54:27,640
Where's my other support?

17478
14:54:30,240 --> 14:54:31,820
Do they exist?

17479
14:54:33,340 --> 14:54:36,560
Are they with me?

17480
14:54:38,400 --> 14:54:39,900
They have strange ult.

17481
14:54:40,780 --> 14:54:41,380
Strange ult.

17482
14:54:46,010 --> 14:54:46,830
There's Namor behind you.

17483
14:54:46,890 --> 14:54:47,390
Namor's behind.

17484
14:54:48,990 --> 14:54:49,530
Change health.

17485
14:54:50,330 --> 14:54:51,150
Change one, change one.

17486
14:54:51,330 --> 14:54:51,710
Change health.

17487
14:54:51,950 --> 14:54:52,350
Health, health, health.

17488
14:54:52,530 --> 14:54:53,130
1 HP, 1 HP.

17489
14:54:53,430 --> 14:54:54,450
1 HP, 1 HP, 1 HP.

17490
14:54:54,570 --> 14:54:55,530
Namor's behind us again.

17491
14:54:55,730 --> 14:54:56,030
Nice.

17492
14:54:56,830 --> 14:54:57,730
Namor's behind us.

17493
14:55:00,570 --> 14:55:01,190
I have Psylocke.

17494
14:55:01,230 --> 14:55:01,970
Psylocke is doing this.

17495
14:55:02,550 --> 14:55:03,030
I'm having health.

17496
14:55:05,010 --> 14:55:05,530
Namor's one.

17497
14:55:15,380 --> 14:55:16,140
Pushing in, pushing in.

17498
14:55:16,240 --> 14:55:16,840
We need to help.

17499
14:55:17,160 --> 14:55:18,620
We need to help SK after this.

17500
14:55:20,540 --> 14:55:21,440
I need heal from Namor.

17501
14:55:21,440 --> 14:55:21,800
I got both.

17502
14:55:22,780 --> 14:55:23,560
I'm about to ult this.

17503
14:55:23,660 --> 14:55:24,140
I'm about to ult this.

17504
14:55:25,040 --> 14:55:25,380
Yeah, yeah.

17505
14:55:25,380 --> 14:55:25,780
Go, go, go.

17506
14:55:25,980 --> 14:55:26,320
We win this.

17507
14:55:26,400 --> 14:55:27,000
Go on support, I think.

17508
14:55:27,820 --> 14:55:28,300
Namor's right.

17509
14:55:29,720 --> 14:55:32,020
I got one, I got one.

17510
14:55:34,040 --> 14:55:35,680
3, 2, 1.

17511
14:55:37,040 --> 14:55:37,860
I'm dead here.

17512
14:55:38,540 --> 14:55:39,280
Do we have item ult?

17513
14:55:40,520 --> 14:55:41,420
Oh, it's coming.

17514
14:55:41,680 --> 14:55:44,020
I got one.

17515
14:55:45,040 --> 14:55:46,840
Our item's getting harassed by Psylocke.

17516
14:55:46,980 --> 14:55:47,560
We need to die.

17517
14:55:47,780 --> 14:55:48,740
I'm one, I'm one, I'm one, I'm one.

17518
14:55:49,000 --> 14:55:49,600
Alright, alright.

17519
14:55:50,480 --> 14:55:51,040
Yeah, it's fine.

17520
14:55:52,420 --> 14:55:53,260
Oh, we're low key stunned.

17521
14:55:54,340 --> 14:55:55,360
Namor is half, Namor is half.

17522
14:55:56,720 --> 14:55:57,520
We have a lot of movement.

17523
14:55:58,560 --> 14:55:59,960
We need to touch, we need to touch.

17524
14:56:00,300 --> 14:56:01,260
I'm touching, I'm touching.

17525
14:56:01,260 --> 14:56:01,600
Namor's dead.

17526
14:56:01,900 --> 14:56:02,560
I'm dead though.

17527
14:56:04,420 --> 14:56:04,900
I'm coming back.

17528
14:56:08,020 --> 14:56:09,100
I'm almost there, I'm almost there.

17529
14:56:09,560 --> 14:56:10,540
We might need rez here.

17530
14:56:11,320 --> 14:56:11,920
I'm here, I'm here.

17531
14:56:14,020 --> 14:56:14,740
I can stay on point.

17532
14:56:15,740 --> 14:56:17,140
Tracer's pushing in.

17533
14:56:18,900 --> 14:56:19,840
Low key, low key.

17534
14:56:22,980 --> 14:56:23,460
I'm here.

17535
14:56:25,380 --> 14:56:26,640
Tracer, Tracer, Tracer, Tracer.

17536
14:56:28,160 --> 14:56:28,700
Tracer's half.

17537
14:56:28,720 --> 14:56:29,080
I have to reload.

17538
14:56:31,320 --> 14:56:32,140
They're half, they're half.

17539
14:56:32,420 --> 14:56:32,960
Tank's half.

17540
14:56:37,080 --> 14:56:38,460
Oh my god.

17541
14:56:43,080 --> 14:56:43,560
Our...

17542
14:56:43,560 --> 14:56:43,920
No.

17543
14:56:44,580 --> 14:56:45,300
Our item.

17544
14:56:45,300 --> 14:56:47,960
No, winnable, winnable, winnable, winnable.

17545
14:56:48,280 --> 14:56:48,820
Our item.

17546
14:56:49,780 --> 14:56:52,300
Our item.

17547
14:56:57,440 --> 14:56:58,980
That's all I'll say.

17548
14:57:05,040 --> 14:57:06,800
I saw our item.

17549
14:57:07,020 --> 14:57:10,800
I keep trying to kill a Psylocke for 20 years.

17550
14:57:18,200 --> 14:57:20,620
No you didn't, you fucking liar.

17551
14:57:21,180 --> 14:57:24,460
I spectated you, you fucking liar.

17552
14:57:26,920 --> 14:57:30,280
Isaac, you're such a fucking liar.

17553
14:57:34,400 --> 14:57:36,100
You're such a liar.

17554
14:57:37,600 --> 14:57:39,080
Now we all have someone to blame.

17555
14:57:40,320 --> 14:57:41,760
Call him out.

17556
14:57:41,760 --> 14:57:45,500
The lies people tell.

17557
14:57:46,560 --> 14:57:50,120
I fucking saw what you did.

17558
14:57:53,060 --> 14:57:54,600
You're a liar.

17559
14:57:54,880 --> 14:57:56,060
You're such a liar.

17560
14:58:02,280 --> 14:58:03,680
He could...

17561
14:58:03,680 --> 14:58:04,980
He could run.

17562
14:58:05,220 --> 14:58:06,260
I ran.

17563
14:58:07,680 --> 14:58:10,500
I saw what you did last summer.

17564
14:58:15,240 --> 14:58:17,000
I know what you were.

17565
14:58:35,480 --> 14:58:37,400
Oh my god.

17566
14:58:39,360 --> 14:58:40,420
Psylocke's inting.

17567
14:58:41,020 --> 14:58:42,280
Jesus Christ.

17568
14:58:43,440 --> 14:58:44,760
Jesus Christ, okay.

17569
14:58:47,240 --> 14:58:48,480
Ivan, they're more behind us.

17570
14:58:50,880 --> 14:58:52,320
They're more still behind us.

17571
14:58:55,880 --> 14:58:56,700
I'm arched, man.

17572
14:58:56,900 --> 14:58:57,280
I'm dead.

17573
14:59:00,300 --> 14:59:00,960
Trained one.

17574
14:59:04,810 --> 14:59:05,830
Oh my god.

17575
14:59:07,330 --> 14:59:08,010
Our item's gonna die.

17576
14:59:11,430 --> 14:59:11,910
Okay.

17577
14:59:13,550 --> 14:59:15,330
How did we just let him do that?

17578
14:59:16,010 --> 14:59:17,090
How did we just...

17579
14:59:19,310 --> 14:59:19,830
Guys.

17580
14:59:20,430 --> 14:59:22,330
How did we just let him do that?

17581
14:59:22,890 --> 14:59:23,290
How?

17582
14:59:30,090 --> 14:59:32,510
How did we just let him do that?

17583
14:59:34,870 --> 14:59:35,770
I froze him.

17584
14:59:45,200 --> 14:59:46,340
Will we be...

17585
14:59:46,340 --> 14:59:47,800
I don't think we'll be okay.

17586
14:59:48,020 --> 14:59:48,660
I don't...

17587
14:59:49,820 --> 14:59:50,860
Guys, I...

17588
14:59:51,440 --> 14:59:53,300
I don't think we'll be okay.

17589
14:59:53,300 --> 14:59:53,740
I...

17590
14:59:54,250 --> 14:59:55,300
This is not it.

17591
14:59:55,440 --> 14:59:55,980
This...

17592
14:59:55,980 --> 14:59:57,300
This is not it.

17593
15:00:03,180 --> 15:00:03,760
Guys.

17594
15:00:05,630 --> 15:00:07,460
I wanna save my ult for after they win ult.

17595
15:00:07,700 --> 15:00:08,300
I think.

17596
15:00:15,590 --> 15:00:17,590
Was that even me?

17597
15:00:18,150 --> 15:00:23,010
What does that even mean?

17598
15:00:23,170 --> 15:00:24,030
I think you have to build up.

17599
15:00:29,930 --> 15:00:31,770
Build up for 15...

17600
15:00:31,770 --> 15:00:32,590
Our 15...

17601
15:00:32,590 --> 15:00:34,510
Oh, that would've been so cool if I hit that.

17602
15:00:34,590 --> 15:00:35,550
That was literally like...

17603
15:00:36,190 --> 15:00:36,790
Hell Mary.

17604
15:00:42,340 --> 15:00:44,960
That would've been so cool.

17605
15:00:49,040 --> 15:00:49,600
Ooh.

17606
15:00:50,100 --> 15:00:50,620
Oh!

17607
15:00:51,000 --> 15:00:52,360
They broke the bridge!

17608
15:00:54,140 --> 15:00:54,680
I helped.

17609
15:00:56,740 --> 15:00:57,900
We could win this.

17610
15:00:57,900 --> 15:00:58,540
No.

17611
15:00:59,880 --> 15:01:01,020
Alright, here we go.

17612
15:01:01,220 --> 15:01:01,600
Change one.

17613
15:01:01,840 --> 15:01:02,320
Change one.

17614
15:01:05,720 --> 15:01:08,800
Oh, you can ult after this one.

17615
15:01:17,220 --> 15:01:17,780
Fear.

17616
15:01:20,720 --> 15:01:21,280
Fear.

17617
15:01:22,800 --> 15:01:23,700
Still fear.

17618
15:01:24,460 --> 15:01:25,520
Still fear.

17619
15:01:26,920 --> 15:01:27,480
TB!

17620
15:01:27,700 --> 15:01:27,700
TB!

17621
15:01:27,760 --> 15:01:27,840
TB!

17622
15:01:27,980 --> 15:01:28,020
TB!

17623
15:01:28,020 --> 15:01:28,040
TB!

17624
15:01:41,980 --> 15:01:44,180
Oh my god.

17625
15:01:44,220 --> 15:01:45,160
Oh my god!

17626
15:01:45,200 --> 15:01:46,260
Hello, everybody!

17627
15:01:47,580 --> 15:01:48,100
Alright.

17628
15:01:48,600 --> 15:01:50,080
Here I go again.

17629
15:01:50,240 --> 15:01:50,840
Okay.

17630
15:01:59,430 --> 15:02:01,630
Wait, we didn't even get a tick?

17631
15:02:02,890 --> 15:02:03,590
Guys, I just...

17632
15:02:05,990 --> 15:02:06,670
Well...

17633
15:02:09,010 --> 15:02:09,690
Well...

17634
15:02:09,690 --> 15:02:10,970
I blame my...

17635
15:02:10,970 --> 15:02:12,850
I blame my Adam.

17636
15:02:13,510 --> 15:02:14,590
My Adam.

17637
15:02:14,850 --> 15:02:15,530
That's why I'm...

17638
15:02:18,950 --> 15:02:21,330
We saw what our Adam did.

17639
15:02:21,630 --> 15:02:23,530
We saw what our Adam did.

17640
15:02:24,110 --> 15:02:24,790
We...

17641
15:02:25,390 --> 15:02:26,650
We saw...

17642
15:02:31,410 --> 15:02:33,210
We saw our Adam.

17643
15:02:36,070 --> 15:02:37,210
The fuck is that ping?

17644
15:02:37,430 --> 15:02:38,510
Welcome to EU.

17645
15:02:41,950 --> 15:02:43,910
What was that Adam doing?

17646
15:02:44,470 --> 15:02:46,130
Oh yeah, I'm fucking avoiding that Adam.

17647
15:02:47,350 --> 15:02:47,850
That...

17648
15:02:48,180 --> 15:02:49,480
He was like...

17649
15:02:49,950 --> 15:02:50,540
He was like...

17650
15:02:51,690 --> 15:02:53,770
I just kept dying to Magneto.

17651
15:02:53,890 --> 15:02:55,290
I'm like, no, I saw what happened.

17652
15:02:55,510 --> 15:02:57,010
I saw what you did, Adam.

17653
15:02:57,270 --> 15:02:58,990
Don't fucking lie to me, Adam.

17654
15:02:58,990 --> 15:02:59,770
I...

17655
15:02:59,770 --> 15:03:01,050
I was there.

17656
15:03:02,670 --> 15:03:06,450
You thought nobody would spectate you.

17657
15:03:06,830 --> 15:03:07,930
Well, too bad.

17658
15:03:08,070 --> 15:03:08,930
I died.

17659
15:03:09,190 --> 15:03:10,450
I saw what happened.

17660
15:03:11,010 --> 15:03:14,230
I saw you fight that Psylocke for like...

17661
15:03:14,230 --> 15:03:15,570
Three whole minutes.

17662
15:03:16,230 --> 15:03:16,810
I...

17663
15:03:16,810 --> 15:03:19,010
Now everybody knows.

17664
15:03:23,810 --> 15:03:25,130
How cooked am I?

17665
15:03:27,050 --> 15:03:28,770
How cooked am I?

17666
15:03:30,290 --> 15:03:31,090
I...

17667
15:03:32,490 --> 15:03:34,190
Maybe we should call it a hundred.

17668
15:03:34,590 --> 15:03:36,810
Maybe we should call it...

17669
15:03:37,770 --> 15:03:40,530
Maybe we should call it at a hundred.

17670
15:03:49,630 --> 15:03:52,630
I'm at a hundred and thirteen.

17671
15:03:57,330 --> 15:03:59,230
What is this?

17672
15:04:00,830 --> 15:04:02,670
Okay, so a hundred.

17673
15:04:03,770 --> 15:04:04,470
Is that...

17674
15:04:04,470 --> 15:04:05,070
Oh wait, no.

17675
15:04:06,150 --> 15:04:09,210
JK, I'm at a hundred and five.

17676
15:04:09,470 --> 15:04:09,950
We...

17677
15:04:09,950 --> 15:04:11,030
We did it.

17678
15:04:19,090 --> 15:04:21,770
Oh my god, we did it!

17679
15:04:22,630 --> 15:04:23,390
We...

17680
15:04:24,810 --> 15:04:26,630
We did it, guys.

17681
15:04:27,290 --> 15:04:28,790
We made it.

17682
15:04:31,230 --> 15:04:34,050
I do not have five points to spend.

17683
15:04:34,610 --> 15:04:36,270
Oh my god.

17684
15:04:39,570 --> 15:04:40,710
I can't.

17685
15:04:40,810 --> 15:04:42,070
What if we lose it?

17686
15:04:42,830 --> 15:04:44,550
What if we lose it, though?

17687
15:04:45,550 --> 15:04:51,830
We go again later today slash your tomorrow.

17688
15:04:53,480 --> 15:04:54,870
Oh, never mind.

17689
15:04:55,010 --> 15:04:55,670
Let's...

17690
15:04:55,670 --> 15:04:56,150
Let's go.

17691
15:05:10,370 --> 15:05:12,470
We got a third.

17692
15:05:17,210 --> 15:05:19,390
No, let's freaking go.

17693
15:05:20,090 --> 15:05:21,590
Let me...

17694
15:05:21,590 --> 15:05:24,890
Let me walk my dog first.

17695
15:05:25,490 --> 15:05:25,870
Wait.

17696
15:05:29,670 --> 15:05:32,190
Give me ten minutes.

17697
15:05:32,270 --> 15:05:34,190
Guys, I'm walking my dog.

17698
15:05:34,470 --> 15:05:36,450
I'm walking my dog.

17699
15:05:36,990 --> 15:05:38,870
I'll be right back, guys.

17700
15:05:39,550 --> 15:05:41,010
I'll be right back.

17701
15:05:42,390 --> 15:05:44,730
Walking my dog.

17702
15:05:44,870 --> 15:05:46,010
Give me...

17703
15:05:46,890 --> 15:05:49,250
Be right back.

17704
15:05:50,930 --> 15:05:51,870
I'm dumb.

17705
15:05:52,150 --> 15:05:55,230
I'm so easy to manipulate.

17706
15:05:55,770 --> 15:05:57,090
I'll be right back.

17707
15:16:41,970 --> 15:16:43,450
Alright, I'm back.

17708
15:16:43,750 --> 15:16:44,290
I'm...

17709
15:16:44,290 --> 15:16:45,330
I'm back.

17710
15:16:46,950 --> 15:16:48,530
How was the circus?

17711
15:16:49,410 --> 15:16:50,710
How was it, everybody?

17712
15:16:50,710 --> 15:16:53,650
Did you guys have a great time at the circus?

17713
15:16:57,370 --> 15:16:58,610
Oh my god.

17714
15:16:58,970 --> 15:16:59,590
Okay.

17715
15:17:00,690 --> 15:17:01,390
Okay.

17716
15:17:01,790 --> 15:17:02,990
I'm back.

17717
15:17:06,310 --> 15:17:12,150
I have 351 points.

17718
15:17:12,910 --> 15:17:18,150
We're gonna make sure you lose one above all.

17719
15:17:28,110 --> 15:17:28,750
Okay.

17720
15:17:28,770 --> 15:17:29,390
Okay, no.

17721
15:17:36,470 --> 15:17:39,090
How long would Q's even be?

17722
15:17:40,350 --> 15:17:40,930
How...

17723
15:17:40,930 --> 15:17:41,890
Bro, okay.

17724
15:17:41,990 --> 15:17:44,470
If I was at 350, I'd be fucking out.

17725
15:17:44,870 --> 15:17:46,370
I don't install Marvel Rivals.

17726
15:17:46,610 --> 15:17:47,370
What the hell?

17727
15:17:48,830 --> 15:17:49,510
I...

17728
15:17:49,510 --> 15:17:50,550
I...

17729
15:17:50,550 --> 15:17:52,770
Marvel Rivals is...

17730
15:17:52,770 --> 15:17:56,670
It's gonna be uninstalled if I had 350, guys.

17731
15:17:57,330 --> 15:17:58,710
What the fuck?

17732
15:18:00,470 --> 15:18:01,150
Alright.

17733
15:18:01,970 --> 15:18:03,430
Are we waiting for Bulgar?

17734
15:18:04,930 --> 15:18:05,590
It's okay, guys.

17735
15:18:05,650 --> 15:18:06,090
I believe.

17736
15:18:07,470 --> 15:18:08,150
Yes.

17737
15:18:08,650 --> 15:18:11,330
Yes, he has been walked.

17738
15:18:11,950 --> 15:18:13,090
I've hit my third win.

17739
15:18:14,050 --> 15:18:15,990
I didn't think it'd be possible.

17740
15:18:16,770 --> 15:18:17,970
But I...

17741
15:18:18,770 --> 15:18:20,150
I've hit my third win.

17742
15:18:20,650 --> 15:18:23,650
I legitimately did not think I could actually do that.

17743
15:18:24,770 --> 15:18:25,330
Third.

17744
15:18:26,110 --> 15:18:32,390
Also, if you guys have been watching the past 15 hours, please head to bed.

17745
15:18:32,510 --> 15:18:34,390
You're not crazy as me right now.

17746
15:18:34,410 --> 15:18:36,890
I'm literally going through pure adrenaline right now.

17747
15:18:36,970 --> 15:18:38,210
Pure rank adrenaline.

17748
15:18:39,010 --> 15:18:39,990
And like...

17749
15:18:41,470 --> 15:18:42,030
Madigan...

17750
15:18:42,030 --> 15:18:42,210
Shit!

17751
15:18:45,190 --> 15:18:46,030
Yes.

17752
15:18:46,850 --> 15:18:47,690
Yes.

17753
15:18:48,390 --> 15:18:49,230
Yes.

17754
15:18:49,230 --> 15:18:49,450
Yes.

17755
15:18:49,450 --> 15:18:51,410
I'm locked in.

17756
15:18:51,970 --> 15:18:53,130
I'm locked up.

17757
15:18:53,430 --> 15:18:54,270
Legitimately.

17758
15:18:54,950 --> 15:18:56,250
Madic energy right now.

17759
15:18:56,430 --> 15:18:57,830
And I keep going.

17760
15:18:58,250 --> 15:19:00,810
I need the win.

17761
15:19:02,630 --> 15:19:05,090
Please head to bed if you're tired.

17762
15:19:05,570 --> 15:19:07,610
If you're tired and...

17763
15:19:08,170 --> 15:19:09,930
And you need sleep.

17764
15:19:10,170 --> 15:19:11,290
Take sleep.

17765
15:19:12,610 --> 15:19:13,230
Guys...

17766
15:19:14,110 --> 15:19:14,420
Don't...

17767
15:19:14,850 --> 15:19:15,470
Don't...

17768
15:19:15,470 --> 15:19:16,870
Don't do this to yourself.

17769
15:19:17,230 --> 15:19:18,550
Don't be like me.

17770
15:19:19,690 --> 15:19:21,490
Don't be like me.

17771
15:19:23,930 --> 15:19:25,270
Oh my god, guys!

17772
15:19:25,370 --> 15:19:26,670
Oh, never mind.

17773
15:19:27,210 --> 15:19:27,770
We were...

17774
15:19:27,770 --> 15:19:29,690
I had to walk my dog.

17775
15:19:30,090 --> 15:19:32,590
But we were the number one Marvel rival stream.

17776
15:19:33,110 --> 15:19:34,350
For a second.

17777
15:19:34,990 --> 15:19:36,590
We were there!

17778
15:19:37,230 --> 15:19:38,770
Oh my god, I'm actually proud of us.

17779
15:19:38,850 --> 15:19:40,210
I'm actually so happy.

17780
15:19:40,790 --> 15:19:41,350
Wow.

17781
15:19:42,150 --> 15:19:44,130
Alright, how long would the queues be though?

17782
15:19:44,230 --> 15:19:44,810
To be fair.

17783
15:19:46,090 --> 15:19:47,050
We were there!

17784
15:19:47,290 --> 15:19:49,470
We were the number one Marvel rival stream!

17785
15:19:49,850 --> 15:19:50,410
Everybody...

17786
15:19:50,410 --> 15:19:52,490
I hope everybody saw that fucker nubs.

17787
15:19:52,650 --> 15:19:52,990
I...

17788
15:19:52,990 --> 15:19:55,330
I'm not over it.

17789
15:19:56,090 --> 15:19:57,190
I'm not over...

17790
15:19:57,190 --> 15:19:58,710
I hope we all saw that.

17791
15:19:58,750 --> 15:20:00,570
I hope we all saw that guy.

17792
15:20:00,750 --> 15:20:01,690
Fuck that guy.

17793
15:20:02,170 --> 15:20:03,230
I hope he...

17794
15:20:03,230 --> 15:20:06,010
I hope he realizes I'm a streamer.

17795
15:20:06,170 --> 15:20:08,350
And then he reads the chat history.

17796
15:20:08,350 --> 15:20:10,710
And then he has a good rest of his Sunday.

17797
15:20:10,750 --> 15:20:12,930
And I hope that he has a good rest of his Sunday.

17798
15:20:13,210 --> 15:20:14,370
That's all I wish for him.

17799
15:20:14,770 --> 15:20:15,250
That's all.

17800
15:20:17,130 --> 15:20:18,170
You know.

17801
15:20:18,630 --> 15:20:21,550
I hope he has a good Sunday after that.

17802
15:20:22,150 --> 15:20:23,790
I hope he has a great day.

17803
15:20:24,170 --> 15:20:25,370
Keep himself safe.

17804
15:20:28,450 --> 15:20:30,030
Nubs was like 8!

17805
15:20:30,050 --> 15:20:31,270
Don't say that.

17806
15:20:32,030 --> 15:20:34,130
No, there's no way he was...

17807
15:20:34,130 --> 15:20:34,650
No.

17808
15:20:35,590 --> 15:20:36,710
There's no way.

17809
15:20:36,710 --> 15:20:39,290
There's no fucking way.

17810
15:20:41,230 --> 15:20:42,850
There's no way.

17811
15:20:43,170 --> 15:20:45,450
It was not 8 hours ago.

17812
15:20:45,950 --> 15:20:48,450
It was not 8 hours ago.

17813
15:20:49,830 --> 15:20:52,250
I still refuse to believe it.

17814
15:20:53,590 --> 15:20:55,530
Guys, I touched grass.

17815
15:20:55,690 --> 15:20:57,670
You cannot say I didn't touch grass.

17816
15:20:58,210 --> 15:20:59,530
I did it.

17817
15:21:01,510 --> 15:21:03,790
Games can't be this bad now, right?

17818
15:21:04,630 --> 15:21:04,950
Right?

17819
15:21:05,110 --> 15:21:05,990
There's no way.

17820
15:21:07,230 --> 15:21:08,710
There's no way.

17821
15:21:08,990 --> 15:21:11,550
Now that Helios is on his main account.

17822
15:21:12,530 --> 15:21:14,030
It can't get worse.

17823
15:21:15,490 --> 15:21:17,670
You know, I think top 16...

17824
15:21:17,670 --> 15:21:19,070
That's way too high.

17825
15:21:20,330 --> 15:21:22,590
We should take him down to top 100.

17826
15:21:24,050 --> 15:21:25,070
But like not...

17827
15:21:25,070 --> 15:21:27,630
Not like, you know, purposely or anything.

17828
15:21:27,870 --> 15:21:28,210
You know?

17829
15:21:28,550 --> 15:21:29,950
Not on purpose.

17830
15:21:30,390 --> 15:21:31,070
Just...

17831
15:21:31,070 --> 15:21:32,430
It could be a little funny.

17832
15:21:33,830 --> 15:21:35,170
We all suffer together.

17833
15:21:37,850 --> 15:21:39,050
One thing.

17834
15:21:42,030 --> 15:21:43,110
It could be a little funny.

17835
15:21:43,150 --> 15:21:46,190
But then we'll give him back top 16 too.

17836
15:21:51,700 --> 15:21:53,920
Alright, let's see how these games are gonna...

17837
15:21:53,920 --> 15:21:54,220
Why?

17838
15:21:56,500 --> 15:21:59,440
Why is there a GM 1 and 3?

17839
15:22:02,480 --> 15:22:06,360
Why is there a GM 3 in our lobby?

17840
15:22:09,900 --> 15:22:12,120
This guy... We have a top 16!

17841
15:22:17,470 --> 15:22:19,070
How did he get in here?

17842
15:22:19,130 --> 15:22:20,210
Oh, he must be dueling with...

17843
15:22:20,210 --> 15:22:23,390
He must be dueling with an attorney player.

17844
15:22:25,390 --> 15:22:28,670
There's no way he has to be dueling with somebody in here.

17845
15:22:32,460 --> 15:22:33,500
Who's not loaded in?

17846
15:22:34,600 --> 15:22:35,220
It's this guy.

17847
15:22:39,560 --> 15:22:40,520
MRC Champion.

17848
15:22:40,760 --> 15:22:41,740
Oh, did they win?

17849
15:22:43,800 --> 15:22:45,180
Did Helios' team win?

17850
15:22:51,300 --> 15:22:53,060
Oh my god!

17851
15:22:53,220 --> 15:22:54,780
Helios, what the fuck?

17852
15:22:59,300 --> 15:23:00,620
Where's the carry?

17853
15:23:00,920 --> 15:23:01,540
I'm joking.

17854
15:23:01,940 --> 15:23:02,900
I'm joking.

17855
15:23:03,800 --> 15:23:04,240
I'm joking.

17856
15:23:14,390 --> 15:23:16,290
I'm Luna Snow.

17857
15:23:16,930 --> 15:23:19,390
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

17858
15:23:20,210 --> 15:23:24,770
If we don't ban it, then Toki might eat the record.

17859
15:23:25,390 --> 15:23:27,950
I can go Magneto.

17860
15:23:31,550 --> 15:23:34,030
Oh my god, Helios is...

17861
15:23:34,030 --> 15:23:36,070
Bro, you can't say that!

17862
15:23:37,550 --> 15:23:39,270
For the flowers!

17863
15:23:41,530 --> 15:23:45,330
Guys, we should try to be nice to the people that play with us right now.

17864
15:23:45,330 --> 15:23:49,330
If we want this to end, we gotta...

17865
15:23:50,330 --> 15:23:55,110
Try to be nice to the people that's gonna take us to the end.

17866
15:24:02,910 --> 15:24:04,250
We got this.

17867
15:24:06,850 --> 15:24:09,310
We don't want it to...

17868
15:24:09,310 --> 15:24:10,630
Young, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

17869
15:24:10,670 --> 15:24:11,450
Thank you.

17870
15:24:11,690 --> 15:24:15,410
Thank you for the tier 1 sub too.

17871
15:24:15,890 --> 15:24:18,730
For fuck's sake, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

17872
15:24:20,630 --> 15:24:21,950
I really appreciate it.

17873
15:24:24,670 --> 15:24:26,950
Oh my god, maybe this time it'll work.

17874
15:24:30,970 --> 15:24:33,010
It's okay guys, I'm going on my third wind.

17875
15:24:35,170 --> 15:24:37,770
I'm on my magic energy third wind.

17876
15:24:38,130 --> 15:24:40,650
Do you play... do you play sick... not so... what?

17877
15:24:40,830 --> 15:24:41,190
Strange?

17878
15:24:41,390 --> 15:24:42,130
Do you play Strange?

17879
15:24:42,890 --> 15:24:43,330
Me?

17880
15:24:44,150 --> 15:24:45,030
Yeah, you.

17881
15:24:45,230 --> 15:24:45,230
Me?

17882
15:24:45,250 --> 15:24:47,230
No, no, I'm supposed to be sucking with Strange.

17883
15:24:47,810 --> 15:24:49,370
Okay, okay, you are the mad guy.

17884
15:24:50,090 --> 15:24:51,490
It's fine though, Magic is okay by me.

17885
15:24:54,110 --> 15:24:55,410
I'm not the mad guy.

17886
15:24:56,270 --> 15:24:58,050
I'm not the mad guy, it's the minor.

17887
15:24:58,350 --> 15:25:00,530
It's not Doom queuing if we're winning!

17888
15:25:01,230 --> 15:25:02,730
I just mean...

17889
15:25:02,730 --> 15:25:04,950
By like two games, we're up two games.

17890
15:25:05,790 --> 15:25:11,850
Guys, I know it's been 15 hours and we're up two games and it might not be the best record ever.

17891
15:25:12,430 --> 15:25:14,230
But like...

17892
15:25:14,230 --> 15:25:15,950
We're still up.

17893
15:25:16,290 --> 15:25:18,230
We're still up, guys.

17894
15:25:20,510 --> 15:25:21,710
You have Iron Man 2, no?

17895
15:25:22,770 --> 15:25:24,730
No, we're up two games.

17896
15:25:25,430 --> 15:25:27,110
I still feel nothing about this on my side.

17897
15:25:27,450 --> 15:25:33,250
So I'm probably gonna have a big lag and can play for maybe... 56?

17898
15:25:33,250 --> 15:25:33,870
That's insane.

17899
15:25:35,030 --> 15:25:35,110
Okay.

17900
15:25:36,070 --> 15:25:36,550
So...

17901
15:25:36,550 --> 15:25:37,350
It's already cast.

17902
15:25:37,810 --> 15:25:38,470
Sorry, boys.

17903
15:25:42,210 --> 15:25:45,710
Actually, I see absolutely no one.

17904
15:25:46,450 --> 15:25:47,150
Oh...

17905
15:25:49,250 --> 15:25:52,230
You're a turret, you're a turret, okay?

17906
15:26:00,390 --> 15:26:01,790
Oh...

17907
15:26:01,790 --> 15:26:03,190
That's awkward.

17908
15:26:05,390 --> 15:26:06,790
That's...

17909
15:26:06,790 --> 15:26:07,870
Ooh...

17910
15:26:08,710 --> 15:26:09,830
That's...

17911
15:26:09,830 --> 15:26:11,550
Ooh...

17912
15:26:11,550 --> 15:26:12,470
That's awkward.

17913
15:26:12,470 --> 15:26:12,650
That's...

17914
15:26:15,750 --> 15:26:16,470
I...

17915
15:26:16,470 --> 15:26:18,350
I healed our cloak.

17916
15:26:18,490 --> 15:26:20,550
I don't know if you saw that, but...

17917
15:26:22,110 --> 15:26:23,630
But our cloak...

17918
15:26:24,830 --> 15:26:28,310
Got healed as much as he was possible.

17919
15:26:30,050 --> 15:26:30,470
I...

17920
15:26:30,470 --> 15:26:31,870
Honestly, I respect it.

17921
15:26:32,150 --> 15:26:32,790
We still play though.

17922
15:26:35,830 --> 15:26:36,870
Oh my god.

17923
15:26:37,510 --> 15:26:38,890
I'm a little worried here.

17924
15:26:39,670 --> 15:26:39,830
Oh!

17925
15:26:41,110 --> 15:26:41,830
Yay!

17926
15:26:41,830 --> 15:26:42,050
Yay!

17927
15:26:48,600 --> 15:26:48,890
Yay!

17928
15:26:54,480 --> 15:26:55,760
We did it.

17929
15:26:55,840 --> 15:26:56,740
No, no, no.

17930
15:26:56,760 --> 15:26:58,420
That can't be a sign, right?

17931
15:26:59,940 --> 15:27:01,620
That can't be a sign.

17932
15:27:01,780 --> 15:27:02,680
There's no way.

17933
15:27:03,100 --> 15:27:03,780
There's no...

17934
15:27:04,300 --> 15:27:07,660
That's not God sending me a message that I should stop.

17935
15:27:07,800 --> 15:27:08,400
That's... no.

17936
15:27:09,200 --> 15:27:11,780
If he really wanted me to stop...

17937
15:27:11,780 --> 15:27:16,120
He would make sure the next game would be a DC too.

17938
15:27:16,460 --> 15:27:18,620
But like, in the beginning, so I don't lose anything.

17939
15:27:19,020 --> 15:27:20,100
So like...

17940
15:27:20,580 --> 15:27:27,120
If it really was a message from above, a divine intervention, then...

17941
15:27:28,440 --> 15:27:31,800
Then, it would happen a second time.

17942
15:27:36,840 --> 15:27:38,400
The first time...

17943
15:27:38,400 --> 15:27:40,240
The first time is just coincidence.

17944
15:27:40,240 --> 15:27:43,440
The second time, then maybe something is weird.

17945
15:27:50,250 --> 15:27:52,810
Is it the same people or different?

17946
15:27:55,770 --> 15:27:56,870
Okay, this looks a little better.

17947
15:27:57,910 --> 15:28:00,050
This looks a little better.

17948
15:28:01,710 --> 15:28:03,530
I feel so confident.

17949
15:28:09,270 --> 15:28:10,670
Get out.

17950
15:28:10,670 --> 15:28:10,710
Cool,

17951
15:28:15,590 --> 15:28:17,350
am I gonna vanish for this match?

17952
15:28:18,890 --> 15:28:20,030
I don't know those people too much.

17953
15:28:20,390 --> 15:28:22,490
But, they probably ban the crazy characters.

17954
15:28:24,050 --> 15:28:25,570
Alright, can't be that bad.

17955
15:28:30,080 --> 15:28:31,360
Can't be that bad.

17956
15:28:35,530 --> 15:28:36,350
Oh my.

17957
15:28:37,370 --> 15:28:38,550
Yeah, that's what I like to see.

17958
15:28:39,250 --> 15:28:39,710
They ban Hela.

17959
15:28:40,670 --> 15:28:41,630
Slowly maxing?

17960
15:28:42,010 --> 15:28:43,670
Yeah, but we cannot risk it.

17961
15:28:46,230 --> 15:28:46,710
Who's...

17962
15:28:49,680 --> 15:28:51,060
Are they min-maxing?

17963
15:28:51,500 --> 15:28:52,260
The editing team?

17964
15:28:54,700 --> 15:28:55,080
No.

17965
15:28:56,140 --> 15:28:59,100
I'm definitely not min-maxing right now.

17966
15:28:59,820 --> 15:29:00,520
I'm not.

17967
15:29:05,720 --> 15:29:07,580
Alright, here we go again.

17968
15:29:11,080 --> 15:29:11,680
Guys.

17969
15:29:12,840 --> 15:29:14,260
They said this is a little better.

17970
15:29:20,280 --> 15:29:22,160
Alright, this is alright.

17971
15:29:22,540 --> 15:29:23,860
I can fuck with this.

17972
15:29:24,840 --> 15:29:26,460
I can fuck with this.

17973
15:29:27,320 --> 15:29:28,200
What can go wrong?

17974
15:29:29,460 --> 15:29:30,360
What can go wrong?

17975
15:29:31,480 --> 15:29:32,620
Absolutely nothing.

17976
15:29:38,420 --> 15:29:40,040
Nothing can go wrong.

17977
15:29:41,020 --> 15:29:44,740
If there is another divine intervention, he will do it again.

17978
15:29:52,500 --> 15:29:52,700
What?

17979
15:29:54,640 --> 15:29:56,820
Oh, they'll think he's Spider-Man.

17980
15:29:57,740 --> 15:29:58,040
Oh.

17981
15:30:01,200 --> 15:30:03,500
Wait, I think they're gonna...

17982
15:30:06,080 --> 15:30:07,220
That's fucked.

17983
15:30:08,000 --> 15:30:09,400
That's so fucked.

17984
15:30:13,820 --> 15:30:15,020
That's so fucked.

17985
15:30:16,660 --> 15:30:17,080
Alright, let's go.

17986
15:30:17,340 --> 15:30:18,380
She appreciates it.

17987
15:30:18,960 --> 15:30:19,300
Wait.

17988
15:30:19,900 --> 15:30:20,660
Wait, did he...

17989
15:30:20,660 --> 15:30:21,900
Wait, who said that?

17990
15:30:23,340 --> 15:30:25,500
I think you should put E on...

17991
15:30:26,300 --> 15:30:27,640
Wait, did he say...

17992
15:30:27,640 --> 15:30:28,800
Oh, he was my fan?

17993
15:30:29,340 --> 15:30:30,560
I don't expect that.

17994
15:30:36,840 --> 15:30:38,760
He said he was my fan?

17995
15:30:38,980 --> 15:30:40,060
I was...

17996
15:30:41,720 --> 15:30:42,260
Oh, nice.

17997
15:30:43,720 --> 15:30:44,560
Any heals?

17998
15:30:47,780 --> 15:30:48,940
I'm pushing in, I'm pushing in.

17999
15:30:54,520 --> 15:30:55,400
I'm not there.

18000
15:30:57,820 --> 15:30:58,940
Look at mine, look at mine, look at mine.

18001
15:31:02,480 --> 15:31:03,840
There's a Psylocke...

18002
15:31:03,840 --> 15:31:05,060
Oh, no, Starlord behind us.

18003
15:31:05,220 --> 15:31:05,640
Oh, I'm dead.

18004
15:31:08,260 --> 15:31:08,980
I froze...

18005
15:31:09,880 --> 15:31:10,240
Fiend.

18006
15:31:12,160 --> 15:31:12,880
There's a...

18007
15:31:12,880 --> 15:31:13,180
Manny!

18008
15:31:14,360 --> 15:31:15,680
There's a Starlord behind us.

18009
15:31:18,660 --> 15:31:20,260
Can you put me in the smoke later, Ducky?

18010
15:31:21,140 --> 15:31:22,400
Yeah, I got you, I got you.

18011
15:31:23,720 --> 15:31:24,160
Thank you.

18012
15:31:24,820 --> 15:31:25,760
I'm gonna get top ward.

18013
15:31:29,080 --> 15:31:31,080
Alright, here we go!

18014
15:31:34,380 --> 15:31:35,320
Look in now, look in now.

18015
15:31:35,560 --> 15:31:37,300
Mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag!

18016
15:31:38,640 --> 15:31:39,000
Nice.

18017
15:31:40,260 --> 15:31:41,300
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

18018
15:31:46,120 --> 15:31:48,140
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

18019
15:31:48,980 --> 15:31:49,340
Oh...

18020
15:31:50,000 --> 15:31:50,360
Oh...

18021
15:31:51,480 --> 15:31:52,600
I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

18022
15:31:53,600 --> 15:31:54,560
I'm very low.

18023
15:31:56,440 --> 15:31:58,740
When I say so, we should push up.

18024
15:31:59,680 --> 15:32:00,980
I'm low though, I'm really low.

18025
15:32:03,700 --> 15:32:05,580
That was a great vision, I love it.

18026
15:32:06,720 --> 15:32:08,460
Oh my god, we did it.

18027
15:32:13,600 --> 15:32:16,820
Guys, we're gonna... we're gonna break this purgatory.

18028
15:32:22,360 --> 15:32:24,460
I'll try and do an ult there, Starlord ult.

18029
15:32:25,900 --> 15:32:26,680
Mercy, Mercy, Mercy!

18030
15:32:26,800 --> 15:32:27,800
I'm tanking, I'm tanking, I'm tanking.

18031
15:32:29,780 --> 15:32:31,320
My shield is broke, I'm gonna die.

18032
15:32:32,200 --> 15:32:33,500
Alright, here we go.

18033
15:32:35,200 --> 15:32:37,180
We have a dam, we have a dam, we have a dam, we have a dam, we have a dam, we have a dam.

18034
15:32:39,140 --> 15:32:45,380
So... 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

18035
15:32:46,260 --> 15:32:46,740
I froze.

18036
15:32:50,240 --> 15:32:50,880
He's down on point.

18037
15:32:53,460 --> 15:32:57,320
I... I don't know what Adam's vision was.

18038
15:33:01,020 --> 15:33:06,620
The Adam's vision was... I don't know what he was thinking.

18039
15:33:10,670 --> 15:33:14,720
That was... that was very ambitious, that's for sure.

18040
15:33:21,400 --> 15:33:21,960
I froze.

18041
15:33:22,440 --> 15:33:23,120
I froze Train.

18042
15:33:23,900 --> 15:33:25,220
I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you.

18043
15:33:26,280 --> 15:33:27,140
We got it, thanks.

18044
15:33:31,320 --> 15:33:33,100
I need a load, I need a load.

18045
15:33:34,020 --> 15:33:35,200
There's... I have two people on me!

18046
15:33:40,240 --> 15:33:41,740
Oh no, this is last fight.

18047
15:33:43,640 --> 15:33:45,520
Let's go, we'll win, we... me and you, me and you.

18048
15:33:45,920 --> 15:33:46,200
Okay.

18049
15:33:46,600 --> 15:33:47,600
Oh, come, come, come.

18050
15:33:47,640 --> 15:33:48,240
No point, no point.

18051
15:33:48,640 --> 15:33:49,060
Oh, come on.

18052
15:33:49,280 --> 15:33:49,800
Oh, nice.

18053
15:33:51,480 --> 15:33:52,340
I'm ulting bot.

18054
15:33:54,660 --> 15:33:57,800
Point, point, point, point, point, point.

18055
15:33:59,420 --> 15:34:04,000
No more still hides.

18056
15:34:04,200 --> 15:34:05,120
No more and Starlord.

18057
15:34:08,580 --> 15:34:09,560
One more, one, one.

18058
15:34:09,700 --> 15:34:10,260
That's fine, that's fine.

18059
15:34:12,560 --> 15:34:14,700
Oh, he did not need a cocoon.

18060
15:34:15,300 --> 15:34:17,920
He... what a waste of a cocoon.

18061
15:34:17,920 --> 15:34:20,200
I'll take... I'll take that one.

18062
15:34:22,380 --> 15:34:24,320
I don't know why he cocooned there.

18063
15:34:24,420 --> 15:34:26,320
I should have been like, no cocoon!

18064
15:34:26,940 --> 15:34:28,180
I should have yelled that at him.

18065
15:34:29,540 --> 15:34:30,340
I can ult them, maybe.

18066
15:34:31,000 --> 15:34:31,940
Yeah, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

18067
15:34:33,680 --> 15:34:35,040
I hit him, I hit him.

18068
15:34:35,120 --> 15:34:35,600
He's good, he's good, he's good.

18069
15:34:36,880 --> 15:34:37,940
Oh, our mantis.

18070
15:34:38,660 --> 15:34:39,340
Oh, we have to proc.

18071
15:34:45,100 --> 15:34:46,000
He's got beam, Starlord.

18072
15:34:47,920 --> 15:34:49,080
Oh my god.

18073
15:34:49,720 --> 15:34:50,240
Yeah.

18074
15:34:51,000 --> 15:34:52,020
It's kinda bad.

18075
15:34:52,180 --> 15:34:52,880
Okay, let's push this one.

18076
15:34:54,200 --> 15:34:55,200
Yeah, R.

18077
15:34:59,340 --> 15:35:00,380
I trolled.

18078
15:35:03,690 --> 15:35:05,910
Okay, I think we... this is not working.

18079
15:35:06,090 --> 15:35:06,930
We switch up the comp.

18080
15:35:09,770 --> 15:35:10,850
What did we swap off?

18081
15:35:12,250 --> 15:35:12,490
What?

18082
15:35:13,330 --> 15:35:15,110
We have three support players.

18083
15:35:16,290 --> 15:35:20,650
We have three support players, but...

18084
15:35:20,650 --> 15:35:21,330
Also, I...

18085
15:35:21,330 --> 15:35:23,350
Why did Arad have to use his cocoon there?

18086
15:35:23,570 --> 15:35:25,550
Like, I'm like, we won the fight.

18087
15:35:27,710 --> 15:35:35,210
Yeah, three support works, but like...

18088
15:35:36,250 --> 15:35:38,790
Yeah, but just...

18089
15:35:38,790 --> 15:35:39,210
Yeah.

18090
15:35:40,590 --> 15:35:42,050
We need to play more together.

18091
15:35:42,910 --> 15:35:44,650
I feel like...

18092
15:35:44,650 --> 15:35:45,650
I feel like it's hard to...

18093
15:35:49,170 --> 15:35:49,650
Okay.

18094
15:35:50,810 --> 15:35:51,590
It'll be fine.

18095
15:35:53,250 --> 15:35:54,830
Guys, I believe in us.

18096
15:35:55,010 --> 15:35:55,710
Oh, thank god.

18097
15:35:56,910 --> 15:35:58,290
Oh, thank god he swapped off Adam.

18098
15:35:58,470 --> 15:36:00,470
I just... I don't think Adam is his character.

18099
15:36:01,030 --> 15:36:03,730
As a certified Adam player...

18100
15:36:05,010 --> 15:36:09,050
With a very positive win rate on Adam, I could tell that...

18101
15:36:09,050 --> 15:36:09,810
He was just not...

18102
15:36:10,310 --> 15:36:11,750
He was just not an Adam player.

18103
15:36:14,730 --> 15:36:15,130
Just...

18104
15:36:15,910 --> 15:36:19,170
You know, he could have done some things differently, you know, guys?

18105
15:36:22,250 --> 15:36:23,050
I'm on,

18106
15:36:26,070 --> 15:36:26,910
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on!

18107
15:36:26,990 --> 15:36:28,410
Oh, he...

18108
15:36:28,410 --> 15:36:29,290
That's unfortunate.

18109
15:36:30,730 --> 15:36:30,950
I have...

18110
15:36:31,590 --> 15:36:32,630
I have no more on me.

18111
15:36:32,630 --> 15:36:33,250
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on.

18112
15:36:33,770 --> 15:36:34,170
Oh!

18113
15:36:40,330 --> 15:36:41,730
I couldn't do anything!

18114
15:36:41,750 --> 15:36:42,570
I couldn't do anything!

18115
15:36:44,910 --> 15:36:46,910
No more fuck me up!

18116
15:36:47,010 --> 15:36:47,930
I pressed Q!

18117
15:36:49,610 --> 15:36:51,270
I pressed Q!

18118
15:36:56,600 --> 15:36:58,380
I can't believe it.

18119
15:37:06,490 --> 15:37:07,210
I'm coming over.

18120
15:37:07,850 --> 15:37:08,670
I'm coming over.

18121
15:37:15,330 --> 15:37:16,850
I'm coming over.

18122
15:37:16,910 --> 15:37:17,310
Oh, goodbye.

18123
15:37:18,430 --> 15:37:19,110
Goodbye.

18124
15:37:23,800 --> 15:37:25,940
Alright, next fight I go in.

18125
15:37:29,140 --> 15:37:29,820
Alright.

18126
15:37:30,760 --> 15:37:32,220
It's just very unfortunate.

18127
15:37:33,140 --> 15:37:36,640
We just have a very, very unfortunate team right here.

18128
15:37:37,680 --> 15:37:38,920
Alright, this is it.

18129
15:37:39,710 --> 15:37:42,660
I go in with my ult and maybe we'll live?

18130
15:37:43,480 --> 15:37:44,800
Maybe we'll live?

18131
15:37:46,340 --> 15:37:47,380
Right, guys?

18132
15:37:50,160 --> 15:37:51,920
We'll live, I believe.

18133
15:37:52,220 --> 15:37:53,360
I think we can live.

18134
15:37:55,020 --> 15:37:57,860
Nice, let's go.

18135
15:37:58,520 --> 15:38:00,100
There's a Starlord behind us.

18136
15:38:03,120 --> 15:38:04,220
Starlord has ult.

18137
15:38:05,640 --> 15:38:06,300
He's right behind us.

18138
15:38:06,340 --> 15:38:07,060
He's looking for it.

18139
15:38:10,060 --> 15:38:10,800
He's going for it.

18140
15:38:10,940 --> 15:38:11,640
He can come for it.

18141
15:38:11,740 --> 15:38:12,440
Oh my god.

18142
15:38:15,720 --> 15:38:16,640
Jesus Christ.

18143
15:38:20,560 --> 15:38:23,120
I'm a little worried about the Starlord ult.

18144
15:38:23,960 --> 15:38:24,600
Are we up top?

18145
15:38:28,020 --> 15:38:28,720
I'm on him.

18146
15:38:28,840 --> 15:38:29,440
I'm aiming him.

18147
15:38:29,980 --> 15:38:30,280
He's up.

18148
15:38:30,960 --> 15:38:32,360
I think we should stop chasing.

18149
15:38:34,420 --> 15:38:37,980
A little bit.

18150
15:38:38,140 --> 15:38:39,100
Just a little bit.

18151
15:38:39,260 --> 15:38:40,640
Thank you.

18152
15:38:42,760 --> 15:38:45,820
I hear Starlord above us.

18153
15:38:46,080 --> 15:38:47,560
There it is.

18154
15:38:51,160 --> 15:38:55,320
Yeah, they did.

18155
15:38:55,900 --> 15:38:56,860
Thank you.

18156
15:39:00,460 --> 15:39:01,960
Oh my god.

18157
15:39:02,040 --> 15:39:02,800
Oh my god.

18158
15:39:02,860 --> 15:39:03,960
Is he gonna live?

18159
15:39:04,940 --> 15:39:05,600
Oh, he's not.

18160
15:39:05,700 --> 15:39:06,960
I saw a whole fucking army.

18161
15:39:07,680 --> 15:39:08,780
Oh my god.

18162
15:39:08,840 --> 15:39:10,560
That was a whole army right there.

18163
15:39:11,800 --> 15:39:14,060
No, he's letting me.

18164
15:39:27,550 --> 15:39:28,890
Starlord on the right.

18165
15:39:30,270 --> 15:39:31,690
Oh, he pushed me.

18166
15:39:32,170 --> 15:39:32,790
That's so bad.

18167
15:39:36,710 --> 15:39:37,630
Okay.

18168
15:39:38,470 --> 15:39:39,590
That's cool.

18169
15:39:40,390 --> 15:39:40,990
Okay.

18170
15:39:46,330 --> 15:39:47,550
Guys, it's just...

18171
15:39:48,430 --> 15:39:50,430
It's just that wasn't the game.

18172
15:39:50,710 --> 15:39:52,250
I'm the champion!

18173
15:39:52,250 --> 15:39:52,530
I'm the champion!

18174
15:39:55,310 --> 15:39:58,170
Oh my god.

18175
15:39:58,530 --> 15:40:00,720
No, don't say that, guys.

18176
15:40:01,350 --> 15:40:02,690
He has...

18177
15:40:02,690 --> 15:40:04,660
Guys, don't say that.

18178
15:40:05,270 --> 15:40:10,410
He won the tournament, guys.

18179
15:40:12,990 --> 15:40:14,010
Guys!

18180
15:40:16,880 --> 15:40:19,190
It's not Doom queuing.

18181
15:40:19,750 --> 15:40:22,230
It's not Doom queuing.

18182
15:40:22,250 --> 15:40:23,230
It's not Doom queuing.

18183
15:40:25,350 --> 15:40:27,410
Not my tournament.

18184
15:40:29,830 --> 15:40:31,010
Oh my god.

18185
15:40:31,530 --> 15:40:32,470
Okay, we're gonna settle.

18186
15:40:33,230 --> 15:40:34,190
We're gonna settle.

18187
15:40:34,330 --> 15:40:35,790
I'm settling at 100.

18188
15:40:37,370 --> 15:40:39,250
I'm gonna settle at 100.

18189
15:40:39,590 --> 15:40:42,730
I just need one more win and then we'll be fine.

18190
15:40:45,960 --> 15:40:47,440
It was a gold tournament?

18191
15:40:47,760 --> 15:40:49,880
It's like the full tournament, isn't it?

18192
15:40:50,180 --> 15:40:51,880
Isn't that the tournament that we had?

18193
15:40:54,620 --> 15:40:57,780
That's been going on for like two weeks now?

18194
15:40:57,960 --> 15:40:58,920
Wasn't that the tournament?

18195
15:40:59,960 --> 15:41:01,240
We just need one win.

18196
15:41:01,420 --> 15:41:02,700
We literally just need one.

18197
15:41:02,960 --> 15:41:04,240
I'm settling at...

18198
15:41:04,240 --> 15:41:06,080
I'm not settling at 80.

18199
15:41:06,440 --> 15:41:08,770
I refuse to settle...

18200
15:41:12,290 --> 15:41:14,460
I refuse to settle at 80.

18201
15:41:17,040 --> 15:41:18,440
I'm settling...

18202
15:41:18,440 --> 15:41:20,540
I'm settling at 100.

18203
15:41:20,720 --> 15:41:22,680
I just need one win.

18204
15:41:22,680 --> 15:41:24,960
And then I'll be happy.

18205
15:41:25,540 --> 15:41:29,700
And then I'll do it all over again!

18206
15:41:33,420 --> 15:41:34,420
Tonight!

18207
15:41:35,420 --> 15:41:36,220
Yippee!

18208
15:41:41,520 --> 15:41:44,380
Helios is like...

18209
15:41:44,380 --> 15:41:46,600
Helios is like, oh man.

18210
15:41:48,040 --> 15:41:49,240
It's over.

18211
15:41:50,080 --> 15:41:52,000
Just one more win.

18212
15:41:52,000 --> 15:41:53,480
I should have settled at 30.

18213
15:41:53,620 --> 15:41:54,280
Why did I...

18214
15:41:54,280 --> 15:41:55,880
I should have settled at 130.

18215
15:41:56,080 --> 15:41:58,400
Why did I ever convince me to go again?

18216
15:41:58,840 --> 15:42:01,140
I'm just so fucking...

18217
15:42:01,140 --> 15:42:02,100
Oh my god.

18218
15:42:02,160 --> 15:42:04,380
I'm so easily manipulable.

18219
15:42:06,920 --> 15:42:10,180
We could have stopped at 130.

18220
15:42:10,440 --> 15:42:12,780
I'm just so easily convinced.

18221
15:42:15,260 --> 15:42:16,460
I'm so...

18222
15:42:17,460 --> 15:42:18,920
Oh my god.

18223
15:42:21,300 --> 15:42:22,080
Oh my god.

18224
15:42:22,080 --> 15:42:22,720
I never learn.

18225
15:42:23,040 --> 15:42:24,460
I just never learn.

18226
15:42:24,620 --> 15:42:28,260
Guys, I never fucking learn.

18227
15:42:32,650 --> 15:42:34,530
How do we have another person?

18228
15:42:34,930 --> 15:42:37,070
How do we keep getting more people?

18229
15:42:38,470 --> 15:42:39,930
What's this guy?

18230
15:42:40,690 --> 15:42:41,810
Who is he?

18231
15:42:42,530 --> 15:42:44,710
How do we adopt a third...

18232
15:42:44,710 --> 15:42:45,230
Ow.

18233
15:42:48,390 --> 15:42:50,670
When did this person show up?

18234
15:42:53,670 --> 15:42:54,610
Stop that.

18235
15:42:56,430 --> 15:42:58,210
Wait, he's winning.

18236
15:43:02,410 --> 15:43:03,950
Oh my god.

18237
15:43:06,170 --> 15:43:09,490
How did this third person showed up?

18238
15:43:09,810 --> 15:43:11,290
I'm so confused.

18239
15:43:12,010 --> 15:43:13,330
Where did he come from?

18240
15:43:14,010 --> 15:43:17,170
I miss Rosa.

18241
15:43:17,170 --> 15:43:17,670
I...

18242
15:43:17,670 --> 15:43:23,630
I don't know how they keep showing up.

18243
15:43:25,990 --> 15:43:27,490
I'm gonna break his streak.

18244
15:43:28,190 --> 15:43:29,990
Just like how I broke Ulysses' streak.

18245
15:43:30,850 --> 15:43:32,590
No longer chops.

18246
15:43:32,950 --> 15:43:34,030
No longer...

18247
15:43:34,030 --> 15:43:36,750
But like, not intentionally though.

18248
15:43:37,350 --> 15:43:39,070
It was not intentionally.

18249
15:43:41,790 --> 15:43:43,390
Herder into the madness.

18250
15:43:44,750 --> 15:43:46,230
I'm most likely there today.

18251
15:43:46,230 --> 15:43:47,990
I'm gonna play off stream later today.

18252
15:43:48,110 --> 15:43:50,110
I don't think I can do another long stream.

18253
15:43:51,130 --> 15:43:51,610
Today.

18254
15:43:53,370 --> 15:43:54,330
I don't...

18255
15:43:54,330 --> 15:43:57,450
Guys, do not camp out on my stream for today.

18256
15:44:02,870 --> 15:44:04,150
I'm gonna go sleep.

18257
15:44:04,230 --> 15:44:06,630
And then we're gonna do it all over again.

18258
15:44:08,770 --> 15:44:10,750
But like, I'm gonna do it off stream.

18259
15:44:13,370 --> 15:44:14,890
I'm gonna do it off stream.

18260
15:44:16,110 --> 15:44:17,330
What's the point?

18261
15:44:17,330 --> 15:44:19,270
I don't know.

18262
15:44:19,410 --> 15:44:24,130
I can't keep up with the manic energy on the nut again later.

18263
15:44:24,930 --> 15:44:26,890
I'm on my third win.

18264
15:44:27,470 --> 15:44:29,330
And can't keep doing this.

18265
15:44:31,670 --> 15:44:32,850
What's the point?

18266
15:44:34,430 --> 15:44:36,070
Think of the ad revenue.

18267
15:44:36,450 --> 15:44:39,050
Thanks for reminding me to have some ads.

18268
15:44:39,350 --> 15:44:40,690
Here, I have a 30 second ad.

18269
15:44:45,050 --> 15:44:46,370
Here's a 30 second ad.

18270
15:44:47,910 --> 15:44:50,270
Think of the ad revenue.

18271
15:44:54,190 --> 15:44:55,390
Real shit.

18272
15:44:57,010 --> 15:44:59,230
Thank you, I needed the reminder.

18273
15:45:00,930 --> 15:45:03,430
I can't wait to do this all over again.

18274
15:45:03,570 --> 15:45:04,710
But like, off stream.

18275
15:45:05,870 --> 15:45:06,770
Oh my god.

18276
15:45:07,070 --> 15:45:10,390
I feel like people watching me are watching me for like...

18277
15:45:10,390 --> 15:45:12,450
The descent into madness.

18278
15:45:14,010 --> 15:45:18,130
They're watching my descent into fucking madness here.

18279
15:45:21,690 --> 15:45:24,510
I cannot stream a nut.

18280
15:45:24,770 --> 15:45:25,930
I can't, guys.

18281
15:45:26,770 --> 15:45:27,390
I cannot.

18282
15:45:27,910 --> 15:45:29,850
I cannot, guys.

18283
15:45:49,250 --> 15:45:51,730
Guys, I'm literally settling.

18284
15:45:53,230 --> 15:45:54,150
Alright,

18285
15:46:01,020 --> 15:46:01,540
here we go.

18286
15:46:01,540 --> 15:46:02,720
I'm gonna lock in.

18287
15:46:02,820 --> 15:46:04,000
If we win this, we're free.

18288
15:46:05,080 --> 15:46:06,500
I should've fucking...

18289
15:46:06,500 --> 15:46:08,060
Guys, I don't know what was wrong with me.

18290
15:46:08,140 --> 15:46:09,760
Why did I not stop at 130?

18291
15:46:10,080 --> 15:46:12,280
Why did I let him convince me?

18292
15:46:13,000 --> 15:46:13,480
I...

18293
15:46:17,940 --> 15:46:18,900
I'm gonna...

18294
15:46:18,900 --> 15:46:21,120
I'm gonna lock in so hard.

18295
15:46:21,760 --> 15:46:22,640
Why, guys?

18296
15:46:22,780 --> 15:46:25,080
Why did you not stop me?

18297
15:46:25,960 --> 15:46:28,440
Why did you not stop me?

18298
15:46:31,760 --> 15:46:32,520
Why?

18299
15:46:32,520 --> 15:46:33,080
That's fine.

18300
15:46:34,020 --> 15:46:35,460
We tried.

18301
15:46:36,540 --> 15:46:38,420
No, I don't think I remember that.

18302
15:46:39,300 --> 15:46:41,060
I don't think I remember that.

18303
15:46:44,880 --> 15:46:47,240
We could've stopped at a nice 130.

18304
15:46:48,600 --> 15:46:49,640
Right there.

18305
15:46:52,400 --> 15:46:54,460
It's because you're a motherfucker.

18306
15:46:55,260 --> 15:46:57,240
Wait, did we have Mantis Ban?

18307
15:46:57,240 --> 15:46:57,980
Oh, we did.

18308
15:46:58,100 --> 15:46:59,680
Okay, I was gonna say...

18309
15:46:59,680 --> 15:47:00,780
Like, what's wrong with us?

18310
15:47:07,340 --> 15:47:08,540
We'll be fine.

18311
15:47:08,780 --> 15:47:10,720
We'll do this all over again.

18312
15:47:10,960 --> 15:47:11,460
One win.

18313
15:47:15,180 --> 15:47:16,300
One win.

18314
15:47:16,380 --> 15:47:16,400
One win.

18315
15:47:16,400 --> 15:47:17,180
Let's bring it home.

18316
15:47:18,680 --> 15:47:19,620
One win.

18317
15:47:19,860 --> 15:47:21,520
Booger's like, free me.

18318
15:47:25,480 --> 15:47:27,240
Booger, you did this.

18319
15:47:27,520 --> 15:47:30,840
We could've ended this so long ago.

18320
15:47:31,400 --> 15:47:32,680
I'm pushing the cart.

18321
15:47:33,040 --> 15:47:33,880
Break walls, break walls.

18322
15:47:34,900 --> 15:47:35,940
I'm walled off, I'm walled off.

18323
15:47:36,480 --> 15:47:36,920
Shit, shit, shit.

18324
15:47:37,220 --> 15:47:37,820
I'm shooting the walls.

18325
15:47:43,380 --> 15:47:43,980
Magnia's half.

18326
15:47:44,240 --> 15:47:45,080
Mike half, Mike half.

18327
15:47:47,680 --> 15:47:48,140
He has no...

18328
15:47:48,140 --> 15:47:48,700
He has no...

18329
15:47:50,080 --> 15:47:51,160
You're walled off, you're walled off.

18330
15:47:51,340 --> 15:47:51,680
You're walled off.

18331
15:47:51,700 --> 15:47:52,180
One win.

18332
15:47:53,440 --> 15:47:54,600
You're walled off right now.

18333
15:47:55,100 --> 15:47:56,260
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.

18334
15:48:00,310 --> 15:48:00,910
Bye, guys.

18335
15:48:02,590 --> 15:48:03,730
I know what ult we have.

18336
15:48:03,890 --> 15:48:04,990
Just send it.

18337
15:48:07,050 --> 15:48:08,590
I froze him, I froze him.

18338
15:48:09,070 --> 15:48:10,370
Don't do anything to him.

18339
15:48:11,070 --> 15:48:11,450
No!

18340
15:48:12,850 --> 15:48:13,690
We need to win this one.

18341
15:48:17,550 --> 15:48:19,610
Who woke him up?

18342
15:48:21,330 --> 15:48:23,950
Got him, got him.

18343
15:48:26,840 --> 15:48:28,300
I'm coming back.

18344
15:48:30,500 --> 15:48:32,300
There's a Groot on our support.

18345
15:48:32,760 --> 15:48:34,100
One win, one win, one win.

18346
15:48:35,360 --> 15:48:36,340
We'll be free.

18347
15:48:38,060 --> 15:48:38,940
Doki, one win.

18348
15:48:39,180 --> 15:48:39,980
We'll be free.

18349
15:48:41,460 --> 15:48:42,360
Doki, one win.

18350
15:48:42,540 --> 15:48:43,340
We could do it.

18351
15:48:43,440 --> 15:48:45,900
We could have stopped four games ago.

18352
15:48:47,080 --> 15:48:49,100
Listen, but we became better players.

18353
15:48:49,720 --> 15:48:51,780
Damn, I don't feel better.

18354
15:48:52,400 --> 15:48:54,320
We became better, we became better.

18355
15:48:55,300 --> 15:48:58,080
Heal us, rage, quit on us, what do you mean?

18356
15:49:01,920 --> 15:49:03,020
It's a one win though.

18357
15:49:08,910 --> 15:49:10,510
Oh my god, max one, max one.

18358
15:49:11,310 --> 15:49:12,370
One win, one win.

18359
15:49:12,530 --> 15:49:14,930
Doki, I want all of your energy right now.

18360
15:49:16,430 --> 15:49:17,370
I'm locked in.

18361
15:49:19,370 --> 15:49:23,250
I'm locked in with 180 ping, what do you want from me?

18362
15:49:23,350 --> 15:49:24,350
I want you, I want everyone.

18363
15:49:24,870 --> 15:49:25,910
Max, max energy.

18364
15:49:26,070 --> 15:49:26,670
One win.

18365
15:49:27,170 --> 15:49:28,810
You're locked, you're walled off, you're walled off.

18366
15:49:33,930 --> 15:49:35,510
I have my ult, watch this.

18367
15:49:35,990 --> 15:49:36,730
The one win.

18368
15:49:37,710 --> 15:49:38,170
Let's go.

18369
15:49:43,790 --> 15:49:45,810
Behind us, behind us, behind us, behind us, behind us.

18370
15:49:49,570 --> 15:49:51,250
Oh my god, I'm so low, please.

18371
15:49:52,990 --> 15:49:56,470
Please, I just needed a little heals.

18372
15:49:58,610 --> 15:49:59,530
Bruno's so low.

18373
15:49:59,750 --> 15:50:00,070
Oh, nevermind.

18374
15:50:00,570 --> 15:50:01,090
I know.

18375
15:50:01,910 --> 15:50:02,890
I think I inted.

18376
15:50:04,250 --> 15:50:05,070
I'm dodging in W.

18377
15:50:05,330 --> 15:50:06,210
I have TP, I have TP.

18378
15:50:07,130 --> 15:50:07,990
I'm coming back.

18379
15:50:09,170 --> 15:50:09,910
I have TP, I have TP.

18380
15:50:10,090 --> 15:50:11,050
We win this, we win this.

18381
15:50:11,330 --> 15:50:11,970
Yeah, we got them.

18382
15:50:12,510 --> 15:50:13,750
He missed, he missed, he missed, he missed.

18383
15:50:17,170 --> 15:50:17,430
Oh.

18384
15:50:19,950 --> 15:50:21,330
Wait, wait, they still ulted, they still ulted.

18385
15:50:21,330 --> 15:50:21,670
I have one ping, one ping.

18386
15:50:22,250 --> 15:50:22,690
They danced.

18387
15:50:22,850 --> 15:50:24,250
I'm TPing, I'm TPing, I'm TPing, I'm TPing.

18388
15:50:27,250 --> 15:50:27,830
I have to reload.

18389
15:50:29,450 --> 15:50:30,090
One win, one win.

18390
15:50:30,830 --> 15:50:31,830
Go in, go in, go in with this.

18391
15:50:32,370 --> 15:50:32,630
Oh.

18392
15:50:33,910 --> 15:50:34,490
One win, one win.

18393
15:50:34,710 --> 15:50:35,230
Go, go, go.

18394
15:50:36,210 --> 15:50:37,490
One win, one win.

18395
15:50:37,990 --> 15:50:38,650
One win, one win.

18396
15:50:41,110 --> 15:50:42,570
Go, go, go, go, go.

18397
15:50:42,570 --> 15:50:43,170
Go top.

18398
15:50:45,990 --> 15:50:46,750
One win.

18399
15:50:47,670 --> 15:50:49,270
Oh my god.

18400
15:50:50,430 --> 15:50:51,270
We're so...

18401
15:50:51,850 --> 15:50:53,090
We're doing it.

18402
15:50:55,770 --> 15:50:58,250
Oh, I'm pushing up.

18403
15:51:04,400 --> 15:51:05,240
Oh.

18404
15:51:06,300 --> 15:51:07,100
I...

18405
15:51:07,100 --> 15:51:09,900
I don't know what the plan was.

18406
15:51:13,640 --> 15:51:16,160
I can't even keep track of ults anymore.

18407
15:51:16,420 --> 15:51:19,100
Like, if something happened, it's just gonna happen.

18408
15:51:19,660 --> 15:51:20,260
Like...

18409
15:51:20,260 --> 15:51:21,360
Like...

18410
15:51:21,360 --> 15:51:22,440
Like...

18411
15:51:22,440 --> 15:51:24,200
I don't know.

18412
15:51:26,800 --> 15:51:28,620
If it happens, it happens.

18413
15:51:28,780 --> 15:51:30,960
I'm not even keeping track anymore.

18414
15:51:33,940 --> 15:51:35,180
I'm ulting, I'm ulting this.

18415
15:51:35,180 --> 15:51:35,440
Yay.

18416
15:51:40,380 --> 15:51:41,900
I'm pushing up, I'm pushing up.

18417
15:51:42,740 --> 15:51:42,940
Oh.

18418
15:51:44,480 --> 15:51:45,800
I'm pushing up, pushing up.

18419
15:51:54,800 --> 15:51:55,780
Oh my god.

18420
15:51:57,660 --> 15:51:58,580
Oh my god.

18421
15:51:59,180 --> 15:52:00,960
I'm backing up a little.

18422
15:52:09,400 --> 15:52:10,740
Oh, I...

18423
15:52:11,260 --> 15:52:12,900
I don't know if we lived this.

18424
15:52:13,940 --> 15:52:14,800
Wait, did Luna ulted?

18425
15:52:20,590 --> 15:52:21,750
Oh my god.

18426
15:52:23,470 --> 15:52:23,910
They...

18427
15:52:23,910 --> 15:52:25,910
Luna ulted, so...

18428
15:52:25,910 --> 15:52:27,070
They don't have any split ults.

18429
15:52:27,350 --> 15:52:27,990
They just ulted.

18430
15:52:28,030 --> 15:52:28,150
Listen.

18431
15:52:28,330 --> 15:52:29,250
We get the lamp.

18432
15:52:29,390 --> 15:52:30,210
We get the lamp out.

18433
15:52:30,730 --> 15:52:32,230
Then Rek'Sai Nation does the rest.

18434
15:52:34,330 --> 15:52:35,230
I'm pushing this root.

18435
15:52:36,810 --> 15:52:37,410
Pray the wolves.

18436
15:52:38,330 --> 15:52:39,170
Pray the wolves.

18437
15:52:39,310 --> 15:52:39,730
Use everything.

18438
15:52:40,610 --> 15:52:45,370
Yeah, I'm trying my best, but...

18439
15:52:45,370 --> 15:52:45,750
Oh.

18440
15:52:46,070 --> 15:52:46,790
Oh my god.

18441
15:52:47,050 --> 15:52:50,130
Oh, yeah, you were taking a lot of damage.

18442
15:52:50,150 --> 15:52:51,390
We don't go there.

18443
15:52:51,550 --> 15:52:51,630
We don't go there.

18444
15:52:51,630 --> 15:52:51,890
We don't go there.

18445
15:52:52,050 --> 15:52:52,370
Go main.

18446
15:52:52,450 --> 15:52:52,630
Go main.

18447
15:52:52,730 --> 15:52:53,610
Go main.

18448
15:52:53,750 --> 15:52:54,010
We go main.

18449
15:52:54,630 --> 15:52:55,230
I won't group up.

18450
15:52:55,610 --> 15:52:55,950
We go main.

18451
15:52:56,410 --> 15:52:56,790
We go main.

18452
15:52:57,010 --> 15:52:57,310
Alright.

18453
15:53:06,120 --> 15:53:07,020
Walled off again.

18454
15:53:07,580 --> 15:53:07,880
Push this.

18455
15:53:07,940 --> 15:53:08,240
Push this.

18456
15:53:10,160 --> 15:53:10,800
Help him.

18457
15:53:10,880 --> 15:53:11,020
Help him.

18458
15:53:11,160 --> 15:53:11,300
Help him.

18459
15:53:13,000 --> 15:53:13,740
Push the back lane.

18460
15:53:14,360 --> 15:53:14,800
Magneo's half.

18461
15:53:14,940 --> 15:53:15,420
Magneo's low.

18462
15:53:16,340 --> 15:53:17,480
Oh my god.

18463
15:53:17,640 --> 15:53:17,960
No.

18464
15:53:19,020 --> 15:53:19,340
No!

18465
15:53:20,060 --> 15:53:20,680
I'm down.

18466
15:53:20,680 --> 15:53:22,080
It's fine.

18467
15:53:23,420 --> 15:53:26,090
I got Magneo ulted.

18468
15:53:27,490 --> 15:53:28,740
They have another?

18469
15:53:29,680 --> 15:53:31,460
Oh my god.

18470
15:53:31,620 --> 15:53:31,980
Fear.

18471
15:53:32,720 --> 15:53:33,240
Fear.

18472
15:53:34,600 --> 15:53:36,040
Actual fear.

18473
15:53:37,500 --> 15:53:38,660
He's low.

18474
15:53:38,860 --> 15:53:39,260
He's one.

18475
15:53:39,980 --> 15:53:40,360
He's one.

18476
15:53:40,760 --> 15:53:41,100
He's one.

18477
15:53:47,760 --> 15:53:50,430
I'm healing as much as I can.

18478
15:53:50,830 --> 15:53:52,210
I don't care.

18479
15:53:55,410 --> 15:53:55,850
Alright.

18480
15:53:56,730 --> 15:53:57,130
Alright.

18481
15:53:58,050 --> 15:53:59,330
I'm moving up.

18482
15:54:00,030 --> 15:54:01,350
Can we get the turret?

18483
15:54:01,650 --> 15:54:02,570
But that's alright.

18484
15:54:02,790 --> 15:54:03,810
I guess we don't care.

18485
15:54:05,410 --> 15:54:06,150
I froze somebody.

18486
15:54:06,350 --> 15:54:07,410
I have a Magneo on me.

18487
15:54:07,590 --> 15:54:08,030
I need help.

18488
15:54:10,010 --> 15:54:10,930
Magneo's still on me.

18489
15:54:20,120 --> 15:54:21,060
Oh my god.

18490
15:54:22,580 --> 15:54:23,500
Come on, come on, come on.

18491
15:54:27,640 --> 15:54:28,840
I'm pushing the cart a little bit.

18492
15:54:31,480 --> 15:54:33,240
I don't know if I can save it.

18493
15:54:34,360 --> 15:54:35,180
You can, you can.

18494
15:54:35,920 --> 15:54:36,820
We need to play slow here.

18495
15:54:37,020 --> 15:54:37,740
We must have ults.

18496
15:54:37,860 --> 15:54:38,360
Magneo ult.

18497
15:54:38,740 --> 15:54:39,020
Oh.

18498
15:54:42,820 --> 15:54:43,140
Top.

18499
15:54:48,150 --> 15:54:49,070
Walled off for me.

18500
15:54:52,190 --> 15:54:53,070
We win this Rixi.

18501
15:54:53,070 --> 15:54:53,510
You and me, buddy.

18502
15:54:54,530 --> 15:54:55,210
We need to kill the backline.

18503
15:54:59,680 --> 15:55:00,620
Trying to get you.

18504
15:55:01,500 --> 15:55:02,260
We need to play for W.

18505
15:55:03,520 --> 15:55:04,980
I don't know if I can get it now.

18506
15:55:08,180 --> 15:55:09,960
I can't.

18507
15:55:10,340 --> 15:55:10,380
Oh.

18508
15:55:13,180 --> 15:55:16,300
I was 5% off.

18509
15:55:23,010 --> 15:55:24,090
Oh.

18510
15:55:30,160 --> 15:55:31,420
Oh my god.

18511
15:55:32,300 --> 15:55:33,700
I was 5% off from that.

18512
15:55:37,100 --> 15:55:38,820
1 win.

18513
15:55:40,240 --> 15:55:42,300
1 win.

18514
15:55:44,560 --> 15:55:45,680
No, it wasn't the other Luna.

18515
15:55:45,860 --> 15:55:46,680
It was their Loki.

18516
15:55:47,040 --> 15:55:48,560
Their Loki copied their Luna.

18517
15:55:53,740 --> 15:55:57,840
So it wasn't like the Luna just fucking got it all after one fight.

18518
15:55:59,200 --> 15:56:00,480
And then Rixi has a res.

18519
15:56:00,800 --> 15:56:01,940
And then it's really annoying for them.

18520
15:56:05,120 --> 15:56:05,980
If you can play Adam.

18521
15:56:08,300 --> 15:56:09,100
Oh my god.

18522
15:56:11,620 --> 15:56:12,060
Oh.

18523
15:56:12,600 --> 15:56:13,860
I can play Adam.

18524
15:56:14,160 --> 15:56:14,640
You play Luna?

18525
15:56:14,860 --> 15:56:15,600
No, no, no, no.

18526
15:56:15,600 --> 15:56:16,120
You stay Luna.

18527
15:56:16,120 --> 15:56:16,520
Okay.

18528
15:56:18,020 --> 15:56:19,540
No, no, no.

18529
15:56:19,620 --> 15:56:20,480
Adam is good.

18530
15:56:20,660 --> 15:56:21,760
He wants to play Luna.

18531
15:56:22,000 --> 15:56:22,880
And you go Adam.

18532
15:56:23,220 --> 15:56:23,420
Yeah.

18533
15:56:23,760 --> 15:56:24,640
But get the Luna.

18534
15:56:25,200 --> 15:56:27,900
You want to go duple support or something?

18535
15:56:28,380 --> 15:56:28,700
No, no, no.

18536
15:56:29,120 --> 15:56:29,640
Alright.

18537
15:56:29,700 --> 15:56:30,080
Okay.

18538
15:56:30,420 --> 15:56:30,600
Awesome.

18539
15:56:30,780 --> 15:56:31,780
Alright, here we go.

18540
15:56:33,460 --> 15:56:34,920
It's Adam time.

18541
15:56:36,320 --> 15:56:37,920
It's Adam time.

18542
15:56:38,180 --> 15:56:39,000
Let's go.

18543
15:56:40,780 --> 15:56:41,560
It's time.

18544
15:56:41,560 --> 15:56:41,600
Oh my god.

18545
15:56:44,020 --> 15:56:46,640
Doki said I can see my family again if you go somewhere.

18546
15:56:49,780 --> 15:56:52,300
I feel like I'm held hostage by you.

18547
15:56:52,380 --> 15:56:55,440
I was going to be done 4-5 days ago.

18548
15:56:55,660 --> 15:56:57,400
I was ready to call it.

18549
15:56:58,080 --> 15:56:58,300
Listen.

18550
15:56:58,680 --> 15:56:59,700
It goes both ways, okay?

18551
15:56:59,820 --> 15:57:00,300
What?

18552
15:57:02,100 --> 15:57:04,440
I was ready to call it.

18553
15:57:06,860 --> 15:57:07,340
Bubble.

18554
15:57:08,060 --> 15:57:09,040
I don't have shields.

18555
15:57:09,120 --> 15:57:09,440
I'm dead.

18556
15:57:09,440 --> 15:57:10,500
I'm like...

18557
15:57:10,880 --> 15:57:12,500
I have Q, though.

18558
15:57:13,280 --> 15:57:14,400
Run, run, run, run, run.

18559
15:57:20,500 --> 15:57:21,260
I'm just gonna ping.

18560
15:57:22,320 --> 15:57:22,760
I'm back.

18561
15:57:25,000 --> 15:57:25,660
You're so good.

18562
15:57:26,760 --> 15:57:27,560
The Magnias have.

18563
15:57:27,800 --> 15:57:29,240
I've returned, I've returned, I've returned.

18564
15:57:29,600 --> 15:57:30,480
I've returned, I've returned.

18565
15:57:30,620 --> 15:57:31,400
Very close, very close.

18566
15:57:34,300 --> 15:57:35,140
He's going for a hook.

18567
15:57:35,980 --> 15:57:36,260
No.

18568
15:57:38,440 --> 15:57:39,220
I'm playing right now.

18569
15:57:39,760 --> 15:57:40,500
The Magnia's low.

18570
15:57:41,420 --> 15:57:42,120
Oh, nevermind, nevermind.

18571
15:57:42,920 --> 15:57:46,040
He's going for a hook.

18572
15:57:48,080 --> 15:57:48,760
Magnias, yeah.

18573
15:57:49,380 --> 15:57:50,000
No lamp, no lamp.

18574
15:57:53,680 --> 15:57:54,440
Very low, very low.

18575
15:57:56,020 --> 15:57:56,580
I have my...

18576
15:58:07,650 --> 15:58:08,850
I have the Soba on this.

18577
15:58:09,810 --> 15:58:10,370
Magnia one.

18578
15:58:10,690 --> 15:58:11,630
Mag, Mag, one, Mag, one, Mag, one.

18579
15:58:12,790 --> 15:58:13,650
Chilling, chilling, chilling.

18580
15:58:14,170 --> 15:58:14,830
Watch out, Groot, too.

18581
15:58:18,210 --> 15:58:18,990
Keep me alive, keep me alive.

18582
15:58:19,470 --> 15:58:19,930
I'm ulting.

18583
15:58:22,010 --> 15:58:23,010
Come to me, I can hook.

18584
15:58:23,270 --> 15:58:24,470
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

18585
15:58:24,610 --> 15:58:25,630
I got them all, I got them all.

18586
15:58:25,650 --> 15:58:25,910
What?

18587
15:58:29,450 --> 15:58:30,290
That's fine, that's fine.

18588
15:58:30,390 --> 15:58:31,070
One on this.

18589
15:58:31,670 --> 15:58:32,350
Mag, Mag, Mag, one.

18590
15:58:32,750 --> 15:58:33,630
Mag, one, Mag, one.

18591
15:58:33,790 --> 15:58:34,010
Nice.

18592
15:58:34,870 --> 15:58:35,230
Come on!

18593
15:58:35,530 --> 15:58:36,090
I'm on Sylar.

18594
15:58:37,010 --> 15:58:37,470
One wave.

18595
15:58:37,750 --> 15:58:37,990
What?

18596
15:58:42,350 --> 15:58:43,670
I missed my family.

18597
15:58:43,770 --> 15:58:44,170
That's fine.

18598
15:58:44,530 --> 15:58:45,370
I missed my wife.

18599
15:58:45,630 --> 15:58:46,350
I missed my kids.

18600
15:58:46,350 --> 15:58:46,690
What?

18601
15:58:47,450 --> 15:58:49,910
How the fuck did he get me there?

18602
15:58:50,090 --> 15:58:50,550
One wave.

18603
15:58:50,550 --> 15:58:51,290
One wave.

18604
15:58:51,350 --> 15:58:52,990
I haven't eaten at all today.

18605
15:58:54,950 --> 15:58:57,630
This could have ended four games ago.

18606
15:59:00,110 --> 15:59:03,930
But we wouldn't have built this beautiful story of one wave.

18607
15:59:06,910 --> 15:59:08,390
Oh my fucking god, bro.

18608
15:59:09,790 --> 15:59:11,010
I'm still botting us.

18609
15:59:11,250 --> 15:59:11,910
I got hooked.

18610
15:59:12,290 --> 15:59:12,750
I got hooked.

18611
15:59:13,130 --> 15:59:13,790
Nice, nice.

18612
15:59:13,930 --> 15:59:14,930
Nice kill, nice kill.

18613
15:59:17,330 --> 15:59:18,110
Break wall, break wall.

18614
15:59:18,450 --> 15:59:18,750
Live, chill.

18615
15:59:19,050 --> 15:59:19,710
Live, live, live.

18616
15:59:19,710 --> 15:59:20,890
We almost have winnable.

18617
15:59:20,970 --> 15:59:21,890
We almost have winnable.

18618
15:59:22,150 --> 15:59:22,950
Play for winnable.

18619
15:59:26,290 --> 15:59:29,150
I literally just got fucked up.

18620
15:59:30,930 --> 15:59:32,650
You just keep going.

18621
15:59:33,110 --> 15:59:33,710
Okay, we can't do it.

18622
15:59:44,490 --> 15:59:48,630
I need to play up.

18623
15:59:49,750 --> 15:59:50,910
I need to push up here.

18624
15:59:51,050 --> 15:59:51,870
Fuck, he's low.

18625
15:59:57,490 --> 15:59:58,510
That was strange.

18626
16:00:07,630 --> 16:00:08,550
Can we push?

18627
16:00:08,750 --> 16:00:09,170
I'm pushing up.

18628
16:00:09,330 --> 16:00:10,410
Yeah, we're pushing up now.

18629
16:00:13,730 --> 16:00:14,510
Big one, big one.

18630
16:00:14,510 --> 16:00:16,510
I am at your service.

18631
16:00:18,950 --> 16:00:20,910
I am ready to put on a show.

18632
16:00:21,930 --> 16:00:23,410
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

18633
16:00:30,320 --> 16:00:31,220
I'm trying to.

18634
16:00:31,700 --> 16:00:32,900
I'm still botting, I'm still botting.

18635
16:00:38,620 --> 16:00:39,580
Nice, let's use, let's use.

18636
16:00:39,960 --> 16:00:40,500
I'm on Groot.

18637
16:00:44,480 --> 16:00:45,420
I'm on Strange.

18638
16:00:46,260 --> 16:00:46,960
Strange is low.

18639
16:00:47,120 --> 16:00:47,560
Strange is half.

18640
16:00:52,840 --> 16:00:53,480
Do not low.

18641
16:00:56,720 --> 16:00:57,360
One win.

18642
16:01:00,660 --> 16:01:01,400
Groot half.

18643
16:01:01,940 --> 16:01:03,040
Play in the open, play in the open.

18644
16:01:03,340 --> 16:01:04,280
Groot's gonna have a worse time.

18645
16:01:12,080 --> 16:01:13,540
There's a Starler behind us, careful.

18646
16:01:14,040 --> 16:01:14,960
I got both, I got both.

18647
16:01:15,500 --> 16:01:16,300
I'm helping him.

18648
16:01:17,840 --> 16:01:18,720
I'm ulting, man.

18649
16:01:20,340 --> 16:01:20,940
Where's the Strange?

18650
16:01:23,240 --> 16:01:24,700
I still botted, I still botted.

18651
16:01:30,940 --> 16:01:32,720
No more second chance, no more second chance.

18652
16:01:33,480 --> 16:01:34,000
Strange one.

18653
16:01:36,460 --> 16:01:37,040
No hook.

18654
16:01:38,000 --> 16:01:39,340
I have no heals, I have no heals here.

18655
16:01:40,340 --> 16:01:41,540
Strange has one, Strange has one.

18656
16:01:44,320 --> 16:01:45,640
Strange has got Strange, I got Strange.

18657
16:01:47,480 --> 16:01:48,040
No hook.

18658
16:01:48,580 --> 16:01:48,960
Watch out.

18659
16:01:49,680 --> 16:01:50,340
Don't die, don't die.

18660
16:01:51,860 --> 16:01:52,680
I'm moving, moving.

18661
16:01:53,080 --> 16:01:53,400
Low gank.

18662
16:01:54,140 --> 16:01:54,900
I'm trying to.

18663
16:01:55,400 --> 16:01:56,720
Low gank one, low gank one.

18664
16:01:57,300 --> 16:01:58,480
He's healed, he's healed, he's healed.

18665
16:02:00,300 --> 16:02:04,510
Could be the key to solving our crisis.

18666
16:02:04,510 --> 16:02:05,310
Just chill, chill, chill.

18667
16:02:10,380 --> 16:02:11,740
I still botted, I still botted.

18668
16:02:13,300 --> 16:02:14,580
Good, good, good.

18669
16:02:14,680 --> 16:02:15,840
We need to get a kill here.

18670
16:02:16,220 --> 16:02:17,440
We have to touch point, we have to touch point.

18671
16:02:20,460 --> 16:02:21,180
No lamp.

18672
16:02:23,180 --> 16:02:25,460
Oh, I got hooked.

18673
16:02:28,340 --> 16:02:29,460
Oh my god.

18674
16:02:31,360 --> 16:02:32,920
Guys, we have low gank on our ass.

18675
16:02:32,920 --> 16:02:34,640
I'm cocooning on cart.

18676
16:02:35,480 --> 16:02:37,180
Oh, that's bad for me.

18677
16:02:39,360 --> 16:02:40,560
Oh my god.

18678
16:02:44,760 --> 16:02:45,460
Okay, okay.

18679
16:02:46,160 --> 16:02:46,520
One win.

18680
16:02:46,600 --> 16:02:47,700
I tried to ult.

18681
16:02:48,040 --> 16:02:49,100
No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

18682
16:02:50,680 --> 16:02:52,300
I tried to cancel this.

18683
16:02:53,060 --> 16:02:53,560
Okay, okay.

18684
16:02:54,720 --> 16:02:55,700
Watch out, Wolverine.

18685
16:02:56,140 --> 16:02:57,300
No hook, no hook.

18686
16:02:58,300 --> 16:02:59,640
I should take an early fight then.

18687
16:03:00,640 --> 16:03:01,380
Yeah, I'm going in.

18688
16:03:01,700 --> 16:03:02,640
Watch out, watch out, Wolverine.

18689
16:03:04,760 --> 16:03:05,760
Watch out over here.

18690
16:03:08,850 --> 16:03:10,430
We should be close to Brutal.

18691
16:03:12,330 --> 16:03:13,530
Wolverine, Wolverine, Wolverine.

18692
16:03:13,670 --> 16:03:15,190
I got, I got you.

18693
16:03:15,590 --> 16:03:16,070
Oh.

18694
16:03:17,530 --> 16:03:18,850
I'm trying to slow bomb you.

18695
16:03:19,250 --> 16:03:20,070
I got your slow bomb.

18696
16:03:24,950 --> 16:03:25,910
Oh no.

18697
16:03:29,010 --> 16:03:32,230
I have rez here, but...

18698
16:03:37,790 --> 16:03:38,330
They used to move.

18699
16:03:40,050 --> 16:03:40,610
They used...

18700
16:03:42,150 --> 16:03:44,050
I can touch, I can touch.

18701
16:03:44,410 --> 16:03:44,790
I'm slow bombing.

18702
16:03:49,210 --> 16:03:49,770
I'm ulting.

18703
16:03:54,870 --> 16:03:55,810
I'm dead, you have to stay alive.

18704
16:04:01,850 --> 16:04:02,610
I actually want to go.

18705
16:04:02,790 --> 16:04:03,630
Go on the backline, backline, backline.

18706
16:04:05,810 --> 16:04:06,830
Wolverine one, Wolverine one.

18707
16:04:07,830 --> 16:04:08,830
Luna one, Luna one.

18708
16:04:09,010 --> 16:04:09,430
Luna, Luna.

18709
16:04:09,750 --> 16:04:11,010
I'm on Groot, I'm on Groot, I'm on Groot.

18710
16:04:12,410 --> 16:04:13,190
No passive, Wolverine.

18711
16:04:14,050 --> 16:04:14,370
Change.

18712
16:04:16,570 --> 16:04:17,630
Wolverine, no passive.

18713
16:04:17,890 --> 16:04:18,910
They still have one more fight.

18714
16:04:19,090 --> 16:04:19,750
They still have one more fight.

18715
16:04:21,490 --> 16:04:22,810
Or we push, or we push.

18716
16:04:23,030 --> 16:04:23,510
Or they can TP.

18717
16:04:26,570 --> 16:04:28,010
I have slow bomb, but...

18718
16:04:28,010 --> 16:04:28,910
I'm going, I'm going.

18719
16:04:28,910 --> 16:04:29,430
I'm going, I'm going.

18720
16:04:29,670 --> 16:04:36,090
I thought they were going to TP.

18721
16:04:36,190 --> 16:04:36,370
It's fine.

18722
16:04:37,010 --> 16:04:38,250
They're just trying to counter it.

18723
16:04:38,310 --> 16:04:38,750
I almost have ult.

18724
16:04:39,110 --> 16:04:40,350
No dying, no dying.

18725
16:04:40,490 --> 16:04:40,810
Kill the Lyra.

18726
16:04:44,570 --> 16:04:45,250
That's really good.

18727
16:04:45,590 --> 16:04:46,030
I got hook.

18728
16:04:46,450 --> 16:04:46,950
Let's go.

18729
16:04:47,230 --> 16:04:47,470
Watch out.

18730
16:04:48,790 --> 16:04:49,890
I have slow bomb now, I have slow bomb now.

18731
16:04:51,970 --> 16:04:53,010
I'm on Groot, I'm on Groot.

18732
16:04:53,190 --> 16:04:54,110
Groot's one, Groot's one.

18733
16:04:54,590 --> 16:04:55,130
One win.

18734
16:04:55,130 --> 16:04:55,830
One win, bro.

18735
16:04:55,970 --> 16:04:56,370
One win.

18736
16:04:57,510 --> 16:04:59,170
Guys, there's a bug ult, thank god.

18737
16:04:59,310 --> 16:04:59,430
Okay.

18738
16:05:03,890 --> 16:05:05,130
Oh my god.

18739
16:05:05,130 --> 16:05:07,510
I'm supposed to be an Adam main.

18740
16:05:07,830 --> 16:05:11,260
I'm fucking my play.

18741
16:05:12,000 --> 16:05:14,400
I might as well...

18742
16:05:14,400 --> 16:05:16,720
Oh my god.

18743
16:05:17,920 --> 16:05:21,760
I might as well be a fucking Adam player.

18744
16:05:22,100 --> 16:05:23,020
I literally...

18745
16:05:23,020 --> 16:05:26,280
I literally fucking win every Adam game.

18746
16:05:26,880 --> 16:05:28,760
Oh my god.

18747
16:05:31,600 --> 16:05:33,260
I'm trusting Adam.

18748
16:05:33,260 --> 16:05:33,840
Adam.

18749
16:05:35,180 --> 16:05:37,500
God, I'm a fucking Adam player.

18750
16:05:38,340 --> 16:05:39,600
I'm free.

18751
16:05:40,020 --> 16:05:41,140
I'm free.

18752
16:05:45,360 --> 16:05:47,780
I'm just an Adam player.

18753
16:05:48,040 --> 16:05:48,340
Jeez.

18754
16:05:51,280 --> 16:05:53,120
Oh my god.

18755
16:06:01,100 --> 16:06:01,920
You're right.

18756
16:06:05,840 --> 16:06:07,280
I can't.

18757
16:06:07,900 --> 16:06:09,400
You know, I can't.

18758
16:06:09,460 --> 16:06:10,140
It's like...

18759
16:06:10,140 --> 16:06:12,960
It's like I'm like an alcoholic and they...

18760
16:06:12,960 --> 16:06:15,600
But like, I'm on like sobriety.

18761
16:06:15,960 --> 16:06:18,380
And I'm like 20 months sober.

18762
16:06:18,800 --> 16:06:21,020
And then they were like...

18763
16:06:22,100 --> 16:06:24,380
I'm like 20 months sober.

18764
16:06:24,800 --> 16:06:25,580
And then...

18765
16:06:25,580 --> 16:06:26,980
And then he's like...

18766
16:06:26,980 --> 16:06:28,200
Just one sip, Doki.

18767
16:06:28,620 --> 16:06:30,440
Just one sip.

18768
16:06:34,600 --> 16:06:36,760
Oh my god.

18769
16:06:37,000 --> 16:06:38,260
I just...

18770
16:06:39,200 --> 16:06:40,340
I can't.

18771
16:06:40,840 --> 16:06:42,400
Oh my god, you're right.

18772
16:06:42,900 --> 16:06:44,020
You're right.

18773
16:06:47,080 --> 16:06:47,800
Let's...

18774
16:06:47,800 --> 16:06:49,460
Oh my god.

18775
16:06:50,180 --> 16:06:52,740
Oh my god, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

18776
16:07:39,350 --> 16:07:41,010
I'll finish my story.

18777
16:07:41,410 --> 16:07:43,370
And then, like, I take that one sip.

18778
16:07:43,370 --> 16:07:45,070
And then I wake up...

18779
16:07:45,070 --> 16:07:46,110
I black out.

18780
16:07:46,190 --> 16:07:47,890
And then I wake up in a bar.

18781
16:07:49,750 --> 16:07:51,550
I wake up in a bar.

18782
16:07:52,070 --> 16:07:53,030
And then I'm like...

18783
16:07:53,030 --> 16:07:53,690
Oh no.

18784
16:07:54,170 --> 16:07:55,350
It's happened again.

18785
16:08:02,010 --> 16:08:03,250
Oh my god.

18786
16:08:04,050 --> 16:08:04,750
Okay, guys.

18787
16:08:04,930 --> 16:08:06,390
But what about one more win?

18788
16:08:08,150 --> 16:08:09,390
What about...

18789
16:08:10,010 --> 16:08:11,370
What about one...

18790
16:08:12,450 --> 16:08:13,050
Guys!

18791
16:08:14,230 --> 16:08:14,930
Guys, okay.

18792
16:08:15,410 --> 16:08:16,470
Last one.

18793
16:08:16,590 --> 16:08:17,390
For real, guys.

18794
16:08:17,450 --> 16:08:17,990
This is...

18795
16:08:17,990 --> 16:08:18,810
For real.

18796
16:08:18,990 --> 16:08:20,130
My last one.

18797
16:08:21,770 --> 16:08:22,370
Guys!

18798
16:08:24,770 --> 16:08:25,710
For real.

18799
16:08:26,250 --> 16:08:27,610
This is my last one.

18800
16:08:27,790 --> 16:08:30,070
I would never lie to you guys.

18801
16:08:33,170 --> 16:08:34,470
Guys, I promise.

18802
16:08:34,630 --> 16:08:35,850
What if I give you this?

18803
16:08:36,650 --> 16:08:37,110
Guys!

18804
16:08:37,430 --> 16:08:39,890
But what if I give you this, though?

18805
16:08:43,750 --> 16:08:44,870
I would never!

18806
16:08:45,250 --> 16:08:46,370
This is the last one.

18807
16:08:46,450 --> 16:08:47,010
I swear.

18808
16:08:47,430 --> 16:08:48,370
Whatever happens...

18809
16:08:49,490 --> 16:08:51,270
Oh, but then I'll be less than 100 points.

18810
16:08:51,370 --> 16:08:51,730
Oh god.

18811
16:08:51,970 --> 16:08:53,370
Okay, but like...

18812
16:08:55,230 --> 16:08:57,390
What do you mean I'm holding Bulgur hostage?

18813
16:08:57,630 --> 16:08:57,790
What?

18814
16:08:57,850 --> 16:08:59,750
He tweeted that I'm holding him hostage?

18815
16:09:00,610 --> 16:09:03,650
I was ready to leave four games ago!

18816
16:09:04,430 --> 16:09:05,810
Five games ago!

18817
16:09:07,290 --> 16:09:09,630
Which hero do you think you want to meet today?

18818
16:09:09,630 --> 16:09:12,030
I'm fucking BL hostage!

18819
16:09:12,650 --> 16:09:15,550
I was ready to leave five!

18820
16:09:16,690 --> 16:09:17,790
Yes, I was.

18821
16:09:17,950 --> 16:09:19,230
I was so ready.

18822
16:09:19,590 --> 16:09:20,770
I was like...

18823
16:09:20,770 --> 16:09:22,510
We're gonna leave.

18824
16:09:22,810 --> 16:09:24,990
I will win 130 points.

18825
16:09:26,310 --> 16:09:27,750
And like...

18826
16:09:27,750 --> 16:09:29,170
It's fine.

18827
16:09:29,670 --> 16:09:30,790
I'm fucking banning Hawkeye.

18828
16:09:32,270 --> 16:09:33,810
It's too addicting.

18829
16:09:36,770 --> 16:09:37,290
Okay.

18830
16:09:38,070 --> 16:09:38,450
Alright.

18831
16:09:38,690 --> 16:09:39,370
Last one.

18832
16:09:40,410 --> 16:09:41,210
For real.

18833
16:09:43,890 --> 16:09:45,890
This is my descent into madness.

18834
16:09:47,090 --> 16:09:47,910
Hey guys!

18835
16:09:49,010 --> 16:09:50,410
Oh my god!

18836
16:09:51,970 --> 16:09:53,090
Thank you for the...

18837
16:09:53,090 --> 16:09:54,270
Thank you for watching, bro.

18838
16:09:55,010 --> 16:09:55,870
Thank you.

18839
16:09:56,290 --> 16:09:56,730
Thank you.

18840
16:09:57,410 --> 16:09:58,710
You win, you win, you win, you win.

18841
16:09:58,970 --> 16:10:00,270
Guys, thanks for watching.

18842
16:10:01,370 --> 16:10:01,890
You win, you win.

18843
16:10:03,130 --> 16:10:03,650
Guys!

18844
16:10:03,650 --> 16:10:07,210
In four days, I'll return back to normal.

18845
16:10:07,830 --> 16:10:08,390
Everybody.

18846
16:10:09,150 --> 16:10:09,470
Everybody.

18847
16:10:09,730 --> 16:10:12,990
In four days, things will be back to normal.

18848
16:10:14,830 --> 16:10:17,130
Also, if you're new here, my name is Doki Bird.

18849
16:10:17,490 --> 16:10:18,830
I usually stream on YouTube.

18850
16:10:19,410 --> 16:10:20,590
But I'm here...

18851
16:10:22,390 --> 16:10:27,350
I'm here on Twitch because I really want to hit top 500 in Marvel Rivals.

18852
16:10:28,690 --> 16:10:29,250
And...

18853
16:10:29,250 --> 16:10:30,930
Doki, you need to pull out the Mantis.

18854
16:10:31,210 --> 16:10:31,730
Okay.

18855
16:10:31,970 --> 16:10:32,690
Here we go.

18856
16:10:33,450 --> 16:10:33,970
And...

18857
16:10:34,910 --> 16:10:35,770
We're here.

18858
16:10:36,050 --> 16:10:37,150
We're here.

18859
16:10:40,330 --> 16:10:44,210
Someday, I want to be able to cope as half as good as Kofi B.

18860
16:10:44,670 --> 16:10:45,630
Not so dead.

18861
16:10:45,850 --> 16:10:47,790
Thank you for the thousand bitties.

18862
16:10:48,350 --> 16:10:49,290
Guys, it's okay.

18863
16:10:50,590 --> 16:10:51,650
Guys, it's okay.

18864
16:10:51,790 --> 16:10:52,690
After this...

18865
16:10:53,770 --> 16:10:55,850
After this, we'll be free.

18866
16:10:56,110 --> 16:10:59,530
And then, like, today, I won't be streaming Marvel Rivals.

18867
16:10:59,730 --> 16:11:00,490
I won't.

18868
16:11:02,170 --> 16:11:02,690
Yeah.

18869
16:11:06,330 --> 16:11:07,370
After this...

18870
16:11:08,110 --> 16:11:12,770
After this, we won't have a stream later today.

18871
16:11:13,270 --> 16:11:14,890
I might play off-stream, though.

18872
16:11:14,910 --> 16:11:16,170
I'm not gonna lie to you guys.

18873
16:11:16,230 --> 16:11:17,810
I will absolutely play off-stream.

18874
16:11:18,870 --> 16:11:20,690
But after I wake up...

18875
16:11:20,690 --> 16:11:21,710
After I wake up...

18876
16:11:21,710 --> 16:11:24,730
Whatever time I fucking wake up, I don't even know.

18877
16:11:25,330 --> 16:11:27,630
But then...

18878
16:11:34,010 --> 16:11:34,730
Strange.

18879
16:11:34,910 --> 16:11:38,670
A rat.

18880
16:11:39,310 --> 16:11:42,470
They have a rat.

18881
16:11:43,150 --> 16:11:44,470
Thank fucking...

18882
16:11:44,470 --> 16:11:45,530
There's a Magnia up top.

18883
16:11:55,940 --> 16:11:56,540
Oh my god.

18884
16:11:58,320 --> 16:11:59,780
I don't have any leaves left.

18885
16:12:04,340 --> 16:12:05,180
Oh my god.

18886
16:12:07,320 --> 16:12:08,380
They have triple support.

18887
16:12:08,740 --> 16:12:09,260
They're TPing.

18888
16:12:09,900 --> 16:12:11,340
They're gonna TP the doorways.

18889
16:12:11,640 --> 16:12:12,520
So you gotta get out of there.

18890
16:12:14,980 --> 16:12:15,880
Can you guys touch?

18891
16:12:17,580 --> 16:12:18,720
Our Starlord can.

18892
16:12:19,520 --> 16:12:20,280
I'm TPing.

18893
16:12:20,480 --> 16:12:21,440
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

18894
16:12:21,600 --> 16:12:21,780
Here.

18895
16:12:22,320 --> 16:12:22,760
I got you.

18896
16:12:24,800 --> 16:12:27,040
We win this, we win this.

18897
16:12:27,040 --> 16:12:27,520
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

18898
16:12:28,020 --> 16:12:28,880
Punisher, Punisher, right side.

18899
16:12:31,200 --> 16:12:31,900
I'm on point.

18900
16:12:33,080 --> 16:12:33,560
Where is Strange?

18901
16:12:33,620 --> 16:12:34,460
Strange is here.

18902
16:12:35,580 --> 16:12:36,300
Oh, nevermind.

18903
16:12:37,440 --> 16:12:38,140
Where'd Muna go?

18904
16:12:38,140 --> 16:12:38,920
Punisher's low.

18905
16:12:41,120 --> 16:12:42,320
I don't have ult yet.

18906
16:12:42,720 --> 16:12:45,560
I'm 89.

18907
16:12:47,220 --> 16:12:53,650
I have ult here.

18908
16:12:59,020 --> 16:13:00,850
I might be staggered, I can't tell.

18909
16:13:01,950 --> 16:13:02,530
Might be.

18910
16:13:03,670 --> 16:13:04,490
What if you kill them?

18911
16:13:05,410 --> 16:13:06,010
I left.

18912
16:13:09,070 --> 16:13:10,090
Yeah, do you have Punisher ult?

18913
16:13:11,210 --> 16:13:13,570
I have, yeah, yeah.

18914
16:13:13,650 --> 16:13:14,350
They have Strange ult.

18915
16:13:15,590 --> 16:13:17,230
I'll try and save it for Strange.

18916
16:13:20,850 --> 16:13:21,630
I see Strange.

18917
16:13:28,810 --> 16:13:29,630
There's a Mantis!

18918
16:13:29,750 --> 16:13:30,250
Mantis half!

18919
16:13:30,850 --> 16:13:31,690
Oh, he's so low.

18920
16:13:35,790 --> 16:13:37,050
I didn't see where the Strange is.

18921
16:13:37,570 --> 16:13:38,950
He's on frontline, he's frontline-ing.

18922
16:13:42,800 --> 16:13:44,220
I have to use this.

18923
16:13:44,940 --> 16:13:45,820
I got it, I got it, I got it.

18924
16:13:48,280 --> 16:13:48,840
I'm fine.

18925
16:13:51,480 --> 16:13:52,460
I'm trying to get you.

18926
16:13:52,640 --> 16:13:53,360
I can't see you.

18927
16:13:53,400 --> 16:13:53,920
I got you, I got you.

18928
16:13:54,060 --> 16:13:54,860
I'm damage boosting you.

18929
16:13:56,780 --> 16:13:57,540
You're damage boosted.

18930
16:13:57,960 --> 16:13:58,680
Left side, left side.

18931
16:13:59,260 --> 16:13:59,860
I'm going, I'm going.

18932
16:14:02,220 --> 16:14:02,960
He's out, he's out.

18933
16:14:03,440 --> 16:14:04,020
You're damage boosted.

18934
16:14:04,120 --> 16:14:04,360
That's okay.

18935
16:14:08,620 --> 16:14:09,660
I don't see you all.

18936
16:14:09,660 --> 16:14:10,660
I got you.

18937
16:14:16,360 --> 16:14:18,480
I don't have enough leads for this.

18938
16:14:30,870 --> 16:14:32,790
I can damage boost whatever.

18939
16:14:38,880 --> 16:14:39,760
I'm frozen.

18940
16:14:40,240 --> 16:14:40,960
I'm trying to get to you.

18941
16:14:41,060 --> 16:14:41,740
He's looking for it.

18942
16:14:45,280 --> 16:14:48,240
By the eye of Agamotto.

18943
16:14:51,580 --> 16:14:54,060
Oh my god, the punish roll.

18944
16:14:57,640 --> 16:14:59,880
Oh my god.

18945
16:15:01,540 --> 16:15:02,860
They hit a checkpoint.

18946
16:15:03,480 --> 16:15:05,700
They're under a lot of pressure and that's just with the Punisher.

18947
16:15:05,820 --> 16:15:07,080
It's actually kind of crazy.

18948
16:15:07,820 --> 16:15:09,580
They have only Punisher damage.

18949
16:15:10,740 --> 16:15:12,660
And there's triple support, so...

18950
16:15:12,660 --> 16:15:14,420
They're like, healing everything.

18951
16:15:14,420 --> 16:15:15,400
They're kind of low.

18952
16:15:20,030 --> 16:15:20,350
Alright.

18953
16:15:22,690 --> 16:15:23,010
Nice.

18954
16:15:25,050 --> 16:15:25,930
He's asleep, he's asleep.

18955
16:15:26,650 --> 16:15:27,010
He's half.

18956
16:15:28,570 --> 16:15:29,390
He's one, he's one, he's one.

18957
16:15:30,910 --> 16:15:31,230
Oh

18958
16:15:35,290 --> 16:15:35,870
my god.

18959
16:15:39,510 --> 16:15:40,210
I'm gonna die here.

18960
16:15:40,950 --> 16:15:42,670
And they're gonna TP or spawn if I die here.

18961
16:15:43,330 --> 16:15:44,310
I'm trying, I'm ulting them.

18962
16:15:45,870 --> 16:15:46,670
Yeah, go, go, go.

18963
16:15:46,750 --> 16:15:47,350
We need to steal that climb.

18964
16:15:50,710 --> 16:15:51,070
I'm asleep.

18965
16:15:51,650 --> 16:15:52,610
I woke you up.

18966
16:15:53,710 --> 16:15:54,910
I'm trying to keep you up.

18967
16:15:55,990 --> 16:15:57,770
Oh, strangers low, strangers so low.

18968
16:15:57,970 --> 16:15:58,570
Oh, nevermind.

18969
16:15:59,230 --> 16:16:00,330
I can heal you, I can heal you.

18970
16:16:00,430 --> 16:16:01,070
I got you, I got you.

18971
16:16:04,190 --> 16:16:05,730
You only have me as support.

18972
16:16:08,890 --> 16:16:09,550
Tank's on me.

18973
16:16:09,830 --> 16:16:11,190
Strangers low, strangers half, strangers half.

18974
16:16:13,490 --> 16:16:14,870
I'm the only one supporting right now.

18975
16:16:15,510 --> 16:16:16,910
So please, don't die.

18976
16:16:17,290 --> 16:16:17,970
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

18977
16:16:22,370 --> 16:16:23,170
Aluna's back.

18978
16:16:31,180 --> 16:16:31,840
Did they use strangers?

18979
16:16:32,680 --> 16:16:33,080
No.

18980
16:16:39,900 --> 16:16:41,000
I'm backing up a little.

18981
16:16:41,020 --> 16:16:42,260
They're just looking for it, left side.

18982
16:16:42,380 --> 16:16:42,600
Yeah.

18983
16:16:42,700 --> 16:16:43,200
And he's flanking.

18984
16:16:49,640 --> 16:16:50,180
Oh no.

18985
16:16:50,680 --> 16:16:51,300
I'm gonna die here.

18986
16:16:52,680 --> 16:16:54,260
They're gonna strange ult after this though.

18987
16:16:55,660 --> 16:16:56,580
I have my ult up though.

18988
16:17:03,610 --> 16:17:05,270
There's a mantis on you.

18989
16:17:10,240 --> 16:17:11,280
Strange, strange, right side.

18990
16:17:11,840 --> 16:17:12,640
I'm ulting this.

18991
16:17:18,910 --> 16:17:20,270
I couldn't do anything.

18992
16:17:22,630 --> 16:17:23,390
Help me, help me, help me.

18993
16:17:23,910 --> 16:17:25,330
They're pushing point, they're pushing point.

18994
16:17:25,530 --> 16:17:26,130
Point, point, point, point.

18995
16:17:30,870 --> 16:17:31,650
Chill, chill, bro.

18996
16:17:36,840 --> 16:17:39,680
Strange is stuck, strange is stuck, strange is stuck, strange is stuck.

18997
16:17:41,400 --> 16:17:42,560
He's stopping me!

18998
16:17:46,520 --> 16:17:47,260
Mag on me.

18999
16:17:47,960 --> 16:17:49,020
I'm trying to help you right now.

19000
16:17:49,180 --> 16:17:50,640
We are undefeated!

19001
16:17:54,310 --> 16:17:56,350
Oh my god, there's nothing I could do.

19002
16:17:57,050 --> 16:17:59,050
I am ready to put on a show!

19003
16:17:59,590 --> 16:18:00,710
Someone needs to touch point.

19004
16:18:05,910 --> 16:18:07,810
Aluna almost has ult if someone touch point.

19005
16:18:08,070 --> 16:18:08,710
Stay point, stay point.

19006
16:18:09,390 --> 16:18:09,850
Nice, nice.

19007
16:18:13,750 --> 16:18:15,030
Help her, help her, help her.

19008
16:18:16,110 --> 16:18:17,190
Rocket's so low!

19009
16:18:23,510 --> 16:18:25,630
I'm on it.

19010
16:18:37,990 --> 16:18:39,120
Oh my god.

19011
16:18:42,010 --> 16:18:42,920
50 seconds, guys.

19012
16:18:43,240 --> 16:18:45,200
We can win.

19013
16:18:47,280 --> 16:18:48,440
Oh my god.

19014
16:18:49,940 --> 16:18:50,800
Is it me?

19015
16:18:50,960 --> 16:18:51,880
I don't know what to do here.

19016
16:18:58,600 --> 16:19:00,560
Oh, we need a triple support.

19017
16:19:01,980 --> 16:19:02,380
Maybe.

19018
16:19:03,260 --> 16:19:04,620
Do you think Psylocke is good now?

19019
16:19:04,800 --> 16:19:05,080
Punisher?

19020
16:19:05,300 --> 16:19:06,040
You can try Punisher.

19021
16:19:08,780 --> 16:19:09,180
Wolverine.

19022
16:19:09,280 --> 16:19:10,280
Do you play Wolverine, Vixen?

19023
16:19:11,280 --> 16:19:12,820
Nah, not a meta character.

19024
16:19:13,380 --> 16:19:13,780
Okay, okay.

19025
16:19:14,020 --> 16:19:15,400
Mistakes, do you play Wolverine?

19026
16:19:16,480 --> 16:19:18,060
Do we have a Wolverine player?

19027
16:19:24,030 --> 16:19:26,430
It's time to learn Wolverine live.

19028
16:19:28,710 --> 16:19:33,370
Oh my god.

19029
16:19:35,050 --> 16:19:36,830
Oh my god.

19030
16:19:37,870 --> 16:19:39,010
I got baited.

19031
16:19:39,190 --> 16:19:39,770
Again.

19032
16:19:42,310 --> 16:19:46,090
How do I always get baited?

19033
16:19:46,350 --> 16:19:47,830
How do I always...

19034
16:19:51,150 --> 16:19:53,130
How do I always get baited?

19035
16:19:53,690 --> 16:19:54,150
Ow!

19036
16:19:55,510 --> 16:19:58,970
I let myself get baited again.

19037
16:20:02,950 --> 16:20:05,390
Who could've seen it coming?

19038
16:20:05,790 --> 16:20:09,130
Who could've seen it coming, everybody?

19039
16:20:15,980 --> 16:20:19,340
It truly is unfortunate indeed.

19040
16:20:21,980 --> 16:20:22,720
We could've...

19041
16:20:23,480 --> 16:20:25,680
Who could've predicted this, guys?

19042
16:20:25,940 --> 16:20:27,580
Not me, that's for sure.

19043
16:20:48,050 --> 16:20:50,070
There's a Magneto just blocking us.

19044
16:20:50,570 --> 16:20:51,650
Magneto's one, Magneto's low!

19045
16:21:00,380 --> 16:21:01,080
Oh my god.

19046
16:21:07,180 --> 16:21:07,420
I'm with you.

19047
16:21:07,620 --> 16:21:08,140
You with me?

19048
16:21:12,780 --> 16:21:15,000
Yeah, I have ult here too.

19049
16:21:23,010 --> 16:21:24,050
We need to live this.

19050
16:21:24,950 --> 16:21:25,390
I'm trying.

19051
16:21:29,240 --> 16:21:29,800
I'm alive.

19052
16:21:31,540 --> 16:21:32,600
I can ult after this.

19053
16:21:33,240 --> 16:21:34,600
If we live this, we can win this.

19054
16:21:35,600 --> 16:21:36,760
I lost her Luna.

19055
16:21:38,080 --> 16:21:39,380
I don't have enough leaves.

19056
16:21:39,540 --> 16:21:40,180
I can still ult.

19057
16:21:40,300 --> 16:21:40,940
I'm leaving.

19058
16:21:42,420 --> 16:21:43,700
These ults were...

19059
16:21:49,020 --> 16:21:50,190
Oh my god, I got fucking...

19060
16:21:50,880 --> 16:21:52,220
Oh my god!

19061
16:21:59,120 --> 16:22:00,060
I got baited.

19062
16:22:01,600 --> 16:22:02,280
I got...

19063
16:22:02,280 --> 16:22:03,700
I got baited, chat.

19064
16:22:04,000 --> 16:22:05,700
I got baited.

19065
16:22:06,100 --> 16:22:07,080
I'm gonna go in, are you ready?

19066
16:22:07,740 --> 16:22:08,440
Help me out, help me out.

19067
16:22:09,140 --> 16:22:10,100
I got you, I got you, I got you.

19068
16:22:11,220 --> 16:22:11,900
I'm going in.

19069
16:22:12,440 --> 16:22:12,840
Summing now.

19070
16:22:18,990 --> 16:22:20,370
Oh my god.

19071
16:22:26,980 --> 16:22:28,060
I can't.

19072
16:22:28,140 --> 16:22:30,300
I can't.

19073
16:22:30,320 --> 16:22:32,660
I can't deal with this fucking fear.

19074
16:22:33,800 --> 16:22:35,920
This fear magneto!

19075
16:22:38,140 --> 16:22:39,140
I'm coming back now.

19076
16:22:39,220 --> 16:22:40,060
There's nobody pushing cart.

19077
16:22:41,840 --> 16:22:43,260
There's a Punisher on the turret.

19078
16:22:43,380 --> 16:22:43,980
Punisher's on turret.

19079
16:22:45,560 --> 16:22:46,200
Punisher's low.

19080
16:22:52,220 --> 16:22:53,460
I want supports, I want supports.

19081
16:22:54,300 --> 16:22:54,720
I'm with you.

19082
16:22:54,780 --> 16:22:55,540
Is that Mantis on me?

19083
16:22:55,760 --> 16:22:57,060
Luna 1, Luna 1, Luna 1.

19084
16:22:57,560 --> 16:22:58,980
Mantis 1, Mantis 1, Mantis 1.

19085
16:23:03,380 --> 16:23:03,920
Strange health.

19086
16:23:04,820 --> 16:23:05,740
I got ult.

19087
16:23:10,840 --> 16:23:13,260
I'm 80% but I have it so...

19088
16:23:17,800 --> 16:23:19,200
Punisher, Punisher, Punisher, Punisher.

19089
16:23:21,000 --> 16:23:22,140
Strange health, strange 1.

19090
16:23:22,140 --> 16:23:23,780
Strange 1, strange 1.

19091
16:23:24,120 --> 16:23:24,700
Strange 1.

19092
16:23:25,080 --> 16:23:25,720
I'm dead here.

19093
16:23:26,320 --> 16:23:26,840
I don't want this.

19094
16:23:30,350 --> 16:23:31,490
Oh my god.

19095
16:23:32,490 --> 16:23:33,370
I can ult past.

19096
16:23:36,330 --> 16:23:37,690
Is Luna's push up?

19097
16:23:37,990 --> 16:23:38,570
I want Luna here.

19098
16:23:38,890 --> 16:23:39,310
Luna, Luna.

19099
16:23:39,750 --> 16:23:42,310
I've slept.

19100
16:23:43,150 --> 16:23:43,710
Mantis health.

19101
16:23:45,490 --> 16:23:47,130
They used both stuns.

19102
16:23:47,130 --> 16:23:47,350
Okay.

19103
16:23:53,610 --> 16:23:55,050
I'm going in as well.

19104
16:23:55,090 --> 16:23:55,650
Can I help you?

19105
16:23:55,970 --> 16:23:56,690
I got you.

19106
16:23:59,210 --> 16:23:59,930
I can't...

19107
16:24:03,070 --> 16:24:03,770
You're slow.

19108
16:24:08,830 --> 16:24:09,550
I'm dead.

19109
16:24:09,850 --> 16:24:11,130
I'm backing out, I'm backing out.

19110
16:24:19,460 --> 16:24:21,300
I am strengthened for battle.

19111
16:24:25,220 --> 16:24:26,260
Jesus Christ.

19112
16:24:26,580 --> 16:24:27,820
I might want to watch out over here.

19113
16:24:30,170 --> 16:24:31,990
My life energy flows stronger.

19114
16:24:38,270 --> 16:24:41,290
Here, here, here, here, here, here.

19115
16:24:42,550 --> 16:24:43,070
Here.

19116
16:24:43,370 --> 16:24:44,030
We got him, we got him.

19117
16:24:45,290 --> 16:24:45,810
Maltus.

19118
16:24:46,590 --> 16:24:47,310
Push up.

19119
16:24:47,690 --> 16:24:48,710
Mantis, Mantis 1.

19120
16:24:50,450 --> 16:24:51,090
I'm asleep.

19121
16:24:51,110 --> 16:24:52,670
We are undefeatable!

19122
16:24:54,210 --> 16:24:56,310
I'm pushing cart, I'm pushing cart right now.

19123
16:24:58,730 --> 16:24:59,610
They're like...

19124
16:25:02,680 --> 16:25:03,640
Mantis 1, Mantis 1.

19125
16:25:04,560 --> 16:25:05,200
Strange 1.

19126
16:25:05,900 --> 16:25:06,860
Strange half, strange half.

19127
16:25:07,080 --> 16:25:07,740
Wait, do you have Mantis?

19128
16:25:08,440 --> 16:25:08,980
Oh, thanks.

19129
16:25:09,360 --> 16:25:10,740
There's a rocky raccoon in the cubby.

19130
16:25:11,580 --> 16:25:11,940
By himself.

19131
16:25:15,200 --> 16:25:16,000
Don't die, don't die.

19132
16:25:16,340 --> 16:25:17,380
Hold the corner, hold the corner.

19133
16:25:18,560 --> 16:25:19,600
I'm hiding up here.

19134
16:25:24,100 --> 16:25:25,080
Oh my god.

19135
16:25:29,780 --> 16:25:30,660
I'm dead.

19136
16:25:31,420 --> 16:25:33,680
I'm going to try to save you.

19137
16:25:40,010 --> 16:25:40,630
Oh.

19138
16:25:42,210 --> 16:25:43,650
Mantis has returned.

19139
16:25:44,030 --> 16:25:45,270
Okay, I have my ult for the next fight.

19140
16:25:46,430 --> 16:25:47,210
We have a portal.

19141
16:25:47,710 --> 16:25:48,750
I have Mantis.

19142
16:25:52,500 --> 16:25:53,700
Is this the last fight?

19143
16:25:54,840 --> 16:25:55,720
Yeah, it is.

19144
16:25:57,520 --> 16:25:59,120
I'm opening a portal.

19145
16:26:00,320 --> 16:26:01,880
Get that vehicle moving again!

19146
16:26:05,510 --> 16:26:06,510
They used this.

19147
16:26:06,510 --> 16:26:07,110
Shake it off!

19148
16:26:07,790 --> 16:26:09,050
Down to 30 seconds!

19149
16:26:13,670 --> 16:26:15,090
Try to give you all the damage right now.

19150
16:26:17,730 --> 16:26:18,450
Strange, maybe?

19151
16:26:19,050 --> 16:26:19,610
Oh, I got him.

19152
16:26:22,850 --> 16:26:24,870
I see you, I see you, I see you, I see you!

19153
16:26:25,390 --> 16:26:27,270
You're my goat, you're my goat, you're my goat, you're my goat.

19154
16:26:29,110 --> 16:26:30,410
I'm pushing the cart, I'm pushing the cart.

19155
16:26:32,410 --> 16:26:33,550
There's a... there's a Punisher!

19156
16:26:34,190 --> 16:26:34,750
Double KO!

19157
16:26:38,550 --> 16:26:39,590
Vehicle reached a checkpoint.

19158
16:26:39,990 --> 16:26:40,890
Keep up the momentum!

19159
16:26:41,550 --> 16:26:43,810
Push up to get stragglers if you can.

19160
16:26:45,110 --> 16:26:46,030
I slept somebody!

19161
16:26:50,530 --> 16:26:52,130
Oh my, this is so low.

19162
16:26:57,410 --> 16:26:58,030
I'm ulting this.

19163
16:26:58,370 --> 16:26:59,210
Let's do this.

19164
16:27:11,450 --> 16:27:12,150
I don't have the health.

19165
16:27:22,590 --> 16:27:23,910
I slept somebody.

19166
16:27:35,320 --> 16:27:36,840
We got Moon Knight all here.

19167
16:27:38,500 --> 16:27:39,780
I have damage boost to you.

19168
16:27:46,220 --> 16:27:49,780
Okay, I'll save some leads for damage boost.

19169
16:27:52,160 --> 16:27:52,740
Oh no!

19170
16:27:53,280 --> 16:27:54,080
But I think we're good.

19171
16:27:54,960 --> 16:27:56,300
I slept them.

19172
16:28:01,360 --> 16:28:02,320
Damage boosting.

19173
16:28:02,540 --> 16:28:03,480
Oh my god.

19174
16:28:07,660 --> 16:28:09,580
You only have Luna heals, you only have Luna heals.

19175
16:28:11,040 --> 16:28:13,240
Where the fuck was that?

19176
16:28:14,640 --> 16:28:18,600
I literally absorbed every fucking rock!

19177
16:28:20,780 --> 16:28:23,680
I'm not like angry, it's just I'm like...

19178
16:28:24,080 --> 16:28:26,080
I'm actually like...

19179
16:28:27,740 --> 16:28:28,220
Impressed.

19180
16:28:29,780 --> 16:28:30,180
You know?

19181
16:28:32,200 --> 16:28:32,860
Strange is half.

19182
16:28:38,120 --> 16:28:38,660
I will heal.

19183
16:28:40,400 --> 16:28:41,600
Backline, backline, backline, backline.

19184
16:28:42,860 --> 16:28:43,960
Oh my, Punisher's so tanky!

19185
16:28:45,360 --> 16:28:46,220
Strange, Strange, Strange.

19186
16:28:46,560 --> 16:28:47,620
Strange, focus on Strange, please!

19187
16:28:47,760 --> 16:28:48,340
I'm on him, I'm on him.

19188
16:28:50,120 --> 16:28:51,240
She's still alive!

19189
16:28:59,600 --> 16:29:00,560
I'm just...

19190
16:29:00,560 --> 16:29:02,300
I'm just impressed!

19191
16:29:12,900 --> 16:29:14,360
They're gonna have Strange all here.

19192
16:29:23,510 --> 16:29:24,530
I can't...

19193
16:29:24,530 --> 16:29:24,990
Oh, got you.

19194
16:29:27,690 --> 16:29:29,110
Oh, I got hit!

19195
16:29:30,210 --> 16:29:31,870
Help our Luna, we can't...

19196
16:29:31,870 --> 16:29:33,070
I got...

19197
16:29:39,790 --> 16:29:42,000
I'm trying to save all.

19198
16:29:50,220 --> 16:29:52,820
Are you serious?

19199
16:29:53,340 --> 16:29:54,000
Are you serious?

19200
16:29:54,160 --> 16:29:55,080
Oh my god!

19201
16:29:58,980 --> 16:29:59,550
Why?!

19202
16:30:00,120 --> 16:30:02,380
Why is it always me?!

19203
16:30:05,420 --> 16:30:08,380
Oh my god!

19204
16:30:09,080 --> 16:30:09,890
I can't...

19205
16:30:11,020 --> 16:30:11,640
Live!

19206
16:30:16,120 --> 16:30:19,580
Where did I go?!

19207
16:30:21,240 --> 16:30:23,560
I'm just impressed at that point.

19208
16:30:23,760 --> 16:30:27,100
I'm impressed that I get Magneto ulted every time.

19209
16:30:27,300 --> 16:30:28,560
Like, I can't...

19210
16:30:28,560 --> 16:30:35,260
Like, wherever I run to, I just get Magneto ulted.

19211
16:30:36,080 --> 16:30:37,460
Oh my god!

19212
16:30:39,720 --> 16:30:40,840
We're free.

19213
16:30:40,840 --> 16:30:42,780
I know, we're...

19214
16:30:42,780 --> 16:30:45,820
I know you guys are gonna get mad if I keep going.

19215
16:30:45,960 --> 16:30:47,000
I know!

19216
16:30:48,120 --> 16:30:50,970
I know you guys are gonna get mad if...

19217
16:30:51,620 --> 16:30:53,300
I keep going.

19218
16:30:53,820 --> 16:30:55,360
We're free now.

19219
16:30:55,740 --> 16:30:56,580
We're free.

19220
16:30:57,840 --> 16:30:58,880
I can't...

19221
16:30:58,880 --> 16:31:01,940
My chat is mad if I keep going.

19222
16:31:06,020 --> 16:31:06,800
Alright.

19223
16:31:06,800 --> 16:31:06,980
Alright.

19224
16:31:08,840 --> 16:31:10,180
GG's guys.

19225
16:31:10,900 --> 16:31:11,680
GG's.

19226
16:31:11,860 --> 16:31:12,780
What a journey.

19227
16:31:18,720 --> 16:31:21,300
I'll get one win without...

19228
16:31:21,300 --> 16:31:22,900
That's so fucked.

19229
16:31:23,460 --> 16:31:24,100
Hey guys.

19230
16:31:24,660 --> 16:31:25,800
What a...

19231
16:31:26,920 --> 16:31:29,100
What a journey.

19232
16:31:29,860 --> 16:31:32,800
Those were some really fucked up games that I had.

19233
16:31:33,500 --> 16:31:35,380
But, thank you all for watching.

19234
16:31:35,380 --> 16:31:37,300
If you guys are new here, my name is DokiVid.

19235
16:31:37,380 --> 16:31:39,220
I usually stream on YouTube, but...

19236
16:31:39,220 --> 16:31:41,380
It's been a fucked up tight week.

19237
16:31:41,540 --> 16:31:45,380
It's been a fucked up week on Twitch.

19238
16:31:46,240 --> 16:31:48,740
I hope I do end top 500.

19239
16:31:49,420 --> 16:31:50,480
I hope.

19240
16:31:50,720 --> 16:31:54,120
Anyway, feel free to please subscribe to me on YouTube, because I usually stream there.

19241
16:31:54,940 --> 16:31:57,480
I mean, it will be normalized in four days.

19242
16:31:57,600 --> 16:31:58,540
I will start streaming there.

19243
16:31:58,900 --> 16:32:00,800
I'll be back to normal in four days.

19244
16:32:01,400 --> 16:32:05,720
Please follow me on Twitter, because I usually tweet out whenever I'm streaming on Twitch.

19245
16:32:05,880 --> 16:32:06,580
Is there anything else?

16:32:07,160 --> 16:32:08,400

All that stuff.

19249
16:32:11,240 --> 16:32:13,980
I don't know what else to show right now.

19250
16:32:17,640 --> 16:32:18,820

Nendoroid.

19253
16:32:24,300 --> 16:32:25,700
Yes, I have my very own Nendoroid.

19254
16:32:25,940 --> 16:32:26,420
Gamersubs.

19255
16:32:26,500 --> 16:32:27,100
Hi it.

19256
16:32:27,620 --> 16:32:28,360
All that stuff.

19257
16:32:28,460 --> 16:32:29,780
Check all of that out.

19258
16:32:29,780 --> 16:32:30,760
Hey guys.

19259
16:32:30,940 --> 16:32:31,820
Thank you all for watching.

19260
16:32:31,940 --> 16:32:32,760
It's been a while, right?

19261
16:32:32,840 --> 16:32:34,440
We were number one on Marble Rivals.

19262
16:32:35,220 --> 16:32:36,700
We were number one.

19263
16:32:37,140 --> 16:32:38,280
I'm so crazy.

19264
16:32:38,840 --> 16:32:40,860
I didn't expect myself to be number one.

19265
16:32:42,620 --> 16:32:43,340
But anyway.

19266
16:32:44,240 --> 16:32:45,200
Don't pitch intense.

19267
16:32:45,400 --> 16:32:50,000
There will not be a Marble Rivals stream today, because I streamed for 16 hours.

19268
16:32:50,560 --> 16:32:52,400
So anyway guys, as always, everybody stay hydrated.

19269
16:32:52,560 --> 16:32:52,960
Posture check.

19270
16:32:53,060 --> 16:32:53,540
Get up and move around.

19271
16:32:53,600 --> 16:32:54,220
Get that blood flowing.

19272
16:32:54,340 --> 16:32:57,100
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

19273
16:32:57,200 --> 16:32:58,520
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

19274
16:32:58,520 --> 16:32:59,460
Bye guys.

19275
16:32:59,620 --> 16:33:00,160
Bye.
