00:03:26,740 --> 00:04:19,160
hello everybody hello hello i am awake guys just so you guys know i did wake up a couple of hours early because um um i went into a food coma last night so uh but yes okay before i go into my food coma story let me just say uh we are oh sorry i just got uh i'm like my brain is like all over the place because i did have a little bit of caffeine right now so my attention span might not be the very highest right now and i just got a notification from the sound team on whether or not they're here today so i was like oh message so um i can get sort of a little obvious that i did have some caffeine i had some uh gamer subs today because uh i woke up a little early and by a little early i may or may not have woken up at six in the morning uh

2
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,160
just a little early.

3
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,520
And then I was like, do I stay up?

4
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,700
And I'm like, maybe I should stay up.

5
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,520
You know what?

6
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,300
Maybe I should stay up a little.

7
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,820
And if I feel a little tired, then I'll have some gamer subs.

8
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,300
And by the way, did you guys know I have a gamer sub code?

9
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,660
And if you use the code Doki Bird, you can get like, I don't know, some percentage off.

10
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,420
I don't even remember.

11
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,240
I have so many codes.

12
00:04:52,820 --> 00:06:21,740
getting harder to remember what the codes are and what percentage it is hashtag ad anyway so i am i got a little bit into a food coma because um i wanted to have a hot pot last night um and you'll be like wow dokey having hot pot all by yourself no no no okay so if you guys didn't know there's some hot pot places where you get your very own pot like so for those who are alone and have no friends this is the place for you um so yeah so they give you like their very own pot um and it's like not a giant ass pot and then like but then you're like oh but doki what about like the the the toppings like the the meat selection all that shit don't won't you can't even like order a lot of it because you can't eat all of it by yourself well jokes on you because they thought of that too uh for us for those who just really want to eat hot pot but like they have to eat alone okay uh so they have this special there's this like there's like there's like a lot of these there's a lot of hot pot places

13
00:06:21,740 --> 00:07:32,400
like this now because they're like wait some people actually want to just eat hot pot and like they may or may not have not have friends but it's not because they don't have friends is that maybe they just want to eat alone like can so can we just not want to eat alone like like we don't want to do any socialization and we just want to go there get some good ass food talk to nobody and then watch tea like watch your fucking show on your phone prop your phone up against like your bottle of water and just watch some show while you're eating hot pot can i just not have that anyway uh anyway um so there is some places um where they're like wow there is like an audience for that you know they're they're they're like customers that you know want to eat hot pot but they just want to eat alone so there's these hot pot places where you get your own pot and then there's like there's like like they put up all these toppings and meat selection and veggies um in like this aisle so like you know

14
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,620
like like a salad bar it's a hot pot bar

15
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,980
blaming me.

16
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,400
Like, I know there's some of you guys who have the same thoughts as me.

17
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,200
It was like, thank God I can eat by myself.

18
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,740
Okay, anyway, I can eat hot pot by myself.

19
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,060
So it's like a little buffet selection, but for like hot pot, like toppings, you know.

20
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,040
So like they give you a pot, and then you just like, you know, you don't have to grab like, you know, they don't give you a whole giant plate of meat.

21
00:08:02,280 --> 00:09:11,360
You can be like, I'll take two pieces of lamb and then one piece of and like oh the noodles and everything and then you put it in your pot and then they give you like um but you're so defensive anyway um um and then um and then you just go to the cashier and they like they do it by weight so they charge it by weight so like how heavy your pot is which is really nice because like some of the some it's not buffet they charge your pot they they just do know you get like very expensive fucking toppings but it doesn't matter because they just charge it by weight um and then like and then like and then you can choose the broth you want so you know that's really good so you'd be like i want this broth and then you give you a number and they'll take it to you and so so you know it was my first time trying it because i was like wait it's like okay to be fair i um i did try it there was i i had a little bit of trauma a couple of years ago because i places uh but they didn't have the hot pot

22
00:09:11,360 --> 00:10:16,080
selection thing um they just gave you like at that time they had like like it was like a solo hot pot but like you couldn't really pick the toppings you wanted um and um I threw up like like after I came home so then I got a little trauma about eating a hot pot alone because I'm like oh did I just not cook it right like yeah and then you have to cook it yourself too like they use a miniature hot pot but then you have to cook it yourself so I had like a little bit of a trauma because I was like oh no like did I not do it correctly like like is it like when I'm by myself I just don't know how to do hot pot by myself like so so I I was like I was just like all right let's do this again but like I had a different restaurant um and this time you choose your toppings and then they cook everything for you which is also very nice too so you choose the toppings and then oh yeah i think i ate too much it could have been i ate too much i don't remember i just remember i told my friend i was gonna

23
00:10:16,080 --> 00:11:05,700
go to this place and then my friend was like um uh my friend was like oh you ate too much didn't you and i think i ate too much i must have like um put too much meat or something because i was like i have to finish it because the the one i went to a couple years ago I they didn't have to choose your topping shit so they gave me a lot for the solo thing now I'm remembering sorry I'm remembering my trauma now I'm digging through my trauma um but this time now I realized oh I can pick how much I want like this time like this time around I can actually pick how much meat I want and like I didn't pick any veggies I obviously because I because I'm a child um so I only got the the mushrooms the anoki mushrooms because that's the only veggies that's inside my body.

24
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,560
So, I don't know, I just don't like wet cabbage.

25
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,100
It just fucking tastes weird.

26
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,560
I don't know.

27
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,920
Me personally, it's just, I don't know.

28
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,560
Wet cabbage just tastes really weird.

29
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,220
I just can't handle that.

30
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,300
And then, you know, I just, you know, got everything and it was so good.

31
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,540
Oh my God.

32
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,500
And then they cook everything for you too.

33
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,500
So you know, you pick the toppings, you, you know, pay for the pot and then they cook everything for you.

34
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,540
And I was like, yum, yum.

35
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:57,060
Mama likey Sorry I have caffeine in my stomach right now I don't have any filters I'm tired But I'm like I just have adrenaline in my system I'm sad

36
00:12:00,400 --> 00:13:07,980
Just laughing Anyway So after that I went into a I went into a uh uh food coma right i know it's like unwise to you know go to sleep right after you ate food because of like um what's it called the the acid from your throat i know there's a word for it but i can't remember recall it on the top of my head um let's say citric acid but that's just lemon like what is it called when you have like the acid acid reflex yeah uh i don't know why it's like citric acid reflux yeah like so um that i was i luckily for some reason i guess my stomach was like super happy about the hot pot and it's like today we give you get one pass like you get a pass for today i am satisfied so um um so like i woke up and i didn't get acid reflux so Thank fucking God,

37
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,260
like, happy belly was just like, you get a pass for today.

38
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,720
So, yeah, that's why I woke up at, like, I guess, like 6 to 7 in the morning.

39
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,760
I did some bits of work.

40
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,600
That is just, that's been, like, sleeping next.

41
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,020
To be fair, it's also because he's not allowed in my room, because I haven't cleaned my room yet.

42
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,020
Because, like I said, what I did was when I got home, I should really fix that.

43
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,080
But, like, I've been so fucking busy ever since I came back.

44
00:13:36,740 --> 00:14:18,620
and so like for those who weren't uh for those who like uh weren't there like for my first stream back um basically what happened was like uh i left my bed with like my luggage stuff that i took out from when i was in went to the guanjo trip for arrivals and i just like put everything on my bed and then to like repack my suitcase and then when i got home um you know my bed was filled with stuff like like clothes um stuff i bought in guanjo um everything and what i did was i took my arm out and i did like the sweep to the floor because i was so tired i just wanted to sleep

45
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:33,000
my arms and then i just sweeped everything onto the floor and then i went to bed and it's sort of And also my suitcase is also just like there.

46
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,300
And then I haven't closed.

47
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,560
And I didn't close my suitcase.

48
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,940
So I was just like, there's no mud.

49
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,380
There's literally just like random junk.

50
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,480
Like not junk, but like, you know, souvenirs.

51
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,520
Souvenirs, clothes, all that stuff.

52
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,380
And then I haven't fixed it yet.

53
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,740
So, um, so, uh, look, it's just my bedroom right now.

54
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,420
Like I sort of, I cleaned everything.

55
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,460
It's just my, okay.

56
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,660
That's a lie.

57
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,340
I didn't clean everything else, but I cleaned a lot.

58
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Okay.

59
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,020
Um, anyway, so I even cleaned my keyboard.

60
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,720
Oh my gosh.

61
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,560
Oh, so, um, it was so bad.

62
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:18,440
Like, I want, you know, like, okay, I will let you guys know that I shed hair a lot.

63
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,440
And I think it's not helping when, you know, when you're more stressed out, the more hair you stress that you shed.

64
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,400
But also I have a lot of hair.

65
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,860
So, um, so when I was like, I'm going to finally clean my keyboard because I didn't clean it for a while.

66
00:15:29,880 --> 00:16:01,180
now um only because I kept thinking that um um I was gonna get the um the I was waiting for the second the second the version to wooden keyboard um so I was waiting for that and I was waiting oh my gosh I hope my hair is okay actually I don't even know I hope I hope my hair is like because I've been very stressed out like the last couple of months so I hope I'm not I'm not fucking up my hair.

67
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,260
Anyway, you know, obviously, if you had never clean your keyboard, by the way, you should clean your keyboard.

68
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,220
Don't do what I did.

69
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,220
It was so fucking bad.

70
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,960
You know, I took the key caps off, and then I rinsed it in a bowl.

71
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,220
And then there was a lot of hair underneath the key caps.

72
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,500
And I was just like, how did all this hair get there?

73
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,180
I was like, it was so disgusting.

74
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,860
I was like, how did all that hair get into my keyboard?

75
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,440
I it was it was really fucked up.

76
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,200
So but clean your keyboard don't do what I do just be it on that.

77
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:47,120
So, um, um, it was really bad it was really bad like you have to clean you also have to clean your keycaps, um, like in a bowl of water with soap and everything.

78
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:57,020
I had like soak in there for a while before I, um, before I had to, um, to like, you know, dry it and everything.

79
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:29,080
so yeah and then i cleaned the board itself um so yeah no you you should and i even bought the little slime thing where you used to um where you used you know the slime thing and so i used some of that and also like getting a q-tip with alcohol all that fucking shit you know how you normally clean a keyboard um but it was a whole hour plus adventure that's no it was it was a Life's no it was not a waste of money.

80
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,760
That's how bad the keyboard was.

81
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:38,040
It was it was absolutely It was I thank God that yeah, it was a deep deep clean.

82
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:45,980
No, I had to use the slime to start the clean Because there was no way I was gonna start the clean with the q-tips.

83
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,740
It was that bad.

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,130
Thank you.

126
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,630
Thank you.

127
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:47,990
All right.

128
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,310
Anyway, guys.

129
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:49,630
All right.

130
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,470
Now onto the dokey jam.

131
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:51,870
Sorry.

132
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,810
I had to have my daily rant of the day to stay.

133
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,510
as a human be as a real human being

134
00:23:04,610 --> 00:24:12,130
anyway um so the joki jam i'm sorry i took a long time to uh announce the winners for the joki jam or do another joki jam stream i didn't want to like half ass the part two of the stream i know we had technically it's part three but part two the last one did not really count um because we pivoted very hard to something else um but uh i didn't want to like have acid because i wanted to you know have the time to play the games and everything um and my schedule was incredibly packed it was like the last couple of weeks you know i was all over the place i was traveling a lot i also took like a little break and stuff because i was like a little really burnt out and everything so i didn't want to like you know and then there were like i think like two to three weeks where i didn't really have a schedule so i wanted the dokey jam to be like scheduled and everything um um um so that people can like you know be like oh she's gonna do that stream i gotta make sure i'll be there if you're like

135
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:28,210
one of the devs and or something and um so that's why i took a while um i do want to do like a little disclaimer um um majority that word picked was done through a judge panel.

136
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:44,130
So I didn't pick these winners for some of them, only because I felt like it wasn't fair due to my biases, because I wasn't able to play all the games.

137
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,670
So I felt like it's not fair for me to personally pick a winner, just because I didn't play all the games.

138
00:24:50,030 --> 00:25:56,770
And what if this one game that I didn't play might have been a better game that um that might have should have been placed higher or something so so this was picked some of the winners were picked by a judge panel um that played all the games and like had they're all like like you know they all talked and been like gave feedback on like which they feel like uh that's why it's also take a little took a little bit of time because there were 238 entries so there was a judge panel that uh picked uh um that helped picked the finalist um just because like i said i felt like there would be a bias with me picking it um only because like i said i didn't get to play all the games um so some of these winners um i would be playing them on stream as well like uh experiencing the game um with you guys uh for to be like oh these are the reasons why the judge panel um um yeah they from what i'm told they played all the games to make their decision so and they also wrote a little summary as to why it

139
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:21,430
was picked and everything for me um so yeah uh so it was very hard to decide how to pick the winners so um we had like a little back and forth because you know um you dragoons also had your own pick for what you guys think should have been the top 10 of the games.

140
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:28,430
And obviously, you know, a lot of you guys play these games and a lot of you guys voted on it as well.

141
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,790
But then we also were thinking, like, what about like some games?

142
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,010
Maybe they deserve a higher rating, like from us personally and the judges personally.

143
00:26:38,550 --> 00:27:34,250
So, and we did think like, oh, yeah, maybe we should give Chad to some of the games that might not have been top 10 but we felt like where we felt like because of like you made me they didn't get a lot of people rating it or like not a lot of people played that game because it was an average of the the score it was based on the average of ratings so maybe they had a lot of people playing it and the average of the rating brought it down because there's so many different opinions and stuff like that so um that we had to take a lot of that into account because obviously like I said like some games had like like 70 ratings um some had 30 and then some of the games was like a lot of ratings their average got brought down a lot more so we took into that account as well and that's why it was very difficult because um um so yeah Like I said,

144
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,190
some games just didn't have enough ratings.

145
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,970
Or some games just had a lot of ratings.

146
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,150
And so we had to figure out how to balance that.

147
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:52,550
So there was a lot of back and forth with me and the team or the head project leader on how to do this.

148
00:27:53,210 --> 00:28:10,670
So basically, after a lot of discussion, we decided that also before I begin, the prize pool, have six, we, six people will get prizes in terms of like, uh, it'll be top six.

149
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:17,750
Um, and, uh, it's like first place is $2,000, I believe.

150
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,810
Let me look at back.

151
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,470
Let me look back.

152
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,370
It is first place gets $2,000.

153
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,870
Second place gets a thousand.

154
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,190
Third place gets 500.

155
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,810
And then third, fourth, fifth, and

156
00:28:33,830 --> 00:29:45,230
each team gets 500 and it's split between the teams um itself so it's not like each person gets a thousand like 2000 it's the entire team will get two thousand dollars um so like that's how the prize money is split and everyone that participates gets a participation prize so the sum of the devs have i know like some devs have opted out of the physical participation prize um there are two physical participation prize i'll show it on screen for those who forgot about them because before but i believe you get a um a postcard which is this this would be the postcard um and because like you know some devs didn't want to uh give their address which is understandable because of privacy you know and then also a little sticker so um so every developer that participated um gets these bonus items as a participation prize like you might not have won but you get a little like a momento for uh being part of the dokey jam so they get the little sticker and the postcard um some people opted out and

157
00:29:45,230 --> 00:30:33,290
they just they would get like a uh they would also get a uh for those who opted out of the participation prize physical prizes uh we give them like a little coupon code at the uh at the dokey merch store so we also have uh that as well um so there that is uh the participation prize so anyway the winners it was very hard choice and how like i said to structure um to how we do the winners but like we talked and then some of the judges agreed that you know um they sort of deserve the placements for this so um we decided that All right,

158
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,050
let me show this real quick.

159
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:46,910
We decided that first, second, and third will be the official first, second, and third placements.

160
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,830
And I did play these three games and they were all very well done.

161
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,550
So, yay!

162
00:30:53,190 --> 00:31:02,050
So congratulations to the Dokey Break Time Terminal devs, the one bullet.

163
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:09,290
devs and the Tamadoki devs for winning first, second, and third place.

164
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:09,930
Yay!

165
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:12,650
Congratulations!

166
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,550
Yay!

167
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:30,370
So yes, we had a long discussion because like, you know, do we get, do we get choose new winners for first, second, third, or do we go with the ratings, the overall ratings that you guys picked?

168
00:31:30,870 --> 00:32:45,830
And, you know, like I said, the judges played all the games and they all agree that first second third um should go to them um um and that you know uh um they agreed with the placement now for fourth fifth and six as i don't want to say like you know i don't want me guys to feel bad because there are like you know games that did were fourth fifth and six but um we talked for a while like i said this was very hard it was very hard because you know i wish i could have included more winners i really did um but we wanted to give a little spotlight to some games that they felt um should also deserve like recognition so i will like give a shout out to the 456 that you guys voted so there's uh dokey's flock and roll adventure the save the main and um the dokey boom dash i want to give a shout out to you guys because you guys did make um four fifth and six through the um through the user votes um but like I said the judges and I we talked and um we thought that we should highlight um the other

169
00:32:45,830 --> 00:34:00,810
uh some other games that might not have made a top 10 or we're in top 10 but we're not like you know first second third um um that we want to give a highlight to and uh and like you know they played all the games um to make this judgment and um and i want to say uh i trust them in the judgment and like i said i didn't i personally didn't pick four fifth and six only because like i said i didn't have the time to play 238 games so i felt like it wasn't my place to pick the games as some because i would have biases so i will be playing for the fourth fifth and sixth place with you guys um and also I wanted to experience like playing the games live as well so like on stream as well and like showcasing it on stream like blind too so I wanted to have that opportunity as well so anyway for fourth place uh let me look over the sheet that they gave me um we have like a little this like a little summary of why it was chosen and everything so let me look through that the right one so i believe it

170
00:34:00,810 --> 00:35:17,970
is it where is it all right so well and i'll go with sixth place first let me see i can find it where is sixth place all right in sixth place i know that you know we're it's for second third there's so many good games it was such a hard pick um there's you guys talented um I I really I'm so thankful to have such an amazing fan base um and such talented like fans like you guys are so talented like game programming and it's like a jam too a game jam so yes you guys had to do it all within a fucking deadline too so like you know programming art music um I guess sound effects and everything is just crazy that you guys were able to do all that like as well um do it all within like two weeks as well so i really appreciate you guys give yourself a little round of applause yippee i would love to host more of these like events for you guys showcase all your talents and everything because like you know you guys are all so talented as well and uh you guys all like united under this talent unlike

171
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:31,870
um in support of me so yippee um anyway Um, in sixth place, um, the judges have picked Doki Pop Fever.

172
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,470
I was like, Thedier.

173
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:42,330
So, huge congratulations to Doki Pop Fever for getting sixth place.

174
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,250
Um, let's see.

175
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,510
Uh, let's see what they wrote for the judges wrote.

176
00:35:48,730 --> 00:36:00,430
So, the reason they picked Doki Pop Fever for sixth place is that they think that this game takes the fruit-fruit-combiner genre and puts an entirely new spin on it.

177
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,210
So the gems theme is more than represented and has quite a good polish.

178
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:19,330
So the main reason is why the judges picked this game to be mentioned to be sixth place is because they felt like the theme was chain reactions and they felt like this game highlighted the theme very, very well.

179
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:48,190
So it does um so uh that is why um it was picked uh so yeah i'm super excited to try this game out uh like later on when after i announced the other two winners in fifth place let me let me grab make sure i'm showcasing the correct one in fifth place also need to make sure that

180
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,290
I am showing the correct one.

181
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,330
It's not the fourth place one that I'm showing.

182
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,730
And I'm saying the correct name.

183
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,730
It is Sulfur and Feathers.

184
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,430
Oh, this is like a 3D game too.

185
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:19,770
So the reason why the judges picked this one in fifth place is because it perfectly embodies the chaotic nature of chain reactions and dragoons.

186
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:26,690
The game has a decent playtime for a relatively short development period and really shines through overall game view.

187
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,410
So here are some of the devs that have worked on this.

188
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:41,650
There is Junot, Lestie, Pikachu, and Dr. Danez that worked on sulfur and feathers.

189
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,870
Also, I believe Alan worked on the game that was sixth place.

190
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,950
There's no BGM because I just realized that.

191
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,630
We'll have BGM later when we play the games, guys.

192
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,150
Yay, congratulations.

193
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:05,370
Also, by the way, my sound team was like, we can only be there for the first hour, and I have yet to play any of the games, so I'm sorry.

194
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:11,890
The red was, the hot pot red was very important.

195
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,570
But yes, we will be playing this later on as well.

196
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,750
Anyway, so we might have to promote one of the regular.

197
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:51,210
mods to be temporary sound guy after that hour is gone um anyway so congratulations to the developers work uh sulfur and feathers um i don't know volume is pretty um all right finally in fourth place we have uh drum roll please in the fourth place We have,

198
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,930
okay, you guys can't see the title, but I can't fix this because I'm trying.

199
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,930
It's called Document Save the Golden Dragoon.

200
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:07,110
So you guys can see here is, here are the graphics of that game.

201
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:18,130
So the reason why the judges picked this game as fourth place, it is a Mario Maker type game that amazed us with how fast but coherent it was put together.

202
00:39:19,770 --> 00:40:27,870
reactions theme perfectly and was an overall joy to play through while it didn't have a grand noise story it made up for it in creativity and interpreting the themes jams theme in its own way um so yes all the judges did look into like each criteria as well so and they wanted to focus on the theming of it um during like the judging period so i'm really looking forward to playing this game as well um the judges love the chain reactions i mean it was the theme of the game jam so um it does make sense that they were looking at how create how people interpret um interpret the uh the game like interpret that into their game design um so yes huge congratulations like i said to all the winners i'm really sorry that we couldn't pick more winners but i will definitely host more game jams in the future because it was very fun maybe i'll ask if maybe we'll collab with other vtubers and hosting a game jam too um but thank you all for uh thank you to all the devs um for participating thank you to

203
00:40:27,870 --> 00:41:14,250

You can also quickly left click to pop them without connecting You can chain any dokey pop to the tomato in the middle Allowing to reach dokey pops to the other side dokey pops that change together will grow in size Once they reach 10 they'll pop on their own after one second So it's like be jeweled with swika When you you don't need to read the top it literally just says dokey pop fever mechanics just see we just need to look at the bottom

250
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,330
When you pop Doki Pops, nearby pieces will grow in size.

251
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,990
Doki Pops grown in this way can also be popped on their own.

252
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,010
Potentially triggering a chain reaction of pops.

253
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:30,790
Both you and your opponents have a red HP bar and a yellow SP bar.

254
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:35,810
Pop Doki Pops to keep your HP up and fill up your SP.

255
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:37,790
What does the SP do?

256
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,930
Opponent HP will go down when we pop Doki Pops and their SP bar will be filled over time.

257
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,130
When their SP bar is filled, their skill will act always.

258
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,270
It's my skill points.

259
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,050
It's my skill points.

260
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,010
To avoid being overwhelmed.

261
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,350
Press space bar to activate Doki's skill.

262
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,710
Throwing a Doki blade.

263
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,970
Oh, it's the Doki blade across the board.

264
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,210
Also, by the way, the ending screen is going to be different.

265
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,090
Across the board to increase the size.

266
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:03,130
So, you got to stay.

267
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,690
You got to stay for the ending screen.

268
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,470
For something special.

269
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,730
The path the night goes will follow your...

270
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,270
Also, it'll follow my cursor.

271
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,110
Increase the size.

272
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,390
The Doki Blade will also destroy enemy skill Doki Pops.

273
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,210
Try using your skill to take care of those pesky pieces on your board.

274
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:22,570
Okay.

275
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,310
I figured it out.

276
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,220
Hello.

277
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,900
Where are they called when they're like...

278
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,220
Oh!

279
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,380
Wait, the BGM!

280
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,360
Wait, what is this?

281
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,040
Oh!

282
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,120
Fast.

283
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:38,400
Alright.

284
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,760
Okay, we got our music in.

285
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:43,740
Step, step.

286
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,760
It's the wizard.

287
00:45:47,520 --> 00:46:50,310

288
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:51,250
I'm ready.

289
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,060
All right.

290
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,840
Does he, like, do it after me?

291
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,780
Is he gonna pop?

292
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:03,680
Oh, my God.

293
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,320
Oh, my God.

294
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,700
I can't hesitate.

295
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,700
Can I pop his stuff?

296
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:08,940
Oh, my God.

297
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,800
I don't know if me popping his stuff was the right idea.

298
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,080
I'm gonna do it.

299
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,940
Okay, maybe I shouldn't have done it.

300
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:16,260
Okay.

301
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,160
That's okay.

302
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,520
That's okay.

303
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,220
All right.

304
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:38,100
Maybe I don't know I'm like thinking was that a good idea like I'm just helping him like Oh my god, don't do well under pressure.

305
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,560
Don't you don't do well under pressure.

306
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:42,540
Okay.

307
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,240
There you go.

308
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,180
Oh Where is where is more pops?

311
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,060
It's just...

312
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,560
It's just a little game theory.

313
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,000
Okay.

314
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,040
Alright.

315
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,300
There we go.

316
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,040
That's a lot of pops that I did.

317
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,220
Did it help me?

318
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,340
I did a lot.

319
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,200
Did it help me?

320
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,800
Oh, well, I don't know.

321
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,600
I guess we'll find out.

322
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,520
Okay.

323
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:37,600
Oh my god, stop, stop popping No I'll just keep popping I'm still alive I don't know how I'm still

324
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:55,440
Okay, I figured it out I figured out how to play this game I figured, I just realized I didn't pop My bubbles When the whole idea is that I gotta pop it.

325
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,800
I realized that that might have been like, oh my God, he popped my bubbles again.

326
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:02,940
He keeps doing it.

327
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,660
I don't know how he keeps doing it.

328
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,420
Like, okay.

329
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:15,040
Now I realize I was missing one important feature.

330
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,080
And that was, I had to pop that balloon.

331
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,680
But I wasn't popping it.

332
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:47,760
that's a little awkward i was just making bubbles for him to pop there you go see guys i figured how to play this game i figured it out it only took me losing the tutorial one very important detail all right it's just a little oopsie you know okay i got my knife i'm so glad we lowered the difficulty

333
00:51:51,540 --> 00:52:00,420
process it but i did it i figured it out all right pop um pop

334
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:20,920
all right oh he popped that oh all right there you go see guys i'm winning now i just forgot like one very key idea about popping i had to pop which i sort of forgot to do It was a very important detail, apparently, in this game.

335
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,700
You could say that it might be, like, the whole premise of Doki Pop.

336
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,380
Uh-oh.

337
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,720
I just kept connecting things instead.

338
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,720
Who would have thought?

339
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,900
Oh, so that's why he was winning.

340
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:38,840
He just kept...

341
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,660
He was just popping my things.

342
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,220
Alright.

343
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,240
Pop, pop.

344
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:44,760
Pop.

345
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,580
That's right, it's over for you, Grand Wizard.

346
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:52,380
Pop!

347
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,480
Alright, then.

348
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,100
Keep popping.

349
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,320
We never stop.

350
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,180
Pop, pop!

351
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,920
Like my favorite community member says.

352
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,140
Pop, pop!

353
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,800
Hope he's okay.

354
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,540
Still haven't got our movie yet.

355
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,900
I hope he'll be in the movie.

356
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:13,660
Alright.

357
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,720
This way.

358
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,540
And then...

359
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,180
How is he still not dead yet?

360
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,700
At least he should have died from old age at this point.

361
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,320
With how long it's taking me to play this game?

362
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,480
Like...

363
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,900
He's a one-man pie true.

364
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,780
Look at him!

365
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,360
He can't even open his eyes anymore!

366
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,840
Like, someone, take him to a home!

367
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:49,940
Yeah.

368
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:51,460
Oh, my God.

369
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,120
Big Minto.

370
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,240
There you go.

371
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,600
Dry ass mint.

372
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,860
Okay, this is where he dies.

373
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,680
I'm going to use my special skill.

374
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,440
No mercy.

375
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,380
No mercy.

376
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,200
That's right.

377
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,000
I didn't have to use my skill.

378
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,700
But I want the real victory.

379
00:54:14,700 --> 00:55:41,600

not Doki Land.

381
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,920
Like, we are not affiliated with Doki Land.

382
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,260
You're one of the few to endure the trials.

383
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,960
But the road has not ended.

384
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,760
Young Master, I simply request you to commit.

385
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,800
Of course I'll come.

386
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,260
Wow, that's a good one.

387
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,200
Looks like you've learned something too.

388
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,680
I suppose so, young Master.

389
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,460
I have learned a thing or two as well.

390
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,420
Yeah, not bad for an old bird.

391
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,980
My sincerest thanks.

392
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,400
I'm glad to have lightened the moon now.

393
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,940
Wait, are you going to die?

394
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,480
Leave to where?

395
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,600
The land of my ancestors.

396
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,040
To the land I was born.

397
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,380
I am old, young master.

398
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,680
I wish you to rest close to those who have raised me.

399
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,120
Oh my god, he's got a Kung Fu Panda, this shit.

400
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,180
I've called to set you on your next journey, but also to bid you farewell.

401
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,400
So, I won't be able to meet you anymore?

402
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,380
Who am I to decide fate, young master?

403
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,140
We may, or we may not.

404
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,380
Life works in mysterious ways.

405
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,280
People come and go as unfortunately as it is.

406
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:14,680
There is a meaning to what you feel, and therefore, it is important.

407
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:47,160
but we may let myself give you one last lesson I want you to use donkey pop to connect to connect people young master to connect people yuck yes to connect to give a part of you as a gift to another for me I have shared my knowledge with you that is is all I have to say.

408
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,080
Once again, congratulations.

409
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,160
Oh, he just gave me a strand of his hair.

410
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,700
Is that, like...

411
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,220
Freak behavior?

412
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,940
He said technically he gave a strand of his hair in me.

413
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,380
Using Jokie Pop to connect?

414
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,680
But Jokie Pop to connect.

415
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:25,120
is about beating the enemy a weapon to connect huh you're funny old bird dead wait you can you can talk

416
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:45,360
hey doky i want us wondering if you need some help with the doky pop Championship.

417
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,980
What do I just don't even understand?

418
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,820
It's like the whole Stewie situation.

419
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,140
Like does does she actually understand what he's saying?

420
00:58:52,780 --> 00:59:02,600
Like he's just like like he thinks he's talking but he's like oh my wow wow wow I know a person that can help you get better.

421
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,620
I think you said something about tribe and the local hero.

422
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:08,140
Ducky.

423
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,020
Oh yeah I knew it.

424
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,340
Oh dad.

425
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,900
I knew it.

426
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,880
I was like, why the fuck?

427
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,980
You can fucking talk?

428
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,580
Too tight.

429
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,560
Were you up to dead?

430
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,700
Oh, right.

431
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:32,340
I know a person that can help you in your dokey pop championship.

432
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,860
I'm sure you'll win it with help for... Oh, ring, ring, ring, ring.

433
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,140
Oh, shoot.

434
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,340
I forgot to attend this meeting.

435
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,220
Sorry, Dad.

436
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,240
Talk to you later.

437
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,060
Goodbye.

438
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:43,940
Good.

439
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,440
Goodbye?

440
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,980
Wolf, wolf, translation, no, wolf means kick-kaku.

441
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,280
I'll get it one day.

442
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,320
I'll get it.

443
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,920
Just watch me, Doki.

444
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:00,740
Oh, wait.

445
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,320
Am I fighting her next?

446
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:03,980
All right.

447
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,940
Surely our two half brain cells can get in.

448
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,300
We'll have the match of the century.

449
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,640
Can't believe I got distracted.

450
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,200
That old.

451
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,760
bird that I missed my meaning.

452
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,260
prepare yourself.

453
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,660
I'm here to fight you.

454
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:24,760
Alright.

455
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:25,920
Pop, pop.

456
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,680
Mint skill spawns in whips that make Joki pops around them.

457
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,080
Mint Joki pops are unaffected by this.

458
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,900
Make big Joki pops near the whips to destroy them.

459
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,660
Try saving Mint Joki... Mint Joki pops to take care of the whips.

460
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,100
Mint skill spawns in whips that makes... Okay, wait, that's her skill.

461
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:42,460
Alright.

462
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,880
Alright, we got this.

463
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,620
We can beat her.

464
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,480
We have the same size brain cell.

465
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,120
She can't be smarter than me.

466
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,100
Alright.

467
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:54,800
Okay.

468
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,060
Oops, I forgot to pop this.

469
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:57,780
That's right.

470
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,380
Can't pop mine.

471
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,540
I'll pop this net first.

472
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,360
I'll save.

473
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,100
Oh my gosh.

474
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,380
I forgot I can't save them.

475
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,600
Because, like, she'll just...

476
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,020
She'll just pop it.

477
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,600
That's fine.

478
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,800
I'll pop yours first.

479
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,620
What you're gonna do when I pop it first?

480
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,580
Oh, okay.

481
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:23,840
Pop this.

482
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,660
And now I got rid of...

483
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,240
That's right!

484
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,640
Good body or whisk!

485
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,060
We're dead now!

486
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,240
They're double dead!

487
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:33,180
Uh...

488
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,260
Alright, I got this.

489
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,460
And now pop that.

490
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,140
And then...

491
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,800
Oh god, they made it.

492
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:46,340
Tiny.

493
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,300
Oh my god.

494
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,420
We're evenly matched.

495
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,420
Because we're both stupid as hell, I guess.

496
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,200
We're evenly matched, everyone.

497
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,220
Oh god.

498
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,860
I gotta keep popping these.

499
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:05,660
Alright.

500
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,920
You can pop this.

501
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,520
Wait, that wizard didn't die?

502
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,360
Oh my god.

503
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,560
I thought it would die.

504
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,140
Oh my god, they're so tiny.

505
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,340
Wow.

506
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,040
Okay, I'm winning currently.

507
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,520
I think I am.

508
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,800
No hesitation.

509
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,740
Oh my god, she's spawning so many of them too.

510
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:34,120
Um.

511
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:35,800
Fuck.

512
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,080
Trying to...

513
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,920
Oh my god, there's so many.

514
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,320
Oh, they're so tiny!

515
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,000
She made them so tiny!

516
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:44,980
Oh!

517
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,700
Oh my god, it just keeps shrinking.

518
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,340
I'm thinking.

519
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,280
Oh my god, why does my HP keep going down?

520
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,140
There's nothing to pop.

521
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,220
It's actually...

522
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,680
There's nothing to pop.

523
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,760
Okay.

524
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,320
There we go.

525
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,200
Uh...

526
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,820
Okay, I have a knife.

527
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,400
The brains that went to her.

528
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,240
Okay.

529
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,140
Oh my god, that barely did anything.

530
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,880
That's how fucked up it is right now.

531
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,440
Oh my god.

532
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,040
She's just...

533
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,580
She just keeps sending more!

534
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:47,990
Okay.

535
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:50,310
Oh my god.

536
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:59,750
There's too many!

537
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,970
We have a problem!

538
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:05,850
Okay.

539
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:07,970
Oh, this is bad.

540
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,430
This is bad.

541
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:14,210
This is so bad.

542
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,630
No, why did it pop that?

543
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:19,210
I needed this to save my life!

544
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:24,110
Oh my god.

545
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:25,330
It's not fair.

546
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:26,050
Please nerf.

547
01:04:27,030 --> 01:05:03,550

548
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:04,630
We got...

549
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,230
I had Nerfer again!

550
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:13,510
I demand a double nerf.

551
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,510
Oh, my God.

552
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:19,830
I said, like, does she pop it herself?

553
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,570
Alright, it's not fair.

554
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:25,930
She's too strong.

555
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:59,510

She took my path.

557
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,330
That was I set it up.

558
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:03,750
I set that up.

559
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:16,190
Okay All right Oh, I wanted to That was my setup I set that up fair and square

I'm just going to pop this and then do that and then pop that.

563
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,260
And then there you go.

564
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:13,740
There.

565
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,060
There we go.

566
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:24,950
Oh my god, I was going to say I swear to you guys, if that, like, turned into a tiny.

567
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:27,690
I got a lock in.

568
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:30,870
There we go.

569
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:31,850
That got rid of three.

570
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:32,370
See, look at that.

571
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,750
I'm popping.

572
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:36,290
We're popping.

573
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,590
You know how to pop.

574
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,010
It's over.

575
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,170
It's over for her.

576
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:48,290
We're figuring it out.

577
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:54,470
And then...

578
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:56,410
Get rid of this, though.

579
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:58,750
Are you serious?

580
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:00,530
Okay, we gotta use the knife.

581
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:01,390
My turn!

582
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:03,710
Oh my god.

583
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:07,350
That's not what I wanted, but okay.

584
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:08,010
Oh,

585
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,230
that doesn't get rid of it.

586
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:12,530
It's fine.

587
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,150
I got this.

588
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:14,510
All right.

589
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:17,270
It's fine.

590
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:18,330
I got this, too.

591
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:21,450
And now pop that before you pop me.

592
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:22,750
Now do that.

593
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:24,530
And then that didn't pop it.

594
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:25,590
Okay.

595
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:26,370
That's fine.

596
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:26,970
We don't care.

597
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:30,750
That should have popped it, though.

598
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,750
That 100% should have popped it.

599
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,810
Oh my gosh, she's hanging by the thread, and she knows.

600
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:37,650
What?

601
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:39,570
Okay.

602
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,750
That should have my pop.

603
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:45,510
Oh my god.

604
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,030
Okay, that's fine.

605
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:50,570
You don't need it.

606
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:53,930
Okay, uh...

607
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:55,570
There you go.

608
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:57,310
It's fine.

609
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:58,910
I took her pops.

610
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,450
She does nothing without it.

611
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:04,190
Okay.

612
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:19,480

614
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:43,080
I want the Doki patch where I can have her ability.

615
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:45,440
Ah!

616
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:46,500
Yeah!

617
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,060
How'd you get so strong?

618
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,240
Why would I tell you?

619
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,320
That's not fair!

620
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:58,980
That's not fair.

621
01:09:59,080 --> 01:09:59,780
What's not fair?

622
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,080
Come on, as a friend, please!

623
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,220
Yeah, you know, next Doki patch.

624
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,680
She doesn't even deserve an ability.

625
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:13,620
Give her zero abilities.

626
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,980
And then, like, when I fight her, I use her ability.

627
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,440
Fine, fine.

628
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:23,880
The secret to how I get so good at it is...

629
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,120
It's because I commit.

630
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:28,660
Commit.

631
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:29,700
Commit what?

632
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,180
Commit my boss.

633
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:32,700
Whoa!

634
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,020
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

635
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,020
I'll remember that.

636
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:43,840
Keep your secret.

637
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,800
I'll find my own way.

638
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:49,500
Got him.

639
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:50,940
Good luck.

640
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,420
What's this?

641
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,600
What should I do now?

642
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,440
At this point, I'll lose again.

643
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:05,160
Looks like Omere gets a special ticket to your concert this year.

644
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:06,780
Dad!

645
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,880
Do you seek power?

646
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:11,900
Huh?

647
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,160
Do you seek power?

648
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:19,840
I can help you defeat her and get the ticket you desire.

649
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,260
You trade her!

650
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:22,840
What?

651
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,320
No, you weirdo.

652
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:26,620
Whatever.

653
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,440
This is my card.

654
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:30,660
If you truly want to become...

655
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,860
He's like Darth Vader or some shit.

656
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,020
He's like Emperor Papadine.

657
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:35,920
Do it.

658
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,980
You know who to call.

659
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:39,420
Ghostbusters!

660
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,880
Do it.

661
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:45,040
Alright.

662
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,260
No, absolutely not.

663
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,640
We're not going to Doki Pop Island.

664
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:51,540
What?

665
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,140
Why?

666
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,520
That place is dangerous!

667
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,560
Is that a challenge?

668
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,140
You're not really taking this seriously.

669
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,860
Doki Pop Island is guarded by the Doki Pop Golems.

670
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,260
You won't survive a single second out there.

671
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,700
Is that a challenge?

672
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,860
No, it's not.

673
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,100
You're going to die.

674
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,280
Oh, that is a challenge, all right.

675
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,780
Your mom is a challenge.

676
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:18,740
Oh, pew, pew.

677
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:21,980
All right.

678
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:28,100
Do B skill summons a train that would chug through the top or bottom corner of your boy.

679
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,140
Doggy pops that run over become smaller.

680
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,140
Example of a train running through the bottom corner.

681
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:34,900
Oh, my God.

682
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,280
She shrinks everything.

683
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,580
Wait, that's so OP.

684
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,620
Let's get a blade.

685
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:47,260
I should be able to, like, get stronger.

686
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,820
Like, every time I win, I should be able to get, like, stronger.

687
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,020
And to steal their abilities.

688
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,320
That should be, like, a thing.

689
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,460
Wait, she has her ability now?

690
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:07,700
Okay, that's okay.

691
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,020
that side, so that's fine.

692
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,020
I mean, that's fine.

693
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,640
I actually didn't expand it, too.

694
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:20,360
As long as we're okay.

695
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:21,660
Pop pop.

696
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,620
Oh, wait.

697
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,080
There's so many doobies here.

698
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:28,580
Oh my god, no.

699
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:30,420
Oh, thank god.

700
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:30,800
Okay.

701
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,500
Oh my god.

702
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:31,960
Thank god.

703
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:32,540
Okay.

704
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:37,680
I was gonna be like, no, I just filled a giant ass doobie.

705
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,600
A doobie like that.

706
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,480
That'd be so sad.

707
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,660
I literally just expanded my doobie too.

708
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:48,980
But it's okay, I got it.

709
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,460
Oh my gosh, she's gonna use that just as I.

710
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,400
Okay, I gotta get this guy out.

711
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,600
No, no, where is it?

712
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:56,400
Top or bottom?

713
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,800
Okay, oh my god, are you serious?

714
01:13:58,940 --> 01:13:59,600
Okay, that's fine.

715
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:01,180
I didn't need that.

716
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,940
I did not need it.

717
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:08,360
Okay, this is actually less harder than...

718
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,000
And actually, this is...

719
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,640
Okay, why was Mint's ability so goddamn strong?

720
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,460
Compared to, like, doobie.

721
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,780
Like, nerf her.

722
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,820
I demand another nerf.

723
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:21,760
I ought...

724
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:26,460
She is level 2.

725
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,300
Nerf her or give me her ability.

726
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,820
Doki has spoken.

727
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,500
She nerfed to the ground.

728
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,960
Nerf her so she becomes out of meta.

729
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,980
Get rid of the meta.

730
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,300
Let's see it.

731
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:55,600
All right.

732
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,440
Got the knife.

733
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,560
Only I can be.

734
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,160
Yeah, exactly.

735
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,560
Only I can be the most OP character.

736
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,880
It's literally my game.

737
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,360
Like...

738
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,700
Alright, where is that?

739
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:12,800
Wait, that's fine.

740
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,040
I just need it.

741
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,540
Alright, uh...

742
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,420
I am the title of the character.

743
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,360
Excuse me.

744
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,120
Uh...

745
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,760
So, technically, I should be allowed to be the strongest character.

746
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,220
The doki has spoken.

747
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,620
Alright, where is it?

748
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:35,240
If it's...

749
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:35,780
Oh, my God.

750
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,340
Of course, it's...

751
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:36,840
the top.

752
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,640
Oh my god, wait, it combined itself.

753
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,740
Wait, why did it combine?

754
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,520
I thought I was supposed to make it smaller.

755
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:48,930
Alright.

756
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,950
Okay, that was my pop.

757
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:57,030
Or unless like, did she pop or did I pop it?

758
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:01,070
I'm gonna get rid of these just in case.

759
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:03,850
Alright, that's fine.

760
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,670
There was nothing over on that side anyway.

761
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:08,290
So that worked out for me.

762
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:18,250
If I get rid of this, I can have more of the mints around this side.

763
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:20,750
Oh my god, this one is...

764
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,630
See, this level is so much easier.

765
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:27,600
Okay, nice.

766
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:28,920
The iframes, it worked.

767
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,440
And then grab all the small mints together.

768
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,220
And then we can combine all the big dokees together after that.

769
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,240
the dragon.

770
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,060
These look like they look like bread.

771
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,560
Or like, are they supposed to be slime?

772
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,480
I guess they're supposed to be slime.

773
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,100
Oh no, I just I just saw her.

774
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,840
We gotta do this fast.

775
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,260
It's okay, the eye frames.

776
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:53,340
Oh, it's okay.

777
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,060
It's at the top.

778
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,000
We got the eye frames.

779
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,240
Alright, nice.

780
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:01,360
Oops.

781
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,840
Now I'm gonna pop that.

782
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,220
I wonder what's done.

783
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,400
Alright, you dead now.

784
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:06,380
What?

785
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,260
You're still alive?

786
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,100
You're supposed to be dead now.

787
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,040
Or is it because is so my turn?

788
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:13,680
Please, Doki, she's dead!

789
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:14,680
No!

790
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,580
We don't stop!

791
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,460
Take me to Doki Pop Island!

792
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,180
Alright, there you go.

793
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,000
Nice.

794
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,240
Victory, no mercy.

795
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,420
I'm gonna...

796
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:41,880
I'm gonna ground... Well, How are my doki-pop skills?

797
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,040
Are you convinced?

798
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:44,560
Is Saikuno?

799
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:45,280
Oh.

800
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,080
Fine.

801
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,500
You really did improve since the last time we played doki-pop.

802
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:52,820
But don't blame me.

803
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,840
You can't handle doki-pop island.

804
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:58,100
Yeah, I just got a random invite from Saikuno for a game.

805
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:58,780
And I was like, what?

806
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,660
I don't even have this game on my Steam.

807
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:04,060
Like, relax.

808
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,080
But before you know it, the train will be filled with souvenirs.

809
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,480
Why do you even want to go so badly?

810
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,980
Why do I want to go?

811
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,820
Bruh, I'm sure you'll figure it out soon.

812
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:19,680
Of course I will.

813
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,560
I didn't receive like a Discord DM.

814
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,580
I just got a random seaman, but yeah.

815
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,520
It was just out of nowhere.

816
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:31,560
It was nice to invite me.

817
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,500
It just felt like it was just out of nowhere.

818
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,120
Thanks for the ride, Divi.

819
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,160
See you soon.

820
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:40,740
Good luck.

821
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,100
All right, now where was I?

822
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,420
Where are we going?

823
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:47,760
Temple is.

824
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:49,280
Oh, hey, Chibi.

825
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,620
It's my daughter.

826
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,360
I was going to say my son.

827
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,520
It's my daughter.

828
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:53,820
Chibi-Doki.

829
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,420
My son.

830
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,280
What the hell?

831
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,340
Is that a child?

832
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,680
Wait, Chibi, is that you?

833
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,840
It's my child.

834
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,240
Who's Chibi?

835
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,640
Why are you looking at me like that?

836
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,140
Is there something on my face?

837
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,560
Hey, don't leave me alone.

838
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:42,510
my god i'll be back i'm just gonna get some milk real quick her head is like two times the size of my head but yet it's so empty uh are we there yet nope are we there yet nope don't talk to me or my son yet again yes mostly uh like creature uh at least we know she floats you know Like,

839
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:48,770
if we chuck her in the water, she'll, like, the buoyancy of her head will allow her to be alive.

840
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:51,830
Two hours of exploring later.

841
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,330
God damn it.

842
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:58,230
Not this type of forest.

843
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:01,110
No, it's because her head is filled with air.

844
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:04,130
Are you there yet?

845
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:09,470
Hey, Chibi, what's that over there?

846
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:11,210
What?

847
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:11,690
What?

848
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,610
All right, now what should I do?

849
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,560
Joki, you bit...

850
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,820
I can't believe you've done this.

851
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,700
She's asleep, huh?

852
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,240
I don't think you'll mind if I sneak these into her pockets.

853
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,240
Ah!

854
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,700
Ah!

855
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,540
Oh, you're back.

856
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,440
Yes, I'm fucking back, asshole.

857
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,160
Language, Cheeby.

858
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,300
All right.

859
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,940
What are you even doing on this island?

860
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,120
To help.

861
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:00,700
Yes.

862
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,340
I'm a magical girl, duh.

863
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,520
I can manifest anywhere I want.

864
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,960
And you see me need the help from me.

865
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:08,400
Yep.

866
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,220
Oh, you're really helping me?

867
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,040
Thanks.

868
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:14,080
Yeah, I'm helping you.

869
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:15,440
Okay, then.

870
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,580
Lead the way.

871
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:20,020
Crap, I don't know what the hell to go either.

872
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:21,840
This wasn't an agreement.

873
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,200
Random direction it is.

874
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,700
This way.

875
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:31,830
Three hours later.

876
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:36,210
Out of all the directions, I lead her to the temple!

877
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,950
Hey, oh yeah, there's a lot, Chibi.

878
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:43,250
Okay, all I have to do is make sure she doesn't find...

879
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:44,130
I found a door!

880
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:45,350
Ah!

881
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:47,790
Oh, wait, stop!

882
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:50,110
Hey, what's wrong?

883
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:53,270
You can't go in.

884
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:55,730
It's too dangerous.

885
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:58,170
Oh, nah, I'll be fine.

886
01:21:58,690 --> 01:22:00,050
You shouldn't be worried about yourself.

887
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,250
What an excuse you got for me, huh?

888
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:06,410
Can you explain what this is about, too?

889
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:07,950
You knew?

890
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,530
Of course I knew.

891
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:13,150
Since when?

892
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:17,990
That's for you to know, for me to know and you to find out.

893
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:20,830
You weren't asleep?

894
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:23,110
What should I do now?

895
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:25,290
What should I do now?

896
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:27,150
Frick it.

897
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:28,850
Come at me, bish.

898
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:31,890
Does she not?

899
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:32,950
Does she actually swear?

900
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,350
I feel like, I don't know.

901
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:41,850
Chibi's skill converts up to eight random dokey pops on screen into a derpy dokey pop that does less damage when popped.

902
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:44,570
Make sure to look closely when chaining so you don't mix up.

903
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:45,450
What the hell?

904
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:45,810
Okay.

905
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:50,460
Okay.

906
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,900
Okay, like, but I still have to pop them, right?

907
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,880
I guess, like, if I...

908
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,580
My mix is...

909
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,300
Mixes with it.

910
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,080
Um...

911
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:03,940
Oh, she does?

912
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:04,540
Okay.

913
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:05,860
I feel like...

914
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,080
I don't hear her swear that much.

915
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:08,800
But maybe it's because of...

916
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,060
My swearing...

917
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,940
I swear so much that anyone that swears less than me...

918
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,240
I don't register it.

919
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:14,940
Like...

920
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:20,840
It's just like...

921
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,320
I feel like...

922
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,020
No, or maybe because, like, I swear so much...

923
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:28,000
that, like, when someone else swears, it's just, like, daily conversation in general.

924
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:33,200
Like, I just don't notice, recognizes it anymore.

925
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:36,980
Okay, there it is.

926
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:37,480
I'll just pop.

927
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,160
Oh, I can't even pop it.

928
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,440
I mean, like, what do I...

929
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,720
I can't really do anything about it.

930
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:46,640
I'll just pop.

931
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,120
Oh, my God.

932
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:50,440
I have to... I have to wait for her to pop it, I guess.

933
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:51,980
Oh, my God!

934
01:23:52,060 --> 01:24:02,260
How much more do you wanted she has so many okay it does half anyway so it doesn't matter to me

01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:54,250
Just please.

956
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:57,250
I said don't turn into cheebies.

957
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:01,570
All right.

958
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:02,410
We got this.

959
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:06,970
And then.

960
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,190
There we go.

961
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:09,920
I did it.

962
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:11,730
Her head has laughed.

963
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:13,470
I was like, where did she go?

964
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:14,750
Did she disappear?

965
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:21,530

Oh, hey, it's my tomato drying.

969
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:03,090
It's a dragon god?

970
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:07,030
I'm not sure.

971
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:12,730
The dragon god?

972
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:14,350
Wait a second.

973
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:16,050
This isn't a dragon god.

974
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:19,050
This is the doki-pop god.

975
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:21,210
Wait, am I going to fight myself?

976
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:33,470

01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:42,910

979
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:56,350
release the toky patch.

980
01:30:57,690 --> 01:31:02,730
Look, I came here because you said you helped me beat toky and get those tickets.

981
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:05,430
Why don't you relax yourself, Miss Mint?

982
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:08,230
One thing at a time.

983
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:12,790
We have a common enemy, Miss Mint.

984
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:16,050
And I see potential to you.

985
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:18,910
Enemy, she's just my opponent.

986
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:20,590
That's not that serious.

987
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:23,290
Enemy are important.

988
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:56,330
that point is that if your friend loses I win and you win your suspicions are valid miss mint I promise you can trust me sure I can I've been acting weird since the first time we met understandable to show you how genuine I am I will give you a taste of that power you crave.

989
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:59,930
Let's say, as a gift of trust.

990
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:05,490
There's a mirror where that came from.

991
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:10,710
And as I said, as long as you're on my side, I'm on yours.

992
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:12,010
Teal?

993
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,390
But that's cheating.

994
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:18,570
Dokey Pop is supposed to be a game of skill.

995
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:23,450
A game of skill.

996
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:27,630
Since when is that case for any competition?

997
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:30,550
I'm not going to do that.

998
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:34,730
You're being too naive, Miss Mint.

999
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,410
Come, take a look.

1000
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:39,810
Is that Doki?

1001
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:41,750
Where is she going?

1002
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:44,350
To Doki Pop Island.

1003
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:46,610
Our destination.

1004
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:50,010
Oh my god, he is Lord Palpatine.

1005
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:52,710
Oh, I fucking knew it.

1006
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:56,990
I knew he was going to backstab me.

1007
01:32:57,930 --> 01:33:06,290
Yes, on the island is a relic that has the power of the ancient Toki Pop God.

1008
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:13,830
You say the one who wields the relic wields the power of the Toki Pop God.

1009
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:16,450
The unlimited power.

1010
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:20,630
Toki, I can't believe she will resort to something like that.

1011
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:27,190
Pop has never been a game about skill, Miss Mint.

1012
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:31,970
So, will you join me?

1013
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:36,110
Okay, but first we need to stop Joki from getting the relic.

1014
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:39,130
Don't worry about it.

1015
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:41,670
I got it covered.

1016
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,170
Oh, there's Shibi.

1017
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:45,230
Hmm.

1018
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:47,010
If you say so.

1019
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:49,070
Then deal.

1020
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:53,570
Bro, I feel like obviously he's the more evil one.

1021
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,570
He's wearing a fucking hood!

1022
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:58,910
You've gone far enough.

1023
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:01,310
I can't let you through, Doki.

1024
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:03,390
Wait a minute, where are you talking?

1025
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:05,630
Prepare yourself, Doki bird!

1026
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:07,330
Okay, wait.

1027
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:10,190
Okay, this... this is not fair.

1028
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:12,690
Bro, I said nerf her.

1029
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:18,090
Alright, it's the same skill.

1030
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:20,070
Guys, what happened to nerfing her?

1031
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:21,830
Why am I fighting her again?

1032
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:28,590
I thought we had a deal with my devs.

1033
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:33,510
What happened to our agreement?

1034
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:37,110
Okay.

1035
01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:41,410
I'm just gonna make this first.

1036
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:43,150
Oh my gosh, she popped it.

1037
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:43,890
Oh, you whore.

1038
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:48,210
Okay, uh.

1039
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:53,290
I knew, no, I swear to God, I swear, okay, there you go.

1040
01:34:55,170 --> 01:34:55,810
Uh...

1041
01:34:55,810 --> 01:34:56,990
I can't really do anything.

1042
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,330
I just pop this for now.

1043
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:01,950
I can do that and then pop these two.

1044
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,590
Oh!

1045
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:05,050
Fuck!

1046
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,020
Okay.

1047
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,560
That's fine.

1048
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:13,420
I'll use this.

1049
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,340
Do a little chop chop.

1050
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,200
And then do that.

1051
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:18,960
And then chop chop!

1052
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:22,920
Where are the whiffs?

1053
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:24,500
God damn it.

1054
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:37,480

Oh my god, there's so many.

1059
01:37:25,870 --> 01:37:26,930
Are you serious?

1060
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:28,650
That was on her!

1061
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:30,010
Okay.

1062
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:31,170
It's fine.

1063
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,900
Oh my god, it's just...

01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:42,760
Please.

1065
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:43,300
No!

1066
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:45,600
It's fine.

1067
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:46,960
I don't need it.

1068
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:48,960
Oh my god, I need it.

1069
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:50,980
No!

1070
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,300
No!

1071
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:07,680
I'm trying to figure I can't believe it I wasn't I was I didn't mean to pop it

1072
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:21,140
Oh my god I need more midheads I actually need more midheads I need to get rid of all these other ones

1073
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:35,420
Oh my god Oh my god This is good This is good Oh my god This is good.

1074
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,800
We're slowly getting them out of here.

1075
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:55,220
Please just give me more midheads.

1076
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:01,240
Oh my god.

1077
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,160
I accidentally wasn't supposed to pop that.

1078
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,540
I need to build up more.

1079
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:06,280
I didn't realize I had to build up more heads.

1080
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,480
Oh, this is not looking so well.

1081
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,460
This is not.

1082
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:17,480
We're not okay.

1083
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,260
We are not okay.

1084
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,340
I need more heads.

1085
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:21,460
I need more.

1086
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:22,940
I need more midheads.

1087
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,640
Okay Oh my god.

1088
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:26,160
Thank god.

1089
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:27,060
Oh my god.

1090
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:27,240
Okay.

1091
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,080
There you go.

1092
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:34,250
All right.

1093
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:37,310
This is not okay.

1094
01:39:38,050 --> 01:39:40,610
This is actually not okay right now.

1095
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:41,510
We are not okay.

1096
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:42,490
We are absent.

1097
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:43,410
No!

1098
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:44,430
No!

1099
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:46,390
That is fair!

1100
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:48,770
Why did I click this

1101
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:57,520
abide?

1102
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:58,980
I couldn't click!

1103
01:39:59,100 --> 01:39:59,400
Did you not?

1104
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:14,200
see it did you not see it there was a bug there was a bug okay guys there was did you not see that bug it shrank okay

1105
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:23,460
uh all

1106
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:29,250
right um

1107
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:38,730
it's just there no no you can't say that the wrist have just showed up.

1108
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:41,770
It just showed up.

1109
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:44,330
It was not supposed to shrink yet.

1110
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:48,790
Are you fucking kidding me?

1111
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:50,170
She popped it.

1112
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:52,250
That wasn't her to pop.

1113
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:55,290
It was property of dokeybird.

1114
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,140
We need popping these.

1115
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:12,630
She keeps popping them before I can get it to the whips.

1116
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:14,190
She just keeps popping it.

1117
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:15,110
This is illegal.

1118
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:23,350
I demand to see my lawyer.

1119
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:31,180
Where is it?

1120
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:37,610
Alright.

1121
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:45,620
Here we go.

1122
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,200
God damn, I accidentally clicked.

1123
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:48,360
I wasn't supposed to click that.

1124
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:53,980
Okay, there you go.

1125
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:55,460
Um.

1126
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,800
Oh my god.

1127
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:00,420
It's not fair.

1128
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:03,900
There you go.

1129
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:05,340
We got rid of one of the wisp.

1130
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:14,360
Okay.

1131
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:18,780
Okay, there you go.

1132
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:22,780
Just try and send as many out of here as possible so I can pop that.

1133
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:27,490
Oh my god.

1134
01:42:27,630 --> 01:42:29,250
Literally that I just made.

1135
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:29,630
Okay.

1136
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:30,290
It's fine.

1137
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:30,670
It's fine.

1138
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:31,270
It's fine.

1139
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:32,330
It's fine.

1140
01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:36,110
It's fine.

1141
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,310
We got rid of him.

1142
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:38,550
It's okay.

1143
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:39,770
It's fine.

1144
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:41,870
It's so fine.

1145
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:43,090
Oh,

1146
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,560
I gotta get these guys out of here.

1147
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:51,280
There we go.

1148
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:53,020
I'm fine.

1149
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:58,700
How does she have so much HP?

1150
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,840
I don't understand.

1151
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:03,980
This is like, it feels so illegal.

1152
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:13,330
Okay.

1153
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:21,540
Oh my god, that doesn't pop it.

1154
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,360
That should have been a pop.

1155
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,200
What?

1156
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:33,220
Okay, I'm like looking at it by size.

1157
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:37,240
Like, I know, like, I'm fucking it up by just looking at it based off of size.

1158
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:46,440
Wait, all the whisper gun.

1159
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:47,980
What happened to them?

1160
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,000
No questions asked.

1161
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,400
No, I shouldn't ask any questions.

1162
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:54,440
I'll take what I can get.

1163
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,640
I'll take what I can get.

1164
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:00,880
I don't know what happened to them, but that's fine.

1165
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,260
I don't care enough to know.

1166
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,560
Okay.

1167
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:10,200
Um, I don't think we're making it, guys.

1168
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:14,680
I think we gotta say our final prayers today.

1169
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:15,120
Alright.

1170
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:19,660
Guys.

1171
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:25,620

1174
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:31,040
Nah.

1175
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:39,940
Alright, there we go.

1176
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:42,820
Nah, I don't think so.

1177
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:43,800
It's not me.

1178
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:45,800
It's this...

1179
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,440
It's this patch.

1180
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,620
It's not me.

1181
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,460
It can't be me.

1182
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,800
Oh, I forgot the knife.

1183
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:03,260
It's not me, it's her.

1184
01:46:12,930 --> 01:46:13,250
Yeah.

1185
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:17,890
Oh my god, wait, I can do this.

1186
01:46:23,730 --> 01:46:24,750
We got rid of that.

1187
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:30,100
I'll get rid of this first.

1188
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:34,520
I can put this in here.

1189
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,640
And then she can burst that if she wants to.

1190
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:39,220
There we go.

1191
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:44,140
Okay.

1192
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:49,420
I have knife soon.

1193
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:51,100
Oh, my God.

1194
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,860
Of course she fucking comes in here.

1195
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:54,500
Oh, wait, it's gone.

1196
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:55,040
Nice.

1197
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:56,720
That's right.

1198
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,000
Be gone, you witch.

1199
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:02,420
Be gone.

1200
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,240
Christ compels you.

1201
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:14,320
Okay.

1202
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:19,130
Alright.

1203
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:20,750
Knife tab.

Nice.

1205
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:23,630

Like, someone call the cops!

1212
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:54,230

01:48:55,310 --> 01:48:58,610

01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:03,730
There you go.

1215
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:05,250
I got rid of that, at least.

1216
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,340
Get them out of here.

1217
01:49:18,610 --> 01:49:18,970
Okay.

1218
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:23,890
There's a lot of whiz down there, so this should be enough to get rid of half of that.

1219
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:25,430
Alright, stop my knife.

1220
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:32,020
I'm gonna steal this.

1221
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,340
Alright, there we go.

1222
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:35,660
Come.

1223
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:36,540
There you go.

1224
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:37,860
Alright, I don't need the dirty patch.

1225
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:38,340
I'm good.

1226
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:43,900
I- I'm just that much of a- I don't need the dirty patch, guys.

1227
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:45,840
JK.

1228
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:47,800
JK, I'm okay now.

1229
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:48,780
I'm okay.

1230
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:53,360
I'm okay.

1231
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:54,000
Grr.

1232
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:55,900
Hmm.

1233
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:02,400
I can't believe my plan worked flawlessly.

1234
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:08,080
The power of Doki Pop-Kan is now mine.

1235
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:11,740
Huh?

1236
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:12,800
Huh?

1237
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:16,000
No, it was you.

1238
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:18,960
You betrayed me?

1239
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:23,360
Do you really think that I'll give you this power that easily?

1240
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,020
Huh, naive mis-meant.

1241
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:58,940
with this no one will ever underestimate me anymore so it's like mid brian griffin and i'm like the rest of the family who can't understand what the fuck he's saying like oh my god he's naked now donkey abber doge surprise but why why you dare ask why for the longest time I've been under your shadow.

1242
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:00,880
Always being underestimated.

1243
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:02,880
Like I was just a silly dog.

1244
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,760
You didn't know any better.

1245
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:06,640
That didn't know any better.

1246
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:07,880
At first I accepted it.

1247
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:09,220
But as time moved on.

1248
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:12,020
I began to feel as though I amounted to nothing.

1249
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:13,120
And then all I see is like.

1250
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:14,740
Ro, ro, ro, ro, ro, ro, ro, ro.

1251
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,160
I realize nothing will ever change.

1252
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:20,400
Or the way things stand now.

1253
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:21,060
No.

1254
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:23,420
I cannot accept that fate.

1255
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:25,200
You know, oh, I can hear him.

1256
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,260
I can understand him now.

1257
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:28,660
You don't amount to nothing.

1258
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,260
You matter to me.

1259
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:35,380
Next time we meet, you'll see what I truly am capable of.

1260
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:37,620
The dough strikes back.

1261
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:40,260
No, don't!

1262
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:40,860
Ah!

1263
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:42,280
Shit!

1264
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:46,000
Dad, you can't contain the dokeypop guide.

1265
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,980
There you go.

1266
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:50,780
I'm underestimating me again.

1267
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:52,900
Dad, stop!

1268
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:55,400
If you keep going, you'll die!

1269
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,180
Shut your mouth.

1270
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:57,820
Trap.

1271
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:00,360
I'll prove you wrong.

1272
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,340
Let's try out my newfound powers, shall we?

1273
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:08,780
Oh my god, I fight literal god.

1274
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:09,740
Alright.

1275
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:13,900
A dokey bob god will drain your HP and spawn in minions that lock.

1276
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:20,700
So you have a stroke rate.

1277
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:21,740
Is that a real word?

1278
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:24,180
Not N...

1279
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:25,900
What?

1280
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:26,640
What?

1281
01:52:27,200 --> 01:53:03,920
near what that seems what is that it's real nail atrophy donkey pop stroke change i was like am i having a stroke right now like it's a very common word who from one country like Oh my god, please don't cancel me if it's like actually a common word in a country that I'm ignorant about.

1282
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:05,200
I'm just ignorant, guys.

1283
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:10,100
If it is actually a common word in a certain country, and I just did, I'm sorry.

1284
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:11,120
Don't cancel me.

1285
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:24,020
Try to make the locked doki pops bigger by popping pieces near them or use your skill to destroy the minions.

1286
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:25,140
Wait, what?

1287
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:28,380
All right, here you go.

1288
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:34,220
Um, okay, I have to pop pieces near it.

1289
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:36,840
I use that word.

1290
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,600
How do you not know that word, dokey?

1291
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:42,160
I use it every day.

1292
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:46,140
I mean, I'm the ignorant one.

1293
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:47,560
Already?

1294
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:50,000
Oh, my God!

1295
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:51,620
My dokey bomb!

1296
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:54,340
Bro!

1297
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,560
What?

1298
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:04,280
Okay, this might not be fair.

1299
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:09,140
Guys, do I even win this?

1300
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:18,490

01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:34,720
Um, did you want to lock another one?

1304
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:36,100
I got

1305
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,400
the fight back.

1306
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:43,000
Ow!

1307
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:45,380

1308
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,220

Wait, I broke the game.

1315
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:46,140
I wasn't supposed to beat God.

1316
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:51,520
I don't think, I don't think I was supposed to beat God.

1317
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:53,280
Oh, no.

1318
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:54,860
Where I could get back there.

1319
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:00,760
I could get back to, I would consider an alternative career in game QA.

1320
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,960
Thank you for the super chat, Rice.

1321
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:04,300
Thank you.

1322
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:06,660
Guys, I know what to do.

1323
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,480
Alan, how did you break the game?

1324
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:13,840
I don't know.

1325
01:56:16,340 --> 01:56:17,860
What did I do?

1326
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:22,220
Thank you for the super chat, Alan.

1327
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:25,460
I don't know what I did.

1328
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:31,360
They didn't expect you to beat the guy.

1329
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:35,360
Alright, I'm back.

1330
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,520
I'm back.

1331
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:39,300
Guys, I know how to beat a god.

1332
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:40,420
Watch this.

1333
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,700
I did it.

1334
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:55,000
Oh, that was too easy.

1335
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,500
Like taking candy from a baby.

1336
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:01,720
You're so strong.

1337
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:05,760
The power of the doki-pop god.

1338
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:07,060
Huh?

1339
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:09,940
I can't move.

1340
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:12,600
Help me!

1341
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,660
It's still a lot.

1342
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:17,880
Yeah, script is a lot.

1343
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,000
Oh my god.

1344
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,440
What happened?

1345
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:24,360
I know.

1346
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:26,260
Oh my god, flashbang.

1347
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:29,400
Even that, even the afterlife is creepy.

1348
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:32,500
Oh, it's the feather!

1349
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:36,520
The creepy old man gave me a piece of his hair!

1350
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:38,860
The Grand Wizard!

1351
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:40,260
Same.

1352
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:41,560
Dragoon?

1353
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:44,320
You... you died?

1354
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:46,420
Ouch!

1355
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:49,180
Such disrespect.

1356
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:55,020
I have not died yet, foolish young master, and neither have you.

1357
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:57,620
Then where are we?

1358
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:03,520
A passageway between time, space, and spirit.

1359
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:06,520
A source of it all.

1360
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:08,800
A place where we manifest ourselves.

1361
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:09,960
That's why.

1362
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,120
We are able to connect.

1363
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:13,680
Huh?

1364
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:18,740
Young Master, I was called upon for a reason.

1365
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:22,420
What could possibly diminish the Young Master's smile?

1366
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:25,940
I think I disappointed a close friend.

1367
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:31,040
Young Master, remember what I told you last time?

1368
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:34,820
About how you're wanting me to use Joki Pop to connect people?

1369
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,020
I am glad.

1370
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:40,260
Young Master, listen to my words.

1371
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,560
What about it?

1372
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:47,240
Doki-pop, in one way or another, is a form of art.

1373
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:49,980
And art is a form of language.

1374
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:54,340
Within Doki-pop, there is communication.

1375
01:58:54,940 --> 01:58:58,180
Where there is communication, there is connection.

1376
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:02,880
Yes, communication about defeating each other for sure.

1377
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:07,920
Young Master, I request you to look further beyond the veil.

1378
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:10,260
What do you feel while at this very moment?

1379
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:10,700
moment.

1380
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:17,220
Remember all the times we have sparred all the things you've been through in every connection.

1381
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:21,620
Every you see it, young master?

1382
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:26,340
Every time you did an action, there was a reaction.

1383
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,980
Oh, like a chain reaction.

1384
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:37,440
Each action and reaction are a dance between the souls that I predict.

1385
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:40,260
Okay, it was this bullshit that you guys wrote in the script?

1386
01:59:40,280 --> 02:00:43,080
like are you just bullshitting like each action and reaction are a dance between the souls that are participating action reaction action reaction all of them connect into a cohesive line he's just making it up on the fly eventually the line reaches its conclusion and then you realize it's not just the fight that you experience young master it's a conversation young master my request is for you to connect with others using the power of jokipop using the power of friendship oh my god friendship is magic now young master You have some unfinished business,

1387
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:44,020
don't you?

1388
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:46,260
Shall we bring you back?

1389
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:52,390
This time with the power of friendship.

1390
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:53,830
Thank you, Old Bird.

1391
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,070
You're always welcome, young master.

1392
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:59,790
Let him cook.

1393
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:07,020
Jokey pop, God.

1394
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:12,160
I challenge you to a fight as you wish.

1395
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:14,040
All right.

1396
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:19,060
Okay, maybe this time it won't be like as fucked up.

1397
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:26,200
Maybe this time, like I could actually do something.

1398
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:33,500
Okay, all right, he actually lets me fucking play the game.

1399
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,140
All right, that's good.

1400
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:38,540
I can actually exist in this game.

1401
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,600
Thank God.

1402
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:43,540
All right.

1403
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:50,180
I'm glad I'm glad he lets me play it out

1404
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:14,880
Big pop All right, use that net Boom

1405
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:19,740
That's right, my pop

1406
02:02:24,020 --> 02:02:25,440
All right, pop pop Pop.

1407
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:30,140
That should make a big one.

1408
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,780
Excuse me, I swear you got it.

1409
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:32,660
You locked this one.

1410
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:33,420
Okay, thank God.

1411
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:35,820
Okay, I got worried that he's going to lock that one.

1412
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:37,780
He's like, I need that.

1413
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:38,920
I need that to live.

1414
02:02:42,220 --> 02:02:43,260
Okay, that's good.

1415
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:47,620
And then I can have this one too.

1416
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:51,540
Oh,

1417
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,080
please don't lock another one.

1418
02:02:56,720 --> 02:03:02,340
I'm gonna grab this just as I can.

1419
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,640
Alright, I have a knife.

1420
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:06,360
I kept the knife just for this.

1421
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:09,360
Wait, what does it mean when it's red?

1422
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:09,900
I forgot.

1423
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:11,640
I forgot.

1424
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:12,220
No!

1425
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,220
What?

1426
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:18,000
How did he get it?

1427
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:31,720
This is a little bad.

1428
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:33,560
Just a little bit.

1429
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:35,180
Maybe a lot.

1430
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:37,000
No, just a little bit, guys.

1431
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:37,760
Just a little bit.

1432
02:03:37,780 --> 02:04:01,020

1436
02:04:48,710 --> 02:04:49,390
All right, nice.

1437
02:04:53,310 --> 02:04:54,270
Oh, my God.

1438
02:04:58,310 --> 02:05:01,330
I can be the God, and then I will be the next God.

1439
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:05,510
And then, and then it's timeout time.

1440
02:05:07,050 --> 02:05:07,910
Okay, that's fine.

1441
02:05:09,090 --> 02:05:11,710
I swear, even God was easier than me.

1442
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:13,170
Like, what is this bullshit?

1443
02:05:17,270 --> 02:05:18,730
Okay, this is...

1444
02:05:18,730 --> 02:05:20,870
I demand a Doki patch right now.

1445
02:05:21,110 --> 02:05:23,170
I demand a patch.

1446
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:25,910
God, the sequel.

1447
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:32,920
Yeah.

1448
02:05:41,650 --> 02:05:42,830
Alright, we did it.

1449
02:05:42,990 --> 02:05:43,910
We beat God.

1450
02:05:44,690 --> 02:05:46,630
Become God, Doki.

1451
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:53,820
You are amusing, Mortal.

1452
02:05:55,120 --> 02:05:58,480
It's been a long time since Mortal has last best in me.

1453
02:05:58,820 --> 02:06:02,060
Tell me, why do you doki-pop?

1454
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,500
I doki-pop so I can connect with people.

1455
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:08,440
Fascinating.

1456
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:12,100
You've done very well, Miss doki-bird.

1457
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,960
And such a fate should not go unrewarded.

1458
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:18,260
But tell me, what is it that you desire?

1459
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:20,880
Please leave my dog's body.

1460
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,640
Well, I guess exploring is for another day.

1461
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:26,840
Very well.

1462
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:28,640

That can't be the real dad.

1470
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:37,900
He is apologizing.

1471
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:40,100
Mr. Miffluffikins, thank you for the super chat.

1472

Thank you.

I really enjoyed the story and the gameplay.

1498
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:45,600
I thought it would be like a Suka game, a Suka, but it was like, you know, it was definitely not like Suka.

1499
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:48,240
It was its own little mechanic and everything.

1500
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:52,560
So huge shout out again to the Jokey Pop devs.

1507
02:10:31,150 --> 02:11:32,270
doing like we're streaming at twitch con or we're doing like uh twitch rivals and stuff they had like uh what are they called what like that it wasn't like malware but something that could like control like the pc and stuff yeah i don't know what the is it called malware like yeah and then it was like accessing the browser and everything and like typing shit in their browser and stuff remote desktop yeah i think is that what it's called yeah remote access yeah so some of the PCs had remote access downloaded for some reason and then um and then um like live on stream it like tat like it tad out of like a gate someone like people's games and then opening browsers and just start typing random shit in their browsers i don't remember it was like some fucking it was like it was crazy yeah yeah a lot of people's accounts are at risk with that too i thought that was the first time i've heard about it happening at twitch con i was actually at a land.

1508
02:11:32,410 --> 02:11:34,850
This is the first time I've heard about it at a fucking land event.

1509
02:11:35,410 --> 02:11:37,110
Yeah, it runs scripts and stuff.

1510
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:40,850
I don't know if you guys heard about it.

1511
02:11:40,990 --> 02:11:54,630
I thought about it because, like, I was thinking about it because when I, like, it like came in my head, because when I was like, when I was like, right, you know when, uh, when you open a dot ex and they're like, uh, do you really want to run this game?

like the PCs were compromised one day dad was feeling underappreciated you had to change that with a call no don't cancel me yeah she was playing a tournament and then like her game all tabbed and opened a browser and started typing some random like a script started typing some random url url on stream while it was happening we have a call-up post of course you won't believe the treat situation oh no it's toky bird finally over i gotta find this channel delete it and the dragons were in the no why believe her guys what happened to believing her what happened okay wait All right,

Oh, it's because that one's out of steel.

1548
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:28,880

So I gotta take them out.

1550
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,480

1640
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:30,940

1641
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:31,800
There's heals.

1642
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:34,900
Oh my god, you're not shooting back.

1643
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:35,560

02:19:52,020 --> 02:19:53,280
Wait, am I doing anything?

1651
02:19:53,980 --> 02:19:54,720

1690
02:22:51,350 --> 02:22:51,890

It's fine.

1694
02:22:57,830 --> 02:22:59,520
Everything was fine in the end.

1695
02:23:00,670 --> 02:23:02,370
Just gotta walk this way now.

1696
02:23:04,010 --> 02:23:04,750
There's more.

1697
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:06,830

1698
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:08,510

Wait, how the fuck did I get hit?

1704
02:23:24,750 --> 02:23:25,810
How did I get hit?

1705
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:30,960

That's right.

1709
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:41,900
Oh my god, there's two of them.

1710
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:43,860
But it's okay.

1711
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:46,320
I have this to guide me.

1712
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:47,440
That's why I'm coming over.

1713
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:49,540
Get out of here.

1714
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:54,280
Nobody's canceling me today.

1715
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:58,960
But how do I set this up?

1716
02:23:59,160 --> 02:23:59,980
Whoops.

1717
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:04,720
Well, I could have done it without blowing myself up, but that works too.

1718
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:07,020
That...

1719
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:08,860
Oh, bring it up overall a little bit.

1720
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:09,500
All right.

1721
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:10,400
I brought it up.

1722
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:14,940
There we go.

1723
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:18,440
Ah, that's right.

1724
02:24:18,940 --> 02:24:21,360
Cage by your own dynamite.

1725
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:24,140
Just as smart as me.

1726
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:26,160
Free kill.

1727
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:30,020
Okay.

1728
02:24:30,980 --> 02:24:32,240
Got you now.

1729
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:34,980
Oh, no.

1730
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:37,180
Oh, I can aim up.

1731
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:39,260
That's good.

1732
02:24:39,340 --> 02:24:40,440
That's good to know.

1733
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:43,320
Oh, my God.

1734
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:44,120
Oh, my God.

1735
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:45,760
That was like 20 of them.

1736
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:48,540
Alright.

1737
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:53,540
How many snipers are there?

1738
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:55,580
It's fine.

1739
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:56,000
It's fine.

1740
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:57,760
Let's get out of this.

1741
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:00,800
Oh, my God.

1742
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:01,640
There's so many bullets.

1743
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:03,040
It's like, it's like Toho.

1744
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:04,940
It's like Toho.

1745
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:07,520
I'm trying my best.

1746
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:08,980
I'm shimmying.

1747
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:11,000
I'm dodging.

1748
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:12,640
I'm doing snake maneuvers.

1749
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:15,680
Oh, wait.

1750
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:16,060
Nice.

1751
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:17,080
Rehealth.

1752
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:19,360
Rehealth.

1753
02:25:20,980 --> 02:25:21,620
Oh, shit.

1754
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:23,720
All right, we go down.

1755
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:25,240
Wait, do we go down?

1756
02:25:25,740 --> 02:25:27,100
Oh, my God.

1757
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:30,240
We let you grow up to be that big.

1758
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:36,400
Oh, no, that's big daddy right there.

1759
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:41,320

02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:49,620
He ate his weed.

1763
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:52,720
He drank his milk, guys.

1764
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:56,540
See, this is what happens when you start drinking milk.

1765
02:25:57,920 --> 02:25:59,220

Oh, was it the part where like the...

1776

Big Goon didn't fit and fight back.

Was that it?

1778
02:28:07,450 --> 02:28:13,430
Like, he just stood there medicinally and watched me slowly kill him.

1779
02:28:13,790 --> 02:28:16,810
Was that the part where it wasn't supposed to be broken?

1780
02:28:17,170 --> 02:28:19,970
Yeah, he was supposed to fire cannons.

1781
02:28:20,650 --> 02:28:21,110

I was going to be like, wow, he's just standing there, literally.

1785
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:28,610

1793
02:30:27,610 --> 02:30:30,150
Because you have to make a level that's like really...

And fun to play.

1797
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:39,330
And I don't know if I can make it fun to play.

1798
02:30:39,470 --> 02:30:40,510
For myself.

The game doesn't get it.

1861
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:36,980
It's not me.

1862
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:39,820
Wait, wait.

Okay, there we go.

1873
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:15,880
All right.

Okay, that...

1883
02:39:18,090 --> 02:39:20,010
Apparently, that was actually not it.

1884
02:39:22,650 --> 02:39:23,250
Um...

1885
02:39:23,250 --> 02:39:24,310

Okay.

1888
02:39:30,630 --> 02:39:31,230
Um...

1889
02:39:31,230 --> 02:39:31,890

Give me a sec.

1893
02:39:36,850 --> 02:39:37,590
Let me...

1894
02:39:37,590 --> 02:39:39,410
Okay, that does nothing.

1895
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:40,690
That's good to know.

1896
02:39:41,650 --> 02:39:42,250
That's...

1897
02:39:42,270 --> 02:39:43,610
Okay, I...

1898
02:39:44,070 --> 02:39:45,690
Okay, wait, wait, I figured it out.

1899
02:39:47,490 --> 02:39:48,730
Oh my god, I knew it.

1900
02:39:48,850 --> 02:39:49,110
Okay.

1901
02:39:53,470 --> 02:39:55,870
Alright, I figured it out, though.

1902
02:40:01,230 --> 02:40:02,870
I was on top of it.

1903
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:03,970
I don't understand.

1904
02:40:05,550 --> 02:40:05,990
Um...

1905
02:40:05,990 --> 02:40:08,110
So I don't know what to do after...

1906
02:40:08,110 --> 02:40:08,450
Okay.

1907
02:40:14,770 --> 02:40:15,210
Okay.

1908
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:39,280
Where would you go?

1909
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:41,940
No, I can't move.

1910
02:40:42,080 --> 02:40:43,000
I can only move him.

1911
02:40:46,940 --> 02:40:47,460
Trick shot?

1912
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:48,580
Where, though?

1913
02:40:53,460 --> 02:40:54,340
Okay, wait.

1914
02:40:54,520 --> 02:40:55,380
I figured it out.

1915
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:02,480
I figured it out.

1916
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:03,900
Oh

1917
02:41:22,010 --> 02:41:23,410
It's gonna be sick.

1918
02:41:23,710 --> 02:41:24,530
I got it.

1919
02:41:24,810 --> 02:41:25,550
It'll be a sick.

1920
02:41:25,750 --> 02:41:26,570
I-

1921
02:41:33,020 --> 02:41:38,960
Oh my god, I'm getting- I need to get past the- I need to get past the first stage and it's just-

1922
02:41:43,100 --> 02:41:44,420
Maybe it's here

1923
02:41:51,320 --> 02:41:52,760
Oh my god, okay.

1924
02:41:54,520 --> 02:41:57,000
Maybe I move him here.

1925
02:42:00,700 --> 02:42:02,060
I just gotta master this jump.

1926
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:04,460
I just gotta master this jump.

1927
02:42:05,140 --> 02:42:07,020
I just gotta master this.

1928
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:09,880
I just gotta master this.

1929
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:16,800
I figured it out.

1930
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:23,600
When I master this jump, it's okay.

1931
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:24,120
There you go.

1932
02:42:24,220 --> 02:42:24,560
Goodbye.

1933
02:42:30,970 --> 02:42:33,430
Where do I go after that?

1934
02:42:40,080 --> 02:42:41,560
Okay, never mind.

1935
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:43,620
I thought I was so smart with that.

1936
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:45,700
I guess never mind.

1937
02:42:46,040 --> 02:42:48,260
I was like, oh, it floats.

1938
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:52,840
There's another side of the brick.

1939
02:42:53,380 --> 02:42:53,860
Where?

1940
02:42:54,620 --> 02:42:57,440
I don't think I can do any better.

1941
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:06,440
Wait.

1942
02:43:09,320 --> 02:43:10,540
Oh my god, you're so right.

1943
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:15,140
Oh my god, you're so right.

1944
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:17,040
Okay.

1945
02:43:25,530 --> 02:43:27,050
Wait, is it a rocket jump?

1946
02:43:35,720 --> 02:43:37,820
It was not a rocket jump.

1947
02:43:38,900 --> 02:43:41,580
It was not a ride.

1948
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:49,140
Oh my god.

1949
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:50,460
I wish I could just shoot this.

1950
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:52,660
I wish I could just shoot this.

1951
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:52,900
Ow!

1952
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:02,340
Okay, add chat.

1953
02:44:02,480 --> 02:44:03,320
Okay, that's it.

1954
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:04,200
Add chat.

1955
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:04,940
Add.

1956
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:06,080
Why?

1957
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:10,640
Under the bricks.

1958
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:12,360
Before that.

1959
02:44:12,420 --> 02:44:46,400
brick what what the fuck this brick how use the TNT oh you can do that wait where the fuck is it wait right oh my god wait oh my god I'm so smart Okay,

1961
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:05,180
I jump here.

1962
02:45:06,580 --> 02:45:07,820
Does that destroy...

1963
02:45:07,820 --> 02:45:08,980
That should destroy everything.

1964
02:45:09,140 --> 02:45:10,260
It should destroy all of that.

1965
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:13,500
But then, like, what do I do from here, though?

1966
02:45:14,500 --> 02:45:18,080
Oh, I shoot that, and then this could destroy all of this.

1967
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:19,900
Oh, I see.

1968
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:20,220
I see.

1969
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:20,940

1970
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:22,180
I see.

1971
02:45:22,260 --> 02:45:22,260
I see.

1972
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:23,600
I'm brainstorming.

1973
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:26,820
Okay, I...

1974
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:30,640
I just gotta figure this part out first.

1975
02:45:40,430 --> 02:45:42,130
Is the dev here right now?

1976
02:45:47,030 --> 02:45:48,930
Is the dev here right?

1977
02:45:48,930 --> 02:45:52,830
I would like to know if the developer is here right now.

1978
02:46:01,130 --> 02:46:05,930
I just have a little patch note for you.

1979
02:46:05,990 --> 02:46:09,190
A little suggestion.

1980
02:46:18,010 --> 02:46:21,170
A little suggestion for your game.

1981
02:46:23,050 --> 02:46:23,530
It's fine.

1982
02:46:23,730 --> 02:46:23,930
It's fine.

1983
02:46:24,130 --> 02:46:24,470
It's fine.

1984
02:46:26,490 --> 02:46:26,930
It's fine.

1985
02:46:27,030 --> 02:46:29,050
Oh my god.

1986
02:46:30,450 --> 02:46:30,890

There you go.

2032
02:52:10,370 --> 02:52:11,890
You guys have to figure out the trick shot, though.

2033
02:52:13,450 --> 02:52:14,050
Okay, don't.

2034
02:52:14,070 --> 02:52:14,910
Don't do it.

2035
02:52:15,930 --> 02:52:17,210
You know you want to.

2036
02:52:17,610 --> 02:52:19,290
You know you want to.

2037
02:52:22,970 --> 02:52:24,030
Oh, you're right.

2038
02:52:24,270 --> 02:52:25,150
That spooky block.

2039
02:52:26,390 --> 02:52:27,250
You're so right.

2040
02:52:32,790 --> 02:52:33,310
Okay.

2041
02:52:36,170 --> 02:52:38,510
And I'll do another trick shot right here.

2042
02:52:42,880 --> 02:52:44,140
Because I ran out of ammo.

2043
02:52:44,860 --> 02:52:45,600
Oh my god, wait.

2044
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:47,360
JK, I still...

2045
02:53:07,710 --> 02:53:08,910
All right.

2046
02:53:12,710 --> 02:53:14,290
There you go.

2047
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:19,520
All right, we got this.

2048
02:53:20,580 --> 02:53:20,880
Okay.

2049
02:53:22,460 --> 02:53:23,780
How do we do this?

2050
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:27,520
Oh, I can shoot from Belize.

2051
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:27,920
Hello?

2052
02:53:33,840 --> 02:53:35,140
Guys, I don't...

2053
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:36,420
I ran out of ammo.

2054
02:53:36,920 --> 02:53:37,580
I...

2055
02:53:37,580 --> 02:53:39,500
Maybe you have blocks.

2056
02:53:41,300 --> 02:53:42,360
Me have blocks.

2057
02:53:42,580 --> 02:53:43,760
No way.

2058
02:53:44,140 --> 02:53:45,080
Oh, fuck.

2059
02:53:51,580 --> 02:53:52,760
Oh my god, please.

2060
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:53,820
Please!

2061
02:54:00,800 --> 02:54:02,760
It'll work eventually, guys.

2062
02:54:06,180 --> 02:54:07,200
There we go.

2063
02:54:15,260 --> 02:54:17,040
Okay, how do we do this?

2064
02:54:18,100 --> 02:54:19,700
How do we do this?

2065
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:22,080
Oh my god, it's like this?

2066
02:54:22,540 --> 02:54:23,670
Guys, it was not like that.

2067
02:54:27,130 --> 02:54:28,910
Guys, guys, please.

2068
02:54:30,390 --> 02:54:32,150
Guys, what is the geometry?

2069
02:54:33,230 --> 02:54:36,530
What is the geometry?

2070
02:54:39,210 --> 02:54:44,100
Do I jump?

2071
02:54:46,560 --> 02:54:48,000
Eyeball it.

2072
02:54:50,200 --> 02:54:50,840
What?

2073
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:53,880
another block.

2074
02:54:53,980 --> 02:54:54,900
Oh, I have another ghost block.

2075
02:54:55,040 --> 02:54:55,560
Look at that.

2076
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:56,860
Okay, where do I put this ghost guy?

2077
02:54:57,360 --> 02:54:58,800
Where do I put this little ghosty?

2078
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:02,040
I don't know.

2079
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:02,800
I'm just watching.

2080
02:55:03,660 --> 02:55:06,820
One spooky block above the middle pier?

2081
02:55:07,860 --> 02:55:09,440
This spooky little guy?

2082
02:55:10,040 --> 02:55:10,820
Right here?

2083
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:13,780
Right here?

2084
02:55:13,780 --> 02:55:14,060
Oh, wait.

2085
02:55:14,120 --> 02:55:15,320
I assume it's right here.

2086
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:19,500
Yeah, okay.

2087
02:55:19,580 --> 02:55:20,140
We got this.

2088
02:55:20,220 --> 02:55:20,820
We figured it out.

2089
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:22,740
Okay.

2090
02:55:29,590 --> 02:55:31,410
Oh god, okay.

2091
02:55:33,550 --> 02:55:34,510
All right.

2092
02:55:35,730 --> 02:55:36,890
Watch this.

2093
02:55:46,290 --> 02:55:48,590
Oh my god, it actually, one bullet in a dream.

2094
02:55:49,110 --> 02:55:51,370
Actual one bullet in a dream.

2095
02:55:51,990 --> 02:55:52,930
Oh my god.

2096
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:58,420
That's the fucking bullet.

2097
02:55:58,860 --> 02:56:00,260
I told you.

2098
02:56:00,700 --> 02:56:03,400
I said, watch this.

2099
02:56:07,900 --> 02:56:09,680
Oh, calculate it.

2100
02:56:09,940 --> 02:56:12,280
Trigger happy tomatoes.

2101
02:56:12,620 --> 02:56:14,180
What the fuck do the tomatoes do?

2102
02:56:22,740 --> 02:56:24,320
What the fuck?

2103
02:56:25,900 --> 02:56:26,840
What do they do?

2104
02:56:39,660 --> 02:56:41,960
Why did you go left?

2105
02:56:43,480 --> 02:56:43,960
Oh!

2106
02:56:48,450 --> 02:56:49,610
Are you doing?

2107
02:56:49,950 --> 02:56:50,750
What?

2108
02:57:05,770 --> 02:57:08,360
Okay, I know what to do.

2109
02:57:10,970 --> 02:57:13,190
Why the fuck would I use spikes?

2110
02:57:14,230 --> 02:57:14,590
Wait.

2111
02:57:16,390 --> 02:57:18,690
What happens when it drops on the spike?

2112
02:57:22,470 --> 02:57:23,250
Oh!

2113
02:57:51,190 --> 02:57:52,810
That's fucked up.

2114
02:57:54,050 --> 02:57:55,370
That's fucked up.

2115
02:58:03,800 --> 02:58:05,700
That's really fucked up

2116
02:58:19,330 --> 02:58:30,770
There's nothing I can do It's timing Okay I think I can get rid of this And I'll put two spikes here That's gotta be it

2117
02:58:34,390 --> 02:58:42,830
Yeah There we go Like good luck Good luck to me Oh my god, this is so much worse.

2118
02:58:43,410 --> 02:58:43,410
Why?

2119
02:58:43,930 --> 02:58:44,330
Why did I?

2120
02:58:44,550 --> 02:58:45,830
This is so much worse.

2121
02:58:46,310 --> 02:58:46,310
This

2122
02:58:53,720 --> 02:58:56,220
Yeah, guys, I don't think that was the strat.

2123
02:58:57,380 --> 02:58:57,380
I

2124
02:59:01,900 --> 02:59:12,660
Um Welcome to hell We here Whoops

2125
02:59:20,670 --> 02:59:23,210
Maybe the timing won't be as bad.

2126
02:59:25,130 --> 02:59:27,410
Yeah, there's sort of...

2127
02:59:28,090 --> 02:59:28,930
I guess.

2128
02:59:35,630 --> 02:59:36,350
Oh.

2129
02:59:36,890 --> 02:59:38,690
Oh, I get it!

02:59:38,850 --> 02:59:40,110
Okay, wait, wait, I understand.

2131
02:59:44,010 --> 02:59:45,450
And then...

2132
02:59:55,890 --> 02:59:58,090
Give me a sec.

03:00:04,910 --> 03:00:06,130
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

I see.

2135
03:00:17,480 --> 03:00:19,220
Wait, I figured it out, though.

2136
03:00:34,740 --> 03:00:36,220
I don't know.

2137
03:00:37,600 --> 03:00:37,860
Okay.

2138
03:00:38,720 --> 03:00:39,000

2153
03:04:04,590 --> 03:04:08,830
Oh, that's smart.

2154
03:04:13,620 --> 03:04:14,200
Okay.

2155
03:04:15,880 --> 03:04:18,320
I take back everything I was gonna say to you, Dev.

2156
03:04:19,380 --> 03:04:25,340
Okay, my timing is so off now that it's slower though.

2157
03:04:27,720 --> 03:04:29,200
Don't worry about it.

2158
03:04:33,320 --> 03:04:43,420

It's okay.

I just gotta make that one jump.

2167
03:05:22,200 --> 03:05:23,240
And then we got here.

2168

Let's go.

2187
03:07:35,640 --> 03:07:37,560
I just had to make that harder for myself.

2188
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:41,440
I just had to.

2189
03:07:41,880 --> 03:07:44,540
I just had to make that harder for myself.

2190
03:07:45,160 --> 03:07:46,120
Oh, my God.

2191
03:07:47,260 --> 03:07:47,820
I...

2192
03:07:50,140 --> 03:07:51,280
What do you mean?

2193
03:07:51,380 --> 03:07:53,060

2194
03:07:55,640 --> 03:07:56,660
Oh, my God.

2195
03:07:57,380 --> 03:07:57,760
It's fine.

2196
03:07:57,860 --> 03:07:58,820
We got this.

2197
03:07:58,960 --> 03:07:59,780
We got...

2198
03:07:59,780 --> 03:08:00,360
Okay.

2199
03:08:00,380 --> 03:08:04,600
The ghost of Doki Pass comes in to haunt me, but I got it.

2200
03:08:11,120 --> 03:08:11,600
Alright.

2201
03:08:14,320 --> 03:08:14,800
Okay.

2202
03:08:15,360 --> 03:08:16,080
That's okay, it's okay.

2203
03:08:16,140 --> 03:08:17,460
I just mistimed it, you know?

2204
03:08:17,840 --> 03:08:19,100
Everything was so fast.

2205
03:08:19,400 --> 03:08:20,880
And I have to take it slow now.

2206
03:08:20,960 --> 03:08:22,600
Now that I have access to slow.

2207
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:25,300
I'm not used to it anymore.

2208
03:08:30,300 --> 03:08:30,780
No!

2209
03:08:36,800 --> 03:08:37,280
Okay.

2210
03:08:37,820 --> 03:08:42,100
I got

2211
03:08:47,020 --> 03:09:14,000
the trigger finger my trigger finger oh my god I'm not patient I think the judges are much more patient than me see you see this is why I didn't pick I didn't pick the the last three winners it would not have been I if I had played 200 138 games.

2212
03:09:14,580 --> 03:09:16,800
I would not have been past the first level.

2213
03:09:18,720 --> 03:09:19,400
I...

2214
03:09:19,400 --> 03:09:24,460
There we go.

2215
03:09:28,960 --> 03:09:29,400
Okay.

2216
03:09:50,950 --> 03:09:51,390
All right.

2217
03:09:59,920 --> 03:10:00,900
We got this.

2218
03:10:09,040 --> 03:10:11,060
Move that block to the left.

2219
03:10:12,420 --> 03:10:13,380
Oh my god.

2220
03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:13,660
Wait.

2221
03:10:16,320 --> 03:10:19,160
Oh my god, wait, did I make that harder for myself?

2222
03:10:19,740 --> 03:10:27,180
Oh my god, you mean I could have done that this entire time instead of making the tightest jump of my fucking life?

2223
03:10:29,840 --> 03:10:32,240
Okay, but it would have been so cool if I made it though.

2224
03:10:33,700 --> 03:10:36,080
But guys, it would have been so fucking cool if I made it.

2225
03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:39,640
That's...

2226
03:10:59,140 --> 03:11:00,140
Give me a sec.

2227
03:11:00,320 --> 03:11:01,540

What the fuck?

2243
03:14:06,280 --> 03:14:08,920
Wait, wait, wait.

2244
03:14:09,950 --> 03:14:12,930

I thought I could.

2255
03:15:12,480 --> 03:15:14,380
I thought I could break it.

2256
03:15:18,770 --> 03:15:20,590
I have like one of each.

2257
03:15:24,180 --> 03:15:25,900

I bet they asked the devs the answer.

2265
03:16:28,550 --> 03:16:28,770
There's no...

2266
03:16:28,770 --> 03:16:31,030

03:26:51,580 --> 03:27:04,400
Alright, we did it I figured it out this level took me 25 minutes of late Because the levels got what?

2347
03:27:04,780 --> 03:27:08,060
How is I supposed to know you put two buttons together?

2348
03:27:08,340 --> 03:27:09,540
It cancels it out.

2349
03:27:09,980 --> 03:27:12,000
Alright, what is this level called?

2350
03:27:12,400 --> 03:27:13,960

03:27:14,300 --> 03:27:15,920
Okay, the final goon.

Thank you.

2357
03:27:25,380 --> 03:27:28,440
I wonder if there were more solutions.

2358
03:27:35,780 --> 03:27:39,480
Yes, Tokyo, you did such a thing.

2359
03:27:39,900 --> 03:27:42,880

I just...

2373
03:28:55,340 --> 03:28:56,780

2374
03:28:56,960 --> 03:28:58,880

2375
03:28:58,880 --> 03:29:00,400
Oh my god.

2376
03:29:03,060 --> 03:29:03,720
Okay.

2377
03:29:09,100 --> 03:29:11,700
I assume I have to block it, right?

2378
03:29:14,460 --> 03:29:15,500
Oh my god.

2379
03:29:15,740 --> 03:29:16,800
For God, he hurts me.

2380
03:29:25,960 --> 03:29:27,360
Okay.

2381
03:29:31,300 --> 03:29:32,700
Okay.

2382
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,420
Oh my god, please.

2383
03:29:47,840 --> 03:29:48,320
Please.

2384
03:29:49,480 --> 03:29:50,180
Okay.

2385
03:30:05,110 --> 03:30:07,730
I don't know what I'm doing I

2386
03:30:12,120 --> 03:30:28,500

2387
03:30:47,210 --> 03:30:49,210
Oh my God, you whore.

2388
03:30:49,990 --> 03:30:51,370
You add to a whore.

2389
03:31:00,130 --> 03:31:00,990
Eventually.

2390
03:31:04,390 --> 03:31:04,810
Eventually.

2391
03:31:05,270 --> 03:31:07,130
I just gotta angle it correctly.

2392
03:31:11,290 --> 03:31:11,430
Oh!

2393
03:31:22,250 --> 03:31:22,680

2394
03:31:23,180 --> 03:31:24,420
Please give me a...

2395
03:31:24,440 --> 03:31:25,740

2396
03:31:28,180 --> 03:31:28,900
I'm refreshing!

2397
03:31:35,200 --> 03:31:38,680
I'm doing call it dragon.

2398
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:41,420
Call it dragon.

2399
03:31:51,460 --> 03:31:54,000
Alan, I need any dragon.

2400
03:31:54,400 --> 03:31:55,980
I demand the solution, right?

2401
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:56,220
now.

2402
03:31:56,540 --> 03:32:02,700
If I don't get a solution, when I do a countdown of five, this game goes to sixth place.

2403
03:32:03,080 --> 03:32:07,220
I am making an executive order right now.

2404
03:32:11,180 --> 03:32:13,780
I'm giving a count of five.

2405
03:32:14,200 --> 03:32:22,720
And if I refresh and I don't see the solution, this game is going to sixth place and I'm bumping everyone up.

2406
03:32:23,100 --> 03:32:25,580
I, it wouldn't happen.

2407
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:29,180
I am, this is a hostage situation.

2408
03:32:29,440 --> 03:32:30,320
This is...

2409
03:32:32,500 --> 03:32:41,500
Five, four, three, two, one.

2410
03:32:47,970 --> 03:32:49,970
All right, I'll give you, like, three more seconds.

2411
03:32:50,290 --> 03:32:52,350
I know a solution.

2412
03:32:52,990 --> 03:32:54,810
Use your brain.

2413
03:32:56,930 --> 03:32:57,850
Three.

2414
03:32:59,190 --> 03:33:02,290
I expected like a fucking picture by now.

2415
03:33:02,550 --> 03:33:04,770
To be fair, I did not try to do it.

2416
03:33:05,110 --> 03:33:06,130
You won't.

2417
03:33:06,710 --> 03:33:09,310
That's why I said thank you in the super chat.

2418
03:33:09,390 --> 03:33:09,770
Thank you.

2419
03:33:09,870 --> 03:33:10,510
Thank you.

2420
03:33:10,630 --> 03:33:13,170
I literally assumed you guys would have posted it.

2421
03:33:13,250 --> 03:33:15,390
I was like, all right, that's it.

2422
03:33:15,710 --> 03:33:16,110
All right.

2423
03:33:16,510 --> 03:33:17,810
Executive order.

2424
03:33:19,630 --> 03:33:20,750
No negotiation.

2425
03:33:21,550 --> 03:33:21,930
All right.

2426
03:33:22,870 --> 03:33:23,990
Executive order.

2427
03:33:24,770 --> 03:33:25,830
Right now.

2428
03:33:26,450 --> 03:33:26,930
All right.

2429
03:33:29,190 --> 03:34:54,630
I think we're all stuck here with the power with the power of the executive order this game is now sixth place the fifth the last the previous fifth is I'm I'm sorry I you have successfully rage baited me and it's okay it's still the same prize money but I I just can't beat it I can't beat it I can't don't worry because she's just salty she's dumb anyway so the other games they're now four fifth this game is now sixth place and whose fault is that it's it just wasn't toky proof and because of that i had to make my executive order all right i'll do i'll try i'll try try one more time i don't think anyone has beat it you have forgot to doky improved this game.

2430
03:34:55,570 --> 03:34:57,510
I'll have to demote you.

2431
03:34:58,290 --> 03:35:01,170
A truly amazing game right here.

2432
03:35:01,670 --> 03:35:02,030
Zomber.

2433
03:35:02,210 --> 03:35:03,730

Thank you.

2436
03:35:08,170 --> 03:35:09,670
I can do it.

2437
03:35:10,110 --> 03:35:11,150
I've given up.

2438
03:35:11,250 --> 03:35:13,290
I've lost all hope and humanity.

2439
03:35:14,390 --> 03:35:15,190
I...

2440
03:35:17,450 --> 03:35:18,250
I...

2441
03:35:18,250 --> 03:35:18,350
I...

2442
03:35:20,190 --> 03:35:21,730
I can't...

2443
03:35:22,950 --> 03:35:24,490
Just end me.

2444
03:35:25,590 --> 03:35:26,950
I wish I could just...

2445
03:35:26,950 --> 03:35:27,450
Oh, I...

2446
03:35:27,450 --> 03:35:31,390
Oh, the fucking whips can kill me, but I can't do it if I do this.

2447
03:35:31,770 --> 03:35:32,290
I...

2448
03:35:32,290 --> 03:35:33,250
Oh, my God.

2449
03:35:33,670 --> 03:35:33,970
Nice.

2450
03:35:34,110 --> 03:35:34,730
Okay, wait.

2451
03:35:35,110 --> 03:35:37,550
My executive order right here.

2452
03:35:38,030 --> 03:35:38,230
Wait.

2453
03:35:39,510 --> 03:35:39,890
Oops.

2454
03:35:40,990 --> 03:35:41,690
This is how...

2455
03:35:41,690 --> 03:35:43,050
This is how I'm ending things.

2456
03:35:43,950 --> 03:35:45,310
If I can't.

2457
03:35:45,570 --> 03:35:46,010
Please.

2458
03:35:46,850 --> 03:35:47,610
Oh, my God.

2459
03:35:47,650 --> 03:35:48,510
It was right there.

2460
03:35:48,530 --> 03:35:50,730
I could have ended right here.

2461
03:35:50,730 --> 03:35:58,870
I had the perfect angle Where it actually hits me

2462
03:36:03,470 --> 03:36:22,130

03:36:28,970 --> 03:36:30,410

2466
03:36:30,830 --> 03:36:32,350

2467
03:36:32,510 --> 03:36:34,530

03:36:38,170 --> 03:36:42,690
Just just take me out and take me out.

2469
03:36:46,010 --> 03:36:47,510

2488
03:39:28,110 --> 03:39:32,970

I don't know how to see it.

2490
03:39:36,090 --> 03:39:38,930
I don't know how to beat this level.

2491
03:39:40,690 --> 03:39:43,990
Sneaking like a real duchess.
