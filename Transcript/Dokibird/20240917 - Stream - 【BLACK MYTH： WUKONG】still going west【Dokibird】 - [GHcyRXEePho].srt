1
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,480
Guys, I'm a little bit of a mess right now.

2
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,120
I don't know a way to open up a stream.

3
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,960
Guys, I'm waiting for my food right now.

4
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm so hungry.

5
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
Hello everybody!

6
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,680
Hello!

7
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,060
Anyway, so for those of you who didn't read on the pinned message...

8
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,340
I ordered lasagna today because I was like...

9
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,080
You know what?

10
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,120
I'm going to treat myself.

11
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,720
Because I had...

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,020
Because dad here...

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,580
Somebody's moving in again.

14
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,540
Moving in today.

15
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,060
So he woke me up like three times.

16
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,500
He woke me up three times.

17
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,840
And then I found out today...

18
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,520
I found out...

19
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,500
I was like... I had a package.

20
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,140
I didn't realize I ordered something.

21
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,940
And then I found out that the package...

22
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,880
arrived at my old place.

23
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,000
So then I called.

24
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,000
And I was like...

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,880
Hey, I used to live here.

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,160
This is my name and this is my...

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,840
The unit I used to live in.

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
And like...

29
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,580
Do you have a package for me?

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,780
And then they're like...

31
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,360
Let me check.

32
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,140
And they're like...

33
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,520
No!

34
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,900
I'm like...

35
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,960
Oh, okay.

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,820
So I was like...

37
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,780
Time to order lasagna and eat my feelings.

38
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,320
I was like... You know what?

39
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,760
That's too much to start the day.

40
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,700
I'm going to...

41
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,600
I'm going to order lasagna.

42
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,340
That's too much.

43
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,060
So, yes.

44
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,020
Today I'm getting lasagna.

45
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,520
I'm not going to eat my bread supply.

46
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,000
Which I put the bread in the freezer, guys.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,280
So, like, I still have a lot of bread.

48
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,120
And I...

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,540
I bought too much bread, guys.

50
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,360
I'm already so over it.

51
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,680
I was like...

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,120
Wait.

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,220
Even though bread...

54
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,160
Like, you know, even though it was like, you know...

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,700
Nice bread.

56
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,040
Like...

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,640
They sort of taste the same.

58
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,180
I was like...

59
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,400
Wow, all this bread...

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
Just tastes like all the other bread.

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,040
It's just bread.

62
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,800
I was like...

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,440
Yeah, there's different flavor bread.

64
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,880
But, like, deep down, it's just...

65
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,860
The bread taste.

66
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,740
And I was like...

67
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,760
Why did I buy two bags of bread?

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,520
I guess I just haven't had...

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,600
I just haven't had, like, freshly baked bread in a long time.

70
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,700
So...

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,220
So, like, I don't know what came over me.

72
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,880
I don't...

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,460
Oh, my God.

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,240
They all look so good, but they all sort of taste the same.

75
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,100
It's just...

76
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,180
It doesn't matter.

77
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,760
Yeah.

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,660
Anyway, so...

79
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,900
It's gonna arrive in, like, 10 minutes.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,920
Okay, let me double check.

81
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm gonna stop moving for a little bit.

82
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,540
Um...

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,900
Let me double check real...

84
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,380
Oh, yeah, sorry.

85
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,520
I'm loading in.

86
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,720
I wanna make sure it is coming at 1245.

87
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,580
If it is...

88
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,560
Okay, yes, it's still 1245.

89
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,320
Alright, at 1245, I'm out.

90
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,680
Anyway, today...

91
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,380
Today, I walked dad today.

92
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,720
And...

93
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,640
Um...

94
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,940
Oh, my God, every day he reminds me of how much he's such a little shit.

95
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,460
Like...

96
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,800
So...

97
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,120
So, today...

98
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,700
Today, while I was walking him...

99
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,600
We bumped into this, like...

100
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,500
We were, like, waiting to cross the street.

101
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,580
And then...

102
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,240
And then...

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,740
You guys all know...

104
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,940
He only likes women.

105
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,600
He hates men.

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,400
He does not like men.

107
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,940
Of any height.

108
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,460
So, it doesn't...

109
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,740
And children, too.

110
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,860
So, he's traumatized, like, one or two kids since I moved here.

111
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,180
Because, like...

112
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,360
I couldn't get him...

113
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,680
Like, you know, the child would, like, walk past me during the lobby.

114
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,640
And then he'll be like...

115
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,480
Like, he'll be like, tiny dog.

116
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,040
So...

117
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,300
So, he hates... No, he does.

118
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,600
He hates the kids and the elderly.

119
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:12,780
And...

120
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,260
So, whenever I see a child, I, like, make sure...

121
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,260
Like, we walk a different direction.

122
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,760
So, he doesn't see the child.

123
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,400
Or, like, he doesn't get close to the child.

124
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Because I didn't want to traumatize kids, you know?

125
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,280
Because I'm like...

126
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,840
We live in the same building.

127
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,520
And I'm worried that, like, I'm gonna bump into you again.

128
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,420
And then you're gonna blame me...

129
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,180
For giving your kids trauma...

130
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,260
And therapy lessons.

131
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,260
Because they can't handle dogs anymore.

132
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,400
Because I don't want that to be on me.

133
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,620
And I'm worried there.

134
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,120
So...

135
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,640
So...

136
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,860
No, sometimes I pick him up.

137
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,340
And sometimes I just make sure...

138
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,140
He doesn't get close to the children.

139
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,520
So, he's only traumatized...

140
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,540
One or two child now.

141
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,580
One of them cried.

142
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,540
I was... I felt so bad.

143
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,520
I was like...

144
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,880
I am so sorry.

145
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,100
I'm so sorry.

146
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,620
I'm so sorry.

147
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,640
So...

148
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,520
One cried.

149
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,620
One didn't.

150
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,340
So, like, I count that as a win.

151
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,620
In terms of, like, I didn't traumatize that many children.

152
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,380
Like, since moving here.

153
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,160
So...

154
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm worried for you too.

155
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,440
Because it's my birthday!

156
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:22,900
Sorry!

157
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,360
Thank you!

158
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,820
Thank you!

159
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,280
Happy birthday to you!

160
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,120
Happy birthday to you!

161
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,940
Yeah!

162
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,420
Happy birthday dear SoulOrd!

163
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,940
Happy birthday to you!

164
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah!

165
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,320
So...

166
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,180
So...

167
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,360
Basically...

168
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,020
We had that issue.

169
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,400
We're working on that issue.

170
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,700
We're working on it.

171
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,820
Anyway...

172
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,380
Other than that...

173
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,280
So...

174
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,980
He also hates men, children, and the elderly.

175
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,520
But he loves women.

176
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,760
So...

177
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,300
He loves ladies.

178
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,520
So basically...

179
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,840
While I was taking him for a walk today...

180
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,740
This morning...

181
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,680
There was a couple in front of me while waiting to cross the street with me.

182
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,400
And then...

183
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,760
He was very interested in the lady.

184
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,900
And so he was, like, sniffing her leg.

185
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,560
And was like...

186
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,760
Yeah!

187
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:15,840
Lady!

188
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,200
And then the guy noticed it.

189
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,520
And he was the one that was like...

190
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,400
Oh, dog!

191
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,120
And he was like...

192
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,920
What a cute dog!

193
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,980
Like, the lady didn't acknowledge him.

194
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,460
But the guy did.

195
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
So that the guy was like...

196
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,200
Hello there!

197
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,660
And then he stick out his hand.

198
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,660
And was like...

199
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,680
And then Doki Amber Doge walked up.

200
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,660
Sniffed his hand.

201
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,220
I thought it was a good encounter.

202
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,860
I thought he was going to be okay.

203
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,740
Because he didn't seem like too...

204
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,720
He didn't seem aggressive.

205
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,120
And then he, like, sniffed his hand.

206
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,020
And was like...

207
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,920
He tried to nip his hand.

208
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,120
And, like, a warning nip.

209
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,340
And then started barking at him.

210
00:08:59,380 --> 00:08:59,740
I was like...

211
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,500
You sniffed his hand!

212
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,980
He didn't bite anybody.

213
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,700
He was, like, pretend bite.

214
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,120
You know?

215
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,840
Like he was posturing.

216
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,040
He was like...

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,460
And then he started barking at him.

218
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,140
And he was like...

219
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,360
Whoa!

220
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,460
And I was like...

221
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,120
Are you serious?

222
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,760
And I was like...

223
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,700
I was like...

224
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,360
Dad, no!

225
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,860
And I'm like... I'm sorry!

226
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,920
I'm so sorry!

227
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,460
And he's like... No, it's okay.

228
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,600
Because I was like... Why did you approach him?

229
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,860
And you don't like him!

230
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,020
I'm just...

231
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,640
You're not a lady...

232
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,980
He's like... He sniffs the hand.

233
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,500
And you're like... You're no lady!

234
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,480
Get out!

235
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,080
He's just like...

236
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,940
Lady hands only!

237
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,180
Because if it's a woman...

238
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,820
He wouldn't do that.

239
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,940
Like, you know...

240
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,360
I'd go on the walks and then like...

241
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,880
A lady would come up and be like...

242
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,660
Aww, cute dog!

243
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,900
And then he would be like...

244
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,280
Yay!

245
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,060
And then he would be like...

246
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,000
Yay, pet me!

247
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,240
Oh my god!

248
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,580
Give me love and attention!

249
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,240
But if it's a man...

250
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,320
He would not!

251
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,360
He could smell the testosterone.

252
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,680
If it's a man...

253
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,880
Then back off!

254
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
But then he always gives them like...

255
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,000
A false sense of security.

256
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,380
That's like the worst part.

257
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,720
He pretends that he's okay.

258
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,980
And then he lets them get close to him.

259
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,260
And like...

260
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,880
He would sniff the hand.

261
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
And then when he smells them...

262
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,800
He's like... No!

263
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,820
He's like...

264
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,640
Wait a minute.

265
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,440
You're no lady.

266
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,400
Why did I let you approach me?

267
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,020
Anyway...

268
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,580
But yes, that is how...

269
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,420
This is... God damn it.

270
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,080
I don't know where he gets this from.

271
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,120
I don't know where he...

272
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,360
I don't know why he hates men!

273
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,680
And children!

274
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,060
And the elderly!

275
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,220
And the elderly!

276
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,380
I don't know why!

277
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,660
I don't know why!

278
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,200
He just likes women!

279
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,620
He doesn't care about anything else!

280
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,660
Anyway...

281
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
That's basically...

282
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,080
Life update today.

283
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,440
That's my...

284
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,720
That's my life update for the day.

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,040
That's my life update for the day.

286
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,780
Um...

287
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,540
Oh yeah, by the way, have you guys seen the eSports GeoGuessr World Cup?

288
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,260
I heard about that going on in the background.

289
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,460
But like...

290
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,460
I didn't watch the stream of it.

291
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,540
Yeah, they had a GeoGuessr World Cup.

292
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,220
It was like eSports.

293
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,920
Wait, some of you guys didn't see it?

294
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,540
It was crazy!

295
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,260
I watched the...

296
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,440
I watched the VOD of it and they were like...

297
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,720
They were commentating on it as if it's like a real...

298
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,420
It's so intense.

299
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,460
Like the eSport of GeoGuessr.

300
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,360
Holy shit!

301
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,900
Like they actually had like...

302
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,860
Sportscasters and stuff.

303
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,780
Like eSportcasters doing it.

304
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,620
It was so fucking crazy!

305
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,620
You guys have to...

306
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll show you guys the...

307
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,920
You guys have to watch the...

308
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,920
Like people!

309
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,620
Like the...

310
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,940
The sportscasting for it was insane.

311
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm just gonna show you.

312
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,360
Yeah, it was...

313
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,020
It literally happened like...

314
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,400
Two days ago.

315
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:42,980
The finals.

316
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,340
But it was actually insane.

317
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,080
Like how crazy it was.

318
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,760
Yeah, like I was like...

319
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,360
I guess I heard about it, but I didn't watch it.

320
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,900
Okay, let me...

321
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,640
My food might be here.

322
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,160
Oh shit!

323
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay, it's here!

324
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,640
I'll be right back!

325
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,380
I'm back.

326
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,380
I'm back with my lasagna.

327
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,820
Okay, give me a sec.

328
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,240
Let me...

329
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,520
I'm sorry guys.

330
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,520
This is just...

331
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,900
This ends up being like a...

332
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,780
Fucking...

333
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,960
This is eating...

334
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,000
Eating stream.

335
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,300
Give me a sec.

336
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,960
Please let me eat.

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,580
Okay.

338
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,300
There we go.

339
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,480
Oh my god.

340
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,260
Lasagna!

341
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,500
Yay!

342
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,360
Got my lasagna!

343
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,820
Let's go!

344
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,760
Oh my god.

345
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,020
I'm so happy.

346
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm so happy.

347
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,380
Oh, I knew they wouldn't fucking give me a fork.

348
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,480
Even though I requested utensils.

349
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,340
I don't understand!

350
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,900
I just wanted a fork!

351
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,960
Yay!

352
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,340
Oh my god, it's so hot!

353
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,900
This has to be fresh lasagna!

354
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,520
This better be fucking fresh lasagna!

355
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,060
I waited like... Oh, they did give me a fork.

356
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,060
It's a wooden fork.

357
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,880
I fucking... Okay.

358
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,020
Save the environment.

359
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,040
But fuck, I hate the wooden forks.

360
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,440
God damn it.

361
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,420
This better be fresh lasagna.

362
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,760
This took an hour.

363
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,900
This took an hour to get here.

364
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,980
This better be fresh as fuck.

365
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,660
Literally, the restaurant was dedicated to just lasagna.

366
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,260
God, it has to be a ghost kitchen.

367
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:36,960
Oh my god.

368
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,300
Now that I think about it.

369
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,380
Why was it just lasagna?

370
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,320
That doesn't seem very like...

371
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,800
This better be like...

372
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,840
This better not be a ghost kitchen.

373
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,940
This better not be a ghost kitchen.

374
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,580
Okay.

375
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,920
Yogi has the most real voice I've ever heard in a...

376
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,420
Yogi has the most real voice I've ever heard in a...

377
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,160
I've ever heard in a VTuber because this is my real voice.

378
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,940
I can't...

379
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,200
I can't fake a voice.

380
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,600
It would fuck with me.

381
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,320
No!

382
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,840
And also the jalapeno pepper poppers too.

383
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,420
No!

384
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,350
No food.

385
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,910
You can't have human food.

386
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,790
Okay?

387
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,650
Oh my god, it looks so good.

388
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,550
Oh my god, I haven't had lasagna in so long.

389
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,970
Oh my gosh.

390
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,730
I'm going to be just like my hero.

391
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,850
Oh my god, I'm going to be just like my hero.

392
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,710
Oh my god, I'm going to be just like my hero.

393
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,790
I haven't had lasagna in so long.

394
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,290
God, please be good.

395
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,330
Please be good.

396
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,530
I waited an hour for this.

397
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,210
You know mukbang?

398
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:08,870
The reason why mukbang is so popular is because it actually makes it so that you're not as hungry when you watch and listen to other people eat.

399
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,870
I don't know if it actually works if like, you know, you don't see the food in front of you.

400
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,550
You don't see the food in front of you.

401
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,330
People like used to watch mukbang because it's like it helps deter hunger or something.

402
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:34,010
So I don't know if that's like I don't know if that's like actually a thing because I don't I personally I'm always two steps ahead.

403
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,370
That shit was great.

404
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,090
That's so...

405
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,410
That is psychopathic behavior.

406
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,630
I'm sorry.

407
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,910
Like if you guys didn't know what's his name?

408
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,510
Nico Avocado or whatever.

409
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,630
That shit is psychopathic.

410
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,510
Like I'm sorry.

411
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,390
Like that's crazy.

412
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,090
The Avocadoman.

413
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:03,050
So for those who don't know, there was this guy that was famous for making drama and like causing drama like almost every week.

414
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:12,310
And he was extremely, extremely overweight to the point where like people were actually concerned about his health.

415
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:28,850
And then, but what apparently what happened was that he was, he pre-recorded videos for two, like he pre-recorded two years worth of videos on three different channels.

416
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,570
And then just spent the whole time just losing weight.

417
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,710
And losing weight in every thing.

418
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,970
And I was, and like but like I'm just like, that's that's fucking crazy.

419
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,590
Like I was like why?

420
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,080
For two years, like two years.

421
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,300
He has three different channels by the way, which he updated regularly.

422
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,480
Like I mean, people would be like, wow that's like fucking crazy.

423
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,460
Like that, that like he actually that was like good, I guess like content wise.

424
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,640
That's pretty fucking crazy.

425
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,040
But it is crazy.

426
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
That shit is crazy.

427
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,180
Imagine if all these videos, all these streams were pre-recorded.

428
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,000
Like two years worth and I just come back.

429
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,600
Two steps ahead.

430
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,040
Like I come back as a new person.

431
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,700
Two steps ahead.

432
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,340
All these streams and all these videos you saw.

433
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:38,200
And like and then the fact that like he was able to make sure that zero dates were anywhere.

434
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,660
Like I assume he like changed the dates on his phones too.

435
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,900
And everything to make it work.

436
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,520
It's just crazy.

437
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:59,500
Yeah, like I don't know what like like I don't know.

438
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,500
It's just I don't know.

439
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,120
Like couldn't he just IMO?

440
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,440
I'm just like couldn't he just you know like document himself losing weight?

441
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,440
I feel like people would enjoy that more cause you're like being healthier on like

442
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,000
Not the whole like gotcha.

443
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,360
The gotcha moment and everything.

444
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,800
This is a really good lasagna by the way.

445
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,400
I'm trying to make sure he doesn't fucking.

446
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm trying.

447
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:37,020
I'm ignoring him cause if I give him what he wants then he'll know that if he barks he'll get food and I don't want that.

448
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,380
So I'm trying to teach him a lesson.

449
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,580
That he can't Barking does not solve everything.

450
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,160
The barking is pre-recorded.

451
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,320
I don't think mukbangs.

452
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,300
Oh by the way I don't think mukbangs are popular anymore.

453
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,960
I don't know if people actually still watch mukbangs.

454
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,060
Those were like a 2010 trend.

455
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:09,830
I feel like I don't even know what newest like internet trend now.

456
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,110
Hmm Oh yeah did you guys see the minecraft?

457
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,350
I know I like I'm like late to the party.

458
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,170
I saw the minecraft trailer when it came out.

459
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,210
That shit looked like ass.

460
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:38,790
But Like I don't know what to say other than like it's crazy that Jack Black has now in just two movies and just like within like two to three months Jack Black's reputation has tanked so much.

461
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:51,530
Um In like in like three to four months it literally tanked so hard like it's actually he fell off so hard I don't

462
00:25:54,790 --> 00:26:09,970
In two to three months it's like it's actually so sad it's so sad like everybody loved him and then two to three months it just bad news keep coming over and over and over.

463
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:25,670
Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hmm If I'm Mario that's last year I cannot wait to watch Borderlands with you guys though cannot wait

464
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:49,130
it's because like people are casting him as Jack Black let's say Chris Pratt first so instead of him playing character cause at least in Mario he played Bowser you know he played Okay, Bowser, but Kung Fu Panda 4... okay.

465
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,850
Guys, no, you do not...

466
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,510
Kung Fu Panda 4 is not a good representation.

467
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:03,190
If anything, it just backs up my claim.

468
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,610
All I'm saying is that...

469
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,990
they're now doing a thing with Chris Pratt...

470
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,610
and Awkwafina.

471
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,450
God, I hate Awkwafina.

472
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,370
I used to like her...

473
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,950
until every time they casted her...

474
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,790
she's just playing herself.

475
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,450
I used to like her stuff.

476
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,710
But then, literally...

477
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,770
I hate that...

478
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,940
every time they get Awkwafina...

479
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,590
they just make her play Awkwafina.

480
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,890
Like, I'm just like...

481
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:53,850
please.

482
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,890
She's a good actress.

483
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,870
She's actually a really good actress.

484
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,010
I actually went to a theater to watch the one...

485
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,090
that movie where she...

486
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,010
that one that got nominated for an Oscar...

487
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,230
about her going back to...

488
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,070
going back to Asia to visit her grandma...

489
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,150
who was dying...

490
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,970
who got like...

491
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:16,810
who got cancer.

492
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,910
And like...

493
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,530
The Farewell.

494
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,270
Yes, The Farewell.

495
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,010
That movie was so good.

496
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,090
I actually watched it.

497
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,170
I really liked The Farewell.

498
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,650
And it's such a good movie.

499
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,750
But like...

500
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,370
and then...

501
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,990
but they keep casting her as like...

502
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,310
herself.

503
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,410
And it's like...

504
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,310
I'm just sad.

505
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:32,870
Cause like...

506
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:33,890
Awkwafina...

507
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,470
I feel like she's a really good actress.

508
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,010
But...

509
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,230
she's just...

510
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,570
get casted and like...

511
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,070
as herself.

512
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,130
Which is like Chris Pratt.

513
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,810
I fucking hate the Chris Pratt syndrome.

514
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,690
Where they just cast actors and actresses...

515
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,150
as themselves.

516
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,590
And I'm tired of that.

517
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,270
Yeah, she gets typecasted.

518
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,030
And like...

519
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,750
that's what's happening to Jack Black right now.

520
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,570
He's literally getting casted as himself.

521
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,670
Like how is that Steve?

522
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,930
It's literally just Jack Black with a blue shirt.

523
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,470
And it's like two blue shirts?

524
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,550
I...

525
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:16,870
I...

526
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,990
I don't understand the costume.

527
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,530
It's like a V-neck...

528
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,370
sweater.

529
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,750
And then underneath is another shirt.

530
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,310
Like...

531
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,810
I don't understand.

532
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,070
Like...

533
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,130
why is he wearing two shirts?

534
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,250
Why?

535
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,570
Why is he wearing two shirts?

536
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,790
Like...

537
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,370
it's a V-neck, but like...

538
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,410
there's a shirt underneath the V-neck?

539
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:39,990
Like...

540
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,500
Somebody made a...

541
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,120
Lego parody...

542
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,160
of the trailer...

543
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,060
and it looked really good.

544
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,060
I...

545
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,040
I wish like...

546
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,520
um...

547
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,320
I wish that like...

548
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,740
the main character...

549
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:18,380
The Minecraft movie was like blocky like the Lego movie, but not like Minecraft animation, because I personally think like the Minecraft and I know there's someone made like a Minecraft parody of it, like Minecraft animation, but like, I think the Lego one looked so much better.

550
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,300
Um, yeah.

551
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:32,820
And then like, Pharoah Williams is making a Lego movie of his own fucking life, which I thought looked really interesting.

552
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,560
I don't know if you guys saw the trailer for it.

553
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:43,640
But, you know, Pharoah Williams, the one that made all the Despicable Me songs, like, that's the question and happy.

554
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,720
Yeah, he's making like a biopic pic, but he's making it all in Lego.

555
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,940
Like he's doing like, Lego animation for it.

556
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,040
Yeah, it looked really cool.

557
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:59,900
And then he has like all these like big famous rappers, like an actual interviews, but like, they're like Lego.

558
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,280
So like, there's like, like Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, like, they're all like Lego.

559
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,020
So funny.

560
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,200
This is so funny.

561
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,540
I saw, I saw the trailer for it looked really interesting.

562
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,440
Like all these famous rappers.

563
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,560
Just doing it.

564
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,760
Like they don't didn't know they were gonna be in Lego too.

565
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,720
So it's really silly.

566
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,260
Hmm.

567
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,530
This is a really good lasagna.

568
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,510
God, it's gonna be so sad.

569
00:31:52,650 --> 00:32:00,710
If it was like because it was like, It was like literally a restaurant that just sold lasagna, so I was like, oh no, did I order from a ghost kitchen?

570
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:06,990
But like even if this is a ghost kitchen, this is pretty decent lasagna for a ghost kitchen.

571
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,190
Lego Loki becoming like Disney, that is such a huge insult to Lego.

572
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,710
We don't want anything to become like Disney.

573
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,550
Did you hear that Pixar?

574
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,410
What was it?

575
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:35,510
Inside Out 2 became the number one animated movie, top grossing animated movie, which I was very surprised.

576
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,910
I watched Inside Out 2.

577
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,890
It was not that good.

578
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,670
Like I was good, but like not that good.

579
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:51,110
It was good, but not that good.

580
00:32:51,430 --> 00:33:03,010
Also like number two was fucking The Lion King, the live action movie, which was not live action, but like the live action slash animated movie was Lion King.

581
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,270
That's number two.

582
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,930
I was like, what?

583
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,190
I was so surprised.

584
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,780
Inflation, yeah.

585
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,780
They don't take into account of inflation.

586
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,500
So that's why it was like number two.

587
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:35,000
But like, oh my god, like Inside Out 2 is just Inside Out 1.

588
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,220
But they introduced like it's literally the same movie.

589
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,700
It's the same movie.

590
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,200
It's like it's the same plot and everything.

591
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,580
It's the same plot.

592
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,780
It's literally the same plot.

593
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,540
Like anxiety, it was joy in Inside Out 1.

594
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,260
They didn't learn anything from the first movie.

595
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:24,760
And then, but the thing is, like Inside Out 2 became the highest grossing animated movie of all time.

596
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:36,740
But then, Pixar fired like a lot of their staff during the production of Inside Out 2.

597
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,140
That's fucked.

598
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,260
And they didn't get health insurance.

599
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,280
I was like, what the fucked?!

600
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,240
I read that, I was like, that's so fucked!

601
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,980
Inside Out 2 became the highest grossing animated movie.

602
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,400
And like a portion of the staff that worked on that movie got fired.

603
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,720
And it didn't even get health insurance or like, what is it, like the package that you get from the people.

604
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,140
If you get fired, you get like a package or whatever.

605
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,360
Sorry, I don't have a real job.

606
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:15,920
I'm sorry.

607
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,360
Severance package, yeah.

608
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,060
They didn't get a severance right after they got fired.

609
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,980
So people were like, how the fuck did Inside Out 2 become the highest-grossing anime movie?

610
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:34,880
And some of the staff that worked on it didn't even get severance pay.

611
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,920
Like, they made so much money off of that.

612
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,360
Welcome to Corpa.

613
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,700
I know.

614
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,940
Yeah.

615
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,640
Apparently, like, Disney working condition has not been great lately.

616
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,840
Well, it's been not great for a couple of fucking years.

617
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,240
I'm not surprised.

618
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,120
That's so wrong.

619
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,940
It's so wrong.

620
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,820
It is.

621
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,500
It's actually so messed up.

622
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,820
But it's also, like, the industry, too.

623
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,760
Tech industry got overloaded because of COVID.

624
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:24,740
So a lot of companies that use technology, especially game development and, like, game development, animation, all that.

625
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,360
A lot of them overhired.

626
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,140
And after COVID was over, like, so many people got fired.

627
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,100
It's so fucked, I feel like.

628
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,100
Mm-hmm.

629
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,680
Yeah, there's been so many layoffs.

630
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,300
I heard, like, especially in game development, too.

631
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,060
Because people, like, overhired so much for anything with regarding tech.

632
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,330
Yeah.

633
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,370
Society.

634
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,160
I mean, Microsoft shut down game companies for no reason.

635
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,000
Like...

636
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,660
Like, nobody knows why they shut down the companies.

637
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,160
They shut down the company for Hi-Fi Rush.

638
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,740
They never gave, like, a reason for it.

639
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,060
They were just, like, we're shutting them down.

640
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,380
Like, I don't know.

641
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,920
I was like, what?

642
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,060
They made money.

643
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:50,580
They're just, like, anyway, we're shutting down the company that, like, you know, they won some awards or whatever.

644
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,880
But we're gonna shut them down.

645
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,140
I get it.

646
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,280
And then...

647
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,380
Thank God.

648
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,880
Thank God PUBG bought them, though.

649
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,160
Thank God.

650
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:01,820
PUBG...

651
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,360
At least PUBG bought the rights.

652
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,580
So, they're now owned by PUBG.

653
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,980
Which I thought was pretty funny, too.

654
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,240
That Hi-Fi Rush is now owned by PUBG.

655
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,960
Tax write-off bullshit should not be a thing.

656
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,360
This is why we don't get the Wile E.

657
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,180
Coyote movie.

658
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,500
It shouldn't be a thing.

659
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,840
I'm thinking... I feel like...

660
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,460
There's no reason to be...

661
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,140
Like...

662
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,560
What are you gonna do with being...

663
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,140
Like...

664
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,060
Oh, boo-hoo.

665
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,860
I'm gonna be less of a millionaire now.

666
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,540
And I'm like, you're not even...

667
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,360
You're gonna, like...

668
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,720
Live all that money?

669
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,400
Die.

670
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,920
And you're still not...

671
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,120
You're still gonna be a millionaire.

672
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,120
It doesn't matter.

673
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,580
Like, this is me.

674
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,360
But, like...

675
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,200
Um...

676
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
I feel like...

677
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,840
I don't understand, like...

678
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,880
Like...

679
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,520
Millionaires slash billionaires.

680
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,500
Cause, like...

681
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,060
They're all about profit, right?

682
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,580
Like, profit, profit, profit.

683
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,940
But, like...

684
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,660
You live your whole life...

685
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,940
You live your whole life off that money.

686
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,580
And, like...

687
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,760
When you die...

688
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
You're still gonna be a millionaire.

689
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,760
Like...

690
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,880
Like, you're still gonna be a millionaire.

691
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,040
You're not gonna be able to...

692
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,680
Spend all that money.

693
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:22,980
Like...

694
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,100
Like...

695
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,180
For my children!

696
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,220
Your kids!

697
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,980
Are gonna be able to spend all that money.

698
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,300
And still gonna be okay.

699
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,260
Like...

700
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,520
They're gonna...

701
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,880
Live off that money.

702
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,600
Die.

703
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,780
And they're still gonna be okay.

704
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,520
Like...

705
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,280
I was like...

706
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,880
And still...

707
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,960
They're still gonna be a millionaire.

708
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,920
So, I never understand, like...

709
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,440
The whole, like...

710
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:42,960
Profit...

711
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,460
Like...

712
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:43,920
Like...

713
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,100
Extreme profit thing.

714
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,380
Um...

715
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,400
What kids...

716
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,060
What...

717
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,720
Oh, sorry.

718
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,460
They need to pay off their...

719
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,760
Like...

720
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:51,780
Like...

721
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,760
Seventh divorce or some shit.

722
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,340
Like...

723
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,440
Bro wants to be on the leaderboards.

724
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,360
You understand, Toki?

725
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,760
Bro needs to be on the top ten leaderboards of billionaires.

726
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,000
Like...

727
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That's why I don't understand.

728
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,320
That's why I don't understand, like...

729
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,940
The...

730
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,740
The...

731
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,220
Um...

732
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,080
How...

733
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,780
Why, like...

734
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,980
Why...

735
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,580
Um...

736
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,100
Certain companies go, like...

737
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,560
Do that.

738
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,040
For, like...

739
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,740
Tax write-offs and shit like that.

740
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,040
Like...

741
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
Getting rid of perfectly good, like...

742
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,680
Video games.

743
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,320
Or...

744
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,960
Com...

745
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,240
Like...

746
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,700
Perfectly...

747
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,480
Okay...

748
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,940
Games and companies.

749
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,040
And, like...

750
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,640
Um...

751
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Movies or whatever.

752
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,480
And they're like...

753
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,160
We gotta...

754
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,960
We gotta have, like...

755
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,500
More profit.

756
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,280
But I'm like...

757
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,940
You guys are fine.

758
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,920
You guys...

759
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,100
You guys are fine.

760
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,180
Like...

761
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,180
Grinding for top 50 in the game of the line.

762
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,400
Bro...

763
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:58,980
You don't understand.

764
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,780
You're so close to top 500 in NA, guys.

765
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,620
You don't understand.

766
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,660
Yeah...

767
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,400
For me, it's like...

768
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,100
As long...

769
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,360
As long...

770
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,460
As, like...

771
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,300
I'm 50...

772
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,900
And I have, like...

773
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,880
A nice place to retire.

774
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,020
Like...

775
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,240
I don't have to care.

776
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,120
I don't have to worry about my health or stuff.

777
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,580
That's all I care about.

778
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,040
Like...

779
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,780
This is my job.

780
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,200
Like...

781
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,940
I'm already...

782
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,230
Like...

783
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,340
Living the best I can live.

784
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,000
Like...

785
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,290
I'm...

786
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,760
I'm literally...

787
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,000
Eating lasagna.

788
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,740
And I just made $10.

789
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,040
Thank you so much.

790
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,840
Giga...

791
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,280
Thank you...

792
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,480
Super chat...

794
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,760
Thank you...

795
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:46,940
Super...

796
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,060
Free...

797
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,980
Free...

798
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,520
Free...

799
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,020
Free...

800
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,120
I'm eating...

801
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,660
Lasagna...

802
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,200
And I just got $10.

803
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,760
Thank you so much.

804
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:02,940
Okay.

805
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,940
I'll put my lasagna away now.

806
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,280
We're actually...

807
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,920
It's been 40...

808
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,340
I'm so sorry for those who are waiting for wukana.

809
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,380
I'm...

810
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,080
I'm so sorry...

811
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
For those waiting for wukana.

812
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,020
Let me put away my lasagna.

813
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,260
Let me put this away.

814
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,360
Oh...

815
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,500
Oh...

816
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,780
Alright, let's see.

817
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,600
I'm sorry for those who don't like ASMR and have to listen to me munch on lasagna.

818
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,380
I'm sorry, but I'm done now.

819
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,080
WUKAN!

820
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,300
Lasagna was pretty good!

821
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,020
I liked it.

822
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,740
I like the lasagna.

823
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,480
I haven't had any for a while.

824
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,280
And like...

825
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,940
I wanted to treat myself today.

826
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,420
So I was like, you know what?

827
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:53,940
Fuck it.

828
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,220
Let's go.

829
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,300
Alright.

830
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,520
I don't remember how to play this game.

831
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,780
So this is gonna be interesting to get back into.

832
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,520
I remember...

833
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,080
Apparently, I'm in the spider village and...

834
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,940
I defeated the yellow dragon.

835
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,840
I don't remember how the controls work anymore.

836
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,460
I think I'm like literally the 1% that uses mouse and keyboard controls.

837
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,340
I like the mouse and keyboard controls.

838
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,000
More than...

839
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,340
I personally like it more than...

840
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,180
More than controller.

841
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,860
Oh yeah, I was here!

842
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,120
Why was I here?

843
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,000
What was I doing here?

844
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,240
Is there upgrades?

845
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,210
Oh yeah, I do!

846
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,090
Nice, okay.

847
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,670
Alright, increased gourd usage.

848
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,770
Yeah, we're increasing our gourd usage.

849
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,350
Alright, store.

850
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:52,650
What's there to buy?

851
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:54,710
Wine worm.

852
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,010
Wine worm.

853
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,270
Oh, it's just for upgrades.

854
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:58,830
Okay.

855
00:43:59,070 --> 00:43:59,950
We don't need that.

856
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,430
We're fine.

857
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:02,930
We're okay.

858
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:03,710
Okay.

859
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:04,550
Uh...

860
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,350
Does he have an update for me?

861
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:10,150
Hello?

862
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,400
Okay, he has no updates.

863
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,060
Oh, nice!

864
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,720
More stuff that I wasn't gonna use.

865
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,480
More stuff that I wasn't gonna use.

866
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,560
More stuff that I wasn't gonna use.

867
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,580
Nice.

868
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,620
More stuff I'm not gonna use in the end.

869
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,040
Guys, you don't understand.

870
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,720
I'm saving it up for Wukong 2.

871
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,020
What if the...

872
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,980
What if the items, like, pass over to Wukong 2?

873
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,800
Guys, Wukong harder.

874
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,780
You guys don't know that?

875
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,880
It could, like...

876
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,140
It could, like, transfer over.

877
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,280
What if I need it?

878
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,400
Uh...

879
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,440
Wait, I can challenge him?

880
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:56,540
Okay.

881
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:56,880
Can I challenge him again?

882
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,920
Do I get more stuff if I challenge him again?

883
00:44:59,080 --> 00:44:59,380
Chat?

884
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,730
Or is it just a one-time thing?

885
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,710
No?

886
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,570
Why the fuck would I want to fight you?

887
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,010
Okay, let's see.

888
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,490
Yes.

889
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,230
Not now.

890
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:14,750
Okay.

891
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:15,230
I'm not...

892
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:15,470
No.

893
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:16,870
I didn't...

894
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,650
Acted like a monkey.

895
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:19,790
Millionaire!

896
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,030
Kaz!

897
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,790
Thank you!

898
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:22,810
Super chat!

899
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,350
Thank you!

900
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,170
Thank you!

901
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,910
No, you don't understand!

902
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,110
No!

903
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:27,950
No!

904
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,910
I gotta make sure I'm okay in second life!

905
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,050
Oh, no.

906
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:33,830
Did I fuck it up?

907
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:34,470
Oh, no.

908
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,590
Oh, no.

909
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,190
Okay, whoops.

910
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:40,910
Alright.

911
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,750
Sorry.

912
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:43,390
I just...

913
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,170
I like to run.

914
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:44,730
I...

915
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,710
Where am I going?

916
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,710
I'll never know where am I going!

917
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,530
Wait, wait, wait.

918
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:53,850
Okay.

919
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,170
We can leave now.

920
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:57,530
Alright.

921
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:57,950
We are...

922
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:58,170
Should we...

923
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:58,930
We should be at...

924
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,250
Oh my god.

925
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,030
I'm like...

926
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,070
I'm so like...

927
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,370
I don't know where we've been.

928
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:05,990
We're leaving...

929
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,530
Oh, there we go!

930
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:06,950
We were here.

931
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,690
He just loves to run, chat.

932
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,770
He just loves to run.

933
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,450
I think like everybody like finished this game and I'm still like on chapter four.

934
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:20,590
Am I chapter four?

935
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:21,110
Yeah.

936
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,250
There's still two more chapters.

937
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,610
Yeah.

938
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:23,850
Two...

939
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,870
I'm gonna try and finish...

940
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,110
The reason why I streamed this early today is I'm gonna try and finish another chapter.

941
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:28,170
Okay.

942
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:28,470
I'm gonna try and finish another chapter today.

943
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,510
Like I'm at part seven.

944
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:36,990
We're still...

945
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:37,810
We're still here.

946
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,170
Is there anything I'm missing here though?

947
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:41,530
Alright.

948
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,170
How do I fight?

949
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,330
Okay.

950
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,130
That's how I fight.

951
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,030
And then...

952
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:46,970
Okay.

953
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:47,370
There's that.

954
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,590
And there's my different stances.

955
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,010
Okay.

956
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:51,970
Wait.

957
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,610
How do I...

958
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,170
Okay.

959
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:53,550
There you go.

960
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:54,370
My talisman.

961
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:57,350
Alright.

962
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:57,990
Let's go.

963
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:58,150
Okay.

964
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:58,790
Off we go.

965
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,010
Things can't be that bad now.

966
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:02,290
Right?

967
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:04,650
Okay.

968
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:05,390
Watch this.

969
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,890
I remember how to fight.

970
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:07,950
See?

971
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:08,750
God.

972
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:09,750
I'm so fucking weak.

973
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,210
I remember how fucking weak I am.

974
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:13,610
Okay.

975
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:14,310
Oh.

976
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,250
Why are these so tanky?

977
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:16,810
Oh.

978
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:17,130
See.

979
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:17,690
I told you.

980
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:17,950
I can...

981
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:18,490
I still remember.

982
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,690
I still remember how to play.

983
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,050
Oh my god.

984
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,250
Oh my god.

985
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,050
Street Fighter made my fucking reflexes even better.

986
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,870
Look at that.

987
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:27,710
Oh.

988
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,150
Oh.

989
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,230
Oh my god.

990
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:32,090
I'll say my reflexes are even better now.

991
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,470
I still got it.

992
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,890
I still got it, chat.

993
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,870
Oh shit.

994
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:39,270
Okay.

995
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,210
What's this move?

996
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,230
What is...

997
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,190
Oh.

998
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,170
Hello.

999
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,670
I didn't...

1000
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:54,450
I was...

1001
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,370
I didn't know.

1002
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:55,770
I...

1003
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:56,610
I...

1004
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:57,510
I was like...

1005
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:57,990
I died.

1006
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:58,150
I died.

1007
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,410
I had to figure out what that move was.

1008
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,950
Oh my god.

1009
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,110
Okay.

1010
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:02,850
Reload.

1011
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:05,390
Reload.

1012
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,050
Okay.

1013
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:06,810
Now I know.

1014
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,910
Now I know.

1015
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,350
He never saw it coming.

1016
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:11,230
Is that...

1017
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:11,670
That's a...

1018
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,810
That's a scorpion, guys.

1019
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,050
That's not a cockroach.

1020
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,350
That's a...

1021
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,230
Guys.

1022
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,030
He has a tail.

1023
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:18,930
He has a...

1024
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:20,610
Okay.

1025
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,050
Nice.

1026
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:22,350
Oh.

1027
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,970
I got leaves.

1028
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:23,710
Gold leaves.

1029
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:25,410
Okay.

1030
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,350
I mean.

1031
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,150
What's so funny?

1032
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:28,370
It's not so bad.

1033
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:30,970
Okay.

1034
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,190
Then grab.

1035
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:33,830
All right.

1036
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:34,950
Let's see...

1037
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:35,950
Where do I have to go?

1038
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:36,710
Oh my god.

1039
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:38,850
Does it...

1040
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,570
Do I get less loss...?

1041
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:40,990
Like...

1042
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,690
Will there be any point of time where I get less loss?

1043
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,290
Like, in this game?

1044
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:47,630
I'm poisoned.

1045
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:48,570
Don't worry.

1046
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:49,470
I can...

1047
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:49,850
All...

1048
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:50,850
Like...

1049
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:54,590
Like every time you get poisoned you'll eventually get un-poisoned.

1050
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:55,010
What?

1051
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,850
Who the fuck shot me?

1052
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,150
I was scared.

1053
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,830
I was checking sightseeing.

1054
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:01,650
Oh no.

1055
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,230
Oh no.

1056
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,050
Oh no, there's so many.

1057
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:09,810
Oh no.

1058
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,790
Where the fuck did you come from?

1059
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,870
Yes, higher.

1060
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,330
Oh no.

1061
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,090
Oh no.

1062
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:27,490
There's so many pathways.

1063
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,030
I forgot how...

1064
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:40,250
I forgot how...

1065
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:45,270
how many pathways there are in this world.

1066
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:50,310
Okay, I haven't got this yet.

1067
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,390
Alright.

1068
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,270
That's my secret.

1069
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,210
I'm always lost.

1070
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,310
That way.

1071
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:03,350
Okay.

1072
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:04,910
Do I go down?

1073
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:06,750
Can I go down?

1074
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,230
Oh, I can.

1075
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,290
What is it with...

1076
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:09,690
You know what?

1077
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:10,890
I see green thing here.

1078
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:12,530
I absorb.

1079
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,110
I feel like going down is like...

1080
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,430
It's like the last thing I should be doing though.

1081
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:21,670
Oh no.

1082
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,870
Okay, apparently I can't go back up.

1083
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:25,250
Okay.

1084
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,470
I guess we go down.

1085
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,630
I can't.

1086
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,030
Where am I?

1087
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,070
I don't...

1088
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,030
I can't believe how many bugs are in this chapter.

1089
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,150
Shaking my head.

1090
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:38,910
I was thinking it was a super chat.

1091
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,750
Where am I?

1092
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,830
Actually, where am I?

1093
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,830
Oh my god, I can't believe I didn't dodge that.

1094
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:47,950
I made it down from here.

1095
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,130
That's right, anti-air.

1096
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,250
Where is this place?

1097
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:54,690
Where?

1098
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,530
Where is this place?

1099
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,870
Okay, let's go.

1100
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,370
Here we go.

1101
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,430
Down we go.

1102
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,250
So we're trying to find our friend.

1103
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,190
Pigsy.

1104
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,990
Chupacay.

1105
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,870
We're trying to find him because like...

1106
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:13,750
I don't know.

1107
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:14,770
He fucked a spider.

1108
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,870
I feel like he always has like a spider like girlfriend.

1109
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,120
Oh, this is it.

1110
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,640
I somehow went the right way.

1111
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,460
I don't know how.

1112
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,260
No, Pigsy.

1113
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,740
I know she has many legs, but it's not worth it.

1114
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,140
Chupacay, it's not worth it.

1115
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,020
Those legs.

1116
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,660
Big day.

1117
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,880
Big day.

1118
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:55,680
Shut up.

1119
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,540
You know what they say about eight legs.

1120
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,100
Big day.

1121
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,660
There's a word for you.

1122
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,120
I'm the big day.

1123
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,420
I'm the biggest day.

1124
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:17,480
I'm the biggest day.

1125
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,600
Oh, that's cool.

1126
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,120
If I ever see you again...

1127
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,540
I'm going to get it.

1128
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,420
If I ever see you again, I'm going to get it.

1129
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,500
I understand why...

1130
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,060
It's because I have a big day.

1131
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,140
I wouldn't be in this situation.

1132
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,980
If I were you, I wouldn't be in this situation.

1133
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:31,720
Okay.

1134
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Make her happy.

1135
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:34,180
Make me happy.

1136
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,400
Make me happy.

1137
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:35,500
There are children!

1138
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,460
There are so many children!

1139
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,260
It's not all about looks, ladies.

1140
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,140
Oh my god, so conceited.

1141
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,700
No, we still don't have figure subtitles.

1142
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,460
They did nerf some characters though.

1143
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,300
Some bosses.

1144
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,480
After I killed them.

1145
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,680
So like, that's cool.

1146
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,560
They nerfed two bosses, which I beat before.

1147
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,460
So I beat the hard version of them.

1148
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,260
And then they nerfed them afterwards.

1149
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,760
So like, fuck me, I guess.

1150
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,760
Is this like the baby sister?

1151
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,780
Is that a baby sister she's holding on to?

1152
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,420
The translation is different from what they're saying.

1153
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,080
You know when they're like, wait!

1154
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,860
But then she actually was like, sister!

1155
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:05,460
You know when they're like, wait!

1156
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:05,460
But then she actually was like, sister!

1157
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,960
The subtitles are translating the English dialogue.

1158
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,800
It's just little things.

1159
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:31,820
It's cause she's getting old.

1160
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,960
Put her in a home, I guess.

1161
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,440
Look, she's getting old.

1162
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,340
She needs to settle.

1163
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,260
If it has to be a pig man, then welcome your new stepfather.

1164
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,000
Mother is usually good.

1165
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,140
Only when she's eating, she's the only one who thinks alone.

1166
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,640
Don't get her into trouble.

1167
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:05,460
Mother is usually good.

1168
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:05,460
Only when she's eating, she's the only one who thinks alone.

1169
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,980
Let her settle!

1170
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,760
She needs somebody to take care!

1171
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,000
She needs somebody to take care!

1172
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,770
And don't let her die alone!

1173
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,410
Like, I can't believe they're judging her pig.

1174
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:36,270
Like, I mean, he seems like a respectable pig.

1175
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,160
Oh, she's old old.

1176
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,430
Yeah, he's like one of the top pig bachelors.

1177
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,800
Yay!

1178
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,600
See?

1179
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,740
Even spider grannies can find love.

1180
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,180
Guys.

1181
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:23,820
See?

1182
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,520
No matter what, even the spider grannies can find love in the end.

1183
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,020
Where am I?

1184
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,520
Okay, so this way... Alright, so I'm gonna teleport back and go the other way.

1185
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,880
I'll go back for you later.

1186
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,040
I realize I can explore a different way.

1187
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,020
Even if her daughter... Don't worry, I just realized there's another way I should go then.

1188
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,440
Sorry.

1189
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,760
Sorry, Pigsy.

1190
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,760
Sorry, Chewbacca.

1191
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,500
I need a...

1192
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,640
I need... I need...

1193
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,780
I need to go the other way.

1194
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:01,060
I need to explore.

1195
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,040
Okay, so this way is to...

1196
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,920
This way will be to the spider lady.

1197
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,160
So I can go this way.

1198
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,180
That means I can go this way, guys.

1199
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,980
And that should give me another pathway.

1200
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,600
Because the other way is to the plot.

1201
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,260
And we don't need to go to do the plot yet.

1202
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:22,800
We can explore.

1203
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,080
Don't worry, I'll be back for you!

1204
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,620
Don't worry!

1205
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,360
Go have some granny action!

1206
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,960
You know, I'm giving them this... I'm giving him some time.

1207
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,080
I'm giving him like privacy, you know?

1208
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,580
I'm a good friend.

1209
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,780
I'm literally such a good friend.

1210
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,520
I'm letting him have a good time.

1211
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,580
Oh, I should... Maybe I'll just grab this.

1212
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:52,700
Go!

1213
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:52,780
Go!

1214
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,940
Oh, my monkeys!

1215
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,380
There's a spirit there.

1216
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,380
Go do your thing.

1217
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,660
What the fuck?

1218
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,840
Okay, I guess we all are gonna get trapped.

1219
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,400
Not like that, though.

1220
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,580
Not like that.

1221
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:07,920
All right.

1222
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:08,840
Oh, shit!

1223
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,020
Summons time.

1224
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,780
Okay, I never used the summons before.

1225
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,080
Okay, heavy attack.

1226
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,900
Okay, do I do damage?

1227
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,460
Like, oh my god, it's like...

1228
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:24,680
What!

1229
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,240
That's it!

1230
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,500
Wait, is that actually it?

1231
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,520
Oh, God, I'm him.

1232
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,500
There's no way!

1233
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,840
That's actually it!

1234
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,620
I mean, okay.

1235
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,180
I guess it's because he's like...

1236
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,840
Oh, but it's like a lot- Oh!

1237
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,200
wait, never mind, never mind!

1238
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,260
Okay, that's a lot of damage!

1239
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,720
Never mind, I didn't realize this fucking thing lasts forever.

1240
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,620
Actually, it is worth it.

1241
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,260
Holy shit this This thing lasts forever.

1242
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,700
Like, that fucking summon lasts so long.

1243
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,580
I need to build focus.

1244
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,600
Oh, his counter is very powerful.

1245
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,560
He stopped, he let himself go.

1246
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,260
He's let himself go afterwards.

1247
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,220
Okay, nice.

1248
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,560
Don't worry, Chewbacca, I'll come back for you, I swear to god.

1249
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,580
I'm sorry, like, all I'm saying is that, like, I don't know, like...

1250
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,880
Come on, you have a hot grand grand situation going on.

1251
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,720
And I'm just trying to make sure I'm... I can retire.

1252
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,880
Okay, let's see.

1253
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,000
Okay, we got a summon.

1254
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,160
I guess we can go downstairs.

1255
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,080
Hello.

1256
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,400
Alright.

1257
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,040
Is there anything here?

1258
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:56,980
What's over here?

1259
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:58,780
Ooh.

1260
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,120
What is over here?

1261
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:01,940
Where am I?

1262
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,900
Where the fuck am I?

1263
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,340
Where am I?

1264
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,320
I'm fucking...

1265
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,960
Where the fuck is this place?

1266
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,280
Okay,

1267
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,140
let's see.

1268
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,840
Yeah, I'm just being a good bro.

1269
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,200
I'm just being a good bro.

1270
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:19,880
I'm just being a good bro, guys.

1271
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:20,820
Wait, is this the...

1272
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,760
God damn it, did I go in a circle?

1273
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,600
I went in a circle.

1274
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,040
Wait, that's what that was?

1275
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,960
Oh, I'm in the... I went in a circle.

1276
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,420
This is where the bridge was.

1277
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:34,680
Right?

1278
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:35,560
Yeah.

1279
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,200
God fucking...

1280
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:37,440
Okay.

1281
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,000
Instant transmission.

1282
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,220
It's the sax.

1283
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,260
Yeah, nope, she's not working.

1284
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:44,600
Kyle!

1285
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,160
You gotta expand your horizons, Kyle!

1286
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,680
You know what they say about eight legs, Kyle!

1287
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,400
Thank you for the super chat, Kyle.

1288
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,560
Thank you, thank you.

1289
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,720
And, like, she has experience!

1290
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:06,460
She must be, like, 500 years worth of experience, Kyle!

1291
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,080
What do they say?

1292
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,140
I'm so confused.

1293
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,140
Look up...

1294
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:19,040
The Little Mermaid Eight Legs.

1295
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,220
I think that's right.

1296
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,520
Then you'll know.

1297
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,280
Sorry, what?

1298
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,280
The Little Mermaid Eight Legs!

1299
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,900
It's a classic!

1300
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:37,320
It's a...

1301
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,580
You guys have never seen it?

1302
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:39,780
Okay, we're pausing.

1303
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,060
You guys have never seen that video?

1304
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,400
Okay.

1305
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:45,820
The little...

1306
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:46,280
There's a...

1307
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,120
It's a whole lot of...

1308
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,240
It's not just eight legs, but, like, there's a lot more.

1309
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,220
It came...

1310
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:54,980
It's this one.

1311
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,060
Ariel needs legs.

1312
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:58,940
Here.

1313
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,260
This is where it comes from.

1314
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,440
It's a classic!

1315
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:07,900
It's...

1316
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,580
Oh, shit, sorry.

1317
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,420
I had to put on my glasses because I had to...

1318
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,280
put on my reading glasses there.

1319
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,280
Wait, where did...

1320
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,480
Where did that come from?

1321
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,800
Oh, I came in this way.

1322
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,060
Okay.

1323
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,900
Then I could go up then.

1324
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,560
Don't release that cursed knowledge.

1325
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:36,120
If I had to grow up with that, then you do too.

1326
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,900
All these lines make a circle.

1327
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,240
Michael, thank you for the super chat.

1328
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:44,680
Thank you.

1329
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,260
Thank you.

1330
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,260
Oh, shit.

1331
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,140
Okay, nice.

1332
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:54,880
I still killed him.

1333
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:55,840
I still killed him.

1334
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,980
You can't escape from me.

1335
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,320
Oh, shit.

1336
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,220
You too.

1337
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:01,900
I got lost.

1338
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:02,880
I lost access.

1339
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,680
Headed east instead of west.

1340
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,600
Send help.

1341
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,220
Kyle, thank you for the super chat.

1342
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:07,620
Thank you.

1343
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,020
Thank you.

1344
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:08,860
Another Kyle?

1345
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,420
Oh, my God.

1346
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,860
There's Kyle A and Kyle C.

1347
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,220
I love Kyle.

1348
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,580
I'm going to learn things today.

1349
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,020
Okay, here we go.

1350
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,800
Now we can open this chest.

1351
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,260
I couldn't watch it.

1352
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,640
It hurts my soul.

1353
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,000
All right.

1354
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:30,700
Open.

1355
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:35,170
Nice.

1356
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,950
The long aura amplification.

1357
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:38,570
Nice.

1358
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:40,170
More stuff I won't use.

1359
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,230
I like that.

1360
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:43,610
I like hoarding.

1361
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:49,230
I don't hoard cash, I just hoard... I just hoard video game items.

1362
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:52,350
Oh, I was here.

1363
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,510
I came from here.

1364
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,370
So... I was here.

1365
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,730
Does that mean... Oh no!

1366
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:00,150
Okay.

1367
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:00,850
Alright, now!

1368
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,050
Don't worry, I'm gonna help now.

1369
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,530
I'm pretty sure you're done with the granny, right?

1370
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,130
Now I can like show up, right?

1371
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,830
I should be able to show up now.

1372
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,850
He has to be done with the grand-grand.

1373
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:15,850
Let's see.

1374
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:17,310
This way.

1375
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,850
Oh, I didn't see this pathway before.

1376
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:20,930
What is this?

1377
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:22,710
What is this?

1378
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,310
Wait, this is new.

1379
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,970
Sorry, I'm gonna be going this way instead.

1380
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,370
This is new, right?

1381
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:35,010
Is this new?

1382
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,230
This has to be new, right?

1383
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,110
I don't remember... Oh my god, no it's not.

1384
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,650
No, it's not new.

1385
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:49,390
God fucking... God damn it.

1386
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:52,210
I'm going in a circle again.

1387
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:55,130
I'm going in the goddamn circle.

1388
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:56,510
Alright.

1389
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,930
And then...

1390
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,430
We're...

1391
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,430
How did I get from here to a circle?

1392
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:06,770
Oh, he is not getting saved.

1393
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:07,710
I don't know where...

1394
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:13,370
Guys, I don't know where he...

1395
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,130
I don't know how I got there.

1396
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:16,710
Oh, he's so fucked.

1397
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:20,690
How did I get there?

1398
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,250
Oh my god.

1399
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:27,310
I think he's just gonna have to live with her.

1400
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,710
Monkey's lost.

1401
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,750
Monkey is very lost right now.

1402
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:36,950
Okay, so like...

1403
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:38,170
This...

1404
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:40,810
This...

1405
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:41,570
Wait, what?

1406
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:43,570
No, it's here.

1407
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:43,950
It's here.

1408
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:44,290
I remember.

1409
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:44,970
I killed this guy.

1410
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:46,110
I remember now.

1411
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,350
I killed him.

1412
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,750
Okay, and then...

1413
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,630
Where am I?

1414
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,150
Okay, and then we...

1415
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:03,490
We go down here.

1416
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:03,750
Yes!

1417
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:04,910
Okay, I remember now.

1418
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:05,610
This is familiar.

1419
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:06,050
Okay.

1420
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:07,830
And this is where I saw the whole cutscene.

1421
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:08,190
Yeah.

1422
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,190
Alright, nice.

1423
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:09,450
Alright.

1424
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:10,010
Don't worry.

1425
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:11,630
Now I figured it out.

1426
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:15,610
El Mexican.

1427
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:16,910
Thank you for the super chat.

1428
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:17,310
Thank you.

1429
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:17,790
Thank you.

1430
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:18,610
See, I told you.

1431
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:19,610
I'm a good homie.

1432
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:21,670
Never leave a homie behind.

1433
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:25,990
Alright.

1434
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:28,770
Know when to give the homie the...

1435
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:29,610
You know how like...

1436
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,330
You're at a bad date or whatever.

1437
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:32,950
And then like...

1438
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,350
And then you're like...

1439
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:35,890
Oh shit.

1440
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:36,470
Like...

1441
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:37,810
I need out right now.

1442
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:40,490
And then your homie gives you an emergency call.

1443
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,990
And pretends to be like...

1444
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:43,850
Oh my god!

1445
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,850
Emergency!

1446
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,790
You need to go to the hospital.

1447
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:48,310
To get you out of...

1448
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:49,510
The bad situation.

1449
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:50,610
I'm him.

1450
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:51,930
I'm that guy.

1451
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,510
I'm here to give you the fake phone call.

1452
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:55,410
For you to leave.

1453
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:56,990
Don't worry.

1454
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,390
Don't worry, Chupacay.

1455
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,870
Have that phone ready.

1456
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:01,370
We'll give you the call.

1457
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:02,470
Hahaha!

1458
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:03,590
Hahaha!

1459
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,230
Don't worry!

1460
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:07,970
I'm gonna...

1461
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:08,730
Thanks, bro.

1462
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:09,430
Hahaha!

1463
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:16,890
xDKBrosCode66 I actually own the...

1464
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:19,150
Barney Simpson bro code book.

1465
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:19,890
Like...

1466
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:21,030
I actually...

1467
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:25,210
I have a physical hard copy of that.

1468
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:26,190
Like...

1469
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,470
So I know the bro code, guys.

1470
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:29,710
Don't worry.

1471
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:30,830
I'm a true bro.

1472
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:32,350
I have the...

1473
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:34,830
Physical hard copy edition.

1474
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,730
Of the bro code.

1475
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:37,190
Hahaha!

1476
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,390
So I'll be there.

1477
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,650
I'll be there for you.

1478
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:41,210
Hahaha!

1479
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:44,870
I'll be that bro.

1480
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,150
That's true, bro.

1481
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:51,450
Appreciate the bro mission.

1482
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:52,090
Hahaha!

1483
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:53,330
Holy shit!

1484
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:54,490
Hey.

1485
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,890
Why are they so fly?

1486
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:57,610
Why do they...

1487
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:58,590
Why are they fly like that?

1488
01:07:58,670 --> 01:07:59,430
What the f...

1489
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,070
Is this an a...

1490
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,430
Am I not supposed to be down here?

1491
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,690
This seems scary.

1492
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:03,830
Like...

1493
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:04,450
Hahaha!

1494
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:04,810
Hahaha!

1495
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,650
Bro, I will read for my bro.

1496
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,230
I'll learn how to read for my bro.

1497
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:10,450
Hahaha!

1498
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:12,390
Thanks, bro.

1499
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:13,370
Hahaha!

1500
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,510
The best romances are bromance.

1501
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,310
That's all I'm saying.

1502
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:18,410
Hahaha!

1503
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:20,930
Hahaha!

1504
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:21,090
Hahaha!

1505
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,890
A bro will always be there for you.

1506
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:25,510
Whoa, bro.

1507
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:26,170
True.

1508
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:28,510
He's so real.

1509
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,190
Hahaha!

1510
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:30,290
Hahaha!

1511
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:31,310
Hahaha!

1512
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:31,530
Hahaha!

1513
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:34,250
Why is there so many of you?

1514
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,510
You're not spiders.

1515
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:37,370
I cannot aim.

1516
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:38,310
Oh, my God.

1517
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:39,030
Bro, please.

1518
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:39,830
Please.

1519
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,090
Please!

1520
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:43,950
Oh, my God.

1521
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:45,850
You guys are so fucking annoying.

1522
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:47,150
Holy shit.

1523
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:50,630
I will use my magic to get out of the way.

1524
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:52,430
Okay.

1525
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:53,590
Nice.

1526
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,890
These guys are actually...

1527
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:57,370
Oh, and then there's big worm!

1528
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,510
Oh, shit!

1529
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,530
There's way too many...

1530
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:02,950
There's way too many things on my screen right now.

1531
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:04,150
I cannot deal with this.

1532
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,370
There's way too many things on my screen.

1533
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:07,290
There's...

1534
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:08,790
There's way...

1535
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,090
I will poke you.

1536
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:12,250
Okay.

1537
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:12,650
Nice.

1538
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:14,450
All right.

1539
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:14,690
Nice.

1540
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:14,890
Okay.

1541
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:15,290
We're okay.

1542
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:16,410
We're...

1543
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:16,970
We are...

1544
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:17,510
Okay.

1545
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:19,450
What the fuck is this baby doing here?

1546
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,310
This is not your battle!

1547
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:21,690
Girl!

1548
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:22,010
Girl!

1549
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:22,570
Girl!

1550
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:23,690
Go through puberty first!

1551
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,730
This is literally not your fight!

1552
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:31,010
Oh, please don't tell me they respawn.

1553
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:31,550
Like...

1554
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,090
Like, why is there another one?

1555
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:39,110
Okay.

1556
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:39,450
Nice.

1557
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:42,830
All right.

1558
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,330
I won't fucking use my magic.

1559
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:44,850
I can't.

1560
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:46,750
I cannot deal with these guys!

1561
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:49,010
Okay.

1562
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:49,470
Nice.

1563
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,450
Get them out of here.

1564
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:53,750
Goodbye!

1565
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:57,010
All right.

1566
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:57,290
Nice.

1567
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:57,750
All right.

1568
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:00,110
I assume these are all worms, right?

1569
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,530
If not, I'm just gonna...

1570
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,970
That has to be a worm.

1571
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:03,990
That looks like a...

1572
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,070
Oh!

1573
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:05,130
Oh, shit!

1574
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:06,410
What the fuck?

1575
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,130
What a bait!

1576
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:09,470
I got baited so hard there.

1577
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:12,510
Wait, there's more of the other ones?

1578
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:15,430
Okay.

1579
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,610
This is not good.

1580
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:17,870
This is it.

1581
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:18,690
Fuck this.

1582
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:20,650
I'm gonna send in reinforcements.

1583
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:21,590
Go.

1584
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:22,310
Do your thing.

1585
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:23,790
I don't wanna fight anymore.

1586
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,310
I'm gonna...

1587
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:27,550
What's it called when you, like...

1588
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,430
Do they respawn?

1589
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:30,890
Do these guys respawn?

1590
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,610
It's like, why is there another one?

1591
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:34,070
I don't know.

1592
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,250
You know, like, when you...

1593
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:42,910
When you get work and then you give it to somebody else to do for a cheaper price?

1594
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:46,290
I'm doing that right now with my little monkeys.

1595
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:47,330
I...

1596
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:50,590
No, no, no.

1597
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:51,730
Outsourcing.

1598
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:52,650
Yeah, I'm outsourcing.

1599
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:58,410
I'm outsourcing my duties right now to the other monkeys.

1600
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:03,490
I mean, you just rip a few of your hairs and then you get cheap labor right there.

1601
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:05,770
Oh.

1602
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,670
Better be like...

1603
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:09,650
Can I rob this man's grave?

1604
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:11,690
Okay.

1605
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:12,610
Just gotta make sure.

1606
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,770
Yes, I can.

1607
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,310
Thank god.

1608
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:15,910
Okay.

1609
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:18,010
Wait.

1610
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:19,310
There's somebody above me?

1611
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:19,930
Where?

1612
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:22,270
Oh, there.

1613
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:23,290
What the fuck?

1614
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:24,630
Oh, free labor.

1615
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:25,290
Oh my god.

1616
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:26,470
That's better than cheap labor.

1617
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:29,050
Alright.

1618
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:30,750
Robbing this children's grave.

1619
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:31,930
Okay.

1620
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:32,410
Okay.

1621
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:33,470
Okay.

1622
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:33,930
Nice.

1623
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:34,890
They're dead already.

1624
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:36,210
They don't need the gold anymore.

1625
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:40,970
Even though, like, technically in, like, um, in, like, Chinese...

1626
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:41,710
Uh...

1627
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,510
What?

1628
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:43,210
How are you invisible?

1629
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,470
In...

1630
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:47,990
In...

1631
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:54,070
Even though, technically, in China, when you, when you bury something in the grave, it's supposed to...

1632
01:11:54,070 --> 01:12:00,630
Or, like, burn stuff and put in the grave or whatever, um, it technically goes with them to heaven.

1633
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:03,070
So, like, now they don't have the item anymore.

1634
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:03,810
So...

1635
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:07,870
It can't be that important, you know?

1636
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:09,030
It can't be that...

1637
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:11,430
I used to do that when I used to live in Asia.

1638
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:12,670
Um...

1639
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:13,570
Because it's, like, a...

1640
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:22,510
I don't remember what it's called, but it's, like, a special day where a bunch of family would go to visit the graves and then go and burn, like, those, like, paper...

1641
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:24,730
Um...

1642
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:25,010
Um...

1643
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:28,490
Burn, like, specific paper that's shaped, like, different types of stuff.

1644
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:29,450
Um...

1645
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,070
And to, like, give these items to the...

1646
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:32,970
Um...

1647
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:33,050
Um...

1648
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:34,510
To the dead.

1649
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:36,810
It's not just paper money.

1650
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:39,170
It's, like, they're, like, shaped, like...

1651
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:42,470
They're, like, shaped, like, uh, certain items and stuff.

1652
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:45,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that festival.

1653
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:46,670
Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:48,490
Yeah.

1655
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:52,150
And, like, there's, like, a special, uh...

1656
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:54,590
There's, like, a special area.

1657
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,750
Because, like, the higher...

1658
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:58,670
There's, like, some grave sites where...

1659
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:04,750
You know how, like, in Western culture, um, grave sites are, like, usually just, like, plotted land in the...

1660
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:05,170
In...

1661
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:05,850
In the middle?

1662
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:07,350
Like, it's just, like, flat?

1663
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:08,350
Uh...

1664
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,430
Or, like, those, like...

1665
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:11,370
Like, cemetery...

1666
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:13,010
Castle thingies?

1667
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:13,910
I don't know what they're called.

1668
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:14,550
Like...

1669
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,490
Yeah, it's, like, a...

1670
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:19,370
A bank transfer to your ancestor.

1671
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:20,730
Yeah, so...

1672
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,250
So, but in, um...

1673
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:29,370
In Chinese culture, the higher your grave is to the sky, um, the closer they are to heaven.

1674
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:30,730
So, like...

1675
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:31,210
To...

1676
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:32,130
So, like...

1677
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:33,750
To be higher.

1678
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:35,490
Instead of, like...

1679
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:36,370
Like...

1680
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,350
We don't do it flat.

1681
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:37,950
We make...

1682
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:43,350
We make it so that if you get the higher, uh, plotted land, then you're closer to heaven.

1683
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,890
So, it, like, considered, like, you're, like...

1684
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:48,130
It's, like, higher status and stuff like that.

1685
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,050
Which is really interesting.

1686
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:50,310
Um...

1687
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:51,230
And I would go, like...

1688
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:51,610
I remember...

1689
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:52,170
Oh, my God.

1690
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:53,410
Then you can buy, like...

1691
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:58,970
I remember because, like, when the iPhone came out, they released those, like, paper iPhones.

1692
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:00,890
So, I remember, like, going there.

1693
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:02,150
And then...

1694
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,710
And then, uh...

1695
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:05,650
Uh...

1696
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:06,330
And then...

1697
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:07,270
My mom...

1698
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:10,470
I think, like, my parents were, like, it's time to give grandma an iPhone.

1699
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:14,950
And then we would burn these, like, iPhones and, like, clothes and, like...

1700
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,090
And stuff.

1701
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:17,170
It's so fun.

1702
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:20,070
It's so cute and funny at the same time.

1703
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:23,190
I think it's just a nice thought, you know?

1704
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:28,570
Like, your ancestors get to have, like, iPhones and stuff, too, up there by burning a paper iPhone.

1705
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:33,610
Yeah, it's so cute.

1706
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:34,170
I love it.

1707
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:34,530
That was cute.

1708
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:39,010
And, like, it's, like...

1709
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:41,370
You can burn, like, bags and, like...

1710
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:42,030
There's, like...

1711
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:42,570
And it's so...

1712
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:45,530
It's so cute, too, because there's, like, designer paper...

1713
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:50,750
Like, there's, like, things where you can, like, burn, like, things that look like designer bags or clothes.

1714
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:51,570
And you, like...

1715
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,850
Let's give grandma good clothes, you know?

1716
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:58,650
What's grandma gonna do with an iPhone?

1717
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:03,150
I mean, she can go play games on the iPhone and go through...

1718
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,390
Go do the internet stuff.

1719
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:05,170
Yeah.

1720
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:05,710
Yeah.

1721
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:12,110
And then you burn money, so it's, like, you give, like, a bank transfer to your ancestors, too.

1722
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:15,510
But, like, the default is, like, paper money.

1723
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:17,610
Like, not actual money, but it's, like...

1724
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:19,150
Like, God money.

1725
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:20,570
Like...

1726
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:22,090
Like, heaven money.

1727
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:27,690
She can be a gamer in heaven.

1728
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:31,570
Oh, shit.

1729
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:34,410
I always thought...

1730
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:35,710
I thought that was, like, really interesting.

1731
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:36,870
Oh, no.

1732
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:37,250
I'm stuck.

1733
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,930
Oh, no.

1734
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:38,210
I'm stuck.

1735
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:38,490
Please.

1736
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,170
The heavenly cash.

1737
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:41,530
Yeah.

1738
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:42,870
Heavenly cash.

1739
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:45,770
Oh, God.

1740
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:46,290
Damn it.

1741
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:47,270
I just...

1742
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:48,190
I need...

1743
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:49,110
One at a time, guys.

1744
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:49,910
One at a time.

1745
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:55,310
I haven't done...

1746
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:56,690
I haven't, uh...

1747
01:15:57,690 --> 01:15:58,130
Uh...

1748
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:02,630
Visited the graves in a while, though, since I haven't been in Asia in a long time.

1749
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:04,970
Because of COVID.

1750
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:06,470
So, like...

1751
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:07,830
Because, like, when everything...

1752
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:08,790
I used to visit...

1753
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:09,050
Uh...

1754
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:10,150
Visit Asia...

1755
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:11,650
Um...

1756
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:12,770
Once a year.

1757
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,330
Or, like, every other year.

1758
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:18,990
But ever since, like, COVID happened, like, I haven't traveled a lot.

1759
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:20,590
I haven't gone...

1760
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:21,730
I haven't been able to travel.

1761
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,770
So, it'd be nice.

1762
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:26,290
I really wanna go back eventually when things cool down.

1763
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:27,530
I am gonna die.

1764
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,890
Where the fuck is, like...

1765
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:30,930
Oh, I'm poisoned.

1766
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,930
Guys, I'm gonna die from poison.

1767
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,950
I'm actually gonna die from poison.

1768
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:35,890
Where is the shrine?

1769
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:37,130
Oh my god!

1770
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:37,950
It's right in front of me!

1771
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,010
Oh, damn!

1772
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:40,110
Okay.

1773
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:44,390
I died, like, right in front of the shrine.

1774
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:46,770
Uh, it would be so sad.

1775
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:47,670
I...

1776
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,110
I would be...

1777
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:53,930
I would be so sad if I actually died in front of it.

1778
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,530
Holy shit!

1779
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:56,870
That was close.

1780
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:57,770
That was...

1781
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:59,430
That was so close.

1782
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:01,190
Oh, my god.

1783
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:01,670
Yes.

1784
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:04,610
I'm gonna do the spellbinding.

1785
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:04,950
I think I'm gonna die.

1786
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:06,250
I think, like, spellbinding helps a lot.

1787
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:06,790
I'm gonna...

1788
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,970
Redo my spells.

1789
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,010
Okay.

1790
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:11,230
Um...

1791
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,910
Spellbinder.

1792
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:13,730
Okay.

1793
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:16,210
I think the spellbinder is pretty cool.

1794
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,590
Last minute situation.

1795
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:20,950
I was like, where is it?

1796
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:23,730
Thank god.

1797
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:24,170
Okay.

1798
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:25,670
Thank god I got it in time.

1799
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:26,930
Thank god.

1800
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:30,510
Can I obtain materials from...

1801
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:31,590
Dude, I don't really need materials.

1802
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:32,970
Okay.

1803
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:34,930
Spellbinder.

1804
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:35,950
Is this?

1805
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,410
No, that's pluck.

1806
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,510
Fuck is my spellbinder?

1807
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:43,810
Alright.

1808
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:46,910
Give me my spellbinder.

1809
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,170
I don't need immobilize anymore.

1810
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:50,990
Uh...

1811
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,530
How do I get rid of you?

1812
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:54,150
I forgot.

1813
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:55,870
Uh...

1814
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:56,450
I need a...

1815
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:56,750
Oh, wait.

1816
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:57,870
I think it's, like, on the shrine.

1817
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:02,480
Uh...

1818
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,240
It's a reignite.

1819
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:08,480
Okay.

1820
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,000
There you go.

1821
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:10,600
Yeah.

1822
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:11,940
I'd love to, like, uh...

1823
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,000
Go back whenever...

1824
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,280
I haven't been able to go back after COVID was over.

1825
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:17,400
Well, not over, but, like, you know...

1826
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:17,620
Ha!

1827
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,620
Manageable now.

1828
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,200
Like, I think that's a more appropriate word because we all know it's not over.

1829
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:25,560
Like...

1830
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:27,560
Um...

1831
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:28,640
Okay.

1832
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:29,540
Um...

1833
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,560
Oh, I guess I have to do all of it.

1834
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:32,800
Uh...

1835
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,880
I've just been so busy.

1836
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,260
I've been so busy.

1837
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,220
I haven't even had a chance to go back.

1838
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:37,680
Okay.

1839
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,470
Let's see.

1840
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:42,130
Oh, yeah.

1841
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:43,510
Now I have to redo this, too.

1842
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:47,570
Uh...

1843
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:50,830
Increases the damage of the next attack after dodge.

1844
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:52,730
Slight increases attack.

1845
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:55,810
Increases invincibility when seeing through.

1846
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:57,850
Increases frost damage.

1847
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:00,970
Increases attack.

1848
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:01,550
Okay.

1849
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,070
Nice.

1850
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,130
Alright.

1851
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:07,310
I wanted to use spellbinder because, like, I like to unga bunga more.

1852
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:08,870
Um...

1853
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,290
But I want to, like, to go back.

1854
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:11,110
Um...

1855
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:14,790
When, like, things calm down in my life and I...

1856
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:18,530
Like, I have my life under control.

1857
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:23,030
No reason why I haven't, like, traveled or really...

1858
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:24,490
I've only traveled for business.

1859
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:27,410
I haven't traveled for leisure in a long time.

1860
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:32,970
So, like, I'm hoping I can travel again soon.

1861
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:34,810
Because I want to go back to Asia.

1862
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,070
Um...

1863
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:37,950
And just, like, you know...

1864
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,030
Just for pleasure.

1865
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:44,840
Oh!

1866
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:45,540
Goodbye, spiders!

1867
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,060
Wrong way!

1868
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:54,900
But there's this guy in front of me!

1869
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,940
How is there another way?

1870
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,640
But he's guarding the door!

1871
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:12,120
How can it be a wrong way?

1872
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,620
When he's literally trying to guard the door!

1873
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:15,800
All right.

1874
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,500
That's looking right.

1875
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,020
I'm strong now.

1876
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:18,840
That's...

1877
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,220
Oh, shit.

1878
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:19,880
Okay.

1879
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,600
Like, I am strong, though.

1880
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,100
But, like, give me a sec, bro.

1881
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,920
Give me a sec.

1882
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:27,140
Okay.

1883
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:27,500
Nice.

1884
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:27,860
All right.

1885
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,280
I'm still strong, though.

1886
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:29,960
It's just, you know...

1887
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,520
It's just unfortunate that you got that hit in.

1888
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:33,780
There's a back door?

1889
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,180
Okay.

1890
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,220
Now you're fucking with me.

1891
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:35,780
There's no one.

1892
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,100
There's no way.

1893
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,100
He's literally guarding the door.

1894
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,400
All right.

1895
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,440
Off we go.

1896
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:56,170
All right.

1897
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:56,550
Ooh.

1898
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:57,870
Hey.

1899
01:20:58,690 --> 01:20:59,670
Is he a pig?

1900
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:00,750
Oh, no.

1901
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:01,330
He's a bug.

1902
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:01,810
Okay.

1903
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,270
You're...

1904
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:03,130
Okay.

1905
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:03,750
He's still alive.

1906
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:04,230
Okay.

1907
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:04,890
I wasn't too late.

1908
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:06,730
Oh, it's him again!

1909
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:09,670
Oh, shit!

1910
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:10,690
It's the light guy!

1911
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,890
His only job is to provide light!

1912
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:18,940
Wait.

1913
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,340
How am I already in another shrine?

1914
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:25,160
What?

1915
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:25,860
Wait.

1916
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,020
Maybe I did go the wrong way.

1917
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,480
Why is there another shrine so fast?

1918
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,300
Why is there another shrine?

1919
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:32,620
Why did I already get to another shrine?

1920
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,940
Is there actually another way?

1921
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,280
I don't know.

1922
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:41,960
He was right!

1923
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,200
No!

1924
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:43,620
No!

1925
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:44,040
No!

1926
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:44,900
No!

1927
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:46,600
No!

1928
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,400
No!

1929
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:49,980
He was right!

1930
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,660
And we made fun of him!

1931
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:56,800
I got...

1932
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,340
We made fun of him for being right.

1933
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,180
Wait.

1934
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,120
But which way is it?

1935
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,800
I don't even remember.

1936
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,280
Okay.

1937
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,620
This is where I came from.

1938
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,480
So, apparently, there's a crack somewhere.

1939
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:10,800
I have to...

1940
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,720
Go.

1941
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,340
Dragoons never lie.

1942
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:15,960
Wait.

1943
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,240
Then...

1944
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,040
Where would it...

1945
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,940
Is it here?

1946
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:18,380
Is it here?

1947
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:23,600
Where would the fucking crack be?

1948
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:27,440
Vindication.

1949
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,920
He was right!

1950
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:30,660
Oh.

1951
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:31,920
Go back.

1952
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:32,320
Okay.

1953
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:34,680
Oh.

1954
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,060
Is it here?

1955
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,320
Can I...

1956
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,000
No.

1957
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,260
No.

1958
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,400
This is just a wall.

1959
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,180
Before the shrine?

1960
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,180
Oh.

1961
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,580
Before the shrine.

1962
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,940
It should be like...

1963
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,220
Somewhere here?

1964
01:22:59,100 --> 01:22:59,660
No.

1965
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:00,960
Not here.

1966
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,180
So, it should be...

1967
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:02,880
Ow.

1968
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,160
Bro.

1969
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:05,440
Stop.

1970
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:06,220
Bro.

1971
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:06,580
Stop.

1972
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,520
Stop.

1973
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,720
Not cool, bro.

1974
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,460
Oh.

1975
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:10,980
This one.

1976
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:12,140
Oh.

1977
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:12,680
There it is.

1978
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:14,100
Oh my god.

1979
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,180
It's such a tiny crack!

1980
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:20,570
Alright.

1981
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:21,330
Okay.

1982
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:22,030
Okay.

1983
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:22,110
Okay.

1984
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:23,910
Nice.

1985
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,140
Up we go.

1986
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,380
Up we go.

1987
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:32,540
Oh!

1988
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,280
It's just...

1989
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,300
There's no boss here.

1990
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,200
It's just to meditate.

1991
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,800
What do you mean?

1992
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,700
Do you think...

1993
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:50,920
Do you think my bro is done with Granny Spotter?

1994
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,880
Or do you think he needs more time?

1995
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:55,440
I don't know when to call the phone yet.

1996
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,140
He never specify when I should call.

1997
01:23:59,060 --> 01:23:59,940
He's dead.

1998
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:00,980
He's dead.

1999
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:01,140
He's dead.

2000
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:08,680
You said I should call, but I don't know when I should do it.

2001
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:09,420
Like, bro.

2002
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:09,780
I don't...

2003
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,160
I don't know.

2004
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:18,160
Should I bring water?

2005
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:18,880
Like...

2006
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,100
Okay.

2007
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,680
Let's see.

2008
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:26,820
We go...

2009
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:27,280
Oh.

2010
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:27,640
There's another.

2011
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:27,920
Oh.

2012
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,260
There is!

2013
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:30,040
Which way?

2014
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:30,280
Okay.

2015
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:30,920
I came from this way.

2016
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,380
So, this is where the boss should be.

2017
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:33,740
Okay.

2018
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,720
This meditation is wild!

2019
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:41,860
Alright, let's get him out of the way.

2020
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:42,620
Don't fall.

2021
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,260
I swear.

2022
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:43,700
Okay.

2023
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:44,180
Thank God.

2024
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,920
I didn't wanna fall.

2025
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:46,800
I was worried there.

2026
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:48,320
Oh, hey.

2027
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,020
There's another thingy.

2028
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,640
Bro didn't give me the code word.

2029
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,080
Not the safe word, bro.

2030
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,180
Because like, bro...

2031
01:24:59,060 --> 01:24:59,740
You're making it weird, bro.

2032
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,060
You're making it weird, bro.

2033
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:03,740
Bro...

2034
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,620
Like, don't call it a safe word, bro.

2035
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,560
That's fucking weird.

2036
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,060
Oh, there it is.

2037
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,120
It's another frog!

2038
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:13,380
No!

2039
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,900
They're gonna... I'm gonna get judged again!

2040
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:18,980
No!

2041
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:19,960
Not the frog!

2042
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,960
I'm gonna get critiques on my boss plays because of a fucking frog!

2043
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,140
Not again!

2044
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,020
No!

2045
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,040
Not the frog again!

2046
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,380
No!

2047
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:41,480
They're gonna fucking... They're gonna brain fade me again!

2048
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,940
You know the script!

2049
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:47,020
No!

2050
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,360
Oh god.

2051
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,040
No.

2052
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,700
I'm gonna get that message again, guys.

2053
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:56,600
I'm gonna...

2054
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:57,940
One

2055
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:04,010
guy is gonna be back in the comments!

2056
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:08,150
I lose for the views.

2057
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:11,290
Here comes the frog.

2058
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:13,410
No!

2059
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:20,290
I don't even remember... Okay, this is the way.

2060
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:23,290
The frog strikes again.

2061
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:26,550
God fucking dammit.

2062
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:28,210
She followed the script.

2063
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:32,330
Why is it always the frogs?

2064
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:36,610
Here comes the content farm!

2065
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,630
Guys, I only lost because I'm just farming content, guys.

2066
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:40,690
That's the...

2067
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:45,930
Guys, I only lost because I just wanted to farm some content.

2068
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:51,450
I can't, like, use the transform before anything.

2069
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:54,670
I need to get rid of him, though.

2070
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:56,170
This guy is pissing me off.

2071
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:56,630
Wow!

2072
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:58,570
Okay.

2073
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:02,250
Alright, I guess we do that again.

2074
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:07,310
I'm always two steps ahead, guys.

2075
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:08,950
Two steps ahead.

2076
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:12,250
Alright.

2077
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:14,210
Off back at it again.

2078
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,510
Guys, I failed it out there before content chat.

2079
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:20,350
Because I knew that people would be like, hee hee ha ha.

2080
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:21,030
And then...

2081
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:26,470
And then viewship goes up.

2082
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,290
Two steps ahead.

2083
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:31,070
I'm always two steps ahead.

2084
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,070
Alright, where the fuck is this goddamn frog?

2085
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:39,250
Okay, this way.

2086
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,350
Alright, there he is.

2087
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,430
There he fucking is.

2088
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:46,270
Looking at me like that.

2089
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,590
God dammit, I'm coming over.

2090
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:50,670
Alright.

2091
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:52,250
Nice.

2092
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:53,890
Heavy attack!

2093
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:54,810
Heavy attack!

2094
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:57,890
Oh shit!

2095
01:27:57,970 --> 01:27:58,910
Did I hit that?

2096
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:00,710
I hope I did.

2097
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:03,470
Oh shit, okay.

2098
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:05,150
This guy does so much damage.

2099
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:05,870
Holy shit.

2100
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:07,630
It's okay.

2101
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:09,930
Alright, that's fine.

2102
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:10,470
That's fine.

2103
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:12,290
It's not my actual HP anyway.

2104
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:15,630
It's not my actual HP anyway.

2105
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:16,090
That's fine.

2106
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:20,250
That's fine.

2107
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:21,950
We're still in it.

2108
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,550
We're still in it!

2109
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,030
That's fucking...

2110
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:26,010
Alright, now we're not.

2111
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:26,830
Now we're not.

2112
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:28,050
And now I transform.

2113
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:29,790
Wait, I have been done!

2114
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:31,490
Baby, it's a kind of bug!

2115
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:32,430
No!

2116
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,510
No, I forgot about baby!

2117
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:35,710
No!

2118
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,790
He crashed me!

2119
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:39,190
I did not!

2120
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,800
Did he crash me?

2121
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:53,660
Where did my HP go?

2122
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,380
Where did it all go?

2123
01:28:59,260 --> 01:28:59,800
Bugs!

2124
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:01,160
Hey.

2125
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,600
She's always three steps ahead, guys.

2126
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,580
Three steps ahead.

2127
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,040
Three steps ahead.

2128
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,160
Okay.

2129
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,100
Back at her.

2130
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,840
I wish the frog was closer.

2131
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:19,840
Oh my god.

2132
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,140
Kyle, thank you for the super chat.

2133
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:21,880
Thank you, thank you.

2134
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:22,960
It makes you feel any better.

2135
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:27,080
There are two more frogs and you can cultivate the spirit to make it stronger.

2136
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,000
What?

2137
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,940
Why are the frogs so strong?

2138
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,100
Bro, I'm already having a bad day, bro!

2139
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,400
Fuck off!

2140
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,060
Actually...

2141
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,520
Fuck off.

2142
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:47,700
Alright, not cool, bro.

2143
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:49,280
Not fucking cool.

2144
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,000
Guys, it's been a while.

2145
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,160
So I need to use the...

2146
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,860
I need to remember to use the baby.

2147
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:58,860
Okay.

2148
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,340
Alright.

2149
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,700
Here we go.

2150
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:02,960
Here we go again.

2151
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,160
Jesus Christ.

2152
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:05,680
Okay.

2153
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,660
Oh my god, why are you so...

2154
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:10,100
Why are you just slapping me?

2155
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:12,220
Oh shit.

2156
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:17,140
He's so fucking strong.

2157
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,440
Okay, that's fine.

2158
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,240
That's fine.

2159
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,100
He's just slapping, too.

2160
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,920
Like, he's just slapping.

2161
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:29,540
Okay, here we go again.

2162
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,740
We got a lot of progress done.

2163
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:34,560
Nice.

2164
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,240
Nice, alright, here we go.

2165
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:38,800
This is fine.

2166
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,580
We made a lot of progress.

2167
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,480
It's alright.

2168
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,120
And then big baby time.

2169
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,400
Big baby!

2170
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:47,640
That's fucking right!

2171
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:49,220
And then one!

2172
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:56,040
Alright, okay, now we just gotta make sure he doesn't start boring.

2173
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,080
Like, that's...

2174
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,120
That's really it!

2175
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,980
Oh my god.

2176
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:02,900
Please, sir.

2177
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:03,980
Please.

2178
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,080
Please, I beg of you.

2179
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:10,880
I... Please, how did you do that much damage?!

2180
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,220
Are you fucking kidding me?!

2181
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:15,540
Stop!

2182
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,120
Please... Please...

2183
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:24,280
Ow!

2184
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:25,800
Ow!

2185
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,740
Oh my god.

2186
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,240
Oh my god, please, I don't want to be any more steps ahead.

2187
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,580
Oh no!

2188
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:43,670
He fucking grabbed me!

2189
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,770
I got his frog!

2190
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:57,890
Stupid fucking...

2191
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,980
I can't believe he grabbed me.

2192
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,000
I do okay on the others!

2193
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:07,000
It's just...

2194
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,180
The frogs are like my kryptonite.

2195
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:10,900
I don't know what it is about them.

2196
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,980
Like, they just do these frog things and I don't know what to do.

2197
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:22,680
I don't know what to do when he starts doing frog things.

2198
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,140
They... They just...

2199
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,480
Just exist and I don't know!

2200
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:31,880
Frozen, thank you for the...

2201
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:32,920
Oh my god, I went the wrong way.

2202
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:33,960
Thank you for the super chat.

2203
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:34,340
Thank you.

2204
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:34,960
Thank you.

2205
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:39,580
This has shown us that frogs are the real ultimate life form.

2206
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,480
Reject monkey.

2207
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,220
Oh my god, thank you for the super chat.

2208
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:46,660
Thank you.

2209
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,280
Thank you.

2210
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:50,180
Yoko, thank you for the super chat.

2211
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:50,560
Thank you.

2212
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:50,960
Thank you.

2213
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,140
It's always the frogs.

2214
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,240
Zeon, thank you for the super chat.

2215
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:55,720
Thank you.

2216
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:56,400
Thank you.

2217
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:58,780
If it's any consolation to the last two...

2218
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:00,220
There's more frogs?

2219
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:03,260
Like... Oh my god!

2220
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,560
Somebody stop these frogs!

2221
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:10,080
Find where they live!

2222
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:16,720
Somebody stop them before it's too late.

2223
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,880
Find where... Find the babies.

Smells.

2233
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:38,780
Sounds.

2234
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:39,760
Sounds.

2235
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:40,440
Sounds.

2236
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,720
Like remained, pieces.

2237
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:49,980
Like...

2238
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,020
I was so scared.

2239
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:55,440
I was so scared of missing because I was like, that seems like something I would do, you know?

2240
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,680
Oh god, please.

2241
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,520
Please.

2242
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:03,420
Please, I'm trying to regen right now.

2243
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

2244
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,740
I keep fucking spitting, so god, okay.

2245
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:11,780
Okay.

2246
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,120
Okay.

2247
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:16,460
Okay.

2248
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,320
Like, what is that?

2249
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,080
Okay.

2250
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,200
I can't even hit him!

2251
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,420
Oh my god, please.

2252
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:28,660
Stop!

2253
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:31,560
Oh no.

2254
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:33,760
No!

2255
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:35,420
Deepfucking...

2256
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:36,280
No!

2257
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,400
No.

2258
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:39,700
No!

2259
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,360
Leave me alone, please!

2260
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:42,620
Just leave me alone!

2261
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,580
I can barely hit him!

2262
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:51,760
Jesus Christ!

2263
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,320
God damn it, please!

2264
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,420
He has a belly flop!

2265
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,000
No, no, no, no.

2266
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:06,360
He has a belly flop!

2267
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:09,620
Oh my god, bro.

2268
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:12,780
What the fuck are his attacks, man?

2269
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:17,980
No, please!

2270
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:18,360
Please!

2271
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:20,180
Oh my god!

2272
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:20,540
No!

2273
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:22,580
Oh!

2274
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,720
Oh, we did it!

2275
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:26,780
We did it!

2276
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,500
We're four steps ahead!

2277
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,120
Oh my god, and I took his kids, too!

2278
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,700
Damn right, I'm gonna fucking steal your children!

2279
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,640
I'm gonna steal your children!

2280
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:38,680
Burrito!

2281
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:39,900
Thank you for the super chat!

2282
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:40,820
Thank you, thank you!

2283
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,400
I have to say, she is too weak.

2284
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:45,260
I've seen girls play Black Muffin.

2285
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,520
Their invasion skills are good.

2286
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:47,620
But Doki died.

2287
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:47,960
I'm fine.

2288
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:48,560
Four times!

2289
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,060
Jayden, update your meme!

2290
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:55,120
To a damn ice cream parlor!

2291
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:57,880
I have to say, Doki's skill is too bad.

2292
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,060
Is she deliberately profaming?

2293
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,020
Being abused to increase viewers?

2294
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:05,300
Thank you for the magenta soup.

2295
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,200
Thank you, thank you.

2296
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,300
Oh my god.

2297
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,800
That's fucking right.

2298
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:12,880
I stole his kids.

2299
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,140
Thank fucking god I stole his...

2300
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:16,760
Oh, and then there's...

2301
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:17,600
Oh my god, please.

2302
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:18,800
Instant transmission.

2303
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,280
I can't.

2304
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:23,140
I need a heal.

2305
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,900
I need a heal.

2306
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:27,940
Affiliate, thank you for the 10 gifted shoes.

2307
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,000
Thank you, thank you.

2308
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,260
Alright.

2309
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:33,520
At least I got my heals in.

2310
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,180
Oh, thank god.

2311
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:35,960
Okay.

2312
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:37,880
Oh, travel.

2313
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,060
And then we'll go back to there.

2314
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,720
Yeah, I saw it.

2315
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,800
He ate the left hand bug.

2316
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,340
Oh, he ate the twin brother!

2317
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,200
Hey, at least we'll see each other in heaven.

2318
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,640
Or hell, I don't know where the monsters go.

2319
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:55,860
Where the guys go.

2320
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:58,100
Okay.

2321
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:00,760
Alright.

2322
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,640
This is... Oh, there he is!

2323
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:04,520
We're here!

2324
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,640
We're here for the wedding!

2325
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,980
Woah, why is this so quiet?

2326
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,680
I thought this was a wedding, girls.

2327
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:12,660
Ladies, ladies.

2328
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:13,560
Woah.

2329
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:16,880
What's going on?

2330
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,140
I thought this was a wedding.

2331
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,420
I thought this was a banquet.

2332
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:22,960
Where's the food?

2333
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:37,550
Oh.

2334
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:40,850
Was it that good?

2335
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:43,390
Oh, it was that good.

2336
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,920
He's like, why did you interrupt my...

2337
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,280
Bro, I'm sorry!

2338
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:11,180
Bro, you told me to call you, bro!

2339
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,520
I didn't know you didn't give me a sign!

2340
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:14,000
It was...

2341
01:38:23,050 --> 01:38:23,970
Oh my god, bro!

2342
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:25,210
I didn't know, bro!

2343
01:38:26,350 --> 01:38:28,370
You didn't give me the signal, bro!

2344
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:31,190
I still... You still needed me there!

2345
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:32,830
Bro, I didn't know!

2346
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:37,110
Bro, I didn't know!

2347
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:37,890
Bro, I'm sorry!

2348
01:38:38,270 --> 01:38:39,730
You can go back to the granny!

2349
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:41,870
Oh, shit!

2350
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:43,490
Oh my god, he is mad!

2351
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:45,910
He is actually... I'm so sorry, man.

2352
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:46,690
He is so mad.

2353
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:48,290
He's so mad at me, guys.

2354
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:50,390
I interrupted him.

2355
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:51,810
I'm so sorry.

2356
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:57,350
Bro, you didn't leave the sock!

2357
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:00,270
How was I supposed to know, Juwaka?

2358
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:02,350
You didn't leave the sock or anything!

2359
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:05,150
Like, I... I wouldn't know!

2360
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:08,470
Oh my god.

2361
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:13,190
Oh, this was a bad time for me.

2362
01:39:13,330 --> 01:39:14,190
That's for sure.

2363
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:17,670
Holy shit, now he's spitting!

2364
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:20,850
Okay, nice.

2365
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:25,010
Bam!

2366
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:26,330
Alright, nice.

2367
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,810
Okay.

2368
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:28,270
I need to regen, though.

2369
01:39:29,710 --> 01:39:30,730
Oh, he's spitting.

2370
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:32,390
Oh, what the fuck!

2371
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:35,050
The spin-spin.

2372
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:35,890
Did she tell you that?

2373
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:37,130
I've never seen that move before.

2374
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:38,210
Holy shit.

2375
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:39,670
The granny did teach you new stuff.

2376
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:43,770
Oh my god.

2377
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:46,830
Granny did teach you some new moves, bro.

2378
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:51,850
In battle, too?

2379
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:52,830
Like...

2380
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:55,610
Spin to win.

2381
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:00,570
Yeah.

2382
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:01,930
Yeah.

2383
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:16,180
Well that'd be pretty sweet, right?

2384
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,820
That'd be pretty cool.

2385
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:19,140
Yeah.

2386
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:20,780
I'm really 발 judged today.

2387
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:23,700
You guys are in your th Commercials newsroom on Slack for our show.

2388
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:23,700
My

2389
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:33,160
character is the ghost behaviors!

2390
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:33,220
See, that's what's so funny!

2391
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:41,280
But like, in the beginning, it was only things that I couldUBor house as a child.

2392
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:41,360
Sometimes you just wait, and then make a relationship, or have a relationship.

2393
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,440
We made a group and we match up.

2394
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:43,900
Then you come out of the two, and they're like...

2395
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:44,400
All out!

2396
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:46,580
And I was like...

2397
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:47,380
You're definitely not 15, right Yeah, actually I am 15.

2398
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:49,580
Broke the ultimate bro code!

2399
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:53,600
You let a hoe get in between the bros!

2400
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,300
Give me a sec, I'm breaking a few pots.

2401
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,660
Broke the bro code.

2402
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,980
Alright, can't be that good, bro!

2403
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:14,500
Bro, we need to play... What happened to GameCube night, man?

2404
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,840
What am I gonna play GameCube with next?

2405
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:20,700
I'm gonna play on the Xbox with Halo!

2406
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,780
Where do I go?

2407
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:25,480
Left or right?

2408
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,860
Like, where did he fly to?

2409
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:35,620
Up?

2410
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:36,240
Oh, okay.

2411
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:38,060
I couldn't tell where he flew to.

2412
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:41,700
Up here?

2413
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,120
Oh.

2414
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:45,160
Go in.

2415
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,660
Oh shit, I should have healed.

2416
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:51,840
Okay.

2417
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:54,800
We don't hang out anymore, bro.

2418
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:57,440
Okay, let's go back in here.

2419
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:59,280
What about LAN nights, bro?

2420
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:04,420
Ever since you met that... that granny spider lady.

2421
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,420
We don't do LAN nights anymore.

2422
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,980
You always say, like, next time.

2423
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:12,680
But that's... that's been two... that's been two months, bro.

2424
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,440
When will we ever have next time?

2425
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:16,620
Hahahaha!

2426
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:16,900
Hahahaha!

2427
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:28,820
The bro's been offline for seven years!

2428
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:32,480
Oh, that hurt, man.

2429
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:36,640
You've been offline for seven years, bro.

2430
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,060
I haven't seen you on the Xbox last online.

2431
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,360
Seven years ago.

2432
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:53,640
I like how the music got a little depressing, too.

2433
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:54,480
Hahahaha!

2434
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,100
Hahahaha!

2435
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:57,880
It's always you two.

2436
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:59,680
When is it us two?

2437
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,540
Bro, when I said I wanted to hang out, I didn't mean you have to bring her along.

2438
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:08,660
Hahahaha!

2439
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:22,440
Getting too real.

2440
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,620
Oh my god, again?

2441
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:30,100
Are you dead?

2442
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:36,330
My love, this is all because of you!

2443
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:43,470
Real homies are happy for them, but it doesn't hurt less!

2444
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:49,630
You're going to just abandon me, you bitch.

2445
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:51,770
You won't make me leave, again?

2446
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:55,830
Bro, I can still be in your life, bro.

2447
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:59,290
Like... You don't have to choose me or her.

2448
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:01,470
I just need to!

2449
01:44:01,650 --> 01:44:02,010
Bro!

2450
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:03,550
Bro, Mad Nights, man!

2451
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:07,510
Jesus, why is he so tanky?

2452
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:09,910
Holy shit!

2453
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:14,070
Wait, he's actually so tanky, guys.

2454
01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:15,470
Like, my shit...

2455
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:19,950
We just miss you, bro!

2456
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:21,610
Like...

2457
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:27,290
You haven't... you haven't seen your friends in, like, months, man!

2458
01:44:28,510 --> 01:44:31,010
Like, we just wanna know what's going on!

2459
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:34,130
Like, you need a life outside of her, too!

2460
01:44:34,570 --> 01:44:36,710
It's not just... her!

2461
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:41,450
Okay.

2462
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:46,390
I'm gonna make sure I have my stamina, too.

2463
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:52,070
Is there no joy for me then?

2464
01:44:52,110 --> 01:44:54,070
There's no joy for anyone!

2465
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:56,370
Shit!

2466
01:44:56,710 --> 01:44:57,730
That's real.

2467
01:44:57,950 --> 01:44:59,150
That's so real.

2468
01:44:59,310 --> 01:45:00,450
Oh my god.

2469
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:03,890
That's so fucking real.

2470
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:06,830
Holy shit, man.

2471
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:08,730
Oh my god.

2472
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:14,730
Oh my god, it's so hard to roll!

2473
01:45:15,370 --> 01:45:18,230
The mud is making it so hard to roll!

2474
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:23,210
Wait, did I get a halfway point?

2475
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:23,930
Is it phase two?

2476
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:27,990
Thank god, Mime.

2477
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:29,310
That's messed up.

2478
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:35,250
The face too?

2479
01:45:46,610 --> 01:45:48,410
What the fuck is go- Bro, you okay?

2480
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:49,690
Ohh!

2481
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:52,110
He got- He's got the real ping in him!

2482
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:52,830
Bro!

2483
01:45:55,290 --> 01:45:58,270
He's- Morb he's got- Oh my god, he's going feral.

2484
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:59,970
He's going feral for her!

2485
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:01,370
Bro!

2486
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:02,590
We can share!

2487
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:05,950
We can share time together, man!

2488
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:10,230
Like, I- I'm not trying to say, like, God ping you!

2489
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:10,970
Me or her!

2490
01:46:11,230 --> 01:46:13,290
Like we... I'm just saying!

2491
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:15,030
You're fully picking her!

2492
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:19,970
And like, we just were just concerned!

2493
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:25,850
Holy shit!

2494
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:27,650
How do I...

2495
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:36,260
I awakened the inner pig.

2496
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:37,880
You went full feral.

2497
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,760
Like it's not healthy, bro!

2498
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:50,560
Oh my god!

2499
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:53,200
That was... that was hard!

2500
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:57,620
The mud is so hard to... hard to like dodge.

2501
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:05,190
Take his wife's name out of your mouth.

2502
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:09,450
You went full hog.

2503
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:16,620
Yeah, the mud fight... the mud part was really hard.

2504
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:16,980
It was really difficult.

2505
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,140
I didn't know how to dodge that.

2506
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:23,600
Alright, he's... he's... he's... he's fucking a spirit form right now.

2507
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:26,120
What?

2508
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,100
Oh wait, he does?

2509
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:27,840
That's fucked.

2510
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:28,920
That's mad.

2511
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,860
That's... that's fucked up, bro.

2512
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:34,620
Like, how was I supposed to know you were gonna do that?

2513
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:37,220
Oh my god.

2514
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:38,200
Wait, what?

2515
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,860
I've never seen that before!

2516
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,160
What the fuck is that?

2517
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:45,740
That's new.

2518
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,460
Holy... that was new.

2519
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,840
I was not ready for that.

2520
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,980
Wait, what can I... oh, I can't even fight him outside.

2521
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,720
I have to fight him in the mud.

2522
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,740
Ooh, I think that's the worst part.

2523
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:59,640
How the fuck... how is he... like... fish?

2524
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:06,100
I've never seen the fish form until now.

2525
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:11,160
How many patterns does he have?

2526
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:13,820
No, not the tornado!

2527
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,220
Okay, thank god.

2528
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:16,460
Okay, he messed up the tornado.

2529
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:17,880
Oh no.

2530
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:18,940
Oh no.

2531
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:21,300
Okay.

2532
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:23,380
Okay.

2533
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:24,220
Please, let me...

2534
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,140
Okay, nice.

2535
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:26,740
I got it.

2536
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:28,680
I need a heal though.

2537
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:30,980
Nice.

2538
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,380
Okay, he's got that pig in him.

2539
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,060
He can transform, yeah.

2540
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:41,780
Is this what hag might actually does to a bro?

2541
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:42,900
Bro.

2542
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:44,940
Okay.

2543
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:47,720
Guys, I don't want to see his pig form again.

2544
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:52,240
He can, like, be here.

2545
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:54,180
Wow!

2546
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:58,100
Okay, that... I got fucked up by the camera, guys.

2547
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,260
You guys can't blame me for that.

2548
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,500
The camera actually fucked me up, bro.

2549
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:07,240
What?!

2550
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:09,360
That's messed up.

2551
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:12,260
No, not the catfish.

2552
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,040
No.

2553
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:13,180
No.

2554
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,280
Not the fish.

2555
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:15,580
Not the fish!

2556
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:16,560
Okay.

2557
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,400
Can I, like, be here?

2558
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:21,180
Would I be fine?

2559
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:22,280
I think so.

2560
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:23,660
Nice.

2561
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:24,240
Okay.

2562
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:26,180
Nice.

2563
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:27,580
Okay, I got that hit in though.

2564
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,720
Oh, I didn't mean to heal, but that's alright.

2565
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:32,920
Okay.

2566
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:33,920
I think I'm...

2567
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,340
What the fuck?

2568
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:37,340
He's a rhino?!

2569
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,640
Oh my god!

2570
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:46,840
Oh my god, there's so many rhinos!

2571
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,040
Oh shit!

2572
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,280
Oh shit!

2573
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:49,940
Okay.

2574
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:51,240
Okay.

2575
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:53,420
This transformation is bullshit.

2576
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:55,320
But what...

2577
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,860
How did she able to do that when he met her?

2578
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:02,160
What the fuck?

2579
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,820
You've been holding out on me?!

2580
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:07,300
You learned all these moves for her?!

2581
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:12,960
God, I can't dodge jack shit.

2582
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:15,840
Okay.

2583
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:16,280
Okay.

2584
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:17,420
Okay.

2585
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,020
Okay.

2586
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:19,120
No, no no.

2587
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:19,220
Please, please.

2588
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:20,640
Please.

2589
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:21,360
Please, he's so low.

2590
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:22,520
Yes!

2591
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:23,240
Oh my god!

2592
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:23,780
No!

2593
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:25,020
No.

2594
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:25,180
No.

2595
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:25,340
No.

2596
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:25,460
No.

2597
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:25,680
No.

2598
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:26,240
No.

2599
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:26,260
No.

2600
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:27,760
No.

2601
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:28,120
No.

2602
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:28,160
No.

2603
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,160
WHAT AM I MISSING?!

2604
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:33,600
WHAT?!

2605
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:35,820
HE'S LIKE WHAT?!

2606
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,260
YOU SHOULD BE DEAD!

2607
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:47,100
I KNOW WHAT HE SAID!

2608
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:47,840
YOU SHOULD BE DEAD!

2609
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:49,440
YOU SHOULD BE DEAD!

2610
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:55,100
HE GOT AWAY?!

2611
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:57,480
Okay, that's actually bullshit.

2612
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,940
That's actually bullshit.

2613
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,500
HE DOESN'T STOP!

2614
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:07,860
Now, there we go.

2615
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,280
There we go!

2616
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,800
It sounds like...

2617
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:12,980
Oh my gosh!

2618
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:14,880
I'm sorry!

2619
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:17,420
I'm sorry for insulting your girlfriend, bro.

2620
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:18,200
Or your wife.

2621
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:18,880
I'm sorry!

2622
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:37,720
Bro goes down when he goes down.

2623
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,180
Look at yourself!

2624
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:43,700
Look at yourself!

2625
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:44,180
Look what you became!

2626
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:47,400
Look what you became!

2627
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,220
Look at what granny!

2628
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:52,060
Look at what granny!

2629
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:52,480
Granny spider!

2630
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:54,320
Made you!

2631
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,400
What the fuck?

2632
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:57,320
You used to be like him.

2633
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,300
There's a broken chain.

2634
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:07,120
Look what it glanced into you!

2635
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,220
He was hot?

2636
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:13,320
Bro.

2637
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:17,700
Always has been.

2638
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:24,860
What do you mean, was?

2639
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:32,470
Oh my gosh, she took him back.

2640
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:37,090
Every time we have a breakthrough, she takes him back.

2641
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:38,790
And then I have to start all over again.

2642
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:49,580
Alright, nice.

2643
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:52,700
We got the bloodstained needle.

2644
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,000
Anything I have to get from here?

2645
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:59,580
Not again.

2646
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:00,200
No!

2647
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,780
I had a breakthrough!

2648
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:07,820
Now she's got it and lit her eight legs on him again!

2649
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:09,700
Alright.

2650
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,000
We open this chest.

2651
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:15,000
Round two.

2652
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:16,560
I think we're past round two.

2653
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:18,840
I didn't break any chains.

2654
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:21,280
We took a while to get to him, guys.

2655
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:24,780
I don't think he's at... There's definitely not single digits anymore.

2656
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:25,800
Alright.

2657
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,340
Craft armor.

2658
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:32,700
Nice.

2659
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,720
We have new... We finally have new armor.

2660
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:36,880
40.

2661
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,380
Pure broken mask.

2662
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,480
Mud that stains.

2663
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:41,580
Damage reductions.

2664
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:42,380
Oh, okay.

2665
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,520
Oh, 79!

2666
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:46,900
Let's fucking go.

2667
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:47,660
Let's go.

2668
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:49,660
Confirmed.

2669
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:51,800
Oh, I look so badass with the new one.

2670
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:56,300
Confirmed.

2671
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,360
And then...

2672
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:00,940
Wait, what am I missing?

2673
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:01,740
Find gold thread?

2674
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,240
Can I buy that?

2675
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:05,780
Find gold thread.

2676
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:07,520
Oh, I can.

2677
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:07,980
Nice.

2678
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:09,000
Wait, I can?

2679
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:10,660
It's sold out?

2680
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:12,300
No!

2681
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,560
It is sold out!

2682
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:17,890
Sell out!

2683
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:23,930
Is that hard to spin gold?

2684
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:31,450
What do you mean?

2685
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:36,350
Wait, this tiger has... Oh, you're right.

2686
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:37,230
Tiger might have some.

2687
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:39,530
I'll go visit a tiger.

2688
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:45,680
I can't believe it.

2689
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,180
Who bought all the gold threads?

2690
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:48,820
Who bought it?

2691
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,640
I don't think you need it more than me, guys.

2692
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:56,020
I don't I'm on a mission to save a bro right now.

2693
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:58,460
Are you on a mission to save a bro?

2694
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:04,720
Tiger does it?

2695
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:05,980
God damn it.

2696
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:08,060
What's the point?

2697
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,400
I guess I'll go back then.

2698
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,260
I guess...

2699
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:14,020
Oh yeah, I'll get in chapter five then.

2700
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,220
Alright, let's see.

2701
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:20,160
I'm gonna go grab some water.

2702
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:21,160
I'll be right back.

2703
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:23,540
Yeah, I fought him.

2704
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:25,780
He broke my PC, but I fought him.

2705
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:40,310
My PC has never been the same since I fought that guy.

2706
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:43,330
He legitimately fucked it up.

2707
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:44,330
I don't know what he did.

2708
01:55:44,930 --> 01:55:46,890
But my PC has never been the same.

2709
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:56,580
Alright, stay hydrated, everybody.

2710
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,300
Oh, I commissioned some new emotes.

2711
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:04,080
I commissioned ten new emotes yesterday.

2712
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:08,960
I don't know when they'll be done, but look forward to some new emotes when they get here.

2713
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,280
They might not be done for a bit though, because artists are busy, busy.

2714
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:16,420
Let's see.

2715
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:17,120
Where do I go?

2716
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:19,720
Absorb.

2717
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:27,810
Please don't tell me there's a phase three.

2718
01:56:30,130 --> 01:56:30,570
Whoa.

2719
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:32,050
Statues.

2720
01:56:35,490 --> 01:56:37,110
There are places I... Where do I go?

2721
01:56:38,770 --> 01:56:40,750
Alan and Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

2722
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:41,670
Thank you, thank you.

2723
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:44,650
It's so quiet.

2724
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:45,570
I don't like that.

2725
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:50,270
I don't like how quiet it is here.

2726
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:52,010
Whoa!

2727
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:53,170
I didn't see this guy.

2728
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:54,950
Get over here.

2729
01:56:56,110 --> 01:56:56,870
Alright, nice.

2730
01:56:59,290 --> 01:56:59,750
Spoilers?

2731
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:01,850
One of them?

2732
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:03,070
What did I...

2733
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:04,410
Oh, one of them is the loading.

2734
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:08,930
So when I'm AFK, it'll be the loading emote.

2735
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:10,370
That's one of them.

2736
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:14,720
That's all I'll tell you.

2737
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:25,000
But like, for the first time in a long time, I'm actually catching up.

2738
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:26,840
I'm actually almost caught up with everything.

2739
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:32,700
It's been so long since I've had like the...

2740
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,240
Wait, who's shooting me?

2741
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:41,640
I've been able to have that, you know, being able to catch up to myself.

2742
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,660
Who's he?

2743
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:44,360
Is he bad guy?

2744
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:47,880
Are you a bad guy?

2745
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,240
Oh.

2746
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:51,160
Okay.

2747
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,720
That's not creepy at all.

2748
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:55,740
Gather?

2749
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:57,800
What am I gathering?

2750
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:00,520
Shock.

2751
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:01,740
Shack.

2752
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:02,200
Pusk.

2753
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:02,760
Choice.

2754
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:03,920
What is that?

2755
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:06,600
What the fuck did I put in my hand?

2756
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:12,420
Not some dead foot!

2757
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:13,920
I'm not gonna read that out loud!

2758
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:16,360
But thank you for the super chat!

2759
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:17,000
Thank you!

2760
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:18,760
Oh, hey!

2761
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:19,840
Lightman!

2762
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:26,200
This is like his minimum wage job and I'm ruining it for him.

2763
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,220
I'm like this punk that decided like...

2764
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:28,960
He's like that!

2765
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:30,300
He's like those like...

2766
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:37,020
Horror... you know like those people working at haunted houses and then I'm that guy that punched him.

2767
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:39,720
Like that's basically what's going on.

2768
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:46,720
I'm that freak that punched a haunted house employee.

2769
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:47,780
Like...

2770
01:58:53,940 --> 01:58:58,420
You know like now you have to sign... whenever you go on a haunted house you have a lot...

2771
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:13,380
Not a lot but some haunted houses now you have to sign a contract or a waiver where like you're not allowed to like they can pursue legal action on you if you punch the haunted house like scarers.

2772
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:14,520
Yeah!

2773
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,560
Cause people do that!

2774
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:16,300
People like...

2775
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:17,940
Cause you know you're scaring them.

2776
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:20,140
So like you know they do fight or flight.

2777
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:26,060
So then sometimes you know you get pushed or like punched if you're working at a haunted house.

2778
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:28,620
So now like you have to actually sign waivers now.

2779
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:30,060
So like you're like okay.

2780
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:37,720
Like you're not allowed to punch or push or like touch touch the people doing like the scares.

2781
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:40,440
Or like you have to pay like a fine.

2782
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,740
Which is understandable!

2783
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:49,410
Whoa.

2784
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:51,170
Oh there's a big scorpion man.

2785
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:52,590
I don't like how there's so many eggs here.

2786
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:53,530
I should upgrade.

2787
01:59:53,870 --> 01:59:54,770
Almost forgot to upgrade.

2788
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:58,830
Okay I gotta make sure to upgrade these too.

2789
02:00:01,010 --> 02:00:02,010
Self advance.

2790
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:04,010
Okay what do I wanna advance?

2791
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:07,830
I guess like my stuff here.

2792
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:10,210
Oh my god I have not advanced these.

2793
02:00:10,450 --> 02:00:11,050
Definitely.

2794
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:13,350
Let's see.

2795
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:15,590
Each tile increases the charging.

2796
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:16,170
Okay yeah.

2797
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:19,150
I feel like I should charge that up.

2798
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:24,210
Reduces the...

2799
02:00:24,210 --> 02:00:24,770
Okay.

2800
02:00:25,070 --> 02:00:27,230
Yeah I don't wanna take less of that.

2801
02:00:27,550 --> 02:00:30,150
And then perfect dodges.

2802
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:31,890
Stamina cost.

2803
02:00:31,890 --> 02:00:32,870
When health.

2804
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:35,890
Each tile increases stamina when health is above half.

2805
02:00:37,130 --> 02:00:39,190
I don't wanna upgrade.

2806
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:41,470
Oh critical hit.

2807
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:42,890
You know I don't get critical hit.

2808
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:45,810
Ooh.

2809
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:47,050
Absorb.

2810
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:48,890
Okay.

2811
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:49,810
Oh shit!

2812
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:51,150
The fuck?

2813
02:00:51,390 --> 02:00:52,010
That's creepy.

2814
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:54,270
That's creepy.

2815
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:56,910
The ladies don't like that.

2816
02:00:59,230 --> 02:00:59,830
Whoa.

2817
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:01,590
What the fuck?

2818
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:02,250
Why did you see me there?

2819
02:01:05,450 --> 02:01:06,410
That's fucking right.

2820
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:07,490
I'm gonna go right in.

2821
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,130
Oh shit!

2822
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:09,690
Okay.

2823
02:01:09,830 --> 02:01:10,490
Guess not.

2824
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:13,850
I guess I don't go right in.

2825
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:16,090
Oh my god.

2826
02:01:16,330 --> 02:01:17,790
Oh my god I do so...

2827
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:18,570
Oh my god!

2828
02:01:19,050 --> 02:01:20,590
Why do you do so much damage?

2829
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:23,970
Okay nice.

2830
02:01:24,170 --> 02:01:24,630
He's dead.

2831
02:01:25,350 --> 02:01:27,830
Jesus Christ I took so much damage there.

2832
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:28,630
Is it because of him?

2833
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:30,530
Oh I'm coming over.

2834
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:32,650
Oh you made a mistake bitch.

2835
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:34,490
You fucking made... Oh yeah!

2836
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:35,250
Yeah it was him.

2837
02:01:35,370 --> 02:01:36,110
Guys it was...

2838
02:01:36,110 --> 02:01:38,330
Guys it was definitely him.

2839
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:39,010
Now I know.

2840
02:01:39,190 --> 02:01:41,230
Now I realize why.

2841
02:01:41,570 --> 02:01:42,570
I was like what?

2842
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:44,810
How did I lose like half my HP?

2843
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:48,090
That makes more sense.

2844
02:01:48,570 --> 02:01:49,710
I was so confused.

2845
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:54,250
Alright.

2846
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:58,710
Stop bro get some help.

2847
02:01:59,830 --> 02:02:02,450
Ladies don't like it when you stand there in the dark man.

2848
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:07,710
Alright.

2849
02:02:07,890 --> 02:02:08,750
If you think...

2850
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:10,790
If you think it's the lady's fault.

2851
02:02:11,150 --> 02:02:12,310
That like...

2852
02:02:13,510 --> 02:02:16,250
That you haven't got anybody yet.

2853
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:17,750
Maybe don't stand in the dark.

2854
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:19,170
Waiting for me to show up.

2855
02:02:26,620 --> 02:02:27,140
Alright.

2856
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,800
Oh no not you.

2857
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,100
God damn it.

2858
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:31,440
Alright.

2859
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:32,060
It's alright.

2860
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:32,960
He can't touch me.

2861
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:35,260
Oh shit there he goes.

2862
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:38,120
Unless you're Batman.

2863
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:40,640
But I don't think... I don't think that guy was Batman guys.

2864
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:41,620
I...

2865
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:44,460
Guys I don't think he was Batman.

2866
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:47,780
Unless you have millions of dollars.

2867
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:48,760
Or billions.

2868
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,100
And you can stand there in the creepy hallway.

2869
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:54,440
Wait what the... Oh it's him.

2870
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:56,060
It's like what?

2871
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:58,260
These guys are so weak.

2872
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:02,040
Alright.

2873
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:08,350
I'm not afraid of these guys.

2874
02:03:08,430 --> 02:03:09,790
Because they're so easy to kill.

2875
02:03:10,870 --> 02:03:11,350
Alright.

2876
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:11,910
Up we go.

2877
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:14,170
I'm still trying to journey to find my bro.

2878
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:19,710
I haven't seen him since he met that spider granny.

2879
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:20,850
Two years ago.

2880
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:26,920
The bro.

2881
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,700
Journey to the bro.

2882
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:32,840
It's not journey to the west anymore guys.

2883
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:35,520
It's not journey to the west anymore guys.

2884
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:36,200
Alright.

2885
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:36,680
Alright.

2886
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:37,380
Up we go.

2887
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:39,720
Up we go.

2888
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:44,860
Still up we go.

2889
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:47,120
Jesus how fucking high is this mountain?

2890
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:48,100
Jesus how fucking high is this mountain?

2891
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:58,560
Bro first before the west.

2892
02:03:58,580 --> 02:03:58,700
Bro first before the west.

2893
02:03:58,700 --> 02:03:59,120
True.

2894
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:04,880
I told you guys.

2895
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:06,820
I told you guys.

2896
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:07,240
This is the bro code.

2897
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,700
I ain't breaking that shit.

2898
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:17,520
Stay hydrated.

2899
02:04:21,150 --> 02:04:21,870
Alright.

2900
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:22,490
Nice.

2901
02:04:22,990 --> 02:04:24,690
We gotta go this way.

2902
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:29,380
Hello?

2903
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:30,640
Bro?

2904
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:34,020
Bro?

2905
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:39,580
I'm knocking just to make sure you guys have time.

2906
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:40,000
I'm knocking just to make sure you guys have time.

2907
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:40,460
To like...

2908
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:44,320
So I'm not interrupting anything.

2909
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:47,040
Back in the days of the monkey.

2910
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:48,380
Who was the one that saved me from being killed by a fool?

2911
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:51,720
Who was the one that didn't give you a hand in the end?

2912
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:56,500
I didn't forget.

2913
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:01,100
But what I can't forget is after you guys left.

2914
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:05,180
How I can get over the blood and flesh of the sisters.

2915
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:07,400
How I can get over the blood and flesh of the sisters.

2916
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:07,960
How I can get over the blood and flesh of the sisters.

2917
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:09,460
This grudge cannot be all on us.

2918
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:11,360
If you want to blame it, blame your bro.

2919
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:13,320
He was the one who put Tang Sen Rou

2920
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:32,380
We had a hundred kids, Chewbacca!

2921
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,100
Bros before hoes!

2922
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:51,840
You don't understand!

2923
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:57,880
I knew it bro!

2924
02:05:57,980 --> 02:06:00,080
I knew you wouldn't betray me bro!

2925
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:02,260
I knew it!

2926
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:07,040
He's still there!

2927
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:11,660
He's still there!

2928
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:28,240
He's just jealous of us bro!

2929
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:32,820
Wow bro!

2930
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:34,760
Do you still want me here?

2931
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,300
You guys are still not happy?

2932
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:49,900
You're not done?

2933
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:49,900
What?

2934
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:53,480
Who is she?

2935
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:55,680
Is that the newest daughter?

2936
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:57,500
What?

2937
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:05,440
What the fuck?

2938
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:06,440
Why did you make her?

2939
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,760
That's your dad that abandoned you.

2940
02:07:10,220 --> 02:07:12,720
Your father said you did!

2941
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,680
Oh shit!

2942
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:19,660
It's child support time!

2943
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,860
Why did your father hurt?

2944
02:07:28,820 --> 02:07:30,400
That's your kid!

2945
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:32,940
That's literally your kid!

2946
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:35,600
I hate monkeys!

2947
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:39,200
You guys always ruin my life!

2948
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:40,800
Pay up!

2949
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,040
It's time to pay up!

2950
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:43,760
He wants a DNA test!

2951
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:49,000
Hey!

2952
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:49,640
Hey!

2953
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:50,040
Hey!

2954
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:51,880
Wow!

2955
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:53,040
Wow!

2956
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:53,520
Wow!

2957
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:53,860
Bro!

2958
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:54,940
It's just... bro!

2959
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:55,700
Bro!

2960
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:57,220
Don't make this weird!

2961
02:07:57,720 --> 02:08:01,820
Oh my god!

2962
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:02,860
Don't make this weird!

2963
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:04,520
Why did you make this weird?

2964
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:08,620
We're just bros!

2965
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:09,660
Wait!

2966
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:10,820
What's the difference?

2967
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:13,720
I don't know.

2968
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:14,240
It's my fault!

2969
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:14,940
Bro!

2970
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:15,160
My fault!

2971
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:17,940
Bro!

2972
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:18,760
Bro.

2973
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:19,020
Dude.

2974
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:21,020
Bro!

2975
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:24,280
Bro!

2976
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:27,510
Oh shit!

2977
02:08:27,590 --> 02:08:28,390
That's a lot of damage.

2978
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:29,730
Nice.

2979
02:08:30,330 --> 02:08:31,690
That's so much, I just realized.

2980
02:08:32,090 --> 02:08:32,970
Oh my god!

2981
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:34,230
Cheat jobs?!

2982
02:08:34,230 --> 02:08:35,190
That's cheating.

2983
02:08:35,650 --> 02:08:36,970
That's cheating, actually.

2984
02:08:40,230 --> 02:08:41,110
Big baby!

2985
02:08:43,950 --> 02:08:44,390
Whoa!

2986
02:08:44,730 --> 02:08:45,310
Did I do it?

2987
02:08:45,350 --> 02:08:45,810
Okay, I did.

2988
02:08:45,850 --> 02:08:46,710
I spellbind in time.

2989
02:08:46,830 --> 02:08:47,250
Thank god.

2990
02:08:48,050 --> 02:08:50,450
Oh my god, I don't know, like, her thing.

2991
02:08:51,230 --> 02:08:53,190
Like, oh it's so confusing.

2992
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:55,030
I'm trying to figure out what her...

2993
02:08:56,150 --> 02:08:58,450
Oh, I'm trying to figure out her patterns, but she has so many legs.

2994
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:05,730
It's like really hard to figure out the pattern because of how many legs she has.

2995
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:09,790
It's just a lot of legs!

2996
02:09:10,230 --> 02:09:11,530
Guys, it's everywhere!

2997
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:13,510
Like, it's understandable!

2998
02:09:14,730 --> 02:09:15,490
Legs for days!

2999
02:09:15,970 --> 02:09:18,030
Bro, she has more than... wait, does she have eight?

3000
02:09:18,230 --> 02:09:19,630
Like, I think she has more than eight.

3001
02:09:20,890 --> 02:09:21,690
Oh my

3002
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:26,820
god, that was close.

3003
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,820
That was actually... what the fuck?

3004
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:29,300
That was close.

3005
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:31,520
Too many!

3006
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:33,000
Too many legs!

3007
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:35,940
That's a way to go!

3008
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:39,900
Oh my god.

3009
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:44,940
Holy fuck, bro!

3010
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:48,660
Bro, not in front of him!

3011
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:50,620
That's weird.

3012
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,140
That... what?!

3013
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:57,340
That insta kills me?!

3014
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:58,120
Fuck!

3015
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:02,390
I literally just stood there!

3016
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:08,030
I can't believe that kills me!

3017
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:15,340
Oh my god!

3018
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,460
Okay, that shit was... that was a lot of damage.

3019
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:22,500
That was a lot of damage.

3020
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:24,720
I came from there, okay.

3021
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:31,600
For some context, Bakae knows she's his kid, but heaven forbids mingling with Gwae.

3022
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:34,800
Acknowledging her will probably get her hunted down.

3023
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:36,660
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

3024
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:37,560
Thank you, thank you.

3025
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:38,640
See ya is all out of love.

3026
02:10:40,380 --> 02:10:45,300
Like, he could secretly... like, he might not... hey, maybe they're not watching right now, you know?

3027
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:46,440
Maybe they're...

3028
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:52,960
Maybe... maybe they're not watching right now, you don't know that, you know?

3029
02:10:58,660 --> 02:10:59,640
Oh my god.

3030
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:01,120
Verita!

3031
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:02,600
Thank you for the super chat.

3032
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:03,800
Thank you, thank you.

3033
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:04,500
Jesus.

3034
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,520
Oh my god.

3035
02:11:13,450 --> 02:11:16,030
Jeez, this does so much damage.

3036
02:11:17,470 --> 02:11:19,370
Better watch it, you don't wanna die here.

3037
02:11:19,470 --> 02:11:20,710
But I'm doing this all for you, man.

3038
02:11:21,070 --> 02:11:25,270
And you're... even though you don't... you don't... you don't wanna pay for the child support, but I'm still here.

3039
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:28,370
Did I miss?

3040
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:29,690
I fucking missed.

3041
02:11:29,690 --> 02:11:31,410
God damn it.

3042
02:11:34,990 --> 02:11:36,270
Jesus Christ!

3043
02:11:36,590 --> 02:11:37,510
I can't!

3044
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:38,570
I can't!

3045
02:11:38,570 --> 02:11:39,870
Oh my god, bro!

3046
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:40,450
Okay!

3047
02:11:40,710 --> 02:11:42,450
He's just too many legs.

3048
02:11:42,710 --> 02:11:46,150
Like, I'm actually losing track of how to fight this.

3049
02:11:48,930 --> 02:11:50,230
I'm losing track.

3050
02:11:50,410 --> 02:11:51,790
There's just way too many legs.

3051
02:11:51,970 --> 02:11:54,450
Like, it's actually disorienting me.

3052
02:11:59,610 --> 02:12:00,250
No!

3053
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:00,890
No!

3054
02:12:01,410 --> 02:12:02,050
Please!

3055
02:12:03,310 --> 02:12:03,950
No!

3056
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:06,730
Flicko and me not in front of him!

3057
02:12:07,770 --> 02:12:10,350
Not only on Wednesdays!

3058
02:12:12,430 --> 02:12:15,130
Oh my god, please, I can't even heal.

3059
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:18,210
I can't even heal, man.

3060
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:20,470
I can't even heal.

3061
02:12:21,090 --> 02:12:23,030
Oh my god!

3062
02:12:23,470 --> 02:12:24,110
Bro!

3063
02:12:24,110 --> 02:12:25,050
Bro, please!

3064
02:12:27,130 --> 02:12:29,530
I can't get out of here!

3065
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:37,410
Oh my god, I know I should saspin, but like, I... guys, like...

3066
02:12:38,110 --> 02:12:40,590
Oh god, oh, she's gonna explode.

3067
02:12:40,930 --> 02:12:42,070
Oh shit!

3068
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:51,270
This is so crazy.

3069
02:12:52,050 --> 02:12:54,170
He's so... Oh my god!

3070
02:12:54,390 --> 02:12:55,190
The spider!

3071
02:12:55,650 --> 02:12:58,090
I don't... I don't... I'm gonna get the freeze.

3072
02:12:58,550 --> 02:13:00,650
No, Raijin, I'm getting the freeze.

3073
02:13:00,730 --> 02:13:01,290
No, fuck this.

3074
02:13:01,330 --> 02:13:02,030
I'm using magic.

3075
02:13:02,270 --> 02:13:03,570
Oh, no!

3076
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:04,530
Okay.

3077
02:13:04,790 --> 02:13:06,010
I'm using magic.

3078
02:13:06,010 --> 02:13:07,670
I'm res... I'm swapping.

3079
02:13:07,930 --> 02:13:09,130
I can't.

3080
02:13:09,130 --> 02:13:10,870
I can't get close to her.

3081
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:13,470
Okay.

3082
02:13:14,910 --> 02:13:17,490
I could barely get close to her, guys.

3083
02:13:17,690 --> 02:13:19,690
Like, I need to use this.

3084
02:13:19,950 --> 02:13:20,410
Okay.

3085
02:13:22,230 --> 02:13:22,670
Alright.

3086
02:13:24,050 --> 02:13:26,930
Okay, I need to get rid of one.

3087
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:28,370
Can I just get rid of one?

3088
02:13:29,010 --> 02:13:29,710
Okay, reclaim.

3089
02:13:29,830 --> 02:13:30,150
Nice.

3090
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:32,370
Okay, I'll get rid of...

3091
02:13:32,910 --> 02:13:34,670
I wanna get rid of...

3092
02:13:35,270 --> 02:13:37,630
I'll get rid of... What did I...

3093
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:45,810
I'll get... Oh, actually, I'll get rid of... this.

3094
02:13:46,030 --> 02:13:47,770
And then I'll put that in here.

3095
02:13:49,230 --> 02:13:49,670
Okay.

3096
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:50,750
Alright.

3097
02:13:51,790 --> 02:13:53,330
And then I'll swap it.

3098
02:13:53,410 --> 02:13:53,890
I can't.

3099
02:13:53,890 --> 02:13:54,610
We need the freeze.

3100
02:13:54,670 --> 02:13:55,790
It was too much.

3101
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:57,550
Too much.

3102
02:13:57,650 --> 02:13:58,170
Okay.

3103
02:13:58,830 --> 02:13:59,790
Set spells.

3104
02:14:02,710 --> 02:14:03,250
Immobilize.

3105
02:14:04,010 --> 02:14:05,330
And then we'll use magic.

3106
02:14:07,610 --> 02:14:08,490
Alright, here we go.

3107
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:13,830
She's like that in the bedroom.

3108
02:14:14,010 --> 02:14:16,410
I can see how he went a little...

3109
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:22,930
Oh, I haven't started it.

3110
02:14:23,010 --> 02:14:23,790
Oh, thank God.

3111
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:24,530
I haven't.

3112
02:14:24,530 --> 02:14:26,490
Oh, I haven't started it.

3113
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:30,590
It's okay.

3114
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:31,970
She didn't see me.

3115
02:14:32,090 --> 02:14:33,930
She didn't see me.

3116
02:14:35,410 --> 02:14:36,250
It's okay.

3117
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:39,330
Bro, why did you leave?

3118
02:14:39,410 --> 02:14:40,110
Bro, bro.

3119
02:14:42,690 --> 02:14:44,550
She didn't see me, guys.

3120
02:14:44,790 --> 02:14:46,350
She didn't see me.

3121
02:14:49,550 --> 02:14:50,550
There we go.

3122
02:14:50,590 --> 02:14:53,190
Now we start it.

3123
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:56,130
Thank God.

3124
02:14:56,910 --> 02:14:58,710
Thank God she didn't see me, guys.

3125
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:04,620
Okay, nice.

3126
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:06,740
Okay.

3127
02:15:08,380 --> 02:15:09,080
Nice, alright.

3128
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:11,040
We're off to a good start, guys.

3129
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:12,300
We're off to a good start.

3130
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:17,250
Okay, nice.

3131
02:15:18,430 --> 02:15:21,210
Guys, it's just... I don't know.

3132
02:15:21,810 --> 02:15:23,290
It's just too much movement.

3133
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:27,550
I'm seeing too much movement, so it disorients me so much.

3134
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:33,410
It's just something about all these lings is distracting me.

3135
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:34,850
Don't lie to me.

3136
02:15:35,090 --> 02:15:36,370
This is what happened to you two.

3137
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:40,070
Like, look at all these kids she has.

3138
02:15:40,130 --> 02:15:40,610
You know.

3139
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:44,730
Okay, nice.

3140
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:46,190
Okay.

3141
02:15:46,190 --> 02:15:46,270
Okay.

3142
02:15:46,570 --> 02:15:48,950
After I get this down, I can get the babies in.

3143
02:15:50,550 --> 02:15:51,370
And then...

3144
02:15:51,370 --> 02:15:51,810
Oh, no.

3145
02:15:52,110 --> 02:15:52,550
Please.

3146
02:15:52,910 --> 02:15:53,350
No!

3147
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:56,640
Fuck you!

3148
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:57,100
Fuck.

3149
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:57,320
Okay.

3150
02:15:57,420 --> 02:15:58,600
I missed again, guys.

3151
02:15:58,700 --> 02:15:59,000
Okay.

3152
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:01,020
It's alright.

3153
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:01,900
Monk, babe.

3154
02:16:02,020 --> 02:16:02,880
Monkeys, go in.

3155
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:06,320
Monkeys, go in and do your thing while I figure this out.

3156
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:07,860
Go do your thing, monkeys.

3157
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:09,920
Yes, hit her.

3158
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,260
Oh, God, please.

3159
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:14,700
Just do your thing while I figure this out, monkeys.

3160
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:15,740
I don't...

3161
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:16,880
Why is she still on me?

3162
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:17,740
Why is she...

3163
02:16:17,740 --> 02:16:19,520
Why is she still on...

3164
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:21,560
Monkeys, I thought you're supposed to do your thing.

3165
02:16:22,120 --> 02:16:22,720
But...

3166
02:16:25,780 --> 02:16:28,160
Why is she still on me, monkeys?

3167
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:33,040
You're supposed to do your thing.

3168
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:37,320
Oh, my God.

3169
02:16:39,820 --> 02:16:40,120
Oh.

3170
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:41,520
Oh, man.

3171
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:45,020
She's so fucking scary.

3172
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:46,560
What?

3173
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:47,120
What?!

3174
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:49,680
Oh god!

3175
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:50,340
Oh god!

3176
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:51,700
Oh god!

3177
02:16:53,460 --> 02:16:54,160
Oh god!

3178
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:55,340
No, I dodged it!

3179
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:55,800
Thank god!

3180
02:16:55,940 --> 02:16:56,880
Okay, I dodged it.

3181
02:16:56,940 --> 02:16:57,340
That's good.

3182
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:57,720
That's good.

3183
02:16:57,760 --> 02:16:58,400
I dodged it.

3184
02:16:58,680 --> 02:16:59,680
That shit is scary.

3185
02:17:00,180 --> 02:17:01,500
That shit is actually scary.

3186
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:03,480
What?!

3187
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:05,620
What is that?!

3188
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:08,540
What the fuck is that?!

3189
02:17:11,250 --> 02:17:12,670
What did she do?!

3190
02:17:12,670 --> 02:17:13,230
Oh!

3191
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:16,050
Why?!

3192
02:17:18,310 --> 02:17:20,730
What the fuck do I do here?!

3193
02:17:20,730 --> 02:17:22,310
What is that?!

3194
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:25,110
What is this?!

3195
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:26,270
What is this?!

3196
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:29,310
Why does this get me out of here?!

3197
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:31,970
Oh my god.

3198
02:17:32,390 --> 02:17:33,970
How do I get out?

3199
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:41,990
Oh my god, how was I supposed to know I was gonna get trapped in a web?!

3200
02:17:44,090 --> 02:17:44,690
No.

3201
02:17:45,410 --> 02:17:46,830
Oh no, please.

3202
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:49,190
Jesus.

3203
02:17:49,590 --> 02:17:52,570
She's so... she is so difficult.

3204
02:17:52,790 --> 02:17:53,550
She is.

3205
02:17:54,490 --> 02:17:55,830
Come on, get over here.

3206
02:17:57,650 --> 02:17:58,950
I'm just gonna use this.

3207
02:17:59,130 --> 02:17:59,510
I'm just...

3208
02:17:59,510 --> 02:18:03,110
Okay, now that I know that does that, I'm definitely...

3209
02:18:03,650 --> 02:18:04,330
Oh, nice.

3210
02:18:05,370 --> 02:18:05,890
Okay.

3211
02:18:07,350 --> 02:18:08,250
Oh, I'm halfway.

3212
02:18:08,390 --> 02:18:08,790
Come on!

3213
02:18:08,970 --> 02:18:09,650
You're so good!

3214
02:18:10,450 --> 02:18:10,970
Okay.

3215
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:12,750
No!

3216
02:18:13,130 --> 02:18:13,650
No!

3217
02:18:13,850 --> 02:18:14,810
Get me out!

3218
02:18:15,110 --> 02:18:16,690
She missed, I think!

3219
02:18:18,490 --> 02:18:19,010
No!

3220
02:18:20,990 --> 02:18:21,510
No!

3221
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:23,190
No, I wanted to heal!

3222
02:18:25,330 --> 02:18:26,090
Get out.

3223
02:18:26,970 --> 02:18:28,450
Oh, get me out of here.

3224
02:18:28,690 --> 02:18:31,630
I had to use that because I got scared.

3225
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:33,970
I got scared.

3226
02:18:35,730 --> 02:18:37,390
Oh my god, I...

3227
02:18:38,710 --> 02:18:39,730
I forgot to heal.

3228
02:18:39,890 --> 02:18:41,690
Oh my god, I also wanted to heal instead.

3229
02:18:44,090 --> 02:18:44,610
Oh!

3230
02:18:50,970 --> 02:18:52,190
Oh my god!

3231
02:18:56,440 --> 02:18:58,100
Oh my god!

3232
02:18:58,240 --> 02:18:58,660
Oh my god!

3233
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:02,800
Oh my god!

3234
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:04,340
So low!

3235
02:19:09,890 --> 02:19:11,430
I missed it!

3236
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:12,610
I missed it!

3237
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:13,570
I missed it!

3238
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:13,830
I missed it!

3239
02:19:14,730 --> 02:19:17,230
Oh, I'm sorry about your wife, bro.

3240
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:19,530
She was crazy.

3241
02:19:25,910 --> 02:19:28,010
She has a relic?

3242
02:19:28,230 --> 02:19:29,150
What does she have?

3243
02:19:29,970 --> 02:19:30,010
She has a relic?

3244
02:19:30,010 --> 02:19:30,010
What does she have?

3245
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:33,090
Even I would go...

3246
02:19:33,090 --> 02:19:34,250
What the...

3247
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:35,570
Oh my god!

3248
02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:38,710
How many kids?

3249
02:19:39,330 --> 02:19:41,150
I thought you had one!

3250
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:47,130
I thought you had one!

3251
02:19:47,130 --> 02:19:47,970
This is not one!

3252
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:48,930
This is not one!

3253
02:19:48,930 --> 02:19:50,390
This is not one!

3254
02:19:51,170 --> 02:19:51,650
This was not one!

3255
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:55,010
Oh, this is absolutely not one!

3256
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:56,690
This is not...

3257
02:19:56,690 --> 02:19:59,050
This is not one!

3258
02:19:59,630 --> 02:20:01,050
How many rounds?

3259
02:20:01,510 --> 02:20:03,290
How many rounds?

3260
02:20:04,390 --> 02:20:05,690
How many rounds?

3261
02:20:05,690 --> 02:20:06,750
Run, Forrest, run!

3262
02:20:07,610 --> 02:20:09,370
Oh my god!

3263
02:20:09,630 --> 02:20:12,050
Oh, I'm running as fast as I can!

3264
02:20:12,550 --> 02:20:14,470
I'm running so fast!

3265
02:20:14,850 --> 02:20:15,590
First floor!

3266
02:20:16,010 --> 02:20:17,310
Oh my god!

3267
02:20:17,310 --> 02:20:19,510
That man had stamina for days!

3268
02:20:22,250 --> 02:20:24,030
He can't pay...

3269
02:20:24,030 --> 02:20:25,710
I understand now.

3270
02:20:25,810 --> 02:20:28,510
I understand why he couldn't pay for all the child support.

3271
02:20:28,830 --> 02:20:30,890
I understand now why he couldn't pay for all the child support.

3272
02:20:30,890 --> 02:20:31,810
I understand now why he refused to acknowledge them.

3273
02:20:32,370 --> 02:20:33,870
I understand now why he refused to acknowledge them.

3274
02:20:33,870 --> 02:20:35,170
They got pretty busy.

3275
02:20:47,820 --> 02:20:49,260
Oh, it's her!

3276
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:50,720
It's the goth lady.

3277
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:52,980
The goth lady was so mad.

3278
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:53,920
I don't have any polygons.

3279
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:55,640
Hello.

3280
02:20:57,900 --> 02:20:58,900
I got saved.

3281
02:21:01,060 --> 02:21:02,500
Temple of yellow flowers.

3282
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:04,980
Hi, thank you for the super chat.

3283
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:05,920
Thank you, thank you.

3284
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:09,060
Where's the flamethrower spell when you need it?

3285
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:10,740
Bro, that wasn't one.

3286
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:12,260
Bro, that wasn't one.

3287
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:14,200
I thought it was one child.

3288
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:18,140
When she was like, Grab your sisters!

3289
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:23,480
I thought it'd be like, you know, 15 at like, at most.

3290
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:25,100
That was not 15.

3291
02:21:25,380 --> 02:21:27,460
Oh my god.

3292
02:21:29,020 --> 02:21:30,440
He really got busy.

3293
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:34,300
Okay, nice.

3294
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:37,160
We finally got the gold thread so we can put this on.

3295
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:41,980
It turned out he had a lot of child support to pay.

3296
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:43,480
A lot.

3297
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:46,800
Okay, not that.

3298
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:48,360
Oh, is this?

3299
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:49,720
80?

3300
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:53,860
Let's...

3301
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:57,720
After seeing through the enemy?

3302
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:03,200
I feel like my...

3303
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:08,320
Can you just stay focused for a brief moment after seeing through the enemy?

3304
02:22:08,980 --> 02:22:09,340
Wait.

3305
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:10,820
I feel like the...

3306
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:13,420
Does my staff is...

3307
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:16,600
Isn't my staff better?

3308
02:22:17,460 --> 02:22:18,540
Isn't this better?

3309
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,560
Yeah, this is better.

3310
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:21,140
Oh!

3311
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:22,640
Hey, upgrade!

3312
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:24,700
Alright, let's get that.

3313
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:31,560
Yeah, this is better.

3314
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:31,920
Yeah, this is better.

3315
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:36,560
Alright.

3316
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:37,540
Nice.

3317
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:40,340
Now we're okay again.

3318
02:22:43,300 --> 02:22:43,920
Alright.

3319
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:46,980
And we got a fragment Vaan!

3320
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:49,520
Alright.

3321
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:52,880
Now we talk to pretty lady.

3322
02:22:54,860 --> 02:22:56,260
Hello, pretty lady.

3323
02:22:56,600 --> 02:22:58,900
You saved us from your crazy mom.

3324
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:00,360
You saved us from your crazy mom.

3325
02:23:00,940 --> 02:23:02,000
Well, you're not a lady.

3326
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:02,600
Oh!

3327
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:03,960
Okay.

3328
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:05,840
Okay.

3329
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:09,940
He's not a good guy too.

3330
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:14,740
I just looked at him because I was like, What?

3331
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:20,700
Okay.

3332
02:23:22,820 --> 02:23:23,660
Who are you?

3333
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:24,520
I was like, who are you?

3334
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:28,240
Yeah.

3335
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,100
I was like, who are you?

3336
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:33,020
I don't remember you.

3337
02:23:33,740 --> 02:23:35,280
No, but thank you for the magenta soup.

3338
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:36,200
Thank you.

3339
02:23:36,220 --> 02:23:36,840
Thank you.

3340
02:23:37,980 --> 02:23:39,140
Hi, Doki.

3341
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:40,660
I just got a good turn of fortune.

3342
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:44,220
And since I don't have to pay spider child support, I thought I'd send some your way.

3343
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:44,760
Thank you.

3344
02:23:44,780 --> 02:23:45,660
Thank you for the magenta soup.

3345
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:46,560
Thank you.

3346
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:46,880
Thank you.

3347
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,180
Am I the child support?

3348
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:53,760
I'm the child support experience.

3349
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:56,640
Thank you for the magenta soup.

3350
02:23:56,640 --> 02:23:57,380
Thank you.

3351
02:23:57,400 --> 02:23:57,980
Thank you.

3352
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:01,620
I'm glad you got some good fortune your way.

3353
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,540
All right.

3354
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:04,960
Nice.

3355
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:07,920
These guys are weak because they're people.

3356
02:24:09,580 --> 02:24:10,180
These guys are weak because they're people.

3357
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:14,040
You guys are so weak.

3358
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:15,180
Look at you.

3359
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:15,800
You're people.

3360
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:18,100
Look at your fleshy bodies.

3361
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,900
Fly whisk Dallas.

3362
02:24:22,460 --> 02:24:22,560
Fly whisk Dallas.

3363
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:24,540
Yeah.

3364
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:26,620
He's too fleshy.

3365
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:29,160
He's not a threat.

3366
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:32,740
All right.

3367
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:34,200
Get him out of the way.

3368
02:24:35,380 --> 02:24:35,900
Whoa.

3369
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:36,860
What the fuck?

3370
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:39,960
You barely do any damage, bro.

3371
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:40,660
You barely do any damage, bro.

3372
02:24:40,660 --> 02:24:41,280
It's so sad.

3373
02:24:43,700 --> 02:24:44,460
Oh, shit.

3374
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:44,680
Hey.

3375
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:46,320
I'm going to steal your stuff too.

3376
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:49,980
Nice.

3377
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:52,380
I stole his stuff.

3378
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:53,200
It's mine now.

3379
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:56,200
Oh my god.

3380
02:24:56,220 --> 02:24:56,620
Which way do I go?

3381
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:57,320
Oh, wait.

3382
02:24:58,420 --> 02:24:58,860
Yeah.

3383
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:00,380
He's still also... He's still weak too.

3384
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:01,740
So I don't have to worry.

3385
02:25:02,220 --> 02:25:04,240
I like how his buddy is just watching.

3386
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:06,440
He's just like...

3387
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:07,140
All right.

3388
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:10,420
Let's wait for him to get beat up before I go in.

3389
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:13,000
All right.

3390
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:13,260
Nice.

3391
02:25:13,340 --> 02:25:13,720
Absorb.

3392
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:16,440
Oh, hey.

3393
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:17,900
This guy's not flesh.

3394
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:19,500
I mean, technically.

3395
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:20,740
Oh, he's just...

3396
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:21,260
What is he?

3397
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:23,460
What the fuck is... Whoa!

3398
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:25,060
What are you...

3399
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:25,540
Whoa!

3400
02:25:25,700 --> 02:25:26,740
What the fuck?

3401
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:28,480
Oh my god.

3402
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:31,220
From fleshy human to whatever this guy was.

3403
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:33,420
What a fucking jump skill.

3404
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:35,440
Oh my god.

3405
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:39,340
The skill gap between these two is actually crazy.

3406
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:41,100
Oh, please you.

3407
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:42,340
Please you.

3408
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:44,820
I'm going to bring the baby.

3409
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:45,500
I'm bringing the baby.

3410
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:46,740
Okay.

3411
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:47,340
That's not...

3412
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:47,920
Okay.

3413
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:49,280
Oh, the baby did it.

3414
02:25:49,380 --> 02:25:49,560
Yay.

3415
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:53,300
That's not what I wanted, but it worked.

3416
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:54,120
It worked.

3417
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:54,780
Thank god.

3418
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:56,860
Thank god it worked.

3419
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:00,220
Wait, but why?

3420
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:01,220
What was he guarding?

3421
02:26:01,460 --> 02:26:02,240
Oh, he was guarding this.

3422
02:26:05,300 --> 02:26:06,260
Thank you, baby.

3423
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:09,380
Wait, but there's something over here.

3424
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:11,360
I think it can go up, right?

3425
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:13,140
Let me double check.

3426
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:17,710
I thought I could.

3427
02:26:18,730 --> 02:26:19,430
Can I?

3428
02:26:21,030 --> 02:26:21,490
No.

3429
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:22,750
It was just one way.

3430
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:23,710
Nice.

3431
02:26:26,750 --> 02:26:29,530
Yeah, that snake compared to the fleshy human.

3432
02:26:30,070 --> 02:26:30,670
Jeez.

3433
02:26:31,730 --> 02:26:32,750
The damage.

3434
02:26:35,190 --> 02:26:35,790
Alright.

3435
02:26:36,070 --> 02:26:37,190
Up we go.

3436
02:26:37,470 --> 02:26:39,190
Up the mountain we go.

3437
02:26:42,610 --> 02:26:43,210
What?

3438
02:26:43,210 --> 02:26:44,310
There's another human.

3439
02:26:44,610 --> 02:26:46,050
Look at him just walk down the stairs.

3440
02:26:46,350 --> 02:26:48,010
It's so sad.

3441
02:26:48,410 --> 02:26:49,530
I mean...

3442
02:26:51,190 --> 02:26:55,710
After fighting so many quads, just seeing these people.

3443
02:26:56,650 --> 02:26:57,750
What the fuck?

3444
02:26:57,770 --> 02:26:58,850
That's a tiger snake.

3445
02:26:58,970 --> 02:27:01,250
A tiger and a snake fucked and made that.

3446
02:27:01,790 --> 02:27:02,830
Holy shit.

3447
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:03,670
What a freak.

3448
02:27:04,170 --> 02:27:05,130
You're a freak.

3449
02:27:07,070 --> 02:27:08,190
Oh my god.

3450
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:08,950
Look at you.

3451
02:27:09,630 --> 02:27:10,810
Oh, I'm sorry.

3452
02:27:10,970 --> 02:27:11,590
I'm so sorry.

3453
02:27:11,730 --> 02:27:12,570
I did not mean that.

3454
02:27:12,670 --> 02:27:13,890
I meant that.

3455
02:27:17,030 --> 02:27:18,490
Look at you.

3456
02:27:18,490 --> 02:27:18,630
Look at you.

3457
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:22,610
Which one's the mom and which one's the dad?

3458
02:27:24,030 --> 02:27:25,750
I have so many questions.

3459
02:27:26,990 --> 02:27:29,750
I feel like the mom had to be the tiger.

3460
02:27:29,870 --> 02:27:30,390
There's no way.

3461
02:27:31,350 --> 02:27:33,150
It's like some Kung Fu Panda shit.

3462
02:27:34,270 --> 02:27:35,390
Oh my god.

3463
02:27:35,430 --> 02:27:36,290
I'm so sorry.

3464
02:27:39,930 --> 02:27:40,450
Jesus.

3465
02:27:40,450 --> 02:27:42,410
He kept locking me in the corner.

3466
02:27:43,150 --> 02:27:44,070
I'm sorry.

3467
02:27:44,990 --> 02:27:46,670
Sorry for calling you a freak.

3468
02:27:48,430 --> 02:27:49,210
Oh my god.

3469
02:27:49,230 --> 02:27:49,590
Look at him.

3470
02:27:49,610 --> 02:27:51,310
He has like a snake tongue too.

3471
02:27:52,390 --> 02:27:52,830
Nice.

3472
02:27:53,390 --> 02:27:54,270
The throw.

3473
02:27:54,370 --> 02:27:56,230
The throw he threw at me.

3474
02:27:56,690 --> 02:27:57,570
That's insane.

3475
02:27:58,130 --> 02:27:59,590
The snake sheriff.

3476
02:28:01,550 --> 02:28:02,890
A head so large.

3477
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:04,090
A tail so thin.

3478
02:28:04,250 --> 02:28:05,210
Seven foot long.

3479
02:28:05,710 --> 02:28:06,990
With tiger stripes.

3480
02:28:07,130 --> 02:28:09,730
Does it say how there was a tiger with a strong desire for the dad?

3481
02:28:09,870 --> 02:28:12,050
Oh, it tells how his dad met his mom.

3482
02:28:13,170 --> 02:28:16,650
At first, the warrior mastered a stainer for being a mere tiger.

3483
02:28:16,670 --> 02:28:21,010
Unlike his other disciple and refused to see him.

3484
02:28:21,170 --> 02:28:21,990
Oh my god.

3485
02:28:22,090 --> 02:28:24,490
He hates his master hated tigers.

3486
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:28,650
What does it say where he bangs the snake?

3487
02:28:28,890 --> 02:28:30,090
The tiger...

3488
02:28:30,090 --> 02:28:30,210
Oh!

3489
02:28:32,370 --> 02:28:33,250
Oh!

3490
02:28:36,630 --> 02:28:38,930
He became a snake!

3491
02:28:39,690 --> 02:28:41,730
Through Taoist practice!

3492
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:50,060
After some time he could no longer speak.

3493
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:58,300
Oh, because he trained so hard that he became a snake tiger.

3494
02:28:59,300 --> 02:29:00,020
Yeah.

3495
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:01,160
He got cursed.

3496
02:29:06,890 --> 02:29:10,070
He got cursed into becoming the freak he is.

3497
02:29:11,170 --> 02:29:12,410
That's sadder.

3498
02:29:12,470 --> 02:29:13,650
That's sadder than...

3499
02:29:13,650 --> 02:29:15,190
Wait, was this the right way?

3500
02:29:15,790 --> 02:29:22,550
Because he wasn't because of an illegal affair between a snake and a tiger.

3501
02:29:23,150 --> 02:29:24,910
He just got cursed to be like that.

3502
02:29:27,010 --> 02:29:28,270
He got cursed.

3503
02:29:28,810 --> 02:29:31,430
Because his master doesn't want to train a tiger.

3504
02:29:31,910 --> 02:29:33,230
Why wouldn't you?

3505
02:29:33,510 --> 02:29:34,630
That's so cool!

3506
02:29:35,150 --> 02:29:38,030
That fucking tiger was like I wanna be like...

3507
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:39,910
I wanna be like these...

3508
02:29:39,910 --> 02:29:42,030
Like these guys are so weak too!

3509
02:29:43,130 --> 02:29:46,430
Like the master trained like weak ass fucking...

3510
02:29:47,150 --> 02:29:48,650
fucking soul Taoist people.

3511
02:29:49,350 --> 02:29:50,570
Like look at them!

3512
02:29:50,570 --> 02:29:51,750
They're so weak!

3513
02:29:52,830 --> 02:29:54,630
I don't wanna train a tiger!

3514
02:29:56,390 --> 02:29:57,110
Alright.

3515
02:30:01,290 --> 02:30:02,370
Up we go.

3516
02:30:03,110 --> 02:30:05,170
He wasn't a cat person.

3517
02:30:05,690 --> 02:30:07,650
He made some weak ass soldiers.

3518
02:30:07,750 --> 02:30:08,530
That's for sure.

3519
02:30:11,910 --> 02:30:13,770
These are like flesh bodies.

3520
02:30:15,250 --> 02:30:17,830
I can kill this guy in five seconds.

3521
02:30:17,910 --> 02:30:18,470
Watch this.

3522
02:30:19,790 --> 02:30:21,230
One, two...

3523
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:22,810
Sorry.

3524
02:30:22,890 --> 02:30:23,350
Count stop.

3525
02:30:23,490 --> 02:30:24,870
Two, three, four...

3526
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:25,370
Okay, there you go.

3527
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:25,570
See?

3528
02:30:25,610 --> 02:30:26,190
Less than five.

3529
02:30:27,290 --> 02:30:30,010
The count only starts when I start hitting.

3530
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:36,190
When they hit back, we stop the count.

3531
02:30:38,390 --> 02:30:40,210
Why are you so weak?

3532
02:30:42,490 --> 02:30:43,010
Okay.

3533
02:30:43,110 --> 02:30:44,430
Grab some...

3534
02:30:44,430 --> 02:30:46,870
Let me stop.

3535
02:30:47,070 --> 02:30:50,570
How many tigers wanted to be religious?

3536
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:51,630
How many tigers wanted to be religious?

3537
02:30:52,130 --> 02:30:53,390
It's like...

3538
02:30:54,430 --> 02:30:55,890
Because there's so many!

3539
02:30:58,150 --> 02:31:00,230
How many did you curse?

3540
02:31:00,710 --> 02:31:01,410
Like...

3541
02:31:01,410 --> 02:31:02,750
I don't understand.

3542
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:09,890
I thought it was just one.

3543
02:31:09,970 --> 02:31:12,270
But apparently there's two at least.

3544
02:31:12,470 --> 02:31:14,250
He ate it so...

3545
02:31:14,250 --> 02:31:14,890
Like...

3546
02:31:14,890 --> 02:31:18,010
That wasn't even the first tiger he cursed?

3547
02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:21,150
He just didn't like tigers.

3548
02:31:21,390 --> 02:31:22,110
He just didn't like tigers.

3549
02:31:22,130 --> 02:31:24,130
How did he curse more than one tiger?

3550
02:31:27,450 --> 02:31:28,010
Wait.

3551
02:31:31,150 --> 02:31:32,910
Did he curse this guy too?

3552
02:31:34,010 --> 02:31:35,650
Did he make them worms?

3553
02:31:35,690 --> 02:31:36,450
And was like...

3554
02:31:36,450 --> 02:31:38,310
Would you love me if I stole a worm?

3555
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:40,970
He's a tiger hater.

3556
02:31:42,710 --> 02:31:43,270
What

3557
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:55,120
the fuck?

3558
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:56,240
He cursed him too?

3559
02:31:59,360 --> 02:31:59,920
He...

3560
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:02,080
He made him into worms!

3561
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:03,720
He...

3562
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:06,160
Not only did he curse regular tigers...

3563
02:32:06,820 --> 02:32:08,540
He also made people...

3564
02:32:08,540 --> 02:32:09,360
Who is this master?

3565
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:10,720
Am I going to beat the shit out of him?

3566
02:32:11,320 --> 02:32:13,020
Am I going to beat up this master?

3567
02:32:15,020 --> 02:32:16,720
He's a hater.

3568
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:17,920
He just hates everything.

3569
02:32:21,930 --> 02:32:22,950
It's this way.

3570
02:32:23,010 --> 02:32:23,210
Okay.

3571
02:32:24,710 --> 02:32:25,930
You're all cursed.

3572
02:32:27,150 --> 02:32:29,930
But yet they're stronger than the regular guys.

3573
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:30,750
But yet they're stronger than the regular guys.

3574
02:32:33,330 --> 02:32:34,430
Let's go.

3575
02:32:34,430 --> 02:32:36,410
This master has impossible standards.

3576
02:32:36,810 --> 02:32:41,290
Would the town still love me if I was a worm?

3577
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,840
This master has impossible standards.

3578
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:49,860
Would the town still love me if I was a worm?

3579
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:50,320
Oh fuck!

3580
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:51,640
Bro, that's cheap.

3581
02:32:52,100 --> 02:32:54,160
The master didn't teach you that.

3582
02:32:54,300 --> 02:32:55,280
The master doesn't want that.

3583
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:58,240
The master doesn't like cheap shit.

3584
02:33:00,220 --> 02:33:00,840
Yeah.

3585
02:33:01,460 --> 02:33:02,420
Up we go.

3586
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:06,260
What are you doing?

3587
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:06,880
Guarding?

3588
02:33:07,960 --> 02:33:08,920
What are you doing?

3589
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:10,780
Why are you guarding my shrine?

3590
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:12,800
Bro, this is my shrine.

3591
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:15,240
That's right.

3592
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:20,840
My shrine.

3593
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:23,960
Human jumpscare.

3594
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:24,600
A man!

3595
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:30,600
Okay, rest.

3596
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:32,360
Alright.

3597
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:34,180
Oh, do I have new stuff?

3598
02:33:34,860 --> 02:33:35,700
I do!

3599
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:36,780
What do I have?

3600
02:33:39,700 --> 02:33:41,480
Take a sip without- Oh!

3601
02:33:41,980 --> 02:33:42,520
Okay.

3602
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:45,240
Increases damage reduction.

3603
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:47,520
Okay, we'll get that.

3604
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:48,880
I like that more.

3605
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:51,520
Wait, what did I get?

3606
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:54,380
Increases damage reduction.

3607
02:33:54,620 --> 02:33:58,320
Grants a considerable chance to take a sip without consuming gourd.

3608
02:33:58,460 --> 02:33:58,940
Okay, wait.

3609
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:02,580
36% more increases movement speed.

3610
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:05,620
36% of maximum health.

3611
02:34:06,700 --> 02:34:08,280
I like the mana more.

3612
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:12,100
Uh, can I rest?

3613
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:12,640
Yeah, I did.

3614
02:34:14,380 --> 02:34:15,460
Yeah, I did rest.

3615
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:15,800
Okay.

3616
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,080
Oh my god, no!

3617
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,500
An open area!

3618
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:22,160
This is my worst nightmare!

3619
02:34:23,100 --> 02:34:25,000
A non-linear path!

3620
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:28,180
Oh no!

3621
02:34:28,420 --> 02:34:29,720
My worst nightmare!

3622
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:33,680
Alright.

3623
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:35,760
I guess I'll go this way.

3624
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:37,140
Oh, the birds are nice, people.

3625
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:41,740
Is there- No, that doesn't go anywhere.

3626
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:42,480
Oh, it's him!

3627
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:43,500
It's the worm guy!

3628
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:45,360
Oh, okay, goodbye.

3629
02:34:45,740 --> 02:34:47,020
I guess you don't care.

3630
02:34:49,940 --> 02:34:51,460
The real bot- Oh, wait!

3631
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:52,700
You tricked me!

3632
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:56,120
Like, look at them!

3633
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:59,020
They're stronger as worms than regular people!

3634
02:34:59,360 --> 02:35:00,200
Well, they have more HP.

3635
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:01,240
I wouldn't say stronger.

3636
02:35:01,580 --> 02:35:07,220
They have more HP as regular- as worm- as worm men.

3637
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:09,520
Oh, shit!

3638
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:12,360
And they have poison, too!

3639
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:16,940
Nice, alright.

3640
02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:19,100
It's alright if I'm poisoned.

3641
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:22,220
It's okay.

3642
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:25,160
What the fuck?

3643
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:28,860
Okay, this guy- Is this master or whatever?

3644
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:32,140
He really loves poisoning his people.

3645
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:34,620
And turning them into worms.

3646
02:35:35,180 --> 02:35:38,420
And turning them into worms.

3647
02:35:38,420 --> 02:35:39,500
The worm men.

3648
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:39,860
The worm men.

3649
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:45,600
Would you love your disciples if they were worms, guys?

3650
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:50,100
Alright, nice.

3651
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:50,420
Whoa!

3652
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:53,480
Oh my god, please don't tell me I'm gonna fall!

3653
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:53,960
Please!

3654
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:56,100
Oh my god, no!

3655
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:58,240
Not the regular humans!

3656
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:05,320
I- I died to the flesh bags!

3657
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:11,440
I have never died to humans!

3658
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:18,640
Oh no, I can't believe I died to the regular humans!

3659
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:23,440
My reputation is gone!

3660
02:36:30,350 --> 02:36:33,690
Okay, it'll never happen again.

3661
02:36:33,710 --> 02:36:34,730
I learned my lesson.

3662
02:36:35,710 --> 02:36:37,430
It'll never happen again.

3663
02:36:38,790 --> 02:36:40,350
Okay, I'll freeze this guy.

3664
02:36:40,590 --> 02:36:41,150
Freeze.

3665
02:36:43,850 --> 02:36:45,910
These guys are so annoying, though.

3666
02:36:46,070 --> 02:36:47,170
I need to get rid of him.

3667
02:36:47,310 --> 02:36:49,790
Because of their poison shit.

3668
02:36:50,390 --> 02:36:51,410
Oh, it's a meditation!

3669
02:36:57,100 --> 02:36:59,240
I don't understand why he hates tigers.

3670
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:06,000
I mean, if my disciple is a fucking tiger, like, why would you say no?

3671
02:37:06,380 --> 02:37:07,940
Like, it's a fucking tiger.

3672
02:37:08,180 --> 02:37:08,680
Come on!

3673
02:37:09,800 --> 02:37:12,260
Do you know how strong fucking tigers are?

3674
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:14,300
A tiger is like ten men.

3675
02:37:14,580 --> 02:37:16,060
Like, why did he curse him?

3676
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:24,180
He's so cool!

3677
02:37:24,420 --> 02:37:24,820
Exactly!

3678
02:37:25,140 --> 02:37:26,280
Imagine seeing a tiger!

3679
02:37:26,780 --> 02:37:28,540
Like, it's like Kung Fu Panda!

3680
02:37:28,860 --> 02:37:31,120
Has this master not watched Kung Fu Panda?

3681
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:35,860
Like, has he not watched Kung Fu Panda?

3682
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:36,840
I can't believe it!

3683
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:37,840
Does he not know?

3684
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:43,180
Alright, let's see.

3685
02:37:43,540 --> 02:37:44,720
We're gonna...

3686
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:47,820
The master hates Kung Fu Panda.

3687
02:37:50,260 --> 02:37:52,300
Oh yeah, I wanted a critical hit.

3688
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:56,820
Uh, I'll go this way.

3689
02:38:02,870 --> 02:38:04,070
Okay, he'll never happen again.

3690
02:38:05,750 --> 02:38:08,550
I told you, never again I learned my lesson.

3691
02:38:10,110 --> 02:38:12,070
Guys, don't you know Kung Fu Panda?

3692
02:38:12,850 --> 02:38:20,850
Kung Fu Panda was based off a book that was released at the same time as Journey to the West.

3693
02:38:21,230 --> 02:38:23,130
It was also called Kung Fu Panda.

3694
02:38:26,170 --> 02:38:29,770
You think people would just spread misinformation like that on the internet?

3695
02:38:31,070 --> 02:38:31,670
Yeah!

3696
02:38:31,950 --> 02:38:36,670
It was based off a book that was written around the same time Journey to the West was written.

3697
02:38:38,410 --> 02:38:40,330
No, it was actually Journey to the...

3698
02:38:40,330 --> 02:38:48,070
Journey to the West was based off of the ye olde Kung Fu Panda book.

3699
02:38:53,150 --> 02:38:56,030
I'm sure that is Kung Fu true.

3700
02:38:56,410 --> 02:38:57,330
What is that?

3701
02:38:57,350 --> 02:38:58,490
Hey guys.

3702
02:39:01,010 --> 02:39:01,530
Oh!

3703
02:39:02,450 --> 02:39:03,270
Oh, okay.

3704
02:39:03,330 --> 02:39:03,570
Sorry.

3705
02:39:03,670 --> 02:39:05,390
I just wanted to... Oh, sorry.

3706
02:39:07,070 --> 02:39:08,150
Maybe I should...

3707
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:09,510
I have reinforcements too.

3708
02:39:10,190 --> 02:39:11,370
Meet my disciples.

3709
02:39:12,910 --> 02:39:13,910
That's fucking right.

3710
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:15,110
That's right.

3711
02:39:15,150 --> 02:39:17,250
I also have disciples too, guys.

3712
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:18,390
That's fucking right.

3713
02:39:20,390 --> 02:39:21,130
That's right!

3714
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:22,490
Oh shit!

3715
02:39:22,710 --> 02:39:23,390
Oh, okay.

3716
02:39:26,090 --> 02:39:28,310
Yeah, I got me some disciples too.

3717
02:39:29,770 --> 02:39:30,070
Not just...

3718
02:39:30,910 --> 02:39:32,650
Not just you and my...

3719
02:39:34,090 --> 02:39:37,850
If they were tigers, I'd let them be a disciple as well.

3720
02:39:38,530 --> 02:39:40,930
Go home, monkey army.

3721
02:39:44,670 --> 02:39:46,430
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3722
02:39:46,670 --> 02:39:48,430
I took so much damage there.

3723
02:39:48,630 --> 02:39:49,150
Alright.

3724
02:39:50,770 --> 02:39:52,170
Yellow dragon time.

3725
02:39:52,250 --> 02:39:53,230
What the fuck?

3726
02:39:53,310 --> 02:39:54,850
Okay, still yellow dragon time.

3727
02:39:55,090 --> 02:39:55,650
Still okay.

3728
02:39:55,790 --> 02:39:56,790
Still yellow... Okay.

3729
02:39:56,790 --> 02:39:58,230
Okay, still yellow dragon time.

3730
02:39:58,350 --> 02:39:58,650
Like...

3731
02:39:59,750 --> 02:40:00,910
It's never stopped.

3732
02:40:01,530 --> 02:40:03,810
It's never stopped yellow dragon time.

3733
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:06,190
Wait.

3734
02:40:06,310 --> 02:40:07,090
Why am I here?

3735
02:40:08,910 --> 02:40:10,330
Wait, he can carry?

3736
02:40:11,030 --> 02:40:11,970
That's legal.

3737
02:40:12,150 --> 02:40:13,530
You're not even real.

3738
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:15,310
Guys, oh no.

3739
02:40:15,910 --> 02:40:16,750
Oh no.

3740
02:40:16,910 --> 02:40:18,710
Wait, where did he come from?

3741
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:20,650
Wait, why am I slowed?

3742
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:23,310
Oh, God.

3743
02:40:24,230 --> 02:40:25,150
Oh, God.

3744
02:40:25,230 --> 02:40:25,430
Okay.

3745
02:40:26,530 --> 02:40:27,250
Okay.

3746
02:40:29,150 --> 02:40:30,410
What the fuck?

3747
02:40:30,530 --> 02:40:32,290
How is he allowed to do that?

3748
02:40:32,430 --> 02:40:33,250
How the...

3749
02:40:33,250 --> 02:40:35,410
Boy, how is he allowed to do that?

3750
02:40:36,050 --> 02:40:37,390
That's... what?

3751
02:40:37,570 --> 02:40:37,890
Ow!

3752
02:40:39,170 --> 02:40:39,890
Ow!

3753
02:40:42,970 --> 02:40:43,770
Not fair!

3754
02:40:45,690 --> 02:40:47,290
What the fuck?

3755
02:40:48,330 --> 02:40:50,230
He's allowed to dodge?

3756
02:40:51,270 --> 02:40:54,170
He's allowed to dodge?

3757
02:40:54,170 --> 02:40:55,110
Okay.

3758
02:40:55,450 --> 02:40:56,950
Oh, he killed his own guy.

3759
02:40:57,130 --> 02:40:57,770
That's good.

3760
02:40:57,990 --> 02:40:59,530
That's actually really good for me.

3761
02:40:59,950 --> 02:41:01,270
That's fucking right.

3762
02:41:01,850 --> 02:41:03,110
Can't block this.

3763
02:41:03,930 --> 02:41:05,090
Can't block this.

3764
02:41:06,050 --> 02:41:07,130
That's fucking...

3765
02:41:07,130 --> 02:41:10,090
You don't need a block.

3766
02:41:10,250 --> 02:41:10,550
Okay.

3767
02:41:12,050 --> 02:41:14,050
You don't need a block.

3768
02:41:14,370 --> 02:41:15,830
And that's okay.

3769
02:41:16,450 --> 02:41:18,130
I'm just gonna hydrate again.

3770
02:41:19,950 --> 02:41:21,670
Gonna keep hydrating.

3771
02:41:24,170 --> 02:41:24,370
Alright.

3772
02:41:24,550 --> 02:41:26,230
Okay, this guy is strong.

3773
02:41:26,590 --> 02:41:27,550
This... Wow!

3774
02:41:29,450 --> 02:41:31,470
This guy is very strong, guys.

3775
02:41:31,670 --> 02:41:33,410
This... Oh, my God.

3776
02:41:33,470 --> 02:41:33,850
I...

3777
02:41:33,850 --> 02:41:34,450
Okay.

3778
02:41:35,130 --> 02:41:37,110
What are your patterns?

3779
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:39,910
Like... What the fuck?

3780
02:41:40,330 --> 02:41:41,930
Holy shit!

3781
02:41:42,170 --> 02:41:43,870
He's not even human!

3782
02:41:46,150 --> 02:41:46,830
Okay.

3783
02:41:48,890 --> 02:41:49,810
Oh, God.

3784
02:41:52,830 --> 02:41:53,510
Okay.

3785
02:41:54,170 --> 02:41:54,650
Knocked him.

3786
02:41:54,850 --> 02:41:57,290
No, I was trying to use freeze, but I messed up.

3787
02:41:59,870 --> 02:42:01,650
You're not even human!

3788
02:42:05,090 --> 02:42:05,690
Nice.

3789
02:42:05,970 --> 02:42:06,570
Okay.

3790
02:42:08,850 --> 02:42:09,570
Oh, wait.

3791
02:42:09,590 --> 02:42:10,070
I have...

3792
02:42:10,070 --> 02:42:11,570
Dragon time.

3793
02:42:11,970 --> 02:42:13,050
That's fucking right.

3794
02:42:14,030 --> 02:42:14,990
Dragon time.

3795
02:42:15,150 --> 02:42:16,190
Oh, that's okay.

3796
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:17,890
Dragon time.

3797
02:42:19,070 --> 02:42:21,190
The slowest dragon mode ever.

3798
02:42:21,870 --> 02:42:22,810
Dragon time.

3799
02:42:24,110 --> 02:42:24,590
Yeah!

3800
02:42:24,690 --> 02:42:25,770
We did it!

3801
02:42:27,650 --> 02:42:28,130
Alright.

3802
02:42:28,470 --> 02:42:29,530
Commander Beetle.

3803
02:42:29,690 --> 02:42:31,870
When faced with traps, one must pass the test.

3804
02:42:32,170 --> 02:42:33,670
When fortune smells...

3805
02:42:33,670 --> 02:42:34,510
Oh, there he is.

3806
02:42:34,550 --> 02:42:35,370
Look at his tiny head.

3807
02:42:38,010 --> 02:42:38,490
Nice.

3808
02:42:38,550 --> 02:42:39,090
We did it.

3809
02:42:39,890 --> 02:42:40,370
Oh!

3810
02:42:40,570 --> 02:42:41,710
It's a summon, too!

3811
02:42:42,530 --> 02:42:43,010
Nice!

3812
02:42:43,650 --> 02:42:44,550
I like that.

3813
02:42:45,550 --> 02:42:47,070
This is for the tiger.

3814
02:42:49,650 --> 02:42:51,370
This is for all the tigers!

3815
02:42:51,490 --> 02:42:52,070
You said no!

3816
02:42:53,970 --> 02:42:54,490
Alright.

3817
02:42:54,610 --> 02:42:55,890
Commander Beetle.

3818
02:42:57,670 --> 02:42:58,190
Alright.

3819
02:42:58,410 --> 02:42:58,850
Nice.

3820
02:42:58,870 --> 02:42:59,830
There's a chest here, too.

3821
02:43:02,190 --> 02:43:03,090
What did I get?

3822
02:43:05,750 --> 02:43:06,270
Oh!

3823
02:43:07,250 --> 02:43:08,190
A tablet.

3824
02:43:08,730 --> 02:43:10,930
Tablet of the Three Supremes.

3825
02:43:10,970 --> 02:43:11,490
Curious.

3826
02:43:12,210 --> 02:43:14,610
No idea what that is, but I assume it's helpful.

3827
02:43:15,710 --> 02:43:16,230
Alright.

3828
02:43:16,290 --> 02:43:21,030
Now that we killed the master, they have nobody else to follow.

3829
02:43:22,070 --> 02:43:23,970
Your master is dead now, sir.

3830
02:43:24,510 --> 02:43:25,230
He's dead.

3831
02:43:26,810 --> 02:43:28,470
Like, what are you still doing here?

3832
02:43:29,530 --> 02:43:30,550
He's literally dead.

3833
02:43:33,630 --> 02:43:35,650
There's no reason to be here anymore.

3834
02:43:36,950 --> 02:43:38,270
That's not the master?

3835
02:43:38,490 --> 02:43:39,230
What the fuck?

3836
02:43:40,650 --> 02:43:41,850
Who the fuck was he?

3837
02:43:44,010 --> 02:43:44,490
Wait!

3838
02:43:45,350 --> 02:43:47,690
If he's not the master, then what was he doing?

3839
02:43:48,710 --> 02:43:50,370
Why was he commanding them?

3840
02:43:52,830 --> 02:43:53,870
That's all...

3841
02:43:53,870 --> 02:43:56,930
Oh, so the master doesn't give a fuck about beetles?

3842
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:01,930
Like, he was uglier than a tiger!

3843
02:44:07,090 --> 02:44:08,410
But he was...

3844
02:44:08,410 --> 02:44:10,510
He was uglier than a tiger!

3845
02:44:10,710 --> 02:44:11,830
What's wrong with tigers?

3846
02:44:11,990 --> 02:44:13,150
I don't understand!

3847
02:44:14,290 --> 02:44:15,690
I don't understand.

3848
02:44:16,630 --> 02:44:17,350
Like...

3849
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:20,030
That's too far.

3850
02:44:22,730 --> 02:44:25,030
He's the guy that was racist to tigers!

3851
02:44:25,190 --> 02:44:26,630
And I'm going too far!

3852
02:44:27,710 --> 02:44:29,530
I wasn't racist to tigers!

3853
02:44:30,490 --> 02:44:31,670
I just killed him!

3854
02:44:31,890 --> 02:44:33,070
But that doesn't mean I'm racist!

3855
02:44:35,250 --> 02:44:36,350
He started it!

3856
02:44:40,630 --> 02:44:42,110
What's wrong with beetles?

3857
02:44:42,150 --> 02:44:43,470
I don't know what's wrong with tigers!

3858
02:44:43,470 --> 02:44:43,490
I don't know what's wrong with tigers!

3859
02:44:47,790 --> 02:44:49,650
Beetleman is beautiful!

3860
02:44:50,710 --> 02:44:51,970
Beetleman is beautiful!

3861
02:44:52,630 --> 02:44:55,970
Yeah, he started it and I ended it!

3862
02:44:56,110 --> 02:44:57,910
Circle of life, baby!

3863
02:45:03,030 --> 02:45:04,650
Alright, let's go!

3864
02:45:08,130 --> 02:45:09,770
Oh, is there anything here?

3865
02:45:10,050 --> 02:45:11,610
Oh, there's a tunnel here!

3866
02:45:11,950 --> 02:45:12,230
Oh, there's a tunnel here!

3867
02:45:13,410 --> 02:45:14,830
Oh, there's more worms!

3868
02:45:15,990 --> 02:45:19,790
Guys, I'm starting to think the master isn't a fucking human.

3869
02:45:20,150 --> 02:45:20,590
Guys, I'm starting to think the master isn't a fucking human.

3870
02:45:20,590 --> 02:45:21,010
I'm starting...

3871
02:45:22,590 --> 02:45:22,890
Guys!

3872
02:45:23,890 --> 02:45:26,390
I think the master is a fucking bug!

3873
02:45:27,170 --> 02:45:28,770
I don't know, guys.

3874
02:45:29,010 --> 02:45:30,750
I'm starting to get a feeling...

3875
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:33,910
That there's a pattern here.

3876
02:45:39,430 --> 02:45:40,030
Alright...

3877
02:45:40,030 --> 02:45:40,650
Oh...

3878
02:45:43,030 --> 02:45:43,630
Envy!

3879
02:45:43,750 --> 02:45:44,750
Thank you for the super chat!

3880
02:45:44,830 --> 02:45:45,150
Thank you!

3881
02:45:47,730 --> 02:45:48,530
Beetle also human!

3882
02:45:48,650 --> 02:45:50,190
Master turned him into a beetle!

3883
02:45:50,250 --> 02:45:52,570
Beetle longed for death and thank you when he died!

3884
02:45:52,770 --> 02:45:53,170
Oh, see!

3885
02:45:53,350 --> 02:45:54,390
Look, I did a good thing!

3886
02:45:54,870 --> 02:45:55,970
I'm not a monster!

3887
02:45:57,690 --> 02:45:59,070
They asked for it!

3888
02:46:02,290 --> 02:46:03,670
Another area here...

3889
02:46:03,670 --> 02:46:04,530
Secret?

3890
02:46:04,790 --> 02:46:05,670
No, it's not secret.

3891
02:46:06,490 --> 02:46:07,330
Not secret?

3892
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:12,320
Alright...

3893
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:13,280
Up we go!

3894
02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:16,800
Oh, no!

3895
02:46:16,860 --> 02:46:17,440
It's not linear!

3896
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:19,620
Oh, no!

3897
02:46:21,140 --> 02:46:22,960
People when they see open world will be like...

3898
02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:23,820
Yay, open world!

3899
02:46:23,860 --> 02:46:25,340
Me, when I see an open world...

3900
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:26,040
Where do I...

3901
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:26,880
No, no...

3902
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:28,380
Where do I go?

3903
02:46:31,360 --> 02:46:34,600
Guys, you don't understand.

3904
02:46:38,820 --> 02:46:42,360
Okay, this way.

3905
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:45,560
Alright...

3906
02:46:46,100 --> 02:46:47,140
Sorry, my brain...

3907
02:46:47,140 --> 02:46:49,560
I saw the non-linear pathway...

3908
02:46:49,560 --> 02:46:51,040
And then my brain just...

3909
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:52,380
I just didn't know what to do.

3910
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:56,400
It wasn't linear.

3911
02:46:59,660 --> 02:47:01,100
So I got confused.

3912
02:47:05,380 --> 02:47:06,500
Alright, oh, this way?

3913
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:07,820
This first?

3914
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:08,520
Okay.

3915
02:47:09,080 --> 02:47:10,360
That's right side, right?

3916
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:14,020
Oh, hey, another tiger!

3917
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:17,100
Jesus, there's so many tigers.

3918
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:19,700
I really hated the tigers.

3919
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:23,540
Why did so many of them wanted to be disciples?

3920
02:47:26,360 --> 02:47:29,280
Okay, I'm just gonna make sure there's like nothing here.

3921
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:30,480
Oh, there's a meditation!

3922
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:34,280
Let's just get rid of these guys then.

3923
02:47:34,520 --> 02:47:34,580
Let's just get rid of these guys then.

3924
02:47:36,580 --> 02:47:37,160
Boop!

3925
02:47:38,890 --> 02:47:39,540
This way.

3926
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:41,040
Alright.

3927
02:47:43,060 --> 02:47:43,960
Let's meditate.

3928
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:44,940
Can I meditate?

3929
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:45,200
Wow!

3930
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:48,380
Alright.

3931
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:48,640
Let's get rid of it.

3932
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:53,560
Please!

3933
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:54,260
Please!

3934
02:47:54,280 --> 02:47:55,400
Please don't kill me!

3935
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:59,000
I can't!

3936
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,180
I don't know the meditation phrase!

3937
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:06,820
I swear if I like get back in it, I die!

3938
02:48:07,280 --> 02:48:09,120
I lose like half my life!

3939
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:10,800
Please!

3940
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:11,680
Please!

3941
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:14,020
Time out of meditation!

3942
02:48:14,120 --> 02:48:14,860
Wait, where did it go?

3943
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:15,960
What?

3944
02:48:19,980 --> 02:48:20,620
Please!

3945
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:23,300
Where did they go?

3946
02:48:24,180 --> 02:48:25,680
Oh my god, my HP.

3947
02:48:25,840 --> 02:48:30,620
I think I actually did lose HP from them beating the shit out of me.

3948
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:31,420
I...

3949
02:48:32,940 --> 02:48:33,580
Okay.

3950
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:35,880
Alright, it's fine.

3951
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:36,700
We're okay.

3952
02:48:37,260 --> 02:48:38,380
We're okay.

3953
02:48:40,580 --> 02:48:41,280
Oh shit.

3954
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:43,160
There's so many worms!

3955
02:48:43,420 --> 02:48:44,340
Oh my god!

3956
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:45,640
Let me go!

3957
02:48:47,740 --> 02:48:48,940
Jesus Christ!

3958
02:48:49,100 --> 02:48:50,100
There's so many!

3959
02:48:50,220 --> 02:48:51,480
Okay, we gotta do this now.

3960
02:48:53,300 --> 02:48:54,160
Okay, nice.

3961
02:48:55,980 --> 02:48:56,580
Oh...

3962
02:48:56,580 --> 02:49:02,820
Yeah, I'm pretty sure like when I meditated, it healed back the HP they did to me.

3963
02:49:03,700 --> 02:49:05,080
Oh, it's the tiger!

3964
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:07,300
Stop looking around.

3965
02:49:07,300 --> 02:49:07,820
I'm going in.

3966
02:49:08,660 --> 02:49:10,380
Go fork my monkeys!

3967
02:49:11,280 --> 02:49:11,500
Go fork!

3968
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:13,900
It's time to beat up a tiger!

3969
02:49:14,320 --> 02:49:14,800
Monkeys?

3970
02:49:15,660 --> 02:49:16,140
Monkeys?

3971
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:19,260
Okay, you came here after I started.

3972
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:19,660
Okay.

3973
02:49:20,140 --> 02:49:20,820
That's fine.

3974
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:23,260
That's okay.

3975
02:49:24,580 --> 02:49:25,060
Sorry.

3976
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:26,220
My monkeys got this.

3977
02:49:26,840 --> 02:49:28,960
I believe in the power of monkey.

3978
02:49:30,860 --> 02:49:31,800
Oh my god.

3979
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:34,760
Alright, all my monkeys are dead, but that's okay.

3980
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:36,760
Because what is he gonna do?

3981
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:38,240
Oh, he's gonna do that!

3982
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:39,460
He's gonna do that!

3983
02:49:39,880 --> 02:49:41,140
What is he gonna do?

3984
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:41,600
Now.

3985
02:49:41,680 --> 02:49:44,720
I spent all my resources on this one tiger.

3986
02:49:46,240 --> 02:49:47,560
Monkeys were lost.

3987
02:49:49,100 --> 02:49:49,860
That's fine.

3988
02:49:50,640 --> 02:49:51,960
It was worth it.

3989
02:49:52,580 --> 02:49:54,180
It was so worth it.

3990
02:49:54,380 --> 02:49:56,580
It was a very strong tiger!

3991
02:49:59,440 --> 02:50:00,760
Monkeys needed a map.

3992
02:50:01,460 --> 02:50:04,440
The monkeys reflected me and I was also lost.

3993
02:50:04,520 --> 02:50:05,980
So then they were also lost too.

3994
02:50:06,480 --> 02:50:08,160
It's understandable, you know?

3995
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:09,260
Like we were both...

3996
02:50:09,260 --> 02:50:10,960
We were both lost.

3997
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:13,280
Oh hey, it's him!

3998
02:50:14,600 --> 02:50:15,320
It's him!

3999
02:50:15,460 --> 02:50:17,880
It's the guy that Yellow Lone possessed.

4000
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:22,040
I'm gonna steal this first before I talk to you.

4001
02:50:41,220 --> 02:50:43,280
That was inspirational.

4002
02:51:12,480 --> 02:51:13,000
Oh!

4003
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:16,480
Look, she gave up everything for him!

4004
02:51:16,760 --> 02:51:17,380
For love!

4005
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:19,960
And for... oh shit, sorry.

4006
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:21,600
My phone.

4007
02:51:22,360 --> 02:51:26,620
My phone charger wasn't charging.

4008
02:51:26,980 --> 02:51:28,040
Is it charging now?

4009
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:29,880
I'm gonna be loading right now.

4010
02:51:29,940 --> 02:51:31,540
No, it's not charging.

4011
02:51:32,940 --> 02:51:33,740
Can't tell.

4012
02:51:34,140 --> 02:51:34,800
Is it?

4013
02:51:34,940 --> 02:51:35,940
Okay, I think it is.

4014
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:38,180
I think it's charging now.

4015
02:51:38,180 --> 02:51:38,960
Sorry!

4016
02:51:40,660 --> 02:51:42,220
I might need a new charger.

4017
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:44,920
I might need a new cable.

4018
02:51:46,420 --> 02:51:47,600
I'm gonna grab... oh.

4019
02:51:47,720 --> 02:51:49,180
Get rid of this worm first.

4020
02:51:50,940 --> 02:51:51,920
That's why I was loading.

4021
02:51:52,160 --> 02:51:54,620
I had... I didn't have battery left.

4022
02:51:59,350 --> 02:51:59,870
Alright.

4023
02:52:00,470 --> 02:52:00,990
Nice.

4024
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:03,730
Okay, I just wanna grab this.

4025
02:52:04,530 --> 02:52:05,970
The rest of you don't matter.

4026
02:52:08,990 --> 02:52:09,770
Alright, nice.

4027
02:52:10,130 --> 02:52:10,510
I'll just head off.

4028
02:52:10,610 --> 02:52:11,050
Bye guys!

4029
02:52:12,710 --> 02:52:13,350
Bye!

4030
02:52:15,250 --> 02:52:17,130
Go do your worm things here.

4031
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:22,040
Alright, up we go.

4032
02:52:22,560 --> 02:52:24,920
This is a surprisingly long chapter.

4033
02:52:25,640 --> 02:52:29,020
I thought chapter 3 was long, but this one is like...

4034
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:30,020
longer.

4035
02:52:33,980 --> 02:52:41,200
But I like this chapter more than... I definitely like this chapter more than the snow chapter.

4036
02:52:41,280 --> 02:52:42,580
The snow chapter fucking sucked.

4037
02:52:46,660 --> 02:52:51,320
I can navigate this much better.

4038
02:52:51,480 --> 02:52:52,400
That's for sure.

4039
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:55,840
I definitely feel like I can navigate this better.

4040
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:58,440
I like this chapter more.

4041
02:52:58,660 --> 02:53:01,040
I like the story more too for this one.

4042
02:53:02,400 --> 02:53:04,160
Versus the chapter 3.

4043
02:53:10,010 --> 02:53:11,330
Alright, here we go.

4044
02:53:11,810 --> 02:53:14,470
Oh, chapter 5 is more fun overall.

4045
02:53:16,050 --> 02:53:17,150
I'm chapter 4, right?

4046
02:53:17,330 --> 02:53:18,950
Wait, which chapter am I on?

4047
02:53:19,350 --> 02:53:19,710
I...

4048
02:53:21,850 --> 02:53:22,850
Wait a minute.

4049
02:53:23,250 --> 02:53:23,790
Wait a minute.

4050
02:53:23,830 --> 02:53:25,190
Guys, which chapter am I on?

4051
02:53:25,390 --> 02:53:25,970
Oh, I'm on 4.

4052
02:53:26,050 --> 02:53:26,890
Okay, I was like...

4053
02:53:26,890 --> 02:53:28,090
Wait, am I on chapter 5?

4054
02:53:28,230 --> 02:53:30,670
So I got...

4055
02:53:30,670 --> 02:53:32,770
I got confused.

4056
02:53:33,830 --> 02:53:34,630
Okay, this is 4.

4057
02:53:35,510 --> 02:53:37,090
I thought I was on 4.

4058
02:53:37,770 --> 02:53:39,130
Why did they bring up 5?

4059
02:53:43,090 --> 02:53:44,290
Guys, which one is optional?

4060
02:53:47,370 --> 02:53:48,330
Right or left?

4061
02:53:48,470 --> 02:53:48,770
Right or left?

4062
02:53:48,930 --> 02:53:49,930
Chat, which one...

4063
02:53:49,930 --> 02:53:52,030
Which one is the optional one?

4064
02:53:55,950 --> 02:53:57,090
Optional errors to the right?

4065
02:53:58,250 --> 02:53:58,670
Optional errors to the right?

4066
02:54:00,150 --> 02:54:01,510
Okay, we go right side.

4067
02:54:03,390 --> 02:54:03,970
Worm guy.

4068
02:54:06,570 --> 02:54:08,350
Alright, get rid of the worm guy first.

4069
02:54:09,870 --> 02:54:10,710
Get out of here.

4070
02:54:11,270 --> 02:54:12,850
Oh, get left first for the shrine?

4071
02:54:13,030 --> 02:54:14,890
Okay, I want to steal his stuff first.

4072
02:54:15,250 --> 02:54:17,490
I want to steal his stuff and then I'll go left.

4073
02:54:19,670 --> 02:54:20,470
Alright, nice.

4074
02:54:21,190 --> 02:54:21,970
Mine now.

4075
02:54:22,330 --> 02:54:22,810
Yoink.

4076
02:54:22,990 --> 02:54:23,830
There's a shrine.

4077
02:54:25,090 --> 02:54:26,190
There's a shrine here?

4078
02:54:30,340 --> 02:54:30,820
Okay.

4079
02:54:30,940 --> 02:54:32,120
I'm going to kill you first.

4080
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:35,280
And then your buddy can watch because apparently he likes that.

4081
02:54:35,620 --> 02:54:36,500
Alright, there you go.

4082
02:54:36,520 --> 02:54:36,980
He's dead now.

4083
02:54:37,080 --> 02:54:37,620
You can come...

4084
02:54:37,620 --> 02:54:39,840
Oh shit, there's a tiger!

4085
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:41,400
There's another one?

4086
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:44,200
Oh my god.

4087
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:46,000
Okay, we'll just leave him there.

4088
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:48,680
Alright.

4089
02:54:49,800 --> 02:54:53,360
Bro, he cursed so many ti- He could have had a tiger army!

4090
02:54:54,820 --> 02:54:57,580
He literally could have had a tiger army!

4091
02:55:00,660 --> 02:55:01,620
Okay, rest.

4092
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:05,560
Alright, let's go.

4093
02:55:07,310 --> 02:55:08,320
Can't believe it!

4094
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:12,240
I can't believe he actually ditched the tigers!

4095
02:55:14,360 --> 02:55:15,900
He could have had it all!

4096
02:55:17,200 --> 02:55:20,440
Mad made it his mission to bully the tigers.

4097
02:55:23,060 --> 02:55:25,720
This is the year of the worm.

4098
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:28,640
Apparently.

4099
02:55:31,180 --> 02:55:32,380
Okay, I'm going to recharge.

4100
02:55:33,100 --> 02:55:33,740
Reload!

4101
02:55:36,780 --> 02:55:39,820
Okay, I didn't expect the slash there.

4102
02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:41,640
Look at him!

4103
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:42,760
He's so clumsy too!

4104
02:55:43,720 --> 02:55:45,320
He like fell over!

4105
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,040
After like one fucking slash.

4106
02:55:50,340 --> 02:55:51,660
What a clumsy worm.

4107
02:55:55,980 --> 02:55:57,620
Alright, let's get this guy out of the way.

4108
02:55:58,760 --> 02:55:59,600
Get out of here.

4109
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:04,220
Guys, I didn't miss any loot.

4110
02:56:05,440 --> 02:56:06,220
It was...

4111
02:56:06,220 --> 02:56:08,900
I bet you it was fucking iron leaves again.

4112
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,460
I have like 200 million iron leaves.

4113
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:12,480
Guys, I don't need more.

4114
02:56:12,980 --> 02:56:14,720
Guys, I don't need more iron leaves.

4115
02:56:20,040 --> 02:56:23,260
I guess I have too many iron leaves.

4116
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:23,440
I guess I have too many iron leaves.

4117
02:56:23,440 --> 02:56:24,200
We don't need more.

4118
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:28,400
Like I don't need more I'm not doing anything.

4119
02:56:30,340 --> 02:56:30,960
Alright.

4120
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:33,420
Let's see.

4121
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:34,740
Oh no.

4122
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:35,940
Multiple choice.

4123
02:56:36,320 --> 02:56:38,140
I assume left side is optional?

4124
02:56:40,840 --> 02:56:42,700
It looks like an optional area.

4125
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:45,220
It looks like an optional area.

4126
02:56:45,220 --> 02:56:45,540
Oh no.

4127
02:56:46,060 --> 02:56:47,820
Which was the optional area?

4128
02:56:48,540 --> 02:56:49,060
Which...

4129
02:56:54,860 --> 02:56:56,200
Oh, it's a boss?

4130
02:56:56,460 --> 02:56:57,580
Okay, I'll go for the boss.

4131
02:56:59,760 --> 02:57:00,900
Both were optional.

4132
02:57:00,940 --> 02:57:02,300
The other route is...

4133
02:57:02,300 --> 02:57:02,620
Okay.

4134
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:04,940
We'll go this way.

4135
02:57:05,720 --> 02:57:07,420
Just too many optional areas.

4136
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:11,140
Alright, this looks like a boss fight.

4137
02:57:12,140 --> 02:57:13,080
The fuck is...

4138
02:57:13,080 --> 02:57:14,480
Oh, is that the...

4139
02:57:15,700 --> 02:57:18,780
Wait, was that the child I forced to be burned?

4140
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:22,760
Yeah!

4141
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:23,560
That's him!

4142
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:27,600
What's wrong with that?

4143
02:57:28,380 --> 02:57:28,860
What's wrong with that?

4144
02:57:29,180 --> 02:57:30,780
You're alive because of me.

4145
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:32,480
You were stuck... Oh, fuck!

4146
02:57:32,620 --> 02:57:33,500
I'm so sorry.

4147
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:35,120
I guess he didn't want to be alive.

4148
02:57:35,360 --> 02:57:36,040
I don't fucking know.

4149
02:57:36,340 --> 02:57:36,820
Like...

4150
02:57:36,820 --> 02:57:37,520
Like...

4151
02:57:38,520 --> 02:57:41,240
Like, he realized being alive fucks being...

4152
02:57:41,240 --> 02:57:43,420
Now he has to pay taxes and he hates it.

4153
02:57:44,320 --> 02:57:46,520
He's like, how dare you!

4154
02:57:47,180 --> 02:57:50,080
Now I have to pay my taxes!

4155
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:54,740
Now I have to get a job!

4156
02:57:56,820 --> 02:57:58,480
Life is suffering.

4157
02:57:58,720 --> 02:58:01,120
I have to look into housing!

4158
02:58:02,540 --> 02:58:03,400
And insurance!

4159
02:58:03,400 --> 02:58:06,100
And credit score!

4160
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:09,000
And credit score!

4161
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:09,660
Because of you!

4162
02:58:10,020 --> 02:58:12,200
I never asked to be born!

4163
02:58:12,940 --> 02:58:13,060
My life!

4164
02:58:13,900 --> 02:58:15,840
Ru-luan fei-sheng!

4165
02:58:17,780 --> 02:58:19,860
Wu-yong-de zhi-jie-chi-la!

4166
02:58:20,420 --> 02:58:21,020
Wu-yong-de zhi-jie-chi-la!

4167
02:58:21,020 --> 02:58:22,080
Oh, I took all his limbs off.

4168
02:58:23,080 --> 02:58:25,640
Shi-wo shang-la-nei lao-dao-shi-de-dang!

4169
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:26,100
Shi-wo shang-la-nei lao-dao-shi-de-dang!

4170
02:58:26,320 --> 02:58:28,140
Gang-cai-de du-dao!

4171
02:58:28,340 --> 02:58:31,540
Don't make me... Please don't make me get the job.

4172
02:58:31,540 --> 02:58:32,800
I'm the god of the gods.

4173
02:58:34,420 --> 02:58:37,340
I'm the god of the gods.

4174
02:58:37,340 --> 02:58:37,480
I'm the god of the gods.

4175
02:58:37,740 --> 02:58:37,960
I'm the god of the gods.

4176
02:58:38,140 --> 02:58:39,380
I am a fair fighter.

4177
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:41,640
I'm a dragon lady now.

4178
02:58:42,440 --> 02:58:43,960
What the fuck he took away?

4179
02:58:44,380 --> 02:58:44,940
What?!

4180
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:50,980
He took away my abilities!

4181
02:58:51,880 --> 02:58:52,660
That's fucked.

4182
02:58:54,340 --> 02:58:56,220
He actually took away my stuff.

4183
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:58,280
Like that's so illegal.

4184
02:58:58,280 --> 02:58:59,840
That should be illegal!

4185
02:58:59,840 --> 02:59:02,440
That should be illegal!

4186
02:59:03,420 --> 02:59:04,430
And he healed?!

4187
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:06,320
How dare you!

4188
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:07,660
I'm the main character!

4189
02:59:08,280 --> 02:59:10,280
How could you just heal like that?

4190
02:59:10,700 --> 02:59:12,120
Just like what I'm gonna do.

4191
02:59:16,900 --> 02:59:20,240
Just because I took your arms you get to heal?

4192
02:59:20,740 --> 02:59:21,160
Just because I took your arms you get to heal?

4193
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:22,280
Like, what?!

4194
02:59:24,660 --> 02:59:25,280
Alright.

4195
02:59:25,500 --> 02:59:26,460
It's not fair.

4196
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:26,960
Alright.

4197
02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:26,960
It's not fair.

4198
02:59:28,280 --> 02:59:30,440
I should not be able to heal if I took away his arms.

4199
02:59:30,620 --> 02:59:30,920
Like...

4200
02:59:31,580 --> 02:59:33,540
Like we all have to struggle here.

4201
02:59:34,740 --> 02:59:35,320
Like...

4202
02:59:38,180 --> 02:59:39,280
Oh my god.

4203
02:59:39,620 --> 02:59:42,780
Even though he's buff he still fights like a baby.

4204
02:59:43,420 --> 02:59:43,860
Like...

4205
02:59:43,860 --> 02:59:46,500
Bro thinks he's the protagonist.

4206
02:59:51,240 --> 02:59:52,020
Fine, Nino.

4207
02:59:52,600 --> 02:59:53,900
I already had Nino.

4208
02:59:53,900 --> 02:59:54,000
I already had Nino.

4209
03:00:02,870 --> 03:00:04,130
Oh I did it!

4210
03:00:04,470 --> 03:00:04,570
Oh I did it!

4211
03:00:16,590 --> 03:00:17,850
Oh that was easy.

4212
03:00:18,570 --> 03:00:18,930
Alright.

4213
03:00:20,270 --> 03:00:20,990
Go!

4214
03:00:24,520 --> 03:00:25,580
What happens?

4215
03:00:27,800 --> 03:00:28,520
Woah!

4216
03:00:33,500 --> 03:00:34,220
Woah!

4217
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:35,300
Woah!

4218
03:00:35,300 --> 03:00:36,040
It's so beautiful!

4219
03:00:37,960 --> 03:00:38,680
What

4220
03:00:41,770 --> 03:00:43,130
is this place?

4221
03:00:43,570 --> 03:00:43,630
What is this place?

4222
03:00:44,910 --> 03:00:45,630
Obsession.

4223
03:00:45,630 --> 03:00:50,610
A remnant of worldly ties transforms the unfinished aspirations into spaces.

4224
03:00:51,370 --> 03:00:52,970
Secret in purple cloud.

4225
03:00:53,470 --> 03:00:56,710
What use are eight arms against twenty strikes of my staff?

4226
03:00:57,010 --> 03:00:57,650
What use are eight arms against twenty strikes of my staff?

4227
03:00:57,650 --> 03:00:57,670
True.

4228
03:01:02,190 --> 03:01:03,250
Secret tunnel.

4229
03:01:03,890 --> 03:01:06,090
The best looking area in the game.

4230
03:01:06,210 --> 03:01:07,110
Oh no, my frames.

4231
03:01:07,630 --> 03:01:11,890
Not the best looking area in all I can think about is...

4232
03:01:11,890 --> 03:01:12,250
Not the best looking area in all I can think about is...

4233
03:01:12,250 --> 03:01:13,090
No, no, my frames.

4234
03:01:13,270 --> 03:01:14,930
Oh no, there's so many leaves.

4235
03:01:14,930 --> 03:01:15,830
There's so...

4236
03:01:16,690 --> 03:01:18,710
Look at all these physics!

4237
03:01:23,190 --> 03:01:25,070
Oh no, the foliage!

4238
03:01:25,550 --> 03:01:26,470
The foliage!

4239
03:01:26,830 --> 03:01:27,950
The leaves!

4240
03:01:29,570 --> 03:01:31,010
Oh there's the mountain!

4241
03:01:33,110 --> 03:01:34,410
That's not a cloud.

4242
03:01:34,570 --> 03:01:36,370
That's literally like vines in the sky.

4243
03:01:43,100 --> 03:01:44,700
Who's crying?

4244
03:01:46,400 --> 03:01:46,800
Hello?

4245
03:01:52,040 --> 03:01:53,540
Are you okay, lady?

4246
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:56,180
Oh, it's a snake!

4247
03:02:01,300 --> 03:02:04,340
A kind passerby will help you find your remains?

4248
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:05,760
Well, that's not me.

4249
03:02:08,060 --> 03:02:13,040
Imagine if I just walk up, she's like crying, and I'm just like walk away.

4250
03:02:16,660 --> 03:02:18,260
Why are you crying?

4251
03:02:18,260 --> 03:02:18,680
Why are you crying?

4252
03:02:19,380 --> 03:02:20,280
Little Master.

4253
03:02:22,480 --> 03:02:23,460
I'm a little lost.

4254
03:02:25,840 --> 03:02:26,540
I'm a little lost.

4255
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:27,240
I was originally from the Wei Dynasty.

4256
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:29,560
I came here to see my father.

4257
03:02:30,240 --> 03:02:32,340
Not my problem.

4258
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:39,580
My husband and I lived in the manor on the top of the mountain.

4259
03:02:39,580 --> 03:02:40,480
What happened to your husband?

4260
03:02:40,840 --> 03:02:44,180
One day, I don't know where I got the poison from.

4261
03:02:44,200 --> 03:02:45,780
I had to fight for it.

4262
03:02:46,900 --> 03:02:49,100
The manor is full of dead people.

4263
03:02:49,100 --> 03:02:50,900
Oh, you're the lone survivor?

4264
03:02:51,720 --> 03:02:53,340
Why didn't you slither away?

4265
03:03:03,460 --> 03:03:04,860
The scorpion way.

4266
03:03:09,260 --> 03:03:09,900
Oh!

4267
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:11,660
That's what happened.

4268
03:03:12,980 --> 03:03:16,820
Wait, I have a guy that's really lonely, you know?

4269
03:03:17,680 --> 03:03:20,840
And like, you have zero limbs, too.

4270
03:03:21,060 --> 03:03:22,980
So like, it'd be a nice change of pace.

4271
03:03:28,460 --> 03:03:31,280
You know, from eight limbs to zero?

4272
03:03:31,480 --> 03:03:32,520
Like, oh my god.

4273
03:03:32,560 --> 03:03:33,220
That would be wild.

4274
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:44,380
And like, you have no kids, right?

4275
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:48,160
It's like, how many kids do you have?

4276
03:03:48,320 --> 03:03:54,200
You don't seem to have any children.

4277
03:04:00,440 --> 03:04:01,960
Alright, off we go.

4278
03:04:03,580 --> 03:04:04,980
I'm asking for a friend.

4279
03:04:07,280 --> 03:04:09,140
Bro, he's heartbroken, man.

4280
03:04:12,300 --> 03:04:16,600
He got tricked into paying for a million children's child support.

4281
03:04:17,700 --> 03:04:18,180
Alright,

4282
03:04:24,820 --> 03:04:25,320
here we go.

4283
03:04:25,540 --> 03:04:27,560
I thought he had one child, but no.

4284
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:31,300
It was more than the one child.

4285
03:04:35,300 --> 03:04:36,120
Oh, is that him?

4286
03:04:36,400 --> 03:04:37,480
Who the fuck is that?

4287
03:04:40,280 --> 03:04:41,240
Oh, that's a tree!

4288
03:04:42,820 --> 03:04:43,300
Good.

4289
03:04:43,740 --> 03:04:45,280
Time to beat up a tree.

4290
03:04:47,860 --> 03:04:48,760
It's time.

4291
03:04:49,720 --> 03:04:52,180
Time to beat up a fucking tree, guys.

4292
03:04:52,620 --> 03:04:55,460
This is what I've been wanting to do for a long time.

4293
03:04:56,580 --> 03:04:58,800
Trees had it too good for two's eyes.

4294
03:05:02,140 --> 03:05:03,860
These goddamn trees.

4295
03:05:05,780 --> 03:05:07,940
I don't need oxygen.

4296
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:09,180
I don't need O2.

4297
03:05:12,640 --> 03:05:13,900
That's fucking right.

4298
03:05:14,580 --> 03:05:15,860
Carbon dioxide.

4299
03:05:19,300 --> 03:05:20,500
No, donkey!

4300
03:05:21,400 --> 03:05:23,360
Don't spread the carbon dioxide!

4301
03:05:28,680 --> 03:05:29,780
There he goes.

4302
03:05:29,860 --> 03:05:30,580
So evil.

4303
03:05:30,640 --> 03:05:31,080
Absorb.

4304
03:05:39,180 --> 03:05:41,980
I'm gonna expel all the carbon dioxide now.

4305
03:05:46,800 --> 03:05:48,260
We're dying.

4306
03:05:51,480 --> 03:05:54,900
Alright, nice.

4307
03:05:55,240 --> 03:05:55,780
Nice.

4308
03:05:56,080 --> 03:05:57,400
I'm gonna kill the tree.

4309
03:05:57,740 --> 03:06:00,580
She has become the monster.

4310
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:01,520
Get her!

4311
03:06:01,700 --> 03:06:02,900
She's breathing!

4312
03:06:03,580 --> 03:06:05,260
Wait, there's another shrine?

4313
03:06:05,680 --> 03:06:07,360
Oh my god, how many shrines are there?

4314
03:06:11,100 --> 03:06:12,840
Take up the planet.

4315
03:06:14,200 --> 03:06:16,980
How bad can I be?

4316
03:06:17,260 --> 03:06:19,020
I'm destroying necessarily.

4317
03:06:22,240 --> 03:06:24,340
Alright, I'll get this shrine real quick.

4318
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:31,080
Okay.

4319
03:06:31,340 --> 03:06:32,540
A tree had it coming.

4320
03:06:32,720 --> 03:06:33,840
Oh my god, the foliage.

4321
03:06:34,340 --> 03:06:37,240
The leaf physics!

4322
03:06:37,860 --> 03:06:39,040
My friends!

4323
03:06:40,910 --> 03:06:42,380
The leaf physics!

4324
03:06:43,080 --> 03:06:45,420
This place is too beautiful!

4325
03:06:46,900 --> 03:06:49,440
It's too beautiful, guys!

4326
03:06:50,020 --> 03:06:50,940
This place!

4327
03:06:53,880 --> 03:06:55,140
Where do I go?

4328
03:06:58,520 --> 03:06:59,040
Okay.

4329
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:03,020
It's still a person, so like, he's gonna be easy to kill.

4330
03:07:04,020 --> 03:07:06,320
I thought I was supposed to deal with a scorpion king.

4331
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:07,140
Why are there people?

4332
03:07:08,800 --> 03:07:10,760
Like, why are there people here?

4333
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:12,720
I don't understand.

4334
03:07:13,660 --> 03:07:17,140
I thought I was supposed to be dealing with, like, bugs.

4335
03:07:18,560 --> 03:07:21,080
But the beauty, it burns!

4336
03:07:21,500 --> 03:07:24,200
Oh my god, the tree fucking stabbed me!

4337
03:07:26,140 --> 03:07:27,300
What the fuck?

4338
03:07:28,840 --> 03:07:30,540
It's cause I killed its leader.

4339
03:07:30,700 --> 03:07:31,520
It stabbed me.

4340
03:07:33,620 --> 03:07:34,540
Here we go.

4341
03:07:34,940 --> 03:07:36,260
Oh, I'll crab this, though.

4342
03:07:36,820 --> 03:07:37,940
Just in case.

4343
03:07:37,980 --> 03:07:38,940
Got the tree pearl.

4344
03:07:44,270 --> 03:07:44,910
Who's that?

4345
03:07:45,230 --> 03:07:46,290
Oh, is that the scorpion?

4346
03:07:46,390 --> 03:07:47,230
Oh, I already found him!

4347
03:07:48,330 --> 03:07:48,670
Go, go, go.

4348
03:07:49,730 --> 03:07:51,010
Are you depressed?

4349
03:07:53,230 --> 03:07:55,210
Look, you can just ask somebody if they're depressed.

4350
03:07:55,970 --> 03:07:57,210
I mean, look at him.

4351
03:07:57,270 --> 03:07:58,410
He's drinking on the roof.

4352
03:08:07,910 --> 03:08:09,190
Get down here!

4353
03:08:10,930 --> 03:08:12,170
Break your jars!

4354
03:08:13,410 --> 03:08:14,310
That's fucking...

4355
03:08:14,310 --> 03:08:14,890
Oh my god, wait.

4356
03:08:15,090 --> 03:08:16,330
He actually gets mad.

4357
03:08:16,870 --> 03:08:18,830
I didn't think he actually gets mad.

4358
03:08:22,430 --> 03:08:24,010
You chose the root.

4359
03:08:24,210 --> 03:08:24,970
Yeah, that's right.

4360
03:08:25,610 --> 03:08:26,910
That's fucking right!

4361
03:08:27,250 --> 03:08:29,570
I broke your jar.

4362
03:08:29,690 --> 03:08:31,390
What you gonna do about that?

4363
03:08:33,190 --> 03:08:33,830
Shit!

4364
03:08:38,050 --> 03:08:38,370
Okay.

4365
03:08:43,230 --> 03:08:49,430
I literally started to see my life flash before me there.

4366
03:08:49,770 --> 03:08:51,350
Holy shit!

4367
03:08:52,090 --> 03:08:53,370
Okay, okay.

4368
03:08:53,910 --> 03:08:54,670
Okay.

4369
03:08:57,390 --> 03:08:59,150
Oh my god.

4370
03:08:59,750 --> 03:09:03,870
Okay, now I know why it's called a depth stinger.

4371
03:09:04,210 --> 03:09:05,910
That makes more sense now.

4372
03:09:06,590 --> 03:09:09,310
Uh, don't mess with this.

4373
03:09:09,470 --> 03:09:13,410
Okay, now I know why it was called that.

4374
03:09:13,410 --> 03:09:15,210
How did I get there?

4375
03:09:16,130 --> 03:09:17,430
I don't even remember.

4376
03:09:17,570 --> 03:09:18,230
Oh, it's this way.

4377
03:09:18,330 --> 03:09:20,050
I was like, I don't even remember how I got there.

4378
03:09:22,330 --> 03:09:23,410
Oh my god.

4379
03:09:25,430 --> 03:09:26,530
Okay, it's this way.

4380
03:09:26,730 --> 03:09:27,690
Oh, I missed this.

4381
03:09:31,210 --> 03:09:32,390
He's up the stairs.

4382
03:09:32,530 --> 03:09:33,290
You don't need to go.

4383
03:09:33,390 --> 03:09:34,090
I'm gonna do it.

4384
03:09:34,450 --> 03:09:35,850
You can't stop me.

4385
03:09:37,590 --> 03:09:38,930
I'm gonna do it.

4386
03:09:39,850 --> 03:09:41,350
I walked a long way.

4387
03:09:43,410 --> 03:09:45,330
Oh, the stairs leads there.

4388
03:09:45,750 --> 03:09:46,030
Oh!

4389
03:09:48,410 --> 03:09:50,030
That's fucking right now!

4390
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:57,030
That's fucking right now I know what I'm doing.

4391
03:09:59,330 --> 03:10:00,150
Oh, god.

4392
03:10:00,350 --> 03:10:00,730
Oh!

4393
03:10:01,910 --> 03:10:04,350
Guys, this depth stinger is a little scary, guys.

4394
03:10:05,730 --> 03:10:06,850
Holy fuck!

4395
03:10:06,950 --> 03:10:07,330
Okay.

4396
03:10:08,410 --> 03:10:10,950
Okay, he's a little tanky, guys.

4397
03:10:13,690 --> 03:10:15,210
He's pretty tanky.

4398
03:10:15,210 --> 03:10:17,290
I just... What the fuck?

4399
03:10:17,390 --> 03:10:18,770
Holy shit!

4400
03:10:19,150 --> 03:10:21,930
Now I know why they call it the depth stinger.

4401
03:10:23,130 --> 03:10:25,130
Okay, I'm gonna use the two to heal.

4402
03:10:26,070 --> 03:10:27,150
Like, right now.

4403
03:10:27,410 --> 03:10:29,250
Like, right now.

4404
03:10:30,470 --> 03:10:33,690
Oh my god, he's so fucking tanky.

4405
03:10:33,730 --> 03:10:34,590
That's actually crazy.

4406
03:10:35,050 --> 03:10:35,550
Whoa!

4407
03:10:36,090 --> 03:10:36,670
What?

4408
03:10:38,430 --> 03:10:41,310
Bro, I just broke a couple of jars.

4409
03:10:43,410 --> 03:10:44,130
I don't understand!

4410
03:10:44,730 --> 03:10:45,110
Whoa!

4411
03:10:46,330 --> 03:10:47,490
Oh my

4412
03:10:51,260 --> 03:10:51,560
god!

4413
03:10:52,760 --> 03:10:53,340
Okay.

4414
03:10:53,560 --> 03:10:54,720
He does not like that!

4415
03:10:54,880 --> 03:10:56,260
He does not like that!

4416
03:10:57,140 --> 03:10:59,540
Guys, this guy is... This guy is pretty freaky.

4417
03:10:59,680 --> 03:11:00,640
Not gonna lie.

4418
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:02,480
What the fuck?

4419
03:11:03,160 --> 03:11:03,540
Okay.

4420
03:11:04,020 --> 03:11:04,600
Okay.

4421
03:11:06,100 --> 03:11:06,680
What?

4422
03:11:08,580 --> 03:11:09,440
Stop it!

4423
03:11:25,720 --> 03:11:27,320
Oh my god!

4424
03:11:27,340 --> 03:11:29,780
This guy is so fucking tanky!

4425
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:33,320
The poison actually got me!

4426
03:11:33,500 --> 03:11:35,000
Let me try the thrust dance.

4427
03:11:37,060 --> 03:11:38,260
Jesus Christ!

4428
03:11:38,300 --> 03:11:41,860
This guy... Oh wait, this was like, literally the easy path to him.

4429
03:11:43,980 --> 03:11:44,760
That's awkward.

4430
03:11:46,440 --> 03:11:47,840
Alright, I'm getting over.

4431
03:11:48,680 --> 03:11:49,880
I'm heading over.

4432
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:54,160
I wanna get in on that action.

4433
03:11:54,700 --> 03:11:55,560
That's fucking right.

4434
03:11:56,460 --> 03:11:57,660
Oh my god!

4435
03:11:57,760 --> 03:11:58,200
God!

4436
03:11:58,320 --> 03:12:00,020
He does so much damage!

4437
03:12:00,560 --> 03:12:02,660
There's no way I'm underleveled!

4438
03:12:02,660 --> 03:12:03,360
There's no way!

4439
03:12:03,760 --> 03:12:05,560
I refuse to!

4440
03:12:05,700 --> 03:12:07,940
Please, I don't wanna level up!

4441
03:12:10,460 --> 03:12:11,140
Okay.

4442
03:12:12,960 --> 03:12:13,640
Nice.

4443
03:12:13,640 --> 03:12:15,200
Jesus Christ!

4444
03:12:17,520 --> 03:12:18,200
Like...

4445
03:12:19,060 --> 03:12:20,680
Oh my god!

4446
03:12:20,880 --> 03:12:22,260
He does so much!

4447
03:12:22,420 --> 03:12:25,440
It's actually insane how much...

4448
03:12:26,610 --> 03:12:28,080
It's actually insane!

4449
03:12:29,880 --> 03:12:30,900
I...

4450
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:31,700
Oh!

4451
03:12:31,960 --> 03:12:33,320
Oh fuck!

4452
03:12:36,430 --> 03:12:38,720
Holy shit!

4453
03:12:39,080 --> 03:12:39,820
Okay.

4454
03:12:40,680 --> 03:12:41,920
That's scary.

4455
03:12:42,760 --> 03:12:44,380
That's actually scary.

4456
03:12:45,240 --> 03:12:46,260
Please!

4457
03:12:48,480 --> 03:12:49,500
Please!

4458
03:12:49,620 --> 03:12:50,480
Ah!

4459
03:12:52,540 --> 03:12:55,020
Oh my god!

4460
03:12:55,340 --> 03:12:57,660
Have fucking mercy!

4461
03:12:58,640 --> 03:13:00,800
Am I underleveled?

4462
03:13:01,980 --> 03:13:06,320
Oh my!

4463
03:13:06,440 --> 03:13:08,740
There's no way!

4464
03:13:09,960 --> 03:13:11,420
Oh my god, I need heal.

4465
03:13:11,660 --> 03:13:14,060
I need... I need a heal.

4466
03:13:14,680 --> 03:13:17,680
He's so tanky!

4467
03:13:18,920 --> 03:13:19,360
Boom!

4468
03:13:20,920 --> 03:13:21,360
Oh!

4469
03:13:21,580 --> 03:13:23,500
Maybe I just don't know his combos!

4470
03:13:26,060 --> 03:13:28,140
Maybe I just don't know his combos yet!

4471
03:13:28,500 --> 03:13:29,180
Maybe I just don't know his combos yet!

4472
03:13:29,180 --> 03:13:29,660
Maybe that's it!

4473
03:13:31,360 --> 03:13:32,800
Okay, that's... this is it.

4474
03:13:32,860 --> 03:13:33,840
I'm grabbing friends.

4475
03:13:34,360 --> 03:13:35,320
I'm grabbing friends.

4476
03:13:35,540 --> 03:13:36,760
You go gattle that, bro.

4477
03:13:36,840 --> 03:13:37,480
You guys go...

4478
03:13:37,480 --> 03:13:41,600
I swear to god, if my monkeys die, I... Monkeys, please!

4479
03:13:42,080 --> 03:13:43,400
He's right there, monkeys!

4480
03:13:43,660 --> 03:13:44,100
Please!

4481
03:13:44,500 --> 03:13:45,900
I need you!

4482
03:13:46,180 --> 03:13:46,540
I need you!

4483
03:13:47,880 --> 03:13:48,480
Oh!

4484
03:13:48,480 --> 03:13:49,340
Thank god!

4485
03:13:49,420 --> 03:13:49,740
Okay!

4486
03:13:50,220 --> 03:13:51,800
My one monkey now!

4487
03:13:53,360 --> 03:13:53,960
Alright!

4488
03:13:54,800 --> 03:13:56,660
I'm by myself after all that!

4489
03:13:57,460 --> 03:13:57,760
Okay!

4490
03:14:01,860 --> 03:14:03,060
Holy shit!

4491
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:03,520
Holy shit!

4492
03:14:03,520 --> 03:14:03,700
Holy shit!

4493
03:14:04,600 --> 03:14:06,520
Oh my god, I need a heal.

4494
03:14:06,760 --> 03:14:08,420
I have two heals left.

4495
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:12,500
Oh god!

4496
03:14:12,620 --> 03:14:13,540
Oh my god!

4497
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:13,840
Okay!

4498
03:14:15,340 --> 03:14:16,340
Come on!

4499
03:14:16,340 --> 03:14:17,540
My only hope!

4500
03:14:18,300 --> 03:14:19,900
My only hope!

4501
03:14:20,920 --> 03:14:21,560
My only hope!

4502
03:14:24,360 --> 03:14:25,160
Come on!

4503
03:14:25,460 --> 03:14:27,100
Come on yellow truck!

4504
03:14:35,060 --> 03:14:36,420
Get you off your feet!

4505
03:14:36,660 --> 03:14:38,760
I don't know that help, but...

4506
03:14:39,480 --> 03:14:41,100
What the fuck!

4507
03:14:41,440 --> 03:14:41,760
Okay.

4508
03:14:42,100 --> 03:14:43,040
I got slowed.

4509
03:14:43,180 --> 03:14:43,620
I got slowed.

4510
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:44,620
No.

4511
03:14:45,380 --> 03:14:45,700
No!

4512
03:14:47,680 --> 03:14:48,320
Please!

4513
03:14:48,320 --> 03:14:48,960
No!

4514
03:14:50,140 --> 03:14:51,780
I did a joke!

4515
03:14:55,240 --> 03:14:56,020
Please!

4516
03:14:56,460 --> 03:14:57,300
Please!

4517
03:14:57,700 --> 03:14:58,420
Oh my god!

4518
03:14:58,540 --> 03:14:59,680
Oh my god!

4519
03:14:59,960 --> 03:15:01,440
Oh my god!

4520
03:15:01,440 --> 03:15:01,600
Oh my god!

4521
03:15:02,800 --> 03:15:04,780
I'm almost like...

4522
03:15:04,780 --> 03:15:07,260
Oh thank fucking god!

4523
03:15:07,380 --> 03:15:08,580
I was so close!

4524
03:15:08,580 --> 03:15:09,740
I'm actually 1 HP!

4525
03:15:10,180 --> 03:15:12,300
Oh my god!

4526
03:15:12,880 --> 03:15:14,060
Thank god!

4527
03:15:15,260 --> 03:15:17,280
We actually did it!

4528
03:15:17,280 --> 03:15:20,360
We actually did it!

4529
03:15:20,440 --> 03:15:22,760
Oh that was way too close!

4530
03:15:23,160 --> 03:15:26,760
That was way too close!

4531
03:15:27,300 --> 03:15:29,160
I almost choked.

4532
03:15:29,640 --> 03:15:32,240
Oh I almost choked and got relatable.

4533
03:15:35,070 --> 03:15:37,160
Okay we can craft armor too.

4534
03:15:37,280 --> 03:15:38,000
Thank god.

4535
03:15:38,300 --> 03:15:40,680
It's not even better armor!

4536
03:15:41,060 --> 03:15:43,280
It's not even better!

4537
03:15:45,180 --> 03:15:46,360
That's fine.

4538
03:15:47,280 --> 03:15:47,700
We can rest.

4539
03:15:51,960 --> 03:15:53,200
Oh my god.

4540
03:15:53,960 --> 03:15:57,420
Alright time to tell the snake lady that...

4541
03:15:58,320 --> 03:15:58,840
Wait.

4542
03:15:58,980 --> 03:16:00,260
Alright so I killed him.

4543
03:16:01,380 --> 03:16:06,480
Now this is where we let her know this boss is skippable and missable the whole time but he's fun right?

4544
03:16:06,620 --> 03:16:08,720
Just below yellow lone...

4545
03:16:08,720 --> 03:16:10,460
Wait but I killed him in 2 tries.

4546
03:16:11,140 --> 03:16:12,620
John what do you mean?

4547
03:16:12,980 --> 03:16:14,880
I killed him in 2 tries!

4548
03:16:15,120 --> 03:16:17,380
Thank you for the super chat content!

4549
03:16:17,620 --> 03:16:17,980
Thank you!

4550
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:18,640
Thank you!

4551
03:16:19,960 --> 03:16:21,160
Oh 3 tries.

4552
03:16:21,540 --> 03:16:21,960
Okay.

4553
03:16:23,580 --> 03:16:24,960
Where's the chest?

4554
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:28,700
I guess that's why he's just below.

4555
03:16:28,980 --> 03:16:29,360
Right?

4556
03:16:32,120 --> 03:16:32,700
Alright.

4557
03:16:33,160 --> 03:16:34,140
This is it.

4558
03:16:36,180 --> 03:16:37,060
Chest time.

4559
03:16:41,370 --> 03:16:41,950
Alright.

4560
03:16:43,210 --> 03:16:45,350
Holy shit we got rid of him.

4561
03:16:45,610 --> 03:16:48,910
I have to find her remains right?

4562
03:16:49,650 --> 03:16:50,230
The...

4563
03:16:51,650 --> 03:16:52,250
husband remains?

4564
03:16:52,610 --> 03:16:52,910
Right?

4565
03:16:53,070 --> 03:16:54,670
Or can I just talk to the snake now?

4566
03:16:57,530 --> 03:16:59,330
I can't believe you.

4567
03:16:59,410 --> 03:17:00,830
This was an intervention guys.

4568
03:17:08,930 --> 03:17:10,410
Alright let's see.

4569
03:17:10,750 --> 03:17:11,330
Wait where's this?

4570
03:17:14,730 --> 03:17:16,710
Mal was just depressed.

4571
03:17:17,510 --> 03:17:18,910
I beat him.

4572
03:17:19,090 --> 03:17:20,650
He was just trying to drink.

4573
03:17:20,650 --> 03:17:25,210
I beat up an alcoholic while he was just trying to be depressed.

4574
03:17:25,790 --> 03:17:26,910
Oh no.

4575
03:17:27,290 --> 03:17:29,410
Guys please don't cancel me on twitter.

4576
03:17:29,610 --> 03:17:30,810
Like I didn't.

4577
03:17:30,810 --> 03:17:30,990
No.

4578
03:17:34,430 --> 03:17:38,510
Guys I didn't mean to beat up a depressed person.

4579
03:17:39,010 --> 03:17:42,130
Like he committed war crimes guys.

4580
03:17:42,310 --> 03:17:43,810
It doesn't exempt him.

4581
03:17:44,210 --> 03:17:46,830
He still committed war crimes.

4582
03:17:47,550 --> 03:17:48,230
Chat.

4583
03:17:49,450 --> 03:17:51,250
You're defending a war criminal.

4584
03:17:54,850 --> 03:17:56,330
Alright let's see.

4585
03:17:57,770 --> 03:17:58,810
So lost.

4586
03:18:02,970 --> 03:18:04,750
Will I ever not be lost?

4587
03:18:06,630 --> 03:18:07,910
Oh there's another thing.

4588
03:18:08,050 --> 03:18:08,890
Oh there's a shrine here.

4589
03:18:11,410 --> 03:18:11,970
Alright.

4590
03:18:12,550 --> 03:18:13,850
I gotta go this way.

4591
03:18:15,330 --> 03:18:15,890
Hello.

4592
03:18:16,070 --> 03:18:17,110
Your friend's dead.

4593
03:18:19,030 --> 03:18:20,090
I love how they.

4594
03:18:20,170 --> 03:18:21,230
I love how like one.

4595
03:18:21,310 --> 03:18:23,930
The other guy just watches his friend get beat up.

4596
03:18:24,430 --> 03:18:25,270
Every time.

4597
03:18:26,950 --> 03:18:28,890
I assume I crossed this bridge.

4598
03:18:33,940 --> 03:18:34,460
Alright.

4599
03:18:34,780 --> 03:18:35,600
Rest time.

4600
03:18:39,900 --> 03:18:41,520
I guess I go this way.

4601
03:18:41,600 --> 03:18:43,540
There's like another pathway up here.

4602
03:18:44,560 --> 03:18:45,540
Which I assumed.

4603
03:18:45,580 --> 03:18:46,880
There's so many optional areas.

4604
03:18:47,540 --> 03:18:49,420
Which is the correct optional.

4605
03:18:52,560 --> 03:18:55,300
I hate being forced to make decisions.

4606
03:18:55,960 --> 03:18:56,840
I hate being forced to make decisions.

4607
03:18:56,840 --> 03:18:57,540
It's so difficult.

4608
03:18:58,720 --> 03:19:00,740
I'm so bad at making decisions.

4609
03:19:01,520 --> 03:19:01,740
I'm so bad at making decisions.

4610
03:19:03,680 --> 03:19:05,400
I'm trying to beat up a tree again.

4611
03:19:05,740 --> 03:19:06,020
I'm trying to beat up a tree again.

4612
03:19:06,160 --> 03:19:08,040
I beat up his like his dad.

4613
03:19:08,220 --> 03:19:08,920
So like it's fine.

4614
03:19:09,120 --> 03:19:09,840
I can do it again.

4615
03:19:11,520 --> 03:19:12,240
Oh god.

4616
03:19:13,100 --> 03:19:14,900
Why are they so tanky?

4617
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:18,120
Oh yeah.

4618
03:19:18,240 --> 03:19:18,980
I don't have energy.

4619
03:19:19,180 --> 03:19:19,540
That's why.

4620
03:19:22,420 --> 03:19:23,640
I realized like.

4621
03:19:23,720 --> 03:19:24,900
I have zero stamina.

4622
03:19:25,140 --> 03:19:26,160
He's so tall.

4623
03:19:26,240 --> 03:19:27,840
I was looking up at his legs.

4624
03:19:29,760 --> 03:19:31,400
Doki his eyes are up there.

4625
03:19:33,820 --> 03:19:35,120
Yeah we go this way.

4626
03:19:35,360 --> 03:19:35,960
Cause there's a.

4627
03:19:38,740 --> 03:19:40,260
There's like a path up here.

4628
03:19:40,420 --> 03:19:40,960
I think.

4629
03:19:41,680 --> 03:19:42,200
Yeah.

4630
03:19:43,080 --> 03:19:44,000
Nice absorb.

4631
03:19:46,840 --> 03:19:48,020
If you do your.

4632
03:19:48,040 --> 03:19:48,740
croquis intro.

4633
03:19:48,820 --> 03:19:50,800
You get bonus output in your monkey.

4634
03:19:51,960 --> 03:19:53,140
Thank you for the super chat.

4635
03:19:53,260 --> 03:19:53,600
Thank you.

4636
03:19:54,300 --> 03:19:55,700
Oh hey a bridge.

4637
03:19:56,580 --> 03:19:57,880
Is this optional?

4638
03:19:59,040 --> 03:20:00,960
This has to be an optional area.

4639
03:20:01,220 --> 03:20:01,800
There's no way.

4640
03:20:04,660 --> 03:20:05,780
Thank you for your.

4641
03:20:05,780 --> 03:20:07,400
Very first super chat too.

4642
03:20:07,860 --> 03:20:08,460
Please.

4643
03:20:10,060 --> 03:20:10,660
Please.

4644
03:20:10,660 --> 03:20:12,080
Oh my god.

4645
03:20:12,140 --> 03:20:13,120
I'm fucking gonna.

4646
03:20:13,480 --> 03:20:15,940
I'm gonna go nuclear.

4647
03:20:16,360 --> 03:20:16,860
I'm gonna.

4648
03:20:20,320 --> 03:20:20,920
Alright.

4649
03:20:21,960 --> 03:20:22,120
Where am I?

4650
03:20:25,160 --> 03:20:26,560
We'll turn this car around.

4651
03:20:26,680 --> 03:20:27,740
I swear to fucking god.

4652
03:20:28,960 --> 03:20:30,020
Is this way?

4653
03:20:33,360 --> 03:20:34,480
Oh meditation.

4654
03:20:36,380 --> 03:20:36,940
Oh.

4655
03:20:37,860 --> 03:20:38,880
Meditation time.

4656
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:40,900
Oh my god.

4657
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:41,940
I can't.

4658
03:20:43,700 --> 03:20:45,460
I'm meditating so hard.

4659
03:20:45,560 --> 03:20:46,240
That my friend.

4660
03:20:46,840 --> 03:20:48,160
It's just too beautiful.

4661
03:20:48,460 --> 03:20:50,140
This place is too beautiful.

4662
03:20:55,840 --> 03:20:57,280
It's too beautiful.

4663
03:20:57,660 --> 03:20:58,180
Like.

4664
03:20:59,300 --> 03:20:59,900
It's too beautiful.

4665
03:20:59,900 --> 03:21:01,240
This is why I'm killing all the trees.

4666
03:21:01,540 --> 03:21:02,820
So I can make it less beautiful.

4667
03:21:05,060 --> 03:21:06,180
I'm just trying.

4668
03:21:06,200 --> 03:21:08,220
Trying to make it less beautiful guy.

4669
03:21:10,980 --> 03:21:13,000
Meditate down to 20 frames.

4670
03:21:15,300 --> 03:21:15,900
Okay.

4671
03:21:16,200 --> 03:21:16,780
Oh, I can.

4672
03:21:16,780 --> 03:21:18,360
Are we going to upgrade?

4673
03:21:19,220 --> 03:21:20,400
Alright, let's see.

4674
03:21:20,800 --> 03:21:26,280
I guess I can put more into... I want to get more in critical hit.

4675
03:21:27,840 --> 03:21:28,520
Yeah.

4676
03:21:29,920 --> 03:21:31,800
What can I upgrade?

4677
03:21:35,880 --> 03:21:37,800
Damage reduction during light attack?

4678
03:21:37,960 --> 03:21:38,940
Fuck yeah, let's go.

4679
03:21:41,020 --> 03:21:42,020
Where do I go?

4680
03:21:42,660 --> 03:21:43,880
I guess down?

4681
03:21:44,280 --> 03:21:46,200
What goes down?

4682
03:21:46,780 --> 03:21:47,620
Let's go up.

4683
03:21:50,760 --> 03:21:52,220
Alright, down we go.

4684
03:21:54,700 --> 03:21:58,300
Oh, I guess that was like an optional area for the meditation.

4685
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:01,560
Okay, now I don't know where I am anymore.

4686
03:22:03,600 --> 03:22:05,200
Do I ever know?

4687
03:22:05,920 --> 03:22:08,180
No, now I don't know where I am.

4688
03:22:10,300 --> 03:22:11,280
Oh, left!

4689
03:22:11,440 --> 03:22:12,260
Okay, I know.

4690
03:22:12,340 --> 03:22:14,040
I recognize that tree.

4691
03:22:14,920 --> 03:22:16,360
I recognize that temple.

4692
03:22:17,620 --> 03:22:18,060
Left.

4693
03:22:18,060 --> 03:22:20,280
And then we go right and then there's other stuff.

4694
03:22:21,680 --> 03:22:22,120
Tommy!

4695
03:22:22,280 --> 03:22:23,200
Thank you for the super chat.

4696
03:22:23,320 --> 03:22:24,000
Thank you, thank you.

4697
03:22:24,140 --> 03:22:25,540
I've been feeling down lately.

4698
03:22:25,780 --> 03:22:28,040
I just want to say thanks for your streams.

4699
03:22:28,140 --> 03:22:29,220
Never fails to brighten my day.

4700
03:22:29,320 --> 03:22:30,040
Thank you for the super chat.

4701
03:22:30,100 --> 03:22:30,840
Thank you, thank you.

4702
03:22:30,860 --> 03:22:33,820
I'm glad to brighten your day today with Wukong.

4703
03:22:35,300 --> 03:22:35,960
I do.

4704
03:22:36,660 --> 03:22:37,380
I do.

4705
03:22:37,480 --> 03:22:43,640
When you guys get super annoyed by video games giving you instructions and tips, they're doing it for me.

4706
03:22:43,780 --> 03:22:45,340
They're Doki-proofing the game.

4707
03:22:46,080 --> 03:22:48,140
I'm the reason why games are like that.

4708
03:22:48,220 --> 03:22:48,640
You're welcome.

4709
03:22:49,400 --> 03:22:51,020
It was you!

4710
03:22:52,480 --> 03:22:54,620
I am the target audience.

4711
03:23:01,240 --> 03:23:04,040
The reason for the yellow paint.

4712
03:23:06,540 --> 03:23:07,280
Oh, hey.

4713
03:23:07,720 --> 03:23:09,820
Is he playing music?

4714
03:23:10,500 --> 03:23:11,100
Hello!

4715
03:23:12,040 --> 03:23:14,460
A music player can't be a bad guy, right?

4716
03:23:20,150 --> 03:23:20,780
Yeah!

4717
03:23:20,860 --> 03:23:21,520
I knew it!

4718
03:23:43,640 --> 03:23:46,160
Is this...

4719
03:23:47,980 --> 03:23:49,460
Is this Drupal guy?

4720
03:23:50,220 --> 03:23:51,540
Or the dad?

4721
03:23:51,660 --> 03:23:52,200
Or the husband?

4722
03:23:57,100 --> 03:23:59,140
Is that the dead husband?

4723
03:23:59,920 --> 03:24:02,000
My fellow disciple is hungry for...

4724
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:02,300
Wait!

4725
03:24:02,400 --> 03:24:03,040
Are you the...

4726
03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:04,260
Are you the master?

4727
03:24:13,060 --> 03:24:13,660
No.

4728
03:24:13,860 --> 03:24:15,180
Okay, he's just a random guy.

4729
03:24:17,540 --> 03:24:19,160
Okay, he's just a random guy.

4730
03:24:20,740 --> 03:24:21,700
Okay, he's just a random guy.

4731
03:24:21,700 --> 03:24:22,360
Okay, you were just nobody.

4732
03:24:22,900 --> 03:24:23,040
Okay, you were just nobody.

4733
03:24:23,360 --> 03:24:24,420
Okay, you were just nobody.

4734
03:24:25,140 --> 03:24:26,340
They're eggs on...

4735
03:24:26,340 --> 03:24:27,080
They're eggs on...

4736
03:24:27,080 --> 03:24:27,100
Ah!

4737
03:24:28,340 --> 03:24:30,040
I'm going to find a way to solve this problem.

4738
03:24:30,760 --> 03:24:34,040
Little gentleman, do you have any senior brothers?

4739
03:24:35,060 --> 03:24:36,020
No, no.

4740
03:24:36,740 --> 03:24:39,340
I think they like to play around in the manor.

4741
03:24:39,860 --> 03:24:40,840
Can you see around?

4742
03:24:42,280 --> 03:24:43,320
So I just need to...

4743
03:24:44,720 --> 03:24:46,140
I just need to bring him here.

4744
03:24:46,140 --> 03:24:46,740
I'm giving him the eggs.

4745
03:24:46,960 --> 03:24:48,260
What are you gonna do with the eggs?

4746
03:24:48,360 --> 03:24:49,280
Bro, are you a freak?

4747
03:24:50,660 --> 03:24:53,480
What the fuck are you gonna do with... bro, that's fucking weird, bro.

4748
03:24:56,560 --> 03:24:57,600
Bro, are you gonna eat it?

4749
03:24:57,620 --> 03:24:58,940
Like, what the fuck are you gonna do with those eggs?

4750
03:24:58,980 --> 03:25:00,040
That's fucking weird, man.

4751
03:25:01,480 --> 03:25:03,960
Bro, that's fucking weird.

4752
03:25:08,800 --> 03:25:11,380
What I'm saying is that, that's fucking weird.

4753
03:25:12,060 --> 03:25:13,620
Like, what is he gonna do with those eggs?

4754
03:25:16,620 --> 03:25:17,640
Alright, nice.

4755
03:25:17,900 --> 03:25:19,000
I got some gold.

4756
03:25:19,120 --> 03:25:20,440
I robbed this man's wallet.

4757
03:25:21,960 --> 03:25:23,200
Okay, chest time.

4758
03:25:27,800 --> 03:25:28,360
Nice.

4759
03:25:28,940 --> 03:25:32,060
See guys, this is why I don't need iron cold leaves.

4760
03:25:32,560 --> 03:25:35,100
I got more iron cold leaves again.

4761
03:25:37,380 --> 03:25:40,360
Okay, I guess I'll harvest this for now.

4762
03:25:44,210 --> 03:25:44,770
Okay.

4763
03:25:45,910 --> 03:25:46,770
Go up.

4764
03:25:48,630 --> 03:25:49,690
Up I go.

4765
03:25:50,350 --> 03:25:51,370
Up I go.

4766
03:25:52,670 --> 03:25:53,290
Hello?

4767
03:25:54,310 --> 03:25:54,930
Hello.

4768
03:25:57,370 --> 03:26:01,870
I thought, I thought the snake, the snake said there's gonna be like, bugs.

4769
03:26:02,790 --> 03:26:04,710
It's literally just people.

4770
03:26:05,710 --> 03:26:08,490
Unless people were the real bugs all along.

4771
03:26:10,110 --> 03:26:10,730
Okay.

4772
03:26:11,690 --> 03:26:12,650
Oh no.

4773
03:26:13,070 --> 03:26:15,430
There's forward, left, I'm gonna go right.

4774
03:26:16,630 --> 03:26:17,770
I'm gonna go right.

4775
03:26:22,970 --> 03:26:23,550
I'm gonna go right.

4776
03:26:23,550 --> 03:26:23,890
This way.

4777
03:26:28,750 --> 03:26:30,870
This looks like the village from earlier.

4778
03:26:30,970 --> 03:26:31,770
From the beginning.

4779
03:26:32,550 --> 03:26:33,610
With the bridge?

4780
03:26:34,350 --> 03:26:35,710
It looks so similar.

4781
03:26:38,230 --> 03:26:39,490
Unless it is.

4782
03:26:47,420 --> 03:26:48,400
Look for it.

4783
03:26:48,420 --> 03:26:48,540
Oh.

4784
03:26:48,840 --> 03:26:49,840
Wait, it's the same.

4785
03:26:50,060 --> 03:26:51,960
It's like, looks so similar.

4786
03:26:51,960 --> 03:26:52,300
Oh, there's a killer.

4787
03:26:54,140 --> 03:26:55,900
Oh my god, am I getting it?

4788
03:27:01,400 --> 03:27:02,260
What is this?

4789
03:27:04,260 --> 03:27:05,360
Oh, there's spiders.

4790
03:27:05,780 --> 03:27:06,240
Whoa!

4791
03:27:10,180 --> 03:27:12,440
Okay, we gotta get rid of the spider guy.

4792
03:27:13,600 --> 03:27:15,140
Wait, do you have eggs inside you?

4793
03:27:15,760 --> 03:27:16,920
Bro, do you have some eggs?

4794
03:27:17,180 --> 03:27:18,280
Bro, he has no eggs!

4795
03:27:23,160 --> 03:27:24,760
Where the fuck are your eggs?

4796
03:27:25,820 --> 03:27:27,220
Bro, I was given a mission!

4797
03:27:32,300 --> 03:27:33,800
Oh, only the humans?

4798
03:27:34,240 --> 03:27:35,820
Oh, okay, I should go back then.

4799
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:37,860
I'll go back.

4800
03:27:40,640 --> 03:27:43,520
I thought the spiders had them too, cause they're already...

4801
03:27:43,520 --> 03:27:46,360
I guess cause the eggs haven't hatched inside them.

4802
03:27:47,600 --> 03:27:49,120
Alright, bro, it's harvest time.

4803
03:27:50,820 --> 03:27:52,040
It's harvest season.

4804
03:27:52,180 --> 03:27:53,700
Wait, how do I get across?

4805
03:27:55,080 --> 03:27:56,320
Okay, I'll just go left.

4806
03:27:56,620 --> 03:27:58,980
I thought I could go front, but I guess not.

4807
03:27:59,360 --> 03:28:00,260
Is there anything here?

4808
03:28:04,240 --> 03:28:06,000
Bro, do you have eggs inside you?

4809
03:28:07,620 --> 03:28:08,500
Bro, can I...

4810
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:09,960
Can I see?

4811
03:28:10,820 --> 03:28:11,700
I gotta know.

4812
03:28:13,040 --> 03:28:14,480
You got them eggs inside you?

4813
03:28:16,320 --> 03:28:17,740
He doesn't have no eggs!

4814
03:28:19,860 --> 03:28:21,520
Where the fuck are the eggs?

4815
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:23,120
How am I supposed to harvest them?

4816
03:28:24,100 --> 03:28:27,760
Okay, you can't just ask him if he got eggs inside him.

4817
03:28:28,560 --> 03:28:29,360
Oh, shit!

4818
03:28:29,420 --> 03:28:29,700
Shit!

4819
03:28:31,400 --> 03:28:32,320
Okay, is that...

4820
03:28:33,660 --> 03:28:36,200
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

4821
03:28:38,140 --> 03:28:41,940
Oh no, I think I might die from... I think I might die from the poison.

4822
03:28:43,920 --> 03:28:46,100
I'm just gonna get this guy out of the way.

4823
03:28:48,380 --> 03:28:49,480
Can't believe it!

4824
03:28:49,520 --> 03:28:52,500
A chest in the middle and it was a trap all along?

4825
03:28:53,760 --> 03:28:54,420
Could they?

4826
03:28:54,500 --> 03:28:55,820
There's no integrity anymore.

4827
03:28:59,420 --> 03:29:00,260
Nice, more gold.

4828
03:29:01,140 --> 03:29:02,480
Where is the integrity?

4829
03:29:07,090 --> 03:29:08,590
Alright, this way.

4830
03:29:11,550 --> 03:29:13,050
Is there anything here?

4831
03:29:15,270 --> 03:29:16,610
So many webs.

4832
03:29:16,830 --> 03:29:16,950
Oh!

4833
03:29:17,470 --> 03:29:18,550
Oh, there's a shrine!

4834
03:29:19,530 --> 03:29:20,810
There's a shrine near me!

4835
03:29:20,970 --> 03:29:21,370
Nice!

4836
03:29:27,060 --> 03:29:29,760
Yo, did you fuck a spider and she laid eggs in you?

4837
03:29:33,750 --> 03:29:34,250
Like...

4838
03:29:34,250 --> 03:29:35,910
Is this T... Is that TMI?

4839
03:29:37,830 --> 03:29:40,430
Bro, I don't know if it's TMI, but...

4840
03:29:44,610 --> 03:29:46,110
Alright, maybe he has them.

4841
03:29:49,430 --> 03:29:50,790
Bro, do you got eggs?

4842
03:29:51,670 --> 03:29:52,150
You?

4843
03:29:53,070 --> 03:29:53,550
No!

4844
03:29:55,190 --> 03:29:56,990
All they have is willpower!

4845
03:29:57,270 --> 03:29:59,350
What am I gonna do with willpower?

4846
03:30:01,110 --> 03:30:02,150
Oh, is that up?

4847
03:30:03,290 --> 03:30:04,750
Okay, don't go up.

4848
03:30:04,910 --> 03:30:06,150
Okay, I go down.

4849
03:30:08,110 --> 03:30:09,470
I guess that's up.

4850
03:30:10,950 --> 03:30:12,150
Is this also up?

4851
03:30:13,990 --> 03:30:15,210
I don't think this counts, right?

4852
03:30:19,010 --> 03:30:20,030
Alright, what about you?

4853
03:30:20,390 --> 03:30:21,390
Sir, do you have any?

4854
03:30:22,490 --> 03:30:24,550
God damn it, they only have willpower!

4855
03:30:27,390 --> 03:30:29,830
What am I gonna do with willpower?

4856
03:30:32,950 --> 03:30:33,630
Okay, nice.

4857
03:30:33,670 --> 03:30:35,070
I have to get rid of the spider too.

4858
03:30:36,490 --> 03:30:37,350
Still no eggs!

4859
03:30:41,330 --> 03:30:43,090
Bro, that man lies to me!

4860
03:30:43,950 --> 03:30:47,650
He's like, my men, they're gonna have some eggs in them.

4861
03:30:49,390 --> 03:30:50,350
Fucking liar!

4862
03:30:53,710 --> 03:30:54,830
They're eggless!

4863
03:30:55,850 --> 03:30:58,010
That means they didn't get lucky!

4864
03:31:02,130 --> 03:31:04,870
They didn't get lucky, those poor men!

4865
03:31:06,710 --> 03:31:10,590
Like, what's the point of letting the spiders here if they didn't get so lucky?

4866
03:31:12,030 --> 03:31:12,590
Thank you!

4867
03:31:12,630 --> 03:31:12,990
Thank you!

4868
03:31:13,130 --> 03:31:13,910
Thank you!

4869
03:31:16,150 --> 03:31:17,270
The fate...

4870
03:31:18,230 --> 03:31:19,010
The fuck?

4871
03:31:19,130 --> 03:31:19,330
What?

4872
03:31:19,390 --> 03:31:20,030
No spider?

4873
03:31:20,150 --> 03:31:21,490
No spider wife?

4874
03:31:22,610 --> 03:31:23,570
Those poor guys.

4875
03:31:24,130 --> 03:31:26,350
Didn't even score a spider wife.

4876
03:31:30,480 --> 03:31:31,280
That already farmed?

4877
03:31:31,340 --> 03:31:31,980
Didn't even...

4878
03:31:31,980 --> 03:31:34,060
Maybe I got it already and I didn't notice.

4879
03:31:35,800 --> 03:31:38,460
No, you guys would have yelled at me if I did.

4880
03:31:40,240 --> 03:31:44,840
You guys would 100% yell at me and be like, you already got it, Toki!

4881
03:31:44,900 --> 03:31:45,880
Why are you still farming?

4882
03:31:48,720 --> 03:31:49,540
Okay, reload.

4883
03:31:52,400 --> 03:31:53,280
Okay, maybe...

4884
03:31:55,220 --> 03:31:56,460
Do I go back up here?

4885
03:31:56,740 --> 03:31:57,600
Can I go up here?

4886
03:31:58,720 --> 03:31:59,620
Wait, not up here.

4887
03:31:59,700 --> 03:32:01,620
I'm quite lost in this confined area.

4888
03:32:03,260 --> 03:32:03,700
Here.

4889
03:32:04,060 --> 03:32:05,340
Am I allowed to go up here?

4890
03:32:05,460 --> 03:32:06,040
Is there anything here?

4891
03:32:09,860 --> 03:32:10,300
Whoa!

4892
03:32:11,240 --> 03:32:12,140
That scared me.

4893
03:32:12,680 --> 03:32:13,460
Oh my god!

4894
03:32:13,500 --> 03:32:13,680
Okay!

4895
03:32:13,800 --> 03:32:14,400
Oh, my camera!

4896
03:32:14,960 --> 03:32:16,480
My camera fucked up!

4897
03:32:18,340 --> 03:32:18,780
Will.

4898
03:32:18,780 --> 03:32:19,940
So willpower!

4899
03:32:20,580 --> 03:32:22,260
Did none of you get lucky?

4900
03:32:24,940 --> 03:32:26,500
Are you all eggless?

4901
03:32:27,800 --> 03:32:28,780
That's sad, bro.

4902
03:32:29,500 --> 03:32:30,400
That's so sad.

4903
03:32:32,020 --> 03:32:34,040
It's complete RNG, bro.

4904
03:32:34,100 --> 03:32:35,500
Okay, that says a lot about me.

4905
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:38,920
That says a lot about me.

4906
03:32:39,700 --> 03:32:42,220
It's complete RNG.

4907
03:32:42,580 --> 03:32:43,840
Holy shit.

4908
03:32:44,300 --> 03:32:45,080
Why?

4909
03:32:48,680 --> 03:32:49,460
Alright.

4910
03:32:49,660 --> 03:32:50,540
Still none.

4911
03:32:51,180 --> 03:32:52,480
Still no egg.

4912
03:32:53,660 --> 03:32:54,820
Eggless behavior.

4913
03:32:56,940 --> 03:32:58,380
I guess...

4914
03:32:58,380 --> 03:33:01,320
Oh my god, time to rest again.

4915
03:33:01,660 --> 03:33:02,800
They were not chosen.

4916
03:33:03,720 --> 03:33:09,440
They sadly didn't get chosen by the one million spider women.

4917
03:33:09,920 --> 03:33:14,420
I think the best part is that there was not...

4918
03:33:14,420 --> 03:33:17,460
That granny had so many kids.

4919
03:33:17,960 --> 03:33:21,360
And I still haven't found a single one!

4920
03:33:22,260 --> 03:33:23,820
I don't understand!

4921
03:33:26,540 --> 03:33:28,620
How is that possible?

4922
03:33:30,600 --> 03:33:32,620
How is that possible?

4923
03:33:32,620 --> 03:33:33,860
There's so many!

4924
03:33:36,900 --> 03:33:37,520
There's so many!

4925
03:33:37,520 --> 03:33:37,980
Okay.

4926
03:33:38,460 --> 03:33:42,180
I'll just find these same three people over and over again till I find one.

4927
03:33:42,660 --> 03:33:43,900
I can't be bothered.

4928
03:33:44,200 --> 03:33:45,140
I can't!

4929
03:33:48,160 --> 03:33:48,640
Alright.

4930
03:33:55,300 --> 03:33:56,340
Oh my god.

4931
03:33:56,380 --> 03:33:56,640
Okay.

4932
03:33:57,300 --> 03:33:58,000
Here we go.

4933
03:33:59,240 --> 03:34:00,060
Off we go.

4934
03:34:00,140 --> 03:34:00,580
You know what?

4935
03:34:00,740 --> 03:34:02,180
Since I'm gonna be here for a bit.

4936
03:34:03,320 --> 03:34:04,580
Is it overkill?

4937
03:34:04,620 --> 03:34:04,860
Yes.

4938
03:34:05,340 --> 03:34:08,480
But like you don't understand, I'm desperate here right now.

4939
03:34:08,720 --> 03:34:10,080
I'm so desperate.

4940
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:13,960
Is that it?

4941
03:34:14,020 --> 03:34:15,720
No, it's just level up.

4942
03:34:15,760 --> 03:34:17,440
What am I gonna do with a level up?

4943
03:34:17,840 --> 03:34:19,640
What am I gonna do?

4944
03:34:24,140 --> 03:34:25,160
Still will.

4945
03:34:25,360 --> 03:34:27,880
It's still willpower.

4946
03:34:30,120 --> 03:34:33,100
Why did they not impregnate these men?

4947
03:34:33,540 --> 03:34:33,700
No!

4948
03:34:35,100 --> 03:34:35,940
Okay.

4949
03:34:38,280 --> 03:34:39,120
Alright.

4950
03:34:39,260 --> 03:34:40,220
Here we go.

4951
03:34:41,380 --> 03:34:42,500
There we go.

4952
03:34:44,200 --> 03:34:45,040
Alright.

4953
03:34:46,220 --> 03:34:47,380
Is that it?

4954
03:34:48,400 --> 03:34:49,500
Violent hell?

4955
03:34:49,680 --> 03:34:50,580
Is that it?

4956
03:34:51,660 --> 03:34:52,820
Is that what?

4957
03:34:52,940 --> 03:34:53,920
There it is!

4958
03:34:54,420 --> 03:34:56,180
He got chosen!

4959
03:34:57,140 --> 03:34:59,540
He got chosen!

4960
03:35:00,440 --> 03:35:01,280
Congratulations!

4961
03:35:01,620 --> 03:35:02,240
Congratulations!

4962
03:35:03,540 --> 03:35:05,540
You got chosen!

4963
03:35:06,080 --> 03:35:07,600
Oh my god.

4964
03:35:07,640 --> 03:35:08,140
Congratulations.

4965
03:35:08,380 --> 03:35:10,220
You got impregnated.

4966
03:35:10,500 --> 03:35:11,960
Oh my god.

4967
03:35:13,160 --> 03:35:15,380
Deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

4968
03:35:15,520 --> 03:35:15,840
Thank you.

4969
03:35:16,120 --> 03:35:18,540
You got impregnated.

4970
03:35:18,540 --> 03:35:19,780
Thank fucking god.

4971
03:35:24,180 --> 03:35:26,000
Oh my god.

4972
03:35:27,340 --> 03:35:28,120
Thank god.

4973
03:35:28,680 --> 03:35:29,940
Good for him.

4974
03:35:33,080 --> 03:35:33,980
Good for him.

4975
03:35:34,360 --> 03:35:38,160
Good for him.

4976
03:35:38,160 --> 03:35:38,560
Alright.

4977
03:35:38,740 --> 03:35:39,160
Nice.

4978
03:35:39,580 --> 03:35:39,740
Alright.

4979
03:35:39,740 --> 03:35:39,740
Nice.

4980
03:35:41,280 --> 03:35:42,040
Here we go.

4981
03:35:42,040 --> 03:35:42,680
I got the egg.

4982
03:35:43,920 --> 03:35:45,140
It wasn't even called an egg.

4983
03:35:45,180 --> 03:35:46,420
It was called Violent Hell.

4984
03:35:46,600 --> 03:35:48,280
I guess because her name is Violet.

4985
03:35:49,100 --> 03:35:49,520
Oh!

4986
03:35:50,280 --> 03:35:50,300
Oh!

4987
03:35:51,020 --> 03:35:51,440
Oh!

4988
03:35:54,100 --> 03:35:54,520
Oh!

4989
03:35:54,520 --> 03:35:58,380
I guess because she was living up with ghosts, I had to go back.

4990
03:35:58,640 --> 03:35:59,320
I had to go back to Buddha Temple.

4991
03:36:05,450 --> 03:36:06,090
What?

4992
03:36:06,430 --> 03:36:07,490
Is he evil?

4993
03:36:11,310 --> 03:36:11,950
Wait!

4994
03:36:18,430 --> 03:36:18,750
What?

4995
03:36:21,270 --> 03:36:22,530
Wait, you're evil?

4996
03:36:24,350 --> 03:36:26,530
But I gave you the egg!

4997
03:36:26,530 --> 03:36:26,970
Yeah!

4998
03:36:28,290 --> 03:36:29,790
Why are you evil?

4999
03:36:32,150 --> 03:36:34,310
I gave you what you wanted!

5000
03:36:35,210 --> 03:36:36,590
I know what I mean!

5001
03:36:37,050 --> 03:36:37,730
Wow!

5002
03:36:38,590 --> 03:36:41,650
The guy that looked evil was actually evil!

5003
03:36:44,490 --> 03:36:47,410
He did ask nicely, Doki.

5004
03:36:50,270 --> 03:36:51,610
I can't believe...

5005
03:36:51,610 --> 03:36:53,850
That's why he's gonna break stereotypes, guys!

5006
03:36:54,050 --> 03:36:56,510
I thought he was gonna break the stereotype.

5007
03:36:56,510 --> 03:37:00,950
I was like, the man that looks evil cannot possibly be evil.

5008
03:37:02,490 --> 03:37:03,730
That's shocking.

5009
03:37:05,590 --> 03:37:08,430
Always judge a book by its cover.

5010
03:37:08,670 --> 03:37:11,630
I was trying to not judge a book by its cover!

5011
03:37:11,750 --> 03:37:13,470
I was trying to be open-minded here!

5012
03:37:14,030 --> 03:37:19,070
I wanted to be open-minded!

5013
03:37:20,390 --> 03:37:21,310
Wait, what?

5014
03:37:24,490 --> 03:37:25,750
Did my mouse die?

5015
03:37:26,510 --> 03:37:27,190
Sorry!

5016
03:37:27,770 --> 03:37:31,730
I didn't move because I was like, why couldn't I hit?

5017
03:37:32,170 --> 03:37:34,170
I thought my mouse died.

5018
03:37:34,410 --> 03:37:36,250
So I looked at him.

5019
03:37:45,510 --> 03:37:47,030
Wait, phase two?

5020
03:37:51,610 --> 03:37:52,330
Metamorphosis?

5021
03:37:55,110 --> 03:37:56,590
Did she just...

5022
03:37:56,590 --> 03:37:57,930
How did...

5023
03:38:00,610 --> 03:38:01,770
Oh, shit!

5024
03:38:02,730 --> 03:38:05,690
Would you love me if I was a worm?

5025
03:38:09,270 --> 03:38:10,710
Oh, no!

5026
03:38:10,910 --> 03:38:12,770
No, not the worm question!

5027
03:38:13,270 --> 03:38:14,790
Not the worm question!

5028
03:38:17,350 --> 03:38:17,710
No!

5029
03:38:19,350 --> 03:38:21,130
Now he becomes worm.

5030
03:38:22,150 --> 03:38:23,370
He's gonna...

5031
03:38:23,370 --> 03:38:24,670
What the fuck is he doing?

5032
03:38:25,330 --> 03:38:26,610
That's what he's doing!

5033
03:38:26,610 --> 03:38:28,410
Okay, I was so confused there.

5034
03:38:28,650 --> 03:38:30,130
I was like, what is that?

5035
03:38:31,610 --> 03:38:32,250
Oh, no.

5036
03:38:32,330 --> 03:38:33,610
He's asking the question.

5037
03:38:33,790 --> 03:38:34,930
Guys, what do I say?

5038
03:38:35,830 --> 03:38:37,290
What do I say, guys?

5039
03:38:37,610 --> 03:38:38,370
I don't know.

5040
03:38:38,490 --> 03:38:39,270
Like, look at him.

5041
03:38:45,370 --> 03:38:46,170
Oh, god.

5042
03:38:46,350 --> 03:38:46,690
Whoa!

5043
03:38:46,970 --> 03:38:48,830
Okay, I'm gonna heal for real now.

5044
03:38:50,830 --> 03:38:51,230
Nice.

5045
03:38:51,770 --> 03:38:52,170
Alright.

5046
03:38:52,170 --> 03:38:52,370
Alright.

5047
03:38:54,150 --> 03:38:55,370
Oh, my god.

5048
03:38:55,450 --> 03:38:56,490
Get away from me.

5049
03:38:57,430 --> 03:38:58,710
Get away from me.

5050
03:39:01,730 --> 03:39:02,790
Alright, here you go.

5051
03:39:03,110 --> 03:39:04,830
He's so lovable.

5052
03:39:06,350 --> 03:39:07,710
Toki, I don't understand.

5053
03:39:08,390 --> 03:39:10,690
Why won't you love him if he was a worm?

5054
03:39:11,210 --> 03:39:12,690
Guys, he's a fucking worm!

5055
03:39:14,170 --> 03:39:14,690
Alright.

5056
03:39:20,820 --> 03:39:22,820
Alright, no way he's gonna be able to get...

5057
03:39:22,820 --> 03:39:24,080
Okay, never mind.

5058
03:39:24,160 --> 03:39:24,500
He is.

5059
03:39:24,740 --> 03:39:25,700
Alright, there you go.

5060
03:39:28,520 --> 03:39:29,800
And he chose it.

5061
03:39:29,840 --> 03:39:32,600
It's not like some magic power fucking made him a worm.

5062
03:39:38,260 --> 03:39:38,740
Oh.

5063
03:39:39,160 --> 03:39:39,800
That's it?

5064
03:39:40,520 --> 03:39:42,140
He just turns back to normal?

5065
03:39:46,100 --> 03:39:47,280
Hello, is this your...

5066
03:39:47,280 --> 03:39:48,580
Who's this guy, snake lady?

5067
03:39:50,200 --> 03:39:50,680
What?

5068
03:39:51,200 --> 03:39:51,680
Hmph.

5069
03:39:52,300 --> 03:39:55,440
These ordinary people don't know what they're doing.

5070
03:39:55,980 --> 03:39:57,980
Oh, god!

5071
03:40:01,780 --> 03:40:04,580
Oh, god!

5072
03:40:04,580 --> 03:40:05,080
She's...

5073
03:40:07,780 --> 03:40:09,180
She's...

5074
03:40:09,180 --> 03:40:09,200
She's...

5075
03:40:09,200 --> 03:40:10,240
She's beautiful.

5076
03:40:16,770 --> 03:40:18,170
She's...

5077
03:40:19,590 --> 03:40:20,990
She's...

5078
03:40:20,990 --> 03:40:22,050
She's...

5079
03:40:22,050 --> 03:40:23,510
She's...

5080
03:40:23,510 --> 03:40:24,130
She's beautiful.

5081
03:40:28,830 --> 03:40:30,050
Still would.

5082
03:40:30,350 --> 03:40:30,970
Still would.

5083
03:40:31,510 --> 03:40:31,870
Still would.

5084
03:40:33,990 --> 03:40:36,210
She's got the gamer neck.

5085
03:40:37,530 --> 03:40:39,410
She's got the gamer neck.

5086
03:40:42,590 --> 03:40:43,310
Oh

5087
03:40:49,090 --> 03:40:50,170
my god.

5088
03:40:50,250 --> 03:40:52,230
My staff is so fucking disgusting.

5089
03:40:52,610 --> 03:40:54,030
I just realized what it is.

5090
03:40:54,090 --> 03:40:55,790
Transform into a worm.

5091
03:40:56,510 --> 03:40:57,030
Why?

5092
03:40:57,590 --> 03:40:57,770
Why?

5093
03:40:57,770 --> 03:40:58,130
Why?

5094
03:41:02,330 --> 03:41:03,330
Guys!

5095
03:41:03,530 --> 03:41:05,310
We can do it!

5096
03:41:06,030 --> 03:41:07,170
Let me go...

5097
03:41:07,170 --> 03:41:09,670
Oh my god.

5098
03:41:09,710 --> 03:41:10,170
Okay.

5099
03:41:11,770 --> 03:41:17,690
We can finally be our true selves, guys.

5100
03:41:19,190 --> 03:41:22,510
We can finally be our true selves.

5101
03:41:23,390 --> 03:41:24,570
Oh my god.

5102
03:41:25,450 --> 03:41:26,710
Oh my god.

5103
03:41:26,970 --> 03:41:27,970
Okay.

5104
03:41:29,370 --> 03:41:30,450
That's funny.

5105
03:41:31,470 --> 03:41:32,450
Can I cultivate this?

5106
03:41:32,590 --> 03:41:33,390
Oh my god, I can.

5107
03:41:35,530 --> 03:41:38,390
Upgrade big baby before I do this.

5108
03:41:38,930 --> 03:41:39,710
Alright, guys.

5109
03:41:39,770 --> 03:41:42,450
Just for one moment, I'll do it for you.

5110
03:41:44,310 --> 03:41:44,910
Dragons.

5111
03:41:45,830 --> 03:41:48,650
Would you love me if I become a...

5112
03:41:48,650 --> 03:41:50,970
Oh god, I'm so fucking ugly.

5113
03:41:51,530 --> 03:41:57,350
Would you love me if I become a worm?

5114
03:41:58,790 --> 03:42:02,090
Tell me I'm beautiful dragons.

5115
03:42:02,370 --> 03:42:03,810
Tell me.

5116
03:42:11,150 --> 03:42:11,910
Please.

5117
03:42:12,450 --> 03:42:13,210
Please.

5118
03:42:17,470 --> 03:42:19,450
Oh my god.

5119
03:42:19,550 --> 03:42:21,870
That's how I fucking get out of world guide.

5120
03:42:23,610 --> 03:42:25,510
That's actually pretty disgusting.

5121
03:42:25,850 --> 03:42:26,770
I'm not gonna lie.

5122
03:42:27,350 --> 03:42:29,870
That's how I fucking get out of worm form too.

5123
03:42:31,110 --> 03:42:32,110
Alright, let's see.

5124
03:42:32,230 --> 03:42:34,010
We gotta go to the peak.

5125
03:42:37,050 --> 03:42:39,850
That's good knowing unsubscribe.

5126
03:42:42,590 --> 03:42:46,530
Alright, nice.

5127
03:42:46,570 --> 03:42:47,030
Let's go.

5128
03:42:48,170 --> 03:42:49,270
Up I go.

5129
03:42:51,070 --> 03:42:52,270
Up I go.

5130
03:42:52,930 --> 03:42:55,990
I still... I'll listen to your streams.

5131
03:43:02,620 --> 03:43:03,420
Oh.

5132
03:43:03,600 --> 03:43:04,320
What's this?

5133
03:43:05,060 --> 03:43:06,260
Oh my god.

5134
03:43:06,360 --> 03:43:07,600
Is that John Toomer?

5135
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:09,440
What the fuck is that?

5136
03:43:13,910 --> 03:43:14,710
Oh!

5137
03:43:16,190 --> 03:43:17,290
Oh my god.

5138
03:43:17,290 --> 03:43:17,870
It's pulsating.

5139
03:43:20,930 --> 03:43:22,170
That's an egg?

5140
03:43:22,930 --> 03:43:26,810
Is that another child from Chupacay?

5141
03:43:30,150 --> 03:43:31,410
Oh god.

5142
03:43:31,430 --> 03:43:32,910
Who did she fuck?

5143
03:43:33,950 --> 03:43:35,830
The Dusk Veil.

5144
03:43:35,950 --> 03:43:37,590
Who did she fuck?

5145
03:43:38,150 --> 03:43:40,870
What the fuck did you bang?

5146
03:43:41,790 --> 03:43:42,990
Like what?

5147
03:43:43,190 --> 03:43:44,550
Oh my god.

5148
03:43:44,630 --> 03:43:45,650
What is he?

5149
03:43:45,830 --> 03:43:47,770
How does he have low HP already?

5150
03:43:48,350 --> 03:43:49,110
Wait.

5151
03:43:49,730 --> 03:43:51,370
How does he have...

5152
03:43:52,530 --> 03:43:55,230
How did he start with half HP?

5153
03:43:55,590 --> 03:43:57,230
Did she bang a chicken?

5154
03:43:57,970 --> 03:43:58,730
Like...

5155
03:44:00,970 --> 03:44:03,230
Did he get fall damage?

5156
03:44:03,610 --> 03:44:04,830
Okay, that's pretty funny.

5157
03:44:04,930 --> 03:44:06,890
He literally got fall damage.

5158
03:44:07,110 --> 03:44:09,070
I was like, wait a minute.

5159
03:44:09,530 --> 03:44:11,750
I did not do that.

5160
03:44:13,310 --> 03:44:14,710
You boy.

5161
03:44:16,850 --> 03:44:18,130
Oh my god.

5162
03:44:18,190 --> 03:44:19,370
She fucked a chicken.

5163
03:44:21,130 --> 03:44:21,830
Sorry.

5164
03:44:22,790 --> 03:44:24,250
What's wrong with her?

5165
03:44:24,530 --> 03:44:25,130
Bro.

5166
03:44:26,230 --> 03:44:27,450
Bro, she went...

5167
03:44:27,450 --> 03:44:29,730
Bro, that breakup was hard on her.

5168
03:44:29,770 --> 03:44:30,350
Not gonna lie.

5169
03:44:30,370 --> 03:44:30,910
I think...

5170
03:44:30,910 --> 03:44:35,530
I think the breakup with Pixie was really hard on her.

5171
03:44:35,730 --> 03:44:38,630
Like, she got drunk and she got busy.

5172
03:44:39,010 --> 03:44:39,750
She got...

5173
03:44:39,750 --> 03:44:42,170
She got real busy.

5174
03:44:45,110 --> 03:44:47,430
The breakup did not do so well.

5175
03:44:48,690 --> 03:44:49,250
No!

5176
03:44:49,410 --> 03:44:51,030
Are you fucking... I hate you.

5177
03:44:51,350 --> 03:44:53,170
I hate you so much.

5178
03:44:54,510 --> 03:44:56,150
I hate you.

5179
03:44:56,770 --> 03:44:58,210
I hate you.

5180
03:45:00,610 --> 03:45:01,170
Okay.

5181
03:45:03,850 --> 03:45:04,950
Oh my god.

5182
03:45:05,010 --> 03:45:05,330
Please.

5183
03:45:06,190 --> 03:45:06,750
Okay.

5184
03:45:08,470 --> 03:45:09,370
Wait, what?

5185
03:45:09,950 --> 03:45:13,390
Oh, I did not mean to drink, but that's alright, I guess.

5186
03:45:14,250 --> 03:45:15,570
That's okay, I guess.

5187
03:45:17,350 --> 03:45:18,730
Oh, Jesus Christ.

5188
03:45:18,830 --> 03:45:19,110
Okay.

5189
03:45:21,210 --> 03:45:21,770
Okay.

5190
03:45:23,610 --> 03:45:24,090
Nice.

5191
03:45:25,690 --> 03:45:26,170
Freeze.

5192
03:45:26,690 --> 03:45:27,630
Get the legs!

5193
03:45:27,770 --> 03:45:28,710
Get the legs!

5194
03:45:30,270 --> 03:45:30,750
Whoa!

5195
03:45:33,500 --> 03:45:33,980
Shit!

5196
03:45:34,060 --> 03:45:34,320
Okay.

5197
03:45:34,480 --> 03:45:35,020
That's fine.

5198
03:45:38,980 --> 03:45:40,440
Oh my god, alright.

5199
03:45:40,700 --> 03:45:41,240
It's fine.

5200
03:45:41,300 --> 03:45:41,680
We're fine.

5201
03:45:41,780 --> 03:45:42,220
We're okay.

5202
03:45:44,880 --> 03:45:46,920
Look, we all had those types of phases.

5203
03:45:47,240 --> 03:45:49,080
I know a breakup was hard for you.

5204
03:45:50,620 --> 03:45:51,100
Okay.

5205
03:45:54,200 --> 03:45:54,680
Nice.

5206
03:45:54,680 --> 03:45:55,420
Just one more hit.

5207
03:45:56,500 --> 03:45:56,980
Whoa!

5208
03:45:57,740 --> 03:45:58,180
What?

5209
03:45:58,800 --> 03:46:00,060
Okay, we still did it.

5210
03:46:03,300 --> 03:46:04,640
Oh no, not phase two.

5211
03:46:04,700 --> 03:46:06,000
Oh, this looks like a phase two.

5212
03:46:06,200 --> 03:46:07,040
This looks like...

5213
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:08,020
There was no name.

5214
03:46:08,180 --> 03:46:09,340
There was no name.

5215
03:46:09,560 --> 03:46:10,880
There was no name.

5216
03:46:13,100 --> 03:46:15,400
I killed him, but no name showed up.

5217
03:46:17,480 --> 03:46:18,360
Second phase.

5218
03:46:18,440 --> 03:46:19,340
The Blood Moon?

5219
03:46:28,360 --> 03:46:29,200
Oh no.

5220
03:46:30,020 --> 03:46:32,240
It's never good when there's a Blood Moon.

5221
03:46:33,180 --> 03:46:33,500
Alright.

5222
03:46:34,040 --> 03:46:36,160
Blood Moon taught me anything.

5223
03:46:36,760 --> 03:46:38,620
When the moon is red.

5224
03:46:40,100 --> 03:46:43,340
When he healed, he got a sword!

5225
03:46:45,540 --> 03:46:47,040
What the fuck?

5226
03:46:47,060 --> 03:46:48,740
Who gave the chicken a sword?

5227
03:46:49,520 --> 03:46:50,160
Like...

5228
03:46:51,500 --> 03:46:52,220
No!

5229
03:46:52,480 --> 03:46:54,220
I don't get the fall damage!

5230
03:46:57,360 --> 03:46:59,900
What the fuck?

5231
03:46:59,900 --> 03:47:02,660
Holy shit!

5232
03:47:03,460 --> 03:47:07,200
That's absolutely fucking insane damage!

5233
03:47:07,820 --> 03:47:09,920
Oh my god!

5234
03:47:10,780 --> 03:47:13,900
The baby has a knife now!

5235
03:47:14,140 --> 03:47:16,560
That shit one shot!

5236
03:47:17,560 --> 03:47:20,840
I got shredded.

5237
03:47:21,400 --> 03:47:24,760
Oh my god, the giant chicken still got me.

5238
03:47:26,180 --> 03:47:27,740
I got chicken.

5239
03:47:27,740 --> 03:47:28,100
No!

5240
03:47:28,460 --> 03:47:29,680
Are you serious?

5241
03:47:29,880 --> 03:47:30,820
Oh wait, what?

5242
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:32,360
How come he shows up with...

5243
03:47:32,360 --> 03:47:33,760
Oh my god.

5244
03:47:33,980 --> 03:47:36,120
Only happens to Doki.

5245
03:47:37,360 --> 03:47:38,300
Oh, okay.

5246
03:47:38,540 --> 03:47:39,860
Like, I'll take that.

5247
03:47:40,840 --> 03:47:41,400
Okay.

5248
03:47:42,780 --> 03:47:44,360
I mean, that's good.

5249
03:47:44,620 --> 03:47:45,120
That's good.

5250
03:47:45,180 --> 03:47:46,540
He also fucked up too.

5251
03:47:47,100 --> 03:47:48,540
Like, we fucked up together.

5252
03:47:48,760 --> 03:47:49,540
That's good.

5253
03:47:52,060 --> 03:47:53,540
Like, we fucked up together.

5254
03:47:54,080 --> 03:47:56,280
Like, he was like, that's embarrassing.

5255
03:47:56,600 --> 03:48:01,720
But then he was like, you know what, let's let's both be a little embarrassing together.

5256
03:48:02,300 --> 03:48:03,960
I really appreciate that chicken.

5257
03:48:05,560 --> 03:48:07,220
He doesn't know how to fly yet.

5258
03:48:07,240 --> 03:48:07,460
Yeah.

5259
03:48:08,940 --> 03:48:10,660
Oh, I can see underneath him.

5260
03:48:11,080 --> 03:48:12,840
Is he a boy or a girl?

5261
03:48:13,660 --> 03:48:14,840
We'll find out soon!

5262
03:48:16,560 --> 03:48:17,200
Oh, nice.

5263
03:48:17,320 --> 03:48:18,880
Okay, we insta teleported there.

5264
03:48:19,480 --> 03:48:20,100
That's good.

5265
03:48:21,840 --> 03:48:22,660
Okay, come on.

5266
03:48:23,120 --> 03:48:23,780
Come on!

5267
03:48:25,360 --> 03:48:26,820
Let me hit you!

5268
03:48:28,600 --> 03:48:31,000
Oh, I He's a girl?

5269
03:48:32,280 --> 03:48:35,280
Oh, thank god that hits.

5270
03:48:35,380 --> 03:48:36,040
Oh, thank god.

5271
03:48:36,060 --> 03:48:37,560
I was so scared that didn't hit.

5272
03:48:38,720 --> 03:48:39,140
Okay.

5273
03:48:40,560 --> 03:48:41,140
All right.

5274
03:48:41,280 --> 03:48:41,840
Get over here.

5275
03:48:43,620 --> 03:48:44,240
All right.

5276
03:48:45,980 --> 03:48:46,400
Okay.

5277
03:48:48,060 --> 03:48:48,480
Okay.

5278
03:48:50,400 --> 03:48:50,820
Okay.

5279
03:48:50,920 --> 03:48:51,480
Is he?

5280
03:48:52,140 --> 03:48:52,560
No!

5281
03:48:52,640 --> 03:48:53,060
Okay.

5282
03:48:54,300 --> 03:48:55,120
That's all right.

5283
03:48:55,360 --> 03:48:56,740
You're still learning how to walk.

5284
03:48:57,120 --> 03:48:57,560
Child.

5285
03:48:59,020 --> 03:48:59,740
That's okay.

5286
03:49:00,060 --> 03:49:01,560
I know you're still learning.

5287
03:49:02,900 --> 03:49:04,640
I don't want to use the cloud step yet.

5288
03:49:04,740 --> 03:49:06,080
Because I want to use it for heals.

5289
03:49:06,640 --> 03:49:07,920
For emergency heals.

5290
03:49:08,080 --> 03:49:09,120
Like, I don't want to waste it yet.

5291
03:49:10,160 --> 03:49:10,820
All right.

5292
03:49:11,940 --> 03:49:12,380
Freeze!

5293
03:49:12,760 --> 03:49:13,400
Oh, thank god.

5294
03:49:13,560 --> 03:49:15,060
Thank god I can still hit the toes.

5295
03:49:15,340 --> 03:49:19,600
Thank fucking god I can still hit the toes.

5296
03:49:21,700 --> 03:49:22,300
Oh, no!

5297
03:49:22,360 --> 03:49:22,840
I didn't mean it!

5298
03:49:23,220 --> 03:49:23,660
No!

5299
03:49:23,780 --> 03:49:24,780
I didn't mean to heal twice!

5300
03:49:25,580 --> 03:49:26,060
No!

5301
03:49:31,240 --> 03:49:31,720
Okay.

5302
03:49:32,380 --> 03:49:34,040
That's so unlucky for me.

5303
03:49:35,060 --> 03:49:37,040
Only happens to Toki.

5304
03:49:38,620 --> 03:49:39,100
Okay.

5305
03:49:39,160 --> 03:49:39,480
Nice.

5306
03:49:41,520 --> 03:49:42,000
No!

5307
03:49:42,160 --> 03:49:42,600
Fuck!

5308
03:49:43,480 --> 03:49:43,960
Fuck!

5309
03:49:44,020 --> 03:49:44,240
Okay.

5310
03:49:44,900 --> 03:49:45,480
All right.

5311
03:49:45,500 --> 03:49:45,700
Nice.

5312
03:49:45,700 --> 03:49:46,380
I'm underneath him.

5313
03:49:46,480 --> 03:49:47,620
He can't get me when I'm underneath.

5314
03:49:49,860 --> 03:49:50,340
Okay.

5315
03:49:50,500 --> 03:49:51,320
That's unlucky.

5316
03:49:51,500 --> 03:49:52,120
But that's okay.

5317
03:49:52,220 --> 03:49:54,040
I'm still underneath him.

5318
03:49:54,620 --> 03:49:55,100
Please!

5319
03:49:56,140 --> 03:49:58,200
Let me hit one hit!

5320
03:49:58,340 --> 03:49:59,220
Oh, thank god.

5321
03:49:59,280 --> 03:49:59,480
Okay.

5322
03:50:01,480 --> 03:50:02,240
Okay.

5323
03:50:02,240 --> 03:50:04,720
Hit the little toe for maximum damage.

5324
03:50:13,240 --> 03:50:13,620
Okay.

5325
03:50:13,740 --> 03:50:14,040
Nice.

5326
03:50:14,360 --> 03:50:18,620
He starts damage because the scorpion king will show up.

5327
03:50:18,940 --> 03:50:19,460
Whoops!

5328
03:50:22,160 --> 03:50:22,920
Wait.

5329
03:50:23,080 --> 03:50:26,160
Am I not supposed to kill the scorpion king?

5330
03:50:26,740 --> 03:50:27,500
Like...

5331
03:50:29,220 --> 03:50:29,980
What?!

5332
03:50:33,130 --> 03:50:34,310
Oh, gosh.

5333
03:50:34,430 --> 03:50:34,750
Okay.

5334
03:50:34,750 --> 03:50:34,950
Okay.

5335
03:50:36,030 --> 03:50:36,670
Okay.

5336
03:50:37,250 --> 03:50:37,890
Okay.

5337
03:50:39,210 --> 03:50:39,850
Okay.

5338
03:50:42,810 --> 03:50:44,590
Oh my god.

5339
03:50:44,670 --> 03:50:45,030
Alright.

5340
03:50:45,970 --> 03:50:47,050
Alright, buddy.

5341
03:50:50,610 --> 03:50:51,250
Okay.

5342
03:50:51,750 --> 03:50:54,450
I took damage, but that's okay, I guess.

5343
03:50:55,950 --> 03:50:56,910
Let me heal here.

5344
03:51:00,030 --> 03:51:00,350
What?

5345
03:51:00,430 --> 03:51:01,270
How does that hit me?

5346
03:51:02,110 --> 03:51:02,750
Wow!

5347
03:51:07,080 --> 03:51:07,500
Wow!

5348
03:51:09,040 --> 03:51:09,960
Oh my god.

5349
03:51:10,000 --> 03:51:12,220
Are you sure that's not the pig as well?

5350
03:51:15,000 --> 03:51:16,040
Oh god!

5351
03:51:16,140 --> 03:51:16,440
Oh!

5352
03:51:16,460 --> 03:51:16,880
Whoa!

5353
03:51:16,980 --> 03:51:17,180
Whoa!

5354
03:51:17,860 --> 03:51:20,620
Time to keep... flying!

5355
03:51:22,520 --> 03:51:23,260
Okay, nice.

5356
03:51:23,720 --> 03:51:26,080
I'm gonna fucking speed up the arm.

5357
03:51:26,460 --> 03:51:28,480
I'm gonna speed up the arm.

5358
03:51:29,520 --> 03:51:30,380
Please don't fly.

5359
03:51:31,600 --> 03:51:32,560
That's all I ask.

5360
03:51:35,180 --> 03:51:35,960
Okay, nice.

5361
03:51:37,080 --> 03:51:39,160
It's tiger... oh wait, dragon time!

5362
03:51:39,580 --> 03:51:41,040
It's dragon time!

5363
03:51:41,640 --> 03:51:42,280
Oh no.

5364
03:51:43,700 --> 03:51:44,340
Okay.

5365
03:51:44,500 --> 03:51:45,300
That's fine.

5366
03:51:45,760 --> 03:51:46,840
Dragon time!

5367
03:51:49,300 --> 03:51:50,500
I'm just glad the baby hit.

5368
03:51:50,780 --> 03:51:53,640
Like, I'm just so happy I hit the baby.

5369
03:51:54,420 --> 03:51:58,040
The baby is like... I swear, the baby is so hard to hit sometimes.

5370
03:51:59,100 --> 03:52:00,240
Oh, please.

5371
03:52:01,300 --> 03:52:02,380
Please stop moving.

5372
03:52:04,100 --> 03:52:04,980
Okay, nice.

5373
03:52:07,080 --> 03:52:07,640
Come on.

5374
03:52:07,940 --> 03:52:08,940
More damage!

5375
03:52:09,120 --> 03:52:09,640
Come on!

5376
03:52:09,700 --> 03:52:10,460
More damage!

5377
03:52:12,500 --> 03:52:13,400
Does it...

5378
03:52:14,260 --> 03:52:16,240
Do as much as you can, old man!

5379
03:52:19,350 --> 03:52:19,640
No.

5380
03:52:21,200 --> 03:52:22,420
It's okay, we're fine.

5381
03:52:22,600 --> 03:52:24,060
We're so healthy.

5382
03:52:24,480 --> 03:52:26,140
Wait, why am I so slow sometimes?

5383
03:52:26,900 --> 03:52:27,480
Whoa!

5384
03:52:27,980 --> 03:52:28,520
Whoa!

5385
03:52:29,340 --> 03:52:29,920
Whoa!

5386
03:52:30,280 --> 03:52:31,060
Oh, no.

5387
03:52:31,540 --> 03:52:32,120
Heal.

5388
03:52:33,460 --> 03:52:35,400
He doesn't know where I am.

5389
03:52:36,280 --> 03:52:37,220
Oh, shit!

5390
03:52:37,400 --> 03:52:37,660
Okay.

5391
03:52:38,440 --> 03:52:39,100
I'm sorry.

5392
03:52:39,220 --> 03:52:39,940
I'm so sorry.

5393
03:52:40,300 --> 03:52:42,040
I'm so sorry for making fun of you.

5394
03:52:44,560 --> 03:52:45,460
Oh, no.

5395
03:52:45,840 --> 03:52:46,660
He angry.

5396
03:52:46,900 --> 03:52:47,460
He angry.

5397
03:52:48,680 --> 03:52:49,480
Oh, shit!

5398
03:52:49,800 --> 03:52:51,260
I hate the way he does that.

5399
03:52:52,420 --> 03:52:53,280
Oh, no!

5400
03:52:53,780 --> 03:52:54,180
No!

5401
03:52:54,440 --> 03:52:54,840
No!

5402
03:52:55,020 --> 03:52:55,420
No!

5403
03:52:55,540 --> 03:52:55,940
No!

5404
03:52:56,440 --> 03:52:57,260
Please, I need to heal.

5405
03:52:59,580 --> 03:53:00,540
Oh, thank God.

5406
03:53:00,560 --> 03:53:00,740
Okay.

5407
03:53:00,840 --> 03:53:01,920
I thought he was gonna fly.

5408
03:53:02,900 --> 03:53:03,960
At least he didn't fly.

5409
03:53:06,200 --> 03:53:07,300
Come on!

5410
03:53:09,940 --> 03:53:11,080
Oh, shit!

5411
03:53:11,200 --> 03:53:11,500
Okay.

5412
03:53:12,160 --> 03:53:13,160
Okay, we're fine.

5413
03:53:13,740 --> 03:53:14,680
We're not fine.

5414
03:53:14,780 --> 03:53:17,460
But, like, you know, I'm making do with what I have.

5415
03:53:20,080 --> 03:53:21,080
I don't...

5416
03:53:21,080 --> 03:53:22,220
Oh, no!

5417
03:53:22,420 --> 03:53:24,160
I didn't press two of

5418
03:53:33,590 --> 03:53:34,210
an animation!

5419
03:53:35,430 --> 03:53:35,990
I

5420
03:53:39,080 --> 03:53:40,900
had two more heals, too.

5421
03:53:42,340 --> 03:53:43,560
It's not fine.

5422
03:53:43,780 --> 03:53:44,780
I had two...

5423
03:53:44,780 --> 03:53:46,260
I had two more syphs.

5424
03:53:50,580 --> 03:53:52,480
Oh, my God.

5425
03:53:52,620 --> 03:53:54,280
We're so close.

5426
03:53:55,870 --> 03:53:57,400
Wait, you do that now?

5427
03:53:57,780 --> 03:53:59,720
Are you fucking...

5428
03:54:01,950 --> 03:54:02,460
Okay.

5429
03:54:06,720 --> 03:54:07,740
Okay.

5430
03:54:08,710 --> 03:54:09,840
Like, alright.

5431
03:54:11,800 --> 03:54:12,820
Okay.

5432
03:54:15,830 --> 03:54:16,620
That's fine.

5433
03:54:17,100 --> 03:54:17,580
Like...

5434
03:54:17,580 --> 03:54:19,360
That is...

5435
03:54:19,360 --> 03:54:20,240
That is A-okay.

5436
03:54:20,780 --> 03:54:23,160
That is A...

5437
03:54:24,330 --> 03:54:25,600
That's A-okay.

5438
03:54:25,980 --> 03:54:27,680
I'm okay with that.

5439
03:54:29,780 --> 03:54:30,640
I'm...

5440
03:54:32,110 --> 03:54:33,760
I'm so okay, guys.

5441
03:54:35,460 --> 03:54:37,660
I can't believe it.

5442
03:54:37,970 --> 03:54:40,820
I can't believe my freeze did that.

5443
03:54:41,400 --> 03:54:42,960
I'm so sad.

5444
03:54:43,970 --> 03:54:45,460
I'm so sad.

5445
03:54:45,460 --> 03:54:50,080
That... that is actually other bullshit, not gonna lie.

5446
03:54:51,020 --> 03:54:54,820
I HATE THIS FUCKING CHICKEN!

5447
03:54:54,920 --> 03:54:57,700
I hate this chicken so much.

5448
03:54:58,120 --> 03:55:00,920
Holy shit, this chicken.

5449
03:55:01,200 --> 03:55:03,260
This goddamn chicken.

5450
03:55:04,360 --> 03:55:10,300
This chicken is gonna be the pain of my existence.

5451
03:55:12,120 --> 03:55:14,060
Oh my god.

5452
03:55:14,060 --> 03:55:18,480
I don't like the animation timing for that too sometimes.

5453
03:55:19,660 --> 03:55:21,420
I have to avoid it.

5454
03:55:22,740 --> 03:55:23,460
Okay.

5455
03:55:23,580 --> 03:55:25,260
Oh shit!

5456
03:55:25,540 --> 03:55:25,980
Ow.

5457
03:55:26,660 --> 03:55:27,380
Ow.

5458
03:55:27,980 --> 03:55:28,360
Ow.

5459
03:55:28,940 --> 03:55:30,240
Okay, that's fine.

5460
03:55:30,460 --> 03:55:33,980
We can... we can mated him from underneath.

5461
03:55:34,420 --> 03:55:35,260
It's okay.

5462
03:55:36,480 --> 03:55:38,940
We have... we have the backside!

5463
03:55:41,640 --> 03:55:42,360
Boom!

5464
03:55:42,360 --> 03:55:42,920
Alright.

5465
03:55:43,200 --> 03:55:44,040
Now we just gotta...

5466
03:55:44,060 --> 03:55:44,220
We just gotta recharge.

5467
03:55:45,340 --> 03:55:45,740
Okay.

5468
03:55:46,500 --> 03:55:47,900
Just have to recharge here.

5469
03:55:48,140 --> 03:55:48,800
Oh shit!

5470
03:55:48,880 --> 03:55:49,080
Ow.

5471
03:55:50,980 --> 03:55:51,480
It's fine.

5472
03:55:51,560 --> 03:55:52,160
We're underneath him!

5473
03:55:52,320 --> 03:55:53,240
He doesn't know what to do!

5474
03:55:53,340 --> 03:55:53,700
Wait, I'm underneath!

5475
03:55:54,560 --> 03:55:55,340
That's fucking right!

5476
03:55:56,640 --> 03:55:57,440
Oh, bitch!

5477
03:55:58,620 --> 03:55:59,020
Okay.

5478
03:55:59,340 --> 03:56:00,320
I'm underneath him again!

5479
03:56:00,620 --> 03:56:01,380
He doesn't know!

5480
03:56:01,940 --> 03:56:02,340
Haha!

5481
03:56:05,300 --> 03:56:05,860
That's right.

5482
03:56:05,980 --> 03:56:06,160
Okay.

5483
03:56:06,740 --> 03:56:07,540
The backshot.

5484
03:56:07,580 --> 03:56:09,660
We got the backshot down to the T.

5485
03:56:10,160 --> 03:56:11,600
It's the Blood Moon phase.

5486
03:56:16,760 --> 03:56:17,740
Alright, here we go.

5487
03:56:18,920 --> 03:56:20,180
It's this phase.

5488
03:56:20,280 --> 03:56:21,920
Oh my god, this phase is crazy.

5489
03:56:22,800 --> 03:56:26,740
This phase he does whatever the fuck he wants apparently.

5490
03:56:26,960 --> 03:56:27,560
I...

5491
03:56:28,520 --> 03:56:28,840
Yep.

5492
03:56:29,500 --> 03:56:29,820
Yep.

5493
03:56:31,700 --> 03:56:35,140
He does whatever the fuck the chicken wants apparently.

5494
03:56:36,660 --> 03:56:38,120
Chicken wants this!

5495
03:56:41,000 --> 03:56:41,640
Okay.

5496
03:56:41,840 --> 03:56:42,480
God...

5497
03:56:42,480 --> 03:56:45,280
He doesn't let me go behind him like the other times.

5498
03:56:45,560 --> 03:56:46,360
Like he's...

5499
03:56:46,360 --> 03:56:47,140
Chicken has learned.

5500
03:56:48,060 --> 03:56:50,060
Like chicken has definitely learned.

5501
03:56:51,920 --> 03:56:53,540
Chicken has learned so much.

5502
03:56:54,480 --> 03:56:55,880
Chicken, why are you learning?

5503
03:56:58,000 --> 03:56:58,440
Wait.

5504
03:56:58,920 --> 03:56:59,640
Wait, what?

5505
03:56:59,800 --> 03:57:00,580
Did I not heal?

5506
03:57:00,720 --> 03:57:01,480
No, I did.

5507
03:57:01,580 --> 03:57:03,320
I just lost so much HP for that.

5508
03:57:03,640 --> 03:57:04,080
How?

5509
03:57:07,040 --> 03:57:07,480
Okay.

5510
03:57:07,580 --> 03:57:07,820
Nice.

5511
03:57:07,900 --> 03:57:08,880
I got the timing for that.

5512
03:57:08,940 --> 03:57:09,160
Okay.

5513
03:57:09,600 --> 03:57:10,220
That's good.

5514
03:57:10,800 --> 03:57:11,480
That's good.

5515
03:57:12,340 --> 03:57:14,080
That's so good for me.

5516
03:57:15,660 --> 03:57:16,100
Okay.

5517
03:57:16,100 --> 03:57:16,500
No.

5518
03:57:18,000 --> 03:57:18,600
Dragon.

5519
03:57:20,540 --> 03:57:21,140
Dragon.

5520
03:57:26,690 --> 03:57:28,750
We need you more than ever.

5521
03:57:33,150 --> 03:57:35,870
We need you more than ever, old man.

5522
03:57:37,350 --> 03:57:39,870
This is your moment to shine.

5523
03:57:42,270 --> 03:57:42,870
Yes!

5524
03:57:43,290 --> 03:57:45,990
I don't know if I hit that, but I assume I did.

5525
03:57:47,730 --> 03:57:49,670
What the world needs you most.

5526
03:57:52,610 --> 03:57:53,010
Okay.

5527
03:57:54,190 --> 03:57:54,990
Where did he go?

5528
03:57:55,390 --> 03:57:56,110
Oh, there you are.

5529
03:57:56,810 --> 03:58:01,050
Where did he go?

5530
03:58:03,710 --> 03:58:04,310
Okay, nice.

5531
03:58:05,930 --> 03:58:07,050
Oh, I got the legs.

5532
03:58:07,150 --> 03:58:07,430
Nice.

5533
03:58:08,310 --> 03:58:08,890
That's good.

5534
03:58:10,790 --> 03:58:11,490
Oh, no.

5535
03:58:11,830 --> 03:58:12,710
Oh, no.

5536
03:58:12,750 --> 03:58:13,510
That got me.

5537
03:58:13,570 --> 03:58:13,770
No!

5538
03:58:16,110 --> 03:58:16,510
Okay.

5539
03:58:17,010 --> 03:58:18,010
How did that?

5540
03:58:18,110 --> 03:58:18,450
Okay.

5541
03:58:19,290 --> 03:58:20,450
That got me.

5542
03:58:20,510 --> 03:58:20,730
Okay.

5543
03:58:22,010 --> 03:58:22,250
All right.

5544
03:58:23,010 --> 03:58:23,450
Fine.

5545
03:58:23,610 --> 03:58:24,630
You can have that.

5546
03:58:27,310 --> 03:58:29,570
I don't know how, but you can have it, I guess.

5547
03:58:32,410 --> 03:58:32,850
Okay.

5548
03:58:36,710 --> 03:58:37,150
Okay.

5549
03:58:42,980 --> 03:58:44,680
What the fuck?

5550
03:58:44,680 --> 03:58:45,060
Okay.

5551
03:58:45,180 --> 03:58:46,240
You can have that too.

5552
03:58:46,620 --> 03:58:47,280
All right.

5553
03:58:51,020 --> 03:58:51,460
Okay.

5554
03:58:51,460 --> 03:58:51,900
Okay.

5555
03:58:53,380 --> 03:58:54,840
You can have that as well.

5556
03:58:55,000 --> 03:58:56,760
I don't... Oh, my God.

5557
03:58:56,820 --> 03:58:57,180
Please.

5558
03:58:58,540 --> 03:58:59,100
Please.

5559
03:59:02,360 --> 03:59:03,480
Oh, shit.

5560
03:59:05,960 --> 03:59:06,880
Oh, my God.

5561
03:59:06,920 --> 03:59:07,180
Please.

5562
03:59:11,020 --> 03:59:11,580
Please.

5563
03:59:13,140 --> 03:59:14,020
Oh, my God.

5564
03:59:14,140 --> 03:59:14,780
That's it.

5565
03:59:14,840 --> 03:59:15,080
That's it.

5566
03:59:15,540 --> 03:59:16,100
No!

5567
03:59:17,600 --> 03:59:19,700
Are you fucking kidding me?

5568
03:59:19,780 --> 03:59:20,240
It's too...

5569
03:59:21,360 --> 03:59:23,060
Are you fucking...

5570
03:59:25,240 --> 03:59:26,660
Are you serious?

5571
03:59:26,720 --> 03:59:27,880
He's doing that thing again?

5572
03:59:31,780 --> 03:59:32,300
Please.

5573
03:59:32,720 --> 03:59:33,240
Please.

5574
03:59:34,720 --> 03:59:35,240
Please.

5575
03:59:35,300 --> 03:59:36,440
Oh, my God.

5576
03:59:36,480 --> 03:59:36,940
I got him.

5577
03:59:37,000 --> 03:59:37,800
I got him.

5578
03:59:38,300 --> 03:59:39,280
I got him.

5579
03:59:43,160 --> 03:59:44,200
Holy shit.

5580
03:59:50,120 --> 03:59:52,240
I can't believe all of them.

5581
03:59:52,700 --> 03:59:55,400
I couldn't kill him because he was in a combo.

5582
03:59:55,400 --> 04:00:00,180
These few few years since we met, you have been killed by them I thought.

5583
04:00:03,460 --> 04:00:04,700
Why didn't you help?

5584
04:00:05,040 --> 04:00:06,860
Were you just watching me?

5585
04:00:07,820 --> 04:00:08,260
Miss?

5586
04:00:08,260 --> 04:00:10,060
Were you literally just watching me, lady?

5587
04:00:25,360 --> 04:00:28,520
Guys, there's no chicken left.

5588
04:00:28,620 --> 04:00:30,700
There's no meat left in that fucking guy.

5589
04:00:32,040 --> 04:00:34,600
I don't know what you mean by fried chicken.

5590
04:00:34,800 --> 04:00:36,120
It's literally just bone.

5591
04:01:00,000 --> 04:01:01,100
What about your husband?

5592
04:01:01,880 --> 04:01:03,000
I thought we were trying to find your husband.

5593
04:01:03,240 --> 04:01:04,080
Your dead husband.

5594
04:01:04,760 --> 04:01:05,160
Oh!

5595
04:01:06,260 --> 04:01:08,240
Well, let's mix my fight boss up.

5596
04:01:08,240 --> 04:01:08,820
Just to classify it easier.

5597
04:01:13,940 --> 04:01:15,000
That's the husband?

5598
04:01:28,760 --> 04:01:30,560
How the fuck did he turn into that?

5599
04:01:32,420 --> 04:01:34,040
She married a chicken?

5600
04:01:37,820 --> 04:01:42,500
Oh, it's her adopted brother.

5601
04:01:51,160 --> 04:01:51,760
Oh!

5602
04:01:52,900 --> 04:01:54,360
Bro, that's messed up, lady.

5603
04:01:54,680 --> 04:01:56,820
That's your fucking not real brother.

5604
04:01:56,820 --> 04:01:58,820
But, like, you still have, like, family ties.

5605
04:02:06,400 --> 04:02:07,740
There was no husband?

5606
04:02:08,160 --> 04:02:10,160
Did everybody lie to me?

5607
04:02:11,840 --> 04:02:13,820
Oh, I finished it.

5608
04:02:13,860 --> 04:02:14,140
Okay.

5609
04:02:17,440 --> 04:02:19,060
I can't believe it.

5610
04:02:21,720 --> 04:02:22,980
Can't believe it.

5611
04:02:23,420 --> 04:02:24,380
Everybody's lying.

5612
04:02:27,940 --> 04:02:29,740
They all lied to me.

5613
04:02:31,240 --> 04:02:33,860
Does no one have integrity anymore?

5614
04:02:38,730 --> 04:02:41,290
Everybody lies to me and I can't talk.

5615
04:02:42,690 --> 04:02:44,910
I can't even defend myself.

5616
04:02:45,170 --> 04:02:46,210
It's so messed up.

5617
04:02:49,530 --> 04:02:52,550
Oh, hey, there's so many Buddha statues here.

5618
04:02:52,590 --> 04:02:53,230
Is there anything here?

5619
04:02:53,350 --> 04:02:53,770
Is there a secret?

5620
04:02:56,090 --> 04:02:57,630
All right, up we go.

5621
04:02:58,070 --> 04:02:59,230
I don't even remember how...

5622
04:02:59,230 --> 04:03:01,110
That world was so long.

5623
04:03:01,110 --> 04:03:03,530
I don't even remember what I was doing before.

5624
04:03:05,090 --> 04:03:09,850
I felt like I was trapped in this area for so long.

5625
04:03:15,920 --> 04:03:16,760
All right, nice.

5626
04:03:17,200 --> 04:03:18,420
Oh, I got a pill.

5627
04:03:20,540 --> 04:03:22,060
Yeah, that was a side quest.

5628
04:03:22,860 --> 04:03:26,480
I've been in this side quest for so long, I actually don't know what to do anymore.

5629
04:03:26,480 --> 04:03:28,520
I don't know what to do in the main storyline.

5630
04:03:31,960 --> 04:03:32,720
All right.

5631
04:03:33,000 --> 04:03:33,700
That it?

5632
04:03:33,700 --> 04:03:35,440
How do I get out of here?

5633
04:03:39,500 --> 04:03:41,020
Oh, I guess we go up here.

5634
04:03:42,580 --> 04:03:44,140
Oh, can I go back in?

5635
04:03:44,380 --> 04:03:45,540
Oh, I can.

5636
04:03:46,040 --> 04:03:47,100
I already finished it though.

5637
04:03:50,550 --> 04:03:54,790
I already finished the area there.

5638
04:03:58,210 --> 04:03:58,990
All right.

5639
04:03:59,090 --> 04:04:00,550
Now, I guess...

5640
04:04:03,740 --> 04:04:05,060
The talisman quest?

5641
04:04:05,740 --> 04:04:07,240
I had another quest?

5642
04:04:08,060 --> 04:04:09,240
Guys, I'm so...

5643
04:04:10,320 --> 04:04:10,620
I don't know.

5644
04:04:13,000 --> 04:04:15,060
That side quest was like...

5645
04:04:15,060 --> 04:04:16,900
It felt like 20 years, guys.

5646
04:04:17,560 --> 04:04:19,580
I'm just like, I had another one?

5647
04:04:19,820 --> 04:04:22,180
I had another side quest?

5648
04:04:27,300 --> 04:04:28,000
All right.

5649
04:04:28,200 --> 04:04:29,360
Oh, hey, item.

5650
04:04:30,860 --> 04:04:31,540
What's this?

5651
04:04:32,660 --> 04:04:33,640
Oh, a drink.

5652
04:04:37,150 --> 04:04:37,910
All right.

5653
04:04:40,030 --> 04:04:41,250
How did I get here?

5654
04:04:43,250 --> 04:04:45,410
Like what was this where?

5655
04:04:46,350 --> 04:04:48,430
How did I get here?

5656
04:04:52,090 --> 04:04:57,430
I'm trying to retrace my steps to figure out how I got here in general.

5657
04:04:57,870 --> 04:05:00,110
I don't remember how I got to this area.

5658
04:05:02,530 --> 04:05:03,870
Oh, pull the mushrooms?

5659
04:05:04,450 --> 04:05:06,310
Oh, is there a mushroom boss?

5660
04:05:06,590 --> 04:05:07,850
Oh, okay, I'll pull the mushroom.

5661
04:05:11,320 --> 04:05:12,080
All right.

5662
04:05:12,140 --> 04:05:12,700
Guess what?

5663
04:05:12,700 --> 04:05:13,440
Yeah,

5664
04:05:17,220 --> 04:05:20,520
this is why I don't pull the mushroom, because I know there's gonna be a boss.

5665
04:05:20,820 --> 04:05:24,520
This is exactly why I don't pull it.

5666
04:05:25,880 --> 04:05:29,020
Not like boss, but because I know one of them is a fucking...

5667
04:05:29,960 --> 04:05:32,480
Not boss, but just like... Oh, there you go.

5668
04:05:32,560 --> 04:05:34,400
Oh, it's a mushroom boss woman.

5669
04:05:35,920 --> 04:05:38,060
Because I know this guy was gonna show up.

5670
04:05:38,120 --> 04:05:39,040
Like a fucker.

5671
04:05:39,720 --> 04:05:40,400
There you go.

5672
04:05:40,920 --> 04:05:42,020
I'm just gonna use everything.

5673
04:05:42,020 --> 04:05:44,260
I can't be bothered.

5674
04:05:45,640 --> 04:05:48,820
He won't have a chance to get up at this rate.

5675
04:05:49,000 --> 04:05:49,560
You know what?

5676
04:05:49,640 --> 04:05:51,120
I'm bringing him too.

5677
04:05:51,280 --> 04:05:53,040
That fucking rap brought him over.

5678
04:05:53,440 --> 04:05:54,160
That's right.

5679
04:05:55,480 --> 04:05:57,680
You're not gonna be able to play the game.

5680
04:05:58,000 --> 04:05:59,840
Oh my god, he hits so hard.

5681
04:06:00,500 --> 04:06:01,540
Holy shit.

5682
04:06:01,980 --> 04:06:03,560
What the fuck?

5683
04:06:03,780 --> 04:06:06,660
Okay, I guess I don't play the...

5684
04:06:06,660 --> 04:06:08,280
Wait, he heals?

5685
04:06:17,520 --> 04:06:17,980
Okay.

5686
04:06:22,540 --> 04:06:24,620
How did he heal?

5687
04:06:27,020 --> 04:06:29,200
How does he... What?

5688
04:06:31,520 --> 04:06:33,040
I don't understand.

5689
04:06:35,280 --> 04:06:36,400
How is he healing?

5690
04:06:41,620 --> 04:06:44,840
Oh, he steals my... He has life steal!

5691
04:06:45,600 --> 04:06:46,940
Okay, this is bullshit.

5692
04:06:47,080 --> 04:06:48,420
This is actually bullshit.

5693
04:06:49,840 --> 04:06:51,100
Oh my god, this guy has life steal.

5694
04:06:51,780 --> 04:06:53,620
I don't even wanna fight him anymore.

5695
04:06:53,900 --> 04:06:56,780
I don't even wanna fight him anymore.

5696
04:07:00,280 --> 04:07:01,800
This is actually bullshit.

5697
04:07:02,220 --> 04:07:08,220
I used all that power up and it didn't matter because he had life steal!

5698
04:07:10,700 --> 04:07:11,560
Yeah, that's right.

5699
04:07:11,640 --> 04:07:12,320
We're gonna steal now.

5700
04:07:12,460 --> 04:07:13,860
He still stole my health!

5701
04:07:14,960 --> 04:07:16,160
I was invisible!

5702
04:07:16,580 --> 04:07:17,660
I was invisible!

5703
04:07:23,860 --> 04:07:28,480
I was actually invisible and he still stole my health!

5704
04:07:28,600 --> 04:07:29,820
That's actually crazy!

5705
04:07:30,900 --> 04:07:33,640
Wait a minute, that's actually illegal!

5706
04:07:36,700 --> 04:07:39,360
Oh my god, just don't get hit.

5707
04:07:39,600 --> 04:07:44,300
Guys, I went through this entire game about learning how to use that staff spin thing.

5708
04:07:44,680 --> 04:07:45,920
Guys, I don't know.

5709
04:07:45,920 --> 04:07:48,600
Oh my god, I don't know.

5710
04:07:54,100 --> 04:07:57,320
That's actually crazy that he has that though.

5711
04:07:58,820 --> 04:07:59,900
Oh wait, this... No!

5712
04:08:00,020 --> 04:08:00,780
No, I forgot!

5713
04:08:00,900 --> 04:08:02,580
He can steal my life with this guy.

5714
04:08:03,420 --> 04:08:04,440
This is not fair.

5715
04:08:07,840 --> 04:08:08,760
Oh no!

5716
04:08:08,920 --> 04:08:09,680
Oh no!

5717
04:08:12,860 --> 04:08:13,380
Okay.

5718
04:08:13,380 --> 04:08:13,520
Okay.

5719
04:08:17,530 --> 04:08:18,630
Oh no!

5720
04:08:21,550 --> 04:08:22,270
Oh come on!

5721
04:08:23,670 --> 04:08:24,350
No!

5722
04:08:24,630 --> 04:08:25,410
Don't you...

5723
04:08:27,450 --> 04:08:29,530
Don't you fucking dare!

5724
04:08:33,790 --> 04:08:35,490
Oh my god, bro.

5725
04:08:35,550 --> 04:08:36,310
This guy...

5726
04:08:40,090 --> 04:08:44,950
He's actually gonna be the bane of my existence with this stupid life steal.

5727
04:08:45,410 --> 04:08:46,970
Oh my god!

5728
04:08:46,970 --> 04:08:49,810
This boss took 20 years logging!

5729
04:08:52,710 --> 04:08:53,030
Jesus.

5730
04:08:54,770 --> 04:08:55,090
Alright.

5731
04:08:57,970 --> 04:09:02,170
Okay, we did it.

5732
04:09:02,310 --> 04:09:03,510
Where did I come from?

5733
04:09:04,890 --> 04:09:05,930
Oh my god.

5734
04:09:06,830 --> 04:09:07,470
Wait.

5735
04:09:08,590 --> 04:09:09,810
Where did I...

5736
04:09:09,810 --> 04:09:10,950
Which...

5737
04:09:10,950 --> 04:09:12,590
Where did I come from?

5738
04:09:12,870 --> 04:09:13,690
Oh, here.

5739
04:09:13,910 --> 04:09:14,350
Here.

5740
04:09:14,390 --> 04:09:15,450
I came from over there.

5741
04:09:15,450 --> 04:09:16,310
Okay.

5742
04:09:17,070 --> 04:09:18,270
Oh, I missed the soul?

5743
04:09:18,470 --> 04:09:19,190
Did I actually?

5744
04:09:19,970 --> 04:09:21,570
Do we need that guy's soul?

5745
04:09:24,970 --> 04:09:25,450
Alright.

5746
04:09:25,550 --> 04:09:27,810
We're gonna take this and then we're gonna...

5747
04:09:30,890 --> 04:09:33,490
We're gonna do the quest... I'm gonna do instant transmission.

5748
04:09:33,530 --> 04:09:36,330
I don't know how far I am anymore.

5749
04:09:41,930 --> 04:09:43,270
I can life steal with her?

5750
04:09:43,350 --> 04:09:44,430
Yeah, but big baby!

5751
04:09:45,250 --> 04:09:47,170
Big baby has never failed me.

5752
04:09:53,000 --> 04:09:53,440
Okay.

5753
04:09:53,600 --> 04:09:54,660
We go this way.

5754
04:09:54,920 --> 04:09:55,580
Where do we go?

5755
04:09:56,680 --> 04:09:58,740
She'll never get up to stop me.

5756
04:09:58,740 --> 04:09:59,980
I'm so quick.

5757
04:10:00,400 --> 04:10:00,840
Content.

5758
04:10:00,940 --> 04:10:01,800
Thank you for the super chat.

5759
04:10:01,920 --> 04:10:02,200
Thank you.

5760
04:10:02,240 --> 04:10:02,860
Thank you.

5761
04:10:02,960 --> 04:10:03,180
Alright.

5762
04:10:03,260 --> 04:10:03,780
Where do we go?

5763
04:10:04,600 --> 04:10:05,140
Oh, hey.

5764
04:10:05,180 --> 04:10:05,320
Brew.

5765
04:10:06,020 --> 04:10:06,460
Upgrade?

5766
04:10:07,060 --> 04:10:07,500
Ooh.

5767
04:10:09,660 --> 04:10:10,100
35.

5768
04:10:10,680 --> 04:10:12,620
Grants a considerable amount of chi?

5769
04:10:13,740 --> 04:10:15,060
Yeah, but that's not mana.

5770
04:10:15,780 --> 04:10:16,860
I like the mana.

5771
04:10:17,780 --> 04:10:18,400
What's this?

5772
04:10:19,860 --> 04:10:20,300
Okay.

5773
04:10:20,340 --> 04:10:20,920
We don't need that.

5774
04:10:24,360 --> 04:10:25,940
Up those stairs?

5775
04:10:26,280 --> 04:10:27,620
Behind the trees.

5776
04:10:27,900 --> 04:10:28,180
Okay.

5777
04:10:36,110 --> 04:10:36,420
Stairs.

5778
04:10:36,520 --> 04:10:36,760
Okay.

5779
04:10:36,880 --> 04:10:38,940
I was like, where's the stairs?

5780
04:10:39,660 --> 04:10:40,280
Okay.

5781
04:10:40,320 --> 04:10:41,560
Up those stairs.

5782
04:10:44,110 --> 04:10:45,140
I can make a new staff?

5783
04:10:50,060 --> 04:10:50,680
Okay.

5784
04:10:50,700 --> 04:10:51,280
Nice.

5785
04:10:55,920 --> 04:10:56,900
Craft weapon.

5786
04:10:58,100 --> 04:10:59,040
No, I can't.

5787
04:10:59,120 --> 04:11:00,200
Fucking liars.

5788
04:11:03,820 --> 04:11:04,540
Oh, wait.

5789
04:11:04,620 --> 04:11:04,980
No, I can.

5790
04:11:05,040 --> 04:11:05,260
I can.

5791
04:11:05,440 --> 04:11:05,920
Never mind.

5792
04:11:06,020 --> 04:11:06,200
JK.

5793
04:11:06,420 --> 04:11:07,680
I never called you a liar.

5794
04:11:11,500 --> 04:11:13,100
I'm only joking, guys.

5795
04:11:16,820 --> 04:11:21,340
Modern increases the damage by all Pillar Stance moves.

5796
04:11:21,560 --> 04:11:25,000
A long can be summoned to execute thunder at the enemy at Pillar Stance.

5797
04:11:25,120 --> 04:11:27,320
A cost of...

5798
04:11:27,320 --> 04:11:28,740
I was just joking.

5799
04:11:29,200 --> 04:11:30,660
I never said that.

5800
04:11:34,540 --> 04:11:37,120
I'll never call you guys liars.

5801
04:11:37,460 --> 04:11:38,060
Yeah?

5802
04:11:38,360 --> 04:11:39,340
Oh, there's the shrine.

5803
04:11:41,360 --> 04:11:42,360
There it is.

5804
04:11:48,780 --> 04:11:49,460
Yay!

5805
04:11:50,160 --> 04:11:51,400
I did it.

5806
04:11:56,790 --> 04:11:58,690
Oh, he looks mean.

5807
04:12:02,110 --> 04:12:03,410
What the fuck?

5808
04:12:03,970 --> 04:12:05,310
How do you eat?

5809
04:12:07,470 --> 04:12:08,530
Where's your mouth?

5810
04:12:08,730 --> 04:12:09,130
I can't.

5811
04:12:09,130 --> 04:12:10,510
You only have one hole?

5812
04:12:10,790 --> 04:12:11,970
Or two holes?

5813
04:12:12,570 --> 04:12:13,930
Like, where's your map?

5814
04:12:16,810 --> 04:12:17,810
I'm just concerned.

5815
04:12:19,250 --> 04:12:20,790
Like, I don't understand.

5816
04:12:24,170 --> 04:12:25,890
Wait, that's it?

5817
04:12:27,670 --> 04:12:28,910
All hands!

5818
04:12:29,410 --> 04:12:30,450
Underneath that!

5819
04:12:30,690 --> 04:12:33,010
Underneath the chest!

5820
04:12:41,410 --> 04:12:42,510
Oh, he's a bird!

5821
04:12:58,130 --> 04:12:59,330
Which one?

5822
04:12:59,330 --> 04:13:00,230
There's so many girls.

5823
04:13:09,150 --> 04:13:09,850
Wait, no!

5824
04:13:15,050 --> 04:13:15,930
That's fucked!

5825
04:13:17,990 --> 04:13:19,550
I just met her too!

5826
04:13:20,250 --> 04:13:20,810
Like...

5827
04:13:22,670 --> 04:13:23,230
Bro!

5828
04:13:23,370 --> 04:13:25,470
Why did you assume she was my girlfriend?

5829
04:13:26,290 --> 04:13:27,970
I literally just met her!

5830
04:13:30,350 --> 04:13:33,770
Not every lady I talk to is my girlfriend, bro.

5831
04:13:34,070 --> 04:13:35,090
Oh, that's fucked.

5832
04:13:39,040 --> 04:13:39,600
Okay.

5833
04:13:40,160 --> 04:13:41,120
Let's grab the item.

5834
04:13:45,800 --> 04:13:46,480
Oh, nice.

5835
04:13:46,600 --> 04:13:47,260
Maximum stamina.

5836
04:13:47,580 --> 04:13:48,080
We need that.

5837
04:13:49,660 --> 04:13:50,280
Alright, guys.

5838
04:13:50,300 --> 04:13:50,820
Where do we go?

5839
04:13:51,280 --> 04:13:52,140
Do we go up?

5840
04:13:53,600 --> 04:13:54,980
Oh, now it's personal.

5841
04:13:55,060 --> 04:13:56,020
They're always watching.

5842
04:13:58,180 --> 04:14:02,160
Bro, just cause I had a dream about her, it doesn't mean like we're dating or anything.

5843
04:14:03,800 --> 04:14:07,000
Oh, there's nowhere to go here.

5844
04:14:07,840 --> 04:14:08,280
Nice.

5845
04:14:10,280 --> 04:14:11,240
Wait, that air...

5846
04:14:11,240 --> 04:14:12,000
What the fuck?

5847
04:14:12,020 --> 04:14:15,660
What the fuck were they?

5848
04:14:15,840 --> 04:14:16,840
Okay, that was creepy.

5849
04:14:19,620 --> 04:14:21,280
Okay, that's creepy.

5850
04:14:21,700 --> 04:14:22,880
Oh my god, these...

5851
04:14:22,880 --> 04:14:25,260
They're like the twins from that...

5852
04:14:25,900 --> 04:14:27,400
Stanley Kubrick, The Shining.

5853
04:14:28,700 --> 04:14:30,380
We go up here?

5854
04:14:33,940 --> 04:14:35,040
Equip the Nina.

5855
04:14:39,450 --> 04:14:40,130
This...

5856
04:14:40,130 --> 04:14:40,810
Oh.

5857
04:14:43,470 --> 04:14:44,170
Oh, here.

5858
04:14:45,350 --> 04:14:48,730
Homes in on an attacks highly affected against...

5859
04:14:48,730 --> 04:14:49,350
Oh, this one.

5860
04:14:49,530 --> 04:14:49,910
Okay.

5861
04:14:53,110 --> 04:14:53,990
We go here?

5862
04:14:59,620 --> 04:15:01,660
Is this the final boss here?

5863
04:15:01,960 --> 04:15:02,580
Oh, no.

5864
04:15:02,620 --> 04:15:03,020
It's an item.

5865
04:15:03,920 --> 04:15:05,200
Play with us, Doki.

5866
04:15:10,320 --> 04:15:11,060
Oh, nice.

5867
04:15:22,190 --> 04:15:24,550
A side entrance from the shrine?

5868
04:15:25,390 --> 04:15:26,750
Yeah, but there was another...

5869
04:15:26,750 --> 04:15:28,650
Um, area that I didn't go.

5870
04:15:28,910 --> 04:15:31,370
Uh, when I got the...

5871
04:15:33,710 --> 04:15:34,750
Where was it?

5872
04:15:35,350 --> 04:15:36,230
It's like here?

5873
04:15:37,330 --> 04:15:38,510
How did I get here?

5874
04:15:38,850 --> 04:15:39,790
Oh, there he is.

5875
04:15:40,470 --> 04:15:41,910
Guys, I think that's the boss.

5876
04:15:44,970 --> 04:15:46,030
Guys, I think...

5877
04:15:46,030 --> 04:15:47,930
Guys, does this look like the boss?

5878
04:15:53,370 --> 04:15:56,110
I remember there was like an area that I forgot.

5879
04:15:56,310 --> 04:15:58,750
There was an area that I didn't go to.

5880
04:16:00,350 --> 04:16:04,050
Sorry, it took me a while to get this to hit.

5881
04:16:04,210 --> 04:16:05,570
Oh, it was in the optional area.

5882
04:16:05,930 --> 04:16:06,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5883
04:16:06,590 --> 04:16:07,330
There was a...

5884
04:16:07,330 --> 04:16:08,470
I remember now.

5885
04:16:08,510 --> 04:16:10,090
There was an area in the optional area.

5886
04:16:13,630 --> 04:16:14,710
Guys, do you think like...

5887
04:16:14,710 --> 04:16:15,570
Do you think...

5888
04:16:15,570 --> 04:16:16,810
Do you think they're friendly?

5889
04:16:17,930 --> 04:16:18,170
Hahaha.

5890
04:16:19,990 --> 04:16:21,810
No, there was an area I didn't explore.

5891
04:16:22,090 --> 04:16:23,170
Because I was like confused.

5892
04:16:24,290 --> 04:16:25,290
I was like...

5893
04:16:26,790 --> 04:16:27,590
Somewhere here.

5894
04:16:32,140 --> 04:16:32,820
Let's see.

5895
04:16:33,000 --> 04:16:33,880
It was like...

5896
04:16:33,880 --> 04:16:36,660
Here and then turn left, I think.

5897
04:16:39,060 --> 04:16:39,980
I'm pretty sure.

5898
04:16:40,080 --> 04:16:41,560
I'm pretty sure I didn't explore that, right?

5899
04:16:41,780 --> 04:16:42,660
I don't remember.

5900
04:16:43,800 --> 04:16:44,680
I don't remember.

5901
04:16:44,840 --> 04:16:45,760
There, there, this way, this way.

5902
04:16:45,800 --> 04:16:46,340
I didn't go left.

5903
04:16:46,800 --> 04:16:47,900
Wait, no, not this way.

5904
04:16:47,980 --> 04:16:48,180
Sorry.

5905
04:16:48,180 --> 04:16:49,520
This way.

5906
04:16:49,600 --> 04:16:50,920
I didn't go left.

5907
04:16:51,000 --> 04:16:52,180
Yeah, I didn't go left here.

5908
04:16:57,440 --> 04:16:58,260
I did.

5909
04:16:59,640 --> 04:17:01,720
I am so fucking stupid.

5910
04:17:02,600 --> 04:17:04,440
This is where I came from.

5911
04:17:09,300 --> 04:17:10,060
Oh my god.

5912
04:17:11,700 --> 04:17:13,940
That's literally where I went.

5913
04:17:14,420 --> 04:17:15,280
Oh my god.

5914
04:17:16,400 --> 04:17:16,960
Okay.

5915
04:17:18,560 --> 04:17:20,460
I'm so fucking okay.

5916

Okay.

5917
04:17:21,480 --> 04:17:21,520
Okay.

5918
04:17:21,560 --> 04:17:21,620
Okay.

5919
04:17:21,620 --> 04:17:21,740
Okay.

5920
04:17:21,740 --> 04:17:22,560
Let's go back.

5921
04:17:25,940 --> 04:17:26,380
Okay.

5922
04:17:27,900 --> 04:17:28,780

No.

5928
04:17:36,560 --> 04:17:39,800
I had to go this back because I need to kill the last tiger.

5929
04:17:40,180 --> 04:17:43,440
I need to kill the last tiger and put him out of his misery.

5930
04:17:45,820 --> 04:17:46,260
Okay.

5931
04:17:46,800 --> 04:17:49,260

5932
04:17:49,680 --> 04:17:50,120
Okay.

5933
04:17:50,760 --> 04:17:51,200

Oh, it recovers you to a certain amount of health or... No, we don't need those.

6045
04:22:53,930 --> 04:22:54,610
Alright.

6046
04:22:55,470 --> 04:22:58,270
Wait, do I have a different... Am I not using that?

6047
04:23:09,280 --> 04:23:10,940
Am I on a burn resistance?

6048
04:23:11,480 --> 04:23:12,160
And...

6049
04:23:12,860 --> 04:23:15,400
Why the fuck am I using burn resistance?

6050
04:23:18,040 --> 04:23:18,720
Sorry.

6051
04:23:19,080 --> 04:23:20,840

6053
04:23:24,780 --> 04:23:25,460

04:23:40,960 --> 04:23:42,760
That's such a good question.

04:23:42,820 --> 04:23:43,880
I don't even know.

6059
04:23:44,280 --> 04:23:46,140
I don't even know why.

6060
04:23:51,440 --> 04:23:52,980
Might recovery rate.

6061
04:23:55,920 --> 04:23:57,820
Damage reduction and might recovery.

6062
04:23:58,160 --> 04:23:58,500

04:24:03,420 --> 04:24:04,020
Okay.

6064
04:24:05,800 --> 04:24:08,120
If it heals, it heals.

6065
04:24:08,460 --> 04:24:10,740
I'm just like, when the fuck did that happen?

6066
04:24:16,470 --> 04:24:18,470
And mushroom cap and release spores.

6067
04:24:19,770 --> 04:24:22,290
Spores that can return and recover health.

6068
04:24:23,330 --> 04:24:24,890
Okay guys, which is better?

6069
04:24:25,410 --> 04:24:27,710
We finally leave Big Baby?

6070
04:24:28,650 --> 04:24:31,210
Or do we go with sport Fungi Woman?

6071
04:24:34,910 --> 04:24:39,070
Are we really gonna ditch Big Baby after everything he's done for us?

6072
04:24:39,210 --> 04:24:40,010
Of course not.

6073
04:24:40,790 --> 04:24:42,730
We respect Big Baby.

6074
04:24:45,550 --> 04:24:48,010
Can't believe you guys would suggest a thing.

6075
04:24:48,230 --> 04:24:50,030
I can't believe it, guys.

6076
04:24:50,710 --> 04:24:54,370
Can't believe you guys would wanna ditch Big Baby.

6077
04:24:59,070 --> 04:25:00,430
How could you?

6078
04:25:00,450 --> 04:25:02,670
After everything Big Baby did for us.

6079
04:25:02,870 --> 04:25:04,470
How fucking could you?

6080
04:25:11,900 --> 04:25:12,620

And you wanna leave Big Baby now?

6083
04:25:21,380 --> 04:25:21,980
Okay.

This is here, right?

6085
04:25:24,920 --> 04:25:25,960
Where was I?

6086
04:25:29,540 --> 04:25:31,060
Oh, Court of Illumination.

04:25:38,300 --> 04:25:38,900
Alright,

Fungi has lifesteal.

6091
04:25:49,280 --> 04:25:52,080
But Fungi has never been with us since the beginning.

6092
04:25:52,320 --> 04:25:53,960
It's called Honor Code.

6093
04:25:53,960 --> 04:25:56,080
It's called the Bro Code, guys.

6094
04:25:58,740 --> 04:26:02,520
Big Baby has been there from the very beginning.

6095
04:26:12,460 --> 04:26:14,600
How many polygons is this?

6096
04:26:15,780 --> 04:26:16,940
You don't understand.

6097
04:26:30,020 --> 04:26:45,000
The Is that the master?

6098
04:26:49,980 --> 04:26:53,860
Is that him?

6099
04:26:53,860 --> 04:26:54,060
Is that him?

6100
04:26:54,060 --> 04:26:55,360
Is that the tiger-hater?

6101
04:27:04,740 --> 04:27:06,140
He's gonna kill her!

6102
04:27:10,660 --> 04:27:11,320
Oh!

6103
04:27:12,300 --> 04:27:13,600
It's the relic!

6104
04:27:14,880 --> 04:27:16,560
He's taking the relic back!

6105
04:27:20,760 --> 04:27:21,720
No way!

6106
04:27:21,920 --> 04:27:22,380
No!

6107
04:27:44,660 --> 04:27:45,940
What the fuck is going on?

6108
04:27:47,420 --> 04:27:47,560
Oh my god!

6109
04:27:47,660 --> 04:27:48,440
He was a bug!

6110
04:27:48,520 --> 04:27:49,760
I fucking knew it!

6111
04:27:53,020 --> 04:27:54,340
Fucking knew it!

6112
04:27:54,400 --> 04:27:56,060
That's why he hated tigers!

6113
04:28:01,080 --> 04:28:03,740
The Hundred-Eyed Taoist Master.

6114
04:28:04,260 --> 04:28:06,800
So that's why he was turning all of them into bugs!

6115
04:28:07,380 --> 04:28:10,300
That's his way of impregnating.

6116
04:28:14,420 --> 04:28:15,060
No!

6117
04:28:15,320 --> 04:28:16,120
They're children!

6118
04:28:19,760 --> 04:28:21,100
What the fuck?

6119
04:28:21,120 --> 04:28:21,660
Oh shit!

6120
04:28:21,700 --> 04:28:22,000
Sorry.

6121
04:28:22,120 --> 04:28:22,900
I should help.

6122
04:28:22,940 --> 04:28:23,680
I'm so sorry.

6123
04:28:23,740 --> 04:28:24,400
I should help you.

6124
04:28:27,860 --> 04:28:29,620
Watch the children fight.

6125
04:28:31,200 --> 04:28:32,280
I'm just like...

6126
04:28:32,280 --> 04:28:33,500
Wait, I should be helping.

6127
04:28:37,280 --> 04:28:38,100
I'm sorry.

6128
04:28:38,380 --> 04:28:38,880
I was...

6129
04:28:39,440 --> 04:28:39,880
No!

6130
04:28:39,880 --> 04:28:40,720
They just have a weapon!

6131
04:28:40,740 --> 04:28:41,760
Okay, that's not it.

6132
04:28:41,780 --> 04:28:43,400
I'm not mean to kill multiple monkeys.

6133
04:28:43,780 --> 04:28:45,720
I didn't mean...

6134
04:28:46,540 --> 04:28:47,400
Okay, now we're in trouble.

6135
04:28:47,400 --> 04:28:49,060
We have the mother monkeys and okay.

6136
04:28:49,200 --> 04:28:51,600
Alright, I wasted my mana, but that's okay.

6137
04:28:55,720 --> 04:28:56,380
That's okay.

6138
04:28:59,080 --> 04:29:00,180
Alright, spotters, go!

6139
04:29:00,820 --> 04:29:02,840
Okay, but what happens if like...

6140
04:29:04,280 --> 04:29:06,760
What happens if I die on this run?

6141
04:29:06,900 --> 04:29:09,000
Do I not have the spotters anymore?

6142
04:29:10,580 --> 04:29:11,020
No!

6143
04:29:11,020 --> 04:29:13,020
I didn't want to summon...

6144
04:29:13,020 --> 04:29:14,400
Wait, where are the other spotters?

6145
04:29:15,800 --> 04:29:17,400
What happened to them?

6146
04:29:17,500 --> 04:29:17,620
What happened to them?

6147
04:29:17,620 --> 04:29:18,360
Did they die?

6148
04:29:18,900 --> 04:29:19,320
Bing!

6149
04:29:21,640 --> 04:29:23,500
Like, the fight's not over.

6150
04:29:26,740 --> 04:29:30,140
Like, the fight's not over.

6151
04:29:30,580 --> 04:29:33,640
Why did they leave?

6152
04:29:33,820 --> 04:29:36,660
I wasn't even part of this fight.

6153
04:29:37,020 --> 04:29:42,640
I don't understand why they left.

6154
04:29:42,980 --> 04:29:43,260
I don't understand why they left.

6155
04:29:43,260 --> 04:29:45,820
We weren't even originally part of this fight.

6156
04:29:46,000 --> 04:29:48,080
So like, there's no reason...

6157
04:29:48,080 --> 04:29:48,780
Why did they leave?

6158
04:29:49,040 --> 04:29:53,920
Like I wasn't... Okay, this does not make sense.

6159
04:29:54,140 --> 04:29:55,500
Why did they go home?

6160
04:29:56,260 --> 04:29:57,660
Why did they leave?

6161
04:30:00,340 --> 04:30:01,880
Why did they leave?

6162
04:30:04,440 --> 04:30:05,820
Wait, they fell.

6163
04:30:05,860 --> 04:30:07,140
You had it Adam!

6164
04:30:07,180 --> 04:30:08,960
This was their fight!

6165
04:30:09,660 --> 04:30:11,280
Like, that's the thing!

6166
04:30:11,560 --> 04:30:13,760
This was literally their fight!

6167
04:30:14,300 --> 04:30:16,640
I was just like a bystanding.

6168
04:30:18,340 --> 04:30:19,500
Oh shit!

6169
04:30:20,460 --> 04:30:21,860
I need to hydrate.

6170
04:30:22,100 --> 04:30:23,480
I need to hydrate.

6171
04:30:24,040 --> 04:30:24,640
Okay.

6172
04:30:29,340 --> 04:30:32,840
Like literally not even part of the scenario.

6173
04:30:33,620 --> 04:30:35,180
Not even part of this.

6174
04:30:37,300 --> 04:30:40,380
Okay, I don't know his pattern so like I'm a little bit...

6175
04:30:40,380 --> 04:30:42,100
Oh my god!

6176
04:30:45,240 --> 04:30:46,520
Holy shit, okay!

6177
04:30:47,120 --> 04:30:48,240
Can he hydrate?

6178
04:30:51,800 --> 04:30:53,700
To be fair, he has your stuff.

6179
04:30:53,840 --> 04:30:54,920
Yeah, but like...

6180
04:30:55,540 --> 04:30:57,220
They should be mad at...

6181
04:30:57,820 --> 04:30:59,520
Mad at him, not me!

6182
04:30:59,700 --> 04:31:02,680
Like I said, like I literally just showed up!

6183
04:31:04,820 --> 04:31:07,080
Like they did this stuff with their mom, not me!

6184
04:31:11,460 --> 04:31:14,080
This was like a fight related to their mom!

6185
04:31:16,240 --> 04:31:17,180
Oh shit, okay.

6186
04:31:18,160 --> 04:31:19,580
I should hydrate though.

6187
04:31:20,120 --> 04:31:20,820
Hydrate time!

6188
04:31:24,040 --> 04:31:24,840
Oh shit!

6189
04:31:25,020 --> 04:31:25,640
Oh my god!

6190
04:31:25,700 --> 04:31:26,240
Oh, that's bad!

6191
04:31:26,860 --> 04:31:27,620
This is bad!

6192
04:31:29,000 --> 04:31:29,760
Okay, nice!

6193
04:31:29,880 --> 04:31:31,500
Okay, not as bad as I thought.

6194
04:31:32,360 --> 04:31:33,140
Alright, nice!

6195
04:31:33,880 --> 04:31:35,400
I'm just gonna hydrate again.

6196
04:31:36,380 --> 04:31:37,220
Just in case.

6197
04:31:40,400 --> 04:31:40,880
Okay!

6198
04:31:41,600 --> 04:31:42,620
Time to leave!

6199
04:31:43,620 --> 04:31:44,100
Okay!

6200
04:31:45,480 --> 04:31:46,500
Time to leave!

6201
04:31:46,800 --> 04:31:47,140
Whoa!

6202
04:31:48,360 --> 04:31:49,460
What is he doing?

6203
04:31:49,520 --> 04:31:50,000
What is he doing?

6204
04:31:50,040 --> 04:31:50,780
I don't know what this is!

6205
04:31:51,000 --> 04:31:51,040
Oh!

6206
04:31:51,340 --> 04:31:52,440
I don't know what this is!

6207
04:31:53,100 --> 04:31:54,000
Is this this?

6208
04:31:55,840 --> 04:31:56,860
Is that what it does?

6209
04:32:00,480 --> 04:32:01,080
The needle.

6210
04:32:01,200 --> 04:32:01,480
Okay.

6211
04:32:02,180 --> 04:32:02,580
Okay.

6212
04:32:02,700 --> 04:32:03,080
Nice.

6213
04:32:03,380 --> 04:32:04,080
I remembered.

6214
04:32:05,740 --> 04:32:09,260
I remembered you guys saying you see a lot of balls, just needle.

6215
04:32:10,140 --> 04:32:10,820
I read.

6216
04:32:16,140 --> 04:32:16,760
What the fuck?

6217
04:32:16,800 --> 04:32:17,020
What?

6218
04:32:17,160 --> 04:32:17,900
What is he doing?

6219
04:32:17,900 --> 04:32:19,020
What are you doing?

6220
04:32:22,440 --> 04:32:24,280
I'm so sad.

6221
04:32:24,500 --> 04:32:25,260
I'm...

6222
04:32:25,260 --> 04:32:26,040
Okay, goodbye.

6223
04:32:27,780 --> 04:32:28,180
Okay.

6224
04:32:28,780 --> 04:32:29,460
I'm...

6225
04:32:29,460 --> 04:32:30,900
Okay.

6226
04:32:36,500 --> 04:32:37,300
Hydrate.

6227
04:32:38,940 --> 04:32:39,740
Hydrate.

6228
04:32:40,800 --> 04:32:43,260
Just gotta hydrate, I guess.

6229
04:32:46,700 --> 04:32:49,180
What else would I do but hydrate?

6230
04:32:50,520 --> 04:32:51,100
Okay.

6231
04:32:54,820 --> 04:32:55,860
Oh, shit!

6232
04:32:56,020 --> 04:32:56,860
Oh, hydrate!

6233
04:32:56,960 --> 04:32:57,360
Hydrate!

6234
04:32:58,220 --> 04:32:58,800
Hydrate!

6235
04:33:02,020 --> 04:33:02,600
Oh!

6236
04:33:03,160 --> 04:33:03,740
Whoa!

6237
04:33:05,540 --> 04:33:06,420
Okay, nice.

6238
04:33:06,980 --> 04:33:07,860
I did it.

6239
04:33:08,200 --> 04:33:09,160
I didn't die.

6240
04:33:09,220 --> 04:33:09,560
That's good.

6241
04:33:11,200 --> 04:33:12,360
Jesus Christ.

6242
04:33:12,660 --> 04:33:13,240
Oh, my God.

6243
04:33:13,240 --> 04:33:14,600
He does so much.

6244
04:33:15,180 --> 04:33:15,920
Oh, God.

6245
04:33:15,980 --> 04:33:16,160
Okay.

6246
04:33:18,440 --> 04:33:19,480
Oh, shit!

6247
04:33:19,560 --> 04:33:20,720
Okay, that's fine.

6248
04:33:23,960 --> 04:33:24,720
It's fine.

6249
04:33:26,940 --> 04:33:29,140
Oh, my God, that's not final flight.

6250
04:33:31,260 --> 04:33:40,120
Oh, he does this thing and I don't know what it does, but he does it and it scares me..

6251
04:33:43,700 --> 04:33:46,400
Did I do any damage to him?

6252
04:33:46,740 --> 04:33:48,140
I can't tell!

6253
04:33:54,240 --> 04:33:54,840
Okay...

6254
04:33:57,840 --> 04:33:58,440
Okay...

6255
04:33:59,380 --> 04:34:01,280
What the fuck was-

6256
04:34:06,580 --> 04:34:07,740
Boom!

6257
04:34:07,820 --> 04:34:08,360
Okay.

6258
04:34:12,790 --> 04:34:16,790
I'm just gonna do one less hydrate for now, before I hit him on his legs.

6259
04:34:16,790 --> 04:34:18,370
Oh yeah!

6260
04:34:20,570 --> 04:34:21,950
No, no, no, no, no, no!

6261
04:34:26,650 --> 04:34:26,990
No!

6262
04:34:29,670 --> 04:34:30,070
Yeah.

6263
04:34:32,670 --> 04:34:34,290
I swear to god!

6264
04:34:36,650 --> 04:34:38,290
Now that he grabbed me!

6265
04:34:38,490 --> 04:34:40,130
I can never die!

6266
04:34:41,310 --> 04:34:44,610
Holy shit, he's so fucking light!

6267
04:34:48,940 --> 04:34:49,840
Oh no.

6268
04:34:54,440 --> 04:34:56,440
Oh god, grab him!

6269
04:35:00,700 --> 04:35:01,300
Granny!

6270
04:35:07,060 --> 04:35:08,580
Wait, she absorbed him?

6271
04:35:08,840 --> 04:35:09,820
He absorbed her?

6272
04:35:18,640 --> 04:35:19,700
Is she dying?

6273
04:35:21,340 --> 04:35:23,380
She's like, 500 years old.

6274
04:35:23,500 --> 04:35:24,720
It's her time.

6275
04:35:27,980 --> 04:35:29,120
Cold, she is.

6276
04:35:38,220 --> 04:35:39,460
Now they come back!

6277
04:35:39,620 --> 04:35:39,820
Yeah!

6278
04:35:39,920 --> 04:35:40,880
Now they come back!

6279
04:35:45,140 --> 04:35:46,260
That's your child.

6280
04:35:46,600 --> 04:35:49,260
Remember your life support- your child support, Pigsy.

6281
04:35:58,870 --> 04:36:00,390
Where did he come from?

6282
04:36:06,140 --> 04:36:08,040
She's like, my pig's a dad.

6283
04:36:08,360 --> 04:36:10,500
My dad's a- my dad's a pig.

6284
04:36:12,580 --> 04:36:17,160
She's like, I'm not a pig.

6285
04:36:17,440 --> 04:36:19,580
Don't be a dead諜.

6286
04:36:19,900 --> 04:36:22,680
Go to her A!

6287
04:36:26,150 --> 04:36:26,650
Don't be a dead beat!

6288
04:36:26,650 --> 04:36:27,730
Or I'll skin you alive!

6289
04:36:28,410 --> 04:36:29,790
You fuck!

6290
04:36:36,320 --> 04:36:37,700
Bro...

6291
04:36:39,250 --> 04:36:44,460
After all those rounds?!

6292
04:36:49,400 --> 04:36:50,240
Bro...

6293
04:37:08,270 --> 04:37:08,710
Damn.

6294
04:37:25,680 --> 04:37:26,920
Is that her?

6295
04:37:28,700 --> 04:37:29,660
Is that her?

6296
04:37:29,860 --> 04:37:30,520
The spider?

6297
04:37:32,040 --> 04:37:35,920
No, this is... No, this is based off of...

6298
04:37:35,920 --> 04:37:40,280
No, it's based off of the Moon Festival, right?

6299
04:37:45,040 --> 04:37:46,640
Yeah, the Moon Goddess.

6300
04:37:47,680 --> 04:37:51,560
Yeah, I saw the moon and I was like, oh, the rabbit ears.

6301
04:37:53,160 --> 04:37:53,460
That's her.

6302
04:37:55,400 --> 04:37:56,260
You'll never find them.

6303
04:38:34,880 --> 04:38:36,240
I love the animation.

6304
04:38:37,020 --> 04:38:37,240
But I don't know what...

6305
04:38:37,240 --> 04:38:37,260
I love the animation.

6306
04:38:37,260 --> 04:38:38,060
But I don't know what...

6307
04:38:39,220 --> 04:38:41,120
But I don't know what...

6308
04:38:46,410 --> 04:38:47,130
Oh!

6309
04:38:49,170 --> 04:38:51,970
He got cursed because he hit on her.

6310
04:38:54,130 --> 04:38:54,850
Oh!

6311
04:39:27,690 --> 04:39:29,630
God damn it, Pigsy.

6312
04:39:35,030 --> 04:39:36,270
God damn it.

6313
04:39:39,930 --> 04:39:40,770
Bro.

6314
04:39:45,730 --> 04:39:46,570
Yeah.

6315
04:39:48,790 --> 04:39:49,970
Bro, did she?

6316
04:39:50,350 --> 04:39:51,090
Bro!

6317
04:39:51,730 --> 04:39:53,890
Did she?

6318
04:39:54,190 --> 04:39:54,970
Okay.

6319
04:39:55,590 --> 04:39:57,710
That was like the catfish.

6320
04:39:57,770 --> 04:39:58,210
Okay.

6321
04:40:03,210 --> 04:40:04,650
It's not so bad.

6322
04:40:05,830 --> 04:40:07,330
The spider and the pig.

6323
04:40:07,490 --> 04:40:07,790
Okay.

6324
04:40:11,650 --> 04:40:13,470
Oh, fuck you.

6325
04:40:13,950 --> 04:40:15,590
Holy shit.

6326
04:40:18,510 --> 04:40:19,350
Oh.

6327
04:40:25,990 --> 04:40:26,830
Oh.

6328
04:40:37,020 --> 04:40:39,380
He spent so many years together.

6329
04:40:55,150 --> 04:40:56,590
Then he chose the...

6330
04:40:56,830 --> 04:40:57,190
Bro!

6331
04:40:59,830 --> 04:41:01,170
He left her.

6332
04:41:01,870 --> 04:41:03,530
For the bros.

6333
04:41:05,290 --> 04:41:06,110
That's right.

6334
04:41:06,350 --> 04:41:07,130
Bros before...

6335
04:41:07,130 --> 04:41:08,510
No, I'm just joking.

6336
04:41:08,550 --> 04:41:08,950
No.

6337
04:41:08,990 --> 04:41:10,210
That's sad for her.

6338
04:41:11,310 --> 04:41:13,130
That's for my own...

6339
04:41:13,870 --> 04:41:17,050
He chose the monkey.

6340
04:41:18,130 --> 04:41:18,350
No.

6341
04:41:20,430 --> 04:41:21,730
For the bros.

6342
04:41:24,750 --> 04:41:26,470
Yeah, I remember they killed all the sisters.

6343
04:41:26,810 --> 04:41:26,970
Yeah.

6344
04:41:34,490 --> 04:41:35,370
I remember.

6345
04:41:36,470 --> 04:41:37,350
It's like...

6346
04:41:41,550 --> 04:41:41,990
Yeah,

6347
04:41:45,970 --> 04:41:46,350
it's funny.

6348
04:41:46,530 --> 04:41:48,030
Like, yeah, they killed all of their sisters.

6349
04:41:48,030 --> 04:41:50,830
People always make, like, adaptations where they get...

6350
04:41:50,830 --> 04:41:53,610
The spiders get revenge on them for that.

6351
04:41:56,390 --> 04:41:58,810
You're expecting you to cry, but you laugh.

6352
04:41:58,910 --> 04:42:00,150
That's so fucked up.

6353
04:42:00,790 --> 04:42:02,230
Zafirman, thank you for the super chat.

6354
04:42:02,310 --> 04:42:02,570
Thank you.

Thank you.

6356
04:42:02,990 --> 04:42:07,890
I did not realize because, like, our whole thing today on this stream was like, bro, guys.

6357
04:42:08,170 --> 04:42:09,470
Bros before hoes, guys.

6358
04:42:09,690 --> 04:42:10,430
And he literally...

6359
04:42:10,430 --> 04:42:12,030
He literally bros before hoder.

6360
04:42:20,060 --> 04:42:21,700
Friendship ended with birds and bees.

6361
04:42:21,780 --> 04:42:23,380
And aggi, he's only pigs and spiders now.

6362
04:42:23,620 --> 04:42:25,100
Well, thank you for the super chat.

6363
04:42:25,200 --> 04:42:25,500
Thank you.

6364
04:42:25,500 --> 04:42:26,280
Thank you, bro.

6365
04:42:30,730 --> 04:42:32,390
I can't believe it, bro.

6366
04:42:34,250 --> 04:42:36,350
You had so many children.

6367
04:42:36,850 --> 04:42:38,550
Wait, then they're all his.

6368
04:42:40,950 --> 04:42:46,370
Qingsi bu zhan.衹怕封了靜潭使者 ,也是俗人一个.

6369
04:42:47,310 --> 04:42:57,610
From the epic leader of Tianhe, from the official leader of Tianpeng, to the Zhugeli to Qujing's The majority of them were his.

6370
04:42:57,950 --> 04:43:00,570
Bro, they were banging for a long time.

6371
04:43:10,040 --> 04:43:11,100
Who's the chicken?

6372
04:43:11,420 --> 04:43:12,880
Oh, the chicken!

6373
04:43:13,100 --> 04:43:14,580
That's the guy we killed.

6374
04:43:36,800 --> 04:43:38,780
Oh, those guys.

6375
04:43:39,860 --> 04:43:41,440
The court, from the high court.

6376
04:44:04,610 --> 04:44:05,090
Alright.

6377
04:44:06,450 --> 04:44:07,510
Did I miss anything?

6378
04:44:11,520 --> 04:44:13,820
I love the artwork they do for this too.

6379
04:44:15,120 --> 04:44:17,100
Oh, that's the centipede, the hundred eyes.

6380
04:44:22,660 --> 04:44:26,460
All my homies hate the celestial court, true.

6381
04:44:50,520 --> 04:44:51,320
Alright.

6382
04:44:51,640 --> 04:44:55,120
Well, he chose us.

6383
04:44:55,360 --> 04:44:57,220
So who's the real winner?

6384
04:44:59,380 --> 04:45:00,640
Not her.

6385
04:45:01,420 --> 04:45:06,800
Look, he can find many spider ladies, but he can only find one.

6386
04:45:06,800 --> 04:45:08,400
One group of bros.

6387
04:45:08,420 --> 04:45:09,700
No!

6388
04:45:10,820 --> 04:45:12,180
Toki, please!

6389
04:45:19,280 --> 04:45:23,420
Okay, next chapter.

6390
04:45:23,720 --> 04:45:25,740
Spiders have a lot of fucking kids!

6391
04:45:25,980 --> 04:45:27,920
Okay, but a group of bros?

6392
04:45:27,980 --> 04:45:28,820
That's forever.

6393
04:45:29,460 --> 04:45:31,000
Alright, next chapter.

6394
04:45:36,880 --> 04:45:37,980
Chapter five.

6395
04:45:38,100 --> 04:45:40,000
Golden child, crimson blood.

6396
04:45:41,640 --> 04:45:42,460
What happened?

6397
04:45:42,480 --> 04:45:43,100
Did I miss the spider?

6398
04:45:43,200 --> 04:45:43,420
No!

6399
04:45:44,020 --> 04:45:44,660
Fuck, oops.

6400
04:45:48,870 --> 04:45:50,150
Nice work, Toki.

6401
04:45:50,190 --> 04:45:51,250
The last boss, second phase.

6402
04:45:51,430 --> 04:45:52,670
I learned the hard way.

6403
04:45:52,830 --> 04:45:53,670
Have fun, next chapter.

6404
04:45:53,690 --> 04:45:54,550
Thank you for the super chat.

04:45:54,670 --> 04:45:55,350
Thank you, thank you.

6406
04:45:55,690 --> 04:45:59,170
I'm just gonna look at the intro, and then we'll see how I feel here.

6407
04:46:04,960 --> 04:46:06,020
What the fuck?

6408
04:46:07,060 --> 04:46:08,300
Is this zombie land?

6409
04:46:14,420 --> 04:46:15,340
What is this?

6410
04:46:21,140 --> 04:46:21,900
What are they?

6411
04:46:21,900 --> 04:46:22,040
Hey.

6412
04:46:23,260 --> 04:46:24,580
Woods of ember.

6413
04:46:29,730 --> 04:46:30,610
Oh, shit.

6414
04:46:58,160 --> 04:46:59,180
Wait, they're not dead?

6415
04:46:59,460 --> 04:47:00,720
Wait, they are zombies then.

6416
04:47:04,560 --> 04:47:05,280
Oh, shit.

6417
04:47:05,900 --> 04:47:06,840
Wait, is that...

6418
04:47:06,840 --> 04:47:08,240
Is he gonna be like that forever?

6419
04:47:08,720 --> 04:47:09,180
Like...

6420
04:47:10,300 --> 04:47:11,460
Oh, shit!

6421
04:47:12,020 --> 04:47:14,140
Is Pixie gonna be like that forever now?

6422
04:47:17,900 --> 04:47:19,240
Okay, give me a sec, Pixie.

6423
04:47:19,240 --> 04:47:20,140
I'm heading over.

6424
04:47:20,420 --> 04:47:22,880
My hands were on the wrong...

6425
04:47:22,880 --> 04:47:24,020
Okay, now that makes sense.

6426
04:47:24,680 --> 04:47:27,860
I had my hands... I moved my hands to the right.

6427
04:47:32,920 --> 04:47:34,980
Is that in combat mode now?

6428
04:47:37,400 --> 04:47:38,220
Oh, ow.

6429
04:47:39,020 --> 04:47:39,500
Okay.

6430
04:47:41,360 --> 04:47:42,560
They're dead, they're dead.

6431
04:47:43,080 --> 04:47:44,180
Oh, they're not dead.

6432
04:47:44,300 --> 04:47:45,120
Oh, there's a lot more.

6433
04:47:45,240 --> 04:47:45,880
Okay, never mind.

6434
04:47:45,880 --> 04:47:47,780
I was like, what are you doing?

6435
04:47:47,860 --> 04:47:48,200
It's over.

6436
04:47:48,340 --> 04:47:49,240
Oh my god!

6437
04:47:49,340 --> 04:47:51,280
You don't even do any damage!

6438
04:47:53,420 --> 04:47:54,540
You barely...

6439
04:47:54,540 --> 04:47:56,960
You better off as a smaller pig.

6440
04:47:57,060 --> 04:47:58,120
Not gonna lie.

6441
04:48:00,920 --> 04:48:05,460
Okay, I feel like he does more damage when he's in this small form.

6442
04:48:06,800 --> 04:48:08,280
The jump was cool though.

6443
04:48:18,640 --> 04:48:21,280
And here comes Pixie with the steel chair!

6444
04:48:23,980 --> 04:48:26,920
Oh, you did like 0.1 damage.

6445
04:48:27,480 --> 04:48:28,240
Oh, you did like 0.1 damage.

6446
04:48:28,760 --> 04:48:29,360
Whoa!

6447
04:48:30,500 --> 04:48:31,740
It is zombies!

6448
04:48:32,280 --> 04:48:33,080
They reanimate!

6449
04:48:34,420 --> 04:48:35,300
Or combine?

6450
04:48:41,190 --> 04:48:42,490
Yoki, he literally lost his wife.

6451
04:48:45,830 --> 04:48:47,510
Yoki, he literally lost his wife.

6452
04:48:49,470 --> 04:48:50,770
Please let him go.

6453
04:48:54,710 --> 04:48:55,650
Yoki, please.

6454
04:48:55,650 --> 04:48:56,690
He lost his wife.

6455
04:48:59,630 --> 04:49:00,170
Alright.

6456
04:49:01,650 --> 04:49:02,590
Where do I...

6457
04:49:02,590 --> 04:49:03,470
Do I go straight?

6458
04:49:03,710 --> 04:49:04,730
I assume I go straight.

6459
04:49:05,330 --> 04:49:06,430
I don't need a shrine.

6460
04:49:11,890 --> 04:49:13,090
Alright, open up.

6461
04:49:13,150 --> 04:49:13,630
Knock, knock!

6462
04:49:21,200 --> 04:49:21,740
Alright.

6463
04:49:22,600 --> 04:49:23,140
Whoa!

6464
04:49:23,740 --> 04:49:24,820
What is that?

6465
04:49:26,800 --> 04:49:27,900
What the fuck is that?

6466
04:49:28,420 --> 04:49:29,540
What are you?

6467
04:49:30,440 --> 04:49:31,220
Oh, shit!

6468
04:49:31,560 --> 04:49:32,440
Guys, please.

6469
04:49:32,500 --> 04:49:33,960
One at a time, guys.

6470
04:49:35,360 --> 04:49:36,400
One at a...

6471
04:49:36,400 --> 04:49:37,480
Okay, guys.

6472
04:49:37,760 --> 04:49:40,480
We do it in an order, everybody.

6473
04:49:43,000 --> 04:49:44,700
This has to be an order.

6474
04:49:45,700 --> 04:49:47,700
A nice, fashionable order.

6475
04:49:48,360 --> 04:49:49,560
Okay, what is this?

6476
04:49:50,480 --> 04:49:52,280
Oh, I forgot like they...

6477
04:49:53,120 --> 04:49:54,060
Oh, here you go.

6478
04:49:54,180 --> 04:49:54,580
Nice.

6479
04:49:55,020 --> 04:49:56,360
Everyone take a number.

6480
04:49:59,960 --> 04:50:00,440
Alright.

6481
04:50:00,480 --> 04:50:00,520
Alright.

6482
04:50:00,520 --> 04:50:04,720
I remember somebody said to go back to a chapter for a secret boss.

6483
04:50:04,900 --> 04:50:07,320
Is that true or were you guys fucking with me?

6484
04:50:07,520 --> 04:50:10,800
I don't know if that was true or not.

6485
04:50:13,180 --> 04:50:13,660
Okay.

6486
04:50:14,160 --> 04:50:15,820
I'm just trying to see if there's...

6487
04:50:15,820 --> 04:50:17,200
90%?

6488
04:50:17,260 --> 04:50:18,400
That shit's nothing.

6489
04:50:21,460 --> 04:50:22,560
Should I craft this?

6490
04:50:22,600 --> 04:50:24,600
Just to see if there's like stuff over there?

6491
04:50:24,880 --> 04:50:25,640
Not yet?

6492
04:50:28,620 --> 04:50:30,840
I just complete the...

6493
04:50:31,660 --> 04:50:36,520
I need to complete a secret zone in chapter 5 first.

6494
04:50:37,460 --> 04:50:38,060
Okay.

6495
04:50:38,540 --> 04:50:38,840
Alright.

6496
04:50:39,520 --> 04:50:41,640
Then we're gonna call it here.

6497
04:50:42,420 --> 04:50:43,800
We're gonna call it here.

6498
04:50:43,840 --> 04:50:45,320
I'll craft some armor first too.

6499
04:50:45,460 --> 04:50:48,160
Might as well so I don't forget to do that later.

6500
04:50:48,440 --> 04:50:54,040
So I should craft this so future Doki doesn't forget.

6501
04:50:54,520 --> 04:50:55,120
Alright.

6502
04:50:55,200 --> 04:50:55,960
Oh, nice.

6503
04:50:56,140 --> 04:50:56,540
Whoa.

6504
04:50:57,840 --> 04:50:58,400
Okay.

6505
04:50:58,500 --> 04:51:00,740
Cause I know future Doki's definitely gonna forget.

6506
04:51:03,860 --> 04:51:04,420
Alright.

6507
04:51:04,700 --> 04:51:07,360
So then we'll put this on.

6508
04:51:07,580 --> 04:51:08,060
Nice.

6509
04:51:08,080 --> 04:51:10,640
Poison resistance on the land of fire.

6510
04:51:11,700 --> 04:51:12,820
That's counterintuitive.

6511
04:51:12,820 --> 04:51:15,360
But like, welcome to life, baby.

6512
04:51:15,880 --> 04:51:16,440
Alright!

6513
04:51:16,680 --> 04:51:18,000
We're gonna call it here.

6514
04:51:18,160 --> 04:51:19,100
We made a lot of progress.

6515
04:51:19,380 --> 04:51:22,580
I mean, 5 hours to finish this chapter.

6516
04:51:22,860 --> 04:51:24,020
So, yeah.

6517
04:51:25,160 --> 04:51:26,780
That's good enough for me.

6518
04:51:26,800 --> 04:51:27,740
Not gonna lie.

6519
04:51:28,960 --> 04:51:30,180
Alright, let me...

6520
04:51:30,800 --> 04:51:31,600
Alright.

6521
04:51:33,240 --> 04:51:34,120
Oh!

6522
04:51:34,680 --> 04:51:38,100
That was really fun!

6523
04:51:38,700 --> 04:51:40,180
That was really fun!

6524
04:51:40,440 --> 04:51:44,100
I had a great time.

6525
04:51:45,220 --> 04:51:55,260
And it has been really, really, really It's been a really fun time.

6526
04:51:55,420 --> 04:51:59,220
Just playing the next...going back to Wukong.

6527
04:51:59,540 --> 04:52:02,820
And completing the chapter finally!

6528
04:52:03,380 --> 04:52:03,940
Completing!

6529
04:52:04,420 --> 04:52:05,700
Completing the bug chapter.

6530
04:52:05,840 --> 04:52:07,600
We're so close to finishing the game.

6531
04:52:07,800 --> 04:52:08,840
We're so close.

6532
04:52:09,080 --> 04:52:12,500
I think we have two more chapters left to go.

6533
04:52:12,740 --> 04:52:14,640
So, how long is chapter 5 anyway?

6534
04:52:15,120 --> 04:52:17,300
How long is chapter 5, guys?

6535
04:52:18,560 --> 04:52:23,900
I'd stream longer, but this week is super packed with a lot of responsibility.

6536
04:52:24,040 --> 04:52:25,520
With a lot of stuff going on.

6537
04:52:25,720 --> 04:52:26,620
So I guess...

6538
04:52:26,800 --> 04:52:27,740
I would love to...

6539
04:52:27,740 --> 04:52:28,160
Oh my gosh.

6540
04:52:28,200 --> 04:52:30,800
I would love to...

6541
04:52:33,300 --> 04:52:40,260
I would love to play a lot more, but I want to make sure I don't go overboard and that I don't lose my voice.

6542
04:52:40,300 --> 04:52:43,600
So that's why I have to make sure I don't overdo it today.

6543
04:52:44,560 --> 04:52:45,240
But yeah!

6544
04:52:45,780 --> 04:52:47,140
Thank you everybody for coming!

6545
04:52:47,440 --> 04:52:49,360
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

6546
04:52:50,020 --> 04:52:52,800
I might put my schedule out today.

6547
04:52:53,680 --> 04:52:56,780
The sponsor stuff hasn't been fully confirmed yet.

6548
04:52:56,800 --> 04:53:00,340
So I'm just going to put sponsor special stream on that day.

6549
04:53:00,420 --> 04:53:02,800
And if it doesn't get confirmed, then that's going to be a rest day.

6550
04:53:03,560 --> 04:53:04,220
But yes!

6551
04:53:04,840 --> 04:53:07,220
A lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.

6552
04:53:07,280 --> 04:53:08,700
A lot of stuff going on this week.

6553
04:53:09,100 --> 04:53:11,020
But I hope you guys had a great time watching.

6554
04:53:11,180 --> 04:53:12,380
I always love streaming for you guys.

6555
04:53:12,520 --> 04:53:18,320
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing!

6556
04:53:18,500 --> 04:53:20,520
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed!

6557
04:53:20,660 --> 04:53:22,020
Because you deserve it!

6558
04:53:22,200 --> 04:53:23,300
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

6559
04:53:24,040 --> 04:53:24,980
Bye-bye guys!

6560
04:53:25,320 --> 04:53:25,900
Bye-bye!
