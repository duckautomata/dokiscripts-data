1
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,800
Oh, you guys.

2
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,820
I'm so fucked right now.

3
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,380
Oh my god.

4
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,360
Okay, I'll tell you what.

5
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,740
I am going through some fumes right now.

6
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,880
Because if anybody fucked up right now, it's me.

7
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,840
Because I am fucking crazy.

8
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,580
Let me get some lo-fi.

9
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,040
Lo-fi copy, right?

10
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,580
Free.

11
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,020
First, let's get some lo-fi in there before we start anything.

12
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,500
Lo-fi!

13
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,340
No copyright!

14
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,820
Okay, but is this the one with...

15
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,700
Alright, let's see.

16
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,060
No, I don't trust that playlist.

17
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,860
There's like... Okay, I write down like lo-fi, no copyright.

18
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,220
And then like sometimes they give me lo-fi playlists that does have copyright.

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,900
Which is very fucked because it's like false advertising.

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,720
Okay, so I'm running with no coffee right now or tea or anything.

21
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,960
No caffeine at all.

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,020
Because I have no caffeine.

23
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,040
I have no caffeine at all in my old apartment.

24
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,220
Which is not good.

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,940
It is not good at all.

26
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,320
So, we're sort of gonna be roughing it right now.

27
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,440
We're gonna be doing our fucking best.

28
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,660
We're gonna fucking try and survive.

29
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,160
So, how can you live like that?

30
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,020
Because all my tea is in my new apartment and not at my old apartment.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
So, I have no tea right now.

32
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,900
And then I thought I had... I mean, I have coffee.

33
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,540
But it's like an open can of coffee that I opened three weeks ago.

34
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,840
So, I don't know.

35
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,480
Don't really want to...

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,880
I don't really want to drink coffee that was open three weeks ago.

37
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,520
It's canned coffee, by the way.

38
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,320
It's not like hot coffee that's been left out for three weeks.

39
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,900
But it's canned coffee that's been out for three weeks in the fridge.

40
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,420
It's been in the fridge for three weeks right now.

41
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,960
So, like, I do not want to drink that.

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,680
No, because thank you for the super chat.

43
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:15,940
Thank you.

44
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,400
Thank you.

45
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,080
Alright, let me tell you how I fucked up my schedule.

46
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,340
So, I had Anime Revolution yesterday.

47
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,140
And I had Anime Revolution today.

48
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,140
And I have Anime Flan tomorrow.

49
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,380
I knew I might have fucked up.

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,000
Past Doki was like, future Doki can do this.

51
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,900
What's the worst thing that could happen?

52
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,660
Having two conventions back to back.

53
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,160
What's the worst thing that could happen?

54
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,900
Well, current Doki realized that there's a lot of things that could happen.

55
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,040
So, basically...

56
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,180
Basically, I had a very late night concert with Mint.

57
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,880
And then, from there, I had the meet and greets.

58
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,540
Yeah?

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,300
So, by that time, I finished around 11ish PM.

60
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,820
11 PM to...

61
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,800
11 PM, almost close to 12 PM.

62
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,300
I don't really remember exactly the time of everything.

63
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,780
And then...

64
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,100
And then, after that, I had stayed up to finish some work stuff.

65
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,220
And then, after that, I had to take a public transport all the way back to my new apartment.

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,820
Because I didn't want to pay an Uber.

67
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,700
I...

68
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,240
I did not.

69
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,180
I already...

70
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,940
Like I said, I already used up a lot of money.

71
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,680
Moving and, like, Ubering and food.

72
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,360
So, like, I haven't bought groceries yet at my new apartment or anything.

73
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,500
So, I've been...

74
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,780
Money...

75
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,320
I gotta cut corners when I can.

76
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,780
I really...

77
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,980
I really do.

78
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,560
Like, I know, like, I make more money than I did before.

79
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,280
But, like, I still...

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,760
It still hurt, you know?

81
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,180
It still...

82
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,520
It still...

83
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,200
It still hurt.

84
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,440
So...

85
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,940
So, basically...

86
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,440
I got home at my new apartment.

87
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,160
Which has nothing, by the way.

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,900
You might think there's an echo here right now.

89
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,040
But, like, at my new place, it's, like...

90
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,180
It's, like, echoing a lot.

91
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,020
So, like, this is also echoing a lot as well.

92
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,700
So...

93
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,860
So, there's, like...

94
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,340
By the way, I have zero furniture.

95
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,960
Zero furniture.

96
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,400
Other than my work desk.

97
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,720
My work desk.

98
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,200
And, like, one chair.

99
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,900
Wait, no.

100
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,780
Two chairs.

101
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,160
Including my work chair.

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,400
That's literally...

103
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,480
That's literally...

104
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,300
And my bed.

105
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,360
And my bed.

106
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,420
I don't have a couch.

107
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,940
I don't think I want...

108
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,180
Guys.

109
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,640
Okay.

110
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,260
I'll explain how this is gonna work later.

111
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,180
But I need to tell my day.

112
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,520
Okay?

113
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,780
I need to let out some steam about my...

114
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,820
I'm also, like, leaning back.

115
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,500
Okay.

116
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:05,960
There you go.

117
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,680
If you feel like I'm, like, really far...

118
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Because I was leaning back on...

119
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,640
Now I'm being dokey.

120
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,380
So...

121
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,360
So, basically...

122
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,660
I got home at around, like, 1ish AM.

123
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,800
And I went to bed.

124
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,780
I went to sleep instantly.

125
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,820
Because...

126
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Because...

127
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,120
I...

128
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,140
Today...

129
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,180
My day started at 7 in the morning.

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,800
And, like, it was so funny.

131
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,920
Because my panel is at 10 in the morning.

132
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,100
And then the dragoons there at Anime Revolution was like, yeah, it's so early.

133
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,140
I never expected your panel to be that early.

134
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,920
And I was like, it was not a choice.

135
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:40,780
Hahaha.

136
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,020
I was just like...

137
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,120
I was like, I would never pick 10 AM for anything.

138
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,280
Hahaha!

139
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,920
It was not a choice.

140
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,980
It was!

141
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,040
Hahaha!

142
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,420
Haha!

143
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,980
Hahaha!

144
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,340
Yeah!

145
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,380
Hahaha!

146
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,080
Anyway...

147
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,840
Anyway.

148
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,260
As I was saying...

149
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,600
As I was saying...

150
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,160
I was like...

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,180
I woke up...

152
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,040
at...

153
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,540
7 in the morning.

154
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,900
I woke up at...

155
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,760
7 in the morning.

156
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:25,060
7... 7 in the morning and I was so fucking... I was so fucking tired and thing is, even though I woke up at 7 in the morning, I didn't leave the... I didn't leave the apartment until like much...

157
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,420
Well, I had tech rehearsals at 8 a.m.

158
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,180
and I straight up was like, I will be late.

159
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:37,040
I woke up, texted, texted the... because even though I woke up at 7 a.m., if I left around...

160
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,720
If I got dressed and left around like instantly, I would have made it for the tech rehearsal.

161
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,720
But I didn't do that.

162
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,220
I... I did not do that.

163
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,820
I woke up, looked at the server with Anime Revolution and literally wrote, I'm going to be late.

164
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,720
Because I know myself.

165
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,380
I know myself and I knew I was not gonna get there in time.

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,520
I was like, I can't.

167
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,980
I was like, literally, I was like...

168
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,540
I can't.

169
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,200
I was so fucking out of it.

170
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,860
So, I got back to my old apartment at like 8 in the morning.

171
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,480
8 in the morning.

172
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,240
No, 8.30.

173
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,940
I got back at my old apartment at like...

174
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,980
8... 8... 8.30...

175
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,020
8.30...

176
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,180
It's 3 a.m.

177
00:09:38,920 --> 00:10:03,440
and basically what happened was that I did my tech rehearsal and then went to get breakfast and I got back just in time for the panel and after the panel, I went straight to... after the panel, I fucking went straight to... I went straight into the...

178
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,400
straight into the... God, sorry, my brain is like short-circuiting right now.

179
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:25,300
I went straight into the meet-and-greet and after the meet-and-greet, I found out, for those who weren't at my Twitch stream earlier, I literally found out that I was the captain of the Apex Twitch Rivals thing.

180
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:35,280
Because I was getting messages from four different people that I was late for the team draft and everybody was waiting for me.

181
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,780
My meet-and-greet ended.

182
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:45,140
I was late at 1.05 and then I... people were spamming me messages at like 1 because I was late and they're like, where's Toki?

183
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,040
And I was like, I didn't know I was captain.

184
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:57,440
I know I talked about it in the Twitch Rivals stream, but like... but like, I didn't know.

185
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,320
I signed up for it, like, so late.

186
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,020
I signed up for the Twitch Rivals so late.

187
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,580
And then Temple... because Temple was messaging me and being like, you're late for it.

188
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,420
You're... you're late for your draft thing.

189
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,680
And I was like, what?

190
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,260
And like, don't you have the draft channel access?

191
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,780
And I was like, I don't look at the server.

192
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,820
I only look at the server when like, I'm about to stream.

193
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,640
Like, I was like... I was like, what do you mean?

194
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,980
No one messaged me that I was captain.

195
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,620
I only found out because... apparently, because I had the perms.

196
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:46,880
To see the channel that I was captain, that should have... I should have automatically, no, but I'm like, I don't look at that.

197
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,940
I don't... I don't look at the fucking channels.

198
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,660
I just show up when it's time to show up.

199
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,360
I...

200
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:04,240
So, yeah, so I had zero rest and that's why... that's why I needed that 30 minute break.

201
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,780
I needed that 30... I needed... how do I keep getting invites?

202
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,600
And I was like, I'm going to invite it back because they love me.

203
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,120
I'm a riot.

204
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,360
I show up when it's time for me to show up.

205
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,220
I am so fucking hilarious.

206
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,620
That's why they always invite me.

207
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,720
But anyway, that is why I am very exhausted right now.

208
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,660
Because I honestly...

209
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:50,720
I honestly thought I had coffee today, not that I had coffee today, but I honestly thought that I had coffee in my fridge, because I usually always have coffee in my fridge, but I forgot that I'm moving.

210
00:12:51,100 --> 00:13:01,840
By the way, tomorrow I have the animathon panel, the animathon panel in Minigree, and then straight to moving.

211
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,820
Oh yeah, and then straight to Gumi's birthday, and then moving.

212
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:12,860
Because Gumi was spam messaging me about it, and I felt really bad because I was so busy, I didn't see her messages.

213
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,440
She wanted to personally invite me to her birthday stream.

214
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:31,220
So I'll be in Gumi's birthday stream for a couple of... one or two games for Crab Game.

215
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,920
And then after that, I'll be packing again.

216
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,700
I'm going to be packing.

217
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:42,240
It doesn't mean I'm moving tomorrow, but I have to start packing and everything tomorrow for my final move.

218
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,340
Because I already arranged an appointment, so I need to pack for my final fucking move.

219
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,100
So everything will be at my new apartment, and I don't have to do the goddamn commute anymore.

220
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,620
I can be free and never go outside again.

221
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,920
That is my goal.

222
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,680
I need to have my new apartment furnished, and then never touch the outside ever again.

223
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,000
Except to walk dad.

224
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,920
That's...

225
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,480
That's...

226
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,740
That's all I need.

227
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,620
I just... I see the outside.

228
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,340
By the way, my PC room...

229
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,980
This, the current PC room at the moment, I can see the outside.

230
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,040
I purposely chose my new PC room where there is no windows.

231
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,460
Because I do not need any more windows.

232
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,860
It sounds so funny.

233
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,700
The room that's going to be my PC room will have zero windows.

234
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,660
I don't need natural light.

235
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,800
I don't...

236
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,680
I will see the outside when I have to walk dad.

237
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,960
There's a windows...

238
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,720
There's windows outside the PC room.

239
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,940
But the PC room has zero windows.

240
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,200
What if you need fresh air?

241
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,680
That's what Amazon Prime is for.

242
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,660
I can order the fresh air from the fucking mountain Alps.

243
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,080
You're making a depression chamber.

244
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,940
That is the sacrifice I'm willing to make.

245
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,140
I am tired of living in the fucking greenhouse chat.

246
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,600
Like, I don't know if you know this.

247
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,600
But like, I... I... I hate my room that is like...

248
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,300
Okay, I just realized.

249
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,580
This is pissing me off a little bit.

250
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,820
But give me a sec.

251
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,940
I need to like...

252
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,100
This is actually brilliant.

253
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm going to disappear for a second guys.

254
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,920
I realized there's something going on.

255
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,720
That's like really annoying me at the moment.

256
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,880
I was off-centered and I need to be...

257
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,560
I can't.

258
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,240
I'm not... I don't have ADHD.

259
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,920
I just... I just can't be...

260
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,800
I can't.

261
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,800
I was like, I'm off-centered.

262
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,260
I...

263
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,700
I have to be centered again.

264
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,660
I can't.

265
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,080
I can't deal with that.

266
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Okay, sorry.

267
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,960
I don't have OCD either.

268
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,900
I don't have...

269
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,720
I'm just really tired.

270
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,640
I mean, we invented curtains for a reason.

271
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,740
Also, hope this helps the moving funds.

272
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,940
Thank you for the akasupa, Lord Krosus.

273
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,920
Thank you, thank you.

274
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,120
I really, really do appreciate it.

275
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,840
Thank you so much.

276
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,560
And now that I've acknowledged that.

277
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,260
I was off-centered.

278
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,700
You're going to look back the VOD.

279
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,480
And it's going to piss you off when you see the VOD.

280
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,640
And you see I'm off-centered.

281
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,040
No, I'm not.

282
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,680
Now I'm not off-centered.

283
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,380
Look, I'm perfectly centered now.

284
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,520
Chat, look.

285
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm perfectly centered.

286
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,140
Anyway.

287
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,220
There are light bulbs that replicates light of the sun for mental health reasons.

288
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,200
It's all right.

289
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,100
There's no way my mental health...

290
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,840
I'm okay, guys.

291
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,220
I just want you guys to know I'm...

292
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,140
That was a joke, guys.

293
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,740
That was...

294
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,520
That was a joke, guys.

295
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,460
I think she has...

296
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,360
That was just a very...

297
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,220
A very dark joke.

298
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,640
I'm just very...

299
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,140
I'm just tired.

300
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,020
Don't do this to us.

301
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,320
I'm just...

302
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,700
Okay.

303
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:30,400
The reason why I purposely picked a room with no windows is that I'm very tired of living in a fucking green...

304
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,380
I'm very tired of having a greenhouse as my PC workroom.

305
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,900
Because, like, it's...

306
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,020
Oh, my God.

307
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,340
It's always so fucking hot.

308
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,260
It's so hot.

309
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,880
It's pissing me off.

310
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,120
Because, like, the sun shines into the windows and then, like...

311
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,080
And it, like, heats everything up.

312
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,500
And, like, no amount of air conditioning can fix this.

313
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,200
It just can't fix it.

314
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,320
Because I'm literally...

315
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,860
I have fucking two, four, five windows.

316
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,320
I have five fucking giant ass...

317
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,180
Those, like, windows that almost touch the floor.

318
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,000
And I'm in the sun.

319
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,680
It's just...

320
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:06,880
Oh, my God.

321
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,440
Look at me.

322
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,680
I'm just, like, fucking shining onto my body and giving me their UV radioactive rays.

323
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,120
And...

324
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,700
No!

325
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,720
It doesn't work!

326
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,060
The curtains barely fucking hide it!

327
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,860
It's still hot!

328
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,740
It still comes through!

329
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,320
It doesn't fucking do anything!

330
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,340
It...

331
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,320
It doesn't work.

332
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,640
The curtains aren't strong enough to block the sun!

333
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
We gotta destroy the sun.

334
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,640
Like...

335
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,220
Okay.

336
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,520
Let's see.

337
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:36,860
Come on.

338
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:45,900
Anyway, so like, I've given up and I'm just, um, okay, you need, that's what my bedroom's for, right?

339
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,140
That's what, if I, okay, guys, you're like, that's what the, then it's counterintuitive!

340
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,880
If I block the sun with curtains!

341
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,040
Guys, guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but like, um, that's very counterintuitive.

342
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,420
If you want me to get, like, curtains that block the sun, what if I just not have windows?

343
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:25,760
I would, I would never, if I actually get those curtains, I would never, like, I would never, like, unfurl, like, I would never make, like, what's it called, pull the curtains back, like, I would never open the curtains if I actually got those.

344
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,340
So I could have the option.

345
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,180
Guys, you know damn well I will not pick the option.

346
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,380
I will not.

347
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,000
I, you know, damn well I will not use the option.

348
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,560
Yeah, but thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

349
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,620
As a Texan with windows, I hear your pain.

350
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,280
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

351
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,020
Guys, guys, the earth is slowly...

352
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,820
We're, we're slowly being heated up right now.

353
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,280
You know, people are willing to pay for more for that kind of sunlight, right?

354
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,860
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

355
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,040
Yeah, and a lot of those people are from Scandinavia.

356
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,360
Uh...

357
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,760
The thing is, the thing is...

358
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,660
I live, I live in Canada and like, I live in the west coast of Canada.

359
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,480
Because you're in the west coast of Canada, there's too much sun sometimes.

360
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,440
There's way too much sun.

361
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,580
Um...

362
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,660
Anyway, how is this gonna work?

363
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,600
So...

364
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,160
I have no furniture.

365
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,840
And I need help for you guys.

366
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,300
To help me figure out what to buy.

367
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,680
I also want people to help me.

368
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,640
Uh...

369
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,880
I need some people to help.

370
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,840
I need you guys to help me figure out, like...

371
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,880
Uh...

372
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,160
Stuff for my shrine!

373
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,620
Uh, so...

374
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,360
I'm trying to construct my shrine at the moment.

375
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,640
And also, like, trying to figure out, like, what...

376
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,940
I'm not gonna buy from Ikea.

377
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,140
Guys, Ikea is very convenient.

378
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,820
But their furniture is fucking...

379
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,380
Okay, their furniture is... You do... Okay.

380
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,160
I never buy desks for...

381
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,280
From Ikea.

382
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,300
Because... Oh, the Doki Shrine!

383
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,180
Oh my god, let me show you guys the Doki Shrine.

384
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,160
I'm so excited to show you guys this.

385
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
Alright, let me show you guys the Doki Shrine.

386
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,360
So, I'm making a shrine right now.

387
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,440
Of all the stuff that everybody has given me.

388
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,560
Um...

389
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,120
And I wanna have, like, little stands and stuff.

390
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,920
Uh, no, I didn't update it.

391
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,600
So, I wanna have, like, little stands and stuff.

392
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,060
So I can put more stuff...

393
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,920
Um...

394
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
In places.

395
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,840
So I can use...

396
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,780
Use the...

397
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,060
So, like, people have given me some of these.

398
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,360
Some of these are, like, things I bought and stuff.

399
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,620
So, I really wanna have...

400
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,780
Uh...

401
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,520
Um...

402
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,300
I really wanna have, like...

403
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,120
Like, ideas on how...

404
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,700
On, like...

405
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,420
Equipment on...

406
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:53,920
Uh...

407
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,780
What to...

408
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,840
What to buy...

409
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,000
To make a really good Doki Shrine.

410
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,800
And, like, display.

411
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,660
I... Okay!

412
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,920
I don't know if you guys know...

413
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,400
Like...

414
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,960
Like, I don't know if you guys know...

415
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,260
Like...

416
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,360
Any products.

417
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,660
Cause I want, like, these little things.

418
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,180
So I was, like, thinking about getting a little...

419
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,460
I don't know if glass or plastic would be better.

420
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,320
But, like, I wanna have, like...

421
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,700
Um...

422
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,620
Like, not a frame.

423
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,800
Not like a...

424
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,860
Like an art...

425
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,500
Like a...

426
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,100
Art frame.

427
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,160
But, like...

428
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,140
Cause I was thinking I should get a cork board.

429
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,280
Or, like...

430
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,380
Um...

431
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,920
A thing where I can, like...

432
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,580
Press a lot of, like, letters and stuff.

433
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,100
Fan mail and everything.

434
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,440
And then, like...

435
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,180
Press it onto, like, the board.

436
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,620
And then have, like, a plastic thing on top of it.

437
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,120
Or, like, acrylic.

438
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,880
Or glass on top of it.

439
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,080
And then, like...

440
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,660
Hang it.

441
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,640
With all the...

442
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,980
With all the, like, fan letters and everything.

443
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,300
Um...

444
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,740
And...

445
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,720
I need, like...

446
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
I wanna figure out, like...

447
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,280
What...

448
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,480
Like, what that is.

449
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,120
Cause I don't wanna...

450
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,820
I don't wanna use cork...

451
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,440
The reason why I don't wanna use cork board...

452
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,920
Is because I don't wanna...

453
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,660
I don't wanna...

454
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,640
I don't wanna get, like...

455
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,320
I don't wanna damage the letters.

456
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,060
I don't wanna damage the paper.

457
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,080
Or anything.

458
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,400
That's the thing.

459
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,360
I don't wanna damage it with, like...

460
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,520
Pins and...

461
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:02,940
Um...

462
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,300
Uh...

463
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,780
And stuff.

464
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,320
I wanna know if there's, like...

465
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,580
A thing where, like...

466
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,260
Um...

467
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,500
Um...

468
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,720
A thing where I could just, like...

469
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,360
Press these fan letters up against it.

470
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,980
And I don't wanna laminate them.

471
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,940
Because I don't wanna...

472
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,340
No, I wanna...

473
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,120
I wanna hang it.

474
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,800
I don't wanna, like...

475
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,380
I wanna hang it, too.

476
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,440
I don't wanna be able to...

477
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,180
I don't wanna, like...

478
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,700
Damage the paper and everything.

479
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,340
So, like...

480
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,980
I'm trying to, like...

481
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,360
I wanna know if there's, like...

482
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,840
If there's, like...

483
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,280
Products that you can do that.

484
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,160
Cause it feels like...

485
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,220
Something that should exist.

486
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,220
But I want it to be, like...

487
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,700
Hanged.

488
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,560
Cause I wanna see it.

489
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,240
I don't wanna be in the scrapbook or anything.

490
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,820
Cause, like...

491
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,260
I wanna be able to see it.

492
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,560
Like...

493
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,180
On the wall.

494
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,780
Or something.

495
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,340
Um...

496
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,160
But...

497
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,440
Ashram, thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

498
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:43,700
Thank you.

499
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,260
Thank you.

500
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,260
So, I really would love some ideas.

501
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:46,940
On, like...

502
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,880
Like, stuff that can help improve my shrine.

503
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,700
I, like...

504
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,020
I, like...

505
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,060
Saved some links and stuff.

506
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,780
Wait, let me see if I can...

507
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,800
Pull it up.

508
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,120
I, like...

509
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,900
Saved some...

510
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,180
Links.

511
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,900
I have, like...

512
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,140
A tab that wrote...

513
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,680
Furniture.

514
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,960
Like, I saw stuff like this.

515
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,400
And I thought it was super cute.

516
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:03,720
Okay.

517
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,040
I don't know if you can see the picture right now.

518
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,240
Um...

519
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,340
Basically, I saw stuff like this.

520
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,980
Which I thought was super cute.

521
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,660
For, like...

522
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,060
This thing.

523
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,460
Like, small...

524
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,440
Like, plushies.

525
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,940
Or stuff.

526
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,480
No, I don't wanna laminate it.

527
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,140
Cause I don't wanna, like...

528
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,160
Damage it.

529
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,920
Not damage it.

530
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,280
But I don't wanna make it permanent.

531
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,000
You know?

532
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,240
Like, I don't wanna have it, like...

533
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,600
A permanent thing.

534
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,680
But, like...

535
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,500
I also don't wanna...

536
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,340
Do magnets.

537
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,300
Because, like...

538
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,220
I don't wanna, like...

539
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
I'd rather it, like...

540
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,240
Be pressed up.

541
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,040
So that...

542
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,500
It doesn't need to be, like...

543
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,000
It doesn't need to be, like...

544
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,560
What's the word?

545
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,400
Um...

546
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,040
I don't need to have, like...

547
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,920
Multiple magnets.

548
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,200
Just on the board.

549
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,760
Oh, and then I saw these, too.

550
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,360
These were really cute, as well.

551
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,720
I saw these, like...

552
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,440
Um...

553
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,540
These being used as, like...

554
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Displays and stuff.

555
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,080
Which...

556
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,060
Um...

557
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,800
Wait, let me...

558
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,160
Let me save this picture.

559
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,020
I thought these were really cute.

560
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,620
To be used to display, like...

561
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,600
Acrylic stands.

562
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,680
Or charms.

563
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,600
I was thinking about, like...

564
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,340
Hanging them.

565
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,860
Or something.

566
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,240
Hanging the acrylic charms.

567
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:02,960
Or something.

568
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,180
Um...

569
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,340
I don't know.

570
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,260
Save the image.

571
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,860
Is it a web?

572
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,580
Oh, my God.

573
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,580
It's a fucking web.

574
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,580
God damn it.

575
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,820
I hate it when it's...

576
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,380
I hate it when it's a web and...

577
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,400
And be, like...

578
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,540
Who the fuck uses that?

579
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,590
Like...

580
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,450
Stuff like...

581
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,490
Like this.

582
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,990
I thought this was really cute.

583
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,670
I thought this was also...

584
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,130
Really cute, too.

585
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,630
Um...

586
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,230
I'm, like...

587
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,150
Thinking if I should get, like...

588
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,770
Actual...

589
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,910
I don't want to get couches.

590
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,430
Because, like...

591
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,550
A couch is such a...

592
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,410
The thing is...

593
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,570
I'm not going to have a TV.

594
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:35,810
So...

595
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,990
Um...

596
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,170
I'm not going to have a TV.

597
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,550
So, like...

598
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:39,990
I...

599
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,550
Honestly, like...

600
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,470
Oh, what is a shadow box?

601
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,810
I don't know what a shadow box is.

602
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,550
Shadow box.

603
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,090
What is a shadow box?

604
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,410
No.

605
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,350
Because then it's a box.

606
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,210
I want it to be, like...

607
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:55,570
Flat.

608
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,370
You know?

609
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,430
Like, I want it to be, like...

610
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,010
Flat.

611
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,050
Like a cork board.

612
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,230
But, like...

613
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,890
I don't want to damage it.

614
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,830
I'm not going to have a TV.

615
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,310
Who...

616
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:03,610
Okay.

617
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,630
Who said no TV?

618
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,610
Who the...

619
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:05,790
Who said no TV?

620
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,510
Who the fuck uses...

621
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,690
How are you going to watch sports?

622
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,990
I don't want to have a couch.

623
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:12,870
Because I'm just, like...

624
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,730
When am I going to...

625
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:13,970
Why...

626
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,250
When will I ever sit in the living room?

627
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,110
Like...

628
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,310
When...

629
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,370
When the fuck would I ever sit in the living room?

630
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:21,910
Like...

631
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,370
It's just...

632
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,090
It's so stupid.

633
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,470
I don't...

634
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,790
I don't even...

635
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,230
I don't even have...

636
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:33,750
Okay.

637
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,250
Anyway.

638
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:34,890
So...

639
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,790
So...

640
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,070
Oh.

641
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,330
What was I going to say?

642
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,210
What was I going to say?

643
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:38,430
Anyway.

644
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,710
I'm going to make a hashtag right now.

645
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,110
And we're going to fucking decide this.

646
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,390
I'm going to make a hashtag.

647
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:42,990
Okay.

648
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:43,870
Uh...

649
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,030
The hashtag...

650
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,950
And you guys are going to help me.

651
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,070
Hashtag...

652
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,290
Uh...

653
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,650
Hashtag...

654
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,670
Do you never plan to have...

655
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,090
Yes.

656
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,470
God.

657
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,470
Oh, I want people in my apartment.

658
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,130
Next scene.

659
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,810
Thank you for the super chat.

660
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,550
Thank you.

661
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,470
Thank you.

662
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,850
Thank you.

663
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:05,790
Thank you.

664
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,270
Wait.

665
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:06,730
Wait.

666
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,190
That's depressing!

667
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,010
Why do they...

668
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,430
Why do they have apartment?

669
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,110
Why?

670
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,230
Like...

671
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,810
I don't know.

672
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,750
Just...

673
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,550
I don't...

674
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,310
Where are we going to sit on the couches for?

675
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,790
Just hang out at my PC room, I guess?

676
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,670
I...

677
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,530
No?

678
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,990
I don't know.

679
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,130
I don't know.

680
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,350
I don't know.

681
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:35,790
No!

682
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,730
I've never had guests.

683
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,350
Even here, I've never had guests at my old apartment.

684
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,990
So like...

685
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,810
So like, what if family visits?

686
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,310
I'm going to get fucking bean bags.

687
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,230
I don't fucking know.

688
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,750
That's why I don't know what to get!

689
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,950
I don't want to get couches.

690
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,670
It's too much.

691
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,510
Couches are so expensive.

692
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,070
And also like...

693
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,530
Moving out with a couch is such a pain.

694
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,710
JL, thank you for the magenta soup.

695
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,250
Thank you.

696
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:03,790
Thank you.

697
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,810
No guests getting raised up.

698
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,950
Thank you for the magenta soup.

699
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,550
Thank you.

700
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:07,950
Thank you.

701
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,730
Usually like, if I'm hanging out with people...

702
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,650
We don't go over to my place.

703
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,070
We just hang out...

704
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,190
Outside.

705
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,510
Like, I don't know.

706
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,410
It's just... why...

707
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,610
I usually just hang out outside.

708
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,950
Not like...

709
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,490
I've never... I have not visited...

710
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:27,950
Oh wait, no.

711
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,590
That's a lie.

712
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,450
That's a lie.

713
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,330
That's a lie.

714
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,570
Like...

715
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:36,730
Like...

716
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,030
You should just hang out outside or like...

717
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,790
With... at somebody else's place.

718
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,850
That have furniture.

719
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,010
That have couches, I guess.

720
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,290
Alright.

721
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,470
Um...

722
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,210
Furnish...

723
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,350
Furniture.

724
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,350
Okay, furniture.

725
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,530
Did I spell furniture right?

726
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,150
I don't know.

727
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:53,750
I'm too tired.

728
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,770
I don't know.

729
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:59,170
I don't know if I spelled furniture correct.

730
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,910
Oh thank god.

731
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,250
Okay.

732
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,850
I'm like so tired that I...

733
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,790
I don't know if I spelled furniture correctly.

734
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,210
Cass, thank you for the super chat.

735
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:07,570
Thank you.

736
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,090
Thank you.

737
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,490
I haven't had guests for two years.

738
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,050
Yeah, I just visit other people that have couches.

739
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:14,630
Exactly.

740
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,670
I don't even have a couch at my...

741
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,630
At my old place right now.

742
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,370
Like, I literally...

743
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,770
I don't even have like...

744
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,370
Um...

745
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,650
I don't even have like...

746
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,150
Uh... furniture.

747
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,510
I mean I have furniture, but I don't have a couch.

748
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:31,850
That's the thing.

749
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,170
I don't even have a couch.

750
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,450
So...

751
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,110
So I don't need another...

752
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,290
I don't need a couch.

753
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,950
I don't think I ever needed a couch.

754
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,230
Like at best, having a couch is just a...

755
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,590
It's just like a...

756
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,650
A like extra bed for dad.

757
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,630
A like extra bed for dad.

758
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,690
To sleep in.

759
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,650
So it's never been like...

760
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,630
Um...

761
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,690
It's never been like a thing.

762
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,450
It's never been like a thing.

763
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,270
Except for like maybe like four years ago.

764
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,110
Except for like maybe like four years ago.

765
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,050
I had a couch.

766
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,670
But like it was just not worth it.

767
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,430
It's just not...

768
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,410
It's just not worth it.

769
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,230
Alright.

770
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,510
Alright, let's see.

771
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,690
Um...

772
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:16,970
Alright.

773
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,510
Let me...

774
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,390
Let me pull it up.

775
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,990
Alright, so this is gonna be the...

776
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,710
I hope to god nobody has...

777
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,270
Let me check if anybody has used this.

778
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,190
Alright.

779
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,630
It'll be funny.

780
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,510
Okay, there we go.

781
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,510
What the fuck is this?

782
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,110
Bro, what the fuck?

783
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,030

785
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,470
How is it $6,799?

786
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,010
How is it $6,799?

787
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,250
Oh, but it's free delivery.

788
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,030

00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,230

793
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,170
Basically, this is the first suggestion I see.

794
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,350

795
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,210
Guys, but it's free delivery though.

796
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:05,970

797
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,890
It better be for that price.

798
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,430
Like, what the fuck?

799
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,930
Guys, you're supposed to be helping me?

800
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,530

801
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,010

00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,930
Oh, thank god.

00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,330
Guys, I'm not gonna need a table.

804
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,310

805
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,230

00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:35,810
Please.

809
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,870
Someone suggested corkboards.

810
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,930
But the thing is, I don't wanna use corkboards.

811
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,930
Cause I don't wanna damage my...

812
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,070
I don't wanna damage my letters.

813
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,150
That's the thing.

814
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,310

815
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,850

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,970
Um, so I don't wanna use...

817
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,270
A corkboard.

818
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,750
I wanna...

819
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,830
Um, I wanna have something that will keep the letters...

820
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,930

821
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,110
Uh...

822
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,730
Keep the fanmail intact.

823
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:06,930
Um...

824
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,930
Alright, what else?

825
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,790
What else?

826
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,070
Cause I wanna be able to see it.

827
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,230
Oh, for the shrine?

828
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,470
Is this like a storage cabinet?

829
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,130
Oh god, that's huge.

830
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,490
Oh my god.

831
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,150
How much is this?

832
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,070

833
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,210

00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:23,770

If you're gonna send me an Amazon link, can you guys like...

837
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,370
Make sure it's in Canada?

838
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,790
Oh, it's currently unavailable.

839
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,070
Okay, apparently not.

840
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:36,590
I can't.

841
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,990
Guys, also like...

842
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,430
Make sure it's available in...

843
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,050
In Canada.

844
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,710
Make sure...

845
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,910
Make sure it's available in Canada, guys.

846
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,010
Ooh!

847
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,190
Pokemon Kitchenware!

848
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,230
Oh, that's cute!

849
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,490
By the way, this stream is gonna be like an hour and a half.

850
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,450
Like, I'm putting my...

851
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,630
I'm putting my limit at an hour and a half.

852
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,930
Because I don't know how...

853
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,570
I don't know...

854
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,010
What I'm gonna be like in an hour and a half.

855
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,430
I don't...

856
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:14,950
I...

857
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,850
I don't know what's gonna happen to me in an hour and a half, guys.

858
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,390
Wait, what the fuck?

859
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,390
Do you guys put your butter in like...

860
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,910
What the fuck is this?

861
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,410
Ceramic?

862
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,210
What is that?

863
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,590
What the fuck is that?

864
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,610
Okay, wait.

865
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,950
What is this?

866
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,610
Why do you put your butter in ceramic?

867
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,550
I don't understand.

868
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,490
Is this like...

869
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,890
This is not an Asian thing.

870
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,250
This is...

871
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,490
Um...

872
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,970
This is...

873
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,750
Why do you need to put your butter?

874
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,930
Why do you need to put your butter in a ceramic dish?

875
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,930
Why do you need to put your butter in a ceramic dish?

876
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,370
I just make sure when...

877
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,670
When I have butter, all I...

878
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,270
It's convenient.

879
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,090
Yeah, but like...

880
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,990
This is what I do.

881
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,810
I get a Ziploc bag.

882
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,110
I get a Ziploc bag.

883
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,210
And...

884
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,630
I...

885
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,130
I get a Ziploc bag.

886
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,210
I get a Ziploc bag.

887
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,370
And I put it in the butter.

888
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,290
And then I put it in the Ziploc bag.

889
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,470
And then I put it in the fridge.

890
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:18,390
Alright.

891
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,570
What the...

892
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,810
Wait, is that weird?

893
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,450
That's how my parents did it.

894
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,530
Monkey see, monkey do.

895
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,550
What?

896
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,870
What's weird about it?

897
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,810
I get a Ziploc.

898
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,510
And then...

899
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,750
How am I barbarian?

900
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:34,470
Like...

901
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,570
What?

902
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,290
Wait.

903
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,430
Wait.

904
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,550
Wait.

905
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,130
You need Tupperware?

906
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,990
But that's how my parents did it.

907
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,230
But that's how my parents did it.

908
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,630
And then like, I un-Ziploc bag it.

909
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:51,870
And then like, I un-Ziploc bag it.

910
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,350
Can't spread cold butter?

911
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,090
You got weak fucking hands then.

912
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:55,630
Can't spread cold butter?

913
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:55,630
You got weak fucking hands then.

914
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,010
What do you mean?

915
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,750
Yes you can!

916
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,990
Yes you fucking can spread cold butter!

917
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,070
You get the butter out.

918
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,850
My parents are Asian.

919
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,510
Am I?

920
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,570
Are my parents so weird?

921
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,450
I'm gonna check my fridge right now.

922
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,990
I know I don't have a butter tray.

923
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,790
That's for sure.

924
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,870
Alright.

925
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,680
Guys, it's even worse.

926
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,100
Guys, it's even worse.

927
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,300
I didn't realize we've regressed.

928
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,220
My family and I have regressed.

929
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,500
Okay, this is what we do now.

930
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,520
This is what we do now.

931
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,720
So, you know how the butter isn't just like tin foil?

932
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,880
Or like the wrapping?

933
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,660
What we do...

934
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,180
I forgot this is what we used to do.

935
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,920
What we do now.

936
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,480
Because we've regressed a little.

937
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,020
Is that when we unwrap it.

938
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,700
And then we cut the butter.

939
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,100
And then we wrap it back.

940
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,700
And then we put it back in the fridge.

941
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,660
So...

942
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,680
It's no longer in the ziplock bag.

943
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,880
It's no longer in the ziplock bag.

944
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,060
Okay, so that's normal.

945
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,420
That's normal!

946
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,400
Hey!

947
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,940
That's not bad.

948
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,740
Okay, I thought I was weird.

949
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,500
Okay, thank god.

950
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,580
That gives me hope that I'm not weird.

951
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,800
I'm not weird.

952
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,700
Okay, guys?

953
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,020
I used to.

954
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,080
How is that fine?

955
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,220
But a ziplock bag is not.

956
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,780
I don't understand.

957
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,780
How is that okay?

958
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,440
But like I can't put my fucking butter in a ziplock.

959
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,560
How is that weird?

960
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,600
It keeps it fresh!

961
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,760
Doesn't it?

962
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,300
Okay.

963
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,600
Am I seeing...

964
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,480
It keeps it fresh!

965
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,660
If you put stuff in a ziplock bag, it always keeps things fresh.

966
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,620
Isn't that why we have ziplock bags?

967
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,500
Yeah, but it's not like...

968
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,500
We do that too.

969
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,580
Like...

970
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,360
If it's in the fridge, it should be okay, right?

971
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,460
It's like why is...

972
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,440
We can put vegetables and like crackers in ziplock bags.

973
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,260
Why can't I put fucking butter?

974
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,120
Now you're definitely weird.

975
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,920
Affectionate.

976
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,820
I'm doing my best.

977
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,780
I'm doing my best right now.

978
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,600
Alright, let's look at...

979
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,320
Let's look at more jokey furnitures.

980
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,800
Okay.

981
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:50,820
Guys.

982
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,940
What is this?

983
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,780
Grow.

984
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,580
Guys, I need to buy...

985
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,820
I need to actually buy stuff.

986
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,960
I need it.

987
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,020
Guys, please.

988
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,360
I need to...

989
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,880
Guys, I need to actually purchase stuff.

990
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,720
Americans sending you American only items thinking the world revolves around them.

991
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,700
Shake my head.

992
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,920
For legal reasons, this is a joke.

993
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,760
Please donate.

994
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,640
Get out of the US.

995
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,880
Thank you for the super chat.

996
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,280
Thank you.

997
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,560
Thank you.

998
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,160
Thank you, Darkblade.

999
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Okay, you know what's fucked up?

1000
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Okay, I was talking to some American dragoons during the meet and greet in Canada.

1001
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,160
And then I was like, how does it feel...

1002
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,260
How does it feel to be a millionaire in Canada with your American money?

1003
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,620
And they were like, it feels great.

1004
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,840
If I buy something for $1.50 it's basically free for us.

1005
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,620
And I was like, that's fucked.

1006
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,580
I was like, that is so fucked up.

1007
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,780
Free of American money.

1008
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,740
They were like, yeah.

1009
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,620
It feels so nice to spend money in Canada.

1010
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,080
Oh my god.

1011
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,500
Anyway.

1012
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,740
Arrivo has been...

1013
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,380
Oh my gosh.

1014
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:17,760
Okay.

1015
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,540
The reason why Okay, I'll tell you guys the reason why.

1016
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,560
So, the anime revolution it was really scuffed for our concert.

1017
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,920
Because like, for a minute, it was so unfortunate.

1018
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,580
But you know how she's traveling, right?

1019
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,540
She's traveling at the moment, so she doesn't have her actual setup.

1020
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:46,440
And because of that, we were trying to figure out the mixer situation.

1021
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,640
We did tech rehearsals and everything, and it was fine.

1022
00:39:49,880 --> 00:40:00,400
But when we were doing the singing, she accidentally, she apparently pressed something on her mixer that caused the weird cutting in and out.

1023
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,280
And we only found out until the concert was over.

1024
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,680
And we were like, trying to figure it out.

1025
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:17,940
We were literally like, we were trying to be like, I wanted her sound to be good for her next, because she had another concert in the UK.

1026
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,520
So I was trying to help her figure it out.

1027
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,080
And stuff.

1028
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,900
Figure it out, and stuff, before her next concert.

1029
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,100
So that's why!

1030
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,260
That's why it was like, super, it was super weird.

1031
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,700
But it was so unlucky!

1032
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,880
It was literally one button.

1033
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,040
It was one fucking button that caused all of that.

1034
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:45,840
And it got, unfortunately, it was pressed during like, during, like, between the tech rehearsal and the concert.

1035
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,340
Oh my god, it was actually...

1036
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,360
But that means, Mint and I are planning a revenge concert now.

1037
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,180
We are, we're planning on doing a revenge concert in the future!

1038
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,380
Um, we're discussing it, but she's super fucking busy at the moment.

1039
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:07,460
So I told her like, okay, like, um, let's plan this like, after after your, uh, your schedule lightens up.

1040
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,000
Because it's like, super packed.

1041
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,740
Including mine.

1042
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,740
My schedule is like, super fucking packed too.

1043
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,760
Like, we're both, we're both, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!

1044
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,640
What the fuck?

1045
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,160
Sorry.

1046
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,860
Sorry, I got...

1047
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:20,980
What the fuck?

1048
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,820
I got...

1049
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,480
Like, this was in my tags.

1050
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,960
What my... What?

1051
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,180
Who wants to sit on this?

1052
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,740
Who wants to sit on this?

1053
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,980
You didn't even link a website to buy it!

1054
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,180
It's literally a picture!

1055
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,300
I don't even... How... I don't even have a name for this.

1056
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,100
Did you just literally Google crab chair?

1057
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,480
Like, okay, this...

1058
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,340
There's... There's not even a fucking link!

1059
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,640
You just Googled... Oh my god.

1060
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,420
You just gave me an image!

1061
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,460
What am I gonna do with an image?!

1062
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,640
What am I...

1063
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,640
Like, what am I gonna do with a fucking picture?!

1064
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,380
Alright.

1065
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,080
Alright.

1066
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,860
Clearly, we're not gonna buy that.

1067
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,220
Oh, wireless phone charger.

1068
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,140
I have one though.

1069
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,700
Yeah, I have one... Like, I have one on my desk by itself.

1070
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,220
So, like, I don't really need that.

1071
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:26,260
Just buy a lot of fucking long mower... I'm not gonna fucking buy... Oh my god!

1072
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,460
I've always wanted to buy this!

1073
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,900
Okay.

1074
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,180
So, like, this is, like, something I, like, thought about for a while now.

1075
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,000
This is, like, um...

1076
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:42,480
Okay, I always thought it was, like, super funny, but apparently it's actually, like, really good for you.

1077
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,940
Like, you can actually, like...

1078
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,460
It's really good for sleep, but...

1079
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,400
Um, I'm talking about these.

1080
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,800
This.

1081
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,000
This is basically a dog bed for humans.

1082
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,520
So, like, it's on...

1083
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,000
It was on Shark Tank, guys.

1084
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,260
You know it's good when it's on Shark Tank.

1085
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,380
So...

1086
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:18,840
I heard that... I actually read it, but I actually saw videos of it, but you can actually, like, sleep for a very long time.

1087
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,200
You sleep for a very... It's, like, incredibly comfortable, and... You know what?

1088
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:24,800
I'm gonna order one.

1089
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,720
I've always... Now that I have my own apartment that I rent...

1090
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,460
Guys, it is $299.

1091
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,860
What the fuck?

1092
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,800
That is...

1093
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,140
That is... Holy... Okay.

1094
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,220
What is that in Canadian money, though?

1095
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,090
Okay.

1096
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,590
Alright.

1097
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,050
Let's play a game called...

1098
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,810
Guess which one's the American dollar version.

1099
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,890
Let's play...

1100
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,610
Let's... Guys, let's play a little game.

1101
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,950
Guess which one is Canadian, and guess which one is American.

1102
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:20,450
Okay.

1103
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,810
That's so fucked.

1104
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,810
That's actually so fucked.

1105
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:25,910
What the fuck?

1106
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,030
How?

1107
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,610
Is this that bad?

1108
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:29,470
Is there...

1109
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,250
Please...

1110
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:36,290
This is why my shop automatically accepts American dollars now.

1111
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:38,470
Alright.

1112
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,210
We're gonna play a little game, everybody.

1113
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,590
I love playing...

1114
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,150
Playing this little game that we're gonna play.

1115
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,010
Alright.

1116
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,070
So...

1117
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:49,890
Alright.

1118
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:51,990
Hey.

1119
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,870
Two hundred and ninety-nine dollars.

1120
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,370
That's not so bad.

1121
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,660
Oh.

1122
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:01,980
.

1123
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,080
.

1124
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,760
.

1125
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:05,940
.

1126
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,180
.

1127
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:06,340
.

1128
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,040
Hey,

1129
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,140
guys, but it's free delivery, though.

1130
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,060
.

1131
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,300
.

1132
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:21,460
.

1133
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:27,640
What?

1134
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,540
.

1135
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,920
Um... It's same...

1136
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,460
It's delivered by the same company.

1137
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,420
.

1138
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,500
I don't understand.

1139
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,020
I... I don't understand.

1140
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:43,520
.

1141
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,000
I... I don't understand.

1142
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,580
Do you not have a...

1143
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:56,280
Do you not have a distributor in... Oh my god, there's a... Oh, thank god.

1144
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,680
Guys.

1145
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,080
Guys.

1146
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,700
There's a rip-off version in Canada.

1147
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,600
Guys.

1148
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,460
Guys.

1149
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,500
Oh, thank god.

1150
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:17,460
There's an off-brand version in Canada called KJY Zoom.

1151
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,120
That I'm pretty sure is a lot cheaper.

1152
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,800
Congratulations.

1153
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,140
Oh my god.

1154
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:26,640
Guys.

1155
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,540
Oh my god.

1156
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,100
There's a rip-off brand.

1157
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,240
I'm so happy.

1158
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,680
And it's on Twitch Prime.

1159
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,340
Sorry, not Twitch Prime.

1160
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,520
And it's on Amazon Prime.

1161
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,300
Guys.

1162
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,160
Oh my god.

1163
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Oh my god.

1164
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,260
It's cheaper than the American dollar, everyone.

1165
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,860
It's...

1166
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,260
Oh my god.

1167
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:53,020
It's even cheaper than the American version.

1168
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,560
This is the best.

1169
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,380
.

1170
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,360
I can't believe it.

1171
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,620
The Canadian off-brand version.

1172
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,940
It has to be the same thing, right?

1173
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,100
This bootleg has to be...

1174
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,920
What does it look like?

1175
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,360
It's literally the same picture.

1176
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,620
Except they have like...

1177
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,140
Okay.

1178
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:22,120
The funniest shit is that you can tell that this picture is like photoshopped so hard.

1179
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,260
Which is the dog isn't even actually there.

1180
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,800
Which I thought was the funniest.

1181
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,160
Okay.

1182
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,620
So...

1183
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,060
Cause like, the original picture from the actual... the real brand.

1184
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,320
Um... from the real brand is... it's obvious that like, they're actually using it.

1185
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,280
But like, this is the most photoshopped picture I've ever seen.

1186
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:42,960
Oh...

1187
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,740
I don't even think this dog is supposed to be there.

1188
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,760
I know this dog is definitely photoshopped.

1189
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,680
Like, look at this.

1190
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,600
This dog is not there.

1191
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,260
There's no way.

1192
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,440
There's no way this dog is actually there.

1193
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,480
There's not...

1194
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,060
I don't even think this...

1195
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,580
Wait, where's her feet?

1196
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,080
Wait, you're right.

1197
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,600
Where the fuck did her feet go?

1198
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,380
Like, I don't even think this background is real too.

1199
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,360
I don't even think this background is real.

1200
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,020
But this is the photoshopped from the bootleg version.

1201
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,880
Which I am a little bit tempted to get.

1202
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,560
Okay.

1203
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,280
Okay, I'll show you.

1204
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,160
I'll show you.

1205
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,880
I don't even think the baby is actually on... Guys.

1206
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,440
Guys, I'm gonna show you this other picture.

1207
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,300
And guys, I don't think the baby is even real.

1208
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:48,580
I don't think that's a real baby.

1209
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,060
I don't know.

1210
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,140
Guys, I don't think...

1211
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,880
I don't think that's a real baby.

1212
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,860
I don't think the baby was on the bed.

1213
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,240
I don't think the baby was on the bed.

1214
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:08,560
I don't think it's real.

1215
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,360
I don't think it's real.

1216
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,460
This looks very...

1217
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,380
It looks off.

1218
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,860
Where are the shadows?

1219
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,080
Where are...

1220
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,320
Where even...

1221
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,040
Where is the shadow?

1222
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,160
Where is the lighting coming from?

1223
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,000
Like, here, here, here, here.

1224
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,340
Guys, I don't think I should buy the app.

1225
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,220
Guys, I don't know.

1226
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:37,660
The more I look into it, the more I realize, maybe I shouldn't buy the off-brand version chat.

1227
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:38,980
I...

1228
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,760
I think that maybe the off-brand...

1229
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,360
Okay, okay, this one's my...

1230
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,540
Actually, out of all this image, I think this one's my favorite.

1231
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,860
I'm gonna crop it, because I, like, I need you guys to see just how...

1232
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,340
Like, how...

1233
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,460
How off this is.

1234
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,680
Okay.

1235
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,380
Like...

1236
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,920
Like, what the...

1237
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,260
Why?

1238
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,340
Why is there, like, a little line of...

1239
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,570
I don't think the background's real, either.

1240
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,810
This doesn't look right.

1241
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:26,410
Like...

1242
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,550
None of this looks right.

1243
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,490
This doesn't...

1244
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,630
There's something wrong.

1245
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,230
Guys, but it's $200, though.

1246
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,530
Guys, remember, it is $200.

1247
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:45,450
It is $500 cheaper, everybody.

1248
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:48,790
It's...

1249
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:51,510
It's $500 cheaper.

1250
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,470
Guys, I swear.

1251
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:55,990
Alright.

1252
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,890
Guys, I mean...

1253
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,910
I mean...

1254
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,330
It could be...

1255
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,730
Okay, let's look at the reviews.

1256
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:05,550
You're right, you're right.

1257
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:06,290
Let me read the reviews.

1258
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:08,850
Let's see.

1259
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,250
I mean...

1260
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,490
I like how somebody was like, It's okay.

1261
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,610
The sides sag.

1262
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:18,750
There's no support.

1263
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:23,530
It feels like sleeping directly on the floor, because the foam is thin and flimsy.

1264
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,010
I mean, there's some people that had good reviews.

1265
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:26,830
Average.

1266
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:31,510
Average.

1267
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,670
The sides flops down and don't sit up like pictured.

1268
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:36,490
Well designed to make it washable.

1269
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,210
Five star dog bed.

1270
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,390
Three star human.

1271
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:40,730
However, the kids love it.

1272
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:40,970
Hey!

1273
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:42,930
I'm a kid at heart.

1274
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,070
That's almost the same thing.

1275
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:46,350
Right?

1276
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:48,890
Okay, what are the reviews for...

1277
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,830
Okay.

1278
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,590
A lot of people really liked the...

1279
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:53,670
Husband loves it.

1280
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:55,690
A lot of people like the official one.

1281
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:57,250
This is fucked.

1282
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,570
Why is it $632?

1283
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,090
This is so messed up.

1284
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,970
This is so fucking...

1285
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,170
Why is it $600?

1286
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:06,050
Wait!

1287
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,270
If you buy it from the official store?

1288
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,090
It's more expensive?

1289
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,480
The official... because like I was looking at a distributor.

1290
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,220
I was looking at a distributor and the official...

1291
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,260
The official?

1292
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,420
The official store is even more expensive.

1293
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,900
But I get free delivery though.

1294
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,180
On Tuesday, August 13th if I order it within 9 hours.

1295
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,880
Guys, I don't know.

1296
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,240
Do I buy it?

1297
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,600
Guys, do I...

1298
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,520
Guys, I...

1299
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,560
Guys, all I'm saying is that like, you know...

1300
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,940
It's $696 Canadian dollars.

1301
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,140
It's $696 Canadian dollars.

1302
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:08,540
And like...

1303
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,760
I mean...

1304
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,000
It looks really comfy.

1305
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,200
It looks really...

1306
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,500
It looks really...

1307
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,360
Just get the crap...

1308
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:32,000
Okay, you guys were willing for me to buy the fucking Garfield table that was $6,700 but I can't have a dog bed that I can sleep in.

1309
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,100
It's not for dad, it's for me.

1310
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,600
It's not even for dad.

1311
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,700
It's for me.

1312
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,000
Garfield is worth it.

1313
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,060
It's not even for dad.

1314
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,540
It's worth it for me.

1315
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,740
It's worth it for me.

1316
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:02,860
It's worth it for me.

1317
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,060
Okay, then I'm fine.

1318
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,200
Thank you.

1319
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,740
Thank you.

1320
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,440
Okay, guys.

1321
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,760
Just think about it, guys.

1322
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,240
If I order it within...

1323
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,420
I get the expensive dog bed for yourself.

1324
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,120
Why did this person fucking put her dog bed on a bed?

1325
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,480
Just sleep on the fucking bed.

1326
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,140
Like, get a slush plushy bacon.

1327
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,400
Thank you for the super chat.

1328
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:28,880
Thank you.

1329
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,760
Guys, okay, I don't...

1330
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,780
This... I don't understand.

1331
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,420
I don't understand.

1332
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,040
Why would you put your dog bed on top of the fucking bed?

1333
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,800
Just sleep on your fucking bed at this point.

1334
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:42,940
Why?

1335
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,030
Like, I thought that was supposed to go on the floor.

1336
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:53,490
Like...

1337
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,990
Isn't this supposed to go on the floor?

1338
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,050
The other pictures are on the floor.

1339
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:02,410
Why is this girl putting it on the bed?

1340
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:10,370
Like, what the fuck is the point of getting yourself a human dog bed if you don't put it on the floor?

1341
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:13,590
For the photo and lighting.

1342
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,990
Dog bed for Doki.

1343
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,950
Your human bed for dad.

1344
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,270
That's a cool idea.

1345
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,830
Thank you for the super chat, Kaz.

1346
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:23,270
Thank you.

1347
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,630
A bean bag bed?

1348
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:27,550
That exists?

1349
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:28,770
Bean...

1350
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:31,350
Are we not gonna buy anything today?

1351
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:35,730
Are we really, like, not making any progress at all?

1352
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:40,510
Are we not gonna make any progress?

1353
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:44,470
Oh my god, this reminds me of like, what was it called?

1354
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,090
Arm...

1355
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:48,730
Um...

1356
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,290
Comfort pillow.

1357
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:52,650
Do you guys remember that?

1358
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,650
Uh... Oh my god, what was it?

1359
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:00,810
There's like a pillow that simulates...

1360
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:05,170
that simulates, like, a person, like, hugging you.

1361
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,770
And I'm trying to remember what it was called.

1362
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,910
So, like, you won't get lonely.

1363
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,250
Is it called the comfort pillow?

1364
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:15,830
It's been a long time.

1365
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,250
Comfort... Is it the boyfriend pillow?

1366
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:20,910
I remember that.

1367
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,530
That, like, went viral.

1368
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,230
Oh, there it is!

1369
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,510
There it is!

1370
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,130
This is what it looks like, guys.

1371
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:30,610
This is what I'm talking about.

1372
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:32,570
This has...

1373
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,150
Okay.

1374
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,910
Sora, thank you for the super chat.

1375
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:45,250
Thank you.

Thank you.

1377
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,170
You have my first super.

1378
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,530
This will buy you some ketchup.

1379
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,770
This came out of any rebel budget.

1380
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,670
Thank you for the super chat, Sora.

1381
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:54,190

00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:56,970
Okay.

1387
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:57,710
Alright.

1388
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:58,410
Okay.

1389
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,770
When I show you this, the...

1390
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:04,850
The punchline is the... is the description of this.

1391
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:07,330
Okay, so this is called...

1392
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:11,130
This is called the boyfriend cuddle pillow.

1393
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:12,770
But...

1394
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:14,270
The thing is...

1395
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,150
What I love about it...

1396
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:18,510
Is that...

1397
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,010
It's a gag gift.

1398
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:24,290
But...

1399
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:28,430
What I... The funniest part about this gag gift...

1400
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,830
Is...

1401
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,190
The fact that...

1402
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,370
You can get it for your mom.

1403
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,880
If you wanna, you know...

1404
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,040
Send it to your mom.

1405
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,120
You know...

1406
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,780
She would love that.

1407
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,060
Oh my god.

1408
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,560
There was like a legit one though.

1409
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,760
I'm trying to remember...

1410
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,800
Which one it was.

1411
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:00,580
Oh, this one.

1412
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,780

Happy Mother's Day Mom!

1416
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,700
I know you're lonely.

1417
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:12,840
I know you're lonely.

1418
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,640
Thank you for the akasupa.

1419
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,940
Thank you, thank you.

00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,200
I appreciate it.

1423
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:29,740
Hey Dokie, me and Sayaka had a great time organizing the banner for Annie Revel.

1424
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,140
We were happy to meet other dragoons at the event.

1425
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,020
Thank you for the akasupa.

1426
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,280
Thank you, thank you.

00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,620
I am super excited to receive it.

00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,240
I'm glad you had a great time.

1429
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:39,940
Alright,

1430
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,420
let's see.

1431
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,760
Someone recommended me an air conditioner.

1432
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,940
I'm not... what the f**k is this?

1433

Okay, guys.

1436
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,120
Wait, Big Dave?

1437
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,720
Oh wait, that's $975,000.

1438
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,220
I didn't know that.

1439
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,220
I thought that was $975.

1440
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,240
Okay.

1441
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,520

Oh, is that... Okay, I don't like making coffee.

00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,260
What the f**k is that?

1449
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:53,200
Free crush proof plastic balls for a ball pit?

1450
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,220
Guys, I know like mentally I act like a child, but guys.

1451
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:00,340
Guys.

01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,060
Please, I need...

01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,200
Please, I need real friends.

1455
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:08,620
Okay, guys, a chair.

1456
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,300
Oh, what is this?

1457
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,360
Bean bag chair.

1458
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:18,220
Giant high-density foam-filling sofa with foot stools.

1459
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:18,700
Oh!

1460
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,880
It has a... Okay.

1461
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,520
I mean, that looks nice.

1462
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:30,060
Guys, the only good suggestions I had so far was literally the dog bed for adults.

1463
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,740
Okay, guys, please.

1464
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,400
Please...

1465
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:39,940
Okay, I won't get a sofa, but this looks extra comfy.

1466
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,180
Like, where would I sit?

1467
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,360
Like, why would I ever sit in the living room?

1468
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,260
Like, that's the thing.

1469
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,300
I'm just like thinking like, why would I sit at the living room?

1470
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:56,620
So...

1471
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,280
That does look nice.

1472
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,520
That looks dumb.

1473
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:02,920
Hahaha

1474
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,280
Chad is just like, that looks nice.

1475
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,360
That looks like shit.

1476
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,680
And it'd be super uncomfortable?

1477
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,380
Alright, let's see what the reviews are.

1478
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,420
I'll check the reviews.

1479
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,240
It is one day.

1480
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,600
This is not worth it.

1481
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,160
It is misshapen and uncomfortable.

1482
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,180
Very heavy and hard to return.

1483
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:25,760
Okay.

1484
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,600
That... oh... it's coming up, but the material is weird and not soft.

1485
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,940
Not worth $300.

1486
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,840
If it was like a hundred dollars, okay.

1487
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,740
But headache in returning.

1488
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,140
Guys, it's all in the title.

1489
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,040
Poor quality.

1490
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,840
Guys, I don't know if this is the right purchase.

1491
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:44,660
Hahaha!

1492
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:46,940
Wait, never.

1493
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,200
It's misshapen and uncomfortable.

1494
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,320
Very hard.

1495
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:52,940
Oh my god.

1496
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,100
Is there anything that's actually good?

1497
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,800
Like, is there anything that's actually comfortable?

1498
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,900
Oh my god.

1499
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,920
Wait, what is this?

1500
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,440
Wait, what the fuck is this?

1501
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,060
This is $8,700?

1502
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:15,680
It doesn't even have... it doesn't even have... it's not even on Prime!

1503
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,320
Okay, I was suggested this.

1504
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:28,740
If I make $8,700 right now on this stream, I will purchase this.

1505
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,500
Hahaha!

1506
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,180
Hahaha!

1507
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:32,820
Hahaha!

1508
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,040
Hahaha!

1509
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:34,060
Hahaha!

1510
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,680
Hahaha!

1511
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,860
If I... this is creepy.

1512
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,060
Hahaha!

1513
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,680
What do it... what the fuck is even that?

1514
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,040
No, you won't.

1515
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:50,620
Yes, I will.

1516
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,580
Hahaha!

1517
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,480
Thank you for coming to Adiriva.

1518
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:56,180
Love the concert and talk show.

1519
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,860
I'm so glad you enjoyed it!

1520
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,600
Kunari, I'm so happy.

1521
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,700
You had a great time.

1522
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1523
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,360
Thank you, thank you.

1524
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,280
All I'm saying...

1525
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:21,060
If this stream ends up getting $8,700 in Canadian, I will buy this chair at the end of the stream.

1526
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:21,820
Hahaha!

1527
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,900
Don't tempt... I will 100% do it.

1528
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:27,700
Hahaha!

1529
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,320
This is what it looks like.

1530
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:36,080
I mean, it's a terrible idea, but at least it's also kind of neat.

1531
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,720
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it there.

1532
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:39,540
Hahaha!

1533
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,320
That's not... how much is that?

1534
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,640
This is what it is.

1535
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:44,980
Okay.

1536
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,620
Nox, thank you for this Akasupa.

1537
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,040
Thank you, thank you.

1538
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,180
Yes, Doki, buy it.

1539
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,740
Lord Kurosu, thank you for the Akasupa.

1540
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:54,800
Thank you, thank you.

1541
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:55,920
Foolishness, Doki.

1542
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:57,840
Foolishness.

1543
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,600
All right, let's see.

1544
01:03:59,680 --> 01:03:59,840
Okay.

1545
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,380
How much is that in...

1546
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,740
Sorry, $8,706.

1547
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,520
Because of shipping.

1548
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,020
There's a $5 delivery fee.

1549
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:10,940
All right.

1550
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,480
What the hell is even that?

1551
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,640
It's called...

1552
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:27,280
The Scorpion Gaming Chair Floor Gaming Chair Ergonomic Computer Cockpit Chair with 16 Color RGB Light Zero Gravity Leather Boss Seat.

1553
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,760
A high back chair gaming cockpit for office and home.

1554
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,100
A high back chair gaming cockpit for office and home.

1555
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:33,260
A high back chair gaming cockpit for office and home.

1556
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:33,580
Green.

1557
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,440
Don't forget, it is also green.

1558
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,420
It looks dumb to it.

1559
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:46,980
It looks dumb to it.

1560
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,820
Thank you for the super chat.

1561
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,580
Thank you for the...

1562
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,960
Okay, but look at this, guys.

1563
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,740
Guys, it's very...

1564
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,840
Clearly, it's like... Okay, let me...

1565
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,180
CAD to USD.

1566
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,860
That is like...

1567
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,880
That's like $6,000.

1568
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:05,380
So, like, you know...

1569
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,360
It's still pretty bad.

1570
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,520
But, you know...

1571
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,200
It's maybe not that bad.

1572
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,480
All right.

1573
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:12,540
Let me...

1574
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:16,280
Let me talk about why this chair looks very comfortable.

1575
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,380
All right.

1576
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,080
It has...

1577
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:26,920
It has an ergonomic health design, which I would say might be better than the Herman Miller.

1578
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:31,700
It's scientifically designed to imitate human mechanics.

1579
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:37,940
The cockpit structure fits the body curve and can support all parts of the body.

1580
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:51,380
So, as you can see, this part, this scorpion tail would support the neck, the arm, and then the body would be the waist and the buttocks and then the thigh and the calf.

1581
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,780
And then, like...

1582
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,100
She's clearly gaming out of her fucking mind.

1583
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:15,200
All I'm saying is that if we somehow raise enough money by the end of the stream, I will purchase this chair.

1584
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,080
I don't think that even looks...

1585
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,860
Are you trying to say that...

1586
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:28,100
That Golden Helm V-MetalBR lied to me?

1587
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,460
His profile is literally metal.

1588
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,340
Are you telling me...

1589
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,960
Are you telling me this guy...

1590
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:43,620
This guy right here who made this beautiful suggestion to us lied to us?

1591
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:47,840
That it is not healthy for me.

1592
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,380
Um...

1593
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,860
Thank you for the thank you, thank you.

1594
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,100
Challenge accepted.

1595
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,560
You get up!

1596
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,320
What do you mean how do you get out of it?

1597
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,600
You fucking get up!

1598
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:06,640
Golden Helm V-MetalBR Are you in my chat?

1599
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:07,680
Are you joking?

1600
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:08,980
Or are you serious?

1601
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,900
He definitely did lie.

1602
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:12,860
I...

1603
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:13,280
See?

1604
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,300
I bought... This is my Kickstarter.

1605
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,980
I am making a GoFundMe right now.

1606
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,460
Hahaha You don't get up.

1607
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,580
You just never leave.

1608
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,400
Why would you leave?

1609
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,860
It's... It's agronomic.

1610
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:29,740
Guys...

1611
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:34,340
It's literally... It's literally good for your back.

1612
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,940
It's good for your... Um...

1613
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,640
It's good for your neck.

1614
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:40,260
It's good for your buttocks.

1615
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,480
This lady literally said...

1616
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:43,740
Look...

1617
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,140
Neck, Arm, Waist, Butt, Thigh, Calf.

1618
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:48,820
How?

1619
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,940
What could go wrong?

1620
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,900
What could fucking go wrong?

1621
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,480
I'm doing my part.

1622
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,360
Jonathan, thank you for the super chat.

1623
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:58,900
Thank you.

1624
01:07:58,900 --> 01:07:59,580
Thank you.

1625
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:05,840
I just need you guys to know a Herman Miller is cheaper than this chair.

1626
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,940
I have a Herman Miller right now and I was a fool for buying it.

1627
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,140
I was a fucking fool for buying a Herman Miller.

1628
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:23,820
This chair is so good that this chair is so fucking good that there's zero reviews.

1629
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:36,020
And that means that there's no negative reviews.

1630
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:46,940
All I'm saying is that if there's zero reviews that means there's no negative reviews.

1631
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:51,630
Alright.

1632
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:57,610
Alright.

1633
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:58,750
Guys.

1634
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,690
I found... Guys.

1635
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,490
I found a...

1636
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:07,270
I found a...

1637
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:09,230
You can buy it in America...

1638
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:09,670
Oh wait, wait.

1639
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:10,330
What the fuck?

1640
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:11,750
What's the difference between...

1641
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,810
There's an off-brand version.

1642
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:17,050
How is there an off-brand version of this chair?

1643
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:22,410
Why would anyone buy the off-brand version of this chair?

1644
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:28,950
It already looks dangerous enough with the fucking monitors on your fucking face.

1645
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:31,530
I don't trust the off-brand version.

1646
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:35,550
There's an actual off-brand version of this.

1647
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,650
And there's reviews for the off-brand version.

1648
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:39,730
Why?

1649
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:44,810
Don't buy the off-brand.

1650
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:48,210
You guys, there's an off-brand version.

1651
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:50,950
And the reviews are like...

1652
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:52,690
Okay.

1653
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:56,010
Alright.

1654
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,410
This is...

1655
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:02,450
This is the...

1656
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:03,170
This is the...

1657
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:03,450
This is the reviews.

1658
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,770
I'll show you guys the reviews for this.

1659
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:10,350
Okay.

1660
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:10,730
Alright.

1661
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:11,310
This one.

1662
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:12,650
And then...

1663
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:14,430
This one.

1664
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:16,710
Alright.

1665
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:17,470
Let's see.

1666
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,070
Alright.

1667
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:19,870
Here are the...

1668
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:22,550
Here are the official reviews for this.

1669
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:23,490
Alright.

1670
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:24,670
For this amazing chair.

1671
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:26,110
That we're...

1672
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:27,870
If we crowdfunded, I will buy.

1673
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:34,660
So...

1674
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,000
This guy said...

1675
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,260
It looks like a banana.

1676
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,300
I'm not... I don't like bananas.

1677
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,340
And then...

1678
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,100
This other guy...

1679
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,960
This other guy...

1680
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,380
Was...

1681
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,580
Was like...

1682
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,720
Let me grab it.

1683
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,060
Oh my god.

1684
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:57,940
I need to reset this.

1685
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:59,020
Alright.

1686
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,520
Transform.

1687
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,400
Reset.

1688
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:00,720
Alright.

1689
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:07,870
This is a banana scorpion, guys.

1690
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,170
Ha ha ha ha.

1691
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:12,990
Ha ha ha ha.

1692
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,410
Ha ha ha ha.

1693
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:17,250
Ha ha ha ha.

1694
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:20,390
So like...

1695
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:21,890
The negative reviews...

1696
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:24,210
It's not because it's a bad chair.

1697
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:25,130
Ha ha ha.

1698
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:26,710
It's just because...

1699
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:30,450
They didn't like that the chair reminded them...

1700
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,410
Of bananas.

1701
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:35,210
I...

1702
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,010
It's literally the same chair.

1703
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,930
The off-bat chair is literally the same chair.

1704
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:47,690
It's the same woman sitting on this chair.

1705
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:55,010
They literally grabbed the photo from the official one and then like photoshopped it and gave her a background.

1706
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:56,570
Like what?

1707
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,250
Is this the actual background?

1708
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,870
I don't understand.

1709
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:08,910
I don't... did they... which one's the real one?

1710
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,090
Which one's the real photo?

1711
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,030
I assume this is the real photo.

1712
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:14,090
But like this is from the off-brand photo.

1713
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,310
Okay, I'm so confused, guys.

1714
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,850
Guys, I don't know which one's real and which one's not.

1715
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,070
Okay, alright.

1716
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:20,290
I'll tell you why.

1717
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:21,090
I'm really confused.

1718
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:25,390
Okay, so... so you know how like... alright.

1719
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:28,430
So, we saw this photo.

1720
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:30,650
We saw...

1721
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,310
We saw this photo.

1722
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:36,150
Oh.

1723
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,310
This photo, right?

1724
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:39,890
But then... what the fuck is this?

1725
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,190
This is from the off-brand.

1726
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,350
Which one's the real one?

1727
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,270
They're both the same lady.

1728
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,870
But the logo is scrubbed off.

1729
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:54,910
This one is the official one.

1730
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,630
But this one's the off-brand.

1731
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:00,230
Why does the off-brand have the official photo?

1732
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:04,210
Why is there no logo on the desk mat?

1733
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,470
There's a logo here.

1734
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,210
There's a...

1735
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:10,470
Which one's real?

1736
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,910
I can't tell.

1737
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,730
I... I can't tell.

1738
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:19,370
Does that mean the off-brand was the real la la la?

1739
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:24,630
The real and the off-brand has LED so it's better.

1740
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:30,210
They all have LED so it's better.

1741
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,170
What are you talking about?

1742
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,710
Holy shit, the plot twist.

1743
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,450
I don't know, because it's cheaper.

1744
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:40,150
Which one's the real chair?

1745
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:41,710
Wait.

1746
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,170
But which one's the real one?

1747
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:45,710
Which...

1748
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:47,630
Which one?

1749
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:49,550
Which...

1750
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:52,110
Wait, I can buy it on AliExpress.

1751
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,210
But it's also $6,800.

1752
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,070
Okay, I'm gonna...

1753
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,230
What the fuck?

1754
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:06,370
Guys, it's on AliExpress, but for some reason, it's like the exact same price as Amazon.

1755
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:08,690
So I don't think it's worth it.

1756
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,030
I don't think it's worth it, guys.

1757
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:16,570
Who created this?

1758
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:20,970
A small price to pay for a peek.

1759
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:23,410
Who the fuck?

1760
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,350
Wait, but they also have the lady!

1761
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:27,970
Wait!

1762
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,150
The lady exists!

1763
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:32,710
It exists in the AliExpress photo too!

1764
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:34,730
But like...

1765
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:36,690
It's a different background!

1766
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,250
Which one's the right...

1767
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,910
Which one's the real lady?

1768
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,390
Who's the real lady and who's the fake?

1769
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:47,110
Guys!

1770
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:52,930
She's in a different...

1771
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:55,470
She's in a new house!

1772
01:14:58,950 --> 01:14:59,650
Guys!

1773
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,170
She's in a new house!

1774
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,630
She's in the house now!

1775
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,850
Hey, can I copy your homework?

1776
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:11,470
Sure, but change something so it doesn't look like you copied.

1777
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:13,450
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

1778
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:14,430
Thank you, thank you.

1779
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,050
Tacos, thank you for the super chat.

1780
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:19,930
Thank you, thank you.

1781
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,170
Hey Toki, it was my birthday yesterday.

1782
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:23,390
I wasn't sure what to get myself.

1783
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:26,350
But then I remembered when I got into your body cam stream.

1784
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:28,850
So I got some red dot optics.

1785
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:30,770
Good luck for finishing your new place!

1786
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:31,770
Thank you for the super chat!

1787
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:32,670
Thank you, thank you.

1788
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:33,710
Happy birthday.

1789
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,410
I'll do you a belated birthday song.

1790
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:37,090
Happy birthday to you.

1791
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,730
Happy birthday to you.

1792
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,650
Happy birthday, dear Tacos.

1793
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:41,810
Happy birthday to you.

1794
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:42,250
Yeah!

1795
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:43,590
Guys.

1796
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,870
I think this is the real one.

1797
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,490
But this is the off-brand.

1798
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:49,370
This is the AliExpress.

1799
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,690
And then this one is from the official website.

1800
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,800
Not the official website, but the $8000 one.

1801
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:56,570
What?

1802
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:57,610
What?

1803
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:58,970
What?

1804
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:02,890
What?

1805
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:03,630
What?

1806
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:05,190
This is what cheap online stuff tells me.

1807
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,690
They are both made in the same factory.

1808
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:08,530
But they just changed the brand.

1809
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:10,390
So do I get the off-brand stuff?

1810
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:12,650
Is it made with cheaper materials?

1811
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:14,110
Oh, guys.

1812
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:15,010
It's not cheaper.

1813
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:16,890
The delivery is $901.

1814
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:20,810
They almost got me.

1815
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,050
Yes.

1816
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:25,790
They almost got me.

1817
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:26,490
Yes.

1818
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,990
The $8000 one was only $5 delivery.

1819
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:35,770
I didn't see the $900.

1820
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:36,810
Whoa.

1821
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,650
They almost fooled me.

1822
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:44,030
They almost fooled me.

1823
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:54,190
Why is it so expensive?

1824
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:55,910
Because look at it.

1825
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:59,350
I can't wait to get crushed by my monitor.

1826
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:03,050
It's the dream.

1827
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,530
Like who wouldn't want this?

1828
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:10,730
Want all of this?

1829
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,590
To be fair, I want the green one.

1830
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:13,590
Actually, no.

1831
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:14,730
What colors does it come in?

1832
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:15,950
Okay.

1833
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,490
It comes in black.

1834
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:18,190
Okay.

1835
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:18,990
The black one.

1836
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:20,570
Oh, wait.

1837
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:21,090
Okay.

1838
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:21,370
Wait.

1839
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:23,030
What does the red one look like?

1840
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,970
What the fuck does the red one look like?

1841
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:30,770
I feel like the black one looks the coolest out of all of them.

1842
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:31,570
I'm not gonna lie.

1843
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,230
The black one actually...

1844
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,250
Oh, I can't tell.

1845
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:36,810
The yellow one just looks like...

1846
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:38,410
The yellow one does look like a banana.

1847
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:40,670
It does look like a banana.

1848
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,330
God, that looks so uncomfortable.

1849
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,110
What do you mean?

1850
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:50,530
It could be yours for $8700.

1851
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,050
It's so...

1852
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:54,010
What a steal.

1853
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:58,370
What a fucking steal, chat.

1854
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,210
Do they have it on eBay?

1855
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:02,630
Maybe I can get it cheaper on eBay.

1856
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:05,230
What if they have it on Keegee?

1857
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:12,610
Would it be funny if it was on Keegee?

1858
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:17,110
For those who don't know what Keegee is, it's basically the Canadian, like...

1859
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:18,750
What's the word?

1860
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:20,810
It's the Canadian...

1861
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:24,110
What's that American version called again?

1862
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:27,170
The one that got shut down because people were using it for...

1863
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:30,750
It was, like, really bad because people were using it for...

1864
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:33,130
For, like, anonymous hookups.

1865
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,290
And then they shut it down.

1866
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,130
The Craigslist!

1867
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:36,750
Yes!

1868
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:38,630
Yes!

1869
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:41,550
Anything but Keegee.

1870
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:43,610
It's the Canadian Craigslist.

1871
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:46,410
But there's no hookups.

1872
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:48,270
There's no hookups.

1873
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:56,270
You guys might not remember, but it sort of got low-key, like, shut down because people were using it for hookups.

1874
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:57,790
It's still alive and what?

1875
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:59,110
People still use Craigslist?

1876
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,010
Holy shit!

1877
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,650
Oh my god, they do!

1878
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:03,650
It still exists!

1879
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:06,710
Oh my god!

1880
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:09,210
Just nobody uses that anymore.

1881
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:10,230
Oh my god!

1882
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,410
Do they have the scorpion?

1883
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,910
Scorpion chair on Craigslist?

1884
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:17,090
Oh...

1885
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:21,090
Wait, I wanna look at Craigslist now.

1886
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:27,710
But what do they have in Craigslist then?

1887
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,350
What do they have?

1888
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:30,550
Oh my god, musicians?

1889
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:32,790
Alright, guys.

1890
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:33,870
What do we wanna learn?

1891
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:34,870
Local news.

1892
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,250
What's the local news for?

1893
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:39,310
Oh, it's for, like, people, like, doing yard sales and stuff.

1894
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:41,610
No Toki Craigslist.

1895
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:42,430
It's...

1896
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,270
It's...

1897
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:44,830
Toki...

1898
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:45,630
No...

1899
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:47,190
Guys!

1900
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:48,510
Maybe the...

1901
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:49,930
Maybe the fucking...

1902
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,310
Maybe they'll have the scorpion chair on Craigslist!

1903
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,810
You can buy musicians.

1904
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:56,670
You can, like...

1905
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:57,790
You can, like...

1906
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:58,570
There's child...

1907
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:02,310
Guys, I don't know about you, but, like, I don't think, like...

1908
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:09,170
I don't think, like, I would hire anybody for childcare on Craigslist.

1909
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:10,210
I'm sorry.

1910
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:11,570
But, like...

1911
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:12,850
I don't know.

1912
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:15,970
I feel like childcare is, like...

1913
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:17,950
Would not be for Craigslist.

1914
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:21,870
Just feels...

1915
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:24,890
Just feels a little sketchy.

1916
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:27,250
Yeah.

1917
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:32,690
There's, like, so many other better apps and websites for childcare that, like, I...

1918
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:34,850
No one should ever hire a nanny on there.

1919
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:38,350
Like, I'm sorry for anyone that puts childcare...

1920
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:40,710
Childcare listings on that website.

1921
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:43,330
Alright.

1922
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:48,370
Linus Tech Tips just did a garage sale and he sold his...

1923
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,290
What the fuck?

1924
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:50,550
Where does he live?

1925
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,190
But don't dox him.

1926
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:52,550
But...

1927
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:55,750
Is this information public?

1928
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:56,170
Like...

1929
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:57,750
Wait!

1930
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:59,290
I can buy the frog chair!

1931
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:00,810
Oh, you liar.

1932
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:01,770
You just sent me a picture.

1933
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:02,930
Frog...

1934
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:03,930
Frog...

1935
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:05,050
Froggy chair.

1936
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:06,790
Buy.

1937
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:09,590
Nox, thank you for the akasupa.

1938
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:10,650
Thank you, thank you.

1939
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:12,450
I hope you're doing well and moving and all.

1940
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:13,010
Thank you.

1941
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:13,570
Me too.

1942
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,990
I hope, like, I'll survive.

1943
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:16,130
Get ready.

1944
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:17,130
Akasupa.

1945
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,270
Thank you, thank you.

1946
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:22,290
Oh, my God.

1947
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,090
I'm so sad.

1948
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:25,730
I'm so fucking sad.

1949
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,610
You can't actually buy the frog chair.

1950
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:29,050
You fucking lied to me.

1951
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:30,430
Wait, I can.

1952
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:31,150
It's in Denmark.

1953
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:32,710
Oh, it got sold.

1954
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:34,030
God damn it.

1955
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,350
Wait, I can.

1956
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:36,770
But it's 3D print.

1957
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:37,430
It's so tiny.

1958
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:38,290
What am I fucking...

1959
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:38,950
What am I gonna do with it?

1960
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:39,670
Guys...

1961
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:42,430
Guys, I can buy the frog...

1962
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:43,530
Guys...

1963
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:44,670
Guys...

1964
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:47,890
I can buy the frog chair.

1965
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:51,510
Guys, for only $15.

1966
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,450
I can have the frog chair.

1967
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:57,350
What's the catch, you might ask?

1968
01:21:58,090 --> 01:21:58,850
Well...

1969
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,690
This is the catch.

1970
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,380
For $15.

1971
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,980
This could be mine.

1972
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,740
No, we're on the Etsy territory now.

1973
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,060
Oh, my God.

1974
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,720
But what if...

1975
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,140
Guys...

1976
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:24,500
Guys...

1977
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:25,500
Oh, no.

1978
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,420
We're on the Etsy territory.

1979
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,700
It's fucking over.

1980
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,420
Okay, guys.

1981
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,380
Guys, it's like $99.

1982
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,640
Do I do this?

1983
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,240
A $99 American dollars chat.

1984
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:42,180
This is $99 American dollars and I need your opinion.

1985
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,900
I need your opinion chat.

1986
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,140
Do I buy this rug?

1987
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:01,460
No, I'm fine.

1988
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:05,280
Guys, it's $99.

1989
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:07,320
Guys...

1990
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,400
I need a rug.

1991
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,800
I need a rug.

1992
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:13,840
No one's gonna...

1993
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,760
I won't have guests.

1994
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:15,380
But...

1995
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:16,340
Buy the...

1996
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,700
Frog chair.

1997
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:18,400
Toki.

1998
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,080
Now.

1999
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,520
Broken pot.

2000
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,700
Thank you for this super chat.

2001
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:22,100
Thank you.

2002
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:22,520
Thank you.

2003
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,000
Guys, it's only $99.

2004
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,240
Guys, there's only 10 left.

2005
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:30,700
Oh my god, 150 centimeters is like $900.

2006
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,140
Guys, how big is 150 centimeters?

2007
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:51,420
Guys, guys, I just didn't know how big is... guys, how big is 150 centimeters for the low, low price of $997?

2008
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,760
Is that a lot?

2009
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,320
Should I get that for my living room?

2010
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:58,820
A giant club penguin?

2011
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,300
A giant club penguin, right?

2012
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:04,840
For 150 centimeters?

2013
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,260
And then do I put it in my living room?

2014
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,120
And then...

2015
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:13,840
It would be really... am I really gonna do this?

2016
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:15,600
Guys...

2017
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:21,040
Don't... it looks like an old map.

2018
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,760
Oh my god, it's okay!

2019
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:23,980
We can get it.

2020
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,660
We can get it in yellow.

2021
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:35,860
Chat, dragoons, if the pink does not suit you, that's okay.

2022
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,500
Because it comes in yellow.

2023
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,380
Now we're talking.

2024
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:44,180
It's in yellow?

2025
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:46,940
My mind is now changed.

2026
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,160
Yellow, let's go.

2027
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,320
What's wrong with...

2028
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,700
What the fuck?

2029
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,680
Oh my god!

2030
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:08,050
I'm scared.

2031
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:13,130
Okay, I'm gonna... Okay, I don't wanna get like... I don't wanna get in trouble for showing this.

2032
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:13,970
So give me a sec.

2033
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:17,150
Let me censor this.

2034
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:20,010
I don't wanna get in trouble.

2035
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:23,410
I don't wanna get in trouble.

2036
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:27,370
I don't know what this is called.

2037
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:30,370
I don't know what this is called.

2038
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:30,630
God!

2039
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:33,390
Oh my god!

2040
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:39,550
This is God!

2041
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:43,810
Goodbye, scorpion chair, because I don't think we're gonna make our goal.

2042
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,770
I don't like it.

2043
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,850
This is God!

2044
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:51,750
They

2045
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:58,950
have this and Cloud Penguin!

2046
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:02,390
Why is that a thing?

2047
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,150
How many cells do they have?

2048
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:05,050
Okay, thank God.

2049
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,290
Like, their cells are mostly the Cloud Penguin.

2050
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:08,170
Right.

2051
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:10,490
Oh my god!

2052
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,430
How is this real?

2053
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:18,000
I'm star rating.

2054
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:18,860
It's good.

2055
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:22,280
Okay, guys, I don't... I don't know again.

2056
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:24,360
No!

2057
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,000
No!

2058
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:29,460
My recommended is so bad!

2059
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:32,680
It's so bad!

2060
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,280
Oh no!

2061
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:39,880
You guys wanna know how bad it is?

2062
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,180
Now they're showing me sexy rugs.

2063
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:44,520
Since I looked at the Nadia Pooh rug.

2064
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:46,020
Now...

2065
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,300
No, I can't.

2066
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,320
I literally would actually get banned off of YouTube if I show this to you guys right now.

2067
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:54,900
For the Cloud Penguin rug, buddy.

2068
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,420
Thank you for the super chat.

2069
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,260
Thank you, thank you.

2070
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:57,580
I...

2071
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:00,540
I actually... I actually think I would get banned.

2072
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:03,420
Honestly, I would get banned if I show this to you guys right now.

2073
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,880
Guys, we will buy one thing.

2074
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:10,160
Out of this entire stream, we will fucking purchase one...

2075
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,100
We will have a universal agreement.

2076
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:15,680
To be able to buy one item in the end.

2077
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,820
That's like... I'm not aiming for much.

2078
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:20,280
I just want one item.

2079
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,060
I just get the Club Penguin.

2080
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:24,040
I just...

2081
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:24,620
Please.

2082
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:28,280
We have to agree on one item.

2083
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,540
I just need one in the end.

2084
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,980
That's all I want.

2085
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,840
The Club...

2086
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,180
Okay, either the dog bed or the Club Penguin rug.

2087
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,000
Which...

2088
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:43,540
Which one?

2089
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,020
Oh my god.

2090
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,100
Okay, but I already have a bed.

2091
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:47,840
No, I can't do this.

2092
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:48,760
I already have a bed.

2093
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:50,880
I already have a bed.

2094
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,840
I can't do this to myself.

2095
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:55,180
Alright.

2096
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,040
Guys.

2097
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,780
Okay, I'm gonna let you guys pick.

2098
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,340
Alright.

2099
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:00,020
Club...

2100
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:01,180
We're gonna...

2101
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,980
Club Penguin rug.

2102
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:03,960
Or...

2103
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:05,540
Versus...

2104
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:06,660
Dog...

2105
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:07,960
Human...

2106
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:08,840
Bed...

2107
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:09,740
Club...

2108
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:10,700
Penguin...

2109
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,540
Rug...

2110
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:12,720
Dog...

2111
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,780
Human...

2112
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:14,280
Bed...

2113
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,020
And you know what?

2114
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:15,940
We'll add bonus.

2115
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,300
Frog...

2116
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,360
Frog chair for ants.

2117
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:22,900
For my...

2118
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:24,500
For rats.

2119
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,080
Okay.

2120
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,140
Okay.

2121
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:27,200
Alright.

2122
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:27,800
Here we go.

2123
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,180
This is it.

2124
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:29,640
This is...

2125
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,920
We're gonna get one item.

2126
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:34,460
In the end, we will get one item.

2127
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,880
In the end.

2128
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,280
The Club...

2129
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:38,600
Okay.

2130
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,940
I think the Club Penguin rug.

2131
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:41,700
Alright.

2132
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,140
But what size do we get?

2133
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,540
Guys.

2134
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:48,400
What size do we get for the Club Penguin rug?

2135
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:49,720
Like...

2136
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:57,700
This is like the most important thing we need to figure out.

2137
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,540
What the fuck is the size gonna be?

2138
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:05,300
Okay.

2139
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:06,660
There's multiple sizes.

2140
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,580
You can't be like that big anymore.

2141
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:14,880
This is the biggest one when there's literally like fucking 700 sizes for this.

2142
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:15,600
What color?

2143
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:15,900
Yellow?

2144
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:16,900
Are you gonna go with yellow?

2145
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,320
Is yellow like what we're sticking with guys?

2146
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:32,520
All right, it goes from 50 to 150.

2147
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,320
Are we doing this?

2148
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:45,060
Are we really getting 150 centimeters?

2149
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,900
Is this- is this really my legacy right now?

2150
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:54,800
Is this- guys, it is 997 dollars.

2151
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:55,700
U.S.

2152
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:56,260
by the way.

2153
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,640
We're not fucking around with Canadian paper money today.

2154
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:02,080
We are talking about the real money.

2155
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:07,300
We're talking about- we're talking about real money.

2156
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,560
We literally don't have any money.

2157
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:24,420
We're talking about the Next God.

2158
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:26,760
So even though we think it's okay wait.

2159
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:27,340
Don't f**k with me.

2160
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:27,460
Um away from you guys.

2161
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:31,360
Uh there's a' cents that I want to make into my beau tar pets guide.

2162
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:32,100
And I've got in that one.

2163
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:32,240
God, it's an encore theme.

2164
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:32,840
Okay.

2165
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:32,860
Okay.

2166
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,360
Okay.

2167
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:36,660
Okay.

2168
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:38,520
Okay.

2169
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,640
This is $900.

2170
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,440
This is $600.

2171
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:51,080
This is $1000 including shipping.

2172
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:55,180
This is $600 with free shipping.

2173
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,100
I'm donating more to help you out.

2174
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,240
Somebody was like, I voted for the frog chair.

2175
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:10,120
No, I said $997.

2176
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:14,560
$99?

2177
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,120
Guys, the $99 option is 50 centimeters.

2178
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:23,360
Are we gonna half-ass it at 50 centimeters, chat?

2179
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:24,940
Is this what you guys want?

2180
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,160
50 centimeters?

2181
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,240
Is this what you want?

2182
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:31,860
50 centimeters?

2183
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:31,860
Is this what you want?

2184
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:32,220
50 centimeters?

2185
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:32,220
Is this what you want?

2186
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:36,580
50 centimeters is...

2187
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:42,800
You guys want 50 centimeters?

2188
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:45,760
Okay,

2189
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:49,840
100.

2190
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,580
Are we compromising?

2191
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,140
Do we want 100 centimeters?

2192
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:58,640
100 centimeters is $339 American dollars, chat.

2193
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,600
Is this what we're going with?

2194
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,080
Alright.

2195
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,300
We're gonna have one more pull.

2196
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:04,700
Size...

2197
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,260
This is gonna be my one purchase.

2198
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,400
This is gonna be my only purchase today.

2199
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:12,360
Like...

2200
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:15,680
Size of the rug.

2201
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,040
Dog bed, please.

2202
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,320
50, 100, 150.

2203
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:25,800
For my apartment.

2204
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,240
My new apartment.

2205
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,320
It's a dog bed!

2206
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,760
100!

2207
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,140
I didn't have 100 for...

2208
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,840
There was like at one point...

2209
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,600
Holy shit.

2210
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,060
Biggest.

2211
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,300
Can you...

2212
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,300
I'm not gonna buy both.

2213
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:49,320
They're both not worth it.

2214
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,080
They're...

2215
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,040
I hope they're not...

2216
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,780
Both not worth it.

2217
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,260
None get the bed.

2218
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:58,440
Delay this.

2219
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,260
You're tired.

2220
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:00,560
This is...

2221
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,760
We're at the point in life where like...

2222
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,260
I am willing to buy...

2223
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:05,840
The most...

2224
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,000
The most fucking stupidest thing.

2225
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,560
Go big or go home.

2226
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:15,340
You did this to yourself.

2227
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:18,920
Doggy, please.

2228
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:19,420
No.

2229
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:22,780
The penguin will not bring a joy.

2230
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,340
Jeff Bezos doesn't win...

2231
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,880
Because this is actually on Etsy.

2232
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:32,940
The amount of money for this.

2233
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,560
1K penguin rug.

2234
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:38,860
I can't believe...

2235
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:38,980
You...

2236
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:39,620
Guys.

2237
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:46,920
All I'm saying is that you wanted me to spend $8,000 on a fucking scorpion chair.

2238
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:52,380
And now you're telling me the club penguin rug is not worth it?

2239
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,760
Pinky fucking lane.

2240
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:55,520
God.

2241
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,760
But that was funny.

2242
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,260
See if you can find it.

2243
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,140
The scorpion is functional.

2244
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,500
And worth it.

2245
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,980
The scorpion chair is cool.

2246
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,100
But it's...

2247
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:22,460
But it's a scorpion.

2248
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:23,700
Guys.

2249
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:31,320
You guys were willing for me to spend $8,000 for this.

2250
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,020
This was a business expense.

2251
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:38,960
Oh my god.

2252
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:39,480
Am I really?

2253
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,140
Guys.

2254
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:40,940
At least I didn't...

2255
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:42,680
At least I didn't do what, like, Ludwig did.

2256
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:45,420
And, like, Michael Reeves did.

2257
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,020
Where they give you guys access to the credit card.

2258
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,800
And then, like, you guys just bought whatever the fuck you want.

2259
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:51,820
Thank fucking god.

2260
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:52,500
Okay.

2261
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:52,960
That's...

2262
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:53,580
Okay.

2263
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:54,300
Doki.

2264
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:54,860
Oh, okay.

2265
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:55,800
Okay, okay, Doki.

2266
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:56,440
Pick a rug.

2267
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:57,880
That is perfect for your space.

2268
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:59,740
Nox, thank you for the akasupa.

2269
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,380
Thank you.

2270
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:00,800
Thank you.

2271
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:00,940
Guys.

2272
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:09,420
Unfortunately, the Kickstarter slash crowdfund was, uh, not a success.

2273
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:10,220
Guys.

2274
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:11,260
Yes.

2275
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,680
I don't know if you guys ever saw.

2276
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:18,320
But Ludwig, um, gave their credit card, uh, to the chat.

2277
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:19,800
Or, like, they made chat.

2278
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,140
They...

2279
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:23,300
They let chat buy any item they want.

2280
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:26,400
And, like, at least, like, I did not give you guys free will.

2281
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:27,680
And then...

2282
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:28,900
Thing is...

2283
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,000
Thing is...

2284
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:38,240
One of the purchases that they made on Ludwig's card was a fucking life-size Jackie Chan wax figure.

2285
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:44,000
And, like, at least that wasn't me.

2286
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,280
At least I...

2287
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,140
.

2288
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:46,160
.

2289
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:48,620
.

2290
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:59,040
At least I did not buy a life-size Jackie Chan wax figure and put it in my room.

2291
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:00,140
.

2292
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:02,640
Okay.

2293
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,100
But Michael made a sick video from it.

2294
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:05,380
Or...

2295
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:06,440
Thank you for the super chat.

2296
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:06,900
Thank you.

2297
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:07,480
Thank you.

2298
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:10,020
I'm not giving you guys my credit card information.

2299
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:11,140
Chat.

2300
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:12,180
I'm not.

2301
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,280
You guys keep...

2302
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:13,480
I...

2303
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,360
.

2304
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:18,500
If I did, somebody would have used it.

2305
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:18,600
I...

2306
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:18,760
.

2307
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,840
I would have used it to buy a fucking scorpion chair.

2308
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:21,640
.

2309
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:27,060
And it wouldn't be the only purchase that was made on the card.

2310
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:27,840
.

2311
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,420
You coward.

2312
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:30,860
Why not?

2313
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:32,620
.

2314
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,900
You know you will.

2315
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,140
.

2316
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:38,860
Let's buy...

2317
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:39,160
.

2318
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,320
Let's buy...

2319
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:40,420
.

2320
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:40,600
Yes.

2321
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:43,440
If we crowdfunded it, I would buy it.

2322
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:43,800
.

2323
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:44,360
If we...

2324
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:44,540
.

2325
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:46,240
If we crowdfunded eight...

2326
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:46,400
.

2327
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:46,540
...

2328
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:46,600
.

2329
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:46,840
...

2330
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:49,020
six K American, I would have bought it.

2331
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:52,300
Just for the fact that, like, you guys already gave me the money for it.

2332
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,840
.

2333
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:56,120
But, like, we didn't make it, guys.

2334
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:56,620
We...

2335
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:57,040
.

2336
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:57,120
We didn't.

2337
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:58,720
We didn't make it.

2338
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:03,480
So we have to pick between the penguin rug, or...

2339
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:03,700
.

2340
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,040
Or...

2341
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:06,300
.

2342
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:06,560
.

2343
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:06,960
.

2344
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,660
The dog-human bed.

2345
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,360
The lack of trust between us hurts a lot.

2346
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:12,660
.

2347
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:12,920
All right.

2348
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:13,560
All right.

2349
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:25,000
Lay, would you or would you not buy the scorpion chair and if I gave you the credit card information, would you or would you not?

2350
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:31,260
I'm waiting.

2351
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,840
Alright, I've already lost track of Lay.

2352
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:42,520
I'm so tired.

2353
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,160
I've lost track.

2354
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,000
Did they even give an answer?

2355
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,540
I can't even tell.

2356
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,840
I can't even tell if they gave an answer.

2357
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,040
Are they saying yes or no?

2358
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:57,880
Or were they a coward and they ran away?

2359
01:37:58,060 --> 01:37:59,020
Fucking coward.

2360
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,160
You know I was right.

2361
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:01,080
That's why you ran away.

2362
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:02,420
You know I was right.

2363
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,800
You didn't want to lie to me.

2364
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:10,580
You didn't even have the gall to give me an answer.

2365
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:11,900
Yes!

2366
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,160
They said yes?

2367
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,140
They said yes?

2368
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:19,320
NDA, sorry.

2369
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,180
Thank you for the super chat.

2370
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:24,380
Alright, we're buying the club penguin rug.

2371
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,040
We've done it.

2372
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,220
This is our...

2373
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:29,960
Alright, 150 centimeters.

2374
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,000
Alright, that is a giant ass rug.

2375
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,300
I'm going to put this in my living room.

2376
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,320
That's literally going to be the only furniture we have.

2377
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:39,120
Wait, what?

2378
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,860
Okay, I'm scared.

2379
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:42,100
Okay, I'm scared.

2380
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:42,800
I'm actually fucking scared.

2381
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,520
What do you mean by check my donations?

2382
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:45,180
I'm...

2383
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:53,320
What do you mean?

2384
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:54,980
Next scene.

2385
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,200
Okay, alright.

2386
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,740
Let's see.

2387
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:00,460
Oh no.

2388
01:39:03,890 --> 01:39:05,710
Okay, we didn't make it.

2389
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:10,790
Next scene, thank you for the...

2390
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:14,290
Thank you for the $500 donation.

2391
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:17,630
Buy the human-sized dog bed, too.

2392
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:18,450
Thank you.

2393
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:19,290
Oh my God.

2394
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:21,090
Thank you so much for the $500.

2395
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:23,210
Okay, you scared me there.

2396
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:26,070
I thought somebody actually donated $6,000.

2397
01:39:26,590 --> 01:39:29,870
And like, it's going to make me buy the scorpion chair.

2398
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:34,750
Like, that bit, I thought somebody was actually going to actually do it.

2399
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:36,110
Thank fucking God.

2400
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:38,550
I was going to be like...

2401
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:40,270
I made it so that...

2402
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:43,630
Oh, it's the end of the stream because I was hoping that we would never make it.

2403
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:45,110
So like, thank fucking God.

2404
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:52,550
I don't even know where to put the scorpion chair.

2405
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:53,710
That's the thing.

2406
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:54,950
Like, where the fuck...

2407
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:56,890
I'm not going to put my monitor.

2408
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:59,410
I'm not going to actually gain from it.

2409
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:06,110
I don't want to die from being crushed by the monitors of my scorpion chair.

2410
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:07,230
So...

2411
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:10,590
But I don't actually want you to suffer that much.

2412
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:12,030
Next scene, thank you for the super chat.

2413
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:12,430
Thank you.

2414
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:13,550
Alright.

2415
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:13,710
Alright.

2416
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:14,890
In my scorpion...

2417
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:16,310
Sorry, my banana scorpion.

2418
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:17,990
Um...

2419
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:27,810
But I will buy both the 150 centimeters Club Penguin rug and also the dog human dog bed.

2420
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:29,670
And I'll take a picture of both and the same.

2421
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:31,270
I'll put the dog human dog bed...

2422
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:32,030
Actually, no.

2423
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:33,130
Because then you won't see the Club Penguin.

2424
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:34,450
I'll put it next to the Club Penguin.

2425
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:38,790
So you'll see how fucking big the Club Penguin rug is.

2426
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:39,610
Alright.

2427
01:40:39,730 --> 01:40:42,370
I'll make my purchase, like, after this stream.

2428
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,850
And then I'll take a picture of it.

2429
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:46,650
I love you.

2430
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:48,630
Go buy whatever you need.

2431
01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:50,550
Nox, thank you for the super chat.

2432
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:50,970
Thank you.

2433
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:51,410
Thank you.

2434
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:51,970
You know what?

2435
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:53,870
That was very productive, chat.

2436
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,810
Buy the frog chair.

2437
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:56,370
Okay.

2438
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:58,610
I'll buy the frog chair too.

2439
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:01,150
Cass, thank you for the magenta sofa.

2440
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:01,890
Thank you.

2441
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:02,450
Thank you.

2442
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:04,670
I will buy the Club Penguin...

2443
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:06,470
We were very productive today, chat.

2444
01:41:06,950 --> 01:41:08,170
Not only...

2445
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:10,970
Not only did we buy some furniture.

2446
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:12,350
We bought...

2447
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:17,090
We bought three pieces of furniture together to decorate...

2448
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:19,910
To decorate our apartment together.

2449
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:23,610
The voting meant nothing.

2450
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:24,210
Wow.

2451
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:26,270
This is also a lesson to everybody.

2452
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:31,630
That in the end, your vote doesn't...

2453
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:31,790
Okay.

2454
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:33,030
That's a bad lesson.

2455
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:34,090
That...

2456
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:38,130
It was an illusion of choice.

2457
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:42,330
Choices don't win.

2458
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:42,690
Choices matter.

2459
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:46,870
Anyway.

2460
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:50,170
I'm fucking tired.

2461
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:51,350
So I'm going to call it here.

2462
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:55,050
I hope you guys had a lot of fun today.

2463
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:57,090
Hanging out with me.

2464
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:58,990
And fucking around.

2465
01:41:59,370 --> 01:42:01,490
And buying furniture for us.

2466
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:04,850
Buying furniture and everything.

2467
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:08,370
I really did enjoy it so much.

2468
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:09,510
Just hanging around.

2469
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:10,970
And messing about.

2470
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,230
And...

2471
01:42:12,230 --> 01:42:12,310
And...

2472
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:14,890
And actually purchasing some stuff for...

2473
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:23,610
Definitely buying some stuff to furnish the empty apartment.

2474
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:24,650
And it was a lot of fun.

2475
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:25,570
It was a lot of fun.

2476
01:42:26,330 --> 01:42:27,430
I'm going to call it here.

2477
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:28,510
No stream tomorrow.

2478
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:29,210
Because it's Sunday.

2479
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:30,710
And no stream on Monday.

2480
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:31,490
Because I'm fucking...

2481
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:33,610
I'm fucking tired.

2482
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:35,590
I need the rest.

2483
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:36,410
Anyway.

2484
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:37,450
I'm going to call it here, everybody.

2485
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:38,330
As always, everyone.

2486
01:42:38,510 --> 01:42:39,190
Stay hydrated.

2487
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:40,010
Posture check.

2488
01:42:40,190 --> 01:42:41,130
Get up and move around.

2489
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,230
To get that blood flowing.

2490
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:42,310
Bye.

2491
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:43,390
And if you stay up for me.

2492
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:45,310
Head to bed.

2493
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:46,290
Because you deserve it.

2494
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,470
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2495
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:48,850
Bye, guys.

2496
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:50,270
Bye.
