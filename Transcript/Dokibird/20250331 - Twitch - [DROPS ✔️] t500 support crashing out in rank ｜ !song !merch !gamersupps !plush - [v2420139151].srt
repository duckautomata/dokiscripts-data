Also shout out to the minecraft story mode clip Yeah, that's great.

48
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:34,260
I feel like every year there's always like one clip of mine that goes out of like the vtuber sphere and into an anormous fear and Today like this year is the minecraft pig dying and like I was looking at the quote retweet I was looking at the quote tweet retweets and like the comments and stuff.

49
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,460
Um, it has Transcended language barriers and has hit the Spanish commute minecraft

50
00:05:47,700 --> 00:06:08,200
Like Spanish minecraft like the Spanish minecraft Twitter community is talking about it now, too I was like it's actually transcended language border like language barriers because like Minecraft pig dying does not need like Does not need like a bear a barrier when it comes to language

51
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,460
Navi thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

Thank you.

55
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:45,700
Thank you the fact I turned into like I knew it was gonna happen It just it still hit me for so I guess cuz like death was just I don't know like like how I didn't know how He was gonna die I knew I saw the clip of him dying before I played the game because that was like the whole reason why I wanted to Play the game because I saw that clip before and it was so fucking funny And I was like,

56
00:06:45,840 --> 00:07:14,200
I need to play this game to go experience that moment But like the how it happened I was not expecting that and it actually like hit me and now I've and then I momentarily forgot that he would turn into a porkchop because I was like Oh my god, cuz like I fucked around and was like what if I just don't catch him and I did that and then I did Not know he was gonna die right after I did that Oh my god,

57
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,680
it was supposed to be a joke before it actually happened

58
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,820
Because I was like wait, it was just a prank

59
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:47,210
Um But yeah, like that's why that definitely hit me a lot harder than it should have Because I was not expecting it to actually happen.

60
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,410
I thought it was just I thought it was just you know, funny Haha moment.

61
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,010
Oh gee.

62
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,350
Thank you.

63
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,690
Let's hear.

64
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,310
What's up?

65
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:54,650
Thank you.

66
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,510
Thank you.

67
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,110
And yeah, thank you for the 21 biddies Thank you, honey lies.

68
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,410
Um, oh yeah also, um, um, I think I might have sleep apnea

69
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:19,670
So, you know how there's a I know that comes out of fucking norm out of nowhere but like, okay So like, um, I knew I knew I snore.

70
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:42,010
Okay, so like I know I snore I Didn't know how loud my snoring it was Until like, uh Until like I had like a sleepover with a friend and then she was like your snoring is like so fucking loud I was like, oh no, because my dad's snoring is really really loud.

71
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,870
I didn't think I inherited that from him.

72
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,790
So like

73
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,770
No Oh

74
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:12,830
Okay, I didn't tell you guys this so the reason I'm talking about sleep apnea It's cuz you know how there was that viral video of that guy doing his morning routine and like when he wakes up He has that no strip stuff that he knows that He has that no strip stuff and everything.

75
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,730
So oh my god Thank you for the 50

76
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,970
Thank you guys thank you all for the support guys, I really appreciate it.

77
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,450
Thank you.

78
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:48,730
Anyway, so So like so there was that morning roots that viral clip of that guy doing his fucking more morning routine and everybody makes fun of it But then I saw him But the thing is the thing I took away from that morning routine is I see him do those like nose nose strips stuff I've always thought like does that actually work?

79
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,210
Because like um So I ordered them.

80
00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:02,110
I like I actually I was like looking it up cuz I was like, oh my god Okay, wait, I snore and like I mouth breathe a lot when I sleep.

81
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,690
So I was like, okay Maybe maybe I should actually try one of these like those things the nose strip like that.

82
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,410
What do you call it?

83
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:23,790
I don't remember what they're at the actual name like this those tape the nose tape thing to like enlarge the nose hole though Fucking the nasal holes so you breathe more from your nose instead of your mouth.

84
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,110
So no, it's a tape Yeah, I don't even know what you're called nasal strips.

85
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,670
I don't know

86
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,290
So like hmm So like I want to try it out.

87
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:42,450
It's outside my door right now cuz I I Bought it two days like I ordered it a couple of days ago.

88
00:10:42,550 --> 00:11:00,150
I still haven't picked it up and tried it yet Um, cuz I got But it's supposed to like make it so that I was looking it up I was looking it up and it's supposed to make you breathe through your nose more to prevent snoring and like I've noticed Recently,

89
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:12,710
um when I'm snoring because I know I snore I know I snore but I didn't know how loud it was until like My friend recorded me while sleeping and then she showed it to me and then she's like this is what it's like outside my door

90
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:38,210
And like this is what it's like in my room and this is what it's like outside my door I was like I didn't tell you guys this cuz I was embarrassed but now that I got Now

91
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,170
That I'm not gonna show you guys.

92
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,410
It's so embarrassing.

93
00:11:45,670 --> 00:12:08,950
It's actually so embarrassing I didn't tell you guys this before because I was so embarrassed and but now that I have a cure for it potentially But it's just the audio I now that potentially have the cure for it by using the Nasal the nasal tape whatever

94
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:32,930
Okay I'm gonna test it out tonight and see if, like, well, I want... the way to know is that if my, my, so, like, recently, I've noticed, also, like, noticed that, not recently, but when I was sick during that, like, when I was sick, like, for the couple months,

95
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:46,870
for a couple months, it's got a lot worse in terms of my snoring and, like, my mouth breathing because, um, my throat has been, like, feeling really dry lately, which hasn't happened before.

96
00:12:46,870 --> 00:13:02,150
I think it got worse because of my sickness because I've been sick for a while, so my throat felt, like, even more agitated, so I was like, fuck, okay, I actually might need to try this out because, like, to prevent, like, drying my throat even more from snoring.

97
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:21,770
And then, today, I had, like, these shower thoughts, but, like, in bed, and I was like, I should, what if, because I was like, what if I do have sleep apnea because, like, I was really scared because, like, I was thinking sleep apnea, from what I remember,

98
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,210
or, like, when I googled it, was that it, like, you breathe, you, you stop breathing.

99
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,270
You know?

100
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:50,950
I don't know if I have sleep apnea, I know I snore, and my snores are really loud, and so I was like, I don't know if I actually have sleep apnea, but it, like, it's, like, similar to snoring and stuff, so you know when you have, yes, so, like, um, I've never,

101
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,990
like, I've never woken up from my sleep before.

102
00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:12,170
Um, I know I'm an incredibly heavy sleeper because, like, I've slept through multiple alarms, and, like, I don't even remember me turning my alarms off, so, like, if I have an alarm, I put my phone, like, off my bed, so, like, to wake wake me up.

103
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:27,350
So, so, like, when I wake up, I actually have to, like, grab my phone, like, get out of my bed to grab my phone to turn off my alarm, because if I don't do that, I would sleep turn off my alarm, and I have no recollection of it.

104
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,090
I would have no fucking recollection of me ever turning off my alarm.

105
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:46,530
So, I know I sleep really deep, and, but the thing is, um, I don't know if I actually have sleep apnea, but I got scared.

106
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:58,750
I got scared, because, um, because I'm, like, you stop breathing, and you know what happens when you stop breathing?

107
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,970
You lose oxygen in your brain.

108
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:15,830
So, I was, like, oh, my God, what if I'm getting more and more stupid every day?

109
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:25,810
What if I've been getting more and more stupid every day because of the lack of oxygen in my brain?

110
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,810
So, I got really scared.

111
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,130
I was, like, oh, my God, am I getting dumber?

112
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,830
Is that why?

113
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:45,130
So, I'm, like, I feel, like, I feel, like, I'm getting more stupid.

114
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,470
I feel, like, I'm getting dumber.

115
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,010
Is it because I'm having less oxygen in my brain?

116
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,930
Is that possible?

117
00:15:51,470 --> 00:16:03,810
So, that's why, that's the whole thought process with why I got nasal strips, because I was, like, oh, my God, what if I'm getting more, what if I'm depriving my brain of oxygen?

118
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,770
I should really order this and try it out.

119
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:14,890
And it's all because of that fucking viral clip of that guy doing his morning routine.

120
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:15,750
I...

121
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,150
So, I had to try it out.

122
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,590
I was, like, I can't, I can't get worse.

123
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,450
I can't, I can't get worse.

124
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,130
Anyway, Pughead, thank you for the gifted sub to LackyOxygen.

125
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,690
Thank you, thank you.

126
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,410
Love, thank you for the hundred bitties.

127
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,030
No, thank you for another hundred bitties.

128
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,650
Cobalt, thank you for the hundred bitties.

129
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,850
And Pughead, thank you for the five gifted subs.

130
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,610
Thank you, thank you.

131
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,930
Oh, my God, there's so many.

132
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,870
Thank you, guys.

133
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,930
Mighty, thank you for tier one.

134
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,670
Matt, uh, Tasty, and Dad, thank you for the hundred bitties.

135
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,750
Thank you, thank you.

136
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,110
Okay, not against sleep.

137
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,870
Nasal shifts only help against normal snoring.

138
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,330
Not...

139
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,970
Okay, so that's why, because I don't know if I actually have sleep apnea.

140
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,710
I know I snore, but I don't know if I'm not breathing.

141
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,130
That's the biggest issue.

142
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,310
I can't tell.

143
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,510
Because, like, I don't wake up from snoring.

144
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,890
I get, like, sleep.

145
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,850
I don't know if I wake up from snoring, so I don't know if I just stop breathing.

146
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,630
Like, I can't tell.

147
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:33,290
So, like, I'm gonna try the nasal strip to see if I feel any better.

148
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,050
To see if I feel any better.

149
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,370
And if I do, then I fix the problem.

150
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:48,490
Then I don't have sleep apnea.

151
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,230
Oh, I don't grind my teeth.

152
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,250
I don't grind it.

153
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,930
So, like, that's why I know I don't.

154
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,610
Because when I've been to the dentist, and they have never...

155
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,710
Every time I've been to the dentist, I've never had, like, teeth grinding issues.

156
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,370
So, anyway.

157
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,590
Alright, let's see.

158
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,250
Okay, we need... Oh, I have four rolls!

159
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,010
Let's go!

160
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,650
I need to get my venom shit.

161
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,290
Alright, let's see.

162
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,550
People seem to know that you... People seem to say that you would know if you had it.

163
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:18,990
I don't know.

164
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,690
I'm pretty stupid.

165
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,670
I don't know if that comes from... No.

166
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,670
If that came from...

167
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,010
The la...

168
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,830
It came from my brain being deprived of oxygen?

169
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,310
Or, like...

170
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,070
I can't tell.

171
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,270
I actually, legitimately can't tell where it's from.

172
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,550
So, we'll see how it goes.

173
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,590
I'm gonna try out the nasal strips and see if I do get better.

174
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,510
If I do get better, then, like, I have nothing to worry about.

175
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,230
Anyway, guys.

176
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,070
Let me warm up real quick before we... Okay, I have... I need, like, where am I?

177
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,250
One, two, three.

178
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,330
Okay, I have three more.

179
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,030
And then, I'll get my... What are the goals?

180
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,990
Okay, I have three more.

181
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,290
And then, I can get... Then, I can get my venom emote.

182
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,990
The fucking thing where he's twerking.

183
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,110
I wish that emote was universal.

184
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,290
I wish they gave that emote to every character.

185
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,930
Every male character.

186
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,470
Cause, you gotta admit, it looks better on the male superheroes.

187
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:27,350
Cause, I wish I could do that for, like... Cause, I saw the ones where it was only the male characters.

188
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,550
No, no, no.

189
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,650
Just the males.

190
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,010
Cause, I think it's funnier.

191
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,110
Cause, it's April Fools!

192
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,810
It's not Sexy Fools!

193
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,650
It's April Fools!

194
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:50,350
So, I feel like... When I saw it on the Hulk and Groot, I was like... I felt like it would've been so much better if it could be on all the male characters.

195
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,490
Cause, I wish I could have it on... I wish it was real on the Hulk and Groot.

196
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,910
Cause, I saw the videos of it.

197
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,810
And I was like, oh my god.

198
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,070
It's more funny on the Hulk than it was on Venom.

199
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,030
It's so sexy!

200
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:19,590
Okay, but could you imagine if we... If we could see a Mr. Fantastic throw it back for Sue?

201
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,410
Come on, think about that.

202
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,670
Alright, what do I need?

203
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,770
I need three... I technically... I need three more roles.

204
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,050
Okay, the Punisher.

205
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,110
I'll do, like, two quick plays for this.

206
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,910
Um, the Punisher.

207
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,310
I'll do the Punisher, actually.

208
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,030
Eh, Storm.

209
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,350
I can play quick play Storm.

210
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,770
And defeat 25.

211
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,190
Yeah, quick play Storm.

212
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,010
Um... Wait, if I do Punisher, I get both of these.

213
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,150
Wait, no, Storm.

214
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,510
Okay, if I just play Storm.

215
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,950
Yeah, or play Hela.

216
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,430
Wait, Hela... Is there another Hela one?

217
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,270
Hela... Hela... Hela... Okay.

218
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,770
No, Storm is the easy... Storm is so fucking easy.

219
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,970
Alright, give me a sec.

220
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,010
I want to see if I can... I'll do two quick plays on Storm and see if I can get it.

221
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,320
There are tournament matches today?

222
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,640
I do not care about competitive that much.

223
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,180
Unless the team recruits me as a mascot, I don't care.

224
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,580
I joked about it.

225
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:24,140
I was like, what if, like, you could just put... Apparently, um... Apparently, um, you can be put on the teams and just not do anything.

226
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:32,780
And I was like, okay, I would... I wish I could... They could just, like, put me there and just... I just received the top five thing.

227
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:39,060
Like, you know the... You know, like, the... The little banner they receive by placing, um, in the MRC?

228
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,920
And then they actually... Even if you didn't participate, it... Because managers get it too.

229
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,900
Like, from what I've seen, like, I was like, wait, this person has, like, the top four.

230
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,180
And I asked about it and they're like, oh, that's just, like, one of the staff members.

231
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,580
And I was like, you can do that?

232
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,440
You could just, like, not...

233
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,620
You know what?

234
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,320
You don't have to do anything at all.

235
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,660
And you just receive it?

236
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,320
Just because you're staff?

237
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,300
I was like, oh my god.

238
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,210
I wish I could have... I wish they could just put me on the team and then...

239
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,720
Yeah, I could be, like, the mascot, you know?

240
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,420
I'll watch party you.

241
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:28,120
Like, Shroud's on his team thing and he's gonna get, like, a fucking top five shit?

242
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,140
Like...

243
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,740
I mean, he funds the team, but, like, I could just watch it.

244
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,380
I could watch it.

245
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,080
Like, watch the matches.

246
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,920
Man, is that not enough?

247
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,100
Oh my god, so demanding.

248
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,920
Is that not enough?

249
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,960
Watching is not...

250
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,480
He's Shroud.

251
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,680
Yeah, I'm the Shroud of Vtubers.

252
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,100
I could be the Shroud of Vtubers.

253
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,200
You don't know that.

254
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,800
If they put me on the team, I will become the Shroud of Vtubers.

255
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,840
Obviously, like, I don't want to go up.

256
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,500
I should go up because I did that.

257
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,320
There we go.

258
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,660
One.

259
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,380
I got one, guys.

260
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,080
Here we go.

261
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,460
Come on, give me that two.

262
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,300
That's great.

263
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,100
Two.

264
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,180
Three.

265
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,220
I need my April Fool's emote.

266
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,360
V Shroud.

267
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,400
Are you gonna pay, like, Shroud?

268
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,200
Alright, guys, if I ever get a multi-million dollar deal, I will make my own Vtuber...

269
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,920
I'll make my own Rivals team.

270
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,360
If I ever get a fucking multi-million dollar deal, guys.

271
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,040
That's the dream right there.

272
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:55,480
I'll turn all these pro players into Vtubers and then, like, create my Rivals team.

273
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,880
I'll be called... what's his name?

274
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,340
This was Shroud X, right?

275
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,220
Jokey X.

276
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,680
Just fuck you in particular.

277
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,900
I need that kill.

278
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,600
Alright.

279
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,360
Hello, he's healing me.

280
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,260
Oh my...

281
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,640
Okay, I deserve that.

282
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,500
Okay,

283
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,240
that was my bad.

284
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,300
That was my bad.

285
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,600
Alright, five out of twenty.

286
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,600
That's okay.

287
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,660
We're almost there.

288
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,000
We need twenty more.

289
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,620
Yeah, that happens to Shroud too.

290
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,320
You think he's fucking invincible?

291
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,260
He's not invulnerable, guys.

292
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,020
He can bleed.

293
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,160
He's not perfect.

294
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,600
That's why he's Shroud.

295
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,560
Can we get closer, please?

296
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,340
Like, what am I supposed to do?

297
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,180
How am I gonna supposed to get my Venom Twerk emote if you're not closer?

298
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,860
Please, I'm playing quick play just for the... I'm gonna kill this Punisher.

299
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,820
I know you're here.

300
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,440
Okay, okay, I knew he was here, but I didn't know he was there.

301
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,140
Okay, okay, he knew that I knew apparently.

302
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,960
That's unfortunate.

303
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,320
He knew that I knew that he knew.

304
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,780
That's so fucked up.

305
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,640
How did he know?

306
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,880
That I knew that he knew.

307
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,060
That's so messed up.

308
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,140
How the fuck am I?

309
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,620
Please.

310
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,460
I need twenty more.

311
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,520
Please.

312
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,800
You're right.

313
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,060
I'm not aiming right now because of my sleep apnea because of the lack of oxygen in my brain at the moment.

314
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,280
That should be my perfect excuse.

315
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,740
Like, I'm sorry.

316
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,840
I have sleep apnea.

317
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,560
Um, I'm diagnosed by the way.

318
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,020
I have undiagnosed sleep apnea.

319
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,200
Oh my god.

320
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,920
Oh my god, use this to live.

321
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,160
Please.

322
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,240
There we go.

323
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,940
Nice.

324
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,620
I don't think I'm gonna get healed, but guys, by the way, I have no descend key.

325
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,340
I have to look down.

326
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:35,560
I don't have my descend key bounded.

327
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,440
I actually have to look down.

328
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,940
There we go.

329
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:40,720
Okay.

330
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,740
All right.

331
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:48,280
My descend key is on my I need healing because I think that is um, that is much more important.

332
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,340
That is much more important than anything else.

333
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,320
All right.

334
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,860
It's the ping was so 20 20.

335
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,740
It's the lack of oxygen.

336
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,400
It's true.

337
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,820
It could be true.

338
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,020
It's undiagnosed.

339
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,700
But it could be true.

340
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,520
It's a possibility, you know, it's all about the possibility.

341
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,280
Okay, nice.

342
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,180
Do they have triple tank?

343
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,840
No, they had four tanks.

344
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,160
How is four tanks gonna do anything for you?

345
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,900
You have you have one raccoon.

346
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,600
Okay, nice.

347
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,960
Oh no, I need nine more.

348
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,640
Oh my god, you guys were supposed to cap this so I can get my fucking venom twerk.

349
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,220
Kill him, kill him, please, please, no!

350
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,620
When it's convenient.

351
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,760
All right, nice.

352
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,320
Yeah!

353
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,640
No!

354
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,220
I need 10.

355
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,100
I need like 10 more.

356
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,760
They were supposed to fucking push through!

357
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,540
Please!

358
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,400
Okay, I need, okay, I need more.

359
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,440
Okay, I need less and then thank fucking god.

360
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,280
All right.

361
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,600
The next one I'll get it.

362
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,280
Strange out there you live.

363
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,400
Uh, cannon, thank you for the twitch prime.

364
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:15,780
Thank you.

365
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,560
Thank you.

366
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,460
Uh, rose, thank you for the twitch prime.

367
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:19,760
Thank you.

368
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Thank you.

369
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:20,860
Peace.

370
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,360
Thank you for the hundred biddies.

371
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:22,740
Thank you.

372
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,300
Thank you.

373
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,320
You're so cool, bro.

374
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,260
I mean, I didn't watch Annoying Bell until the vtuber wars, but you're funny and you have amazing energy.

375
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,200
Keep it up.

376
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,220
Oh, thank you.

377
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,660
I really appreciate it.

378
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,760
I'm glad you enjoyed my content.

379
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,660
Thank you, it's the lack of oxygen in the brain.

380
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,700
I appreciate it.

381
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,100
You know, you know, it's like those hats where it's like, um, sorry, I'm blank.

382
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,580
Uh, I suffer from blank or something.

383
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,400
Sorry.

384
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,980
I self-diagnosed myself with sleep apnea and I think I have, I think I'm depriving my brain of oxygen.

385
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,300
Please be patient.

386
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,600
I am oxygen deprived.

387
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,220
That's me.

388
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,540
Someone make me a hat.

389
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,300
I'll wear it.

390
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,220
I'll wear it on stream.

391
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,240
All right.

392
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,260
Sorry for those who are watching at four in the morning.

393
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,100
I took like a five hour nap and here I am.

394
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:36,340
I was gonna do this like earlier, but then but then I decided to deprive my brain of more oxygen today.

395
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,420
Please be patient.

396
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,820
I'm a vtuber.

397
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,220
All right, here we go.

398
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Please, I mean, like how- you're not hiding.

399
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,320
You're so big.

400
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,480
You're literally the thing.

401
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,100
Like, what did you expect?

402
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,880
Oh, that's unfortunate to the group.

403
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,540
That's very unfortunate, but I'm saying like, where are you hiding from?

404
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,300
I forgot I was on speed.

405
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:05,760
Whoops.

406
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Attentional, of course.

407
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,840
Where did they go?

408
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,740
Okay, that's one.

409
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,920
Don't worry, that's two more.

410
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,360
We're almost there.

411
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,820
Get over here.

412
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,800
I'm gonna kill you too.

413
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,700
Get over here.

414
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,560
I need one more.

415
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,620
There you go.

416
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,860
Don't- oh, you think you're gonna run?

417
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,120
Jeff, you think- oh, he is.

418
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,940
He's aiming.

419
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,440
He's- wait, you kidding me?

420
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,000
Okay, not aiming anymore.

421
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,520
There we go.

422
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,920
Okay, he's getting healed.

423
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,020
That's not fair, but the raccoon's not getting healed.

424
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,060
Wait.

425
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,800
Something- oh shit.

426
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,040
Okay, that's shooting me.

427
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,720
I was like, what's hitting me right now?

428
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,800
Okay, let me sit here on the cart.

429
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,060
I can just farm this here.

430
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,940
I can just do this.

431
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,780
I'll just shoot on the cart and then- Oh!

432
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,320
Okay.

433
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,900
I knew it.

434
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,940
I was like, I knew it.

435
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,700
I should have stayed in the air.

436
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,020
Oh my god, it's okay.

437
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,740
We won it.

438
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,520
Am I on speed or- no, I'm on speed.

439
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,340
I start on speed.

440
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,360
Guys, this is how long I have not played Storm.

441
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,740
Alright, guys, it's okay.

442
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,080
They- it's okay.

443
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,720
I was just bait for my team, as always.

444
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,060
Oh my god, we're gonna take- it's okay.

445
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,740
For the Venom twerking mode.

446
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,140
For the Venom twerking mode.

447
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,060
Do it for him.

448
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,920
Do it for him.

449
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,260
You know what?

450
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,900
Fuck it.

451
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,480
Fuck it.

452
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,140
I'm gonna kill just the Raccoon.

453
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
Um, why is he still alive?

454
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,640
Oh, thank god I'm in the air.

455
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,200
Also, but why am I- why was he still alive?

456
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,580
Who the fuck was I hitting?

457
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,260
Okay.

458
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,900
Oh no, where's that?

459
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,480
Where's that?

460
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,940
I can't tell where that is.

461
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,280
Where is he?

462
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,060
I- I did damage to him.

463
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,160
Apparently, I did damage.

464
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,460
Where the fuck was he?

465
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,000
Okay, get in faster.

466
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,500
Where the fuck did he go?

467
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,820
Oh wait, that's not- I don't have to send he.

468
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,740
I need to remember that.

469
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,860
Get over here.

470
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,540
That's fucking right.

471
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,340
Get over here.

472
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,860
Okay, nice.

473
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,560
Back to speed, I go.

474
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,640
Let me stay in the air.

475
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,320
They can't hit me if I'm in the air.

476
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,740
Nice.

477
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,380
All right, I'm doing it.

478
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,140
Oh, I made it.

479
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,160
I did it.

480
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,320
I could leave right now.

481
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:40,620
Oh, wait.

482
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,520
No, you can't.

483
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,920
Apparently, I found out you can't just leave after you got your achievement.

484
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,660
You actually have to stay.

485
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,380
Like, I have to stay and not fuck over my team?

486
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,760
That's so fucked up.

487
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,500
I'm only here for achievements.

488
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,800
Okay, you know what?

489
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,940
Fuck this one guy in particular.

490
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,040
I'm coming for you.

491
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,780
I'm coming for you.

492
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,860
Wait, wait, what the fuck?

493
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,640
Oh, I- I'm coming.

494
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,340
Can't run away.

495
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,200
That going invisible is gonna save you.

496
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,780
Oh shit.

497
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,280
Goodbye.

498
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,720
Okay, it did save him.

499
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,320
It did save him.

500
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,700
All right, it's all right.

501
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,620
We're back.

502
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,600
All right, I'm back.

503
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,760
There we go.

504
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,760
Yeah, we're winning and I'll do it again.

505
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,560
Put you on a fucking sandwich.

506
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
All right, I did my job.

507
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,160
I can just sit here.

508
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,280
I don't have to try anymore.

509
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,160
That should be three, right?

510
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,580
That should be like, three points.

511
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,960
Like, enough for three rolls.

512
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,680
Oh shit.

513
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,220
No!

514
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,120
How high do I have to go to get the spawn?

515
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,260
No!

516
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,220
Wait, he doesn't know I can fly.

517
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,500
He doesn't know we can all fly.

518
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,960
Fucking stupid.

519
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,920
He could have went to spawn and killed us.

520
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,380
Stupid.

521
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,160
Even when I'm oxygen deprived, I know that.

522
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,560
He literally got Thor in me.

523
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,620
He threw him in me.

524
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,280
Like, how did he die?

525
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,300
SillyBishop jumped off.

526
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,560
Yeah, I was like, what?

527
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,960
Oh shit, I did.

528
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,300
Yay!

529
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,580
Most damage with one final hit.

530
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,220
Let's go.

531
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,820
That was a team player.

532
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,740
Yeah, okay.

533
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,440
All right.

534
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,080
Oh, that's a lot.

535
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,360
Wait, that's actually a lot.

536
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,820
Wait, do I got it?

537
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,860
I almost got 1500 damage.

538
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,460
Oh, okay.

539
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,860
Let's see how much, how many rolls I got from that.

540
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,080
Oh my god, is that it?

541
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,220
Is that it?

542
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,460
Wait, what?

543
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,080
Why did it say zero?

544
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,490
What?

545
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,540
Wait, what?

546
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,800
What?

547
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,700
Why did it say, why did it say zero?

548
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:35,720
What?

549
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,020
Oh my god, I forgot it's orbs.

550
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,200
I forgot it's orbs.

551
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,620
I was looking at the currency.

552
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,860
I was looking at the fucking currency.

553
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,760
I was like, yay!

554
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,680
It's purple!

555
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,940
I didn't realize they're not the same purple.

556
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,380
God fucking, okay.

557
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,380
Not, guys, it was not the same purple, guys.

558
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:04,860
Okay.

559
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,460
I need 1500 damage on, on, on Storm.

560
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,160
And then, okay, that's two more.

561
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Okay, we got, that's two.

562
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,260
Okay.

563
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,860
No, it did not, see?

564
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,320
That's, this unlocked already.

565
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,580
So if I do this, I get these right away.

566
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,720
That's my oxygen deprived.

567
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,180
Oh shit, they were both purple!

568
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,580
I'm going with color!

569
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,320
I go with color, not shape.

570
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,700
Why didn't they change the orb to another color?

571
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,880
Okay, wait, but did I not defeat 25?

572
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,120
How do I defeat another 20?

573
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,400
Okay.

574
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,180
Well, we got this.

575
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,680
Oh, it just unlocked.

576
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:54,800
I literally unlocked the 15 kills as it unlocked the moment I played the second game.

577
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,560
Okay.

578
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:55,920
Okay.

579
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,580
We got this.

580
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,020
Okay, one more quick play.

581
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,000
One more quick play on Storm.

582
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,020
This is okay.

583
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,620
This time, this time we'll unlock it.

584
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,840
Where are the other ones?

585
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,200
Were the other ones any fun?

586
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,740
What the fuck?

587
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,740
Did we lose?

588
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,580
What happened?

589
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,540
Did I win?

590
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,540
Good game, guys.

591
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,740
I just got here!

592
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,860
What the fuck?

593
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,660
I'm not even part of the team?

594
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,020
I'm not even part of the- what?

595
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,540
I wasn't even there.

596
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,520
I didn't even get to be part of this team.

597
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,040
Like, I can't believe Zoe is here.

598
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,340
Bro thinks she's on the team.

599
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,000
Why put me there?

600
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,500
I can't even be part of the team.

601
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,040
I didn't even get a photo.

602
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,700
That's so fucked up.

603
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,080
Okay.

604
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,260
Okay, now.

605
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,740
Now it should be fine.

606
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,500
Can't believe I didn't even get a fucking photo.

607
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,040
Like, I was like, did I win?

608
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,240
Did I do it?

609
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,640
All right, here we go.

610
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,020
All right.

611
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,120
How do you stop sleep apnea?

612
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,440
Anyway.

613
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,960
Am I fucked?

614
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,120
Is this why I'm like this?

615
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,860
No, but like, I've been like this since birth.

616
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,260
So maybe my body has trained itself.

617
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,520
For the lack of oxygen.

618
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,780
You cannot?

619
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,100
So like...

620
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,060
Do I just stop?

621
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,400
Like, does my- can my brain adapt?

622
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:28,660
Can my brain adapt to it?

623
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,560
Like...

624
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,220
The doking just evolved.

625
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,100
Oh my god, maybe I used to be smarter.

626
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,700
Maybe I was so fucking smart that like...

627
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,240
It's like I used to be so smart.

628
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,400
That like the last- so I'm just losing.

629
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,080
I'm just becoming more and more like, you know.

630
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,340
Like I'm not that stupid, right?

631
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,260
I'm not.

632
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,440
I'm not.

633
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:07,120
Like I just, you know, I'm more stupid because I used to be so- like I used to be like a child prodigy or whatever.

634
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,600
And then it's just I'm becoming more.

635
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,660
I'm just becoming more average.

636
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,460
Is that it?

637
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,620
Yes, you are.

638
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,440
Like I just have so much brain cells to spare.

639
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,380
So it should be fine, right?

640
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,060
Right?

641
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,940
Is that stupid?

642
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,980
Is that stupid?

643
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,160
Is that stupid?

644
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:34,780
Like...

645
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,480
Checks out.

646
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,560
Got a hat to nerf doki.

647
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,320
All right, at least my aim is still there.

648
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,860
Like despite me losing brain cells, I can still aim, I think.

649
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,820
Yeah, I could have been like- I could have been the one that um...

650
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:07,780
I could have been the one that finds the cure for cancer, but instead I had to use that because I was- I got scared.

651
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,240
I got scared, but it's okay.

652
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,780
I get rezzed.

653
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,240
It's not okay because I don't know- oh, it is still okay.

654
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,400
Oh, fuck.

655
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,040
There you go.

656
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,800
Don't worry.

657
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,420
I'm a hero.

658
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,960
Don't worry.

659
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,780
I'm a hero.

660
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,780
I'm a fucking hero.

661
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,020
Do not worry.

662
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,620
I'm still a hero.

663
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,940
Where's the- oh, there you go.

664
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,080
That should be 20, right?

665
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,960
Oh shit, okay.

666
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,060
I'm not- I think I'm gonna die.

667
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,180
Don't worry, I did it.

668
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,500
I did my job.

669
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,740
Oh shit.

670
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,740
Oh, that was good.

671
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,560
That was actually good from the spider-man, but he's dead.

672
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,580
But that's okay.

673
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,420
Well, someone's got touch card, right?

674
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,900
Come on, invisible woman.

675
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,420
Touch card.

676
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,280
Don't be a pussy.

677
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:09,000
But yeah, I could have been the one that like finds the cure for cancer, but then I was born with sleep apnea.

678
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
So now I'm here become- so now I'm a vtuber.

679
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,660
Like, just- just life things.

680
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:19,980
Okay.

681
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,880
I mean, it could be.

682
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,760
You don't know that.

683
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,300
My potential is unlimited.

684
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,200
Okay, I used that instantly because I just didn't want to die.

685
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,860
And also, fuck that one guy in particular.

686
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,940
I'm gonna die, but like, I got my kill.

687
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,420
Oh, I'm not gonna die.

688
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,180
Nice.

689
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,580
Wait.

690
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,200
Oh, I didn't see this guy.

691
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,360
His existence means nothing to me.

692
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,780
Okay, nice.

693
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,120
Let me get on damage.

694
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,760
Not nice.

695
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,020
Not nice.

696
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,680
All right.

697
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,220
Yeah, I could have cured sleep apnea, but not for sleep apnea.

698
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,360
It's just life things.

699
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,740
Okay, do I have it?

700
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,740
Oh, I have it.

701
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,780
I hit my quota.

702
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,720
I should be able to afford twerking emote.

703
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:17,920
All right.

704
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,040
You probably make people beg for it.

705
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,740
I'll do that thing where- I'll do something worse.

706
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,740
I'll work for a pharmaceutical company.

707
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,060
No!

708
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,990
I'll just slowly walk away.

709
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,550
The fuck?

710
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,210
Oh, he killed somebody.

711
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,810
I was gonna be like, what's he gonna do?

712
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:48,870
Fucking float to me?

713
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,590
Okay, I got the thunder strike though.

714
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,770
Okay, I'm- can somebody heal me?

715
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,090
I got rid of my descend key for this.

716
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,790
Oh my god, I'll slowly walk up.

717
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:05,050
Oh.

718
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,430
Oh, he gets healed?

719
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,130
That's cheating!

720
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,790
If he's gonna get healed, I should get healed too.

721
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,390
Oh, I did.

722
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,790
Okay, it's not cheating anymore.

723
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,190
Where are they?

724
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,530
I like can't see shit right now.

725
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:20,350
Oh, fuck.

726
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,670
I thought I got away with it.

727
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,050
Just float away.

728
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,270
Big pharma strikes again.

729
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,450
No, I'd work not just any pharmaceutical company.

730
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,150
I'd work for an American pharmaceutical company.

731
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,930
I'll sell the cure to America.

732
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,230
God, no.

733
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,430
Thank god you guys got saved by my lack of brain cells.

734
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,970
By my brain being deprived of oxygen.

735
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:53,990
Thank fucking god.

736
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,310
No!

737
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,330
If we lose, then it's okay.

738
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,750
Okay, that- that was a choice.

739
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,890
That was a choice from my strain.

740
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,410
At this point, it'll go.

741
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:16,630
Oh, back home.

742
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,870
Then I'm gonna go back.

743
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,350
Woo!

744
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,890
Huge ult.

745
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:23,810
Whoa.

746
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,590
Hey, that's a good attempt though.

747
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,010
Good for you.

748
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:27,610
You tried.

749
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,250
Oh wait, he gets away?

750
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,810
He can do that?

751
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,530
Not for him though.

752
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:36,670
Oh shit.

753
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,650
Okay, they don't see me when I'm in the air this high up.

754
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,230
So I don't get aimed at.

755
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:41,950
What?

756
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:43,090
Oh.

757
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:44,030
Oh.

758
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,920
You try.

759
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,140
And that's all that matters.

760
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,020
You try.

761
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,460
You know what?

762
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,420
I'll use it here.

763
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,700
I know like, I know I should- oh wait, no.

764
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:01,680
I can use it.

765
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,860
Fuck this guy in particular.

766
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,360
You have no- god damn it.

767
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,440
How did he get healed?

768
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,360
It's not fair!

769
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,340
Get rezzed.

770
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,740
Nice.

771
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,420
I believe it.

772
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,740
How dare he use his teammates?

773
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,400
Not fair.

774
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,460
All right, that should be enough, right?

775
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,380
That should be enough for Venom.

776
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,160
Look at all this damage I'm farming!

777
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,200
Like, there's no way!

778
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,120
All I do is just shoot!

779
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,200
How does no one else have more than five kil- oh wait, no.

780
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,220
Our fucking support, at least they're doing something.

781
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,780
I'm surprised I have just as many kills.

782
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,540
I was like, how the fuck do I have the most kills?

783
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,640
How the fuck does our sup- oh fuck, I need- I need to look down.

784
00:46:59,240 --> 00:46:59,760
Okay.

785
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,820
Oh my god, you fucking whore.

786
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,860
All you have to do is left click.

787
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,260
There's a reason why everybody avoids you in Blink.

788
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:15,800
Okay.

789
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,620
It's fine.

790
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:18,800
We're fine.

791
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,740
Everything is fine.

792
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,740
My fucking Sue has more kills than me.

793
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,240
And it's- I'm sad.

794
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,460
I thought I was so safe.

795
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,860
I thought I was so safe.

796
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,060
Okay, she's gonna be extra fucked when I actually play- if I play Hela, she's fucked.

797
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,360
I'll play Hela after this.

798
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,340
Dang.

799
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,840
Oh, you're stupid.

800
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,120
Oh, no, it's fine.

801
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,520
Can't believe it.

802
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,180
How can my support do that?

803
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,740
Oh, wait, wait, that's huge!

804
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,540
Oh my god, god damn it.

805
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,680
I should have chose something that was easier to kill.

806
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,900
I did not see the rocket at all.

807
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,720
No, I can't change as Hela.

808
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,480
I can't change- wait for me again!

809
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,840
Yes, okay.

810
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,900
Okay, not okay.

811
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,180
Not okay.

812
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,000
I'm okay.

813
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,020
Idiot.

814
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,300
This is real firepower!

815
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,320
Actual stupid.

816
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,480
Stupid.

817
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,200
That's right.

818
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,460
With the power of electricity, I shall kill this tree.

819
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,420
If I can see him.

820
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,400
That's good.

821
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,960
Okay, I can finally swap Hela.

822
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,820
Now I'm mad.

823
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,960
Now I'm fucking mad.

824
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,420
Watch as I miss every shot.

825
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,860
Okay.

826
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,740
No more, Mr. Nice Guy.

827
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,600
Now I'm mad.

828
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,720
Where's this Scarlet?

829
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,440
So bad.

830
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,960
Fuck you guys.

831
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,220
Fucking right- oh, now you guys can't do anything!

832
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:33,820
Whoa!

833
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,580
Wow!

834
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,780
Like I can't aim!

835
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,240
That's so cute, right?

836
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,060
Pissed me off too hard.

837
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,380
Don't make me mad.

838
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,320
I'll swap to Hela.

839
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,940
Quantum, thank you for the- give the tier one sub.

840
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,400
Thank you.

841
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,180
Thank you.

842
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,500
Armory, thank you for a thousand bitties.

843
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:04,980
Thank you.

844
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:05,620
Thank you.

845
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,240
I know you don't usually stream on Twitch only on YouTube.

846
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,940
Do you have any plan to update the Twitch badges of the- No, I like my Twitch badges.

847
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,100
You know what they are?

848
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:26,600
It's me drawing it- Redrawing the default Twitch badges on MS Paint and then snipping it, screenshotting it, and then snipping it on with my uh, snip tool and then uploading it.

849
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,100
So some of them you can actually see my cursor.

850
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:39,080
Uh- You can actually see my cursor on the sub badges and they're like the OG Twitch badges, so I'm never gonna change it.

851
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,860
I drew them!

852
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,340
Do you not like it?

853
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,420
I drew them!

854
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,460
It's my beautiful art.

855
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,040
Oh my god, two rolls.

856
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,120
I can't believe it.

857
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,180
I need one more.

858
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,580
I actually need one more!

859
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,120
I have- Okay, that's fine.

860
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,660
That's fine.

861
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,400
That's fine, that's fine, that's totally fine.

862
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,940
Namus, thank you for the gift itself!

863
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,200
Thank you, thank you!

864
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,960
Please, I'm supposed to play ranked.

865
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:09,640
Guys, okay.

866
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,620
I just need one more and then we're done with quick play.

867
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,940
Okay, what do we need?

868
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,520
What do we need left?

869
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,360
Okay.

870
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:21,900
We need...

871
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,260
Okay, we need...

872
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,720
Oh my god, we were actually 10,000 damage away.

873
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,600
Okay, I can just play Hella.

874
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,400
I can just- Just play.

875
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,940
I can farm that on Hella so fast.

876
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:33,740
All right.

877
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,160
That's fine.

878
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,520
Just one more, guys.

879
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,360
Just one more and then we're free.

880
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,860
That's all we need.

881
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,950
Uh, Silver, thank you for the 100 bitties!

882
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,170
Thank you, thank you!

883
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:52,670
All right, it's Hella time.

884
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,330
I'm just gonna ruin their quick play game.

885
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,950
Give me a sec.

886
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,830
I'm just gonna ruin this for them.

887
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,770
Anyone that plays Hella in quick play is not here to have fun.

888
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:06,790
They're just here to fucking feel good.

889
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:17,790
They just- they can't feel good in ranked so they feel good in quick play.

890
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,840
Anyone that plays Hella doesn't have fun.

891
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,080
Oh, yeah.

892
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,320
I'm- guys, I'm doing this for the Venom twerk emote, guys.

893
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,500
It's all- look, it's not- it's not you.

894
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,200
It's Venom.

895
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,920
I'm trying to remember where people go from watching the streams.

896
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,300
I don't know where people fucking position themselves.

897
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,220
For this.

898
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:57,580
I don't- I like- DPS players are playing an entire other game compared to supports and tanks.

899
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,560
They are like- I- whenever I see like DPS streams, they're like in the whole world.

900
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,300
They like flank.

901
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:09,860
They actually know what's breakable and like where to- like where they're going and everything and I'm like, where are they?

902
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,300
I've never seen this part of the town before.

903
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:18,620
Like, oh my god, that is a new area that I've never seen.

904
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,820
I get so- Please, I'm just Hella.

905
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,360
Hahaha.

906
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,700
Oh, what the fuck?

907
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,600
They just let them do that to me?

908
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,680
They just let them do that?

909
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,560
No, I know they show but like I don't have to care about it as a support player.

910
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,840
Oh my god, sorry.

911
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,900
I looked up accidentally.

912
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,600
I don't have to care about it as a support player.

913
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:56,240
Because I'm just mostly- I'm not flanking or anything unless I'm playing- like most supports don't need to flank.

914
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,180
Like, where is it breakable?

915
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,600
It's been so long since I've broken stuff that I- oh, that's not what I wanted, but that's fine.

916
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,440
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

917
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,100
Oh no!

918
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:11,960
Oh!

919
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,640
Please!

920
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,560
Please!

921
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,180
He's just slowly punching towards me.

922
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,140
Somebody stop him!

923
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,240
Oh my god, somebody stop him.

924
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,080
He's just slowly walking towards me.

925
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,320
Oh my god.

926
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,200
Oh wait, they're still fighting.

927
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,860
Okay, I was- okay, never mind.

928
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,140
I was not planning on coming back.

929
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,820
I just need a damage burn.

930
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,040
That's all I need.

931
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,980
Oh my god, where do people fucking position themselves here?

932
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,180
I hate Iron Fist so much.

933
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:56,980
Goodbye.

934
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,720
If he doesn't see me, he won't kill me.

935
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,620
That's my plan.

936
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,640
Oh my god.

937
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,000
Oh, hey guys.

938
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:08,320
Hello.

939
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,220
Whoa, hello.

940
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,460
Saw the spider man, I was like, please.

941
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,740
Oh, fuck off.

942
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,220
You're trash.

943
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,520
I can farm this though.

944
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,600
Oh, I can still farm this.

945
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,700
It's okay.

946
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:35,440
I'll wait until the cloak ult is done and then let's go.

947
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,220
Yum, yummy.

948
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,780
Oh, my ult is useless.

949
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:48,100
Yes, I have- Yes, my ult is useless.

950
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,520
It's okay.

951
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,300
Where is he?

952
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,480
Oh my god.

953
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:58,040
Did I just even kill the team he gobbled up?

954
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,380
Oh my god, he could have actually just threw it in my- in my face and then I could have killed him.

955
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,400
Oh my god, why did you not kill them?

956
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,720
What was the point, Jeff?

957
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,160
Oh my god.

958
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,400
It's okay, he's still dead.

959
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,680
It's fine, I did my job.

960
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,780
Wait, does Jeff have zero kills?

961
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,360
How do you have zero kills as Jeff?

962
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,580
It's okay, he's just a little special.

963
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,240
Thank you, my little farmer.

964
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,520
Groot, please farm for me more.

965
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,080
Here you go.

966
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,360
I take this.

967
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,880
Oh, he's coming over.

968
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,080
Please kill the Punisher, not me.

969
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,660
Okay.

970
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,020
Okay, I don't want to be there.

971
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:57,740
That's fine.

972
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,420
Oh, that's not fine.

973
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,140
Oh, that's not fine.

974
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,120
It's all right, I'm doing my job.

975
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:07,880
Okay.

976
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,220
Okay, I believe on my team.

977
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,140
I believe in my zero kill Jeff.

978
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,540
He's gonna make it, guys.

979
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,280
He's learning.

980
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,940
That's what quick play is for.

981
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,560
And I'm just here to farm.

982
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,620
Oh, he didn't hit that?

983
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,120
God, I don't understand sometimes.

984
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,760
Why did I not hit that?

985
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,400
Oh, what is the fucking range for that?

986
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,700
Okay, that's fine.

987
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,780
My team is healing me.

988
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,380
You know what?

989
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,160
Fuck these guys.

990
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,880
All right.

991
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,200
Okay, never mind.

992
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,100
Okay, I guess... I guess they all just... yeah, that's fine.

993
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,180
That's fine.

994
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,560
That is not fine.

995
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,280
That is not fine!

996
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,580
Okay.

997
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,440
The door, um, closed.

998
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,200
Uh...

999
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,360
The door closed.

1000
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,020
It ended up not being fine.

1001
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,080
Why is it there?

1002
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,220
Guys...

1003
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,900
I do not control the door, unfortunately.

1004
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,300
It was not fine in the end.

1005
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,080
It's okay.

1006
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,440
We can hold four minutes or we just...

1007
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,000
It would be so funny if, um, I just stopped shooting here.

1008
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,000
Because I got my points.

1009
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,720
I hate this map the most because of this.

1010
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,020
This, when it changes, is so annoying.

1011
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,020
That Spider-Man has all...

1012
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,500
Whoop.

1013
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,400
Bye, Spider-Man.

1014
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,100
See, look.

1015
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,020
Oh, I hate that.

1016
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:39,760
I hate this.

1017
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,560
I hate this.

1018
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,840
Where am I?

1019
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,040
Where the fuck am I?

1020
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,260
I don't know where I am.

1021
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,080
Whenever that happens, I just lose track of everything.

1022
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,860
Oh, I... Wait, she lives?

1023
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,260
God damn it.

1024
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,000
I don't want a front line.

1025
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,320
I'm just a hella... like, I... my body is so weak.

1026
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,140
I don't want to front line this.

1027
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,280
I have such a weak body.

1028
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,440
Oh, hey, Invisible Woman.

1029
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,120
Hey, you just want to watch?

1030
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,780
That's fine.

1031
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,400
I...

1032
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,080
You're still watching?

1033
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,560
You didn't even get a kill out of that.

1034
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,860
How do you...

1035
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,720
How do you still...

1036
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,540
How do you still... Oh, wait, at least I finally got a kill.

1037
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,820
I'm proud of you.

1038
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,720
I... I'm proud...

1039
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,960
She could have literally helped.

1040
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,260
She did not have to stay invisible.

1041
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,000
She just stood there.

1042
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,820
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1043
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,980
Holy shit.

1044
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,960
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1045
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,620
You're still...

1046
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,280
Oh my god.

1047
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,620
It didn't even work the first time.

1048
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,840
It's not gonna work again.

1049
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,320
Oh my god.

1050
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,420
It still didn't work.

1051
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,240
It still didn't work.

1052
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,680
Oh my god.

1053
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,100
This fucker saves it just for me.

1054
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,000
I...

1055
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,340
Cause I'm the only one with an ult that actually means anything to my team.

1056
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,500
Okay.

1057
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,420
Oh my god!

1058
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,000
What the f...

1059
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,620
There we go.

1060
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,440
How did he still follow me?

1061
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,460
Your team...

1062
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,740
The team's only tank.

1063
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:46,680
Why?

1064
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,460
Why are you still following me?

1065
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,020
Tank for your team!

1066
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,020
Jesus.

1067
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,820
He wanted to kill me obviously.

1068
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,220
How are you still there?

1069
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:03,760
Is he gonna...

1070
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,400
Is that breakable?

1071
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,820
It's gonna fucking bash into that wall?

1072
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,840
Like next to me?

1073
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:09,880
Okay.

1074
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:14,860
Yoink.

1075
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,120
Stealing that kill.

1076
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,600
Oh, I had to reload.

1077
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,260
If I didn't have to reload, I might've been...

1078
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,840
I hate aiming down though.

1079
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,360
I'm so bad at aiming down.

1080
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,680
Okay, that's embarrassing.

1081
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:31,480
For you.

1082
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,700
Oh my god, please.

1083
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:40,480
What?

1084
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,280
I'm sorry I can't aim anyway!

1085
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,040
It's so hard to aim after that.

1086
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,580
Oh my god, I can't.

1087
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,760
I got so...

1088
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,860
I got confused.

1089
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,500
Like, what?

1090
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,640
I died meditating.

1091
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,440
I couldn't aim.

1092
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,300
I was like, so confused.

1093
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,180
I was like, why?

1094
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,080
Thank you.

1095
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:22,660
Why?

1096
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,700
Thank you.

1097
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,200
I'm so confused.

1098
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,660
Oh yeah, by the way, I'm trying raw input for the first time.

1099
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,200
I don't know if it's gonna help.

1100
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,500
So like, I feel...

1101
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,020
I don't know.

1102
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,740
I've never used raw input before.

1103
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,520
Apparently it's slower?

1104
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,640
From what I've heard?

1105
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:47,160
Okay.

1106
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,500
Yeah, I got this out.

1107
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,700
Alright, watch the cloak ult.

1108
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,660
I die right out too because I have no HP.

1109
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,280
There we go.

1110
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,700
This guy literally does not use cloak ult until I...

1111
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,580
I'm dead here.

1112
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:01,900
Until I appear.

1113
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,400
What's raw input?

1114
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,000
Raw input, it uses your exact movement on your mouse.

1115
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,980
But I've never done it before.

1116
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,040
I've never used raw input before.

1117
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,480
It's actually my first time.

1118
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,420
Like, today.

1119
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,600
I don't know if it's actually good or not for me.

1120
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,740
I have no idea.

1121
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,000
That's not fair.

1122
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,120
Wait, they're healing each other.

1123
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,880
Wait, that's not fair.

1124
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:31,980
They're actually healing.

1125
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,360
I did so much.

1126
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,660
I did so much, but that's okay.

1127
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,520
Hey, that's illegal.

1128
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,900
Apparently, it makes it so your mouse movement is a bit slower with raw input.

1129
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,100
But yeah, it bypasses...

1130
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:50,740
Yeah, that's right.

1131
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,420
The bypasses the software that controls the mouse.

1132
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,100
Thank god, I'm so tired of LOS.

1133
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,340
Was I doing that much?

1134
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,260
Oh, I dealt the most damage in game.

1135
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,440
I was like, was I actually doing anything?

1136
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,260
I was just fucking around.

1137
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:16,500
Okay.

1138
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:18,400
Let's see.

1139
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:18,820
Yay!

1140
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:23,240
Finally, I get to move my one square.

1141
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:25,960
Let's go.

1142
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,800
When do I claim it?

1143
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,780
When do I get it?

1144
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,000
Oh, when does it show up?

1145
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,860
Does it show up on April Fool's?

1146
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,760
Oh, tomorrow?

1147
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,480
Oh, in 14 hours.

1148
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:38,920
Nice.

1149
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,160
Oh, is it this?

1150
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,360
Oh my god, it's this.

1151
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,260
Okay, I did it.

1152
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,840
Alright, now we get to play a one-rank game.

1153
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:46,720
Now...

1154
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:48,920
Alright.

1155
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,120
If we lose on the main, I'm swapping accounts.

1156
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,820
I'm moving accounts.

1157
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:58,500
Yeah.

1158
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,080
I gave myself...

1159
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,720
Oh my god.

1160
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,340
I worked so hard getting that turkey emote.

1161
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,060
Let me reward myself by playing rank.

1162
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,880
The biggest reward of the night.

1163
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,620
Nerdy, thank you for the 100 bitties.

1164
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,820
Thank you, thank you.

1165
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,660
Hey Doki, long time follower.

1166
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,300
I remember your Overwatch and emo streams.

1167
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,040
I currently see how far you're coming in your journey.

1168
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:25,520
I hope you can continue to have fun and streaming for many more seasons to come.

1169
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,580
Thank you, Dyno.

1170
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,500
Oh my god.

1171
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,540
That's an OG OG Bark night right there.

1172
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,480
Thank you so much.

1173
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,380
I can't believe you're supporting me even now.

1174
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,420
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

1175
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,900
Alright, let's see.

1176
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,200
Did we just practice in Doom?

1177
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:45,740
I forgot, like, at these hours the queue times...

1178
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,000
I don't even know if anybody...

1179
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,980
Who's like...

1180
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,740
Who's even on right now?

1181
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:51,940
Like...

1182
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,520
Like...

1183
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,920
Oh, the usual ELO terrorists they're on.

1184
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,280
Okay.

1185
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,040
And the actual players.

1186
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:04,320
There's not a lot of actual players on at this time, unfortunately.

1187
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,000
Yeah, I rewarded myself by playing Psylocke.

1188
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,980
Yeah, I get it on April Fool's.

1189
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,440
I don't know.

1190
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,420
I think tomorrow I might just...

1191
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:18,360
Depending on how much...

1192
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:22,700
How many hours I stream today Get over here.

1193
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,080
Wait, what?

1194
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:33,320
Okay.

1195
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:34,900
I was like...

1196
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,360
Wait, there's two of you?

1197
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:45,720
I was like, wait, there's two of you?

1198
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:47,920
Oh.

1199
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,040
Oh my god, he's RPing NPC.

1200
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,300
Oh, whoops, sorry.

1201
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,560
I forgot about my right click.

1202
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:53,180
I...

1203
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,260
I forgot I gave you my right click there.

1204
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,980
Oh my god, it's an actual NPC.

1205
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,460
LRP.

1206
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,260
It was an accident!

1207
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,420
I forgot my right click was in his body!

1208
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,540
I literally looked away and then he just died.

1209
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,020
What I was saying before...

1210
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:15,760
Oh, I'm in game.

1211
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,740
What was I saying before I accidentally killed him?

1212
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,700
I was just trying to warm up!

1213
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,620
I don't know what the ELO is for this.

1214
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:41,620
Oh yeah, depending on how long I stream today and see if I want to finish my quota tomorrow.

1215
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:47,920
Jesus Christ, how do we Oh, this is gonna be a fast one game on the main I guess.

1216
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,700
I'm not hopeful anymore.

1217
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,360
Oh boy.

1218
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,880
The ELO terrorists are out today.

1219
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,880
It is 2.30 in the morning.

1220
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:09,450
I'm on central coast right now too.

1221
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:12,290
I think that's central.

1222
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,050
Why did we ban?

1223
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,410
Ban Groot!

1224
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,210
Please!

1225
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,890
Wait, did somebody ban?

1226
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:26,010
Please, I do not want to play against Groot.

1227
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,770
Did this guy ban Iron Fist?

1228
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:34,790
Did this guy actually ban Iron Fist?

1229
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:36,850
What the fuck is wrong with my team?

1230
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:37,430
What?

1231
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:38,950
Oh, the enemy did.

1232
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:39,290
Okay.

1233
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:43,550
It's always someone who doesn't hide a name.

1234
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:44,490
Oh!

1235
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:45,970
I was like, what?

1236
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,070
Oh no, yeah, the enemy.

1237
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,750
Okay, this is looking great, guys.

1238
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:50,570
Oh!

1239
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:52,870
Oh!

1240
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,230
Are people really trying that hard?

1241
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:57,010
What?

1242
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:02,870
They look up the names of like the people on our team to see what they play.

1243
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:04,310
That is so cringe.

1244
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:07,630
That's actually so fucking cringe.

1245
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:11,770
They actually look up the names.

1246
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:20,490
Yeah, there's apparently if not everybody doesn't use streamer mode.

1247
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:24,790
What's the point of having competitive mode on?

1248
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,910
I would if everyone wasn't.

1249
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,010
It's alright, guys.

1250
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:31,810
I can do this on my own.

1251
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,350
That's so dumb.

1252
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:44,170
Like, what's the point of having competitive mode if it takes just one person not being in competitive mode for it?

1253
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:45,690
I don't know.

1254
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,630
There's three fuck- there's two flankers and one guy that flies.

1255
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,810
I don't know who the fuck to put my orb on.

1256
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:57,190
I don't know who to put my orb on for this.

1257
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:00,190
Guess I should have picked Spiderman who's there first.

1258
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:03,790
I'll put it on Spiderman.

1259
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:06,610
Oh my god.

1260
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,650
I should have warmed up on Luna.

1261
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:15,290
I 100% should have warmed up on Luna.

1262
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:18,170
Oh my god.

1263
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,030
My- I forgot how fast-paced.

1264
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:32,470
Like, after playing, uh, Hella and, uh- Oh my god, it's so fast-paced playing as Luna compared to- compared to this.

1265
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,930
I forgot what that's like.

1266
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:42,930
Oh my god, my eyes are like not ready.

1267
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:55,230
My eyes- no, because I was playing playing Hella and Storm is a lot slower paced than playing Luna because I don't have to be aware as aware but I have to be so aware when I'm on Luna.

1268
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:00,450
Somebody save Greg!

1269
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,250
I mean, I don't play Hulk and I'm not hopping on it.

1270
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:03,810
I'm sorry, man.

1271
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:04,750
Greg!

1272
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:07,610
Don't worry, Greg!

1273
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:08,510
No!

1274
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:11,270
Okay.

1275
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:14,210
Alright, everything is fine.

1276
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:17,190
I need to reload.

1277
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:17,510
Oh!

1278
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:19,850
That froze somebody.

1279
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,410
I- where am I?

1280
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:22,650
Oh!

1281
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,610
There's a Namor right behind me!

1282
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:28,750
Guys, I don't think this game's gonna go well.

1283
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:33,650
I don't believe- I wanna believe but it's hard to believe right now.

1284
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:41,130
You- okay you- okay, I'll speak.

1285
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:43,670
I don't know.

1286
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:45,910
I don't even wanna speak if this game isn't winnable.

1287
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:55,670
I don't know if I wanna speak and let them know I exist.

1288
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,290
It is.

1289
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:07,790
But it's eternity at 2 in the morning or 4 in the morning for- I don't think I can.

1290
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:09,750
Okay.

1291
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,010
Oh, goodbye, Greg.

1292
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:13,810
Hello, Greg.

1293
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:17,130
I don't believe in us, Greg.

1294
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:25,130
Greg, I don't know if I- if enough- if enough freezes will save us, Greg.

1295
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:26,750
Okay.

1296
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:30,630
Let's go.

1297
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,270
I'm going forward.

1298
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,330
Whoa!

1299
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,710
Don't worry, I'll die here for us.

1300
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,080
Alright.

1301
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:44,660
Yeah.

1302
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,280
This ain't looking so hot.

1303
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:48,800
Greg!

1304
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:55,400
I don't even know who JellyPeanut is but look at my team.

1305
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:58,540
Look at-

1306
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,380
Look at my team.

1307
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:16,040
It was- It was done by HeroSelect.

1308
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,860
We were fucked over by HeroSelect.

1309
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:30,160
We literally started off with Iron Fi- We started off with Storm, Spider, and Black Panther with a solo tank hulk.

1310
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,500
So...

1311
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:36,960
Yeah.

1312
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,180
Yeah.

1313
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,360
Whoa!

1314
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:48,760
Whoa!

1315
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:54,440
Uh...

1316
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:57,980
Uh...

1317
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:03,560
No, he was gonna switch to invis but you took shrine so I couldn't swap off of it.

1318
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:05,660
Um...

1319
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:09,520
Yeah!

1320
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:12,920
This...

1321
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,340
This team is going great, guys.

1322
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,120
There you go.

1323
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,660
I don't know, I freeze him every time.

1324
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,420
I don't know what more I can do.

1325
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,260
Oh hey!

1326
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,160
Hey guys!

1327
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:28,820
Wait!

1328
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,640
Maybe you can- There is hope in this dark world!

1329
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,020
Oh my god!

1330
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:35,400
Wait!

1331
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,980
No, I shouldn't start hoping.

1332
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,420
Then my hopes will be crushed.

1333
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:39,560
I shouldn't.

1334
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,200
Maybe like...

1335
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,660
You know, it's just a false sense of security.

1336
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,280
You know, maybe it's just bait, guys.

1337
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:47,980
Guys...

1338
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,380
Just be bait.

1339
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:55,360
We can't- We can't think that there is real joy in this world.

1340
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,160
There's no such- That's impossible.

1341
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:02,420
I stopped feeling joy since I started playing competitive.

1342
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,040
What the fuck is he- Okay.

1343
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:15,060
I was like- I was like, what is that spider-man doing just waiting?

1344
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:15,280
Wait.

1345
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,300
I'm sorry!

1346
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:22,640
I'm so sorry!

1347
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,100
I'm so sorry!

1348
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,420
Whoa!

1349
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,660
I'm ready to put on a show!

1350
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,260
Hey, that's good.

1351
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,700
I didn't use that for nothing.

1352
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,320
I did that to save my own life.

1353
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:36,560
But like, that's good.

1354
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,400
That's great.

1355
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:40,620
Okay.

1356
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:41,720
That's fine.

1357
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,400
I have this.

1358
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:43,860
That's fine.

1359
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,060
I still have this.

1360
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,040
And then my invis woman has ult, right?

1361
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,180
Yeah, there we go.

1362
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,500
See, guys?

1363
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:59,600
My ult- Actually, it wasn't- My ult baited out the Luna ult, so like, it was great in the end.

1364
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,200
It was planned.

1365
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:02,820
I was the ult baiter.

1366
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,520
That was my entire intention.

1367
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:08,060
How?

1368
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:11,620
What is this shit?

1369
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,800
Our spider-man was like, I give up.

1370
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,340
How did he crash out?

1371
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,080
He dies and then he's like, fuck this.

1372
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,100
Please.

1373
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:24,620
Please.

1374
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:25,860
Please!

1375
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,780
How could you do this?

1376
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,960
I freeze him every time!

1377
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,420
I don't understand!

1378
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:42,440
I freeze him every time and you still let me die?

1379
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,300
What's the point?

1380
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,740
What's the point of doing my job?

1381
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:52,880
Okay.

1382
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,540
Oh, wait.

1383
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:56,260
Portal time.

1384
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:58,780
Okay.

1385
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,620
But I'm the spider-man.

1386
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:02,920
Go, Greg!

1387
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,360
Okay, this is my first miss, guys.

1388
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,160
Like, it's literally my first time I missed.

1389
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:18,740
Running spider-man to Namor is actually like, masochist right there.

1390
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:19,700
Okay, cool.

1391
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,680
Why did no one come in there with me and Greg?

1392
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,480
Does no one like us?

1393
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,280
Does no one like me and Greg?

1394
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,080
But then me and Greg...

1395
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,240
Ew!

1396
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:38,500
I went in the portal with Greg!

1397
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,840
I believed in him!

1398
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,260
Oh, no.

1399
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,220
He was so fast.

1400
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,240
I couldn't get to him.

1401
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,440
I couldn't put my orb on him.

1402
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,680
I swear to god.

1403
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,560
He like, runs away now.

1404
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,640
He's so scared.

1405
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,440
Why?

1406
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:57,600
Greg!

1407
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:58,640
Why, Greg?

1408
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:00,800
Why?

1409
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,200
Greg!

1410
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:12,420
Greg!

1411
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:14,860
Why, Greg?

1412
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,620
Why did he ult out of nowhere?

1413
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,280
Guys, see?

1414
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:25,360
This is why I stopped being...

1415
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,900
I stopped believing it these days.

1416
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,820
Never trust anyone.

1417
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,480
Not even your team.

1418
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,960
I didn't ult that because I felt we have one more contest.

1419
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,020
Oh, okay.

1420
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:41,880
That's fine.

1421
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,560
We just...

1422
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,660
That's fine.

1423
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,220
That's totally fine.

1424
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,080
That's fine.

1425
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,300
I thought I was gonna ult first.

1426
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,340
Okay, wait.

1427
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,060
Do we have strange?

1428
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,720
I'm gonna do a gamer move.

1429
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:00,940
Wait, actually, I don't.

1430
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,540
That's so sad.

1431
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,020
We double support ulted.

1432
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,060
I ulted first, too.

1433
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,400
I ulted first, too.

1434
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:23,720
I did not hear that he was gonna ult.

1435
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,140
Wow!

1436
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:24,200
Wow!

1437
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:34,580
I did not hear the comm that he was gonna ult first.

1438
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:35,800
I'm gonna say.

1439
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,380
I don't know.

1440
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,680
Maybe I didn't hear it, but I definitely...

1441
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,600
He was not loud.

1442
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,700
I did not hear that he was gonna ult first.

1443
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,940
I heard zero comms from that guy.

1444
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,980
It was no way.

1445
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,120
Nah, he didn't say shit.

1446
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:56,940
Alright, guys.

1447
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:57,540
Give me a sec.

1448
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:58,480
We're swapping accounts.

1449
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,680
I know what the games are like at these hours.

1450
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,200
We all know what that means.

1451
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,220
Give me a sec.

1452
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,280
It's account swap.

1453
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,620
I'm gonna disappear, too, because since I have to swap Steam accounts.

1454
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,840
No one commed anything.

1455
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,880
I was like, what do you mean?

1456
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:17,500
Whoa!

1457
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,760
Alright, let me swap real quick, guys.

1458
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,160
Oh, I need to close all my other stuff now, too.

1459
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:29,360
Yeah, I was like, I'm pretty sure if I heard it, I would have not.

1460
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,780
Also, the fact that he watched me die.

1461
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:40,940
He was comming with his... No one said anything.

1462
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:45,980
I just remember someone yelling at our hulk because that's all I heard.

1463
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:53,860
Everyone was... That's the only thing that I heard from the comm before that was being like, what the fuck is our hulk doing?

1464
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,940
What the fuck is our strange doing?

1465
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,740
Why are we split up?

1466
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,020
That was the only comm I heard throughout that entire game.

1467
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:05,020
I have no idea what else they were listening to.

1468
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:06,460
Alright.

1469
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,040
Let's see.

1470
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,120
I'll do that.

1471
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,980
And then...

1472
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:16,600
Yeah, I just... It was literally GG from character select.

1473
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,280
People just hated each other.

1474
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:23,060
The moment we went in, there was like nothing to save my team at that point.

1475
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,560
It was just hopeless.

1476
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:31,460
If you're GG from character select, then like, I don't know what to tell you.

1477
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah, it was already game over by lobby.

1478
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,560
Let's see.

1479
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:44,500
Okay.

1480
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,600
Ult account time.

1481
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:47,840
I'm back.

1482
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:51,140
Alright, I'm the ult now.

1483
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:59,900
Yeah, I just tried one game just to see how it goes and I was like, alright, that's one game enough.

1484
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,060
That's enough.

1485
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:07,080
We either lose eternity or maybe we'll get lucky.

1486
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:07,960
I don't know.

1487
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,580
But welcome to my other account, DonKingKong.

1488
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:15,700
My...

1489
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,220
We have...

1490
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:20,260
Yeah, my ult account.

1491
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:23,300
That's DonKingKong, the legend.

1492
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,940
But yeah, we'll see how it goes.

1493
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:27,800
Maybe it'll be better.

1494
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:28,500
I don't know.

1495
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:29,360
That's crazy.

1496
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,940
I hit all... like I hit...

1497
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:35,000
I think I hit like every freeze but one freeze on the venom.

1498
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,120
And then I got blamed.

1499
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:43,880
And then he called He called me a slur and then...

1500
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:45,780
That's all it takes.

1501
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,360
One mistake and then you get called a slur.

1502
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,100
That's crazy.

1503
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,740
That sounds like my competitive games right there.

1504
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:05,220
Oh, this is an old crosshair.

1505
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,340
Oh, I don't like it.

1506
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:07,220
Fuck.

1507
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,780
Okay, I don't like this crosshair.

1508
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:09,760
Oh my gosh.

1509
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,020
I don't remember what my other crosshair is though.

1510
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:14,900
Oh, I don't like this crosshair.

1511
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:15,460
It's too tiny.

1512
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:16,220
Fuck.

1513
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:16,520
Okay.

1514
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:17,900
I'll hide.

1515
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:21,970
Yes, I don't hide.

1516
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:26,590
Wait, this is where health packs are.

1517
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:27,270
Okay.

1518
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:29,070
I hide.

1519
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:30,670
Okay, let me...

1520
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,710
Let me look at my...

1521
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:34,870
Does he know?

1522
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:37,730
Okay.

1523
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:40,790
This is an old crosshair of mine.

1524
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:41,590
I need to change it.

1525
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:42,210
I don't like that.

1526
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:42,790
This one.

1527
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:46,570
It's too hard to see.

1528
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:48,010
I don't know what...

1529
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:49,690
I'm too lazy to swap too.

1530
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:51,150
See details.

1531
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:52,290
Fuck.

1532
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:52,690
Okay.

1533
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:56,610
Gamers don't look up.

1534
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:57,430
They never do.

1535
01:23:59,270 --> 01:23:59,790
Okay.

1536
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,790
I haven't played in these lower lobbies in a long time.

1537
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:04,770
We'll see how it goes.

1538
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:13,430
Oh my god, since I'm in lower lobbies I feel a little excited.

1539
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:14,810
Exciting today.

1540
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,810
Maybe I'll play Adam.

1541
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:17,930
I feel a little quirky.

1542
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:19,770
Maybe I'll play Adam.

1543
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:21,810
I have nothing to lose.

1544
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:27,210
I'm more afraid of lower lobbies because they're angrier people.

1545
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:32,570
Lower lobbies?

1546
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:35,990
They are a lot angrier as people compared to higher elo.

1547
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:38,290
So that's why I'm a little afraid.

1548
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:43,370
Especially if they're like...

1549
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:43,950
Oh shit.

1550
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:44,290
Okay.

1551
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:57,190
Especially if they're like on the verge of eternity because a lot of them flip-flop between eternity and celestial so they're very, very angry people because they can't get above low eternity.

1552
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:00,670
They're always trapped between celestial 1 and eternity.

1553
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:02,450
So they care more.

1554
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:05,050
Nice!

1555
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:05,390
Yay!

1556
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:06,590
I got my bands!

1557
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:08,450
I can't run Adam.

1558
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:09,630
We don't do triple support.

1559
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,410
So maybe they'll wanna go triple support.

1560
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:17,410
Let me fix my crosshair.

1561
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:20,230
I don't remember.

1562
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:20,850
That's the thing.

1563
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:23,270
I don't know how to do my crosshair.

1564
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:25,390
So we're just gonna wing it.

1565
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:27,210
I just think it's too small.

1566
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:29,730
Crosshair opacity...

1567
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,830
Oh no, I don't want that to disappear.

1568
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,950
Outline detail...

1569
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:36,180
Maybe...

1570
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:40,250
Stronger outline...

1571
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:41,630
That...

1572
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:43,630
And then...

1573
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:45,970
No, I need the dot here.

1574
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:49,650
Uh... Oh wait.

1575
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:53,710
That...

1576
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:57,370
And then... I don't like the reticle thingy.

1577
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:59,710
The circle thingy there.

1578
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:03,440
Yeah.

1579
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,580
That...

1580
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,700
Center gap...

1581
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,600
Whoa!

1582
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,760
No, that's fine.

1583
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,260
Maybe like this.

1584
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,100
I'll try this and see how I feel.

1585
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,000
Alright, nice.

1586
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,580
Triple support, let's go!

1587
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:20,780
I don't know.

1588
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,020
It's a little big.

1589
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,840
Fuck, okay, this is a...

1590
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,360
I don't know.

1591
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,280
I might just use a dot.

1592
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:32,060
I don't like this.

1593
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,140
Okay, it's a little too big, yeah.

1594
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,380
We'll see how this goes.

1595
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,500
I do not like this crosshair.

1596
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:39,840
At all.

1597
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:44,960
I don't know.

1598
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,360
I'll just go by...

1599
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,340
I'll just go by, like, feel.

1600
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,280
Alright, let's go!

1601
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:51,880
Let's advance!

1602
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,700
I did it after him.

1603
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,860
So, like, we'll have this longer.

1604
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,200
That's right.

1605
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,540
Whoa, I'm so smart!

1606
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:03,300
I did it after!

1607
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,580
Wait, why did we let that tap, guys?

1608
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:07,860
Why?

1609
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,400
It's fine.

1610
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:11,660
I rez.

1611
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,800
I don't know why we did it after, but that's okay.

1612
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,900
Oh, what the fuck?

1613
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,720
We got it already?

1614
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:21,300
Nice.

1615
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,080
I definitely want to change my crosshair.

1616
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,700
I'm not happy with it.

1617
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,460
I can't aim right now with this one.

1618
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:31,000
Oh, I cannot aim with this crosshair.

1619
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,040
Oh, I need to die!

1620
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:34,400
I'm gonna do a dot then.

1621
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:37,080
This one's way too hard to aim with.

1622
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,460
That was really fast.

1623
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,920
I mean, I'm 73 right now.

1624
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,280
I love abusing triple support.

1625
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,500
It's so fun as a support player.

1626
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,260
Hahaha!

1627
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:53,010
Oh!

1628
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,210
So bound!

1629
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:57,630
All does nothing!

1630
01:27:58,210 --> 01:27:58,910
Hahaha!

1631
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:01,190
Yay!

1632
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:05,410
Let's go!

1633
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:08,530
Alright.

1634
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:12,990
I'll do...

1635
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:14,870
I'll do...

1636
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:16,170
I'll use a dot, I think.

1637
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:19,430
I don't like it.

1638
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,010
It's very hard to aim with.

1639
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:21,890
Wait.

1640
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:23,350
Have they had it?

1641
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:24,050
Yeah, they did.

1642
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:25,610
Okay, I'll rez.

1643
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:27,930
I'll rez.

1644
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:32,230
Unless...

1645
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:33,330
I'll rez.

1646
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:35,970
It'll be fine, right?

1647
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:37,710
It'll be fine.

1648
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:39,530
Wait, they will be fine.

1649
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:40,670
Yeah, not to worry.

1650
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:42,690
Oh!

1651
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:43,170
JK!

1652
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:45,150
Rez time!

1653
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:48,530
Hey there!

1654
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,630
Hello!

1655
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:54,470
Hahaha!

1656
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:58,150
Unlucky!

1657
01:28:58,770 --> 01:28:59,190
Hahaha!

1658
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:02,610
Hey, I don't...

1659
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:03,510
Oh, fuck!

1660
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:06,610
Aw, they saw me.

1661
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:08,450
That was funny, though.

1662
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:09,530
I was like, hey.

1663
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:11,510
That's awkward.

1664
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,330
Very awkward, but...

1665
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:14,850
Hahaha!

1666
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:15,070
Hahaha!

1667
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:18,270
Okay.

1668
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:20,130
Hahaha!

1669
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:23,410
That's pretty funny.

1670
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:24,310
Oh, fuck.

1671
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:24,890
I can't.

1672
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:26,490
I can't do it in the middle of this.

1673
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:28,270
Haha, surprise!

1674
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:33,690
How did I lose that after I got the kill on the Adam?

1675
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:35,170
Dude, what the fuck?

1676
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:40,730
How the fuck did I lose that after?

1677
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:42,990
I literally got like the...

1678
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:45,150
the kill.

1679
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:47,010
That's crazy.

1680
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,290
Oh, I thought I would be dead.

1681
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:53,950
Goodbye.

1682
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:55,250
Hahaha!

1683
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:58,830
He knew he fucked up there.

1684
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:01,610
Oh, I thought he was gonna ult.

1685
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:03,530
I was getting ready for that.

1686
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:08,450
Goodbye.

1687
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:10,990
Oh no, I was trying to...

1688
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,150
Oh, I didn't shift in time.

1689
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:13,630
That was my bad.

1690
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,230
I threw that.

1691
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:16,150
I should have shifted.

1692
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:18,750
I was being really cocky there.

1693
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,130
Oh, I played too cocky there.

1694
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:24,610
I thought I didn't need it, so I was like, no shift!

1695
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:26,510
But...

1696
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:27,850
Yes shift, apparently.

1697
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,390
Yes shift.

1698
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:31,530
Wait, they used portal.

1699
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:32,230
Nice.

1700
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:33,090
They wasted portal.

1701
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:36,750
They wasted portal.

1702
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:38,530
I kept my shift, at least.

1703
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:41,790
I'm playing with a little debuff though.

1704
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:43,570
With no...

1705
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:44,950
I'm playing with a little debuff.

1706
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:48,310
With the lack of...

1707
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:49,490
With the...

1708
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:51,070
I don't like this crosshair.

1709
01:30:51,310 --> 01:30:52,290
It makes me sad.

1710
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:53,490
I can't aim with it.

1711
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:56,910
Wait, do I have raw input on this account?

1712
01:30:57,050 --> 01:30:57,610
I don't remember.

1713
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:58,670
I think I did.

1714
01:30:58,750 --> 01:30:59,750
Yeah, I do.

1715
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:02,290
I should have raw input on this.

1716
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:03,390
Alright, let's go.

1717
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:04,490
Let's go in here.

1718
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:08,130
Well...

1719
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,210
Soap on us, and I have rez.

1720
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:12,870
I rez in the sky.

1721
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:16,930
And then if she lives, then...

1722
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:17,350
Oh!

1723
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:18,890
Oh, he's dead.

1724
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:19,990
Nice.

1725
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:21,850
Why?

1726
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:23,750
Oh, he had heals.

1727
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:24,610
Okay, I was gonna say.

1728
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:30,350
I'm gonna watch for a little bit.

1729
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,030
Oh, what the fuck?!

1730
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:35,010
He turned around?!

1731
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:36,250
Really?!

1732
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:37,910
He turned around!

1733
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,680
I can't believe it!

1734
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:44,680
It's not default.

1735
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:46,040
Raw input is not default.

1736
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,160
He actually...

1737
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:49,660
I didn't even move!

1738
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,100
I can't believe it!

1739
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,160
I didn't even shoot!

1740
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,680
He turned for no reason!

1741
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:57,300
Okay.

1742
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,240
Let me change it now.

1743
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,900
Get rid of... I need to get rid of one.

1744
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:05,640
Get rid of this.

1745
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:07,400
See?

1746
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,620
That's a good default.

1747
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:12,400
Is that good?

1748
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,640
I need the circle to be bigger.

1749
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:16,900
Uh...

1750
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,600
Dot with details.

1751
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,180
Oh my god, there's too many!

1752
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:23,580
Uh...

1753
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,860
Dot with details.

1754
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:27,620
I want this.

1755
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,200
No, that's the outline.

1756
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,420
Oh wait, that's the outline.

1757
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,340
Outline with details.

1758
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,080
Oh my gosh, my head is gonna explode.

1759
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:37,980
There we go.

1760
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,280
I need it to be a little bigger.

1761
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,160
I can't see it.

1762
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:42,480
There we go.

1763
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,520
I'm way too blind of this.

1764
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,180
Actually, no, this is too big.

1765
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:50,900
Oh, this is fine.

1766
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:51,560
There we go.

1767
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:52,440
Alright.

1768
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,840
I can't believe he saw me.

1769
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,960
He ignored me for so long!

1770
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,040
I literally was just standing there for so fucking long!

1771
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,020
I was like, he can't see me.

1772
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,280
And then he turns around?

1773
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:08,740
Fucking freaks.

1774
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,280
I should not have done that.

1775
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:11,580
I wasted that.

1776
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:15,660
What if I just left click?

1777
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:16,740
We're fine.

1778
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:18,680
I believe it.

1779
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,200
They didn't even know how to use this.

1780
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:24,180
Bye.

1781
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:26,020
You're okay.

1782
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:29,680
You're so healthy.

1783
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:33,360
You're so healthy.

1784
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:37,100
I so bought you so you can be healthier.

1785
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,140
Look at that.

1786
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,520
Nice.

1787
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:43,800
Oh!

1788
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:46,660
You hid from me!

1789
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:51,820
There we go.

1790
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:55,000
I give that to him just because I thought he was gonna die.

1791
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:56,400
Oh, nope, but he's gonna die.

1792
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:56,640
Okay.

1793
01:33:59,300 --> 01:33:59,780
Okay.

1794
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:03,000
Please don't die, guys.

1795
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:03,960
What?

1796
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,440
What the fuck?

1797
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:12,420
Hey, guys.

1798
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,220
I don't know about that.

1799
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,800
I don't feel healthy.

1800
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:18,040
What?

1801
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:23,440
What is this ult that I'm hearing?

1802
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:28,140
I hear some freaky ass ult right now.

1803
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,080
Okay.

1804
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,800
I'm backing up a little bit.

1805
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,220
Oh my god.

1806
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,600
Like, I'm just...

1807
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,280
I just wanna know where did our Mantis go?

1808
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,280
Is our Mantis okay?

1809
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:49,860
No, please, Strange.

1810
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,300
Not again, Strange.

1811
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:52,700
Not again!

1812
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,240
There we go.

1813
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:59,040
This is not a good place for rezzes at all.

1814
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:05,810
I heard the ult at their spot.

1815
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:09,050
I was like, what happened?

1816
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:12,570
Why was the ult at their spot?

1817
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:14,430
Hey, there's a Mantis there.

1818
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:16,670
We got this.

1819
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:17,970
I believe in our Mantis.

1820
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:22,990
Nice.

1821
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:26,110
Okay, Mr. Mosquito, get out of here!

1822
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,010
Is there a fucking mosquito?

1823
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:33,910
Who's dying?

1824
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:35,170
Oh, it's our Mantis.

1825
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:41,650
Okay, there we go.

1826
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:49,350
Like, she just walked up to me and just started fucking hitting me.

1827
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,250
Like, freak.

1828
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:52,710
Oh, and then I get exiled.

1829
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:54,010
Okay, fuck you.

1830
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:56,750
Actually, fuck you.

1831
01:35:58,450 --> 01:35:58,830
Okay.

1832
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:07,330
Same.

1833
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:08,910
Same, Miss Invisible.

1834
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:12,130
I'll just fight down here.

1835
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:13,130
You know what?

1836
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:15,570
Fuck it, I believe.

1837
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:16,630
Wait, where did she?

1838
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:18,710
Why did she die there?

1839
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:25,410
I was like, where did our Mantis die?

1840
01:36:26,010 --> 01:36:30,870
I was like, I saw our Mantis dead.

1841
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:33,710
She was like, at their spot.

1842
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:38,290
I was like, okay, I got our Mantis.

1843
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:38,950
Don't worry.

1844
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:41,590
I wasted that.

1845
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:50,570
I legitimately was so fucking confident about our fucking Mantis being alive near us.

1846
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:54,510
She was at their spot!

1847
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:58,770
She was at their fucking spot!

1848
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:02,770
I wasted that all, but that's okay.

1849
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:05,310
We all meant nothing anyway.

1850
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:13,530
The Mantis knows something we don't.

1851
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:14,990
What is she doing?

1852
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:16,230
What is in her mind?

1853
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:21,670
She swapped sides!

1854
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:23,530
Blue swapped to red side.

1855
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:26,030
Puero, puero, puero!

1856
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:28,230
Oh, never mind.

1857
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:29,590
Oh, they're opening a puero.

1858
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:35,390
Alright, that'll be on their high ground then.

1859
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:39,550
No?

1860
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:43,170
You open portal and you don't go on high ground?

1861
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:47,070
That is some next-level strat, that's for sure.

1862
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:55,830
Oh, they're running triple tank.

1863
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:59,510
They're actual nerds.

1864
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:06,070
They're running triple tank with triple support.

1865
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:07,470
They have no damage though.

1866
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:11,090
They have no damage.

1867
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:15,190
I am the damage now.

1868
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:23,010
I guess it's literally me and the... oh my god.

1869
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:26,090
I guess I'd respawn in front of them.

1870
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:28,610
Oh, I should not have respawned.

1871
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:29,650
I mean, it's gonna work.

1872
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:32,290
They're literally running triple tank.

1873
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:35,170
We need like...

1874
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:36,950
Yeah, I'm backing out.

1875
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:40,450
Me and the star lord are the only damage.

1876
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:46,730
That's okay, we'll save each other.

1877
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:48,070
There we go.

1878
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:51,890
I had to waste soul bond, but at least we're all six now.

1879
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:55,030
And I got rez off of that?

1880
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:56,870
Jesus Christ!

1881
01:38:57,930 --> 01:39:01,110
I actually built rez in like one fight.

1882
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:03,390
That's crazy.

1883
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:08,990
I don't remember what count There's like a specific thing to play to counter it.

1884
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:11,890
Like, not Wolverine.

1885
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:14,830
If Wolverine is bad, you can...

1886
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:15,450
Oh god.

1887
01:39:15,810 --> 01:39:16,670
If Wolverine...

1888
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:19,790
Is he at 100?

1889
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:21,950
Yeah, he was.

1890
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:22,950
That's smart.

1891
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:25,290
That's smart.

1892
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:27,270
Oh my god, that was really smart.

1893
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:31,590
He was at 100.

1894
01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:34,510
He went through the invis.

1895
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:44,870
There's like a character I was told in Rivals that if they run triple tank, it's not Wolverine, it's something else.

1896
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:54,770
Like, Wolverine helps too, but like, there's a character stronger than Wolverine against triple tank, and I don't remember what it was on the top of my head.

1897
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:56,410
Nice.

1898
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:58,550
Oh my god.

1899
01:39:58,930 --> 01:39:59,870
Soul bonus.

1900
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:06,310
Alright.

1901
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:10,510
Let's go!

1902
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:13,330
Oh nice, he didn't have ult.

1903
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:16,570
Nice.

1904
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:18,090
Control C's!

1905
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:20,410
Alright.

1906
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:23,710
Was it Moon Knight?

1907
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:24,350
Oh fuck.

1908
01:40:24,450 --> 01:40:24,690
Okay.

1909
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:25,690
Is it worth?

1910
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,670
I think it's worth it.

1911
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:30,150
I think it's worth it.

1912
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:32,470
They're fighting now.

1913
01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:37,050
I want us to be six before we fight.

1914
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:44,750
I think it's worth it because they would have pushed us if it wasn't.

1915
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:50,650
Now we have like, we got extra...

1916
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:58,210
I wish I have another.

1917
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:06,210
I wish I have another one.

1918
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:07,770
I'm sorry, buddy.

1919
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:13,690
I didn't think you would insta-die.

1920
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:14,970
Not gonna lie.

1921
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:19,010
That's the only reason why.

1922
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:21,730
I didn't think you would insta-die.

1923
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:23,930
Okay, it's not worth it anymore.

1924
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:27,710
There's no...

1925
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:29,030
Okay.

1926
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:35,370
We want four.

1927
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:41,630
There we go.

1928
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,660
There we go.

1929
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,820
There we go.

1930
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:03,850
Alright.

1931
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:06,550
Alright.

1932
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:10,070
Okay.

1933
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,210
Can't be that bad now.

1934
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:13,110
Alright.

1935
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:15,990
That was awkward though.

1936
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:23,140
Oh god.

1937
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:25,840
Oh god.

1938
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,660
Okay.

1939
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,560
I'll take that.

1940
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:04,600
Okay.

1941
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:12,980
Okay.

1942
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:15,280
I think that...

1943
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,220
Not gonna lie...

1944
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:20,660
I carry that.

1945
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:24,060
I 100% carry that fight.

1946
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:32,900
There's no way I did not carry that after what I just did for the team.

1947
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,400
Not even close.

1948
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:47,300
It's like, goodbye Hulk!

1949
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:48,300
Goodbye!

1950
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:51,900
I take that.

1951
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,600
I feel that.

1952
01:43:59,000 --> 01:43:59,900
Fly high!

1953
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:03,320
I think he made it.

1954
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,120
Thank you for the Twitch prompt.

1955
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:06,480
Thank you.

1956
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:09,360
That was easy.

1957
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,440
Easiest lowkey game of my life.

1958
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:16,060
He met God.

1959
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:20,080
I fucked him over like two times too.

1960
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,100
Like, I don't know why he tried to solo on me.

1961
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:32,150
He solo ulted me and lost his entire fucking life.

1962
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:35,410
Yeah, this is my ulti count.

1963
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:35,750
Yeah.

1964
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:38,210
It's my ulti count.

1965
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:40,770
It's my level 20 Eternity ulti count.

1966
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:42,970
It's not that hard to get to Eternity.

1967
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:44,450
Sorry.

1968
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:51,710
Like, Grandmaster in Celestial is so inflated.

1969
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:57,210
It's so inflated that it's really easy to climb if you've been in Eternity before.

1970
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:58,230
That's what I'll say.

1971
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:05,130
Like, if you've been in Eternity before, there's so many inflated players in GM and Celestial because there was no rank reset.

1972
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:11,410
As long as like, um, you know what you're doing, it's a lot easier to climb if you've been in Eternity before.

1973
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:15,870
You're a little... wild.

1974
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:16,930
So I'll play Adam.

1975
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:26,940
Yeah, like like, I feel like you can get to GM if you just spam play.

1976
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:28,640
Oh yeah, we should spam bug you.

1977
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:35,820
Like, you can get to GM by just playing so much.

1978
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:39,160
You can just play enough and then you'll get to GM.

1979
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:43,120
I've been hella ticked.

1980
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:44,640
Really?

1981
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:48,340
There's three hella players running around in the sky.

1982
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:50,940
It's 2-3 AM.

1983
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,640
It's one fucking...

1984
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,900
Are they really just bad hella?

1985
01:45:58,940 --> 01:45:59,920
I guess.

1986
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:03,240
I guess in a higher elo, everybody's a good hella player.

1987
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:06,640
Because we have a low-key player and they'll just do resets.

1988
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:08,480
And I'll just play Mantis with this.

1989
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:11,020
There's no reason.

1990
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:12,520
If we're doing...

1991
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:13,060
Oh, okay.

1992
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:15,360
I guess I'll go Luna?

1993
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:19,740
I was gonna say, I'd play Mantis if we're in triple support then.

1994
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:32,240
Like, the thing is in higher elo, almost every player every DPS player is a decent enough hella player so there's no reason to ban hella.

1995
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:36,620
Most likely just ban Groot.

1996
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:38,520
We ban things where you can...

1997
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,980
Groot is just so oppressive to play against.

1998
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:48,810
You don't get why...

1999
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:51,230
Bucky is the most...

2000
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:53,110
The best DPS character.

2001
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:59,010
In competitive and like actual esport competitive and in high elo.

2002
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:00,910
Bucky is the best character.

2003
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:02,510
Best DPS now.

2004
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:05,290
That's why he gets banned all the time.

2005
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:08,870
It's Bucky and Groot.

2006
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:10,630
That's like the most oppressive characters.

2007
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:13,410
And now it's... and Venom now too.

2008
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:14,970
Venom is so fucking...

2009
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:18,630
I hate playing against Venom players in one of our lobbies.

2010
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:20,590
It's so fucking frustrating.

2011
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:26,870
It's actually incredibly frustrating to play against because they're all really good too.

2012
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:32,190
And then even with freezes it's like my entire team has to do something about it.

2013
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:38,250
Oh there is a Flanking Jeff.

2014
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:40,670
So you know what that means.

2015
01:47:40,850 --> 01:47:42,130
Just ignore him.

2016
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:44,310
Don't align.

2017
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:49,690
That's unfortunate.

2018
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:57,570
That's what we get when we have to play with Jeff.

2019
01:47:58,050 --> 01:48:00,530
You guys wanted to play with against Groot.

2020
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:02,250
You guys wanted to.

2021
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:04,010
You wanted this.

2022
01:48:04,370 --> 01:48:06,330
You wanted to play against Groot.

2023
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:16,370
I would have banned Groot the first thing.

2024
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:17,470
Groot is my first ban.

2025
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:19,730
Groot is so fucking annoying.

2026
01:48:19,950 --> 01:48:20,710
I hate Groot.

2027
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:23,350
They wanted to keep Groot.

2028
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:24,290
This is what happened.

2029
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:26,470
They wanted this.

2030
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:30,170
They fucking wanted this.

2031
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:39,430
I want this.

2032
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:44,070
Oh my god.

2033
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:46,750
Why are we here?

2034
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:48,650
I just realized where we were.

2035
01:48:51,570 --> 01:48:52,950
Oh no, I'm so close.

2036
01:48:53,230 --> 01:48:54,790
No, I'm at 96.

2037
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:58,730
I didn't realize we're the strange fucking portalist.

2038
01:48:58,790 --> 01:48:59,990
Why are we there?

2039
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:01,630
Oh we got this.

2040
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:03,210
I was like, wait.

2041
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:04,170
What?

2042
01:49:06,130 --> 01:49:07,590
I just realized where we were.

2043
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:11,510
Thank god this is an ulti camp.

2044
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:15,450
It is good.

2045
01:49:15,610 --> 01:49:17,050
But I'm not going to be that rocket player.

2046
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:18,310
Okay.

2047
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:30,530
I forgot that...

2048
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:36,870
Alright, where's the...

2049
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:37,290
Why?

2050
01:49:37,690 --> 01:49:38,350
Wait, what?

2051
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:40,610
What?

2052
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:42,630
Why did...

2053
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:46,590
What?

2054
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,490
Why did...

2055
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:49,070
What?

2056
01:49:49,070 --> 01:49:49,510
Why did...

2057
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:50,410
What?

2058
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:54,190
I had so much time with my ult.

2059
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:04,270
I'm going lowkey.

2060
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:06,710
After that.

2061
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:09,090
Nerd boy is not it.

2062
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:11,630
What is he gonna...

2063
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:13,370
I...

2064
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:15,310
Um...

2065
01:50:15,310 --> 01:50:17,070
That...

2066
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:20,570
She's like...

2067
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:22,650
She's like, woah, you supported too?

2068
01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:24,610
Bro, check this out.

2069
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:29,870
That's fine.

2070
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:32,210
Oh, that's not fine.

2071
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:33,390
I couldn't do anything.

2072
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:36,410
The group was just on my ass.

2073
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:39,410
Like, I'm so confused.

2074
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:40,870
Like...

2075
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:41,570
Why?

2076
01:50:43,490 --> 01:50:45,750
Why did he ult that?

2077
01:50:45,870 --> 01:50:47,490
There was no reason to.

2078
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:49,570
I mean, they ban.

2079
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:50,810
They ban.

2080
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:52,590
Fucking really.

2081
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:55,950
That's why I hate playing against group players.

2082
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:59,450
I fucking hate playing against group players.

2083
01:50:59,970 --> 01:51:00,530
Goddammit.

2084
01:51:01,670 --> 01:51:02,790
Never anymore.

2085
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:05,270
I'm never...

2086
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:08,510
I'm never fucking letting group get unbanned.

2087
01:51:08,670 --> 01:51:10,190
It doesn't matter what ELO I am.

2088
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:12,370
It's the most...

2089
01:51:12,370 --> 01:51:13,690
Stupid ELO.

2090
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:17,910
It's the most stupid character I have to play with and play against.

2091
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:23,230
I might have to do this just to keep my venom alive.

2092
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:26,890
It's fine.

2093
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:27,510
I believe.

2094
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:30,490
The Psylocke technically is supposed to counter Jeff.

2095
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:31,750
We'll see soon.

2096
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:33,190
If that's the case.

2097
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:36,070
If you play Psylocke, you're a Jeff counter.

2098
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:38,970
So like, we'll see.

2099
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:40,510
We'll see.

2100
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:40,670
We'll see.

2101
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:48,150
I don't know why my invisible woman does not want to support me.

2102
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:51,830
She just hates me, I guess.

2103
01:51:52,770 --> 01:51:54,670
She just fucking hates me.

2104
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:56,770
She doesn't look behind her.

2105
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:58,150
I don't understand.

2106
01:51:58,650 --> 01:51:59,870
Yeah, Psylocke counters Jeff.

2107
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:00,610
It does.

2108
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:03,590
It's a Jeff counter.

2109
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:04,850
Cool.

2110
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:06,730
Cool?

2111
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:08,970
That's cool.

2112
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:11,690
Like...

2113
01:52:19,370 --> 01:52:24,570
Psylocke counters Jeff because at Psylocke, you can easily kill Jeff.

2114
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:26,130
Very fast.

2115
01:52:26,830 --> 01:52:34,890
I know this because every time we're against a Jeff player in high ELO in high Eternity, you always go...

2116
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:42,210
One of your DPS swaps to Psylocke and then that Jeff cannot do anything after that.

2117
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:47,030
That Jeff will actually basically be useless.

2118
01:52:50,310 --> 01:52:52,330
Especially when he ults.

2119
01:52:52,690 --> 01:52:55,030
A Psylocke can just ult the Jeff ult.

2120
01:52:57,130 --> 01:52:58,930
Scarlet Witch is useless.

2121
01:52:59,790 --> 01:53:00,890
No one plays Psy.

2122
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:09,390
I only know one person that plays Scarlet Witch in high ELO and he swaps if he gets countered.

2123
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:10,950
And he also gets avoided.

2124
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:12,190
I avoid him non-stop.

2125
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:18,190
He's decent at like Bucky but like...

2126
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:21,510
I'd rather have a DPS player that actually plays Bucky every time.

2127
01:53:22,210 --> 01:53:23,410
I really want to try that, Loki.

2128
01:53:23,970 --> 01:53:25,450
I think that would work, but we can try Dot.

2129
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:26,010
Let's try Dot.

2130
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:30,670
Yeah, Scarlet Witch at high ELO is fucking troll.

2131
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:34,590
I play Scarlet Witch when he can just run Psylocke.

2132
01:53:36,270 --> 01:53:37,350
No one's listening to that guy.

2133
01:53:37,410 --> 01:53:39,270
I don't even know who was talking, not gonna lie.

2134
01:53:39,670 --> 01:53:41,390
I do not know who was talking.

2135
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:43,670
I'm not playing Luna with this.

2136
01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:47,910
I might as well just get better at Loki.

2137
01:53:50,370 --> 01:53:53,610
Loki is one of the characters that I have yet to master.

2138
01:53:55,990 --> 01:53:59,910
Which is surprising because um, you know.

2139
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:02,450
Loki doki.

2140
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:05,590
Is he...

2141
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:07,410
Yeah.

2142
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:11,090
Goodbye.

2143
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:14,630
Literally that's all he needs to do.

2144
01:54:14,770 --> 01:54:15,830
He just needs to heal me.

2145
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:25,300
Okay.

2146
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:27,740
Alright.

2147
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,920
I'll just sit on cart.

2148
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:32,000
I'm just cart bitch.

2149
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:33,920
Cart bitch!

2150
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:34,840
Yay!

2151
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:42,640
Literally all he needs to do is literally just look at me.

2152
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,340
That's all he needs to do.

2153
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:48,300
That's sad.

2154
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:54,340
Are you really?

2155
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,260
Please.

2156
01:54:56,540 --> 01:54:56,940
Hahaha!

2157
01:54:58,760 --> 01:54:59,400
There you go.

2158
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:00,780
I can literally just stand there.

2159
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:02,760
They have to figure out which one is the real me.

2160
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:09,040
Okay, cool.

2161
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:11,360
Oh, we did not need that!

2162
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:12,100
But that's alright.

2163
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:15,880
I'm trying!

2164
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:17,260
Fuck, okay.

2165
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:20,140
Hey, do you like have my invuln?

2166
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:20,860
Woo!

2167
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:22,800
Go invuln!

2168
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:23,800
Woo!

2169
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:26,600
Where am I?

2170
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:27,460
Hahaha!

2171
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:30,440
Woah!

2172
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:36,760
That's fine, I'll just walk over.

2173
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:41,620
At least they have my invuln guys!

2174
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:42,560
Yippee!

2175
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:49,300
I'll just stand there like this.

2176
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:52,480
Nevermind, I guess I don't just stand there like that.

2177
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:53,360
Where's my cloak?

2178
01:55:58,320 --> 01:55:59,940
That was an accident.

2179
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:02,480
That was an accident.

2180
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:04,040
How did I?

2181
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,300
Oh my god.

2182
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:07,380
Woo!

2183
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,540
How did I get that?

2184
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:11,080
Oh, I fucked up my settings.

2185
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,400
It shouldn't be instant.

2186
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,420
I realized I don't have this.

2187
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:16,900
Hahaha!

2188
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,240
I didn't have this!

2189
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,520
I was like, where did my cloak?

2190
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,380
I was in front of my cloak!

2191
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,140
What happened?

2192
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:27,080
Hahaha!

2193
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:30,900
Was I not in front of my cloak?

2194
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:35,020
I don't know what the fuck happened to my cloak.

2195
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:39,340
It was my ulti count so I didn't have my double confirm.

2196
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,400
Did she like cloak herself?

2197
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,580
Is that what happened?

2198
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,460
Please, look at me!

2199
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,980
Please, look at me!

2200
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:53,740
Turn around!

2201
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,380
Oh my god!

2202
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:05,080
I just need you to be aware of your surroundings!

2203
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:07,400
Holy shit!

2204
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:11,360
Just be...

2205
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:14,120
Just be aware of your surroundings.

2206
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,360
That's all I ask.

2207
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:22,460
Okay.

2208
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:25,080
Oh my god!

2209
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:27,380
Support not...

2210
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:29,960
I love it when supports don't support each other.

2211
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,280
They're my favorite pastime in the world.

2212
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:36,580
It's actually my favorite pastime.

2213
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:42,340
It didn't matter what I do.

2214
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:43,340
Hahaha!

2215
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:45,840
Maybe?

2216
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:48,080
Oh my god.

2217
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:50,060
I can't do anything.

2218
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:53,780
He got me out of my cloak instantly.

2219
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:57,280
He got me out of invisibility instantly.

2220
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:59,640
How would Mantis help?

2221
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:01,660
How would it help you?

2222
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:06,900
Please explain how Mantis would be any better against Jeff!

2223
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:09,840
If anything, you should go sue!

2224
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:17,560
If anything, go sue!

2225
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:19,380
So you can push him away!

2226
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:21,340
How would...

2227
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:24,600
How would Mantis be any better?

2228
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:27,900
I don't understand your logic.

2229
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:33,820
I just don't understand the logic for this.

2230
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:39,100
Oh my god.

2231
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:41,060
Oh my god.

2232
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:43,700
Guys, I need...

2233
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:45,320
Please.

2234
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:47,360
I need another...

2235
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,680
Where is a different support that I can...

2236
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:51,500
That's not...

2237
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:52,480
Please.

2238
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:56,500
Oh my god.

2239
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:00,540
I don't understand.

2240
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:01,980
I...

2241
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:09,340
If you don't want to die to Jeff, please sue!

2242
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:15,500
This is gonna mean a lot right here.

2243
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:18,380
I have double support up for sure.

2244
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:19,520
Okay.

2245
01:59:21,620 --> 01:59:24,320
Like, makes zero sense.

2246
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:30,900
Okay.

2247
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:34,980
Goodbye.

2248
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:37,760
It doesn't matter where I go.

2249
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:42,660
It doesn't matter what happens.

2250
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,360
I can't...

2251
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:47,660
What do you want me to do?

2252
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:50,340
He ulted me in front of them!

2253
01:59:55,180 --> 02:00:00,380
I got ulted into Jeff and he threw me into team.

2254
02:00:04,220 --> 02:00:05,060
I...

2255
02:00:05,060 --> 02:00:07,980
What do you mean?

2256
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:10,920
I didn't mean to copy ult early!

2257
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:15,020
How...

2258
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:19,520
How could you not ult them?

2259
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,920
You should have copied...

2260
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:23,460
What do you mean?

2261
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,780
He go yum yum yum and I was yum yum dead.

2262
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:31,320
You should have copied early.

2263
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:34,680
Just don't get eaten, I guess.

2264
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:38,040
Predict the E that happens in one second.

2265
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,420
Just predicted, Forehead!

2266
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,520
Oh, let me... Yeah, let me do that now!

2267
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:56,180
There you go, let's go!

2268
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:57,500
Isn't that what you wanted?

2269
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,480
Oh, they're fucking dead.

2270
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:01,920
They said that.

2271
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:03,100
There we go.

2272
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:07,600
Oh my god.

2273
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:11,000
Fuck, I did not expect to be a fucking lowkey right now.

2274
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:16,560
Like, yeah?

2275
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:17,880
Okay, thank you.

2276
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:22,340
It's alright.

2277
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:25,180
I ulted early, that's what they wanted.

2278
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,460
Fucking om yum yum.

2279
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:36,020
Om yum yum, just ult early.

2280
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,000
Sorry, that made me so spiteful.

2281
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:39,260
Like, what the fuck?

2282
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:41,820
Can't just...

2283
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:45,400
Let go!

2284
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:46,340
Let's go!

2285
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:47,000
Om yum yum!

2286
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:48,480
Let's fucking go, I guess.

2287
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:52,040
There we go.

2288
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:54,600
I wish they would do that for me sometimes.

2289
02:01:58,240 --> 02:01:59,980
Just trying to get these up.

2290
02:02:05,790 --> 02:02:06,870
Okay, I need to reload.

2291
02:02:07,390 --> 02:02:09,710
Sorry guys, I'm fucking reloading right now.

2292
02:02:11,370 --> 02:02:13,030
Let's forget and dance.

2293
02:02:13,730 --> 02:02:14,970
Forget and dance.

2294
02:02:17,190 --> 02:02:18,450
Forget and dance.

2295
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:23,410
Yippee!

2296
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:35,390
Jeff just does his own thing.

2297
02:02:36,430 --> 02:02:37,530
You know what counters Jeff?

2298
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:39,550
You ignore the Jeff and walk forward.

2299
02:02:40,110 --> 02:02:42,230
Or the supports support each other.

2300
02:02:42,430 --> 02:02:44,050
But like, I can't have that.

2301
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:48,550
Apparently.

2302
02:02:50,070 --> 02:02:51,090
That doesn't exist.

2303
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:51,490
Alright.

2304
02:02:54,630 --> 02:02:59,370
Alright, I could go Sue here and then maybe I'll push the Jeff away.

2305
02:03:00,210 --> 02:03:02,090
Maybe that's...

2306
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:04,330
You think that will work, guys?

2307
02:03:04,330 --> 02:03:05,650
If I went...

2308
02:03:07,690 --> 02:03:10,670
I guess I'll push the Jeff away.

2309
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:19,160
I like the Loki more.

2310
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:22,220
Alright.

2311
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:27,280
I feel like I survived more on Loki.

2312
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:31,200
I went Loki because of the lack of survivability of my other support player.

2313
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:32,600
But I could go invisible.

2314
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:33,920
That's the thing.

2315
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:40,900
That's the thing.

2316
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,720
I'm just thinking like I could push him and go invisible too.

2317
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:48,340
But then like, Loki does give me more heals.

2318
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:49,420
We'll see.

2319
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:55,880
Yeah, I don't understand.

2320
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:57,220
I'll never understand.

2321
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:01,900
Okay.

2322
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:05,280
I thought he'd push up!

2323
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:09,740
I'm gonna save my shield.

2324
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:15,560
I have to push the Jeff this way.

2325
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:16,960
No, I can't.

2326
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:18,040
Yeah, I'm gonna go Loki.

2327
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,860
I'm gonna go Loki and use Enron.

2328
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:26,600
I have to push one or the other and I chose...

2329
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:30,420
I chose the group because he was in front of me.

2330
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:32,720
I was just like, who do I push off?

2331
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:36,380
The guy that's on top of me right now or the Jeff that's beside me?

2332
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:44,240
I don't really wanna use my clones but

2333
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:49,820
yeah, fuck this.

2334
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:52,000
I have to use Envon!

2335
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:55,400
Oh!

2336
02:04:58,780 --> 02:04:59,540
Alright,

2337
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:05,250
here we go.

2338
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:08,690
I'm going invisible.

2339
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:10,050
Now you can't hit me.

2340
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:13,370
That's the entire pattern.

2341
02:05:14,850 --> 02:05:15,330
Alright.

2342
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:22,570
What do you mean no support out?

2343
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:23,130
LIE!

2344
02:05:23,770 --> 02:05:26,090
I mean, we got the support out at least.

2345
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,580
I don't wanna use...

2346
02:05:33,580 --> 02:05:34,340
Yeah, that's what I said.

2347
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:40,320
Where's our...

2348
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:42,820
Alright.

2349
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:44,480
Okay.

2350
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:49,180
Alright.

2351
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:51,360
I dance now.

2352
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:52,520
Let's dance.

2353
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:53,740
Let's dance.

2354
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,240
Let's go.

2355
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:59,100
Oh, goodbye Luna.

2356
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:00,620
How did he...

2357
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:01,680
Oh, he got ulted.

2358
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:04,140
I was gonna say how did he get over there?

2359
02:06:07,940 --> 02:06:08,940
That's how.

2360
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:10,520
Okay.

2361
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:15,380
I hear him.

2362
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:24,500
No more bump bump.

2363
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:26,720
Apparently, no more.

2364
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:31,000
Okay.

2365
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:35,060
That's good.

2366
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,300
I got my Envon out at least.

2367
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:43,460
The only issue is that they do have Groot ult though now.

2368
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:46,880
Me!

2369
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:56,140
Yippee!

2370
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:57,820
As foretold.

2371
02:06:58,780 --> 02:07:03,180
As foretold, the Groot ult shows up.

2372
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:05,120
The moment.

2373
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:08,380
I knew it was gonna show up.

2374
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:09,100
That moment.

2375
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:15,540
I am a prophet.

2376
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,900
You know what that's called?

2377
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:17,860
Ult tracking.

2378
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:18,520
Woah!

2379
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:21,200
Oh my gosh.

2380
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:24,020
The power of ult tracking.

2381
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:28,040
That's the worst part about knowing when ults show up.

2382
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:29,700
Is that you have nothing...

2383
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,360
You can't do anything about it.

2384
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:34,700
Oh man, if we just run triple support it gets countered.

2385
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,680
There's nothing I can do.

2386
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:44,940
Yeah, don't chase him.

2387
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:47,120
If we play well enough together...

2388
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,100
There's nothing I can do.

2389
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:51,720
I don't chase.

2390
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:52,760
I literally just walk...

2391
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:55,380
Our fucking Luna chases him for some reason.

2392
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:58,420
Our Luna chases.

2393
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:04,100
They'll be coming in 30 seconds.

2394
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:05,120
Stay strong.

2395
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:10,800
It's like when you know what ult's coming up...

2396
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,560
And you can't do anything about it.

2397
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:13,880
I had no invuln.

2398
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:16,380
Had to use invulns for the Namor ult.

2399
02:08:18,180 --> 02:08:20,680
Witch Magneto can peel the supports harder.

2400
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:22,520
I know, a little bit.

2401
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:23,440
I got shit to do.

2402
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:25,800
I know, I know.

2403
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:29,220
Brother, I...

2404
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:31,780
Brother, I can't be...

2405
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:38,560
I got shit to do, brother.

2406
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:40,200
I can't be healing first.

2407
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:42,680
Sorry, I'm not healing now.

2408
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:45,400
Because that shit was fucking hilarious.

2409
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:49,000
What the fuck is going on?

2410
02:08:53,820 --> 02:08:54,300
Alright.

2411
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:57,640
Alright.

2412
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:01,400
He's got shit to do, guys.

2413
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:04,180
He can't be...

2414
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:07,080
Sorry.

2415
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:12,380
I had to heal the tank.

2416
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:13,160
Sorry, Luna.

2417
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:21,640
That little switcheroo on the Jeff was so...

2418
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:22,740
He was just like, what?

2419
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:31,480
I like how they said to peel for our support and there was no peel.

2420
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,540
I literally was like...

2421
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:34,820
I was like...

2422
02:09:34,820 --> 02:09:36,680
Okay, I disappear now.

2423
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:41,100
That was my peel.

2424
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:44,500
I disappear for...

2425
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:46,120
Okay.

2426
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:48,100
I hope that helps a little.

2427
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:49,880
Just a little though.

2428
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:52,440
I can't do much about it.

2429
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:54,300
This is crazy.

2430
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:57,160
You got a lowkey greener there, man.

2431
02:09:57,660 --> 02:09:58,560
You just won the fight.

2432
02:09:58,780 --> 02:09:59,220
What?

2433
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:01,560
What do you mean?

2434
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:04,160
What do you mean?

2435
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:05,520
I literally...

2436
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:08,580
The moment I got there, I died last.

2437
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:14,740
What are they on about?

2438
02:10:14,940 --> 02:10:16,140
I died last.

2439
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:18,040
I walked there as fast as I could.

2440
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:19,580
My little legs could take me.

2441
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:24,460
If we lamped there, we could have won.

2442
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:24,700
What?

2443
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:26,780
I did lamp though.

2444
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:28,980
Oh, there's another lamp.

2445
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,360
I disappear.

2446
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:39,700
I die.

2447
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:45,940
What do I do there?

2448
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:47,340
I just die.

2449
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:51,540
Here I go.

2450
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:54,200
Remember when they said they'd peel for our support?

2451
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:56,920
I don't think that happened.

2452
02:10:58,620 --> 02:11:01,000
I don't think our support ever got peeled.

2453
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:05,420
Yeah, you could go invisible and then...

2454
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:09,260
You go invisible and...

2455
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,760
And then you don't get ulted.

2456
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:22,740
We just never got peeled at all.

2457
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:25,380
To be fair, I could have said something.

2458
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:26,960
But I was just like...

2459
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:29,180
But I wasn't the one that was in the most trouble.

2460
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:32,080
It was our other support that was getting bullied even more.

2461
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:34,280
It was only when our other support dies...

2462
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:36,000
When he starts going after me.

2463
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:38,320
But at that point, there was just no saving me.

2464
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:44,240
Our other support never said anything too.

2465
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,480
So it was like...

2466
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:46,820
I guess we both die.

2467
02:11:50,630 --> 02:11:53,910
You had to voice vocalize the peel too.

2468
02:11:57,700 --> 02:11:59,420
But how to...

2469
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:01,120
How to beat a Jeff...

2470
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:02,480
Is to literally ignore him.

2471
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,300
If you just are Luna...

2472
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:07,940
Try to 1v1 the Jeff every time.

2473
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:10,320
Which was like...

2474
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:12,640
A choice.

2475
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,020
I mean, he literally swapped to Mantis.

2476
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:23,880
I was like, why are you on Mantis?

2477
02:12:28,370 --> 02:12:30,250
I could have said something.

2478
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:32,170
But I also don't feel like talking right now.

2479
02:12:32,490 --> 02:12:32,910
In game.

2480
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:34,610
Especially...

2481
02:12:37,530 --> 02:12:38,130
Especially...

2482
02:12:38,130 --> 02:12:40,610
Right now at 3.30 in the morning.

2483
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,880
Oh, my Celestial lobbies.

2484
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:47,960
Wow.

2485
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:51,620
It's 3.30 right now.

2486
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:54,420
I don't expect people to be communicating at all.

2487
02:12:57,820 --> 02:12:59,160
What do I feel like?

2488
02:12:59,380 --> 02:13:00,280
Oh, we have a Mantis.

2489
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,180
I have to go main heal.

2490
02:13:03,240 --> 02:13:04,040
That means...

2491
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:05,420
I'm on another account.

2492
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:06,460
Do we have a name?

2493
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:07,460
Oh, nice.

2494
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:09,820
I'm gonna...

2495
02:13:09,820 --> 02:13:10,800
We're solo thing.

2496
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:12,560
Which is the worst thing you can go.

2497
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:15,860
Why Cloak and Dagger?

2498
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:16,700
Are you stupid?

2499
02:13:17,740 --> 02:13:18,700
I'm getting water.

2500
02:13:55,810 --> 02:13:57,290
Did my team do the right bans?

2501
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,010
Oh, thank god.

2502
02:13:59,210 --> 02:14:00,690
We ban Adam?

2503
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:02,990
When I'm clearly hovering over Adam?

2504
02:14:03,490 --> 02:14:04,810
They are stupid.

2505
02:14:05,110 --> 02:14:10,570
Oh, my god.

2506
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:13,870
My little...

2507
02:14:13,870 --> 02:14:14,710
Special little guys.

2508
02:14:14,980 --> 02:14:16,430
Oh, look at that, bro.

2509
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:19,230
What a fucking goat.

2510
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:28,690
My special little guys.

2511
02:14:28,990 --> 02:14:30,510
Wait, was it him that banned it?

2512
02:14:35,490 --> 02:14:37,230
3 support is...

2513
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:43,270
3 support is...

2514
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:46,170
The easiest thing you can play in rank.

2515
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:48,750
It doesn't work in competitive esports.

2516
02:14:50,350 --> 02:14:56,890
Triple support and triple tank is the easiest Ongobunga comp you can win if you're very desperate for ELO.

2517
02:14:57,610 --> 02:14:58,830
Or if you have 3 supports.

2518
02:14:59,050 --> 02:15:01,310
And in this ELO, there's a lot of support players.

2519
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:10,290
But the thing is, as a solo tank, it's not it.

2520
02:15:10,290 --> 02:15:11,810
It's the one that's most...

2521
02:15:11,810 --> 02:15:16,650
The thing is, one of the top 3 to tanks you should not run as a solo tank.

2522
02:15:19,150 --> 02:15:21,670
Oh, okay.

2523
02:15:21,950 --> 02:15:22,690
Fuck me, I guess.

2524
02:15:22,730 --> 02:15:24,190
Guess I'll play on fucking low ground.

2525
02:15:24,430 --> 02:15:25,390
Doesn't let me play on.

2526
02:15:27,250 --> 02:15:28,130
I mean...

2527
02:15:28,130 --> 02:15:29,070
I need to learn.

2528
02:15:29,310 --> 02:15:33,270
The thing I don't know how to do low key very well is my F.

2529
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:35,050
I'm really bad at using my F.

2530
02:15:36,590 --> 02:15:37,170
Uh...

2531
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:42,530
I'm really bad at using my F for...

2532
02:15:43,290 --> 02:15:44,670
Oh my god.

2533
02:15:45,330 --> 02:15:47,110
This is why we don't solo tank.

2534
02:15:47,670 --> 02:15:48,410
That's the thing.

2535
02:15:49,070 --> 02:15:52,270
I don't know how to use my F well enough.

2536
02:15:53,370 --> 02:15:56,390
I like always mess it up.

2537
02:15:57,410 --> 02:15:58,410
I mess it up a lot.

2538
02:16:01,610 --> 02:16:02,590
Mag won.

2539
02:16:04,570 --> 02:16:06,030
I have to reload.

2540
02:16:10,130 --> 02:16:11,450
You can run him.

2541
02:16:11,650 --> 02:16:13,450
You just can't run him as a solo tank.

2542
02:16:14,590 --> 02:16:20,970
Oh, I hear you.

2543
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:23,930
How did he not...

2544
02:16:23,930 --> 02:16:24,650
Taz!

2545
02:16:25,190 --> 02:16:32,650
LOL This is what separates a Celestial player from an Eternity player.

2546
02:16:33,190 --> 02:16:37,250
LOL Like...

2547
02:16:37,250 --> 02:16:39,910
How are you not aware?

2548
02:16:40,430 --> 02:16:41,810
You press tab.

2549
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:51,510
Please tell me they...

2550
02:16:57,450 --> 02:16:57,970
Okay.

2551
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:04,410
Hey guys.

2552
02:17:07,710 --> 02:17:09,150
You know what would be cool right now?

2553
02:17:09,610 --> 02:17:11,130
Luna, flash damage when I ult.

2554
02:17:12,810 --> 02:17:13,610
No, no, no, no, no.

2555
02:17:13,870 --> 02:17:14,150
I missed.

2556
02:17:15,590 --> 02:17:29,450
LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL There we go.

2557
02:17:29,590 --> 02:17:36,570
LOL That's very unfortunate that he missed though.

2558
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:38,450
LOL

2559
02:17:41,490 --> 02:17:42,430
There we go.

2560
02:17:42,670 --> 02:17:43,610
That's unfortunate.

2561
02:17:45,150 --> 02:17:46,110
I missed.

2562
02:17:48,830 --> 02:17:49,910
Nice try though.

2563
02:17:50,090 --> 02:17:50,730
Nice try.

2564
02:17:51,550 --> 02:17:52,570
Appreciate... Good effort.

2565
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:53,230
Good effort.

2566
02:17:54,410 --> 02:17:55,290
Very good effort.

2567
02:17:56,650 --> 02:17:57,690
At least he was honest.

2568
02:17:57,790 --> 02:17:59,810
I'm surprised I didn't get ulted there.

2569
02:18:01,050 --> 02:18:03,770
I stood next to my Mag because it's like...

2570
02:18:03,770 --> 02:18:08,950
You assume that your Mag has all...

2571
02:18:09,230 --> 02:18:10,670
Or not all, has like...

2572
02:18:11,330 --> 02:18:12,370
Yeah, I got you.

2573
02:18:14,250 --> 02:18:17,130
Oh, there he is.

2574
02:18:21,770 --> 02:18:24,230
We're just flanking you guys.

2575
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:25,750
Oh, there we go.

2576
02:18:26,910 --> 02:18:28,090
And we still have Manta's ult.

2577
02:18:28,810 --> 02:18:29,970
We're gonna use it, right?

2578
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:32,790
We're gonna use it, right?

2579
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:33,350
Oh, wait.

2580
02:18:33,430 --> 02:18:34,070
Okay, there we go.

2581
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:36,870
Oh, he didn't kill him in time.

2582
02:18:40,570 --> 02:18:41,850
Alright, it's fine.

2583
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:45,470
It's fine, I'm coming back.

2584
02:18:45,550 --> 02:18:46,130
Don't worry.

2585
02:18:46,890 --> 02:18:48,250
I'm coming back, guys.

2586
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:54,390
There is a Bucky, so I might have to swap off Loki.

2587
02:18:54,570 --> 02:18:55,190
I don't know.

2588
02:18:55,790 --> 02:18:57,770
Depends on like how well...

2589
02:18:57,770 --> 02:18:58,450
How...

2590
02:18:59,270 --> 02:19:01,230
How much they take advantage.

2591
02:19:04,490 --> 02:19:05,510
That's unlucky.

2592
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:07,270
We got nothing.

2593
02:19:11,150 --> 02:19:15,890
Yeah, that's why I was like...

2594
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:17,830
I was like... It's unfortunate.

2595
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:20,770
I might have to swap off Loki if he's a good enough Bucky.

2596
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,360
It's fine, I believe.

2597
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:30,340
I believe.

2598
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:33,860
I didn't believe anymore.

2599
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:34,860
I...

2600
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:41,760
Hello, I'm back.

2601
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:45,220
I did not want to be back.

2602
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:48,060
I did not consent to be back, but I'm back.

2603
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:50,120
I'm back.

2604
02:19:53,660 --> 02:19:54,220
Alright.

2605
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:57,760
Damn, I'm healing botting too much.

2606
02:19:57,880 --> 02:19:59,040
I need DPS as Loki.

2607
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:02,900
I'm too scared to go up.

2608
02:20:09,590 --> 02:20:11,950
I'm heal botting way too much.

2609
02:20:13,090 --> 02:20:14,430
I need to do more damage.

2610
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:15,670
I have like three of me.

2611
02:20:17,230 --> 02:20:17,990
There's three of me.

2612
02:20:18,010 --> 02:20:19,390
I should be doing damage.

2613
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:21,790
Oh my god.

2614
02:20:23,510 --> 02:20:24,330
It's fine.

2615
02:20:28,250 --> 02:20:29,130
It's fine.

2616
02:20:33,250 --> 02:20:33,730
Okay.

2617
02:20:34,270 --> 02:20:36,130
What is hitting me?

2618
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:36,690
There it is.

2619
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:47,160
Okay.

2620
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:52,900
Okay.

2621
02:20:56,840 --> 02:20:57,360
Okay.

2622
02:20:57,360 --> 02:20:58,800
Oh fuck, I didn't realize I was still Luna.

2623
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:03,220
Oh, thank god.

2624
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:05,400
I got the shift ready for him though.

2625
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:11,920
Oh, that's unlucky for him.

2626
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:15,800
I have to do this for our Mag because I don't think he'll live.

2627
02:21:16,860 --> 02:21:16,900
Guys.

2628
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:20,140
There's these.

2629
02:21:21,220 --> 02:21:21,780
Guys.

2630
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:23,680
Guys.

2631
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:28,440
Why did we just let him do that?

2632
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:32,680
Why did we just let him have squids like that?

2633
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:36,120
Guys.

2634
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:36,300
Guys.

2635
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:41,740
Okay, he's not getting it from me.

2636
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:42,500
That's for sure.

2637
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:47,880
Who is?

2638
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:01,140
That's crazy.

2639
02:22:09,360 --> 02:22:11,540
That's actually crazy.

2640
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,740
You know what?

2641
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,360
You know what I feel like playing?

2642
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:28,860
No way.

2643
02:22:29,620 --> 02:22:31,480
Do I do it?

2644
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:33,380
Let's go.

2645
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:40,420
Let's go.

2646
02:22:43,810 --> 02:22:44,860
It's time.

2647
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:47,060
This is 4am Doki.

2648
02:22:49,690 --> 02:22:52,100
4am Doki's about to...

2649
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:54,410
I've lost my mind.

2650
02:22:56,470 --> 02:22:56,950
Bruh.

2651
02:23:00,830 --> 02:23:05,110
This is gonna be the most engaging gameplay of your time.

2652
02:23:05,310 --> 02:23:05,670
Guys.

2653
02:23:05,810 --> 02:23:06,590
Wait, what the fuck?

2654
02:23:06,830 --> 02:23:07,910
Why don't you play Luna?

2655
02:23:10,270 --> 02:23:10,770
That's fine.

2656
02:23:14,450 --> 02:23:15,770
Don't worry, we have res.

2657
02:23:16,690 --> 02:23:17,930
Heals for days.

2658
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:21,170
This is gonna be the most engaging gameplay you've ever seen.

2659
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:22,970
Not boring.

2660
02:23:22,970 --> 02:23:25,490
No, not boring at all.

2661
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:30,840
Oh my god, this is it.

2662
02:23:35,210 --> 02:23:38,910
Guys, okay, I was gonna say like guys.

2663
02:23:43,090 --> 02:23:47,910
Don't worry, if I never stop holding right click, they'll never die.

2664
02:23:48,470 --> 02:23:50,390
That's how it goes, right?

2665
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:56,820
That should be how it goes.

2666
02:24:01,630 --> 02:24:04,130
Whoa, I heal myself too.

2667
02:24:04,690 --> 02:24:05,930
That's the best part.

2668
02:24:07,310 --> 02:24:07,950
Go in there.

2669
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:08,710
Go in there.

2670
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:09,430
You got- oh.

2671
02:24:12,190 --> 02:24:15,090
Oh my god, don't worry.

2672
02:24:17,330 --> 02:24:18,930
Don't worry, guys.

2673
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:24,970
Just- oh, that's unfortunate.

2674
02:24:25,490 --> 02:24:27,050
That's very unfortunate for you.

2675
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:28,070
Strange.

2676
02:24:31,710 --> 02:24:35,590
Guys, will we ever kill the Magneto?

2677
02:24:35,710 --> 02:24:36,490
Let's find out.

2678
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:40,390
Where is my team?

2679
02:24:57,470 --> 02:24:59,250
You gotta look for Luna.

2680
02:25:06,850 --> 02:25:09,510
What do you want me to do?

2681
02:25:10,130 --> 02:25:12,190
It's not my fault we're losing.

2682
02:25:13,370 --> 02:25:15,810
It's absolutely not my fault.

2683
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:16,990
It's not.

2684
02:25:16,990 --> 02:25:17,930
It's not Roggen's fault.

2685
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:20,710
I guess I can say that for a lot of reasons.

2686
02:25:21,470 --> 02:25:25,490
It is definitely- Yeah, not my fault.

2687
02:25:25,490 --> 02:25:28,890
I literally was the only one healing there.

2688
02:25:29,870 --> 02:25:31,390
Let me know when you're ready.

2689
02:25:31,810 --> 02:25:33,330
She knows, they know, they know.

2690
02:25:38,090 --> 02:25:40,670
That's crazy that I was playing.

2691
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:49,810
No, our Luna complained that it was my fault.

2692
02:25:50,490 --> 02:25:51,150
Really?

2693
02:25:51,150 --> 02:25:51,290
Really?

2694
02:25:53,230 --> 02:25:59,530
That was actually- That was not the blame here.

2695
02:26:01,690 --> 02:26:03,090
Post supports.

2696
02:26:05,810 --> 02:26:07,390
That's crazy.

2697
02:26:10,530 --> 02:26:11,670
So maybe-

2698
02:26:15,690 --> 02:26:17,110
That's crazy.

2699
02:26:23,510 --> 02:26:24,070
Welp.

2700
02:26:24,810 --> 02:26:25,730
Hey, I lived.

2701
02:26:29,170 --> 02:26:30,230
Hey, I lived.

2702
02:26:39,690 --> 02:26:41,790
Let's just- Let's freaking go up.

2703
02:26:42,750 --> 02:26:43,130
Welp.

2704
02:26:44,810 --> 02:26:45,370
Welp.

2705
02:26:45,750 --> 02:26:46,610
Welp, I lived.

2706
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:48,910
That's how you fucking play in eternity.

2707
02:26:49,630 --> 02:26:51,550
I don't think they'll understand that.

2708
02:26:54,270 --> 02:26:56,590
I don't think they have the game sense for that.

2709
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:05,720
Easy.

2710
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:08,680
Welp.

2711
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:13,800
It's surprising how they don't even kill squids, too.

2712
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:16,440
It's winnable, chat.

2713
02:27:17,620 --> 02:27:19,220
It's winnable, yes.

2714
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:20,920
Don't have a weak mental.

2715
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:21,820
Locked in.

2716
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:25,840
That's crazy.

2717
02:27:25,980 --> 02:27:27,720
I don't usually have a weak mental, to be honest with you.

2718
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:28,780
We're just getting walked.

2719
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:31,000
Or being dumb, is the word.

2720
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:36,540
Oh no, our team is incredibly stupid.

2721
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:40,380
But it is this- It's three in the morning.

2722
02:27:40,580 --> 02:27:47,400
I am not playing as if like- Literally, this stream just walks up to us.

2723
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:50,520
Don't walk.

2724
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:50,860
Don't walk.

2725
02:27:55,990 --> 02:28:08,330
If you're playing at four in the morning, you do not come into these lobbies thinking that these games are gonna be like- Bro, I have the least deaths out of all my support.

2726
02:28:08,470 --> 02:28:09,870
How am I getting blamed?

2727
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:13,150
I literally played the best positioning out of my supports.

2728
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:15,830
And I'm not playing the best positioning right now.

2729
02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:19,190
I'm playing so fucking stupid.

2730
02:28:21,950 --> 02:28:22,790
What?

2731
02:28:24,790 --> 02:28:26,990
That's what I'm fucking saying, bro.

2732
02:28:27,690 --> 02:28:29,610
That's what I've been saying this whole goddamn game.

2733
02:28:30,970 --> 02:28:31,630
We got Goro.

2734
02:28:39,810 --> 02:28:42,590
At least I get validated.

2735
02:28:43,970 --> 02:28:46,230
I'm getting validation.

2736
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:47,590
I think I'll die.

2737
02:28:47,970 --> 02:28:48,530
Okay.

2738
02:28:50,570 --> 02:28:56,330
You do not go in at 4am expecting these games to go the way they're gonna go.

2739
02:28:58,830 --> 02:29:03,450
I have Agumoto though.

2740
02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:05,750
You know what would be great?

2741
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:07,270
If we had a Luna ult there.

2742
02:29:08,030 --> 02:29:08,550
Absolutely.

2743
02:29:09,810 --> 02:29:10,490
There we go.

2744
02:29:16,230 --> 02:29:17,170
Oh, they charged it.

2745
02:29:17,210 --> 02:29:18,030
Did they charge it?

2746
02:29:18,450 --> 02:29:19,110
Let's see.

2747
02:29:19,970 --> 02:29:21,770
What is this crosshair?

2748
02:29:23,650 --> 02:29:25,070
Yeah, it was charged.

2749
02:29:25,770 --> 02:29:26,610
Oh, that's unlucky.

2750
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:31,990
No, no, no, no, no.

2751
02:29:32,010 --> 02:29:32,350
It's Luna.

2752
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:33,410
I'm betting it's Luna.

2753
02:29:35,470 --> 02:29:36,350
Holy fuck.

2754
02:29:37,150 --> 02:29:39,790
We finally got a break in their defenses.

2755
02:29:39,990 --> 02:29:41,310
And y'all niggas don't want to move this shit up.

2756
02:29:46,230 --> 02:29:48,690
Oh my god.

2757
02:29:50,950 --> 02:29:52,950
Holy shit.

2758
02:29:53,530 --> 02:29:56,230
These people are not happy.

2759
02:30:02,610 --> 02:30:06,230
Bro, I am trying my best to keep you up right now.

2760
02:30:10,530 --> 02:30:12,230
Oh my god.

2761
02:30:27,670 --> 02:30:30,150
Don't talk shit in chat, guys.

2762
02:30:30,310 --> 02:30:31,790
This is like one of those moments.

2763
02:30:32,130 --> 02:30:35,890
If you talk shit in chat, it'll fucking bite you in the ass.

2764
02:30:36,330 --> 02:30:39,250
It's like, I talk shit on stream because they're not watching.

2765
02:30:43,210 --> 02:30:46,350
Karma's always gonna get you if you talk shit in chat.

2766
02:30:50,310 --> 02:30:51,110
That's crazy.

2767
02:30:51,730 --> 02:30:52,850
Holy fuck.

2768
02:30:53,930 --> 02:30:55,610
Oh my god.

2769
02:30:56,130 --> 02:30:58,990
That's why you don't talk shit in chat.

2770
02:30:59,530 --> 02:31:01,310
That's why I don't talk too.

2771
02:31:01,830 --> 02:31:04,950
It's like, at this time, on my alt account, I'm like, fuck that.

2772
02:31:07,770 --> 02:31:15,630
Yeah, the moment you do it, you're inviting that in for people to just dogpile you.

2773
02:31:15,790 --> 02:31:17,110
There's no...

2774
02:31:17,110 --> 02:31:19,130
Yeah, you don't speak.

2775
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:25,830
I don't know why you would ever invite that in.

2776
02:31:30,110 --> 02:31:33,910
Yeah, the risk is like, especially as a...

2777
02:31:34,990 --> 02:31:40,450
DPS player, I can see DPS player talking shit a lot.

2778
02:31:40,830 --> 02:31:43,190
Because it's just the way it is.

2779
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:51,750
But like, when you're a support player, you will get dogpiled so fucking hard as a support player.

2780
02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:57,030
So you try to never start shit unless you know you're on the right side of history.

2781
02:31:58,270 --> 02:32:03,050
You don't start shit unless you know you're on the right side of history.

2782
02:32:03,410 --> 02:32:07,550
Because if you're on the right side, people, your team will support you.

2783
02:32:07,950 --> 02:32:11,950
But like, I knew the problem was not me that time on Rocket.

2784
02:32:12,230 --> 02:32:16,130
I was absolutely not the problem there on Rocket.

2785
02:32:16,810 --> 02:32:17,350
I was...

2786
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:20,850
Wait, I'm pretty sure this person avoided me.

2787
02:32:21,050 --> 02:32:22,130
I don't have to avoid them.

2788
02:32:22,470 --> 02:32:23,630
I don't have to waste my avoid.

2789
02:32:24,110 --> 02:32:24,410
Okay.

2790
02:32:27,070 --> 02:32:27,490
Yeah.

2791
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:28,950
You don't get flayed.

2792
02:32:28,990 --> 02:32:30,170
That's why I didn't say nothing.

2793
02:32:30,430 --> 02:32:31,630
I don't have to...

2794
02:32:32,670 --> 02:32:33,290
You're right.

2795
02:32:33,390 --> 02:32:35,610
I should not risk it.

2796
02:32:35,650 --> 02:32:36,090
You're right.

2797
02:32:36,550 --> 02:32:37,570
I don't want to risk it.

2798
02:32:37,590 --> 02:32:38,330
You're right, guys.

2799
02:32:38,330 --> 02:32:39,990
That's crazy.

2800
02:32:42,110 --> 02:32:44,330
I liked how...

2801
02:32:45,330 --> 02:32:46,750
I have like three slots anyway.

2802
02:32:46,870 --> 02:32:54,330
I liked how there's that support playing me and then my entire team was like, that Rocket was not the problem.

2803
02:32:58,130 --> 02:33:00,550
They were like, it was you.

2804
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:02,550
I was like, yay!

2805
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:04,350
Validation.

2806
02:33:04,790 --> 02:33:05,690
It's not me.

2807
02:33:08,410 --> 02:33:13,450
I got validated the one time I wanted to play Rocket.

2808
02:33:18,330 --> 02:33:20,410
Clearly, nobody did anything.

2809
02:33:20,550 --> 02:33:22,550
I literally just ran up and just started healing.

2810
02:33:25,070 --> 02:33:28,230
I would say I was heal botting as Loki 100%.

2811
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:30,130
I was not...

2812
02:33:30,810 --> 02:33:31,370
Um...

2813
02:33:31,370 --> 02:33:36,450
I was not doing damage as Loki enough, but I was also like playing position a lot.

2814
02:33:36,610 --> 02:33:46,690
Like, I was trying to play where because I was scared I was gonna get picked because there were so many flankers around us that I didn't want to play in a way that I was gonna get killed.

2815
02:33:47,130 --> 02:33:51,110
So I was trying to make sure I'm safe as well because there was that fucking Namor and Bucky.

2816
02:33:51,270 --> 02:33:52,770
Namor and Bucky were running around.

2817
02:33:53,690 --> 02:33:56,670
But like definitely was not... I did not get any kills as Loki.

2818
02:33:56,970 --> 02:33:57,710
I could have.

2819
02:33:57,770 --> 02:33:58,110
I didn't...

2820
02:33:58,110 --> 02:33:59,890
I felt like I didn't do enough damage there for Loki.

2821
02:34:02,190 --> 02:34:02,590
But...

2822
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:04,970
I'm still learning Loki.

2823
02:34:05,130 --> 02:34:08,690
Loki's like the character I haven't yet to figure out.

2824
02:34:08,930 --> 02:34:10,790
I don't know how to play Loki that well yet.

2825
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:14,910
Uh... The legend...

2826
02:34:14,910 --> 02:34:17,750
Why are we losing Luna ult?

2827
02:34:18,530 --> 02:34:20,090
Yeah, that's why I'm playing Loki.

2828
02:34:20,570 --> 02:34:21,730
Because Loki is so strong.

2829
02:34:21,830 --> 02:34:23,830
He's the strongest healer at the moment.

2830
02:34:24,550 --> 02:34:26,750
Loki is currently, um...

2831
02:34:26,750 --> 02:34:29,670
the strongest support current meta.

2832
02:34:30,070 --> 02:34:33,730
And he's the only support I don't know how to play right now.

2833
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:39,680
Um... Because there's like so many like...

2834
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:42,360
There's so many like things you can do on Loki too.

2835
02:34:42,540 --> 02:34:43,300
Like the...

2836
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:44,420
You know, changing positions.

2837
02:34:44,620 --> 02:34:47,180
I think like changing positions really hard too.

2838
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:54,560
And place... I think placing the clones is like incredibly difficult to do in terms of positioning wise.

2839
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:56,800
I'm like, where do I put my clones?

2840
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:58,460
I don't fucking know.

2841
02:34:58,980 --> 02:34:59,780
Where are people?

2842
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:01,660
Where are people at?

2843
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:05,260
That was crazy.

2844
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:07,980
Oh, what the fuck?

2845
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:09,020
Goodbye.

2846
02:35:10,540 --> 02:35:10,820
Bye.

2847
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:12,120
Hello little boy.

2848
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:14,320
That's not fair.

2849
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:15,100
Wait, what the fuck?

2850
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:18,160
That's not fair.

2851
02:35:18,260 --> 02:35:19,040
I got hit already.

2852
02:35:19,100 --> 02:35:20,360
You hit me first!

2853
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:21,720
What the...

2854
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:24,240
Oh wait, it's just... Is this an RP lobby again?

2855
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:27,060
There's a no.

2856
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:29,180
Okay.

2857
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:31,500
He still doesn't know.

2858
02:35:31,560 --> 02:35:32,780
Is this an RP lobby?

2859
02:35:37,580 --> 02:35:38,340
Why?

2860
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:42,900
Why you kept going?

2861
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:44,080
Okay.

2862
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:46,040
Yeah, he started it.

2863
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:47,720
He hit me first.

2864
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:51,460
All lobbies are RP lobbies.

2865
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:53,440
That rocket looks like a roleplay.

2866
02:35:57,160 --> 02:35:57,680
Goodbye.

2867
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:01,300
Maybe like, open your eyes?

2868
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:04,580
It is 4 in the morning.

2869
02:36:04,980 --> 02:36:07,500
5 slash 7 in the morning for Easties.

2870
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:09,760
Oh no, I'm on a PST server.

2871
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:10,540
West Coast server.

2872
02:36:13,240 --> 02:36:16,380
I'm a little... I'm on my... So we're all 4am right now.

2873
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:17,040
Right here.

2874
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:18,520
Who is Don King Kong?

2875
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:20,000
Who is Don King Kong?

2876
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:23,100
Don King Kong is a...

2877
02:36:23,100 --> 02:36:23,820
Oh wait.

2878
02:36:27,320 --> 02:36:28,280
That's sad.

2879
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:34,260
Why you running?

2880
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:35,440
Why you running?

2881
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:36,040
Huh?

2882
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:40,680
Oh, that's cute.

2883
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:42,780
That's cute, buddy.

2884
02:36:43,540 --> 02:36:44,580
That's so cute.

2885
02:36:44,700 --> 02:36:50,580
Oh, I got bad RNG.

2886
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:51,780
I got bad RNG.

2887
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,780
I did not want to solo out him.

2888
02:36:57,800 --> 02:36:58,480
Disappear.

2889
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:02,360
Disappear.

2890
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:07,520
Get baited.

2891
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:10,100
Baited.

2892
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:11,220
That's sad.

2893
02:37:11,780 --> 02:37:13,100
I mean, at least he was...

2894
02:37:14,780 --> 02:37:15,740
He was confident.

2895
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:22,520
That guy is definitely not a bot.

2896
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:24,600
He really wanted me dead.

2897
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:30,040
He really wanted me to fucking die.

2898
02:37:30,520 --> 02:37:31,280
Holy shit.

2899
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:32,540
Wait, do we have an Iron Fist?

2900
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:33,540
We have an Iron Fist.

2901
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:35,360
I want the C.

2902
02:37:36,180 --> 02:37:39,180
I never get a chance to play with the C move a lot.

2903
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:41,720
Rare Luna moment.

2904
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:45,740
I say as I practically play Luna as much as I can.

2905
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:48,360
On my main.

2906
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:50,440
Playing Luna on my main.

2907
02:37:51,140 --> 02:37:52,120
Rare Luna moment.

2908
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:55,340
Oh, thank god.

2909
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:56,240
They actually want to...

2910
02:37:57,620 --> 02:37:58,420
Is your C good?

2911
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:02,440
It's okay.

2912
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:04,660
I just don't get to use it a lot.

2913
02:38:04,740 --> 02:38:10,640
I keep forgetting to use it, so I'm trying to take as much opportunity to actually use the C move.

2914
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:14,340
So I can have it ingrained in my head.

2915
02:38:15,340 --> 02:38:16,660
Because I always forget.

2916
02:38:18,540 --> 02:38:20,240
So what draws you to be a support mate?

2917
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:22,320
My lack of DPS skill.

2918
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:28,020
And the fact that I'm not a masochist to play a tank.

2919
02:38:30,460 --> 02:38:31,940
I'm gonna say the truth.

2920
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:40,860
I can practice as hard as I could on DPS, but I know my ceiling when it comes to playing DPS.

2921
02:38:46,970 --> 02:38:52,270
I don't think I could be good enough to be a DPS player in eternity.

2922
02:38:56,870 --> 02:38:59,370
Siren and thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2923
02:38:59,470 --> 02:39:00,530
Thank you, thank you.

2924
02:39:01,550 --> 02:39:02,630
But I'm a tank mate.

2925
02:39:03,790 --> 02:39:05,170
Congratulations, you hate yourself.

2926
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:11,270
So this is the C move.

2927
02:39:11,730 --> 02:39:11,910
Boom!

2928
02:39:12,750 --> 02:39:17,630
I always forget to use it, so I try to take an opportunity to use it when I remember to.

2929
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:27,780
Let's go!

2930
02:39:31,140 --> 02:39:31,940
Let's go!

2931
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:33,440
Nice, okay.

2932
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:38,460
Please, I'm only playing Luna because I want to use the C.

2933
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:39,300
Sheet, man.

2934
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:40,900
I've been killing every game.

2935
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:45,940
Unless you want my drafting play, that's all I got.

2936
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:48,840
Welcome to our rank!

2937
02:39:49,080 --> 02:39:50,260
You want to be a DPS player?

2938
02:39:50,380 --> 02:39:52,220
You gotta do it with a support mate.

2939
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:55,240
Oh, shit.

2940
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:03,780
Wait,

2941
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:07,660
what?

2942
02:40:08,160 --> 02:40:09,340
What do you mean by two?

2943
02:40:10,860 --> 02:40:12,140
Wait, we're running Cloak?

2944
02:40:12,180 --> 02:40:12,440
Okay.

2945
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:14,040
That's five.

2946
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:20,680
Oh, I love it when I know there's another flanker here.

2947
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:23,380
That's gonna be behind me any second now.

2948
02:40:24,620 --> 02:40:25,520
We heal each other.

2949
02:40:25,620 --> 02:40:26,740
We keep each other alive.

2950
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:28,240
What?

2951
02:40:29,100 --> 02:40:31,960
Oh my god, I got the fucking random Psylocke.

2952
02:40:33,800 --> 02:40:36,440
He like stood in front of my shot.

2953
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:39,360
I was like, where did this guy come from?

2954
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:44,980
Psylocke literally stood in front of my shot.

2955
02:40:46,460 --> 02:40:47,440
It's like, peek-a-boo.

2956
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:48,880
It's fine.

2957
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:49,700
Guys, don't worry.

2958
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:50,240
I have C.

2959
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:53,800
If I get flanked, I have the game move.

2960
02:40:58,700 --> 02:41:00,460
Please, look behind me.

2961
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:03,440
Oh my god, he got booped up.

2962
02:41:07,020 --> 02:41:07,560
Nice.

2963
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:11,660
Nice cool bubble.

2964
02:41:20,240 --> 02:41:21,020
My team.

2965
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:24,820
Nice.

2966
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:28,940
Woah!

2967
02:41:32,620 --> 02:41:34,360
I don't have another C.

2968
02:41:35,180 --> 02:41:37,200
Oh, why did he cloak up?

2969
02:41:37,220 --> 02:41:38,660
He could've tanked it!

2970
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:53,340
Never cloak a Psylocke ult because it is um, it fucks over the other players.

2971
02:41:54,360 --> 02:42:00,040
You can still die, because there were three of us, we could've all tanked it together.

2972
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:02,660
We could've tanked the...

2973
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:05,660
Don't worry, I got the C move.

2974
02:42:06,620 --> 02:42:08,900
I remember to use it this time.

2975
02:42:12,260 --> 02:42:13,660
Oh, he fucked it up.

2976
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:15,880
Don't worry, I healed us!

2977
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:17,520
I wasted it though.

2978
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:18,900
Okay, I should not have used it.

2979
02:42:18,900 --> 02:42:21,880
I should not have used it.

2980
02:42:22,580 --> 02:42:24,700
Oh, I'm still not alive.

2981
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:27,760
I should not have used it there.

2982
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:34,480
I wanted to save our Bucky, but I forgot to always use it for myself.

2983
02:42:36,710 --> 02:42:40,120
Who cares about what my fucking Bucky needed.

2984
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:41,400
Alright.

2985
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:45,540
Only care about my life.

2986
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:47,620
Alright, guys.

2987
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:53,940
Alright, thing is not surviving at all.

2988
02:42:55,720 --> 02:42:56,440
Absolutely.

2989
02:42:58,820 --> 02:42:59,260
Okay.

2990
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:03,880
I don't know where that fucking bomb's gonna go, so...

2991
02:43:03,880 --> 02:43:04,240
WOAH!

2992
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:07,420
Oh, wow!

2993
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:09,640
What?

2994
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:10,820
Oh my god, the ult!

2995
02:43:11,420 --> 02:43:12,640
I'm so unlucky!

2996
02:43:12,940 --> 02:43:16,000
The ult came down the moment- Okay, it's fine.

2997
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:16,960
It's fine.

2998
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:18,120
He's gonna get that, right?

2999
02:43:18,300 --> 02:43:20,440
He's gonna keep getting that, right?

3000
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:22,080
No, my C!

3001
02:43:22,940 --> 02:43:24,820
Don't worry, I'm coming back, guys.

3002
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:26,500
Don't worry.

3003
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:29,540
Is this winnable?

3004
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:31,420
You and I!

3005
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:32,040
You and me!

3006
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:33,300
Let's go!

3007
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:34,440
Oh my god.

3008
02:43:34,900 --> 02:43:35,560
You and me!

3009
02:43:36,740 --> 02:43:37,900
Okay, nevermind.

3010
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:39,460
Goodbye, Wolverine.

3011
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:41,120
Goodbye.

3012
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:47,280
Goodbye.

3013
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:50,980
Goodbye.

3014
02:43:50,980 --> 02:43:52,660
I just don't think we should run...

3015
02:43:52,660 --> 02:43:53,240
I don't know.

3016
02:43:56,480 --> 02:43:56,840
Goodbye.

3017
02:43:58,480 --> 02:44:02,060
I think we should run Sue for this, just cause like...

3018
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:07,580
Just cause of the fact that- You guys gotta just walk to us, man, when you're getting dove instead of being back.

3019
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:10,540
I was.

3020
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:12,460
I was playing up front with you guys.

3021
02:44:12,860 --> 02:44:14,060
I was up front, wasn't I?

3022
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:14,800
I don't remember.

3023
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:16,200
I don't think I died.

3024
02:44:16,220 --> 02:44:17,560
I never died by flankers.

3025
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:19,000
No!

3026
02:44:19,380 --> 02:44:20,340
What's the point?

3027
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:24,300
What if I just play Sue?

3028
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:27,480
I play Sue for him.

3029
02:44:28,260 --> 02:44:29,560
I can push him back.

3030
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:33,660
Yeah, I died to the Psylocke once and it was the ult.

3031
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:34,580
I was like, what?

3032
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:37,120
I was not getting fucked over by flankers.

3033
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:38,380
At all.

3034
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:41,280
I was having a grand old time, not gonna lie.

3035
02:44:42,980 --> 02:44:45,080
Oh, I don't think he plays Sue, that's why.

3036
02:44:45,620 --> 02:44:46,920
Also, thank you for the raid!

3037
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:48,260
I really appreciate it.

3038
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:49,000
Hello, everybody!

3039
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:50,240
For those who don't know me.

3040
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:53,020
Also, thank you for the raid, Yuku and Ara.

3041
02:44:53,880 --> 02:44:55,700
Those who don't know me, my name is DokiBird.

3042
02:44:55,760 --> 02:45:00,060
I usually stream on YouTube, but I'm on Twitch right now to get my Marble Rivals hours up.

3043
02:45:01,440 --> 02:45:03,820
For my Marble Rivals partnership.

3044
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:06,600
Yeah, you should check me out on YouTube.

3045
02:45:06,740 --> 02:45:07,640
You like my content.

3046
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:10,820
And then also, buy my merch.

3047
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:17,200
I think the best way to support a streamer is merch and...

3048
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:20,820
I think like, merches.

3049
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:29,020
Merch and views.

3050
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:29,780
Aww.

3051
02:45:29,780 --> 02:45:31,200
What?

3052
02:45:35,490 --> 02:45:36,660
Is he okay?

3053
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:40,520
Okay.

3054
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:44,860
They let him walk up to me!

3055
02:45:45,360 --> 02:45:46,340
Holy shit!

3056
02:45:46,820 --> 02:45:48,280
I even pushed him away!

3057
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:51,040
What?!

3058
02:45:51,780 --> 02:45:53,420
Pushed him away!

3059
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:56,560
Y'all can go Loki or something.

3060
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:57,580
Loki?

3061
02:45:58,340 --> 02:45:58,660
What?

3062
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:01,560
Loki is banned!

3063
02:46:04,280 --> 02:46:05,900
I would if I could.

3064
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:08,020
I wanna learn Loki.

3065
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:10,260
Doesn't know.

3066
02:46:14,890 --> 02:46:17,550
I'm gonna save my push on the flankers at this point.

3067
02:46:23,070 --> 02:46:23,990
Okay.

3068
02:46:25,270 --> 02:46:26,110
Okay.

3069
02:46:26,790 --> 02:46:27,630
Okay.

3070
02:46:28,610 --> 02:46:29,450
Alright!

3071
02:46:29,930 --> 02:46:30,930
Let's see if I live!

3072
02:46:31,470 --> 02:46:31,790
Aww!

3073
02:46:36,730 --> 02:46:38,630
He doesn't know.

3074
02:46:41,630 --> 02:46:42,930
Okay, now he knows.

3075
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:44,590
Now he knows.

3076
02:46:48,150 --> 02:46:49,870
We can't play Loki.

3077
02:46:50,870 --> 02:46:51,550
Why?

3078
02:46:51,730 --> 02:46:52,550
Why did we ban Namor?

3079
02:46:53,530 --> 02:46:55,950
Because Namor is a fucking terrible play against.

3080
02:46:56,470 --> 02:46:58,610
Because we have Iron Fist.

3081
02:46:59,410 --> 02:47:00,410
What the fuck?

3082
02:47:01,930 --> 02:47:02,930
We had flank...

3083
02:47:02,930 --> 02:47:04,670
We had flanker players.

3084
02:47:05,050 --> 02:47:06,590
The fuck does he mean?

3085
02:47:07,770 --> 02:47:08,750
There we go.

3086
02:47:10,690 --> 02:47:12,230
Okay, I should ult first.

3087
02:47:14,010 --> 02:47:14,690
Alright.

3088
02:47:14,690 --> 02:47:15,210
Alright.

3089
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:18,310
I used pull.

3090
02:47:18,590 --> 02:47:19,190
Nevermind.

3091
02:47:21,650 --> 02:47:22,250
Nevermind.

3092
02:47:23,210 --> 02:47:27,190
Never use pull and push for my team.

3093
02:47:29,830 --> 02:47:31,110
I'm coming back.

3094
02:47:31,210 --> 02:47:31,650
Don't worry.

3095
02:47:31,850 --> 02:47:32,930
They don't know where I am.

3096
02:47:33,930 --> 02:47:35,490
They won't know where I am.

3097
02:47:41,350 --> 02:47:42,250
Don't worry.

3098
02:47:42,490 --> 02:47:44,650
There is...

3099
02:47:49,010 --> 02:47:49,950
Goodbye.

3100
02:47:50,230 --> 02:47:50,950
Nevermind.

3101
02:47:51,130 --> 02:47:51,430
Worry.

3102
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:53,730
Nevermind.

3103
02:47:54,590 --> 02:47:55,210
Worry.

3104
02:47:56,030 --> 02:47:58,750
I literally showed up and it was over.

3105
02:47:59,350 --> 02:48:03,290
It was fucking over.

3106
02:48:04,790 --> 02:48:06,650
I mean...

3107
02:48:07,450 --> 02:48:11,370
Guys, I don't think I like the C move anymore.

3108
02:48:11,370 --> 02:48:12,130
I...

3109
02:48:16,510 --> 02:48:18,090
Nice try everybody.

3110
02:48:18,430 --> 02:48:19,130
Nice try.

3111
02:48:19,250 --> 02:48:21,150
I think I went to Celestial for that.

3112
02:48:21,250 --> 02:48:21,630
It's alright.

3113
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:22,690
It's an ult account.

3114
02:48:23,030 --> 02:48:24,510
That's why I was like...

3115
02:48:24,510 --> 02:48:26,630
What account do I play at 4 in the morning?

3116
02:48:31,090 --> 02:48:31,510
Ouch.

3117
02:48:32,850 --> 02:48:33,650
I can get it back.

3118
02:48:33,830 --> 02:48:34,410
It's fine.

3119
02:48:35,070 --> 02:48:37,610
This account has fucking went through worse.

3120
02:48:40,050 --> 02:48:41,790
How many ult accounts do I have?

3121
02:48:41,910 --> 02:48:45,310
I only have one... Well, I had one Eternity ult account.

3122
02:48:45,970 --> 02:48:47,930
Now I have one main account.

3123
02:48:48,670 --> 02:48:51,530
And that's 200 points at the moment.

3124
02:48:52,850 --> 02:48:54,050
And then...

3125
02:48:54,050 --> 02:48:57,310
I don't even play that often anymore though because I'm so busy with other stuff.

3126
02:48:59,110 --> 02:49:02,010
I just play for stream now.

3127
02:49:05,190 --> 02:49:07,710
And I have this account.

3128
02:49:08,090 --> 02:49:09,430
I have two Celestial accounts now.

3129
02:49:10,370 --> 02:49:12,390
And... No, this is my ult account.

3130
02:49:12,890 --> 02:49:14,390
That's why it's not Doki Bird.

3131
02:49:16,050 --> 02:49:17,570
It's not Doki Bird.

3132
02:49:17,970 --> 02:49:18,370
It's alright.

3133
02:49:18,950 --> 02:49:21,910
Games at this time is not about winning at the morning.

3134
02:49:22,370 --> 02:49:32,430
Games at this time is about meeting the most interesting people who are playing at this time as their hobby.

3135
02:49:35,730 --> 02:49:39,230
Games at this time is whoever's...

3136
02:49:39,230 --> 02:49:48,290
For me, I'm playing at this time because this is the only time I can play for my quota hours because it's literally my job.

3137
02:49:48,670 --> 02:49:56,710
So people who play at this time that's just for out of their own free will is very interesting.

3138
02:50:00,190 --> 02:50:02,610
XD See?

3139
02:50:03,070 --> 02:50:05,870
Yeah, the demons come out at 4 in the morning.

3140
02:50:07,130 --> 02:50:07,650
100%.

3141
02:50:08,570 --> 02:50:11,030
I'm watching the demons right now.

3142
02:50:12,010 --> 02:50:13,270
Creatures of the night.

3143
02:50:13,550 --> 02:50:16,130
They are still gaming at this time.

3144
02:50:19,970 --> 02:50:21,050
Well, I'm on this account.

3145
02:50:21,150 --> 02:50:22,050
It's only 25.

3146
02:50:22,850 --> 02:50:23,750
The hell spawns.

3147
02:50:23,870 --> 02:50:25,650
What's the worst rank session I've had?

3148
02:50:25,730 --> 02:50:29,010
When I played for 13 hours and I just went up one game.

3149
02:50:29,770 --> 02:50:31,750
That was very rough.

3150
02:50:32,490 --> 02:50:37,350
That was incredibly rough.

3151
02:50:39,090 --> 02:50:43,330
I know I have to censor this for sure.

3152
02:50:43,770 --> 02:50:45,990
For that one crash on our Luna.

3153
02:50:46,650 --> 02:50:49,230
I definitely have to censor it.

3154
02:50:49,850 --> 02:50:56,970
That guy was not having a good day.

3155
02:50:56,970 --> 02:51:00,770
Oh, this guy is already not having a good day.

3156
02:51:03,910 --> 02:51:06,510
Time to warm up.

3157
02:51:07,970 --> 02:51:09,410
This is an RP server.

3158
02:51:09,650 --> 02:51:10,230
Goddamn.

3159
02:51:10,730 --> 02:51:11,170
Wait, no.

3160
02:51:11,610 --> 02:51:11,910
Wait, no.

3161
02:51:11,950 --> 02:51:12,530
They're just bad.

3162
02:51:19,320 --> 02:51:21,440
I was like, wait, are they roleplaying?

3163
02:51:21,580 --> 02:51:23,880
No, they're literally missing every fucking shot.

3164
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:26,800
XD Holy shit.

3165
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,540
The fucking Panther.

3166
02:51:30,360 --> 02:51:31,780
Oh my God.

3167
02:51:33,460 --> 02:51:35,140
That was...

3168
02:51:35,140 --> 02:51:36,380
That's crazy.

3169
02:51:36,800 --> 02:51:40,760
The fucking Panther was crazy to watch.

3170
02:51:41,380 --> 02:51:43,680
I legitimately just thought they were just roleplaying.

3171
02:51:44,460 --> 02:51:45,660
But they were just bad.

3172
02:51:48,700 --> 02:51:49,420
Okay, are you?

3173
02:51:49,560 --> 02:51:50,100
Okay, no.

3174
02:51:50,240 --> 02:51:50,720
You're real.

3175
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:52,380
You're real.

3176
02:51:53,400 --> 02:51:58,160
XD You're definitely...

3177
02:51:58,900 --> 02:51:59,540
Mine.

3178
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:02,320
XD

3179
02:52:09,850 --> 02:52:11,050
That's interesting.

3180
02:52:13,510 --> 02:52:15,450
Haven't been in Celestia in a while.

3181
02:52:16,710 --> 02:52:17,390
That's a lie.

3182
02:52:17,570 --> 02:52:19,290
I had to rank up this account to eternity.

3183
02:52:26,870 --> 02:52:31,870
Not purposely, but I actually ranked up this account to eternity just for stream's sake.

3184
02:52:32,110 --> 02:52:33,570
And now it's back in Celestia.

3185
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:34,450
Sad.

3186
02:52:36,850 --> 02:52:37,930
So sad.

3187
02:52:43,990 --> 02:52:44,530
Alas.

3188
02:52:44,870 --> 02:52:46,930
I ranked it up just for a stream.

3189
02:52:47,470 --> 02:52:48,270
Maybe I can...

3190
02:52:48,270 --> 02:52:49,370
Okay, maybe if I try.

3191
02:52:49,590 --> 02:52:49,830
Alright.

3192
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:52,270
No, trying is for...

3193
02:52:52,270 --> 02:52:53,050
Trying... Oh.

3194
02:53:00,510 --> 02:53:02,790
Alright, trying is not an option anymore.

3195
02:53:03,290 --> 02:53:06,290
Trying is not an option anymore.

3196
02:53:06,670 --> 02:53:08,470
It hurts less, guys.

3197
02:53:08,850 --> 02:53:13,170
It hurts less if I take it less seriously, which is what I've noticed.

3198
02:53:14,550 --> 02:53:15,730
It's trying is...

3199
02:53:17,050 --> 02:53:18,310
It hurts...

3200
02:53:18,310 --> 02:53:20,550
It makes me feel a little less sad.

3201
02:53:25,570 --> 02:53:26,950
Wait, what?

3202
02:53:27,470 --> 02:53:29,010
Who banned or owned it?

3203
02:53:29,010 --> 02:53:29,470
What?

3204
02:53:32,170 --> 02:53:32,810
Someone...

3205
02:53:32,810 --> 02:53:36,030
Someone banned their own champ?

3206
02:53:36,210 --> 02:53:38,270
Oh, that's crazy.

3207
02:53:39,810 --> 02:53:40,450
Oh,

3208
02:53:45,070 --> 02:53:46,410
they got a shark main.

3209
02:53:46,510 --> 02:53:46,810
Okay.

3210
02:53:47,170 --> 02:53:47,610
No wonder.

3211
02:53:47,790 --> 02:53:49,990
Okay, I was gonna be like, oh my god.

3212
02:53:51,170 --> 02:53:52,110
That's why.

3213
02:53:52,350 --> 02:53:52,690
Okay.

3214
02:53:52,950 --> 02:53:54,090
I was gonna say.

3215
02:53:54,470 --> 02:53:55,910
That's insane.

3216
02:53:56,370 --> 02:53:57,670
They actually... Okay.

3217
02:53:58,750 --> 02:53:59,710
Where do I play Loki?

3218
02:53:59,710 --> 02:54:01,310
Alright, guys.

3219
02:54:02,850 --> 02:54:03,450
Let's do Loki.

3220
02:54:03,970 --> 02:54:06,090
I feel Loki today.

3221
02:54:07,330 --> 02:54:08,190
Might as well learn.

3222
02:54:08,530 --> 02:54:09,530
Like, there's no point.

3223
02:54:09,910 --> 02:54:12,970
I play Luna so much in my main.

3224
02:54:13,590 --> 02:54:14,470
I wanna learn Loki.

3225
02:54:18,230 --> 02:54:19,890
I actually wanna learn this character.

3226
02:54:26,010 --> 02:54:27,030
Oh, I forgot.

3227
02:54:27,190 --> 02:54:31,630
I wish I could gift like currency to my other accounts.

3228
02:54:32,430 --> 02:54:33,870
Because I have so much currency.

3229
02:54:33,870 --> 02:54:39,610
Free currency that I got from the sponsor and the tournament.

3230
02:54:41,470 --> 02:54:42,950
From tournaments and stuff.

3231
02:54:44,210 --> 02:54:46,950
So, but I can't gift it to... I wish I can.

3232
02:54:47,070 --> 02:54:54,230
I feel like if you can start gifting stuff on the moment they start doing gifts and stuff, they're gonna make so much money.

3233
02:54:54,950 --> 02:54:56,750
I don't know how people play Loki on this map.

3234
02:54:57,210 --> 02:54:58,070
We'll figure it out.

3235
02:54:58,790 --> 02:54:59,450
I don't know.

3236
02:54:59,610 --> 02:55:01,610
Maybe they don't know.

3237
02:55:03,870 --> 02:55:04,210
I don't know.

3238
02:55:04,290 --> 02:55:05,090
I put it too far.

3239
02:55:05,710 --> 02:55:07,390
I definitely put it too far up.

3240
02:55:08,190 --> 02:55:10,470
I don't think it's gonna do anything.

3241
02:55:11,610 --> 02:55:13,030
Yeah, it's definitely not gonna do much.

3242
02:55:13,950 --> 02:55:15,350
What the fuck already?

3243
02:55:16,730 --> 02:55:19,830
Hahahahaha Where's my team?

3244
02:55:22,630 --> 02:55:25,350
I was like where's the rest of my team?

3245
02:55:27,710 --> 02:55:31,970
Look, I am trying my best right now, okay?

3246
02:55:33,870 --> 02:55:35,630
I have three of me shooting at one guy.

3247
02:55:36,090 --> 02:55:37,770
I think my computer is about to crash.

3248
02:55:38,910 --> 02:55:46,430
Taaaaa Hahahaha Hahahaha Guys, don't you love hearing that?

3249
02:55:48,030 --> 02:55:48,510
Woo.

3250
02:55:48,750 --> 02:55:49,770
I love it.

3251
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:52,310
Hahahaha

3252
02:55:56,660 --> 02:55:58,320
I love to hear that.

3253
02:56:01,580 --> 02:56:07,860
When they're like, guys, my computer Oh, I wanted to press F.

3254
02:56:08,140 --> 02:56:08,740
That was unlucky.

3255
02:56:20,700 --> 02:56:23,940
Don't worry, I can press shift whenever.

3256
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:26,080
But don't die though.

3257
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:26,160
Oh.

3258
02:56:31,720 --> 02:56:32,400
Okay.

3259
02:56:32,400 --> 02:56:33,600
Okay, um.

3260
02:56:34,380 --> 02:56:35,500
Get over here.

3261
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:39,080
Okay.

3262
02:56:41,580 --> 02:56:43,580
We... we advance with that.

3263
02:56:44,360 --> 02:56:44,960
There we go.

3264
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:47,060
There we go.

3265
02:56:47,880 --> 02:56:49,920
Oh wait, that's not cool.

3266
02:56:51,660 --> 02:56:54,260
That is not cool, but that's okay.

3267
02:56:58,540 --> 02:57:00,600
Don't worry, I believe in you, Hella!

3268
02:57:01,420 --> 02:57:02,820
That's right, Hella!

3269
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:07,020
Don't worry!

3270
02:57:07,420 --> 02:57:08,800
I have this too!

3271
02:57:09,340 --> 02:57:10,420
It's gone, it's gone.

3272
02:57:13,220 --> 02:57:14,200
Nice bubble.

3273
02:57:14,440 --> 02:57:16,100
It was afterwards, but nice bubble.

3274
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:22,000
Don't worry.

3275
02:57:22,420 --> 02:57:23,860
I don't know what I'm doing.

3276
02:57:24,140 --> 02:57:24,740
Don't worry.

3277
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:27,100
I don't know what I'm...

3278
02:57:27,100 --> 02:57:28,720
Don't even let it win.

3279
02:57:30,180 --> 02:57:30,740
Oh!

3280
02:57:31,720 --> 02:57:34,060
Maybe I am a low-key player!

3281
02:57:34,720 --> 02:57:35,760
Look at that!

3282
02:57:37,380 --> 02:57:38,820
Oh my god!

3283
02:57:39,860 --> 02:57:40,800
Don't worry.

3284
02:57:43,820 --> 02:57:45,820
I don't know what I'm doing on low-key.

3285
02:57:46,800 --> 02:57:48,140
But do not be afraid.

3286
02:57:49,240 --> 02:57:50,520
Bro, what is going on?

3287
02:57:50,520 --> 02:57:50,700
What the fuck?

3288
02:57:51,180 --> 02:57:53,500
Your HP goes so low in like one second.

3289
02:57:55,180 --> 02:57:56,220
What the fuck?

3290
02:57:57,100 --> 02:57:58,260
Don't worry, I got you.

3291
02:57:59,380 --> 02:58:00,500
Never worry.

3292
02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:05,460
What I've learned is that I can just do splash damage like this.

3293
02:58:11,580 --> 02:58:12,780
Where's my...

3294
02:58:13,740 --> 02:58:14,340
Woah!

3295
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:15,280
Oh, fuck!

3296
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:19,120
Okay, I did not realize everybody was gonna be dead.

3297
02:58:20,100 --> 02:58:20,700
Oh...

3298
02:58:20,700 --> 02:58:21,520
I...

3299
02:58:22,600 --> 02:58:24,000
How the fuck?

3300
02:58:25,360 --> 02:58:26,300
Okay, look guys.

3301
02:58:26,300 --> 02:58:31,100
How was I supposed to know you were all just gonna die like that?

3302
02:58:33,280 --> 02:58:34,740
What the fuck?

3303
02:58:39,240 --> 02:58:40,700
Can anyone touch?

3304
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:45,020
Oh, okay.

3305
02:58:46,080 --> 02:58:47,420
Wait, okay, wait, wait.

3306
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:47,880
It's possible.

3307
02:58:48,080 --> 02:58:48,640
It's possible.

3308
02:58:48,860 --> 02:58:49,380
It's possible.

3309
02:58:50,580 --> 02:58:51,600
Oh, nice!

3310
02:58:57,540 --> 02:58:59,460
Oh no, not the born again.

3311
02:59:03,180 --> 02:59:04,020
That's fine.

3312
02:59:07,100 --> 02:59:07,520
There we go.

3313
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:08,920
Nice!

3314
02:59:13,370 --> 02:59:13,890
Wait...

3315
02:59:13,890 --> 02:59:15,730
I just shoot on the ground at this point.

3316
02:59:17,290 --> 02:59:18,930
Guys, here's my pro tip.

3317
02:59:19,350 --> 02:59:21,050
If you can't aim as low-key...

3318
02:59:22,630 --> 02:59:26,790
Low-key, left-click heals is splash damage.

3319
02:59:27,030 --> 02:59:28,290
So I just shoot at the floor.

3320
02:59:28,390 --> 02:59:33,170
I just shoot the floor because eventually it heals.

3321
02:59:36,490 --> 02:59:38,110
That's what I love about low-key.

3322
02:59:38,910 --> 02:59:40,130
I don't actually have to aim.

3323
02:59:40,230 --> 02:59:41,210
I just shoot the floor.

3324
02:59:42,350 --> 02:59:43,150
That's true.

3325
02:59:44,530 --> 02:59:46,710
The Atom Rest was literally behind us.

3326
02:59:49,850 --> 02:59:50,450
Yeah.

3327
02:59:50,450 --> 02:59:51,810
Ignore that, bro.

3328
02:59:52,510 --> 02:59:53,470
Slash does more...

3329
02:59:53,470 --> 02:59:55,550
Slash does more healing, funny enough.

3330
02:59:55,610 --> 02:59:56,550
Yeah, that's the best part.

3331
02:59:57,030 --> 02:59:58,810
Why aim when I can just shoot the floor?

3332
03:00:05,810 --> 03:00:08,770
There's only one Torch player I've...

3333
03:00:08,770 --> 03:00:13,290
Oh wait, maybe I could technically play with a human Torch one trick.

3334
03:00:14,610 --> 03:00:16,170
Wait, let me see if he's online.

3335
03:00:17,870 --> 03:00:18,790
He wanted to play...

3336
03:00:18,790 --> 03:00:23,130
I know this guy since Overwatch 1.

3337
03:00:23,370 --> 03:00:26,810
And you guys might... OG Overwatch players might recognize him.

3338
03:00:27,150 --> 03:00:29,430
But his name is Iron.

3339
03:00:29,990 --> 03:00:34,210
And he used to be the Hanzo one trick in EU Overwatch.

3340
03:00:34,950 --> 03:00:40,290
And at one point, he did a series where he tried to prove to people...

3341
03:00:40,290 --> 03:00:44,490
That you can one trick as Mercy without using any voice comms.

3342
03:00:44,810 --> 03:00:46,110
And with just the soundboard.

3343
03:00:46,110 --> 03:00:48,130
And he did an unranked top...

3344
03:00:48,750 --> 03:00:50,870
I don't remember if it was an unranked top 500 Mercy.

3345
03:00:53,090 --> 03:00:54,570
With just the soundboard.

3346
03:00:54,690 --> 03:00:55,310
And he did it.

3347
03:00:55,650 --> 03:00:57,810
I think he did it incredibly fast too.

3348
03:00:58,150 --> 03:01:00,110
But he's basically a...

3349
03:01:01,710 --> 03:01:03,570
He's a Mercy one trick.

3350
03:01:03,890 --> 03:01:04,510
Oh, he's a...

3351
03:01:05,110 --> 03:01:06,070
Not Mercy one trick, sorry.

3352
03:01:06,170 --> 03:01:07,210
He is a...

3353
03:01:08,210 --> 03:01:13,110
He is a Hanzo one trick that proved that you can one trick as Mercy without...

3354
03:01:14,630 --> 03:01:16,130
Without any actual comms.

3355
03:01:18,930 --> 03:01:20,050
It's actually...

3356
03:01:20,050 --> 03:01:22,070
And now he's a Human Torch one trick.

3357
03:01:22,370 --> 03:01:24,850
He just likes to do crazy shit.

3358
03:01:26,610 --> 03:01:29,110
But yeah, you might recognize his name.

3359
03:01:30,930 --> 03:01:32,410
Because his name is Iron.

3360
03:01:38,090 --> 03:01:39,190
Oh, he's portaling.

3361
03:01:39,610 --> 03:01:40,050
Nice.

3362
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:42,350
And he's EU, so he might be awake.

3363
03:01:43,110 --> 03:01:43,270
Hahaha.

3364
03:01:47,990 --> 03:01:48,470
What?

3365
03:01:49,690 --> 03:01:50,910
How did he get across?

3366
03:01:51,390 --> 03:01:52,350
Did he fuck up the portal?

3367
03:01:56,610 --> 03:01:58,770
Stay in my thingy if you wanna be...

3368
03:01:59,710 --> 03:02:00,190
Alive.

3369
03:02:03,330 --> 03:02:05,030
Oh, stay in my thingy.

3370
03:02:06,250 --> 03:02:08,450
Stay in my thingy if you wanna be alive.

3371
03:02:10,610 --> 03:02:12,150
Stay in my thingy.

3372
03:02:12,150 --> 03:02:12,810
Hahaha.

3373
03:02:14,090 --> 03:02:15,650
Did he think that's still me?

3374
03:02:16,230 --> 03:02:17,130
Bro, what?

3375
03:02:17,430 --> 03:02:19,010
Why would I stand still?

3376
03:02:21,370 --> 03:02:24,610
Oh, he was very happy about winning.

3377
03:02:29,010 --> 03:02:30,570
Why did I die?

3378
03:02:30,790 --> 03:02:32,570
I thought I was still there.

3379
03:02:39,680 --> 03:02:41,040
That's crazy.

3380
03:02:42,200 --> 03:02:44,060
That's actually crazy.

3381
03:02:45,100 --> 03:02:46,100
This is the...

3382
03:02:47,400 --> 03:02:50,600
Keep clipping Celestial players, pal.

3383
03:02:51,040 --> 03:02:52,260
Who's the fucking player?

3384
03:02:53,140 --> 03:02:53,660
What?

3385
03:02:55,020 --> 03:02:57,080
Who is he trash talking?

3386
03:02:57,280 --> 03:02:59,180
Is there a streamer on the enemy team?

3387
03:02:59,280 --> 03:03:00,380
Oh my god, guys.

3388
03:03:00,860 --> 03:03:03,280
There might be a streamer on the enemy team.

3389
03:03:03,700 --> 03:03:06,380
Let me see if I'll ask if the...

3390
03:03:06,380 --> 03:03:07,220
If he wants to play.

3391
03:03:07,820 --> 03:03:09,660
I know he like, asked me if I wanna play.

3392
03:03:12,540 --> 03:03:14,760
Are you awake now?

3393
03:03:14,940 --> 03:03:18,280
I'm down to play now since I'm streaming.

3394
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:25,040
Oh no!

3395
03:03:25,720 --> 03:03:27,300
He has a weird stream...

3396
03:03:27,300 --> 03:03:29,180
He has a weird sleeping schedule.

3397
03:03:29,880 --> 03:03:32,680
The time I play EU hours.

3398
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:35,180
This guy has a weird...

3399
03:03:35,180 --> 03:03:37,360
He has an NA sleep schedule.

3400
03:03:37,720 --> 03:03:38,800
Oh my god.

3401
03:03:38,820 --> 03:03:40,520
I didn't read his previous message.

3402
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:42,260
A couple of days anyway.

3403
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:43,260
Alright.

3404
03:03:45,200 --> 03:03:45,780
No!

3405
03:03:48,040 --> 03:03:50,400
I could've played with a fucking...

3406
03:03:50,400 --> 03:03:51,580
Torch one trick.

3407
03:03:52,100 --> 03:03:53,460
In Eternity 200.

3408
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:55,440
Oh, I might be too...

3409
03:03:55,440 --> 03:03:57,240
I know it's like within 200 points.

3410
03:03:57,740 --> 03:03:59,280
Yeah, this guy hit...

3411
03:03:59,280 --> 03:04:03,420
Hit Eternity 200 points with just a human torch.

3412
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:08,120
Oh my god, right?

3413
03:04:08,160 --> 03:04:09,580
Imagine having a weird sleep schedule.

3414
03:04:09,800 --> 03:04:10,420
Couldn't be me.

3415
03:04:11,440 --> 03:04:12,600
Couldn't be me.

3416
03:04:13,020 --> 03:04:15,200
Uh, Galaxy, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

3417
03:04:15,280 --> 03:04:16,120
Thank you, thank you.

3418
03:04:16,420 --> 03:04:19,180
Bucky and Techno, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

3419
03:04:19,380 --> 03:04:20,400
Really appreciate it.

3420
03:04:20,540 --> 03:04:21,060
Just like...

3421
03:04:21,060 --> 03:04:21,300
No.

3422
03:04:22,200 --> 03:04:26,300
I can change my sleep schedule anytime I want, guys.

3423
03:04:27,160 --> 03:04:28,640
Anytime I want.

3424
03:04:31,840 --> 03:04:33,120
It's fixable.

3425
03:04:33,540 --> 03:04:34,240
I swear.

3426
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:38,280
I swear it's fixable.

3427
03:04:44,950 --> 03:04:45,390
Let's see.

3428
03:04:45,910 --> 03:04:46,770
All supports are just...

3429
03:04:46,770 --> 03:04:48,570
Someone's like, there's too much sustain in this game.

3430
03:04:49,090 --> 03:04:50,970
All supports are just really...

3431
03:04:50,970 --> 03:04:52,890
Their ults are just not creative.

3432
03:04:53,910 --> 03:04:56,390
Their ults are not creative for supports.

3433
03:04:56,970 --> 03:04:57,650
That's why.

3434
03:04:58,150 --> 03:04:59,030
I think like...

3435
03:04:59,030 --> 03:05:02,450
If the support ult has more diversity...

3436
03:05:02,450 --> 03:05:03,830
It would be more fun.

3437
03:05:04,670 --> 03:05:05,670
Am I the only one here?

3438
03:05:06,550 --> 03:05:06,710
What?

3439
03:05:07,770 --> 03:05:08,350
No!

3440
03:05:11,330 --> 03:05:11,910
No!

3441
03:05:13,090 --> 03:05:15,290
Okay, I gotta reset the Doom matches.

3442
03:05:17,070 --> 03:05:18,690
Am I gonna be in the same lobby?

3443
03:05:20,590 --> 03:05:21,430
Oh, okay.

3444
03:05:21,790 --> 03:05:22,270
Nevermind.

3445
03:05:23,390 --> 03:05:23,970
Loki ult?

3446
03:05:24,110 --> 03:05:26,910
No, it's Mantis, Luna, and...

3447
03:05:27,450 --> 03:05:27,890
Sue.

3448
03:05:29,650 --> 03:05:30,490
It's just all...

3449
03:05:30,490 --> 03:05:31,410
It does the same thing.

3450
03:05:31,630 --> 03:05:32,110
That's it.

3451
03:05:33,730 --> 03:05:34,950
It all does the same thing.

3452
03:05:36,110 --> 03:05:37,890
So I don't find it that creative.

3453
03:05:40,210 --> 03:05:43,330
It's just the support ult that makes you...

3454
03:05:46,880 --> 03:05:49,460
This makes you too...

3455
03:05:49,460 --> 03:05:51,680
Too vulnerable for stuff.

3456
03:05:51,820 --> 03:05:53,000
Oh, Cloak and Dagger, yeah.

3457
03:05:53,660 --> 03:05:58,020
Cloak and Dagger, Sue, Luna, Mantis all does the same thing as their support ult.

3458
03:05:59,200 --> 03:06:00,100
And it's just...

3459
03:06:00,100 --> 03:06:01,460
That's why there's just so much sustainability.

3460
03:06:02,860 --> 03:06:07,760
If there was more diversity in support ults, then like...

3461
03:06:09,280 --> 03:06:09,720
Uh...

3462
03:06:09,720 --> 03:06:10,580
Then like...

3463
03:06:10,580 --> 03:06:11,500
Then there's...

3464
03:06:11,500 --> 03:06:11,800
Oh.

3465
03:06:12,600 --> 03:06:14,080
Okay, I'm so bad in Groot.

3466
03:06:17,340 --> 03:06:18,840
I'm so bad in Groot.

3467
03:06:19,120 --> 03:06:20,880
Oh yeah, all the people in here watching me.

3468
03:06:21,100 --> 03:06:22,860
I hope you enjoyed the stream, guys.

3469
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,360
If you guys like my content, please check me out on YouTube.

3470
03:06:26,660 --> 03:06:28,260
I usually stream on YouTube.

3471
03:06:33,650 --> 03:06:34,090
Whoa.

3472
03:06:38,470 --> 03:06:39,610
Oh, he's a liar.

3473
03:06:39,830 --> 03:06:41,250
He said he only plays.

3474
03:06:42,710 --> 03:06:44,310
Wait, he's a fucking liar.

3475
03:06:45,610 --> 03:06:48,930
He says I only he- Oh wait, no, this guy only hellos.

3476
03:06:53,220 --> 03:06:53,620
Hmm.

3477
03:06:55,160 --> 03:06:56,120
Well, guys.

3478
03:06:57,580 --> 03:06:59,320
Who- Who do I clone?

3479
03:07:02,940 --> 03:07:06,000
I have to be on Luna duty, apparently.

3480
03:07:06,960 --> 03:07:11,480
Who do I clone?

3481
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:14,200
I clone Jeff.

3482
03:07:19,160 --> 03:07:20,040
Ah!

3483
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:22,580
Oh no, we have toxic teammate?

3484
03:07:24,520 --> 03:07:26,560
I must mute.

3485
03:07:28,680 --> 03:07:31,040
Oh fuck, okay, whatever.

3486
03:07:35,260 --> 03:07:37,940
I'm turbo-trolling on Shark.

3487
03:07:40,420 --> 03:07:42,040
You know what, this actually works.

3488
03:07:43,220 --> 03:07:44,000
You don't do that.

3489
03:07:45,560 --> 03:07:46,700
Let's see.

3490
03:07:51,100 --> 03:07:54,120
This is abusive language to me.

3491
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,560
This language is already abusive.

3492
03:08:00,900 --> 03:08:02,640
It's abusing my elo.

3493
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:14,000
I believe we already- There's no way we already have someone that's gonna throw.

3494
03:08:15,660 --> 03:08:18,300
I mean, we got a human- Wait, we have a human, Torch?

3495
03:08:18,900 --> 03:08:19,980
But you gotta kill, though.

3496
03:08:20,100 --> 03:08:21,180
Can't be throwing, right?

3497
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:22,340
But you gotta kill.

3498
03:08:23,800 --> 03:08:24,820
Right, guys?

3499
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:26,420
Yeah.

3500
03:08:27,400 --> 03:08:30,060
Wait, this is- No, I should just- I forgot.

3501
03:08:30,320 --> 03:08:31,960
Never, never give up hope.

3502
03:08:35,060 --> 03:08:36,480
Never give up hope.

3503
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:39,960
Remember the last time you started hoping, Doki?

3504
03:08:40,200 --> 03:08:41,040
Remember that?

3505
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:41,440
I don't-

3506
03:08:47,140 --> 03:08:49,580
Remember how that was like for you?

3507
03:08:51,320 --> 03:08:52,820
Hope will only disappoint.

3508
03:08:54,580 --> 03:08:55,640
Oh, they have a Hawkeye.

3509
03:08:55,660 --> 03:08:59,900
I don't wanna- I really don't wanna- Holy shit.

3510
03:09:04,380 --> 03:09:06,820
Okay, I legitimately think he needs to stop playing this thing.

3511
03:09:06,900 --> 03:09:08,520
He's actually trolling on that character.

3512
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:13,000
Like, if you're stuck in Celestia and you're playing the thing, it's not the character.

3513
03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:37,260
He's actually- Cause that character- The thing is like one of the easiest- One of the easiest tanks to play right now.

3514
03:09:38,780 --> 03:09:41,280
But you can also not solo tank him.

3515
03:09:42,400 --> 03:09:44,640
It might be easy, but you still can't solo tank.

3516
03:09:46,820 --> 03:09:50,920
I don't wanna use my ult because- Okay, now I can.

3517
03:09:51,340 --> 03:09:52,440
That makes sense to use it.

3518
03:09:57,030 --> 03:09:58,570
You wanna kill our Jett?

3519
03:10:03,470 --> 03:10:05,870
I don't know why you would wanna kill him.

3520
03:10:14,800 --> 03:10:15,540
Okay.

3521
03:10:16,140 --> 03:10:16,880
Okay.

3522
03:10:21,130 --> 03:10:22,630
Did he do it?

3523
03:10:27,700 --> 03:10:28,440
Why?!

3524
03:10:29,300 --> 03:10:30,040
Why?!

3525
03:10:30,040 --> 03:10:30,410
Yes!

3526
03:10:36,300 --> 03:10:37,100
Remember, Jokey.

3527
03:10:37,240 --> 03:10:38,300
Don't- Never hope.

3528
03:10:39,620 --> 03:10:40,360
Never.

3529
03:10:43,720 --> 03:10:46,520
This is what I get for hoping.

3530
03:10:47,020 --> 03:10:49,000
This is what I get.

3531
03:10:52,900 --> 03:10:58,220
That's actually what I get for, like, believing in my team.

3532
03:10:58,360 --> 03:10:59,880
Oh, thank god he swapped off the thing.

3533
03:11:02,020 --> 03:11:04,400
Actually no, I wish he was still on the thing.

3534
03:11:04,660 --> 03:11:05,680
Then we- It'd be easier.

3535
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:12,780
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

3536
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:19,420
Yes, I died too now.

3537
03:11:21,280 --> 03:11:24,140
I did not realize they pushed up that far.

3538
03:11:25,060 --> 03:11:26,540
Silly Jokey.

3539
03:11:26,740 --> 03:11:28,180
You're hoping again.

3540
03:11:29,520 --> 03:11:30,820
So silly.

3541
03:11:33,460 --> 03:11:35,300
Remember what that was like?

3542
03:11:38,890 --> 03:11:40,350
You're so silly.

3543
03:11:43,450 --> 03:11:47,610
I mean, we practically just have a lot of DPS players.

3544
03:11:51,230 --> 03:11:52,030
Okay.

3545
03:11:53,910 --> 03:11:54,750
And a Jeff.

3546
03:11:55,790 --> 03:11:57,030
That's basically it.

3547
03:11:58,930 --> 03:11:59,730
Okay.

3548
03:12:00,370 --> 03:12:01,690
This is where we die.

3549
03:12:08,150 --> 03:12:12,230
We just have- We're like trickling in.

3550
03:12:13,070 --> 03:12:16,450
We're not even playing- Like our Bucky- Why?!

3551
03:12:18,850 --> 03:12:19,650
Why?!

3552
03:12:19,650 --> 03:12:21,210
We're not even playing together.

3553
03:12:24,470 --> 03:12:25,190
Okay.

3554
03:12:27,230 --> 03:12:28,250
See guys?

3555
03:12:28,490 --> 03:12:29,930
This is why I stopped hoping.

3556
03:12:33,330 --> 03:12:34,270
See guys?

3557
03:12:35,390 --> 03:12:36,550
Hope is for losers.

3558
03:12:37,770 --> 03:12:39,710
It's all about the doom cues.

3559
03:12:41,110 --> 03:12:45,030
I like how we win another support and it's not another support ult.

3560
03:12:45,910 --> 03:12:46,630
Like...

3561
03:12:47,210 --> 03:12:48,730
That's my favorite part.

3562
03:12:51,350 --> 03:12:51,910
Okay.

3563
03:12:51,970 --> 03:12:52,470
Okay.

3564
03:12:52,470 --> 03:12:53,150
Let me just stand.

3565
03:12:56,110 --> 03:12:56,670
Shit!

3566
03:12:56,790 --> 03:12:57,090
Okay.

3567
03:12:57,210 --> 03:12:57,650
I'm okay.

3568
03:12:58,050 --> 03:12:58,910
I'm okay.

3569
03:13:00,030 --> 03:13:00,870
I'm okay.

3570
03:13:01,010 --> 03:13:02,070
Where's my mag?

3571
03:13:02,230 --> 03:13:02,530
Okay.

3572
03:13:05,150 --> 03:13:05,990
Oh shit.

3573
03:13:06,110 --> 03:13:06,250
Wait.

3574
03:13:08,830 --> 03:13:09,950
It's okay guys.

3575
03:13:10,050 --> 03:13:13,790
I don't know where he's going but it's- Eat the-

3576
03:13:17,030 --> 03:13:19,950
How did they all not die?!

3577
03:13:22,990 --> 03:13:23,470
Okay.

3578
03:13:24,030 --> 03:13:24,710
That's fine.

3579
03:13:24,870 --> 03:13:25,310
That's fine.

3580
03:13:26,430 --> 03:13:28,030
We can fight this for two more minutes.

3581
03:13:28,830 --> 03:13:29,650
I believe.

3582
03:13:34,560 --> 03:13:35,220
It's okay.

3583
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:35,880
I believe.

3584
03:13:37,060 --> 03:13:37,540
Okay.

3585
03:13:37,600 --> 03:13:40,160
I need to reload so I'm trying to believe- I still believe.

3586
03:13:41,480 --> 03:13:42,040
Oh!

3587
03:13:42,140 --> 03:13:45,260
The Star Lord tried to fly up!

3588
03:13:51,220 --> 03:13:53,880
That- Oh that's not a kill barrier?

3589
03:13:54,180 --> 03:13:54,460
Oh.

3590
03:13:55,580 --> 03:13:56,460
That's why.

3591
03:13:56,580 --> 03:13:56,780
Okay.

3592
03:13:56,860 --> 03:13:58,080
That makes more sense now.

3593
03:13:58,200 --> 03:14:00,620
The shark also thought that was a kill barrier.

3594
03:14:01,280 --> 03:14:03,440
That makes a lot more sense.

3595
03:14:04,820 --> 03:14:05,660
That's funny.

3596
03:14:06,360 --> 03:14:08,240
We both thought the same thing, little guy.

3597
03:14:08,240 --> 03:14:09,120
Alright.

3598
03:14:09,400 --> 03:14:09,740
Aww.

3599
03:14:09,820 --> 03:14:11,800
They're running double tank now?

3600
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:16,060
Maybe we stay up here.

3601
03:14:17,180 --> 03:14:17,760
Nevermind.

3602
03:14:19,020 --> 03:14:19,600
Nevermind.

3603
03:14:19,720 --> 03:14:20,600
They're like- You know what?

3604
03:14:20,680 --> 03:14:22,280
Fuck both of these people.

3605
03:14:22,720 --> 03:14:23,360
In general.

3606
03:14:27,920 --> 03:14:29,580
You know what you're doing wrong?

3607
03:14:29,700 --> 03:14:31,060
You're heal botting too much.

3608
03:14:31,520 --> 03:14:32,580
That was my issue.

3609
03:14:33,780 --> 03:14:34,880
That's basically it.

3610
03:14:35,760 --> 03:14:37,540
A good support, also DPS.

3611
03:14:37,660 --> 03:14:39,480
And that's a thing that I need to do more too.

3612
03:14:43,420 --> 03:14:47,120
Like, you're supposed to balance between healing and DPS.

3613
03:14:48,620 --> 03:14:53,460
Because even when you heal too much, which is why I like- This is like something I need to learn as well.

3614
03:14:54,280 --> 03:14:59,500
If you heal too much, you're giving the enemy team a lot of ults too.

3615
03:15:00,520 --> 03:15:01,520
Oh my god!

3616
03:15:01,540 --> 03:15:02,760
I was so close!

3617
03:15:04,060 --> 03:15:05,060
I'm so sad.

3618
03:15:05,480 --> 03:15:06,300
I'm so sad.

3619
03:15:06,380 --> 03:15:07,760
And I don't get the rez?!

3620
03:15:09,460 --> 03:15:09,900
Aww.

3621
03:15:10,180 --> 03:15:12,000
The fuck, he had to die first.

3622
03:15:12,900 --> 03:15:13,580
Oh, okay.

3623
03:15:13,680 --> 03:15:14,580
We're still winnable.

3624
03:15:17,540 --> 03:15:17,980
Fly!

3625
03:15:19,180 --> 03:15:20,080
Come on, everyone!

3626
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:21,620
Yes!

3627
03:15:23,140 --> 03:15:23,580
There we go.

3628
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:26,000
Too much hope.

3629
03:15:26,520 --> 03:15:28,600
Guys, I don't know if we can push it all the way.

3630
03:15:28,600 --> 03:15:29,640
Yes!

3631
03:15:32,100 --> 03:15:34,120
Oh, if our Bucky can get that kill, maybe?

3632
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:36,160
Nice.

3633
03:15:37,620 --> 03:15:38,820
He's opening a portal.

3634
03:15:39,100 --> 03:15:39,740
Maybe we can...

3635
03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:42,840
No, we can't.

3636
03:15:42,960 --> 03:15:43,600
I need to...

3637
03:15:45,020 --> 03:15:46,620
We need to go back here.

3638
03:15:47,160 --> 03:15:47,820
Come back!

3639
03:15:51,660 --> 03:15:53,000
I'm back, though!

3640
03:15:53,420 --> 03:15:54,420
I'm back!

3641
03:15:54,600 --> 03:15:55,820
I came back!

3642
03:15:56,120 --> 03:15:57,360
I came back!

3643
03:16:01,660 --> 03:16:03,520
I was there!

3644
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:08,380
I came back!

3645
03:16:09,280 --> 03:16:13,580
I don't know about my teammates, but I came back, at least.

3646
03:16:17,220 --> 03:16:19,260
I did it!

3647
03:16:20,020 --> 03:16:21,320
I came back.

3648
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:26,920
Two other people didn't.

3649
03:16:29,040 --> 03:16:30,360
Come back.

3650
03:16:34,990 --> 03:16:36,030
It's okay.

3651
03:16:36,250 --> 03:16:37,650
It is what it is.

3652
03:16:38,710 --> 03:16:40,410
That guy was so sad.

3653
03:16:40,750 --> 03:16:42,470
He was so sad!

3654
03:16:53,730 --> 03:16:54,450
Alright.

3655
03:17:08,690 --> 03:17:11,710
I guess another way to climb in support is just by calming.

3656
03:17:12,630 --> 03:17:16,250
For the support, most supports just have to micro and macro the fucking team.

3657
03:17:16,450 --> 03:17:20,410
I'm not calming because, like, it's 4... it's almost 5 AM.

3658
03:17:22,210 --> 03:17:25,450
5... I don't think there's anything to save 5 AM players.

3659
03:17:26,530 --> 03:17:26,990
You know what I mean?

3660
03:17:26,990 --> 03:17:29,590
I don't think talking is gonna save them.

3661
03:17:30,030 --> 03:17:30,450
I...

3662
03:17:35,250 --> 03:17:36,490
Let's just end it.

3663
03:17:38,310 --> 03:17:39,110
I know.

3664
03:17:43,170 --> 03:17:45,690
If it was, like, primetime, then maybe.

3665
03:17:46,710 --> 03:17:49,110
But, like, this is not primetime at all.

3666
03:17:52,630 --> 03:17:54,630
Oh yeah, that was a mistake from these guys.

3667
03:17:54,730 --> 03:17:57,890
Oh, that was a mis... Wait, they went Panther?!

3668
03:17:58,430 --> 03:17:59,170
Oh, shit.

3669
03:17:59,310 --> 03:18:00,610
Okay, I was not expecting that.

3670
03:18:00,610 --> 03:18:04,590
That Panther pick was very clutch for them.

3671
03:18:08,050 --> 03:18:09,630
Literally, they won because of it.

3672
03:18:09,750 --> 03:18:10,650
We all grouped up.

3673
03:18:12,150 --> 03:18:13,490
I didn't know they were on Panther.

3674
03:18:16,790 --> 03:18:17,750
Froze somebody?!

3675
03:18:17,750 --> 03:18:18,550
Oh, shit.

3676
03:18:18,610 --> 03:18:22,270
I froze their fucking Sue from 20 miles away.

3677
03:18:23,350 --> 03:18:25,750
Trying not to be grouped up.

3678
03:18:27,890 --> 03:18:30,250
Knowing that they have a Panther, I can't be grouped up.

3679
03:18:30,250 --> 03:18:31,970
Because that just gives so many resets.

3680
03:18:34,350 --> 03:18:36,430
The only thing that sucks is that...

3681
03:18:36,430 --> 03:18:38,610
Yeah, see?

3682
03:18:39,130 --> 03:18:40,250
I didn't group up.

3683
03:18:43,150 --> 03:18:44,070
Hey, nice.

3684
03:18:44,750 --> 03:18:45,630
We can go up now.

3685
03:18:47,830 --> 03:18:48,430
Go!

3686
03:18:50,210 --> 03:18:50,530
Yay!

3687
03:18:53,630 --> 03:18:54,230
Disappear!

3688
03:18:55,830 --> 03:18:57,210
Oh, not yet!

3689
03:18:57,210 --> 03:18:58,250
Oh my god!

3690
03:18:58,490 --> 03:19:01,170
Oh my god, he didn't charge it!

3691
03:19:01,690 --> 03:19:02,790
They fucking beat him up.

3692
03:19:02,890 --> 03:19:03,430
Beat him up.

3693
03:19:03,530 --> 03:19:04,110
That's right.

3694
03:19:04,470 --> 03:19:05,730
Fucking beat him up.

3695
03:19:06,090 --> 03:19:07,570
Oh my god.

3696
03:19:07,930 --> 03:19:10,650
He actually... He slam dunked my face.

3697
03:19:10,910 --> 03:19:12,830
I was so dead, but he didn't charge it.

3698
03:19:13,290 --> 03:19:15,270
He did not charge it whatsoever.

3699
03:19:16,210 --> 03:19:17,670
That actually saved me.

3700
03:19:18,670 --> 03:19:19,430
He got impatient.

3701
03:19:21,310 --> 03:19:23,390
He actually got impatient with it.

3702
03:19:26,210 --> 03:19:27,270
Thank god.

3703
03:19:29,970 --> 03:19:30,950
Hello, goodbye.

3704
03:19:32,110 --> 03:19:37,630
Yeah, and then you saw my Magneto bubble at one second after I get fucking dunked on?

3705
03:19:37,870 --> 03:19:38,970
Yeah, I saw that.

3706
03:19:40,530 --> 03:19:43,390
Aww, he fucking dunked it too early too.

3707
03:19:44,710 --> 03:19:48,310
That separates a Magneto player when a Magneto player is like, impatient.

3708
03:19:52,230 --> 03:19:53,290
That's unfortunate.

3709
03:19:55,210 --> 03:19:57,170
You got this.

3710
03:19:57,350 --> 03:19:58,630
You got this, Hawkeye!

3711
03:19:59,150 --> 03:20:01,210
Aww, they're running low-key.

3712
03:20:01,650 --> 03:20:04,110
I wish I could copy actual characters.

3713
03:20:07,790 --> 03:20:08,590
Goodbye.

3714
03:20:09,950 --> 03:20:13,210
I'm predicting where he is by looking at the shadows.

3715
03:20:14,110 --> 03:20:14,770
Look at that.

3716
03:20:16,310 --> 03:20:17,930
I touched everything.

3717
03:20:20,690 --> 03:20:21,970
Jesus Christ.

3718
03:20:23,410 --> 03:20:24,590
Oh, nice.

3719
03:20:25,070 --> 03:20:26,310
Oh, what?!

3720
03:20:27,150 --> 03:20:29,250
The freeze came out!

3721
03:20:29,990 --> 03:20:32,990
Okay, that freeze came out, guys.

3722
03:20:36,130 --> 03:20:37,450
That's actually bullshit.

3723
03:20:38,050 --> 03:20:40,730
The freeze actually came out of my hand.

3724
03:20:40,830 --> 03:20:41,690
I think it's just ping.

3725
03:20:42,250 --> 03:20:45,790
The 70, the actual ping diff hit me there.

3726
03:20:45,790 --> 03:20:46,070
I...

3727
03:20:47,830 --> 03:20:52,090
I literally saw the fucking snowflake comes out.

3728
03:20:52,610 --> 03:20:53,830
And it didn't work.

3729
03:20:54,230 --> 03:20:55,510
I can't believe it.

3730
03:20:56,690 --> 03:20:58,310
I can't fucking believe it.

3731
03:20:59,330 --> 03:21:00,630
Oh my god.

3732
03:21:01,310 --> 03:21:02,330
The world is cruel.

3733
03:21:06,450 --> 03:21:08,410
Hawkeye, please, don't hide from me.

3734
03:21:08,910 --> 03:21:10,390
Oh my...

3735
03:21:10,390 --> 03:21:14,730
Okay, everybody, we all want heals, I know.

3736
03:21:24,110 --> 03:21:24,870
Okay.

3737
03:21:29,270 --> 03:21:32,150
That Magneto really fucking hates me.

3738
03:21:32,790 --> 03:21:34,690
He really does.

3739
03:21:37,130 --> 03:21:39,910
He definitely does not like me at all.

3740
03:21:41,790 --> 03:21:42,450
Good aim.

3741
03:21:43,310 --> 03:21:44,010
He hit a wall.

3742
03:21:44,510 --> 03:21:45,950
It was very interesting to watch.

3743
03:21:51,990 --> 03:21:53,030
Yeah, he...

3744
03:21:53,630 --> 03:21:55,870
He really wanted me dead, that's for sure.

3745
03:21:55,970 --> 03:21:56,870
Oh, that's unfortunate.

3746
03:21:57,890 --> 03:22:00,030
That's very unfortunate for that guy.

3747
03:22:00,910 --> 03:22:04,190
If only I had something to heal for that snowflake.

3748
03:22:11,850 --> 03:22:12,370
Alright.

3749
03:22:14,050 --> 03:22:14,610
Alright.

3750
03:22:16,710 --> 03:22:17,690
Oh, shit!

3751
03:22:17,850 --> 03:22:19,830
Okay, I did not expect him to push up.

3752
03:22:23,770 --> 03:22:24,330
Alright.

3753
03:22:25,850 --> 03:22:26,850
It's fine.

3754
03:22:28,390 --> 03:22:29,430
Things are...

3755
03:22:29,430 --> 03:22:29,670
Oh.

3756
03:22:31,290 --> 03:22:31,850
Oh.

3757
03:22:32,850 --> 03:22:34,470
Oh, people are crashing out.

3758
03:22:34,590 --> 03:22:35,170
It's fine.

3759
03:22:37,250 --> 03:22:38,230
It's fine.

3760
03:22:40,530 --> 03:22:41,090
People...

3761
03:22:41,090 --> 03:22:43,010
Don't you love it when your team's crashing out?

3762
03:22:43,010 --> 03:22:44,290
Love it.

3763
03:22:47,830 --> 03:22:51,070
Some games are literally just GG's by character select.

3764
03:22:53,050 --> 03:22:54,270
Pretty interesting.

3765
03:22:59,890 --> 03:23:00,910
Oh, cool.

3766
03:23:01,210 --> 03:23:02,430
It's fine, he's dead though.

3767
03:23:05,890 --> 03:23:08,370
No, I knew this game was...

3768
03:23:08,370 --> 03:23:08,970
I knew...

3769
03:23:08,970 --> 03:23:11,370
There's a reason why I didn't hope because...

3770
03:23:12,050 --> 03:23:13,370
They were already crashing out...

3771
03:23:15,170 --> 03:23:16,690
On character select.

3772
03:23:16,850 --> 03:23:17,690
So I was like...

3773
03:23:17,690 --> 03:23:19,370
I knew that this team...

3774
03:23:20,770 --> 03:23:21,610
Was not...

3775
03:23:21,890 --> 03:23:23,890
There was no hope for this team.

3776
03:23:23,890 --> 03:23:25,890
And there was no...

3777
03:23:31,550 --> 03:23:34,890
Also thing usually at these hours...

3778
03:23:35,450 --> 03:23:37,330
Is the DPS character...

3779
03:23:37,330 --> 03:23:39,310
DPS players that are...

3780
03:23:39,310 --> 03:23:41,100
That are on at this time.

3781
03:23:41,770 --> 03:23:49,070
There is a surprising abundance of DPS players that crash out at this time.

3782
03:23:51,650 --> 03:23:52,550
Apparently.

3783
03:23:53,890 --> 03:23:54,310
He...

3784
03:23:56,690 --> 03:23:59,150
Is he still trying to...

3785
03:23:59,150 --> 03:24:00,150
Oh, he got me.

3786
03:24:05,870 --> 03:24:07,070
He got me.

3787
03:24:07,290 --> 03:24:08,030
The first...

3788
03:24:08,030 --> 03:24:10,310
The first slam dunk of the day.

3789
03:24:12,490 --> 03:24:14,350
Naiko, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

3790
03:24:14,570 --> 03:24:16,110
Peters, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

3791
03:24:16,250 --> 03:24:17,290
Thank you, thank you.

3792
03:24:18,890 --> 03:24:21,630
That game was 100% rigged from the start.

3793
03:24:21,990 --> 03:24:22,410
That...

3794
03:24:22,410 --> 03:24:24,690
He finally got me.

3795
03:24:25,150 --> 03:24:26,950
Wow, you guys are...

3796
03:24:26,950 --> 03:24:27,590
You got it.

3797
03:24:28,050 --> 03:24:29,090
Alright, who was the worst player?

3798
03:24:29,470 --> 03:24:31,070
Oh yeah, this guy was the first crash out.

3799
03:24:32,350 --> 03:24:34,550
Who was the first crash out?

3800
03:24:35,330 --> 03:24:36,390
This guy, right?

3801
03:24:42,220 --> 03:24:42,780
Alright.

3802
03:24:44,100 --> 03:24:45,820
This guy crashed out first.

3803
03:24:45,940 --> 03:24:47,360
Who was the second crash outer?

3804
03:24:49,900 --> 03:24:50,460
MrBrokenBot.

3805
03:24:51,040 --> 03:24:53,300
Thank you for the five gifted stars.

3806
03:24:53,420 --> 03:24:54,580
Thank you, thank you.

3807
03:24:55,200 --> 03:24:56,940
The comeback guy was...

3808
03:24:56,940 --> 03:24:57,560
Comeback!

3809
03:24:58,200 --> 03:25:00,260
That was a rocket, this guy.

3810
03:25:01,820 --> 03:25:03,020
This guy was funny.

3811
03:25:04,160 --> 03:25:04,680
Comeback!

3812
03:25:05,860 --> 03:25:08,000
Oh, but he was doing really well as...

3813
03:25:11,440 --> 03:25:11,960
As...

3814
03:25:12,600 --> 03:25:13,120
Hawkeye.

3815
03:25:20,360 --> 03:25:22,020
Yeah, he was like...

3816
03:25:23,140 --> 03:25:24,140
He was like...

3817
03:25:25,200 --> 03:25:26,020
Let's see.

3818
03:25:26,760 --> 03:25:27,500
Who was it?

3819
03:25:27,640 --> 03:25:28,500
Who was arguing?

3820
03:25:31,440 --> 03:25:33,240
I wish I know what numbers were.

3821
03:25:33,440 --> 03:25:34,080
What the numbers were.

3822
03:25:34,080 --> 03:25:36,540
No, this guy was the one that says I only had a...

3823
03:25:36,540 --> 03:25:37,680
And then he swapped a group.

3824
03:25:39,860 --> 03:25:41,880
Burrito, thank you for the 300 biddies.

3825
03:25:41,960 --> 03:25:43,040
Thank you, thank you.

3826
03:25:43,140 --> 03:25:44,380
Well, let's know what you did.

3827
03:25:44,460 --> 03:25:45,100
We know you...

3828
03:25:45,100 --> 03:25:46,540
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

3829
03:25:46,800 --> 03:25:47,480
You know what's funny?

3830
03:25:47,580 --> 03:25:49,580
I played Rocket for one...

3831
03:25:49,580 --> 03:25:50,480
For like...

3832
03:25:50,480 --> 03:25:51,400
The first point.

3833
03:25:51,840 --> 03:25:54,020
And then I got instantly flamed.

3834
03:25:54,140 --> 03:25:56,680
And I knew I was not the problem there.

3835
03:26:01,260 --> 03:26:02,140
I was like...

3836
03:26:02,700 --> 03:26:03,500
Just my...

3837
03:26:03,500 --> 03:26:04,900
See, this is what happens.

3838
03:26:05,040 --> 03:26:07,660
Just your presence as Rocket triggers...

3839
03:26:07,660 --> 03:26:10,200
A fucking fight or flight response.

3840
03:26:10,300 --> 03:26:11,920
Because of how hated he is.

3841
03:26:12,280 --> 03:26:12,920
I was like...

3842
03:26:12,920 --> 03:26:13,360
Okay.

3843
03:26:13,800 --> 03:26:15,400
I know Rocket's bad.

3844
03:26:15,900 --> 03:26:17,440
But I did not...

3845
03:26:17,440 --> 03:26:20,380
I played for one point and got...

3846
03:26:20,380 --> 03:26:21,620
And I got yelled at.

3847
03:26:21,960 --> 03:26:23,500
And then the entire team...

3848
03:26:24,100 --> 03:26:24,840
Was like...

3849
03:26:24,840 --> 03:26:27,000
That Rocket was not the problem.

3850
03:26:27,520 --> 03:26:28,960
And then they all...

3851
03:26:28,960 --> 03:26:31,060
Piled on to the Luna player.

3852
03:26:31,180 --> 03:26:32,360
Because the Luna was like...

3853
03:26:32,360 --> 03:26:33,600
This is the Rocket's fault.

3854
03:26:34,040 --> 03:26:36,140
And then my entire team was like...

3855
03:26:36,140 --> 03:26:36,480
Okay.

3856
03:26:36,840 --> 03:26:39,120
That is not the Rocket's fault.

3857
03:26:39,240 --> 03:26:41,640
And they instantly flamed our Luna.

3858
03:26:42,100 --> 03:26:43,240
It was crazy.

3859
03:26:47,940 --> 03:26:50,600
They actually flamed her.

3860
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:51,840
I was like...

3861
03:26:51,840 --> 03:26:53,300
Oh my god.

3862
03:26:56,540 --> 03:26:59,160
I was not ready for that.

3863
03:27:01,480 --> 03:27:03,760
I don't think people know...

3864
03:27:03,760 --> 03:27:05,700
That Rocket is actually...

3865
03:27:05,700 --> 03:27:08,000
Meta in higher elo now.

3866
03:27:08,180 --> 03:27:08,980
Or in competitive.

3867
03:27:10,040 --> 03:27:12,440
People actually play Rocket in competitive.

3868
03:27:12,580 --> 03:27:14,580
Because he's actually really, really good.

3869
03:27:14,900 --> 03:27:16,080
And people don't know that.

3870
03:27:16,240 --> 03:27:17,160
Thank fucking god.

3871
03:27:17,240 --> 03:27:18,140
I'm so happy.

3872
03:27:21,520 --> 03:27:22,820
Only with Punisher?

3873
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:24,080
No, it's not just Punisher.

3874
03:27:24,820 --> 03:27:26,340
It's because of Bucky.

3875
03:27:26,600 --> 03:27:27,640
It's not Punisher.

3876
03:27:28,160 --> 03:27:28,760
It's Bucky.

3877
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:30,840
Because Bucky is so fucking strong now.

3878
03:27:31,100 --> 03:27:31,940
And one above all.

3879
03:27:32,520 --> 03:27:33,640
In the top elo.

3880
03:27:33,840 --> 03:27:36,180
That people actually willingly have to play Rocket.

3881
03:27:36,360 --> 03:27:38,560
And his Rez is just really good now.

3882
03:27:39,180 --> 03:27:41,640
It's his Rez and Bucky team up.

3883
03:27:42,140 --> 03:27:43,960
Because Bucky is such a good character now.

3884
03:27:44,120 --> 03:27:45,720
That in competitive.

3885
03:27:46,060 --> 03:27:46,960
In like esports.

3886
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:48,760
A lot of people run...

3887
03:27:49,840 --> 03:27:50,320
In esports.

3888
03:27:50,320 --> 03:27:50,920
Oh my god.

3889
03:27:50,980 --> 03:27:51,780
Celestia 3.

3890
03:27:51,900 --> 03:27:52,320
Where are you?

3891
03:27:52,560 --> 03:27:53,460
Oh my god.

3892
03:27:53,480 --> 03:27:54,160
I've never...

3893
03:27:57,960 --> 03:27:59,340
Oh my god.

3894
03:27:59,460 --> 03:28:02,300
It's been so long since I've played these lobbies.

3895
03:28:03,780 --> 03:28:04,340
I...

3896
03:28:04,340 --> 03:28:05,200
At these hours?

3897
03:28:05,340 --> 03:28:06,900
What is it gonna be like?

3898
03:28:11,570 --> 03:28:13,450
What is it gonna be like at these...

3899
03:28:13,450 --> 03:28:14,850
At these hours?

3900
03:28:15,710 --> 03:28:17,970
Someone's level 87 Celestia?

3901
03:28:19,690 --> 03:28:20,250
Celestia?

3902
03:28:21,130 --> 03:28:22,770
I wish I could see that.

3903
03:28:26,490 --> 03:28:26,990
I'm banning.

3904
03:28:27,130 --> 03:28:27,330
Oh.

3905
03:28:27,330 --> 03:28:27,630
Oh fuck.

3906
03:28:27,730 --> 03:28:27,970
Sorry.

3907
03:28:28,450 --> 03:28:28,850
Sorry.

3908
03:28:29,030 --> 03:28:30,830
I didn't see you are on Groot.

3909
03:28:32,350 --> 03:28:35,330
I just hate playing against Groot.

3910
03:28:40,310 --> 03:28:40,890
Alright.

3911
03:28:42,170 --> 03:28:43,470
See, I apologize.

3912
03:28:44,050 --> 03:28:45,250
I'm a nice person.

3913
03:28:46,110 --> 03:28:46,270
Alright.

3914
03:28:46,450 --> 03:28:47,270
I'm banning Luna.

3915
03:28:47,270 --> 03:28:47,930
Fuck it.

3916
03:28:53,130 --> 03:28:54,450
Usually is a good time.

3917
03:28:54,590 --> 03:28:55,930
Not 5 in the...

3918
03:28:55,930 --> 03:28:57,390
Not 5 in the morning.

3919
03:29:03,670 --> 03:29:05,030
Hey, bad Loki!

3920
03:29:08,390 --> 03:29:09,570
Life is terrible.

3921
03:29:10,730 --> 03:29:11,890
I guess I'll play Sue.

3922
03:29:12,370 --> 03:29:12,750
I...

3923
03:29:13,710 --> 03:29:14,310
Just...

3924
03:29:15,350 --> 03:29:16,930
Just wanted to play Sue.

3925
03:29:17,170 --> 03:29:18,150
I just wanted to play Loki.

3926
03:29:21,270 --> 03:29:22,730
I just wanted to...

3927
03:29:22,730 --> 03:29:24,170
I can't believe it.

3928
03:29:26,210 --> 03:29:27,950
Why is life so cruel?

3929
03:29:28,930 --> 03:29:29,510
Dang it.

3930
03:29:29,730 --> 03:29:30,010
Okay.

3931
03:29:32,130 --> 03:29:32,930
What's my...

3932
03:29:32,930 --> 03:29:32,950
Record?

3933
03:29:33,350 --> 03:29:35,230
I don't even know what my current record is at the moment.

3934
03:29:35,330 --> 03:29:37,250
I think I'm like win-loss, win-loss, win-loss.

3935
03:29:37,330 --> 03:29:38,130
The fucking cycle.

3936
03:29:44,360 --> 03:29:44,760
Alright.

3937
03:29:45,220 --> 03:29:45,560
Are we...

3938
03:29:45,560 --> 03:29:45,800
Okay.

3939
03:29:46,180 --> 03:29:47,180
Okay, Groot thing.

3940
03:29:47,320 --> 03:29:49,120
Okay, that is...

3941
03:29:49,120 --> 03:29:49,560
Interesting.

3942
03:29:53,960 --> 03:29:54,860
We don't have a...

3943
03:29:54,860 --> 03:29:56,000
We don't have...

3944
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:56,460
Nah.

3945
03:29:56,780 --> 03:29:57,700
Nah, there's no point.

3946
03:29:57,900 --> 03:29:59,600
I might as well play Sue for this.

3947
03:30:00,220 --> 03:30:01,040
There's no point.

3948
03:30:02,560 --> 03:30:05,420
At least we get variety in this ELO.

3949
03:30:06,600 --> 03:30:10,200
You have to watch the 30th time I play Duna.

3950
03:30:11,020 --> 03:30:12,940
I'm actually playing other characters.

3951
03:30:15,700 --> 03:30:16,300
Variety.

3952
03:30:16,480 --> 03:30:17,040
And support.

3953
03:30:18,020 --> 03:30:19,600
And if you were like...

3954
03:30:19,600 --> 03:30:20,760
Support is support.

3955
03:30:24,120 --> 03:30:25,320
What variety?

3956
03:30:26,080 --> 03:30:27,220
You heal.

3957
03:30:28,020 --> 03:30:30,320
Look, this is as much variety as you can get.

3958
03:30:33,180 --> 03:30:36,000
There are other characters besides...

3959
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:38,400
I know, it's actually crazy.

3960
03:30:40,680 --> 03:30:42,260
The support variety.

3961
03:30:47,740 --> 03:30:48,420
Alright.

3962
03:30:49,220 --> 03:30:53,220
We should not be playing this support lineup for...

3963
03:30:53,220 --> 03:30:55,280
Oh, I didn't pull them in.

3964
03:30:55,800 --> 03:30:56,720
He shielded that.

3965
03:30:56,940 --> 03:30:57,540
That was unlucky.

3966
03:31:01,840 --> 03:31:03,000
Oh, I don't have pull.

3967
03:31:03,580 --> 03:31:05,680
I spammed my thing too much there.

3968
03:31:07,840 --> 03:31:08,980
We can kill him, right?

3969
03:31:09,440 --> 03:31:10,160
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3970
03:31:10,240 --> 03:31:11,380
There's no way we don't kill him.

3971
03:31:12,040 --> 03:31:12,620
There we go.

3972
03:31:12,880 --> 03:31:13,640
Get back in here.

3973
03:31:13,720 --> 03:31:14,600
Get back in here!

3974
03:31:15,060 --> 03:31:16,300
Get your ass in here!

3975
03:31:16,900 --> 03:31:17,180
Nice.

3976
03:31:28,120 --> 03:31:30,020
I literally turned around.

3977
03:31:30,440 --> 03:31:31,520
How are we still...

3978
03:31:31,520 --> 03:31:32,760
Okay, I was gonna say.

3979
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:35,880
He went...

3980
03:31:35,880 --> 03:31:37,480
Hey, you did say get back.

3981
03:31:37,580 --> 03:31:38,740
Okay, I...

3982
03:31:38,740 --> 03:31:39,680
It was figuratively.

3983
03:31:39,940 --> 03:31:42,100
I did not mean literally come back.

3984
03:31:42,180 --> 03:31:44,860
I thought it was just a funny haha.

3985
03:31:45,660 --> 03:31:47,500
You ult first, Mantis.

3986
03:31:47,760 --> 03:31:49,840
They don't deserve me talking.

3987
03:31:51,460 --> 03:31:53,440
They don't deserve my vocals.

3988
03:31:54,880 --> 03:31:55,600
Dude.

3989
03:31:58,120 --> 03:32:03,200
Come back in 3-4 hours when it's not Degen hours then maybe.

3990
03:32:05,800 --> 03:32:06,520
Okay.

3991
03:32:07,680 --> 03:32:09,240
I used that jump for no reason.

3992
03:32:10,300 --> 03:32:11,860
Oh shit, I ult first.

3993
03:32:12,300 --> 03:32:12,900
Okay.

3994
03:32:13,480 --> 03:32:14,560
Oh shit.

3995
03:32:15,200 --> 03:32:16,540
Okay, I hope our...

3996
03:32:16,540 --> 03:32:18,420
Oh my god.

3997
03:32:19,420 --> 03:32:20,440
Hahaha.

3998
03:32:22,600 --> 03:32:22,780
Shit.

3999
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:24,000
Hahaha.

4000
03:32:26,260 --> 03:32:27,870
Maybe we can...

4001
03:32:27,960 --> 03:32:28,910
Our fucking...

4002
03:32:29,020 --> 03:32:31,080
Okay, he did not care.

4003
03:32:32,160 --> 03:32:32,740
Hahaha.

4004
03:32:35,360 --> 03:32:36,520
He...

4005
03:32:36,520 --> 03:32:37,550
Our fucking...

4006
03:32:41,420 --> 03:32:44,680
Jesus Christ, this fucking guy is actually...

4007
03:32:45,850 --> 03:32:46,670
annoying.

4008
03:32:47,370 --> 03:32:49,770
Doesn't help that...

4009
03:32:50,810 --> 03:32:51,730
There we go.

4010
03:32:52,490 --> 03:32:53,570
Wait, what the fuck?

4011
03:32:54,490 --> 03:32:55,450
Oh shit.

4012
03:32:56,030 --> 03:32:56,470
Please guys.

4013
03:32:56,690 --> 03:32:58,210
Please, do not let me die.

4014
03:32:58,370 --> 03:32:59,090
I swear to god.

4015
03:32:59,970 --> 03:33:00,450
Okay.

4016
03:33:01,150 --> 03:33:02,490
I used my own thing.

4017
03:33:03,150 --> 03:33:05,130
Omega, thank you for 10 gifted souls.

4018
03:33:05,270 --> 03:33:06,330
Thank you, thank you.

4019
03:33:07,430 --> 03:33:08,250
Okay, nice.

4020
03:33:08,550 --> 03:33:10,130
Oh wait, our Mantis got...

4021
03:33:10,130 --> 03:33:11,210
Okay, they can still touch.

4022
03:33:11,270 --> 03:33:11,770
Oh fuck.

4023
03:33:12,010 --> 03:33:12,670
Oh shit.

4024
03:33:13,070 --> 03:33:13,910
Don't stand still.

4025
03:33:13,990 --> 03:33:14,670
I see you.

4026
03:33:14,870 --> 03:33:15,850
I see...

4027
03:33:15,850 --> 03:33:17,930
I see you fucking...

4028
03:33:17,930 --> 03:33:18,850
I see...

4029
03:33:18,850 --> 03:33:21,550
I heard Mantis standing still...

4030
03:33:21,550 --> 03:33:23,710
and I had so much fear for him.

4031
03:33:24,370 --> 03:33:26,310
I was like, Mantis dude...

4032
03:33:26,310 --> 03:33:27,550
Hawkeye is coming.

4033
03:33:27,850 --> 03:33:28,850
Hawkeye is coming.

4034
03:33:30,690 --> 03:33:31,830
Don't do it.

4035
03:33:32,310 --> 03:33:33,450
Oh, I didn't get him.

4036
03:33:39,030 --> 03:33:40,950
Don't wanna stand behind my...

4037
03:33:40,950 --> 03:33:41,070
Oh.

4038
03:33:43,910 --> 03:33:45,610
Maybe a little worried.

4039
03:33:46,430 --> 03:33:47,070
Maybe...

4040
03:33:47,990 --> 03:33:48,630
Maybe...

4041
03:33:48,630 --> 03:33:49,650
Yeah, sorry.

4042
03:33:50,130 --> 03:33:53,010
Definitely a little bit of worry right there for him.

4043
03:33:53,430 --> 03:33:54,690
That was my bad.

4044
03:33:55,130 --> 03:33:58,010
I was not aware of what you were...

4045
03:33:58,010 --> 03:33:59,130
of your plans there.

4046
03:34:01,670 --> 03:34:02,750
What the fuck?

4047
03:34:02,890 --> 03:34:03,530
Get this...

4048
03:34:03,530 --> 03:34:05,070
Get this fucker outta here.

4049
03:34:05,870 --> 03:34:06,370
Oh.

4050
03:34:07,250 --> 03:34:08,070
Okay, goodbye.

4051
03:34:09,110 --> 03:34:10,250
Okay, goodbye.

4052
03:34:11,890 --> 03:34:12,730
Good luck.

4053
03:34:15,690 --> 03:34:16,590
Good luck.

4054
03:34:17,430 --> 03:34:18,390
Don't worry, I'll disappear.

4055
03:34:20,850 --> 03:34:21,850
Don't worry.

4056
03:34:23,610 --> 03:34:24,670
We disappear.

4057
03:34:26,390 --> 03:34:27,050
What?

4058
03:34:29,330 --> 03:34:30,690
Where's our cart?

4059
03:34:33,230 --> 03:34:34,410
Oh no!

4060
03:34:35,550 --> 03:34:37,150
I couldn't ult that.

4061
03:34:37,410 --> 03:34:38,450
God damn it.

4062
03:34:40,410 --> 03:34:41,710
I couldn't ult it.

4063
03:34:41,730 --> 03:34:42,550
I'm so sad.

4064
03:34:45,490 --> 03:34:46,090
Dude, where's...

4065
03:34:46,090 --> 03:34:47,050
Yeah, I was like, where's the cart?

4066
03:34:47,050 --> 03:34:50,850
I mean, that was a cool ult, but like, where's the cart?

4067
03:34:51,790 --> 03:34:52,230
It's fine.

4068
03:34:52,290 --> 03:34:53,570
We have Mantis ult here.

4069
03:34:57,620 --> 03:34:59,160
I assume that...

4070
03:34:59,160 --> 03:34:59,940
He's had Mantis ult.

4071
03:35:00,020 --> 03:35:00,180
Okay.

4072
03:35:00,460 --> 03:35:01,440
I'm gonna stay behind this.

4073
03:35:02,080 --> 03:35:02,580
I'll stay...

4074
03:35:02,580 --> 03:35:03,540
I'll put this up there.

4075
03:35:07,780 --> 03:35:08,500
Don't worry.

4076
03:35:08,640 --> 03:35:09,560
We have shit.

4077
03:35:15,090 --> 03:35:15,830
It's fine.

4078
03:35:17,030 --> 03:35:18,430
It's not fine anymore.

4079
03:35:22,360 --> 03:35:22,920
Oh.

4080
03:35:24,800 --> 03:35:27,080
Okay, to be fair, I thought he...

4081
03:35:27,080 --> 03:35:29,540
I thought he ulted something.

4082
03:35:30,060 --> 03:35:30,400
Okay?

4083
03:35:31,740 --> 03:35:32,300
Like...

4084
03:35:32,300 --> 03:35:36,020
You would assume something gets ulted.

4085
03:35:38,900 --> 03:35:39,900
Okay, that's good.

4086
03:35:39,960 --> 03:35:41,040
They wasted the cloak ult.

4087
03:35:41,120 --> 03:35:42,600
There was no reason to use that.

4088
03:35:43,300 --> 03:35:43,880
That's good.

4089
03:35:44,780 --> 03:35:46,300
That's actually really good for us.

4090
03:35:47,380 --> 03:35:48,680
Where did my strange go?

4091
03:35:50,260 --> 03:35:50,920
Okay, wait.

4092
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:51,700
I can...

4093
03:35:51,700 --> 03:35:54,200
I was gonna say I can do something cheeky right now.

4094
03:35:55,340 --> 03:35:55,820
Okay.

4095
03:36:02,580 --> 03:36:03,520
Oh, okay.

4096
03:36:03,620 --> 03:36:04,100
Nevermind.

4097
03:36:09,440 --> 03:36:09,920
Nevermind.

4098
03:36:10,120 --> 03:36:12,420
I wanted to do something cheeky, okay?

4099
03:36:12,680 --> 03:36:14,480
But then everybody's dead.

4100
03:36:14,900 --> 03:36:15,780
We did it, team.

4101
03:36:16,100 --> 03:36:17,040
We did it.

4102
03:36:17,220 --> 03:36:18,400
We were a little too slow.

4103
03:36:19,400 --> 03:36:20,240
But you did nothing.

4104
03:36:20,420 --> 03:36:21,120
We did it.

4105
03:36:21,120 --> 03:36:21,360
Wait.

4106
03:36:23,720 --> 03:36:26,020
Jokey, but you didn't do anything.

4107
03:36:28,860 --> 03:36:30,840
That's why we are a team.

4108
03:36:33,640 --> 03:36:34,820
We did it.

4109
03:36:38,080 --> 03:36:38,680
Look at that.

4110
03:36:39,880 --> 03:36:41,020
We did it.

4111
03:36:48,150 --> 03:36:49,050
It's okay.

4112
03:36:49,210 --> 03:36:50,090
I showed them.

4113
03:36:50,330 --> 03:36:52,310
Guys, look at that wall you can break.

4114
03:36:52,310 --> 03:36:54,910
Okay, but that's a cool tech, okay?

4115
03:36:55,530 --> 03:36:58,950
As a Ms. Woman, I break the wall and then I pull them in.

4116
03:36:59,210 --> 03:37:01,850
My team's just killed everyone before I...

4117
03:37:01,850 --> 03:37:04,750
Like, what can I do when they kill everybody?

4118
03:37:05,030 --> 03:37:05,370
Guys.

4119
03:37:06,010 --> 03:37:07,230
It would've been too...

4120
03:37:07,230 --> 03:37:09,030
It would've been a great tech.

4121
03:37:09,530 --> 03:37:11,370
If my team just wasn't that...

4122
03:37:11,370 --> 03:37:13,190
If my team was not so good.

4123
03:37:16,790 --> 03:37:18,750
My team was just too good.

4124
03:37:18,750 --> 03:37:22,350
I'm so unfortunate that my team was just so good.

4125
03:37:22,810 --> 03:37:23,410
Yes.

4126
03:37:24,250 --> 03:37:26,290
Suffering from success, guys.

4127
03:37:27,210 --> 03:37:28,190
Oh my god.

4128
03:37:28,310 --> 03:37:29,610
It's so unfortunate.

4129
03:37:29,890 --> 03:37:30,810
I can't believe it.

4130
03:37:30,850 --> 03:37:33,090
My team was just too fucking good.

4131
03:37:35,730 --> 03:37:37,190
Team too good.

4132
03:37:37,370 --> 03:37:37,590
Sad.

4133
03:37:38,990 --> 03:37:43,650
Don't you hate it when you have good teammates that you can't show your stream content?

4134
03:37:44,230 --> 03:37:45,510
What's the point?

4135
03:37:51,070 --> 03:37:51,790
God.

4136
03:37:52,090 --> 03:37:53,950
Just the first world problems.

4137
03:37:54,150 --> 03:37:55,810
When you just...

4138
03:37:56,590 --> 03:37:57,310
Oh.

4139
03:38:04,190 --> 03:38:04,650
Lucky.

4140
03:38:07,890 --> 03:38:08,470
Okay.

4141
03:38:10,250 --> 03:38:10,870
Bye.

4142
03:38:13,130 --> 03:38:13,850
Okay.

4143
03:38:16,890 --> 03:38:18,530
I try to pull them a little bit closer.

4144
03:38:19,350 --> 03:38:20,630
Hello, everybody.

4145
03:38:20,630 --> 03:38:21,530
Hello.

4146
03:38:22,490 --> 03:38:23,310
But don't worry.

4147
03:38:24,690 --> 03:38:26,750
That guy is just doing tickle damage right now.

4148
03:38:27,670 --> 03:38:28,550
But don't worry.

4149
03:38:31,690 --> 03:38:32,550
It's fine.

4150
03:38:35,670 --> 03:38:36,810
Don't worry, I'm healing.

4151
03:38:37,690 --> 03:38:40,010
I'm just throwing it in a general direction.

4152
03:38:40,370 --> 03:38:41,670
Oh, I should not have wasted the pull.

4153
03:38:42,670 --> 03:38:44,030
I wasted a pull there.

4154
03:38:44,270 --> 03:38:45,090
Wait, did I break my...

4155
03:38:45,090 --> 03:38:45,910
Is my shield broke?

4156
03:38:46,010 --> 03:38:46,650
Oh, it is.

4157
03:38:48,590 --> 03:38:49,270
Don't worry.

4158
03:38:49,270 --> 03:38:53,470
That rock is gonna break and then people will know I was there.

4159
03:38:54,050 --> 03:38:55,670
Sorry, I meant tree.

4160
03:38:57,170 --> 03:38:58,290
Where's my team?

4161
03:39:00,770 --> 03:39:01,690
There you go.

4162
03:39:01,950 --> 03:39:03,090
What are you gonna do, huh?

4163
03:39:04,370 --> 03:39:05,250
Archer is dead.

4164
03:39:06,970 --> 03:39:07,630
Oh, wait.

4165
03:39:07,690 --> 03:39:08,270
He got rez.

4166
03:39:08,690 --> 03:39:10,110
That's what they're gonna do.

4167
03:39:11,330 --> 03:39:11,850
Shit.

4168
03:39:12,550 --> 03:39:13,170
That was scary.

4169
03:39:16,210 --> 03:39:17,490
Where's our Syla?

4170
03:39:18,910 --> 03:39:20,230
Syla, where are you?

4171
03:39:21,130 --> 03:39:21,610
Syla.

4172
03:39:26,250 --> 03:39:27,330
Where's my team?

4173
03:39:29,290 --> 03:39:30,070
Don't worry.

4174
03:39:31,330 --> 03:39:34,370
Oh, maybe worry a little bit because he definitely has ult.

4175
03:39:36,690 --> 03:39:37,790
I'm waking you up!

4176
03:39:37,910 --> 03:39:38,230
Wake up!

4177
03:39:38,310 --> 03:39:38,630
Wake up!

4178
03:39:38,710 --> 03:39:39,110
Wake up!

4179
03:39:45,910 --> 03:39:46,690
Okay, nice.

4180
03:39:46,810 --> 03:39:47,170
We're good.

4181
03:39:50,110 --> 03:39:51,950
God, Invisible Woman is pretty easy.

4182
03:39:51,950 --> 03:39:53,410
Now that I think about it.

4183
03:39:54,130 --> 03:39:54,790
Don't get hit!

4184
03:39:55,530 --> 03:39:56,630
Don't get hit!

4185
03:39:57,150 --> 03:39:57,890
That grid has ult.

4186
03:40:01,990 --> 03:40:02,850
That's fine.

4187
03:40:03,590 --> 03:40:04,650
I just jumped away.

4188
03:40:07,870 --> 03:40:09,150
Just jump away.

4189
03:40:09,330 --> 03:40:10,110
It's that easy.

4190
03:40:11,970 --> 03:40:12,390
Oh, wait.

4191
03:40:12,470 --> 03:40:12,530
Hey!

4192
03:40:13,150 --> 03:40:14,150
Astrange is back.

4193
03:40:18,580 --> 03:40:19,780
Oh my god.

4194
03:40:20,400 --> 03:40:22,340
Wait, Celestial lobbies are pretty easy.

4195
03:40:23,680 --> 03:40:24,240
Wait.

4196
03:40:24,920 --> 03:40:27,520
Wait, when you have confident teammates, that's crazy.

4197
03:40:30,180 --> 03:40:33,720
These guys don't- This Venom does not know how to play Venom.

4198
03:40:33,800 --> 03:40:36,320
He has to- He needs to stop.

4199
03:40:36,660 --> 03:40:43,700
He- He actually- This Venom does not know how to kill people.

4200
03:40:44,080 --> 03:40:45,720
Like, I have real trauma.

4201
03:40:45,880 --> 03:40:47,380
This guy does not give me trauma.

4202
03:40:48,040 --> 03:40:54,120
I- He does not- I have real trauma from good Venom players.

4203
03:40:54,320 --> 03:40:57,060
This guy is just, like, tickling me right now.

4204
03:40:57,520 --> 03:40:58,540
It's actually crazy.

4205
03:40:59,020 --> 03:41:00,060
He's just a little tickler.

4206
03:41:02,940 --> 03:41:04,520
Yeah, he's just farming ults.

4207
03:41:05,200 --> 03:41:06,780
He's just farming support ults for us.

4208
03:41:06,960 --> 03:41:07,440
You know what?

4209
03:41:08,460 --> 03:41:09,200
Get over here.

4210
03:41:09,620 --> 03:41:10,660
Get over here.

4211
03:41:10,780 --> 03:41:11,440
Get over here.

4212
03:41:11,500 --> 03:41:12,000
That's right.

4213
03:41:12,100 --> 03:41:13,300
Get your ass over here.

4214
03:41:13,380 --> 03:41:14,100
I ain't afraid.

4215
03:41:16,800 --> 03:41:17,220
I'm not.

4216
03:41:17,300 --> 03:41:19,120
I have 275 HP.

4217
03:41:19,260 --> 03:41:21,220
Oh, I'm not afraid of you either.

4218
03:41:21,220 --> 03:41:22,300
Get over here.

4219
03:41:23,240 --> 03:41:24,100
Get over here.

4220
03:41:24,120 --> 03:41:26,820
I hope we double support ult just to kill your ass.

4221
03:41:27,040 --> 03:41:28,020
Oh shit, wait.

4222
03:41:30,740 --> 03:41:31,800
That's okay, right?

4223
03:41:33,380 --> 03:41:33,960
That's my guy.

4224
03:41:34,080 --> 03:41:34,680
Let's go!

4225
03:41:35,980 --> 03:41:36,580
That's right.

4226
03:41:36,860 --> 03:41:37,800
I'm pro-lying this.

4227
03:41:37,840 --> 03:41:38,940
I'll beat your ass up.

4228
03:41:39,680 --> 03:41:40,340
Oh, great.

4229
03:41:40,920 --> 03:41:41,700
Let me help him.

4230
03:41:42,480 --> 03:41:42,940
Don't worry.

4231
03:41:43,020 --> 03:41:43,760
He's just a tickler.

4232
03:41:44,220 --> 03:41:45,180
You'll be fine.

4233
03:41:45,360 --> 03:41:46,120
Oh shit, wait.

4234
03:41:46,200 --> 03:41:46,760
People are dead.

4235
03:41:47,480 --> 03:41:48,400
Wait, people are dead.

4236
03:41:48,680 --> 03:41:50,200
Oh, I wish I had my ult.

4237
03:41:50,200 --> 03:41:51,700
I am so sorry.

4238
03:41:55,420 --> 03:41:56,020
Whoops.

4239
03:41:58,260 --> 03:42:00,200
Oh shit, let's go!

4240
03:42:01,180 --> 03:42:01,940
Oh shit.

4241
03:42:03,720 --> 03:42:04,140
Please.

4242
03:42:07,060 --> 03:42:08,360
Don't keep throwing.

4243
03:42:08,620 --> 03:42:09,200
It's okay.

4244
03:42:09,380 --> 03:42:10,820
My team is just too good.

4245
03:42:15,520 --> 03:42:16,340
It's okay.

4246
03:42:16,400 --> 03:42:17,320
My team did it.

4247
03:42:17,620 --> 03:42:19,280
We goofed around too much.

4248
03:42:19,280 --> 03:42:21,160
I should have saved my ult there.

4249
03:42:21,220 --> 03:42:21,980
But it's okay.

4250
03:42:22,740 --> 03:42:25,460
I knew my team could do it.

4251
03:42:28,950 --> 03:42:29,370
See?

4252
03:42:29,530 --> 03:42:30,430
I told you.

4253
03:42:30,990 --> 03:42:32,170
It's just that easy.

4254
03:42:34,990 --> 03:42:35,850
It's that...

4255
03:42:35,850 --> 03:42:40,370
I don't understand how the Star Lord and the Namor did not kill anybody.

4256
03:42:40,930 --> 03:42:41,150
See?

4257
03:42:41,210 --> 03:42:42,150
This is what I mean.

4258
03:42:42,250 --> 03:42:45,630
This is what I mean when I hate playing against a good group player.

4259
03:42:45,710 --> 03:42:47,570
I get plus 15?!

4260
03:42:48,150 --> 03:42:49,190
Oh my god.

4261
03:42:49,910 --> 03:42:51,390
That game was too easy.

4262
03:42:51,470 --> 03:42:53,450
Okay, I need to avoid the Venom though.

4263
03:42:56,250 --> 03:42:58,530
This person should not quit their day job.

4264
03:43:00,190 --> 03:43:03,250
This person needs to find a new main because that's not it.

4265
03:43:03,350 --> 03:43:05,250
This guy does not know how to actually play Venom.

4266
03:43:05,390 --> 03:43:11,070
I played against Andrew's Venom and like five other fucking Venom mains in high elo.

4267
03:43:11,450 --> 03:43:13,190
And like, I just...

4268
03:43:13,950 --> 03:43:14,870
You suffer.

4269
03:43:15,770 --> 03:43:16,290
You...

4270
03:43:18,070 --> 03:43:19,670
No one has fun.

4271
03:43:20,330 --> 03:43:21,010
No...

4272
03:43:22,490 --> 03:43:23,510
No one...

4273
03:43:23,830 --> 03:43:25,710
No one has fun.

4274
03:43:32,110 --> 03:43:33,190
It's just...

4275
03:43:33,190 --> 03:43:35,370
It's just rough out there.

4276
03:43:35,470 --> 03:43:37,770
And that Venom was like going to Weenie Hut Jr.

4277
03:43:42,490 --> 03:43:45,370
It definitely was just Weenie Hut Jr. Venom.

4278
03:43:48,460 --> 03:43:49,560
Oh, nice.

4279
03:43:56,850 --> 03:43:57,530
Alright.

4280
03:43:57,530 --> 03:44:00,050
Oh, back to eternity lobbies.

4281
03:44:00,290 --> 03:44:01,850
Or half eternity lobbies.

4282
03:44:10,190 --> 03:44:12,630
That guy's mic was so fucked up.

4283
03:44:12,850 --> 03:44:13,090
Alright.

4284
03:44:14,530 --> 03:44:16,130
I ban Gru and I use Bathroom.

4285
03:44:18,510 --> 03:44:19,590
That's my job today.

4286
03:44:20,350 --> 03:44:21,430
I play lowkey.

4287
03:44:22,410 --> 03:44:23,630
I'll practice more.

4288
03:44:28,570 --> 03:44:30,830
My day is done when I ban lowkey.

4289
03:45:19,850 --> 03:45:20,910
I did it!

4290
03:45:20,910 --> 03:45:21,910
I did it!

4291
03:45:21,990 --> 03:45:23,290
I got my Gru ban!

4292
03:45:24,610 --> 03:45:25,890
I did it!

4293
03:45:26,010 --> 03:45:27,450
Oh, we don't have a tank player.

4294
03:45:28,890 --> 03:45:29,370
Oh...

4295
03:45:33,990 --> 03:45:36,110
Guys, it's my eternity game!

4296
03:45:36,230 --> 03:45:36,870
Come on!

4297
03:45:42,270 --> 03:45:44,770
It's my eternity game on my second account!

4298
03:45:45,090 --> 03:45:45,510
Come on!

4299
03:45:45,570 --> 03:45:46,510
I don't care, honestly.

4300
03:45:46,510 --> 03:45:51,150
I think they care more about getting eternity than I do.

4301
03:45:53,130 --> 03:45:55,170
If we lose, we lose.

4302
03:45:59,150 --> 03:46:00,270
I didn't care more.

4303
03:46:00,830 --> 03:46:01,870
I'm just fucking around.

4304
03:46:06,870 --> 03:46:08,410
Okay, I'll do...

4305
03:46:09,070 --> 03:46:11,090
Doing a U ult first.

4306
03:46:12,030 --> 03:46:12,850
There we go.

4307
03:46:13,470 --> 03:46:16,350
Now if they double support ult me, it's not my fault.

4308
03:46:18,370 --> 03:46:19,050
There we go.

4309
03:46:19,150 --> 03:46:21,950
I did my communication of the year.

4310
03:46:22,770 --> 03:46:23,490
Calm of the year.

4311
03:46:23,970 --> 03:46:25,530
You might get yours for a faster.

4312
03:46:26,150 --> 03:46:26,830
But alright.

4313
03:46:29,910 --> 03:46:31,310
I believe in this, Luna.

4314
03:46:33,990 --> 03:46:35,450
Don't worry, I'm learning lowkey.

4315
03:46:35,550 --> 03:46:36,830
I will not get mine first.

4316
03:46:38,590 --> 03:46:40,290
But they don't know that.

4317
03:46:40,670 --> 03:46:46,230
They don't know that.

4318
03:46:47,210 --> 03:46:51,810
I don't think I should give them zero confidence starting the game.

4319
03:46:52,330 --> 03:46:52,870
I don't know.

4320
03:46:53,690 --> 03:46:54,470
It's my team.

4321
03:47:02,070 --> 03:47:03,590
Oh no, there's Hawkeye.

4322
03:47:04,130 --> 03:47:05,790
Try not to look at them.

4323
03:47:08,470 --> 03:47:09,030
Oh no.

4324
03:47:14,430 --> 03:47:15,590
Hey, come down!

4325
03:47:16,610 --> 03:47:17,670
Not like that.

4326
03:47:21,390 --> 03:47:23,190
That's unfortunate for him.

4327
03:47:26,630 --> 03:47:29,770
Please stay on the ground so I can splash damage you.

4328
03:47:29,870 --> 03:47:30,150
Please.

4329
03:47:30,450 --> 03:47:31,390
That's all I want.

4330
03:47:32,090 --> 03:47:34,470
If you stay on the ground, I can use splash damage.

4331
03:47:34,690 --> 03:47:36,570
And then it would be so much easier for me.

4332
03:47:40,480 --> 03:47:40,920
Please.

4333
03:47:41,060 --> 03:47:42,240
I just need splash damage.

4334
03:47:47,100 --> 03:47:48,160
Okay, nice.

4335
03:47:48,480 --> 03:47:50,580
They just let us have that for free?

4336
03:47:51,240 --> 03:48:00,960
What am I- We're- Where is- Am I- They actually- Oh my god.

4337
03:48:03,040 --> 03:48:03,760
These-

4338
03:48:08,960 --> 03:48:10,240
Actual lobbies.

4339
03:48:12,240 --> 03:48:15,720
I don't think like anybody is alive anymore in these lobbies.

4340
03:48:16,540 --> 03:48:18,200
Talking of that.

4341
03:48:20,200 --> 03:48:21,800
Oh, I'm debating- Okay.

4342
03:48:22,200 --> 03:48:25,260
I'll use that so my team can at least back up.

4343
03:48:25,600 --> 03:48:26,280
Aggro it.

4344
03:48:28,420 --> 03:48:30,820
People are definitely not alive during these times.

4345
03:48:32,940 --> 03:48:33,780
Oh shit.

4346
03:48:36,980 --> 03:48:37,580
Okay.

4347
03:48:38,420 --> 03:48:39,040
Hey, nice.

4348
03:48:41,860 --> 03:48:44,440
Where's my- Okay, I got lost!

4349
03:48:44,440 --> 03:48:50,140
I was like- Okay, I'm gonna let this Luna- Okay, our Luna's not healed.

4350
03:48:50,220 --> 03:48:52,020
I was gonna say, I'm gonna let our Luna heal this.

4351
03:48:52,560 --> 03:48:53,400
So he can get his ult.

4352
03:48:56,480 --> 03:48:58,480
I'm lost in the song.

4353
03:49:00,280 --> 03:49:04,040
These Qs are- People who are definitely crashing at hard.

4354
03:49:08,640 --> 03:49:10,500
I refuse to believe this.

4355
03:49:11,840 --> 03:49:13,940
Okay, I'll put this up because- Alright.

4356
03:49:15,340 --> 03:49:18,680
Our Neymar does not look like he's okay right now.

4357
03:49:21,120 --> 03:49:22,380
Alright guys.

4358
03:49:22,840 --> 03:49:23,560
Hey guys.

4359
03:49:24,020 --> 03:49:25,220
You guys okay?

4360
03:49:26,160 --> 03:49:27,300
We dance!

4361
03:49:27,820 --> 03:49:29,720
Cause our Luna fell down now!

4362
03:49:30,780 --> 03:49:31,140
Yippee!

4363
03:49:32,020 --> 03:49:33,760
I run away now!

4364
03:49:34,120 --> 03:49:34,540
Unless!

4365
03:49:35,500 --> 03:49:37,420
Oh, I didn't have shift now!

4366
03:49:38,220 --> 03:49:39,360
I thought I had shift!

4367
03:49:40,800 --> 03:49:43,300
I was looking at my clothes!

4368
03:49:43,300 --> 03:49:44,400
It's okay!

4369
03:49:47,580 --> 03:49:49,500
Sorry, I thought I had shift.

4370
03:49:50,440 --> 03:49:52,560
But I was looking at the wrong cooldown.

4371
03:49:53,140 --> 03:49:54,780
I was looking at my clone cooldown.

4372
03:49:55,380 --> 03:49:57,100
I was like, wait, I have a shift!

4373
03:49:57,520 --> 03:50:00,140
And then for my shift, I was like, one second?

4374
03:50:04,820 --> 03:50:05,640
It's okay.

4375
03:50:06,640 --> 03:50:11,500
I just wanted him to, you know, feel good about himself, guys.

4376
03:50:11,500 --> 03:50:16,680
I just wanted him to feel good, guys.

4377
03:50:16,920 --> 03:50:22,600
Okay, he's having a rough day and I want to make sure he gets at least one kill.

4378
03:50:28,780 --> 03:50:30,300
Quenna, thank you for the one gift.

4379
03:50:30,680 --> 03:50:32,120
Thank you, thank you.

4380
03:50:32,160 --> 03:50:33,020
I appreciate it.

4381
03:50:33,440 --> 03:50:38,860
I bet you I'm gonna get plus 19 and I'll be one point away from- One point away.

4382
03:50:38,980 --> 03:50:41,000
Wait, why is everyone humping Luna?

4383
03:50:41,000 --> 03:50:41,860
What about me?

4384
03:50:41,960 --> 03:50:42,480
I'm Loki.

4385
03:50:42,900 --> 03:50:45,320
I'm Loki played by Tom Hiddleston!

4386
03:50:45,440 --> 03:50:45,960
Come on!

4387
03:50:46,340 --> 03:50:48,060
I'm everybody's dreamboat.

4388
03:50:48,900 --> 03:50:50,100
What happened?

4389
03:50:50,340 --> 03:50:50,860
You know what?

4390
03:50:50,960 --> 03:50:51,440
The Hiddles?

4391
03:50:54,080 --> 03:50:56,220
What about the Hiddleston?

4392
03:50:57,620 --> 03:50:59,420
I'm fucking the Hiddleston!

4393
03:50:59,600 --> 03:51:00,120
I'm British!

4394
03:51:02,060 --> 03:51:05,220
Well, I'm technically not British, but you know.

4395
03:51:06,580 --> 03:51:08,140
I'm Norse, but...

4396
03:51:09,200 --> 03:51:10,420
You know what?

4397
03:51:12,340 --> 03:51:13,080
There we go.

4398
03:51:15,300 --> 03:51:15,860
Wow!

4399
03:51:17,300 --> 03:51:18,940
Good luck, everybody.

4400
03:51:22,620 --> 03:51:23,340
Alright.

4401
03:51:24,600 --> 03:51:25,240
Okay.

4402
03:51:25,780 --> 03:51:27,860
I don't think we're winning this lobby.

4403
03:51:28,560 --> 03:51:30,260
Not winning this fight, for sure.

4404
03:51:31,200 --> 03:51:31,920
Shit.

4405
03:51:33,160 --> 03:51:33,880
Fuck.

4406
03:51:35,660 --> 03:51:36,860
I have to make sure.

4407
03:51:38,920 --> 03:51:41,780
I'd be surprised if...

4408
03:51:41,780 --> 03:51:43,440
Okay, there's three of us now.

4409
03:51:43,960 --> 03:51:45,180
We can make this work.

4410
03:51:45,260 --> 03:51:45,940
There's three of us.

4411
03:51:46,060 --> 03:51:46,500
Oh!

4412
03:51:49,040 --> 03:51:51,620
I thought we could make it work, okay?

4413
03:51:52,320 --> 03:51:53,380
I really...

4414
03:51:54,080 --> 03:51:56,220
I really thought it was possible.

4415
03:51:57,320 --> 03:51:58,360
I'm sorry.

4416
03:51:58,760 --> 03:51:59,700
I'm sorry.

4417
03:51:59,940 --> 03:52:00,660
I leave now.

4418
03:52:00,700 --> 03:52:01,360
Oh, fuck!

4419
03:52:01,420 --> 03:52:01,700
Okay.

4420
03:52:02,420 --> 03:52:03,360
Oh, I'm alive!

4421
03:52:03,860 --> 03:52:04,840
Oh, I'm alive!

4422
03:52:06,440 --> 03:52:08,800
Please get on the ground so I can splash damage you.

4423
03:52:11,740 --> 03:52:12,180
Please...

4424
03:52:12,180 --> 03:52:15,200
Oh my god, I should not have given that Magneto a one.

4425
03:52:16,460 --> 03:52:17,060
I really shouldn't.

4426
03:52:18,560 --> 03:52:19,000
Okay.

4427
03:52:21,840 --> 03:52:22,940
Okay, it was my bad.

4428
03:52:23,020 --> 03:52:25,560
I gave him that one and I think we fucked up with that.

4429
03:52:28,260 --> 03:52:29,140
Okay, guys!

4430
03:52:30,360 --> 03:52:31,340
That's a lot!

4431
03:52:32,520 --> 03:52:34,160
That's a lot of health!

4432
03:52:35,180 --> 03:52:37,620
I don't know if that was worth it!

4433
03:52:38,040 --> 03:52:39,100
It's just two of them.

4434
03:52:39,340 --> 03:52:39,680
I'm fine.

4435
03:52:40,960 --> 03:52:43,420
Oh, it was not just two of them!

4436
03:52:44,640 --> 03:52:47,100
It wasn't just two of them!

4437
03:52:47,800 --> 03:52:48,180
Okay.

4438
03:52:49,360 --> 03:52:49,680
Maybe?

4439
03:52:51,980 --> 03:52:54,660
Guys, it definitely was not just two of them.

4440
03:52:55,160 --> 03:52:56,160
There's more than that.

4441
03:52:56,540 --> 03:52:57,440
Oh, shit!

4442
03:52:58,320 --> 03:52:59,540
Oh my god, okay.

4443
03:53:01,500 --> 03:53:02,660
Oh no, I have to reload.

4444
03:53:03,900 --> 03:53:05,380
I'm so unfortunate!

4445
03:53:08,140 --> 03:53:09,980
That was so unfortunate.

4446
03:53:10,900 --> 03:53:12,000
Oh, man.

4447
03:53:12,200 --> 03:53:14,560
Guys, why did I give their Magneto that one?

4448
03:53:15,080 --> 03:53:16,460
That was a mistake.

4449
03:53:16,660 --> 03:53:16,900
Whoops.

4450
03:53:17,580 --> 03:53:19,500
That was actually a mistake.

4451
03:53:21,080 --> 03:53:22,980
Just the two of them.

4452
03:53:25,920 --> 03:53:27,820
Just the two of them.

4453
03:53:33,240 --> 03:53:34,220
There we go.

4454
03:53:35,540 --> 03:53:37,360
Just the two of them.

4455
03:53:39,680 --> 03:53:41,060
This is where I die, though.

4456
03:53:41,280 --> 03:53:42,640
This is absolutely where I die.

4457
03:53:47,380 --> 03:53:48,500
There it is.

4458
03:53:51,400 --> 03:53:51,960
Alright.

4459
03:53:54,820 --> 03:53:58,120
Maybe I shouldn't play Loki when we had someone that fucking flies.

4460
03:53:58,660 --> 03:53:59,220
Maybe!

4461
03:54:04,700 --> 03:54:05,220
Maybe!

4462
03:54:07,540 --> 03:54:07,980
Alright.

4463
03:54:08,400 --> 03:54:10,900
I gave that man too much confidence, guys.

4464
03:54:11,100 --> 03:54:15,180
I may or may not have fucked that up for us because of that.

4465
03:54:15,520 --> 03:54:18,980
I gave him that one kill and now their team is unstoppable.

4466
03:54:20,580 --> 03:54:21,100
Okay.

4467
03:54:21,860 --> 03:54:22,260
Okay.

4468
03:54:22,540 --> 03:54:25,740
We have to go Luna because we have a Namor.

4469
03:54:27,200 --> 03:54:28,700
We not have a Yeti, but an Adam.

4470
03:54:29,080 --> 03:54:29,380
Okay.

4471
03:54:29,920 --> 03:54:32,220
I want to give it to our Namor if he's a flanking...

4472
03:54:32,220 --> 03:54:34,340
If he's a flanking Namor, then I should go on him.

4473
03:54:34,720 --> 03:54:35,980
But, I don't know.

4474
03:54:36,440 --> 03:54:38,620
Is our Star Lord or a flanking Namor?

4475
03:54:42,760 --> 03:54:43,420
That's true.

4476
03:54:43,500 --> 03:54:45,460
They shouldn't pick something that flies when I pick.

4477
03:54:45,540 --> 03:54:46,300
That is so true.

4478
03:54:46,680 --> 03:54:49,240
Also, like, who was it that was on Storm?

4479
03:54:49,720 --> 03:54:50,980
Who was the Storm player?

4480
03:54:53,260 --> 03:54:55,800
The Storm-Torch combo was not it.

4481
03:54:56,080 --> 03:54:59,520
It was wasting too much... too many ults for, like, one fight.

4482
03:55:01,540 --> 03:55:04,840
Guys, why did I give him that one kill?

4483
03:55:05,620 --> 03:55:06,480
I fucked up.

4484
03:55:06,740 --> 03:55:07,520
Actually, I'm gonna...

4485
03:55:08,600 --> 03:55:10,460
Oh my god, I really want to give it to our Namor.

4486
03:55:15,700 --> 03:55:17,640
I was pocketing...

4487
03:55:17,640 --> 03:55:22,620
The worst part was that I was pocketing the shit out of him too.

4488
03:55:25,660 --> 03:55:27,280
There was, like, nothing.

4489
03:55:27,420 --> 03:55:28,280
There was no way.

4490
03:55:29,520 --> 03:55:33,860
I don't know how else I could, like, clutch this for him.

4491
03:55:34,080 --> 03:55:34,720
Okay, I need heal.

4492
03:55:55,420 --> 03:55:56,880
Oh my god.

4493
03:55:59,520 --> 03:56:00,640
Oh my god.

4494
03:56:07,440 --> 03:56:09,880
I love these so much.

4495
03:56:10,360 --> 03:56:13,680
Welcome to 5AMQs, everybody.

4496
03:56:14,500 --> 03:56:17,880
Truly a very special time on me.

4497
03:56:19,280 --> 03:56:21,400
This is basically every game, I think, at these hours.

4498
03:56:22,580 --> 03:56:26,320
I refuse to believe games are ever normal at these times.

4499
03:56:28,820 --> 03:56:29,980
Oh my god.

4500
03:56:32,480 --> 03:56:38,540
That's why I was like, it's always interesting to see who the players...

4501
03:56:38,540 --> 03:56:40,500
What kind of players play at these times.

4502
03:56:41,260 --> 03:56:42,220
Do I die?

4503
03:56:44,280 --> 03:56:45,320
She doesn't.

4504
03:56:47,820 --> 03:56:48,620
It's alright.

4505
03:56:48,900 --> 03:56:49,840
I saved you.

4506
03:56:49,940 --> 03:56:50,800
I'm a hero.

4507
03:56:51,720 --> 03:56:54,120
I think I might have saved the wrong person.

4508
03:56:54,600 --> 03:56:56,200
Now we don't have a king.

4509
03:56:56,320 --> 03:56:58,320
Oh my god.

4510
03:57:05,000 --> 03:57:06,380
They have strange ults.

4511
03:57:06,880 --> 03:57:10,340
They have strange ults.

4512
03:57:10,540 --> 03:57:10,960
Guys.

4513
03:57:11,960 --> 03:57:12,160
Woo.

4514
03:57:14,320 --> 03:57:16,040
I know, our Lemur is definitely flanker, though.

4515
03:57:21,630 --> 03:57:25,610
It's always interesting to see who the gamers are at these times.

4516
03:57:26,090 --> 03:57:30,930
Because, like, they're doing it out of their own free will, you know?

4517
03:57:30,930 --> 03:57:33,090
So it's like...

4518
03:57:33,910 --> 03:57:39,070
It's like, what is it like for these people to willingly play at these hours?

4519
03:57:41,230 --> 03:57:42,470
What is it like?

4520
03:57:45,650 --> 03:57:47,710
What is that like for them?

4521
03:57:54,050 --> 03:57:54,730
Okay.

4522
03:57:54,730 --> 03:57:54,910
Okay.

4523
03:57:57,510 --> 03:58:02,370
Like, especially with so much hate in your system, too.

4524
03:58:03,190 --> 03:58:05,390
There was so much hate for that guy.

4525
03:58:06,030 --> 03:58:07,830
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna win.

4526
03:58:11,050 --> 03:58:15,450
Guys, I think I fucked up by letting that Mag have that one kill.

4527
03:58:16,590 --> 03:58:19,010
That... that might have been a mistake.

4528
03:58:19,610 --> 03:58:20,150
Maybe.

4529
03:58:20,690 --> 03:58:21,330
That strange ult.

4530
03:58:26,030 --> 03:58:28,330
That strange ult, so we'll see how it goes.

4531
03:58:33,460 --> 03:58:35,800
Okay, that's like...

4532
03:58:35,800 --> 03:58:36,440
Oh shit.

4533
03:58:40,340 --> 03:58:41,040
There we go.

4534
03:58:41,860 --> 03:58:43,140
That was a lot of ults, guys.

4535
03:58:46,860 --> 03:58:49,520
For the fact that we still have to kill this Magneto.

4536
03:58:51,460 --> 03:58:53,000
That was a lot of ults, guys.

4537
03:58:54,720 --> 03:58:55,840
I mean, sure, I'm at 80%.

4538
03:58:58,660 --> 03:59:01,460
Okay, I... I have to go.

4539
03:59:02,160 --> 03:59:04,780
I have to... I don't know, I'm worried for my team.

4540
03:59:05,420 --> 03:59:09,220
I wanna play here, but I'm actually worried for my team.

4541
03:59:18,850 --> 03:59:20,050
Please, please.

4542
03:59:20,870 --> 03:59:22,130
Oh my god!

4543
03:59:23,110 --> 03:59:24,450
That was so close.

4544
03:59:28,030 --> 03:59:29,250
That was so close.

4545
03:59:33,990 --> 03:59:34,310
Okay.

4546
03:59:36,630 --> 03:59:39,250
That's... I just need to keep my tank up.

4547
03:59:40,170 --> 03:59:40,770
Yippee!

4548
03:59:43,330 --> 03:59:43,610
Please.

4549
03:59:45,030 --> 03:59:45,730
Oh, okay.

4550
03:59:49,050 --> 03:59:49,650
Alright.

4551
03:59:54,530 --> 03:59:55,870
We keep each other up?

4552
03:59:55,930 --> 03:59:58,350
If we keep each other up, then maybe?

4553
04:00:01,810 --> 04:00:03,070
Oh, this is...

4554
04:00:06,090 --> 04:00:06,950
Oh, hey!

4555
04:00:07,830 --> 04:00:09,610
Wow, we did it.

4556
04:00:13,350 --> 04:00:14,070
Yay!

4557
04:00:16,330 --> 04:00:17,770
Crash unavoided!

4558
04:00:20,090 --> 04:00:20,810
Yippee!

4559
04:00:21,230 --> 04:00:23,950
Plus 19, I can feel it.

4560
04:00:24,490 --> 04:00:27,750
That match felt like a plus 19... No, guys.

4561
04:00:27,930 --> 04:00:30,230
That felt like a plus 19 game.

4562
04:00:30,950 --> 04:00:31,310
That's...

4563
04:00:33,410 --> 04:00:34,050
That...

4564
04:00:34,050 --> 04:00:37,390
That does not feel like a plus 20.

4565
04:00:44,650 --> 04:00:46,390
I felt it.

4566
04:00:46,830 --> 04:00:50,030
I was like, there's no way this game would just hand it over.

4567
04:00:50,270 --> 04:00:51,730
There's no way.

4568
04:00:52,750 --> 04:00:58,470
There's no way this game would be like, you deserve 20 points after that.

4569
04:00:58,470 --> 04:00:59,110
Yeah!

4570
04:01:01,050 --> 04:01:02,490
Oh, I love that.

4571
04:01:02,590 --> 04:01:03,530
The classic.

4572
04:01:04,250 --> 04:01:05,470
The fucking classic.

4573
04:01:06,750 --> 04:01:07,990
Just one point.

4574
04:01:10,690 --> 04:01:14,030
I'm ready for the minus 29 right there.

4575
04:01:14,390 --> 04:01:15,210
There's final hits.

4576
04:01:16,010 --> 04:01:17,750
I like how he's like, you go, Human Torch.

4577
04:01:17,770 --> 04:01:20,010
He literally has seven final hits.

4578
04:01:20,110 --> 04:01:21,790
He was more like a damage farmer.

4579
04:01:22,770 --> 04:01:25,010
He was farming damage for the team.

4580
04:01:27,130 --> 04:01:28,290
That one death.

4581
04:01:28,910 --> 04:01:31,190
Every death I had, they took away.

4582
04:01:31,650 --> 04:01:33,390
They took it away from me.

4583
04:01:39,620 --> 04:01:42,420
They're like, you had that one death, we're not letting you have fun.

4584
04:01:42,860 --> 04:01:43,900
I was like, okay.

4585
04:01:46,680 --> 04:01:48,580
I guess, fuck me, right?

4586
04:01:55,050 --> 04:01:55,550
Alright.

4587
04:01:56,210 --> 04:01:58,150
Oh shit, that guy's a lowkey main.

4588
04:01:59,050 --> 04:01:59,970
What if I take his...

4589
04:02:04,350 --> 04:02:05,750
No lowkey for you.

4590
04:02:05,890 --> 04:02:06,990
You don't need it.

4591
04:02:07,090 --> 04:02:08,470
I need it for content.

4592
04:02:08,530 --> 04:02:09,670
Where's your content?

4593
04:02:12,830 --> 04:02:14,670
Medi, thank you for the 500 bitties.

4594
04:02:14,790 --> 04:02:16,110
No, we have four support players.

4595
04:02:17,610 --> 04:02:21,930
Can you be that...

4596
04:02:21,930 --> 04:02:24,190
Guys, we have four support players.

4597
04:02:27,870 --> 04:02:29,770
I am not going DPS.

4598
04:02:29,770 --> 04:02:32,350
Guys, for that plus one point.

4599
04:02:34,270 --> 04:02:37,650
As long as they don't ban Adam, it should be fine.

4600
04:02:37,930 --> 04:02:38,790
I can play Adam.

4601
04:02:42,840 --> 04:02:43,740
No, we are not.

4602
04:02:43,980 --> 04:02:48,300
I'm going to make them play tank DPS.

4603
04:02:49,000 --> 04:02:49,880
Fuck this.

4604
04:02:52,580 --> 04:02:53,000
Wait.

4605
04:02:58,060 --> 04:03:00,160
I was like, who are you going to copy?

4606
04:03:01,920 --> 04:03:03,280
Oh man.

4607
04:03:03,720 --> 04:03:06,400
Who the fuck are you going to copy, buddy?

4608
04:03:08,540 --> 04:03:09,700
No way.

4609
04:03:13,230 --> 04:03:13,770
Alright.

4610
04:03:14,190 --> 04:03:15,490
Let me do this.

4611
04:03:18,770 --> 04:03:20,530
Then we have triple rez.

4612
04:03:21,950 --> 04:03:24,210
No lowkey for you.

4613
04:03:25,210 --> 04:03:26,110
Oh, okay.

4614
04:03:27,590 --> 04:03:28,210
Okay.

4615
04:03:28,770 --> 04:03:30,050
We can run this then.

4616
04:03:30,610 --> 04:03:31,570
There we go.

4617
04:03:33,090 --> 04:03:34,510
I was going to be like, you know.

4618
04:03:35,510 --> 04:03:36,910
I am not playing DPS.

4619
04:03:36,910 --> 04:03:37,690
Guys, I am.

4620
04:03:38,310 --> 04:03:41,850
If I'm going to lose, we're not losing.

4621
04:03:44,930 --> 04:03:45,530
Alright.

4622
04:03:48,830 --> 04:03:51,630
Guys, the support players are finally waking up, guys.

4623
04:03:52,010 --> 04:03:55,210
Because it's 8am.

4624
04:03:55,930 --> 04:03:58,690
Apparently, some support players actually have decent schedules.

4625
04:04:01,510 --> 04:04:02,750
Oh my god.

4626
04:04:03,210 --> 04:04:04,690
Support players are waking up now.

4627
04:04:04,810 --> 04:04:06,750
They're support players on the lobby.

4628
04:04:07,570 --> 04:04:08,390
They're healthy and support.

4629
04:04:08,470 --> 04:04:10,610
They get breakfast and they're like, you know what?

4630
04:04:10,890 --> 04:04:12,390
Let me play some...

4631
04:04:12,390 --> 04:04:13,890
How did I miss that?

4632
04:04:15,470 --> 04:04:16,670
Let me play some...

4633
04:04:17,470 --> 04:04:18,950
Some Marble Rivals.

4634
04:04:19,750 --> 04:04:20,810
To start the day off.

4635
04:04:21,750 --> 04:04:22,730
Is that healthy though?

4636
04:04:22,790 --> 04:04:24,690
To start the day off with some Marble Rivals.

4637
04:04:27,750 --> 04:04:31,610
Jesus Christ, everybody is taking so much damage.

4638
04:04:31,770 --> 04:04:33,910
Oh, it's because there's a Hella to my right side.

4639
04:04:34,510 --> 04:04:37,050
Guys, I don't know why we run triple support like this.

4640
04:04:38,050 --> 04:04:38,730
Alright.

4641
04:04:39,810 --> 04:04:40,910
Okay.

4642
04:04:52,540 --> 04:04:54,630
I don't know.

4643
04:05:00,050 --> 04:05:01,150
Let's see.

4644
04:05:01,430 --> 04:05:02,010
Alright.

4645
04:05:03,870 --> 04:05:05,650
Oh, we're running.

4646
04:05:05,650 --> 04:05:07,010
Yeah, but they're...

4647
04:05:07,010 --> 04:05:07,790
They don't have...

4648
04:05:07,790 --> 04:05:08,230
Oh wait.

4649
04:05:08,430 --> 04:05:09,050
This guy's one.

4650
04:05:09,210 --> 04:05:09,470
Come on.

4651
04:05:09,970 --> 04:05:10,750
Come on.

4652
04:05:12,130 --> 04:05:13,190
Let's do this.

4653
04:05:13,450 --> 04:05:15,650
I didn't want to, but...

4654
04:05:16,190 --> 04:05:17,070
I don't have heal.

4655
04:05:17,210 --> 04:05:17,890
Sorry, buddy.

4656
04:05:17,990 --> 04:05:18,970
I thought I...

4657
04:05:18,970 --> 04:05:20,910
I thought I gave you...

4658
04:05:20,910 --> 04:05:22,150
Gave you a support...

4659
04:05:22,150 --> 04:05:23,410
A chain too.

4660
04:05:24,450 --> 04:05:24,930
Yeah.

4661
04:05:25,570 --> 04:05:26,770
I don't know.

4662
04:05:28,950 --> 04:05:31,690
They're running Mantis Starlord because I'm on Adam.

4663
04:05:32,010 --> 04:05:34,630
But like, I don't know about this.

4664
04:05:35,470 --> 04:05:37,410
We're dying to...

4665
04:05:37,410 --> 04:05:37,830
Oh, I forgot.

4666
04:05:38,010 --> 04:05:39,370
That guy's a Hawkeye player too.

4667
04:05:39,690 --> 04:05:41,990
That guy was a pretty decent Hawkeye player.

4668
04:05:42,710 --> 04:05:44,170
Guys, I have Rez.

4669
04:05:48,060 --> 04:05:49,440
I know like...

4670
04:05:49,440 --> 04:05:53,100
The thing is, lower healers don't know how to deal with Hawkeye.

4671
04:05:53,860 --> 04:05:56,960
Because people don't position themselves.

4672
04:05:58,100 --> 04:06:02,180
They like, position themselves in a way that benefits.

4673
04:06:04,980 --> 04:06:06,500
There we go.

4674
04:06:08,760 --> 04:06:09,360
There we go.

4675
04:06:12,760 --> 04:06:13,720
Jesus Christ.

4676
04:06:16,220 --> 04:06:18,800
Oh my god, if I didn't have to reload, I'd kill him.

4677
04:06:19,560 --> 04:06:21,640
I'd actually kill him if I didn't have to reload.

4678
04:06:26,740 --> 04:06:27,220
Yeah.

4679
04:06:29,560 --> 04:06:31,080
I want to play up here.

4680
04:06:31,520 --> 04:06:33,240
But like, I don't know.

4681
04:06:34,120 --> 04:06:36,000
I failed it for the Rez.

4682
04:06:36,020 --> 04:06:36,880
But I don't know.

4683
04:06:37,080 --> 04:06:38,320
I feel like I might die.

4684
04:06:44,040 --> 04:06:45,880
I had to Rez that.

4685
04:06:47,160 --> 04:06:49,560
Just for the fact that...

4686
04:06:49,560 --> 04:06:50,620
Hey, welcome back.

4687
04:06:53,300 --> 04:06:53,860
Guys!

4688
04:06:54,400 --> 04:06:54,960
Really?

4689
04:07:00,140 --> 04:07:00,700
Okay.

4690
04:07:01,640 --> 04:07:02,200
Okay.

4691
04:07:02,860 --> 04:07:03,380
Okay.

4692
04:07:04,280 --> 04:07:09,340
You can tell that I don't get picked by the Hawkeye as much?

4693
04:07:09,880 --> 04:07:12,820
Because like...

4694
04:07:12,820 --> 04:07:15,680
Playing against a Hawkeye is all about positioning.

4695
04:07:15,920 --> 04:07:19,960
If you don't position well enough, you...

4696
04:07:19,960 --> 04:07:21,200
I'm on it.

4697
04:07:21,280 --> 04:07:22,460
I literally spawn on it.

4698
04:07:25,940 --> 04:07:27,480
It's literally positioning.

4699
04:07:27,860 --> 04:07:30,340
I know they have a Hawkeye, so I don't...

4700
04:07:30,340 --> 04:07:34,480
I position myself in a way where I don't get picked easily by Hawkeye.

4701
04:07:34,640 --> 04:07:39,720
And that's why Hawkeye is really, really good against lower ELOs because it's all about punishing positioning.

4702
04:07:41,060 --> 04:07:42,900
And you don't see it in like...

4703
04:07:42,900 --> 04:07:47,780
You don't see it in the higher rank lobbies because it's so easy to punish Hawkeye players.

4704
04:07:48,720 --> 04:07:50,760
Instead of playing Hawkeye, people just play Widow.

4705
04:07:51,980 --> 04:07:54,340
Because Widow is really...

4706
04:07:55,060 --> 04:07:58,380
Widow with a Mantis, with a good Widow player, is really, really good.

4707
04:07:59,000 --> 04:08:02,140
If you can hit headshots, you might as well just play Widow with a Mantis.

4708
04:08:03,580 --> 04:08:04,200
Or Bucky.

4709
04:08:06,560 --> 04:08:08,680
But Hawkeye is literally...

4710
04:08:08,680 --> 04:08:09,940
Oh, that's Mute Q7?

4711
04:08:10,360 --> 04:08:10,800
Uh-oh.

4712
04:08:16,360 --> 04:08:17,360
I don't really want to play.

4713
04:08:17,620 --> 04:08:19,700
Yeah, I'm gonna swap to Loki.

4714
04:08:21,000 --> 04:08:22,120
Not playing it.

4715
04:08:22,420 --> 04:08:24,260
I don't think it's...

4716
04:08:24,260 --> 04:08:25,280
It's not worth it.

4717
04:08:31,180 --> 04:08:33,500
Like, our Mantis is getting picked because of...

4718
04:08:33,500 --> 04:08:35,260
Anyone that gets picked right now...

4719
04:08:35,260 --> 04:08:35,880
Or I could be.

4720
04:08:36,180 --> 04:08:39,300
The Hawkeye is such good at punishing at poor positioning.

4721
04:08:54,610 --> 04:08:58,730
Might have to use that because my team needs heals.

4722
04:09:01,130 --> 04:09:02,290
Oh my god.

4723
04:09:03,630 --> 04:09:05,210
Everybody needs heals!

4724
04:09:07,750 --> 04:09:09,290
Oh my god!

4725
04:09:13,790 --> 04:09:17,850
Oh my god, everybody just needs heals!

4726
04:09:19,530 --> 04:09:19,910
Okay.

4727
04:09:24,750 --> 04:09:26,430
Where is...

4728
04:09:26,430 --> 04:09:27,610
Okay.

4729
04:09:28,310 --> 04:09:29,450
I literally just got it.

4730
04:09:30,170 --> 04:09:31,850
Oh, that's a lie, but...

4731
04:09:35,670 --> 04:09:36,510
Okay.

4732
04:09:38,850 --> 04:09:40,030
Oh no.

4733
04:09:40,290 --> 04:09:40,430
Oh.

4734
04:09:47,510 --> 04:09:48,490
There we go.

4735
04:09:50,370 --> 04:09:52,210
Did we get the point?

4736
04:09:57,990 --> 04:10:00,210
What's the difference between Hawkeye and Widow?

4737
04:10:00,730 --> 04:10:03,110
Widow, like, Mantis...

4738
04:10:03,110 --> 04:10:04,570
Mantis buff.

4739
04:10:04,850 --> 04:10:05,850
Headshots instantly.

4740
04:10:06,430 --> 04:10:07,610
And it's easier to aim.

4741
04:10:11,710 --> 04:10:14,410
Her ult is even better than Hawkeye's ult, too.

4742
04:10:16,730 --> 04:10:16,970
What?

4743
04:10:24,130 --> 04:10:24,590
Spy.

4744
04:10:30,410 --> 04:10:32,290
Just wanted it to be there, so...

4745
04:10:32,930 --> 04:10:33,470
There we go.

4746
04:10:36,070 --> 04:10:36,830
There we go.

4747
04:10:36,990 --> 04:10:37,970
Come on, get him!

4748
04:10:38,130 --> 04:10:38,630
Get him!

4749
04:10:38,630 --> 04:10:39,330
Get him!

4750
04:10:39,690 --> 04:10:40,070
Get him!

4751
04:10:40,170 --> 04:10:40,770
Get him!

4752
04:10:40,870 --> 04:10:44,110
Okay, now I can position my clones, actually.

4753
04:10:44,870 --> 04:10:47,570
I want to position my clones in actual places.

4754
04:10:51,590 --> 04:10:52,250
Okay.

4755
04:10:57,820 --> 04:10:58,840
Oh no.

4756
04:11:00,720 --> 04:11:01,480
Okay, there we go.

4757
04:11:02,020 --> 04:11:03,410
I want to make it...

4758
04:11:04,900 --> 04:11:05,560
Okay!

4759
04:11:06,520 --> 04:11:07,180
Buddy!

4760
04:11:08,140 --> 04:11:09,040
Oh no.

4761
04:11:09,860 --> 04:11:10,420
Oh no.

4762
04:11:17,120 --> 04:11:18,220
Oh my god.

4763
04:11:18,400 --> 04:11:18,740
Please.

4764
04:11:19,700 --> 04:11:20,260
Please.

4765
04:11:22,460 --> 04:11:24,580
I have to fucking...

4766
04:11:24,580 --> 04:11:25,660
I have to, like...

4767
04:11:25,660 --> 04:11:25,740
Oh.

4768
04:11:27,260 --> 04:11:27,820
Woah!

4769
04:11:29,040 --> 04:11:30,220
Come on, I believe in you!

4770
04:11:30,300 --> 04:11:30,500
Hello!

4771
04:11:31,020 --> 04:11:32,160
I believe in you!

4772
04:11:32,360 --> 04:11:32,900
Go, hello!

4773
04:11:33,140 --> 04:11:33,340
Go!

4774
04:11:35,420 --> 04:11:35,980
Okay.

4775
04:11:37,760 --> 04:11:38,320
Alright.

4776
04:11:39,360 --> 04:11:40,920
Woah, Captain America!

4777
04:11:41,180 --> 04:11:42,500
What you doing, buddy?

4778
04:11:47,430 --> 04:11:48,150
Oh!

4779
04:11:49,450 --> 04:11:51,390
That's unfortunate, buddy!

4780
04:11:52,510 --> 04:11:53,410
Yeah, he definitely has clobber.

4781
04:11:55,830 --> 04:11:57,170
Oh shit, okay.

4782
04:11:57,730 --> 04:11:58,210
Let's go.

4783
04:11:59,010 --> 04:12:00,030
I walk over now.

4784
04:12:01,530 --> 04:12:02,590
And then I go there.

4785
04:12:07,590 --> 04:12:08,670
Don't worry!

4786
04:12:09,190 --> 04:12:10,650
I dance!

4787
04:12:12,490 --> 04:12:13,630
Don't worry!

4788
04:12:13,630 --> 04:12:13,770
Don't worry!

4789
04:12:15,610 --> 04:12:16,810
Go do your thing!

4790
04:12:17,610 --> 04:12:17,970
Okay.

4791
04:12:19,310 --> 04:12:20,150
Oh, fuck!

4792
04:12:20,570 --> 04:12:21,290
What?!

4793
04:12:21,290 --> 04:12:23,210
Oh, that's so unlucky!

4794
04:12:24,410 --> 04:12:26,590
I did not realize he was there.

4795
04:12:27,230 --> 04:12:28,470
Oh shit, nice!

4796
04:12:32,210 --> 04:12:33,450
Let's go!

4797
04:12:34,910 --> 04:12:36,010
Let's go!

4798
04:12:36,370 --> 04:12:37,870
I still might die, though.

4799
04:12:38,150 --> 04:12:39,050
It's fine.

4800
04:12:40,410 --> 04:12:40,990
It's okay.

4801
04:12:42,290 --> 04:12:44,590
It's not... it might not be as okay.

4802
04:12:46,590 --> 04:12:47,590
It's not okay.

4803
04:12:47,670 --> 04:12:48,390
I didn't have...

4804
04:12:48,390 --> 04:12:50,670
I couldn't TP to the other clone.

4805
04:12:53,410 --> 04:12:54,210
Oh my...

4806
04:12:54,210 --> 04:12:55,210
It's not over yet!

4807
04:12:55,350 --> 04:12:55,870
I actually...

4808
04:12:55,870 --> 04:12:56,790
My first rez!

4809
04:12:58,990 --> 04:13:00,210
I got the rez off!

4810
04:13:01,010 --> 04:13:02,190
We have one fight left.

4811
04:13:12,110 --> 04:13:13,890
Bro, people play this game...

4812
04:13:13,890 --> 04:13:15,370
Nah, I don't think he'd realize that.

4813
04:13:16,450 --> 04:13:17,730
Oh shit!

4814
04:13:18,450 --> 04:13:20,050
That's unlucky for him.

4815
04:13:21,150 --> 04:13:22,130
It's okay.

4816
04:13:26,430 --> 04:13:27,530
That's my bad.

4817
04:13:27,810 --> 04:13:28,830
That's actually my bad.

4818
04:13:29,470 --> 04:13:31,630
I pressed my shit, but it didn't...

4819
04:13:33,350 --> 04:13:33,670
What?!

4820
04:13:33,990 --> 04:13:36,090
That thing hit his head!

4821
04:13:36,710 --> 04:13:38,410
I was like, where was he?

4822
04:13:39,110 --> 04:13:40,490
I was like, wait, what?

4823
04:13:41,190 --> 04:13:43,390
He shot through the thing!

4824
04:13:43,390 --> 04:13:45,810
I could not see him!

4825
04:13:46,990 --> 04:13:48,810
That was a really good shot.

4826
04:13:52,730 --> 04:13:54,010
That's a really...

4827
04:13:54,010 --> 04:13:56,270
Yeah, he actually shot through the thing too.

4828
04:13:57,010 --> 04:13:58,610
What's going on?

4829
04:14:01,650 --> 04:14:03,110
I was about to press shift.

4830
04:14:04,310 --> 04:14:05,570
That's so rough.

4831
04:14:06,250 --> 04:14:07,670
That's so rough.

4832
04:14:08,170 --> 04:14:09,290
That's actually rough.

4833
04:14:10,450 --> 04:14:11,550
Wait, I'm gonna...

4834
04:14:11,550 --> 04:14:14,150
This guy's a much bigger Loki player, because he's...

4835
04:14:14,150 --> 04:14:15,470
We just didn't have a tank players.

4836
04:14:17,490 --> 04:14:20,990
Um, I should avoid one of the supports, so I don't have that happen again.

4837
04:14:22,290 --> 04:14:22,790
Oh!

4838
04:14:23,370 --> 04:14:25,170
That minus 23!

4839
04:14:25,750 --> 04:14:28,270
I need to be in an eternity game to get 25!

4840
04:14:29,050 --> 04:14:30,970
I've been in too many Celestial games.

4841
04:14:32,890 --> 04:14:33,450
Oh!

4842
04:14:33,930 --> 04:14:34,610
That's rough.

4843
04:14:37,530 --> 04:14:38,530
That's like even rough.

4844
04:14:39,130 --> 04:14:39,330
Why?

4845
04:14:40,250 --> 04:14:41,590
Oh my god.

4846
04:14:42,170 --> 04:14:43,790
What is my luck there?

4847
04:14:46,490 --> 04:14:47,050
Why?

4848
04:14:48,070 --> 04:14:49,810
Why couldn't it give me an actual...

4849
04:14:51,450 --> 04:14:52,490
Why couldn't it...

4850
04:14:52,490 --> 04:14:54,410
I literally just needed plus 20.

4851
04:14:55,170 --> 04:14:56,810
Just like a crumb.

4852
04:14:57,250 --> 04:14:59,670
A fucking crumb.

4853
04:15:00,370 --> 04:15:00,950
I don't...

4854
04:15:00,950 --> 04:15:02,290
I guess I don't deserve it.

4855
04:15:02,770 --> 04:15:03,950
I just don't deserve it.

4856
04:15:03,950 --> 04:15:04,690
I wasn't...

4857
04:15:04,690 --> 04:15:06,070
I didn't beg hard enough.

4858
04:15:10,910 --> 04:15:12,510
I only died to him like twice.

4859
04:15:12,670 --> 04:15:15,550
No, my positioning as that Luna was bad.

4860
04:15:15,690 --> 04:15:16,350
Like I...

4861
04:15:16,350 --> 04:15:19,610
Usually I would never frontline that hard as Luna with the ult.

4862
04:15:20,550 --> 04:15:22,110
But I also thought he was dead.

4863
04:15:22,450 --> 04:15:23,350
I thought...

4864
04:15:23,870 --> 04:15:25,330
I didn't realize he was still alive.

4865
04:15:27,910 --> 04:15:29,990
And in the second one, I literally didn't see...

4866
04:15:29,990 --> 04:15:32,470
I was walking to the point.

4867
04:15:33,710 --> 04:15:37,610
I think if I could press my shift in time, I would have got it.

4868
04:15:37,750 --> 04:15:38,170
That one...

4869
04:15:38,170 --> 04:15:39,690
The second time I died wasn't positioning.

4870
04:15:40,170 --> 04:15:41,450
We literally had to get to point.

4871
04:15:43,390 --> 04:15:44,850
Like there was nothing we could do there.

4872
04:15:45,730 --> 04:15:48,910
Cause it was literally like we had to get to point or we lose it.

4873
04:15:49,490 --> 04:15:51,590
Oh my god, that was so bad from my end.

4874
04:15:52,350 --> 04:15:53,990
That was actually so...

4875
04:15:53,990 --> 04:15:55,050
I was not aiming there.

4876
04:15:55,510 --> 04:15:57,650
He doesn't know where I am though.

4877
04:15:58,250 --> 04:15:58,610
Woah.

4878
04:16:01,350 --> 04:16:03,030
Where am I?

4879
04:16:04,670 --> 04:16:07,130
Oh, what kind of fight are they having up there?

4880
04:16:09,010 --> 04:16:09,970
My kill.

4881
04:16:10,250 --> 04:16:10,510
Yoink.

4882
04:16:11,930 --> 04:16:12,370
Yoink.

4883
04:16:15,030 --> 04:16:16,430
I hate that skin.

4884
04:16:17,050 --> 04:16:18,250
It's so annoying.

4885
04:16:18,730 --> 04:16:22,590
It looks great, but that skin is so annoying when you're playing it.

4886
04:16:22,950 --> 04:16:24,250
Cause every...

4887
04:16:24,250 --> 04:16:26,350
Every shot is just...

4888
04:16:26,350 --> 04:16:27,030
Like guitar.

4889
04:16:27,230 --> 04:16:28,610
Like it's just...

4890
04:16:28,610 --> 04:16:31,190
I hate that the skin has special sound effects.

4891
04:16:31,310 --> 04:16:33,710
Cause the special sound effects are so distracting.

4892
04:16:35,530 --> 04:16:36,450
Do I play DPS?

4893
04:16:36,530 --> 04:16:37,170
Cause it's fun.

4894
04:16:38,230 --> 04:16:40,110
I just can't play it in Eternity level.

4895
04:16:43,150 --> 04:16:45,530
You have to admit, DPS is fun.

4896
04:16:46,210 --> 04:16:47,750
I'm just not good enough for it.

4897
04:16:47,890 --> 04:16:48,950
And you don't want to play...

4898
04:16:48,950 --> 04:16:51,850
You don't want to watch me play DPS in fucking Doom.

4899
04:16:52,410 --> 04:16:53,950
In like Doom queues.

4900
04:16:58,850 --> 04:16:59,290
They...

4901
04:16:59,290 --> 04:17:00,430
I don't know.

4902
04:17:00,590 --> 04:17:01,050
I don't know.

4903
04:17:01,170 --> 04:17:04,290
Those sound effects are so obnoxious when you're playing Spider-Man.

4904
04:17:07,780 --> 04:17:09,080
I just think that...

4905
04:17:09,080 --> 04:17:11,080
I don't like the low-key...

4906
04:17:11,080 --> 04:17:12,480
That low-key...

4907
04:17:12,480 --> 04:17:14,880
Was it the Demon Lord skin or whatever?

4908
04:17:16,660 --> 04:17:17,740
There's nobody here.

4909
04:17:18,740 --> 04:17:20,320
I leave this one in every queue.

4910
04:17:21,960 --> 04:17:23,700
But like, they have like...

4911
04:17:23,700 --> 04:17:24,220
What was it?

4912
04:17:24,240 --> 04:17:25,080
It's for like...

4913
04:17:26,400 --> 04:17:28,180
I think the ones I hate is...

4914
04:17:30,780 --> 04:17:31,760
Where is low-key?

4915
04:17:32,000 --> 04:17:32,640
This one?

4916
04:17:32,740 --> 04:17:33,700
I don't like...

4917
04:17:33,700 --> 04:17:35,100
I don't like this skin's...

4918
04:17:36,400 --> 04:17:37,440
The Butcher skin.

4919
04:17:37,580 --> 04:17:40,100
When he does the echo sound when he talks.

4920
04:17:40,100 --> 04:17:41,080
Cause it's really annoying.

4921
04:17:41,660 --> 04:17:43,020
And the Spider-Man one.

4922
04:17:43,140 --> 04:17:43,900
And the Luna one.

4923
04:17:43,980 --> 04:17:44,880
I hate...

4924
04:17:44,880 --> 04:17:47,420
I hate the sound effects for this one.

4925
04:17:48,380 --> 04:17:49,420
It's too loud.

4926
04:17:50,920 --> 04:17:53,660
For like being competitive, I'm just not used to it.

4927
04:17:54,160 --> 04:17:55,240
It's way too loud.

4928
04:17:55,980 --> 04:17:59,140
I feel like the sound balancing for them is not as like...

4929
04:17:59,140 --> 04:18:00,840
It's not the same as the default.

4930
04:18:01,860 --> 04:18:04,180
And then also the Spider-Man one.

4931
04:18:04,400 --> 04:18:05,300
I don't like it.

4932
04:18:06,440 --> 04:18:07,640
This one is so annoying.

4933
04:18:07,640 --> 04:18:11,080
Every little fucking flick you do is a sound effect.

4934
04:18:13,800 --> 04:18:15,820
Yeah, I'm too much of a nerd.

4935
04:18:18,840 --> 04:18:21,500
I'm too much of a nerd when it comes to like...

4936
04:18:21,500 --> 04:18:22,140
Competitive.

4937
04:18:22,180 --> 04:18:23,740
I just don't like...

4938
04:18:23,740 --> 04:18:24,720
I just don't like it.

4939
04:18:24,960 --> 04:18:26,100
It's just too annoying.

4940
04:18:26,520 --> 04:18:27,980
Oh, this one has a lot of players.

4941
04:18:30,720 --> 04:18:32,940
How long have I been streaming so far, chat?

4942
04:18:34,660 --> 04:18:35,340
Are they roleplaying?

4943
04:18:37,740 --> 04:18:39,020
Are they roleplayers?

4944
04:18:39,140 --> 04:18:40,680
Oh, they are definitely not roleplaying.

4945
04:18:41,340 --> 04:18:41,820
Look at him go.

4946
04:18:42,340 --> 04:18:44,540
Look at the Wolverine just running away.

4947
04:18:45,020 --> 04:18:46,880
It's just like...

4948
04:18:47,620 --> 04:18:49,360
He's just running away.

4949
04:18:49,620 --> 04:18:50,260
He's like, nope.

4950
04:18:55,140 --> 04:18:56,740
Oh, come on.

4951
04:18:58,760 --> 04:18:59,040
Like...

4952
04:19:00,600 --> 04:19:01,600
Where did he go?

4953
04:19:02,320 --> 04:19:03,340
That's my kill.

4954
04:19:04,160 --> 04:19:04,980
Doesn't matter.

4955
04:19:05,740 --> 04:19:06,920
That's my kill.

4956
04:19:08,120 --> 04:19:10,040
I think her default skin is the best one.

4957
04:19:10,100 --> 04:19:10,700
No, I agree.

4958
04:19:11,260 --> 04:19:11,860
That's why...

4959
04:19:11,860 --> 04:19:14,780
I think all her skins so far are really ugly.

4960
04:19:14,880 --> 04:19:15,220
IMO.

4961
04:19:15,800 --> 04:19:17,520
I'm not a huge fan of their skins.

4962
04:19:20,720 --> 04:19:21,920
I don't like...

4963
04:19:25,380 --> 04:19:25,900
What?!

4964
04:19:25,900 --> 04:19:28,520
Oh, just cause you're married.

4965
04:19:29,720 --> 04:19:30,240
Just...

4966
04:19:32,080 --> 04:19:33,920
Oh, just cause you're married.

4967
04:19:34,060 --> 04:19:34,920
That's not fair.

4968
04:19:35,520 --> 04:19:38,080
Actual marriage diff right there.

4969
04:19:38,560 --> 04:19:39,760
I was like, what?

4970
04:19:40,860 --> 04:19:42,380
Wait, they are roleplaying.

4971
04:19:43,580 --> 04:19:44,660
Oh my god.

4972
04:19:44,720 --> 04:19:45,840
I mean, they've been here for...

4973
04:19:45,840 --> 04:19:47,220
These are like actual...

4974
04:19:47,920 --> 04:19:49,980
These are regular roleplay lobbies.

4975
04:19:57,350 --> 04:19:58,250
Yeah, that's right.

4976
04:19:58,490 --> 04:20:00,250
I'm ruining this roleplay.

4977
04:20:01,590 --> 04:20:02,490
That's right.

4978
04:20:02,750 --> 04:20:04,110
No roleplay for you.

4979
04:20:04,750 --> 04:20:05,910
Wait, where did you come from?

4980
04:20:09,170 --> 04:20:09,970
Oh.

4981
04:20:09,970 --> 04:20:10,950
No roleplay for you.

4982
04:20:13,110 --> 04:20:14,710
Oh, shit.

4983
04:20:15,190 --> 04:20:15,810
Oh, shit.

4984
04:20:17,830 --> 04:20:18,290
Oh.

4985
04:20:21,650 --> 04:20:22,590
No roleplay.

4986
04:20:23,870 --> 04:20:24,310
Oh.

4987
04:20:25,250 --> 04:20:26,830
Whoa, where did I go?

4988
04:20:28,590 --> 04:20:30,030
Oh, he's lucky.

4989
04:20:30,930 --> 04:20:32,030
Oh, no.

4990
04:20:32,090 --> 04:20:32,810
I'm not lucky.

4991
04:20:35,910 --> 04:20:37,250
Oh my god.

4992
04:20:37,910 --> 04:20:39,670
I wasn't lucky there.

4993
04:20:42,130 --> 04:20:43,350
No, no, no.

4994
04:20:43,430 --> 04:20:45,170
He fixed his ult.

4995
04:20:46,190 --> 04:20:48,890
He actually fucked up his ult there.

4996
04:20:51,550 --> 04:20:52,070
Poor guy.

4997
04:20:54,070 --> 04:20:55,810
It's roleplay, Spiderman dies.

4998
04:20:56,070 --> 04:20:56,350
Really?

4999
04:20:57,710 --> 04:20:58,730
That's sad.

5000
04:20:59,170 --> 04:20:59,570
Really?

5001
04:20:59,730 --> 04:21:00,370
You're a rocket.

5002
04:21:00,470 --> 04:21:01,290
You're a little guy.

5003
04:21:01,790 --> 04:21:03,430
You're just a little guy.

5004
04:21:03,730 --> 04:21:05,370
How are Qs so long?

5005
04:21:05,370 --> 04:21:07,850
Are Qs that long in the morning?

5006
04:21:09,070 --> 04:21:10,510
If your wife comes over.

5007
04:21:10,710 --> 04:21:13,290
If your wife comes over, you know what I'm gonna do.

5008
04:21:13,630 --> 04:21:14,790
That's fucking right.

5009
04:21:14,930 --> 04:21:15,710
I'll kill both.

5010
04:21:15,750 --> 04:21:16,390
I have ult.

5011
04:21:16,670 --> 04:21:17,930
I can kill both of you.

5012
04:21:21,510 --> 04:21:25,030
You know what I hope rivals have in the future?

5013
04:21:26,130 --> 04:21:28,010
Custom lobbies where you can customize.

5014
04:21:28,190 --> 04:21:30,310
Custom lobbies like Overwatch.

5015
04:21:30,310 --> 04:21:37,070
Then people will do those chill or kill lobbies.

5016
04:21:37,250 --> 04:21:48,310
People are using Doom Qs, Doom lobbies as the actual chill or kick lobbies.

5017
04:21:49,230 --> 04:21:51,410
And then people actually are just like...

5018
04:21:54,170 --> 04:21:55,650
Eat dating.

5019
04:21:55,650 --> 04:21:55,710
Eat dating.

5020
04:21:58,450 --> 04:21:59,970
I think...

5021
04:21:59,970 --> 04:22:03,070
I've seen the ones that were like...

5022
04:22:03,070 --> 04:22:05,770
18 plus mic only.

5023
04:22:07,370 --> 04:22:10,290
Mercy player looking for E-boy.

5024
04:22:17,310 --> 04:22:19,830
The titles are like...

5025
04:22:19,830 --> 04:22:20,150
Yeah!

5026
04:22:20,510 --> 04:22:24,650
If you open up Overwatch 2 right now, you'll find that...

5027
04:22:25,450 --> 04:22:26,750
Exact lobby.

5028
04:22:27,310 --> 04:22:29,230
Not the exact naming.

5029
04:22:29,810 --> 04:22:32,290
But 70 variations of that name.

5030
04:22:34,590 --> 04:22:37,750
I remember when I had time.

5031
04:22:38,250 --> 04:22:40,330
You know, when I actually had a life.

5032
04:22:40,750 --> 04:22:43,450
It was funny to see like...

5033
04:22:43,450 --> 04:22:45,210
Whoa, that's cool.

5034
04:22:45,550 --> 04:22:46,090
That's five.

5035
04:22:46,930 --> 04:22:52,370
I went into one of them and just sat there and listened to the conversation.

5036
04:22:52,370 --> 04:22:55,230
Because I was curious as to like...

5037
04:22:55,230 --> 04:22:57,070
What do they talk about, you know?

5038
04:22:57,510 --> 04:23:02,030
Like, what do they talk about?

5039
04:23:03,810 --> 04:23:05,350
In these lobbies.

5040
04:23:05,610 --> 04:23:07,430
And it's very interesting.

5041
04:23:08,030 --> 04:23:10,510
And some people apparently...

5042
04:23:10,510 --> 04:23:12,890
Because some people know each other.

5043
04:23:13,030 --> 04:23:13,790
And they'll be like...

5044
04:23:13,790 --> 04:23:16,210
Oh yeah, I saw you in that other lobby the other day.

5045
04:23:16,270 --> 04:23:18,150
In the other chill lobby.

5046
04:23:18,590 --> 04:23:20,790
And that's what they do every day.

5047
04:23:20,790 --> 04:23:22,950
All they do is just...

5048
04:23:23,570 --> 04:23:25,690
Is just sit in those...

5049
04:23:25,690 --> 04:23:31,590
They just open up Overwatch and sit in those lobbies.

5050
04:23:31,770 --> 04:23:33,230
To have conversations.

5051
04:23:34,190 --> 04:23:37,610
But they don't play the game.

5052
04:23:38,110 --> 04:23:39,810
They don't play Overwatch.

5053
04:23:40,470 --> 04:23:43,250
It's like their social interaction for the day.

5054
04:23:46,430 --> 04:23:50,510
You know how people boot up VRChat to talk to people?

5055
04:23:50,510 --> 04:23:52,190
I'm fucking... I wanna ban Groot.

5056
04:23:52,450 --> 04:23:53,070
There's no way.

5057
04:23:53,250 --> 04:23:53,990
There's no way.

5058
04:23:54,150 --> 04:23:55,290
Not the 25er.

5059
04:23:55,750 --> 04:23:56,090
There's...

5060
04:23:58,090 --> 04:23:59,630
Oh my god.

5061
04:23:59,790 --> 04:24:01,370
The 25er.

5062
04:24:04,170 --> 04:24:05,150
They are playing...

5063
04:24:05,150 --> 04:24:07,230
No, they are playing a different game.

5064
04:24:08,170 --> 04:24:11,730
I'm not going Luna for the fucker that did not ban...

5065
04:24:11,730 --> 04:24:13,230
That didn't ban...

5066
04:24:13,230 --> 04:24:17,510
I'm not going Luna for the fucker that did not ban Groot.

5067
04:24:18,870 --> 04:24:20,890
You have hope someone else goes Luna.

5068
04:24:21,070 --> 04:24:22,870
You're not getting the Luna team up.

5069
04:24:22,990 --> 04:24:23,990
You fucker.

5070
04:24:32,720 --> 04:24:33,480
That's right.

5071
04:24:33,540 --> 04:24:35,400
I don't care enough to give you Luna.

5072
04:24:38,140 --> 04:24:39,300
I wanted...

5073
04:24:39,300 --> 04:24:42,900
I wanted the fucking Groot ban.

5074
04:24:46,880 --> 04:24:48,660
Give me Groot ban now.

5075
04:24:52,280 --> 04:24:53,140
It's the namer.

5076
04:24:53,320 --> 04:24:54,900
Like, Magneto does nothing for him.

5077
04:24:54,980 --> 04:24:56,980
He can block the Magneto with his fucking bubble.

5078
04:24:57,600 --> 04:24:58,940
What are you afraid of?

5079
04:24:59,200 --> 04:25:00,840
What are you afraid of, you fucking coward?

5080
04:25:01,220 --> 04:25:02,220
Look at me in the face.

5081
04:25:02,260 --> 04:25:03,520
What are you afraid of?

5082
04:25:04,320 --> 04:25:07,320
That moment that name gets on streamer mode, I'm looking you up.

5083
04:25:15,080 --> 04:25:16,180
Alright, let's go.

5084
04:25:16,300 --> 04:25:17,720
We have Penny Venom.

5085
04:25:17,900 --> 04:25:19,560
This is not it, but it's okay.

5086
04:25:20,440 --> 04:25:21,120
It's low elo.

5087
04:25:21,120 --> 04:25:22,380
Anything can work.

5088
04:25:23,440 --> 04:25:24,080
Honestly, no.

5089
04:25:24,280 --> 04:25:27,200
Like, you don't have to worry about playing meta until you get to...

5090
04:25:27,660 --> 04:25:30,580
Until you get to, like, Eternity 200.

5091
04:25:32,040 --> 04:25:33,200
Like, anything can...

5092
04:25:33,200 --> 04:25:34,620
Unless you have...

5093
04:25:35,100 --> 04:25:37,120
Unless you have, like...

5094
04:25:37,120 --> 04:25:37,560
There you go.

5095
04:25:40,740 --> 04:25:42,740
Unless you have a really good one trick player.

5096
04:25:42,940 --> 04:25:44,620
Like, I know so many really good...

5097
04:25:44,620 --> 04:25:45,280
What the...

5098
04:25:45,280 --> 04:25:46,740
It, like, instantly destroyed.

5099
04:25:46,880 --> 04:25:47,340
Got destroyed.

5100
04:25:47,840 --> 04:25:48,560
That's crazy.

5101
04:25:57,000 --> 04:25:57,900
Jesus Christ.

5102
04:25:58,760 --> 04:26:00,000
I'm just trying...

5103
04:26:00,800 --> 04:26:01,320
Nice.

5104
04:26:03,420 --> 04:26:04,400
Get on the point.

5105
04:26:04,520 --> 04:26:05,260
Get on the point.

5106
04:26:05,440 --> 04:26:06,220
Get on the point.

5107
04:26:08,460 --> 04:26:09,480
I got...

5108
04:26:09,480 --> 04:26:10,440
That's actually crazy.

5109
04:26:10,500 --> 04:26:11,880
I was getting instantly destroyed.

5110
04:26:16,590 --> 04:26:17,110
Yay!

5111
04:26:17,290 --> 04:26:18,190
Vortex Fields!

5112
04:26:18,750 --> 04:26:19,090
There you go.

5113
04:26:19,110 --> 04:26:19,590
You get that.

5114
04:26:20,990 --> 04:26:21,830
There you go.

5115
04:26:22,550 --> 04:26:24,370
I'm saving my push for the Panther.

5116
04:26:26,690 --> 04:26:27,890
If he's still there.

5117
04:26:30,350 --> 04:26:31,470
There you go.

5118
04:26:32,430 --> 04:26:33,550
Couldn't get that away.

5119
04:26:34,110 --> 04:26:34,410
Woo!

5120
04:26:34,570 --> 04:26:35,050
Goodbye!

5121
04:26:38,290 --> 04:26:38,810
Goodbye.

5122
04:26:39,610 --> 04:26:41,370
That's a little embarrassing for you.

5123
04:26:45,010 --> 04:26:46,070
Oh, this is bad.

5124
04:26:46,290 --> 04:26:46,610
Okay.

5125
04:26:47,150 --> 04:26:48,070
It's not bad anymore.

5126
04:26:48,150 --> 04:26:49,810
I don't have push, though, for our Luna.

5127
04:26:50,370 --> 04:26:51,110
But that's okay.

5128
04:26:51,210 --> 04:26:52,210
I don't need push.

5129
04:26:52,610 --> 04:26:54,450
I say it before I die.

5130
04:26:54,750 --> 04:26:55,530
It's okay.

5131
04:26:55,630 --> 04:26:56,850
I don't need push, guys.

5132
04:26:57,290 --> 04:26:58,590
Maybe he'll be over there.

5133
04:26:58,850 --> 04:26:59,190
Nice.

5134
04:27:01,970 --> 04:27:02,930
Oh, no.

5135
04:27:03,270 --> 04:27:03,610
Not the guy.

5136
04:27:04,810 --> 04:27:05,330
Wait.

5137
04:27:06,270 --> 04:27:07,250
Okay, nice.

5138
04:27:07,670 --> 04:27:08,870
We have this.

5139
04:27:13,250 --> 04:27:15,690
I don't know what's going on in there.

5140
04:27:15,910 --> 04:27:16,510
I'm out of ult.

5141
04:27:16,570 --> 04:27:18,630
I don't know what's going on in there.

5142
04:27:18,710 --> 04:27:20,610
Hope you guys are having a fun time.

5143
04:27:21,930 --> 04:27:23,310
Oh, there you go.

5144
04:27:23,450 --> 04:27:24,470
My orb's gone.

5145
04:27:25,930 --> 04:27:26,390
Nice.

5146
04:27:28,470 --> 04:27:28,990
Nice.

5147
04:27:29,110 --> 04:27:29,890
Kill that one guy.

5148
04:27:30,930 --> 04:27:31,270
Yeah!

5149
04:27:32,030 --> 04:27:32,290
Oh!

5150
04:27:33,410 --> 04:27:33,930
No!

5151
04:27:37,310 --> 04:27:39,010
Oh, he got...

5152
04:27:39,010 --> 04:27:40,270
He got...

5153
04:27:42,010 --> 04:27:43,310
Let's just fight on point.

5154
04:27:45,570 --> 04:27:46,910
I'm coming back.

5155
04:27:46,970 --> 04:27:47,650
I'm coming back.

5156
04:27:47,730 --> 04:27:48,150
I'm running.

5157
04:27:48,290 --> 04:27:48,790
I'm running.

5158
04:27:49,090 --> 04:27:49,630
I'll be there soon.

5159
04:27:49,730 --> 04:27:50,150
I'm almost there.

5160
04:27:50,430 --> 04:27:51,030
I'm running.

5161
04:27:51,170 --> 04:27:51,830
I'm running.

5162
04:27:54,190 --> 04:27:55,070
I'm running.

5163
04:27:55,210 --> 04:27:55,650
I'm running.

5164
04:27:55,790 --> 04:27:56,070
I'm running.

5165
04:27:59,390 --> 04:28:00,170
Don't worry.

5166
04:28:01,270 --> 04:28:01,990
Get on point.

5167
04:28:03,050 --> 04:28:04,070
Don't worry.

5168
04:28:05,190 --> 04:28:07,770
I had no idea how the fuck...

5169
04:28:07,770 --> 04:28:08,390
We can win this.

5170
04:28:08,430 --> 04:28:09,170
Yeah, I'm not using ult.

5171
04:28:09,370 --> 04:28:10,270
There's no reason to.

5172
04:28:12,190 --> 04:28:12,790
What?

5173
04:28:12,910 --> 04:28:13,430
Where did he go?

5174
04:28:15,950 --> 04:28:16,550
Okay.

5175
04:28:16,890 --> 04:28:17,710
Where'd he go?

5176
04:28:18,150 --> 04:28:18,490
Nice.

5177
04:28:20,610 --> 04:28:21,210
Nice.

5178
04:28:21,490 --> 04:28:21,830
Easy.

5179
04:28:23,690 --> 04:28:24,790
Okay, I right...

5180
04:28:24,790 --> 04:28:25,550
I...

5181
04:28:25,550 --> 04:28:27,730
I ult first.

5182
04:28:28,690 --> 04:28:29,010
Okay.

5183
04:28:30,390 --> 04:28:30,830
Okay.

5184
04:28:31,610 --> 04:28:32,170
There we go.

5185
04:28:32,330 --> 04:28:32,630
My...

5186
04:28:32,630 --> 04:28:33,930
My calm of the year.

5187
04:28:35,390 --> 04:28:37,890
It's surprising how much that actually helps out.

5188
04:28:38,890 --> 04:28:41,330
Strange, thank you for the five gifted ships!

5189
04:28:41,390 --> 04:28:41,790
Oh, subs.

5190
04:28:41,830 --> 04:28:42,010
Sorry.

5191
04:28:42,130 --> 04:28:42,870
Fuck, I'm not on YouTube.

5192
04:28:43,150 --> 04:28:43,650
I'm not on YouTube.

5193
04:28:44,390 --> 04:28:45,210
I'm on Twitch.

5194
04:28:45,510 --> 04:28:46,350
Five gifted subs!

5195
04:28:46,510 --> 04:28:47,410
Thank you!

5196
04:28:47,910 --> 04:28:51,150
Akira, thank you for the tier one sub for two months!

5197
04:28:51,670 --> 04:28:51,910
Alright.

5198
04:28:54,630 --> 04:28:55,070
Yippee!

5199
04:28:57,010 --> 04:28:58,710
What the fuck are these names?

5200
04:28:59,510 --> 04:29:01,830
Ayo, we were just in doom.

5201
04:29:02,310 --> 04:29:02,670
Wait, who?

5202
04:29:03,610 --> 04:29:04,830
You talking about me?

5203
04:29:05,150 --> 04:29:05,830
Or...

5204
04:29:05,830 --> 04:29:06,030
Who?

5205
04:29:06,170 --> 04:29:06,490
Me?

5206
04:29:07,510 --> 04:29:08,490
John King Kong?

5207
04:29:09,370 --> 04:29:10,330
Yes, the Asylum.

5208
04:29:11,050 --> 04:29:11,750
Oh, they are...

5209
04:29:11,750 --> 04:29:13,110
Oh, they were both roleplaying.

5210
04:29:13,710 --> 04:29:13,930
Whoa!

5211
04:29:15,450 --> 04:29:15,890
Whoa!

5212
04:29:18,470 --> 04:29:20,810
The Penny and the...

5213
04:29:20,810 --> 04:29:21,730
The Hella.

5214
04:29:22,710 --> 04:29:24,830
Alone in the roleplay room.

5215
04:29:25,530 --> 04:29:26,610
Bringing them back.

5216
04:29:26,850 --> 04:29:27,130
Put...

5217
04:29:27,130 --> 04:29:28,330
They should bring it back.

5218
04:29:29,290 --> 04:29:30,250
Just for...

5219
04:29:31,310 --> 04:29:33,170
Just for Marble Rivals.

5220
04:29:34,310 --> 04:29:35,550
I wish they would do that.

5221
04:29:36,810 --> 04:29:37,730
Oh, Moonlight.

5222
04:29:37,790 --> 04:29:39,230
I haven't seen a fucking Moonlight in years.

5223
04:29:41,350 --> 04:29:43,130
But obviously, like, any ELO...

5224
04:29:43,890 --> 04:29:45,890
You don't need to play meta in this ELO.

5225
04:29:48,350 --> 04:29:50,510
I mean, it's helpful, but like...

5226
04:29:50,970 --> 04:29:52,770
This is a wild, wild west.

5227
04:29:53,830 --> 04:29:55,350
What are you doing?

5228
04:29:57,130 --> 04:29:58,630
What's your plan?

5229
04:29:59,630 --> 04:30:01,550
What was your plan, buddy?

5230
04:30:02,950 --> 04:30:04,530
What was...

5231
04:30:05,130 --> 04:30:06,650
Actual, what was your plan?

5232
04:30:08,130 --> 04:30:09,150
That was interesting.

5233
04:30:10,110 --> 04:30:10,870
Whoa!

5234
04:30:11,750 --> 04:30:12,770
Going back here.

5235
04:30:12,950 --> 04:30:13,810
Going back here.

5236
04:30:15,830 --> 04:30:17,110
Going here.

5237
04:30:19,010 --> 04:30:19,410
Oh no.

5238
04:30:22,670 --> 04:30:25,010
Yes, he is.

5239
04:30:26,270 --> 04:30:27,210
Yes, he is.

5240
04:30:27,290 --> 04:30:29,290
All I have to do is just knock in Agumoto.

5241
04:30:30,990 --> 04:30:32,030
That's basically it.

5242
04:30:33,670 --> 04:30:35,870
Oh, I hope he doesn't follow me.

5243
04:30:39,810 --> 04:30:39,970
Oh.

5244
04:30:41,950 --> 04:30:42,910
There we go.

5245
04:30:47,570 --> 04:30:50,330
Guys, I think the strange ass started to disassociate.

5246
04:30:50,610 --> 04:30:52,190
He is not playing the game anymore.

5247
04:30:52,190 --> 04:30:54,370
He is absolutely...

5248
04:30:55,370 --> 04:30:59,450
I don't know if you noticed it, but I don't think the strange is, like, actually playing...

5249
04:30:59,450 --> 04:30:59,970
Oh, what?

5250
04:31:01,050 --> 04:31:01,810
Get out.

5251
04:31:02,490 --> 04:31:03,750
Get out of here.

5252
04:31:04,710 --> 04:31:05,170
There we go.

5253
04:31:06,570 --> 04:31:06,850
Oh.

5254
04:31:07,510 --> 04:31:13,500
That is not alright.

5255
04:31:15,520 --> 04:31:16,560
I don't...

5256
04:31:16,560 --> 04:31:17,000
Oh.

5257
04:31:17,360 --> 04:31:17,880
Unlucky.

5258
04:31:19,360 --> 04:31:21,240
Strange, please, what are you doing, strange?

5259
04:31:21,930 --> 04:31:23,340
He is not playing the game.

5260
04:31:23,420 --> 04:31:24,440
I'm avoiding him.

5261
04:31:24,540 --> 04:31:24,860
I...

5262
04:31:26,890 --> 04:31:31,280
He is absolutely not playing the game anymore.

5263
04:31:34,740 --> 04:31:35,480
Yeah.

5264
04:31:36,440 --> 04:31:37,140
That...

5265
04:31:37,140 --> 04:31:38,240
That strange...

5266
04:31:39,990 --> 04:31:42,040
He should refund his skin.

5267
04:31:43,920 --> 04:31:47,940
He should refund his skin and never play again.

5268
04:31:48,180 --> 04:31:49,300
Play strange again.

5269
04:31:49,540 --> 04:31:50,760
It's not made for him.

5270
04:31:50,760 --> 04:31:51,720
100%.

5271
04:31:52,780 --> 04:31:55,060
It is absolutely not made for him.

5272
04:32:01,180 --> 04:32:02,320
Don't worry, I got you.

5273
04:32:02,440 --> 04:32:03,460
Stand behind me.

5274
04:32:06,200 --> 04:32:06,580
Oh.

5275
04:32:06,740 --> 04:32:07,220
What?

5276
04:32:07,700 --> 04:32:08,480
Oh, shit.

5277
04:32:11,920 --> 04:32:12,740
Oh, nice.

5278
04:32:12,920 --> 04:32:13,220
There you go.

5279
04:32:15,500 --> 04:32:16,740
I wish you could.

5280
04:32:19,300 --> 04:32:21,060
He's a lord.

5281
04:32:21,740 --> 04:32:22,040
He's a lord?

5282
04:32:22,040 --> 04:32:23,800
There's no way.

5283
04:32:28,130 --> 04:32:29,930
There's no way.

5284
04:32:30,870 --> 04:32:32,290
He's a lord.

5285
04:32:33,030 --> 04:32:34,930
There's no way.

5286
04:32:39,190 --> 04:32:41,350
Oh, look at that, plus 19.

5287
04:32:41,670 --> 04:32:42,690
Look at that.

5288
04:32:43,470 --> 04:32:44,970
I have to avoid him.

5289
04:32:45,230 --> 04:32:47,650
That was not...

5290
04:32:47,650 --> 04:32:52,610
That was not ideal to watch at all.

5291
04:32:57,380 --> 04:32:57,980
Alright.

5292
04:32:58,820 --> 04:32:59,360
Am I MVP?

5293
04:32:59,620 --> 04:33:00,540
Oh, look, that was me.

5294
04:33:00,780 --> 04:33:01,580
What did I do?

5295
04:33:02,960 --> 04:33:04,460
I guess I did pretty alright.

5296
04:33:07,520 --> 04:33:09,020
Oh, my god.

5297
04:33:10,620 --> 04:33:13,760
We all saw what he was doing, right?

5298
04:33:14,240 --> 04:33:15,240
On Strange.

5299
04:33:15,240 --> 04:33:18,520
He was not a functioning person.

5300
04:33:19,100 --> 04:33:24,080
He was absolutely not functioning at all.

5301
04:33:26,520 --> 04:33:29,760
Alright, back in the mines I go.

5302
04:33:30,780 --> 04:33:31,920
Yeah, that's the best part.

5303
04:33:32,060 --> 04:33:33,760
I wish they gave us more exploit slots.

5304
04:33:34,720 --> 04:33:38,640
Like, you have to stack so you can get more...

5305
04:33:39,340 --> 04:33:39,840
Whoa!

5306
04:33:40,740 --> 04:33:41,880
Not cool, buddy.

5307
04:33:42,860 --> 04:33:43,300
Wait, what?

5308
04:33:43,340 --> 04:33:43,880
That hit me?

5309
04:33:45,240 --> 04:33:46,040
Not cool.

5310
04:33:46,280 --> 04:33:46,820
Whoa.

5311
04:33:47,280 --> 04:33:47,700
What?

5312
04:33:48,320 --> 04:33:48,960
Taquito?

5313
04:33:50,780 --> 04:33:51,680
What?

5314
04:33:53,800 --> 04:33:54,880
What the fuck?

5315
04:33:55,960 --> 04:33:57,080
What?

5316
04:34:01,470 --> 04:34:03,130
What the fuck?

5317
04:34:03,850 --> 04:34:05,050
Question mark?

5318
04:34:06,170 --> 04:34:07,250
Oh, my god.

5319
04:34:07,310 --> 04:34:08,210
Playing...

5320
04:34:08,210 --> 04:34:10,450
Playing tank in...

5321
04:34:10,450 --> 04:34:15,450
Playing tank in Doom matches is like...

5322
04:34:15,450 --> 04:34:16,850
It's just like Overwatch.

5323
04:34:17,990 --> 04:34:19,510
Like, why?

5324
04:34:19,970 --> 04:34:22,070
How do you enjoy this?

5325
04:34:26,990 --> 04:34:29,790
Like, I don't understand.

5326
04:34:33,730 --> 04:34:34,690
Me big.

5327
04:34:35,030 --> 04:34:36,770
Me throw punch big.

5328
04:34:42,090 --> 04:34:43,890
He just wants to be a big man.

5329
04:34:45,390 --> 04:34:46,830
Puny Sylar.

5330
04:34:47,950 --> 04:34:50,070
Like, I think we'll get him just...

5331
04:34:50,070 --> 04:34:51,430
Don't worry, we'll double team him.

5332
04:34:51,670 --> 04:34:52,490
Don't worry.

5333
04:34:52,930 --> 04:34:54,030
We'll kill him together.

5334
04:34:54,150 --> 04:34:54,690
Don't worry.

5335
04:34:55,130 --> 04:34:56,870
We shall unite together.

5336
04:34:57,270 --> 04:34:58,070
Let's go.

5337
04:34:58,190 --> 04:34:58,970
We did it.

5338
04:34:59,050 --> 04:34:59,830
Oh, goodbye.

5339
04:35:02,130 --> 04:35:04,930
Okay, but like...

5340
04:35:05,710 --> 04:35:06,490
Oh, my god.

5341
04:35:06,590 --> 04:35:09,290
What is my RNG of that ult?

5342
04:35:10,530 --> 04:35:12,010
Oh, my god.

5343
04:35:12,090 --> 04:35:13,510
The RNG for that ult.

5344
04:35:14,030 --> 04:35:14,570
Fuck you.

5345
04:35:19,190 --> 04:35:20,270
You're not...

5346
04:35:20,270 --> 04:35:22,630
Thank god I know where the health pack is.

5347
04:35:23,150 --> 04:35:25,110
You're not getting that health pack.

5348
04:35:26,570 --> 04:35:30,410
I refuse to let you get that health pack.

5349
04:35:33,940 --> 04:35:34,980
That's what I hate.

5350
04:35:35,040 --> 04:35:37,180
Sometimes these Psylocke RNG is so stupid.

5351
04:35:39,300 --> 04:35:41,680
Alright, either I get this or like...

5352
04:35:42,500 --> 04:35:44,000
I just...

5353
04:35:44,000 --> 04:35:46,900
It's GG on character select.

5354
04:35:51,200 --> 04:35:52,680
Who is not loaded in?

5355
04:35:52,760 --> 04:35:54,920
Who is my guy that's not loaded in?

5356
04:35:55,420 --> 04:35:55,940
Mr8.

5357
04:35:56,660 --> 04:35:57,180
MrLevel76.

5358
04:35:57,420 --> 04:35:58,260
That's level 8.

5359
04:35:58,460 --> 04:35:58,920
Wait, okay.

5360
04:35:58,980 --> 04:36:00,160
Let's see how many...

5361
04:36:00,160 --> 04:36:01,120
Oh, I was gonna say...

5362
04:36:01,120 --> 04:36:02,900
Are there any ult account players too?

5363
04:36:03,760 --> 04:36:04,700
Oh, okay.

5364
04:36:05,220 --> 04:36:06,480
Oh, he plays everything.

5365
04:36:07,360 --> 04:36:08,460
I wanna Loki.

5366
04:36:10,440 --> 04:36:11,860
You go play other support.

5367
04:36:11,980 --> 04:36:12,580
I Loki.

5368
04:36:17,580 --> 04:36:18,100
Rude.

5369
04:36:19,560 --> 04:36:20,080
Rude.

5370
04:36:20,080 --> 04:36:21,300
Oh my god, people are talking.

5371
04:36:21,460 --> 04:36:22,040
It's 7am...

5372
04:36:22,040 --> 04:36:22,900
It's 9am.

5373
04:36:25,760 --> 04:36:27,180
Get Groot out of here.

5374
04:36:27,980 --> 04:36:29,060
Get him out of here!

5375
04:36:30,380 --> 04:36:31,500
Get him out!

5376
04:36:33,920 --> 04:36:34,560
Why?!

5377
04:36:43,870 --> 04:36:45,770
Now let me pick!

5378
04:36:49,910 --> 04:36:50,970
Doesn't matter!

5379
04:36:51,510 --> 04:36:52,850
Fucking hate that character.

5380
04:36:53,690 --> 04:36:55,890
This character fucking sucks!

5381
04:36:57,770 --> 04:36:59,010
I swear, this guy...

5382
04:36:59,010 --> 04:36:59,850
Okay, there you go.

5383
04:37:08,020 --> 04:37:09,360
That was unfortunate.

5384
04:37:10,000 --> 04:37:12,060
That was so unfortunate for me.

5385
04:37:16,160 --> 04:37:18,280
Luna's open if any of you guys can.

5386
04:37:19,680 --> 04:37:20,900
No, Luna.

5387
04:37:22,060 --> 04:37:23,060
Oh, do you want it?

5388
04:37:24,340 --> 04:37:25,020
No.

5389
04:37:31,860 --> 04:37:32,200
No!

5390
04:37:32,940 --> 04:37:34,860
I don't like how people call him strategist.

5391
04:37:35,000 --> 04:37:35,940
Just call him support.

5392
04:37:36,180 --> 04:37:38,100
It's a fucking support character.

5393
04:37:38,680 --> 04:37:39,360
Don't...

5394
04:37:39,360 --> 04:37:41,120
We don't need to be fancy here.

5395
04:37:41,720 --> 04:37:43,880
Yeah, I'm a Vanguard player.

5396
04:37:44,000 --> 04:37:44,280
Tink!

5397
04:37:44,560 --> 04:37:45,460
It's Tink!

5398
04:37:48,820 --> 04:37:49,500
Yeah.

5399
04:37:50,240 --> 04:37:51,540
I'm a Vanguard.

5400
04:37:52,480 --> 04:37:52,840
Why?!

5401
04:37:53,200 --> 04:37:54,400
It's two syllables!

5402
04:37:55,020 --> 04:37:56,120
Tink is one!

5403
04:37:57,900 --> 04:37:59,880
True Vanguard is free.

5404
04:38:00,500 --> 04:38:01,220
Nerd!

5405
04:38:03,820 --> 04:38:07,400
It's more Chuni like that.

5406
04:38:10,800 --> 04:38:11,880
It's DPS.

5407
04:38:12,500 --> 04:38:14,760
DPS sounds cooler than fucking duelist.

5408
04:38:17,940 --> 04:38:18,660
Okay.

5409
04:38:18,900 --> 04:38:20,100
I don't know if that's where you put it.

5410
04:38:20,160 --> 04:38:20,560
I'm learning.

5411
04:38:22,800 --> 04:38:24,400
Guys, I'm learning, guys.

5412
04:38:25,220 --> 04:38:26,500
Clearly it was not...

5413
04:38:28,000 --> 04:38:28,620
Not...

5414
04:38:29,340 --> 04:38:30,760
Clearly it wasn't.

5415
04:38:32,320 --> 04:38:34,520
Alright, I'm on their Luna right now.

5416
04:38:37,700 --> 04:38:39,300
Oh, it's okay.

5417
04:38:40,640 --> 04:38:42,060
It's not okay.

5418
04:38:45,200 --> 04:38:48,780
It's okay, but I guess we're not gonna...

5419
04:38:48,780 --> 04:38:50,160
Their Venom is here.

5420
04:38:53,460 --> 04:38:54,260
How do you know?

5421
04:38:54,600 --> 04:38:55,040
On the card?

5422
04:38:56,340 --> 04:38:56,960
I'm trying.

5423
04:38:57,200 --> 04:38:58,500
I am reloading.

5424
04:39:03,460 --> 04:39:05,480
Jesus Christ, there's so many.

5425
04:39:06,620 --> 04:39:06,920
Okay.

5426
04:39:07,880 --> 04:39:09,760
I have to use this whenever we get flamed.

5427
04:39:09,960 --> 04:39:10,760
It's Starlord Hydra.

5428
04:39:12,860 --> 04:39:13,860
Oh, Luna's one, Luna's one.

5429
04:39:14,400 --> 04:39:16,140
Oh my god, the reload, please!

5430
04:39:17,280 --> 04:39:17,960
Okay, nice.

5431
04:39:19,700 --> 04:39:20,980
Get this Loki.

5432
04:39:22,800 --> 04:39:23,640
It's fine.

5433
04:39:24,420 --> 04:39:25,320
It's fine.

5434
04:39:26,280 --> 04:39:28,400
It's fine, I still have my clones.

5435
04:39:29,120 --> 04:39:30,840
I still have both clones, it's fine.

5436
04:39:33,720 --> 04:39:34,580
It's fine.

5437
04:39:37,660 --> 04:39:38,960
What was my HP?

5438
04:39:39,580 --> 04:39:40,040
What?

5439
04:39:40,360 --> 04:39:41,700
What was my HP?

5440
04:39:41,740 --> 04:39:43,120
My HP was full!

5441
04:39:43,500 --> 04:39:45,080
What was my HP?

5442
04:39:46,480 --> 04:39:49,600
I swear to god, my HP was full.

5443
04:39:51,540 --> 04:39:52,280
It was...

5444
04:39:52,280 --> 04:39:55,660
It was full!

5445
04:39:56,000 --> 04:39:57,060
I saw it!

5446
04:39:57,660 --> 04:39:59,120
I saw it!

5447
04:39:59,640 --> 04:40:01,440
I was like, so healthy!

5448
04:40:01,920 --> 04:40:03,580
And then I was not?!

5449
04:40:08,520 --> 04:40:10,640
Oh my god!

5450
04:40:11,320 --> 04:40:11,840
Loki first.

5451
04:40:13,260 --> 04:40:14,980
Maybe Loki can do it.

5452
04:40:18,220 --> 04:40:18,880
There we go.

5453
04:40:19,880 --> 04:40:20,760
Okay.

5454
04:40:24,720 --> 04:40:25,540
Where is he?

5455
04:40:26,800 --> 04:40:28,220
Where was he?

5456
04:40:32,660 --> 04:40:33,540
Okay.

5457
04:40:35,500 --> 04:40:35,820
Okay.

5458
04:40:38,720 --> 04:40:41,160
I was like, I'm so healthy!

5459
04:40:41,940 --> 04:40:44,260
I felt so healthy.

5460
04:40:44,680 --> 04:40:47,180
I really did felt so healthy.

5461
04:40:47,180 --> 04:40:50,000
I really did.

5462
04:40:50,720 --> 04:40:52,640
Oh my god, where am I?

5463
04:40:52,820 --> 04:40:53,200
Woah!

5464
04:40:53,980 --> 04:40:55,360
Where did I go?

5465
04:40:58,100 --> 04:40:59,000
Oh, what?

5466
04:40:59,120 --> 04:40:59,380
Okay.

5467
04:41:00,760 --> 04:41:04,620
Okay, this would be very awkward when...

5468
04:41:10,260 --> 04:41:11,200
I'm alive!

5469
04:41:12,060 --> 04:41:13,500
Oh, thank god I had that!

5470
04:41:14,060 --> 04:41:14,520
Wait.

5471
04:41:15,260 --> 04:41:16,000
Oh, I can't block.

5472
04:41:17,180 --> 04:41:18,760
It's okay, I'm okay though.

5473
04:41:21,480 --> 04:41:23,840
Is there a Loki right here?

5474
04:41:28,880 --> 04:41:29,840
It's fine.

5475
04:41:30,280 --> 04:41:31,900
I'm shooting the ground, it's okay.

5476
04:41:32,440 --> 04:41:35,660
I'm doing the strat and shooting the ground.

5477
04:41:37,280 --> 04:41:40,660
Oh, I couldn't.

5478
04:41:40,780 --> 04:41:41,280
I had to reload.

5479
04:41:41,540 --> 04:41:42,520
My bad.

5480
04:41:45,120 --> 04:41:47,040
I had to reload, my bad.

5481
04:41:50,160 --> 04:41:51,940
Oh, that's unfortunate.

5482
04:41:52,460 --> 04:41:52,640
No!

5483
04:41:57,240 --> 04:41:59,540
Quick, swap to Strange at touch point!

5484
04:42:00,300 --> 04:42:00,940
Quick!

5485
04:42:02,320 --> 04:42:04,420
Oh, nobody wanted to.

5486
04:42:04,560 --> 04:42:06,840
I was trying to press Q onto them.

5487
04:42:07,620 --> 04:42:08,300
Sorry, I just reset.

5488
04:42:09,320 --> 04:42:12,500
We could have swapped to Strange.

5489
04:42:12,500 --> 04:42:13,560
Strange, I pressed Q!

5490
04:42:17,340 --> 04:42:17,740
What?

5491
04:42:20,400 --> 04:42:20,860
It's not.

5492
04:42:21,580 --> 04:42:22,600
Fuck me, I guess.

5493
04:42:24,920 --> 04:42:25,480
Wait, what?

5494
04:42:26,340 --> 04:42:26,680
There you go.

5495
04:42:26,820 --> 04:42:27,520
I have to use that.

5496
04:42:34,000 --> 04:42:34,400
Okay.

5497
04:42:35,680 --> 04:42:36,400
Oh, no.

5498
04:42:36,600 --> 04:42:37,280
Oh, no.

5499
04:42:37,320 --> 04:42:38,520
I couldn't get out of that.

5500
04:42:39,480 --> 04:42:40,880
Okay, we just gotta reset.

5501
04:42:41,680 --> 04:42:42,700
I couldn't get out.

5502
04:42:43,360 --> 04:42:45,000
I couldn't get out!

5503
04:42:45,120 --> 04:42:45,940
What happened there, man?

5504
04:42:48,000 --> 04:42:49,080
I don't know.

5505
04:42:49,360 --> 04:42:51,720
Oh, they're running Trip Support.

5506
04:42:51,920 --> 04:42:52,900
That's what happened.

5507
04:42:55,100 --> 04:42:56,380
What do you mean?

5508
04:42:56,440 --> 04:42:57,420
They ran Trip Support.

5509
04:42:58,280 --> 04:42:59,600
They need the crutch.

5510
04:42:59,720 --> 04:43:02,220
Okay, I need to copy Luna.

5511
04:43:05,260 --> 04:43:06,540
Okay, we swapped up.

5512
04:43:13,990 --> 04:43:14,630
Okay.

5513
04:43:15,190 --> 04:43:16,230
I blocked it.

5514
04:43:16,270 --> 04:43:17,390
Okay, let's go.

5515
04:43:17,430 --> 04:43:18,630
Wait, what?

5516
04:43:20,530 --> 04:43:21,170
Nice.

5517
04:43:21,850 --> 04:43:22,490
Nice.

5518
04:43:22,950 --> 04:43:23,270
Okay.

5519
04:43:24,710 --> 04:43:25,270
Yippee!

5520
04:43:25,590 --> 04:43:26,910
I dance, I dance.

5521
04:43:27,410 --> 04:43:29,230
Oh, I didn't have...

5522
04:43:29,230 --> 04:43:29,610
Yep.

5523
04:43:30,710 --> 04:43:31,350
That's life.

5524
04:43:32,390 --> 04:43:33,510
Welcome to life.

5525
04:43:34,170 --> 04:43:35,130
That's life.

5526
04:43:35,750 --> 04:43:36,310
I want Invis.

5527
04:43:36,410 --> 04:43:36,930
He can die.

5528
04:43:38,590 --> 04:43:39,930
That's just life.

5529
04:43:40,630 --> 04:43:41,670
Welcome to life.

5530
04:43:41,810 --> 04:43:42,530
What?

5531
04:43:44,470 --> 04:43:45,850
It is what it is.

5532
04:43:46,750 --> 04:43:47,710
One more shot.

5533
04:43:48,430 --> 04:43:49,130
No, you're not.

5534
04:43:49,250 --> 04:43:50,070
I'm aiming the ground.

5535
04:43:50,370 --> 04:43:51,570
Namor's right back in there.

5536
04:44:01,970 --> 04:44:02,730
Don't laugh!

5537
04:44:02,950 --> 04:44:04,190
Don't laugh or you die!

5538
04:44:10,460 --> 04:44:11,720
I'm on their support right now.

5539
04:44:11,780 --> 04:44:12,120
They're warmed.

5540
04:44:12,520 --> 04:44:12,880
Okay.

5541
04:44:13,580 --> 04:44:15,200
Don't laugh or you die.

5542
04:44:16,800 --> 04:44:18,620
Don't let it happen to you.

5543
04:44:22,200 --> 04:44:26,020
But it was pretty funny, you have to admit.

5544
04:44:38,600 --> 04:44:40,620
Oh my god!

5545
04:44:40,980 --> 04:44:41,520
I'm alive!

5546
04:44:43,860 --> 04:44:44,040
Alright.

5547
04:44:46,520 --> 04:44:46,880
Okay.

5548
04:44:47,960 --> 04:44:48,940
There you go.

5549
04:44:49,120 --> 04:44:49,720
Nice.

5550
04:44:57,360 --> 04:44:58,880
I'm trapped!

5551
04:45:02,980 --> 04:45:06,700
Look, that Venom was like, I got you now!

5552
04:45:07,260 --> 04:45:11,720
I'm like, now you see me, now you don't.

5553
04:45:17,840 --> 04:45:19,680
That's unlucky for the Venom.

5554
04:45:21,180 --> 04:45:23,080
That's very unlucky.

5555
04:45:29,640 --> 04:45:30,200
Woah!

5556
04:45:31,840 --> 04:45:34,080
I feel like the Namor was pretty good.

5557
04:45:45,580 --> 04:45:46,700
Alright.

5558
04:45:48,980 --> 04:45:49,460
Fizzbowl!

5559
04:45:49,620 --> 04:45:51,540
Thank you for the 100 bitties!

5560
04:45:51,740 --> 04:45:52,840
Thank you, thank you!

5561
04:45:54,380 --> 04:45:58,120
These games have definitely been interesting, but it's still fun watching you play.

5562
04:45:58,200 --> 04:46:00,540
I hope the games aren't as rough from here on out.

5563
04:46:01,360 --> 04:46:02,320
Alright, we win this.

5564
04:46:02,360 --> 04:46:03,140
I'm calling it.

5565
04:46:03,800 --> 04:46:06,700
We get our eternity back on this account and then it's...

5566
04:46:08,580 --> 04:46:10,940
I streamed longer than I was going to anyway.

5567
04:46:15,160 --> 04:46:16,400
And games have been alright.

5568
04:46:16,840 --> 04:46:20,820
It's more fun on the ult because like, I don't have to worry too much.

5569
04:46:20,920 --> 04:46:21,800
Especially if I'm soloing.

5570
04:46:21,940 --> 04:46:23,420
If I solo, I'll just play on this account.

5571
04:46:23,920 --> 04:46:27,040
I'll do like one game on main and see how games are like.

5572
04:46:27,320 --> 04:46:32,140
I play like until I lose and like, you know, it's usually it's one game.

5573
04:46:32,140 --> 04:46:43,180
I don't know how, but like, my fucking record has been like, nearly been like, I lose on character select.

5574
04:46:43,900 --> 04:46:50,440
Like both times I've played on stream, I literally lose on character select.

5575
04:46:50,600 --> 04:46:51,560
It's actually crazy.

5576
04:46:54,920 --> 04:46:59,100
It's actually... like, it's not even me.

5577
04:46:59,520 --> 04:47:03,220
It's just, I get such bad RNG in general.

5578
04:47:03,480 --> 04:47:04,300
I'm getting rid of the clone.

5579
04:47:04,720 --> 04:47:05,720
Never have the clone out.

5580
04:47:06,840 --> 04:47:09,400
What the fuck is prodigy?

5581
04:47:09,640 --> 04:47:12,040
Oh my god, he's maybe a prodigy right now.

5582
04:47:12,340 --> 04:47:13,480
It's like they all wear afk.

5583
04:47:14,500 --> 04:47:15,480
What happened?

5584
04:47:16,140 --> 04:47:18,500
Well, our fucking widow is popping off.

5585
04:47:18,500 --> 04:47:20,180
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not mad at this.

5586
04:47:21,440 --> 04:47:23,440
Okay, our widow is fucking insane.

5587
04:47:23,600 --> 04:47:25,560
I'm fucking... I'm going.

5588
04:47:26,740 --> 04:47:28,300
There's their infinite right there.

5589
04:47:29,900 --> 04:47:31,020
I'm pocketing.

5590
04:47:34,340 --> 04:47:36,140
I want this pocket.

5591
04:47:40,160 --> 04:47:41,380
I'm going in.

5592
04:47:42,000 --> 04:47:43,120
He deserves it.

5593
04:47:43,560 --> 04:47:44,560
There we go.

5594
04:47:44,560 --> 04:47:47,580
You can still win.

5595
04:47:47,700 --> 04:47:49,120
You can hold the first one and still win.

5596
04:47:49,420 --> 04:47:50,300
There we go.

5597
04:47:50,500 --> 04:47:51,440
This is it.

5598
04:47:57,490 --> 04:47:58,130
Let's go.

5599
04:47:58,210 --> 04:48:00,450
No, we don't respect 1v1s.

5600
04:48:00,590 --> 04:48:01,230
We don't.

5601
04:48:01,910 --> 04:48:05,170
We don't respect it, I guess.

5602
04:48:07,650 --> 04:48:08,130
Okay.

5603
04:48:08,830 --> 04:48:10,150
Don't worry, I got you.

5604
04:48:10,150 --> 04:48:12,290
That mag just standing there.

5605
04:48:19,470 --> 04:48:20,850
GG boys.

5606
04:48:21,590 --> 04:48:22,750
Yep, we did it.

5607
04:48:26,910 --> 04:48:28,650
Guys, I need this win.

5608
04:48:35,870 --> 04:48:37,990
What a fast round.

5609
04:48:38,090 --> 04:48:38,950
I deserve this.

5610
04:48:40,630 --> 04:48:42,870
I played really well there, guys.

5611
04:48:43,150 --> 04:48:45,210
I think I did really well in general.

5612
04:48:45,750 --> 04:48:47,490
I'm learning lowkey, guys.

5613
04:48:47,630 --> 04:48:49,330
I'm actually figuring out how to play.

5614
04:48:53,210 --> 04:48:54,970
I think... Whoa, I'm up.

5615
04:48:55,070 --> 04:48:55,310
Nice.

5616
04:48:55,450 --> 04:48:55,850
I'm up.

5617
04:48:56,150 --> 04:48:57,130
Guys, look at that.

5618
04:48:57,170 --> 04:48:58,030
I'm up one game.

5619
04:49:00,270 --> 04:49:02,110
I'm up one game.

5620
04:49:02,230 --> 04:49:02,950
Let's fucking go.

5621
04:49:02,950 --> 04:49:04,170
We're so bad.

5622
04:49:06,490 --> 04:49:08,550
Oh my god, what was my history like?

5623
04:49:08,770 --> 04:49:09,810
It wasn't that bad.

5624
04:49:10,610 --> 04:49:11,650
Not that bad.

5625
04:49:12,090 --> 04:49:14,170
I've actually started winning, too.

5626
04:49:14,750 --> 04:49:16,430
It was here that got bad.

5627
04:49:16,670 --> 04:49:18,530
It was here and then I have a positive.

5628
04:49:19,050 --> 04:49:21,710
I just lost and it was like minus... Okay, I need to know.

5629
04:49:21,750 --> 04:49:22,550
Is that guy Smurf?

5630
04:49:23,770 --> 04:49:24,650
Okay, Prodigy.

5631
04:49:25,070 --> 04:49:25,510
Prodigy.

5632
04:49:25,610 --> 04:49:26,330
Where is he?

5633
04:49:26,450 --> 04:49:27,370
Is he queuing right now?

5634
04:49:27,530 --> 04:49:28,290
Oh, he's in queue.

5635
04:49:29,890 --> 04:49:32,010
Oh, I couldn't tell.

5636
04:49:33,050 --> 04:49:35,050
Okay, let me look at the banner then.

5637
04:49:37,110 --> 04:49:37,530
Let me see.

5638
04:49:37,570 --> 04:49:39,550
I just want to see if it's... Okay.

5639
04:49:41,010 --> 04:49:41,630
Level 31.

5640
04:49:41,850 --> 04:49:42,550
Yeah, he's Smurfing.

5641
04:49:43,030 --> 04:49:43,210
Yeah.

5642
04:49:46,070 --> 04:49:46,950
Level 31.

5643
04:49:47,410 --> 04:49:49,910
Yeah, that's not your real... That's not your real ELO.

5644
04:49:49,910 --> 04:49:50,610
Yeah.

5645
04:49:53,930 --> 04:49:54,410
Yeah.

5646
04:49:55,150 --> 04:49:56,550
Anyway, guys, that was fun.

5647
04:49:56,830 --> 04:49:57,530
That was really fun.

5648
04:49:57,630 --> 04:49:59,270
I had a great time streaming today.

5649
04:50:00,130 --> 04:50:01,090
Four hours.

5650
04:50:01,430 --> 04:50:02,730
Nine more hours to go.

5651
04:50:03,610 --> 04:50:04,470
Thank you everyone for coming.

5652
04:50:04,570 --> 04:50:07,690
If you are new here, my name is Doki Bird.

5653
04:50:08,270 --> 04:50:14,650
I usually stream on YouTube, so please check me out there and subscribe to me there if you enjoyed my content.

5654
04:50:15,390 --> 04:50:21,610
If you want to support me via other means, I do have merch coming out or is out, so let me show that real quick.

5655
04:50:21,870 --> 04:50:22,930
So I do have plushies right now.

5656
04:50:22,970 --> 04:50:24,930
There's one week left on plushies, guys.

5657
04:50:25,030 --> 04:50:25,730
One more week.

5658
04:50:25,810 --> 04:50:27,270
One last week before they're gone forever.

5659
04:50:27,850 --> 04:50:31,230
You do !plush, I believe.

5660
04:50:31,470 --> 04:50:33,210
You can still pre-order your plushies.

5661
04:50:33,270 --> 04:50:35,750
We have one week left, and after that, it's gone forever!

5662
04:50:36,110 --> 04:50:36,450
Whoa!

5663
04:50:38,850 --> 04:50:43,950
And then while I still have to chill, I usually tweet out whenever I'm streaming on Twitch, so please check me out there.

5664
04:50:44,310 --> 04:50:46,410
Check me on Twitter to know when I'm streaming on Twitch.

5665
04:50:46,510 --> 04:50:51,390
I usually do Twitch streams very spontaneous and like guerrilla streams and stuff.

5666
04:50:51,650 --> 04:50:56,870
So it's usually on there when I tweet it out, and I think that's everything I want to show now.

5667
04:50:57,210 --> 04:50:58,550
All right, guys, thank you everybody for coming.

5668
04:50:58,690 --> 04:51:04,170
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get your blood flowing.

5669
04:51:04,170 --> 04:51:06,830
Any of you, except for me, head to bed, guys.

5670
04:51:06,990 --> 04:51:07,730
You deserve it.

5671
04:51:07,870 --> 04:51:09,070
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5672
04:51:09,390 --> 04:51:10,010
Bye, guys.

5673
04:51:10,450 --> 04:51:10,810
Bye!
