36
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,240
Yeah, I'm so nervous.

37
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,420
The best of one is like fucking with me right now.

38
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,100
What?

39
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,300
Best of one is the best, bro.

40
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,680
Because you guys know it's not.

41
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,580

You go in and you alt immediately.

45
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,300
You're just going as hard as possible in the first game.

46
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,320
You let them know who's winning.

47
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,640
And it's us.

48
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,500
Oh, oh.

49
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,800
The fact that you can like make a really bad misplay and then just lose and get eliminated is scaring me.

50
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,100
That's the scary part.

51
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:58,580

Wait, they have a tank.

84
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,540

85
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,960
Yo, what?

86
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,820

87
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
Oh my god, this captain's white.

88
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

89
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,960

Oh, someone's throwing.

Yeah, I was joining too.

95
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,920
I was just okay.

96
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,040
Oh, I'll join after the game.

97
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,520
That's why I'm lagging, bro.

98
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,680
That's why my shotgun is here.

99
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
I legitimately do feel like I'm lagging.

100
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:18,780
Still?

101
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,120
What?

102
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,980
Yo, back the fuck up, Emma.

103
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,200
My PSP like the Cloud Fuel servers, you know?

104
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,540
I am lagging in one.

105
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,900
Wait, have I actually lagging at first?

106
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,760
I was just trying to like make an excuse.

107
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,120
I might actually be lagging.

108
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,980
Wait, what?

109
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,240
I think my frames are just dropping to be honest.

110
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,620
It might be because of my VTuber model.

111
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,300
Yeah, no, it does that.

112
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,140
Oh yeah, I'm using Fugies only.

113
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,060
Oh, okay.

114
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,980
I'll probably do that.

115
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,920
Oh yeah, yeah.

116
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,980

118
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,120

152
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,440
He's one.

153
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:28,740
Nice.

154
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,140
We're ulting.

155
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,200
I'm sorry.

156
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,040
I got the Emma though.

157
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,160
Oh, he's anti.

158
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,720
Oh, it's fine.

159
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,740
I don't even know how to shield.

160
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,480
Oh, that's how you shield.

161
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,260
Okay, yeah, double Bubba.

162
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,860
I have Invis alt for this.

163
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,980
I've never played this guy before.

164
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,960
You can, for Invis alt, just use defensively.

165
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,900
Because they do have ultis soon by the way.

166
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,740
Do Invis first.

167
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,400
And then cloak later.

168
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,160
Okay.

169
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,340
Captain behind again.

170
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:54,880
I got you.

171
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,120

172
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,420

175
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,220
I can look him.

176
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,000
All right.

177
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,520
You're fine.

178
00:15:59,660 --> 00:15:59,780
You're fine.

179
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,080
You're fine.

180
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,980
Oh, no.

181
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,660
He's so fast.

182
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,360
I'm just a little guy.

183
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,800
I don't have any anti, so.

184
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:07,380
Oh.

185
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,200
He got these.

186
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,520
Yeah, yeah, use this.

187
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,180
Nice.

188
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,480
Oh.

189
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,580
Nice, nice, nice.

190
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,800

Oh, there's like a gambit behind.

210
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,520

211
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,080
That's fine.

212
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,680
You're fine, you're fine.

A thousand cards.

And we can use...

262
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,380
For this, if we get cloak all at first, you can use cloak all aggressively here.

263
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,540
Okay.

264
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,560

thank you awesome have fun guys see you thank you for the invite wait i had a question um are we are the two matches going simultaneously or is one match going at a time and we just all watch the match that's going on uh every match should be on stream so you can just uh yeah just watch so we're waiting oh okay yeah you can just like co-stream basically okay okay at the same time okay okay sure yeah we we enabled uh co-streaming for everyone so even on youtube should be good oh uh you you could you could like just obs it i guess no no uh co-stream for youtube but if you want to you know broadcast it it's all good yeah okay um i'll talk with production just to make sure we're good there but yeah every match should be on stream so okay okay do you okay any other questions uh do we know which team is which teams are going

309
00:20:17,000 --> 00:21:21,420
first one is um and i could find out which one i'm having production like organize the whole thing at this point um so yeah i'm i'm the event organizer so let me come back to you okay i'll be right back okay thank you okay thank you yeah no problem have fun maybe i worded those questions kind of weird we got this it's fine i don't know what that means uh yeah i don't know uh i think means we're allowed to stream it like sure like like you can stream to stream yeah okay because it's technically against the rules to stream another partner's content unless they give you explicit permission oh i didn't know that okay well it's it's one of those rules where like if you do it and the person gets mad they can report you but if no one knows then like you know yeah it's like how you know the game awards they make you apply to co-stream it yeah it's just that so like but you know other people you know they can't catch everyone so a big streamer they can't catch you right right right all right

310
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:36,080
i'm ready this time i'm excited yeah let's do we can have a doing another quick match yeah we can we can i think we can right i mean we can all just leave afterwards worst case scenario we back out it's fine oh yeah we're already in

00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,430
I'm low, I'm low.

507
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,030
Thank you.

508
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,170
I heard the death ult.

509
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,070
I'm scared.

510
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,450
Extermination.

511
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,270
You can all for this?

512
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,070
I got two.

513
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

514
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:03,810
Oh, this?

515
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:04,610
Nice.

516
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,010
This last fight anyway.

517
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,670
I don't think they're going to portal in quickly, guys.

518
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,410
You don't know.

519
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:13,950
You don't know.

520
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,930
You never know.

521
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,110
Sometimes I do it.

522
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,050
I wanted to be there.

523
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,690
Guys, wait for me.

524
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,510
Don't end without me.

525
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,510
Please don't end without me.

526
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,630
Please don't end without me.

527
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,190
Well, I'm starting in 10 seconds.

528
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,190
Oh, okay.

529
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,590
Yeah, but aren't you doing an interview first?

530
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,570
So, no, Machas aren't starting right away unless you guys want to watch at the beginning.

531
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,580
God, Gambit's so cool.

532
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,120
God, he is.

533
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,080
He's so cool.

534
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,700
They're going to nerf him next season.

535
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,400
There's no way.

536
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,160
Oh, no.

537
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,580
No way.

538
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,580
He survives this one.

539
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,520
No.

540
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:49,700
No.

541
00:30:49,820 --> 00:31:24,260
Like, the current top 500 is, like, majority Gambit layers it's really that makes sense it's so dumb that's crazy what why is he so cool it's because he has a very loving wife and he's like a house husband have you seen the picture of her grabbing the back of his jacket and like dragging him off and it just is manhandled there's one you know like the motorcycle thing like she's actually like he's like the the little spoon in them on the motorcycle oh of course he is yeah and rose the one driving the motorcycle that's crazy I need that.

542
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,600
He has his own dummy mommy.

543
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,160
Like he's living the life.

544
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,600
Can I heal this time?

545
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,660
Yeah.

546
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,940
Actually, yo, yo healers go GPS.

547
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,480
So this is important.

548
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,940
Who are the good healers?

549
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,260
All right.

550
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,740
All right.

551
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,320
I got this.

552
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:45,780
All right.

553
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,540
I got this first time gaming.

554
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:46,940
No problem.

555
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,720
Oh, you got it.

556
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,840
Am I the okay?

557
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,420
We have two healers.

558
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:52,660
All right.

559
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,220
We got this.

560
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,360
I mean, you guys can run triple Subway.

561
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,440
We can always go three.

562
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,320
Yeah, yeah, that's the plan.

563
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,440
I can just go all healers.

564
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,000
Let me just go ahead.

565
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,320
Let me just hit F1 real quick.

566
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:01,940
Okay, let's see.

567
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,600
Each card detonates.

568
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,820
It either heals or does damage.

569
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,660
Okay, okay, that's simple.

570
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,800
I can shield myself now.

571
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,880
This is like life changing.

572
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,440
Whoa.

573
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:11,760
Race.

574
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,240
Okay, that's a big heal for everybody.

575
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,240
Oh, and it's a chain heal.

576
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay, okay, okay.

577
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,000
Sometimes I wish we could go back.

578
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,090
Got me a chunk of Cronovium that says we can't.

579
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,520
Oh, yeah, I'm going Loki.

580
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,500
Oh, okay.

581
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,060
Three, two, one.

582
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,620
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

583
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,400
All right,

584
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,520

585
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,040

Side lock anymore.

593
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,960
Oh, please break the squirrels.

594
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,100
Hello, Invis.

595
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,160

I'm sorry.

601
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,720
Oh, they have a magic now.

602
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,260
This deserves your attention.

603
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,140
There we go.

604
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,800
You got it.

605
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,140
Nice tool.

606
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,320
Look at that.

607
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,180
Now that our support started healing again.

608
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:03,840
Okay.

609
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,420
I just cracked 2K healing.

610
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,600
I'm a little proud of myself.

611
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,700
Now you know how we feel.

612
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,600
I don't talk to you guys like this.

613
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,360
I'm at 2K.

614
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,080
What you rocking with?

615
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,400

I'm giving you the rank experience.

617
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,680
Oh, I might need to catch up.

618
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,180
Oh.

619
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,260
Oh.

620
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,460
Thank you guys.

621
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,380
I'm so scared.

622
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,020
I'm dead.

623
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,580
What the fuck?

624
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,120
Nice.

625
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,440
I'm going for the fantastic.

626
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,160
There you go.

627
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,100
There's a squirrel up there!

628
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,340
She's assaulting me!

629
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,100
Me looking at a tree.

630
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm at a public park.

631
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,940
I'm back here.

632
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,920
I'm not done killing you.

633
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:53,880
Whoa.

634
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,020
I'm gonna make a name on myself.

635
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,320
I'm about to make a name for myself here.

636
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,100
I'm about to make a name for myself in this place.

637
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,270
Oh, don't be waiting for this.

638
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,020
Oh, shit.

639
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,580
You don't know how long I've been waiting for this.

640
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,100
Oh, don't I've been waiting for this.

641
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,860
Wait, guys, there's a magic in it right behind us.

642
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,420
You guys are just getting backshotted by a magic.

643
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,320
I think that was a little bit excessive.

644
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,300
Uh-oh.

645
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:22,900
Um...

646
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,800
We're doing it.

647
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,260
I thought that was the second round.

648
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,860
I popped all.

649
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,940
Oh, well, it's okay.

650
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,760
You're MVP, so, like, you could do whatever you want.

651
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,900
Okay, thanks, guys.

652
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:42,740
I'm never mean to my healers, because I started playing healer, and I don't like yelling at them.

653
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,060
That's crazy.

654
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,100
I feel like I'm just training your mental.

655
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,380
I'm training your mental.

656
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,000
I never say that to people.

657
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,920
Training your mental is insane.

658
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,420
Oh, my God.

659
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,180
I'm making sure you'll live past the ring.

660
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

661
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,060
You think what I say is bad?

662
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,840
Get ready to get to plat.

663
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,240
Okay, ma'am.

664
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,040
Yes, ma'am.

665
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,600
And then it gets worse.

666
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,520
The higher the rank, the worse the...

667
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,140
No, I actually feel like ever since I got...

668
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,960
Like, ever since I started playing a diamond, like, it's, like, a lot better.

669
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,880
The people were worse in silver.

670
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,360
No, no, no, no.

671
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,200
The worst I had was when I started diamond.

672
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,060
That was where everyone just had mics and would not learn how to both shut up and not say bad words.

673
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,220
The higher I've gotten, the more people are, like...

674
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:57,020
like actually like willing to play the game i like silver a lot because there would just be people like talking to their parents in the background hello goodbye guys my frames are dropping it feels like oh no this map is this map is known as the worst map for frames oh guys guys yes there's three different ones on us freaking magic oh come here hello Oh,

675
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,240

676
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,180
Where?

677
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,620
Oh, cool.

678
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,220
Watch out.

679
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,660
Watch out.

680
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,020
Wait, okay.

681
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,120
And Silver, can they give you the gamer words?

682
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,740
Um, yeah.

683
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,740
Oh, okay.

684
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,060
It's just the same then.

685
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,960
Yeah, it's the same.

686
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:17,660
Yeah.

687
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,840
I mean, there are many.

688
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,400
Whoa, I'm gonna...

689
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,060

692
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,440

693
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,220
As she should.

694
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,220
Oh, we're supposed to go see the other one.

695
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,500
Wait, cap, cap, cap.

696
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,120
You are on a solo adventure.

697
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,060
Oh, wait.

698
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,300
Oh, I like that.

699
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,740
And then I hit shift and a right click again.

700
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,560
Oh, I'm free.

701
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,240
Oh, my God.

702
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,780
And then I hit Q.

703
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,960
Oh, my God.

704
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,960
There's a man.

705
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,760
He loves America.

706
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,420

They used Inviscerity.

709
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,880
And then I hit it again, and then it does the heal.

710
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,400
Oh!

711
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,360
Okay, but don't get blown up, though.

712
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
I thought he was just counting the...

713
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:06,820
I'm just...

714
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,000
What the hell?

715
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,700
Extermination.

716
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,700
Where am I?

717
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,620
Get down from there.

718
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,200
I've been asking myself for it.

719
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,580
What?

720
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
I've been asking myself that for a long time.

721
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:19,680
Oh!

722
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Hey, I'm not gonna lie.

723
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,640
I just really don't feel...

724
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,080
I don't really feel that safe here.

725
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,200
I'm not even gonna lie.

726
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Oh my god, it sucks because their supports are healing their teammates, but I don't know what that feels like.

727
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,560
Oh my god, the shade is insane.

728
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,300
That's true, you don't, because you died too fast for me to heal you.

729
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,120
Heal step back a little bit, come on.

730
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,120
Oh, you guys are in there.

731
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:44,920
Oh, shoot.

732
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,320
Oh, I am so scared.

733
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,000
There is a heal.

734
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,620
Where is my damage?

735
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,580
Where is my damage?

736
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,940
Oh my god, the DPS has healed.

737
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,940
I don't know.

738
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,600
I'm so scared.

739
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,640
Guys, I'm so scared.

740
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,400
There's a man.

741
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,900
Respawn faster.

742
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,620
I don't understand.

743
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm alive.

744
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,300
I got a triple kill.

745
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,180
I'm ace.

746
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,640
I can see whatever I want because I'm ace.

747
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,020
That's true.

748
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,220
Oh, shit.

749
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:07,620
Okay.

750
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,280
My bad.

751
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,900
Holy shit.

752
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:14,020
I swapped to cloak and dagger because I have a hard time keeping track of you, Yuzu.

753
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,380
You're so high.

754
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,160
Oh, yeah.

755
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,520
When you first storm, you just gotta play like Luna or cloak and dagger.

756
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

757
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,580
I'm definitely trying to stay a bit lower.

758
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,500
They're pointing forward.

759
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,120
Yeah, no, no.

760
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,600
You do not want to stay lower.

761
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,580
No, go higher.

762
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,000
Oh, they're the top.

763
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,000
Go to the top.

764
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,080
They're the top.

765
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,320
They're there.

766
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,140
I can- I can cloak this.

767
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:33,840
Cloaking.

768
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,240
You- you, uh, yeah.

769
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,180
A-ah, a-ah.

770
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,960
That's crazy.

771
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,380
But I'm alive.

772
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,580
That's crazy.

773
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,360
Yo, the sun's in my eyes at 9 o'clock at night.

774
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:47,900
I swear.

775
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,830
I was alive.

776
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,400
But I was alive.

777
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,100
What happened?

778
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,280
I think I think I was legitimately just a little bit too far from it.

779
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
No, I left clicked.

780
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,900
I just stopped begging to hit you in the front of the car.

781
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,180
Oh, well then, oh.

782
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,680
Wait, was that my fault?

783
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,060
Why didn't you stop me from left clicking?

784
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,820
Yeah, honestly true.

785
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:11,860
My bad.

786
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,100
That could have been avoided.

787
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,260
It's okay.

788
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:15,680
It's okay.

789
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,740
All sports after the first time.

790
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,680
Somebody draw her just kicking us.

791
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,560

Don't worry, I have experience healing.

794
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,500
How can we die if we're running triple support?

795
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,280
I have two games of experience in healing.

796
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,480
I got this.

797
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,020
I just, I'm out of practice.

798
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,220
I've been doing something else for a while.

799
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,480
Bubble in that corner.

800
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,320
I'm going to get high ground.

801
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,360
You're with me.

807
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah.

808
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:57,760
Yeah.

809
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:03,400
It was like, yeah, like a five minute cameo and that's all everyone remembers it because of it.

810
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,820
Fucking Deadpool, bro.

811
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,260
It's so awesome.

812
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,640
Oh, this does heal you guys.

813
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,260
I don't know how long I've been waiting for this.

814
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,400
I probably should have been spamming that more often than.

815
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,180
It's okay.

816
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:14,600
Okay.

817
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,260
Oh, he's up.

818
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,680
Oh, no.

819
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,720
Where's our res?

820
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,840
Oh, there it is.

821
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,320
I got there.

822
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:22,740
I don't have res.

823
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,180
I don't have res.

824
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,560
I don't have res.

825
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,460
I need her.

826
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,260
Oh, goodbye.

827
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:25,760
I'm holding.

828
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,560
I'm holding.

829
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,020
I'm holding.

830
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,820
I'm holding this.

831
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,180
You know, it's fine.

832
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:31,580
It's okay.

833
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,260
We still got point.

834
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,360
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,340
Oh, fuck.

836
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:34,580
Okay.

837
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,560
I can't quote this.

838
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,340
Did she do it?

839
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,320
Oh, she did it.

840
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,060
Oh, she did it.

841
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:40,940
Oh, my God.

842
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:41,780
She did it too.

843
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,820
I did it the fatherly true.

844
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,960
My fucking god.

845
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,620
I'm just saying you did it again.

846
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,620
She did it again.

847
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,780
I was on your side.

848
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,140
What are you fighting with me?

849
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:51,640
Oh.

850
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,520
Oh.

851
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,700
That's so awesome.

852
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,920
She's just trying to be supportive, man.

853
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,280
I can't aim.

854
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:02,580
We get strange.

855
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,280
We get strange.

856
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:04,520
It's okay.

857
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:04,960
Me too.

858
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,740
I'm so used to a gambit aim that I'm having trouble adjusting.

859
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,300

865
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,460
We did a gambit first.

867
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,820

871
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,210
Promptly at 4.

872
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,850
I think that's what I said, right now.

873
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,130
They're still starting.

874
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,430
Or I guess we can play another?

875
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,170
Or do we not risk it?

876
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:13,590
Hello.

877
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:14,830
Where is our...

878
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,070
Where is our...

879
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,330
Where is our king?

880
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm going to use the bathroom real quick.

881
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,620
Sorry, one second.

882
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:23,740
Okay, okay.

883
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,300
So that we can...

884
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,200
I see the co-stream thing on Iron Mouse's channel.

885
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,400
So we all have to open up the co-stream?

886
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,520
I guess because it links the mainstream.

887
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,420
If you click the co-streaming thing.

888
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,580
Oh, okay, okay.

889
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,340
Okay.

890
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,600
Yeah, our game is the second one after this because they're streaming it.

891
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,960
Yeah, my chat's asking about it.

892
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,280
They're streaming it like back to back.

893
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,600
They're not streaming it simultaneously.

894
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:56,300
Yeah.

895
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:07,140
Oh my gosh, from these quick play games, I'm going to play way too impressive on Gambit.

896
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,100
Join Coastream?

897
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:25,380
These quick play games, they're very risky because competitive Gambit is so different from Quick Play Gambit because I know I'm better than like cross players, so I'm doing the dumb shit.

898
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,500
I am now co-streaming with them also.

899
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:37,320
I am also co-streaming, but I don't know what it Oh, it just makes it so that when you click on you click on your channel, it links them directly to what stream you're watching.

900
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:38,720
Oh, okay.

901
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,900
Yeah, yeah.

902
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,200
Oh, wait.

903
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,220
That's so cool.

904
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:42,720
Yeah.

905
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,360
So they're like, Oh, what are they watching?

906
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,960
You're like, oh, it's Seedog's channel.

907
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,260
Oh, it shows them with like everyone.

908
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,260
Yeah.

909
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,280
Because they're like, oh, this is the main broadcast.

910
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,720
Oh, they're starting.

911
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,220
Oh, they're starting.

912
00:48:59,220 --> 00:48:59,540
They're starting.

913
00:48:59,680 --> 00:48:59,900
They're starting.

914
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,720
Okay, okay.

915
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,640
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to check.

916
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,340
We watch.

917
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,400
Yeah, I'm watching.

918
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,940
The main broadcast doesn't have it yet because I assume there's a delay, but they're showing what they're playing.

919
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,780
So if I go to her and then hit the button.

920
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,200
Do we just watch her?

921
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,960
I'm just watching what the comps are playing.

922
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,200
Oh, co-streaming.

923
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,760
Oh.

924
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:25,780
How does this work?

925
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,040
How do we get in this?

926
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,280
Start coaching.

927
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,560
You just click it.

928
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,540
I don't see it.

929
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,800
Oh, that thing.

930
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,620
This thing.

931
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,220
Okay.

932
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:34,220
Yeah.

933
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:34,840
Yeah.

934
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:34,940
Okay.

935
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,740
I'm watching.

936
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:37,700
Hmm.

937
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,520
Does it show it on our streams or how does this work?

938
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:40,800
Yeah.

939
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,040
Chad, do y'all see it?

940
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,900
No, I think it just says who's in the stream.

941
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,460
I mean, there is sign.

942
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,660
Oh, so then I still got to pull it out and put an OBS.

943
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,820
I'm showing the teams now.

944
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:53,120
Okay.

945
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,220
I just want to make sure because I didn't want it to like double up.

946
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,440
They are doing.

947
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,100
Yeah, for sure.

948
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,880
For sure.

949
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:47,860
running okay i'm gonna look at my notes too as well i don't know they're actually running triple support sorry maybe the side last minute is that a hawk eye i see yeah they swap oh yeah they're running oh never mind yeah you're right i knew they're gonna that's the thing they're gonna run hell and the more they don't get siloed but is that hell in the more map i don't know oh wait i wait i do know i have the i have the cheat sheet the cheat sheet it is that's not that's not an actual hell in the more map the

950
00:50:51,920 --> 00:51:08,960
doobster someone's like siloed bad and big season for it bro these guys do not know how fucking broken silo she's so scary i felt so i felt so bad because I saw Duby kept asking to run scrims, and we were, like, busy, and I was like, I felt really bad.

951
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,000
I wanted to.

952
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:10,840
Yeah.

953
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,080
I think, like, scrims, you don't...

954
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,380
Or maybe she's trying to get intel.

955
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:21,260
Yeah, the thing is, normally, people don't scrim with the people within the tournament, because, like, you know, the intel.

956
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,600
So, like, in pro-play, any teams just scrim EU teams.

957
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,940
So they don't, like, leak the intel.

958
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,600
Oh, that's interesting.

959
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,880
Or they scrim teams against, like, teams that didn't qualify, basically.

960
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:55,340
i've uh i've learned a lot just uh experiencing like scrim stuff i've never done stuff like this it's kind of cool it's really cool it's a very foreign world to to me i've not played pro esports esports is awesome when you do fgc because it's not even esports it's you and like 10 dudes in a bar playing

961
00:52:00,020 --> 00:53:11,760
do you remember the one year of um twitch con in vegas where we went to that bar and the bar had caught on the on the big tvs oh what i must have missed that no you were there you got me a drink at that party i'm gonna tell you that i'm gonna tell that everyone should know i was not there at twitch.com no no no i was physically i was yeah no i guess it's vegas and every shot was like seven bucks no bro i woke up and just damn yeah no thank god there's pre-gaming and then there's like pre-warfare and he was he was deep in the trenches both of them are running it hella no more oh my god and then i had the world's worst hangover for crazy yeah i say we've been well i hella for me is more of an issue than no more is yeah but we can't we can't yeah we don't we don't have we don't have the space for it yeah that's why it sucks that it's killing so hard i know it's just running everyone over that's what I'm saying yeah they need to they need to POV SK right now I need to see because because

962
00:53:11,760 --> 00:54:00,340
like if you focus SK their team can still just hit you that's the problem it's not like everyone else doesn't know how to play she plays every hero at a high level focus her either because well Yan's gonna beat you in the back of the head also it's just not enough bands if it was like if it was uh MR um I guess like the tournament bands then you can because there's enough bands because you get three bands in tournament play but it's but we don't get three bands like we need we actually need three bands but we don't get three bands but i think if they went turn advanced versus because i know they're like oh but we want them to have oh she's not missing we want them to have fun but like um there's just so many characters there's too many characters to have like ring bands in a competitive environment

963
00:54:03,900 --> 00:55:06,500
limited hero pool yeah yeah blur stop fighting and run gang what are you doing oh god the sk flank yeah that's what you guys have to be aware of the thing is you have to be aware of too like she will do that because every good neighbor player will be so loud okay watching us if we can non-stop yeah if we can we need to just keep our comms like as clear as possible so we can hear she is just mark it for me i will anti her and then like we just got killer instantly like we have to just get a turn on her yeah because like drink some water if you haven't don't get dehydrated and get a headache hey no i think amelie's team is very strong they are just because they have just because like sk itself is like a hard carry i think that's insane on um dubie's team who is the one we have to watch out for Dubee's team,

964
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,200
I would just say is Blur.

965
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,400
Blur.

966
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,600
Blur is a...

967
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,240
Blur is a FPS all-rounder.

968
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,000
He's on everything.

969
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,340
Yeah, and also he used to be a top 500.

970
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,140
I mean, he still is.

971
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,740
He's Predator, top 500 Apex.

972
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,500
And he's always been consistently high rank.

973
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:23,760
Okay.

974
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,980
So, like, you know, it has the FPS.

975
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,340
The thing is, the good thing about Triple Support is that it tilts DPS players.

976
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,140
because it's so hard to kill.

977
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:46,140
But Helena Moore allows the Namur to basically try and kill one of the supports that we just have.

978
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,140
Also, are they lagging?

979
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,060
Do you see her pain?

980
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:48,500
Yeah, yeah.

981
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,400
Do you see her pain?

982
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:49,860
They're lagging.

983
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:50,880
They're lagging.

984
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,380
The packet loss, man.

985
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,180
Are they...

986
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,520
Are...

987
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,420
It's like...

988
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,240
Are their POVs lagging too, or is just the spectator?

989
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,820
I'm not sure.

990
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,820
I think it's the POVs.

991
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,020
Yeah, I don't...

992
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:02,620
I don't have the...

993
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,040
It's...

994
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,760
We've been having...

995
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,380
We've been...

996
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,340
The Cloudflare...

997
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,700
like down thing has been really impacting like our practices and stuff as well yeah

998
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:25,660
oh they're lagging too they should pause it pause the game if they're lagging too do they know that that's a thing you can do eski knows it i don't she she knows that you can pause it so

999
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:42,690
they should just she might not need it i'm genuinely scared of sk like yeah That's why we have to get sidewalk out.

1000
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,690
Dude, she's going to clip farm us.

1001
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,030
No, no, no, no, no.

1002
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,230
It's fine.

1003
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:55,670
The thing is, we just get rid of, we, as soon as we turn, like if she flanks, she's fucked, because we all just turn on her.

1004
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,750
As long as we all turn on her, we're fine.

1005
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,090
And then also, she can lose.

1006
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,290
If she has a health bar, it can hit zero.

1007
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,790
Yeah.

1008
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,410
Like, all we have to do is just turn on her.

1009
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:06,710
It's not humanly possible.

1010
00:57:08,550 --> 00:58:16,810
Well, she's built different, so so are we so scary the power of friendship listen you might not be able to out mechanic her but you can out skill her with your team yeah because it's a team game yeah it's a power of friendship it's okay we have these track to make it a 5v6 remember that guys right we have we can make it a 5v6 easily okay okay uh dubious dubious team banned hawkeye and uh siloac and then yeah i don't know chef i think they've been siloed to target they tried to target as k yeah it's not worth it she's gonna play something else and whoop your ass anyways no no no silo bed is worth it it is no no yes i understand that but the hawkeye i don't understand why they banned hawkeye because they know that heavenly's here yeah that was that was for me oh my god the solo ulti was insane but look look right now she's throwing everything she's got at them no one has died on enemy team Yeah,

1011
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:19,230
because triple support is literally triple support.

1012
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,530
Yeah, but as I'm saying, you can still out.

1013
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:22,350
Hunter's her skin.

1014
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:23,730
Also, yeah.

1015
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:29,190
I'm going to type something in chat that like type something in chat real quick.

1016
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,450
Where's the thing?

1017
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,550
There's so much apps on screen.

1018
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,010
So much apps.

1019
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:37,750
I really like this skin, actually.

1020
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,110
It's purple noises.

1021
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,570
Oh, interesting.

1022
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,890
Oh, y'all got to make that breakable.

1023
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:47,510
Yeah, yeah, you see.

1024
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:48,770
That's got to be.

1025
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,190
That was heartbreaking to see just now.

1026
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:53,450
Like, look at the what I typed in chat.

1027
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,130
OK, give me a second.

1028
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:06,810
Yeah, so this falls apart.

1029
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:07,630
I was watching this game in 480.

1030
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:12,350
Their comp instantly falls apart if we just see that.

1031
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:13,030
Nauru Hodo.

1032
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:15,770
Nauru Hodo.

1033
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,730
Nauru Hodo.

1034
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:18,250
Nauru Hodo.

1035
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:20,330
Watashiwa.

1036
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,330
Okay, Blur, let's see it.

1037
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,130
Come on, just one, just one, just one.

1038
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:29,850
We're about to see it.

1039
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:30,310
There's another.

1040
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,050
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1041
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,790
Come on, Blur, one more.

1042
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:35,930
Holy shit.

1043
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,090
Oh, oh, again?

1044
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,430
He just needs, he got two supports.

1045
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:39,970
He got two supports, a third.

1046
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:40,590
Somebody stop him.

1047
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:42,970
And that's overtime.

1048
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:44,910
Oh, my God.

1049
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,390
That's my boy.

1050
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:49,930
If, when, when if they run Bucky, we have to swap off Loki.

1051
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:51,690
Oh, yeah.

1052
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:52,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1053
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:52,910
That's one.

1054
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:54,430
That's great.

1055
00:59:55,990 --> 01:00:41,420
invis yeah you guys have to swap between the two i can film okay cam i will be right back yeah all good um oh my gosh not to add a delay for your upcoming match surprise sk didn't swap bucky i just think sk is just really strong on the more right now with not the yeah with the hella because she's really strong with the hella and then i also just think she's such a like all-rounder capable player like she's very confident her team up enables sk with that added anti-heal like she could just burst anyone she wants yeah

1056
01:00:49,160 --> 01:01:01,500
and they're like make sure to go to the bathroom before you're before we start your game yeah i'm gonna use the restroom my favorite back guys oh it's almost over it's almost our turn no they have They have to do this.

1057
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,800
Yeah, it's only one more round.

1058
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,540
One more round is like maybe 10 minutes.

1059
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,620
I'm going to pee.

1060
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,260
That's not good.

1061
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:07,100
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

1062
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:07,620
Go ahead.

1063
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,440
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1064
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,480
That wasn't for you.

1065
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,000
I was just, I thought it was going to go longer.

1066
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:12,640
All right.

1067
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,560
I'm just looking up what we have to ban here.

1068
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,300
Oh, we're going to show this team here.

1069
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,820
I think, I think we just, I think we just let you ban and like, uh, not complicate it with.

1070
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:23,460
Yeah, yeah.

1071
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,560
I just need to make sure that we're not on an Angela map.

1072
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,700
Yeah, let me see what they're playing on attack defense.

1073
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,740
Yep, they're doing Naimore again.

1074
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:40,730
Damn.

1075
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,070
Bucky Punisher.

1076
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:45,430
Blur is nasty.

1077
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:46,590
See the score, no?

1078
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,450
Yeah, it's just a, like, you know, like, it's just a shooter.

1079
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:50,510
Yeah.

1080
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,350
It's like...

1081
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:53,150
The score's at the top.

1082
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:54,610
It's zero and two right now.

1083
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,870
Or you mean, like, the scoreboard?

1084
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:57,930
Yeah.

1085
01:01:58,290 --> 01:01:58,610
No.

1086
01:01:59,570 --> 01:01:59,990
Man.

1087
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:04,940
Like, Blur knows.

1088
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,860
The moment, he just needs to target Yanners.

1089
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:14,300
He's like, he's confident that he is a better player than Yanners because he's been playing FPS for his entire life.

1090
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:15,320
Yeah.

1091
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,540
And then the moment, you know, you got, they got a pick and then it's just over.

1092
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,760
I played Apex against him once he ran my shit and I was like, alright, I get it.

1093
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,180
I get it, man.

1094
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,300
That's crazy.

1095
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,260
Some of you are just built differently.

1096
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,390
I hope we're not the back-to-back match.

1097
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:45,990
I hope one of us has to be the back-to-back match Yeah, what does that mean?

1098
01:02:46,130 --> 01:03:00,830
It means like after our game, we have to play another game with someone Oh my god, but it's either us or Chido that has to do it That's the thing, so I hope He's nasty, did you see that shit?

1099
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:11,150
Yeah, oh my god What happened did blur like he just got a penta Yeah, that's just bucky up That's why like if we know they have a bucky up out for it.

1100
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,790
We can't like, we gotta like hold it.

1101
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:13,310
Yeah, for sure.

1102
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:16,290
Yeah, we gotta coordinate the supportals.

1103
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:19,710
We need to know you guys should figure out who's going first and who's holding.

1104
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:22,190
Okay, okay.

1105
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,620
I need to look at my... Alright.

1106
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,260
Oh yeah, I need to copy my notes here.

1107
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,120
So whenever we need to ban Hella Nemore and whenever we need to ban Angela.

1108
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,260
Actually, yeah.

1109
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,520
I don't know if I should waste a ban on Angela, but Groot.

1110
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,040
We'll see.

1111
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,580
It depends on the map.

1112
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,240
Uh-uh.

1113
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,620
I am Groot.

1114
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:51,580
Okay.

1115
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,480
I am Groot.

1116
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,300
Oh.

1117
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,820
Oh, you're doing it again.

1118
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,000
Oh, it's so nasty.

1119
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,840
Wait, I think I literally...

1120
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,560
I hate it so much.

1121
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,780
I think just don't have a support ult for it.

1122
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:08,680
They literally don't.

1123
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,940
They're running all...

1124
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,740
They had a dubby ult for it.

1125
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,740
They had a cloak and dagger, but I think she might be dead.

1126
01:04:15,140 --> 01:05:29,880
no no i meant um i meant the blur's all they literally don't have like they just don't save alts for uh bucky oh yeah i'm not closing it either almost team is just an invis and uh and a gambit yeah they ran double sub they didn't run triple support if they ran triple support i think like yeah they could have held yeah no yeah full full respect blur is insane he's just correct oh for sure yeah this is actually crazy i thought like i don't know honestly thought that SK's team was going to win this so this is very putting up a very significant fight but I just blur yeah he really locked in at the last second holy shit I'm back oh my god what did I say gang what did I say even gods can bleed they can bleed I told you should never get to your head you know what you're that's the case we change our bands then okay the thing is do you want to okay i'll type it i'll type it here okay okay

1141
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:51,880

I can't see it.

1154
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,820
It's in tournament room.

1155

1158
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,420

Okay, I'm going to check the map what they're playing on.

1163
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,940
Can I show this lobby or no?

1164
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:23,340

01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,700
I listen to MR Music.

1176
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,260
I am ready.

1177
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,000
What is that?

1178
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,320
The MR Bible is music.

1179
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,220
Oh.

1180
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,080
I like, feel like I look, you need it.

1181
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,560
I need to enter my flow state.

1182
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,350
Because like I can.

1183
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,630
It's just, I gotta, actually, I might, hold on.

1184
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:58,390
You know what?

1185
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,230
No, because listening to music makes me stupid.

1186
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:03,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1187
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:04,310
You know what?

1188
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:04,670
You're right.

1191
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,930
Oh, it's not doing the thing where...

1192
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:40,670
We are escorting.

1193
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,490
So this is...

1194
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:45,090
Do you guys want to ban Sylock or Penny?

1195
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:47,310
Um...

1196
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:52,830
I feel like Penny is a pretty good at holding.

1197
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:53,790
So maybe...

1198
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:54,730
Yeah, this is a...

1199
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:56,910
It's like a convoy to...

1200
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:57,890
They took your...

1201
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:58,610
They took Gambit.

1202
01:09:59,250 --> 01:09:59,690
That's fine.

1203
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:00,350
Then we have our...

1204
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:00,990
So what are we running?

1205
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:02,590
We're running Mr. Fantastic.

1206
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:03,730
Uh...

1207
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:04,430

1209
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:36,710
Life energy is a powerful weapon.

1210
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:38,650
So Loki, Mantis, and then who was the third supporter?

1211
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,530
It was either Invis or Luna.

1212
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:42,210
Okay.

1213
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:44,430
Can you hear us now?

1214
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:45,650
Yeah, I can, but...

1215
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:46,530
Yeah, I like that.

1216
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,530
I think Invis is better though, isn't it?

1217
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,930
I mean, Balila can't hear us or something.

1218
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,010
Oh, it can.

1219
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,930
Okay, I can request pause.

1220
01:10:58,890 --> 01:10:59,330
Oh.

1221
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,290
RTC connecting.

1222
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:02,750
Pause, please.

1223
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:05,990
for our team.

1224
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,630
We can't change the server someone, one of the admins would have to.

1225
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,690
I would just reload this screen.

1226
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,430
I can't initiate pause.

1227
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,610
Pause, please.

1228
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,830
I'll do like...

1229
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:27,590
I'll do at...

1230
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:28,030
Can you at?

1231
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:28,430
Okay.

1232
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,050
At Alex.

1233
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:31,870
Pause.

1234
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:34,650
We don't have this.

1235
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:34,950
squared.

1236
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:36,270
Okay, there you go.

1237
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:37,350
All right.

1238
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,270
Danka.

1239
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:48,430
Of course, Discord fails on our friend saying is they're saying restart Discord.

1240
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:52,030
Oh, wait.

1241
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:57,370
We have several players that can't they can't list here.

1242
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:58,570
Okay.

1243
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:01,190
Oh, even on Shoto's team?

1244
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:02,530
No, for us.

1245
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:04,670
We have several?

1246
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:05,850
Okay, I put...

1247
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:06,570
Oh, okay, we're fine.

1248
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:07,750
Is everyone okay?

1249
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:09,310
Yeah, I'm here.

1250
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:09,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1251
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:11,290
How about kick you?

1252
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:12,450
I'm here, I'm here.

1253
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:13,130
Okay, we're good.

1254
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:13,550
All right.

1255
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,390
Let's just do our...

1256
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:16,850
Yeah, let's test manager close it.

1257
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:17,790
All right.

1258
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:18,390
Okay, okay.

1259
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:21,550
Do you want Emma or...

1260
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:22,410
Is it Emma or...

1261
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:22,630
Mag Emma?

1262
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,750
We do Mag Emma.

1263
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:24,970
Okay, got it, got it, got it.

1264
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:25,550
Ready?

1265
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,450
Oh, thank God they don't give me the other button.

1266
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:28,550
Oh, my God.

1267
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:31,510
Let's get the shit out of me when I did that.

1268
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:32,690
Okay, yeah.

1269
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,320
I got a new skin.

1270
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:39,760
Check it out.

1271
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:40,980
Nice.

1272
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,500
That's tough, twin.

1273
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:43,760
Thank you, twin.

1274
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,200
It's tough, twin.

1275
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,360
You look good, twin.

1276
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,160
Damn.

1277
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:50,980
Okay.

1278
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,180
Thanks, ladies.

1279
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,860
You had a 5% all charge, idiot.

1280
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,380
They're playing really deep.

1281
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,360
There's a name more in the back.

1282
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,720
We got some range to hit those squids because I can't.

1283
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:03,520
Okay, I got it.

1284
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,300
Pushing up.

1285
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,800
I have such one.

1286
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,140
You bubbled.

1287
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:09,640
Go ahead, get in.

1288
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,860
Let's go pushing up.

1289
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:14,820
I'm going to push you.

1290
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:15,820
We can get Mag.

1291
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,900
Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag.

1292
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:17,720
Mag, Mag, Mag.

1293
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,300
Put in pressure on the healer.

1294
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,060
Got him, got him.

1295
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:19,620
Nice.

1296
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,480
I'm literally just on the healer.

1297
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:22,240
I'm just on the healer.

1298
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:22,920
They're not paying attention.

1299
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,120
Oh my god.

1300
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,000
I got you.

1301
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:25,440
I got you.

1302
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:26,820
I'm coming.

1303
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:27,240
I'm coming.

1304
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,000
They're at the top.

1305
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:29,760
They're at the top.

1306
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,240
They're at the top.

1307
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,400
They're at the top.

1308
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:31,520
They're at the top.

1309
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,740
Focus on.

1310
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,280
Focus support.

1311
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:34,740
Focus support.

1312
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:35,720
Look at it.

1313
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,240
Look at it.

1314
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:36,420
Look at it.

1315
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:41,940
Focus back, focus back.

1316
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:42,400
Got him!

1317
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,020
Hold up top.

1318
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:43,640
I'll hold up here.

1319
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:44,760
Hold up here.

1320
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:45,420
Hold up.

1321
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:45,620
Hold up.

1322
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:46,900
She's not going to throw her life away.

1323
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,420
Nice kill, nice kill.

1324
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:50,900
Good take.

1325
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,100
This auto, this auto pushes.

1326
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:54,840
Push up, push up.

1327
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,420
This auto pushes.

1328
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:59,340
So any VPS just get in her face and she starts just fucking like whipping the water.

1329
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,240
They auto pushes.

1330
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:00,880
I got you.

1331
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,320
I got you.

1332
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:01,740
Pushing.

1333
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,480
I think I'll have a freeze.

1334
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:04,760
Yeah, yeah.

1335
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,880
All right.

1336
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,680
Even if you just use it for defensive.

1337
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,000
We use mine for aggressive.

1338
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,280
Back up.

1339
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:11,600
Back up.

1340
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,680
I'll use what they use.

1341
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,140
10 seconds.

1342
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,720
I think they switched to Punisher.

1343
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,580
There's Punisher now.

1344
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,960
They have an Emma now.

1345
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:18,800
Did they always have an Emma?

1346
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:19,980
No, no, no, no.

1347
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:20,400
Okay.

1348
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:21,600

And then we could push this.

1520
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:39,440
All right.

1521
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:40,080
Go, go, go, go, go!

1522
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,020
Do the same thing.

1523
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:42,400
Can I get damage boost, please?

1524
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:42,960
Damage boost, please.

1525
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:43,960
Yeah, yeah.

1526
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:44,900
Damage boost.

1527
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,120
We are undefeatable!

1528
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:49,880
You still saying so far?

1529
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,240
Start backing up.

1530
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:51,720
One's all.

1531
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:52,440
Emma wants all.

1532
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,680
Emma wants all back up.

1533
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:54,220
Start backing up.

1534
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:54,780
Start backing up.

1535
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,320
You see your bubble?

1536
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:56,880
Yeah, yeah.

1537
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,480
She wants all.

1538
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,480
Yeah, I just wanted to put a shield down for Lila.

1539
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:00,980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1540
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:01,320
Okay.

1541
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,360
I have Involne.

1542
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:04,940
I have my alt.

1543
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:05,960
Is he holding all?

1544
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,400
Is he holding all for me to hold my own?

1545
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:08,860
All right.

1546
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:09,460
There it is.

1547
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:10,240
Hey, I'm kiting.

1548
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:10,800
I'm kiting it.

1549
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:11,600
Anybody caught in it?

1550
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:12,280
No, no, no.

1551
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:12,540
We're all fine.

1552
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,300
I'm going to all them on the backside.

1553
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:14,980
Nice, nice.

1554
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:15,900
Help, help, help, help her.

1555
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:18,620
I can't bubble.

1556
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:19,140
Oh, my.

1557
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:19,780
I got two.

1558
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:20,900
I mean, I got Invis.

1559
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,760
I got lasers by herself.

1560
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,080
They killed me.

1561
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:22,380
Slip her.

1562
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:22,900
Slip her.

1563
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:26,340
Oh no.

1564
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:27,420
I'm my own.

1565
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,540
Oh, he's not.

1566
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,240
I'm doing last one.

1567
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:30,640
Last one.

1568
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:31,580
Maybe you can't strange.

1569
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:32,460
If you get strange portal.

1570
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:34,260
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1571
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:34,560
Yeah.

1572
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,640
I almost have all here.

1573
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,700
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1574
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:41,800
We have to move up though.

1575
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,340
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1576
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:45,000
Invis here.

1577
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:46,980
Hit it.

1578
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:47,440
Hit the portal!

1579
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,580
Fucking lost them.

1580
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,580
We're coming, we're coming.

1581
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:51,080
Hold on.

1582
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,580
We're here, we're here, we're here!

1583
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,180
I'm dead, I'm dead.

1584
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,000
I couldn't get to the invisible woman.

1585
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,340
Funny, funny.

1586
01:21:59,020 --> 01:21:59,880
I'm gonna go in this rocket.

1587
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:02,540
I'm dead, I'm dead.

1588
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,160
That's why, I'm dead.

1589
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:06,740
Oh, the portal.

1590
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,140
We're solid as much as we can.

1591
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,580
Oh, the portal.

1592
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:10,660
We get still.

1593
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:11,500
We made it.

1594
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:11,740
That's fine.

1595
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:12,640
I'm going back.

1596
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:13,620
I'm going back.

1597
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,700
Oh, it's all right.

1598
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:15,880
It's all right.

01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:16,760

01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,840
Swap back off and swap off.

01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,760
We staggered her.

1644
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,740

I put it out, bro.

1646
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:49,300
Oh, my God.

Kill me.

01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,220
No survivors.

1650
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,100
Not allowed.

1651
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,000
This is Marvel rivals.

1652
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,640
It's not friendship rivals.

1653
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,760
Marvel, bro.

1654
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,480
I can't help here.

1655
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,340
You made business.

1656
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,160
You're Infants?

1657
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:06,140

1658
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:06,480
We got a kite.

1659
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:07,220
Oh, never mind.

1660
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,080
Nice.

1661
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:08,260
Nice.

1662
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:10,640
Nice.

1663
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:10,680
Nice.

1664
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:10,760
Nice.

1665
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,200
We got it.

1666
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,500
Got it.

1667
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,520
No, no.

1668
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,920
Here we go.

1669
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:22,300
Hey, show,

1670
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,760
go.

1671
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,200
I've got the shotgun out of my ass.

1672
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,380
I got their troops when I I'm looking at this.

1673
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:35,960
I'm looking at this.

1674
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:36,540
I'm looking at this.

1675
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,160
I'm looking at this.

1676
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:37,460
Okay.

1677
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,140
I got me.

1678
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:38,680
I got me this.

1679
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:39,920
Rockets in the back.

1680
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,200
Tomas low.

1681
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,260
Lazy's almost dead.

1682
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:44,060
Lazy is dead.

1683
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:44,520
That's it.

1684
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:45,300
Push them in a spawn.

1685
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:45,620
Back up.

1686
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:46,300
Back up now.

1687
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:46,580
Back up.

1688
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:48,240
Back up.

1689
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:49,460
Back up here.

1690
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:49,920
Back up here.

1691
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:50,380
Back up here.

1692
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:50,680
Save him.

1693
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:51,840
Save him.

1694
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,100
Save him.

1695
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,580
Just absolutely back up.

1696
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,300
If we can shield this.

1697
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:56,920
You don't want to get caught?

1698
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:58,580
No, we're okay.

1699
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,040
We're all okay.

1700
01:24:59,400 --> 01:24:59,640
I have copy.

1701
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:00,100
I have copy.

1702
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:00,720
Yeah.

1703
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:02,820
We can use this to aggress this in three.

I'm very scared and nervous.

1730
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:39,360
No, everyone's hands were shaking during the games.

1731
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,400
I mean, if you were shaking, it didn't show at all.

1732
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:44,220
Oh, really?

1733
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:48,740
Okay, I thought my aim was like all over the place there, but I'm very proud of my team.

1734
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,820
Everybody's saying he needs to be nerfed.

1735
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:50,720
Oh, my goodness.

1736
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:51,820
No, no, no.

1737
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,040
They already took Gambit away from me.

1738
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,180
I want to see you play as Gambit so bad.

1739
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:58,400
I was so sad.

1740
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:56,520
god i'm scared correct this gamut i want to see it so bad please don't ban gamut yeah guys please don't ban gamut so i can play gamut she's not that good on yeah exactly i had the least amount practice on gambit so don't ban gamut obviously go going into that game it was a great go what was your kind of team strategy going into that did you have did you study your opponent yeah no we did we actually um i like looked through every team like what they played the last two days and like you know like usually what they're meaning is not actually what they're playing in a competitive environment so i just looked at their matches and be like oh they've been playing this comp they've been playing that comp so or like they only invested all their time playing on this hero so we knew exactly what to ban because like target banning is a strat so like if we get rid of like what they're practicing on the enemy team yeah so uh i know shoto is a bucky player like a good bucky player so um because he

1741
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:47,980
was on my team for the last vtuber rivals and he was a really good Bucky player the last time we were in a team together so I remember that and I was like okay we gotta get Bucky out um so that was basically our strat I also saw that you were you were just running in first you your attention behind you yeah were you just trying to be a good leader what was going on there it's because like when you mantis all like um you get like insane speed boost so literally we're just like Mach 7 into the support backline because like they can't do anything because if you have like a mantis running straight at you what the fuck know so it was like watching a freight train yeah yeah because like my shout was just to go straight to the support like and then kill one of their supports because that's like literally how you play mantis when you all all right well well your next game is going to be against team uh team do you have any uh any any strategies or is it all close to the chest secret you can't

1742
01:29:47,980 --> 01:30:40,880
tell us oh i can't yeah no no we can't reveal that yeah we actually have like oh yeah yeah i'm glad we could rest because like we are all like so jittery too so we're like we can calm down for this next game and then go into the next one uh but i know we had like notes and stuff too being like okay this this comp will we have to play this comp and this map will play this comp and stuff like that so oh wow so it's yeah i think this is what's fun for me a little planning going on it's just that's what's fun for me i love competitiveness because i watch esports stuff like i watch pro play like i even went to the land in guanjo so i love competitive in general like i love esports and i love strategizing and stuff so that's what makes it fun for me geoning like I mean it was it was very apparent watching the gameplay it seemed like you're having a great time yeah yeah I'm glad my team is very happy with their first they were so nervous going in so now they're all like adrenaline excitement

1743
01:30:40,880 --> 01:31:41,420

1763
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,680
And it didn't help that I...

1764
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,240
Endurance stream battlefield.

1765
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,860
It did not help.

1766
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:12,580
Because I was like, okay, I'm going to join.

1767
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,580
I'll, like, I'll play with them.

1768
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:18,360
Like, after the...

1769
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:19,980
After the...

1770
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:22,640
The Endurance stream.

1771
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:23,700
Because it's not going to be that long.

1772
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,120
But it took so long.

1773
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:26,140
Yeah.

1774
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:28,360
It took so long.

1775
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:30,440
How did...

1776
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,520
We screamed against...

1777
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,340
a manager team.

1778
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:41,760
So we scrimmed against like people actually who manages all the pro team, like majority of pro teams in rivals.

1779
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:52,840
So they know all the strats and they know all the strats and like what pro players play and how to counter and everything because they have to manage the teams and a lot of them are like decent players too.

1780
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:59,920
So we asked them to play specific cops that we know that other teams are playing.

1781
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,100
Do you see round two and round three?

1782
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:01,520
Wait.

1783
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:31,740
um so we asked him to play specific comps that we know what other teams are playing so we could and also doing bands that they might do that us so but then we only had yeah i don't think that was right three hours of that so it was not like we so like that was uh like and then that was like how we strategize the the screen setting um because we're not leaking strats but they can replicate everybody all the captains have fun names to say um huge shout out to to super gomez So,

1784
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:43,140
like, helping out with coaching and giving me, like, ideas on, like, because, like, you know, I don't know everything about pro play, but, like, you know, he does, and he also knows the managers too, so I asked him if he could set up a scrim.

1785
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:51,560
Like, if he could ask the managers, his manager, to set up a scrim for me, and then his manager was like, bro, I could, we'll just do a manager.

1786
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:53,060
Well, bro, you know what?

1787
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,680
All us managers, we want to play this game anyway today.

1788
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:59,740
So, like, bro, and then like, all the managers got together and, like, screamed us.

1789
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:02,980
So that's how we did it.

1790
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:07,780
Yeah, and he also, like, helped coach Heavenly.

1791
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:11,380
He gave, like, he gave coaching tips to Heavenly and Bal, too.

1792
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,160
So, or Bal, too.

1793
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,700
So, like, because, you know, Bal is one of our DPS players.

1794
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:20,640
So, he also coached Heavenly and Bal on, like, what to do.

1795
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,880
I coached the support players, and then he did the tank and...

1796
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,360
Welcome back.

1797
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,680

01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:52,880
Damn.

1823
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:53,260
I know.

1824
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:55,660
It really feels like...

1825
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:56,180
Go ahead.

1826
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,680
I think this was one of the Neymar maps, no?

1827
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:01,160
This is an Angela map.

1828
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:02,440
Also...

1829
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,620
Wait, I got another thing for you guys.

1830
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:05,380

1831
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,100
Okay, okay.

1832
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:07,680
Cool.

1833
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:14,720

1837
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:20,040
Never mind.

1838
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,380
They swapped for a portal.

1839
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:27,250
Wait.

1840
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:27,790
Wait.

1841
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:29,430
Chodo's team.

1842
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:30,050
Wait.

1843
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:32,830
Hey, Chodo's team doing stuff.

1844
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:39,350
They're hella just locked in and started clicking everyone's head.

1845
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:39,670
Kyumi?

1846
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:41,170
Kyumi's executing people.

1847
01:44:41,290 --> 01:44:43,210
I see her all over the kill cam.

1848
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:48,830
Yeah, the thing is, like, we are positioning...

1849
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:49,010
Oh, wait.

1850
01:44:49,170 --> 01:44:51,410
Yeah, they're running double support.

1851
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:54,250
So she couldn't do anything against us because we were triple.

1852
01:44:54,850 --> 01:44:55,630
Like, we were literally...

1853
01:44:55,630 --> 01:44:59,030
She, like, hit us and then we just heal each other up instantly.

1854
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:14,110
ask it was insane someone check her computer bro do you remember that clip of the girl who was cheating and sea ice and she's like tell her what did you put on my computer

01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:30,970
tracking is insane.

1857
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,990
Yeah, it's really interesting watching like really great players.

1858
01:45:36,970 --> 01:45:39,870
Let me reload my thoughts.

1859
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:46,830
Who the fuck is Cream Lord?

1860
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:47,690
Is that Aethel?

1861
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:48,250
That's Aethel.

1862
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:48,910
Yeah.

1863
01:45:53,310 --> 01:45:55,610
Look, she didn't have mercy.

1864
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:56,530
Oh no!

1865
01:45:56,970 --> 01:45:57,430
To my run!

1866
01:45:58,610 --> 01:45:59,670
To my run!

1867
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:03,110
That's so bad.

1868
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:03,970
Oh no.

1869
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:05,250
She was so young.

1870
01:46:06,430 --> 01:46:10,430
Look, SK didn't have mercy, so why should I have mercy?

1871
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,270
You were first, you said the tone.

1872
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:15,630
Yeah, she watched you do that when I read I'm doing that too.

1873
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:16,910
By example.

1874
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:17,870
That's true.

1875
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:18,690
That's true.

1876
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:24,550
It is what it is.

1877
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,510
Oh.

1878
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:27,830

The strange one?

1892
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,660
That's the spread of his bullets for up close.

01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,380
Oh, what the?

1894
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:10,720

You can see Shoto doing the same thing where he just walks in the back.

1902
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:58,940
That was a pretty okay.

1903
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:00,540

01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:16,300
The team chat in the Discord.

1918
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:17,720
Let me see.

1919
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:18,400

01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:30,080
That's cute as hell.

1922
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:32,280
The art is so nice.

1923
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:32,660
What?

1924
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,100
I should be the one joining in the stomping.

1925
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,360
You're like, I am not a victim.

1926
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:40,820
Yeah, I am not a victim, yeah.

1927
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:43,000
I look like I have a pacifier.

1928
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:45,780
I'm part of the problem.

1929
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,640
And she's proud of it.

1930
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:51,300
Yeah!

1931
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:52,420
A problem and proud.

1932
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:55,180
That's right.

1933
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:57,660
I can't believe the cart doesn't block LOS.

1934
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,580
It's just not tall enough.

1935
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:01,980
They're just giving up so much space.

1936
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:02,780
They are.

1937
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:03,400
They're scared.

1938
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:05,260
Without losing anybody.

1939
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:08,400
They should push up a bit more.

1940
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:10,880
Like, this is way too much space that they gave up.

1941
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,520
No, Strange isn't even on the point.

1942
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,420
He's like completely off in Wonderland by himself.

1943
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,720
Yo, Shoto, go down mid, man.

1944
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:19,300
Shoto, Shoto, no, I asked to look for flankers.

1945
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:19,860
He's scared.

1946
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,000
He's, he's, oh, okay.

1947
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:24,220
Yeah, that's why you don't do that.

Oh, my God.

Hawkeye's getting altered, though.

1962
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:54,040
Hawkeye's getting altered, though.

1963
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:54,700
He's altered.

1964
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,500
SK just wasted it.

1965
01:55:57,260 --> 01:55:57,800
No, no.

1966
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:58,220
One kill.

1967
01:55:58,520 --> 01:55:58,940
One kill.

1968
01:55:59,040 --> 01:55:59,960
She's got red, too.

1969
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:01,480
He's, no, he doesn't have it.

1970
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:03,220
Yeah, so he's technically zero kills.

1971
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:07,080
Miss, miss, hit, miss, hit, hit.

1972
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:12,440

2325
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:36,960

02:09:55,590 --> 02:09:55,950
What the wrong?

2335
02:09:56,290 --> 02:09:56,990
Did they use Grudal yet?

2336
02:09:57,130 --> 02:09:57,830
Did they already use Grudal?

2337
02:09:58,090 --> 02:09:58,890
No, he did not.

2338
02:09:58,890 --> 02:09:58,970
Okay.

2339
02:09:59,370 --> 02:10:01,210
I'm going to keep being, I don't have cleanse for it yet.

2340
02:10:02,330 --> 02:10:03,190
He's usually getting cleansed.

2341
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:04,170
I'm, we're fine.

2342
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:04,930
I shielded him.

2343
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:05,470
I walled him off.

2344
02:10:05,550 --> 02:10:05,930
I walled him off.

2345
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:06,790
All right.

2346
02:10:07,290 --> 02:10:07,730
My alt.

2347
02:10:11,730 --> 02:10:12,470
No more alt.

2348
02:10:12,770 --> 02:10:13,490
No more alt.

2349
02:10:13,830 --> 02:10:13,910
Yeah!

2350
02:10:14,070 --> 02:10:14,530

2351
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:15,290
I gotента.

2352
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:15,390
I got Hawkeye.

2353
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:15,930
We can keep pushing.

2354
02:10:16,050 --> 02:10:16,530
We can keep pushing.

2355
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:16,950
Keep pushing.

2356
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:18,230
Keep pushing.

2357
02:10:18,990 --> 02:10:19,170
Keep pushing.

2358
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:19,810
Alright, back up!

2359
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:20,070
Back up!

2360
02:10:20,170 --> 02:10:20,370
Back up!

2361
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:20,670
Back up!

2362
02:10:21,590 --> 02:10:25,170
I have ult soon as well.

2363
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:27,210
We'll use his copy.

2364
02:10:27,970 --> 02:10:28,350
Okay, okay.

2365
02:10:28,650 --> 02:10:29,230
Yeah, use us.

2366
02:10:29,310 --> 02:10:30,590
We all, we engage first.

2367
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:31,450
Okay.

2368
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:34,870
Do you want me to hang around and like, try and get an ult off, on that?

2369
02:10:34,890 --> 02:10:35,850
Oh, the fucking wall came back up.

2370
02:10:35,950 --> 02:10:36,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2371
02:10:36,970 --> 02:10:37,250
Ready?

2372
02:10:37,730 --> 02:10:38,830
Go, go, copy, copy, copy.

2373
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:39,610
Okay.

2374
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:40,010
Okay.

2375
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:40,550
Okay.

2376
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:42,730
Nice.

2377
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:43,130
Outside.

2378
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:44,470
Outside.

2379
02:10:45,450 --> 02:10:46,890

Rocket.

2383
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:53,210

Hawkeye.

2388
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:56,930
Keep going.

2389
02:10:58,630 --> 02:10:59,590
They're all dead.

2390
02:11:00,450 --> 02:11:02,430
They're all dead.

2391
02:11:02,450 --> 02:11:04,990
They have no DPS.

2392
02:11:05,230 --> 02:11:05,510
They have no DPS.

2393
02:11:06,490 --> 02:11:06,890
Careful.

2394
02:11:06,910 --> 02:11:07,050
Careful.

2395
02:11:07,350 --> 02:11:07,850
Get the rocket.

2396
02:11:07,850 --> 02:11:10,290

It's fine.

2408
02:11:46,210 --> 02:11:46,210
It's fine.

2409
02:11:46,230 --> 02:11:46,370
I'm alting.

2410
02:11:47,190 --> 02:11:47,630
We're all in it.

2411
02:11:49,130 --> 02:11:49,270
Nice.

2412
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:49,490

02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:49,610
Nice.

2414
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:50,350
Nice.

2415
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:52,330
Nice.

2416
02:12:01,630 --> 02:12:01,950
Two dead.

2417
02:12:04,610 --> 02:12:04,830
Two dead.

2418
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:04,850
Two dead.

2419
02:12:06,090 --> 02:12:08,290
Two dead.

2420
02:12:08,290 --> 02:12:09,410
Groot, Groot, nice, nice.

02:12:10,450 --> 02:12:10,910
Nice, nice.

2422
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:13,070
You want me out though?

2423
02:12:13,170 --> 02:12:13,710
I got scared.

2424
02:12:13,910 --> 02:12:14,550
My bad, bro.

2425
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:15,690
It was you and him.

2426
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:17,010
Stop bouncing on it, bro.

2427
02:12:17,370 --> 02:12:18,310
They're going to pour out.

2428
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:18,870
They're going to pour out.

2429
02:12:18,990 --> 02:12:19,010
They're going to pour out.

2430
02:12:19,410 --> 02:12:22,250
Push, push, push.

2431
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:23,350
They have one DPS now.

2432
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:23,950
They only have two tanks.

2433
02:12:25,050 --> 02:12:25,370
I have ulti.

2434
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:25,730
I have ulti.

2435
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:26,070
Copy me.

2436
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:27,090
Copy me.

2437
02:12:27,310 --> 02:12:27,630
Copy me.

2438
02:12:27,810 --> 02:12:28,490
I'm running out.

2439
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:29,810
Anyway, I put a wall in the alt.

2440
02:12:31,930 --> 02:12:32,430
Rocket, rocket.

2441
02:12:32,710 --> 02:12:33,090
I got rocket.

2442
02:12:34,450 --> 02:12:34,770
Rockets.

2443
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:35,510
I'm on Yabbit.

2444
02:12:35,650 --> 02:12:36,190
I got, I'm on Yabbit.

2445
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:37,450
Then he's alting.

2446
02:12:37,590 --> 02:12:37,870
Then he's alting.

2447
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:38,790
She's one.

2448
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:39,470
Got him!

2449
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:39,990
Use everything!

2450
02:12:40,170 --> 02:12:40,570
Use everything!

2451
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:41,550
This is last fight!

2452
02:12:43,630 --> 02:12:44,530
Only- only- Nice!

2453
02:12:45,090 --> 02:12:45,490
Nice!

2454
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:46,150
Okay,

2455
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:50,530
good swaps, good swaps.

2456
02:12:50,850 --> 02:12:52,230
Nice swaps, good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2457
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:54,390
Should I go Iron Fist this one because we're pushing?

2458
02:12:54,630 --> 02:12:57,630
I think- Try Iron Fist and if it doesn't work, we do fantastic.

2459
02:12:58,790 --> 02:12:58,990
Okay.

2460
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:04,670
I'll try Emma first and then I can go back to- Yeah.

2461
02:13:05,050 --> 02:13:05,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2462
02:13:06,670 --> 02:13:08,270
We don't have- Oh, we can go back.

2463
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:09,530
Petty on attack here.

2464
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:10,750
Whoa, wait.

2465
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:13,450
Coachman said he can be in VC with us.

2466
02:13:15,210 --> 02:13:17,990
He was told that he can be in VC with us to coach us.

2467
02:13:19,570 --> 02:13:19,590
Nice.

2468
02:13:20,050 --> 02:13:20,370
Wait.

2469
02:13:20,770 --> 02:13:20,950
What?

2470
02:13:21,550 --> 02:13:22,050
Whoa.

2471
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:24,010
Hop in.

2472
02:13:27,330 --> 02:13:31,510
Apparently the production team said they want him to join us.

2473
02:13:33,250 --> 02:13:34,010
Hold up.

2474
02:13:34,630 --> 02:13:37,830
Coach, coach, coach, coach, coach, coach, coach, coach, coach.

2475
02:13:38,290 --> 02:13:40,490
Okay, he's in trim right now, but...

2476
02:13:40,490 --> 02:13:41,010
Coach, coach!

2477
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:42,610
Coach, coach!

2478
02:13:43,030 --> 02:13:43,670
Is he gonna come later?

2479
02:13:43,970 --> 02:13:44,810
Yeah, he's gonna come later.

2480
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:46,330
He said he's the cat right now.

2481
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:47,570
Okay, okay.

2482
02:13:48,030 --> 02:13:48,350
Yay!

2483
02:13:50,570 --> 02:13:51,490
Oh my god.

2484
02:13:53,050 --> 02:13:53,530
Alright.

2485
02:13:54,830 --> 02:13:57,110
I'm getting hard focused by their DP.

2486
02:13:57,350 --> 02:13:58,630
They're literally, like, trying to kill...

2487
02:13:58,630 --> 02:13:59,550
Trying to kill me first.

2488
02:13:59,850 --> 02:13:59,850
Yeah.

2489
02:14:00,130 --> 02:14:00,910
That's crazy.

2490
02:14:01,090 --> 02:14:02,490
Yeah, they were... I saw...

2491
02:14:02,490 --> 02:14:04,170
Both of them were trying solo at me.

2492
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:04,830
Oh.

2493
02:14:12,890 --> 02:14:14,090
Let's go.

2494
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:19,650
That sticker is so cute.

2495
02:14:19,810 --> 02:14:20,090
Yeah.

2496
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:23,670
Oh, oh, ow.

2497
02:14:24,270 --> 02:14:25,130
That's so sad, man.

2498
02:14:25,210 --> 02:14:25,930
We did not look.

2499
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:29,890
It's so sad.

2500
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:31,590
You have Spider-Man?

2501
02:14:32,290 --> 02:14:32,590
It's fine.

2502
02:14:32,870 --> 02:14:33,430
I...

2503
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:34,570
That Wolverine's fine.

2504
02:14:34,570 --> 02:14:34,870
Wolverine.

2505
02:14:34,870 --> 02:14:36,750
I got you guys.

2506
02:14:36,790 --> 02:14:37,590
Bastard blur!

2507
02:14:38,290 --> 02:14:39,890
I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him!

2508
02:14:40,030 --> 02:14:42,290
He got away, he dashed.

2509
02:14:43,690 --> 02:14:44,270
Are you running?

2510
02:14:44,530 --> 02:14:45,590
Do we pop this passive?

2511
02:14:45,970 --> 02:14:47,130
Yeah, I don't know actually.

2512
02:14:48,410 --> 02:14:48,970
I didn't see it.

2513
02:14:49,070 --> 02:14:49,890
It did pop.

2514
02:14:50,110 --> 02:14:52,610
Oh, he got my ass!

2515
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:53,510
Oh, he got my ass!

2516
02:14:54,150 --> 02:14:55,710
Oh, he took you to the...

2517
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:58,290
I am going...

2518
02:14:59,570 --> 02:15:00,370
Mr. Fantastic.

2519
02:15:01,670 --> 02:15:02,270

2536
02:16:01,390 --> 02:16:02,150
They used a brutal ult.

2537
02:16:02,190 --> 02:16:02,670
They wasted it.

2543
02:16:07,870 --> 02:16:07,950
Okay.

2544
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:09,250

Yeah, I know.

2546
02:16:09,910 --> 02:16:12,290
This is the slowest planned death ever.

2547
02:16:15,330 --> 02:16:17,810
I wasn't even Wolverine's initial target.

2548
02:16:18,110 --> 02:16:20,730
You were a coincidental.

2549
02:16:21,610 --> 02:16:23,330
Also, like, does anyone know I played Moon Knight?

2550
02:16:23,490 --> 02:16:24,470
Does anyone know I played Moon Knight?

2551
02:16:25,470 --> 02:16:25,650

Oh, okay.

2557
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:29,350
Triple teams.

Oh, yeah.

02:16:48,330 --> 02:16:48,530
That's fine.

2579
02:16:49,170 --> 02:16:49,530
He's three.

2580
02:16:52,590 --> 02:16:52,630
Three?

2581
02:16:53,130 --> 02:16:53,310
Okay.

02:16:56,390 --> 02:16:56,750

Okay.

2585
02:16:57,990 --> 02:16:58,970
He caught out.

02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:00,210
That's good.

2587
02:17:00,290 --> 02:17:00,630

They're boxing in.

2594
02:17:07,950 --> 02:17:09,070
Oh, my God.

2595
02:17:09,390 --> 02:17:09,490

Swapped and we're gonna use mine and we engage here.

02:17:33,330 --> 02:17:34,270
I'll be able to kill them.

2616
02:17:34,270 --> 02:17:35,370
Are you ready?

2617
02:17:36,150 --> 02:17:36,210

Strange, focus on strange, just strange.

2647
02:18:26,410 --> 02:18:28,110
Hold on, I'm pushing both healers right here.

2648

Nice, nice, nice.

2649
02:18:29,610 --> 02:18:30,530
One healer dead.

I'm blocking, I'm blocking, I'm body blocking.

2651

Nice, nice, nice, nice.

They're running, okay, they're, if they stay on Penny, stay on Moon Knight.

2656
02:18:42,710 --> 02:18:44,390
They're still on Penny, so we win this.

2657
02:18:45,230 --> 02:18:47,170
You need me to switch still, or I feel like I'm kidnapping.

2658
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:47,770
Yeah, you're good, good, good.

2698
02:20:02,030 --> 02:20:02,510
Swap off Moon Knight.

2699
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:02,990
You're on Storm.

2700
02:20:03,810 --> 02:20:04,710
We don't need Moon Knight.

2701
02:20:04,990 --> 02:20:05,670
We need Headscan.

2702
02:20:05,890 --> 02:20:05,970
Oh, wait.

2703
02:20:05,990 --> 02:20:08,450
Actually, yeah, we need Headscan for this.

2704
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:13,570
Come on.

2705
02:20:24,350 --> 02:20:25,370
This guy wants a...

2706
02:20:25,370 --> 02:20:26,610
This Groot wants an alt so bad.

2707
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:27,610
He's so in my face.

2708
02:20:27,810 --> 02:20:28,490
The Wolverine has alt.

2709
02:20:28,590 --> 02:20:29,490
The Wolverine has alt.

2710
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:33,970
So, just make sure you don't get close to the Wolverine.

2711
02:20:34,510 --> 02:20:35,130
That's all you have to do.

2712
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:38,290
Oh, my God.

2713
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:42,310
I didn't see the We need to get blur the fuck off he's one.

2714
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:44,450
I almost have both of you.

2715
02:20:44,530 --> 02:20:45,030
I almost have both of you.

2716
02:20:45,950 --> 02:20:46,610
Oh, I'm dead.

2717
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:47,490
Oh, that's bad.

2718
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:48,070
I didn't get a heal that fuck.

2719
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:51,830
We can get Groot.

2720
02:20:52,130 --> 02:20:52,290
Nice.

2721
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:52,530
Nice.

2722
02:20:52,530 --> 02:20:52,750
Nice.

2723
02:20:52,990 --> 02:20:53,450
Keep up.

2724
02:20:53,470 --> 02:20:53,670
Give him.

2725
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:54,430
I've got you.

2726
02:20:54,470 --> 02:20:54,730
Got you.

2727
02:20:54,910 --> 02:20:55,210
We're even.

2728
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:56,590
We're even, push up a little bit.

2729
02:20:58,710 --> 02:21:02,530
We have storm bolting.

2730
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:03,350
Do we have a support?

2731
02:21:03,550 --> 02:21:07,610
No, it's going to get damage by it.

2732
02:21:08,310 --> 02:21:09,650
There was nothing we could do there.

2733
02:21:10,930 --> 02:21:11,970
No, we're still fine.

2734
02:21:12,050 --> 02:21:12,710
We're only down one.

2735
02:21:12,830 --> 02:21:13,230
We're still fine.

2736
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:13,610
Fight this.

2737
02:21:13,730 --> 02:21:14,130
Fight this.

2738
02:21:14,250 --> 02:21:14,450
Fight this.

2739
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:18,890
Focus on...

2740
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:19,210
I'm dead.

2741
02:21:19,510 --> 02:21:19,650
I'm dead.

2742
02:21:19,770 --> 02:21:19,850

2743
02:21:19,850 --> 02:21:20,210
I'm dead.

2744
02:21:20,390 --> 02:21:20,710
I'm dead.

2745
02:21:20,930 --> 02:21:20,950

02:21:32,410 --> 02:21:32,950
Let's pair ultis.

2754
02:21:33,210 --> 02:21:35,410
Should I go strange instead?

2755
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:36,310
Yeah, go strange.

2756
02:21:36,390 --> 02:21:36,910

Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice!

2766
02:21:52,690 --> 02:21:53,750

2767

2810
02:23:40,190 --> 02:23:40,390

You are?

2843
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:29,240
I would think that they are because we're in the lead.

2844
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:31,360
Then they're next.

2845
02:28:31,420 --> 02:28:37,000

They're just on a break right now.

2853
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:54,800

We can win.

2865
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:20,400
We can do it.

2866
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:21,060
We have the skill.

2867
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:23,160
Aim for the stars.

2868
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:25,220
Oh my gosh.

2869
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:26,300
Bro, I'm getting one guy.

2870
02:29:26,380 --> 02:29:27,940

2871
02:29:28,380 --> 02:29:29,760

02:29:30,780 --> 02:29:32,180
It's Shona versus Scooby next.

2874
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:34,880
Because the graphics are wrong, I think.

2875
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:37,680
I'm looking at match order.

2876
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:39,700
Like, if you go back in the VOD, you can see it.

2877
02:29:39,700 --> 02:30:29,180
um so i don't i think it's so it was dubie versus joki next is dubie versus shoto and then next after that is us versus ama if we're this looks this looks right yeah because it's whatever's on top goes first and then whatever's on bottom goes second yeah okay it's not wrong i just can't okay we got a nice break again dubie versus shoto next oh okay so we get to watch if you i can't read i've illustrated that so many times today we were we were playing a scream earlier and there's a button when you pause it says continue and then continue and i i think wait no one says confirm and one says continue and i just hit continue because continue and confirm look like the same word and i started the game for everyone and and heavenly was eating

2878
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:34,660
yeah oh yeah

2879
02:30:40,420 --> 02:31:23,320

2883
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:42,120
Nice.

2884
02:31:42,700 --> 02:31:44,040
My driver is exploded.

2885
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:45,400
They're coming back.

2886
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:47,200
My driver's exploded.

2887
02:31:47,500 --> 02:31:48,260
They're coming back.

2888
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:49,220
Oh, no.

2889
02:31:49,460 --> 02:31:49,780
Oh, no.

2890
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:50,280
That's okay.

2891
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:56,120
We can ask them to pause the game for like 30, do a 30 minute break and can drive the best by it.

2892
02:31:56,980 --> 02:31:57,780
Yeah, no, no, it's okay.

2893
02:31:58,460 --> 02:32:00,340
I've been having like random driver crashes.

2894
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:02,960
Like I've updated to the newest ones and it just has issues.

2895
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:03,800
I don't know why.

2896
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:04,760
Oh, yeah.

2897
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:06,440
That's why you never update newest drivers.

2898
02:32:07,640 --> 02:33:04,640
oh yeah if i don't update newest drivers it happens more i've been on the same nvidia driver since i plugged this graphics card in my computer because when i updated it once everything fell apart so i was like yep go back no it's actually a windows 11 issue because it's only started happening after i after i had to swap because windows 11 sucks ass it does suck wait none of y'all have like a microsoft sponsorship right well not anymore i'm getting nice going guys what if what if we and we give we give sk siloed for her last game no no thank you if you if you if you squash a first time player then i don't believe in this but don't you guys come on we can give her give her a chance to finally how about we be nice and ban it yeah you don't want me to target ben

2899
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:27,980
the thing is guys saying is yeah that's self-love you know what all right try and out ban me it's a rank ban i i like my odds and gotcha okay but this is our first ban and then we gotcha who who wins the second ban

2900
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:34,560

I'm just figuring it out.

2906
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:18,800
I think it'd be fun, you know?

2907
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:20,920
What if, like, to see who wins the band?

2908
02:34:22,020 --> 02:34:22,140
Yeah.

2909
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:29,840
So...

2910
02:34:29,840 --> 02:35:38,440
we've been against both of those teams already right yeah yeah so yeah oh are they playing a game right yeah so they're playing they're starting now so the thing is whoever wins this game we're going to be playing the next and it'll be best of three oh so amily is like out yes okay once you're o and two you're you're fully out there's no coming yeah okay okay what's your pickums for this one which team do you think is coming out on top honestly it's showedo's team pulled the heck through that was crazy i i i put money on doobie's team blur is just so nasty i'm kind of scared of him yeah blur is like more versatile in what he can play we said sk was nasty too but yeah okay maybe maybe he's nasty i think it's because like sk has been doing like flashy plays like more so like i have to kill people like so she's like flanking a lot but flanking is farming clips like but flanking we're going on a tick tock but the thing is flanking is like you know high reward uh high risk so like

2911
02:35:38,440 --> 02:35:46,320
everyone's been turning around on her and the moment she dies like the whole the front line like the whole front line collapses oh i see

02:35:56,520 --> 02:36:02,060

Can he aim good?

2917
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:45,360
That's what he, that's what Connor said.

2918
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:46,760

The front is cool, though.

02:38:58,320 --> 02:38:59,460
I really like the front too.

02:43:58,670 --> 02:43:59,370
It's all these.

2987
02:44:00,290 --> 02:44:00,610
Okay.

2988
02:44:01,350 --> 02:44:01,570
Yeah.

2989
02:44:01,730 --> 02:44:02,230
They're going to win.

2990
02:44:02,470 --> 02:44:04,010
I mean, yeah, they're going to win this.

2991
02:44:04,490 --> 02:44:05,950
We're up against Duby after.

2992
02:44:06,430 --> 02:44:07,430
Yeah, right up against Amas.

2993
02:44:08,010 --> 02:44:08,570
No, no, after.

2994
02:44:09,190 --> 02:44:09,630
I thought Amalie was out.

2995
02:44:10,450 --> 02:44:12,090
No, but we still, we had to play everyone.

2996
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:13,570
We had to play everyone once.

2997
02:44:14,070 --> 02:44:15,030
We still play Maddie against them.

2998
02:44:15,170 --> 02:44:15,390
I see.

2999
02:44:16,050 --> 02:44:16,350
Yeah.

3000
02:44:16,470 --> 02:44:16,690
Okay.

3001
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:20,590
But like in the finals, we play against Duby's team if they win this.

3002
02:44:21,130 --> 02:44:21,530
Hmm.

3003
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:32,660
I like how excited Connor is.

3004
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:33,680
It's really fun.

3005
02:44:33,940 --> 02:44:35,640
He's a very competitive person, isn't he?

3006
02:44:35,780 --> 02:44:37,600
I know he used to play Apex, too, a lot.

3007
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:39,400
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

3008
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:43,000
He had, like, an Apex arc, a League arc.

3009
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:43,520
Yeah.

3010
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:45,440
He's just a very competitive person, too.

3011
02:44:46,020 --> 02:44:46,680
Mm-hmm.

3012
02:44:47,320 --> 02:44:49,940
Earlier, he was like, I'm really glad we're doing competitive games.

3013
02:44:50,360 --> 02:44:51,820
Yeah, they got the Emma Alt in time.

3014
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:53,640

3191
02:57:37,510 --> 02:57:37,870

02:57:38,170 --> 02:57:38,410
Don't portal.

We're gonna portal last fight.

3194
02:57:40,290 --> 02:57:43,070
We still can't have a copy, too.

3195

02:57:55,370 --> 02:57:55,850
We wait.

3208
02:57:58,110 --> 02:57:58,730

I'm going to disassociate for a bit, too.

3390
03:07:14,110 --> 03:07:16,170
I'm being disassociated.

3391
03:07:17,170 --> 03:07:18,210
Guys, I'm going to.

3392
03:07:18,470 --> 03:07:19,450
I'm looking at DoorDash.

3393
03:07:19,570 --> 03:07:20,930
I'm going to disassociate for a bit.

3394
03:07:21,150 --> 03:07:22,710
I need to calm down.

3395
03:07:23,050 --> 03:07:24,050
Yo, what do I get for dinner?

3396
03:07:25,550 --> 03:07:25,990
Thoughts?

3397
03:07:26,090 --> 03:07:26,910
I'm getting fun.

3398
03:07:27,030 --> 03:07:27,390
Pizza.

3399
03:07:27,710 --> 03:07:28,290
Get pizza.

3400
03:07:28,390 --> 03:08:31,000
oh pizza yeah yeah pizza really good oh my god um i'm really proud of my team we didn't practice we strategized a lot i i used my time because like all of our schedules put mine up um heaven we're just gonna keep we're gonna keep doing our best and and working together and and swapping when when it used to and it'll be okay like heavenly only played with us for two hours for today like yesterday he couldn't like that was the first time we were able to play together as a team like two hours before the stream uh before the tournament because like uh because he couldn't make it to yesterday's scrim so so i'm really proud of us we're able to like do that this well we're not having that much practice together as a team yeah i'm so happy tomorrow you'll be i was so stressed out yeah i fucking wish really stressed out

3401
03:08:36,780 --> 03:09:47,560
I thought I muted the soundboard how is it still coming through that's insane is it like did you just do it on a go XLR uh it's a yeah it's like it's a ported through one yeah I was like I fucking muted all your soundboards on this screen I was not having it I was not having the soundboard shit that is so funny oh my god yeah um but oh my gosh i'm just at a really chinese point in our life um oh she don't want to talk to us no more oh sorry i was just associating us you're good you're good you're good i'm so i'm just you whatever happens that we made it to the they said we're getting it they said we're getting a quick break thank oh oh how quick is that okay i would say the bathroom order food yeah it's a five it is five okay okay yeah i know that my teammates need to be on my screen to get i know that um the thing is like my supports aren't even going to go straight in anyway the reason why i don't do that for my supports is that like i i'm more i'm trying to make sure because i have

3402
03:09:47,560 --> 03:10:43,300
to make the reaction quick so like i can't just like run back and then all i'm i'm focusing on the fact that my dps and tanks are in front of me and they are the most important people to get the ult so like if I have to make a snap decision I'm not gonna have to I'm not gonna look back and then make sure everyone's in my view and then I'll I have to make a snap decision in my ult and be like these are the people that I need to do damage that can do damage yeah who are we going up against Duby yeah our next match is with yeah yeah okay best of three best of three technically we never went to losers so i don't think there's losers in this one no there's no i wanted my extra free one point so it's best two out of our best so we have to play two times instead of three times or one time

3403
03:10:48,060 --> 03:10:57,860
each match they ban they do bands again it's the rank bands it's the same i think they might just do that i do the same bands or they target new bands to make it work Okay.

3404
03:10:58,400 --> 03:11:06,980
So, the thing is, we have to win two games, basically, instead of one.

3405
03:11:08,180 --> 03:11:09,600
Oh, wait, what the...

3406
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:09,860
Okay.

3407
03:11:14,390 --> 03:11:16,870
I'm trying to remember what were the bans that we did.

3408
03:11:17,490 --> 03:11:22,600
I mean, Dubey's team is very strong.

3409
03:11:25,060 --> 03:11:26,340
Like, it's just...

3410
03:11:27,500 --> 03:11:28,760
Blur is just a very strong player.

3411
03:11:33,120 --> 03:11:33,980
I forget.

3412
03:11:34,100 --> 03:11:35,440
Yeah, Blur is really strong.

3413
03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:44,840
You know what they...

3414
03:11:44,840 --> 03:11:47,180
Do you know what they banned out?

3415
03:11:47,320 --> 03:11:50,300

They banned out Mag and Invis.

3419
03:12:02,680 --> 03:12:05,600
I think they did the Invis just so they can run Wolf.

3420
03:12:10,340 --> 03:12:10,660
No.

3446
03:15:35,360 --> 03:15:36,240
Wait, are we doing this?

3447
03:15:36,360 --> 03:15:38,780
I don't know if they're actually doing this type...

3448
03:15:38,780 --> 03:15:39,640
Loser picks.

3449
03:15:41,420 --> 03:15:42,200

03:15:48,740 --> 03:15:49,100
Wow.

3453
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:51,560
Never done that before.

3454
03:15:53,160 --> 03:15:55,020
That's just like...

3455
03:15:55,020 --> 03:15:57,020
Like actually competitive is like that.

3456
03:16:01,450 --> 03:16:02,630
Oh, that's car.

3457
03:16:09,070 --> 03:16:10,910
Okay, the pizza places near me were closed.

3458
03:16:11,030 --> 03:16:11,770
I got Thai food.

3459
03:16:12,090 --> 03:16:12,850
Oh, no.

3460
03:16:13,410 --> 03:16:17,330
Pizza being closed, usually pizza is like the one that's 24-7.

3461
03:16:18,110 --> 03:16:21,190
No, there's one place near me that does it so good and they close it.

3462
03:16:23,650 --> 03:16:25,930
So my chat's like, do I keep rolling and platinum silver?

3463
03:16:26,150 --> 03:16:28,710
The ranks just reset, guys.

3464
03:16:30,290 --> 03:16:32,010
Everyone's ranks just reset.

3465
03:16:32,670 --> 03:16:35,010
They're not actually platinum silver.

3466
03:16:39,730 --> 03:17:09,610
this is so good this is the only time where I tried ranked and I won all 10 placements good for you my placements were ass same it was like 50-50 apparently everyone starts at bronze 3 so I just ended I started bronze 3 and then I ended in gold 2 oh yeah perfect That's a crazy good clan.

3467
03:17:10,750 --> 03:17:13,750
I had Elo Terrorizers in my games.

3468
03:17:13,910 --> 03:17:15,770
Like they were like not real.

3469
03:17:16,330 --> 03:17:17,870
I don't even know what was going on there.

3470
03:17:20,110 --> 03:17:23,530
The guy with the 600 damage and the one kill, that was in one of my placements.

3471
03:17:23,710 --> 03:17:25,030
And he was screaming at me!

3472
03:17:26,570 --> 03:17:27,630
I didn't heal him enough.

3473
03:17:27,730 --> 03:17:28,170
My bad.

3474
03:17:28,870 --> 03:17:30,370
Elo Terrorists are out there everywhere.

3475
03:17:38,720 --> 03:17:43,780
I simply told myself I will only open voice comms when I get to higher Elo.

3476
03:17:44,780 --> 03:18:13,460
it's they're low-key sometimes people are just as mean like yeah yeah I think Rivals has is like almost as toxic as Valorant now oh yeah the amount of times where it's like you open calm and you just like give a give like a call out and then they just like they're like oh woman I don't talk gonna lose I don't I'm not gonna talk to you anymore yeah so I never use voice comes all I do is

3477
03:18:18,330 --> 03:18:22,570
Oh, they're doing an interview right now with Doobie's team, so we're just waiting.

Oh, yeah, yeah, we're preventing the stream snipers Oh So you guys had that game against to be it was very close was yeah did you expect it to be that close were you i did because um i know that some of the players on dubious teams and like what they play i know like ugla is one them i know blur is a very very good fps player because he is apex predator um for many seasons so like i know he's a very he basically his fps skills can transfer to any game so okay um so like i knew his dps was really strong um and they're very coordinated too and he's very flexible so like he could play a lot of characters so like a lot of things yeah so like we can't really target ban him so um at best like we try our best to like strategically what can we survive like the most makes sense and you know there's some ults that we can't survive so we have to ban that true is there any strategy change you're gonna do going into this or you just play on the same game and how can it take you to the victory we'll

3502
03:20:41,430 --> 03:21:07,950
see we'll see how it goes like it really depends on what they're trying to ban because we know our band line um and so it's like what if obviously they want to try and ban something else on us because their first band line didn't work out i mean it did but like in a way where they want to win the next game so obviously they'll try to do a different ban to see which will actually have help them win the game so our strategy just depends on what their band line is because that's how our comps change instantly.

3503
03:21:10,010 --> 03:21:11,410
Yeah, I've seen your text channel.

3504
03:21:11,890 --> 03:21:15,510
You guys have got like the Bible of strategies to look at.

3505
03:21:15,670 --> 03:21:18,510
The little notepad that I used, right?

3506
03:21:18,950 --> 03:21:23,370
There's so many notepads of like, if this happens, it's like a flowchart extravaganza.

3507
03:21:23,810 --> 03:21:24,770
Yeah, like a little flowchart.

3508
03:21:24,870 --> 03:21:27,030
If they ban this, we go to this.

3509
03:21:27,490 --> 03:21:29,730
If they ban that, we go to this.

3510
03:21:30,850 --> 03:21:33,970
But my team, yeah, and my, because that's...

3511
03:21:33,970 --> 03:21:34,790
I'm looking at it right now.

3512
03:21:34,870 --> 03:21:35,890
I'm like, whoa, okay.

3513
03:21:36,570 --> 03:22:51,890
because that's what rivals is like usually it's not rivals is not about like whoever technically it's like it's not really about like for esports it's not about who has the best individual play like best team players it's also about like the bad line too because it changes everything so it's like rock paper scissors so if they if someone messes up the bad line if a team messes up the bad line it's over because the other team has a better comp that can rock paper scissors your comp so it's literally like a mind game all right i guess we'll we'll see how it goes in this final best of three good luck and thanks for putting on the show so far yeah thank you thank you for having us i did not see myself in the final so i'm hey yeah we're here good luck good luck good luck thank you thank you guys bye-bye bye-bye bye no oh my god we're back good interview back oh all right all right time almost time let's do it so this is the back to back to back right yeah

03:28:50,110 --> 03:28:50,650
That's fine.

3568
03:28:51,650 --> 03:28:52,590
His wall's broken.

3569
03:28:53,710 --> 03:28:55,410
Oh, my wall broke because of the moving wall.

3570
03:28:55,530 --> 03:28:55,990

Okay, bye.

3580
03:29:07,550 --> 03:29:08,850
Blur, I'll stab you in the chest.

3581
03:29:11,070 --> 03:29:13,870
I think that's gotta go against code of conduct or something, dude.

3582
03:29:13,990 --> 03:29:14,690
You can't be saying that.

3583
03:29:14,890 --> 03:29:15,570
I mean, in game.

3584
03:29:15,950 --> 03:29:16,570
Low key in game.

3585
03:29:16,830 --> 03:29:17,530
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

3588
03:29:20,110 --> 03:29:21,110
All the healers are cut off.

3589
03:29:22,210 --> 03:29:22,830
Nice, nice, nice.

3590
03:29:23,010 --> 03:29:24,270
Push up, push up, push up, push up, push up.

3591
03:29:24,990 --> 03:29:26,010
You're down, they're down too.

3593
03:29:28,030 --> 03:29:28,230

I have all here.

3597
03:29:33,210 --> 03:29:34,230
We'll use my alt first.

3598
03:29:34,430 --> 03:29:34,830
Let's let you.

3599
03:29:36,210 --> 03:29:39,590
And then if, if the storm alts, you copy me.

3600
03:29:41,650 --> 03:29:42,370
Uh, so.

3601
03:29:42,610 --> 03:29:43,870
He should be close to, if not.

3602
03:29:43,890 --> 03:29:45,090
They're getting, they got a squirrel girl now.

3603
03:29:45,270 --> 03:29:45,330
Ready?

3604
03:29:46,010 --> 03:29:47,350

Go, go, go, go.

3606
03:29:49,350 --> 03:29:49,750
There it is.

3607
03:29:50,310 --> 03:29:51,030
Do I copy?

3608
03:29:51,150 --> 03:29:51,430
Do I copy?

3609
03:29:51,890 --> 03:29:52,370
Yeah, copy me.

3610
03:29:52,470 --> 03:29:52,670
Copy me.

3611
03:29:52,690 --> 03:29:53,090
Copy me.

3612
03:29:53,090 --> 03:29:53,730
Copy me.

3613
03:29:54,250 --> 03:29:55,290
Oh my god.

3614
03:29:55,310 --> 03:29:55,990
I can't see you.

3615
03:29:56,030 --> 03:29:56,570
I can't see you.

3616
03:29:56,750 --> 03:29:58,390
That was so many support ults from them.

3617
03:29:58,610 --> 03:29:59,070
Yeah, it's okay.

3618
03:30:00,130 --> 03:30:00,850
It's fine.

3619
03:30:01,470 --> 03:30:02,150
I'm just gonna die here.

3620
03:30:02,190 --> 03:30:02,690
I'm gonna die here.

3621
03:30:02,750 --> 03:30:03,350
I'm gonna die here.

3622
03:30:03,350 --> 03:30:03,670
I'm gonna die here.

3623
03:30:04,510 --> 03:30:05,070
It's fine.

3624
03:30:05,830 --> 03:30:06,630
They're running Sharknado.

3625
03:30:07,150 --> 03:30:07,250
You can go in with Mantis.

3626
03:30:07,970 --> 03:30:08,770
That was so many ults.

3627
03:30:08,970 --> 03:30:09,030
It's okay.

3628
03:30:09,190 --> 03:30:12,210
For Sharknado, we just shoot the...

3629
03:30:12,210 --> 03:30:12,650
It's good.

3630
03:30:12,710 --> 03:30:15,090
You didn't copy me because I didn't realize they have Jeffnado.

3631
03:30:15,350 --> 03:30:16,050
That was my bad.

3632
03:30:16,050 --> 03:30:16,270
Okay.

3633
03:30:17,370 --> 03:30:17,730
We...

3634
03:30:17,730 --> 03:30:18,930
We still run with Mantis, no?

3635
03:30:19,030 --> 03:30:19,210
All right.

3636
03:30:20,110 --> 03:30:21,810
We run Mantis.

3637
03:30:22,670 --> 03:30:24,630
Mantis Iron Fist Alt first.

3638
03:30:25,030 --> 03:30:25,190
Okay.

Help him.

3650
03:30:37,770 --> 03:30:38,430
Down three.

3651
03:30:40,770 --> 03:30:40,830

3652
03:30:41,370 --> 03:30:41,630

3656
03:30:43,770 --> 03:30:43,870
Clear.

3657
03:30:43,870 --> 03:30:44,370
Klingling!

3658
03:30:45,490 --> 03:30:45,970
Evan!

3659
03:30:46,350 --> 03:30:46,810
Evan!

3660
03:30:47,050 --> 03:30:47,510
I strapped!

3661
03:30:50,590 --> 03:30:52,030
That looked like a failed alt.

3662
03:30:52,170 --> 03:30:52,550
It wasn't.

3663
03:30:53,350 --> 03:30:55,710
The second I ulted, I knew he would waste his two.

3664
03:30:56,070 --> 03:30:56,990
And he got nothing for it.

3665
03:30:58,850 --> 03:31:02,370
That grab was like, that was like so accidental.

3666
03:31:03,290 --> 03:31:06,750
Because tanks are literally monkeys, so monkey see, monkey do.

3667
03:31:07,050 --> 03:31:08,130
He's like, oh yeah, I can do that.

3668
03:31:09,430 --> 03:31:10,190

Yeah, I'm gonna damage boost you.

3678

When he dropped down, I will- Above, above, above.

3680
03:32:03,850 --> 03:32:04,850
Oh, my God, what?

3681
03:32:05,050 --> 03:32:05,290
Okay.

3682
03:32:05,470 --> 03:32:06,230
Oh, I'm gonna put them down, okay.

3683
03:32:06,930 --> 03:32:07,350
I'm here, I'm here.

3684
03:32:07,530 --> 03:32:08,170
We're down, we're down, we're down.

3685
03:32:08,390 --> 03:32:08,730
No, no, no, no, no.

3686
03:32:10,070 --> 03:32:10,510
I'm dead.

3687
03:32:12,830 --> 03:32:13,150
Okay.

3688
03:32:14,030 --> 03:32:14,390
Okay.

3692
03:32:16,850 --> 03:32:17,230
Don't use anything!

3693
03:32:17,770 --> 03:32:17,910
Don't use anything!

3694
03:32:18,050 --> 03:32:18,670
Don't use anything!

3695
03:32:18,750 --> 03:32:19,050
Don't use anything!

3696
03:32:19,230 --> 03:32:19,490
Just die!

3697
03:32:19,550 --> 03:32:19,770
Just die!

3698
03:32:19,830 --> 03:32:20,150
Just die!

3699
03:32:20,550 --> 03:32:23,670
We have three ulties coming up.

3700
03:32:23,770 --> 03:32:26,210

3701
03:32:26,210 --> 03:32:27,770

3703
03:32:29,930 --> 03:32:30,110

3705
03:32:30,850 --> 03:32:31,210
Don't...

3706
03:32:31,210 --> 03:32:31,550
Don't heal.

3707
03:32:31,770 --> 03:32:31,930
Don't heal.

3708
03:32:32,130 --> 03:32:33,030
Let our Loki heal.

3709
03:32:33,130 --> 03:32:33,590
Let our Loki heal.

3710
03:32:34,290 --> 03:32:34,490
Okay.

3711
03:32:34,770 --> 03:32:37,190
I'm gonna do damage boost.

3712
03:32:37,610 --> 03:32:37,770
Okay.

3713
03:32:37,810 --> 03:32:38,990
I have to do that for you though.

3714
03:32:39,570 --> 03:32:40,530
Oh my god.

3715
03:32:40,610 --> 03:32:40,670
Okay.

3716
03:32:40,850 --> 03:32:42,110
Guys, guys, back up, back up, back up.

3717
03:32:42,190 --> 03:32:43,030
We have Loki all here.

3718
03:32:44,350 --> 03:32:45,090
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3719
03:32:45,170 --> 03:32:46,190
I definitely shouldn't have done that.

3720
03:32:46,270 --> 03:32:47,790
I should have done that.

3721
03:32:47,870 --> 03:32:47,870
I bet.

3722
03:32:48,570 --> 03:32:49,690
Okay, but what if we take this guy?

3723
03:32:50,190 --> 03:32:51,210
Strange, what you doing, man?

3724
03:32:51,370 --> 03:32:52,910
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

3725
03:32:52,910 --> 03:32:52,910
I'm here.

3726
03:32:53,370 --> 03:32:53,570
I'm here.

3727
03:32:53,730 --> 03:32:54,130
We can do it.

3728
03:32:54,150 --> 03:32:54,590
We can go.

3729
03:32:55,290 --> 03:32:55,750
Oh, no.

3730
03:32:55,810 --> 03:32:56,050
It's fine.

3731
03:32:56,150 --> 03:32:56,390
It's fine.

3732
03:32:57,250 --> 03:32:57,550
I have rest.

3733
03:32:57,690 --> 03:32:57,830
I have rest.

3734
03:32:57,950 --> 03:32:58,550
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

3735
03:32:58,550 --> 03:32:58,770
They're down.

3736
03:32:58,850 --> 03:32:59,670
We have rest.

3737
03:33:00,030 --> 03:33:00,650
We have rest.

3738
03:33:00,950 --> 03:33:01,770
We have rest.

3739
03:33:01,790 --> 03:33:03,030
Come on.

3740
03:33:03,050 --> 03:33:03,570
Come on, come on, come on.

3741
03:33:03,570 --> 03:33:03,970
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

3742
03:33:04,010 --> 03:33:04,130
I'm dead.

3743
03:33:06,970 --> 03:33:07,390
Nice, nice, nice.

3744
03:33:07,670 --> 03:33:08,070
We're even.

3745
03:33:08,290 --> 03:33:08,490
We're even.

3746
03:33:08,850 --> 03:33:09,310
They are penny.

3747
03:33:09,430 --> 03:33:09,750
They are penny.

3748
03:33:09,750 --> 03:33:10,650
They got plenty.

3749
03:33:10,970 --> 03:33:11,350
I'm switching.

3750
03:33:11,550 --> 03:33:11,730
I'm switching.

3751
03:33:11,790 --> 03:33:12,530
I'm playing Storm.

3752
03:33:12,770 --> 03:33:12,950
Storm.

3753
03:33:13,250 --> 03:33:13,390
Storm.

3754
03:33:16,410 --> 03:33:18,930
I'm going to portal.

3755
03:33:19,730 --> 03:33:20,110
Yeah, portal.

3756
03:33:20,550 --> 03:33:20,650
Portals.

3757
03:33:21,530 --> 03:33:21,630
Portals.

3758
03:33:21,930 --> 03:33:22,050
Portals.

3759
03:33:22,050 --> 03:33:23,270
I'm going to be...

3760
03:33:23,270 --> 03:33:23,650
Keep me up.

3761
03:33:23,750 --> 03:33:23,890
Keep me up.

3762
03:33:24,030 --> 03:33:24,150
Keep me up.

3763
03:33:29,730 --> 03:33:30,010
Okay.

3764
03:33:30,170 --> 03:33:30,670
You're on the point.

3765
03:33:31,370 --> 03:33:32,010
You're on the point.

3766
03:33:32,090 --> 03:33:32,710
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch.

3767
03:33:33,570 --> 03:33:33,790
Nice.

3768
03:33:34,130 --> 03:33:35,450
I'm coming, but I'm one.

3769
03:33:37,190 --> 03:33:37,250
Alt.

3770
03:33:37,870 --> 03:33:38,150
Alt.

3771
03:33:38,170 --> 03:33:38,270
Alt.

3772
03:33:38,370 --> 03:33:38,430
Alt.

3773
03:33:38,430 --> 03:33:38,530
Alt.

3774
03:33:44,670 --> 03:34:13,370

03:34:13,410 --> 03:34:14,250
we're still touching.

3776
03:34:14,370 --> 03:34:14,730
We're still touching.

3777
03:34:15,490 --> 03:34:15,890
Ow, I'm dead.

3778
03:34:15,990 --> 03:34:16,190
I'm dead.

3779
03:34:17,830 --> 03:34:19,130
Okay, we have to swap here.

3780
03:34:19,350 --> 03:34:20,450
We have to swap Loki off.

3781
03:34:21,130 --> 03:34:23,970
He's just farming, abusing the, he's abusing the Moon Knight all here.

3782
03:34:25,070 --> 03:34:25,190
Okay.

3783
03:34:26,890 --> 03:34:28,970
We save Rocket for Jeffnado.

3784
03:34:32,030 --> 03:34:32,950
I think.

3785
03:34:34,350 --> 03:34:39,890
Like, that, the Moon Knight just abused the fact that we have clones.

3786
03:34:40,930 --> 03:34:42,830
And he farmed Moon Knight all way too many times.

3787
03:34:43,530 --> 03:34:43,890
times.

3788
03:34:44,630 --> 03:34:45,530
I'm going back to Emma.

3789
03:34:46,350 --> 03:34:48,070
We might need mag out for the Jeff ult.

3790
03:34:48,470 --> 03:34:49,790
You might have to go mag for that.

3791
03:34:49,910 --> 03:34:51,970
You have to save your mag out just for the Jeff eat.

3792
03:34:52,730 --> 03:34:55,470
Because no one else, no one else can kill the Jeff right now.

3793
03:34:55,650 --> 03:34:57,370
Or should I go cloak for the Jeff ult?

3794
03:34:58,210 --> 03:34:59,090
Do they have a mag?

3795
03:34:59,170 --> 03:34:59,870
Were they running mag?

3796
03:35:00,630 --> 03:35:00,870
No.

3797
03:35:01,070 --> 03:35:01,510
No, okay.

3798
03:35:01,550 --> 03:35:01,790
It's fine.

3799
03:35:02,350 --> 03:35:05,710
If you run through, he would go cloak and then make sure you cloak us.

3800
03:35:06,530 --> 03:35:06,850
If he...

3801
03:35:06,850 --> 03:35:11,030
Young man wolf still, they have an Emma and a strange, I think?

3802
03:35:11,130 --> 03:35:11,270
No.

3803
03:35:14,310 --> 03:35:16,350
All right, you guys still fine with Wolverine?

3804
03:35:16,550 --> 03:35:17,090
We're fine with...

3805
03:35:17,690 --> 03:35:18,210
I think this will work.

3806
03:35:18,450 --> 03:35:19,010
I'm going to...

3807
03:35:19,010 --> 03:35:19,530
This doesn't work.

3808
03:35:19,690 --> 03:35:20,150
I'll switch to Mag.

3809
03:35:20,530 --> 03:35:23,250
Okay, I'm going to keep Save Mantis, but if it doesn't work, I'm swapping to Luna.

3810
03:35:24,090 --> 03:35:24,210
Okay.

3811
03:35:24,630 --> 03:35:25,550
I also don't mind playing Tink.

3812
03:35:26,150 --> 03:35:27,430
Yeah, I can swap with you if you want to.

3813
03:35:27,530 --> 03:35:27,930
Just call...

3814
03:35:27,930 --> 03:35:29,430
You call it, I'll move around you, dude.

3815
03:35:30,250 --> 03:35:30,370
Okay.

3816
03:35:30,790 --> 03:35:34,510
Or I can Hawkeye, because they're all far back and no one's really putting a lot of pressure on me.

3817
03:35:34,510 --> 03:35:35,390
I don't mind playing Mag.

3818
03:35:35,690 --> 03:35:36,150
I can Mag.

3819
03:35:36,930 --> 03:35:37,850
They're running Penny now?

3820
03:35:38,730 --> 03:35:39,310
I hear it.

3821
03:35:39,830 --> 03:35:40,130
Yep.

3822
03:35:42,890 --> 03:35:43,990
Can we get unks, unks?

3823
03:35:44,130 --> 03:35:46,370
I got it, I got it.

3824
03:35:46,630 --> 03:35:47,090
I got it.

3825
03:35:47,750 --> 03:35:47,850
I can't get.

3826
03:35:47,850 --> 03:35:47,910
Oh shit.

3827
03:35:48,170 --> 03:35:48,570
Oh my help.

3828
03:35:48,570 --> 03:35:49,290
Why am I low on my cell phone for a second?

3829
03:35:49,310 --> 03:35:49,990
We can push up a little.

3830
03:35:50,230 --> 03:35:51,450
We have um, fine.

3831
03:35:51,630 --> 03:35:51,950
Okay, okay.

3832
03:35:52,370 --> 03:35:53,530
No more, no more, no more.

3833
03:35:53,610 --> 03:35:54,110
I can't really go in.

3834
03:35:54,570 --> 03:35:56,810
Yeah, they're, they're getting all they're getting it for free.

3835
03:35:57,250 --> 03:35:58,310
We let them have it for free.

3836
03:35:59,270 --> 03:36:00,130
Oh, we just used it up.

3837
03:36:00,190 --> 03:36:01,430
Cloak up, cloak up, cloak up, cloak up this cloak.

3838
03:36:03,530 --> 03:36:03,950
Damn, what?

3839
03:36:04,030 --> 03:36:04,630
You got this shit already?

3840
03:36:05,250 --> 03:36:05,910
Yeah, that's why.

3841
03:36:07,230 --> 03:36:07,730
All right, look.

03:36:13,450 --> 03:36:13,570
I'm dead.

3845
03:36:13,750 --> 03:36:13,850
Nice.

3846
03:36:13,990 --> 03:36:14,270
Nice, nice, nice.

3847
03:36:14,350 --> 03:36:14,790
We got it.

3848
03:36:16,650 --> 03:36:17,250
Spread out.

3849
03:36:17,250 --> 03:36:18,450
Spread out, spread out.

3850
03:36:18,450 --> 03:36:19,170
Spread out.

3851
03:36:19,710 --> 03:36:20,950
And then kill him after.

3852
03:36:21,630 --> 03:36:22,450
Nice, nice, nice.

3853
03:36:22,830 --> 03:36:23,950
Oh no, that's okay.

3854
03:36:24,550 --> 03:36:25,510
We didn't need that.

3855
03:36:25,510 --> 03:36:25,850
Oh, wait.

3856
03:36:25,910 --> 03:36:26,610

3857
03:36:27,270 --> 03:36:27,630
Neverm.

3858
03:36:27,630 --> 03:36:31,610
I missed the fuck.

3859
03:36:31,830 --> 03:36:32,370
It's fine, it's fine.

3860
03:36:33,690 --> 03:36:34,350
Can't get him.

3861
03:36:35,570 --> 03:36:35,810
All right.

3862
03:36:35,870 --> 03:36:37,990
We're going to use my ult to engage here.

3863
03:36:38,250 --> 03:36:38,690
I can ult you?

3864
03:36:38,790 --> 03:36:38,930
Okay.

3865
03:36:39,730 --> 03:36:41,950
I have ults also but we could probably save mine.

3866
03:36:45,430 --> 03:36:46,430
All right, ready?

3867
03:36:46,890 --> 03:36:48,510
Three, two, one.

3868
03:36:48,850 --> 03:36:50,250
Go, go, go, go, go.

3869
03:36:51,310 --> 03:36:51,850
You're kiting.

3870
03:36:51,990 --> 03:36:54,370
They're going to try and kite it.

3871
03:36:54,370 --> 03:36:54,810
Good one.

3872
03:36:55,590 --> 03:36:56,470

She's alone.

3881
03:37:03,730 --> 03:37:04,170
Kill this.

3882
03:37:04,450 --> 03:37:05,050
Panty, Panty, Panty.

3883
03:37:05,210 --> 03:37:05,390
Panty.

3884
03:37:05,710 --> 03:37:06,150
Oh, wait.

3885
03:37:06,270 --> 03:37:10,710
I'm holding them to the wall.

3886
03:37:10,830 --> 03:37:11,410
What the hell's going on?

3887
03:37:11,410 --> 03:37:12,030
It's just the map's moving.

3888
03:37:12,470 --> 03:37:13,310
God damn it.

3889
03:37:18,710 --> 03:37:19,570
We don't have support else here.

3890
03:37:19,670 --> 03:37:19,990
We have to.

3891
03:37:21,050 --> 03:37:21,450
I'm low.

3892
03:37:22,130 --> 03:37:22,790
I guess I got Penny.

3893
03:37:22,950 --> 03:37:23,090
I got Penny.

3894
03:37:23,310 --> 03:37:23,410
I got Penny.

3895
03:37:23,570 --> 03:37:24,210
Penny dead.

3896
03:37:25,590 --> 03:37:25,650
He ate me.

3897
03:37:25,650 --> 03:37:26,070
He ate me.

3898
03:37:26,890 --> 03:37:27,070
I died.

3899
03:37:27,570 --> 03:37:28,230
Oh my god.

3900
03:37:28,350 --> 03:37:28,590
I can't.

3901
03:37:28,750 --> 03:37:29,210
I can't kill him.

3902
03:37:29,270 --> 03:37:29,810
I can't kill him.

3903
03:37:30,090 --> 03:37:30,410
Yeah, yeah.

3904
03:37:32,170 --> 03:37:32,950
We're gonna need mag.

3905
03:37:33,010 --> 03:37:33,510
Swap to mag.

3906
03:37:34,610 --> 03:37:35,470
Swap to mag here.

3907
03:37:38,730 --> 03:37:39,930
I saw you believe.

3908
03:37:40,350 --> 03:37:41,990
Oh, go, go, go, go.

3909
03:37:44,910 --> 03:37:48,770
We need mag up for the Jeff.

3910
03:37:48,970 --> 03:37:49,250
For Jeff.

3911
03:37:49,870 --> 03:37:49,930
Yep.

3912
03:37:50,490 --> 03:37:54,090
And the cloak too.

3913
03:37:55,210 --> 03:37:55,770
I have my ult.

3914
03:37:55,870 --> 03:37:56,530
We can push with it.

3915
03:37:58,690 --> 03:37:59,810
Do they have shields?

3916
03:38:00,570 --> 03:38:00,770
No.

3917
03:38:01,170 --> 03:38:02,570
They're gonna have Munayel though.

3918
03:38:03,350 --> 03:38:03,570
Okay.

3919
03:38:05,750 --> 03:38:05,990

We have to shoot it.

3923
03:38:07,510 --> 03:38:08,270
We just have to shoot it.

3924
03:38:08,590 --> 03:38:09,030

What?

3969
03:40:11,740 --> 03:40:12,300

3970
03:40:12,420 --> 03:40:12,820
Oh, my God.

3971
03:40:12,960 --> 03:40:13,240

Unlucky.

3975
03:40:16,360 --> 03:40:16,500
It's okay.

3976
03:40:16,500 --> 03:40:16,820
It's okay.

3977
03:40:17,320 --> 03:40:17,940
It's only one.

3978
03:40:18,060 --> 03:40:18,580
It's only one.

3979
03:40:18,720 --> 03:40:19,640
We just forgot two more.

3980
03:40:20,260 --> 03:40:21,780
My thing bugged out.

3981
03:40:23,600 --> 03:40:24,400
Good try.

3982
03:40:24,920 --> 03:40:27,080
I was trying to portal and then my keys bugged out there.

03:40:29,300 --> 03:40:29,660
Hmm.

3985
03:40:31,460 --> 03:40:33,360
You want to still keep me on DPS then?

3986
03:40:33,620 --> 03:40:35,180
I feel like we were able to.

3987
03:40:35,580 --> 03:40:38,040
I need something to contest about Moon Knight.

3988
03:40:38,140 --> 03:40:40,660
Moon Knight's just getting fucking hell of re-damage.

3989
03:40:40,800 --> 03:40:41,920
I'm able to contest Moon Knight.

3990
03:40:42,200 --> 03:40:44,800
I think Jeff is way too disruptive right now.

3991
03:40:45,460 --> 03:40:45,640
Okay.

03:40:45,840 --> 03:40:46,000

It didn't let me pick.

Well, good news.

4002
03:42:28,020 --> 03:42:28,940
This is not a Jeff map.

4003
03:42:29,940 --> 03:42:31,140
So we don't have to worry about banning Jeff.

4004
03:42:31,600 --> 03:42:31,700
Okay.

4005
03:42:32,080 --> 03:42:34,840

4014
03:42:46,500 --> 03:42:48,800
If they first ban Gambit, we ban Storm.

4015
03:42:49,860 --> 03:42:49,980
Okay.

4016
03:42:50,160 --> 03:42:50,400
Okay.

4017
03:42:54,680 --> 03:42:55,080
Okay.

4018
03:42:55,800 --> 03:42:55,860
Hello.

4019
03:42:56,500 --> 03:42:56,920
Hey.

4020
03:42:56,980 --> 03:42:57,140
Okay.

4021
03:42:57,320 --> 03:42:57,880
We ban Storm.

4022
03:42:58,120 --> 03:42:58,280
All right.

4023
03:42:58,880 --> 03:43:00,200
Be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be,

4024
03:43:06,720 --> 03:43:10,140
be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, this is?

4025
03:43:10,140 --> 03:43:10,860
Yeah, this is.

4026
03:43:10,880 --> 03:43:11,750
Oh, wait, this is the Helen map!

4027
03:43:11,750 --> 03:43:12,090
Benhella!

4028
03:43:12,250 --> 03:43:12,430
Benhella!

4029
03:43:12,830 --> 03:43:12,930
Benhella!

4030
03:43:13,010 --> 03:43:13,490
Benhella!

4031
03:43:13,650 --> 03:43:14,010
Benhella!

4032
03:43:14,250 --> 03:43:15,790
Now, no, no, no!

4033
03:43:15,990 --> 03:43:16,610
Hela, all of you guys, hela!

4034
03:43:16,930 --> 03:43:17,110
Hela!

4035
03:43:17,530 --> 03:43:17,790
Hela, Hela!

4036
03:43:18,690 --> 03:43:19,210
Bannhella!

4037
03:43:19,650 --> 03:43:19,650
Bannhella!

4038
03:43:21,590 --> 03:43:24,170
And then we'll be like, the bann...

4039
03:43:24,170 --> 03:43:25,570
the gotcha messed up.

4040
03:43:26,010 --> 03:43:27,330
We actually wanted to ban...

4041
03:43:27,330 --> 03:43:28,690
We can make it work.

4042
03:43:28,970 --> 03:43:29,670
We can just play Hanna.

4043
03:43:29,810 --> 03:43:32,010
Hanna, can you... Can we honor that?

4044
03:43:34,230 --> 03:43:35,810
We had a joke.

4045
03:43:36,350 --> 03:43:36,450
Yeah.

4046
03:43:38,890 --> 03:43:40,210
Majority of us pick.

4047
03:43:42,910 --> 03:43:47,210
fuck no they're gonna say no we're gonna need to restart this if we want to do that yeah

4048
03:43:50,290 --> 03:44:47,520
i didn't really realize i mean we can handle hella if they don't hella instead of storm is our bad line but they can't get storm we have to we have to restart oh we don't yeah can we restart lobby and restart and you'll honor honor the map 30 seconds before you attack get ready i'll do it yeah we'll honor same bands the same bands same bands and same maps all right except for hella over storm yeah there you go that's unfortunate for sure i forgot that we were on that map it's okay it's okay they want to know if you're ready

4049
03:44:50,560 --> 03:45:11,540
yeah all right we have to we have to down hard because that was the whole map too this sucks my lap my thing lagged i couldn't like pick it it was it only me was i the only one allowed to pick the map yeah yeah Oh, they're here.

4050
03:45:15,530 --> 03:45:16,990
We're in China.

4051
03:45:23,750 --> 03:45:24,510
.

4052
03:45:26,770 --> 03:45:27,250
.

4053
03:45:27,250 --> 03:45:27,710
.

4054
03:45:27,710 --> 03:45:28,110
.

4055
03:45:28,110 --> 03:45:28,590
.

4056
03:45:33,330 --> 03:45:37,510
Wow, you're more Chinese than I am.

4057
03:45:38,010 --> 03:45:39,750
You've caught me in a very Chinese part of my life.

4058
03:45:40,370 --> 03:45:40,390
.

4059
03:45:41,570 --> 03:45:43,050
I like to pick Jeff.

4060
03:45:43,970 --> 03:45:44,310
What are we doing?

4061
03:45:44,490 --> 03:45:44,950
It doesn't matter.

4062
03:45:45,070 --> 03:45:45,730
It's okay.

4063
03:45:46,130 --> 03:45:47,330
So, Ben.

4064
03:45:48,250 --> 03:45:49,890
Ben, Bucky, Hella.

4065
03:45:50,470 --> 03:45:50,990
We just got to honor that.

4066
03:45:59,470 --> 03:46:01,650
What's the support that you want me on?

4067
03:46:02,410 --> 03:46:04,270
If they run, we run Loki first.

4068
03:46:04,370 --> 03:46:07,210
If they run Moon Knight, you swap off of Loki instantly.

4069
03:46:09,070 --> 03:46:16,450
For Res, you have to wait until two people die and don't Res in the middle of the point.

4070
03:46:16,590 --> 03:46:17,190
That's really it.

4071
03:46:19,270 --> 03:46:22,650
But like, the most ideal playing against Storm, we have to play Luna.

4072
03:46:23,470 --> 03:46:24,290
That's the most ideal.

4073
03:46:24,550 --> 03:46:31,870
But with that, your hero pool is so fucking limited because if we play Luna, you have to play it either.

4074
03:46:32,530 --> 03:46:36,230
We could try and make Adam work, but I also have to swap to something else.

4075
03:46:38,090 --> 03:46:40,550
Because we need to play Luna against, like, Storm.

4076
03:46:41,970 --> 03:46:42,150
Okay.

4077
03:46:44,010 --> 03:46:46,090
I can't, we can go...

4078
03:46:46,590 --> 03:46:54,510
okay we can try and go rocket luna loki for now rocket luna loki yeah

4079
03:47:01,120 --> 03:47:21,940
hmm i like this i like this all right we got this so luna will focus on the will focus on alting for storm and we have to i think if they have a storm we need a hit scan we need a hit scan you need do you know i put Punisher, Heavenly?

4080
03:47:22,900 --> 03:47:23,060
Yeah.

4081
03:47:23,800 --> 03:47:23,940
Okay.

4082
03:47:25,420 --> 03:47:28,180
We might have to run Emma.

4083
03:47:29,680 --> 03:47:30,440
Emma Punisher.

4084
03:47:31,480 --> 03:47:32,280
I'm Emma Punisher.

4085
03:47:33,020 --> 03:47:34,160
Or, yeah, sir.

4086
03:47:35,340 --> 03:47:36,320
You want me to swap off now?

4087
03:47:36,320 --> 03:47:38,220
Yeah, I need you to be on Punisher.

4088
03:47:38,820 --> 03:47:39,420
If you're on Storm.

4089
03:47:45,430 --> 03:47:46,730
Or do you know I play Phoenix?

4090
03:47:46,890 --> 03:47:48,330
Phoenix is the best character against Storm.

4091
03:47:50,190 --> 03:47:51,350
I haven't played her yet.

4092
03:47:51,370 --> 03:47:51,790
It's fine.

4093
03:47:51,870 --> 03:47:52,910
We can try and make this.

4094
03:47:53,090 --> 03:47:53,430
Yeah, yeah.

4095
03:47:54,690 --> 03:48:27,250
need to do is capture the missionary kind of unfortunate because don't go too far don't go too far don't go too far don't go too far yeah there's no reason to play i'm gonna use this real quick yeah yeah up top up top up top we need someone to oh the server is lagging okay it's fine it keeps lagging on this map specifically i noticed too much fog they have a storm We have a storm but our Punisher is gonna be dealing with that.

4096
03:48:27,430 --> 03:48:29,210
That fucked up so bad.

4097
03:48:29,370 --> 03:48:30,090
My hook did not.

4098
03:48:30,110 --> 03:48:30,930
Hopefully we're supposed to hook.

4099
03:48:31,030 --> 03:48:31,610
Oh good, oh good, okay.

4100
03:48:31,830 --> 03:48:32,670
We have Rez, we have Rez.

4101
03:48:33,190 --> 03:48:34,890
Yeah, we're up.

4102
03:48:35,550 --> 03:48:36,770
Can we get Moon Knight up there still?

4103
03:48:37,270 --> 03:48:38,030
I can't get him.

4104
03:48:38,130 --> 03:48:38,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4105
03:48:38,590 --> 03:48:39,730
They both focus me at the same time.

4106
03:48:42,050 --> 03:48:43,010
Oh, behind, behind.

4107
03:48:43,150 --> 03:48:43,330
Yeah.

4108
03:48:44,010 --> 03:48:44,290
Storm.

4109
03:48:44,450 --> 03:48:45,150
Storm's up close.

4110
03:48:45,470 --> 03:48:46,290
Don't even be able to kill her.

4111
03:48:48,170 --> 03:48:49,110
No, I can't get her!

4112
03:48:49,170 --> 03:48:49,990
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice!

4113
03:48:49,990 --> 03:48:50,990
She's dead, she's dead!

4114
03:48:51,130 --> 03:48:51,730
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

4115
03:48:51,830 --> 03:48:52,630
Go, keep going, keep going, keep going with that.

4116
03:48:52,710 --> 03:48:53,110
Keep going now.

4117
03:48:53,170 --> 03:48:54,210
I'm okay, I'm okay here.

4118
03:48:55,190 --> 03:48:55,770
I'm dying.

4119
03:48:55,890 --> 03:48:56,850
I'm going to но.

4120
03:48:56,850 --> 03:48:57,010
I'm going to all here.

4121
03:48:57,550 --> 03:48:57,790
Keep going.

4122
03:48:57,930 --> 03:48:58,130
Keep going.

4123
03:48:58,250 --> 03:48:58,470
It's fine.

4124
03:48:59,110 --> 03:49:02,370
This is real firepower.

4125
03:49:03,030 --> 03:49:03,450
We're down.

4126
03:49:03,710 --> 03:49:03,990

You have to.

4153
03:50:10,950 --> 03:50:11,310
You have to kill him.

4154
03:50:11,370 --> 03:50:11,990
You want the money.

Just die.

4165
03:50:25,090 --> 03:50:25,330
Just die.

03:50:25,430 --> 03:50:25,710
Just die.

4167
03:50:25,850 --> 03:50:25,930
Just die.

4168
03:50:25,930 --> 03:50:26,570
Just never use nothing.

4169
03:50:26,730 --> 03:50:26,890
Use nothing.

4170
03:50:28,050 --> 03:50:28,390
Use nothing.

4171
03:50:28,390 --> 03:50:28,530
Use nothing.

4172
03:50:29,010 --> 03:50:29,010
Use nothing.

4173
03:50:29,270 --> 03:50:30,790
Oh, don't use anything.

4174
03:50:30,850 --> 03:50:31,250
Don't use anything.

4175
03:50:31,990 --> 03:50:33,670
Don't use anything.

4176
03:50:34,530 --> 03:50:35,750
Don't rest.

4177
03:50:36,410 --> 03:50:37,430
Don't rest.

4178
03:50:37,430 --> 03:50:37,710
Don't rest.

4179
03:50:37,850 --> 03:50:38,210
Don't rest.

4180
03:50:38,210 --> 03:50:38,490
Don't rest.

4181
03:50:38,490 --> 03:50:38,710
Don't rest.

4182
03:50:38,890 --> 03:50:39,130
Don't rest.

4183
03:50:40,490 --> 03:50:41,530
We got to regroup.

4184
03:50:41,690 --> 03:50:42,150
We got to regroup.

4185
03:50:42,930 --> 03:50:43,210
Oh, no.

4186
03:50:43,310 --> 03:50:43,530
Oh, no.

4187
03:50:43,870 --> 03:50:43,870

03:50:47,650 --> 03:50:47,830
Okay.

4193
03:50:48,030 --> 03:50:48,290

4222
03:51:19,390 --> 03:51:20,170

This is laggy.

4228
03:51:26,670 --> 03:51:27,470

4252
03:51:52,090 --> 03:51:53,610

Blurred is no fucking way, dog.

4549
04:02:01,330 --> 04:02:02,530
We're not doing this, big dog.

4550
04:02:04,570 --> 04:02:04,930
Change.

4551
04:02:06,150 --> 04:02:06,510

04:02:08,210 --> 04:02:08,410

Right side, right side.

4561
04:02:14,650 --> 04:02:16,430
All right, Yuzu, you hide for this fight.

4562
04:02:16,850 --> 04:02:17,970
You hide for this fight.

4563
04:02:18,210 --> 04:02:19,050
Luna, don't ult.

4564
04:02:19,210 --> 04:02:20,010
We all get wiped.

4565
04:02:20,170 --> 04:02:20,930
We don't use ults.

4566
04:02:21,090 --> 04:02:21,670
We don't use ults.

4567
04:02:21,770 --> 04:02:22,350
Yuzu, hide.

4568
04:02:22,490 --> 04:02:23,130
We all get wiped.

4569
04:02:23,290 --> 04:02:24,550
Let them use every ult they can.

4570
04:02:24,990 --> 04:02:25,710
And then we...

4571
04:02:25,710 --> 04:02:26,190
Got it, got it, got it.

4572
04:02:27,030 --> 04:02:28,090
We're here to bait ults here.

4573
04:02:28,150 --> 04:02:28,850
Oh, it's okay.

4574
04:02:28,910 --> 04:02:29,230
We have res.

4575
04:02:30,710 --> 04:02:31,750
You don't have to reuse for res.

4576
04:02:33,190 --> 04:02:34,450
Uh, what's going on top again?

4577
04:02:34,470 --> 04:02:35,230
He's going in our back lane.

4578
04:02:35,510 --> 04:02:35,930
Yeah, okay.

4579
04:02:38,510 --> 04:02:39,570
Just die, just die here.

4580
04:02:39,630 --> 04:02:40,130
Die here.

4581
04:02:40,210 --> 04:02:40,390
Die here.

4582
04:02:40,390 --> 04:02:40,410
Die here.

4583
04:02:40,470 --> 04:02:40,650

4584
04:02:40,650 --> 04:02:40,950
Die here.

4585
04:02:41,350 --> 04:02:41,990
Let us die here.

4586
04:02:43,130 --> 04:02:43,750
Fight it death.

4587
04:02:43,790 --> 04:02:44,070
Nice, nice.

4588
04:02:44,210 --> 04:02:44,490

4589
04:02:44,730 --> 04:02:45,010
Brace list.

4590
04:02:48,670 --> 04:02:49,310

Oh, nice.

4596
04:02:54,270 --> 04:02:56,290
That was just a good counter-all.

4597
04:02:56,390 --> 04:02:56,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4598
04:02:57,730 --> 04:02:58,730
We had to...

4599
04:02:58,730 --> 04:02:59,390
It's fine, it's fine.

4600
04:02:59,710 --> 04:03:00,010
It's fine.

4601
04:03:00,090 --> 04:03:00,730
They used a lot of us.

4602
04:03:00,810 --> 04:03:01,390
We still have Luna.

4603
04:03:01,610 --> 04:03:02,270
We have Luna and Emma.

4604
04:03:02,310 --> 04:03:02,750
They used Groot Vult.

4605
04:03:03,010 --> 04:03:03,550
They used Groot Vult.

4606
04:03:05,010 --> 04:03:05,890
We still have a lot.

4607
04:03:05,990 --> 04:03:07,530
We can contest.

4608
04:03:08,310 --> 04:03:08,490
Um, they...

4609
04:03:08,490 --> 04:03:09,090
Yeah, no, I have to play.

4610
04:03:09,190 --> 04:03:10,350
They only have Screen Job.

4611
04:03:10,390 --> 04:03:11,470
You keep Luna all for Strange.

4612
04:03:11,710 --> 04:03:12,610
Keep Luna all for Strange.

4613
04:03:13,530 --> 04:03:17,330
That's all you need to do.

4614
04:03:18,050 --> 04:03:19,150
We get Emma all this as well.

4615
04:03:19,450 --> 04:03:19,950

4616
04:03:20,170 --> 04:03:20,590

04:03:23,170 --> 04:03:23,670
That's okay.

4619
04:03:27,370 --> 04:03:30,210
Yeah, if it was like a done deal, yeah, we didn't have to mag that.

4620
04:03:30,510 --> 04:03:30,910

Go to DPS.

4673
04:04:39,990 --> 04:04:40,490

04:04:47,590 --> 04:04:49,430
Sorry about that, Red, guys.

4677
04:04:49,430 --> 04:04:50,590
No, no, it's okay.

4678
04:04:50,910 --> 04:04:52,850
That's why it's like you have when we say like...

4679
04:04:52,850 --> 04:04:53,530
They literally just countered your rows.

4680
04:04:53,810 --> 04:04:54,370
It's not your fault.

4681
04:04:54,830 --> 04:04:56,530
He just had to like...

4682
04:04:56,530 --> 04:04:57,970
Uh, we just keep this comp.

4683
04:04:58,150 --> 04:04:58,850
Good job, head ass.

4684
04:04:59,690 --> 04:04:59,930
Okay.

4685
04:05:01,170 --> 04:05:03,430
Unless they start target batting, we could play other comps.

4686
04:05:04,470 --> 04:05:04,710
Yep.

4687
04:05:07,650 --> 04:05:09,450

4689
04:05:13,330 --> 04:05:19,270
Okay, so you see, when I say like, hi for res, you just go like, not even close to us, basically.

4690
04:05:19,430 --> 04:05:42,990
already yeah it's like you go like uh uh you just like hide essentially like you make sure that they can't find you away from the fight yeah yeah you just have to be away from the fight but not too far away but for if you res before the portal you rest outside the portal and then you go in okay okay that's how you do the res this is it it's convergence

4691
04:05:47,150 --> 04:05:57,570
she picks her team picks It'd be kind of cool if they did use guard again or you just so My least favorite of these is Tokyo.

4692
04:05:57,710 --> 04:05:58,190

There is an Ironman.

4726
04:09:06,950 --> 04:09:07,130
Ironman.

4727
04:09:07,170 --> 04:09:07,430
Ironman.

4728
04:09:08,070 --> 04:09:09,350

04:09:09,990 --> 04:09:11,450
Oh, he's so low.

4730
04:09:12,950 --> 04:09:13,910
He's so unlucky.

4731
04:09:14,210 --> 04:09:15,410
That guy was one HP.

4732
04:09:16,750 --> 04:09:18,710
I just needed to hit a third shot.

4733
04:09:19,190 --> 04:09:19,410

Help or Emma.

4737
04:09:21,250 --> 04:09:21,930
I can't do any.

4738
04:09:22,010 --> 04:09:22,610
Okay, nice.

4739
04:09:24,470 --> 04:09:27,850
I just got kicked into the enemy team, but now they're walled in.

4740
04:09:28,030 --> 04:09:29,270
I don't have Involm.

4741
04:09:29,330 --> 04:09:29,810
No, I'm good.

4742
04:09:32,150 --> 04:09:32,670
It's fine.

4743
04:09:32,670 --> 04:09:34,510
Oh, we might.

4744
04:09:34,690 --> 04:09:35,090
I got Flour.

4745
04:09:35,270 --> 04:09:35,650
I got Flour.

4746
04:09:36,410 --> 04:09:37,170
I got Flour.

4747
04:09:37,670 --> 04:09:39,670
I think I'm going to play Mag into this.

4748
04:09:39,950 --> 04:09:41,670
We can still triple tank, but I'm going to play Mag.

4749
04:09:41,990 --> 04:09:43,650
No, we don't triple tank on offense.

4750
04:09:43,670 --> 04:09:44,110
No, no, it's fine.

4751
04:09:44,210 --> 04:09:45,050
We can still triple tank this.

4752
04:09:45,110 --> 04:09:46,110
We can still triple tank this.

4753
04:09:46,850 --> 04:09:47,290
It's fine.

4754
04:09:47,530 --> 04:09:48,670
No, just keep it, keep it, keep it.

4755
04:09:50,290 --> 04:09:50,890
I have ult soon.

4756
04:09:51,450 --> 04:09:51,870
I have ult soon.

4757
04:09:52,030 --> 04:09:54,270
They have two characters that can be kind of a Mag.

4758
04:09:54,390 --> 04:09:54,710
Altus?

4759
04:09:55,170 --> 04:09:55,630
It's fine.

4760
04:09:56,330 --> 04:09:57,750
I'll put as many walls between us and her.

4761
04:10:00,250 --> 04:10:03,010
Spread out.

4762
04:10:03,370 --> 04:10:04,090
You got nothing?

4763
04:10:04,170 --> 04:10:04,510
You got nothing?

4764
04:10:04,670 --> 04:10:05,530
Kill Jeff?

4765
04:10:05,670 --> 04:10:05,910
We can.

4766
04:10:06,330 --> 04:10:06,990
Oh, she lives.

4767
04:10:07,610 --> 04:10:08,350
We got Ironman.

4768
04:10:08,390 --> 04:10:08,810
Ironman one.

4769
04:10:09,110 --> 04:10:09,610
He's gone.

4770
04:10:09,710 --> 04:10:09,990
He's gone.

4771
04:10:10,070 --> 04:10:11,110
I have copies, dude.

4772
04:10:11,470 --> 04:10:12,030
I have copies.

4773
04:10:12,270 --> 04:10:12,490
Copy me.

4774
04:10:12,630 --> 04:10:12,690
I'm copying.

4775
04:10:12,690 --> 04:10:15,970
Push up.

4776
04:10:19,020 --> 04:10:19,740
Pushing up.

4777
04:10:19,740 --> 04:10:21,320
What the fuck is this?

4778
04:10:21,700 --> 04:10:23,740
Oh, it's just...

4779
04:10:23,740 --> 04:10:24,180
Oh, it's just...

4780
04:10:24,520 --> 04:10:24,880
Fuck.

4781
04:10:25,800 --> 04:10:26,840
Got the healers.

4782
04:10:27,440 --> 04:10:28,060
Nice, nice, nice.

4783
04:10:28,080 --> 04:10:28,600
Good, good, good, good.

4784
04:10:28,780 --> 04:10:28,940
Nice, nice.

4785
04:10:29,120 --> 04:10:30,000
Help our group.

4786
04:10:30,320 --> 04:10:30,760
It's fine, it's fine.

4787
04:10:32,160 --> 04:10:32,580
There's a group.

4788
04:10:33,480 --> 04:10:34,040
There's one.

4789
04:10:34,160 --> 04:10:34,560
There's one.

4790
04:10:36,000 --> 04:10:36,120
Got him.

4791
04:10:36,140 --> 04:10:36,460
Got him.

4792
04:10:36,460 --> 04:10:36,840
Emma's low.

4793
04:10:37,420 --> 04:10:37,720
Emma's one.

4794
04:10:38,440 --> 04:10:38,600
Help me.

4795
04:10:38,640 --> 04:10:38,880
Help me.

4796
04:10:38,880 --> 04:10:39,000
Help me.

4797
04:10:39,000 --> 04:10:39,040
Help me.

4798
04:10:39,480 --> 04:10:41,200
Oh, that's my bad.

4799
04:10:43,660 --> 04:10:45,620
I really wanted that Emma kill.

4800
04:10:46,400 --> 04:10:46,800
Help her.

4801
04:10:46,920 --> 04:10:47,200
Yeah.

4802
04:10:48,960 --> 04:10:50,020
I was overextended.

4803
04:10:51,000 --> 04:10:52,660
Both Mia and Isa were too hungry for the healers.

4804
04:10:52,820 --> 04:10:53,140
My bad.

4805
04:10:53,820 --> 04:10:54,120
Yeah, no.

4806
04:10:54,320 --> 04:10:55,100
I was, I wanted it too.

4807
04:10:55,320 --> 04:10:56,860
I just ran straight for fucking cloak.

4808
04:10:57,020 --> 04:10:57,640
I was like, I'm eating it.

4809
04:10:57,740 --> 04:10:58,240
Looks good.

4810
04:10:58,320 --> 04:10:58,640
I didn't.

4811
04:10:58,840 --> 04:10:59,620
I didn't want to be.

4812
04:10:59,620 --> 04:11:00,860
I didn't want to be.

4813
04:11:02,360 --> 04:11:03,640
I got all this, I got all this.

4814
04:11:04,780 --> 04:11:05,260
No, no.

4815
04:11:05,380 --> 04:11:05,720
Oh, no.

4816
04:11:05,840 --> 04:11:06,380
I'm Eden.

4817
04:11:08,560 --> 04:11:10,160
I got it to save the...

4818
04:11:10,160 --> 04:11:10,880
I'm saving you for fun.

4819
04:11:10,900 --> 04:11:11,620
Okay, Punisher, okay.

4820
04:11:13,320 --> 04:11:15,340
I can go Moon Knight right now.

4821
04:11:15,840 --> 04:11:16,760
Yeah, go Moon Knight, go Moon Knight.

4822
04:11:16,860 --> 04:11:17,460
There's no reason.

4823
04:11:17,760 --> 04:11:18,200
Okay, well.

4824
04:11:20,060 --> 04:11:20,340
Finisher.

4825
04:11:21,140 --> 04:11:22,400
Oh, never mind.

4826
04:11:23,380 --> 04:11:24,100
Nice, nice, nice.

4827
04:11:26,320 --> 04:11:27,520
Okay, Iron Man, top.

4828
04:11:27,620 --> 04:11:28,600
Iron Man top, Iron Man top.

04:11:28,920 --> 04:11:29,400

4830
04:11:29,400 --> 04:11:29,940
Nice, nice, nice.

I got him, I got him, I got him.

4832
04:11:30,700 --> 04:11:31,460
They're down to both DPS.

4833
04:11:31,660 --> 04:11:31,900
Keep going.

4834
04:11:31,920 --> 04:11:32,200
Keep going.

4835
04:11:32,300 --> 04:11:32,520
Keep going.

4836
04:11:32,540 --> 04:11:33,020
Keep going.

4837
04:11:33,220 --> 04:11:33,440
Yeah, yeah.

4838
04:11:33,940 --> 04:11:34,260

4841
04:11:35,100 --> 04:11:35,580
Help her.

4842
04:11:35,620 --> 04:11:37,720
You gotta be.

4843
04:11:37,900 --> 04:11:38,340
Okay, nice.

4844
04:11:41,680 --> 04:11:42,120
I'm choked.

4845
04:11:42,620 --> 04:11:43,280
Oh, he's fine.

04:11:43,820 --> 04:11:44,020
Get the grip.

4847
04:11:44,380 --> 04:11:46,420
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

4848
04:11:46,420 --> 04:11:46,960

04:13:20,810 --> 04:13:21,030
He's one.

4899
04:13:21,050 --> 04:13:22,010
Ironman dead.

5055
04:16:49,250 --> 04:16:51,190
What is that?

04:21:55,220 --> 04:21:56,460
Oh, it was too far.

04:21:56,680 --> 04:21:56,960

5186
04:22:01,420 --> 04:22:05,300
Just die on point, die on point, die on point, die on point, die on point, die on point, die on point.

5187
04:22:05,300 --> 04:22:05,980

04:22:06,080 --> 04:22:06,760
We have to die here.

5189
04:22:07,840 --> 04:22:08,200
Just die here.

5190
04:22:08,260 --> 04:22:08,580
Just die here.

5191
04:22:08,580 --> 04:22:08,960
We're dead.

5192
04:22:09,060 --> 04:22:09,180
We're dead.

5193
04:22:09,400 --> 04:22:11,180
Yeah, just keep, stay, stay, stay, stay.

5194
04:22:11,260 --> 04:22:12,260

We stay the cop.

5196
04:22:15,120 --> 04:22:16,200
And then we all meet up.

5197
04:22:16,400 --> 04:22:16,920
We all meet up there.

5198
04:22:17,100 --> 04:22:18,540
And then wait, just wait, wait for us.

5199
04:22:18,540 --> 04:22:19,680
You want me to portal?

5204
04:22:21,680 --> 04:22:22,140
We can make it.

5205
04:22:22,180 --> 04:22:22,620
We can make it.

5206
04:22:23,320 --> 04:22:29,440
I was so unlucky because Blur was just waiting for you, like, wouldn't let me use my olive.

5207
04:22:30,000 --> 04:22:31,220
Oh, there's a gap!

5208
04:22:31,600 --> 04:22:31,940
There you are.

5209
04:22:31,940 --> 04:22:32,360
Are you ready?

5210
04:22:32,520 --> 04:22:33,100
There's no more, Jeff.

5211
04:22:33,240 --> 04:22:33,820
I'm switching that thing.

5212
04:22:33,960 --> 04:22:34,080
Okay.

04:22:34,860 --> 04:22:35,780
Oh, we have to go in.

5214
04:22:36,000 --> 04:22:37,120
You can just go in.

5215
04:22:37,220 --> 04:22:37,660
You can just go in there.

5216
04:22:37,880 --> 04:22:39,460
I'll be able to catch it.

5217
04:22:39,460 --> 04:22:39,800

The healers are still in the back.

5228
04:22:57,380 --> 04:22:58,080
They're still boxed in.

5229
04:22:58,240 --> 04:22:58,920

5435
04:32:26,110 --> 04:32:26,190
Yeah.

5436
04:32:27,590 --> 04:32:28,970
What do you do, baby?

5437
04:32:31,950 --> 04:33:40,170
so obviously that game was amazing first of all very fun to watch the first game it looked it looked pretty tough what was the ultimate shift you guys did in the second game to kind of change the tides oh it's easy you want to know what i did what did you do my monitor on this time that's true like i think like they the other teams didn't know we actually had a second dps player that we put on tank so when they target banned our our first dps they were like all right roll swap so then obviously heavenly has an insane hot guy and yes oh my god yeah it was crazy i mean he got target band after that yeah he was too nasty but i'm still getting that w what was the point you should have been brood in the building baby what is he talking about and yes and they obviously target band our support backline too so we had to play an entirely new we haven't really practiced with and usually had to pick up how to play adam for the last two games so really insane that she was able to do that for us it

5438
04:33:40,170 --> 04:34:32,890
was really cool to watch especially the fights towards the end there where it was like two people would drop from each team what what kind of comms are you giving to stand to like in that situation or are you just shutting up and let them do their thing kill oh i guess like when we're down too we just yeah yeah we just be like this week we have the odds to win this fight like just just or like or just die on the card like we all just die on the card saw the card as long as we can and then you know we got some time out of it and we don't get staggered or anything yeah i think most teams had like a really strong player like at least one or two but our team had really good comms and i think that's like ultimately what helped us the most we just listened when we were told what to do yeah we were really like well-rounded which is really nice i feel like we could flex into anything or like most of us could flex into any role that was required which is really helpful that i think gave us like

5439
04:34:32,890 --> 04:35:35,210
an advantage against the other you guys played a lot of different characters and even doki played loki at the end which we didn't see yeah we're like wait what's that about loki doki yeah it's an actual strat like the three three like three tanks three supports so i fucked up how you're supposed to play loki you're supposed to like copy the adam and then do like like basically do like a never ending res fight but then the moment i copied like the storm was like right next to me and i was like oh okay i guess no alts for anyone um but yeah no it's we are all so well rounded like we no one can really target ban us because all of us we're not really one tricks so we're able to like play other types of characters and change your comps um so i'm really proud of my team for that i noticed that you guys also didn't ban uh jeff in the other games did you feel like jeff or you had it on the control on that map he was a problem he was very disruptive it's so yeah and then we figured it out we're

5440
04:35:35,210 --> 04:35:56,530
just like just hold mag out for him like who the is like just slammed off the shark yeah the magneto shield seemed to address a lot of those issues but then storm also was very very frustrating it looked like for you guys to deal with yeah yeah and i think blur in general was just very hard to deal with he's just a good player Very good.

5441
04:35:56,970 --> 04:35:58,150
He's a very flexible player.

5442
04:35:58,150 --> 04:36:00,810
And there's so many moments where the healing battle just seemed like it never ended on both sides.

5443
04:36:01,270 --> 04:36:02,950
Everybody's like, come on, just die.

5444
04:36:03,870 --> 04:36:05,110
Triple support, baby.

5445
04:36:05,950 --> 04:36:06,630
Triple support.

5446
04:36:08,050 --> 04:36:08,330
Yeah.

5447
04:36:08,510 --> 04:36:08,710
Yeah.

5448
04:36:08,890 --> 04:36:12,150
It was kind of from like commentating, it's like, oh, he's gonna die.

5449
04:36:12,190 --> 04:36:12,970
No, he's just full health.

5450
04:36:13,090 --> 04:36:13,570

5451
04:36:17,070 --> 04:36:18,970
