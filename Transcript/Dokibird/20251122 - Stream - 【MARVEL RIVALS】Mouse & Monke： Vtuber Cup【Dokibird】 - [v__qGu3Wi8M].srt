00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:46,290
sorry we're discussing strats i don't want to leak anything
because like we're everyone's trying not to leak anything

17
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,250
because it's best of one and if they know our Everyone's
doing it.

18
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,910
All the teams are doing it.

19
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,670
So, like, if they know our comp, it's, like, GG.

20
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:01,990
Sorry.

21
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,090
All right, there we go.

22
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,630
Yeah, because, like, if they know our comp, it's just Target
ban.

23
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,330
Yeah, it's just, there's no, it's rank bans.

24
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,170
There's no protect.

25
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,590
So, it's, like, straight up, rank bans.

26
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,110
So, you know, they get two bans.

27
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,990
We get two bans, but we're banning at the same time.

28
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:43,150
So like but like people are like research everyone almost
everyone locked their profiles to my team locked their

29
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:50,950
profile as well Because I was like locked a profile because
like I noticed the other Like the cat the usual the the the

30
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:57,250
rival players that actually play this game a lot They all
instantly locked their profiles the moment like when they

31
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,230
started practicing So I was like told my team lock your
profiles like if they're gonna lock it.

32
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,530
We gotta lock it but

33
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:13,890
so so like we're trying not to like everyone everyone is
like oh my gosh i know everyone's also having a lot of fun

34
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:22,630
you know it's obviously it's a lot of fun too but it's very
stressful for me because i got assigned captain um in a

35
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:34,730

you go in you alt immediately you're just going as hard as

61
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:21,080
possible in the first game you let them know who's winning
and it's us oh oh the thought that you can like make a

62
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:28,220
really bad misplay and then just lose and get eliminated is
scaring me that's the scary part yeah yeah yeah i thought

63
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:36,140
like there would be like it's like uh you know round we each
play one game and then we do group stages so it's like yeah

64
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,580
Yeah, but it's best of one and then the two best player
teams you guys have fun

65
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah, yeah, well, it's like it's like it's like we're in
pools and also top 16 at the same time Yeah, you just gotta

Yeah, you guys got a request to join me.

78
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,020
Apparently, I can't invite people.

79
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,540
I don't know why.

80
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,240
All right, so for this, the black backline will play our
usual characters.

81
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,900
The front, you guys go wild.

82
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,480
The other three, you guys go wild.

83
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Pick whatever the fuck you want.

84
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,740
I can play whoever I want.

85
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,280
You guys play whoever the fuck you want.

86
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,040
Let's go!

87
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,140
I know exactly who I'm playing.

88
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,900
Yeah, you guys pay whoever you want, guys.

89
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,780
oh it's because like some of you guys are like in the uh in
the game that's why okay yeah i was in i was in a practice

90
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:53,200
range i was like wondering who am i missing oh you use it
yeah yeah yeah sorry the fps counter blocked you from from

91
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,180
your invite all right i'll queue up i'll queue this up whoa
i wonder who we're playing first i wonder if like we all

92
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,080
play at the same time or it's like one by one because it's
like four hours I was like there's no way because matches

93
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,060
are so fast it's like 20 minutes I was gonna say the first
two matches we played simultaneously yeah I don't know I

94
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,400
don't know if they want to cast both of them simultaneously
yeah so I think they're just like we take turns we literally

95
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:25,940
just wait here one by one until you'll need until like our
game starts again like we're just here watching the other

96
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:35,140
teams play like I guess I'm ready Wait, aren't we team one
though?

97
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,520
We're team what?

98
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,080
We were first on the list.

99
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,360
I assume that makes us team one.

100
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,120
What?

101
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,920

Wait, we are going first.

106
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,440

108
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,500

Thank you for the invite.

316
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,080
Wait, I had a question.

317
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,740
Um, are we, are the two matches going simultaneously or is
one minute?

318
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,360
going at a time and we just all watch the match that's going
on uh every match should be on stream so you can just uh

319
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:44,260
yeah just watch so we're waiting oh okay yeah you can just
like co-stream basically okay okay okay sure yeah we we

320
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:54,940
enabled uh co-streaming for everyone so even on youtube
should be good oh you could you could like just obs it i

321
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:03,080
guess no no uh co-stream for youtube but if you want to you
know broadcast it it's all good yeah okay um i'll talk with

322
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:10,500
production just to make sure we're good there but yeah every
match should be on stream so okay okay okay any other

323
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:21,020
questions uh do we know which team is which teams are going
first yet or no uh the first one is um and i could find out

324
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:27,040
which one i'm having production like organize the whole
thing at this point okay so yeah i'm i'm the event organizer

325
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:34,300
so let me come back to you okay i'll be right back okay
thank you okay thank you yeah no problem have fun maybe i

326
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:43,460
worded those questions kind of weird we got this it's fine i
don't know what that means uh yeah i don't know i think that

327
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:50,280
means we're allowed to stream it like share like like you
can stream to stream yeah okay because it's technically

328
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:57,040
against the rules to stream another partner's content unless
they give you explicit permission oh okay well it's it's one

329
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,660
of those rules where like if you do it and the person gets
mad they can report to you but if no one knows then like you

330
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:08,720
know yeah it's like how you know the game awards they make
you apply to co-stream it yeah it's just that okay but you

331
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:21,420
know other people you know they can't catch everyone so
streamer they can't catch you right right right all right

332
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:28,260

doing another quick match yeah we can we can i think we can

333
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:37,580

we back out it's fine yeah we're already in i'm

334
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,500
still thinking about that team dookie yeah just confirming
uh the first match is team dubie versus team omelette and if

335
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:53,740
you're not playing you know you're you're watching every
match okay cool got it okay that's not that's all best of

336
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:02,080
one so it should be relatively quick make way for the good
luck you got it yeah that's what that's that's what i

337
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,540
thought i was like there's no way they're gonna have us do
like two at a time because they can only commentate on one

338
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:16,800
at a time so we're just gonna wait did he say we have to
watch the um yeah i think so we have to Yeah, well, okay, we

340
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:25,880
You could, like, I can't really put it up on my stream, but
I'll just watch it.

341
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,720

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,930
I'm okay, I'm okay, I forgot I can't crouch in this game.

510
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,250
Go up, go up, go up, go up, go up, go up, go up.

511
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,030
Yeah, sure, yeah.

512
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,290
We ran into this, bro.

513
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,350
I didn't know what that was.

514
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,730
I told you, I play Fortnite when I'm playing group, bro.

515
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,030
Holy shit, you weren't lying.

516
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,330
Oh, I got somebody back there.

517
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,570
Anti-group, anti-group.

518
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,070
He's stuck on the wall.

519
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,570
He doesn't realize the wall is in the ceiling.

520
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,830
He didn't see it coming.

521
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,790
So the Alton Gambit because he's stupid and I hate his
cards.

522
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,630
He's dead.

523
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,550
Good job.

524
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:57,290
Die!

525
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,490
Yeah, I got a little...

526
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,510
Hey, little girl.

527
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,130
It's okay.

528
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,970
If you want to go have fun, you can get off my back.

529
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:09,250
Go ahead.

530
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,830
I'll be here.

531
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,290
He's one.

532
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:11,610
He's one.

533
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,330
I'll be chilling.

534
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,730
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

535
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,770
I don't have cleanse here, so if you get Groot ulted, you're
fucked.

536
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,510
Oh, hell yeah.

537
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,990
This is a free ultimate down this hallway.

538
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,090
Okay, good.

539
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,190
Nice.

540
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,630
All right.

541
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,250
Groot's alone.

542
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:24,690
Yeah.

543
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,790
Boxes are in.

544
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,570
Boxes are in.

545
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:27,390
Nice.

546
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,870
Watch on.

547
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,150
Watch on.

548
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:29,670
Watch on.

549
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:29,870
Watch on.

550
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:30,890
There he goes.

551
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:31,350
Oh.

552
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,410
I got rebuilt around myself.

553
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,130
I'm going to use my, we used my gambit first.

554
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,070
And then we'll copy later.

555
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,230
We'll copy.

556
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:39,890
Oh, wait.

557
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,510
What's this guy?

558
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,470
What are you doing here?

559
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,510
Hey, get off of her.

560
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,670
Leave her alone.

561
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,390
What are you doing here?

562
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,990
Is this guy bothering you, princess?

563
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,070
Oh, my God.

564
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,610
This guy's bothering you.

565
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,250
I got you.

566
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,490
I'm low.

567
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,430
I'm low.

568
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,050
Thank you.

569
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,170
I heard the death ult.

570
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,090
I'm scared.

571
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,470
I need his stuff.

572
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,450
Extermination.

573
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,290
You can ult for this?

574
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,070
I got two.

575
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

576
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:03,790
Oh, this?

577
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:04,590
Nice.

578
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,990
This last fight anyway.

579
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,270
I'm not portal.

580
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,650
I don't think they're gonna portal in quickly, guys.

581
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,410
You don't know.

582
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:13,950
You don't know.

583
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:14,910
You never know.

584
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,110
Sometimes I do it.

585
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,090
I wanted to be there.

586
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,690
Guys, wait for me.

587
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,510
Don't end without me.

588
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,510
Please don't end without me.

589
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,630
Please don't end without me.

590
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,190
Oh, okay.

591
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,610
Yeah, but aren't you doing an interview first?

592
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,500
So, no, Machas aren't starting right away, unless you guys
want to watch at the beginning.

593
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,560
God, Gambit's so cool.

594
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,120
God, he is.

595
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,080
He's so cool.

596
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,700
They're gonna nerf him next season.

597
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,420
There's no way.

598
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,600
Oh, no, no way.

599
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,560
He survives this one.

600
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,720
No, no.

601
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,400
Like, the current top 500 is like majority Gambit play.

602
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:02,460
it's really that makes sense it's so dumb that's crazy what
why is he so cool it's because he has a very loving wife and

603
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,980
he's like a house husband have you seen the picture of her
grabbing the back of his jacket and like dragging him off

604
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:15,600
and it just is manhandled there's one you know like the
motorcycle thing like she's actually like he's like the the

605
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:22,600
little spoon in them on the motorcycle oh of course he is
yeah and rose the one driving the motorcycle that's crazy

606
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,280
the need that.

607
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,580
Oh, he has his own dummy mommy.

608
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,160
Like he's living the life.

609
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,600
Can I heal this one?

610
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,680
Yeah.

611
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,360
Actually, yo, yo, healers.

612
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:35,860
Go GPS.

613
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:36,840
Okay.

614
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,480
So this is important.

615
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,920
Who are the good healers?

616
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,260
All right.

617
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,580
I got this.

618
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:45,760
All right.

619
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,080
I got this.

620
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,220
All right.

621
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,540
I got this first time gaming.

622
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,940
No problem.

623
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,680
Oh, you got it.

624
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,840
Am I the okay?

625
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,440
We have two healers.

626
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:52,660
All right.

627
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,000
We got this.

628
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,360
I mean, you guys can run triple support.

629
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,440
We can always go three.

630
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,340
Yeah, yeah, that's the plan.

631
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,440
I can just go all healers.

632
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,000
Let me just go ahead.

633
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,320
Let me just hit F1 real quick.

634
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:01,920
Okay, let's see.

635
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,820
Each card detonates either heals or does damage.

636
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,660
Okay, okay, that's simple.

637
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,800
I can shield myself now.

638
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,880
This is like life changing.

639
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,420
Whoa.

640
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,740
Raise.

641
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,240
Okay, that's a big heal for everybody.

642
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,240
Oh, and it's a chain heal.

643
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay, okay, okay.

644
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,980
Sometimes I wish we could go back.

645
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,140
Got me a chunk of Cronovium that says we can't.

646
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,480
Oh, yeah, I'm going Loki.

647
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,500
Oh, okay.

648
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,520
Okay.

649
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,660
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

650
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,400
All right,

651
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,560

652
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,340
Oh, I'm ready.

656
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:55,980

I don't know.

770
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,860
We're dead.

771

00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,280
I'm scared.

773
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,000
We don't have to say it anymore.

774
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,520
She just says it herself.

775
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,220
We've trained her well.

776
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,640
That's right, support.

777
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:49,960
Apologize.

778
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,620
It's never, it's always your fault, remember that.

779
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,720
Ever since we were playing ARM, every time I don't heal her,
she hits me.

780
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,120
As she should.

781
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,900

00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,900
We gotta shoot that.

856
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,460
We didn't get him the first.

857
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,860
I'm sorry, I was only holding right click.

858
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,780
I have my ult and I'm so ready.

859
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,480
Just get him.

860
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,540
Just get him out of sight.

861
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,620
Captain America over there.

862
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,440
The second they show up.

863
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,480
Let's go!

864
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,740
Nice.

865
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,960
Well, I've got him too with you.

866
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:35,840
I've got him.

867
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,380
I'm trying to protect you.

868
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,480
It's a good idea.

869
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:40,840
I ulted.

870
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,140
I ulted.

871
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:41,440
I ulted.

872
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,940
What is wrong with what is wrong with you?

873
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,180
Please, please.

874
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,260
Dude, he's on you so bad.

875
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,960
He is on you so bad.

876
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,200
Wait, cap is one.

877
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:55,620
Cap is one.

878
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,920
Oh, beautiful.

879
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:58,400
No, come here.

880
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:58,980
No, come here.

881
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,700
Matter of fact, I'm going to come in this guy and get you.

882
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:01,220
Let's go.

883
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,360
Oh, my God.

884
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,520
That was incredible.

885
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,900
I don't know.

886
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,000
That was crazy.

887
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,420
We didn't know that we won that.

888
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,120
I think we might win with this.

889
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:11,940
We should take this.

890
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,420
Yeah, we should.

891
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:12,620
Yeah.

892
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:22,740
swap everything we learned to see that they're all
everything we've strategized for so it's like is that a bot

893
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:35,030
lobby for no it's quick play guys like there's actual like
no they're just babies yeah yeah okay let's i guess now we

894
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:41,810
can are you playing now uh they should have started right
yeah they should have started right technically i'm gonna

895
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:56,270
check uh they're still talking oh they're still talking
they're still okay okay all right crazy when did they start

896
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:05,270
promptly at four i think that's what i said right now
they're still starting or i guess we can play another or do

897
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,250
we or do we not risk it

898
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:23,700
hello where is that um where is our where is our king i'm
gonna use the bathroom real quick sorry one second okay okay

899
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:36,400
i saw that we can i see the co-stream thing on iron mouse's
channel so we all have to open up the the co-stream i guess

900
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:47,420
because it links it links the mainstream if you click the
co-streaming thing oh okay okay um okay Yeah, our game is

901
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,660
the second one after this because they're streaming it.

902
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,960
Yeah, my chat's asking about it.

903
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,280
They're streaming it like back to back.

904
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,620
They're not streaming it simultaneously.

905
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,420
Oh,

906
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:02,600
my gosh.

907
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:07,140
From these quick play games, I'm going to play way too
impressive on Gambit.

908
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,120
Join Coastream.

909
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:09,300
Yeah.

910
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:20,520
These quick play games, they're very risky because
competitive Gambit is so different from quick play Gambit.

911
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,440
because I know I'm better than like bronze players.

912
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,380
So I'm doing the dumb shit.

913
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,520
I am now co-streaming with them also.

914
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,140
I am also co-streaming, but I don't know what it does.

915
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,800
Oh, it just makes it so that when you click on, they click
on your channel, it links them directly to what stream

916
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,320
you're watching.

917
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,200
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

918
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,820
Yeah, yeah.

919
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,220
Oh, wait, that's so cool.

920
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,360
Yeah, so they're like, oh, what are they watching?

921
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,600
You're like, oh, it's Sea Dogs channel.

922
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,360
Shares them with like everyone.

923
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:53,240
Yeah.

924
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,080
Because they're like, oh this is the main broadcast.

925
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,900
Oh, they're starting, they're starting, they're starting.

926
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,700
Okay, okay.

927
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,640
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna check.

928
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,360
We watch.

929
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,400
Yeah, I'm watching.

930
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:10,940
The main broadcast doesn't have it yet, because I assume
there's a delay, but they're showing what they're playing.

931
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,820
So if I go to her and then hit the button.

932
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,200
Do we just watch her?

933
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,960
I'm just watching what the comps are playing.

934
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,360
Oh, co-streaming.

935
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,780
How does this work?

936
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,040
How do we get in this?

937
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,300
Start coaching.

938
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,600
You just click it.

939
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,540
I don't see it.

940
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,560
I just clicked it.

941
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Oh, that thing.

942
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,380
This thing.

943
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:34,420
Yeah, yeah.

944
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:34,960
Okay.

945
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,720
I'm watching.

946
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,700
Hmm.

947
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,500
Does it show it on our streams or how does this work?

948
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,960
Yeah, Chad, do y'all see it?

949
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:42,780
What is it?

950
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,880
I think it just says who's in the stream.

951
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,460
In their sign.

952
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,640
Oh, so then I still got to pull it out and put an OBS.

953
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,660
Okay.

954
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,980
That is showing the team.

955
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,280
now okay i just want to make sure because i was i didn't
want it to like double up they are doing yeah for sure for

956
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:09,080
sure running okay i'm gonna look at my notes too as well i
don't know they're actually running triple support sorry

957
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:18,840
maybe they decided last minute is that a hawk eye i see yeah
they swap oh yeah they're running oh never mind yeah you're

958
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:24,260
right i knew they're gonna hell and the more they don't get
siloed

959
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:39,120
but is that hell and the more map I don't know oh wait I
wait I do know I have the I have the cheat sheet the cheat

960
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,320
sheet it is that's not an actual hell and the more map

961
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:58,560
the doobster someone's like siloed bad in big season 4 bro
these guys do not know how fucking broken siloed is well

962
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,860
She's so scary.

963
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,320
Sad like is...

964
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:08,960
I felt so bad because I saw Duby kept asking to run scrims
and we were like busy and I was like, I felt really bad.

965
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,560
I wanted to...

966
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:10,900
Yeah.

967
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,380
I think like Scrims... Or maybe she's trying to get Intel.

968
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,700
Yeah, the thing is, normally people don't scrim with the
people within the tournament because like, you know, the

969
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,280
Intel.

970
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,620
So like, in pro play, any teams just scrim EU teams.

971
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,940
So they don't like leak the Intel.

972
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,400
Or they...

973
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:36,100
i've learned a lot against like teams that didn't qualify
basically yeah i've uh i've learned a lot just uh

974
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:41,840
experiencing like scrim stuff i've never done stuff like
this it's kind of cool it's really cool it's a very foreign

975
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:52,620
world to to me i've not played pro esports esports is
awesome when you do fgc because it's not even esports it's

976
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,320
you and like 10 dudes in a bar playing

977
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:06,640
do you remember the one year of um twitchcon in vegas where
we went to that bar and the bar had caught on the on the big

978
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:19,360
tvs oh what i missed that no you were there you got me a
drink at that party i'm gonna tell you that everyone should

979
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:28,480
know i was not there at twitchcon no no no i was physically
i was yeah no i guess it's vegas and every shot was like

980
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:37,280
seven bucks no bro i woke up and just damn yeah no it's
pre-gaming and then there's like pre-warfare and he was he

981
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:44,140
was deep in the trenches both of them are running it hella
no more oh my god i landed and then i had the world's worst

982
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:52,840
hangover for three days crazy yeah i say we've been well i
hella for me is more of an issue than no more is yeah but we

983
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:59,060
can't we can't yeah we don't we don't have we don't have the
space for it yeah that's why it sucks that it's killing so

984
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:09,680
hard i know it's just running everyone over that's what i'm
saying yeah they need to they need to pov sk right now i

985
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:16,200
need to see because because like if you focus sk their team
can still just hit you that's the problem it's not like

986
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:23,300
everyone else doesn't know how to play she plays every hero
at a high you can't focus her either because well yam's

987
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:33,280
gonna beat you in the back of the head oh there's just not
enough bands if it was like if it was uh mr um i guess like

988
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:40,460
the tournament bands then you can because there's enough
bands because you get three bands in tournament play but

989
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:47,660
it's but we don't get three bands like we need we actually
need three bands but we don't get three bands but i think if

990
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:53,280
they went turn advanced versus because i know they're like
oh but we want them to have bro she's not missing we want

991
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,560
them to have fun but like um there's just so many There's
too many characters to have like ring bands in a competitive

992
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,780
environment.

993
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,040
Yeah.

994
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:05,300
I think a lot of the players in this turn will have a
limited hero pool.

995
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,140
Yeah.

996
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,520
Blur, stop fighting and run, gang.

997
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,500
What are you doing?

998
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,980
Oh, God.

999
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,140
The SK flank.

1000
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,540
Yep.

1001
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,220
That's what you guys have to be aware of.

1002
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,120
The thing is, you have to be aware of too.

1003
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,020
Like, she will do that because every good neighbor player
will be flanking.

1004
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:26,920
They are so loud.

1005
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:27,400
Okay.

1006
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:33,600
watching us if we can if non-stop yeah if we can we need to
just keep our comms like as clear as possible so we can hear

1007
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:39,160
when she's there if you if you know where she is just mark
it for me I will anti her and then like we just got killer

1008
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:45,100
instantly like we have to just get out a turn on her yeah
because like drink some water if you haven't don't get

1009
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:57,220
dehydrated and get a headache hey no I think Amelie's team
is very strong they are just because they have just because

1010
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:06,100
like itself is like a hard carry i think that's insane on um
dubie's team who is the one we have to watch out for dubie's

1011
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:15,200
team i would just say is blur blur blur is blur was a blur
is a fps all-rounder he's on everything yeah and also he

1012
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:22,640
used to be uh top 500 i mean he still is he's predator top
500 apex and he's always been like consistently high rank

1013
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:29,020
okay so like You know, it has the FPS.

1014
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:36,840
The thing is, the good thing about triple support is that it
tilts DPS players because it's so hard to kill.

1015
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:46,140
But Helena more allows the Namur to basically try and kill
one of the supports that we just have.

1016
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,180
Also, are they lagging?

1017
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,040
Do you see her pain?

1018
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:48,500
Yeah, yeah.

1019
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,420
Do you see her pain?

1020
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:49,840
It's lagging.

1021
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:50,400
Yeah.

1022
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:50,900
They're lagging.

1023
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,360
The packet loss, man.

1024
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,220
Are they, are, is like, are their POVs lagging too, or is
just the spectator?

1025
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,920
I'm not sure.

1026
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,800
I think it's a few of these.

1027
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,720
Yeah, I don't have the...

1028
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,760
We've been having...

1029
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:10,040
The Cloudflare, like, down thing has been really impacting,
like, our practices and stuff as well.

1030
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,220
Oh.

1031
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,240
Oh, they're lagging, too.

1032
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,260
They should pause it.

1033
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,840
Pause the game if they're lagging, too.

1034
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,100
Do they know that that's a thing you can do?

1035
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,200
Eski knows it.

1036
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,100
She knows that you can pause it.

1037
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,400
So...

1038
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:43,770
just she might not need it i'm genuinely scared of sk like
yeah that's why we have to get sidlock out dude she's gonna

1039
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:54,330
clip farm us no no no no it's fine we just get rid of we as
soon as we turn like if she flanks she's she's fucked

1040
00:56:54,330 --> 00:57:02,090
because we all just turn on her as long as we all turn on
her we're fine okay and then also we can lose if she has a

1041
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,750
health bar it can hit z Yeah.

1042
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:05,410
Like all we have to do is turn on her.

1043
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,750
It's not humanly possible.

1044
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,170
Well, she's built different.

1045
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:11,870
So so are we.

1046
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,010
So scary.

1047
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,370
The power of friendship.

1048
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:18,970
Listen, you might not be able to out mechanic her, but you
can out skill her with your team.

1049
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,430
Yeah, because it's a team game.

1050
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,460
It's a power of friendship.

1051
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,440
It's okay.

1052
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,820
We have a distraction.

1053
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,000
Make it a 5v6.

1054
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,240
Remember that, guys.

1055
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:30,400
Right.

1056
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:30,560
You're right.

1057
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,300
We can make it a 5v6 easily.

1058
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:33,760
Okay.

1059
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:34,240
Okay.

1060
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,440
Duby's team banned Hawkeye and Seiloc.

1061
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,180
And then.

1062
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,500
Yeah, I don't know why the Hawkeye.

1063
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,820
Banned Daredevil and Jeff.

1064
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,340
I think they banned Seiloc to target.

1065
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,280
They tried to target.

1066
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,460
As came.

1067
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,320
It's not worth it.

1068
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,360
She's going to play something else and whoop your ass
anyways.

1069
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:50,860
No, no.

1070
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,500
Seiloc bad is worth it.

1071
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,420
It is worth it.

1072
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,420
Yes, I understand that.

1073
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,620
But the Hawkeye, I don't understand why they banned Hawkeye.

1074
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,140
Because they know that Heavenly Seer.

1075
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,860
Yeah, they knew I was watching.

1076
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,620
That was a, that was for me.

1077
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,650
Oh my god, the solo ulti was insane.

1078
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:11,950
But look, look right now.

1079
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,830
She's throwing everything she's got at them.

1080
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,090
No one has died on the enemy team.

1081
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,210
Yeah, because triple support is literally triple support.

1082
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,530
But as I'm saying, you can still out.

1083
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,370
Yeah, Hunter's her skin.

1084
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:29,150
Also, yeah, I'm going to type something in chat that, like,
type something in chat real quick.

1085
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:30,430
Where's the thing?

1086
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,490
There's so much ash on screen.

1087
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:34,950
There's so much ash.

1088
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:37,590
I really like this skin, actually.

1089
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,530
Oh, interesting.

1090
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:46,850
Oh, y'all got to make that breakable.

1091
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:47,490
Yeah, you see.

1092
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,770
That's got to be.

1093
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,170
That was heartbreaking to see just now.

1094
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,410
Like, look at the what I typed in chat.

1095
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:56,090
Okay, give me a second.

1096
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:04,730
Oh.

1097
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:06,810
Yeah, so this falls apart.

1098
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:07,630
I was watching this game in 480.

1099
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,510
Like, their comp instantly falls apart.

1100
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,330
If we just do that.

1101
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,030
Not Ruhoto.

1102
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:14,230
Not Ruhoto.

1103
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:20,790
naruhoto naruhoto wattashua

1104
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:35,090
okay blur let's see it come on oh and that's overtime oh my
god oh my god that's my boy

1105
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:50,050
If they run Bucky, we have to swap off Loki.

1106
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:51,550
Okay.

1107
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:52,290
Yeah, yeah.

1108
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:52,850
Okay.

1109
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,430
That was great.

1110
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,530
I'll switch to Invis.

1111
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:59,430
Yeah, you guys have to swap between the two.

1112
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,070
I can film.

1113
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:01,070
Okay.

1114
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,920
Cam, I will be right back.

1115
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,160
Yeah.

1116
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:07,780
All good.

1117
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:09,460
Um.

1118
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,720
Oh my gosh.

1119
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,040
Not to add a delay for your upcoming match.

1120
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,320
Surprise SK didn't swap.

1121
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:28,040
lot lucky i just think sk is just really strong on the more
right now with the hell yeah with the hella because she's

1122
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:33,200
really strong with the hella and then i also just think
she's such a like all rounder capable player like she's very

1123
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:44,240
confident her team up enables sk with that added anti-heel
like she could just burst anyone she wants yeah and

1124
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:54,360
they're like make sure to go to the bathroom before you're
before we start your game yeah i'm gonna use the restroom my

1125
01:00:54,360 --> 01:01:03,160
favorite back guys oh it's almost over it's almost our turn
no they have to do this yeah it's only one more round one

1126
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:09,140
more round is like maybe 10 minutes i'm gonna pee that's not
good yeah no no no no go ahead sorry sorry sorry that wasn't

1127
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:16,760
for you i was just i thought it was gonna go longer all
right i'm just looking up what we have to ban here oh we're

1128
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:22,820
getting sure to his team here i think i think we just i
think we just let you ban and like uh not complicate it with

1129
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:34,460
yeah yeah i just need to not on an angela map oh yeah let me
see what they're playing on attack defense yep they're doing

1130
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:50,690
namor again okay lucky Punisher blur is nasty the score no
yeah it's just like you know like it's just a shooter yeah

1131
01:01:50,690 --> 01:02:00,110
yeah it's like literally a wingman it's zero and two right
now or you mean like the the scoreboard yeah no man

1132
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:11,200
like learn knows the moment holy shit he just needs to
target and yanners he's like he's confident that he is a

1133
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,840
better player than yanners because he's been playing fps for
his entire life yeah and then the moment you know you got

1134
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,440
they got a pick and then it's just over I played apex
against him once he ran my shit and I was like alright I get

1135
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:28,260
it I get it man that's crazy some of you sorry just built
differently

1136
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:40,550
um I hope we're not the back-to-back match.

1137
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:41,650
I hope.

1138
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,970
One of us has to be the back-to-back match.

1139
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:45,950
What does that mean?

1140
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:50,670
It means like after our game, we have to play another game
with someone.

1141
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:52,030
Oh my god.

1142
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,810
But it's either us or Chido that has to do it.

1143
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:58,210
That's the thing.

1144
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,510
Dude, he's nasty.

1145
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:00,710
Did you see that shit?

1146
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:01,790
Yeah.

1147
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,070
Oh my god.

1148
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:03,590
What happened?

1149
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,250
Did Blur like...

1150
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,030
He just got a Penta.

1151
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:06,990
That's just...

1152
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:12,170
bucky up that's why like if we know they have a bucky up we
have to save a support out for it we can't like we gotta

1153
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:18,310
like hold it for sure yeah we gotta coordinate the um the
supportals we need to know you guys should figure out who's

1154
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:31,220
going first and who's holding okay okay i need to look at
mine all right oh yeah i need to let me copy my notes here

1155
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:41,100
so whenever we need to ban hella anymore and whenever we
need to ban angela actually okay okay yeah i don't know if i

1156
01:03:41,100 --> 01:04:00,400
should waste a banner angela but grut we'll see this depends
on the map yeah i am grut okay well oh you're doing it again

1157
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:07,780
oh it's so nice wait i think i literally i hate it so much i
They just don't have a support alt for it.

1158
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:08,720
They literally don't.

1159
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,940
They're running all...

1160
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,740
They had a duby alt for it.

1161
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,760
They had a cloak and dagger, but I think she might be dead.

1162
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,620
No, no, I meant the blurs alt.

1163
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,140
They literally don't have...

1164
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:22,780
They just don't save alts for Bucky.

1165
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,020
Oh.

1166
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,260
Yeah, I...

1167
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,240
Amma's team is just an invis and a gambit.

1168
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,580
Yeah, they ran double support.

1169
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,660
They didn't run triple support.

1170
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,480
If they ran triple support, I think...

1171
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:43,500
held the triple no yeah full full respect blur is insane
he's just correct he's just very yeah this is actually crazy

1172
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:50,000
i thought like i honestly thought that sk's team was going
to win this so this is very putting up a very significant

1173
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:10,320
fight by just blur yeah wow he really locked in at the last
second holy i'm back oh my god wow what did i say gang They

1174
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,080
can bleed.

1175
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,640
Even gods can bleed.

1176
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,200
They can bleed.

1177
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,720
I told you.

1178
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,600
Ranked intimidation should never get to your head.

1179
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:20,480
You know what?

1180
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,000
You're so right.

1181
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:21,960

How's he holding all?

1539
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,400
Is he holding all for me to hold my own?

1540
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,300
All right, there it is.

1541

1556
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:22,400
Slip her.

1557
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,360

Last one.

1561
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,480

1562
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,280

1738
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:53,200
the place there but i'm very proud of my team need to be

1739
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:58,500
away from me they're I was so sad.

1740
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,960
I was like, oh my God, I'm scared.

1741
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:00,820
We can correct this gambit.

1742
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:01,780
I want to see it so bad.

1743
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:02,860
Please don't ban gambit.

1744
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,640
Yeah, guys, please don't ban gambit.

1745
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,200
So I couldn't play gambit.

1746
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:07,980
She's not that good on gambit.

1747
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:08,660
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1748
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,720
I had the least amount of practice on gambit.

1749
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:11,860
So don't ban gambit.

1750
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:14,180
Oh my God.

1751
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:16,860
Obviously, going into that game, it was a great go.

1752
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,500
What was your kind of team strategy going into that?

1753
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:21,320
Did you have, did you study your opponent?

1754
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:22,760
Yeah, no, we did.

1755
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:29,940
We actually, I like looked through every team, like what
they played the last two days so like you know like usually

1756
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:34,040
what they're meaning is not actually what they're playing in
a competitive environment so i just looked at their matches

1757
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:39,320
and be like oh they've been playing this comp they've been
playing that comp so or like they only invested all their

1758
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:48,140
time playing on this hero so we knew exactly what to ban
because like target banning is a strat so like if we get rid

1759
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:55,020
of like what they're practicing on the enemy team yeah so So
I know Shoto is a Bucky player, like a good Bucky player.

1760
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:01,940
So because he was on my team for the last VTuber rivals and
he was a really good Bucky player the last time we were in a

1761
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:02,380
team together.

1762
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,320
So I remember that.

1763
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:04,920
And I was like, okay, we got to get Bucky out.

1764
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,700
So that was basically our strat.

1765
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:12,260
I also saw that you were just running in first.

1766
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,700
Your tanks are behind you.

1767
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,980
Were you just trying to be a good leader?

1768
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:16,800
What was going on there?

1769
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,900
It's because like when you Mantisalt, like you get like
insane speed boost.

1770
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:26,360
we're just like mock seven into the support backline because
like they can't do anything because if you have like a

1771
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:32,420
mantis running straight at you what the do you do you know
so it was like watching a freight train yeah yeah because

1772
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:37,500
like my shadow was just to go straight to the support like
and then kill one of their supports because that's like

1773
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:43,640
literally how you play mantis and when you all all right
well well your next game is going to be against team uh team

1774
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:48,960
doobie yeah you have any uh any any strategies or is it all
close to the chest secret you can't tell us oh i can't yeah

1775
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:55,500
no no we can't remove that yeah we actually have like watch
the game oh yeah yeah i'm glad we could rest because like we

1776
01:29:55,500 --> 01:30:02,680
are all like so jittery too so we're like we can calm down
for this next game and then go into the next one uh but i

1777
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:08,080
know we had like notes and stuff too being like okay this
this comp will we have to play this comp and this map will

1778
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:14,620
play this comp and stuff like that so oh wow so it's yeah i
think this is what's fun for me a little planning going on

1779
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:20,020
it's just that's what's fun for me i love competitiveness
because i've watch esports stuff like I watch pro play like

1780
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:27,140

in general like I love esports and I love strategizing and

1781
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:33,300

I know you're like crazy into Nurtz.

1810
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,820
It helps in between matches.

1811
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,700
A couple of Nurtz matches.

1812
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,400
Dude, I got my fidget spinner.

1813
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,280
What is Nurtz is competitive solitaire.

1814
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:07,340
Is this thing on?

1815
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,300
Yeah.

1816
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:09,160
I'm not sure what that is.

1817
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,660
I don't even know how to play solitaire.

1818
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:11,960
You just lost me.

1819
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,860
I don't know what solitaire is.

1820
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:18,080
Solitaire is the card game where you got to take the cards
and make sure they match.

1821
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,620
It's the stacking one, right?

1825
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:58,380
I think, I honestly think that new skin that I got just, you
know, it gassed me the hell up.

1826
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,820
I was talking to my chat before the game and I was like, do

01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,420
No, for real.

01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,920
I want the Phoenix Amma skin, but it's gone forever.

1832
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,080

I need to calm down after that.

1838
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:19,500
My adrenaline was a lot.

1839
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:20,320

Like, he probably doesn't have a cape.

1858
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:40,520
No, you guys don't understand.

1859
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:41,940
They got rid of so much.

1860
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,580
Everyone was practicing so much.

1861
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:52,580
like the other three teams they were all they were all
playing since morning tonight and then yesterday we only had

1862
01:36:52,580 --> 01:37:00,240
our two hours yeah that's all we had as a team together
that's all we had and then we had another two hours trim

1863
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:11,580
today and so i was so nervous and it didn't help that i
enduring stream battlefield it it did not help because i was

1864
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:22,780
like okay i'm gonna join i'll like i'll play with them like
after after the after the the um the endurance room because

1865
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:33,740
it's not going to be that long but it took so long it's like
so long how we screamed against a manager team so we

1866
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:42,540
screamed against like people actually uh who manages uh all
the protein like majority of pro teams in rivals so they

1867
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:48,460
know all the strats and they know all the strats and like
what pro players play and how to counter and everything

1868
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:57,100
because they have to manage the teams and a lot of them are
like decent players too so um interesting um so we asked

1869
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:03,400
them to play specific comps that we know that other teams
are playing around 3 wait um so we asked them to play

1870
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:08,440
specific comps that we know what other teams are playing so
we could practice against them and also doing bands that

1871
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:13,400
they might do at us so but then we only had yeah i don't
think that was right three hours of that so it's not like we

1872
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:22,420
should play against so like that was like how we strategize
the the screen setting um because we're not leaking strats

1873
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:31,660
but they can replicate everybody all the captains have fun
names to say um huge shout out to to super gomez for also

1874
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:37,220
like helping out with coaching and giving me like ideas on
like because like you know i don't know everything about pro

1875
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:39,120
play but Like, you know, he does.

1876
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,660
And he also knows the managers too.

1877
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:43,160
So I asked him if he could set up a scrim.

1878
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:48,200
Like if he could ask the managers, his manager to set up a
scrim for me.

1879
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,580
And then his manager was like, bro, I could, we'll just do a
manager.

1880
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:53,080
Well, bro, you know what?

1881
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:55,700
All us managers, we want to play this game anyway today.

1882
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:56,860
So like, bro.

1883
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:59,780
And then like all the managers got together and like
scrimmed us.

1884
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,000
So that's how we did it.

1885
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,200
Yeah.

1886
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:13,520
yeah and he also like helped coach heavenly he gave like he
gave coaching tips to heavenly and ball to so about to so

1887
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:20,220
like because you know about about Lizard one of our DPS
players so uh he also coached uh heavenly and ball on like

1888
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:30,240
what to do I coach the support players and then he did the
code the tank welcome back no no no we're watching we do not

1889
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:39,600
oh are they starting oh no they've got the lobby ready okay
time to see what they'll say

1890
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:55,200
oh wait is to mother new player what yeah is that why you
guys didn't want me to kill her you put her in a house you

1891
01:39:55,200 --> 01:40:02,200
tortured her yeah i saw that she's unranked yeah i saw she's
unranked so i was like oh okay that makes sense why you guys

1892
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:12,600
are like don't leave her you can't leave her no no survivors
no witnesses because we stagger her so they have to wait

1893
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:24,580
longer for the entire team to get together dude i know she
felt the fear of god in that moment what do i do no mercy

1894
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:34,520
who do you who do you guys think will come out on top in
this match i'm a seam hundred percent i think so too i'm a

1895
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:48,280

1896
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:56,280

the other tank lazu is uh out of position quite a lot yeah

01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:54,250
So she couldn't do anything against us because we were
triple.

1938
01:44:54,870 --> 01:44:55,610
Like we were literally...

1939
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:59,030
She like hit us and then we just heal each other up
instantly.

01:45:36,970 --> 01:45:40,110
Let me reload my thoughts.

1946
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:46,830
Who the fuck is Cream Lord?

Yeah.

1950
01:45:50,530 --> 01:45:51,350
That's awkward.

1951
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:55,630
Look, she didn't have mercy.

1952
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:56,530

She was so young.

1959
01:46:06,430 --> 01:46:10,430
Look, SK didn't have mercy, so why should I have mercy?

1960
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,250
You were first, you said the tone.

01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:15,610
Yeah, she watched you do that when I read I'm doing that

01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:18,670
That's true.

1964
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:24,550
It is what it is.

1965
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:25,510

I don't know.

1977
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:55,900
This car.

1978
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:57,420
Oh, whoops.

1979
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:00,440
What the fuck is that cross here?

1980
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,800
The cogs are turning.

1981
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:03,600
Which one?

1982
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:04,960
The strange?

1983
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:05,780
The strange one?

1984
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:08,660
That's the spread of his bullets for up close.

1985
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:10,580
Oh, what the fuck?

1986
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:11,260
I didn't know that.

1987
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:11,680
What the heck?

1988
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,240
Yeah, it's a really wide crosshair because he's like a
shotgun.

1989
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:18,100
Like, so if you're really close, if you're in that circle,
you can still shoot and hit him if they're low.

1990
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:22,000
That's like, that is a weird ass cross here.

1991
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,080
I just...

1992
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:27,540
Yo, how on earth did SK flank and dare teen die?

1993
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:31,100
What the fuck happened?

1994
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:35,440
Oh my god, this is crazy.

1995
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:42,080
They probably noticed SK is really, she likes to gank a lot.

1996
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:43,580
Mm-mm.

1997
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,200
Okay.

1998
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:47,700
Okay.

1999
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:48,520
Okay.

2000
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:50,620
Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's what I know.

2001
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,460
Like, that's how Namor players play.

2002
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:55,900
You can see Shoto doing the same thing where he just walks
in the back.

2003
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:57,280
The back side.

2004
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:58,860
That was a pretty OK.

2005
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,500
Oh, oh, oh, my God.

2006
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:03,500
No, no, no.

2007
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,740
That is insane.

2008
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:09,620
It's just watching a hydrogen bomb versus baby.

2009
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:11,040
Oh, no, stop.

2010
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,880

us win the rivals with name or two I didn't mention that I

2017
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:11,660
Because his neighbor is actually surprisingly really good
Don't Don't piss off Shoto Yeah like during the VTuber

fucking diffed him.

2020
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:37,100
Like, he tried to magle us, and Shoto, like, Shoto, like,
as, you know, the circle title way thing, he used this title

2021
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:38,740
way thing and blocked the entire magle.

2022
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:40,180
Oh, my God.

2023
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,020

Yeah, I'm, like, with, like, uh, we were like, reflex.

2025
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:44,880
Do they got a touch?

2026
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:45,900
Does that, does that kill you?

2027
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:46,860
Or are you invulnerable?

2028
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:47,640
No, you're invulnerable.

2029
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:49,420
You're, you're literally invincible in there.

2030
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:54,960
So, like, he literally saved the entire team by blocking it
with, with his, like, the title wave shit.

2031
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,900
He said, for my country, for my team.

2032
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:57,420
Yeah.

2033
01:50:58,640 --> 01:50:59,700
This is a clincher.

2034
01:50:59,820 --> 01:50:59,980
What?

2035
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,100
Oh, this shield is nasty.

2036
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:03,780

That's game.

2040
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,560
Oh, look how close it is, though.

2041
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:10,340
Oh, Jesus.

2042
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:11,540

2044
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,000
Can they hold?

2045
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:16,120
Can they hold?

2046
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:20,420
That shit was right at the edge.

2047
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:22,000
It was literally at the tip.

2048
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:24,500
That was so crazy.

2049
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:25,000
What the heck?

2050
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:29,930
Yo.

2051
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:33,110
I think we pissed them off.

2052
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:36,530
And they're like, how dare were they?

2053
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:37,970
I'll take it back.

2054
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:38,850
It wasn't just you.

2055
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:40,010
I think that, oops.

2056
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:53,910
That was nasty.

2057
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:57,290
I actually like the flow of this cup a lot.

2058
01:51:57,430 --> 01:52:00,750
It feels like there's a lot of nice down time and then
there's up time.

2059
01:52:00,930 --> 01:52:02,570
You know, it's not like up, up, up, up, up.

2060
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:07,590
I have the volume at full minus.

2061
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:08,210
Why is it full?

2062
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:08,890
Oh, I don't.

2063
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:18,530
Oh, no, no, no, get off the Punisher.

2064
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:21,130
Bro, you're doing so good.

2065
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:23,050
The boy, what you doing, bro?

2066
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:25,190
This is such a good hold for Namur.

2067
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:28,010
That's such a good hold for Namur as well.

2068
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:32,890
Yeah, this was, this is a good, oh, they're, because they
want to run triple support, triple sup.

2069
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:34,950
They wanted to sustain.

2070
01:52:35,390 --> 01:52:37,550
I'm surprised they're not running three, three, then.

2071
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:49,640
Well, there's no mag, so I guess this Punisher won't be,
like, punished as much.

2072
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:57,980
like Punisher is good on this map too but like his name more
was so clean yeah

Okay, everyone's tied now, so...

2138
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:33,600
If Amma's 0-2, there's no comeback.

2139
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:34,220
No.

2140
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,080
No, she's not 0-2.

2141
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:37,840
Oh, wait, she?

2142
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,140
Oh, yeah, she is.

2143
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:40,000
Yeah, she is.

2144
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,980
Does that mean she's out?

2145
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,460
No, no, she has a chance to...

2146
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:44,920
Oh, wait.

2147
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,220
Yeah, she's out.

2148
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:48,400
Are you sure she's going 1?

2149
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:49,840
She's out.

2150
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:51,820
Yeah, she's out.

2151
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:53,760
Oh, my God.

2152
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:57,020

01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:58,680
Yeah, with Eski.

2154
01:57:58,860 --> 01:58:00,620

Well, we...

2173
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:35,150
Do we know what we're doing for this one?

2174
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:36,510
Yeah, yeah, I got the bands in.

2175
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:37,290
Wait, why is my...

2176
01:59:37,290 --> 01:59:37,950
Okay, I was going to save.

2177
01:59:38,110 --> 01:59:41,130
My game wasn't showing up on my OBS.

2178
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:42,090
I got scared.

2179
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:44,770
I don't know if I can kill Blur.

2180
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:47,610
You gotta for country and for team.

2181
01:59:47,790 --> 01:59:48,050

2182
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:48,650
For team and for country.

2183
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:50,110
I killed Toma.

2184
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:52,050
If I could kill Toma, you could kill Blur.

2185
01:59:52,710 --> 01:59:54,490
You killed Toma because you like stepping on...

2186
01:59:54,490 --> 01:59:55,670
That was like killing a baby.

2187
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:59,410
You were just like, yeah, I love beating up babies and
stepping on ants.

2202
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:11,550
That's so valid.

2203
02:01:12,450 --> 02:01:13,430

2204
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:16,530
Cut all ties for this attorney.

02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,180
I'm going to lose my mind.

2236
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:11,200

We can run Cloak because they don't have Mag.

2247
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:28,840
Nothing can kill you.

2248
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:29,460

2249
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:32,520

No, no, not yet.

2347
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:46,520
Not yet.

2348
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:46,980
Are you all here?

2349
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:47,580
Yeah, do it now.

2350
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:48,440
Yes, yes, yes.

02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:49,480
Go, go, go, go, go.

02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:50,640
Go, go, go.

2353
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:59,440
Femi's alting, Femi's alting.

2354
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:00,660
Oh, my gosh.

2355
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:01,720
Where's our support?

2356
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:03,320
Luna, you can all...

2357
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:03,840
Got him, got him, got him.

2358
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:04,940
Oh, nice thing.

2359
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:07,060
Luna, you can all alt to save this fight.

2360
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:10,940
They're down too.

2361
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:11,400
They're down too.

2362
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:11,880
They're down too.

2363
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:12,280
They're down too.

2364
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:13,480
I'm coming back.

2365
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:13,980
They're boxing in.

2366
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:14,460
They're boxing in.

2367
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:15,020
They're boxing in.

2368
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:15,680
We can kill them.

2369
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:16,340
We can kill them there.

2370
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:16,780
We can kill them there.

2371
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:17,600
All right.

2372
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,120
I'm coming back.

2373
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:19,320
I'm coming.

2374
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:19,820
I'm coming.

2375
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:23,480
Go, go, go, go, go.

2376
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:24,260
Go, go, go, go.

2377
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:26,960
That's huge.

2378
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:28,040
Outside, outside.

2379
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:29,600
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2380
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:30,360
They wasted ulti.

2381
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:30,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2382
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:31,320
They wasted all.

2383
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:31,900
They wasted all.

2384
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:33,360
Amelia.

2385
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:35,140
We don't need, don't use anything.

2386
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:35,760
Don't use anything.

2387
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:36,440
Don't use anything.

2388
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:38,160
Come back.

2389
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,400
Well, I can kill you.

2390
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:40,340
Fuck, okay.

2391
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:42,660
No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

2392
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:44,700
It's fine.

2393
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:49,500
So if they punish it, we have to luna-alt this, but we have
to kite back in that luna-alt.

2394
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:50,380
Okay.

2395
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:55,660
Because, okay, at first we kite back, but if he starts
pushing us aggressively, the luna-alt's, okay?

2396
02:07:56,540 --> 02:07:58,680
Yo, blurs up, blurs up, blurs pushed up.

2397
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,160
Help, help, help!

2398
02:07:59,460 --> 02:07:59,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

2399
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:01,140
I'm backed up.

2400
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:01,700
That's fine, that's fine.

2401
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:05,600
They're gonna punch her all after this, so we have to kite.

2402
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:07,000
Get ready to kite, get ready to kite this.

2403
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:10,180
yeah get out of it.

2404
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:13,140
Oh, I got killed again.

2405
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:14,220
That's fine.

2406
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:16,060
Should I go fantastic and safe, to be honest?

2407
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:16,700
It's fine.

2408
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:17,600
It's fine.

2409
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:19,360
Re-alting.

2410
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:20,420
I'm going to do the fantasy.

2411
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:21,480
I think we can hold it.

2412
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:22,160
I think we can hold it more.

2413
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:22,720
Actually?

2414
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:26,600
That's fine.

2415
02:08:28,060 --> 02:08:28,760
I'm coming back.

2416
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:29,660
Oh, no.

2417
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:30,920
We die on point.

2418
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,280
Die on point.

2419
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:31,620
Die on point.

2420
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:32,020
Die on point.

2421
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:33,260
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2422
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:34,260
Dying.

2423
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:36,320
We have another fight here.

2424
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:38,220
At one point.

2425
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:39,380
Do you want to do fantastic?

2426
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:40,680
I'll be able to get ulti really fast.

2427
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:41,100
All right.

2428
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,220
Or do you want to keep on Eifus?

2429
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:45,260
I think Iron Fist is.

2430
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:45,380
Okay.

2431
02:08:45,860 --> 02:08:47,880
We can like shred tank and then we can just start.

2432
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:49,500
He's just he's just gonna be looking at us.

2433
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:49,800
All right.

2434
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,220
Start going up.

2435
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:52,840
Don't get picked.

2436
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:55,380
All right.

2437
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:56,080
Gotta break it.

2438
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:56,520
Gotta break it.

2439
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:56,880
Gotta break it.

2440
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:58,240
Gotta break it.

2441
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:00,400
Whoever dies first has to play Strange.

2442
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:02,460
I'm Strange right now.

2443
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:03,400
You're a wall.

2444
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:03,680
You're a wall.

2445
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:03,960
You're a wall.

2446
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:04,220
You're a wall.

2447
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:05,240
You're a wall.

2448
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:08,720
Push in, push in!

2449
02:09:09,620 --> 02:09:10,340
Push in!

2450
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:10,960
I am Altinas!

2451
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:11,740
Judge!

2452
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:12,820
Never fall!

2453
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:14,280
Execution!

2454
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:15,720
Oh my god, he's on me.

2455
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,860
Uh, I got walled off.

2456
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:18,900
Oh no!

2457
02:09:19,320 --> 02:09:20,300
Okay, I'm switching to Intestor.

2458
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:21,240
Yeah, yeah.

2459
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:22,460
I think I'm gonna swap.

2460
02:09:22,820 --> 02:09:23,460
I think I'm gonna swap.

2461
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:26,700
We think we need to get damage?

2462
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:27,680
You gotta back out of there.

2463
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:28,420
You gotta back out of there.

2464
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:29,080
You gotta die or back out.

2465
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:30,080
You gotta die or back out.

2466
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:31,080
Oh, you're...

2467
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:32,640
I don't know about damage.

2468
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:36,980
Because they're able to tap us, like, a lot.

2469
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:38,860
I got you, I got you, I got you.

2470
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:39,220
I got you.

2471
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:39,420
I'm good.

2472
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:40,220
I got out.

2473
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:44,380
All right.

2474
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,900
I'm like halfway to my alt again.

2475
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:50,200
All right.

2476
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,280
I'm 70% of my alt.

2477
02:09:55,530 --> 02:09:55,950
What the wrong?

2478
02:09:56,050 --> 02:09:56,990
Did they use Grudal yet?

2479
02:09:57,150 --> 02:09:57,830
Did they already use Grudal?

2480
02:09:58,090 --> 02:09:58,890
No, he did not.

2481
02:09:58,890 --> 02:09:59,210
Okay, okay.

2482
02:09:59,330 --> 02:10:01,570
I'm gonna keep being, I don't have cleanse for it yet.

2483
02:10:02,330 --> 02:10:03,130
He's usually gonna get a cleanse.

2484
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:04,150
I'm, we're five.

2485
02:10:04,230 --> 02:10:04,630
Are shielding.

2486
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:05,470
I walled them off.

2487
02:10:05,550 --> 02:10:05,910
I walled them off.

2488
02:10:06,030 --> 02:10:06,370
I walled them off.

2489
02:10:06,610 --> 02:10:06,790
All right.

2490
02:10:07,290 --> 02:10:08,090
My old, my old.

2491
02:10:09,850 --> 02:10:10,830
I got healers, I got healers.

2492
02:10:10,850 --> 02:10:11,410
They have no healers.

2493
02:10:11,990 --> 02:10:12,430
No more alt.

2494
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:13,130
No more alt.

2495
02:10:13,810 --> 02:10:13,890
No more alt.

2496
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:14,930
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

2497
02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:15,390
I got Hawkeye.

2498
02:10:15,530 --> 02:10:15,950
We can keep pushing.

2499
02:10:16,070 --> 02:10:16,550
Keep pushing.

2500
02:10:16,630 --> 02:10:17,050
Keep pushing.

2501
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:19,130
All right.

2502

Back up.

2503
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:20,390
Back up.

2504
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:20,750

02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:24,050
Back up soon as well.

2506
02:10:24,430 --> 02:10:27,210
We'll use, use his copy.

2507
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:30,610
But if they, yeah, use us, we all, we engage first.

Okay.

2509

Okay.

2510
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:34,690
Do you want me to hang around and like try and get an alt
off on them?

2511
02:10:34,690 --> 02:10:35,830
Oh, the fucking wall came back up.

02:10:59,090 --> 02:11:00,230
Careful, careful, careful, careful.

2531
02:11:00,230 --> 02:11:00,390
They're boxed in.

2532
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:01,510
They're boxed in.

2533
02:11:01,530 --> 02:11:02,350
They're absolutely boxed in.

2534
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:02,650
Yes!

2535
02:11:03,490 --> 02:11:04,390
Punish your dead, punish your dead.

2536
02:11:04,530 --> 02:11:04,990
They have no DPS.

2537
02:11:04,990 --> 02:11:05,510
They've no DPS.

2538
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:06,930
They're both.

2539
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:07,210

02:11:08,990 --> 02:11:09,150

2596
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:24,230
They're porting.

Disgusting conversation combination.

Are we able to, like, somehow target Penny?

2661
02:15:13,050 --> 02:15:15,070

They have no tanks.

2738
02:18:05,550 --> 02:18:05,730
They're racing.

2739
02:18:06,270 --> 02:18:08,250
They're racing.

2740
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:08,890
They're racing.

2741
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:09,950
I'm on focus.

2742
02:18:10,610 --> 02:18:11,030
Group one.

2743
02:18:11,190 --> 02:18:11,530

2745
02:18:12,290 --> 02:18:12,370

2746
02:18:14,310 --> 02:18:14,610

Wolverine.

2751
02:18:21,830 --> 02:18:23,270
They're portally, portally, portally.

2752
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:24,930
Restraint, strange, focus on strange.

2753
02:18:25,170 --> 02:18:26,210
Just strange, just strange.

2754
02:18:26,650 --> 02:18:28,130
Hold on, I'm putting pressure on both healers right here.

2755
02:18:28,170 --> 02:18:28,610
Nice, nice, nice.

2756
02:18:29,770 --> 02:18:30,490
One healer dead.

2757
02:18:31,270 --> 02:18:32,790
I'm blocking, I'm blocking, I'm body blocking.

2758
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:34,390
All right, we're good.

2759
02:18:34,670 --> 02:18:36,190
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2760
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:38,210
Stay on Moon Knight, stay on Moon Knight.

2761
02:18:38,210 --> 02:18:41,830
They're running, okay, if they stay on Penny, stay on Moon
Knight.

2762
02:18:42,470 --> 02:18:44,390
Yeah, they're still on Penny, so we win this.

2763
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:47,210
You need me to switch still, or I feel like I'm kidnapping.

2764
02:18:47,230 --> 02:18:47,770
Yeah, you're good, good, good.

2765
02:18:47,850 --> 02:18:49,790
Just kidnap the Grood non-stop, that's all you have to do.

2766
02:18:52,650 --> 02:18:54,030
Should I be pushing?

2767
02:18:54,330 --> 02:18:54,350
Sorry, Blur.

2768
02:18:54,570 --> 02:18:55,290
You're not grabbing me.

2769
02:18:55,470 --> 02:18:56,150
Easy, big dog.

2770
02:18:56,590 --> 02:18:56,810
That's fine.

2771
02:18:57,270 --> 02:19:00,090
One person push cart and then the rest just push up a bit.

2772
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:02,950
I almost have coffee.

2773

All right.

2774
02:19:04,490 --> 02:19:05,690
I see you in there, dog.

2775
02:19:06,310 --> 02:19:08,730
The moment we use coffee instantly, the moment we get it.

team right after our game so our first and second is

2987
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:20,460
determined by whether or not churdo's team beats dubie's
team okay okay so yeah so nervous we're not we're not the

2988
02:28:20,460 --> 02:28:28,260

so

2992
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:07,660
I'm okay now because I know we're in the finals and I if for
a second it's fine with me.

2993

Never settled Doki.

2994
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:13,900
Never settled.

2995
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:15,580
Aim for the stars.

2996
02:29:16,660 --> 02:29:17,160
I know.

2997
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:18,800
We got it.

2998
02:29:18,820 --> 02:29:19,360
We can win.

2999
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:20,400
We can do it.

3000
02:29:20,480 --> 02:29:21,100
We have the skill.

3001
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,300
Aim for the stars.

3002
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:25,220
Oh my gosh.

3003
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:26,280
Bro, I'm getting one guy.

3004
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:27,920
My chat doesn't even know who's next.

3005
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:29,760
Like they're like, no, it's not.

3006
02:29:29,980 --> 02:29:30,600
No, it guys.

3007
02:29:30,780 --> 02:29:32,180
It's Shona versus Scooby next.

3008
02:29:32,920 --> 02:29:43,040
the graphics are wrong i think oh i'm looking at match order
like if you go back in the vod you can see it um so i don't

3009
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:54,040
i think it's so it was dubie versus joki next is dubie
versus shodo and then next after that is us versus ama if

3010
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:58,660
we're this looks this looks right yeah because it's
whatever's on top goes first and then whatever's on bottom

3011
02:29:58,660 --> 02:29:59,880
goes second yeah

3012
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:03,520
It's not wrong.

3013
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:04,240
I just can't read.

3014
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:06,000
Okay, we got a nice break again.

3015
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:07,420
Duby versus Shoto next.

3016
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:08,660
Oh, okay.

3017
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:10,320
So we get to watch.

3018
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:11,920
I can't read.

3019
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:13,680
I've illustrated that so many times today.

3020
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:19,000
We were playing a scream earlier and there's a button when
you pause, it says continue and then continue.

3021
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:22,500
And I think, wait, no, one says confirm and one says
continue.

3022
02:30:22,660 --> 02:30:25,600
And I just hit continue because continue and confirm look
like the same word.

3023
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:28,840
And I started the game for everyone and Heavenly was eating.

3024
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:30,760
Yeah, oh yeah.

3025
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:33,760

02:33:44,620 --> 02:33:53,420
no i should have terrible gotcha life but gotcha gacha gacha
gacha

3046
02:33:57,380 --> 02:34:20,820
gacha i'm just figuring it out about i think it'd be fun you
know what if like to see who wins the ban

3047
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:36,820
so we've been against both of those teams already right yeah
yeah so yeah oh are they playing a game right yeah so

3048
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:41,980
they're playing they're starting now so the thing is whoever
wins this game we're going to be playing the next and it'll

3049
02:34:41,980 --> 02:34:54,460
be best of three oh so amily is like out yes into you're
you're fully yeah there's no coming yeah okay okay what's

3050
02:34:54,460 --> 02:35:00,560
your pickums for this one which team do you think is coming
out on top honestly it's showedo's team pulled the heck

3051
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:08,620
through that was crazy i i i put money on doobie's team blur
is just so nasty i'm kind of scared of him yeah blur is like

3052
02:35:08,620 --> 02:35:17,740
more more versatile in what he can play we said us was nasty
too but yeah happened okay maybe maybe if we say he's nasty

3053
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:24,800
i think it's because like sk has been doing like flashy
plays like more so like i have to kill people like so she's

3054
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:33,520
like flanking a lot but flanking is farming clips like but
flanking we're going on a tick tock but the thing is

3055
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:40,360
flanking is like you know high reward uh high risk so like
everyone's been turning around on her and the moment she

3056
02:35:40,360 --> 02:35:48,500
dies like the whole the front line like the whole front line
collapses oh i see storm

3057
02:35:58,700 --> 02:36:02,060
ban interesting i

3058
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:22,840
love not banning their bucky is so interesting i think
they're confident going through i mean they're running hella

3059
02:36:22,840 --> 02:36:30,940
namor um oh whoops i forgot to open mouse the stream i was
fucking chats were just looking at me it's gonna be like a

3060
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:36,640
bucky div i can't they're staring at you the Oh, they're
going to run Bucky versus Bucky.

3061
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:38,360
Oh, wait, Storm.

3062
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:39,820
That's interesting.

3063
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:42,140
They didn't run.

3064
02:36:42,460 --> 02:36:45,520
Oh, I guess they did because they were scared of Lur's
Storm.

3065
02:36:47,580 --> 02:36:47,660
Yeah.

3066
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:49,500
Gambit Ben.

3067
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:53,480
Uh.

3068
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:59,280
That doobie, the skin that doobie is wearing, that cloak and
dagger skin, it reminds me of like a Sprite can.

3069
02:37:03,670 --> 02:37:04,630
Sprite sponsor.

3070
02:37:06,450 --> 02:37:06,810
All right.

3071
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:15,860
We get to see his Bucky, guys.

3072
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:21,380
Yeah, well, Blur's not playing Bucky.

3073
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:22,800
Where's my Bucky 1v1?

3074
02:37:23,020 --> 02:37:23,780
What the fuck?

3075
02:37:25,720 --> 02:37:26,100
Oh, my God.

3076
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:27,440
He gets to finally play it.

3077
02:37:27,580 --> 02:37:31,320
The thing is, the reason why I also banned his Bucky, too,
is because I saw his...

3078
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:32,500
I saw all his...

3079
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:34,700
All he's been practicing was Bucky the last two days.

3080
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:35,860
Hmm.

3081
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:41,160
Can he aim good?

3082
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:44,380
That's what he...

3083
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:45,360
That's what Connor said.

3084
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:46,040
I didn't say it.

3085
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:46,740
He said it.

3086
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:01,420
Oh.

3087
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:05,220
Oh, my God.

3088
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:07,640
Yeah, plant the seed.

3089
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:08,340
Plant the wall.

3090
02:38:09,400 --> 02:38:09,700
Uh-huh.

3091
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:10,980
Oh.

3092
02:38:12,260 --> 02:38:13,300
Squid POV.

3093
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:14,520
Nice.

3094
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:16,420
Marvel Rivals.

3095
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:20,800
That's unfortunately that they got domination as their map
too.

3096
02:38:21,460 --> 02:38:26,120
Domination is such a hard, like, it's a very refreshing game
mode in the tournament.

3097
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:26,480
I'm sure.

3098
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:26,880
Yeah.

3099
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:29,580
Because you got to adjust so fast.

3100
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:31,860
Do you know how fast the game is there?

3101
02:38:33,700 --> 02:38:34,960
Looks like Duby's team is winning.

3102
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:39,300
I like that.

3103
02:38:39,740 --> 02:38:41,420
I've never seen this Namor skin.

3104
02:38:41,580 --> 02:38:42,340
What is this?

3105
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:43,820
That's the newest one, right?

3106
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:44,380
It's the Dave the Dead.

3107
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:45,120
Oh, Dave the Dead.

3108
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:46,020
Oh, okay.

3109
02:38:46,220 --> 02:38:47,460
What the hell are you aiming at, man?

3110
02:38:47,460 --> 02:38:48,160
He's so blue.

3111
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:49,660
Lazu's head.

3112
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:53,720
Yeah, it's so blue.

3113
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:55,500
It's so blue.

3114
02:38:55,660 --> 02:38:56,300
He's a smurf.

3115
02:38:56,860 --> 02:38:57,960
The friend is cool, though.

3116
02:38:58,140 --> 02:38:59,500
I really like the front too.

3117
02:38:59,660 --> 02:39:00,420
I don't doubt it.

3118
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:02,160
I'm just saying he's blue as hell.

3119
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:05,600
That's true.

3120
02:39:05,800 --> 02:39:06,420
That's true.

3121
02:39:06,720 --> 02:39:07,600
Oh, my God.

3122
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:08,460
Wow.

3123
02:39:10,420 --> 02:39:11,740
Oh, my God.

3124
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:12,260
Take it back.

3125
02:39:12,380 --> 02:39:12,860
Blur my back.

3126
02:39:13,060 --> 02:39:14,000
See, he's smurfing.

3127
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:16,800
He got him.

3128
02:39:17,820 --> 02:39:18,260
Nice.

3129
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:18,960
That's insane.

3130
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:19,600
Bar.

3131
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:20,340
Oh, my God.

3132
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:20,940
Oh, no.

3133
02:39:25,010 --> 02:39:26,350
Yeah, that is so insane.

3134
02:39:26,550 --> 02:39:27,630
Guys, maybe he is nasty.

3135
02:39:28,110 --> 02:39:29,210
What did I say?

3136
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:39,460
I mean, we did ban, we did the hell of ban, right, on this
team.

3137
02:39:40,180 --> 02:39:43,020
See, that's why we got, yeah, that's why we got rid of the
team up for them.

3138
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:44,220
So they can't, yeah.

3139
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,020
That's why, that's why we did that.

3140
02:39:46,400 --> 02:39:47,400
So they won't have the team up.

3141
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:50,120
Oh, oh, oh, he's, oh, no, he ran her over.

3142
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,180
Oh, do they have a support off?

3143
02:39:54,340 --> 02:39:55,120
They did, they have a Luna.

3144
02:39:55,580 --> 02:39:56,140
I'll be right back.

3145
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:57,080
I gotta use the bathroom.

3146
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:59,580
They have a rocket right after.

Hey, he's dancing.

02:41:01,430 --> 02:41:01,830
He's dancing.

3158
02:41:02,170 --> 02:41:02,650
Hey, he's dancing.

3159
02:41:02,910 --> 02:41:03,610
He's moving.

02:41:09,870 --> 02:41:10,750
Um, um.

3165
02:41:13,190 --> 02:41:13,710
What do you mean?

3166
02:41:15,370 --> 02:41:15,950
Oh, nothing.

3167
02:41:17,190 --> 02:41:17,630
Okay.

3168
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:26,040
Oh!

3169
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:27,460
Did you hear me?

3170
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:35,560
that what did he say he kind of goes i think blur is just
such an annoying person on team dubie

3171
02:41:42,700 --> 02:41:47,220
yeah that more hella combo like the team up is so strong

3172
02:41:56,590 --> 02:41:57,710

3175
02:42:27,220 --> 02:42:33,580
really don't like this map is really hard for me i don't
like this set of maps i feel like i lose a lot I mean, at

3176
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:36,820
least it's played, so I don't think there's like a good
chance of it being played against.

3177
02:42:37,420 --> 02:42:41,100
I think it's just random maps each time, so I don't think it
has any bearing.

3178
02:42:42,180 --> 02:42:42,540
Oh.

3179
02:42:44,660 --> 02:42:45,020
Oh.

3180
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:46,200
Ooh.

3181
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:52,640
I'm like paranoid my stuff is going to turn off because
ESA's stuff turned off.

02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:53,040
I'm sorry.

02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:53,480
No, no.

3184
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:55,420
That's like a chronic problem that I've been having.

3185
02:42:55,580 --> 02:42:57,500
It's just me, and it's just once, and then it stops.

3186
02:42:57,920 --> 02:42:59,320
It's, I don't know what's wrong.

3187
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:02,720
It might be my GPU, but I just got a new one, so it should
be okay.

oh you've planted the seeds of doubt okay sorry my back i'm

No, but we still had to play everyone.

3197
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:13,570
We had to play everyone once.

3198
02:44:13,830 --> 02:44:15,030
We still had to play magic against them.

3199
02:44:15,190 --> 02:44:15,370
I see.

3200
02:44:16,090 --> 02:44:16,350
Yeah.

3201
02:44:16,510 --> 02:44:16,690
Okay.

3202
02:44:17,190 --> 02:44:20,610
But like in the finals, we play against Stubby's team if
they win this.

3203
02:44:21,430 --> 02:44:21,510
Hmm.

3204
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:32,660
I like how excited Connor is.

3205
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:33,480
It's really fun.

3206
02:44:33,960 --> 02:44:35,640
He's a very competitive person, isn't he?

3207
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:37,580
I know he used to play Apex too, a lot.

3208
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:39,400
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

3209
02:44:39,420 --> 02:44:40,320
He had like an Apex.

3210
02:44:40,340 --> 02:44:42,880
He had like an Apex arc, a League arc.

3211
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:43,520

of us we're able to like do that this well we're not having

Tomorrow you will become Chinese.

3760
03:08:26,920 --> 03:08:27,740
I was so stressed out.

03:08:27,740 --> 03:08:28,880
God, I fucking wish.

3762
03:08:29,560 --> 03:08:31,320
I was really stressed out.

3763
03:08:31,420 --> 03:08:37,280
Come on, so listen to creativity of others.

3764
03:08:37,640 --> 03:08:39,500
I thought I muted the soundboard.

3765
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:41,660
How is it still coming through?

3766
03:08:43,660 --> 03:08:44,460
That's insane.

3767
03:08:44,840 --> 03:08:47,540
Oh my, is it like, did you just do it on a go XLR?

3768
03:08:49,480 --> 03:08:52,180
It's a, yeah, it's like, it's a ported through one.

3769
03:08:52,200 --> 03:08:53,880
Yeah, I was like, I fucking mute it.

3770
03:08:54,160 --> 03:09:03,140
all your sound words on this screen i was not having it i
was not having the soundboard shit that is so funny oh my

3771
03:09:03,140 --> 03:09:12,420
god yeah um but oh my gosh i'm just at a really chinese
point in our life um oh she don't want to talk to us no more

3772
03:09:12,420 --> 03:09:21,060
oh sorry i was just associating us you're good you're good
you're good i'm so i'm just you know whatever happened just

3773
03:09:21,060 --> 03:09:26,140
that we made it to the they said we're getting it they said
we're getting a quick break thank oh oh how quick is that

3774
03:09:26,140 --> 03:09:35,360
okay i would say five go get water go use the bathroom order
food yeah it's a five it is five okay okay i'm yeah i know

3775
03:09:35,360 --> 03:09:41,320
that my teammates need to be on my screen to get i know that
um the thing is like my supports aren't even going to go

3776
03:09:41,320 --> 03:09:47,120
straight in anyway the reason why i don't do that for my
supports is that like i i'm more i'm trying to make sure

3777
03:09:47,120 --> 03:09:54,500
because i have to make the reaction quick so like i can't
just like run back and then all I'm focusing on the fact

3778
03:09:54,500 --> 03:09:59,320
that my DPS and tanks are in front of me and they are the
most important people to get the ult.

3779
03:09:59,940 --> 03:10:03,200
So, like, if I have to make a snap decision, I'm not going
to have to...

3780
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:08,580
I'm not going to look back and then make sure everyone's in
my view and then I'll...

3781
03:10:08,580 --> 03:10:14,460
I have to make a snap decision in my ult and be like, these
are the people that I need to do damage, that can do damage.

3782
03:10:18,300 --> 03:10:18,660
Who...

3783
03:10:18,660 --> 03:10:20,320
Are we going up against Duby?

3784
03:10:21,380 --> 03:10:34,200
yeah our next match is with yeah yeah okay best of three
best of three technically we never went to losers so i don't

3785
03:10:34,200 --> 03:10:40,080
think there's losers in this one no there's no i wanted my
extra free one point so it's best two out of our best so we

3786
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:43,320
have to play two times instead of three times or one time

3787
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:53,920
each match they ban they do bans again it's the rank bands
it's the same i think they might just do it they either do

3788
03:10:53,920 --> 03:11:04,600
the same bands or they target new bands to make it work okay
so the thing is um we we have to win two games basically

3789
03:11:04,600 --> 03:11:22,160
instead of one oh wait what the okay i'm trying to remember
what were the bands that we did i mean dubie's team is very

3790
03:11:22,160 --> 03:11:27,280
strong Like, it's just...

3791
03:11:27,280 --> 03:11:27,280
Blur.

3792
03:11:27,540 --> 03:11:28,820
Blur is just a very strong player.

3793
03:11:33,460 --> 03:11:35,680
I forget who we back against them.

3794
03:11:43,340 --> 03:11:45,040
You know what they...

3795
03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:47,180
Do you know what they banned out?

3796
03:11:47,320 --> 03:11:47,680
Oh, yeah.

3797
03:11:47,880 --> 03:11:50,300
I'm gonna look at my history and see what they banned out.

3798
03:11:50,440 --> 03:11:50,760

games have all been very fun yeah well it's because well to

3806
03:13:06,220 --> 03:13:13,280

because we're winning.

3807
03:13:14,320 --> 03:13:16,300
Does that diminish the fun that I'm having?

3808
03:13:16,820 --> 03:13:16,880
No.

3809
03:13:17,100 --> 03:13:17,540
No.

3810
03:13:17,820 --> 03:13:21,560
But we got to give context as to why we're having fun.

3811
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:24,560
We had close games, though.

3812
03:13:24,760 --> 03:13:26,640
Yeah, there are some very tight games.

3813
03:13:26,860 --> 03:13:30,080
I mean, Dewey's team is very strong, so the games have been
very, very tight.

3814
03:13:31,660 --> 03:13:32,920
You know, that was fun.

3815
03:13:33,260 --> 03:13:33,660

03:16:32,650 --> 03:16:34,970

3851
03:16:35,790 --> 03:16:36,310
Okay.

3852
03:16:40,310 --> 03:16:41,950

placements.

03:19:27,670 --> 03:19:28,190
Oh, no!

3898
03:19:28,830 --> 03:19:31,030
I hope they don't ban your gambit.

3899
03:19:31,270 --> 03:19:33,270
I've been loving that Jeffstrat you guys have been doing.

3900
03:19:33,550 --> 03:19:34,950
Oh, wait, the Jeffstrat?

3901
03:19:35,430 --> 03:19:36,350
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3902
03:19:36,350 --> 03:19:38,170
Yeah, yeah, they don't know what we're...

3903
03:19:38,170 --> 03:19:38,710
Oh, are you, Jeff?

3904
03:19:38,710 --> 03:19:39,050
Yeah, yeah.

3905
03:19:39,110 --> 03:19:41,150
We're preventing the stream snipers.

3906
03:19:42,390 --> 03:19:42,870
Ooh.

3907
03:19:43,110 --> 03:19:46,090
So, you guys had that game against 2B.

3908
03:19:46,190 --> 03:19:53,550
It was very close it was yeah did you expect it to be that
close were you i did because um i know that some of the

3909
03:19:53,550 --> 03:20:00,750
players on dubious teams and like what they play i know like
ugly is one them i know blur is a very very good fps player

3910
03:20:00,750 --> 03:20:08,350
because he is apex predator um for many seasons so like i
know he's a very he basically his fps skills can transfer to

3911
03:20:08,350 --> 03:20:17,530
any game so okay um so like i knew his cps was really strong
um and they're very coordinated too and he's very flexible

3912
03:20:17,530 --> 03:20:23,950
so like he could play a lot of characters so like a lot of
things yeah so like we can't really target ban him so um at

3913
03:20:23,950 --> 03:20:31,890
best like we try our best to like strategically what can we
survive like at the most makes sense and you know there's

3914
03:20:31,890 --> 03:20:38,450
some ults that we can't survive so we have to ban that true
is there any strategy change you're gonna do going into this

3915
03:20:38,450 --> 03:20:45,930
or you just play in the same game and how can it goes like
it really depends on what they're trying to ban because we

3916
03:20:45,930 --> 03:20:52,890
know our band line um and so it's like what if obviously
they want to try and ban something else on us because their

3917
03:20:52,890 --> 03:20:58,210
first band line didn't work out i mean it did but like in a
way where they want to win the next game so obviously

3918
03:20:58,210 --> 03:21:04,810
they'll try to do a different ban to see which will actually
have help them win the game so our strategy just depends on

3919
03:21:04,810 --> 03:21:11,930
what their band line is because that's how our comps change
instantly interesting you i i've seen your text channel you

3920
03:21:11,930 --> 03:21:20,270
guys have got like the Bible of strategies to look at the
little notepad that I used it right there's so many notepads

3921
03:21:20,270 --> 03:21:27,630
of like if this happens it's like a flowchart extravaganza
like a little flowchart if they banned this we go to this if

3922
03:21:27,630 --> 03:21:37,070
they banned that we go to this like but my team yeah and my
because I'm looking at it right now like whoa okay because

3923
03:21:37,070 --> 03:21:45,990
that's what rivals is like usually it's not it's like it's
not really about like for esports it's not about who has the

3924
03:21:45,990 --> 03:21:53,430
best individual play like best team players it's also about
like the band line too because it changes everything so it's

3925
03:21:53,430 --> 03:21:58,770
like rock paper scissors so if they if someone messes up the
band line if a team messes up the band line it's over

3926
03:21:58,770 --> 03:22:08,550
because the other team has a better comp that can rock paper
scissors your comp so it's literally like a mind game all

3927
03:22:08,550 --> 03:22:13,570
right i guess we'll we'll see how it goes in this final best
of three good luck and thanks for putting on the show so far

3928
03:22:13,570 --> 03:22:21,290

So if we win two, then...

3983
03:24:36,620 --> 03:24:47,480
them all right let's see what they're gonna ban i'm curious
what are you gonna do here what's they banning what's this

3984
03:24:47,480 --> 03:24:56,220
is the bat like i'm curious what their new bad line is gonna
be oh okay i knew it i knew it okay i think they're gonna

3985
03:24:56,220 --> 03:25:09,120
ban fantastic next is this the name room oh yeah yeah yeah
yeah those are good bands we did last time if it doesn't

3986
03:25:09,120 --> 03:25:16,100
work we can i like when we ban hella because like i like
when we ban hella because i can still play no more yeah more

3987
03:25:19,080 --> 03:25:28,780
all right let's see okay oh my god all my damn support all
right i'm not judging

3988
03:25:36,300 --> 03:25:48,480
oh this is domination okay all right so if they run they
might run wolf here okay so that's why that's why they take

3989
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:55,140
the push they take the seal away so they could have a chance
to run well if they pick wolf should i go back to group

3990
03:25:55,140 --> 03:26:01,700
because i can just not get picked up no you don't go grew
when you're when you're against all right do you feel

3991
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:09,060
confident do you feel confident going against wolf yeah yeah
because with the new change to his e i can't get grabbed

3992
03:26:09,060 --> 03:26:15,540
anymore so if he can't and i'm on i'm a mantis i'm a mantis
yeah yeah do it i'm a I think it would be okay.

3993
03:26:16,280 --> 03:26:17,820
If it doesn't work, just watch the map.

3994
03:26:18,080 --> 03:26:18,300

3995
03:26:18,640 --> 03:26:19,920

Strange.

4000
03:26:24,220 --> 03:26:25,480
Oh, they might need to pause.

4001
03:26:25,880 --> 03:26:26,560
They might need a pause.

4002
03:26:28,120 --> 03:26:29,520
They might need a pause.

4003
03:26:29,960 --> 03:26:30,160
Yeah.

4004
03:26:31,200 --> 03:26:31,640

It wasn't.

4093
03:30:53,350 --> 03:30:55,710
The second I ulted, I knew he would waste his two.

4094
03:30:56,070 --> 03:30:56,990
And he got nothing for it.

4095
03:30:58,850 --> 03:31:02,370

do.

4182
03:33:16,590 --> 03:33:16,870
I'm shooting Storm.

4183
03:33:17,210 --> 03:33:18,990
I'm going to portal.

03:33:31,190 --> 03:33:31,470
You're on the point.

Undefeatable.

4197
03:33:40,790 --> 03:33:41,350
It is.

4198
03:33:41,550 --> 03:33:43,150
I didn't get any of the healers in the hall, unfortunately.

4199
03:33:44,810 --> 03:33:45,570

4217
03:34:04,670 --> 03:34:05,230

03:34:46,350 --> 03:34:48,090
We might need mag out for the Jeff ult.

4228
03:34:48,450 --> 03:34:49,790
You might have to go mag for that.

4229
03:34:49,930 --> 03:34:51,950
You have to save your mag out just for the Jeff E.

4230
03:34:52,590 --> 03:34:55,490
Because no one else can kill the Jeff right now.

4231
03:34:55,630 --> 03:34:57,370
Or should I go cloak for the Jeff ult?

4232
03:34:58,210 --> 03:34:59,090

4274
03:36:24,550 --> 03:36:25,370
We didn't need that.

4275
03:36:25,650 --> 03:36:25,850

4279
03:36:30,650 --> 03:36:31,170

4282
03:36:33,630 --> 03:36:34,370
I can't get him.

4283
03:36:35,570 --> 03:36:38,010
All right, so we're going to use my alt to engage here.

4284
03:36:38,270 --> 03:36:38,590

03:36:41,550 --> 03:36:41,930
Mine.

03:36:45,530 --> 03:36:46,430

They're cutting you.

4293
03:36:52,050 --> 03:36:53,050
They're going to try and kite it.

4294
03:36:54,310 --> 03:36:54,790
Good one.

4295
03:36:55,570 --> 03:36:56,330
Oh, I got it.

4296
03:36:56,790 --> 03:36:57,170

4300
03:37:02,950 --> 03:37:03,590
She's alone.

4301
03:37:03,730 --> 03:37:04,170
Kill this.

4302
03:37:04,430 --> 03:37:05,230
Panny, Panny, Panny, Panny.

4303
03:37:05,990 --> 03:37:06,790
I'm alting, I'm alting.

4304
03:37:07,010 --> 03:37:07,130
I'm alting.

4305
03:37:07,270 --> 03:37:07,430
Look at the gold.

4306
03:37:07,510 --> 03:37:07,750
Get out.

4307
03:37:09,870 --> 03:37:10,730
Pull them to the wall.

4308
03:37:10,770 --> 03:37:11,410
What the hell's going on?

4309
03:37:11,550 --> 03:37:12,050
It's just a mass moving.

4310
03:37:12,130 --> 03:37:12,690
It's just a mass moving.

4311
03:37:12,930 --> 03:37:14,870
God damn it.

4312
03:37:15,690 --> 03:37:16,050
Man.

4313
03:37:18,730 --> 03:37:19,550
We don't have support else here.

4314
03:37:19,670 --> 03:37:20,110
We have to...

4315
03:37:20,950 --> 03:37:21,450
I'm low.

4316
03:37:22,130 --> 03:37:22,790
I guess I got Penny.

4317
03:37:22,950 --> 03:37:23,070
I got Penny.

4318
03:37:23,350 --> 03:37:23,410
I got Penny.

4319
03:37:23,570 --> 03:37:24,210
Penny did.

4320
03:37:24,450 --> 03:37:24,810
He ate me.

4321
03:37:25,490 --> 03:37:26,050
He ate me.

4322
03:37:26,790 --> 03:37:27,050
I died.

4323
03:37:27,630 --> 03:37:28,230
Oh my god.

4324
03:37:28,350 --> 03:37:28,590
I can't.

4325
03:37:28,730 --> 03:37:29,190
I can't kill him.

4326
03:37:29,270 --> 03:37:29,770
I can't kill him.

4327
03:37:29,910 --> 03:37:30,010
Yeah.

4328
03:37:32,170 --> 03:37:32,930
We're going to need mag.

4329
03:37:33,010 --> 03:37:35,350
Swap to mag here.

4330
03:37:38,690 --> 03:37:39,690

4331
03:37:39,930 --> 03:37:40,150

03:37:43,810 --> 03:37:44,970
I got you, I got you.

4335
03:37:45,170 --> 03:37:48,750

I have my ult.

4340
03:37:55,810 --> 03:37:56,530
We can push with it.

03:37:56,770 --> 03:37:57,150
Yeah, nice.

4342
03:37:59,270 --> 03:37:59,810
Do they have shields?

4343
03:38:00,550 --> 03:38:00,750
No.

4344
03:38:01,190 --> 03:38:02,570
They're gonna have Munayel though.

We have to shoot it.

4350
03:38:07,510 --> 03:38:08,250
We just have to shoot it.

4351
03:38:08,590 --> 03:38:09,030
We batted it.

4352
03:38:09,110 --> 03:38:09,370

03:38:13,010 --> 03:38:14,010
We had to shoot that.

4356
03:38:15,250 --> 03:38:15,530
It's fine.

4357
03:38:15,650 --> 03:38:15,970
Bye, bye, bye.

She's grabbing me.

4371
03:38:30,050 --> 03:38:30,610
Cloak off this.

4372
03:38:30,950 --> 03:38:32,910

03:39:50,040 --> 03:39:51,660
Jeffy, Meg, remember to give it, give it.

4414
03:39:51,820 --> 03:39:52,160
Here, here.

4415
03:39:53,200 --> 03:39:53,960
Oh, what?

4416
03:39:54,180 --> 03:39:55,500
He did, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

4417
03:39:56,020 --> 03:39:56,920
Oh, blur you bitch.

4418
03:39:57,360 --> 03:39:58,740
He's fucking ultimate on top of me.

4419
03:39:59,020 --> 03:40:00,140
I'm getting fucking juggled.

4420
03:40:00,540 --> 03:40:01,900
Oh, I'm gonna swap.

4421
03:40:02,200 --> 03:40:03,180
Someone has to swap to Strange.

4422
03:40:04,020 --> 03:40:04,440
Okay, okay.

4423
03:40:04,800 --> 03:40:05,660
Actually, I got it, I got it, I got it.

4424
03:40:05,860 --> 03:40:05,880
I got it, I got it.

4425
03:40:07,580 --> 03:40:08,340
Someone guard me?

4426
03:40:09,660 --> 03:40:09,860
What?

4427
03:40:10,820 --> 03:40:11,520
Oh my God, what?

4428
03:40:11,740 --> 03:40:12,300

I'm lucky.

4433
03:40:16,360 --> 03:40:16,740
It's okay, it's okay.

4434
03:40:17,100 --> 03:40:17,680
It's okay.

4438
03:40:46,120 --> 03:40:49,700
don't we ban him next time it's just this This map is a Jeff
map.

4439
03:40:49,980 --> 03:40:50,680
This is a Jeff map.

4440
03:40:51,320 --> 03:40:51,400
Okay.

4441
03:40:51,780 --> 03:40:51,800
Okay.

4442
03:40:53,300 --> 03:40:53,700
Don't worry.

4443
03:40:55,820 --> 03:40:56,920
We still got two more.

4444
03:40:57,920 --> 03:40:58,780
We've done worse.

4445
03:41:02,940 --> 03:41:06,120
The thing is, we- we have to swap Loki off.

4446
03:41:11,240 --> 03:41:17,060
We have to focus on- Okay, let me figure out this bad line.

4447
03:41:20,180 --> 03:41:28,940
because we don't want to give them bucky no so we keep that
dead we have to keep the bucky ben and the thing is we have

4448
03:41:28,940 --> 03:41:37,940
to shoot on the map we have to shoot the storm that's like
we pick we pick the map oh we picked on this one oh um how

4449
03:41:37,940 --> 03:41:45,800
much time do we have 27 seconds 30 seconds oh fuck i didn't
know we were gonna pick the map are we doing convergence of

Okay, we ban Storm.

4463
03:42:58,120 --> 03:42:58,300
All right.

4464
03:43:06,120 --> 03:43:07,420
Is this not a name right, Matt?

4465

03:43:10,040 --> 03:43:10,860
Yeah, this is.

4467
03:43:10,880 --> 03:43:11,120
Oh, wait.

4468
03:43:11,140 --> 03:43:11,680
This is a hell map.

4469
03:43:11,780 --> 03:43:13,260
Ben, hell, a banana, a banana, a banana, a banana.

4470
03:43:13,260 --> 03:43:13,660

4474
03:43:26,040 --> 03:43:27,740
We actually wanted to ban... Oh no.

4475
03:43:28,200 --> 03:43:28,800
We can make it work.

4476
03:43:28,960 --> 03:43:29,600
We can just play home.

4477
03:43:29,600 --> 03:43:29,760
We can just play home.

4478
03:43:29,840 --> 03:43:32,000
Hell, like, can you... Can we honor that?

4479
03:43:34,300 --> 03:43:35,820
We had a joke.

4480
03:43:36,380 --> 03:43:36,460
Yeah.

4481
03:43:38,980 --> 03:43:40,540
Majority of us pick.

4482
03:43:42,940 --> 03:43:43,680
Fuck no.

4483
03:43:43,820 --> 03:43:44,420
They're gonna say no.

4484
03:43:44,540 --> 03:43:46,660
We're gonna need to restart this if we want to do that.

4485
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:47,140
Yeah.

4486
03:43:50,320 --> 03:43:52,460
I didn't really realize...

4487
03:43:54,460 --> 03:44:04,120
hella if they don't hella instead of storm is our bad line
but they can't get storm we have to we have to restart oh we

4488
03:44:04,120 --> 03:44:10,300
don't yeah can we start lobby and restart and you'll honor
honor the map

4489
03:44:16,020 --> 03:44:31,100
30 seconds before you attack get ready i'll do it yeah we'll
honor same bands the same bands and same maps except for

4490
03:44:31,100 --> 03:44:33,680
hella over storm.

4491
03:44:35,340 --> 03:44:36,120
Yeah, there you go.

4492
03:44:36,420 --> 03:44:37,020
That was unfortunate.

4493
03:44:37,360 --> 03:44:37,940
For sure, for sure.

4494
03:44:39,320 --> 03:44:40,840
I forgot that we were on that map.

4495
03:44:44,510 --> 03:44:44,850
It's okay.

4496
03:44:44,930 --> 03:44:45,190
It's okay.

4497
03:44:46,550 --> 03:44:47,430
They want to know if you're ready.

4498
03:44:48,570 --> 03:44:48,610
Yeah.

4499
03:44:50,910 --> 03:44:51,350
Alright.

4500
03:44:52,810 --> 03:44:55,590
We have to down hard because that was a whole map too.

4501
03:44:56,110 --> 03:44:57,150
It fucking sucks.

4502
03:44:57,430 --> 03:44:58,690
My thing lagged.

4503
03:44:58,930 --> 03:45:00,830
I couldn't like pick it.

4504
03:45:01,490 --> 03:45:02,210
It wasn't only me.

4505
03:45:02,330 --> 03:45:03,730
Was I the only one allowed to pick the map?

4506
03:45:04,850 --> 03:45:05,230
Yeah.

4507
03:45:06,570 --> 03:45:07,110
Yeah.

4508
03:45:10,010 --> 03:45:10,290
Yeah.

4509
03:45:10,290 --> 03:45:10,930
Oh, they're...

4510
03:45:11,510 --> 03:45:11,770
Okay.

4511
03:45:15,460 --> 03:45:16,820
We're in China.

4512
03:45:19,040 --> 03:45:22,160
Oh, my poor Biao, baby.

4513
03:45:23,380 --> 03:45:24,040
Oh, she is.

4514
03:45:25,220 --> 03:45:25,540
Oh, man.

4515
03:45:26,600 --> 03:45:28,120
Oh, jean.

4516
03:45:28,920 --> 03:45:30,200
Oh, fucking.

4517
03:45:33,380 --> 03:45:37,640
Wow, you're more Chinese than I am.

4518
03:45:38,100 --> 03:45:40,240
You've caught me in a very Chinese part of my life.

4519
03:45:40,340 --> 03:45:42,060
I am banished in this match.

4520
03:45:42,300 --> 03:45:43,000
I went to pick Jeff.

4521
03:45:43,840 --> 03:45:44,320
What are we doing?

4522
03:45:44,440 --> 03:45:44,940
It doesn't matter.

4523
03:45:45,080 --> 03:45:45,440
It's okay.

4524
03:45:46,520 --> 03:45:47,320
So, Ben.

4525
03:45:48,280 --> 03:45:49,880
Ben, Bucky, Hella.

4526
03:45:50,180 --> 03:45:51,100
We just got to honor that.

4527
03:45:59,280 --> 03:46:00,220
Who did they ban again?

4528
03:46:00,400 --> 03:46:01,640
What support did you want me on?

4529
03:46:02,420 --> 03:46:04,260
If they run, we run Loki first.

4530
03:46:04,340 --> 03:46:06,160
If they run Moon Knight, you swap off.

4531
03:46:06,180 --> 03:46:16,200
a low key instantly okay for res you have um you have to
wait until two people die and don't res in the middle of the

4532
03:46:16,200 --> 03:46:25,220
point that's really it um but like the most ideal playing a
storm we have to play luna that's the most ideal but with

4533
03:46:25,220 --> 03:46:34,080
that your hero pool is so limited because if we play luna
you have to play either we could try and make adam work but

4534
03:46:34,080 --> 03:46:47,180
i also have to swap to something because we need to play
Luna against like Storm okay I can't we can go fuck okay we

4535
03:46:47,180 --> 03:46:54,940
can try and go Rocket, Luna, Loki for now Rocket, Luna, Loki
yeah

4536
03:47:01,010 --> 03:47:14,210
I like this I like this alright, we got this so Luna will
focus on the we'll focus on alting for storm and we have to

4537
03:47:14,210 --> 03:47:23,150
I think if they have a storm we need a hit scan we need a
hit scan you need you know I played Punisher heavenly yeah

4538
03:47:23,150 --> 03:47:37,070
okay we might have to run Emma I'm playing back Emma
Punisher I'm a Punisher all right yes sir I need you to be

4539
03:47:37,070 --> 03:47:39,470
on Punisher they're on storm

4540
03:47:45,180 --> 03:47:46,720
Or do you know how to play Phoenix?

4541
03:47:47,080 --> 03:47:48,280
Phoenix is the best character against Storm.

4542
03:47:50,100 --> 03:47:51,380
I have it later yet.

4543
03:47:51,400 --> 03:47:51,780
It's fine.

4544
03:47:51,980 --> 03:47:52,880
We can try and make this.

4545
03:47:53,160 --> 03:47:53,560
Yeah, yeah.

4546
03:47:54,280 --> 03:47:56,060
All you need to do is capture the mission.

4547
03:47:56,160 --> 03:47:57,720
Kind of unfortunate because...

4548
03:47:57,720 --> 03:47:58,380
Don't go too far.

4549
03:47:58,600 --> 03:48:00,220
Don't go too far.

4550
03:48:00,720 --> 03:48:01,640
Don't go too far.

4551
03:48:02,060 --> 03:48:02,600
Swap up Loki.

4552
03:48:02,880 --> 03:48:03,240
Swap up Loki.

4553
03:48:03,480 --> 03:48:03,720
I just wanted to.

4554
03:48:04,180 --> 03:48:04,860
I just need the vision.

4555
03:48:05,060 --> 03:48:05,220
Yeah.

4556
03:48:05,640 --> 03:48:06,580
There's no reason to play it.

4557
03:48:06,660 --> 03:48:07,680
I'm going to use this to replace.

4558
03:48:08,020 --> 03:48:08,200
Yeah.

4559
03:48:09,540 --> 03:48:10,880
Up top, up top, up top.

4560
03:48:11,580 --> 03:48:12,280
I was fine.

4561
03:48:12,440 --> 03:48:12,920
We're not up top.

4562
03:48:13,220 --> 03:48:14,360
We need someone to...

4563
03:48:14,380 --> 03:48:16,580
Oh, the server's lagging.

4564
03:48:16,900 --> 03:48:17,780
Okay, that's fine.

4565
03:48:18,300 --> 03:48:20,360
It keeps lagging on this map specifically, I noticed.

4566
03:48:20,860 --> 03:48:21,760
Too much fog.

4567
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:23,920
They have a storm.

4568
03:48:24,820 --> 03:48:27,240
They have a storm, but our Punisher is going to be dealing
with that.

4569
03:48:27,440 --> 03:48:29,160
That fucked up so bad.

4570
03:48:29,420 --> 03:48:30,100
My hook did not.

4571
03:48:30,120 --> 03:48:30,900
Hopefully it was a hook.

4572
03:48:31,060 --> 03:48:31,560
Okay, okay, okay.

4573
03:48:31,820 --> 03:48:32,200
We have Res.

4574
03:48:32,280 --> 03:48:32,660
We have Res.

4575
03:48:32,980 --> 03:48:33,120
Res here.

4576
03:48:33,220 --> 03:48:34,300
Yeah, we have.

4577
03:48:35,540 --> 03:48:36,780
Can we get Moon Knight up there still?

4578
03:48:37,240 --> 03:48:37,960
I can't get him.

4579
03:48:38,140 --> 03:48:38,460
Yeah, yeah.

4580
03:48:38,580 --> 03:48:39,740
They both focused me at the same time.

4581
03:48:41,980 --> 03:48:42,900
Oh, behind, behind.

4582
03:48:43,200 --> 03:48:43,400

03:54:32,300 --> 03:54:32,640
Don't fight this.

4820
03:54:32,700 --> 03:54:32,820

04:03:46,890 --> 04:03:47,690
Focus on my alt.

5122
04:03:48,250 --> 04:03:48,910
They're on the back.

5123
04:03:49,130 --> 04:03:50,250
Support, support, support, support.

5124
04:03:50,470 --> 04:03:50,770
Yeah, we're good.

5125
04:03:51,470 --> 04:03:52,330
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

5126
04:03:52,430 --> 04:03:52,650
Focus on Jeff.

5127
04:03:53,130 --> 04:03:53,570
Focus on Jeff.

5128
04:03:55,530 --> 04:03:56,270
Focus on Jeff.

5129
04:03:58,110 --> 04:03:59,150
He's a slippery one.

5130
04:03:59,370 --> 04:04:00,910
Can we get the rocket ulti, please?

5131
04:04:01,010 --> 04:04:01,390
I'm getting it.

5132
04:04:01,470 --> 04:04:01,790
I'm getting it.

5133
04:04:01,850 --> 04:04:02,110
I'm on it.

5134
04:04:02,190 --> 04:04:02,410
I'm on it.

5135
04:04:02,470 --> 04:04:02,770
Thank you, thank you.

5136
04:04:03,130 --> 04:04:03,850
Focus, Jeff, please.

5137
04:04:03,930 --> 04:04:04,450
Focus, Jeff, please.

5138
04:04:04,710 --> 04:04:05,570
Jeff is the only one with ult.

5139
04:04:05,570 --> 04:04:06,550
Got him!

5140
04:04:06,670 --> 04:04:07,870
Got him!

5141
04:04:08,030 --> 04:04:09,230
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

5142
04:04:15,600 --> 04:04:16,400
Punisher dead!

5143
04:04:16,880 --> 04:04:20,760
Here comes Rocket!

5144
04:04:21,900 --> 04:04:22,700
Jeff is coming back!

5145
04:04:23,000 --> 04:04:23,420
Great is one!

5146
04:04:24,020 --> 04:04:24,740
Great is one!

5147
04:04:24,840 --> 04:04:25,100
Good is one!

5148
04:04:25,560 --> 04:04:25,700

5149
04:04:26,060 --> 04:04:26,440
Nice!

5150
04:04:26,700 --> 04:04:27,220
Rocket!

5151
04:04:27,480 --> 04:04:27,820
Change me!

5152
04:04:27,820 --> 04:04:28,240
Change me!

5153
04:04:28,640 --> 04:04:28,740
Rocket!

5154
04:04:29,340 --> 04:04:29,340
Rocket!

5155
04:04:29,640 --> 04:04:29,640
Rocket!

5156
04:04:29,860 --> 04:04:29,860
Rocket!

5157
04:04:31,540 --> 04:04:31,720
Nice!

5158
04:04:32,000 --> 04:04:32,260
Nice!

5159
04:04:32,260 --> 04:04:32,920
Oh my god, nice.

5160
04:04:34,080 --> 04:04:34,600
Alright.

5161
04:04:36,480 --> 04:04:37,520
Oh shit.

5162
04:04:38,560 --> 04:04:39,420
Go to DP.

5163
04:04:39,440 --> 04:04:40,620
Go to DPS.

5164
04:04:40,640 --> 04:04:41,440
Oh, good job, guys.

5165
04:04:41,700 --> 04:04:42,120
He swaps.

5166
04:04:47,740 --> 04:04:49,560
Sorry about that, Rose, guys.

5167
04:04:49,780 --> 04:04:50,560
No, no, it's okay.

5168
04:04:50,840 --> 04:04:52,780
That's why it's like you have, when we say like...

5169
04:04:52,780 --> 04:04:53,540
They literally just countered your Rose.

5170
04:04:54,020 --> 04:04:54,040
Yeah.

5171
04:04:54,740 --> 04:04:57,960
He just had to like, uh, we just keep this comp.

5172
04:04:58,160 --> 04:04:58,860
Good job, head ass.

5173
04:04:59,680 --> 04:04:59,880
Okay.

5174
04:05:01,120 --> 04:05:04,200
Unless they start target batting, we could play other comps.

5175
04:05:04,460 --> 04:05:04,720
Yep.

5176
04:05:07,660 --> 04:05:08,840
Oh, she are.

5177
04:05:08,860 --> 04:05:09,440
That was awesome.

5178
04:05:09,580 --> 04:05:10,020
That was awesome.

5179
04:05:10,400 --> 04:05:10,840
That was awesome.

5180
04:05:10,840 --> 04:05:11,800
That was awesome.

5181
04:05:13,200 --> 04:05:21,140
okay so you see when i say like hi for res you just go like
not even close to us basically already yeah it's like you go

5182
04:05:21,140 --> 04:05:30,500
like uh uh you just like hide essentially like you make sure
that they can't find you yeah yeah you just have to be away

5183
04:05:30,500 --> 04:05:36,840
from the fight but not too far away but for if you res
before the portal you rest outside the portal and then you

5184
04:05:36,840 --> 04:05:43,040
go in okay okay that's how you do It's Convergence.

5185
04:05:43,220 --> 04:05:43,860
Oh, man.

5186
04:05:43,900 --> 04:05:45,260
Or Nephi Convoy.

5187
04:05:47,320 --> 04:05:48,100
She picks.

5188
04:05:48,800 --> 04:05:49,380
Her team picks.

5189
04:05:49,880 --> 04:05:53,280
It'd be kind of cool if they did use guard, or you just so.

5190
04:05:55,740 --> 04:05:57,580
My least favorite of these is Tokyo.

5191
04:05:57,800 --> 04:05:58,180
Oh, hello.

5192
04:05:58,420 --> 04:05:58,940
Where are we going?

5193
04:05:59,220 --> 04:06:00,780
We run 3-3.

5194
04:06:01,300 --> 04:06:02,820
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

5195
04:06:03,200 --> 04:06:04,580
Do you guys remember what the 3-3 is?

04:06:05,920 --> 04:06:08,580

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5205
04:06:51,150 --> 04:06:54,070
We'll do Hella then for the team to get rid of the team up.

5206
04:06:54,290 --> 04:06:55,210
We're doing Hella, right?

5207
04:06:55,810 --> 04:06:56,910
Like the soft counterate though.

5208
04:06:57,430 --> 04:06:58,270
Wait, wait, if he's...

5209
04:06:58,270 --> 04:06:58,850
Yeah, wait, hold on.

5210
04:06:58,930 --> 04:07:00,890
If he's playing Fantastic, we don't need to ban Hella.

5211
04:07:01,150 --> 04:07:02,170
If Fantastic is through.

5212
04:07:03,170 --> 04:07:03,330
Yeah.

5213
04:07:03,590 --> 04:07:03,990
What's...

5214
04:07:03,990 --> 04:07:05,650
Well, I don't think they're going to ban your Fantastic.

5215
04:07:05,910 --> 04:07:06,490
I'm going to be...

5216
04:07:06,490 --> 04:07:07,890
They didn't band Fantastic though.

5217
04:07:08,070 --> 04:07:08,290
Mm-hmm.

5218
04:07:08,950 --> 04:07:09,890
The band Namor instead.

5219
04:07:10,110 --> 04:07:10,510
I don't...

5220
04:07:10,510 --> 04:07:11,450
I don't want...

5221
04:07:11,450 --> 04:07:12,610
One of them got to go.

5222
04:07:12,610 --> 04:07:13,070
Hella?

5223
04:07:13,190 --> 04:07:13,410
Hella?

5224
04:07:14,090 --> 04:07:14,450
Hella?

5225
04:07:14,450 --> 04:07:14,810
Hella?

5226
04:07:15,090 --> 04:07:15,830
Hella or Storm?

5227
04:07:15,930 --> 04:07:16,510
We do Hella, right?

5228
04:07:17,610 --> 04:07:17,970
Hello?

5229
04:07:18,310 --> 04:07:18,350
Hello?

5230
04:07:18,990 --> 04:07:21,150
Okay, wait, is this a Jeff map?

5231
04:07:21,270 --> 04:07:22,830
Can that guy just wreck our shit again?

5232
04:07:23,210 --> 04:07:23,390
Yes.

5233
04:07:23,390 --> 04:07:23,970
Get rid of Storm.

5234
04:07:24,910 --> 04:07:25,590
Oh, Angie.

5235
04:07:26,770 --> 04:07:27,130
Two.

5236
04:07:27,770 --> 04:07:28,530
Um, yes.

5237
04:07:28,610 --> 04:07:29,110
50, 50.

5238
04:07:29,230 --> 04:07:30,150
Well, let's see which one is.

5239
04:07:30,490 --> 04:07:31,030
We'll do fine.

5240
04:07:31,170 --> 04:07:31,370
It's fine.

5241
04:07:31,670 --> 04:07:31,710
Pick Hella.

5242
04:07:31,710 --> 04:07:32,170
You pick Hella.

5243
04:07:32,310 --> 04:07:32,330
You pick!

5244
04:07:35,010 --> 04:07:36,110
Oh, Hawk.

5245
04:07:36,150 --> 04:07:36,690
Oh, okay.

5246
04:07:37,070 --> 04:07:38,290
They didn't ban my...

5247
04:07:38,290 --> 04:07:38,790
They didn't ban you.

5248
04:07:38,890 --> 04:07:39,690
So we can run her.

5249
04:07:41,450 --> 04:07:42,250
We run this.

5250
04:07:42,990 --> 04:07:43,310
Okay.

5251
04:07:43,790 --> 04:07:44,610
If they actually...

5252
04:07:45,210 --> 04:07:46,770
Lock him and make him sorry.

5253
04:07:46,970 --> 04:07:47,390
Come on, Heavenly.

5254
04:07:47,710 --> 04:07:48,450
Lock in and make him sorry.

5255
04:07:48,830 --> 04:07:50,090
Is it Loki or Adam?

5256
04:07:51,130 --> 04:07:51,750
If they run...

5257
04:07:51,750 --> 04:07:53,170
The thing is, we're attacking.

5258
04:07:53,310 --> 04:07:55,230
So the moment we see a Moon Knight, you can come back and
swap.

5259
04:07:56,050 --> 04:07:56,410
Okay, okay.

5260
04:07:56,730 --> 04:07:56,990
Yeah.

5261
04:08:00,390 --> 04:08:01,810
Tell him he's going to rue the day.

5262
04:08:02,570 --> 04:08:05,510
If we need to, you can go Invis and I can go Rocket.

5263
04:08:06,270 --> 04:08:06,430
Okay.

5264
04:08:15,580 --> 04:08:15,900
Alright.

5265
04:08:17,100 --> 04:08:17,780
Actually, here.

5266
04:08:17,900 --> 04:08:18,500
Yes, he attacks.

5267
04:08:18,600 --> 04:08:19,040
Oh, it's this.

Three, two, one.

5273
04:08:53,920 --> 04:08:54,720
Oh, let's see what they're doing.

5274
04:08:56,700 --> 04:08:58,080
I hear a Spider-Man.

5275
04:08:58,400 --> 04:08:59,320
Oh, no, that's the map.

5276
04:09:00,220 --> 04:09:02,520
Oh, your thing blocked it.

5277
04:09:05,500 --> 04:09:06,800
There is an Iron Man.

5278
04:09:06,920 --> 04:09:07,540
Iron Man.

5279
04:09:07,740 --> 04:09:07,940
Iron Man.

5280
04:09:08,480 --> 04:09:08,920
Iron Man.

5281
04:09:08,960 --> 04:09:09,340
Iron Man.

5282
04:09:09,580 --> 04:09:09,720
Iron Man.

5283
04:09:09,980 --> 04:09:11,420
Oh, he's so low.

5284
04:09:12,060 --> 04:09:13,900
That is so unlucky.

5285
04:09:14,200 --> 04:09:15,400
That guy was one HP.

5286
04:09:16,480 --> 04:09:18,600
I hit like, I just needed to hit a third shot.

5287
04:09:19,060 --> 04:09:19,560
Help our Emma!

5288
04:09:19,600 --> 04:09:20,320
Help our Emma!

5289
04:09:20,400 --> 04:09:20,740
Help our Emma!

5290
04:09:21,440 --> 04:09:21,940
I can't do anything.

5291
04:09:22,180 --> 04:09:22,640
Okay, nice.

5292
04:09:24,520 --> 04:09:27,200
Yeah, I just got kicked into the enemy team, but now
they're...

5293
04:09:27,200 --> 04:09:27,860
Now they're walled in.

5294
04:09:27,900 --> 04:09:28,840
I don't have Envon.

5295
04:09:29,500 --> 04:09:29,800
No, I'm good.

5296
04:09:32,100 --> 04:09:32,700
It's fine.

5297
04:09:32,700 --> 04:09:32,880
Oh.

5298
04:09:34,100 --> 04:09:34,700
We might...

5299
04:09:34,700 --> 04:09:35,040
I got Blur!

5300
04:09:36,320 --> 04:09:39,480
I think I'm gonna play Mag into this.

5301
04:09:39,780 --> 04:09:41,700
We can still triple tank, but I'm gonna play Mag.

04:20:51,200 --> 04:20:51,820
I have no bubble for you.

5663
04:20:51,860 --> 04:20:52,040
It's fine.

5664
04:20:52,960 --> 04:20:53,840
Just keep fighting out.

5665
04:20:53,900 --> 04:20:54,520
Keep fighting out.

5666
04:20:54,640 --> 04:20:54,940
Keep fighting out.

04:20:56,780 --> 04:20:57,100
All right.

5669
04:20:57,880 --> 04:20:58,240
They have a storm.

5670
04:20:58,320 --> 04:20:58,620
They have a storm.

5671
04:20:58,760 --> 04:20:59,220

And then we all meet up there and then wait, just wait, wait

5711
04:22:19,230 --> 04:22:19,670

We can make it.

5716
04:22:23,370 --> 04:22:27,450
I was so unlucky because Blur was just waiting for it.

5718
04:22:29,850 --> 04:22:31,170
Oh, there's a gap!

04:22:31,590 --> 04:22:31,970
There you are.

5720
04:22:31,970 --> 04:22:32,370
Are you ready?

5721
04:22:32,530 --> 04:22:33,110
There's no more, Jeff.

5722
04:22:33,270 --> 04:22:33,830
I'm switching the thing.

5723
04:22:33,950 --> 04:22:34,090
Okay.

04:22:34,830 --> 04:22:36,130

5725
04:22:36,130 --> 04:22:37,110
You can just go in.

5726
04:22:37,210 --> 04:22:37,610
You can just go in.

5727
04:22:37,650 --> 04:22:37,790
Yeah.

5728
04:22:38,450 --> 04:22:39,550

That's fine.

5732
04:22:46,210 --> 04:22:47,330
We have point.

5733
04:22:47,470 --> 04:22:47,770
We have point.

5734
04:22:49,050 --> 04:22:49,690
Get someone help.

5735
04:22:50,170 --> 04:22:51,030
Someone grab the healers.

5736
04:22:51,170 --> 04:22:51,810
I separated the healers.

5737
04:22:52,550 --> 04:22:53,110
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

5738
04:22:53,650 --> 04:22:53,870
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

04:22:53,870 --> 04:22:54,510
I have copy here.

5740
04:22:54,530 --> 04:22:55,230
The healers are still in the back.

5741
04:22:55,370 --> 04:22:56,110
The healers are still in the back.

5742
04:22:57,270 --> 04:22:58,070
They're still boxed in.

5743
04:22:58,230 --> 04:22:58,810
Yo, man, he was boxing.

5744
04:22:59,290 --> 04:23:01,350
We can get, we can get nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

5745
04:23:01,350 --> 04:23:02,370
Storm over here.

5746

5747
04:23:05,910 --> 04:23:07,090
Yeah, we're getting nice, nice, nice, nice.

04:23:07,170 --> 04:23:08,130
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

5749
04:23:09,810 --> 04:23:10,390
Care, care, care.

5750
04:23:10,910 --> 04:23:13,070
We don't have to, we can push, we can play here.

5751
04:23:13,070 --> 04:23:13,790
We can play here.

5752
04:23:13,790 --> 04:23:14,090
It's fine.

5753
04:23:14,090 --> 04:23:14,250
Okay.

5754
04:23:14,430 --> 04:23:15,010
I will see.

5755
04:23:15,030 --> 04:23:15,710
I will see.

5756
04:23:16,010 --> 04:23:16,230
Don't.

5757
04:23:16,310 --> 04:23:18,010
Don't save your all for last fight.

5758
04:23:18,190 --> 04:23:19,670
Save your all for last fight.

5759
04:23:20,010 --> 04:23:20,930
Bell, back up.

5760
04:23:21,130 --> 04:23:21,370
Back up.

5761
04:23:21,430 --> 04:23:21,530
You can.

5762
04:23:21,690 --> 04:23:21,910
Back up.

5763
04:23:22,130 --> 04:23:22,370
Back up.

5764
04:23:22,370 --> 04:23:26,390
This is like, we saved it for last fight.

5765
04:23:26,490 --> 04:23:29,770
What if the thing was blue?

5766
04:23:32,830 --> 04:23:33,750
Back up around the corner.

5767
04:23:33,910 --> 04:23:34,430
We're too far.

5768
04:23:34,510 --> 04:23:34,710
Okay.

5769
04:23:35,310 --> 04:23:35,610
Okay.

5770
04:23:35,770 --> 04:23:37,330
Yeah, ready to use the invisible.

5771
04:23:37,870 --> 04:23:40,130
When he lands that ult, I'm going to pull him away from the
point.

5772
04:23:40,730 --> 04:23:41,570
Oh, no, no, no.

5773
04:23:42,190 --> 04:23:42,510
No.

5774
04:23:43,430 --> 04:23:45,030
Oh, fucking mag ate it.

5775
04:23:45,230 --> 04:23:45,550
Damn it.

5776
04:23:45,730 --> 04:23:45,990
All right.

5777
04:23:46,090 --> 04:23:46,830
I'm blocking them off the point.

5778
04:23:47,070 --> 04:23:47,630
Oh, my God.

5779
04:23:48,130 --> 04:23:48,830
That's fine.

5780
04:23:49,770 --> 04:23:50,610
I'm dying.

5781
04:23:50,950 --> 04:23:51,670
They double healer ulted.

5782
04:23:51,790 --> 04:23:52,650
They double healer ulted.

5783
04:23:53,930 --> 04:23:54,250
I'm dead.

5784
04:23:55,410 --> 04:23:56,490
What the fuck is happening?

5785
04:23:57,550 --> 04:23:58,310
Oh, I don't know.

5786
04:23:58,550 --> 04:23:59,070
I can portal.

5787
04:23:59,230 --> 04:23:59,470
I can portal.

5788
04:23:59,890 --> 04:24:01,570
No, I got I got he.

5789
04:24:01,970 --> 04:24:02,430
Wait, I don't.

5790
04:24:02,530 --> 04:24:02,710
I can't.

5791
04:24:02,950 --> 04:24:03,230
Hold on.

5792
04:24:03,510 --> 04:24:04,750
No, no, no, no.

5793
04:24:05,050 --> 04:24:05,610
No, no, no.

5794
04:24:06,170 --> 04:24:06,490
I can't.

5795
04:24:06,550 --> 04:24:07,510
Swaps, swaps, swaps, swaps, swaps.

5796
04:24:07,870 --> 04:24:08,030
Swaps now.

5797
04:24:08,250 --> 04:24:08,450
Swaps now.

5798
04:24:08,590 --> 04:24:10,030
Swaps now.

5799
04:24:10,470 --> 04:24:10,570
Okay.

5800
04:24:10,970 --> 04:24:11,910
Or are you going mag?

5801
04:24:13,070 --> 04:24:13,810
I'm just saying Thing.

5802
04:24:14,230 --> 04:24:15,130
Thing is really good against them.

5803
04:24:15,170 --> 04:24:16,090
We still need Mag, though.

5804
04:24:16,550 --> 04:24:16,830
We're...

5805
04:24:16,830 --> 04:24:16,950
Oh, wait.

5806
04:24:16,950 --> 04:24:17,750
They don't have any Jeff.

5807
04:24:17,890 --> 04:24:18,430
They don't have any Jeff.

5808
04:24:18,470 --> 04:24:19,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5809
04:24:19,050 --> 04:24:20,410
I'm just dropping off.

5810
04:24:22,310 --> 04:24:22,870
It's faster.

5811
04:24:23,430 --> 04:24:23,810
Let's go.

5812
04:24:24,150 --> 04:24:24,430
Let's go.

5813
04:24:25,770 --> 04:24:26,870
Go toe to toe with him.

5814
04:24:27,010 --> 04:24:27,430
Get his ass.

5815
04:24:28,710 --> 04:24:29,430
We have to back up fully.

5816
04:24:29,430 --> 04:24:29,930
Back up fully.

5817
04:24:30,010 --> 04:24:30,470
Back up fully.

5818
04:24:30,790 --> 04:24:31,770
We don't need to feed them all.

5819
04:24:31,850 --> 04:24:32,330
Don't feed them all.

5820
04:24:32,450 --> 04:24:32,850
Don't feed them all.

5821
04:24:33,310 --> 04:24:33,650
We wait.

5822
04:24:33,750 --> 04:24:33,990
We wait.

5823
04:24:34,190 --> 04:24:38,790
I'll level round and then I'm going to ult them from behind.

5824
04:24:41,650 --> 04:24:41,930
Sorry.

5825
04:24:42,770 --> 04:24:43,050
All right.

5826
04:24:43,070 --> 04:24:43,490
Let's go.

5827
04:24:43,610 --> 04:24:43,930
Let's go.

5828
04:24:44,030 --> 04:24:44,790
We can...

5829
04:24:44,790 --> 04:24:45,930
He's not here yet.

5830
04:24:46,450 --> 04:24:46,750
Yeah, it's fine.

5831
04:24:46,850 --> 04:24:47,370
We can poke here.

5832
04:24:47,410 --> 04:24:48,530
We can poke because he's almost there.

5833
04:24:49,410 --> 04:24:50,410
I will copy and viz here.

5834
04:24:50,710 --> 04:24:52,830
You have to hide for this.

5835
04:24:53,010 --> 04:24:53,370
Okay.

5836
04:24:55,270 --> 04:24:55,990
Hiding, hiding.

5837
04:24:56,370 --> 04:24:59,050
Ooh, they tried to push me!

5838
04:24:59,670 --> 04:25:00,650
A second time!

5839
04:25:00,750 --> 04:25:01,190
I'm hiding.

5840
04:25:01,450 --> 04:25:01,730
I'm hiding.

5841
04:25:01,970 --> 04:25:02,430
Nice, nice.

5842
04:25:03,630 --> 04:25:04,870

It's a team game.

Congratulations.

6043
04:32:20,460 --> 04:32:21,000
Thank you.

6044
04:32:21,520 --> 04:32:21,940
Thank you.

6045
04:32:22,340 --> 04:32:22,940
Oh, I think...

6046
04:32:24,380 --> 04:32:25,420
I have to ask.

6047
04:32:25,980 --> 04:32:26,180
Yeah.

6048
04:32:27,700 --> 04:32:28,980
What do you do, baby?

6049
04:32:32,140 --> 04:32:35,580
So, obviously, that game was amazing, first of all, very fun
to watch.

6050
04:32:35,660 --> 04:32:37,760
The first game, it looked pretty tough.

6051
04:32:37,920 --> 04:32:42,700
What was the ultimate shift you guys did in the second game
to kind of change the tides?

6052
04:32:43,180 --> 04:32:43,740
Oh, it's easy.

6053
04:32:43,820 --> 04:32:44,400
You want to know what I did?

6054
04:32:44,620 --> 04:32:45,640
What did you do?

6055
04:32:45,840 --> 04:32:47,200
I turned my monitor on this time.

6056
04:32:48,660 --> 04:32:49,420
That's true.

6057
04:32:49,940 --> 04:32:55,760
I think like the other teams didn't know we actually had a
second DPS player that we put on tank.

6058
04:32:56,180 --> 04:33:01,200
So when they target banned our first DPS player, we're like,
all right, roll swap.

6059
04:33:01,680 --> 04:33:05,280
So then obviously Heavenly has an insane hot guy.

6060
04:33:05,840 --> 04:33:11,660
And so, but Lila was our, yeah, it was, I mean, he got
target banned after that.

6061
04:33:12,240 --> 04:33:12,540
Yeah.

6062
04:33:13,020 --> 04:33:13,700
He was too nasty.

6063
04:33:14,620 --> 04:33:15,700
but I'm still getting that W.

6064
04:33:15,840 --> 04:33:16,440
What was the point?

6065
04:33:17,880 --> 04:33:18,940
You should have been Groot.

6066
04:33:19,300 --> 04:33:20,840
I could have been Grooter in the building, baby.

6067
04:33:20,940 --> 04:33:21,800
What are you talking about?

6068
04:33:22,560 --> 04:33:26,420
And yes, and they obviously target banned our support
backline, too.

6069
04:33:26,620 --> 04:33:31,100
So we had to play an entirely new support comp that we
haven't really practiced with.

6070
04:33:31,460 --> 04:33:34,940
And Yuzu had to pick up how to play Adam for the last two
games.

6071
04:33:35,320 --> 04:33:38,680
So really insane that she was able to do that for us.

6072
04:33:39,920 --> 04:33:45,060
It was really cool to watch, especially the fights towards
the end there where it was like two people were dropped from

6073
04:33:45,060 --> 04:33:50,820
each team what what kind of comms are you giving to stand to
like in that situation or are you just shutting up and let

6074
04:33:50,820 --> 04:33:51,920
them do their thing kill

6075
04:33:56,140 --> 04:34:01,720
i guess like when we're down too we just yeah yeah we just
be like focus this week we have the odds to win this fight

6076
04:34:01,720 --> 04:34:07,400
like just just or like or just die on the card like we all
just die on the card stall the card as long as we can and

6077
04:34:07,400 --> 04:34:09,780
then you know we got some time out of it and we don't

6078
04:34:13,220 --> 04:34:18,920
teams had like a really strong player like at least one or
two but our team had really good comms and i think that's

6079
04:34:18,920 --> 04:34:24,120
like ultimately what helped us the most we just listened
when we were told what to do yeah yeah i thought we were

6080
04:34:24,120 --> 04:34:29,000
really like well rounded which is really nice i feel like we
could flex into anything or like most of us could flex into

6081
04:34:29,000 --> 04:34:34,880
any role that was required which is really helpful that i
think gave us like an advantage against the other ones you

6082
04:34:34,880 --> 04:34:40,180
guys played a lot of different characters and even doki
played loki at the end which we didn't see yeah we were like

6083
04:34:43,540 --> 04:34:47,820
Yeah, it's an actual strat, like the 3-3, like three tanks,
three supports.

6084
04:34:48,240 --> 04:34:50,900
So I fucked up how you're supposed to play Loki.

6085
04:34:51,160 --> 04:34:56,960
You're supposed to like copy the atom and then do like, like
basically do like a never-ending res fight.

6086
04:34:57,380 --> 04:35:00,480
But then the moment I copied, like the storm was like right
next to me.

6087
04:35:00,560 --> 04:35:01,480
And I was like, oh, okay.

6088
04:35:02,380 --> 04:35:04,460
I guess no alts for anyone.

6089
04:35:05,800 --> 04:35:08,560
But yeah, no, it's, we are all so well-rounded.

6090
04:35:08,760 --> 04:35:12,560
Like no one can really target ban us because all of us were
not really one tricks.

6091
04:35:12,560 --> 04:35:20,560
so we're able to like play other types of characters and
change your comps um so i'm really proud of my team for that

6092
04:35:20,560 --> 04:35:26,080
i noticed that you guys also didn't ban uh jeff in the other
games did you feel like jeff was a problem or you had it on

6093
04:35:26,080 --> 04:35:35,220
the control on that map he was a problem he was very
disruptive yeah it's so yeah and then we figure it out we're

6094
04:35:35,220 --> 04:35:42,960
just like just hold mag out for him like puked the fuck yeah
the magneto shield seemed to address a lot of those issues

6095
04:35:42,960 --> 04:35:50,100
but then storm also was very very frustrating it looked like
for you guys to deal with yeah yeah and i think blower in

6096
04:35:50,100 --> 04:35:58,660
general was just very hard to deal with he's just a good
player yeah yeah he's a very moments where the healing

6097
04:35:58,660 --> 04:36:06,000
battle just seemed like it never ended on both sides you
were just like come on just die triple support baby triple

6098
04:36:06,000 --> 04:36:13,260
support yeah it was kind of from the from like commentating
it's like oh he's gonna i know he's just full help well how

6099
04:36:13,260 --> 04:36:23,740

You guys put in the work.

6161
04:38:26,340 --> 04:38:27,540
Popping in the fuck off.

I was in my seat jumping.

6179
04:38:51,200 --> 04:38:52,980
I was watching Heavenly's POV.

6180
04:38:53,360 --> 04:38:56,340
There was a point where he dropped his own little own music.

6181
04:38:56,620 --> 04:38:59,100
He hockey ulted, locked in, and killed four people.

6182
04:38:59,300 --> 04:39:00,840
I was literally jumping in my seat.

6183
04:39:01,040 --> 04:39:02,860
I was literally jumping in my seat.

But you can choose a different person to raid.

the number.
