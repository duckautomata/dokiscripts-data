1
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,440
Hello, hello, hello, everybody.

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,120
Hello, guys.

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,320
Today, we're gonna finally finish Halo.

4
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,500
Finally.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,000
No bait this time, no bait.

6
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,860
Because I feel a lot more refreshed and I can actually do a long, enjoying stream today.

7
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:50,180
If, um, um, if, uh, oh, wait, it's not the thumbnail.

8
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,640
Oh, wait, whoops, wrong outfit.

9
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,600
Okay, do you want me to be in the swimsuit or the school outfit?

10
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,160
Guys, I'll let you guys pick.

11
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,780
Because we're gonna be seeing me for a while.

12
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,960
How about, like, halfway through, we'll swap, okay?

13
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,440
Halfway through, I'll just go back into my closet and change clothes.

14
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,380
Like...

15
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,920
Because it's gonna be, I don't know how, how many hours we have left.

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,600
It really depends on, like, um, how long I can stay alive.

17
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,860
Um, how many times I can get fucked up by, uh, the flood.

18
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,580
Uh, so, I don't know.

19
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,640
Maybe halfway through.

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,980
We'll, we'll swap outfits halfway through, guys.

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,540
How about that?

22
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,340
Um, um, but yes, today we're gonna be trying, we're gonna finish Halo.

23
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,160
Um, I have no idea.

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,600
Um, how many hours I technically have left in this game.

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:53,120
Um, but, for those who are wondering, if I'm gonna go straight to Halo 2 right after, um, I am, I'm gonna, like, take a little buffer in between to do a new game series.

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,820
Um, to, like, you know, I like to do a buffer in between so we don't do, like, back-to-back-to-back when it comes to, like, uh, series.

27
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,900
Uh, so, I'm not sure what game I'm gonna try next week.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,480
Okay, let me see.

29
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,680
There is a game I really wanna try, but I'm gonna double-check.

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
Uh, how long, how long to beat this game?

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,720
Uh, let me double-check.

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,340
Okay, I might start Epic Mickey next week because Epic Mickey is a game I've always wanted to play for the longest time.

33
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:39,320
So, we're going from Halo, uh, the, haha, the most bro, uh, game, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha,

34
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,900
haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha,

35
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,940
haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha I am not a Disney adult.

36
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:57,600
I am not a Disney adult because I have never been... I've never like... I don't know.

37
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,940
I don't see myself as a Disney adult because I'm really obsessed.

38
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:13,260
Okay, how I categorize Disney adults are those that actually spend an exuberant amount of money to visit Disney World slash Disneyland every single day.

39
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,740
Oh, to be fair, the only thing that's preventing me is because I live in Canada.

40
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,640
Like, there's no Disneyland in Canada.

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,300
I don't know why.

42
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,100
But, but, because, not because I'm Canadian that I don't do that.

43
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,300
But one of the things I see Disney adults love to do is pin collecting.

44
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,800
And like, I don't know.

45
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,740
I'm not a... I don't know.

46
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,800
I don't understand the minds of like the pin collectors where they would like actually...

47
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,420
There's like, like, there's whole fucking society when it comes to like pin collecting.

48
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,780
And, um, yeah, those are on another level.

49
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,840
Um, and they would like, every day they'll go to these boards to like trade pins.

50
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:09,280
And then like staff members have like trivias, trivia questions that they give the pin collectors where they can trade for like secret trivia pins.

51
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,980
And then, currently, they're doing a thing for the Disney...

52
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,600
What is it?

53
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,700
50th anniversary...

54
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,320
Is it 50th anniversary or 100th?

55
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,840
I don't remember.

56
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,520
Uh, like the new anniversary thing at Disneyland where they're doing a thing about the key thing.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,940
Like where, uh, they have...

58
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,520
Yeah, it's a cult.

59
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,700
No, I 100% agree.

60
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:45,660
Like, um, 100th anniversary where they get a key and they have to visit every land in Disneyland or like every like sector in Disneyland to like, like, um, to like unlock their key, like a key blade.

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,900
And then each key has a unique pin you have to collect out of like eight pins.

62
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,300
And then the key itself costs like 50 plus dollars.

63
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,760
So it's like, what, you just buy 50...

64
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,540
Like, you want to buy eight keys and test your luck?

65
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,760
Like...

66
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,560
Because if you're collecting...

67
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,460
If you're collecting all those pins, the only way to get it is to like have the key.

68
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,600
Or like, I guess you could like buy it off, trade it with other collectors.

69
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,180
But I feel like the other collectors would also want to complete their collection.

70
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,640
So the only way to actually complete your collection is to buy like eight more keys.

71
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,940
And then that's like what?

72
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,520
You have to buy eight more keys that are like 50 plus dollars each, not including tax.

73
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,080
And then I guess like trade your remaining pins to like get the full set.

74
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,320
Like, that's crazy.

75
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,960
Oh my god.

76
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,740
Um, that's so much work.

77
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,700
There's a channel that some...

78
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,040
There's a channel that sometimes pops up on my YouTube algorithm for shorts.

79
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,820
Where all they do every day...

80
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,380
They're like a married...

81
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,800
They're like a married couple.

82
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,900
And their entire channel is dedicated to like trading pins every day.

83
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,260
And like their whole goal is like...

84
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,740
Today we're gonna find...

85
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,080
Um...

86
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,880
We're gonna make...

87
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,760
It's a competition between husband and wife.

88
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,720
So like today we're gonna see who can collect the most pins based off of like Disney shoes or something like that.

89
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,420
Or like we're gonna see who has the pin that has the most numbers on their pin.

90
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,500
And it's like every day is a fucking challenge.

91
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,640
And they do this like...

92
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,560
They upload these shorts every fucking day.

93
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,740
So they must go to Disneyland almost every...

94
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,280
Because I...

95
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,980
I don't know.

96
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,420
They...

97
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know.

98
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,800
They have different clothes every time.

99
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,820
Like so I don't know if they like change their clothes in between.

100
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,460
So that like...

101
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,680
In between these shorts.

102
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,220
So it makes it seem like they're there on different days.

103
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,200
Or like they film it in bulk.

104
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,240
Because I don't understand like every...

105
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,780
Because I'm like...

106
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,720
Do they just like...

107
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,200
Because I'm like...

108
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,620
Do they go to Disneyland every day?

109
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,460
Like...

110
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,840
Like...

111
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,400
To do this challenge.

112
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,440
And like...

113
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,020
Whoever...

114
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,300
Whoever wins...

115
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,600
Um...

116
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,300
Gets to pick the lunch for today.

117
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,600
And I'm just like...

118
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,160
Do you just...

119
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,820
Go to Disneyland every day?

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,240
To...

121
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,400
To collect pins?

122
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm like...

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,480
Holy fuck.

124
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,360
I was like...

125
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,660
Yeah.

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,220
I was like...

127
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,640
Jesus.

128
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:18,940
Okay.

129
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
But like...

130
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,800
The shorts kept popping up.

131
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,180
And it...

132
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,500
I don't know.

133
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,300
It's so addicting.

134
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,240
Because it's like...

135
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,740
It's like...

136
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,220
Who's gonna win this time?

137
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,720
But...

138
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,020
Who's gonna win this...

139
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,200
Pin collection challenge this time?

140
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,560
And it's so addicting to watch.

141
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,160
I couldn't...

142
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,760
Because like...

143
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:35,960
You know...

144
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,480
I just live by cutesy through them.

145
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:37,720
I...

146
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:37,920
I...

147
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,360
I've obviously won't do that.

148
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,060
But it's like...

149
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,300
Damn.

150
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,640
That's what life is like over there.

151
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,240
For...

152
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,780
You're...

153
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,340
Yeah.

154
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,520
I'm endabling it.

155
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:47,840
Like...

156
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:47,900
Yeah.

157
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,960
I'm encouraging it.

158
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,340
Like...

159
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:49,800
Because like...

160
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,140
You know...

161
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,320
I wouldn't do it.

162
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,560
But I don't mind seeing them do it.

163
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,100
Like...

164
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,060
It's like...

165
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,600
You know...

166
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,320
You're like...

167
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,380
Um...

168
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,960
You're like...

169
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,160
You know...

170
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,880
You're at a zoo.

171
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,040
And you know...

172
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,480
You're...

173
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,420
You buy a ticket to the zoo.

174
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,320
So that...

175
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,580
You know...

176
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:10,820
But the ticket sales on that will help the zoo, like, make sure the animals can continue to live their lives.

177
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,540
That's me.

178
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:19,640
I'm buying a ticket right now to see these Disney adults continue to live their lives so I can be entertained.

179
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,280
So they can continue to do their thing.

180
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,060
I'll be like, oh, that's interesting.

181
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,940
We have to protect their habitat.

182
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,880
Exactly.

183
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,360
We have to protect their lifestyle, guys.

184
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,280
How else will I be entertained, chat?

185
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,400
This is so dystopian.

186
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,080
What the fuck, Doki?

187
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,040
How else would I be entertained, chat?

188
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,900
Like, I'm not gonna do it, but I'm okay with watching someone else do it.

189
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,900
But yeah, most likely next week we're gonna do...

190
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,320
We're gonna do an Epic Mickey because it seems like it's like...

191
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,820
Okay, it says, like, it takes, like, 13 hours to do.

192
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,340
Also, by the way, um, thank you everyone for replying to, like, what are some of the games you've grown up with?

193
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,640
Because I'm actually using that to figure out what to play, like, like, games to play in the future.

194
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:36,020
Because, like I said, I didn't grow up with a lot of, um, uh, typically normal childhood games.

195
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,320
Because I just played my dad's hand-me-downs.

196
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,660
Um, so there's a lot of games that I didn't really, like, have a chance to play.

197
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,040
So that's why I was, like, using that as, like, and then it went, it went viral.

198
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:57,080
I didn't, I didn't expect the tweet to get, like, how many, it got, like, um, it got out of, like, my general audience.

199
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,420
Uh, because I got, like, 3 point, not viral, but, like, it got, like, 3.4k replies.

200
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,700
I mean, yay.

201
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,100
I'll boost my own Twitter algorithm unintentionally.

202
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:15,380
I, I, yeah, it left my circle because I had, like, random people replying.

203
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,140
Um, so, like, I got a lot of suggestions, though.

204
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,080
So, that's good.

205
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,860
So, I can, you know, use that for future when I, like, figure out what games to play next.

206
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,440
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

207
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,060
Thank you, thank you.

208
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,600
Oh, my God.

209
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,500
Yay, engagement bait.

210
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,420
Unintentional engagement bait.

211
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,420
It's, like, those people that make tweets, like, um, name, I bet you can't.

212
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,260
Name a VTuber whose name doesn't have, like, E in it.

213
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,840
And then I, like, you know, I ego search myself and do, like, uh, Doki, oh, wait.

214
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,740
Doki Bird.

215
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,920
It's, like, that's easy, dude.

216
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,060
And I would see that.

217
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,100
But, like, that is clear, like, engagement baiting.

218
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,480
Like, oh, I think the amount of times I see, like, people making, like, those fucking tweets.

219
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:07,380
It's being, like, um, I bet you can't name a VTuber, uh, whose, uh, name, like, name doesn't have A in it.

220
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,460
Like, shit, like, it's so blatant, too.

221
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
Um, um, uh, someone has played both of the following games.

222
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,540
You're not necessarily a Disney adult.

223
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,460
You play Epic Mickey.

224
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,420
You're absolutely a Disney adult.

225
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,740
And you can't shut up about Kingdom Hearts.

226
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,700
Thank you for the super chat.

227
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,020
Thank you.

228
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,660
Thank you.

229
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,260
Cool.

230
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,240
Thank you for the super chat.

231
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,620
Thank you.

232
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,340
Thank you.

233
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,620
Uh, this is just like when I super in order to let Doki continue her DoorDash lifestyle.

234
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,760
It's, like, oh, my God.

235
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,040
That reminds me, like, the Uma Musume tweet that I saw.

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,160
Where, like, you know, you can, like, donate, like, you can donate $5 to send Haru, like, what's her name?

237
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,780
Haru?

238
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,940
Some grass.

239
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:56,160
And basically, sending me a super chat provides me food.

240
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:56,800
Yeah.

241
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,940
Yeah.

242
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,020
Oh, yeah.

243
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,580
It's, like, you know, it's just like that.

244
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:09,360
Uh, if you super chat me, I can, I can also get DoorDash.

245
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,860
Uh, Mr. BrokenPod, thank you for the super chat.

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,300
Thank you.

247
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,940
Thank you.

248
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,660
Got it.

249
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,240
You just like to watch others do something fun together.

250
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,220
Freak.

251
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,640
Thank you for the super chat.

252
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,000
Thank you.

253
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,640
Thank you.

254
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,400
Wings.

255
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,580
Thank you for the super chat.

256
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:23,940
Thank you.

257
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,600
Thank you.

258
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,200
Super to support my psychotic people watching like Doki does.

259
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,900
Except for me, it's me, too.

260
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,320
Thank you for the super chat.

261
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,660
Thank you.

262
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,240
Thank you.

263
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,160
Mistakes.

264
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,220
Thank you for the super chat.

265
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,520
Thank you.

266
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,000
Thank you.

267
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,380
Can you believe people waste money on Disney twins?

268
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,020
Giving money to YouTubers hoping they'll notice your Supa and say your name is a better use of money.

269
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,300
Thank you for the super chat.

270
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,420
Thank you, thank you.

271
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,200
Next thing, thank you for the super chat.

272
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you, thank you.

273
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,200
With our support, Doki will not go hungry.

274
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:59,100
Alright, I was debating if I should get... if I should uber slash skip the dish food tonight.

275
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,420
Because I was like, I've been cooking the last two days.

276
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,100
So, I can be lazy today.

277
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:19,660
Because my visitors today, sent me my droite My visitors today made sure that I could eat tonight And same name!

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,240
Thank you to the super chat!

279
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,600
Thank you, thank you.

280
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,580
5$ to enable Doki's unhealthy habits.

281
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,480
Sign me up.

282
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,340
Thank you for the super chat!

283
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,380
Thank you, thank you!

284
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,420
Supra, thank you for the super chat!

285
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:31,800
Thank you.

286
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,380
Thank you.

287
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,340
Same hay, some hay for Toki.

288
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,360
Is this how it works?

289
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,320
Thank you, Super Chat.

290
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,160
Thank you, thank you.

291
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,820
Oh, yeah.

292
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,840
And, like, I've been, like, thinking about, like, because I've been wanting to eat more, like, healthier lately.

293
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,720
Because, like, you know, I haven't been eating healthy the last month and a half because I've been so fucking stressed out.

294
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,660
So, you know, I've been, like, you know, I've been, like, I just want comfort food after, like, long days of work and stuff.

295
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,800
So I haven't been eating healthy the last month and a half because I've just been, like, you know, mostly ordering food.

296
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,780
I don't want to go outside.

297
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:14,540
Recently, I've been looking at pre-cooked meals.

298
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:25,980
You know those places that deliver food to you, but they're pre-cooked meals by chefs that are meant to have different meal plans, basically.

299
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,880
It's not like you're ordering from a restaurant, but they're more healthier because it's like

300
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,140
they're more so like they have a calorie.

301
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,240
Oh, this is if you're looking for this to this amount of calories.

302
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
And then they give you the menu and everything of what they're cooking.

303
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,740
And then if they deliver you on the day, they make it, too.

304
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:58,660
So I was looking into that because I saw a few of my friends have been ordering them, too.

305
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,680
And they said like, oh, it's like pretty good and it's actually pretty healthy.

306
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,520
And I saw one of the menus where I'm ordering the one in my city.

307
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,740
So it's not like they're not like actual like... No, it's not HelloFresh.

308
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,240
HelloFresh, you have to cook it yourself.

309
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:20,180
So I don't want to cook it myself right now because I just want to because I know like next month I might be like super busy.

310
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:28,300
So I'm ordering one where I'm ordering from a place where it's from my city.

311
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:35,220
And they're gonna... They're gonna like send me like... It's gonna start next week.

312
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,340
Uh...

313
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,320
They're gonna start... It's gonna start next week.

314
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,660
I'm gonna try it out.

315
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,620
I'm gonna see how I feel about it.

316
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,960
And I saw the menu.

317
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,200
It looks really, really good.

318
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,020
I wish I could show you the pictures, but I can't because it's literally just for my city.

319
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,880
So it's just for my city.

320
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,580
So I was like... So if I show you the pictures, it's more doxable.

321
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,340
London is my city.

322
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,800
Um...

323
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,520
And...

324
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,620
And anyway, so...

325
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,580
Um...

326
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,820
What was I gonna say?

327
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,200
Fuck.

328
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,600
There's something else I was gonna say.

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, someone's like... Isn't it expensive?

330
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,760
I actually calculated it.

331
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,600
It's cheaper than ordering on... on like...

332
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,340
Like Uber or like DoorDash or... or Skip the Dishes.

333
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,000
It's cheaper.

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,880
Because the meals are healthier.

335
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,940
And, um...

336
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,140
And they're like...

337
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,020
Um...

338
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,580
And...

339
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,640
They cost less.

340
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,600
And shipping is free.

341
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,100
Because I ordered like...

342
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,240
A week and a half of worth of...

343
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,740
A week and a half...

344
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,100
Actually, no.

345
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,620
Is it a week?

346
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,140
Or...

347
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
I think it is.

348
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,200
A week's worth of...

349
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,660
Uh...

350
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,060
The meals to test it out.

351
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,280
Because you can only order like a week...

352
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,020
Um...

353
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,400
Minimum.

354
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,860
So I'm ordering like a week minimum just to test it out.

355
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,720
Uh...

356
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,980
But it is cheaper than me ordering out...

357
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,600
From...

358
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,220
Um...

359
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,000
From like Uber Eats and stuff all the time.

360
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,140
Um...

361
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,720
And then...

362
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,440
There were two...

363
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,200
There was another one that I almost ordered.

364
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,180
Because I was like...

365
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,980
Oh, this seems healthy.

366
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,500
And I looked at the...

367
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,040
FAQ.

368
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,500
And they're like...

369
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:09,980
Typically...

370
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,720
We serve senior citizens.

371
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,200
But...

372
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,640
We also...

373
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,160
Um...

374
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,080
We're also very...

375
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,600
We try...

376
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,880
We try to up a variety and...

377
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,160
Uh...

378
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,700
And...

379
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,500
And like...

380
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:22,940
It's not...

381
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,200
It's not just usually...

382
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,000
We can also serve people from all ages.

383
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,080
And I was like...

384
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,300
Okay.

385
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,380
I shouldn't get that one.

386
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:29,860
I...

387
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,920
At first...

388
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,120
I was sent to order this one.

389
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,800
Because it was closer to me too.

390
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,220
It was closer to me.

391
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,200
And they're like...

392
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,760
Well, typically...

393
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,240
We try to make these meals for senior citizens.

394
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,160
Who might need it.

395
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,880
Because...

396
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,240
Um...

397
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,220
They can't really move around as much anymore.

398
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,440
I was like...

399
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,900
Oh...

400
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,140
The food looks so good.

401
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,400
I was looking at the picture.

402
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:54,720
I was like...

403
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh...

404
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,100
This looks really good.

405
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,300
Let me look at the...

406
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,380
I almost earned it.

407
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,040
Because...

408
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,000
But then I read the FBQ.

409
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,780
And I was like...

410
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,140
Oh...

411
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,160
Man...

412
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,700
Maybe not.

413
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,000
I was just like...

414
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,420
Oh...

415
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,280
This is awkward.

416
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,240
Maybe...

417
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,700
Maybe...

418
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:12,820
Maybe...

419
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,080
Maybe...

420
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,140
Like...

421
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,700
I know I just had my birthday.

422
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,500
But like...

423
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,000
I still got some...

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,140
I still got some life in me.

425
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,760
But I went with a different one.

426
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,020
That was also...

427
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,760
Was not geared towards senior citizens.

428
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,680
Um...

429
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,980
I still have some gas left in this tank.

430
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,340
Yeah.

431
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,500
I haven't...

432
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,340
I haven't been like...

433
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,260
Lightning McQueen in...

434
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,720
What was it?

435
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,620
In the third movie.

436
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,020
Oh god.

437
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,860
That fucking...

438
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,480
I remember that...

439
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,760
That...

440
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,680
When the trailer...

441
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,980
For Cars...

442
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,880
Was it Cars 3?

443
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,540
Came out with a poster.

444
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,800
That shit went hard.

445
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,840
Everyone was like...

446
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
Holy fuck.

447
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,120
Was it Cars 3?

448
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,260
Where it looked like he was gonna fucking die?

449
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,320
Like...

450
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,440
It did.

451
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,340
Bro...

452
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,900
Guys...

453
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,560
I'm not...

454
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,400
I'm still...

455
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,640
I'm still Cars 1.

456
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,580
Lightning McQueen.

457
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,240
Guys...

458
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,820
Ka-chow.

459
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,580
I...

460
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,560
Yeah...

461
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:10,720
Like...

462
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,460
He was gonna fucking die...

463
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,420
In the trailer.

464
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,380
Like...

465
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,060
The poster went so fucking hard...

466
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,120
For no reason too.

467
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,900
I was like...

468
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,860
Holy shit.

469
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,740
Like...

470
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,220
Yeah...

471
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,540
Okay...

472
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,620
This is actually...

473
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,500
This is...

474
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,700
Okay...

475
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,900
For those who've never seen...

476
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,860
The Cars 3 poster...

477
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,020
That like...

478
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,320
Um...

479
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,720
That...

480
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,420
That first came out...

481
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,440
To tease...

482
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,820
Cars 3...

483
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,780
Here it is...

484
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,920
That shit looked...

485
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,540
It was like...

486
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,540
Holy shit...

487
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,580
Do they kill off Lightning McQueen?

488
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,540
Like...

489
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,140
This is literally...

490
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,120
The...

491
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,800
Teaser drop...

492
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,120
For...

493
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,980
Cars 3...

494
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,580
Like...

495
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,440
That was the first teaser drop for it.

496
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,380
It goes so fucking hard.

497
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,600
Everyone thought like...

498
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,220
They were gonna kill off Lightning McQueen.

499
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,460
Like...

500
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,740
He's...

501
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,360
Yeah...

502
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,380
And then like...

503
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,340
Um...

504
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,820
And then the...

505
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,400
And then the first teaser trailer...

506
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,500
For the movie...

507
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,460
The movie as well...

508
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,800
Was also fucking insane.

509
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,500
Like...

510
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:09,740
Yeah...

511
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,320
The trailer started with him fucking crashing his car.

512
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,120
It was like...

513
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,740
Jesus...

514
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,780
He's...

515
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,080
Dead.

516
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,060
Imagine you're a kid...

517
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,080
And you saw this...

518
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,680
And you're like...

519
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,840
Lightning McQueen?

520
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,240
He...

521
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,740
Ka-chow...

522
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,140
He cursed his last chow.

523
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,180
Oh...

524
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,860
That's not...

525
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,020
I'm not Cars 3...

526
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,800
McQueen yet.

527
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,560
Guys...

528
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,180
I best carve Cars 2!

529
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,220
I'm...

530
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,580
Uh,

531
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,400
thank you for the super chat...

532
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,160
Thank you, thank you.

533
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,540
I hope you saw some of my lists...

534
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,440
Before I got down...

535
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,540
Drowned out by everybody else.

536
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,140
If you were to play some N64 games from my childhood, it would make my day.

537
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,900
Thank you for the super chat.

538
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,300

Thank you.

544
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,300
Here's some grass for you.

545
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,120
Thank you.

546
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,800
Om nom nom.

547
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,300

551
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,540
Meep.

552
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,140
Alright, I'll make sure to do a super chat reading at the end of the stream, guys.

553
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,420
Because we gotta start this game because it's gonna be a long stream.

554
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,060
Ayako, thank you for the super chat.

555
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,340
Thank you.

556
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:18,800
Thank you.

557
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:27,800
That trailer for Cars 3 was so cinematic and dark, I still couldn't believe that was the same studio who made the previous one, and the same studio that made planes, guys.

558
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,540
Remember when they tried to be like, let's create a cinematic universe within Cars, and then they made fucking planes?

559
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:41,560
And... They tried to make a fucking cinematic universe.

560
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,120
Yeah.

561
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,200
Yeah.

562
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,920
Thank you for the super chat.

563
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,380
Thank you.

564
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,060
Thank you.

565
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,200
Alright, let's see.

566
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,720
Planes was actually from Disney, not from Pixar.

567
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,820
And yeah, do you know who owns Pixar?

568
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,840
You guys know?

569
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,900
Guys, that's like seeing, like, guys, like, you guys are like, yeah, Pixar and Disney, two very different studios.

570
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm pretty sure Pixar staff had it's had working on planes as well, guys.

571
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,960
I'm pretty sure.

572
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,200
It's not the same team.

573
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,140
Oh, sure.

574
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,720
Sure, it's not.

575
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,920
Anyway, let's boot up.

576
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Let's boot up.

577
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,180

Halo.

690
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,380
Halo Missionary Zero will be at that day.

691
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,220
I'm gonna make sure every week there's a collab.

692
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,680
But I didn't want to do too many collabs.

693
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,940
Because I need to conserve my...

694
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,700
Collabs take a lot of my energy.

695
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,360
So I'm trying to conserve my energy when it comes to group settings.

696
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,340
So I'm making sure it's just one collab per week.

697
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,740
But yeah, I'm gonna do...

698
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,700
Next Friday, it's gonna be Peak with Mint, Snuffy, and Laimu.

699
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,380
And then the Friday after that is part two of the Zero.

700
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,240
The fucking fucked up game where we get like spawn camp.

701
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,680
So that's gonna be on the 25th.

702
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,720
Alright.

703
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,800
Wait, that's not...

704
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,420
We're not multiplayer.

705
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,480
I was like, wait a minute.

706
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,320
This doesn't look right.

707
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,580
Alright.

708
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,480
Black screen.

709
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,460
No, it's still here.

710
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,340
Slop Peak Sisters.

711
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,780
That crap.

712
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,640

713
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:34,980

714
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,640
Thank you.

715
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,440
Oh my god.

716
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:37,920
Where am I?

717
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,040
Alright.

718
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,140

719
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Okay.

720
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,080

721
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:47,680
Here?

722
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,060
Where I go?

723
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,520
Hello?

724
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,920
Is that not where I go?

725
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,320
Pretty sure.

726
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,260
Yeah, that's the door.

727
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,320
Oh, wait.

728
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,960
The panel.

729
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,640
Forgot.

730
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,060
Okay.

731
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,840
1 HP and...

732
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,120
Okay.

733
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,480
I might have like saved at the worst possible place.

734
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:21,000
And I remember you guys too were like, hey, uh, you should really, uh, you should...

735
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,120
Oh shit, thank god.

736
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,280
Wait, aren't they bad people now?

737
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,580
Oh shit, forgot they're bad people now too.

738
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh.

739
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,760
I was like, oh, thank god my heroes.

740
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,740
I was like, wait a minute.

741
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,860
Wait, they're all so bad.

742
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,780
I'm...

743
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,700
Okay.

744
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,620
Oh, this is bad.

745
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,100
This is bad.

746
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,520
This is actually very bad for me.

747
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,420
Oh shit.

748
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,960
This is very bad.

749
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,660
I literally am one hit.

750
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,780
Okay, this is not good.

751
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:47,720
Alright.

752
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,680
This is fine.

753
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,640
Does that go over here?

754
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,720
There you go.

755
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,240
Alright.

756
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,120
Alright.

757
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:58,900
Did that hit him?

758
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,470
Okay.

759
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,570
Okay.

760
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,590
Please tell me there...

761
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,990
Please tell me there's heals somewhere close by.

762
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,490
Please tell me there is heals somewhere.

763
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,830
Oh my god.

764
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,830
I just need heals like anywhere.

765
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,970
Okay, I like this gun more.

766
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,950
There you go.

767
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,910
Alright.

768
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,590
It's fine.

769
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,650
Everything is fine.

770
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,910
I have 35 bullets.

771
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,870
There's no heals yet.

772
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,230
There's no heals.

773
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,810
No heals.

774
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,790
Alright.

775
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,030
Oh.

776
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,470
Hello?

777
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,010
Hello everybody?

778
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,950
Am I...

779
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,750
I'm not safe.

780
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,750
I don't feel very safe right now.

781
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,790
I don't feel very safe right now.

782
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,150
Hello?

783
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,910
Oh, I don't...

784
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,590
Okay, it's good.

785
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,270
There's a checkpoint.

786
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:08,910
Oh my god.

787
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,610
That's my own shield.

788
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,390
Oh my god.

789
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,710
Oh my god.

790
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,930
That's my own shield.

791
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,670
Framed me.

792
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,430
Oh my god.

793
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,530
I do not feel safe.

794
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,190
That's fine.

795
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,250
That's fine.

796
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:38,970
That's fine.

797
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,950
We recharge.

798
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,350
Slow and steady.

799
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,010
Hello?

800
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,010
I know you're alive.

801
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,090
Like...

802
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,610
I...

803
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:50,710
I...

804
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,590
It's big like...

805
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,970
Oh, it...

806
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,410
Like, I'll...

807
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:52,890
She'll forget.

808
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:54,970
Don't worry.

809
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,070
She'll forget.

810
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:56,990
There we go.

811
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,730
I was like, what are you doing?

812
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,290
Like, I know you're still there.

813
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,150
Like, where the fuck?

814
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,890
Why are you hiding?

815
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,430
I haven't completed the crash site yet, but we need to buy some time.

816
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,630
He's also, he's like, she'll forget.

817
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,670
She'll forget.

818
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,130
Maybe, yeah, up the tower.

819
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,010
Oh, please tell me where the fuck is the helos.

820
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,890
Where is it?

821
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,730
Okay.

822
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,550
Oh, thank god.

823
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,270
I'm marking the location of the nearest pulse generator with a nav point.

824
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,610
We need to move in and neutralize the device.

825
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:47,530
Okay.

826
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,950
Wait, do I...

827
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,730
I don't know.

828
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,750
Do I keep the shotgun or do I get...

829
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,670
Oh, I don't know.

830
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,110
Oh, wait.

831
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,050
No, I should get that.

832
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:57,730
Okay.

833
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,490
This is good.

834
00:29:59,090 --> 00:29:59,530
Sniper...

835
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,990
Sniper pistol.

836
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,150
This is good.

837
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,150
God damn it, it's bulletproof.

838
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,150
God damn stupid bulletproof glass.

839
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,530
Keep the shotgun.

840
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,370
Oh, but like...

841
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,510
Guys...

842
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:16,750
But like, look.

843
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,710
I have a pistol.

844
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,590
I'll need...

845
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,110
Oh, it's too late.

846
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,450
I don't want to go back.

847
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,750
It's too late.

848
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,090
Oh, shit!

849
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,070
Wait, what hit me?

850
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,640
It's too late.

851
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,060
We've already made our choice.

852
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,340
What?

853
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,300
Okay, that's it.

854
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,780
Oh, it's four shots.

855
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,160
Okay.

856
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,380
Memento.

857
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,100
Thank you for the super shot.

858
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,080
Thank you, thank you.

859
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,400
Get ready to enjoy the backtrack portion of the game.

860
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,220
Thankfully, Halo 2 won't do this, but still has a library.

861
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,500
All right, guys.

862
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,940
I made my choice.

863
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,520
Oh my god, that's it.

864
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,240
Okay, I can't see your...

865
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,280
I can't see your face.

866
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,480
I can't see your face.

867
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,020
Let me press tap real quick.

868
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,480
Okay, we gotta go down.

869
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,500
Sorry, guys.

870
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,360
I had to...

871
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,480
I had to do it.

872
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,240
I couldn't see.

873
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,920
Hey, where do I go?

874
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,820
Oh, down here.

875
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,910
There we go.

876
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,110
We don't need a flashlight!

877
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:37,590
Actually...

878
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,510
Oh my god!

879
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,890
Okay, I hate that.

880
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,370
I hate when it...

881
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,030
Oh my god, and he gets like a free shot off of me because of it.

882
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,030
I hate when, like, they shoot me and I unscope.

883
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,070
That's my pet peeve.

884
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,870
Gotta make sure.

885
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,910
Oh my god, my sniper ammo.

886
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,890
I don't have a lot, please.

887
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,450
Okay, nice.

888
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,670
All right, I'm gonna throw that there.

889
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,450
Okay.

890
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,010
Okay, I'm gonna...

891
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,810
You're gonna do that?

892
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,750
Because I'm lazy?

893
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,130
All right.

894
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,810
Goddammit!

895
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,030
Wait.

896
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,030
I swear to god.

897
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:29,730
Ah!

898
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,670
Okay, I'll stop fucking around.

899
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:33,910
Okay.

900
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:34,970
Nevermind.

901
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,290
I thought it'd look cool.

902
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,810
I thought it would look cool!

903
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,310
Okay?

904
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,470
I legitimately thought it would look really cool if I hit it.

905
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,150
It was all about the risk.

906
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,960
Okay, fuck this.

907
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,060
There we go.

908
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,100
Oh, shit!

909
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,910
Fuck's up to me!

910
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,030
Like...

911
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,410
That's all I...

912
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:08,970
Okay, guys.

913
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,450
Maybe I should have got the shotgun, guys.

914
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,430
Guys, I might have made a mistake.

915
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:13,810
Oh, wait.

916
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,450
I'd live these, right?

917
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,290
Oh, shit, nice.

918
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,950
Oh, shit, nice.

919
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,880
Okay.

920
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,820
I live these.

921
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,640
Aha!

922
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,600
Told you.

923
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,680
I live these.

924
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,540
Oh my god, these guys are such bitches.

925
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,440
Are you serious?!

926
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
What hit me?!

927
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,060
I live these.

928
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,870
You're kidding me?!

929
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,620
That hit me, guys.

930
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,620
Gold!

931
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,960
He's gold!

932
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,160
Oh my god, he's gold!

933
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,520
Okay.

934
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,000
We got rid of him.

935
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,070
Okay, bye.

936
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,330
I feel safe.

937
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,550
I feel so safe down here.

938
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,910
Or up here.

939
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,520
What the fuck is shooting me?

940
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,080
Oh, it's up there.

941
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,720
Okay, that's nothing to worry about.

942
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,640
Okay, it's fine.

943
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,120
We're okay.

944
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,360
We still have bullets.

945
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,340
Okay, that should have been a headshot.

946
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,560
Come on!

947
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,380
That was such an easy headshot.

948
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,060
Oh, no.

949
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,740
Do I have enough?

950
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,660
Okay, I do have enough.

951
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,820
Okay, I was a little worried that I might not have enough for the fucking tank that may or may not be on the other side.

952
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,500
Is that the tank?

953
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,780
Okay, I hope that was the tank.

954
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,320
Because I want to grab that banshee.

955
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,680
Oh my god, that was the tank.

956
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,060
No!

957
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:29,740
Oh my god.

958
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,300
Okay, I'm alive.

959
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:30,980
I'm alive.

960
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm alive.

961
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,340
Okay, I don't want to get back up.

962
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,200
I don't know why I get back up.

963
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,300
Okay.

964
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,400
It's fine.

965
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,640
That shouldn't hit me.

966
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,880
Fucking whore.

967
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,560
Oh my god, he's using the banshee as a body block.

968
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,540
He knows I need that.

969
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,340
Okay, nice.

970
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,080
Okay, now I should be able to get on to that.

971
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:56,820
Right?

972
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,260
How do I fly?

973
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,800
Guys, how do I fly?

974
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,340
Guys!

975
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,500
Fly, how?

976
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,740
Guys!

977
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,720
Oh my god, I'm flying.

978
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh my god, I'm flying.

979
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,440
Oh my god, I'm a beautiful bird.

980
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,580
Oh my god, I'm doing it.

981
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,700
Yay!

982
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,300
I can fly!

983
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,900
Yay!

984
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,100
Okay, nice.

985
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,120
Can I bring it in?

986
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,500
Oh.

987
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,920
I mean, that was fun.

988
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,240
Let me in.

989
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,360
Let me in.

990
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,540
Wait, I want to be inside.

991
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,340
Are you serious?

992
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:49,820
Yes.

993
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,780
No!

994
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,740
They won't let me in.

995
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,280
They can't bring my banshee in.

996
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,320
There's like no flying allowed.

997
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,500
Professor Oak kneecapped me.

998
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,240
It's not a good time to fly.

999
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:14,860
Okay.

1000
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,520
I'm gonna go this way.

1001
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,820
Hello?

1002
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,380
Oh.

1003
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,940
Maybe there's just some secrets?

1004
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,360
Some heals?

1005
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,820
No heals?

1006
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,220
Okay.

1007
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,220
I did it.

1008
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,580
Oh, it's that easy.

1009
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,920
Objective accomplished.

1010
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,360
Yay!

1011
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,140
Oh shit!

1012
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,880
Oh shit!

1013
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,150
Oh no, I don't have...

1014
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,970
Oh no!

1015
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,730
Oh, I'm so fucked up.

1016
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,790
I'm so fucked up right now.

1017
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,210
Oh, the tech support is here.

1018
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,470
Better get up.

1019
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,990
Oh no, I don't have plasma weapons.

1020
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,030
Oh!

1021
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,230
Okay, I have this.

1022
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,880
That's fucking...

1023
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,780
What the fuck?

1024
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,420
He lives?

1025
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:33,930
Okay.

1026
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,790
Yeah, I know I can just leave, but they're all surrounding the exit.

1027
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,630
This is as fast as I can go, guys.

1028
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,390
Oh my god.

1029
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,110
Oh my god.

1030
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:47,870
It's poking me.

1031
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,270
My little pokes.

1032
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,590
Okay, we gotta swap guns.

1033
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,310
Hello?

1034
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,290
Okay.

1035
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,150
Where is it?

1036
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,290
Mark the target with the nav point when we get closer.

1037
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,730
Yeah, I need that.

1038
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,230
Where is it?

1039
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,910
Oh, it's over here.

1040
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:14,470
Okay.

1041
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:15,850
Hello.

1042
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,070
Flying over now.

1043
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:18,850
Is he dead?

1044
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,150
The

1045
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,420
second pulse dinner is located in the adjacent canyon.

1046
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:27,880
Alright.

1047
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,040
Well, now we know.

1048
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,600
Now.

1049
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:30,780
No.

1050
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,580
He was, in fact, not dead.

1051
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,600
He was...

1052
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,140
Okay, how the fuck was I supposed to know he can just kill me like that?

1053
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,040
Like, who killed me?

1054
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,740
Who was it?

1055
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,580
Who was it?

1056
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,560
Who was it?

1057
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,060
Oh my god, it was you.

1058
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
I see your shots.

1059
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,800
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

1060
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,920
The second pulse generator is located in the adjacent canyon.

1061
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,280
Move out and I'll mark the target with the nav point when we get closer.

1062
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,620
Oh my...

1063
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,620
How does he just kill me like that?

1064
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,980
How is he that good?

1065
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,790
Okay, I'm getting out.

1066
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,750
I'm getting out.

1067
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,750
I'm getting out.

1068
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,490
I don't trust.

1069
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,110
I don't trust anyone.

1070
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,150
I'm...

1071
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,230
The world's strongest.

1072
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,490
I'm getting out.

1073
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,910
I'm getting out of here.

1074
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,830
I'm not letting that happen again.

1075
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,770
Oh my god.

1076
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,390
Oh my god.

1077
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,140
Okay.

1078
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:53,920
Okay.

1079
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,660
We're okay this time.

1080
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,440
We're...

1081
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,680
We're okay.

1082
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,140
We're okay.

1083
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,200
Fooled me at once, shame on you.

1084
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,800
Head through that door.

1085
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,380
That's the way to the next canyon.

1086
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,440
Oh, I don't have enough pistol ammo anymore.

1087
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,940
Oh, I hear something over here.

1088
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,800
Alright.

1089
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,880
Anybody on my right?

1090
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,880
Just gotta be sure.

1091
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,300
I just want to be sure there's nothing on my left side.

1092
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:31,780
Actually.

1093
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,640
What

1094
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,690
the fuck?

1095
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,950
He take three headshots!

1096
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,310
Okay.

1097
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,210
Get out of here.

1098
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,150
Hello, little guys?

1099
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,810
Little guys!

1100
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,770
What am I doing?

1101
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,610
Why am I wasting my stupid ammo on these guys?

1102
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,490
I forgot about melee.

1103
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,510
Alright.

1104
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,730
Just gonna do that.

1105
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:10,950
Just in case.

1106
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,220
Okay, so what's the lore between like...

1107
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,520
Why do like...

1108
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,700
The little guys know English?

1109
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,660
And then these guys are just like...

1110
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,340
Rawr!

1111
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,860
How come he knows English?

1112
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,940
What's the lore?

1113
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,400
I thought they were like, lower level.

1114
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,860
Compared to the others.

1115
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,580
Little guys are just like...

1116
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,200
Warp, warp, warp.

1117
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,900
Because they're...

1118
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,400
Because they're...

1119
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,660
Okay, but why are the grunts more educated?

1120
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,920
Unless the...

1121
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,140
Unless the...

1122
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,760
Um...

1123
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,500
They translate...

1124
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,480
Oh, only the grunt language is translated.

1125
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,640
Oh!

1126
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,220
Alright.

1127
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,780
Yeah, I was gonna say...

1128
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,640
Are elites like...

1129
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,400
Extra racist?

1130
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,000
So they don't bother learning English?

1131
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,560
Because it's beneath them?

1132
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,580
And then in the grunt lore...

1133
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,380
Like grunts are like...

1134
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,960
English to them is like...

1135
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,800
You know...

1136
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,640
Um...

1137
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,500
Like at their level?

1138
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,380
Like...

1139
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,260
Like I was gonna say...

1140
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,120
Like cause they're grunts...

1141
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,380
They're like...

1142
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,760
Oh yeah, speak their language.

1143
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,040
Cause you're just their level.

1144
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,980
Like is that it?

1145
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,060
That would make sense.

1146
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah, I was gonna say...

1147
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,520
Are they...

1148
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,000
They're just like...

1149
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,320
Bro...

1150
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,960
Like I'm not your level.

1151
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,700
Oh no.

1152
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,600
Oh, the needler gun got me.

1153
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,720
Oh, that's bad.

1154
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,600
It's okay.

1155
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:37,550
It's okay.

1156
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,990
We're five.

1157
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,790
I had...

1158
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:41,690
I took too many needles.

1159
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,150
Too much acupuncture.

1160
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:44,750
It's not good.

1161
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:47,730
We're just gonna wait.

1162
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,290
They're real time.

1163
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,050
Google translator.

1164
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,210
Oh, and then so like...

1165
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,070
The elites don't bother.

1166
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:52,970
Because they're too good.

1167
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:54,950
They're too good for us.

1168
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:58,470
Uh...

1169
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,950
Neppers!

1170
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,170
Thank you again for this super chat.

1171
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,070
Thank you, thank you.

1172
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:01,350
What?

1173
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:03,570
What?

1174
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,290
Oh, does that not hit you?

1175
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:07,930
It's like...

1176
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:08,730
You'll come to me.

1177
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,030
Oh shit.

1178
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:10,610
Nevermind.

1179
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:12,710
Let me hear.

1180
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,090
Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.

1181
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:21,750
There you go.

1182
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,470
Oh, I thought he was gonna go right.

1183
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,350
I mean, that's smart.

1184
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:25,450
Alright.

1185
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,450
This was the longest, like...

1186
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:29,950
Chicken that we played.

1187
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,250
What word word?

1188
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:35,910
The fuck no, it's cold.

1189
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,770
Oh my god!

1190
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,050
Wait, is that the fly?!

1191
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,950
Oh my god!

1192
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,140
Oh my god!

1193
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,420
Oh my god!

1194
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:45,740
Okay.

1195
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,360
Did not expect him to come back.

1196
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,820
I did not expect him to come back.

1197
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,780
I...

1198
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,440
I felt so safe, but...

1199
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,680
What the fuck are they doing?!

1200
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,640
Why didn't they deal with the blind?!

1201
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,980
Oh my god.

1202
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,280
Okay, that's fine.

1203
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,390
Oh my god, I wish I had my shotgun.

1204
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,550
I wish I had my shotgun right now.

1205
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,250
Don't be good.

1206
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:24,950
Don't be good.

1207
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:25,350
The shotgun.

1208
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,250
That's right, peek me.

1209
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,530
Oh my god, they're crouching that fucker.

1210
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,270
They don't.

1211
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,830
Come on, I know your head level.

1212
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,110
Wait, what?

1213
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:38,930
Who's coming in?

1214
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,850
Okay, you guys get out of here.

1215
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:41,830
You're not part of this fight.

1216
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,430
Guys, you're not part of this fight!

1217
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:43,830
Leave!

1218
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:45,630
Leave this fight!

1219
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,870
This is between me and the elites!

1220
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,370
Oh my god!

1221
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,510
You're not part of this!

1222
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,590
Get out of here!

1223
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,230
Get out of here!

1224
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:57,370
Get out of here!

1225
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,310
I'm trying to...

1226
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:00,870
Oh my god.

1227
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,870
Okay, we got one of them.

1228
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:05,990
Okay.

1229
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,150
There we go.

1230
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,830
There we go.

1231
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,250
Now you can join in!

1232
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,010
Oh my god, there we go.

1233
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:16,710
Alright.

1234
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,110
What the fucking shit?

1235
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,830
That scared me.

1236
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:24,490
Okay.

1237
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:25,630
Okay, that's fine.

1238
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:28,650
That's fine.

1239
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,730
Oh my god, that's fine.

1240
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,420
Bro, fuck this.

1241
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,500
Get out of here.

1242
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,400
Get out of here!

1243
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,660
Get out of here!

1244
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,840
Get your ass out of here!

1245
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,140
You think you're part of...

1246
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,960
Bro, this guy thinks he's part of the team.

1247
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,300
Benza, thank you for the super chat.

1248
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:54,580
Thank you.

1249
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,100
Thank you.

1250
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:03,180
Old lore was that the grunts are super intelligent and will learn other language speech patterns because they were used to intercept human comms and crack it for the elites.

1251
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,880
Oh!

1252
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,240
I see.

1253
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,140
Okay, that makes sense.

1254
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,880
That's gonna say, why are they speaking English to me?

1255
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:10,800
Like...

1256
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,240
I figured, like, you know, they have better...

1257
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,020
Like, I was like, why...

1258
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,060
Why are they speaking English?

1259
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,520
Like, they're very accommodating, you know?

1260
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,940
You know, they don't have...

1261
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,000
Like, it's literally just me.

1262
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,040
But...

1263
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,620
They're still willing to speak English.

1264
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,620
Oh!

1265
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,700
Okay, maybe they'll fight each other.

1266
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,620
Oh, thank god.

1267
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,340
Okay, that's good.

1268
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,540
So accommodating, you know?

1269
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,540
That's so nice of them.

1270
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,540
It's literally...

1271
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,680
Oh my god.

1272
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,460
My lights flickered just then.

1273
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,340
I...

1274
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,520
I was like, why did my lights flicker?

1275
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,820
That was so scary.

1276
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,100
That was actually so scary.

1277
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,210
I don't know why my lights flickered.

1278
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:03,590
It's like a ghost.

1279
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,250
A ghost came in to haunt me.

1280
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:08,710
Yeah, I can use that.

1281
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,270
Alright.

1282
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,610
Yeah, I don't know if you guys noticed.

1283
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:15,510
I just looked up.

1284
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:22,010
Alright.

1285
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,290
Here I go.

1286
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:24,930
Hello?

1287
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:27,850
I'm outside now.

1288
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:28,790
Hello?

1289
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,510
Oh shit.

1290
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:35,370
Oh shit.

1291
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,310
That's a lot of shield damage.

1292
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,410
Oh my god.

1293
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:39,170
I don't know who they're shooting.

1294
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:41,750
Oh!

1295
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:42,510
What the fuck?

1296
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,890
I was like, where did these guys come from?

1297
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:46,570
Okay, I'm gonna...

1298
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,610
Actually, they're like, so far away from me.

1299
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:49,330
So I don't have to worry.

1300
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,150
Like, they're shooting them.

1301
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,070
So I don't have to worry.

1302
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:54,570
So that's good.

1303
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,650
I just have to shoot them.

1304
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,660
Like, they're shooting them anyway.

1305
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,180
Oh!

1306
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,080
What the fuck?

1307
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,100
I made it.

1308
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,140
What?

1309
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,640
What was that?

1310
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:16,960
Okay.

1311
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:18,820
Okay, nice.

1312
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,460
I was like, bro, what?

1313
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,900
I thought you were distracted.

1314
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,620
But they did kill the...

1315
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,200
Oh my god.

1316
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,400
Oh my god, they came over.

1317
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,960
Oh my god, they can jump.

1318
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,030
Okay, nice.

1319
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,170
I didn't think they would just jump over.

1320
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,830
What the fuck?

1321
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,210
They pretended to be dead!

1322
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:46,250
He's like...

1323
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,130
He's like, wait, why did you get in the way of my 1v1?

1324
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,850
Bro, this was a 1v1, bro!

1325
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,930
Bro, expect the 1v1!

1326
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,350
That's right, I'm here, third party.

1327
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:00,890
Alright, I think he's dead.

1328
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,150
Wait, what?

1329
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,230
I just wanna get rid of this guy first.

1330
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:09,790
Okay.

1331
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,190
Alright, nice.

1332
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:14,650
Alright.

1333
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,750
No third party.

1334
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,770
Alright, we can go forward now.

1335
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,090
Nice.

1336
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:26,650
Hello.

1337
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,550
Here's something on the other side.

1338
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,510
Wow, thank you, Super Chat.

1339
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:35,850
Thank you.

1340
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:36,510
Thank you.

1341
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,850
Hello, guys.

1342
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,310
Anyone here?

1343
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:41,950
Hello?

1344
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:42,430
Anyone?

1345
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,990
Oh, I see you.

1346
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,470
Oh, I see you.

1347
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,470
I see you, Flood.

1348
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,370
Oh, I see all of you.

1349
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:48,810
Wow!

1350
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:50,310
I see so many of you!

1351
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:50,990
Wow!

1352
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,510
Oh my god!

1353
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:54,590
Oh!

1354
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,210
Oh my god, it's okay.

1355
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,850
I acknowledge you.

1356
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:00,890
It's alright.

1357
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,650
You've been acknowledged!

1358
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,770
What the fuck?

1359
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:08,810
Okay.

1360
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:10,510
Hello, everyone.

1361
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:10,990
Again.

1362
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,230
Hello.

1363
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,790
Is everyone actually dead?

1364
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,630
Are you all dead dead?

1365
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:21,390
Okay.

1366
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,670
As long as they're all actually dead dead, it's fine.

1367
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,250
Oh my god, not these guys.

1368
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:31,550
Okay.

1369
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:35,830
I wanna make pop these fucking bubbles real fast.

1370
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,430
There we go.

1371
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,570
It's like a little pop... party popper.

1372
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:43,730
Okay.

1373
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:46,830
Get out of here.

1374
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:48,630
Get out of here.

1375
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,350
Get out of here!

1376
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,770
Get your ass out of here!

1377
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,710
Oh my god.

1378
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,950
Little... party poppers.

1379
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,650
Is there anything up here?

1380
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:04,850
Gotta be sure.

1381
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:06,990
If there's any loot up here.

1382
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,410
I hear them.

1383
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,090
They're like... they come up?

1384
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,490
To fucking try and kill me?

1385
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:16,730
Hello?

1386
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:17,790
Oh, there you are.

1387
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,130
It's like I heard them.

1388
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:20,830
Like, going...

1389
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:21,970
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

1390
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,060
Okay, I got...

1391
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,240
Alright, one of you is not actually dead.

1392
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,440
I fucking knew it.

1393
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,060
I fucking knew it.

1394
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:33,860
I...

1395
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,740
I knew one of you guys were not...

1396
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,160
Oh, hey!

1397
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:36,840
Hey there, John!

1398
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,860
I can tell...

1399
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,720
I can tell who's pretending to be a...

1400
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,120
Pretending to be dead.

1401
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,620
I knew you were pretending!

1402
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:56,580
Alright.

1403
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,200
He just stood there.

1404
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,280
Oh my god, he has his airpods!

1405
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:01,660
Ah!

1406
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,900
Oh my god, not again.

1407
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:08,840
Not again.

1408
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:09,920
Not again!

1409
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,340
Guys, I had my airpods on.

1410
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,260
I...

1411
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,740
I had my airpods on chat.

1412
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:22,820
Okay.

1413
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,620
I gotta make sure I always have to...

1414
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,780
Have like...

1415
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,320
Gotta swap the gun for the alien...

1416
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,040
The plasma guns.

1417
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,040
So I can always have ammo for it.

1418
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,530
I fucking knew you were...

1419
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:37,830
Pretending.

1420
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,230
Uh...

1421
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,890
I can like literally just melee them.

1422
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,110
They don't do enough.

1423
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:47,810
Boop!

1424
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:48,910
Boop!

1425
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,430
They're like little ants.

1426
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,090
Alright.

1427
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:55,830
Alright, you deserve that.

1428
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,510
You get special treatment.

1429
00:53:58,850 --> 00:53:59,310
Boop!

1430
00:53:59,310 --> 00:53:59,330
Boop!

1431
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:01,750
Yeah, I hear them.

1432
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,050
Oh, I hear them.

1433
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:04,890
They're little popcorn!

1434
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:05,350
Yeah!

1435
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:07,390
Oh?

1436
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,730
They sound like...

1437
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,190
Like the...

1438
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,990
The zerg sometimes.

1439
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:13,890
Doesn't it?

1440
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:14,270
Oh!

1441
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:16,010
That's a rocket launcher.

1442
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,290
But don't they sometimes sound like...

1443
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,210
Zerg monsters?

1444
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:22,550
Like...

1445
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:25,870
Like when I...

1446
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,450
When I click on the structures, you know?

1447
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:28,950
Oh my god.

1448
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:29,190
Why?

1449
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:30,010
Oh my god.

1450
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:30,390
They're all...

1451
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,730
They're all trying to get...

1452
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,070
That's right.

1453
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,890
Bulletproof blast, baby!

1454
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,630
Can't get me!

1455
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,790
Oh my god.

1456
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,090
Oh my god.

1457
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,890
They all wanna fucking kill me.

1458
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,270
Oh, I hear it.

1459
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,750
I'm pretty sure the zergs came first.

1460
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,670
Kill this guy real fast.

1461
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,090
Okay, I killed the majority of their...

1462
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:03,770
Their kind.

1463
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,700
Alright, so I have to go that way.

1464
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,920
But I wanna make sure there's nothing.

1465
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,480
Ba-bop.

1466
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,380
Ba-bop.

1467
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,200
Are they still...

1468
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:13,900
Oh my god.

1469
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,740
They're still there.

1470
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,480
Bro, get out.

1471
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,660
Are you guys still there?

1472
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,420
Get out!

1473
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Oh my god, it was...

1474
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,640
It was not bulletproof.

1475
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,400
Oh, thank god I didn't shoot it.

1476
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,040
I...

1477
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,860
It was not bulletproof.

1478
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,480
I couldn't...

1479
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,820
I almost shot it.

1480
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,920
I was so tempted.

1481
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,140
I almost shot at it.

1482
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,740
Oh my god.

1483
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:44,420
Oh my god.

1484
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,440
It was not bulletproof.

1485
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,980
Thank god I didn't test my theory.

1486
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,700
It would've been funny though.

1487
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,900
It would've been funny.

1488
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,660
I would've been funny.

1489
00:55:59,380 --> 00:55:59,820
Alright.

1490
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:03,880
Like...

1491
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,960
It would've been absolute karma.

1492
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,560
If I did try and shoot it.

1493
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:12,600
Okay.

1494
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,460
I'm just gonna get rid of the...

1495
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,020
Little...

1496
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:16,980
The flood guys.

1497
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:17,640
Instead.

1498
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,140
Are you s- I'm helping you!

1499
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,320
I'm fucking helping you!

1500
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:31,760
Oh my god.

1501
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,300
And you shoot me?!

1502
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,140
Oh my god.

1503
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,580
I'm fucking helping you!

1504
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,640
Oh my god.

1505
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,460
I'm fucking helping you!

1506
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,630
He hates you specifically.

1507
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,620
Bro, I'm just hoping they would shoot them!

1508
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,040
Bro, I'm so mad.

1509
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,540
I'm so mad.

1510
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,550
You are a bigger fucker.

1511
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,440
Cause it's so hard to shoot them.

1512
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,120
The gun I have right now.

1513
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,620
They hate you more.

1514
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,620
They're like, fuck you in particular.

1515
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,600
Oh, I thought I could...

1516
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,480
Oh shit.

1517
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,560
I thought the glass was breakable.

1518
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,380
Just in case.

1519
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,540
I knew it!

1520
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:18,420
I fucking...

1521
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,380
I knew it!

1522
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:23,200
I fucking knew it was pretending to be dead too!

1523
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,320
I am...

1524
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,720
It's like, wait...

1525
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,460
I was like, he's like, wait, wait, wait.

1526
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,580
Wait a minute.

1527
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,320
Wait a minute.

1528
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,480
Oh my god.

1529
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,680
I swear to god.

1530
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:40,660
Fucking...

1531
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,380
Kill him!

1532
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,940
God damn it!

1533
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,440
Are you serious?

1534
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,640
Are you serious?

1535
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,580
He actually got...

1536
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,660
Oh, I'm shooting them down.

1537
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:49,740
Fuck this.

1538
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,920
I'm shooting them down.

1539
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,800
I gave you too much.

1540
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,560
I already gave you too much of a chance to live.

1541
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,520
That's right.

1542
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,640
You don't deserve anymore.

1543
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,760
There you go.

1544
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,580
Get out of here.

1545
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,840
I'll fight them myself.

1546
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,260
I don't need you.

1547
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,620
I don't fucking need you.

1548
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:23,450
You know what?

1549
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:24,770
You could have lived.

1550
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:25,430
You could have lived.

1551
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:26,670
I would have let them live.

1552
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:30,670
I would have.

1553
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,150
I was going to.

1554
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:34,750
But no.

1555
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,830
No, he's gotta be a little bitch about it.

1556
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,470
We needed this though.

1557
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:43,870
I'm gonna get rid of these guys.

1558
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,290
What is that?

1559
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,070
Alright.

1560
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:52,070
That's right.

1561
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:52,730
Back shots.

1562
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:55,550
Alright.

1563
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:55,770
Okay.

1564
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:56,270
These guys.

1565
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:58,830
I'm not wasting any ammo on them.

1566
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:00,490
Get out of here.

1567
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:01,650
Popcorn!

1568
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:02,930
Popcorn!

1569
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:04,810
Popcorn!

1570
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:07,770
There we go.

1571
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:09,310
Oh shit.

1572
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:10,530
That's a lot of them.

1573
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:11,770
Uh.

1574
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:13,270
Boop.

1575
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:14,350
Pop.

1576
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:15,530
Pop.

1577
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:16,750
Pop.

1578
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,110
Pop.

1579
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:20,030
Get out of here.

1580
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:21,650
Get out of here.

1581
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,010
Your life doesn't matter.

1582
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:24,390
Get out of here.

1583
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:25,630
What are you gonna do?

1584
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:26,930
I have armor on.

1585
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,190
You can't get inside me.

1586
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:29,450
I have armor.

1587
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:30,870
Fucking right.

1588
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,150
Man.

1589
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:34,350
Alright.

1590
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,710
Alright, let's go.

1591
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:44,740
That's right.

1592
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,920
Our protection.

1593
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,160
You think about it.

1594
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,260
My armor is gonna protect me.

1595
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,940
And save me from God.

1596
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,080
Save me for God.

1597
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,460
There you go.

1598
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,360
Let's see.

1599
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,960
What the fuck?

1600
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,240
What's that sound?

1601
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,920
Oh shit!

1602
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:18,760
Alright.

1603
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,240
Nice.

1604
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,340
Oh my god.

1605
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:24,700
Okay.

1606
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,060
The non-bullet-proof glass.

1607
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,750
Gotta make sure those pop.

1608
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:35,770
There wasn't a lot.

1609
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:37,030
There wasn't a lot.

1610
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:37,370
As before.

1611
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:40,770
Actually, I'm just gonna throw these names.

1612
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,030
What the fuck?

1613
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:42,890
I thought you were all dead.

1614
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:43,510
What the fuck?

1615
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,270
You guys missed!

1616
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:45,990
Oh fuck!

1617
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:46,650
I got distracted!

1618
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,570
Why are they all like, just standing there like a gang?

1619
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:54,770
Okay.

1620
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:55,050
Okay.

1621
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:55,110
Guys.

1622
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:55,430
Guys.

1623
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:55,950
Chill!

1624
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,350
I'll get to you later!

1625
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:01,590
Oh!

1626
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:03,730
Oh!

1627
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:04,770
Oh!

1628
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:04,990
Oh!

1629
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,370
Okay.

1630
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:05,850
Okay.

1631
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,630
I was gonna say like, what the fuck was that sound?

1632
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:09,890
Okay.

1633
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:10,230
It's okay.

1634
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,710
I have a window.

1635
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,210
I have a window.

1636
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:13,930
I have a window!

1637
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:15,850
That was a lot of them.

1638
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:17,210
That's fine.

1639
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:18,570
You should all be dead.

1640
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:22,710
Alright.

1641
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,410
This way.

1642
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,940
You don't need armor.

1643
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:30,600
It's okay.

1644
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,280
The popcorn just wants to hold your hand.

1645
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,140
Thank you for the super chat.

1646
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:35,900
Ginger.

1647
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:36,360
Thank you.

1648
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:37,140
Thank you.

1649
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:39,760
Alright.

1650
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:40,780
Up I go.

1651
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,380
Oh.

1652
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,460
Down I go.

1653
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,260
Nevermind.

1654
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,680
Down I go.

1655
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,680
What the fuck?

1656
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,100
What the fuck?

1657
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:53,980
Yeah.

1658
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,640
This is my elevator.

1659
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,380
Alright.

1660
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:02,620
This.

1661
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,880
You think I...

1662
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,160
Oh, you thought you could...

1663
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,000
What the fuck?

1664
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:07,720
Still here?

1665
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:09,620
Bro.

1666
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,400
Oh my god!

1667
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,580
When does it stop?

1668
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:20,560
Alright.

1669
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,160
That's fine.

1670
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,300
That should be all of them.

1671
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:27,050
Hmm.

1672
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,850
Bro, it's like rain.

1673
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:31,890
Oh, they're dancing.

1674
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:34,970
Just in case.

1675
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:36,790
Oh, I fucking knew it.

1676
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,850
I knew you were a fuck.

1677
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,110
Just in case.

1678
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,570
Oh, I hear them right beside me.

1679
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,610
There's a bunch of popcorn to my right.

1680
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:49,650
I hear them.

1681
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:51,630
They're ready to pop.

1682
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,370
Wait.

1683
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,090
No?

1684
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:55,790
I didn't hear them?

1685
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:57,950
Oh, I guess I didn't.

1686
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:58,930
Guess I'm crazy.

1687
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:02,370
Hello?

1688
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:04,550
Oh?

1689
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,810
Oh, I don't like this area.

1690
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,380
Kill him in particular.

1691
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,920
With that one guy though.

1692
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,150
I just want...

1693
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:19,670
I don't want to be...

1694
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,370
waste my...

1695
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,490
shotgun yet.

1696
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,110
If I can.

1697
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:26,810
I hear them.

1698
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,910
I hear a lot of them somewhere.

1699
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,050
Yeah, I don't know.

1700
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,790
I don't feel comfortable being in like, such an open area.

1701
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:38,150
I hear like...

1702
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:41,510
I hear them like, just calling for me.

1703
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,150
Like Doki.

1704
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:44,310
Doki.

1705
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:45,570
Come on.

1706
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:46,830
Come on.

1707
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:47,710
Eat the apple.

1708
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:50,530
Oh, there you are.

1709
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:54,530
There you go.

1710
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,260
Come on.

1711
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,680
All your friends are doing it.

1712
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:02,900
Is it?

1713
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,420
Did I come from here?

1714
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,940
No, I didn't.

1715
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,040
Okay.

1716
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,060
Okay.

1717
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:18,920
Okay.

1718
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,740
Let's take care of the next pulse generator.

1719
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,860
I'm gonna die.

1720
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,620
I'm gonna die here.

1721
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,380
I'm gonna...

1722
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,060
Alright.

1723
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:34,580
Nevermind.

1724
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:35,740
I'll just...

1725
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:36,660
I'll just stay here.

1726
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,840
Stay here.

1727
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,120
I'm just...

1728
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,220
That's fine.

1729
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:46,820
Okay.

1730
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,500
Let me die.

1731
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:48,700
Let me...

1732
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:48,920
No.

1733
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,380
Get me...

1734
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:50,940
No, no.

1735
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:51,820
Get me out of here.

1736
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:52,980
Get me out of here.

1737
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:53,620
No, no, no.

1738
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,080
Get me...

1739
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:54,620
No, no, no.

1740
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,420
Oh, now you can't aim at me.

1741
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,120
Okay.

1742
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,240
I have to walk.

1743
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,180
Oh, now he misses.

1744
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:01,980
I see.

1745
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,240
I see.

1746
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:03,840
I...

1747
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,560
I was like, wow.

1748
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,520
He hits the fucking shot of his life.

1749
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,960
And now he missed every other shot after that.

1750
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:11,720
No, I get it.

1751
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:12,420
I...

1752
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,360
I fucking get it.

1753
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,220
Fuck me, right?

1754
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,500
Like, how do I...

1755
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:20,920
What?

1756
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,920
I'm gonna wait a little bit.

1757
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,000
I don't have a...

1758
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,900
Oh my god.

1759
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:36,960
Okay.

1760
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,760
I'm just gonna...

1761
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,480
Get to a safe part first.

1762
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:46,960
Before I...

1763
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,640
Let me just have a little fucking car fight.

1764
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,400
OH MY GOD!

1765
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,100
Guess I won't do that.

1766
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,320
I guess I won't.

1767
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,060
Fuck this.

1768
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,200
Okay, nice.

1769
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:01,880
There's healers here.

1770
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,620
Okay, there's better be a fucking rocket launcher.

1771
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,340
Oh my god.

1772
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:05,880
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1773
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,120
There better be a goddamn rocket launcher.

1774
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,260
Over here.

1775
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:13,880
Alright, where is he?

1776
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,900
That's fucking right.

1777
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:20,900
Get out of here.

1778
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,200
Get your ass out of here.

1779
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:27,420
Alright.

1780
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,700
Where's that stupid tank?

1781
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,350
Where is it?

1782
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:39,950
No!

1783
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:43,970
Oh my god.

1784
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:44,950
This fucking sucks.

1785
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,390
I'm gonna get rid of this too.

1786
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:47,850
And then I'll get rid of him.

1787
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:51,050
Oh my god.

1788
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,370
Please.

1789
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:54,870
I need to get rid of him.

1790
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:56,290
Alright, nice.

1791
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:00,590
Oh my god.

1792
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,070
That's fine.

1793
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:01,450
That's fine.

1794
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:01,850
That's fine.

1795
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:02,270
We're alive.

1796
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,090
Get rid of that.

1797
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:04,530
Get rid of him first.

1798
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:06,130
We're alive.

1799
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:07,450
You know what?

1800
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:08,970
Fuck this guy too, in particular.

1801
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:16,270
Oh my god.

1802
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:16,930
I swear to god.

1803
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,670
It will blow you up.

1804
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,350
Get out of here.

1805
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:27,790
It was worth it.

1806
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:30,050
It was worth it.

1807
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:31,610
It was worth it.

1808
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:32,050
How do I...

1809
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,850
How do I fucking leave?

1810
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:36,690
Okay.

1811
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,350
One more shot.

1812
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:39,690
No, I... I shouldn't.

1813
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:44,630
What?

1814
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:44,910
Oh shit.

1815
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:46,070
No, that's not why I want it.

1816
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:47,270
How do I...

1817
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:48,350
How do I get up there?

1818
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,400
Alright.

1819
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:53,380
What?

1820
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,520
Guys, I know you can't rocket jump.

1821
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:01,140
I...

1822
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:02,540
Get...

1823
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,320
Fuck with me.

1824
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,140
Don't fuck with me right now.

1825
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,320
I just go forward?

1826
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,280
Guys, we tried this before.

1827
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:15,900
Press...

1828
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,520
Press...

1829
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,100
Just press jump really hard.

1830
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:18,920
It'll work.

1831
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,460
I guess I go down.

1832
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,920
And you guys, they patched it.

1833
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,160
Jerky, by the time you got there, they patched it.

1834
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,180
Don't worry.

1835
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,860
Oh, I guess I go down.

1836
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,820
Yeah, they patched it just for me.

1837
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,460
Wait, guys.

1838
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,400
What about this?

1839
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:41,900
Hey, guys.

1840
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,900
Is this a secret tunnel?

1841
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,940
I thought the rocket jumped, guys.

1842
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,940
Why do I...

1843
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:46,960
Why am I here, huh?

1844
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,100
Why am I...

1845
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,200
Why am I here, huh?

1846
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,840
I thought you said the rocket jumped.

1847
01:08:59,320 --> 01:08:59,620
Jesus.

1848
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,280
Oh my god.

1849
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,220
He charged that up just for me.

1850
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,920
It's the alternative path.

1851
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,220
You won't understand.

1852
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,640
What does...

1853
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,980
I will break your shield.

1854
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:13,720
Oh shit.

1855
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,260
You'll break my shield first, apparently.

1856
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:18,780
Fucker.

1857
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,800
That's right.

1858
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,500
I'm patient.

1859
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:28,530
Alright.

1860
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:28,690
Alright.

1861
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:32,030
Oh nice.

1862
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:32,890
Someone died here.

1863
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:37,690
I'll grab this.

1864
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,190
And then...

1865
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:42,570
Health.

1866
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:45,350
And then I get my car.

1867
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:49,530
Alright.

1868
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,610
I don't know if it's good to be on the car though.

1869
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:58,510
Actually.

1870
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:04,230
Get over here.

1871
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,790
There we go.

1872
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:07,430
I'm like thinking.

1873
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:09,410
Like...

1874
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:11,250
Oh wait.

1875
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,130
Like what do I do with my car?

1876
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:16,350
Yeah.

1877
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:16,970
I was gonna say.

1878
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:18,630
Who's getting my...

1879
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,770
I guess I could just run over people.

1880
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,710
Get over here.

1881
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,000
Get over here.

1882
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,040
You fucker.

1883
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,000
Oh thank god.

1884
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,300
Oh thank god.

1885
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,560
It passes through the car.

1886
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:34,240
I was gonna say.

1887
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,740
I will die with you.

1888
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:36,700
I am...

1889
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,320
I was ready to die with him.

1890
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:43,020
Alright.

1891
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,200
I can use it as a cover, right?

1892
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:49,940
Holy shit.

1893
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:50,280
Wait.

1894
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,540
Oh shit.

1895
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:57,460
Okay.

1896
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,540
That was pretty sick.

1897
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,580
Using that as cover.

1898
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:05,060
Let me

1899
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:11,130
kill this first.

1900
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:13,950
Oh my god.

1901
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,970
Oh my god.

1902
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:15,530
It's these guys.

1903
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,330
I forgot they existed.

1904
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:21,450
Okay.

1905
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,250
He has to turn his backs.

1906
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,130
Are you fucking kidding me?

1907
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,590
Are you fucking kidding me?

1908
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:31,910
I am already going through so much.

1909
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:34,250
Okay.

1910
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:35,390
He has to turn his back.

1911
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,110
No.

1912
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,090
I'm so bad at this.

1913
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:44,670
Worth it.

1914
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:50,490
Worth it.

1915
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:54,900
Alright.

1916
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,420
Oh.

1917
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,020
Not here.

1918
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:00,620
Alright.

1919
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,500
Do I go this way?

1920
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:04,700
Oh my god.

1921
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,540
I'm so lost.

1922
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,720
I'm so fucking lost.

1923
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,400
Oh there it is.

1924
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:10,480
Guys.

1925
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,460
Can I just...

1926
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,820
Explode it with my...

1927
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:13,200
Gun?

1928
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:15,060
Wait.

1929
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,300
Can I just...

1930
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,060
Destroy it with a pistol?

1931
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:17,560
Guys?

1932
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,040
Or no?

1933
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:22,840
No?

1934
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:23,480
Alright.

1935
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,320
I'll just leave.

1936
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:25,620
Goodbye.

1937
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,120
God!

1938
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,260
They're like...

1939
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,480
You can never leave.

1940
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:37,660
Keep.

1941
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,780
Oh my god.

1942
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:41,440
He saw me.

1943
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:42,380
Oh no.

1944
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,740
He saw me.

1945
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:47,700
Okay.

1946
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:49,640
Alright.

1947
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,420
We just go this way.

1948
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,620
God dammit.

1949
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:56,760
Wait.

1950
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,560
I can just steal it?

1951
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,460
I'm going in.

1952
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,100
I'm going in.

1953
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:00,640
God.

1954
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,600
Thank you for the super champ.

1955
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:01,960
Thank you.

1956
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,620
Thank you.

1957
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,020
Alright.

1958
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:09,470
Oh my...

1959
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:09,710
Guys.

1960
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:10,130
I...

1961
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:12,730
I'm starting to not believe guys.

1962
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,400
I gotta do this again.

1963
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,200
Okay.

1964
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:21,380
Watch this though.

1965
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,220
Oh my god.

1966
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,500
They do this guy again too.

1967
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,000
God dammit.

1968
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,740
I have to kill him again too.

1969
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:39,930
God dammit.

1970
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,420
I hate them.

1971
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,500
I hate them so much.

1972
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,800
I have to do this all over again.

1973
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:47,660
I...

1974
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:53,170
Eh.

1975
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:58,440
I'm so sad.

1976
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,080
Cause it was so cool too.

1977
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:01,860
Are you serious?

1978
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,840
You're fucking double teaming?

1979
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,240
That's fucking...

1980
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:05,740
Get out of here.

1981
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:06,920
Get out of here.

1982
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,600
Get your ass out of here.

1983
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:08,660
Get out of here.

1984
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:15,330
Oh my god.

1985
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:27,390
Oh my god.

1986
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:28,770
I have to deal with these guys.

1987
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:33,820
Here we go.

1988
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,240
I don't know why he ran back.

1989
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,600
He got scared for some reason.

1990
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:45,010
Or maybe you have to run back too.

1991
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,230
I don't know.

1992
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:49,190
Here we go.

1993
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:51,750
Stupid.

1994
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:53,650
Stupid.

1995
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:56,850
Alright.

1996
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:58,490
Let's go.

1997
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:03,870
I don't need the galling gun.

1998
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:05,030
I have a pistol.

1999
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:07,250
Okay.

2000
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,350
Let's get the galling gun.

2001
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:17,130
Alright.

2002
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:19,490
There you go.

2003
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:22,310
Come on.

2004
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:22,810
Peak.

2005
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:27,700
Okay.

2006
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,880
Get your ass out of here.

2007
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,700
There's no way that's gonna hit me, right?

2008
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:31,800
No.

2009
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,280
He misses.

2010
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,840
He misses those.

2011
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,100
Guys.

2012
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:36,700
Guys!

2013
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:37,180
Guys!

2014
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:38,860
Okay.

2015
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,080
He does not miss those.

2016
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:41,640
He does not.

2017
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:42,660
He doesn't miss those.

2018
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:43,880
He doesn't miss those apparently.

2019
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,060
Oh my god.

2020
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,760
Oh my god.

2021
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,840
It's so hard to see where it's gonna hit.

2022
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:56,860
Okay.

2023
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:56,940
Okay.

2024
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,480
Oh my god.

2025
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:58,940
No.

2026
01:15:59,100 --> 01:15:59,700
What's hitting me?

2027
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:00,520
What's hitting me?

2028
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,420
As long as I fly.

2029
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,360
Can't get me.

2030
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,280
As long as...

2031
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,940
Is that coming towards me?

2032
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:10,400
Weeeeee.

2033
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,400
I'm so sad.

2034
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,080
I'm actually so sad.

2035
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,700
I don't know what killed me.

2036
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,160
I don't know.

2037
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,220
I killed my s- I can do that?!

2038
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:57,870
That- What the fuck my- That can happen- Oh my god.

2039
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,650
I can crash.

2040
01:16:58,850 --> 01:16:59,890
Oh my god.

2041
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,130
Nobody told me I could just fucking crash.

2042
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,350
Oh my god.

2043
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,220
I didn't know.

2044
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,380
I didn't know that was a thing.

2045
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,180
I used to- Okay, that's fine.

2046
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,000
I'll take it.

2047
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,500
I didn't know that was a thing.

2048
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:39,960
I can't.

2049
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,900
I can't.

2050
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:45,240
I can't deal with this.

2051
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,100
Oh my god.

2052
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:49,960
They're everywhere.

2053
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:58,910
I'm so sad.

2054
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,690
I was- I did this to myself.

2055
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:01,850
No.

2056
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:10,630
The second level.

2057
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:15,550
The second level is like the death of me right now.

2058
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:17,770
It is actually...

2059
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:19,370
The worst.

2060
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:25,670
Fucking hell, this is the worst level.

2061
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,030
I'm fucking waiting for the Banshee to show up.

2062
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:31,210
Show its goddamn face.

2063
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:32,150
There you are.

2064
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,450
I knew you'd show up.

2065
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:36,070
Get out of here.

2066
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:40,050
I knew you'd fucking show up and show your goddamn face.

2067
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,070
Oh my god.

2068
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,810
It's like this fucktoki.

2069
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:50,270
In particular.

2070
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:15,610
He actually...

2071
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:17,330
He actually did it.

2072
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:20,170
He actually fucking did it.

2073
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:25,430
Oh my god.

2074
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:26,410
The Mad Men.

2075
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:30,410
The fucking Mad Men actually did it.

2076
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:33,390
Oh my god.

2077
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:37,070
Get out.

2078
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:37,830
Get out!

2079
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:41,270
Oh my god.

2080
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:42,370
I thought he was gonna do it again.

2081
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:44,430
I thought he was gonna do it again.

2082
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,630
I legitimately thought he was gonna do it.

2083
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:53,870
Oh my- Oh I- Are you serious?

2084
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:55,650
I used to- It hit me twice.

2085
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:56,510
It hit me twice.

2086
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:57,770
Oh my god.

2087
01:19:58,310 --> 01:19:58,750
Oh my god.

2088
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,550
It actually hit me.

2089
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,170
Oh my god.

2090
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:02,110
Today's not a good day.

2091
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:04,090
Today is not a good day for Doki.

2092
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,220
Okay, we're just gonna kill this guy.

2093
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,840
I-I'm missing everything.

2094
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,740
I'm-I'm just not ha- I'm-I'm not okay anymore.

2095
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,500
I'm- I'm not okay.

2096
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,140
Oh my god.

2097
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:29,840
I don't know.

2098
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:30,820
I don't know.

2099
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,840
I don't know.

2100
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:37,220
I hit every shot before and now I hit nothing.

2101
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,100
Now I can't anymore.

2102
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:40,900
I-I'm not.

2103
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:44,780
I'm-I'm a-I'm a shadow of a man right now.

2104
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,200
I-I'm what I once was.

2105
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,000
I-

2106
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,940
I hate this tank.

2107
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,580
I hate this tank so fucking much.

2108
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:59,780
I-I-I don't know if it's gonna hit me or not.

2109
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,420
Oh my god, it's getting closer isn't it.

2110
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,180
Oh my god.

2111
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:16,980
I'm so scared.

2112
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,220
No it's five.

2113
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,180
It's FIVE.

2114
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,680
It's fine.

2115
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,280
I'll stay here until it works.

2116
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:31,490
Please.

2117
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:32,310
Please.

2118
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:34,170
Oh my god.

2119
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,790
Every time it gets closer.

2120
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:38,650
It feels like it's getting closer, guys.

2121
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:42,810
It really does feel like it's getting closer.

2122
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,510
I'm suppressing fire.

2123
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:52,190
There we go.

2124
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:00,590
Okay, we're fine.

2125
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:05,730
I just have to kill this.

2126
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:06,290
Okay.

2127
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:06,790
Okay.

2128
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:08,830
We just... make sure we don't crash.

2129
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,430
We gotta make sure we don't crash.

2130
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,290
Alright, up we go.

2131
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:16,410
Wee!

2132
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,110
Just don't crash.

2133
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:24,650
Just don't fucking crash.

2134
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:31,630
Oh my god.

2135
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:32,910
Oh my god.

2136
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:33,970
Get me.

2137
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:35,310
Get me out of here.

2138
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:36,070
Get me.

2139
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:37,290
Get me out of here.

2140
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:38,530
Oh, we made it.

2141
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:39,630
We fucking made it.

2142
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:45,750
Oh my god.

2143
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,610
We made it, everyone.

2144
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,270
Holy shit.

2145
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:54,050
Oh my god.

2146
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,490
Oh no.

2147
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:02,510
Oh no.

2148
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:04,610
Oh no.

2149
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:11,860
Okay.

2150
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:12,880
Okay.

2151
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,180
Oh my god.

2152
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:14,500
Okay.

2153
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:15,800
Okay, we're fine.

2154
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:22,100
Alright.

2155
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:24,720
We're okay.

2156
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,740
There we go.

2157
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,400
There we go.

2158
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:37,390
Of course.

2159
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:38,910
A fucking course.

2160
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:40,710
A fucking cortes.

2161
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:43,050
Oh fucking course!

2162
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:46,830
They're just all there.

2163
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:47,990
They're just all there!

2164
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,520
Ah!

2165
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:54,620
I'm bugging it!

2166
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:57,880
Okay.

2167
01:23:58,420 --> 01:23:59,100
Okay.

2168
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,020
Okay.

2169
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:04,180
Alright.

2170
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,300
That's fine.

2171
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:15,660
Oh my god.

2172
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:16,280
I'm not okay.

2173
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,360
I'm not okay.

2174
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,120
I am actually not okay.

2175
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,020
I'm not okay.

2176
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,880
I am not okay right now.

2177
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,340
I... Holy shit.

2178
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,680
One HP and a dream.

2179
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,220
Okay.

2180
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,540
Please tell me there's health packs.

2181
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,980
Please tell me there's a health pack.

2182
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,080
This is the hardest level.

2183
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,040
Good luck chasing you in the super chat.

2184
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:46,520
Thank you.

2185
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:47,240
Thank you.

2186
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,400
Alright.

2187
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,780
We're okay.

2188
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,500
We're okay.

2189
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,540
We're okay.

2190
01:24:59,180 --> 01:24:59,860
Hello.

2191
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,020
Tunnels below?

2192
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,240
I... I swear to god.

2193
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,040
Is that a plane?

2194
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,840
Is that a god damn plane?

2195
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,420
Let's take care of the final pullback.

2196
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:33,460
Okay.

2197
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:33,660
Good.

2198
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:34,260
He killed himself.

2199
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:36,900
Okay.

2200
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:38,400
He killed himself.

2201
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:41,440
Where do I go?

2202
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,500
Oh my god.

2203
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:46,940
Where the fuck do I go?

2204
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:53,620
Where do I go?

2205
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:54,660
Flight... Oh wait.

2206
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:55,640
Oh I remember.

2207
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,140
Okay.

2208
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:57,340
Oh okay.

2209
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,140
This way over here.

2210
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:05,510
Oh my god.

2211
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:06,950
He can't...

2212
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,530
He can't reach me.

2213
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,350
He can't reach me.

2214
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:10,150
He can't reach me.

2215
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,520
He can't reach me.

2216
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:18,960
He can't reach me.

2217
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,680
He can't reach me.

2218
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,140
He can't reach me.

2219
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:20,160
He can't reach me.

2220
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,500
He can't reach me.

2221
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:20,640
He can reach me.

2222
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:20,900
He can reach me.

2223
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:21,340
He can reach me.

2224
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:21,920
He can reach me.

2225
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:22,360
He can reach me.

2226
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,860
He can reach me.

2227
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:45,280
I can't make it.

2228
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:51,600
I thought that guy... I thought that guy wouldn't kill me.

2229
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:56,200
We'll need to find him, or his neural implants, to start the fusion core detonation.

2230
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,700
One target remaining.

2231
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,680
Let's take care of the final pulse generator.

2232
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,840
So close to the ceiling.

2233
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:10,700
Damn.

2234
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,200
He can't see me.

2235
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2236
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:34,630
Open the door.

2237
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:36,830
Open the door, open the door.

2238
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:39,470
Open the door!

2239
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:42,890
Oh my god, I have to open the door.

2240
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,580
Oh my god, oh my god.

2241
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:57,920
Go through these.

2242
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,620
I'm crisp in the air.

2243
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,940
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

2244
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,220
Are you fucking kidding me?

2245
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,720
I can't break- NOOO!

2246
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:07,840
No!

2247
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,720
He won't let me bring him through.

2248
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,780
That's so fucked up.

2249
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,480
That's actually so fucked up.

2250
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:23,890
Oh my god.

2251
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:26,630
I thought I could bring the banshee over.

2252
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:31,810
I had hope for like five seconds.

2253
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:33,410
I thought I could just fly over.

2254
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:38,980
Okay.

2255
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:40,000
Okay.

2256
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:43,380
I'm serious.

2257
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,620
I can't be bothered.

2258
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,240
I had to.

2259
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:51,640
I decided to use it.

2260
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:59,060
Just to double tap.

2261
01:28:59,240 --> 01:28:59,880
I knew it.

2262
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:02,100
I was like, you were so far away from that shot.

2263
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,320
There was no way.

2264
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:07,830
Alright.

2265
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:13,880
I'm just kidding.

2266
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,720
Oh my god, who's shooting me?

2267
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:17,160
Oh!

2268
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:22,620
Oh no.

2269
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,480
Oh, they're shooting me.

2270
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:27,960
They're shooting back now.

2271
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:31,720
They know!

2272
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:35,900
Okay.

2273
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,300
Alright.

2274
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,960
I needed new guns.

2275
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:44,760
Oh, they shoot back.

2276
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,240
Oh, thank god!

2277
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,380
Oh my god!

2278
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,220
They're evolving!

2279
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:53,910
They're evolving!

2280
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:54,290
Okay.

2281
01:29:56,410 --> 01:29:57,490
Open sesame.

2282
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:02,430
My only weakness bullets!

2283
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:03,950
How did they know?

2284
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,590
How did they know that was my only weakness?

2285
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:13,490
They knew they were...

2286
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:14,370
They knew.

2287
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,550
They knew.

2288
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:14,770
They knew.

2289
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:16,090
Try to bring the banshee.

2290
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:16,890
Falcor.

2291
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:17,790
Thank you, the super chat.

2292
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:18,230
Thank you.

2293
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:18,870
Thank you.

2294
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:19,230
Thank you.

2295
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:19,670
Oh my god.

2296
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:20,830
Combat evolved.

2297
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:29,940
You don't remember?

2298
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,780
Maybe it used to look like this for you.

2299
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,820
This is what it used to look like.

2300
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:35,660
Sorry, flashbang.

2301
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,980
My eyes!

2302
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:50,460
Wait.

2303
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,160
Did I make it?

2304
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,680
Is this the last chapter?

2305
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:56,000
Oh my...

2306
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,340
Guys!

2307
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,000
I think I'm at the last chapter, guys!

2308
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,200
The final run!

2309
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,820
Oh my god.

2310
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,040
Oh no.

2311
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:07,460
Okay.

2312
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:07,940
Nevermind.

2313
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:11,260
Nevermind.

2314
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:12,580
I'm not at the last chapter.

2315
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,100
I don't know.

2316
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:13,840
I don't know.

2317
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:14,460
I don't know.

2318
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,680
It said final run.

2319
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:18,020
I assumed that meant final chapter.

2320
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,520
How did that miss all of them?

2321
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,440
Just let it pop.

2322
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,720
Of this level.

2323
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:32,440
I think we can just fight each other.

2324
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,140
I'm okay with that.

2325
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:33,940
I swear to God.

2326
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:34,760
I broke the...

2327
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:35,540
I...

2328
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,400
I located the pillar of autumn.

2329
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,980
She put down twelve hundred kilometers up spin.

2330
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,760
Energy readings show her fusion reactors are still powered up.

2331
01:31:57,580 --> 01:32:00,260
The systems on the pillar of autumn have fail-saves.

2332
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:03,100
Even I can't override without authorization from the captain.

2333
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:07,700
We'll need to find him or his neural implants to start the fusion core detonation.

2334
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:08,740
There's no checkpoint?

2335
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,280
One target remaining.

2336
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,180
Let's take care of the final pulse generator.

2337
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:12,920
There's...

2338
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:19,610
What?

2339
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,600
Where did my checkpoint go?

2340
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:25,880
Where...

2341
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:26,900
Where...

2342
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:29,600
Where...

2343
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:30,320
Where...

2344
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,680
Where...

2345
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:32,920
Where...

2346
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:33,580
Where...

2347
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:33,760
Where...

2348
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,260
Where...

2349
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,240
How is there no checkpoint?

2350
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,060
Oh!

2351
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,460
Oh my God!

2352
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,460
And he's gonna...

2353
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,020
Oh, my bad!

2354
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:39,800
She's...

2355
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,800
Oh my God!

2356
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:50,460
Oh my God!

2357
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:51,520
I don't understand!

2358
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,300
Wow there's gonna be a lot.

2359
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,980
What did my checkpoint go!

2360
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:00,900
It's God!

2361
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:06,200
Aren't I supposed to have a checkpoint?!

2362
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,080
It bugged out.

2363
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:15,000
That actually happened to me.

2364
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,180
The checkpoint actually bugged out.

2365
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,680
Oh my god.

2366
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:25,080
I was supposed to have a checkpoint and it actually bugged out.

2367
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,580
That's... oh my god.

2368
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,680
Oh my god.

2369
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,060
How is that possible?

2370
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:38,840
Oh my

2371
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:50,470
god.

2372
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,120
I can't believe.

2373
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:58,980
I can't believe.

2374
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,380
I can't believe it.

2375
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,640
Oh my god.

2376
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:03,700
Checkpoint done.

2377
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:04,760
I can't.

2378
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:05,280
Where is it?

2379
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:05,920
Where is it?

2380
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,340
It didn't show save.

2381
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,720
It didn't not show checkpoints.

2382
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,300
How is that possible?

2383
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,780
How is that possible?

2384
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,300
How do I have zero checkpoints?

2385
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:26,720
That's actually crazy.

2386
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,900
Oh my god.

2387
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,240
I don't even know.

2388
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,640
I don't even know if I got the checkpoint here.

2389
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,380
Oh my god.

2390
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,180
I went through so much.

2391
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:51,500
I actually did so much.

2392
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:55,600
That's crazy that there was no checkpoint.

2393
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:58,200
That's actually crazy.

2394
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,640
That... I can't believe they did that to me.

2395
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:07,920
I can't believe they did that.

2396
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,860
Oh my god.

2397
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:14,060
They actually did that to me.

2398
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,680
Oh my god.

2399
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,820
After everything I've been through.

2400
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:28,370
Oh.

2401
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:32,950
Oh.

2402
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:33,050
Oh.

2403
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:35,090
Oh.

2404
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:41,790
Oh my god.

2405
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:42,650
That guy was crazy.

2406
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,730
That guy was actually crazy.

2407
01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:50,410
Holy shit.

2408
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:51,070
Holy shit.

2409
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:53,270
He knew he was gonna be dead.

2410
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:56,030
Oh, where's...

2411
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:58,370
I can't believe it.

2412
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:01,950
I can't believe it took me all the way there.

2413
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:03,150
I...

2414
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,490
Come on.

2415
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:08,050
Where's checkpoint?

2416
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:09,390
Come on.

2417
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:10,570
Checkpoint.

2418
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:10,670
What?

2419
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:12,310
No name to you.

2420
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:14,010
The super chat that you think.

2421
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,010
Where's the checkpoint?

2422
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:17,650
Where is it?

2423
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:18,450
Where is it?

2424
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:19,430
Was checkpoint done?

2425
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:20,930
Please.

2426
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:22,730
Where is it?

2427
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:33,660
Oh no.

2428
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,020
Oh no.

2429
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,520
Oh no.

2430
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:39,120
Checkpoint.

2431
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:42,620
I'm here.

2432
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,580
I'm here.

2433
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:45,220
I'm here.

2434
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:45,800
Checkpoint done.

2435
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,140
Checkpoint save?

2436
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,520
Checkpoint.

2437
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:58,720
What's that?

2438
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:01,100
That's it?

2439
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:01,600
Okay.

2440
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:02,460
Okay.

2441
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:03,780
Okay.

2442
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:10,510
Okay.

2443
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:10,530
Okay.

2444
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:11,750
Alright.

2445
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:13,330
I believe.

2446
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:15,790
I believe.

2447
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:18,310
I'm gonna go to the left side.

2448
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:19,770
It seems safer.

2449
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:26,250
I'll just let them fight a little bit.

2450
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:29,190
I swear to god.

2451
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:36,690
Okay.

2452
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:37,930
You better fucking die.

2453
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:40,610
Oh my god.

2454
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:43,730
Oh!

2455
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:52,660
Holy shit.

2456
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:53,620
They all came after me.

2457
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,300
Oh my god.

2458
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:57,540
They all came after me.

2459
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:02,820
They just all wanted me dead.

2460
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:03,880
Oh.

2461
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:04,800
I can't go left.

2462
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,560
I actually can't go left.

2463
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:11,280
Let's see if I can get the guy on this.

2464
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,500
Oh my god.

2465
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,680
They all turned around.

2466
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:17,920
They actually all turned around.

2467
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:21,140
What is fucking wrong with these freaks?

2468
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:26,730
Okay.

2469
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,420
You have alerted the horde.

2470
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:40,620
I actually did.

2471
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:45,580
Oh my god.

2472
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:46,040
They won.

2473
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:47,300
The flood won.

2474
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:54,490
Okay.

2475
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:55,180
We gotta find...

2476
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:57,690
A gun replacement for this.

2477
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:00,830
Anywhere.

2478
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:02,450
Anywhere.

2479
01:39:02,650 --> 01:39:02,790
Anywhere, please.

2480
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,230
Uh...

2481
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:05,990
Oh, my God.

2482
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:06,970
I want a needler.

2483
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:07,390
Okay.

2484
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:08,190
Not anywhere.

2485
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:11,210
Oh my god.

2486
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:13,750
Alright.

2487
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:14,270
That's okay.

2488
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:15,150
We have a car.

2489
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:16,930
It's okay.

2490
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:17,930
We have a car.

2491
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:23,350
Anything but that.

2492
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:32,540
Okay, I'm just gonna back up a little.

2493
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:34,940
Oops.

2494
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:37,360
Okay, maybe that's too much backed up.

2495
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,120
Okay.

2496
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,220
I'm just gonna shoot him.

2497
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:48,360
Okay, let me have your gun.

2498
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:49,260
I actually need your gun.

2499
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,040
Okay, I'll wait.

2500
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:56,980
Except for him.

2501
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:57,580
I'll kill him.

2502
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,200
Oh!

2503
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:04,110
Oh, no.

2504
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:06,010
This is not good.

2505
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:09,710
This is not good.

2506
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11,150
I don't have enough ammo.

2507
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:16,600
Oh, please.

2508
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:17,340
Oh, wait, nice!

2509
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:18,960
There's a gun here!

2510
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,180
Oh, what gun is this?

2511
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,660
Oh, not the gun I needed, but that's okay.

2512
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:28,340
Okay, I'll take it.

2513
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:28,920
I'll just take it.

2514
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,080
That's fine.

2515
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:33,480
That's fine.

2516
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:33,800
Oh, shit.

2517
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:45,890
Alright.

2518
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:47,610
That's fine.

2519
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:50,910
Oh, my God!

2520
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:51,350
Oh!

2521
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:54,010
Are you fucking kidding?

2522
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,000
Oh, my God!

2523
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:58,620
Are you serious?

2524
01:40:58,620 --> 01:40:59,880
I just... Okay, there's a health pack.

2525
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:00,780
There's a health pack.

2526
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:01,000
There's a health pack.

2527
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,160
Thank God.

2528
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:04,960
Oh, thank God.

2529
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,480
Thank God.

2530
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:08,280
It was a health pack.

2531
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:13,520
Oh, thank God.

2532
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:14,440
He blew himself up, too.

2533
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:16,860
And I got shotgun ammo.

2534
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:18,720
Oh!

2535
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:20,660
Everything will be okay.

2536
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:21,460
Doki.

2537
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:22,920
Everything will be okay.

2538
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,240
I got spare heals.

2539
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:26,300
Can you make clutch?

2540
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:32,140
Checkpoint that this better be fucking checkpoint that I swear to God.

2541
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:35,160
I'm playing more careful now because I don't know.

2542
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:38,800
I swear to God, if I die and I go all the way back there, I smile.

2543
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:46,100
Are they fighting the horde?

2544
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,740
Oh, they are.

2545
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:48,700
Okay, I can wait.

2546
01:41:53,070 --> 01:41:54,310
I can't wait.

2547
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:56,570
Never mind.

2548
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:00,870
Maybe they'll kill each other.

2549
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:01,370
Who knows?

2550
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:07,950
Okay, that's fine.

2551
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:08,550
I'll just wait.

2552
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:10,070
I can wait a little.

2553
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:19,440
Yeah, I'm letting them fight.

2554
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,420
I'm trying to make sure if they'll hit me or not.

2555
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:29,050
Okay, I don't know.

2556
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:29,770
Do I go left?

2557
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:31,150
I guess I go left side.

2558
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:37,030
Paying attention to the missiles.

2559
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:47,850
God, why are the missiles locking on me, though?

2560
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:51,590
Like, why is it on me?

2561
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:54,570
I don't understand.

2562
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:56,610
Why?

2563
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,710
Why is it on me?

2564
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:07,250
Okay.

2565
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:11,730
Yeah, I'll go run this way.

2566
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:14,830
I have to run to the left.

2567
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:24,830
I got to run to the left and hope they don't see me.

2568
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:27,150
Oh, my God.

2569
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:28,330
Oh, my God.

2570
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:28,510
Oh, my God.

2571
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,610
It wasn't to the left.

2572
01:43:35,730 --> 01:43:37,350
Oh, my God.

2573
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:39,150
Where do I go?

2574
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:43,470
Oh, my God.

2575
01:43:44,210 --> 01:43:45,050
Oh, fuck.

2576
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:45,350
Yes.

2577
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:46,410
Oh, my God.

2578
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:46,630
Yes.

2579
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:47,510
Oh, fuck.

2580
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:47,790
Yes.

2581
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:49,230
I only have two shots, though.

2582
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:52,950
Oh, and then I missed.

2583
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:54,210
And then I missed.

2584
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:14,340
Okay, that's fine.

2585
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:15,600
That's fine.

2586
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:17,540
Where did I drop my pistol?

2587
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,160
Oh, I don't know where I dropped the pistol.

2588
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:23,500
Oh, there it is.

2589
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:24,080
There it is.

2590
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,400
Where do I go?

2591
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,440
Do I go to the right?

2592
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,740
I don't know where to go.

2593
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:37,060
Oh, my God.

2594
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:37,600
I'm going back.

2595
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:41,120
It's dodging the riots.

2596
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,440
I don't know where to go.

2597
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:49,580
The arrow takes me back.

2598
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:50,900
What do you mean?

2599
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,040
It says go back.

2600
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:01,120
Oh.

2601
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:03,680
Oh, my God.

2602
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:03,940
I know.

2603
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:04,840
I need to take them down.

2604
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:05,540
I need to take them down.

2605
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,640
I actually don't trust myself.

2606
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,080
I don't trust myself.

2607
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,140
I don't trust myself.

2608
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:15,960
I need to take them all down.

2609
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:16,520
I can't.

2610
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:16,880
Guys.

2611
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,160
I know I'll die.

2612
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:18,640
I...

2613
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:19,620
I know.

2614
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:21,080
Guys, I can't.

2615
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:22,240
I'm going back.

2616
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:24,640
Don't trust myself.

2617
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,980
I feel like the mo...

2618
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:34,180
Guys, the moment I grab the banshee, the moment I grab a banshee, the fucking thing is gonna, like...

2619
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:39,340
It's gonna, like, come back and, like, it's a shoot me out of the sky.

2620
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:40,860
We don't gamble here.

2621
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,860
I can tell they're gonna shoot me into the sky.

2622
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:44,320
I...

2623
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:45,520
I feel it.

2624
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,140
Oh, my God.

2625
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:49,080
Where's the rocket?

2626
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,780
Rocket man.

2627
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,420
Give me your rocket.

2628
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:57,560
Okay, where's two more rockets?

2629
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,280
I need two more.

2630
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,960
Alright, here we go.

2631
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:09,000
They're gonna shoot me down.

2632
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:10,000
I can feel it.

2633
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,260
I know they're gonna...

2634
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:12,860
That's the...

2635
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:14,740
I know they're gonna shoot me down.

2636
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:17,640
Alright, here we go.

2637
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:19,380
I'm hungry.

2638
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,320
Guys, how much more do I get...

2639
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:22,260
Of this game do I have?

2640
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,220
I might order food.

2641
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:28,060
I'm hungry.

2642
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:30,800
Alright.

2643
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,800
I now have ten shots.

2644
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:35,680
Two more?

2645
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:36,080
Okay.

2646
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:37,680
Alright.

2647
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:39,740
Okay.

2648
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:43,600
Maxine, you feel like intervention ran.

2649
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:44,160
No, Doki.

2650
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:45,100
You can't get help.

2651
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:47,160
Get in the banshee.

2652
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,860
I don't trust myself.

2653
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:50,440
Wings!

2654
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:55,350
There we go.

2655
01:46:57,290 --> 01:46:58,110
Okay, one down.

2656
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,900
There's no way it's gonna move.

2657
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:08,190
Did it move?

2658
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:10,190
Oh my god.

2659
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:11,170
He moved.

2660
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:12,910
He moved.

2661
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:13,670
He actually moved.

2662
01:47:15,890 --> 01:47:17,650
Oh my god.

2663
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:18,350
That freak.

2664
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:23,030
Okay.

2665
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:25,490
I'm gonna get rid of all of them first.

2666
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,020
Get out of here.

2667
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,080
That's fucking right.

2668
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,040
I will use this.

2669
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:47,550
Oh my god.

2670
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:48,570
There's more?

2671
01:47:49,290 --> 01:47:49,590
Oh.

2672
01:47:56,510 --> 01:47:57,310
No.

2673
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:00,170
No.

2674
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:05,350
Oh no.

2675
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:10,960
Oh no, I don't have a pistol.

2676
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,200
Oh my god.

2677
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:18,420
I don't have a pistol, guys.

2678
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:20,440
This is bad.

2679
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:23,440
Guys, this is bad.

2680
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:24,840
I didn't realize.

2681
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:27,780
I didn't realize.

2682
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:29,380
That they're there.

2683
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,240
Okay, this is faster.

2684
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,600
Like, actually.

2685
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,200
Wait.

2686
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:41,800
Okay.

2687
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:46,140
Okay.

2688
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:48,340
Okay, nice nade.

2689
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,320
Nice nade.

2690
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,480
I didn't think I'd hit those.

2691
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:58,200
Alright.

2692
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,820
There's so many of them.

2693
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:13,950
Get out of here!

2694
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:16,090
Leave!

2695
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:18,810
Oh my god.

2696
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:19,990
How did the flood lose to them?

2697
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:22,270
How did the flood lose to these guys?

2698
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:26,150
Oh my god.

2699
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:31,730
I can't believe the flood lost to them.

2700
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:33,450
I can't believe it.

2701
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:37,490
Oh my god.

2702
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:39,090
Okay.

2703
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:40,670
Okay, this is fine.

2704
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:44,090
This is fine.

2705
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:48,350
We'll just slowly go in.

2706
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:05,200
this

2707
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:10,850
is fine.

2708
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:14,490
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

2709
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:30,380

2710
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:33,320
He is not okay right now.

2711
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:42,060
I am NOT okay are you fucking kidding me oh my god noooo

2712
01:50:48,570 --> 01:51:13,210

01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:15,070
we made it, we actually made it.

2714
01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:18,150
Holy shit.

2715
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:20,070
I don't know how.

2716
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:23,090
Oh, no.

2717
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:25,470
I don't have ammo anymore.

2718
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:27,110
Oh, no.

2719
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:30,410
Oh, this is so bad.

2720
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:36,160
This is so bad.

2721
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,700
This is so bad.

2722
01:51:45,310 --> 01:51:46,090
Okay.

2723
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:49,630
I don't!

2724
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:50,970
I have one bullet!

2725
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:54,310
There you go.

2726
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:55,170
There you go.

2727
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:55,850
Are you happy?

2728
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:56,990
Are you happy?

2729
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:04,690
Last thing, thank you for the super chat.

2730
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:05,490
Thank you.

2731
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:07,470
Thank you.

2732
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:09,910
Oh, use the blast!

2733
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:12,010
Oh, my one fucking bullet!

2734
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:12,470
What?!

2735
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:21,810
Cindy, thank you for the super chat.

2736
01:52:21,890 --> 01:52:22,110
Thank you.

2737
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:22,730
Thank you.

2738
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:25,390
I cannot believe she fumbled in a Banshee.

2739
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:26,910
Air superiority!

2740
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:30,210
My Banshee was 2 HP!

2741
01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:32,530
I don't know what you want from me!

2742
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:33,410
I...

2743
01:52:33,410 --> 01:52:38,970
Oh, my God.

2744
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:42,410
John Halo is not John-ing... not Halo-ing very well.

2745
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:51,600
Oh, my God.

2746
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:52,400
Did he TP me?

2747
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:58,500
Oh, my God.

2748
01:52:58,580 --> 01:52:59,140
I did it.

2749
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:02,040
Oh, my God.

2750
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:02,720
I did it.

2751
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:13,300
Oh, my God.

2752
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:20,900
Oh, my God.

2753
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:24,180
That... that was one level?!

2754
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:25,700
That...

2755
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:26,760
That...

2756
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:26,940
That...

2757
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:31,840
That was two hours!

2758
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:32,660
That was two hours!

2759
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,900
...interference from the cruiser's damaged reactor.

2760
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:36,620
I'll bring us in as close as I can.

2761
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,440
Captain Keys, help me.

2762
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:46,980
I'm like...

2763
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:55,260
Alright...

2764
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,080
Don't worry Keys!

2765
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:01,160
I'm coming!

2766
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:04,060
Oh.

2767
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,360
Hopefully, we needed that, actually.

2768
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:12,340
All right.

2769
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:13,380
We're invisible.

2770
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:17,680
Ha ha ha!

2771
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,140
He doesn't know I'm invisible!

2772
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:22,940
All right.

2773
01:54:26,730 --> 01:54:27,690
Ha ha ha ha!

2774
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:32,150
Okay, I need this gun.

2775
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:33,610
Get me out of here.

2776
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:36,710
Uh...

2777
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:38,210
There you go.

2778
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:39,630
I need... Come on.

2779
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:40,190
Oh, wait!

2780
01:54:40,330 --> 01:54:40,930
Is it full ammo?

2781
01:54:41,110 --> 01:54:41,370
Nice.

2782
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:42,330
Oh, shit!

2783
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:44,130
Get out of here!

2784
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:48,130
Get your ass out of here!

2785
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:51,190
We go this way.

2786
01:54:52,630 --> 01:54:54,290
How the fuck do I get out of here?

2787
01:54:59,450 --> 01:55:00,410
Yeah, what do I do?

2788
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:06,710
Okay, so we have to go a different way.

2789
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:08,810
Yeah, I was gonna say, what the fuck?

2790
01:55:09,850 --> 01:55:10,630
Oh, shit!

2791
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:12,370
What the fuck?

2792
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:13,990
Warning.

2793
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:15,150
Threat level increasing.

2794
01:55:16,130 --> 01:55:16,790
That's fine.

2795
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:18,210
I have nades.

2796
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:18,630
Oh!

2797
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:21,810
That jump into the coolant is looking better all the time.

2798
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:23,890
Yeah, they're jumping.

2799
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:24,250
Okay.

2800
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:27,570
Trust me, it's deep enough to push an hour fall.

2801
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:28,350
Is it?

2802
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:34,570
I could make it!

2803
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:35,710
I thought... Oh, shit!

2804
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:36,210
Oh, no.

2805
01:55:36,370 --> 01:55:36,830
Oh, thank God.

2806
01:55:36,890 --> 01:55:37,290
I was gonna say.

2807
01:55:37,290 --> 01:55:38,630
Oh, my God.

2808
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:39,350
I can't see anything.

2809
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:40,590
Oh, my God!

2810
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:41,170
Please!

2811
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:42,990
We're both not on the same team!

2812
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:46,450
Let's get out of here and find another way back.

2813
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:50,170
Why me?

2814
01:55:54,860 --> 01:55:55,540
Oh, wait.

2815
01:55:56,060 --> 01:55:56,620
It's time.

2816
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:58,200
Oh, I can see now.

2817
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:01,640
Okay.

2818
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:02,200
Okay.

2819
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:02,300
All right.

2820
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:03,080
Now, it's fine.

2821
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:03,540
It's fine.

2822
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:04,800
I can see though.

2823
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:07,920
Okay, guys.

2824
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:08,460
Give me a sec.

2825
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:09,740
I need to be able to see.

2826
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:11,340
Give me a sec.

2827
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:13,700
Let me see for like one second.

2828
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,020
And then...

2829
01:56:18,870 --> 01:56:19,270
Okay.

2830
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:21,130
Okay.

2831
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,030
Okay, now we can do it.

2832
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:22,870
Now...

2833
01:56:22,870 --> 01:56:24,390
Now we can leave.

2834
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:27,110
I just wanna make sure there's any health packs.

2835
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:30,970
Look, it was very dark.

2836
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:31,350
Okay?

2837
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:32,550
It was...

2838
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:34,930
It was very, very dark.

2839
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,020
All right.

2840
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,740
So unnatural.

2841
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,120
What the fuck?

2842
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,540
Wait, what was the point of here?

2843
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:53,740
What?

2844
01:56:54,860 --> 01:56:56,180
I killed everything.

2845
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:59,380
What would work?

2846
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:00,940
Go here?

2847
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:06,070
What the fuck?

2848
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:08,550
Here?

2849
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:09,790
Oh, it's here.

2850
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:11,350
Okay.

2851
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:12,330
Figure it out.

2852
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:13,790
I got lost.

2853
01:57:13,970 --> 01:57:14,930
Everything looked the same.

2854
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:23,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

2855
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:23,820
That was not...

2856
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:26,000
I didn't mean to do that actually.

2857
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:30,800
That was the one time I did not mean to do that.

2858
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,500
I wanna get rid of this guy first.

2859
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,400
I really can't be bothered.

2860
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:43,280
I know I shouldn't waste my ammo there.

2861
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:45,020
But like, I can't be bothered.

2862
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:47,500
You're so annoying.

2863
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:48,520
You're so annoying!

2864
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,160
Pop!

2865
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:52,240
Okay, here.

2866
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:52,560
Here.

2867
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:53,120
Ah!

2868
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:54,520
Ah!

2869
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,020
I'm sorry!

2870
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,060
I got scared!

2871
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,200
I got scared!

2872
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,880
Sometimes when I'm scared, I press tab.

2873
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:05,660
There you go.

2874
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,560
You're fucking kidding me?

2875
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:11,440
Oh, I'm running out of ammo right now.

2876
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:12,080
I am...

2877
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,020
I am running out of a lot of ammo.

2878
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:18,840
I think the worst part is just the...

2879
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:23,170
Oh, I don't...

2880
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:34,900
Okay.

2881
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:35,940
That's fine.

2882
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:40,650
Oh my god.

2883
01:58:40,950 --> 01:58:42,130
Your mom doesn't love you.

2884
01:58:45,170 --> 01:58:46,250
Give me that pistol.

2885
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:50,310
Get out of here.

2886
01:58:51,890 --> 01:58:52,310
Pop!

2887
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:57,020
Alright, let's see.

2888
01:58:58,720 --> 01:58:59,780
There we go.

2889
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:01,740
They just...

2890
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:03,440
Oh my god, they're endless.

2891
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:05,540
I just realized they're endless.

2892
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:07,860
Oh my god.

2893
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:09,340
They'll keep coming.

2894
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:14,560
Oh my god!

2895
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:18,700
Fuck it.

2896
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:21,220
That's actually not fair.

2897
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:23,860
That was actually not fair.

2898
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:31,210
Alright.

2899
01:59:32,430 --> 01:59:34,450
Like, they made no sound at all!

2900
01:59:34,730 --> 01:59:35,810
They just was like...

2901
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:36,250
Peekaboo!

2902
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:37,510
We should head this way.

2903
01:59:37,650 --> 01:59:38,710
To force the ship's gravity.

2904
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:40,410
AHHHHH!

2905
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:47,900
I swear to god.

2906
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:49,320
I will press tap.

2907
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,360
I swear to god.

2908
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:51,440
I...

2909
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,620
I will press tap.

2910
02:00:02,210 --> 02:00:02,890
Actually, no.

2911
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:03,670
I should...

2912
02:00:03,670 --> 02:00:05,210
Like, let them do their own fight.

2913
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:07,630
I can't see nothing.

2914
02:00:11,150 --> 02:00:13,290
The crash did more damage than I suspected.

2915
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:15,790
I'm just gonna...

2916
02:00:15,790 --> 02:00:17,090
I'm letting them deal with this.

2917
02:00:17,230 --> 02:00:18,630
I'm just gonna let them deal with this.

2918
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:21,590
No, it's fine.

2919
02:00:21,710 --> 02:00:22,870
I'm gonna let them fight this.

2920
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:28,250
Like, fuck this.

2921
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:29,630
I'm gonna let them fight.

2922
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:34,980
What?

2923
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:35,540
What does this look like?

2924
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:36,240
Oh my god.

2925
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:36,800
I can...

2926
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:37,600
Oh my god.

2927
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,300
This is forever.

2928
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:42,680
Are they still alive?

2929
02:00:48,090 --> 02:00:48,930
Is this...

2930
02:00:48,930 --> 02:00:49,790
Is this endless?

2931
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:51,170
Will the hunters live forever?

2932
02:00:52,010 --> 02:00:52,990
There's no way.

2933
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:53,830
AHHHHH!

2934
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:57,770
I just wanted to kill the hunters.

2935
02:00:57,990 --> 02:00:58,450
That's all.

2936
02:00:58,730 --> 02:00:59,590
No, there's no way.

2937
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:00,370
See, I told you.

2938
02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:01,730
Oh my god.

2939
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:03,010
He's still trying to kill me.

2940
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:04,670
He's still trying to kill me.

2941
02:01:04,670 --> 02:01:05,710
Oh my god.

2942
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:06,670
Like...

2943
02:01:06,670 --> 02:01:07,470
There's...

2944
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:09,270
There's like 200 of them.

2945
02:01:10,910 --> 02:01:11,470
No.

2946
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:12,390
This guy died.

2947
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:13,990
The other one died.

2948
02:01:15,810 --> 02:01:16,910
Are they actually...

2949
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:17,610
No.

2950
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:18,350
See, look at him.

2951
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:20,590
Bro, I'm pretty sure he's dead.

2952
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:21,530
I'm...

2953
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:23,690
I'm pretty sure...

2954
02:01:23,690 --> 02:01:25,070
That guy's dead.

2955
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:29,910
That guy looks so dead.

2956
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:31,570
Like, there's no...

2957
02:01:31,570 --> 02:01:32,810
You guys were like...

2958
02:01:33,850 --> 02:01:34,450
Doki.

2959
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:35,490
What?

2960
02:01:35,890 --> 02:01:37,810
The hunters are immune.

2961
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:38,390
No.

2962
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:40,770
I'm pretty sure they're fucking dead.

2963
02:01:40,990 --> 02:01:41,210
Guys.

2964
02:01:41,710 --> 02:01:42,150
I'm...

2965
02:01:47,430 --> 02:01:49,030
Oh no.

2966
02:01:50,190 --> 02:01:52,150
Guys, there's no more shotgun ammo.

2967
02:01:54,430 --> 02:01:56,430
There's no more shotgun ammo.

2968
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:57,190
I'm scared.

2969
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:01,870
Oh my god.

2970
02:02:01,870 --> 02:02:02,510
Oh!

2971
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,500
I can watch again.

2972
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:09,280
It's okay.

2973
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:09,880
We'll wait.

2974
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:11,460
Oh, we'll wait.

2975
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:16,300
Oh, we'll wait.

2976
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:16,700
Oh, we'll wait.

2977
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:20,580
Oh, we'll wait.

2978
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:24,280
Alright.

2979
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:26,340
We can...

2980
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:26,920
We can wait.

2981
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:27,880
Wait, what the fuck?

2982
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:28,640
You see that guy?

2983
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:30,040
How did he get up here?

2984
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:31,140
Okay.

2985
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:32,520
I'm gonna get this guy off the cliff.

2986
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:39,900
Jesus Christ.

2987
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:40,180
Wait.

2988
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:40,900
I'm gonna...

2989
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:43,000
I'm gonna cause the explosion.

2990
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:44,940
There we go.

2991
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:46,680
Holy shit.

2992
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:49,040
Look at him go.

2993
02:02:55,590 --> 02:02:56,170
Boom!

2994
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:56,370
Boom!

2995
02:02:58,490 --> 02:02:59,950
How is there a guy up here?

2996
02:03:02,830 --> 02:03:04,890
Yeah, but I want the hunters to be dead.

2997
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:09,110
I need the hunters to die first.

2998
02:03:12,980 --> 02:03:13,420
Okay.

2999
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:13,640
Yeah.

3000
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:13,900
No.

3001
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:14,260
He's dead.

3002
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:15,120
Oh my god!

3003
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:15,700
What the fuck?

3004
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:16,380
He climbed up!

3005
02:03:17,620 --> 02:03:18,760
Oh my god.

3006
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:22,480
Oh my god.

3007
02:03:39,930 --> 02:03:41,250
Oh my god.

3008
02:03:43,870 --> 02:03:44,590
Just in case.

3009
02:03:45,010 --> 02:03:46,190
Just in case.

3010
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:51,370
Okay.

3011
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:52,590
I just wanna be sure.

3012
02:03:57,580 --> 02:03:58,380
Okay.

3013
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:00,300
There we go.

3014
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:01,840
There we go.

3015
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,820
I know you're still people there.

3016
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:09,160
Just in case.

3017
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,660
I just wanna be sure.

3018
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,320
Okay.

3019
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:20,320
Okay, checkpoint done.

3020
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:21,360
Okay, thank god.

3021
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:24,840
Okay.

3022
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:25,960
Alright.

3023
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:31,520
My god.

3024
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:32,480
I knew it.

3025
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:35,000
I fucking knew it.

3026
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:37,360
I knew there's always one more.

3027
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:41,320
There's always one more.

3028
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:46,440
I knew.

3029
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:49,200
I knew there was one more.

3030
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:57,210
Oh my god.

3031
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:01,050
Okay.

3032
02:05:02,170 --> 02:05:03,150
There we go.

3033
02:05:06,570 --> 02:05:07,770
Jesus Christ.

3034
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:10,850
Jesus Christ.

3035
02:05:12,970 --> 02:05:13,610
Hello?

3036
02:05:20,210 --> 02:05:20,550
Alright.

3037
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:21,570
Hello?

3038
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:26,010
Oh my god.

3039
02:05:26,570 --> 02:05:27,590
What is this?

3040
02:05:27,810 --> 02:05:29,230
What is this music?

3041
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:34,950
Oh, I don't like this song.

3042
02:05:35,290 --> 02:05:37,570
Oh, I def- I don't like this song.

3043
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:41,730
This song is too scary.

3044
02:05:44,030 --> 02:05:45,610
Too freaky for me.

3045
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:50,170
Too scary for me.

3046
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:55,680
Too scary for me.

3047
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:55,700
Okay.

3048
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:57,660
Too spooky.

3049
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:01,740
Oh.

3050
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:04,640
The scary violin.

3051
02:06:07,580 --> 02:06:09,520
Not the violin.

3052
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:12,240
Oh.

3053
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:15,940
That's what you know is aliens.

3054
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:20,940
Okay.

3055
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:30,380
Okay.

3056
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:35,580
Hold your position until the lift activates.

3057
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:36,580
Whoa.

3058
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:46,030
Holy shit.

3059
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:46,990
Wait.

3060
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:48,710
What the fuck.

3061
02:06:49,370 --> 02:06:50,010
Oh my god.

3062
02:06:50,150 --> 02:06:51,410
Where did he come from?

3063
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:01,120
Like, actually, where did he come from?

3064
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:07,600
Okay.

3065
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:10,740
Did it activate?

3066
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:14,060
I fucking knew it.

3067
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:16,080
I knew you were dead.

3068
02:07:21,190 --> 02:07:22,470
I'm still here.

3069
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:29,600
Okay, we need that, actually.

3070
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:35,270
I gotta climb the pillar?

3071
02:07:39,890 --> 02:07:40,330
Okay.

3072
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:43,610
All right, we gotta climb the...

3073
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:45,990
Oh my god, it's not even usable.

3074
02:07:49,050 --> 02:07:50,090
Okay, here we go.

3075
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:53,930
Oh, I'm dead.

3076
02:07:55,130 --> 02:07:56,170
I'm so dead.

3077
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:58,990
Oh,

3078
02:08:04,290 --> 02:08:04,710
I did it!

3079
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:05,450
Oh, I held it!

3080
02:08:05,550 --> 02:08:05,770
Yay!

3081
02:08:07,830 --> 02:08:09,110
Oh my god, I held it.

3082
02:08:09,170 --> 02:08:09,870
I didn't even realize.

3083
02:08:10,150 --> 02:08:10,450
Oh my god, I held it.

3084
02:08:10,450 --> 02:08:10,450
I didn't even realize.

3085
02:08:10,450 --> 02:08:12,810
I didn't even realize it's been held already.

3086
02:08:14,030 --> 02:08:16,230
I thought I was... I thought it was over.

3087
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:19,010
I thought... I thought it was gonna...

3088
02:08:19,010 --> 02:08:20,490
There was gonna... More people are gonna come up.

3089
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:32,100
Oh my god, get out of here.

3090
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,080
Oh, at least I can see now.

3091
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:35,900
I can actually see.

3092
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:41,340
Hello?

3093
02:08:43,110 --> 02:08:45,260
Oh, that's a lot of dead things.

3094
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:51,440
Oh, that's a lot of dead aliens.

3095
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:55,860
Give me your shotgun.

3096
02:09:00,530 --> 02:09:01,890
Give me your shotgun!

3097
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:06,520
Okay.

3098
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:10,940
Oh, I know I have to go downstairs.

3099
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:12,540
I know.

3100
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:15,420
It's all waiting for me.

3101
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:18,040
Okay, but what's over here, though?

3102
02:09:21,140 --> 02:09:22,140
Oh, just pop.

3103
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:26,500
Okay, but what's over here?

3104
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:29,720
Oh, shit!

3105
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:30,340
Shotgun!

3106
02:09:32,420 --> 02:09:33,500
That's what's over here.

3107
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:35,040
Oh, fuck!

3108
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:35,880
More shotgun.

3109
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:36,900
That's okay.

3110
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:45,280
Okay, maybe I'm gonna go the other side.

3111
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:45,880
Just in case.

3112
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,220
Just in case.

3113
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:51,320
Okay, that was nothing.

3114
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:52,600
I thought...

3115
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:54,560
I literally thought that was where I should have gone.

3116
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:56,780
Alright, that's fine.

3117
02:09:57,620 --> 02:09:59,080
At least I got shotgun.

3118
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:08,040
Actually, I am not letting these take my overshield.

3119
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:11,060
Okay.

3120
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:13,560
Just gotta be sure.

3121
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:15,120
What?!

3122
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:17,620
Oh my god, they...

3123
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:23,080
Stop!

3124
02:10:28,350 --> 02:10:30,110
Oh my god, it's never ending.

3125
02:10:30,390 --> 02:10:32,790
I didn't realize that was never ending.

3126
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,630
I thought it would end.

3127
02:10:35,470 --> 02:10:37,750
Oh, I wasted my overshield.

3128
02:10:39,590 --> 02:10:41,450
Okay, sometimes they just stop.

3129
02:10:42,330 --> 02:10:43,830
Sometimes they have stopped.

3130
02:10:46,650 --> 02:10:48,230
How was I supposed to know?

3131
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:51,170
This was one of those times that they don't stop.

3132
02:10:57,010 --> 02:10:57,610
Okay.

3133
02:11:01,650 --> 02:11:02,190
Okay.

3134
02:11:02,210 --> 02:11:02,750
No!

3135
02:11:03,110 --> 02:11:04,270
You fucking bitch!

3136
02:11:04,530 --> 02:11:05,270
Oh, thank god.

3137
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:06,310
Oh, thank god.

3138
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:13,600
Okay, I just really need them to not go up to me.

3139
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:18,800
Okay.

3140
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:20,680
It's fine.

3141
02:11:27,390 --> 02:11:27,930
Hello?

3142
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:32,300
What?

3143
02:11:33,220 --> 02:11:33,740
Oh..

3144
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:35,420
Oh my...

3145
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:36,780
OH MY GOD!

3146
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,220
I deserve that.

3147
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:52,140
I deserve that.

3148
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:53,360
I deserve that.

3149
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:55,240
I deserve dying to that.

3150
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:05,480
That was honestly... no, no, I... I 100% deserve that.

3151
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:21,660
At least... at least... Oh, thank god.

3152
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:22,620
You know, that's fine.

3153
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:23,360
I'll take that.

3154
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:24,540
I'll take those.

3155
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:25,620
Is it here?

3156
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:26,860
No, okay.

3157
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:27,960
I have to go... okay, that's good.

3158
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:28,500
That's good.

3159
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,480
I still have my overshield.

3160
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:30,400
That's good.

3161
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:31,440
That's good.

3162
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:32,260
That's good.

3163
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:33,120
That's good.

3164
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:34,920
That's good.

3165
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:35,080
That's good.

3166
02:12:40,740 --> 02:12:41,760
And then we just go down.

3167
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:49,160
Oh my god.

3168
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:49,960
What the fuck?

3169
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:51,400
My mouse bugged out there.

3170
02:12:57,150 --> 02:12:57,810
Oh my god.

3171
02:12:57,950 --> 02:12:59,070
I forgot about these guys.

3172
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:05,560
Okay.

3173
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:07,840
Alright, that's fine.

3174
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:15,280
Okay.

3175
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:22,300
Jesus Christ, I'm stuck in the corner!

3176
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:24,560
Oh my God!

3177
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:35,290
Oh my God, how are you still alive?

3178
02:13:37,730 --> 02:13:44,750
Okay, okay, let's just make sure... we kill them first.

3179
02:13:48,710 --> 02:13:51,210
Okay, and then just to be sure...

3180
02:13:58,210 --> 02:13:58,730
Okay.

3181
02:13:58,730 --> 02:13:59,910
I fucking knew it.

3182
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:02,790
I knew it.

3183
02:14:02,930 --> 02:14:04,530
I knew your asses were there.

3184
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:08,690
Oh my God, you're still alive.

3185
02:14:13,010 --> 02:14:13,530
Okay.

3186
02:14:19,200 --> 02:14:19,880
That's fine.

3187
02:14:23,930 --> 02:14:24,670
That's fine.

3188
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:26,030
I can recharge.

3189
02:14:28,030 --> 02:14:29,510
I'll recharge my shield.

3190
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:34,360
Oh, okay.

3191
02:14:37,740 --> 02:14:38,660
There you go.

3192
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:42,480
There you go.

3193
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:46,380
Okay, worth.

3194
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:48,660
That's what I got!

3195
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:49,180
Run!

3196
02:14:49,580 --> 02:14:50,060
Run!

3197
02:14:54,910 --> 02:14:56,410
Get your ass out of here!

3198
02:14:57,450 --> 02:14:58,430
Okay, nice.

3199
02:15:01,250 --> 02:15:01,950
All right.

3200
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:07,740
Okay.

3201
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:08,100
Oh, shit!

3202
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:09,520
Oh, sh... wait!

3203
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,680
What?!

3204
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:13,300
They came by... Okay, that's cheating!

3205
02:15:13,540 --> 02:15:14,220
That's cheating!

3206
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:15,700
Oh my God!

3207
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:19,780
That's actually not fair!

3208
02:15:20,180 --> 02:15:22,000
That's actually... they came right behind me!

3209
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:22,980
They flanked me!

3210
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:25,300
I wasn't ready for the flank!

3211
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,620
I was not ready for the flank!

3212
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:34,440
I was not ready for the flank!

3213
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:34,980
Oh, whoops.

3214
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:36,120
I mean, that's fine.

3215
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:37,340
What the fuck?!

3216
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:38,900
They did it again?!

3217
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:43,640
Oh no.

3218
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:45,560
Oh my God.

3219
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:47,420
We

3220
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:54,380
should be able to reach the control room on the third level.

3221
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:58,120
Please tell me there's a checkpoint done.

3222
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:07,360
Oh my god.

3223
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:09,220
Oh my god, please.

3224
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:11,520
Please tell me there's a checkpoint done.

3225
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,040
Okay.

3226
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:24,060
Oh my god.

3227
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:25,340
No, not the hunter!

3228
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:30,840
Not- Okay, we gotta- No, no, no!

3229
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:32,660
I don't- I don't have a pistol!

3230
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:34,140
I don't have a pistol!

3231
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:35,480
I don't have-

3232
02:16:38,850 --> 02:16:39,870
Oh no.

3233
02:16:40,370 --> 02:16:41,210
Oh no.

3234
02:16:45,350 --> 02:16:46,670
I don't have a pistol.

3235
02:16:47,090 --> 02:16:48,050
Oh, thank god.

3236
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:49,070
Oh, it doesn't matter.

3237
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:55,280
Oh, it doesn't matter.

3238
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:55,920
Thank god.

3239
02:16:56,620 --> 02:16:57,440
Please tell me.

3240
02:16:58,060 --> 02:16:59,660
I don't know where to go.

3241
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:02,060
I don't know where to go.

3242
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:06,240
Oh my god, you guys were a dead end?

3243
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:15,900
Oh, thank god.

3244
02:17:16,220 --> 02:17:16,840
Thank god.

3245
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:17,140
Fight.

3246
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:17,820
Fight.

3247
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:19,060
Fight.

3248
02:17:22,610 --> 02:17:23,250
That's good.

3249
02:17:23,730 --> 02:17:23,850
Fight!

3250
02:17:23,970 --> 02:17:24,330
Keep fighting!

3251
02:17:24,670 --> 02:17:25,270
Keep fighting!

3252
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:28,230
Oh, it's over.

3253
02:17:28,410 --> 02:17:29,070
Oh, it's over.

3254
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:31,230
It's over.

3255
02:17:32,970 --> 02:17:33,810
Okay.

3256
02:17:34,170 --> 02:17:34,850
That's fine.

3257
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:39,090
That's good.

3258
02:17:39,390 --> 02:17:39,790
Okay.

3259
02:17:41,290 --> 02:17:42,950
At least they fought.

3260
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:48,020
Oh.

3261
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:49,480
Okay.

3262
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:49,500
Okay.

3263
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:51,060
We made it.

3264
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:52,460
We made it.

3265
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:52,840
We made it downstairs.

3266
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:00,860
Oh my god.

3267
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:01,620
I don't know what to do.

3268
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:04,040
I don't know what to do with them upstairs.

3269
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:06,700
How do I get them off?

3270
02:18:08,180 --> 02:18:08,980
Wrong way!

3271
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:09,680
Okay.

3272
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:12,280
I'm lost.

3273
02:18:14,460 --> 02:18:15,580
I'm so lost.

3274
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:17,820
I'm actually so lost.

3275
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:21,640
What way do I have to go?

3276
02:18:25,910 --> 02:18:27,130
Okay, this way.

3277
02:18:27,990 --> 02:18:29,830
But I fought so many!

3278
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:35,660
I fought so many, though.

3279
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:44,780
I'm just gonna make sure these guys don't bother me.

3280
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:50,220
Are you jiggle peeking?

3281
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:52,080
Oh.

3282
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:54,040
I'm healing my shields?

3283
02:18:57,660 --> 02:18:58,640
Oh, there we go.

3284
02:18:58,760 --> 02:18:59,440
Oh, shit!

3285
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:05,450
Hello.

3286
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:11,220
Are you serious?

3287
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:12,380
I don't...

3288
02:19:12,380 --> 02:19:13,340
Okay, he's off.

3289
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:15,040
Alright, I need your gun.

3290
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:17,840
Fuck.

3291
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:18,860
Oh.

3292
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:19,720
Is that your gun?

3293
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:21,120
Oh my god.

3294
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:21,960
Please!

3295
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:22,520
Please!

3296
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:23,640
I need your gun!

3297
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:26,600
No!

3298
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,660
I wasted so much ammo!

3299
02:19:30,820 --> 02:19:31,300
Oh my god.

3300
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:32,760
Okay, I got your gun.

3301
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:33,820
Got your gun!

3302
02:19:33,820 --> 02:19:34,440
He he.

3303
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:38,920
Alright, up we go.

3304
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:41,380
Up we go.

3305
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:45,460
Why are you...

3306
02:19:45,460 --> 02:19:46,120
Oh my god.

3307
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:47,560
They're running away from the flood.

3308
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:50,100
Oh my god.

3309
02:19:50,260 --> 02:19:51,000
They're so pathetic.

3310
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:56,680
They're actually so pathetic.

3311
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:58,060
TURN AROUND!

3312
02:19:58,060 --> 02:19:58,780
TURN AROUND!

3313
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:04,160
Turn your ass around!

3314
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:11,220
Okay.

3315
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:15,800
Oh my god.

3316
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:16,860
You grunts.

3317
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:19,400
Get this way.

3318
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:22,740
Fucking knew it.

3319
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:23,460
I heard you.

3320
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:27,240
I knew it!

3321
02:20:28,180 --> 02:20:29,340
I knew you were there!

3322
02:20:34,270 --> 02:20:34,750
Okay.

3323
02:20:37,690 --> 02:20:38,290
Oh wait.

3324
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:38,870
He has a shotgun.

3325
02:20:39,270 --> 02:20:39,730
I need that.

3326
02:20:40,790 --> 02:20:41,510
Fucking idiot.

3327
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:42,790
I knew you were gonna turn around.

3328
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:49,620
I'm so healthy!

3329
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:56,100
I feel so healthy!

3330
02:20:58,980 --> 02:21:00,100
Why is there a ship?

3331
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:03,700
Oh my god.

3332
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:05,040
Why do I hit your ship?

3333
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:07,020
Is that my ship?

3334
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:09,140
Te-teammates?

3335
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:10,420
Team?

3336
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:14,080
Is that...

3337
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:15,020
Friends?

3338
02:21:19,190 --> 02:21:21,130
I don't know if that was friends or not.

3339
02:21:21,310 --> 02:21:22,250
I can't tell.

3340
02:21:23,190 --> 02:21:24,030
Wait what?

3341
02:21:24,290 --> 02:21:24,930
Oh I...

3342
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:28,790
I can't tell if they're friends.

3343
02:21:29,550 --> 02:21:30,470
What the fuck?

3344
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:31,390
He just walks up!

3345
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:35,780
Friend?

3346
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:39,140
Any...

3347
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:40,200
Amigos?

3348
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:45,980
Captain.

3349
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:47,820
Sorry!

3350
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:54,760
Okay!

3351
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:55,860
Look Cortana!

3352
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:58,780
I am going through a lot right now Cortana!

3353
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:00,480
Like...

3354
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:01,820
I am trying!

3355
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:04,640
Please!

3356
02:22:05,180 --> 02:22:07,080
There's so many of them!

3357
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:12,920
Alright.

3358
02:22:19,900 --> 02:22:20,500
Alright.

3359
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:24,060
We go left or forward?

3360
02:22:28,290 --> 02:22:29,790
I think here, maybe?

3361
02:22:30,770 --> 02:22:32,710
There's no more arrows, so I can't tell.

3362
02:22:34,850 --> 02:22:36,530
Oh yeah, we're definitely going there.

3363
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:38,390
Okay.

3364
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:40,390
Alright, that's good to know.

3365
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:42,930
Jesus Christ!

3366
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:43,690
There's so many!

3367
02:22:43,690 --> 02:22:44,690
Please!

3368
02:22:50,450 --> 02:22:51,610
The elevator keeps opening!

3369
02:22:54,630 --> 02:22:57,270
I got...

3370
02:22:57,270 --> 02:22:59,450
The elevator...

3371
02:22:59,450 --> 02:23:01,170
It keeps opening!

3372
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:05,290
He's?

3373
02:23:06,390 --> 02:23:07,830
Are you in there?

3374
02:23:08,510 --> 02:23:09,930
Oh my god!

3375
02:23:10,390 --> 02:23:11,450
It's Kerrigan!

3376
02:23:12,470 --> 02:23:13,790
Kerrigan?

3377
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:19,560
Oh my god!

3378
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:20,660
Is he gonna be sexy now?

3379
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:27,760
Oh, he...

3380
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:30,140
Oh...

3381
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:32,920
Oh...

3382
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:34,040
Oh, that's not sexy.

3383
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:39,640
Oh...

3384
02:23:43,820 --> 02:23:45,220
We gotta end it.

3385
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:46,500
End his misery.

3386
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:52,240
Oh...

3387
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:54,840
Oh my god!

3388
02:23:54,980 --> 02:23:55,400
His head!

3389
02:23:58,560 --> 02:23:59,580
It's still breathing!

3390
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:00,700
He's still alive, guys!

3391
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:02,460
He's still breathing!

3392
02:24:02,980 --> 02:24:03,720
Don't you hear that?

3393
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:04,860
Oh my god!

3394
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:05,520
I like...

3395
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:06,820
Punched his face in...

3396
02:24:06,820 --> 02:24:07,620
Oh shit!

3397
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:09,420
Whoops!

3398
02:24:09,740 --> 02:24:10,840
I got a little too distracted.

3399
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:16,540
Jesus Christ!

3400
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:20,320
Okay.

3401
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:22,800
Okay, give me a sec!

3402
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:28,660
Oh my god.

3403
02:24:29,180 --> 02:24:30,000
I need to re...

3404
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,660
I need to heal my shield real quick too.

3405
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:33,500
Alright.

3406
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:37,120
The Flood did not like that.

3407
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:38,740
No, they definitely did not.

3408
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:41,080
They were really angry with me with that.

3409
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:43,700
What the fuck?

3410
02:24:43,700 --> 02:24:44,720
He's just standing there.

3411
02:24:46,580 --> 02:24:47,700
Alright, get out.

3412
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:50,360
Oh!

3413
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:51,520
Oh!

3414
02:24:57,170 --> 02:24:58,750
Okay, I did not expect that.

3415
02:24:59,050 --> 02:25:01,030
I actually did not expect that.

3416
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:06,140
Oh my god.

3417
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:06,400
Please.

3418
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:08,020
I have so many things to deal with.

3419
02:25:12,030 --> 02:25:12,830
Oh my god.

3420
02:25:14,550 --> 02:25:14,910
Okay.

3421
02:25:16,430 --> 02:25:17,010
Oh my god.

3422
02:25:17,130 --> 02:25:17,870
To recharge my shields.

3423
02:25:18,310 --> 02:25:18,670
No!

3424
02:25:18,950 --> 02:25:19,030
No!

3425
02:25:19,150 --> 02:25:19,730
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3426
02:25:23,090 --> 02:25:24,910
We need to get back to the Pillar of Autumn.

3427
02:25:25,410 --> 02:25:27,310
Go back to the Shuttleway and find your ride.

3428
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:30,970
That's...

3429
02:25:31,450 --> 02:25:31,770
Fucked up.

3430
02:25:34,810 --> 02:25:36,090
That's so fucked up.

3431
02:25:37,730 --> 02:25:39,030
That's so fucked up.

3432
02:25:42,270 --> 02:25:43,910
That's actually so messed up.

3433
02:25:44,790 --> 02:25:46,010
That's messed up, buddy.

3434
02:25:47,870 --> 02:25:49,150
I need your but...

3435
02:25:49,150 --> 02:25:50,290
I need your buddy, friend.

3436
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:51,710
Oh my god.

3437
02:25:51,770 --> 02:25:52,530
How am I doing worse?

3438
02:25:53,050 --> 02:25:53,890
How am I actually...

3439
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:54,330
Oh my...

3440
02:25:54,330 --> 02:25:54,850
Just end me.

3441
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:55,870
Just end me.

3442
02:25:57,010 --> 02:25:58,090
Just end me.

3443
02:26:00,410 --> 02:26:02,230
Just get me out of here.

3444
02:26:03,750 --> 02:26:05,990
Wait, maybe if I... I know.

3445
02:26:08,090 --> 02:26:08,930
Fight each other.

3446
02:26:09,130 --> 02:26:09,770
Fight each other.

3447
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:11,130
Fight each other.

3448
02:26:11,330 --> 02:26:11,770
Yes!

3449
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:13,730
Oh, I'm so smart!

3450
02:26:14,090 --> 02:26:14,870
Oh, shit!

3451
02:26:21,580 --> 02:26:22,380
There we go.

3452
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:24,760
I can sit here.

3453
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:28,280
That's right!

3454
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:30,260
Entertainment!

3455
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:30,460
Me!

3456
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:32,760
Don't worry.

3457
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:34,580
I'll come in a third party later.

3458
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:38,940
That's lucky, right?

3459
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:39,940
Don't worry.

3460
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:41,240
I'm here in a third party.

3461
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:43,140
Oh, shit.

3462
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:43,440
Wait.

3463
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:43,880
Wait.

3464
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:44,580
I think they won.

3465
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:46,280
I think they won.

3466
02:26:48,480 --> 02:26:49,000
Oh, yeah.

3467
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:49,140
No.

3468
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:49,880
They definitely won.

3469
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:51,820
They definitely won.

3470
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:55,600
Alright.

3471
02:26:56,540 --> 02:26:57,360
Let's go through.

3472
02:26:57,360 --> 02:26:57,380
Let's go through.

3473
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:01,140
Nice.

3474
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:05,200
That's good.

3475
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:07,400
Here?

3476
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:11,920
Do I go all the way back?

3477
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:14,740
I'm so lost.

3478
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:18,180
Do I backtrack?

3479
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:23,800
Oh, back where I came from.

3480
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:24,120
Okay.

3481
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:24,920
Okay.

3482
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:25,480
Back here.

3483
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:27,480
This is where I came from.

3484
02:27:29,940 --> 02:27:31,100
And then I came here.

3485
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:31,880
Oh, there you go.

3486
02:27:31,940 --> 02:27:32,860
I figured it out, guys.

3487
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:34,560
I did it.

3488
02:27:41,870 --> 02:27:42,370
Okay.

3489
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:45,610
God, these guys... Oh, I'm just gonna let them pop.

3490
02:27:46,070 --> 02:27:47,150
They're so annoying.

3491
02:27:50,030 --> 02:27:51,610
They're actually so annoying.

3492
02:27:56,600 --> 02:27:57,700
Oh, my God.

3493
02:27:57,800 --> 02:28:01,760
They took my fucking... Oh, my God.

3494
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:02,300
Really?

3495
02:28:05,180 --> 02:28:06,400
I didn't see the name.

3496
02:28:06,480 --> 02:28:07,740
I didn't see the name.

3497
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:10,980
I didn't see the name.

3498
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:11,380
I didn't see the name.

3499
02:28:14,860 --> 02:28:16,840
Oh, my God.

3500
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:20,320
I actually... I didn't see it.

3501
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:27,120
Oh, my God.

3502
02:28:36,670 --> 02:28:37,910
I swear to God.

3503
02:28:38,310 --> 02:28:39,210
I swear to God.

3504
02:28:39,210 --> 02:28:42,170
I... If it hits me again.

3505
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:47,510
I swear to fucking God.

3506
02:28:48,610 --> 02:28:49,590
Oh, my God.

3507
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:50,210
I learned my lesson.

3508
02:28:50,350 --> 02:28:51,210
I learned my lesson.

3509
02:28:51,610 --> 02:28:52,730
I learned my lesson.

3510
02:28:52,910 --> 02:28:54,050
I heard... I saw the wind-up.

3511
02:28:54,190 --> 02:28:55,530
I saw the wind-up.

3512
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:01,410
I saw that wind-up.

3513
02:29:03,330 --> 02:29:04,390
What the fuck?

3514
02:29:08,430 --> 02:29:09,670
Oh, my God.

3515
02:29:12,650 --> 02:29:13,570
That's right.

3516
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:15,050
Oh my god.

3517
02:29:15,110 --> 02:29:15,910
Oh my god.

3518
02:29:15,910 --> 02:29:17,250
He's a fucking baseball player.

3519
02:29:20,790 --> 02:29:22,010
Holy shit.

3520
02:29:22,190 --> 02:29:22,690
He's gaming.

3521
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:35,280
Are you serious?

3522
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:36,820
You're still here?

3523
02:29:37,460 --> 02:29:39,840
Are you fucking... I hate you.

3524
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:41,080
I hate you.

3525
02:29:43,180 --> 02:29:44,560
I hate you.

3526
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:45,280
I hate you.

3527
02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:50,340
Oh my... Get out of here.

3528
02:29:58,660 --> 02:29:59,900
Oh my god.

3529
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:00,540
I hate him.

3530
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:08,140
Holy shit.

3531
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:09,700
Oh my god.

3532
02:30:14,390 --> 02:30:16,470
Bro, they're actual baseball players.

3533
02:30:16,610 --> 02:30:18,550
Like, somebody draft him right now.

3534
02:30:19,050 --> 02:30:19,350
What?

3535
02:30:20,590 --> 02:30:22,590
Someone actually draft this man.

3536
02:30:26,350 --> 02:30:27,890
Oh my god.

3537
02:30:28,070 --> 02:30:28,950
You fuckers.

3538
02:30:39,330 --> 02:30:40,870
They must get on you.

3539
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:44,430
Okay.

3540
02:30:47,150 --> 02:30:48,630
I swear to god.

3541
02:30:48,910 --> 02:30:50,470
I swear to god.

3542
02:30:53,210 --> 02:30:54,130
Where are you?

3543
02:30:54,270 --> 02:30:55,490
I know you're alive.

3544
02:30:56,150 --> 02:30:57,050
Where are you?

3545
02:30:57,410 --> 02:30:59,050
It's gonna find you.

3546
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:02,590
I told I was close.

3547
02:31:03,030 --> 02:31:04,390
Oh, that was so close.

3548
02:31:04,590 --> 02:31:06,230
Oh, you almost got me.

3549
02:31:07,610 --> 02:31:09,150
You almost did it.

3550
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:16,220
That was a little too close for comfort.

3551
02:31:16,300 --> 02:31:16,840
No, it was.

3552
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:19,420
It was 100% too close for comfort.

3553
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:24,360
Is he dead?

3554
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,360
Okay, thank god.

3555
02:31:30,910 --> 02:31:32,030
Oh, thank god.

3556
02:31:35,090 --> 02:31:36,190
Where do I...

3557
02:31:37,610 --> 02:31:39,430
Oh, I have to go all the way down.

3558
02:31:39,730 --> 02:31:40,350
Don't I?

3559
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:42,890
Oh, how do I get down?

3560
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:44,430
How do I...

3561
02:31:49,270 --> 02:31:50,890
Wait, can I jump here?

3562
02:31:51,310 --> 02:31:52,570
Can I jump on that ship?

3563
02:31:52,750 --> 02:31:53,990
I can jump down?

3564
02:31:57,650 --> 02:31:58,190
I...

3565
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:02,300
I...

3566
02:32:02,300 --> 02:32:03,280
Okay.

3567
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:06,720
Okay, that was like a little too intense for me.

3568
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:08,340
Oh, yeah.

3569
02:32:24,460 --> 02:32:25,740
I don't know.

3570
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:30,620
I...

3571
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:31,120
I don't...

3572
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:32,260
I don't...

3573
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:39,640
That's it!

3574
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:42,820
Wee...

3575
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:44,460
I can't.

3576
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:46,780
I...

3577
02:32:49,780 --> 02:32:51,180
Wee...

3578
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:52,720
Wee...

3579
02:32:52,720 --> 02:32:54,300
Wee...

3580
02:33:03,390 --> 02:33:06,990
Okay, you guys could have told me that that was the end of the level.

3581
02:33:06,990 --> 02:33:07,830
I would have...

3582
02:33:09,570 --> 02:33:16,130
If I knew that doing that ends the level, I would have done that earlier, chat.

3583
02:33:19,010 --> 02:33:23,090
If I knew that, I would have done that earlier.

3584
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:29,970
I thought... I thought... I don't know.

3585
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:32,530
I thought I'd die if I do it.

3586
02:33:42,260 --> 02:33:43,720
Robin, thank you for the super chat.

3587
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:44,480
Thank you.

3588
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:46,280
He really was a baseball player.

3589
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:48,120
Three strikes and you're out.

3590
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:50,780
Yeah, the Dodgers should have signed this guy up.

3591
02:33:55,340 --> 02:33:56,080
It's okay.

3592
02:33:56,460 --> 02:33:58,280
Captain Fuse will get better, right, guys?

3593
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,120
He'll get better.

3594
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,800
Just a little flesh wound.

3595
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,280
His head can grow back.

3596
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:16,600
Guys, I...

3597
02:34:17,360 --> 02:34:19,440
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

3598
02:34:19,460 --> 02:34:20,140
Did I live?

3599
02:34:20,740 --> 02:34:21,500
Oh, now?

3600
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,760
Oh, so now he lives through explosions.

3601
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:25,500
But all the other times...

3602
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:28,960
It's like credits.

3603
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:33,070
All the other times I don't live, but this time I live...

3604
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:34,940
Alright, I need to use the bathroom.

3605
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:36,060
I'll be right back, guys.

3606
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:36,760
I'm angry.

3607
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:43,020
Wow, I'm back.

3608
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:44,180
Uh...

3609
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:44,420
Min!

3610
02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:45,160
Robin!

3611
02:35:45,940 --> 02:35:46,420
Wyatt!

3612
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:48,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3613
02:35:48,660 --> 02:35:49,140
Uh...

3614
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:49,840
Stick of Butter!

3615
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:50,360
Nexi!

3616
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:51,100
Mike!

3617
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:52,000
Pawn!

3618
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:52,620
Zekra!

3619
02:35:52,780 --> 02:35:53,120
Solid!

3620
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:53,740
Neppers!

3621
02:35:53,900 --> 02:35:54,200
Medi!

3622
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:54,700
Bite!

3623
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:55,560
Bowen!

3624
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:55,900
Alan!

3625
02:35:56,020 --> 02:35:56,920
Thank you for the super chat!

3626
02:35:57,020 --> 02:35:57,260
Thank you!

3627
02:35:57,400 --> 02:35:58,120
Thank you!

3628
02:35:59,160 --> 02:35:59,640
Uh...

3629
02:35:59,640 --> 02:35:59,880
Ping!

3630
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:00,980
Thank you for the super chat!

3631
02:36:01,060 --> 02:36:01,260
Thank you!

3632
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:02,280
Alright, guys.

3633
02:36:02,580 --> 02:36:03,560
I'm gonna order food then.

3634
02:36:03,560 --> 02:36:06,900
If this is the last level, let me order food in advance.

3635
02:36:07,340 --> 02:36:08,600
Okay, ordering food time.

3636
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:09,860
Alright.

3637
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:13,960
It's like when you feed a Haru grass.

3638
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:16,420
What do I want to eat today, though?

3639
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:19,040
I haven't had, like, takeout for a bit.

3640
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:19,900
So I don't know.

3641
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:20,940
Alright, guys.

3642
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:22,120
Uh...

3643
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:22,320
Ooh!

3644
02:36:22,620 --> 02:36:23,220
What's this?

3645
02:36:24,060 --> 02:36:25,280
Have I tried this before?

3646
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:25,740
Ooh!

3647
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:27,180
Truffle?

3648
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,680
That's bougie as fuck!

3649
02:36:29,340 --> 02:36:30,900
Nah, I don't really want Truffle.

3650
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:32,560
Uh...

3651
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:32,700
Ooh!

3652
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:33,660
There's a new place!

3653
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:34,660
Called...

3654
02:36:34,660 --> 02:36:35,440
Wait, why?

3655
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,420
I shouldn't say...

3656
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:37,800
I was like, called?

3657
02:36:38,360 --> 02:36:38,620
Whoa!

3658
02:36:38,860 --> 02:36:41,560
Let me dox myself real quick, sorry!

3659
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:43,920
You don't know what it's called?

3660
02:36:44,180 --> 02:36:45,840
I don't know what it's called, guys.

3661
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:46,900
I...

3662
02:36:53,340 --> 02:36:54,300
Let's see...

3663
02:36:54,300 --> 02:36:55,420
I don't know.

3664
02:36:55,420 --> 02:36:55,560
I don't know.

3665
02:36:55,560 --> 02:36:56,840
I don't know what I want to eat.

3666
02:36:58,320 --> 02:36:58,680
Hmm...

3667
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:01,340
I've had a tie in a long ass time, to be fair.

3668
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:02,600
Uh...

3669
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:02,720
Oh!

3670
02:37:02,820 --> 02:37:03,680
Summer outfit time!

3671
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:04,560
Yeah, I can, Nexy!

3672
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:05,380
Thank you, Super Chat!

3673
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:06,400
Thank you, thank you!

3674
02:37:07,640 --> 02:37:08,000
Um...

3675
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:08,500
Oh, it's...

3676
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:10,520
Oh, yeah, it's time to swap the outfit.

3677
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:12,960
Okay, after I pick my food, guys...

3678
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:13,220
Oh!

3679
02:37:13,380 --> 02:37:14,920
I could get...

3680
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:15,580
Mmm...

3681
02:37:15,580 --> 02:37:16,800
Do I want sushi today?

3682
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:18,860
Mmm...

3683
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:19,580
I could get sushi...

3684
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:20,800
No, I had sushi...

3685
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:22,260
No, I had sushi...

3686
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:25,120
Last time I went out to eat, I had sushi already.

3687
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:26,600
So I should get something different.

3688
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:29,660
Uh...

3689
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:31,060
Mmm...

3690
02:37:31,060 --> 02:37:33,240
I haven't had a tie in a long ass time.

3691
02:37:33,780 --> 02:37:34,240
Maybe?

3692
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:35,840
Let me check.

3693
02:37:36,860 --> 02:37:37,320
Ooh...

3694
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:39,480
Ooh, I could get fried rice.

3695
02:37:41,220 --> 02:37:41,680
Uh...

3696
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:43,640
Oh my gosh, it's so hard to pick, guys.

3697
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:45,440
I'm so hungry.

3698
02:37:45,960 --> 02:37:46,580
Mmm...

3699
02:37:48,340 --> 02:37:48,960
Mmm...

3700
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:50,040
So hungry.

3701
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:52,440
Uh...

3702
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:53,660
Yeah, get day three ready.

3703
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:54,300
Fudge tap.

3704
02:37:54,580 --> 02:37:56,100
You're in a Super Chat!

3705
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:57,160
Thank you, thank you!

3706
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:58,560
Alright, I know what to get.

3707
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:01,880
Alright, I'm gonna get...

3708
02:38:02,680 --> 02:38:03,300
Uh...

3709
02:38:03,300 --> 02:38:03,980
A burger?

3710
02:38:04,300 --> 02:38:05,120
No, no burger.

3711
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:06,260
Not burger.

3712
02:38:06,940 --> 02:38:08,660
I'm gonna get...

3713
02:38:08,660 --> 02:38:09,720
Uh...

3714
02:38:09,720 --> 02:38:12,420
I'm gonna get a Vietnamese place.

3715
02:38:12,420 --> 02:38:13,620
But like, not pho.

3716
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:14,700
Because I don't like...

3717
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:15,420
I personally...

3718
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:16,500
Ooh...

3719
02:38:16,500 --> 02:38:17,360
That one...

3720
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:18,420
Let me add...

3721
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:21,240
Add this to it.

3722
02:38:21,380 --> 02:38:23,700
I personally don't like...

3723
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:24,880
Uh...

3724
02:38:25,220 --> 02:38:26,400
I don't like...

3725
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:27,620
Anything with...

3726
02:38:27,620 --> 02:38:28,620
No, I like pho.

3727
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:30,760
But I don't like takeout pho.

3728
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:31,340
You know?

3729
02:38:32,060 --> 02:38:34,320
I think takeout pho is not as good...

3730
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:35,520
Compared to like...

3731
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:36,420
Eating at the place.

3732
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:39,800
Yeah, I love pho.

3733
02:38:39,940 --> 02:38:41,780
I just don't like doing takeout for it.

3734
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:43,600
Yeah, it's just not the same.

3735
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:47,580
But I do like other Vietnamese cuisines that you can takeout.

3736
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:49,380
So I'm fine with that.

3737
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:50,480
Yeah.

3738
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,240
That's what I mean.

3739
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:56,920
Don't keep fresh grass bun.

3740
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:57,980
I am pho.

3741
02:38:57,980 --> 02:38:59,000
Thank you for the super chat.

3742
02:38:59,160 --> 02:38:59,540
Thank you.

3743
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:00,280
Thank you.

3744
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:03,320
Yeah, I like eating pho at the restaurant.

3745
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:05,780
I don't want to eat it like...

3746
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:08,120
Um...

3747
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:08,320
Um...

3748
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:09,780
I don't want to eat it like...

3749
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:10,620
From takeout.

3750
02:39:10,840 --> 02:39:11,680
It's just not the same.

3751
02:39:13,740 --> 02:39:14,320
Let's see.

3752
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:15,220
What's this?

3753
02:39:17,560 --> 02:39:17,960
Ooh...

3754
02:39:17,960 --> 02:39:19,380
Trying to figure out what to get.

3755
02:39:25,980 --> 02:39:28,880
I should get the...

3756
02:39:31,240 --> 02:39:31,820
Hmm...

3757
02:39:31,820 --> 02:39:33,360
I'm gonna get lychee juice.

3758
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:34,500
I love the...

3759
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:35,500
I love lychee.

3760
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:37,160
I love lychee.

3761
02:39:37,820 --> 02:39:38,280
And I love...

3762
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:39,440
Wait, do you have dragon eye?

3763
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:40,720
Longan?

3764
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:44,180
Oh, they don't have dragon eye.

3765
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:45,440
Um...

3766
02:39:45,440 --> 02:39:46,720
You guys ever want to try like...

3767
02:39:47,340 --> 02:39:47,840
Uh...

3768
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:48,940
An Asian type of fruit?

3769
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:51,020
Dragon eye is so good.

3770
02:39:51,640 --> 02:39:52,360
Or longan.

3771
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:53,700
It's so good.

3772
02:39:57,360 --> 02:39:58,060
It's like...

3773
02:39:58,060 --> 02:39:59,160
It's like really sweet.

3774
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:06,820
Alright, I'm gonna try...

3775
02:40:07,640 --> 02:40:08,260
I'm gonna try...

3776
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:09,040
I never tried this.

3777
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:10,460
It's fried noodles.

3778
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:12,000
I never tried it before.

3779
02:40:12,940 --> 02:40:13,760
Oh, wait.

3780
02:40:14,060 --> 02:40:14,420
What should I do?

3781
02:40:14,540 --> 02:40:15,000
Okay, guys.

3782
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,040
Do I get noodles or...

3783
02:40:16,040 --> 02:40:17,660
Actually, I've been having a lot of noodles.

3784
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:18,720
I'll get fried rice.

3785
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:23,100
Let's see.

3786
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:25,540
Yeah, I'll add this.

3787
02:40:25,900 --> 02:40:27,900
I've been eating a lot of noodles recently.

3788
02:40:28,700 --> 02:40:30,420
No, I never tried durian.

3789
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:34,040
Not really like...

3790
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:36,980
Not really like...

3791
02:40:36,980 --> 02:40:37,560
A huge...

3792
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:40,000
Fan of durian in general.

3793
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:42,440
Or...

3794
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:43,980
I could get...

3795
02:40:45,260 --> 02:40:45,860
Hmm...

3796
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:47,780
Alright.

3797
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:49,240
I ordered what I want.

3798
02:40:49,320 --> 02:40:49,560
I got...

3799
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:50,360
I got fried rice.

3800
02:40:52,980 --> 02:40:53,480
Alright.

3801
02:40:53,540 --> 02:40:54,320
I'm treating myself.

3802
02:40:54,680 --> 02:40:55,400
Treat yourself.

3803
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:56,700
Wait.

3804
02:40:56,820 --> 02:40:57,200
Go back.

3805
02:40:57,520 --> 02:40:57,760
Okay.

3806
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:58,120
Yeah.

3807
02:40:58,180 --> 02:40:59,180
Leave at my door, please.

3808
02:40:59,780 --> 02:41:00,200
Alright.

3809
02:41:01,340 --> 02:41:02,060
I'm ready.

3810
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:03,840
I just ordered food.

3811
02:41:07,970 --> 02:41:08,530
Yeah.

3812
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:11,690
Okay.

3813
02:41:11,750 --> 02:41:12,470
When does it arrive?

3814
02:41:12,930 --> 02:41:13,430
Okay.

3815
02:41:13,790 --> 02:41:14,130
Nice.

3816
02:41:14,610 --> 02:41:14,950
Alright.

3817
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:15,510
It's time.

3818
02:41:16,510 --> 02:41:16,950
It's time.

3819
02:41:17,070 --> 02:41:17,850
The final level.

3820
02:41:21,410 --> 02:41:22,130
Holy shit.

3821
02:41:22,230 --> 02:41:22,750
I can't believe it.

3822
02:41:23,370 --> 02:41:23,650
That...

3823
02:41:23,650 --> 02:41:25,390
The last level was two hours.

3824
02:41:25,510 --> 02:41:27,290
The first level was two hours long.

3825
02:41:27,290 --> 02:41:27,930
Come there.

3826
02:41:28,130 --> 02:41:28,550
We can

3827
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:33,280
eat.

3828
02:41:33,660 --> 02:41:36,640
The explosion should damage enough systems below it to destroy the bridge.

3829
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:37,600
I'm so lost.

3830
02:41:38,220 --> 02:41:39,500
Make your way to the bridge.

3831
02:41:39,800 --> 02:41:40,840
Does anyone have the map?

3832
02:41:41,220 --> 02:41:41,800
Of course.

3833
02:41:42,020 --> 02:41:43,020
Of fucking course.

3834
02:41:45,020 --> 02:41:45,800
Of course.

3835
02:41:49,340 --> 02:41:50,640
Oh, the s- oh wait, sorry.

3836
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:52,360
I forgot about the outfit swap.

3837
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:52,640
Okay.

3838
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:53,160
Give me a sec.

3839
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:54,140
Like...

3840
02:41:54,140 --> 02:41:54,820
Uh...

3841
02:41:54,820 --> 02:41:55,080
Well, no.

3842
02:41:55,160 --> 02:41:55,840
That's the...

3843
02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:57,840
Thank you for reminding me.

3844
02:41:58,060 --> 02:41:59,280
Let me swap real fast.

3845
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:00,580
Alright.

3846
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:02,840
Uh...

3847
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:06,920
I'm going to my claws and changing clothes real quick.

3848
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:13,840
Let me swap my clothes real quick, guys.

3849
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:17,240
Alright.

3850
02:42:18,460 --> 02:42:19,060
Uh...

3851
02:42:19,060 --> 02:42:20,260
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

3852
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:21,880
Oh my god.

3853
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:23,820
My stuff is like all...

3854
02:42:23,820 --> 02:42:24,480
Okay.

3855
02:42:25,060 --> 02:42:26,540
I have to like redo every...

3856
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:27,000
Not...

3857
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:27,080
Okay.

3858
02:42:27,160 --> 02:42:28,460
Not redo everything, but...

3859
02:42:28,900 --> 02:42:29,160
Alright.

3860
02:42:29,320 --> 02:42:29,740
Here we go.

3861
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:32,060
And then...

3862
02:42:32,060 --> 02:42:32,880
Buh buh buh buh.

3863
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:34,560
Let's see.

3864
02:42:36,300 --> 02:42:36,820
Gone.

3865
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:38,460
Alright.

3866
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:40,060
And then...

3867
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:43,080
What's this?

3868
02:42:43,780 --> 02:42:44,200
Okay.

3869
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:45,080
This...

3870
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:45,340
Alright.

3871
02:42:46,480 --> 02:42:47,000
Actually...

3872
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:47,400
No.

3873
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:48,460
I can just take this off.

3874
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:49,720
There we go.

3875
02:42:50,540 --> 02:42:50,660
Alright.

3876
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:52,200
Got my gun out now.

3877
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:53,320
Now.

3878
02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:55,980
I'm ready.

3879
02:42:56,360 --> 02:42:57,180
I have a gun.

3880
02:42:58,340 --> 02:42:58,680
Alright.

3881
02:42:59,080 --> 02:43:00,120
Back from the closet.

3882
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:03,400
Whoops.

3883
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:04,660
Clicked the wrong thing.

3884
02:43:04,820 --> 02:43:05,200
Oh my god.

3885
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:05,920
I'm clicking so many.

3886
02:43:06,020 --> 02:43:07,160
I'm like all over the place.

3887
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:08,240
I'm clicking all...

3888
02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:08,740
Alright.

3889
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:10,460
Now I'm actually locked in.

3890
02:43:10,780 --> 02:43:11,880
I'm locked in now.

3891
02:43:12,940 --> 02:43:13,380
Alright.

3892
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:13,460
Alright.

3893
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:15,100
Alright.

3894
02:43:15,100 --> 02:43:15,140
Okay.

3895
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:16,960
I think they're all done exploding.

3896
02:43:20,610 --> 02:43:21,010
Okay.

3897
02:43:21,090 --> 02:43:21,230
Good.

3898
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:21,770
I was gonna...

3899
02:43:21,770 --> 02:43:22,690
I swear to god.

3900
02:43:22,830 --> 02:43:23,190
If they're...

3901
02:43:23,190 --> 02:43:24,290
I swear to god.

3902
02:43:24,290 --> 02:43:25,710
If they're still exploding, I...

3903
02:43:29,210 --> 02:43:29,610
Okay.

3904
02:43:32,310 --> 02:43:33,130
Get out of here.

3905
02:43:33,710 --> 02:43:35,190
Get your ass out of here!

3906
02:43:36,370 --> 02:43:37,490
That's fucking right!

3907
02:43:37,950 --> 02:43:39,430
I have the gun now!

3908
02:43:40,310 --> 02:43:40,710
Okay.

3909
02:43:40,850 --> 02:43:41,390
I assume it's...

3910
02:43:41,390 --> 02:43:41,530
Okay.

3911
02:43:41,650 --> 02:43:42,130
It's not this way.

3912
02:43:42,350 --> 02:43:42,910
Oh my god.

3913
02:43:42,910 --> 02:43:43,790
Just explode on me.

3914
02:43:43,870 --> 02:43:44,350
I don't care.

3915
02:43:44,350 --> 02:43:44,890
I...

3916
02:43:44,890 --> 02:43:45,590
I don't care.

3917
02:43:46,050 --> 02:43:46,450
Oh shit.

3918
02:43:46,570 --> 02:43:47,550
I care about these guys though.

3919
02:43:48,390 --> 02:43:49,170
Oh my god.

3920
02:43:52,290 --> 02:43:52,850
Okay.

3921
02:43:53,790 --> 02:43:55,550
These guys take forever to die.

3922
02:43:56,150 --> 02:43:56,830
This is bad.

3923
02:43:57,710 --> 02:43:59,050
Oh, I need shotguns.

3924
02:43:59,130 --> 02:44:00,390
Oh, I need shotguns.

3925
02:44:00,990 --> 02:44:01,850
Really badly.

3926
02:44:02,750 --> 02:44:04,370
Oh, where are the shotguns?

3927
02:44:05,290 --> 02:44:05,630
Oh!

3928
02:44:07,070 --> 02:44:07,530
Ah!

3929
02:44:07,930 --> 02:44:09,410
He's jumping to wipe me!

3930
02:44:09,490 --> 02:44:10,010
Okay, it's fine.

3931
02:44:11,290 --> 02:44:12,130
Holy shit.

3932
02:44:12,130 --> 02:44:13,250
The music is so loud.

3933
02:44:13,350 --> 02:44:14,370
Is the music okay?

3934
02:44:14,810 --> 02:44:16,850
Cause it seems really loud on my end.

3935
02:44:17,190 --> 02:44:17,570
I...

3936
02:44:21,930 --> 02:44:22,310
I...

3937
02:44:22,870 --> 02:44:24,130
Okay, you can just explode.

3938
02:44:25,470 --> 02:44:27,270
Yeah, this BGM is loud!

3939
02:44:29,570 --> 02:44:29,950
Okay.

3940
02:44:30,830 --> 02:44:31,810
Okay, it's a bit loud.

3941
02:44:32,030 --> 02:44:33,370
Okay, I'll turn it down a little bit.

3942
02:44:33,530 --> 02:44:34,170
Oh my god.

3943
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:35,310
I'll turn it down a little bit.

3944
02:44:37,170 --> 02:44:38,130
Yeah, audio.

3945
02:44:38,990 --> 02:44:40,030
Is it game music?

3946
02:44:40,210 --> 02:44:40,790
Okay, it was.

3947
02:44:40,790 --> 02:44:41,110
Okay.

3948
02:44:41,150 --> 02:44:42,110
I'll do it 90.

3949
02:44:43,110 --> 02:44:43,630
90.

3950
02:44:44,010 --> 02:44:44,770
There we go.

3951
02:44:50,370 --> 02:44:51,270
Oh my god.

3952
02:44:51,370 --> 02:44:52,670
I don't know if that fixes anything.

3953
02:44:53,170 --> 02:44:53,550
I...

3954
02:44:53,550 --> 02:44:55,390
I don't know.

3955
02:44:55,870 --> 02:44:57,010
Okay, just explode.

3956
02:44:57,130 --> 02:44:57,490
Just pop.

3957
02:44:58,210 --> 02:44:58,650
That's right.

3958
02:44:58,830 --> 02:44:59,370
Very good.

3959
02:44:59,550 --> 02:45:00,610
Are you happy little guy?

3960
02:45:00,930 --> 02:45:01,750
Are you happy?

3961
02:45:02,370 --> 02:45:03,270
Alright, sound guy.

3962
02:45:03,390 --> 02:45:04,010
I know you're here.

3963
02:45:04,790 --> 02:45:06,190
Is the music blow bet...

3964
02:45:06,190 --> 02:45:06,830
Is it better now?

3965
02:45:10,350 --> 02:45:11,030
Alright.

3966
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:15,500
There we go.

3967
02:45:20,900 --> 02:45:21,340
Wait.

3968
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:23,160
I hear him.

3969
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:24,400
I...

3970
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:24,840
I...

3971
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:25,580
I...

3972
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:25,860
I...

3973
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:26,180
I hear him.

3974
02:45:27,980 --> 02:45:28,880
Oh my god.

3975
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:29,620
I hear them.

3976
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:30,460
Oh my god.

3977
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:30,940
Go fight.

3978
02:45:31,140 --> 02:45:31,580
Let's fight.

3979
02:45:31,860 --> 02:45:33,180
Oh my god.

3980
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:39,560
Oh my god.

3981
02:45:39,720 --> 02:45:39,760
Oh my god.

3982
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:40,060
Go fight.

3983
02:45:46,280 --> 02:45:46,760
Woo!

3984
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:54,860
Oh my god.

3985
02:45:55,060 --> 02:45:56,000
That was an accident.

3986
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:00,360
Oh my god.

3987
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:00,680
Oh my god.

3988
02:46:01,720 --> 02:46:02,020
That's fine.

3989
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:02,520
That's fine.

3990
02:46:03,140 --> 02:46:04,520
Oh that is not fine.

3991
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:07,900
That's fine.

3992
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:13,100
Okay.

3993
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:16,220
Okay.

3994
02:46:16,340 --> 02:46:16,660
We're okay.

3995
02:46:17,100 --> 02:46:17,540
We're okay.

3996
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:21,340
I...

3997
02:46:21,900 --> 02:46:23,780
I gave an act...

3998
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:25,200
It's fine.

3999
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:27,120
We gave him a little back shot.

4000
02:46:27,900 --> 02:46:28,480
That's so...

4001
02:46:28,480 --> 02:46:30,000
Oh my god.

4002
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:31,380
I'm not fine anymore.

4003
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:32,300
I'm...

4004
02:46:32,770 --> 02:46:34,920
I'm not fine anymore, guys.

4005
02:46:36,220 --> 02:46:38,740
I am absolutely not fine anymore.

4006
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:39,300
No.

4007
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:40,700
Oh my god.

4008
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:43,640
Oh my god.

4009
02:46:44,580 --> 02:46:45,800
Oh my god.

4010
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:45,860
Oh.

4011
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:47,520
Oh ho ho ho ho.

4012
02:46:49,940 --> 02:46:50,180
Okay.

4013
02:46:50,300 --> 02:46:50,640
There we go.

4014
02:46:50,940 --> 02:46:51,280
There we go.

4015
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:51,880
It's okay.

4016
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:53,640
We killed 50 hunters.

4017
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:54,960
Oh my god.

4018
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:55,620
We did it.

4019
02:46:56,440 --> 02:46:57,700
And we grabbed this too.

4020
02:46:57,980 --> 02:46:58,360
Okay.

4021
02:46:58,440 --> 02:47:00,340
I'll do the music a little less.

4022
02:47:01,580 --> 02:47:02,500
I'll put an 80.

4023
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:04,600
Let me know if it's better, sound guy.

4024
02:47:10,890 --> 02:47:11,410
No.

4025
02:47:11,710 --> 02:47:11,810
No.

4026
02:47:12,070 --> 02:47:12,130
No.

4027
02:47:12,130 --> 02:47:12,450
Don't you...

4028
02:47:12,450 --> 02:47:12,830
Oh my god.

4029
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:13,290
It's him.

4030
02:47:13,590 --> 02:47:14,290
It's baseball man.

4031
02:47:15,110 --> 02:47:16,150
Oh my god.

4032
02:47:17,010 --> 02:47:18,270
Oh my god.

4033
02:47:18,610 --> 02:47:19,010
Oh.

4034
02:47:21,500 --> 02:47:22,020
No.

4035
02:47:22,460 --> 02:47:22,600
No.

4036
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:23,080
No.

4037
02:47:23,260 --> 02:47:24,520
They can't do this to me.

4038
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:25,060
No.

4039
02:47:25,220 --> 02:47:26,940
He can't do this to me.

4040
02:47:31,140 --> 02:47:31,900
He's back.

4041
02:47:34,460 --> 02:47:35,700
He's actually back.

4042
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:35,780
He's back.

4043
02:47:38,320 --> 02:47:40,160
Oh my god.

4044
02:47:42,700 --> 02:47:44,420
Oh my god.

4045
02:47:53,920 --> 02:47:55,140
Oh my god.

4046
02:47:55,260 --> 02:47:55,320
Oh my god.

4047
02:47:55,320 --> 02:47:56,120
This is my checkpoint.

4048
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:57,560
This is my hell.

4049
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:00,860
This is actually my checkpoint.

4050
02:48:00,860 --> 02:48:07,550
Wait, this is... This is my help.

4051
02:48:08,010 --> 02:48:09,270
Holy shit.

4052
02:48:17,770 --> 02:48:19,230
Oh my god.

4053
02:48:23,710 --> 02:48:25,770
Oh my god.

4054
02:48:26,030 --> 02:48:28,230
Oh my god.

4055
02:48:30,420 --> 02:48:32,690
I don't know how I'm gonna survive this.

4056
02:48:32,930 --> 02:48:35,590
Of course this is where it took me.

4057
02:48:43,050 --> 02:48:43,950
Holy shit.

4058
02:48:46,730 --> 02:48:47,250
Okay.

4059
02:48:52,090 --> 02:48:52,610
Alright.

4060
02:48:53,230 --> 02:48:53,970
Last nade.

4061
02:48:55,770 --> 02:48:56,990
Okay, we got him.

4062
02:49:00,130 --> 02:49:00,970
Are you all dead?

4063
02:49:01,870 --> 02:49:03,030
Oh, I see you.

4064
02:49:03,410 --> 02:49:06,230
Oh, you pretend... You put me in a false sense of security.

4065
02:49:06,350 --> 02:49:07,310
You got me out of cover!

4066
02:49:07,630 --> 02:49:08,230
You do!

4067
02:49:11,390 --> 02:49:12,110
Okay.

4068
02:49:12,550 --> 02:49:13,270
Alright.

4069
02:49:13,810 --> 02:49:14,930
I'm so sad.

4070
02:49:15,050 --> 02:49:16,790
I'm so... I'm so sad.

4071
02:49:16,970 --> 02:49:17,970
He baseballed me.

4072
02:49:18,230 --> 02:49:19,510
He baseballed me!

4073
02:49:22,650 --> 02:49:25,450
He actually baseballed me!

4074
02:49:28,590 --> 02:49:31,450
Oh my god, you fucker!

4075
02:49:37,990 --> 02:49:40,930
He's actually... He's such a fucker.

4076
02:49:41,010 --> 02:49:44,150
He's such a fucker!

4077
02:49:48,010 --> 02:49:48,850
He's such a fucker!

4078
02:49:48,970 --> 02:49:51,710
I'm playing dodgeball right now.

4079
02:49:51,710 --> 02:49:54,850
I'm actually playing dodgeball.

4080
02:49:55,530 --> 02:49:56,450
With them.

4081
02:49:56,850 --> 02:49:58,550
Oh my god.

4082
02:49:58,810 --> 02:50:00,170
Oh my god.

4083
02:50:00,310 --> 02:50:01,290
How many nades!

4084
02:50:01,470 --> 02:50:03,370
How many nades!

4085
02:50:03,550 --> 02:50:04,610
How many nades did this mad throw!

4086
02:50:05,090 --> 02:50:06,710
How fucking...

4087
02:50:07,350 --> 02:50:08,690
How many!

4088
02:50:11,770 --> 02:50:13,610
Holy shit!

4089
02:50:13,610 --> 02:50:15,590
At...

4090
02:50:15,590 --> 02:50:16,530
It has...

4091
02:50:16,530 --> 02:50:19,230
They threw so many at me!

4092
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:22,210
It was actually crazy!

4093
02:50:27,500 --> 02:50:30,180
Oh my god...

4094
02:50:30,180 --> 02:50:30,800
Oh.

4095
02:50:31,220 --> 02:50:32,740
My God.

4096
02:50:34,860 --> 02:50:36,060
Oh.

4097
02:50:37,810 --> 02:50:38,290
Holy shit!

4098
02:50:41,690 --> 02:50:42,510
Holy shit!

4099
02:50:44,330 --> 02:50:45,970
Bro, sign him up!

4100
02:50:46,190 --> 02:50:49,830
I bet he'll get paid more playing baseball than this.

4101
02:50:51,730 --> 02:50:54,630
Bro, get your million dollar contract!

4102
02:50:55,450 --> 02:50:57,050
Bro, what you doing here?

4103
02:51:04,360 --> 02:51:07,160
You're... Seriously, get out of the military!

4104
02:51:10,300 --> 02:51:12,500
Oh my god, that's so close.

4105
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:15,040
You're wasting your skills here!

4106
02:51:17,220 --> 02:51:21,500
The Dodgers would have won if you... The Dodgers would have won if you were there!

4107
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:27,600
Oh my god.

4108
02:51:29,640 --> 02:51:30,240
What, what, what?

4109
02:51:31,220 --> 02:51:32,180
What, what, what?

4110
02:51:35,400 --> 02:51:36,500
Alright, here you go.

4111
02:51:38,240 --> 02:51:39,500
I swear to...

4112
02:51:41,720 --> 02:51:44,000
Oh my god, we both threw our...

4113
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:51,780
More, more, more.

4114
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:55,080
I think the Yankees need him more.

4115
02:51:57,420 --> 02:51:58,900
Holy fuck, I swear to god.

4116
02:51:59,060 --> 02:52:01,150
I was gonna say, if that actually got me...

4117
02:52:04,080 --> 02:52:07,660
Oh my god, this is the most intense 1v1 right now.

4118
02:52:12,420 --> 02:52:14,800
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

4119
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,760
The most fucking intense 1v1.

4120
02:52:25,520 --> 02:52:28,680
Oh my god, these little guys were just watching this entire time.

4121
02:52:29,080 --> 02:52:30,600
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

4122
02:52:37,080 --> 02:52:37,520
Okay.

4123
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:39,200
Yeah, we go this way.

4124
02:52:42,040 --> 02:52:43,540
Okay, we don't go this way.

4125
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:46,920
They respected the 1v1.

4126
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:48,960
Oh, thank god.

4127
02:52:49,660 --> 02:52:50,540
The bridge.

4128
02:52:50,740 --> 02:52:51,540
We made it.

4129
02:52:51,700 --> 02:52:52,340
Let's get to work.

4130
02:52:54,520 --> 02:52:55,560
I saw...

4131
02:52:56,500 --> 02:52:57,700
Is this all you do?

4132
02:52:57,900 --> 02:52:59,900
Is this really all you do every day?

4133
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:02,260
Every fucking day, this is all you do!

4134
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:13,800
Oh my god.

4135
02:53:14,100 --> 02:53:15,560
Oh my god.

4136
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:17,080
The fucking drive-by.

4137
02:53:25,560 --> 02:53:26,200
Okay.

4138
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:31,940
I mean, it worked, though.

4139
02:53:38,220 --> 02:53:39,460
What the fuck?

4140
02:53:40,520 --> 02:53:43,060
I need you to upload me into the control systems.

4141
02:53:43,400 --> 02:53:45,780
The terminal is located next to the main view screen.

4142
02:53:46,960 --> 02:53:47,920
Oh, there you go.

4143
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:53,080
Forgot you have a flashlight, didn't you?

4144
02:53:53,180 --> 02:53:53,900
Okay, I...

4145
02:53:53,900 --> 02:53:55,680
What was I gonna use the flashlight on for?

4146
02:53:56,980 --> 02:53:58,480
Wait, thank you for the super chat.

4147
02:53:58,600 --> 02:53:58,820
Thank you.

4148
02:53:58,920 --> 02:53:59,380
Thank you.

4149
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:03,720
Thank you.

4150
02:54:04,660 --> 02:54:07,660
Would have gone pro if you didn't join the Navy.

4151
02:54:07,660 --> 02:54:09,140
Wait, that's out of the question, really.

4152
02:54:09,440 --> 02:54:10,420
Oh, hell.

4153
02:54:14,040 --> 02:54:15,520
Oh my god, he's back.

4154
02:54:15,720 --> 02:54:16,040
Stupid.

4155
02:54:16,220 --> 02:54:16,720
3-4-3.

4156
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:21,320
He's in my data arrays.

4157
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:22,180
A local tap.

4158
02:54:22,640 --> 02:54:23,940
Oh my god, he's in our heads.

4159
02:54:24,060 --> 02:54:26,140
Can't imagine how exciting this is.

4160
02:54:26,220 --> 02:54:28,880
To have a record of all of our lost time.

4161
02:54:29,560 --> 02:54:30,940
Human history, is it?

4162
02:54:32,060 --> 02:54:32,500
Fascinating.

4163
02:54:33,240 --> 02:54:34,460
Get out of my head!

4164
02:54:34,460 --> 02:54:36,880
Get out of my head!

4165
02:54:37,380 --> 02:54:38,340
Oh, man!

4166
02:54:41,580 --> 02:54:45,460
Oh, how I will enjoy every moment of its categorization.

4167
02:54:45,720 --> 02:54:50,720
To think that you would destroy this installation as well as this record.

4168
02:54:51,400 --> 02:54:52,760
I am shocked.

4169
02:54:53,440 --> 02:54:55,040
Almost too shocked for words.

4170
02:54:57,080 --> 02:54:59,220
He stopped the self-destruct sequence.

4171
02:54:59,820 --> 02:55:00,340
No!

4172
02:55:02,580 --> 02:55:03,100
No!

4173
02:55:04,460 --> 02:55:05,380
Not timed!

4174
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:10,380
At least I still have control over the comm channels.

4175
02:55:10,780 --> 02:55:11,480
Where is he?

4176
02:55:11,620 --> 02:55:13,260
I'm detecting taps throughout the ship.

4177
02:55:13,440 --> 02:55:14,420
Sentinels most likely.

4178
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:15,160
S for the monitor.

4179
02:55:16,420 --> 02:55:17,380
He's in engineering.

4180
02:55:17,620 --> 02:55:19,280
He must be trying to take the core offline.

4181
02:55:19,540 --> 02:55:21,500
Even if I could get the countdown restarted.

4182
02:55:22,180 --> 02:55:23,280
I don't know what to do.

4183
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:27,400
How much firepower would you need to crack one of the engine's shields?

4184
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:28,620
Not much.

4185
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:30,460
A well-placed grenade perhaps, but why?

4186
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:33,260
Oh, I have one!

4187
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:35,360
Yay!

4188
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,800
I can place it in a well-placed area.

4189
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:40,760
Just chuck it, right?

4190
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:44,160
No, please.

4191
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:46,100
Oh, no!

4192
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:48,240
No!

4193
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:49,720
My shield!

4194
02:55:50,340 --> 02:55:51,420
Are you fucking kidding me?

4195
02:55:51,540 --> 02:55:52,860
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

4196
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:54,580
Oh my god, okay.

4197
02:55:59,540 --> 02:56:00,060
Okay.

4198
02:56:02,820 --> 02:56:03,540
That's fine.

4199
02:56:05,360 --> 02:56:07,380
I just wanna get rid of them first before we go.

4200
02:56:07,900 --> 02:56:08,740
Alright, nice.

4201
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:09,720
Where do I go?

4202
02:56:12,240 --> 02:56:12,740
Oh.

4203
02:56:13,280 --> 02:56:14,240
Oh, this way.

4204
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:15,240
Oh, it was this way.

4205
02:56:15,360 --> 02:56:15,520
Okay.

4206
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:16,460
Um.

4207
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:18,740
Ah!

4208
02:56:20,700 --> 02:56:21,200
Ah!

4209
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:28,400
Follow my heart!

4210
02:56:31,140 --> 02:56:33,380
My heart doesn't know where to go!

4211
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:40,860
Where's the yellow paint?

4212
02:56:41,160 --> 02:56:42,120
Where is it?

4213
02:56:44,140 --> 02:56:45,400
Where's the yellow paint?

4214
02:56:46,520 --> 02:56:47,440
Yellow paint!

4215
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:50,540
Oh my god.

4216
02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:53,240
Oh my god, they're back!

4217
02:56:56,260 --> 02:56:59,160
Okay, at least- At least they're here to tell me where to go.

4218
02:57:03,090 --> 02:57:04,750
Oh my god, does it not stop?

4219
02:57:06,130 --> 02:57:06,650
Okay.

4220
02:57:08,110 --> 02:57:08,870
Thank god.

4221
02:57:11,630 --> 02:57:12,110
Okay.

4222
02:57:12,110 --> 02:57:13,650
Thank god they're here to tell me where to go.

4223
02:57:14,590 --> 02:57:15,990
That's everything I needed.

4224
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:23,210
Okay, I'll just wait here until- Until they come in here.

4225
02:57:25,830 --> 02:57:26,790
Fucking baseball.

4226
02:57:29,530 --> 02:57:34,110
Oh my god, they have to go straight- Oh!

4227
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:40,700
Oh my god, they have to go straight- Okay.

4228
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:43,440
Oh!

4229
02:57:44,740 --> 02:57:45,180
Bye.

4230
02:57:46,800 --> 02:57:48,460
I didn't know that was where I had to go.

4231
02:57:48,460 --> 02:57:54,720
I thought I had to fight some- Oh!

4232
02:57:58,570 --> 02:57:59,630
The fight.

4233
02:58:04,710 --> 02:58:05,670
Hello.

4234
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:09,680
Hello.

4235
02:58:13,130 --> 02:58:13,830
Okay.

4236
02:58:14,210 --> 02:58:14,670
Nice.

4237
02:58:19,390 --> 02:58:22,150
Okay, I'm run- I am running out of the alien gun.

4238
02:58:22,390 --> 02:58:25,550
So I'm gonna- Gonna save that a little bit.

4239
02:58:25,670 --> 02:58:26,270
Oh wait, never mind.

4240
02:58:26,570 --> 02:58:26,870
JK.

4241
02:58:27,930 --> 02:58:29,310
I don't have to save it.

4242
02:58:33,320 --> 02:58:33,800
Whoops.

4243
02:58:34,500 --> 02:58:35,100
Guys!

4244
02:58:35,300 --> 02:58:35,600
Guys!

4245
02:58:35,860 --> 02:58:36,060
Guys!

4246
02:58:36,060 --> 02:58:36,240
Babies!

4247
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:36,660
Please!

4248
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:39,020
There is bigger- Bigger fish to fry!

4249
02:58:41,440 --> 02:58:42,740
Alright, this way.

4250
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:46,620
Nice.

4251
02:58:48,900 --> 02:58:49,500
Alright.

4252
02:58:49,860 --> 02:58:50,640
Not nice.

4253
02:58:51,440 --> 02:58:54,080
We'll let them deal with each other.

4254
02:58:55,660 --> 02:58:56,420
I'll wait.

4255
02:58:56,600 --> 02:58:57,180
I can wait.

4256
02:58:57,920 --> 02:58:59,900
I- I can wait.

4257
02:59:05,480 --> 02:59:07,140
Are they- Are they still fighting?

4258
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:09,540
Oh!

4259
02:59:09,900 --> 02:59:12,080
Are they- Are they done?

4260
02:59:13,440 --> 02:59:14,660
So how's the weather?

4261
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:23,000
Okay.

4262
02:59:23,660 --> 02:59:25,320
Let me get rid of these guys first.

4263
02:59:29,790 --> 02:59:31,310
Okay, now I can come in.

4264
02:59:31,630 --> 02:59:32,390
Hello, guys!

4265
02:59:33,050 --> 02:59:34,210
Hello, everybody!

4266
02:59:35,870 --> 02:59:36,490
Wow!

4267
02:59:37,390 --> 02:59:39,590
Can't believe everybody just died like that.

4268
02:59:40,510 --> 02:59:40,870
Huh.

4269
02:59:42,750 --> 02:59:43,230
Just...

4270
02:59:43,230 --> 02:59:43,690
Nice.

4271
02:59:44,990 --> 02:59:47,090
Don't have to do much work after that.

4272
02:59:48,610 --> 02:59:50,290
So conf- Oh, whoop, whoop.

4273
02:59:53,730 --> 02:59:58,470
What the- Okay, okay.

4274
02:59:58,610 --> 03:00:00,230
Oh no, they're- They're ganging up on each other.

4275
03:00:00,310 --> 03:00:01,670
Oh no, I'm getting ganging up on.

4276
03:00:01,990 --> 03:00:03,390
I'm getting ganging up on.

4277
03:00:03,950 --> 03:00:04,130
I'm getting ganging up on.

4278
03:00:04,330 --> 03:00:05,410
Alright, I'm going in.

4279
03:00:07,390 --> 03:00:08,270
It's fine.

4280
03:00:11,330 --> 03:00:12,710
It's totally fine.

4281
03:00:16,760 --> 03:00:17,440
Okay.

4282
03:00:20,460 --> 03:00:21,140
Alright.

4283
03:00:22,440 --> 03:00:24,160
I think I have to go this way.

4284
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:24,920
Alright.

4285
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:26,620
What the fuck?!

4286
03:00:30,340 --> 03:00:31,020
Okay.

4287
03:00:32,260 --> 03:00:33,540
Just gonna let it explode here.

4288
03:00:34,960 --> 03:00:36,500
Oh no, that's not good.

4289
03:00:39,140 --> 03:00:39,900
Okay.

4290
03:00:42,320 --> 03:00:44,400
Oh, this is a push hallway?!

4291
03:00:44,400 --> 03:00:45,400
God dammit!

4292
03:00:46,460 --> 03:00:48,400
Oh ho ho ho my god!

4293
03:00:49,160 --> 03:00:50,200
I did it!

4294
03:00:50,440 --> 03:00:51,360
No, it's infinite!

4295
03:00:51,600 --> 03:00:52,100
Be different!

4296
03:00:52,360 --> 03:00:54,160
It's not self-explanatory!

4297
03:00:58,140 --> 03:00:58,900
Okay.

4298
03:01:03,410 --> 03:01:05,790
Sometimes- Sometimes they're not infinite!

4299
03:01:08,370 --> 03:01:09,730
Sometimes they just stop!

4300
03:01:14,040 --> 03:01:14,900
Alright, this way.

4301
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:16,140
Oh!

4302
03:01:18,140 --> 03:01:19,860
Oh my god, he was running away from them.

4303
03:01:20,820 --> 03:01:22,220
Oh my god!

4304
03:01:24,440 --> 03:01:26,660
Oh, please tell me I- Oh!

4305
03:01:27,400 --> 03:01:27,940
Please stop!

4306
03:01:28,020 --> 03:01:28,560
We have to go this way!

4307
03:01:34,880 --> 03:01:35,960
Alright, that's fine.

4308
03:01:36,140 --> 03:01:37,380
I-I didn't need those shits.

4309
03:01:42,870 --> 03:01:44,350
I-I didn't need it.

4310
03:01:47,050 --> 03:01:47,870
Wait, what?

4311
03:01:51,610 --> 03:01:52,570
Wait, what?

4312
03:01:55,480 --> 03:01:56,820
Where am I supposed to go?

4313
03:01:57,640 --> 03:01:59,300
Oh, we live here now, I guess.

4314
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:01,120
I can live here.

4315
03:02:04,650 --> 03:02:05,610
Do you think they know?

4316
03:02:08,130 --> 03:02:09,730
Did they- did they kill them?

4317
03:02:13,420 --> 03:02:14,320
Did they do it?

4318
03:02:17,460 --> 03:02:19,040
I don't know if they did it.

4319
03:02:28,320 --> 03:02:29,260
I don't know.

4320
03:02:29,580 --> 03:02:30,640
Are you doing it?

4321
03:02:37,160 --> 03:02:38,660
It's very quiet outside.

4322
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:48,760
He naided me.

4323
03:02:49,020 --> 03:02:50,280
He naided me.

4324
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:52,940
He- He naided me.

4325
03:02:53,060 --> 03:02:54,780
He actually naided me.

4326
03:02:54,960 --> 03:02:56,460
He got the naid off.

4327
03:02:56,660 --> 03:02:57,920
He got the naid off.

4328
03:02:58,060 --> 03:02:59,940
He got the fucking naid off!

4329
03:02:59,940 --> 03:03:00,180
He got the naid off!

4330
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:03,840
Fuck you!

4331
03:03:05,500 --> 03:03:06,400
Oh my god.

4332
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:13,600
I'm gonna kill this one guy.

4333
03:03:13,760 --> 03:03:14,780
I need to kill this guy.

4334
03:03:16,400 --> 03:03:17,820
Oh my god, he almost hit me.

4335
03:03:19,400 --> 03:03:20,900
Like, I need him to die.

4336
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:21,880
Just him.

4337
03:03:28,800 --> 03:03:30,560
Like, I just want him to be dead.

4338
03:03:30,760 --> 03:03:31,440
Like, I don't care.

4339
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:40,780
I'm gonna go straight down.

4340
03:03:42,760 --> 03:03:43,800
Oh, Armory.

4341
03:03:47,220 --> 03:03:47,840
Yeah?

4342
03:03:49,560 --> 03:03:51,260
Wait, I need the rocket?

4343
03:03:59,440 --> 03:04:00,440
Oh my god.

4344
03:04:01,310 --> 03:04:02,820
Oh my god, why is he invisible?

4345
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:04,680
Why are they invisible?!

4346
03:04:04,680 --> 03:04:06,740
Why are they invisible?!

4347
03:04:16,460 --> 03:04:17,660
Oh my god.

4348
03:04:21,840 --> 03:04:23,200
Why were they invisible?

4349
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:25,580
Why- why were they invisible?

4350
03:04:25,940 --> 03:04:27,100
I don't understand.

4351
03:04:27,100 --> 03:04:27,920
I-

4352
03:04:30,980 --> 03:04:35,820
I don't- I don't know where the invisible weapon is.

4353
03:04:36,040 --> 03:04:38,260
The voices are fighting back.

4354
03:04:38,600 --> 03:04:41,420
I'm trying to find the rocket logic.

4355
03:04:42,200 --> 03:04:45,600
I'm so confused and- Oh, there we go.

4356
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:47,140
Okay.

4357
03:04:48,860 --> 03:04:50,100
I found it.

4358
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:53,100
What's this invisible secret weapon?

4359
03:04:53,240 --> 03:04:54,580
I don't know what you mean.

4360
03:04:54,580 --> 03:04:55,980
Oh shit.

4361
03:04:56,260 --> 03:04:56,340
No.

4362
03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:56,920
No.

4363
03:04:57,100 --> 03:05:00,320
What the fuck did I- Okay.

4364
03:05:02,440 --> 03:05:02,980
Alright.

4365
03:05:09,980 --> 03:05:10,540
Okay.

4366
03:05:11,440 --> 03:05:12,480
Alright, I'm ready.

4367
03:05:13,860 --> 03:05:15,360
The flood- Oh my god.

4368
03:05:15,480 --> 03:05:17,000
The flood was a secret weapon.

4369
03:05:17,180 --> 03:05:18,060
Oh my god.

4370
03:05:18,060 --> 03:05:19,280
You guys are fuckers.

4371
03:05:19,640 --> 03:05:23,900
You guys- I'm okay.

4372
03:05:31,990 --> 03:05:33,910
Light fuse run away.

4373
03:05:33,910 --> 03:05:33,970
Light fuse run away.

4374
03:05:34,170 --> 03:05:35,190
Is it here?

4375
03:05:35,570 --> 03:05:35,770
Located.

4376
03:05:36,110 --> 03:05:36,410
We're here.

4377
03:05:39,730 --> 03:05:40,270
Alert.

4378
03:05:40,530 --> 03:05:42,970
The monitor has disabled all command access.

4379
03:05:43,470 --> 03:05:44,350
We can't restore the counter.

4380
03:05:44,690 --> 03:05:48,830
The only convenient option is to detonate the ship's fusion reactors.

4381
03:05:49,410 --> 03:05:52,130
That should do enough damage to destroy Halo.

4382
03:05:52,410 --> 03:05:53,130
Don't worry.

4383
03:05:53,330 --> 03:05:56,090
I have access to all of the reactor schematics and procedures.

4384
03:05:56,430 --> 03:05:57,630
I'll walk you through it.

4385
03:05:57,630 --> 03:06:00,350
First, we need to pull back the exhaust couplings.

4386
03:06:00,550 --> 03:06:06,410
That will expose a shaft that leads to the primary fusion- What the fuck are all these arrows?

4387
03:06:07,530 --> 03:06:08,770
Okay, it's infinite.

4388
03:06:09,010 --> 03:06:09,170
Okay.

4389
03:06:09,670 --> 03:06:12,130
The blockades will be removed in 16 cycles.

4390
03:06:17,130 --> 03:06:18,310
Oh my god.

4391
03:06:18,310 --> 03:06:20,390
There's so many arrows on my screen.

4392
03:06:30,040 --> 03:06:31,540
Oh my god, they-

4393
03:06:35,130 --> 03:06:38,750
Okay, I was not expecting two of them to-

4394
03:06:43,010 --> 03:06:43,390
Where?

4395
03:06:44,790 --> 03:06:45,170
This?

4396
03:06:46,430 --> 03:06:48,010
Oh my god, I don't know what that is.

4397
03:06:51,730 --> 03:06:52,110
This?

4398
03:06:54,570 --> 03:06:55,390
Is it this?

4399
03:06:55,750 --> 03:06:56,470
Oh my god.

4400
03:06:57,590 --> 03:06:58,760
I'm so confused.

4401
03:07:00,190 --> 03:07:01,090
The arrow?

4402
03:07:04,090 --> 03:07:05,350
Oh my god.

4403
03:07:06,010 --> 03:07:06,910
I'm dead.

4404
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:13,800
There we go.

4405
03:07:17,490 --> 03:07:18,690
Okay, I get it.

4406
03:07:20,130 --> 03:07:21,330
I get it now.

4407
03:07:27,650 --> 03:07:29,270
Oh my god.

4408
03:07:30,350 --> 03:07:33,470
Use the controls on the- Okay, checkpoint done.

4409
03:07:33,470 --> 03:07:35,810
Okay, I have to do that three more times.

4410
03:07:36,030 --> 03:07:36,930
Okay, I get it.

4411
03:07:42,710 --> 03:07:43,350
What?

4412
03:07:43,590 --> 03:07:44,830
Oh my god.

4413
03:07:45,230 --> 03:07:47,490
It's the- Oh my god!

4414
03:07:50,140 --> 03:07:51,720
He had grenades on him.

4415
03:07:52,320 --> 03:07:56,440
It triggered like a fucking- Oh my god.

4416
03:07:56,580 --> 03:07:58,280
It triggered a chemical reaction.

4417
03:08:04,040 --> 03:08:05,940
Stupid grenade chain.

4418
03:08:07,260 --> 03:08:09,220
I was like so confused.

4419
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:12,480
It's like, what happened?

4420
03:08:17,320 --> 03:08:17,840
Okay.

4421
03:08:20,760 --> 03:08:21,560
Oh my god.

4422
03:08:21,860 --> 03:08:25,240
I thought I was gonna-

4423
03:08:48,410 --> 03:08:49,610
Where's Sierra?

4424
03:08:54,420 --> 03:08:56,580
Oh my god!

4425
03:08:57,080 --> 03:08:57,740
What

4426
03:09:06,980 --> 03:09:06,980
happened?

4427
03:09:06,980 --> 03:09:08,220
Is it- Are you serious?

4428
03:09:18,140 --> 03:09:19,620
What happened?

4429
03:09:23,820 --> 03:09:27,000
He actually- Oh my god.

4430
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:31,180
He jumped into the... Oh my god!

4431
03:09:31,480 --> 03:09:34,060
He jumped into my rocket!

4432
03:09:34,700 --> 03:09:37,880
Oh my god!

4433
03:09:38,480 --> 03:09:45,580
I can't believe he fucking bought it!

4434
03:09:46,020 --> 03:09:47,880
Oh my god!

4435
03:09:48,240 --> 03:09:50,360
That was sick and crazy!

4436
03:09:50,820 --> 03:09:52,740
I can't believe that!

4437
03:09:53,540 --> 03:09:56,020
That was actually crazy!

4438
03:10:02,430 --> 03:10:04,190
Oh my god, that was crazy!

4439
03:10:04,790 --> 03:10:08,710
It was so bullshit that that actually happened, too!

4440
03:10:09,310 --> 03:10:10,990
Oh my god!

4441
03:10:12,310 --> 03:10:14,330
That's actually crazy!

4442
03:10:28,300 --> 03:10:29,320
Come on!

4443
03:10:30,420 --> 03:10:31,900
Come on, come on!

4444
03:10:35,620 --> 03:10:38,060
What the fuck?!

4445
03:10:41,830 --> 03:10:43,950
Oh my god, I'm gonna die!

4446
03:10:45,590 --> 03:10:46,890
I'm gonna die!

4447
03:10:54,910 --> 03:10:55,790
Oh my god!

4448
03:10:55,790 --> 03:10:57,090
The rocket doesn't hit it!

4449
03:10:57,170 --> 03:10:59,350
It doesn't let me aim it at there!

4450
03:11:01,310 --> 03:11:01,870
Okay.

4451
03:11:03,650 --> 03:11:04,730
Oh my god.

4452
03:11:05,550 --> 03:11:08,730
The worst part is because, like, is the, um...

4453
03:11:10,090 --> 03:11:12,630
Because I don't... I don't have the alien gun.

4454
03:11:12,850 --> 03:11:15,110
I hate... Oh my god, the little guys.

4455
03:11:16,470 --> 03:11:17,410
Jesus Christ!

4456
03:11:17,950 --> 03:11:18,910
Let me breathe!

4457
03:11:21,630 --> 03:11:22,290
Get out!

4458
03:11:26,420 --> 03:11:28,300
I... Oh, I'm fucking just going in.

4459
03:11:28,400 --> 03:11:29,060
I'm going straight in.

4460
03:11:29,460 --> 03:11:30,400
I'm going straight in.

4461
03:11:30,520 --> 03:11:30,920
Fuck this.

4462
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:33,480
Okay.

4463
03:11:34,420 --> 03:11:35,400
I hate this part.

4464
03:11:35,540 --> 03:11:36,200
This part sucks.

4465
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:38,060
This part fucking sucks!

4466
03:11:41,240 --> 03:11:41,760
All right.

4467
03:11:42,180 --> 03:11:42,500
All right.

4468
03:11:42,560 --> 03:11:43,380
All right, we'll try this again.

4469
03:11:46,380 --> 03:11:47,640
I'm going to try to nade.

4470
03:11:50,680 --> 03:11:52,880
It's a little... It's a... Guys, it's these guys.

4471
03:11:53,020 --> 03:11:53,460
It's these guys.

4472
03:11:53,580 --> 03:11:53,580
It's these guys.

4473
03:11:53,580 --> 03:11:54,360
These guys are so annoying.

4474
03:11:54,660 --> 03:11:56,460
Because I don't have my alien gun.

4475
03:11:56,460 --> 03:11:56,480
I'm going to try this again.

4476
03:12:06,820 --> 03:12:07,420
Okay.

4477
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:07,680
Am I

4478
03:12:11,930 --> 03:12:14,690
open up?

4479
03:12:14,790 --> 03:12:15,190
Open up!

4480
03:12:15,450 --> 03:12:15,730
Open up!

4481
03:12:16,550 --> 03:12:18,550
The flood continues to multiply.

4482
03:12:18,990 --> 03:12:19,110
I...

4483
03:12:19,110 --> 03:12:25,170
Oh my god!

4484
03:12:25,710 --> 03:12:27,310
How do I throw this?

4485
03:12:32,980 --> 03:12:33,580
Okay.

4486
03:12:33,860 --> 03:12:34,320
That works.

4487
03:12:34,540 --> 03:12:35,020
That works.

4488
03:12:35,240 --> 03:12:35,500
That works.

4489
03:12:39,980 --> 03:12:41,120
Fuck it.

4490
03:12:41,200 --> 03:12:41,920
I'll take that.

4491
03:12:43,900 --> 03:12:46,020
I'll take it.

4492
03:12:46,440 --> 03:12:48,060
I'll take it.

4493
03:12:50,940 --> 03:12:52,420
Where's the last one?

4494
03:12:53,580 --> 03:12:55,320
We must keep moving.

4495
03:12:55,800 --> 03:12:56,900
The Dodgers.

4496
03:12:58,160 --> 03:13:01,520
I never said I'd be in the Dodgers, guys.

4497
03:13:02,240 --> 03:13:03,720
I'm so sad.

4498
03:13:04,740 --> 03:13:05,300
Wait.

4499
03:13:05,460 --> 03:13:06,040
How do I... Okay.

4500
03:13:06,180 --> 03:13:07,060
I have to get to the other side.

4501
03:13:14,530 --> 03:13:15,090
Okay.

4502
03:13:18,170 --> 03:13:19,730
Oh my god.

4503
03:13:21,190 --> 03:13:22,490
Is it this way?

4504
03:13:23,390 --> 03:13:24,870
Oh, it's this way.

4505
03:13:29,670 --> 03:13:30,970
Are you serious?

4506
03:13:31,210 --> 03:13:33,130
Where the fuck did you come from?

4507
03:13:45,220 --> 03:13:45,660
Okay.

4508
03:13:46,160 --> 03:13:46,600
Okay.

4509
03:13:48,240 --> 03:13:48,980
All right.

4510
03:13:50,120 --> 03:13:50,560
Okay.

4511
03:13:50,680 --> 03:13:51,540
This one was easier.

4512
03:13:55,840 --> 03:13:57,140
Oh my god.

4513
03:13:58,140 --> 03:13:59,160
Oh my god.

4514
03:13:59,260 --> 03:13:59,560
Get out of here.

4515
03:13:59,880 --> 03:14:01,340
Oh my god.

4516
03:14:01,540 --> 03:14:01,980
Why?

4517
03:14:02,300 --> 03:14:03,120
Oh my god.

4518
03:14:03,220 --> 03:14:04,120
There's so many of you guys.

4519
03:14:04,680 --> 03:14:05,420
Get out of here.

4520
03:14:05,580 --> 03:14:06,200
Get out.

4521
03:14:06,200 --> 03:14:07,480
Get out of here.

4522
03:14:10,380 --> 03:14:10,960
Why?

4523
03:14:11,560 --> 03:14:14,520
Why were you all just bunched up here?

4524
03:14:19,660 --> 03:14:20,500
Oh my god.

4525
03:14:20,620 --> 03:14:21,400
How do I get...

4526
03:14:21,400 --> 03:14:22,660
How do I get there?

4527
03:14:25,760 --> 03:14:26,340
Wait.

4528
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:28,160
How do I get to that side?

4529
03:14:31,340 --> 03:14:32,620
Oh my god.

4530
03:14:32,760 --> 03:14:33,780
I have to climb all the way back.

4531
03:14:34,460 --> 03:14:35,860
Oh my god.

4532
03:14:36,640 --> 03:14:38,620
I could have parkoured?

4533
03:14:39,080 --> 03:14:40,480
I'm gonna try to parkour.

4534
03:14:40,840 --> 03:14:41,380
I...

4535
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:42,700
I'm gonna try.

4536
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:44,160
I don't care.

4537
03:14:44,700 --> 03:14:45,380
Let him come in.

4538
03:14:45,540 --> 03:14:46,580
I'm gonna try parkouring.

4539
03:14:50,600 --> 03:14:51,620
I don't care.

4540
03:14:51,660 --> 03:14:55,220
I don't care.

4541
03:14:55,340 --> 03:14:56,020
All right.

4542
03:14:56,480 --> 03:14:56,560
Oh.

4543
03:15:00,820 --> 03:15:01,340
Oh.

4544
03:15:08,080 --> 03:15:09,200
Give me a sec.

4545
03:15:09,400 --> 03:15:10,200
Give me down!

4546
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:11,960
That's on me.

4547
03:15:12,120 --> 03:15:13,180
That was on me.

4548
03:15:13,660 --> 03:15:14,900
That was on me.

4549
03:15:15,160 --> 03:15:15,580
That was on me.

4550
03:15:15,580 --> 03:15:16,420
That was on me.

4551
03:15:16,420 --> 03:15:17,560
I'm fucking...

4552
03:15:17,560 --> 03:15:18,080
I...

4553
03:15:18,080 --> 03:15:18,200
Okay.

4554
03:15:18,560 --> 03:15:19,720
I'm a little tilted.

4555
03:15:19,720 --> 03:15:20,240
I'm...

4556
03:15:23,380 --> 03:15:25,460
I don't know if that's noticeable.

4557
03:15:26,120 --> 03:15:26,620
I'm...

4558
03:15:27,520 --> 03:15:29,120
I'm a little tilted.

4559
03:15:32,800 --> 03:15:34,240
Oh my god.

4560
03:15:34,400 --> 03:15:34,780
I can't.

4561
03:15:34,920 --> 03:15:35,640
I can't.

4562
03:15:35,780 --> 03:15:37,680
These little fucking popcorn fuckers.

4563
03:15:37,820 --> 03:15:38,260
I can't.

4564
03:15:39,060 --> 03:15:40,500
I can't.

4565
03:15:40,580 --> 03:15:41,160
I can't.

4566
03:15:41,200 --> 03:15:42,260
I can't focus.

4567
03:15:46,180 --> 03:15:46,940
Okay.

4568
03:15:46,940 --> 03:15:49,360
Oh my god.

4569
03:15:49,920 --> 03:15:52,160
How did I first try this?

4570
03:15:54,540 --> 03:15:55,100
Okay.

4571
03:15:55,940 --> 03:15:56,500
I...

4572
03:15:58,240 --> 03:15:59,020
It's okay.

4573
03:15:59,300 --> 03:16:00,280
I can do this.

4574
03:16:00,460 --> 03:16:01,680
I can do this.

4575
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:03,200
I'm so...

4576
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:04,860
I'm so fucking...

4577
03:16:04,860 --> 03:16:05,380
Okay.

4578
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:06,020
Okay.

4579
03:16:06,280 --> 03:16:06,920
Like this is it.

4580
03:16:07,060 --> 03:16:07,420
This is it.

4581
03:16:07,520 --> 03:16:08,220
I can do this.

4582
03:16:08,400 --> 03:16:09,140
I can do this.

4583
03:16:09,360 --> 03:16:10,840
I can do this.

4584
03:16:13,760 --> 03:16:14,300
Okay.

4585
03:16:14,560 --> 03:16:15,100
Okay.

4586
03:16:15,440 --> 03:16:15,980
Okay.

4587
03:16:16,560 --> 03:16:17,100
Okay.

4588
03:16:17,280 --> 03:16:17,360
Okay.

4589
03:16:17,360 --> 03:16:18,750
Now how the fuck do I...

4590
03:16:21,100 --> 03:16:21,640
Okay.

4591
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:26,700
Oh my god.

4592
03:16:31,340 --> 03:16:32,400
I give up.

4593
03:16:32,560 --> 03:16:33,460
I give up.

4594
03:16:33,580 --> 03:16:34,340
I give up.

4595
03:16:34,420 --> 03:16:35,040
I'm gonna die.

4596
03:16:35,240 --> 03:16:36,140
I'm gonna die.

4597
03:16:36,320 --> 03:16:37,480
I'm actually gonna die.

4598
03:16:37,480 --> 03:16:39,640
Oh my god, I'm actually gonna die.

4599
03:16:42,040 --> 03:16:42,920
I give up.

4600
03:16:43,060 --> 03:16:43,600
I give up.

4601
03:16:43,680 --> 03:16:44,700
Give me your last health back.

4602
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:46,500
I can't.

4603
03:16:46,600 --> 03:16:47,840
I fucking can't.

4604
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:49,860
I'm gonna walk all the way up.

4605
03:16:50,020 --> 03:16:52,180
I can't, I can't do this anymore.

4606
03:16:52,640 --> 03:16:55,320
I can't do this anymore.

4607
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:57,080
I know that I can't.

4608
03:16:57,480 --> 03:16:59,760
There's too much anger in me.

4609
03:17:00,180 --> 03:17:05,640
There's too much... I know what crouch jumping is!

4610
03:17:05,800 --> 03:17:06,680
I do!

4611
03:17:07,180 --> 03:17:08,760
I'm just too angry.

4612
03:17:09,020 --> 03:17:11,580
I'm too angry to do it.

4613
03:17:11,980 --> 03:17:17,740
I... I'm just...

4614
03:17:17,740 --> 03:17:20,160
I have too much hate inside me.

4615
03:17:20,300 --> 03:17:24,500
I... There's too much hate, guys.

4616
03:17:24,640 --> 03:17:25,900
I can't.

4617
03:17:28,500 --> 03:17:29,740
There we go.

4618
03:17:30,160 --> 03:17:31,240
There we go.

4619
03:17:31,320 --> 03:17:32,420
There we go.

4620
03:17:34,160 --> 03:17:34,980
There we go.

4621
03:17:41,210 --> 03:17:42,730
Oh, get off the ship!

4622
03:17:46,350 --> 03:17:47,630
Oh my god.

4623
03:17:48,450 --> 03:17:49,670
Oh my god.

4624
03:17:49,810 --> 03:17:51,570
I don't remember how to leave.

4625
03:17:52,750 --> 03:17:55,390
There's a service corridor that runs along the ship's dorsal structure.

4626
03:17:55,550 --> 03:17:56,110
Hurry!

4627
03:17:56,790 --> 03:17:57,090
Where?

4628
03:17:59,150 --> 03:18:01,090
It's on the third floor!

4629
03:18:03,870 --> 03:18:04,530
Okay.

4630
03:18:05,090 --> 03:18:05,990
Let's go back up.

4631
03:18:06,430 --> 03:18:10,010
Let's go back up to the third floor.

4632
03:18:10,490 --> 03:18:11,410
Oh my god.

4633
03:18:11,750 --> 03:18:13,070
Give me a sec.

4634
03:18:13,450 --> 03:18:15,490
I gotta go this way, apparently.

4635
03:18:16,050 --> 03:18:16,230
Alright.

4636
03:18:17,530 --> 03:18:19,890
It's on the third floor.

4637
03:18:24,910 --> 03:18:25,630
Okay.

4638
03:18:28,090 --> 03:18:28,810
Alright.

4639
03:18:28,970 --> 03:18:29,490
Here we go.

4640
03:18:33,660 --> 03:18:36,500
At least... I could've crossed.

4641
03:18:36,740 --> 03:18:37,640
It's okay.

4642
03:18:38,080 --> 03:18:38,760
It's okay.

4643
03:18:39,360 --> 03:18:41,440
I... Sometimes life be like that.

4644
03:18:41,820 --> 03:18:44,780
Sometimes... There's just so much hate in me.

4645
03:18:44,780 --> 03:18:49,780
It's... I'm not okay.

4646
03:18:50,180 --> 03:18:50,960
I'm not okay.

4647
03:18:50,960 --> 03:18:52,080
I am not okay, chat.

4648
03:18:52,420 --> 03:18:54,780
I am absolutely not okay.

4649
03:18:55,280 --> 03:18:56,960
After that parkour.

4650
03:18:58,560 --> 03:18:59,360
Alright.

4651
03:19:00,280 --> 03:19:02,240
We're... We're making it.

4652
03:19:03,280 --> 03:19:05,400
Oh thank god there's arrows.

4653
03:19:05,980 --> 03:19:07,240
Thank fucking god.

4654
03:19:07,520 --> 03:19:08,880
Get me out of here.

4655
03:19:10,980 --> 03:19:12,280
Oh my god.

4656
03:19:12,520 --> 03:19:14,000
I've been through so much.

4657
03:19:14,160 --> 03:19:15,740
I've been through so much.

4658
03:19:15,740 --> 03:19:17,200
You can't do this to me.

4659
03:19:21,440 --> 03:19:21,940
Wait.

4660
03:19:21,940 --> 03:19:22,000
What?

4661
03:19:24,020 --> 03:19:24,520
What?

4662
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:24,600
Matt.

4663
03:19:25,440 --> 03:19:25,900
Oh.

4664
03:19:26,020 --> 03:19:26,220
Okay.

4665
03:19:30,460 --> 03:19:30,960
Nice.

4666
03:19:37,560 --> 03:19:40,220
I can't... I was... I had so much hate in me.

4667
03:19:40,360 --> 03:19:41,500
I just couldn't jump anymore.

4668
03:19:41,500 --> 03:19:41,660
One more.

4669
03:19:55,920 --> 03:19:56,520
No.

4670
03:19:57,120 --> 03:19:57,500
No.

4671
03:19:57,820 --> 03:20:01,000
We have a wildcat destabilization of the ship's fusion core.

4672
03:20:01,180 --> 03:20:04,040
The engines must have sustained more damage than we thought.

4673
03:20:04,700 --> 03:20:05,300
Analyze.

4674
03:20:06,040 --> 03:20:08,880
We have six minutes before the fusion drives density.

4675
03:20:09,380 --> 03:20:10,300
You need to be backwards.

4676
03:20:13,660 --> 03:20:15,000
Get me out of here.

4677
03:20:21,170 --> 03:20:22,670
Get me out of here.

4678
03:20:29,910 --> 03:20:31,630
Get me out of here.

4679
03:20:31,790 --> 03:20:32,010
Please.

4680
03:20:32,910 --> 03:20:33,330
Please.

4681
03:20:33,570 --> 03:20:35,230
I must make it past this.

4682
03:20:36,510 --> 03:20:38,670
Just keep driving!

4683
03:20:40,670 --> 03:20:41,490
Weeeeeee!

4684
03:20:45,110 --> 03:20:46,390
1 point.

4685
03:20:55,560 --> 03:20:56,380
Weeeeeee!

4686
03:20:56,380 --> 03:20:58,240
Just head straight.

4687
03:20:58,480 --> 03:21:01,920
They can't stop me if I just keep going straight.

4688
03:21:02,080 --> 03:21:04,780
They can't stop me.

4689
03:21:06,460 --> 03:21:07,360
No!

4690
03:21:08,880 --> 03:21:10,440
Oh my god!

4691
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:12,340
Oh my god!

4692
03:21:12,940 --> 03:21:19,220
I went the wrong back and see- I'm okay.

4693
03:21:19,480 --> 03:21:20,440
I'm okay.

4694
03:21:20,700 --> 03:21:21,580
I'm okay.

4695
03:21:22,060 --> 03:21:23,920
Oh my god.

4696
03:21:24,180 --> 03:21:25,440
I'm okay.

4697
03:21:26,240 --> 03:21:28,070
I'm so okay.

4698
03:21:28,070 --> 03:21:29,350
I'm okay right now.

4699
03:21:29,570 --> 03:21:30,750
I'm not.

4700
03:21:32,070 --> 03:21:32,830
Alright.

4701
03:21:33,330 --> 03:21:34,550
Just keep driving.

4702
03:21:35,350 --> 03:21:37,390
It's a good thing I didn't panic, guys.

4703
03:21:37,710 --> 03:21:38,590
Thank god.

4704
03:21:39,690 --> 03:21:41,970
Thank god I didn't panic, chat.

4705
03:21:42,670 --> 03:21:44,690
Thank- Oh my god!

4706
03:21:45,410 --> 03:21:47,150
Oh my- Just shoot me more!

4707
03:21:47,610 --> 03:21:48,790
Shoot me more!

4708
03:21:49,230 --> 03:21:50,990
Surely something will happen.

4709
03:21:56,130 --> 03:21:57,490
Okay, here we go.

4710
03:21:57,570 --> 03:21:59,790
We made it to this side.

4711
03:22:01,430 --> 03:22:02,490
Here we go.

4712
03:22:07,190 --> 03:22:07,790
Wee!

4713
03:22:07,790 --> 03:22:08,390
Wee!

4714
03:22:09,610 --> 03:22:11,210
What do you mean loading done?

4715
03:22:11,570 --> 03:22:13,590
What else is there to load for me?

4716
03:22:14,250 --> 03:22:16,970
And why does it not say checkpoint done?

4717
03:22:17,390 --> 03:22:19,470
Why does it say loading done?

4718
03:22:21,130 --> 03:22:21,770
Wee!

4719
03:22:21,890 --> 03:22:23,150
Oh my god!

4720
03:22:23,550 --> 03:22:26,130
Hey guys, I'm gonna go this way now.

4721
03:22:30,110 --> 03:22:31,530
I'll figure out.

4722
03:22:31,630 --> 03:22:32,130
I'll figure out.

4723
03:22:32,130 --> 03:22:33,310
Oh my god.

4724
03:22:33,650 --> 03:22:36,590
Guys, give me a sec.

4725
03:22:36,750 --> 03:22:39,030
I'll figure out how to get through this area.

4726
03:22:39,690 --> 03:22:40,750
Holy shit!

4727
03:22:41,170 --> 03:22:42,370
Holy shit!

4728
03:22:42,450 --> 03:22:43,910
There's so many explosives!

4729
03:22:44,510 --> 03:22:45,930
Oh my god!

4730
03:22:46,950 --> 03:22:50,830
There's so many explosives, everyone!

4731
03:22:55,330 --> 03:22:55,910
Wee!

4732
03:22:58,470 --> 03:22:59,550
Please help me!

4733
03:22:59,690 --> 03:23:01,090
This is the final area!

4734
03:23:03,390 --> 03:23:03,970
Wee!

4735
03:23:05,210 --> 03:23:06,230
Wait, stop!

4736
03:23:06,490 --> 03:23:08,470
This is where Fohhammer is coming to pick us up!

4737
03:23:08,630 --> 03:23:09,810
Hold position here!

4738
03:23:12,430 --> 03:23:13,010
Hello?

4739
03:23:13,990 --> 03:23:15,570
Cortana to Echo 419!

4740
03:23:15,930 --> 03:23:18,190
Two Covenant Banshees are approaching on your 6!

4741
03:23:18,470 --> 03:23:18,990
Evade!

4742
03:23:19,110 --> 03:23:19,670
Say again!

4743
03:23:19,810 --> 03:23:20,270
Evade!

4744
03:23:20,950 --> 03:23:22,230
Am I safe?

4745
03:23:25,070 --> 03:23:26,330
I can't tell!

4746
03:23:30,030 --> 03:23:31,150
Is she okay?

4747
03:23:34,110 --> 03:23:35,830
Oh, she was not okay.

4748
03:23:36,870 --> 03:23:37,430
AAAAAAAAAAicle?

4749
03:23:38,970 --> 03:23:41,990
One long looking Emperor of O Lord is still docked in Launch Base 7.

4750
03:23:42,210 --> 03:23:43,990
If we move now, we can make it.

4751
03:24:01,750 --> 03:24:02,310
Negative.

4752
03:24:02,570 --> 03:24:02,770
Negative.

4753
03:24:03,070 --> 03:24:06,330
We have a Wildcat destabilization of the Jets-Fusion Core.

4754
03:24:06,490 --> 03:24:09,410
The engines must have sustained more damage than we thought.

4755
03:24:10,210 --> 03:24:10,770
Analyzing.

4756
03:24:11,370 --> 03:24:14,370
We have six minutes before the fusion drives detonate.

4757
03:24:14,490 --> 03:24:15,810
We need to evac now.

4758
03:24:15,810 --> 03:24:17,550
Activating final countdown timer.

4759
03:24:17,610 --> 03:24:19,870
When it reaches zero, the engines will die.

4760
03:24:20,270 --> 03:24:24,350
The explosion will generate a temperature of almost 100 million degrees.

4761
03:24:24,950 --> 03:24:26,990
Don't matter when it blows.

4762
03:24:28,450 --> 03:24:29,190
No!

4763
03:24:30,110 --> 03:24:31,810
I went so hard!

4764
03:24:32,490 --> 03:24:36,530
I went... Oh my god!

4765
03:24:41,910 --> 03:24:44,930
I did so well!

4766
03:24:52,730 --> 03:24:53,410
I was gaming!

4767
03:24:54,110 --> 03:24:55,770
I was actually gaming!

4768
03:24:56,630 --> 03:24:58,330
How did this happen to me?

4769
03:24:59,070 --> 03:25:03,290
How did... I got shot in the back!

4770
03:25:04,190 --> 03:25:06,370
Oh my god!

4771
03:25:07,210 --> 03:25:10,150
I can't believe...

4772
03:25:10,150 --> 03:25:12,370
Oh my god!

4773
03:25:12,590 --> 03:25:14,410
I was so close!

4774
03:25:15,090 --> 03:25:17,510
I was so fucking close!

4775
03:25:17,650 --> 03:25:20,490
I fell off!

4776
03:25:20,650 --> 03:25:22,210
Out of my car!

4777
03:25:35,490 --> 03:25:37,450
I couldn't get back up!

4778
03:25:43,540 --> 03:25:46,020
I couldn't get back up!

4779
03:25:50,480 --> 03:25:50,980
No!

4780
03:25:51,180 --> 03:25:57,760
I was trying... I was trying to turn my car back forward because it flipped!

4781
03:25:57,760 --> 03:26:00,120
It's... Oh my god!

4782
03:26:00,680 --> 03:26:03,020
My car flipped just...

4783
03:26:11,970 --> 03:26:15,130
I didn't know I had to keep driving!

4784
03:26:16,030 --> 03:26:17,570
Oh my god!

4785
03:26:17,850 --> 03:26:18,410
It's over!

4786
03:26:18,710 --> 03:26:20,690
It's over for me!

4787
03:26:20,970 --> 03:26:22,430
I'm 2 HP!

4788
03:26:23,130 --> 03:26:24,570
It's over!

4789
03:26:24,990 --> 03:26:27,670
It's never been so over!

4790
03:26:28,190 --> 03:26:30,110
It's never...

4791
03:26:34,130 --> 03:26:36,710
I was trying to

4792
03:26:45,760 --> 03:26:46,500
get back up!

4793
03:26:46,760 --> 03:26:48,040
I was trying to get a car!

4794
03:26:55,690 --> 03:26:58,470
Nobody told me that was a thing!

4795
03:27:01,550 --> 03:27:02,430
Okay.

4796
03:27:06,810 --> 03:27:08,850
Oh my god!

4797
03:27:09,390 --> 03:27:12,630
I've never seen that happen to anyone!

4798
03:27:13,070 --> 03:27:13,950
Congratulations!

4799
03:27:15,210 --> 03:27:17,010
It was me!

4800
03:27:22,140 --> 03:27:27,800
At destabilization of the ship's fusion core, the engines must have sustained more damage than we thought!

4801
03:27:28,660 --> 03:27:29,300
Analyzing...

4802
03:27:29,300 --> 03:27:32,760
We have 6 minutes before the fusion drives detonate.

4803
03:27:33,080 --> 03:27:34,220
We need to evac now!

4804
03:27:34,560 --> 03:27:35,920
Activating final countdown timer!

4805
03:27:40,140 --> 03:27:41,940
Oh my god!

4806
03:27:41,940 --> 03:27:43,140
The car crushing!

4807
03:27:43,560 --> 03:27:45,900
The car fucking crushing!

4808
03:27:45,900 --> 03:27:45,920
The car fucking crushing!

4809
03:27:46,460 --> 03:27:47,920
That can happen?!

4810
03:27:50,420 --> 03:27:53,920
The car... The car can just...

4811
03:27:55,900 --> 03:27:57,580
Oh my god!

4812
03:27:58,160 --> 03:27:58,600
Oh!

4813
03:27:58,700 --> 03:27:59,300
Just kill me!

4814
03:27:59,400 --> 03:28:00,060
I'm 1 HP!

4815
03:28:00,780 --> 03:28:01,480
Just... Oh!

4816
03:28:01,720 --> 03:28:03,520
I just... Just get this over with!

4817
03:28:03,700 --> 03:28:04,580
I'm 1 HP!

4818
03:28:04,580 --> 03:28:06,920
Just get this over with!

4819
03:28:07,380 --> 03:28:07,760
Negative!

4820
03:28:08,120 --> 03:28:08,180
Negative!

4821
03:28:08,560 --> 03:28:11,820
We have a wildcat destabilization of the ship's fusion core!

4822
03:28:12,220 --> 03:28:12,460
Oh my god!

4823
03:28:12,460 --> 03:28:14,860
The engines must have sustained more damage than we thought!

4824
03:28:15,300 --> 03:28:16,820
This is the...

4825
03:28:17,300 --> 03:28:19,300
You're doing the impossible!

4826
03:28:19,920 --> 03:28:21,400
Oh my god!

4827
03:28:22,200 --> 03:28:23,420
Oh my god!

4828
03:28:23,680 --> 03:28:26,440
How are the runs getting worse and worse?

4829
03:28:26,700 --> 03:28:28,380
It's actually crazy!

4830
03:28:28,380 --> 03:28:31,740
The... The rage run... I do worse!

4831
03:28:32,280 --> 03:28:33,760
Oh my god!

4832
03:28:33,940 --> 03:28:35,500
I don't know how that's possible!

4833
03:28:35,840 --> 03:28:38,660
I don't know how I do worse every run!

4834
03:28:39,180 --> 03:28:41,460
I... I... I... Don't... No!

4835
03:28:44,280 --> 03:28:45,080
Okay.

4836
03:28:46,260 --> 03:28:47,320
This is fine.

4837
03:28:49,220 --> 03:28:50,500
This is fine.

4838
03:28:54,210 --> 03:28:57,130
This is... This is... This is not fine.

4839
03:28:57,410 --> 03:28:58,830
But like, this is fine.

4840
03:29:00,890 --> 03:29:01,670
Alright.

4841
03:29:02,670 --> 03:29:02,990
I...

4842
03:29:07,030 --> 03:29:12,150
I can't believe... I can't believe I almost first tried it!

4843
03:29:12,330 --> 03:29:14,570
I almost first tried it!

4844
03:29:14,570 --> 03:29:16,870
This is... My car!

4845
03:29:17,330 --> 03:29:18,470
My car!

4846
03:29:18,730 --> 03:29:18,850
My car!

4847
03:29:18,850 --> 03:29:19,670
Fucking...

4848
03:29:19,670 --> 03:29:21,990
I can't believe my car!

4849
03:29:22,510 --> 03:29:23,290
NO!

4850
03:29:27,010 --> 03:29:27,810
Oh my god!

4851
03:29:28,090 --> 03:29:29,210
Oh my god.

4852
03:29:29,350 --> 03:29:30,110
They're all beaming me.

4853
03:29:30,330 --> 03:29:31,090
It's... It's like...

4854
03:29:31,090 --> 03:29:32,870
The fucking cancer rate!

4855
03:29:33,550 --> 03:29:35,430
Oh my god!

4856
03:29:36,230 --> 03:29:38,010
Oh my god!

4857
03:29:38,250 --> 03:29:39,570
How many flips!

4858
03:29:39,830 --> 03:29:41,610
How many flips?!

4859
03:29:45,510 --> 03:29:45,970
Okay.

4860
03:29:49,270 --> 03:29:50,830
Okay, here you go.

4861
03:29:50,830 --> 03:29:52,150
There you go.

4862
03:29:52,210 --> 03:29:54,090
Okay, no joke.

4863
03:29:54,650 --> 03:29:56,770
It just keeps flipping!

4864
03:29:57,310 --> 03:29:58,490
What do I do?

4865
03:29:58,670 --> 03:30:00,190
It just keeps flipping.

4866
03:30:00,810 --> 03:30:03,210
One more flip for the road.

4867
03:30:03,870 --> 03:30:04,090
What?

4868
03:30:06,230 --> 03:30:08,110
Oh my god.

4869
03:30:08,810 --> 03:30:11,390
Please just fuck me, I guess.

4870
03:30:14,290 --> 03:30:16,270
It was like, nice flip.

4871
03:30:16,350 --> 03:30:18,850
You know I'm playing Tony Hawk's pro skateboard right now.

4872
03:30:19,010 --> 03:30:20,270
That's what I'm playing.

4873
03:30:26,890 --> 03:30:28,730
Tony Hawk's skateboard.

4874
03:30:29,150 --> 03:30:30,070
Let's go.

4875
03:30:35,430 --> 03:30:36,030
Alright.

4876
03:30:36,030 --> 03:30:36,630
Weeeeee!

4877
03:30:39,390 --> 03:30:39,990
Weeeeee!

4878
03:30:40,090 --> 03:30:41,310
Alright, don't make it.

4879
03:30:41,490 --> 03:30:41,730
Okay.

4880
03:30:42,150 --> 03:30:42,770
Hey, guys.

4881
03:30:44,270 --> 03:30:44,450
Hey.

4882
03:30:45,690 --> 03:30:46,910
Hey, everyone.

4883
03:30:47,410 --> 03:30:49,010
Oh, why did I go that way?

4884
03:30:49,190 --> 03:30:50,650
I don't know.

4885
03:30:51,130 --> 03:30:52,690
I don't know why.

4886
03:31:00,930 --> 03:31:02,310
Oh my god.

4887
03:31:03,470 --> 03:31:05,170
Oh my god, get me in here.

4888
03:31:05,370 --> 03:31:07,570
Oh my god.

4889
03:31:12,870 --> 03:31:13,510
Alright.

4890
03:31:14,770 --> 03:31:15,830
Oh, we got work.

4891
03:31:16,910 --> 03:31:18,110
We have one more.

4892
03:31:18,510 --> 03:31:20,170
Oh my god, we're here.

4893
03:31:21,270 --> 03:31:23,130
Loading that I'm gonna keep driving.

4894
03:31:23,190 --> 03:31:24,770
I'm gonna keep driving.

4895
03:31:25,570 --> 03:31:26,230
No.

4896
03:31:26,690 --> 03:31:27,310
No!

4897
03:31:27,790 --> 03:31:29,070
We do not stop!

4898
03:31:37,930 --> 03:31:39,610
We do not stop.

4899
03:31:39,830 --> 03:31:40,970
We do not stop.

4900
03:31:41,330 --> 03:31:42,450
We do not stop.

4901
03:31:42,650 --> 03:31:43,990
We do not stop.

4902
03:31:44,250 --> 03:31:44,890
We do not stop.

4903
03:31:44,890 --> 03:31:45,850
We do not stop.

4904
03:31:49,310 --> 03:31:50,870
Oh my god, why?

4905
03:31:51,430 --> 03:31:54,150
Why is my car turning like that?

4906
03:31:54,810 --> 03:31:56,530
Oh my god.

4907
03:31:57,210 --> 03:31:58,990
What is going on with my car?

4908
03:32:00,950 --> 03:32:03,030
Oh my god, I can't control it.

4909
03:32:03,230 --> 03:32:05,370
It has a mind of its own.

4910
03:32:05,790 --> 03:32:07,970
I can't control it anymore.

4911
03:32:08,990 --> 03:32:10,110
I swear.

4912
03:32:10,590 --> 03:32:12,250
I can't control it.

4913
03:32:15,850 --> 03:32:18,230
It has a mind of its own.

4914
03:32:20,730 --> 03:32:21,830
Oh god.

4915
03:32:23,150 --> 03:32:24,850
Oh my god.

4916
03:32:26,090 --> 03:32:26,890
Don't flip.

4917
03:32:27,250 --> 03:32:27,670
Don't flip.

4918
03:32:27,870 --> 03:32:28,570
Don't flip.

4919
03:32:31,930 --> 03:32:33,830
Oh my god, am I at top speed?

4920
03:32:34,010 --> 03:32:35,510
Am I at top speed?

4921
03:32:35,710 --> 03:32:36,970
Oh my god.

4922
03:32:37,170 --> 03:32:38,290
Am I...

4923
03:32:38,290 --> 03:32:38,530
No!

4924
03:32:48,680 --> 03:32:50,580
Guys, I was not at top speed.

4925
03:32:50,800 --> 03:32:53,300
I was not at top speed.

4926
03:32:54,380 --> 03:32:57,260
I... I was not.

4927
03:32:59,880 --> 03:33:00,560
Alright.

4928
03:33:01,120 --> 03:33:02,240
Oh, we're so close.

4929
03:33:02,440 --> 03:33:03,860
We're so fucking close.

4930
03:33:04,200 --> 03:33:05,360
Oh my god, please.

4931
03:33:05,620 --> 03:33:06,140
Please.

4932
03:33:06,460 --> 03:33:08,400
We're almost at the freedom.

4933
03:33:09,060 --> 03:33:09,440
We're...

4934
03:33:10,380 --> 03:33:12,040
Oh, my God.

4935
03:33:12,620 --> 03:33:16,460
I don't... Oh, shit.

4936
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:17,740
I'm going.

4937
03:33:18,020 --> 03:33:18,800
I'm going.

4938
03:33:19,080 --> 03:33:20,160
Oh, God.

4939
03:33:20,380 --> 03:33:21,260
I'm running.

4940
03:33:21,640 --> 03:33:22,660
I'm running.

4941
03:33:23,420 --> 03:33:24,960
Oh, don't look back.

4942
03:33:25,640 --> 03:33:26,200
Cool, guys.

4943
03:33:26,360 --> 03:33:26,680
No good.

4944
03:33:27,000 --> 03:33:29,340
Oh, I'm sorry for looking back.

4945
03:33:29,760 --> 03:33:30,620
No, no.

4946
03:33:30,880 --> 03:33:31,780
They can't do this to me.

4947
03:33:32,060 --> 03:33:34,600
Oh, shit.

4948
03:33:35,200 --> 03:33:36,480
I almost died.

4949
03:33:36,900 --> 03:33:39,120
If he shot one more bullet.

4950
03:33:39,440 --> 03:33:40,420
I would have been gone.

4951
03:33:40,800 --> 03:33:41,980
I would have been gone.

4952
03:33:45,140 --> 03:33:46,220
Don't stop.

4953
03:33:49,380 --> 03:33:50,400
Holy shit.

4954
03:33:54,700 --> 03:33:57,340
Almost lost it all for the bit.

4955
03:34:02,140 --> 03:34:04,780
Cam, thank you for the super gem.

4956
03:34:04,940 --> 03:34:07,000
Thank you for his try.

4957
03:34:17,110 --> 03:34:17,950
Oh, my God.

4958
03:34:17,990 --> 03:34:18,730
Did I do it?

4959
03:34:19,550 --> 03:34:22,150
Did I... Did I do it?

4960
03:34:29,590 --> 03:34:30,490
Oh, my God.

4961
03:34:30,590 --> 03:34:32,230
The plan exploded.

4962
03:34:33,090 --> 03:34:36,830
Oh, shut them down.

4963
03:34:37,010 --> 03:34:37,570
We'll need them later.

4964
03:34:46,410 --> 03:34:48,810
Oh, I

4965
03:34:57,570 --> 03:34:59,990
did it.

4966
03:35:00,270 --> 03:35:01,170
I did it.

4967
03:35:01,170 --> 03:35:02,170
I... I did it.

4968
03:35:02,830 --> 03:35:04,650
I... I lived.

4969
03:35:05,250 --> 03:35:09,050
I... I did it.

4970
03:35:10,330 --> 03:35:12,630
Did anyone else make it?

4971
03:35:15,030 --> 03:35:16,470
Done it.

4972
03:35:16,630 --> 03:35:17,350
Johnson?

4973
03:35:18,450 --> 03:35:19,550
What about Johnson?

4974
03:35:20,370 --> 03:35:21,310
We're all that's left.

4975
03:35:21,630 --> 03:35:21,910
No.

4976
03:35:23,250 --> 03:35:24,610
Sergeant Johnson.

4977
03:35:25,390 --> 03:35:25,650
For Earth.

4978
03:35:26,350 --> 03:35:28,690
an entire covenant armada obliterated.

4979
03:35:28,810 --> 03:35:29,270
And the flood.

4980
03:35:29,730 --> 03:35:31,070
We had no choice.

4981
03:35:31,650 --> 03:35:31,830
Oh.

4982
03:35:32,930 --> 03:35:33,310
Halo.

4983
03:35:33,910 --> 03:35:34,890
It's finished.

4984
03:35:35,310 --> 03:35:35,690
No.

4985
03:35:35,990 --> 03:35:36,630
That's not true.

4986
03:35:36,890 --> 03:35:37,670
I think we're just...

4987
03:35:37,670 --> 03:35:37,890
Seriously?

4988
03:35:38,710 --> 03:35:39,750
We're just kidding.

4989
03:35:40,010 --> 03:35:41,570
He took his helmet off!

4990
03:35:41,990 --> 03:35:42,490
John Halo!

4991
03:35:54,040 --> 03:35:55,260
Oh my god, good timing.

4992
03:35:57,480 --> 03:36:02,100
The food literally came just as he took off his helmet.

4993
03:36:07,730 --> 03:36:08,730
Oh my god.

4994
03:36:09,390 --> 03:36:10,650
Oh my god, we did it.

4995
03:36:11,110 --> 03:36:15,170
I still... I still can't believe a banshee hit me in the back.

4996
03:36:15,450 --> 03:36:17,270
And then my car flipped over.

4997
03:36:17,270 --> 03:36:19,610
And then it flipped over the bridge.

4998
03:36:19,830 --> 03:36:21,130
I can't...

4999
03:36:23,750 --> 03:36:25,990
I can't believe that happened.

5000
03:36:31,330 --> 03:36:32,830
Oh my god.

5001
03:36:41,770 --> 03:36:44,250
I got Halo backshot.

5002
03:36:44,250 --> 03:36:44,470
I got it.

5003
03:36:49,430 --> 03:36:51,490
It all worked out in the end.

5004
03:36:52,110 --> 03:36:53,250
Oh my god.

5005
03:36:53,690 --> 03:36:56,270
It all worked out in the end.

5006
03:36:57,030 --> 03:36:58,310
We did it.

5007
03:36:58,510 --> 03:37:00,950
We finally beat Halo 1.

5008
03:37:01,350 --> 03:37:02,250
Oh my god.

5009
03:37:02,390 --> 03:37:03,850
We're all there, guys.

5010
03:37:04,410 --> 03:37:05,790
We're all there.

5011
03:37:05,790 --> 03:37:08,290
One last backshot.

5012
03:37:09,370 --> 03:37:10,810
We were here.

5013
03:37:13,230 --> 03:37:15,570
Steven, thank you for the magenta soupa.

5014
03:37:16,390 --> 03:37:16,830
Thank you.

5015
03:37:16,990 --> 03:37:17,610
Thank you.

5016
03:37:18,090 --> 03:37:19,530
Good job, little bird.

5017
03:37:19,870 --> 03:37:21,390
Enjoy the rest of Halo.

5018
03:37:22,190 --> 03:37:22,810
Thank you.

5019
03:37:23,070 --> 03:37:25,050
Thank you for the magenta soupa.

5020
03:37:25,370 --> 03:37:25,830
Thank you.

5021
03:37:26,010 --> 03:37:26,670
Thank you.

5022
03:37:28,370 --> 03:37:30,010
Alright, let's swap.

5023
03:37:30,190 --> 03:37:32,410
Let's swap screens real quick.

5024
03:37:32,810 --> 03:37:33,810
Oh my god.

5025
03:37:34,030 --> 03:37:35,290
What a wild ride.

5026
03:37:35,670 --> 03:37:38,150
What a fucking wild ride.

5027
03:37:38,710 --> 03:37:40,270
Oh my god.

5028
03:37:41,890 --> 03:37:44,050
Let's swap here real quick.

5029
03:37:45,290 --> 03:37:45,950
Oh my god.

5030
03:37:46,070 --> 03:37:46,990
That was actually...

5031
03:37:46,990 --> 03:37:48,110
I'm so...

5032
03:37:48,110 --> 03:37:49,530
That was so fucked up.

5033
03:37:51,250 --> 03:37:53,650
Oh wait, that's not the right one.

5034
03:37:55,790 --> 03:37:57,190
That's the cowboy one.

5035
03:37:57,590 --> 03:37:59,070
That was so fucked up.

5036
03:37:59,190 --> 03:37:59,850
I'm not gonna lie.

5037
03:38:02,010 --> 03:38:03,950
Let me put the gun down.

5038
03:38:04,130 --> 03:38:04,670
It's over.

5039
03:38:05,550 --> 03:38:06,610
It's over.

5040
03:38:06,910 --> 03:38:07,650
Let's grab...

5041
03:38:07,650 --> 03:38:09,370
Grab the beach ball.

5042
03:38:09,750 --> 03:38:11,490
Put on the shirt.

5043
03:38:11,870 --> 03:38:14,170
It's time for my vacation.

5044
03:38:14,530 --> 03:38:15,110
Aloha.

5045
03:38:17,750 --> 03:38:18,430
Right?

5046
03:38:20,210 --> 03:38:25,690
It's right after, you know, when we fucking beat Halo 1.

5047
03:38:26,050 --> 03:38:31,830
John, Halo, and Cortana goes to the beach back to find space Hawaii.

5048
03:38:36,830 --> 03:38:40,270
John, Halo, and Cortana at the beach right now.

5049
03:38:40,470 --> 03:38:42,050
We're having our beach episode.

5050
03:38:44,250 --> 03:38:45,630
I'm just happy.

5051
03:38:45,950 --> 03:38:47,490
I'm happy we beat...

5052
03:38:47,490 --> 03:38:49,310
Yeah, it's straight to vacation time.

5053
03:38:53,170 --> 03:38:57,570
John, Halo, and Speedo, and Cortana, and Bikini.

5054
03:38:57,870 --> 03:38:59,550
And we're living the good life.

5055
03:39:00,270 --> 03:39:02,270
But yes, we finally finished.

5056
03:39:03,130 --> 03:39:05,190
Finally finished Halo 1.

5057
03:39:05,410 --> 03:39:09,130
I'm looking forward to try the rest of the Halo series in the future.

5058
03:39:09,130 --> 03:39:10,090
Yeah, Beach Party.

5059
03:39:10,190 --> 03:39:12,270
Beach Party with John Halo, guys!

5060
03:39:12,750 --> 03:39:13,330
Let's go!

5061
03:39:15,370 --> 03:39:17,290
Yes, I will be playing Halo 2.

5062
03:39:17,370 --> 03:39:20,270
I'm going to play Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo Reach.

5063
03:39:20,430 --> 03:39:22,430
Apparently, that's, like, the order I should be playing.

5064
03:39:22,430 --> 03:39:28,790
Um, we're not going to go beyond 3 because, apparently, after 3 is not a good time.

5065
03:39:29,330 --> 03:39:40,090
Um, Halo 3, um, I was approached by Zentreya if, like, that she really, really wanted me to play multiplayer on Halo 3.

5066
03:39:40,090 --> 03:39:41,870
Because I was just going to do a solo run.

5067
03:39:42,290 --> 03:39:50,110
Um, but Zen messaged me and said that, uh, if Halo 3 has to be played with multiplayer.

5068
03:39:50,670 --> 03:39:51,730
And I was like, wait, really?

5069
03:39:51,830 --> 03:39:52,690
Apparently, I don't know.

5070
03:39:52,910 --> 03:39:54,110
Is that, is that true?

5071
03:39:54,570 --> 03:39:57,670
Halo 3 is meant to be, like, a four-player game.

5072
03:39:57,670 --> 03:40:07,030
Because, apparently, yeah, apparently, like, um, um, two of the characters in Halo 3, um, is, like, part of the story.

5073
03:40:07,570 --> 03:40:14,330
So, like, Zen said, like, when I start Halo 3, she wants me to get into a four-stack with her and, like, two other people.

5074
03:40:14,870 --> 03:40:18,270
Um, to, to experience the campaign.

5075
03:40:18,430 --> 03:40:20,270
And that there is friendly fire.

5076
03:40:20,590 --> 03:40:21,850
And, like, I'm scared.

5077
03:40:21,850 --> 03:40:29,750
I, I, I, because the amount of times I died to my own nades and the enemy nades.

5078
03:40:29,890 --> 03:40:38,930
And now, I have to be aware of, I have to be aware of my teammates' nades.

5079
03:40:39,050 --> 03:40:41,710
So, there is friendly fire.

5080
03:40:42,130 --> 03:40:42,390
Yeah.

5081
03:40:42,650 --> 03:40:44,730
You should be scared.

5082
03:40:45,110 --> 03:40:47,070
In my own car.

5083
03:40:47,730 --> 03:40:50,210
But anyways, um, for Halo 3, it will be multiplayer.

5084
03:40:50,210 --> 03:40:52,510
Uh, friend, thank you for the magenta super.

5085
03:40:52,730 --> 03:40:53,010
Thank you.

5086
03:40:53,110 --> 03:40:53,710
Thank you.

5087
03:40:54,270 --> 03:40:56,690
Uh, congratulations, Doki, for completing Halo.

5088
03:40:56,810 --> 03:40:59,130
Now, do Halo 2 on Lasso.

5089
03:40:59,170 --> 03:40:59,850
What's Lasso?

5090
03:41:00,390 --> 03:41:02,430
Uh, Netbase, thank you for the magenta super.

5091
03:41:02,770 --> 03:41:03,070
Thank you.

5092
03:41:03,190 --> 03:41:03,730
Thank you.

5093
03:41:04,110 --> 03:41:08,210
Now, you just need to host a LAN party with mid to complete the Halo 1 experience.

5094
03:41:08,550 --> 03:41:10,130
Thank you for the magenta super.

5095
03:41:10,490 --> 03:41:10,830
Thank you.

5096
03:41:10,950 --> 03:41:11,430
Thank you.

5097
03:41:11,730 --> 03:41:14,650
Lauren Lincoln, um, Arcturus, thank you for the super chat.

5098
03:41:14,870 --> 03:41:15,050
Thank you.

5099
03:41:15,410 --> 03:41:16,350
Uh, wait.

5100
03:41:16,410 --> 03:41:19,330
Let me grab my food real quick before I do the rest of the donation reading.

5101
03:41:19,330 --> 03:41:20,310
I'll be right back, guys.

5102
03:41:51,070 --> 03:41:52,150
Ah, I got food.

5103
03:41:52,350 --> 03:41:55,290
Okay, let me get my food out real quick, guys.

5104
03:41:55,630 --> 03:41:55,630
Ooh.

5105
03:41:56,210 --> 03:41:57,490
Dad knows I got food, too.

5106
03:41:57,730 --> 03:41:58,750
He's like, food?

5107
03:41:59,490 --> 03:42:04,290
You heard the sound of... Yeah.

5108
03:42:08,270 --> 03:42:09,450
I know you know.

5109
03:42:09,730 --> 03:42:11,210
Oh, I don't know if I got utensils.

5110
03:42:12,370 --> 03:42:15,210
I forgot to request utensils.

5111
03:42:15,330 --> 03:42:15,650
I hate it.

5112
03:42:15,850 --> 03:42:16,190
I hate that.

5113
03:42:16,350 --> 03:42:17,710
I always forget to request utensils.

5114
03:42:23,530 --> 03:42:24,510
All right, give me a sec.

5115
03:42:24,930 --> 03:42:27,070
I gotta... I gotta grab utensils.

5116
03:42:27,190 --> 03:42:27,650
He's like, food?

5117
03:42:27,650 --> 03:42:28,230
For me?

5118
03:42:28,370 --> 03:42:29,470
No, it's not for you.

5119
03:42:30,110 --> 03:42:31,470
Dad, it's not for you.

5120
03:42:33,550 --> 03:42:33,950
Okay.

5121
03:42:35,850 --> 03:42:36,670
Give me a sec.

5122
03:42:39,450 --> 03:42:40,410
It's just annoying.

5123
03:42:40,630 --> 03:42:44,590
It's just annoying to have to, like, you know... I'll be right back.

5124
03:42:45,450 --> 03:42:46,290
I'll be right back.

5125
03:42:46,490 --> 03:42:47,550
I'm grabbing utensils.

5126
03:43:03,030 --> 03:43:03,550
Okay.

5127
03:43:03,550 --> 03:43:04,190
All right.

5128
03:43:04,450 --> 03:43:04,650
Yay!

5129
03:43:05,510 --> 03:43:05,890
Okay.

5130
03:43:06,850 --> 03:43:09,010
I'll nom a bit while I do super chat reading.

5131
03:43:09,750 --> 03:43:11,750
Um, I got carpaccio, too.

5132
03:43:12,170 --> 03:43:13,090
I love carpaccio.

5133
03:43:13,750 --> 03:43:13,990
Yeah.

5134
03:43:15,290 --> 03:43:19,750
Um, but, um... Hmm.

5135
03:43:21,790 --> 03:43:22,970
Putting the sauce on.

5136
03:43:26,550 --> 03:43:27,650
That was fun, though.

5137
03:43:27,870 --> 03:43:29,050
For my first Halo experience.

5138
03:43:29,770 --> 03:43:30,810
It was really fun.

5139
03:43:32,610 --> 03:43:34,910
Um... Guys, I... I know how to crouch jump.

5140
03:43:35,010 --> 03:43:35,910
I was just so mad.

5141
03:43:36,050 --> 03:43:36,850
I was so angry.

5142
03:43:37,370 --> 03:43:37,510
I...

5143
03:43:42,790 --> 03:43:44,050
I don't understand.

5144
03:43:45,030 --> 03:43:46,630
I couldn't...

5145
03:43:47,650 --> 03:43:50,610
My brain was never... Not thinking anymore.

5146
03:43:50,790 --> 03:43:51,790
I was just so mad.

5147
03:43:53,970 --> 03:43:55,390
He's not thinking about super chat.

5148
03:43:55,490 --> 03:43:55,770
Thank you.

5149
03:43:56,010 --> 03:43:56,390
Thank you.

5150
03:43:56,930 --> 03:43:58,630
I'm too angry with jump.

5151
03:43:58,930 --> 03:44:00,250
I was so angry.

5152
03:44:03,490 --> 03:44:04,070
Um... Um... Imposter.

5153
03:44:04,170 --> 03:44:05,310
You didn't even super chat, didn't you think?

5154
03:44:05,530 --> 03:44:05,630
Yeah.

5155
03:44:07,130 --> 03:44:14,530
Well, Joki, now that you've finished Halo 1, are you completing you in Halo 2 or are you trying to curse Halo for the dragoons and make people laugh their lungs out?

5156
03:44:14,550 --> 03:44:15,230
What's curse Halo?

5157
03:44:19,430 --> 03:44:23,010
I saw a lot of people suggesting it, but I don't know why it is.

5158
03:44:28,280 --> 03:44:29,020
It's so funny.

5159
03:44:29,220 --> 03:44:30,760
Yeah, okay, but what... What does it do?

5160
03:44:31,480 --> 03:44:33,080
But, like, how is it funny?

5161
03:44:42,050 --> 03:44:46,050
You're not... Maybe I'll do curse Halo at the... Like, at the end of all the series.

5162
03:44:46,050 --> 03:44:47,010
As, like, a bonus.

5163
03:44:47,510 --> 03:44:47,990
You know?

5164
03:44:48,090 --> 03:44:48,870
Like, bonus run.

5165
03:44:50,290 --> 03:44:51,250
Like, an encore.

5166
03:44:53,630 --> 03:44:55,010
I don't know what it's for.

5167
03:44:55,730 --> 03:44:57,290
Oh, I think it's for my fried rice.

5168
03:44:57,870 --> 03:44:58,230
Maybe?

5169
03:44:59,010 --> 03:44:59,430
I don't know.

5170
03:44:59,890 --> 03:45:00,290
What is it?

5171
03:45:00,570 --> 03:45:01,470
Oh, they did me!

5172
03:45:01,570 --> 03:45:02,550
Oh, no, that's not...

5173
03:45:02,550 --> 03:45:03,270
Just JK.

5174
03:45:03,910 --> 03:45:03,930
Ooh.

5175
03:45:05,950 --> 03:45:06,770
Okay, let me...

5176
03:45:08,750 --> 03:45:09,610
Y'all evil?

5177
03:45:09,830 --> 03:45:11,350
Wait, I thought you guys said it was fun.

5178
03:45:11,590 --> 03:45:14,330
Why did this guy say that you guys are evil?

5179
03:45:16,090 --> 03:45:17,630
Do you mean fun for you guys?

5180
03:45:19,130 --> 03:45:20,350
And not fun for me?

5181
03:45:20,650 --> 03:45:21,490
Is that it?

5182
03:45:22,050 --> 03:45:22,970
I knew it.

5183
03:45:23,870 --> 03:45:26,290
It is fun for the audience.

5184
03:45:26,610 --> 03:45:27,150
Is that it?

5185
03:45:33,010 --> 03:45:34,470
Fun and evil.

5186
03:45:37,010 --> 03:45:38,750
Um, Wings, thank you for the super chat.

5187
03:45:38,830 --> 03:45:39,270
Thank you, thank you.

5188
03:45:39,310 --> 03:45:40,790
You don't need to play any of the story co-op.

5189
03:45:41,010 --> 03:45:43,310
And the characters actually have unique actions and dialogue.

5190
03:45:43,550 --> 03:45:45,610
You're not missing much if you are co-op.

5191
03:45:45,610 --> 03:45:46,970
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

5192
03:45:47,090 --> 03:45:47,850
Thank you, thank you.

5193
03:45:49,030 --> 03:45:50,530
Um, Nineball, thank you for the super chat.

5194
03:45:50,650 --> 03:45:51,390
Thank you, thank you.

5195
03:45:51,850 --> 03:45:53,170
Crisela is on the Steam Workshop.

5196
03:45:53,370 --> 03:45:54,670
So installation is like, oh, that's good.

5197
03:45:54,870 --> 03:45:55,970
I like it when things are easy.

5198
03:45:59,630 --> 03:46:00,910
I don't want to think too much.

5199
03:46:04,630 --> 03:46:06,250
I want to ask when's the next collab.

5200
03:46:06,410 --> 03:46:07,130
Literally next week.

5201
03:46:07,650 --> 03:46:11,530
I've been lining up collabs for like, um, at least one, like every week.

5202
03:46:14,270 --> 03:46:15,290
There's one collab.

5203
03:46:17,350 --> 03:46:18,050
Every week.

5204
03:46:19,270 --> 03:46:23,870
I'm trying to, I'm trying to be like, old Doki again, where I did lots of collabs.

5205
03:46:23,870 --> 03:46:28,030
But I didn't do that recently for a while because I was so fucking busy.

5206
03:46:28,270 --> 03:46:30,290
Because I'm always the one organizing it.

5207
03:46:31,190 --> 03:46:32,830
Um, I really get invited.

5208
03:46:34,070 --> 03:46:39,830
Because like, I think like VTubers are very, a lot of VTubers are like super introverted and stuff.

5209
03:46:39,830 --> 03:46:41,670
And usually they don't want to...

5210
03:46:43,610 --> 03:46:48,290
It's hard for them to like, go outside their own like, circle.

5211
03:46:48,950 --> 03:46:50,030
Which is understandable.

5212
03:46:50,450 --> 03:46:54,470
Because, um, um, it's always hard to like, make the first step.

5213
03:46:55,070 --> 03:47:00,950
So like, that's why you tend to see like, a lot of like, the groups would stay within the group and stuff.

5214
03:47:02,310 --> 03:47:05,390
So like, yeah, take the first step.

5215
03:47:06,410 --> 03:47:10,690
So like, usually I'm the one reaching out to make these collabs happen.

5216
03:47:11,410 --> 03:47:13,630
That's why like, recently I wasn't doing that.

5217
03:47:13,830 --> 03:47:16,970
Like, I wasn't like, reaching out to people for collabing and stuff.

5218
03:47:17,110 --> 03:47:19,330
And that's why like, we didn't have collabs for a while now.

5219
03:47:21,890 --> 03:47:22,330
Hmm.

5220
03:47:23,390 --> 03:47:25,150
But like, I have time again, you know?

5221
03:47:26,150 --> 03:47:27,110
After hell month.

5222
03:47:28,970 --> 03:47:33,070
After a while to go through, um, with the concert and everything, that's over.

5223
03:47:33,450 --> 03:47:36,070
I have a lot more time now, to like, do that stuff.

5224
03:47:40,210 --> 03:47:42,790
No, I collab with, I don't just collab with VTubers.

5225
03:47:42,950 --> 03:47:44,450
I collab with Fleshtubers, you know?

5226
03:47:46,030 --> 03:47:48,870
Um, Fleshtubers are actually like, the people who love to ask me.

5227
03:47:48,930 --> 03:47:51,630
Like, I think Fleshtubers, since a lot of them are like, super extroverted.

5228
03:47:52,290 --> 03:47:52,870
That's weird.

5229
03:47:54,030 --> 03:47:55,690
VTubers, they're more introverts than they are.

5230
03:47:55,870 --> 03:47:58,710
They're like, VTubers, there's a lot of introverts for VTubing.

5231
03:47:58,710 --> 03:48:03,250
But for Fleshtubers, the majority of them are usually like, extroverted people.

5232
03:48:03,530 --> 03:48:06,530
And they're always like, asking me, asking people for collabs and stuff like that.

5233
03:48:06,610 --> 03:48:08,890
Because they're always doing stuff like IRL, shit like that.

5234
03:48:09,550 --> 03:48:10,690
They do like, IRL stuff.

5235
03:48:11,090 --> 03:48:15,390
They do like, um, always interacting with other streamers and stuff like that.

5236
03:48:16,110 --> 03:48:16,290
Um.

5237
03:48:20,240 --> 03:48:21,620
I do do a lot of stuff.

5238
03:48:21,800 --> 03:48:25,400
But when I do get invited, invited to things, it's mostly from the Fleshtubers.

5239
03:48:25,400 --> 03:48:27,480
Because they're all very, like, extroverted people.

5240
03:48:30,220 --> 03:48:30,660
Um.

5241
03:48:30,880 --> 03:48:32,100
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

5242
03:48:32,200 --> 03:48:33,020
Thank you, thank you.

5243
03:48:36,610 --> 03:48:40,430
Blasto stands for Legendary Difficulty All Skulls On.

5244
03:48:40,510 --> 03:48:43,870
You should see what skulls do in Halo to understand why this is a game type.

5245
03:48:44,230 --> 03:48:46,530
Usually play this in four-player co-op.

5246
03:48:46,870 --> 03:48:48,250
Uh, didn't, no, Sen did not.

5247
03:48:48,470 --> 03:48:50,730
Sen just said, whenever I start Halo 3.

5248
03:48:51,190 --> 03:48:54,550
Like, whenever I finish Halo 2, to just like, tell her about it.

5249
03:48:54,670 --> 03:48:55,710
And she was like, set up a collab.

5250
03:48:55,710 --> 03:48:57,830
Because I told her, like, oh, I'm still...

5251
03:48:57,830 --> 03:49:00,410
I still have Halo 1 and 2 to finish and stuff.

5252
03:49:00,530 --> 03:49:03,070
So I don't know when I'll be playing Halo 3 yet.

5253
03:49:03,250 --> 03:49:05,350
But she was like, okay, just let me know later.

5254
03:49:05,890 --> 03:49:07,350
Uh, thank you for the super chat, Wings.

5255
03:49:07,430 --> 03:49:08,110
Thank you, thank you.

5256
03:49:09,670 --> 03:49:10,030
Um.

5257
03:49:10,490 --> 03:49:11,030
Of course.

5258
03:49:11,250 --> 03:49:12,630
Thank you for the Akasupa.

5259
03:49:13,010 --> 03:49:13,930
Thank you, thank you.

5260
03:49:14,650 --> 03:49:17,410
This game was part of my childhood and you engaged with it perfectly.

5261
03:49:17,690 --> 03:49:21,450
You reacted to the story beats and fell for the dev's traps.

5262
03:49:21,670 --> 03:49:23,070
Not just point A to B.

5263
03:49:23,070 --> 03:49:26,730
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making this journey nostalgic and enjoyable and fresh.

5264
03:49:26,850 --> 03:49:27,350
Thank you.

5265
03:49:27,450 --> 03:49:28,610
Thank you for the Akasupa.

5266
03:49:28,910 --> 03:49:29,110
Thank you.

5267
03:49:31,290 --> 03:49:33,290
Yeah, that's why I wanted to do this series.

5268
03:49:33,610 --> 03:49:36,890
Because, like, Halo was something I've always wanted to play for the longest time.

5269
03:49:37,110 --> 03:49:39,410
Um, I never had perms before in the before times.

5270
03:49:39,910 --> 03:49:41,710
Um, because, like, I don't know.

5271
03:49:41,850 --> 03:49:43,870
Microsoft just never gave perms out.

5272
03:49:44,150 --> 03:49:45,870
Um, so, I was super...

5273
03:49:45,870 --> 03:49:47,250
I think they just didn't...

5274
03:49:47,250 --> 03:49:47,910
They didn't care.

5275
03:49:48,570 --> 03:49:50,590
Because Microsoft was like, why the fuck are you asking about perms?

5276
03:49:50,590 --> 03:49:51,630
Just play the game, you know?

5277
03:49:52,670 --> 03:49:58,770
Um, so, I'm really happy to actually be able to try Halo.

5278
03:49:58,990 --> 03:50:03,250
And I know, like, people always love watching, like, you know, first time experience.

5279
03:50:03,570 --> 03:50:04,590
Like, it's very rare.

5280
03:50:04,690 --> 03:50:06,330
It's very rare to be...

5281
03:50:06,330 --> 03:50:11,530
It's very rare to find, I guess, like, a streamer that's never played Halo before.

5282
03:50:12,030 --> 03:50:15,690
Um, especially, like, an FPS, like, streamer in general.

5283
03:50:15,690 --> 03:50:19,650
Because a lot of, like, you know, a lot of people who play FPS games grew up with Halo.

5284
03:50:19,970 --> 03:50:21,510
Or, like, no, like, grew up with Halo.

5285
03:50:21,870 --> 03:50:22,850
And, like, played Halo.

5286
03:50:23,070 --> 03:50:24,890
A lot of them came from Halo games.

5287
03:50:25,110 --> 03:50:28,730
But I was, like, the rare ones that didn't because my dad was a Sony boy.

5288
03:50:29,010 --> 03:50:32,090
So, I never got a chance to grow up with Halo at all.

5289
03:50:32,450 --> 03:50:36,410
So, um, it was all a new experience for me in general because of it.

5290
03:50:37,470 --> 03:50:38,170
Mm-hmm.

5291
03:50:40,350 --> 03:50:43,470
It's very rare to have those type of experience.

5292
03:50:43,730 --> 03:50:44,390
So, you're like, whoa!

5293
03:50:45,090 --> 03:50:47,890
Like, you know, I never really knew the plot point of Halo.

5294
03:50:48,310 --> 03:50:50,630
I just knew Cortana and John Halo.

5295
03:50:51,970 --> 03:50:56,570
I just knew, like, you know, the main character is that guy in the green armor.

5296
03:50:56,810 --> 03:50:57,290
And that's...

5297
03:50:57,870 --> 03:50:59,750
And then Cortana is the AI.

5298
03:51:00,210 --> 03:51:01,730
That's literally my knowledge of Halo.

5299
03:51:04,510 --> 03:51:05,490
That's all I knew.

5300
03:51:05,490 --> 03:51:06,870
And now I know more.

5301
03:51:07,010 --> 03:51:08,470
Now I know about the fucking flood.

5302
03:51:10,870 --> 03:51:12,830
Never knew about the fucking zombies.

5303
03:51:13,330 --> 03:51:15,470
Nobody told me about the zombies.

5304
03:51:15,470 --> 03:51:20,210
I thought that would be a very important thing that people would tell others about.

5305
03:51:20,670 --> 03:51:21,870
Apparently, it was not.

5306
03:51:22,110 --> 03:51:23,230
I was like, what the...

5307
03:51:23,830 --> 03:51:25,510
There's zombies in Halo?

5308
03:51:25,590 --> 03:51:28,290
I was so surprised when I first encountered it.

5309
03:51:28,310 --> 03:51:31,370
I was like, why the fuck did no one ever talk about the zombies?

5310
03:51:33,850 --> 03:51:34,490
Wap-up.

5311
03:51:35,710 --> 03:51:36,510
Wap-up.

5312
03:51:36,510 --> 03:51:37,350
Thank you for the super chat.

5313
03:51:37,570 --> 03:51:37,830
Thank you.

5314
03:51:37,990 --> 03:51:38,390
Thank you.

5315
03:51:38,590 --> 03:51:40,390
Definitely play Halo 2 in remastered graphics.

5316
03:51:40,810 --> 03:51:42,950
Those cutscenes feel like you're definitely watching a movie.

5317
03:51:43,070 --> 03:51:43,670
Oh, is that...

5318
03:51:43,670 --> 03:51:45,310
Is Halo 2 cutscenes better?

5319
03:51:45,590 --> 03:51:48,950
Like, the graphics better for Halo 1?

5320
03:51:50,110 --> 03:51:53,470
Like, I like how I used the remastered graphics as, like, a flashlight.

5321
03:51:54,810 --> 03:51:55,790
When it's too dark.

5322
03:51:58,370 --> 03:52:00,050
I'm like, it's a mechanic, okay?

5323
03:52:02,410 --> 03:52:04,730
I was like, I can't see it.

5324
03:52:05,150 --> 03:52:05,890
Flashlight...

5325
03:52:05,890 --> 03:52:07,190
Flashlight on.

5326
03:52:09,500 --> 03:52:11,190
Let me change the graphics.

5327
03:52:15,680 --> 03:52:16,420
Um...

5328
03:52:16,420 --> 03:52:18,240
Oh, this fried rice is so good, though.

5329
03:52:18,360 --> 03:52:19,060
Oh my gosh.

5330
03:52:19,800 --> 03:52:20,480
That's like...

5331
03:52:20,480 --> 03:52:21,600
Crab in it, too.

5332
03:52:21,800 --> 03:52:22,500
It's so good.

5333
03:52:22,700 --> 03:52:23,120
Oh, wow.

5334
03:52:24,460 --> 03:52:27,180
It gave me, like, extra sauce, but I don't know what it's for.

5335
03:52:29,300 --> 03:52:30,720
I don't know what this is for.

5336
03:52:31,080 --> 03:52:33,000
I don't know if it's for my beef carpaccio.

5337
03:52:33,720 --> 03:52:34,900
I don't think so.

5338
03:52:37,540 --> 03:52:37,980
Um...

5339
03:52:37,980 --> 03:52:39,340
Josh, thank you for the super chat.

5340
03:52:39,440 --> 03:52:39,620
Thank you.

5341
03:52:39,760 --> 03:52:40,260
Thank you.

5342
03:52:41,660 --> 03:52:44,540
Will you be playing, uh...

5343
03:52:44,540 --> 03:52:45,080
Let me...

5344
03:52:45,080 --> 03:52:45,280
Sorry.

5345
03:52:45,460 --> 03:52:47,700
Let me eat first, before I read your super chat.

5346
03:52:47,880 --> 03:52:48,620
Because I'm hungry.

5347
03:52:49,120 --> 03:52:50,220
I'm just so hungry.

5348
03:52:51,880 --> 03:52:52,320
Hmm.

5349
03:52:57,810 --> 03:52:59,410
Josh, thank you for the super chat.

5350
03:52:59,510 --> 03:52:59,730
Thank you.

5351
03:52:59,850 --> 03:53:00,350
Thank you.

5352
03:53:01,130 --> 03:53:02,590
Will you be playing Halo 3?

5353
03:53:03,430 --> 03:53:04,310
Um, ODST?

5354
03:53:04,610 --> 03:53:05,290
What's ODST?

5355
03:53:06,190 --> 03:53:08,030
It takes place between 2 and 3.

5356
03:53:09,190 --> 03:53:09,670
And...

5357
03:53:09,670 --> 03:53:11,390
In the city introduced into...

5358
03:53:11,390 --> 03:53:12,170
It has a really good story.

5359
03:53:12,630 --> 03:53:14,050
I'll play all the Halos that are good.

5360
03:53:15,210 --> 03:53:17,530
Like, whatever you guys think is a good Halo.

5361
03:53:17,690 --> 03:53:18,330
I'll play it.

5362
03:53:18,470 --> 03:53:19,930
And I'll just avoid the bad Halo.

5363
03:53:20,930 --> 03:53:23,030
One other game I really want to do...

5364
03:53:23,030 --> 03:53:23,930
After Halo...

5365
03:53:23,930 --> 03:53:24,710
Not after Halo.

5366
03:53:25,370 --> 03:53:26,050
Actually, no.

5367
03:53:26,330 --> 03:53:28,190
After I complete the Halo series...

5368
03:53:29,790 --> 03:53:30,270
Um...

5369
03:53:30,270 --> 03:53:32,350
I want to play Gears of War.

5370
03:53:32,690 --> 03:53:33,690
Because I never...

5371
03:53:33,690 --> 03:53:34,370
Um...

5372
03:53:34,370 --> 03:53:36,910
I sort of grew up with Gears of War.

5373
03:53:37,190 --> 03:53:37,970
But, like...

5374
03:53:37,970 --> 03:53:41,190
It's mostly me watching my dad play Gears of War.

5375
03:53:41,530 --> 03:53:42,930
But I know you have to...

5376
03:53:42,930 --> 03:53:44,670
Do you have to play Gears of War co-op?

5377
03:53:44,830 --> 03:53:46,050
To experience it fully?

5378
03:53:46,350 --> 03:53:47,310
Or is it better...

5379
03:53:47,310 --> 03:53:48,330
Or is it better solo?

5380
03:53:48,630 --> 03:53:49,230
I don't know.

5381
03:53:50,650 --> 03:53:51,270
But, like...

5382
03:53:51,270 --> 03:53:52,670
But, like...

5383
03:53:53,430 --> 03:53:54,090
Gears of War.

5384
03:53:54,150 --> 03:53:55,870
I watched my dad play it growing up.

5385
03:53:59,310 --> 03:54:01,410
So, that's something I want to do after...

5386
03:54:01,850 --> 03:54:03,470
That's something I want to do...

5387
03:54:04,550 --> 03:54:04,910
After...

5388
03:54:05,850 --> 03:54:06,210
Uh...

5389
03:54:06,210 --> 03:54:08,050
After finishing the Halo series.

5390
03:54:12,940 --> 03:54:13,600
Both are gay.

5391
03:54:14,580 --> 03:54:17,000
I know my dad would let me play co-op with him sometimes.

5392
03:54:17,240 --> 03:54:18,040
But he, like...

5393
03:54:18,980 --> 03:54:20,420
But not all the time.

5394
03:54:21,340 --> 03:54:22,500
And he preferred solo.

5395
03:54:22,760 --> 03:54:23,900
So he doesn't have to wait for me...

5396
03:54:23,900 --> 03:54:24,760
To get off school.

5397
03:54:31,260 --> 03:54:33,320
He just mostly played solo.

5398
03:54:34,500 --> 03:54:35,420
He's like...

5399
03:54:35,420 --> 03:54:36,160
Stupid daughter.

5400
03:54:36,580 --> 03:54:37,740
Having a good school.

5401
03:54:38,040 --> 03:54:39,920
I want to play my Gears of War.

5402
03:54:54,010 --> 03:54:55,590
Yeah, I gotta play with him sometimes.

5403
03:54:55,850 --> 03:54:57,810
I know I didn't play a lot of the co-op.

5404
03:54:58,050 --> 03:54:59,630
I mostly watched him play it.

5405
03:55:00,630 --> 03:55:01,710
I'm not too much of a gamer.

5406
03:55:06,800 --> 03:55:07,160
Jakarta.

5407
03:55:07,300 --> 03:55:08,080
Thank you for the super chat.

5408
03:55:08,220 --> 03:55:08,420
Thank you.

5409
03:55:08,480 --> 03:55:08,880
Thank you.

5410
03:55:10,140 --> 03:55:12,440
Besides Halo 2, 3, and Reach...

5411
03:55:12,440 --> 03:55:14,740
It should also be worth noting that there's also Halo...

5412
03:55:14,740 --> 03:55:15,000
Oh, yeah.

5413
03:55:15,380 --> 03:55:15,700
No, no.

5414
03:55:15,700 --> 03:55:16,540
Halo DST.

5415
03:55:17,280 --> 03:55:18,480
Taking place between...

5416
03:55:18,480 --> 03:55:19,900
And still a good bunchy Halo.

5417
03:55:20,080 --> 03:55:20,700
But a short game.

5418
03:55:21,000 --> 03:55:21,760
Thank you for the super chat.

5419
03:55:21,860 --> 03:55:22,040
Thank you.

5420
03:55:22,160 --> 03:55:22,620
Thank you.

5421
03:55:23,120 --> 03:55:23,700
Mad Rad.

5422
03:55:24,440 --> 03:55:25,440
Thank you for the super chat.

5423
03:55:25,540 --> 03:55:25,760
Thank you.

5424
03:55:25,860 --> 03:55:26,380
Thank you.

5425
03:55:27,520 --> 03:55:28,260
For real, though.

5426
03:55:28,340 --> 03:55:29,820
The Flood is such a badass name.

5427
03:55:29,820 --> 03:55:35,460
When I saw people talking about the flood before we got there, I thought they were talking about, like, an actual flood.

5428
03:55:35,700 --> 03:55:36,480
Like, you know.

5429
03:55:36,940 --> 03:55:38,040
I thought I was like, oh, shit.

5430
03:55:38,120 --> 03:55:40,420
Is water just gonna fucking try and drown me or something?

5431
03:55:40,680 --> 03:55:42,900
Like, I was like, oh, the rainforest.

5432
03:55:42,900 --> 03:55:44,760
Oh, that's where the flood's gonna be.

5433
03:55:44,900 --> 03:55:47,640
Because, like, the flood is gonna be, like, you know.

5434
03:55:47,940 --> 03:55:48,600
I don't know.

5435
03:55:48,720 --> 03:55:51,280
Like, I'm just gonna get flooded by water or some shit.

5436
03:55:51,340 --> 03:55:52,740
Or I thought it was a map.

5437
03:55:53,760 --> 03:55:55,260
Like, an actual flood?

5438
03:55:56,440 --> 03:55:57,160
Or, like...

5439
03:55:58,100 --> 03:55:59,820
Or, like, a map or something.

5440
03:56:00,020 --> 03:56:01,360
Like, oh, like, oh, yeah.

5441
03:56:01,360 --> 03:56:02,680
Wait till she gets the flood.

5442
03:56:02,680 --> 03:56:04,180
And I'm like, oh, the chapter name?

5443
03:56:04,340 --> 03:56:04,800
The Flood?

5444
03:56:04,800 --> 03:56:09,900
Like, it's like, I wonder what happens in the chapter of The Flood.

5445
03:56:11,420 --> 03:56:13,280
I wonder what happens.

5446
03:56:13,600 --> 03:56:16,180
But no one fucking hit it with fucking zombies.

5447
03:56:21,400 --> 03:56:23,160
All right, thank you for the Super Chat.

5448
03:56:23,240 --> 03:56:23,760
Thank you.

5449
03:56:23,800 --> 03:56:25,140
There's also the Halo Wars game.

5450
03:56:25,300 --> 03:56:26,800
Oh, is that not the RTS one?

5451
03:56:26,800 --> 03:56:27,780
I talked about it.

5452
03:56:27,860 --> 03:56:29,740
That was the only Halo game my dad played.

5453
03:56:30,960 --> 03:56:34,280
Because he got an Xbox 360, finally, for Gears of War.

5454
03:56:34,800 --> 03:56:37,000
And I watched him play the Halo War...

5455
03:56:37,000 --> 03:56:38,840
Like, the RTS game of Halo.

5456
03:56:45,370 --> 03:56:47,150
I wish RTS wasn't good.

5457
03:56:49,150 --> 03:56:50,970
I wish RTS didn't die.

5458
03:56:53,390 --> 03:56:55,510
Then I'd stream StarCraft.

5459
03:56:56,350 --> 03:56:57,350
That's for the story, though.

5460
03:56:57,590 --> 03:56:59,150
I just love the story of StarCraft.

5461
03:57:05,230 --> 03:57:06,510
I think StarCraft...

5462
03:57:06,510 --> 03:57:08,130
I know, like, people have mixed...

5463
03:57:08,130 --> 03:57:09,110
Mixed...

5464
03:57:09,730 --> 03:57:10,290
Um...

5465
03:57:10,290 --> 03:57:12,190
Have mixed reception with StarCraft, too.

5466
03:57:12,190 --> 03:57:12,370
Nope.

5467
03:57:12,710 --> 03:57:13,430
But I cried.

5468
03:57:13,750 --> 03:57:14,810
When I played it.

5469
03:57:15,130 --> 03:57:15,890
At the ending.

5470
03:57:16,090 --> 03:57:17,150
When everything was over.

5471
03:57:17,470 --> 03:57:18,850
I actually fucking cried.

5472
03:57:19,590 --> 03:57:21,530
I thought it was a great ending.

5473
03:57:21,710 --> 03:57:23,110
But I also was really young.

5474
03:57:23,690 --> 03:57:24,830
I don't know.

5475
03:57:25,530 --> 03:57:26,970
Maybe I just didn't know better.

5476
03:57:27,990 --> 03:57:28,930
But I was like...

5477
03:57:28,930 --> 03:57:30,130
I waited so long.

5478
03:57:30,310 --> 03:57:30,750
I was like...

5479
03:57:30,750 --> 03:57:32,410
I waited so long for this...

5480
03:57:32,410 --> 03:57:34,430
For StarCraft 2 to come out.

5481
03:57:36,870 --> 03:57:37,670
That, like...

5482
03:57:37,670 --> 03:57:38,970
I was just willing...

5483
03:57:38,970 --> 03:57:39,410
I...

5484
03:57:39,410 --> 03:57:41,270
Like, anything was good to me.

5485
03:57:41,670 --> 03:57:42,090
And...

5486
03:57:44,470 --> 03:57:45,130
Don't worry.

5487
03:57:45,250 --> 03:57:46,570
I will stream Brood Wars.

5488
03:57:46,770 --> 03:57:47,450
Yes, I will.

5489
03:57:47,590 --> 03:57:47,970
One day.

5490
03:57:51,990 --> 03:57:52,430
Yeah.

5491
03:57:53,230 --> 03:57:54,110
I thought...

5492
03:57:54,110 --> 03:57:54,770
I thought...

5493
03:57:54,770 --> 03:57:55,770
It was a...

5494
03:57:55,770 --> 03:57:57,390
I thought it was a good ending.

5495
03:57:57,550 --> 03:57:58,390
But I know a lot of people...

5496
03:57:58,390 --> 03:58:00,110
Some people didn't think it was a good ending.

5497
03:58:00,110 --> 03:58:01,070
But, like...

5498
03:58:01,070 --> 03:58:02,990
I thought it was a great ending.

5499
03:58:05,930 --> 03:58:07,330
Janus, thank you for the super chat.

5500
03:58:07,450 --> 03:58:07,690
Thank you.

5501
03:58:07,830 --> 03:58:08,390
Thank you.

5502
03:58:10,630 --> 03:58:11,070
Uh...

5503
03:58:11,070 --> 03:58:12,570
Just for clarity...

5504
03:58:12,570 --> 03:58:13,550
The order is...

5505
03:58:13,550 --> 03:58:15,350
1, 2, 3, ODST, and reach.

5506
03:58:15,510 --> 03:58:16,130
Then you can stop.

5507
03:58:16,230 --> 03:58:17,190
The later games aren't terrible.

5508
03:58:17,390 --> 03:58:18,130
But they're not great.

5509
03:58:18,430 --> 03:58:19,370
Then people were like...

5510
03:58:19,370 --> 03:58:19,850
Fuck...

5511
03:58:19,850 --> 03:58:20,670
Bungie.

5512
03:58:20,790 --> 03:58:21,830
Or 343 Studios.

5513
03:58:22,110 --> 03:58:23,590
After 4 came out.

5514
03:58:24,810 --> 03:58:25,250
Mmm.

5515
03:58:35,450 --> 03:58:35,890
Yeah.

5516
03:58:36,270 --> 03:58:36,650
Yeah.

5517
03:58:39,870 --> 03:58:41,490
Was Cortana, like...

5518
03:58:41,490 --> 03:58:42,610
The only improvement?

5519
03:58:43,870 --> 03:58:45,690
She was the only improvement...

5520
03:58:45,690 --> 03:58:46,730
Out of everything.

5521
03:58:47,210 --> 03:58:48,190
It was just her.

5522
03:58:50,050 --> 03:58:51,610
Just because they made her, like...

5523
03:58:51,610 --> 03:58:52,570
A little sexier.

5524
03:58:56,550 --> 03:58:57,430
Oh, Lord.

5525
03:58:57,570 --> 03:58:58,490
Thank you for the super chat.

5526
03:58:58,610 --> 03:58:58,810
Thank you.

5527
03:58:58,990 --> 03:58:59,470
Thank you.

5528
03:59:02,810 --> 03:59:03,270
Um...

5529
03:59:03,270 --> 03:59:03,810
Fun fact.

5530
03:59:03,910 --> 03:59:05,290
Halo was nearly an RTS.

5531
03:59:05,630 --> 03:59:07,330
But the developers liked driving the Warthogs.

5532
03:59:07,330 --> 03:59:08,050
Too much.

5533
03:59:08,210 --> 03:59:08,890
Thank you for the super chat.

5534
03:59:09,010 --> 03:59:09,210
Thank you.

5535
03:59:09,350 --> 03:59:09,810
Thank you.

5536
03:59:15,190 --> 03:59:15,550
Hmm...

5537
03:59:15,550 --> 03:59:16,630
Gabby, thank you for the super chat.

5538
03:59:16,710 --> 03:59:16,930
Thank you.

5539
03:59:17,010 --> 03:59:17,430
Thank you.

5540
03:59:18,750 --> 03:59:19,110
So...

5541
03:59:19,110 --> 03:59:21,750
We see you're a fan of sexy alien ladies.

5542
03:59:22,030 --> 03:59:22,350
Like...

5543
03:59:22,910 --> 03:59:23,810
Like here again.

5544
03:59:26,370 --> 03:59:27,970
Bro, when they say turn her back...

5545
03:59:27,970 --> 03:59:28,490
I was like...

5546
03:59:28,490 --> 03:59:28,870
Boom!

5547
03:59:28,870 --> 03:59:29,070
Boom!

5548
03:59:30,350 --> 03:59:31,770
When they made her...

5549
03:59:31,770 --> 03:59:33,910
When they made her human again...

5550
03:59:33,910 --> 03:59:34,670
I was like...

5551
03:59:34,670 --> 03:59:34,850
Boom!

5552
03:59:38,990 --> 03:59:40,530
Thank you for the super chat.

5553
03:59:40,690 --> 03:59:42,090
And then she's like...

5554
03:59:42,090 --> 03:59:43,670
No, I gotta be a searing...

5555
03:59:43,670 --> 03:59:45,510
I gotta be one with the searing.

5556
03:59:45,510 --> 03:59:46,030
I was like...

5557
03:59:46,030 --> 03:59:46,250
Yeah!

5558
03:59:49,290 --> 03:59:50,690
And I was like...

5559
03:59:50,690 --> 03:59:52,310
You vanilla fuck!

5560
04:00:00,930 --> 04:00:03,530
Not freaky enough for Karen...

5561
04:00:03,530 --> 04:00:05,350
Because she deserves someone better...

5562
04:00:05,350 --> 04:00:06,970
That can handle her freak.

5563
04:00:07,290 --> 04:00:08,630
You vanilla fuck!

5564
04:00:09,370 --> 04:00:09,810
Like...

5565
04:00:12,450 --> 04:00:13,870
If not...

5566
04:00:13,870 --> 04:00:14,010
If not...

5567
04:00:14,010 --> 04:00:14,390
If not...

5568
04:00:14,390 --> 04:00:15,810
Not hot...

5569
04:00:19,150 --> 04:00:19,870
Um...

5570
04:00:19,870 --> 04:00:20,730
Um...

5571
04:00:20,730 --> 04:00:21,110
I...

5572
04:00:21,110 --> 04:00:22,970
Yeah, I was like...

5573
04:00:22,970 --> 04:00:25,070
Don't shit on my guy Jim...

5574
04:00:25,070 --> 04:00:26,090
Just cause he's vanilla.

5575
04:00:26,550 --> 04:00:28,790
Jim, you vanilla shithead!

5576
04:00:29,790 --> 04:00:31,210
Embrace the freak!

5577
04:00:35,170 --> 04:00:36,330
Bro, okay.

5578
04:00:36,690 --> 04:00:36,990
Okay.

5579
04:00:36,990 --> 04:00:39,590
Do you guys remember when they...

5580
04:00:39,590 --> 04:00:40,090
When Blizz...

5581
04:00:40,090 --> 04:00:41,010
Back when Blizzard tried...

5582
04:00:41,610 --> 04:00:42,130
When like...

5583
04:00:43,330 --> 04:00:44,050
Um...

5584
04:00:44,050 --> 04:00:45,290
Was it for BlizzCon?

5585
04:00:45,650 --> 04:00:48,150
They released like a video of some...

5586
04:00:48,150 --> 04:00:48,790
Of like...

5587
04:00:48,790 --> 04:00:49,030
Um...

5588
04:00:49,030 --> 04:00:50,950
They like commissioned a...

5589
04:00:50,950 --> 04:00:51,870
Studio...

5590
04:00:51,870 --> 04:00:53,950
To make a life-size figure...

5591
04:00:53,950 --> 04:00:55,210
Of Kerrigan...

5592
04:00:55,210 --> 04:00:57,590
And that shit was fucking hot.

5593
04:00:59,370 --> 04:01:00,710
I like...

5594
04:01:00,710 --> 04:01:01,770
I was like...

5595
04:01:01,770 --> 04:01:02,790
Holy fuck!

5596
04:01:03,370 --> 04:01:04,910
That's what she could look like?

5597
04:01:04,930 --> 04:01:05,510
IRL?

5598
04:01:05,510 --> 04:01:07,130
Oh my god!

5599
04:01:07,510 --> 04:01:07,830
Damn!

5600
04:01:09,510 --> 04:01:10,430
And then...

5601
04:01:10,430 --> 04:01:13,150
And then Jim turns her back into a human!

5602
04:01:13,390 --> 04:01:13,850
I was like...

5603
04:01:13,850 --> 04:01:14,290
You freak!

5604
04:01:14,630 --> 04:01:14,890
You...

5605
04:01:14,890 --> 04:01:15,690
No, I freak you...

5606
04:01:15,690 --> 04:01:16,910
I was like...

5607
04:01:16,910 --> 04:01:18,510
Jim, how fucking dare you?

5608
04:01:20,290 --> 04:01:21,850
And it wasn't the same.

5609
04:01:22,030 --> 04:01:23,710
You know, in Kerrigan...

5610
04:01:24,810 --> 04:01:25,410
Um...

5611
04:01:25,410 --> 04:01:26,830
It just...

5612
04:01:26,830 --> 04:01:27,810
It just...

5613
04:01:27,810 --> 04:01:29,430
It just wasn't the same.

5614
04:01:29,670 --> 04:01:30,050
You know?

5615
04:01:31,530 --> 04:01:32,130
Okay.

5616
04:01:32,730 --> 04:01:33,330
Uh...

5617
04:01:33,330 --> 04:01:34,010
Let me...

5618
04:01:34,010 --> 04:01:34,730
Let me show you guys.

5619
04:01:35,110 --> 04:01:35,710
Video...

5620
04:01:35,710 --> 04:01:36,470
Statue.

5621
04:01:36,750 --> 04:01:37,310
Okay.

5622
04:01:37,650 --> 04:01:38,490
Let me see.

5623
04:01:40,170 --> 04:01:40,770
Uh...

5624
04:01:40,770 --> 04:01:41,650
Is this one?

5625
04:01:41,930 --> 04:01:42,490
Side...

5626
04:01:42,490 --> 04:01:43,310
Oh my god.

5627
04:01:43,410 --> 04:01:46,170
Where was the life-size statue of Kerrigan?

5628
04:01:48,270 --> 04:01:49,750
Oh, it was so long ago.

5629
04:01:50,110 --> 04:01:51,890
It was for BlizzCon, I'm pretty sure.

5630
04:01:52,230 --> 04:01:53,010
I saw it...

5631
04:01:53,010 --> 04:01:53,790
I saw it in real life.

5632
04:01:53,910 --> 04:01:55,570
I saw that statue in real life, by the way.

5633
04:01:55,710 --> 04:01:57,990
Because I went to BlizzCon when they showcased it.

5634
04:01:59,230 --> 04:01:59,630
Um...

5635
04:02:00,210 --> 04:02:00,610
Kerrigan...

5636
04:02:01,070 --> 04:02:01,470
Life...

5637
04:02:01,470 --> 04:02:01,930
Uh...

5638
04:02:01,930 --> 04:02:02,530
Statue.

5639
04:02:02,870 --> 04:02:03,910
Life-size statue.

5640
04:02:04,090 --> 04:02:05,530
Life-size...

5641
04:02:05,530 --> 04:02:06,250
Statue.

5642
04:02:07,050 --> 04:02:07,530
Um...

5643
04:02:07,530 --> 04:02:08,770
It was a long time ago.

5644
04:02:09,030 --> 04:02:10,190
It was like...

5645
04:02:10,890 --> 04:02:12,750
A long, long time ago.

5646
04:02:13,950 --> 04:02:14,430
Um...

5647
04:02:14,430 --> 04:02:16,190
Do they still have the...

5648
04:02:16,190 --> 04:02:17,550
Oh my gosh.

5649
04:02:17,650 --> 04:02:19,170
Do they have the video of it?

5650
04:02:19,490 --> 04:02:21,550
I'm trying to see if they have the video.

5651
04:02:21,690 --> 04:02:22,810
Because it was at HQ.

5652
04:02:23,070 --> 04:02:23,450
It was at...

5653
04:02:23,450 --> 04:02:24,690
They put it in the Blizzard HQ.

5654
04:02:26,090 --> 04:02:26,570
Um...

5655
04:02:26,570 --> 04:02:27,330
Is this one?

5656
04:02:29,050 --> 04:02:30,510
I'm trying to find it, guys.

5657
04:02:30,510 --> 04:02:32,010
It was so long ago.

5658
04:02:32,190 --> 04:02:32,810
Holy shit.

5659
04:02:33,570 --> 04:02:34,050
Open.

5660
04:02:34,330 --> 04:02:35,030
Oh my god.

5661
04:02:35,030 --> 04:02:35,910
Where is it?

5662
04:02:37,790 --> 04:02:38,430
Um...

5663
04:02:38,430 --> 04:02:39,530
Here's the money shot.

5664
04:02:41,110 --> 04:02:42,290
Holy shit.

5665
04:02:44,390 --> 04:02:48,040
Holy shit.

5666
04:02:49,240 --> 04:02:49,880
Okay.

5667
04:02:50,240 --> 04:02:50,720
Okay.

5668
04:02:51,260 --> 04:02:52,220
Okay, guys.

5669
04:02:52,480 --> 04:02:53,320
Go to the...

5670
04:02:53,320 --> 04:02:54,220
Go to this.

5671
04:02:54,540 --> 04:02:55,500
Scroll down.

5672
04:02:55,920 --> 04:02:57,440
Scroll down to the first comment.

5673
04:02:57,840 --> 04:03:01,680
And then click on the link that said, Here's the money shot.

5674
04:03:01,960 --> 04:03:03,160
I can't show this on stream.

5675
04:03:03,300 --> 04:03:03,700
Just...

5676
04:03:07,260 --> 04:03:08,420
Go to this.

5677
04:03:08,420 --> 04:03:12,980
And then click on the one where it says, Here's the money shot.

5678
04:03:13,180 --> 04:03:14,240
And then you'll understand.

5679
04:03:14,840 --> 04:03:15,540
And then...

5680
04:03:19,980 --> 04:03:21,640
What a shot.

5681
04:03:21,920 --> 04:03:22,580
I know.

5682
04:03:23,360 --> 04:03:24,640
I was like, Wow.

5683
04:03:25,960 --> 04:03:26,600
Wow.

5684
04:03:32,280 --> 04:03:33,080
Oh, man.

5685
04:03:33,420 --> 04:03:34,780
I wish, like...

5686
04:03:35,400 --> 04:03:35,840
Um...

5687
04:03:40,060 --> 04:03:41,780
God, they don't...

5688
04:03:41,780 --> 04:03:43,120
I think, like...

5689
04:03:43,120 --> 04:03:44,520
They don't have the video anymore.

5690
04:03:44,520 --> 04:03:45,200
That sucks.

5691
04:03:45,760 --> 04:03:46,540
I'm sad.

5692
04:03:46,800 --> 04:03:48,600
I can't find, like, an actual good...

5693
04:03:48,600 --> 04:03:49,800
Because it was so long ago.

5694
04:03:49,880 --> 04:03:51,000
I think it's because, like...

5695
04:03:51,000 --> 04:03:52,860
It was so long ago...

5696
04:03:52,860 --> 04:03:54,120
That they don't have...

5697
04:03:54,120 --> 04:03:55,960
The videos of it is gone.

5698
04:03:56,440 --> 04:03:57,220
I'm so sad.

5699
04:03:57,380 --> 04:03:59,300
Because I've ever seen a video in the, like...

5700
04:03:59,300 --> 04:03:59,980
H...

5701
04:03:59,980 --> 04:04:00,760
Like, all...

5702
04:04:00,760 --> 04:04:03,460
Most of the stuff that they have right now...

5703
04:04:03,460 --> 04:04:04,280
That's on the...

5704
04:04:04,280 --> 04:04:06,000
It might be on an archive site or something.

5705
04:04:06,380 --> 04:04:08,400
But the only stuff I can find right now...

5706
04:04:08,400 --> 04:04:09,000
Are the...

5707
04:04:10,360 --> 04:04:10,880
Um...

5708
04:04:10,880 --> 04:04:12,660
Are the ones from, like...

5709
04:04:12,660 --> 04:04:14,500
Like, old pictures of it at...

5710
04:04:14,500 --> 04:04:15,380
At BlizzCon.

5711
04:04:16,880 --> 04:04:18,800
He must have took it down or something.

5712
04:04:20,600 --> 04:04:22,480
Because I remember seeing the video.

5713
04:04:22,640 --> 04:04:24,120
And that video was, like...

5714
04:04:24,120 --> 04:04:25,000
Fucking crazy.

5715
04:04:25,640 --> 04:04:27,260
Like, of them, like, making it, too.

5716
04:04:29,600 --> 04:04:30,120
Um...

5717
04:04:30,120 --> 04:04:30,640
But it was...

5718
04:04:30,640 --> 04:04:32,200
I remember when I first saw...

5719
04:04:32,200 --> 04:04:33,740
That statue at BlizzCon, I was like...

5720
04:04:33,740 --> 04:04:34,540
Jesus Christ.

5721
04:04:34,800 --> 04:04:35,660
Holy shit.

5722
04:04:36,220 --> 04:04:37,600
That shit was crazy.

5723
04:04:37,960 --> 04:04:38,300
Yeah.

5724
04:04:39,500 --> 04:04:39,880
Uh...

5725
04:04:39,880 --> 04:04:40,340
There's one...

5726
04:04:40,340 --> 04:04:41,720
Yeah, but that's not the same.

5727
04:04:42,100 --> 04:04:43,140
It was a lot...

5728
04:04:43,620 --> 04:04:44,000
Um...

5729
04:04:44,000 --> 04:04:44,440
It was, like...

5730
04:04:44,440 --> 04:04:45,800
There was a lot more to it.

5731
04:04:46,900 --> 04:04:47,640
It's not...

5732
04:04:47,640 --> 04:04:48,120
Like...

5733
04:04:48,120 --> 04:04:50,040
It's, like, very blurry and everything.

5734
04:04:50,180 --> 04:04:51,240
I knew there was one.

5735
04:04:51,740 --> 04:04:54,220
I knew there was one where it was, like, HD quality.

5736
04:04:59,000 --> 04:04:59,380
Um...

5737
04:04:59,880 --> 04:05:00,460
Let's see.

5738
04:05:00,680 --> 04:05:02,020
Mike, thank you to the super chat.

5739
04:05:02,100 --> 04:05:02,780
Thank you, thank you.

5740
04:05:03,020 --> 04:05:03,680
Fun fact.

5741
04:05:03,840 --> 04:05:05,580
Taylor2 has a cut enemy.

5742
04:05:05,920 --> 04:05:06,960
Like, Juggernaut.

5743
04:05:07,040 --> 04:05:07,700
Thank you to the super chat.

5744
04:05:07,700 --> 04:05:08,480
Thank you, thank you.

5745
04:05:08,620 --> 04:05:09,560
A lot of you think it was super chat.

5746
04:05:09,700 --> 04:05:10,300
Thank you, thank you.

5747
04:05:10,820 --> 04:05:11,140
Olysses.

5748
04:05:11,340 --> 04:05:12,380
Thank you for the super chat.

5749
04:05:12,460 --> 04:05:13,160
Thank you, thank you.

5750
04:05:13,520 --> 04:05:16,940
The little games after Bungie aren't bad, but definitely not as good story-wise.

5751
04:05:17,320 --> 04:05:18,440
And that's great gameplay, though.

5752
04:05:18,560 --> 04:05:19,220
But not much story.

5753
04:05:19,280 --> 04:05:22,100
Yeah, I know Infinite is really good in terms of, like, multiplayer.

5754
04:05:22,100 --> 04:05:29,520
Everyone, people have, and then, like, people quit their pro career and other games to try to pursue infinite pro career.

5755
04:05:29,820 --> 04:05:33,680
And then, like, and then Bungie fucked up somehow.

5756
04:05:33,680 --> 04:05:34,780
I don't know how.

5757
04:05:35,160 --> 04:05:37,960
But, like, I guess, like, balancing-wise, they fucked up balancing.

5758
04:05:39,060 --> 04:05:39,620
Hmm.

5759
04:05:40,720 --> 04:05:40,920
Hmm.

5760
04:05:40,920 --> 04:05:41,300
Or something.

5761
04:05:44,920 --> 04:05:46,040
And, um...

5762
04:05:46,040 --> 04:05:48,200
The pro...

5763
04:05:48,200 --> 04:05:49,660
Like, the...

5764
04:05:49,660 --> 04:05:52,840
I guess, like, the pro sector has, like, died out.

5765
04:05:53,300 --> 04:05:54,840
So, now they just didn't do anything.

5766
04:05:55,940 --> 04:05:57,520
Jakarta, thank you for the super chat.

5767
04:05:57,660 --> 04:05:58,340
Thank you.

5768
04:05:58,520 --> 04:05:59,880
You're doing the Halo Deep Dive.

5769
04:06:00,020 --> 04:06:04,640
May also suggest the Halo Legends Watch-along, the Halo anime anthology movie after Halo 3.

5770
04:06:04,820 --> 04:06:06,940
There's an episode made by Toei Animation.

5771
04:06:07,280 --> 04:06:09,260
Whoa, maybe you can watch live action, too.

5772
04:06:11,060 --> 04:06:12,980
And see John Halo's ass.

5773
04:06:13,260 --> 04:06:14,320
Thank you for the super chat.

5774
04:06:14,500 --> 04:06:14,980
Thank you.

5775
04:06:15,020 --> 04:06:15,880
I'll think about it, though.

5776
04:06:16,360 --> 04:06:18,040
I'll think about the watch-along.

5777
04:06:21,160 --> 04:06:22,200
No!

5778
04:06:26,140 --> 04:06:27,900
Don't joke you.

5779
04:06:29,460 --> 04:06:31,020
Fuck you.

5780
04:06:32,460 --> 04:06:34,140
Don't you bear.

5781
04:06:35,920 --> 04:06:36,960
Why?

5782
04:06:37,500 --> 04:06:38,640
Why not, guys?

5783
04:06:41,840 --> 04:06:45,100
There is no Halo TV show.

5784
04:06:49,680 --> 04:06:52,300
Guys, what's wrong with the Halo live action?

5785
04:06:53,000 --> 04:06:57,920
Rhyming that Karrigam's invested for a mutator to have bio high heels.

5786
04:06:58,060 --> 04:06:58,860
Don't believe me.

5787
04:06:59,180 --> 04:06:59,780
Look how fun.

5788
04:06:59,900 --> 04:07:00,740
Thank you for the super chat.

5789
04:07:00,860 --> 04:07:01,060
Thank you.

5790
04:07:01,200 --> 04:07:01,680
Thank you.

5791
04:07:07,040 --> 04:07:07,920
Um... Imposter.

5792
04:07:08,240 --> 04:07:09,300
Thank you for the super chat.

5793
04:07:09,460 --> 04:07:09,660
Thank you.

5794
04:07:09,860 --> 04:07:10,280
Thank you.

5795
04:07:12,360 --> 04:07:15,260
Great, of course, Halo made it compatible with crowd control.

5796
04:07:15,740 --> 04:07:17,080
Just leaving it out with that information.

5797
04:07:17,080 --> 04:07:19,500
Bro, if I put crowd control on it, I'll never beat the game.

5798
04:07:23,740 --> 04:07:24,680
I'll prove it to you.

5799
04:07:25,460 --> 04:07:30,360
I'll do crowd control Minecraft, and then show you guys how I'll never reach...

5800
04:07:30,360 --> 04:07:32,400
I'll never even get to, like, the nether.

5801
04:07:36,280 --> 04:07:37,320
Okay, guys.

5802
04:07:38,100 --> 04:07:41,520
If I can beat mine... not beat Minecraft...

5803
04:07:42,320 --> 04:07:44,400
I'm not gonna beat Minecraft, but like...

5804
04:07:45,240 --> 04:07:47,560
If I can, like, get to the...

5805
04:07:47,960 --> 04:07:49,080
If I can... Okay, you know what?

5806
04:07:49,120 --> 04:07:50,300
If I can get to the...

5807
04:07:50,300 --> 04:07:51,340
Ender Dragon...

5808
04:07:51,340 --> 04:07:53,260
In crowd... With crowd control on...

5809
04:07:53,260 --> 04:07:54,400
In Minecraft...

5810
04:07:55,920 --> 04:07:56,440
Um...

5811
04:07:58,280 --> 04:08:01,020
Then, I'll do crowd control for a...

5812
04:08:01,020 --> 04:08:01,700
First Halo.

5813
04:08:01,700 --> 04:08:01,740
Flo.

5814
04:08:05,320 --> 04:08:06,180
I'll do it.

5815
04:08:06,520 --> 04:08:07,820
I need to test the waters...

5816
04:08:07,820 --> 04:08:09,160
before I go straight in.

5817
04:08:09,740 --> 04:08:09,920
I...

5818
04:08:16,520 --> 04:08:22,460
I need to test the waters before I fucking let you guys get Halo first.

5819
04:08:22,640 --> 04:08:24,280
First mod with crowd control.

5820
04:08:26,020 --> 04:08:26,780
No.

5821
04:08:28,080 --> 04:08:28,720
No.

5822
04:08:30,560 --> 04:08:32,900
I'm never being my... exactly.

5823
04:08:36,920 --> 04:08:38,080
Exactly, guys.

5824
04:08:43,850 --> 04:08:46,550
Okay, this fried rice is so fucking good.

5825
04:08:47,570 --> 04:08:48,430
Holy shit.

5826
04:08:51,210 --> 04:08:53,730
So about that Minecraft hardcore part too.

5827
04:08:54,610 --> 04:08:56,330
All right, thank you for the super chat.

5828
04:08:56,470 --> 04:08:56,670
Thank you.

5829
04:08:56,770 --> 04:08:57,190
Thank you.

5830
04:09:01,850 --> 04:09:05,710
I don't think Min is mentally prepared for that for a long time.

5831
04:09:10,710 --> 04:09:13,590
I don't... I don't think she's like...

5832
04:09:13,590 --> 04:09:15,330
I don't think she's ready.

5833
04:09:19,950 --> 04:09:20,390
Mmm.

5834
04:09:20,970 --> 04:09:21,410
Oh, my God.

5835
04:09:24,710 --> 04:09:25,770
I'm gonna call it here.

5836
04:09:27,450 --> 04:09:28,630
So I can finish my meal.

5837
04:09:28,830 --> 04:09:30,730
And also, Thad actually needs his walkies now.

5838
04:09:31,030 --> 04:09:32,690
I'm a little late on his walkies.

5839
04:09:33,070 --> 04:09:35,810
And then, um, so I gotta give him his walkies now.

5840
04:09:36,150 --> 04:09:37,990
But thank you all for coming, everybody.

5841
04:09:37,990 --> 04:09:41,470
I hope you guys had a great time hanging out with me today.

5842
04:09:42,350 --> 04:09:44,350
Um, you guys didn't know before I go.

5843
04:09:44,550 --> 04:09:45,250
Buy my merch!

5844
04:09:45,770 --> 04:09:47,690
My birthday merch is out now!

5845
04:09:48,230 --> 04:09:55,610
So, if you guys want to support me, um, and also get something cool along the way, um, I have my merch out.

5846
04:09:55,850 --> 04:09:57,410
Let me see if I can grab the graphics real quick.

5847
04:09:57,410 --> 04:09:57,750
Whoa!

5848
04:10:00,550 --> 04:10:01,450
Where is it?

5849
04:10:01,610 --> 04:10:03,290
I always forget where I put the merch graphics.

5850
04:10:03,450 --> 04:10:05,150
I forgot to talk about this, too.

5851
04:10:05,710 --> 04:10:06,510
Uh, but yes!

5852
04:10:06,690 --> 04:10:10,010
It's, it's pinned on my chat right now.

5853
04:10:10,210 --> 04:10:10,410
Whoa!

5854
04:10:10,410 --> 04:10:11,650
Doki merch!

5855
04:10:11,810 --> 04:10:13,550
It's on DokiMerch.com!

5856
04:10:14,050 --> 04:10:15,390
There's a lot of merch over here!

5857
04:10:15,610 --> 04:10:16,470
That's a lot of merch!

5858
04:10:16,930 --> 04:10:18,950
But yes, check out that merch, guys!

5859
04:10:19,250 --> 04:10:19,530
Whoa!

5860
04:10:20,790 --> 04:10:22,630
Um, it really does help a lot.

5861
04:10:22,990 --> 04:10:24,430
And you can get something in return.

5862
04:10:24,670 --> 04:10:27,970
And I can do more funky merch, too, in the future.

5863
04:10:28,270 --> 04:10:30,690
I can produce more merch in the future.

5864
04:10:31,250 --> 04:10:32,150
Um, but yes!

5865
04:10:32,510 --> 04:10:32,990
Hey, guys!

5866
04:10:34,170 --> 04:10:40,770
Um, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5867
04:10:40,950 --> 04:10:41,390
Have you?

5868
04:10:41,870 --> 04:10:42,350
Stay up for me.

5869
04:10:42,750 --> 04:10:43,130
Head to bed.

5870
04:10:43,130 --> 04:10:44,270
He knows he needs to walk, please.

5871
04:10:44,650 --> 04:10:45,670
Uh, just stay up for me.

5872
04:10:45,790 --> 04:10:47,710
Head to bed, cause you deserve it!

5873
04:10:47,850 --> 04:10:48,030
Why?

5874
04:10:48,750 --> 04:10:49,110
No.

5875
04:10:49,850 --> 04:10:50,210
Why?

5876
04:10:50,870 --> 04:10:51,590
Oh my gosh.

5877
04:10:52,570 --> 04:10:52,810
Alright.

5878
04:10:53,210 --> 04:10:53,510
Hey, guys.

5879
04:10:53,590 --> 04:10:54,430
I'll see you guys later, everyone!

5880
04:10:54,710 --> 04:10:55,290
Bye, guys!

5881
04:10:55,750 --> 04:10:56,110
Bye!
