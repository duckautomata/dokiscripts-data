1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,840
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,120
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,280
I'm currently eating my lunch dinner, right?

4
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,020
Or lunch.

5
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,360
Sorry, you're gonna hear dad barking because he's trying to be like, I WANT LUNCH DINNER!

6
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,560
Even though he just, he literally, I literally just fed him like 20 minutes ago.

7
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,800
But, um...

8
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,760
I'm having my 5pm lunch right now, and then after the stream, I'll grab actual food.

9
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,720
But, basically, I finally found a bakery.

10
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,020
A Japanese bakery that sells, like, Japanese, special, like, Japanese, like, bread.

11
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,540
I don't remember exactly what they're called, but oh my gosh, I love...

12
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,080
Since we're open, please.

13
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,180
Please.

14
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,980
No.

15
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,120
No?

16
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,180
No.

17
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,580
No.

18
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,200
I figured.

19
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,880
It's my little snack before my actual dinner dinner.

20
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,020
Um, and also, like, I'm worried that...

21
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,440
I don't, I'm worried that my bread's gonna expire.

22
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,020
Because, like, I actually ordered this, like, two days ago, and I haven't, uh...

23
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,060
I haven't even tried the bread out yet.

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,200
No.

25
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,600
No.

26
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,920
Oh, shit.

27
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,340
Okay, he's like... Yeah, I think he needs some milk for it.

28
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:01,860
No!

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,600
No.

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,840
My dog is very, um, food motivated.

31
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,020
Which is bad, because...

32
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,280
He will actually follow a criminal if he has food.

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,420
It's very bad, because if I get fucking robbed...

34
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,300
And the criminal was like, oh, you know, instead of protecting me...

35
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,500
He's gonna be like, he has food, so I guess you're gonna get shot now.

36
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,780
Or shanked if I'm... Or shanked or something.

37
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
And I'm a little bit worried about that.

38
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm just a little worried at how food motivated he is.

39
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,200
He literally would follow a stranger if she had treats, like...

40
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,660
I told you guys this before, but don't you... Don't say that!

41
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
Like, I... I don't know what to do.

42
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,180
Like...

43
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,200
I... Literally, like...

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,760
I told you guys this story before, but, like...

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,880
You bump into this random lady, but she had, like, treats on her.

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,060
So, obviously, Ducky Amber Doge, he, like, smelled those treats.

47
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,100
So he got super excited, because, like...

48
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,740
And, like, she was, like, this dog walker that I would bump into.

49
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,520
And then she was, like, joking around and be like...

50
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,360
Uh-huh, what if I just take your leash and then walk away with it?

51
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,560
Do you think he'll follow me?

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,700
And he didn't look back.

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,460
He literally wagged his tail and walked away with her.

54
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,940
Because she had food on her.

55
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,380
So, I was like, oh, that's not good.

56
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,100
That's not good at all.

57
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,180
No?

58
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,060
No?

59
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:55,980
No.

60
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,920
So, like...

61
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,920
So, like, I'm like, this is not good.

62
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,320
No?

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,040
No.

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,060
No.

65
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,390
Alright.

66
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,450
I finished my food, so, like, he's gonna stop barking now.

67
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,530
Now that he knows the food is gone.

68
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,290
There's no food.

69
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:20,850
No food.

70
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,130
He's not gonna bark anymore.

71
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,170
Alright, you little shit.

72
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,710
He's loyal to his stomach.

73
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,470
No more food, and now he can't do anything.

74
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,830
Alright.

75
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,510
Snacking is done.

76
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,130
Alright!

77
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,310
Hello, everybody!

78
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,550
Today, we're gonna be playing Doraemon!

79
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,230
Dorayaki Shop Story.

80
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,130
I've been meaning to play this game for a while.

81
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,150
Oh my god, Doki finally not playing a Flavor of the Month game?

82
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,950
Oh my god, she's actually playing games that...

83
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,130
No, other games interest me too, but like...

84
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,410
Oh my god, she's playing a game that's not, like, the most popular game on Steam at the moment?

85
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,410
That's fucking crazy, what's wrong?

86
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,490
Anyway.

87
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,330
So, I grew up with Doraemon.

88
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,110
But before he was called Doraemon, he was called Ding Dong in Cantonese, in Hong Kong.

89
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,810
So, like, I used to watch a lot of Doraemon growing up.

90
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,670
And I used to read, like, the comic books and everything too.

91
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,650
So, he was basically a part of my childhood.

92
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,770
And when I saw this on Steam, I was like...

93
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:49,770
Oh!

94
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,850
It's Doraemon!

95
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,270
Oh my god, I can't wait!

96
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,990
I was super excited.

97
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:05,470
Because I used to be super fucking obsessed with Ding Dong growing up.

98
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,430
And I had, like, all the manga of it.

99
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,630
And I even had the official English translations of the novel.

100
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,230
I used to read the baseball adaptation.

101
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,030
Actually, read is like a stretch.

102
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,250
It was in Cantonese.

103
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,650
So, like, the text was in Cantonese.

104
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,430
And I had no idea what they were saying.

105
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,270
But I really liked the art.

106
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,110
I really liked the artwork.

107
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,430
So, I would read the baseball adaptation.

108
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,770
But I had no idea what was going on.

109
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,770
And then I used to read the...

110
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,210
I just tried to guess what's going on by the pictures.

111
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,490
And, yeah, I experienced it.

112
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,730
Yeah, and then I had the manga for...

113
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,710
I actually own...

114
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,830
Because back in Hong Kong, there's this really popular...

115
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,770
There's this really popular children's comic magazine called...

116
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,530
I think it was either...

117
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,490
I think it was Happy Dragon.

118
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,070
Or it was, like, Coco.

119
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,310
It was either Happy Dragon or Coco.

120
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,950
Because I used to buy those two growing up.

121
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,750
And they would run the baseball manga.

122
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,190
They would run the baseball series.

123
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,890
So, I would buy it every week just to read.

124
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,930
And they also ran the Pokemon series, too.

125
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,450
The really hardcore Pokemon series.

126
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,830
So, oh, yeah, Koro Koro.

127
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,170
Was it called Koro Koro?

128
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,310
I don't remember.

129
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,730
It was Happy Dragon and Koro Koro.

130
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,310
And I used to read...

131
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,310
I would buy them, like, weekly.

132
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,370
Actually, my dad would help buy them for me weekly.

133
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,350
Or I would go to news...

134
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,970
Oh, my gosh, I remember in Hong Kong...

135
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,650
I don't know if they still do that anymore.

136
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,830
Because, like, people don't buy news...

137
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,870
Like, don't buy...

138
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,290
Like, don't really buy magazines outside anymore.

139
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,870
But there would be, like, magazine stalls.

140
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,750
And then I would...

141
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,690
My dad and I...

142
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,510
My dad or I would buy them.

143
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,470
And also, like, Lou Fuzi or, like, Mr. Q.

144
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,850
And he would buy, like, Lou Fuzi, Happy Dragon, and Koro Koro for me.

145
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,310
And so, like, I would read those a lot.

146
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,450
As a kid, growing up.

147
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,670
And I remember, like, really enjoying the baseball series for one of them.

148
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,270
The Doraemon baseball series.

149
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,490
And also, like, I really enjoyed...

150
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,670
There's a million adaptations.

151
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,450
There's literally, like, a million fucking adaptations of Doraemon.

152
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,430
But it's not from...

153
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,250
It's not from, like, the original artist.

154
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,670
Or the original...

155
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,530
Like, the original, like, manga cup.

156
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,490
Because there was one with, like...

157
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,490
Like, based off of, like, the adventures of Doraemon's cousins.

158
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,590
And, like, they're all, like, cousins from different parts of the world.

159
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:44,870
And...

160
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,030
It was so interesting.

161
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,010
It was such an interesting concept.

162
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,610
And then...

163
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,450
And then there was, like...

164
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:53,890
I don't remember.

165
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,490
Yeah, there was a cousin spin.

166
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,010
Yeah, the Doraemon multiverse.

167
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,370
Yeah.

168
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,430
Yeah, I know he's dead, guys.

169
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,930
I know he's dead.

170
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,190
He's been... He's, like...

171
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,190
He's been dead for a long time.

172
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,570
I know that, guys.

173
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:07,570
I...

174
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,850
Um... Yeah.

175
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,010
Was it really called...

176
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,970
Was it, like, called the Doraemons?

177
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,770
I don't even remember.

178
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,050
I didn't... I never knew what the name of the...

179
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,710
Like I said, I own the manga of it.

180
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,890
But, like, I had no idea what was exactly going on.

181
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,750
I just...

182
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,390
I just experienced it via the pictures.

183
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,750
I was like, whoa, the pictures...

184
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,390
It looks like they're having a good time.

185
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,950
Like...

186
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,070
I just be like...

187
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,570
I just experienced it with the pictures and be like, whoa.

188
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,610
This adventure looks so cool.

189
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,890
I have no idea what they're saying.

190
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,230
But the adventures look amazing.

191
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,950
It looks so pretty.

192
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,390
And I also...

193
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,890
I also own the manga of the...

194
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,210
There was another one they did.

195
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,930
Where it was basically, like, Doraemon serious side.

196
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,150
Serious stories.

197
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,670
Where they would go in on, like, actual adventures and stuff.

198
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,870
So I had, like, the whole, like, manga of it.

199
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,790
It was all in Chinese.

200
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,790
It was all in Cantonese.

201
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,150
I don't remember if it was Chinese or Cantonese.

202
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,610
I don't remember if it was, like, in traditional or simplified.

203
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,290
Because, like, I bought them in, like, very...

204
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,050
I bought them either in Shenzhen or, like, in Hong Kong.

205
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,370
So I don't remember.

206
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,090
So...

207
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,950
I also own, like, the serious ones.

208
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,410
Where they go on actual adventures.

209
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,690
And I think my favorite story from those...

210
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,850
Because, like, I actually bought, like, the DVDs as well.

211
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,830
Or was it VCDs?

212
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,510
I don't fucking remember.

213
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,730
But I also had, like, the DVDs of them.

214
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,450
And they had, like, actual, like, English subtitles.

215
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,490
So I sort of knew what they were...

216
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,890
I didn't understand what the fuck was going on in the book.

217
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,030
But I knew what was going on in the movies.

218
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,930
Because I had English subtitles to read it from.

219
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,930
And, um...

220
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,410
And I think my favorite story in the serious ones...

221
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,650
Was the dinosaur.

222
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,910
I cried.

223
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,930
If anyone remembers the dinosaur story...

224
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,370
Oh my god, I...

225
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,830
I think that has to be, like, one of, like, my favorite stories.

226
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,430
From, like, the more serious side of Doraemon.

227
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,150
Because, like, um...

228
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,150
I won't spoil it, but it gets really sad.

229
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,310
At the end, it gets...

230
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,150
It gets so...

231
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,810
It gets really sad in the end.

232
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,490
But I don't remember what the serious was called.

233
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,170
But the dinosaur one was the most memorable one for me.

234
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,050
Um, there was one with a dog.

235
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,910
I forgot, like, the dog humans?

236
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,330
Oh my god, what was it?

237
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,070
The dog movie.

238
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,530
They made so many versions of it.

239
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:49,970
What was it?

240
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,450
Oh, yeah!

241
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,030
The one where, like, Dai Hong.

242
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,950
Or is it Nobita?

243
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,870
I think it's called, like, Nobita in Japanese, right?

244
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,310
But, like, I knew his name as Dai Hong.

245
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,690
And, like, he found, like...

246
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,770
He went to, like, the multiverse.

247
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,270
Of, like, his, like...

248
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,210
The multiverse.

249
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,090
Where, like, there's him.

250
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,970
But what if he was a dog?

251
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,050
So...

252
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,350
So, it was basically, yeah, the...

253
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,490
And then they found out that...

254
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,670
It was such a...

255
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,110
It was so interesting.

256
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,090
Because they found out that it wasn't a multiverse.

257
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,330
But it was actually, like, um, the future.

258
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,890
It was actually the future.

259
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,450
Because they sent these dogs into their own planet.

260
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,430
And then those dogs became human.

261
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,030
But then, like, it was some time travel.

262
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,070
It's weird.

263
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,150
They gave the dogs technology.

264
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,610
So then they evolved into dog humans.

265
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,910
And then, so, like, because of that...

266
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,830
They somehow traveled to the future.

267
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,690
And was like, whoa.

268
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,750
Whoa, like...

269
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,470
Who are these dogs?

270
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,860
So, yeah, it was like Planet of the Apes.

271
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,560
But Planet of the Dogs, basically.

272
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,080
But they also remake these movies so much.

273
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,900
That, like, I don't even remember which version it was that I watched.

274
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,660
They remake it so fucking much.

275
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,780
Because there's not, you know...

276
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,740
They can't really make new stories out of it.

277
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,060
So, like, I don't remember which one was the one I watched.

278
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,580
It must have...

279
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,920
It's very old.

280
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,420
I remember it being, like, very, very old.

281
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,580
Most likely the older versions.

282
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,180
Because I haven't watched...

283
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,920
The only, the most recent Doraemon movie I watched...

284
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,260
Was the 3D one.

285
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,520
And I watched it on the plane and I cried so much.

286
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,520
And then I remember, I told you guys this story before.

287
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,580
I watched the 3D one.

288
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,980
Where it was, like, Doraemon and you or something.

289
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,900
I don't remember what it's called.

290
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,460
And then, I was in business class.

291
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,000
So then I was crying my fucking eyes out watching it.

292
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,960
Because the ending was really, really sad.

293
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,780
Because I legitimately thought Doraemon was gonna leave.

294
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,800
Even though, I'm like, there's no way he's gonna leave.

295
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,280
He's literally...

296
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,740
The title, like...

297
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,780
I was like, oh my god.

298
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,900
What if he actually leaves for real?

299
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,000
And then we'll never get Doraemon anymore.

300
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,320
I'm like, oh my...

301
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,220
And I started crying.

302
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,400
I was like, oh my god.

303
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,680
He's actually gonna be gone forever.

304
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,520
You guys stand by me.

305
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,480
And I started crying.

306
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,700
I was like, oh my god.

307
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,320
This is over.

308
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,580
They're killing the main character off.

309
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,260
And we'll never see him again.

310
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,980
Oh my god.

311
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,240
He's actually never gonna come back.

312
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,260
And then Nobita is gonna fail as a person.

313
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:11,060
Because if he doesn't have Doraemon, he'll grow up to be a dead bee.

314
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,520
Oh my god.

315
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,640
It's the worst future he could ever have.

316
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,460
It's over.

317
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,240
And then he comes back.

318
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,260
And I was like, yay.

319
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,920
I took it.

320
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,400
Don't say that.

321
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,840
Anyway.

322
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,540
And then the flight attendant came over.

323
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,880
And was like, are you okay?

324
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,300
And I was like, yeah, I'm okay.

325
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,640
I'm okay.

326
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,160
But yeah.

327
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,420
That's basically the last Doraemon movie I watched.

328
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,680
I haven't watched any of the newer stuff.

329
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,800
Ever since they changed the voice actor for Doraemon.

330
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,100
The Cantonese version.

331
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,540
I know it's because they had to.

332
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,680
To make it more faithful to the original voice actor.

333
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,240
To the original Japanese voice actor.

334
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,380
I was sad.

335
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,960
I was very sad.

336
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,440
Because I grew up with his voice acting.

337
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,800
I was like, no!

338
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,580
You're supposed to voice act Doraemon until I die.

339
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,160
So I don't have to live with change.

340
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,540
You're supposed to be his voice until I cease to exist.

341
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,540
So I can always keep watching Doraemon.

342
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,460
Felt the same.

343
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,380
That's why I never watched.

344
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,840
No, not the Japanese voice actor.

345
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,100
I know the Japanese voice actor.

346
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,020
I never grew up with a Japanese voice actress.

347
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,020
Sorry, voice actress.

348
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,620
Because I was never into.

349
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,080
I grew up with the Cantonese voice actor.

350
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:20,240
So that's why when I listened to the original voice acting for the first time.

351
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,760
I was like, this ain't right.

352
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
That's not the ding dong I know.

353
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,220
Oh,

354
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,080
yeah.

355
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,860
Oh, wait.

356
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,180
The Cantonese voice actor passed away too.

357
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,200
Oh, no.

358
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,740
No.

359
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,760
Why did you have to...

360
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,120
Oh, my God.

361
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,440
No.

362
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,240
No.

363
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,200
No.

364
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,240
I didn't know.

365
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,990
Ding Dong dies.

366
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:01,950
No.

367
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,910
Why didn't you know?

368
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,610
I want to live in the fantasy world where he's still there.

369
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:15,710
Anyway.

370
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,230
Like I said.

371
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,530
Ding Dong never dies.

372
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,530
It's a terrible day for Rain.

373
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,070
It's dry over.

374
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,170
This is why change is bad.

375
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:32,990
Anyway.

376
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:41,450
So I never watched the newer movies or the newer series.

377
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,550
Because like...

378
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,770
It just didn't feel the same, you know.

379
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,690
I just don't...

380
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,210
I don't know.

381
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,570
It's like, you know when you grow up with a certain...

382
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:58,930
I think it would be better if they got the newer voice actors sounded the same as the original.

383
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,090
Not the Japanese original.

384
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:01,950
My original.

385
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,430
Not the Japanese original.

386
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,530
My original.

387
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,250
Because like, you don't understand.

388
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,450
The Cantonese dubbing for Doraemon.

389
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,590
He dubbed that show for so long.

390
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,910
That's the voice I hear when I hear Doraemon talk.

391
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:33,050
So when the newer voice actor is now more faithful to the original Japanese version.

392
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,710
I was like...

393
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,610
I couldn't.

394
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,630
I couldn't adapt.

395
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,910
I was like...

396
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,750
I watched the show for so long.

397
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,490
I couldn't adapt to the new voice.

398
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,490
It was such a...

399
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,030
I was like, that's not him.

400
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,630
I know that's him in the Japanese voice acting.

401
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,290
But that's not him.

402
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,810
So I got really sad.

403
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,130
So I never kept up with it.

404
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,330
But I still love Doraemon.

405
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,270
I still love...

406
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:12,470
Actually, in Hong Kong, they did a special performance in Hong Kong.

407
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,230
Doraemon did a special show there.

408
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,770
And I remember my parents bringing me to the show.

409
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,790
I don't know what it was called.

410
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,010
I think it was like a special show.

411
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,090
I think it was like a world tour.

412
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,730
And it was an incredibly special show.

413
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,690
Because they had like...

414
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,350
It was like...

415
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,870
Oh my god.

416
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,030
I wish I could...

417
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:39,210
I wish I remember exactly what the show was.

418
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,730
Because they had like...

419
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,330
I bought merch for it and everything.

420
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,370
And...

421
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:45,930
Oh my god.

422
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,850
It was...

423
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,530
It was like...

424
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,130
I wish I remember.

425
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,210
I wish I remember exactly what it was called.

426
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,070
Because it was basically like a musical performance.

427
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,730
And...

428
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,530
I remember my parents...

429
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,070
I was so obsessed with Doraemon.

430
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:05,670
That...

431
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,550
That...

432
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,690
My parents bought like special tickets for like...

433
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,970
Front row seats for it.

434
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,430
And I bought almost all the merch.

435
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,510
I had like the umbrella.

436
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,690
The shirt.

437
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,570
The sweater.

438
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,250
And everything.

439
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,410
I bought almost all the merch from the show.

440
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,730
And it was like one of my happier memories.

441
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,430
Because it was...

442
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,030
Oh my gosh.

443
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,150
It was such a...

444
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,770
I was like...

445
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,630
There they are!

446
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,370
Oh my god!

447
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,640
I was so happy.

448
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,680
I was so fucking obsessed.

449
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,620
And then I loved like...

450
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,440
Dora...

451
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,480
And because of that...

452
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,140
I was obsessed with dorayaki.

453
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,620
But like...

454
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,020
Every time...

455
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,440
Oh my gosh.

456
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,680
What is it called in Cantonese?

457
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,320
豆沙包.

458
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,400
豆沙包.

459
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,660
我好鍾意豆沙包。

460
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,420
Like...

461
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,360
Oh sorry.

462
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,740
My brain just swapped to Cantonese.

463
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,680
But...

464
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,760
I was so obsessed with dorayaki.

465
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,580
And I was like...

466
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,800
Oh my god.

467
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,060
I would always want to eat dorayaki.

468
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,140
But I hated the taste.

469
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,500
I like...

470
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,420
I would...

471
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,500
I would like...

472
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,560
Force myself to eat dorayaki.

473
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,220
Because I loved dorayaki so much.

474
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,380
And I would be like...

475
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,020
Oh my god.

476
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,600
我鍾意豆沙包。

477
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,780
And then my mom would buy me dorayaki.

478
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,800
And then I would take like...

479
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,720
I would take like one or two bites.

480
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,780
And I was like...

481
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,100
Oh yeah.

482
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,860
I hate this.

483
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,720
But...

484
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,600
I would be like...

485
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:55,940
Oh yeah.

486
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,980
I forgot.

487
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,920
I don't really like the taste of it.

488
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,260
But I kept doing it.

489
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,920
I was like...

490
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,200
Do it for him.

491
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,220
Do it for him.

492
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,560
Yeah.

493
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,440
So...

494
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,380
So yeah.

495
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,260
Like I always...

496
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,840
I always like eat half of it.

497
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,780
Because I just hate...

498
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,000
I just don't like the taste.

499
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,840
But I just love...

500
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,300
I just love dorayaki so much.

501
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,260
That I would buy it for him.

502
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:26,820
Like...

503
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,040
Thank you for the super chat.

504
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,540
Thank you.

505
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,300
Thank you.

506
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,800
Paladin, thank you for the super chat.

507
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,140
Thank you.

508
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,740
Thank you.

509
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,500
Today is my 34th birthday.

510
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,480
What better way to celebrate than to watch a non-Marvel livestream?

511
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,280
Just kidding.

512
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,640
Keep up the great work, Doki.

513
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,940
Thank you for the super chat, Paladin.

514
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,300
Thank you.

515
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,960
Thank you.

516
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,620
Happy birthday to you.

517
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,260
Happy birthday to you.

518
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,900
Happy birthday, dear Paladin.

519
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,620
Happy birthday to you.

520
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,340
Yay!

521
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,100
Happy birthday!

522
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,800
Anyway, that is my history with Doraemon.

523
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,880
I'm super excited.

524
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,920
I have no idea what...

525
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,560
I think this is like a bakery simulator.

526
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,840
So...

527
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,660
We're gonna be...

528
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,180
It has to be more chill, right?

529
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,360
It can't be a stressful bakery simulator.

530
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,700
It literally has Doraemon in it.

531
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,700
So...

532
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,920
It can't be that bad, right?

533
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,540
I can't be like...

534
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,720
Like stressed out like the other simulating games.

535
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,260
Alright, let me get...

536
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,060
Dorayaki!

537
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,480
Oh my god!

538
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,000
There's...

539
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,640
There he is!

540
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,360
Oh, wait!

541
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,540
That's the other Dogman!

542
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,600
That's not the Dogstar Star.

543
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,340
Oh my god!

544
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,020
There's the other Dogman!

545
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,040
Oh, they're all like from the movies!

546
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,480
Oh!

547
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,820
They're all like from the Doraemon movies!

548
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,280
That's...

549
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,260
Okay, how do I...

550
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,680
Okay, we're using keyboard.

551
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,540
We'll do...

552
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,380
Start.

553
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,080
Empty.

554
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,520
Oh, there's our sister!

555
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,680
Nobita.

556
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,240
Zzzz.

557
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,880
Snore.

558
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,140
Okay, let's fix the...

559
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,160
Let's fix this part.

560
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,840
Let's put it here.

561
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,340
Snore.

562
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,140
Nobita!

563
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,060
Dai Hong!

564
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,540
Wake up!

565
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,160
Mom just showed me this leaflet!

566
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,000
Okay, if you guys want like...

567
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,980
The game is quite loud.

568
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,000
Okay, let me...

569
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,320
Let me turn it down.

570
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,320
Alright, I got it.

571
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,600
I got it.

572
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,640
Is it better now?

573
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,260
Guys, is it better?

574
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,460
Okay, backstory!

575
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,660
Okay, I'll give you guys a quick backstory.

576
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,880
A quick backstory of this entire show.

577
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,000
Of like the manga.

578
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,200
A history of like this...

579
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,080
Why they have like a codependent relationship.

580
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,180
So...

581
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:49,660
Nobita.

582
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,140
Or what I'll say, Dai Hong.

583
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,920
He is a...

584
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,340
He is a...

585
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,860
Slacker.

586
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,160
So like...

587
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
He has no...

588
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,700
No future.

589
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,660
No goals.

590
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,040
No prospects.

591
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,080
Dumb.

592
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,800
He's just like me for real.

593
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,520
No ambition.

594
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,980
Middle class.

595
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,440
But...

596
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,800
No bitches.

597
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,520
All of that.

598
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,080
So like...

599
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
So he's basically like...

600
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,000
He was going to grow up like a deadbeat.

601
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,540
But...

602
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,860
Dai Hong...

603
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,620
Is here to stop that.

604
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,240
Because...

605
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,500
His son.

606
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,920
I believe it's a son, right?

607
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,080
Or it's like great...

608
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,240
Or like his grandson.

609
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,080
His grandson...

610
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,000
Hates his life...

611
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
Because of him.

612
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,060
His grandson...

613
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,280
Hates the life that he gave him.

614
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,160
So...

615
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,840
Great grandson.

616
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,160
I don't remember which one.

617
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,060
And was like...

618
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,540
And...

619
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,340
So it's the future.

620
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,220
And then he was like...

621
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,840
Doraemon!

622
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,760
Cause like...

623
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,660
In the future, everybody has these cat robots.

624
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
So like...

625
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,000
He was like...

626
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,560
Doraemon!

627
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,120
Get the time machine!

628
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,320
And help fix my life so it's not shitty!

629
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,340
Change my great grandpa's life so I can have a better future!

630
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,860
Basically generational trauma.

631
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,660
And he thinks that it all started because of Nobita.

632
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,720
Like as...

633
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,800
And so...

634
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,900
He also married his bully's sister.

635
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:37,880
So...

636
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,560
And so he's like...

637
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,620
He's like extra whipped, basically.

638
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,700
Because like...

639
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,060
He married his bully's sister.

640
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,940
So he's like incredibly whipped.

641
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:48,990
And so...

642
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,960
So...

643
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,420
Doraemon!

644
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,760
Came back.

645
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,980
Came to the past.

646
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,420
And be like...

647
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,420
I'm here to fix your life!

648
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,800
So your great grandson can have a better future cause it all started with you!

649
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,460
So...

650
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,460
So...

651
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,480
That's the...

652
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,540
That's the background.

653
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,280
And the reason why he doesn't have ears...

654
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,700
Is...

655
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,540
Is because...

656
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,900
Is because...

657
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,640
The reason why...

658
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,660
Also yeah...

659
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,280
Also they're really fucking poor.

660
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,040
Anyway...

661
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,680
So the reason why...

662
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,720
He doesn't have ears...

663
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,540
Is because he's afraid of mice and rats.

664
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,000
Because when he fell asleep...

665
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,280
The mice ate his ears.

666
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,580
So he's supposed to be a cat robot...

667
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,120
But he has no ears because mice ate the ears.

668
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,180
Which is really fucked up.

669
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,140
And that's why he's really afraid of mice.

670
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,440
There you go.

671
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,400
That's basically the entire story of Doraemon.

672
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,200
That's like all the story you need of Doraemon.

673
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,120
Because this is literally slice of life.

674
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,140
Like...

675
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,480
It's...

676
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,360
Yeah, he's bald now because of it.

677
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,340
So...

678
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,500
This is like a slice of life story and that's all you have to know.

679
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,040
It's like...

680
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,680
This guy...

681
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,860
What were his ears made of?

682
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,420
Also Doraemon used to have a really hot girlfriend.

683
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,220
But because he became bald...

684
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,540
She laughed at him and broke up with him.

685
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,520
So that's not really part of the story.

686
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,540
I just thought it was a fun fact.

687
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,820
He's bald just like me.

688
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,480
Oh and then...

689
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,760
Nobita owed money to the mafia at one point.

690
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,980
Because he was...

691
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,200
When he became an adult, he almost became a very successful businessman.

692
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,800
And then he like...

693
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,240
And then his company went bankrupt.

694
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,420
So that's why they're extra poor.

695
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,480
And that's why his great grandson...

696
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,760
Sent Doraemon back in time to be like...

697
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,660
Fix this!

698
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,420
That's just the lore.

699
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,640
So that's why.

700
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,500
Anyway, we're opening a Dorayaki store.

701
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,380
It says here...

702
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,720
That a new Dorayaki store has opened nearby.

703
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,240
Let's check it out.

704
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,920
Kaz, hey, wait a minute.

705
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,860
Both of you are very handsome.

706
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,900
That's messed up.

707
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,420
You're handsome too, Doraemon.

708
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,740
Thank you for the super chat, Kaz.

709
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,420
Thank you, thank you.

710
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,840
He also used to be yellow.

711
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,500
But I forgot why he turned blue.

712
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,100
I forgot the lore behind that.

713
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,760
What a fucked up way to explain the lore.

714
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,720
It's okay.

715
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,860
He changed his life so it's different now.

716
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,160
Now he's rich.

717
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,060
Apparently.

718
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,900
Now he's rich.

719
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,960
Now he fixed his life.

720
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,260
Oh, he cried.

721
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,620
Oh, yeah.

722
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,640
He cried a lot because his girlfriend left him.

723
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,120
And now...

724
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,580
And he didn't have ears anymore.

725
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,420
So...

726
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,380
And he's poor.

727
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,340
So that's why he's blue now.

728
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Like, he cried...

729
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,600
He cried so much...

730
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,280
That he wasn't...

731
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,740
He turned...

732
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,920
He actually turned blue.

733
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,120
How come I didn't know about this?

734
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,040
Anyway, let's go.

735
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,000
Bro, what the fuck?

736
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,040
Are you sure this is the right place?

737
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,260
The shutter's down.

738
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,020
What?

739
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,900
Maybe they sold out already and closed for the day.

740
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,920
Hello, did you come here for dorayaki?

741
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,500
I'm sorry.

742
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,680
I injured my hand and I can't cook anymore.

743
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,420
No!

744
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,080
Not his dorayaki!

745
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,700
It's been my dream to open a dorayaki store.

746
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,940
I can't believe I would have to stop here.

747
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,620
Lore is so crazy.

748
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,340
I'm sorry to think you just made that up.

749
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,600
No, I didn't!

750
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,580
It's actually...

751
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,340
It's actually the lore!

752
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,820
I didn't make it up.

753
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,240
That's how the story goes.

754
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,240
I feel so sad for him.

755
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,060
I wish we could help somehow.

756
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,940
It's career ending history.

757
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,100
You know what?

758
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,640
You also want to have a dorayaki store in the neighborhood, right?

759
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,660
I sure want...

760
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,120
I sure want that, but what are you asking me to do?

761
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,420
I appreciate the thought, but I just have to accept my bad luck.

762
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,560
I couldn't ask you to help out.

763
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,900
The store is only in return for lots of dorayaki.

764
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,740
Lots of...

765
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,280
Lots of dorayaki?

766
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,680
You heard that, Doraemon?

767
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,980
That sounds like a good deal.

768
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,260
Oh my God, child labor laws do not exist in this game.

769
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,740
No, Nobita!

770
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,440
You're getting scammed!

771
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,460
It wasn't the dorayaki that swayed my decision.

772
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,220
I swear.

773
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,680
I just realized I'd be really happy to help run the store until your hand heals, mister.

774
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,880
It never existed, Doraemon world.

775
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,860
Let's get ready to open our doors to customers.

776
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,620
Okay, but first...

777
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,540
I got a secretary robot!

778
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,680
Yay!

779
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,060
Let me introduce you to your new assistant.

780
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,460
Oh no, I'm so thrilled to be working together with you.

781
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,220
I'll happily help you run the store.

782
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,880
Why don't we start by giving it a name?

783
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,900
Alright, Dora Nobi Sweets.

784
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,400
Alright, what should we name our store?

785
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,340
Nani's.

786
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,940
The children get paid.

787
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,040
Real.

788
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,180
Real.

789
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,580
Alright, don't worry.

790
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,640
We have to make sure we don't get arrested.

791
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,900
Guys, we have to make sure.

792
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,020
Okay, the children get paid.

793
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:17,000
Alright, we don't want the police to find out that we are breaking child labor laws right now.

794
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,400
The children get paid.

795
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,920
That's a great name for a sweets store.

796
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,360
Now, before we can open, we have to make some products to sell.

797
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,100
Select your kitchen or go to sweets from the menu to make your very first dorayaki.

798
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,260
Yay!

799
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,140
What do they sell there?

800
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,940
Alright.

801
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,720
I wanna make...

802
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,980
I wanna make...

803
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,860
I wanna make new products.

804
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,200
You'll need this too.

805
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,100
What do you have?

806
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,880
I got a Sweets Inventy Bot!

807
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,360
They will assist you in making sweets.

808
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,240
Hello, nice to meet you.

809
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,200
I'm Wagashi.

810
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,160
Go ahead and try combining ingredients to discover new treats.

811
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,960
I'll be here to help if needed.

812
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,300
Ooh, the dorayaki patties.

813
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:10,660
Okay.

814
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,500
4,000 G's.

815
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,900
Now, new sweets, you can make one.

816
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,220
How do I make it?

817
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,520
Now, select the ingredients to combine with the base.

818
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,700
Okay.

819
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,400
Yay!

820
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,200
Maid, thank you for the super chat.

821
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,080
Thank you, thank you.

822
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,980
You forgot to tell since the manga didn't have an ending.

823
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,020
Everyone said that it was all Nobita's head and door.

824
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,320
I will never...

825
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,580
Don't!

826
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,420
Don't!

827
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,480
Don't!

828
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,860
Thank you for the super chat.

829
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,880
Thank you, thank you.

830
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,980
Select looks good when you're done.

831
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,340
I mean, it looks good.

832
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,860
Yay, the dorayaki is ready!

833
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,700
What did I get?

834
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,520
What would you like to populate?

835
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,380
Where would you choose for finishing touches?

836
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,620
I feel like if we up the taste...

837
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,620
Then, like, the popularity would go up regardless, right?

838
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,820
I feel like that.

839
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,480
I'm gonna make the taste better.

840
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,880
Alright, dorayaki.

841
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,400
Put your dora juice all over it.

842
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,100
You got...

843
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,980
Oh, there we go.

844
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,600
Coming up with an attractive presentation, the product may enhance the quality even further.

845
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,560
The product presentation can be changed later.

846
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,900
Give it a go sometimes.

847
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,820
I don't know what he put on my dorayaki.

848
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,060
What did he do to it?

849
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,140
I don't even know what he did to it.

850
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,820
Let's have our local residents try our products and tell us what they think.

851
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,700
What do you guys think?

852
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,040
I might actually like it.

853
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,520
There's a niche for it.

854
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,140
It has its charm.

855
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,760
Won't put you out of pocket.

856
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,360
Oh my god!

857
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,820
Ruthless businesswoman going up...

858
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,540
In the world.

859
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,240
For a first attempt, that was amazing!

860
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,740
Now that we have seats to sell, we can open to customers!

861
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,780
The children get...

862
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,000
Don't look at the gun, children.

863
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,800
The children get paid.

864
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,420
It's now open!

865
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,460
It's April!

866
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,860
Oh, a dorayaki store?

867
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,920
Alluring sweet smells are wafting from the inside.

868
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,940
I think I'll take a look.

869
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:31,800
Alright.

870
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,860
It's April!

871
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,760
Oh, it's so cute!

872
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,980
What would you like?

873
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,320
We only sell one thing.

874
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:37,940
Dorayaki.

875
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,860
This is a huge store for like one thing I sell.

876
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,840
What is he doing?

877
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,920
What are you doing, Nobita?

878
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,600
Oh, I get to build!

879
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,060
What do I get to build?

880
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,380
Facilities.

881
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,980
Okay, what can I build?

882
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,160
Wait, what am I...

883
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,900
Oh, wait.

884
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,420
Do I like...

885
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,040
No, I don't want...

886
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,560
Back.

887
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,280
Oh my god, I'm a little confused.

888
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:01,700
Build.

889
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,560
Oh, that...

890
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,120
Oh, wait.

891
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,120
That moves.

892
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,500
Can I have seats?

893
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,880
Do I already have seating?

894
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,240
I already have seating, so I don't need to build that.

895
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,180
Removal.

896
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,460
What am I supposed to remove?

897
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,480
I don't want to remove anything.

898
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,140
I think everything looks good so far.

899
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,860
Add two customers.

900
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,000
Okay, manage.

901
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,560
Memories.

902
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Not yet completed.

903
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,960
I don't have any memories yet.

904
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,060
Sweets.

905
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,480
Make.

906
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,800
I can't make anything yet.

907
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,040
I basically can't do anything until the...

908
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,840
Oh, I can train!

909
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,060
To improve staff abilities.

910
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,960
Staff abilities come in handy in a lot of situations.

911
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,340
So, it's well worth improving them.

912
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,160
What the fuck is he gonna do with yo-yo?

913
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,520
What is Doraemon...

914
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,980
Look at these sick yo-yo tricks, guys.

915
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,560
What am I gonna do with yo-yo?

916
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,400
Oh!

917
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,900
That's what it is.

918
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,740
Down and...

919
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,500
Right, left to see and choose where to build.

920
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,260
Wait, I wanna put a fishbowl!

921
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,900
I don't know what it does, but...

922
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,720
Um, look at my fishies!

923
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,360
Yo, look at these.

924
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,340
Yo, it's gonna attract the customers.

925
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,580
The Children's Good Paid has finally opened its doors.

926
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,960
The first customer in visit said...

927
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,820
Oh, he said that.

928
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,940
It seems that quite a few local residents are already frequenting the store.

929
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,060
Which might very well become an established feature of the neighborhood.

930
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,960
But will it attract customers from further afield?

931
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,800
We'll be straight to report on...

932
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,960
This has to be a really slow news day.

933
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,820
Like...

934
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,600
Like...

935
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,960
Oh my god, guys!

936
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,220
Front news page!

937
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,660
We have a new dorayaki store!

938
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,400
If only there was a handy tool that could tell us what our customers want to eat.

939
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,340
There is!

940
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,100
Right here!

941
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,800
What do you have in your pocket?

942
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,480
Daimon!

943
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,400
A mod reading?!

944
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,040
I should not be using this for dorayaki.

945
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,080
I'm like...

946
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,940
Oh my god!

947
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,140
I can read the minds of any citizens.

948
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,520
Of any villager here.

949
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,320
What would I do with this power?

950
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,500
Use it and you'll be able to see...

951
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,280
Exactly what sweets the person is craving.

952
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,400
And go ahead and try it on passerby.

953
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,920
What do you guys want?

954
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,340
I can see what they're thinking.

955
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,480
Wait a minute.

956
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,160
Whoa.

957
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,500
Why is one of them...

958
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,420
I can see...

959
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,560
Is that person with a sweet bubble?

960
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,560
I'll take a closer look.

961
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,300
Oh, by the way...

962
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,400
Is this legal?

963
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,820
That's true.

964
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,800
See if you can find a good use for it.

965
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,480
You got brown sugar.

966
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,680
Chestnuts.

967
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,180
White bean paste.

968
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,260
Alright, what do you see?

969
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,940
He wants brown sugar dorayaki.

970
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,360
He also wants chestnut dorayaki.

971
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,720
What else does he want?

972
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,060
It's very convenient to know what the customer wants to eat.

973
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,360
Try combining different ingredients to create the new sweets.

974
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,360
Okay.

975
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,600
I can do that.

976
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,900
Alright, Daimon.

977
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,440
We've only just opened, but we're getting lots of attention.

978
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,820
Let's see what it's about.

979
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,500
Wait, what?

980
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,140
Is it this?

981
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,860
Make.

982
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,960
Okay, so if I put white bean paste...

983
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,360
And then...

984
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,360
Looks good.

985
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,120
Then I get white bean paste dorayaki!

986
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,300
Alright, I wanna...

987
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,360
I wanna do...

988
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,460
I wanna do popularity.

989
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,060
That's it, make it popular!

990
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,220
Nobody requested this, but like...

991
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,280
Who cares?

992
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,000
I want it.

993
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,240
Hold a tasting event or presentation.

994
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,080
You can also just...

995
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,280
To do so, tap auto on the bottom left.

996
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,020
How do I make it more appealing?

997
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,600
Like...

998
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,020
Oh!

999
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,540
I like basically...

1000
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,140
Alright.

1001
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,740
Look at that red.

1002
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,160
And then...

1003
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,860
Do I have enough money?

1004
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,640
Oh, and now I'm gonna make it bougie.

1005
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,420
That's right.

1006
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,880
Oh my god!

1007
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,560
And then I'm gonna put...

1008
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,340
This on it.

1009
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,920
There we go.

1010
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,040
That looks great.

1011
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,200
Uh, massive!

1012
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,120
Thank you for the super chat!

1013
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,100
Thank you, thank you!

1014
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,640
There's a really touching fan manga...

1015
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,800
That said that Doraemon ran out of battery...

1016
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,440
But Future Factory couldn't fix him.

1017
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,300
So Nobita studied so hard...

1018
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,240
Becoming the leader scientist of the world...

1019
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,120
Just...

1020
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,280
Just for saving his friend.

1021
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,180
Oh my god, that sounds so sad!

1022
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,620
Thank you for the super chat, massive!

1023
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,820
Thank you, thank you!

1024
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:41,940
Alright.

1025
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,780
Nice, we got it.

1026
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,760
Makeover...

1027
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,220
We fulfilled...

1028
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,580
Wait, did we even fulfilled any requests?

1029
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,400
I was not.

1030
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:49,940
Any...

1031
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,320
Something good might happen.

1032
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,680
Hospitality for teacher?

1033
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,940
I wanna try the chestnut...

1034
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,920
Oh my god, am...

1035
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
You want me to do this pro bono?

1036
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,220
Hmm...

1037
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,420
To be fair...

1038
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:07,940
Nobita...

1039
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,300
Is failing in school.

1040
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,780
So like...

1041
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,220
So like, this might be good, guys.

1042
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,700
He is failing.

1043
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,440
What do I do putting chestnut though?

1044
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,180
Do I put red bean paste with it?

1045
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,080
Oh, I do!

1046
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,340
Oh my god, guys.

1047
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,600
I might be able to bribe him to get a better grade.

1048
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:36,740
Yay!

1049
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,640
Okay.

1050
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,500
Hold a taste event.

1051
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,560
Alright, what do you guys think?

1052
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,100
I might actually like it.

1053
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,500
Might become popular.

1054
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,920
I see potential.

1055
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,420
Homie, but in a good way.

1056
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,320
Teacher!

1057
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,640
I did it!

1058
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,640
You still can't a zero.

1059
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,820
Teacher!

1060
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,520
I made your favorite dorayaki!

1061
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,640
Please, my mom will actually...

1062
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:08,880
Oh, I...

1063
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,480
Wait, what?

1064
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,300
Did I just got an F?

1065
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,100
Yay!

1066
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,400
Enjoys five bean dorayaki, chestnut Mont Blanc, pink phone, and a Hearth Lounge.

1067
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,080
Alright, we got an F, but that's a...

1068
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,480
Oh my god!

1069
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,000
Girlfriend!

1070
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,200
I discovered a new story.

1071
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,780
So...

1072
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,580
This is...

1073
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,140
Uh...

1074
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:30,700
Suhong.

1075
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,240
This is Suzuka.

1076
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,260
Um...

1077
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,720
And basically...

1078
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,660
This is gonna be his future wife.

1079
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,580
Um...

1080
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,680
She could've married somebody better.

1081
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,480
I'm just saying.

1082
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,920
Before...

1083
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,580
Before...

1084
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,240
His great-grandson went and changed history...

1085
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,620
She was gonna be married...

1086
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,580
To like...

1087
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,360
She could absolutely do better.

1088
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,020
But she was originally...

1089
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,660
Gonna be married...

1090
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,920
To a guy...

1091
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,600
That was smart...

1092
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,740
Very successful...

1093
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,920
And like...

1094
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,840
Um...

1095
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,180
And was like...

1096
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,160
And very humble.

1097
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,200
But then...

1098
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,760
But then the great-grandson changed everything.

1099
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,180
And...

1100
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:21,880
Also like...

1101
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,480
She sort of married him out of pity.

1102
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,040
He was like...

1103
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,440
She was the one that proposed to him.

1104
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,920
And he was like...

1105
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,380
Cause he...

1106
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,440
It was very pitiful.

1107
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,960
Cause he was like crying and was like...

1108
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,600
I love you!

1109
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,500
And then...

1110
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,980
Suzuka was like...

1111
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,580
And then she was like...

1112
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,700
I can fix him.

1113
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,980
I'll marry you, Nobita.

1114
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,520
So...

1115
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,580
So...

1116
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,640
That's basically how it happened.

1117
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,340
Huh?

1118
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,500
What are you doing, Nobita?

1119
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,040
Hi, Suzuka!

1120
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,560
We're helping out at this dorayaki store.

1121
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,200
That's what you're doing?

1122
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,360
On your spring break?

1123
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,280
Wow!

1124
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,080
Wait...

1125
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,680
You don't mean you're actually making sweets, do you?

1126
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,760
Massive thank you for the...

1127
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,840
Welcome to tomato farm.

1128
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,440
Welcome...

1129
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,380
Stop roasting Nobita!

1130
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,080
He's already gone through so much!

1131
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,400
I am...

1132
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,320
It turns out...

1133
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,520
I have talent for this.

1134
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,040
You can join us too, if you like.

1135
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,540
I'll show you how to do it.

1136
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,240
That's so cool!

1137
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,740
Count me in!

1138
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,460
But wait...

1139
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,480
Are you sure I won't be getting in the way?

1140
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,600
Of course not.

1141
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,580
It'll be great to have you on the team.

1142
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,260
Let's help out together until the owner gets better.

1143
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,400
If you really want me to join you...

1144
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,400
I guess I'll do it.

1145
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,120
You said the owner was unwell?

1146
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,300
Is this serious?

1147
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,640
Hello, young lady.

1148
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,980
Thank you for joining my helpers that totally get paid.

1149
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,000
Oh gosh, you're hurt!

1150
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,560
Shouldn't you be resting?

1151
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,360
Free labor!

1152
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,160
Yay!

1153
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,580
It's not as bad as it looks.

1154
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,800
I can manage most things without help.

1155
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,300
But it's impossible for me to cook.

1156
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,060
So these two are in charge making sweets right now.

1157
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,400
I see...

1158
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,800
Well, I'm happy to help too.

1159
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,060
Yay!

1160
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,620
I befriended Suzuka!

1161
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,520
Hey, Doraemon.

1162
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,760
Do you want to try making other types of dorayaki?

1163
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,060
Sure!

1164
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,540
But for that, we'll have to find new ingredients.

1165
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,160
I suppose we'll need this.

1166
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,180
The Anywhere Door!

1167
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,240
I wish this was real.

1168
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,920
I always wish that the Anywhere Door was a real thing.

1169
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,800
Alright, where do we put the Anywhere Door though?

1170
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,760
I guess since it can go anywhere, I can put it anywhere.

1171
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,620
Let's just put it in the backyard.

1172
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,700
Yeah, let's just put it here.

1173
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,460
With this, we'll never be short-staffed again.

1174
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,480
Oh my god!

1175
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,840
And I get a copy bot?

1176
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,420
All of this for one fucking store?

1177
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,900
We can send a copy bot to search for ingredients for us instead of tasking staff members with it.

1178
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,240
Yeah, basically the Anywhere Door is a fast travel door.

1179
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,240
You think of where you want to go, and then you go there.

1180
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,700
Alright, let's go and search for ingredients.

1181
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,900
But where can we do that?

1182
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,640
Leave it to me, Nobita.

1183
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,480
Beep beep!

1184
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,020
I found a place nearby that's perfect for ingredient searching.

1185
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,700
A new ingredient nearby open space.

1186
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,280
Let's go right away!

1187
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,100
Let's use the Anywhere Door to go and search for ingredients.

1188
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,020
Okay, how do I...

1189
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,280
I don't want to do that.

1190
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:11,630
Wait, training?

1191
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,590
Wait, how do I...

1192
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:16,890
Oh, it's right here!

1193
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,190
Send out staff to look for ingredients.

1194
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,450
You'll be able to find more types of ingredients when you lock new destination.

1195
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,670
Alright, we'll get...

1196
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,670
Nobita, because...

1197
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,770
I feel like Nobita, because he has five.

1198
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,530
I don't know what the five means, but I assume...

1199
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,550
I assume it's good.

1200
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,530
Alright!

1201
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,990
Go and find me!

1202
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,000
That's right!

1203
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,620
Go and get food!

1204
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,240
Alright, customer's request.

1205
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,960
Oh, that's him!

1206
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,160
Dekisugi!

1207
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,520
That's him, right?

1208
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,520
That was...

1209
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,620
That was like Suzuka's actual husband.

1210
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:02,740
Yeah!

1211
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,980
Okay, that's him.

1212
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,760
He's the guy that...

1213
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,580
He's the guy...

1214
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,280
That she was supposed to marry.

1215
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,960
He was gonna become a scientist.

1216
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,200
I don't remember if it was like a scientist or a doctor.

1217
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,300
I'd like to see that new sweet story, but I feel awkward going to new places.

1218
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,380
Do I have one?

1219
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,040
Oh wait, I don't have brown sugar.

1220
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:24,800
No, I don't.

1221
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,040
Do I have this?

1222
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,580
Oh, I don't have this.

1223
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,160
Maybe you can make your recipes even better if you had a food lab.

1224
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,700
Did you like...

1225
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,920
I like how Doraemon...

1226
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,020
Like, mailed that request instead of telling it to me to my face.

1227
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,820
It's like a ominous letter...

1228
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:42,880
But from Doraemon.

1229
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,240
I wasn't sure there was something there, but I couldn't find it.

1230
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,280
We might need to do more training.

1231
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,480
Open the menu and go to helpers and then training to work on improving exploration stat.

1232
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,200
Okay.

1233
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,280
I have to do...

1234
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,040
What do I have to do?

1235
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:03,780
How do I do this?

1236
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,280
Helpers, training...

1237
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,680
Oh, it goes...

1238
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,440
Okay, exploration.

1239
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,320
Alright, everybody.

1240
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,540
By being better at yo-yo, you'll be better at exploring, apparently.

1241
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,560
We tried our best.

1242
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:18,920
Okay.

1243
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,340
And then, let's just do like...

1244
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,020
Kodama, too.

1245
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,260
The ting-tong dip.

1246
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,270
Alright, now you should be able to...

1247
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:34,970
Now you should be able to get more ingredients, right?

1248
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,490
Oh, there he is.

1249
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,510
He's still getting ingredients.

1250
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,490
Okay, save complete.

1251
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,210
I need a build facility.

1252
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,630
Wait, I don't have it.

1253
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:48,970
I don't have...

1254
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,630
I don't have a food lab.

1255
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,610
How do I build a food lab, though?

1256
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,110
Okay, let's make...

1257
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,110
I need to make a...

1258
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,730
Brown sugar patty, yeah.

1259
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,350
And then...

1260
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,410
Red bean paste.

1261
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:01,370
Is that not it?

1262
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:03,630
Brown sugar toriyaki!

1263
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,290
Wait, fanciness!

1264
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,190
What does the fanciness do?

1265
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,310
Make it fancy!

1266
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:12,230
A woman touched it!

1267
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,350
There you go.

1268
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,110
Now that...

1269
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,170
A very pretty girl touched it...

1270
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:20,530
It should be...

1271
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,910
It should be extra fancy.

1272
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,510
Promising, yes.

1273
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:25,970
There's a niche to it.

1274
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,330
It's subtle.

1275
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,630
Only in a good way.

1276
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,150
Oh my god!

1277
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,990
Look, I got your favorite food!

1278
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,230
Instant markup.

1279
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,730
The customer found something they like!

1280
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,550
Handmade by...

1281
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:44,730
Female.

1282
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:46,670
Yay!

1283
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:47,930
Yay!

1284
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:52,290
Enjoys a futuristic lounge in a book...

1285
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,350
Am I gonna add a bookstore to my...

1286
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:55,650
Fucking...

1287
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:56,110
We're not...

1288
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:57,410
We don't want loiters here.

1289
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:03,150
I don't want any loiters!

1290
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:04,090
Oh, nice.

1291
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,210
Okay, I got memories.

1292
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:07,210
Can I train even more?

1293
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,370
Slime play?

1294
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:10,490
The fuck am I gonna do with slime play?

1295
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,670
Getting creative with slime!

1296
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,170
How does this improve staff work?

1297
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,790
Shooting practice?

1298
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,630
Doraemon, I had this idea.

1299
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,810
Why don't we offer drinks to the customers who have their sweets at the table?

1300
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,910
That really is a great idea, Suzuka.

1301
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:33,830
This is guaranteed to improve customer satisfaction.

1302
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,510
I hope so.

1303
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,270
We'll need to set up a drinks corner.

1304
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:41,010
I found this big book while looking for ingredients.

1305
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,750
It seems there's something on the other side of it.

1306
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,670
Someone's inside the book.

1307
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:47,650
Let's open it.

1308
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,490
It won't budge!

1309
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:51,090
What?

1310
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,410
Is this for real?

1311
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,670
I can see something on the other side of the book.

1312
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,170
I may be able to connect to the...

1313
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:00,810
What?

1314
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:05,390
To the Kiteretsu Encyclopedia world?

1315
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:06,610
What?

1316
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,650
What?

1317
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:10,270
What am I...

1318
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:11,550
There's...

1319
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,470
I'm just inviting the multiverse.

1320
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:14,590
Oh, okay.

1321
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:16,690
You're part of the world now.

1322
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,690
The book's other side...

1323
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,830
Oh, I remember this!

1324
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,530
I remember the rabbit!

1325
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:28,230
Oh!

1326
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,970
A path to the other side of the book has opened.

1327
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,170
Let's check it out.

1328
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,190
Doraemon into the multiverse.

1329
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,150
Where is this?

1330
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:42,310
It's not the past.

1331
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:43,550
It's not in space.

1332
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,370
It's like...

1333
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:45,330
My town.

1334
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:46,650
But different somehow.

1335
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,910
Metai-san, thank you for the super chat.

1336
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:49,830
Thank you, thank you.

1337
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,810
Bird noises to make my day better.

1338
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:52,690
Thank you for streaming.

1339
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,190
This does seem to be one of my ancestors' inventions.

1340
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,350
Nice to meet you.

1341
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:00,450
I'm Doraemon.

1342
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,930
It seems we speak the same language.

1343
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:04,310
Hello.

1344
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,290
My name's Ichikikai.

1345
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,070
You can call me Kiteretsu.

1346
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,430
Sorry, but can you tell me what this place is?

1347
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,330
It resembles my town, but it's different.

1348
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,690
Well, I don't fully understand this yet either.

1349
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,570
But it seems a strange book connected our world to yours.

1350
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,710
We're so desperate for money...

1351
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:33,030
That we're, like, grabbing people from multiverses to fucking eat from our store.

1352
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:34,070
What?

1353
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:34,650
Really?

1354
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,490
I wonder how it works.

1355
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,430
This is actually super interesting.

1356
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:43,310
So Doraemon, is it okay if I come visit you here again?

1357
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:44,390
Sure.

1358
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,390
We're helping out the Doriaki store.

1359
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,630
Come and check it out anytime.

1360
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,770
And make sure to spend your money here.

1361
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:51,150
Thanks.

1362
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,290
I might bring some friends along next time.

1363
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:54,270
See you.

1364
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:00,670
It's like a dream come true to connect to a world that even a time machine can't reach.

1365
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:03,210
Thank you so much for connecting us.

1366
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,910
Yay, more customers.

1367
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,100
Oh my god, we got your Doriaki in here.

1368
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,110
Yay!

1369
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,430
More customers!

1370
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:17,950
Alright.

1371
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,250
Now we have 10 customers.

1372
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:23,630
Is he still collecting?

1373
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,550
Holy shit.

1374
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,910
Okay, what does...

1375
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:28,750
I think you could use it.

1376
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,830
Okay, maybe we'll do that instead.

1377
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,290
Alright.

1378
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,090
We're gonna get a drink corner anyway.

1379
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,650
We have so much money.

1380
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,150
It'll be fine, guys.

1381
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,450
We have so much money.

1382
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,770
We're not gonna go broke.

1383
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:43,550
Okay, so...

1384
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,410
I have...

1385
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,590
I can make another Doriaki.

1386
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,850
Black sesame with red bean paste.

1387
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:53,190
Huh?

1388
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:54,530
No!

1389
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,890
Okay, black sesame with white bean paste.

1390
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,290
What?

1391
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,750
Where do I put the...

1392
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,630
Can I try again?

1393
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:07,060
But...

1394
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,090
I don't have anything else.

1395
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,910
Black bean paste.

1396
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:16,320
No...

1397
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:18,160
No...

1398
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,370
I...

1399
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:22,370
I wasted so much money.

1400
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,950
I got the food lab.

1401
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:31,950
I wasted so much money to make...

1402
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:34,010
I didn't know.

1403
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,030
Already reflected.

1404
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,150
I got an encyclopedia.

1405
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:41,710
Oh, that's from the book!

1406
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,270
I get to go to the park with a pun?

1407
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:45,730
Alright.

1408
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:49,990
This looks like searching for ingredients will continue to be the key to creating a new sweet future.

1409
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:50,830
Alright.

1410
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:52,890
Go in there.

1411
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,010
Okay, who has the most search?

1412
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:56,590
Nearby open space.

1413
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:56,890
Wait!

1414
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:59,030
I get to talk to a guy.

1415
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,210
Okay, but like...

1416
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,770
I want to talk to him.

1417
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,090
He might be a new customer.

1418
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,270
Go and find me more ingredients, me!

1419
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:10,910
Alright.

1420
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,270
Teacher request?

1421
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:16,150
Okay, first we got to build a drink corner though.

1422
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,090
Okay, the food lab.

1423
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,090
First we got to build the food lab first.

1424
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:24,990
If you run out of ingredients, you can go shopping for them.

1425
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:28,290
Open the menu and go to match and then select shop.

1426
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:29,070
Oh!

1427
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:30,670
I can buy ingredients!

1428
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,570
I can buy a fishing rod?

1429
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:35,150
Okay, I think...

1430
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,350
I should buy a fishing rod.

1431
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,030
Oh, I have two.

1432
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:37,950
Okay, um...

1433
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:38,810
Oops, that's...

1434
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:39,530
Oh, that's awkward.

1435
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,290
I was not paying attention.

1436
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:42,590
That is...

1437
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,230
Now I have two fishing rods!

1438
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,730
I mean, you can get mushrooms at the park.

1439
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,250
Oh yeah, that's my bully.

1440
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,150
That's Nobita's bully.

1441
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,330
Who sometimes works with him.

1442
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,710
And our friends, I don't know.

1443
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:04,430
Their relationship...

1444
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:06,490
They have a weird situation right now.

1445
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:07,510
Um...

1446
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:08,130
Hey, Nobita!

1447
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:09,410
What are you up to?

1448
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,830
Errands for grown-ups?

1449
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,250
Daifan...

1450
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,170
Like, we call him...

1451
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,150
In Cantonese, it's daifanshu.

1452
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:17,490
Which is like...

1453
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:18,470
Big yam.

1454
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:20,390
Um...

1455
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,890
And you, helping out at your mom's store...

1456
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,490
He's like part-time bully, you know?

1457
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,390
He's like...

1458
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,330
Yeah, as usual.

1459
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,850
Doraemon...

1460
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:35,490
Let's not tell Jen about the...

1461
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,210
Doraeki store.

1462
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,110
What are you whispering about?

1463
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,470
Don't ignore me.

1464
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:43,550
You trying to ignore me?

1465
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,230
You probably don't have much to do anyway.

1466
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:46,730
Right?

1467
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:49,230
Come help at my mom's store too.

1468
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:51,550
What?

1469
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:53,850
Sorry, but we can't.

1470
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:56,030
We got hands full helping at the Doraeki store.

1471
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:56,590
Oops.

1472
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,430
What was that?

1473
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:59,730
A Doraeki store?

1474
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,890
Now you gotta tell me more.

1475
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,140
Okay, guys.

1476
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,140
Mom said I'm free to help at the Doraeki store too.

1477
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,020
Doraemon...

1478
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,600
This is your fault.

1479
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,360
Well, it can't hurt to have more volunteers.

1480
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,880
I have a feeling we'll be getting busy.

1481
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,520
Welcome to the team, Jen.

1482
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,080
Thanks.

1483
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,620
I bet it'll be more fun than my mom's store anyway.

1484
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,780
Alright, so now we have my part-time bully helping me.

1485
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,660
Bully who loves singing?

1486
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,620
Yeah, I don't know.

1487
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,640
It's weird.

1488
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,000
They have a weird situation thing going on.

1489
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,480
I don't know.

1490
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,340
I don't know what really is going on up there.

1491
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,800
Part-time bully.

1492
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,340
Full-time worker.

1493
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,420
Yeah, he can't sing.

1494
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,300
He loves singing.

1495
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,280
And like, part of his bully torture...

1496
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,760
Is to literally...

1497
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,560
Is to just sing to them.

1498
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,020
And that's how like...

1499
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,620
That's like apparently torture too.

1500
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,000
Alright.

1501
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:10,880
Nice.

1502
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,780
The food lab is complete.

1503
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,740
What do I do?

1504
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,940
Oh, we can improve our existing recipes.

1505
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,800
Go ahead and make your sweets even more delicious.

1506
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,880
I can prime it?

1507
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,620
We'll try it out once we decide who should be assigned to the lab.

1508
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,420
Oh.

1509
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:28,660
Okay.

1510
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,880
Oh, we got a drink corner too!

1511
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,540
Okay, how do I assign this?

1512
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:34,540
Shop.

1513
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:36,480
Wait.

1514
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,000
Yodoba store?

1515
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,980
Oh, we haven't found it yet.

1516
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,100
How do I...

1517
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,460
Make your selection?

1518
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,000
Select staff.

1519
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,100
Oh, okay.

1520
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:46,800
Um...

1521
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,060
Let's put...

1522
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:48,540
You know what?

1523
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,160
I trust my bully there.

1524
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:51,280
We'll put...

1525
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,340
We'll put Jin in charge of the food lab.

1526
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,620
He seems like he knows a lot about food.

1527
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,160
Um...

1528
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:58,720
You know what?

1529
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,440
We'll improve...

1530
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,160
We'll do...

1531
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:02,600
The classic.

1532
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,700
Oh, we can improve everything!

1533
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,720
We'll do all of it!

1534
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,240
Alright.

1535
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:09,940
Uh...

1536
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,420
They're looking for...

1537
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,040
Tongari.

1538
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,120
Who's Tongari?

1539
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,420
Who's that guy?

1540
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,960
Oh, Ji...

1541
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,800
Ji...

1542
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,300
Jian?

1543
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,200
Is that how you pronounce his name?

1544
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:27,620
I just know him by his Cantonese name, so a lot of the names are new for me.

1545
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,420
Okay, how do I make this?

1546
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,160
Whipped cream.

1547
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,700
He likes bean paste butter.

1548
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,540
Could really use a new folding screen.

1549
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,020
You know what?

1550
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:36,500
Fuck it.

1551
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,220
I'm so rich.

1552
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,400
I literally have 93,000 G's.

1553
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,340
Fuck it.

1554
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,360
Let's just build everything!

1555
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,060
What's wrong?

1556
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,200
What could go wrong?

1557
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,660
Having children make the financial decisions of this...

1558
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,860
Of this store?

1559
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,440
What could go wrong?

1560
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,140
What could go wrong?

1561
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,280
My homework's so hard.

1562
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,580
I can't do it.

1563
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,680
Do you know anyone who can explain it to me?

1564
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:09,900
Alright.

1565
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,100
As a fellow child, I can help you do your homework.

1566
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,200
Alright.

1567
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,700
Oh my god, we should get the other child to do it.

1568
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,480
If the teacher finds out, it'd be pretty bad.

1569
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:22,880
Alright.

1570
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:27,600
Nice.

1571
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,440
I'm gonna make sure...

1572
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,060
I'm gonna make my future wife in charge of this.

1573
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,800
Wait, does she get paid?

1574
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,120
What do you mean?

1575
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,020
I...

1576
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:45,420
What?

1577
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,240
I thought we're paying to buy with Dorayaki!

1578
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,420
This is a scam!

1579
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,340
Those children told me they'd work for Dorayaki!

1580
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,560
How fucking dare they!

1581
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:07,600
They told me they would work for Dorayaki!

1582
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,100
What happened to my Dorayaki?

1583
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,380
Dorayaki salary!

1584
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,740
It's the name of a store.

1585
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,640
Yeah, it's a name!

1586
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,800
It doesn't mean...

1587
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,100
It doesn't mean that...

1588
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,280
Alright, let's see.

1589
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:31,720
I'm gonna make him...

1590
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,720
I'm gonna do Pawn next.

1591
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,940
I feel like...

1592
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:36,180
I'm gonna do Pawn next.

1593
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,220
Cause like, I'm tired of trying to find this guy.

1594
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,680
Report from the food lab.

1595
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,520
Did I make a better Dorayaki?

1596
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,900
Plus 6, plus 4, plus 3!

1597
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:49,540
Yay!

1598
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,860
My Dorayaki tastes better now!

1599
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,400
Oh shit.

1600
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,720
Improvement results, plus 3, plus 2.

1601
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,400
What about him?

1602
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:00,940
Oh wait.

1603
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,740
The teacher likes...

1604
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:07,380
What was it?

1605
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,860
It was the walnut, right?

1606
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:10,480
Chestnut?

1607
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,760
Yeah, it was the chestnut.

1608
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,000
Oh, I can...

1609
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,720
Wait, what the fuck am I gonna do with my fishing rod?

1610
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,900
I don't even know what to do with my fishing rod.

1611
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,320
Oh, I found whipped cream!

1612
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:25,700
Nice.

1613
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,860
I remember one of them really liked...

1614
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,900
They really liked...

1615
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,900
Oh, I should put more seats too.

1616
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,180
I should add another seating arrangement.

1617
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,200
Seating for two.

1618
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:40,720
Uh...

1619
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,000
Where do I put it though?

1620
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,060
Maybe here?

1621
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,200
Maybe I'll put it here, yeah.

1622
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:46,520
More seating.

1623
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:47,980
Can they access this?

1624
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:49,760
Oh, wait.

1625
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:51,700
Uh...

1626
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,120
Oh, I can buy a folding screen!

1627
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,180
Wait, actually I don't think they can access this.

1628
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:56,380
Yay!

1629
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,760
Oh, I met a girl!

1630
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:04,010
It looks like they've safely found who they were looking for.

1631
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:05,770
Yay!

1632
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:06,870
New customer!

1633
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:12,150
Oh my god, look at my profit margins.

1634
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,370
I've got four customers, guys.

1635
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,590
That's all my store needs.

1636
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:19,910
My store only needs four customers to keep everything running.

1637
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:24,970
Whoops, sorry.

1638
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:27,030
That's all I need.

1639
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,490
That's how you run a successful business.

1640
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,790
Just four is all I need.

1641
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:33,230
I will move this.

1642
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,310
Let's make the most of today.

1643
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,050
Oh, I got dough!

1644
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,590
Make a sweet treat using Daifuku dough.

1645
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:46,630
Okay, I should be able to make new ingredients now.

1646
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:47,870
Right?

1647
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:50,070
Whipped cream.

1648
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:51,990
And red bean paste.

1649
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:54,170
Yeah!

1650
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:55,510
Whipped cream toriyaki!

1651
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,990
When am I gonna go public?

1652
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:00,610
Oh, get my vibes up!

1653
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:01,250
Jian.

1654
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:01,510
Jian.

1655
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:04,510
That's right.

1656
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:06,910
Glaze it up!

1657
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:09,010
Hold a tasting event.

1658
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:10,730
Yeah, what do you guys think?

1659
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:13,650
Promising, yes.

1660
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:15,570
It grows on you.

1661
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,050
I see a potential for this.

1662
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:19,730
An affordable treat.

1663
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:22,010
When can I start raising my prices?

1664
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,410
That's right, that's all I need.

1665
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:30,350
As long as I have those four people keep buying my toriyaki, that's alright.

1666
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,210
Alright, he likes Ruth's menu board.

1667
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:35,590
Okay.

1668
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,310
I got a scene for two!

1669
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:39,510
Another big book?

1670
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:41,930
Does this lead to some other mysterious world?

1671
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:45,600
Oh!

1672
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:49,020
The books are like the crossover episodes to like...

1673
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,980
The other stories, like the movie ones.

1674
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,340
Is this for real?

1675
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,680
I can see something on the other side of the book!

1676
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,940
Connect me to them!

1677
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,900
I need more customers!

1678
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,560
Get me in the multiverse!

1679
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,340
Uh, Chim?

1680
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,500
I have no idea.

1681
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,400
Who the fuck is Chimpure?

1682
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,840
Who are they?

1683
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,240
Oh, it's like an actual different...

1684
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,500
Wait, it's like a different...

1685
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,560
Oh, it's like his different works!

1686
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:24,450
It's like his older works.

1687
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:28,010
Yeah, the author's older works.

1688
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:32,450
Oh, it seems this leads to Earth?

1689
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:33,770
Fascinating.

1690
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,350
I'll report this to my friends from Planet Mal.

1691
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:39,710
Thank you so much for connecting us!

1692
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,770
Yes, new customers means...

1693
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:44,610
More money.

1694
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:47,230
Which means...

1695
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,410
More profit.

1696
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,030
What does this make?

1697
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:53,450
What is...

1698
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,090
Oh, it's mochi!

1699
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,870
Wait, I can even...

1700
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:58,570
Oh my God.

1701
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:01,550
I can even make mochi now, it's over.

1702
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:03,790
I have mochi.

1703
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,310
Hold a tasting event.

1704
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,070
Alright, what do you guys think about my mochi?

1705
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:13,870
Okay, technically they get paid now.

1706
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,870
So, like, I'm not breaching any...

1707
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:17,650
Any, like, illegal activity.

1708
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,510
Doraemon, what do we do?

1709
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:24,710
We actually made a sweet that's not dorayaki!

1710
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:29,770
This is supposed to be a dorayaki store.

1711
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:31,570
You fucked up, Nobita.

1712
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:33,930
Why can't you do anything correct?

1713
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:38,470
If it's tasty, why not try selling it?

1714
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:39,370
The whore.

1715
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:42,530
You had one job.

1716
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,390
And they're happy, it's all good, no?

1717
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:54,510
Oh my God, Doraemon is like...

1718
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:55,570
His heart is...

1719
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:59,010
This is supposed to be a specialist dorayaki store.

1720
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:03,070
If we let mochi in, then what are we gonna do next?

1721
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:04,450
Start selling pasta?

1722
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:11,810
Why limit ourselves and deprive our customers of your newly discovered sweet treat?

1723
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:12,950
Let's sell it!

1724
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:17,390
Daifuku's shelf can now be built.

1725
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:19,010
Alright, let's make a daifuku's...

1726
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:20,770
Oh my God, it's my mom!

1727
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:26,450
Although the children get paid has only recently opened...

1728
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:30,650
The number of customers visiting the store seems to be increasing rapidly.

1729
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:36,070
We managed to quickly interview one of the customers leaving the store with a beaming smile.

1730
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:41,450
The sweets are just as I like them, and a wonderful atmosphere keeps me coming in.

1731
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:48,690
It seems that the children get paid owes its good reputation not only to the quality of their products, but also the vibe of the store.

1732
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:54,090
One of the customers was like, it's great seeing children around here.

1733
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:55,610
Makes me feel young again.

1734
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:59,870
It goes to show just how important it is to have good facilities for customers to use.

1735
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:04,070
Make them happy, and you might find yourself getting a lot of valuable F points.

1736
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:06,850
Okay, I...

1737
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:08,030
What the fuck?

1738
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:09,370
My sister?

1739
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:10,610
Dorami?

1740
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:12,270
What are you doing here?

1741
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,430
Hello, Nobita.

1742
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:16,270
Sorry, mom.

1743
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:18,370
I brought you what you asked for.

1744
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:19,730
What the...

1745
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:20,730
That was quick.

1746
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:24,210
I asked Dorami to compile some tips about running the store.

1747
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:28,710
I arrange them by rank from the easiest to the hardest.

1748
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:34,650
Complete the objectives one by one, and you'll become a top-ranked store.

1749
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,350
Alright.

1750
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,570
Clear the ingredient searches.

1751
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:42,210
Get rid of opponents in your way?

1752
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:44,130
Am I gonna...

1753
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:44,550
What?

1754
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,270
Am I...

1755
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:49,170
Am I gonna fucking get a hit on somebody?

1756
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:50,370
Like...

1757
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:54,590
I see.

1758
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:57,170
Well, let's start with the objective for the first rank.

1759
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:04,190
You can check what the requirements are by opening the menu and going to manage and then rank up.

1760
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:07,470
By the way, what do you think about making the store bigger?

1761
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:11,950
I think it'll start feeling quite crap once you have a city full of customers.

1762
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:14,430
Well, I gotta go now.

1763
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:15,630
Best of luck.

1764
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:18,470
Why did I need my sister from the future to...

1765
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:21,870
To Google how to run the store?

1766
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:29,590
Oh, to be fair, this was like in the 70s to 80s.

1767
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:30,710
I'm pretty sure, right?

1768
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:31,750
This was like...

1769
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:33,150
Not even 70s, 80s.

1770
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,830
This was like before the internet...

1771
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:35,470
Okay, you know what?

1772
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:36,250
That makes sense.

1773
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:40,270
Google wasn't a thing yet, so I needed my sister to Google in the...

1774
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:47,110
I called my sister to Google for me on how to run a successful store.

1775
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,130
And then she came back.

1776
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:51,270
She printed Wikipedia...

1777
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,650
No, she printed the...

1778
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,580
The how-to page.

1779
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:58,710
The wiki how page on how to run a store.

1780
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,350
And then gave it to me.

1781
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,180
Thanks, Doraemi.

1782
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,300
Bye.

1783
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,480
Doraemi's right.

1784
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,400
We could use a bigger store.

1785
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,600
And have just a gadget for it.

1786
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,740
Doraemi asked ChatGPD.

1787
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,520
I gotta expand the...

1788
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,200
Goodbye, homes.

1789
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,240
This is Doraemi.

1790
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,340
I'm gonna bulldoze this land.

1791
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,260
Wait, can I not?

1792
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,460
Wait, can I not take this over this?

1793
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,740
How do I use this?

1794
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:39,960
Goodbye.

1795
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,200
That's right.

1796
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,140
I destroyed several.

1797
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:54,560
I Thanos-snapped them and now they're gone.

1798
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,640
What happened?

1799
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:57,940
Where did they go?

1800
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,180
Wow.

1801
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,880
And then the children are like, that's so cool.

1802
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:09,560
Let's build an extra space with all sorts of facilities to make our customers happy.

1803
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:11,500
Good.

1804
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:14,040
Anything for Dorayaki.

1805
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,980
Alright, I should be able to build...

1806
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:21,560
Oh, there you go.

1807
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,840
I needed to build this.

1808
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,800
Eviction for Dorayaki.

1809
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,600
Oh my god, I got a lot of food there.

1810
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:32,240
What?

1811
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,420
Oh, I got the hill behind the school.

1812
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,360
Go again.

1813
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:38,200
Oh, wait.

1814
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:38,480
Okay.

1815
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:44,240
I don't know if I should, like, find this guy or not.

1816
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,500
Nah, we'll just explore.

1817
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,580
Let's find my dad.

1818
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:47,600
I think my dad's missing.

1819
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,720
Let's go find my dad.

1820
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:50,920
That's his dad, by the way.

1821
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,000
That's Nobita's dad.

1822
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,500
He hasn't came home.

1823
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,680
He's at the park at the open space and I think...

1824
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,220
I think I gotta find him.

1825
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,060
I need to build this shelf.

1826
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:04,680
Okay.

1827
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:05,820
There we go.

1828
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,200
Yay!

1829
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,380
Now my mom will acknowledge me!

1830
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,240
Oh my god!

1831
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,300
My mom now finally loves me!

1832
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:19,800
I'm not a failure in her eyes!

1833
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,440
Oh my god, finally!

1834
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,700
Also, it's really sad because Nobita's dad rarely comes home.

1835
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,420
Because he's always out drinking.

1836
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,440
And then he always comes home drunk as hell.

1837
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:40,100
And then his mom always has to be like, Why are you always drinking?

1838
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,080
And then, like, it's pretty fucked up.

1839
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:51,000
But then they make it as like a joke and everyone's like, Oh, there he is!

1840
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:52,400
Out drinking again!

1841
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,180
You got funds!

1842
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:58,520
Yay!

1843
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:02,880
Nice.

1844
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,420
Do I have anything new?

1845
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,300
Oh, I got the folding screen.

1846
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,180
Where do I put the folding screen though?

1847
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,320
Oh no, do I put it outside?

1848
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,980
What do I do with this?

1849
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,320
What is the purpose of a folding screen?

1850
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:19,320
I guess I can just put it here.

1851
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,400
Oh, it's just like reputation!

1852
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,060
I got a request!

1853
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,020
What does he want?

1854
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:27,880
Request.

1855
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,660
Oh wait, what kind of food?

1856
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,000
Okay, they want flan.

1857
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,960
Bean paste butter.

1858
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,540
Matcha.

1859
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,500
Oh, you're right, I should get a swing.

1860
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,560
Is he still doing her homework?

1861
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,560
How hard is his homework?

1862
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:48,960
How- Why am I still doing homework?

1863
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,120
What do I do with fishing rods?

1864
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,020
Oh, okay.

1865
01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:00,080
Oh, he's gonna buy two dorayakis now!

1866
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,180
Alright, I'll give it to my teacher too.

1867
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:04,980
Nice.

1868
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,700
Oh my god, I found my dad.

1869
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:09,880
I'm gonna find my dad.

1870
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:10,360
Dad!

1871
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,400
Oh my god, I'm getting rich.

1872
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,740
Oh my god, do you see that?

1873
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:30,520
Oh my god, you finally finished your homework!

1874
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:31,920
How did that turn out?

1875
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,420
Tutored a student expertly.

1876
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,860
So that homework was completed with- It's been- It's been- He's been gone?

1877
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,220
I just need you guys to know this.

1878
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,400
He's been gone for three weeks.

1879
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:46,280
Like, I- I don't know what was going on with that homework.

1880
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,480
Wait, what do I want?

1881
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,500
F points or money?

1882
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:53,860
I'll take F points, actually.

1883
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:59,180
I feel like F points is better.

1884
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,280
Dad!

1885
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:05,720
Oh, back to four months!

1886
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:06,380
Dad!

1887
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:17,010
Oh my god, we finally- It's been four months!

1888
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:18,830
Oh shit, Suni!

1889
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,190
I forgot what his name is in Cantonese.

1890
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,570
I always- I hated him the most.

1891
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:28,110
I actually forgot what his name was in Cantonese.

1892
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:31,650
And I've never seen his Japanese name before.

1893
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:34,070
It's- Ah, what was it?

1894
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,310
Suni- I don't know how to pronounce it.

1895
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:38,030
Uh, Sunio?

1896
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,110
Okay, yeah, he- Okay, so...

1897
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:41,190
Sufu?

1898
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:42,410
Is it Sufu?

1899
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:45,890
Um, okay, so...

1900
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:49,110
So- Alright, now you know why he's- He's very annoying.

1901
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,270
I'm going to the department store with my dad!

1902
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,910
He's gonna buy me a new RC card!

1903
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:56,110
Okay, alright, so...

1904
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:58,050
Um...

1905
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,130
Context behind Sunio...

1906
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,930
He is basically...

1907
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:04,490
The very annoying rich kid...

1908
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:06,330
Um, that brags about, like...

1909
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:08,130
All the new stuff he's getting...

1910
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,410
From, like, all the new shit he gets.

1911
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,230
Um, and like...

1912
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:14,450
He was, like, the bully's, like, henchman.

1913
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:15,110
Basically.

1914
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,970
So, like, if anything goes wrong...

1915
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:20,150
He always blames on Nobita.

1916
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:21,790
So, like, even if, like...

1917
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,590
Nobita didn't do it...

1918
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:26,070
Uh, the bully would be like...

1919
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:27,090
WHO DID THIS?!

1920
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,610
And then Sunio was like...

1921
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:30,350
It's Dai Hong!

1922
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:32,150
And then I'm like...

1923
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:36,130
He had no need to say that.

1924
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:39,940
Like...

1925
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,480
It's Nobita!

1926
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,780
He did it!

1927
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,180
But, like...

1928
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,220
He would just blame him for no reason.

1929
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,300
Yeah, he's a little rat.

1930
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,960
He's a fucking little rat.

1931
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,400
That's why I always forget his name.

1932
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,400
I never liked him.

1933
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,720
When in doubt, blame Nobita.

1934
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,920
Alright, what's your story?

1935
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:02,120
You little rat.

1936
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:03,640
Huh?

1937
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:04,580
Huh?

1938
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:05,960
You guys are all here.

1939
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,420
Hi, Sunio.

1940
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:10,020
What are you up to?

1941
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,720
Going to the department store with my dad.

1942
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:16,880
He's gonna buy me a new RC car.

1943
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,680
Oh, hey there, Sunio.

1944
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,020
Good to see you here.

1945
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:23,540
Jian!

1946
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:24,880
I...

1947
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,500
I gotta go.

1948
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,220
Bye!

1949
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,860
Aren't we lucky, Nobita.

1950
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,220
Sunio's gonna help us too.

1951
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:36,180
No, why do I get dragged into this?

1952
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:42,100
The moment I saw Jian, I knew this wouldn't end well for me.

1953
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:43,500
Wrecking!

1954
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,660
What's a wrecking?

1955
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,480
Can I hire somebody to do that for me?

1956
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:52,090
Yay!

1957
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,880
I wish I didn't befriend him, but yay!

1958
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:56,980
Boastful!

1959
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,560
Okay.

1960
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,640
A boastful narcissist.

1961
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:05,500
Okay.

1962
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,880
I did not expect that.

1963
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,680
From Doraemon.

1964
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:14,120
Alright.

1965
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,170
I got my boastful narcissist here.

1966
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,070
It's true.

1967
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:21,110
The worst.

1968
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,030
The lie.

1969
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:23,770
I did not... Damn.

1970
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:26,330
I did not expect him to, like...

1971
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:29,590
I did not expect him to actually, you know...

1972
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,770
Wait, let's do shooting practice.

1973
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,750
To, like, actually, you know, roast him like that.

1974
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:35,870
Yay!

1975
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:38,690
I feel like we can upgrade a lot of stuff.

1976
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:40,250
Oh, wait, this gives, like...

1977
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:45,690
Shooting practice gives the most upgrades, so I might as well just save up for shooting practice.

1978
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:48,750
Uh...

1979
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:49,920
And then...

1980
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:52,530
I'll just save up.

1981
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:55,910
I feel like shooting practice does the most anyway, so it's the best.

1982
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:58,070
Can I make anything new?

1983
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,270
I did red bean paste, right?

1984
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:03,410
I'll do white bean paste.

1985
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:06,650
And then black sesame?

1986
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:07,960
No!

1987
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:14,630
Which one to go for?

1988
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:16,450
We'll get F.

1989
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:18,750
F.

1990
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:19,250
F points.

1991
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,450
Yay!

1992
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:23,670
Yes.

1993
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:28,630
What can I make with...

1994
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:31,110
Red bean paste?

1995
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:32,310
What?

1996
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:36,570
Brown sugar?

1997
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:38,110
White bean paste?

1998
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:39,150
What?

1999
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:42,590
What do I do with it?

2000
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:42,670
What do I do with it?

2001
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:48,630
I give up.

2002
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:52,530
Uh...

2003
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:54,290
Oh, no, I can't.

2004
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,710
I already paid for it.

2005
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:58,570
I don't know.

2006
01:23:59,150 --> 01:23:59,870
I don't know.

2007
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:01,370
I never made mochi before.

2008
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,570
I don't know what people want.

2009
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:07,010
Have I not found...

2010
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:10,270
Wait, do I not have enough whipped cream?

2011
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,030
Doriaki primer?

2012
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:14,560
Chestnuts?

2013
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,290
I don't wanna...

2014
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:20,250
I don't wanna buy stuff.

2015
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:23,330
Okay, let's improve our Doriaki.

2016
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:26,990
Alright, nice.

2017
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:28,750
Oh, I got to build a swing now.

2018
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:29,910
Okay, build.

2019
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,210
Swing.

2020
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,090
Guys, I have a swing.

2021
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:36,870
Please come to my store.

2022
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:38,870
I have plus two rep.

2023
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:42,620
Oh my god.

2024
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,080
Why are they all so demanding?

2025
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,380
I have so many demands.

2026
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,200
What do you want?

2027
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,000
I could really... Fine.

2028
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,160
I have the money anyway.

2029
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:52,300
Alright, fine.

2030
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:52,840
That's cool.

2031
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:54,000
I can do that too.

2032
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,560
I don't have matcha, bean paste.

2033
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:57,440
I don't have butter.

2034
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,260
I don't have...

2035
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,240
Yamogi...

2036
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:02,900
Mochi?

2037
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,220
I need mochi dough.

2038
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:08,300
Mugwort?

2039
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,860
The fuck is that?

2040
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,960
Wait, flan is made of soy sauce?

2041
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:15,520
Okay, I need butter.

2042
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,260
Oh my god, I could've just looked at these recipes.

2043
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:19,900
Oh my god, I could've just looked at recipes.

2044
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:20,840
Why did I...

2045
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:24,180
Why did I try to...

2046
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:26,140
Why did I try to experiment?

2047
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:31,240
I actually wasted so much money for doing that.

2048
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:37,220
I wasted so much money experimenting on cooking.

2049
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:40,560
I don't have...

2050
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,160
I have to discover butter to get like...

2051
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,340
Oh, I found mugwort!

2052
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,680
Okay, what was the recipe again?

2053
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:51,720
Sweets...

2054
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,660
Okay, it's like customers...

2055
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,340
It was my dad.

2056
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,640
Mug... Oh, I need mochi dough.

2057
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,620
I don't have that.

2058
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,660
Manage... Memories...

2059
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,260
Okay, I acquired memories there.

2060
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,440
Is there anything I can...

2061
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:06,880
Improve?

2062
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:08,260
No?

2063
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,600
Uh... Training?

2064
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,660
Oh, I can... Oh, I don't have shooting practice.

2065
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:14,940
Uh...

2066
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,680
I don't think I can build anything though.

2067
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,720
I already...

2068
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,200
I guess I can put this in here.

2069
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:25,070
Okay.

2070
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:26,930
Now we wait.

2071
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:28,850
Oh, my mom asked for something.

2072
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:29,950
What does my mom want?

2073
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:32,650
I think your...

2074
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:34,090
Can use a lounge?

2075
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:36,590
I think your store could really use a...

2076
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:37,830
Anything for you, mother.

2077
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:39,830
I'll do anything.

2078
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:41,870
I just want my mother's love.

2079
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,990
Please love me, mom!

2080
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:45,250
Hahaha!

2081
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:47,370
Hello, everybody!

2082
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:48,450
Coming from the raid!

2083
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:50,150
My name is Doki Bird!

2084
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:52,730
Thank you, Mozul for the raid!

2085
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:56,510
Nice.

2086
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:56,750
Nice.

2087
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,850
Now my dorayaki is gonna taste even better.

2088
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:00,530
Okay.

2089
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:02,790
Uh...

2090
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:04,630
I don't know what...

2091
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,070
I don't know what this does.

2092
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:10,570
Oh, it just... Oh, it just says, like, their opinion on, like, my food.

2093
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:11,950
I see.

2094
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:13,790
Wait, what's this?

2095
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,510
There's one request that caught us up.

2096
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,230
Oh, I can build a tea room now!

2097
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:20,950
And a menu board!

2098
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,630
I found another big book!

2099
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:26,570
Oh!

2100
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:28,810
I know this one!

2101
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,330
This one's really old.

2102
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:32,990
Is this for real?

2103
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:35,130
I can see something on the other side of the book.

2104
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:37,330
It's Perman!

2105
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,190
Oh, that one's, like, one of his older works, too.

2106
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:44,770
Hello, Perman.

2107
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:49,090
You're connected to the universe of Perman!

2108
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:51,850
Where am I?

2109
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:54,790
It's a bit different from our town.

2110
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,030
Have I traveled to a different world?

2111
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:58,750
It looks so fun.

2112
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:00,530
I'll be coming here again.

2113
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:01,510
More customers!

2114
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:05,890
Oh my god, that's what I like to see.

2115
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:08,510
More customers equals more money!

2116
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,040
I'd like there to be more drinks on the menu.

2117
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,420
What does he want?

2118
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,580
Okay, I don't know.

2119
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,980
I don't know how to make that, sir.

2120
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,040
That's a little funky for me.

2121
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,920
I don't even know how to make that.

2122
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:31,480
Alright, customers, items, charm up...

2123
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,220
Wait, what?

2124
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,780
What's this items?

2125
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,880
Try using it on a facility?

2126
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,220
I mean, I could just increase my parasol.

2127
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,940
Now it's 25.

2128
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,200
You know what?

2129
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:49,620
Yes, increase it even more.

2130
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,260
Now it's 28.

2131
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:52,120
I might as well.

2132
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,760
Oh, I could...

2133
01:28:54,760 --> 01:29:02,220
I didn't realize if I read more of it, it would tell me what it increases for.

2134
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,680
Oh my god.

2135
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,500
I forgot to read.

2136
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:09,820
I forgot to read properly.

2137
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,180
Alright, uh...

2138
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,420
I think he would like it more.

2139
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,200
Yay!

2140
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,780
Now he's gonna buy more!

2141
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,080
Oh my god!

2142
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,980
He invented another customer!

2143
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:31,500
Yippee!

2144
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,520
He invented another customer to buy more!

2145
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,940
Alright, I can build a hearth lounge.

2146
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,240
Oh, and then a tea room.

2147
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,120
Wait, I should build that.

2148
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,020
Okay, I'll build this here.

2149
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,020
And then...

2150
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:59,080
Oh, nice!

2151
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,500
I got sky plaza!

2152
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,320
Go again!

2153
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,380
Wait, hopter is required for...

2154
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:11,380
Oh, I don't have the...

2155
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,880
What do you mean I don't have it?

2156
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,100
Like...

2157
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:16,240
Go there, right?

2158
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,000
What?

2159
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:19,400
What?

2160
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:23,160
Okay, the hopter is like...

2161
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:24,820
It's like a famous tool.

2162
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,200
A famous gadget.

2163
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,600
Where like, you fly around with it.

2164
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,960
I'm like, what do you mean I do not have it?

2165
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:35,240
Oh, okay, I had to send them away for repairs.

2166
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,000
This time we'll have to buy them from the future department store.

2167
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,700
Oh, by the way, you'll need this when you go to the future department store.

2168
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,520
I got future coins!

2169
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,380
Shall we see what they have?

2170
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,920
Okay, we got the future department store.

2171
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:56,350
Alright, Mr. Future.

2172
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:58,990
I need...

2173
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:00,190
Oh my god.

2174
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:01,790
I know I could buy...

2175
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,690
Okay, but like, what if...

2176
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:05,310
What if I buy this instead?

2177
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:06,030
I'm...

2178
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:11,370
I know...

2179
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,770
Guys, I know...

2180
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:16,370
Look, I know I needed to buy the...

2181
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:20,070
The hopter, but like...

2182
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:22,010
What if I buy this instead though?

2183
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:22,210
Oh...

2184
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:25,010
Okay, good.

2185
01:31:25,090 --> 01:31:25,970
I can still afford it.

2186
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:27,170
And I'll buy the... Oh!

2187
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:28,390
The memory bread.

2188
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:34,710
I used to be so obsessed with this, and like, I would I would dream about this being real.

2189
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:39,910
I would dream and like, fantasize about like, I wish this bread would be real.

2190
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:46,150
And then like, in my imagination, I'd just be like, god, if this bread was real, my life would be so easy.

2191
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,650
What does this do?

2192
01:31:47,930 --> 01:32:00,350
So the memory bread is literally, you write down something you need to learn, like basically something you need to learn on a test, and like memorize it, and then you eat that bread and then you basically remember it forever.

2193
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:06,320
Alright, I'm back from the future.

2194
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:08,880
Oh, hello!

2195
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:09,740
How are you?

2196
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:10,940
Wait, is this my great-grandson?

2197
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,180
How are you, Doraemon?

2198
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,580
Doraemon, you told me you're helping out at the dorayaki store.

2199
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,120
Hello, Sawashi.

2200
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,060
It's nice to see you.

2201
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:20,120
Hello.

2202
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:25,980
I'm actually looking for some secret gadgets that could be useful at the dorayaki store.

2203
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:29,420
How about this, Doraemon?

2204
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,240
I can lend it to you.

2205
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:32,680
Doraemi?

2206
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:33,840
I didn't know...

2207
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,400
Oh my god, look, don't ever talk to me or my son again.

2208
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:37,700
Doraemi?

2209
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,320
I didn't know you were coming.

2210
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,980
You'll let me borrow the mini Doraemon?

2211
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,060
Oh no, he's stupid.

2212
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:55,560
He's saying he'll be happy to help out at the dorayaki store.

2213
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:59,280
Now I'm curious what that dorayaki store is like.

2214
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:03,720
You know, great-grandpa never talks about it, so clearly...

2215
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:07,280
So I think something happened, Doraemon.

2216
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,300
He's my special little man.

2217
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:12,780
We're back!

2218
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,480
I got mini Doraemon!

2219
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,160
Mini Doraemon will be useful at the store.

2220
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,860
What does he do?

2221
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:26,160
But like, what does he...

2222
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,200
What does he do?

2223
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:35,920
The famous inventor, Kaito Iechi, has finally succeeded in developing the robot of his dreams.

2224
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:41,540
In an interview with a magazine, Kaito says enthusiastically, I've named the robot Kurosuki.

2225
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,820
It feels amazing I've constructed this robot at last.

2226
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,200
This has nothing to do with me.

2227
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,080
Why is the staff here?

2228
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:54,160
Why is the dorayaki staff who agreed to be photographed?

2229
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,380
Like, why are we here?

2230
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:59,620
This isn't even a story about us!

2231
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:05,380
They're like, anyway, here's a picture of the staff of the dorayaki store.

2232
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,620
It has nothing to do with this mess.

2233
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:09,540
Genius!

2234
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:28,000
It's like we have an interview of a scientist who like maybe invented a cure for cancer and then next to the picture was like here's the staff at a KFC who agreed to be photographed.

2235
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,580
Wait, who's that?

2236
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:32,920
Who's he?

2237
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:36,100
Nice to meet you.

2238
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:40,000
I'm here with a request for the children to get paid.

2239
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,840
Could we use the children get paid sweets as prizes for the neighborhood raffle?

2240
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:46,220
Yeah, let's do it!

2241
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,940
Alright, uh...

2242
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:49,520
I feel like classic dorayaki.

2243
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,300
I mean, you can't go bad with a classic.

2244
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:59,040
It could be a place where customers just hang out and relax in the fresh air.

2245
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:00,200
Why not?

2246
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,740
But don't sneak out there during work hours.

2247
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,360
No way I won't do that.

2248
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,540
Let's get that baking lot set up then.

2249
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,400
What am I...

2250
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,420
What does that come here?

2251
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:14,400
Do...

2252
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:18,920
Build...

2253
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:19,840
Uh...

2254
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:23,480
Where is... Oh, tea room!

2255
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:25,000
Yeah, I wanted to make the tea room.

2256
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,080
I'll put it like...

2257
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:29,740
here.

2258
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,340
Or like, should I just put it... I don't know.

2259
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,360
Do I just put it like...

2260
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,500
Maybe I'll put it...

2261
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:42,660
I'll put it here and then start...

2262
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:44,920
No, I feel like I could put it here.

2263
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,600
And then I'll like, expand the pathway.

2264
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,360
Yeah, and then...

2265
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:54,100
A path from the store.

2266
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:54,660
We need like...

2267
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:56,040
Okay, I can make a path.

2268
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,140
Guys, I...

2269
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:00,180
Please, there's so many updates.

2270
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:01,940
Okay, corridor.

2271
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:02,120
Door.

2272
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,040
There we go.

2273
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:06,880
Boop.

2274
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,780
How do I... Oh, there we go.

2275
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:09,940
And then...

2276
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:12,280
Please.

2277
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:13,760
Please!

2278
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:14,440
Okay, there we go.

2279
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:14,900
We did it.

2280
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:16,060
Easy.

2281
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:20,080
That's one request to cross off our list.

2282
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:20,580
Nice.

2283
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:21,580
Yeah!

2284
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,080
I got lemon juice!

2285
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:24,300
And orange juice!

2286
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:26,080
And acerola juice!

2287
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,460
Make my juice.

2288
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:29,860
How do I make juice?

2289
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:33,060
How to make juice?

2290
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:35,180
Hello?

2291
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:36,400
Oh, drink cereal.

2292
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,620
I feel like...

2293
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:42,740
You don't need to be happy.

2294
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:47,720
You don't need to be happy.

2295
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,580
I need my F.

2296
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:53,780
I need my F points.

2297
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:56,960
Okay, can I make this yet?

2298
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,000
Okay, I have money.

2299
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,280
I don't need to worry about that.

2300
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:04,120
Oh yeah, what does he like?

2301
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,520
Syrup and mo...

2302
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,400
Dude, I don't have any of those ingredients.

2303
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,540
Like, what do you want from me?

2304
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,600
What does my son want?

2305
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,940
Or my great-grandson want?

2306
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:19,400
Oh, I found a missing child!

2307
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,940
Oh no, he's looking for another missing...

2308
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:26,620
My missing child is looking for another child.

2309
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,940
Alright, well, I don't know where he is.

2310
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:30,400
I'm sorry.

2311
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:33,200
What the fuck does Mini-Mi do?

2312
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:34,660
Is he just walking around?

2313
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:36,240
Like, what is your purpose?

2314
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:38,920
I don't know what...

2315
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,240
I don't know what Mini-Mi's purpose is.

2316
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,740
He's just walking around.

2317
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,520
Okay, I can still improve my dorayaki.

2318
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,980
Nice, I acquire more memories.

2319
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:54,420
Oh, I should train.

2320
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:57,520
This exploration...

2321
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,640
Oh, this costs less.

2322
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,680
So yeah, you basically...

2323
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,360
Paste the bread on the book...

2324
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,520
And then you remember stuff.

2325
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,060
Alright, keep doing it.

2326
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,000
He's just...

2327
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,580
He's doing his best.

2328
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,400
Okay guys, he's just...

2329
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,980
He's just existing.

2330
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,000
Oh, did he like my dorayaki?

2331
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,000
By lots of people.

2332
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,620
Some people joined in just to try and win.

2333
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,280
Oh, yay!

2334
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,320
They tried to join the event to win...

2335
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:29,540
An item that's 100 yen.

2336
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,460
That's when you know...

2337
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:34,580
It's good dorayaki.

2338
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,740
Let's go!

2339
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:43,890
It's just 100 yen...

2340
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:44,870
But fuck it.

2341
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:49,250
What did I get?

2342
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:50,610
Oh my god.

2343
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:53,670
30,000 dollars for 100 yen dorayaki?

2344
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:54,830
Let's fucking go.

2345
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:56,310
Oh, I got Bonsai.

2346
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:56,410
Bonsai!

2347
01:38:57,970 --> 01:38:59,570
Can I build anything else?

2348
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:01,530
Oh, I can build a tree.

2349
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:03,130
Just my little fucking shrub.

2350
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:04,990
There you go.

2351
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:07,750
You guys like my shrub?

2352
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:09,170
It's tiny.

2353
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:12,270
Oh, I should put the menu like...

2354
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:13,470
Next to it.

2355
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:16,130
So they know exactly what they're seeing.

2356
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:17,190
Oh wait, it's inside.

2357
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:17,970
Okay, nevermind.

2358
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:18,970
Um...

2359
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:20,450
It still works!

2360
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:22,870
It still sorta works, guys.

2361
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:25,250
Um...

2362
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,830
Did I just unlock this?

2363
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:28,950
I don't remember.

2364
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:31,010
What's an Eve's?

2365
01:39:32,110 --> 01:39:33,830
The fuck is an Eve's?

2366
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:35,530
I don't know.

2367
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,390
Oh wait, that's the third pie.

2368
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:40,230
We don't need pie.

2369
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:41,490
My cool shrub.

2370
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:43,710
Oh my god!

2371
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:44,490
Stonks!

2372
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:47,990
Oh wait, it went down.

2373
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:48,350
What?

2374
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:50,590
How did it go down?

2375
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:52,790
This doesn't make...

2376
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:53,490
What?

2377
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:57,830
How did my stonk go down?

2378
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:00,750
Like...

2379
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:01,250
What?

2380
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:05,890
Not stonks.

2381
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:08,670
This doesn't add up.

2382
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:14,050
I have my...

2383
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:15,070
Takecopter.

2384
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:20,550
Let's have MiniDoraemon join the ingredient search too.

2385
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:26,430
This way, we'll get even more ingredients and items.

2386
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:33,170
You can select whether to take MiniDoraemon along on the screen or choose to go ingredient searching.

2387
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:34,690
Alright, go.

2388
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:38,750
Go and help me find MiniDoraemon.

2389
01:40:39,970 --> 01:40:41,370
Oh my god, I got a vacant lot.

2390
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:42,730
It's time.

2391
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:45,470
I got cherry leaves?

2392
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:47,130
What am I gonna do with cherry leaves?

2393
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:49,410
Oh wait!

2394
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:50,830
New item!

2395
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:54,010
Oh, I can buy Mugworth!

2396
01:40:54,410 --> 01:40:55,530
But like, it doesn't matter.

2397
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:57,150
I don't need Mugworth right now.

2398
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:02,730
I wanted to build a vacant lot.

2399
01:41:04,910 --> 01:41:07,950
So like, my staff members can hang out.

2400
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:11,050
Jesus Christ, it's a huge area.

2401
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,910
Wait, I can't build it?

2402
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:16,890
Oh, I guess I have to build it here.

2403
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:19,990
Why do I need a pathway?

2404
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:22,210
Oh, I need to put grass there.

2405
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:24,730
I was like, am I gonna build inside?

2406
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:30,070
Okay, and then right here.

2407
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:32,390
It's so hard to like...

2408
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:37,130
It's really hard to move around.

2409
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:42,190
Okay, as long as people love my dorayaki, that's all I care about.

2410
01:41:42,190 --> 01:41:46,190
15 families could have lived in that dorayaki.

2411
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:47,610
No!

2412
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:50,750
Who dares interrupt my nap?

2413
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:52,190
I'll make you... Oh my god!

2414
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:53,850
There's the boss fight!

2415
01:41:54,110 --> 01:41:54,990
Oh my god!

2416
01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:57,950
I was like, wondering what the fuck they meant by boss fight.

2417
01:41:59,070 --> 01:42:00,770
Nobita and friends have arrived.

2418
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,690
I have a boss fight?

2419
01:42:04,490 --> 01:42:05,770
What is he doing?

2420
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:08,390
Oh my god, they're beating them up.

2421
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:09,390
Oh my...

2422
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:12,390
Get out of here, cloud boy!

2423
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:15,570
Get out of there, cloud men!

2424
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:18,690
I'm here to urbanize your area.

2425
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:20,950
Holy shit!

2426
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:22,710
Nobita!

2427
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,050
Oh my god, three more!

2428
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:31,270
It's up to you!

2429
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:34,770
Oh my god!

2430
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:35,750
Jihan!

2431
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,030
Jihan, it's only up to you!

2432
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:39,030
Jihan!

2433
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:39,810
Jihan, let's go!

2434
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:43,250
He's protecting his property.

2435
01:42:46,730 --> 01:42:47,470
That's right.

2436
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:49,030
This is Nobita.

2437
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:51,090
This is Doraemon land now.

2438
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:55,210
That's fucking right.

2439
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:58,050
I own this place now.

2440
01:42:58,250 --> 01:42:59,070
He did it.

2441
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:01,230
The bully's done it again.

2442
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:05,830
That's fucking right.

2443
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,430
Do I...

2444
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:08,930
Is this connected?

2445
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,430
I cannot tell if it's connected.

2446
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:14,490
Oh, what book did I get this time?

2447
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:16,310
Is this for real?

2448
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:18,910
I can see something on the other side of the book.

2449
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:21,890
Connect.

2450
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:23,990
I have 35 F points.

2451
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:26,490
Give me more customers.

2452
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:29,970
I'm gonna be a conglomerate.

2453
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:34,110
Is this Japan from a long time ago?

2454
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:38,630
I didn't have to use my rocket to go on an extraordinary adventure.

2455
01:43:43,070 --> 01:43:45,030
A whole city explored.

2456
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:47,290
Thank you for this opportunity.

2457
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:51,310
Okay, I...

2458
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:53,430
I know that...

2459
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:56,070
I know that I'm mochi dough now.

2460
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:59,190
And like, several people wanted something with mochi dough.

2461
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:02,150
Okay, mochi dough, mugworms, and red bean paste.

2462
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:03,390
Oh my god, I can finally make it.

2463
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:06,330
I can actually, finally, fucking make it.

2464
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:08,250
Oh my god, and I got butter!

2465
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:11,190
Everything is moving up in the world.

2466
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:14,150
Okay, it was Mugworth, and...

2467
01:44:14,670 --> 01:44:15,630
Oh, I already forgot.

2468
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:17,670
Guys, what was it?

2469
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:19,450
Guys, what was it?

2470
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:21,470
I remember it was like Mugworth and something.

2471
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:23,990
Guys, what came with Mugworth?

2472
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:28,250
Was it red bean?

2473
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:29,410
It was red bean?

2474
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:29,750
Okay.

2475
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:32,190
Okay.

2476
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,110
Okay.

2477
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:37,770
Make this...

2478
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:38,850
Glaze it up.

2479
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:42,870
Glaze up my mochi!

2480
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:44,630
Nice.

2481
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:45,690
Oh, it looks nice.

2482
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:48,730
Alright, what do you think?

2483
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:50,750
Yeah!

2484
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:54,980
They all see potential.

2485
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,660
They gave me plus one rep.

2486
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:01,260
I'm here from the Dorayaki Promotion Association.

2487
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:23,200
Oh my god, we gotta...

2488
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:27,220
Guys, we have to...

2489
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,260
What was it?

2490
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:29,680
Improve, right?

2491
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:30,500
Wait, what was it?

2492
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:31,140
Helpers.

2493
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,380
Helpers, sweets appraisal.

2494
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:38,440
Seeds with higher charm will make a better impression?

2495
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:40,960
I only have one.

2496
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:42,900
Charm 22?

2497
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,900
Let's wait and see what happens.

2498
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:46,300
Okay.

2499
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,580
Guys, this is good.

2500
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:51,040
We might get a mission and star for this, guys.

2501
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,400
Just give it all to the teacher.

2502
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:58,360
Yeah!

2503
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,420
Now I'm gonna get an A plus for real.

2504
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:05,220
Okay, we gotta...

2505
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,720
Build a mochi shell.

2506
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:08,240
There it is.

2507
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:09,700
I thought that was also mochi.

2508
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:11,760
I guess it's different mochis?

2509
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:13,500
Dad!

2510
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:18,040
Will you finally acknowledge me as your son?

2511
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:22,320
Oh my god, he's...

2512
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:23,700
My dad will...

2513
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:27,000
I won't... I won't have daddy issues anymore.

2514
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:30,960
He finally loves me, guys.

2515
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:36,540
My dad finally loves me.

2516
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,880
He knows I exist.

2517
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,700
Alright, let's see.

2518
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:47,220
I don't have strawberries yet.

2519
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:50,940
I know there is one where I can make.

2520
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:52,640
What is this?

2521
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:54,440
Butter, red bean.

2522
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,600
Okay, butter, red bean.

2523
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:58,100
Let me see real quick.

2524
01:46:59,140 --> 01:46:59,720
Uh...

2525
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:03,020
Make...

2526
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:05,700
Butter...

2527
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,720
Red bean.

2528
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:08,300
Yay!

2529
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:12,940
Increase the taste!

2530
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:14,780
I got my dad's approval, guys.

2531
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:17,820
Maybe he'll finally say I love you and give me a hug.

2532
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,340
After he goes...

2533
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:21,940
After his...

2534
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:26,080
After he's done drinking, of course, because drinking is more important than spending time with his family.

2535
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:32,020
Toki, why would you...

2536
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:35,100
Because that's actually in the story, guys.

2537
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:39,260
I wish I was joking, but he actually...

2538
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:44,280
He goes out to drink instead of spending time with his family no matter what.

2539
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:45,800
It's a problem.

2540
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:48,020
It's a problem.

2541
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:51,400
Yay!

2542
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,540
Now he's gonna visit my store too!

2543
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:58,160
Pricing cat.

2544
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:59,800
Customer satisfaction has activated.

2545
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:00,920
Come here, cat.

2546
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:02,380
It's a shopping fever!

2547
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:06,530
Bye, bye!

2548
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:07,250
Sell, sell!

2549
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:10,070
Oh my god, I get to go to the desert palace.

2550
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:12,210
Alright.

2551
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:13,670
Oh hey, there's a monkey.

2552
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:16,170
Oh no.

2553
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:18,250
A ghost blocks my way.

2554
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:20,030
There's no way.

2555
01:48:20,130 --> 01:48:22,210
I feel like I can beat the ghost.

2556
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:25,430
I can beat him.

2557
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:28,950
Alright, I might need to train my...

2558
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:31,090
I might need to train my helpers, actually.

2559
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:34,750
Let me make sure my helpers survive.

2560
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:37,630
Let me make sure.

2561
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:39,270
I'm a little scared.

2562
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:42,350
Alright, I hope you guys don't have peanut allergies.

2563
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:43,690
Eat the peanut!

2564
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:44,010
Oh my god.

2565
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:49,290
Okay, I gotta make sure my...

2566
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:53,250
We don't know if they have peanut allergies or not, but... Oh, musical performance?

2567
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:57,870
Why would I pay $10 to make sure none of them have it?

2568
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:03,870
Get that protein in!

2569
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:07,130
Get it inside you!

2570
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:10,450
Alright, let's see.

2571
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:11,050
Rank up.

2572
01:49:11,110 --> 01:49:11,950
Oh, I can rank up!

2573
01:49:14,150 --> 01:49:14,630
Yeah!

2574
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:19,270
Hello!

2575
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:23,490
I heard you ranked up, so I rushed over right away with my wiki how page.

2576
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:26,650
It's incredible you got your first star so quickly!

2577
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:28,850
Here's a reward for you!

2578
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:29,390
Enjoy!

2579
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:30,610
Congratulations!

2580
01:49:31,550 --> 01:49:32,230
What did I get?

2581
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:36,150
I got... Oh, I got permissive...

2582
01:49:37,230 --> 01:49:37,710
Persimmons!

2583
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:41,150
And then... Oh, I got like cute decorations!

2584
01:49:43,970 --> 01:49:45,930
I discovered a new story?

2585
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:49,350
Shooting stars.

2586
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:54,470
That store was so busy today.

2587
01:49:54,930 --> 01:49:56,970
It really is hard work.

2588
01:49:57,970 --> 01:49:58,850
Oh, look!

2589
01:49:59,230 --> 01:50:00,770
That's so pretty!

2590
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:03,730
It's a meteor shower!

2591
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:05,430
Doraemon?

2592
01:50:06,370 --> 01:50:11,330
It is hard work helping out a store, but I really enjoy it.

2593
01:50:12,570 --> 01:50:13,210
You do?

2594
01:50:14,370 --> 01:50:14,910
Yeah!

2595
01:50:15,630 --> 01:50:18,670
Making sweets and seeing the customers really love them?

2596
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:20,430
It's so amazing!

2597
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:21,790
Wow!

2598
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:27,430
That's weird you never told your grandson about this, about how you opened a sweet store.

2599
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:32,110
I wonder what happens in the future that made you not talk about it ever again!

2600
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:40,830
lol I wish we had as many customers as there are stars in the sky tonight.

2601
01:50:42,230 --> 01:50:44,030
That might be a tall order.

2602
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:48,810
But I'm sure we'll meet a lot of people at this store.

2603
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:50,110
Oh, foreshadowing!

2604
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:56,050
lol People from all sorts of worlds.

2605
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:58,130
That'd be great!

2606
01:50:59,050 --> 01:50:59,650
Okay.

2607
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:01,310
We better get some sleep.

2608
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:02,450
The rest is up for tomorrow.

2609
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:09,130
I have soursauce!

2610
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:09,890
I can make fun!

2611
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:13,390
Here are the conditions.

2612
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:15,810
Alright, here's page two of the wiki how!

2613
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:18,430
Raise my rep.

2614
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:21,830
Discover new sweets and get the sweet store served.

2615
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:23,850
Okay, so I need...

2616
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:28,290
I need more sweets and then I need to discover more sweets too.

2617
01:51:29,870 --> 01:51:30,390
Alright.

2618
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:36,370
The children gets paid rise to popularity seems unstoppable.

2619
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:41,370
We just received a report of a mysterious new device installed at the store.

2620
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:48,110
The come here cat as it's called activates when customer satisfaction reaches a certain level, triggering a sweets fever.

2621
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:53,070
When that happens, passerby feels irresistibly drawn to come in and buy some sweets.

2622
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:58,430
A customer we interviewed after such a shopping frenzy told us I had something else today.

2623
01:51:58,910 --> 01:51:59,950
Isn't this illegal?

2624
01:52:00,510 --> 01:52:02,030
I feel like...

2625
01:52:02,030 --> 01:52:03,270
Isn't what we're doing illegal?

2626
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:07,930
Like...

2627
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:08,650
I don't know.

2628
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:10,170
It doesn't feel like natural.

2629
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:15,050
Yeah, it feels a little bit suspicious here.

2630
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:19,790
But we're not being investigated so...

2631
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:28,250
I had some guys are like, Toki, you literally read somebody's mind to figure out what their dorayaki sweets is and it was definitely not consensual.

2632
01:52:31,770 --> 01:52:33,610
Let's do more illegal things!

2633
01:52:34,470 --> 01:52:35,050
Let's...

2634
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:36,070
Let's go!

2635
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:40,910
Oh my god, slightly reduces hospitality cost.

2636
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:41,850
Oh my god.

2637
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:42,510
Okay, wait.

2638
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:43,110
What's this?

2639
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:45,510
Score better in tasting events.

2640
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:49,970
Enables you to build the indoor fishing pond.

2641
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:53,210
Enables you to build a dream freely.

2642
01:52:53,410 --> 01:52:56,350
Okay, we need this because the tasting guy is coming over.

2643
01:52:59,350 --> 01:53:04,930
Alright, we have to get this in so like when the guy comes over to taste...

2644
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:08,850
Okay, how do I activate the tool though?

2645
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:10,830
Items.

2646
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:13,770
Wait, perma set?

2647
01:53:15,490 --> 01:53:17,050
Don't I have perma in there?

2648
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:20,850
Oh, he's not in here yet.

2649
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:22,750
Wait, how do I activate it?

2650
01:53:24,690 --> 01:53:26,750
How do I activate the...

2651
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:31,610
How do I activate it?

2652
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:32,530
I don't know!

2653
01:53:35,010 --> 01:53:35,770
Oh no.

2654
01:53:36,670 --> 01:53:38,630
I don't know how to activate my...

2655
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:40,930
Oh, maybe he like comes over.

2656
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:42,830
Oh, it's a passive.

2657
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:43,270
Yeah, yeah.

2658
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:45,090
I was like thinking it might be a passive then.

2659
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:47,510
I think it has to be a passive.

2660
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:49,830
Oh, let me put a tree in here.

2661
01:53:50,670 --> 01:53:51,510
Alright, nice.

2662
01:53:51,610 --> 01:53:52,190
Plus one.

2663
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:54,730
What's the new quest?

2664
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:56,290
Oh, I got a new story!

2665
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:00,190
Oh, it's my future wife again!

2666
01:54:01,330 --> 01:54:02,910
You've got a lot more customers now.

2667
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:03,690
Isn't it great?

2668
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:06,270
Yes, but we can still deal with a lot more.

2669
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:11,090
But, how do we go about tracking more customers?

2670
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:14,250
Hmm, let me think.

2671
01:54:15,270 --> 01:54:17,190
You know who likes sweets besides...

2672
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:18,190
Ants!

2673
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:19,210
Oh, alright.

2674
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:20,650
He's cooking enough.

2675
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:22,250
No more cooking.

2676
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:25,890
Actually...

2677
01:54:25,890 --> 01:54:28,370
Wow, the world is full of humans too!

2678
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:31,830
Let's invite customers from afar to come and visit us!

2679
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:33,970
That's a great idea.

2680
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:39,190
How can we make it easier for customers from afar to visit us?

2681
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:45,230
Well, how about... Are we really running a shuttle bus for a fucking dorayaki store?

2682
01:54:45,230 --> 01:54:47,210
Like, we're like...

2683
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:49,230
Hello people visiting Japan!

2684
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:56,170
Let me take you to this really tiny dorayaki store run by children!

2685
01:54:57,170 --> 01:55:03,250
Now, I know in the west that child labor is very frowned upon.

2686
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:04,610
But you're in Japan!

2687
01:55:05,370 --> 01:55:09,030
And in a specific place in Japan where like...

2688
01:55:09,030 --> 01:55:10,030
Do not worry!

2689
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:11,830
It's legal!

2690
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:16,130
This will become the terrorist spot!

2691
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:21,550
Okay!

2692
01:55:21,910 --> 01:55:22,690
That's it!

2693
01:55:22,770 --> 01:55:23,810
Let's do it!

2694
01:55:25,870 --> 01:55:28,530
I can't wait to see who comes to our store!

2695
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:30,070
And I hope they'll love it!

2696
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,440
Alright.

2697
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,620
Oh no, I see the ghost.

2698
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:41,000
I see the ghost.

2699
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:44,940
I see the ghost at the bottom.

2700
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:45,660
He's ready.

2701
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,080
He's ready to fucking fight me.

2702
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:49,520
Do I have matcha yet?

2703
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:50,880
No, I haven't discovered matcha.

2704
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,660
There's like one I can make.

2705
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:53,960
I'm trying to...

2706
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:55,460
Okay, I can't make this yet.

2707
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:56,560
Can I make this yet?

2708
01:55:56,740 --> 01:55:57,680
Okay, I don't have soybean.

2709
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:01,120
Alright, let's get the...

2710
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,800
And then get the glass partition for it.

2711
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:05,460
Oh, there he is!

2712
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:07,660
It's time to fight!

2713
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:12,580
This is my turf and you're not welcome.

2714
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,600
You made a big mistake coming this way.

2715
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:18,160
Alright everybody, it's time to fight.

2716
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:23,580
I know you live here.

2717
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:27,380
But like, this is my house.

2718
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:28,700
This is my home now.

2719
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:34,280
The opponent did something mean.

2720
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:40,840
That's right, I'm gonna beat you up and take your lunch.

2721
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:44,400
But oh my god, Nobita, are you fucking kidding me?

2722
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:51,240
Oh no, Jian.

2723
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:53,100
Jian, yes!

2724
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:54,600
Jian the bully!

2725
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,340
Don't eat my mouth.

2726
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:01,920
Alright, uh...

2727
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,720
I think I can build more, right?

2728
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:06,720
Okay, I got this.

2729
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:10,640
Uh, I'll build... No, I don't wanna build this yet.

2730
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:13,940
Uh, oh, I can train more.

2731
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:16,140
Okay, let's eat more peanuts I guess.

2732
01:57:17,020 --> 01:57:19,600
Oh my god, eating peanuts costs 10 now.

2733
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:21,080
That sucks.

2734
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,460
Or like, costs 16.

2735
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:25,300
It gets more expensive the more I use it, I noticed.

2736
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:27,760
Holding memory...

2737
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:29,740
Okay, Nobita, like...

2738
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:31,960
What is your purpose, Nobita?

2739
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:33,080
What...

2740
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:35,820
What is your purpose anymore?

2741
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:37,980
What do you do?

2742
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:55,270
Hello everybody!

2743
01:57:56,110 --> 01:57:57,830
We're gonna go camping!

2744
01:58:00,770 --> 01:58:02,010
Yeah!

2745
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:08,930
Nice.

2746
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:10,650
Okay, they all loved it.

2747
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:14,170
Because if they didn't, I would've left them stranded in the woods.

2748
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:16,230
So I'm glad they all loved it.

2749
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:18,550
It was a lovely picnic!

2750
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:20,790
I had so much fun with everyone!

2751
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:22,070
Let's do this again sometime!

2752
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:26,050
Everyone had a good time, I'm so glad we did this!

2753
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:27,930
Oh, another big book.

2754
01:58:28,050 --> 01:58:29,210
Oh, which world is this?

2755
01:58:30,350 --> 01:58:31,470
Is this for real?

2756
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:33,790
I can see something on the other side of the book.

2757
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:34,590
Yes!

2758
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:35,470
No!

2759
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:37,310
My F points!

2760
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:40,630
No!

2761
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:43,690
I don't have enough.

2762
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:45,590
I don't have enough F points.

2763
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,890
I actually don't have enough.

2764
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:49,790
How is this possible?

2765
01:58:51,570 --> 01:58:53,170
Okay, I'm gonna charm...

2766
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:54,770
I'm gonna charm up my seats.

2767
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:56,510
Nice.

2768
01:58:57,870 --> 01:58:59,430
Okay, now I'll charm this up too.

2769
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:01,110
My F points.

2770
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:04,610
First it was my rank words, now it's my F points.

2771
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:08,310
Wait, do I have new gadgets?

2772
01:59:08,630 --> 01:59:09,290
No, I don't.

2773
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:10,950
Can I buy new stuff?

2774
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:11,850
Oh wait, I can!

2775
01:59:12,310 --> 01:59:13,610
I really wanna save up.

2776
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:16,250
I wanna get the treasure finder.

2777
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:20,710
When is the critic gonna come?

2778
01:59:21,930 --> 01:59:23,030
Oh, I got matcha!

2779
01:59:23,150 --> 01:59:23,470
Yay!

2780
01:59:27,450 --> 01:59:28,850
I actually got matcha.

2781
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:31,550
Okay, I can't improve anything.

2782
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:34,970
We don't find anyone to judge at the painting competition.

2783
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:35,990
It will get cancelled.

2784
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:36,830
Please help.

2785
01:59:38,110 --> 01:59:40,030
Someone help me!

2786
01:59:43,290 --> 01:59:44,050
Oh wait!

2787
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:45,190
My mom!

2788
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:47,210
Don't worry, guys.

2789
01:59:47,790 --> 01:59:50,270
My mom will judge your painting competition.

2790
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:53,450
She has no other... She has no painting skills.

2791
01:59:53,830 --> 01:59:54,950
But that's okay.

2792
01:59:58,130 --> 02:00:00,930
Oh wait, I ran out of seats.

2793
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:03,830
I should build more seats, though.

2794
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:04,850
Honestly.

2795
02:00:08,730 --> 02:00:09,950
Put it here.

2796
02:00:10,990 --> 02:00:12,550
And then... Oh my god!

2797
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:13,990
It's time to expand!

2798
02:00:14,150 --> 02:00:15,130
Oh, goodbye neighborhood!

2799
02:00:17,430 --> 02:00:19,110
I'm sorry, every time...

2800
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:22,630
Every time I like...

2801
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:25,270
Goodbye neighborhood, it's my neighborhood now.

2802
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:29,930
We don't know what happened to those people.

2803
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:32,930
Oh, I got shuttle bus!

2804
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:35,090
And I got glass partition.

2805
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:39,250
What happened to them?

2806
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:40,130
We'll never know.

2807
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:42,830
We'll never know what happened to them.

2808
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:46,770
Oh, uh...

2809
02:00:46,770 --> 02:00:49,490
I still want... Wait, do I have any of them that's stronger?

2810
02:00:52,230 --> 02:00:53,770
No, nobita is the strongest.

2811
02:00:54,270 --> 02:00:56,390
Oh, okay, so now I finished everybody.

2812
02:00:57,070 --> 02:00:59,210
Let's go to the hill behind the school.

2813
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:01,590
Alright!

2814
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:02,730
Yay!

2815
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:07,210
Uh...

2816
02:01:07,210 --> 02:01:08,750
Items... Oh, I get marble.

2817
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:10,590
Mom, take my marble!

2818
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:12,750
Oh my god, look!

2819
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:13,250
Look!

2820
02:01:13,530 --> 02:01:14,650
People from other side!

2821
02:01:14,930 --> 02:01:17,190
Hello, this is a new hit tourist destination!

2822
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:19,070
Hello, everybody!

2823
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:25,680
My new...

2824
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:29,100
My most hit craze tourist destination right here!

2825
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:31,260
Wait, can I rank up?

2826
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:35,500
Uh...

2827
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:41,520
Make... I can make two, but like, I don't know the recipe for it.

2828
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:44,960
I'm too worried to experiment on recipes.

2829
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:49,220
I'm pretty sure...

2830
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:51,560
I don't have enough.

2831
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:53,240
Let me check.

2832
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,000
Double check.

2833
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:56,980
Oh, I do have matcha!

2834
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:58,240
Okay, matcha red bean.

2835
02:01:58,620 --> 02:01:59,900
Okay, I can make that.

2836
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:02,200
Uh...

2837
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,160
Matcha red bean.

2838
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:06,900
Yay!

2839
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:08,580
Matcha teriyaki!

2840
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:13,380
I don't know.

2841
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:14,360
Make it taste better!

2842
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:19,520
Put your magic... Put your magic juice in there.

2843
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:21,700
Alright, tasting event!

2844
02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:27,890
Oh, it's my new record!

2845
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:29,290
Oh, plus three!

2846
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:31,750
Alright, monkey.

2847
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:35,490
Here's your matcha teriyaki.

2848
02:02:37,870 --> 02:02:38,130
Yay!

2849
02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:42,270
I got matcha teriyaki!

2850
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:45,390
Wait, what does Qian want?

2851
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:47,910
Qian, what do you want?

2852
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:50,610
Doraemon!

2853
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:52,390
Can I talk to you for a minute?

2854
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:56,010
Sure, what is it?

2855
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:59,410
So my mom's story's doing really well.

2856
02:02:59,970 --> 02:03:01,830
And she's been in a great mood lately.

2857
02:03:02,610 --> 02:03:03,350
That's great!

2858
02:03:04,350 --> 02:03:05,750
Yeah, but here's the thing.

2859
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:09,550
I scored zero points on the last test.

2860
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:15,390
I will tell mom at some point, but I'd like to get her in an even better mood.

2861
02:03:16,190 --> 02:03:18,550
Okay, and how are you planning on to do that?

2862
02:03:19,610 --> 02:03:21,810
By increasing sales at all.

2863
02:03:23,370 --> 02:03:25,750
Um, what do you mean by that, Qian?

2864
02:03:26,890 --> 02:03:28,090
Yeah, that might work.

2865
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:29,590
Right?

2866
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:30,930
Okay, then.

2867
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:32,590
I'll leave it to you, Doraemon.

2868
02:03:33,250 --> 02:03:33,710
What?

2869
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:36,570
He's bad in the product launch.

2870
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:37,930
It boosts sales, I think.

2871
02:03:39,110 --> 02:03:39,830
I know.

2872
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:41,170
I'll try my best.

2873
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:44,110
I'm too soft-hearted.

2874
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:49,950
You see, if I don't do that, he's gonna beat me up.

2875
02:03:49,950 --> 02:03:52,070
And I really don't want him to beat me up, guys.

2876
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:53,290
Like...

2877
02:03:53,770 --> 02:03:56,870
I feel like that's understandable, right, guys?

2878
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:59,250
I really don't want him to beat me up.

2879
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:01,650
How do I...

2880
02:04:01,650 --> 02:04:03,670
Oh, I guess I find more ingredients.

2881
02:04:04,450 --> 02:04:08,730
I have to find more ingredients to be able to beat him up.

2882
02:04:10,270 --> 02:04:12,990
Or not be able to, like, satisfy him.

2883
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:15,810
Wait, what was the one...

2884
02:04:15,810 --> 02:04:17,590
I had a new character that asked to...

2885
02:04:17,590 --> 02:04:18,750
Oh, it's the strawberry.

2886
02:04:19,230 --> 02:04:21,650
I just don't know where to find strawberries.

2887
02:04:22,650 --> 02:04:27,250
I have to pay him to increase his store?!

2888
02:04:28,950 --> 02:04:29,490
Okay.

2889
02:04:31,530 --> 02:04:32,070
Okay.

2890
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:34,290
Okay.

2891
02:04:34,290 --> 02:04:35,330
That's crazy.

2892
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:39,470
I have to pay him to, like, fix his store.

2893
02:04:42,110 --> 02:04:43,730
I don't have strawberries.

2894
02:04:44,930 --> 02:04:48,310
It says I can make new items, but I don't know what the recipe is for it.

2895
02:04:48,730 --> 02:04:50,770
Just a small loan of $10,000?

2896
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:52,830
What could go wrong?

2897
02:04:54,110 --> 02:04:54,750
Honestly.

2898
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:56,870
What could go wrong?

2899
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,910
Um...

2900
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:03,250
28 F points.

2901
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:07,090
I feel like I already increased the F points.

2902
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:08,870
Plus 3.

2903
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:11,850
And then, I'll do seeding as well.

2904
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:14,610
That's just extortion.

2905
02:05:15,010 --> 02:05:17,470
I pay him and he's extorting me.

2906
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:23,170
I just need...

2907
02:05:23,890 --> 02:05:27,890
When is my thing gonna get...

2908
02:05:30,250 --> 02:05:31,070
When...

2909
02:05:31,930 --> 02:05:33,950
When is the critic coming?

2910
02:05:35,830 --> 02:05:39,230
I thought...

2911
02:05:39,230 --> 02:05:40,000
They're not...

2912
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:41,510
Oh!

2913
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:46,920
They're not...

2914
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:49,980
Oh, he's already...

2915
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:50,920
When is he gonna...

2916
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:55,180
I just want my certification.

2917
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:56,340
When is he... Oh, okay.

2918
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:59,740
Do you know anyone with great sales who could help?

2919
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:03,420
He didn't give me a certificate.

2920
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:06,760
Don't worry.

2921
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:07,700
I got my smart boy.

2922
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:10,360
My smart boy is here.

2923
02:06:12,140 --> 02:06:13,150
Why didn't he...

2924
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:15,460
Why didn't he give me my certificate?

2925
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:19,140
I demand my certificate.

2926
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:22,520
I'm gonna put this here.

2927
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:25,240
And...

2928
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:26,300
The...

2929
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:27,600
Did he not like it enough?

2930
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:29,360
I don't understand.

2931
02:06:30,580 --> 02:06:32,220
I thought he liked it.

2932
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:36,580
Did he not like my...

2933
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:37,580
My dorayaki?

2934
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,040
Where's my...

2935
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:41,520
Where's my certificate?

2936
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:42,000
Certificate!

2937
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:47,040
Go!

2938
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:50,960
I need another event to happen?

2939
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:51,880
Oh my god.

2940
02:06:51,940 --> 02:06:52,980
How many events do I need?

2941
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:56,880
How many events do I need?

2942
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:00,720
Let's see.

2943
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:02,100
Okay, I need more money.

2944
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:04,520
I need more future coins.

2945
02:07:06,020 --> 02:07:06,290
And...

2946
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:07,900
Can I afford it yet?

2947
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:10,640
Wait, when the fuck did I spend my future coins?

2948
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:17,350
Did I get like...

2949
02:07:19,490 --> 02:07:21,310
Who stole my coins?

2950
02:07:22,130 --> 02:07:24,290
Who the fuck stole my coins?

2951
02:07:27,470 --> 02:07:28,150
I...

2952
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:30,690
I had future coins.

2953
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:31,750
What happened to them?

2954
02:07:35,330 --> 02:07:37,310
Wait, it is a dino egg!

2955
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:42,610
Oh my god, that's a dinosaur egg!

2956
02:07:45,630 --> 02:07:46,990
Okay, uh...

2957
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:49,390
I got glasses.

2958
02:07:49,670 --> 02:07:52,390
I'm gonna give it to my mom, cause she always needs glasses.

2959
02:07:53,310 --> 02:07:54,030
And then...

2960
02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:56,330
I'll give it to...

2961
02:07:57,450 --> 02:07:58,690
I'll give it to him.

2962
02:07:59,150 --> 02:07:59,750
He's smart.

2963
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:04,800
Oh my god, there we go.

2964
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:06,220
I invested in dinosaur eggs.

2965
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:08,320
Mom has returned!

2966
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:10,400
How did it turn out, mom?

2967
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:14,760
Unleashed her inner art creator and did an amazing job at the... Yay!

2968
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:17,880
25 rank points!

2969
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:19,240
I mean, F points!

2970
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:23,880
Okay, we need more...

2971
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:24,880
F points.

2972
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:25,880
We're like...

2973
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:28,740
We're so low on F points right now.

2974
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:33,340
Okay, now that we have F points, we should be able to connect to this world.

2975
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:43,940
I've connected to the Esper Mommy!

2976
02:08:45,180 --> 02:08:49,060
Have my psychic powers grown so much that I can travel between worlds?

2977
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:52,620
Since I'm here, I'll have some fun!

2978
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:53,600
Wait, that's it?

2979
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:55,200
That's all he's gonna say?

2980
02:08:56,100 --> 02:08:57,400
Oh, potential new customer.

2981
02:08:57,820 --> 02:08:59,140
What do you want, customer?

2982
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,000
Can I make it... Okay, whipped cream...

2983
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:05,980
Red bean paste.

2984
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:06,760
Whipped cream...

2985
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:07,600
Red bean paste.

2986
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:09,800
Whipped...

2987
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:13,420
Whipped cream... Did my cells go up?

2988
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:17,240
Oh my god!

2989
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:18,680
That's right!

2990
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:19,380
Stonks!

2991
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:20,960
Stonks right...

2992
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,400
Oh my god!

2993
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:25,040
44,000!

2994
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:27,140
That's fucking right, guys!

2995
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:29,540
That's all I needed!

2996
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:32,640
Never sell!

2997
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:33,940
Hahaha!

2998
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:37,440
Never sell!

2999
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:38,660
Always believe!

3000
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:43,400
Okay, it was...

3001
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:45,020
Oh my god, what did she want again?

3002
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:48,900
Yeah, hold it!

3003
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:51,100
To the moon we go!

3004
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:53,060
I think it was like...

3005
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:54,840
What is it?

3006
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:56,540
Daifuku dough...

3007
02:09:56,540 --> 02:09:58,920
Whipped cream, red bean paste, dough...

3008
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:00,900
Whipped cream, red bean paste, dough...

3009
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:04,880
Dough...

3010
02:10:09,570 --> 02:10:10,710
What is it again?

3011
02:10:11,390 --> 02:10:12,270
Oh, whipped cream!

3012
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:14,650
I don't have whipped cream!

3013
02:10:17,550 --> 02:10:18,330
Okay, okay.

3014
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:19,450
I need to buy whipped cream.

3015
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:22,370
Uh...

3016
02:10:22,370 --> 02:10:23,810
Oh my god, I almost bought this.

3017
02:10:24,210 --> 02:10:25,950
Okay, I need to buy whipped cream.

3018
02:10:26,450 --> 02:10:27,450
And then...

3019
02:10:28,010 --> 02:10:29,310
It's okay, I can make it.

3020
02:10:32,670 --> 02:10:33,310
Uh...

3021
02:10:35,910 --> 02:10:37,190
Whipped cream...

3022
02:10:37,190 --> 02:10:39,930
Red bean paste...

3023
02:10:39,930 --> 02:10:40,250
Yeah!

3024
02:10:44,150 --> 02:10:46,470
Get the popularity up!

3025
02:10:48,750 --> 02:10:49,390
Nice!

3026
02:10:49,390 --> 02:10:50,170
Nice!

3027
02:10:51,170 --> 02:10:53,230
Okay, hold the tasting event.

3028
02:10:54,290 --> 02:10:55,650
Plus three...

3029
02:10:55,650 --> 02:10:56,670
Plus three...

3030
02:10:56,670 --> 02:10:57,270
Plus three!

3031
02:10:58,570 --> 02:10:59,830
Are you happy?

3032
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:02,710
Are you happy about my store?

3033
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:05,310
Hey guys, thank you for the super chat!

3034
02:11:05,410 --> 02:11:06,250
Thank you!

3035
02:11:06,370 --> 02:11:07,490
Doki, we get it.

3036
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:09,630
You miss Marvel arrivals.

3037
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:12,250
Nice.

3038
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:14,490
Oh my god, handsome...

3039
02:11:14,490 --> 02:11:15,370
Handsome Doraemon.

3040
02:11:16,210 --> 02:11:17,850
Oh, I have all of them!

3041
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:22,550
Oh my god, I got all three.

3042
02:11:23,090 --> 02:11:23,490
Granny?

3043
02:11:26,650 --> 02:11:28,970
What do you want, Granny?

3044
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:35,730
I'd like to promote one of the children as something to have on the go, but which one?

3045
02:11:38,250 --> 02:11:38,730
Um...

3046
02:11:40,930 --> 02:11:42,110
I'm gonna do this.

3047
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:45,150
Because it has more stats.

3048
02:11:48,070 --> 02:11:50,150
Always pick the one that has more stats.

3049
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:55,270
I think that's all I can improve.

3050
02:11:55,450 --> 02:11:56,750
I want my certificate!

3051
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:14,630
Okay, so I just need him.

3052
02:12:15,270 --> 02:12:17,910
Guys, why don't I have my certificate?

3053
02:12:20,190 --> 02:12:21,670
How do I...

3054
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:22,930
How do they...

3055
02:12:22,930 --> 02:12:24,950
Why don't they like my...

3056
02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:27,470
Why don't you like my food, sir?

3057
02:12:28,530 --> 02:12:29,110
Sir!

3058
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:32,570
Please!

3059
02:12:33,390 --> 02:12:35,190
Like my food!

3060
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:37,710
Why am I not certified?

3061
02:12:37,710 --> 02:12:38,670
Why am I not certified?

3062
02:12:40,650 --> 02:12:42,650
What do I do?

3063
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:49,240
Why doesn't he love my food?

3064
02:12:51,220 --> 02:12:53,240
I don't understand!

3065
02:12:56,140 --> 02:12:58,040
Alright, we don't have to explore anymore.

3066
02:12:59,000 --> 02:12:59,480
Oh!

3067
02:12:59,640 --> 02:12:59,940
Oh!

3068
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:01,180
He's here for the appraisal!

3069
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:03,260
Oh my god, he's finally here!

3070
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:05,240
Oh god, this is it.

3071
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:06,320
This is it.

3072
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:08,780
Oh my god, he bought my dorayaki.

3073
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:09,700
Oh!

3074
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:11,040
He bought it!

3075
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:11,980
This is it.

3076
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:12,820
I'm zooming in.

3077
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:13,900
I need to know.

3078
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:17,020
I'm zooming in.

3079
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:18,740
There it is.

3080
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:20,100
Okay, granny.

3081
02:13:20,280 --> 02:13:21,940
I don't care about what you say.

3082
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,160
I was attended by...

3083
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:27,520
It seems that Wawa has become a trend.

3084
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:28,000
Yay!

3085
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:32,180
It's not premium...

3086
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:33,980
Oh my god, supply and demand.

3087
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,880
And I got $40,000.

3088
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:39,900
Oh my god, what does he think?

3089
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:41,380
I saw his announcement.

3090
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:44,500
10 out of 10.

3091
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:45,460
10 out of 10.

3092
02:13:45,620 --> 02:13:47,400
30, 20, 20.

3093
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:49,040
It's a perfect score!

3094
02:13:54,070 --> 02:13:55,370
We did it.

3095
02:13:56,690 --> 02:13:59,910
I have finally become certified.

3096
02:14:02,220 --> 02:14:03,250
We did it.

3097
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:06,350
Who would you give it to?

3098
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:10,130
Oh, that's difficult.

3099
02:14:10,930 --> 02:14:12,470
Maybe I should just give it to Chen.

3100
02:14:17,170 --> 02:14:19,110
He just gets everything.

3101
02:14:24,930 --> 02:14:26,870
Oh my god, who would I give it to?

3102
02:14:28,710 --> 02:14:29,730
I don't know.

3103
02:14:32,030 --> 02:14:34,810
I mean, he gets more energy if I give it to...

3104
02:14:34,810 --> 02:14:35,750
I'll give it to Raimon.

3105
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:37,210
It was his cooking, you know?

3106
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:40,530
It was his cooking that did it.

3107
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:45,070
We didn't expect too much...

3108
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:47,190
Since you've only just opened...

3109
02:14:47,190 --> 02:14:48,970
And it's also run by children, too.

3110
02:14:49,230 --> 02:14:52,090
To be fair, I feel like you shouldn't expect much...

3111
02:14:52,090 --> 02:14:54,590
Just because it's run by children.

3112
02:14:55,430 --> 02:14:56,810
Keep making wonderful treats...

3113
02:14:57,650 --> 02:14:58,550
The children gets paid.

3114
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:01,250
I can't wait to see what other delights you'll create.

3115
02:15:02,050 --> 02:15:02,510
Yay!

3116
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:03,730
20 future coins.

3117
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:07,470
Nice.

3118
02:15:09,290 --> 02:15:11,430
Oh, I get to improve my Mochi!

3119
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:15,870
Oh my god, we've finally been certified.

3120
02:15:19,050 --> 02:15:20,650
How did that turn out?

3121
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:24,070
The product sold out almost in an instant...

3122
02:15:24,070 --> 02:15:26,110
And the store was swamped with orders for more!

3123
02:15:28,890 --> 02:15:30,210
F points.

3124
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:31,950
Always go for F points.

3125
02:15:32,510 --> 02:15:34,350
I don't need future coins.

3126
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:36,270
I need more F points.

3127
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:41,340
Okay, I can rank up now!

3128
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:44,400
Yay!

3129
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:46,220
I'm two Michelin stars!

3130
02:15:49,820 --> 02:15:50,480
Professionals.

3131
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:53,180
Professional took 20 years to get it.

3132
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,380
It only took me four months.

3133
02:15:57,410 --> 02:15:57,740
Wow!

3134
02:15:57,740 --> 02:16:01,980
Of course, I prepared an award for you this time to congratulate you.

3135
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:05,060
I have a boulder and a lamp.

3136
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:06,940
I feel like...

3137
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:09,900
I feel like my sister...

3138
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:12,040
Literally is like...

3139
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:14,100
Giving away junk from her garage.

3140
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:17,300
She gave me a fucking rock and a light.

3141
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:18,020
A lamp.

3142
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:20,120
Like, I...

3143
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:20,840
I literally...

3144
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:23,720
I got a perfect score and she gave me a fucking rock.

3145
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:25,900
Hey, I've been thinking...

3146
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:28,640
How do your sweets compare to other stores?

3147
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:30,500
I don't know.

3148
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:32,800
Never thought about that.

3149
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:35,680
If our customers like them...

3150
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:36,780
Isn't that all that matters?

3151
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:38,240
No, Pita.

3152
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:39,420
You're so naive.

3153
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:42,700
There are tons of dorayaki stores out there.

3154
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:47,140
If someone else starts selling better sweets than ours...

3155
02:16:47,140 --> 02:16:48,140
We'll lose our customers!

3156
02:16:49,240 --> 02:16:50,580
Oh no, that would be awful!

3157
02:16:51,740 --> 02:16:55,260
We need to have some sort of an idea about how to compare our rivals!

3158
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:59,220
But everyone's personal preferences are different.

3159
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:02,220
We gotta have a monopoly!

3160
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:04,660
We gotta destroy the com...

3161
02:17:04,660 --> 02:17:06,940
We gotta start competitive pricing again.

3162
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:10,040
A sure way to tell our products are good...

3163
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:11,040
Would be entering a contest.

3164
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:15,300
A contest you have professional judges assess the sweets.

3165
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:17,980
Oh, that might be a good idea.

3166
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:19,900
Let's try entering a contest.

3167
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:25,240
If we win and we get the dorayaki association stamp approval...

3168
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:27,120
It's gonna do wonders for our rep!

3169
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:30,920
But not winning doesn't mean our sweets are not good at all.

3170
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:32,360
So let's try to win.

3171
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:35,400
But remember, it's not the end of the world if we don't.

3172
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:36,320
Of course!

3173
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:38,100
No, if it doesn't win...

3174
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:41,380
That means our sweets are dog shit!

3175
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:44,520
And then we should give up and sell our business.

3176
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:47,820
Oh, I get to go to the Misty Forest.

3177
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:50,160
Let's send a child to the Misty Forest.

3178
02:17:52,220 --> 02:17:53,700
Raise my rep.

3179
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,840
Get a Fujiko character.

3180
02:17:56,620 --> 02:17:57,860
Win a contest.

3181
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:00,040
Oh, hey!

3182
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:00,980
They have new products!

3183
02:18:04,340 --> 02:18:05,160
Um...

3184
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:07,780
How do I enter a contest though?

3185
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:11,060
Oh, there he is!

3186
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:14,180
Let's do it.

3187
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:18,280
Uh...

3188
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:20,400
Alright.

3189
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:22,100
Oh my god, so many decorations.

3190
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:24,820
Oh my god, I'm gonna bougie this shit up.

3191
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:26,560
Alright, 8,000.

3192
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:29,360
That's right.

3193
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:30,880
We're gonna put that in here.

3194
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:32,760
And then we're gonna...

3195
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:34,160
I told you the F points.

3196
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:37,880
I told you the F points is gonna matter.

3197
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:38,620
Alright, there we go.

3198
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:40,680
And then, uh...

3199
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:41,760
5,000.

3200
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:42,800
That's right.

3201
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:44,020
Bam!

3202
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:45,800
Um...

3203
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:47,640
E, D, E, D.

3204
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:48,520
Alright, we're ready.

3205
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:51,520
Maybe we should change the dorayaki though.

3206
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:52,060
Maybe.

3207
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:56,120
What is my best dorayaki?

3208
02:18:57,140 --> 02:18:58,380
49, 19.

3209
02:19:00,460 --> 02:19:02,340
Bean paste, 34.

3210
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:05,000
49, 60.

3211
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:05,720
Oh my god.

3212
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:08,040
I think my chestnut one is my highest rated.

3213
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:11,780
Yeah, it's the chestnut.

3214
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:13,700
Alright.

3215
02:19:16,220 --> 02:19:17,680
Who is it going to?

3216
02:19:19,780 --> 02:19:20,360
Doraemon.

3217
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:22,740
Alright, let's go.

3218
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:30,240
Today, confectioners from all over Japan compete for the best quality sweets.

3219
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:31,680
I'm excited.

3220
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:33,120
If we...

3221
02:19:33,780 --> 02:19:36,860
If we lose, I'm ending my career.

3222
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:38,780
To me too.

3223
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:40,400
Looks like the con is about to start.

3224
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:42,540
Alright, let's go and watch the judging.

3225
02:19:46,230 --> 02:19:47,030
Wonderful!

3226
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:48,390
Oh!

3227
02:19:50,090 --> 02:19:50,890
Delicious!

3228
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:55,390
Okay, we literally got 100 from all.

3229
02:19:55,870 --> 02:19:57,190
Like, there's no way.

3230
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,330
Yeah!

3231
02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:02,590
Which career?

3232
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:05,490
We did it!

3233
02:20:06,750 --> 02:20:10,170
Fucking easiest contest of my life.

3234
02:20:12,430 --> 02:20:14,970
Depends on where the dorayaki stops.

3235
02:20:15,230 --> 02:20:17,330
Holy shit, 200,000.

3236
02:20:17,830 --> 02:20:18,170
Okay.

3237
02:20:18,830 --> 02:20:21,910
I don't feel like I need more money.

3238
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:23,970
I feel like we just need points.

3239
02:20:26,850 --> 02:20:27,530
Oh.

3240
02:20:32,610 --> 02:20:33,970
Oh, fuck.

3241
02:20:34,830 --> 02:20:36,070
Oh, maybe 100,000.

3242
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:36,850
That's fine.

3243
02:20:38,150 --> 02:20:38,530
Yeah!

3244
02:20:38,530 --> 02:20:39,230
Yeah!

3245
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:45,080
Okay, 100,000.

3246
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:46,020
Oh my God.

3247
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:47,620
Goodbye, other city.

3248
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:54,920
And they're gone.

3249
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:02,600
All for the sake of desert.

3250
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:05,200
Not my home.

3251
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:05,320
Not my home.

3252
02:21:07,480 --> 02:21:10,340
Guys, you don't understand.

3253
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:13,160
You don't understand.

3254
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:14,580
This is important.

3255
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:16,400
This is for...

3256
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:17,940
Oh wait, I can enter this.

3257
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:20,980
Alright, if we don't win this...

3258
02:21:20,980 --> 02:21:22,400
If we don't win...

3259
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:24,360
Wait, actually, can I improve my daifuku?

3260
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:27,200
I've never improved my daifuku, but...

3261
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:30,100
If we don't win this, I'm actually ending my career.

3262
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:34,120
Okay, change presentation.

3263
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:36,600
Use that.

3264
02:21:38,480 --> 02:21:40,300
And then we'll put that on.

3265
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:42,660
And then...

3266
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:44,060
We'll put that.

3267
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:45,940
And then we'll also...

3268
02:21:45,940 --> 02:21:47,460
We'll put all of this in.

3269
02:21:47,860 --> 02:21:49,640
If it tastes like shit, at least let it.

3270
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:50,740
Alright.

3271
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:52,100
We're ready.

3272
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:55,000
Doraemon.

3273
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:56,540
You get to have it again.

3274
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:58,240
I'm just gonna buff Doraemon.

3275
02:21:58,240 --> 02:21:58,440
Oh no.

3276
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:01,960
Alright, let's see how it goes.

3277
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:04,860
Fantastic.

3278
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:06,220
The best.

3279
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:07,520
Wonderful.

3280
02:22:08,080 --> 02:22:08,980
The best!

3281
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:10,660
That's fucking right.

3282
02:22:16,410 --> 02:22:16,970
Yeah!

3283
02:22:18,610 --> 02:22:21,130
You might as well close down your store.

3284
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:24,770
What do I get from here?

3285
02:22:25,710 --> 02:22:27,250
Oh, this one should be easy.

3286
02:22:34,910 --> 02:22:36,330
Stop giving me money.

3287
02:22:37,850 --> 02:22:41,010
I don't need more money.

3288
02:22:41,290 --> 02:22:41,810
Please.

3289
02:22:42,550 --> 02:22:44,670
Stop giving me more.

3290
02:22:45,490 --> 02:22:48,010
I need other stuff.

3291
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:52,550
Okay, I'm still...

3292
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:54,270
I'm gonna have...

3293
02:22:54,270 --> 02:22:56,150
The most expensive...

3294
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:57,730
Oh wait, maybe I should have this.

3295
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:02,210
Alright, the most expensive presentation.

3296
02:23:02,210 --> 02:23:03,970
Alright, here we go.

3297
02:23:04,190 --> 02:23:05,930
Doraemon, off to you again.

3298
02:23:12,250 --> 02:23:13,010
Fantastic.

3299
02:23:13,530 --> 02:23:14,290
The best.

3300
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:15,350
Wonderful.

3301
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:16,870
Fantastic!

3302
02:23:17,950 --> 02:23:19,210
That's right!

3303
02:23:20,650 --> 02:23:22,330
All you professional chefs.

3304
02:23:23,090 --> 02:23:24,430
That spent years.

3305
02:23:24,910 --> 02:23:26,610
Your loco mochi store.

3306
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:28,530
Your specialty is mochi.

3307
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:29,930
And you lost the children.

3308
02:23:31,030 --> 02:23:32,650
Quit your job.

3309
02:23:33,410 --> 02:23:36,350
Clearly, this was never your career in the first place.

3310
02:23:36,910 --> 02:23:39,550
You might as well quit your job and retire now.

3311
02:23:39,690 --> 02:23:40,670
Oh my god, thank god.

3312
02:23:40,690 --> 02:23:41,610
I finally got points.

3313
02:23:42,010 --> 02:23:43,570
Thank god.

3314
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:48,440
Yay!

3315
02:23:50,220 --> 02:23:51,160
Alright, guys.

3316
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:52,600
I think after...

3317
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:54,840
Sweeping the contest.

3318
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:57,740
I think that's a good way to end the stream.

3319
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:01,220
That was fun though.

3320
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:02,220
That was a fun time.

3321
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:05,080
It was definitely a nice like...

3322
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:07,140
Oh hey, there's my one above all by the way.

3323
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:08,200
Oh, sorry.

3324
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:11,480
It was definitely like a nice just...

3325
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:12,560
Chill session.

3326
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:14,720
And just to like...

3327
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:17,340
I feel like I can definitely play this game a lot.

3328
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:17,960
Offstream.

3329
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:19,980
And just like...

3330
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:22,780
It's like one of those mindless games.

3331
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:25,240
Where you just build and build and build.

3332
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:26,920
Yeah, we own the fucking market.

3333
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:29,100
And like just...

3334
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:31,380
Like mindlessly just keep building.

3335
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:32,940
It's a very comfy, chill game.

3336
02:24:32,980 --> 02:24:33,940
I really enjoyed it a lot.

3337
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:35,300
And it was nice like...

3338
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:36,600
Revisiting my childhood.

3339
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:38,560
And like...

3340
02:24:39,980 --> 02:24:40,500
Explaining...

3341
02:24:41,140 --> 02:24:43,900
The lore of Doraemon to all of you guys.

3342
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:45,340
It's funny how you guys were like...

3343
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:46,320
That can't be the story.

3344
02:24:46,580 --> 02:24:47,760
But it really is.

3345
02:24:48,940 --> 02:24:51,480
It's funny that a lot of you guys forgot that...

3346
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:54,160
Nobita owed like a lot of money to the mafia.

3347
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:55,880
Because he like...

3348
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:57,440
His company burnt down.

3349
02:24:57,620 --> 02:24:58,320
And everything.

3350
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:00,460
And then they became really, really poor.

3351
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:01,680
And you guys were like...

3352
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:03,000
No, that can't be the real story.

3353
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:05,260
Like...

3354
02:25:07,380 --> 02:25:08,180
They like...

3355
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:10,580
They like put it in there like...

3356
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:12,440
In the beginning of the chapter.

3357
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:14,800
So like a lot of people forgot about it.

3358
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:15,500
But I...

3359
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:16,920
For some reason, I remembered.

3360
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:19,640
That was like one of the stories that...

3361
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:21,960
Like that was one of the lore parts that...

3362
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:23,160
I remember from the story.

3363
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:25,940
Papa, thank you for the superchat.

3364
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:26,720

Thanks for showcasing a Kairosoft.

3366
02:25:28,760 --> 02:25:31,060
Be careful though, they're secretly comfy addicting.

3367
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,220
Yeah, it's pretty addicting.

3368
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:33,500
I really enjoyed it.

3369
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:34,620

3373
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:43,600
A portion.

3374
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:46,720
Just like explain to you about like...

3375
02:25:47,820 --> 02:25:49,120
Something from my childhood.

3376
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:50,820
That I grew up with.

3377
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:53,140
And it's definitely been...

3378
02:25:53,140 --> 02:25:54,260
Really fun just playing it.

3379
02:25:54,260 --> 02:25:56,140
And just being comfy and you know...

02:25:56,140 --> 02:25:58,260

And just something that's just a relaxing...

3385
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:08,540
Game of just...

3386

Opening a door...

3387
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:12,380
A sweet, a dorayaki store run by children.

3388
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:14,440
But yeah, thank you everybody.

02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:18,540
I can feel my voice dying today.

3391
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:20,260
So I'm gonna relax...

3392
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:21,920

Get up and move around...

02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:33,840
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.
