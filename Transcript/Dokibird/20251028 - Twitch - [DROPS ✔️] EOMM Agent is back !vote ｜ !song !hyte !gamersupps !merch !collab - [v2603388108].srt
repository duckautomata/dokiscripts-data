1
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,850
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,010
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,230
Let me put the man of the hour, the star of the show on the screen.

4
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,010
Oh, I shouldn't start off with that.

5
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,910
No, this is like, we lead up to it.

6
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,170
It's a build-up.

7
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,250
We don't give it right away.

8
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,590
We gotta lead up to it.

9
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,250
Okay, not good morning.

10
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,270
It's 2.30 in the morning.

11
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,050
Hello, everyone.

12
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,210
Yes, I am back with Marvel Rivals at 2.30 in the morning.

13
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,490
You see, I have a perfectly good explanation for this.

14
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,770
I took a nap.

15
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,510
That's really it.

16
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,150
But that's enough explanation for why I'm here today.

17
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,850
That's enough of a reasoning why.

18
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,010
Like it gives enough context.

19
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,430
I took a nap.

20
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:58,610
And then the thing is I've been wanting to stream rivals for a while because like, you know, like the streamer awards.

21
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:05,230
So for those who don't know, who aren't tournamentally online, the streamer awards was just announced.

22
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,070
And, you know, like you don't really win anything.

23
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,870
Especially as a VTuber because I can't really go to the event because there's cameras everywhere.

24
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:32,190
And like, you know, like there would be like, they tell like nominate like these are the people that are nominated and then you know the camera literally fucking zooms in on the person that's nominated so like you know obviously as a vtuber like i don't really get anything out of this other than uh

25
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:44,270
other than like recognition and like as a content creator that's all we need

26
00:03:48,390 --> 00:04:14,610
honestly recognition and and stroking the ego and that's all i need honestly like i need bragging rights exactly bragging rights exposure i don't even have to win as long as my name is on there i'm like happy for like the rest of the year which is like two months but that's enough for me

27
00:04:20,870 --> 00:05:12,650
another thing to wake up to so um so yes i found out like i like you know this week that um the streamer awards the streamer awards uh just came out for nominations and one of the categories is best marvel rival streamer and obviously you know i'm thinking i don't sometimes i don't even get paid to be like i love marvel rivals like the fact that i uh also fleshy thank you for the rain thank you thank you i hope you had a great stream fleshy i just started my own stream so um and it is two third yes i just started my own stream and it is 2 30 in the morning um but yes uh so i felt you know i was like holy like i want to be there i just want to be nominated i don't i don't i don't think i'll win

28
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,210
because I, I literally, um, promote them, like, for free.

29
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:40,150
Uh, sometimes, you know, sometimes they throw me a bone or two, or throw me 45,000 currency, but, like, you know, or throw me 45,000 units, but, but, you know, I totally do it for free.

30
00:05:40,510 --> 00:06:16,130
Uh, um, um, but, you know, um, I just signed would be pretty cool to be nominated uh yeah quote unquote for free uh practically for free guys practically for free um um but anyway um but then i realized i don't know if they count my youtube hours because like i don't because like the terms and conditions the fine print was like So in order to be voted in this category,

31
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:22,010
you gotta stream like a hundred hours of the game that's to be nominated for.

32
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,450
And I don't fucking, you know, I don't fucking really stream on Twitch that much.

33
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:32,410
I mean, if you look at my broadcast history, um, it's like last time I streamed Marvel Rivals 17 days.

34
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:32,830
I don't know.

35
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,350
I think it was 17 days ago.

36
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,850
And so it doesn't look very nice.

37
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,850
If I get nominated and then they're like, bitch, this person doesn't even stream Rivals.

38
00:06:43,870 --> 00:07:36,790
you know I feel it'd be weird so I was like okay I gotta make sure I gotta make sure I clock my hours in I think I have enough my manager was like yeah you sort of you have a hundred hours but cuz it's like a hundred hours over the year on it's crazy I I was actually so surprised because my manager was like you do have a hundred hours in this year for Twitch only which I was very surprised by it because I was like oh my god on I don't I barely stream on this platform and yet I somehow still got a hundred hours on Twitch as like for arrivals that's how that's how much I this is how much I know I have a problem the fact that like I do have a hundred hours not even on my main platform

39
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,810
Alright, 99% of my Twitch streams are my maravos.

40
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:58,830
And, like, okay, this is, like, how I do believe, like, it might not be a lot for, like, I guess, like, you know, in context with pros who have to scrim this game.

41
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,670
Scrim this game every day.

42
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,170
But, like, it's, this is how many hours I've put in.

43
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,670
I'll show you guys how many hours I've put in since the release of this game.

44
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:41,610
and then because i play off stream i remember like um some uh and some streamers when they see i remember i think it was like moxie and craiggy they saw me on stream like on their own stream while i was playing off stream And they're like, oh my god, she plays off stream Because it's like,

45
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:49,710
it'd be like 4 in the morning And I bump it to Craigie and Moxie And they'd be like, what the fuck is she doing playing off stream?

46
00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:00,150
I'm just like, I just enjoy the game, I'm sorry I, they're like, why is she streaming it?

47
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:10,650
I'm like, I'm sorry, I just enjoy the game I can't even fucking play it off stream I have fun off stream, okay?

48
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,550
Like, God forbid, the grind, exactly.

49
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,250
The grind rests for no one.

50
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,010
Why aren't you locked in?

51
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,970
Bro, I do it for the love of the game, exactly.

52
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:31,670
So, yeah, because like, you know, sometimes I don't want to stream my grind, because sometimes I just play the game and I don't talk.

53
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:42,330
I literally just go, I literally just here to be a fucking healer like I don't I don't fucking talk to anyone I just go and take my heels you bitch like

54
00:09:45,570 --> 00:10:00,990
um um crap thank you for the twitch prime thank you thank you uh uh yeah thank you for the 200 bitties thank you thank you uh yeah so yeah so now I'm awake and now you guys are awake too

55
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:36,790
small steps i i know i need to fix my sleep schedule but also i want to be nominated for marvel rivals right now because i i that's what i was most worried about i was uh honestly most worried that like i was just look at my twitch and be like that's not enough hours because like it's not my main platform but also because like you know i have to sort of be a variety streamer so because like i don't know i could i would stream i'm sorry but like i will be very up front parent.

56
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,390
If I could, I would stream Marvel Rivals every day.

57
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:52,270
But because I know my career is very important, and I did tell myself I should not self-sabotage myself.

58
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,830
I'm a variety streamer.

59
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,450
Yeah, we know.

60
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,970
Born to Marvel Rivals, of course, to variety.

61
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,470
I don't have a problem.

62
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,130
No, you guys are so lucky.

63
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:16,050
You weren't there for my Overwatch and Apex Addiction.

64
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,490
It was just like this, honestly.

65
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,850
It was literally just like this.

66
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,830
But like, the Barth Knights back dead were not so lucky.

67
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,990
I was like, guess what we're having today?

68
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,190
That's right.

69
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,970
More Apex.

70
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,570
That's right.

71
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,150
Oh, guess what we're having tomorrow.

72
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,190
That's right.

73
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,690
Apex again.

74
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,490
And the next day after that, Apex again!

75
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,210
That's all we're having.

76
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,430
Nothing else.

77
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,190
Oh, you think I'm going to talk to you guys?

78
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,770
No, we're just going to fucking play Apex.

79
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,330
So, yes.

80
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,630
Now, you know, now I'm like, I want to play Rivals.

81
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,010
And then my manager would be like, no, you don't.

82
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,250
And I'm like, what?

83
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,570
Like, that's what Twitch is for, for your, for your little shenanigans.

84
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,790
I'm like, okay.

85
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,070
Like, dear God.

86
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,870
But yes, exclamation point vote.

87
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:33,050
If, uh, if, uh, I mean, not if, you will nominate, you will nominate me for best Marvel rival streamer.

88
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,370
What other Marvel rival streamer fucking?

89
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:49,730
advertised Marvel Rivals after concert for free played one game of Rivals right before I had to perform in 3D.

90
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,870
What other Marvel Rival streamers have done that?

91
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,950
That's right.

92
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,030
Me.

93
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,390
Sorry.

94
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:12,610
So, so anyway, also all the pro players right now are, uh, and all the pro players and all the other streamers are doing the land thing at DreamHack.

95
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,730
So it's just the demon hours are free real estate for me right now.

96
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,630
Just because like, you know, all the other streamers got to do that watch party thing.

97
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,890
So no other rival streamer has a 3D concert.

98
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,010
That's because they're already 3D.

99
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,990
It's just a regular concert.

100
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,630
But even then they didn't do a regular concert.

101
00:13:34,470 --> 00:14:44,910
Um, um but yeah so these hours are actual like like i guess like free low hours now not free low for as in i'm gonna win my games but as in no one else is actually sort of streaming today and for the next week um just because like there is that i don't know you guys know but there's a one million dollar land right now uh uh that's going on that started today and because of that all the streamers all the other the real marvel rival streamers uh not the part-time marvel they don't have to know that there's no way they watch this vibe be like we're gonna not make the part-time anyway um not the part-time marvel rival streamer they uh so uh they all have to do like the watch party uh watch party of the million dollar land um so no one they're not gonna be awake at this time also the pro players are definitely not fucking queuing at this time just because you know they kind of be awake to fucking play in the tournament uh a million dollar tournament by the way so um these games might be

102
00:14:44,910 --> 00:15:32,670
very interesting because i have no idea what to expect because we don't have real players online including me um so so i i so honestly i feel like the entire um and to see like which which team once doesn't want it more like honestly because none of the real players online at this time especially at you know almost three in the morning um yeah so we're like you know we're all the part-timers right now they're queuing at the moment um so yeah we'll see how it goes also i have not yet played the game with the voice changers Because if you guys didn't know,

103
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:39,710
Rivals added a new update where people can change their voice.

104
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,910
And I actually don't even know where the fuck that settings look.

105
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,710
I'm so, I'm gonna, I'll let you guys know.

106
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,110
I'll let them talk one time before I mute him.

107
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,390
I, I, like, I, I don't care if like some of you guys think it's, it's not funny to me.

108
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,030
Like, it's so, I don't know.

109
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,050
I find it incredibly annoying.

110
00:16:01,030 --> 00:17:10,470
these streams um um but like uh so there's like all these fucking um add new save oh my god you can adjust the fucking oh my god you can create your own voice changer too but uh from what i've heard from stream from other watching other people's streams it's so bad i i don't like like it at all I understand they want to be like because it's like It's like people it's just so annoying the way people use it Because I understand like oh it makes people want to use comms more But they just give us two settings just do a masculine feminine Don't do like don't give a symbiotic row Because like I can't even hear what they're saying Like I would watch the stream and I won't understand what they're saying Because they choose some fucking dumbass setting like What was it the symbiotic or some shit or like the pumpkin model or alien like I what are you saying you might as well not you might as well like fucking uh just go beep bop beep I it's the same thing I don't even know what you're saying

111
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:32,810
like you might put your mic your microphone next to the microwave that's really it that's all I hear um yeah so so I if anybody uses voice changers on my team I will We can listen to it one time and then I mute them like that.

112
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,850
That's it Do you throw is that why you're called E-O-M-M agent?

113
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,410
I don't throw it's just unlucky

114
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:54,830
It's just unlucky look rivals is a hobby for me So I just I might be cursed that's really it

115
00:17:58,390 --> 00:19:12,210
anyway let's let's queue up i don't know if anyone would be getting on um i don't i feel like carova is fucking left his pc on at the at the lat i heard the pc's were crashing like apparently the the games were like hella delayed um because there were pauses everywhere um during the land i hope it fix it it gets fixed for tamara but that's what i heard like from um from the broadcast that it there were so many pauses because everyone's pc was crashing and so like it made the land go like super over time um no i didn't try the zombie mode i heard the zombie mode is pretty addicting but also i'm not really a pve person um so i don't know i've never really been a pve type person but i did hear it's very addicting i i find the jeff build really funny though like the and bigger and bigger i find uh i find that one pretty silly um because like when you're playing jeff oh all right sure you invite me because i don't like being party leader i don't like being um like i don't like you know

116
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:48,370
pressing requeue that's that's really it i hate that responsibility you know just pressing requeue it's so much exactly it's so much work also makes you your open mic i can hear your birds oh you have birds oh my god yeah unless it's in the morning unless it's it must be like super early or something um but yeah i feel like these hours are like the only like this is for you asia

117
00:19:53,070 --> 00:20:00,410
It's, it's, I don't know if it's unlucky, but like, it's mostly rivals during these hours, but this is for you, Asia.

118
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,050

Finally, and the early morning EUers.

122
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,710
That's for you guys, unfortunately, or fortunately, It's only Marvel Rivals.

123
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,830
But hey.

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,710
Where are my players?

127
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,170
Where are they?

128
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,370
I guess all I have is roleplay.

129
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,650
That's fine.

130
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,570
This is a real game anyway.

131
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,870
Let's see.

132
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:50,890
Oh.

133
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,050
I bought the pumpkin chest.

134
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,750
Yeah!

135
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,790
Sorry, the devs got me the pumpkin, Jeff.

136
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,690
Yeah, it's so cute though.

137
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,770
Wait, is it this?

138
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,390
This.

139
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,510
I got my own pumpkin.

140
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,610
Yum, yum, yum.

141
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,550
Just in time for Halloween.

142
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,470
Hello everyone!

143
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,030
Jeff is here.

144
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,670
I am here to roleplay.

145
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,070
It's so cute.

146
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,070
I find it so.

147
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,390
I actually...

148
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,190
I like all the Jeff skins.

149
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,690
I think Jeff has like all the best support skins.

150
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,670
Whoa, why are we fighting?

151
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,950
This is a role-playing lobby.

152
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,210
I'm selling a BP.

153
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,490
Your name is...

154
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:33,990
Whoa.

155
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:34,730
Hi.

156
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,810
Would you like some candy?

157
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,070
Oh, shit!

158
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,050
I don't think he wants some candy.

159
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:50,190
It was trick-or-treat, and I don't think I got the treat.

160
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,050
I'm breaking role-play.

164
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,260
Being cute ain't for free.

165
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,120
Oh,

166
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,340

Oh, shit.

169
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,820
No.

170
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,400
My god.

171
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,640
He stopped me.

172
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,920
He stopped my grift.

173
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,380
I was about to scam those looters.

174
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,280
He's extortion in my game.

175
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,960
He stopped it.

176
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,840
I was just about to scam them.

177
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,440
He stopped it.

178
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,140
How dare they?

179
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,780
The nom.

180
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,280
Whoa!

181
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,380
I don't know why he hates me so much.

182
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,100
What did I do wrong?

183
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,020
I'm just giving everyone a little bite.

184
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,880
Lexi, thank you for a thousand bitties.

185
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,700
Thank you, thank you.

186
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,740
Thanks for being cute, Doug.

187
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,720
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

188
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,260
Alright, guys, don't judge me.

189
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,640
But I don't want...

190
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,680
Guys, don't judge me.

191
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,260
But this is meta.

192
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,420
You don't understand.

193
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,240
It's meta now, okay?

194
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,500
Like, I don't want to get dope.

195
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,200
I...

196
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,140
Don't judge me.

197
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,380
It's...

198
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm just a meta slave.

199
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,400
I also want to live.

200
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,780
And I don't want to try that much right now.

201
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,260
It's my first game.

202
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,880
Guys.

203
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,640
Sometimes, you know, you just want to hold left click.

204
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,240
Is that too much to ask for?

205
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,780
No, don't worry.

206
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,320
I fixed it.

207
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,840
I just have to have, like, my YouTube studios tabbed in.

208
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,240
Look, it's the first game.

209
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,760
And, like, this is the hero you play when you don't want to try too much.

210
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:28,340
apparently dive is like very oppressive now okay dive is very oppressive and you know sometimes i like being alive okay sometimes it's just being alive it's pretty cool our oh she isn't a try all right who can try at three in the morning we all know why we're here at this time

211
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,540
We all know why we're here.

212
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,780
And it's East Coast server.

213
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,200
So these people are playing at like 6 in the morning.

214
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,540
I have an excuse.

215
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,840
I'm on West Coast.

216
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,880
It's still 3 for me.

217
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,060
Some people here are literally living in East Coast right now.

218
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,680
Playing this game at 6 in the morning.

219
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,160
That's going to be me in 3 hours.

220
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,480
But we don't talk about that.

221
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,420
It'll happen when it happens.

222
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,580
Like, I'm playing at 6 in the morning.

223
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,000
That's right.

224
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,860
Yeah, you are.

225
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,200
That's fine.

226
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,800
We don't need a second support.

227
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,200
I'm Rocky Raccoon.

228
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,620
That's part of Joke.

229
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,400
Yeah, that's right.

230
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,820
I have a court order.

231
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,500
That's why I'm playing Rocket.

232
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,480
Look, see, I can get better.

233
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
Four, three, two, three.

234
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,440
Oh yeah, no, we are doing it.

235
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,220
So let's support our essence as a joke, but that's alright.

236
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,160
It's what I get at 6 in the morning.

237
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,500
It's really what I get honestly.

238
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,480
Like that's understandable.

239
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,040
I knew what I was getting into.

240
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,460
They can't complain about the heals though.

241
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,840
Like this is all I can do.

242
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,420
See look at that.

243
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,440
It's so easy.

244
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:29,960
I feel like when you're playing like any other support, you got to be like on for like the All of the games You have to be like 100% aware, but for this one I just do this I can just do this I don't have to be aware I can be like 200.

245
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,140
I'm not winning.

246
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,580
They're running triple support What the fuck?

247
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,440
They have two more supports than me.

248
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,680
We did it.

249
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,250
I don't know how, but we did it.

250
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,020
The brain not required.

251
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,640
That what makes it fun, you're right.

252
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,920
I don't know how, but I take those.

253
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,860
They literally have two more supports than me.

254
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,980
They have triple the healing.

255
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,840
That's right.

256
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:34,080
I uh how does he get on you have three supports how do you have the same time of all as me that's actually crazy that you the Luna has how much damage were we doing bro I feel like I'm at the end bro what the fuck all the other supports have oh at the same time as me that's actually crazy how I don't know how they were farming this ult.

257
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,920
They should not be farming this ult.

258
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,120
Farming dangerous.

259
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,900
Oh, he fucked up.

260
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,120
It's okay.

261
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,400
I got alt again soon.

262
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,480
It's okay.

263
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,700
It's somehow still working.

264
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,280
Honestly, at this rate, they should actually surrender.

265
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,160
This is sad.

266
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,240
They used all three ults and we still won.

267
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,360
Yeah.

268
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,420
Who would win triple support or one fucking raccoon?

269
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:34,540
that's just sad i'm sorry that's really sad like this should not be working oh oh don't worry i got you don't worry i still got you i don't know how all right here you go go do your thing there you go Yay!

270
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,180
Technically we have two support alts because we have Captain America.

271
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:41,940
Yay!

272
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,020
Honestly, I would be very embarrassed on the enemy team.

273
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,040
Maybe this is the new meta.

274
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
I would say that and then I'm gonna reverse sweep us.

275
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,480
I know it.

276
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,220
I fucking know it.

277
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,320
That's usually how it goes.

278
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:27,160
I get too confident and then like, win the second round and then my team's gonna start yelling each other and then i'm gonna lock myself in the room and cry myself to sleep and be like stop please stop fighting mommy and daddy you volunteered to be experimented on is that true he didn't lie all right too real to hear you Is this...

279
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,960
Are you thinking about something else instead?

280
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,260
Like...

281
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,760
Alright.

282
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,120
Yay!

283
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,760
Yeah,

284
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,320
technically we do have two support elves because there's Captain America.

285
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,140
You're right, two Christmases.

286
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,700
Always remember, Jokey.

287
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,220
We can get two Christmases.

288
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,240
I'm just gonna be here.

289
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,720
Like they can't really see me.

290
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,320
I don't know.

291
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,680
Fuck did this guy.

292
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,640
Did the mag die?

293
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,520
What is going on?

294
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,980
Bro, did we just have all the DPS players?

295
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,920
Okay, see now they have- oh now they have Widow.

296
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,960
Yeah, I don't- one of them is definitely very mad.

297
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,940
I'm gonna say now we have Widow.

298
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,820
I think we're fine putting this here.

299
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:57,920
Oh, that guy's brave that guy's very brave doing that without like any wait where the fuck are they oh okay goodbye oh okay like do we just have all the aimers did you not have one single DPS player they have Lord icon so I assume they do two Christmases and two birthdays this should not be working but I won't complain Oh,

300
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:58,600
goodbye.

301
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,880
It's okay.

302
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,700
I have a res.

303
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,260
Yeah.

304
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,240
I go.

305
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,100
I go heal from five miles away.

306
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,500
Yay.

307
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,800
My whole tea.

308
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,500
Oh, goodbye.

309
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,220
Never mind.

310
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:14,960
Oh.

311
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,160
Oh.

312
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,160
Here you go.

313
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
We, oh.

314
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,000
I was gonna say we can live forever.

315
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,240
Somehow we did.

316
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,080
didn't live forever.

317
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:27,920
I don't understand.

318
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,740
There we go.

319
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,640
Wait, we did it.

320
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:33,400
Yeah.

321
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,420
Me too.

322
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,000
This is the...

323
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,520
This is the 3am keys.

324
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,080
Where your dreams can become reality.

325
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,640
It shouldn't, but like, nothing makes sense at this time.

326
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,180
Nothing makes sense at Demon Hour.

327
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:20,740
it's like teams that should never be winning wins yeah i understand i don't oh they now they have one support hey look see they're like look it worked for them they're like look it worked for this us okay maybe it'll also work i don't think he sees me he sees me

330
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:34,340
there was like no time to actually fucking shoot someone All right, back to my favorite part of the video.

331
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,020
I feel like you don't see Venom anymore.

332
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,380
I can't believe it.

333
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,020
Venom made the roleplay.

334
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,640
How...

335
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,280
They don't appreciate the pioneer of the RP servers.

336
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,180
Hello, everyone.

337
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,440
I am here.

338
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:53,560
Oh, yeah.

339
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,920
Okay, give me a sec.

340
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,640
Now I am here.

341
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,220
Oh, hey.

342
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,560
Wait, where'd everyone go?

343
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,100
Oh, they died.

344
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,980
I'm here to bring joy to the server.

345
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:13,590
I heard it's someone's birthday!

346
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,430
Oh, shit!

347
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,330
It's two birthdays!

348
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:25,710
Let's go!

349
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,210
Yeah, you need to pay respect to the kickfringer.

350
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,790
Let's fucking go!

351
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,070
That's all!

352
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,710
I'm a fucking volleyball evo.

353
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,710
Jesus Christ.

354
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,690
Okay, first I did not realize the new meta.

355
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,430
No way.

356
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,230
Yeah, what the fuck is the funnest you're doing?

357
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,050
Don't worry, guys.

358
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,250
Hello, Peter.

359
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,690
I got you.

360
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,970
We can double the fun.

361
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,830
It's what the ladies want, right?

362
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,990
It's magic mic tower with me and Peter.

363
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,110
That's what we're got.

364
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,350
As-to-as.

365
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,570
As God intended.

366
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,810
It's like, you know, God gave you these cheeks.

367
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,970
Of course you gotta use it.

368
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,130
It would be a crime not to.

369
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,810
Cheek-to-cheek ass ass.

370
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:33,370
Woo!

371
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,250
Let's go!

372
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,970
Don't have to compete with the other Venoms here.

373
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,670
I'm so sad.

374
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,750
I'm so sad that...

375
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,870
That Venoms are such a rare species now in the RP servers.

376
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,870
No one appreciates.

377
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,730
No one remembers the pioneers.

378
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:12,950
of these servers monopolizing the party let's go don't worry oh i was gonna give punisher a good time

379
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:40,210
we can't let the history erase us guys which hero do you think you want to be today you don't understand if daredevil comes in I will not play any other support Don't understand Never forget Exactly I'm not gonna banish from this match

380
00:37:44,750 --> 00:39:02,350
Understandable But yeah no The reason why Rocket Raccoon is back in meta Is because this guy exists And also this guy And also And also this guy And also uh this guy and also uh there's more by the way and also this guy and then this guy and um and this guy so and this guy too so the list goes on and they buff like 50 of these guys oh yeah blade whatever blade's still shit he doesn't really matter is altron still bad yeah there's better triple support to play like people just play this this this rocket Luna uh Invis or Mantis if you have triple and Jeff everything but him why Thor because like he got buffed his damage got buff and everything but yeah this is why I don't play Luna anymore because like Luna now you have to be like 24 7 aware of your entire surroundings and like That's not for some reason that's not fun That's just that's just a little bit too much,

381
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:20,210
you know And like even if you like hit every freeze You know hit every shot you somehow still die so So I rather not deal with that I rather just you know if someone you know what I can do?

382
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:27,550
Okay, so like when you someone dives you as Luna you hit your freeze, but then like Like, you still, you can sometimes, you might still die because no one peels for you.

383
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,590
But you know what I can do when I get dove?

384
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,740
No cooldowns.

385
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,380
Yeah, that, yep.

386
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,220
I literally just go.

387
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,900
I was like, oh, shit, Venom?

388
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,060
That's all I have to do.

389
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,160
Goodbye.

390
00:39:56,540 --> 00:41:14,100

391
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:31,320
oh well oh that's not fair they have a rocket for the penny too they have even more Well, good luck, because my damage is apparently not enough to break that wall.

392
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,920
That's alright.

393
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,500
You know what?

394
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,380
Fuck this.

395
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,060
Oh, I'll use it later, I guess.

396
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,500
No, fuck it.

397
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,100
Let's go.

398
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:48,840
You know what?

399
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,820
That's unfortunate.

400
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,000
Oh, that is very unfortunate for our Luna.

401
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,520
I hope our Luna...

402
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,440
Okay, never mind.

403
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,720
Alright.

404
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:42,860

406
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, I just wanted to reset.

407
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,240
I altered on purpose.

408
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,820
Uh, good luck, I believe.

409
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,940
Are they still fighting him?

410
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,760
Holy- oh shit!

411
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,820
Jesus Christ!

412
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,460
Oh my god.

413
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,840
Okay, there's a little- I do not like this.

414
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:40,920
See, that would have been me if I didn't pick rocket guys that could have been me thank god you gotta pick rocket first before you get before you have to go through hell

415
00:43:46,030 --> 00:44:06,570
good luck guys you can fight him i believe there you go look at that not zero damage oh what the is he doing over there Oh, that's a little awkward.

416
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,210
I mean, I could.

417
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:10,450
Hot alt.

418
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:11,610
Briggs these up.

419
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:12,610
Oh, never mind.

420
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,390
Never mind.

421
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,190
Bruce, he has to live.

422
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,130
Oh, okay.

423
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,490
The double support alt.

424
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,310
Um, okay.

425
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,230
That's...

426
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,750
That's...

427
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,830
Oh, and then he dies!

428
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,130
Yo, do you guys want to shoot their fucking rocket up?

429
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,750
Can you shoot the voice changer?

430
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:42,270
Oh my god, that's interesting that our Invis fucking...

431
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,270
Our Invis fucking...

432
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,830
Okay, I don't know why our Invis ulted that, but that's okay.

433
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,270
You know, we all make mistakes here.

434
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:52,750
Oh, and then we see nine.

435
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:53,990
Okay, that's okay too.

436
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,250
That's okay.

437
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,430
That's okay.

438
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,670
We all make mistakes, guys.

439
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,490
That's okay.

440
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,950
We all...

441
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,250
Oh my god, is that part of the story?

442
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:34,730
software no it's a little too high he's gotta uh he needs to he needs to lower the voice a little more that's crazy like we should not i will say i don't know how three people see nine that there was three people there also our invis is so close to the fucking to like everyone Goodbye.

443
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:35,950
See what I could do?

444
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,510
I could just walk away.

445
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,750
Oh shit, I can't walk away no more.

446
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,430
Oh shit, you blinded me.

447
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:45,770
Oh my god.

448
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:47,510
It's okay.

449
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:48,790
It's okay.

450
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:50,810
There we go.

451
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,470
My team is very special, but you shouldn't expect anything during demon hours.

452
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:00,050
I think I'd win more game if I actually play it during real hours.

453
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,470
Like, what's the fun of that, you know?

454
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,250
You know, it's all about the challenge.

455
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,030
Oh my god.

456
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,530
Goodbye.

457
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,370
Oh shit.

458
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:11,270
Goodbye.

459
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,710
Oh my god.

460
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:21,050
Yeah, that was unfortunate for... Oh my god.

Bro, someone killed a daredevil!

471
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,050
Holy shit!

472
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,810
And to be fair, I feel like I got like 20 ults over my one invis.

473
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,990
Okay, that's fine.

474
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:24,670
It's so fine.

475
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,690
I have tried my vis.

476
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:56,520
to get on point right now all right there we go i can leave point i can't leave point i'm literally the only one on point that's fine it's okay here you go guys i'm here for all of you i'm no longer here for all of you please they fucking how do we keep c9 i don't understand

477
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:15,620
bro how do we keep seeing not hitting this oh he wasn't even okay you know what that makes sense him not being a supportive player that makes a lot of sense

478
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:36,480
dude the only time we don't see nine is when i a little fucking rocket um tiny ass rocket stands on a point against six other players, against the enemy team.

479
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,720
That's the only time we don't see nine.

480
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,580
That's crazy.

481
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,800
That's so sad.

482
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,180
I'm just a little guy, and I have to stand on point.

483
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,120
The fact, oh my god.

484
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,840
Oh, wait, no.

485
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,560
I was going to say, how the fuck does he have 10 deaths?

486
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,360
And I was like, oh, wait.

487
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,800
He was on mag.

488
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,000
Is my current rank?

489
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,900
I haven't played much this season, so I'm only in Celestia 3.

490
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,700
I was Celestia 3.

491
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,920
I was Celestia 2 for the last season, and that was, like, top 500, but I was literally, like, three, four games away from...

492
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,380
Oh, not me!

493
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,240
Not me!

494
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,540
Not me, though.

495
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,480
And then I had to fly out of New York.

496
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,940
So I didn't secure top 500.

497
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,780
I didn't play a lot.

498
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:54,700
this season i've just been like chilling because like this season um this season it's uh supports have it bad if you're not on rocket you might as well like if you're not on rocket you're in hell that's really it and i sometimes you know i i don't want to be in hell

499
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,860
Actually, it pasted me.

500
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:04,700
Whoa!

501
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,800
I do nothing I can do.

502
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,600
And we lost that.

503
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,480
What?

504
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,540
How do you feel about the meta?

505
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,400
Um, it's not fun for supports, apparently.

506
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:35,180
This is also why I didn't play this season, because everyone's telling me how it fucking sucks as a support play, like, for support players, because it's like, you know, um, Like, you actually have, you have to be so aware of everything.

507
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,100
You're not playing Jeff or Rocket.

508
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,620
It's like, you can't really do anything.

509
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,340
I mean, you can, but you saw what happened to it.

510
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,860
Now, watch this happen to me.

511
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,020
You see that?

512
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,640
That's going to happen to me, too.

513
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:51,960
Goodbye.

514
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:03,970
I feel like this is worse than the last dive we've had, honestly.

515
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:07,830
This feels worse than the last dive.

516
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:08,970
Dive meta.

517
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:13,590
Alright, guys.

518
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,090
Oh, nice.

519
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:15,910
We have three support.

520
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,190
Oh, except they're out of contact.

521
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,470
I'm just gonna wait here.

522
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:26,930
Oh, I guess I'll stand here, too.

523
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:27,390
Okay.

524
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:28,870
Alright.

525
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,330
Oh, no, this is bad.

526
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:34,550
Okay, let's go.

527
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:35,250
This is five.

528
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:37,790
This is real firepower.

529
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:38,510
It's okay.

530
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:39,370
It's okay.

531
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,070
I'm right clicking.

532
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,890
That's all I can do.

533
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,270
Oh my god.

534
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,890
You fucking almost died, bro.

535
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,310
There's no way they see this hell, this res, right?

536
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,030
There we go.

537
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,950
Yay, we prolonged our defeat.

538
00:52:59,150 --> 00:52:59,670
Let's go.

539
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,390
Thank you for the raid.

540
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:02,770
Thank you.

541
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:03,390
Thank you.

542
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:04,190
Oh shit.

543
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,370
Never mind, we might not win this.

544
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,270
That's okay.

545
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,390
No one's dying, but it's okay.

546
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,770
But we have a good stream!

547
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,990
Oh yeah, no, this is over.

548
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,130
It may or may not be over.

549
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,330
Bro, I'm sorry, bro, you're so fucking.

550
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,570
Oh wait, wait, unless, unless...

551
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:28,810
Unless!

552
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,030
Oh, never mind, we lost you.

553
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:32,870
Unless!

554
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:33,590
Oh, goodbye!

555
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,030
Bro, I can't, I can't help you, bro.

556
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,630
I can just right click.

557
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,410
Goodbye.

558
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,030
That's all I can do.

559
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:52,650
The thing is, we don't have, we can't play Jeff because Jeff is banned.

560
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:57,850
Jeff is, like, the only thing you can do in this situation, unfortunately.

561
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:02,410
Why do I just put this here?

562
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,450
There's anything there.

563
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:07,370
There we go.

564
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:09,330
Oh, okay, that's fine.

565
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:11,390
We're securing our victory.

566
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:14,410
We don't need the other support of...

567
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:21,030
See, if we didn't do two support of us, we wouldn't have won the fight.

568
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:28,130
It's just, you know, the double security for us.

569
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,490
It was all planned.

570
00:54:32,410 --> 00:55:06,430
all right there we go man if only we had another support that's so unfortunate i guess the plan didn't work as well as i thought it would oh unless unless we got a pick goodbye goodbye holy okay i'm i'm still alive at least oh okay um I leave now.

571
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:08,610
I don't think our...

572
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,370
Oh, unless...

573
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:10,290
Unless...

574
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:11,810
Our Emma still has diamond form.

575
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,110
She's still alive.

576
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,290
But that is still possible.

577
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,670
We're down one.

578
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:22,190
Our infants is face tanking, but that's okay.

579
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,850
Sometimes you got a face tank as a support.

580
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:26,470
And now we leave.

581
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,070
We slowly back up.

582
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,010
I swear.

583
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:31,670
But...

584
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:32,290
Oh, wait.

585
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:33,390
No, our daredevil is ace.

586
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,470
I was like, what has our daredevil...

587
00:55:34,550 --> 00:56:37,300
I was gonna say what has our daredevil done but he's ace I don't know how but he did it all right maybe we can do something with this yay oh goodbye we're doing it guys I don't know I slide to myself hello guys hey hey hey hey Invis okay you I hope you die too I okay that was nice to see you from my fellow support That's okay.

588
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,360
Sometimes, it'd be like that.

589
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,420
Sometimes the other support just doesn't know how to turn around.

590
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,500
It's okay.

591
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,740
We go forward, not backwards in life.

592
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,640
In game, in game.

593
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,940
I hope he gets you too.

594
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,640
Oh, there's someone over there.

595
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,080
Oh, there he is.

596
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,020
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

597
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:05,620
Hey, hey, hey.

598
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,100
I swear to god, I hope he kills you too.

599
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:07,760
I...

600
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,440
Yeah, that's right.

601
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,200
Oh, yeah.

602
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:10,880
Oh, there.

603
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,420
Oh, that's not fun, is it?

604
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,900
Oh, it's not fun, but I actually peeled.

605
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,740
Wow, Toxie.

606
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:33,120
If I see my other support, not helping me when I get tope, I will avoid, I, Redfields avoid me now.

607
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,520
I'll avoid him, too, because he did not turn around.

608
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,440
But, does not turn around.

609
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,100
You know damn well I'm going to bring him to you.

610
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,240
So we'll both fucking suffer.

611
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,400
He has to kill one of us.

612
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,720
And I can climb walls and I know you don't.

613
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:03,820
I'm sorry.

614
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,880
After what I saw.

615
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,280
I'm not going down alone exactly.

616
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,060
honestly i feel like we actually could have won him out of solo support

617
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:34,240
we healed together you die first no not die together i literally brought the daredevil to our invas and she was fucked i guess daredevil was like that's an easier target i was like yeah i know

618
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:50,690
so what does the invas have yeah she has push she has like in this jump but when she had the thing is me climbing a wall has zero cooldown

619
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:18,720
so i know who he's gonna chase when he didn't support me first i still peeled for him when the third double went after i still shot my heels at him he never even turned around for me i still healed him.

620
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:24,760
It was not my fault that my heals might not be strong enough for Daredevil.

621
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:25,840
That's not on me.

622
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,580
That's on Barbell Rivals.

623
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:32,380
They just gotta these are above rocket again.

624
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,800
Give him like 100 kilos per orb or some shit.

625
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:37,680
Might as well.

626
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,030
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

627
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:55,390
Can't bring me down.

628
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,670
Today's a raccoon day.

629
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,210
What happened to me, guys?

630
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:07,570
I've changed.

631
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,610
You don't understand, chat.

632
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,650
So many things happened this season.

633
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,510
Did you not see what they did to Invisible Woman?

634
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,550
Did you not see them gang up on her?

635
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:25,410
If I wasn't Rocket, that could have been me.

636
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,830
I live longer to become what I hate.

637
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,350
Oh, thank God.

638
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:35,670
Their devil got banned.

639
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:38,730
Arlo, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

640
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,670
Thank you, thank you.

641
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,150
Elo hell has changed me.

642
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:41,710
It has.

643
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:45,830
I mean, it's called Survival of the Fetis.

644
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,050
And I'm here to survive.

645
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:56,030
If I was a Luna over there, I'd be lucky to be alive for like 20 seconds.

646
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,410
be like triple digits.

647
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:11,650
Sorry, I'm thinking about Twitch Prime.

648
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:12,010
Thank you.

649
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:12,790
Thank you.

650
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:17,370
This is surviving if you lose.

651
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:18,570
Yes, I'd feel better.

652
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:24,670
I'd feel better knowing that I lost and I only have single digit deaths.

653
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:25,530
I...

654
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:34,290
Did you not see how many devs Red Thrill's ad?

655
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:36,210
He had like fucking 12 or something.

656
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:37,450
He had like 15.

657
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:39,990
Thank God I'm not that guy.

658
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:48,070
He had fucking 15 devs, bro.

659
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,030
I think even more, I'm pretty sure.

660
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:55,090
Because he started with 10 before we did attack.

661
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,790
Bro, there is no K in...

662
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:01,030
There's no K in Rocket, bro.

663
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,090
It's like, it's DA.

664
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:06,430
kills it's it's just da

665
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:44,920
like rocket rocket killing maybe like one stray bullet just accidentally hits the head oh shit oh wait wait a minute it's okay that's how I won my first game today surely it'll work again all right oh my The worst part is I actually have to play closer so my heels get to them.

666
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:45,620
Oh, goodbye.

667
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:58,000
I guess not not fast enough, I guess Bro, I'm fucking catch this Just catch my orb There's nothing I can do.

668
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:07,140
You just gotta catch it We're just gonna play catch that's literally the only thing I can do Bro, what the fuck?

669
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,040
Why do they give them two some?

670
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,140
Oh my god, please They...

671
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,100
They fucking good.

672
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,900
This is real firepower.

673
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,720
You're ready for action.

674
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,220
All right.

675
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:23,660
My good.

676
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,660
All right.

677
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,220
This fire.

678
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,620
Just ricochet.

679
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:31,380
There you go.

680
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:31,700
Did you see that?

681
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:36,800
Like, did you see that orb fucking bounce back to me and set up to the team?

682
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,820
Simple geometry ain't so simple.

683
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,180
Who would have thought?

684
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,720
It's way too RNG bouncing off the fucking walls.

685
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:48,400
Oh.

686
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,760
Surely he's not gonna eat me, right?

687
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:53,640
Yeah.

688
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:54,480
Oh.

689
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,800
Oh, I didn't see her.

690
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,420
I should have fucking destroyed it.

691
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,340
Um.

692
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,360
Oh my god, two!

693
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,980
How the fuck did he get two?

694
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,860
I was very surprised.

695
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:09,980
Good luck.

696
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,460
There's still a chance to stop them.

697
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:13,980
Hello.

698
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:16,300
Oh, catch this aura.

699
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,860
Hey guys, are we?

700
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:21,580
All right.

701
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:22,720
All right.

702
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,020
Look, I did my best.

703
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:32,540
I'm surprised I survived long enough.

704
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,460
Oh, yeah.

705
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,860
Well, what was the goal with that?

706
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,300
Yeah.

707
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,340
Edgar, shut the fuck up.

708
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,120
Whoa!

709
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:42,820
Oh!

710
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:53,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, bro,

711
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,420
Zio, I don't think he's okay.

712
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,280
I think there's, I think there's problems at home.

713
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:08,780
I think there might be problems at home, guys.

714
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,080
Oh my God, bro.

715
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,200
It's like seven in the morning.

716
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,040
He's out here saying some gamer words.

717
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,400
I'm afraid of what?

718
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:28,340
Bro, I think there's issues beyond rivals.

719
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:33,560
I don't think rivals is the right type of therapy, bro.

720
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:37,620
There you go.

721
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,720
This is real firepower.

722
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:41,620
Yeah.

723
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,000
Jesus Christ.

724
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,720
has taken so much damage here.

725
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,680
Oh, hey, we have another support.

726
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,620
I was not expecting that.

727
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:58,380
I didn't go on the roof.

728
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,380
That's my bad.

729
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,460
But to be fair, I don't think that res would save anyone.

730
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,600
I thought I could throw that roof in the...

731
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,260
I could throw that res on the roof and then like...

732
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,720
And then the roof fucking collapsed.

733
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,700
Like, I don't think it was possible.

734
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:19,760
Oh.

735
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,100
Holy fuck.

736
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:26,040
I mean, I could learn Jeff.

737
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,940
At this point, might as well.

738
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,440
I don't think this is winnable.

739
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,580
I think it's learning Jeff hours.

740
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,540
It's okay.

741
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:48,200
Well, it's not okay, but like, I'm okay.

742
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,920
It's not okay for him, but I'm okay.

743
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,740
Hey, guys, you just want to move up?

744
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,400
Because the point is over there.

745
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,140
I don't understand why we're, like, at our spot.

746
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,060
Hey, do we have...

747
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,740
Where's our Luna?

748
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:04,120
Oh.

749
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:06,380
Oh.

750
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,200
What?

751
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:12,460
What?

752
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,200
What?

753
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,600
Um, not my fault.

754
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,380
I ulted.

755
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,720
Oh, there you go.

756
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,560
For your crime of double-alting, you get eaten.

757
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,180
I guess.

758
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,540
That's very unfortunate.

759
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:33,040
Bro, my ult came out like a whole five seconds earlier.

760
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,780
I'm honestly.

761
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,100
My ult literally came out five seconds early.

762
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:44,880
Don't worry.

763
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:45,600
Geometry!

764
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:46,420
Sorry.

765
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,600
Her crystal is very...

766
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,980
Wait, we won that?

767
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:52,560
That's crazy.

768
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:57,760
We still don't have a second support up, but hey, it's the little things

769
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:20,040
He was very armed and dangerous We had to double support up like oh It would have been you know what would have been cool if we had another support up But that's silly right that's so silly

770
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,300
Oh, where the fuck is our sword going?

771
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:26,760
Yay!

772
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,220
Oh, shit!

773
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,040
Okay, it's fine.

774
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,240
I think they're fine, right?

775
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:34,860
Yeah.

776
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:37,860
See, I believe.

777
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,820
That's why I didn't pick Jeff.

778
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,800
I didn't swap to Jeff.

779
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,500
See, that's how much I believe.

780
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,540
Alright, I have my ult now, so...

781
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:53,900
I would try and give our Luna ult, But also, I...

782
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,500
Well, yep.

783
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,100
Goodbye, Luna.

784
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,240
Unfortunately, our Luna is gone now.

785
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,520
I don't think I need...

786
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,140
Oh, yeah.

787
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,640
Yeah, we win this.

788
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:09,080
Yeah, we definitely win this.

789
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,420
Yeah, you gotta stand in front of me because my entire team needs health right now.

790
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,460
Like...

791
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:23,460
I was gonna say, like, if you want health, stand here.

792
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,620
Stand in my POV.

793
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,840
Alright, I'll try and give our Luna heals.

794
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:31,440
Alright.

795
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:34,480
I don't think we need that, but that's okay.

796
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,800
Yummy, yummy.

797
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:40,540
Yay!

798
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,340
One more foot.

799
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,820
One more foot.

800
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,760
Is this fun to watch?

801
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:50,700
Bruh.

802
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,300
Who needs skill?

803
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,940
Thrilling gameplay right here.

804
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,300
Technically, I don't even have to move.

805
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,260
Okay, our Luna can actually die from this, so we gotta stack this.

806
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,360
We actually have to stack.

807
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,080
Look at that.

808
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,280
Technically, I don't even have to move if you think about it.

809
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:21,860
Like...

810
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:56,350
I just move just for the sake I just I move just because I you know it's just reflex at that point when I play real support play support characters for some reason they just don't know I exist so it take like I could still do heals from here moving is variety moving is a choice Play of the game.

811
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,690
No way.

812
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:05,070
He's real to me.

813
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,950
But yeah, technically...

814
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:15,690
I move when I play a real support character.

815
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,860
Yeah, I'm playing tower defense right now.

816
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:23,790
Quotaw.

817
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:51,050
quote-blank I could just tape my left was it I don't remember which mouse button the heels at how much I don't care as a rocket oh is it okay right click I could technically grab tape tape my right button right click button down and AFK and Like, go to the bathroom.

818
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:56,090
Oh, yeah, get, like, what was it called?

819
01:11:56,430 --> 01:12:01,830
No, I play Cookie Clicker, and you get, like, something that, like, just presses the cookies for you.

820
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,340
Yeah, I can get an auto-clicker.

821
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,540
So why do I just get...

822
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,020
Can I get mad for that?

823
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,960
If I get an auto-clicker and just that blind right-click?

824
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:18,900
Probably.

825
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,360
Yeah, you get...

826
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,280
And bro, on rocket?

827
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,200
Imagine auto-clicking on rocket.

828
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:36,060
That would be like the day where I was like, I'm ready to beat my addiction.

829
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,150
It's the only way to get me to uninstall.

830
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:46,090
To get banned.

831
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:51,410
Oh yeah, no, he's fucking dead, dead.

832
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,410
Bro, what do you want me to do?

833
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:59,350
If I could, I threw- throw my balls faster!

834
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:06,010
My god, I already have 90%?

835
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,030
Jesus Christ, my tanks are beaters.

836
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:09,410
You know what?

837
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:10,130
Fuck it.

838
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:13,710
It's God.

839
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:18,310
I did not think that they could destroy it that fast.

840
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:24,490
You know, I- guys, I- Oh my god.

841
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:26,290
Okay, he's going again now.

842
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:29,530
To be fair, I did get the Bucky all out.

843
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:34,250
I got the Bucky all out.

844
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:36,950
Oh, our story is done.

845
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:39,570
He's done, done.

846
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,850
I would have to report it in.

847
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:47,530
Like, I, bro, I know, like, life in the...

848
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:52,510
Maybe, like, life right now, IRL ain't so good right now.

849
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:54,470
But I don't think rivals the answer.

850
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,490
you might need a touch grasp.

851
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:00,050
Wait.

852
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,410
There you go.

853
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,090
That's fucking right, Raccoon beats Shark.

854
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:10,210
Not in real life, but I mean, I'm fucking cool.

855
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:11,650
Oh, shit!

856
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:18,010
Alright, someone better stack on that because that can actually kill her now.

857
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:22,490
Jesus, no!

858
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:25,410
What the fuck?

859
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:26,490
I was like, no!

860
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,470
I did not think he'd be up there.

861
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:39,150
I was not fast enough for that.

862
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:41,910
Oh my god, wait.

863
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:43,150
Rixie lived?

864
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:44,970
Was it my res?

865
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:46,990
How the fuck was he alive?

866
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:53,290
Never mind, shark does be raccoon.

867
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,030
Who would have thought?

868
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:00,430
Shark did be Raccoon.

869
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:06,310
Yeah, he didn't...

870
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,750
Doesn't say land shark?

871
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:09,130
That was lie to you.

872
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,910
I was told he was a land shark.

873
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:15,310
When the fuck did he become an air shark?

874
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:18,170
I mean, I could technically just heal from here.

875
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:24,570
Maybe they'll come over.

876
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:25,350
I don't know.

877
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:27,090
Oh, wait.

878
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:27,590
Can I...

879
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:30,590
Can I hit that down here?

880
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:37,490
Oh, wait, unless Maybe I can actually Simple geometry this or shoot through this Hole.

881
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:41,750
This might be easier Honestly, this could be easier

882
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:49,350
Yay What am I ADing for?

883
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:51,370
Why do I need a Shreve?

884
01:15:54,890 --> 01:16:02,590
Here's the hole That will eventually hit them, I think I think it'll be fine She can build support our...

885
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:05,990
Oh.

886
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:08,590
They might be dead, but like...

887
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:09,750
Who knows?

888
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:12,710
Oh, see, they're alive!

889
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,590
Well, not him, but...

890
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:15,810
There you go.

891
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:19,750
Oh, goodbye.

892
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:23,650
I mean, almost work.

893
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:24,770
Maybe she'll...

894
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:27,590
I'm hoping...

895
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:30,330
Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm hoping you'll eat her instead of me.

896
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,290
There we go.

897
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,290
I can literally just stay here.

898
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:37,830
Like I said, what the?

899
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:39,110
What the fuck?

900
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:41,150
Okay.

901
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,390
Where did he go?

902
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:43,930
Why?

903
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:45,310
How did he get here?

904
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,600
I thought that was my teammate.

905
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:56,660
That actually...

906
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,120
Oh, was that from the...

907
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:58,800
Oh my god.

908
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,240
I was like, where the fuck did this guy come from?

909
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,780
I was not expecting that.

910
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:07,760
Look, it's slowly heading over.

911
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,500
Yeah, what?

912
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,920
How did he hit that?

913
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,020
Oh, he missed.

914
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:16,760
That's sad.

915
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:17,800
Oh.

916
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,420
Alright, here we go.

917
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,860
Oh, I go heal this way.

918
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,000
It's fine.

919
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,720
There you go.

920
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,300
They won't know I'm here.

921
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:39,560
They won't know.

922
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:40,760
Oh, it's okay.

923
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,220
They're not coming on the other side.

924
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,580
So I can do this.

925
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,480
Oh, don't worry.

926
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,200
I got you.

927
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,100
He's coming over, but I still got you.

928
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:49,980
Okay, that's strange.

929
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,520
Literally, he came back just to die.

930
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,300
That's so sad.

931
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,300
I mean, I can technically put this here.

932
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,120
Like, I'm doing my best to keep you up right now.

933
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:02,920
Oh.

934
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:11,420
just in case just in case just in case just in case

935
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:24,800
i mean that's fine that's okay i'm still alive see look at that my luna is still alive

936
01:18:29,260 --> 01:19:05,020
yeah i mean this is not the best gameplay to nominate me for marvel rival streamer but like we get what we can get see that duna could have been me guys that could have been me guys i could have been eaten by that jeff and just left to die but instead look at me go no this this is this is real rivals gameplay right there it's not about the crazy place that you can do on dialogue or the 20th freeze.

937
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:06,920
It's the right clicks.

938
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,080
It's the hardest job in the game.

939
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,620
Alright, I gotta leave.

940
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,560
So I can right click here.

941
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,100
Goodbye, Riggzy.

942
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,460
Oh my god!

943
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,320
I can be here, though.

944
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,920
Now I can be back here.

945
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:34,720
And I'll be So, oh, it's okay.

946
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,780
You can catch it.

947
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:36,780
Oh, shit.

948
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,580
What the fuck is he doing there?

949
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,500
You can't get me.

950
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,640
He might have got me.

951
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,380
He might have got me, guys.

952
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:57,620
What?

953
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,040
Oh, is that supposed to know he was going to get me?

954
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,460
Okay, I might be able to grab all here.

955
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,460
All I have to do is just...

956
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,040
I'm 89.

957
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,420
Just live, just live.

958
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,500
That's all that matters.

959
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:13,260
Just live.

960
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,080
Just live.

961
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,120
They didn't live, but that's okay.

962
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:21,980
Can we...

963
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:22,880
Oh, goodbye, all.

964
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:24,540
Bye.

965
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:27,200
Guys, I think we lost this.

966
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:32,970
Oh my god.

967
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:33,230
Okay.

968
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:38,410
It's not fine, but it's okay.

969
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:50,990
Look, I knew that this was gonna be what was gonna happen.

970
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,950
I had a feeling.

971
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,330
It was sort of pretty obvious.

972
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,160
It was sort of very obvious.

973
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:12,550
We blame the gamer.

974
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:23,630
It's it's sort of they gave us a little hope there I sort of have a feeling how this game was gonna go

975
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:46,110
I try I don't know if I did try that hard I didn't even I'm thinking like how much can I try as rocket like how how much can you actually do I think if I- I don't know if I went through that portal?

976
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:48,790
I don't know if I would have lived.

977
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:50,930
Alright.

978
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:53,590
What is it this guy, right?

979
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:56,050
Report player.

980
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:58,870
Voice chat of abuse.

981
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:00,810
I think, yeah.

982
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:02,890
Very much hate speech.

983
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:05,850
I'm gonna use the...

984
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:06,950
Let me use the bathroom.

985
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:07,810
We're back, guys.

986
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:11,690
I'm back.

987
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:12,490
Okay.

988
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:45,630
I might play something else that's not rocket and then die 20 times just for you guys so you know the real pain as to why I have to play that character oh my god but we have a penny I'm sorry I lied we have a pen I lied never mind we got a penny When will I ever get a penny?

989
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:49,110
I get...

990
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:51,490
We can have three mines.

991
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,870
Why the fuck would they ever been?

992
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,530
Why would they ever been?

993
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:03,210
Rocket.

994
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:04,110
Are they gonna...

995
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:04,670
Are you trolling?

996
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,530
There's no way.

997
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:09,210
That's fucking stupid.

998
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:11,450
If they try and ban Rocket.

999
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:12,610
He has...

1000
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:13,310
He lives...

1001
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:15,370
He gives no impact to this game.

1002
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:18,250
Even if they don't Venheller, it's way easier for me to kill off.

1003
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:22,270
Fuck that.

1004
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:24,130
I don't want to deal with Venom.

1005
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:28,910
I swear to God, if he wins the 20%, he's gotta do the lottery.

1006
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:34,730
Okay, double Venom.

1007
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:35,730
That's fine.

1008
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:36,870
I'd rather not have Venom.

1009
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,390
I was like, there's no way this guy wins the double lottery.

1010
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:44,690
There's no fucking way.

1011
01:24:49,300 --> 01:25:13,800
okay next game if I don't get a pet next game and then there was never a next game is there donkey next game I'll play an actual real support that teammates bad Luna and strange yeah okay but what season there's no way they would do it for this season

1012
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:24,200
Like, like, people in the lower elos, they ban penny.

1013
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,400
And I'm like, why?

1014
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:34,100
People in the lower elos, you ban fucking penny of all characters, because they don't know how to handle penny.

1015
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,820
You just don't know what to do against penny.

1016
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:40,340
Which is crazy.

1017
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,840
You just turn around and shoot her.

1018
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:44,860
Like, look how big she is.

1019
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,760
You just turn around and shoot her.

1020
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:51,600
There's a fucking little girl inside that robot.

1021
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,140
You scared of a little girl?

1022
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,380
What the?

1023
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,620
Where are we?

1024
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:09,700
What the?

1025
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,000
Where are we?

1026
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,960
I was so confused.

1027
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,700
Were he TPed?

1028
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,740
Why would you TP there?

1029
01:26:21,500 --> 01:27:15,680

1030
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:20,680
go here.

1031
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,560
Oh, shit.

1032
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,660
That's good.

1033
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,260
Oh, that is not good for me.

1034
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:28,660
There you go.

1035
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,340
Oh, I got it, though.

1036
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,480
Infus got rest.

1037
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,000
Did they do anything with my luck?

1038
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:39,620
I don't think they did anything with my luck.

1039
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,160
I don't think.

1040
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,200
I did not see that hot guy.

1041
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,620
If I saw that hot guy, I would not have fucking position missile there.

1042
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:50,960
Or it may be like, you know, not You go!

1043
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,020
You go, Widow!

1044
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:55,180
Oh shit!

1045
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:56,500
We're winning the fight!

1046
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,700
It's fighter time!

1047
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,200
We were winning the fight.

1048
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:02,900
Oh!

1049
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:06,080
I mean, I'll be here?

1050
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,140
I don't know what's going on, but...

1051
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:11,460
Okay.

1052
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,200
Wait, where is my rest?

1053
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:16,960
Okay, it's over there.

1054
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:19,700
All right, see we did it!

1055
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,260
It's like a penny versus a penny right now.

1056
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:33,210
It sucks because they're running such an OP comp with Namur Hela.

1057
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:35,890
Namur Hela team up is so fucking OP now.

1058
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:40,450
Hello.

1059
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:42,710
This is where...

1060
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:42,850
Oh!

1061
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,410
That's fine.

1062
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:45,090
You'll be fine.

1063
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:46,130
You can handle this.

1064
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:47,830
You're a strong independent woman.

1065
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:51,650
And you also have a cloak with you.

1066
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:52,230
Where are you?

1067
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:54,630
How?

1068
01:28:55,690 --> 01:28:57,290
Where did they shoot my res?

1069
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:01,970
Ooh, got hit.

1070
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,890
Oh, it's just a widow.

1071
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:04,330
That's fine.

1072
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:07,270
I didn't even know they could hit my res.

1073
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:09,510
That's so shy.

1074
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:11,150
I was like, you can do that?

1075
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:12,510
Oh, goodbye, Penny.

1076
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:17,850
Maybe, maybe don't stand next to the only place the Angela can kill you.

1077
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:19,770
Wait, yeah.

1078
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:20,790
Wait, why the fuck?

1079
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:30,090
Literally, there's no other place that Angela could have fucking killed the penny.

1080
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:35,250
I'll just send her off the ledge.

1081
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:36,930
Oh, shit.

1082
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:37,630
Nice.

1083
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,130
Oh, goodbye.

1084
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:45,430
There's no way they see this, this res in front of me.

1085
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:47,250
Goodbye.

1086
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:50,930
Oh, hello.

1087
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:52,970
Hello?

1088
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:53,910
Hello!

1089
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:59,070
Alright, don't get Hawkeye!

1090
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:03,630
Alright, I'm gonna keep my...

1091
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:07,350
Actually, I'll let Cloak do her ult first.

1092
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:10,330
Like, I believe...

1093
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:14,230
Alright, I'll put this here.

1094
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:15,390
I believe in our Cloak!

1095
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,030
Okay, I...

1096
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:20,550
Okay, I...

1097
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:24,850
There's no excuse for a Mac to be there.

1098
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:26,310
I'll just say that.

1099
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:29,690
Um.

1100
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,390
Goodbye.

1101
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:36,050
There's no reason for me to hold out of there.

1102
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:38,190
Two of us for no.

1103
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:38,410
Oh.

1104
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:40,650
Alright.

1105
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,630
I think our hella might instantly.

1106
01:30:43,790 --> 01:30:43,970
Yep.

1107
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,690
Goodbye.

1108
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:48,210
Uh, cloak, cloak, cloak, cloak, cloak.

1109
01:30:48,830 --> 01:30:49,430
Okay, okay.

1110
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:49,850
That's cool.

1111
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:50,310
That's cool.

1112
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:52,310
You know, my old...

1113
01:30:52,330 --> 01:31:10,130
would not have saved you but that's okay i don't know why i cloaked in and out there this was the perfect time cloak it truly was there was only one time to out there cloak and that was that day that's okay

1114
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:15,270
i get

1115
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:23,730
it it peaked one time one time I wanted to be.

1116
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:27,170
Look, this is the one time you can use your ult.

1117
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:28,610
This is literally the one time.

1118
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:30,030
This is, okay, it's fine.

1119
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:32,030
It's fine.

1120
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:37,230
It's okay, it's okay.

1121
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:38,310
We don't need my ult.

1122
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:41,190
You know what?

1123
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:41,630
Fuck it.

1124
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:42,730
I'm gonna do it.

1125
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:44,270
I'm gonna do it.

1126
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:46,550
Just to kill it.

1127
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:47,370
Oh.

1128
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:51,710
I don't know.

1129
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:52,310
I want her.

1130
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:53,950
Arnold first, but that's okay.

1131
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:58,490
I feel like she should have ulted first, but that's okay.

1132
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:00,890
Oh, there we go.

1133
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,610
We got the up.

1134
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:06,590
Because there are so many times when...

1135
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:07,070
Oh, never mind.

1136
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:07,650
She's dead.

1137
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:08,010
Okay.

1138
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,090
That's so unfortunate.

1139
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:13,490
Wait, we don't even have a penny.

1140
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:14,730
Why am I this character?

1141
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:18,770
I only did it for her!

1142
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:20,070
Okay.

1143
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:26,010
That is surprising that I live.

1144
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:30,680
Alright.

1145
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:35,340
It's okay.

1146
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:37,900
Oh, wait.

1147
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,020
No, she is still Penny.

1148
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,980
Wait, did he fuck it up?

1149
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,080
Oh, he got snared.

1150
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:44,820
That's okay.

1151
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:48,700
Yeah.

1152
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,840
We're doing something.

1153
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,340
I think I might need a...

1154
01:32:55,340 --> 01:33:02,640
I want to, I'm gonna, it's so risky, but I'm gonna get rid of my res and then shove it into this hole.

1155
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:04,600
Yay, we did it!

1156
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,580
Let's go.

1157
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:13,000
The stream rewards have so many categories.

1158
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,300
I close it.

1159
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,980
You know how, you know what you can do?

1160
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,240
Just put Jokey button on all the categories.

1161
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:23,960
Just do that.

1162
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:54,620
the whole circle exactly i don't know okay he lives i was gonna say all right don't worry i've got this watch oh not yet not yet though they're not pushing in the moment they push in oh never mind we have us we have a captain america it's like a it's like a third support I mean,

1163
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,560
I could put it...

1164
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:55,660
Oh.

1165
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,320
Hey, they're breaking my rocket up.

1166
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,980
How come we can't do that on the other side?

1167
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:08,720
Don't worry.

1168
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,060
Geometrying right now.

1169
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:11,760
That's so cool.

1170
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:15,200
I wish I know how that feels when we do that for them.

1171
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,060
Oh, well.

1172
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,580
You think he knows I'm here?

1173
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:21,120
Oh.

1174
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:22,800
Oh shit.

1175
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,980
Well, I got you.

1176
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,280
I do think we gotta have someone on the point, though.

1177
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,480
Now I actually have to move because they have a hot guy.

1178
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:41,660
And I think that he'll, if he sees me standing there, I will most definitely get headshot.

1179
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,900
I don't want to risk it.

1180
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,620
I could feel the headshot from...

1181
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,260
Alright, nice.

1182
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,580
No head, no headshot.

1183
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,860
No head, unfortunately.

1184
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,640
For the Hawkeye.

1185
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,800
Hey, you know what would be cool?

1186
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,300
If you guys can destroy their rocket alt.

1187
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,860
That would be so...

1188
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:12,080
It's pretty neat, though.

1189
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:15,240
Hey, how come their rocket alt is still around, guys?

1190
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:20,460
Okay.

1191
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,920
Oh, say goodbye to my rock at all.

1192
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:31,580
How did he destroy it so fast?

1193
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:32,600
Jesus Christ.

1194
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,660
Maybe I should start putting it in cover.

1195
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,660
That's the tip.

1196
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:44,980
Sound, sound, sound, sound.

1197
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,700
That thing got obliterated.

1198
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:52,960
That sucks there's less cover and attack.

1199
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,140
So much less cover and attack.

1200
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:58,420
I just had to throw it in there.

1201
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,200
It's a hell Mary.

1202
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:04,000
You know, we went pretty far.

1203
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:05,720
I did not expect us to go that far.

1204
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,200
Yeah, my five second up.

1205
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,260
I got scared too because the Bucky ulted.

1206
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,200
And I was like, I just got to throw it in.

1207
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:16,640
I had to throw it in.

1208
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,280
I couldn't like...

1209
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:21,740
I couldn't like, you know, do like home decorator.

1210
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,160
Be like, hmm, what would be the perfect place?

1211
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,260
Where, um...

1212
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:26,920
Uh...

1213
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,360
Where, you know, the N18 can't see it.

1214
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:35,180
Literally Bucky Olsen.

1215
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,840
I was like, I gotta put it down now!

1216
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,860
Cap 2 home decorator!

1217
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:43,520
I was like, hmm, do you think if I put it here, the feng shui would be better, guys?

1218
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,820
Yeah, I can't think about the feng shui.

1219
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:50,300
Unfortunately.

1220
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:01,430
Yeah.

1221
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:04,150
Oh, why?

1222
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,270
Oh, I shouldn't have healed that.

1223
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:06,550
I should have just chilled

1224
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:14,710
They're different for the new penny skin, are they?

1225
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:17,290
Oh, yeah I was paying attention.

1226
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:30,870
They are, look Oh my god, it's like, oh, that's so Oh, shit, oh shit, I hear something I was like, I can't Oh, I hear the Angelo Good shot

1227
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:36,310
Don't worry, I'll hit the wall.

1228
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:40,610
I don't want to peek the Hawkeye.

1229
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:41,590
I'm a little scared.

1230
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:43,130
I'm just going to use the wall.

1231
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:46,230
And just geometry this shit.

1232
01:37:47,150 --> 01:37:47,450
I don't know.

1233
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:49,470
The Hawkeye sort of scares me a little.

1234
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:54,570
Because if you're still playing Hawkeye in this meta, he's not afraid.

1235
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:56,750
He's not scared.

1236
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,910
Look at that angle.

1237
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:01,290
I know.

1238
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:02,190
Shit!

1239
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:05,170
There's ammo above us.

1240
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:05,350
Yeah.

1241
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:05,730
Oh,

1242
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:09,950
goodbye Strange.

1243
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:11,190
It's okay.

1244
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:12,510
I have res.

1245
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:13,970
Oh.

1246
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:14,590
I'm not dead.

1247
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,050
No, you're back.

1248
01:38:16,210 --> 01:38:17,570
It's like you never died.

1249
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:19,390
Look at that.

1250
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:23,090
Heroes never die.

1251
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:24,810
Goodbye, Penny.

1252
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:27,670
Oh, hello, Penny.

1253
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:29,030
Oh, Strange!

1254
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:30,590
Oh my god, Strange.

1255
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:37,750
Oh, I got the wa- Oh, see, this is why I don't keep.

1256
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:39,470
How the fuck?

1257
01:38:39,650 --> 01:38:41,050
I'm 68%.

1258
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:42,110
Who is he healing?

1259
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:46,430
Who the fuck is letting him farm damage?

1260
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:48,310
Man, I need to do 50p, Mr. Stange.

1261
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:53,970
Um, he's still being resed right now, so good luck, everyone.

1262
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,850
Why can I confess?

1263
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:57,870
Um...

1264
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:00,030
Um...

1265
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:01,950
Why did...

1266
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:45,030
why did no one touch guys that's so awkward you know what we could have had one person touch it one is one oh yeah no you know bro how the fuck does this racket like who the fuck was you know what like who is he farming that's what i want to know who the fuck was that guy farming there you go there's no way they can break it now that's fucking right look at that that's some feng shui shit right here i leave and then

1267
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:52,290
okay that that's what you know i got feng shui

1268
01:39:55,930 --> 01:39:56,970
He's dead.

1269
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:02,130
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1270
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:09,110
And somebody promised, well, I'm just chilling!

1271
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:10,930
I'm not grinding for anything!

1272
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:12,470
I'm just having fun!

1273
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:16,730
And also I want to be nominated for my rival streamer.

1274
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:20,470
Huge fun story for that.

1275
01:40:24,050 --> 01:40:54,070
guys i think like all my hours literally of raccoon i have more hours of raccoon this season and the entirety of all the other seasons i played rocking raccoon which is crazy to think about hey there's a hello right behind us but like oh wait oh and there's that guy too oh and there's him too Hey Luna,

1276
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:55,870
you want to save our strange?

1277
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:56,930
I guess not.

1278
01:40:57,110 --> 01:40:57,330
It's cool.

1279
01:40:57,570 --> 01:40:58,210
Fuck that guy, I guess.

1280
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:03,450
We don't care about him.

1281
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:04,630
I get that.

1282
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:05,710
Oh fuck her.

1283
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:08,270
Oh, she doesn't care about her stuff, too.

1284
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:09,710
This is why I don't peek.

1285
01:41:11,790 --> 01:41:15,370
To be fair, she was sort of stuck there, which is understandable.

1286
01:41:16,430 --> 01:41:17,730
She watch this.

1287
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:19,810
Feng Shui, bitch.

1288
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:21,470
I leave.

1289
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:27,130
There we go.

1290
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:30,510
There we go.

1291
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:30,970
There we go.

1292
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:31,970
That's fine.

1293
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:33,770
I have this.

1294
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:38,150
I don't want to be a part of the problem.

1295
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:41,990
I don't want to be like, is the Hawkeye's 20th kill?

1296
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:42,790
Headshot?

1297
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:45,790
Oh, they're dead.

1298
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:46,870
No, they're- Oh my god!

1299
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:47,930
Why me!

1300
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:51,170
Oh shit, her, never mind.

1301
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:55,970
That's okay.

1302
01:41:59,150 --> 01:42:00,610
Um, sure, I'll be on the point.

1303
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:01,770
Who cares about my life?

1304
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:03,010
I'm just a little raccoon.

1305
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:07,810
There's no harm.

1306
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:08,590
Yeah, exactly.

1307
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:09,510
It's just chilling.

1308
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:12,590
They hit a checkpoint.

1309
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:15,050
Now might be a good time to stop them.

1310
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:17,410
You know what I think might be...

1311
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:17,830
I don't...

1312
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:20,030
I think maybe Widows just isn't it, maybe.

1313
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:21,890
But what do I know?

1314
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:22,790
I'm just a raccoon.

1315
01:42:24,690 --> 01:42:26,410
What do I know?

1316
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:27,890
I'm just a silly raccoon.

1317
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:31,510
But that's just a little... It's just a game theory.

1318
01:42:31,650 --> 01:42:32,310
It's just...

1319
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,390
It's just a theory.

1320
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:38,950
No, theories are meant to be tested.

1321
01:42:40,190 --> 01:42:42,210
What is this match?

1322
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:51,350
We have a Widow One Trick with Penny One Tricks.

1323
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:53,530
I'm just a silly...

1324
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:54,490
Little guy.

1325
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:56,410
Oh, hey, we won that fight.

1326
01:42:57,150 --> 01:42:58,130
How about support us?

1327
01:42:58,270 --> 01:42:59,030
Let's go.

1328
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:04,640
You just gotta test the theory out.

1329
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,200
See, there's also...

1330
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,060
Why do I have to play Raccoon?

1331
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:14,140
Because I don't have to look at my team to heal my team.

1332
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,140
I know, isn't that fucking wild?

1333
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:17,540
That should be illegal.

1334
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:18,420
Like...

1335
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:24,200
Like, as a support player, I feel like maybe you should be...

1336
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:56,040
to look but i don't have to i literally just i could look at a wall and i still heal someone might flank you stop speaking like that okay never mind i think it's gonna i don't think this is feng shui though i don't think i got the feng shui on that nope nope had a feeling i had a feeling we're not feng shuiing that

1337
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:06,200
I mean, to be fair, our tanks were, like, so far apart from each other.

1338
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:06,880
I don't know.

1339
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:09,820
Our Emma already has all again?

1340
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,740
Who's feeding him?

1341
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,820
Holy shit.

1342
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,260
I'm sorry, the Emma.

1343
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:17,380
Oh, my God.

1344
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:20,640
Bro, who the fuck is feeding this Emma?

1345
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:22,660
Like, who?

1346
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:23,300
Oh, my God.

1347
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:26,180
This Scarlet Witch is just playing Scarlet, just a DM.

1348
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:34,920
He has contributed nothing to the team, and he still is.

1349
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:41,900
There was no...

1350
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:42,860
Yeah, there was not.

1351
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:44,980
I had to just chuck it in there.

1352
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:46,440
We were all getting picked.

1353
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:49,920
Yay!

1354
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:58,920
No, I...

1355
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:01,920
I had a feeling this was...

1356
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:02,560
I don't know.

1357
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:03,620
They just...

1358
01:45:06,520 --> 01:46:22,460
I just think the widow we just needed a mantis but we just didn't have a mantis we just need a triple support but there was no way like if my team was dying so fast with uh with rocket luna my team was not gonna survive with luna mantis there was no way like it was literally like just been fucking uh we have just been like rodon oh yeah the emma with the 60k yeah yeah he was yeah i don't yeah wait that's not fair what the fuck how did their rocket get old so fucking fast when my emma was eating 60k worth the damage that's like crazy where was he bro my entire team was being farmed and damaged like holy oh my god 14k how are you allowed oh how you you live longer than my luna

1359
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:48,100
that's insane oh i guess because like my luna kept getting headshot by the hawk eye though to be fair okay now next game we play we play a natural support character and like die just like my luna there i won't play luna play invis invis is less uh you can try less and still do the same thing as luna

1360
01:46:51,390 --> 01:47:11,530
you can try jeff i'm not great at jeff i only started learning jeff last season i just don't know how to alt him use his all efficiently i need to learn better rocket alt placements and uh how to to play this character when he goes I just don't know.

1361
01:47:11,570 --> 01:47:11,970
Oh, shit.

1362
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:12,310
Sorry.

1363
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:12,830
Sorry.

1364
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:14,010
I didn't mean to.

1365
01:47:14,110 --> 01:47:15,890
I thought I was in the rank for some reason.

1366
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:19,170
Hello.

1367
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:21,790
You wouldn't hit.

1368
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:24,870
I didn't even fucking defend myself.

1369
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:25,390
Hello?

1370
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:28,350
You wouldn't hit someone that can't defend themselves.

1371
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:28,790
Oh, wait.

1372
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:29,970
No, he would, absolutely.

1373
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:31,190
No, he had eight kills.

1374
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:33,870
He was terrorizing the RIP lobbies.

1375
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:44,320
Also, like, to be fair, when I play on this time, I just don't think they shoot the rocket up.

1376
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:46,920
Because, like, it's 4 in the morning.

1377
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,380
Why are y'all...

1378
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:53,460
How do you have the attention span to shoot the rocket up together?

1379
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:54,880
Holy fuck.

1380
01:47:56,780 --> 01:48:00,940
Why have my team worked together to shoot the rocket up?

1381
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,800
That's crazy.

1382
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,540
They have the attention span for that.

1383
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:57,520
I'm sad I am not level 60 at 9 anymore all right I'm not the type who fades play invisible woman it's no longer right click simulator like how is your mind that active at this time I'm the I'm the last support player in demon hours apparently I feel like everyone else like is forced to flex and I'm like I'll play support I'm a support mate everyone and it's just me the last one standing in D-Gen hours

1384
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:07,940
alright what else are they banning the last one standing

1385
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:18,380
because the other support players have regular lives They love themselves more.

1386
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,740
Do I get a personal...

1387
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:26,060
If we lose, I blacklist you.

1388
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:28,380
If we...

1389
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:34,180
Right heroes could make all the difference.

1390
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:43,380
That's fucky, right?

1391
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:47,120
So you better... Oh wait, I was gonna say you better play support, but that's our Emma player.

1392
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:52,270
The last support coming to us in a near you.

1393
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:56,440
That's crazy.

1394
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:57,720
That's right.

1395
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:58,840
He's got...

1396
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:01,180
He's like, oh, fuck, I'll play support.

1397
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,020
Great shit.

1398
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:05,040
But we need Emma, bro.

1399
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,460
Round one.

1400
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,500
Look, now he'll try.

1401
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:14,840
Now he'll have to try.

1402
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:17,740
See, when...

1403
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,280
See, threatening people is not good.

1404
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:23,800
Unless...

1405
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:31,720
Unless you can win.

1406
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:39,990
Unless, yeah, unless it works.

1407
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:53,360
We just don't have an Emma now, which is...

1408
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,080
Oh, wait, we could like...

1409
01:50:55,080 --> 01:51:04,890
why the we're running namor why don't we oh my god i hope like the cloak is healing yeah okay that's good

01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:30,860

1412
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:35,080
See, I actually have to try.

1413
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:40,740
Oh, oh, I jumped when I didn't expect him to jump there.

1414
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:45,120
Oh guys, it's like I can aim.

1415
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,900
I just choose not to because there's too much work.

1416
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,140
I can't believe.

1417
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,420
Like I even have load already.

1418
01:51:58,700 --> 01:51:59,480
There we go.

1419
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:01,400
There we go.

1420
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:02,060
That's fine.

1421
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:07,400
Why aim when I can win by not aiming?

1422
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:09,620
Oh, nice.

1423
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:12,280
Yeah, he can look first.

1424
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:13,380
I just chill.

1425
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:14,840
Come on, do it.

1426
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,500
Come on, do it.

1427
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:16,320
Unless you're a pussy.

1428
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,040
Come on, do it.

1429
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:20,900
Yeah, don't be a fucking pussy.

1430
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:22,780
He's gonna die.

1431
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:23,800
Oh, no, he's alive.

1432
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:24,800
Good for him.

1433
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:27,480
We're fine.

1434
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:37,640
I know that Groot has oh, so I'm just gonna There you go, and then I just jump away Where am I?

1435
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:57,480
Okay, I got healed now though Because that magic the magic can technically one-shot so like I got scared I didn't want to get one shot Because it is possible Wait, what the fuck we're doing?

1436
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:58,260
Where did he go?

1437
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,560
Um, oh shit!

1438
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:04,140
That's fine.

1439
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,860
I don't want to waste my, uh, in this thing.

1440
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:11,020
Jesus.

1441
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:12,620
Oh, goodbye.

1442
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:13,280
Sorry, bro.

1443
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,160
Nothing I could do.

1444
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:18,660
That's fine.

1445
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:21,420
See, we're fine.

1446
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,980
Um, we lost our only tank, but we're fine.

1447
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:26,380
Oh, I...

1448
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:27,480
Oh my god.

1449
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,440
That fucking Groot Wall saved them.

1450
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,620
I need to make sure I have my shield.

1451
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,560
Because they are running that.

1452
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:36,540
Oh my god, that was so scary.

1453
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:37,760
And that too.

1454
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:41,140
That's the scary part.

1455
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:43,380
Because I have to make sure I have my...

1456
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:43,900
Jesus!

1457
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,560
Oh my god, I lost my peel!

1458
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,780
I lost my peel.

1459
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:56,080
I am ready to put on a show.

1460
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:59,440
Oh, haha, where am I?

1461
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:02,140
I have to pass the heal, but where am I?

1462
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:03,500
Okay, there we go.

1463
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:09,340
Oh shit, why did you- Why did you get out of the orb?

1464
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:13,360
That's so sad.

1465
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,980
I was so close to all two.

1466
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,380
I'm so sad.

1467
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,800
Oh my god.

1468
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:22,420
The namer got out of his thing, and it like fucked with me.

1469
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:25,160
Alright.

1470
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:58,060
yeah even in your alt the magic can one shot you that's why i don't want to be near my own alt when i'm when i hear magical i have to like basically alt it like very far away it's dumb but like that's how broken magic is oh my god i'm worried about getting headshot here so i'm just gonna oh oh all right That's unlucky.

1471
01:54:59,160 --> 01:54:59,920
I can't remember.

1472
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:01,960
Are you...

1473
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:02,400
Jesus.

1474
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:03,800
Why are you still here?

1475
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:05,500
Bro, okay.

1476
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,020
Oh, I missed that.

1477
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:10,920
That's unlucky.

1478
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:14,460
I mean, I think we can kill him.

1479
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:15,540
Technically, yeah, we can.

1480
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:16,180
If he doesn't...

1481
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:16,860
Nope, never mind.

1482
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:18,840
He had...

1483
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:19,520
He's a hero.

1484
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:21,020
America.

1485
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:26,020
Don't want to be too close.

1486
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:26,760
Why are we widow?

1487
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,560
It's widow hours at these hours.

1488
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:33,900
Oh, here you go.

1489
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:36,440
I'm okay that I'm here.

1490
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:44,680
I don't want to stand in front of the hot guy because we technically have one shield.

1491
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:47,860
Oh.

1492
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:50,080
Oh my god.

1493
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:50,500
I can't.

1494
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,040
My damage is not strong enough.

1495
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:53,180
I'm sorry.

1496
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:57,300
My damage is so weak against the Groot shield.

1497
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,100
There we go.

1498
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:07,020
See, moving isn't a choice.

1499
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:10,460
I have to keep moving, unfortunately.

1500
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:16,340
If I don't look at him, he can't headshot me.

1501
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:19,880
That's not true, but, like, it's called co-op.

1502
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:21,600
That's what...

1503
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,140
Oh my god!

1504
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:26,900
Emma, you know he has his accrued, bro!

1505
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:28,820
Oh my god!

1506
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,540
He's so dead.

1507
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:33,300
If our Daredevil lives, I...

1508
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,880
Oh my god, he's on...

1509
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,460
He's on life support.

1510
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,220
There's no way.

1511
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:38,100
This is...

1512
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:39,940
He's literally on life support right now.

1513
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,400
I was gonna say, there's no way he lives that.

1514
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:50,020
Okay.

1515
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:52,340
Bro, please.

1516
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:53,120
Please, Emma.

1517
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:54,440
Emma, please.

1518
01:56:57,860 --> 01:56:58,840
Oh, Mac!

1519
01:56:59,000 --> 01:56:59,140
Emma!

1520
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:04,260
Oh, this is so bad.

1521
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:05,960
This is so bad.

1522
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:11,100
These walls are actually crazy.

1523
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,900
These walls are so bad for us.

1524
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:21,340
Oh my god.

1525
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:27,320
We just keep getting walled off.

1526
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,120
And then our...

1527
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:30,040
Our...

1528
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:32,620
Our Emma keeps getting walled off for no reason.

1529
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:35,540
There's nothing we could do.

1530
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:37,720
Oh wait, we've swapped support players.

1531
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,000
Alright, maybe this time.

1532
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,180
We swapped support players.

1533
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:45,860
Maybe we got this.

1534
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:51,080
Maybe it is possible.

1535
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:54,080
Maybe this guy won't get walled off.

1536
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:58,840
Oh, we got the widow, the random widow Scarlet player.

1537
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,380
Why don't we get the fucking...

1538
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:05,120
Hawkeye player.

1539
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:06,880
How do we get the Skylip?

1540
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,660
The Widow player.

1541
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,400
Oh, that's fine.

1542
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:15,840
Holy shit.

1543
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:18,300
This building made my frame drop so much.

1544
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:20,840
Alright.

1545
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:22,240
Last fight.

1546
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:24,940
I mean, I have all for my last fight.

1547
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:26,900
Here we go.

1548
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:30,620
This one.

1549
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:43,520
Hope he doesn't actually see me Oh shit, oh shit That was scary

1550
01:58:46,940 --> 01:59:00,500
We kill that one dude So yeah, I have a push for this one moment My push didn't work Oh my god, he fucking ate him

1551
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:08,170
He actually ate the fucking matching all the time That's so sad.

1552
01:59:14,430 --> 01:59:15,070
Behold!

1553
01:59:15,870 --> 01:59:16,730
Behold what, bro?

1554
01:59:20,990 --> 01:59:22,230
That's so sad.

1555
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:25,390
That was actually so fucking sad.

1556
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:34,390
The stream swap back to take.

1557
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:35,850
He was like, oh shit.

1558
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:37,850
I'm gonna actually get blacklisted.

1559
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:43,530
I could lie and be like, hey...

1560
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:47,530
Uh...

1561
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:52,590
Hey, hey, if we win this, just give me, just give me your name, and then...

1562
01:59:53,130 --> 02:00:05,610
And then you'll get like special treatment From the maid cafe and then he gives... oh wait, but he's watching the stream But then like if he gives me the name and then we lose I know what name the blacklist

1563
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:10,920
I know

1564
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:28,740
what name that's evil hey if he wins he gets a special shout out at the maid cafe if he lose we know what your name

1565
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:46,000
jesus christ he's taking he's taking so much bro briggs he is actually struggling fighting for his life right now with the dps we have

1566
02:00:52,490 --> 02:01:06,970
like micro manage bro this like i have to like micro manage my shield so much this is the hard part about invis i feel like because you gotta make sure you don't waste your shield with dumb

1567
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:19,380
all right that's fine oh like so i can have the shield for that

1568
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:50,540

1569
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:52,180
but fuck that shit.

1570
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:54,360
I'm gaming.

1571
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:59,800
Bro is playing like his life depended on it.

1572
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:02,900
I didn't want our fucking widow to get one shot there.

1573
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,860
See, now I don't have the shield for it.

1574
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:07,660
Yeah.

1575
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:15,660
I'm a little scared only because...

1576
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:16,260
There we go.

1577
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:17,180
That's fucking right.

1578
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:17,800
Get in here.

1579
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,500
You thought you could leave this fight?

1580
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:23,600
You never, you can never leave.

1581
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:29,260
Our Luna is passively charging.

1582
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:37,140
To be fair, if I was a real player, I would, like, I would swap with her so she can build her Luna up if I was a real person.

1583
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:39,420
But I'm not, I'm anime.

1584
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:45,420
There you go.

1585
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:49,500
Oh, shit.

1586
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,200
There you go.

1587
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:56,960
We're five.

1588
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:00,540
Oh, we are not five.

1589
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:02,380
Luna, why didn't you charge her all?

1590
02:03:06,850 --> 02:03:09,230
Luna, if only you charged your all.

1591
02:03:09,570 --> 02:03:11,270
Why did you let me push up, Luna?

1592
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:16,150
We could have had her, we could have had her, Luna.

1593
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:18,190
Never my fault.

1594
02:03:18,610 --> 02:03:19,470
Not my problem.

1595
02:03:21,330 --> 02:03:21,950
This is on her.

1596
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:22,850
Oh shit, nice.

1597
02:03:22,950 --> 02:03:23,810
They double support all did.

1598
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:26,650
That's what I like to see.

1599
02:03:28,370 --> 02:03:30,350
Oh fuck, I should not have hit her.

1600
02:03:33,690 --> 02:03:36,370
The one with the cast is like...

1601
02:03:36,370 --> 02:03:37,950
What did I do, huh?

1602
02:03:40,990 --> 02:03:43,410
She should have fucking said something.

1603
02:03:44,490 --> 02:03:45,310
How is that my fault?

1604
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:46,310
She didn't say anything.

1605
02:03:49,890 --> 02:03:51,290
Yeah, I have to like reload too.

1606
02:03:54,370 --> 02:03:56,210
Like she has a mic!

1607
02:03:56,490 --> 02:03:58,350
She has free will!

1608
02:04:02,230 --> 02:04:04,290
It's never my fault.

1609
02:04:05,790 --> 02:04:07,270
It's never the streamer's fault.

1610
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:08,710
That's why we stream.

1611
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:11,190
No, yeah, exactly.

1612
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:12,390
Why didn't she comment?

1613
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:15,750
She could have been like, in this swap with me.

1614
02:04:17,970 --> 02:04:19,090
That's on her.

1615
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:23,730
Vortex field!

1616
02:04:30,210 --> 02:04:30,890
All right.

1617
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:36,780
All right, we have...

1618
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:39,360
We do have Luna out here.

1619
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,320
That's right, get back in the fight!

1620
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:43,820
Oh, nice, we win.

1621
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:45,940
Let's go!

1622
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,400
It might have been, like, overkill.

1623
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,620
I know, thank you for the red.

1624
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:56,820
Thank you, thank you!

1625
02:04:56,980 --> 02:04:58,040
We had a good stream!

1626
02:04:59,120 --> 02:04:59,460
Yeah!

1627
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:03,960
Cafe, here I come.

1628
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:10,420
See, guys, sometimes it's okay to threaten someone.

1629
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:12,260
In-game, because it was in-game.

1630
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:13,720
In-game, in-game.

1631
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:14,500
Because it works.

1632
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,880
If it works, sometimes it's okay.

1633
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:23,960
Look, I wouldn't, wouldn't, he tried.

1634
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:26,520
He tried at 4 in the morning.

1635
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,220
If it works, he tried.

1636
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:32,720
Might as well.

1637
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:37,260
Here we see the benefits of threatening people in game.

1638
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:46,600
Look at that.

1639
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:48,120
Plus 22.

1640
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,840
Sometimes it just works.

1641
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:56,060
Oh yeah.

1642
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:58,760
Please feel free to nominate.

1643
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,000
Not sorry.

1644
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:00,640
I'm booking.

1645
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:02,340
It is 4 in the morning.

1646
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:03,800
But yeah.

1647
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:04,600
Please feel free to nominate.

1648
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:14,080
nominate me for best Marvel Rival streamer because I am definitely a role model to all players out there.

1649
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:18,300
I am definitely the role model to represent all of you in this category.

1650
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:27,950
And after seeing you throw in that man, I would definitely nominate.

1651
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:32,610
Honestly, that is peak Marvel Rival's behavior, though, guys.

1652
02:06:33,310 --> 02:06:34,170
You can't lie.

1653
02:06:35,110 --> 02:06:38,750
If anything, that is that is what you should expect.

1654
02:06:38,770 --> 02:07:10,200
when you when you meet a Marvel rivals player like if anything I'm just not seeing gamer words if anything I'm not as authentic because I'm not seeing any gamer words yeah a win or a hold this match I'm surprised it's surprising like How well that actually...

1655
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:12,940
How many times that has actually worked in the lobby?

1656
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:17,640
Hello, Angela.

1657
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:21,160
Would you like a little dance?

1658
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:21,980
Whoa!

1659
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:24,500
That's wrong!

1660
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:27,400
Guys, I don't think she wants this dance.

1661
02:07:28,660 --> 02:07:29,580
Hello, everyone.

1662
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,400
Would you like a little dance?

1663
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:34,300
Okay, apparently...

1664
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,220
Apparently they don't.

1665
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:38,760
Jesus.

1666
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:43,260
Mantis has returned.

1667
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:52,360
No, I 100% believe that the Marvel Rivals player base is very toxic.

1668
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:54,680
No.

1669
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:56,400
It's pretty bad.

1670
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:58,140
It's not as bad as League.

1671
02:07:58,700 --> 02:08:00,340
Not as bad as League.

1672
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:03,560
Because like, that's surprising.

1673
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:20,160
It's surprising that League is the most toxic game in the world and they don't even have voice chat i think that's the craziest part they don't need voice chat to be toxic and the fact that like every fucking word is filtered in that game

1674
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:27,620
text exactly text is enough to convey

1675
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:34,820
we learned some some interesting like

1676
02:08:37,880 --> 02:09:16,180
because i asked in the previous stream for those who didn't know I Look I did I played my invisible one invisible woman game I told you I will play like a real character and I did and we won Like I can't play real characters Um But for those who didn't know Um I asked my chat what is like some of the most creative things They've read in a leak chat Um when they're feeling extra spicy That day Um I think I think my favorite one jump that's all that's it just jump

1677
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:33,260
they can't ban you for that what if you're telling them to jump to this lane you know like oh jump to lane a you know yeah jump

1678
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:48,160
also keep yourself safe that one's good whoever invented that you know they They had a really rough game.

1679
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:54,880
I feel like Keep Yourself Safe was inspired by a really fucked up game.

1680
02:09:55,520 --> 02:10:06,500
It was so bad that they had to invent the best insult I've ever heard.

1681
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:16,780
I learned that from League.

1682
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:18,320
I don't play League.

1683
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:24,040
Not like my friends who plays league taught me that.

1684
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:31,220
But sometimes we take stuff other people are guarding.

1685
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:43,640
A former friend got banned for the acronym and was dumb enough to message support and say, I'm from Alabama and that sound that means kiss your sister.

1686
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:50,220
That's why you say the full thing.

1687
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:55,000
It's your sister.

1688
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:56,860
Why was I bad?

1689
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:02,200
Four, three, two, one.

1690
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:07,860
You need to stop that vehicle in its tracks.

1691
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:10,540
Oh, no.

1692
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:11,600
It's Spider-Man.

1693
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:17,660
Wait, can we even do, um, can we even do, like, Animal Crossing comp?

1694
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:20,560
For those who don't know what Animal Crossing comp is, literally, Jeff and Rocket.

1695
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:24,140
But they asked, oh, wait, we do have Animal Crossing.

1696
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:25,160
Let's go!

1697
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:25,860
That's Spider-Man.

1698
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:28,140
Spider-Man ain't doing anything now.

1699
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:31,660
If our venom dies, like, no God can save him.

1700
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:34,600
Like, he was meant to die in this world.

1701
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:36,320
Because you're...

1702
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:38,640
The amount of...

1703
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:38,840
Oh!

1704
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:40,460
Goodbye.

1705
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:43,080
No, now our venom will definitely die.

1706
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:48,120
Okay, I just need them to know that, like, I am doing everything I can to heal them.

1707
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:50,260
Oh, my God.

1708
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:51,660
They're full fucking dive.

1709
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:53,140
That is terrible.

1710
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:54,580
That is absolutely terrible.

1711
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:57,700
They're actually, oh my god.

1712
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,500
That is not fun.

1713
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:00,900
Never mind.

1714
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:05,420
See, this is not fun for our Luna, that's for sure.

1715
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:07,880
I just have to play, like, more...

1716
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:09,880
More, like...

1717
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:10,480
What's the word?

1718
02:12:11,380 --> 02:12:15,140
I have to play more, like, all over the place, like, the climb.

1719
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:16,580
Whoa.

1720
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:21,140
Hello, Jeff.

1721
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:22,180
I am here for you.

1722
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:22,820
Don't worry.

1723
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:28,190
Whoops.

1724
02:12:29,370 --> 02:12:32,630
I mean, I'm trying to keep my Luna alive.

1725
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:36,070
There's nothing I can do.

1726
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:42,270
There was literally nothing I can do.

1727
02:12:44,110 --> 02:12:44,750
That sucks.

1728
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:46,790
This is rough.

1729
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:48,950
They're running full fucking bad.

1730
02:12:49,710 --> 02:12:52,330
They're only missing like venom, honestly.

1731
02:12:53,550 --> 02:12:56,050
I don't even know we...

1732
02:12:57,370 --> 02:12:59,770
Aww, goodbye.

1733
02:13:02,270 --> 02:13:03,570
I don't know.

1734
02:13:04,010 --> 02:13:07,550
I think the only way to win this is if our team turns around.

1735
02:13:08,650 --> 02:13:17,570
And unfortunately, my team, other than me and my support, we have yet to turn around.

1736
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:22,230
So that is very unfortunate.

1737
02:13:23,050 --> 02:13:25,870
Like, it's really we gotta do one thing.

1738
02:13:26,970 --> 02:13:27,710
Goodbye.

1739
02:13:27,730 --> 02:13:29,650
Oh shit.

1740
02:13:30,630 --> 02:13:32,730
Oh shit.

1741
02:13:36,730 --> 02:13:38,610
I told you.

1742
02:13:39,470 --> 02:13:41,070
They're all just like crazy.

1743
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:42,470
What do I do?

1744
02:13:44,890 --> 02:13:47,450
What can you do?

1745
02:13:49,210 --> 02:13:54,770
Bro, I literally, I was in the middle of our Luna ult, but fuck me, I guess.

1746
02:13:57,730 --> 02:13:59,990
That's why I fucking, I hate...

1747
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:02,650
Yeah, no, I hate the magic of...

1748
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:06,550
Because literally it can one-shot any support of, like, as you guys saw.

1749
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:08,550
As you guys saw.

1750
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:09,290
There you go.

1751
02:14:09,370 --> 02:14:10,850
Maybe our Bucky will turn around.

1752
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:12,710
Oh, goodbye.

1753
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:15,530
That's all we need.

1754
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:17,170
Oh, goodbye.

1755
02:14:21,130 --> 02:14:21,650
Um...

1756
02:14:22,290 --> 02:14:25,810
I think our Angela can live for all of us, right?

1757
02:14:26,670 --> 02:14:27,190
Yeah.

1758
02:14:27,730 --> 02:14:31,330
We're solo tank Angela, but this is a little hard.

1759
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:34,910
Oh, nice.

1760
02:14:35,090 --> 02:14:35,510
Nice up.

1761
02:14:35,690 --> 02:14:36,130
Nice up.

1762
02:14:36,730 --> 02:14:37,270
All right.

1763
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:39,750
Let's hope that does something.

1764
02:14:41,050 --> 02:14:41,110
All right.

1765
02:14:41,170 --> 02:14:43,070
My ult's going to die here, but that's okay.

1766
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:46,610
What?

1767
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:48,130
I didn't...

1768
02:14:48,130 --> 02:14:49,910
It killed through the...

1769
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:50,850
Oh, shit.

1770
02:14:54,290 --> 02:14:55,930
It killed through the invisible.

1771
02:14:56,830 --> 02:14:57,670
They're out of here.

1772
02:14:57,730 --> 02:15:31,110
grabbed me there was nothing I could do there was something we could do I mean it's like at the door so it's not like the most ideal placement but it definitely is not very ideal for me because I Can't really do anything right now.

1773
02:15:32,110 --> 02:15:34,530
But I can't shoot him in.

1774
02:15:34,690 --> 02:15:36,610
Oh my god, what is he doing here?

1775
02:15:45,270 --> 02:15:48,230
What the fuck is he doing over there?

1776
02:15:48,470 --> 02:15:50,090
Oh, I'm not gonna make it easy.

1777
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:51,350
Guys, this does not look ideal.

1778
02:15:52,870 --> 02:15:54,250
This looks very rough.

1779
02:15:54,330 --> 02:15:54,770
Can you go tank?

1780
02:15:55,870 --> 02:15:56,290
This range.

1781
02:15:57,730 --> 02:15:58,610
I'm touching.

1782
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:01,270
Oh, we're not TPing.

1783
02:16:01,990 --> 02:16:02,710
Oh, okay.

1784
02:16:04,410 --> 02:16:05,930
I mean, he touched it.

1785
02:16:10,290 --> 02:16:11,510
Very unfortunate.

1786
02:16:11,930 --> 02:16:14,870
I did not expect him to fucking show up.

1787
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:16,250
I found one of our critics.

1788
02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:17,710
Armor patch here!

1789
02:16:19,490 --> 02:16:20,130
Um...

1790
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,990
Hmm...

1791
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:22,810
Hmm...

1792
02:16:23,630 --> 02:16:27,470
You see, I am very limited on what I can do.

1793
02:16:31,710 --> 02:16:38,150
Very unfortunately that He's fucking still Oh my god Where's the Spider-Man?

1794
02:16:38,590 --> 02:16:40,710
You fucking freak Why are you there?

1795
02:16:42,030 --> 02:16:56,830
You goddamn freak Oh hey I'm back Hello I mean it was nice for them to Oh my god Oh my god Goodbye What are they all doing?

1796
02:16:59,730 --> 02:17:19,750
I go from one way there's enemies wherever I go there's nowhere I can live they actually they're everywhere they're everywhere they're double agents everywhere and they're actually there like where do I go

1797
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:32,900
He's gonna destroy us, so you do something before he does.

1798
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,420
There's like nothing else.

1799
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:37,840
Do something before he kills it.

1800
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:43,900
There we go.

1801
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:45,840
I don't think he sees me.

1802
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:46,860
He doesn't see me.

1803
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:49,840
We just gotta live two more fights.

1804
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:52,860
Everywhere you go, I see them.

1805
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:57,040
I gotta put this out of here.

1806
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:00,020
I swear to God, the Spider-Man, fucking I swear to God.

1807
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:02,180
There's like nowhere I can put my res.

1808
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:08,800
I know that me putting my res there, it's just gonna get destroyed by the spam.

1809
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:10,540
He's just gonna be, like, right behind you.

1810
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:14,300
Goodbye, Strange.

1811
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:16,160
Unless...

1812
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:17,240
Oh, no, he fucked up.

1813
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:18,820
He went through the wrong hole.

1814
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:19,840
Goodbye, Strange.

1815
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:21,460
It's okay, I have a res.

1816
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:23,020
I think he makes it.

1817
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:25,420
Yeah, he does.

1818
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:27,440
Oh, yeah, no, he has all.

1819
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:32,810
Hey, guys.

1820
02:18:34,430 --> 02:18:34,910

I'm okay

1825
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:59,980
Everything's fine Jesus Christ.

02:19:00,140 --> 02:19:01,220
Okay, that's on our strange.

Oh, they TP'd?

1844
02:22:01,080 --> 02:22:03,460
But they TP'd so far away from us.

1845
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:05,060
That's crazy.

1846
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:06,880
Wait, I love it!

1847
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:11,940
Bye, Luna.

1848
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:13,100
I got solid.

1849
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:15,460
It's okay.

1850
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:19,260
I mean, it's not okay for her, but it's okay for me.

1851
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:21,940
What?

1852
02:22:25,460 --> 02:22:26,660
Oh, does he get that?

1853
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:27,640
I just threw that out.

1854
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:29,420
No, he does not.

1855
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:31,600
I literally just threw that out, too.

1856
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:32,660
That sucks for him.

1857
02:22:34,580 --> 02:22:35,840
Oh, wait, that's crazy.

1858
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:36,660
That's good.

1859
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:37,900
That's insane, chat.

1860
02:22:38,020 --> 02:22:38,460
Goodbye.

1861
02:22:39,900 --> 02:22:40,560
Never mind.

1862
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:41,780
That sucks.

1863
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,280
That would have been such a good.

1864
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:43,800
Oh.

1865
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:47,740
Oh, goodbye.

1866
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:49,180
Yeah, I don't think...

1867
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:50,320
I don't think...

1868
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:51,140
Oh, wait!

1869
02:22:51,140 --> 02:22:52,200
He got it!

1870
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:55,220
There we go.

1871
02:22:56,380 --> 02:22:56,700
Oh.

1872
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:58,300
Catch the orb!

1873
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:00,440
Oh, wait.

1874
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:00,860
Nice.

1875
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:02,000
Oh, not nice.

1876
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:02,440
Hey, guys.

1877
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:04,160
There's a strange up there.

1878
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:05,620
Like...

1879
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:07,340
Just one guy.

1880
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:09,420
Maybe he'll gain from me.

1881
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:23,840
Oh, okay, I thought he'll kill the I I legitimately thought that he would kill My team would kill the others before they kill me, but that's okay That's silly of me to think that

1882
02:23:27,580 --> 02:23:36,860
Don't worry, I got the res Are we still pushing who the fuck is one spider-man?

1883
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:41,700
Bro fucking kill a pig Peter Parker, we've done it before.

1884
02:23:42,320 --> 02:23:43,560
We can do it again.

1885
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:47,520
He's died, like, how many times?

1886
02:23:50,460 --> 02:23:52,200
Get that Spider-Man.

1887
02:23:54,300 --> 02:23:55,580
So, thank you for Twitch Prime.

1888
02:23:55,820 --> 02:23:56,660
Thank you, thank you.

1889
02:23:58,480 --> 02:24:01,680
We can do it again.

1890
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:05,820
We'll make sure every multiverse of Peter Parker dies.

1891
02:24:07,100 --> 02:24:09,080
But just Peter Parker, the others can live.

1892
02:24:15,280 --> 02:25:06,860
I want to use my aura here but oh wait like right here I had a feeling goodbye everyone unless ha ha ha we lost my rocket alt though we lost two how did we lose two oh gosh shit i mean he wasted it all like it was they already won the fight every peter must die like do we really need peter parker we literally have like 20 other like two like there's a multiverse for a reason if anything gwen stacy is a better peter parker than peter parker that's right i said it

1893
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:10,520
Alright.

1894
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:15,220
You take that back!

1895
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:18,780
Okay, that's just false.

1896
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:25,160
Okay, but she is the hotter, hotter Peter Parker.

1897
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:30,840
Yeah, preach.

1898
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:32,820
Peter is hot.

1899
02:25:33,020 --> 02:25:34,040
I said hotter!

1900
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:41,460
I am ready to put on a show.

1901
02:25:42,020 --> 02:25:43,700
That's all so false.

1902
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:44,480
They're stuck.

1903
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:45,860
Holy, yep.

1904
02:25:46,220 --> 02:25:47,100
That'll waste it.

1905
02:25:51,420 --> 02:25:54,920
The worst thing said on Twitch ever.

1906
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:57,840
All right, what makes Peter hotter than Gwen?

1907
02:25:58,380 --> 02:26:00,760
Gwen's Peter part, Gwen's Spider-Man.

1908
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:04,020
No, no, please enlighten me.

1909
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:05,440
Give me the pros and cons.

1910
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:09,060
This has to be written.

1911
02:26:09,100 --> 02:26:26,500
No, I'm talking about like, like it's broke this also yes Gwen is also richer than Peter Parker you think about it he's literally me he's your self-insert how can I self-insert myself if Peter Parker's dead you're so right

1912
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:40,820
I'm gonna get one shot in that all it does oh I'm absolutely gonna get one shot in that all that's not fair it's not fair

1913
02:26:44,980 --> 02:26:47,080
I heard the rocket on it.

1914
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:48,340
I was like, there's no living.

1915
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:49,920
You can't live.

1916
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:51,340
Live with that.

1917
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:52,360
I'm only this.

1918
02:26:52,980 --> 02:26:53,800
All right, it's fine.

1919
02:26:54,300 --> 02:26:54,600
Watch this.

1920
02:26:56,840 --> 02:26:58,640
I threw it incorrectly.

1921
02:26:59,220 --> 02:27:00,000
I threw it too far.

1922
02:27:00,060 --> 02:27:00,900
They don't need to know that.

1923
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:05,220
I threw by... Okay, it's fine.

1924
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:06,380
We won the fight.

1925
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:07,660
It doesn't matter.

1926
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:09,320
We won the fight.

1927
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:11,260
I might have thrown that ult.

1928
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:34,780
wildly but like it worked in the end okay and I have res too okay we lost a tank but it's okay I still have res okay we lost you Jesus Christ just fuck me Yaka's all right it's okay

1929
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:47,420
all right it's okay I may or may not have thrown that by randomly chucking my all on the ground.

1930
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:53,040
That was not the smartest thing I've done today.

1931
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:57,260
At least I didn't do what he did.

1932
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:02,380
Okay, yeah, this is not a winnable fight.

1933
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:03,940
Oh, shit!

1934
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:06,860
Look, I am doing my best.

1935
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:07,720
Okay, we're...

1936
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:08,640
Wait, we're up.

1937
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:10,640
We're technically up.

1938
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:11,120
One.

1939
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:13,800
Jesus Christ.

1940
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:14,980
I'm gonna have a look.

1941
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:17,520
And we gotta up this.

1942
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:18,740
I'm gonna up this right now.

1943
02:28:18,980 --> 02:28:19,800
The moment I get my luck.

1944
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:22,640
Alright, let's go.

1945
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:23,100
I'm hoping.

1946
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,260
There we go.

1947
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:28,660
There we go.

1948
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:30,060
There we go.

1949
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:31,800
There we go.

1950
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:32,360
We won.

1951
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:34,380
We used... where else?

1952
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:36,740
But we have support up.

1953
02:28:38,420 --> 02:28:39,380
I leave.

1954
02:28:40,140 --> 02:28:41,020
Get the magic open.

1955
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:43,520
I leave.

1956
02:28:46,780 --> 02:28:49,540
I don't want to be in there.

1957
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:54,680
I don't want to be in there.

1958
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:58,260
Oh my god.

1959
02:28:58,340 --> 02:29:01,360
Oh my yeah, I was not living that.

1960
02:29:03,420 --> 02:29:04,260
It's okay.

1961
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:05,080
It's okay.

1962
02:29:05,580 --> 02:29:06,540
Our Luna's back.

1963
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:11,320
Oh my god, she is not okay though.

1964
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:12,920
It's okay.

1965
02:29:13,180 --> 02:29:13,720
I chucked it.

1966
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:15,820
That's gonna get to somebody, right?

1967
02:29:17,320 --> 02:29:18,240
Oh, no.

1968
02:29:18,740 --> 02:29:22,460

I go 50.

1971
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:40,720
Yeah Unfortunately the magic was allowed to do that

1972
02:29:49,660 --> 02:29:50,680
It's okay.

1973
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:52,420
It's okay.

1974
02:29:53,260 --> 02:29:59,500

They have like...

2033
02:37:34,850 --> 02:37:37,730
Because I feel like so many people control on these forums.

2034
02:37:38,590 --> 02:37:40,190
Um, on the prayer wall.

2035
02:37:43,250 --> 02:37:43,750
Uh...

2036
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:45,990
I feel like...

2037
02:37:45,990 --> 02:37:46,730
I feel like...

2038
02:37:46,730 --> 02:37:50,010
So I feel like they have like actual mods to...

2039
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:50,910
Um...

2040
02:37:51,450 --> 02:37:55,330
They have mods to like screen the commons.

2041
02:37:56,310 --> 02:38:04,570
like it's pre-screen do not raid this mad site I don't want to get in trouble I don't want to get in trouble he has 9.9 million people following him

2042
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:16,270
he has 9.9 million I'm scared of that that's like more that's like an entire country right there

2043
02:38:22,270 --> 02:38:32,110
I am worried about the fucking mad oh goodbye daredevil I am worried about that mad No, because I don't really have Um

2044
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:52,920
I turned I turned around for one second Like we ain't living that Oh Where the fuck did this I fucking went out of Invis just for him

2045
02:38:57,440 --> 02:39:05,700
The worst part Is we don't have a mag to kill them So We can take them I don't think we can take them.

2046
02:39:05,940 --> 02:39:10,420
I don't think we can take them.

2047
02:39:14,160 --> 02:39:18,320
Bro, like, we are sort of fucking blocked here.

2048
02:39:18,920 --> 02:39:22,280
This is very unfortunate.

2049
02:39:22,700 --> 02:39:23,260
No one's available.

2050
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:25,440
I'm a support.

2051
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:27,700
Oh shit.

2052
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:30,460
Oh shit, he died so fast.

2053
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:32,780
Hey guys, I'm a little worried.

2054
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:38,300
All right, we can finally hide back.

2055
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:40,320
I had to...

2056
02:39:40,320 --> 02:39:41,580
I think I actually might have to play Rocket.

2057
02:39:42,760 --> 02:39:44,920
I just figured, like, you know, I played a lot of Rocket.

2058
02:39:48,040 --> 02:39:49,500
I just think he...

2059
02:39:51,100 --> 02:39:53,400
I don't think he could clap hard.

2060
02:39:54,540 --> 02:39:54,920
Okay.

2061
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:58,700
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

2062
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:00,960
They buffed...

2063
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:02,180
They buffed the...

2064
02:40:02,180 --> 02:40:03,500
I knew...

2065
02:40:05,500 --> 02:40:07,660
Oh, it's bad idea.

2066
02:40:07,900 --> 02:40:09,900
Bro, like, we clapped at everything.

2067
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:12,200
Yeah, I think my shield had to be closer.

2068
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:12,940
Maybe.

2069
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:17,480
Maybe my shield was just a little bit closer.

2070
02:40:18,740 --> 02:40:21,140
Just a little bit.

2071
02:40:23,860 --> 02:40:24,420
Nice.

2072
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:27,040
There we go.

2073
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:32,140
Maybe he'll up first.

2074
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:33,180
You know?

2075
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:35,480
Oh, we did not need.

2076
02:40:35,500 --> 02:41:31,360
that that's for sure i mean that guy particular though yeah fuck him no worries i've got your back force first yeah we definitely did not need i'm a little worried here because we do have a widow and a magic and like anything that can like fuck me up oh there it is he's gonna use this all first right where was he going where was he going where was he going i'm i'm legitimately so i i'm so confused like he was he was really just traveling around the world with that all i'm like like,

2077
02:41:31,900 --> 02:41:31,900
okay.

2078
02:41:33,320 --> 02:41:35,460
I don't know where he was going.

2079
02:41:38,380 --> 02:41:38,380
Dang.

2080
02:41:39,220 --> 02:41:40,860
I was so confused.

2081
02:41:41,300 --> 02:41:42,080
Where is our tank?

2082
02:41:42,940 --> 02:41:44,200
Wait, where is our Emma?

2083
02:41:44,680 --> 02:41:44,920
Also.

2084
02:41:46,260 --> 02:41:48,300
Oh, he died so late.

2085
02:41:51,320 --> 02:41:55,680
Come on, we just got... Okay, let's...

2086
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:58,780
Alright, let's hope I... I'm... I'm blinded.

2087
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:06,200
Aw, it's because he used this, it's aww.

2088
02:42:07,600 --> 02:42:09,060
It's the amplifier.

2089
02:42:09,620 --> 02:42:12,080
The amplifier actually, fuck this.

2090
02:42:12,820 --> 02:42:15,300
The amplifier actually saved them.

2091
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:22,380
Um, I had no jump and also, like, there was no jump and also I got blinded.

2092
02:42:22,460 --> 02:42:24,460
So I was just fucking hoping my shield.

2093
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:30,060
Alright, it's time.

2094
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:30,680
I'm done.

2095
02:42:31,180 --> 02:42:34,000
We're gonna die from siloed up, but I'm done.

2096
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:37,380
I'm not dealing with this.

2097
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:42,180
This is the only way I can live.

2098
02:42:42,820 --> 02:42:45,840
I think most likely our Luna will die to siloed up.

2099
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:49,300
Unless we all somehow stack together.

2100
02:42:49,700 --> 02:42:51,180
Oh, it's okay.

2101
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:52,300
I have res.

2102
02:42:53,380 --> 02:42:56,720
It's like nothing bad happened to our Emma.

2103
02:42:57,400 --> 02:42:58,780
He gets the restart.

2104
02:42:59,560 --> 02:42:59,880
Oh.

2105
02:43:01,180 --> 02:43:02,420
think we're winning.

2106
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:07,320
Oh, unless Rigsie just kills everyone!

2107
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:08,200
Let's go!

2108
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:11,100
We delay our death for another year.

2109
02:43:18,390 --> 02:43:19,070
Yippee!

2110
02:43:21,470 --> 02:43:23,890
Rigsie delays the inevil for us.

2111
02:43:23,970 --> 02:43:24,530
Let's go.

2112
02:43:28,390 --> 02:43:29,070
Yippee!

2113
02:43:32,790 --> 02:43:35,030
Until... And then there... And then their...

2114
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:58,890
And then their sidewalk's gonna ult us and then and then we all die it's like a repeat oh what what if i just i had a few why did i do no run okay here you go oh that's fine that's fine um okay

2115
02:44:02,110 --> 02:44:06,570
i okay now we have no No support, though.

2116
02:44:08,970 --> 02:44:11,970
Um, um, I don't know.

2117
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:15,690
I think it's weird that our Luna ran away.

2118
02:44:17,430 --> 02:44:19,010
But, what can I do?

2119
02:44:19,010 --> 02:44:20,010
There's nothing I can do.

2120
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:23,070
It's okay.

2121
02:44:23,350 --> 02:44:24,370
It's not okay.

2122
02:44:25,050 --> 02:44:25,590
But it's okay.

2123
02:44:25,610 --> 02:44:27,010
Oh, we don't have a tank now.

2124
02:44:30,910 --> 02:44:31,590
It's okay.

2125
02:44:31,850 --> 02:44:32,670
Rixie can do this.

2126
02:44:32,990 --> 02:44:33,730
He can win.

2127
02:44:33,830 --> 02:44:34,730
He is our tank.

2128
02:44:34,730 --> 02:45:21,350
if we give enough heals on him he's practically a tank see look at that he's a oh he's technically a tank at that point we gotta give him enough heals you can technically have 700 hp and we never stop healing him all right so the other guys swap the tanks i think we we definitely needed the mags the entire time because they had a fucking uh i don't like how we're all grouped here like it only takes one it takes one fucking uh widow ult or or uh silo ult but like that widow is just for some reason looking at me i don't know why

2129
02:45:24,540 --> 02:45:37,560
the is our way like the fuck is he doing what the fuck was that widow doing like crazy man Man, that bro is crazy.

2130
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:42,640
Or even is my res.

2131
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:44,740
Are they gonna TP?

2132
02:45:44,980 --> 02:45:45,460
They should.

2133
02:45:50,270 --> 02:45:54,470
There's no way they see this res like right in front of all of us, right?

2134
02:45:54,570 --> 02:45:55,910
Actually, maybe I should.

2135
02:45:56,950 --> 02:46:00,010
Maybe it'd be better if I don't just put it in the open.

2136
02:46:01,770 --> 02:46:02,650
Oh, nice.

2137
02:46:03,010 --> 02:46:04,170
Oh, they cancel the TP.

2138
02:46:04,170 --> 02:46:35,530
Current score is Zero Two Die Widow I know it's insane Time to switch I like how they typed it right out We're like Yeah no shit There's no TP No fucking a raccoon They need a top notch team To win this one No fucking shit bro Now we win I don't know It's better to not have hope So things can surprise us Oh,

2139
02:46:35,810 --> 02:46:36,890
she cancelled it?

2140
02:46:50,270 --> 02:46:52,750
Okay, but did she really though?

2141
02:46:53,490 --> 02:46:54,630
Or is she lying?

2142
02:46:55,310 --> 02:46:58,070
I could easily be like, no, I cancelled it.

2143
02:47:02,670 --> 02:47:06,730
Look, I try to play Invis.

2144
02:47:07,290 --> 02:47:08,970
It's so strange to be back.

2145
02:47:08,990 --> 02:47:11,150
It just wasn't worth it.

2146
02:47:14,230 --> 02:47:15,450
It's just...

2147
02:47:15,450 --> 02:47:19,950
Why play Invis when I can do the same thing with less effort?

2148
02:47:26,820 --> 02:47:30,480
4, 3, 2, 1.

2149
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:35,080
Alright, here you go.

2150
02:47:37,180 --> 02:47:50,400
Also, we have, like, the thing is, we have one tank, so Invis doesn't do fucking If we had like two tanks, Invis would be better just for the fact that building alts would be a lot easier too.

2151
02:47:52,540 --> 02:47:54,580
And like, I can't play cloak.

2152
02:47:54,700 --> 02:47:56,820
Oh, I technically I can play cloak.

2153
02:47:57,340 --> 02:47:57,720
Whoa!

2154
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:02,240
But then I can't do like the heals efficiently against.

2155
02:48:03,280 --> 02:48:04,880
I'm not gonna try it, cloak.

2156
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:07,320
But I feel like that's just rocket with...

2157
02:48:08,360 --> 02:48:11,260
That's just technically rocket with hands.

2158
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:12,560
nice

2159
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:48,080
yeah i feel like cloak is just like another another rocket i guess can do damage jesus christ i wasn't paying attention another one yes holy shit rixie's living in there by one hp he's alive good for him he's actually i have to avoid this widow he is like not contributing to society and they're gonna kill me isn't he

2160
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:52,220
all right nice

2161
02:48:56,600 --> 02:49:24,440
whoa what the how is this widow still bro is he gonna kill our support holy why is he allowed to do that that's very unfortunate honestly I didn't think they just let it just let her walk up to her support That's very unfortunate.

2162
02:49:25,420 --> 02:49:36,440
All right Me first Okay, maybe If we stack I live if we stack I live do not stand on that point

2163
02:49:39,700 --> 02:49:44,080
Oh, wait, he killed my oh nice.

2164
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:46,480
It was just close enough.

2165
02:49:51,080 --> 02:49:51,880
Don't worry, I got you.

2166
02:49:54,980 --> 02:49:56,180
There you go.

2167
02:49:56,740 --> 02:49:57,600
Oh, that's unfortunate.

2168
02:49:57,840 --> 02:49:59,300
I was DPSing.

2169
02:50:00,300 --> 02:50:01,580
Don't you hate it?

2170
02:50:02,600 --> 02:50:05,780
I should have used that earlier.

2171
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:11,180
Alright, that's fine.

2172
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:13,880
I can just say...

2173
02:50:13,880 --> 02:50:14,020
Oh!

2174
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:15,740
What is he gonna do?

2175
02:50:15,940 --> 02:50:16,480
Follow me?

2176
02:50:19,400 --> 02:50:19,900
Burr.

2177
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:23,240
Oh, we're down, too.

2178
02:50:25,480 --> 02:50:27,920
Yeah, they res too, so we're technically down one.

2179
02:50:28,940 --> 02:50:29,460
Oh, shit.

2180
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:31,300
That's not good.

2181
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:33,260
Bye, everyone.

2182
02:50:35,820 --> 02:50:37,060
I'm gonna break my...

2183
02:50:37,060 --> 02:50:38,100
Oh, they broke my res.

2184
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:38,560
Oh, wait.

2185
02:50:38,860 --> 02:50:39,960
Our Punisher got res.

2186
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:45,000
I didn't even realize my Punisher got res.

2187
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:46,720
Those guys are about to shoot at us.

2188
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:48,480
Thank you.

2189
02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:52,540
I know the most exciting support player- that support character you can play.

2190
02:50:56,240 --> 02:50:58,340
Truly is so exciting.

2191
02:51:00,060 --> 02:51:15,900
I haven't- I was gonna try and play like- I mean the only other character you can play for this man- this- or against them is literally- I guess it's just- because like Scylok- Jesus Christ Scylok is- Are you fucking kidding me?

2192
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:19,760
I don't know, I'm sorry.

2193
02:51:20,300 --> 02:51:21,220
Bro, at least kill him.

2194
02:51:21,220 --> 02:51:21,840
At least kill him.

2195
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:22,200
Please.

2196
02:51:23,300 --> 02:51:23,640
Please.

2197
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:26,600
Please, for the love of God, just kill the fucking widow.

2198
02:51:27,220 --> 02:51:28,800
He's barely alive.

2199
02:51:28,960 --> 02:51:29,560
Okay, there you go.

2200
02:51:31,280 --> 02:51:31,280
Nice.

2201
02:51:31,820 --> 02:51:33,780
We can passively push the coin, I guess.

2202
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:38,860
There's no...

2203
02:51:39,420 --> 02:51:43,920
Oh, now they went mad when I wanted to play.

2204
02:51:44,200 --> 02:51:44,960
Look, okay.

2205
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:47,000
That's cool.

2206
02:51:49,080 --> 02:51:50,780
Yeah, there's no other support I can play.

2207
02:51:51,500 --> 02:51:53,800
If we had two tanks, I'd play Invis.

2208
02:51:56,780 --> 02:51:57,600
Don't worry.

2209
02:51:57,900 --> 02:51:59,140
The hero is here.

2210
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:02,400
And they don't even have Phoenix.

2211
02:52:02,620 --> 02:52:03,280
I can do this.

2212
02:52:04,580 --> 02:52:05,280
Alright, guys.

2213
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:09,380
Oh, I mean, I could combo with our Punisher.

2214
02:52:11,560 --> 02:52:11,860
Yay!

2215
02:52:13,740 --> 02:52:15,880
Why are you out of my...

2216
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:18,400
That's fine.

2217
02:52:18,580 --> 02:52:19,420
We have...

2218
02:52:19,420 --> 02:52:21,180
Hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, hey guys.

2219
02:52:21,180 --> 02:52:22,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2220
02:52:26,020 --> 02:52:27,720
I don't know what's up with our Luna.

2221
02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:30,180
Walking 80 miles ahead.

2222
02:52:31,540 --> 02:52:34,100
Bro, there's like five people behind us.

2223
02:52:37,860 --> 02:52:39,160
Yeah, I wasn't gonna...

2224
02:52:39,580 --> 02:52:41,420
They killed us without...

2225
02:52:41,420 --> 02:52:43,580
I'm not getting all engaged with my...

2226
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:45,140
It's like the only thing we could do.

2227
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:51,920
My Luna, it likes really...

2228
02:52:52,600 --> 02:52:52,760
Fuck.

2229
02:52:54,620 --> 02:52:56,520
I mean, it almost has up.

2230
02:52:59,820 --> 02:53:00,160
Jesus.

2231
02:53:00,600 --> 02:53:04,560
The thing is, he doesn't have Mantis Boost, so he can't really one-shot us.

2232
02:53:06,040 --> 02:53:09,920
But like, that's like the one thing we can look forward to.

2233
02:53:11,300 --> 02:53:11,900
Alright.

2234
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:14,740
Alright.

2235
02:53:18,380 --> 02:53:19,700
There we go.

2236
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:21,180
We walk up.

2237
02:53:22,700 --> 02:53:23,600
But where's the others?

2238
02:53:24,020 --> 02:53:24,820
Wait, he got away?

2239
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:27,000
You ain't getting away here.

2240
02:53:28,180 --> 02:53:29,360
Oh my god!

2241
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,960
Hello, can we kill that little guy?

2242
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:36,940
Nice.

2243
02:53:38,280 --> 02:53:40,320
Alright, there's three of us on cart.

2244
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:41,280
Yay!

2245
02:53:42,440 --> 02:53:43,460
Go, Rigsie!

2246
02:53:43,580 --> 02:53:43,880
Go!

2247
02:53:44,460 --> 02:53:46,040
Let me put that rest here.

2248
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:49,260
We did it!

2249
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:50,540
Final score!

2250
02:53:50,920 --> 02:53:52,600
Three, two, two!

2251
02:53:53,560 --> 02:53:53,800
Yay!

2252
02:53:54,380 --> 02:53:54,920

30 PS kills combined together...

2260
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:15,100
Basically equals to Riggzy's kills.

2261
02:54:16,580 --> 02:54:17,500

2262
02:54:22,910 --> 02:54:40,110

2268
02:55:06,710 --> 02:55:10,430
Wait, what's the difference between prayer wall and shouts of praise?

2269
02:55:11,150 --> 02:55:12,490
Praying for the supernatural?

2270
02:55:12,870 --> 02:55:13,690
Excuse me?

2271
02:55:14,910 --> 02:55:16,030

Okay, I was going to say it.

2273
02:55:17,270 --> 02:55:20,050

2274
02:55:20,550 --> 02:55:20,890

02:56:21,110 --> 02:56:23,070

Um, work is very hard.

2337
03:01:08,200 --> 03:01:13,260
Uh, internet, you can't get fiber internet at a farm.

2338
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:15,740
Three, two, one.

2339
03:01:16,900 --> 03:01:17,940
Like, that's the thing.

2340
03:01:19,420 --> 03:01:25,340
I'm just like, because I'm just thinking, like, who would...

2341
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:28,240
Hard, and it's very hard work.

2342
03:01:28,460 --> 03:01:30,460
And I'd rather just play rivals.

2343
03:01:33,480 --> 03:01:36,680
And I'd rather play rivals and get farmed.

2344
03:01:44,950 --> 03:01:46,050
Oh, I accidentally used push.

2345
03:01:46,770 --> 03:01:48,610
I was just spamming my left click.

2346
03:01:48,870 --> 03:01:49,410
That's unlucky.

2347
03:01:51,910 --> 03:01:53,150
That's very unlucky.

2348
03:01:54,530 --> 03:01:57,870
I could have actually, like, pulled them, too.

2349
03:02:02,120 --> 03:02:02,540
Okay.

2350
03:02:03,920 --> 03:02:06,140
Alright, I don't have...

2351
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:08,960
That's fine.

2352
03:02:10,140 --> 03:02:10,440
Bye.

2353
03:02:11,020 --> 03:02:11,320
Yay!

2354
03:02:13,180 --> 03:02:14,100
Oh, I didn't pull them.

2355
03:02:14,620 --> 03:02:14,840
Unlucky.

2356
03:02:17,900 --> 03:02:18,360
Oh.

2357
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:21,300
Wait, what did it?

2358
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:21,600
Who?

2359
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:23,020
Oh my god, he's solo.

2360
03:02:23,240 --> 03:02:23,800
That's unlucky.

2361
03:02:24,320 --> 03:02:25,300
He was actually solo.

2362
03:02:26,940 --> 03:02:28,620
I don't know who he even ate.

2363
03:02:31,380 --> 03:02:33,800
All right, I hope our rocket helps first.

2364
03:02:36,420 --> 03:02:37,360
Who's that guy?

2365
03:02:37,420 --> 03:02:38,520
Oh, that's our strange.

2366
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:41,520
I was going to say, who the fuck is over there?

2367
03:02:44,420 --> 03:02:45,800
I was trying to push him.

2368
03:02:46,540 --> 03:02:48,060
Oh, I daredevil.

2369
03:02:51,180 --> 03:02:51,560
Alright.

2370
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:54,020
I hope our rocky elves first.

2371
03:02:54,340 --> 03:02:55,140
Oh my god, don't keep it.

2372
03:02:55,860 --> 03:02:57,520
Oh my god, oh my god.

2373
03:02:59,400 --> 03:03:00,700
My one rule.

2374
03:03:03,380 --> 03:03:05,900
That guy better turn it off.

2375
03:03:07,400 --> 03:03:08,500
I had one.

2376
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:10,280
One rule.

2377
03:03:13,380 --> 03:03:14,420
Fuck it.

2378
03:03:15,020 --> 03:03:15,240
Oh.

2379
03:03:15,900 --> 03:03:16,380
JK.

2380
03:03:18,340 --> 03:03:20,100
I should have trusted my rocket.

2381
03:03:20,560 --> 03:03:20,880
It's okay.

2382
03:03:21,180 --> 03:03:22,560
We're so confident.

2383
03:03:23,360 --> 03:03:26,140
We just want to give them a chance, you know?

2384
03:03:28,620 --> 03:03:32,340
We just want to give them a chance, guys.

2385
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:34,240
We know we're gonna win.

2386
03:03:34,380 --> 03:03:35,900
That's why we double support all of it.

2387
03:03:39,940 --> 03:03:58,740
guys we're so confident is it oh that's unlucky man if only we had another support uh not my fault it's not that's it i know it's the first technically

It'll be fine.

2391
03:04:13,720 --> 03:04:15,580

03:08:50,560 --> 03:08:53,160
Well, too bad for him, I guess.

2419
03:08:54,320 --> 03:08:55,640
I'm just gonna cap one.

2420
03:08:57,240 --> 03:08:58,280
Oh my god!

2421
03:08:58,940 --> 03:09:00,380
I didn't realize...

2422
03:09:00,380 --> 03:09:01,580
Bro, what the fuck?

2423
03:09:01,880 --> 03:09:02,880
What is he doing here?

2424
03:09:03,500 --> 03:09:03,780
When?

2425
03:09:03,960 --> 03:09:06,980
Oh, and when did he fucking play enough to have up?

2426
03:09:09,440 --> 03:09:11,800
Why did no one cap the point?

2427
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:13,000
We had three...

2428
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:13,860
No, no, no, no.

2429
03:09:14,520 --> 03:09:15,640
We had three down.

2430
03:09:15,660 --> 03:09:18,800
It wasn't even aiming at me, and it's just doing it.

2431
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:22,420
Like, like, legit, like...

2432
03:09:23,060 --> 03:09:25,280
Wait, what?

2433
03:09:25,280 --> 03:09:25,800
Bro.

2434
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:29,100
I fucking hate the voice change.

2435
03:09:29,660 --> 03:09:30,480
I hate that.

2436
03:09:34,380 --> 03:09:35,700
Oh, that's unfortunate.

2437
03:09:38,120 --> 03:09:39,700
We should have res, right?

2438
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:40,240
We do.

2439
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:44,920
All right, I'll rock it.

2440
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:45,640
As long as...

2441
03:09:45,640 --> 03:09:45,940
Alright.

2442
03:09:54,090 --> 03:09:55,410
Oh my god.

2443
03:09:56,250 --> 03:09:56,650
Please.

2444
03:09:58,530 --> 03:09:59,350
There you go.

2445
03:10:00,330 --> 03:10:01,410
I dodge everything.

2446
03:10:03,750 --> 03:10:04,530
I have up too.

2447
03:10:05,130 --> 03:10:06,190
Which is good.

2448
03:10:09,390 --> 03:10:09,630
Alright.

2449
03:10:10,030 --> 03:10:10,150
What?

2450
03:10:10,150 --> 03:10:11,510
My radar is over here.

2451
03:10:11,770 --> 03:10:12,110
Alright.

2452
03:10:12,110 --> 03:10:12,730
What the fuck?

2453
03:10:12,790 --> 03:10:13,550
How did they get over this?

2454
03:10:13,570 --> 03:10:15,070
There's a TP for that?

2455
03:10:15,650 --> 03:10:17,290
Bro, I didn't even know that.

2456
03:10:18,070 --> 03:10:18,610
Alright.

2457
03:10:18,710 --> 03:10:19,850
They have two fights.

2458
03:10:22,290 --> 03:10:24,930
All right, it's time to play chicken with my rocket again.

2459
03:10:25,250 --> 03:10:26,930
Who's gonna break first?

2460
03:10:28,570 --> 03:10:29,890
What the fuck?

2461
03:10:30,090 --> 03:10:31,250
Who's gonna break first?

2462
03:10:31,390 --> 03:10:32,230
Me or him?

2463
03:10:38,860 --> 03:10:40,660
My rocket, you know you want all first.

2464
03:10:41,660 --> 03:10:43,040
You know you want to.

2465
03:10:43,740 --> 03:10:44,780
We'll play the point.

2466
03:10:46,240 --> 03:10:47,380
Oh my god.

2467
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:51,600
Oh my god, please.

I mean, to be fair, let's get a win.

2470
03:11:59,200 --> 03:12:03,360
Fucking Mr. Pent- I feel like I should avoid the guy that played Mr. Pentast.

2471
03:12:03,820 --> 03:12:08,940
Like, I feel like doomer, true.

2472

Or just like, no, you, no.

2473

You should avoid all freeze.

2474
03:12:20,100 --> 03:12:22,020
Avoid both of them, but you're true.

2475
03:12:22,280 --> 03:12:22,740
Right, you're right.

2476
03:12:23,920 --> 03:12:24,540
Avoid both.

2477
03:12:24,680 --> 03:12:24,940

Yeah.

2480
03:13:29,700 --> 03:13:30,500
Oh, shit.

2481
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:32,100
I have a lot of work messages.

2482
03:13:34,200 --> 03:13:35,860
I can't give me a sec.

2483
03:13:44,700 --> 03:13:45,140
Alright.

2484
03:13:46,320 --> 03:13:48,880
I looked at it and I was like, oh, shit.

2485
03:13:50,660 --> 03:13:51,680
That's work stuff.

2486
03:13:52,520 --> 03:13:53,580
I'll do that later.

2487
03:13:54,580 --> 03:13:56,380
After I degen a little bit more.

2488
03:13:56,820 --> 03:13:57,360
I'll do it.

2489
03:13:57,360 --> 03:13:57,980
Oh, shit.

2490
03:13:58,060 --> 03:13:59,200
It's been three hours.

2491
03:13:59,440 --> 03:13:59,760
Fuck.

2492
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:00,960
I don't know.

2493
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:01,540
It's just...

2494
03:14:01,540 --> 03:14:03,460
There's just something about Marvel Rivals.

2495
03:14:03,780 --> 03:14:05,520
There's just something about it.

2496
03:14:05,900 --> 03:14:07,920
It does not feel like three hours.

2497
03:14:09,160 --> 03:14:09,540
Honestly.

2498
03:14:10,340 --> 03:14:15,360
Like I said, if I wasn't a variety streamer, I would play this game all the time.

2499
03:14:15,460 --> 03:14:16,680
I would stream this game all the time.

2500
03:14:17,280 --> 03:14:18,200
But I care.

2501
03:14:18,280 --> 03:14:20,380
That's how much I care about you guys.

2502
03:14:25,390 --> 03:14:26,550
Anything in the zombie mode?

2503
03:14:28,010 --> 03:14:29,810
One more than got a job.

2504
03:14:30,950 --> 03:14:31,290
Alright.

2505
03:14:31,550 --> 03:14:32,590
I mean...

2506
03:14:34,170 --> 03:14:36,330
I'll do like one more after he leaves.

2507
03:14:38,410 --> 03:14:39,070
That's how much...

2508
03:14:39,070 --> 03:14:39,290
See?

2509
03:14:39,670 --> 03:14:41,130
That's how much I care.

2510
03:14:42,910 --> 03:14:43,890
The thing just streamed only one...

2511
03:14:43,890 --> 03:14:45,670
Yeah, but then I get like too tired.

2512
03:14:45,950 --> 03:14:46,610
If I just keep...

2513
03:14:46,610 --> 03:14:51,710
If I just like stream Rivals on the side all the time.

2514
03:14:52,750 --> 03:14:55,850
Because I can only do it when I'm not as tired.

2515
03:14:58,110 --> 03:14:59,090
What do I have?

2516
03:15:00,550 --> 03:15:02,370
One may feel empathy for an enemy.

2517
03:15:02,930 --> 03:15:06,230
I haven't tried the zombie mode yet because I'm not PVE-er.

2518
03:15:06,490 --> 03:15:07,850
I know it's really fun, though.

2519
03:15:08,270 --> 03:15:10,610
I know everyone's telling me how fun it is, but I just...

2520
03:15:10,610 --> 03:15:12,850
I personally just don't play PVE.

2521
03:15:14,010 --> 03:15:14,590
I just fight...

2522
03:15:14,590 --> 03:15:17,510
I personally just think it's boring, like, when I play PVE.

2523
03:15:17,870 --> 03:15:19,470
I just want to fight other real people.

2524
03:15:21,870 --> 03:15:23,930
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

2525
03:15:28,970 --> 03:15:31,770
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

2526
03:15:33,670 --> 03:15:34,050
Alright.

2527
03:15:34,350 --> 03:15:35,910
I'll give you another Envis.

2528
03:15:36,110 --> 03:15:36,530
You know what?

2529
03:15:36,590 --> 03:15:39,010
I'll give you a Luna game.

2530
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:49,510
But if I swear to God, if I see one Venom player on the enemy team, I'm out.

2531
03:15:50,430 --> 03:15:51,850
It's Rocket Tap.

2532
03:15:51,910 --> 03:15:54,090
Yeah, I feel a little daring today.

2533
03:15:54,670 --> 03:15:57,690
And Luna gameplay in my Rocket stream?

2534
03:16:01,370 --> 03:16:08,290
If I see one Venom, Luna's about to become a furry.

2535
03:16:15,410 --> 03:16:17,810
Because Luna's gonna fucking grow a tail.

2536
03:16:18,170 --> 03:16:19,910
If I see one venom.

2537
03:16:28,220 --> 03:16:29,480
The band venom.

2538
03:16:30,460 --> 03:16:31,100
Alright,

2539
03:16:34,880 --> 03:16:35,660
we don't... Alright.

2540
03:16:36,100 --> 03:16:37,600
I guess I can play Luna.

2541
03:16:41,980 --> 03:16:42,620
Alright.

2542
03:16:42,760 --> 03:16:44,780
it has been made.

2543
03:16:51,270 --> 03:16:53,230
The enemy banned venom.

2544
03:16:54,090 --> 03:16:56,430
They were so they were too scared of my rocket.

2545
03:16:56,670 --> 03:16:57,590
They heard my thread.

2546
03:16:57,910 --> 03:16:59,790
We're like, we can't put her on rocket, guys.

2547
03:17:01,910 --> 03:17:04,390
Bro, we can't do that, bro.

2548
03:17:12,230 --> 03:17:12,870
Alright.

2549
03:17:18,920 --> 03:17:19,560
Um.

2550
03:17:21,320 --> 03:17:23,200
They'll be coming in 30 seconds.

2551
03:17:23,540 --> 03:17:24,100
Stay strong.

2552
03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:26,170
Nah, Torch is like, uh...

2553
03:17:28,660 --> 03:17:31,440
Torch is like not that great anymore.

2554
03:17:31,660 --> 03:17:32,860
That's why no one bans Torch.

2555
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:34,140
Aw.

2556
03:17:38,590 --> 03:17:41,130
Alright, if we lose, we blacklist him.

2557
03:17:45,640 --> 03:17:48,640
The deal doesn't stop after a game.

2558
03:17:53,520 --> 03:17:54,300
What the fuck?

2559
03:17:54,360 --> 03:17:56,740
Who doesn't go outside the door right away?

2560
03:17:57,980 --> 03:17:59,720
Fucking freak, who waits?

2561
03:18:00,660 --> 03:19:00,960
is open freaks oh yeah if that guy hits me one more time I'd be fun honestly and damage more all right actually have to do like 200% when I play Luna there's no like right here like there's no way the thing about Luna now is that you have to focus more so on damage too because your damage is fucking insane oh goodbye our damage is just too good now but like you have to heal less I should have used that clap I should have saved it for emergencies like right now oh that That is definitely an emergency.

2562
03:19:01,060 --> 03:19:03,120
That is definitely an emergency.

2563
03:19:05,780 --> 03:19:05,960
Oh!

2564
03:19:08,140 --> 03:19:09,460
Wow, guys.

2565
03:19:09,640 --> 03:19:11,740
If only I had to clap.

2566
03:19:14,280 --> 03:19:15,100
Oopsie.

2567
03:19:16,520 --> 03:19:18,740
Oh my god.

2568
03:19:19,140 --> 03:19:20,700
Oh my god.

2569
03:19:21,220 --> 03:19:21,700
Oh my god.

2570
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:23,360
Oh my god.

2571
03:19:23,360 --> 03:19:25,400
That's very unfortunate for him.

2572
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:32,280
Um, if he peeks me, I can heal.

2573
03:19:32,960 --> 03:19:33,440
You know what?

2574
03:19:33,460 --> 03:19:34,380
Fuck that, I guess.

2575
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:39,940
Oh, I guess I'll walk up.

2576
03:19:43,320 --> 03:19:44,880
How do I walk up?

2577
03:19:45,520 --> 03:19:47,480
I got jokes left.

2578
03:19:48,920 --> 03:19:49,620
It's okay.

2579
03:19:49,900 --> 03:19:51,280
They didn't need me anyway.

2580
03:19:52,040 --> 03:19:53,780
I was like, guys?

2581
03:19:53,780 --> 03:19:57,640
Emma said no.

2582
03:19:58,120 --> 03:20:00,780
She's like, you're not walking anytime soon.

2583
03:20:01,120 --> 03:20:03,060
We're going to fucking break your legs.

2584
03:20:03,280 --> 03:20:04,140
I was like, okay.

2585
03:20:05,880 --> 03:20:07,700
She knows I don't have insurance.

2586
03:20:12,780 --> 03:20:13,460
What do I do?

2587
03:20:13,560 --> 03:20:15,300
She's slowly walking up to me.

2588
03:20:17,100 --> 03:20:18,200
That's the scary part.

2589
03:20:18,300 --> 03:20:22,000
When they just walk up to you and you know you can't do anything.

2590
03:20:23,460 --> 03:20:26,740
And there's nothing you can do of about it.

2591
03:20:27,360 --> 03:20:28,600
I always say clap.

2592
03:20:30,520 --> 03:20:39,220
I need to, like, I sometimes, my one thing that, like, I always fuck up with is that I use clap way too.

2593
03:20:41,080 --> 03:20:42,180
Jesus, okay.

2594
03:20:43,960 --> 03:20:45,500
He's gonna wait now.

2595
03:20:45,780 --> 03:20:46,300
Oh, nice.

2596
03:20:47,340 --> 03:20:50,340
Oh, should have used it.

2597
03:20:52,520 --> 03:20:53,080
What?

2598
03:20:53,700 --> 03:20:55,240
Oh, put me back in the orb.

2599
03:20:55,480 --> 03:20:55,720
Bro!

2600
03:20:56,020 --> 03:20:56,240
Bro!

2601
03:20:57,220 --> 03:20:59,400
I'm like, how is he still alive?

2602
03:21:04,490 --> 03:21:05,130
Alright.

2603
03:21:06,150 --> 03:21:07,510
I got a little too scary.

2604
03:21:08,650 --> 03:21:10,770
He says, um, strange of...

2605
03:21:11,810 --> 03:21:15,630
I'm gonna slowly walk away from the strange of that they're planning on using.

2606
03:21:19,030 --> 03:21:19,670
Alright.

2607
03:21:20,890 --> 03:21:22,210
I saved him.

2608
03:21:23,150 --> 03:21:27,950
Alright, I'm gonna try and give our cloak up charge because, uh...

2609
03:21:28,630 --> 03:21:30,530
They most like, oh, that rocket's smart.

2610
03:21:31,850 --> 03:21:33,210
You mean you mean you shouldn't.

2611
03:21:34,650 --> 03:21:34,790
What?

2612
03:21:35,890 --> 03:21:38,290
You mean you don't just chuck it in the middle?

2613
03:21:39,950 --> 03:21:41,070
That's crazy.

2614
03:21:43,290 --> 03:21:44,310
Look at that.

2615
03:21:46,570 --> 03:21:47,470
I'm just saying.

2616
03:21:50,890 --> 03:21:51,110
Yay.

2617
03:21:54,870 --> 03:21:59,390
You mean you're not supposed to chuck your rocket in the middle of everyone?

2618
03:22:00,270 --> 03:22:01,990
What a wild concept.

2619
03:22:05,970 --> 03:22:07,950
A smart rocket player?

2620
03:22:08,630 --> 03:22:09,670
Not in my lobby.

2621
03:22:09,890 --> 03:22:11,850
Not at 6 in the morning.

2622
03:22:17,670 --> 03:22:19,130
Boom, boom.

2623
03:22:24,630 --> 03:22:26,490
Alright, here we go again.

2624
03:22:30,710 --> 03:22:32,470
See, look, I can win on Luna.

2625
03:22:35,050 --> 03:22:38,370
And before they foothold me, it's most likely gonna happen.

2626
03:22:44,790 --> 03:22:45,390
Um...

2627
03:22:45,390 --> 03:22:49,010
Wait, now that Rigsie's gone, who the fuck is gonna be my...

2628
03:22:49,010 --> 03:22:52,730
My 6k, uh, SILOC player?

2629
03:22:53,050 --> 03:22:54,530
Oh no, it's over.

2630
03:22:59,450 --> 03:23:03,850
Who else is gonna fucking kill four people at SILOC before the fight even...

2631
03:23:03,870 --> 03:23:33,450
begins oh oh thought he was actually gonna play another tank all right here we go Jesus that Phoenix got so much all charged from that oh if I got that freeze That would have been sick as fuck.

2632
03:23:36,250 --> 03:23:37,430
Don't worry, I got you.

2633
03:23:39,750 --> 03:23:40,790
Get that mutant!

2634
03:23:42,390 --> 03:23:43,350
I'll push the cart.

2635
03:23:44,110 --> 03:23:46,070
I'll let him get all the charge.

2636
03:23:46,770 --> 03:23:47,890
I'll just be, uh...

2637
03:23:47,890 --> 03:23:49,010
I'll just be cart bitch.

2638
03:23:51,950 --> 03:23:52,670
Yeah, surely.

2639
03:23:52,990 --> 03:23:55,030
Most likely I'll just get it on the enemy team.

2640
03:23:55,470 --> 03:23:57,250
Okay, if you're not gonna push the cart, just go up.

2641
03:23:57,410 --> 03:23:59,990
Why the fuck are you so far away from the team?

2642
03:24:00,170 --> 03:24:02,050
You're not even close to the cart.

2643
03:24:06,520 --> 03:24:07,960
Oh, yeah, no, it's over.

2644
03:24:08,420 --> 03:24:09,730
Might be a little creepy, though.

2645
03:24:10,980 --> 03:24:11,260
What?

2646
03:24:14,960 --> 03:24:15,540
Alright.

2647
03:24:17,780 --> 03:24:19,500
Oh, that's unfortunate.

2648
03:24:20,980 --> 03:24:22,420
That's very unfortunate.

2649
03:24:25,360 --> 03:24:25,740
Whatever.

2650
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:26,740
I'm wasting that.

2651
03:24:27,300 --> 03:24:27,880
I don't care.

2652
03:24:30,060 --> 03:24:30,520
Oh, my God.

2653
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:31,960
That Spider-Man was one!

2654
03:24:32,220 --> 03:24:33,980
Oh, he was one.

2655
03:24:34,700 --> 03:24:35,220
him.

2656
03:24:36,080 --> 03:24:36,080
See?

2657
03:24:36,540 --> 03:24:38,060
It was not a waste of a clap.

2658
03:24:38,360 --> 03:24:39,400
I got the spot, man.

2659
03:24:40,480 --> 03:24:41,480
Holy shit, he has up.

2660
03:24:43,680 --> 03:24:47,180
There is a sidewalk right behind me, and that's what's scaring me.

2661
03:24:49,740 --> 03:24:50,540
It's okay.

2662
03:24:50,820 --> 03:24:51,380
I have a clap.

2663
03:24:52,660 --> 03:24:53,900
Clap, clap, clap.

2664
03:24:59,120 --> 03:24:59,640
Yay!

2665
03:25:05,340 --> 03:25:05,860
Yay!

2666
03:25:06,600 --> 03:25:07,000
Easy.

2667
03:25:09,520 --> 03:25:11,140
It's because they banned Venom.

2668
03:25:11,680 --> 03:25:12,500
Thank fucking God.

2669
03:25:16,960 --> 03:25:19,020
Toki X made made art.

2670
03:25:19,360 --> 03:25:21,780
You don't even have to try that hard to find that.

2671
03:25:25,040 --> 03:25:26,720
That's just a given.

2672
03:25:28,220 --> 03:25:28,680
Okay, Toki.

2673
03:25:28,920 --> 03:25:30,100
I have to do a job now.

2674
03:25:31,740 --> 03:25:32,340
GG's.

2675
03:25:33,120 --> 03:25:33,720
GGs.

2676
03:25:34,300 --> 03:25:35,800
All right, we'll do one more game.

2677
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:38,260
True.

2678
03:25:39,140 --> 03:25:41,260
I bet one is being uploaded right now.

2679
03:25:44,600 --> 03:25:45,160
True.

2680
03:25:45,480 --> 03:25:46,480
Just go to Rule 34.

2681
03:25:51,010 --> 03:25:51,030
Alright.

2682
03:25:51,430 --> 03:25:53,030
One last game for the ride.

2683
03:25:54,110 --> 03:25:56,310
Unless someone else wants to join in.

2684
03:25:58,390 --> 03:26:00,350
One last game for the ride.

2685
03:26:05,800 --> 03:26:06,060
Alright.

2686
03:26:11,970 --> 03:26:14,390
Evil is a rejection of life.

2687
03:26:14,910 --> 03:26:16,390
Thus I am a guardian again.

2688
03:26:17,910 --> 03:26:19,830
Hello fellow role players.

2689
03:26:22,270 --> 03:26:23,630
Oh, that's the new Hulk skin, right?

2690
03:26:23,910 --> 03:26:32,130
The old, the last remaining, uh, the last remaining Hulk, like, per human on Earth or some shit?

2691
03:26:33,810 --> 03:26:35,530
We gotta give him a show then.

2692
03:26:36,030 --> 03:26:38,030
I mean, he has nothing for him.

2693
03:26:40,130 --> 03:26:41,870

All I'm saying Is that not to throw But if you win Your blacklist is from the cap

2718
03:29:52,940 --> 03:29:56,760
I'm not saying to throw But

2719
03:30:06,630 --> 03:30:13,210
But if the NM team somehow wins, that would be so unfortunate for him.

2720
03:30:24,530 --> 03:30:26,470
So unfortunate.

2721
03:30:29,470 --> 03:30:30,970
Play support.

Now you have to play Iron, like, Adam now.

2726
03:31:23,860 --> 03:31:26,060
Why else would Daredevil...

2727
03:31:26,060 --> 03:31:28,500
Why else would Iron Fist get banned as well?

2728
03:31:34,540 --> 03:31:36,900
I was going to be like, you can play Rocket.

2729
03:31:37,380 --> 03:31:39,100
But now, now you got to play Adam.

2730
03:31:45,140 --> 03:31:45,620
Oh.

2731
03:31:46,400 --> 03:31:47,880
My team is full of melee.

2732
03:31:51,140 --> 03:31:53,880
Look at these other guys.

2733
03:31:58,720 --> 03:32:00,180
Yeah, my team is full of melee.

2734
03:32:00,460 --> 03:32:02,620
It's not looking so high right now.

2735
03:32:10,750 --> 03:32:12,150
You could have stopped it.

2736
03:32:12,210 --> 03:32:14,270
You could have been the 20% that stopped it.

2737
03:32:15,950 --> 03:32:17,650
They're like, who is he talking to?

2738
03:32:17,670 --> 03:32:19,110
Because I haven't said anything.

2739
03:32:19,530 --> 03:32:25,630
And so they're like, who the fuck his heavenly father talked to this guy the heavenly emperor is gonna have schizo.

2740
03:32:26,890 --> 03:32:31,150
No one has said anything to him and he's having a conversation with himself.

2741
03:32:32,190 --> 03:32:33,690
And like he's schizo.

2742
03:32:35,390 --> 03:32:37,010
They think he's crazy.

2743
03:32:37,330 --> 03:32:40,370
I don't know because no one has said a single word.

2744
03:32:43,930 --> 03:32:45,790
They're like, what the fuck?

2745
03:32:46,170 --> 03:32:50,270
Oh wow, they have a fucking course they have a silo.

2746
03:32:53,290 --> 03:32:54,090
Wait,

2747
03:32:57,270 --> 03:32:58,150

2748
03:32:58,590 --> 03:33:00,650
Okay, okay, okay, that's a joke.

2749
03:33:00,930 --> 03:33:01,570
Don't go Adam.

2750
03:33:02,390 --> 03:33:05,830
They might think we're actually throwing.

2751
03:33:06,450 --> 03:33:07,490
Go rocket.

2752
03:33:07,990 --> 03:33:08,770
Go rocket.

2753
03:33:09,510 --> 03:33:11,450
You might actually get reported.

2754
03:33:13,450 --> 03:33:15,870
Bro said, we're joking.

2755
03:33:16,050 --> 03:33:17,110
I shall go Adam.

2756
03:33:19,410 --> 03:33:21,310
Bro is loyal.

2757
03:33:23,070 --> 03:33:25,470
Yeah, I don't want to get in trouble, guys.

2758
03:33:26,630 --> 03:33:29,670
Oh, I should have been, like, stay at him until the first point, and then he gets...

2759
03:33:30,830 --> 03:33:32,030
No, no, no, no.

2760
03:33:33,050 --> 03:33:35,850
I mean, yeah, I was gonna say, I think I could have got this man bad.

2761
03:33:37,790 --> 03:33:39,370
Oh, shit, we got two there.

2762
03:33:40,410 --> 03:33:40,810

03:33:42,450 --> 03:33:44,910
Okay, now you can go rocket.

Yeah, he is willing.

2766
03:33:49,930 --> 03:33:50,670
He is loyal.

2767
03:33:53,810 --> 03:33:55,630
Wait, we're on triple support.

2768
03:33:55,870 --> 03:33:56,480
Oh, he nerfs.

2769
03:33:58,790 --> 03:34:00,490
I don't want to...

2770
03:34:00,490 --> 03:34:02,010
I want to be like, get accepted.

2771
03:34:02,270 --> 03:34:03,270
Be like, look at...

2772
03:34:03,270 --> 03:34:07,390
Don't keep right up using her fan base to win Eel.

2773
03:34:11,130 --> 03:34:13,850
Like, like, Celestio 3.

2774
03:34:18,010 --> 03:34:20,190
Oh, shit.

2775
03:34:22,800 --> 03:34:23,860
Oh shit, goodbye Jeff.

2776
03:34:24,660 --> 03:34:26,520
That's unfortunate for him.

2777
03:34:32,020 --> 03:34:33,220
Oh shit.

2778
03:34:40,480 --> 03:34:43,720
We're okay, we're okay for now.

2779
03:34:44,820 --> 03:34:46,860
Oh this is...

2780
03:34:46,860 --> 03:34:47,340
I don't know.

2781
03:34:47,720 --> 03:34:48,580
Where's my group?

2782
03:34:48,920 --> 03:34:49,800
What the fuck?

2783
03:34:50,480 --> 03:34:52,220
Was the instructions unclear?

2784
03:34:57,260 --> 03:35:01,700
I heard group up and they're like just you though.

2785
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:02,200
Okay.

2786
03:35:03,280 --> 03:35:06,200
I like ran into the other because of it.

2787
03:35:07,260 --> 03:35:08,840
Like where did everyone go?

2788
03:35:10,100 --> 03:35:12,120
Were the instructions really that unclear?

2789
03:35:13,260 --> 03:35:14,440
The group of one.

2790
03:35:15,540 --> 03:35:18,180
How could I be the only one that grouped up?

2791
03:35:18,980 --> 03:35:20,720
Are Jeff is alive?

2792
03:35:22,940 --> 03:35:24,540
Go Jeff, go.

2793
03:35:29,140 --> 03:35:29,760
Oh my god!

2794
03:35:30,600 --> 03:35:31,120
Hey guys!

2795
03:35:32,240 --> 03:35:32,900
I'm scared.

2796
03:35:41,190 --> 03:35:42,910
Sorry bro, I had to kill him.

2797
03:35:48,430 --> 03:35:49,150
Alright.

2798
03:35:51,010 --> 03:35:53,310
I think our blade would have definitely lived.

2799
03:35:53,910 --> 03:35:54,410
For sure.

2800
03:35:55,550 --> 03:35:55,710
Oh.

2801
03:35:57,290 --> 03:35:58,010
Oh.

2802
03:35:59,010 --> 03:35:59,730
Oh.

2803
03:36:00,910 --> 03:36:01,470
Nope.

2804
03:36:02,770 --> 03:36:03,710
That's unlucky.

2805
03:36:05,250 --> 03:36:07,170
I even put it in the corner!

2806
03:36:07,550 --> 03:36:11,410
Oh, it's because there was a goddamn Namor behind us.

2807
03:36:14,330 --> 03:36:15,350
That's unlucky.

2808
03:36:17,690 --> 03:36:19,130
Oh, that's unlucky.

2809
03:36:20,210 --> 03:36:21,450
There was a Namor right.

2810
03:36:21,490 --> 03:36:25,890
I was gonna say, how the fuck did my ult get destroyed so fast?

2811
03:36:28,310 --> 03:36:30,250
He has ult, by the way.

2812
03:36:30,350 --> 03:36:30,890
Like, look at him.

2813
03:36:31,850 --> 03:36:35,390
He's like, he, what if I just, uh, right now?

2814
03:36:36,090 --> 03:36:36,630
Oh, she.

2815
03:36:38,870 --> 03:36:39,530
No, Bobo, no more?

2816
03:36:39,770 --> 03:36:41,110
It will never know.

2817
03:36:44,050 --> 03:36:44,670
Oh, fuck.

2818
03:36:44,810 --> 03:36:44,930
Okay.

2819
03:36:45,730 --> 03:36:46,630
You'll never know.

2820
03:36:47,390 --> 03:36:49,050
Bro, what do you want me to do?

2821
03:36:49,190 --> 03:36:52,190
I'm fucking, I'm just shooting my gun.

2822
03:36:53,130 --> 03:36:54,070
Oh, my God.

2823
03:36:54,150 --> 03:36:54,850
Are you kidding me?

2824
03:36:54,890 --> 03:36:55,970
I literally just got here.

2825
03:37:00,030 --> 03:37:00,890
Bro, I don't have...

2826
03:37:00,910 --> 03:37:02,730
I don't have anything.

2827
03:37:04,470 --> 03:37:06,630
There's just a portal in front of us.

2828
03:37:07,810 --> 03:37:08,550
Is this Winnebill?

2829
03:37:09,190 --> 03:37:10,410
Let's fucking find out.

2830
03:37:12,410 --> 03:37:13,990
Oh my god, okay.

2831
03:37:14,330 --> 03:37:16,050
And then our Jeff fucking dies.

2832
03:37:17,970 --> 03:37:20,310
Yeah, but you also got like...

2833
03:37:21,570 --> 03:37:22,170
Oh...

2834
03:37:22,170 --> 03:37:24,270
We have no healers.

2835
03:37:27,250 --> 03:37:29,170
I'm fucking sorry, I was crawling.

2836
03:37:30,630 --> 03:37:31,310
crawl.

2837
03:37:32,290 --> 03:37:32,730
Sorry, buddy.

2838
03:37:33,790 --> 03:37:34,510
Goodbye, Jeff.

2839
03:37:39,630 --> 03:37:42,050
At least where I...

2840
03:37:42,050 --> 03:37:44,670
Oh, that...

2841
03:37:44,670 --> 03:37:45,670
Oh, okay.

2842
03:37:46,590 --> 03:37:48,210
I don't want to deal with the name.

2843
03:37:48,590 --> 03:37:49,850
What the fuck?

2844
03:37:49,970 --> 03:37:51,130
Get me out of here!

2845
03:37:54,630 --> 03:37:55,570
It's okay.

2846
03:37:56,970 --> 03:37:58,470
Are you taking the heals?

2847

2850
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:18,540
It was cool.

2851
03:39:18,780 --> 03:39:21,260
We had it for one second.

2852
03:39:24,640 --> 03:39:27,220
Is that a rocket ship?

2853
03:39:27,680 --> 03:39:29,980
Is this someone getting banned at the maid cafe?

2854
03:39:30,660 --> 03:39:31,800

2855
03:39:40,240 --> 03:39:42,000
That's fucking right.

2856
03:39:46,180 --> 03:39:47,760
Bro, she looks so scared.

The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

2860
03:40:30,000 --> 03:40:32,640
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

2861
03:40:40,720 --> 03:40:44,140
All right, we have mag at least, you know.

2862
03:40:44,760 --> 03:40:45,440
That works.

2863
03:40:49,620 --> 03:40:53,280
Is there just a battle of the siloed players, honestly?

2864
03:40:54,400 --> 03:40:56,200
Animal Crossing time.

2865
03:40:59,120 --> 03:41:03,900

03:41:07,700 --> 03:41:08,940
Don't worry.

2867
03:41:09,900 --> 03:41:11,900
I feel so safe up here.

2868
03:41:14,120 --> 03:41:14,940
Look at me, go.

2869
03:41:15,940 --> 03:41:17,240
Don't worry, I have res.

2870
03:41:20,220 --> 03:41:21,720
Look at us.

2871
03:41:21,820 --> 03:41:23,700
Yo, we don't have two res's though.

2872
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:25,400
That's the unlucky part.

2873
03:41:27,020 --> 03:41:28,260
Jesus Christ.

2874
03:41:28,900 --> 03:41:29,480

I'm alive!

2880
03:41:44,180 --> 03:41:46,940
Look at that, that one second of that all being alive.

2881
03:41:48,040 --> 03:41:48,480
We're portaling.

2882
03:41:50,680 --> 03:41:52,540
Now you're gonna explain it.

2883
03:42:00,400 --> 03:42:02,460
Bro, I don't know what's going on.

2884
03:42:02,880 --> 03:42:04,120
Watch me start!

2885
03:42:07,200 --> 03:42:25,080
all right that's fine we're so healthy we don't have res but that's okay we we use the res for bait we use the res as bait for the other silo that's crazy that the uh

2886
03:42:28,500 --> 03:42:37,040
they were able to build up that fast though guys i don't have res i used it as bait it was like Might not been the smartest thing I've done, but...

2887
03:42:39,240 --> 03:42:41,080
Jesus Christ, I hope we have portal!

2888
03:42:41,900 --> 03:42:42,740
Oh, fuck!

2889
03:42:45,420 --> 03:42:46,800
Oh my god.

2890
03:42:47,360 --> 03:42:49,840
Okay, we gotta hope that they touch the...

2891
03:42:49,840 --> 03:42:51,540
That we saw, but...

2892
03:42:55,180 --> 03:42:56,860
Alright, guys, I don't think we're...

2893
03:42:56,860 --> 03:42:57,780
Oh, we're not...

2894
03:42:57,780 --> 03:42:59,180
We're not portaling!

2895
03:43:01,400 --> 03:43:01,960
Oh!

2896
03:43:05,160 --> 03:43:06,360
Very unlucky.

2897
03:43:10,080 --> 03:43:11,860
Oh, did the magic get rizz?

2898
03:43:12,220 --> 03:43:15,260
I thought, like, the siloed destroyed our rizz there.

2899
03:43:16,840 --> 03:43:22,140
I have a feeling that our silo might be getting dived.

2900
03:43:22,820 --> 03:43:23,680
Just a maybe.

2901
03:43:24,540 --> 03:43:25,540
My turn.

2902
03:43:29,000 --> 03:43:30,780
Guys, can you guys not shoot my...

2903
03:43:30,780 --> 03:43:32,140
Oh, it's not cool.

2904
03:43:33,460 --> 03:43:34,020
Not cool.

2905
03:43:34,040 --> 03:44:08,200

2907
03:44:27,310 --> 03:44:31,510

2908
03:44:37,090 --> 03:44:38,710
Never trust my team.

2909
03:44:40,030 --> 03:44:41,150
Never trust my team.

2910
03:44:41,470 --> 03:44:43,790
I literally, they're like, Group up, group up.

2911

I'll group up.

2914
03:44:50,610 --> 03:44:55,030
That's what good team player should do, right?

2915
03:44:59,210 --> 03:45:01,650
Good soldiers, listen to the winners.

2916
03:45:07,730 --> 03:45:11,790
Bro, there is like I refuse to...

2917
03:45:11,790 --> 03:45:13,530
No one has the alt now!

2918
03:45:15,310 --> 03:45:16,530
That's fucking right!

2919
03:45:17,110 --> 03:45:18,030
Yes, which alt lived?

2920
03:45:18,070 --> 03:45:20,910
The one in the open, not your stupid-ass corner alt!

2921
03:45:22,450 --> 03:45:23,730
That's fucking right!

2922
03:45:23,990 --> 03:45:27,070
The alt that was in the open somehow fucking survived.

2923
03:45:28,490 --> 03:45:29,990
Oh my god, that's bad.

2924
03:45:31,510 --> 03:45:32,370
Final score!

2925
03:45:32,810 --> 03:45:34,070
One, two, two!

2926
03:45:35,930 --> 03:45:37,610
You have to be shooting...

2927
03:45:37,610 --> 03:45:38,330
Okay, I'll do one more.

2928
03:45:39,510 --> 03:45:41,730
Yeah, my alt out is in the open.

2929
03:45:42,090 --> 03:45:43,370
Some house did not die.

2930
03:45:46,790 --> 03:45:47,090
He is.

2931
03:45:53,670 --> 03:45:54,970
That's right.

2932
03:46:02,800 --> 03:46:04,160

2933
03:46:04,160 --> 03:46:06,760
You know what to do for forgiveness.

I don't even think I've...

2953
03:48:11,300 --> 03:48:14,840
I don't even think I've streamed, like, 200 hours of Rivals.

2954
03:48:15,320 --> 03:48:17,100
Yeah, that's my...

2955
03:48:17,100 --> 03:48:21,380
I'm pretty sure 80% of that was me playing off-stream, too.

2956
03:48:21,680 --> 03:48:23,240
It wasn't even on-stream.

2959
03:48:55,480 --> 03:48:58,620

2960
03:49:01,340 --> 03:49:02,480
That's all I want.

2961
03:49:07,570 --> 03:49:08,730

03:49:08,970 --> 03:49:09,730
That one guy.

2963
03:49:11,590 --> 03:49:12,210
I don't even know.

2964
03:49:12,230 --> 03:49:13,850
I haven't used my alt accounts in so long.

2965
03:49:14,130 --> 03:49:14,690
That's the thing.

2966
03:49:14,770 --> 03:49:18,390
I think all my alt accounts are like, honestly, like, bronze right now.

2967
03:49:18,650 --> 03:49:20,170
Because I haven't touched it in that long.

2968
03:49:24,490 --> 03:49:28,250
I just want bragging rights to be nominated.

2969
03:49:29,810 --> 03:49:33,630
Yeah, I won a tournament while even playing in that tournament.

2970
03:49:33,990 --> 03:49:34,910
That is so true.

2971
03:49:39,090 --> 03:49:42,110
All the Europeans are on now because they want to do the...

2972
03:49:42,110 --> 03:49:45,410
I think, like, what, the Ignite games are going to start in a couple of hours.

2973
03:49:46,130 --> 03:49:52,850
No, I haven't touched zombies at all because I do not care about PvE.

2974
03:49:53,310 --> 03:49:57,150
I know it's apparently really fun, but I personally, I just don't care.

2975
03:49:57,650 --> 03:49:58,510
I've never...

2976
03:49:58,510 --> 03:50:01,610
Like, you can even say, like, what about, like, left...

2977
03:50:01,630 --> 03:51:19,350
for dead and stuff like that other dead is fun um i think also because i only enjoyed left for dead when it was modded i don't think i like vanilla left for dead because i think it's just you know it's just a zombie shooting game but when you mod it when you mod it and it's like like a teletub like you remember the the zombie teletubby shit and um even with friends yeah like it's the modded left for dead is so fucking fun as you have like you know you can use a base baby as a bomb was a baby wait no was the baby a med kit yeah the baby was the med kit and then I I loved picking up the babies and the whenever I remember back then like uh in the classic Lefford did Lefford did uh you can make the teletubbies as the zombies but like before they come in it'll be like uh they'll do like the teletubby song before they like slowly fucking yeah I swore um because there's like they're coming and then you just hear like tinsy-winsy mana they're like they're like they're coming po you haven't

2978
03:51:19,350 --> 03:51:33,490
learned it though yeah oh yeah the macho man the macho man tank yeah when you say oh yeah or the what was it the the Skyrim dragon too That shit was fucking scary as hell.

2979
03:51:35,530 --> 03:51:35,930
Wait, let me look.

2980
03:51:35,990 --> 03:51:37,250
I need to look at the Steam Workshop.

2981
03:51:38,270 --> 03:51:38,630
Steam Workshop.

2982
03:51:40,590 --> 03:51:41,610
Left-warded.

2983
03:51:41,690 --> 03:51:43,450
Oh, that's just like throwback, honestly.

2984
03:51:43,930 --> 03:51:45,450
Oh, Thomas the Tank Engine.

2985
03:51:45,830 --> 03:51:47,190
Oh, Thomas the...

2986
03:51:47,190 --> 03:51:51,710
I think my favorite mod with Thomas the Tank Engine was the Resident Evil.

2987
03:51:52,610 --> 03:51:56,890
The Resident Evil Thomas the Tank Engine mod with the... What's his name?

2988
03:51:57,170 --> 03:51:58,130
The guy in the...

2989
03:51:58,690 --> 03:52:00,890
The guy in the suit.

2990
03:52:01,470 --> 03:52:02,950
What was that guy's name?

2991
03:52:03,330 --> 03:52:04,590
That's fucking scary.

2992
03:52:05,810 --> 03:52:06,350
Mr. X.

2993
03:52:06,750 --> 03:52:09,250
Yeah, Mr. X has Thomas the tank engine.

2994
03:52:10,550 --> 03:52:11,670
That shit was fucking wild.

2995
03:52:12,210 --> 03:52:12,710
Leffered it.

2996
03:52:13,990 --> 03:52:15,230
Leffered it, too.

2997
03:52:15,810 --> 03:52:19,890
Most popular items in the past week of all time.

Oh my god, there's Minecraft song.

3004
03:52:42,170 --> 03:52:44,230
I think Teletubbies is the classic, though.

3005
03:52:45,070 --> 03:52:45,670
Teletubbies,

3006
03:52:48,890 --> 03:52:50,590

I'll be like, log into your, we'll have a PC there at the cafe.

3026
03:55:24,460 --> 03:55:30,800
I'll be like, log into your Marvel Rivals account before you can, before you can talk to Doki.

3027
03:55:31,480 --> 03:55:32,360
What do we got?

3028
03:55:42,320 --> 03:55:43,460
Bro, how do you die, bro?

3029
03:55:44,200 --> 03:55:44,380
Oh,

3030
03:55:51,020 --> 03:55:53,860
this is awkward.

3031
03:55:57,020 --> 03:56:15,100
enough healings for this like we do not have like it's because we don't have the team up too so that's pretty bad like if we had the team up it would be easier but we don't

3032
03:56:18,560 --> 03:56:22,900
can anyone else oh my god am i the only one hitting it like

3033
03:56:27,020 --> 03:56:29,240
Is there a reason we're on Blade or...

3034
03:56:29,240 --> 03:56:30,020
Why don't...

3035
03:56:30,020 --> 03:56:31,000
Why are we on Namur?

3036
03:56:32,800 --> 03:56:34,220
Why are we...

3037
03:56:34,220 --> 03:56:36,140
Wait, it's the AOMM agent.

3038
03:56:36,500 --> 03:56:37,180
Oh shit!

3039
03:56:37,800 --> 03:56:46,160
Wait, if you're the AOMM agent and I'm the AOMM agent...

3040
03:56:46,160 --> 03:56:46,620
Wait!

3041
03:56:51,220 --> 03:56:52,240
Let's recreate.

3042
03:56:55,300 --> 03:56:56,580
Oh, that's...

3043
03:56:57,020 --> 03:56:58,580
Yeah, forfeit

3044
03:57:03,720 --> 03:57:07,720
Wait a minute, who's driving this car?

3045
03:57:08,680 --> 03:57:08,680
All

3046
03:57:12,350 --> 03:57:17,970
right, I don't think we winning this though

3047
03:57:26,340 --> 03:57:35,460
We have to At least we broke that based on Yeah, I was gonna say it.

3048
03:57:38,680 --> 03:57:39,720
That's unfortunate.

3049
03:57:40,660 --> 03:57:42,020
I have to swap off.

3050
03:57:44,420 --> 03:57:48,040
Um, we originally had triple support and I've yet to die.

3051
03:57:48,460 --> 03:57:50,460
So like, that's not my fault.

3052
03:57:55,200 --> 03:57:57,060
Wait, they're triple support.

3053
03:57:57,200 --> 03:57:58,040
What the fuck?

3054
03:57:59,720 --> 03:58:01,920
What do you mean they're triple support?

3055
03:58:02,100 --> 03:58:02,920
That's not fair.

3056
03:58:05,120 --> 03:58:18,700
yes yeah we we went triple support but like that ain't fair how dare they also go triple support that should be illegal i

3057
03:58:23,520 --> 03:58:34,400
don't think i hit those yeah i'm still yet to die so this is very awkward for me oh my god that's all my leaves by the way

3058
03:58:38,000 --> 03:58:39,420
This is so bad.

3059
03:58:39,600 --> 03:58:40,840
This is like...

3060
03:58:46,340 --> 03:58:48,440
Oh my god, where?

3061
03:58:49,280 --> 03:58:50,800
Where is the L-enleashing?

3062
03:58:51,440 --> 03:58:53,620
Guys, we gotta help our magic, guys.

3063
03:58:57,610 --> 03:58:59,890
I was surprised I got my mantis out there.

3064
03:59:00,210 --> 03:59:01,290
Since I ulted first.

3065
03:59:08,910 --> 03:59:09,230
Guys?

3066
03:59:09,670 --> 03:59:10,670
Bro, I'm...

3067
03:59:13,490 --> 03:59:13,970
Bro!

3068
03:59:15,990 --> 03:59:16,830
Okay, that's fine.

3069
03:59:17,610 --> 03:59:18,550
I can farm this.

3070
03:59:21,350 --> 03:59:23,530
I'm trying my best to farm this part.

3071
03:59:27,190 --> 03:59:28,150
Hey, can we get that?

3072
03:59:28,770 --> 03:59:29,770
Like, I don't know.

3073
03:59:35,190 --> 03:59:36,150
Jesus Christ.

3074
03:59:37,790 --> 03:59:39,270
What's going on over there?

3075
03:59:39,350 --> 03:59:40,430
Like, who are they fighting?

3076
03:59:40,670 --> 03:59:42,750
They are actually fighting their inner demons right now.

3077
03:59:47,010 --> 03:59:48,230
Holy fuck.

3078
03:59:48,570 --> 03:59:50,570
I want to swap so badly.

3079
03:59:51,050 --> 03:59:54,530
We're like handicapped right now with our fucking heels.

3080
03:59:55,450 --> 03:59:58,650
Please, I've only died one time.

3081
03:59:59,830 --> 04:00:02,570
This is so... Are you serious?

3082
04:00:02,810 --> 04:00:05,130
Like, what's going on over there?

3083
04:00:13,040 --> 04:00:13,720
Jesus.

3084
04:00:14,420 --> 04:00:15,200
Oh, he has all.

3085
04:00:15,920 --> 04:00:17,960
Holy fuck, I knew he had all too.

3086
04:00:22,580 --> 04:00:23,840
Oh my god.

3087
04:00:26,540 --> 04:00:28,120
Please, just get him.

3088
04:00:28,440 --> 04:00:29,100
Get him, please.

3089
04:00:30,880 --> 04:00:31,920
Holy fuck out!

3090
04:00:32,280 --> 04:00:34,040
Okay, no ask questions.

3091
04:00:36,920 --> 04:00:37,660
Are you guys okay?

3092
04:00:37,860 --> 04:00:39,340
Like, who are you fighting right now?

3093
04:00:42,340 --> 04:00:43,900
I should heal him.

3094
04:00:44,420 --> 04:00:45,300
I tried.

3095
04:00:45,440 --> 04:00:45,800
I tried.

3096
04:00:45,920 --> 04:00:46,500
I really did.

3097
04:00:47,300 --> 04:00:48,180
I had no leaves.

3098
04:00:53,130 --> 04:00:55,410
I had no leaves, guys.

3099
04:00:55,750 --> 04:00:57,570
I had no leaves, guys.

3100
04:01:02,910 --> 04:01:06,430
Bro, look, we have too many EOMM agents, bro.

3101
04:01:08,210 --> 04:01:09,510
Like, I don't know what to say.

3102
04:01:11,230 --> 04:01:13,030
We're both EOMM agents.

3103
04:01:13,110 --> 04:01:14,810
I don't know what to say, man.

3104
04:01:17,770 --> 04:01:20,250
Oh my god, I'm so close to...

3105
04:01:25,620 --> 04:01:27,260
Oh my god, I finally died.

3106
04:01:27,360 --> 04:01:28,660
But I'm so close to...

3107
04:01:28,660 --> 04:01:30,880
I mean, we can still do this with my...

3108
04:01:31,580 --> 04:01:33,000
I think.

3109
04:01:34,140 --> 04:01:34,600
Please, please, please.

3110
04:01:34,940 --> 04:01:35,740
Are you fucking...

3111
04:01:35,740 --> 04:01:36,000
Okay.

3112
04:01:38,380 --> 04:01:39,100
That's unlucky.

3113
04:01:40,160 --> 04:01:41,880
I don't know if I can touch it, though.

3114
04:01:44,840 --> 04:01:45,620
I'm coming.

3115
04:01:45,840 --> 04:01:46,280
I'm touching!

3116
04:01:47,860 --> 04:01:49,580
All right, let's go.

3117
04:01:52,020 --> 04:01:53,460
Oh, I had a feeling.

3118
04:01:54,640 --> 04:01:55,120
It's okay.

3119
04:01:55,820 --> 04:01:57,640
Somehow it worked out.

3120
04:02:00,480 --> 04:02:02,880
Okay, now I can actually swap.

3121
04:02:04,520 --> 04:02:06,640
I can finally swap off.

3122
04:02:14,050 --> 04:02:15,430
I couldn't swap off.

3123
04:02:15,910 --> 04:02:17,830
I literally, it was so unfortunate.

3124
04:02:20,050 --> 04:02:22,190
I actually could finally swap.

3125
04:02:26,150 --> 04:02:27,610
Somehow it worked out.

3126
04:02:27,710 --> 04:02:28,470
I mean, they have.

3127
04:02:28,810 --> 04:02:30,210
Oh, they're not running triple support anymore.

3128
04:02:30,490 --> 04:02:31,410
Alright, now I can.

3129
04:02:32,310 --> 04:03:02,510
It was unfortunate because like we were very we were on a crutch right there with our heels But like I literally couldn't do anything because I was alive for way too long Oh you go mantis now like I mean you go like bro What do you mean you go like widow now you had I was mantis you go widow when I'm not on That is a real...

3130
04:03:02,510 --> 04:03:03,110
That never...

3131
04:03:03,110 --> 04:03:05,390
No, he wins the EOMM Agent Award.

3132
04:03:05,750 --> 04:03:06,730
He really does.

3133
04:03:07,370 --> 04:03:08,110
No, he won.

3134
04:03:11,210 --> 04:03:12,390
He wins.

3135
04:03:15,070 --> 04:03:17,290
Like, he's a better agent than me.

3136
04:03:19,510 --> 04:03:20,370
He really is.

3137
04:03:29,940 --> 04:03:31,260
That'll be fine, right?

3138
04:03:32,460 --> 04:03:33,060
But...

3139
04:03:33,060 --> 04:03:39,880
There you go.

3140
04:03:41,580 --> 04:04:45,500

There's like a hella, bro.

3148
04:06:00,140 --> 04:06:01,280
I tried my best.

3149
04:06:02,160 --> 04:06:03,580
I'm so scared of that hella.

3150
04:06:07,220 --> 04:06:08,740
Oh, I don't have...

3151
04:06:12,290 --> 04:06:14,430
Maybe careful with my stuff, though.

3152
04:06:16,310 --> 04:06:18,490
Alright, we have a...

3153
04:06:19,550 --> 04:06:20,570
Oh, nice.

3154
04:06:20,910 --> 04:06:22,730
Oh, I think he still grabs somebody, though.

3155
04:06:23,990 --> 04:06:25,850
Yeah, I don't know if I can ult this.

3156
04:06:29,280 --> 04:06:30,380
Oh, nice.

3157
04:06:30,960 --> 04:06:31,760
Oh, not nice.

3158
04:06:32,460 --> 04:06:33,400
Only one person lived.

3159
04:06:35,920 --> 04:06:39,100
I feel like we have to use Cloak first.

3160
04:06:39,680 --> 04:06:40,640
Cloak is the better aggressor.

3161
04:06:42,120 --> 04:06:42,840
Yeah.

3162
04:06:44,800 --> 04:06:49,700
I don't know if...

3163
04:06:49,700 --> 04:06:51,800
I personally...

3164
04:06:51,800 --> 04:06:53,540
Oh, I have to use this.

3165
04:06:54,120 --> 04:06:54,680
Like...

3166
04:06:55,420 --> 04:06:57,400
Thank God for all the...

3167
04:06:57,400 --> 04:06:57,840
It's so...

3168
04:07:01,320 --> 04:07:02,960
I don't think...

3169
04:07:02,960 --> 04:07:03,540
I don't know.

3170
04:07:06,000 --> 04:07:08,700
I don't know if...

3171
04:07:09,720 --> 04:07:11,860
I don't know if...

3172
04:07:12,620 --> 04:07:13,580
Moon Knight is the answer.

3173
04:07:14,460 --> 04:07:15,340
I don't think the Moon...

3174
04:07:15,340 --> 04:07:17,440
He said, don't worry, Moon Knight is shredding.

3175
04:07:17,980 --> 04:07:21,280
But I have a feeling that Moon Knight is...

3176
04:07:21,280 --> 04:07:22,720
May or may not be shredding.

3177
04:07:22,980 --> 04:07:23,620
Just maybe.

3178
04:07:29,200 --> 04:07:29,640
Okay.

3179
04:07:31,140 --> 04:07:32,060
This may be though.

3180
04:07:35,700 --> 04:07:37,460
You know, you know, you're always safe with me, Herbie.

3181
04:07:38,580 --> 04:07:41,460
He has, oh, so we gotta kill him before like anything happens.

3182
04:07:42,140 --> 04:07:45,020
But he's just gonna pour, oh, they're just gonna pour to this.

3183
04:07:45,520 --> 04:07:45,840
There you go.

3184
04:07:46,060 --> 04:07:47,220
Hi guys, you know what?

3185
04:07:47,920 --> 04:07:50,000
I did...

3186
04:07:50,680 --> 04:07:51,440
We get that?

3187
04:07:51,500 --> 04:07:52,220
Yes, we can.

3188
04:07:52,380 --> 04:07:52,800
That's good.

3189
04:07:53,220 --> 04:07:55,640
There's like a fucking Jeff behind us?

3190
04:07:55,940 --> 04:07:57,440
But I guess we can ignore him.

3191
04:07:58,880 --> 04:08:08,280
right he's fucking trying to shred my shield but that's all right i still don't think he's shredding

3192
04:08:13,180 --> 04:08:17,130
don't die to this jeff he died to the jeff

3193
04:08:21,860 --> 04:08:27,840
i'm sorry there's nothing i can do bro

3194
04:08:33,470 --> 04:08:36,330
I don't think there was something I could do.

3195
04:08:37,090 --> 04:08:38,730
I could just watch him get eaten.

3196
04:08:39,210 --> 04:08:40,570
That's the most fucked up part.

3197
04:08:43,250 --> 04:08:48,070
I just, all I could do was just watch and say goodbye.
