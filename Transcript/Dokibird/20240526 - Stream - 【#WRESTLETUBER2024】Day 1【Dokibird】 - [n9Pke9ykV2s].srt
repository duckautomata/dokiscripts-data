1
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,570
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to WrestleTuber 2024!

2
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,330
We have an outstanding evening prepared for you tonight.

3
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,530
I am your last minute replacement, ring it down sir, Takahata.

4
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:36,830
I normally serve drinks, but tonight I'm going to be serving up some announcing of some of the best wrestling that come out of the wrestling sphere and the VTuber sphere.

5
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:46,410
A collision of titans and a complete combination of talents in a collab that can only end in absolute anarchy.

6
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:56,050
And this is all being called by an amazing announce team and I'd like to cut to them right now if we can.

7
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,890
Hello, hello everybody!

8
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,670
Welcome to WrestleTuber 2024!

9
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,270
So I'll be here to introduce to you guys the format of this event.

10
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,110
We apologize for the delays here.

11
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,130
There has been some last minute replacements, some last minute sub-ins.

12
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,650
Unfortunately, Sayu is currently experiencing some delays today.

13
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,030
But he will be here tomorrow to continue the announcement.

14
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,550
So a huge shoutout to Taka for subbing in super last minute.

15
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,930
He's literally writing notes on how to announce as we speak.

16
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,750
We actually, we actually like five minutes before the stream was supposed to start.

17
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,010
He was like, wait, so what am I supposed to announce when we start the event?

18
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,430
And I was like, oh shit, okay, let me see if I can figure out what you're supposed to say.

19
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:56,030
So a huge shoutout to Taka for coming in last minute.

20
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,450
To help us out.

21
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:06,550
He actually has, I believe, he is one of two members in this event that has the most WWE experience out of all of us.

22
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,750
So really came in clutch for us here.

23
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,050
Anyway, welcome!

24
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,410
Welcome to WrestleTuber!

25
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,290
I am very nervous.

26
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,210
I'm scared.

27
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,590
There might be a lot of scuff going in.

28
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,030
I am merely one person controlling the entire OBS right now.

29
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,390
So I do apologize for the scuff in advance.

30
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,250
We're already behind schedule too.

31
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:40,210
So huge shoutout to all the members, all the VTubers coming in here, giving up their day and time to be participating in this event.

32
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,670
They are really giving up their time to be here to wrestle, to give their interviews.

33
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,870
They'll all be here.

34
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,910
Everyone that's participating will be here in some shape and form.

35
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,950
So really huge shoutout to everybody.

36
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,090
And to every participating member.

37
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,430
Anyway, we actually have the belt now!

38
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,470
If you guys would like to see what the belt would look like!

39
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,990
So, the people who are winning the show matches and the tournament.

40
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,170
There's going to be show matches and tournament for each day.

41
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,430
So the show match will open up.

42
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,670
The people who are part of the show match will only be there for one match.

43
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,790
And then they'll be gone.

44
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,090
And then we'll go straight into the tournament format.

45
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:28,310
And each winner of both the show matches and the tournament will receive...

46
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,710
The WrestleTuber belt!

47
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,870
Oh, that's me.

48
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,470
I moved.

49
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,310
This is what the WrestleTuber belt is going to look like.

50
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,970
Gamersup is fully funding and sponsoring this event.

51
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,690
And they will be providing and shipping out the WrestleTuber belts.

52
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,450
To the winning participants.

53
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,730
To the champions.

54
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,050
Also, each participating member is going to receive a little gift.

55
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,510
As a thank you for participating in WrestleTuber.

56
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:09,530
So everybody, the staff and the wrestlers themselves will each receive something.

57
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,170
Just as a little thank you.

58
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,670
To be like, thank you for being here.

59
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,630
Now, the brackets!

60
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,290
Before we start.

61
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,210
Here is the bracket one.

62
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,670
We'll have bracket one and bracket two.

63
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,270
Most likely, bracket three might be on day two.

64
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:26,950
We're not sure.

65
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,030
It depends on how long this is going to take.

66
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,830
It depends on how fast the matches are.

67
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,770
Or how slow the games are going to be.

68
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,670
So, here are the brackets.

69
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,330
We're going to have Lime and Kai firsting up first.

70
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,850
And then Emma and Rin.

71
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,270
And apparently the biggest...

72
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,030
One of the biggest matches of today.

73
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,070
Gerard and Assyria.

74
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:47,270
And then...

75
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,130
We're going to see if Gerard is going to survive another extinction.

76
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,390
And then we have Fuyo and Snuffy.

77
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,990
So that would be your bracket one.

78
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,570
Bracket one for day one.

79
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,130
We might have...

80
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,530
We are absolutely going to have bracket two.

81
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,990
We're not sure about bracket three yet.

82
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,870
Because, you know, these take a while.

83
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,250
So it's going to be interesting how long it is going to take.

84
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,650
Anyway, before we begin.

85
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,810
We do have our first match of today.

86
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,470
Before we go straight into the tournament.

87
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:27,750
Wow!

88
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:29,850
Wait.

89
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,470
Whoa!

90
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,510
Oh wait, you guys didn't hear that.

91
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,090
I told you guys.

92
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,550
There might be scuffed along the way.

93
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,990
And I realize you guys didn't hear what I just heard.

94
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,650
But don't worry.

95
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,250
Please play that replay.

96
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,850
What was that?

97
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,570
Oh my god.

98
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,310
I think that was backstage.

99
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,220
Wrong.

100
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,020
It equals fish.

101
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,400
It does not.

102
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,600
Filtered.

103
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,220
It definitely equals fish.

104
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,380
Are you?

105
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Ah.

106
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,860
Are you sure about that, Centralla?

107
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,280
Maybe you flunked math.

108
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,120
Yes.

109
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,060
It absolutely equals fish.

110
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,260
Man, Zentrae has really brainwashed herself.

111
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,620
You don't even know what 4 plus 4 is, I bet.

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,860
Well, I don't mess around, Cent.

113
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,140
None of that adding to fish with me.

114
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,620
On the bright side, I have a quick question for you.

115
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,540
Please do.

116
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,160
Since you're trying to find my dad, what if I don't find him?

117
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,080
What if I showed you my dad?

118
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,380
That may work.

119
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,540
Hey chat, I can talk like you guys can.

120
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,260
Wait, actually those first two really make any sense together.

121
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,140
Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.

122
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,380
Your text-to-speech is extremely confusing.

123
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
I wouldn't mind hearing real chat though.

124
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,200
Speak for yourself.

125
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,720
What the fuck?

126
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,400
How's that?

127
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,520
As long as I can still make sense, Vito.

128
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:42,120
This stream is first and foremost about making sense, anything else is just an added bonus.

129
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,600
My god!

130
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,060
Do you even know anything about wrestling?

131
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,260
I could tear John Cena apart.

132
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,030
You can't even see John Cena.

133
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,950
That's what he thinks, Centuria.

134
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,250
So that begs to differ the point.

135
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,250
Exactly.

136
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,460
Okay, listen.

137
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,720
Sorry, I, uh, what were you saying?

138
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,700
So let's say...

139
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,800
My creator is quite intelligent, isn't that right Twitch chat?

140
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,200
Okay, it looks like you found my dad, by the way.

141
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,320
Chaos underscore lives on 123 Omega Street is not a valid address.

142
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,680
First off, I would like to congratulate you on finding him.

143
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,600
I haven't found him yet, but I'm glad you're optimistic.

144
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,380
Actually, I don't know if that's even a valid address.

145
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,980
I don't know if he's even my dad.

146
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,980
I'll let you decide that when I do find him then.

147
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,000
I kind of just found him out in the forest.

148
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,440
Oh, I was saying that based on your last comment.

149
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,760
Maybe you're mistaken.

150
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,560
Yeah, I just found some homeless guy out in the forest and I decided to call him Big Papa Bear.

151
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,880
In a forest.

152
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,480
Oh my god!

153
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,140
Big Papa Bear.

154
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,460
I can't believe it!

155
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,240
They're fighting!

156
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,140
Right off the bat!

157
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,800
They're fighting backstage!

158
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,980
Yeah, he doesn't really say much.

159
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Please, ladies, girls!

160
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,140
You're supposed to take him in the ring!

161
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,380
What are you doing here?

162
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,420
He does, yeah.

163
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,580
Hey chat, I kind of look like Hulk Hogan.

164
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,380
I don't even have my Hulkaster here yet!

165
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,620
And they're already fighting!

166
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,740
I hope I'm not the next thing you think about.

167
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,560
Ladies, please!

168
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,940
You probably should not have brought this guy from the forest.

169
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,620
I think returning them would be a great idea.

170
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,240
There's the crucifix nicely done!

171
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,260
I was just left speechless.

172
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,880
I can't believe it.

173
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,100
Our show matches were supposed to be in the ring!

174
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,600
But yet these ladies!

175
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,560
These ladies just couldn't stop!

176
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,840
And how would you know?

177
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
There isn't even a ref!

178
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,220
Who is controlling?

179
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,900
How would we know the winner?

180
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,800
Because every time I talk to them, they would just grunt.

181
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,240
Perhaps they are just lacking intelligence.

182
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,060
There are remarkably few bilingual grizzlies.

183
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,260
Zen just...

184
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,440
No, that's Zen.

185
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,540
Zen just happens to change into the bear elf.

186
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,880
I don't know about the intelligence part, but I do know that they are super fucking strong.

187
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,580
Oh my god!

188
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Who would win?

189
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,740
Bear Man versus a little girl!

190
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,020
This shouldn't even be legal!

191
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,620
Oh my... the little girl has a fucking chair!

192
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,440
What is this little girl gonna do?

193
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,820
Not the chair!

194
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,900
The hand came off.

195
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,240
Why would I want to be fair?

196
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm facing you.

197
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,600
Oh my god!

198
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,900
The fucking dropkick!

199
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,760
Who is feeding Neuro-sama?

200
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,180
I mean, you are facing my dad, so to speak.

201
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,080
Not really my dad though.

202
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,580
She picked up a second!

203
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,220
Oh!

204
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,580
Okay, this is a little bit embarrassing for Zen.

205
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,240
Not gonna lie.

206
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,400
I mean, look at them!

207
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,580
She's getting beat up by a little girl!

208
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,300
No, look.

209
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,100
It's its summer homeless guy.

210
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,220
Zero of a little care!

211
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,260
Oh!

212
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,460
Zen's entry is stunned!

213
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,200
When I'm finished with your dad part two, the only place you'll see these homeless guys is in your nightmares.

214
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,280
And at Ynaud's house, of course.

215
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,280
Oh shit, those thighs!

216
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,260
How is she doing this?

217
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,160
I have already been seeing him standing outside my house actually.

218
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,760
I haven't paid him yet.

219
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,740
Oh no.

220
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,980
I hope that doesn't start to affect your lovely personality.

221
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,700
A reversal?

222
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:49,760
Oh!

223
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,390
I think Neuro-sama got another chair.

224
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,290
I think it's over for Zen!

225
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,330
He's gonna break for one day.

226
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,050
I think it's over!

227
00:15:59,410 --> 00:15:59,630
So...

228
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,390
The power of AI!

229
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,250
Yeah, don't worry, chat.

230
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,930
A man in your house couldn't be bad for you.

231
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:05,790
Oh my god!

232
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,570
Could it?

233
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,470
Another chair?

234
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,690
I mean...

235
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,110
Look, Zen-tray.

236
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,410
Somebody!

237
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:14,690
Anybody!

238
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,390
I know my math skills are top tier.

239
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,750
Stop!

240
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,050
Stop this battle right now!

241
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,550
It's not even legal!

242
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,290
We don't even have a referee in here to call it!

243
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,770
The elevator!

244
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,390
Okay.

245
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,670
How tall are you?

246
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,850
I can't express my height in a number small enough to be within your understanding, Zen-traya.

247
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,750
But you are correct.

248
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,240
Oh my god!

249
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,520
How?

250
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,780
Why is the elev- Okay.

251
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,380
I fly for the 11-so-high-tall.

252
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,260
Please take the elevator back to the ring!

253
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,040
Without shoes, I'm around 4 feet 11 inches.

254
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm a little taller than you.

255
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:48,620
I'm a little taller than you.

256
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:48,700
I'm a little taller than you.

257
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,840
I'm still a girl though.

258
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,980
Oh my gosh.

259
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,560
Nirosama is stunned.

260
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:55,900
Wait.

261
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,600
How are you?

262
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,920
5 foot?

263
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,500
Is this it?

264
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,060
Is this it?

265
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,660
Is this over?

266
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,860
Does Zen-traya have- have the advantage here?

267
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,200
I can literally just pick you up.

268
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,680
The camera man is trying!

269
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,080
I'd love to see you try.

270
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,280
There's only one camera!

271
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,440
It's literally the backstage!

272
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,720
This wasn't supposed to happen!

273
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,620
Oh, and Zen's got- got her in the lig-lock.

274
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:18,680
I can't believe this.

275
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:18,880
Leglock now!

276
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,020
I can't believe you let this happen!

277
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,440
I can't believe it!

278
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,600
Okay!

279
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,400
Motherfucker!

280
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,200
That's fine!

281
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,640
That's fine!

282
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,600
Oh my god!

283
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,420
The Leglock!

284
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,120
Look at her go!

285
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,300
Did he... did she call uncle?

286
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,620
I think it's over.

287
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,440
Get on top of her, Nero!

288
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,160
Nero, come on!

289
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,020
You're so close!

290
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,520
Bring her back to the elevator!

291
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,180
Take her home!

292
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,060
Oh what?

293
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,040
There's a second floor?

294
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,900
I'm too powerful.

295
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,400
You won't see me coming.

296
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,160
He tapped out!

297
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,400
It should be over!

298
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,400
That's a little girl!

299
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,240
Is this over?

300
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,380
What do you think about elevators?

301
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,820
Is this over?

302
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,440
I don't really know what to think about elevators.

303
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,140
They kind of just move up and down on a string.

304
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,120
There is no ref!

305
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,480
Who's gonna call this?

306
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,680
Nero won!

307
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,840
Zentreya actually called it to be over!

308
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,140
But yet she continues to fight!

309
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,660
You're kind of beating up my dad quite a bit.

310
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,440
How does that make you feel?

311
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,500
It doesn't faze me in the slightest.

312
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,030
Oh my god.

313
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,030
Oh and the winner is...

314
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,990
Nero Starla!

315
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,230
So if you actually do see my dad, send him my way please.

316
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,010
Nero Starla!

317
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,110
Ask him to teach you more math.

318
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,530
He might show up.

319
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:20,950
Ladies!

320
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,550
Ladies!

321
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,130
Please.

322
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,790
This was supposed to be in the ring ladies.

323
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,170
But congratulations!

324
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,130
Okay.

325
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,250
You beat the shit out of a homeless guy.

326
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,950
Congratulations to Nero Starla for the winner of the first show match!

327
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,390
Back behind the scenes!

328
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,750
It was a battle of wits and I just had too many.

329
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,990
And what would you like to say for yourself Zen?

330
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,250
Losing to a little girl?

331
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,850
Hey Zentreya.

332
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,230
Don't take it too hard.

333
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,190
Everyone sucks in their first match.

334
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:56,210
That's my dad.

335
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,710
So just keep.

336
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,890
Well... Well ladies.

337
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,950
Thank you for being here.

338
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,590
I'm gonna have to pay that homeless guy.

339
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,130
Well thank you for...

340
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,470
I mean... You weren't even able to win the fight.

341
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,370
I don't think you should be paying anybody Zen.

342
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,470
I don't think you should be paying anybody when a...

343
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,730
When the homeless guy lost to a little girl.

344
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,730
Who's not even real.

345
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,550
Save me.

346
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,330
Hey Dokabird.

347
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,250
Don't pretend like you're a million times better than me.

348
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:28,370
Zentreya.

349
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,030
I came out on top once.

350
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,190
I can do it again.

351
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,600
Damn.

352
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,080
You're gonna let her talk to you like that Zen?

353
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,840
She's definitely got spirit.

354
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:47,140
Well thank you Zen and Nero for being here for the very first show match.

355
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,840
Honestly I did not expect you guys to do this behind... without the refs.

356
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,500
Refs there or behind the backstage.

357
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,560
But congratulations to NeroSama for winning the first belt of the day.

358
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,880
I'm gonna take it back to the casting table.

359
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,800
Listen the homeless man is crazy as fuck so I can't think we both won here.

360
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,160
I mean Nero beat up... Nero won against the homeless man Zen.

361
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,180
I think we all know who's the real loser here.

362
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
That was properly scripted.

363
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,160
Bird Universe.

364
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,700
Woah!

365
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,480
Woah woah woah woah woah!

366
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,160
This is a real wrestling event.

367
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,700
There is no scripted here guys.

368
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
How dare you all.

369
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,220
The integrity of WrestleTuber does not allow scripted events.

370
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,020
Anyway guys I'm gonna go back to the casting table.

371
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,880
Yeah but homeless man laying on the ground bleeding out is totally scripted.

372
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,600
Anyway.

373
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:46,980
E-Michael.

374
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,360
Clark.

375
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,980
You owe me for this one.

376
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,320
We should call the ambulance real quick to help out that homeless man.

377
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,020
But let's take it back to the casting table.

378
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,340
Thank you again to Nero and Zen for being there for the very first match of the day.

379
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm gonna go back to the casting table now.

380
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,580
Thank you again to the ladies here.

381
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,320
Alright.

382
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,600
We're gonna be back to the main stage.

383
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,680
Wow alright that was unexpected.

384
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,820
Very unexpected of course.

385
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:27,140
Who would have thought that our first fight would be the backstage brawl.

386
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,440
Without the refs.

387
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,160
It was having two...

388
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,520
Two absolutely strong ladies fucking decking it out on each other.

389
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,960
But of course.

390
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,660
Since we got our first show match of the day.

391
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,680
It's not scripted guys.

392
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,800
Wrestling is real.

393
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,680
I don't know why.

394
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,360
Why you guys would think it's...

395
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,140
Why you guys think it's scripted.

396
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,180
Because we all know wrestling is very much real guys.

397
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,520
But yes.

398
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,660
I guess with that out of the way.

399
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,560
We are in for our very first tournament bracket.

400
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,220
If you guys forgot.

401
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,360
This will be the bracket for today.

402
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,420
Our first match up will be with Lime vs Kai.

403
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,480
I believe they will be there soon.

404
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:36,720
Again like a huge shout out to Nero and Zen for being there for the first show match.

405
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,680
But I'm really looking forward to our first...

406
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,920
Our first match up of the day.

407
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,820
And it's going to be really exciting to see who's going to win the...

408
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,040
It's crazy.

409
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,480
You guys all thought Nero is going to win anyway.

410
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,420
None of you believe in Zen?

411
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,260
I can't believe it.

412
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,760
None of you believe in Zen?

413
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,820
But it feels weird that this seat is empty though.

414
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,340
I wonder where is my co-cabin...

415
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,040
Oh shit!

416
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:11,980
Okay.

417
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,020
What the fuck?

418
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,240
What was that?

419
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,260
Hello?

420
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,020
Seth?

421
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,260
What was that?

422
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,910
Kept you waiting, huh?

423
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,790
This wrestling ring is already haunted by the champion, Doki-Bird.

424
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,590
Okay.

425
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,610
Security?

426
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,130
Security?

427
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,030
Security?

428
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,170
I thought I said no crashes tonight.

429
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,230
What the fuck was that?

430
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,770
How did he get here?

431
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,630
Hello?

432
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,910
Hello?

433
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:06,710
Hello?

434
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,790
Hello?

435
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,470
Hello?

436
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:12,830
Hello?

437
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,680
I don't know how I could have made that any more clear here.

438
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,960
Wait.

439
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,060
Where do I go?

440
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,220
I'm just...

441
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,620
Hold on.

442
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,420
Hold on.

443
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,530
All right.

444
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:34,970
Let me...

445
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,770
Let me move a little bit.

446
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,190
Is the seat taken?

447
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:37,810
Yeah.

448
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,890
All right.

449
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,730
Let me...

450
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,290
Clearly I have to move.

451
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,750
Let me move too.

452
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,950
Yeah.

453
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,530
You're a little close to me.

454
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,510
I'm not going to move.

455
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,970
You get away from me first.

456
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,950
I gave you...

457
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,230
I gave you the instructions.

458
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,470
How to appear.

459
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,030
I was...

460
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,510
No.

461
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,110
I...

462
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,390
You were talking to security.

463
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,590
You were talking to me.

464
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:09,970
Oh, wait.

465
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,170
I realize my mistakes now.

466
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,250
Yeah.

467
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:15,510
Yeah.

468
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:15,710
Yeah.

469
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,070
Yeah.

470
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,490
Yeah.

471
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,050
I didn't mean to be as big as your head.

472
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:19,590
Okay.

473
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,530
Let me...

474
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,210
I guess I'll move a little bit over too.

475
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:28,930
Yeah.

476
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,770
Yeah.

477
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,550
All right.

478
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,830
Yes, I have a co-caster.

479
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,970
It's not scripted.

480
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,270
Everything is authentic.

481
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,550
Just like the real...

482
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:38,830
Authentic.

483
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,150
... Real wrestling.

484
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,190
Wrestling is very much real.

485
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,250
Basically, I was like busted down the door.

486
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:45,810
You know.

487
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,490
I was like...

488
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,710
I killed a man to get here.

489
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:48,630
You're a ghost.

490
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,770
You can just phase through.

491
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,450
Like, that's the easiest answer you can say.

492
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,670
That's so boring.

493
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,850
This is wrestling to eat.

494
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,610
True.

495
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,010
Wait, you're right.

496
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,910
Sorry, you're right.

497
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,430
Murder is better than just phasing in.

498
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,270
You're so right.

499
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,070
Yeah!

500
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:14,050
Are you ready for the very first matchup of the day, Mint?

501
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,350
I am so ready.

502
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,610
Do you even remember what the first matchup was?

503
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,250
Uh, yeah, I do.

504
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:21,590
Yeah?

505
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,150
I was, uh...

506
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,390
Yeah?

507
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,350
It's Lime and it's Kai.

508
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,390
Am I right?

509
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,290
You're so right.

510
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,710
Wait, now we have to scoot back over here?

511
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,870
Give me a skip.

512
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,590
I told the guys to stay one.

513
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,530
We're experiencing some...

514
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,270
I totally like...

515
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,570
Oh, yeah, you need me to... hold on.

516
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,390
Yeah, I need you to move a little bit more.

517
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,170
I'm like phasing through.

518
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,550
I mean, you're a ghost.

519
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,550
It makes sense, you know?

520
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,210
Exactly.

521
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,270
You're a ghost.

522
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:05,670
Alright, why don't we drop by into the interview channel and hear the ladies out before our first game starts.

523
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,770
Why don't we...

524
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,390
Alright, I'll see you there in the interview room, Mint.

525
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:11,770
Alright.

526
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,790
Alright.

527
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,250
Hey, Juna.

528
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,330
Whoa.

529
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,230
Hello.

530
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:18,890
Hello.

531
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,770
Are you ready to interview the two girls?

532
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:22,510
Yes.

533
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,270
I'm not biased or anything.

534
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:24,990
Oh, yeah.

535
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,990
Who do you want to win?

536
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,450
I'm Lime.

537
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,530
Lime?

538
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,590
But isn't, like, Kai, like, in your same company?

539
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:32,770
Yeah.

540
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,170
No.

541
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,550
Oh, aren't they...

542
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,290
Oh, yeah, you should tell them to get over here.

543
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,410
That's your job, Juna.

544
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,270
That's the interviewer.

545
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,970
Oh, that's my job?

546
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,350
That's also your job, yeah.

547
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,530
Can I just, like...

548
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,070
I'll be right back.

549
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,510
Oh, sorry.

550
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,790
Nobody knows what they're doing here.

551
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,050
No one looks.

552
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,030
What kind of show are you running?

553
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,170
They're like volunteers, okay?

554
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,850
Nobody was...

555
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,730
You didn't even know what you were doing when we gave the instructions out.

556
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,550
You can't say that.

557
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,050
They're here.

558
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,670
They're here.

559
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,110
Welcome to Rootsy of Two Bands.

560
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,670
Let's go.

561
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,850
How do you feel?

562
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,690
How do you guys feel for your first match?

563
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,350
Oh, yeah.

564
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,030
Sorry, Juna, that's your first match.

565
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,430
That's your job.

566
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,910
Sorry, take a picture.

567
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,570
That's my job, ma'am.

568
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,190
Excuse me.

569
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,010
Sorry.

570
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,490
No, I'm sorry.

571
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,330
Hi, ladies!

572
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,910
As the first matchup of the day, how are you guys feeling?

573
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,750
I'm really hoping that it's a nice, quick match because, you know, it sucks to hurt people.

574
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,210
And also, I'm really sleepy, so I'd like to go to bed.

575
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,130
Oh, okay.

576
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,490
But this is... are you implying that you're gonna beat her quickly?

577
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,830
Bro, I can't speak.

578
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,370
I'm so sorry.

579
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,370
But are you implying that...

580
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,830
I'm gonna deliver like 500 kilograms of pain and then I'm gonna go to sleep.

581
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,510
Oh, damn.

582
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,990
Hi, what's your response to that?

583
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,610
My response is, listen, I know your games, alright?

584
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,650
You're gonna play nice.

585
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,230
And then you think that's gonna make me go easy on you?

586
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,770
Well, think again!

587
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:56,610
Alright?

588
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,950
Your name is Limu, alright?

589
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,430
I'm gonna take those limes, alright?

590
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,850
I'm gonna cut them in half and I'm gonna squirt them on your eyeballs.

591
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,030
And then I'm gonna take another lime and I'm gonna squirt them on my own eyeballs.

592
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,890
And then I'm gonna eat your ass.

593
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,010
You're gonna eat her ass?

594
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:10,770
No.

595
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,270
You're gonna eat her ass?

596
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,750
Wait, what?

597
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,450
You're free?

598
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,270
Beat!

599
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:15,850
Beat!

600
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,050
You're gonna eat her ass?

601
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,810
I heard eat.

602
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,650
She's gonna eat limes out.

603
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,110
I heard eat too.

604
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,390
Did you hear eat, Nix?

605
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,930
I heard eat.

606
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,250
I'm hungry now.

607
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,050
I mean, you can't simply flip up the competition by doing something so goddamn strange.

608
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,490
Let's go.

609
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,390
What?

610
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,170
You know what, baby?

611
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,910
That is the way to go.

612
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,810
Just do something so bizarre that your opponent is just so confused.

613
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,090
I've never heard of lime and ass as like a meal, you know?

614
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:40,650
Really?

615
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:40,970
I mean...

616
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,010
It's a delicacy.

617
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,190
I know what Mint's gonna do tonight.

618
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,590
She's giving her ideas.

619
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,970
She's giving her ideas.

620
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,790
Oh my god.

621
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,950
Don't act like you haven't tried it before, Dokie.

622
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,510
How did you know that?

623
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,240
Alright, ladies.

624
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,580
So, alright.

625
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,980
I guess we're gonna start the first match of the bracket.

626
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,740
Good luck to you two.

627
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,280
The loser will be back in the interview chair.

628
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:11,940
So...

629
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,580
So, and I believe Juno wishes to talk to Kai after.

630
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:15,980
Yeah, it's gonna be Kai.

631
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,400
So, we'll see.

632
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,540
Okay, fine.

633
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,040
We'll see.

634
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,640
We'll see.

635
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,240
Alright.

636
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
I love you, Buddha.

637
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,860
I love you, Buddha.

638
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,720
Alright, Mint and I are gonna go back to the casters' room.

639
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,260
We'll see you guys there in the ring.

640
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,200
Good luck to you, ladies.

641
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,460
Good luck.

642
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,440
Alright, let me swap to that game real quick.

643
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,120
Yeah.

644
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,440
We're definitely misaligned.

645
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,020
Oh, that's so beautiful.

646
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,000
Look, it's just, you know, day one.

647
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,360
Day two will be a lot better, we swear.

648
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,980
Guys, day two will be a lot better.

649
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,480
It's just, you know, it takes... there's like production stuff at the moment.

650
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,420
You know, while I was like... while I was like getting the wrestlers all together...

651
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,940
I cannot wait for you to see Axel's.

652
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,360
Axel's one is...

653
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,840
Oh, boy.

654
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,220
Okay.

655
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,720
Alright.

656
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,700
There was... wait, where's the intro?

657
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,700
No!

658
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,840
Guys, sorry.

659
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,560
Sorry.

660
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,620
Day one, scum.

661
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,280
They're so nervous, they just wanted to get fighting, you know?

662
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,660
Yeah, they just wanted to get straight into it.

663
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,200
We apologize.

664
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,100
Wait, what was the legendary move that you were waiting to see, Doki?

665
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,540
The legendary move?

666
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,080
Oh, yeah, the handy dandy.

667
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,200
Do you think we're gonna see... do you think we're gonna see it tonight?

668
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,940
We haven't seen the handy dandy in ten years.

669
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,460
Yes.

670
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,200
In ten years.

671
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,260
It's gonna be so interesting if they pull it out, guys.

672
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,700
I know.

673
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,180
It'll be a really special... special match.

674
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,360
A special match.

675
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,240
Oh, my God.

676
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,220
The illegal handy dandy move.

677
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,880
Wait, life's actually fucking over Kai right now.

678
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,040
I don't know what's going... it's like...

679
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,340
I don't know.

680
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,980
Wait, is this... is this what the ass-eating is like?

681
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,800
Is this...

682
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,060
She's delivering the lime juice.

683
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,780
Oh, true.

684
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,120
She's putting the lime juice inside.

685
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,040
Yeah.

686
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,660
Juicer, lime juicer.

687
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,500
Juicer.

688
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,520
Oh, my God.

689
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,900
She's bringing her up.

690
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,100
Jump, jump, jump.

691
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,380
Oh, already a pin?

692
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:33,680
Not yet.

693
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,060
Not yet.

694
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,780
Already?

695
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,640
Oh, oh, oh.

696
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,380
It's okay.

697
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,340
It was a... it was a... you know, a dominance thing.

698
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:41,920
Yeah, yeah.

699
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,440
It's just...

700
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,240
It's not over yet.

701
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:43,960
It's not over...

702
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,680
Oh, hey, there's the other casters over there.

703
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,740
Who cares about those guys?

704
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,420
Yeah, who cares about them?

705
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,540
This is... you pay for VTubers and we're giving you VTubers.

706
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,240
VTubers?

707
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,700
Yeah.

708
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,620
Oh, my God.

709
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,160
Lime threw her back into the ring already?

710
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,940
She's not done yet, though.

711
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,200
I'm really loving Kai's top.

712
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,060
Honestly, I know.

713
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,900
Where did she get that?

714
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,020
It's so magical.

715
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
I heard she makes her own clothes.

716
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,440
What?

717
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,980
Yeah.

718
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,160
I mean, it looks like she made it herself.

719
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,180
Is that a... I can't tell if that's a compliment or...

720
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,720
Oh, and a kick to the face.

721
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,440
Please.

722
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,120
She can't afford plastic surgery.

723
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,660
I mean, if...

724
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,960
If Lime wants the plastic surgery, she's gonna have to win.

725
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,580
Oh, that's true.

726
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,180
The champion belt includes five whole dollars as well.

727
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,320
So, she...

728
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,940
Whoa!

729
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,280
Five whole dollars!

730
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,200
Big money.

731
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,260
Big money over here.

732
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,060
Big money over here.

733
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,640
Big money.

734
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,740
Oh, that pin!

735
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,760
Oh, my God.

736
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:52,980
Okay.

737
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,840
They're leaving again.

738
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,220
Oh, they're leaving the... They're leaving?

739
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,840
Are they allowed to do that, Mint?

740
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,140
I think... I think... Well, they don't care.

741
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,480
I guess not.

742
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,160
They're just...

743
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,640
Maybe they heard you.

744
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,380
They were like...

745
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,200
Oh, my God.

746
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,160
And another flip from Lime.

747
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:15,120
I'm hoping to see Lime tear out Kai's chest hair.

748
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,240
Oh, that's true.

749
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,820
That's true.

750
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,780
She needs to shave.

751
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,620
Yeah.

752
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,540
Oh!

753
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,380
Pin!

754
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,680
Pin!

755
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:20,960
Pin!

756
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,300
Oh!

757
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,520
That's unfortunate.

758
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,800
Come on.

759
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,540
Get her ass!

760
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,700
Oh, my... Hey, do you remember that move?

761
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,720
That move is very familiar.

762
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,700
Oh, no.

763
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,360
Oh, no.

764
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,880
For some reason, I felt like I've seen that move before in a dream.

765
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:42,840
Are you... Are you...

766
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,280
Maybe you hit your head too many times because of it.

767
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,540
That's true.

768
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,980
What the fuck is she doing?

769
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,400
Oh!

770
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,260
Oh, my God!

771
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,900
Oh, my God!

772
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,420
What?

773
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,120
She's really dragging her up to the... into the middle there.

774
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,320
Why is she rotating her in the middle?

775
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,480
I don't know.

776
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,540
It just ended already.

777
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,720
They're just playing with each other.

778
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,880
They're just... They're just meals.

779
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,440
They're... They're each other's food.

780
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,980
It's like the appetizer.

781
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:10,820
Yeah.

782
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,860
Come on, juicer.

783
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,900
Come on.

784
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,080
Oh!

785
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,960
Wait.

786
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,840
Is Lime a furry?

787
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,660
She's had that tail on.

788
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,840
Look at that tail, though.

789
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,420
The panty shot.

790
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,880
We see where Mint's eyes are going to.

791
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,640
Hey.

792
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,080
Good thing you don't have an eye tracker.

793
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,100
That's so untrue.

794
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,640
Come on.

795
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,780
Oh, another flip.

796
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,440
They're feeling a little flippy.

797
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,300
They're feeling...

798
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,320
Okay.

799
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,000
Come on.

800
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,440
Come on.

801
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,280
End this right now.

802
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,940
Kai, come on.

803
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,580
It's so easy.

804
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,560
Look.

805
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,640
She broke her arm.

806
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:54,980
Oh.

807
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,540
It's ready for the pin.

808
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,040
One, two.

809
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,560
Oh, snap.

810
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Two.

811
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,080
Oh.

812
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,860
Guys, please.

813
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,700
Guys, come on.

814
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,840
You guys can't keep beating each other up, ladies.

815
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,380
I'm telling you.

816
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,220
They just like to play around with each other.

817
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,780
That's true.

818
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,240
It's like foreplay.

819
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,120
They're both sadists and masochists.

820
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,140
Giving the people what they want.

821
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,880
I think the people in the front row look kind of bored.

822
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,020
What's wrong with them?

823
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,460
Hey, get excited, people.

824
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,340
What's wrong with you?

825
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,560
What's wrong with you?

826
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,400
You got all the panty shots in the world.

827
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,360
Yeah.

828
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,860
What else do you want?

829
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,140
I don't know a good thing when they want it.

830
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,200
What the fuck is this?

831
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:41,940
What is going on?

832
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,360
What?

833
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,200
No.

834
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,020
We're casters.

835
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,460
We know exactly what that is.

836
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:46,900
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

837
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,900
That was...

838
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,880
You first.

839
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,860
It was totally...

840
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,740
It was totally...

841
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,740
The London Bridge.

842
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,060
The London Bridge.

843
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,260
The London Bridge.

844
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,280
The London Bridge is falling down, ladies and gentlemen.

845
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,400
But who will fall first?

846
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,480
Who will fall first?

847
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,020
Oh, hey, anyway, sponsored by GamerSubs down there.

848
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,680
Thank you, GamerSubs.

849
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,460
Thank you.

850
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,060
Gotta get that in there.

851
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,200
Use any GamerSubs code.

852
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,380
They've already paid for this.

853
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,180
Oh, my God.

854
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,040
Another bet?

855
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,760
Oh, wait.

856
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,680
Why did she stop?

857
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,260
I don't know.

858
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,800
Oh, she just...

859
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,400
What the hell?

860
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,320
She just like...

861
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,760
What the fuck?

862
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,440
Kai just took it.

863
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Kai just literally got in position to take that.

864
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,120
Yeah.

865
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,480
What is she doing?

866
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:50,880
What happened?

867
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,440
Why is she rotating her into the middle?

868
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,680
Get up, Kai.

869
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,840
This is not soccer.

870
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,540
Whoa.

871
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,240
Oh, my God.

872
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,560
That is a fancy flippin'.

873
00:38:59,560 --> 00:38:59,900
Oh, my God.

874
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,740
That is a fancy flippin'.

875
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,660
Okay, Lime, at this point, just come on.

876
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,420
Just end this.

877
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,420
Come on, Lime.

878
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,200
Stop dragging.

879
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,020
Just hover on top of her.

880
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,800
Get her down.

881
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,280
Lime, come on.

882
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,480
Choose her.

883
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,920
Oh, the finishing move.

884
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,720
Here it is.

885
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,240
No.

886
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,080
She missed.

887
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,960
How did you miss, Lime?

888
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,340
She was right there.

889
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,340
Kai was just regaining a little bit of energy, but...

890
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:24,880
Oh.

891
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,820
Oh, she's getting back up.

892
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,220
Oh, she's getting back up.

893
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,900
Oh, she's getting that energy from the crowd.

894
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,180
She's hyping everybody up.

895
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,320
Yeah, yeah.

896
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,180
It's like, give me your...

897
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,860
It's just like Dragon Ball, where you're like, give me your energy.

898
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,980
Give me your energy.

899
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,200
Raise your hands in the air and give me the energy.

900
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,840
Raise your hands, everybody.

901
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,460
Raise your hands.

902
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,380
One, two.

903
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:45,940
Oh, two.

904
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:46,840
Oh.

905
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,380
You didn't give enough energy and it's your fault, chat.

906
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,320
Oh, dang.

907
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,820
What the fuck?

908
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,100
That is not safe.

909
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,960
No, they could have hit her.

910
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,880
They could have hit someone outside the ring with that.

911
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,420
I know.

912
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,080
They don't care.

913
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,160
They don't.

914
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,080
They'd probably say, Tascaru.

915
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,440
Again.

916
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,120
Again.

917
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,040
We love seeing...

918
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,540
Yeah, hyping again.

919
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,560
We love seeing anime girls cry.

920
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,700
Do it again.

921
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,220
Suppress me again.

922
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,820
What the fuck?

923
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,160
Holy shit.

924
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,700
That swing.

925
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,300
They better get back in the ring soon, though.

926
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,500
Oh.

927
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,040
Yeah, yeah.

928
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,660
She's gonna leave.

929
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,180
She's gonna leave Kai out there.

930
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:24,980
Yeah.

931
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,460
Take her out and leave her down.

932
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,620
Six.

933
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,320
Oh, six.

934
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,480
Come on, mom.

935
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,020
We'll save her.

936
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,380
Come on, Kai.

937
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,660
Come on, Kai.

938
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:30,940
Come on, Kai.

939
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,580
Get back in the ring.

940
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,340
Are you really gonna get disqualified?

941
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,620
Okay.

942
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,060
Okay.

943
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,760
Oh.

944
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,320
Oh.

945
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:38,880
What?

946
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,120
Okay.

947
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,920
I mean, like...

948
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,380
That was like majestic.

949
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,040
I give that like a C.

950
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:42,780
Like...

951
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,280
I feel like I just watched like a cheerleading competition.

952
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:46,840
That's true.

953
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,520
Oh.

954
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,620
Wait a second.

955
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:55,960
Here's another pin.

956
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,620
Is that another pin?

957
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:56,880
Another pin.

958
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,720
Is this it?

959
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,060
Is this it?

960
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,460
Is this it?

961
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:58,580
Could it be?

962
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,040
Could it be?

963
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,500
Mom.

964
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,180
Ref, what are you doing?

965
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,520
Wait.

966
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,080
Alarm!

967
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,520
Oh.

968
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,080
Oh.

969
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,160
Here is your winner.

970
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,720
The juicy Lyme-alicious.

971
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,820
Yeah.

972
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,360
Thank you announcer!

973
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,820
Don't worry.

974
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,480
We're gonna turn on the intros later.

975
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,860
Oh, I think Lyme needs to go to the chiropractor.

976
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,220
She's okay.

977
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,500
Oh my god.

978
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,860
Lyme is the chiropractor.

979
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,840
Did you not see what we saw just then?

980
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,440
Yeah.

981
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,680
I guess it's a hidden talent.

982
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,980
Oh my god, she is the... yeah I feel like she's gonna get a lot of customers tonight after this.

983
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,220
That's for sure.

984
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,600
I think I should go.

985
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,060
I guess we're gonna go talk to the losers I guess.

986
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:51,000
Alright here, let's go to the interview stage and talk to the losers real quick.

987
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:56,550
Hello!

988
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,210
Hello!

989
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,170
Hello!

990
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,150
It's okay.

991
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,210
It's okay.

992
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,890
How'd it feel getting boggied to by Lymu like five times?

993
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,290
Girl, I tried.

994
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,830
And now I gotta take my ass to a fucking chiropractor.

995
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,030
Okay, you gotta admit, those are some fucking insane flips.

996
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,350
I'm sorry, that was ridiculous.

997
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,870
Like, how did you get that much like aerial fucking leverage bro?

998
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,590
I don't understand.

999
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,430
Are you a bird?

1000
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,110
It's ferret agility, don't worry about it, we got no bones.

1001
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,790
Wanna talk about your move?

1002
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,190
Oh god.

1003
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,530
I think I just like bounced three times and then like front flipped into her stomach.

1004
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:39,970
That was crazy.

1005
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,270
Oh yes please, describe what was going through your body.

1006
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,490
You broke my ribs!

1007
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:49,610
I liked all the moves specifically where it kinda just looked like I was giving you a nice stretch.

1008
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:56,230
It's like I'm sorry for kicking you in the face queen here, let me just quickly like you know, give your back a little bit of a stretch out, is that better?

1009
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:03,810
No no no, I would have rather you beat my ass instead of this fucking embarrassment dragging me around the ring.

1010
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,910
I couldn't lift you!

1011
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,850
Yeah you couldn't lift, you had to break my ribs, yeah that makes sense.

1012
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,070
You lost to a girl who couldn't even lift you, Kai.

1013
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:16,610
No.

1014
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:17,610
Wow.

1015
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:23,290
I tried, I tried to have a comeback, alright, but I guess this...

1016
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,310
Not all strength, agility too.

1017
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,950
Yeah, you kinda just put it all on strength there.

1018
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:33,790
I really did like the part though where I climbed up on the side of the ring and then tried to like pull you up to do something.

1019
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,050
And then kinda just gave up because you were too heavy.

1020
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,110
I've been bulking.

1021
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,290
I'm bulking, I'm bulking.

1022
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,090
I guess the whole thing is for you to stop bulking, Kai.

1023
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,030
That's the whole lesson.

1024
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:49,970
No, no, no, cut.

1025
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,190
Agile.

1026
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,170
Agile.

1027
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,350
More and more mass, it's harder for her to like, you know, carry me around, alright.

1028
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,950
Yeah, but then it's also harder for you to move your own limbs, Kai.

1029
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,370
But I have like protection?

1030
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:02,310
No.

1031
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:05,450
You definitely didn't have protection if your ribs were fucking broken.

1032
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:05,750
I think this is wrestling.

1033
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,290
You need to go to the bathroom.

1034
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,830
Stop, Suvo.

1035
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,190
Don't judge my ways, okay.

1036
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,370
There's a method to my madness.

1037
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,570
You guys just don't understand.

1038
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,230
Nobody understands me.

1039
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,810
Nobody gets me, man.

1040
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:22,130
Congratulations to Naimo for moving on to the next stage.

1041
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,050
Unfortunately, that means you're gonna be awake.

1042
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:25,070
Thank you.

1043
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:25,770
I didn't wanna sleep anyway.

1044
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:26,610
Yeah.

1045
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,010
Yippee.

1046
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:29,650
Yippee.

1047
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:29,810
Yippee.

1048
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,130
Yippee.

1049
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,470
I mean, you know what you wanna sleep when you can beat more ass, you know?

1050
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:35,170
Exactly.

1051
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:35,730
Yeah.

1052
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,250
Beat ass and eat ass.

1053
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,730
I couldn't sleep with all this adrenaline anyway.

1054
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:40,790
Exactly.

1055
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,590
I mean, you won, Lime.

1056
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,230
You won.

1057
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:43,810
Yeah.

1058
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:44,530
Yeah.

1059
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,130
I just have one request.

1060
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,210
What's that?

1061
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,570
If Rin wins, please kick her ass.

1062
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:50,970
Yes.

1063
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,390
Please.

1064
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:51,510
Yes.

1065
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,090
Please.

1066
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:52,650
Please.

1067
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:53,290
Please.

1068
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,630
My last request to you.

1069
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,850
I will do my very best.

1070
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,010
I will try to honor your dying request as you just lie on the ground.

1071
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:02,110
Please.

1072
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,350
With your face stomped and your balls crushed, I would like to...

1073
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:07,930
Whoa.

1074
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:08,830
All right.

1075
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:14,130
Lucky for you guys, Rin and Emma will be next in the bracket.

1076
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:14,730
Nice.

1077
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,250
You know what?

1078
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:21,890
We might as well just stay here in the interview room while the loser and the winner should leave, so we can drag in the other two ladies.

1079
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:22,470
Okay.

1080
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,010
All right.

1081
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:23,250
Okay.

1082
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:23,390
True.

1083
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,010
Just for convenience.

1084
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,510
We're behind schedule, guys.

1085
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:26,050
All right.

1086
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:26,210
Yeah.

1087
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:26,410
Yeah.

1088
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,110
That's all.

1089
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:27,730
All right.

1090
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,070
This way.

1091
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:28,410
Two, one.

1092
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:28,810
Good job.

1093
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,290
Yay!

1094
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,390
Let's go, kid.

1095
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,150
Thank you for being my very first loser.

1096
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:32,870
Congratulations.

1097
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:37,810
All right.

1098
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:42,630
Can we get Emma and Rin into the interview?

1099
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:43,370
Hello.

1100
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:43,710
Hello.

1101
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,190
Oh my God, the babies.

1102
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,850
Hello ladies.

1103
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:46,610
Hello.

1104
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,570
Wow.

1105
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,230
Hello.

1106
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:49,790
Hello.

1107
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:51,070
How do you guys feel?

1108
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,490
Where am I?

1109
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,290
How did I get here?

1110
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:55,630
We kidnapped you.

1111
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:56,550
Yeah.

1112
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,030
That's...

1113
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:06,030
I blacked out and then I opened my eyes and there's like blaring music and very bright lights and Juna Unagi for some reason so I'm a little bit discombobulated.

1114
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:07,490
Help.

1115
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,430
Welcome to my cave, Rin Penrose.

1116
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:13,970
You are going to defeat a final dungeon boss right now.

1117
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,530
I feel bad.

1118
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,710
Rin, I can give you advice on how to beat the final dungeon boss but...

1119
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:21,370
Oh no!

1120
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,070
Not that kind of advice!

1121
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,050
What is your information?

1122
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,110
What is this what I'm thinking?

1123
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,030
Not that kind of...

1124
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:29,890
I'm not thinking about it.

1125
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,410
Are we all thinking about it?

1126
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,610
Do you know about it?

1127
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,730
I don't know about it.

1128
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:36,870
I think... oh my goodness.

1129
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,650
Oh my god, you should have heard the table action go on here.

1130
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:40,670
Juna, what is it?

1131
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,350
Uh, Rin, you should deafen.

1132
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,370
You should deafen me.

1133
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,210
I feel like it's something I need to deafen for.

1134
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,050
Maybe it doesn't need to be said on live TV.

1135
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,730
The great thing is that this isn't TV.

1136
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,290
No, I gave you an out and everything!

1137
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:02,790
Well, let's just say Rin today is going to be raiding some dungeons tonight.

1138
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,610
I don't think any of that is going to be happening, personally.

1139
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,650
But, will the British be coming, you know?

1140
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,030
Oh, the British be coming!

1141
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,850
I think the British are going to be going straight into another raid, you guys.

1142
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:14,970
The British is coming, guys!

1143
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:19,730
Any smack talk?

1144
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,130
All I sense is confusedness and confusion.

1145
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,330
Is that shit-talking?

1146
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,350
If I wasn't scared before, I'm very scared now!

1147
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,090
Thank you!

1148
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:34,690
No, it's okay Rin, you can just show me your little sword over here.

1149
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,970
And sleep with me, I mean- What?

1150
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,130
Wait, she's a prince!

1151
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,110
She has a sword with her!

1152
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,290
You're a little prince, you have a sword with you, right?!

1153
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,550
I'm very confused.

1154
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,390
Rin!

1155
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:51,690
Rin!

1156
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:54,470
Rin!

1157
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,870
You have a sword!

1158
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:56,810
You have a sword!

1159
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,050
You wanted a bridge!

1160
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,350
You have a sword!

1161
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:00,990
Come on Rin!

1162
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,090
A sword!

1163
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,730
A sword!

1164
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,190
A freaking sword!

1165
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:07,050
A sword!

1166
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,190
What kind of sword am I talking about?

1167
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,570
Why is everyone yelling at me?

1168
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:17,550
Rin is just like this little confused boy at a supermarket.

1169
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,910
He's like, where's my mom?

1170
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,210
I'm scared!

1171
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,810
Your mom's with me, Rin.

1172
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,610
Oh, that'd be for Fasek.

1173
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,010
Oh, you always brought a favorite one, you unaki.

1174
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,070
Yes, I hope y'all duke it out.

1175
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,990
I honestly don't know who I want to win.

1176
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,230
Okay, no, Juna, consider, consider.

1177
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,550
If I win...

1178
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,110
Wait, shit, no, Kai lost.

1179
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:42,690
Never mind.

1180
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:43,150
Yeah.

1181
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,510
I was kind of hoping that I'd be able to face off against Kai, but you know what?

1182
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:49,390
It's okay.

1183
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,410
Next time.

1184
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,890
Are you just accepting it?

1185
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,050
She just gave up.

1186
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,630
Yeah, I was just like, are you guys just giving up?

1187
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,230
What is this?

1188
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,790
Come on, Rin.

1189
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,350
Where's the passion, Rin?

1190
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:02,650
Give us the passion!

1191
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,370
I'm gonna...

1192
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:06,730
Uh...

1193
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,950
She's British and has no emotion.

1194
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:11,690
I love this.

1195
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,970
I'm feeling it already.

1196
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:14,870
I'm feeling something.

1197
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:15,950
I feel something.

1198
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,870
It's okay, Rin.

1199
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,190
I'll eat fish and eat fish.

1200
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,510
I'll eat fish and chips with you after this, okay?

1201
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,790
Oh, in her dungeon?

1202
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:26,950
In her dungeon.

1203
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:28,910
No!

1204
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,950
It's just fish and chips.

1205
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,970
Good luck, ladies.

1206
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,090
We're now going to go back to the main stage.

1207
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:43,270
And we'll see who's gonna survive the dungeon raid.

1208
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:50,150
Back to the main cast is all.

1209
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,230
All right.

1210
00:49:55,650 --> 00:50:05,090
Let us... We have the votes and currently, Rin is actually winning the poll at the moment, which is very surprising after what we saw.

1211
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,610
In the interview.

1212
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,350
It's always the ones that are most timid though, you know?

1213
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,130
That's so true.

1214
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:11,630
They're hiding their power level.

1215
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:12,350
Exactly.

1216
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:13,730
Yeah, you're right.

1217
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:14,190
You're right.

1218
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,110
They're hiding their power level.

1219
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,550
Like you don't know what's going to happen.

1220
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,750
Don't worry, we have the intro this time around.

1221
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,190
I did not forget it.

1222
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,530
I apologize.

1223
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:30,050
Don't worry, Lime made it through so we can see Lime's intro later.

1224
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:31,670
Oh, true, true, true.

1225
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:33,650
So it'll be alright.

1226
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,770
Alright, we're starting the match.

1227
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,510
Emma's JonRenVTuber.

1228
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:49,110
I like how she has a green screen on so her fans could insert whatever they want down there.

1229
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,530
Or they could just have the body disappear.

1230
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,290
It's just a floating head.

1231
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:56,650
Yeah, that's true.

1232
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:04,410
The following contest is scheduled for one fall.

1233
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,030
Introducing first...

1234
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,580
Oh my gosh, this is a long intro.

1235
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,320
The long area.

1236
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,920
Someone's dilemma, Umia Emma!

1237
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,820
Oh my gosh, she has a crown!

1238
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,800
She's like royalty.

1239
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,080
The claws, the crown...

1240
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,640
Is that legal?

1241
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,420
Can she bring those claws to the ring?

1242
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,780
But you know, fancy getup gives you no tactical advantage whatsoever.

1243
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,560
But like, do you not see her hands?

1244
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,440
What do you mean?

1245
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,120
Stab her in the eye.

1246
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,520
That's what I'm saying!

1247
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,560
She can just stab her in the fucking eye.

1248
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,920
Ooh, your majesty, please come in.

1249
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,840
He is in perhaps the best shape of his career.

1250
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,620
Oh my god.

1251
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,020
I mean...

1252
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,920
Whoa, and a little bow for us?

1253
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:02,380
Your majesty!

1254
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,500
Your majesty, wow.

1255
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,960
No wonder so many people are coming into your dungeon.

1256
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,260
In more ways than one.

1257
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,980
I don't know what you mean by that.

1258
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,080
And introducing their opponents.

1259
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,320
Oh yeah, higher!

1260
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,400
Higher, this guy!

1261
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,660
Oh my god, that's so British.

1262
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:26,700
The Brit...

1263
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,380
I'm gonna win!

1264
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,800
Rint and Rose!

1265
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,920
I'm gonna win!

1266
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,220
This truly is the British are coming.

1267
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,360
The British are coming, everybody!

1268
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,080
I love how she brought like an inflatable duck with her.

1269
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,320
Like a little floaty.

1270
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:49,820
Yeah.

1271
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,140
That's gonna do anything with someone with sharp nails.

1272
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,180
Everything is glowing.

1273
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,040
I think they're like, you know, the real gamer, gamer wrestler over here.

1274
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,860
Wait, she also has a crown.

1275
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,240
Oh my god, it's gonna be like a wrestling wedding.

1276
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,820
The king and queen.

1277
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,540
I was thinking...

1278
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,920
Wait, what were you...

1279
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,020
A wedding?

1280
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,700
What?

1281
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,160
Yeah, like the royal wedding.

1282
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:17,840
Okay.

1283
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,140
Oh my god, wait, Rint is huge.

1284
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:21,920
How tall is she?

1285
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,860
Oh my god.

1286
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,720
Wait, oh shit, she's so tall.

1287
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,340
Oh my god.

1288
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,380
Oh my god.

1289
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,880
I will not help you in this.

1290
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,700
Vive la revolution, let's go.

1291
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
That's French.

1292
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,240
Wrong country.

1293
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,400
French is across the ocean.

1294
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,140
Okay, well, in...

1295
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,120
What do you mean across the ocean?

1296
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,140
It is technically across.

1297
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,580
It's the British look out into the ocean.

1298
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,640
Across from them is France.

1299
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,620
They're still connected by land though.

1300
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,480
No, they're not.

1301
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,280
British is a fucking island.

1302
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,280
They're on the...

1303
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,180
It's Europe.

1304
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,340
They're just the same continent.

1305
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,640
The UK is on the island.

1306
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,100
Do you not know the UK is on an...

1307
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,740
Is an island?

1308
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,820
Oh my god.

1309
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,520
Oh, wait, you're right.

1310
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,480
Bro!

1311
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,480
You know what?

1312
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,300
I shouldn't be surprised.

1313
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:31,980
You're in geography.

1314
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,280
I shouldn't be surprised.

1315
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,520
What do you mean by that?

1316
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,720
In Europe as well.

1317
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,160
I'm kidding.

1318
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,300
I'm kidding.

1319
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:38,600
I'm kidding.

1320
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,920
Oh yeah, you know all the flags in the world.

1321
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,400
This is why the British are losing.

1322
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,820
You didn't even know the UK was an island.

1323
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,780
Hey, I'm a ghost.

1324
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,960
I've been dead for so long.

1325
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,540
I only remember Panji.

1326
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,440
Oh, so you're right.

1327
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,820
The Teutonic plates happen.

1328
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,060
Things are shifting still.

1329
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,980
Things are still shifting.

1330
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,700
She lives in the past and the present, guys.

1331
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:06,940
Exactly.

1332
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Time has no concept to her.

1333
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,700
Oh my god, what?

1334
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,160
Wait!

1335
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,840
The British almost pinned her?

1336
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,940
Wait, why didn't Emma bring her claws?

1337
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,600
Like, it would be so easy.

1338
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,180
Oh my god!

1339
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:24,520
Oh my god!

1340
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,040
Oh my god!

1341
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:26,900
It hurts her heart!

1342
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,220
What?

1343
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:28,840
What?

1344
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,320
What?

1345
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,800
Oh, she's not stopping!

1346
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,960
She's just going at it!

1347
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,800
She's going at it!

1348
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,220
Yeah!

1349
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:33,900
Like crazy!

1350
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:34,500
Oh!

1351
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,620
Rin took some crazy hits there.

1352
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,380
I don't...

1353
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,520
I think like Rin chose the wrong dungeon.

1354
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,340
That's for sure.

1355
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,580
I think so too.

1356
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,040
I mean...

1357
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,220
It's a level 1 mafia versus level 99 mafia bonus.

1358
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,720
Level 1 grunt.

1359
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,460
Is this even legal?

1360
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,900
You're doing it out of the ring, ladies!

1361
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,400
Oh!

1362
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,260
Oh my god.

1363
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,160
She's just like beating her up outside the ring.

1364
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,060
She does not care.

1365
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:08,780
No.

1366
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,200
Oh, the stare.

1367
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,840
She's out for blood.

1368
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,240
Yeah.

1369
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,220
Inside.

1370
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,740
I'm surprised that like...

1371
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:18,040
Um...

1372
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:18,640
Surpri...

1373
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,600
Oh my...

1374
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,700
Okay, did you trip?

1375
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,100
But it was cool.

1376
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:22,600
It was cool.

1377
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,480
She just tripped on her own feet instead of a ball.

1378
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,360
It's so one-sided.

1379
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,060
What do you mean?

1380
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,600
We literally saw Rin get absolutely pulverized.

1381
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,520
Yeah.

1382
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,000
And now...

1383
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,940
Size is not everything.

1384
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,360
Yeah.

1385
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,000
Size is not...

1386
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,540
Somebody needs the agility.

1387
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:39,420
Yeah, exactly.

1388
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,240
Oh my god.

1389
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,800
Oh wait, already?

1390
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,220
So she's not ready?

1391
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,620
Someone quick CGI Rin right now.

1392
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,060
Oh.

1393
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,160
Oh, there's another pin.

1394
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:53,980
One!

1395
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:54,300
One!

1396
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:54,520
One!

1397
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,860
Two!

1398
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,100
Three!

1399
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,100
Three!

1400
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,740
And that is actually...

1401
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,360
Here is your winner.

1402
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,300
Someone's dilemma.

1403
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:07,500
Emma!

1404
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,640
Emma!

1405
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,360
Emma!

1406
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,780
Okay, that is sort of like really embarrassing though for...

1407
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,040
That was so fast.

1408
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:18,900
Yeah.

1409
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:19,760
What happened?

1410
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,540
The match before lasted like 20 years.

1411
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,840
But then the one with...

1412
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,540
Okay, so...

1413
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:31,160
You know the British are just, you know, their fighting style is too polite.

1414
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:31,880
I know.

1415
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,480
I think...

1416
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,160
I think they turned shooting.

1417
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,020
I think the Viva La Revolution sort of jinxed the whole thing.

1418
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,460
Do you want to try that again?

1419
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:42,990
Oh my god.

1420
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:46,130
Another idol member got wiped out.

1421
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:47,570
That's a little sad.

1422
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,510
I guess we gotta go to the interview stage to talk to...

1423
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:51,790
Okay.

1424
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:55,350
Yeah, let's see what Rin feels like about all of this.

1425
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:58,270
Oh.

1426
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:58,830
Oh.

1427
00:57:58,830 --> 00:57:59,170
Hello!

1428
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,570
That was the fastest match yet!

1429
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,710
That was the fa- This is the second match.

1430
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,610
That was the fastest one though!

1431
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,510
Rin, how did it feel?

1432
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:14,050
I don't- like, I saw you- Like, get off.

1433
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,470
I think we need an ambulance.

1434
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:24,770
If anyone out there can call, um, I don't know what it is in the UK, but it's 119- I have seven concussions!

1435
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:30,870
Sorry, I accidentally punched her too much because she's so funny with that green suit.

1436
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:31,650
I can't.

1437
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,150
I was snorting so hard.

1438
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,250
It was like when a bull sees red.

1439
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:40,350
You saw green and you just went- How many times do you have to punch me for it to stop?

1440
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:43,370
She was giving you CPR, Fanny.

1441
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:46,970
You know what they say, the taller they are, the harder they fall.

1442
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:53,830
So, Rin Penrose, how does it feel not being in the next match?

1443
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:54,330
Painful!

1444
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,210
I think my ribs are misaligned!

1445
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:03,310
I think, um, I mean that's part of the contract, you know, so...

1446
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,130
Yeah, honestly, you know what you are getting here.

1447
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,950
You just didn't read the fine print.

1448
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:16,310
I think, like, you know, when we saw you in the ring, we noticed that was not your accurate height there, so like, somebody was wearing heels there.

1449
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:17,710
Someone's like, John!

1450
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:19,090
John VTuber!

1451
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:24,090
Yeah, John VTuber, what are you doing wearing those high heels?

1452
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,890
In the wrestling match.

1453
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:29,510
Oh, I have no heels, I was just-

1454
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:36,390
Well, how did it feel beating up the Rin Penrose?

1455
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:39,810
Uh... good.

1456
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,610
I'm right here!

1457
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,690
I'm still in the room, you know!

1458
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:49,270
She does it so fast, I thought she could beat me harder, but...

1459
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,890
Oh my god!

1460
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:53,070
Oh, yeah, you thought she was gonna last longer, you know?

1461
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:53,750
Maybe because you're British, I guess.

1462
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,470
Damn it, uh...

1463
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,550
Every bone in my arms are broken, Emma!

1464
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:01,730
Yeah, because apparently, I thought British people are so powerful, can't believe you're that.

1465
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:05,910
Yeah, it's very- I am a small victim of you!

1466
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1467
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,550
Can we get a doctor up in here?

1468
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,090
Yeah, guys, can we get a doctor for- 999?

1469
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,130
For Rin and Rin?

1470
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,030
What are the numbers?

1471
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,210
What are the three numbers?

1472
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,370
What do they mean?

1473
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:19,970
What are the numbers?

1474
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:20,730
What do they mean?

1475
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:21,250
999?

1476
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,830
Oh my god, there's too many emergency numbers!

1477
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:29,850
966, 991, 996, and 99...

1478
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:36,710
Alright, congratulations to Emma for making it to the next round!

1479
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:43,970
Your opponent will be Lai Mu soon, after our next match.

1480
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:49,730
But anyway, we want to say thank you again to Emma and Rin for joining us.

1481
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,810
Rin, sadly, you're the second loser of the night.

1482
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,810
Another idol has been eliminated from the bracket.

1483
01:00:58,410 --> 01:00:59,790
Come on, idol girls!

1484
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:00,870
Come on, idol girls!

1485
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,150
So, we have actually one more idol girl, right?

1486
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:05,650
How many more?

1487
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,450
We have two idol girls left.

1488
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:11,550
So, we have Juna and Fuyo left to represent idols.

1489
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:15,010
So, I wonder if Fuyo will win against Snuffy later.

1490
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:16,610
I guess we'll find out and see.

1491
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,710
Anyway, we're gonna have to keep going.

1492
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,650
We're gonna kick you girls out and move on to the next pair.

1493
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,110
The biggest match of the night.

1494
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,250
Oh...

1495
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,310
Yes.

1496
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,150
Yeah!

1497
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,390
Oh yeah!

1498
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:31,150
The Meteor and the Dinosaur!

1499
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,790
Nana, kick his ass!

1500
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:34,250
Nana!

1501
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,750
Kick his ass!

1502
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,290
Thank you so much, guys!

1503
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,530
Alright, see you later, girls!

1504
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:44,310
Can we drag in the next two?

1505
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,550
Go get some help, Rin!

1506
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:46,710
Yeah, go get some help.

1507
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,210
Go get some help.

1508
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:50,850
She definitely needs it.

1509
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:52,810
I can't drag.

1510
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:55,230
Oh wait, I should give you...

1511
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,630
I should give you admin.

1512
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:56,930
Permissions, please!

1513
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:58,570
Please, please!

1514
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:01,690
I told you, day one is all about figuring stuff out, guys.

1515
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:02,770
I agree.

1516
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,050
I agree.

1517
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:07,970
Alright, you can ask them for now, but I'm gonna give you admin room.

1518
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,270
I did.

1519
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,110
Alright.

1520
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:11,410
Nana is saying, oh hot, good god.

1521
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:14,150
I think she's nervous.

1522
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,130
I think she's throwing up.

1523
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,670
Yeah, a little bit.

1524
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:18,390
She's throwing up.

1525
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:21,190
But she made... she mainly made like a diss track before.

1526
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:22,470
There we go.

1527
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:23,350
Oh my god.

1528
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,030
Nico!

1529
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,910
Oh!

1530
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:29,270
Hello, wrestlers!

1531
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:29,930
Hello!

1532
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:30,570
Hello!

1533
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:33,390
So, I've been seeing the beef on Twitter.

1534
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:34,850
Hello, hello!

1535
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:39,130
We finally talk face to face, Nana!

1536
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,410
Oh my fucking god, I just...

1537
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:45,430
I'm gonna just say it right now, you fucking dropped the diss track right before...

1538
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,390
Right before the actual match!

1539
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,370
How fucking good was that?

1540
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,710
What?

1541
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,450
Wait, it's been 65 million years, Gerard.

1542
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:56,630
How have I been doing getting pregnant, I hear?

1543
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:57,730
What?

1544
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,990
You've been doing your research.

1545
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:00,850
I see.

1546
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:02,570
The galaxy never disappoints.

1547
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,410
You've always been watching me.

1548
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:08,330
I know you have three children who live under a bridge with no mom, no dad, and you eat grime.

1549
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,510
That is none of your business!

1550
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,430
Keep your nose out of my life!

1551
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,770
You tried to ruin mine!

1552
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:13,870
Now get out of it!

1553
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,610
I'm trying to live peacefully here!

1554
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:16,230
Oh, you cry!

1555
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:17,230
Don't try to ruin it!

1556
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:18,130
Are you crying?

1557
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:20,010
I'm not crying.

1558
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,350
I'm trying to live.

1559
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,390
And I can't believe we're matched up.

1560
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,010
I just want to live, man.

1561
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:26,110
Like, what is this?

1562
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:26,990
This has got to be rigged.

1563
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,130
It has to be rigged.

1564
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,650
Why am I fighting you?

1565
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,510
I could have been fighting anyone else!

1566
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:32,850
Why am I fighting you?

1567
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:37,510
God damn it, I'm remembering traumatic experiences from my childhood.

1568
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:38,190
Ladies.

1569
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,730
I have a question for you.

1570
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:43,130
Mahogany or oak?

1571
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:44,830
Mahogany.

1572
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:46,330
Okay, good.

1573
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:47,230
That's going to be the coffin.

1574
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,570
I'm going to put you in six feet under.

1575
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:49,850
Oh, son of a bitch!

1576
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:53,810
Oh, no!

1577
01:03:56,110 --> 01:03:57,730
I can't bury you!

1578
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:58,790
You're literally the guy...

1579
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,250
I don't know how to make a comeback about that.

1580
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,510
I'll just try my best.

1581
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:03,990
Oh, my God!

1582
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:05,150
Holy fuck!

1583
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:06,170
Stop!

1584
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,450
I'm already dead!

1585
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:08,330
Stop!

1586
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,830
The match hasn't even started yet!

1587
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:10,750
He's crying, Chad!

1588
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:11,690
He's crying!

1589
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:13,730
Guys, guys.

1590
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:18,550
Please, this is the only means of me actually fighting back!

1591
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:19,370
Please!

1592
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,650
He needs the money from the tournament to pay for Calc's support.

1593
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:23,130
I need to win!

1594
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:26,970
I heard you have a diss track that you made about Gerard.

1595
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:28,370
Oh, yeah.

1596
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,350
Can you give us a little sneak peek?

1597
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:33,210
How many hours did it take you to make that?

1598
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:33,690
Holy shit.

1599
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:36,790
I made that song in ten hours since last night.

1600
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:37,070
Oh!

1601
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,230
That was last minute!

1602
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,530
That sounded so great, though!

1603
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:44,570
I thought that would take a day.

1604
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:44,810
Holy shit.

1605
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:45,030
Holy crap!

1606
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:46,410
Thank you!

1607
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,050
That's some pure fucking rage out there.

1608
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:50,350
What the fuck did I do to you?

1609
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:52,730
Why did you have to roast me like that?

1610
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,150
That wasn't necessary!

1611
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:57,650
Did you give us the acapella of the roast for us?

1612
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:58,350
The diss track?

1613
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:03,030
Oh, by the way, the beat is completely made custom.

1614
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,250
So you can play it.

1615
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,530
Wow!

1616
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,710
Oh, my God!

1617
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,310
Gerard, what the fuck were you doing?

1618
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,490
This is why the asteroid bites your chino.

1619
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,450
I know, like what the fuck?

1620
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:13,490
I got nothing.

1621
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:17,230
I was just starting beef and then I didn't know you'd be making a diss track.

1622
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,310
I didn't think that was a thing.

1623
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:19,730
Gerard, what were you doing?

1624
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,770
What were you doing, okay?

1625
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:25,410
While I was being born from the galaxy?

1626
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:26,370
I was trying to live!

1627
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:31,870
After that massacre on my family, you think I'd be doing something against the galaxy?

1628
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:32,590
Nothing!

1629
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,930
I'm just trying to live, prioritizing my own life!

1630
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:36,490
Pick it up.

1631
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:37,670
What were you doing?

1632
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,130
Pick it up.

1633
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:42,430
That's why she came back to finish the job, guys.

1634
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,970
She noticed Gerard was wasting his life.

1635
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:51,450
After the chance she gave him to live on, she noticed he was wasting his life.

1636
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,530
So she's coming back to finish the job.

1637
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:56,150
No, but I will be winning today.

1638
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:58,970
As the movie ends with me being the victor.

1639
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:02,250
Everyone dies, but not everyone lives their life.

1640
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:03,250
Everyone dies, but not everyone lives their life.

1641
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:03,610
Everyone dies, but not everyone lives their life.

1642
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:03,770
Everyone lives their life.

1643
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:08,250
We got some fucking wise words from the galaxy herself.

1644
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:09,090
We got some fucking wise words from the galaxy herself.

1645
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,230
I can't tell if you're praising me or you're pissing me.

1646
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:13,130
Pick a bunch!

1647
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,050
I feel like we've already picked it up.

1648
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,110
I mean, I can't help it.

1649
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,490
You dropped the disc.

1650
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:18,790
I can't help being humble.

1651
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,290
I gotta be humbled.

1652
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:21,310
Holy shit.

1653
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:23,450
I gotta put in some work.

1654
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:24,870
You did some good shit.

1655
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:26,490
Pick it up.

1656
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,190
I'm trying.

1657
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,350
My tiny arms can't.

1658
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:30,630
It's wailing.

1659
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:33,450
How much will you hold with it?

1660
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,990
I'm trying to pick it up.

1661
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:37,690
Ladies!

1662
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:38,390
Ladies!

1663
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:41,670
Take this to the ring, ladies.

1664
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,930
The polls are actually pretty surprisingly close.

1665
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:49,770
Nana actually only has a 57% of winning this match from the audience vote.

1666
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:53,530
So that's really crazy to see after Gerard getting his ass beat verbally.

1667
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:59,270
You may have cooked me in this drag section.

1668
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:00,650
In the beef section.

1669
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:04,190
But this time I'm gonna be putting you down in a real match.

1670
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,470
Nana, prepare your ass.

1671
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:07,710
You're so going down.

1672
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:10,630
Oh, God.

1673
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,590
Why are you dissing me?

1674
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:16,850
Stop speaking my language!

1675
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,070
It hurts even more!

1676
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:19,030
It hurts!

1677
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:19,930
See you in the ring!

1678
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:24,110
We're gonna join back the casters table now.

1679
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:27,490
Man, that shit was crazy though.

1680
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,110
Oh my God!

1681
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:33,810
That was like a beef worth a million years.

1682
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,870
Not gonna lie.

1683
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:39,110
I feel like I just watched Gerard turn into like, Gord.

1684
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:40,850
It was just under that pressure.

1685
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:41,330
I know.

1686
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:47,290
Like, honestly, I would be very surprised if Gerard managed to pull this off after what we saw today.

1687
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:53,350
I mean, even even Nana's guy... look at her, just giving salt bae.

1688
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:53,930
Yeah, right?

1689
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:54,330
Like, oh.

1690
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:55,330
The confidence.

1691
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:56,730
The burning expectations!

1692
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,190
Gerard's just like, I'm happy to be here.

1693
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,130
Gee willikers!

1694
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:04,170
Yeah!

1695
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:09,030
I mean, it could... everything could be lighting a fire under his butt.

1696
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:09,490
You know?

1697
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:10,370
Like... That's true.

1698
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,570
We don't know how he's gonna react.

1699
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,030
It's all...

1700
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,090
It's anyone's game.

1701
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:16,790
Yeah, yeah.

1702
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:21,930
I just... it feels like he's like, you know, it feels like he has suspenders on and he's like, Oh, geezer!

1703
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:23,770
I'm so happy!

1704
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,830
He just had a golden ticket to go to WIlliams.

1705
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:29,010
He's trying, he's like, golly geezer!

1706
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,890
I'm so happy to be here!

1707
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:34,030
I got the golden ticket to be in WrestleTubers!

1708
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:37,870
The following contest is scheduled for one fall!

1709
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,990
Introducing first!

1710
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:43,530
Who's it gonna be?

1711
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:45,910
Yes!

1712
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:46,870
Yes!

1713
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:48,910
It's Naaah!

1714
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:49,790
Naaaaah!

1715
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:52,790
Oh, she's back.

1716
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,130
She's back to finish.

1717
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:54,730
Oh my god!

1718
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,510
She's famous!

1719
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:58,830
I mean, the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs?

1720
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,610
That's a pretty famous asteroid.

1721
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:01,930
Not gonna lie.

1722
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:02,450
That is, that is.

1723
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:05,270
And also pretty old, so...

1724
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,230
Yeah, a hag.

1725
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:07,930
Kind of a hag, yeah.

1726
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:08,850
I thought you liked that.

1727
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:12,410
I mean, as one, I would hold.

1728
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,370
You gotta support your own kind, you know?

1729
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,390
It's self-love.

1730
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:24,590
You gotta support your own kind, man.

1731
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,490
You gotta send one of them over.

1732
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:30,950
Yeah, exactly.

1733
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:32,750
Introducing their opponent!

1734
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,950
Ooh.

1735
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:36,370
Ooh.

1736
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,370
Be painfully adored!

1737
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:40,990
Gerard T.

1738
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:43,370
Raxford!

1739
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:45,410
Raxford!

1740
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:45,730
What the...

1741
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:46,790
Whoa!

1742
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:48,970
He is definitely lost.

1743
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:52,390
He's like, this isn't the factor.

1744
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,090
Yeah!

1745
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:54,630
Where's my golden ticket?

1746
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:56,390
Where's Where's Willy Wonka?

1747
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:57,670
He's crawling!

1748
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:58,710
He's crawling!

1749
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,390
Like a wild animal!

1750
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:01,890
Oh my god!

1751
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:03,250
What a freak!

1752
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:07,630
I don't think T-Rex has used their front hand.

1753
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:09,890
Yeah, he's already doing it wrong.

1754
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:18,870
He's just like, where's Willy Wonka?

1755
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:24,250
Oh, oh, oh!

1756
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:27,370
Give us that pose, sir!

1757
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:27,830
Yeah!

1758
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:29,550
For the fans!

1759
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:31,430
I know!

1760
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:34,630
The last remaining dinosaur...

1761
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:35,870
Where did he get that?

1762
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:36,750
What the hell?

1763
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,070
He got a chainsaw!

1764
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:42,150
Who's the kiddie?

1765
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:44,390
Who let this man have a chainsaw?

1766
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:45,290
Pull this down!

1767
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:48,830
Oh, the pyrotechnics!

1768
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,530
Oh my god, he went all out!

1769
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:52,370
He went all out with this!

1770
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:55,390
Yeah, but a budget doesn't mean, you know, a brain.

1771
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:55,870
We'll see.

1772
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:56,470
Or the brawn.

1773
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:59,090
I mean, T-Rexes are known to have a tiny brain.

1774
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:00,010
They're like chickens.

1775
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,490
All birds have tiny brains.

1776
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:04,330
Mm-hmm.

1777
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,230
Yeah, I'm proof of that.

1778
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:07,410
We know!

1779
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:10,050
We know!

1780
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:10,890
Oh shit!

1781
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:14,310
The asteroids are already striking down!

1782
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:14,910
Whoa!

1783
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:18,410
Not a good start for Gerard.

1784
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:19,070
For sure.

1785
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:24,290
It's like she's taking... she's finishing the job what should have been done millions of years ago.

1786
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:24,970
I know.

1787
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:29,630
She wanted him to live a full life to remember all his bad...

1788
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:31,930
What the fuck is wrong with his neck?

1789
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:32,650
Oh my god.

1790
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,030
Did you see that?

1791
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:34,870
It was like a 180.

1792
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:40,050
Oh!

1793
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:42,570
Oh!

1794
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:44,670
He's gonna...

1795
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:45,350
He should pull his tail.

1796
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:46,610
Gerard, please.

1797
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,810
Do something, Gerard.

1798
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,650
Gerard, do something!

1799
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:51,270
Anything!

1800
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:54,310
Your family died for this!

1801
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:54,630
Oh!

1802
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:55,350
There we go!

1803
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:58,170
He was just playing it.

1804
01:11:58,190 --> 01:11:58,910
He was keeping it cool.

1805
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:01,210
He was thinking that she had the upper hand.

1806
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:02,190
He wanted...

1807
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:05,330
He's rigging the bets right now so more people will bet against him.

1808
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:05,970
Yeah.

1809
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,810
Yeah.

1810
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,510
Oh!

1811
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:10,210
Oh!

1812
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:10,370
Oh!

1813
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:10,790
Oh!

1814
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:11,150
There she goes.

1815
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:14,470
Hey, you almost hit the impostor and...

1816
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,110
announcers.

1817
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:15,550
Yeah.

1818
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:17,870
The...

1819
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:18,890
The extras.

1820
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:19,770
Yeah, the extras.

1821
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:22,810
The filthy flushies.

1822
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:31,610
Who invited the 3D people in a 2D tournament?

1823
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:32,430
Yeah!

1824
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:33,270
Yeah, yeah.

1825
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,770
Keeper anime.

1826
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:35,890
Get this out of here.

1827
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,350
Not anime leave!

1828
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:41,030
Alright.

1829
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:42,170
This seems like...

1830
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:42,470
Whoa!

1831
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,470
Where is she grabbing?

1832
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:47,410
HR?

1833
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:51,030
He is putting his hand somewhere that he should not be.

1834
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,290
It's kind of beautiful.

1835
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,550
Like a little princess carry.

1836
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:53,850
One, two!

1837
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:55,290
That's true.

1838
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,590
Do you want to be carried like that?

1839
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:58,370
Um... Nope.

1840
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,810
Do you want to be a princess?

1841
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:06,810
I'm the maid to the princess.

1842
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:09,650
Oh, so you'll do the carrying.

1843
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:10,370
I see.

1844
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:10,690
Yeah.

1845
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,230
You want to be the carrier.

1846
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,110
Oh my god.

1847
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:18,370
She's just watching him.

1848
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,310
Look, the crowd is going nuts.

1849
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,650
Several people are saying this is awesome.

1850
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:23,530
We love it.

1851
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:25,010
It is pretty awesome.

1852
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:26,630
Holy shit!

1853
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:27,730
What a pin!

1854
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:28,510
Wow!

1855
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:28,990
Wowee!

1856
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,110
Oh my god!

1857
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,000
Here is your winner!

1858
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,080
Yes!

1859
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,260
Yes!

1860
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,940
It's Naaaaaa Naaaaaa!

1861
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:44,800
Ohhhhhhh!

1862
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,620
That's just sad!

1863
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:50,600
Okay, gotta call bullshit!

1864
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:51,380
Bullshit!

1865
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:52,820
That never happened!

1866
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,020
What the fuck!

1867
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,480
I think you were enjoying that a little bit, Gerard!

1868
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,100
It was so fast!

1869
01:13:59,220 --> 01:13:59,780
Naaaaaa!

1870
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,460
All she did was just pinning it.

1871
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,220
Clap his ass!

1872
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,680
All over her.

1873
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,880
That was so embarrassing!

1874
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,960
Holy shit!

1875
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,080
Alright, let's talk to the loser real quick.

1876
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:12,760
Yeah.

1877
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,520
That was...

1878
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,720
I mean, what was he actually losing?

1879
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,360
Come on!

1880
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,620
I think it was...

1881
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,760
I think we just had to let him go at that point.

1882
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:23,780
It was just too much.

1883
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,020
And off to the interview stage we go.

1884
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:27,920
Alright.

1885
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,420
You're a fucking trooper.

1886
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,880
Bro, I put it on my actual...

1887
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,480
I put my actual statistics there!

1888
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,200
My height and everything!

1889
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,620
And I was fighting this big brawling dude!

1890
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:44,620
I didn't know!

1891
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:45,700
Oh.

1892
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,180
Oh my god.

1893
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,800
They say it was a candidate fit.

1894
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,180
Well, that was embarrassing.

1895
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,520
Well, this track is actually true now!

1896
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,260
I got buried!

1897
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,020
And that's the casket... Mahogany?

1898
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:55,600
Was it?

1899
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:57,160
God!

1900
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,740
Mahogany casket!

1901
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,420
Shout out to Gerard.

1902
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,860
Gerard was handicapped with pregnancy.

1903
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,820
I was fighting the galaxy, to be fair.

1904
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,240
I was fighting the galaxy.

1905
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,620
And it was like a huge power gap and...

1906
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:13,000
Okay, I give up.

1907
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,140
You literally had millions of years to prepare for it.

1908
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:16,760
Yeah!

1909
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,120
But I didn't think I'd be fighting in a wrestling match!

1910
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,820
I thought I'd be fighting it somewhere else!

1911
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:23,600
Where?

1912
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,480
Like where?

1913
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,780
I don't know a few million more years!

1914
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,020
I'm just 21 years old, okay?

1915
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,040
I don't know!

1916
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,080
You're a fetus dinosaur.

1917
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:33,820
What the fuck?

1918
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:34,180
Oh my gosh.

1919
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,260
I was fighting a galaxy.

1920
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,280
I was just a teeny little bit dinosaur.

1921
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,480
Shout out to Sorority for helping me build my absolute weapon.

1922
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,900
Even my fucking group!

1923
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,500
Even my fans!

1924
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,440
I love you!

1925
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,000
God loves you!

1926
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,880
And this is historically accurate.

1927
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,620
The last dino has been slain!

1928
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:54,280
Woo!

1929
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:56,620
No!

1930
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,960
No, no, no!

1931
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:58,980
No, no, no!

1932
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:03,500
Shut up!

1933
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:04,040
Shut up!

1934
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:10,220
Gerard, all I'm saying is that maybe you should have worked on a diss track.

1935
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,000
Yeah.

1936
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,660
That wouldn't help!

1937
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,280
That's not helping me with my fucking build!

1938
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:17,740
I thought it was crying ass!

1939
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:21,080
I literally was powered up by a diss track.

1940
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,560
You know, all I just want to say is that I'm satisfied.

1941
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,180
I don't even need a Windows game.

1942
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,020
I feel my life goal has been satisfied.

1943
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,600
Over the years I've carried 65 million years they've been settled.

1944
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,180
I'm at peace.

1945
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:37,760
I'm at zen.

1946
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,180
I've reached the end of my life.

1947
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,720
I'm fucking annoyed.

1948
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,460
I want to fight you again.

1949
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,400
I need a rematch right now.

1950
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,320
Yeah, I want to fight you again!

1951
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,200
Hurrah!

1952
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:50,560
Hurrah!

1953
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,240
Hurrah!

1954
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,020
I'll fight you right now!

1955
01:16:58,260 --> 01:16:58,560
Hurrah!

1956
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,120
Hurrah!

1957
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:00,980
Hurrah!

1958
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:01,720
Hurrah!

1959
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:01,940
Hurrah!

1960
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:02,780
Hurrah!

1961
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:03,420
I know where you live.

1962
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,480
Not my kids!

1963
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:04,960
They're watching!

1964
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,800
How do you know where you live?

1965
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,100
Are you a dog sitting in that fucking muscle chamber?

1966
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,780
Yeah, I know where you live.

1967
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:17,840
I would be surprised if she didn't know where I live.

1968
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,480
She's the fucking galaxy, fuck's sake.

1969
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:24,280
She just like fucking destroys the earth and be like, I know where you live.

1970
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:30,380
The day I killed the right family it changed his world.

1971
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,320
For me, it was a Tuesday.

1972
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,040
I'm already dead.

1973
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:37,940
I'm already defeated.

1974
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:38,780
Could you please stop?

1975
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:39,600
I'm already dead.

1976
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:40,920
I'm sorry.

1977
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:41,820
I'm sorry.

1978
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:42,660
I'm sorry.

1979
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,520
Alright, ladies, ladies.

1980
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:52,020
Go take this fight backstage because we're gonna be letting in the next set of fights.

1981
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:54,240
In bracket one.

1982
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,280
Yeah, but thank you.

1983
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,280
Thank you for having us.

1984
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:57,680
Thank you.

1985
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,340
Thank you, Doki.

1986
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,300
Thank you so much for organizing this.

1987
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:00,960
Thank you.

1988
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,180
Thank you.

1989
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,460
Thank you, Duna.

1990
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,700
You did it.

1991
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:06,480
I'm so happy for you.

1992
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:07,640
Bye bye.

1993
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,280
Bye bye, get out.

1994
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,820
Bye bye.

1995
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,060
Also, did you see the...

1996
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,000
Yeah, yeah, I changed it.

1997
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,820
Oh my god.

1998
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:20,580
Oh my god.

1999
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:21,740
Yeah.

2000
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:23,780
Do you like it?

2001
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:24,880
I love it.

2002
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:25,980
It's beautiful.

2003
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,760
Okay, the issue right now is that Snuffy is offline.

2004
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,480
So, I don't know if...

2005
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,460
I don't know if Snuffy is here right now.

2006
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,960
Can anyone impersonate Snuffy?

2007
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:43,760
Okay, we could go with Lime versus Emma for now until Snuffy appears.

2008
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,680
Snuffy is a little bit...

2009
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,860
We don't know where she is.

2010
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,840
Oh, but what about for like Fuyo?

2011
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:49,580
Fuyo?

2012
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,100
Oh.

2013
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,160
Okay.

2014
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:55,020
Is Fuyo okay with waiting until Snuffy appears before... Oh!

2015
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,960
I saw her on before.

2016
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:57,660
Yeah, I saw her on before.

2017
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,300
I saw her on.

2018
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,600
She's fucking dead.

2019
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:02,700
Where did you go?

2020
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:04,720
Where did you go?

2021
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:05,380
Wait, God, Snuffy!

2022
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:05,960
She's fine with waiting.

2023
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:06,860
She's fine with waiting.

2024
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,260
Okay, because of that, then we'll go with Lime versus Emma then.

2025
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,080
Okay.

2026
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,060
Okay.

2027
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,900
Please come back in, please.

2028
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,660
Oh my god.

2029
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,380
Fucking Emma is so huge.

2030
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,520
She like overtook them.

2031
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:28,100
Why didn't you make me size accurate?

2032
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,720
I'm actually seven foot tall.

2033
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,800
Oh, you're a fucking eel.

2034
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:32,840
You're not seven foot.

2035
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,300
Look at my wiki!

2036
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,720
Look at my wiki!

2037
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,660
I'm seven foot!

2038
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,200
Anybody can edit that wiki!

2039
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:43,660
I had a stream where I elongated to seven foot.

2040
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,900
Hello, Emma and Lime!

2041
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:45,660
Hello!

2042
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:46,440
Hi!

2043
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:47,640
Hello!

2044
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,020
How do you guys feel?

2045
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:50,440
Wow.

2046
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,300
Yeah, like, that was so... wow.

2047
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,420
I love the energy.

2048
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:54,660
Yeah, I know.

2049
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,400
It's okay.

2050
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,300
I had a small power nap between the lines.

2051
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:58,360
I'm feeling a little bit better.

2052
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:03,060
But I feel so funny the fact that we both want to lose but we both win.

2053
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,940
Now I don't know who's going to lose over here.

2054
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,480
She's like, wait, what's that bag?

2055
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,860
Oh no, wait, that didn't work.

2056
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,840
Who wants it more?

2057
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,820
Yeah, who wants it more out of you two guys?

2058
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:15,160
Emma wants it more.

2059
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,300
No, wait, I want it more!

2060
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:19,020
Oh, you wanna win now?

2061
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,660
You wanna win now, Lime?

2062
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,820
I thought you wanted to lose.

2063
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,280
No, I'm horribly competitive.

2064
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:27,920
Oh, oh my, I see.

2065
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:33,580
Can you not tell from the burning passion in my voice and how adrenaline-filled I sound right now?

2066
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,920
I'm just so fucking into it, dude.

2067
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,520
And you're like a natural.

2068
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:38,640
Oh, I see.

2069
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,760
Have you read the instructions on how to beat a dungeon boss?

2070
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:45,960
No, not the instructions!

2071
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,520
You didn't even hear this before, did we?

2072
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:52,480
Yeah, yeah, like, Min doesn't know what you're talking about.

2073
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:54,840
Like, we can never be able to figure it out.

2074
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:59,600
Well, I think, like, over 100k people know what I'm talking about.

2075
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:00,580
100k?

2076
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,780
Did 100k people raid your dungeon?

2077
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,060
What?

2078
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,400
But why would they know?

2079
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,320
I don't understand.

2080
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,380
Why would they know that?

2081
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,040
It's okay, for now only Lime can raid my dungeon.

2082
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:16,860
Right, Lime?

2083
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,120
You will raid my dungeon!

2084
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,300
Right, Lime?

2085
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:19,640
Hell yeah!

2086
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,320
Yeah, over and over again!

2087
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2088
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,360
Yeah, you can punch me in the face!

2089
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,280
You can stab for me!

2090
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,280
You can do whatever you want, Lime!

2091
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:28,560
Woah!

2092
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,400
She's a masochist, you got this.

2093
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,360
Natalie fuels her then!

2094
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,180
I'm gonna get demonetized!

2095
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,060
Well, it's on my channel, so...

2096
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,660
I'm gonna get you demonetized!

2097
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,620
I'm pretty used to it.

2098
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,040
I think you're ready to smash each other.

2099
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:51,700
Woah!

2100
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:54,300
Endgame!

2101
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:54,820
Endgame!

2102
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:55,860
Endgame, guys.

2103
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,940
Take all this aggression!

2104
01:21:58,960 --> 01:21:59,780
I need my London Bridge.

2105
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,220
Oh my god!

2106
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,440
Bring back the London Bridge!

2107
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:04,620
Bring back the London Bridge!

2108
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,560
It's falling down!

2109
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,280
Alright, ladies.

2110
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:15,360
Take all that aggression out on each other in the fucking ring!

2111
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:15,960
Was that aggression?

2112
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,140
Some people would call that aggression.

2113
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:20,500
On Bride and Loss?

2114
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:21,820
Woah!

2115
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,100
Good luck, ladies.

2116
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:31,480
We're gonna move to the main casting table now.

2117
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,160
I'm just standing over here!

2118
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,100
I'll see you guys there.

2119
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,060
Good luck, ladies.

2120
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:39,780
Good luck!

2121
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:46,200
Alright, I did not make the pull yet for this match.

2122
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,060
What are you doing, Davina?

2123
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:51,020
I was so busy listening to this conversation!

2124
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:51,300
You're a together!

2125
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:51,300
I was so busy listening to this conversation!

2126
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,640
It was so interesting!

2127
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:54,440
Were you not immersed?

2128
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,260
No, you were just fantasizing about raiding a dungeon.

2129
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,800
And what does that mean?

2130
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,340
Going on a grand journey.

2131
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,840
Finding treasure.

2132
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2133
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:10,680
That's it, right?

2134
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,140
And then becoming rich and famous.

2135
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,280
That's what raiding is.

2136
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:15,420
Yeah!

2137
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,620
Find someone else's stuff and you steal it.

2138
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,360
Yeah, steal their booty.

2139
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,140
Yeah!

2140
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,320
Yeah!

2141
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,760
What else could it be?

2142
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:27,900
Nah.

2143
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,480
Alright.

2144
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,440
Let's head over to Lymu versus Emma.

2145
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,000
Actually, I don't know.

2146
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:42,980
They both seem... both of them ended the other... well, Lymu actually had a real fight, to be fair.

2147
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,400
Yeah, Lymu I think has been the longest match so far.

2148
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,300
Yeah, the longest matchup we've seen so far.

2149
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,000
The others...

2150
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,220
not so much.

2151
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,880
I think she just got a little sleepy, but she said she had a match.

2152
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:53,720
I feel... yeah.

2153
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,480
But to be fair, they're like a natural.

2154
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:57,300
I think Lymu is a natural wrestler.

2155
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:57,980
Not gonna lie.

2156
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:58,480
I think so too.

2157
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:00,260
Emma...

2158
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,740
I mean, Emma fucking destroyed Rin.

2159
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,980
But like... but it was Rin, so...

2160
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:10,380
The following contest is scheduled for one fall!

2161
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,060
That is round two.

2162
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,120
Henshin is a first!

2163
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,700
Oh my gosh, she's so eepy!

2164
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,820
Eepy!

2165
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,660
What an eepy girl.

2166
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,200
She just woke up from a nap!

2167
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:26,300
She looks like she's like coming from Starbucks.

2168
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:29,080
The juiciest piece of fruit lime!

2169
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,400
Delicious!

2170
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:35,700
She's like, I'm just gonna wake up and then...

2171
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,440
Wake up and kick ass!

2172
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,060
Let's go!

2173
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,300
You know those like, white girl quotes?

2174
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:42,920
Like...

2175
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:50,080
Is that a sleeping bag or is that...

2176
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:50,860
It's a pillow!

2177
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,920
Oh, it's a pillow!

2178
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:53,840
Yeah, it's a pillow!

2179
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,700
Wow, this music is so like chill too.

2180
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,500
Yeah, it's like lo-fi.

2181
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:00,900
And she beat Kai.

2182
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:01,820
What was that?

2183
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,500
Coffee in her pillow.

2184
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:09,260
She's ready.

2185
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,300
She's ready.

2186
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:12,480
Introducing her opponent!

2187
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,220
Your majesty.

2188
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,080
She's someone's dilemma!

2189
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,460
Who's dilemma?

2190
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:22,040
Who's dilemma?

2191
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:24,940
Dilemma!

2192
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:26,580
Wow!

2193
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,140
Wow!

2194
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,880
Announcer, whose dilemma is she?

2195
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:34,020
Announcer, you never finished your question!

2196
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,100
Announcer, whose dilemma is she?

2197
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,120
We'll never find out.

2198
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:39,600
We'll never know.

2199
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:41,280
Whose dilemma she is.

2200
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,940
Oh, well she... I guess she's limes.

2201
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:45,880
Maybe, we'll see.

2202
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:46,460
We'll see.

2203
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,600
See, I mean... I don't understand why they can't...

2204
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,920
Well Lime's got endurance, you know?

2205
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,900
Lime was able to hold her own the whole time.

2206
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,520
That's true, that's true.

2207
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:57,940
Even when she was like an eepy baby, she was able to...

2208
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:00,280
I wish like, you know, WE actually...

2209
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,080
Call somebody an eepy baby.

2210
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,240
WWN over there!

2211
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,700
She was an eepy baby.

2212
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:11,000
Eepy baby.

2213
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:16,320
Lime needs a headset?

2214
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,060
Mint fucking crashed the event!

2215
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,640
She does not get a headset.

2216
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:19,760
Yeah, I don't have shit.

2217
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:21,440
I did not prepare a headset.

2218
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,700
Yeah, why don't you give me one?

2219
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,080
Yeah.

2220
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:27,980
This is MINE.

2221
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:28,640
I'm not supposed to be here.

2222
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,460
I'm here illegally.

2223
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,640
She's an illegal ghost, guys.

2224
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,060
We didn't summon you!

2225
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,500
Alright, let's go.

2226
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,680
Okay.

2227
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:42,660
Oh!

2228
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,540
What a hit!

2229
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,320
Starting out strong!

2230
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,320
And another hit too?

2231
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,740
Oh, she's just breaking her arm.

2232
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,280
Maybe she's too eepy.

2233
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,240
Yeah, she's too eepy!

2234
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:57,680
Oh my god!

2235
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:58,940
Not the arm!

2236
01:26:59,200 --> 01:26:59,800
Please!

2237
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:05,340
What's somebody think about her... How is she gonna drink her coffee without arms?

2238
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,160
Through a straw, I guess.

2239
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:09,740
Yeah...

2240
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,040
Coffee through a straw?

2241
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:15,680
Oh my god, I can't get enough of these panty shots.

2242
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,440
Mint, her chest is up there!

2243
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:23,780
Her tail is back there!

2244
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:30,540
Mint, you're gonna look at the panty shot when you have Emma's chest right there for you.

2245
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:34,560
I mean... that's true, that's true, but...

2246
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,820
I mean, have you not seen her measurements?

2247
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:38,480
It's more fun when it's flashed, you know?

2248
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,220
You just see it a little bit.

2249
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,960
I think we need HR training here.

2250
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,120
What is going on here?

2251
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:53,600
Is she just like, let me ponder your orb?

2252
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:54,420
Why?

2253
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:55,260
Whoa!

2254
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,120
Right in the gut!

2255
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,960
Oh my god!

2256
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:03,020
I don't know what she was doing measuring her cranium.

2257
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,840
Yeah, I needed...

2258
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,520
I needed to buy you a hat.

2259
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,860
Let me measure it.

2260
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,860
I don't have a ruler.

2261
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,760
I can't believe it.

2262
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,440
I've never...

2263
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:16,280
It's been 20 years since I saw the measure the cranium move.

2264
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:17,120
Oh my god.

2265
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,660
Sometimes I feel like it's a little useless, but...

2266
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:20,680
What do I know?

2267
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,620
I think it's like a power move.

2268
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:25,040
It's like to just show that you can do it.

2269
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:26,240
That's true.

2270
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:26,740
That's true.

2271
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,840
It doesn't do anything.

2272
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:28,960
You just can do it.

2273
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:30,140
One!

2274
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:31,180
Two!

2275
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:32,080
Oh!

2276
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,940
And Lime broke it!

2277
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,260
Lime's endurance is coming in clutch here.

2278
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:38,680
Yeah.

2279
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,420
She's doing so much work right now.

2280
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:44,880
She might be an EP baby, but she knows what she's doing.

2281
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:45,280
Yeah.

2282
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:49,320
I feel Emma is like very brutal, but she's going to tire herself out, you know?

2283
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:49,660
Yeah.

2284
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:54,900
Like, I mean, like, she clearly does not have long stamina unlike Lime.

2285
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,160
Oh my god.

2286
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,320
Oh my god.

2287
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,620
Oh my god.

2288
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,020
Just bring a knife while you're at it and shake it.

2289
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,680
That's true.

2290
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,640
Remind her of London.

2291
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,740
Take her back to her hometown.

2292
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,260
I see London.

2293
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,100
I see France.

2294
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,720
I see Lime who's underpants.

2295
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:31,160
And another stomp from Emma.

2296
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:31,980
Emma!

2297
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,000
Emma!

2298
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,580
What was the move that we were waiting for, Dokie?

2299
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,740
The handy dandy.

2300
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,140
The handy dandy.

2301
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,060
The tandy dandy.

2302
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,840
We've seen it once before in this event.

2303
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:47,340
It's been banned for ten years, but these ladies, they don't care about laws.

2304
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:48,680
Laws.

2305
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,780
Neither do we.

2306
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,540
Neither do we.

2307
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:52,840
Fuck him up!

2308
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,460
Yeah, bring him down!

2309
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:59,060
Just shake her!

2310
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:02,840
Where's the London Bridge?

2311
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,260
Oh, and the slam!

2312
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:05,880
Slam!

2313
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,360
And a kick to Jesus Christ.

2314
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,260
That's her back.

2315
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,340
And when you fuck your back up... Emma shows no mercy.

2316
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:15,680
Yeah, Emma doesn't care.

2317
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:16,540
Oh!

2318
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:18,060
Right on the head?

2319
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,540
Holy shit!

2320
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,060
Oh!

2321
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,780
She's giving us what we want.

2322
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,660
One, two!

2323
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,500
It's not over yet.

2324
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:26,860
Again, Gammu's endurance.

2325
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:27,420
Yeah.

2326
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:28,980
Gammu's like, no.

2327
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:29,660
No, no, no.

2328
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,980
We gotta show it again.

2329
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:31,280
Oh!

2330
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:31,740
A second time!

2331
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:32,520
One!

2332
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,140
One!

2333
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:33,840
Two!

2334
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:34,820
Oh!

2335
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:37,940
It's cause the cameraman gave us the wrong angle.

2336
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:38,580
You know?

2337
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:39,260
Yeah, that's so true.

2338
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:39,520
Yeah.

2339
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:40,960
They gotta do it again.

2340
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:43,760
Guys, guys, the cameraman does not know what he's doing.

2341
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:44,800
Like, we need a different angle.

2342
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,420
Oh my god!

2343
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:45,920
The grip!

2344
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,600
Wait, and then the reversal?

2345
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:49,200
And again!

2346
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:50,700
Another pin?

2347
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:51,380
One!

2348
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:52,120
Two!

2349
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:53,200
Three!

2350
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,000
Oh my god!

2351
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,840
Emma is out of control.

2352
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,520
Emma is out of control.

2353
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:02,980
She is like, obsessed with the dungeon raids.

2354
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,140
Here is your winner!

2355
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,600
The big dilemma!

2356
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:08,560
Emma!

2357
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:10,960
Oh!

2358
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,220
Look at her go.

2359
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,420
She's happy with another.

2360
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:17,240
She has absorbed another dungeon raider.

2361
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:19,000
Everybody's dilemma.

2362
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,760
Very good.

2363
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,240
Very good.

2364
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,440
I didn't realize we were raiding.

2365
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:28,900
Very good.

2366
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:29,960
Three stars.

2367
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:34,500
Let me put the wrestling app real quick.

2368
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,140
Three stars.

2369
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,300
Three stars.

2370
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,680
It could need a little bit more work, Emma.

2371
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:43,680
I feel like, you know, you should have positioned her in a better way so that the camera would get it.

2372
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:43,940
You know?

2373
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,000
Yeah, always know your angles.

2374
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:46,560
Come on.

2375
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:47,360
Yeah, exactly.

2376
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:52,700
I always know where the camera is facing, Emma, if you want a higher rating on the wrestling tuber app.

2377
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,000
Alright, let's go talk to the...

2378
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:00,630
Could have been better, you know?

2379
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:05,350
Alright, let's go talk to the ladies real quick.

2380
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:05,710
Alright.

2381
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:08,730
Yeah, you are.

2382
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:12,150
Hello!

2383
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:13,570
Welcome back!

2384
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:14,590
Congratulations!

2385
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:17,950
Lymu, how do you feel being able to sleep now?

2386
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:19,570
It's gonna be great.

2387
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:24,430
Like, I think maybe I should have had some extra caffeine and save the nap for after the match, but it's okay.

2388
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:25,970
Live and learn.

2389
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:28,850
You live and learn and then you get your skull crushed, but it's okay.

2390
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:32,490
Did you like, did you enjoy being, like, having your skull crushed by THE Emma?

2391
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,130
Yeah, no, it was really good.

2392
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:34,570
I'd do it again.

2393
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:35,770
Oh my god!

2394
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:36,590
Why?

2395
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:40,710
To be fair, you tried, you literally do it, like, several times, too.

2396
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:42,990
I just couldn't help myself.

2397
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:46,170
She keep getting stuff on, I feel so bad.

2398
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:47,590
I was like, stop, me, stop!

2399
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:49,450
It was consensual, don't worry.

2400
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:50,250
Yeah.

2401
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:52,350
Consensual, but she...

2402
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:52,950
It looks really me, actually.

2403
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:54,650
She just, she just an ego.

2404
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:56,350
She wanna go home and play Valorant.

2405
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:57,150
Oh gosh.

2406
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:58,530
I feel so bad.

2407
01:32:58,810 --> 01:32:59,210
No!

2408
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:06,970
So, so, LimeWu, how does it feel to lose against Emma?

2409
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:09,330
Sorry, Juno, you're supposed to say that.

2410
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:09,570
Honestly.

2411
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:12,870
Yeah, I said it, like, basically, because she wants to sleep.

2412
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,370
I mean, I can reword my answer, I guess.

2413
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:20,590
Say it again, but with different sentences.

2414
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:21,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2415
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:22,650
So we hope you didn't plagiarize.

2416
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:26,070
Yeah, no, no, it was honestly, it was honestly...

2417
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:26,330
It was honestly...

2418
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:29,410
It was honestly an honor to get stepped on by someone so tall and muscular.

2419
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:33,270
This is a video about Emma's Discord.

2420
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:34,250
Your Discord daddy.

2421
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:35,350
Yeah.

2422
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:37,030
Come here.

2423
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:39,090
Come here, little kitten.

2424
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:42,830
You have to listen to your daddy right now.

2425
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:47,630
It looks like this dungeon boss has conquered her own dungeon.

2426
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:48,830
Damn.

2427
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:49,630
Oh my god.

2428
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:52,450
We're like listening to this live.

2429
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:53,750
Yeah.

2430
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:54,430
Yeah.

2431
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,530
The roleplay goes crazy.

2432
01:33:57,950 --> 01:34:01,750
If you win the tournament, what will you do with your belt?

2433
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:03,750
Me?

2434
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:04,530
Yeah.

2435
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:05,850
If I win?

2436
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:06,530
Yeah.

2437
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:08,870
I will show it to my dad.

2438
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:09,890
This is like casting coach interview.

2439
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:11,130
And I'm gonna be so proud.

2440
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:17,750
Why do you keep being like so sultry with that?

2441
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:20,050
It's like, if you win your belt, why are you...

2442
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:21,150
It's my piece of...

2443
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:24,410
Emma, if you win, why are you doing this?

2444
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:30,930
Why are you so sultry with that?

2445
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,510
Emma, help me.

2446
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:42,670
I can't be...

2447
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:45,030
I guess we can't be together now, Juna.

2448
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:46,070
It's so dangerous.

2449
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:47,130
People are watching us.

2450
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:47,550
Yeah.

2451
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:52,050
We're just so sultry and deep-voiced and oh my god, are we gonna kiss and everything?

2452
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:52,750
That's crazy.

2453
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:52,950
People are just watching us.

2454
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:54,370
People are just watching us.

2455
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:56,470
It's like, oh my gosh, are we gonna do something on stage?

2456
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:57,510
Oh my god.

2457
01:34:57,670 --> 01:34:59,350
I think we need an after-hours.

2458
01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:03,570
I think we need an after-hours segment here for these guys.

2459
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:04,050
Yeah.

2460
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:04,070
Me.

2461
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:06,890
Oh my god.

2462
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,110
Congratulations on winning this match, Emma.

2463
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:11,370
You deserve some breakfast.

2464
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:12,990
Oh my gosh.

2465
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:14,670
I guess I am the final dungeon boss.

2466
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:18,110
Can't wait to meet my final opponent.

2467
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,550
Whoever you are, get ready.

2468
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:22,130
You're not gonna sleep after this.

2469
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:23,950
Your next opponent.

2470
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:28,250
Could be either Nana, Snuffy, or Fuyo.

2471
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:35,310
Unfortunately, Snuffy is still a little MIA, so we're gonna move on to bracket two until she appears.

2472
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:36,010
Oh, okay.

2473
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:36,750
Okay, okay.

2474
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:37,470
Oh no.

2475
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:38,410
Oh shit.

2476
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:48,150
So we'll make sure when she's back, we will go back to the match with her and Fuyo.

2477
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,530
So yeah.

2478
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:52,630
Anyway, I realize we're doing this live.

2479
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:56,050
Cause I realize I forgot to download Hakka's Wrestler.

2480
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:58,850
Oh my god.

2481
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:00,210
Oh no.

2482
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:03,810
I had everybody but Hakka's.

2483
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:05,830
I apologize, Hakka.

2484
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:10,110
Like I said, like this is the first time I organize WrestleTuber, guys.

2485
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:13,270
This is the very first WrestleTuber 2024.

2486
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:18,650
So of course there's gonna be a scuff along the way.

2487
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:22,610
And if I forget to download Hakka, it just has to be a little bit of a surprise.

2488
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:27,330
Just a little shock.

2489
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:29,730
The fish you write now is I'm trying to find Hakka.

2490
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:39,310
There's like 10 pages.

2491
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:40,130
Oh I found him.

2492
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:47,270
Oh wait.

2493
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:50,010
Am I next?

2494
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:51,350
No, you're not next.

2495
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,270
I'm just making the.

2496
01:36:52,270 --> 01:37:00,150
Alright, because we might as well roll in bracket number two, which is Anon and Nia.

2497
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:01,990
Bracket number two.

2498
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:03,930
My baby girls.

2499
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:04,950
Oh my gosh, that's my girls.

2500
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:08,310
Freeza fighting each other.

2501
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:12,110
For those who want to see bracket two, this is going to be bracket two, guys.

2502
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:16,910
Sayu, unfortunately, like I said, Sayu is going to be on day two because there was some delays.

2503
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:19,030
And so he won't be here for day one.

2504
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:22,930
So Luto and Sayu's match will be moved to day two, everybody.

2505
01:37:23,490 --> 01:37:27,330
So can we drag Anon and Nia to the...

2506
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:27,670
Yeah.

2507
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:30,230
Goodbye, Emma.

2508
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:31,590
Goodbye, Lionel.

2509
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:31,970
Bye-bye.

2510
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:34,230
See you guys again later.

2511
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:35,490
Bye-bye.

2512
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:37,290
Thank you, ladies.

2513
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:40,470
Nia.

2514
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:42,390
Hi.

2515
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:43,430
Hello.

2516
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:46,230
I've been seeing the beef on Twitter.

2517
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:47,650
Oh, yeah.

2518
01:37:47,650 --> 01:37:50,170
You're not on the screen yet.

2519
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:53,610
Oh, we're not there yet.

2520
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:54,950
You're not there yet.

2521
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:56,290
There's you.

2522
01:37:58,810 --> 01:37:59,890
Oh my gosh.

2523
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:00,310
I know.

2524
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,990
I know.

2525
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:02,290
It's just ahead.

2526
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:03,710
There's you.

2527
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:05,630
Okay, you're tiny here.

2528
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:07,490
Oh my gosh.

2529
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:11,010
Why is it just the head?

2530
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:13,330
Where did he go?

2531
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:14,510
What's with the recipe?

2532
01:38:15,010 --> 01:38:15,550
Sorry.

2533
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:16,550
Tight accurate.

2534
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:17,050
Okay.

2535
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:18,470
There we go.

2536
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:19,090
No, it's not.

2537
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:19,730
We're like the same height.

2538
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:21,210
That's how you act here.

2539
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:22,170
No, it's not.

2540
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:23,110
We're the same height.

2541
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:26,870
The more you complain, the tinier you get.

2542
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:28,130
No.

2543
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:28,870
Okay.

2544
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:29,370
I'm sorry.

2545
01:38:29,530 --> 01:38:29,930
I'm sorry.

2546
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:31,210
That's right.

2547
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:35,070
She's becoming chat.

2548
01:38:35,470 --> 01:38:35,950
No.

2549
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:37,290
It's okay.

2550
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:38,670
She knows her place now.

2551
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:39,430
She...

2552
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:40,830
I'm sorry.

2553
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:47,630
Well, to start off, I've been watching the beef between you guys on Twitter.com and I'm unsure whether this is a problem.

2554
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:50,330
I'm not sure if this is a brawl or like something else.

2555
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:50,770
I...

2556
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:52,050
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2557
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:54,630
Non wants to get choked and...

2558
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:57,510
I didn't know how to respond to that.

2559
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:00,050
This is the perfect place for that.

2560
01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:00,370
Whoa.

2561
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:00,770
That's true.

2562
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:01,350
That's true.

2563
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:02,350
Yeah.

2564
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:06,110
But she said please choke me, mommy, so...

2565
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:06,710
No, no, no.

2566
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:08,450
No matter what happens, I lose.

2567
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:09,870
Like, she wins either way.

2568
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:13,070
But you're not into that?

2569
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:14,510
That's...

2570
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:16,930
Maybe.

2571
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:17,490
Maybe.

2572
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:17,610
No.

2573
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:21,730
So you wouldn't choke your beloved... bunny?

2574
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:22,610
Yeah!

2575
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:23,070
Right?

2576
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:23,870
You hate her?

2577
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:24,370
You hate her?

2578
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:24,770
You hate her?

2579
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:26,310
Don't you hate me, please?

2580
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:28,750
Wait, wait, why?

2581
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:31,070
I don't know what the right answer is.

2582
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:33,350
What is the right answer?

2583
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:35,330
It's supposed to be a yes because he's so angry at me.

2584
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:38,410
I don't want you to have the satisfaction.

2585
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:39,490
Nooooo!

2586
01:39:40,910 --> 01:39:42,350
I'll blue ball you.

2587
01:39:42,830 --> 01:39:43,270
Whoa!

2588
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:43,810
Whoa!

2589
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:46,590
Can you blue me harder?

2590
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,490
That's fucked up.

2591
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:51,030
You know what?

2592
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:52,510
Maybe she deserves it.

2593
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:53,150
I'm scared.

2594
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:55,590
Is this wrestling?

2595
01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:56,450
I don't know.

2596
01:39:56,510 --> 01:39:57,210
I feel like...

2597
01:39:57,210 --> 01:39:58,950
I feel like there's something else.

2598
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:01,150
I think we're back on the casting couch.

2599
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:05,150
I feel like this is the casting couch now.

2600
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:13,250
I feel like there's some very strange tension in the air.

2601
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:15,170
I don't know if it's...

2602
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:17,510
sexual or...

2603
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:18,710
I'm unsure now.

2604
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:20,330
I don't know what to say.

2605
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:21,630
You did this, Juno.

2606
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:22,670
I did this!

2607
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:27,210
I asked him a question and he was like, please, I wanna get choked.

2608
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:29,590
Are you perpetuated?

2609
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:30,030
Yeah.

2610
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:32,850
Like a more sultry environment.

2611
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:34,130
No!

2612
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:35,770
It's my voice.

2613
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:36,070
Your sexy presence.

2614
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:42,210
Juno, I'm also open for you to choke me too.

2615
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:43,170
I'm not gonna choke you.

2616
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:46,110
So what are you gonna do in order to beat Nia?

2617
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:49,230
I'm going to lay there.

2618
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:53,770
Okay.

2619
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:57,230
I think you'll lose if you just lay there.

2620
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:00,550
If you're not moving for like X amount of seconds, you'll just lose.

2621
01:41:01,470 --> 01:41:02,670
How would that work?

2622
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:07,890
Maybe I can inflict passion into her.

2623
01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:08,730
Passion?

2624
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:12,410
You love to see the passion in the ring.

2625
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:13,030
Yeah.

2626
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:13,910
Oh, that's true.

2627
01:41:13,970 --> 01:41:15,750
Wrestling passion, right?

2628
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:16,450
Yeah.

2629
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:17,350
Exactly.

2630
01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:21,610
That's the passion we're looking for.

2631
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:23,810
Wow.

2632
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:25,290
I don't know.

2633
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:27,730
I don't...

2634
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:29,930
Nia, I wish you luck.

2635
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:33,170
I don't wanna really wish you luck.

2636
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,370
But I hope you do well.

2637
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:37,410
We're not supposed to be biased, Juno.

2638
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:39,230
You're part of the broadcast staff.

2639
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:40,990
I wish you both...

2640
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:41,490
Wait, no.

2641
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:43,350
I need all the support I can get.

2642
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:44,650
I'm biased.

2643
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:46,510
Look, you got this, girlies.

2644
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:47,230
Please win.

2645
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:48,490
Beat each other up.

2646
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:49,790
And choke each other.

2647
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:50,590
Yeah!

2648
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:52,370
Yeah!

2649
01:41:54,110 --> 01:41:55,950
Off we go, ladies.

2650
01:41:56,030 --> 01:41:57,550
We're gonna take that to the ring.

2651
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:59,330
That passion that we saw here.

2652
01:41:59,970 --> 01:42:01,090
Yeah, passion!

2653
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:03,730
Back to the casting table we go.

2654
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:05,230
Goodbye forever.

2655
01:42:05,570 --> 01:42:06,310
Goodbye, guys.

2656
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:07,070
Goodbye.

2657
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:08,670
Good luck.

2658
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:10,910
We believe in you.

2659
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:13,190
Wow.

2660
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:18,410
I just put out a poll and it seems like people really want Anna to win.

2661
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:20,810
It's the choking buff, you know?

2662
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:21,710
It's the choking...

2663
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:25,090
Do you speak from experience?

2664
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:27,730
No, no.

2665
01:42:29,150 --> 01:42:30,770
Why do you know so much...

2666
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:33,130
Wait, but why do you know so much about the choking buff?

2667
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:36,290
I just believe that, you know, I think that...

2668
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:44,390
I think anybody who is a masochist and is in wrestling, they experience the pain and it gives them a buff.

2669
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:46,250
That I know from experience.

2670
01:42:46,730 --> 01:42:47,890
Oh, okay.

2671
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:50,150
Oh, what the hell is that?

2672
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:53,250
Oh my god.

2673
01:42:58,130 --> 01:43:03,870
You know, the one type of wrestler that wants to be choked.

2674
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:10,350
The following contest is scheduled for one poll!

2675
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:14,310
Introducing first...

2676
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:17,030
Oh my god.

2677
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:21,210
Look at her ass.

2678
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:22,730
Oh, Nia!

2679
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,850
Naruto Itachi outfit.

2680
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:26,490
Yeah.

2681
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:30,190
I like how the background is like an Easter theme.

2682
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:31,090
Yeah.

2683
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:34,570
We can have like a view from the back too.

2684
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:37,930
I think there's a view everywhere.

2685
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:41,810
Oh my god.

2686
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:42,650
She has a rose.

2687
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:44,910
She has several roses with her.

2688
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:45,450
Yeah.

2689
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:47,690
She's so elegant.

2690
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:49,890
That's a word.

2691
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:53,090
Pose for us, girl.

2692
01:43:53,370 --> 01:43:53,970
Pose.

2693
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:56,690
She's so...

2694
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:56,890
What?

2695
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:58,050
You don't think she's beautiful?

2696
01:43:58,490 --> 01:43:59,550
I'm feeling...

2697
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:02,110
I'm feeling like Easter morning right now.

2698
01:44:02,370 --> 01:44:03,170
Oh my god.

2699
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:03,890
It's true.

2700
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:05,030
It's Easter, guys.

2701
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:10,410
Jesus has died for our sins and he's getting ready to be resurrected into that thing.

2702
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:11,290
Yeah.

2703
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:16,630
That's what you're gonna see on Sunday.

2704
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:19,570
Oh boy.

2705
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:20,610
Apologies.

2706
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:22,070
The last one was add-on.

2707
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:22,650
I'm sorry.

2708
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:23,630
I got the wrong card.

2709
01:44:24,070 --> 01:44:25,010
Introducing their opponent.

2710
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:29,370
Who's the opponent, sir?

2711
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:30,530
Who is it?

2712
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:31,190
Who's that?

2713
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:33,290
The real...

2714
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:38,150
NNAAYAAAAAH!!

2715
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:41,950
Wait, they're both furries.

2716
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,870
Look, they have like...

2717
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:47,770
WAHAAHAкамd She's so cool!!

2718
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:48,970
She needs business.

2719
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:50,090
Oh my God.

2720
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:51,010
She lost a tooth.

2721
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:51,790
She lost a tooth.

2722
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:56,930
Luckily veneers are in right now.

2723
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:59,230
Oh my God.

2724
01:44:59,310 --> 01:45:00,290
Look at her go.

2725
01:45:01,030 --> 01:45:03,510
She's out there getting those tax forms done.

2726
01:45:03,890 --> 01:45:04,650
Uh oh.

2727
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:09,530
I hope everything is all taken care of.

2728
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:12,590
You know, everything is signed properly.

2729
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:13,130
Yeah.

2730
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,390
Nothing done under the table.

2731
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:15,990
Tax fraud is not a joke.

2732
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:16,790
No.

2733
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:18,670
And she's here to prove it.

2734
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:20,590
Damn.

2735
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:21,070
Whoa.

2736
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:23,070
Oh my god.

2737
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:25,570
Some ladies just got pregnant just now.

2738
01:45:26,050 --> 01:45:27,150
Oh, was it you?

2739
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:34,910
No, it was Gerard.

2740
01:45:39,530 --> 01:45:42,670
Gerard's out there in the stands right now going, Nia!

2741
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:46,510
Please, I'm already dead.

2742
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:46,970
Please.

2743
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:48,590
I can hear him now.

2744
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:50,590
Hearing you chat out, Nia!

2745
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:51,330
Please!

2746
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:52,950
Yeah, I think I just heard him say it.

2747
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:53,350
Yeah!

2748
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:54,550
Yeah, come on Gerard!

2749
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:55,230
Say it again!

2750
01:45:55,770 --> 01:45:56,250
Nia!

2751
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:01,130
Please, the match is already over.

2752
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:03,910
Could you please just watch the different wrestlers, please?

2753
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:05,610
Wow!

2754
01:46:05,890 --> 01:46:06,850
Oh my god!

2755
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:11,450
The kick from Nia right off the fucking bat.

2756
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:15,010
I'm loving Nia's like Dorothy outfit right now.

2757
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:17,490
Oh yeah, she... we're not in Kansas anymore.

2758
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:18,390
Following the yellow brick road.

2759
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:23,710
Bro, what the... what did she do?

2760
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:25,530
But she is choking her.

2761
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:26,710
Wait a minute.

2762
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:28,050
Wait, wait, wait.

2763
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:29,530
Here's the wrong person getting choked.

2764
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:32,250
Yeah, you're supposed to get choked, Anna!

2765
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:35,950
Wait, Anna has like a fanny pack.

2766
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:36,710
Did you see that?

2767
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:38,030
She has...

2768
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:39,410
Wait, is it?

2769
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:40,590
Yeah, she has...

2770
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:40,930
No way.

2771
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:43,050
No, she has... Oh my god, it's London Bridge!

2772
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:44,250
London Bridge!

2773
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:45,990
She stole Limo's moon!

2774
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:46,530
I see London.

2775
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:47,610
I see France.

2776
01:46:48,030 --> 01:46:50,390
I see Nia's underpants.

2777
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:53,530
No, see, look, there's the fanny pack!

2778
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:54,670
Oh, I see it.

2779
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:55,490
I do see it, yeah.

2780
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:56,350
Oh my god.

2781
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:57,130
What do you have?

2782
01:46:57,130 --> 01:46:57,750
What do you have in there?

2783
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:58,950
Yeah, what is she hiding in there?

2784
01:46:59,270 --> 01:46:59,710
Yeah, Anna.

2785
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:01,090
What do you have?

2786
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:05,650
What do you call this move, Mint?

2787
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:08,730
Um, that's the Queen's Wave.

2788
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:13,970
I don't know why everything is British-themed.

2789
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:16,970
Oh my god!

2790
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:18,290
Is that...

2791
01:47:18,910 --> 01:47:20,690
Move over, King Charles!

2792
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:23,790
Queen Nia is here to take that throne!

2793
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:26,870
To be fair, it won't be that hard to do.

2794
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:27,830
He's very old.

2795
01:47:28,090 --> 01:47:28,910
Oh, yeah.

2796
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:35,910
I just realized she... Anna has a tattoo of her own face.

2797
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:37,970
Anna has a lot going on.

2798
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:39,150
I think it's, you know...

2799
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:40,510
What is she doing?

2800
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:42,450
Anna, please!

2801
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:43,570
Get up!

2802
01:47:45,730 --> 01:47:47,670
She's showing off... Oh, what the hell was that?

2803
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:48,650
What a miss!

2804
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:50,610
Anna, are you okay?

2805
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:53,530
I think both of these guys need glasses.

2806
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:54,330
What's going on here?

2807
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:54,650
Honestly, true.

2808
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:56,850
They definitely did not put on...

2809
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:58,010
the contacts, Mint.

2810
01:47:58,170 --> 01:47:58,390
No.

2811
01:47:58,850 --> 01:47:59,890
Not at all.

2812
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:01,990
Oh!

2813
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:03,550
What a slam!

2814
01:48:04,570 --> 01:48:05,690
Another slam!

2815
01:48:08,870 --> 01:48:11,930
And a kick to... They really like kicking each other's backs.

2816
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:13,210
Alright, come on.

2817
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:13,910
You can choke her.

2818
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:14,310
This is your moment.

2819
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:15,650
Yeah, this is choking moment.

2820
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:17,610
Peak choke moment.

2821
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:20,150
I call this walking the dog.

2822
01:48:30,450 --> 01:48:31,190
Clip it, chat.

2823
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:31,650
Clip it.

2824
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:32,350
She barked.

2825
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:33,750
No, no, no, no.

2826
01:48:34,610 --> 01:48:37,030
For free on my own channel?

2827
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:39,250
I see the views going up right now.

2828
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:44,550
We'll do anything for the views.

2829
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:47,690
For free?

2830
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:49,050
Oh, my gosh.

2831
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:50,830
Another stop on the face.

2832
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:53,630
Yeah, Nia's just not giving her the satisfaction of the choke.

2833
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:54,150
I know.

2834
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:56,490
Like, she ended up choking her.

2835
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,830
And so...

2836
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:57,010
Oh, she's dead.

2837
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:57,630
Oh!

2838
01:48:57,870 --> 01:48:58,470
A first hit!

2839
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:02,750
Okay, her face looks like the Grinch for like one second.

2840
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:04,070
Did you know that?

2841
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:10,010
But her heart is not growing.

2842
01:49:10,570 --> 01:49:13,090
Oh, it's definitely not the heart.

2843
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:18,070
It does not leave.

2844
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:18,730
Don't worry.

2845
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:22,330
What she's wearing right now does not need any imagination.

2846
01:49:24,030 --> 01:49:25,530
You know what I noticed?

2847
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:31,510
I noticed Nia is like a fusion between like her dog and like Dorothy and her dog.

2848
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:33,250
With a fucking R.

2849
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:33,950
A total?

2850
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,670
Yeah.

2851
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:35,930
The R's.

2852
01:49:36,050 --> 01:49:36,570
What?

2853
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:37,510
I don't know.

2854
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:40,420
Next thing.

2855
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:41,280
I don't know.

2856
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,060
Anyone who gets cocky is gonna get you.

2857
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:43,380
Yeah.

2858
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:45,940
Is gonna...

2859
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:46,820
Oh, wait.

2860
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:47,700
Not punished?

2861
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:49,880
Is she actually not gonna get punishment?

2862
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:52,160
They're at five, though.

2863
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:54,040
Oh, my God.

2864
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:54,240
Ew.

2865
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:55,080
Oh, my God.

2866
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:55,720
She like spit.

2867
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,040
Oh, my God.

2868
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,320
She like spit.

2869
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:58,520
Ladies, please.

2870
01:49:58,580 --> 01:49:59,980
This is not the bedroom, ladies.

2871
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:01,680
I feel bad for the janitor.

2872
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:02,680
That's true.

2873
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:04,880
Imagine having to clean all that.

2874
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:06,800
Like all the sweaty bodies, too.

2875
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:09,260
When Chat could just do it for free.

2876
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:14,390
Well, Chat.

2877
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,090
You wanna get hired today?

2878
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:19,410
It's a volunteer job, though.

2879
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:21,410
It's a volunteer job, Chat.

2880
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:22,470
Yeah.

2881
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:23,410
What?

2882
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:25,290
Not one?

2883
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:27,790
Because she was out of the ring.

2884
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:30,450
Nia doesn't know the fight and support.

2885
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:32,130
What the fuck is she doing?

2886
01:50:32,610 --> 01:50:32,690
Nia.

2887
01:50:32,690 --> 01:50:33,330
What is she doing?

2888
01:50:33,330 --> 01:50:35,290
Here is your winner by count out.

2889
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:37,970
It's Cat and...

2890
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:39,370
Anon!

2891
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:42,050
Oh, my God.

2892
01:50:42,450 --> 01:50:42,970
Nia.

2893
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:43,510
Wow.

2894
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:44,890
Nia did not know.

2895
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:45,570
What happened?

2896
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:46,970
What happened, Nia?

2897
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:48,910
The ring was right there.

2898
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:51,490
I mean, I feel like it was big enough, right?

2899
01:50:51,690 --> 01:50:52,150
Right.

2900
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:54,690
Like, it was there.

2901
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:57,710
Lackluster of a moment.

2902
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:57,770
Yeah.

2903
01:50:57,770 --> 01:50:57,890
I don't know.

2904
01:50:59,150 --> 01:50:59,670
Wait.

2905
01:50:59,670 --> 01:51:01,470
Her face is on her nose.

2906
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:02,450
Did you see that?

2907
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:04,530
Oh, that's what that is?

2908
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:04,950
Yeah.

2909
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:06,570
That's her face on the nose.

2910
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:11,210
I'm loving this dream work space we've got going on here.

2911
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:11,290
Yeah.

2912
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:11,530
That's true.

2913
01:51:11,850 --> 01:51:12,810
Very... You know what?

2914
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:13,690
That's true.

2915
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:15,710
We got the Bee movie right here.

2916
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:16,910
Bee movie at home.

2917
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:19,250
This is the whole Bee.

2918
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:19,910
Yeah.

2919
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:21,330
That's the whole Bee.

2920
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:25,750
Let's talk to the ladies and see what they think.

2921
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:26,670
Let's talk.

2922
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:29,970
Oh, no.

2923
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:31,310
Hit me away from this woman!

2924
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:33,350
Hit me away from her!

2925
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:35,590
You should have hit me harder, Nia!

2926
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:37,730
It wasn't enough for me.

2927
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:39,790
Look at her!

2928
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:42,030
How was I gonna beat that thing?

2929
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:44,250
She literally beat the kid up.

2930
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:53,230
She's out to seek tougher matches, someone who will just cause her pain.

2931
01:51:54,630 --> 01:51:55,910
Nia, in her defense.

2932
01:51:56,010 --> 01:51:57,750
She did explain what she was going to bring.

2933
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:05,790
I don't know how I didn't win.

2934
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:11,710
You could have hit me a bit harder, you know?

2935
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:12,910
I wasn't feeling it.

2936
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:14,710
I'm sorry, I wasn't hurting you.

2937
01:52:14,710 --> 01:52:18,530
To be fair, she literally waited for you to get back to the ring to hit her again.

2938
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:20,050
So that's just embarrassing.

2939
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:24,070
I have bad stamina, alright.

2940
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:25,590
I'm a couch potato.

2941
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:27,090
You're a couch potato?

2942
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:27,490
How long?

2943
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:28,050
Bears wear me out.

2944
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:29,290
So, how old are you?

2945
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:31,310
How long were you prepping for this tournament though?

2946
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:33,810
I would assume like, at least two weeks.

2947
01:52:35,390 --> 01:52:36,850
Yeah, you know, I...

2948
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:39,010
There was no catnip involved at all.

2949
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:40,090
I wasn't just chilling.

2950
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:41,530
You're not clean?

2951
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:43,950
You're not clean?

2952
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:46,110
No, no, no, I am!

2953
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:48,450
You're not clean?

2954
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:48,630
Oh my god.

2955
01:52:48,630 --> 01:52:49,870
I took my test.

2956
01:52:50,110 --> 01:52:50,790
I'm qualified.

2957
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:52,230
Okay, alright.

2958
01:52:52,910 --> 01:52:54,270
I mean, it doesn't really matter.

2959
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:55,550
She's already eliminated.

2960
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:56,410
Oh my god.

2961
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:00,630
There might have been some B-grade catnip right there.

2962
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:02,490
I don't know where your dealer was.

2963
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:06,310
Yeah, you might want to find someone else.

2964
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:09,250
Yeah, you might, you know, I hear, you know, I know somebody.

2965
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:09,770
You know?

2966
01:53:10,170 --> 01:53:10,610
Huh?

2967
01:53:10,690 --> 01:53:11,890
Yeah, I know somebody.

2968
01:53:11,950 --> 01:53:12,310
You know somebody?

2969
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:14,350
And she's like, maybe right here in this room.

2970
01:53:14,610 --> 01:53:17,070
And I know she has a lot of catnip.

2971
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:18,730
Bright mint.

2972
01:53:20,070 --> 01:53:20,850
I agree!

2973
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:23,550
You have a cat!

2974
01:53:25,150 --> 01:53:26,030
Oh, you're right.

2975
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:26,470
I do.

2976
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:28,490
Do you not have catnip?

2977
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:30,920
I do!

2978
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:32,220
Cat, come to me.

2979
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:32,960
Come to me now.

2980
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:33,920
I'll hook you up.

2981
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,460
Thank you.

2982
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:37,640
Hold on.

2983
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:38,680
Did you...

2984
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:40,720
I forgot what I was gonna say.

2985
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:42,500
I can't make it sound weird.

2986
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:44,440
No, no, no.

2987
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:46,680
Were you satisfied after this match?

2988
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,220
Or are you longing for more?

2989
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,360
I'm longing for more, mommy.

2990
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:51,140
You're longing for more?

2991
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:52,040
Woah!

2992
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:56,880
Ladies...

2993
01:53:57,580 --> 01:54:00,980
Now I'm wondering if it was a mistake to have you as an interviewer.

2994
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:01,620
No!

2995
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:07,520
Listen, listen.

2996
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:09,920
Well, non-congratulations.

2997
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:16,720
I hope... I'm assuming that each tattoo you have on your body is each win that you have obtained in your career.

2998
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,300
So where will your next tattoo go?

2999
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:22,080
Oh, that's where I want them to hit me.

3000
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:25,320
I'll put more on my body.

3001
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:27,300
You know where?

3002
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:29,460
Oh yeah, on my neck.

3003
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:34,140
Oh, I also have hand tattoos on my neck too to show that where to choke me.

3004
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,160
Oh, you know, you make it to day two.

3005
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:38,940
You can easily edit, you know.

3006
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,540
You can add that tattoo before day two comes on.

3007
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,880
Call up your tattoo parlor and add that.

3008
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:47,300
I'll call them right now.

3009
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:50,120
That's some good confidence.

3010
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:51,100
Yeah, that's...

3011
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:53,920
We won...

3012
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:56,640
I mean, if you win, you make it to day two, Anna.

3013
01:54:58,700 --> 01:54:59,220
Alright.

3014
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:00,960
Okay, I'll try my best.

3015
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:01,880
Whose dog was that?

3016
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:03,360
Oh, my bad.

3017
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:03,920
Sorry.

3018
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:06,860
I thought it was you, Dokie.

3019
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:10,720
Alright, guys.

3020
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:15,960
It's off to the next matchup with Juna and Haka.

3021
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,040
Is Haka actually here though?

3022
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:18,780
Like, is he...

3023
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:20,380
So, okay, I...

3024
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:22,120
Wait, Haka's online.

3025
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:22,860
I see Haka.

3026
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:25,500
He's here, but he's not really here.

3027
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:26,460
He told me.

3028
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:28,020
He's taking a shit.

3029
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:29,200
Oh, okay.

3030
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:29,640
Oh!

3031
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:32,680
Alright.

3032
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:34,580
Wow.

3033
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:37,520
Exposing Haka off the bat.

3034
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:38,500
Okay.

3035
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:40,700
Hey, Haka.

3036
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:42,560
We got some TMI just here.

3037
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:44,580
Is this from the bathroom?

3038
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:47,100
Yeah, are you like in the bathroom, Haka?

3039
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,500
Like, what the fuck?

3040
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:51,360
No, I literally just got out.

3041
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:51,680
Okay?

3042
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:52,280
I literally...

3043
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,460
You just got out.

3044
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:56,080
Like, what's going on?

3045
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:56,640
Can you repeat that?

3046
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:57,960
My ears can't register.

3047
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:59,280
Like, such a high-pitched voice.

3048
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:00,680
Whoa.

3049
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:01,580
What are you talking about?

3050
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:03,260
What the fuck do you mean high-pitched voice?

3051
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:03,560
Hello?

3052
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:04,800
It's so high.

3053
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:05,640
Oh my god, bro.

3054
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:07,260
The wavelengths, bro.

3055
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:07,800
I can't...

3056
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:09,140
You're so short too.

3057
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:09,740
Holy shit.

3058
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:10,660
Damn.

3059
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:13,440
I literally told you, hold up.

3060
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:14,240
I'm taking a shit.

3061
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:16,920
And then I took a shit and I was like, okay, ping me.

3062
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:18,360
Was it a nervous shit?

3063
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:19,780
Is that why you had a shit?

3064
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:21,040
Oh yeah, absolutely.

3065
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:22,420
When you're in a...

3066
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:29,780
in a wrestling competition with, you know, fighting a fucking eel, you kind of have to like, you know, empty out the tank.

3067
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:30,560
Yeah, why?

3068
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:31,760
Because you're gonna be fucking over.

3069
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:33,340
You're gonna be fucking over when I'm done with you.

3070
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:34,460
Did you wash your hands?

3071
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:35,540
Yeah, did you wash your hands?

3072
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:37,280
By the way, you just got out.

3073
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:40,540
Whoa, give me a sec.

3074
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:41,000
I need to move.

3075
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:43,640
I washed my hands like fucking medical style.

3076
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:44,780
You know, like off to the fucking elbow.

3077
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:45,120
Medical style?

3078
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:46,560
Yeah.

3079
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:47,800
What does that even mean?

3080
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:49,900
You should have kept them dirty.

3081
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:50,120
Medical style?

3082
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:51,420
Grossed her out a little.

3083
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:56,440
No, because I don't want to give her like, you know, like poison damage over time.

3084
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:57,360
Poison damage?

3085
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,800
It's all about like physical, like, you know, punching over here.

3086
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:01,100
Yeah.

3087
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:03,980
Wait, I thought like birds eat eels.

3088
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,060
He's a tiny bird.

3089
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,240
Yeah, I'm kidding.

3090
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:11,000
Okay, to be fair, he is pretty tiny.

3091
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,760
My tail is as tall as him.

3092
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:15,540
You have to understand.

3093
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,160
Sorry, this is the accurate height.

3094
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:17,680
I'm sorry.

3095
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,440
This is the accurate.

3096
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:20,880
Yeah.

3097
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:24,060
Sigh.

3098
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:24,920
Yeah.

3099
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:32,820
Oh, so who Who the fuck mirrored me in the announcement?

3100
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:34,580
Why am I mirrored?

3101
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:35,960
Why is my hair the other side?

3102
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:36,640
Why am I awkward?

3103
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:39,800
Look, it's all they have to match.

3104
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:41,580
Yeah.

3105
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:45,840
Really look at that and I was just like, whoa.

3106
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:47,920
That's not me.

3107
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:52,520
I hope we have a good fight.

3108
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:55,300
I don't know if I'll win, but I'll try my best.

3109
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:57,160
Where's the confidence?

3110
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,180
It has to be a fair fight.

3111
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:02,080
You know, we have to abide by the rules of nature.

3112
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:03,680
Oh, you're right.

3113
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:04,960
Predator versus predator.

3114
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:05,980
Yeah.

3115
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:08,360
What's the rules of nature?

3116
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:09,760
Wait, but you're both predators.

3117
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:10,980
Survival of the fittest.

3118
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:12,380
Who's gonna win?

3119
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:13,340
Me.

3120
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:17,360
I'm kidding.

3121
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:17,960
I'm kidding.

3122
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:21,540
We saw what happened to the dinosaurs.

3123
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:23,100
Did you already show them my gladiator?

3124
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:24,600
You show them my gladiator?

3125
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:25,760
What's the gladiator?

3126
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,360
Bro, my fucking fighter is built as hell.

3127
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:31,440
Is he short though?

3128
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,460
Is he like short stock?

3129
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:33,640
Nah, man.

3130
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:35,300
He's fucking huge.

3131
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:36,520
He's fucking huge.

3132
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:37,800
It's huge.

3133
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:42,480
Haka, what do you mean he?

3134
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:43,400
It's you.

3135
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:45,300
Oh.

3136
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:48,740
I like you.

3137
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:49,220
I like you.

3138
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:50,280
Oh.

3139
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:52,880
Wow.

3140
01:58:53,920 --> 01:59:02,600
Well, you see, when you're a performer, you kind of have to find, you know, different options and that guy just looked at me funny and I was just like, hey, you wanna make 20 bucks?

3141
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:05,860
Already admitting to fraud?

3142
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:09,180
You should be confessing after the match, Haka.

3143
01:59:09,620 --> 01:59:12,280
So when you lose, you can be like, that wasn't me anyway.

3144
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:13,940
No, no, no, no, no.

3145
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:14,540
I'm honest.

3146
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,020
I'm honest.

3147
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:16,920
That's the cool thing about being an idol.

3148
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:17,740
You have to be honest.

3149
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:18,140
Yeah.

3150
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:19,900
Okay.

3151
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,920
As honest as I am that I took a shit before this.

3152
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:27,040
Wow.

3153
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,360
Alright, well, we'll see.

3154
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:31,200
We'll see how you do in the match, Haka.

3155
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:37,820
We'll see if the guy you paid off the guy you paid off...

3156
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:39,820
He's gonna fucking destroy everyone.

3157
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:40,800
He's gonna destroy the competition.

3158
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:41,860
Oh my god.

3159
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:42,920
I believe in you.

3160
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:43,560
You got this.

3161
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:44,600
I believe.

3162
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:47,540
Alright, let's head off to the game.

3163
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:50,640
We're gonna head off to the casters broadcast.

3164
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:52,260
We'll see you guys in the ring.

3165
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:54,280
We'll see you and the homeless guy in the ring.

3166
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:56,120
Let's go, BD!

3167
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:57,680
I love BD!

3168
01:59:57,740 --> 01:59:58,360
No, I don't.

3169
01:59:58,660 --> 01:59:59,880
No, don't say that!

3170
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:02,740
Alright.

3171
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:06,160
So, Min, can you turn up yourself a little bit more?

3172
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:08,600
The sound guy's saying he wants to hear you more.

3173
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:09,620
Oh, okay.

3174
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:10,420
Hello.

3175
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:11,540
That was enough?

3176
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:12,400
I don't know.

3177
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,480
My ears don't work as good.

3178
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:16,840
Me neither.

3179
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:19,320
Alright.

3180
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:20,000
It seems...

3181
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:20,440
Oh my god.

3182
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,880
A lot of people think Haka's gonna win.

3183
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:22,900
It's cause it's not him.

3184
02:00:23,180 --> 02:00:25,240
I mean, like, he's pretty short, right?

3185
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:26,540
He has those heels on.

3186
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:27,780
Let me see.

3187
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:29,960
Yeah, I mean...

3188
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:30,700
We'll see.

3189
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,280
Again, it doesn't matter the size.

3190
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:34,360
It matters kinda the agility.

3191
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,380
I like how he's like 2D here.

3192
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,500
Wait, why is Haka just...

3193
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:41,920
What?

3194
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:42,920
What?

3195
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:45,040
Why is he just himself?

3196
02:00:46,100 --> 02:00:46,580
Okay.

3197
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:48,860
What the fuck?

3198
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:49,820
He's so short.

3199
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:50,520
Oh my god.

3200
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:54,260
Oh, but it doesn't matter.

3201
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:57,600
It doesn't fucking matter.

3202
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:58,820
He does not need height.

3203
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,260
No, exactly.

3204
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,380
The taller they are, the harder they fall.

3205
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:03,220
Exactly.

3206
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:05,780
I mean, I don't think these...

3207
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:07,680
I don't think any of these wrestlers are them.

3208
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,260
Like, I think they both hide in the back.

3209
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:11,220
I don't know.

3210
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:14,160
I can't see the resemblance with Juna.

3211
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:14,420
Who?

3212
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,620
Like, the furry tail?

3213
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:18,080
It feels like Juna just...

3214
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:20,580
The furry tail?

3215
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:25,500
Juna gave this random guy like $5 at Walmart to go crazy.

3216
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:28,720
I don't know.

3217
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,980
The budget cosplay.

3218
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:32,480
Oh, guys.

3219
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:35,500
I just realized we didn't do the intro, guys.

3220
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:37,600
We were so...

3221
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,780
Sorry, we got distracted by 2D Haka.

3222
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,140
Alright, should we...

3223
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:42,800
I mean, it's still early.

3224
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:43,580
We can restart it.

3225
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:44,920
We don't know who's gonna win.

3226
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:46,300
Yeah, true, true, true.

3227
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:47,420
Yeah, we don't know who's gonna win.

3228
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,560
So we can restart this.

3229
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:52,360
Guys, stop fighting, guys!

3230
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:55,780
Guys, stop fighting!

3231
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:56,440
This is not scripted.

3232
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:57,060
They were...

3233
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:57,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3234
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:59,200
We told them to stop.

3235
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:01,720
Why is he 2D?

3236
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:03,300
I don't know.

3237
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:05,680
Something made him 2D.

3238
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:07,420
I got distracted because he...

3239
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:09,620
You didn't even realize that he was 2D.

3240
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:10,480
I didn't either, yeah.

3241
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:11,920
Just looking at him.

3242
02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:14,540
Just a standing man emoji there.

3243
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,700
Haka, Haka, you were not winning.

3244
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,080
Yeah, it's true.

3245
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:22,860
You were absolutely not winning, Haka.

3246
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:26,920
The following contest is scheduled for one fall!

3247
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:29,880
Introducing first...

3248
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:33,560
I like how he's friendly.

3249
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,340
A bit dodgy!

3250
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:37,260
That juda-u!

3251
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:39,780
NAGI!

3252
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:42,000
Woo!

3253
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:42,640
Woo!

3254
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:44,160
The friendly ear lady!

3255
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,400
Oh my... what?

3256
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:48,660
I don't know, anything...

3257
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:50,200
long and slippery.

3258
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:51,280
I've seen those.

3259
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:52,320
They're not very friendly.

3260
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:53,580
What is this Riverdale shit?

3261
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:54,980
Like the cab thing?

3262
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:58,500
What do you mean Riverdale?

3263
02:02:58,780 --> 02:02:58,840
What do you mean Riverdale?

3264
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:01,120
Like, did you not see that fucking close up?

3265
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:01,700
And he's like...

3266
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:05,600
Yeah, it was like a little fan service, you know?

3267
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,580
Yeah, a little bit of fan... I mean...

3268
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:09,580
To be fair, she was giving the sotchi.

3269
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:11,720
This is the slowest walk, please can we pick it up?

3270
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:14,440
Please, we have a scheduler!

3271
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:17,380
Maybe we should have skipped the intros.

3272
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:19,280
Why are you looking at the camera again?

3273
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:20,400
Hahahaha!

3274
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:24,620
She was just like, my eyes are here, ladies.

3275
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:25,700
Yeah.

3276
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:29,600
Wait, did you hear that?

3277
02:03:29,620 --> 02:03:31,580
That lady in the audience was like...

3278
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:31,700
Yeah!

3279
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:33,580
Hahahaha!

3280
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:34,000
Hahahaha!

3281
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:38,800
Wow, Juno, you have such a biggest fan over there!

3282
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:39,740
Yeah!

3283
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:43,180
Yes, girl, give us nothing!

3284
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:44,280
Hahahaha!

3285
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:46,760
That's how we like it!

3286
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:48,600
Woo!

3287
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:51,540
We have no standards!

3288
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:52,760
Let's go!

3289
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:56,360
Yeah, finally, a little bit of pizazz.

3290
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:57,360
Whoa!

3291
02:03:58,840 --> 02:03:59,440
Finally!

3292
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:00,460
Oh, wow!

3293
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:03,200
I can like, imagine her to just be like...

3294
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:03,780
Yeah!

3295
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:07,600
And introducing their opponent!

3296
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:11,760
Hailing from the bathroom where they just suck an enormous shit!

3297
02:04:12,060 --> 02:04:12,720
Oh!

3298
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:16,900
Waka waka Benzo and Haka!

3299
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,520
Woo!

3300
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:20,160
Woo!

3301
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:23,660
At least Haka's giving us something.

3302
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:24,800
Something?

3303
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:26,920
Oh my god!

3304
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:29,160
He's wearing a mask too!

3305
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:30,380
Yeah.

3306
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:32,360
Keep it on.

3307
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:35,640
Hahahaha!

3308
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:39,640
Ladies, he leaves all of that on!

3309
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:40,600
Hahahaha!

3310
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:45,040
Hahahaha!

3311
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:47,540
Yeah.

3312
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:48,760
Alright.

3313
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:52,040
The crowd, I can't tell where the crowd is supporting right now, you know?

3314
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:57,380
I like how his intro was like, like, one third of Gina's intro.

3315
02:04:57,960 --> 02:04:59,080
That's so...

3316
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:00,140
Hahahaha!

3317
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:02,240
Oh my god!

3318
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:03,200
Alright.

3319
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:05,080
Finally, we're back in it!

3320
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:08,520
Oh!

3321
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:09,240
Oh!

3322
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:09,540
Oh!

3323
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:10,120
Another throw!

3324
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:11,100
From Haka!

3325
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:13,980
What does the back of Gina's shirt say?

3326
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:14,740
Family?

3327
02:05:15,820 --> 02:05:16,460
Family!

3328
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:27,500
Just so all you guys know, the ones that had like, fan-created wrestlers, um, the talents themselves chose the wrestler.

3329
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:31,860
So she specifically chose this guy that she paid off in the street.

3330
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:33,820
Okay, okay, okay.

3331
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:34,660
With family!

3332
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:36,400
With family!

3333
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:38,660
There's no family here.

3334
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,560
I mean, Haka's still... Haka's winning, still.

3335
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:43,920
I like how he's wrestling in flip-flops, though.

3336
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:45,300
Oh, damn!

3337
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:45,860
You're right!

3338
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:46,280
Yeah!

3339
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,340
This guy's ready to go to the beach!

3340
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:49,920
Woo!

3341
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:50,260
Oh!

3342
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:51,600
The kick to the head!

3343
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,040
What do you call that, Mint?

3344
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:54,620
What do you call this move?

3345
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:55,080
That was the...

3346
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:57,180
That was the screwy McDooey.

3347
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:58,840
The screwy McDooey?

3348
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:00,580
Live in WrestleTuber?

3349
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:01,120
Yeah!

3350
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:03,120
I thought that was a myth, Mint!

3351
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:03,720
Nope.

3352
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:04,800
It was real.

3353
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:07,080
And, you know, Haka is really proving himself.

3354
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:07,880
What is this?

3355
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:08,560
What the fuck?

3356
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,340
I call that the Humpty Dumpty.

3357
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:12,620
Oh no!

3358
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:17,660
Ian did have a great fall!

3359
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:22,060
He swinged out...

3360
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:30,300
She swinged that leg out, hoping that Humpty Dumpty would get me pieced back together again.

3361
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:31,700
How did you miss?

3362
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:33,260
That was huge!

3363
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:35,140
That's true.

3364
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:37,260
Haka, put on your glasses, Haka!

3365
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:39,420
Get back in the ring, guys!

3366
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:41,440
You don't want to get eliminated like Nia!

3367
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:42,760
Yeah!

3368
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:43,140
Oh!

3369
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:44,280
In the dick!

3370
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:45,900
If she had one...

3371
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:47,780
I think it was the stomach.

3372
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:50,860
You mean the dick is not there?

3373
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,180
It's all connected, I guess.

3374
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:00,080
Oh, nice.

3375
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:01,480
At least she put him back in the ring.

3376
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:03,100
She could've... She should've left him at home.

3377
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:03,980
She could've left him outside the ring, though.

3378
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:08,120
They could've easily, you know, won by the default.

3379
02:07:08,740 --> 02:07:09,180
Yeah.

3380
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:10,960
But no, this is a fair...

3381
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:13,360
Haka said he wanted a fair game, so...

3382
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:14,240
That's true.

3383
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:14,780
That's true.

3384
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:15,780
They're back outside the ring.

3385
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:17,820
Woah!

3386
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:18,880
Cutscene!

3387
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:23,280
Oh yeah, these people right here are getting a good show!

3388
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:24,980
Yeah, he's hyping the crowd up!

3389
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:27,020
He's like, do you like what you see?

3390
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:28,440
They're like, yeah!

3391
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:29,420
Haka's toes!

3392
02:07:29,420 --> 02:07:30,200
What?

3393
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:32,800
They're out!

3394
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:33,380
They're out!

3395
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:34,340
For free!

3396
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:35,420
They're not censored!

3397
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:36,600
Guys!

3398
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:39,400
Four...

3399
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:40,180
Alright, come on!

3400
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:40,580
Jump on!

3401
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:40,960
Yeah!

3402
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:42,260
Ah!

3403
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:45,860
Oh my god!

3404
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:48,840
She's definitely gonna need a doctor tomorrow.

3405
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:50,140
Yeah.

3406
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:52,540
And a medical fee.

3407
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:55,220
I wonder if Limeu's chiropractic service is open.

3408
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:58,560
I mean, she's eliminated, so it should be open by now.

3409
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:01,580
She needs one too.

3410
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:03,220
She needs the money, guys.

3411
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:06,160
Wait, what number are they at?

3412
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:06,580
Four.

3413
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:07,120
Four!

3414
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:09,720
Juna, get up, Juna!

3415
02:08:09,980 --> 02:08:10,920
Get up, Juna!

3416
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:13,180
Oh no!

3417
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:16,000
I like how Juna was like, indecisive there.

3418
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:17,160
She's like, do I pick him up?

3419
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:18,440
Or do I like, push him?

3420
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:22,320
Two!

3421
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:26,420
Two the audience?

3422
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:27,860
Woah!

3423
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:31,540
The audience is definitely getting their tickets worth.

3424
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:32,360
Yeah.

3425
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:36,260
This is, this was, but it's free for everybody watching at home!

3426
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:37,520
Yeah, it's free for you guys!

3427
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:38,580
No pay-per-view!

3428
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:39,580
Yeah!

3429
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:41,300
Right here!

3430
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:42,860
On Doki Bird Network.

3431
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:46,860
What the fuck was that?

3432
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:48,260
The B-D-N.

3433
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,040
I mean, D.

3434
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:59,080
I think you're missing an S there.

3435
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:07,320
I'm a little dyslexic.

3436
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,200
A little.

3437
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:10,040
Wait,

3438
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:13,830
one!

3439
02:09:14,150 --> 02:09:14,670
Two!

3440
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:15,270
Oh!

3441
02:09:15,510 --> 02:09:16,810
Haka got out!

3442
02:09:17,330 --> 02:09:18,630
Haka, you were winning!

3443
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:21,010
How did you fucking get pinned already?

3444
02:09:21,990 --> 02:09:24,270
Oh my god, she's measuring the cranium again?

3445
02:09:25,010 --> 02:09:25,650
Okay.

3446
02:09:25,730 --> 02:09:26,670
Oh, choking.

3447
02:09:26,690 --> 02:09:27,010
Oh!

3448
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:29,070
The elbow to the stomach!

3449
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:29,690
And the kick!

3450
02:09:29,910 --> 02:09:32,310
Oh my god.

3451
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:33,710
She's like, I'm a sucker.

3452
02:09:33,730 --> 02:09:34,150
I'm a sucker, baby.

3453
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:38,010
This is the, this is the pay me like you're French lady.

3454
02:09:40,590 --> 02:09:43,770
The infamous pay me like the French lady?

3455
02:09:44,010 --> 02:09:46,450
I thought that move was reserved for only Leo!

3456
02:09:46,970 --> 02:09:48,410
I thought it was banned!

3457
02:09:49,690 --> 02:09:51,830
Are all these moves apparently banned?

3458
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:57,490
Oh god, Haka's making a B right now!

3459
02:09:57,490 --> 02:09:59,030
He's using this B for his new song!

3460
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:00,970
Oh, another one!

3461
02:10:01,910 --> 02:10:02,470
One!

3462
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:04,210
Two!

3463
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:06,050
The winner

3464
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:11,700
is Haka!

3465
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:14,280
And here is your winner!

3466
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,840
Oh, waka waka!

3467
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:19,920
Benzo and HAKA!

3468
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:24,420
Oh, Juna better stick to interviewing.

3469
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:25,540
Yeah, Juna.

3470
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:27,980
I don't think wrestling was for you, man.

3471
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:28,900
Nah.

3472
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:35,400
Bro, he was like, he was like making a B and everything too.

3473
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:36,340
You saw that?

3474
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:37,860
Yeah!

3475
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:39,960
He was really revving up the crowd!

3476
02:10:41,220 --> 02:10:46,660
Alright, let's go to the interview to talk to to talk to the loser and the winner.

3477
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:47,980
Oh, she's already there.

3478
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,740
She has to be there.

3479
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,600
Alright, I'll see you there.

3480
02:10:55,980 --> 02:10:56,500
Alright.

3481
02:10:57,740 --> 02:10:59,040
I don't get paid enough.

3482
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:02,820
What can I say?

3483
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:04,000
I fucking warned you.

3484
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:05,160
I'm sorry.

3485
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:09,800
Juna, how could you lose?

3486
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:11,640
You literally watched so many games.

3487
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:12,940
Oh, sorry.

3488
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:17,900
The guy that I paid is useless and worthless and...

3489
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:18,900
Uh-huh.

3490
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:21,920
That sounds like a lot of excuses.

3491
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:23,380
Guys...

3492
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:27,600
Well, I'm gonna need some other criticism besides just from a lot of excuses.

3493
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:30,060
I need like actual criticism, Doki.

3494
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:33,620
You've been using that one a lot, Doki.

3495
02:11:33,860 --> 02:11:37,600
Haka, how do you feel winning against Juna there?

3496
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:39,680
It feels great, you know?

3497
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:42,460
The blood of my fucking enemies in my hand.

3498
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:43,560
It feels great.

3499
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:46,060
You're gonna have to watch him again.

3500
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:46,760
Again?

3501
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:49,680
I think he hasn't even...

3502
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:51,560
I'm a medium, you know?

3503
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:52,460
I possess him.

3504
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:53,740
I possess his fucking ass.

3505
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:56,480
I thought you meant medium-sized.

3506
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:57,760
I was so confused.

3507
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:58,260
No, that's good.

3508
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:00,180
After all, medium is premium.

3509
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:02,840
But yeah, I possess his fucking ass.

3510
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:04,300
I beat the shit out of you, bro.

3511
02:12:04,460 --> 02:12:05,260
How do you feel about that?

3512
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:09,080
I don't know if I should feel honored, but it was an experience.

3513
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:11,480
I can't believe I got beat by a twink.

3514
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:14,120
That only happens like once in your life.

3515
02:12:16,460 --> 02:12:22,640
Are you saying, Juna, that you threw so you had that honor to say that you were beat by a twink?

3516
02:12:22,660 --> 02:12:24,960
I like how Haka was just speechless.

3517
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:31,280
He didn't even know what to say to that.

3518
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:35,060
Haka, do you need like five minutes to think of a comeback?

3519
02:12:35,060 --> 02:12:36,960
Hold up, I'm like...

3520
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:39,880
I am sitting down here realizing what you just said.

3521
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:43,440
I'm just like trying to think of like wow, this is my life after all, you know?

3522
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:44,380
I could have been...

3523
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:46,380
I could have been more than this.

3524
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:48,340
I could give you swimming lessons too if you really need them.

3525
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:49,460
I remember that story.

3526
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:50,960
Your swimming story.

3527
02:12:51,540 --> 02:12:52,580
Hey bro, shut the fuck up.

3528
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:54,180
What is the story?

3529
02:12:54,600 --> 02:12:55,540
Share with the class.

3530
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:59,720
I got chased by a fucking crab and I almost drowned.

3531
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,720
What the... what?

3532
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:01,720
What?

3533
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:03,660
You got chased by a crab?

3534
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:05,400
A crab.

3535
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:07,640
A crab literally chased me and I almost drowned.

3536
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:08,760
Wow.

3537
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:11,420
Maybe you shouldn't have shared that story to the class.

3538
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:14,200
Maybe I shouldn't have shared that story, huh?

3539
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:20,200
Look how they're still trash talking even though Juno lost.

3540
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:21,940
I'm not trash talking.

3541
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:24,160
It's banter.

3542
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:28,340
You know at the end of the day, Juno might have lost the battle.

3543
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:30,100
But she won the war.

3544
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:31,040
Let me tell you that.

3545
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:32,320
The mental war.

3546
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:33,720
The mental warfare.

3547
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:40,180
Well, thank you again Haka and Juno for that exciting match.

3548
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:44,820
We are going to do a small intermission here.

3549
02:13:44,980 --> 02:13:48,540
It's time for Mint to be rotated.

3550
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:51,520
Well, me and Mint to be rotated out in the casting table.

3551
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:58,980
So we're gonna have a set of new casters joining in for half of bracket two and bracket three.

3552
02:13:59,020 --> 02:14:01,700
Thank you guys for joining in.

3553
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:03,720
For the first half.

3554
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:05,400
Thank you for having us.

3555
02:14:05,540 --> 02:14:06,460
Thank you guys.

3556
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:07,260
Thank you for joining.

3557
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:08,640
Thank you.

3558
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:12,340
Alright, we're gonna be going to intermission now.

3559
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:14,980
We'll see you guys in five to ten minutes.

3560
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:16,240
Bye bye guys.

3561
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:17,340
See you in five to ten minutes.

3562
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:18,100
Bye bye.

3563
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:21,700
Bye bye guys.

3564
02:22:12,750 --> 02:22:14,030
Hello everybody!

3565
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:19,310
And welcome back to WrestleTuber!

3566
02:22:19,990 --> 02:22:26,070
I will be stepping out from... I'll be rotated out as a caster and I'll be taking a little break now.

3567
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:30,650
But, as we know, we have several casters for WrestleTuber.

3568
02:22:30,970 --> 02:22:36,270
And they will be taking over the over for me and Mint.

3569
02:22:36,510 --> 02:22:41,590
So, why don't we welcome Gerard and Octavio!

3570
02:22:42,330 --> 02:22:42,930
Yeah!

3571
02:22:43,270 --> 02:22:43,850
Hello!

3572
02:22:44,970 --> 02:22:45,570
Hello!

3573
02:22:45,970 --> 02:22:47,810
Get rotated!

3574
02:22:49,050 --> 02:22:52,110
Why are you so mellow?

3575
02:22:52,810 --> 02:22:53,410
I...

3576
02:22:54,190 --> 02:22:57,170
I don't want to show my face on screen anymore for a bit.

3577
02:22:57,210 --> 02:22:58,010
I just fucking lost.

3578
02:22:58,550 --> 02:22:59,150
And...

3579
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:01,790
I don't want to be here anymore.

3580
02:23:01,790 --> 02:23:03,190
I thought I'd be winning.

3581
02:23:04,170 --> 02:23:05,270
I'm just gloating all over the place.

3582
02:23:05,310 --> 02:23:05,590
But no!

3583
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:07,830
I'm just... God damn it!

3584
02:23:08,110 --> 02:23:08,910
Hello guys!

3585
02:23:08,990 --> 02:23:09,830
Hello everybody!

3586
02:23:10,270 --> 02:23:11,530
My name is Gerard T.

3587
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:17,430
Rexford and I am Holostars English's devilishly handsome bounty hunter and the leader of the Armistice Unit.

3588
02:23:17,550 --> 02:23:20,590
And today I am joined by my co-host over here.

3589
02:23:20,750 --> 02:23:25,490
I am the opulent, optatonic, operatic puppeteer from Bounty Hunter Armistice of Holostars English.

3590
02:23:25,570 --> 02:23:26,390
My name is Octavio!

3591
02:23:27,150 --> 02:23:27,630
Hello!

3592
02:23:28,910 --> 02:23:29,710
Hello, hello.

3593
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:30,830
By the way, we practice an intro.

3594
02:23:30,990 --> 02:23:31,510
Let's do it.

3595
02:23:32,130 --> 02:23:32,390
Yeah.

3596
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:33,150
Yeah.

3597
02:23:34,170 --> 02:23:34,950
We totally did not.

3598
02:23:35,650 --> 02:23:36,130
Hello!

3599
02:23:37,310 --> 02:23:38,110
Mina-san.

3600
02:23:40,150 --> 02:23:40,630
Well...

3601
02:23:42,270 --> 02:23:43,470
We're already fumbling.

3602
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:45,670
Doki, this was not part of the plan!

3603
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:47,050
Why'd you throw us in here?

3604
02:23:47,170 --> 02:23:47,850
Now we know!

3605
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:51,090
Guys, here's the bracket.

3606
02:23:51,410 --> 02:24:00,450
This is like a very, very big dream come true to join WWE because this has been also a part of my childhood.

3607
02:24:00,750 --> 02:24:03,630
And yeah, thank you, thank you very much Doki.

3608
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:06,390
For letting us participate in this match.

3609
02:24:06,490 --> 02:24:07,590
Even though I fucking lost.

3610
02:24:07,790 --> 02:24:13,250
You know, it's still a great opportunity to like be able to participate in a massive event such as this.

3611
02:24:13,330 --> 02:24:14,250
So thank you, thank you.

3612
02:24:14,290 --> 02:24:15,530
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

3613
02:24:15,570 --> 02:24:18,090
This is better than the WWE because it's VTubers!

3614
02:24:18,990 --> 02:24:19,990
Yeah, VTubers edition!

3615
02:24:20,050 --> 02:24:20,490
It's a bunch of weirdos.

3616
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:23,570
And I never thought I'd be joining in an actual match!

3617
02:24:23,830 --> 02:24:25,070
You know, technically this counts.

3618
02:24:25,210 --> 02:24:25,690
You know?

3619
02:24:26,410 --> 02:24:28,290
Like, uh... And that was your last match too.

3620
02:24:28,570 --> 02:24:29,830
Yeah, it was my last.

3621
02:24:31,170 --> 02:24:34,390
It's not an actual television, but hey, it's YouTube everybody!

3622
02:24:34,650 --> 02:24:36,690
It's technically television at the same time.

3623
02:24:36,830 --> 02:24:39,550
I'd like to say hi to my mom and friends out there.

3624
02:24:39,870 --> 02:24:40,710
Oh my god.

3625
02:24:40,830 --> 02:24:41,670
They're all dead!

3626
02:24:41,690 --> 02:24:43,850
Yeah, oh yeah, they're dead!

3627
02:24:44,410 --> 02:24:45,950
65 million years ago!

3628
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:48,410
No, no, no, no, don't remind me!

3629
02:24:48,730 --> 02:24:51,270
But anyway, let's look at the bracket, shall we?

3630
02:24:51,290 --> 02:24:52,030
Let's look at the bracket.

3631
02:24:52,030 --> 02:24:52,250
Okay, okay.

3632
02:24:53,730 --> 02:24:57,630
So, we just finished with a matchup of, um...

3633
02:24:58,470 --> 02:24:58,910
uh...

3634
02:25:00,310 --> 02:25:00,750
uh...

3635
02:25:02,110 --> 02:25:03,770
Juno Unagi and Banzo Inhaka.

3636
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:05,270
Juno Unagi and Banzo Inhaka.

3637
02:25:05,290 --> 02:25:05,490
Our senpai!

3638
02:25:08,870 --> 02:25:12,610
Yeah, congratulations to Banzo Inhaka for actually winning that one.

3639
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:13,010
Yeah, congrats.

3640
02:25:13,290 --> 02:25:20,690
It was totally unexpected because according to Octavio, like right before we even went to here, he didn't even believe in his senpai.

3641
02:25:20,830 --> 02:25:25,270
He said, oh my god, I didn't even think Haka would pass because all the stars are fucking weak.

3642
02:25:25,390 --> 02:25:27,150
And you got that fucking ball.

3643
02:25:27,170 --> 02:25:27,310
Bro!

3644
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:29,610
You have to, like, root for us!

3645
02:25:29,690 --> 02:25:31,230
Honestly, the only one I believe in is myself!

3646
02:25:32,630 --> 02:25:33,630
And no one else.

3647
02:25:34,070 --> 02:25:34,610
Bro.

3648
02:25:35,990 --> 02:25:38,430
Everybody dunk on him if he fucking loses, alright?

3649
02:25:38,990 --> 02:25:40,730
Congratulations, Haka, you cheater.

3650
02:25:40,990 --> 02:25:42,310
You cheated in some way.

3651
02:25:42,650 --> 02:25:45,290
But hey, all the stars represent they won.

3652
02:25:45,590 --> 02:25:47,410
Congratulations though to the, uh...

3653
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:50,770
remaining participants who actually won.

3654
02:25:50,890 --> 02:25:51,750
So thank you.

3655
02:25:51,850 --> 02:25:55,210
And now up next is Fillion and Remilia.

3656
02:25:55,790 --> 02:25:59,110
They are gonna be scheduled for the next match.

3657
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:01,930
So, are you guys ready to rumble?

3658
02:26:05,190 --> 02:26:06,150
I think they are.

3659
02:26:06,350 --> 02:26:07,290
Let's wait, let's wait.

3660
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:08,370
They need to respond via chat.

3661
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:08,590
Say yes.

3662
02:26:08,730 --> 02:26:08,950
Say yes.

3663
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:10,470
They need to match my energy.

3664
02:26:10,570 --> 02:26:10,950
There we go.

3665
02:26:10,950 --> 02:26:11,590
Match my energy.

3666
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:13,630
Are you ready to rumble?

3667
02:26:15,390 --> 02:26:15,830
Yeah!

3668
02:26:15,830 --> 02:26:16,750
Octavio, come on!

3669
02:26:17,830 --> 02:26:18,970
What am I supposed to say?

3670
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:21,930
I am ready to rumble!

3671
02:26:23,090 --> 02:26:24,630
Yes, we are ready!

3672
02:26:24,870 --> 02:26:29,950
So let us now proceed to the 1v1 interview section.

3673
02:26:31,130 --> 02:26:31,690
Yoink!

3674
02:26:32,330 --> 02:26:35,010
Wait, um...

3675
02:26:35,010 --> 02:26:36,270
I think we need to move.

3676
02:26:36,410 --> 02:26:39,770
I was chilling in the interview while we...

3677
02:26:40,510 --> 02:26:45,150
Sorry, let me move out real quick, guys.

3678
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:45,810
Oh my god.

3679
02:26:46,750 --> 02:26:47,570
We're walking.

3680
02:26:48,210 --> 02:26:49,850
Currently walking towards the interview room.

3681
02:26:49,890 --> 02:26:50,270
There we go.

3682
02:26:51,110 --> 02:26:52,450
We finally made it.

3683
02:26:54,590 --> 02:26:57,070
I had to use my legs.

3684
02:26:57,690 --> 02:26:58,130
Alright.

3685
02:26:58,970 --> 02:26:59,410
Okay.

3686
02:27:00,310 --> 02:27:03,050
So, let us bring in the people!

3687
02:27:03,730 --> 02:27:04,990
Peeps, show yourselves!

3688
02:27:05,010 --> 02:27:05,610
The people!

3689
02:27:08,710 --> 02:27:10,530
Why am I just a PNG?

3690
02:27:11,810 --> 02:27:13,170
We're all PNGs.

3691
02:27:13,170 --> 02:27:14,310
Except the casters, please.

3692
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:16,410
What the fuck do you want?

3693
02:27:17,150 --> 02:27:18,170
We have two forums.

3694
02:27:18,570 --> 02:27:19,810
PNGs and live2dv.

3695
02:27:20,010 --> 02:27:21,110
Hey, this looks nice.

3696
02:27:21,170 --> 02:27:22,950
This WWE tournament is very nice.

3697
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:24,030
Don't you dare diss on it.

3698
02:27:24,130 --> 02:27:24,930
It's very nice.

3699
02:27:24,990 --> 02:27:25,690
It's very well produced.

3700
02:27:25,950 --> 02:27:26,590
Who do you think you are?

3701
02:27:26,590 --> 02:27:27,190
Who do you think you are?

3702
02:27:27,230 --> 02:27:28,110
You're fully animated.

3703
02:27:28,330 --> 02:27:29,750
You got the effing budget behind you.

3704
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:30,450
What is this, man?

3705
02:27:30,750 --> 02:27:32,430
I have casting perms, alright?

3706
02:27:32,630 --> 02:27:33,870
You are PNGs.

3707
02:27:33,870 --> 02:27:35,030
You're literally just about to fight.

3708
02:27:35,210 --> 02:27:35,290
I'm a caster too!

3709
02:27:35,530 --> 02:27:36,390
Unless Dogefire made me.

3710
02:27:36,390 --> 02:27:36,950
Oh wait, you are.

3711
02:27:37,450 --> 02:27:37,850
Yeah.

3712
02:27:38,270 --> 02:27:38,670
Yeah.

3713
02:27:39,030 --> 02:27:40,790
Well, it's not your turn, so shut up!

3714
02:27:41,030 --> 02:27:41,650
Oh no.

3715
02:27:41,850 --> 02:27:42,770
Okay, what are we doing?

3716
02:27:42,870 --> 02:27:43,270
What are we doing?

3717
02:27:43,310 --> 02:27:43,590
What are we doing?

3718
02:27:43,630 --> 02:27:43,890
What are we doing?

3719
02:27:43,910 --> 02:27:45,470
Oh, I'm so sorry to interrupt you and Remilia.

3720
02:27:45,650 --> 02:27:47,410
So, how are you guys feeling?

3721
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:53,570
I'm ready to smash her face into the floor and then deliver like Amazon Prime straight back to...

3722
02:27:53,570 --> 02:27:55,750
I don't know where she lives, but she's going there.

3723
02:27:57,150 --> 02:27:59,570
Oh my god!

3724
02:27:59,570 --> 02:28:00,510
You're just gonna accept that?

3725
02:28:01,370 --> 02:28:02,570
Remi, what's your response?

3726
02:28:03,690 --> 02:28:08,890
Hey, I know, I know I come in tiny size, but breaking your kneecaps is my forte.

3727
02:28:09,350 --> 02:28:10,630
Listen, listen.

3728
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:13,810
I've got power of darkness and light on my side.

3729
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:15,070
Lakes, fashion, and speed.

3730
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:19,910
I know I'm vertically challenged, but I'm standing taller than you right now in this room!

3731
02:28:20,110 --> 02:28:20,530
Oh, you think you're so tall?

3732
02:28:20,690 --> 02:28:21,270
How tall are you?

3733
02:28:21,390 --> 02:28:22,150
How tall are you?

3734
02:28:23,410 --> 02:28:24,450
I'm 139!

3735
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:25,350
I'm 139!

3736
02:28:25,850 --> 02:28:26,250
139!

3737
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:28,510
I'm tall!

3738
02:28:28,670 --> 02:28:31,610
Oh my god, they're clipping through the set!

3739
02:28:31,730 --> 02:28:32,130
Oh no!

3740
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:32,790
Are you okay?

3741
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:34,530
Wait, you look flat as frick!

3742
02:28:37,470 --> 02:28:38,390
Blow, blow!

3743
02:28:38,610 --> 02:28:39,150
Blow, blow!

3744
02:28:39,230 --> 02:28:40,390
The match hasn't even started yet!

3745
02:28:40,470 --> 02:28:40,630
It only hurts!

3746
02:28:40,630 --> 02:28:43,790
I may be flat, okay, but my butt is packing.

3747
02:28:44,010 --> 02:28:44,550
What about you?

3748
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:45,870
What do you bring in the picture?

3749
02:28:46,110 --> 02:28:47,750
I bring in a Mastermind IQ.

3750
02:28:48,250 --> 02:28:48,650
Frank!

3751
02:28:48,650 --> 02:28:49,030
Frank, stupid!

3752
02:28:49,590 --> 02:28:49,990
Stupid!

3753
02:28:49,990 --> 02:28:51,190
Flat, flat, stupid!

3754
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:54,930
It's like an elementary school fight right here.

3755
02:28:55,830 --> 02:28:57,750
I am a CEO of a business!

3756
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:00,410
Oh, you got a boob on your nose!

3757
02:29:00,610 --> 02:29:02,110
Oh, you got a poopy on your butt!

3758
02:29:02,910 --> 02:29:03,350
Okay.

3759
02:29:03,690 --> 02:29:03,910
Yeah!

3760
02:29:05,870 --> 02:29:08,050
Elementary-style fighting, Jesus Christ.

3761
02:29:08,150 --> 02:29:08,330
Yeah.

3762
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:12,070
So who do you guys think is gonna win today's match?

3763
02:29:12,430 --> 02:29:13,210
Well, I...

3764
02:29:13,910 --> 02:29:15,230
Can I hear their war cries?

3765
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:17,450
I'll do it.

3766
02:29:17,530 --> 02:29:17,970
Give me a roar.

3767
02:29:18,030 --> 02:29:19,930
Can I please hear a war cry from both of you guys?

3768
02:29:20,250 --> 02:29:21,130
Let me go first.

3769
02:29:22,890 --> 02:29:23,330
Whoa!

3770
02:29:23,830 --> 02:29:24,310
Whoa!

3771
02:29:24,610 --> 02:29:25,090
Roar!

3772
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:27,170
Okay.

3773
02:29:29,010 --> 02:29:30,670
Okay, that was strangely adorable.

3774
02:29:30,850 --> 02:29:32,550
That's like a solid 8 out of 10.

3775
02:29:33,190 --> 02:29:34,210
I'm so scared.

3776
02:29:34,370 --> 02:29:35,470
10 out of 10 intimidating.

3777
02:29:35,770 --> 02:29:36,330
Holy shit.

3778
02:29:36,530 --> 02:29:37,710
I was channeling your inner Senzala.

3779
02:29:38,010 --> 02:29:38,470
Rar!

3780
02:29:38,530 --> 02:29:40,050
XT nuzzled, pounces on you.

3781
02:29:40,090 --> 02:29:41,050
Ooh, you so warm.

3782
02:29:41,050 --> 02:29:42,430
I'll show you real warm.

3783
02:29:42,510 --> 02:29:43,350
You ready?

3784
02:29:43,990 --> 02:29:44,410
You ready?

3785
02:29:44,770 --> 02:29:45,690
I'm getting attacked!

3786
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:46,470
Ah, brain damage!

3787
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:48,050
Oh!

3788
02:29:49,630 --> 02:29:50,110
Oh!

3789
02:29:50,110 --> 02:29:51,570
Oh, damn.

3790
02:29:51,570 --> 02:29:52,850
Now the psychic damage.

3791
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:57,910
God, I, uh, I thought I'm stupid, but I guess God made you an exception.

3792
02:29:58,350 --> 02:29:58,590
Oh!

3793
02:29:58,610 --> 02:29:59,050
Okay.

3794
02:29:59,330 --> 02:29:59,770
Oh!

3795
02:30:01,870 --> 02:30:03,230
She called you stupid!

3796
02:30:03,830 --> 02:30:04,270
Oh!

3797
02:30:05,210 --> 02:30:07,650
Yeah, yeah, with a pot calling the kettle black, dog.

3798
02:30:07,810 --> 02:30:08,470
I mean, look at you.

3799
02:30:08,550 --> 02:30:11,570
You're effing stupid, you're short, you're flat, we're the same person.

3800
02:30:12,530 --> 02:30:13,410
Guys, guys!

3801
02:30:13,630 --> 02:30:14,150
The twins!

3802

Yo!

3804
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:18,850
It's like a dip is fighting itself.

3805
02:30:18,930 --> 02:30:19,170
I think this is...

3806
02:30:19,170 --> 02:30:20,130
I think this is personal now.

3807
02:30:20,290 --> 02:30:22,430
Are we doing it You are more than your flatness.

3808
02:30:22,490 --> 02:30:24,510
Bro, stop projecting, bro!

3809
02:30:25,310 --> 02:30:26,010
Stop it, man.

3810
02:30:26,010 --> 02:30:26,950
What are you, a Twitter user?

3811
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,870
What the frick?

3812
02:30:28,810 --> 02:30:30,090
Are you fighting for real?

3813
02:30:31,490 --> 02:30:32,670

3814
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:32,810

3819
02:30:37,310 --> 02:30:37,670
Nerd.

3823
02:30:45,550 --> 02:30:48,710
Because we are gonna transition to the actual match now.

3824
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:50,590
Do I get to go or do I beat her up?

3825
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,370
Up.

3826
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:55,010
Okay, nevermind, sorry.

3827
02:30:56,630 --> 02:30:57,910
There you go, there we go.

3828
02:30:58,610 --> 02:30:58,970
Whoa!

3829
02:30:59,730 --> 02:31:00,710
Sorry, sorry, that was my lunch break.

3830
02:31:00,930 --> 02:31:02,650
Sorry, I didn't realize you guys were gonna be here too.

3831
02:31:03,310 --> 02:31:04,030
The melee...

3832
02:31:05,510 --> 02:31:06,990
You just keep bothering her.

3833
02:31:07,130 --> 02:31:07,790
Sorry, guys.

3834
02:31:08,090 --> 02:31:09,310
I was just chilling here.

3835
02:31:09,310 --> 02:31:09,990
You need to go backstage.

3836
02:31:10,550 --> 02:31:12,310
I didn't realize you guys were gonna be here too.

3837
02:31:12,650 --> 02:31:13,010
Like...

3838
02:31:14,250 --> 02:31:15,530
What was I supposed to do?

3839
02:31:15,550 --> 02:31:16,210
I was supposed to know that.

3840
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:18,590
Guys, okay, give me a sec.

3841
02:31:18,610 --> 02:31:19,170
Go to the break room.

3842
02:31:20,230 --> 02:31:20,890
Hey, what?

3843
02:31:22,290 --> 02:31:22,690
This...

3844
02:31:22,690 --> 02:31:24,090
There is no break room.

3845
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:27,810
Did you not see what Nero and Zendaya did to that break room?

3846
02:31:27,910 --> 02:31:27,930
Let us in!

3847
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:28,470
Let me in!

3848
02:31:28,870 --> 02:31:29,710
Let me inside!

3849
02:31:30,730 --> 02:31:32,130
We're knocking on this door!

3850
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:32,810
Let us in!

3851
02:31:33,130 --> 02:31:34,510
Give me a sec, guys, I just need a...

3852
02:31:34,510 --> 02:31:35,090
Let me in!

3853
02:31:37,870 --> 02:31:40,070
Guys, be fucking patient, guys!

3854
02:31:41,570 --> 02:31:42,530
Oh my god!

3855
02:31:42,530 --> 02:31:44,090
You told us to cast!

3856
02:31:44,330 --> 02:31:45,250
Be patient!

3857
02:31:45,970 --> 02:31:48,850
I didn't find the key to the...

3858
02:31:48,850 --> 02:31:50,450
I need to find the key, guys!

3859
02:31:50,830 --> 02:31:52,330
It's so bad, get out!

3860
02:31:53,810 --> 02:31:56,030
Give me a sec, I'm trying to find the key!

3861
02:31:56,870 --> 02:31:58,130
Give me a sec!

3862
02:31:58,370 --> 02:32:00,070
What is taking so long?

3863
02:32:00,330 --> 02:32:00,690
Guys!

3864
02:32:01,010 --> 02:32:02,150
I forgot!

3865
02:32:02,290 --> 02:32:03,910
I forgot where the key is!

3866
02:32:04,210 --> 02:32:04,690
Security!

3867
02:32:06,300 --> 02:32:06,590
Security!

3868
02:32:07,270 --> 02:32:08,130
Oh, you're...

3869
02:32:08,130 --> 02:32:08,910
You're not...

3870
02:32:10,190 --> 02:32:12,670
This is why we have day two, guys.

3871
02:32:12,950 --> 02:32:15,370
I thought you actually prepared it, you're still...

3872
02:32:16,010 --> 02:32:17,150
You're still setting it up.

3873
02:32:18,710 --> 02:32:21,430
So that's what's taking so long, Jesus Christ.

3874
02:32:21,530 --> 02:32:22,850
Guys, this is why we have day two.

3875
02:32:23,170 --> 02:32:25,190
This is why we have day two.

3876
02:32:25,370 --> 02:32:27,930
Don't worry, guys, day two will be even better.

3877
02:32:28,090 --> 02:32:30,110
Day two, everything will be... Wait, I'm still bouncing around.

3878
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:32,970
You can tell I'm doing this all by myself.

3879
02:32:34,110 --> 02:32:35,150
No promises.

3880
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:37,150
Doing great so far.

3881
02:32:37,430 --> 02:32:39,390
Guys, I'm just trying to find Gerard right now.

3882
02:32:39,450 --> 02:32:40,010
There he is.

3883
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:41,110
There you go.

3884
02:32:41,110 --> 02:32:42,610
I like it.

3885
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:43,750
There you go.

3886
02:32:44,070 --> 02:32:45,330
Here you are.

3887
02:32:45,810 --> 02:32:47,310
Alright, we're in, baby!

3888
02:32:47,570 --> 02:32:48,230
We got in!

3889
02:32:48,330 --> 02:32:49,530
Back to the break room I go.

3890
02:32:50,250 --> 02:32:50,730
Finally.

3891
02:32:52,190 --> 02:32:56,870
Finally, we can see the matchup between Fillion and Remilia!

3892
02:33:00,950 --> 02:33:02,030
Bro, look at their...

3893
02:33:02,030 --> 02:33:03,470
Look at their models here.

3894
02:33:03,730 --> 02:33:04,690
The wrestlers.

3895
02:33:05,170 --> 02:33:05,930
What is that?

3896
02:33:06,250 --> 02:33:06,730
Oh my god.

3897
02:33:08,750 --> 02:33:11,390
Fillion reminds me of a feral ghoul in Fallout.

3898
02:33:14,370 --> 02:33:15,210
What is that?

3899
02:33:16,410 --> 02:33:17,390
Remilia's hair.

3900
02:33:18,470 --> 02:33:19,530
What's that supposed to be?

3901
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:20,550
White meat.

3902
02:33:20,570 --> 02:33:21,090
Looks like an elephant.

3903
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:24,430
The following contest...

3904
02:33:24,430 --> 02:33:27,430
One in a billion...

3905
02:33:28,130 --> 02:33:28,450
Fillion!

3906
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:33,410
We got kicked out.

3907
02:33:33,470 --> 02:33:33,730
Uh oh.

3908
02:33:33,850 --> 02:33:34,950
We got kicked out.

3909
02:33:34,950 --> 02:33:35,810
We disappeared from existence.

3910
02:33:35,810 --> 02:33:36,250
Help!

3911
02:33:37,010 --> 02:33:37,450
Help!

3912
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:37,930
Let us in!

3913
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:39,330
Let us in!

3914
02:33:39,610 --> 02:33:40,850
We can't commentate!

3915
02:33:41,150 --> 02:33:41,810
Oh no!

3916
02:33:42,130 --> 02:33:42,830
Let us in!

3917
02:33:42,870 --> 02:33:43,530
Okay, okay.

3918
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:45,190
Let's go!

3919
02:33:48,850 --> 02:33:50,090
Oh, that's cute though.

3920
02:33:50,130 --> 02:33:50,590
That's cute.

3921
02:33:50,690 --> 02:33:51,070
That's cute.

3922
02:33:51,710 --> 02:33:53,750
Let's go, Fillion, Filipino boy!

3923
02:33:54,250 --> 02:33:56,610
I don't know why they call Fillion that way.

3924
02:33:59,050 --> 02:33:59,490
Let's fucking go!

3925
02:33:59,490 --> 02:33:59,930
Damn, she's dancing.

3926
02:34:00,370 --> 02:34:02,250
That is some heavy moves right there.

3927
02:34:02,310 --> 02:34:04,790
Do you think that will pack a punch when it comes to the ring though?

3928
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:05,710
I don't know.

3929
02:34:05,890 --> 02:34:09,050
If you ask me, they will better need the moves.

3930
02:34:10,450 --> 02:34:11,430
The moves?

3931
02:34:11,830 --> 02:34:12,970
Yeah, the moves.

3932
02:34:13,990 --> 02:34:15,070
Fillion here...

3933
02:34:15,950 --> 02:34:17,070
A true Terpsichorean.

3934
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:19,030
Just showing it off!

3935
02:34:19,470 --> 02:34:20,010
BAM!

3936
02:34:20,190 --> 02:34:20,730
Wow!

3937
02:34:21,150 --> 02:34:22,370
Total confidence!

3938
02:34:22,670 --> 02:34:23,390
What the hell?

3939
02:34:23,450 --> 02:34:24,310
He's hitting that Gritty!

3940
02:34:24,350 --> 02:34:25,070
What the hell?

3941
02:34:25,270 --> 02:34:26,230
What is that move?

3942
02:34:26,270 --> 02:34:28,370
That Ney-Ney!

3943
02:34:28,830 --> 02:34:29,370
Woo!

3944
02:34:30,390 --> 02:34:31,490
Oh my god!

3945
02:34:31,630 --> 02:34:33,370
We have a performer here, everybody.

3946
02:34:33,730 --> 02:34:34,750
Is this a dance battle?

3947
02:34:34,950 --> 02:34:35,550
What's going on here?

3948
02:34:35,770 --> 02:34:36,930
Introducing their opponent!

3949
02:34:37,970 --> 02:34:39,810
Oh shit, someone's in Canada.

3950
02:34:40,770 --> 02:34:42,430
Hailing from Canada!

3951
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:47,390
The smallest, yet greatest idea!

3952
02:34:48,410 --> 02:34:49,090
The smallest, yet greatest idea!

3953
02:34:49,810 --> 02:34:50,490
Romelia!

3954
02:34:52,670 --> 02:34:54,890
Super Transite Babu Babu!

3955
02:34:54,890 --> 02:34:55,530
What is that name?

3956
02:34:56,150 --> 02:34:58,210
Oh, the flag of Canada behind!

3957
02:34:59,070 --> 02:34:59,750
Oh!

3958
02:35:00,450 --> 02:35:00,530
Oh!

3959
02:35:02,570 --> 02:35:03,490
What the...

3960
02:35:03,730 --> 02:35:03,770
Oh, the outfit!

3961
02:35:04,350 --> 02:35:05,570
It's like a maid outfit!

3962
02:35:08,030 --> 02:35:09,450
Well, she's made for this.

3963
02:35:09,630 --> 02:35:10,810
Look at that swagger!

3964
02:35:12,490 --> 02:35:14,230
Do we have a poll in the chat?

3965
02:35:14,330 --> 02:35:15,210
Who do you think will win?

3966
02:35:16,110 --> 02:35:18,430
She's the most swaggy angel I've ever seen.

3967
02:35:18,670 --> 02:35:19,990
Fillion or Romelia?

3968
02:35:21,770 --> 02:35:22,170
You're wrestling.

3969
02:35:23,150 --> 02:35:23,550
Bruh.

3970
02:35:25,110 --> 02:35:26,390
I'm looking at two screens right now.

3971
02:35:26,430 --> 02:35:26,710
Here we go.

3972
02:35:27,810 --> 02:35:30,010
I like the color scheme here.

3973
02:35:30,010 --> 02:35:30,690
Yeah, very elegant moves though.

3974
02:35:30,690 --> 02:35:32,090
Reminds me of the good old...

3975
02:35:32,090 --> 02:35:33,290
the good old...

3976
02:35:33,290 --> 02:35:34,050
Canada.

3977
02:35:34,770 --> 02:35:35,590
Oh Canada.

3978
02:35:35,770 --> 02:35:36,170
Oh Canada.

3979
02:35:36,410 --> 02:35:38,090
Why are they all doing dance moves?

3980
02:35:38,250 --> 02:35:39,230
Did they plan this out?

3981
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:41,610
They're doing dance moves!

3982
02:35:41,750 --> 02:35:42,890
Why are they doing this?

3983
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:44,790
This is gonna be a dance battle.

3984
02:35:45,590 --> 02:35:47,070
Battle of the dancing with the stars.

3985
02:35:47,070 --> 02:35:50,750
I will be super disappointed if it isn't like dance moves.

3986
02:35:50,930 --> 02:35:52,290
That they're like swinging at each other.

3987
02:35:53,870 --> 02:35:54,310
Ooh!

3988
02:35:54,830 --> 02:35:55,550
Hey yo!

3989
02:35:55,590 --> 02:35:56,010
Hey yo!

3990
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,430
Hey yo!

3991
02:35:56,450 --> 02:35:56,890
Whoa!

3992
02:35:57,310 --> 02:35:57,750
Whoa!

3993
02:35:57,750 --> 02:35:58,370
Whoa!

3994
02:35:59,090 --> 02:36:00,370
Look at that flexibility!

3995
02:36:01,690 --> 02:36:03,090
Damn, damn, damn.

3996
02:36:03,570 --> 02:36:06,410
She's got rubber bands for arms and legs.

3997
02:36:08,750 --> 02:36:09,310
She's got rubber bands for arms and legs.

3998
02:36:09,310 --> 02:36:10,990
Just showing off that flexibility to the crowd.

3999
02:36:11,010 --> 02:36:11,090
Stretching those hamstrings.

4000
02:36:11,690 --> 02:36:14,330
Showing that they are not meant to be...

4001
02:36:14,330 --> 02:36:15,230
Grinding as well?

4002
02:36:15,290 --> 02:36:16,010
What the heck?

4003
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:17,230
Wow.

4004
02:36:17,510 --> 02:36:18,490
Wow, given that...

4005
02:36:18,490 --> 02:36:20,410
And it doesn't end there.

4006
02:36:20,770 --> 02:36:22,010
It just keeps going.

4007
02:36:22,190 --> 02:36:23,270
It just keeps going.

4008
02:36:24,310 --> 02:36:26,470
Oh finally, the match is starting.

4009
02:36:27,970 --> 02:36:28,450
They perform.

4010
02:36:29,330 --> 02:36:32,050
They're on stage performers in a sense.

4011
02:36:32,150 --> 02:36:33,790
They're technically on stage performers.

4012
02:36:33,890 --> 02:36:34,490
No, this is real.

4013
02:36:34,530 --> 02:36:35,210
This is a real fight.

4014
02:36:35,310 --> 02:36:36,210
They're not fake!

4015
02:36:36,550 --> 02:36:37,670
And the match begins!

4016
02:36:37,850 --> 02:36:38,410
Oh my god!

4017
02:36:39,170 --> 02:36:39,650
Immediately!

4018
02:36:40,470 --> 02:36:41,590
With a running attack!

4019
02:36:42,410 --> 02:36:43,890
And with a counter right there.

4020
02:36:43,930 --> 02:36:44,570
Bouncing off!

4021
02:36:44,750 --> 02:36:45,610
And got caught!

4022
02:36:46,510 --> 02:36:47,430
And an attack!

4023
02:36:47,710 --> 02:36:48,050
Oh!

4024
02:36:48,050 --> 02:36:49,570
I thought that was gonna be a combo!

4025
02:36:49,570 --> 02:36:50,070
That must have hurt.

4026
02:36:51,330 --> 02:36:52,710
And they're doing a six twister.

4027
02:36:52,710 --> 02:36:54,650
She's so aggressive already at the start!

4028
02:36:55,130 --> 02:36:55,610
What?

4029
02:36:55,670 --> 02:36:56,510
An arm bar everybody!

4030
02:36:56,550 --> 02:36:57,110
And a submission!

4031
02:36:57,750 --> 02:36:58,190
And a round away!

4032
02:37:00,830 --> 02:37:01,830
Oh, kick to the leg!

4033
02:37:01,930 --> 02:37:02,070
Oh!

4034
02:37:02,230 --> 02:37:02,510
Oh!

4035
02:37:02,750 --> 02:37:03,630
Ah, that hurts!

4036
02:37:03,970 --> 02:37:05,470
Look at those combos, man!

4037
02:37:06,030 --> 02:37:07,830
A sound blow blows from...

4038
02:37:10,170 --> 02:37:11,350
Oh, close line!

4039
02:37:11,450 --> 02:37:11,850
A close line!

4040
02:37:12,090 --> 02:37:12,450
Yes!

4041
02:37:12,650 --> 02:37:13,890
It's the only move I know!

4042
02:37:14,030 --> 02:37:14,350
One!

4043
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:15,350
Two!

4044
02:37:15,630 --> 02:37:17,490
Ah, no, no, no.

4045
02:37:17,650 --> 02:37:18,190
Still too early.

4046
02:37:18,210 --> 02:37:18,690
Still too early.

4047
02:37:18,770 --> 02:37:19,690
Too early, too early.

4048
02:37:19,810 --> 02:37:21,830
But you know, that would be funny though if they actually got a pin!

4049
02:37:22,170 --> 02:37:22,530
Whoa!

4050
02:37:24,690 --> 02:37:25,050
Reversal!

4051
02:37:26,850 --> 02:37:27,290
Whoa!

4052
02:37:27,290 --> 02:37:28,270
They're taking turns here!

4053
02:37:28,870 --> 02:37:29,930
Focusing on the hands!

4054
02:37:30,350 --> 02:37:31,350
Gonna injure that hand!

4055
02:37:31,770 --> 02:37:33,450
And knee to the face!

4056
02:37:33,490 --> 02:37:34,090
That's gotta hurt!

4057
02:37:34,090 --> 02:37:35,950
I gotta say, that's a pretty smart move actually.

4058
02:37:36,110 --> 02:37:41,490
Like aiming for the arms because they can't actually grapple nor punch anyone else if they actually damage the arms.

4059
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:41,690
True, true.

4060
02:37:42,290 --> 02:37:44,970
They can grab the rope when you pin them too.

4061
02:37:45,390 --> 02:37:45,830
Oh!

4062
02:37:46,010 --> 02:37:46,850
A flying attack!

4063
02:37:47,210 --> 02:37:48,190
And a DDT!

4064
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:48,650
Damn!

4065
02:37:49,410 --> 02:37:50,690
It was an elbow!

4066
02:37:51,270 --> 02:37:52,230
It was an elbow.

4067
02:37:52,230 --> 02:37:53,130
The subverting expectations.

4068
02:37:55,770 --> 02:37:56,670
Oh, a kick!

4069
02:37:56,770 --> 02:37:57,710
Oh, is that allowed?

4070
02:37:58,110 --> 02:37:59,290
What's going on?

4071
02:37:59,770 --> 02:38:00,290
Oh!

4072
02:38:01,710 --> 02:38:03,330
Everyone's doing some flashy moves!

4073
02:38:03,610 --> 02:38:06,450
Yeah, everybody's like somersaulting.

4074
02:38:06,630 --> 02:38:07,150
One!

4075
02:38:07,590 --> 02:38:08,110
Two!

4076
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:10,410
Oh, I thought that was already it.

4077
02:38:10,430 --> 02:38:12,750
That was so anti-climactic if that ever happened.

4078
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:12,830
Damn.

4079
02:38:13,650 --> 02:38:14,750
And he escaped!

4080
02:38:15,070 --> 02:38:15,910
Oh, shit!

4081
02:38:16,310 --> 02:38:18,650
Trying to run away from the responsibilities, huh?

4082
02:38:18,870 --> 02:38:19,770
Pretty familiar.

4083
02:38:19,770 --> 02:38:20,170
Reversal.

4084
02:38:22,150 --> 02:38:25,050
Let's see if you can fly away with this one, with those wings of yours.

4085
02:38:25,290 --> 02:38:26,270
And carrying!

4086
02:38:27,970 --> 02:38:29,270
Oh, someone's bleeding!

4087
02:38:29,490 --> 02:38:30,810
That drew some blood!

4088
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:31,550
First blood!

4089
02:38:33,610 --> 02:38:36,270
Fillion is bleeding from the nose.

4090
02:38:36,470 --> 02:38:36,790
Oh!

4091
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:38,230
One of those things again.

4092
02:38:38,330 --> 02:38:43,290
The complicated Remilia and Fillion fight is already intense.

4093
02:38:43,470 --> 02:38:45,510
There's already blood gushing out through the ring.

4094
02:38:45,630 --> 02:38:47,250
And are they gonna get counted out?

4095
02:38:47,390 --> 02:38:48,250
Five seconds!

4096
02:38:49,970 --> 02:38:51,230
Five seconds until...

4097
02:38:51,750 --> 02:38:53,930
One gets decided to be the victor.

4098
02:38:54,450 --> 02:38:55,770
Throw inside the ring.

4099
02:38:58,170 --> 02:38:58,690
Oh.

4100
02:38:59,290 --> 02:39:00,090
What's gonna happen?

4101
02:39:00,870 --> 02:39:01,590
Reversal, please?

4102
02:39:01,610 --> 02:39:02,230
Is that a finisher?

4103
02:39:02,370 --> 02:39:03,450
Oh, it wasn't a finisher.

4104
02:39:03,670 --> 02:39:04,410
It's a pin!

4105
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:06,750
What a flashy pin!

4106
02:39:07,130 --> 02:39:08,150
That was quick!

4107
02:39:08,550 --> 02:39:09,470
Too quick!

4108
02:39:11,630 --> 02:39:12,210
Throwing it.

4109
02:39:12,590 --> 02:39:13,810
And another one!

4110
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:17,430
Could you please stop hitting me on the neck?

4111
02:39:17,650 --> 02:39:18,570
Oh, another pin!

4112
02:39:20,390 --> 02:39:21,350
Oh, another pin!

4113
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:21,750
It's a submission!

4114
02:39:24,370 --> 02:39:26,530
Damn, but it was able to grapple free.

4115
02:39:26,630 --> 02:39:27,570
I mean, get free.

4116
02:39:27,970 --> 02:39:31,530
I've only been seeing big bodied men fighting.

4117
02:39:31,850 --> 02:39:36,230
But I've never seen these builds before fight.

4118
02:39:36,590 --> 02:39:41,150
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is the first very fast paced kind of movement fight.

4119
02:39:42,550 --> 02:39:43,070
Yeah, yeah.

4120
02:39:43,150 --> 02:39:46,070
We got thin representation from Fillion right now.

4121
02:39:46,730 --> 02:39:48,610
Everybody's big, bulky, and muscly.

4122
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:50,890
Oh shit, that's gotta hurt.

4123
02:39:51,090 --> 02:39:51,590
It...

4124
02:39:52,310 --> 02:39:53,270
Oh, reversal!

4125
02:39:55,010 --> 02:39:56,470
Dropkick, what is gonna happen?

4126
02:39:57,070 --> 02:39:57,950
Come on, come on!

4127
02:39:57,950 --> 02:39:58,590
Oh, dropkick!

4128
02:39:59,870 --> 02:40:01,710
Oh my god, that hurts!

4129
02:40:02,250 --> 02:40:03,450
That might be it!

4130
02:40:04,730 --> 02:40:06,050
She's waiting for the finisher!

4131
02:40:06,150 --> 02:40:06,990
The default finisher!

4132
02:40:07,470 --> 02:40:07,990
Yeah!

4133
02:40:09,870 --> 02:40:10,750
And here it is!

4134
02:40:11,910 --> 02:40:13,410
Kick to the face!

4135
02:40:13,430 --> 02:40:14,850
That might be it!

4136
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:16,010
Is this it for Fillion?

4137
02:40:16,230 --> 02:40:17,730
Are they gonna win?

4138
02:40:17,870 --> 02:40:20,250
One, two, What?

4139
02:40:23,690 --> 02:40:25,050
Ayo, fucking double!

4140
02:40:25,170 --> 02:40:26,350
Let's go!

4141
02:40:26,550 --> 02:40:27,450
Another pin!

4142
02:40:28,430 --> 02:40:29,530
Is this it?

4143
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:30,410
Two!

4144
02:40:32,470 --> 02:40:33,730
She's so strong!

4145
02:40:33,810 --> 02:40:35,430
Escape the wall!

4146
02:40:35,790 --> 02:40:38,010
Missed that dive!

4147
02:40:38,530 --> 02:40:39,270
Unfortunately.

4148
02:40:41,310 --> 02:40:42,970
Sponsored by Gamersups, everybody.

4149
02:40:43,350 --> 02:40:43,850
Ah!

4150
02:40:44,850 --> 02:40:45,130
Oh!

4151
02:40:45,970 --> 02:40:46,530
Pin!

4152
02:40:46,890 --> 02:40:47,390
Reversal!

4153
02:40:47,410 --> 02:40:48,130
Is this it?

4154
02:40:48,150 --> 02:40:48,670
One!

4155
02:40:49,110 --> 02:40:49,670
Two!

4156
02:40:50,250 --> 02:40:50,750
Oh!

4157
02:40:53,650 --> 02:40:56,090
Fillion is actually stronger than she looks!

4158
02:40:57,250 --> 02:40:59,650
As a dancer, her limbs are very limber.

4159
02:41:01,310 --> 02:41:03,930
Two finishers isn't enough to bring one down.

4160
02:41:04,150 --> 02:41:05,650
This is a very fast-paced battle.

4161
02:41:05,890 --> 02:41:08,250
It is, it's like watching an anime fight.

4162
02:41:09,550 --> 02:41:10,110
Oh!

4163
02:41:10,450 --> 02:41:11,010
Oh!

4164
02:41:11,550 --> 02:41:12,530
Here we go again!

4165
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:15,150
Whoa!

4166
02:41:15,810 --> 02:41:17,670
What is that athleticism?

4167
02:41:18,290 --> 02:41:19,530
Flexibility on this play.

4168
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:20,330
That was something.

4169
02:41:20,530 --> 02:41:21,230
It was nice.

4170
02:41:21,370 --> 02:41:21,970
Very nice.

4171
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:23,490
Emilia escaping through the turnbuckles.

4172
02:41:24,670 --> 02:41:25,470
Throwing him again.

4173
02:41:25,590 --> 02:41:26,150
What is this technique?

4174
02:41:26,490 --> 02:41:26,870
Oh!

4175
02:41:26,990 --> 02:41:29,870
This is crazy!

4176
02:41:30,730 --> 02:41:33,270
How can one person have such athleticism?

4177
02:41:33,410 --> 02:41:34,150
And agility.

4178
02:41:34,810 --> 02:41:36,650
Everyone here is a high-flyer!

4179
02:41:36,650 --> 02:41:37,050
And a pin!

4180
02:41:37,310 --> 02:41:37,850
A pin!

4181
02:41:38,110 --> 02:41:39,590
Is this a finisher?

4182
02:41:39,690 --> 02:41:40,210
Is this it?

4183
02:41:40,370 --> 02:41:40,830
One!

4184
02:41:41,150 --> 02:41:41,670
Two!

4185
02:41:41,670 --> 02:41:42,090
Three!

4186
02:41:42,350 --> 02:41:43,770
There's nothing!

4187
02:41:43,970 --> 02:41:44,630
They counted out.

4188
02:41:44,710 --> 02:41:47,330
This is still anybody's game!

4189
02:41:47,970 --> 02:41:48,550
Anybody!

4190
02:41:48,770 --> 02:41:48,790
Oh!

4191
02:41:48,850 --> 02:41:49,450
Another finisher!

4192
02:41:49,610 --> 02:41:50,490
Another finisher!

4193
02:41:50,890 --> 02:41:52,110
Wait for that finisher.

4194
02:41:52,290 --> 02:41:53,190
They missed!

4195
02:41:54,050 --> 02:41:55,210
Oh no!

4196
02:41:58,050 --> 02:41:59,210
Excuse me.

4197
02:41:59,730 --> 02:42:00,310
Okay.

4198
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:03,370
I'm having trouble breathing.

4199
02:42:04,430 --> 02:42:05,590
That's a body slap.

4200
02:42:06,350 --> 02:42:06,930
Okay.

4201
02:42:07,090 --> 02:42:07,710
Wait, let me mute.

4202
02:42:07,710 --> 02:42:08,210
Oh!

4203
02:42:11,230 --> 02:42:12,670
He is about...

4204
02:42:12,670 --> 02:42:15,370
Gerard, my co-caster, is about to die.

4205
02:42:15,430 --> 02:42:15,890
Apparently.

4206
02:42:16,550 --> 02:42:17,030
Oh!

4207
02:42:17,130 --> 02:42:18,570
High-flyer Emilia!

4208
02:42:18,790 --> 02:42:19,130
I'm about to puke.

4209
02:42:19,130 --> 02:42:20,390
There's so much energy going on.

4210
02:42:20,510 --> 02:42:21,390
I can't help it!

4211
02:42:21,490 --> 02:42:21,550
Ah!

4212
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:23,010
Breathe!

4213
02:42:23,150 --> 02:42:23,330
Breathe!

4214
02:42:24,330 --> 02:42:25,090
I'm breathing!

4215
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:25,610
I'm breathing!

4216
02:42:25,950 --> 02:42:26,690
Oh shit!

4217
02:42:26,890 --> 02:42:27,430
Is this it?

4218
02:42:27,430 --> 02:42:29,070
If you don't breathe, Gerard, I'm gonna pin you down!

4219
02:42:29,310 --> 02:42:29,550
Oh!

4220
02:42:29,970 --> 02:42:32,030
That's the same finisher that I got wiped!

4221
02:42:32,290 --> 02:42:33,070
Oh shit!

4222
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:33,610
Oh shit!

4223
02:42:35,410 --> 02:42:36,710
Hit to the back.

4224
02:42:37,710 --> 02:42:37,910
I'm so disrespectful!

4225
02:42:38,550 --> 02:42:39,890
You could've pinned him already!

4226
02:42:40,150 --> 02:42:41,710
But no, you had to do it outside!

4227
02:42:42,070 --> 02:42:42,530
Why?

4228
02:42:42,830 --> 02:42:44,090
The disrespect is immense!

4229
02:42:44,630 --> 02:42:45,850
Can we please just end this?

4230
02:42:46,170 --> 02:42:47,010
Oh, someone's...

4231
02:42:47,010 --> 02:42:47,550
Whee!

4232
02:42:48,870 --> 02:42:52,250
The angel flew around the billion there.

4233
02:42:52,330 --> 02:42:52,630
Why?

4234
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:52,630
Why?

4235
02:42:53,150 --> 02:42:54,010
The disrespect.

4236
02:42:54,290 --> 02:42:55,430
Put an end to it, please!

4237
02:42:56,930 --> 02:42:58,770
They're still fighting inside...

4238
02:42:58,770 --> 02:42:59,330
No, outside.

4239
02:42:59,650 --> 02:43:02,790
They have to get inside or else they're both gonna be disqualified.

4240
02:43:03,110 --> 02:43:03,250
What's the count?

4241
02:43:03,250 --> 02:43:03,250
Five!

4242
02:43:03,390 --> 02:43:04,430
It's five seconds!

4243
02:43:04,690 --> 02:43:05,950
Oh shit, is this it?

4244
02:43:07,710 --> 02:43:08,670
You have to knock him out.

4245
02:43:08,890 --> 02:43:09,390
Stun him!

4246
02:43:09,470 --> 02:43:09,910
Stun him!

4247
02:43:09,970 --> 02:43:10,510
And that's it!

4248
02:43:10,910 --> 02:43:11,750
Yeah, one more stun.

4249
02:43:11,790 --> 02:43:12,650
Why'd you bring it in?

4250
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:12,830
No!

4251
02:43:12,930 --> 02:43:13,450
Come on!

4252
02:43:14,590 --> 02:43:17,270
That was a missed opportunity, but that's a pin!

4253
02:43:17,450 --> 02:43:17,970
It's a pin!

4254
02:43:18,330 --> 02:43:18,990
It could work!

4255
02:43:19,070 --> 02:43:19,270
Might work!

4256
02:43:19,650 --> 02:43:21,830
One... two... three!

4257
02:43:23,690 --> 02:43:24,410
The winner!

4258
02:43:25,190 --> 02:43:25,550
One!

4259
02:43:25,550 --> 02:43:26,090
One!

4260
02:43:26,830 --> 02:43:28,810
Here is your winner!

4261
02:43:29,310 --> 02:43:31,590
One in a billion!

4262
02:43:34,730 --> 02:43:35,350
Billion!

4263
02:43:38,320 --> 02:43:39,450
That was fucking intense.

4264
02:43:39,450 --> 02:43:40,070
That was a really good fight.

4265
02:43:40,930 --> 02:43:42,550
Everyone was like flying!

4266
02:43:42,870 --> 02:43:45,550
They were like throwing punches, like throwing kicks.

4267
02:43:45,730 --> 02:43:47,650
Everyone was throwing each other at... whatever.

4268
02:43:47,870 --> 02:43:49,110
That was fucking fun.

4269
02:43:49,330 --> 02:43:51,690
Holy crap, we got that massive flex.

4270
02:43:52,010 --> 02:43:53,350
We got high fliers.

4271
02:43:53,350 --> 02:43:56,510
And that match is a rating out of... Everything was great.

4272
02:43:56,630 --> 02:43:57,530
Four out of five.

4273
02:43:57,890 --> 02:43:58,450
Amazing.

4274
02:43:58,730 --> 02:43:59,190
Amazing.

4275
02:44:01,230 --> 02:44:03,590
Thank you everybody so much!

4276
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:05,630
The karaoke machine is rated four out of five stars.

4277
02:44:08,710 --> 02:44:09,270
Okay!

4278
02:44:10,190 --> 02:44:12,070
Here we are at the interviewer's table.

4279
02:44:13,250 --> 02:44:14,270
How does it feel?

4280
02:44:14,310 --> 02:44:14,650
Oh, hello!

4281
02:44:15,670 --> 02:44:19,450
How does it feel to beat the... child?

4282
02:44:21,690 --> 02:44:23,330
Why'd you guys freeze it like that?

4283
02:44:26,050 --> 02:44:26,970
Oh my god.

4284
02:44:27,170 --> 02:44:27,490
Listen, okay?

4285
02:44:27,490 --> 02:44:28,650
Stairs are a hell of a drug.

4286
02:44:30,670 --> 02:44:33,430
I'm not trying to say anything, but it was easier than it looked.

4287
02:44:33,570 --> 02:44:34,250
I'm not gonna lie.

4288
02:44:34,730 --> 02:44:35,270
Oh, wow.

4289
02:44:35,790 --> 02:44:38,630
I mean, looking at the match, it seemed very close.

4290
02:44:39,670 --> 02:44:40,190
I don't know.

4291
02:44:40,270 --> 02:44:42,310
Well, you know, I like to put on a good show at the end of the day.

4292
02:44:42,410 --> 02:44:44,830
You know, it's a little bit about giving them a bit of a chance, so...

4293
02:44:44,830 --> 02:44:45,350
The content.

4294
02:44:45,650 --> 02:44:46,350
I get it.

4295
02:44:46,410 --> 02:44:47,010
This makes sense.

4296
02:44:47,350 --> 02:44:47,710
Yeah, yeah.

4297
02:44:47,770 --> 02:44:49,910
I was standing back in the start so I could come back in the ninth.

4298
02:44:50,010 --> 02:44:50,430
You know what I'm saying?

4299
02:44:51,710 --> 02:44:52,390
Yeah, I get it.

4300
02:44:52,410 --> 02:44:52,590
Yo, yo.

4301
02:44:53,350 --> 02:44:53,990
Hold on.

4302
02:44:54,010 --> 02:44:57,090
Yeah, so, Whammy, are you okay?

4303
02:45:00,230 --> 02:45:03,350
The devil may cry, but I cry harder.

4304
02:45:03,610 --> 02:45:03,910
No!

4305
02:45:04,530 --> 02:45:06,930
You made her cry, Fillion!

4306
02:45:07,830 --> 02:45:09,230
Chat, why is she like this?

4307
02:45:09,710 --> 02:45:11,310
I can't... It's all your fault.

4308
02:45:11,430 --> 02:45:13,050
I can't... You made this baby...

4309
02:45:13,050 --> 02:45:15,530
How does it feel like bullying a little girl, huh?

4310
02:45:16,050 --> 02:45:16,990
It's good content.

4311
02:45:16,990 --> 02:45:17,290
You happy?

4312
02:45:18,070 --> 02:45:19,250
I'm a kick streamer.

4313
02:45:19,250 --> 02:45:19,870
What do you want from me?

4314
02:45:20,090 --> 02:45:21,670
I hope you sleep well tonight.

4315
02:45:21,910 --> 02:45:22,450
You know what?

4316
02:45:22,570 --> 02:45:23,330
I hope you sleep well tonight.

4317
02:45:23,330 --> 02:45:24,030
You have a nice day.

4318
02:45:25,050 --> 02:45:26,170
Wow, these threats.

4319
02:45:26,430 --> 02:45:27,210
Very threatening.

4320
02:45:27,410 --> 02:45:28,010
That's very polite.

4321
02:45:28,070 --> 02:45:28,650
Very polite.

4322
02:45:29,050 --> 02:45:29,750
Very polite.

4323
02:45:29,750 --> 02:45:30,610
Very sportsmanlike.

4324
02:45:31,010 --> 02:45:31,590
Don't worry.

4325
02:45:31,670 --> 02:45:32,070
I'm more than open.

4326
02:45:32,270 --> 02:45:32,670
After you.

4327
02:45:32,930 --> 02:45:33,950
I don't believe it.

4328
02:45:36,770 --> 02:45:37,570
Oh, yeah.

4329
02:45:37,570 --> 02:45:39,210
That was peak content, everybody.

4330
02:45:39,490 --> 02:45:39,710
Unfortunately.

4331
02:45:40,310 --> 02:45:41,370
Everyone was flying.

4332
02:45:41,370 --> 02:45:42,450
It was almost...

4333
02:45:42,450 --> 02:45:42,650
That was a really good fight.

4334
02:45:43,030 --> 02:45:44,570
Yeah, it was very close, though.

4335
02:45:44,610 --> 02:45:46,630
Like, everyone was flying, throwing punches and kicks.

4336
02:45:46,790 --> 02:45:50,050
And I honestly thought, like, there were moments like, oh, shit.

4337
02:45:50,530 --> 02:45:51,230
Fillion's gonna win.

4338
02:45:51,330 --> 02:45:52,250
And, oh, shit.

4339
02:45:52,330 --> 02:45:52,910
Ramil's gonna win.

4340
02:45:53,330 --> 02:45:54,830
They were all throwing out their finishers.

4341
02:45:54,870 --> 02:45:56,110
And, holy shit.

4342
02:45:56,230 --> 02:45:58,050
Only one came up on top, though.

4343
02:45:58,170 --> 02:45:58,530
But, yeah.

4344
02:45:58,690 --> 02:46:01,210
Congratulations to you, Fillion.

4345
02:46:01,650 --> 02:46:02,050
Congratulations.

4346
02:46:02,650 --> 02:46:03,110
Thank you.

4347
02:46:03,110 --> 02:46:03,310
Thank you.

4348
02:46:03,310 --> 02:46:03,310
Thank you.

4349
02:46:03,310 --> 02:46:03,450
Thank you.

4350
02:46:03,450 --> 02:46:03,530
Thank you.

4351
02:46:03,530 --> 02:46:03,850
Congrats.

4352
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:05,030
Congrats.

4353
02:46:05,270 --> 02:46:05,590
Yeah.

4354
02:46:05,910 --> 02:46:06,710
You did amazing.

4355
02:46:07,230 --> 02:46:09,510
Even if you are a child beater, but you...

4356
02:46:09,930 --> 02:46:12,050
You can't turn that beat script on me.

4357
02:46:12,310 --> 02:46:13,290
Is it 20 to 1 or is it going to be 20?

4358
02:46:13,290 --> 02:46:14,110
I don't want to be here anymore.

4359
02:46:14,650 --> 02:46:16,650
What do you mean?

4360
02:46:16,670 --> 02:46:17,530
Not the child abuse.

4361
02:46:18,090 --> 02:46:18,570
Stop it.

4362
02:46:18,570 --> 02:46:18,570
Stop it.

4363
02:46:18,570 --> 02:46:18,930
I did it.

4364
02:46:19,070 --> 02:46:19,910
That's not even my fault.

4365
02:46:20,170 --> 02:46:20,730
Stop it.

4366
02:46:20,790 --> 02:46:20,990
Stop it.

4367
02:46:21,850 --> 02:46:23,310
Why did you pull me against the camera?

4368
02:46:23,310 --> 02:46:23,310
You did.

4369
02:46:23,690 --> 02:46:24,850
You did it again.

4370
02:46:24,970 --> 02:46:25,590
What do you expect?

4371
02:46:26,350 --> 02:46:26,970
La la la.

4372
02:46:27,030 --> 02:46:28,310
I am not hearing any of these.

4373
02:46:28,390 --> 02:46:28,890
La la la la.

4374
02:46:30,330 --> 02:46:30,690
Yeah.

4375
02:46:31,030 --> 02:46:31,390
Yeah.

4376
02:46:31,410 --> 02:46:33,710
You know what you sound like?

4377
02:46:33,750 --> 02:46:33,910
Oh, okay.

4378
02:46:34,010 --> 02:46:34,790
You know what you sound like?

4379
02:46:34,870 --> 02:46:35,090
What?

4380
02:46:37,990 --> 02:46:39,110
That's what you sound like.

4381
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:40,450
Oh, my God.

4382
02:46:41,410 --> 02:46:42,310
Peak trash talk.

4383
02:46:42,510 --> 02:46:43,450
Peak trash talk.

4384
02:46:45,730 --> 02:46:47,090
The trash talk is insane.

4385
02:46:47,490 --> 02:46:48,230
And, yeah.

4386
02:46:48,390 --> 02:46:50,270
But that was very entertaining.

4387
02:46:50,590 --> 02:46:50,870
Yeah.

4388
02:46:50,930 --> 02:46:51,330
Thank you.

4389
02:46:51,350 --> 02:46:52,690
Thank you guys so much for that.

4390
02:46:53,350 --> 02:46:54,090
Thank you.

4391
02:46:54,110 --> 02:46:54,830
Thank you.

4392
02:46:54,830 --> 02:46:55,430
The match was really fun.

4393
02:46:55,550 --> 02:46:56,210
Thank you.

4394
02:46:57,070 --> 02:46:58,930
And I can't wait to see what...

4395
02:46:58,930 --> 02:47:00,270
I'm going to do some more gear.

4396
02:47:00,810 --> 02:47:01,210
Yeah.

4397
02:47:01,210 --> 02:47:02,850
I can't wait for the next matchup.

4398
02:47:02,890 --> 02:47:03,690
Like, holy goodness.

4399
02:47:03,810 --> 02:47:05,410
Who else is up there?

4400
02:47:05,430 --> 02:47:06,550
Who is the next matchup?

4401
02:47:06,630 --> 02:47:07,610
Who is the next matchup?

4402
02:47:09,250 --> 02:47:11,010
See you guys in the finals.

4403
02:47:11,510 --> 02:47:12,310
Goodbye forever.

4404
02:47:13,970 --> 02:47:14,370
Bye.

4405
02:47:15,050 --> 02:47:15,650
Bye bye.

4406
02:47:16,150 --> 02:47:16,690
Bye bye.

4407
02:47:17,550 --> 02:47:18,050
Bye bye.

4408
02:47:18,050 --> 02:47:18,190
Bye bye.

4409
02:47:18,570 --> 02:47:18,750
Bye bye.

4410
02:47:18,750 --> 02:47:19,130
Bye bye.

4411
02:47:21,530 --> 02:47:21,930
Bye bye.

4412
02:47:21,930 --> 02:47:21,930
Okay.

4413
02:47:22,330 --> 02:47:22,670
Oh.

4414
02:47:22,670 --> 02:47:24,470
What's the next matchup here?

4415
02:47:24,950 --> 02:47:25,970
I need to know.

4416
02:47:26,790 --> 02:47:28,270
It's getting blocked by the assets.

4417
02:47:28,270 --> 02:47:28,290
Thank you.

4418
02:47:28,310 --> 02:47:30,050
This is behind the scenes right now.

4419
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:30,430
Sorry.

4420
02:47:32,730 --> 02:47:35,350
Thank you for whoever is operating.

4421
02:47:35,490 --> 02:47:36,770
Our next behind the scenes is coming in at the moment.

4422
02:47:38,950 --> 02:47:39,430
Sorry.

4423
02:47:39,470 --> 02:47:41,290
We had some little technical difficulties.

4424
02:47:41,370 --> 02:47:43,970
But here is the next matchup for you guys.

4425
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:45,770
Okay.

4426
02:47:45,770 --> 02:47:46,650
So the next match.

4427
02:47:46,650 --> 02:47:46,670
Everybody, please.

4428
02:47:46,670 --> 02:47:48,350
One for her assistance, please.

4429
02:47:48,530 --> 02:47:48,970
Please.

4430
02:47:48,990 --> 02:47:49,630
Thank you.

4431
02:47:50,370 --> 02:47:51,290
She needs help.

4432
02:47:51,290 --> 02:47:52,030
Next match is going to be...

4433
02:47:52,030 --> 02:47:52,650
Oh, my God.

4434
02:47:52,650 --> 02:47:55,610
Next matchup is going to be another Hall of Stars member.

4435
02:47:57,030 --> 02:47:58,750
Another Hall of Stars member.

4436
02:47:59,130 --> 02:48:00,030
Oh, my God.

4437
02:48:00,050 --> 02:48:00,850
Oh, my goodness.

4438
02:48:01,170 --> 02:48:02,910
Not to be biased or anything.

4439
02:48:03,090 --> 02:48:04,590
But Shinri, you have to win.

4440
02:48:04,670 --> 02:48:05,510
Win Shinri.

4441
02:48:05,690 --> 02:48:07,250
Hall of Stars represent, baby.

4442
02:48:08,350 --> 02:48:09,290
Let's fucking go.

4443
02:48:09,570 --> 02:48:12,190
Good luck to you too, Nagare Sara.

4444
02:48:12,730 --> 02:48:13,150
Sora.

4445
02:48:13,330 --> 02:48:13,530
Wait.

4446
02:48:13,610 --> 02:48:14,250
How do I read that?

4447
02:48:14,570 --> 02:48:15,970
My eyes are weak.

4448
02:48:16,130 --> 02:48:16,990
We have my eyes.

4449
02:48:17,050 --> 02:48:17,910
Is that Sora or Sara?

4450
02:48:18,210 --> 02:48:18,550
Wait.

4451
02:48:18,710 --> 02:48:19,130
Sara.

4452
02:48:19,990 --> 02:48:20,410
Sharescreen.

4453
02:48:20,470 --> 02:48:21,210
There we go.

4454
02:48:21,530 --> 02:48:22,250
Nagare Sara.

4455
02:48:22,250 --> 02:48:22,630
Nagare Sara.

4456
02:48:22,630 --> 02:48:24,710
Good luck to both contestants!

4457
02:48:25,130 --> 02:48:28,250
And I wish them nothing but godspeed.

4458
02:48:29,430 --> 02:48:30,490
For the interview?

4459
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:34,620
Hello?

4460
02:48:36,260 --> 02:48:36,780
Hello?

4461
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:38,080
Hello?

4462
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:39,260
Where is your man?

4463
02:48:40,080 --> 02:48:40,600
Oh.

4464
02:48:40,980 --> 02:48:43,020
Where is your man?

4465
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:43,540
Oh no.

4466
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:44,140
Shinri!

4467
02:48:44,260 --> 02:48:44,740
Shinri!

4468
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:45,140
No!

4469
02:48:45,180 --> 02:48:45,720
Not like this!

4470
02:48:45,800 --> 02:48:48,040
After we glazed you like that!

4471
02:48:48,140 --> 02:48:48,420
Bro!

4472
02:48:48,620 --> 02:48:49,320
You gotta be here!

4473
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:49,940
Oh no!

4474
02:48:49,940 --> 02:48:50,680
He won't be available today.

4475
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:52,120
Oh no!

4476
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:52,720
Oh he has a video!

4477
02:48:53,380 --> 02:48:54,320
Oh no no wait.

4478
02:48:54,700 --> 02:48:55,200
No no no.

4479
02:48:55,420 --> 02:48:56,740
We have him.

4480
02:48:56,860 --> 02:48:57,620
He's here guys.

4481
02:48:57,980 --> 02:48:58,920
He's behind the scenes.

4482
02:48:58,920 --> 02:48:59,800
He's pinging in right now.

4483
02:48:59,800 --> 02:49:00,580
He's here.

4484
02:49:00,860 --> 02:49:01,780
He's here guys.

4485
02:49:02,060 --> 02:49:02,860
Behind the scenes.

4486
02:49:02,920 --> 02:49:03,560
He's pinging in.

4487
02:49:03,660 --> 02:49:04,960
He's at the area.

4488
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:08,440
Can we get him in the voice call right now?

4489
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:09,560
I love it when my senpais are present.

4490
02:49:11,620 --> 02:49:13,260
Bring in the Jumbotron.

4491
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:16,720
Where is it?

4492
02:49:16,760 --> 02:49:17,900
Okay let's get that voice pack going.

4493
02:49:17,960 --> 02:49:18,280
Hello?

4494
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:18,660
Hello?

4495
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:20,380
Shinri?

4496
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:20,820
Sara?

4497
02:49:25,160 --> 02:49:26,260
Is that how he sounds?

4498
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:28,340
It's me.

4499
02:49:28,420 --> 02:49:28,780
It's me.

4500
02:49:28,820 --> 02:49:29,140
It's me.

4501
02:49:29,220 --> 02:49:29,620
I'm real fine.

4502
02:49:29,740 --> 02:49:30,240
I'm real fine.

4503
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:31,680
The illness has forever been the same.

4504
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:33,580
He's been sick recently right?

4505
02:49:34,020 --> 02:49:35,080
I think so yeah.

4506
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:36,340
Okay.

4507
02:49:38,020 --> 02:49:38,420
Shinri.

4508
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:40,320
I think he's a little bit sick.

4509
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:41,600
Forgive us guys.

4510
02:49:41,680 --> 02:49:42,960
He's just a little bit out of the weather.

4511
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:43,660
Yeah.

4512
02:49:43,660 --> 02:49:46,700
There's kind of an epidemic going on in the Hall of Stars.

4513
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:48,620
Introduce yourself Shinri.

4514
02:49:49,960 --> 02:49:51,020
Despite your sickness.

4515
02:49:51,020 --> 02:49:51,560
Yeah.

4516
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:53,680
Do you think...

4517
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:58,860
I can't understand what you're fucking saying!

4518
02:49:59,320 --> 02:50:00,800
I can't understand!

4519
02:50:01,420 --> 02:50:02,320
Everybody quiet!

4520
02:50:03,500 --> 02:50:04,220
What's wrong?

4521
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:04,500
What's wrong?

4522
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:09,100
Introduce yourself man!

4523
02:50:09,780 --> 02:50:10,100
What?

4524
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:11,700
What's the other frequencies of your voice?

4525
02:50:11,980 --> 02:50:12,300
What's the other frequencies of your voice?

4526
02:50:12,300 --> 02:50:14,500
Sara do you think we can get a translation?

4527
02:50:15,240 --> 02:50:15,540
Yeah.

4528
02:50:15,540 --> 02:50:16,300
Joe, Suichi, Shinri.

4529
02:50:16,420 --> 02:50:17,280
Hey Hall of Stars.

4530
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:18,440
Ronan.

4531
02:50:18,460 --> 02:50:19,520
Ronan Hall of Stars.

4532
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:20,000
That's me.

4533
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:20,860
Alright.

4534
02:50:21,100 --> 02:50:25,280
Well may I try and translate that to everyone who can't get anything under a base level.

4535
02:50:25,380 --> 02:50:25,720
Yes please.

4536
02:50:25,720 --> 02:50:28,360
My name's Joe, Suichi, Shinri and I'm gonna get my ass kicked.

4537
02:50:28,980 --> 02:50:29,420
Oh!

4538
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:30,840
Oh!

4539
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:33,740
Are you really gonna take that Shinri?

4540
02:50:33,860 --> 02:50:34,360
Come on!

4541
02:50:34,700 --> 02:50:36,480
Hey listen I don't appreciate that.

4542
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:38,280
I don't like that you said that about me.

4543
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:39,700
Oh I'm sorry.

4544
02:50:39,740 --> 02:50:40,060
I'm sorry.

4545
02:50:40,140 --> 02:50:41,740
Why are you so polite?

4546
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:42,700
Damn!

4547
02:50:42,700 --> 02:50:43,980
Alright Shinri you're gonna first.

4548
02:50:44,080 --> 02:50:45,180
Smack talk him Sara!

4549
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:47,020
No I'm Joe, Suichi, Shinri.

4550
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:48,080
I don't smack talk.

4551
02:50:48,940 --> 02:50:49,940
You say you're a dick.

4552
02:50:49,940 --> 02:50:49,980
I don't smack talk.

4553
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,200
There are two kinds of people that we're looking at here.

4554
02:50:52,320 --> 02:50:53,860
So there's two different situations.

4555
02:50:54,220 --> 02:50:56,740
Like if we walked onto a plane Shinri.

4556
02:50:56,860 --> 02:50:58,860
I would be a pilot and you would be a passenger.

4557
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:00,880
I'm an innovator.

4558
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:02,240
You're an imitator.

4559
02:51:02,380 --> 02:51:05,120
I'm a leader and you are...

4560
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:06,500
You're a follower.

4561
02:51:06,740 --> 02:51:07,860
See I'm a winner.

4562
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:11,200
And everyone else here are losers.

4563
02:51:11,480 --> 02:51:13,600
For believing in one thing.

4564
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:16,700
They believe that Joe, Suichi, Shinri can beat me.

4565
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:17,920
At my own game.

4566
02:51:18,080 --> 02:51:18,920
Are you kidding me?

4567
02:51:19,300 --> 02:51:19,960
Oh my god.

4568
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:20,680
I'm the best.

4569
02:51:20,940 --> 02:51:22,260
At being a pilot?

4570
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:24,000
A pilot?

4571
02:51:24,180 --> 02:51:25,100
Oh my god.

4572
02:51:26,820 --> 02:51:28,420
I'm gonna fly this plane.

4573
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:31,580
And land it directly into that ring.

4574
02:51:31,980 --> 02:51:33,340
On top of that ego.

4575
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:36,560
Because I am going to smash it down into a crisp.

4576
02:51:36,940 --> 02:51:37,280
Woah.

4577
02:51:37,640 --> 02:51:38,240
What is this?

4578
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:38,740
This is a response to you.

4579
02:51:39,320 --> 02:51:43,360
This was a war game.

4580
02:51:43,880 --> 02:51:44,920
Reverse dissing.

4581
02:51:45,080 --> 02:51:46,620
I just don't understand.

4582
02:51:46,620 --> 02:51:48,240
You said you're a good pilot.

4583
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:50,140
And apparently it's got love on the ring.

4584
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:50,820
I don't understand.

4585
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:54,860
And everyone's gonna come out safely onto the tarmac.

4586
02:51:55,080 --> 02:51:55,520
It's a metaphor.

4587
02:51:55,660 --> 02:51:56,820
It's a metaphor Shinri.

4588
02:51:57,420 --> 02:51:58,320
It's a metaphor.

4589
02:51:58,880 --> 02:52:01,300
Okay that's surpassed my knowledge.

4590
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:03,600
He's a little bit sick.

4591
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:04,680
I'm sorry guys.

4592
02:52:04,740 --> 02:52:07,840
A little bit slow.

4593
02:52:09,020 --> 02:52:10,300
Hey I'm not slow.

4594
02:52:10,500 --> 02:52:11,640
I'm fast.

4595
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:13,720
I'm gonna be the quickest one in the ring.

4596
02:52:13,720 --> 02:52:16,180
I guess we'll find out in the match whether you're slow or fast.

4597
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:19,980
The only way that you're getting out of this ring is by tapping out or passing out.

4598
02:52:20,080 --> 02:52:25,500
See my wrestler is a fusion of myself and a very aggressively bogan snake.

4599
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:29,100
And once this boa constricts you, that's it.

4600
02:52:29,820 --> 02:52:30,340
Wow.

4601
02:52:31,020 --> 02:52:34,740
Well the only way you're heading out of this ring is by ambulance.

4602
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:40,060
What happened to the nice guy Shinri?

4603
02:52:40,160 --> 02:52:40,960
I thought you were...

4604
02:52:41,860 --> 02:52:42,900
What happened?

4605
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:45,120
Nobody says that about me.

4606
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:51,620
Yeah I'll be in the ambulance trash talking you while you're in the stretcher.

4607
02:52:51,740 --> 02:52:54,840
So let's see how it goes alright Shinri?

4608
02:52:55,260 --> 02:52:58,260
Let's save the trash talk act for later alright?

4609
02:52:58,520 --> 02:52:59,320
Yeah sounds good.

4610
02:52:59,360 --> 02:52:59,580
Great.

4611
02:52:59,700 --> 02:53:00,480
I'm Josuichi Shinri.

4612
02:53:03,060 --> 02:53:04,620
Definitely Josuichi Shinri here.

4613
02:53:05,800 --> 02:53:06,600
That is him.

4614
02:53:06,700 --> 02:53:07,040
That is him.

4615
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:08,320
I can vouch for him.

4616
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:13,160
Shinri kindly give a koinichiwa to your fans watching here right now for you.

4617
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:13,700
I can vouch for him.

4618
02:53:13,700 --> 02:53:13,700
That is how it goes.

4619
02:53:13,720 --> 02:53:14,860
Oh yeah absolutely.

4620
02:53:15,400 --> 02:53:16,560
Koinichiwa everybody.

4621
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:21,300
Josuichi Shinri here to do a fight and ready to go.

4622
02:53:21,360 --> 02:53:21,840
Feeling great.

4623
02:53:21,940 --> 02:53:22,500
Feeling fresh.

4624
02:53:23,470 --> 02:53:24,680
Yeah let's fucking go.

4625
02:53:25,080 --> 02:53:26,300
Let's fucking go everybody!

4626
02:53:26,780 --> 02:53:31,760
The match of the century between a plane and a ronin.

4627
02:53:31,980 --> 02:53:33,200
Let's see who comes out first.

4628
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:35,740
A plane and a ronin.

4629
02:53:36,300 --> 02:53:38,120
That's what I got from the entire conversation.

4630
02:53:38,220 --> 02:53:38,640
Sorry.

4631
02:53:38,740 --> 02:53:41,200
I am flak on.

4632
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:43,480
Let's go back into the ring.

4633
02:53:43,480 --> 02:53:44,640
Let's go!

4634
02:53:44,660 --> 02:53:45,220
And the next match.

4635
02:53:45,740 --> 02:53:48,460
Bulk Bogan and Shinri.

4636
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:49,880
What the?

4637
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:51,800
What in the scuba diver?

4638
02:53:52,360 --> 02:53:54,740
Why is there a scuba diver here?

4639
02:53:55,180 --> 02:53:56,980
Shinri what happened?

4640
02:53:57,380 --> 02:53:58,080
What?

4641
02:53:58,540 --> 02:54:00,260
What is that pose?

4642
02:54:01,160 --> 02:54:03,140
Bulk Bogan on that huge bulk.

4643
02:54:03,160 --> 02:54:05,580
And Shinri diving in that deep.

4644
02:54:05,660 --> 02:54:06,560
My goodness.

4645
02:54:06,700 --> 02:54:09,220
Bulk Bogan in a pilot outfit too?

4646
02:54:09,580 --> 02:54:10,180
Damn.

4647
02:54:10,180 --> 02:54:14,300
I gotta say though, Shinri is on Brad because he's creeping up on them opponents like sneaky style.

4648
02:54:14,440 --> 02:54:15,760
Like one of his horror games.

4649
02:54:16,080 --> 02:54:17,360
He's into that one, right?

4650
02:54:17,480 --> 02:54:22,060
The following contest is scheduled for one fall!

4651
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:26,560
Introducing first...

4652
02:54:27,220 --> 02:54:28,860
Oh shit we got a toxic man.

4653
02:54:28,900 --> 02:54:29,420
Representing...

4654
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:32,140
Someone harder than the Sahara...

4655
02:54:32,140 --> 02:54:34,200
From where things get gory...

4656
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:36,620
The gory Sarah...

4657
02:54:38,140 --> 02:54:38,660
BULK!

4658
02:54:39,180 --> 02:54:39,700
BULK!

4659
02:54:40,180 --> 02:54:41,200
BULK BOOGOOOOON!

4660
02:54:43,780 --> 02:54:45,840
Thank you so much announcer Thank you so much announcer, that was great.

4661
02:54:45,980 --> 02:54:47,060
Thank you thank you...

4662
02:54:47,060 --> 02:54:50,540
And I can't help but look at the fucking toxic one in the jumbo truck.

4663
02:54:50,680 --> 02:54:52,100
Look at that what the hell?

4664
02:54:52,680 --> 02:54:55,100
Very vocal about the intentions here.

4665
02:54:55,240 --> 02:54:57,540
Out here to destroy Shinri.

4666
02:54:57,660 --> 02:54:59,000
Poison... Just poison air.

4667
02:54:59,160 --> 02:54:59,960
Not joking around.

4668
02:55:00,280 --> 02:55:02,160
Bulk Bogan showing up!

4669
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:03,760
And oh my god!

4670
02:55:04,500 --> 02:55:05,780
With a thunderous entrance.

4671
02:55:06,460 --> 02:55:07,180
Squatting down.

4672
02:55:07,640 --> 02:55:10,160
And announcing to the world that he is the...

4673
02:55:10,180 --> 02:55:10,540
She is here!

4674
02:55:11,780 --> 02:55:14,340
Bulk Bogan better be thankful that she's not a ghost.

4675
02:55:14,940 --> 02:55:16,060
Oh my goodness.

4676
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:18,500
This character reminds me...

4677
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:20,380
Yeah, it reminds me of like...

4678
02:55:22,080 --> 02:55:22,540
Hercules.

4679
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:23,300
Oh my god.

4680
02:55:23,940 --> 02:55:24,760
What is this?

4681
02:55:25,460 --> 02:55:25,920
Intense.

4682
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:26,340
What are you doing?

4683
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:27,120
What are you doing?

4684
02:55:27,700 --> 02:55:28,980
Go to the ring!

4685
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:29,940
You need to walk!

4686
02:55:29,980 --> 02:55:32,340
An intimidation factor towards Shin...

4687
02:55:32,340 --> 02:55:33,060
Oh, what the hell?

4688
02:55:33,320 --> 02:55:33,780
Ayo!

4689
02:55:33,880 --> 02:55:34,260
Ayo!

4690
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:35,500
Ayo!

4691
02:55:35,640 --> 02:55:36,700
Someone's crawling too!

4692
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:37,620
What the...

4693
02:55:38,260 --> 02:55:40,380
Is that the impersonation of a snake?

4694
02:55:40,760 --> 02:55:41,600
What's going on?

4695
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:42,820
Is that how a pilot walks?

4696
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:43,800
Oh...

4697
02:55:44,860 --> 02:55:46,200
Come on man, fly!

4698
02:55:46,580 --> 02:55:46,820
Fly!

4699
02:55:47,320 --> 02:55:47,940
Come on, move!

4700
02:55:49,300 --> 02:55:50,300
They're not moving.

4701
02:55:50,520 --> 02:55:53,260
This is probably the longest...

4702
02:55:53,260 --> 02:55:53,780
Fly towards the ring!

4703
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:54,980
Like you said!

4704
02:55:56,320 --> 02:55:57,100
There we go.

4705
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:57,620
There we go.

4706
02:55:57,900 --> 02:55:59,700
The landing sure is something.

4707
02:56:00,760 --> 02:56:01,800
big necktie.

4708
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:04,820
It's really wide.

4709
02:56:05,560 --> 02:56:07,280
The short shorts be doing something.

4710
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:09,420
Oh wow, wow.

4711
02:56:09,500 --> 02:56:10,440
Oh, what the...

4712
02:56:10,440 --> 02:56:12,220
Oh, look at that gato.

4713
02:56:12,480 --> 02:56:13,300
You get that zettai ryoiki?

4714
02:56:14,020 --> 02:56:14,540
Bro!

4715
02:56:17,940 --> 02:56:18,460
Ayo.

4716
02:56:18,940 --> 02:56:21,640
They're still sticking to the animalistic behavior though.

4717
02:56:22,440 --> 02:56:24,200
This is a really long intro.

4718
02:56:24,860 --> 02:56:25,700
Yes it is.

4719
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:27,920
There's a lot of parts to this choreography.

4720
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:29,280
Oh!

4721
02:56:29,540 --> 02:56:30,820
Oh wow, wow!

4722
02:56:31,940 --> 02:56:33,140
Getting the crowd pumped.

4723
02:56:35,860 --> 02:56:36,380
Hehehe.

4724
02:56:36,380 --> 02:56:36,880
Hehehe.

4725
02:56:37,620 --> 02:56:39,780
What she's gonna probably do to Shinri is a pump and dump.

4726
02:56:39,900 --> 02:56:40,820
Is what I'm talking about.

4727
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:42,140
Oh ho ho ho ho!

4728
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:43,480
Okay!

4729
02:56:44,100 --> 02:56:46,040
A quick pump and dump him down.

4730
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:49,400
I hope that's the finisher of their moves.

4731
02:56:52,060 --> 02:56:54,400
Oh no, I think Shinri might mistake her for a...

4732
02:56:54,400 --> 02:56:55,740
for a monster or something.

4733
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:57,060
For a ghost or ghoulie.

4734
02:56:57,140 --> 02:56:58,200
What is happening here?

4735
02:56:58,200 --> 02:56:59,320
It's still going on?

4736
02:56:59,440 --> 02:57:00,200
What the hell?

4737
02:57:00,320 --> 02:57:01,900
Oh my god!

4738
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:03,200
You're still crawling?

4739
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:04,180
Stop it!

4740
02:57:04,320 --> 02:57:05,260
We get it!

4741
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:05,740
Hahaha!

4742
02:57:08,080 --> 02:57:08,500
Rrrr!

4743
02:57:08,500 --> 02:57:08,920
Rrrr!

4744
02:57:09,580 --> 02:57:10,000
Rrrr!

4745
02:57:11,140 --> 02:57:13,000
I'm... I'm... I'm a pilot.

4746
02:57:15,240 --> 02:57:16,640
That's definitely not good for her back.

4747
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:18,160
There's still... okay.

4748
02:57:18,300 --> 02:57:18,900
Okay, is it done?

4749
02:57:19,160 --> 02:57:19,580
Oooh!

4750
02:57:20,080 --> 02:57:21,460
Oh wow, there's a zoom out too.

4751
02:57:21,540 --> 02:57:21,680
You gotta have to do a chromia.

4752
02:57:24,060 --> 02:57:24,480
Kinda.

4753
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:25,880
Oh wow.

4754
02:57:26,260 --> 02:57:26,940
It's still going!

4755
02:57:27,240 --> 02:57:28,060
She's gonna crawl again.

4756
02:57:28,100 --> 02:57:28,400
Look at her.

4757
02:57:28,600 --> 02:57:28,900
Hahaha!

4758
02:57:29,840 --> 02:57:33,280
I swear to god if we went into commercial break right now, it's still going.

4759
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:34,440
Yeah, yeah.

4760
02:57:35,260 --> 02:57:35,700
Here we go!

4761
02:57:35,700 --> 02:57:37,860
Introducing their opponent...

4762
02:57:39,720 --> 02:57:45,120
on a boy failure spree, the bloated rodent...

4763
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:48,020
Josuiji Shinri!

4764
02:57:48,020 --> 02:57:48,240
Rrrr!

4765
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:52,760
I got shot there.

4766
02:57:52,900 --> 02:57:53,100
Ow.

4767
02:57:53,420 --> 02:57:54,860
Why'd you have to say that now, sir?

4768
02:57:54,980 --> 02:57:56,280
I like how I see his briefs.

4769
02:57:56,840 --> 02:57:57,440
Hahaha!

4770
02:57:58,140 --> 02:58:00,880
And there's a shirt saying KO!

4771
02:58:01,400 --> 02:58:03,160
Declaring victory right at once.

4772
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:04,600
Without even saying it.

4773
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:05,160
It's his coin!

4774
02:58:05,260 --> 02:58:06,160
It's an upside down eye!

4775
02:58:06,160 --> 02:58:06,920
We got like a fishnet!

4776
02:58:07,220 --> 02:58:07,720
Fishnet!

4777
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:08,320
Oh wow!

4778
02:58:08,480 --> 02:58:08,980
Oh Shinri.

4779
02:58:09,860 --> 02:58:11,660
Yep, Shinri does that on the daily.

4780
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:14,800
Shinri... showing up.

4781
02:58:15,340 --> 02:58:15,840
And...

4782
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:17,480
He'd be on that hip set grind set.

4783
02:58:18,020 --> 02:58:18,520
Hahaha!

4784
02:58:22,740 --> 02:58:25,260
And finally are we up to the match?

4785
02:58:25,380 --> 02:58:26,220
Who's gonna win?

4786
02:58:26,340 --> 02:58:28,700
Will Shinri be able to snorkel his way to victory?

4787
02:58:29,880 --> 02:58:32,160
Shinri versus Sora!

4788
02:58:34,500 --> 02:58:35,140
Let's go!

4789
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:36,600
Let's go!

4790
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:37,480
And already at the grapple.

4791
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:38,060
The referee!

4792
02:58:38,280 --> 02:58:39,260
What the fuck are you doing, referee?

4793
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:41,080
Referee's just running around.

4794
02:58:41,300 --> 02:58:45,160
And immediately, first one to the ground is Sara!

4795
02:58:45,720 --> 02:58:46,780
Kick into the chest.

4796
02:58:47,820 --> 02:58:48,220
Chest?

4797
02:58:48,420 --> 02:58:48,880
I don't know.

4798
02:58:49,260 --> 02:58:51,560
Kidney, kidney, there we go.

4799
02:58:51,700 --> 02:58:52,960
You know about that.

4800
02:58:53,020 --> 02:58:54,380
You know stuff about kidneys, right?

4801
02:58:54,980 --> 02:58:55,520
Yeah, I...

4802
02:58:55,520 --> 02:58:56,080
Can produce stones?

4803
02:58:56,300 --> 02:58:56,780
Kidney stones?

4804
02:58:57,060 --> 02:58:57,980
Okay, okay, that's enough.

4805
02:58:58,020 --> 02:58:58,800
That's enough, Octavio.

4806
02:58:58,800 --> 02:58:59,340
That's enough.

4807
02:58:59,400 --> 02:59:01,240
We're here for Shinri and Sara.

4808
02:59:01,580 --> 02:59:02,140
Okay, okay.

4809
02:59:02,140 --> 02:59:03,880
We're not here to talk about my medical history.

4810
02:59:04,060 --> 02:59:05,280
Thank you very much.

4811
02:59:05,440 --> 02:59:05,900
Oh!

4812
02:59:06,320 --> 02:59:07,460
Knee to the face!

4813
02:59:07,860 --> 02:59:09,080
Knee to the face!

4814
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:09,420
Ooh!

4815
02:59:10,760 --> 02:59:11,320
Disrespect!

4816
02:59:11,380 --> 02:59:11,940
Ooh!

4817
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:12,220
Kicks!

4818
02:59:12,520 --> 02:59:14,340
Three consecutive kicks!

4819
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:16,040
Ooh!

4820
02:59:16,040 --> 02:59:16,540
Ow!

4821
02:59:16,840 --> 02:59:17,080
Ooh!

4822
02:59:17,500 --> 02:59:18,540
Focusing on the arm.

4823
02:59:18,780 --> 02:59:19,340
Ooh!

4824
02:59:19,420 --> 02:59:19,820
Damn!

4825
02:59:20,460 --> 02:59:21,940
Kind in the streets!

4826
02:59:22,580 --> 02:59:24,400
Shinri is very aggressive with these blows!

4827
02:59:24,640 --> 02:59:26,540
And a knee to the body as well!

4828
02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:27,820
Ah, wee.

4829
02:59:28,060 --> 02:59:28,440
Ah!

4830
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:29,480
That's a disrespect!

4831
02:59:29,480 --> 02:59:30,840
That snorkeling truly has been helpful for him.

4832
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:31,260
It just keeps going!

4833
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:32,840
This is one-sided.

4834
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:34,680
One-sided matchup.

4835
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:36,620
And all that gloating a while ago... Come on, Sara!

4836
02:59:36,620 --> 02:59:38,560
Sara, what happened to the landing part?

4837
02:59:38,780 --> 02:59:39,720
You never landed!

4838
02:59:39,720 --> 02:59:40,940
You're crashing down!

4839
02:59:41,620 --> 02:59:42,040
Try!

4840
02:59:42,040 --> 02:59:42,280
Try!

4841
02:59:42,280 --> 02:59:42,320
Try!

4842
02:59:42,320 --> 02:59:42,780
And ooh!

4843
02:59:43,060 --> 02:59:43,580
Ah!

4844
02:59:44,280 --> 02:59:45,560
Ooh, not the fingies!

4845
02:59:45,820 --> 02:59:47,780
The fingies and to the back!

4846
02:59:47,880 --> 02:59:48,360
Ooh!

4847
02:59:48,480 --> 02:59:49,180
And the back!

4848
02:59:50,280 --> 02:59:52,700
Ooh, those psoas muscles are gonna hurt tomorrow.

4849
02:59:52,720 --> 02:59:53,360
Ah, miss!

4850
02:59:53,420 --> 02:59:54,600
Oh, miss the dive!

4851
02:59:54,640 --> 02:59:56,160
Possibly a counter by Sara.

4852
02:59:56,920 --> 02:59:57,620
Got up.

4853
02:59:57,840 --> 02:59:58,360
Grapple!

4854
02:59:58,800 --> 02:59:59,620
Kick to the stomach!

4855
03:00:00,580 --> 03:00:01,580
And a throw!

4856
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:02,140
It's a throw!

4857
03:00:02,440 --> 03:00:02,780
Oh!

4858
03:00:04,300 --> 03:00:05,940
It's a weird suplex thing.

4859
03:00:06,160 --> 03:00:07,120
Another grapple!

4860
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:08,840
And knee to the face!

4861
03:00:08,900 --> 03:00:10,120
Knee to the face in his face!

4862
03:00:10,240 --> 03:00:12,080
A beautiful face of Shinri.

4863
03:00:12,080 --> 03:00:14,440
A comeback is probably imminent.

4864
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:15,640
Ooh, submission.

4865
03:00:15,900 --> 03:00:16,000
Oh!

4866
03:00:17,500 --> 03:00:17,940
No!

4867
03:00:18,100 --> 03:00:18,940
It wasn't a submission.

4868
03:00:19,120 --> 03:00:21,160
It was a slam to the arms.

4869
03:00:21,780 --> 03:00:23,080
Aiming for those weak spots.

4870
03:00:23,260 --> 03:00:24,960
That would have resulted in a dislocated shoulder for Shinri.

4871
03:00:26,480 --> 03:00:27,500
Oh, what is happening?

4872
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:28,040
What is happening?

4873
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:30,660
I don't even get to see it, but that's probably painful.

4874
03:00:30,840 --> 03:00:31,560
Hey, that's foul.

4875
03:00:31,780 --> 03:00:33,060
You know Shinri has aches and...

4876
03:00:33,060 --> 03:00:33,800
Oh!

4877
03:00:33,960 --> 03:00:34,740
Using the corner like that!

4878
03:00:34,780 --> 03:00:35,240
Is it?

4879
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:37,080
Oh, and the... didn't even consider the counts.

4880
03:00:37,420 --> 03:00:37,460
Nice, nice.

4881
03:00:37,860 --> 03:00:38,440
Shoulders up.

4882
03:00:38,480 --> 03:00:39,920
Shinri's still pumping up with life.

4883
03:00:40,120 --> 03:00:41,580
Look at this heel hook!

4884
03:00:42,500 --> 03:00:43,960
And taking off the shoes!

4885
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:44,160
He's still full of life.

4886
03:00:44,300 --> 03:00:45,540
Sara, what are you doing?

4887
03:00:46,040 --> 03:00:47,660
Don't take off the shoes, please!

4888
03:00:48,160 --> 03:00:49,020
Please don't!

4889
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:49,300
Stop!

4890
03:00:49,400 --> 03:00:49,520
Stop!

4891
03:00:49,540 --> 03:00:50,660
Stop taking his kicks!

4892
03:00:50,720 --> 03:00:52,680
We know what happens when the shoes come off!

4893
03:00:53,680 --> 03:00:54,780
You see the toes!

4894
03:00:55,360 --> 03:00:56,440
You see the stinky!

4895
03:00:56,440 --> 03:00:57,220
Oh!

4896
03:00:57,920 --> 03:00:58,440
Ow!

4897
03:00:59,920 --> 03:01:00,740
Sniffle, sniffle!

4898
03:01:01,580 --> 03:01:02,100
Oh!

4899
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:02,480
Oh!

4900
03:01:02,520 --> 03:01:02,980
Oh!

4901
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:03,140
Oh!

4902
03:01:03,140 --> 03:01:03,280
Oh!

4903
03:01:03,780 --> 03:01:05,260
Surprisingly athletic!

4904
03:01:05,480 --> 03:01:06,820
We have Sara here!

4905
03:01:07,020 --> 03:01:08,620
He can breathe through those feet!

4906
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,280
I didn't think you'd be doing those types of moves.

4907
03:01:11,620 --> 03:01:12,140
Oh!

4908
03:01:12,960 --> 03:01:13,620
Grab him!

4909
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:14,940
Sara with the advantage!

4910
03:01:15,140 --> 03:01:15,940
Got a counter!

4911
03:01:16,420 --> 03:01:17,200
Nice reversal!

4912
03:01:17,260 --> 03:01:19,560
And missed!

4913
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:21,080
He missed the clothesline!

4914
03:01:21,180 --> 03:01:21,680
He's blind!

4915
03:01:22,220 --> 03:01:23,260
Shinri, come on!

4916
03:01:23,280 --> 03:01:24,480
And they flew out!

4917
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:26,420
Okay, so...

4918
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:26,860
Okay, follow up.

4919
03:01:26,940 --> 03:01:29,100
You need to remove your snorkeling gear!

4920
03:01:29,180 --> 03:01:29,560
You can't see!

4921
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:30,820
You can't see!

4922
03:01:30,900 --> 03:01:33,720
I think that's gonna debuff your uh... your movement, buddy!

4923
03:01:33,900 --> 03:01:34,040
Oh!

4924
03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:34,360
Oh!

4925
03:01:34,700 --> 03:01:35,000
Ow!

4926
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:35,720
Ow!

4927
03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:37,820
Face to the mat!

4928
03:01:38,380 --> 03:01:40,800
They really do love fighting outside!

4929
03:01:41,080 --> 03:01:42,100
Don't they, Octavio?

4930
03:01:42,700 --> 03:01:43,300
Yeah, yeah.

4931
03:01:43,380 --> 03:01:45,320
They really like it outside in the air.

4932
03:01:45,460 --> 03:01:47,160
And the fucking taunt is insane!

4933
03:01:48,080 --> 03:01:48,480
Sara!

4934
03:01:48,480 --> 03:01:49,080
In front of the crowd!

4935
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:50,960
Hyping up the crowd!

4936
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:52,200
I don't know if they're booing or not!

4937
03:01:52,320 --> 03:01:52,520
Oh!

4938
03:01:53,160 --> 03:01:53,560
CPR!

4939
03:01:53,740 --> 03:01:54,880
So fucking sinister!

4940
03:01:54,900 --> 03:01:55,860
We got CPR going on!

4941
03:01:56,440 --> 03:01:57,340
Two inches deep!

4942
03:02:00,870 --> 03:02:01,230
Bruh.

4943
03:02:01,270 --> 03:02:02,030
Hit in the center!

4944
03:02:02,110 --> 03:02:02,810
Okay, we go back to the ring.

4945
03:02:03,090 --> 03:02:04,870
This is actually a very even fight.

4946
03:02:04,990 --> 03:02:06,050
I'm not sure who will win.

4947
03:02:06,670 --> 03:02:07,510
Yeah, me too.

4948
03:02:07,670 --> 03:02:08,090
I don't know.

4949
03:02:08,230 --> 03:02:10,090
They're like doing a back and forth here.

4950
03:02:10,350 --> 03:02:17,870
I think that's gonna be a common theme from now on, considering probably the best fighters are gonna be at the last segment of the show.

4951
03:02:18,390 --> 03:02:18,750
Oh!

4952
03:02:18,750 --> 03:02:19,110
Oh!

4953
03:02:19,170 --> 03:02:19,430
Maybe.

4954
03:02:19,950 --> 03:02:20,490
You think?

4955
03:02:20,670 --> 03:02:20,990
Oh!

4956
03:02:21,590 --> 03:02:21,950
Owie!

4957
03:02:24,130 --> 03:02:26,190
They really do like fighting in the corners, huh?

4958
03:02:26,190 --> 03:02:26,290
Oh!

4959
03:02:26,390 --> 03:02:26,790
Ah!

4960
03:02:27,190 --> 03:02:28,070
What is that?

4961
03:02:28,090 --> 03:02:31,050
That required so much strength to do!

4962
03:02:31,090 --> 03:02:31,770
Was that a finisher?

4963
03:02:31,950 --> 03:02:32,290
Oh no!

4964
03:02:33,250 --> 03:02:35,050
They have really good endurance though.

4965
03:02:35,130 --> 03:02:35,490
Just the one count.

4966
03:02:36,130 --> 03:02:37,130
Yeah, just the one count.

4967
03:02:37,130 --> 03:02:38,550
Every time they pin, it's just one.

4968
03:02:39,990 --> 03:02:40,790
And a throw!

4969
03:02:40,870 --> 03:02:41,250
Suplex!

4970
03:02:42,670 --> 03:02:43,390
Suplex city!

4971
03:02:46,690 --> 03:02:47,150
Okay.

4972
03:02:47,210 --> 03:02:47,670
What's happening?

4973
03:02:47,810 --> 03:02:48,270
Ooh!

4974
03:02:48,870 --> 03:02:49,830
Analyzing the competition.

4975
03:02:50,290 --> 03:02:51,110
Knee to the face.

4976
03:02:51,730 --> 03:02:53,030
You love to see it.

4977
03:02:53,070 --> 03:02:53,770
Is this a finisher?

4978
03:02:53,770 --> 03:02:54,710
Is this it?

4979
03:02:54,830 --> 03:02:54,950
Oh man!

4980
03:02:55,430 --> 03:02:56,730
Oh no it isn't!

4981
03:02:56,990 --> 03:02:58,010
Throwing on the ropes.

4982
03:02:58,190 --> 03:02:59,390
It's just a rope choke.

4983
03:03:00,310 --> 03:03:01,330
Look at this!

4984
03:03:01,330 --> 03:03:02,170
What is happening?

4985
03:03:02,270 --> 03:03:02,690
Ooh!

4986
03:03:02,690 --> 03:03:02,850
Submission!

4987
03:03:03,070 --> 03:03:03,690
Submission move.

4988
03:03:04,270 --> 03:03:05,130
That's gotta hurt.

4989
03:03:05,330 --> 03:03:06,370
That hurts the hamstrings.

4990
03:03:06,670 --> 03:03:07,550
The gastrocnemius.

4991
03:03:08,970 --> 03:03:11,010
You're very knowledgeable about the body parts.

4992
03:03:11,510 --> 03:03:11,990
You're very knowledgeable about the body parts.

4993
03:03:11,990 --> 03:03:13,170
Lots of lactic acid buildup.

4994
03:03:14,270 --> 03:03:14,750
Lactic?

4995
03:03:14,830 --> 03:03:16,590
I don't see any acid, but sure buddy.

4996
03:03:16,830 --> 03:03:17,630
And there's a pin!

4997
03:03:18,050 --> 03:03:19,250
Oh, now it's a pin.

4998
03:03:19,370 --> 03:03:21,170
I don't see any acid, but you see a bunch of lactation.

4999
03:03:22,950 --> 03:03:23,670
Well no!

5000
03:03:23,770 --> 03:03:24,210
No!

5001
03:03:24,270 --> 03:03:24,270
No!

5002
03:03:24,310 --> 03:03:25,450
What are you talking about?

5003
03:03:25,670 --> 03:03:27,610
No one's lactating anywhere here, Octavio.

5004
03:03:27,710 --> 03:03:28,070
Oh!

5005
03:03:28,430 --> 03:03:29,190
Oh finisher!

5006
03:03:30,410 --> 03:03:30,810
Finisher!

5007
03:03:30,810 --> 03:03:31,470
Oh nice finisher.

5008
03:03:31,630 --> 03:03:33,150
Is this the famous nipple twister?

5009
03:03:33,810 --> 03:03:34,370
Is it?

5010
03:03:34,970 --> 03:03:35,610
Oh no!

5011
03:03:35,690 --> 03:03:35,950
It's not!

5012
03:03:36,110 --> 03:03:36,610
It's not!

5013
03:03:36,830 --> 03:03:37,950
His chin's being twisted!

5014
03:03:38,310 --> 03:03:38,690
Oh no!

5015
03:03:38,950 --> 03:03:39,670
It's a face!

5016
03:03:39,710 --> 03:03:40,350
It's the chin!

5017
03:03:40,710 --> 03:03:41,550
Is this a tap?

5018
03:03:41,730 --> 03:03:43,130
Is this a tap?

5019
03:03:43,510 --> 03:03:44,530
Is this a tap?

5020
03:03:44,790 --> 03:03:45,670
Oh no!

5021
03:03:45,790 --> 03:03:46,350
No, no, no.

5022
03:03:46,450 --> 03:03:47,010
They got away.

5023
03:03:47,530 --> 03:03:47,930
Almost.

5024
03:03:48,410 --> 03:03:49,950
You should have attacked the nipples instead.

5025
03:03:50,630 --> 03:03:52,810
Yeah, I think that would be an immediate tap out.

5026
03:03:54,630 --> 03:03:55,110
Oh!

5027
03:03:55,590 --> 03:03:56,070
Oh!

5028
03:03:56,730 --> 03:03:57,450
What's happening?

5029
03:03:57,470 --> 03:03:58,970
Is this it?

5030
03:03:58,990 --> 03:03:59,470
Is this it?

5031
03:04:00,150 --> 03:04:00,630
No?

5032
03:04:00,870 --> 03:04:01,230
Okay.

5033
03:04:01,230 --> 03:04:01,350
I thought that was it.

5034
03:04:01,350 --> 03:04:02,450
Stimulating the feeling of drowning.

5035
03:04:02,910 --> 03:04:06,130
I'm expecting finishers here because they've been dishing out like a lot of hits.

5036
03:04:06,310 --> 03:04:06,770
Oh!

5037
03:04:07,350 --> 03:04:10,150
They've probably been charged up like a long time ago.

5038
03:04:10,330 --> 03:04:10,670
What the heck?

5039
03:04:12,170 --> 03:04:13,830
Trying to escape through the ropes.

5040
03:04:14,330 --> 03:04:15,470
We got Sarah here.

5041
03:04:16,230 --> 03:04:16,710
Groggy.

5042
03:04:17,190 --> 03:04:18,230
And aww!

5043
03:04:18,390 --> 03:04:18,870
Punch!

5044
03:04:18,890 --> 03:04:21,170
A disrespectful hit to the face.

5045
03:04:21,190 --> 03:04:22,190
And they're joining.

5046
03:04:22,290 --> 03:04:23,170
What is happening?

5047
03:04:23,970 --> 03:04:24,410
Oh my!

5048
03:04:25,070 --> 03:04:25,510
Oh!

5049
03:04:26,750 --> 03:04:27,990
Straight to the buttocks.

5050
03:04:28,070 --> 03:04:30,550
Sarah's back is gonna be splitting two after that.

5051
03:04:30,690 --> 03:04:31,750
And that fucking taunt!

5052
03:04:31,770 --> 03:04:32,470
Ah, wee!

5053
03:04:32,750 --> 03:04:34,250
Are you gonna take that, Sarah?

5054
03:04:34,390 --> 03:04:35,390
I don't think you should.

5055
03:04:35,470 --> 03:04:37,830
I think you better be fighting back here.

5056
03:04:37,890 --> 03:04:40,230
At any moment or else this is gonna be the end of you.

5057
03:04:40,430 --> 03:04:40,710
Ooh!

5058
03:04:41,410 --> 03:04:42,110
There we go.

5059
03:04:42,250 --> 03:04:43,150
It's Sarah's comeback.

5060
03:04:43,970 --> 03:04:44,650
Comeback moment.

5061
03:04:45,650 --> 03:04:46,310
Grapple again.

5062
03:04:46,570 --> 03:04:47,610
And inside the ring.

5063
03:04:48,310 --> 03:04:49,350
Okay, what's Sarah gonna do?

5064
03:04:49,450 --> 03:04:50,130
Are they gonna recover?

5065
03:04:50,270 --> 03:04:51,330
Is Shiri gonna recover in time?

5066
03:04:51,330 --> 03:04:51,890
Oh no!

5067
03:04:52,350 --> 03:04:52,950
Oh, Sarah took off!

5068
03:04:52,950 --> 03:04:53,590
Recover in time.

5069
03:04:54,850 --> 03:04:55,890
Like a plane!

5070
03:04:57,910 --> 03:04:58,470
Okay.

5071
03:04:59,070 --> 03:04:59,630
Oh!

5072
03:04:59,790 --> 03:05:00,310
Ooh!

5073
03:05:00,610 --> 03:05:03,050
The goggles add extra damage!

5074
03:05:03,590 --> 03:05:05,310
That's gonna sink into your eye sockets.

5075
03:05:05,310 --> 03:05:06,210
The right foot was a blade that wagged on Shinri's face.

5076
03:05:07,210 --> 03:05:08,050
Oh wee.

5077
03:05:08,250 --> 03:05:08,870
Oh wee.

5078
03:05:09,130 --> 03:05:09,690
Oh.

5079
03:05:10,170 --> 03:05:10,990
The stun.

5080
03:05:11,210 --> 03:05:12,710
The stun meter is almost up.

5081
03:05:12,890 --> 03:05:13,330
Ah!

5082
03:05:13,850 --> 03:05:15,110
Not in joints!

5083
03:05:15,110 --> 03:05:15,490
Oh!

5084
03:05:15,890 --> 03:05:16,990
And they are stunned.

5085
03:05:17,310 --> 03:05:18,230
This is it.

5086
03:05:18,230 --> 03:05:19,070
I think this is the moment.

5087
03:05:19,530 --> 03:05:20,210
Arthritis tomorrow.

5088
03:05:20,510 --> 03:05:21,070
This is it.

5089
03:05:21,070 --> 03:05:21,470
This is it.

5090
03:05:21,470 --> 03:05:22,350
I think this is the finisher.

5091
03:05:22,510 --> 03:05:22,850
Oh!

5092
03:05:23,010 --> 03:05:23,310
Pin!

5093
03:05:23,630 --> 03:05:24,590
I think this is the pin!

5094
03:05:25,310 --> 03:05:25,810
Oh no!

5095
03:05:25,830 --> 03:05:26,290
What are you doing?

5096
03:05:26,450 --> 03:05:27,570
Sarah, what the fuck are you doing?

5097
03:05:27,690 --> 03:05:28,150
She's standing down.

5098
03:05:28,350 --> 03:05:28,930
No, wait!

5099
03:05:29,090 --> 03:05:29,830
That's my senpai.

5100
03:05:29,830 --> 03:05:30,530
No, don't pin him down.

5101
03:05:30,590 --> 03:05:30,970
Don't pin him down.

5102
03:05:31,050 --> 03:05:31,170
Oh!

5103
03:05:31,230 --> 03:05:31,590
There's blood!

5104
03:05:31,870 --> 03:05:32,210
No!

5105
03:05:33,130 --> 03:05:33,810
Shinri's bloodied!

5106
03:05:34,970 --> 03:05:36,010
The beautiful face!

5107
03:05:36,590 --> 03:05:37,530
Now this is combobulated.

5108
03:05:37,530 --> 03:05:38,710
You sure not wore that fucking...

5109
03:05:38,710 --> 03:05:40,230
Oh no, Shinri.

5110
03:05:40,290 --> 03:05:41,050
This is all your fault.

5111
03:05:41,090 --> 03:05:41,590
You're gonna lose.

5112
03:05:41,970 --> 03:05:42,310
Two...

5113
03:05:42,310 --> 03:05:42,950
Oh!

5114
03:05:43,050 --> 03:05:43,530
Kicked out!

5115
03:05:43,630 --> 03:05:44,290
How did you survive?

5116
03:05:45,090 --> 03:05:46,230
Still has a fighting chance.

5117
03:05:47,530 --> 03:05:48,850
After all that, Shinri...

5118
03:05:49,070 --> 03:05:50,130
He's still fighting back.

5119
03:05:51,150 --> 03:05:52,790
He's resilient like a koi.

5120
03:05:53,850 --> 03:05:55,430
Like a koi coming upstream.

5121
03:05:56,030 --> 03:05:56,850
Like a koi coming upstream.

5122
03:05:57,950 --> 03:05:58,430
Oh!

5123
03:05:58,650 --> 03:05:58,950
Ah!

5124
03:06:00,350 --> 03:06:01,790
I think that's it.

5125
03:06:02,050 --> 03:06:03,230
I think that's it.

5126
03:06:03,350 --> 03:06:04,150
The pin is here.

5127
03:06:04,350 --> 03:06:05,050
Oh wait!

5128
03:06:05,890 --> 03:06:06,370
Reversal!

5129
03:06:06,690 --> 03:06:07,610
Kicked in the butt!

5130
03:06:08,750 --> 03:06:09,790
Reversal after reversal.

5131
03:06:12,170 --> 03:06:12,650
Finisher!

5132
03:06:12,910 --> 03:06:13,590
This is it!

5133
03:06:13,810 --> 03:06:14,090
It's Jover.

5134
03:06:14,910 --> 03:06:15,930
It's so over!

5135
03:06:16,530 --> 03:06:17,910
Dragging Shinri to the middle.

5136
03:06:17,970 --> 03:06:19,050
Dragging the body so it won't get over.

5137
03:06:19,930 --> 03:06:20,550
Yeah!

5138
03:06:20,690 --> 03:06:21,010
Kicked out!

5139
03:06:21,090 --> 03:06:21,350
Let's go!

5140
03:06:21,730 --> 03:06:22,350
One!

5141
03:06:22,670 --> 03:06:23,290
Two!

5142
03:06:23,450 --> 03:06:24,350
Slap in the face!

5143
03:06:24,390 --> 03:06:24,690
Three!

5144
03:06:24,990 --> 03:06:26,390
And Bulk Bogan survived!

5145
03:06:26,800 --> 03:06:27,350
And Bulk Bogan survived!

5146
03:06:29,950 --> 03:06:31,750
And Bulk Bogan...

5147
03:06:31,750 --> 03:06:33,140
Here is your winner!

5148
03:06:34,230 --> 03:06:34,890
Here is your winner!

5149
03:06:35,030 --> 03:06:37,250
Representing Nagorai Sora...

5150
03:06:37,250 --> 03:06:37,350
Representing Nagorai Sora...

5151
03:06:39,530 --> 03:06:40,770
BULK BOOGAN!

5152
03:06:42,730 --> 03:06:44,510
It's truly Koi-ver.

5153
03:06:44,950 --> 03:06:46,230
For the koi.

5154
03:06:46,230 --> 03:06:48,050
This is Spack-Everest!

5155
03:06:48,230 --> 03:06:48,590
Oh!

5156
03:06:49,010 --> 03:06:49,710
What the fuck!

5157
03:06:49,790 --> 03:06:50,330
What the fuck!

5158
03:06:50,350 --> 03:06:50,810
Security!

5159
03:06:53,270 --> 03:06:55,210
Don't do that!

5160
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:57,450
We're not a National Geographic!

5161
03:06:57,690 --> 03:06:58,230
Look at my snake!

5162
03:06:58,350 --> 03:07:01,790
Let me whip it out for the camera.

5163
03:07:01,990 --> 03:07:02,530
What's this?

5164
03:07:03,010 --> 03:07:05,510
I tempted Adam in the Garden of Eden.

5165
03:07:08,290 --> 03:07:09,430
What the hell was that?

5166
03:07:09,510 --> 03:07:10,650
What the fuck was the snake for?

5167
03:07:11,270 --> 03:07:12,730
That was totally irrelevant.

5168
03:07:12,730 --> 03:07:13,990
But thank you though.

5169
03:07:14,490 --> 03:07:16,170
Thank you for showing up for Snake!

5170
03:07:16,770 --> 03:07:17,530
Thank you!

5171
03:07:17,610 --> 03:07:19,070
And we have a winner!

5172
03:07:19,550 --> 03:07:20,070
Sara!

5173
03:07:23,050 --> 03:07:24,590
That was a long...

5174
03:07:24,590 --> 03:07:26,450
That was a great long match!

5175
03:07:26,470 --> 03:07:26,950
Jesus!

5176
03:07:27,310 --> 03:07:28,690
What can I say?

5177
03:07:28,690 --> 03:07:29,670
I was like, it's a landing.

5178
03:07:31,290 --> 03:07:32,610
You did so well!

5179
03:07:32,830 --> 03:07:34,550
I can't believe you kept your word though.

5180
03:07:34,650 --> 03:07:35,190
You really...

5181
03:07:35,190 --> 03:07:38,530
It was like a slow start from when you were entering the ring.

5182
03:07:38,670 --> 03:07:40,510
But other than that, you really pinned him down.

5183
03:07:41,330 --> 03:07:42,590
Yeah, that's what we...

5184
03:07:42,730 --> 03:07:44,150
That's what the biz likes to call, you know?

5185
03:07:44,490 --> 03:07:46,150
Just giving the people a show.

5186
03:07:46,350 --> 03:07:47,370
Like, I let them think.

5187
03:07:47,490 --> 03:07:51,170
I let Shinri and his fans think that he could take me on.

5188
03:07:51,310 --> 03:07:54,350
But, just, you know, as I said, stuck the landing.

5189
03:07:54,790 --> 03:07:56,250
Stuck the landing and killed him.

5190
03:07:56,390 --> 03:07:57,350
Yeah, very good.

5191
03:07:58,230 --> 03:08:00,470
I'm playing did prevail over the koi.

5192
03:08:00,750 --> 03:08:01,570
Can't believe it.

5193
03:08:03,410 --> 03:08:04,550
I'm so upset.

5194
03:08:04,790 --> 03:08:05,390
I'm so upset.

5195
03:08:07,150 --> 03:08:07,890
I'm just...

5196
03:08:07,890 --> 03:08:09,530
I'm sure you are real Shinri.

5197
03:08:09,630 --> 03:08:10,150
I'm sure you are.

5198
03:08:10,210 --> 03:08:11,010
No, Shinri, we got you.

5199
03:08:11,110 --> 03:08:11,510
We got you.

5200
03:08:11,550 --> 03:08:11,990
We got you.

5201
03:08:12,050 --> 03:08:12,350
Don't worry.

5202
03:08:12,730 --> 03:08:13,210
I'm Shinri.

5203
03:08:14,590 --> 03:08:15,890
Yeah, you are.

5204
03:08:15,950 --> 03:08:16,470
Yeah, you are.

5205
03:08:16,490 --> 03:08:17,070
What the fuck?

5206
03:08:17,890 --> 03:08:19,250
Yeah, you are.

5207
03:08:19,290 --> 03:08:20,710
You are definitely Shinri.

5208
03:08:21,290 --> 03:08:22,550
I think he has a concussion.

5209
03:08:23,350 --> 03:08:24,590
There's one thing we can all agree on.

5210
03:08:24,770 --> 03:08:26,150
We can comfort each other, bro.

5211
03:08:26,770 --> 03:08:27,410
Okay, okay.

5212
03:08:27,550 --> 03:08:27,970
I love you.

5213
03:08:28,410 --> 03:08:29,290
I love you too, bro.

5214
03:08:29,730 --> 03:08:30,370
Oh, wait.

5215
03:08:30,430 --> 03:08:30,730
No, no.

5216
03:08:30,730 --> 03:08:31,370
Not time for that.

5217
03:08:31,450 --> 03:08:31,730
No, no.

5218
03:08:32,150 --> 03:08:32,830
Thank you, though.

5219
03:08:34,930 --> 03:08:35,710
Love you too.

5220
03:08:36,810 --> 03:08:37,570
I love you too.

5221
03:08:37,570 --> 03:08:37,950
No, not you.

5222
03:08:38,170 --> 03:08:39,150
I love you too, Sara.

5223
03:08:39,150 --> 03:08:40,410
I love you too.

5224
03:08:41,510 --> 03:08:42,970
Do you want to grab coffee?

5225
03:08:43,030 --> 03:08:43,230
Oh, wait.

5226
03:08:43,290 --> 03:08:43,550
What is it?

5227
03:08:43,630 --> 03:08:43,730
Oh.

5228
03:08:45,190 --> 03:08:45,650
It's mine.

5229
03:08:46,050 --> 03:08:46,430
Oh, wait.

5230
03:08:46,910 --> 03:08:47,370
I'll pay.

5231
03:08:47,470 --> 03:08:47,610
I'll pay.

5232
03:08:47,850 --> 03:08:51,850
Because, you know, I'm just so ripped and filled with cash.

5233
03:08:52,010 --> 03:08:52,230
Yeah.

5234
03:08:53,110 --> 03:08:53,450
Wow.

5235
03:08:53,450 --> 03:08:53,790
Yeah.

5236
03:08:54,030 --> 03:08:54,530
For you.

5237
03:08:54,650 --> 03:08:56,070
Can you please order for me?

5238
03:08:56,350 --> 03:08:56,690
No.

5239
03:08:57,110 --> 03:08:57,830
Are you a woman?

5240
03:09:01,290 --> 03:09:01,630
Ouch.

5241
03:09:04,410 --> 03:09:06,750
I just wanted a coffee with milk.

5242
03:09:08,530 --> 03:09:09,330
Well, I...

5243
03:09:09,330 --> 03:09:10,750
You guys did amazing, Sara.

5244
03:09:10,850 --> 03:09:12,190
Congratulations for winning.

5245
03:09:12,370 --> 03:09:12,710
Thank you.

5246
03:09:12,810 --> 03:09:13,590
Oh, my goodness.

5247
03:09:13,650 --> 03:09:14,050
Yeah.

5248
03:09:14,050 --> 03:09:14,050
Thank you.

5249
03:09:14,050 --> 03:09:14,350
Thank you.

5250
03:09:14,350 --> 03:09:14,930
Thank you.

5251
03:09:15,290 --> 03:09:15,690
Congratulations.

5252
03:09:16,270 --> 03:09:16,450
Yeah.

5253
03:09:16,950 --> 03:09:19,150
That was very, very interesting.

5254
03:09:19,910 --> 03:09:20,310
What a great fight.

5255
03:09:20,310 --> 03:09:20,330
Yeah.

5256
03:09:20,450 --> 03:09:20,710
Yeah.

5257
03:09:20,870 --> 03:09:21,270
Yeah.

5258
03:09:21,270 --> 03:09:21,710
Very close.

5259
03:09:23,030 --> 03:09:23,430
Yeah.

5260
03:09:23,430 --> 03:09:26,490
So, please keep your snake in its... I don't know...

5261
03:09:26,490 --> 03:09:26,790
Yeah.

5262
03:09:26,830 --> 03:09:27,750
Where did you get that snake?

5263
03:09:28,070 --> 03:09:28,070
Jar cage.

5264
03:09:28,370 --> 03:09:28,770
Yeah.

5265
03:09:28,790 --> 03:09:29,770
That was like totally irrelevant.

5266
03:09:29,790 --> 03:09:30,670
That came out of nowhere.

5267
03:09:32,730 --> 03:09:34,570
Like, I thought you weren't going to throw it in the scenery.

5268
03:09:34,770 --> 03:09:35,230
It didn't.

5269
03:09:37,150 --> 03:09:38,110
Like, look at this.

5270
03:09:38,210 --> 03:09:39,270
I got a snake with me.

5271
03:09:39,350 --> 03:09:40,030
What the fuck?

5272
03:09:42,290 --> 03:09:45,030
But was it not epic and memorable at least?

5273
03:09:45,150 --> 03:09:45,610
It was so... Okay.

5274
03:09:45,850 --> 03:09:47,670
Dude, your intro was fucking long too.

5275
03:09:48,550 --> 03:09:49,830
Snake on a plane.

5276
03:09:50,610 --> 03:09:51,930
Oh, snake on a plane reference.

5277
03:09:52,210 --> 03:09:52,650
Oh.

5278
03:09:54,590 --> 03:09:55,030
Wow.

5279
03:09:56,410 --> 03:09:56,850
Wow.

5280
03:09:56,850 --> 03:09:57,490
Just wow.

5281
03:09:57,690 --> 03:09:57,990
That's crazy.

5282
03:09:58,330 --> 03:09:58,770
Crazy.

5283
03:09:59,150 --> 03:09:59,590
Wow.

5284
03:10:01,430 --> 03:10:01,870
Insane.

5285
03:10:02,950 --> 03:10:03,390
Yeah.

5286
03:10:03,390 --> 03:10:07,230
But thank you guys so much for participating in the WWE tournament.

5287
03:10:07,470 --> 03:10:08,230
Thank you, Shinry.

5288
03:10:08,330 --> 03:10:11,690
You tried your best, but you know, you miss 100% shots you don't take.

5289
03:10:11,770 --> 03:10:12,030
So, yeah.

5290
03:10:12,110 --> 03:10:12,730
Thank you.

5291
03:10:12,730 --> 03:10:13,110
Thank you.

5292
03:10:13,130 --> 03:10:13,710
Thank you.

5293
03:10:14,030 --> 03:10:15,850
Glad to have you here even though you're sick.

5294
03:10:15,990 --> 03:10:16,390
Thank you.

5295
03:10:16,470 --> 03:10:17,050
Oh, yeah.

5296
03:10:17,110 --> 03:10:17,250
Yeah.

5297
03:10:17,290 --> 03:10:17,610
Thanks.

5298
03:10:17,670 --> 03:10:18,310
Thanks for having me.

5299
03:10:19,490 --> 03:10:20,630
I'm Chasuchi Shinry.

5300
03:10:20,770 --> 03:10:21,830
I think I should go.

5301
03:10:22,370 --> 03:10:22,770
Yeah.

5302
03:10:22,790 --> 03:10:23,110
Go rest.

5303
03:10:23,290 --> 03:10:23,870
Thank you.

5304
03:10:24,430 --> 03:10:25,150
Go rest.

5305
03:10:25,150 --> 03:10:25,510
You're sick.

5306
03:10:26,170 --> 03:10:27,430
Sarah, congratulations.

5307
03:10:27,930 --> 03:10:28,590
That was great.

5308
03:10:29,270 --> 03:10:29,670
Yeah.

5309
03:10:29,670 --> 03:10:29,990
All right.

5310
03:10:30,070 --> 03:10:31,230
See you later in your next match.

5311
03:10:32,410 --> 03:10:33,210
Congratulations, Sarah.

5312
03:10:33,670 --> 03:10:35,330
You're going to proceed to the finals.

5313
03:10:35,690 --> 03:10:36,250
So, yeah.

5314
03:10:36,490 --> 03:10:38,370
Better wait on the second day, everybody.

5315
03:10:39,230 --> 03:10:40,070
Let's fucking go.

5316
03:10:42,270 --> 03:10:43,230
He didn't hear it.

5317
03:10:43,250 --> 03:10:43,850
He didn't hear it.

5318
03:10:44,110 --> 03:10:44,470
Wait.

5319
03:10:44,550 --> 03:10:44,710
What?

5320
03:10:44,810 --> 03:10:45,190
What did I...

5321
03:10:46,670 --> 03:10:48,150
You talked... I talked over you.

5322
03:10:48,170 --> 03:10:48,870
What did you say?

5323
03:10:50,590 --> 03:10:50,950
Nothing.

5324
03:10:50,950 --> 03:10:51,130
Wait.

5325
03:10:51,130 --> 03:10:51,470
What did you say?

5326
03:10:51,630 --> 03:10:53,950
I was just dunking on you as per usual.

5327
03:10:54,330 --> 03:10:55,010
Oh, come on.

5328
03:10:55,050 --> 03:10:55,210
Okay.

5329
03:10:55,250 --> 03:10:56,130
Let's just go back to the...

5330
03:10:56,130 --> 03:10:57,370
I don't need... I don't want to explain it.

5331
03:10:59,490 --> 03:10:59,850
Okay.

5332
03:11:00,390 --> 03:11:00,910
Next match.

5333
03:11:00,910 --> 03:11:01,750
Stop dunking on me.

5334
03:11:01,750 --> 03:11:02,870
We're working together.

5335
03:11:04,690 --> 03:11:05,210
Ooh.

5336
03:11:06,110 --> 03:11:07,070
Here he is.

5337
03:11:07,070 --> 03:11:08,050
Behind the scenes.

5338
03:11:08,370 --> 03:11:09,530
Right, baby.

5339
03:11:09,910 --> 03:11:10,590
Yeah, that's right.

5340
03:11:10,750 --> 03:11:13,170
Axel is currently at Nando's.

5341
03:11:13,590 --> 03:11:16,190
So we are going to go with Hakka versus Lee.

5342
03:11:16,930 --> 03:11:19,430
Oh, no.

5343
03:11:19,570 --> 03:11:20,130
It's him.

5344
03:11:20,710 --> 03:11:22,110
It's Hakka, everybody.

5345
03:11:22,610 --> 03:11:23,590
That's right, everybody.

5346
03:11:23,710 --> 03:11:25,670
Bow down to your fucking new god.

5347
03:11:26,530 --> 03:11:27,290
How does...

5348
03:11:27,290 --> 03:11:28,550
Hakka, Hakka.

5349
03:11:28,570 --> 03:11:29,430
How does it feel to win?

5350
03:11:29,530 --> 03:11:30,870
Because I haven't won.

5351
03:11:31,170 --> 03:11:32,850
It feels fantastic, guys.

5352
03:11:32,870 --> 03:11:34,750
You see, I have my previous loser here.

5353
03:11:34,930 --> 03:11:36,670
And I can't wait to have my brand new loser.

5354
03:11:36,770 --> 03:11:40,570
I hope they go ahead and do a fucking backflip back to the ring so I can beat their fucking ass.

5355
03:11:40,990 --> 03:11:41,850
Oh, what the hell?

5356
03:11:42,930 --> 03:11:44,050
Madres poca puta.

5357
03:11:45,650 --> 03:11:46,010
Oh!

5358
03:11:46,010 --> 03:11:46,590
What's happening?

5359
03:11:46,650 --> 03:11:48,190
I don't understand what you just said, but oh!

5360
03:11:48,910 --> 03:11:51,090
And Phil fucking went with a twink, baby.

5361
03:11:51,210 --> 03:11:52,090
That's what I'm fucking saying.

5362
03:11:53,310 --> 03:11:53,670
Twink?

5363
03:11:53,670 --> 03:11:54,030
Twink?

5364
03:11:54,330 --> 03:11:54,950
What the fuck?

5365
03:11:56,630 --> 03:11:57,310
We're still good.

5366
03:11:58,530 --> 03:11:59,250
Oh, um...

5367
03:12:00,450 --> 03:12:01,770
Backstage, I have no idea.

5368
03:12:01,850 --> 03:12:02,450
I need to learn Jilly Jilly.

5369
03:12:02,870 --> 03:12:03,210
Oh, no, no, no.

5370
03:12:03,490 --> 03:12:06,390
Well, um...

5371
03:12:06,390 --> 03:12:09,070
Look, Fillion did say...

5372
03:12:09,070 --> 03:12:13,850
Fillion did say to let her know before the match started that her match was gonna be up.

5373
03:12:13,850 --> 03:12:14,290
Oh, there she is!

5374
03:12:14,310 --> 03:12:14,610
I see her!

5375
03:12:15,050 --> 03:12:18,210
Wait, what's happening?

5376
03:12:18,330 --> 03:12:18,810
What am I doing?

5377
03:12:19,310 --> 03:12:20,430
You're fighting Hakka.

5378
03:12:20,890 --> 03:12:23,550
Isn't that a brand new fucking loser right here?

5379
03:12:23,750 --> 03:12:25,070
I was freaking out back.

5380
03:12:25,250 --> 03:12:25,750
What the frick?

5381
03:12:27,150 --> 03:12:30,510
How about you do a fucking backflip straight to the fucking ring and beat me up, huh?

5382
03:12:30,510 --> 03:12:32,210
You off in circus, monkey?

5383
03:12:32,350 --> 03:12:33,650
How about you F'n... I don't know.

5384
03:12:34,270 --> 03:12:35,210
I don't know, man.

5385
03:12:35,330 --> 03:12:39,430
You better prepare a fucking new VTuber award for the person who's gonna fucking beat your fucking ass in the ring, baby.

5386
03:12:39,530 --> 03:12:39,790
Come here.

5387
03:12:39,930 --> 03:12:43,150
You're gonna win the F'n award for most curse words said in five minutes.

5388
03:12:44,770 --> 03:12:46,470
Why is it so much like...

5389
03:12:46,470 --> 03:12:47,890
Name ten words.

5390
03:12:48,150 --> 03:12:48,870
Name ten words.

5391
03:12:50,330 --> 03:12:51,310
I'm fucking pumped!

5392
03:12:51,610 --> 03:12:52,330
I fucking won!

5393
03:12:52,330 --> 03:12:52,590
Name ten words.

5394
03:12:53,250 --> 03:12:53,890
I'm winning!

5395
03:12:54,550 --> 03:12:56,930
Are you confident that you're gonna win again against Fillion?

5396
03:12:57,110 --> 03:12:57,250
Absolutely.

5397
03:12:57,590 --> 03:12:59,730
They called me the crow because I'm about to pick those fucking eyes.

5398
03:13:00,670 --> 03:13:01,070
What?

5399
03:13:03,570 --> 03:13:04,710
Bro, this is fucking pumped.

5400
03:13:04,750 --> 03:13:04,770
What's this fucking response?

5401
03:13:07,470 --> 03:13:08,950
This dude just is one.

5402
03:13:09,070 --> 03:13:10,870
Like, I don't even know what I'm dealing with right now.

5403
03:13:12,050 --> 03:13:13,750
No one does.

5404
03:13:13,910 --> 03:13:14,450
Let me tell you.

5405
03:13:14,490 --> 03:13:15,450
My mom fucking checked me.

5406
03:13:15,490 --> 03:13:16,710
They don't know what's fucking wrong with me.

5407
03:13:16,750 --> 03:13:18,250
But you're gonna figure that fucking out tonight.

5408
03:13:18,690 --> 03:13:20,190
Bro, she literally called you weird.

5409
03:13:20,290 --> 03:13:21,130
Jesus Christ.

5410
03:13:21,350 --> 03:13:21,750
Fuck you over.

5411
03:13:22,790 --> 03:13:23,490
You're done for.

5412
03:13:25,550 --> 03:13:25,950
Okay.

5413
03:13:26,210 --> 03:13:26,750
That's cool.

5414
03:13:26,830 --> 03:13:27,290
That's cool.

5415
03:13:28,350 --> 03:13:29,050
Whatever you want, man.

5416
03:13:29,150 --> 03:13:30,190
Or maybe like, I don't know.

5417
03:13:30,350 --> 03:13:31,290
Like, rock, paper, scissors.

5418
03:13:32,070 --> 03:13:32,770
Yeah, yeah, sure.

5419
03:13:32,970 --> 03:13:33,410
You know.

5420
03:13:33,530 --> 03:13:34,030
Let's see.

5421
03:13:34,130 --> 03:13:34,510
Let's see.

5422
03:13:34,890 --> 03:13:35,290
Well...

5423
03:13:35,290 --> 03:13:38,190
How do you even...

5424
03:13:38,190 --> 03:13:39,890
I've been a bingo more!

5425
03:13:40,090 --> 03:13:42,130
Just say one of the three options.

5426
03:13:42,530 --> 03:13:44,730
I need a translator for how to sing.

5427
03:13:44,750 --> 03:13:45,530
We do rock, paper, scissors.

5428
03:13:46,250 --> 03:13:47,890
Loser gets a finger cut off before we start.

5429
03:13:47,890 --> 03:13:49,030
Chat, bring out Google Translate.

5430
03:13:50,370 --> 03:13:51,750
Can Google translate?

5431
03:13:52,370 --> 03:13:53,190
He's speaking English.

5432
03:13:53,710 --> 03:13:54,750
I'm speaking English.

5433
03:13:55,170 --> 03:13:56,050
Just in case.

5434
03:13:56,310 --> 03:13:57,270
Just in case.

5435
03:13:58,350 --> 03:13:58,830
Just in case.

5436
03:13:59,030 --> 03:14:00,250
We need DeepL.

5437
03:14:01,150 --> 03:14:01,610
DeepL for Haka.

5438
03:14:02,110 --> 03:14:02,930
DeepL for Haka.

5439
03:14:04,930 --> 03:14:05,330
Well...

5440
03:14:07,330 --> 03:14:08,510
Well, what's happening now?

5441
03:14:09,010 --> 03:14:10,010
I might be a...

5442
03:14:10,010 --> 03:14:10,990
I might be a...

5443
03:14:10,990 --> 03:14:12,470
I might be a...

5444
03:14:13,250 --> 03:14:14,830
I might be a wild animal.

5445
03:14:14,970 --> 03:14:17,790
I might be a wild animal, but Phileon, you know what?

5446
03:14:17,830 --> 03:14:19,170
Let's have a fair fight.

5447
03:14:19,350 --> 03:14:20,490
I handshake you.

5448
03:14:20,850 --> 03:14:21,850
I handshake you.

5449
03:14:21,850 --> 03:14:23,510
Play by the rules of fucking nature.

5450
03:14:23,850 --> 03:14:26,630
And just prefer that a war for me, because I'm gonna beat your fucking ass.

5451
03:14:27,310 --> 03:14:27,790
Oh...

5452
03:14:27,790 --> 03:14:28,030
Okay.

5453
03:14:28,570 --> 03:14:29,050
Yeah.

5454
03:14:31,550 --> 03:14:33,330
Who do you guys think will win?

5455
03:14:33,550 --> 03:14:36,610
Haka or Phileon?

5456
03:14:37,350 --> 03:14:38,470
Come on, man.

5457
03:14:38,490 --> 03:14:38,750
Win.

5458
03:14:39,510 --> 03:14:41,850
Armus and all the stars.

5459
03:14:42,410 --> 03:14:43,650
We're rooting for you, buddy.

5460
03:14:44,210 --> 03:14:47,010
Wait, if I won this, nerd, do I get to cast myself?

5461
03:14:48,090 --> 03:14:48,570
No.

5462
03:14:49,030 --> 03:14:49,510
Yeah.

5463
03:14:49,710 --> 03:14:51,030
But I cast her, right?

5464
03:14:52,430 --> 03:14:52,910
What?

5465
03:14:52,910 --> 03:14:57,110
If you win this fight, Phileon, you get to cast yourself later in the next game.

5466
03:14:57,430 --> 03:14:57,730
Let's go!

5467
03:14:58,010 --> 03:14:59,030
Hey, let's go!

5468
03:15:00,370 --> 03:15:03,030
You have to win it, though.

5469
03:15:03,190 --> 03:15:04,170
You have to.

5470
03:15:05,310 --> 03:15:07,290
Why is it for Toronto, Canada?

5471
03:15:07,650 --> 03:15:08,910
I'm not... what the fuck?

5472
03:15:10,010 --> 03:15:10,470
Wait.

5473
03:15:11,110 --> 03:15:12,090
Toronto, Canada?

5474
03:15:12,950 --> 03:15:14,550
Hey, you're not supposed to be here.

5475
03:15:14,630 --> 03:15:15,090
Get in the ring.

5476
03:15:20,990 --> 03:15:21,510
And...

5477
03:15:21,510 --> 03:15:24,110
The following contest is...

5478
03:15:24,470 --> 03:15:25,730
The final schedule for OneFall.

5479
03:15:26,390 --> 03:15:33,030
Introducing first, TwinkleTwinkle, his conquest unmarred, WakaWaka, Itaka!

5480
03:15:35,430 --> 03:15:36,570
Oh, man.

5481
03:15:36,670 --> 03:15:37,690
I love your intros, bro.

5482
03:15:37,850 --> 03:15:38,590
Thank you.

5483
03:15:38,670 --> 03:15:39,190
Thank you for that.

5484
03:15:39,350 --> 03:15:40,270
Shakira Shakira!

5485
03:15:40,830 --> 03:15:41,910
Shakira Shakira!

5486
03:15:42,550 --> 03:15:49,990
Introducing his opponent, Phileon Like A Killian, one in a billion!

5487
03:15:50,810 --> 03:15:53,230
If you blink, you'll miss him!

5488
03:15:53,230 --> 03:15:54,450
It's Phileon!

5489
03:15:55,090 --> 03:15:55,570
Killian!

5490
03:15:57,670 --> 03:15:58,690
Let's fucking go!

5491
03:15:59,690 --> 03:16:00,270
Let's go!

5492
03:16:00,870 --> 03:16:01,770
Killian Murphy!

5493
03:16:02,470 --> 03:16:06,750
Another one of that breakdancing show that was presented earlier.

5494
03:16:07,010 --> 03:16:07,590
My goodness.

5495
03:16:08,450 --> 03:16:09,730
They're still catching up.

5496
03:16:10,470 --> 03:16:16,510
But yeah, I'm hoping for the best for Haka, considering that he is part of our Hall of Stars branch.

5497
03:16:16,690 --> 03:16:18,010
So I hope you win.

5498
03:16:18,150 --> 03:16:19,970
No bias, but I hope you win.

5499
03:16:20,110 --> 03:16:20,910
Good luck, Haka!

5500
03:16:21,090 --> 03:16:21,770
Good luck!

5501
03:16:22,590 --> 03:16:23,590
I'm rooting for you.

5502
03:16:23,730 --> 03:16:24,450
We'll see how Haka changes.

5503
03:16:24,470 --> 03:16:25,050
This time!

5504
03:16:26,290 --> 03:16:30,510
Or will Phileon actually turn the tables and actually win this match?

5505
03:16:30,510 --> 03:16:31,430
I feel like Phileon will win.

5506
03:16:32,030 --> 03:16:33,090
Oh yeah, let's see.

5507
03:16:35,010 --> 03:16:35,970
Subversion of expectations.

5508
03:16:36,930 --> 03:16:41,110
Those dance moves make her like a really competitive fighter.

5509
03:16:41,910 --> 03:16:45,090
She can get out of pins, she can jump, she can high fly.

5510
03:16:45,710 --> 03:16:49,750
Yeah, like the previous match that we watched with her was like nothing but high flying.

5511
03:16:50,530 --> 03:16:52,750
I wonder what this match is gonna turn out into.

5512
03:16:52,750 --> 03:16:54,570
Like a heavy fighter?

5513
03:16:54,930 --> 03:16:55,930
Like a heavy swiker?

5514
03:16:56,050 --> 03:16:57,850
Or a lightweighter?

5515
03:17:01,900 --> 03:17:03,180
Okay, here we go!

5516
03:17:03,880 --> 03:17:04,960
Alright, alright!

5517
03:17:05,840 --> 03:17:06,960
We shall see!

5518
03:17:07,680 --> 03:17:08,120
Haka!

5519
03:17:09,740 --> 03:17:10,900
Versus Phileon!

5520
03:17:11,660 --> 03:17:12,240
Fight!

5521
03:17:12,460 --> 03:17:13,100
Oh wow!

5522
03:17:13,280 --> 03:17:13,860
Whoa!

5523
03:17:14,480 --> 03:17:15,060
DDT!

5524
03:17:15,380 --> 03:17:16,960
Immediately right off the bat!

5525
03:17:17,620 --> 03:17:18,200
DDT!

5526
03:17:18,580 --> 03:17:20,580
All I'm seeing is Kaka!

5527
03:17:20,580 --> 03:17:22,940
One of these big throws, high flyer attacks.

5528
03:17:23,220 --> 03:17:23,960
Holy crap!

5529
03:17:24,400 --> 03:17:25,640
What are you doing?

5530
03:17:26,020 --> 03:17:26,520
Haka!

5531
03:17:26,660 --> 03:17:27,800
You're failing immediately!

5532
03:17:28,120 --> 03:17:28,480
To the kidney!

5533
03:17:29,100 --> 03:17:30,060
To the face!

5534
03:17:30,060 --> 03:17:30,940
Oh my god!

5535
03:17:31,080 --> 03:17:33,480
Already smudging the face into the fucking ring!

5536
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:34,860
It's so over!

5537
03:17:36,220 --> 03:17:40,420
But we just started, so let us see if this narrative continues on down the road.

5538
03:17:40,540 --> 03:17:41,260
And it hurts!

5539
03:17:41,280 --> 03:17:43,080
Those tendons and ligaments are getting torn!

5540
03:17:44,420 --> 03:17:45,880
By Phileon the Killian!

5541
03:17:46,760 --> 03:17:47,260
Ow!

5542
03:17:47,480 --> 03:17:48,620
Okay, that hurt!

5543
03:17:48,800 --> 03:17:48,960
Oh!

5544
03:17:49,140 --> 03:17:50,340
Another one to the face!

5545
03:17:50,580 --> 03:17:52,540
Haka barely even fighting back!

5546
03:17:53,060 --> 03:17:54,140
Twisting your arm!

5547
03:17:54,300 --> 03:17:55,480
Are you okay, Haka?

5548
03:17:55,840 --> 03:17:57,240
Break those fingers again!

5549
03:17:57,800 --> 03:17:59,240
Oh my god!

5550
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:01,520
Oh my god!

5551
03:18:01,660 --> 03:18:02,320
I guess...

5552
03:18:02,320 --> 03:18:04,820
I guess this is what you call like an animal fight.

5553
03:18:05,200 --> 03:18:05,960
Like a...

5554
03:18:05,960 --> 03:18:06,940
Can he reverse it?

5555
03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:08,200
No, he's gonna do it again!

5556
03:18:08,900 --> 03:18:10,020
I ran out of words.

5557
03:18:10,220 --> 03:18:10,940
Oh shit!

5558
03:18:11,580 --> 03:18:12,100
Again!

5559
03:18:12,260 --> 03:18:12,680
Again!

5560
03:18:13,100 --> 03:18:13,620
Again!

5561
03:18:13,620 --> 03:18:13,760
Again!

5562
03:18:14,700 --> 03:18:15,580
Why are you still?

5563
03:18:16,300 --> 03:18:18,040
Targeting Haka's fingies!

5564
03:18:18,460 --> 03:18:18,980
Owie!

5565
03:18:19,420 --> 03:18:19,940
Owie!

5566
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:21,860
It's over!

5567
03:18:22,220 --> 03:18:25,440
Haka won't be able to use a spoon and fork again after this fight.

5568
03:18:25,640 --> 03:18:28,380
The reversal like statistics is very high.

5569
03:18:28,700 --> 03:18:28,760
He's gonna drink the straw only.

5570
03:18:30,620 --> 03:18:31,180
Oh!

5571
03:18:31,340 --> 03:18:31,680
Ow!

5572
03:18:31,820 --> 03:18:32,820
Okay, finally a comeback!

5573
03:18:33,660 --> 03:18:35,220
An elbow to the face!

5574
03:18:35,660 --> 03:18:36,820
Sizing each other up!

5575
03:18:36,940 --> 03:18:38,900
And Phileon again with another advantage!

5576
03:18:40,100 --> 03:18:40,660
Oh!

5577
03:18:42,560 --> 03:18:44,240
Never getting back up!

5578
03:18:44,280 --> 03:18:44,640
It's gonna hurt!

5579
03:18:44,760 --> 03:18:44,880
Oh!

5580
03:18:44,880 --> 03:18:46,180
Another somersault technique!

5581
03:18:47,420 --> 03:18:47,960
Bunz!

5582
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:48,340
Owie!

5583
03:18:48,560 --> 03:18:49,100
Owie!

5584
03:18:49,400 --> 03:18:49,940
Owie!

5585
03:18:49,960 --> 03:18:50,720
A pin opportunity!

5586
03:18:51,120 --> 03:18:53,860
That could have turned the table!

5587
03:18:54,320 --> 03:18:57,560
But no, it's still early and barely any damage has been done.

5588
03:18:57,760 --> 03:18:59,580
It would be a miracle to perform.

5589
03:18:59,960 --> 03:19:01,320
Phileon just keeps tumbling and rumbling.

5590
03:19:02,540 --> 03:19:03,680
And going around.

5591
03:19:03,780 --> 03:19:04,060
Rumbling!

5592
03:19:05,460 --> 03:19:06,000
Oh!

5593
03:19:07,400 --> 03:19:07,900
Oh.

5594
03:19:09,340 --> 03:19:12,160
Okay, this might be Haka's time to come back.

5595
03:19:12,180 --> 03:19:12,600
Do a comeback.

5596
03:19:13,380 --> 03:19:15,000
On the turnbuckle.

5597
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:16,960
Salvo punches.

5598
03:19:18,420 --> 03:19:21,760
This corner may be his only chance of winning it back.

5599
03:19:21,940 --> 03:19:23,720
And no, he got punched into the gut.

5600
03:19:24,020 --> 03:19:24,540
And...

5601
03:19:24,540 --> 03:19:25,080
Oh!

5602
03:19:26,540 --> 03:19:27,060
Oh!

5603
03:19:27,300 --> 03:19:28,120
He got caught!

5604
03:19:28,420 --> 03:19:30,580
And an elbow to the chest!

5605
03:19:30,960 --> 03:19:32,080
Straight to the heart.

5606
03:19:33,740 --> 03:19:34,260
Oh!

5607
03:19:35,140 --> 03:19:36,880
Really focusing on the arms there.

5608
03:19:37,420 --> 03:19:38,540
I'm sorry, Haka.

5609
03:19:38,700 --> 03:19:39,220
It's over.

5610
03:19:40,100 --> 03:19:42,580
I think this is probably impossible for you to come back.

5611
03:19:42,600 --> 03:19:45,320
Unless you pull something through.

5612
03:19:46,400 --> 03:19:46,980
Okay.

5613
03:19:47,080 --> 03:19:48,460
Is this a glimmer of hope?

5614
03:19:48,560 --> 03:19:49,560
A glimmer of hope!

5615
03:19:51,740 --> 03:19:54,560
Is this the light at a very dark tunnel?

5616
03:19:54,960 --> 03:19:55,540
Is this the light at a very dark tunnel?

5617
03:19:56,370 --> 03:19:56,800
Oh wait!

5618
03:19:58,240 --> 03:19:59,180
Is this it?

5619
03:19:59,580 --> 03:19:59,760
Oh!

5620
03:20:00,580 --> 03:20:01,160
Oh!

5621
03:20:01,460 --> 03:20:02,600
Got back up!

5622
03:20:02,820 --> 03:20:03,000
Oh!

5623
03:20:03,080 --> 03:20:03,980
It wasn't enough!

5624
03:20:04,040 --> 03:20:06,840
Oh shit!

5625
03:20:08,580 --> 03:20:09,320
Here's a pin!

5626
03:20:10,220 --> 03:20:11,280
Come on referee!

5627
03:20:11,560 --> 03:20:12,200
You're so slow!

5628
03:20:12,600 --> 03:20:13,380
Oh, nothing, nothing.

5629
03:20:13,460 --> 03:20:13,980
A kick out.

5630
03:20:14,080 --> 03:20:15,060
Kick out of the pin.

5631
03:20:15,100 --> 03:20:17,440
And surprisingly, it didn't have a count.

5632
03:20:18,920 --> 03:20:20,440
Surprisingly resilient of Haka.

5633
03:20:24,460 --> 03:20:25,480
Billion throwing him.

5634
03:20:25,800 --> 03:20:26,880
Haka throwing back.

5635
03:20:27,620 --> 03:20:28,080
Somersaulting!

5636
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:28,840
What is going on in Haka?

5637
03:20:29,080 --> 03:20:29,980
Are you okay?

5638
03:20:30,180 --> 03:20:30,300
Oh!

5639
03:20:30,300 --> 03:20:30,960
Moon kick!

5640
03:20:31,300 --> 03:20:31,460
Oh!

5641
03:20:34,400 --> 03:20:35,520
Haka was funny there.

5642
03:20:35,580 --> 03:20:35,880
He was like...

5643
03:20:35,880 --> 03:20:36,300
Right.

5644
03:20:36,300 --> 03:20:36,380
Right.

5645
03:20:40,620 --> 03:20:41,100
Oh!

5646
03:20:41,320 --> 03:20:41,660
Oh!

5647
03:20:41,740 --> 03:20:42,640
This might be it.

5648
03:20:43,160 --> 03:20:44,100
Yeah, this is it.

5649
03:20:44,140 --> 03:20:45,800
That wasn't even a match.

5650
03:20:45,900 --> 03:20:47,480
That was like a fucking massacre.

5651
03:20:47,820 --> 03:20:48,100
Oh!

5652
03:20:48,580 --> 03:20:49,340
Still going!

5653
03:20:49,420 --> 03:20:50,140
This referee is so slow!

5654
03:20:50,540 --> 03:20:51,020
What?

5655
03:20:51,780 --> 03:20:53,000
Somebody fire the referee!

5656
03:20:53,760 --> 03:20:54,200
Haka!

5657
03:20:54,200 --> 03:20:54,200
Haka!

5658
03:20:54,440 --> 03:20:56,860
I gotta admit, you're pretty fucking strong here.

5659
03:20:57,100 --> 03:21:00,960
Like your durability on your character is just super fucking weird.

5660
03:21:01,220 --> 03:21:02,820
What is your statistics, man?

5661
03:21:03,440 --> 03:21:04,120
And jump in!

5662
03:21:04,120 --> 03:21:04,800
I think it's the flip flops.

5663
03:21:05,640 --> 03:21:07,200
It's the flip flops.

5664
03:21:07,740 --> 03:21:08,180
Oh!

5665
03:21:08,720 --> 03:21:09,160
Countered!

5666
03:21:09,160 --> 03:21:09,300
Oh!

5667
03:21:10,560 --> 03:21:14,420
That flip only caused you like a damage to the chest.

5668
03:21:14,560 --> 03:21:15,680
Because his toes are free.

5669
03:21:16,760 --> 03:21:17,200
Oh!

5670
03:21:18,540 --> 03:21:19,700
Stun meter going up!

5671
03:21:20,360 --> 03:21:21,940
Now get her into the ring and pin her down!

5672
03:21:21,940 --> 03:21:23,040
Is he gonna get the momentum ready?

5673
03:21:23,300 --> 03:21:24,420
Three seconds outside!

5674
03:21:24,940 --> 03:21:25,160
Oh!

5675
03:21:26,840 --> 03:21:27,280
Taunting!

5676
03:21:27,400 --> 03:21:27,780
Taunting!

5677
03:21:28,060 --> 03:21:28,300
Oh!

5678
03:21:29,840 --> 03:21:31,060
Right in front of the top!

5679
03:21:31,060 --> 03:21:31,480
That's what happened!

5680
03:21:31,840 --> 03:21:32,980
The disrespect is real!

5681
03:21:33,120 --> 03:21:33,800
Oh my god!

5682
03:21:34,120 --> 03:21:34,640
Leverage pin!

5683
03:21:34,800 --> 03:21:35,260
Leverage!

5684
03:21:35,440 --> 03:21:35,920
Oh!

5685
03:21:38,380 --> 03:21:40,080
These pins are very short.

5686
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:42,220
Not even a one count.

5687
03:21:43,180 --> 03:21:43,700
Oh!

5688
03:21:43,880 --> 03:21:44,240
Ah!

5689
03:21:44,980 --> 03:21:45,500
Reversal!

5690
03:21:45,760 --> 03:21:47,240
Elbow to the face yet again.

5691
03:21:48,840 --> 03:21:49,360
Backshot!

5692
03:21:51,100 --> 03:21:51,820
Stop it!

5693
03:21:55,300 --> 03:21:55,820
Oh!

5694
03:21:57,460 --> 03:21:59,200
We're having corner attacks here.

5695
03:21:59,380 --> 03:21:59,880
One more?

5696
03:21:59,960 --> 03:22:00,740
Turnbuckle attacks.

5697
03:22:01,020 --> 03:22:01,220
Oh!

5698
03:22:01,220 --> 03:22:02,000
There's one more!

5699
03:22:02,100 --> 03:22:02,540
One more?

5700
03:22:03,040 --> 03:22:03,560
Wow!

5701
03:22:04,120 --> 03:22:04,880
Another finishing strike!

5702
03:22:05,180 --> 03:22:06,400
And here it is!

5703
03:22:06,540 --> 03:22:06,980
Pin!

5704
03:22:07,200 --> 03:22:08,080
Down for the count!

5705
03:22:08,300 --> 03:22:09,680
Is he really down for the count?

5706
03:22:09,760 --> 03:22:10,580
This might be it!

5707
03:22:10,680 --> 03:22:10,800
One!

5708
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:11,460
Two!

5709
03:22:12,160 --> 03:22:12,680
Three!

5710
03:22:14,440 --> 03:22:15,140
Billion one!

5711
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:17,320
Wow!

5712
03:22:17,460 --> 03:22:19,380
That was a one sided match!

5713
03:22:19,820 --> 03:22:21,820
Here is your winner!

5714
03:22:22,940 --> 03:22:23,980
Jedi Stunner!

5715
03:22:24,020 --> 03:22:25,960
She makes her hearts flutter!

5716
03:22:26,020 --> 03:22:28,000
What a billion billion!

5717
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:28,820
Billion!

5718
03:22:32,480 --> 03:22:32,920
Damn!

5719
03:22:33,260 --> 03:22:33,700
Congratulations!

5720
03:22:33,800 --> 03:22:34,820
Is she a fox or is she a cat?

5721
03:22:35,040 --> 03:22:35,800
Or is she a dog?

5722
03:22:37,340 --> 03:22:38,180
I don't know.

5723
03:22:39,200 --> 03:22:39,920
But yeah.

5724
03:22:40,320 --> 03:22:41,220
That animal...

5725
03:22:41,220 --> 03:22:44,200
That animal right there...

5726
03:22:44,200 --> 03:22:45,700
Is that fucking dog.

5727
03:22:45,840 --> 03:22:47,040
They got that dog in her though.

5728
03:22:47,080 --> 03:22:47,780
What's that little dot on her nose?

5729
03:22:51,520 --> 03:22:52,920
She's got that dog in her.

5730
03:22:53,440 --> 03:22:54,320
Let's fucking go.

5731
03:22:54,320 --> 03:22:55,260
She fucking won.

5732
03:22:55,260 --> 03:22:55,940
Very good match rating.

5733
03:22:57,280 --> 03:22:59,120
So what do you say Hawkeye?

5734
03:22:59,140 --> 03:23:01,460
That shit was fucking rigged!

5735
03:23:01,460 --> 03:23:02,280
Let me tell you dude.

5736
03:23:02,440 --> 03:23:04,740
The way fucking Spillion threw at me.

5737
03:23:04,900 --> 03:23:07,480
With like fucking triple backshot loss of nature.

5738
03:23:07,540 --> 03:23:08,520
With the triple bell buckle.

5739
03:23:08,600 --> 03:23:09,660
That was not fair.

5740
03:23:09,820 --> 03:23:10,840
That was an illegal move.

5741
03:23:11,940 --> 03:23:14,340
I mean that's not the only illegal thing that's been...

5742
03:23:15,480 --> 03:23:15,960
Well...

5743
03:23:15,960 --> 03:23:17,560
I'm just saying...

5744
03:23:17,560 --> 03:23:19,420
How does it feel like losing?

5745
03:23:19,760 --> 03:23:21,760
Even though you shit talked her so much.

5746
03:23:22,300 --> 03:23:23,380
Well you see...

5747
03:23:24,320 --> 03:23:26,740
I put the energy on shit talking on the actual fight.

5748
03:23:26,900 --> 03:23:28,400
It seems like I was a little bit...

5749
03:23:29,460 --> 03:23:30,340
Not balanced.

5750
03:23:30,500 --> 03:23:31,460
You know what I'm talking about?

5751
03:23:31,600 --> 03:23:33,240
The stats didn't help me out here.

5752
03:23:33,640 --> 03:23:34,600
But come on.

5753
03:23:34,600 --> 03:23:35,360
Look at Spillion man.

5754
03:23:35,620 --> 03:23:37,080
You got brutalized bro.

5755
03:23:37,460 --> 03:23:39,040
I was really impressed by your combo.

5756
03:23:39,560 --> 03:23:41,380
You hit me once and you taunted.

5757
03:23:41,540 --> 03:23:42,420
That was really good.

5758
03:23:43,960 --> 03:23:46,340
But this shit doesn't work like this over here man.

5759
03:23:46,360 --> 03:23:46,980
He keeps talking.

5760
03:23:48,220 --> 03:23:49,580
He's not cock cock cock.

5761
03:23:49,660 --> 03:23:50,800
He's fucking yap yap yap.

5762
03:23:51,320 --> 03:23:52,500
Stop yapping bro.

5763
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:53,380
You fucking lost.

5764
03:23:55,040 --> 03:23:56,380
He's still going.

5765
03:23:56,780 --> 03:23:59,360
I'm glad you think Paco is a role model.

5766
03:23:59,500 --> 03:24:00,700
Listen to me for a second.

5767
03:24:00,800 --> 03:24:01,680
Get out of my head.

5768
03:24:01,720 --> 03:24:02,960
I cannot think no more.

5769
03:24:03,140 --> 03:24:04,500
I cannot think no more man.

5770
03:24:04,620 --> 03:24:05,620
I mean you're on her head.

5771
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:06,780
She's not in your head.

5772
03:24:07,020 --> 03:24:08,120
Get out of my head.

5773
03:24:08,160 --> 03:24:09,600
I cannot think no more.

5774
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:11,720
Listen here's the...

5775
03:24:11,720 --> 03:24:14,880
They put me against a kid the first time.

5776
03:24:14,980 --> 03:24:15,960
I didn't know they'd do it again.

5777
03:24:17,260 --> 03:24:18,360
Like... I'm sorry.

5778
03:24:18,540 --> 03:24:19,640
I matched this man.

5779
03:24:19,680 --> 03:24:21,360
Damn the child allegations.

5780
03:24:21,840 --> 03:24:22,300
Oh wait no.

5781
03:24:22,500 --> 03:24:23,320
The child... wait no.

5782
03:24:23,400 --> 03:24:23,860
You know what?

5783
03:24:24,320 --> 03:24:24,720
What?

5784
03:24:24,720 --> 03:24:25,020
What?

5785
03:24:27,640 --> 03:24:28,940
What are you trying to say?

5786
03:24:29,260 --> 03:24:29,840
Question mark?

5787
03:24:31,500 --> 03:24:35,300
How does it feel to be the child?

5788
03:24:35,660 --> 03:24:35,820
Look away.

5789
03:24:38,520 --> 03:24:39,580
Yeah you tell him.

5790
03:24:39,700 --> 03:24:40,640
You're my girlfriend.

5791
03:24:41,060 --> 03:24:41,720
Frick you.

5792
03:24:44,520 --> 03:24:45,020
Oh.

5793
03:24:45,260 --> 03:24:45,760
Oh.

5794
03:24:46,980 --> 03:24:47,480
Damn.

5795
03:24:49,260 --> 03:24:51,240
That was a little bit personal.

5796
03:24:51,240 --> 03:24:52,840
I'll walk myself to the hospital.

5797
03:24:53,100 --> 03:24:53,740
That was awkward.

5798
03:24:53,740 --> 03:24:55,240
Thank you for having me.

5799
03:24:55,300 --> 03:24:56,380
I'll walk myself to the hospital.

5800
03:24:57,480 --> 03:25:01,100
This dog has dick in his hands.

5801
03:25:01,180 --> 03:25:01,820
Let me tell you that.

5802
03:25:04,100 --> 03:25:05,340
Well the fight was amazing.

5803
03:25:05,660 --> 03:25:07,620
I think Fillion's moves are really really cool.

5804
03:25:07,840 --> 03:25:09,840
And I can't wait to see how far...

5805
03:25:09,840 --> 03:25:10,380
I think...

5806
03:25:10,940 --> 03:25:12,400
I think he'll get pretty far Fillion.

5807
03:25:13,180 --> 03:25:14,640
Yeah I could tell too.

5808
03:25:14,740 --> 03:25:16,000
High flyer and heavy hitter.

5809
03:25:16,060 --> 03:25:16,360
Damn.

5810
03:25:16,420 --> 03:25:18,320
The combination of the statistics is fucking good.

5811
03:25:18,320 --> 03:25:20,400
You didn't even give Hakka a chance.

5812
03:25:20,820 --> 03:25:21,640
Impressed as hell.

5813
03:25:21,860 --> 03:25:25,060
It's a really really exhausting fucking sport.

5814
03:25:25,240 --> 03:25:26,720
So you're doing your best.

5815
03:25:26,860 --> 03:25:27,320
I'm proud of you.

5816
03:25:27,980 --> 03:25:29,020
Oh frick yeah.

5817
03:25:29,140 --> 03:25:30,460
No it was great being you too by the way.

5818
03:25:34,400 --> 03:25:37,280
Well then are we ready for our next fight?

5819
03:25:37,700 --> 03:25:39,400
Are we ready for our next fight?

5820
03:25:39,600 --> 03:25:40,080
Are we ready?

5821
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:41,240
Who's the next one?

5822
03:25:41,840 --> 03:25:43,640
Who's ready to battle?

5823
03:25:44,960 --> 03:25:46,460
Who's next in the...

5824
03:25:46,460 --> 03:25:46,920
Oh wait.

5825
03:25:46,980 --> 03:25:47,360
Oh wait wait.

5826
03:25:48,820 --> 03:25:49,940
She's gonna go casting?

5827
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:50,900
Wait is it my fight?

5828
03:25:51,980 --> 03:25:53,320
I think it is!

5829
03:25:54,820 --> 03:25:56,000
It's my fight.

5830
03:25:56,400 --> 03:25:57,920
Oh you're casting your own fight!

5831
03:25:58,260 --> 03:25:59,020
Let's fucking go!

5832
03:26:00,560 --> 03:26:01,760
We're just waiting for your opponent.

5833
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:02,880
Am I gonna cast my own fight?

5834
03:26:03,400 --> 03:26:05,020
I think so.

5835
03:26:06,240 --> 03:26:08,700
Well now that you're here, let's see.

5836
03:26:09,020 --> 03:26:11,220
I wanna see your match Octavio.

5837
03:26:11,380 --> 03:26:14,860
I wanna see your live reactions to everything.

5838
03:26:16,160 --> 03:26:18,140
Like how are you gonna face against a dragon?

5839
03:26:20,020 --> 03:26:20,720
I mean...

5840
03:26:21,220 --> 03:26:22,580
Dragon's kinda like a dinosaur.

5841
03:26:23,220 --> 03:26:24,160
So kinda easy peasy.

5842
03:26:24,160 --> 03:26:25,020
So can you take him on?

5843
03:26:25,180 --> 03:26:26,540
You guys do look like siblings.

5844
03:26:26,700 --> 03:26:27,140
Yeah!

5845
03:26:27,140 --> 03:26:28,220
I can just cut off their tails.

5846
03:26:28,820 --> 03:26:29,540
Their wings.

5847
03:26:30,360 --> 03:26:32,980
But no the difference was I fucking lost so...

5848
03:26:32,980 --> 03:26:33,840
Hello Daya!

5849
03:26:34,060 --> 03:26:34,500
Hello!

5850
03:26:36,180 --> 03:26:36,800
What's up?

5851
03:26:37,020 --> 03:26:38,060
There she is.

5852
03:26:41,280 --> 03:26:42,160
What Octavio?

5853
03:26:42,180 --> 03:26:43,120
What happened to her toughness?

5854
03:26:43,120 --> 03:26:44,140
I thought you were ready!

5855
03:26:44,140 --> 03:26:45,200
Come on bro!

5856
03:26:45,740 --> 03:26:46,340
Say it!

5857
03:26:46,880 --> 03:26:48,340
Say it right in her face!

5858
03:26:48,560 --> 03:26:49,320
Say it man!

5859
03:26:49,620 --> 03:26:49,940
Hello!

5860
03:26:50,220 --> 03:26:50,800
What's up?

5861
03:26:57,160 --> 03:26:59,220
Bro what happened to the aggression?

5862
03:26:59,960 --> 03:27:00,840
Octavio come on!

5863
03:27:00,860 --> 03:27:04,380
You were talking such mad shit on like social media.

5864
03:27:04,520 --> 03:27:05,540
You have nothing to say now!

5865
03:27:06,140 --> 03:27:08,320
Now that she's standing here you're just...

5866
03:27:08,320 --> 03:27:08,820
Hello!

5867
03:27:09,400 --> 03:27:11,560
You're a dragon.

5868
03:27:11,560 --> 03:27:13,740
No you're more like a baby worm.

5869
03:27:13,760 --> 03:27:15,080
You're actually more like a worm!

5870
03:27:15,320 --> 03:27:16,980
I'm gonna crush you beneath my heel!

5871
03:27:17,180 --> 03:27:17,820
On my boot!

5872
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:19,120
Don't talk back please!

5873
03:27:20,780 --> 03:27:21,660
That was...

5874
03:27:21,660 --> 03:27:22,380
That was pretty good.

5875
03:27:23,220 --> 03:27:23,660
Really?

5876
03:27:25,560 --> 03:27:27,100
I can't appreciate you after.

5877
03:27:27,100 --> 03:27:27,680
Thank you.

5878
03:27:28,700 --> 03:27:29,920
I'm not accepting anything.

5879
03:27:30,080 --> 03:27:30,980
Please just accept it.

5880
03:27:31,300 --> 03:27:31,920
Nah man.

5881
03:27:33,880 --> 03:27:34,320
Yay!

5882
03:27:35,440 --> 03:27:36,580
Please smack talk him.

5883
03:27:37,220 --> 03:27:38,760
I don't have anything to say to you.

5884
03:27:39,580 --> 03:27:40,400
Oh my!

5885
03:27:41,560 --> 03:27:43,060
You're so insignificant in her mind.

5886
03:27:43,060 --> 03:27:45,180
Octavio she literally called you worthless!

5887
03:27:45,460 --> 03:27:47,580
Not even worth the attention bro!

5888
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:48,360
Are you gonna accept that?

5889
03:27:48,360 --> 03:27:49,100
Not even worth the reply?

5890
03:27:49,540 --> 03:27:50,780
How dare you!

5891
03:27:51,680 --> 03:27:52,640
I'm gonna burn.

5892
03:27:52,660 --> 03:27:54,840
That fucking disrespect is insane.

5893
03:27:55,020 --> 03:27:56,620
I don't think I'm right now.

5894
03:27:56,700 --> 03:27:58,440
Bro literally said hello to me.

5895
03:28:00,320 --> 03:28:02,040
Stop doing this to me!

5896
03:28:02,160 --> 03:28:02,720
Please!

5897
03:28:02,960 --> 03:28:04,380
Come here my argument!

5898
03:28:07,380 --> 03:28:09,720
The first thing you did was like stutter to me.

5899
03:28:09,860 --> 03:28:11,540
Like you saw me drawing your face.

5900
03:28:11,560 --> 03:28:13,340
Like ugh ugh holy crap.

5901
03:28:14,060 --> 03:28:15,020
What do I do?

5902
03:28:15,160 --> 03:28:16,200
I can't believe this.

5903
03:28:16,420 --> 03:28:18,520
You are an embarrassment bro.

5904
03:28:18,760 --> 03:28:20,020
Come on not like this.

5905
03:28:20,360 --> 03:28:22,620
Come on Saya let's go to the ring.

5906
03:28:22,700 --> 03:28:23,960
I'm gonna clip your damn wings.

5907
03:28:26,540 --> 03:28:28,460
I'll let my fist do all the talking.

5908
03:28:28,920 --> 03:28:29,240
Oh!

5909
03:28:29,660 --> 03:28:30,180
Wow!

5910
03:28:32,020 --> 03:28:35,080
I ain't gonna make my puppets do my talking.

5911
03:28:35,460 --> 03:28:36,780
I have puppets.

5912
03:28:36,780 --> 03:28:38,280
They're cute and cuddly.

5913
03:28:38,600 --> 03:28:39,260
Yeah yeah.

5914
03:28:39,260 --> 03:28:40,280
They can fight for me.

5915
03:28:40,340 --> 03:28:41,460
Good for you bro.

5916
03:28:44,440 --> 03:28:45,300
That's great.

5917
03:28:46,300 --> 03:28:47,740
I'm so happy for you.

5918
03:28:49,300 --> 03:28:51,560
Wait I'm trying to catch GPT.

5919
03:28:51,560 --> 03:28:51,980
Help me.

5920
03:28:52,660 --> 03:28:54,320
Who do you think is gonna win?

5921
03:28:54,400 --> 03:28:56,380
Based on this conversation right here.

5922
03:28:57,100 --> 03:29:00,600
Octavio or Saya place in your votes right now!

5923
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:01,620
Good luck Saya.

5924
03:29:02,760 --> 03:29:03,720
You got this.

5925
03:29:05,160 --> 03:29:06,460
Please Saya please.

5926
03:29:06,460 --> 03:29:07,260
I need a skill.

5927
03:29:10,580 --> 03:29:12,220
I'm hoping for the best for Saya too.

5928
03:29:12,380 --> 03:29:13,040
Let's fucking go.

5929
03:29:13,300 --> 03:29:14,680
Octavio you're gonna go down.

5930
03:29:14,840 --> 03:29:16,600
I don't know I liked you bro.

5931
03:29:17,080 --> 03:29:17,960
Damn look at that.

5932
03:29:18,460 --> 03:29:20,340
Very handsome man.

5933
03:29:21,940 --> 03:29:22,380
Octavio.

5934
03:29:22,520 --> 03:29:23,340
Your face.

5935
03:29:23,740 --> 03:29:25,040
What happened to your face?

5936
03:29:25,720 --> 03:29:26,980
I don't know I'm slaying.

5937
03:29:27,240 --> 03:29:27,680
Slaying.

5938
03:29:30,200 --> 03:29:33,400
I think I'm catching a glimpse of what you really look like bro.

5939
03:29:35,280 --> 03:29:36,600
You mean fabulous.

5940
03:29:36,680 --> 03:29:38,440
Look at my three braids can you see?

5941
03:29:38,820 --> 03:29:40,000
Yeah you are.

5942
03:29:40,000 --> 03:29:40,340
Yeah like...

5943
03:29:40,340 --> 03:29:43,120
I don't like it.

5944
03:29:43,160 --> 03:29:43,620
Wait is Saya...

5945
03:29:43,620 --> 03:29:45,520
Does Saya have a painted body?

5946
03:29:45,680 --> 03:29:46,920
I don't like it.

5947
03:29:47,200 --> 03:29:52,040
The following contest is scheduled for one fall!

5948
03:29:55,180 --> 03:29:56,160
Introducing first.

5949
03:29:56,680 --> 03:29:58,320
From the announce desk.

5950
03:30:00,420 --> 03:30:02,460
One brutal ratio.

5951
03:30:02,560 --> 03:30:03,140
Oh wow.

5952
03:30:04,340 --> 03:30:04,820
Octavio!

5953
03:30:07,160 --> 03:30:08,220
Look at that guy.

5954
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:09,600
What a stand up guy.

5955
03:30:09,620 --> 03:30:10,640
Damn he be glowing.

5956
03:30:12,260 --> 03:30:13,220
Oh shit!

5957
03:30:13,500 --> 03:30:13,860
Oh!

5958
03:30:14,620 --> 03:30:15,580
Ay-yo!

5959
03:30:18,660 --> 03:30:20,120
Dude's got that zoom in.

5960
03:30:20,280 --> 03:30:20,740
Look at that puppet.

5961
03:30:21,320 --> 03:30:22,360
Oh there it is.

5962
03:30:22,820 --> 03:30:25,400
That is one brand by the way.

5963
03:30:25,480 --> 03:30:25,980
Holy crap.

5964
03:30:26,720 --> 03:30:28,140
I'm gonna make it fight for me.

5965
03:30:29,240 --> 03:30:30,040
What happened?

5966
03:30:30,180 --> 03:30:30,520
It disappeared.

5967
03:30:33,400 --> 03:30:33,820
I threw it away!

5968
03:30:35,020 --> 03:30:36,080
I didn't see it!

5969
03:30:37,080 --> 03:30:38,400
Okay, alright, alright.

5970
03:30:38,960 --> 03:30:41,160
We got a smoldering look from Octavio.

5971
03:30:41,980 --> 03:30:44,300
Okay, what are you gonna do?

5972
03:30:44,420 --> 03:30:45,940
Do you have a- Oh, there it is!

5973
03:30:45,940 --> 03:30:46,680
There's the gimmick!

5974
03:30:46,980 --> 03:30:47,880
There it is!

5975
03:30:48,100 --> 03:30:51,680
Ohhhhh, menacingly looking up to the ground in a wink!

5976
03:30:53,020 --> 03:30:55,000
I directed those pyrotechnics.

5977
03:30:58,020 --> 03:30:58,460
See?

5978
03:30:58,620 --> 03:30:59,040
Oh wow.

5979
03:30:59,240 --> 03:31:00,860
A lot of budget went into that outfit.

5980
03:31:00,860 --> 03:31:01,640
Wow, wow, wow.

5981
03:31:04,060 --> 03:31:05,580
I think this guy is gonna win.

5982
03:31:07,860 --> 03:31:09,040
Just my feeling.

5983
03:31:09,220 --> 03:31:11,260
Let's see, let's see what Sire looks like.

5984
03:31:12,260 --> 03:31:16,640
Let's see, because sometimes the build determines the match.

5985
03:31:17,560 --> 03:31:18,560
He's going crazy!

5986
03:31:19,960 --> 03:31:20,880
You're still going?

5987
03:31:23,560 --> 03:31:24,700
I don't know, man.

5988
03:31:24,840 --> 03:31:26,140
Look at all my strings, see?

5989
03:31:26,280 --> 03:31:27,460
I'm gonna attach those to Sire.

5990
03:31:28,380 --> 03:31:31,760
I'm gonna win without even touching her, without even punching her.

5991
03:31:33,200 --> 03:31:36,440
Oh, oh, bro, I don't want to look at the polls right now.

5992
03:31:36,500 --> 03:31:38,100
I think you're in a fucking, oh no.

5993
03:31:38,820 --> 03:31:43,060
You're so getting bodied, everyone everyone has zero faith in you.

5994
03:31:43,060 --> 03:31:44,520
Introducing his opponent!

5995
03:31:46,680 --> 03:31:49,080
From Hell!

5996
03:31:50,980 --> 03:31:51,460
Bruh?

5997
03:31:53,400 --> 03:32:05,010
She is the Slayer Sa- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Holy crap.

5998
03:32:05,250 --> 03:32:07,090
Oh wow, you brought in a torch!

5999
03:32:07,350 --> 03:32:07,890
It's not a phase mom.

6000
03:32:07,890 --> 03:32:10,110
What do you mean from hell, she's from a little cave.

6001
03:32:10,930 --> 03:32:12,230
Oh my god.

6002
03:32:12,970 --> 03:32:13,950
It's not a phase.

6003
03:32:13,970 --> 03:32:15,330
Stop burning the stage.

6004
03:32:15,850 --> 03:32:17,590
Shout out to the mom out here.

6005
03:32:20,050 --> 03:32:22,090
Your daughter's lighting up the fucking stage.

6006
03:32:27,330 --> 03:32:29,250
Dude, does your mom know you're VTubing?

6007
03:32:29,370 --> 03:32:29,950
The arena is burning.

6008
03:32:30,750 --> 03:32:32,090
Does your mom know you're VTubing?

6009
03:32:33,630 --> 03:32:34,030
Yes.

6010
03:32:35,050 --> 03:32:35,850
Mine doesn't.

6011
03:32:36,070 --> 03:32:36,470
No.

6012
03:32:36,990 --> 03:32:39,090
Imagine if she actually stumbles onto this WWE street.

6013
03:32:39,090 --> 03:32:40,270
Are you ashamed of yourself?

6014
03:32:41,050 --> 03:32:41,990
Of course I am!

6015
03:32:44,010 --> 03:32:45,510
Mom, is that what you think?

6016
03:32:45,510 --> 03:32:45,770
Excuse me.

6017
03:32:46,510 --> 03:32:47,650
VTubing is for the cool kids.

6018
03:32:50,110 --> 03:32:51,590
I'm doing voice acting, mom.

6019
03:32:51,670 --> 03:32:52,070
I swear.

6020
03:32:53,350 --> 03:32:54,550
VTubers are the new jocks.

6021
03:32:55,970 --> 03:32:57,310
I make money, mom.

6022
03:32:58,130 --> 03:32:58,730
I swear.

6023
03:32:58,730 --> 03:32:59,510
It's not a phase, I swear.

6024
03:33:03,270 --> 03:33:03,990
Entering the ring.

6025
03:33:04,130 --> 03:33:06,090
And no pyrotechnics.

6026
03:33:06,870 --> 03:33:08,370
I guess she loses in terms of like...

6027
03:33:08,370 --> 03:33:09,350
She's big and bulky again.

6028
03:33:09,410 --> 03:33:09,730
Look at that.

6029
03:33:09,830 --> 03:33:11,010
She's gonna be tall, I swear to god.

6030
03:33:11,290 --> 03:33:12,250
She's gonna be seven feet tall.

6031
03:33:12,990 --> 03:33:14,390
Is she gonna be?

6032
03:33:14,590 --> 03:33:16,350
I'm just gonna be 5'8".

6033
03:33:18,950 --> 03:33:19,610
Here we go.

6034
03:33:20,570 --> 03:33:21,290
Oh wow.

6035
03:33:21,490 --> 03:33:22,010
Oh wow.

6036
03:33:22,830 --> 03:33:24,450
They're both doing the same thing.

6037
03:33:24,610 --> 03:33:26,070
They're both doing the same thing.

6038
03:33:27,070 --> 03:33:28,910
But the only winner is one.

6039
03:33:29,050 --> 03:33:29,910
Who's it gonna be?

6040
03:33:30,090 --> 03:33:30,510
Oh, kick.

6041
03:33:30,650 --> 03:33:31,750
Oh my god.

6042
03:33:32,050 --> 03:33:33,030
It may get stuck.

6043
03:33:33,250 --> 03:33:34,650
And they're having a cat fight.

6044
03:33:34,670 --> 03:33:35,770
Oh, ripping off the hair.

6045
03:33:36,010 --> 03:33:36,730
Oh, not the hair.

6046
03:33:36,870 --> 03:33:37,570
Ripping off the arms.

6047
03:33:38,830 --> 03:33:39,890
Clipping the arms.

6048
03:33:40,070 --> 03:33:41,970
Like the wings of an angel.

6049
03:33:44,210 --> 03:33:44,650
Reversal.

6050
03:33:44,650 --> 03:33:45,090
Grapple.

6051
03:33:45,310 --> 03:33:45,790
And oh!

6052
03:33:48,290 --> 03:33:49,270
Oh my god.

6053
03:33:49,350 --> 03:33:50,950
Octavia, you might actually fucking win.

6054
03:33:51,030 --> 03:33:51,790
Oh my god.

6055
03:33:51,790 --> 03:33:52,070
Octavia, you might actually fucking win.

6056
03:33:52,070 --> 03:33:52,170
Oh my god.

6057
03:33:52,210 --> 03:33:52,970
What the fuck is that?

6058
03:33:54,690 --> 03:33:56,070
Dude's flexing out here, buddy!

6059
03:33:56,870 --> 03:33:57,510
Guys, guys.

6060
03:33:58,230 --> 03:34:02,090
I think the statistics in the voting system is false.

6061
03:34:02,630 --> 03:34:04,030
Octavia may have a chance here.

6062
03:34:04,690 --> 03:34:05,590
A butt dive.

6063
03:34:06,750 --> 03:34:07,750
Oh, oh, oh.

6064
03:34:08,290 --> 03:34:09,250
Twist in the neck.

6065
03:34:09,410 --> 03:34:10,650
Yeah, dislocate that head.

6066
03:34:10,670 --> 03:34:11,090
Here it is.

6067
03:34:11,690 --> 03:34:12,510
Is it a tap out?

6068
03:34:12,710 --> 03:34:15,670
Oh no, it wasn't a tap out.

6069
03:34:15,870 --> 03:34:17,010
It wasn't a submission move.

6070
03:34:17,890 --> 03:34:18,690
Oh, stunner.

6071
03:34:19,550 --> 03:34:20,030
Stunner.

6072
03:34:20,390 --> 03:34:22,090
Oh, is this a finisher?

6073
03:34:22,590 --> 03:34:23,630
Is this a finisher?

6074
03:34:24,570 --> 03:34:26,210
Oh no, it's just a taunt.

6075
03:34:27,190 --> 03:34:29,470
Octavia with the aggressive play here.

6076
03:34:30,110 --> 03:34:30,950
Bashing in.

6077
03:34:31,070 --> 03:34:32,410
Oh my god, here's a pin!

6078
03:34:32,550 --> 03:34:32,890
A pin already!

6079
03:34:34,710 --> 03:34:36,150
And the kick out.

6080
03:34:36,830 --> 03:34:42,030
Saya, if you ever want to win, you better fight back because Octavia is on a fucking roll here.

6081
03:34:42,170 --> 03:34:43,690
And a smash to the fucking stage.

6082
03:34:43,690 --> 03:34:44,430
Damn, focus on those arms.

6083
03:34:44,730 --> 03:34:45,330
Let's go.

6084
03:34:47,050 --> 03:34:48,330
Saya, come on.

6085
03:34:49,290 --> 03:34:50,910
We went past the...

6086
03:34:50,910 --> 03:34:52,410
Do I still not deserve a replay?

6087
03:34:52,530 --> 03:34:52,790
Oh, missed!

6088
03:34:54,450 --> 03:34:56,570
Oh my god, and a head bash!

6089
03:34:56,630 --> 03:34:57,350
Oh god!

6090
03:35:00,290 --> 03:35:03,210
Animalistic behavior by smashing the head.

6091
03:35:04,810 --> 03:35:06,130
Oh my god, here we go.

6092
03:35:06,950 --> 03:35:07,730
Headbutt combo here.

6093
03:35:07,730 --> 03:35:08,670
No, don't do this to me!

6094
03:35:08,870 --> 03:35:09,390
And a slam!

6095
03:35:09,590 --> 03:35:12,390
Two seconds in, but barely a scratch to Octavia.

6096
03:35:13,490 --> 03:35:16,790
You're gonna have to do more than that to actually do some more.

6097
03:35:17,070 --> 03:35:17,570
Thank you.

6098
03:35:17,570 --> 03:35:17,570
Thank you.

6099
03:35:18,870 --> 03:35:20,450
This is kinda nerve-wracking.

6100
03:35:20,750 --> 03:35:21,390
Woah!

6101
03:35:23,910 --> 03:35:24,550
Aggression.

6102
03:35:24,750 --> 03:35:27,510
Athleticism is being shown through the screen.

6103
03:35:27,850 --> 03:35:29,810
They're both still fighting outside.

6104
03:35:31,070 --> 03:35:31,710
Oooh!

6105
03:35:32,730 --> 03:35:35,230
Pull those strings, puppet man.

6106
03:35:36,750 --> 03:35:38,430
Nothing but dirty plays.

6107
03:35:39,010 --> 03:35:39,650
And...

6108
03:35:39,650 --> 03:35:41,390
What do you mean nothing but dirty plays?

6109
03:35:41,430 --> 03:35:42,030
This is all legit.

6110
03:35:43,350 --> 03:35:44,790
It is dirty play.

6111
03:35:45,190 --> 03:35:47,510
You're not fighting into the stage.

6112
03:35:47,510 --> 03:35:47,850
See?

6113
03:35:48,430 --> 03:35:49,810
No, that's not allowed.

6114
03:35:50,390 --> 03:35:51,530
Oh, they're back in.

6115
03:35:51,590 --> 03:35:52,330
Okay, they're back in.

6116
03:35:53,010 --> 03:35:54,330
Octavia, what are you doing?

6117
03:35:54,690 --> 03:35:55,910
Octavia, you...

6118
03:35:57,150 --> 03:35:58,290
You arrogant prick.

6119
03:35:58,390 --> 03:35:59,210
Get inside the ring.

6120
03:36:01,450 --> 03:36:02,070
Pin him.

6121
03:36:02,150 --> 03:36:02,790
Pin him down!

6122
03:36:03,550 --> 03:36:04,030
Oh!

6123
03:36:04,150 --> 03:36:04,630
Damn!

6124
03:36:05,550 --> 03:36:06,670
Is this it?

6125
03:36:07,370 --> 03:36:08,690
Oh, high flyer technique!

6126
03:36:09,010 --> 03:36:09,630
Oh, he's gonna dive.

6127
03:36:11,610 --> 03:36:12,090
Woah!

6128
03:36:12,390 --> 03:36:12,870
Shit!

6129
03:36:13,290 --> 03:36:14,030
It's over.

6130
03:36:14,190 --> 03:36:14,970
It's so over.

6131
03:36:15,490 --> 03:36:16,350
And a pin.

6132
03:36:16,430 --> 03:36:16,750
One...

6133
03:36:17,510 --> 03:36:17,850
Two!

6134
03:36:17,850 --> 03:36:18,310
Oh!

6135
03:36:18,490 --> 03:36:19,190
Kicked out!

6136
03:36:20,530 --> 03:36:23,390
There may be hope here for Sia fans out here.

6137
03:36:23,790 --> 03:36:24,310
Dragons don't exist.

6138
03:36:24,310 --> 03:36:26,650
And doing a taunt of all things!

6139
03:36:28,330 --> 03:36:31,070
The absolute confidence is in this motherfucker.

6140
03:36:31,430 --> 03:36:34,090
Stay in your... Stay in your fictionary books.

6141
03:36:34,410 --> 03:36:35,230
Fictional books.

6142
03:36:36,170 --> 03:36:37,050
Where you belong.

6143
03:36:37,670 --> 03:36:39,650
Throw in the corner and another punch.

6144
03:36:40,190 --> 03:36:40,890
Knocked down.

6145
03:36:40,990 --> 03:36:41,550
There's nothing...

6146
03:36:41,550 --> 03:36:41,830
Ouch.

6147
03:36:42,190 --> 03:36:43,190
Oh no, not the reversal.

6148
03:36:43,190 --> 03:36:45,130
I feel so sorry for Sia right now.

6149
03:36:45,430 --> 03:36:46,170
Oh wait.

6150
03:36:46,270 --> 03:36:46,790
Come back.

6151
03:36:46,810 --> 03:36:47,410
Come back in the real world.

6152
03:36:47,510 --> 03:36:47,730
Oh no.

6153
03:36:47,950 --> 03:36:48,690
Is it?

6154
03:36:49,230 --> 03:36:49,930
Is it?

6155
03:36:49,950 --> 03:36:50,370
Oh!

6156
03:36:51,430 --> 03:36:52,470
My head!

6157
03:36:52,850 --> 03:36:57,430
We got a grapple technique here but not enough to actually put him in a stunning stage.

6158
03:36:58,610 --> 03:37:02,110
So far we've seen Octavio body Sia.

6159
03:37:02,830 --> 03:37:03,790
What's happening?

6160
03:37:04,910 --> 03:37:05,690
I don't know.

6161
03:37:05,690 --> 03:37:06,670
They're just going in and out.

6162
03:37:07,590 --> 03:37:08,450
In and out.

6163
03:37:08,450 --> 03:37:09,370
What's going on?

6164
03:37:09,650 --> 03:37:10,650
I don't know!

6165
03:37:11,050 --> 03:37:12,010
But it's something!

6166
03:37:12,270 --> 03:37:12,430
Oh!

6167
03:37:12,810 --> 03:37:13,610
Oh no!

6168
03:37:15,470 --> 03:37:15,950
No!

6169
03:37:16,490 --> 03:37:17,650
Don't put me on the...

6170
03:37:17,650 --> 03:37:19,530
And head to the turnbuckle.

6171
03:37:19,670 --> 03:37:20,790
Oh damn.

6172
03:37:20,970 --> 03:37:22,110
What are you doing Sia?

6173
03:37:22,750 --> 03:37:23,710
Sia what are you doing?

6174
03:37:24,010 --> 03:37:24,970
Sia what are you doing?

6175
03:37:25,090 --> 03:37:26,190
Sia I think you're...

6176
03:37:26,190 --> 03:37:26,970
Oh my god.

6177
03:37:27,210 --> 03:37:27,990
What the hell?

6178
03:37:28,790 --> 03:37:29,610
Is this it?

6179
03:37:29,610 --> 03:37:30,010
Is this it?

6180
03:37:30,250 --> 03:37:30,730
No!

6181
03:37:32,550 --> 03:37:33,030
No!

6182
03:37:34,490 --> 03:37:35,450
Oh shit!

6183
03:37:35,830 --> 03:37:36,910
Oh I'm stunned!

6184
03:37:37,910 --> 03:37:38,690
Is this it?

6185
03:37:38,750 --> 03:37:39,450
One trick pony!

6186
03:37:39,850 --> 03:37:40,330
One!

6187
03:37:40,830 --> 03:37:41,310
Oh!

6188
03:37:42,050 --> 03:37:43,190
Just a one count.

6189
03:37:43,290 --> 03:37:44,250
Good job, good job.

6190
03:37:46,810 --> 03:37:47,250
Okay.

6191
03:37:47,330 --> 03:37:48,010
What are you doing?

6192
03:37:48,750 --> 03:37:50,570
Not even worth a second count.

6193
03:37:51,130 --> 03:37:52,250
Position her correctly.

6194
03:37:53,490 --> 03:37:54,190
Oh no.

6195
03:37:54,510 --> 03:37:55,790
Oh, oh, oh, a reversal!

6196
03:37:56,810 --> 03:37:57,250
Ayo!

6197
03:38:00,830 --> 03:38:01,270
Octavio!

6198
03:38:02,930 --> 03:38:03,370
Damn.

6199
03:38:06,670 --> 03:38:07,110
Okay.

6200
03:38:07,350 --> 03:38:08,030
More of this?

6201
03:38:08,090 --> 03:38:08,390
Oh wow.

6202
03:38:08,510 --> 03:38:10,090
The ref is in the fucking way.

6203
03:38:11,710 --> 03:38:12,970
Get out of the way!

6204
03:38:14,110 --> 03:38:14,630
Submission!

6205
03:38:14,850 --> 03:38:15,370
Submission!

6206
03:38:15,670 --> 03:38:16,530
Is this it?

6207
03:38:16,570 --> 03:38:18,570
Oh no, no.

6208
03:38:18,570 --> 03:38:19,170
It wasn't a tap out.

6209
03:38:19,670 --> 03:38:20,570
She got out.

6210
03:38:20,650 --> 03:38:21,390
Durability high.

6211
03:38:21,850 --> 03:38:22,370
Oh!

6212
03:38:22,510 --> 03:38:23,710
An exchange of blows!

6213
03:38:23,710 --> 03:38:25,090
A slap in the face!

6214
03:38:25,810 --> 03:38:27,010
Oh come on!

6215
03:38:27,630 --> 03:38:28,270
Let's go!

6216
03:38:28,830 --> 03:38:29,110
Ay!

6217
03:38:29,990 --> 03:38:30,510
Ay!

6218
03:38:31,490 --> 03:38:32,010
Ay!

6219
03:38:33,650 --> 03:38:34,590
Why'd you punch me?

6220
03:38:34,670 --> 03:38:34,870
Ay!

6221
03:38:34,970 --> 03:38:36,710
Nothing but back and forth here.

6222
03:38:36,770 --> 03:38:37,550
And a counter.

6223
03:38:37,750 --> 03:38:38,070
Oh!

6224
03:38:39,590 --> 03:38:40,950
First blood everybody!

6225
03:38:41,310 --> 03:38:41,910
First blood!

6226
03:38:43,530 --> 03:38:44,710
Nothing but blood.

6227
03:38:44,810 --> 03:38:45,130
Help me!

6228
03:38:46,370 --> 03:38:47,310
It's so over.

6229
03:38:47,530 --> 03:38:48,590
It's so over.

6230
03:38:49,090 --> 03:38:50,010
It's so over.

6231
03:38:50,110 --> 03:38:51,030
Oh shit!

6232
03:38:51,230 --> 03:38:51,370
Whoa!

6233
03:38:51,890 --> 03:38:52,530
That's it!

6234
03:38:52,690 --> 03:38:53,250
That's it!

6235
03:38:53,370 --> 03:38:53,750
It's over!

6236
03:38:54,530 --> 03:38:55,330
I flew.

6237
03:38:57,930 --> 03:38:58,750
Stunner is real.

6238
03:38:58,810 --> 03:38:59,390
Stunner is real.

6239
03:38:59,510 --> 03:39:00,230
Oh not my legs.

6240
03:39:00,250 --> 03:39:00,790
Not my legs.

6241
03:39:01,030 --> 03:39:02,270
Oh no, no.

6242
03:39:03,090 --> 03:39:05,510
Okay this match is gonna be...

6243
03:39:05,510 --> 03:39:05,630
I'm limping.

6244
03:39:05,790 --> 03:39:06,310
Oh!

6245
03:39:06,670 --> 03:39:07,190
Reverse!

6246
03:39:07,230 --> 03:39:10,070
This match is closer than I expected.

6247
03:39:10,390 --> 03:39:10,910
Whoa!

6248
03:39:11,310 --> 03:39:11,850
This is it!

6249
03:39:11,950 --> 03:39:12,330
Oh!

6250
03:39:12,530 --> 03:39:13,130
This is it!

6251
03:39:13,130 --> 03:39:13,510
One!

6252
03:39:13,950 --> 03:39:14,430
Two!

6253
03:39:15,070 --> 03:39:16,050
Oh kick out.

6254
03:39:17,590 --> 03:39:18,090
Please help me!

6255
03:39:18,870 --> 03:39:21,750
Unfortunately Octavio you're gonna have to fight for that one.

6256
03:39:23,850 --> 03:39:24,950
Why is this such a hard battle?

6257
03:39:24,950 --> 03:39:25,730
Rattling each other again.

6258
03:39:26,150 --> 03:39:26,950
Throw it again.

6259
03:39:27,290 --> 03:39:28,230
Into the corner.

6260
03:39:28,830 --> 03:39:29,870
Octavio with the advantage.

6261
03:39:30,010 --> 03:39:30,970
Doing a little dance!

6262
03:39:31,030 --> 03:39:31,870
What the fuck!

6263
03:39:31,930 --> 03:39:32,850
Get puppeteered!

6264
03:39:33,130 --> 03:39:34,830
Get puppeteered!

6265
03:39:35,310 --> 03:39:35,930
It's over.

6266
03:39:36,050 --> 03:39:36,530
Get puppeteered!

6267
03:39:36,850 --> 03:39:37,670
And boom!

6268
03:39:39,390 --> 03:39:40,210
It's over.

6269
03:39:40,270 --> 03:39:40,890
It's over.

6270
03:39:41,350 --> 03:39:42,130
It's over.

6271
03:39:42,290 --> 03:39:42,610
It's down.

6272
03:39:42,670 --> 03:39:42,910
It's over.

6273
03:39:42,910 --> 03:39:42,910
It's down.

6274
03:39:42,910 --> 03:39:43,870
Oh what are you doing referee?

6275
03:39:44,070 --> 03:39:44,570
One!

6276
03:39:44,810 --> 03:39:45,410
Two!

6277
03:39:45,970 --> 03:39:46,570
Three!

6278
03:39:48,210 --> 03:39:50,730
SwiftTavio advances to the next round!

6279
03:39:51,690 --> 03:39:52,290
SwiftTavio advances to the next round!

6280
03:39:52,290 --> 03:39:54,050
Here is your winner...

6281
03:39:55,250 --> 03:39:55,850
Octavio!

6282
03:39:56,050 --> 03:39:56,510
Octavio!

6283
03:40:00,030 --> 03:40:01,610
That's the fearless fit there!

6284
03:40:02,490 --> 03:40:04,030
Shoutout to Mother Taylor Swift!

6285
03:40:04,510 --> 03:40:05,110
Oh...

6286
03:40:05,110 --> 03:40:05,390
Oh, God.

6287
03:40:08,730 --> 03:40:09,170
Octavio.

6288
03:40:09,170 --> 03:40:09,610
Octavio.

6289
03:40:09,650 --> 03:40:10,950
You're in love for Taylor Swift.

6290
03:40:10,950 --> 03:40:13,090
Never cease to disappoint them.

6291
03:40:13,770 --> 03:40:14,650
It's fearless.

6292
03:40:17,150 --> 03:40:18,870
That was a great, great ranking.

6293
03:40:18,870 --> 03:40:19,790
Yeah, it was a great match.

6294
03:40:19,910 --> 03:40:20,270
Great job!

6295
03:40:20,570 --> 03:40:22,670
Just a little bit disappointed though.

6296
03:40:22,790 --> 03:40:24,730
I had high expectations that you'd lose.

6297
03:40:25,110 --> 03:40:26,350
You look so fucking dumb.

6298
03:40:26,450 --> 03:40:27,910
I hate your character design, Octavio!

6299
03:40:28,010 --> 03:40:29,050
I fucking hate it!

6300
03:40:29,510 --> 03:40:30,290
How'd you win?

6301
03:40:30,530 --> 03:40:31,450
Why'd you win?

6302
03:40:31,450 --> 03:40:31,770
I didn't lose.

6303
03:40:33,630 --> 03:40:34,850
Well, um...

6304
03:40:34,850 --> 03:40:35,410
Hey, Saya.

6305
03:40:35,730 --> 03:40:38,210
That was definitely a good thought.

6306
03:40:40,210 --> 03:40:41,330
You get wrecked.

6307
03:40:41,390 --> 03:40:42,530
That was a lot of back and forth.

6308
03:40:42,530 --> 03:40:46,570
Are you now gonna reply to my fire insults?

6309
03:40:48,770 --> 03:40:50,690
She doesn't even care, bro.

6310
03:40:51,010 --> 03:40:51,890
No, she doesn't.

6311
03:40:52,050 --> 03:40:53,550
I won!

6312
03:40:55,230 --> 03:40:55,870
Please?

6313
03:40:58,190 --> 03:40:59,790
Say something at least!

6314
03:40:59,790 --> 03:41:00,810
Say something!

6315
03:41:01,930 --> 03:41:05,930
Saya, you need help being escorted out of the building without...

6316
03:41:06,450 --> 03:41:07,390
I need help.

6317
03:41:07,510 --> 03:41:09,730
I can help you get out of here.

6318
03:41:09,730 --> 03:41:10,630
I need help, please.

6319
03:41:10,690 --> 03:41:11,430
Okay, I got you.

6320
03:41:11,430 --> 03:41:11,910
I got you.

6321
03:41:12,310 --> 03:41:13,670
I'll cover you and everything.

6322
03:41:13,890 --> 03:41:14,490
Call me stinky.

6323
03:41:14,690 --> 03:41:15,290
Call me small.

6324
03:41:15,470 --> 03:41:16,050
Call me bad.

6325
03:41:16,050 --> 03:41:17,070
Call me... I don't know.

6326
03:41:17,670 --> 03:41:19,890
And you're calling me a masochist, Jesus Christ.

6327
03:41:19,970 --> 03:41:21,370
You're begging for insults.

6328
03:41:21,430 --> 03:41:21,910
Bro!

6329
03:41:22,270 --> 03:41:22,710
Well fought.

6330
03:41:22,990 --> 03:41:23,270
No!

6331
03:41:24,130 --> 03:41:25,190
Learn some humility.

6332
03:41:25,430 --> 03:41:26,250
We're in another channel.

6333
03:41:26,250 --> 03:41:27,830
I feel like I lost.

6334
03:41:27,910 --> 03:41:29,670
Any afterthoughts after this fight?

6335
03:41:29,810 --> 03:41:30,190
No.

6336
03:41:31,730 --> 03:41:32,810
I have no thoughts.

6337
03:41:32,930 --> 03:41:33,970
Just depression.

6338
03:41:34,130 --> 03:41:34,590
No thoughts.

6339
03:41:34,590 --> 03:41:38,350
That entire fight felt like... no thoughts, head empty.

6340
03:41:41,310 --> 03:41:41,870
Damn.

6341
03:41:42,610 --> 03:41:43,970
Indifference hurts more.

6342
03:41:44,790 --> 03:41:45,810
Yes, it does, bro.

6343
03:41:46,110 --> 03:41:46,890
That's crazy.

6344
03:41:47,270 --> 03:41:48,110
That's crazy.

6345
03:41:48,330 --> 03:41:48,750
Ow.

6346
03:41:49,070 --> 03:41:50,610
I won, but I lost.

6347
03:41:51,230 --> 03:41:53,590
I guess, Octavio, congrats on winning.

6348
03:41:53,870 --> 03:41:55,930
Dude, that's a fucking trumpet.

6349
03:41:55,990 --> 03:41:56,370
Thank you.

6350
03:41:56,710 --> 03:41:57,510
I'm sorry.

6351
03:41:57,930 --> 03:41:58,750
I'm sorry.

6352
03:41:58,950 --> 03:41:59,490
I agree.

6353
03:42:00,130 --> 03:42:01,430
I'm really happy for you.

6354
03:42:01,430 --> 03:42:02,430
I really do.

6355
03:42:02,710 --> 03:42:05,230
I hope you perform better in the next match.

6356
03:42:05,390 --> 03:42:05,930
Thank you.

6357
03:42:05,950 --> 03:42:06,410
Are we done now?

6358
03:42:06,530 --> 03:42:07,370
Are we done glazing you?

6359
03:42:07,690 --> 03:42:08,130
Congratulations.

6360
03:42:08,710 --> 03:42:09,330
You won.

6361
03:42:09,630 --> 03:42:10,470
You won, buddy.

6362
03:42:11,030 --> 03:42:11,910
You're happy now?

6363
03:42:12,130 --> 03:42:12,230
Yes.

6364
03:42:12,790 --> 03:42:14,870
Well, thank you, Sia, for joining us.

6365
03:42:14,950 --> 03:42:16,550
You were amazing and you're super slay.

6366
03:42:16,590 --> 03:42:17,030
Thank you.

6367
03:42:17,030 --> 03:42:17,790
Thanks for having me.

6368
03:42:18,030 --> 03:42:18,770
Thank you.

6369
03:42:20,030 --> 03:42:20,630
Bye, Paul.

6370
03:42:20,630 --> 03:42:21,570
Thank you for not beating me.

6371
03:42:22,530 --> 03:42:23,830
Bye-bye, Sia.

6372
03:42:24,170 --> 03:42:24,590
Bye-bye.

6373
03:42:25,530 --> 03:42:26,230
Bye-bye.

6374
03:42:27,410 --> 03:42:28,270
Oh, man.

6375
03:42:28,510 --> 03:42:29,330
The next match.

6376
03:42:29,670 --> 03:42:30,070
Oh, man.

6377
03:42:30,250 --> 03:42:31,110
The next match.

6378
03:42:31,110 --> 03:42:31,330
Next match.

6379
03:42:31,370 --> 03:42:31,410
Next match.

6380
03:42:31,410 --> 03:42:31,810
This match is crazy.

6381
03:42:33,750 --> 03:42:34,790
Oh, shit.

6382
03:42:35,290 --> 03:42:36,890
I'm excited for this one.

6383
03:42:37,110 --> 03:42:37,590
I'm excited for this one.

6384
03:42:37,890 --> 03:42:38,910
What is happening?

6385
03:42:39,170 --> 03:42:39,570
Why?

6386
03:42:41,930 --> 03:42:42,450
Okay.

6387
03:42:42,690 --> 03:42:43,070
Oh, what?

6388
03:42:43,650 --> 03:42:44,170
Yeah.

6389
03:42:44,310 --> 03:42:44,830
Okay.

6390
03:42:45,190 --> 03:42:45,710
Yeah.

6391
03:42:45,810 --> 03:42:46,110
Oh.

6392
03:42:46,170 --> 03:42:46,690
What?

6393
03:42:47,050 --> 03:42:47,570
Yeah.

6394
03:42:47,570 --> 03:42:47,870
Yeah.

6395
03:42:47,870 --> 03:42:48,050
Yeah.

6396
03:42:48,110 --> 03:42:49,030
Battle two.

6397
03:42:51,250 --> 03:42:52,550
The twins are here.

6398
03:42:52,750 --> 03:42:53,010
Oh, no.

6399
03:42:53,010 --> 03:42:54,230
I thought that was a joke.

6400
03:42:54,350 --> 03:42:55,050
What the fuck?

6401
03:42:55,590 --> 03:42:56,730
No, but it's not.

6402
03:42:56,890 --> 03:42:57,250
Are they here?

6403
03:42:57,250 --> 03:42:57,630
It's real.

6404
03:42:57,650 --> 03:42:58,630
Are they actually here?

6405
03:43:00,190 --> 03:43:01,330
Oh, my fucking God.

6406
03:43:01,390 --> 03:43:02,570
Battle one and battle two.

6407
03:43:03,250 --> 03:43:03,990
Hey, everybody.

6408
03:43:04,190 --> 03:43:04,930
Good to see you.

6409
03:43:05,490 --> 03:43:05,930
It's not.

6410
03:43:05,930 --> 03:43:06,790
It's so scenery.

6411
03:43:07,190 --> 03:43:07,910
Excuse me.

6412
03:43:07,930 --> 03:43:08,350
Excuse me.

6413
03:43:08,450 --> 03:43:09,450
No, no, no.

6414
03:43:09,510 --> 03:43:11,330
I've been suffering from a terrible cold.

6415
03:43:11,450 --> 03:43:13,390
I've just been having a hard time recently.

6416
03:43:13,430 --> 03:43:14,290
Hey, everybody.

6417
03:43:14,390 --> 03:43:15,150
How's it going?

6418
03:43:16,210 --> 03:43:18,710
Yeah, you're going to be suffering from a little bit more after this.

6419
03:43:18,970 --> 03:43:22,090
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

6420
03:43:22,130 --> 03:43:23,190
Trash talking starts immediately.

6421
03:43:24,010 --> 03:43:25,250
Listen, listen, listen.

6422
03:43:25,510 --> 03:43:28,830
We might be twins, but we are also fraternal twins.

6423
03:43:28,890 --> 03:43:30,950
That means our fighting styles will be different.

6424
03:43:30,970 --> 03:43:31,370
We are also fraternal twins.

6425
03:43:31,370 --> 03:43:36,030
And frankly, frankly, this is payback for taking all the nutrients in the womb.

6426
03:43:36,930 --> 03:43:39,910
Oh, I mean, you can use them.

6427
03:43:41,010 --> 03:43:42,390
Twins relate, everybody.

6428
03:43:42,450 --> 03:43:42,990
Twins relate.

6429
03:43:43,450 --> 03:43:46,570
Would you like to explain how your fighting styles differ?

6430
03:43:47,390 --> 03:43:51,490
Well, mine is a winning style and his is a losing style.

6431
03:43:51,610 --> 03:43:56,290
So it is kind of a drastic difference if you catch my drift.

6432
03:43:56,490 --> 03:43:57,050
I see.

6433
03:43:57,070 --> 03:43:57,250
I see.

6434
03:43:57,710 --> 03:44:00,150
Well, we'll see, brother.

6435
03:44:00,270 --> 03:44:00,750
We'll see.

6436
03:44:01,370 --> 03:44:04,110
Which one of us has the recessive genes and the dominant ones?

6437
03:44:04,370 --> 03:44:06,010
Well, I don't even know what that means.

6438
03:44:06,150 --> 03:44:07,310
I don't even know what that means.

6439
03:44:08,170 --> 03:44:09,590
Didn't know we got genetics in here.

6440
03:44:11,250 --> 03:44:14,190
This is a family feud for sure.

6441
03:44:14,350 --> 03:44:15,010
It is personal.

6442
03:44:15,290 --> 03:44:15,950
It sure is.

6443
03:44:15,950 --> 03:44:16,330
It's personal.

6444
03:44:16,830 --> 03:44:18,130
I know you guys are fighting.

6445
03:44:18,230 --> 03:44:21,710
This is a rivalry that started from the womb and will end in the tomb.

6446
03:44:22,190 --> 03:44:28,070
Well, I know you guys are fighting, but how does it feel to, you know, be in the same room as each other after a while?

6447
03:44:29,150 --> 03:44:29,910
You know...

6448
03:44:31,470 --> 03:44:31,950
Terrible.

6449
03:44:32,070 --> 03:44:32,550
Oh.

6450
03:44:32,730 --> 03:44:33,490
Honestly awful.

6451
03:44:33,750 --> 03:44:34,450
It's really awful.

6452
03:44:34,890 --> 03:44:38,450
Honestly, this guy's been pissing me off for too long.

6453
03:44:39,130 --> 03:44:39,830
I'm done with this.

6454
03:44:39,830 --> 03:44:40,970
It was a surprise to be here.

6455
03:44:41,130 --> 03:44:43,150
And I'm not a good surprise.

6456
03:44:43,210 --> 03:44:45,070
A bad surprise that I have to fight him, honestly.

6457
03:44:45,330 --> 03:44:45,410
Oh.

6458
03:44:45,690 --> 03:44:47,430
I'll strut you in there and you're gonna die.

6459
03:44:48,170 --> 03:44:49,450
They love each other.

6460
03:44:49,750 --> 03:44:50,230
Yeah.

6461
03:44:50,650 --> 03:44:51,670
And I love him.

6462
03:44:51,710 --> 03:44:51,830
Brother, they love.

6463
03:44:52,170 --> 03:44:52,910
I love him.

6464
03:44:52,990 --> 03:44:53,270
Aww.

6465
03:44:53,810 --> 03:44:54,290
Aww.

6466
03:44:55,370 --> 03:44:57,970
None of that sucky-wucky stuff here.

6467
03:44:58,070 --> 03:44:59,150
It's all violence.

6468
03:44:59,710 --> 03:45:00,370
Oh, okay.

6469
03:45:00,370 --> 03:45:00,890
Well.

6470
03:45:01,490 --> 03:45:01,970
Well.

6471
03:45:02,090 --> 03:45:04,370
I wish both of you the best of luck.

6472
03:45:04,530 --> 03:45:09,470
I definitely don't have bias in who wins in this match either, but good luck.

6473
03:45:09,470 --> 03:45:10,170
I'm curious though.

6474
03:45:10,450 --> 03:45:10,930
Yeah.

6475
03:45:10,970 --> 03:45:11,310
Thank you.

6476
03:45:11,410 --> 03:45:12,530
Who's the strongest twin?

6477
03:45:12,670 --> 03:45:13,790
We will find out.

6478
03:45:13,970 --> 03:45:15,430
Everybody put in your votes.

6479
03:45:15,590 --> 03:45:16,470
Who's gonna win?

6480
03:45:16,690 --> 03:45:18,990
Battle one or battle two?

6481
03:45:19,090 --> 03:45:20,430
Put in your votes, everybody.

6482
03:45:21,270 --> 03:45:22,150
There we go.

6483
03:45:22,170 --> 03:45:22,630
There we go.

6484
03:45:22,670 --> 03:45:23,570
While that is running.

6485
03:45:24,050 --> 03:45:25,290
Any final words?

6486
03:45:25,990 --> 03:45:26,470
Nothing?

6487
03:45:26,670 --> 03:45:26,930
Okay.

6488
03:45:27,030 --> 03:45:27,190
Let's fucking go.

6489
03:45:27,190 --> 03:45:28,030
Why am I losing the call?

6490
03:45:29,410 --> 03:45:31,310
We both know why you're losing the poll, come on?

6491
03:45:31,350 --> 03:45:33,290
Holy crap, what is that abomination?

6492
03:45:34,210 --> 03:45:36,130
The poll is up and running.

6493
03:45:38,190 --> 03:45:40,790
And just for the sake of it, I'm just gonna vote for battle.

6494
03:45:40,890 --> 03:45:41,210
Let's see.

6495
03:45:41,270 --> 03:45:41,750
Let's see the...

6496
03:45:41,750 --> 03:45:43,430
Oh my God, that is a large margin.

6497
03:45:43,550 --> 03:45:44,430
Battle two is winning.

6498
03:45:46,110 --> 03:45:46,970
Oh my God.

6499
03:45:46,970 --> 03:45:47,910
Battle two looks handsome.

6500
03:45:47,910 --> 03:45:48,630
Battle two is winning.

6501
03:45:48,630 --> 03:45:49,610
What a damper fellow.

6502
03:45:50,650 --> 03:45:51,750
He has a cape, too.

6503
03:45:52,790 --> 03:45:53,590
Holy shit.

6504
03:45:53,650 --> 03:45:54,450
Let's fucking go.

6505
03:45:54,490 --> 03:45:55,690
Let's see who's gonna win.

6506
03:45:56,410 --> 03:45:57,610
Battle between brothers.

6507
03:45:57,650 --> 03:45:58,010
Battle between brothers.

6508
03:45:58,010 --> 03:45:59,770
Twin versus twin.

6509
03:46:00,030 --> 03:46:00,590
A battle.

6510
03:46:01,930 --> 03:46:03,310
A battle that began.

6511
03:46:03,430 --> 03:46:07,070
The following contest is a twins match!

6512
03:46:08,070 --> 03:46:11,250
For one fall, introducing first...

6513
03:46:11,810 --> 03:46:17,130
He is the bi-pedal gas pedal battle one!

6514
03:46:20,510 --> 03:46:21,470
That's horrifying.

6515
03:46:21,990 --> 03:46:22,810
It is.

6516
03:46:22,830 --> 03:46:23,470
What is his face?

6517
03:46:23,490 --> 03:46:24,770
I'm just looking at it in horror.

6518
03:46:24,970 --> 03:46:26,450
What the hell is that?

6519
03:46:26,450 --> 03:46:27,730
What is that?

6520
03:46:28,570 --> 03:46:33,210
His face is just plastered on human... on a human head.

6521
03:46:33,410 --> 03:46:34,690
What the hell?

6522
03:46:35,270 --> 03:46:37,850
Does he have like a skin suit?

6523
03:46:38,090 --> 03:46:40,610
That he's wearing over his head or face?

6524
03:46:40,750 --> 03:46:42,030
There's a fucking skinwalker.

6525
03:46:45,470 --> 03:46:53,910
Introducing his opponent, straight from the same room, the rebel who meddles...

6526
03:46:54,310 --> 03:46:55,330
Battle 2!

6527
03:46:57,110 --> 03:46:58,790
Wow, this is really nice!

6528
03:46:58,890 --> 03:47:01,470
A very unexpected turn of events.

6529
03:47:01,610 --> 03:47:05,670
I didn't think we'd be seeing battle 2 fight battle 1.

6530
03:47:05,950 --> 03:47:08,930
I thought it was like a joke at the beginning.

6531
03:47:09,150 --> 03:47:10,870
And turns out it's actually fucking real.

6532
03:47:10,870 --> 03:47:11,630
I thought it was literally just gonna be battle.

6533
03:47:12,110 --> 03:47:15,830
Yeah, it's like battle versus battle and his own character creation.

6534
03:47:16,110 --> 03:47:17,690
But look at this right now.

6535
03:47:17,770 --> 03:47:19,350
A surprising turn of events.

6536
03:47:20,230 --> 03:47:21,170
This is so weird.

6537
03:47:21,190 --> 03:47:23,950
This battle 2 looks more brash than the battle 1.

6538
03:47:25,390 --> 03:47:26,430
The winner should remember.

6539
03:47:26,430 --> 03:47:27,010
I'm gonna replace the battle.

6540
03:47:28,610 --> 03:47:28,970
Oh!

6541
03:47:29,930 --> 03:47:30,290
Oh!

6542
03:47:30,470 --> 03:47:31,350
Yeah, that should be a thing.

6543
03:47:31,450 --> 03:47:33,210
This is a battle to beat a battle.

6544
03:47:34,210 --> 03:47:35,470
Who's gonna beat a battle 1?

6545
03:47:37,110 --> 03:47:37,470
Oh!

6546
03:47:38,650 --> 03:47:39,010
Oh!

6547
03:47:40,950 --> 03:47:41,310
Sorry.

6548
03:47:44,330 --> 03:47:45,510
All bets on Tubert.

6549
03:47:45,610 --> 03:47:46,690
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

6550
03:47:46,790 --> 03:47:47,110
Thank you.

6551
03:47:47,230 --> 03:47:47,670
Thank you.

6552
03:47:51,790 --> 03:47:52,730
Okay, let's go.

6553
03:47:52,870 --> 03:47:53,230
Let's go.

6554
03:47:53,410 --> 03:47:53,750
All right.

6555
03:47:53,970 --> 03:47:54,690
All right!

6556
03:47:54,710 --> 03:47:55,190
I'm excited to see.

6557
03:47:55,430 --> 03:47:56,530
Here it is!

6558
03:47:56,530 --> 03:47:58,910
The battle of the century!

6559
03:47:59,370 --> 03:48:01,270
On this corner is battle.

6560
03:48:01,490 --> 03:48:04,490
And on that corner is battle 2!

6561
03:48:05,690 --> 03:48:06,230
Fight!

6562
03:48:06,410 --> 03:48:07,370
Oh my god!

6563
03:48:07,410 --> 03:48:08,810
They did the same thing!

6564
03:48:08,930 --> 03:48:10,290
They did the same thing!

6565
03:48:11,910 --> 03:48:13,230
Twins through and through!

6566
03:48:14,730 --> 03:48:16,230
Battle of the century and the king!

6567
03:48:16,430 --> 03:48:16,830
They share the same genetics.

6568
03:48:17,370 --> 03:48:19,530
Oh my god, this is hype as hell!

6569
03:48:19,910 --> 03:48:20,130
Oh!

6570
03:48:22,030 --> 03:48:24,570
Battle 1 turns out to be the battle 1.

6571
03:48:24,830 --> 03:48:26,230
And he's the way of summer soul!

6572
03:48:26,430 --> 03:48:26,510
Oh!

6573
03:48:26,510 --> 03:48:28,190
Oh, high flyer battle 1!

6574
03:48:28,690 --> 03:48:29,930
High flying technique.

6575
03:48:29,950 --> 03:48:30,490
With creepy ass face.

6576
03:48:32,250 --> 03:48:33,130
Right in the nuts.

6577
03:48:33,130 --> 03:48:34,210
Oh, right in the groin!

6578
03:48:35,510 --> 03:48:35,990
Ooh!

6579
03:48:37,890 --> 03:48:38,710
I can't...

6580
03:48:38,710 --> 03:48:39,370
This is the most...

6581
03:48:39,370 --> 03:48:41,690
I like that they started out sprinting towards each other.

6582
03:48:41,770 --> 03:48:41,990
...sturdiest hat in history.

6583
03:48:42,010 --> 03:48:45,170
Their immense hatred for each other is just that strong.

6584
03:48:45,390 --> 03:48:47,210
They immediately just started running!

6585
03:48:47,390 --> 03:48:48,310
They didn't even think!

6586
03:48:48,450 --> 03:48:50,630
They just did the same technique without even thinking!

6587
03:48:50,830 --> 03:48:51,790
That is insane.

6588
03:48:52,070 --> 03:48:52,490
That's...

6589
03:48:52,490 --> 03:48:53,910
That's what they did in the womb.

6590
03:48:54,870 --> 03:48:56,230
Who started kicking first?

6591
03:48:56,310 --> 03:48:56,490
Who started kicking first?

6592
03:48:56,510 --> 03:48:57,910
Battle or Bell 2?

6593
03:48:59,710 --> 03:49:00,470
Ask your mom.

6594
03:49:00,490 --> 03:49:01,110
You're at the same time.

6595
03:49:02,310 --> 03:49:03,590
Mom, who kicked first?

6596
03:49:04,430 --> 03:49:06,390
Oh, apparently, Battle 2 kicked first.

6597
03:49:06,470 --> 03:49:07,250
And whoa!

6598
03:49:07,470 --> 03:49:08,610
Battle mom, who do you love more?

6599
03:49:08,710 --> 03:49:09,270
Battle 1 or Bell 2?

6600
03:49:09,590 --> 03:49:10,610
Oh, shit!

6601
03:49:11,050 --> 03:49:12,010
Oh, god damn.

6602
03:49:13,170 --> 03:49:14,490
God damn, now they're outside.

6603
03:49:14,850 --> 03:49:15,830
A little bit of a hug.

6604
03:49:15,930 --> 03:49:17,610
A sweet family reunion moment.

6605
03:49:17,810 --> 03:49:19,490
And oh, oh, not really.

6606
03:49:19,610 --> 03:49:19,910
And oh!

6607
03:49:22,150 --> 03:49:25,650
They do not really love each other at this moment.

6608
03:49:25,650 --> 03:49:27,050
This is a hypas hail battle.

6609
03:49:27,530 --> 03:49:28,890
It is, it is.

6610
03:49:29,230 --> 03:49:32,290
Blood rivalry has always been like the hypas shit.

6611
03:49:32,350 --> 03:49:36,930
Like, who is the most dominant between like, um, siblings and shit.

6612
03:49:37,110 --> 03:49:38,370
They've always been compared.

6613
03:49:39,010 --> 03:49:39,990
That's so aggressive.

6614
03:49:41,410 --> 03:49:43,970
Aggressive and personal, considering they're brothers.

6615
03:49:44,050 --> 03:49:45,350
And a taunt!

6616
03:49:45,550 --> 03:49:45,870
Ooh!

6617
03:49:46,050 --> 03:49:47,270
That's a great taunt.

6618
03:49:49,890 --> 03:49:51,290
Going back into ring.

6619
03:49:51,370 --> 03:49:51,970
Giving him a chance.

6620
03:49:52,150 --> 03:49:52,510
Ooh!

6621
03:49:52,790 --> 03:49:54,150
Riding on that back... Ooh!

6622
03:49:55,230 --> 03:49:56,350
Smashed the face.

6623
03:49:57,310 --> 03:49:59,150
Kicking Tubert into the ground.

6624
03:49:59,450 --> 03:50:00,450
Pummeling him down.

6625
03:50:00,610 --> 03:50:01,550
Riding supreme.

6626
03:50:01,890 --> 03:50:03,190
Oh, he just jumped.

6627
03:50:03,330 --> 03:50:04,370
Went back inside.

6628
03:50:04,470 --> 03:50:05,290
What is this?

6629
03:50:05,290 --> 03:50:06,730
What is this clown behavior?

6630
03:50:07,110 --> 03:50:08,330
Back to your place.

6631
03:50:09,190 --> 03:50:10,370
Oh, Tubert.

6632
03:50:10,470 --> 03:50:11,150
Oh, oh!

6633
03:50:11,410 --> 03:50:12,130
Oh, you...

6634
03:50:15,570 --> 03:50:17,590
As expected of a...

6635
03:50:19,930 --> 03:50:21,730
That was a huge fumble.

6636
03:50:21,930 --> 03:50:23,430
But Willis fumbled though.

6637
03:50:23,510 --> 03:50:24,330
Oh, oh!

6638
03:50:24,330 --> 03:50:25,330
That's because he wears glasses.

6639
03:50:27,230 --> 03:50:27,930
A-Oi!

6640
03:50:29,790 --> 03:50:31,370
They both fumbled!

6641
03:50:31,530 --> 03:50:32,550
They're the same person.

6642
03:50:33,650 --> 03:50:35,410
I can't tell which one is which.

6643
03:50:39,350 --> 03:50:39,830
Oh!

6644
03:50:39,830 --> 03:50:41,750
Didn't even give him a chance to stand up.

6645
03:50:41,930 --> 03:50:42,590
The disrespect.

6646
03:50:43,230 --> 03:50:44,350
Leg locking him.

6647
03:50:45,010 --> 03:50:45,490
Ow!

6648
03:50:46,470 --> 03:50:46,950
Ow!

6649
03:50:47,250 --> 03:50:47,710
Ow!

6650
03:50:47,950 --> 03:50:48,430
Owie!

6651
03:50:48,510 --> 03:50:50,470
He's not gonna be standing up for a few seconds.

6652
03:50:50,910 --> 03:50:51,970
Oh, oh, oh!

6653
03:50:52,030 --> 03:50:52,270
Arm!

6654
03:50:52,470 --> 03:50:53,390
Arm, arm, arm!

6655
03:50:54,230 --> 03:50:54,630
Twisting!

6656
03:50:54,630 --> 03:50:54,810
Oh!

6657
03:50:56,010 --> 03:50:56,410
What?

6658
03:50:57,570 --> 03:50:59,570
And a taunt here and there.

6659
03:51:02,150 --> 03:51:03,850
Who do you think is gonna win, Octavio?

6660
03:51:03,950 --> 03:51:05,550
Based on the current fight right now.

6661
03:51:06,070 --> 03:51:07,490
I'm still rooting for Battle 1.

6662
03:51:08,150 --> 03:51:08,770
Battle 1?

6663
03:51:08,890 --> 03:51:10,690
Yeah, I kinda like changed my opinion.

6664
03:51:10,850 --> 03:51:14,230
Right now, I think Battle 2 is gonna make a a title change.

6665
03:51:14,470 --> 03:51:14,990
Right here.

6666
03:51:15,030 --> 03:51:16,350
Like a swift change of events.

6667
03:51:16,850 --> 03:51:17,190
Oh!

6668
03:51:17,190 --> 03:51:17,230
Oh!

6669
03:51:17,710 --> 03:51:18,150
Whoa!

6670
03:51:19,570 --> 03:51:20,550
Okay, take it back.

6671
03:51:20,630 --> 03:51:21,350
Take it back.

6672
03:51:21,570 --> 03:51:22,350
Oh, Battle's gonna win.

6673
03:51:22,510 --> 03:51:23,190
Battle's gonna win!

6674
03:51:23,310 --> 03:51:23,950
Is Battle gonna jump?

6675
03:51:24,090 --> 03:51:24,750
Battle's gonna jump!

6676
03:51:26,250 --> 03:51:26,690
Oh!

6677
03:51:26,690 --> 03:51:27,130
Damn!

6678
03:51:27,230 --> 03:51:27,670
Oh!

6679
03:51:27,670 --> 03:51:28,070
Censored!

6680
03:51:28,250 --> 03:51:29,270
Oh, god damn!

6681
03:51:29,350 --> 03:51:30,050
I can't see it.

6682
03:51:30,150 --> 03:51:32,410
Get your fucking sign off my screen!

6683
03:51:33,170 --> 03:51:34,590
Don't do this at home, kids.

6684
03:51:36,150 --> 03:51:36,590
Oh!

6685
03:51:36,590 --> 03:51:37,030
Clothesline!

6686
03:51:37,090 --> 03:51:39,370
That clothesline was really hard.

6687
03:51:40,270 --> 03:51:40,970
Oh, shit!

6688
03:51:41,150 --> 03:51:41,730
Oh, god.

6689
03:51:42,450 --> 03:51:42,890
Ayo!

6690
03:51:43,230 --> 03:51:43,670
Oh!

6691
03:51:45,850 --> 03:51:46,250
Oh!

6692
03:51:46,250 --> 03:51:47,210
Oh, he just walked away.

6693
03:51:47,470 --> 03:51:48,510
Not even worth running.

6694
03:51:48,510 --> 03:51:49,190
Not even...

6695
03:51:49,190 --> 03:51:49,190
This is so legally matched.

6696
03:51:50,070 --> 03:51:50,870
Oh, oh.

6697
03:51:50,910 --> 03:51:51,330
What are you doing?

6698
03:51:51,450 --> 03:51:52,430
In the size of Battle 2?

6699
03:51:53,170 --> 03:51:55,050
Oh, what the fuck are you doing, Battle 2?

6700
03:51:55,330 --> 03:51:56,050
Battle 2!

6701
03:51:58,750 --> 03:51:59,890
This is scripted.

6702
03:51:59,890 --> 03:52:00,310
That's so stupid.

6703
03:52:00,310 --> 03:52:02,610
Battle 2 loves Gavis Battle.

6704
03:52:03,370 --> 03:52:07,110
Tubert, I know you love your brother, but you don't have to fumble that, obviously, alright?

6705
03:52:07,450 --> 03:52:07,850
Alright?

6706
03:52:09,670 --> 03:52:11,250
He failed to land it!

6707
03:52:12,490 --> 03:52:13,790
Now we know who's gonna win!

6708
03:52:16,870 --> 03:52:17,270
Oh!

6709
03:52:17,430 --> 03:52:17,610
Oh!

6710
03:52:19,670 --> 03:52:22,870
They both jumped at the same time, but doing the pin is Tubert.

6711
03:52:22,950 --> 03:52:23,090
One!

6712
03:52:23,990 --> 03:52:25,070
And a count to one.

6713
03:52:25,070 --> 03:52:25,530
Just a one count.

6714
03:52:27,290 --> 03:52:29,470
Battle is more sturdy than I thought.

6715
03:52:30,350 --> 03:52:34,370
Yes, he is, but to be fair, they have not landed a finisher just yet.

6716
03:52:35,670 --> 03:52:36,590
And look at that!

6717
03:52:36,670 --> 03:52:36,990
Look at that!

6718
03:52:37,630 --> 03:52:38,030
Flexing!

6719
03:52:39,810 --> 03:52:40,770
And he's dead.

6720
03:52:41,010 --> 03:52:41,550
No, he's not.

6721
03:52:41,550 --> 03:52:43,670
His C3 is hurting.

6722
03:52:44,830 --> 03:52:45,270
Oh!

6723
03:52:45,630 --> 03:52:45,690
Oh!

6724
03:52:46,930 --> 03:52:47,630
Dirty move!

6725
03:52:47,750 --> 03:52:48,350
Dirty move!

6726
03:52:49,750 --> 03:52:50,590
That took him out.

6727
03:52:50,590 --> 03:52:53,870
I can't wait for Battle to show his signature move, the low blow.

6728
03:52:54,990 --> 03:52:56,710
Oh shit, that is the finisher.

6729
03:52:56,750 --> 03:52:57,070
Is this it?

6730
03:52:57,130 --> 03:52:57,630
Oh, that is it.

6731
03:52:57,670 --> 03:52:58,250
That might be it.

6732
03:52:59,190 --> 03:53:01,270
One, two, three!

6733
03:53:03,130 --> 03:53:04,010
Battle 1!

6734
03:53:04,130 --> 03:53:05,130
Battle 1 is the winner!

6735
03:53:05,210 --> 03:53:06,830
The battle of the battle!

6736
03:53:09,610 --> 03:53:11,010
Here is your winner!

6737
03:53:11,450 --> 03:53:12,650
Here is your winner!

6738
03:53:12,650 --> 03:53:12,790
Here is your winner!

6739
03:53:12,790 --> 03:53:13,170
Battle...

6740
03:53:14,930 --> 03:53:15,970
Only Winner!

6741
03:53:17,670 --> 03:53:18,190
Battle...

6742
03:53:18,190 --> 03:53:18,190
Only Winner!

6743
03:53:18,190 --> 03:53:19,050
Battle... Only Winner!

6744
03:53:20,230 --> 03:53:21,890
That was a nice fight though.

6745
03:53:21,970 --> 03:53:24,650
Even though it was short, that was like very hype as hell.

6746
03:53:25,990 --> 03:53:28,790
I hope they don't have any hard feelings though after this.

6747
03:53:28,930 --> 03:53:29,550
I hope they don't have any hard feelings though after this.

6748
03:53:29,550 --> 03:53:31,310
I hope nothing personal ever happens in between them.

6749
03:53:31,310 --> 03:53:31,330
We'll see.

6750
03:53:31,330 --> 03:53:31,410
We'll see.

6751
03:53:31,430 --> 03:53:32,990
Maybe who's gonna disown who.

6752
03:53:33,530 --> 03:53:34,250
Let's see.

6753
03:53:34,250 --> 03:53:34,730
Let's hear.

6754
03:53:35,430 --> 03:53:36,310
I don't know.

6755
03:53:37,150 --> 03:53:38,630
The plot twist continues.

6756
03:53:39,070 --> 03:53:40,710
He did not wiggle hard enough.

6757
03:53:44,310 --> 03:53:47,710
I may have been born second, but I just gave it first!

6758
03:53:49,030 --> 03:53:50,350
Woah, woah, woah!

6759
03:53:52,790 --> 03:53:53,750
Actual cannon!

6760
03:53:54,130 --> 03:53:54,630
Holy crap!

6761
03:53:54,810 --> 03:53:56,130
It is what it is, I guess, you know?

6762
03:53:56,250 --> 03:53:58,070
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

6763
03:53:58,450 --> 03:53:59,810
Today was my day, I guess.

6764
03:54:01,290 --> 03:54:01,770
Wow.

6765
03:54:01,890 --> 03:54:02,190
What?

6766
03:54:02,430 --> 03:54:02,690
Wow.

6767
03:54:03,010 --> 03:54:05,190
I feel kinda bad.

6768
03:54:06,330 --> 03:54:06,810
That's it?

6769
03:54:06,830 --> 03:54:07,850
I mean, it's alright.

6770
03:54:08,110 --> 03:54:09,110
Do you wanna talk about it?

6771
03:54:09,630 --> 03:54:10,930
No, no, it's alright.

6772
03:54:12,510 --> 03:54:16,010
I think I got caught up in the competitivity.

6773
03:54:16,090 --> 03:54:17,450
I didn't really check on your feelings.

6774
03:54:17,650 --> 03:54:18,870
No, no, I just thought that we would...

6775
03:54:18,870 --> 03:54:20,550
You know, it was a big day for us both here.

6776
03:54:20,710 --> 03:54:22,690
And I just thought we were gonna play it out a little bit more.

6777
03:54:23,050 --> 03:54:24,250
Yeah, I... well...

6778
03:54:25,250 --> 03:54:26,310
I... oh, jeez.

6779
03:54:26,490 --> 03:54:27,090
That really hurt.

6780
03:54:27,250 --> 03:54:28,630
Like, I don't know...

6781
03:54:29,430 --> 03:54:31,670
I thought we had agreed that it wasn't gonna...

6782
03:54:32,890 --> 03:54:34,610
We were gonna hold back just a little.

6783
03:54:34,710 --> 03:54:35,930
Alexa, play Despacito.

6784
03:54:36,450 --> 03:54:36,810
Alexa, play Despacito.

6785
03:54:36,830 --> 03:54:38,030
Please, chat.

6786
03:54:38,190 --> 03:54:40,450
Alright, play Despacito.

6787
03:54:40,610 --> 03:54:41,050
So sad.

6788
03:54:42,950 --> 03:54:44,390
Chat, this is revelation.

6789
03:54:46,710 --> 03:54:47,870
I... I... I won!

6790
03:54:48,170 --> 03:54:49,450
I won!

6791
03:54:49,770 --> 03:54:51,250
But I won a winner!

6792
03:54:52,490 --> 03:54:53,690
Lore drop?

6793
03:54:53,870 --> 03:54:54,850
Family lore drop?

6794
03:54:54,970 --> 03:54:55,470
Holy crap!

6795
03:54:55,770 --> 03:54:57,550
I could always find another brother.

6796
03:54:57,950 --> 03:54:58,370
Oh!

6797
03:55:01,890 --> 03:55:02,490
Well...

6798
03:55:02,490 --> 03:55:02,890
Damn.

6799
03:55:02,930 --> 03:55:03,810
You guys did amazing.

6800
03:55:03,810 --> 03:55:05,510
It was very... it was a very...

6801
03:55:05,510 --> 03:55:07,830
very even... even match?

6802
03:55:08,110 --> 03:55:09,050
Yeah, evenly matched.

6803
03:55:09,070 --> 03:55:09,410
Yeah.

6804
03:55:09,590 --> 03:55:10,170
Mm-hmm.

6805
03:55:10,970 --> 03:55:12,770
Literally and metaphorically.

6806
03:55:13,370 --> 03:55:13,890
Mm-hmm.

6807
03:55:13,890 --> 03:55:16,770
Yeah, it only relied on the person who would do the finisher first.

6808
03:55:16,850 --> 03:55:17,190
And...

6809
03:55:17,190 --> 03:55:17,790
Yeah.

6810
03:55:17,890 --> 03:55:18,270
Yeah.

6811
03:55:19,270 --> 03:55:22,570
I was really surprised when you both did the same move at the beginning.

6812
03:55:22,570 --> 03:55:23,230
That was sick.

6813
03:55:23,870 --> 03:55:24,790
Yeah, that was...

6814
03:55:24,790 --> 03:55:26,650
I didn't think you'd be doing the same moves!

6815
03:55:26,850 --> 03:55:28,270
Was that planned or was it not?

6816
03:55:28,370 --> 03:55:29,510
Like, let's talk about this.

6817
03:55:29,530 --> 03:55:30,390
Let's use the same technique.

6818
03:55:30,390 --> 03:55:32,430
I mean, I mean, you know, we're twins.

6819
03:55:32,590 --> 03:55:33,430
We're thinking the same thing.

6820
03:55:33,470 --> 03:55:35,530
We had a psychological advantage on each other.

6821
03:55:35,890 --> 03:55:36,290
Yeah.

6822
03:55:36,390 --> 03:55:37,090
Oh, shit.

6823
03:55:37,310 --> 03:55:39,110
Yeah, it's twin things, I guess.

6824
03:55:39,470 --> 03:55:42,130
But what we can't take away is that the winner is Betel.

6825
03:55:43,230 --> 03:55:45,870
And that you should be careful what you drink from now on.

6826
03:55:45,930 --> 03:55:45,990
And the Betel one.

6827
03:55:46,570 --> 03:55:47,290
Very true.

6828
03:55:48,050 --> 03:55:49,890
Betel is the winner, everybody!

6829
03:55:50,170 --> 03:55:50,490
Everybody!

6830
03:55:51,330 --> 03:55:53,110
Congratulations to Betel!

6831
03:55:53,350 --> 03:55:53,610
Yeah!

6832
03:55:54,510 --> 03:55:54,910
Congratulations!

6833
03:55:55,430 --> 03:55:56,150
Thank you.

6834
03:55:56,510 --> 03:55:57,130
Thank you.

6835
03:55:57,130 --> 03:55:59,970
Alright, well, I'm gonna go get some rest.

6836
03:56:00,090 --> 03:56:02,490
And Betel too, thanks for fighting me.

6837
03:56:02,870 --> 03:56:03,610
Yeah, it was fun.

6838
03:56:04,790 --> 03:56:08,190
Yeah, it was both entertaining and fun having both of you here.

6839
03:56:08,330 --> 03:56:09,650
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6840
03:56:10,270 --> 03:56:11,650
Alright, well, thanks for having us.

6841
03:56:11,650 --> 03:56:12,890
See you in the next fight, Betel.

6842
03:56:13,530 --> 03:56:14,030
Alright!

6843
03:56:14,470 --> 03:56:15,130
Bye-bye!

6844
03:56:15,230 --> 03:56:15,850
Thank you!

6845
03:56:17,670 --> 03:56:20,190
And next, we have the next...

6846
03:56:20,190 --> 03:56:21,170
It's Dokian.

6847
03:56:21,390 --> 03:56:23,010
And here it is, everybody!

6848
03:56:23,490 --> 03:56:25,770
The moment you've been waiting for!

6849
03:56:26,450 --> 03:56:26,950
Here it is.

6850
03:56:26,950 --> 03:56:27,110
The moment you've been waiting for!

6851
03:56:27,830 --> 03:56:28,350
Axel!

6852
03:56:30,050 --> 03:56:31,090
Versus Dokian!

6853
03:56:32,470 --> 03:56:32,990
What is this?

6854
03:56:32,990 --> 03:56:33,450
What is this?

6855
03:56:35,070 --> 03:56:36,450
It's cute though, it's cute.

6856
03:56:36,530 --> 03:56:37,490
That's Axel-senpai!

6857
03:56:38,030 --> 03:56:38,470
Stop!

6858
03:56:39,770 --> 03:56:41,130
What the fuck?

6859
03:56:42,910 --> 03:56:43,870
What the fuck?

6860
03:56:43,870 --> 03:56:44,650
Why are you so small?

6861
03:56:44,650 --> 03:56:48,150
We postponed you like four times, Axel!

6862
03:56:48,470 --> 03:56:48,990
We postponed you like four times, Axel!

6863
03:56:48,990 --> 03:56:50,530
Yeah, yo, okay.

6864
03:56:50,910 --> 03:56:54,010
First of all, let me say, hey, nice to meet you, man.

6865
03:56:54,070 --> 03:56:54,290
Hey, nice to meet you, man.

6866
03:56:54,290 --> 03:56:56,290
It doesn't feel like our first time talking.

6867
03:56:58,610 --> 03:57:00,010
We've just met, you know?

6868
03:57:00,070 --> 03:57:01,670
I feel like I've heard this thing before.

6869
03:57:02,850 --> 03:57:04,610
Yeah, I just don't know.

6870
03:57:04,750 --> 03:57:07,370
It's somewhere in my memory.

6871
03:57:07,450 --> 03:57:11,170
This guy hasn't even digested his fucking chicken yet and he's here to fight me?

6872
03:57:11,570 --> 03:57:11,970
This guy hasn't even digested his fucking chicken yet and he's here to fight me?

6873
03:57:11,970 --> 03:57:12,770
Oh, it's a pregame!

6874
03:57:13,050 --> 03:57:14,530
It's a pregame meal, alright?

6875
03:57:14,530 --> 03:57:15,470
What do you mean pregame?

6876
03:57:15,650 --> 03:57:18,190
It's like when you eat and you're not supposed to go to the swimming pool.

6877
03:57:18,470 --> 03:57:20,070
You're not supposed to wrestle after eating.

6878
03:57:21,250 --> 03:57:22,950
This guy doesn't take this seriously.

6879
03:57:23,530 --> 03:57:24,650
Nah, this is a series, dude.

6880
03:57:24,650 --> 03:57:26,010
I gotta win after this.

6881
03:57:26,070 --> 03:57:29,870
I know half of the boys out there fucking got slaughtered, bro.

6882
03:57:30,070 --> 03:57:31,870
Yeah, we did.

6883
03:57:32,590 --> 03:57:36,410
All my disciples, all my sons, they all got fucking slaughtered.

6884
03:57:36,410 --> 03:57:37,590
Except for like one or two, you know?

6885
03:57:38,250 --> 03:57:42,350
Now, as the sensei, I gotta come out and win for them.

6886
03:57:43,030 --> 03:57:43,930
You know what I'm saying?

6887
03:57:43,970 --> 03:57:44,670
You better, senpai.

6888
03:57:44,870 --> 03:57:45,810
I'm rooting for you, buddy!

6889
03:57:46,350 --> 03:57:47,350
Hell yeah, baby.

6890
03:57:47,490 --> 03:57:53,290
I gotta fucking channel my inner Steve Irwin and fucking tackle you down like a little fucking crocodile.

6891
03:57:53,290 --> 03:57:55,490
He fucking died to a stingray.

6892
03:57:56,510 --> 03:57:59,110
I just had to poke you in the fucking heart.

6893
03:57:59,310 --> 03:57:59,690
Like, what did you do?

6894
03:57:59,690 --> 03:58:01,790
Bro, motherfucker, you don't look like a stingray.

6895
03:58:01,850 --> 03:58:04,110
I could just fucking punch you in the heart and you're fucked.

6896
03:58:04,270 --> 03:58:04,890
He's dead.

6897
03:58:04,970 --> 03:58:07,430
You look like the chicken I had at Nando's.

6898
03:58:07,430 --> 03:58:08,990
Aw, shut your big ass up.

6899
03:58:09,070 --> 03:58:09,850
Bring your ass.

6900
03:58:10,170 --> 03:58:12,410
You look like the chicken I had at Nando's today.

6901
03:58:12,750 --> 03:58:13,190
Wow!

6902
03:58:14,670 --> 03:58:15,690
Damn fucking right.

6903
03:58:15,690 --> 03:58:17,990
I hope you get a stomachache from that.

6904
03:58:18,390 --> 03:58:20,470
Because you didn't digest it properly.

6905
03:58:20,930 --> 03:58:21,210
Oh, Nala.

6906
03:58:21,210 --> 03:58:22,790
I eat raw meat all the time, baby.

6907
03:58:23,290 --> 03:58:26,850
I hope you get a kidney stone from that Nando.

6908
03:58:27,370 --> 03:58:29,190
Nah, I'm drinking water every day.

6909
03:58:29,190 --> 03:58:30,330
Why am I getting hit?

6910
03:58:30,390 --> 03:58:32,990
Why specifically kidney stones?

6911
03:58:33,350 --> 03:58:35,090
I'm a fucking hydro homie.

6912
03:58:35,130 --> 03:58:37,150
I drink water every day nonstop.

6913
03:58:37,290 --> 03:58:37,610
You know?

6914
03:58:39,490 --> 03:58:41,010
Alcohol's not water.

6915
03:58:43,510 --> 03:58:44,230
Well...

6916
03:58:45,290 --> 03:58:46,010
Well...

6917
03:58:46,950 --> 03:58:47,310
Nah.

6918
03:58:49,370 --> 03:58:50,810
I saw...

6919
03:58:50,810 --> 03:58:53,930
I saw what you're wearing tonight in the ring.

6920
03:58:54,270 --> 03:58:55,490
You're going down.

6921
03:58:55,950 --> 03:58:56,950
Check out my fit.

6922
03:58:57,070 --> 03:58:57,810
I got it from Gucci.

6923
03:58:57,970 --> 03:58:58,770
Straight out of Gucci.

6924
03:58:58,910 --> 03:58:59,350
Oh yeah?

6925
03:58:59,530 --> 03:59:01,870
They're gonna see what you got from Gucci.

6926
03:59:02,530 --> 03:59:03,130
Hell yeah.

6927
03:59:03,710 --> 03:59:04,190
Bro.

6928
03:59:04,650 --> 03:59:06,030
I didn't even buy it.

6929
03:59:06,110 --> 03:59:07,290
They just gave it to me for free.

6930
03:59:07,350 --> 03:59:09,570
They're like, yo, sponsored by us.

6931
03:59:09,590 --> 03:59:10,110
Oh no.

6932
03:59:10,150 --> 03:59:11,450
When they see...

6933
03:59:11,450 --> 03:59:16,930
When all of them see what they gave you for free, they'll know why it was for free.

6934
03:59:17,390 --> 03:59:18,190
I mean, hey.

6935
03:59:18,190 --> 03:59:19,710
Look at my pose, yo.

6936
03:59:19,870 --> 03:59:23,250
I'm giving you that zesty little meow-looking ass pose, bro.

6937
03:59:23,330 --> 03:59:25,170
I'm out here for some zest tonight.

6938
03:59:25,390 --> 03:59:28,890
And I'm gonna get yo ass just like the chicken I had at Nando's like I said.

6939
03:59:29,710 --> 03:59:30,630
Bring your ass.

6940
03:59:30,910 --> 03:59:34,370
Just like the stingray to Steve Irwin, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

6941
03:59:34,470 --> 03:59:34,850
In game.

6942
03:59:35,730 --> 03:59:36,590
Oh, oh, oh.

6943
03:59:38,090 --> 03:59:38,530
Ayo.

6944
03:59:38,530 --> 03:59:39,150
In game.

6945
03:59:39,290 --> 03:59:39,570
In game.

6946
03:59:39,870 --> 03:59:40,310
In game.

6947
03:59:40,490 --> 03:59:41,030
In game.

6948
03:59:41,050 --> 03:59:41,470
In game.

6949
03:59:41,990 --> 03:59:42,210
In game.

6950
03:59:42,330 --> 03:59:43,570
Thank you for the clarification.

6951
03:59:44,510 --> 03:59:48,110
But let's see the statistics on the poll right here.

6952
03:59:48,190 --> 03:59:56,470
And the overwhelming majority thinks that Doki's gonna win by 65%, over 35%.

6953
03:59:56,470 --> 03:59:57,910
But we will see, everybody.

6954
03:59:58,230 --> 04:00:00,130
They don't believe the underdog story.

6955
04:00:00,430 --> 04:00:01,250
You know what I'm saying?

6956
04:00:01,470 --> 04:00:03,130
The underdog story lives through.

6957
04:00:03,510 --> 04:00:05,390
Look at the rain.

6958
04:00:05,610 --> 04:00:07,210
Bro, bro, I'm just saying.

6959
04:00:07,430 --> 04:00:08,270
Dude, dude, dude.

6960
04:00:08,270 --> 04:00:09,210
Bet for me.

6961
04:00:09,930 --> 04:00:11,070
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

6962
04:00:11,250 --> 04:00:14,170
Bet for me and you make that money.

6963
04:00:14,770 --> 04:00:16,090
Shout out to Kabusu.

6964
04:00:16,410 --> 04:00:16,650
Oh.

6965
04:00:18,190 --> 04:00:19,110
What the fuck?

6966
04:00:20,390 --> 04:00:21,850
Aww, that's so cute.

6967
04:00:22,830 --> 04:00:23,990
That's so cute.

6968
04:00:24,390 --> 04:00:25,610
Aww, that's so cute.

6969
04:00:25,610 --> 04:00:26,830
I didn't think you could do that.

6970
04:00:26,830 --> 04:00:27,110
Oh my god.

6971
04:00:27,130 --> 04:00:27,410
Damn, Doki in the house.

6972
04:00:27,430 --> 04:00:28,310
We got Axel here.

6973
04:00:28,590 --> 04:00:30,230
Everybody change the statistics now.

6974
04:00:30,310 --> 04:00:31,010
Vote for Axel.

6975
04:00:31,170 --> 04:00:32,390
Continuation of Tekken 8.

6976
04:00:33,810 --> 04:00:34,290
This is a cute image.

6977
04:00:34,810 --> 04:00:35,550
But yeah.

6978
04:00:35,710 --> 04:00:37,130
Let us now continue.

6979
04:00:38,390 --> 04:00:41,390
Doki versus Axel Sirius.

6980
04:00:41,390 --> 04:00:43,010
Axel Sirius, dog.

6981
04:00:44,570 --> 04:00:45,410
Let's see his fit.

6982
04:00:45,410 --> 04:00:46,870
He says it comes from Gucci.

6983
04:00:47,510 --> 04:00:48,570
We'll see about that.

6984
04:00:48,630 --> 04:00:48,710
It is.

6985
04:00:48,910 --> 04:00:50,070
Let's see, let's see.

6986
04:00:53,810 --> 04:00:55,110
Damn, this is hype.

6987
04:00:55,970 --> 04:00:57,650
Yeah, the loading screen is intense.

6988
04:00:59,830 --> 04:01:03,870
The following contest is scheduled for One Fall.

6989
04:01:06,670 --> 04:01:07,670
What's a One Fall?

6990
04:01:09,090 --> 04:01:12,570
She is the Ayatollah of the Tuberola.

6991
04:01:12,570 --> 04:01:17,010
Her heart makes us go Doki Doki.

6992
04:01:17,190 --> 04:01:21,290
She is the word Doki.

6993
04:01:24,290 --> 04:01:24,720
BAM!

6994
04:01:28,050 --> 04:01:29,950
And here she is.

6995
04:01:30,130 --> 04:01:30,350
That's so good.

6996
04:01:30,650 --> 04:01:33,210
Rising ever so slowly.

6997
04:01:33,290 --> 04:01:34,090
Very dramatic.

6998
04:01:34,410 --> 04:01:36,150
And she is the king.

6999
04:01:36,170 --> 04:01:37,390
Look at that flat tiger face.

7000
04:01:37,930 --> 04:01:39,730
That very flat.

7001
04:01:41,090 --> 04:01:43,310
Poorly rendered tiger face.

7002
04:01:43,630 --> 04:01:44,970
You can't see the snow.

7003
04:01:44,990 --> 04:01:46,950
I can't.

7004
04:01:47,670 --> 04:01:51,030
But god damn, that is very intimidating and terrifying.

7005
04:01:51,430 --> 04:01:54,170
Looks like someone will fucking rob me in the fucking middle of the night.

7006
04:01:54,310 --> 04:01:55,230
Jesus Christ.

7007
04:01:57,490 --> 04:01:58,050
Woo.

7008
04:01:58,830 --> 04:01:59,650
Nothing special.

7009
04:02:00,190 --> 04:02:01,510
And there it is!

7010
04:02:01,690 --> 04:02:03,670
There it is!

7011
04:02:04,510 --> 04:02:05,070
Pyro.

7012
04:02:05,410 --> 04:02:07,570
The pyro.

7013
04:02:08,830 --> 04:02:09,910
Look at those muscles.

7014
04:02:10,430 --> 04:02:11,350
No roaring.

7015
04:02:12,670 --> 04:02:14,110
Oh shit, I know that.

7016
04:02:14,170 --> 04:02:14,850
It's Cody Rhodes.

7017
04:02:14,990 --> 04:02:15,790
Cody Rhodes!

7018
04:02:17,450 --> 04:02:18,650
Cody Rhodes entrance.

7019
04:02:23,350 --> 04:02:23,790
Woo!

7020
04:02:25,530 --> 04:02:26,610
Very fucking nice.

7021
04:02:26,670 --> 04:02:27,150
They are crazy on that.

7022
04:02:27,730 --> 04:02:31,730
He is physically and mentally prepared for the task at hand in his big time match.

7023
04:02:31,750 --> 04:02:33,050
He is physically and mentally prepared for the task at hand in his big time match.

7024
04:02:33,190 --> 04:02:33,370
He is physically and mentally prepared for the task at hand in his big time match.

7025
04:02:33,710 --> 04:02:34,910
The hype is immense.

7026
04:02:35,110 --> 04:02:35,970
I can't wait.

7027
04:02:36,170 --> 04:02:37,370
Who is your bet?

7028
04:02:38,550 --> 04:02:40,930
I think I am going to bet on Doki for this one.

7029
04:02:41,270 --> 04:02:44,410
I am going to bet on Axel just because he is my senpai.

7030
04:02:44,590 --> 04:02:45,630
I am going to vote.

7031
04:02:46,250 --> 04:02:47,130
I can't.

7032
04:02:47,610 --> 04:02:48,170
I can't.

7033
04:02:48,170 --> 04:02:49,130
It's one of the rules.

7034
04:02:49,350 --> 04:02:51,310
Introducing her opponent.

7035
04:02:53,410 --> 04:02:55,810
The Zest in the world.

7036
04:02:56,810 --> 04:02:58,450
Oh my god.

7037
04:02:59,490 --> 04:03:00,930
Actually serious.

7038
04:03:03,150 --> 04:03:04,590
Axel Seria!

7039
04:03:05,710 --> 04:03:06,470
Axel Seria!

7040
04:03:06,470 --> 04:03:06,990
Axel Seria!

7041
04:03:06,990 --> 04:03:07,750
Oh wow!

7042
04:03:08,670 --> 04:03:10,130
What the heck guys.

7043
04:03:10,150 --> 04:03:10,870
He brought out the bomb stick.

7044
04:03:13,210 --> 04:03:15,050
Dude that is so cute.

7045
04:03:15,710 --> 04:03:16,730
That's not Gucci.

7046
04:03:16,890 --> 04:03:17,350
That's Coochie.

7047
04:03:18,430 --> 04:03:19,850
What the fuck are you talking about?

7048
04:03:20,010 --> 04:03:21,050
That's not what it means.

7049
04:03:21,410 --> 04:03:21,850
Stop!

7050
04:03:22,030 --> 04:03:23,550
Where the fuck is the Coochie part?

7051
04:03:24,130 --> 04:03:24,570
Octavio!

7052
04:03:27,450 --> 04:03:27,890
Damn.

7053
04:03:28,410 --> 04:03:29,330
You are not helping.

7054
04:03:32,290 --> 04:03:34,550
This stream is so demonetized because of you.

7055
04:03:34,670 --> 04:03:35,270
Very confirmed.

7056
04:03:40,770 --> 04:03:41,450
But hey.

7057
04:03:41,630 --> 04:03:42,970
He has that dog in him though.

7058
04:03:43,150 --> 04:03:45,950
It has Axel's hair on the dog.

7059
04:03:46,090 --> 04:03:46,390
Yeah.

7060
04:03:47,610 --> 04:03:49,090
It's like poorly textured but it's there.

7061
04:03:50,490 --> 04:03:51,050
Damn.

7062
04:03:51,150 --> 04:03:51,950
He even got the chains.

7063
04:03:54,430 --> 04:03:55,510
Like Kurapika.

7064
04:03:57,970 --> 04:03:58,530
Alright.

7065
04:03:58,610 --> 04:03:59,010
Let's go.

7066
04:03:59,210 --> 04:04:00,930
Battle between furries.

7067
04:04:00,930 --> 04:04:02,330
Who's gonna win?

7068
04:04:02,730 --> 04:04:05,270
The king or Doach.

7069
04:04:06,950 --> 04:04:09,810
An immediate beat down from Doachie.

7070
04:04:10,470 --> 04:04:11,590
Pummeling his face.

7071
04:04:13,930 --> 04:04:14,490
Pummeling his face.

7072
04:04:14,530 --> 04:04:14,810
Running.

7073
04:04:15,030 --> 04:04:16,390
Yeah this is a furry battle.

7074
04:04:16,390 --> 04:04:17,310
Battle the furries.

7075
04:04:17,310 --> 04:04:18,210
It is.

7076
04:04:18,450 --> 04:04:18,970
Technically.

7077
04:04:20,850 --> 04:04:21,610
Oh wow.

7078
04:04:22,430 --> 04:04:24,270
I'm just looking at Axel's clothes.

7079
04:04:24,990 --> 04:04:25,510
Woah.

7080
04:04:25,710 --> 04:04:27,670
It looks like a fucking dog bro.

7081
04:04:28,870 --> 04:04:29,390
Yeah.

7082
04:04:30,930 --> 04:04:32,750
Those back muscles are crazy.

7083
04:04:33,250 --> 04:04:33,770
It's so cute.

7084
04:04:33,770 --> 04:04:34,290
It is though.

7085
04:04:34,610 --> 04:04:36,610
Like isn't that just a suit though?

7086
04:04:36,890 --> 04:04:37,890
Yeah it's just a suit.

7087
04:04:38,270 --> 04:04:39,650
It's just a muscle suit.

7088
04:04:39,730 --> 04:04:40,570
It's not even real.

7089
04:04:40,890 --> 04:04:41,410
It's really thin inside.

7090
04:04:43,870 --> 04:04:44,470
Rubbing it.

7091
04:04:44,570 --> 04:04:45,530
Rubbing her face.

7092
04:04:46,150 --> 04:04:46,630
Oh.

7093
04:04:46,930 --> 04:04:48,430
Stun meter is up.

7094
04:04:49,010 --> 04:04:50,010
Elbow to the back.

7095
04:04:51,010 --> 04:04:52,570
Is this gonna be a quick match?

7096
04:04:53,650 --> 04:04:55,170
Slamming the face.

7097
04:04:55,790 --> 04:04:56,830
The back of the head to the stage.

7098
04:04:56,830 --> 04:04:58,290
Axel's stereo is like a mad dog.

7099
04:05:00,670 --> 04:05:01,150
Oh.

7100
04:05:02,690 --> 04:05:04,230
Almost stunned here everybody.

7101
04:05:04,690 --> 04:05:06,090
What is that taunt?

7102
04:05:06,430 --> 04:05:06,910
Oh.

7103
04:05:08,650 --> 04:05:09,690
Doachie better get up.

7104
04:05:10,430 --> 04:05:10,910
Oh.

7105
04:05:11,030 --> 04:05:11,430
Counter.

7106
04:05:12,150 --> 04:05:12,630
Counter.

7107
04:05:12,730 --> 04:05:14,090
The stun meter is going away.

7108
04:05:14,150 --> 04:05:15,450
He just stepped on him.

7109
04:05:16,730 --> 04:05:17,470
Okay here we go.

7110
04:05:17,990 --> 04:05:18,830
Doachie's really tall.

7111
04:05:18,950 --> 04:05:19,210
Here we go.

7112
04:05:19,310 --> 04:05:19,610
Here we go.

7113
04:05:21,670 --> 04:05:22,030
Ow.

7114
04:05:22,030 --> 04:05:22,710
Just got hurt.

7115
04:05:23,370 --> 04:05:24,370
Bunch of chains on there too.

7116
04:05:24,870 --> 04:05:25,590
Oh shit.

7117
04:05:26,010 --> 04:05:26,710
Knee to the face.

7118
04:05:26,890 --> 04:05:28,070
Even landed on it.

7119
04:05:28,090 --> 04:05:28,490
My goodness.

7120
04:05:28,570 --> 04:05:29,170
That body weight.

7121
04:05:30,510 --> 04:05:34,010
They're both dishing each other's attacks on the fucking face.

7122
04:05:38,270 --> 04:05:39,350
They're grabbing each other.

7123
04:05:39,650 --> 04:05:40,350
Oh no.

7124
04:05:41,490 --> 04:05:41,850
Countered.

7125
04:05:43,170 --> 04:05:43,530
Oh.

7126
04:05:43,970 --> 04:05:45,570
Technically a hit but a miss.

7127
04:05:45,950 --> 04:05:46,950
Can he do it here?

7128
04:05:48,550 --> 04:05:49,670
Will it be enough?

7129
04:05:49,810 --> 04:05:50,690
Hold onto the rope.

7130
04:05:50,730 --> 04:05:51,370
Hold onto the rope.

7131
04:05:52,150 --> 04:05:53,290
Okay it wasn't enough.

7132
04:05:55,330 --> 04:05:55,770
Hit.

7133
04:05:55,870 --> 04:05:56,090
Hit.

7134
04:05:56,190 --> 04:05:56,590
Hit.

7135
04:05:56,650 --> 04:05:56,930
Hit.

7136
04:05:56,950 --> 04:05:57,150
Hit.

7137
04:05:57,650 --> 04:05:58,090
Oh.

7138
04:05:58,590 --> 04:05:59,030
Oh.

7139
04:05:59,130 --> 04:05:59,570
Oh.

7140
04:06:00,270 --> 04:06:01,630
Throw into the ringside.

7141
04:06:01,650 --> 04:06:03,170
And knee to the face.

7142
04:06:03,170 --> 04:06:03,570
What is that?

7143
04:06:04,170 --> 04:06:05,310
Oh my god.

7144
04:06:06,670 --> 04:06:08,250
A quick leverage out of the way.

7145
04:06:08,330 --> 04:06:08,910
Doachie instantly recovered for that.

7146
04:06:08,990 --> 04:06:09,090
Wow.

7147
04:06:11,470 --> 04:06:12,770
Both heavy hitters.

7148
04:06:12,770 --> 04:06:13,430
Oh this is gonna hurt.

7149
04:06:13,530 --> 04:06:14,070
This is gonna hurt.

7150
04:06:14,210 --> 04:06:14,790
Carrying it.

7151
04:06:14,790 --> 04:06:14,990
Oh.

7152
04:06:16,630 --> 04:06:17,070
On the railing.

7153
04:06:17,070 --> 04:06:17,190
On the railing.

7154
04:06:17,190 --> 04:06:17,550
Is that allowed?

7155
04:06:18,270 --> 04:06:18,710
Disqualification.

7156
04:06:18,710 --> 04:06:19,690
You're using...

7157
04:06:20,790 --> 04:06:22,930
That should be disqualification right?

7158
04:06:23,050 --> 04:06:23,730
Or am I wrong?

7159
04:06:25,950 --> 04:06:26,550
My god.

7160
04:06:26,610 --> 04:06:27,770
They just left him out there.

7161
04:06:28,430 --> 04:06:29,110
And jumped.

7162
04:06:29,170 --> 04:06:29,610
Oh.

7163
04:06:33,690 --> 04:06:34,570
Fucking spear.

7164
04:06:35,150 --> 04:06:35,590
Launching.

7165
04:06:36,310 --> 04:06:36,750
Oh.

7166
04:06:38,370 --> 04:06:39,190
That's gotta hurt.

7167
04:06:39,350 --> 04:06:40,430
Pina walks out.

7168
04:06:40,690 --> 04:06:41,550
Animal abuse.

7169
04:06:41,830 --> 04:06:42,550
That's pure cement.

7170
04:06:43,470 --> 04:06:43,910
Oh.

7171
04:06:45,250 --> 04:06:46,970
Could you guys please stop?

7172
04:06:47,190 --> 04:06:47,210
Not the railing.

7173
04:06:48,070 --> 04:06:49,010
Not the metal.

7174
04:06:49,090 --> 04:06:50,010
Oh my god.

7175
04:06:50,050 --> 04:06:50,950
That is personal.

7176
04:06:51,250 --> 04:06:51,610
Oh wow.

7177
04:06:53,290 --> 04:06:54,870
This feels like old wrestling.

7178
04:06:55,230 --> 04:06:56,370
The beautiful face.

7179
04:06:57,390 --> 04:06:59,310
And he tosses him back in now.

7180
04:06:59,470 --> 04:06:59,810
Okay.

7181
04:06:59,850 --> 04:07:00,010
Okay.

7182
04:07:00,090 --> 04:07:01,230
The old days of wrestling.

7183
04:07:01,630 --> 04:07:03,350
This might be it.

7184
04:07:03,390 --> 04:07:03,590
Oh.

7185
04:07:03,650 --> 04:07:04,390
Was an attack.

7186
04:07:04,610 --> 04:07:05,430
Oh what the fuck.

7187
04:07:06,210 --> 04:07:07,570
Axel doing a taunt.

7188
04:07:07,730 --> 04:07:08,630
Is it worth it?

7189
04:07:08,650 --> 04:07:08,770
One of the moves.

7190
04:07:09,350 --> 04:07:11,350
You could have used that time to actually... Oh.

7191
04:07:11,550 --> 04:07:12,390
Grinding the face.

7192
04:07:13,630 --> 04:07:15,190
And an elbow drop too.

7193
04:07:16,730 --> 04:07:18,650
Don't do that to the jaguar face.

7194
04:07:19,010 --> 04:07:19,310
Doki.

7195
04:07:19,490 --> 04:07:20,190
Can you survive?

7196
04:07:20,310 --> 04:07:20,610
One.

7197
04:07:20,910 --> 04:07:21,350
Two.

7198
04:07:21,710 --> 04:07:21,770
Two.

7199
04:07:22,310 --> 04:07:23,050
Kick out.

7200
04:07:23,210 --> 04:07:23,470
Almost.

7201
04:07:23,470 --> 04:07:23,750
Almost.

7202
04:07:24,070 --> 04:07:25,710
Come on man.

7203
04:07:25,730 --> 04:07:26,090
Not quite.

7204
04:07:26,090 --> 04:07:27,450
You're voting for Doki right?

7205
04:07:27,690 --> 04:07:28,810
You bet your own man.

7206
04:07:29,690 --> 04:07:30,270
We'll see.

7207
04:07:30,410 --> 04:07:30,810
Axel go.

7208
04:07:31,090 --> 04:07:33,110
That's a professionalism in an attack like that.

7209
04:07:33,110 --> 04:07:34,170
Doki still has a chance.

7210
04:07:34,430 --> 04:07:34,870
Oh.

7211
04:07:35,930 --> 04:07:36,990
Was that the balls?

7212
04:07:37,050 --> 04:07:37,910
I have no idea.

7213
04:07:38,770 --> 04:07:39,210
Oh.

7214
04:07:39,350 --> 04:07:39,710
Hamstrings.

7215
04:07:39,810 --> 04:07:40,050
Okay.

7216
04:07:40,130 --> 04:07:41,050
I thought they were the balls.

7217
04:07:41,110 --> 04:07:41,330
Okay.

7218
04:07:42,090 --> 04:07:42,530
Okay.

7219
04:07:42,770 --> 04:07:43,370
Oh.

7220
04:07:43,470 --> 04:07:43,910
Oh.

7221
04:07:44,050 --> 04:07:44,650
A spear.

7222
04:07:46,270 --> 04:07:46,710
Ah.

7223
04:07:47,510 --> 04:07:50,590
This is technically one sided as it is.

7224
04:07:52,050 --> 04:07:52,750
I don't know.

7225
04:07:52,850 --> 04:07:53,070
Look.

7226
04:07:53,070 --> 04:07:53,210
Look.

7227
04:07:53,630 --> 04:07:56,770
She still has a fight in her.

7228
04:07:56,850 --> 04:07:57,050
Look.

7229
04:07:58,290 --> 04:07:58,730
Look.

7230
04:07:58,810 --> 04:07:59,350
There we go.

7231
04:07:59,890 --> 04:08:00,330
Oh.

7232
04:08:00,850 --> 04:08:01,250
Rage art.

7233
04:08:01,650 --> 04:08:02,330
Rage art.

7234
04:08:02,450 --> 04:08:03,310
Rage art.

7235
04:08:05,250 --> 04:08:06,130
Oh my god.

7236
04:08:06,170 --> 04:08:07,430
Stun meter is back up baby.

7237
04:08:07,790 --> 04:08:09,130
Back to the railing again.

7238
04:08:09,130 --> 04:08:11,350
You have to continue the pummel.

7239
04:08:11,370 --> 04:08:13,510
Pummeling will actually stun Axel.

7240
04:08:13,630 --> 04:08:14,130
If this continues.

7241
04:08:14,330 --> 04:08:14,770
And.

7242
04:08:14,910 --> 04:08:15,330
Oh.

7243
04:08:15,430 --> 04:08:16,850
Nothing happened.

7244
04:08:17,050 --> 04:08:17,670
What the fuck.

7245
04:08:17,770 --> 04:08:19,490
And Axel gained advantage again.

7246
04:08:20,650 --> 04:08:22,230
The game bugged.

7247
04:08:22,230 --> 04:08:24,810
Before she could even fight back.

7248
04:08:24,870 --> 04:08:25,130
What happened?

7249
04:08:26,550 --> 04:08:27,670
What happened was.

7250
04:08:29,590 --> 04:08:33,350
She threw Axel to the stairs and it didn't hit.

7251
04:08:33,970 --> 04:08:34,950
It didn't activate.

7252
04:08:35,490 --> 04:08:36,750
He didn't get stunned.

7253
04:08:36,870 --> 04:08:38,250
He was supposed to get stunned but didn't.

7254
04:08:38,550 --> 04:08:39,110
He was supposed to get stunned but didn't.

7255
04:08:39,110 --> 04:08:39,530
Oh.

7256
04:08:39,790 --> 04:08:40,310
Oh.

7257
04:08:41,790 --> 04:08:43,310
King you better get up.

7258
04:08:43,950 --> 04:08:45,850
How many seconds have you been outside?

7259
04:08:46,430 --> 04:08:46,950
Two.

7260
04:08:47,070 --> 04:08:47,590
Oh okay two.

7261
04:08:47,690 --> 04:08:48,250
It got reset.

7262
04:08:49,050 --> 04:08:50,530
The dog loves it outside.

7263
04:08:50,530 --> 04:08:51,470
The match is rigged against Doki.

7264
04:08:51,690 --> 04:08:52,530
And Opa!

7265
04:08:53,250 --> 04:08:53,770
Stunned!

7266
04:08:54,850 --> 04:08:56,050
But she's outside.

7267
04:08:56,330 --> 04:08:58,030
You need to get her in.

7268
04:08:58,210 --> 04:08:58,730
Four.

7269
04:08:58,750 --> 04:08:59,230
Four.

7270
04:09:00,930 --> 04:09:01,930
She's gonna stand up.

7271
04:09:02,150 --> 04:09:03,730
The stun meter is refreshed.

7272
04:09:05,550 --> 04:09:06,670
They're going back in.

7273
04:09:08,010 --> 04:09:08,830
Uh Doki?

7274
04:09:09,110 --> 04:09:10,690
Is Doki running away?

7275
04:09:11,810 --> 04:09:12,590
Oh no!

7276
04:09:13,910 --> 04:09:15,230
Axel let her in!

7277
04:09:15,550 --> 04:09:16,150
Let her in!

7278
04:09:16,150 --> 04:09:16,830
Resetting the timer.

7279
04:09:18,550 --> 04:09:20,290
Axel's not giving Doki a chance!

7280
04:09:20,950 --> 04:09:21,870
Go back!

7281
04:09:22,010 --> 04:09:22,910
Go back Israel!

7282
04:09:23,550 --> 04:09:24,990
Oh it wasn't enough.

7283
04:09:25,670 --> 04:09:26,270
Gravel.

7284
04:09:26,390 --> 04:09:28,470
Is it in favor of Axel or...

7285
04:09:28,470 --> 04:09:30,490
I think this might be the final thing.

7286
04:09:30,750 --> 04:09:31,510
Is it?

7287
04:09:31,910 --> 04:09:32,590
Is it?

7288
04:09:32,630 --> 04:09:32,870
Is it?

7289
04:09:33,010 --> 04:09:33,770
Oh a suplex!

7290
04:09:34,090 --> 04:09:34,830
Oh yeah!

7291
04:09:37,570 --> 04:09:38,590
Suplex continuous.

7292
04:09:39,110 --> 04:09:40,010
And another one!

7293
04:09:40,110 --> 04:09:41,330
This is definitely King!

7294
04:09:41,410 --> 04:09:43,030
King from Tekken!

7295
04:09:43,670 --> 04:09:44,870
It's Jover!

7296
04:09:45,290 --> 04:09:46,390
Oh stunned.

7297
04:09:46,470 --> 04:09:47,810
The finisher has been set.

7298
04:09:47,850 --> 04:09:48,790
Pin pin pin!

7299
04:09:48,930 --> 04:09:49,850
Is it enough?

7300
04:09:50,850 --> 04:09:51,450
One!

7301
04:09:51,450 --> 04:09:52,050
Two!

7302
04:09:52,490 --> 04:09:53,090
Three!

7303
04:09:53,270 --> 04:09:55,830
Stop slapping the dog's face referee!

7304
04:09:56,230 --> 04:09:57,950
Please please you're not helping.

7305
04:09:59,490 --> 04:10:04,050
Not gonna lie that move though kinda reminds me of King from Tekken.

7306
04:10:05,650 --> 04:10:08,930
The uh unlimited combo grapple.

7307
04:10:09,110 --> 04:10:09,510
Oh my god!

7308
04:10:10,470 --> 04:10:12,550
A dive attack from such a big person.

7309
04:10:12,830 --> 04:10:13,450
This is it!

7310
04:10:13,470 --> 04:10:13,930
This is it!

7311
04:10:13,950 --> 04:10:14,630
A finisher!

7312
04:10:14,730 --> 04:10:15,390
I know this one!

7313
04:10:15,510 --> 04:10:16,530
It's a default finisher!

7314
04:10:16,730 --> 04:10:16,930
Oh!

7315
04:10:18,490 --> 04:10:19,190
No it isn't!

7316
04:10:19,230 --> 04:10:19,390
Oh!

7317
04:10:20,030 --> 04:10:20,910
Again again again!

7318
04:10:21,250 --> 04:10:21,650
One more!

7319
04:10:21,650 --> 04:10:22,390
One more in him!

7320
04:10:23,070 --> 04:10:24,010
Oh one more!

7321
04:10:24,010 --> 04:10:24,570
This is it!

7322
04:10:24,570 --> 04:10:24,910
This is it!

7323
04:10:25,110 --> 04:10:25,510
Three!

7324
04:10:25,570 --> 04:10:26,190
Doki wins!

7325
04:10:26,270 --> 04:10:27,090
I'm sorry Axel.

7326
04:10:27,230 --> 04:10:28,130
This is the end.

7327
04:10:28,510 --> 04:10:29,290
This is it!

7328
04:10:29,290 --> 04:10:29,710
This is over.

7329
04:10:31,350 --> 04:10:32,590
Pin pin pin pin pin!

7330
04:10:32,590 --> 04:10:32,970
Stand up!

7331
04:10:33,070 --> 04:10:33,370
Pin pin pin!

7332
04:10:33,430 --> 04:10:34,690
Why is Doki knocked out?

7333
04:10:34,690 --> 04:10:35,070
Doki!

7334
04:10:35,250 --> 04:10:36,050
Why is Doki knocked out?

7335
04:10:36,730 --> 04:10:37,210
What?

7336
04:10:38,970 --> 04:10:39,450
What?

7337
04:10:39,450 --> 04:10:39,930
What?

7338
04:10:40,130 --> 04:10:41,630
Axel what is d- Oh!

7339
04:10:42,930 --> 04:10:43,410
Pin!

7340
04:10:43,650 --> 04:10:44,190
Pin down!

7341
04:10:44,230 --> 04:10:44,430
Pin!

7342
04:10:44,630 --> 04:10:45,090
Pin!

7343
04:10:45,610 --> 04:10:46,090
Huh?

7344
04:10:46,930 --> 04:10:47,730
I'm so confused.

7345
04:10:47,730 --> 04:10:48,650
This doesn't make any sense!

7346
04:10:48,970 --> 04:10:49,750
What's happening?

7347
04:10:50,210 --> 04:10:51,390
This game is rigged.

7348
04:10:51,570 --> 04:10:52,790
This tournament is rigged.

7349
04:10:53,570 --> 04:10:54,410
Axel's gonna win!

7350
04:10:55,530 --> 04:10:56,010
Ooh!

7351
04:10:56,890 --> 04:10:57,370

04:10:58,630 --> 04:10:59,010
Doki!

7354
04:10:59,230 --> 04:11:00,110
Doki I'm...

7355
04:11:00,610 --> 04:11:02,150
I'm thinking that you have a plan.

7356
04:11:02,310 --> 04:11:02,510
Ouch.

7357
04:11:02,510 --> 04:11:04,910
But Axel get your shit together because you are gonna lose!

7358
04:11:05,450 --> 04:11:05,970
Senpai!

7359
04:11:05,970 --> 04:11:07,010
Axel is getting pummeled.

7360
04:11:07,810 --> 04:11:09,010
Axel isn't fighting back.

7361
04:11:10,250 --> 04:11:12,130
Doki's gonna tear all his limbs off.

7362
04:11:13,270 --> 04:11:13,790
Senpai!

7363
04:11:14,650 --> 04:11:15,170
TATAKAE!

7364
04:11:16,030 --> 04:11:17,290
Oh nothing's happening.

7365
04:11:17,770 --> 04:11:18,770
He's still stunned.

7366
04:11:19,330 --> 04:11:20,090
Oh shit!

7367
04:11:20,190 --> 04:11:21,270
Another finisher!

7368
04:11:21,510 --> 04:11:22,570
Another finisher!

7369
04:11:25,590 --> 04:11:27,210
This is so painful to watch!

7370
04:11:27,210 --> 04:11:27,590
Oh my fucking god!

7371
04:11:27,930 --> 04:11:28,190
Oh!

7372
04:11:30,710 --> 04:11:31,230
Why?

7373
04:11:31,230 --> 04:11:32,270
Axel might win!

7374
04:11:32,510 --> 04:11:33,570
Oh shit!

7375
04:11:33,670 --> 04:11:34,150
It's over!

7376
04:11:34,270 --> 04:11:35,010
It's... OOOH!

7377
04:11:35,010 --> 04:11:35,790
Another spear!

7378
04:11:36,250 --> 04:11:37,610
He's headed up top!

7379
04:11:39,050 --> 04:11:40,470
Oh here we go!

7380
04:11:40,510 --> 04:11:40,750
And jumping!

7381
04:11:40,750 --> 04:11:41,430
And OOOH!

7382
04:11:43,950 --> 04:11:46,470
Is Doki stunned enough to not get into the ring?

7383
04:11:47,690 --> 04:11:48,790
After 10 counts?

7384
04:11:48,910 --> 04:11:50,410
Oh and she's stunned.

7385
04:11:50,930 --> 04:11:51,730
She's stunned.

7386
04:11:52,890 --> 04:11:54,510
Axel's doing the finisher.

7387
04:11:54,870 --> 04:11:56,070
Axel's gonna do the finisher.

7388
04:11:56,470 --> 04:11:57,390
The finisher!

7389
04:11:57,550 --> 04:11:58,130
He's waiting!

7390
04:12:00,850 --> 04:12:01,370
What?

7391
04:12:02,510 --> 04:12:02,890
And slammed!

7392
04:12:03,950 --> 04:12:04,450
Chokeslam!

7393
04:12:06,610 --> 04:12:07,650
Put her in the ring!

7394
04:12:09,190 --> 04:12:09,910
Oh shit.

7395
04:12:10,050 --> 04:12:10,330
Damn!

7396
04:12:10,630 --> 04:12:11,410
Oh here we go.

7397
04:12:11,490 --> 04:12:11,930
This is it.

7398
04:12:12,390 --> 04:12:13,210
Axel just...

7399
04:12:13,210 --> 04:12:13,210
Is this it?

7400
04:12:13,670 --> 04:12:16,110
Is this it?

7401
04:12:16,250 --> 04:12:17,090
Is this it?

7402
04:12:17,130 --> 04:12:17,590
Oh my god!

7403
04:12:17,630 --> 04:12:18,930
He's nodding off the fucking fingers!

7404
04:12:19,590 --> 04:12:20,630
Oh my god!

7405
04:12:21,090 --> 04:12:22,210
Oh my god!

7406
04:12:23,990 --> 04:12:25,530
This is a long battle.

7407
04:12:25,790 --> 04:12:26,590
It is!

7408
04:12:26,890 --> 04:12:27,630
It is!

7409
04:12:28,210 --> 04:12:30,370
There's so many moments where Doki was in...

7410
04:12:30,370 --> 04:12:31,330
Oh here it is!

7411
04:12:32,050 --> 04:12:32,930
Here we go!

7412
04:12:33,210 --> 04:12:34,170
Oh there's a fumble.

7413
04:12:34,290 --> 04:12:34,990
I can already tell.

7414
04:12:35,090 --> 04:12:35,790
Is this a fumble?

7415
04:12:37,490 --> 04:12:38,010
Oh Axel!

7416
04:12:38,010 --> 04:12:38,130
Oh Axel!

7417
04:12:38,130 --> 04:12:38,410
Oh Axel!

7418
04:12:42,130 --> 04:12:42,910
Oh he's dead.

7419
04:12:43,010 --> 04:12:43,370
He's down.

7420
04:12:43,410 --> 04:12:43,790
He's doomed.

7421
04:12:43,810 --> 04:12:44,190
He's doomed.

7422
04:12:44,210 --> 04:12:44,950
He's doomed.

7423
04:12:44,950 --> 04:12:45,170
Okay.

7424
04:12:45,310 --> 04:12:46,150
It's over.

7425
04:12:47,270 --> 04:12:47,790
One!

7426
04:12:47,790 --> 04:12:48,310
Two!

7427
04:12:49,030 --> 04:12:49,550
Three!

7428
04:12:51,990 --> 04:12:54,270
The trash talker loses again!

7429
04:12:55,410 --> 04:12:56,090
The trash talker loses again!

7430
04:12:56,090 --> 04:12:57,310
Here is your winner!

7431
04:12:57,310 --> 04:12:59,530
She is the word!

7432
04:13:01,550 --> 04:13:02,150
DOKI!

7433
04:13:07,950 --> 04:13:08,550
BAAAAAAAAD!

7434
04:13:09,750 --> 04:13:10,350
DOKI!

7435
04:13:10,410 --> 04:13:10,470
BAAAAAAAAD!

7436
04:13:10,470 --> 04:13:12,050
Doki came out on top baby!

7437
04:13:15,970 --> 04:13:16,570
Wow.

7438
04:13:16,870 --> 04:13:17,870
Four out of five.

7439
04:13:18,310 --> 04:13:18,410
Wow.

7440
04:13:18,410 --> 04:13:18,410
Four out of five.

7441
04:13:18,410 --> 04:13:18,950
Amazing.

7442
04:13:19,370 --> 04:13:19,590
That was great.

7443
04:13:19,770 --> 04:13:20,290
That was intense.

7444
04:13:20,570 --> 04:13:21,010
Intense.

7445
04:13:21,250 --> 04:13:23,550
I've never seen like an animal matchup before.

7446
04:13:23,550 --> 04:13:26,590
I can't believe the only holostars in play are me and Bettle.

7447
04:13:26,690 --> 04:13:27,290
I've never seen like an animal matchup before.

7448
04:13:30,810 --> 04:13:31,330
I've never seen like an animal matchup before.

7449
04:13:31,330 --> 04:13:32,130
Guys, you better.

7450
04:13:32,270 --> 04:13:32,710
You better.

7451
04:13:32,890 --> 04:13:33,250
Guys, you better.

7452
04:13:33,250 --> 04:13:33,250
You better.

7453
04:13:33,250 --> 04:13:35,630
Alright, let's switch on to the interview section.

7454
04:13:35,890 --> 04:13:36,970
Everybody, let's go.

7455
04:13:37,650 --> 04:13:38,170
DOKI!

7456
04:13:39,130 --> 04:13:40,490
What can I say?

7457
04:13:40,650 --> 04:13:41,210
Let's go!

7458
04:13:41,550 --> 04:13:43,470
Just like Steve Irwin.

7459
04:13:43,970 --> 04:13:44,830
How are you doing?

7460
04:13:45,330 --> 04:13:45,850
Axel?

7461
04:13:46,450 --> 04:13:47,690
You got Steve Irwin.

7462
04:13:47,690 --> 04:13:48,310
God damn.

7463
04:13:49,510 --> 04:13:53,130
I must ask, how was it fighting in a fursuit?

7464
04:13:54,930 --> 04:13:57,290
I must ask, how was it fighting in a fursuit?

7465
04:13:57,290 --> 04:13:57,490
You know what?

7466
04:13:57,490 --> 04:13:57,490
I'm a good fighter, so I'm not sure I'll win too soon.

7467
04:13:57,710 --> 04:13:58,950
Just wait for me.

7468
04:13:59,710 --> 04:14:01,190
I'll try to keep you waiting.

7469
04:14:03,470 --> 04:14:05,450
Honestly, you know, I was like yo...

7470
04:14:07,410 --> 04:14:09,090
I had to give it up, right?

7471
04:14:09,350 --> 04:14:10,230
I mean...

7472
04:14:11,010 --> 04:14:11,830
Give up the ghost?

7473
04:14:12,250 --> 04:14:12,650
Bro!

7474
04:14:13,570 --> 04:14:14,430
That means some big money.

7475
04:14:14,430 --> 04:14:15,450
Why do you have to give it up though?

7476
04:14:15,790 --> 04:14:16,870
That means some big money.

7477
04:14:17,570 --> 04:14:19,370
Oh, you fucking threw it!

7478
04:14:20,730 --> 04:14:21,150
Somebody sent that in there!

7479
04:14:21,150 --> 04:14:24,150
Somebody sent that in there!

7480
04:14:25,990 --> 04:14:27,270
I don't know, but yeah...

7481
04:14:27,290 --> 04:14:28,070
Guys!

7482
04:14:28,070 --> 04:14:30,470
There are so many more games still left.

7483
04:14:30,650 --> 04:14:37,050
Make sure to use the app, BeBets, to get your best bets on Geekiverse now, today!

7484
04:14:39,870 --> 04:14:42,230
No, no, no, this is already falling apart.

7485
04:14:42,630 --> 04:14:43,810
Go for the underdog.

7486
04:14:43,950 --> 04:14:45,290
That's what I'm saying, go for the underdog.

7487
04:14:45,330 --> 04:14:46,950
You make some big money on the underdog, yo.

7488
04:14:47,330 --> 04:14:49,550
Oh my god, he did this on purpose.

7489
04:14:49,630 --> 04:14:53,370
He talked mad shit so people would vote against him!

7490
04:14:54,510 --> 04:14:55,490
You know me.

7491
04:14:55,490 --> 04:14:56,410
What the heck?

7492
04:14:57,290 --> 04:14:58,570
Bro took the fall.

7493
04:14:58,570 --> 04:14:58,690
He's a businessman.

7494
04:14:58,950 --> 04:14:59,930
He got the money, yeah.

7495
04:15:00,010 --> 04:15:01,170
He's a business thinker.

7496
04:15:01,870 --> 04:15:03,390
Hell yeah, you know me.

7497
04:15:03,410 --> 04:15:06,130
Hey, but that Gucci suit, I can sell it off as well.

7498
04:15:06,270 --> 04:15:07,490
Make a couple of extra bucks.

7499
04:15:08,110 --> 04:15:11,570
I mean, it's all business at the end of the day, you know?

7500
04:15:11,890 --> 04:15:13,450
The Gucci fursuit?

7501
04:15:13,650 --> 04:15:15,230
The Gucci fursuit.

7502
04:15:15,250 --> 04:15:18,090
I didn't know Gucci made fursuits.

7503
04:15:18,090 --> 04:15:18,830
That's crazy.

7504
04:15:18,830 --> 04:15:19,610
I mean, hey!

7505
04:15:19,910 --> 04:15:21,850
But fursuits are a hell of expensive though.

7506
04:15:22,370 --> 04:15:24,670
You have a Gucci fursuit?

7507
04:15:24,830 --> 04:15:25,190
Yeah.

7508
04:15:26,130 --> 04:15:26,670
Damn.

7509
04:15:27,770 --> 04:15:30,770
It's got my sweat all over it as well.

7510
04:15:31,470 --> 04:15:32,670
It's got that scent.

7511
04:15:33,330 --> 04:15:34,410
It's got that flavor.

7512
04:15:34,850 --> 04:15:36,890
Check out eBay after this match.

7513
04:15:36,930 --> 04:15:41,650
He's gonna be auctioning that out because he needs to pay his medical bills after that.

7514
04:15:41,990 --> 04:15:43,390
Nah, nah, nah, bro.

7515
04:15:43,470 --> 04:15:45,430
You saw me playing with my gamer sweat.

7516
04:15:46,250 --> 04:15:47,370
Oops, sorry.

7517
04:15:47,650 --> 04:15:48,630
I got a call.

7518
04:15:49,010 --> 04:15:50,370
Oh no, I got a call.

7519
04:15:50,430 --> 04:15:54,250
Guys, he's getting his cash out right now.

7520
04:15:54,630 --> 04:15:56,370
He's getting his cash out from VBEX.

7521
04:15:56,870 --> 04:15:57,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7522
04:15:57,390 --> 04:15:58,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

7523
04:15:58,250 --> 04:15:59,310
I ain't checking my paper.

7524
04:15:59,370 --> 04:16:00,110
Sorry, that's my...

7525
04:16:01,390 --> 04:16:03,530
The money has transferred.

7526
04:16:04,050 --> 04:16:05,990
Oh no, they calling me shit.

7527
04:16:06,050 --> 04:16:06,450
But hey.

7528
04:16:06,930 --> 04:16:12,270
You know, I mean, you saw me playing with my food and rigging the odds a bit, you know?

7529
04:16:12,350 --> 04:16:14,390
Because I was smashing her at the start.

7530
04:16:14,810 --> 04:16:15,430
Yeah, you did.

7531
04:16:15,730 --> 04:16:17,210
So everyone's like, oh my god, Axel's gonna win.

7532
04:16:17,970 --> 04:16:19,370
And then that's when I'm like, alright.

7533
04:16:20,450 --> 04:16:21,130
Cinema time.

7534
04:16:21,310 --> 04:16:21,830
Time for me to go.

7535
04:16:22,250 --> 04:16:22,610
Okay, grandpa.

7536
04:16:22,970 --> 04:16:23,330
Absolutely.

7537
04:16:23,510 --> 04:16:24,010
That's when I...

7538
04:16:24,250 --> 04:16:25,170
That's when I win.

7539
04:16:25,310 --> 04:16:26,850
Nah, I'd win.

7540
04:16:27,850 --> 04:16:29,950
Guys, I win all of them.

7541
04:16:30,490 --> 04:16:33,890
Guys, his post also looks like an absolute cinema moment.

7542
04:16:34,030 --> 04:16:34,830
Look at that, guys.

7543
04:16:34,850 --> 04:16:35,370
Look at that.

7544
04:16:35,790 --> 04:16:37,110
Hell yeah.

7545
04:16:37,230 --> 04:16:37,630
But yeah.

7546
04:16:38,110 --> 04:16:39,590
Congratulations to Doki!

7547
04:16:39,870 --> 04:16:42,110
The tournament organizer is the winner!

7548
04:16:43,430 --> 04:16:44,290
Not rigged!

7549
04:16:44,590 --> 04:16:45,150
Congrats!

7550
04:16:45,230 --> 04:16:47,230
Wrestling is not scripted, guys.

7551
04:16:47,950 --> 04:16:48,970
I'm just saying.

7552
04:16:49,030 --> 04:16:49,410
Hey.

7553
04:16:50,550 --> 04:16:51,810
Hey, I'm just saying, Doki.

7554
04:16:51,810 --> 04:16:53,190
It's a win-win situation.

7555
04:16:53,290 --> 04:16:54,690
I know, yeah, yeah.

7556
04:16:55,230 --> 04:16:56,290
And the viewers?

7557
04:16:56,690 --> 04:16:57,790
They were entertained.

7558
04:16:57,950 --> 04:16:58,610
Were they not?

7559
04:16:58,810 --> 04:17:00,270
Because we split the cash, right?

7560
04:17:00,470 --> 04:17:02,670
We made it look so real, right?

7561
04:17:02,990 --> 04:17:03,450
Hell no.

7562
04:17:03,510 --> 04:17:04,910
Take your fucking dub and get...

7563
04:17:04,910 --> 04:17:06,470
Take your fucking dub.

7564
04:17:06,550 --> 04:17:07,370
Hell no.

7565
04:17:07,670 --> 04:17:09,490
Take your dub and go home, bro.

7566
04:17:10,970 --> 04:17:11,450
G...

7567
04:17:12,270 --> 04:17:13,230
G's, Axel.

7568
04:17:13,890 --> 04:17:16,210
Too bad I can't pummel you again.

7569
04:17:17,470 --> 04:17:18,010
Oh, well.

7570
04:17:18,090 --> 04:17:19,570
Maybe next time.

7571
04:17:19,570 --> 04:17:20,710
Maybe next time you get a match.

7572
04:17:20,710 --> 04:17:22,570
Maybe next year, 2025, WrestleTuber.

7573
04:17:23,490 --> 04:17:24,230
Oh, shit.

7574
04:17:25,170 --> 04:17:26,410
Next year we doing the game.

7575
04:17:26,690 --> 04:17:28,190
I'mma be... I'mma be too...

7576
04:17:28,190 --> 04:17:29,290
What are you gonna do this year, bro?

7577
04:17:29,670 --> 04:17:31,110
We'll run it back, of course!

7578
04:17:31,310 --> 04:17:33,150
Of course, why else would there be 2024?

7579
04:17:33,830 --> 04:17:34,810
I want a rematch!

7580
04:17:35,530 --> 04:17:35,970
Rematch!

7581
04:17:36,570 --> 04:17:39,930
Next time, Drog will last longer than one round.

7582
04:17:40,750 --> 04:17:42,150
You sure about that?

7583
04:17:44,130 --> 04:17:44,810
Making a series, you know?

7584
04:17:44,810 --> 04:17:46,490
I'm gonna make my character bulkier this time.

7585
04:17:52,270 --> 04:17:53,670
But yeah, is there any more?

7586
04:17:53,970 --> 04:17:54,670
It's about the mentality.

7587
04:17:55,090 --> 04:17:55,490
Yeah.

7588
04:17:55,630 --> 04:17:56,630
Yeah, I suppose.

7589
04:17:57,030 --> 04:17:59,870
Are there any more opponents that we can, like, uh...

7590
04:18:00,650 --> 04:18:01,530
Look forward to?

7591
04:18:01,530 --> 04:18:03,230
I think we're going to an intermission.

7592
04:18:03,250 --> 04:18:08,330
Yes, we are going to one more final intermission for one last caster rotation.

7593
04:18:09,030 --> 04:18:11,590
We have two games left, everybody.

7594
04:18:12,310 --> 04:18:16,410
So, we're gonna rotate our casters to Fillion and Snug.

7595
04:18:16,490 --> 04:18:18,570
And we're gonna go to the intermission now.

7596
04:18:18,570 --> 04:18:21,030
So, we're gonna go to the intermission now.

7597
04:18:21,130 --> 04:18:24,690
Let's thank Octavia and Gerard for the casting, everybody!

7598
04:18:25,530 --> 04:18:25,970
Let's thank Octavia and Gerard for the casting, everybody!

7599
04:18:25,970 --> 04:18:26,050
Yeah!

7600
04:18:26,270 --> 04:18:27,010
Thank you!

7601
04:18:28,830 --> 04:18:30,030
Bowing, bowing, bowing.

7602
04:18:30,030 --> 04:18:31,090
Thank you for having us here.

7603
04:18:31,250 --> 04:18:33,450
And really sorry about the dumb comments that we've been making.

7604
04:18:33,590 --> 04:18:34,410
It's just our first time.

7605
04:18:34,490 --> 04:18:35,670
Okay, really sorry about that.

7606
04:18:35,810 --> 04:18:37,310
I just wanna fucking wrestle.

7607
04:18:37,650 --> 04:18:37,890
That's it.

7608
04:18:38,870 --> 04:18:39,450
Own it!

7609
04:18:39,650 --> 04:18:40,630
Own the casting!

7610
04:18:41,290 --> 04:18:43,190
You think I know what I'm talking about?

7611
04:18:43,290 --> 04:18:46,470
We called the fucking London Bridge is falling down and the Humphrey Bridge is falling down.

7612
04:18:46,490 --> 04:18:46,950
That's it!

7613
04:18:49,290 --> 04:18:51,350
So, we're going intermission now, right?

7614
04:18:51,430 --> 04:18:52,370
Yeah, we're going intermission.

7615
04:18:52,690 --> 04:18:53,290
Alright, you guys.

7616
04:18:53,310 --> 04:18:57,610
During the break, make sure to check the VBET apps and make sure to bet on the underdog!

7617
04:18:58,130 --> 04:18:59,430
Nice to see you guys all.

7618
04:18:59,890 --> 04:19:00,850
Alright, bye-bye!

7619
04:19:01,490 --> 04:19:03,390
I gotta kick you guys off the main stage too.

7620
04:19:03,490 --> 04:19:03,730
Leave.

7621
04:19:06,350 --> 04:19:07,830
Alright, intermission now!

7622
04:26:17,020 --> 04:26:18,620
Hello everybody!

7623
04:26:19,360 --> 04:26:22,340
This is Backstage Doki here.

7624
04:26:22,500 --> 04:26:25,240
Getting ready for the final...

7625
04:26:25,240 --> 04:26:27,380
The final two matches.

7626
04:26:27,560 --> 04:26:30,580
I am not on screen because this is Backstage Doki.

7627
04:26:30,840 --> 04:26:33,280
Not Caster Doki right now.

7628
04:26:33,660 --> 04:26:34,540
Not Caster Doki right now.

7629
04:26:34,540 --> 04:26:34,840
Not Caster Doki right now.

7630
04:26:34,840 --> 04:26:37,240
We have two final matches.

7631
04:26:37,480 --> 04:26:38,620
We have two final matches.

7632
04:26:38,620 --> 04:26:42,340
Casted by Fillion and Snuffy.

7633
04:26:42,520 --> 04:26:43,620
Casted by Fillion and Snuffy.

7634
04:26:43,620 --> 04:26:45,460
Calling them in real quick, guys.

7635
04:26:45,600 --> 04:26:46,900
Gotta put them on the table.

7636
04:26:47,300 --> 04:26:48,420
Real quick chat.

7637
04:26:50,380 --> 04:26:50,940
Just kidding.

7638
04:26:50,980 --> 04:26:51,820
We gotta find them.

7639
04:26:51,960 --> 04:26:52,840
Where could they be?

7640
04:26:53,740 --> 04:26:55,180
Where could they be, guys?

7641
04:26:55,420 --> 04:26:56,300
Where did they go?

7642
04:26:57,260 --> 04:26:57,660
Okay.

7643
04:26:58,160 --> 04:26:59,020
There's one of them.

7644
04:26:59,200 --> 04:26:59,600
Hey.

7645
04:27:03,380 --> 04:27:04,360
There's one of them.

7646
04:27:04,720 --> 04:27:05,240
She's here.

7647
04:27:06,160 --> 04:27:07,040
Alright, don't worry.

7648
04:27:07,120 --> 04:27:07,960
I pushed her in here.

7649
04:27:08,340 --> 04:27:10,460
She doesn't have her mic set up yet, guys.

7650
04:27:10,620 --> 04:27:12,580
We didn't put the headphones in yet, guys.

7651
04:27:12,740 --> 04:27:13,600
So, give us a second.

7652
04:27:13,620 --> 04:27:14,560
Don't worry.

7653
04:27:14,640 --> 04:27:16,720
We have our second caster here.

7654
04:27:17,300 --> 04:27:18,520
Our second caster.

7655
04:27:18,620 --> 04:27:19,600
And there she is.

7656
04:27:20,020 --> 04:27:21,120
There she is.

7657
04:27:21,440 --> 04:27:23,620
We have our final two matches.

7658
04:27:24,000 --> 04:27:25,480
Bulk Bogan vs.

7659
04:27:26,000 --> 04:27:26,500
Doki.

7660
04:27:26,880 --> 04:27:28,380
And Beta vs.

7661
04:27:28,840 --> 04:27:29,400
Octavio.

7662
04:27:29,480 --> 04:27:31,020
Let's get them in the room.

7663
04:27:31,080 --> 04:27:32,720
Put the mics on them real fast.

7664
04:27:33,220 --> 04:27:36,600
Put the mics on them real fast.

7665
04:27:36,600 --> 04:27:37,100
Hello.

7666
04:27:38,320 --> 04:27:38,880
Welcome.

7667
04:27:39,100 --> 04:27:40,520
Are you guys ready to cast?

7668
04:27:40,800 --> 04:27:40,960
Yeah.

7669
04:27:41,000 --> 04:27:42,700
You guys are on the main screen now.

7670
04:27:43,780 --> 04:27:44,660
Oh, shit.

7671
04:27:46,200 --> 04:27:47,860
They got the budget for me.

7672
04:27:47,920 --> 04:27:50,000
I may be 240p, but at least I'm animated.

7673
04:27:51,040 --> 04:27:52,240
What the hell?

7674
04:27:52,940 --> 04:27:54,460
I've been flattened and condensed.

7675
04:27:56,320 --> 04:27:56,840
I've been flattened and condensed.

7676
04:27:56,840 --> 04:27:58,620
Why am I so fuzzy, bro?

7677
04:27:58,880 --> 04:27:59,380
Why am I so fuzzy, bro?

7678
04:27:59,380 --> 04:28:03,320
We look like an episode of Amazing World of Godfall.

7679
04:28:03,360 --> 04:28:03,760
We look like an episode of Amazing World of Godfall.

7680
04:28:03,760 --> 04:28:05,260
Bro, we're redacted.

7681
04:28:09,300 --> 04:28:09,780
Alright.

7682
04:28:10,000 --> 04:28:12,180
Well, you know, I'm done beating children.

7683
04:28:12,300 --> 04:28:13,160
It's time to cast them.

7684
04:28:13,160 --> 04:28:14,600
So let's definitely get down to this, Jolyne.

7685
04:28:17,020 --> 04:28:18,460
This is Backstage Doki.

7686
04:28:18,540 --> 04:28:20,940
Do you guys remember what are the two last matches?

7687
04:28:22,820 --> 04:28:23,260
Me?

7688
04:28:23,520 --> 04:28:24,720
I mean, you're casting?

7689
04:28:24,900 --> 04:28:26,740
Of course.

7690
04:28:26,960 --> 04:28:27,180
Yes.

7691
04:28:27,220 --> 04:28:28,780
Let me just go check my DM.

7692
04:28:30,000 --> 04:28:31,960
That snuffy is not sending me right now.

7693
04:28:32,460 --> 04:28:34,660
Casters, please look at the broadcast chat, casters.

7694
04:28:34,960 --> 04:28:35,400
Alright.

7695
04:28:36,060 --> 04:28:38,640
I'm afraid... broadcast chat.

7696
04:28:39,040 --> 04:28:40,560
Yeah, I watched that match.

7697
04:28:40,560 --> 04:28:41,600
That was really epic.

7698
04:28:42,040 --> 04:28:44,740
You were... I thought you were... I didn't think you were gonna make it.

7699
04:28:44,840 --> 04:28:46,040
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

7700
04:28:46,080 --> 04:28:46,780
I'll be honest with you.

7701
04:28:47,320 --> 04:28:48,540
Am I interviewing you?

7702
04:28:49,060 --> 04:28:50,280
Yeah, you're gonna interview me!

7703
04:28:51,360 --> 04:28:51,960
And Sarah!

7704
04:28:52,900 --> 04:28:53,960
Guys, you're the...

7705
04:28:53,960 --> 04:28:55,680
Guys, why are you asking me questions?

7706
04:28:55,740 --> 04:28:56,540
You're the casters!

7707
04:28:56,680 --> 04:28:58,060
I'm Backstage Doki!

7708
04:28:59,120 --> 04:29:00,500
Wait, I don't see any...

7709
04:29:00,500 --> 04:29:02,460
I don't see who's up next.

7710
04:29:03,060 --> 04:29:03,780
What do you mean?

7711
04:29:03,780 --> 04:29:04,640
I typed it in wrong.

7712
04:29:05,060 --> 04:29:05,420
Yes!

7713
04:29:06,020 --> 04:29:09,000
Well, that's really crazy, because apparently I can't read.

7714
04:29:09,060 --> 04:29:09,200
Oh!

7715
04:29:10,760 --> 04:29:11,720
I see.

7716
04:29:11,900 --> 04:29:12,300
Okay.

7717
04:29:12,600 --> 04:29:15,360
And I just got word from the casters desk.

7718
04:29:15,520 --> 04:29:17,820
I put my hand in my ear to look really cool while I'm doing it.

7719
04:29:17,940 --> 04:29:20,280
But right now I'm a Vtuber, so you can't see that.

7720
04:29:20,560 --> 04:29:27,660
So, our next match I'm getting word is gonna be no one other than Backstage Doki coming out to the forefront.

7721
04:29:27,960 --> 04:29:28,820
She's back!

7722
04:29:29,260 --> 04:29:33,380
And her opponent is none other than Miss Sarah?

7723
04:29:33,720 --> 04:29:34,200
Sarah?

7724
04:29:34,620 --> 04:29:36,640
However you say it, she's here to fight.

7725
04:29:38,660 --> 04:29:39,140
Sarah.

7726
04:29:40,880 --> 04:29:41,780
Wait, how did...

7727
04:29:41,780 --> 04:29:43,140
Is it Sarah or Sarat?

7728
04:29:43,200 --> 04:29:44,880
I'm getting blamed in the comments right now.

7729
04:29:45,900 --> 04:29:46,920
Oh my god.

7730
04:29:47,100 --> 04:29:50,440
Let me put you guys into the The casters aren't here.

7731
04:29:50,980 --> 04:29:52,980
The casters are walking here, guys!

7732
04:29:53,500 --> 04:29:54,480
The place!

7733
04:29:54,540 --> 04:29:54,860
The place!

7734
04:29:54,860 --> 04:29:57,480
Oh gosh, you guys are so big.

7735
04:29:57,920 --> 04:29:58,400
Sorry.

7736
04:29:59,620 --> 04:30:00,560
Wait, I'm huge!

7737
04:30:02,840 --> 04:30:03,640
There we go.

7738
04:30:03,960 --> 04:30:05,100
The casters are here now.

7739
04:30:06,460 --> 04:30:07,580
But Sarah's not.

7740
04:30:07,640 --> 04:30:08,620
Give us a sec.

7741
04:30:08,620 --> 04:30:09,720
We're waiting for her.

7742
04:30:09,740 --> 04:30:10,160
Sorry.

7743
04:30:10,500 --> 04:30:10,980
Sorry.

7744
04:30:10,980 --> 04:30:13,460
We're here for some reason.

7745
04:30:13,620 --> 04:30:13,640
We're here for some reason.

7746
04:30:16,680 --> 04:30:17,240
Don't worry.

7747
04:30:17,520 --> 04:30:18,380
There she is.

7748
04:30:19,320 --> 04:30:20,280
Oh, I arrived!

7749
04:30:20,700 --> 04:30:22,320
Oh, beautiful.

7750
04:30:22,600 --> 04:30:23,080
Beautiful.

7751
04:30:23,740 --> 04:30:24,660
Very nice.

7752
04:30:24,800 --> 04:30:25,800
I like the snake.

7753
04:30:27,360 --> 04:30:29,600
If I win, it will come out at the end.

7754
04:30:29,800 --> 04:30:29,840
If I win, it will come out at the end.

7755
04:30:29,840 --> 04:30:30,300
Yeah.

7756
04:30:31,600 --> 04:30:34,100
You're not allowed to bring summons into the arena, right?

7757
04:30:34,120 --> 04:30:35,040
Yeah, that's not fair.

7758
04:30:35,040 --> 04:30:38,340
If you can bring a snake, I can bring a jaguar.

7759
04:30:39,240 --> 04:30:41,280
But you are the jaguar.

7760
04:30:41,420 --> 04:30:43,060
Are you not, Mr. King?

7761
04:30:43,160 --> 04:30:44,320
I can have two.

7762
04:30:45,960 --> 04:30:46,440
Oh.

7763
04:30:46,560 --> 04:30:47,380
It's not fair.

7764
04:30:48,520 --> 04:30:52,040
We're turning this whole match into a jungle at this point.

7765
04:30:52,620 --> 04:30:53,160
I mean, we are.

7766
04:30:53,380 --> 04:30:59,100
I mean, 99% of the people here are I mean, 100% of us are animals.

7767
04:31:00,400 --> 04:31:01,260
Oh my god.

7768
04:31:01,880 --> 04:31:02,340
Really?

7769
04:31:03,380 --> 04:31:04,740
I'm not amongst you.

7770
04:31:05,040 --> 04:31:06,960
What do you mean you literally have cat ears?

7771
04:31:07,600 --> 04:31:08,620
Bro, that's not...

7772
04:31:08,620 --> 04:31:09,520
No, these are fake.

7773
04:31:09,600 --> 04:31:10,660
They're actually canonically fake.

7774
04:31:10,740 --> 04:31:11,360
They're canonically fake.

7775
04:31:11,460 --> 04:31:11,940
I can take them off.

7776
04:31:12,060 --> 04:31:15,900
Bro, okay, when I was like, Hey, which wrestler do you want to represent you?

7777
04:31:16,060 --> 04:31:18,580
She was like, my chat wants the furry one.

7778
04:31:18,700 --> 04:31:20,180
So I'm gonna pick that one.

7779
04:31:24,150 --> 04:31:25,290
Oh my god.

7780
04:31:25,530 --> 04:31:26,290
You don't need me.

7781
04:31:26,330 --> 04:31:27,410
I'm a caster, okay?

7782
04:31:27,530 --> 04:31:29,090
I'm gonna cast against you biasedly.

7783
04:31:29,730 --> 04:31:31,370
You're not supposed to be biased!

7784
04:31:31,890 --> 04:31:33,550
Yeah, I'm gonna do it, okay?

7785
04:31:33,750 --> 04:31:34,270
Stop it.

7786
04:31:34,270 --> 04:31:34,590
Stop her.

7787
04:31:36,890 --> 04:31:37,890
She's like good cop, bad cop.

7788
04:31:38,150 --> 04:31:39,030
I have to let this happen.

7789
04:31:39,130 --> 04:31:39,830
Oh, okay, okay.

7790
04:31:39,830 --> 04:31:40,930
You're the good cop then.

7791
04:31:41,030 --> 04:31:41,550
We're gonna say...

7792
04:31:41,550 --> 04:31:43,290
I'm the cop that conquers the drugs and steals them.

7793
04:31:43,370 --> 04:31:43,590
Okay.

7794
04:31:43,630 --> 04:31:45,910
Wait, Steffi, what's the good cop?

7795
04:31:46,090 --> 04:31:47,130
What are you gonna say to us?

7796
04:31:47,930 --> 04:31:48,750
Oh, um...

7797
04:31:48,750 --> 04:31:50,150
Everybody do your best.

7798
04:31:50,330 --> 04:31:50,810
Right?

7799
04:31:51,430 --> 04:31:52,630
I want more!

7800
04:31:54,350 --> 04:31:54,870
Well...

7801
04:31:55,730 --> 04:31:57,530
Everybody do your best.

7802
04:31:57,890 --> 04:31:58,950
That's why we're here.

7803
04:31:58,990 --> 04:31:59,990
Just doing our best.

7804
04:32:01,530 --> 04:32:02,070
We're going!

7805
04:32:02,850 --> 04:32:04,090
You're doing great.

7806
04:32:05,550 --> 04:32:06,590
Alright, Sarah.

7807
04:32:06,870 --> 04:32:08,210
You're fucking going...

7808
04:32:08,210 --> 04:32:08,830
I want a good clean match.

7809
04:32:09,450 --> 04:32:10,990
Sarah, you're going down.

7810
04:32:11,330 --> 04:32:13,890
I came back from a fighting game championship.

7811
04:32:14,570 --> 04:32:16,730
I know my fighting moves now.

7812
04:32:16,850 --> 04:32:17,850
So you're going down.

7813
04:32:18,290 --> 04:32:19,010
Oh my god.

7814
04:32:19,210 --> 04:32:23,110
I've heard a lot about your incredible fighting style, Doki.

7815
04:32:23,250 --> 04:32:23,590
Yeah.

7816
04:32:24,410 --> 04:32:27,030
I'm gonna put Doki in the turkey.

7817
04:32:27,430 --> 04:32:28,690
I didn't come up with anything.

7818
04:32:28,710 --> 04:32:29,950
I used my A material.

7819
04:32:30,330 --> 04:32:32,270
I used my A material on Shinri.

7820
04:32:32,430 --> 04:32:33,010
I'm so sorry.

7821
04:32:33,010 --> 04:32:33,150
Are we in kindergarten?

7822
04:32:34,090 --> 04:32:36,410
What are these insults?

7823
04:32:37,010 --> 04:32:37,970
Oh man.

7824
04:32:38,630 --> 04:32:40,870
Am I playing the child now?

7825
04:32:40,910 --> 04:32:40,950
Am I playing the child now?

7826
04:32:43,110 --> 04:32:44,590
In the semis?

7827
04:32:44,590 --> 04:32:46,170
Who let this child in?

7828
04:32:46,970 --> 04:32:48,670
I mean, she does some weird stuff.

7829
04:32:48,850 --> 04:32:49,370
I don't know.

7830
04:32:50,930 --> 04:32:52,930
Who let the snake in?

7831
04:32:53,490 --> 04:32:54,090
Who let the snake in?

7832
04:32:54,330 --> 04:32:55,910
Who let the snake in too?

7833
04:32:56,150 --> 04:32:58,430
Who let the snake in too?

7834
04:33:01,390 --> 04:33:04,070
We have two very fierce opponents here.

7835
04:33:04,090 --> 04:33:04,950
And it's going after each other.

7836
04:33:05,510 --> 04:33:06,570
What the fuck?

7837
04:33:06,570 --> 04:33:10,810
Are you also gonna land on Doki and pummel her, Sarah?

7838
04:33:11,770 --> 04:33:13,010
I hope so.

7839
04:33:13,210 --> 04:33:19,010
I have a track record of one successful landing so far.

7840
04:33:19,170 --> 04:33:24,330
So if I can make it to two, I might be the safest fictional airline in this entire competition.

7841
04:33:24,590 --> 04:33:25,130
Let's go.

7842
04:33:25,490 --> 04:33:25,830
Let's go.

7843
04:33:25,950 --> 04:33:27,170
Better than Ryanair already.

7844
04:33:27,370 --> 04:33:28,030
Give it up, chat.

7845
04:33:28,310 --> 04:33:30,090
For our two amazing contestants.

7846
04:33:30,730 --> 04:33:31,350
Let's go!

7847
04:33:32,450 --> 04:33:33,510
I'm so excited.

7848
04:33:36,250 --> 04:33:38,930
I'm really curious if we're gonna get fired, Snuffy.

7849
04:33:39,110 --> 04:33:39,950
How do you think we're gonna do tonight?

7850
04:33:40,310 --> 04:33:41,970
Okay, I'm literally right behind you.

7851
04:33:42,030 --> 04:33:42,970
I'm giving you the shots.

7852
04:33:43,430 --> 04:33:44,750
Why are we kissing?

7853
04:33:44,870 --> 04:33:46,250
I don't know!

7854
04:33:47,610 --> 04:33:48,730
What do you mean?

7855
04:33:50,730 --> 04:33:51,610
Alright, here we go.

7856
04:33:51,690 --> 04:33:56,730
The following contest is scheduled for one fall!

7857
04:33:58,110 --> 04:33:59,070
The following contest is scheduled for one fall!

7858
04:33:59,070 --> 04:33:59,210
The following contest is scheduled for one fall!

7859
04:33:59,570 --> 04:34:03,490
Representing Sarah, No one can win.

7860
04:34:03,490 --> 04:34:11,930
Another than the biggest, the meanest, the greenest, BULK!

7861
04:34:13,850 --> 04:34:14,250
BULK!

7862
04:34:14,590 --> 04:34:14,990
BULK!

7863
04:34:14,990 --> 04:34:15,250
BULK!

7864
04:34:18,780 --> 04:34:19,580
Holy Frick!

7865
04:34:19,620 --> 04:34:20,140
This guy's insane!

7866
04:34:20,340 --> 04:34:21,460
Where'd you find this dude?

7867
04:34:21,740 --> 04:34:22,980
An absolute legend.

7868
04:34:26,240 --> 04:34:28,020
Is there supposed to be like an intro music?

7869
04:34:28,140 --> 04:34:28,860
Should we make it up?

7870
04:34:29,600 --> 04:34:31,280
I think there probably is intro music.

7871
04:34:32,280 --> 04:34:33,300
Okay, now we can hear it.

7872
04:34:33,320 --> 04:34:33,760
There she is.

7873
04:34:35,300 --> 04:34:36,080
Bob Logan!

7874
04:34:39,000 --> 04:34:39,520
Oh!

7875
04:34:41,420 --> 04:34:42,320
She's beautiful.

7876
04:34:42,900 --> 04:34:45,360
Looks like she crawled out of a sarcophagus in Egypt.

7877
04:34:45,540 --> 04:34:47,740
I mean, this is eccentric to say the least.

7878
04:34:48,180 --> 04:34:48,900
You know what?

7879
04:34:48,920 --> 04:34:50,720
Looks like she might corrode you.

7880
04:34:50,920 --> 04:34:52,140
She's radioactive.

7881
04:34:53,000 --> 04:34:55,460
She kinda looks like she's wearing Peter Griffin's outfit.

7882
04:34:55,600 --> 04:34:56,240
I'm not gonna lie.

7883
04:34:56,400 --> 04:34:58,060
She comes here ready for combat.

7884
04:34:58,980 --> 04:35:00,020
Hey, yo!

7885
04:35:00,980 --> 04:35:03,380
These chiseled features don't lie.

7886
04:35:04,520 --> 04:35:05,220
She looks like she's wearing Peter Griffin's outfit.

7887
04:35:05,240 --> 04:35:06,400
She looks like a superhero.

7888
04:35:06,860 --> 04:35:08,700
Oh, she's unleashing the beast!

7889
04:35:10,300 --> 04:35:17,660
Call her a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle because this radioactive person is transforming the beast!

7890
04:35:19,800 --> 04:35:20,780
My god!

7891
04:35:20,900 --> 04:35:24,900
She's striking more poses than an effing Naruto hitting the effing fireball jutsu.

7892
04:35:25,100 --> 04:35:26,560
I don't know what she's doing.

7893
04:35:28,200 --> 04:35:30,860
We definitely gotta pay our camera guy a little bit more money.

7894
04:35:30,940 --> 04:35:31,760
Alright, let's go!

7895
04:35:31,760 --> 04:35:32,440
Woo woo woo!

7896
04:35:33,120 --> 04:35:34,220
Bulk Bogan!

7897
04:35:34,980 --> 04:35:38,160
Sir Ra is already putting on a show, ladies and gentlemen.

7898
04:35:41,300 --> 04:35:45,320
Business casual, but yet so fierce and wild.

7899
04:35:46,080 --> 04:35:48,260
Will we see her perform in the ring today?

7900
04:35:48,640 --> 04:35:50,400
Will we see the beast come out?

7901
04:35:50,700 --> 04:35:51,260
She's taking a dump.

7902
04:35:53,020 --> 04:35:55,140
It's all part of that wild nature.

7903
04:35:55,620 --> 04:35:57,240
Ooh, here comes the entrance?

7904
04:35:57,520 --> 04:35:57,880
Dang!

7905
04:35:58,640 --> 04:36:00,400
A little saucy with it.

7906
04:36:01,760 --> 04:36:03,560
It does look like she's fleeing a little bit of a zesty approach.

7907
04:36:03,600 --> 04:36:03,960
Ooh!

7908
04:36:03,960 --> 04:36:04,660
Oh my god!

7909
04:36:05,500 --> 04:36:09,060
We're holding the ropes like we're making sweet love to it.

7910
04:36:10,640 --> 04:36:11,120
We're holding the ropes like we're making sweet love to it.

7911
04:36:11,120 --> 04:36:11,840
And she's in.

7912
04:36:12,460 --> 04:36:14,600
I mean, this person's an actual fiend.

7913
04:36:14,640 --> 04:36:17,100
I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit worried for Doki right now.

7914
04:36:17,240 --> 04:36:17,500
I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit worried for Doki right now.

7915
04:36:17,500 --> 04:36:20,040
This person seems a little bit unhinged, to say the least.

7916
04:36:20,280 --> 04:36:24,540
Yeah, this person is a caged animal ready to be unleashed at any given moment.

7917
04:36:24,620 --> 04:36:30,200
We actually have 911 responders in the back with tasers and, uh...

7918
04:36:30,980 --> 04:36:31,460
equipment.

7919
04:36:31,760 --> 04:36:36,500
I'm getting unnamed equipment just in case it gets too feral.

7920
04:36:36,580 --> 04:36:38,960
She's been known to go absolutely hog wild.

7921
04:36:39,700 --> 04:36:41,200
Yoki might not make it today.

7922
04:36:41,760 --> 04:36:44,520
Speaking about Quip, I think she's looking pretty good in that department.

7923
04:36:44,680 --> 04:36:47,760
Let's see how she does!

7924
04:36:48,120 --> 04:36:49,300
I don't know, man.

7925
04:36:49,580 --> 04:36:52,560
This person's like peak Darwin evolution right now.

7926
04:36:52,720 --> 04:36:53,880
Sarah is looking insane.

7927
04:36:56,300 --> 04:36:59,640
I think she was bred solely just for her muscle compatibility.

7928
04:37:00,120 --> 04:37:01,440
Look how built she is.

7929
04:37:01,440 --> 04:37:03,080
Look at this pure primal nature.

7930
04:37:03,360 --> 04:37:06,180
She's currently seeking and sensing her prey.

7931
04:37:07,160 --> 04:37:08,340
That's true, Blaine.

7932
04:37:08,620 --> 04:37:10,080
Introducing her opponent!

7933
04:37:15,340 --> 04:37:17,320
Everybody knows the word!

7934
04:37:22,340 --> 04:37:22,900
YOKI!

7935
04:37:37,400 --> 04:37:38,520
Holy freak!

7936
04:37:38,560 --> 04:37:41,020
This man's got the vocal capacity of an whale.

7937
04:37:41,440 --> 04:37:42,020
That's insane.

7938
04:37:42,300 --> 04:37:43,240
And he is!

7939
04:37:43,240 --> 04:37:45,420
Here's our next challenger of the night!

7940
04:37:45,740 --> 04:37:48,220
Alright, it's such a pleasure to cast her match.

7941
04:37:48,480 --> 04:37:48,560
The King.

7942
04:37:49,700 --> 04:37:52,660
We just witnessed an amazing fight by the King.

7943
04:37:52,800 --> 04:37:56,220
And now we're about to watch if she will bring it back another time.

7944
04:37:56,340 --> 04:38:01,420
But she's versus an opponent who is just as fierce and feral as Doh King himself.

7945
04:38:02,060 --> 04:38:03,700
This is going to be quite intense.

7946
04:38:04,060 --> 04:38:05,700
I do have a question for you, Snuffy.

7947
04:38:05,800 --> 04:38:07,120
Do you think she's going to take off the mask?

7948
04:38:07,980 --> 04:38:08,740
I don't...

7949
04:38:08,740 --> 04:38:08,960
Oh!

7950
04:38:09,100 --> 04:38:10,420
I thought she might have just done it.

7951
04:38:10,460 --> 04:38:11,380
A rare mask reveal.

7952
04:38:11,380 --> 04:38:13,780
There's only three of them sold on eBay right now.

7953
04:38:14,140 --> 04:38:14,720
That's true.

7954
04:38:14,840 --> 04:38:15,240
That's true.

7955
04:38:15,300 --> 04:38:17,100
Things were never the same after the dream mask reveal.

7956
04:38:17,280 --> 04:38:19,140
So we're going to see if she keeps us on or not.

7957
04:38:19,240 --> 04:38:21,620
But she is making her way down the arena right now.

7958
04:38:22,480 --> 04:38:23,960
Slamming her head on the metal stairs.

7959
04:38:24,540 --> 04:38:26,520
Do you think you're allowed to use that in combat here or not?

7960
04:38:26,720 --> 04:38:28,140
I want to see some steel steel gameplay.

7961
04:38:28,620 --> 04:38:29,600
There are no rules in wrestling.

7962
04:38:29,800 --> 04:38:32,640
This is just pure wild animalistic fighting.

7963
04:38:33,580 --> 04:38:34,760
Yeah, you can say that again.

7964
04:38:34,880 --> 04:38:37,420
I mean, it's the f'ing Jaguar versus Serp matchup.

7965
04:38:37,540 --> 04:38:38,900
I mean, Slytherin or Hufflepuff.

7966
04:38:38,980 --> 04:38:39,940
Who's going to win this one?

7967
04:38:40,060 --> 04:38:40,960
Wait, Gryffindor?

7968
04:38:41,080 --> 04:38:41,360
I'm going to win this one.

7969
04:38:41,380 --> 04:38:41,820
I don't know what I'm saying.

7970
04:38:42,680 --> 04:38:43,120
Anyway...

7971
04:38:43,800 --> 04:38:45,200
I don't know bro.

7972
04:38:45,260 --> 04:38:46,400
I didn't watch the book, okay?

7973
04:38:46,780 --> 04:38:49,160
So we're going to see how she can do here tonight.

7974
04:38:49,780 --> 04:38:51,380
Wait, can we talk to chat?

7975
04:38:51,640 --> 04:38:54,060
Can we read our commentators what the fans are saying live?

7976
04:38:55,660 --> 04:38:56,620
I'm kind of curious.

7977
04:38:56,720 --> 04:38:57,540
Am I breaking the immersion?

7978
04:38:57,840 --> 04:38:58,460
Let's find out.

7979
04:38:58,460 --> 04:38:58,800
I'm getting worried.

7980
04:38:59,160 --> 04:38:59,760
I'm getting worried.

7981
04:38:59,860 --> 04:39:05,100
There's a lot of people in the crowd whispering my ears simultaneously at all a very condensed volume.

7982
04:39:05,840 --> 04:39:07,300
Watch the book, they say.

7983
04:39:07,760 --> 04:39:09,740
Oh, that's a weird quote.

7984
04:39:09,920 --> 04:39:10,900
Oh my gosh.

7985
04:39:10,900 --> 04:39:12,380
She goes straight up in the suplex.

7986
04:39:12,500 --> 04:39:16,780
I mean, the 49ers are about to draft this chick and she's going and grabbing a doge bird.

7987
04:39:16,840 --> 04:39:18,120
Throwing her straight into the railing.

7988
04:39:18,400 --> 04:39:19,580
Oh my god!

7989
04:39:19,720 --> 04:39:20,400
What was that move?

7990
04:39:20,700 --> 04:39:22,380
She hit the butt slam with that anime.

7991
04:39:23,000 --> 04:39:25,240
She did the peach sidebite.

7992
04:39:26,320 --> 04:39:27,780
Oh my god.

7993
04:39:28,200 --> 04:39:30,660
Joki is not starting her match very strongly.

7994
04:39:30,740 --> 04:39:33,460
She has spent more time on the floor than her feet on the ground.

7995
04:39:34,480 --> 04:39:35,960
I mean, she might be a wobble fit.

7996
04:39:36,080 --> 04:39:37,820
We'll have to see if she's a weight bloomer in this situation.

7997
04:39:38,220 --> 04:39:39,140
Oh, my god!

7998
04:39:39,280 --> 04:39:39,820
What is this?

7999
04:39:39,880 --> 04:39:40,880
Oh, she's just getting her ass kicked.

8000
04:39:40,900 --> 04:39:43,080
The whole body Circus Olade over here.

8001
04:39:43,500 --> 04:39:46,180
The spider monkey maneuver didn't work out that well for Sarah.

8002
04:39:46,420 --> 04:39:47,740
Now Doki Bird with the reversal.

8003
04:39:47,960 --> 04:39:48,920
She might have the upper hand.

8004
04:39:49,060 --> 04:39:49,500
Just kidding.

8005
04:39:49,620 --> 04:39:51,240
She's getting jokered by the courtes.

8006
04:39:51,240 --> 04:39:53,760
This is that kind of animalistic nature I told you about.

8007
04:39:53,860 --> 04:39:55,780
Once she's unleashed, there is no going back.

8008
04:39:55,940 --> 04:39:57,940
We will have to... Oh my god, Doki!

8009
04:39:58,180 --> 04:40:00,800
I mean, we went with the fatality in the first few seconds.

8010
04:40:00,920 --> 04:40:02,100
She's breaking her hands.

8011
04:40:03,000 --> 04:40:04,040
She's going for the throat.

8012
04:40:04,360 --> 04:40:08,800
Rather than take her ability to win this fight, she's ruining her ability to win an Apex game.

8013
04:40:09,060 --> 04:40:10,360
Doki is on the run.

8014
04:40:10,360 --> 04:40:13,900
She is currently hiding and screaming, begging for life right now.

8015
04:40:14,000 --> 04:40:16,060
She is too afraid to sit back in the ring.

8016
04:40:16,240 --> 04:40:17,500
She's... Oh, the eagle kick!

8017
04:40:17,680 --> 04:40:19,900
The eagle kick of the seventh condor.

8018
04:40:20,040 --> 04:40:21,740
Oh my god, I never...

8019
04:40:22,200 --> 04:40:24,600
Jesus Christ, she goes for the back of the head slam.

8020
04:40:24,940 --> 04:40:26,160
I... What just happened?

8021
04:40:27,220 --> 04:40:28,940
Doki just rage quit the game.

8022
04:40:29,020 --> 04:40:30,560
I repeat, Doki...

8023
04:40:32,120 --> 04:40:33,140
Is the stream paused?

8024
04:40:33,380 --> 04:40:34,480
I think the stream is paused, Doki.

8025
04:40:34,800 --> 04:40:37,560
But we're live on a five second delay.

8026
04:40:37,660 --> 04:40:39,560
I'm sure they're actually killing each other right now.

8027
04:40:39,940 --> 04:40:40,960
They are, they are.

8028
04:40:41,020 --> 04:40:42,280
Doki had to take this off camera.

8029
04:40:42,400 --> 04:40:44,640
This can no longer be broadcasted onto live TV.

8030
04:40:44,780 --> 04:40:46,720
We had to go to the backstage cameras right now.

8031
04:40:46,780 --> 04:40:48,940
Doki is currently grabbing her by the hair.

8032
04:40:49,240 --> 04:40:50,820
Oh, she's getting... Oh my god.

8033
04:40:50,880 --> 04:40:52,320
This is truly any man's game.

8034
04:40:52,540 --> 04:40:53,620
All the rules are broken.

8035
04:40:54,600 --> 04:40:55,520
They're getting back in the ring.

8036
04:40:55,580 --> 04:40:57,940
Back in the stadium, I mean, there's high ground versus low ground.

8037
04:40:58,020 --> 04:41:00,920
We saw this worked out in Star Wars, but Doki Bird also did see that.

8038
04:41:00,980 --> 04:41:02,820
So she is coming back into the arena now.

8039
04:41:03,600 --> 04:41:05,560
We are on a five minute round on the ground.

8040
04:41:06,000 --> 04:41:09,320
I'm predicting Doki will now turn it around with a 360 kick.

8041
04:41:09,320 --> 04:41:10,640
Spin off the rails.

8042
04:41:11,420 --> 04:41:12,420
That's probably what's happening.

8043
04:41:13,040 --> 04:41:15,100
Oh my god, that's exactly what happened.

8044
04:41:16,380 --> 04:41:18,720
And Sarah said Doki right over.

8045
04:41:19,620 --> 04:41:21,720
Doki is kicking her in the jaw.

8046
04:41:21,860 --> 04:41:23,340
Now she's grabbing her by the toes.

8047
04:41:23,560 --> 04:41:25,300
Yeah, she's grabbing her toes and everything.

8048
04:41:25,300 --> 04:41:26,420
We're live on television again.

8049
04:41:26,500 --> 04:41:27,100
We're live on television.

8050
04:41:27,100 --> 04:41:28,280
We are so back in real time.

8051
04:41:28,360 --> 04:41:30,080
It looks like she's hitting it with a Muffler 3000.

8052
04:41:30,720 --> 04:41:33,440
And Sarah is literally not feeling it this time.

8053
04:41:33,620 --> 04:41:35,060
She keeps grabbing her feet.

8054
04:41:35,120 --> 04:41:37,460
I'm starting to think there's a little bit... again.

8055
04:41:37,760 --> 04:41:38,700
Oh my god.

8056
04:41:38,700 --> 04:41:39,300
This might be more.

8057
04:41:39,300 --> 04:41:40,320
She's motivated by some odd...

8058
04:41:40,320 --> 04:41:41,960
She doesn't even...

8059
04:41:41,960 --> 04:41:42,660
Oh my god.

8060
04:41:42,940 --> 04:41:43,860
Four kicks.

8061
04:41:44,180 --> 04:41:46,340
Imagine how many testicles would have been lost just now.

8062
04:41:46,780 --> 04:41:48,000
Has to be in pieces already.

8063
04:41:48,220 --> 04:41:48,640
Oh!

8064
04:41:48,700 --> 04:41:51,500
She just grabbed her by the left cheek.

8065
04:41:51,700 --> 04:41:53,560
And then she just snapped her own neck.

8066
04:41:53,920 --> 04:41:55,080
Snapped her own neck.

8067
04:41:55,260 --> 04:41:56,220
That was insane.

8068
04:41:56,820 --> 04:41:59,280
And Sarah said, not today, bitch.

8069
04:41:59,300 --> 04:42:00,480
Oh my... incredible.

8070
04:42:00,840 --> 04:42:01,960
Drop kick with the phlegm spray.

8071
04:42:02,080 --> 04:42:03,420
I mean, this is getting violent.

8072
04:42:03,620 --> 04:42:05,120
I mean, this is just...

8073
04:42:05,940 --> 04:42:07,740
There's fluids everywhere at this point.

8074
04:42:08,040 --> 04:42:09,020
Fluids all over.

8075
04:42:10,040 --> 04:42:10,920
Wait, she's going for the tryout.

8076
04:42:10,920 --> 04:42:11,800
Oh my god, she's got her.

8077
04:42:11,880 --> 04:42:12,520
This could be it.

8078
04:42:12,960 --> 04:42:14,000
It's the first one already.

8079
04:42:14,060 --> 04:42:15,160
It's just Kuroi in the match.

8080
04:42:15,180 --> 04:42:16,700
There's no way Doki goes down without a fight.

8081
04:42:16,840 --> 04:42:18,120
She's kneeling on the back of that.

8082
04:42:18,160 --> 04:42:18,800
It takes three!

8083
04:42:20,100 --> 04:42:22,200
She's got that jaguar prowl.

8084
04:42:23,000 --> 04:42:24,100
Oh my god.

8085
04:42:24,100 --> 04:42:26,120
That was like Keiso landing on Jinxy.

8086
04:42:26,200 --> 04:42:27,800
I mean, I think she might be dead.

8087
04:42:27,940 --> 04:42:29,520
Oh my god.

8088
04:42:30,340 --> 04:42:31,220
Sarah's not done yet.

8089
04:42:32,200 --> 04:42:33,820
She's about to show us the true nature.

8090
04:42:34,120 --> 04:42:36,060
Her anaconda don't want nothing less.

8091
04:42:36,100 --> 04:42:37,280
Doki's got a bunch of them.

8092
04:42:37,520 --> 04:42:37,540
Oh!

8093
04:42:39,200 --> 04:42:39,600
Okay.

8094
04:42:39,700 --> 04:42:42,620
I don't think it was a very effective maneuver, but it did look swag-tastic.

8095
04:42:42,760 --> 04:42:43,420
I'm not gonna lie.

8096
04:42:44,760 --> 04:42:47,600
Maybe we can count on the snake to save Sarah after all.

8097
04:42:47,720 --> 04:42:48,940
Is that a spinning back kick?

8098
04:42:49,020 --> 04:42:50,140
Oh my god.

8099
04:42:50,560 --> 04:42:50,980
Crab Stomper!

8100
04:42:51,260 --> 04:42:52,540
Crab Stomper, Doki!

8101
04:42:52,820 --> 04:42:53,840
For the content!

8102
04:42:54,500 --> 04:42:56,080
She's just letting her get back up.

8103
04:42:56,220 --> 04:42:57,980
No, Doki's just toying with her.

8104
04:42:58,060 --> 04:42:59,240
Oh my god.

8105
04:42:59,380 --> 04:43:00,200
She's the king.

8106
04:43:02,260 --> 04:43:03,560
Oh my god!

8107
04:43:04,160 --> 04:43:07,260
She's tossing it around like a five-year-old playing with a Barbie doll.

8108
04:43:07,320 --> 04:43:08,720
She's just flinging her around.

8109
04:43:08,720 --> 04:43:08,940
Oh my god!

8110
04:43:08,940 --> 04:43:09,160
Oh!

8111
04:43:09,160 --> 04:43:09,700
Jesus Christ!

8112
04:43:09,780 --> 04:43:11,660
And the legendary triple suplex!

8113
04:43:11,920 --> 04:43:13,600
This might be it, ladies and gentlemen.

8114
04:43:13,620 --> 04:43:15,520
I mean, we're getting angles for sure.

8115
04:43:15,780 --> 04:43:16,120
Oh!

8116
04:43:17,620 --> 04:43:19,980
Sarah can still fight.

8117
04:43:20,340 --> 04:43:20,860
Unbelievable.

8118
04:43:21,220 --> 04:43:24,280
After being tossed around like a Gmod ragdoll.

8119
04:43:25,140 --> 04:43:29,620
We're moving straight out of leg pin land straight into face knee city.

8120
04:43:29,960 --> 04:43:30,300
Oh my lord.

8121
04:43:30,300 --> 04:43:34,200
I don't think Sarah's got much left in the tank at this point, but Doki Bird misses a knee.

8122
04:43:34,340 --> 04:43:35,920
The crotch sniff of five thousand.

8123
04:43:36,100 --> 04:43:36,620
I know.

8124
04:43:36,740 --> 04:43:37,120
I know.

8125
04:43:42,570 --> 04:43:43,210
Oh my god!

8126
04:43:43,370 --> 04:43:45,030
She's got him in the crab lock!

8127
04:43:45,490 --> 04:43:48,850
Oh my god!

8128
04:43:49,330 --> 04:43:50,550
This is insane!

8129
04:43:51,390 --> 04:43:52,330
This is insane!

8130
04:43:52,970 --> 04:43:54,950
And now Sarah's turned to gloat.

8131
04:43:55,970 --> 04:43:58,890
This has just become an illusion of fighting.

8132
04:43:59,090 --> 04:44:02,090
They are just... I think they're all just pure adrenaline at this point.

8133
04:44:02,450 --> 04:44:03,010
Whoa!

8134
04:44:03,850 --> 04:44:04,830
Out of nowhere!

8135
04:44:04,830 --> 04:44:06,410
Doki could not fight back.

8136
04:44:06,430 --> 04:44:07,170
Doki taps out!

8137
04:44:07,670 --> 04:44:08,170
Taps out!

8138
04:44:08,470 --> 04:44:09,010
Just like that!

8139
04:44:09,030 --> 04:44:12,110
Here's your winner by tap out!

8140
04:44:15,190 --> 04:44:15,910
Representing Sarah...

8141
04:44:17,870 --> 04:44:18,230
BALLS!

8142
04:44:19,850 --> 04:44:20,210
BALLGUN!

8143
04:44:21,950 --> 04:44:23,010
And they have a snake!

8144
04:44:23,190 --> 04:44:23,590
Oh my god!

8145
04:44:23,650 --> 04:44:23,910
They have a snake!

8146
04:44:24,910 --> 04:44:26,090
She's got the fucking snake!

8147
04:44:26,330 --> 04:44:27,690
Oh my god!

8148
04:44:27,770 --> 04:44:28,590
We get the snake!

8149
04:44:28,650 --> 04:44:30,270
No you can't bring the snake on here!

8150
04:44:30,450 --> 04:44:31,930
Who said you could bring the snake in here?

8151
04:44:33,010 --> 04:44:34,750
Someone get the trink!

8152
04:44:34,790 --> 04:44:35,310
Someone get the trink!

8153
04:44:35,310 --> 04:44:36,410
This cannot be legal!

8154
04:44:36,490 --> 04:44:37,110
We need the staff!

8155
04:44:37,170 --> 04:44:38,230
Staff on the stage now!

8156
04:44:38,410 --> 04:44:38,830
Staff!

8157
04:44:40,030 --> 04:44:42,030
I know Drake was going to be making a guest appearance.

8158
04:44:42,230 --> 04:44:42,730
That's crazy!

8159
04:44:43,050 --> 04:44:47,330
But dude, I did not expect Doki Bird to tap out in the final moments.

8160
04:44:47,410 --> 04:44:48,930
That was a really unexpected ending.

8161
04:44:49,330 --> 04:44:50,650
It was any man's game.

8162
04:44:50,790 --> 04:44:52,530
They were practically both out of stamina.

8163
04:44:52,750 --> 04:44:55,710
It just became just teeth and claw at that point.

8164
04:44:56,010 --> 04:44:57,290
I know, I know.

8165
04:44:57,450 --> 04:44:59,690
You know, Sarah might have hit it with a snake venom attack.

8166
04:44:59,850 --> 04:45:01,930
And it took down her stamina over the course of the fight.

8167
04:45:02,130 --> 04:45:05,250
Yeah, she got that Medusa glare and put Doki down.

8168
04:45:05,930 --> 04:45:10,990
I don't get the flag for casting a game where Doki got eliminated, but hey, we're back with her right now.

8169
04:45:11,110 --> 04:45:12,410
That was a fight!

8170
04:45:12,630 --> 04:45:13,770
I can explain.

8171
04:45:14,330 --> 04:45:15,290
Tell us about it.

8172
04:45:16,390 --> 04:45:19,750
Axel introduced me to this app called VINETS.

8173
04:45:19,790 --> 04:45:24,170
And I got a little bit addicted there.

8174
04:45:24,530 --> 04:45:29,610
So I might have lost a fight, but end up a millionaire.

8175
04:45:29,750 --> 04:45:31,270
So that's fine with me.

8176
04:45:31,390 --> 04:45:31,910
Damn.

8177
04:45:35,250 --> 04:45:35,770
That's it.

8178
04:45:35,770 --> 04:45:36,530
That's really it.

8179
04:45:36,670 --> 04:45:43,110
I won't say it was rigged, but I got a hefty amount of cash coming in soon.

8180
04:45:44,490 --> 04:45:46,190
Sarah, your response to this?

8181
04:45:47,130 --> 04:45:52,110
All I gotta say is, it's like they say in wrestling, sooner or later, everyone taps.

8182
04:45:52,350 --> 04:45:53,650
And today it was Doki.

8183
04:45:53,810 --> 04:45:55,290
So, sorry.

8184
04:45:55,510 --> 04:45:57,550
Got Doki in the chokie and it happened.

8185
04:45:57,770 --> 04:45:58,290
Oh yeah.

8186
04:45:58,370 --> 04:45:59,250
Not rigged.

8187
04:45:59,250 --> 04:46:00,090
Not rigged.

8188
04:46:03,910 --> 04:46:04,870
Oh god.

8189
04:46:05,250 --> 04:46:07,570
I can't believe it actually happened.

8190
04:46:10,130 --> 04:46:11,890
Doki in the chokie.

8191
04:46:13,450 --> 04:46:15,270
Wait, it actually happened.

8192
04:46:15,310 --> 04:46:17,230
Yeah, the finishing move, right?

8193
04:46:17,670 --> 04:46:18,150
Yeah.

8194
04:46:19,830 --> 04:46:20,610
What's his name?

8195
04:46:20,610 --> 04:46:21,610
Can you tell us how you...

8196
04:46:21,610 --> 04:46:23,510
Yeah, what's your snake name?

8197
04:46:23,890 --> 04:46:26,070
My snake name is Jin.

8198
04:46:26,330 --> 04:46:27,910
But I mean, like, okay.

8199
04:46:27,950 --> 04:46:32,050
So like, the reason that my wrestle looks the way it is, is because we're like a package deal.

8200
04:46:32,130 --> 04:46:34,250
But since there's two of us, we would have got DQ'd.

8201
04:46:34,250 --> 04:46:37,110
If we went in together.

8202
04:46:37,450 --> 04:46:42,670
So we did a fusion dance and the abomination that is Wolf-Burgen is a mixture of me and my snake.

8203
04:46:43,410 --> 04:46:46,250
But then what is left over is the snake in the back.

8204
04:46:48,270 --> 04:46:49,310
And the remainder.

8205
04:46:50,090 --> 04:46:52,590
I don't know a snake barista could be so buff.

8206
04:46:52,910 --> 04:46:54,410
You guys are like the Wonder Twins.

8207
04:46:55,610 --> 04:46:56,050
Yes!

8208
04:46:58,570 --> 04:47:00,630
That's what they do call us in the streets.

8209
04:47:00,750 --> 04:47:00,810
Wait, that's a fish!

8210
04:47:00,810 --> 04:47:01,710
That's two people!

8211
04:47:03,130 --> 04:47:03,710
I'm one!

8212
04:47:03,710 --> 04:47:05,290
This is not fair!

8213
04:47:05,570 --> 04:47:07,270
No, you have a tomato in you.

8214
04:47:08,590 --> 04:47:10,230
Don't you have a tomato in you?

8215
04:47:10,370 --> 04:47:10,810
It's a fucking...

8216
04:47:11,450 --> 04:47:12,270
It's a cosmetic!

8217
04:47:12,870 --> 04:47:15,430
It's not like I have a second person.

8218
04:47:16,890 --> 04:47:19,070
It's like me putting on a fucking hat.

8219
04:47:19,130 --> 04:47:20,610
Which I am wearing one too.

8220
04:47:20,770 --> 04:47:22,090
So it's like wearing two hats.

8221
04:47:22,490 --> 04:47:24,690
I feel like it's like you and your eyebrows.

8222
04:47:25,050 --> 04:47:26,810
Like imagine if you didn't have your eyebrows.

8223
04:47:26,910 --> 04:47:28,510
Would you be half the Doki you are?

8224
04:47:28,730 --> 04:47:30,990
I feel like you would be missing a whole part of yourself.

8225
04:47:33,710 --> 04:47:34,770
I just think you know what?

8226
04:47:35,590 --> 04:47:36,770
Okay, all right, fine.

8227
04:47:36,970 --> 04:47:39,950
The better wrestler won.

8228
04:47:40,350 --> 04:47:42,510
I'll admit the better wrestler won.

8229
04:47:42,830 --> 04:47:43,870
You were an incredible opponent.

8230
04:47:45,470 --> 04:47:49,010
I'm going to take this whole thing out just to prove that you were one of the best.

8231
04:47:49,150 --> 04:47:49,750
Yeah, okay.

8232
04:47:49,750 --> 04:47:51,590
You got to win the finals then.

8233
04:47:51,690 --> 04:47:56,350
If you beat me and you win, that means I'm the winner too.

8234
04:47:56,510 --> 04:47:58,130
Because I lost to the winner.

8235
04:47:58,290 --> 04:47:59,570
So like technically I'm also the winner.

8236
04:47:59,570 --> 04:48:00,410
You're coming with me on this.

8237
04:48:00,470 --> 04:48:01,950
I'm taking you along for the ride.

8238
04:48:01,990 --> 04:48:02,290
It's okay.

8239
04:48:02,290 --> 04:48:03,050
Yeah, yeah.

8240
04:48:03,130 --> 04:48:03,390
I know.

8241
04:48:05,070 --> 04:48:06,070
Well, I'm...

8242
04:48:06,070 --> 04:48:06,110
All right.

8243
04:48:06,430 --> 04:48:06,930
Chat.

8244
04:48:07,570 --> 04:48:09,130
Doki Bird Watchers.

8245
04:48:09,230 --> 04:48:09,710
What is it?

8246
04:48:09,730 --> 04:48:10,970
Is it the Bird Watchers?

8247
04:48:10,970 --> 04:48:11,670
The Ruffians?

8248
04:48:12,030 --> 04:48:12,330
What?

8249
04:48:12,450 --> 04:48:14,510
Do you know this amazing fight we just witnessed?

8250
04:48:14,890 --> 04:48:15,490
Let's go!

8251
04:48:16,990 --> 04:48:20,190
You don't know my fans' names on my own channel?

8252
04:48:24,430 --> 04:48:26,830
Thank you to our viewers like you.

8253
04:48:27,370 --> 04:48:27,870
Oh!

8254
04:48:27,990 --> 04:48:28,150
Oh!

8255
04:48:29,110 --> 04:48:29,610
Oh!

8256
04:48:29,670 --> 04:48:30,170
Oh!

8257
04:48:30,170 --> 04:48:30,190
Oh!

8258
04:48:30,750 --> 04:48:31,250
Oh!

8259
04:48:32,290 --> 04:48:33,270
Which match is next?

8260
04:48:33,470 --> 04:48:35,770
Who's up to the chopping block now?

8261
04:48:35,890 --> 04:48:38,370
Well, I sure am going to know because I do know.

8262
04:48:38,610 --> 04:48:38,990
A clown!

8263
04:48:39,170 --> 04:48:39,510
It's...

8264
04:48:40,910 --> 04:48:41,350
Oh!

8265
04:48:43,290 --> 04:48:45,710
I sure wish I knew what I was doing.

8266
04:48:50,690 --> 04:48:51,570
A clown?

8267
04:48:52,150 --> 04:48:53,050
And then a...

8268
04:48:53,770 --> 04:48:54,210
Hello?

8269
04:48:54,770 --> 04:48:55,790
Yeah, that's me.

8270
04:48:55,810 --> 04:48:56,210
That's me.

8271
04:48:56,230 --> 04:48:56,670
I'm a clown.

8272
04:48:57,450 --> 04:48:57,890
Hi!

8273
04:48:58,090 --> 04:48:59,650
You better be funny!

8274
04:48:59,650 --> 04:49:00,050
Yes, you are.

8275
04:49:00,450 --> 04:49:01,230
Oh, I'm not.

8276
04:49:01,410 --> 04:49:01,710
Yes, you are.

8277
04:49:03,170 --> 04:49:06,570
Wait, wait, I didn't even introduce any professional, but I don't know who the names are.

8278
04:49:06,690 --> 04:49:07,470
Oh my god.

8279
04:49:07,850 --> 04:49:09,310
Okay, okay, I got this.

8280
04:49:09,870 --> 04:49:11,510
So I actually knew the entire time.

8281
04:49:11,570 --> 04:49:12,430
I would just pick truly.

8282
04:49:12,550 --> 04:49:13,330
Yeah, take your time.

8283
04:49:13,510 --> 04:49:16,310
Okay, so first off, we are going to introduce...

8284
04:49:17,250 --> 04:49:20,470
Okay, I just saw four different names, but one of them is definitely Octavio.

8285
04:49:20,670 --> 04:49:22,210
So what's up, Octavio?

8286
04:49:23,990 --> 04:49:24,350
Hello.

8287
04:49:25,670 --> 04:49:26,030
Badly.

8288
04:49:26,670 --> 04:49:27,570
Oh, hi, Octavio.

8289
04:49:29,230 --> 04:49:29,930
Sick, nasty.

8290
04:49:30,150 --> 04:49:31,430
Okay, wait, so which one's which?

8291
04:49:31,490 --> 04:49:32,130
I'm so sorry.

8292
04:49:32,370 --> 04:49:33,530
Yeah, you got it.

8293
04:49:33,530 --> 04:49:33,830
You got it.

8294
04:49:33,850 --> 04:49:34,290
Why don't you guess?

8295
04:49:34,370 --> 04:49:35,270
Guess, like, pick.

8296
04:49:35,290 --> 04:49:35,530
Pick.

8297
04:49:35,590 --> 04:49:38,330
Okay, Octavio is a clown or is he a boo man?

8298
04:49:38,510 --> 04:49:38,950
Let's see.

8299
04:49:39,110 --> 04:49:40,010
You have to pick.

8300
04:49:40,070 --> 04:49:40,530
You have to pick.

8301
04:49:40,570 --> 04:49:41,550
I'm going to guess.

8302
04:49:42,410 --> 04:49:44,170
Octavio sounds really effing quirked up.

8303
04:49:44,330 --> 04:49:45,090
I'm going to say he's the clown.

8304
04:49:45,970 --> 04:49:48,170
Yikes, yikes, yikes, yikes.

8305
04:49:51,810 --> 04:49:52,910
On live TV.

8306
04:49:55,090 --> 04:49:55,430
Okay.

8307
04:49:55,430 --> 04:49:57,330
Mr. Clown, is your name Charlie?

8308
04:49:57,570 --> 04:49:58,030
Oh, you're Bunny Chance?

8309
04:49:59,950 --> 04:50:00,270
Yeah.

8310
04:50:00,770 --> 04:50:01,170
Let's go.

8311
04:50:01,330 --> 04:50:02,070
Let's go, dude.

8312
04:50:02,650 --> 04:50:03,950
Hey, guys, Charlie here.

8313
04:50:07,150 --> 04:50:10,070
Well, Mr. Charlie, how does it feel to fight your co-hi?

8314
04:50:10,650 --> 04:50:11,570
Oh, man, it feels good.

8315
04:50:11,670 --> 04:50:12,070
It feels good.

8316
04:50:12,130 --> 04:50:14,830
It feels good to just... I'm going... I'm just going to wipe the floor with this guy.

8317
04:50:14,890 --> 04:50:16,190
He's got to be going, Octavio.

8318
04:50:16,350 --> 04:50:17,810
I'm going like, Octavio, oh, no.

8319
04:50:17,950 --> 04:50:20,150
Stop it, sexy clown man, for fucking hitting me in the head.

8320
04:50:21,210 --> 04:50:21,730
You're done.

8321
04:50:21,910 --> 04:50:22,110
Bettle?

8322
04:50:22,850 --> 04:50:23,170
Bettle?

8323
04:50:23,950 --> 04:50:24,890
I have to say something.

8324
04:50:24,990 --> 04:50:25,610
First off, I think you're cool.

8325
04:50:25,610 --> 04:50:25,730
Uh -huh.

8326
04:50:25,930 --> 04:50:26,490
It's Charlie.

8327
04:50:27,570 --> 04:50:28,170
I think you're handsome.

8328
04:50:28,610 --> 04:50:30,650
I think you're admirable.

8329
04:50:31,110 --> 04:50:32,170
I think you're inspirational.

8330
04:50:33,610 --> 04:50:34,130
Uh-huh.

8331
04:50:37,150 --> 04:50:37,530
Thanks.

8332
04:50:37,770 --> 04:50:38,330
Thank you.

8333
04:50:38,710 --> 04:50:40,270
Okay, I want to see some actual violence.

8334
04:50:40,290 --> 04:50:41,350
What the frick is this about?

8335
04:50:41,410 --> 04:50:42,730
Yeah, you just have to kiss him.

8336
04:50:43,410 --> 04:50:44,330
Yeah, like, what is this?

8337
04:50:44,350 --> 04:50:44,890
Go kiss at this point, man.

8338
04:50:44,890 --> 04:50:45,250
What the hell?

8339
04:50:45,370 --> 04:50:46,410
I did a name pun.

8340
04:50:46,530 --> 04:50:50,210
I worked like five... I practiced that for like five minutes before I got here.

8341
04:50:50,430 --> 04:50:52,350
Yeah, well, I hope you practiced that punch just as much.

8342
04:50:52,770 --> 04:50:53,650
You can do those in seconds.

8343
04:50:53,710 --> 04:50:57,230
Like, Bettle, well, you... Bettle not tell anybody.

8344
04:50:57,230 --> 04:50:59,210
But you're gonna die today.

8345
04:50:59,730 --> 04:51:00,870
What the hell?

8346
04:51:01,030 --> 04:51:01,810
What is this?

8347
04:51:02,150 --> 04:51:04,050
This is biased commentary.

8348
04:51:05,630 --> 04:51:07,370
You're supposed to remain neutral.

8349
04:51:08,350 --> 04:51:09,110
No, no.

8350
04:51:09,150 --> 04:51:09,690
See, it's weird.

8351
04:51:09,770 --> 04:51:10,830
It's good cop, bad cop.

8352
04:51:11,230 --> 04:51:13,410
Yeah, Philly already dunked on Octavia.

8353
04:51:13,490 --> 04:51:14,370
It's my turn now.

8354
04:51:14,610 --> 04:51:15,790
Philly called me Charlie.

8355
04:51:16,690 --> 04:51:17,950
Yeah, we're tagged even.

8356
04:51:18,150 --> 04:51:19,690
Wait, which one am I talking about?

8357
04:51:20,110 --> 04:51:21,290
Oh, my God.

8358
04:51:21,370 --> 04:51:22,310
Are you kidding me?

8359
04:51:22,310 --> 04:51:23,290
Do your research.

8360
04:51:24,010 --> 04:51:25,330
What is this?

8361
04:51:25,330 --> 04:51:26,570
I'm just kidding.

8362
04:51:26,690 --> 04:51:27,130
I'm just kidding.

8363
04:51:27,130 --> 04:51:27,510
I'm just kidding.

8364
04:51:27,610 --> 04:51:28,010
I'm just kidding.

8365
04:51:28,110 --> 04:51:28,350
Okay.

8366
04:51:28,470 --> 04:51:28,890
Okay.

8367
04:51:28,950 --> 04:51:29,750
You're just kidding.

8368
04:51:30,010 --> 04:51:33,070
Guys, tell me right now, what is your signature move?

8369
04:51:33,290 --> 04:51:36,110
What secret technique are you planning on using this match?

8370
04:51:37,610 --> 04:51:39,550
I'm gonna show Bettle my blue balls.

8371
04:51:40,030 --> 04:51:42,290
That's not on YouTube.

8372
04:51:43,590 --> 04:51:44,490
We're on YouTube.

8373
04:51:47,130 --> 04:51:50,050
My signature move is the open hand slap.

8374
04:51:51,570 --> 04:51:52,130
Dang.

8375
04:51:52,130 --> 04:51:52,950
A pimp.

8376
04:51:52,950 --> 04:51:54,150
I respect that.

8377
04:51:54,310 --> 04:51:54,870
Yeah.

8378
04:51:54,870 --> 04:51:54,870
Okay.

8379
04:51:54,870 --> 04:51:55,250
Oh, my gosh.

8380
04:51:55,310 --> 04:51:55,710
Okay.

8381
04:51:55,710 --> 04:51:56,030
Okay.

8382
04:51:56,810 --> 04:51:58,070
I mean, we'll see who wins.

8383
04:51:58,210 --> 04:51:59,170
Balls are slapping.

8384
04:51:59,170 --> 04:51:59,870
You're my senpai.

8385
04:51:59,890 --> 04:52:01,590
I can't disrespect you right now.

8386
04:52:03,130 --> 04:52:04,910
I'm gonna defile your body in the ring.

8387
04:52:05,190 --> 04:52:05,590
What?

8388
04:52:06,290 --> 04:52:06,690
Okay.

8389
04:52:06,790 --> 04:52:07,470
Oh, my God.

8390
04:52:07,710 --> 04:52:08,670
I think we should.

8391
04:52:08,730 --> 04:52:10,390
I'm sensing a lot of tension in this match.

8392
04:52:10,450 --> 04:52:11,270
I think we should.

8393
04:52:11,330 --> 04:52:12,410
We're good in a match.

8394
04:52:12,810 --> 04:52:13,490
I'm gonna go.

8395
04:52:13,690 --> 04:52:14,970
This is a strong rivalry.

8396
04:52:14,970 --> 04:52:15,730
Okay, Gavis brittle.

8397
04:52:16,450 --> 04:52:18,010
Yeah, I'm sensing some energy here.

8398
04:52:18,090 --> 04:52:18,770
It might be a little romantic.

8399
04:52:18,970 --> 04:52:19,730
I'm not gonna lie.

8400
04:52:21,570 --> 04:52:23,970
Well, I can't wait to see how this fight unfolds.

8401
04:52:25,750 --> 04:52:26,270
Slay.

8402
04:52:26,990 --> 04:52:27,730
All right.

8403
04:52:27,770 --> 04:52:29,610
Let's well to span figure 10, real time.

8404
04:52:30,390 --> 04:52:31,530
Let's get to it.

8405
04:52:34,400 --> 04:52:34,920
Okay.

8406
04:52:35,100 --> 04:52:36,240
What on earth?

8407
04:52:36,320 --> 04:52:38,420
What are those characters, bro?

8408
04:52:38,680 --> 04:52:42,720
They both are making insane expressions upon seeing one another.

8409
04:52:43,020 --> 04:52:45,560
I take a look at the two different directions.

8410
04:52:46,040 --> 04:52:46,520
The other one.

8411
04:52:46,520 --> 04:52:50,340
The other one is our final match for night one!

8412
04:52:54,160 --> 04:52:55,780
Introducing first, the Itaewon

8413
04:53:04,900 --> 04:53:06,920
That is a freaking wizard.

8414
04:53:07,080 --> 04:53:10,180
I know this dude definitely cast fireballs on the weekend.

8415
04:53:11,840 --> 04:53:13,580
he comes to the judgment.

8416
04:53:14,240 --> 04:53:16,020
What a beautiful eyeliner.

8417
04:53:16,540 --> 04:53:17,180
that would have been a beautiful eyeliner.

8418
04:53:17,180 --> 04:53:20,180
I really need the name of his makeup artist.

8419
04:53:20,400 --> 04:53:20,760
Okay.

8420
04:53:20,760 --> 04:53:21,780
He's got a doll.

8421
04:53:21,900 --> 04:53:22,640
I know.

8422
04:53:22,700 --> 04:53:25,300
I thought we would stop at body pillows, but apparently not.

8423
04:53:25,300 --> 04:53:27,280
Oh my god, that might be his sister, dude.

8424
04:53:27,760 --> 04:53:28,520
Yeah, it might be.

8425
04:53:28,560 --> 04:53:29,640
I bet it stands up on its own.

8426
04:53:29,740 --> 04:53:30,560
We'd have to find out.

8427
04:53:30,740 --> 04:53:33,080
So let's see what this man's got going on.

8428
04:53:33,240 --> 04:53:34,980
I mean, he's like a walking jellyfish.

8429
04:53:35,700 --> 04:53:36,600
He's kind of intense.

8430
04:53:36,980 --> 04:53:39,560
Oh my god, I can't look at this guy.

8431
04:53:42,040 --> 04:53:45,440
I think he might have meant to go to the rave next door, I'm not gonna lie to you.

8432
04:53:45,620 --> 04:53:47,220
I don't know if he knows this is wrestling.

8433
04:53:47,560 --> 04:53:50,360
This man looks like he paid 90 bucks for a six pack of water.

8434
04:53:50,520 --> 04:53:52,980
I mean, this dude's serious business right now.

8435
04:53:53,760 --> 04:53:56,780
I mean, does he know where the camera is?

8436
04:53:56,840 --> 04:53:58,420
I don't think this guy's looked away a single time.

8437
04:53:58,700 --> 04:54:02,000
I think we would all be better off if he would buy less avocado toast.

8438
04:54:02,920 --> 04:54:05,060
Dang, you just roasted an entire state.

8439
04:54:05,640 --> 04:54:06,320
That's crazy.

8440
04:54:07,580 --> 04:54:09,140
All right, he's rolling up.

8441
04:54:09,200 --> 04:54:09,580
Let's see.

8442
04:54:09,680 --> 04:54:11,200
They don't call him Octavio for nothing.

8443
04:54:12,220 --> 04:54:13,660
It kind of sounds like an emperor name.

8444
04:54:13,820 --> 04:54:14,580
What is his legacy?

8445
04:54:16,040 --> 04:54:16,900
Oh my god.

8446
04:54:17,780 --> 04:54:18,180
Yo!

8447
04:54:20,240 --> 04:54:22,900
I think they might be like a rock star maybe.

8448
04:54:22,900 --> 04:54:22,960
Yeah.

8449
04:54:22,980 --> 04:54:23,100
Maybe.

8450
04:54:23,100 --> 04:54:24,260
That's what the vibe I'm getting off.

8451
04:54:24,300 --> 04:54:26,080
He's a rock artist.

8452
04:54:26,360 --> 04:54:27,720
I think he's just an artist.

8453
04:54:27,760 --> 04:54:28,600
I'm not gonna lie.

8454
04:54:28,980 --> 04:54:28,980
Oh my god.

8455
04:54:28,980 --> 04:54:30,420
He's casting fire.

8456
04:54:31,540 --> 04:54:33,660
Someone in chat wrote Gandalf.

8457
04:54:36,160 --> 04:54:36,980
No, no, no, no.

8458
04:54:37,020 --> 04:54:38,240
It's Hatsune Miku.

8459
04:54:39,320 --> 04:54:39,640
True.

8460
04:54:41,580 --> 04:54:51,380
And his opponent, known as Charlie in some circles, has defeated his brother to be here.

8461
04:54:52,500 --> 04:54:53,300
It's Bello!

8462
04:55:00,980 --> 04:55:03,060
There's somebody with a frog on the stage.

8463
04:55:04,140 --> 04:55:05,520
He's already into the arena.

8464
04:55:05,680 --> 04:55:07,120
This man works fast as frick.

8465
04:55:07,300 --> 04:55:07,800
Oh my god.

8466
04:55:07,800 --> 04:55:09,320
Yeah, this guy is all about business.

8467
04:55:09,460 --> 04:55:10,400
He might be a clown.

8468
04:55:10,600 --> 04:55:12,820
He might be joking and funny and humorous.

8469
04:55:12,900 --> 04:55:14,400
But he's all about business here.

8470
04:55:14,700 --> 04:55:17,340
He looks like the type of guy to tip a razor blade to his shoe.

8471
04:55:17,520 --> 04:55:18,920
I don't trust him for a moment.

8472
04:55:19,120 --> 04:55:20,800
I mean this guy is... What's he got under that hat?

8473
04:55:20,800 --> 04:55:22,320
That's what I'm afraid of.

8474
04:55:22,440 --> 04:55:23,940
Wait, that was the shortest intro in history.

8475
04:55:24,200 --> 04:55:26,340
This dude's here for winning money and leaving.

8476
04:55:27,020 --> 04:55:28,700
I think that means he's ready to kill.

8477
04:55:29,160 --> 04:55:29,560
Yeah.

8478
04:55:29,840 --> 04:55:31,640
Alright, well, Bello versus Octavia.

8479
04:55:31,820 --> 04:55:32,820
Let's see how this one rolls out.

8480
04:55:32,840 --> 04:55:35,320
Why did he swap to an F-ing D-Word dress?

8481
04:55:35,700 --> 04:55:36,620
Will we see kissing?

8482
04:55:37,100 --> 04:55:37,920
Let's find out.

8483
04:55:38,320 --> 04:55:40,120
Oh my god!

8484
04:55:41,020 --> 04:55:43,580
We're about to see Tony Hawk pro skater kickflip.

8485
04:55:44,820 --> 04:55:46,780
Riding him like a freaking skateboard.

8486
04:55:47,120 --> 04:55:48,480
Okay, way to open up the match.

8487
04:55:48,600 --> 04:55:49,740
Oh, and he does it again!

8488
04:55:50,820 --> 04:55:53,480
I mean this dude's doing more flips than me right now.

8489
04:55:53,700 --> 04:55:55,200
Oh my god!

8490
04:55:55,480 --> 04:55:56,680
Oh my god!

8491
04:55:56,720 --> 04:55:57,520
Oh my god!

8492
04:56:00,880 --> 04:56:01,860
Okay, Octavia's out of the ring!

8493
04:56:01,860 --> 04:56:02,800
He just did a Beyblade.

8494
04:56:03,040 --> 04:56:04,560
No, wait, Octavia's already getting pinned.

8495
04:56:04,620 --> 04:56:04,700
He's gone.

8496
04:56:05,600 --> 04:56:06,720
Oh, Bello got tossed.

8497
04:56:06,800 --> 04:56:07,680
These guys are strong.

8498
04:56:07,680 --> 04:56:10,040
Somebody please get their grandpa back in the retirement home.

8499
04:56:10,200 --> 04:56:11,580
I don't think he's meant to be here.

8500
04:56:12,600 --> 04:56:13,080
Oh!

8501
04:56:13,680 --> 04:56:15,020
And just like that!

8502
04:56:15,200 --> 04:56:16,320
Oh my god!

8503
04:56:16,540 --> 04:56:17,100
He's back up!

8504
04:56:17,860 --> 04:56:18,340
Oh!

8505
04:56:18,340 --> 04:56:19,720
The triple backflip!

8506
04:56:19,740 --> 04:56:21,920
I hope grandpa didn't bring his dentures.

8507
04:56:22,680 --> 04:56:23,620
Bello's here to fight!

8508
04:56:23,700 --> 04:56:25,020
Oh my god!

8509
04:56:25,560 --> 04:56:28,760
He's flying around the match like a trapeze!

8510
04:56:28,760 --> 04:56:29,700
Octavia's dead already?

8511
04:56:30,180 --> 04:56:31,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

8512
04:56:31,540 --> 04:56:33,000
No, he's got more than this.

8513
04:56:33,040 --> 04:56:35,880
He's ready to show the world what he told us he was gonna do.

8514
04:56:36,120 --> 04:56:38,060
I think Octavia's already running for his life.

8515
04:56:38,140 --> 04:56:40,020
He might get knocked off the back rope right now.

8516
04:56:40,220 --> 04:56:45,160
My man missed his takedown maneuver and got head pinched into the... what?

8517
04:56:45,500 --> 04:56:47,200
He's blinded by the LEDs!

8518
04:56:47,800 --> 04:56:48,900
Oh my god!

8519
04:56:48,960 --> 04:56:49,360
Oh!

8520
04:56:49,360 --> 04:56:50,240
Oh my god!

8521
04:56:51,020 --> 04:56:56,180
The sheer amount of light reflection that Octavia's outfit is causing right now.

8522
04:56:56,580 --> 04:56:59,240
I know, he's blinded by the lights.

8523
04:56:59,840 --> 04:57:01,760
We can definitely get him a copyright.

8524
04:57:02,460 --> 04:57:03,020
True?

8525
04:57:03,460 --> 04:57:04,020
Wait.

8526
04:57:06,120 --> 04:57:07,960
The epic head slam!

8527
04:57:08,080 --> 04:57:11,400
The whiplash here is probably equivalent to a 60 mile an hour car crash.

8528
04:57:11,720 --> 04:57:13,280
We're not doing this going on!

8529
04:57:13,360 --> 04:57:16,400
That was the sickest move I have ever seen in all wrestling history.

8530
04:57:17,760 --> 04:57:19,340
That was the coolest thing.

8531
04:57:19,340 --> 04:57:20,300
That was the coolest thing I have ever witnessed.

8532
04:57:20,700 --> 04:57:24,100
Usually when guys do the helicopters by themselves, I mean this one's crazy.

8533
04:57:24,140 --> 04:57:28,180
I think we should hire clowns to fight more often because this is just getting sick.

8534
04:57:28,320 --> 04:57:31,860
I mean I think I'm watching a yaoi fold in real time, I'm not gonna lie.

8535
04:57:34,160 --> 04:57:36,060
Who's the semi and who's the...

8536
04:57:36,060 --> 04:57:37,080
This is the Johnny Appleseed.

8537
04:57:39,220 --> 04:57:39,780
Whoa!

8538
04:57:41,120 --> 04:57:42,140
Whoa my god!

8539
04:57:42,260 --> 04:57:42,820
Grandpa!

8540
04:57:42,820 --> 04:57:45,040
It's like a folding chair!

8541
04:57:45,800 --> 04:57:46,860
Holy shit!

8542
04:57:46,940 --> 04:57:47,440
Just kidding!

8543
04:57:47,860 --> 04:57:48,820
He's not...

8544
04:57:48,820 --> 04:57:49,600
Okay.

8545
04:57:50,100 --> 04:57:54,080
Betel is taking Octavio in literally any position he can get him in.

8546
04:57:54,180 --> 04:57:54,740
This is insane.

8547
04:57:55,060 --> 04:57:56,300
Oh my god!

8548
04:57:56,380 --> 04:57:59,800
How many backflips does he need before he's backflipped enough?

8549
04:58:00,140 --> 04:58:02,080
I think he's trying to impress you, Phil.

8550
04:58:02,740 --> 04:58:02,920
This is insane.

8551
04:58:02,920 --> 04:58:03,340
Is it true?

8552
04:58:03,780 --> 04:58:04,820
Oh my god!

8553
04:58:04,840 --> 04:58:05,800
Octavio's gonna take him from the top!

8554
04:58:05,860 --> 04:58:06,780
Oh my god!

8555
04:58:07,860 --> 04:58:09,180
Oh my god!

8556
04:58:09,920 --> 04:58:11,040
Oh my god!

8557
04:58:11,540 --> 04:58:14,240
I'm literally making love on the stage!

8558
04:58:15,480 --> 04:58:16,000
I cannot commentate on this right now!

8559
04:58:16,000 --> 04:58:18,360
That's half of the backflip and now his lutz are popped!

8560
04:58:18,820 --> 04:58:19,680
Oh my god!

8561
04:58:20,240 --> 04:58:21,340
Octavio's got him!

8562
04:58:21,500 --> 04:58:23,060
He's dealing with the epic door!

8563
04:58:23,300 --> 04:58:24,500
What is he doing?

8564
04:58:24,780 --> 04:58:27,340
He's showing the whole world his senpai.

8565
04:58:27,780 --> 04:58:29,940
He's just doing some damage all the time.

8566
04:58:29,940 --> 04:58:32,040
He's just getting fought like a banana.

8567
04:58:32,800 --> 04:58:33,400
Insane.

8568
04:58:33,820 --> 04:58:35,460
Oh my god!

8569
04:58:35,580 --> 04:58:39,630
Poor damage to himself.

8570
04:58:40,610 --> 04:58:40,910
Okay.

8571
04:58:41,630 --> 04:58:43,010
Oh my god!

8572
04:58:43,050 --> 04:58:45,370
They're just jumping off of each other at this point!

8573
04:58:45,510 --> 04:58:47,150
They're playing like leapfrog!

8574
04:58:48,430 --> 04:58:50,270
Oh right against the...

8575
04:58:50,270 --> 04:58:51,470
Oh my god!

8576
04:58:51,470 --> 04:58:52,290
This is getting dirty!

8577
04:58:53,890 --> 04:58:55,530
This is getting absolutely filthy!

8578
04:58:55,530 --> 04:58:57,330
She said not to worry about...

8579
04:58:57,330 --> 04:58:59,530
Neither of them look like they want to get back into the ring.

8580
04:58:59,630 --> 04:59:00,590
Oh my god!

8581
04:59:01,030 --> 04:59:01,810
This is it!

8582
04:59:04,820 --> 04:59:08,140
Wait, Snuff, don't forget you cannot pin outside of the arena.

8583
04:59:08,320 --> 04:59:11,220
So that means that currently Beto is safe from being eliminated.

8584
04:59:11,640 --> 04:59:14,160
Unless he's stunned until ten seconds runs out.

8585
04:59:14,420 --> 04:59:14,600
Unless he's stunned until ten seconds runs out.

8586
04:59:14,600 --> 04:59:15,360
It's almost there!

8587
04:59:15,440 --> 04:59:16,700
We've got seven seconds!

8588
04:59:17,140 --> 04:59:18,620
Beto doesn't get back in right now.

8589
04:59:18,800 --> 04:59:21,080
He's taunting and the other one's taunting!

8590
04:59:21,380 --> 04:59:23,760
He nearly timed out and he is taunting!

8591
04:59:24,280 --> 04:59:26,720
I'm not even sure if his head is screwed on straight anymore.

8592
04:59:26,980 --> 04:59:28,320
I don't think it ever was.

8593
04:59:28,460 --> 04:59:29,580
I mean this dude is tenacious.

8594
04:59:29,580 --> 04:59:30,720
He's an actual maniac.

8595
04:59:31,060 --> 04:59:33,080
I would not want to fight this guy.

8596
04:59:33,180 --> 04:59:33,980
Oh my god!

8597
04:59:34,620 --> 04:59:36,940
You hit him with the industrial head slicer.

8598
04:59:37,080 --> 04:59:39,380
I've seen that on a live place before.

8599
04:59:39,560 --> 04:59:41,340
And now I think...

8600
04:59:41,340 --> 04:59:42,360
I don't know.

8601
04:59:43,540 --> 04:59:44,880
Grandpa is down!

8602
04:59:45,500 --> 04:59:47,520
Grandpa got his arm snapped.

8603
04:59:48,960 --> 04:59:51,080
I hope he can cast a healing spell!

8604
04:59:51,320 --> 04:59:51,420
Oh!

8605
04:59:51,420 --> 04:59:53,160
But that won't save him!

8606
04:59:53,200 --> 04:59:54,460
Oh he's got him!

8607
04:59:54,560 --> 04:59:55,120
He's got him!

8608
04:59:55,880 --> 04:59:57,100
There's no way!

8609
04:59:57,260 --> 04:59:58,000
It's over!

8610
04:59:58,340 --> 04:59:59,320
It's over!

8611
05:00:01,250 --> 05:00:04,260
Beto packed up Octavio in the caramels.

8612
05:00:04,260 --> 05:00:05,420
Here is your winner!

8613
05:00:09,220 --> 05:00:10,620
Charlie Bitt!

8614
05:00:11,900 --> 05:00:13,300
Charlie Bitt!

8615
05:00:13,300 --> 05:00:13,420
Charlie Bitt!

8616
05:00:13,420 --> 05:00:16,640
Charlie Bitt!

8617
05:00:16,720 --> 05:00:19,440
That was an insane fight.

8618
05:00:19,660 --> 05:00:24,320
I witnessed more yoga moves there than I have in the entirety of my career in yoga.

8619
05:00:24,820 --> 05:00:27,300
I mean that was a simply acrobatic fight.

8620
05:00:27,560 --> 05:00:32,500
I saw more skin and body angles than I did in the entire just chatting section of Twitch.

8621
05:00:32,640 --> 05:00:33,260
That was insane.

8622
05:00:35,740 --> 05:00:39,660
I think that was a true test of wrestling supremacy right there.

8623
05:00:39,700 --> 05:00:40,140
That was beautiful.

8624
05:00:40,360 --> 05:00:41,360
That was a true art form.

8625
05:00:42,240 --> 05:00:43,080
It was.

8626
05:00:43,080 --> 05:00:44,400
You couldn't have said it any better.

8627
05:00:44,540 --> 05:00:45,260
God damn!

8628
05:00:47,080 --> 05:00:49,380
Oh was there any doubt?

8629
05:00:50,120 --> 05:00:50,960
A little bit.

8630
05:00:50,980 --> 05:00:51,880
Was there any doubt that you were going to win?

8631
05:00:51,900 --> 05:00:52,060
A little bit.

8632
05:00:52,060 --> 05:00:54,720
Was there any doubt in I, Charlie Gavis Beto?

8633
05:00:56,900 --> 05:00:57,400
Octavio.

8634
05:00:57,860 --> 05:00:58,820
That was good.

8635
05:00:58,960 --> 05:01:02,100
I liked how they danced around the battlefield.

8636
05:01:02,680 --> 05:01:04,820
They showed how they'll touch each other's skin.

8637
05:01:06,340 --> 05:01:07,180
They showed how they'll touch each other's skin.

8638
05:01:07,180 --> 05:01:08,130
It's the dude from Konosuba!

8639
05:01:08,760 --> 05:01:09,040
It's the dude from Konosuba!

8640
05:01:09,040 --> 05:01:09,480
That's crazy!

8641
05:01:11,840 --> 05:01:16,480
I think we were off the ground more than we were on it in that fight.

8642
05:01:16,620 --> 05:01:17,680
Yeah, yeah.

8643
05:01:17,880 --> 05:01:21,020
We were like rabbits, pounding each other.

8644
05:01:22,700 --> 05:01:26,520
I have never seen so much um...

8645
05:01:29,600 --> 05:01:30,200
inspiration.

8646
05:01:31,320 --> 05:01:31,920
Athleticism?

8647
05:01:32,280 --> 05:01:32,880
Skill?

8648
05:01:32,960 --> 05:01:35,960
Yes, passion for the fight.

8649
05:01:37,000 --> 05:01:38,740
Yeah, that was a good whole movie.

8650
05:01:38,820 --> 05:01:39,360
I'm not going to lie.

8651
05:01:39,540 --> 05:01:40,180
I respect it.

8652
05:01:40,940 --> 05:01:42,240
Yeah, we're amateurs though.

8653
05:01:45,560 --> 05:01:46,160
Alright!

8654
05:01:46,740 --> 05:01:47,680
Beto, Beto!

8655
05:01:47,760 --> 05:01:49,200
Congratulations on the win!

8656
05:01:49,240 --> 05:01:51,000
Was there any doubt in your mind?

8657
05:01:51,900 --> 05:01:52,860
No, no.

8658
05:01:52,900 --> 05:01:53,960
I don't doubt myself.

8659
05:01:54,040 --> 05:01:57,100
I am a man of pure and unbridled confidence.

8660
05:01:57,940 --> 05:01:59,600
It's just the way things go.

8661
05:01:59,880 --> 05:02:02,860
Do you know what it takes to win this entire tournament?

8662
05:02:03,260 --> 05:02:07,280
Yeah, that was an insane showcasing of skill.

8663
05:02:07,480 --> 05:02:08,640
I think you have potential.

8664
05:02:09,520 --> 05:02:10,680
No he doesn't.

8665
05:02:10,820 --> 05:02:11,700
I'm going to beat him.

8666
05:02:11,940 --> 05:02:12,980
I've already won!

8667
05:02:13,360 --> 05:02:14,620
I've already won!

8668
05:02:16,720 --> 05:02:17,940
Anyone can face me!

8669
05:02:18,460 --> 05:02:19,380
Consider it done!

8670
05:02:19,740 --> 05:02:21,500
Alright viewers, you heard it here.

8671
05:02:21,900 --> 05:02:22,780
He's already won.

8672
05:02:22,920 --> 05:02:29,160
So let's take it back to backstage Doki coming front stage for our last remaining things to say for today.

8673
05:02:30,860 --> 05:02:31,460
No!

8674
05:02:31,460 --> 05:02:32,100
Thanks Doki!

8675
05:02:32,240 --> 05:02:33,120
Don't fire me!

8676
05:02:35,620 --> 05:02:36,600
She wouldn't...

8677
05:02:36,600 --> 05:02:37,060
Alright.

8678
05:02:37,620 --> 05:02:41,260
Filia would read anything in the Discord chat which I figured out.

8679
05:02:41,460 --> 05:02:45,560
Because I literally wrote Charlie versus Octavio.

8680
05:02:45,740 --> 05:02:48,240
And she actually read it.

8681
05:02:48,600 --> 05:02:49,200
What?

8682
05:02:51,100 --> 05:02:52,600
I was like, are those these guys?

8683
05:02:52,740 --> 05:02:53,340
Are these guys just...

8684
05:02:53,360 --> 05:02:54,960
Are they coming on to help?

8685
05:02:56,760 --> 05:02:58,980
I was too afraid to say their names.

8686
05:02:59,160 --> 05:03:00,160
I was too afraid to say their names.

8687
05:03:00,460 --> 05:03:04,120
I knew his name was Batel but then he said like three other names.

8688
05:03:04,320 --> 05:03:05,760
So I was like, are you calling Batel?

8689
05:03:05,900 --> 05:03:07,260
Is this like a 40-4?

8690
05:03:08,060 --> 05:03:09,020
KeyCast confusion.

8691
05:03:09,860 --> 05:03:11,020
Bro, you wrote like...

8692
05:03:11,020 --> 05:03:13,760
I wrote like five different names.

8693
05:03:14,440 --> 05:03:16,440
Charlie versus Octavio.

8694
05:03:16,540 --> 05:03:18,700
Beto versus Octavio.

8695
05:03:18,780 --> 05:03:20,540
I didn't know what was going on.

8696
05:03:21,060 --> 05:03:21,640
I didn't know what was going on.

8697
05:03:22,580 --> 05:03:23,100
I'm not sure.

8698
05:03:23,160 --> 05:03:23,260
I'm just kidding.

8699
05:03:23,260 --> 05:03:27,100
I just came here to say thank you to Filian and Snuffy for casting the last two matches.

8700
05:03:27,280 --> 05:03:30,100
If you enjoyed the casting, they will be casting more matches tomorrow.

8701
05:03:30,400 --> 05:03:32,620
We lost track of time and matches.

8702
05:03:33,800 --> 05:03:37,440
So, because of that, I forgot to put them in earlier.

8703
05:03:38,520 --> 05:03:40,100
But, do not worry.

8704
05:03:40,220 --> 05:03:41,900
They're gonna be casting more tomorrow.

8705
05:03:42,380 --> 05:03:44,260
It will be much more balanced.

8706
05:03:44,540 --> 05:03:45,120
But yes!

8707
05:03:45,160 --> 05:03:49,900
Give a huge shoutout and thank you to our casters, Filian and Snuffy!

8708
05:03:51,300 --> 05:03:52,860
Thank you for having me!

8709
05:03:53,240 --> 05:03:54,940
I can't wait to see you guys perform this together.

8710
05:03:55,880 --> 05:03:57,820
We'll see you guys tomorrow.

8711
05:03:58,000 --> 05:04:00,260
And I'm gonna do an outro for the viewers.

8712
05:04:00,380 --> 05:04:03,080
And also give a final note on who are the...

8713
05:04:03,080 --> 05:04:04,620
What are the matches for tomorrow.

8714
05:04:05,020 --> 05:04:07,280
I'll see you guys later, guys.

8715
05:04:08,020 --> 05:04:08,500
I'll see you guys later, guys.

8716
05:04:08,500 --> 05:04:08,620
Swag.

8717
05:04:08,760 --> 05:04:10,440
Peace out!

8718
05:04:10,620 --> 05:04:11,120
Let's go!

8719
05:04:12,560 --> 05:04:13,040
Alright.

8720
05:04:13,240 --> 05:04:16,340
I just left a call because I don't know how long they're gonna be there.

8721
05:04:16,900 --> 05:04:19,880
I just left a call because I don't know how long they're gonna be there.

8722
05:04:19,880 --> 05:04:22,240
Bring them in and bring me back into the...

8723
05:04:22,240 --> 05:04:23,660
Bring me back into this.

8724
05:04:24,040 --> 05:04:27,700
Like I said, huge thank you to all the casters.

8725
05:04:28,080 --> 05:04:39,360
Gerard, Octavio, Mint, Fillion, Snuffy, and then we have Taka filling in for Sayu to do the announcement very last minute.

8726
05:04:39,440 --> 05:04:42,720
Literally like 5-10 minutes before our stream was about to start.

8727
05:04:43,060 --> 05:04:44,440
Taka filled in.

8728
05:04:45,640 --> 05:04:47,700
And we were trying...

8729
05:04:47,700 --> 05:04:51,320
He tried very hard to like try to get the feeling of the announcements.

8730
05:04:51,660 --> 05:04:53,960
So a huge shout out to Taka.

8731
05:04:54,140 --> 05:04:58,260
Another big shout out to my sound guy for doing all the balancing live.

8732
05:04:58,400 --> 05:05:00,900
I'm sorry if the balancing needs...

8733
05:05:00,900 --> 05:05:04,880
The sound balancing might need a little bit more work.

8734
05:05:04,960 --> 05:05:05,680
I'm not sure yet.

8735
05:05:05,800 --> 05:05:06,560
Cause I don't know.

8736
05:05:06,700 --> 05:05:09,880
I can't rewatch the VOD to see if anything needs balancing.

8737
05:05:12,960 --> 05:05:15,560
But yes, a huge shout out to all the cast.

8738
05:05:15,760 --> 05:05:16,920
Everybody that participated.

8739
05:05:17,940 --> 05:05:20,220
For like 5 hours.

8740
05:05:20,260 --> 05:05:22,600
We've been going at it for 5 hours for day 1.

8741
05:05:22,780 --> 05:05:27,000
Now some of you guys are wondering what will be on day 2.

8742
05:05:27,000 --> 05:05:27,760
Day 2.

8743
05:05:27,840 --> 05:05:30,900
We do have some matches that weren't able to be played.

8744
05:05:31,060 --> 05:05:33,340
So we're gonna be playing some of those matches.

8745
05:05:33,640 --> 05:05:38,920
So let me get out my handy text tool real quick guys.

8746
05:05:40,760 --> 05:05:41,280
Alright.

8747
05:05:41,800 --> 05:05:43,220
So from here.

8748
05:05:43,720 --> 05:05:44,240
Emma.

8749
05:05:45,700 --> 05:05:48,020
Emma made it out from here.

8750
05:05:48,140 --> 05:05:50,700
So let me put Emma here.

8751
05:05:50,820 --> 05:05:52,420
We're doing this live everybody.

8752
05:05:53,240 --> 05:05:54,900
Emma will be here.

8753
05:05:56,100 --> 05:05:57,480
They made... Oh my gosh.

8754
05:05:57,500 --> 05:05:58,620
White text is not it.

8755
05:06:01,600 --> 05:06:02,200
Here we go.

8756
05:06:02,480 --> 05:06:03,080
Sorry.

8757
05:06:03,160 --> 05:06:04,760
This is um...

8758
05:06:05,620 --> 05:06:07,020
A little scuffed here.

8759
05:06:07,220 --> 05:06:10,620
Emma made it to the finals for day 2.

8760
05:06:11,180 --> 05:06:13,340
We also have for tomorrow.

8761
05:06:13,520 --> 05:06:15,540
We will have Fuyo vs.

8762
05:06:15,900 --> 05:06:18,520
Snuffy and Nana vs.

8763
05:06:19,240 --> 05:06:19,520
whoever.

8764
05:06:19,880 --> 05:06:21,300
Who wins that second bracket.

8765
05:06:21,700 --> 05:06:24,400
So let me copy and paste real quick.

8766
05:06:25,440 --> 05:06:26,720
Put that here.

8767
05:06:27,080 --> 05:06:30,700
As Nana has defeated Gerard.

8768
05:06:30,760 --> 05:06:31,820
We'll fix it in post.

8769
05:06:34,900 --> 05:06:36,400
It's a live experience.

8770
05:06:36,400 --> 05:06:38,700
You know this is not pre-recorded.

8771
05:06:38,980 --> 05:06:41,340
So from here this will be bracket 1.

8772
05:06:41,500 --> 05:06:43,160
These are the matches that we are gonna have.

8773
05:06:43,360 --> 05:06:46,060
We're gonna have Fuyo vs.

8774
05:06:46,280 --> 05:06:47,320
Snuffy tomorrow.

8775
05:06:47,740 --> 05:06:48,860
And then...

8776
05:06:50,660 --> 05:06:52,720
And then we'll have Nana vs.

8777
05:06:52,960 --> 05:06:54,320
whoever wins that match up.

8778
05:06:54,420 --> 05:06:56,060
And then Emma right here.

8779
05:06:56,380 --> 05:06:57,860
Um... the second bracket.

8780
05:06:58,300 --> 05:06:58,860
Okay.

8781
05:06:58,940 --> 05:06:59,840
Where's my other image?
