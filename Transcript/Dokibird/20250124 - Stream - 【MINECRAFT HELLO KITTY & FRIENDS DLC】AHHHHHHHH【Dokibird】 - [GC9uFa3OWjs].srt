1
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,680
Fake out, don't loop, cuz I fucked up.

2
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,240
My eyes were like, where's my scene?

3
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,260
I was like, where is it?

4
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,100
Where's my solo?

5
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,900
Where's my solo scene?

6
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,320
Fucking my brain is not okay right now.

7
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:12,440
I think like in four years, I have never like overslept a stream.

8
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,160
And like not even have a waiting room up.

9
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,780
I was not okay.

10
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,040
I was absolutely not okay.

11
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,740
So sorry guys, I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,400
Okay, so basically what happened is that I think Borderlands really fucked me up and...

13
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,480
Okay, watching the movie, I was so tired right after.

14
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Like that took a lot of mental fortitude to get through Borderlands.

15
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:54,220
All the dragoons that were strong enough, all the dragoons that were trying so hard to be strong enough for Borderlands.

16
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,080
It fucked me up too.

17
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,400
Don't worry guys, it also fucked me up.

18
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,500
It was a wild ride.

19
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,780
It was such a bad movie.

20
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,500
I never realized how bad a movie could get until I watched Borderlands.

21
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,700
It's absolutely crazy.

22
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:18,120
For those who've never watched Borderlands, it is the most PG fucking movie for a game about guns, shooting, and killing.

23
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,620
Like for a game about all of that stuff.

24
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,420
Like the game is really well known for guns, shooting, and killing.

25
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,600
But yet there was no blood or anything.

26
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,760
It was very PG.

27
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,100
It was wild.

28
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,080
I'm like Borderlands is not a PG game.

29
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,460
Like I don't know how the fuck they were able to do all that for this movie.

30
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,520
But that made the movie incredibly mediocre.

31
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,860
It was so bad.

32
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,740
The casting was so bad too.

33
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,900
Thank you for the 5k subs.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
Thank you, thank you.

35
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,640
Blake, welcome to the tomato farm.

36
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,520
Welcome, welcome.

37
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,560
So like right after the movie...

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,340
Okay, I would be surprised if we get a lot of people watching today.

39
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,960
Because people would be like, oh, I think she forgot.

40
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,080
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,200
Which is sort of like me where I was sleeping the entire time.

42
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,520
I...

43
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,620
Anyway...

44
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,600
Anyway, so...

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,160
That movie was the very first time I was like, maybe we should have a good movie next time.

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,400
Like we need to cleanse this.

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,640
Anyway, so...

48
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,200
I actually...

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,440
I actually like went to sleep right after the movie.

50
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,560
I was so tired.

51
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
I legitimately like just went...

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
Like I was like, alright, see you guys.

53
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,840
And I went straight to bed.

54
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,820
And I woke up at 11pm.

55
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,840
I woke up, I was like almost midnight.

56
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,320
I woke up like midnight technically.

57
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,260
Because it was like 11.45.

58
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,960
So like I woke up at midnight.

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
And I was like, oh my god.

60
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm so tired.

61
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,200
I was like, I was like...

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,940
I'm so tired.

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,140
And I just stayed in bed for like, I think like an hour or two.

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,260
I was like, I'm just gonna relax an hour or two.

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,840
And then I'll get to work.

66
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,500
I'll get to work.

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
You're gonna go to work after this.

68
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,480
You have so much stuff to do.

69
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,420
And then like I stayed in bed for an hour.

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,420
But I was like, oh but the bed is so comfy.

71
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,160
The bed is so comfy.

72
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,060
So I think I stayed there for like an hour or two.

73
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,480
And then...

74
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,840
I fell back asleep.

75
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,260
I fell back asleep.

76
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,680
And I woke up at like...

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,580
I woke up at like...

78
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,020
Well, and then my manager woke me up.

79
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,540
I was so confused.

80
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,860
You know like when you like...

81
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,220
You got wake up, woken up like suddenly.

82
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,720
And you're so like, where am I?

83
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,320
Like, who am I?

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,140
You're like...

85
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,460
You're like, where am I?

86
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,440
Who am I?

87
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,820
What the fuck is going on?

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,860
So I was just like, oh my god.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,820
And then like my phone was ringing.

90
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,340
And then my manager was like, you have a stream!

91
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,940
And then I was like, oh my god.

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,940
It's 12.35!

93
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,420
And then the other thing is like, where are you?

94
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,600
You have a stream!

95
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,860
And I'm like, oh fuck, I'm sorry.

96
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,120
I'm so sorry.

97
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,880
I'm so fucked up right now.

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,660
I'm so fucked up.

99
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,260
Okay.

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,140
Alright.

101
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,800
This is gonna be TMI.

102
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,040
The reason why...

103
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,700
Because I was debating.

104
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,880
Do I talk about why I was so fucked up?

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,980
It's the time of my month.

106
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,440
Sadly, I'm a woman.

107
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,960
I got debuffed hard.

108
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
Okay, guys.

109
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,440
I'm getting debuffed right now.

110
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,080
So I'm sleeping a lot more.

111
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,740
Not the woman debuff.

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,180
Yes, unfortunately, this is the time where I'm reminded that I'm a woman.

113
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,220
And I'm like, no!

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,840
I'm not one of the boys today!

115
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,620
I'm like, no!

116
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,820
I can't be one of the boys!

117
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,960
I was lied.

118
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,540
Thank you for the Akasupa.

119
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,040
Thank you, thank you.

120
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,780
I can't think of anything funny to say.

121
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,640
So thanks for the last four years of laughs and good times.

122
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you for the Akasupa!

123
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,000
Not go cry in Marvel.

124
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,780
Thank you for the Akasupa.

125
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,080
Thank you, thank you.

126
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,860
No!

127
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,520
Broski's status lost for the day.

128
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,120
So like, now you understand why I was like fucking hibernation mode right now.

129
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,780
I'm not a real bro.

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,140
No way!

131
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,860
My bro's a woman?

132
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,180
How dare you lie to us like this?

133
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,860
Anyway.

134
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
So Zafia, thank you for the super chat.

135
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Thank you, thank you.

136
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,520
Wait, why is that?

137
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:57,100
Why you always choose to make us watch all these awful movies to make us suffer together when I'm already suffering anyway?

138
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,260
What's one more bad movie?

139
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,680
What's one more bad movie?

140
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,560
Thank you for the super chat.

141
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,740
Thank you, thank you.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,280
Magic, thank you for the super chat.

143
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,980
Thank you, thank you.

144
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,360
As a Michi viewer, almost nothing is TMI.

145
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,180
Thank you for the super chat.

146
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,460
Thank you, thank you.

147
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,220
Alright.

148
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,400
So yes, that's also why I was sleeping a lot.

149
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,180
Because I was just, you know, I'm so fucked up at the moment.

150
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,020
I'm very fucked up at the moment so I needed to sleep more.

151
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,460
So yeah, anyway.

152
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,360
So I hope the volume is a lot better now.

153
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
Just the volume is a lot better.

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm sorry if the music was too loud that you couldn't hear me scream that I'm a woman.

155
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,220
Zero.

156
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,200
Thank you for the super chat.

157
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,020
Thank you, thank you.

158
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
So I fixed the volume.

159
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,220
We can blame the D.va for what happened yesterday.

160
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,520
Thank you for the super chat.

161
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,560
Thank you, thank you.

162
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,600
Wait, could you guys sort of heard me in the beginning?

163
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,760
Even if the music was a little loud, were you guys still able to hear me?

164
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,080
Because the music guys were like, you should turn your music down.

165
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,540
You should turn the music down.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,700
You're a woman!

167
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,040
Okay, welcome to the pro tomato farm.

168
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,140
Welcome, welcome.

169
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,100
That's why there was no waiting room or anything.

170
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,800
I had other stuff to worry about right now like to not fucking die from blood loss.

171
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,120
Speaking of that, I should drink some water soon to replenish my blood.

172
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,500
I'll be right back so I don't pass out.

173
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,900
Alright, enough about that.

174
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,820
Alright guys, enough about that.

175
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,620
I was like, the one time I let people know that I'm sadly not one of the boys today.

176
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,960
I got a fucking debuff of the month.

177
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,040
Thank you for the super chat.

178
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
Thank you, thank you.

179
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,480
I'm not pro for today, Saj.

180
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,420
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

181
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,340
Thank you, thank you.

182
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,160
I told you not to make us watch Borderlands.

183
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,100
I told you!

184
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,220
What is this fucking curse that you put upon me?

185
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,860
I can't believe it.

186
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,540
That's crazy.

187
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,640
Marco, thank you for the super chat.

188
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,340
Thank you, thank you.

189
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,400
Speaking of blood, Doom and Ninja Gaiden both have sequels now.

190
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,200
Thank you for the super chat.

191
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,160
Thank you, thank you.

192
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,080
Alright, so...

193
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,900
Today, we are gonna be playing Minecraft!

194
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,120
Let's see, let me make sure it's full screen.

195
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,820
I know people are like...

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,980
How do I do this?

197
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,040
So, this is Bedrock Edition, so I'm a little confused too.

198
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,460
I'm a little confused too.

199
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,080
I've never played Bedrock Edition before.

200
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,380
And apparently, it's a whole new world out there.

201
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,540
So, they just recently released...

202
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,380
This was back then, before I went indie.

203
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,200
I really wanted to play the Minecraft DLCs.

204
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,720
Because there was Spongebob, there was Disney.

205
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,060
At that time, I requested it and stuff like that.

206
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,520
But obviously, we couldn't because of firms.

207
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,660
Because they're like...

208
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,720
They're like...

209
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,760
There's like, you know, IPs and stuff.

210
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,740
And I really wanted to do the Disney one.

211
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,020
And the Sonic the Hedgehog.

212
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,800
There was all of that.

213
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,020
I was never able to.

214
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,000
And then, this week, they released...

215
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,440
They released the Sanrio Hello Kitty and Friends DLC for Minecraft.

216
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,000
And apparently, it's not just regular Minecraft.

217
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,560
It is...

218
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,440
It is...

219
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,880
There's like mini-games.

220
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,120
There's like mini-games in it.

221
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,100
So, like, for the Sanrio one...

222
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,620
Apparently, it's a farming game.

223
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,040
So, it's like basically a farming game with your Sanrio friends and stuff like that.

224
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,400
And so, I'm super excited.

225
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,280
I've never played Bedrock Edition before.

226
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,320
Well, to be fair, I don't play much Minecraft, too.

227
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,000
So, like, you know...

228
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,160
It's sort of like...

229
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,600
I just don't play a lot of Minecraft.

230
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,560
But, like, especially, I've never touched Bedrock.

231
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,420
And it's like...

232
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,700
You gotta...

233
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,700
There's like...

234
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,220
Oh, there's so many different things to it.

235
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,560
So, like, for the characters...

236
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,220
You can't use custom Minecraft skins.

237
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,080
You actually have to...

238
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,880
Pay for your skins.

239
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,460
Which is a little weird.

240
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,600
It's a little weird.

241
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,700
But, like, hey, you gotta farm the children somehow.

242
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,220
You know?

243
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,860
You gotta...

244
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,620
You gotta...

245
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,800
You gotta farm the kids for money somehow.

246
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,560
Yeah, so, like...

247
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,640
Wait, you can upload your skins?

248
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,100
Okay.

249
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,820
Wait, give me a sec.

250
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,640
Alright.

251
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,780
Is it here?

252
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,440
Create class?

253
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,500
Oh, that's place.

254
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,020
Oh, but then can I wear...

255
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,380
Can I wear clothes with custom skins, though?

256
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,460
Guys?

257
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,560
Can I, like, wear clothes with custom skins?

258
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,180
Chat?

259
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,760
Or, like...

260
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,180
Or, like...

261
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,600
No?

262
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,620
Like, in the...

263
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,300
Okay.

264
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,480
Now, you guys.

265
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:55,840
Alright.

266
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,100
Wait.

267
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,440
I can buy skins, though.

268
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,220
Alright, guys.

269
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,320
It's time to spend some...

270
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,560
Guys, it's time.

271
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,920
We're gonna spend my...

272
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,620
We're gonna spend some money.

273
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,520
It's time.

274
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,880
It's time.

275
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,720
I'm in too deep.

276
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,420
Oh, my God.

277
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,020
I could be in a bad...

278
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,780
Alright, guys.

279
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
I'm already in too deep, guys.

280
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,260
We're gonna spend some...

281
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,280
What the hell?

282
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,680
There's...

283
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,900
Oh, my God.

284
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,400
What are all these skins?

285
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,620
Best-selling.

286
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,680
Ender...

287
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,040
Are you serious?

288
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,060
Skippity Toilet.

289
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,660
Oh, my God.

290
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,200
These are definitely for children.

291
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,520
The fact that, like...

292
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:32,840
Skippity...

293
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,440
Skippity Toilet is the best-selling Minecraft skin out there.

294
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,460
Oh, my God.

295
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:41,740
Okay.

296
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,940
Milo and Chip Friends Christmas.

297
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,960
Everything by Minecraft.

298
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,360
Oh, there's, like...

299
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,600
I, like, there's a whole category just for Star Wars.

300
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,060
What?

301
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,940
There's an entire category that's just for fucking Star Wars.

302
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,320
Okay.

303
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,280
All skin packs.

304
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:02,700
Alright.

305
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,680
What do we...

306
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,160
Should we...

307
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,500
Oh.

308
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,560
Bees.

309
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,080
Bees Teens.

310
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,720
Oh, my God, guys.

311
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,100
Let's go back.

312
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,860
Let's do high school roleplay.

313
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,040
Oh, my God.

314
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,640
Anime Slayers.

315
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,460
Wait.

316
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,040
Wait.

317
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:24,580
Become a fierce and fearless warrior when you gear up in Anime Slayers skins.

318
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:31,800
Roleplay with friends in colorful robes and colorful hair and big anime eyes.

319
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,060
Okay, but, like...

320
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,640
Oh, my God, guys.

321
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,220
I could be anime.

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,320
These look so...

323
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,260
I could...

324
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,080
Oh, my God, guys.

325
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,080
I could be anime all night.

326
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,080
Oh, my God.

327
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,540
I could be babies.

328
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,660
What are these skins?

329
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,160
What are these skins?

330
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,720
That's so kawaii.

331
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,660
Oh, my God.

332
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,040
They're cute.

333
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,360
They're, like, so kawaii.

334
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,700
Oh, desu ne?

335
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,760
I'm sorry.

336
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm so sorry.

337
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,020
I'm cringing, too.

338
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm so...

339
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,580
I'm so sorry.

340
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,120
It's me in charred anime.

341
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,320
Stop.

342
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,840
All right.

343
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,140
What else could I be?

344
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,420
Young Royals pastel.

345
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,920
What are these?

346
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
They're just...

347
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,480
Oh, my God.

348
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,440
I could be game.

349
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,580
I could be camo.

350
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,380
Look at the added eyes.

351
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,920
That's not even camo anymore.

352
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,760
All right.

353
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
I'm suffering.

354
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,540
Why are they all just teens?

355
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,420
What?

356
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,380
The rich royal family.

357
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,040
Free the squirrels.

358
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,700
Oh, my God.

359
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,860
Guys, I could be a gamer right now.

360
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,920
Guys, oh, my God.

361
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,940
Are you a gamer?

362
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,040
Ready up with your game merch and headset for an all-night gaming session.

363
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,060
Let's go.

364
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:53,900
Here.

365
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,900
Don't do that ever again.

366
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,260
Thank you for the super chat.

367
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:57,620
Thank you.

368
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,200
Thank you.

369
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,340
Well, if you're in too deep already, thank you for the super chat.

370
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:02,820
Thank you.

371
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,160
Oh, my God.

372
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,420
Wait.

373
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:04,820
Okay.

374
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,120
These are actually really cute.

375
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,780
Okay, but I'm not a furry, but these are really cute.

376
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,340
I'm sorry.

377
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,300
But I like the...

378
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,640
Not the wolves.

379
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,300
Not the wolves.

380
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,200
I'm not talking about the wolves, guys.

381
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm not talking about the wolves.

382
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,540
Oh, my God.

383
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,420
Oh, that cottage cat skin.

384
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,300
They're so cute.

385
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,080
You can't...

386
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,620
Okay, anyway.

387
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,460
Guys, I could be a gamer girl right now.

388
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:28,940
Guys.

389
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,860
Guys, what if I become a gamer girl right here?

390
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,520
This is where...

391
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,220
I could just be a gamer girl right now.

392
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,640
There's like...

393
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,020
There's Pat's style paradise.

394
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,500
I don't know what to be.

395
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,120
There's so many choices.

396
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,660
There's so...

397
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,620
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

398
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:49,980
Thank you.

399
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,660
Thank you.

400
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,480
You're never beating the furry allocations.

401
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,960
Mega, thank you for the super chat.

402
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,280
Thank you.

403
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,960
Thank you.

404
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,820
Java players, check in here.

405
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,120
Thank you for the super chat.

406
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,460
Thank you.

407
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,680
I know I should be playing the game, but I can't help it.

408
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,640
There's so many skins.

409
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:05,920
I like...

410
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,320
Which one do I get?

411
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,160
Guys.

412
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't know.

413
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,160
Do I...

414
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,700
Okay, alright.

415
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,540
Here are the choices.

416
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,060
It's...

417
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,480
Oh, the millionaire roleplay.

418
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,860
How the fuck do I know if I'm a millionaire?

419
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,800
Like, is that it?

420
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,520
Is that...

421
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,180
Is it Barack Obama?

422
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,740
And tells that I'm a millionaire?

423
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,420
Like, how does...

424
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,560
How does this...

425
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,320
He's just...

426
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,860
Guys with big eyes.

427
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,800
How do...

428
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,240
How is that...

429
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm a millionaire.

430
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,260
I don't understand.

431
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,080
We know what you are.

432
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,700
Black.

433
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,780
Thank you for the super chat.

434
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,160
Thank you.

435
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,780
Thank you.

436
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Not so Deadpool.

437
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
Doki, I can't lose to another Vtuber to the wolves.

438
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,020
Please.

439
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,460
Thank you for the super chat.

440
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:49,940
Thank you.

441
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,540
Thank you.

442
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,320
Alright, guys.

443
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,600
Here are the choices.

444
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,420
Guys.

445
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,840
I either be anime skin or gamer girl.

446
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,520
Alright.

447
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,760
Those are our choices.

448
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,200
Doki, please.

449
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,960
There are so many.

450
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,480
Why?

451
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,140
Those...

452
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,460
Guys.

453
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:04,780
Okay.

454
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,340
Alright, guys.

455
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,020
There are two choices we have.

456
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,920
We're either anime girl, anime, anime, or gamer.

457
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,220
I'll make a poll.

458
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,380
I'll make a poll.

459
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm spending real hard-earned money for this.

460
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,540
Minecraft.

461
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,800
Sorry, I'm spending your hard-earned money.

462
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,260
Let me be more clear.

463
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,500
I'm spending all your hard-earned...

464
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,400
Wolf Teens.

465
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,700
Important correction.

466
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, my God.

467
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,620
Wait, I didn't know this was Wolf Teens.

468
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,100
The Wolf Teens are back, but this time in HD version.

469
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,720
Oh, my God.

470
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,500
What is...

471
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,500
Vampires and werewolves.

472
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,560
Okay.

473
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,540
Wait a second.

474
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,120
We might have a secret contender here.

475
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,160
Look at this.

476
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,700
The vampire and werewolves.

477
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,680
Okay.

478
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,740
But these are...

479
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,280
This is Wolf Teens.

480
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:00,780
Okay.

481
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,340
Secret surprise contenders.

482
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,780
Guys.

483
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,080
Oh, come on.

484
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,740
Okay.

485
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,620
Never mind.

486
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,400
Never mind.

487
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,700
These looked so much better.

488
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,540
I legitimately was like so excited.

489
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,640
I was like, oh, my God.

490
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,400
I was like, oh, my God.

491
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,340
That looks like...

492
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,500
Oh, my God.

493
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,220
I won't be here.

494
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,180
And then it's like you open it and you're just like, oh.

495
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,520
That's...

496
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,500
I got clickbaited so hard.

497
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,760
I was so excited.

498
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,580
Oh, my God.

499
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,500
There's the pot.

500
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,600
Oh, my God.

501
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,200
There's...

502
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,380
There's the circus.

503
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,420
Oh.

504
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,840
Oh, my God.

505
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,960
I could be Poppy right now.

506
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,900
I could...

507
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,180
I...

508
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,680
Oh, my...

509
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,620
I could be Hasbun Hotel right now.

510
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,300
I could...

511
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,540
I could...

512
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,860
I could...

513
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,640
You know, you could get these skins.

514
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,740
You could get these skins for free in Java.

515
00:20:52,040 --> 00:21:01,740
But, like, why get it for free in Java when I could pay these children your hard-earned money to be in Hasbun Hotel?

516
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,420
I...

517
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,120
MrBrokenBond, thank you for the super chat.

518
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,560
Thank you.

519
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,440
Thank you.

520
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,740
Become the woman you were always meant to be, Toki.

521
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,600
Poor woman.

522
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,040
God.

523
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,460
MrBrokenBond, thank you for the super chat.

524
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,820
Thank you.

525
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,500
Thank you.

526
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,040
Fistful, thank you for the super chat.

527
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,300
Thank you.

528
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,800
Thank you.

529
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,920
It was a bit late to stream, but I hope you're doing well.

530
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,960
Looking forward to the comfy times.

531
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,060
With Sadio characters, thank you for the super chat.

532
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,420
Thank you.

533
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,060
Thank you.

534
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,260
Yeah.

535
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,420
I can't wait to start the game soon.

536
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
And, like, even though we've been doing...

537
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,620
We've been looking at skins for 20 minutes.

538
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,800
Oh, my God.

539
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,360
Dream+.

540
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,360
Do not give Dream more money.

541
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:51,200
The funny thing is that at least 1,000 children bought this pack.

542
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,420
At least...

543
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,420
At least 1,000 children bought this pack, too.

544
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,160
Because there's 1,000...

545
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,660
1,000 reviews.

546
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,520
That's crazy.

547
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,240
But there's so many Dream packs, though.

548
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,880
There's so many.

549
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,740
1,800 more kids bought this pack.

550
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,360
What the fuck?

551
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,160
Where are these children paying for my career?

552
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,380
I'm sorry.

553
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,480
Those poor kids.

554
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,220
Oh, my God.

555
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,720
Oh, my...

556
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,840
I can't believe 1,800...

557
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,040
At least...

558
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,880
That's, like, enough for the children that actually gave reviews.

559
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,300
Because, like, who the fuck reviews things, especially for Minecraft skin packs?

560
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,440
Is anything...

561
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,160
Oh, that's true.

562
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,440
What comes up?

563
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,540
Doki.

564
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,520
Doki Doki Club.

565
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,520
That could be a Doki Doki Literature Club right now.

566
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,660
Like...

567
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,380
Who...

568
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,920
Okay, okay.

569
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,540
There's...

570
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,960
There's these guys.

571
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,460
Wait, we're just, like, characters that aren't even in the game.

572
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,300
There is...

573
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,180
Let's go.

574
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,980
Oh, my God.

575
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,540
It could be Doki Doki Lit.

576
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,920
My Little Princess.

577
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,440
Animal Hoodies.

578
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,480
The Mafia.

579
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,600
Oh, my God.

580
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,340
Cute Bears!

581
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,560
Oh, my...

582
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:11,940
Oh, my God.

583
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,160
Wait.

584
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,780
Monsters.

585
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,540
Oh, my God.

586
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
That could be Sans Undertale.

587
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,160
So...

588
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,720
Okay, guys.

589
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,660
I know, like...

590
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,080
I talked about all of that stuff.

591
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,600
And we voted Gamer Girl.

592
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,060
Also, PowerPo.

593
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,220
Thank you for the super chat.

594
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,580
Thank you.

595
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,960
Doki Skin Pack 1.

596
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,060
But, like...

597
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,900
Okay, guys.

598
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,940
I could be...

599
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,180
I could legitimately be Sans Undertale right now.

600
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,340
But, like, guys.

601
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,540
I could be Sans Undertale in Sanrio.

602
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,640
Also, let me look at cute bears real quick.

603
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,980
Okay, they're pretty cute.

604
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,960
But, like, I don't like...

605
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,800
The clothes are weird.

606
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,660
I don't know.

607
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,940
When they're not farming, it's just, like...

608
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,840
It's...

609
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,960
Trendy bears.

610
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,420
Oh, my God.

611
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:53,560
Oh, my God.

612
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,520
Oh, there you go.

613
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:55,860
Okay.

614
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,760
It's just the fact that they're not farming, so, like...

615
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
It's weird seeing them in any other clothes.

616
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,160
It's so weird seeing them in, like...

617
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,100
Actual...

618
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Because then it gets into furry territory.

619
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,860
Farming bear is like...

620
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,940
Oh, they're just farmers.

621
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,020
But now, I'm like...

622
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,860
Oh, maybe it's, like, something more.

623
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,020
Like...

624
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,800
Alright, guys.

625
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,280
I'm sorry.

626
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,580
I'm gonna...

627
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,660
I'm gonna buy...

628
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Guys, I'm sorry.

629
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,060
I just...

630
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,080
I really want to be Sans Undertale in...

631
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,300
Um...

632
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,180
Wait, there's better...

633
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,140
Wait, is this better Sans Undertale?

634
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,340
Does he look...

635
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,840
No, that...

636
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,600
He looks worse.

637
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,620
Which is the best Sans Undertale?

638
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,300
Oh, my God.

639
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,160
Feast streamers.

640
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,000
Am I in there?

641
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Am I good enough?

642
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,120
I don't...

643
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:38,880
No.

644
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,180
I'm not even...

645
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,520
I'm not...

646
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm not real, apparently.

647
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,780
VTuber teens?

648
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,680
Like, what does that even mean?

649
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,040
What does that even...

650
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,660
Anime...

651
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:50,840
I...

652
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,060
Okay.

653
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,140
What does VTuber teens mean?

654
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,760
VTubers are awesome.

655
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,780
Some are cute.

656
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,540
Some are funny.

657
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,740
And some are gamers.

658
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,500
And some just like to watch anime and chat.

659
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,100
But what's best about them is that they are all lovable.

660
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:04,780
Okay.

661
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,320
They're inspired by VTubers.

662
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,560
Okay, I can...

663
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:08,780
Oh.

664
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,320
Oh!

665
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:09,980
Okay.

666
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,920
That's just...

667
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,020
That's just Hololive.

668
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,300
Okay.

669
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,280
That's fine.

670
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,080
I guess I'm not inspiring enough.

671
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,120
I'm not...

672
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,140
It's alright, guys.

673
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm just not that inspiring, I guess.

674
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,460
Why are they so...

675
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,880
It's like Hololive for kids.

676
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,060
Guys, it's Hololive for kids.

677
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,640
Alright.

678
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,200
Alright.

679
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,460
I guess I wanna be Sans Undertale.

680
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,460
This is what I'm paying for.

681
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,500
I'm sorry for...

682
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,860
I know, like, you all wanted me to be Gamer Girl.

683
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,460
But then I realized...

684
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,460
I could pay to be Sans Undertale.

685
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,500
I can...

686
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,200
I could...

687
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,940
I could pay for that.

688
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,680
Alright, guys.

689
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,440
I'm spending 400 and I just bought Sans Undertale.

690
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,060
Yes, please!

691
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,820
Alright.

692
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,960
This is it.

693
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,500
That is the money I have used.

694
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,200
Alright, how do I use this?

695
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,600
I bought him.

696
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,820
So, like, how do I become him?

697
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,980
I bought him.

698
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,700
Give me Sans Undertale.

699
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,420
I legit...

700
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,520
I just bought money.

701
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,260
Wait, where is it?

702
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,940
Choose new skin.

703
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,960
Wait, where is it?

704
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,220
I bought him.

705
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,760
Did I not spend my money?

706
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,120
No, I do.

707
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,620
I have 1,400 left.

708
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,040
Oh, there we go.

709
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,160
Okay.

710
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,600
Equip the monster.

711
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,720
Okay, you have equipped monster skin.

712
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,160
Okay.

713
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,340
I did it.

714
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,300
Alright, you heard the bleep sound because I did it, guys.

715
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,200
Alright.

716
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,700
Am I him now?

717
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,200
Did I do it?

718
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,820
Oh my god, I did it.

719
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,120
I...

720
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,600
But it's not over yet, guys.

721
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,760
You guys wanna know why it's not over yet?

722
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,280
Because...

723
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,160
Because...

724
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,220
I gotta wear some clothes right now.

725
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,200
I got...

726
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,040
Because it's time to...

727
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,500
Wait, where's my character?

728
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,500
Where's Sans Undertale?

729
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,460
Oh my god.

730
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,020
Wait.

731
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,360
Where is he?

732
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,120
Where is he?

733
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,100
Okay, create character.

734
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,080
Select from...

735
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,680
Where did he go?

736
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,580
Wait.

737
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,820
I spent all that time.

738
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,920
I can't put clothes on him?

739
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,080
What's the point?

740
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:25,880
What?

741
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,800
Wait a minute.

742
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,760
Wait a minute.

743
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,640
Wait a minute.

744
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,760
I'm a little concerned here.

745
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,260
I spent all that money, but where can I put clothes on him?

746
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,320
Excuse me.

747
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,520
Why can't I put clothes on my Sans Undertale?

748
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,000
I...

749
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,160
Are you serious?

750
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,980
I can't put clothes on my Sans Undertale?

751
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,630
No!

752
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,210
I was gonna put...

753
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,520
I'm so sad.

754
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,280
I've never been so sad before.

755
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,780
I was so ready to...

756
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,440
I was so ready to give him clothes.

757
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:01,920
I...

758
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,680
Oh my god.

759
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,640
I was like, oh my god.

760
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,380
I cannot wait.

761
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,880
I cannot wait...

762
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,740
To put clothes on my Sans Undertale.

763
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,220
Because down here...

764
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,960
Down here...

765
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,820
I can buy Sanrio clothes.

766
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,080
And I was so excited.

767
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,980
Because I was like, oh my god.

768
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,060
I cannot wait.

769
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,000
I...

770
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,820
I cannot...

771
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,080
I can't believe it.

772
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,000
We spent...

773
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,740
20 minutes looking at skins.

774
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,240
And I can't even put my Cinnamoroll...

775
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,500
I'm still gonna buy it.

776
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,440
I'm still...

777
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,080
I'm still gonna buy it.

778
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,120
I don't care.

779
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,960
I want my Cinnamoroll ears.

780
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,500
I don't care.

781
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,780
And then I'll buy...

782
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,200
Oh my god.

783
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,620
I could be...

784
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,780
Wait, can I wear...

785
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,120
This and...

786
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,840
This over it?

787
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,120
Can I wear the hood...

788
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,560
The clothes over it?

789
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,120
But like, I could...

790
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,060
I could...

791
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,700
Oh my god.

792
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,000
I could have been saying...

793
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,760
I'm only one IP at a time.

794
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,200
I'm still gonna...

795
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,380
Oh, this is free.

796
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,420
I'll buy this.

797
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,080
It's free.

798
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,820
Okay.

799
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:07,760
Alright.

800
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,080
It's okay.

801
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,820
It's okay.

802
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,940
I'm fine.

803
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,340
It's alright.

804
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,600
It's okay.

805
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,260
I know that...

806
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,980
I guess I'll make my own character, I guess.

807
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,720
No.

808
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,660
It's okay.

809
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,820
You don't need this.

810
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,980
You don't need this.

811
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,800
You get to be Sans Undertale.

812
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,380
Who cares?

813
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,820
You get to be Sans Undertale.

814
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,140
It's okay.

815
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
I get to be Sans Undertale.

816
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,780
It's alright.

817
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,320
It's okay.

818
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,680
You get to be something better.

819
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,360
You get to be something better.

820
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,880
Where the fuck is...

821
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,220
Okay, I cannot deal with the sensitivity for this.

822
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,020
Alright.

823
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,100
Seventeen.

824
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,060
Let's figure this out.

825
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,520
Video.

826
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,860
Full screen.

827
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,680
Alright, that's a lot better now.

828
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,640
Now that we're full screen, I feel a lot better.

829
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
Okay, let me fix...

830
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,820
Let me fix the screen real quick.

831
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,500
Okay.

832
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,000
Wait, how is this...

833
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,920
This is not full screen.

834
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,920
Wait, what?

835
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,800
Am I full screen now?

836
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,400
Okay, there we go.

837
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,520
There we go.

838
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,380
That should be perfect.

839
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:23,760
Alright.

840
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,640
Hide paper.

841
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,580
Hide HUD.

842
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,480
Oh yeah, we got...

843
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,960
Camera shake.

844
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,100
View bobbing.

845
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,080
Where's the...

846
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,260
Oh, Jesus Christ.

847
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:34,880
This...

848
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,620
Where's the FOV?

849
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,460
Oh my God.

850
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,300
This is so weird.

851
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,640
What FOV do we use?

852
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,060
I don't remember.

853
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,400
What's a good...

854
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,880
Sorry.

855
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,340
What's a good FOV...

856
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,600
For Bedrock?

857
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,480
No, it's because it's Bedrock, guys!

858
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,560
It's Bedrock!

859
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,260
Everything is reset, guys!

860
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,660
You think I actually want to play on...

861
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,440
Okay, 95.

862
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,860
Okay, I'll do 90.

863
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,280
Who plays Bedrock?

864
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,260
Well, um...

865
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,500
We are playing Hello Kitty, okay?

866
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,280
We're playing Hello Kitty.

867
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,760
That's why we're here.

868
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,420
Alright.

869
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,120
There we go.

870
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,140
Oh, that looks so weird, man.

871
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,400
It looks so weird on, like, 90.

872
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,980
Oh my God, it's like little cupcakes.

873
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,100
Oh my, finally.

874
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
I'm finally gonna leave.

875
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,640
I'm finally gonna leave this place.

876
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,080
Hello, Hello Kitty!

877
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,560
Okay, give me a sec.

878
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,080
I cannot...

879
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,880
90 is so weird.

880
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,600
90...

881
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,240
90 is so weird in Bedrock.

882
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,060
I can't lie.

883
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,680
Like, there's something off.

884
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,900
There's something off.

885
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,280
That's...

886
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,500
That's...

887
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,300
There's something weird right now.

888
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,100
I cannot explain it.

889
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,740
There's something weird in Bedrock 90.

890
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,060
Like, I don't know what...

891
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,080
How to explain it.

892
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,520
Okay, let's get this camera sensitivity.

893
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,680
Hello, Hello Kitty!

894
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,340
Hello, you're finally...

895
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,580
Sorry, I was too busy trying to become Sans.

896
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
You're finally here!

897
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,180
We've been expecting your arrival!

898
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,380
I'm Hello Kitty.

899
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,780
Welcome to our town.

900
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,260
Everyone is super excited to meet you.

901
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,820
It's all anyone's been talking about lately.

902
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,880
A real farmer!

903
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,280
That's super cool!

904
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
I'm sure we can all learn a lot from each other.

905
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,280
I thought you could use a few pointers to get you started with your new life on the farm.

906
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,940
Follow me!

907
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,320
Hello, Hello Kitty!

908
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,400
This is your crop field.

909
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,700
You can grow all kinds of delicious veggies and fruits here.

910
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,680
Some crops grow year-round and others can only be grown during certain seasons.

911
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,240
Spring is the season for strawberries, for example.

912
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,880
You'll need to buy some seeds, sow them in these planters, and make sure to water them every day.

913
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,160
This is basically Harvest Moon.

914
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,860
Harvest Moon for $10.

915
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,900
Before you know it, you have a fully grown plant.

916
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,480
Here's your barn.

917
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,000
It's where you keep your animals.

918
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,960
You don't inherently have animals, but when you do, they'll live in there.

919
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,200
All you have to do is put an order for an animal over at Kawaii Mart...

920
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,460
and I'll make sure to have your new friend delivered straight to your barn.

921
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,500
Convenient, isn't it?

922
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,420
I strive to give only the best service.

923
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,520
Come along!

924
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,200
We still have a lot to cover.

925
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,600
Alright.

926
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,100
I don't care about you, Hello Kitty.

927
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,220
Where can I meet my Oshii-san tomorrow?

928
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,380
Next, we're going up this way.

929
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,640
That's where we'll find the mines.

930
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,000
What?

931
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,620
What do you mean the mines?

932
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,840
In my Minecraft game?

933
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,420
Here it is, the entrance to the mine.

934
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,920
Make sure you visit the mine frequently to collect iron and stone.

935
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,400
You're going to need a lot for them if you plan to expand your farmhouse.

936
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,680
We yearn for the mine.

937
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,580
That's what they're doing in the Minecraft movie.

938
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,560
Steve was just a kid that really wanted to mine.

939
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,520
And you'll get there in no time.

940
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,320
Speaking of expanding your house, let's run back down to the farm.

941
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,680
I need to show you one last thing before we head to the town.

942
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:13,640
Alright.

943
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,300
Remember I mentioned upgrading your house?

944
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,140
That's what the board here is for.

945
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,460
This is the house upgrade board.

946
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,880
Sometime in the future, you'll be able to get your hands on blueprints.

947
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,300
Blueprints will help you plan for future home upgrades and expansions.

948
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,860
When you obtain or buy a blueprint, you'll be able to refer to this board...

949
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,320
and see what materials you'll need to upgrade your house and visualize your progress.

950
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,660
Upgrading your house will require wood, iron, and stone.

951
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,180
Interacting with the board will allow you to store any materials you get...

952
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,740
so you don't have to lug them around.

953
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,080
With that cleared up, let's take a little tour...

954
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,920
Oh my god, I can meet Simbaro!

955
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,500
Move out of the way, kitty!

956
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,240
Oh my god, she won't let me move.

957
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,040
We're almost at the town.

958
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,380
We're doing a tiny pit stop here.

959
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,820
Move out of the way, kitty!

960
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,560
See the stairs on your left?

961
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,460
That's where the lumber yard is.

962
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,560
Let's go take a peek, shall we?

963
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,860
Soon...

964
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,480
Is this... In this woodsy area...

965
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,700
I'm gonna push her down, just to get to Maushi.

966
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,100
You'll be able to collect wood from fallen logs.

967
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,840
Feel free to chop up any fallen logs you'll find.

968
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,080
You'll need an axe for that.

969
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,200
I can't chop the trees?

970
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,080
I have to chop...

971
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,380
Oh my god, Kurumi!

972
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,960
Let me out!

973
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,220
I need to talk to her!

974
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,980
We're here.

975
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,220
Welcome to town!

976
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,760
More accurately, welcome to the town square.

977
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,960
This is the hub for everyone and everything happening in the valley.

978
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,540
The town square is where we hold all our seasonal festivals...

979
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,960
and celebrations.

980
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,500
Do make sure you come by the town square when a festival is happening.

981
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,020
I think you'll enjoy them.

982
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,720
I'm sure it will make everyone else happy too.

983
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,380
We're actually having a spring celebration on day 8 of the season.

984
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,280
Don't forget!

985
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,300
Hopefully we'll see you there!

986
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,200
No!

987
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,500
Bring me back!

988
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,780
Kurumi!

989
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,800
Our town store.

990
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,680
It's as cute as its given name, which I came up with myself, by the way.

991
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,780
This is your go-to quick stop for everything and anything you'll ever need.

992
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,220
Now furniture...

993
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,120
Oh my god, Kurumi!

994
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,400
Oh my god, she's right in front of me!

995
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,180
She's right there!

996
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,480
We'll be known to sell new...

997
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Please come by whenever you need to do some shopping.

998
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,140
We're open every day, even on the festival days.

999
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,540
The only days we don't open is when the weather is particularly bad.

1000
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,280
But then, you shouldn't be going out anyway.

1001
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,640
Better stay home and redecorate or something.

1002
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,300
Anywho, that's the end of our tour.

1003
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,640
I'll walk you back home.

1004
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,860
Kurumi, no!

1005
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,320
Don't walk me home!

1006
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,540
Ah, Kurumi!

1007
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,360
What is this?

1008
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,160
We are home sweet home.

1009
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,920
I know that was a lot of information in a small amount of time.

1010
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,420
But you'll get the hang of everything on your own, I promise.

1011
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,020
Before I leave, I have a few housewarming presents for you.

1012
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,920
That's so fucked up, Hello Kitty.

1013
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,040
How dare you, like, show me Kurumi and then took her away from me.

1014
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,800
She ripped her out of my fucking hands.

1015
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,240
A brand new watering can, a hoe, pickaxe, and axe.

1016
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,860
This will help you get started.

1017
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:38,220
And to make extra sure that I don't have you in a state of confusion, I prepared this neat little tablet with any and all information you need about the town and life on the farm.

1018
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,660
I gotta run back to Kawaii Mark now.

1019
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,480
Is this what we dragoons sound like when we see TokiCats?

1020
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,660
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1021
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,520
I'll be seeing you around.

1022
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,640
Bye bye!

1023
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,080
Oh my god, it's like pink, too.

1024
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,060
What the fuck?

1025
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,520
Okay.

1026
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,120
What is this?

1027
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,860
Is this a tablet?

1028
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,780
What is this?

1029
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,460
Okay, so like, I can actually farm?

1030
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,160
How do I...

1031
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,100
Is this already...

1032
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,900
Okay.

1033
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,120
Okay.

1034
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,860
Alright.

1035
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,080
Okay, let me put some lettuce down.

1036
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,020
And then...

1037
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,700
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

1038
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,700
Alright, I did it.

1039
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,580
Can I make Koro-mi now?

1040
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,800
Don't take me away from Koro-mi.

1041
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,480
Don't take her away from me!

1042
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,660
Oh!

1043
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,100
Oh!

1044
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,380
I have level zero friendship weather.

1045
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,840
Today is sunny.

1046
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,980
I can't believe it.

1047
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,300
They took her away from me.

1048
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,640
What do I do?

1049
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,360
Okay.

1050
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,580
So I can chop wood.

1051
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,300
And then I have to...

1052
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,600
Oh wait, I should refill this.

1053
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,480
How do I refill this?

1054
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,020
Okay, no, that's me watering it.

1055
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,580
Hello kitty, you did not teach me this game.

1056
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,100
Like, I...

1057
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,140
She didn't even teach me how to fucking refill my watering can.

1058
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,840
Like, I can't even...

1059
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,580
Can I cut these trees?

1060
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,640
I can't even cut these trees!

1061
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,900
They're owned by Sanrio!

1062
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,700
Property owned by Sanrio.

1063
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,080
Trees cannot be cut.

1064
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,780
I can't believe it.

1065
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,960
They locked the trees.

1066
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,180
I can only cut trees that have fallen on the ground.

1067
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,460
Who lives over there?

1068
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,620
Wait, is that the town?

1069
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,340
Oh my god, that's where Hello Kitty lives.

1070
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,740
Sanrio owns them.

1071
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,520
Trees cannot be cut.

1072
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,000
I like how you can see Sans just running on the top left.

1073
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:43,860
If you have any questions, I'll compile the information myself with the help of ChocoCat.

1074
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,940
Wait, who lives up here?

1075
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,680
Knock knock, I'm here to break in.

1076
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,680
Oh my god, I'm in!

1077
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,080
Okay, wait.

1078
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,640
Does it have F5 here?

1079
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,860
Mia Maoshi.

1080
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,360
Mia Maoshi.

1081
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,480
Get over here.

1082
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,020
Sans Undertale and his Oshi.

1083
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,900
Don't leave!

1084
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,080
Where are you going?

1085
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,120
Saburo, where did he go?

1086
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,240
Where did he go?

1087
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,440
That's right.

1088
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,100
Mia Maoshi right here.

1089
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,780
I broke into my Oshi's home.

1090
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,880
But that's okay.

1091
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,280
That's not okay.

1092
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,340
Oh my god!

1093
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,640
Do you love your Oshi enough to not break into your Oshi's house?

1094
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,800
But like, it's different.

1095
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,340
Oh my god!

1096
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,900
Oh my god!

1097
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,500
Oh my god!

1098
00:40:59,560 --> 00:40:59,780
Oh my god!

1099
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,300
Calm down!

1100
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,980
Calm down!

1101
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,380
Stay away from him!

1102
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,880
What do you mean I'm as big as a fan?!

1103
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,140
Fan!

1104
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,180
You can't say that!

1105
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,080
He loves me!

1106
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,160
He loves me!

1107
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,540
He is really...

1108
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,700
Oh my god, that's so cute!

1109
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,980
There's a little Cinnamoroll!

1110
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,620
There's a little Cinnamoroll plushie!

1111
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,660
Oh my god!

1112
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,000
Do you think he'll notice if I take something from his house?

1113
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,420
Aw, he might not.

1114
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,540
Oh my god, he's calling the police!

1115
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,960
Going up to Cinnamoroll and asks, I love you.

1116
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,220
Oh my god, he has merch of himself!

1117
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,140
He's just like me!

1118
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,600
His entire home is designed out!

1119
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,100
His entire home is just merchandise of himself!

1120
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,940
That's gonna be me if I ever get a fucking Doki Bridge couch.

1121
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,800
You know damn well I'm gonna put that on my Cinnamoroll.

1122
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,260
Oh my god, your house is beautiful, Cinnamoroll!

1123
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,860
Just don't leave this corner.

1124
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,680
Your house is so beautiful!

1125
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,760
Don't be scared!

1126
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,020
Do not be afraid!

1127
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,120
I'm your number one fan!

1128
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,460
Do not be afraid!

1129
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,180
Do not be afraid, Cinnamoroll!

1130
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,360
Alright.

1131
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,780
Alright, I gotta meet my Oshie.

1132
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,500
Don't do it!

1133
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,980
I gotta meet my Oshie!

1134
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,360
Oh my god, his house is so cute!

1135
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,400
There's like bullets!

1136
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,720
Do not be afraid!

1137
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,400
Alright, let's see if I can find Kuromi's house.

1138
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,700
I feel like that's definitely not.

1139
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh, that has to be like the twins, the star twins.

1140
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,380
Oh my god!

1141
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,520
Look at this fucking hunk of a man!

1142
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,320
You should come over sometime.

1143
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,660
I have a really cool bowtie collection.

1144
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,400
I'm sure you would appreciate.

1145
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,080
Oh, hi there, Cinnamoroll!

1146
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,680
Clouds make for the best nap spots.

1147
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,780
Oh my god, look!

1148
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,120
He followed me.

1149
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,440
Look at this absolute unit there.

1150
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,520
Can't wait for the next pumpkin carving!

1151
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,120
Make sure to try your hardest!

1152
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,260
I'm a fun but picky judge!

1153
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,200
He's not afraid!

1154
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,980
See, he came to me!

1155
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,120
Guys, he came to me!

1156
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,260
Okay, guys?

1157
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:12,980
Alright?

1158
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,060
He is my friend now.

1159
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,900
Okay, is that... which one could be Karomi's house?

1160
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,760
I feel like Karomi's house would be black though.

1161
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,760
But like... Oh, there's my melody.

1162
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,780
Fuck off.

1163
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,840
I don't... Oh, wait, hey!

1164
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,840
There's Batsmots...

1165
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,080
Batsimaru.

1166
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,200
I've been thinking.

1167
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,480
You're pretty cool, right?

1168
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,380
But you know what would make you look even cooler?

1169
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,220
Join the exclusive Rad Riders Scooter Club!

1170
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,580
It's only the coolest club in town.

1171
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,460
People will ooh and ah when they see you drive by.

1172
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,260
Wow, I wish I was part of the Rad Riders Scooter Club.

1173
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,960
It's so exclusive.

1174
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,960
It only has one member at the moment.

1175
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,620
Me, a president and founder, Batsimaru.

1176
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,080
And by presidential degree, I selected you to be my number two pretty sweet offer.

1177
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,700
To make you an official member, we gotta get you your own... Oh my god, I want my own scooter!

1178
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,120
I just got a brand new one recently, so I can give you my old scoop.

1179
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,880
See that scooter by my garage?

1180
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,080
It's all yours.

1181
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Can y'all believe it?

1182
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,400
It's a lucky day.

1183
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,560
It's not in the best shape though.

1184
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,280
I may have been a bit rough on it over the years, but it's nothing a good scrub and fresh layer of paint can fix.

1185
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,160
I guess there's also a small detail of it needing some new wheels.

1186
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,440
But hey, if you can bring me some paint and a new set of rollers, I can fix it up.

1187
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,500
Aw, I got you.

1188
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,740
Guys, we need that scooter.

1189
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,440
Okay, Batsu... Oh, this has to be Koromi's house!

1190
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,840
It's goth as fuck!

1191
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,960
That has to be her house.

1192
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,580
Knock knock.

1193
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,680
Don't worry about the axe in my head.

1194
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,600
Knock knock.

1195
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,840
Oh my god!

1196
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,900
She has a fucking...

1197
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,320
Wait, what the fuck?

1198
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,120
Why did she...

1199
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,880
Bro, she's rich as fuck.

1200
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,540
Netherite armor, right?

1201
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,140
Why does she have Netherite armor?

1202
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,840
Oh, I like how like the music came down the entire Netherite.

1203
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,160
Oh, she's a gamer.

1204
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,180
She's a gamer gamer.

1205
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,340
She actually has Netherite armor.

1206
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,080
Hello, Koromi.

1207
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,740
Oh my god, Tsunomoro doesn't even have a goddamn kitchen!

1208
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,900
He lives in the slums!

1209
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,520
See you again.

1210
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,460
Oh, I'll be here definitely for sure.

1211
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,520
Okay, this is Oshi number two.

1212
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,000
My Tsunomoro is my Kamiyoshi.

1213
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,180
But like...

1214
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,120
I don't like that perspective.

1215
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:36,460
But...

1216
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,520
No, Koromi is way too pure for that.

1217
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,840
Koromi... Oh, it looks like I'm peeking in.

1218
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,040
Like I'm a little peeker.

1219
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,740
Peeping Tom.

1220
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,220
And I'm looking and I see Koromi and Sans under there.

1221
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,060
Do not be afraid.

1222
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,800
This is me and my Oshi.

1223
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,440
Oshi number two.

1224
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,780
Not my Kamiyoshi, but me and my Oshi right here.

1225
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:58,980
Look at that.

1226
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,520
Alright.

1227
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,660
No, Koromi, please.

1228
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,220
Please don't run away, Koromi, please.

1229
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,220
Please don't run away.

1230
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,000
Don't be...

1231
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,760
Don't run away.

1232
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,020
Don't run away, Koromi.

1233
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,440
I'm just trying to take a photo.

1234
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,000
Oshi number two.

1235
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,380
Okay, there you go.

1236
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,980
She just wants to feel tall, guys.

1237
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:16,660
That's really it.

1238
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,440
She wants to feel tall.

1239
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,980
Please, Koromi, don't run.

1240
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,480
Don't run.

1241
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,380
There you go.

1242
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,300
Oh my god, guys.

1243
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,980
Did you guys take a photo of me and my Oshi?

1244
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,780
Oh, why are you hiding?

1245
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,300
Koromi, why are you hiding?

1246
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:28,420
Why?

1247
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,500
Oh my god.

1248
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,060
I get to be in my Oshi's house.

1249
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,380
I got invited.

1250
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,800
She welcomed me in her home, guys.

1251
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,760
Oh, her house is so cute, though.

1252
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,720
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1253
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,600
Welcome, welcome.

1254
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,960
She welcomed me to her home.

1255
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,380
Oh my god, there's like a playground, too.

1256
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,740
That's so cute.

1257
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,700
There's like hopscotch.

1258
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,240
Hello, Tsunamoro.

1259
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,500
Hello.

1260
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,880
Hello.

1261
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,540
You want me to put you on the swing?

1262
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,760
Come on.

1263
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,400
Come on.

1264
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,300
Go on the swing.

1265
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,820
That's right.

1266
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,640
Wait, I can...

1267
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,020
I mean, I could...

1268
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,800
You were not invited.

1269
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,880
I feel a little weird being in a playground.

1270
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:13,680
Let me leave.

1271
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,400
I don't want to...

1272
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,340
Oh, there's Koromi!

1273
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,980
I feel a little weird trying to kidnap Tsunamoro in the playground.

1274
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,220
I'm...

1275
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:25,960
I'm singing some tunes.

1276
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:26,720
Who is here?

1277
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,780
Oh, is this Helikitty's sister?

1278
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,000
Oh, this is my melody?

1279
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,980
Fucking hate you.

1280
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,720
You'll never be like your sister.

1281
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,440
You'll never be like her.

1282
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,160
Koromi!

1283
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:55,380
I'm like that like the crazy the crazy fan outside her window.

1284
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,640
Koromi is better than you in every way.

1285
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,280
You'll never be like her.

1286
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,080
Get out.

1287
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,140
Leave this town, Melody.

1288
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,740
She's better than you.

1289
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,300
I'm the auntie.

1290
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,440
That's right.

1291
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,620
That's right.

1292
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,580
Koromi is better than you in every way.

1293
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,740
I like Melody.

1294
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,400
Sometimes we get heatwaves during the summer season.

1295
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,780
It's best to stay indoors and not risk getting heatstroke.

1296
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,800
So be mindful.

1297
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,380
That's right!

1298
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,660
Move out of this town!

1299
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,260
You're not welcome here.

1300
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,420
An auntie, a hater, and I'm gonna throw eggs at her ass.

1301
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,500
Who lives here?

1302
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,020
Hello?

1303
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,160
What the fuck?

1304
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,680
Who lives here?

1305
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,700
Oh, is that Batsumaru?

1306
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,060
Oh my god, he's a gamer!

1307
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,160
Wow, look at his PC!

1308
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,180
Oh my god, he has a gamer chair too!

1309
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,160
Wait!

1310
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,020
He actually has a gamer chair!

1311
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,420
Oh my god!

1312
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,280
He's a goddamn gamer!

1313
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,040
Yeah!

1314
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,160
He's got the whole setup and everything.

1315
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,400
Wait, I can like sit on his table.

1316
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,440
Oh my god!

1317
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,520
He's a fucking gamer!

1318
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,580
Look at him.

1319
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,460
No wonder he likes me so much.

1320
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,640
He has the Marvel Rivals logo on his chair.

1321
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,600
Wait, here.

1322
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,340
He is like the only one with a PC too.

1323
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,140
I'm gonna steal his setup.

1324
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,640
Oh no, it's night time.

1325
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,540
Wait, I'm not done!

1326
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,380
I'm not done!

1327
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,100
Going into people's houses!

1328
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,340
Who lives here?

1329
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,260
Knock knock!

1330
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,160
Anyone notice that the relationship between Kuromi and Melody are similar to Spongebob and Squidward?

1331
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,760
Yeah, I'm thinking for the super chat.

1332
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,740
Oh my god, is this ChocoCat's house?

1333
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,400
Your house is so...

1334
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,340
Your house is so generic.

1335
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,120
Oh my god!

1336
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,380
Fucking nerd!

1337
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,680
Oh my god!

1338
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,220
He's a goddamn nerd!

1339
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,780
He has a calc... He has a TI-87 calculator here and everything.

1340
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,100
There's like a science kid here.

1341
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:12,840
He has a toaster.

1342
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:13,740
Wait, where is he?

1343
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,080
Oh, you try to hide.

1344
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:15,880
That's right.

1345
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,200
Who are you hiding from, huh?

1346
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,920
Who are you hiding from?

1347
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:20,720
That's right.

1348
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,400
Who are you hiding from?

1349
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,420
No!

1350
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,400
Heya!

1351
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,780
Let this cat go!

1352
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,020
Let the cat go!

1353
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,240
Doki!

1354
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,580
Let him go!

1355
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,300
That's right.

1356
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,060
Why are you hiding?

1357
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,800
Maybe a home intruder?

1358
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,600
It's like, oh my god, he won't know.

1359
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,220
Please!

1360
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,440
Please help!

1361
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,100
Please!

1362
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,640
No one will save you.

1363
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,380
No one will save you.

1364
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,720
I'm in your home now.

1365
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,360
Dude, don't bully.

1366
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,720
Get back to your corner, ChocoCat.

1367
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,180
Go back to your...

1368
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,060
Go back to... Oh, you're trying to run?

1369
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:54,920
Oh, go back.

1370
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,180
Go to this other corner.

1371
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,700
That's right, ChocoCat.

1372
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,800
Leave the cat alone.

1373
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,760
It's him.

1374
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:01,780
It's him.

1375
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,420
I'm so sorry.

1376
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,860
If they didn't want me to invade their homes, they wouldn't have let me in in the first place.

1377
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,960
He's just a chill cat.

1378
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,220
Alright, who lives... Oh wait, that's the market.

1379
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,780
Is it open right now?

1380
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,000
Hello, hello, kit...

1381
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,360
Oh, that's so cute!

1382
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:35,260
They use, like, the levers and the light...

1383
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,180
I like to buy stuff.

1384
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,180
Oh!

1385
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,580
Wait, that's so cute!

1386
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,900
I can buy bees!

1387
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,500
And milk!

1388
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,000
2005.

1389
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,400
How much money do I have?

1390
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,360
I don't even know how much money I have.

1391
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,500
It doesn't even tell me.

1392
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,160
Hello Kitty, how much money do I have right now?

1393
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,400
How much money do I have, Hello Kitty?

1394
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,960
Wait, can I buy bees right now?

1395
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,440
Oh, technically I can.

1396
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,160
Okay.

1397
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,640
I'll buy...

1398
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,380
Wait, but what's this?

1399
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,340
Oh, I have zero?

1400
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,100
Oh, I don't have enough gems?

1401
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:20,860
Okay.

1402
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,960
Alright, I thought I had more.

1403
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,420
Oh no, I'm slow.

1404
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,660
I'm getting tired.

1405
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,180
I'm getting so tired.

1406
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:31,920
I can buy a chair.

1407
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,200
Oh, these are like furniture.

1408
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,480
Wait, what's this?

1409
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,940
Did I buy it?

1410
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,340
I just... I didn't know what it is.

1411
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,740
Wait, did I buy it?

1412
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:49,980
Did I...

1413
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,060
Did I accidentally bought this?

1414
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,060
No!

1415
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,620
I'm passed out!

1416
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,500
No!

1417
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,400
I did that!

1418
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,950
Alright, now I have some balls.

1419
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,410
I'm so sad.

1420
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,630
I'm so sad.

1421
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:23,170
I didn't want to buy these stupid balls.

1422
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,410
I shoplifted and I passed out.

1423
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,970
I'm so sad.

1424
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:33,010
I wanted to save my money for bees.

1425
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,390
I wanted bees!

1426
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,970
Oh shit, I have a crafting table.

1427
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,730
I don't... Wait, I don't have a crafting table.

1428
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:44,730
Alright.

1429
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,950
I'm so sad.

1430
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,150
Imazayer, thank you for the superchat.

1431
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,330
Thank you, thank you!

1432
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:52,730
I'm happy that your team won.

1433
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,910
Thank you for your first superchat!

1434
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,970
Thank you, thank you!

1435
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:55,670
Thank you!

1436
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,550
I'm really happy my team won, too.

1437
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:03,610
I also got invited... Oh, we have... I got invited to this guy's Toast Marble Rivals tournament, too.

1438
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,290
I won't say the date because I don't think they announced it yet.

1439
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:07,650
But yeah, I'm super looking forward.

1440
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:08,870
I can actually play in a tournament.

1441
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,650
I got the invitation today.

1442
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,530
Alright, back to like...

1443
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:18,910
Back to breaking... Not... Getting invited to like my Oshie's houses.

1444
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,410
I'm going back in.

1445
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,750
I'm not done.

1446
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:22,910
I'm not done, guys.

1447
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,650
I know this is a... Oh, I don't care about...

1448
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,790
Oh, actually, I want to see what HowlKitty's home looks like.

1449
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:29,430
It's raining and I'm gonna be like, knock knock.

1450
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:30,510
Let me in.

1451
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,530
Why is her house so much bigger than everybody else?

1452
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,690
What is this?

1453
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,430
What is this privilege?

1454
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:50,230
Why does HowlKitty get to have a bigger house than all the other Sanrio characters, huh?

1455
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,010
That's so messed up.

1456
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,270
Why does she... She gets the best view and everything.

1457
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,390
Why does she have all the privilege?

1458
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,930
She's the main character.

1459
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,710
No, she's not.

1460
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,190
Cinnamoroll is the main character.

1461
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:10,810
Oh, this is the absolute... The absolute chunky penguin boy.

1462
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,030
Oh, that's so sad.

1463
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,590
All he has is a fucking radio for entertainment.

1464
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,270
That's so sad.

1465
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,330
Hello, this game seems fun.

1466
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,370
I wonder if we can allow it with the rest of the games.

1467
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:22,870
Right, man.

1468
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:23,770
Thank you for the super chat.

1469
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,170
Thank you.

1470
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,850
Thank you.

1471
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:28,550
I think the cool thing about Bedrock is the customization is really nice.

1472
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:34,310
I like how his only form of entertainment is like a god damn radio.

1473
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:35,370
He's old.

1474
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,490
He's so... He's old.

1475
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:42,450
Papa Puddin!

1476
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,390
Oh my god, I'm gonna...

1477
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:45,070
Oh my god!

1478
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:45,970
Oh, she's number three!

1479
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:46,650
Why are you running?

1480
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,190
They're like, oh no, she's zombie.

1481
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:49,990
Oh no.

1482
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:51,470
What do I do?

1483
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,230
What now?

1484
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,110
I ran... Oh, you have to help.

1485
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,530
Look, see, I'm a friend.

1486
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:56,730
Not parasocial or anything.

1487
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,170
He called me friend first.

1488
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,310
Guys, he called me friend first.

1489
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,330
I did something, mistakes were made.

1490
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:03,910
They grabbed him.

1491
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,450
They were there and then they weren't.

1492
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:11,870
I want to hold a delicious pudding party and invite everyone to have a taste of my homemade pudding.

1493
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,970
It's a special recipe.

1494
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:15,690
My mom taught me how to make.

1495
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:16,930
It's truly amazing.

1496
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:19,490
The jiggle, the texture, the flavor.

1497
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:21,670
Oh no!

1498
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,830
Everyone seems so excited.

1499
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,430
They expected our friends to come by soon.

1500
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,230
So I got working and made the jiggliest, softest pudding.

1501
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,990
But one thing led to another.

1502
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,850
I wanted to make sure that taste was perfect.

1503
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:36,850
I had a little taste and then a little lick.

1504
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,250
I was delicious and I blinked.

1505
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,170
I don't know what happened, but it's all gone.

1506
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,470
Oh no.

1507
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,150
What am I going to do?

1508
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,410
Wait, of course, you have a farm.

1509
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,190
Oh, friend.

1510
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:47,250
Friend.

1511
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,730
Guys, friend.

1512
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:53,650
Remember.

1513
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,970
You have to help me.

1514
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,770
Could you bring me five bottles of milk?

1515
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:07,690
Fresh milk is the key to whipping up my special pudding with another...

1516
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,770
So I could make another batch in no time.

1517
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,010
Leave it to me.

1518
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,270
Guys, guys, he said I'm his friend.

1519
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:16,930
Guys, he said friend.

1520
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,150
He said...

1521
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:24,070
Oh my God, his chairs are pudding themed!

1522
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,650
I'm so cute!

1523
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,170
Oh my God!

1524
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:34,230
His entire decor is just pudding because he's Pom Pom Pudding.

1525
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,290
He's like the chef.

1526
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:36,750
Does he...

1527
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,010
He has a bottle!

1528
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,290
I see it!

1529
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:43,250
Toki, why are you bending down?

1530
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:46,390
Guys, guys, I just want to see that bottle.

1531
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,950
Pom Pom Pudding's like, excuse me, um...

1532
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,350
Why are you looking?

1533
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,410
He has the bottle!

1534
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:55,990
See?

1535
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:59,910
Look at that, it's right there, Toki.

1536
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,570
It's what he's known for!

1537
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:05,690
Like Pom Pom Pudding has a little, like, extra butt.

1538
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,550
Guys, it's actually what he's known for.

1539
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,110
Toki, stop.

1540
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,130
He's scared of you.

1541
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:16,650
No!

1542
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,170
He said friend!

1543
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,810
He said friend, guys.

1544
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,310
He said friend first.

1545
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,430
Oh, and this is Kiropi's house.

1546
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:26,930
It's canonical!

1547
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:27,950
Yes!

1548
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,870
Oh, you try to hide.

1549
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:30,610
Ooh, a visitor.

1550
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:31,810
You try to hide there.

1551
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:32,730
You think I didn't see you?

1552
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,190
Oh my God, that's so cute.

1553
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,590
The little bow ties and everything.

1554
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,950
Oh, he's like...

1555
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,310
He likes to do karaoke.

1556
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:40,090
Oh yeah, he likes to sing because he's a frontman.

1557
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,370
And everything.

1558
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,430
Oh, his house is pretty cute.

1559
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,410
I also would say...

1560
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,370
I don't have my axe out!

1561
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:50,670
Now I do.

1562
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,170
And this is...

1563
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,210
Oh, I forgot his name.

1564
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:55,490
I don't like this guy.

1565
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:56,970
I don't like him.

1566
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:58,610
It's a little weird.

1567
00:58:59,310 --> 00:58:59,630
Hang...

1568
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:00,510
Hang Yodon?

1569
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,030
Oh my goodness, visitor.

1570
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,250
That's not to say this isn't a good surprise.

1571
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:05,670
It's a wonderful surprise.

1572
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:06,390
It's great.

1573
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:06,890
Amazing.

1574
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,090
Welcome to my humble little home by the water.

1575
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:10,070
Oh my goodness, visitor.

1576
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,190
What do I do now?

1577
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:11,550
Tea?

1578
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,050
Cake?

1579
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,370
I don't have any of that.

1580
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,170
Get a grip, Hang Yodon.

1581
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,570
You're a host, yes.

1582
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:18,790
Farmer friend.

1583
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:24,370
It's only right that as your first time visiting, I give you the most amazing guest experience you have ever experienced.

1584
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,770
And all of your experiences.

1585
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,350
You'll have so much fun, you won't be able to help telling everyone about it.

1586
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,250
It's so fun going to Hang Yodon's place.

1587
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,490
There's no place like it.

1588
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:38,090
What a host!

1589
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:38,750
What a guy!

1590
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,770
Anyway, let's play a little game.

1591
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:48,330
I call it, dive deep to the bottom of the lake and retrieve the special limited edition Hang Yodon's action figure.

1592
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:50,630
Yep, that lake there.

1593
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:51,990
It will be fun.

1594
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:55,370
Oh, I can't wait to see the glimmer in your eyes with all the fun you'll have.

1595
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,370
Well, don't let me keep you off.

1596
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:58,390
I'll wait here.

1597
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,970
Okay, want me to dive into that lake?

1598
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:02,950
Wait, what's in this lake?

1599
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:06,150
Oh my God, how do I see anything?

1600
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,070
I'm gonna kill you.

1601
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,210
I'm gonna kill all the fishes in this lake.

1602
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:14,890
Wait, where is he?

1603
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,090
Okay, I need to go back up.

1604
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:21,010
I need to find a special item in this lake.

1605
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,050
He wants me to drown.

1606
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,990
He's like, Hang Yodon!

1607
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,070
You're our only hope for Sanrio Village!

1608
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:29,750
Get rid of this monster!

1609
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,450
And then he's like, don't worry.

1610
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:40,790
Citizens, I shall send her on to a quest and then she'll drown.

1611
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,970
And I shall be a hero.

1612
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:45,810
That's been here, right?

1613
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,130
There's a cave here.

1614
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:48,590
Oh, there it is.

1615
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,290
Nice, I got it.

1616
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:55,470
Little do they know, I'm gonna finish this quest with understood.

1617
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:56,650
I got a plan.

1618
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:57,670
Alright.

1619
01:00:58,370 --> 01:00:59,930
Hello, I found it.

1620
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,630
Oh, you thought you got a plan?

1621
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:03,110
But little does he know.

1622
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,450
Little does he know.

1623
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:07,650
I found a figure.

1624
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:10,890
That's right.

1625
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,950
He didn't expect me to complete the mission.

1626
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:14,270
You returned!

1627
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:15,430
How?

1628
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,650
So how was it?

1629
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:18,950
You don't have to be shy.

1630
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,710
It was the most fun you've had in a while, right?

1631
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,870
Your clothes seem a little soggy, but that should take care of itself, right?

1632
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:26,290
Haha!

1633
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,230
I think I once heard something about wet socks.

1634
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:30,170
What was it again?

1635
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:31,790
I wouldn't know.

1636
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,010
I don't wear them, you see.

1637
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:34,790
Oh my god, bare feet.

1638
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:41,530
Anyway, I, of course, have a prize for job well done.

1639
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,750
Feast your eyes on this!

1640
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:48,550
Limited edition, super rare, trendy, and chic, Hangodon's fishing rod!

1641
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:50,070
Oh my god, I got a fishing rod!

1642
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,110
Ooh, ah!

1643
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:53,550
Try it out!

1644
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:56,870
Oh my god, I got a fishing rod now.

1645
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,370
Okay, how do I fish?

1646
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,850
Is it the same?

1647
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,450
Wait, I can't fish.

1648
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:04,050
Oh, there we go.

1649
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:06,770
Alright, fishies.

1650
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:07,790
Come on.

1651
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:09,470
What did I get?

1652
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:10,910
Wait, what?

1653
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,570
Guys, I don't know if I know how to fish.

1654
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:16,490
Do I right-click or left-click?

1655
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:17,690
Hahaha!

1656
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:22,250
Guys...

1657
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,530
Wait, I don't understand!

1658
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,350
Is it not right-click?

1659
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,350
Or is it left-click?

1660
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:36,670
Oh guys, I don't think I know how to fish.

1661
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:37,610
I don't...

1662
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:37,990
Hahaha!

1663
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:46,730
Guys, I don't think I actually know how to fish, guys.

1664
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,790
Oh, there we go, I got it!

1665
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:50,610
Oh, I got a tin can.

1666
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:51,570
Wait, I figured it out.

1667
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:53,570
I learned how to fish, guys.

1668
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,620
Oh my god!

1669
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,240
Why the fuck?

1670
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,140
Where are my actual fish?

1671
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,020
Why did I get a plushie?

1672
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:07,580
What?

1673
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,200
What is that?

1674
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,080
I don't do fish in this fucking lake!

1675
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:12,900
I'm gonna die!

1676
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,220
I'm running out of cupcakes!

1677
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,620
I'm actually gonna...

1678
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:18,500
I'm running out of cupcakes!

1679
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,420
Oh my god, it's just garbage.

1680
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,220
Who is polluting this lake?

1681
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,780
Oh, Sanrio Town.

1682
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,320
Somebody is actually polluting this lake right now.

1683
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,280
I unlocked the recipe though.

1684
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,100
What do I unlock?

1685
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,040
It's just garbage!

1686
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,280
It's literally just garbage.

1687
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,040
All I've been fishing is just garbage.

1688
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:42,080
It's actually crazy.

1689
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,760
There's only garbage in this town.

1690
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,480
I'm gonna steal Kuro-pi.

1691
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,200
There has to be...

1692
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,100
Wait, what if there's fish in Kuro-pi's pond?

1693
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,260
Is that possible?

1694
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,600
Can I steal Kuro-pi's fish in his neighborhood?

1695
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,320
No, there's no fish in Kuro-pi's pond.

1696
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:01,860
It's a dead pond.

1697
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,400
Alright, alright.

1698
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,340
You thought I wouldn't invade your house?

1699
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,620
Too late, I'm coming in.

1700
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,700
I'm just cleaning up the pollution.

1701
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,780
Oh, there's like a pearl.

1702
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,660
Oh, there's like a little octopus plushie.

1703
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,580
That's so cute.

1704
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,120
I don't know.

1705
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,420
Oh, it's like...

1706
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,720
He uses like...

1707
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,460
Oh, and there's fishes up top!

1708
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,760
I'm gonna keep breaking.

1709
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,540
It's a dead pond in Kuro-pi land.

1710
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,880
I was gonna steal his...

1711
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,140
I was gonna steal his fish.

1712
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,900
Because I couldn't find anything else.

1713
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,220
Okay, I'm starving.

1714
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,480
Like, how do I eat in this town?

1715
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,900
Anyway, like...

1716
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,720
I'm...

1717
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,940
I can't run anymore.

1718
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,480
I can't run.

1719
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,460
I'm so hungry.

1720
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,620
I'm so hungry.

1721
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,740
I looked at...

1722
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,620
I looked at this house.

1723
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,260
I looked at...

1724
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,040
I looked at Penguin house.

1725
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,820
I looked at Batsumaru house.

1726
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,500
ChocoCat.

1727
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,580
Wait, who lives here?

1728
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,680
I haven't looked at this house yet.

1729
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,820
Wait, is this ChocoCat's?

1730
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:13,680
No, that was ChocoCat.

1731
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:14,400
Who lives here?

1732
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,300
Why is it so dark?

1733
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,880
Oh, it's Pochacco!

1734
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,420
Why is your house so dark, Pochacco?

1735
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,220
Oh, look.

1736
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,500
Oh, there's the sport balls.

1737
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,400
And then he's like a sporty guy.

1738
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,820
Why don't you have food, Pochacco?

1739
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,440
I am a guest in your home.

1740
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:34,940
Where's my food?

1741
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,680
Why do you have lights out, Pochacco?

1742
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:43,200
All I've been doing is just invading people's homes.

1743
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,160
Instead of fucking farming.

1744
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:54,060
I've not been, like, doing anything else but, like, just breaking into people's houses.

1745
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:58,560
Okay, I need to sell all this junk that I have so I can buy food at the market.

1746
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,080
Hello Kitty must have food.

1747
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,440
Hello Kitty must have food for me.

1748
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,400
There's no way.

1749
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,320
Sell.

1750
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,460
Wait, can I not sell...

1751
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,320
...this junk?

1752
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,420
What the fuck do I do with...

1753
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:15,820
Wait, I can't sell this?

1754
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:20,380
What?

1755
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,800
Oh, there we go!

1756
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,420
Okay.

1757
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,580
I mean, I'll take the Batsumaru.

1758
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,720
Alright, I have 51 hearts now.

1759
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,960
But, like, how many hearts do I have in total?

1760
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,360
It doesn't even tell me how many hats I have.

1761
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,060
It's cause I bought that stupid ball.

1762
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,140
I bought that stupid fucking ball.

1763
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,540
I'm so sad.

1764
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,440
I actually could've had enough.

1765
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,240
I could've had enough for bees.

1766
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,140
I bought that stupid ball.

1767
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,540
I bought that stupid ball!

1768
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,060
So I don't have fucking bees!

1769
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,260
It's okay, I don't need bees.

1770
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,440
I don't need bees.

1771
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:10,340
Those stupid little Choco Balls.

1772
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,440
I don't need them.

1773
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,180
Okay, I think I didn't see...

1774
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,940
I didn't visit...

1775
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,040
Twin Stars.

1776
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,320
My little Twin Stars.

1777
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,160
Hello, I'm gonna go into your house, guys.

1778
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,460
Your house is next.

1779
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,400
I'm coming over.

1780
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,260
But the balls are so far.

1781
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,340
They're like...

1782
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,480
They're like in my home.

1783
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:36,260
And I'm hungry.

1784
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,820
I'm so hungry.

1785
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,840
Hi, things on the 5.

1786
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,860
I'm so very hungry.

1787
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,920
Oh my god, you still have to live in a bunk bed?

1788
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,800
I'm so sorry.

1789
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,620
I'm so sorry.

1790
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,500
Wait, but who's on the other side?

1791
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,020
Wait, what?

1792
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,020
Why is there a locked door on the other side?

1793
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,480
What secrets do you have, Lala?

1794
01:07:58,180 --> 01:07:58,820
What?

1795
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,000
What secrets do you have over there?

1796
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,980
Oh my god, Lala.

1797
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,660
What do you have over there?

1798
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:17,220
Why can't we go to the other house, Lala?

1799
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,840
That's creepy.

1800
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,280
That's a little creepy.

1801
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,560
Okay, we gotta head home.

1802
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,220
Oh no, I'm slowed.

1803
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,800
I'm hungry and I'm gonna die.

1804
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:28,940
I don't understand.

1805
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,580
How do I get food?

1806
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:33,620
Animal husbandry.

1807
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,740
Resource gathering.

1808
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:35,940
Friendship.

1809
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,440
Help and you will raise your friendship levels.

1810
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,440
Okay, but like...

1811
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,860
How do I get food?

1812
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,520
Resource gathering.

1813
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:46,840
Mining and logging.

1814
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,300
Visit the lumber yard.

1815
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,020
Oh, I don't know where any of these is.

1816
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:53,780
No!

1817
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,780
I'm heading back as fast as I can!

1818
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,780
Which is not very fast.

1819
01:08:58,860 --> 01:08:59,560
I passed out.

1820
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,040
I passed out.

1821
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:08,860
It's fine.

1822
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,220
It's alright.

1823
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,520
There has to be food in my house, right?

1824
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,240
Oh my god, I have food!

1825
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,580
Oh, the taiyaki is so cute!

1826
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,540
Alright, I'm gonna eat some onigiri.

1827
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,680
And then refill it up.

1828
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,740
Oh, that is so cute though!

1829
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,660
I'm gonna get my boba tea.

1830
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,240
Okay, there we go.

1831
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,240
A boba!

1832
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,400
It's so silly seeing sans holding up.

1833
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,340
Oh my god, look at that.

1834
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:46,020
I'm so kawaii.

1835
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,200
Just drinking my boba tea as sans.

1836
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:54,380
Just another day for sans undertale.

1837
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,620
Alright, time to...

1838
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,220
Oh wait, can I farm them now?

1839
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,440
No, they still need to be watered.

1840
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,800
Alright, let's see.

1841
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,500
Okay, it's time to gather some resources.

1842
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,280
Let's actually get some work done, guys.

1843
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:16,740
Let's actually do the Minecraft in this Minecraft game.

1844
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,800
Oh wait, or go to the mines.

1845
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,800
My body yearns for the mines.

1846
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:21,680
Let's go.

1847
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,910
Classic sans, drinking boba.

1848
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:28,690
Is this all I have to do?

1849
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:31,550
Can I not- oh wait, whoops.

1850
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:33,910
Wait, can I not mine amethyst?

1851
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:37,730
How the fuck do I play- How the fuck do I mine in this Minecraft game?

1852
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,750
Oh, this is how you mine.

1853
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:41,310
When they start sparkling.

1854
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:43,070
Okay.

1855
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,710
Let's grab this.

1856
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:45,890
Oh, it's like stardew.

1857
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:48,690
What did I get?

1858
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:49,690
This is iron.

1859
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,750
Okay, what do I do with iron though?

1860
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:53,190
I should read the tutorial.

1861
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:56,230
There's glowing rocks.

1862
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:58,250
Yeah, I'm getting the rocks right now.

1863
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,590
You have to like...

1864
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,490
mash it.

1865
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:02,670
For it.

1866
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:04,910
Oh, this is a big boy.

1867
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,090
A big boy, a big stone.

1868
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,050
It's mining with extra steps.

1869
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:11,390
Yeah.

1870
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,190
Like, I'm like, there's gold over here.

1871
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,810
Give me the gold.

1872
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,050
Like, I don't understand.

1873
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:20,070
It's a full gold block.

1874
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,570
Why can't I have it?

1875
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,090
It's just sitting there.

1876
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:28,730
Like, I don't...

1877
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,130
Give me the gold.

1878
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:32,870
The goblin demands the gold.

1879
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:34,890
It's just taunting me.

1880
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:39,810
It's got them- Look, they have the goddamn gold all the way there.

1881
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:42,010
And I can't do anything about it.

1882
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:47,650
It's just sitting there taunting me, being like, you could have this gold, but you can't.

1883
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:50,690
And they're just taunting me now.

1884
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:53,070
Showing me the gold.

1885
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:56,350
But I can't do anything about it.

1886
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,730
Give me the gold.

1887
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:01,190
The goblin demands the gold.

1888
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,010
This is Hello Kitty.

1889
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,110
I'm sorry.

1890
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,890
Only Hello Kitty can have this gold.

1891
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:09,310
What is it?

1892
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:11,150
Are these stairs?

1893
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,850
Oh, is this like mini parkour?

1894
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:14,210
For the children?

1895
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:17,670
Like, look at this.

1896
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:18,890
Look at this.

1897
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,710
I can't believe it.

1898
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:22,150
It's just there.

1899
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:23,450
It's just sitting there.

1900
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:26,970
Why is it just sitting there?

1901
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,530
Kids at first.

1902
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:30,430
Parkour.

1903
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:33,170
All of these.

1904
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,110
It's just sitting there taunting me.

1905
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,690
Being like, you can't have this.

1906
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:39,590
It's mocking me.

1907
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:41,910
Parkour civilization.

1908
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:45,590
You're like, Hello Kitty's like, that's right.

1909
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:47,290
That's right.

1910
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:48,890
You can't have this.

1911
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:52,110
This is owned by Hello Kitty.

1912
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:55,850
Alright, I have so much rocks.

1913
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:57,510
I don't know what to do with all this rock.

1914
01:12:57,730 --> 01:12:58,670
But I have a lot.

1915
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:01,230
I guess this is for upgrades, right?

1916
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:05,390
Alright, I'm ready to head out.

1917
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:08,710
Will you jump for the boba tea You're the only Geary.

1918
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:15,330
Well, I got my resources here.

1919
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:17,270
You can put your...

1920
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:20,370
Your resources at a billboard.

1921
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:22,070
Okay, let's see.

1922
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:24,110
Let me actually read the tutorial.

1923
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:25,170
Tutorial.

1924
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,250
Resource gathering.

1925
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:30,250
Binding.

1926
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:33,090
Okay, that's not what I wanted.

1927
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,990
Where do I put my stuff?

1928
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:36,950
I don't understand.

1929
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:38,290
Oh, house upgrades.

1930
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:38,830
There you go.

1931
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,030
Upgrade board.

1932
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:42,790
Uh, appear on the board.

1933
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:45,210
You can find the upgrade board outside your house.

1934
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:45,790
Oh, okay.

1935
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,530
Outside my house.

1936
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:49,650
Is it that?

1937
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:50,910
That has to be it.

1938
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:53,970
That's my board right there.

1939
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,060
Hello?

1940
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:00,760
Take my stone.

1941
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:03,560
That's...

1942
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,600
Take my stone.

1943
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,260
Take...

1944
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,240
Take it!

1945
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:10,920
That's the board!

1946
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,380
Your need to complete will also appear on the board.

1947
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:19,100
Just interact with the materials on the board to deposit them.

1948
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:20,540
Take it.

1949
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:21,820
Take it.

1950
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:22,880
Take the stone!

1951
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,440
Take the stone!

1952
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,500
Oh my god.

1953
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,700
Oh my god, why won't it take my stone?

1954
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:30,640
Oh!

1955
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,660
Is it this?

1956
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,460
What the fuck is this?

1957
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,540
Oh, I need a blueprint?

1958
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,700
Okay, clearly I didn't read all my rules then.

1959
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,120
Alright, tutorial.

1960
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,900
House upgrade.

1961
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:50,880
Blueprints.

1962
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,420
These will allow you to...

1963
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,000
Oh, okay.

1964
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,280
That makes more sense now.

1965
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,220
Okay, I doesn't understand.

1966
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,680
Doki doesn't understand children games.

1967
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,180
Woah, this is creepy.

1968
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,660
What's over here?

1969
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,160
Oh, it's like a little shortcut!

1970
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,000
I see you.

1971
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:10,820
I built this.

1972
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:17,400
I see you.

1973
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,260
Doki.

1974
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,300
I see you, Sanrio Town.

1975
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,460
I built this.

1976
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,680
Just so I can get here faster.

1977
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,700
A secret tunnel into their homes.

1978
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,180
She stalks from the shadows.

1979
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,780
I wonder if I can buy blueprints at Hello Kitty's place.

1980
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,720
Alright, Hello Kitty.

1981
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,120
I need to know, do you have blueprints for me?

1982
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,300
Someone stop this.

1983
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:52,900
Stop me.

1984
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,500
What do you mean it's not creepy?

1985
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,140
How is it creepy?

1986
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,680
I just love them so much.

1987
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,840
Basic white paint.

1988
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,360
Where's house upgrades?

1989
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,080
Is it this?

1990
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,860
I still can't afford it.

1991
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,780
I'm not rich enough.

1992
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:16,440
I'm not rich enough.

1993
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,620
Alright, let's go back then.

1994
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,200
No gems.

1995
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,340
No gems.

1996
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:29,440
I did not corner any residents in their homes.

1997
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,820
Stop spreading these fake news and fake propaganda, guys.

1998
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,700
I did not corner anybody.

1999
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:43,180
They invited me to their homes and I just happened to be in the corner, guys.

2000
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:49,680
Stop spreading this fake propaganda and like slandering me or you're gonna be talking to my lawyer.

2001
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,940
They were already in the corner.

2002
01:16:56,020 --> 01:17:00,180
How would I corner anybody if they were already in the corner, guys?

2003
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,900
They were already there.

2004
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,080
I just happened to walk over there.

2005
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,780
Okay, and then I got the logs.

2006
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,520
Log time.

2007
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,720
Streamer reflects the viewer.

2008
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:17,080
Alright, let me deforest this forest real quick.

2009
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,460
This miniature forest.

2010
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,620
I'm so sad I can't cut the big trees.

2011
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,100
It's just there standing there.

2012
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,000
It's literally just there standing there waiting for me to cut.

2013
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,720
Waiting for me to be like chop chop.

2014
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,520
How do I find wheels?

2015
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,220
I need wheels and I'm like how?

2016
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,920
I guess like the market would have wheels?

2017
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:37,780
Okay.

2018
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,480
I don't understand.

2019
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,060
It's better if I can just chop the fresher trees.

2020
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,620
Fresh trees equals better wood.

2021
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:48,280
Why do I have to chop dead trees?

2022
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,180
Give me the fresh trees.

2023
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,220
I yearn for the fresh trees.

2024
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,500
Let me cut the fresh trees.

2025
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:58,500
I wanna explore this.

2026
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,640
Oh wait, that's back home.

2027
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,040
Okay, I'm gonna eat my onigiri real quick.

2028
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,520
So I just gotta eat the onigiri and then drink some boba tea.

2029
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,260
Alright, I could fish a little bit.

2030
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:16,140
Maybe I can grab some stuff I can sell at the market.

2031
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,980
I wanna have enough so I can have a cow!

2032
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:24,050
Where are the fishies?

2033
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:25,970
Did I over...

2034
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,390
Did I overfish already?

2035
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:29,690
Where are the fishies?

2036
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,730
Where are my fishies?

2037
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:34,110
Oh no.

2038
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:35,670
Did I...

2039
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:38,310
Did I already fished all the fishies in this lake?

2040
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:39,190
Oh no, there it is.

2041
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:42,390
Oh my god, get money.

2042
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:43,850
Wait, how much money is that?

2043
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:45,190
Surprise token?

2044
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,150
How the fuck do I use a surprise token?

2045
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,060
Oh my god, it keeps giving me a tin can.

2046
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,520
I've never had a fish yet.

2047
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,420
I've never fished an actual fish.

2048
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,140
Oh wait, I got...

2049
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,100
I got an empty bottle!

2050
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,180
For the milk!

2051
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:07,800
For the milk for the cows!

2052
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:11,120
Okay, that's alright.

2053
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:12,740
Come on.

2054
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:13,960
Come on.

2055
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:15,280
Give me my fishies.

2056
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,800
Come on.

2057
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,600
One fish, that's all I want.

2058
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,580
Just one fish.

2059
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:23,180
Oh my god, this lake is so polluted.

2060
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,360
There is...

2061
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,500
There is something wrong with this town.

2062
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,400
Why is it all just...

2063
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,600
Why is it all just fucking trash?

2064
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:37,580
Hello Kitty is hiding something in Sanrio Town.

2065
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,220
Hello Kitty is hiding something.

2066
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,860
Why every time my fish is just trash?

2067
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,740
It's not the perfect town they all want you to think it is.

2068
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,180
The lake is only a waste of...

2069
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:49,080
This pose.

2070
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,200
She's hiding something and I'm gonna...

2071
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,380
I'm gonna discover it.

2072
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,820
Alright, let's see.

2073
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,660
Oh shit, hey.

2074
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,180
Why are you freaking out again?

2075
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:04,980
Oh, what do I do?

2076
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,020
Oh, you have to help me.

2077
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:06,960
Mistakes were made.

2078
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:07,880
They were there and then they weren't.

2079
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,800
Oh wait, it's the same mission.

2080
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,000
It's the same one.

2081
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,720
Okay, uh...

2082
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,060
What is this token for?

2083
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,360
Is it for this?

2084
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:19,560
Oh!

2085
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:21,800
It's a gachapon.

2086
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:22,900
What did I get?

2087
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,840
I got a kitchen!

2088
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,560
I can finally wash my hands!

2089
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,320
Alright, I need to sell my junk real quick.

2090
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,080
Let me sell my junk.

2091
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,260
Alright, Hello Kitty, I got some junk for you.

2092
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:38,460
Uh...

2093
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,340
Okay, I got the tin can.

2094
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,660
And I'll just...

2095
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,480
There you go.

2096
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:47,580
Nice, one dollar.

2097
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:48,680
Nice.

2098
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,400
Uh...

2099
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,840
What else can I sell?

2100
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,340
I need like blueprints, but I don't know how to get blueprints.

2101
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:59,640
They never told me how to get blueprints!

2102
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,600
They're just like, welcome to this new world.

2103
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:03,820
Be free.

2104
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,680
I'm like, what?

2105
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:10,340
How the fuck am I supposed to figure out what blueprints?

2106
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,560
Where do I upgrade?

2107
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:12,480
Oh my god.

2108
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,400
Please sell this.

2109
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:22,060
I'm just gonna... I might as well sell my resources cause like, I don't know what else to do with it.

2110
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,920
They're just like, welcome to this world.

2111
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,180
Now just do, I don't know, just survive.

2112
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,340
Like, I'm like, what do I do with all my...

2113
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:37,380
I'm just gonna sell this.

2114
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,740
I don't need any of this yet.

2115
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:40,580
I want my bees.

2116
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:43,560
Take it.

2117
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,740
I want my bees.

2118
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,180
Okay.

2119
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:48,860
And then...

2120
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,260
Pew!

2121
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:53,100
Get it in.

2122
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,000
Get this in.

2123
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,080
Alright.

2124
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,260
Do I have everything?

2125
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,320
Oh, I can sell iron.

2126
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,480
How much does iron give me?

2127
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,020
That's fine.

2128
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,120
Oh my god, can I afford bees now?

2129
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:09,380
Can I afford bees?

2130
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,420
Yay!

2131
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:15,540
Bees.

2132
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:17,660
Yeah!

2133
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:21,080
Oh my god, guys.

2134
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:22,340
I got bees.

2135
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,100
With no bees in it though.

2136
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:24,900
I don't have bees.

2137
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:31,560
I'm gonna toil in the mine so I can buy bees for my bees.

2138
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,780
I got a bee hive!

2139
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:35,940
Let's go!

2140
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,420
I can finally go home!

2141
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,920
Bees but no bees.

2142
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:43,620
It's okay.

2143
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,980
We're getting there!

2144
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,920
The bees without the bee.

2145
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,460
Wait, how do I...

2146
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,080
Where's my cave that I dug?

2147
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,360
I dug a cave right here somewhere.

2148
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:55,880
Oh, I forgot.

2149
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,480
Where's my transportation cave?

2150
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,120
Oh, it's right here.

2151
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:00,660
There you go.

2152
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,120
My little shortcut that I dug.

2153
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,640
I can see you, Sanrio Town.

2154
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,540
I'm sorry.

2155
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,000
I should stop.

2156
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:08,960
I should stop.

2157
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,620
Where do I put this?

2158
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,900
Wait, it says bee upgrade.

2159
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,800
Do I even have a...

2160
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,300
Wait a minute.

2161
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,180
Wait a minute.

2162
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,740
How do I...

2163
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,340
Do I even have...

2164
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:30,940
Do I even have a bee house?

2165
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,160
Wait.

2166
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,460
I bought this for no reason.

2167
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,960
Where's my bee house?

2168
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,620
How do I...

2169
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:42,060
How does one use the bees?

2170
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
I don't...

2171
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,640
How do I use the bees?

2172
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,920
Did you get scammed?

2173
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:52,560
They're...

2174
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,960
Live, farm, love.

2175
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,900
But like, how do I use this?

2176
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,000
Wait a minute.

2177
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,200
The bee field is opposite to my house?

2178
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,940
Oh my God, where the fuck is that bee hide?

2179
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:11,660
What was the point?

2180
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,480
Oh no, I'm getting tired.

2181
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:14,860
Wait.

2182
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:16,240
I'm trying to...

2183
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:16,960
Guys, please.

2184
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,280
I'm trying to figure out...

2185
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,240
Oh, it's right here.

2186
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,400
Oh my God, I did it.

2187
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,600
It's right here.

2188
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:23,620
Okay, there you go.

2189
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:24,840
I got this.

2190
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:31,200
And then tomorrow, I live in the mines so I can buy bees.

2191
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,240
Oh my God, for the first time, I'm not gonna pass out.

2192
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:37,560
Where's my bed?

2193
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:39,460
Sleep.

2194
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:46,530
For the first time in my Hello Kitty adventure, I actually will not pass out.

2195
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:52,300
Oh my God, I did it.

2196
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:53,160
Day four.

2197
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:56,580
Apparently, in day eight is where, like, things get crazy.

2198
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,920
Oh shit, okay, let me get rid of the pachaco.

2199
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:03,840
If I... I can farm less if I can sell my pachaco balls.

2200
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,960
I can't... I can't believe I accidentally bought those balls.

2201
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:07,820
I didn't know what they were.

2202
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:08,260
I was like, what?

2203
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:13,700
I didn't know you right-click it and then you literally bought it by... Oh wait, can I farm this?

2204
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,880
Oh my God, I can farm lettuce now.

2205
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,240
Oh my God, finally.

2206
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:19,840
Finally.

2207
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:23,220
Okay, and then, back to the mines I go.

2208
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,460
Back to the mines I go.

2209
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,720
Hello Kitty owns me.

2210
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,860
She forces me to go into the mines.

2211
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:37,960
Taunting me with her fucking gold.

2212
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,880
Alright, back to the mines I go.

2213
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,060
So I can buy bees.

2214
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,250
The things I do for bees.

2215
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:54,340
I yearn for the mines.

2216
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,100
So I can have bees.

2217
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:02,060
And then when I get the bees, I can have...

2218
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:05,020
I'll be able to have cows!

2219
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,740
Okay, cows are endgame.

2220
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,440
We don't stop until I get the cows.

2221
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,540
The bees, no.

2222
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,440
For the bees.

2223
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:18,860
I feel like... No, this is worse than being in debt to Tom Nook.

2224
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,280
This is a lot worse.

2225
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:26,940
At least Tom Nook doesn't force me to go into the mines and then show me the gold that I cannot touch.

2226
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,160
That's... This is honestly much more worse.

2227
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,340
I need the milk.

2228
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:38,020
I just need the milk.

2229
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,120
Please.

2230
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,660
I yearn for the milk just like Homelander.

2231
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,860
This economy fucking sucks.

2232
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,040
Into the mines.

2233
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,400
Oh, am I like running out?

2234
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:56,600
There's like so little I should actually save up for the iron though.

2235
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,380
Whoa.

2236
01:26:58,860 --> 01:26:59,820
But not like that though.

2237
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,240
But not exactly like that.

2238
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,740
It's so weird that you have parkour here.

2239
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:08,960
Like it's like baby's first parkour.

2240
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:13,310
Oh my god.

2241
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:16,610
Is she gonna get top 500 in this game?

2242
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,210
Please!

2243
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:22,210
Let me have my bees and cows!

2244
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:25,610
It's like a thousand dollars for a fucking cow too.

2245
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:29,930
Like...

2246
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:30,610
If...

2247
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:34,490
Okay, if Hello Kitty is so nice, why don't she just give it to me for free?

2248
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,250
She's already a billionaire.

2249
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:39,730
Like, why does she want more money than me, huh?

2250
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:41,910
Why does she want more money from me, huh?

2251
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:43,190
If she's so rich.

2252
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:45,090
Look, she owns Sanrio Town.

2253
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:48,450
She literally owns the only market in this town.

2254
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:52,910
Everything goes towards Hello Kitty.

2255
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:59,010
None of the other residents have like... have any way of earning money.

2256
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:05,050
Hello Kitty doesn't give handouts.

2257
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:06,730
Oh fuck.

2258
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,330
Oh fuck.

2259
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:13,470
She's rich for a reason, Doki.

2260
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:19,090
Yeah, but like I could be a tax write-off.

2261
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:20,430
I don't understand!

2262
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:23,990
I could be a good tax write-off for her.

2263
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:27,390
You know, when people do charity stuff, it's to help for taxes.

2264
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:30,630
Like, I could be that guy.

2265
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:33,010
Explains how...

2266
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:35,850
Her house is so much bigger than all the other residents, not gonna lie.

2267
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:37,550
And she has a garden.

2268
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:40,850
None of the other residents has a garden like her.

2269
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:45,510
Using it as a tax write-off is wild.

2270
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:47,790
You know, that's why a lot of people do charities.

2271
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:50,290
Charity stuff for like the rich people.

2272
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:54,970
Like, you can be like, oh, I have like my own like charity what is it called?

2273
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:58,570
Like this charity foundation and stuff like that.

2274
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:01,730
Or like, a lot of them just do it for tax write-offs.

2275
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:07,230
I could be your tax write-off, Hello Kitty!

2276
01:29:08,230 --> 01:29:09,250
It could be me!

2277
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,390
Okay, I'm just gonna go in here, have some fucking rocks.

2278
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:17,310
Okay, I should be able to afford a bee, right?

2279
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:19,350
Bye.

2280
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:21,690
Can I get to buy some bees?

2281
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:24,090
Oh my god, I can buy one queen bee!

2282
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:26,030
Yes, alright.

2283
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:29,210
Soon, I will be rich enough for a cow.

2284
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,750
Alright guys, we're saving up for a cow.

2285
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:33,070
What the fuck is that?

2286
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,190
Is that a pig?

2287
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:37,270
Why is a pig more expensive than a cow?

2288
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:38,690
What am I gonna do with a pig?

2289
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:39,270
Eat it?

2290
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:41,350
Oh, I guess that is what I'm gonna do with a pig.

2291
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:44,610
I see bees in mine's doughkeeper too.

2292
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:49,390
I see them zoom for me and for you, and I think to myself, what is wrong with this world?

2293
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:52,310
Upside down, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

2294
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:54,150
That's a chunky ass pig, yeah.

2295
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:56,550
This bacon economy.

2296
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:58,010
Oh, for the truffles?

2297
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:59,390
There's truffles in this world?

2298
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,370
It's okay guys, I got the queen bee.

2299
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:10,370
I'm gonna save up the iron, so like I don't have to worry, cause I feel like iron's gonna be super important for upgrading.

2300
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:11,590
Alright.

2301
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:11,890
What?

2302
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:16,710
Hello Kitty does not believe in welfare.

2303
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:22,350
Hello Kitty uses scabs when workers are on strike.

2304
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:27,330
Why do you think there's no- Why do you think she's working in the market herself?

2305
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:28,730
She trusts no one.

2306
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:32,730
She doesn't hire employees.

2307
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:34,410
That's a waste of her money.

2308
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:36,670
Alright, let's get some wood real quick too.

2309
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:37,970
Since we're here.

2310
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:41,710
I don't even think I like- How do I get back my HP?

2311
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:45,710
Am I forever gonna- What happens when I die in Hello Kitty Town?

2312
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:48,970
Do I die in- In real life?

2313
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:51,590
Does Hello Kitty own me?

2314
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:53,950
Can I even die in Hello Kitty World?

2315
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:57,430
Alright, let me cut some trees.

2316
01:30:57,590 --> 01:31:05,870
Put the queen bee out in the- Put the queen bee in her bee keeping house and then like die.

2317
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:07,910
I'm curious.

2318
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:12,170
I'm actually- I'm actually curious what happens if I die in Hello Kitty World.

2319
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:14,950
I'm gonna do it.

2320
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:17,590
She has pushed me too far, guys.

2321
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:19,410
She has pushed me too far.

2322
01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:19,970
It's time.

2323
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:23,070
Time to test that theory.

2324
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:28,250
Hello Kitty.

2325
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:30,290
You have done too much!

2326
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:36,570
Your reign in Hello Kitty Land ends here.

2327
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:43,450
My death will cause a rebellion for the people of Sanrio.

2328
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:47,990
You literally worked for two days.

2329
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:49,550
Two days too many.

2330
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:54,630
I can't believe I worked for two days and I still don't have my cows.

2331
01:31:57,710 --> 01:31:59,910
I will start the revolution.

2332
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:02,110
Alright, queen bee.

2333
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:03,050
Yay!

2334
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:08,550
How do I get honey?

2335
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:14,610
Okay, but now, how do I get the honey though?

2336
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:17,490
Oh, gems.

2337
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:21,950
Oh, I have to look in the tutorial to see the gems?

2338
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:24,990
What the fuck kind of bullshit is that?

2339
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:26,050
Alright.

2340
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:28,810
Apiculture.

2341
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:29,430
Okay.

2342
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:33,910
You can paint your hive using- you can find many different colors.

2343
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:36,730
Hives can be harvested every seven days in spring.

2344
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:42,470
Once your hives have a queen in them, when you see honey dripping, it is time to collect it.

2345
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:45,730
Honey, use it on the hive to calm down the bees.

2346
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:46,850
Empty jar.

2347
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,670
Oh, I have to grab a smoker?

2348
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:52,630
And like, why can't I- Oh my god, what are you gonna do?

2349
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:54,330
Sting me in a death fucking final.

2350
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:57,550
Then I shall be free.

2351
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:59,270
Okay, let me put my items away, guys.

2352
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:02,490
Let me put my items away.

2353
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:04,390
I didn't know I had to look at the goddamn tutorial?

2354
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:08,310
To like, figure out how much money I have?

2355
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:11,350
Oh, I forgot to put this away.

2356
01:33:11,490 --> 01:33:12,170
Alright, hold on.

2357
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:15,430
Put these away.

2358
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:17,710
Okay, it's time.

2359
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:20,670
It's time.

2360
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:24,450
I know the perfect place to make a statement.

2361
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:36,270
I know a perfect place to make a statement to Hello Kitty and her reign of terror.

2362
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:37,890
And her reign of terror.

2363
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:41,890
To the mines I go.

2364
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,490
To the mines I go.

2365
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:49,010
Alright.

2366
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:53,470
I will not be ignored or silenced.

2367
01:33:55,290 --> 01:34:00,090
I shall- Oh my god, okay, first off, let me like, figure out how to parkour again.

2368
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:04,590
Let me- Oh my god.

2369
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:08,350
I shall make a statement to the world of Hello Kitty land.

2370
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:11,930
She cannot control us.

2371
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:15,190
She cannot control us!

2372
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:17,350
Oh, wait.

2373
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:17,770
Whoops.

2374
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:19,830
Alright, this is it.

2375
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:21,350
This has to be the final jump.

2376
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:24,930
I thought landing on the spike would end it faster, but apparently not.

2377
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:29,960
For the beast!

2378
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,780
Jokey fell from a high.

2379
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:35,500
You died.

2380
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,540
Oh, I just come back to life.

2381
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:38,520
Okay, I need to get my stuff.

2382
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,800
You cannot leave.

2383
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:46,200
You're here forever.

2384
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,400
Hello Kitty owns you now.

2385
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:53,560
You must be like, how the fuck does she die in a Hello Kitty DLC?

2386
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:55,000
I cannot.

2387
01:34:58,540 --> 01:34:59,960
I guess I go back.

2388
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,780
There is no escape from Hello Kitty world.

2389
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:07,280
There's my work equipment.

2390
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,100
There's my work equipment.

2391
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:13,300
Back to work I go, I guess.

2392
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,920
Back to the mines I go.

2393
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,380
You're here forever.

2394
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,920
Why'd you stop mining?

2395
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:27,140
Jokey.

2396
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:29,960
Hello Kitty requires more stone.

2397
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,860
Why'd you stop mining?

2398
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:39,480
No one lives in Hello Kitty land.

2399
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:45,360
Hello Kitty monopolizes all.

2400
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,540
Now I'm a Sanrio character.

2401
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,360
Wasn't that a nice break?

2402
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:54,440
Your watering can?

2403
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:55,060
It's alright.

2404
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,720
I have another watering can at home anyway.

2405
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:02,900
Thank you my Hello Kitty overlords for my watering can.

2406
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,400
Thank you.

2407
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,700
Thank you for the water.

2408
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:11,280
Oh, you lost your watering can?

2409
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,080
Don't worry.

2410
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:13,760
Don't worry.

2411
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:15,100
That's what we're here for.

2412
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,420
So you can have more.

2413
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:17,140
Okay.

2414
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,380
I guess I can sell my wood.

2415
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:21,280
Wait, actually.

2416
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:23,200
Dying in Hello Kitty land.

2417
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,820
Dying is so much more efficient.

2418
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:28,000
If I die, I don't have to eat.

2419
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,500
I can just respawn.

2420
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,360
Wait, it's just so much more.

2421
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,380
Why the fuck would I eat if I can just die?

2422
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,680
That's crazy.

2423
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,500
I just have to go to the mines every time I'm hungry.

2424
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:44,800
It's just that easy.

2425
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:49,000
Gamers never dies.

2426
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,480
That's a wild thing.

2427
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:52,320
What?

2428
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,460
It's true.

2429
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:59,580
I just have to like, if I'm ever hungry, I just go in the mines.

2430
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:03,200
Maxing in Hello Kitty world.

2431
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,120
All I'm saying is that there's no point in eating at this point.

2432
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:08,020
Alright.

2433
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,120
So, I have some rock for you, my queen.

2434
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,520
And also some wood.

2435
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,620
And some more wood.

2436
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,340
And also, like, lettuce.

2437
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,620
Oh my god!

2438
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,120
Wait, lettuce is money?!

2439
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,420
And also this.

2440
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,700
Wait, how much is this?

2441
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:31,800
Oh, that's $200.

2442
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,080
Wait, oh my god.

2443
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,780
Wait, why the fuck am I selling you stone?

2444
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,720
Okay, let me buy some.

2445
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:37,900
Let me buy some lettuce.

2446
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:38,120
Lettuce.

2447
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:41,240
What is this?

2448
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:42,200
Fertilizer.

2449
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:44,540
Lettuce seed.

2450
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:45,240
Okay, lettuce.

2451
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:48,980
Alright, maybe I should get some eggplants too for the memes.

2452
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,140
And then, some corn.

2453
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,720
Oh, I bought two lettuce.

2454
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:57,060
Whoops.

2455
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,660
Oh my god, more lettuce for everybody.

2456
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:05,880
Wait, I have so much money, I can buy sheep, cow, pig, chicken.

2457
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,460
Wait, I should buy chicken.

2458
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,140
I might as well.

2459
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:10,380
I'll buy chicken.

2460
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,860
Okay, and then I can lock chicken!

2461
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:17,340
Oh my god, I'm gonna buy... Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2462
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:21,200
Okay, smoker, shears, empty jar, empty bottle, ammo.

2463
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:23,740
I'm gonna buy...

2464
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,280
I'm gonna... Wait, chicken locked?

2465
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:28,020
Oh, I need more.

2466
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,740
I need... Okay, how much money do I have?

2467
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,180
Tutorial.

2468
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:31,960
How much money do I have?

2469
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:32,380
Tutorial.

2470
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:34,120
I have a thousand dollars left.

2471
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:36,300
Oh, do I want...

2472
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:38,140
Should I get sheep?

2473
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:39,200
I might as well.

2474
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:40,500
Fuck it, I'm gonna buy sheep too.

2475
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,000
We're almost there at endgame anyway.

2476
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:46,200
Okay, and then... Oh, I don't have shears.

2477
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,720
It's alright, I don't need shears yet.

2478
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:48,720
Alright.

2479
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:54,400
I don't need smoker.

2480
01:38:54,560 --> 01:39:00,460
The bees... I just don't... I need five days to fucking make enough for it.

2481
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,220
And that's enough rock.

2482
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:03,660
I can farm more rock.

2483
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,060
I have my sheep.

2484
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:07,980
And my chicken.

2485
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:10,120
And I can farm chicken eggs!

2486
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:13,480
Chicken eggs must be like super expensive anyway, right?

2487
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:17,720
It's time.

2488
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:20,240
Where's the cave that I made?

2489
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:21,780
My secret tunnel.

2490
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:23,400
Goodbye.

2491
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:24,960
Goodbye, Sanrio Land.

2492
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,240
Goodbye.

2493
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:37,320
Alright.

2494
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:38,920
Where's my...

2495
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,160
Where's my chicken house?

2496
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,280
Wait, where is it?

2497
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,280
Where will my chickens be?

2498
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:44,800
Let's see.

2499
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:46,080
Okay, no.

2500
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:49,080
Wait, where will my chickens be though?

2501
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:52,000
It never told me where it is.

2502
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,600
Where does my chicken live?

2503
01:39:57,380 --> 01:39:59,160
I'll be back tomorrow.

2504
01:39:59,160 --> 01:39:59,420
There we go.

2505
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:05,140
I'm tired.

2506
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:10,820
I'll look at the chicken tomorrow when I wake up.

2507
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:15,000
Wait,

2508
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:19,380
how is that creepy?

2509
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,340
I'm just saying goodbye.

2510
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:23,540
How is that creepy?

2511
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:29,680
Oh, just cause I wanted to say goodbye to my friends.

2512
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,300
I'm a creep.

2513
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:37,920
Alright, are they in here?

2514
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:39,580
Is this where my chicken lives?

2515
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,700
Oh, there they are!

2516
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:44,920
I got chicken!

2517
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:48,040
Oh my god, my sheep's naked!

2518
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,780
Wait, how do I...

2519
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,720
How do I gather my resources?

2520
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:55,980
Okay, it's time to...

2521
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:59,120
Oh my god, wait, there's an eye of ender in my fucking...

2522
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:01,680
Alright, it's time to read.

2523
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:02,740
Okay.

2524
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:04,420
Tutorial.

2525
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,100
Wait, no, not that one.

2526
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,180
Back to tutorial.

2527
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:08,260
Animal husbandry.

2528
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:09,440
Farm animals.

2529
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,680
You'll need to feed your animals everyday.

2530
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:12,960
Animal feed can be bought.

2531
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,340
Use empty bottles to collect.

2532
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,880
Use shears to collect wood.

2533
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:17,740
Chickens produce...

2534
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:22,080
Okay, so I just need to give them animal feed and then they'll be fine.

2535
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:25,000
Okay, I need to go back to... Wait, how much gems do I have?

2536
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:26,280
Tablet.

2537
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,000
Gems.

2538
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:28,320
162.

2539
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:29,680
Okay, that should be enough.

2540
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,300
See, it hasn't produced a honey yet.

2541
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:33,020
There's no yellow.

2542
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,860
Okay, then I'm gonna go get some rocks then.

2543
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:38,460
Okay, here we go.

2544
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,460
Okay, boop.

2545
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:43,400
Boop.

2546
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,520
Oh, I can farm this now.

2547
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:46,200
Nice.

2548
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,680
Alright, I should have enough.

2549
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,330
I need to feed my fucking sheep and my...

2550
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:57,390
There's no way to like make it make animal feed too.

2551
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:58,710
So Hello Kitty just...

2552
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:02,190
Goddamn capitalistic bitch.

2553
01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:07,910
This is why Cinnamoroll is my Kamiyoshi.

2554
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:15,770
This is why Cinnamoroll is my Kamiyoshi.

2555
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:19,110
I can't even make my own animal feed.

2556
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:20,250
I gotta buy from her.

2557
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:22,330
I gotta... She owns everything.

2558
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:23,470
She owns the entire town.

2559
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:24,170
She owns...

2560
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:25,650
She owns the people.

2561
01:42:25,970 --> 01:42:27,310
She owns everybody.

2562
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:32,650
I can't even... I don't even have a scooter because I need to buy wheels from Hello Kitty.

2563
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:34,630
I need to buy paint from Hello Kitty.

2564
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:35,610
I need to buy wheels.

2565
01:42:35,850 --> 01:42:37,030
Where are the wheels, Hello Kitty?

2566
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:38,790
Where can I obtain the wheels?

2567
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:41,890
She owns me.

2568
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:44,310
All I can do is just dig.

2569
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:47,830
All I can do is just mine in this town.

2570
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:49,990
That's my entire existence.

2571
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:51,630
Just mine, doggy.

2572
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:52,750
Just mine.

2573
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:55,250
Our corporate overlord wants more rock.

2574
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:57,070
I can't even upgrade my farm.

2575
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:59,890
All I can do is just sell the rock back to her.

2576
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:03,450
That's the difference of...

2577
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:05,550
Alright.

2578
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,350
It's fine.

2579
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:09,190
And now I'm tired.

2580
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:11,450
Now I'm hungry.

2581
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:13,510
Is this what you want, Hello Kitty?

2582
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:14,930
I'm hungry now.

2583
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:15,850
I'm hungry.

2584
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:17,330
I can't even...

2585
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:19,350
The only food I have is in my chest.

2586
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:22,210
What happens when I eat all my food in the chest?

2587
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:28,490
Intentional servitude with Hello Kitty.

2588
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:31,670
More mining, less complaining.

2589
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:35,590
What do I do when I run out of food, Hello Kitty?

2590
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:38,850
Do you want me to just jump off in the mines?

2591
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,150
Alright.

2592
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:44,950
I need to go back to my house to...

2593
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:48,430
Eat, guys.

2594
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:50,070
Guess I'll die.

2595
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:53,810
Alright.

2596
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:54,430
Let's see.

2597
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:58,210
They don't even refill my food.

2598
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:00,190
I think that's the most messed up part.

2599
01:44:00,850 --> 01:44:03,530
I eat and eat, but they don't even refill it.

2600
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:08,210
Like...

2601
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:09,370
Every day...

2602
01:44:10,130 --> 01:44:12,030
You have energy to complain.

2603
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:15,690
You have energy to eat up my...

2604
01:44:15,690 --> 01:44:17,710
That's wild.

2605
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:19,510
That's freaking wild.

2606
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:22,090
Alright, back into my dungeon.

2607
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:26,010
If I want real creepy, I can be like this, guys.

2608
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:27,190
This is real creepy.

2609
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:29,130
This is the real creep factor.

2610
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:33,940
Wait.

2611
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:36,520
Hello, Hello Kitty.

2612
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:37,700
I'm back.

2613
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,180
Hello.

2614
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:48,180
Alright.

2615
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:49,260
Let's see.

2616
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,340
I gotta sell...

2617
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:54,300
I gotta sell my...

2618
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:55,620
Lettuce.

2619
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,160
And...

2620
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:00,840
And my rocks.

2621
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:02,980
My five lettuce and rocks.

2622
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:05,580
I guess I could buy more lettuce.

2623
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:08,520
Lettuce is really fast to grow.

2624
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:13,200
It'd be creepy if you weren't Sans Undertale.

2625
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,480
I'm literally a skeleton.

2626
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:17,260
How much more creepy can it get?

2627
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:19,220
Alright.

2628
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:21,840
So...

2629
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:22,660
Um...

2630
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:24,640
Take my rocks, my lettuce.

2631
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:27,260
Yeah, I wanna keep the iron.

2632
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:30,760
And...

2633
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:33,120
Okay, that's 350.

2634
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:35,680
And then that is...

2635
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,180
Because one rock is like $1.

2636
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,740
Okay, 414.

2637
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:39,320
Alright.

2638
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:41,040
I need animal feed.

2639
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,500
Hello Kitty, because you own me anyway.

2640
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:46,820
There you go.

2641
01:45:50,890 --> 01:45:51,470
There we go.

2642
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:52,550
Two animal feed.

2643
01:45:53,230 --> 01:45:55,010
And then I don't need shears yet.

2644
01:45:55,090 --> 01:45:55,850
Because I feel like...

2645
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:58,370
Let's just buy shears for now.

2646
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:00,790
And then...

2647
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:01,710
Let's just buy more lettuce.

2648
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:06,070
Alright, there we go.

2649
01:46:08,610 --> 01:46:09,850
Oh, I bought pumpkin.

2650
01:46:09,850 --> 01:46:11,750
I bought pumpkin!

2651
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:13,750
Okay.

2652
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:17,890
I didn't mean to buy pumpkin seeds.

2653
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:20,390
I can't even grow them.

2654
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:23,330
I can't even grow my pumpkin.

2655
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,230
I was like, what?

2656
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:26,170
How did I select a pumpkin?

2657
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:32,450
Grow me, can you make me happy?

2658
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:36,170
Bitch, I don't even fucking care anymore.

2659
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:46,590
I asked you to make me happy and you talk about Hello Kitty to my face?

2660
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:48,210
How could you?

2661
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:50,670
You know that's my trigger warning.

2662
01:46:51,170 --> 01:46:53,590
You know that's a trigger!

2663
01:46:55,970 --> 01:47:00,070
They're all working on their big kitty.

2664
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:02,610
They're all working for her.

2665
01:47:02,930 --> 01:47:04,650
On their big kitty.

2666
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:06,050
Oh, not tolerant.

2667
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:07,990
I can't even grow pumpkin.

2668
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:09,810
What do you want from me?

2669
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:12,530
I can't even grow it.

2670
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:18,430
Okay, this, this.

2671
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:20,030
Oh shit.

2672
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:22,430
Fuck, I wasted the pumpkin.

2673
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:25,770
And then I wasted the pumpkin seed.

2674
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:27,030
It's not gonna grow anyway.

2675
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:28,130
I wasted it.

2676
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:30,270
I wasted the pumpkin seed.

2677
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:32,170
My pumpkin's just gonna die.

2678
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:34,710
I grew it just for it to die.

2679
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:40,810
Alright, eat.

2680
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:43,530
Eat.

2681
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:47,230
Will it just grow?

2682
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:50,350
I have to feed it by hand?

2683
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:51,730
Are you serious?

2684
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:54,850
Is that it?

2685
01:47:56,930 --> 01:48:00,270
It looks like a dog when he's naked.

2686
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:03,410
It actually looks like a dog.

2687
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:08,050
Oh my god.

2688
01:48:08,170 --> 01:48:09,090
Oh my god, this is gonna take forever.

2689
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,650
Guys, I just want a cow.

2690
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:12,550
That's all I want.

2691
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:14,570
I just want to buy a cow and then look at him.

2692
01:48:14,670 --> 01:48:15,690
And then I'm free.

2693
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:19,250
I don't even need to do anything else.

2694
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:20,550
Just give me the cow.

2695
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:24,350
Just give me the cow.

2696
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:25,830
That's all I want.

2697
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:28,550
The big corporal man.

2698
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:29,270
The big kitty.

2699
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:34,250
Alright, if I sleep, then I go to the next day.

2700
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:36,790
And then maybe I'll...

2701
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:37,990
Today is spring 5.

2702
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:39,070
We're almost there.

2703
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:42,510
I yearn for the cow.

2704
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:44,250
That's all I want.

2705
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:45,750
Cow is my endgame.

2706
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:46,450
Please.

2707
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:49,150
All I want is a cow.

2708
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:51,670
Oh my god.

2709
01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:52,770
When did I wear glasses?

2710
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:56,710
Wait, wait.

2711
01:48:57,110 --> 01:48:57,610
Oh, no.

2712
01:48:57,650 --> 01:48:59,050
I accidentally wore it.

2713
01:48:59,050 --> 01:49:00,530
Oh my god, what happened?

2714
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:02,030
How did I get my glasses on?

2715
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:04,790
Sorry, I'm a little...

2716
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:06,450
I'm hungover now from...

2717
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,610
From big kitty.

2718
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:11,130
Not the sad...

2719
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:13,050
Not the sad...

2720
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:16,830
Not the sad...

2721
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:17,230
Not the sad...

2722
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:18,750
Not the sad...

2723
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:23,050
Not the sad...

2724
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:26,250
When I get the cow, it's over.

2725
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:26,870
Okay.

2726
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:30,850
Cow is drawn.

2727
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:32,830
It doesn't even have anything.

2728
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:33,970
Oh my god, the egg!

2729
01:49:36,330 --> 01:49:37,570
Wait, I saw it.

2730
01:49:39,010 --> 01:49:39,890
Oh my god, I got an egg.

2731
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:41,310
Guys, I got an egg.

2732
01:49:42,210 --> 01:49:42,610
Oh my god.

2733
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:44,170
Make sure I don't accidentally eat the egg.

2734
01:49:44,610 --> 01:49:45,870
Oh my god, my one egg.

2735
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:48,330
I'm gonna sell you, my child.

2736
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:50,190
I'm gonna put you in the market.

2737
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:54,570
I'm gonna grow up.

2738
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:56,330
No.

2739
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:59,030
My dead pumpkin.

2740
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:04,990
My dead pumpkin.

2741
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:06,490
I'll just keep it there.

2742
01:50:06,770 --> 01:50:07,630
As like...

2743
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:10,450
As like a reminder of what I did.

2744
01:50:10,710 --> 01:50:11,990
Not the egg goon.

2745
01:50:12,570 --> 01:50:14,550
I don't know what's gonna happen to you.

2746
01:50:14,690 --> 01:50:16,210
But I'm gonna sell you, my child.

2747
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:19,770
Alright.

2748
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:19,950
Alright.

2749
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:23,750
Where are the egg goons at?

2750
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:24,950
Where are the egg goons?

2751
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:26,130
Yeah, where are you guys?

2752
01:50:26,550 --> 01:50:28,170
Where are the egg goons in my chat?

2753
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:31,130
Jarhods, I'm gonna fuck you.

2754
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:35,210
Say goodbye, Jarhods.

2755
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:36,530
You're gonna work for Big Kitty.

2756
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,450
That's your new life.

2757
01:50:42,570 --> 01:50:44,810
Now you're about to be sold to Big Kitty.

2758
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:47,770
You're gonna be working for Hello Kitty.

2759
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:48,730
Till you die.

2760
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:50,010
After I sell you.

2761
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:54,250
That's right.

2762
01:50:55,110 --> 01:50:56,750
The horror is real.

2763
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:58,430
Goodbye.

2764
01:51:02,570 --> 01:51:03,950
Alright, let's grab this.

2765
01:51:04,210 --> 01:51:05,730
I still don't know what to do with this.

2766
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:10,970
Sold into the life of hardship at birth.

2767
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:12,730
Welcome to the industrial revolution.

2768
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:15,270
Now you...

2769
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:15,630
Welcome.

2770
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:18,410
Now you know what...

2771
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:20,490
Honestly, that's basically the industrial revolution.

2772
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:23,230
Back then, the poor would have so many kids.

2773
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:25,150
So they can send the children to the factories.

2774
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:26,950
And then when the child dies.

2775
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:28,290
By being crushed by machinery.

2776
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:29,670
They just pop another kid.

2777
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:31,730
And be like, alright, off to work you go.

2778
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:36,270
That's gonna be your...

2779
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:36,710
Jarhod.

2780
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:40,010
That's gonna be a woman.

2781
01:51:40,010 --> 01:51:41,270
Into the factory.

2782
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:43,210
To make those Hello Kitty products.

2783
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:46,150
Why do you think merch is so...

2784
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:47,910
Why do you think merch is so popular?

2785
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:49,630
In Sanrio.

2786
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:51,770
It's off to the...

2787
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:53,270
Factory you go, Jarhod.

2788
01:51:53,670 --> 01:51:56,270
You're gonna be out there making Hello Kitty pencils.

2789
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:57,350
And plushies.

2790
01:51:58,790 --> 01:51:59,970
Is that great?

2791
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:08,310
My child, I wonder how much money you'll get for me.

2792
01:52:08,330 --> 01:52:09,030
My child.

2793
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:10,990
No, please.

2794
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:12,330
Out of the womb.

2795
01:52:12,530 --> 01:52:13,870
And straight to the tomb.

2796
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:20,530
Spare him of this fate.

2797
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:22,110
Alright.

2798
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:24,010
Off you go.

2799
01:52:25,890 --> 01:52:28,650
I wonder how much money you're gonna fetch me.

2800
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:29,570
Little guy.

2801
01:52:33,290 --> 01:52:33,970
Please.

2802
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:35,530
He's but a lad.

2803
01:52:36,370 --> 01:52:38,070
Best time to start.

2804
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:38,290
Alright.

2805
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:41,090
He'll learn faster at birth.

2806
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:46,790
Alright.

2807
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:48,230
I'm heading over.

2808
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:03,210
He's never known freedom.

2809
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:04,550
That's the best part.

2810
01:53:08,070 --> 01:53:08,290
How much money?

2811
01:53:08,430 --> 01:53:11,150
You're only $50?!

2812
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:12,490
Oh my god.

2813
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:15,090
That's fine.

2814
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:16,890
That's fine.

2815
01:53:17,110 --> 01:53:18,410
$50 is $50.

2816
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:19,830
I'm okay with that.

2817
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:22,730
That's alright.

2818
01:53:23,230 --> 01:53:23,650
Goodbye.

2819
01:53:24,010 --> 01:53:25,130
Off to the mines you go.

2820
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:26,450
My $50 child.

2821
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:30,830
That's okay.

2822
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:33,390
Off to the mines you go.

2823
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:35,190
My $50 child.

2824
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:37,290
I am okay with that.

2825
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:41,050
The egg yearns for the mines.

2826
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:43,350
The shell sharpen it.

2827
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:45,390
The shell grind it.

2828
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:49,770
I had to purchase this one by one.

2829
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:50,830
That's so fucked.

2830
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:52,710
That's actually...

2831
01:53:52,710 --> 01:53:55,410
Your body gave me...

2832
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:57,690
That allowed me to purchase half of...

2833
01:53:57,690 --> 01:53:58,670
Animal feed.

2834
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:00,310
To produce more children.

2835
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:03,690
Thank you for your service, child.

2836
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:10,260
Your body lets me...

2837
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:11,920
Produce more eggs.

2838
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,240
Goodbye, jar hoods.

2839
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:15,700
Goodbye.

2840
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:19,400
This is gonna be a long cry.

2841
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,540
Okay, I need to eat my natto.

2842
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:27,340
Yeah, still net positive.

2843
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:28,780
That's all that matters.

2844
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:30,200
I'm still net positive.

2845
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:33,680
I'm almost there to the cow, guys.

2846
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:34,620
We're almost there.

2847
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:36,080
I just wanna look at the cow.

2848
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:37,580
That's all I want.

2849
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,840
I just wanna see the cow.

2850
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:41,820
I wanna say hello to him.

2851
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,560
Be like, hello big boy.

2852
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:46,040
I did this all for you.

2853
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,120
I sold a child for you.

2854
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:51,980
Do I have honey yet?

2855
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:56,240
No, I don't.

2856
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:57,680
It's like five days.

2857
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:59,240
How is it not five days yet?

2858
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:00,920
Alright, back to sleep I go.

2859
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:05,280
Sleep I go.

2860
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:09,260
I need more food.

2861
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,880
I'll eat my fluffy pancakes.

2862
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,480
I mean, maybe I'll sell the plushie.

2863
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:16,540
I don't care much about the plushie or the algae.

2864
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:19,560
I need more money anyway.

2865
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:23,380
Oh, I forgot to feed my chicken!

2866
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:25,640
Oh, fuck.

2867
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:25,920
Okay.

2868
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:27,080
I mean, it's one day.

2869
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:28,800
It's one day.

2870
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:29,480
It's fine.

2871
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:31,520
It's one day.

2872
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,800
Oh, tomorrow is the festival!

2873
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,120
I sold my son for $50.

2874
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:38,920
Oh shit, it's already done.

2875
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:39,360
Nice.

2876
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:41,440
That's good.

2877
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:42,680
Oh, they grow so fast.

2878
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:43,560
I should farm more lettuce.

2879
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:45,440
It's alright.

2880
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:46,680
I have food for them now.

2881
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:51,380
No sun selling today.

2882
01:55:55,630 --> 01:55:57,070
Hello, I have food for you.

2883
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:01,170
Alright, now they'll produce me...

2884
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:02,250
They'll produce food.

2885
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:03,650
They'll produce an egg tomorrow.

2886
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:07,250
Don't get honey, it's a scam.

2887
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:10,070
Oh yeah, I thought it reminded me.

2888
01:56:10,070 --> 01:56:11,370
I need to uninstall honey.

2889
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:14,590
Thank you for the super chat.

2890
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:15,830
Thank you, thank you.

2891
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:17,790
Jen, thank you for the super chat.

2892
01:56:17,890 --> 01:56:18,730
Thank you, thank you.

2893
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:23,510
The end of the stream will be Doki challenging Hello Kitty for control over the town.

2894
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:25,110
Oh my god.

2895
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:27,230
First off, I need... Oh wait, I need the mines.

2896
01:56:28,490 --> 01:56:29,350
I got a mine.

2897
01:56:30,170 --> 01:56:32,910
It's 2,500 for a fucking cow.

2898
01:56:33,110 --> 01:56:34,370
Oh my god, I could've just bought a cow right away.

2899
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:35,230
I didn't even need the chicken.

2900
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:39,030
Alright, it's time.

2901
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:42,130
Yeah, I have... I've always had the plug-in.

2902
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:43,530
There's my dead pumpkin.

2903
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:45,410
It's alright.

2904
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:48,350
Well, I'm just keeping it there as a reminder of my mistake.

2905
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:50,590
What it could've been.

2906
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:53,950
Well, I didn't get scammed for the pumpkin.

2907
01:56:54,130 --> 01:56:57,830
I just, for some reason, accidentally clicked the pumpkin seed.

2908
01:56:57,890 --> 01:56:58,790
I don't know how.

2909
01:56:58,790 --> 01:57:00,390
I don't...

2910
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:03,430
The worst part about this is that each rock is $1.

2911
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:07,490
So I'm literally working below minimum wage at the mine.

2912
01:57:08,290 --> 01:57:10,530
For my corporate overlord, Hello Kitty.

2913
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:12,790
I'm working like...

2914
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:14,310
It's like...

2915
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:15,870
It's $1.

2916
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:19,180
It's only $1.

2917
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:23,550
Oh my god.

2918
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:26,530
It's not even $2.

2919
01:57:26,530 --> 01:57:26,970
It's $2.

2920
01:57:28,210 --> 01:57:29,490
It's poetry.

2921
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:33,730
I'm working below minimum wage to make this work.

2922
01:57:34,190 --> 01:57:37,490
To make this work in Hello Kitty land.

2923
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:40,150
Alright.

2924
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:43,510
You can't even upgrade the mines.

2925
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:45,290
You're just stuck in this one...

2926
01:57:45,290 --> 01:57:46,970
I'm not doing parkour for the second floor.

2927
01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:48,190
That's just a waste of time.

2928
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:50,710
That's actually just a waste of time.

2929
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:54,510
Keep working.

2930
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:57,410
That's how they get you to work for the rest of your life.

2931
01:57:57,650 --> 01:58:00,870
You make barely below minimum wage.

2932
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:03,050
So you always have to work.

2933
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:04,170
You cannot stop.

2934
01:58:04,270 --> 01:58:06,530
I have to take three jobs just to get by.

2935
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:09,490
I'm a farmer, a miner, and a lumberjack.

2936
01:58:10,170 --> 01:58:13,150
Just so I can make it work in Hello Kitty town.

2937
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:14,810
The rent is insane.

2938
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:17,210
But like, where else do I live?

2939
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:20,230
Guys, either I live here or I live in the streets.

2940
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:20,690
I don't know.

2941
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:27,840
What is the exchange rate for gems?

2942
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:27,940
What is the exchange rate for gems?

2943
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:28,240
What is the exchange rate for gems?

2944
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:32,460
And you would think gems is like a lot of money.

2945
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:33,640
Because they're little gems.

2946
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:40,500
But the gems exchange rate to one American dollar is like 500 gems to one American dollar.

2947
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:41,880
It's nothing.

2948
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:43,260
It's...

2949
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:46,180
Hello Kitty fucked up the exchange rate.

2950
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:49,140
She pumped up too many gems into the market.

2951
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:50,780
So it means nothing.

2952
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:52,420
It's like one Zimbabwean dollar.

2953
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:54,060
One Zimbabwean dollar is like...

2954
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:59,020
A trillion Zimbabwean dollars is like one US dollar.

2955
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:01,960
That's how fucked up the exchange rate is now.

2956
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:06,520
Oh, and what's up, Batsumaru plushie?

2957
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,700
It's that good?

2958
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:14,260
I thought it was a thousand for a dollar.

2959
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:18,840
Welcome to international trade and economics.

2960
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,080
She inflated her currency.

2961
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:25,780
How much is it?

2962
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:27,180
That's only 50!

2963
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,520
Oh my god, that's fine.

2964
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,920
I'm gonna sell my iron.

2965
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:31,820
I can't.

2966
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:33,440
I can't.

2967
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,700
Wait, is that like $40?

2968
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,040
No.

2969
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:39,900
Okay, fuck it.

2970
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:40,820
I'm gonna sell iron.

2971
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:42,360
I don't need it anymore.

2972
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,580
I don't need it.

2973
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:49,640
I'm almost there.

2974
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:50,740
Wait, how much is this?

2975
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:51,600
Okay, that's a lot.

2976
01:59:51,700 --> 01:59:52,140
That's enough.

2977
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,580
Oh my god, it's $814.

2978
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:57,940
Okay, we're almost there.

2979
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:00,720
Okay, we gotta buy animal feed so I can make more.

2980
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:05,560
The fact that the price is...

2981
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,480
Oh my god.

2982
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,160
And then, uh...

2983
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:10,260
I'll buy more lettuce.

2984
02:00:13,910 --> 02:00:14,390
Okay.

2985
02:00:15,570 --> 02:00:17,270
And then, how much money do I have?

2986
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:19,630
How much?

2987
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:19,710
How much?

2988
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:22,770
Okay, tomorrow is the spring festival.

2989
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:24,370
Maybe I'll be happier.

2990
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:26,330
Maybe I'll be happier.

2991
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:29,230
I just need $1,500, Hello Kitty.

2992
02:00:29,550 --> 02:00:30,530
I just need...

2993
02:00:30,530 --> 02:00:32,430
Please, can I take a loan?

2994
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:34,130
Miss Hello Kitty, please.

2995
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:35,650
Just one loan.

2996
02:00:36,150 --> 02:00:37,690
Please, it's my dream.

2997
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:40,610
It's my dream to have a cow.

2998
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:42,570
Please, just one.

2999
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:44,850
You know I'm good for it, Miss Kitty.

3000
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:46,250
You know that.

3001
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:47,670
I'm good for it.

3002
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:52,130
I'm good for it.

3003
02:00:53,290 --> 02:00:54,230
No, it doesn't.

3004
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:56,710
It just controls the page.

3005
02:00:58,230 --> 02:00:59,630
Oh, maybe I can fish.

3006
02:01:00,650 --> 02:01:01,930
Maybe I can fish.

3007
02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:05,790
There is no loan.

3008
02:01:05,910 --> 02:01:07,370
Go back to mine.

3009
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:09,350
Miss Kitty, please.

3010
02:01:09,590 --> 02:01:10,750
Please, Miss Kitty.

3011
02:01:11,490 --> 02:01:14,470
I just need $1,000, Miss Kitty.

3012
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:16,770
You know I can pay you back.

3013
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:17,430
Please.

3014
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:20,830
Maybe I can fish for food.

3015
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:22,150
Fish for money.

3016
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:25,270
Fishing for money.

3017
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:27,850
Oh my god, my tin can.

3018
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:29,410
My $1 tin can.

3019
02:01:30,430 --> 02:01:31,910
Oh look, I got a jar though.

3020
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:33,790
So that means I don't have to buy jars at least.

3021
02:01:37,630 --> 02:01:39,570
Oh my god, it's literally just tin cans.

3022
02:01:40,030 --> 02:01:41,770
A dystopian nightmare.

3023
02:01:43,530 --> 02:01:45,130
Anything for a cow.

3024
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:48,570
Oh, I was too late.

3025
02:01:50,770 --> 02:01:51,770
Wait, what?

3026
02:01:57,610 --> 02:01:58,870
What the fuck?

3027
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:00,330
Why can't I catch anything?

3028
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:03,830
I reeled it instantly.

3029
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:09,010
Oh my god, you gotta be like...

3030
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:10,030
Instant, instant.

3031
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:13,070
That's so dumb.

3032
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:13,670
Wait, what did I get?

3033
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:15,190
I got an old tire.

3034
02:02:16,110 --> 02:02:17,170
Does that work?

3035
02:02:17,490 --> 02:02:18,950
Do old tires work for wheels?

3036
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:24,110
Oh my god, I gotcha.

3037
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:27,570
No, it's still polluted.

3038
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:28,610
There is still...

3039
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:29,990
There's nothing here anymore.

3040
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:35,060
Hi from Indonesia.

3041
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:36,600
Thank you for the super chat.

3042
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:37,740
Thank you, thank you.

3043
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:41,320
Akoyuki, thank you for the super chat.

3044
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:42,260
Thank you, thank you.

3045
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:45,460
Oh my god, I'm just...

3046
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:46,900
We're polluting this world.

3047
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:49,920
Hellkitty's hiding something.

3048
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:52,620
There's no fish in this.

3049
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:53,840
These aren't even real fish.

3050
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:55,860
All I've been fishing is just...

3051
02:02:55,860 --> 02:02:57,980
It's just algae, tires, and trash.

3052
02:03:04,030 --> 02:03:04,990
And jars.

3053
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:06,550
Is there anything else?

3054
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:08,910
Oh, I'm fucking...

3055
02:03:08,910 --> 02:03:09,370
I give up.

3056
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:11,810
The truth is out there.

3057
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:13,450
Doki, just keep fishing.

3058
02:03:13,830 --> 02:03:14,950
The truth is out there.

3059
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:16,270
Uncover the truth.

3060
02:03:17,910 --> 02:03:20,610
This whole world is a lie, Doki.

3061
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:26,290
Alright, what do I get?

3062
02:03:26,430 --> 02:03:28,030
Oh my god, a chiffon machine.

3063
02:03:29,290 --> 02:03:30,770
What do I get?

3064
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:34,350
I got a chandelier.

3065
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:36,330
Yay, I'm gonna sell this.

3066
02:03:36,650 --> 02:03:38,210
Wait, it's Kuromi's chandelier!

3067
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:39,250
She touched it!

3068
02:03:40,190 --> 02:03:41,690
Okay, but how much is it?

3069
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:43,070
Oh my...

3070
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:44,370
I'm sorry, it's $800.

3071
02:03:44,850 --> 02:03:45,630
I'm sorry, I can't.

3072
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:52,190
It's $800, guys.

3073
02:03:52,290 --> 02:03:53,030
I have to.

3074
02:03:55,190 --> 02:03:57,290
And then I'll give her algae.

3075
02:03:57,790 --> 02:03:59,330
And then...

3076
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:00,970
I don't need all these jars.

3077
02:04:01,570 --> 02:04:02,610
How much is a jar?

3078
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:04,210
It's not even that much.

3079
02:04:04,330 --> 02:04:05,410
Oh, fuck it.

3080
02:04:07,830 --> 02:04:09,690
I might as well...

3081
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:12,970
I'll sell two.

3082
02:04:13,730 --> 02:04:15,430
I'll keep one of the jars for honey.

3083
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:18,770
Alright, nice.

3084
02:04:19,110 --> 02:04:20,090
I'm almost there.

3085
02:04:20,290 --> 02:04:21,490
I'm almost there.

3086
02:04:22,930 --> 02:04:24,730
I'm almost there, guys.

3087
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:31,280
You must break your adorable chain.

3088
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:34,740
Kuromi would understand.

3089
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:37,680
I'm in financial burden right now.

3090
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:41,860
She'll understand that I sold a chandelier touched by Miss Kuromi.

3091
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:42,880
She'll understand.

3092
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:45,960
It's like when you're like in debt and you have to sell the TokiBird.

3093
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:48,660
A TokiBird signed print.

3094
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:49,940
And you're like...

3095
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:51,820
But I won't.

3096
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:52,660
I won't understand.

3097
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:53,600
You're dead to me.

3098
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:57,380
I signed that print with my own hands.

3099
02:04:58,300 --> 02:05:00,620
You're dead to me if you sell my merch.

3100
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:04,580
If you sold merch that you bought.

3101
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:11,000
I won't be understanding like Kuromi.

3102
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:14,460
Wait, have I fed them yet?

3103
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:16,520
I'll figure it out tomorrow.

3104
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:18,640
If I fed them.

3105
02:05:20,860 --> 02:05:22,560
Alright, tomorrow is the Spring Festival.

3106
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:25,080
Exactly.

3107
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:28,280
My presents will keep you warm.

3108
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,380
Oh my god, $600.

3109
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:31,460
It's just $600.

3110
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,760
$600 left.

3111
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:40,360
And then, it'll be 5.

3112
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:43,140
It's raining in the Spring Festival?

3113
02:05:43,140 --> 02:05:45,450
What kind of fucked up world is this?

3114
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,040
Oh my god, today is the Spring Festival.

3115
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:54,440
And it's raining.

3116
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,100
I'm gonna sell my cat.

3117
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,520
I'm desperate.

3118
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:05,440
Oh no, it's sunny.

3119
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:06,300
Yay!

3120
02:06:09,940 --> 02:06:11,120
It's sunny.

3121
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:13,260
Don't worry.

3122
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:13,380
Don't worry.

3123
02:06:17,260 --> 02:06:18,140
Harvest, harvest.

3124
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:20,340
I should have enough now.

3125
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:23,360
If I'm mine today, I should have enough.

3126
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:24,540
And if I sell a child.

3127
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:26,680
Alright.

3128
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:30,580
Thank you, thank you.

3129
02:06:30,580 --> 02:06:33,560
How do you still not have fucking hair yet?

3130
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:34,740
Alright, get over here, chicken.

3131
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:39,140
Oh my god, is that two chicken eggs?

3132
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:40,740
Alright, who am I selling here?

3133
02:06:41,180 --> 02:06:42,960
Speaking of Hello Kitty, what type of pledge do you have?

3134
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:43,500
Like collecting.

3135
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:45,380
I remember back from the day that you have a decent collection.

3136
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:46,900
But don't remember much more than that.

3137
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,320
Mostly Kuromi and...

3138
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,500
It'll be Kuromi and Hapamonpuren.

3139
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:51,840
And Tsunomoto.

3140
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:53,980
Alright, who's child am I selling?

3141
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:57,420
Oh shit, I just remembered the pull list.

3142
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,520
Thanks, Jarhods.

3143
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:00,340
Thanks, go back to the factory now.

3144
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:05,320
Alright.

3145
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:07,760
Alright, who is it?

3146
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:10,020
Oh, alright, eggs.

3147
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,420
Who's going to the corporate?

3148
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:13,720
Who's gonna work for your corporate over there?

3149
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:16,100
You have been born to be sold.

3150
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:19,580
Alright, I think like if I mine a little bit more today.

3151
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:21,320
I should be able to afford...

3152
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:22,900
I should be able to afford a cow.

3153
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:27,320
Egggoons.

3154
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:29,160
It's time, egggoon.

3155
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:31,020
It's time.

3156
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,540
It's time to go to the factory.

3157
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:36,860
Where are my egggies at?

3158
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:38,300
Where are you?

3159
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:39,440
You have been born.

3160
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,020
You have been chosen.

3161
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:43,080
Oh my god.

3162
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:46,500
You have been chosen to do something wonderful today.

3163
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:48,900
For a wonderful, glorious leader.

3164
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:49,680
Hello, kitty.

3165
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:53,480
Alright, you're working for Pizza Hut.

3166
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:55,640
That's alright.

3167
02:07:56,220 --> 02:07:56,980
Oh, Tan.

3168
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,660
Hello, Tan.

3169
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:00,580
Oh my god.

3170
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:02,560
I hope you have fun.

3171
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:09,120
Tan.

3172
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:10,500
Alright.

3173
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:12,160
It's time.

3174
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:16,140
You have been born to do something very special today.

3175
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,200
You have been born to give me a...

3176
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,500
To be part of the cow funds.

3177
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:24,620
No, don't.

3178
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:26,240
No, I don't take tomatoes.

3179
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:28,120
I only take eggs.

3180
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:30,180
No volunteers here.

3181
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:31,340
You can't volunteer yourself.

3182
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:33,280
You're just a little tomato.

3183
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:36,240
You haven't grown to be an egg yet.

3184
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:38,380
Goodbye, Tan.

3185
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:41,580
Get ready to serve Hello Kitty.

3186
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:42,580
For $50.

3187
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:45,020
All I got was $50.

3188
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:46,780
That's okay.

3189
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:50,040
Just $1 closer to the cow.

3190
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:53,500
$1 closer to the cow.

3191
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:56,620
Oh hey, what does that bitch Melody has to say?

3192
02:08:57,540 --> 02:09:00,580
Blueprints are a big investment, but they allow you to have a bigger and better house.

3193
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,360
Imagine all that space for decorating.

3194
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:03,980
That's it?

3195
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:08,580
That's all she's gonna say to me?

3196
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:11,640
Kotoki, why?

3197
02:09:12,140 --> 02:09:13,280
You know why.

3198
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:15,140
It's all for the cow.

3199
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:17,580
You know why.

3200
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:19,260
Goodbye, Tan.

3201
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:21,200
My $50, Tan.

3202
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:24,460
And that should be almost there.

3203
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:25,420
Oh, there you go!

3204
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:28,060
I don't even need to sell you for the cow!

3205
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:28,980
Goodbye.

3206
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:35,300
Yeah!

3207
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:38,140
I got a cow!

3208
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:44,570
I did it!

3209
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:47,890
Alright, let's go to the festival.

3210
02:09:48,910 --> 02:09:50,690
What is there at the spring festival?

3211
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:56,790
I understand she wants to talk to me, but she also doesn't want to talk to me?

3212
02:09:57,630 --> 02:09:59,430
Welcome to the spring festival.

3213
02:09:59,930 --> 02:10:01,750
How do I participate in it?

3214
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:04,950
How do I participate in the spring festival?

3215
02:10:06,830 --> 02:10:08,110
I don't understand.

3216
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:09,330
Is it time yet?

3217
02:10:11,730 --> 02:10:12,130
Hello?

3218
02:10:14,090 --> 02:10:15,890
Miss Kitty, how do I participate?

3219
02:10:18,570 --> 02:10:20,230
Have you tried a capsule machine?

3220
02:10:20,530 --> 02:10:21,390
Okay, guys.

3221
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:21,830
Hello?

3222
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:27,630
My melody won't even talk to me!

3223
02:10:28,450 --> 02:10:29,650
I'm sorry!

3224
02:10:29,870 --> 02:10:32,490
I shouldn't be the Kaguya bitch!

3225
02:10:33,710 --> 02:10:35,370
Who get the pass today?

3226
02:10:35,490 --> 02:10:37,290
Okay, I'm gonna go break into this person's house.

3227
02:10:37,450 --> 02:10:38,490
And then...

3228
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:40,930
And then get out.

3229
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:47,470
I waited 8 days for this.

3230
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:48,750
I...

3231
02:10:48,750 --> 02:10:50,830
I waited 8 days for this.

3232
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:52,950
It doesn't matter?

3233
02:10:55,710 --> 02:10:56,910
It doesn't...

3234
02:10:57,310 --> 02:10:58,530
I waited 8 days.

3235
02:10:58,990 --> 02:11:00,570
I've waited 8 days, Melody!

3236
02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:02,530
Where's my spring festival?

3237
02:11:02,530 --> 02:11:03,630
That's right!

3238
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:05,330
Where is it?

3239
02:11:06,570 --> 02:11:08,050
Where's my spring festival?

3240
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:10,310
Miss Melody, where is it?

3241
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:12,490
Where is my spring festival?

3242
02:11:12,930 --> 02:11:14,010
I worked hard for this.

3243
02:11:14,230 --> 02:11:15,010
Where is it?

3244
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:20,630
Where is it?

3245
02:11:24,570 --> 02:11:27,350
Where the fuck is my spring festival?

3246
02:11:28,110 --> 02:11:29,930
How do I celebrate spring?

3247
02:11:29,930 --> 02:11:30,310
Spring!

3248
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:33,110
Sadness angry.

3249
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:35,010
Sadness groovy.

3250
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:37,830
How do I celebrate spring?

3251
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:43,680
I'm so sad.

3252
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,160
I'm so sad.

3253
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:46,860
I worked so hard to be here.

3254
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:47,960
I'm...

3255
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:49,980
I'm so sad.

3256
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:52,200
What can I do?

3257
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:55,080
There is only...

3258
02:11:55,780 --> 02:11:57,520
What do I give them?

3259
02:11:58,200 --> 02:11:59,420
Do you want my tablet?

3260
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:01,020
I have nothing.

3261
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:03,400
I have food.

3262
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:07,500
Do you want my tire?

3263
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:16,080
What spring festival?

3264
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:21,540
I worked so hard in the mud.

3265
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:25,340
And I don't even get to celebrate spring?

3266
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:30,180
What's the point?

3267
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:30,260
What's the point?

3268
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:33,960
I just...

3269
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:36,480
I get to watch the others have fun?

3270
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:42,280
It said spring festival.

3271
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:46,840
I have a level one friendship.

3272
02:12:49,740 --> 02:12:51,020
I got got.

3273
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,040
I actually got got.

3274
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:55,200
I thought...

3275
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:57,180
I worked so hard.

3276
02:12:57,180 --> 02:13:00,420
But it doesn't matter.

3277
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:03,100
It's okay, I have my cow.

3278
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:07,060
Look at him.

3279
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:09,160
He's so cute.

3280
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:11,360
Hello, cow.

3281
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,620
Hello, there.

3282
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:17,440
I sold two children for you.

3283
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:19,540
Hello, my cow.

3284
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:21,580
Hello, there.

3285
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:23,500
That's my cow.

3286
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:23,580
Hello, cow.

3287
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:28,020
I sold two kids to get him.

3288
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:29,060
Moo.

3289
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:35,960
It only took me two children.

3290
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:41,800
I thought I could end the playthrough.

3291
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:44,960
By going to the spring festival.

3292
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:48,100
And celebrating with my Oshi.

3293
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:50,480
And my Kami Oshi.

3294
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:52,320
And my backup Oshi.

3295
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:54,960
When my main Oshi isn't online and streaming.

3296
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:56,440
Then I guess I'll watch you.

3297
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:01,360
Don't think I don't know.

3298
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:03,500
I'm that Oshi for some of you guys.

3299
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,040
Don't think I don't know.

3300
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:14,040
Reality is often disappointing.

3301
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:14,420
The...

3302
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:20,460
The call of...

3303
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,160
Paranoid.

3304
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:25,360
I don't understand.

3305
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:31,800
Why doesn't my Melody let me celebrate the spring festival?

3306
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:35,220
No, no, that's not me.

3307
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:37,300
No, Toki, no.

3308
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:38,840
That's not me.

3309
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:40,160
Oh, no.

3310
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:45,720
Okay.

3311
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:47,720
Maybe if I go to her house.

3312
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:49,680
She'll like reset herself.

3313
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:52,280
And then I can celebrate the spring festival.

3314
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:58,420
Maybe if you can celebrate the spring festival in the cave.

3315
02:14:58,920 --> 02:14:59,420
Thank you.

3316
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:01,060
Thank you.

3317
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:03,840
Maybe I can reset her.

3318
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:07,400
Okay, alright.

3319
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:10,140
And then I'll come outside.

3320
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:12,640
And then she should be reset, right?

3321
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:15,920
She should be reset now, right?

3322
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:22,400
Can I celebrate the spring festival now, Miss Melody?

3323
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:25,300
Can I...

3324
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:27,860
Can I be part of...

3325
02:15:27,860 --> 02:15:30,000
Can I be part of the team?

3326
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:34,460
I... I don't understand!

3327
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:36,060
Okay, guys.

3328
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:36,680
I'm desperate.

3329
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:37,460
Give me a sec.

3330
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:38,340
I'm desperate.

3331
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:39,780
I just...

3332
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:42,220
I wanna... I wanna celebrate.

3333
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:43,720
I wanna...

3334
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:44,240
Please.

3335
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:47,940
Thank you.

3336
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:49,260
Thank you.

3337
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:52,000
There's barely anyone living in this town.

3338
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:52,340
Thank you.

3339
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:54,060
Thank you.

3340
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:54,760
Please.

3341
02:15:55,460 --> 02:15:57,480
Can I celebrate?

3342
02:15:57,860 --> 02:15:59,480
Why can't I be?

3343
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:03,540
I'm waving.

3344
02:16:06,580 --> 02:16:08,200
Please, Melody.

3345
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:08,640
Please.

3346
02:16:10,060 --> 02:16:11,500
I'm gonna wave.

3347
02:16:12,280 --> 02:16:14,420
I'm gonna...

3348
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:14,880
Whoa!

3349
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:16,240
Over here.

3350
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:17,160
I'm clapping.

3351
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:19,060
Can I be part of...

3352
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:20,200
Please, I'm clapping.

3353
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,040
I'm clapping.

3354
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:23,720
Isn't this what you want?

3355
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:25,080
Please.

3356
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:27,120
Let me join.

3357
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:32,420
I just wanna be part of the festival.

3358
02:16:33,980 --> 02:16:35,200
I wanna...

3359
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:39,420
Why can't I...

3360
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:43,160
I wanted to end the stream at the festival.

3361
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:45,120
I can't.

3362
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:49,540
Please don't make me go back to the mines.

3363
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:51,360
Please.

3364
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:54,220
Don't make me go back to the mines.

3365
02:16:56,260 --> 02:16:57,660
I don't understand.

3366
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:59,880
I did everything you wanted, Hello Kitty.

3367
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:02,620
I did... Hello, Hello Kitty.

3368
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:05,320
I did everything you want.

3369
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:06,220
What more?

3370
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:07,780
I sold you my children.

3371
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:10,560
What more do you want, Hello Kitty?

3372
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:13,200
Why can't I join the festival?

3373
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:20,740
Thank you for the super chat.

3374
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:21,080
Thank you.

3375
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:25,760
I managed to escape the birdies' authorities.

3376
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:28,820
I'll now accomplish my mission from women, the corporal, the yellow men.

3377
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,560
Stay tuned, dragons, and wish me luck.

3378
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:33,480
Thank you for the super chat.

3379
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:35,020
Thank you, thank you.

3380
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:37,860
Everybody's going home.

3381
02:17:38,300 --> 02:17:42,600
And I can't even celebrate the goddamn festival.

3382
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:47,000
All I can do is watch.

3383
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:52,640
What a fucked up day.

3384
02:17:53,460 --> 02:17:57,020
What a fucked up day today.

3385
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:01,840
I worked so hard.

3386
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:03,880
I got my cow.

3387
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:05,340
I mined.

3388
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:10,760
But I couldn't even enjoy the celebrations.

3389
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:17,840
They won't even invite me to the celebration, guys.

3390
02:18:19,580 --> 02:18:21,120
I talked to her.

3391
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:26,300
And all she says is I'd love to come by your farm.

3392
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:29,220
You have a favorite crop?

3393
02:18:29,220 --> 02:18:30,980
I'd love to come by your farm.

3394
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:32,340
Do you have a favorite crop?

3395
02:18:33,340 --> 02:18:34,980
Blueprints are a bit of investment.

3396
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:37,060
I'd love to come by your farm.

3397
02:18:42,980 --> 02:18:44,820
It's night time.

3398
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:46,380
It's night time.

3399
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,420
The festival is over.

3400
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:52,640
I wasn't even invited.

3401
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:57,020
I wasn't invited.

3402
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:00,120
Guys, I think she's lost it.

3403
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,980
Thank you for the super chat.

3404
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:02,440
Thank you.

3405
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:08,800
What a fucked up way to end today's stream, guys.

3406
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,060
What a fucked up way.

3407
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:14,040
I had...

3408
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:22,900
I had a wonderful corporate life in Hello Kitty town working for my glorious leader, Miss Kitty.

3409
02:19:23,720 --> 02:19:28,400
I can't wait to do this all over again, everyone.

3410
02:19:28,780 --> 02:19:32,780
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

3411
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:34,540
Posture check.

3412
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:39,300
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3413
02:19:39,900 --> 02:19:45,500
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

3414
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:50,540
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3415
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:52,880
Bye-bye, guys.

3416
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:54,840
Bye-bye.
