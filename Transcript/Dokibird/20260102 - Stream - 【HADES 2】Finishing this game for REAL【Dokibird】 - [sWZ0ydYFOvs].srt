We'll put it.

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:43,490
All right.

44
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:45,890
All right.

45
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,670
What do you mean?

46
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,990
I've never clickbaited you guys ever in my life.

47
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:50,970
Well, yeah.

48
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,150
I want to talk about this.

49
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,970
I'm just sleeping a lot.

50
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,490
The last couple of days, because, like I said, I know I keep
saying a lot.

51
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,330
December was truly my hell month.

52
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,090
So my body is perpetually trying to catch up on sleep debt.

53
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,430
So I woke up in the morning.

54
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,430
I don't know.

55
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,270
I don't even remember this.

56
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,690
I woke up in the morning and then I wrote, I have an ideas
Discord server.

57
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,450
I put all my ideas in for stream ideas or like merch ideas
or anything like regarding content and stuff.

58
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,570
And then I woke up.

59
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:37,250
I wrote this down And then I went back to sleep And I don't
know what it means I don't know what this means What the

60
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,390
fuck does I'm like Is this like related to Uber Eats?

61
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,810
Was I hungry?

62
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:50,110
I mean I was hungry So I was like Was I so hungry that my
subconscious woke up And was like I want to order Uber Eats

63
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,410
Like I don't understand Understand this was in my idea
server past Doki.

64
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,090
What does this mean?

65
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,310
What the fuck does dragon eat me?

66
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:14,150
I couldn't I like literally when I woke up I spent like I
think like 15 to 20 minutes in bed Trying to figure out Like

67
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:24,150
decipher like like tracing my steps back being like what led
past Doki to write this down and I I couldn't figure it out

68
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,810
I was, like, looking at my history and my phone history and
everything.

69
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,550
Like, was I looking at something specifically?

70
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,510
And I don't know.

71
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,630
I don't know what this means.

72
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,150
And I still don't know.

73
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,450
I don't know if it was, like, Fast Turkey was trying to
think of, like, a fast food service or some shit.

74
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,390
But it doesn't make sense.

75
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:47,490
I can't figure out what exactly am I trying to do with,
like, Uber Eats or some shit.

76
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,490
I don't know.

77
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,670
It'll forever be an enigma.

78
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,130
It'll be forever a mystery, an unsolved hit mystery.

79
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,610
Doki lore.

80
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,630
Doki Raid, I am from the future.

81
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,790
Please, you have to remember, Dragon Eats.

82
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,950
Dragon Eats, what, Doki?

83
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,910
Dragon Eats, what?

84
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,990
Truly a mystery lost in time.

85
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,710
But yeah, I was hoping that maybe it'll trigger something if
I mention it to you guys, but I still don't know.

86
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,550
I'm reading all your comments as stone folk fucking know
what's up.

87
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,410
this means.

88
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,830
What brilliant idea did past Doki have?

89
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,010
And now I can't even make it into a reality because that's
all she wrote.

90
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,770
She didn't elaborate anything else.

91
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:43,550
She'll be like, obviously, if I write this present, Doki's
going to understand what she rereads this back.

92
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,750
But I don't.

93
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,870
You don't understand past Doki.

94
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,830
You should have been more specific.

95
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,790
I don't know will never make this a reality because of it.

96
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,770
We'll never know.

97
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:12,870
So unfortunately, this idea will be forever lost in time
because I have no fucking idea what past Doki wanted to do.

98
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:30,390
It's very unfortunate that we'll never be able to see this
amazing idea come to light whatever it could be whatever she

99
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:42,330
imagined envisioned in their head before she went back to
sleep thank you for the break thank you i hope you had a

100
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:52,370
great stream over there um maybe it's best for god and we'll
never know it could have been my next masterpiece but we'll

101
00:10:52,370 --> 00:11:00,770
never know out that i'm live now real quick all right anyway
like i said today we're gonna finish it soon the first

102
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:11,290

and hopefully hopefully only four runs i pray to god it's

103
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:23,130
just gonna be four runs uh is it is one run is already like
that surface world the surface world is truly it truly it

104
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,490
should be hell Like, they should just swap hell in the
surface world.

105
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,670
Surface world is much worse than hell right now.

106
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,230
I hate...

107
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,770
I hate the last level.

108
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,770
The last level is actually so fucking hard.

109
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,870
The goddamn monsters.

110
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,770
I gotta warm...

111
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,190
The worst part is warming up.

112
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,870
We have to warm up live.

113
00:11:51,910 --> 00:12:03,490
all right yeah hopefully i get four perfect runs in a row
all right here we go also i realize i forgot to mention this

earth day gotta collect the trash do we have anyone else

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:29,500

assembled accounts of doki's to crack this mystery well

124
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,060
you're not gonna and even if you do you'll look back on this
and wish things were no i do not i could have finished this

125
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:41,180
game like in 2025 this game would have been done in 2025

126
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,360
i feel self-conscious singing on olympus oh game is a little
low i can up it up a bit

127
00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:03,340
uh let me know what's better yeah oh i wonder did the
weavings of the i have sound got here today father of all

128
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:11,840
monsters down the mountain last night he didn't see it
coming at least no not as such the weavings of the fates

129
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,480
tend not to be precise in their detail which i know can make
i haven't even met the fates yet i assume i meet them like

130
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,560
when i beat the game i'd like to think that i foretold it
because they're Like, kidnapped by my grandpa.

131
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,640
Oh, it was fine?

132
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,940
Guys, is it good or not?

133
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,320
Okay, wait.

134
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,160
I'll just put it back to what I usually do.

135
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,620
Past past Epidokie was fed up with Uber Eats messing her
orders.

136
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,620
So she said, fuck it.

137
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,500
We're making track who it eats now.

138
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,800
But last, she fell asleep.

139
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,520
Any investors want to make the next delivery service app?

140
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,340
Any investors, guys?

141
00:14:50,640 --> 00:15:01,520
We need at least like one million dollars to get to get the
uh get us started startups ever like 70 of start-ups always

142
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:12,620
fail but don't worry we're the 30 i believe in us prophecy
another victory for the unseen transmutation i got it i need

143
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:22,880
another one i know what if i try historic persuade the
learned stage will put me in real the outcomes of You're

144
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,600
every night.

145
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,760
Oh, it's post-game.

146
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,040
Oh, it's 95%.

147
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,740
95% of startups fail.

148
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,500
But don't worry, we're at the 5%.

149
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,480
I just need a small, humble investment of a million dollars
to get started.

150
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,200
What's crazy is that that's actually very low for startups.

151
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,240
As an investment, that's actually pretty low if you think
about it.

152
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
Wait, is Tartar?

153
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,140
Tartarus?

154
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,540
Tartarus?

155
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,660
Is Tartarus upstairs or downstairs?

156
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,040
Guys, we can be the next Uber Eats, guys.

157
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
That's what passed Doki wanted.

158
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,920
Oh, that's downstairs, and we don't need to...

159
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,140
We don't need to get it, then.

160
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,280
What if I need more shadow extraction?

161
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,080
Let me double check.

162
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,500
Fabric.

163
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,040
Okay.

164
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,880
There's a small loan, Dragos.

165
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,360
I'll definitely pay you guys back.

166
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,140
Just think.

167
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,360
Just think how rich we're all gonna be.

168
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,580
Don't worry, I won't Zuckerberg, you guys.

169
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,740
If anything, you guys get to be played by Andrew Garfield.

170
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,640
Isn't that an honor?

171
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,180
If it does happen?

172
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,180
I prevailed.

173
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,420
Oh, blast.

174
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,780
I was supposed to weave a yarn.

175
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,860
kept trying to crush me with his chin but i evaded and
clamber to the top of his head where i drove the sister

176
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:08,640
blades limb and oros into his brain oh quite gruesome at the
end there i like it my only criticism if i may is that i

177
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,020
haven't played this i haven't played had these two yet is it
good it is fun they had a lot of fun stuff i just hate the

178
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,000
aries edition i just think that one was the most annoying
thing they did and also i feel like there's just it's very

179
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,240
grinding I mean, it's roguelike, but to get the first
ending, you have to do like more clears than Hades 1.

180
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,680
But like...

181
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,560
But like, the surface boss is a lot harder than Hades.

182
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,290
Another shipment already.

183
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:43,850
Oh, nice.

Oh, I can't...

193
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,440
I actually have to wait till someone shows up.

194
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,940
Oh, the strongest nectar?

195
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,820
Oh, okay.

196
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,640

00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
We wanted this, right?

199
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,300
Why, this one would be good.

200
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,440
I would never settle the beef.

201
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,640
I'm a lifelong hater.

202
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,280
Yeah, I need three fabrics and ash.

203
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,080
I can buy that.

204
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,260
I think I need one more.

205
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,420
Like, I will hate her kids' kids, too.

206
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,960
Like, they might be, like, unrelated to whatever the fuck
conflict is going on between me and Ares, but fuck her kids,

207
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,300
too.

208
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,220
My hate is generational.

209
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:23,720
I tried.

210
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,800
How many do I need?

211
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,120
I need 30, right?

212
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,920
I have like zero ashes

213
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,500
And then There you go That should be enough

214
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:53,070
Power to change It'll be worth the way Bronos must believe
he has the upper hand Now that Olympus has the father Of all

215
00:19:53,070 --> 00:20:03,490
monsters bearing down That'll be a lifeline For her too My
My children will also continue to hate I will spread the

216
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,910
I'll pass the hate down brady thank you for the super chat
thank you thank you maybe it was an idea for a membership

217
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:16,590
wallpaper dragon eating was a part of it controlled if he no
longer had olympus to contend with he would probably come

218
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:24,610
after chronos next it's like that infamous we can redirect
his uh it's probably a real thing like this um infamous

219
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:34,510
rivalry where like two families from two different hills
hated each other for like generational like for generations

220
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:40,990
and generations all because of like the I think it was like
they're like brothers or some shit and then like one fucked

221
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:49,910
over the other brother and then they they started like
hating each other from two sides of the hill yeah it was

222
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:57,750
like the hillbilly Romeo and Juliet yeah the hat fields and
McCoy's yeah yeah we're the yeah that's right we're the hat

223
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:08,010
fields and McCoy's oh I don't know Oh, you mean Team
Fortress 2 lore was based on the real actual people of the

224
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,290
Hatfields and Magu- You're related to them?

225
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,670
Aren't they, like, super inbred too?

226
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:21,210
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I remember reading,
like, their history and they were, like, they were, like,

227
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,270
semi-inbred, weren't they?

228
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,390
Like, I don't get what it is.

229
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,910
Like, but they got better.

230
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,990
I know they got better.

231
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,930
You're right, but dad.

232
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,010
Literally, my wife is related to them, and I'm, of course,
super far back.

233
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,010
So she always says legally, she can't stream me as she hits
me with a nerve.

234
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,850
You can fix it.

235
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,390
I think it's fixed now, though.

236
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,830
I think it's fixed now.

237
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,070
It's been, like, like, decades.

238
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,190
They got better

239
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,070

fixed the gene pool if not his rage they start they stop

243
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:31,990
doing that I hope That our craft is never to be used for
destruction alone But no rule is immutable Our enemies'

244
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,490
strengths against them.

245
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,130
To rid us of them all.

246
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,510
Disintegration of monstrosity.

247
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,010
We got a new incantation.

248
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,070
Yeah, we should be.

249
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,290
I don't know.

00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,670
This is our audio.

251
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,610
This has always been our audio.

252
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,410
You actually...

253
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,150
Well, apparently there's a lot of descendants of the
half-fields.

254
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:16,890
and macaws like they got i mean there was nothing to do back
there it was there was nothing i got surprised i'm surprised

255
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:28,370
that there's a lot of dragons here that have like um vague
relations to the half fields and macaws who even said that

256
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:37,910
to Sorry, buddy.

257
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,510

258
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,590
Oh, my God.

259
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,090
No, he disappeared.

260
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,390
He never came back.

261
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:56,670
I'm trying to see in my chat if he ever said anything after
I said that.

262
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,670
Oh, he's crying.

263
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,190

Sweet old Tokilanda.

271
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,060
Let's see.

272
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,400
Wait, they're still feuding?

273
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,280
Wait, actually, I gotta...

274
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,120
Don't worry, we're still going.

275
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,660
Hatfields and McCoy's.

276
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,900
How?

277
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,860
How are they still fighting?

278
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,020
Now.

279
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,700
Today...

280
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,360
Oh, they're...

281
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,840
Yeah, their agenda despite the feud ending in a 2003 true
that is way too recent.

282
00:24:50,220 --> 00:25:01,760
I know that's like 20 years ago, but like that's 2003 seems
way too recent for a feud to like have a truce right now

283
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:17,140
That's crazy Yeah, that's gonna be me and Aeris that's gonna
be how I tell it, yeah, it's generational hate.

284
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:28,420
Yeah, a foremost truce was signed in the 2003, officially
ending hostilities from the late 1800s.

285
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,520
Let's reinstate the feud.

286
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,760
Let's send in like, it's like in Fallout where they're like,
we will detonate the bomb ourselves.

287
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,120
We send in like a fake bomb.

288
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,000
is from the mccoy's

289
00:25:49,880 --> 00:26:00,180
but there's a lot of like um lots of media based off that
parodies I mean Team Fortress 2 was literally parodying um

The wind Siding me up Yeah, that means like anything.

296
00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:06,550
Oh, I mean I'm a warped profiteer I'll sell I'll make money
off of the off of it What did I use?

297
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,690
I forgot was a Zeus?

298
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,250
We needed Zeus thing, right?

299
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,290
I'll just go with Zeus.

300
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,290
What was this?

301
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:22,610
Okay, it was this I was trying to remember what was my Yeah,
assume mine was where Was the double binds, right?

302
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:22,890
No?

303
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,170
What was her?

304
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,490
Oh, wait, the double...

305
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,810
Oh, it was either double binds or the other one together.

306
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,870
Good old war economy.

307
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,050
I haven't earned it yet?

308
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,730
The three gifts of the veil to be bestowed to one deserving
of the title of Knight's Champion.

309
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:40,890
That's way too.

310
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,490
That's too much gotcha.

311
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,430
That's too much Gamba.

312
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,710
That's way too much Gamba.

313
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,710
It's just one room.

314
00:27:50,730 --> 00:28:01,210
but we don't know what room it is to get some of that
eternal glory eternal glory if such a thing may come to

315
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:08,950
those who manage to achieve extraordinary feats so be it but
to chase glory as a goal onto itself that can't be right at

316
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:17,590
least it's never been our way but our ways can change
wouldn't you say we mustn't become mired in the olden ways

317
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:23,470
of doing things though i don't mean to pressure I get what's
yours is all.

318
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,690
Alright, here we go.

319
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,510
I think we can...

320
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,010
I think we can do this.

321
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,990
No need to fear it.

322
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:32,770
That's right.

323
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,210
We're gaming now.

324
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,350
We're in a game.

325
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,250
Alright, here we go.

326
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:41,950
We go up.

327
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,530
We just need one run.

328
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:45,970
Well, four runs.

329
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,710
But we can do this in four runs, guys.

330
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:55,510
all right so doki wants to reinstate the feud so in discord
between both families again you know who who's that like

331
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:05,810
that the goddess of discord thank you thank you guys look
it's a truce that means it can happen again it can start

332
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:14,410
whenever it's just a coincidence that when i mentioned it
maybe a feud started again thanks to your aid he's clearly

333
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:20,950
not the smartest one although Just a coincidence if the feud
restarts itself.

334
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,410
We want to attack.

335
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,090
Nice.

336
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,910
We got the Blitz right off the bat.

337
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,450
Whoa, that was fast.

338
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,390
That was actually really fast.

339
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,350
Yeah, early Blitz.

340
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,810
And it was a Blue Blitz too.

341
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,190
Oh.

342
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,620
Good.

343
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,580
Okay, started off strong.

344
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,140
I bet...

345
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,940
No, I don't have nectar.

346
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,500
Yeah, it'd be a shame if it was a little...

347
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:04,840
You know.

348
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,580
The sea spire stopped.

349
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:18,020
Their specials deal more damage, your cast inflicts hitch,
and immediately deals damage based on a flow and a binding

350
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,680
circle.

351
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:26,260

now zero commons but the more commons I have uh two?

353
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,880

359
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,440

360
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,460
Oh, there he is.

361
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,680
Excuse me, your parents are also gods and goddesses.

362
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,220
Oh, shit.

363
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,700
Okay, wait, I got...

364
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,040
This is not fair.

365
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,220
He's really kill-sitting.

366
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,640
It is not fair.

367
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,280

371
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,480
He's supposed to be a fair fighter.

372
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,660
He's literally Hercules.

373
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,780
He fights fair.

374
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,780
What happened to you, bro?

375
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,260
Ever since you...

376
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,680
Good.

377
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,280
Ever since you went to the surface world, bro.

378
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,140
Um, your hex makes everything else move slower.

379
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,540
Your hex launches.

380
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,140
Ugh.

381
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,360
All these are not the greatest.

382
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,610
Wait, that's not Hercules?

383
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,500
Uh, oh my god.

384
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,440
Have I not seen the A this entire time?

385
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,080
Wait, he's still half blood, right?

386
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,160
Oh, it was Hercules.

387
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,660
Okay.

388
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,320
Okay.

Sorry, you both...

391
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,640
At least...

392
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,260
Okay, he's still the same Hercules

393
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:07,850
All right, we'll grab three we'll grab them more He's still

him instead of bashing a bunch of weaklings far from where

I'm gonna change it to this side.

403
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,170
I feel like I'll hit more people if I do it this side.

404
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,130
Oh wait.

405
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,190

I didn't see these guys.

412
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,070
Good.

413
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,290

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,550
My frog would do it for free.

421
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,830
Um, your dash strike hits the edge.

422
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,390
Your area, your specials are 25% faster.

423
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:51,450
Oh.

424
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,630
Oh, they're all good, chat.

00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,830
All of them are actually really good.

426
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,810
I feel like three would be the best for my...

427
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,710
my build, right?

428
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,430

like it'd be the best.

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,540
Just, what the fuck?

431
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,020

Wait, can I make them join my army?

436
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,060
Oh, they don't want to join my army.

437
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,700

I guess I'll cry.

454
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,490
Any extra bonus room?

455
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,830
There's bonus money.

456
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:54,390
Yay!

457

Free money!

458
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,730
Free is free.

459
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,250
Uh, alright.

460
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,570
Alright, guys.

461
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,310
No more.

462
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:02,650
Oh, wait!

463
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,410
Birds!

464
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,470
See, I always put money in birds!

465
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:07,970
Yay!

466
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,030
Yay!

467
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,850
Alright, we have three more.

468
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,090
What's the plan, guys?

469
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:23,110
We have Hef, Zeus, Magic, Hera, Hef again, and Fire Lady.

470
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,790
I always forget Fire Lady's name.

471
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,410
You're a bird?

472
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,930
Yeah, but there can only be one bird.

473
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,530
I have the Birdopoly.

474
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,350
Zeus?

475
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,210
Alright, we'll get Zeus.

476
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,670
More Zeus, more power.

477
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,870
I like the sound of that.

478
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,750
I demand more power!

479
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,570
Okay.

480
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,030
Your power is always nice.

481
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,730
I keep forgetting to use cast.

482
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,750
There's just so many buttons to be aware of.

483
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,430
Too many buttons.

484
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:58,870
Okay, nice.

485
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,910
Oh, your cast costs.

486
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,730
Lightning bolts.

487
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,890
Anisha counter.

488
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,990
I feel like one, right?

489
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,930
One would be the best.

490
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,310
There's some coffee in my...

491
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,130
No, I don't need coffee right now.

492
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:14,790
I'm okay.

493
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,630
I feel okay.

494
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,150
I might need to get water soon, though.

495
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,590
Oh, I could rarefy.

496
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,890
I'll rarefy at one.

497
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,110
Alright, your cast cost land boss three.

498
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:28,890
Okay, there you go.

499
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,170
I just got a mummer to use cast.

500
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,170
It's crazy.

501
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,610
I have... Oh, wait.

502
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,490
There's food here, too.

503
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,190
When I have to use, like, three...

504
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,670
Guys, I have to click three buttons.

505
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,610
There's so many buttons, guys.

506
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,170
Three buttons is a lot of buttons.

507
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:45,890
Okay, nice.

508
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,090
Become sheep.

509
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:49,890
Nice.

510
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:50,470
All right.

511
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,790
What was the next option?

512
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:53,130
Hera?

513
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,890
All right, we'll grab Hera.

514
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,610
All right, they'll slowly come over here, right?

515
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,310
Nice.

516
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:08,470
Become sheep!

517
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:10,650
That's fucking right.

518
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,550
Oh wait, nice.

519
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,530
They got cursed too.

520
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,670
Where is the...

521
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,690
Oh, they don't have houses.

522
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,290
Alright, we'll just destroy this and then grab the free
money.

523
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,970
Because I assume they'll be dead by then.

524
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:22,830
Yeah!

525
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,510
Yes, I accept this message.

526
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,950

530
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,790
Oh, fuck.

531
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,610
Wait, born again.

532
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,110
Oh, but that's purple.

533
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,530
Fuck.

534
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,950
Born Gainer.

535
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,350
I feel like Born Gain, right?

536
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,270
ignore the Urpa.

537
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,630
But it's Urpa.

538
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,550
But guys, it's Urpa though.

539
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,730
Alright, let me go back.

540
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,250
No, it was more worth it.

541
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,630
No, you're right.

542
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,370
I guess you're right.

543
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,570
Alright, half last.

544
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,770
And it's convenient because you're next door.

545
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,890
Jesus Christ, that's a lot.

546
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,690
I'll make sure I don't accidentally touch fire because fire
bad.

547
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,490
I don't know if you guys know this, but fire is apparently
really bad.

548
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,410
I'm mining, mining.

549
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,130
I always have to learn the difficulties of fire.

550
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,010
Not even I get to do that much.

551
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:51,130

whole myth about heff was that he was so look this was what
they wrote okay they were like they were sort of like

553
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:05,330
ashamed of him but he was just so talented and inventing
they just isolated him into like this corner of the world so

554
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:13,850
they could just build stuff for the gods but then yeah okay

no longer ferry souls into the underworld, but it's become
quite valuable to the ongoing war effort.

575

591
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,310
seemed enormous.

592
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,290
Much bigger than most any other foe I'd ever faced for now.

593
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:51,810
Damn!

594
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:53,350
Melanie!

595
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,610
You just think he's weak as shit.

596
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,980
But back when first we met, my sleeping schedule was to be a
leader of work.

597
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,300
I'm thinking suckers?

598
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,240
And I've still got my money for the bird.

599
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,700
Bro, they had a drug.

600
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,380
You get a super chat, they can take each other.

601
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,260
Thank you for the super chat.

602
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:19,740

00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:25,920
Thank you He just wanted to sleep bro.

604
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:26,700
What's up?

605
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:36,580
She's just like bro you weak as fuck about everyone else
Bro, you're like a level you're like a level one crook I'll

606
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:45,880
have to take your word for it Anyways, just how big can he
be three square meals worth if I ever guess Been too long

607
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,480
since I had some monster meat

608
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,220
All right, I just got...

609
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,520
Can I turn him into sheep?

610
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:57,540
In Mune.

611
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,400
God damn it!

612
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,500
But doesn't he want to be a sheep, though?

613
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,180
Wouldn't he want to be a sheep?

614
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,280
God, what?

615
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,100
That hits me?

616
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Should I turn him into sheep real quick?

617
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:18,980
Okay.

618
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:20,600
Okay, okay.

619
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,740
The last push step.

620
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,600
Okay, okay.

621
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,780
Okay, the last rock, too, apparently.

622
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,520
The last everything.

623
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,700
Yeah, wouldn't you want that?

624
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:38,500
Oh, my God.

625
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,400
The dash didn't work for me for some reason.

626
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,060
Oh, my God.

627
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,440
The dash ain't working for me.

628
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,100
Okay, nice.

629
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,480
I forgot the timing of the dash because there's, like, a
cooldown for it.

630
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,060
Sorry, thank you, this is for chat.

631
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,060
Thank you, thank you.

632
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,600
Oh, he can even get a massage and everything.

633
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:09,820
If once this was a pasture and much livestock grazed and
roamed, now little evidence of this remains.

634
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,700
Wouldn't it be a dream for him to be turned into sheep?

635
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,160
He can finally live a peaceful sheep life.

636
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,780
He'll be one with his people.

637
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,520
Okay, I did lose like, majority of my HP, but it'll be okay.

638
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:26,740
Okay.

639
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:27,960
See?

640
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:28,640
Nice.

641
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,020
Nice.

642
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,200
See, I told you guys.

643
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,640
Uh, restore plus 20% health.

644
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,700
Oh, I didn't see this.

645
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,040
Turns one random common boon.

646
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,420
Gains plus 30% while I have at least one.

647
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:44,940
Okay.

648
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,500
We'll grab the concave stone for more boons.

649
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,320
Let's go, Freenos.

650
00:48:59,080 --> 00:48:59,480
Yeah.

651
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,440
All right.

652
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,740
On to the ship.

653
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:06,740
Ship time.

654
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,480
Ship time.

655
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,780
I would love to go on a cruise.

656
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,760
I've never been on a cruise.

657
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,600
I've been on a cruise once when I was like a kid.

658
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,060
To Alaska.

659
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,900
And I don't remember what happened.

660
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,720
I only remember the Alaska trip because my parents would
show photos.

661
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,640
Like, oh, remember the time you were in Alaska?

662
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,740
And I was like, I do not.

663
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,040
Then they'll be like, oh.

664
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,300
Oh, here's photos of it.

665
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,800
Uh, oh, wait, money.

666
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,900
Wait, can I unseal yet?

667
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:35,500
Breaking through.

668
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,380
I legitimately don't even remember what happened.

669
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:43,880
Okay.

670
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,760
Grab the ship.

671
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:47,620
This.

672
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,020
I do want to do a cruise one day in the future.

673
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,400
Yeah, I was like bored or some shit.

674
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,320
I don't fucking remember shit when I was four.

675
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:13,510
uh another appear and then appears most foes rain shots are
slower being dodged or two or three chat i mean minus 30

676
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,270
that's pretty good

677
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:29,060
i feel like i don't have enough money to do two do what like
with all the stuff they give me not the not the rain shots

678
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:38,920
early really adds up okay oh nice Oh my gosh, she gave it to
me so early, too.

679
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,240
This does not belong to you.

680
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,800
That's nice.

681
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,840
I got it so early as well.

682
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,740
I'll take those.

683
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,740
Oh my god, these already stole them.

684
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,900

685

687
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,220
$95 is $95.

688
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,260
I won the 50, 50, and 50.

689
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:04,780

693
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,480
You shall become sheep now!

694
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,680
It's actually so convenient.

695
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:21,520
Oh, hey.

696
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,040

00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,420
Oh, sheep!

700
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,160

00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,660
More HP.

705
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,760
More magic and HP.

706
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,780
Oh my god, what the fuck?

707
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,520
That guy did so much damage.

708
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,400
Holy shit, I was not expecting it.

709
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,560
That's a big-ass sheep, though.

710
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,900
What the fuck?

711
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:04,800
It's done.

712
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,660
Alright, more HP.

713
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,380
Holy shit, that was a giant-ass sheep that I turned.

714
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:16,900
What the...

715
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,460
What the doesn't stop him?

716
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,460
Oh, it's because he's armored.

717
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,860
Oh my god, I didn't see the armor.

718
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,720
Oh my god, I also did not see there was more sheep down
there.

719
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,260
Okay, oh, we'll go with Zeus.

720
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,440
Yeah, I was like charging it up, and I was so confused.

721
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,120
Okay, sheep.

722
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,600
Okay, that's good.

723
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,420
That's good that I turned the big guys, too.

724
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,280
I actually really need that.

725
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,600
Oh, I cursed all the big guys.

726
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,600
That's really good for me.

727
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,260
Okay, the sheep move.

728
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,520
The sheep move is really helping the boss.

729
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,400
Wait, Duel?

730
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,600

01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:32,300
Nice.

854
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:35,480
Okay, I can't afford it, but it's nice that it's there.

855
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:36,900
I can do that.

856
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,780
Our guardians, guardians are like the room bosses, right?

857
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:49,510
I should get that.

858
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:54,230
Are they like the final bosses for each location?

859
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:55,890
All right.

860
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,440
I will grab that.

861
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,360
Yeah.

862
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,050
It's last for it.

863
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:06,830
What's the end go?

864
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,290
Okay.

865
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,590
I wouldn't get the HP.

866
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:16,530
The HP sounds nice right now.

867
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:19,650
Oh, plus 10 foes?

868
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:21,950
Okay.

01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,050
Oh, no.

871
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,590
I should farm for the end.

872
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,800
It's not the best.

873
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,180
I guess I'll do this then.

874
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,540

It actually came in so clutch.

912
01:06:58,550 --> 01:06:59,610
The 400 damage.

913
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:02,890

01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,760
It's eagle tab.

924
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,160
Nice.

925
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:44,560
Sheep.

01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,540
Yeah, we cursed him.

927
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:49,840
There you go.

928
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,500
Uh, moon or...

929
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,080
Okay, moon.

930
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:53,960
Wait, let's talk here.

931
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,820
The majesty of Mount Olympus lies...

932
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:56,780
It's memory game now.

933
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:03,140
Underneath a heavy coat of snow, which masks the scars and
blemishes of a protracted siege.

934
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,060
Beautiful.

935
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,640
It's so beautiful.

936
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,880
Okay, I thought I was, like, in them right now.

937
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,360
Okay, nice.

938
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,760
What is he fighting?

939
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:17,820
Sheep!

940
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,040
Oh, nice.

941
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:19,660
Okay, that's good.

942
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,140
They turn, like, the one I really hate fighting.

943
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:23,840
That's actually really good.

944
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,420
That it turned these two.

945
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,880
Like, the worst ones.

946
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,000
With the goddamn snipers.

947
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:36,420
Nice.

948
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,300
I didn't actually have to deal with the snipers.

949
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,060
That's so good.

950
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,000
A trap is set.

951
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:43,540
Oh, my.

952
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:43,920
Oh!

953
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,220
Yeah, I got a crystal!

954
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,520
Let's go to crystal.

955
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:52,880
Um...

956
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,560
You remember if a blast deals 300?

957
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,560
I'm gonna try- I'm gonna- I'm gonna farm for this.

958
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:04,180
I'm gonna try for it.

959
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:07,720
Okay.

960
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,780
I'm gonna try for the end game.

961
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,120
Oh.

962
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,320
How much money?

963
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:18,420
199.

964
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:19,680
Oh, hey.

965
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,120
Oh, I didn't even see you.

966
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,520
No, it happened so fast.

967
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,520
Oh, yeah, it's only him.

968
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,840
How do you only have, like, one HP?

969
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,220
Bro, like, who fucking... Who fucked you up that fast?

970
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:40,900
Nice.

971
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:44,220
Yeah.

972
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,340
Oh, my god.

973
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,160
Nice.

974
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:51,880
Okay.

975
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:53,480
Any money?

976
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,400
Uh...

977
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,280
Alright, Hera.

978
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,760
When you have at least two?

979
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:04,480
Oh!

980
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,540
I do have at least two.

981
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,640
Stronger for each.

982
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,980
Your damaging effects from a stronger spoon, give or you
have.

983
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,460
Yeah.

984
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,500
How many comments do I have?

985
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,720
I don't know.

986
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:31,540
One, two, three, four, five, six?

987
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,690
One, two, three, four, five, six.

988
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,740
I guess I'll do that.

989
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,300
Yeah, I'm going to do three.

990
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,280
That was my boon.

991
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:56,210
Oh, my board game got rarefied.

992
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:56,850
Whoa!

993
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:01,310
What happened?

994
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:06,050
Why did it get super shiny?

995
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:11,590
Wait, what the fuck?

996
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,530
It just got super shiny there.

997
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:17,530
Alright.

998
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:22,550
Yeah, I booned a lot of stuff.

999
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:24,470
I don't even know what booned up.

1000
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:26,950
Which one it effect.

1001
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:29,430
I saw a lot of the names, and then I got confused.

1002
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:32,590
I'll invoke it now.

1003
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,440
Oh, shit!

1004
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,400
Zeus, why didn't you kill him?

1005
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,260
Okay, it's fine.

1006
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:45,820
We have sheep.

1007
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,420
We'll just curse them all.

1008
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,680
Oh, that's so helpful, especially against these guys.

1009
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,040
Oh, my God.

1010
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:57,740
I got another sheep.

1011
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,140
Thank God.

1012
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,180
That's so helpful again.

1013
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,180
for these guys.

1014
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:04,960
Nice.

1015
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:09,420
What the heck is my hammer?

1016
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,420
Wait, where did it...

1017
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:15,240
Oh, there it is.

1018
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:17,360
Oh!

1019
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,760
This cheap morph is actually so strong.

1020
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:24,760
Oh.

1021
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,760
That would be good for me.

1022
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,020
Yeah, my hex is putting in a lot of work.

1023
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,400
One, two, or three?

1024
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:40,300
Three, right?

1025
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:44,750
Two?

1026
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,160
I'll do two.

1027
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:53,680
Four.

1028
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,480
Okay, I'll do two.

1029
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:01,540
All right, talking time.

1030
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,100
Time to party!

1031
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,920
I didn't notice there was an entrance of nothing over here.

1032
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,600
I don't know, Dio.

1033
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:14,960
I'm ready to party.

1034
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,400
Any idea why this mountain has been shaking ceaselessly?

1035
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,540
Doubtless to the occasional dismay of your honored guests.

1036
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:23,980
Yes, I do.

1037
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,060
Sometimes the feasting gets a little rowdy.

1038
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,100
Oh, so it was him.

1039
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,520
With all the dancing and whatnot.

1040
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,200
Uncle Besides, not the only Earthshaker on Olympus.

1041
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:32,500
Nice.

1042
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,580
No, Typhon has awakened.

1043
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,180
The father of all monsters now threatens...

1044
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,280
Is that a drinker excited to see us?

1045
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,900
It's where he hides his second wine.

1046
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,400
His special wine.

1047
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:53,740
Yeah,

1048
01:13:58,060 --> 01:13:59,400
party till we die.

1049
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,320
Let's go.

1050
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,320
No worries.

1051
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,340
Let's see here.

1052
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,180
Your moves inflict hunger.

1053
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:07,660
Oh, wait.

1054
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,300
That's good.

1055
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,220
I'm going to restore it.

1056
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:09,780
We took damage.

1057
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,260
Oh.

1058
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,520
Wait, all of these are pretty good.

1059
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,360
One or two or three.

1060
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,580
Do you stack or omega or just grab HP?

1061
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,160
Encounter is like each room, right?

1062
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,320
Hmm.

1063
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:44,880
Oh.

1064
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,800
It's so hard to pick.

1065
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:55,280
Alright, one or two guys.

1066
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:56,660
you go?

1067
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,660
I will say two would be very useful.

1068
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:06,700
I'll go with two just because it'll be very useful for the
third, for the third place.

1069
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,540
The third area, the last, I'm sorry, the last area is where
I'm scared the most.

1070
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,100
I go with that.

1071
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,840
I'm really afraid of the, like the last area.

1072
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,320
I take the most damage in that area.

1073
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,680
What's the...

1074
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,040
I mean, we go magic.

1075
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,520
We can get more HP.

1076
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,080
Now, we'll get more boons.

1077
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,180
I think we have enough magic.

1078
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:38,620
Honestly.

1079
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,800
Oh, God.

1080
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:42,820
Oh, God.

1081
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,980
Wait, I can turn you into sheep?

1082
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,140
Oh, my God.

1083
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,160
It changes everything!

1084
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,940
That actually changes everything!

1085
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,800
Oh my god, I can turn him into sheep!

1086
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,240
Wait, that's so broken!

1087
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:04,460
Wait!

1088
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,160
That's right, you're not a real boss.

1089
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,920
In the name of Hades.

1090
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,720
That's crazy!

1091
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,500
I actually can turn him into a fucking sheep.

1092
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,040
Um...

1093
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,960
I guess we'll have to go to three.

1094
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,020
All of these fucking suck.

1095
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,170
Yeah, it's free damage.

1096
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:35,650
Alright, nice.

1097
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:36,310
Free magic.

1098
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:40,550
Oh, hey.

1099
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,090
Look at them stacking together.

1100
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:45,330
That's nice.

1101
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:46,950
Free stack.

1102
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,700
Yeah, sheep tap.

1103
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:55,580
Oh, my gosh.

1104
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,440
I should have saved this.

1105
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,180
have saved the sheep, though.

1106
01:16:59,000 --> 01:16:59,040
Honestly.

1107
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,340
I don't need to save it.

1108
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,780
Oh my god!

1109
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,060
Look at all these sheep!

1110
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,340
Yeah!

1111
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,140
Excellent timing.

1112
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,480
And more HP too.

1113
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:14,900
That's a lot of sheep.

1114
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,140
And we get Thina.

1115
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:24,460
After much consideration, I admit the best plan that I have
for stopping Typhon at this point is to rely on you.

1116
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:24,980
Yay!

1117
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:25,980
I'm reliable.

1118
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,120
would be most dire.

1119
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,360
So you guys, I am reliable.

1120
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,100
Lord Uncle Zeus alluded to some force that could potentially
defeat that monster, but bring great harm to Olympus in the

1121
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:36,540
process.

1122
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,400
Is that the alternative you mean?

1123
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,220
It is.

1124
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:44,760
My energies, as you can see, are focused on repelling our
enemy's forces here.

1125
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:49,440
But it seems I shall also have to dissuade my father from
taking a catastrophic course.

1126
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,780
If, but to buy you time, I'm counting on you.

1127
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:53,680
Yay!

1128
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,120
The whole world relies on me.

1129
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:56,700
Let's go.

1130
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,060
Oh, oh, Divine Dash!

1131
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:05,590
Right?

1132
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:06,510
That's the best one.

1133
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:07,770
Great, thank you for the super chat.

1134
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:08,050
Thank you.

1135
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,730
You know me, Big Poe?

1136
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:13,950
Which one?

1137
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:14,630
One or three?

1138
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:17,370
Or two?

1139
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,210
Divine Dash?

1140
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:24,470
Alright.

1141
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:25,670
Save choice.

1142
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:26,330
Yay!

1143
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:27,810
Wait.

1144
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,750
We'll go for shop because, like, I don't need nectar.

1145
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:33,350
Yeah.

1146
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:37,450
Her dialogue was literally a safe choice, guys.

1147
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:38,590
I don't think that's...

1148
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:38,910
Okay.

1149
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:41,230
I'm like, do I need a slam in?

1150
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:42,490
Oh, yeah, nice.

1151
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:43,070
There's money.

1152
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:47,050
Um, how much money do I have?

1153
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:48,290
Oh, I can afford everything.

1154
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:50,270
Buy this.

1155
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:51,690
On my authority.

1156
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:55,130
On.

1157
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,560
I'm just gonna get one.

1158
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:02,320
Uh, or two.

1159
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,180
One or two.

1160
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:21,880

barriers.

1163
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,560
Quick maps.

1164
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,880
Guys, maybe my math was too quick, guys.

1165
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:53,020
My math was too quick.

1166
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,860
Quick maps.

1167
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,500
Two or three, chat.

1168
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,760
Map, not math.

1169
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,840
My math's too quick.

1170
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:16,690
Three?

1171
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:17,250
Alright.

1172
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:18,830
Little spring in my step.

1173
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:21,990
Oh my god, look at all these statues.

1174
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:23,790
I'm gonna get money because I'm broke right now.

1175
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:28,230
And there's, because there's another shop and I do not have
money.

1176
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:34,770
Oh, so that's why they're destroying the statues.

1177
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:38,610
That makes sense.

1178
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:44,720
Sheep!

1179
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,300
That's right!

1180
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:49,340
You too.

1181
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,160
Oh my gosh.

1182
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,180
There you go.

1183
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:57,760
Is there any more?

1184
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,460
Oh my god, there's a lot more.

1185
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,440
I was like, guys, is there any more?

1186
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,880
That should be the last one, right?

1187
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,280
And then fucking everything shows up.

1188
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:12,840
Yeah, money.

1189
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:17,100
I'm gonna check if there's...

1190
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,960
Oh, there was more.

1191
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,020
More statues.

1192
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:19,720
I didn't even know this.

1193
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:29,960
that oh my god there's so many statues this is the last room
right 43 it's is it the last room or is it not the last room

1194
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:47,940
it is all right maybe a four one thing maybe oh yeah mystery
bag trust what you wanted right

1195
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,180
for seven seconds.

1196
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:58,940
If it was near after your dash, you can cause a blast that
deals, your weapon deals more damage based.

1197
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:01,520
I'm going to get two because I know.

1198
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:03,700
Okay, oh, wait.

1199
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:05,660
Oh, nine seconds.

1200
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,940
Okay, but I might need two because those, I take a lot of
that.

1201
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:11,520
Wait, really?

1202
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:11,900
What?

1203
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:12,700
Really?

1204
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:18,530
It's actually one better than two?

1205
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,150
Because I'm scared of the bird.

1206
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,750
That's what I, yeah.

1207
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:24,850
I'm scared of the bird.

1208
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:26,410
fucking bird!

1209
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,670
I'm gonna grab two because I know that bird!

1210
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:31,350
No.

1211
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:35,990
That, they send the bird out in the first three seconds and
that bird's gonna fucking beat the shit out of me.

1212
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:37,710
I was, I'm gonna grab the bird.

1213
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:42,530
That bird's gonna fucking beat me up and I'll grab magic so
I can get HP along the way.

1214
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:48,190
No, you don't understand, that bird will fucking beat up,
beat the shit out of me.

1215
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:05,080
Perhaps you're so called Master Kronos wants for you to fail
to suffer more than you already have that's right he seeks

1216
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:10,540
vengeance on the god why do you follow this guy you're just
gonna get beat up by me over and over again i'm literally

1217
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:18,820
the second bird i don't seek my master's forgiveness nor
assume his loyalty their alliances are born of shared goals

1218
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:27,120
perhaps ideals it's really bird on bird violence across
purposes because they punished you for crimes you knowingly

1219
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,540
committed what else could they have how is this 30 minutes.

1220
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,900
What the fuck is wrong with the surface world?

1221
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,000
I feel like I've speedrun held so fast.

1222
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:51,520
Oh, see guys, I told you.

1223
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,720
Look at, I told you.

1224
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,860
Look, it doesn't do nothing for me.

1225
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,380
Doesn't matter.

1226
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,220
I told you guys.

1227
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,860
I told you.

1228
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,560
We had to invest.

1229
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,920
Investment well made.

1230
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,020
That bird was fucked up.

1231
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:16,720
Okay, middle.

1232
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,520

Bird!

1234
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:35,580

There we go.

1244
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,300
That's fine.

1245
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,080
Oh my god.

1246
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:16,440
Come on.

1247
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,100
Let me send another one over.

1248
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:22,360
Okay.

1249
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,400
There we go.

1250
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:25,760
Oh!

1251
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,300
I lost a hundred, but it's okay.

1252
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,780
But you cannot afford to give chase.

1253
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,520
My strength shall return.

1254
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:33,680
There you go.

1255
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:36,080
Sheep is...

1256
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:36,840
I'm gonna go...

1257
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:37,540
I think sheep...

1258
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,920
Sheep is actually so funky shot.

1259
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,240
I gotta do sheep more.

1260
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:46,600
I think sheep has been the sheep move and the the minion
move that's been the strongest so far

1261
01:26:50,410 --> 01:27:04,550
all right yeah grab humans oh i'm full hp nice all right
death defiance time time to go to true hell yeah sheep has

1262
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:15,590

or some shit the fortress of the gods reels against the

1263
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:26,430
incomparable rage of typhon father of monsters giant of
storms who somehow lurks somewhere very nearby we'll find

1266
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:48,630
That's so good.

1267
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:51,090
That's actually so good for us.

1268
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:57,090
Oh, I forgot they don't give me shit and cheap as hell.

1269
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,730
These aliens don't have fucking shit.

1270
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:04,810
These aliens are so cheap.

1271
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:08,950
Oh my god, what am I looking at?

1272
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,470
We're looking at this giant ass sheep right now.

1273
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:16,990
Oh, this is hard.

1274
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:20,870
Three palms or Hera.

1275
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:22,230
Do we need any more?

1276
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:25,070
I mean, we're pretty maxed out.

1277
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:29,590
Hera or palms?

1278
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:31,230
Hera?

1279
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:34,030
What do we get from Hera that'll be good for us?

1280
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:35,390
Try.

1281
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:38,330
Oh my God!

1282
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:39,130
No!

1283
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:40,270
No!

1284
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:41,950
And he doesn't turn a sheep!

1285
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:48,570
He doesn't turn his sheep!

1286
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:56,380
Guys!

1287
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,820
I think that's the worst.

1288
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,000
What?

1289
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:03,640
Okay!

1290
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,440
Guys, I saw...

1291
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,020
I dashed you guys saw that.

1292
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,160
Okay.

1293
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,740
That should hit him, right?

1294
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:23,000
All right, that's fine.

1295
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,600
I'm a little scared of him.

1296
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,780
He doesn't turn to sheep.

1297
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:35,600
What?

1298
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,680
Oh my god.

1299
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:37,540
Okay, that sucks.

1300
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:38,840
Oh, fuck.

1301
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:43,840
Okay What the fuck is that range?

1302
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:52,790
Okay Actually, what the fuck was that range?

1303
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:59,230
Oh my god, he's anti-sheep.

1304
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:04,030
Oh!

1305
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:08,510
You're spreading these more damage when it does.

1306
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:10,230
Creates a fissure.

1307
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:14,070
Alright.

1308
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:15,730
Two?

1309
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:18,610
I am doing a lot of...

1310
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:20,410
Okay, casting.

1311
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:20,910
Okay.

1312
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,570
Oh, thank god.

1313
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:26,590
Yeah, I told that...

1314
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:28,310
I'm glad I did the deal thing.

1315
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:29,690
That thing was...

1316
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,350
There's actually a lightsaber right now.

1317
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:33,830
It's actually been, like, clutch.

1318
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:35,770
Oh my god.

1319
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:36,990
Why are you here?

1320
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:38,610
Why?

1321
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:41,490
Why are you here?

1322
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:46,750
Alright.

1323
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:50,730
Nice.

1324
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:52,230
Alright, we gotta go up.

1325
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:53,650
Closer to the top.

1326
01:30:57,950 --> 01:30:58,470
Nice.

1327
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:02,130
I can curse him right now.

1328
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,210
That's really good for me.

1329
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,230
Okay, nice.

1330
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:11,090
Turned back just in time, too.

1331
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:14,010
Alright, get in here.

1332
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:18,790
Oh my god, each run is taking me almost two hours.

1333
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:24,990
Oh, if I do moon beam, I can get my...

1334
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:26,550
I can get the power up.

1335
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:29,110
I don't need any heals anymore, but I can make a strong.

1336
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:29,810
stronger as sheep.

1337
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:33,670
More moon juice.

1338
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:35,490
Oh god.

1339
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:39,130
Okay, now I know how to fight him.

1340
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:41,230
Sheep!

1341
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:44,530
Oh my god, it doesn't.

1342
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:49,480
Sheep!

1343
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,900
Maybe I could Oh, I could turn the eye into sheep!

1344
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,260
Guys!

1345
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:56,920
The eyes can turn into sheep, guys!

1346
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,040
Wait, that's actually so good.

1347
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,760
I can actually turn...

1348
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,260
Oh, fuck.

1349
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,480
Okay, I deserve that.

1350
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:11,100
I can turn the eye and the sheep.

1351
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,720
We're so back.

1352
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:21,090
Monster Slay.

1353
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:22,350
That's so clutch.

1354
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:23,750
Should have stayed shut.

1355
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:27,090
Alright.

1356
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:29,710
I don't think I need this anymore.

1357
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:33,230
Just because, like, I have so much HP.

1358
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:38,590
I mean, maybe for the final boss?

1359
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:41,070
Let's see.

1360
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:44,690
X also charged up automatically.

1361
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:49,590
Maybe I'll grab this.

1362
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:50,330
And morph?

1363
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:53,150
Um, I mean, it's one point.

1364
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:54,950
I'll just grab it just for the sake of it.

1365
01:32:58,670 --> 01:32:59,630
And then...

1366
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:01,610
Um...

1367
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:10,530
I'll grab this.

1368
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:13,110
And then...

1369
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,000
Hmm...

1370
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:23,860
I'll grab this.

1371
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:26,380
So I can get overall damage.

1372
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:27,760
I got the shot.

1373
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:28,220
Nice.

1374
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:32,560
Yeah, I was gonna say...

1375
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,000
Oh, we're at the end.

1376
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:34,300
Okay.

1377
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:35,400
How about a resupply?

1378
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,160
I know.

1379
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,320
Of course we don't get Deftified.

1380
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,260
Fucking course.

1381
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,720
He's still plenty mad.

1382
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:45,060
Isn't there something your heck can do to make him maybe go
away for good?

1383
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:45,520
Yeah.

1384
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:49,360
I decide what.

1385
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:51,320
How many times do I need you on Taifan?

1386
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:52,340
Three, right?

1387
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,420
But it may take some time.

1388
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:57,780
Oh, great.

1389
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,440
Can't do things quick if they don't take some time.

1390
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:01,020
Well, then, don't let me keep you from your research.

1391
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:01,800
See you later, M.

1392
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,380
I'll buy the most expensive.

1393
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:07,560
I mean, if I buy this, I get...

1394
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:11,220
I mean, I could just buy hearts.

1395
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:13,520
Um...

1396
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,160
I'll buy the most...

1397
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:15,820
I'll buy hearts the most expensive.

1398
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:17,140
So...

1399
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:17,340

01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:22,140
Yeah.

1403
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:24,240

There we go.

1406
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:34,980
And then, for my calculations, I cannot afford both of
these.

1407
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:37,660
Okay.

1408
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:39,520

1420
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:53,320
I don't know if Heth can give me anything that's worth it.

1421

01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:37,570
in the beginning.

1440
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:39,090
Yes.

1441
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:42,630
Sheep!

01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:57,310
I don't understand.

1449
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,040
Okay.

1450
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:07,620

01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:08,300
It's bad.

1452
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,620
Sheep dive.

01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:17,700
That's bad.

1456
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:24,590
Okay.

1457
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:26,710

01:37:28,530 --> 01:37:29,450
Okay, I should actually do that.

1459
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:31,370
That's good.

1460
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:34,870
Sheep!

Yeah!

1462
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:38,830
That's quite enough, Typhon.

1463
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:42,610
Rick, thank you for the super chat.

01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:43,270
Thank you, thanks.

01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:46,050
Don't worry.

1466
01:37:46,410 --> 01:37:48,690

01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:17,390
Okay, I did not expect that Okay, I'm gonna wait until they
launch So this is how we have to the major It is how

1470
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:19,830
monsters are, but yeah, yeah, they turn in the sheep.

1471
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:20,830
That's right.

1472
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:29,520
Sheep time.

1473
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:33,580

01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:35,540
Okay, that's fine.

1475
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:38,100
That's, oh my god, that was not fine.

1476
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:43,800
I thought I was fine.

1477
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:45,020
Oh my god, sheep.

1478
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:49,580

1486
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:06,820
Oh, my.

1487
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,600

That was actually a god build that I had.

1495
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,200
I did not use a single death defiance for that build.

1496
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:34,500

typhon oh my god the sheep guys the gods starts to relent

1497
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:44,980
perhaps because its monstrous source is nowhere to be found
glory to the sheep at least for now oh two more two more for

1498
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:54,300
typhon like chronos is fine i think typhon was just hell
typhon is just it's just his finally it's just the arena i

1499
01:39:54,300 --> 01:40:03,360
hate that the arena for it the fact that had the sheep made
the last arena so easy for me dawn i did tell zagrius

1500
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:14,120
preparing guygaros may take a little while yeah that build
was really good the king and queen welcome back oh hey oh

1501
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:22,000
she's here too how my lord husband scoffed when first i
brought forth and perhaps this deadly witch niece of his

1502
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:29,140
raised from infancy to banquished time itself could also be
of benefit against the titan siege glad i won that out

1503
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:39,420
herodia of course we reached agreement on that matter else
my good niece would not be here now though tell us menui

1504
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:46,060
what news of a lasting solution to our predicament typhon
shows no interest in turning away maybe if you help out a

1505
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:55,020
little i don't know maybe cool you know would be better than
two gods fighting type bot maybe three and maybe four ah man

1506
01:40:55,020 --> 01:41:04,420
i'm crazy for thinking that though i know it's crazy we got
honor the 1v1 right though we have not achieved those means

1507
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:13,660
as yet you hear that soos the greatest inconveniences we
face may be resolved okay shot him with lightning what else

1508
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:24,720
do you want from it oh no shoot him with a second lightning
a thunder he has more than one lightning it's not like he's

1509
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,950
like one one per day

1510
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:43,840
please hold out as long as possible you're so greedy dokey
one way or another i'll be back as soon as i can kronos may

1511
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:52,340
have reawakened typhon but that same power could unravel him
May it be thus, we'd ask you take your time, my dear, but

1512
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:54,120
there's no telling how much we can spare.

1513
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:58,100
Nevertheless, tread carefully, and we shall be awaiting your
return.

1514
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:00,820
Don't you men catch, shoot lightning?

1515
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:03,200
We have a cool down.

1516
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:05,120
Oh yeah, the refractory period, right?

1517
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,680
He shot one lightning's got...

1518
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,360
Come back soon.

1519
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,260
God damn Zeus.

1520
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:15,120
Oh, flower, it's truly you.

1521
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,340
Forgive me, I... We must maintain decorum.

1522
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:19,980
Oh, Damir!

1523
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:24,420
Rather than within the dimness of a boon.

1524
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,580
Lady Demeter, the owner is mine.

1525
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:29,480
We're finally here!

1526
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:34,280
Everyone's preoccupied contending with the siege, and it
couldn't have been easy for you to be here now.

1527
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,520
That's why he comes back every hour.

1528
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:44,740
I was furious to have missed you when you visited before,
and was not about to let that reoccur.

1529
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:47,380
But you cannot stay, can you?

1530
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:52,780
I have to go back downstairs and do it all over again.

1531
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:56,240
Bro, each run takes, like, almost two hours.

1532
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,760
Jesus Christ, I fought.

1533
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:04,640
Alright, before we talk to Apollo, I'm going to get water.

1534
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,760
I'm running out of water.

1535
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:06,680
I'll be right back, guys.

1536
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:12,160
With the weavings of the face.

1537
01:43:26,350 --> 01:43:33,030
The sun shall rise and dawn will break.

1538
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:43,770
Our fated glory ours to take, though perils come to test our
will.

1539
01:43:44,450 --> 01:43:55,430
Our noble home is standing still, weathering all storms with
fire.

1540
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:06,830
From highest peak to the deepest seas below.

1541
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:16,230
We tend the weak so that mortal lives may grow.

1542
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:37,130
Bleeding flowers in the springtime, Craning to feel the
morning light The sun shall rise and dawn will break Our

1543
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:52,920
fated glories to take Though perils come to attest our
willful home Is standing still

last we spoke no true ending will take too long I don't

1554
01:46:53,930 --> 01:47:01,570

something about the name Prometheus oh what it meant

1555
01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:10,190
something to me huh but Prometheus was a imprisoned for eons
prior to this point yeah if you remember him how do you

1556
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:18,510
remember him back I'd be ancient history but I hardly
remember yesterday don't know how come I'd remember

1557
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:28,930
something from that long ago I mean she knows Prometheus
remember anything from men except except what oh yeah just a

1558
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:41,640
feeling but it isn't great except what to victory The
prophecy concerning Typhon's reawakening.

1559
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:43,760
What made you think it would never come to pass?

1560
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:47,060
I thought the weavings of your sisters were always certain
to come true.

1561
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:51,100
The fates are not always straightforward.

1562
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:55,320
Their prophecies are represented visually, not written in
detail.

1563
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:56,960
At least the major ones.

1564
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,400
I thought my interpretation of Typhon's return was likely
misguided.

1565
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:07,940
So the fates wove the image of some terrible monstrosity
climbing Olympus and the other one?

1566
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:16,680
the gods were all desperately trying to fight back and you
thought it meant what well it wasn't that exactly though I

1567
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:22,680
didn't take it quite as literally as I should have in
hindsight I thought it prophesied that the Olympians would

1568
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:29,660
have to stand against some sort of existential threat well
you weren't wrong

1569
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:44,810
when the fuck do I get my free nectar I built this bar
because I assume I get free shit Excuse me?

1570
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:48,230
All I get are a bunch of free loaders.

1571
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:52,550
All right.

1572
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,800
It said it gave me free nectar.

1573
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:01,000
Also, what can I give to you?

1574
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:02,500
Oh, fishing?

1575
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,600
Who do I fish with?

1576
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:05,880
I'm not fishing with Aris.

1577
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:09,680
They're saying you beat Typhon single-handedly last night.

1578
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:12,820
One step closer to putting everything back to the community.

1579
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:15,320
I am.

1580
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:21,740
the community i did not beat typhon single-handedly but we
managed to defeat him yes though i don't think you need to

1581
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:29,160
fear a return to normalcy anytime soon i know you're trying
to reassure me but i can't help the way i feel i ought to be

1582
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:35,700
enjoying all this while it lasts the future might be boring
as dirt but right now things are okay what do you mean

1583
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:46,460
things are okay people are dying things are not okay my
entire family is kidnapped what the do you mean things are

1584
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:52,820
okay typhon does not belong in this world yeah

1585
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:03,750
i don't think there's anything i want to find for right now

1586
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:21,610
uh and choppy okay we now got the disintegration of wait are
you fucking okay

1587
01:50:24,830 --> 01:50:38,370
okay oh we have eight okay that's good all right oh wait one
more run one more run oh my god wait what is better than two

1588
01:50:38,370 --> 01:50:50,090
if you don't overcome such hardships to reach that one is
better than two the palace grounds were like nothing I've

1589
01:50:50,090 --> 01:51:00,210
ever beheld though everything was so vivid I scarce could
see at all oh that for an incantation oh hope is a lie oh my

1590
01:51:00,210 --> 01:51:04,230
god that you do not never mind do more

1591
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:19,150
hope is a lie never have hope i'd hope for like nearly two
seconds and it was a mistake

1592
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:32,360
how was the surface still warm and welcoming i reckon You're
to be commended for even setting foot up there.

1593
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,020
It was dreadful.

1594
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,940
The city of Afera is completely overrun.

1595
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:42,640
And there's a blind cyclops making sure no one gets out.

1596
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:44,540
Nah.

1597
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:47,080
Well, that all sounds entirely unfortunate.

1598
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,260
That blind cyclops must be Polyphemus.

1599
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,880
My crew and I once had a bad run in with him.

1600
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,820
He's still going on about eating people.

1601
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,320
I mean, what else does he have to do?

1602
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:12,940
night he is he's like oh okay that's pretty gross chad's

Okay.

Wait, can I cancel my order?

1610

Guys, I've been farming it all.

1612
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,380
I farmed too much psyche.

1613
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,040
Now I don't know what to do.

1614
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:57,040
I didn't realize 30 was the fucking max.

1615

Alright, now I have a thousand psyche because I accidentally
farm too much um what do i want okay location rewards i'll

1642
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:52,080
alone commander we have olympus on our side and more Oh,

1643
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:53,660
Um, yeah, that's what I said.

1644
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:55,520
Technically, it wasn't just you.

1645
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:56,420
Hear that, disciples?

1646
01:55:56,940 --> 01:55:59,760
She had a bunch of those fancy boons and who only knows what
else?

1647
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:03,840
Then you win the wager?

1648
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,260
Damn right.

1649
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:09,620
God, I'm so humble.

1650
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:11,400
So humble.

1651
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:14,900
Whichever way I choose, I can prevail.

1652
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:17,060
But where to focus next?

1653
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:21,400
That's me.

1654
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:23,620
All right, up we go.

1655
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:25,400
Run number two.

1656
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:31,980
Hold on, everyone.

1657
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:35,360
All right, here we go.

1658
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,380
You are truly one of us, Malinui.

1659
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,600
I saw how mightily you fought my own eyes.

1660
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,860
Even in the face of Typhon's savagery, your father surely
would have been as proud as I.

1661
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:48,380
All right.

1662
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:51,880
You're special in Flix Blitz.

1663
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:54,960
Special, right?

1664
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:56,400
Oh, I could rarify it, too.

1665
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:01,260
Can I do special, chat?

1666
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,320
Yeah, I'm gonna rarify it.

1667
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:06,760
Ooh!

1668
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:08,500
Dancy!

1669
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:11,260
Oh, I got chaos, too!

1670
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:13,740
That's always good.

1671
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:17,120
Nice.

1672
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:18,360
I have chaos for it.

1673
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:21,160
But I think we have fishing here.

1674
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:23,000
Yeah, it's fishing time.

1675
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,060
The hunt begins.

1676
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:26,940
I just realized the last run, we didn't even get any chaos.

1677
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:32,400
Let's go get chaos real quick.

1678
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:33,420
Yeah, early chaos.

1679
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:34,600
It's always nice.

1680
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:47,410
The earth itself shuddered as though an object of very
substantial size held from considerable height.

1681
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:49,830
That must have been the being you called Typhon.

1682
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:51,550
You chew coffee tall.

1683
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:52,230
That's me.

1684
01:57:53,930 --> 01:57:54,770
Not good.

1685
01:57:55,050 --> 01:57:56,070
Not like other gods.

1686
01:57:56,790 --> 01:58:03,600
I mean, after it's...

1687
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:05,820
You're stunned.

1688
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:07,600
Oh, that is so dangerous.

1689
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:12,280
Oh, I have two or three.

1690
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,360
I feel like three.

1691
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,740
So I don't have to worry about magic for a while.

1692
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:21,080
If I don't get born gain, I don't have to worry too much.

1693
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:22,960
Just don't get take.

1694
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:24,360
I feel like, I don't know.

1695
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:26,880
Three.

1696
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:35,640
and then just hope that I don't get like it's just for
precaution I don't get boring again all right my kids you

1697
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:45,820

moon oh my god I think they saw my moon running was like

1699
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:56,860
never not again for her

1700
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:13,550
Oh my god, they actually like The most outrageous bit of
hearsay Oh, Medea I think lately on the winds about what

1701
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:18,490
ails the mountain of the gods You've been heading that way
What's going on?

1702
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:25,110
Things are alright I think If the hearsay concerned an
ancient and enormous monster Everything's alright Assuming

1703
01:59:25,110 --> 01:59:33,870
the Titans legions don't achieve it first It's not hearsay
Oh my Then I know which monstrosity you mean and you intend

1704
01:59:33,870 --> 01:59:42,490
to challenge him and all the rest you're entirely mad
sorceress but so is the world over i mean you could help i

1705
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:48,070

02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:16,450
Okay, and then we'll grab Hammer.

Oh my god, I can't...

1710
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:22,610
The thing is, I can't charge it.

1711
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:25,290
If we're lucky...

1712
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:33,680
It's so weird not using my charge move after I've been using
charge for so long.

1713
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:37,240
I'm trying so hard not to charge my moves up right now.

1714
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:47,080

I'm just gonna activate this just because I don't have...

1721
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:01,000
God, that was such a good build, man.

1722
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:02,180
That was...

1723
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:04,380
I had, like, everything I need, too.

1724
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:06,860
That really was such a good build.

1725
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:08,920
I'm so sad.

1726
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:12,940
Whoa.

1727
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:16,200
I'll get rid of these guys.

1728
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:21,860
Oh my god, it takes fucking forever!

1729
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:28,400
I know it doesn't matter.

1730
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:30,360
I'm just gonna kill him just for the sake of it.

1731
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:34,160
It's so slow.

1732
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:38,500
God, I wish I had my sheep.

1733
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:41,180
I missed the sheep.

1734
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:43,920
Transform him.

1735
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:45,240
Okay, more HP, that's fine.

1736
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:47,080
I mean, more HP is always good.

1737
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:51,700
God.

1738
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:55,920
I missed what I had.

1739
02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:01,360
It truly was the best build that ever was.

1740
02:03:05,950 --> 02:03:06,330
Okay.

1741
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:07,710
Guess I got more magic.

1742
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:10,670
Oh.

1743
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:14,810
All right.

1744
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:16,110
Who do we have left?

1745
02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:17,430
We got three left.

1746
02:03:18,010 --> 02:03:18,550
We have.

1747
02:03:19,890 --> 02:03:22,550
Hermes, Heth, Zeus, Apollo.

1748
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:23,950
Aphrodite.

1749
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:26,090
I guess for a hef, right?

1750
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:27,030
Pray for a good hef?

1751
02:03:30,330 --> 02:03:31,250
I'll go for a hef.

1752
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:34,170
Maybe I'll get the magic gamba.

1753
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:41,760
Okay.

1754
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:44,140
It's just a house.

1755
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:45,100
It should be fine.

1756
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,540
I gotta grab the other house.

1757
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,100
It's fine.

1758
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:55,140
Jesus.

1759
02:03:55,620 --> 02:03:56,420
I'm so not using.

1760
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:59,860
Just taking 20 years to kill one guy.

1761
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:04,840
Let's have one more.

1762
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:06,420
One more chaos.

1763
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:09,040
Welcome to the fine city of Afera, witchy.

1764
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:12,260
The most important thing to know is whatever happens to you
there.

1765
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,840
I cannot be held liable.

1766
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:16,020
I work weapons, not miracles.

1767
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:18,660
So, man, thank you for the super chat.

1768
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:19,540
Thank you.

1769
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:20,280
I don't remember that.

1770
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:20,840
Yes!

1771
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:21,700
Yes!

1772
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:24,820
Oh my god, we got three.

1773
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:27,360
I didn't even bother to read the other two.

1774
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:28,920
other two were not as good.

1775
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:34,020
I hope the other two was not as good.

1776
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:35,200
I didn't even read it.

1777
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:37,220
I was like, oh my god, there it is.

1778
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:40,140
We actually got our gamba.

1779
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:41,700
The gamba.

1780
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:47,460
We're... I hope the god I didn't miss out on some good-ass
shit.

1781
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:49,140
All right, Zeus, right?

1782
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:50,220
We'll go for Zeus.

1783
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:57,560
Okay, that should be... This should be the last encounter,
too.

1784
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:59,360
Which is always good.

1785
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,160
Okay, where's the last guy?

1786
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:08,980
Oh my god, the goddamn house.

1787
02:05:11,020 --> 02:05:13,000
No affordable housing for you guys.

1788
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:13,800
Jesus Christ.

1789
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:15,720
You heard it.

1790
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:19,840
Is my Oshi evil?

1791
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:22,460
Oh, fuck.

1792
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:26,420
Good now for you.

1793
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:27,920
Nice, there you go.

1794
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:31,880

02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:34,200
Okay Wait, we gotta destroy this house.

1801
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:35,240
Oh, wait, we don't need to.

1802
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:36,140
It's already down

1803
02:06:40,890 --> 02:06:43,210
Jesus Christ, oh my god

1804
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:49,220
Yeah, they got through

1805
02:06:56,920 --> 02:07:03,360
Yeah, the building is not up to code Access you're getting
close to a breakthrough there with grants and typhoon and

1806
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:03,600
whatnot.

1807
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:06,720
I don't want to rush you in but this is me help myself
sometimes.

1808
02:07:10,180 --> 02:07:10,300
Alright.

1809
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,920
Oh my god, even...

1810
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:12,660
Wait, I can...

1811
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:12,780
Wait.

1812
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:14,520
Attack, special, and cast.

1813
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:15,040
Okay, wait.

1814
02:07:15,980 --> 02:07:17,240
Oh, is it just...

1815
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:17,860
Oh, never mind.

1816
02:07:19,540 --> 02:07:21,460
Wait, I could be even faster.

1817
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:22,300
Wait.

1818
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:24,940
I could be so fucking fast now.

1819
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:28,140
It's all speed.

1820
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:32,260
Speed for days.

1821
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:34,960
Finished here.

1822
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:37,240
Okay, let's grab...

1823
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:38,520
You know, let's then go in.

1824
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:40,920
We're actually speed for days now.

1825
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,540
We're speeding legally.

1826
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:44,580
150.

1827
02:07:47,220 --> 02:07:47,720
Yeah.

1828
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,600
Oh, I'm so poor, though.

1829
02:07:50,660 --> 02:07:54,860
You're a trusted boatman, compared with having to drag our
boons all the way into the underworld.

1830
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:57,580
Although, he probably prefers it there.

1831
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:02,540
Oh, my...

1832
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:03,960
Okay, wait, I don't think we need gain.

1833
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,540
I'm not gonna lie.

1834
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:10,440
I legitimately don't think we need gain though.

1835
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,040
Like, we have so much.

1836
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:17,680
I would be honest with you guys.

1837
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:24,260
Yeah, I think we'll deal with one.

1838
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:29,320
Like, I think we're fine in the mana.

1839
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,300
Yes, you be.

1840
02:08:37,810 --> 02:08:40,770
But instead, you spit my eye.

1841
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:43,310
Wait, you don't have an eye, though.

1842
02:08:45,470 --> 02:08:46,690
I have done no such.

1843
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:50,170
I mean, we could still be friends.

1844
02:08:50,590 --> 02:08:51,270
Maybe you would.

1845
02:08:53,290 --> 02:08:55,030
Put yourself in my sandals.

1846
02:08:55,190 --> 02:08:56,050
What do you mean spin your eye?

1847
02:08:56,150 --> 02:08:57,530
You don't even have your eye anymore.

1848
02:08:57,690 --> 02:08:58,150
Yeah, what eye?

1849
02:08:58,330 --> 02:09:00,010
I don't like the way you're treating me.

1850
02:09:00,330 --> 02:09:02,310
I am gonna eat you.

1851
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:07,040
Okay.

1852
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:09,120
What?

1853
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:10,320
What

1854
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:15,830
the fuck hit me?

1855
02:09:20,230 --> 02:09:21,110
Nice try.

1856
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:22,470
Okay.

1857
02:09:22,530 --> 02:09:23,830
Let's shake things up.

1858
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:27,070
Okay, that's illegal.

1859
02:09:30,450 --> 02:09:31,870
Shut up, put it here.

1860
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:33,670
Just because I have so much.

1861
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:38,390
I think it's almost done anyway.

1862
02:09:40,670 --> 02:09:41,630
Oh my god!

1863
02:09:41,970 --> 02:09:42,430
That's fine.

1864
02:09:43,950 --> 02:09:46,690
Oh, yeah, there's a black sheep over there.

1865
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:49,110
What?

1866
02:09:51,170 --> 02:09:52,150
Oh my god!

1867
02:09:52,210 --> 02:09:52,790
Oh my god!

1868
02:09:52,850 --> 02:09:53,430
Oh my god!

1869
02:09:53,570 --> 02:09:54,390
Okay, this is...

1870
02:09:54,410 --> 02:09:55,430
This is not looking...

1871
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:58,090
I'm, like, literally getting hit by everything possible.

1872
02:10:01,810 --> 02:10:03,150
I don't know how he's doing it.

1873
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:05,350
He's just standing there menacingly.

1874
02:10:09,150 --> 02:10:10,110
Jesus Christ.

1875
02:10:14,420 --> 02:10:15,140
Okay, it's fine.

1876
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:18,740
I don't know how he's doing it.

1877
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,380
He's literally just standing there.

1878
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:22,980
There we go.

1879
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:29,300
Everything's okay.

1880
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:30,560
Don't stand in my way.

1881
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:31,780
We're fine.

1882
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:34,620
Just 100 HP gone.

1883
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:35,540
But we're fine.

1884
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:38,920
She's just standing there.

1885
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:44,790
Drink some water.

1886
02:10:44,890 --> 02:10:45,330
See, look at that.

1887
02:10:45,450 --> 02:10:46,750
It's like we didn't lose HP.

1888
02:10:51,230 --> 02:10:52,190
Conkief's done.

1889
02:10:53,770 --> 02:10:56,910
I mean, is there anything that should really would be good?

1890
02:10:58,630 --> 02:10:59,430
I know you conkief.

1891
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:02,590
If it works, it works.

1892
02:11:03,150 --> 02:11:03,950
Don't need to change it.

1893
02:11:04,410 --> 02:11:06,590
Don't need to change anything if it's been working.

1894
02:11:09,870 --> 02:11:10,870
What's the...

1895
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:12,470
What's the saying, guys?

1896
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:15,730
If they broke, don't fix it.

1897
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:23,650
On the outskirts of the city lies a makeshift to dock from
which a vessel may come through the channel across the land

1898
02:11:23,650 --> 02:11:25,810
toward the mountain of the gods.

1899
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:29,090
Looks like I'll need a ride.

1900
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:31,210
All right, time to go on the boat.

1901
02:11:31,630 --> 02:11:32,230
Boat time.

1902
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:39,120
Okay, I definitely do not need to do that.

1903
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:41,020
Okay.

1904
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:45,520
Oh, I just need a casting.

1905
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:50,500
We'll grab Ash.

1906
02:11:58,630 --> 02:11:58,730
Okay.

1907
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:03,910
Okay, we'll grab this here.

1908
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:05,910
There's the last guy.

1909
02:12:05,950 --> 02:12:06,350
Oh, there he is.

1910
02:12:06,450 --> 02:12:07,210
He's so tiny.

1911
02:12:07,350 --> 02:12:08,290
I couldn't see him.

1912
02:12:10,950 --> 02:12:14,810

1913
02:12:18,290 --> 02:12:38,310
I'm not very happy with my court what okay whoops it's okay

02:12:38,310 --> 02:12:44,570

okay I got stuck but It's okay.

1915
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:45,770
Nothing to worry about.

1916
02:12:45,990 --> 02:12:47,450
Are you fucking kidding me?

1917
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:53,850
I keep thinking I can dash like for the rest of my life.

1918
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:55,790
Time for a tune up.

1919
02:12:56,890 --> 02:12:58,110
I need a moon.

1920
02:12:58,330 --> 02:12:59,790
I haven't got a moon yet.

1921
02:13:00,870 --> 02:13:01,550
I have three.

1922
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:04,910
Huh?

1923
02:13:14,190 --> 02:13:14,610
Three?

1924
02:13:15,150 --> 02:13:16,090
I have three Earth.

1925
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:19,010
Oh, but it's not for Omega though.

1926
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:22,710
I guess one then, right?

1927
02:13:25,750 --> 02:13:27,530
Yeah, because it's not for the cast.

1928
02:13:27,670 --> 02:13:28,530
It's just for normal.

1929
02:13:30,650 --> 02:13:32,610
I just need the fucking moon.

1930
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:34,430
Yeah, I'll go one then.

1931
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:36,090
Oh, there you go.

1932
02:13:37,610 --> 02:13:38,690
I'm just like, oh, you need me?

1933
02:13:38,850 --> 02:13:39,050
Okay.

1934
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:43,770
I mean, that's good that she listened, you know?

1935
02:13:45,050 --> 02:13:46,310
I'm glad she...

1936
02:13:46,890 --> 02:13:48,370
You know, I'm glad she cares.

1937
02:13:51,730 --> 02:13:52,250
Nice.

1938
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:55,990
She the goat.

1939
02:13:56,230 --> 02:14:01,750
Thy now, that monster Typhon must remember the bitter taste
of defeat, yet he does not relent.

1940
02:14:02,570 --> 02:14:07,310
Thus he has left us with no choice but to pursue the means
of his annihilation, little star.

1941
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:11,150
Behold my light.

1942
02:14:12,970 --> 02:14:14,230
Oh my god.

1943
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:15,290
Again!

1944
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:16,250
Sheep time!

1945
02:14:17,990 --> 02:14:18,930
Sheep time!

1946
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:20,270
Sheep is back!

1947
02:14:21,890 --> 02:14:27,610
Oh fuck okay, I don't think I could turn the tentacles into
sheep Okay, this guy is actually so annoying.

1948
02:14:27,730 --> 02:14:29,830
I don't like this guy for the boss, but

1949
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:43,540
Okay All right, there we go What?

1950
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:45,740
Does he turn into sheep?

1951
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:47,080
Wait, he turns into sheep!

1952
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:48,780
He turns into sheep!

1953
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:52,220
Guys!

1954
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:55,680
He turns into sheep!

1955
02:14:58,600 --> 02:14:59,800
Good news!

1956
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:06,340
Oh my god.

1957
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:08,240
He turns in a sheep.

1958
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:14,020
That's actually the best news I've heard.

1959
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:17,080
How?

1960
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:22,280
Okay, I have to, like, dodge everything there.

1961
02:15:26,670 --> 02:15:28,090
Oh my god, he fucking kidding me.

1962
02:15:28,390 --> 02:15:29,930
Oh my...

1963
02:15:29,930 --> 02:15:30,550
Sheep tag.

1964
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:33,810
Oh, my God.

1965
02:15:34,810 --> 02:15:37,230
It truly is the luckiest day right now.

1966
02:15:39,390 --> 02:15:41,050
He, in fact, turns in a sheep.

1967
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:45,440
Oh.

1968
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:48,780
Good news, everyone.

1969
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:51,400
Good news.

1970
02:15:52,180 --> 02:15:53,460
I accept this message.

1971
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:54,960
Oh, hey.

1972
02:15:57,980 --> 02:15:59,020
Good job.

1973
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,720
I'll miss you on more damage based on...

1974
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:03,460
All right, one or three.

1975
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:14,840

02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:33,120
oh my god the sheep run to the next vessel the fucking oh my
god i if i knew the sheep was so strong at the beginning oh

1977
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:46,260

too good to be true i should have used i should have used

1978
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:47,760

02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:17,060
Yay tree!

1982
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:18,140
Big damn!

1983
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:23,960
How regrettable to know Prometheus rebels against the gods.

1984
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:28,480
Surely he must see that his pursuit of vengeance shall not
bring him any peace.

1985
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:31,360
Is there no reasoning with him?

1986
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:35,360
He isn't much for talk, but then lately who is?

1987
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:37,660
We end up clashing just beneath the summit.

1988
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:40,820
Apparently he always knows who's going to be the victor.

1989
02:17:41,620 --> 02:17:50,900
even if it's me he does what he's cheating oh he's foreseen
his own defeat before can you imagine poppet to know of each

1990
02:17:50,900 --> 02:18:01,700
and every hill awaiting why would you keep fighting if you
know you're gonna lose keep your clean record all right oh

1991
02:18:13,410 --> 02:18:16,090
oh yeah i'm bower hacks guys

1992
02:18:20,730 --> 02:18:25,890
We Gamba in Yard of Gamba, bro isn't a sellout.

1993
02:18:27,210 --> 02:18:29,090
Bro, why does he just rig the match, you know?

1994
02:18:29,190 --> 02:18:32,150
Just like how Jake Paul earned, like, like what?

1995
02:18:32,830 --> 02:18:33,970
Six million dollars?

1996
02:18:34,170 --> 02:18:34,630
I think it was more.

1997
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:35,890
Six million dollars per round.

1998
02:18:36,970 --> 02:18:37,750
Gamba time.

1999
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:38,570
All right, what did I get?

2000
02:18:40,470 --> 02:18:41,790
Divinity and what?

2001
02:18:46,190 --> 02:18:46,650
Okay.

2002
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:48,310
What else did I get?

2003
02:18:50,630 --> 02:18:52,050
What was my first one?

2004
02:19:02,970 --> 02:19:03,630

Alright, uh...

2009
02:19:42,890 --> 02:19:46,150
More magic means...

2010
02:19:47,670 --> 02:19:48,170
More HP.

2011
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:50,130
I'm greedy.

2012
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:53,390
Oh, I should have saved my sheep, actually.

2013
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:56,330
Maybe I should have saved my sheep.

2014
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:01,480
I mean...

2015
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:02,060
What the fuck?

2016
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:02,800
He's still alive?

2017
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:04,080
He's still alive.

2018
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:05,400
Sheep time.

2019
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:06,480
Wait, where are you?

2020
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:06,820
Yeah.

2021
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:09,260
God, you could hide from me?

2022
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:10,980
Oh, shit.

2023
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:11,620
Never mind.

2024
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:13,040
Apparently, you can't.

2025
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:14,420
Oh, my God.

2026
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:15,000
Never mind.

2027
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,120
Oh, my God.

2028
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:20,860
Yes, you can hide from me.

2029
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:22,020
Sheep.

2030
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:24,120
Oh, that's a lot of sheep.

2031
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:31,560
Sheep.

2032
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:33,400
Oh, shit.

2033
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:36,980
Nice.

2034
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,660
I'll grab my magic first.

2035
02:20:41,820 --> 02:20:42,120
Whoa.

2036
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:42,500
Cool.

2037
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:45,920
The other night, I thought I saw you launch yourself towards
the Olympus Summon.

2038
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,100
Right into that awful storm.

2039
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:50,100
I couldn't even get close.

2040
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:53,120
What was it like up there?

2041
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:55,540
Oh, it was awful.

2042
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:58,180
I normally like rain, but not like that.

2043
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:04,620
Typhon is drawn to the fortress of the gods, as it's the
last defense before the palace of Zeus, likely his real

2044
02:21:04,620 --> 02:21:04,940
goal.

2045
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:12,220
So the gods keep knocking him down, but he keeps getting
back up, trying over and over to accomplish the same thing.

2046
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:22,440
a battle of wills battle of wits would have been easier, I
guess alright with these oh, do I have attack wounds?

2047
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:29,420
That's pretty early I feel like three, right?

2048
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:38,020
Not, seven encounters is a lot of encounters, but I think
that's fine how many attack wounds do I even have?

2049
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:39,220
Three is not worth it?

2050
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:45,540
Five more five more Two or three?

2051
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:49,940
Seven is a lot.

2052
02:21:50,260 --> 02:21:50,720
I guess.

2053
02:21:51,740 --> 02:21:53,080
Alright, I'll do two then.

2054
02:21:55,360 --> 02:21:55,440
Alright.

2055
02:22:06,510 --> 02:22:07,270
Wait, three?

2056
02:22:07,950 --> 02:22:09,190
Two or three, guys.

2057
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:10,590
It's 50-50.

2058
02:22:11,650 --> 02:22:13,430
I don't have free will!

2059
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:17,530
Two or three!

2060
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:19,850
Two or three?

2061
02:22:22,450 --> 02:22:23,910
Again, but don't get...

2062
02:22:28,910 --> 02:22:29,430
Two!

2063
02:22:32,530 --> 02:22:32,690
Okay.

2064
02:22:33,990 --> 02:22:34,570
I got two.

2065
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:35,870
Wait, what did it upgrade?

2066
02:22:36,770 --> 02:22:37,010
Bye.

2067
02:22:37,510 --> 02:22:39,490
I don't even know what it went up.

2068
02:22:43,670 --> 02:22:45,330
Wait, what did it...

2069
02:22:47,090 --> 02:22:49,170
I only had one attack bond.

2070
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:51,550
Okay.

2071
02:22:52,090 --> 02:22:52,550
That's fine.

2072
02:22:53,990 --> 02:23:04,910
all right next vessel oh there it is yeah the only one with
numbers on it the front of the fleet guys i might have maybe

2073
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:06,410
free will was a mistake

2074
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:33,100
i mean another pride won't be so bad guys or three do i take

Oh, okay.

2077
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:36,380
Two or three.

2078
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:37,700
Or one.

2079
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:45,250
I mean...

2080
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:48,280
I'm crazy.

2081
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:49,900
Oh, yay!

2082
02:23:51,740 --> 02:23:53,040
Two of you are crazy.

2083
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:54,040
Enough said.

2084
02:23:58,680 --> 02:23:59,840
All right.

2085
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:02,800
Palm or health chat.

2086
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:12,640

crazy

2087

fight Ares Alright, let's fight Ares This is a little hardy.

2089
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:46,940
Just about everybody on Olympus giving you their best.

2090
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:49,640
I do need a moon really badly.

2091
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:52,340
The gods, they don't agree on much at all.

2092
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:54,860
No, they do not.

2093
02:24:55,340 --> 02:24:58,080
Yet when the need arises, they can set their differences
aside.

2094
02:24:58,740 --> 02:25:00,160
Something to try with your own kin.

2095
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:03,060
You know who really gets what's going on up there?

2096
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:05,580
Did you know Nike is an actual god?

2097
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:07,340
It's the god of war.

2098
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:08,460
I didn't realize.

2099
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,020
I thought Nike just invented it.

2100
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:10,880
that word.

2101
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:15,880
Not a god, but like a phaer's, like an incarnate.

2102
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:18,400
You guys know that?

2103
02:25:20,120 --> 02:25:21,380
I was like, wait!

2104
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:23,540
Oh my god, she actually shot me.

2105
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,620
I can't do anything with the sheep, though.

2106
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:28,560
Like, she's in me.

2107
02:25:40,410 --> 02:25:40,810
Oh.

2108
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:44,690
Oh my god.

2109
02:25:47,730 --> 02:25:50,830
Oh my god, that's why it's called Nikkei.

2110
02:25:51,430 --> 02:25:52,410
My mind.

2111
02:25:52,970 --> 02:25:54,770
My mind is blown.

2112
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:59,230
I just realized I now know why it's called Nikkei.

2113
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:00,630
God is a victory.

2114
02:26:04,050 --> 02:26:05,930
It just clicked in my head, chat.

2115
02:26:06,870 --> 02:26:08,690
It actually just clicked in my head.

2116
02:26:09,430 --> 02:26:09,850
What the?

2117
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:11,970
I watched for it one time.

2118
02:26:19,340 --> 02:26:20,480
Oh, whoops.

2119
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:25,800
There you go.

2120
02:26:27,580 --> 02:26:28,720
It just clicked on me.

2121
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:30,360
I was like, oh my god.

2122
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:42,460
Guys, I have officially ran out of magic.

2123
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:45,360

Oh, hey, no enemies.

That's nice.

2144
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:23,220
Okay, we need magic.

2145
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:25,900
We definitely need magic.

2146
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:31,360
I want it to...

2147
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:33,240
And we need a throw casting.

2148
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:34,900
For sure.

2149
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:42,380
Sheep!

2150
02:29:43,320 --> 02:29:44,580

Oh, shit.

2152
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:47,240
I thought that was it.

2153
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:49,660
I didn't realize there were more.

2154
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:51,760
What?

2155
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:52,720
Okay, that's fine.

2156
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:55,580
No, no, no.

2157
02:29:57,140 --> 02:29:57,440
No.

2158
02:29:58,600 --> 02:29:58,920
No.

2159
02:29:59,020 --> 02:30:00,620
Don't let him get close to me.

2160
02:30:00,980 --> 02:30:01,780
Oh, my God.

2161
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:05,230
No, you...

2162
02:30:05,230 --> 02:30:06,070
Oh, my God.

2163
02:30:06,210 --> 02:30:06,750
Oh, my God.

2164
02:30:06,870 --> 02:30:07,470
Is he still there?

2165
02:30:09,990 --> 02:30:11,310
Is he still there?

2166
02:30:14,630 --> 02:30:15,650
Oh, my God.

2167
02:30:18,820 --> 02:30:20,680
As long as he's not still there.

2168
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:28,080
Oh, I palm or bird, oh, sorry not brain, palm or magic,

Oh, yeah, I can gamble rooms.

2171
02:30:33,220 --> 02:30:34,460
I survived the bird.

2172
02:30:38,820 --> 02:30:39,540
Alter the room?

2173
02:30:40,300 --> 02:30:41,320
But which room do we alter?

2174
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:42,940
Which one do you want bet on?

2175
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:44,780
Well, how do I alter it?

2176
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:45,700
Oh, here, alter this.

2177
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:45,940
Oh.

2178
02:30:46,380 --> 02:30:48,040
Which room do you want to alter on, guys?

2179
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:49,360
Which one do you want bet on?

2180
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:51,140
Want bet on magic or palm?

2181
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:54,480
You want better magic?

2182
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:58,060
Gamba, Gamba, Gamba!

2183
02:30:58,220 --> 02:30:59,280
What else?

2184
02:31:12,370 --> 02:31:14,950
Yes, I don't think we won the Gamba.

2185
02:31:18,710 --> 02:31:19,010
Alright.

2186
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:24,940
She...

2187
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:25,340
Alright.

2188
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:27,560
Pumped up.

2189
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:28,980
Oh!

2190
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:36,200
We didn't gamble hard enough.

2191
02:31:36,500 --> 02:31:38,060
Yeah, this run has been very unlucky.

2192
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:39,780
I don't really trust this run.

2193
02:31:41,480 --> 02:31:42,360
Okay, okay.

2194
02:31:42,680 --> 02:31:43,120
Excellent.

2195
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:47,440
I'm not feeling very confident right now.

2196
02:31:47,980 --> 02:31:48,360
Oh, deal!

2197
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:49,940
Yeah!

2198
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:51,160
Party!

2199
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:52,120
Party!

2200
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:53,080
Party!

2201
02:31:54,160 --> 02:31:55,960
You really are just passing through.

2202
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,180
Look at all these temptations in every form.

2203
02:31:58,540 --> 02:32:00,600
The liquid kind, the sumptuous kind.

2204
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:03,140
But you're unmoved and undeterred.

2205
02:32:03,860 --> 02:32:04,260
Yeah!

2206
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,360
Look, I would truly love to stay.

2207
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:08,900
Enjoy a beverage and a bite.

2208
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:11,020
Speak with all these doubtless interesting guests.

2209
02:32:11,420 --> 02:32:11,840
But I can't.

2210
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:13,260
Don't you understand?

2211
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:13,980
Your mountain is mountain.

2212
02:32:13,980 --> 02:32:14,860
It doesn't care.

2213
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:16,080
We're not partying.

2214
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:17,220
Look at all the guests.

2215
02:32:17,860 --> 02:32:18,700
Look at all the cities.

2216
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:20,200
They're partying.

2217
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:21,500
But I don't want to argue anymore.

2218
02:32:21,620 --> 02:32:23,280
I mean, it's just another form of fighting, yeah?

2219
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:25,420
So you go do your thing and I'll do mine.

2220
02:32:25,780 --> 02:32:26,020
Yeah.

2221
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:29,180
Our special is this eve.

2222
02:32:32,020 --> 02:32:32,420
Ah.

2223
02:32:34,180 --> 02:32:35,820
Congrats, power.

2224
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:40,980
And each fog appears, making you stronger.

2225
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:41,440
Three?

2226
02:32:42,060 --> 02:32:42,700
Oh, wait, yeah.

2227
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:44,660
Because I do cast.

2228
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:47,360
There's no war in Mount Olympus.

2229
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:49,740
Yeah, he's just like, what are you talking about?

2230
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:51,980
Everything is chill, bro.

2231
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:56,640
All right, I guess we go get Poseidon.

2232
02:32:58,120 --> 02:32:59,180
Poseidon time.

2233
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:03,740
Maybe we can get more gosh.

2234
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:06,480
I'd like a word with Lord Hephaestus about you.

2235
02:33:09,640 --> 02:33:10,040
Jesus.

2236
02:33:13,300 --> 02:33:13,780
Hey, yeah.

2237
02:33:13,820 --> 02:33:14,940
Thank you for the- Oh my god.

2238
02:33:15,160 --> 02:33:15,440
Oh my god.

Sorry.

Thank you for the red.

2242
02:33:17,060 --> 02:33:17,880
Thank you.

2243
02:33:17,900 --> 02:33:18,920
We had a great sheep!

2244
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:20,540
He doesn't turn to sheep.

2245
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:21,320
It's crazy.

2246
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:23,700
It's like he's like not a thing or some shit.

2247
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:26,080
I don't understand.

2248
02:33:26,600 --> 02:33:28,480
Why doesn't he turn in the sheep?

2249
02:33:31,860 --> 02:33:32,260
Oh!

2250
02:33:32,420 --> 02:33:32,420
Oh!

2251
02:33:32,700 --> 02:33:34,320
Okay, it's It's just my armor.

2252
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:37,020
It's like he's not real or some shit.

That's actually crazy that that hits me.

2255
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:50,160
Jesus Okay

2256
02:33:53,180 --> 02:34:00,080
But what if he does turn in his sheep I don't I don't know
Unless

2257
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:06,360
As what if...

2258
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:07,940
I'm just saying.

2259
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:11,860
What if he does turn into sheep?

2260
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,460
Maybe if I try hard enough, yeah.

2261
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:20,260
Maybe he'll turn into an electric sheep.

2262
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:22,620
You pick the wrong target.

2263
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:26,980
Wait, do you?

2264
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:27,360
Do you?

2265
02:34:27,580 --> 02:34:29,040
You talked about Zeus.

2266
02:34:29,940 --> 02:34:32,460
Who gave my absence?

2267
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:37,380
Oh, never mind.

2268
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:39,950
He just wanted to be like, yeah, my brother's Zeus, by the
way.

2269
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:46,060
Oh, I'd wake a hint that knocks foes away.

2270
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:48,040
Makes you briefly restore any...

2271
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:49,980
What?

2272
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:52,940
Blood gain?

2273
02:34:53,220 --> 02:34:54,400
Okay, we'll do one.

2274
02:35:01,930 --> 02:35:04,730
But what if we have more HP?

2275
02:35:07,910 --> 02:35:09,930
I feel like HP.

2276
02:35:15,030 --> 02:35:16,570
I feel like we get enough magic now.

2277
02:35:16,710 --> 02:35:18,350
We have Flood again.

2278
02:35:19,050 --> 02:35:20,330
So I think it should be fine.

2279
02:35:21,670 --> 02:35:24,110
Just because we have mana regen now.

2280
02:35:26,850 --> 02:35:27,810
Oh, no.

2281
02:35:28,710 --> 02:35:30,830
I'm just hoping my free will is working.

2282
02:35:33,090 --> 02:35:33,410
Okay.

2283
02:35:33,750 --> 02:35:34,250
Sheep!

2284
02:35:35,370 --> 02:35:35,670
Yes!

2285
02:35:35,690 --> 02:35:36,050
Yeah!

2286
02:35:36,310 --> 02:35:36,910
Sheep!

2287
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:42,780
Okay, nice.

2288
02:35:43,020 --> 02:35:43,240
It's fine.

2289
02:35:45,320 --> 02:35:46,140
There you go.

2290
02:35:47,380 --> 02:35:48,560
Yes, yeah.

2291
02:35:49,700 --> 02:35:50,180
Oh, moon!

2292
02:35:50,380 --> 02:35:50,860
Fuck!

2293
02:35:51,340 --> 02:35:54,600
Oh, I feel like we need sheep, but...

2294
02:35:55,400 --> 02:35:55,760
Alright.

2295
02:35:56,220 --> 02:35:57,020
Moon or hammer?

2296
02:35:57,280 --> 02:35:58,720
This is very hard decision.

2297
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:03,460
Oh, this is so hard.

2298
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:06,240
Hammer time?

2299
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,580
Oh, but...

2300
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:11,560
We don't have any moon upgrades.

2301
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:13,460
Okay, okay, hammer tap.

2302
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:17,260
Ready?

2303
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:18,960
Oh shit, wait, we got...

2304
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:20,320
I gotta activate this.

2305
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:24,060
I'm gonna activate it just for the sake of it.

2306
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:27,560
Just in case.

2307
02:36:28,940 --> 02:36:29,240

Oh, I see.

I was like, I'm going to go start fishing.

2319
02:37:22,470 --> 02:37:23,410
In the middle of this.

All right.

2326
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:50,180
Manifest your desire.

2327
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:54,060
Oh, 300 plus 400 damage.

2328
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:56,020
We're not going to make it, though.

2329
02:38:01,390 --> 02:38:03,490
I feel like we have to try and get that.

2330
02:38:06,250 --> 02:38:07,490
5% damage.

2331
02:38:09,690 --> 02:38:10,490
10%, 5%.

2332
02:38:11,890 --> 02:38:12,290
10%.

2333
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:13,270
Last two seconds.

2334
02:38:13,370 --> 02:38:14,510
Okay, we got it at the bottom.

2335
02:38:15,010 --> 02:38:16,350
1, 2, 3, 4.

2336
02:38:16,670 --> 02:38:17,930
I'm going to aim for this.

2337
02:38:21,150 --> 02:38:23,150
Yeah, I'm going to aim for...

2338
02:38:24,230 --> 02:38:25,490
I'm going to aim for the bottom.

2339
02:38:26,210 --> 02:38:27,710
I just need another moon.

2340
02:38:33,370 --> 02:38:34,890
Do I need more ash?

2341
02:38:35,150 --> 02:38:36,410
I don't think I need more ash.

2342
02:38:36,530 --> 02:38:37,530
I might as well just get psyche.

2343
02:38:39,310 --> 02:38:40,550
Oh, there's no way I don't think we need more.

2344
02:38:42,570 --> 02:38:43,270
Oh, nice.

2345
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:45,610
Oh, that did nothing.

2346
02:38:48,330 --> 02:38:48,850
Whoopsie!

2347
02:38:50,330 --> 02:38:52,470
I did not know what that did.

2348
02:38:57,310 --> 02:38:58,710
Okay, he's very slow.

2349
02:38:58,730 --> 02:38:59,410
walking up.

2350
02:38:59,630 --> 02:38:59,870
It's okay.

2351
02:38:59,970 --> 02:39:00,850
I have sheep!

2352
02:39:01,870 --> 02:39:01,990

2353
02:39:02,770 --> 02:39:03,370

Nice.

2356
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:13,430
And then...

2357
02:39:13,430 --> 02:39:19,070
I'm a little worried about this because I use my sheep
already.

2358
02:39:20,290 --> 02:39:22,170
So... And I'm stuck in the corner.

2359
02:39:22,470 --> 02:39:22,670

2360
02:39:23,350 --> 02:39:25,870
Oh my god.

2361
02:39:26,610 --> 02:39:27,470
I'm stuck in the corner.

2362
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:28,410
Oh my god!

2363
02:39:28,490 --> 02:39:28,710

I fucking hate fighting him.

2373
02:40:10,030 --> 02:40:10,850
I don't have a lot of money.

2374
02:40:11,010 --> 02:40:11,450
It's fine.

2375
02:40:11,970 --> 02:40:12,870
I'm by everything.

I guess... Gamba?

2378
02:40:28,280 --> 02:40:30,080
There's not much to Gamba anymore.

02:40:30,100 --> 02:40:32,860
more, but last minute Gamba?

2380
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:34,440

2383
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:38,080
Okay.

2384
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:41,580

02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:43,040
Alright, let's get more HP.

2386
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:44,720
HP is fine.

2387
02:40:57,150 --> 02:40:57,650
Um.

2388
02:40:58,650 --> 02:41:00,510
Yeah, it's too late for Gamba.

2389
02:41:01,070 --> 02:41:02,370
Especially the last area.

2390
02:41:03,650 --> 02:41:04,210

2391
02:41:06,670 --> 02:41:08,590

A shade responded strangely when I mentioned you, but can't
seem to remember what you did.

2401
02:41:32,010 --> 02:41:33,410

This fucking sucks.

2413
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:02,520
Okay, maybe I should have saved my sheep for this.

2414
02:43:04,580 --> 02:43:05,480
Alright, that's fine.

2415
02:43:12,740 --> 02:43:14,740
Okay, that's a fucker.

Guys, what's after bottom?

02:44:01,410 --> 02:44:02,550
Top, top, middle.

2432
02:44:04,370 --> 02:44:04,970
No!

I got stuck in the fucking corner.

2485
02:48:05,950 --> 02:48:06,670
This fortress is your grave.

2486
02:48:08,970 --> 02:48:14,130
If there's one good thing about this war, it's that even our
most preserved family members have to rise up.

2487
02:48:14,150 --> 02:48:20,870
and make themselves known or just make themselves known in
the case of my good son if esther's here what is this duo

There's nothing else I can grab.

2493
02:48:55,480 --> 02:49:01,000
The sound brood of storm-bringing Typhon crawl through the
growing cracks in the stonework of the fortress of...

2494
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,520
Guys, I don't know if I'm going to make it, guys.

2497

Oh my god.

2498
02:49:19,060 --> 02:49:22,300
I don't even know what hit me.

2499
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:23,000

2500
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:26,300
The worst part is like...

2501
02:49:26,300 --> 02:49:29,340
I don't even know what hit me there.

2502
02:49:32,540 --> 02:49:33,920
Was I next to an egg?

2503
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:35,840
I couldn't even see it.

2504
02:49:39,330 --> 02:49:42,070
There's so many things happening to me.

2505
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:43,750

2577
02:58:21,940 --> 02:58:23,580
Oh, my God.

2578
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:25,360
That was a little too close.

2579
02:58:25,560 --> 02:58:26,900
A little too close, guys.

2580
02:58:27,820 --> 02:58:28,240
I got it.

2581
02:58:28,320 --> 02:58:29,780
I like to make it exciting, you know?

2582
02:58:29,940 --> 02:58:32,040
Like, we've been fighting him so many times.

2583
02:58:36,680 --> 02:58:39,940
Just wanted to make it a little exciting, chat.

2584
02:58:43,980 --> 02:58:45,820
Oh, one more Typhon.

2585
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:48,000
One more Typhon.

2586
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:53,740
And we'd be free of the surface, bro Yeah, I'm just content
guys.

2587
02:58:53,880 --> 02:59:02,960
It's just content Typhon is not backing down though we shall
drive him back each night he deems to threaten us if that is

2588
02:59:02,960 --> 02:59:13,530
what it takes Yeah, I had to keep things super tense guys Or
we could probably destroy him along with this mountain and a

2589
02:59:13,530 --> 02:59:21,790
good portion of the surrounding countryside Although where
would we live thereafter We needn't wait that possibility at

2590
02:59:21,790 --> 02:59:22,970
all, Haram, my dear.

2591
02:59:23,670 --> 02:59:25,270
Best not to even speak of it.

2592
02:59:25,870 --> 02:59:27,450
Melinui assured us Typhon could be done.

2593
02:59:27,450 --> 02:59:28,830
One more run.

2594
02:59:29,670 --> 02:59:31,190
One more run.

2595
02:59:32,090 --> 02:59:34,850
I've not intended to make promises on that account, not
Uncle.

2596
02:59:35,310 --> 02:59:37,930
Does Kratos get harder when his final run?

2597
02:59:38,370 --> 02:59:39,730
Or is it the same?

2598
02:59:41,750 --> 02:59:42,930
Do as you must, Melinui.

2599
02:59:43,470 --> 02:59:48,410
We shall be waiting to hear word of your success, and you
can count on all our blessings on the way.

2600
02:59:49,530 --> 02:59:50,190
Oh, thank God.

2601
02:59:50,250 --> 02:59:50,690
I can speak.

02:59:50,710 --> 02:59:57,590

and i'm gonna die during kronos we're dealing with all this

2603
02:59:57,590 --> 03:00:05,550
light however i'm not used to yet we're not much used to it
here either for how dark it's been of late though let's get

2604
03:00:05,550 --> 03:00:15,690
you back before it drains you more take care now all right
half i go should typhon rise again oh smile oh no

2605
03:00:20,710 --> 03:00:23,490
It's hard to see him.

2606
03:00:23,490 --> 03:00:28,190
Return to shadow now.

2607
03:00:29,390 --> 03:00:30,430
What are you mean?

2608
03:00:31,750 --> 03:00:32,690
What are you mean?

2609
03:00:34,850 --> 03:00:37,010
Closer to the incantations we require.

2610
03:00:39,430 --> 03:00:42,610
I never imagined I'd see the palace of Zeus with my own
eyes.

2611
03:00:42,730 --> 03:00:43,050
You know what?

2612
03:00:43,070 --> 03:00:43,550
It's fine.

2613
03:00:43,710 --> 03:00:48,910
I'm fine with Kronos only because I don't have to fucking
fight like Prometheus after this.

2614
03:00:49,550 --> 03:00:50,690
I hope you don't mind.

2615
03:00:50,710 --> 03:00:57,650
but I asked Prometheus himself about this old connection
that you feel he's cagey with his words but does seem to

2616
03:00:57,650 --> 03:01:05,010
remember you in turn kind of weird of you to do that
especially since it sounds like he's trying to kill your

2617
03:01:05,010 --> 03:01:13,870
family up there but thanks what do you say well he said he's
not to blame for mortal kinds failings and such and that

2618
03:01:13,870 --> 03:01:22,990
neither are you and asked I tell you so on his behalf oh
what does she do What was her sin?

2619
03:01:23,810 --> 03:01:25,710
I mean, we're best friends, so I feel like...

2620
03:01:27,270 --> 03:01:29,050
Like, clearly she didn't get punished.

2621
03:01:30,550 --> 03:01:31,990
It's Prometheus and me.

2622
03:01:32,170 --> 03:01:36,870
We're docking stomachaches, heartaches, taxation, lying,
cheating, you name it.

2623
03:01:39,390 --> 03:01:43,330
It's utter nonsense, but do you have any idea what he could
have meant?

2624
03:01:44,890 --> 03:01:45,330
Nope.

2625
03:01:45,910 --> 03:01:48,710
But since you're the one who's talking to him on the
regular, maybe you could ask.

2626
03:01:49,050 --> 03:01:49,970
Now that we're curious.

2627
03:01:51,310 --> 03:01:51,870
Alright.

2628
03:01:52,790 --> 03:01:53,710
Yeah, what does she do?

2629
03:01:55,950 --> 03:01:56,910
You're nice.

2630
03:01:59,290 --> 03:02:01,150
I know the Titan Prometheus.

2631
03:02:01,730 --> 03:02:02,790
I faced him on Olympus.

2632
03:02:03,530 --> 03:02:06,710
Little wonder he now fights against the gods, having met his
doom and lived.

2633
03:02:07,490 --> 03:02:10,630
Unlike the mortals he supposedly cares for so much.

2634
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:14,510
Prometheus, I took no pleasure in his plight.

2635
03:02:15,310 --> 03:02:17,810
The gods certainly know how to make an example of someone.

2636
03:02:18,510 --> 03:02:19,590
Now he seeks vengeance.

2637
03:02:20,710 --> 03:02:27,070
pattern and the weavings of the fates now that you mention
it his knowledge of the future seems similar to that of your

2638
03:02:27,070 --> 03:02:36,590
sisters do you suppose he sided with Kronos because he knows
Kronos will we're gonna change the future change the world

2639
03:02:36,590 --> 03:02:45,390
there's no way that's why he joined Kronos oh he bet wrong
we're gonna rig the match little does he know we're rigging

2640
03:02:45,390 --> 03:02:53,990
that match we slipped we slip the fates like three million
dollars oh no that's too little for them we slip the fates

2641
03:02:53,990 --> 03:03:01,890
like a hundred million dollars one step closer i've had
these in my head for long enough oh my god thank fucking god

2642
03:03:01,890 --> 03:03:15,470
i can make it now oh my god yes yes all consumed within that
flood oh my god this is it

2643
03:03:19,190 --> 03:03:20,410
We got it!

2644
03:03:20,830 --> 03:03:21,670
It's here!

2645
03:03:24,050 --> 03:03:24,490
Alright.

2646
03:03:25,930 --> 03:03:26,950
We can make...

2647
03:03:26,950 --> 03:03:28,030
Oh, get an olive.

2648
03:03:29,570 --> 03:03:30,010
Fabric.

2649
03:03:30,250 --> 03:03:30,990
Wait, what's this?

2650
03:03:35,140 --> 03:03:35,940
Are you a fresh air?

2651
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:36,880
Oh, I just need fabric?

2652
03:03:36,960 --> 03:03:38,260
I can grab that right now.

2653
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:43,480
Alright.

2654
03:03:45,340 --> 03:03:46,520
Oh, moon dust.

2655
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:48,060
Oh, I do not have enough for that.

2656
03:03:49,640 --> 03:03:51,220
Grab a nectar here, too.

2657
03:03:51,680 --> 03:03:52,420
Just for a sake.

2658
03:03:53,100 --> 03:03:53,200
Uh...

2659
03:03:54,520 --> 03:03:55,780
Just for the sake of it.

2660
03:04:02,800 --> 03:04:03,880
Boy, thank you for the super chat.

2661
03:04:04,100 --> 03:04:04,200
Thank you.

2662
03:04:04,580 --> 03:04:04,900
Thank you.

2663
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:06,780
Good luck on your supposed final run.

2664
03:04:06,860 --> 03:04:07,960
Don't give me sleep now.

2665
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:08,980
All right, good night, boy.

2666
03:04:09,100 --> 03:04:11,040
Okay, there's final run on the surface, bro.

2667
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:13,200
And then we'll be free from the surface.

2668
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:20,360
Man, I might as well make this run.

2669
03:04:21,880 --> 03:04:23,120
Let's kill this because I can.

2670
03:04:27,960 --> 03:04:28,540
All right.

2671
03:04:29,060 --> 03:04:30,020
All right.

2672
03:04:30,880 --> 03:04:32,380
Sadly, I don't have olives.

2673
03:04:32,540 --> 03:04:35,520
You know the great Olympian defender, Talos?

2674
03:04:36,340 --> 03:04:39,740
One of the most ingenious inventions of Hephaestus and a
walking work of art.

2675
03:04:40,440 --> 03:04:43,540
Yet utterly unable to distinguish friend from foe.

2676
03:04:45,380 --> 03:04:48,880
That disappointing lack of judgment allegedly is not an
oversight.

2677
03:04:49,720 --> 03:04:55,460
Olympus deploys Talos where they want no one to tread, and
lately, their own mountain is that place.

2678
03:04:56,860 --> 03:05:00,280
Sometimes I think Olympus doesn't have the most cohesive
plan for their defense.

2679
03:05:00,280 --> 03:05:08,740
isn't Lady Athena herself supposed to be what plaid they
really rely on me for everything a little girl you know your

2680
03:05:08,740 --> 03:05:15,960
family goddess in matters of importance they all want
hundreds of years being immortal and their plan is to rely

2681
03:05:15,960 --> 03:05:25,880
on me costly to repair my father's spear Gai Gauras you have
planned Zagreus must have gotten access to it in his time as

2682
03:05:25,880 --> 03:05:35,020
I have now one final step then not quite I'm a little girl
compared to the fucking old-ass gods and she'll take every

2683
03:05:35,020 --> 03:05:42,780
precaution to ensure it shall have the intended result
Entropy is the last reagent we require for the dissolution

2684
03:05:42,780 --> 03:05:45,360
of time, but where am I supposed to find it?

2685
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:54,160
I found no traces yet, even from typhon Where are you
supposed to create it if they live on the mountain, who

2686
03:05:54,160 --> 03:05:55,120
would hurt them?

2687
03:05:55,660 --> 03:06:00,260
Powerful enough force must be put entirely to rest Do you?

2688
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:09,280
i believe so all right oh she's finally back i swear she's
been gone for so long walking typhon from his perch oh we

2689
03:06:09,280 --> 03:06:16,640
all heard you got a dozen family members all up there some
of them strong so what do they need you for they certainly

2690
03:06:16,640 --> 03:06:26,180
are capable but they're backed into a corner on olympus
please understand the mountain is rather tall it's like guys

2691
03:06:26,180 --> 03:06:39,080
guys here's the plan we live mountain there's no way
anyone's gonna fucking come here or just trying to appease

2692
03:06:39,080 --> 03:06:45,200
me the main reason you want is that monster yeah but for men
they see a mountain and they're gonna be like i want to

2693
03:06:45,200 --> 03:06:53,040
climb it what's that supposed to mean you'll see

2694
03:06:56,060 --> 03:07:06,560
all right typhon perhaps this night shall be your last oh
true showed to the world beyond the crossroads the altar of

2695
03:07:06,560 --> 03:07:19,480
ashes thrums with ancient power boundless men see a mountain
just think wood why do you climb the mountain because it's

2696
03:07:19,480 --> 03:07:33,280
there the bangle may we convert hey would you attest to my
disciples that i've taught you a great deal when it comes to

2697
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:37,980
fighting typhon they've been getting a little unruly and
you'll be doing me a favor

2698
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:48,320
but commander you've not told me anything about him ah i
know what this is you wish to see if i would stoop to

2699
03:07:48,320 --> 03:07:56,680
speaking falsehoods merely because i was asked um yeah yeah
yeah it was a test girl yeah come on young one would you

2700
03:07:56,680 --> 03:08:06,940
just do this for me here come on just just lie be okay one
little All right, here we go.

2701
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:09,420
Here we go.

2702
03:08:09,900 --> 03:08:10,640
Finished business here.

2703
03:08:16,350 --> 03:08:16,970
All right.

2704
03:08:19,170 --> 03:08:19,710
Oh.

2705
03:08:19,930 --> 03:08:23,010
The Typhon is far from invincible, no matter how it seems.

2706
03:08:23,470 --> 03:08:27,470
When first you dared attack Olympus long ago, I personally
struck him down.

2707
03:08:27,970 --> 03:08:31,490
But now he does seem more resistance to my lightning than
before.

2708
03:08:34,210 --> 03:08:34,810
Oh, nice.

2709
03:08:35,010 --> 03:08:35,590
My special.

2710
03:08:37,710 --> 03:08:38,310
epic.

2711
03:08:39,690 --> 03:08:41,210
Alright, I guess we'll do specials, right?

2712
03:08:41,350 --> 03:08:41,650
One?

2713
03:08:44,570 --> 03:08:46,950
I feel like one, just so we can...

2714
03:08:52,980 --> 03:08:55,860
Okay, we definitely need some mana recharge somewhere
though.

2715
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:57,360
Yeah.

2716
03:08:59,080 --> 03:09:00,240
Okay, Hermes...

2717
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:11,270
Oh shit, I didn't... Nice.

2718
03:09:14,370 --> 03:09:15,970
All right, Burmese.

2719
03:09:16,550 --> 03:09:18,610
Who do you think can make it to the top of Mount Olympus
first, then?

2720
03:09:18,790 --> 03:09:19,450
You are old Typhon.

2721
03:09:19,810 --> 03:09:22,230
You've got a longer way to go, sure, but you're definitely
faster.

2722
03:09:22,950 --> 03:09:23,030
Yeah!

2723
03:09:24,130 --> 03:09:25,250
I want to be fast.

2724
03:09:26,190 --> 03:09:26,390
Oh.

2725
03:09:29,410 --> 03:09:29,870
Ooh.

2726
03:09:33,790 --> 03:09:35,070
I feel like...

2727
03:09:35,070 --> 03:09:35,430
Ooh.

2728
03:09:36,370 --> 03:09:37,250
Three, right?

2729
03:09:37,670 --> 03:09:38,250
More money?

2730
03:09:40,030 --> 03:09:40,810
I'll grab three.

2731
03:09:41,130 --> 03:09:42,450
Early game money time.

2732
03:09:44,390 --> 03:09:45,770
Grab this too.

2733
03:09:46,270 --> 03:09:47,390
Just squeeze on through.

2734
03:09:47,750 --> 03:09:49,830
I gotta squeeze as much money as possible.

2735
03:09:53,570 --> 03:09:53,890
Whoa.

2736
03:09:54,930 --> 03:09:56,090
Okay, we'll grab Moon.

2737
03:09:57,890 --> 03:09:59,590
Let's hope for heals or...

2738
03:09:59,590 --> 03:10:01,510
Out of heals or...

2739
03:10:01,510 --> 03:10:02,530
Uh, cheap.

2740
03:10:03,970 --> 03:10:05,050
Oh my god.

2741
03:10:05,130 --> 03:10:07,030
I hope I don't get unlucky here.

2742
03:10:07,430 --> 03:10:08,970
Judging by my luck.

2743
03:10:12,070 --> 03:10:13,510
Okay, we're gonna grab this.

2744
03:10:13,750 --> 03:10:17,140
All right.

2745
03:10:17,420 --> 03:10:18,220
Shades, I release you.

2746
03:10:19,280 --> 03:10:19,940
Be free!

2747
03:10:23,620 --> 03:10:24,180
Okay.

2748
03:10:24,660 --> 03:10:26,320
Long have I been the eye of night.

2749
03:10:27,080 --> 03:10:29,360
Watching you grow and train in secrecy.

2750
03:10:29,820 --> 03:10:33,560
Knowing that upon some evenings such as those- I have
parlors matter each in.

2751
03:10:34,500 --> 03:10:35,440
If they give it to me.

2752
03:10:38,080 --> 03:10:38,460
Oh.

2753
03:10:40,060 --> 03:10:41,620
Oh, fuck, they give me heal.

2754
03:10:41,900 --> 03:10:42,800

Oh my god.

2760
03:11:23,200 --> 03:11:23,220
Oh!

2761
03:11:31,540 --> 03:11:32,220
Okay.

2762
03:11:33,480 --> 03:11:34,620
We'll go with three.

2763
03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:37,960
Sheep.

2764
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:39,920
Sheep hasn't disappointed me yet.

2765
03:11:44,620 --> 03:11:45,320
Oh, whoops.

2766
03:11:46,100 --> 03:11:47,580

03:11:54,040 --> 03:11:55,400
Oh, let's transform you.

2770
03:11:55,920 --> 03:11:57,280
I mean, that's fine.

2771
03:11:59,980 --> 03:12:03,100
Let's get the early transformation out of there.

2772
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:08,360
Believe in the sheep.

2773
03:12:08,880 --> 03:12:09,860
Who believes in me.

2774
03:12:11,040 --> 03:12:12,460
Okay, we'll grab hammer next.

2775
03:12:15,420 --> 03:12:16,580
Where is the hammer?

2776
03:12:16,860 --> 03:12:17,800
Where else can we go?

2777
03:12:18,280 --> 03:12:19,220
Okay, that's at the bottom.

2778
03:12:27,930 --> 03:12:28,530
Alright, nice.

2779
03:12:28,690 --> 03:12:29,070
Whoa!

2780
03:12:29,330 --> 03:12:31,230

2785
03:13:24,740 --> 03:13:26,080
But we sheep now.

2786
03:13:27,660 --> 03:13:28,980
But we sheep, okay.

2787
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:34,960
Oh, I'm just thinking like, if we had got minion.

2788
03:13:36,600 --> 03:13:37,460
Let's have a look around.

2789
03:13:37,880 --> 03:13:38,760
I'm gonna grab HP.

2790
03:13:39,420 --> 03:13:40,680
HP is always good.

2791
03:13:45,840 --> 03:13:47,080
Oh yeah, Athena.

2792
03:13:48,660 --> 03:13:49,560
I mean, that's always good.

2793
03:14:03,380 --> 03:14:03,780
Okay

2794
03:14:07,080 --> 03:14:08,340

2795
03:14:12,780 --> 03:14:20,840
Jesus Christ there's so many Yeah, I need matter regen
really badly

2796
03:14:24,220 --> 03:14:26,480
Why aren't you killing him then?

2797
03:14:27,340 --> 03:14:28,540
Oh, sorry Artemis.

2798
03:14:28,600 --> 03:14:36,420
Oh, I forgot to shoot this Artemis Athena I They both start
with A.

2799
03:14:37,140 --> 03:14:38,700
Olympus managed to take Typhon down.

2800
03:14:39,560 --> 03:14:42,220
I figure with your aid, probably Sister Selene's too.

2801
03:14:43,240 --> 03:14:44,880
I guess I wasn't needed up there actually.

2802
03:14:44,880 --> 03:14:50,200
I mean they're both like related to like fighting, hunting,
war, same thing.

2803
03:14:50,360 --> 03:14:52,280
But I don't think we've probably discouraged him.

2804
03:14:52,840 --> 03:14:55,020
Not yet at least, though I have a few ideas.

2805
03:14:57,120 --> 03:15:02,500
If your ideas involve an arrow in his eye, of which I hear
he has a lot, let me know.

2806
03:15:05,580 --> 03:15:06,340
Ah!

2807
03:15:09,020 --> 03:15:10,100
Oh cute.

2808
03:15:10,420 --> 03:15:12,780
After you dash removes me deal.

2809
03:15:16,720 --> 03:15:17,260
Oh!

2810
03:15:17,560 --> 03:15:18,280
Support fire!

2811
03:15:18,740 --> 03:15:19,420
One or three?

2812
03:15:22,960 --> 03:15:23,400
One?

2813
03:15:28,400 --> 03:15:28,960
Alright.

2814
03:15:29,480 --> 03:15:30,580
My strength is yours.

2815
03:15:31,140 --> 03:15:31,660
Oh yeah, nice.

2816
03:15:31,780 --> 03:15:32,260
Free room.

2817
03:15:34,280 --> 03:15:36,940
Oh, I should have went when I'm still...

2818
03:15:38,480 --> 03:15:42,620
I mean, sheep has, he has, the sheep has been with me
throughout the ride.

2819
03:15:42,740 --> 03:15:47,580
But I'm thinking like, if I had a minion, literally he could
just beat him up for me.

2820
03:15:50,960 --> 03:15:52,580
But it's too late.

2821
03:15:53,560 --> 03:15:55,220
Non-sheep believer.

2822
03:15:58,780 --> 03:16:01,200
How dare you die up the sheep?

2823
03:16:03,560 --> 03:16:04,660
All right, we have three left.

2824
03:16:05,960 --> 03:16:06,780
What else is here?

2825
03:16:07,520 --> 03:16:08,960
Alright, who do we want to get?

2826
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:10,140
There's Poseidon.

2827
03:16:10,700 --> 03:16:15,340
We have Poseidon, Zeus, Apollo, Magic, and Aphrodite.

2828
03:16:24,750 --> 03:16:25,630
Alright, we'll try out Apollo.

2829
03:16:25,750 --> 03:16:27,650
We'll gamma for Apollo regen then.

2830
03:16:30,670 --> 03:16:33,350
Because we really need a regen right now.

2831
03:16:34,050 --> 03:16:35,010
It's pretty bad.

2832
03:16:40,540 --> 03:16:41,320
Are y'all dead?

2833
03:16:41,540 --> 03:16:42,340
Like, where are they?

2834
03:16:43,060 --> 03:16:46,140
Like, where are the fucking creatures?

2835
03:16:52,310 --> 03:16:53,910
Where's the last- oh there he is.

2836
03:16:54,790 --> 03:16:55,770
Oh I didn't even see that house.

2837
03:16:56,050 --> 03:16:57,750
That's why there were so many houses.

2838
03:17:00,290 --> 03:17:04,970
I was like wondering where they're coming- oh no I don't
have- oh this is bad.

2839
03:17:06,470 --> 03:17:08,450
I really need mana regen.

2840
03:17:10,150 --> 03:17:14,850
It couldn't have been easier for you being at the palace
here at the break of dawn.

2841
03:17:15,370 --> 03:17:17,090
Probably much more light than you're used to.

2842
03:17:17,630 --> 03:17:20,490
We're hardly used to either now thanks to all of Typhon's
storms.

2843
03:17:22,330 --> 03:17:27,950
all right oh yeah wait that's oh my god and it's epic too

03:18:07,220 --> 03:18:08,500
Oh god, it's all fire.

2848
03:18:10,240 --> 03:18:11,340
Oh god, get rid of the house.

2849
03:18:12,220 --> 03:18:12,840
It's against...

2850
03:18:12,840 --> 03:18:13,900
It's not up to code.

2851
03:18:16,460 --> 03:18:16,720
You know what?

2852
03:18:16,720 --> 03:18:17,560

I was getting...

2882
03:20:39,320 --> 03:20:40,460
I'm trying to figure out.

2883
03:20:41,020 --> 03:20:41,800
That sheep tab.

2884
03:20:42,560 --> 03:20:44,460
Oh my god, the house turned into a sheep.

2885
03:20:45,700 --> 03:20:46,660

He's like, I did you see you drink that fountain?

2950
03:25:41,820 --> 03:25:43,560
Hydration is very important.

2951
03:25:48,740 --> 03:25:50,180

2952
03:25:55,890 --> 03:25:56,630

03:25:56,750 --> 03:25:58,230
Just for the sake of it.

2954
03:26:02,880 --> 03:26:03,580
He's blind.

2955
03:26:03,740 --> 03:26:04,860
What is he going to do now?

2956
03:26:05,500 --> 03:26:06,600
I'm going to pick some wood, though.

2957
03:26:08,500 --> 03:26:08,940
Hmm.

2958
03:26:13,680 --> 03:26:14,000
You know what?

2962
03:26:19,200 --> 03:26:20,980
I don't really need...

2963
03:26:20,980 --> 03:26:23,580
I should have just... I should have kept...

2964
03:26:23,580 --> 03:26:26,340
I actually should have just kept the...

2965
03:26:27,580 --> 03:26:28,800
So I just kept the heels.

2966
03:26:28,940 --> 03:26:30,600
I think the heels would have actually been clutch.

2967
03:26:31,600 --> 03:26:32,160
Not now.

2968
03:26:38,750 --> 03:26:39,750
Alright, that's fine.

2969
03:26:45,700 --> 03:26:46,180

Alright, we're actually gonna try and grab heals, though.

2976
03:27:10,980 --> 03:27:13,080
We don't have a lot of that going in.

2977
03:27:13,640 --> 03:27:15,660
We're a little bit poorer right now.

2978
03:27:19,590 --> 03:27:19,950

03:28:55,060 --> 03:28:55,940
It's okay, I have sheep.

2996
03:28:56,820 --> 03:28:58,800
If all else fails, I do have sheep.

03:31:28,220 --> 03:31:31,260
Bro, bro, she's into him.

Uno reversaled it.

3040
03:32:38,300 --> 03:32:41,040
The morpher has become the morphe.

3041
03:32:42,280 --> 03:32:43,280
Oh, yeah, there you go.

3042
03:32:44,260 --> 03:32:46,600
What I learned is that I could turn this into sheep.

3043
03:32:47,480 --> 03:32:48,880

Okay, but one more sheep.

3052
03:33:47,920 --> 03:33:49,480

Come on, let's you have two sheep?

3054

How many ships have fallen in that mall?

3055
03:33:56,920 --> 03:33:58,020
I did take a lot of damage.

3056
03:33:58,160 --> 03:33:59,340
I really need health though.

3057
03:34:01,180 --> 03:34:06,020
It was my least HP run.

3058
03:34:19,640 --> 03:34:20,260

3069
03:35:19,920 --> 03:35:21,140
I don't remember.

3070
03:35:22,040 --> 03:35:24,960
How do I check?

3071
03:35:25,380 --> 03:35:26,580
I wonder if there's a way to check.

3072
03:35:27,180 --> 03:35:28,060
Does anyone remember?

3073
03:35:34,630 --> 03:35:36,430
How do I check if I gifted shit?

3074
03:35:42,700 --> 03:35:45,400
There's monsters, familiars.

3075

beneath the earth and chronos is responsible for all of it

3089
03:37:20,710 --> 03:37:26,750
time apparently wishes to ruin everything eventually though
we are not about to let him have his way we'll drive his

3113
03:38:31,190 --> 03:38:31,770
It's fine.

3114
03:38:32,270 --> 03:38:33,630
Yeah, shoot time.

3115
03:38:35,610 --> 03:38:36,730
Yeah, my favorites.

3116
03:38:39,390 --> 03:38:41,250
There's a lot of people on this ship.

3117
03:38:41,310 --> 03:38:42,250
I did not expect that.

3118
03:38:42,530 --> 03:38:43,190
Which way now?

3119
03:38:44,630 --> 03:38:46,290
Oh, these are all pretty bad.

3120
03:38:47,270 --> 03:38:48,610
I'll grab the bones.

3121
03:38:49,530 --> 03:38:50,290
Since I need it.

3122
03:38:50,430 --> 03:38:51,650
And I'll grab this too.

3123
03:38:54,490 --> 03:38:55,570
Alright, sheep time.

3124
03:38:56,610 --> 03:38:56,890
Yeah!

3125
03:39:00,370 --> 03:39:01,450
What the fuck?

3126
03:39:01,530 --> 03:39:02,610
Where did you come from?

3127
03:39:03,590 --> 03:39:04,910
Bro, I hate that.

3128
03:39:05,690 --> 03:39:07,490
I don't see them anywhere.

3129
03:39:11,090 --> 03:39:22,710
Just the last guy hello oh wait he's dead i thought there

3132
03:39:48,000 --> 03:39:48,600
What's this do?

3133
03:39:48,840 --> 03:39:49,560
Oh, there's a shop!

3134
03:39:51,480 --> 03:39:56,980
Um, but who I'll grab this.

3135
03:40:02,840 --> 03:40:03,360
Okay.

3136
03:40:04,860 --> 03:40:06,400
Pay extra to get in now?

3137
03:40:09,160 --> 03:40:09,680
Uh...

3138
03:40:10,200 --> 03:40:10,740
It's fine.

3139
03:40:10,860 --> 03:40:11,180
We'll wait.

3140
03:40:11,400 --> 03:40:11,940
I can wait.

3141
03:40:14,600 --> 03:40:15,120
Actually...

3142
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:16,500
Yeah, I can wait.

3143
03:40:18,720 --> 03:40:19,420
That's fine.

3144
03:40:19,600 --> 03:40:20,500
I need to save my money.

3145
03:40:20,580 --> 03:40:21,800
I have the shop right after.

3146
03:40:23,140 --> 03:40:24,400
Yeah, there's no reason to.

3147
03:40:24,520 --> 03:40:26,160
I really have to shop here.

3148
03:40:35,760 --> 03:40:38,660
I'm gonna buy the moon first.

3149
03:40:40,160 --> 03:40:42,500
All right, let's see here.

3150
03:40:43,800 --> 03:40:45,240
Oh, inflicts a curse.

3151
03:41:01,220 --> 03:41:03,120
I'm gonna go down.

3152
03:41:03,320 --> 03:41:04,020
Maybe down?

3153
03:41:06,980 --> 03:41:10,860
Oh, there's no damage to boss.

3154
03:41:11,380 --> 03:41:12,420
Oh, my God.

3155
03:41:15,540 --> 03:41:16,760
This is a pretty bad...

3156
03:41:16,760 --> 03:41:18,060
Oh, I should have went for the minions.

3157
03:41:18,300 --> 03:41:19,960
I should have went for the minions!

3158
03:41:24,660 --> 03:41:25,760
I'll do this.

3159
03:41:32,860 --> 03:41:33,260
Alright.

3160
03:41:33,880 --> 03:41:35,240
The stars align.

3161
03:41:36,520 --> 03:41:38,980
The shrines of Lord Hermes that I've seen around the
surface.

3162
03:41:39,440 --> 03:41:41,360
I noticed they take off rings of gold as well.

3163
03:41:41,960 --> 03:41:43,540
I take it the two of you are back in business then.

3164
03:41:47,600 --> 03:41:48,200
Okay.

3165
03:41:49,880 --> 03:41:50,980
Then may business be good.

3166
03:41:51,260 --> 03:41:51,580
All right.

3167
03:41:53,240 --> 03:41:54,740
Shield or Aphrodite chat.

3168
03:41:55,860 --> 03:41:58,620
Has the black flagship sails closer to the shore?

3169
03:41:59,140 --> 03:42:06,060
The princess of the dead knows well that whatsoever strife
she has experienced thus far this night is about to get

3170
03:42:06,060 --> 03:42:06,540
worse.

3171
03:42:06,760 --> 03:42:06,860
Oh no.

3172
03:42:07,700 --> 03:42:09,020
That sounds pretty bad.

3173
03:42:10,180 --> 03:42:10,900
Shield or Aphrodite.

3174
03:42:11,080 --> 03:42:12,400
I can only afford one.

3175
03:42:14,060 --> 03:42:15,720
God, I've never been this fast before.

3176
03:42:16,100 --> 03:42:16,140
Aphrodite?

3177
03:42:19,540 --> 03:42:20,080
Alright.

3178
03:42:20,960 --> 03:42:27,240
You're both in there has such an ugly job having to smuggle
little blessings such as these into the worst of places.

3179
03:42:28,120 --> 03:42:30,700
But we make it worth his while, don't you worry about that?

3180
03:42:33,800 --> 03:42:34,240
I guess?

3181
03:42:35,480 --> 03:42:35,780
Oh.

3182
03:42:37,160 --> 03:42:37,500
Hmm.

3183
03:42:40,540 --> 03:42:41,080
Mmm.

3184
03:42:46,620 --> 03:42:49,000
I don't want or three.

3185
03:42:49,500 --> 03:42:51,120
We don't have anything on our cast.

3186
03:42:51,260 --> 03:42:52,060
Weak is nice.

3187
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:55,560
Alright.

3188
03:42:55,940 --> 03:42:57,780
We don't have anything on the cast, too.

3189
03:42:59,920 --> 03:43:00,480
So...

3190
03:43:03,670 --> 03:43:04,230
Yeah.

3191
03:43:04,910 --> 03:43:05,370
Alright.

3192
03:43:06,670 --> 03:43:07,230
Alright.

3193
03:43:07,530 --> 03:43:10,490
I might lose a Death Defying Shield, maybe.

3194
03:43:11,390 --> 03:43:13,410
Because I don't have a lot of HP.

3195
03:43:14,190 --> 03:43:15,550
And I don't have the damage to...

3196
03:43:15,550 --> 03:43:16,610
Because she's immune.

3197
03:43:18,670 --> 03:43:22,210
to the quirk of the sheep.

3198
03:43:22,730 --> 03:43:28,510
I can attest he and that bird have come to terms.

3199
03:43:29,250 --> 03:43:30,530
Come on, have pity on me, Aris.

3200
03:43:31,090 --> 03:43:34,670
I have to deal with fire and feathers here and again at the
top of Olympus.

3201
03:43:36,350 --> 03:43:37,990
That is a pretty good appeal, babe.

3202
03:43:38,810 --> 03:43:40,630
But unfortunately for you, I don't have heart.

3203
03:43:40,630 --> 03:43:42,010
Don't call me babe.

3204
03:43:44,890 --> 03:43:46,930
How fucking dare you.

3205
03:43:53,520 --> 03:43:55,140
What the fuck?

3206
03:43:55,780 --> 03:43:56,360
How is that?

3207
03:43:58,300 --> 03:43:59,380
I mean...

3208
03:43:59,380 --> 03:43:59,820
Okay.

3209
03:44:04,480 --> 03:44:05,380
Okay, next fight.

3210
03:44:07,560 --> 03:44:08,100
Alright.

3211
03:44:14,560 --> 03:44:15,580
Oh my god.

3212
03:44:16,000 --> 03:44:16,360
Let's go.

3213
03:44:19,140 --> 03:44:20,260
Wait, where is she?

3214
03:44:21,420 --> 03:44:22,120
It's fine.

3215
03:44:22,200 --> 03:44:23,140
I got sheep, though.

3216
03:44:24,120 --> 03:44:24,780
I got sheep.

3217
03:44:25,900 --> 03:44:26,340
Oh shit!

3218
03:44:26,560 --> 03:44:26,960
Oh shit!

3219
03:44:28,440 --> 03:44:28,820
Here!

3220
03:44:31,660 --> 03:44:32,800
Alright, that's good.

3221
03:44:33,880 --> 03:44:34,680
It's okay.

3222
03:44:35,160 --> 03:44:39,440
It's alright, we're here.

3223
03:44:40,740 --> 03:44:41,840
Okay, that's fine, I guess.

3224
03:44:46,790 --> 03:44:48,290
Maybe I could do something with the sheep?

3225
03:44:51,770 --> 03:44:53,450
What the fuck?

3226
03:44:56,450 --> 03:44:57,030
Where is she?

3227
03:45:00,600 --> 03:45:01,260
There you go.

3228
03:45:01,420 --> 03:45:02,100
I'll stay here.

3229
03:45:06,720 --> 03:45:07,860
All right, that's five.

3230
03:45:10,600 --> 03:45:12,000
That's what the...

3231
03:45:12,000 --> 03:45:13,420
That's what she is for?

3232
03:45:14,180 --> 03:45:14,420
Nope.

3233
03:45:17,860 --> 03:45:19,720
Oh my god, come on.

3234
03:45:28,720 --> 03:45:29,380
Okay, it's five.

3235
03:45:33,600 --> 03:45:36,140
Okay, I just thought maybe...

3236
03:45:36,140 --> 03:45:36,820
I don't know.

3237
03:45:37,980 --> 03:45:40,440
Like, why did you hit her?

3238
03:45:49,670 --> 03:45:50,270
Okay.

3239
03:45:53,290 --> 03:46:12,430
okay that's not cool are you fucking kidding me okay there
you go oh we're fire I did get burned a little bit just just

3240
03:46:12,430 --> 03:46:18,350
a little burn oh I didn't have to use my depth of fines at
least.

3241
03:46:19,010 --> 03:46:21,410
I feel very low HP though.

3242
03:46:21,550 --> 03:46:23,840
I'm not very comfortable with that.

3243
03:46:25,730 --> 03:46:27,250
I don't know.

3244
03:46:29,630 --> 03:46:30,730
I feel like I use... Oh, wait.

3245
03:46:30,750 --> 03:46:31,350
What's this?

3246
03:46:32,170 --> 03:46:32,690
Oh, okay.

3247
03:46:33,350 --> 03:46:34,790
Uh... Nah.

3248
03:46:38,350 --> 03:46:39,730
Okay, we'll grab this.

3249
03:46:41,330 --> 03:46:41,810
Oh.

3250
03:46:43,570 --> 03:46:44,190
Proceed.

3251
03:46:47,870 --> 03:46:48,670
I don't know.

3252
03:46:48,710 --> 03:46:52,870
After having 340 HP, everything feels very low to me.

3253
03:46:54,170 --> 03:46:54,730
Everything.

3254
03:46:56,010 --> 03:46:58,930
It just feels very low after that.

3255
03:46:58,990 --> 03:46:59,950
Like, I don't...

3256
03:46:59,950 --> 03:47:01,250
I can't go back, guys.

3257
03:47:01,970 --> 03:47:03,370
It was so nice.

3258
03:47:04,410 --> 03:47:05,310
It was so nice.

3259
03:47:05,390 --> 03:47:05,770
Oh, hey.

3260
03:47:06,390 --> 03:47:08,770
We got the bomb upgrades, too.

3261
03:47:09,550 --> 03:47:10,190
Oh, yeah, Moon.

3262
03:47:14,340 --> 03:47:15,840
I was too used to being a tank.

3263
03:47:20,320 --> 03:47:21,040
There we go.

3264
03:47:22,480 --> 03:47:23,160
Use that.

3265
03:47:25,140 --> 03:47:29,380
Let's turn you into a sheep real fast and then

3266
03:47:32,540 --> 03:47:33,740
There you go.

3267
03:47:34,020 --> 03:47:34,360
Oh shit.

3268
03:47:34,600 --> 03:47:35,580
There's more of you guys.

3269
03:47:36,200 --> 03:47:36,540
It's okay.

3270
03:47:37,000 --> 03:47:38,020
There's more of sheep

3271
03:47:41,560 --> 03:47:49,860
There you go No, no, no, no, no, no get away from me Oh my
god.

3272
03:47:50,120 --> 03:47:56,980
Oh my god, Eddie called in more people Oh, God, that's so
messed up.

3273
03:48:00,500 --> 03:48:02,240
That's actually so messed up.

3274
03:48:06,100 --> 03:48:06,460
God!

3275
03:48:07,200 --> 03:48:08,180
He's here.

3276
03:48:10,480 --> 03:48:14,940
I mean, I don't know what else to get here.

3277
03:48:15,580 --> 03:48:16,220
Which is better.

3278
03:48:16,800 --> 03:48:18,560
Fuck, I'll just grab the blast.

3279
03:48:20,280 --> 03:48:21,280
Like, it's here anyway.

3280
03:48:22,280 --> 03:48:23,240
Oh, and there's Hammer.

3281
03:48:24,640 --> 03:48:25,160
Nice.

3282
03:48:29,020 --> 03:48:29,620
Alright.

3283
03:48:31,680 --> 03:48:32,720
Nice.

3284
03:48:33,600 --> 03:48:36,940
There you go.

3285
03:48:37,560 --> 03:48:39,280
That's actually very convenient for me.

3286
03:48:43,500 --> 03:48:44,920
If I do it again, though.

3287
03:48:46,860 --> 03:48:47,900
Sheep again!

3288
03:48:48,800 --> 03:48:49,520
That's right!

3289
03:48:51,440 --> 03:48:52,140
Acceptable.

3290
03:48:53,100 --> 03:48:53,420
Alright.

3291
03:48:56,000 --> 03:48:56,520
Oh!

3292
03:49:01,830 --> 03:49:04,890
For my charge, that's really good, right?

3293
03:49:07,050 --> 03:49:08,790
Or plus 30 power.

3294
03:49:09,070 --> 03:49:09,730
One or two.

3295
03:49:12,790 --> 03:49:13,430
Or...

3296
03:49:13,430 --> 03:49:15,330
Yeah, it says it works with Omega.

3297
03:49:16,090 --> 03:49:16,630
It does.

3298
03:49:20,010 --> 03:49:20,330
Two?

3299
03:49:21,030 --> 03:49:21,410
Alright.

3300
03:49:22,810 --> 03:49:23,590
I'm grateful.

3301
03:49:23,610 --> 03:49:24,290
Oh, we have Chaos.

3302
03:49:24,410 --> 03:49:25,670
Is it worth doing Chaos?

3303
03:49:26,290 --> 03:49:27,170
I don't know.

3304
03:49:29,530 --> 03:49:29,850
Okay.

3305
03:49:30,090 --> 03:49:32,610
You guys think it's worth doing chaos?

3306
03:49:33,010 --> 03:49:33,530
This late?

3307
03:49:35,230 --> 03:49:35,970
I'm worried.

3308
03:49:36,130 --> 03:49:37,510
Yeah, this feels way too late.

3309
03:49:43,170 --> 03:49:44,190
It's so risky.

3310
03:49:45,030 --> 03:49:45,450
Room check?

3311
03:49:45,650 --> 03:49:46,430
We're at 37.

3312
03:49:49,110 --> 03:49:51,410
We have six encounters to do.

3313
03:49:54,030 --> 03:49:54,550
Huh.

3314
03:49:58,790 --> 03:50:00,810
Alright, we'll see what it gives us.

3315
03:50:01,650 --> 03:50:02,790
It is kind of risky.

3316
03:50:07,360 --> 03:50:07,920
Okay.

3317
03:50:08,860 --> 03:50:09,460
Hmm...

3318
03:50:10,260 --> 03:50:11,320
All right, let's do it.

3319
03:50:11,700 --> 03:50:12,360
Gamba time!

3320
03:50:14,140 --> 03:50:14,740
Gamba Gamba!

3321
03:50:15,100 --> 03:50:16,320
Oh, and there's extra money.

3322
03:50:18,260 --> 03:50:20,060
I'll pick that up real quick.

3323
03:50:21,400 --> 03:50:26,760
I am familiar with what you recently achieved despite
Typhon's comparative indifference size and strength.

3324
03:50:27,320 --> 03:50:30,940
How interesting are the smallest meanings of how often
proved to be superior?

3325
03:50:31,560 --> 03:50:33,440
Is my conception of strength incorrect?

3326
03:50:41,750 --> 03:50:42,350
Hmm...

3327
03:50:59,160 --> 03:51:09,560
I don't want to use my free will.

3328
03:51:11,580 --> 03:51:13,000
For super DPS?

3329
03:51:15,590 --> 03:51:17,380
That is true.

3330
03:51:17,460 --> 03:51:19,640
I will get a lot of DPS, though.

3331
03:51:21,440 --> 03:51:23,400
All right.

3332
03:51:24,780 --> 03:51:34,020

3335
03:51:58,080 --> 03:51:58,980
Wait, wait, this is fine.

3336
03:51:59,420 --> 03:51:59,420
Watch.

3337
03:51:59,860 --> 03:52:01,020
Because it's sheep time!

3338
03:52:01,980 --> 03:52:04,340
They can't hit me if it's just sheep time!

3339
03:52:06,860 --> 03:52:10,380
If it's always sheep time, they can't hurt me.

3340
03:52:12,380 --> 03:52:13,260
Oh, God.

3341
03:52:13,800 --> 03:52:14,240
Oh, God.

3342
03:52:15,700 --> 03:52:16,240
Oh, God.

3343
03:52:18,140 --> 03:52:19,780
It's always sheep time, guys.

3344
03:52:20,320 --> 03:52:21,720
It's always sheep time.

3345
03:52:22,700 --> 03:52:24,440
Sheep time will save us.

3346
03:52:26,520 --> 03:52:27,540
There you go.

3347
03:52:28,400 --> 03:52:30,560
Oh, yeah, hey, my delivery's here.

3348
03:52:30,780 --> 03:52:31,900
Oh, hey.

03:52:34,700 --> 03:52:35,260
Oh!

03:52:41,770 --> 03:52:42,890
What'd you get two?

3351
03:52:43,330 --> 03:52:43,610

3352
03:52:44,270 --> 03:52:44,790
The duo.

3353
03:52:48,590 --> 03:52:50,590
My M plus 25?

3354
03:52:52,150 --> 03:52:53,270
Okay, um...

3355
03:52:53,270 --> 03:52:56,010
Yeah, I should be able to, right?

3356
03:52:57,370 --> 03:53:01,270

Oh, yeah, free Apollo.

3362
03:53:39,220 --> 03:53:39,560
Oh!

3363
03:53:40,040 --> 03:53:41,260
Inflix days as well.

3364
03:53:42,400 --> 03:53:43,240
It inspects...

3365
03:53:43,240 --> 03:53:44,080
Wait, two!

3366
03:53:44,340 --> 03:53:44,900
Supernova!

3367
03:53:45,220 --> 03:53:46,300
Wait, one or two, chat!

3368
03:53:53,170 --> 03:53:54,870
Oh, wait, I need to fight for chaos.

3369
03:53:54,990 --> 03:53:55,670
Oh, fuck!

3370
03:53:55,730 --> 03:53:56,290
You're right.

3371
03:53:56,950 --> 03:53:57,850
Oh, shit.

3372
03:54:00,110 --> 03:54:01,370
One is Erpel.

3373
03:54:02,230 --> 03:54:02,990
Oh, okay.

3374
03:54:03,550 --> 03:54:04,750
But Erpel, though.

3375
03:54:06,250 --> 03:54:06,810
Oh.

3376
03:54:08,290 --> 03:54:08,850
Oh.

3377
03:54:14,820 --> 03:54:16,180
Wait, this is bad.

3378
03:54:17,200 --> 03:54:18,160
I'm at 40.

3379
03:54:24,600 --> 03:54:25,660
This is bad.

3380
03:54:30,280 --> 03:54:30,840
This...

3381
03:54:30,840 --> 03:54:31,200
Oh.

3382
03:54:32,540 --> 03:54:33,100
Okay.

3383
03:54:34,860 --> 03:54:36,020
I guess more Apollo.

3384
03:54:37,440 --> 03:54:38,560
This is...

3385
03:54:38,560 --> 03:54:40,060
The room was no lot...

3386
03:54:40,060 --> 03:54:41,960
Oh, we did not want a free room.

3387
03:54:42,680 --> 03:54:44,920
Oh, the gamble was a little risky.

3388
03:54:48,970 --> 03:54:49,530
Okay.

3389
03:54:49,550 --> 03:54:51,130
You have sheep.

3390
03:54:51,350 --> 03:54:53,010
You'll be fine.

3391
03:54:55,290 --> 03:54:57,650
Apollo or Aphrodite chat.

3392
03:55:02,110 --> 03:55:02,630
Oh, God.

3393
03:55:02,970 --> 03:55:03,820
This is so bad.

3394
03:55:09,100 --> 03:55:09,440
Okay.

3395
03:55:10,500 --> 03:55:11,360
Oh, please be the dragon.

3396
03:55:11,460 --> 03:55:12,780
Yes, it's the dragon!

3397
03:55:14,480 --> 03:55:14,740
Nice!

3398
03:55:15,820 --> 03:55:17,940
That's actually so good for us.

3399
03:55:18,460 --> 03:55:20,620
Because dragon is sheep!

3400
03:55:21,220 --> 03:55:21,800
Okay.

3401
03:55:26,540 --> 03:55:28,440
Dragon is sheep!

3402
03:55:33,130 --> 03:55:33,830
Sheep tab!

3403
03:55:36,510 --> 03:55:37,410
Oh, thank god.

3404
03:55:39,710 --> 03:55:40,510
Okay.

3405
03:55:47,430 --> 03:55:48,990
Okay, we get a cast expand.

3406
03:55:54,490 --> 03:55:55,890
Cast expand, though.

3407
03:55:57,410 --> 03:56:06,510
Okay, we just have to hope to guide that the next one is is
also an encounter.

3408
03:56:07,170 --> 03:56:08,690
We just gotta...

3409
03:56:12,370 --> 03:56:16,150
I am very scared right now, guys.

3410
03:56:16,550 --> 03:56:19,070
I am very scared.

3411
03:56:25,210 --> 03:56:26,510
Alright, nice.

3412
03:56:29,670 --> 03:56:32,350
Jesus, okay, I better get...

3413
03:56:32,350 --> 03:56:34,310
Athena might be... Oh my god!

3414
03:56:34,590 --> 03:56:35,590
Oh my god!

3415
03:56:41,710 --> 03:56:45,170
Oh, this is very bad, everyone.

3416
03:56:46,490 --> 03:56:47,310
Okay, there you go.

3417
03:56:47,770 --> 03:56:50,110
I was gonna say, she better show up here.

3418
03:56:50,770 --> 03:56:52,570
There's a lot of people.

3419
03:56:56,910 --> 03:56:58,410
Oh, she did.

3420
03:56:58,510 --> 03:57:01,610
I had a feeling because there was way too many people coming
in.

3421
03:57:05,830 --> 03:57:06,350
Uh...

3422
03:57:08,210 --> 03:57:09,250
Give me...

3423
03:57:09,250 --> 03:57:10,070
One or two.

3424
03:57:10,150 --> 03:57:10,490
One or two.

3425
03:57:10,510 --> 03:57:15,730
I don't think I should invest in three only because It's not
gonna be good for endgame.

3426
03:57:15,930 --> 03:57:16,170
Yeah.

3427
03:57:16,650 --> 03:57:17,030
One?

3428
03:57:17,850 --> 03:57:18,930
All right, I'll go one.

3429
03:57:19,170 --> 03:57:20,410
I see one person said one.

3430
03:57:20,530 --> 03:57:21,490
I was like, you're right, one.

3431
03:57:22,010 --> 03:57:23,170
Have I gifted her yet?

3432
03:57:29,050 --> 03:57:31,710
Oh, I don't have anything to gift you anyway.

3433
03:57:32,930 --> 03:57:33,610
I can't even gift.

3434
03:57:33,970 --> 03:57:34,530
I can't even gift.

3435
03:57:35,530 --> 03:57:35,750
I can't even gift.

3436
03:57:35,750 --> 03:57:38,630
A clever ploy for Kronos to set such a thing on us.

3437
03:57:39,110 --> 03:57:41,430
Keeping us occupied while he plots his next move.

3438
03:57:43,650 --> 03:57:45,990
Whether clever or reckless, I'm not yet convinced.

3439
03:57:46,650 --> 03:57:52,330
Kronos is counting on Typhon turning all his violence
against Olympus, but after that, I'm actually getting the

3440
03:57:52,330 --> 03:57:59,190
craziest luck I feel like I'm fucking bumping into everyone
Perhaps Kronos means to seal the monster away once we are no

3441
03:57:59,190 --> 03:58:00,970
longer a threat at any rate.

3442
03:58:01,170 --> 03:58:10,370
We don't intend to let any such outcome transpire All right
Oh

3443
03:58:17,100 --> 03:58:22,420
Oh, wait divine dash nice That's actually what we needed
Okay.

3444
03:58:22,880 --> 03:58:23,640
Oh my god, thank god.

3445
03:58:23,980 --> 03:58:23,980
Okay.

3446
03:58:25,100 --> 03:58:25,420
Alright.

3447
03:58:26,340 --> 03:58:27,680
Time for, uh, palm tab.

3448
03:58:28,720 --> 03:58:28,980
Okay.

3449
03:58:31,580 --> 03:58:32,580
That's good, that's good.

3450
03:58:32,680 --> 03:58:33,500
We actually made it.

3451
03:58:33,700 --> 03:58:34,940
Guys, we actually made it.

3452
03:58:36,780 --> 03:58:38,280
That chest is so good for us.

3453
03:58:48,920 --> 03:58:50,180
Oh my god, thank god.

3454
03:58:50,420 --> 03:58:52,840
Thank actual, thank god, moment right there.

3455
03:58:54,440 --> 03:58:55,320
Got worried.

3456
03:58:58,460 --> 03:58:58,900
Yeah!

3457
03:58:59,940 --> 03:59:02,140
Oh my god, okay, that's fine.

3458
03:59:04,540 --> 03:59:05,100
Sheep.

3459
03:59:06,120 --> 03:59:09,000
Okay, one last sheep for the ride.

3460
03:59:12,990 --> 03:59:13,550
Goodness.

3461
03:59:14,750 --> 03:59:15,490
More sheep.

3462
03:59:16,850 --> 03:59:17,410
More sheep.

3463
03:59:18,570 --> 03:59:18,770
Yeah.

3464
03:59:19,430 --> 03:59:20,010
Oh, yeah.

3465
03:59:20,250 --> 03:59:20,730
Just took hold.

3466
03:59:21,170 --> 03:59:23,830
Finally got the shield, too.

3467
03:59:25,550 --> 03:59:26,390
Oh, thank God.

3468
03:59:27,170 --> 03:59:28,350
Oh, thank God.

3469
03:59:28,450 --> 03:59:30,250
I don't even remember what I did it for.

3470
03:59:32,150 --> 03:59:33,230
What's the prize?

3471
03:59:34,170 --> 03:59:34,610
Oh, attacks.

3472
03:59:34,730 --> 03:59:35,690
It makes my attack stronger.

3473
03:59:36,330 --> 03:59:37,590

04:14:37,990 --> 04:14:40,290
To all my family on the mountain.

3653
04:14:40,830 --> 04:14:41,370
Let me pass

3654
04:14:45,300 --> 04:14:54,700
Oh my victory palms zero deaths to You forgot about last
night monster hits different coming from Zeus.

3655
04:14:54,920 --> 04:14:56,740
Keita thank you for the super chat.

3656
04:14:56,960 --> 04:15:11,260
Thank you, bro I won't be surprised if Zeus fuck the fucking
King of monsters We did it guys whoa flower oh my good niece

3657
04:15:11,260 --> 04:15:19,500
you were extraordinary truly so far as we can tell no trace
of that monstrosity remains the deed is done typhon is dead

3658
04:15:19,500 --> 04:15:28,140
we saved olympus so what do can i live in olympus now my
lord husband has been premature to declare victory before so

3659
04:15:28,140 --> 04:15:34,480
i shall not believe a word of this until i hear it from your
lips oh what a very lovely healthy relationship that you two

3660
04:15:34,480 --> 04:15:44,480
have the father of all monsters is undone not merely dead
but eradicated using the power of the time no no you're

3661
04:15:44,480 --> 04:15:54,300
gonna say it hell for the locker building you hear that
herodia I told you young men and we was certain to prevail

3662
04:15:54,300 --> 04:16:04,980
our family always triumphs when we stand together with a
common purpose I remain utterly in shock well now girl if

3663
04:16:04,980 --> 04:16:10,940
you have truly quashed that monstrous threat Then do prepare
yourself for all of us to claim we never doubted you at any

3664
04:16:10,940 --> 04:16:11,220
point.

3665
04:16:11,760 --> 04:16:18,580
My lord husband is already starting If you had not believed
in me Queen Hara then perhaps Typhon would have been here in

3666
04:16:18,580 --> 04:16:22,880
my stead So thank you all and now an even greater victory is
within.

3667
04:16:22,980 --> 04:16:23,340
Oh my god.

3668
04:16:23,400 --> 04:16:24,120
We're getting close.

3669
04:16:24,260 --> 04:16:32,260
We're getting so close There's only one last run if I make
it one last run Using a method you employed this very night

3670
04:16:33,800 --> 04:16:40,080
If necessary though this power that you witnessed was for
Typhon and And likewise, what we plan for Kronos is fit only

3671
04:16:40,080 --> 04:16:40,460
for him.

3672
04:16:41,220 --> 04:16:45,300
The Deathless cannot be destroyed unless they threaten the
very fabric of the weavings of the fates.

3673
04:16:46,840 --> 04:16:49,320
No time for feasting till the other deed is done, then, yes?

3674
04:16:49,740 --> 04:16:50,300
That's fine.

3675
04:16:50,720 --> 04:16:54,920
The Titan's forces may grow far more desperate now, a
possibility for which we ought prepare.

3676
04:16:55,320 --> 04:16:58,980
We shall lend you all the strength we can for your own final
assault.

3677
04:16:59,360 --> 04:17:00,040
Oh, thank God.

3678
04:17:00,180 --> 04:17:01,220
They're actually going to help me?

3679
04:17:01,940 --> 04:17:02,380
For real?

3680
04:17:03,900 --> 04:17:04,820
They're actually... Real?

3681
04:17:05,000 --> 04:17:05,360
Beware.

3682
04:17:07,340 --> 04:17:11,900
That monster turned the weather such that not even Lord Zeus
or I could stop it properly.

3683
04:17:12,580 --> 04:17:15,200
But now he's gone, and we have you to thank.

3684
04:17:17,060 --> 04:17:17,520
As we!

3685
04:17:17,960 --> 04:17:18,800
As we all around, Grandmother.

3686
04:17:19,480 --> 04:17:21,580
Typhon gave in to the combined might of the gods.

3687
04:17:22,220 --> 04:17:23,980
I merely concentrated our foul strength.

3688
04:17:24,900 --> 04:17:26,160
Now to press this advantage.

3689
04:17:29,860 --> 04:17:32,720
Bro, Melody, you gotta stop fucking giving them credit.

3690
04:17:32,980 --> 04:17:34,000
What did they do?

3691
04:17:34,080 --> 04:17:35,440
Who slurs one thunderbolt?

3692
04:17:35,540 --> 04:17:37,120
That's not might of all gods.

3693
04:17:37,340 --> 04:17:40,440
Perhaps not even Kronos can withstand what you unleashed.

3694
04:17:40,840 --> 04:17:41,700
It's all you, girl.

3695
04:17:42,940 --> 04:17:44,920
Make certain we shall meet again.

3696
04:17:46,080 --> 04:17:46,900
We will.

3697
04:17:48,580 --> 04:17:49,060
I know.

3698
04:17:49,380 --> 04:17:50,380
We did it.

3699
04:17:50,580 --> 04:17:51,180
You got him.

3700
04:17:51,480 --> 04:17:52,520
Yeah, it's me.

3701
04:17:52,780 --> 04:17:55,020
Not that my faith in you wavered since your initial victory.

3702
04:17:55,220 --> 04:17:56,000
It's just...

3703
04:17:56,000 --> 04:17:57,660
I still can't entirely believe it.

3704
04:17:58,180 --> 04:17:59,260
So now for Kronos, then.

3705
04:18:00,000 --> 04:18:00,840
They're giving you...

3706
04:18:00,840 --> 04:18:02,020
I have to pay for it.

3707
04:18:02,040 --> 04:18:02,540
What the...

3708
04:18:04,820 --> 04:18:05,640
Yeah, yeah.

3709
04:18:05,900 --> 04:18:07,000
Giving me boo.

3710
04:18:09,400 --> 04:18:11,340
They charged me for boo.

3711
04:18:12,860 --> 04:18:14,340
I'm certain you could use it.

3712
04:18:18,930 --> 04:18:23,090
With Prometheus and such still causing problems, we won't be
getting all too comfortable just yet.

3713
04:18:23,970 --> 04:18:25,650
Especially not while our main foes out there still.

3714
04:18:26,250 --> 04:18:27,010
Go get him sunshine.

3715
04:18:29,470 --> 04:18:30,950
Alright, here we go.

3716
04:18:31,450 --> 04:18:32,150
Should help you get home.

3717
04:18:32,990 --> 04:18:35,830
Wait, if I kill Typhon, who the fuck replaces him?

3718
04:18:35,950 --> 04:18:37,550
If I do another surface run.

3719
04:18:37,630 --> 04:18:38,990
I'll be counting on your blessings, everyone.

3720
04:18:40,430 --> 04:18:49,470
actually kill him later return to shadow now don't worry
this relation is bad Zeus has like 20 other wise thank you

one way to find out smile I got brood real quick guys are

3725
04:19:23,450 --> 04:19:27,350

3726
04:19:30,770 --> 04:19:36,370
it's typhoon there that's not typhoon it's typhoon there
it's tyrone

3727
04:19:40,790 --> 04:19:43,050
i know i can count on you.

3728
04:19:43,710 --> 04:19:44,770
I'll provide the materials.

3729
04:19:45,190 --> 04:19:46,490
You'll be the main point of contact.

3730
04:19:50,230 --> 04:19:50,970
Okay, fine.

3731
04:19:51,670 --> 04:19:52,550
El Typhon.

3732
04:19:53,510 --> 04:19:54,290
El Typhon.

3733
04:19:55,710 --> 04:19:59,090
To your success, it's true, isn't it?

3734
04:19:59,630 --> 04:20:01,770
You scoured Typhon from this world.

3735
04:20:02,190 --> 04:20:04,590
He's the uncle of all monsters.

3736
04:20:05,030 --> 04:20:07,670
Not me have been about his reawakening, but his eradication.

3737
04:20:08,510 --> 04:20:10,170
How did you manage this, if I may ask?

3738
04:20:12,230 --> 04:20:15,990
complicated incantation from headmistress alongside the
essence of Guygaros.

3739
04:20:16,390 --> 04:20:19,150
My father's spear he took up after Kronos' vest was
overthrown.

3740
04:20:19,710 --> 04:20:20,630
It all worked out.

3741
04:20:22,370 --> 04:20:28,510
Your father's spear in what I saw a spear could be seen
piercing through the storm.

3742
04:20:28,710 --> 04:20:29,390
That's me!

3743
04:20:31,250 --> 04:20:32,530
Thank you for the super chat.

3744
04:20:32,650 --> 04:20:32,810
Thank you.

3745
04:20:33,070 --> 04:20:33,110
Thank you.

3746
04:20:33,110 --> 04:20:33,230
Thank you.

3747
04:20:33,230 --> 04:20:34,230
Good morning from Germany.

3748
04:20:34,390 --> 04:20:35,010
Good luck, donkey.

3749
04:20:35,190 --> 04:20:35,730
Thank you!

3750
04:20:35,950 --> 04:20:38,930
We are going to complete our first game of 2026.

3751
04:20:39,450 --> 04:20:41,610
Do they anticipate I shall slay Kronos next?

3752
04:20:42,370 --> 04:20:44,970
I'm gonna pick up trash, trash, trash, trash.

3753
04:20:45,290 --> 04:20:46,970
I stockpile so much trash.

3754
04:20:48,770 --> 04:20:51,930
Aris, you said before that I don't even know what I'm
missing.

3755
04:20:52,790 --> 04:20:53,950
What did you mean by that?

3756
04:20:56,290 --> 04:20:58,270
Didn't mean your family, that's for sure.

3757
04:20:58,830 --> 04:21:00,090
Come on, look at yourself.

3758
04:21:00,390 --> 04:21:01,950
You've never lived a day in your life.

3759
04:21:02,310 --> 04:21:05,430
That heart beating in your chest, you think it's only there
to pump your blood.

3760
04:21:05,930 --> 04:21:06,850
Just another muscle.

3761
04:21:08,050 --> 04:21:09,530
The heart is a muscle.

3762
04:21:09,710 --> 04:21:10,070
Yeah.

3763
04:21:10,510 --> 04:21:10,990
Stupid.

3764
04:21:11,990 --> 04:21:14,710
When Olympus is in peril in the underworld and out of
disarray.

3765
04:21:16,090 --> 04:21:16,610
Maybe.

3766
04:21:17,290 --> 04:21:21,630
But you just want everything nice and orderly and
predictable and boring.

3767
04:21:23,330 --> 04:21:25,090
I mean, that's fine.

3768
04:21:25,430 --> 04:21:26,090
I mean, I'm okay.

3769
04:21:26,490 --> 04:21:27,990
Oh my god, is this...

3770
04:21:28,750 --> 04:21:29,590
Wait, decorate.

3771
04:21:29,910 --> 04:21:31,410
What shall it be, witch?

3772
04:21:31,530 --> 04:21:32,050
Oh!

3773
04:21:33,690 --> 04:21:35,330
I couldn't decorate this place.

3774
04:21:35,370 --> 04:21:36,830
I'm not decorating this for you guys.

3775
04:21:36,970 --> 04:21:37,710
I am not.

3776
04:21:39,450 --> 04:21:41,030
Return from online.

3777
04:21:41,990 --> 04:21:43,110
Oh my god, finally.

3778
04:21:45,630 --> 04:21:46,790
We can make it.

3779
04:21:47,370 --> 04:21:47,390
We can proceed.

3780
04:21:47,950 --> 04:21:51,150
Time overstepped his bounds, which cannot stand.

3781
04:21:51,570 --> 04:21:54,830
He shall be stopped as the three fates had planned.

3782
04:22:00,690 --> 04:22:01,990
Death to Kronos.

3783
04:22:02,210 --> 04:22:04,870
We're finally actually doing death to Kronos.

3784
04:22:05,170 --> 04:22:06,370
Oh, can I decorate my room?

3785
04:22:06,770 --> 04:22:07,350
Oh, I can.

3786
04:22:09,950 --> 04:22:10,550
Kronos.

3787
04:22:10,730 --> 04:22:11,970
What do I do with Kronos?

3788
04:22:13,270 --> 04:22:16,010
Boy, I want better bedding, though.

3789
04:22:16,450 --> 04:22:17,410
Let's make it happen.

3790
04:22:17,890 --> 04:22:17,970
Sure.

3791
04:22:18,950 --> 04:22:19,310
Yay!

3792
04:22:20,150 --> 04:22:21,670
I get a real bed now.

3793
04:22:23,210 --> 04:22:23,490
Yeah!

3794
04:22:28,250 --> 04:22:29,370
And then...

3795
04:22:29,370 --> 04:22:29,830
I don't know.

3796
04:22:29,950 --> 04:22:30,410
I'm getting something fine.

3797
04:22:30,490 --> 04:22:31,070
That's all I want.

3798
04:22:31,350 --> 04:22:32,610
I just want an actual bed.

3799
04:22:42,350 --> 04:22:42,910
Oh, okay.

3800
04:22:43,190 --> 04:22:44,370
I can finally recycle.

3801
04:22:44,790 --> 04:22:45,430
I'm a musky truck son.

3802
04:22:47,130 --> 04:22:48,230
Carefully said.

3803
04:22:49,790 --> 04:22:52,590
Oh my god, I can finally fucking recycle now.

3804
04:22:55,290 --> 04:22:56,410
Surge of fresh air.

3805
04:22:56,570 --> 04:22:58,290
Oh wait, actually I can make...

3806
04:22:58,290 --> 04:22:59,010
Oh, did I already make it?

3807
04:22:59,170 --> 04:22:59,590
Oh, I already did.

3808
04:23:04,460 --> 04:23:05,360
Oh wait, what?

3809
04:23:12,810 --> 04:23:14,130
Wait, what does this mean?

3810
04:23:19,030 --> 04:23:20,030
What does that mean?

3811
04:23:20,610 --> 04:23:21,690
What move is that?

3812
04:23:23,150 --> 04:23:28,130
Oh my god, I can fucking finally...

3813
04:23:29,470 --> 04:23:30,870
Get rid of that shit.

3814
04:23:37,280 --> 04:23:37,740
Oh.

3815
04:23:39,260 --> 04:23:40,480
Make Kronos weak to slow.

3816
04:23:40,520 --> 04:23:41,260
Oh, okay.

3817
04:23:41,580 --> 04:23:42,400
I have enough for that.

3818
04:23:43,640 --> 04:23:45,460
Guys, I don't have enough for that.

3819
04:23:45,860 --> 04:23:46,560
What the fuck?

3820
04:23:46,800 --> 04:23:47,340
I'm broke?

3821
04:23:48,940 --> 04:23:50,260
I mean, I could sell this.

3822
04:23:52,120 --> 04:23:53,080
Do I have just enough?

3823
04:23:54,960 --> 04:23:56,180
Oh, I just have enough.

3824
04:23:56,320 --> 04:23:57,080
Oh, thank God.

3825
04:23:58,580 --> 04:23:59,320
Just in case.

3826
04:24:01,060 --> 04:24:02,580
Oh, I can decorate this as well.

3827
04:24:07,540 --> 04:24:09,760
Uh, we'll grab this.

3828
04:24:12,520 --> 04:24:13,480
You have it now.

3829
04:24:13,500 --> 04:24:15,840
Time cannot be withstood, not even by itself.

3830
04:24:17,980 --> 04:24:18,180
Yeah!

3831
04:24:21,100 --> 04:24:24,220
Oh, thank god, I just, just able to afford it.

3832
04:24:26,260 --> 04:24:28,200
Wait, what are your stuff do I have in here?

3833
04:24:29,040 --> 04:24:30,340
Spreading of ashes.

3834
04:24:31,840 --> 04:24:32,880
I mean, it doesn't really matter.

3835
04:24:37,860 --> 04:24:38,660
Full grown.

3836
04:24:38,960 --> 04:24:39,740
Yeah, I have olives.

3837
04:24:42,180 --> 04:24:42,640
And soon.

3838
04:24:47,740 --> 04:24:48,940
I can't even do with olives.

3839
04:24:52,520 --> 04:24:52,880
Okay.

3840
04:24:54,420 --> 04:24:54,820
Okay.

3841
04:25:00,070 --> 04:25:00,570
Oh.

3842
04:25:01,170 --> 04:25:01,530
Oh, all right.

3843
04:25:02,890 --> 04:25:04,630
The foul deed is done.

3844
04:25:05,050 --> 04:25:06,650
Potentially last run.

3845
04:25:07,330 --> 04:25:10,950
Gratitude for yielding his power in his absence.

3846
04:25:12,710 --> 04:25:14,490
Ready for the final phase.

3847
04:25:14,630 --> 04:25:15,370
Oh my god.

3848
04:25:15,650 --> 04:25:16,110
It's time.

3849
04:25:17,270 --> 04:25:19,290
My brother has something I didn't know how to answer.

3850
04:25:20,010 --> 04:25:23,470
If Kronos is destroyed before all this, what exactly happens
to us?

3851
04:25:23,470 --> 04:25:24,750
What do I add that, too?

3852
04:25:25,410 --> 04:25:26,850
I was like, don't we cease to exist?

3853
04:25:27,130 --> 04:25:28,050
The truth of it together.

3854
04:25:28,750 --> 04:25:31,470
I am certain only that this is not goodbye.

3855
04:25:32,130 --> 04:25:33,890
The conclusion of your task is...

3856
04:25:33,890 --> 04:25:35,390
Does that mean I'll have my real hand back?

3857
04:25:36,090 --> 04:25:37,010
I have my real eyes?

3858
04:25:39,270 --> 04:25:40,590
I'll see you again soon.

3859
04:25:43,650 --> 04:25:51,310
hey they're saying you got rid of typhon for good don't
believe a word of it what really happened up there got rid

3860
04:25:51,310 --> 04:25:57,390
of typhon for good is a concise way to put it involved a
rather yeah guys they keep telling me i got rid of him for

3861
04:25:57,390 --> 04:26:06,410
good guys details best left unspoken i guess you see el
typhone uncle of all monsters he's immortal he can't just

3862
04:26:06,410 --> 04:26:09,330
yeah oh wait what if he is why not just do the

3863
04:26:12,710 --> 04:26:19,990
long enough but they told me he's gone we've something else
in store for Kronos as for everybody else they haven't

3864
04:26:19,990 --> 04:26:30,030
crossed me quite as much just yet what they said he's all
gone my instinct is to celebrate the death of Typhon but I

3865
04:26:30,030 --> 04:26:39,170
never forgot the first man I slew or the light left his eyes
Typhon sought destruction and he got it I won't rejoice in

3866
04:26:39,170 --> 04:26:45,650
the outcome but won't lament it either especially when
there's more left to be done you have the right approach

3867
04:26:45,650 --> 04:26:51,550
you'll have time to recount every choice and consequence
when all of this is over but for now best to press on and

3868
04:26:51,550 --> 04:27:05,070
finish what you started all right i intend to it's finally
time death to cronos death to cronos let's go i can store

3869
04:27:05,070 --> 04:27:14,670
different arrangements of arcana now it's finally death to
crone okay let's see all

3870
04:27:18,250 --> 04:27:29,220
right what should we upgrade chat what would be the best
upgrade i have three left we're gonna use one will i upgrade

3871
04:27:29,220 --> 04:27:34,180
one of them what do you think is the best for the last one

3872
04:27:39,700 --> 04:27:46,520
all the speed which one's that wayward sun which one's this
one

3873
04:27:51,440 --> 04:27:57,040
all right so that's it That's it.

3874
04:28:00,190 --> 04:28:01,820
I grab the Zeus.

3875
04:28:03,000 --> 04:28:04,340
I can decorate this too.

3876
04:28:05,420 --> 04:28:06,420
You got it.

3877
04:28:11,780 --> 04:28:12,620
That's me.

3878
04:28:13,760 --> 04:28:16,000
Commander, what is the consensus here about Prometheus?

3879
04:28:16,720 --> 04:28:21,640
If some mortals venerated him, perhaps you and your
disciples feel conflicted that he now opposes us.

3880
04:28:23,560 --> 04:28:26,860
The Titan who brought fire, reason, good eats and the arts.

3881
04:28:26,880 --> 04:28:34,860
and stuff the mortal kind then face the vengeance of the
gods for all of that can't stand the guy let him have it

3882
04:28:34,860 --> 04:28:43,680
what that seems like good things that seems like pretty good
things even though he did so much yeah i was gonna say yeah

3883
04:28:43,680 --> 04:28:52,840
i was like wait what's the what's the bad side let's see has
he been nice to you or has he tried to kill you so what have

3884
04:28:52,840 --> 04:28:55,640
we butted Yeah, clearly he's a very bad guy.

3885
04:28:55,700 --> 04:28:57,260
How dare he give me good food?

3886
04:28:57,660 --> 04:28:58,640
Fuck that shit.

3887
04:28:58,920 --> 04:29:00,820
I'll argue what the gods want me to eat.

3888
04:29:02,340 --> 04:29:03,740
For the gods.

3889
04:29:05,740 --> 04:29:06,260
Alright.

3890
04:29:08,720 --> 04:29:11,620
Should we do money or Zeus chat?

3891
04:29:13,460 --> 04:29:16,480
I feel I get less money in the underworld.

3892
04:29:16,720 --> 04:29:17,500
That's why I don't know.

3893
04:29:18,020 --> 04:29:18,740
What do you guys say?

3894
04:29:19,720 --> 04:29:22,480
Because in the past we went with the money, the gold purse.

3895
04:29:23,540 --> 04:29:25,020
But Zeus has been working.

3896
04:29:25,140 --> 04:29:25,920
He has been.

3897
04:29:26,120 --> 04:29:27,020
All right, we'll go with Zeus.

3898
04:29:28,740 --> 04:29:30,700
If he ain't broke, don't fix it.

3899
04:29:30,820 --> 04:29:31,640
You're right.

3900
04:29:33,920 --> 04:29:34,800
For my family.

3901
04:29:36,440 --> 04:29:39,540
Ah, your journey begins anew again, young lady.

3902
04:29:40,260 --> 04:29:44,080
Though let's see how it goes for you when you have my
incomparable blessing from the start.

3903
04:29:44,100 --> 04:29:45,160
All right, here we go.

3904
04:29:46,060 --> 04:29:49,040
I haven't done this one in a fucking long time.

3905
04:29:49,100 --> 04:29:50,560
Oh my gosh, just get that one again.

3906
04:29:51,740 --> 04:29:52,700
I'll ratify it.

3907
04:29:53,260 --> 04:29:53,980
do special.

3908
04:30:04,660 --> 04:30:05,540
Alright, update.

3909
04:30:06,160 --> 04:30:07,540
May I get an alter it?

3910
04:30:07,720 --> 04:30:08,220
No thanks.

3911
04:30:12,760 --> 04:30:13,340
Okay.

3912
04:30:14,760 --> 04:30:15,880
That's okay.

3913
04:30:18,560 --> 04:30:18,980
Sure.

3914
04:30:19,640 --> 04:30:21,800
Just share, I guess.

3915
04:30:24,960 --> 04:30:25,720
Yeah, yeah.

3916
04:30:29,680 --> 04:30:30,340
Hammer.

3917
04:30:32,080 --> 04:30:32,640
Oh.

3918
04:30:32,720 --> 04:30:46,960
one last sheet for the ride if we get the sheet if we're
lucky enough oh my god this area feels so much nicer it's in

3919
04:30:46,960 --> 04:30:48,520

3922
04:31:20,260 --> 04:31:23,180
I really need a 3-gen.

3923
04:31:27,980 --> 04:31:32,260
But I'm freewheeling it!

3924
04:31:33,500 --> 04:31:35,040
Arachne was here.

3925
04:31:36,040 --> 04:31:38,420
What the fuck?

3926
04:31:38,560 --> 04:31:39,640
She's laughing at me.

3927
04:31:41,140 --> 04:31:43,740
Oh, why are you laughing at me?

3928
04:31:46,520 --> 04:31:47,360
Oh, there it is.

3929
04:31:49,300 --> 04:32:02,880
to transform it it's fine it's fine it's you as me so then
the gods above are helping you aren't they so why do i even

3930
04:32:02,880 --> 04:32:09,700
ask you probably want to transform oh i see these woods
light up with all their multicolored messages oh i should

3931
04:32:09,700 --> 04:32:17,300
went for the boss fight i feel like i'd rather get the pump
because i always wasted it i should have told you it's just

3932
04:32:17,300 --> 04:32:18,840
i didn't know what to say

3933
04:32:24,970 --> 04:32:34,070
so the fate's got me again I may be a better weaver than all
the gods combined but those three beat me every time so

3934
04:32:34,070 --> 04:32:39,770

will benefit oh

3939
04:33:37,490 --> 04:33:37,750
Alright.

3940
04:33:49,500 --> 04:33:50,760
Alright, one or two, chat.

3941
04:33:56,260 --> 04:33:58,200
I think it was the first time I ever fought that three?

3942
04:34:01,360 --> 04:34:02,880
You think that'll be worth it?

3943
04:34:06,880 --> 04:34:08,620
Is that worth it?

3944
04:34:09,300 --> 04:34:11,140
I mean, purple is a pre...

3945
04:34:11,140 --> 04:34:12,100
Okay, I'll try it.

3946
04:34:12,220 --> 04:34:14,240
I can finish too.

3947
04:34:14,580 --> 04:34:16,220
Can't hide from me.

3948
04:34:19,960 --> 04:34:23,220
The shadow of a skulking killer now is gone.

3949
04:34:24,000 --> 04:34:29,040
Presumably after it drifted from the crumbling of Vera
streets in search here of a target.

3950
04:34:29,900 --> 04:34:31,420
That cutthroat came to me.

3951
04:34:31,860 --> 04:34:34,220
Yeah, I've never fought- I feel like I've never fought that
guy before.

3952
04:34:34,380 --> 04:34:37,280
Oh hey, oh my god are you gonna- These wretches were
nothing.

3953
04:34:38,160 --> 04:34:39,480
Back when we used to spar.

3954
04:34:40,140 --> 04:34:42,000
Almost never got a clean hit in on you.

3955
04:34:42,540 --> 04:34:44,120
You'd always slip out of the way.

3956
04:34:45,620 --> 04:34:46,440
What choice did I have?

3957
04:34:47,120 --> 04:34:49,480
One clean hit from you was more than I could take back then.

3958
04:34:49,600 --> 04:34:50,860
Yeah, I'm stronger now.

3959
04:34:50,960 --> 04:34:51,740
I got better.

3960
04:34:52,900 --> 04:34:54,020
You're tougher, yeah.

3961
04:34:54,640 --> 04:34:55,740
Though by how much?

3962
04:34:56,440 --> 04:34:58,460
Oh, you're literally fighting in level one.

3963
04:34:58,780 --> 04:35:00,060
That ain't a flex, girl.

3964
04:35:02,580 --> 04:35:02,820
Huh?

3965
04:35:06,680 --> 04:35:07,160
Sure.

3966
04:35:08,360 --> 04:35:12,040
Bro, your best hit is 13.

3967
04:35:12,220 --> 04:35:15,120
Damage she really wants to hit me.

3968
04:35:15,220 --> 04:35:17,860
She That's so sad.

3969
04:35:18,280 --> 04:35:19,420
I mean, I'll take it.

3970
04:35:19,500 --> 04:35:23,240
My pleasure Oh my guys my armor.

3971
04:35:24,000 --> 04:35:24,800
Okay, that's fine.

3972
04:35:25,540 --> 04:35:27,240
It's not it didn't even hit me hit me.

3973
04:35:27,320 --> 04:35:31,800
It was my armor That's still oh, okay.

3974
04:35:32,040 --> 04:35:32,240
It's okay.

3975
04:35:32,260 --> 04:35:36,260
I didn't want the money anyway She didn't even actually hit
me.

3976
04:35:36,500 --> 04:35:47,060
That's the saddest part I should I should just go and chat
Because, like, it's super strong right now, I forgot.

3977
04:35:49,460 --> 04:35:49,820
Damn.

3978
04:35:54,580 --> 04:35:56,160
I'll go for a palm.

3979
04:35:57,860 --> 04:36:00,200
Her muscles are performative, yeah.

3980
04:36:01,160 --> 04:36:02,180
I agree.

3981
04:36:04,600 --> 04:36:06,360
It's actually sad.

3982
04:36:07,860 --> 04:36:09,560
Like, it's just sad now.

3983
04:36:18,340 --> 04:36:19,640
I think that's all of it.

3984
04:36:22,280 --> 04:36:23,340
Be again at peace.

3985
04:36:23,960 --> 04:36:27,840
One or two, chat.

3986
04:36:29,680 --> 04:36:31,080
It's palm tab.

3987
04:36:37,440 --> 04:36:38,000
What?

3988
04:36:38,800 --> 04:36:39,900
The underworld's power.

3989
04:36:41,540 --> 04:36:44,360
I feel like I've, like, given everyone nectar already.

3990
04:36:44,680 --> 04:36:45,340
But I don't have...

3991
04:36:45,340 --> 04:36:47,080
I have no use for ash.

3992
04:36:53,360 --> 04:36:54,440
That's the only thing.

3993
04:36:54,500 --> 04:36:56,180
I have no use for ash right now.

3994
04:37:10,700 --> 04:37:13,180
There you go.

3995
04:37:14,420 --> 04:37:14,980
Nice.

3996
04:37:15,460 --> 04:37:16,020
Nectar.

3997
04:37:16,640 --> 04:37:17,520
Why is this area?

3998
04:37:17,640 --> 04:37:18,680
This area is new.

3999
04:37:19,660 --> 04:37:21,240
I've never seen this room before.

4000
04:37:21,700 --> 04:37:23,500
To be unseen is to become as missed.

4001
04:37:26,160 --> 04:37:27,200
Oh my god, I ran out.

4002
04:37:28,980 --> 04:37:30,280
Okay, this is bad.

4003
04:37:30,900 --> 04:37:32,500
I really need mana regen.

4004
04:37:32,720 --> 04:37:33,480
I just realized.

4005
04:37:38,180 --> 04:37:40,060
Oh, this is so bad for me.

4006
04:37:40,420 --> 04:37:40,940
Actually.

4007
04:37:47,750 --> 04:37:50,510
Okay, let's hope everything will be fine.

4008
04:37:55,720 --> 04:37:56,820
Alright, nice.

4009
04:37:57,420 --> 04:37:57,860
Last guy.

4010
04:37:58,100 --> 04:37:58,720
Stay where you are.

4011
04:37:59,380 --> 04:38:00,200
Stay here!

4012
04:38:04,440 --> 04:38:06,440
Uh, I guess we're in Blitz.

4013
04:38:07,620 --> 04:38:09,880
Uh, is this the last room or not?

4014
04:38:10,840 --> 04:38:11,260
Chat.

4015
04:38:12,200 --> 04:38:13,240
I can't tell.

4016
04:38:16,240 --> 04:38:17,800
Is this the last room?

4017
04:38:18,200 --> 04:38:19,140
It's been a while.

4018
04:38:19,860 --> 04:38:20,780
We're here.

4019
04:38:22,580 --> 04:38:24,080
Because I can just go to the store now.

4020
04:38:25,300 --> 04:38:25,540
No?

4021
04:38:26,160 --> 04:38:28,620
Should I just go to Apollos, uh, Hermes then?

4022
04:38:30,860 --> 04:38:31,760
It is?

4023
04:38:34,400 --> 04:38:36,680
You don't have a lot of money, so I get...

4024
04:38:36,680 --> 04:38:38,100
Yeah, I only have 173.

4025
04:38:40,380 --> 04:38:40,880
Hmm.

4026
04:38:42,520 --> 04:38:43,780
I'll go for Hermes.

4027
04:38:44,540 --> 04:38:46,460
I really need, like...

4028
04:38:46,460 --> 04:38:47,960
Yeah, it is the last one.

4029
04:38:48,740 --> 04:38:49,240
Okay.

4030
04:38:49,760 --> 04:38:51,260
I think he's gone for good.

4031
04:38:51,540 --> 04:38:52,840
He can't believe it still.

4032
04:38:53,160 --> 04:38:55,840
But there has been no sign of that monstrosity up here since
you last took him on.

4033
04:38:56,060 --> 04:38:57,000
But why am I surprised?

4034
04:38:57,380 --> 04:38:59,860
I figured if anyone could pull something like that off, it
would be you.

4035
04:39:05,300 --> 04:39:05,560
Oh.

4036
04:39:06,580 --> 04:39:07,440
That's good.

4037
04:39:09,900 --> 04:39:11,260
Alright, Hekatee time.

4038
04:39:11,580 --> 04:39:12,900
You know, Hekatee should just let me through.

4039
04:39:13,140 --> 04:39:13,420
I just...

4040
04:39:14,600 --> 04:39:14,960
What?

4041
04:39:16,460 --> 04:39:20,960
It seems the pathways into Erebus are not as well protected
as they used to be.

4042
04:39:22,560 --> 04:39:30,700
the individual who pitted you against me is this not no
how's he gonna know about that headmistress headmistress

4043
04:39:30,700 --> 04:39:45,300
fight him fight fight back can just walk past oh oh oh no oh
no his headmistress of yours has considerable knowledge to

4044
04:39:45,300 --> 04:39:54,300
have thus concealed you but she is weary it's up to that
time caught up with her That was a joke, Hekatee.

4045
04:39:54,600 --> 04:39:56,980
No, I'll fight you again, Hekatee.

4046
04:39:57,120 --> 04:39:57,740
It's okay.

4047
04:39:57,920 --> 04:40:02,060
I was just joking.

4048
04:40:03,700 --> 04:40:06,680
I have children taught me to pieces once before.

4049
04:40:07,420 --> 04:40:08,420
Look where I got them.

4050
04:40:09,040 --> 04:40:11,920
Whoever this is, perhaps she shall be more cooperative than
you.

4051
04:40:12,360 --> 04:40:15,400
Although I'm not particularly optimistic, nor should you be.

4052
04:40:16,060 --> 04:40:16,480
Good evening.

4053
04:40:18,220 --> 04:40:19,080
Come back.

4054
04:40:19,580 --> 04:40:21,060
Oh, wait.

4055
04:40:21,260 --> 04:40:21,840
Hey, free room.

4056
04:40:21,980 --> 04:40:22,280
Never mind.

4057
04:40:22,360 --> 04:40:22,540
That's fine.

4058
04:40:22,560 --> 04:40:23,020
Yeah.

4059
04:40:25,760 --> 04:40:26,640
Wait, actually.

4060
04:40:26,820 --> 04:40:27,320
No, that's fine.

4061
04:40:27,520 --> 04:40:28,020
Take her away.

4062
04:40:28,520 --> 04:40:28,800
Yay.

4063
04:40:29,280 --> 04:40:30,020
Free room.

4064
04:40:30,720 --> 04:40:32,640
I thought she was going to fight fucking.

4065
04:40:33,120 --> 04:40:34,180
I thought I had to fight him.

4066
04:40:34,360 --> 04:40:35,520
I mean, this is actually very.

4067
04:40:36,980 --> 04:40:37,320
Wow.

4068
04:40:37,620 --> 04:40:37,880
Yeah.

4069
04:40:38,760 --> 04:40:42,960
I was like going to say, like, I should be able to pass this
room for free.

4070
04:40:43,220 --> 04:40:43,660
Hold on.

4071
04:40:43,880 --> 04:40:44,840
I did.

4072
04:40:45,040 --> 04:40:45,440
Yippee.

4073
04:40:47,200 --> 04:40:47,600
Yippee.

4074
04:40:54,180 --> 04:40:54,980
Thanks, Grownos.

4075
04:40:55,080 --> 04:40:58,280
I guess I'll get the concave stone.

4076
04:41:11,820 --> 04:41:12,200
Yeah.

4077
04:41:14,880 --> 04:41:15,580
Win-win!

4078
04:41:22,300 --> 04:41:24,520
I like my frog did a little bounce there.

4079
04:41:26,420 --> 04:41:26,860
Alright.

4080
04:41:27,440 --> 04:41:28,580
The hater is back.

4081
04:41:33,370 --> 04:41:34,910
I still need regen.

4082
04:41:35,490 --> 04:41:37,290
Holy fuck this is so bad.

4083
04:41:37,750 --> 04:41:39,710
We have yet to find regen right now.

4084
04:41:42,930 --> 04:41:43,570
What?

4085
04:41:43,590 --> 04:41:44,870
Oh, no, I broke the thing.

4086
04:41:45,670 --> 04:41:46,330
That's not good.

4087
04:41:46,970 --> 04:41:47,870
That's actually not good.

4088
04:41:48,050 --> 04:41:49,950
I got...

4089
04:41:52,030 --> 04:41:52,830
I lacked...

4090
04:41:52,830 --> 04:41:54,510
I lacked information.

4091
04:41:55,870 --> 04:41:56,730
I lacked crucial information.

4092
04:41:57,350 --> 04:41:57,710
Okay, it's fine.

4093
04:41:57,770 --> 04:41:58,430
I actually needed money.

4094
04:41:58,590 --> 04:41:59,290
I like crucial information.

4095
04:41:59,530 --> 04:42:00,270
Oh, hey, duo!

4096
04:42:03,950 --> 04:42:05,450
Okay, which one was harder again?

4097
04:42:05,830 --> 04:42:07,550
Oh, which one was easier, guys?

4098
04:42:08,150 --> 04:42:08,710
Who do I pick?

4099
04:42:08,730 --> 04:42:09,810
Actually, no, let me face this.

4100
04:42:10,110 --> 04:42:11,290
Who do I pick first?

4101
04:42:14,330 --> 04:42:16,650
Who do I pick first?

4102
04:42:18,830 --> 04:42:20,290
Anyway, we have Chaos, too.

4103
04:42:21,890 --> 04:42:22,290
Pick Zeus?

4104
04:42:23,030 --> 04:42:25,070
I know that what Poseidon does.

4105
04:42:26,150 --> 04:42:26,330
Okay.

4106
04:42:32,630 --> 04:42:33,350
Uh...

4107
04:42:33,350 --> 04:42:34,590
One or three, chat.

4108
04:42:36,030 --> 04:42:37,570
Because they both seem good.

4109
04:42:45,520 --> 04:42:46,240
One?

4110
04:42:49,820 --> 04:42:51,100
Oh, it's split.

4111
04:43:02,100 --> 04:43:03,420
Okay, I'll do three.

4112
04:43:03,880 --> 04:43:05,820
God, okay, I mean, sure.

4113
04:43:14,960 --> 04:43:19,980
He's like, I mean, to be fair, it is so, but like, you know,
I still gotta do something, you know.

4114
04:43:21,360 --> 04:43:22,420
You're like, you know what I mean?

4115
04:43:22,740 --> 04:43:24,100
It is true, so, like, fair.

4116
04:43:24,440 --> 04:43:24,980
That's fair.

4117
04:43:27,480 --> 04:43:28,520
That's funny.

4118
04:43:29,580 --> 04:43:31,280
It is like broken, you know?

4119
04:43:31,800 --> 04:43:33,780
I get it, but still.

4120
04:43:37,860 --> 04:43:39,740
What is this?

4121
04:43:40,120 --> 04:43:41,760
Oh, this is the restore?

4122
04:43:42,640 --> 04:43:45,040
I had to like look at that.

4123
04:43:46,890 --> 04:43:49,110
I don't like that mana restore.

4124
04:44:02,460 --> 04:44:04,220
your texts

4125
04:44:08,760 --> 04:44:12,400
one one

4126
04:44:16,170 --> 04:44:19,470
or two or

4127
04:44:23,330 --> 04:44:39,450

but there's narcissists oh come on bro my oh she's in there

4128
04:44:39,450 --> 04:44:45,690
oh oh Oh my god.

4129
04:44:45,950 --> 04:44:49,070
It was the hardest choice of my life.

4130
04:44:52,630 --> 04:44:53,750
If this is your father.

4131
04:44:54,210 --> 04:44:56,270
No, I should have seen my own sheet.

4132
04:44:57,190 --> 04:44:59,570
I'll never see him again.

4133
04:44:59,750 --> 04:45:03,130
Which do you think is fun?

4134
04:45:04,730 --> 04:45:06,650
The father of all monsters is destroyed.

4135
04:45:06,790 --> 04:45:08,430
I should have went and saw the other sheet.

4136
04:45:08,950 --> 04:45:10,190
I should have saw him.

4137
04:45:12,290 --> 04:45:16,870
Oh my god, I can't believe I picked this bitch over Maoshi.

4138
04:45:20,270 --> 04:45:22,850
But if you fail, you should see him again.

4139
04:45:25,210 --> 04:45:28,790
I would learn from Doki to see my other team.

4140
04:45:30,330 --> 04:45:31,750
I'm so sad though.

4141
04:45:32,390 --> 04:45:33,810
I'm so sad.

4142
04:46:04,020 --> 04:46:05,840
I'll do one.

4143
04:46:06,080 --> 04:46:06,360
Yeah.

4144
04:46:07,880 --> 04:46:09,540
Oh my god, it's a boss fight.

4145
04:46:11,240 --> 04:46:12,480
Oh my god, okay.

4146
04:46:13,140 --> 04:46:14,100
I should have seen my Ushi.

4147
04:46:14,460 --> 04:46:14,760
I should...

4148
04:46:15,760 --> 04:46:18,360
I should have went for him.

4149
04:46:20,360 --> 04:46:21,880
It truly was.

4150
04:46:23,400 --> 04:46:24,640
I should have went for him.

4151
04:46:28,240 --> 04:46:29,560
Oh my god, wait, he's dead.

4152
04:46:29,660 --> 04:46:30,300
Okay, that's fine.

4153
04:46:32,020 --> 04:46:33,960
Wait, that was fast as fuck.

4154
04:46:34,120 --> 04:46:34,860
What the fuck?

4155
04:46:37,620 --> 04:46:44,440
My damage was insane even had a heart as there was not a
trace of love in him at all only the worst intentions and

4156

You're right.

4162
04:47:44,560 --> 04:47:46,260
She's twice as resourceful as Spidey.

4163
04:47:46,360 --> 04:47:47,120
She's a spider.

4164
04:47:47,580 --> 04:47:48,240
She'll be okay.

4165
04:47:50,540 --> 04:47:53,020
I believe it, hey?

4166
04:47:57,810 --> 04:47:59,150
Oh, plus 20?

4167
04:48:00,370 --> 04:48:01,050
Oh!

4168
04:48:02,750 --> 04:48:04,310
Volcanic strike, guys.

4169
04:48:08,220 --> 04:48:08,760
Or two.

4170
04:48:08,920 --> 04:48:09,660
Fuck, they're all good.

4171
04:48:11,640 --> 04:48:12,260
Or three.

4172
04:48:12,800 --> 04:48:13,040
Army.

4173
04:48:13,200 --> 04:48:16,040
Army or or 400?

4174
04:48:20,950 --> 04:48:21,630
Three?

4175
04:48:27,060 --> 04:48:27,560
Oh, okay.

4176
04:48:27,860 --> 04:48:28,600
I'll do it.

4177
04:48:29,300 --> 04:48:31,680
Also grab this since it's here.

4178
04:48:33,800 --> 04:48:35,740
I mean, 25 is pretty.

4179
04:48:38,420 --> 04:48:39,540
One or three, chat.

4180
04:48:42,140 --> 04:48:43,260
One or three.

4181
04:48:53,750 --> 04:48:57,270
Oh my god, it's perfectly divided.

4182
04:48:57,950 --> 04:48:58,830
It's half, half.

4183
04:49:01,130 --> 04:49:02,650
Oh my god, you guys...

4184
04:49:06,970 --> 04:49:07,190
One.

4185
04:49:07,790 --> 04:49:08,430
It'll be crazy.

4186
04:49:08,590 --> 04:49:09,590
I'm actually pressed two there.

4187
04:49:10,270 --> 04:49:12,950
It was that close to actually pressing two.

4188
04:49:15,570 --> 04:49:17,330
It was actually perfectly half.

4189
04:49:19,550 --> 04:49:20,410
Oh my god.

4190
04:49:20,530 --> 04:49:24,230
I'm a little scared because they do 35% more damage.

4191
04:49:24,450 --> 04:49:26,550
And I'm worried about that.

4192
04:49:27,650 --> 04:49:29,850
I do not think I can survive that.

4193
04:49:41,020 --> 04:49:41,500
Okay.

4194
04:49:42,580 --> 04:49:46,540
I feel like I have like a lack of damage right now.

4195
04:49:47,640 --> 04:49:48,800
Oh my god, there you are.

4196
04:49:49,780 --> 04:49:51,720
I was like wondering where you guys are.

4197
04:49:54,920 --> 04:49:56,080
Where are the others?

4198
04:49:58,020 --> 04:49:58,380
Hello?

4199
04:49:59,900 --> 04:50:01,120
Oh, there you are.

4200
04:50:01,180 --> 04:50:02,540
I was like, where's the last guy?

4201
04:50:10,360 --> 04:50:10,840
Ha!

4202
04:50:20,160 --> 04:50:20,740
Gamba.

4203
04:50:22,300 --> 04:50:24,040
That's Gamba time.

4204
04:50:35,150 --> 04:50:37,030
I'm so poor.

4205
04:50:39,310 --> 04:50:39,810
And this is...

4206
04:50:39,810 --> 04:50:41,030
Should this be my last encounter?

4207
04:50:41,690 --> 04:50:42,470
Oh, shit.

4208
04:50:43,890 --> 04:50:46,650
Just gonna go destroy this real quick.

4209
04:50:47,650 --> 04:50:48,690
Jesus Christ.

4210
04:50:53,680 --> 04:50:54,120
We're fine.

4211
04:50:55,100 --> 04:50:57,560
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa.

4212
04:50:57,720 --> 04:50:58,600
out of here.

4213
04:50:59,980 --> 04:51:00,500
No, I have two more.

4214
04:51:00,600 --> 04:51:02,040
Fucking hell, I have two more?

4215
04:51:07,740 --> 04:51:08,180
Alright.

4216
04:51:10,840 --> 04:51:11,280
Oh.

4217
04:51:12,160 --> 04:51:13,300
I don't think I have a lot.

4218
04:51:13,360 --> 04:51:14,320
No, I don't have money.

4219
04:51:15,680 --> 04:51:16,120
Health?

4220
04:51:16,800 --> 04:51:17,540
Or Hermes?

4221
04:51:25,220 --> 04:51:26,100
No money?

4222
04:51:26,620 --> 04:51:26,880
Hermes?

4223
04:51:27,000 --> 04:51:27,700
Alright, Hermes.

4224
04:51:27,900 --> 04:51:29,360
God, I've been like, so broke.

4225
04:51:30,080 --> 04:51:30,480
Oh, God.

4226
04:51:35,810 --> 04:51:36,390
Oh, my God.

4227
04:51:36,450 --> 04:51:37,350
I'm gonna be broke forever.

4228
04:51:37,990 --> 04:51:38,550
Come on.

4229
04:51:42,530 --> 04:51:45,430
Look at it.

4230
04:51:46,530 --> 04:51:49,970
Oh my god, I'm being so fucking poor.

4231
04:51:58,090 --> 04:52:02,390
Is it worth being broke forever?

4232
04:52:03,630 --> 04:52:04,790
Like...

4233
04:52:04,790 --> 04:52:07,550
Did she broke forever?

4234
04:52:10,450 --> 04:52:15,430
Oh my god, two legendaries and one fucking...

4235
04:52:15,430 --> 04:52:16,990
In one day?

4236
04:52:20,430 --> 04:52:23,590
I'll never have money again.

4237
04:52:27,170 --> 04:52:29,790
Oh my god, this is so hard.

4238
04:52:32,530 --> 04:52:34,390
Yeah, I've only can do one and...

4239
04:52:34,390 --> 04:52:37,230
Wait, if I get three, maybe I'll get one later.

4240
04:52:43,350 --> 04:52:45,710
No, I actually want to win this run, guys.

4241
04:52:45,910 --> 04:52:46,490
I'm worried.

4242
04:52:47,070 --> 04:52:50,330
Guys, I do want to win this run, guys.

4243
04:52:52,250 --> 04:52:53,170
I'm sorry.

4244
04:52:54,010 --> 04:52:56,230
It is very tempting.

4245
04:52:56,950 --> 04:52:57,330
It is.

4246
04:52:58,870 --> 04:52:59,830
Oh my god.

4247
04:53:00,150 --> 04:53:00,410
It is.

4248
04:53:01,010 --> 04:53:01,690
Oh my god.

4249
04:53:02,210 --> 04:53:03,430
Oh my god.

4250
04:53:03,650 --> 04:53:03,710
I know.

4251
04:53:04,030 --> 04:53:04,450
Oh my god.

4252
04:53:04,750 --> 04:53:05,230
Look at that.

4253
04:53:05,350 --> 04:53:06,470
He gave me, look at that.

4254
04:53:06,590 --> 04:53:07,130
A gambit.

4255
04:53:07,350 --> 04:53:08,750
It was worth the gambit.

4256
04:53:09,210 --> 04:53:15,010
I got the, I got the, I got the, three could save your life.

4257
04:53:15,630 --> 04:53:17,350
Kaboom, coward.

4258
04:53:20,450 --> 04:53:24,470
If, if I was a coward, why did Poseidon reward me?

4259
04:53:25,910 --> 04:53:27,390
Temptation resistant.

4260
04:53:27,930 --> 04:53:31,970
Guys, no, no, no, you could have had 300 HP.

4261
04:53:33,150 --> 04:53:35,970
Guys, I'd be broke forever, guys.

4262
04:53:39,370 --> 04:53:41,210
I had to fight them!

4263
04:53:41,750 --> 04:53:42,830
Don't worry, girls.

4264
04:53:43,210 --> 04:53:47,950
One day, they'll put us up on the biggest stage for all the
world to see.

4265
04:53:48,470 --> 04:53:49,850
Hello, your auntie is back.

4266
04:53:49,990 --> 04:53:52,570
You thought you saw the last of me when I didn't show up for
two days?

4267
04:53:53,170 --> 04:53:54,370
Oh, wait, even more than two days.

4268
04:53:55,010 --> 04:53:56,110
For like several weeks.

4269
04:53:57,430 --> 04:53:59,790
Oh, it may be a little song, do you know, lady?

4270
04:54:00,030 --> 04:54:02,030
But it's going to be huge someday.

4271
04:54:02,510 --> 04:54:03,130
You'll see.

4272
04:54:04,130 --> 04:54:05,890
We'll show her, won't we, girls?

4273
04:54:09,870 --> 04:54:10,750
I am.

4274
04:54:10,770 --> 04:54:14,010
I'm a little worried about myself.

4275
04:54:15,330 --> 04:54:20,170
I am just a little worried, guys.

4276
04:54:29,080 --> 04:54:30,800
Oh my god.

4277
04:54:31,920 --> 04:54:34,240
A lot of damage.

4278
04:54:35,720 --> 04:54:36,720
Oh,

4279
04:54:40,180 --> 04:54:41,300
I can't actually remember that.

4280
04:54:46,620 --> 04:54:47,800
Who is it?

4281
04:54:47,820 --> 04:54:48,300
Oh, it's her.

4282
04:54:50,680 --> 04:54:51,120
Ginny!

4283
04:54:54,180 --> 04:54:55,540
Go, Ginny, go!

4284
04:55:00,180 --> 04:55:01,580
Oh my god, okay, it's fine.

4285
04:55:07,350 --> 04:55:07,930
All right, nice.

4286
04:55:10,490 --> 04:55:11,370
There you go.

4287
04:55:12,630 --> 04:55:14,070
Oh my god, there's a double?

4288
04:55:19,070 --> 04:55:20,630
All right, last one.

4289
04:55:24,280 --> 04:55:25,080
Okay, nice.

4290
04:55:26,740 --> 04:55:28,680
Oh my god.

4291
04:55:28,940 --> 04:55:30,400
Oh, it's okay, it's just the armor.

4292
04:55:31,120 --> 04:55:32,500
Alright, last one.

4293
04:55:36,660 --> 04:55:37,340
It's fine.

4294
04:55:39,180 --> 04:55:40,300
It's fine, right?

4295
04:55:40,940 --> 04:55:41,900
Yeah, it's fine!

4296
04:55:45,440 --> 04:55:46,160
Just don't get hit.

4297
04:55:46,880 --> 04:55:47,660
It's fine.

4298
04:55:49,860 --> 04:55:51,140
Oh, see, they're cheering.

4299
04:55:51,420 --> 04:55:52,900
They didn't even want to hear you sing, girl.

4300
04:55:53,300 --> 04:55:54,260
They cheered for me.

4301
04:55:54,800 --> 04:55:57,100
They're like, oh my god, finally someone showed her up.

4302
04:56:00,500 --> 04:56:00,940
Oh.

4303
04:56:03,180 --> 04:56:05,820
Okay, uh, knuckle bones.

4304
04:56:10,750 --> 04:56:11,310
Alright.

4305
04:56:13,490 --> 04:56:14,350
Straight down.

4306
04:56:14,530 --> 04:56:15,750
Yanti won again.

4307
04:56:15,830 --> 04:56:17,290
They cheered for it, too.

4308
04:56:17,690 --> 04:56:19,690
So in the end, I didn't do a bad thing.

4309
04:56:21,630 --> 04:56:23,290
Yeah, they're like, fucking finally.

4310
04:56:27,510 --> 04:56:29,950
Someone finally got them off the stage.

4311
04:56:31,110 --> 04:56:32,450
Where the fuck- Oh, it's over here.

4312
04:56:33,790 --> 04:56:36,410
I feel like the entrance changes every time.

4313
04:56:36,970 --> 04:56:37,470
Does it?

4314
04:56:40,190 --> 04:56:45,070
Or I'ma just schizo about it.

4315
04:56:46,830 --> 04:56:47,290
Yeah.

4316
04:56:48,730 --> 04:56:50,530
I don't know if my damage is okay.

4317
04:56:56,380 --> 04:56:58,220
Oh my god, there's the goddamn shades.

4318
04:57:00,720 --> 04:57:02,100
Oh, I did not see these guys.

4319
04:57:02,300 --> 04:57:02,940
Oh, these guys.

4320
04:57:06,160 --> 04:57:06,840
Oh, nice.

4321
04:57:06,900 --> 04:57:08,000
My chaos disappeared.

4322
04:57:09,400 --> 04:57:10,600
What even was it?

4323
04:57:17,250 --> 04:57:18,330
What was my chaos?

4324
04:57:23,160 --> 04:57:24,020
Oh, HP.

4325
04:57:24,320 --> 04:57:25,420
Oh, nice.

4326
04:57:30,500 --> 04:57:31,480
Oh, there's shields here.

4327
04:57:31,600 --> 04:57:32,920
I'm gonna grab the shields just in case.

4328
04:57:37,060 --> 04:57:37,720
All right, nice.

4329
04:57:40,840 --> 04:57:42,080
Oh, it was cast damage?

4330
04:57:42,380 --> 04:57:43,220
Oh, okay.

4331
04:57:47,160 --> 04:57:48,300
That's always good.

4332
04:57:51,500 --> 04:57:52,260
Okay, nice.

4333
04:57:56,150 --> 04:57:57,390

This gives me three, though.

04:58:55,070 --> 04:58:56,390
I've had a great stream.

4346
04:58:58,850 --> 04:58:59,170
Oh.

4347
04:59:03,970 --> 04:59:05,270
I'm going to go for three.

4348
04:59:05,390 --> 04:59:06,650
Three is better than one.

4349
04:59:09,690 --> 04:59:10,970
I'm risking it.

4350
04:59:15,700 --> 04:59:16,880
Three is better than one.

4351
04:59:19,540 --> 04:59:22,120
Oh my god, there's a lot of shit actually here.

4352
04:59:27,310 --> 04:59:30,450
I am a little worried about my damage though.

4353
04:59:30,630 --> 04:59:34,610
It's not that much and that concerns me.

4354
04:59:36,290 --> 04:59:39,230
That makes me just a little nervous.

4355
04:59:43,170 --> 04:59:44,350
I can't see shit.

4356
04:59:44,970 --> 04:59:46,430
So I hope I'm hitting something.

4357
04:59:48,010 --> 04:59:49,110
Oh my god, it's these guys.

4358
04:59:58,530 --> 04:59:59,870
Oh my god, not this guy.

4359
05:00:04,280 --> 05:00:05,520
Okay, we'll grab the bones.

4360
05:00:07,160 --> 05:00:09,040
Is my damage really bad?

4361
05:00:14,420 --> 05:00:16,720
It feels bad, but I can't tell.

4362
05:00:21,600 --> 05:00:23,460
Okay, I'll grab the HP and then I'll grab.

4363
05:00:24,480 --> 05:00:26,060
I just need attack palm.

4364
05:00:29,280 --> 05:00:29,700
Boom.

4365
05:00:30,220 --> 05:00:30,220
Okay.

4366
05:00:30,500 --> 05:00:31,280
I mean, that makes sense.

4367
05:00:33,960 --> 05:00:34,940
Stop punching.

4368
05:00:36,280 --> 05:00:37,960
I demand you to stop.

4369
05:00:39,060 --> 05:00:39,280
Hello.

4370
05:00:39,660 --> 05:00:40,360
Sir, stop.

4371
05:00:45,040 --> 05:00:45,440
Alright.

4372
05:00:48,120 --> 05:00:49,120
Oh, yeah!

4373
05:00:49,860 --> 05:00:50,580
Oh my god.

4374
05:00:50,700 --> 05:00:52,740
Wait, the scamba is paying off so hard.

4375
05:00:53,920 --> 05:00:58,920
Bro, it was a 25%, but the 25% is hitting like 100% times.

4376
05:00:59,460 --> 05:01:00,520
It's actually crazy.

4377
05:01:14,180 --> 05:01:15,020
Let's see.

4378
05:01:16,900 --> 05:01:18,120
One, two, or three.

4379
05:01:21,020 --> 05:01:21,880
Okay, quick maps.

4380
05:01:34,680 --> 05:01:35,200
One?

4381
05:01:35,480 --> 05:01:36,600
All right, one time.

4382
05:01:38,000 --> 05:01:38,740
There we can go.

4383
05:01:38,800 --> 05:01:39,060
Moon?

4384
05:01:39,300 --> 05:01:39,900
Moon power?

4385
05:01:40,300 --> 05:01:40,820
Moon power?

4386
05:01:41,300 --> 05:01:41,600
Moon?

4387
05:01:42,580 --> 05:01:43,700
Oh, my God.

4388
05:01:43,880 --> 05:01:44,740
Okay, it's fine.

4389
05:01:45,160 --> 05:01:46,420
Maybe I can buy the moon.

4390
05:01:50,160 --> 05:01:50,620
Oh.

4391
05:01:51,320 --> 05:01:51,840
Oh.

4392
05:01:54,780 --> 05:01:56,520
Maybe I can buy the moon.

4393
05:01:59,980 --> 05:02:01,680
Wait, there's another thing I can...

4394
05:02:01,680 --> 05:02:02,480
Oh, there it is.

4395
05:02:04,700 --> 05:02:06,460
Okay, I can't buy the moon.

4396
05:02:10,770 --> 05:02:12,730
Okay, I mean, okay, that works.

4397
05:02:15,210 --> 05:02:16,190
That works.

4398
05:02:23,320 --> 05:02:23,560
Oh.

4399
05:02:30,320 --> 05:02:30,840
One?

4400
05:02:34,560 --> 05:02:34,980
Alright.

4401
05:02:39,750 --> 05:02:41,390
I don't need that, actually.

4402
05:02:51,370 --> 05:02:52,310
I guess we have to go here.

4403
05:02:53,110 --> 05:02:54,110
We need more palms.

4404
05:02:55,110 --> 05:02:56,130
Or we need more booms.

4405
05:03:06,920 --> 05:03:11,100
I am not a fan of my build right now, chat.

4406
05:03:11,840 --> 05:03:14,200
I feel very, very weak.

4407
05:03:16,700 --> 05:03:18,960
I do not feel confidence.

4408
05:03:27,200 --> 05:03:27,920
Where is he?

4409
05:03:28,020 --> 05:03:28,520
There he is.

4410
05:03:28,980 --> 05:03:30,940
I was gonna say, where the fuck is he?

4411
05:03:32,100 --> 05:03:33,740
Oh no, oh no, I'm sad.

4412
05:03:38,500 --> 05:03:39,360
Okay, that's bad.

4413
05:03:40,520 --> 05:03:42,060
God damn the fucking Medusas.

4414
05:03:43,960 --> 05:03:45,380
Medusas are the most annoying!

4415
05:03:48,360 --> 05:03:50,300
Oh my god, take this.

4416
05:03:53,220 --> 05:03:54,500
God, it takes forever!

4417
05:04:02,360 --> 05:04:04,480
Oh, yeah.

4418
05:04:06,000 --> 05:04:08,520
I don't feel very confident with this one.

4419
05:04:11,910 --> 05:04:13,230
I'll grab more army.

4420
05:04:13,910 --> 05:04:14,510
It's something.

4421
05:04:23,070 --> 05:04:23,550
Oh, hey!

4422
05:04:24,270 --> 05:04:25,710
At least I get my gamma.

4423
05:04:26,270 --> 05:04:27,730
I mean, I'm fine.

4424
05:04:27,930 --> 05:04:28,650
I'll take the gamma.

4425
05:04:31,170 --> 05:04:32,070
I'll go grab.

4426
05:04:32,590 --> 05:04:34,030
Get on the stairs real quick.

4427
05:04:42,980 --> 05:04:43,180
Alright.

4428
05:04:45,140 --> 05:04:46,060
Hey, more gamma.

4429
05:04:47,420 --> 05:04:48,240
Oh, God.

4430
05:04:48,480 --> 05:04:48,720
Not her.

4431
05:04:49,220 --> 05:04:49,880
Oh, no.

4432
05:04:50,920 --> 05:04:52,100
I'm so bad with these.

4433
05:04:52,200 --> 05:04:53,180
Oh, my God.

4434
05:04:54,160 --> 05:04:59,760
He just keeps doing it and I let her just let it happen

4435
05:05:04,900 --> 05:05:15,060
I don't know what it is about it I have three oh wait no I
don't use uh

4436
05:05:20,210 --> 05:05:29,190
Two or three Two All right, we'll go to

4437
05:05:34,990 --> 05:05:38,630
Okay, I'll grab the money real quick.

4438
05:05:40,090 --> 05:05:42,470
And then, and it was Zeus.

4439
05:05:43,290 --> 05:05:44,030
Still no moon.

4440
05:05:45,630 --> 05:05:47,110
Still no moon.

4441
05:05:47,930 --> 05:05:51,130
And it's making me very nervous right now.

4442
05:05:52,950 --> 05:05:55,770
Making me very nervous.

4443
05:06:01,280 --> 05:06:02,640
Oh my god, I can't believe I missed.

4444
05:06:09,790 --> 05:06:10,670
because i

4445
05:06:15,680 --> 05:06:19,580
was thinking about the moon that's how i missed it

4446
05:06:26,440 --> 05:06:27,960
hit double strike

4447
05:06:31,860 --> 05:06:46,200
the whole this one is always so good for me though i mean
okay shop that's just it is it just a shop

4448
05:06:56,730 --> 05:07:01,010
Yeah, I wanted to use it for Cerberus.

4449
05:07:01,250 --> 05:07:02,230
Oh my god, there's still...

4450
05:07:02,230 --> 05:07:03,070
Are you serious?

4451
05:07:03,490 --> 05:07:03,870
Where?

4452
05:07:04,630 --> 05:07:04,920
I...

4453
05:07:05,210 --> 05:07:06,990
Okay, that's fine.

4454
05:07:08,250 --> 05:07:09,270
That's fine.

4455
05:07:15,650 --> 05:07:17,390
Okay, I'm gonna do security system.

4456
05:07:18,730 --> 05:07:20,170
This is gonna clutch it.

4457
05:07:26,030 --> 05:07:26,670
I think...

4458
05:07:26,670 --> 05:07:28,570
Yeah, the moon has definitely been banished.

4459
05:07:33,240 --> 05:07:35,120
The moon no longer haunts me.

4460
05:07:35,800 --> 05:07:36,260
No.

4461
05:07:37,640 --> 05:07:40,840
The moon no longer haunts me, guys.

4462
05:07:43,560 --> 05:07:43,900
Oh.

4463
05:07:46,260 --> 05:07:51,920
I'm a little worried because I don't feel great about my
build.

4464
05:07:58,550 --> 05:08:00,230
That's the only issue.

4465
05:08:02,670 --> 05:08:03,910
Holy shit, never mind.

4466
05:08:04,650 --> 05:08:05,970
That's a lot of damage.

4467
05:08:06,650 --> 05:08:08,290
Never fucking mind.

4468
05:08:08,650 --> 05:08:10,830
Bro, if only I could turn all these guys in.

4469
05:08:10,850 --> 05:08:12,270
the sheep, though.

4470
05:08:15,230 --> 05:08:19,330
If only I could turn all these guys into sheep.

4471
05:08:27,440 --> 05:08:27,720
Oh my god.

4472
05:08:27,980 --> 05:08:28,320
Fucking Corey C.

4473
05:08:28,400 --> 05:08:29,580
That just moves away.

4474
05:08:35,750 --> 05:08:36,790
Grab this.

4475
05:08:41,100 --> 05:08:41,280
Oh.

4476
05:08:45,620 --> 05:08:46,740
Oh, that hits me.

4477
05:08:46,800 --> 05:08:47,440
Okay, that's fine.

4478
05:08:52,480 --> 05:08:52,960
It's okay.

4479
05:08:55,580 --> 05:08:56,700
Is that safe?

4480
05:08:57,000 --> 05:08:58,960
Oh, I am.

4481
05:08:59,520 --> 05:08:59,940
Oh!

4482
05:09:01,160 --> 05:09:01,700
It's a hit.

4483
05:09:01,920 --> 05:09:02,500
One last...

4484
05:09:02,500 --> 05:09:04,400
One last 30 damage on me.

4485
05:09:04,500 --> 05:09:05,190
That's a kit.

4486
05:09:06,700 --> 05:09:08,020
Unmired for the moment.

4487
05:09:08,720 --> 05:09:12,300
Fearsome Cerberus gives the princess an appreciative look.

4488
05:09:16,740 --> 05:09:18,040
Alright, he's happy again.

4489
05:09:18,800 --> 05:09:19,140
Bye.

4490
05:09:23,690 --> 05:09:24,510
Mining.

4491
05:09:24,790 --> 05:09:26,150
One last mining.

4492
05:09:29,330 --> 05:09:30,990
All right, down I go.

4493
05:09:33,010 --> 05:09:33,890
Down, I'll go.

4494
05:09:35,630 --> 05:09:40,210
He did hit me, but like 30 damage, though, which I did not
like that.

4495
05:09:42,470 --> 05:09:44,870
All right, Death Defiance.

4496
05:09:48,090 --> 05:09:50,070
Sure, the next boon is rare.

4497
05:09:54,300 --> 05:09:58,560
To the calculating Titan of Time rested control of the
underworld.

4498
05:09:59,480 --> 05:10:02,080
He sealed shut the major artery from Tartarus.

4499
05:10:02,140 --> 05:10:12,980
yet the princess of the dead knows of a hidden passageway
within oh yep here it is here's the hidden door knock knock

4500
05:10:12,980 --> 05:10:25,840
oh no this build is so strange I think this is the weirdest
build I've ever done you got this Melanie wait I'm not I'm

4501
05:10:25,840 --> 05:10:27,500
wearing shoes?

4502
05:10:28,580 --> 05:10:30,960
I just noticed that.

4503
05:10:33,580 --> 05:10:34,840
Oh my god, Mellowy.

4504
05:10:35,020 --> 05:10:36,500
That is not safe.

4505
05:10:41,720 --> 05:10:44,160
Mellowy, you were in the forest!

4506
05:10:48,190 --> 05:10:50,730
I just noticed that I'm shoeless.

4507
05:11:01,420 --> 05:11:02,020
Where is he?

4508
05:11:04,520 --> 05:11:07,080
Your feet are on fire.

4509
05:11:09,800 --> 05:11:10,700
All right, there's a duo.

4510
05:11:10,760 --> 05:11:11,840
At least there's a duo, Pum.

4511
05:11:15,460 --> 05:11:15,780
All right.

4512
05:11:17,500 --> 05:11:19,520
Is Aphrodite hard or not?

4513
05:11:22,600 --> 05:11:23,520
Family dispute.

4514
05:11:30,200 --> 05:11:32,860
You're keeping those posies out.

4515
05:11:41,620 --> 05:11:41,780
Oh!

4516
05:11:42,220 --> 05:11:43,260
I have eight.

4517
05:11:43,880 --> 05:11:44,340
Oh!

4518
05:11:44,660 --> 05:11:45,840
Wait, I have to get this.

4519
05:11:45,900 --> 05:11:46,240
Okay, I have to get this.

4520
05:11:46,260 --> 05:11:47,160
have to get two.

4521
05:11:49,860 --> 05:11:55,600
Because I feel like two would be really good during the last
fight.

4522
05:11:56,520 --> 05:11:58,340
Because I don't have to run into them.

4523
05:11:58,780 --> 05:12:00,000
Yeah, I don't have to run into them.

4524
05:12:03,260 --> 05:12:04,240
Oh, you my blessings.

4525
05:12:04,380 --> 05:12:05,780
You can just save them for later.

4526
05:12:05,980 --> 05:12:06,880
Like some sort of snap.

4527
05:12:07,120 --> 05:12:07,920
Oh, she's angry.

4528
05:12:08,760 --> 05:12:09,920
You can have it.

4529
05:12:12,920 --> 05:12:15,360
I don't know what she does.

4530
05:12:16,640 --> 05:12:17,500
And I...

4531
05:12:17,500 --> 05:12:19,140
Oh, Oh, it's a heart that follows me.

4532
05:12:19,500 --> 05:12:19,500
Okay.

4533
05:12:23,320 --> 05:12:24,220
Okay, it's okay.

4534
05:12:24,520 --> 05:12:26,260
It takes a while for it to follow me.

4535
05:12:28,440 --> 05:12:29,400
Oh my god, it's getting closer though.

4536
05:12:29,620 --> 05:12:30,060
It's...

4537
05:12:30,060 --> 05:12:34,360
It follows me for a very long time, but it's okay.

4538
05:12:34,580 --> 05:12:35,640
It still takes a while.

4539
05:12:35,780 --> 05:12:36,580
Okay, it's okay.

4540
05:12:39,380 --> 05:12:41,520
I don't know where it is though right now.

4541
05:12:41,560 --> 05:12:42,260
There he is, God.

4542
05:12:43,880 --> 05:12:46,060
It's like the snail that follows you.

4543
05:12:47,560 --> 05:12:48,440
It follows.

4544
05:12:48,980 --> 05:12:49,560
It's like the...

4545
05:12:49,580 --> 05:12:52,020
The horror film guy, it follows.

4546
05:12:58,730 --> 05:12:58,790
Huh?

4547
05:13:05,300 --> 05:13:06,060
One or three?

4548
05:13:11,970 --> 05:13:13,510
I am not getting two.

4549
05:13:14,930 --> 05:13:16,590
Because we're going to lose a lot of health.

4550
05:13:21,730 --> 05:13:22,290
Or one?

4551
05:13:24,090 --> 05:13:25,090
Three safe there?

4552
05:13:25,270 --> 05:13:25,990
Oh, I will do safe.

4553
05:13:26,110 --> 05:13:27,610
Oh my god, that's a lot of HP.

4554
05:13:33,370 --> 05:13:35,990
I know I say it's a lot, but I'm confident.

4555
05:13:36,110 --> 05:13:39,110
that I will lose that HP very fast.

4556
05:13:48,070 --> 05:13:48,630
All right, nice.

4557
05:13:50,470 --> 05:13:51,750
Triple palms.

4558
05:13:52,290 --> 05:13:52,990
Triple palms.

4559
05:13:53,410 --> 05:13:55,210
Oh my god, triple palms!

4560
05:13:57,130 --> 05:13:59,090
That's a lot of palms!

4561
05:13:59,730 --> 05:14:00,410
Oh god.

4562
05:14:02,150 --> 05:14:03,570
That actually was very scary.

4563
05:14:04,410 --> 05:14:05,590
I got very worried here.

4564
05:14:13,270 --> 05:14:15,030
What the fuck it hit me?

4565
05:14:17,070 --> 05:14:17,990
There you go.

4566
05:14:22,640 --> 05:14:24,600
One, two, or three, guys.

4567
05:14:27,060 --> 05:14:27,560
Pum-pums.

4568
05:14:28,560 --> 05:14:29,100
Pum-pum-pum.

4569
05:14:42,320 --> 05:14:43,140
All right.

4570
05:14:43,920 --> 05:14:44,280
One.

4571
05:14:49,180 --> 05:14:49,820
Two.

4572
05:14:55,240 --> 05:14:55,260
Oh.

4573
05:15:00,080 --> 05:15:01,040
Okay, one.

4574
05:15:01,340 --> 05:15:01,800
I see more.

4575
05:15:01,940 --> 05:15:02,560
Oh, yeah!

4576
05:15:07,930 --> 05:15:08,570
Oh.

4577
05:15:09,330 --> 05:15:10,710
We're not doing Gamma, guys.

4578
05:15:10,770 --> 05:15:12,210
We're not doing Gamma again.

4579
05:15:14,270 --> 05:15:16,950
He's already spoiling me with Gamma.

4580
05:15:19,850 --> 05:15:20,450
What?

4581
05:15:21,830 --> 05:15:22,410
Yay!

4582
05:15:25,070 --> 05:15:26,270
More Gamma!

4583
05:15:27,850 --> 05:15:29,050
Gamma Infinite.

4584
05:15:29,290 --> 05:15:30,290
I thought it was just great.

4585
05:15:30,550 --> 05:15:33,710
It says 25% but I've been getting unlimited Gamma.

4586
05:15:36,210 --> 05:15:39,250
It's actually crazy how much Gamma I've been getting.

4587

Yeah, there's no more.

4599
05:17:49,560 --> 05:17:50,880
Okay, I'll just kill him.

4600
05:17:51,020 --> 05:17:52,200
Like, fuck this guy.

4601
05:17:52,520 --> 05:17:53,180
Oh, shit!

4602
05:17:59,320 --> 05:18:00,100
It's okay.

4603
05:18:01,340 --> 05:18:02,160
It's fine.

4604
05:18:08,010 --> 05:18:08,530
Yeah!

4605
05:18:10,350 --> 05:18:11,430
Something here, right?

4606
05:18:12,450 --> 05:18:14,290
Oh, yeah, I can't be greedy no more.

4607
05:18:14,730 --> 05:18:15,830
I took everything.

4608
05:18:17,590 --> 05:18:20,950
I'm just surprised we haven't talked to Hades yet, you know?

4609
05:18:22,890 --> 05:18:25,950
You would think that Hades would show up right now.

4610
05:18:27,170 --> 05:18:27,830
Oh, my.

4611
05:18:27,990 --> 05:18:29,070
It's just all guns.

4612
05:18:31,910 --> 05:18:33,230
It's literally just all guns.

4613
05:18:34,430 --> 05:18:35,470
I can't see anything.

4614
05:18:37,130 --> 05:18:38,170
Jesus Christ.

4615
05:18:43,650 --> 05:18:44,130
There you go.

4616
05:18:46,970 --> 05:18:47,430
Oh, my God.

4617
05:18:47,730 --> 05:18:48,690
Hades never showed up.

4618
05:18:49,230 --> 05:18:50,750
I never saw my dad.

4619
05:18:51,830 --> 05:18:53,610
Where's where's poppy?

4620
05:18:57,710 --> 05:19:05,450

4621
05:19:08,150 --> 05:19:08,850

Thank you.

Oh, my God, they keep giving me...

4636
05:21:44,530 --> 05:21:46,190
I have so much Zeus shit right now.

4637
05:21:46,270 --> 05:21:47,970
I think majority of this is just Zeus.

4638
05:21:57,440 --> 05:21:58,320
Only Uncle.

4639
05:21:59,220 --> 05:22:00,420
I only see Uncle.

4640
05:22:01,600 --> 05:22:01,780
Two.

4641
05:22:01,960 --> 05:22:02,220
Okay.

4642
05:22:03,420 --> 05:22:04,760
And now grab extra shield.

4643
05:22:05,820 --> 05:22:07,780
And then, I mean, fucking...

4644
05:22:07,780 --> 05:22:09,080
I don't have any...

4645
05:22:09,080 --> 05:22:09,420
That way.

4646
05:22:09,540 --> 05:22:10,060
Oh, yay!

4647
05:22:10,260 --> 05:22:10,980
Credit card!

4648
05:22:12,260 --> 05:22:12,780
Here we go.

4649
05:22:13,740 --> 05:22:18,940
I can't believe we didn't fucking see the Hades at all.

4650
05:22:19,380 --> 05:22:20,860
Where is she?

4651
05:22:20,980 --> 05:22:21,280
Where is she?

4652
05:22:21,280 --> 05:22:21,880
Where is that Katia?

4653
05:22:22,440 --> 05:22:24,340
She is now my guest.

4654
05:22:26,220 --> 05:22:27,280
It should really be fine, right?

4655
05:22:27,300 --> 05:22:30,100
I call that old witch whom you seem to care about so much.

4656
05:22:30,420 --> 05:22:31,320
Your head is just...

4657
05:22:31,320 --> 05:22:32,020
Out of 1,900.

4658
05:22:32,420 --> 05:22:36,340
You can now exactly who she is if you yet value her
well-being in the least.

4659
05:22:38,180 --> 05:22:39,620
She was my mother's handmaiden.

4660
05:22:39,880 --> 05:22:40,220
Nothing more.

4661
05:22:40,220 --> 05:22:40,500
Yeah.

4662
05:22:40,680 --> 05:22:41,760
She's not special.

4663
05:22:42,260 --> 05:22:42,700
Here I go.

4664
05:22:43,000 --> 05:22:43,720
She took me away.

4665
05:22:44,420 --> 05:22:48,340
When I came of age, I vowed to stop you, despite her efforts
to dissuade me.

4666
05:22:49,020 --> 05:22:50,260
Let her go.

4667
05:22:52,560 --> 05:22:55,880
At first, I thought perhaps that you were a child of Zimps
rather than Hades.

4668
05:22:56,620 --> 05:22:58,540
But you are a terrible liar, granddaughter.

4669
05:22:59,120 --> 05:23:03,920
You shall suffer for your actions, or the handmaidens shall
do so in your stead.

4670
05:23:04,240 --> 05:23:05,260
That was actually crazy.

4671
05:23:05,300 --> 05:23:06,860
I didn't get a single moon power.

4672
05:23:08,140 --> 05:23:09,180
That's insane.

4673
05:23:11,240 --> 05:23:11,760
That's insane.

4674
05:23:12,260 --> 05:23:16,480
Oh my god, it was so sensitive that it like fucked me up.

4675
05:23:16,840 --> 05:23:18,000
I did not mean to do that

4676
05:23:23,760 --> 05:23:26,820
That was actually I did not mean to fuck that up

4677
05:23:31,120 --> 05:23:32,840
Are you serious?

4678
05:23:38,320 --> 05:23:47,980
That was an accident I did not see I did not see that move
at all So like, it like confused me

4679
05:23:55,160 --> 05:23:56,740
Alright, I'll get rid of this, though

4680
05:24:00,460 --> 05:24:09,020
There you go I'm gonna get rid of this just in case Okay

4681
05:24:13,980 --> 05:24:14,440
Really?

4682
05:24:15,740 --> 05:24:17,040
That hurts me?

4683
05:24:18,380 --> 05:24:20,120
Oh my god That also hurts me.

4684
05:24:26,410 --> 05:24:27,210
Fuck off.

4685
05:24:29,350 --> 05:24:30,330
There you go.

4686
05:24:34,610 --> 05:24:35,430
Are you fucking- Okay.

4687
05:24:35,830 --> 05:24:36,290
That's okay.

4688
05:24:42,630 --> 05:24:43,630
Okay, that's fine.

4689
05:24:44,630 --> 05:24:46,130
I can't see, but that's okay.

4690
05:24:46,810 --> 05:24:47,890
I don't need a C.

4691
05:24:52,740 --> 05:24:54,200
I don't need a C.

4692
05:24:56,700 --> 05:24:57,080
Yeah!

4693
05:24:58,720 --> 05:24:59,840
We're tanky.

4694
05:25:03,000 --> 05:25:04,220
Okay, where is it?

4695
05:25:08,650 --> 05:25:08,750
Okay.

4696
05:25:12,920 --> 05:25:13,860
Alright, it's a fight.

4697
05:25:22,060 --> 05:25:23,220
Oh my god, I can't see shit.

4698
05:25:23,640 --> 05:25:25,720
I can't see shit in this world.

4699
05:25:28,800 --> 05:25:29,800
Oh my god.

4700
05:25:40,590 --> 05:25:42,210
Oh my god, we can't let you heal.

4701
05:25:42,970 --> 05:25:43,370

Look what you've done.

4734
05:29:11,800 --> 05:29:13,780
You're trying to take everything from us.

4735
05:29:14,080 --> 05:29:14,740
Our future.

4745
05:30:46,820 --> 05:30:47,900

4746
05:31:05,120 --> 05:31:05,560
Hello.

4747
05:31:10,120 --> 05:31:10,740
Hello, brother.

4748
05:31:11,480 --> 05:31:11,920
Brother?

4749
05:31:12,800 --> 05:31:13,460
I'm here.

4750
05:31:14,000 --> 05:31:14,360
You've returned.

4751
05:31:15,080 --> 05:31:18,600
You've no idea how much difficulty I had falling asleep so I
could see you here again.

4752
05:31:19,020 --> 05:31:19,520
So what's the word?

4753
05:31:19,740 --> 05:31:20,480
Have you prepared the spear?

4754
05:31:21,760 --> 05:31:23,780
Take hold of Gagaros and we'll find out.

4755
05:31:24,460 --> 05:31:26,520
You'll have to go immediately to where Kronos resides.

4756
05:31:26,940 --> 05:31:30,300
Speak to him, but do not mention me at all as I've not yet
been born.

4757
05:31:31,020 --> 05:31:32,280
I'll be counting on you to succeed.

4758
05:31:33,300 --> 05:31:36,620
Yeah, I heard the old ending was really shit, so I wonder...

4759
05:31:38,600 --> 05:31:41,340
Is this the new ending where they fixed the shitty ending,
apparently?

4760
05:31:41,380 --> 05:31:43,340
Or else it's death to Kronos, like you said.

4761
05:31:44,200 --> 05:31:50,000
Do you truly think there's any possibility he comes around
that I won't have to kill him?

4762
05:31:51,400 --> 05:31:54,420
Knowing there are infinite possibilities, then I suppose so,
yes.

4763
05:31:55,280 --> 05:31:57,080
But I'm so angry with him still.

4764
05:31:57,640 --> 05:31:57,920
Oh.

4765
05:31:58,120 --> 05:31:59,520
I'm frightened about what may come to pass.

4766
05:32:00,420 --> 05:32:02,040
He's taken so much from me.

4767
05:32:02,620 --> 05:32:15,020
of us and yet he wants his family back too one way or
another he'll get what's coming we all will okay but we're

4768
05:32:15,020 --> 05:32:21,520
getting your family back not just his this is a lot to think
the spear of fathers has the power to destroy a deathless

4769
05:32:21,520 --> 05:32:34,660
Titan it shall in just a moment so hold it close may earth
and night in darkness hear me now bring true by my vow to

4770
05:32:34,660 --> 05:32:43,660
solution of time oh my god it's a it's incantation i used i
mean it's grown hot to the touch but feels much lighter than

4771
05:32:43,660 --> 05:32:50,920
before as well i suppose i should be careful not to prod
somebody with it besides chronos go zagrius i've done

4772
05:32:50,920 --> 05:32:58,100
everything i can here and we'll see each other again some
other time than this perhaps but still for now farewell

4773
05:33:02,620 --> 05:33:03,360
Goodbye, my enemy.

4774
05:33:04,120 --> 05:33:04,860
I hope this works.

4775
05:33:09,300 --> 05:33:09,980
Tartarus?

4776
05:33:10,860 --> 05:33:11,320
Huh?

4777
05:33:12,440 --> 05:33:12,600
What?

4778
05:33:13,480 --> 05:33:14,280
It's not over?

4779
05:33:17,410 --> 05:33:20,390
What is all that infernal racket?

4780
05:33:22,110 --> 05:33:24,370
Science fools has to be caught.

4781
05:33:25,830 --> 05:33:28,870
Oh, I'm coming over!

4782
05:33:33,030 --> 05:33:34,190
Hello, I'm here.

4783
05:33:36,410 --> 05:33:37,170
Hello, grandpappy.

4784
05:33:42,170 --> 05:33:42,550
Mad.

4785
05:33:44,370 --> 05:33:45,710
You must be grandfather.

4786
05:33:46,430 --> 05:33:47,410
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

4787
05:33:47,570 --> 05:33:48,290
I'm called Zagreus.

4788
05:33:49,090 --> 05:33:52,150
I got to tip about your quite suspicious cabin and decided
to go take a look.

4789
05:33:52,930 --> 05:33:54,770
What are you doing here if I may ask?

4790
05:33:55,890 --> 05:33:56,270
Incorporated.

4791
05:33:56,930 --> 05:33:59,530
What else would I possibly be doing in a place such as this?

4792
05:33:59,530 --> 05:34:03,370
So I suppose Hendy is just a thing for this new grandchild
of mine.

4793
05:34:03,970 --> 05:34:07,690
And I thought that I would see the age when he became a
father for himself.

4794
05:34:09,090 --> 05:34:11,410
Oh, he's a wonderful father, if you must know.

4795
05:34:12,090 --> 05:34:14,310
My sole disappointment is that I'm an only child.

4796
05:34:14,910 --> 05:34:18,250
But he and my dear mother, Persephone, the underworld queen,
truly love each other.

4797
05:34:18,510 --> 05:34:19,470
So down the line.

4798
05:34:20,170 --> 05:34:21,270
Yeah, it's just me.

4799
05:34:21,510 --> 05:34:22,310
No other child.

4800
05:34:22,450 --> 05:34:23,430
Nope, just me.

4801
05:34:24,350 --> 05:34:24,790
That's...

4802
05:34:24,790 --> 05:34:26,730
Bro, you're killing it, bro.

4803
05:34:26,870 --> 05:34:27,590
Not suspicious.

4804
05:34:28,410 --> 05:34:29,510
I am a tetanus.

4805
05:34:29,530 --> 05:34:36,950
Yeah, he's like, what does fuck do I care that you're an
only child, bro?

4806
05:34:37,630 --> 05:34:40,610
Right, even Kronos is like, um, okay.

4807
05:34:42,110 --> 05:34:42,990
No, this.

4808
05:34:44,010 --> 05:34:45,970
Grandfather, I'm telling you all this.

4809
05:34:46,070 --> 05:34:48,070
Yeah, you had one job.

4810
05:34:49,390 --> 05:34:51,550
If you would bring pain and suffering upon my house.

4811
05:34:51,990 --> 05:34:52,650
So smooth.

4812
05:34:53,630 --> 05:34:54,510
Thumbs up.

4813
05:34:59,320 --> 05:35:01,260
Do you know what my intent?

4814
05:35:01,960 --> 05:35:04,680
It is victim to your pain and suffering.

4815
05:35:04,820 --> 05:35:09,960
Here I have wrought it since an yarm prior to when you were
about the twinkle in your father's eyes.

4816
05:35:11,220 --> 05:35:16,520
There, twinkle in your father's eyes, like, since you were
in his balls.

4817
05:35:19,140 --> 05:35:21,160
That's a nice way to say it.

4818
05:35:21,480 --> 05:35:24,120
He'd grown isolated from Olympus and Persephone and me.

4819
05:35:24,840 --> 05:35:25,660
Didn't do him any good.

4820
05:35:26,360 --> 05:35:26,960
What about you?

4821
05:35:27,520 --> 05:35:28,280
We've only met.

4822
05:35:28,660 --> 05:35:30,320
Are you prepared to sweep me into your old grudge?

4823
05:35:32,160 --> 05:35:34,140
That's a nice way to say it, though.

4824
05:35:34,720 --> 05:35:39,920
Your father and his brothers surely have already poisoned
you with your entire generation against me.

4825
05:35:41,400 --> 05:35:42,980
What I'd be speaking to you if that were the case?

4826
05:35:43,760 --> 05:35:44,480
Here's the arrangement.

4827
05:35:45,200 --> 05:35:49,920
Either come along quietly to a little surprise family
reunion, or take this spear repeatedly.

4828
05:35:50,680 --> 05:35:52,200
And you won't soon recuperate, I swear.

4829
05:35:53,020 --> 05:35:54,620
Which is it going to be?

4830
05:35:56,020 --> 05:36:01,280
You, who threatened me with annihilation, have not
experienced a wealth without time.

4831
05:36:01,960 --> 05:36:09,740
would have to dearly miss my influence nor shall i be shamed
and rid of you before my team what do you have me do when

4832
05:36:09,740 --> 05:36:16,700
they look upon me oh i don't know perhaps just act like
you're my grandfather sneaking underneath the house in some

4833
05:36:16,700 --> 05:36:24,860
sort of profane chamber i ought to have known about your
time why don't you extrapolate a bit extrapolate what

4834
05:36:24,860 --> 05:36:27,020
actually feel the life

4835
05:36:32,440 --> 05:36:45,200
Oh He's like I'm not here to be a grandpa No, because you'll
be under my protection and also no it won't just be a

4836
05:36:45,200 --> 05:36:49,720
joy-filled life Especially if you keep on but it'll probably
be better than whatever this is.

4837
05:36:50,040 --> 05:36:53,060
It's like fuck that shit I don't have all day your night

4838
05:36:56,160 --> 05:37:01,140
Selen a future with such grandchildren as you or the eternal
void

4839
05:37:04,800 --> 05:37:05,600
That's it.

4840
05:37:05,700 --> 05:37:06,380
I'm stabbing you.

4841
05:37:08,820 --> 05:37:11,620
It's like a way too long.

4842
05:37:13,840 --> 05:37:15,000
It's like Jacob.

4843
05:37:15,700 --> 05:37:15,700
Whatever.

4844
05:37:15,960 --> 05:37:16,540
Fuck this.

4845
05:37:17,500 --> 05:37:18,980
I'm done talking.

4846
05:37:20,920 --> 05:37:24,440
Three, two, one.

4847
05:37:27,520 --> 05:37:27,780
What?

4848
05:37:28,160 --> 05:37:29,280
Ready or not.

4849
05:37:29,800 --> 05:37:30,480
Hence, I go.

4850
05:37:31,060 --> 05:37:31,820
Oh, wait.

4851
05:37:32,380 --> 05:37:32,660
Oh.

4852
05:37:33,740 --> 05:37:35,580
Oh, wait, what?

4853
05:37:36,320 --> 05:37:36,920
I'm a grandpa.

4854
05:37:39,080 --> 05:37:40,560
What the fuck?

4855
05:37:42,900 --> 05:37:45,220
I tried to blow a seat now.

4856
05:37:45,980 --> 05:37:46,920
Wait, what?

4857
05:37:46,920 --> 05:37:46,940
Wait, what?

4858
05:37:46,940 --> 05:37:48,500
I'm going to leave my daughter unattended.

4859
05:37:50,540 --> 05:37:52,920
Oh my god, I'm doing grandfather's things now.

4860
05:37:53,500 --> 05:37:55,660
I've grandpa simulated it.

4861
05:37:55,900 --> 05:37:56,860
Well, this is a rare treat.

4862
05:37:57,160 --> 05:37:58,660
The both of you together in this lounge.

4863
05:37:59,000 --> 05:38:00,000
What brings you here, grandfather?

4864
05:38:02,380 --> 05:38:03,400
I yet to see you.

4865
05:38:03,420 --> 05:38:06,100
I beat him up and now he's willing to be a grandpa.

4866
05:38:06,140 --> 05:38:09,460
I have turned over this residence in its entirety and found
nary a sign.

4867
05:38:10,020 --> 05:38:12,660
She is already as elusive as you always were, Hades.

4868
05:38:14,100 --> 05:38:20,100
Now though your old senses have dulled, she went running
over there by the head chef, where she yet lingers in

4869
05:38:20,100 --> 05:38:20,700
silence.

4870
05:38:21,220 --> 05:38:22,840
Go before her patience wears things.

4871
05:38:22,840 --> 05:38:25,920
Wasn't the issue was that I'll eat people?

4872
05:38:27,260 --> 05:38:28,640
What if I get hungry?

4873
05:38:28,860 --> 05:38:31,760
Was no, we've no idea where my good son's little sister is.

4874
05:38:32,120 --> 05:38:32,880
She could be anywhere.

4875
05:38:33,440 --> 05:38:36,880
Oh, Zagorus is his favorite grandchild.

4876
05:38:38,500 --> 05:38:39,680
Yeah, he wanted to talk to him.

4877
05:38:41,820 --> 05:38:42,960
And he over here.

4878
05:38:43,100 --> 05:38:43,860
Oh, there you...

4879
05:38:43,860 --> 05:38:45,020
Oh, she's over there.

4880
05:38:45,980 --> 05:38:49,560
Well, alright, let's pretend we didn't see her, because I
wasn't...

4881
05:38:50,260 --> 05:38:51,620
Yeah, oh, I can go here.

4882
05:38:51,700 --> 05:38:54,380
Yeah, it wasn't the whole issue was that...

4883
05:38:54,800 --> 05:38:57,440
He likes to eat people, especially kids.

4884
05:38:58,720 --> 05:38:59,940
Like, what do we do about that?

4885
05:39:00,540 --> 05:39:02,460
Like, he's still gonna be hungry, right?

4886
05:39:05,180 --> 05:39:12,040
there you are at last you might have kept me searching for a
while yet that you found such a secure hiding point amid

4887
05:39:12,040 --> 05:39:24,900
those shadows it sure took you long enough i was getting to
think oh there she is that's me that is precisely what your

4888
05:39:24,900 --> 05:39:34,520
father said no one in hell wears shoes well how are we to
suffer through another round no this game is too easy tell

4889
05:39:34,520 --> 05:39:43,140
me another one of your tales about the golden age perhaps
when you are older lest your father be displeased if you

4890
05:39:43,140 --> 05:39:55,260
defy him you merely get a mild reprimand if i defy him i get
cut to little bite-sized bits oh okay i mean that's a child

4891
05:39:55,260 --> 05:40:08,300
but okay oh she's like ew that's gross grandpa that's not
gonna happen Spoken with the generosity of youth.

4892
05:40:09,120 --> 05:40:10,520
You are the only one around here.

4893
05:40:11,140 --> 05:40:12,120
Aww, I'm her favorite.

4894
05:40:15,120 --> 05:40:17,580
But don't see others like you, Grandfather.

4895
05:40:17,740 --> 05:40:18,240
Aww.

4896
05:40:19,740 --> 05:40:22,340
Oh, they can never get enough of me, my girl.

4897
05:40:22,640 --> 05:40:25,320
Except we still have had our differences.

4898
05:40:26,020 --> 05:40:27,820
But let me not concern you with the past.

4899
05:40:28,440 --> 05:40:30,540
The only time that matters is right now.

4900
05:40:31,080 --> 05:40:32,900
And right now...

4901
05:40:34,980 --> 05:40:36,560
You are it!

4902
05:40:37,600 --> 05:40:38,820
Oh my god, I did it!

4903
05:40:38,980 --> 05:40:40,040
I won the game!

4904
05:40:41,740 --> 05:40:43,580
Is this the future?

4905
05:40:44,580 --> 05:40:45,860
Or is it the past?

4906
05:40:46,820 --> 05:40:49,340
Not merely mine, but yours, granddaughter.

4907
05:40:50,400 --> 05:40:51,880
Everybody in this house.

4908
05:40:56,390 --> 05:40:56,630
What?

4909
05:40:58,850 --> 05:41:01,050
Wasn't this create a paradox?

4910
05:41:02,790 --> 05:41:04,790
Ah, that's cute!

4911
05:41:10,230 --> 05:41:12,810
Oh my god, I'm getting better.

4912
05:41:13,630 --> 05:41:15,430
I get to keep my arm!

4913
05:41:17,070 --> 05:41:18,090
Oh he's still sleeping.

4914
05:41:23,540 --> 05:41:24,980
Yeah, this has to be another timeline.

4915
05:41:29,040 --> 05:41:30,300
Oh, I'm learning history.

4916
05:41:30,740 --> 05:41:31,480
I'm grandfappy.

4917
05:41:35,540 --> 05:41:38,560
Oh, I'm talking to Zagreus' many girlfriends now.

4918
05:41:39,440 --> 05:41:40,700
I finally won!

4919
05:41:41,780 --> 05:41:45,180
Oh my god, he lost to a child!

4920
05:41:45,320 --> 05:41:46,860
That's embarrassing, bro.

4921
05:42:00,060 --> 05:42:00,620
Oh!

4922
05:42:01,600 --> 05:42:05,940
I'm learning from my step, my other mom.

4923
05:42:12,710 --> 05:42:13,270
Huh?

4924
05:42:13,530 --> 05:42:16,230
My life, the way it could have been.

4925
05:42:16,630 --> 05:42:16,730
Oh.

4926
05:42:17,570 --> 05:42:21,150
Oh gods, Zagreus, did it work?

4927
05:42:21,310 --> 05:42:22,690
No, I still lost my other arm.

4928
05:42:22,710 --> 05:42:23,550
It's been one up there.

4929
05:42:24,850 --> 05:42:25,370
What?

4930
05:42:26,650 --> 05:42:28,170
I mean, I still have my other arm.

4931
05:42:28,310 --> 05:42:29,390
I don't know if it worked.

4932
05:42:39,600 --> 05:42:43,380
Prepare to suffer for all that you've done, Wretch.

4933
05:42:44,200 --> 05:42:49,900
Or shall I stay my hand merely because you made the mistake
of loosening your hold on me?

4934
05:42:52,820 --> 05:42:55,780
All of these newfound thoughts.

4935
05:42:55,880 --> 05:42:56,100
Oh.

4936
05:42:56,580 --> 05:42:57,840
Look at my mind.

4937
05:42:59,100 --> 05:43:14,680
all of this you're doing which i have no memory of you and
yet who are you chronos head mistress wait i can i think i

4938
05:43:14,680 --> 05:43:23,560

that our enemy invaded arabus the next i know he's grobbling

4939
05:43:23,560 --> 05:43:33,940

Headmistress, you don't remember because you weren't there

4940
05:43:33,940 --> 05:43:34,500
with me.

4941
05:43:35,320 --> 05:43:38,140
But as for you, Kronos, who am I now to you?

4942
05:43:40,680 --> 05:43:49,480
You are my granddaughter, Melinui, whom I know both from
this life and an altogether different one.

4943
05:43:50,380 --> 05:43:51,860
I created a parallel...

4944
05:43:53,300 --> 05:43:56,240
I created a parallel universe, a timeline.

4945
05:43:59,100 --> 05:44:12,520
is this so i created a parallel timeline all that you see is
what you wrote as for this other life how much of it do you

4946
05:44:12,520 --> 05:44:24,380
recall yeah your youth here in this house with me are you
delighted in a hiding game when you were but a girl have you

05:44:24,380 --> 05:44:33,420

fought this very night i did not realize there could have

4948
05:44:33,420 --> 05:44:46,940
been this other past we shared this better past oh we merged
the timeline we synced it up now he has feelings nonsense

05:44:46,940 --> 05:44:58,900
none of it occurred nothing has changed you should be gone
Titan not flooded with false memories all these memories

4950
05:44:58,900 --> 05:45:09,140
that spring to his mind I remember them as well a life I
could have lived had the Titan never struck but I struck

4951
05:45:09,140 --> 05:45:18,200
ever hated and shunned finish what you set your mind to
grand altar I have no desire to exist in such a world with

all of you like this oh no he's like I was happy oh silence

let me prove this to you chronos grandfather listen to me

4954

family from your hold it's like i could actually have love

4955
05:45:56,700 --> 05:46:04,020

boy.

4956
05:46:04,320 --> 05:46:05,120
What the fuck?

4957
05:46:08,000 --> 05:46:09,320
Wait, is he also?

4958
05:46:09,580 --> 05:46:10,020
My family.

4959
05:46:10,960 --> 05:46:11,720
Where are we?

4960
05:46:12,500 --> 05:46:14,420
Is this my house?

4961
05:46:15,220 --> 05:46:18,000
Father, what is the meaning of all this?

4962
05:46:18,220 --> 05:46:19,600
Yes, he feels guilt now.

4963
05:46:19,680 --> 05:46:21,280
He's no longer a sociopath.

4964
05:46:21,600 --> 05:46:22,140
Yippee!

4965
05:46:25,340 --> 05:46:26,520
Oh, Hades.

4966
05:46:27,260 --> 05:46:29,080
Perhaps the princess can explain.

4967
05:46:29,820 --> 05:46:32,080
As for the queen and prince and all the rest.

4968
05:46:36,400 --> 05:46:38,040
He's scared now.

4969
05:46:38,300 --> 05:46:39,160
We fixed him.

4970
05:46:39,180 --> 05:46:40,800
I told you we can fix him.

4971
05:46:49,500 --> 05:46:49,760
What?

4972
05:46:58,960 --> 05:47:00,260
What is Warren?

4973
05:47:01,340 --> 05:47:03,160
What happens if I warn him?

4974
05:47:08,420 --> 05:47:11,140
Does anything bad happens if I do warn?

4975
05:47:16,310 --> 05:47:18,010
I can't speak to anybody.

4976
05:47:20,990 --> 05:47:22,430
Talk to him first.

4977
05:47:23,270 --> 05:47:25,910
Wait, do I release them first or talk to him?

4978
05:47:27,010 --> 05:47:27,790
Which was a...

4979
05:47:27,790 --> 05:47:29,110
He gets one more.

4980
05:47:30,990 --> 05:47:32,350
What do I do first?

4981
05:47:33,190 --> 05:47:34,930
Warn him or...

4982
05:47:35,870 --> 05:47:36,290
Family.

4983
05:47:39,350 --> 05:47:40,730
Just don't do it okay, okay?

4984
05:47:40,890 --> 05:47:42,470
Don't do it again, okay, grandpa.

4985
05:47:44,690 --> 05:47:45,210
Release.

4986
05:47:45,670 --> 05:47:46,230
Warn him.

4987
05:47:46,450 --> 05:47:46,950
Free will.

4988
05:47:48,610 --> 05:47:49,690
Oh, it doesn't matter.

4989
05:47:49,870 --> 05:47:51,090
Okay, I'll warn them.

4990
05:47:51,910 --> 05:47:52,910
They said better work.

4991
05:47:52,930 --> 05:47:54,590
Oh, that's it?

4992
05:47:56,590 --> 05:47:57,410
Okay, I'll release.

4993
05:47:59,950 --> 05:48:00,710
That's it.

4994
05:48:01,110 --> 05:48:02,210
Just better work.

4995
05:48:04,750 --> 05:48:06,450
Okay, I thought it'd be something.

4996
05:48:06,570 --> 05:48:08,430
I thought we had, like, an actual conversation.

4997
05:48:08,770 --> 05:48:08,970
Okay.

4998
05:48:09,350 --> 05:48:10,550
You're all grown up.

4999
05:48:11,310 --> 05:48:13,520
But then, of course you are.

5000
05:48:14,890 --> 05:48:15,470
I...

5001
05:48:15,470 --> 05:48:16,310
Oh, my God.

5002
05:48:16,610 --> 05:48:16,950
Yeah.

5003
05:48:20,030 --> 05:48:21,450
Melina, it's really you.

5004
05:48:22,110 --> 05:48:22,910
You look just like you.

5005
05:48:22,930 --> 05:48:31,050
your nightmare reflection did so long ago before the little
you was even born did we succeed we did it we successfully

5006
05:48:31,050 --> 05:48:41,050
weren't they shall recover give them time and give me death
go on and send me to the blasted void already you son or

5007
05:48:41,050 --> 05:48:48,970
that witch or you granddaughter one of you for i am weary of
it all you long for a world without me it is yours

5008
05:48:50,170 --> 05:48:57,510
grandfather no how could you say that after all we've been
through together i swore you'd be under my protection and oh

5009
05:48:57,510 --> 05:49:09,270
gods what happened to this place i took this place as what
zagreus and ruined it you need not advocate for me again you

5010
05:49:09,270 --> 05:49:20,130
never knew my real self nearly a possibility and nothing
more and you millenoi the thin guy put you through all this

5011
05:49:20,130 --> 05:49:27,270
oh i'm his favorite Oh, wait, that's so sweet.

5012
05:49:28,450 --> 05:49:30,750
I was his favorite in the other timeline.

5013
05:49:31,130 --> 05:49:34,490
So he's like, oh my God, I took your arm.

5014
05:49:34,990 --> 05:49:36,750
No, our families had enough for now.

5015
05:49:37,730 --> 05:49:38,970
Who else recalls what happened?

5016
05:49:39,390 --> 05:49:43,470
Oh, memories as vivid as any you hold dear, but of a
separate life we might have lived.

5017
05:49:44,330 --> 05:49:45,370
Mother, do you remember?

5018
05:49:47,370 --> 05:49:48,410
I do.

5019
05:49:49,150 --> 05:49:52,770
You were insatiably curious as a child.

5020
05:49:52,930 --> 05:49:55,870
and sometimes too much even for me to handle.

5021
05:49:56,410 --> 05:50:00,710
So, Zagreus and Kronos, they often helped take care of you.

5022
05:50:00,850 --> 05:50:02,710
Ekkity's like, why don't I have any memories?

5023
05:50:02,830 --> 05:50:04,530
Because she didn't have to do any of this.

5024
05:50:06,350 --> 05:50:07,890
I, too, remember now.

5025
05:50:08,890 --> 05:50:12,730
That father was with us after Zagreus discovered him and
took him in.

5026
05:50:13,630 --> 05:50:16,490
Yet all the while, I have been a prisoner.

5027
05:50:17,350 --> 05:50:19,830
His prisoner here in this time of ours.

5028
05:50:22,930 --> 05:50:27,450
Stephanie, Lord Hades, do not believe these falsehoods
coursing through your minds.

5029
05:50:28,490 --> 05:50:30,390
Even your son and daughter seem susceptible.

5030
05:50:31,110 --> 05:50:34,010
You all have been manipulated by the Titan spell.

5031
05:50:36,550 --> 05:50:37,870
Headmistress, that's not true.

5032
05:50:38,090 --> 05:50:38,890
Don't you understand?

5033
05:50:39,330 --> 05:50:42,050
The dissolution of time, this is how I manifested it.

5034
05:50:42,810 --> 05:50:46,030
You always said the task was mine, as were the methods I
employed.

5035
05:50:46,930 --> 05:50:48,150
This was the path I chose.

5036
05:50:49,790 --> 05:50:50,770
Then you failed.

5037
05:50:50,890 --> 05:50:51,090
Oh!

5038
05:50:51,790 --> 05:50:52,510
Death to Kronos!

5039
05:50:52,930 --> 05:50:56,550
The one task we had the entire time.

5040
05:50:56,910 --> 05:50:59,690
Possibly have compelled you to take such a course.

5041
05:50:59,810 --> 05:51:01,570
I mean, she is right.

5042
05:51:02,430 --> 05:51:04,710
Literally from birth to now.

5043
05:51:05,090 --> 05:51:06,210
Remember what we had to do?

5044
05:51:06,690 --> 05:51:07,970
Death to Kronos.

5045
05:51:08,210 --> 05:51:10,690
And Melanie was like, okay, but...

5046
05:51:11,630 --> 05:51:14,350
You had one job, Melanie.

5047
05:51:14,870 --> 05:51:17,430
Literally one job.

5048
05:51:19,950 --> 05:51:22,910
Her entire fucking mantra was...

5049
05:51:22,930 --> 05:51:34,590
death the cronus but but i can have a grand papa yeah but
what is oh i i thought it was just stop cronus stop cronus

5050
05:51:34,590 --> 05:51:44,930
stop the cronus your own teachings to think for myself oh
free will it needs to be like free will was a mistake if you

5051
05:51:44,930 --> 05:51:49,690
still believe destroying cronus will make our problems go
away then what are you waiting for

5052
05:51:52,930 --> 05:51:57,370
I shall never forgive this Titan for what he has done.

5053
05:51:58,150 --> 05:52:02,150
To this world, your family, you, or me.

5054
05:52:04,990 --> 05:52:09,830
Dear Hackety, my handmaiden, who said anything about
forgiveness?

5055
05:52:10,910 --> 05:52:12,970
I've never heard such pain in you.

5056
05:52:13,230 --> 05:52:14,630
Therapy to Kronos.

5057
05:52:15,730 --> 05:52:20,930
Just before Kronos struck, your task was to protect our
daughter at all costs.

5058
05:52:21,870 --> 05:52:22,730
And you did.

5059
05:52:22,930 --> 05:52:24,010
You did.

5060
05:52:25,830 --> 05:52:28,290
You know, Debt to Kratos is kind of vague.

5061
05:52:28,410 --> 05:52:29,610
Does she mean therapy?

5062
05:52:32,810 --> 05:52:39,090
In our moment of peril to which of the crossroads?

5063
05:52:39,870 --> 05:52:43,760
For that and for all eternity.

5064
05:52:44,720 --> 05:52:45,980
Well, that's not gonna...

5065
05:52:45,980 --> 05:52:47,180
Bro, she fucking...

5066
05:52:47,180 --> 05:52:49,800
Bro, the heck, she lost everything.

5067
05:52:51,180 --> 05:52:54,540
And she didn't even get to enjoy the good memories or
anything.

5068
05:52:55,260 --> 05:52:56,100
I get it.

5069
05:52:56,160 --> 05:52:57,480
She's like, what the fuck?

5070
05:52:57,680 --> 05:53:01,680
Like, this guy literally killed all our loved ones and
everything and kidnapped.

5071
05:53:01,920 --> 05:53:03,740
He literally kidnapped the fates.

5072
05:53:04,160 --> 05:53:08,580
Like, and killed, like, millions of people on the surface
world.

5073
05:53:10,420 --> 05:53:11,400
Like, I get it.

5074
05:53:11,480 --> 05:53:14,000
I get, like, she's like, what the fuck?

5075
05:53:17,130 --> 05:53:20,330
I did know more than was my charge of king and queen.

5076
05:53:21,330 --> 05:53:23,410
And I remain as ever at your service.

5077
05:53:24,770 --> 05:53:25,730
Well then, Melanoi.

5078
05:53:26,690 --> 05:53:27,290
What now?

5079
05:53:31,570 --> 05:53:31,910
Hmm.

5080
05:53:33,270 --> 05:53:34,190
What do we do?

5081
05:53:34,450 --> 05:53:34,810
What now?

5082
05:53:35,650 --> 05:53:37,310
There is so much to be done.

5083
05:53:38,410 --> 05:53:40,610
Bringing this house to order for one thing.

5084
05:53:41,510 --> 05:53:41,670
Father.

5085
05:53:42,030 --> 05:53:42,610
To be fair.

5086
05:53:43,050 --> 05:53:43,910
Yeah, I'll say to be fair.

5087
05:53:44,110 --> 05:53:45,870
Those are people mortals though.

5088
05:53:45,970 --> 05:53:46,690
They don't matter.

5089
05:53:49,190 --> 05:53:49,570
All right.

5090
05:53:49,730 --> 05:53:51,690
Would you grant me that?

5091
05:53:54,780 --> 05:53:55,220
Granted.

5092
05:53:56,160 --> 05:53:57,680
We're not finished with you, Kronos.

5093
05:53:58,500 --> 05:53:59,680
They say time heals all.

5094
05:53:59,680 --> 05:54:00,880
Oh, we forgive him.

5095
05:54:05,100 --> 05:54:13,980
kronos granted but only this one chance by the grace of the
princess of the underworld so yeah thank you the super chat

5096
05:54:13,980 --> 05:54:23,960
thinking thank you technically she killed the old kronos by
fixing him you would permit me such a chance but i cannot

5097
05:54:23,960 --> 05:54:29,940
change what already occurred cannot undo the unforgivable
decisions i have made

5098
05:54:34,020 --> 05:54:42,100
we're not demanding you move backward we're demanding you
move forward this ending is nice what was the old ending

5099
05:54:42,100 --> 05:54:57,420
like to move forward that is all I have ever known then I
shall make time both for this house and everything then be

5100
05:54:57,420 --> 05:55:05,260
so kind as to get these chains on me so we can get to work
it's just a Oh, we're rebuilding.

5101
05:55:08,260 --> 05:55:09,860
Oh, Melody didn't remember?

5102
05:55:10,720 --> 05:55:12,960
To aid in the recovery of however much.

5103
05:55:12,960 --> 05:55:14,540
No, that seems like a terrible ending.

5104
05:55:15,000 --> 05:55:17,600
They'll be like, they're like, I'll remember all the good
times we had.

5105
05:55:17,700 --> 05:55:18,460
Melody's like, what the fuck?

5106
05:55:18,780 --> 05:55:19,980
I lost an arm.

5107
05:55:21,380 --> 05:55:22,820
What do you mean you remember?

5108
05:55:23,340 --> 05:55:24,740
They're still loyal to their cause.

5109
05:55:25,300 --> 05:55:26,120
Answered the call.

5110
05:55:27,840 --> 05:55:30,740
They and the Titan picked up many pieces of the past.

5111
05:55:33,420 --> 05:55:42,200
the house grew more like how it used to be but then a
summons from olympus arrived and the princess knew her stay

5112
05:55:42,200 --> 05:55:54,260
had reached its end yeah this definitely sounds a lot better
than uh than the old ending it's like does she train for

5113
05:55:54,260 --> 05:55:59,420
this her whole life and then they're like exactly like
sarah's just like um i'm the older brother so we're gonna

5114
05:55:59,420 --> 05:56:08,060
spare grandpa after like after she fucking catches to kill
typhoon seven times and then grandpa like another seven

5115
05:56:08,060 --> 05:56:18,760
times too like i went through a lot i think we can fix up
the rest of this place on our own thank you for all your

5116
05:56:18,760 --> 05:56:26,620
help especially the part where you liberated us from our
temporal prisons and whatnot believe me i had nothing better

5117
05:56:26,620 --> 05:56:32,680
to do anyhow we'll have to find a way to cross paths out
there and each keep an eye on chronos as we tie up some new

5118
05:56:32,680 --> 05:56:40,700
sends everything you did i can't help but be glad we're all
here but that's easy for me to say not having been locked in

5119
05:56:40,700 --> 05:56:49,240
a lifelong conflict i'll manage you helped me realize there
even was a path toward this outcome as i faced oh i might

5120
05:56:49,240 --> 05:56:55,920
have consumed him completely good thing that's impressive
brother sister team past and present real and imagined and

5121
05:56:55,920 --> 05:57:03,000
now we don't even need dream time which magic to stay in
touch no i suppose not feels like we've been through thick

5122
05:57:03,000 --> 05:57:09,480
and thin together doesn't it even without the memories of a
wholly different and generally more pleasant life right now

5123
05:57:09,480 --> 05:57:16,840
I'd simply settle for a calmer one come on you're not the
settling sort anyway I know this isn't goodbye and we'll be

5124
05:57:16,840 --> 05:57:27,700
seeing each other though still oh I'm going back to the
forest I'm gonna live in the forest I'm going to miss you

5125
05:57:27,700 --> 05:57:44,280
too big brother take what but this place looks a lot nicer
but but I could be a princess in a castle oh yeah

5126
05:57:44,280 --> 05:57:52,240
triple-headed monster service rests in his favorite spot oh
to Olympus oh that's fine fuck you guys I'm going to Olympus

5127
05:57:52,240 --> 05:57:59,820
I'm gonna pet the dog I thought he was sending me to the
woods Fuck you guys.

5128
05:57:59,840 --> 05:58:00,440
See you losers.

5129
05:58:00,540 --> 05:58:01,540
I'm going to Olympus.

5130
05:58:03,720 --> 05:58:06,720
Oh, can I pet him now?

5131
05:58:06,880 --> 05:58:08,380
The way my brother demonstrated before.

5132
05:58:10,160 --> 05:58:15,140
Bro, the tier is forest, uh, Hades, and then Olympus.

5133
05:58:16,240 --> 05:58:17,780
Fuck, of course, I'll pick Olympus.

5134
05:58:18,760 --> 05:58:19,040
Yay!

5135
05:58:23,860 --> 05:58:25,520
Aww, that's so cute.

5136
05:58:27,020 --> 05:58:27,500
Hey.

5137
05:58:27,780 --> 05:58:28,780
It's been an honor, sir.

5138
05:58:30,480 --> 05:58:31,500
Why is Achilles?

5139
05:58:32,600 --> 05:58:32,740
I know.

5140
05:58:33,420 --> 05:58:34,660
We'll remember you here, alas.

5141
05:58:34,820 --> 05:58:35,600
Shank his ankles.

5142
05:58:36,020 --> 05:58:37,200
That's how it still feels as if we've only met.

5143
05:58:37,620 --> 05:58:38,100
Shank the heels.

5144
05:58:41,760 --> 05:58:43,060
That is Achilles, sir.

5145
05:58:43,740 --> 05:58:48,800
I have these glimpses now of cherished moments I might have
spent with you and the other house servants had the past but

5146
05:58:48,800 --> 05:58:49,440
gone differently.

5147
05:58:50,060 --> 05:58:51,080
Are the others doing well?

5148
05:58:52,620 --> 05:58:53,760
They seem to be.

5149
05:58:53,920 --> 05:58:58,500
Your relatives recovered the most swiftly, but I think we're
all still feeling some effects.

5150
05:58:59,100 --> 05:59:08,240
and catching up on everything we missed and aiding where we
can i'll miss you all this really does feel like a dream at

5151
05:59:08,240 --> 05:59:16,240
times i fear i may forget it as one tends to do with dreams
i trust you'll still remember what i always told you about

5152
05:59:16,240 --> 05:59:22,640
fear please don't worry and now we may not see you for a
while but i shall await whenever we may meet

5153
05:59:29,240 --> 05:59:30,120
Beautiful daughter.

5154
05:59:30,960 --> 05:59:36,420
We were just talking about you, how you were as a child,
both in this life and the other.

5155
05:59:37,300 --> 05:59:41,320
Growing up is so difficult, and you had to do it twice.

5156
05:59:43,860 --> 05:59:45,760
Which makes me beyond fortunate.

5157
05:59:46,620 --> 05:59:52,780
Peckety was the best caretaker I can imagine, and I'm so
grateful to have experienced a life with you, Mother, where

5158
05:59:52,780 --> 05:59:53,900
there was so much warmth.

5159
05:59:54,800 --> 05:59:56,580
And now you've met this other side of me.

5160
05:59:59,100 --> 06:00:03,320
And I shall eagerly await getting to know this other side of
you even better.

5161
06:00:04,120 --> 06:00:07,540
And Hecate, you're certain it's no burden to me.

5162
06:00:07,560 --> 06:00:08,580
What the fuck?

5163
06:00:08,760 --> 06:00:10,500
To continue looking after her, just in case.

5164
06:00:11,400 --> 06:00:12,160
Wait, what?

5165
06:00:14,720 --> 06:00:15,680
Why is I'm...

5166
06:00:15,680 --> 06:00:16,240
Why am I...

5167
06:00:16,240 --> 06:00:16,500
What?

5168
06:00:19,760 --> 06:00:20,660
Why is she...

5169
06:00:21,500 --> 06:00:22,500
Still doesn't want...

5170
06:00:22,500 --> 06:00:23,240
Does she not love me?

5171
06:00:23,800 --> 06:00:23,820
What?

5172
06:00:25,020 --> 06:00:25,120
What?

5173
06:00:25,680 --> 06:00:25,840
What?

5174
06:00:25,840 --> 06:00:27,220
And I shall always care for her.

5175
06:00:29,100 --> 06:00:40,980
or not yeah i'm like she like had me down like what do you
mean like do you not want to spend time with your daughter

5176
06:00:40,980 --> 06:00:58,860
like you don't even know current me i'm then it's settled
and Malinui for what it's worth I likewise back to boarding

5177
06:00:58,860 --> 06:01:13,490
school please reconsider this Malinui you cannot be yeah
yeah Malinui what the fuck you not want to like like bond

5178
06:01:13,490 --> 06:01:25,310
with your fucking mom after like never being with her the
unseen is to serve in shadow I know full well had mr.

5179
06:01:25,330 --> 06:01:35,730
and do not make this decision lightly but I can't leave the
crossroads oh my god there's so much left to do okay I mean

5180
06:01:35,730 --> 06:01:45,410
I wouldn't make that decision but free will I guess working
with Kronos on this new venture of his you've been

5181
06:01:45,410 --> 06:01:55,110
instrumental in altering time as we know it so you're
certainly the best fit to keep things that way ensuring time

5182
06:01:55,110 --> 06:02:01,150
keeps working in our favor seems like a good way to spend my
own time it should be interesting and the matter is close to

5183
06:02:01,150 --> 06:02:11,190
my heart perhaps i was born for this you were born for much
more but we'll do our share yeah the fair child prefers the

5184
06:02:11,190 --> 06:02:21,810
wood she's too used to shitting in the forest i guess as for
your brother well he always turns up this is going to be an

5185
06:02:21,810 --> 06:02:25,090
adjustment though isn't it even if i'll see you all again
soon

5186
06:02:28,430 --> 06:02:37,430
an adjustment is putting it mildly now go make your rounds
and i'll see you off before you depart i love you baby girl

5187
06:02:37,430 --> 06:02:45,750
i think that's just a little bit of a plot hole there i feel
like you know after your entire life in the current

5188
06:02:45,750 --> 06:02:53,110
iteration of you in this current time like you never got
fucking grow up with your parents or your family and you're

5189
06:02:53,110 --> 06:03:00,490
like yeah i'm gonna stay in the that just feels off that i
that that's the only thing i have graves about i love you

5190
06:03:00,490 --> 06:03:11,490
too mother that's the only thing i'm like that's weird
that's a weird choice when i was having difficulties with my

5191
06:03:11,490 --> 06:03:21,090
son sometimes i thought of you father i cannot fathom having
had more children to contend yeah but experienced it though

5192
06:03:21,090 --> 06:03:33,190
so um her mom never got to experience the melody now that
spent her entire life growing up in the forest yes well i

5193
06:03:33,190 --> 06:03:40,730
was not terribly successful at contending with you a lot now
was i it took little you look so much nicer now see him and

5194
06:03:40,730 --> 06:03:52,710
the others again soon after like being cured from i guess
being a sociopath not reach mount olympus it seems but zoos

5195
06:03:52,710 --> 06:04:03,410
does have my full report yeah ringing endorsement is his
lips bigger too if time can be so cruel then it is only

5196
06:04:03,410 --> 06:04:10,810
fitting for his children he's been like would you not agree
grand altar he's been like what's it called looks maxing he

5197
06:04:10,810 --> 06:04:22,730
looks like he's been looks maxing bro apparently if you i
was okay i'm sorry i'm this is like um i'm ruining the

5198
06:04:22,730 --> 06:04:31,950
immersion of the story yeah but apparently there's like this
trend of is it called looks maxing uh or muing or whatever

5199
06:04:31,950 --> 06:04:37,910
apparently there's like drugs and stuff that you take for it
and like there's this guy that's talking about how he's like

5200
06:04:37,910 --> 06:04:43,810
yeah bro i'm fucking committed to this looks maxing like and
then apparently it makes you like infertile

5201
06:04:47,290 --> 06:04:52,290
Yeah, to get like the perfect looks- looks maxing.

5202
06:04:54,610 --> 06:04:57,290
We may have more in common than we'd like to admit.

5203
06:04:58,130 --> 06:05:00,630
But in any event, Lord Uncle Zeus asked you to come alone.

5204
06:05:01,170 --> 06:05:03,130
Only the fates now know what lies in store.

5205
06:05:03,810 --> 06:05:06,810
Although there's still no sign of them, even with Nix's aid.

5206
06:05:14,680 --> 06:05:17,460
Yeah, we- I cast them into the abyss.

5207
06:05:18,300 --> 06:05:24,980
Had I known precisely where they would have known how to get
back, yet if my hypothesis at such possibilities oh they you

5208
06:05:24,980 --> 06:05:39,840
threw them in the abyss we may fight them oh jesus he just
throws them into the fucking pit we shall and i look forward

5209
06:05:39,840 --> 06:05:49,220
to testing this hypothesis perhaps we'll all learn something
about ourselves jesus would that we could gods and titans

5210
06:05:49,220 --> 06:06:00,920
yeah literally chucked them into the void but we need not be
bound to why old ways indeed um father thank you for all

5211
06:06:00,920 --> 06:06:10,220
your hospitality it gladdens me to see you doing well i
would not be if not for my god i trust that we should no

5212
06:06:10,220 --> 06:06:19,640
longer looks like he's homeless let's go perhaps even you
father likewise hiddies at least this house is mostly to

5213
06:06:19,640 --> 06:06:28,980
your preference again beyond these halls of course more is
to be done yes well father i wish you the best with the

5214
06:06:28,980 --> 06:06:36,940
ongoing underworld renovations as for us our chariot is here
let's shop thank you for the super chat that you think this

5215
06:06:36,940 --> 06:06:45,760
is such a wholesome family ending except for the mortals
we're still dead that it is i am prepared i don't think the

5216
06:06:45,760 --> 06:06:52,660
gods care about the mortals anyway They were literally mad
that they got fire.

5217
06:06:53,920 --> 06:06:56,440
Like, how fucking dare you give them fire?

5218
06:06:56,860 --> 06:06:57,560
Great mix.

5219
06:06:58,300 --> 06:06:58,500
Oh, yeah.

5220
06:06:59,920 --> 06:07:01,440
Oh, night and moon.

5221
06:07:02,840 --> 06:07:04,220
My third mom.

5222
06:07:04,680 --> 06:07:07,440
Mom remains secure in keeping watch above it all.

5223
06:07:08,220 --> 06:07:10,080
I never doubted that I could count on you.

5224
06:07:11,420 --> 06:07:16,220
But mother, had our watch been more dependable than none of
this would have transpired.

5225
06:07:18,000 --> 06:07:27,480
trying times shall always come about testing our resolve
thus we grow strong as do the bonds we share even now i

5226
06:07:27,480 --> 06:07:34,440
sense the powerful connection between you oh look there's
your voice of the underworld it was my honor to work with

5227
06:07:34,440 --> 06:07:43,260
sister selenia o'nix she has always been my guiding light
except for my last fucking run apparently he's like he's

5228
06:07:43,260 --> 06:07:51,520
always been my oh always literally my last run i didn't even
see her

5229
06:07:57,200 --> 06:08:03,720
that's crazy oh with his side eyes

5230
06:08:08,860 --> 06:08:17,680
thank you mother and farewell for now i must say i did not
expect that we could ever draw you down this far sister

5231
06:08:17,680 --> 06:08:21,420
selenie i thought perhaps not even had mr code in all her
experience.

5232
06:08:24,400 --> 06:08:25,140
Oh, hey, hey, Kati.

5233
06:08:25,820 --> 06:08:26,140
Oh, hey.

5234
06:08:26,140 --> 06:08:32,180
If you are ready, little star, then let us go, lest we
outstay our greetings and farewells.

5235
06:08:32,720 --> 06:08:39,120
I am honored to have seen these halls and to return to
shadow with you on this night in victory, not haste.

5236
06:08:39,820 --> 06:08:44,400
I will say this entire time, I am so confused with what her
head is.

5237
06:08:44,960 --> 06:08:47,200
Like, is that a helmet?

5238
06:08:48,600 --> 06:08:50,000
Or, like, hair.

5239
06:08:51,420 --> 06:09:03,160
I miss oh my god it's a helmet wait I see it now I I'm this
the head this is like the it's so confusing I thought it was

5240
06:09:03,160 --> 06:09:13,640
literally like hair for the longest time but like very ugly
hairstyle yeah I I can see it now I see it now I was just

5241
06:09:13,640 --> 06:09:27,000
like I I've noticed the blue blue I thought the blue thing
wave thingy was just aura yeah yeah i i just realized that

5242
06:09:27,000 --> 06:09:36,260
it wasn't aura it's like like the moon aura you know because
she you can finally see her fucking um sprite like the in

5243
06:09:36,260 --> 06:09:37,120
the background

5244
06:09:42,580 --> 06:09:46,800
yeah yeah i noticed it now i can i can see the hair now.

5245
06:09:48,520 --> 06:09:54,640
Come, Malinoi, for all the reasons that Salini says, we have
a delivery that we must make besides.

5246
06:09:57,080 --> 06:09:58,300
Then let's be off.

5247
06:09:58,580 --> 06:10:02,320
I think the helmet is definitely not very appealing, I will
say that.

5248
06:10:03,540 --> 06:10:08,840
I just always thought I was just like, I was like,
everything else looks beautiful, but I was like, bro, that

5249
06:10:08,840 --> 06:10:10,480
hair needs to go.

5250
06:10:11,220 --> 06:10:13,400
Then let us ride into the dark above.

5251
06:10:13,400 --> 06:10:17,000
And do be careful to hold on as we depart.

5252
06:10:18,280 --> 06:10:18,900
Farewell.

5253
06:10:19,320 --> 06:10:19,640
Bye.

5254
06:10:20,420 --> 06:10:21,060
Farewell.

5255
06:10:21,460 --> 06:10:24,600
Yeah, we're going to Olympus.

5256
06:10:26,120 --> 06:10:26,700
Yeah.

5257
06:10:29,080 --> 06:10:31,160
You get to fly like this each night.

5258
06:10:33,760 --> 06:10:39,240
If I may briefly interrupt, we have arrived at our initial
destination, everyone.

5259
06:10:39,740 --> 06:10:41,540
Olympus is not far from here.

5260
06:10:43,400 --> 06:10:47,160
I do appreciate the ride upon your gleaming chariot, O moon.

5261
06:10:47,660 --> 06:10:49,300
But it is time for me to go.

5262
06:10:50,180 --> 06:10:54,180
Perhaps my conversations with Hades have prepared me to face
my other sons.

5263
06:10:55,560 --> 06:10:59,240
We've informed Lord Uncle Zeus of what happened and given
our recommendations.

5264
06:10:59,760 --> 06:11:01,500
Though he'll have many questions for you.

5265
06:11:01,900 --> 06:11:03,240
And ought to be expecting you by now.

5266
06:11:03,800 --> 06:11:05,680
Remember the chance you've been given, Grandfather.

5267
06:11:05,900 --> 06:11:07,080
I'm not coming with you.

5268
06:11:08,500 --> 06:11:09,740
Time cannot forget.

5269
06:11:10,540 --> 06:11:12,100
And ought to never to be late.

5270
06:11:13,400 --> 06:11:21,880
at least permit me to assist you from here on knowing there
were real possibilities this all could have gone worse to

5271
06:11:21,880 --> 06:11:29,100
think that the entire flow of time has fractured because of
what occurred i would liken it more to a moment of

5272
06:11:29,100 --> 06:11:37,220
self-discovery on my part despite my advanced stage it seems
i did not know all that there is to know about myself but

5273
06:11:37,220 --> 06:11:43,940
then again who does now farewell wait and thank you grand
altar Wait, no.

5274
06:11:44,440 --> 06:11:46,160
Bring me with you to Olympus.

5275
06:11:47,060 --> 06:11:47,460
Hello?

5276
06:11:49,520 --> 06:11:50,060
Oh, oh,

5277
06:11:55,420 --> 06:11:56,680
oh, oh, oh, hello.

5278
06:11:57,060 --> 06:11:57,960
Thought we'd drop in.

5279
06:11:58,180 --> 06:11:58,520
Oh, hey.

5280
06:11:59,240 --> 06:12:01,120
Lord Apollo and Lady Artemis.

5281
06:12:03,900 --> 06:12:05,880
It's a beautiful night, Lady Selene.

5282
06:12:06,420 --> 06:12:08,820
And you must be the esteemed witch of the Crossroads.

5283
06:12:09,400 --> 06:12:14,300
You've trained my cousin very well indeed to have brought
Kronos to our heights, still in one piece.

5284
06:12:16,180 --> 06:12:17,120
Fine, Apollo.

5285
06:12:17,320 --> 06:12:18,640
I was incorrect for once.

5286
06:12:18,900 --> 06:12:19,880
No need to boast.

5287
06:12:20,500 --> 06:12:24,480
Malinui, I may have wagered that you'd cut the Titan to
ribbons sooner than you'd bring him here.

5288
06:12:26,180 --> 06:12:28,460
I know it's unimaginable, but he came here willingly.

5289
06:12:28,960 --> 06:12:30,800
And Lord Zeus wanted to speak to him in private.

5290
06:12:31,480 --> 06:12:33,880
Wait, does that mean you were kicked out of your house?

5291
06:12:34,280 --> 06:12:34,620
Huh?

5292
06:12:35,740 --> 06:12:38,600
Well, we consider it a palace, but, uh, no.

5293
06:12:39,120 --> 06:12:43,000
No, we've been appointed to escort you to the crossroads as
a symbol of our family's unity.

5294
06:12:45,740 --> 06:12:46,620
Okay.

5295
06:12:49,220 --> 06:12:49,880
We ride.

5296
06:12:50,800 --> 06:12:51,380
Here we go.

5297
06:12:52,600 --> 06:12:52,700
Yay.

5298
06:12:55,380 --> 06:12:57,640
We did it!

5299
06:13:00,280 --> 06:13:04,500
Guys, we fucking finally beat Hades!

5300
06:13:05,600 --> 06:13:07,040
Oh my god.

5301
06:13:08,680 --> 06:13:10,060
Oh my god.

5302
06:13:10,760 --> 06:13:12,320
What a wild ride.

5303
06:13:13,400 --> 06:13:23,780
I mean, I would like to move to Olympus, but okay, or you
know live back home with my family, but Guess I'll be in the

5304
06:13:23,780 --> 06:13:26,100
I'm back in the forest now

5305
06:13:29,160 --> 06:13:32,340
Yeah, I finished the tutorial guys we finally did it

5306
06:13:35,820 --> 06:13:44,420
That was fun though, I've always loved I love roguelike so
much so Obviously, hey these two scratch that itch for me

5307
06:13:45,380 --> 06:13:47,440
Um, so it's a very fun experience.

5308
06:13:47,760 --> 06:13:54,040
Um, no, not now, but no, no, no, no, no, there is no there's
no true ending time.

5309
06:13:57,440 --> 06:14:05,740
I will say I think I think it's weird that I'm still in the
forest.

5310
06:14:06,040 --> 06:14:11,220
I feel like he needs one or two more.

5311
06:14:14,060 --> 06:14:20,580
There's like Okay, in Hades 1, I had less things to complain
about.

5312
06:14:21,340 --> 06:14:30,040
But in Hades 2, like, they've added so much more to Hades 1,
expanded a lot upon it.

5313
06:14:30,520 --> 06:14:34,680
But I really, really did not like the Ares Edition.

5314
06:14:35,820 --> 06:14:37,220
Fuck that shit.

5315
06:14:39,020 --> 06:14:45,320
Yeah, I think I will say I like Hades 1's story more.

5316
06:14:45,340 --> 06:15:00,460
I would like that and I hate Fighting Typhon seven times
Because like Kronos I get it because Kronos is a lot easier

5317
06:15:00,460 --> 06:15:15,040
Like the The the hell The underworld levels are so easy That
like the Kronos level I don't mind grinding that shit But

5318
06:15:15,340 --> 06:15:16,720
The typhoon ship?

5319
06:15:16,860 --> 06:15:18,040
No, fuck that.

5320
06:15:22,130 --> 06:15:22,650
Yeah.

5321
06:15:26,370 --> 06:15:29,050
Yeah, I was not a huge fan.

5322
06:15:29,410 --> 06:15:37,030
Because, like, the thing is, for Kronos, this is the
underground, for the underworld, like, all the bosses, like,

5323
06:15:37,050 --> 06:15:39,170
when you get a hang of it, all the bosses are pretty easy.

5324
06:15:39,430 --> 06:15:40,950
It's just Kronos at the end.

5325
06:15:41,390 --> 06:15:48,350
But for the surface one, it's, it's, like, all the, like,
it's, like, Ares, Prometheus.

5326
06:15:48,370 --> 06:15:55,770
theus and Typhon like back to back to back as like it's
frustrating as hell

5327
06:16:04,450 --> 06:16:14,030
yeah just to get the first ending I feel like for the first
ending it should be like a little easier

5328
06:16:17,370 --> 06:16:27,450
I as wish like the first ending was not like that much
grinding for the surface level I won't say, okay, easier is

5329
06:16:27,450 --> 06:16:28,110
not the right word.

5330
06:16:28,450 --> 06:16:35,770
Just, it was, just too much, too much fucking runs for the
surface level.

5331
06:16:41,870 --> 06:16:46,090
I just, I just don't like, I just didn't like that to fight
Typhon six times.

5332
06:16:50,020 --> 06:16:51,860
It's just Typhon.

5333
06:16:52,500 --> 06:16:59,080
It's Typhon, Aeris, and Prometheus back to back.

5334
06:16:59,320 --> 06:17:00,380
Fuck those guys.

5335
06:17:01,320 --> 06:17:02,900
And this fucking eagle.

5336
06:17:03,160 --> 06:17:05,420
Oh, I don't think I didn't forget about the goddamn eagle.

5337
06:17:05,980 --> 06:17:07,200
Fuck that bird.

5338
06:17:16,410 --> 06:17:16,930
God!

5339
06:17:24,580 --> 06:17:27,340
Yeah, no, that eagle was goddamn annoying.

5340
06:17:28,380 --> 06:17:30,160
The gameplay was fun, though.

5341
06:17:30,220 --> 06:17:31,860
The gameplay was really fun.

5342
06:17:33,840 --> 06:17:38,320
Also, fuck Zeus for, like, just throwing a thunderbolt and
be like, I did all we could.

5343
06:17:39,800 --> 06:17:41,700
Because at least, like, in the...

5344
06:17:41,720 --> 06:17:48,880
story of one it made like it made more sense but then in two
i'm like why why the fuck aren't you guys helping we're

5345
06:17:48,880 --> 06:17:58,120
literally at olympus like like i don't need to borrow your
powers you can use your powers right now we're outside your

5355
06:19:10,880 --> 06:19:12,240
I said we're not finished.

5356
06:19:15,260 --> 06:19:16,560
Oh, do I no longer brood?

5357
06:19:17,040 --> 06:19:18,080
I'm happy now.

5358
06:19:19,640 --> 06:19:21,160
I don't think I forgot about you, little one.

5359
06:19:21,780 --> 06:19:23,520
I didn't even bring my frog back home.

5360
06:19:23,620 --> 06:19:24,860
I left him in the forest.

5361
06:19:26,460 --> 06:19:27,580
Hello, I did my job.

5362
06:19:28,260 --> 06:19:30,300
Hey, so what exactly happened around here?

5363
06:19:30,500 --> 06:19:31,520
Chop, chop done.

5364
06:19:31,820 --> 06:19:32,620
Chop done.

5365
06:19:33,540 --> 06:19:34,780
Because that's what I'm hearing.

5366
06:19:34,800 --> 06:19:42,940
from the other shades joki hates eagles that's what's
happening she hates america it's a broken pot thank you the

5367
06:19:42,940 --> 06:19:51,120
super chat thank you that eagle isn't even american my
brother's back too but we have many details to sort out and

5368
06:19:51,120 --> 06:19:53,340
he doesn't even live in america

5369
06:19:56,700 --> 06:20:03,700
the titan you said you were going to slay this whole time
assisting us hate to say it mel but sounds to me yeah that

5370
06:20:03,700 --> 06:20:13,590
was neat that they had home we're narrating all of this
because he is like the uh uh the writer he's no longer

5371
06:20:13,590 --> 06:20:22,010
himself or rather no longer the way he used to be and we'll
be closely watching him sure so then congratulations are in

5372
06:20:22,010 --> 06:20:32,350
order basically well if you like what i do i don't think
america was discovered yet back then guys i have a feeling

5373
06:20:33,850 --> 06:20:34,890
So what do I...

5374
06:20:34,890 --> 06:20:36,410
So how is he still fighting?

5375
06:20:38,410 --> 06:20:39,570
I'm a little confused.

5376
06:20:39,730 --> 06:20:42,350
How is he still fighting if...

5377
06:20:44,170 --> 06:20:46,990
Alright, I guess I'll collect your trash again.

5378
06:20:48,950 --> 06:20:49,990
I guess...

5379
06:20:49,990 --> 06:20:51,930
It's your local trash collector.

5380
06:20:52,830 --> 06:20:53,990
The Krono stuff I'm hearing?

5381
06:20:54,270 --> 06:20:55,430
He's really calling it quits?

5382
06:20:55,710 --> 06:20:57,250
And he let Nixon everybody off?

5383
06:20:57,570 --> 06:20:58,930
What did you do to him?

5384
06:21:01,270 --> 06:21:02,330
Wait, why do I...

5385
06:21:02,350 --> 06:21:09,950
fight chronos then in the underworld oh alternate versions
of them oh

5386
06:21:15,150 --> 06:21:22,930
my concern is that you ruined everything so now we'll all
have peace and harmony joy yeah apologies promises to never

5387
06:21:22,930 --> 06:21:32,890
let this type of thing happen again have you met our
families aris it's never that simple it better not be or

5388
06:21:32,890 --> 06:21:33,970
i'll never forgive you you.

5389
06:21:34,850 --> 06:21:36,550
Your task is finally complete.

5390
06:21:36,750 --> 06:21:37,330
I did it, yeah.

5391
06:21:37,810 --> 06:21:38,850
Perhaps the fates knew you'd succeed.

5392
06:21:39,530 --> 06:21:40,730
But I couldn't always be certain.

5393
06:21:41,270 --> 06:21:43,230
Although I held to what could be considered hope.

5394
06:21:45,110 --> 06:21:47,230
And your support made it possible, Lord Moros.

5395
06:21:47,630 --> 06:21:52,510
For one thing, if you hadn't intervened when I was trying to
reach the surface, Typhon might have reduced Olympus to

5396
06:21:52,510 --> 06:21:52,850
ruin.

5397
06:21:54,050 --> 06:21:56,190
Next, see, thank you, thank you, thank you.

5398
06:21:56,350 --> 06:21:56,830
So true.

5399
06:21:57,050 --> 06:21:57,890
She's angry.

5400
06:21:58,970 --> 06:22:00,470
That makes me happy.

5401
06:22:01,170 --> 06:22:02,290
The feud continues.

5402
06:22:03,290 --> 06:22:04,730
We'll never have a truce.

5403
06:22:10,590 --> 06:22:11,230
Oh,

5404
06:22:26,590 --> 06:22:26,590
hey.

5405
06:22:27,190 --> 06:22:28,330
I can make more stuff.

5406
06:22:31,130 --> 06:22:33,790
I don't really need any of these things to be found.

5407
06:22:33,810 --> 06:22:43,590
bear all hail the princess of the oh my gosh still it's
still growing that into the not expected to still be growing

5408
06:22:43,590 --> 06:22:50,570
it's like in the other story it's just nothing else i mean
okay i might as well

5409
06:22:53,970 --> 06:23:05,330
see that sisters how are you faring lately head mistress
you've been well more reserved than i the house of Hades you

5410
06:23:05,330 --> 06:23:15,050
said we'd speak more later how soon later turns to now look
Melinaway I ought to be in a more celebratory mood given

5411
06:23:15,050 --> 06:23:22,570
what you finally achieved I am above all very proud of yay
being back at the house awakened memories that ought to

5412
06:23:22,570 --> 06:23:31,690
remain dormant even though you got to see mother and father
again and Nix they were so grateful to you I could tell I am

5413
06:23:31,690 --> 06:23:37,490
so grateful to you Things may not have gone precisely as we
planned, but the result is what we sought, isn't it?

5414
06:23:37,510 --> 06:23:37,830
Yeah.

5415
06:23:39,330 --> 06:23:42,010
I mean, her result was deaf to Kronos.

5416
06:23:45,750 --> 06:23:47,330
You refer to Kronos.

5417
06:23:48,210 --> 06:23:48,970
Yeah, yeah, see?

5418
06:23:49,070 --> 06:23:52,690
She's like, um, I wanted her to be dead.

5419
06:23:54,450 --> 06:23:57,310
I am attempting still to draw back to the hand.

5420
06:23:57,470 --> 06:24:00,850
I get you ahead, close enough.

5421
06:24:04,070 --> 06:24:12,930
I remember you once told me that destroying Kronos would not
change the past and that the pain would linger And I was

5422
06:24:12,930 --> 06:24:22,370
probably correct yet we cannot help but reassess the turns
our lives take Through our own choices and otherwise Anyhow

5423
06:24:22,370 --> 06:24:24,110
are you prepared to carry on?

5424
06:24:24,570 --> 06:24:29,350
Yeah Nearly so retracing my steps should be interesting

5425
06:24:33,330 --> 06:24:42,810
all right who else wants to talk to me all right nemesis got
your mom back welcome after the titan got her eye ought to

5426
06:24:42,810 --> 06:24:50,370
have taken guard duty more seriously and won't soon forgive
myself as all headmistress would only want for you to learn

5427
06:24:50,370 --> 06:24:59,050
from it i half wonder if she let herself be taken just to
get closer to our mark perhaps go speak with her yeah and

5428
06:24:59,050 --> 06:25:07,070
what of chronos heard he isn't but he's cheering for you
then he's dead and gone in the sense that we have

5429
06:25:07,070 --> 06:25:12,030
neutralized the threat he posed I now shall have to grow
accustomed to having him as a grandfather rather than a

5430
06:25:12,030 --> 06:25:17,470
hated foe oh is that girl thank you listen richard thank you
thank you didn't get game of the year because there was

5431
06:25:17,470 --> 06:25:23,630
enough moments where our favorite the Lulu queen's yellow
don't see why he can't be both this was never part of the

5432
06:25:23,630 --> 06:25:31,270
task and not like you to stray from the I think they didn't
get game in the year because there's no Perry they couldn't

5433
06:25:33,690 --> 06:25:41,590
headmistress sealed his strongest powers just in case at any
rate we did it them then how come you look like you're

5434
06:25:41,590 --> 06:25:53,210
headed out again or there's still more time related business
to sort out well yes but what not done you found a path to

5435
06:25:53,210 --> 06:26:00,510
victory and got us there wouldn't have been much of a plan
and lack of French improvise of course our plan now also has

5436
06:26:00,510 --> 06:26:02,210
this other phase as a result

5437
06:26:06,190 --> 06:26:13,430
cleaning up after cronos we all thought i would get rid of
him but i found another way what one i think shall leave my

5438
06:26:13,430 --> 06:26:21,310
family better off if not the rest of the world eventually oh
yeah yeah yeah i well i thought he was talking they were

5439
06:26:21,310 --> 06:26:27,310
talking about like a different cronos your choice was wise
oh yeah no i get it what's next everything is ready for you

5440
06:26:27,310 --> 06:26:34,670
to proceed if and when you are eliminating real
possibilities that we could have failed oh there you go here

5441
06:26:34,670 --> 06:26:42,310
you go as Kronos puts it I don't quite know what to expect
but the change we're fighting that's like unlimited though

5442
06:26:42,310 --> 06:26:53,390
what do you make of it you can never there's unlimited
possibilities we can never get rid of it to try to the

5443
06:26:53,390 --> 06:27:03,650
extent you had other matters to resolve to do so and we'll
always be anticipating your return then let's give it a go

5444
06:27:03,650 --> 06:27:13,390
is he awake yet all right my memories of you from that
potential past i experienced in the house of hades you were

5445
06:27:13,390 --> 06:27:24,830
so different lord hypnos who are you truly how can i finally
get through to you will he ever wake up is he like in the

5446
06:27:24,830 --> 06:27:35,490
coma forever all right time to put grandfather's theories to
the test the only question is where to begin the group with

5447
06:27:35,490 --> 06:27:50,750
Kronos both above and okay we are not doing that we what do
you mean regroup with Kronos both up no no this is it's only

5448
06:27:50,750 --> 06:28:02,830
you're We'll talk to him one last time.

5449
06:28:09,750 --> 06:28:19,730
I want you to stroke my ego one last time.

5450
06:28:20,910 --> 06:28:21,710
Thank you very much, Commander.

5451
06:28:22,190 --> 06:28:23,770
Though, what are you still doing here?

5452
06:28:24,090 --> 06:28:26,810
I kept expecting you to return to your honorary post at the
house.

5453
06:28:27,170 --> 06:28:28,410
but eventually I had to depart.

5454
06:28:30,850 --> 06:28:33,110
Well, you are not exactly done with everything, are you?

5455
06:28:33,390 --> 06:28:36,550
I see your eyeball and the gateways out, wondering what's
gonna happen now.

So as long as you are here, show them I.
