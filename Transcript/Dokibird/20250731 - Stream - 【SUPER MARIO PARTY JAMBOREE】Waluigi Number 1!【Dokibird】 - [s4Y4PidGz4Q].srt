1
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,400
Hello, hello everybody.

2
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,620
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:58,700
Um, I will say, um, the reason why we pushed the stream an hour late was because of me.

4
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,560
It was me, all along.

5
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,200
But it was because, um, I couldn't find... I'll tell the full adventure.

6
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,240
I tell... I'll tell the...

7
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,680
Because, like, everybody else was streaming except for me.

8
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,920
So, like, I think everyone could sort of tell it was because I wasn't there.

9
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,200
Because everyone else started their individual streams except for me.

10
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,980
But it was actually because, um, I couldn't find my game capture.

11
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,920
I spent the last four hours trying to find my game capture.

12
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,020
Um, then some of you guys might be wondering, oh, Doki, why didn't you...

13
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,100
Why didn't you try to find it earlier?

14
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,480
Well, it's because I had to take...

15
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,740
If you guys didn't know, um, I won't tell this when everybody...

16
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,040
I was gonna tell...

17
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,440
I'm gonna tell the full story when everyone's here.

18
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,640
I asked if I could and they're just like, yeah.

19
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,940
Um, but I did have to take Dad to the hospital for his CT scans in the morning at 7 in the morning.

20
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,620
So after I took him for his CT scan, I went and took a nap because I was so fucking tired.

21
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,220
Because it's, like, basically, like, we leave him, um, throughout the day.

22
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,380
So, because of that, I went to bed and, like, I went back to take a nap.

23
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,840
And then when I woke up, it was, like, 1, um, it was, like, 1 p.m.

24
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,380
And that's when I started searching for my game capture.

25
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,400
Um, that's what I said.

26
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,700
So, you know, I was like, don't worry.

27
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,680
It'll be fine.

28
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,880
I can find it.

29
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,400
And then, um, and then, you know, as the hours ticked by, I was like, wait a minute.

30
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,400
You know, like, maybe I can't find it.

31
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,540
Yeah.

32
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,700
Yes, it was moved by, I forgot that my cleaner, like, moved it.

33
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,780
So, so, so, yeah.

34
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,820
So, that was sort of a big issue.

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,440
Okay, so apparently, um, oh my gosh.

36
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,420
Wait, okay, I need to do my friends list real quick to make sure I have everybody.

37
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,540
Did they add me yet?

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,140
I don't know.

39
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,920
Wait, let me, I was gonna, I'll tell the full story.

40
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,920
I'll tell the full story on stream, too.

41
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,220
All right, I got Mari.

42
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,320
Okay, Mari added.

43
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,960
All right, I said if I could tell the full story on stream and they said it's okay.

44
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,840
Okay, so I'll tell the full story of how I got my game cap.

45
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,860
Clearly, my game capture to end up working.

46
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,320
Um, I have no idea who Greninja is.

47
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,700
It's someone I bumped into Splatoon a long time ago.

48
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,100
I was like, oh, hey, Greninja.

49
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,080
Who the fuck is that?

50
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,160
Oh my god, I got another friend request right after.

51
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:37,980
Okay.

52
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,740
I got, um...

53
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,220
I got another friend request right after.

54
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,260
I'm pretty sure that is from...

55
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,440
Okay, no, actually, that's not...

56
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,720
Hello?

57
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,700
Hello?

58
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,140
Okay, I am making sure all the foogie's up now.

59
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,580
Let me grab the foogie.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,520
Um...

61
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:02,940
Yeah?

62
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,120
No, don't worry.

63
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,020
My chat knows.

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,860
My chat, I told them.

65
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,480
I was like, we all waited for me.

66
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,300
Everyone was streaming but me.

67
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,840
So, it's deductive reasoning.

68
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,300
We can tell why we pushed this stream.

69
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,020
They're like, oh, wow.

70
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,560
They pushed the stream and now I wonder why.

71
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,640
Wait, Zen's streaming.

72
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,780
Oh, Fillion's streaming.

73
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,760
Oh, MariMari is streaming too.

74
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,440
But where's dookie?

75
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,900
Where is dookie?

76
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,680
No, I'm sorry.

77
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,240
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,280
Um, but yes, thank you for giving me your time so I can tell the full story.

79
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,640
So I can defend myself.

80
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,040
Um...

81
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,880
If we're in court right now, I will defend myself.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,940
As to why the stream was pushed back an hour.

83
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:50,880
Um...

84
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,460
That's fair.

85
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,360
In front of a public audience.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,780
Uh, all right, let me make sure.

87
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,840
Oh, so, hey, Zen.

88
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,480
I heard your thing got an upgrade.

89
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,460
Yes, it did.

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,460
Oh, my God.

91
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,820
It's so fast now.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,220
Whoa.

93
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,840
How's it going?

94
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,340
Look at you go.

95
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,340
Yeah, look at that ping.

96
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,940
What's the ping?

97
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,840
Is it like 10 ping now?

98
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,140
10 MS?

99
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,240
A little bit faster.

100
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,040
Whoa.

101
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,000
So it's like, oh, my God.

102
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,740
You literally live next to the servers now.

103
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,120
So fast.

104
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,580
Yeah, it's so fast.

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:21,920
All right.

106
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,560
Feels good.

107
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,500
Yeah.

108
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,740
Okay, sound guy.

109
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
Help me balance everybody.

110
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,020
Now I can make fun of everybody really fast.

111
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,500
Ooh.

112
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,540
Can you cook me?

113
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,180
Can you cook me?

114
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,440
No.

115
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,160
How?

116
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,860
You're talking about a knot smack for a toaster.

117
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,420
All right.

118
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,760
Hello, Mari.

119
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,720
I am always cooking then.

120
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,740
All right.

121
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,600
Let me...

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,100
All right.

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,800
Hi, Mari.

124
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,120
Now that everyone is here, I shall defend myself as to why I'm...

125
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,720
Why?

126
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,980
You're really inviting us all to cook you publicly for content right now.

127
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,840
You know that, right?

128
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,220
Okay.

129
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,480
If you're setting us up...

130
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,280
Okay, so...

131
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,620
Explain.

132
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,760
Okay, so the reason why...

133
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:02,940
All right.

134
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,720
So...

135
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,380
So I started my...

136
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,360
It was because of me and it was because...

137
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,960
Long story short, it's because I couldn't find my game capture.

138
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:12,840
But...

139
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,720
But there was more.

140
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,660
There's more to this story.

141
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,080
So I started searching for my game capture at 1 p.m.

142
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,180
And I figured, like, oh, it's gonna be easy, you know?

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Like, it's...

144
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,840
Everything is in my...

145
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,060
It's Nintendo Switch.

146
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,760
Everything is in my office.

147
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,700
It should be fine.

148
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:35,340
But the thing is, the thing I forgot was that I have cleaners because I don't have a control of my life.

149
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,820
So I...

150
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,420
So...

151
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,960
It's okay.

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,380
Come in here...

153
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:40,580
We're not adults.

154
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,660
Once a month.

155
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,660
Yeah, so, like, we all understand, right?

156
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,520
Like, as a streamer, we all need extra help.

157
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,600
So...

158
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,640
So I have cleaners that come here...

159
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:58,300
One cleaner that come here once a month to, you know, help me control my life and make sure I don't live like, you know, live like XQC.

160
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,100
Girl, there was no controlling your life.

161
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,520
So, because of that...

162
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:04,700
It is all fucked.

163
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,360
We are all fucked.

164
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,320
They sent in a new...

165
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,080
That's not true.

166
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,740
Not me.

167
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,560
Okay, how's your office, Mari?

168
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,920
Mari, how about you put a girl on?

169
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,800
Yeah, what's...

170
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,860
Why don't you put a girl on?

171
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,940
How's my office?

172
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,340
It's beautiful.

173
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,980
Do you want to see a picture of it?

174
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,140
It's gorgeous and clean and pristine.

175
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,300
Wait, you're going to send a picture?

176
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,820
Wait, do you want to see?

177
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,320
There's no way.

178
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,300
I showed it on...

179
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,220
I literally...

180
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,800
You're searching that.

181
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,780
I showed a stream...

182
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,300
I showed a picture of it on stream the other day.

183
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,320
Wait, you sub-boxed.

184
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,600
Okay, but what did it look like before you cleaned that office?

185
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,140
I...

186
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,280
Okay, well...

187
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,100
I don't need your sass, okay?

188
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,680
Yeah, dude, that's like the one time you spent eight hours cleaning up.

189
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Yeah, like you finally cleaned up your office and then you took a picture of it.

190
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,280
But what was it like before?

191
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,160
I just had to...

192
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,420
I had to take...

193
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,680
What the fuck?

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,360
15 monster energy zero ultra cans off my desk before that.

195
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,320
I'm not going to lie.

196
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,440
Okay, there, there.

197
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
See, point proven.

198
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,860
You can...

199
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,480
Wait, don't show that one.

200
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,980
Oh, yeah, that...

201
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,740
Your Discord's leaking.

202
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,500
Yeah.

203
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,380
Don't show that one.

204
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,140
Okay, but when was this picture taken?

205
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,100
Uh, like...

206
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,880
Like six days ago?

207
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,540
Two weeks ago.

208
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,300
How about take a new picture?

209
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,380
Yeah, how about a new picture?

210
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,620
What does it look like?

211
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,900
Do you want a picture right now?

212
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,520
A new picture right now?

213
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,460
Okay, I'll take a picture right now.

214
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,660
What does it look like?

215
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,880
No makeup.

216
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,880
I will have to say, my desk right now has like seven different bottles of drinks surrounding my desk.

217
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,200
They're all empty.

218
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,920
But you guys can't make fun of me.

219
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,920
They're all empty.

220
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,240
Don't worry, my cleaner's coming in, like, next week, so everything will be okay.

221
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,240
I got too many water bottles.

222
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,360
Oh, yeah?

223
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,840
Well, I cleaned my room.

224
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,980
And on my desk...

225
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,300
I'm a fish.

226
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,100
Saba?

227
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,160
We only have pickled quail eggs and an empty jar of grape jelly from Smucker's.

228
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,500
Wait.

229
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,720
You eat pickled quail eggs?

230
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, I did the one stream and I never took it off.

231
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,160
Awful, by the way, just so you, uh...

232
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,380
It's like eating a pink smell.

233
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,720
Okay, okay, it's...

234
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,460
What's flesh inside of it?

235
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,700
I'm sending it.

236
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,040
It's not even that bad.

237
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,180
Okay.

238
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,140
Cool.

239
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,120
Wait, look.

240
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,280
No, no, no, no, no!

241
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,140
Look, look.

242
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,480
It's just not even that bad.

243
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,380
It's not even that...

244
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,620
Okay, but that's like basically a week.

245
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,840
Wait.

246
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,060
Wait a s...

247
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,340
Wow.

248
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,920
Wait a minute.

249
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,780
You know what, Mari?

250
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,720
I can't even cook you for that.

251
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,120
What the...

252
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,800
Who are you?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,480
That's...

254
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,880
That's what I'm saying.

255
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,020
Wait.

256
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

257
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,980
I can't...

258
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

259
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,220
No, no, no, no, no.

260
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,100
I can't show you.

261
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,300
Do you live...

262
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,640
Do you live with your parents?

263
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,840
No.

264
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,940
Okay, okay.

265
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,600
I was gonna say maybe your parents helped out.

266
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,600
Hey.

267
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,820
What do you take me for?

268
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,900
I don't know.

269
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,120
This doesn't look like a streamer's test.

270
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,200
That's all I'm saying.

271
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,920
I wish my mom would clean my room.

272
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,020
I love my mommy.

273
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,540
And she's very good at cleaning.

274
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,880
She can get blood stains out of anything.

275
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,140
All of our chats are cooked right now, by the way.

276
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,480
How do I get her name?

277
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,860
Listen to your listening.

278
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,060
Okay, okay.

279
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,900
My mom's name?

280
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,380
Wait, what?

281
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,020
Are you trying to dox your mom?

282
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,060
No.

283
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,080
Can you dox your mom's name?

284
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,840
No.

285
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Cashmere just leaks it.

286
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,840
No.

287
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,300
Okay, okay.

288
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,060
Anyway, so back to my story.

289
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,960
Back to my story.

290
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,540
Okay, back to my story.

291
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,560
Back to your story.

292
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,420
Yes, yes.

293
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,960
Anyway, so my cleaner, they assigned me a new cleaner.

294
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,840
And then she was like, wow, it's so messy.

295
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,560
You want me to rearrange everything?

296
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,500
Did your last cleaner die?

297
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,460
No, I don't know.

298
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,280
They never...

299
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,200
She just showed up.

300
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,860
She's like, hello, I'm your new cleaner now.

301
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,580
And I was like, okay.

302
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,160
You got reassigned?

303
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,560
What is the Wizard of Oz cast?

304
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,680
I got reassigned.

305
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Like, it's not that bad.

306
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,840
Okay, it's not that bad.

307
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,580
My place is not that bad for them to quit on me.

308
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,500
But she was like, is it okay?

309
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,400
I'm using that a lot.

310
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,580
It makes me worried.

311
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,160
Yeah, I thought I'm one of us talking.

312
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,980
Look, okay, look.

313
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,580
It's very hard to take care of myself, okay?

314
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,960
And anyway, so...

315
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,080
So I thought it would be okay.

316
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,140
Because, like, you know, it was very messy.

317
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,080
So I was like, it's fine.

318
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,140
You can rearrange everything.

319
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,180
Little did I know, when she rearranged everything, she literally moved everything around.

320
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,160
So I didn't realize how bad it was until, like, today.

321
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,580
Because I couldn't find...

322
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,240
First off, I couldn't find my Switch.

323
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,440
Because it was stuffed in a cupboard that's not even in my office.

324
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,780
And I was like, how the fuck did that get there?

325
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,280
And then I realized none of the cables were connected.

326
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,140
There were no cables next to my Switch.

327
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,460
So I was like, where did she put my cables?

328
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:16,400
Um, so from there, I had to find my GameCapture, all my Switch cables, the cables for my GameCapture as well.

329
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:23,140
And that was, like, four hours of, like, just looking, trying to dig around my house.

330
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,760
The cables was in a fucking box that was located in the corner of my living room.

331
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,320
And filled with clothes, by the way.

332
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,260
There were cables with the clothes box.

333
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,620
And then...

334
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,300
What the fuck does your house sound like?

335
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,780
Like a maze?

336
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:37,940
Yeah.

337
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,740
The fuck?

338
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,120
And honestly, it just sounds like a hoarder's paradise.

339
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,880
Oh, no.

340
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,380
I never unpacked since I moved.

341
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,600
I probably went to the kiddie pool in there.

342
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,300
So, I don't know.

343
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,280
There's, like...

344
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,380
There's, like, um...

345
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,040
Like, 15 boxes in the corner of my living room.

346
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,260
Because I've never unpacked.

347
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,060
Why?

348
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,780
Other than my...

349
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,320
So, when people visit, you look like you're effing out of Breaking Bad.

350
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,560
And if they find your meth lab, you gotta move out.

351
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,720
Like...

352
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,500
Like, the only thing I literally unpacked was, like, software streaming.

353
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,420
Like, literally, my PC and my desk.

354
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,020
Somebody was cooking here.

355
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,400
And, yeah.

356
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,740
So, then, like...

357
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:14,660
I finally found all my cables and my game capture that was stuffed in, like, my clothes box for some reason.

358
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,480
And then I tried connecting everything to my PC.

359
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,420
And for one...

360
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,840
I was doing one hour troubleshooting.

361
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,080
Because I was like, I found it.

362
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,080
I don't have to go out and buy a new game capture.

363
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,920
Thank fucking God.

364
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,600
Because they're expensive.

365
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,460
And then, like, I plugged everything in.

366
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,960
None of it were working.

367
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,300
So, I was like, maybe it needs a Nintendo Switch HDMI cable.

368
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,980
Because I was...

369
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,000
I had, like, a random HDMI cable.

370
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,600
that I found.

371
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,180
And then...

372
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,100
That didn't work.

373
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,760
I was like...

374
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,500
And I had to open...

375
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,300
I was like, okay, I can't find my Nintendo Switch HDMI cable.

376
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,340
Maybe a PlayStation 5 HDMI cable will work.

377
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,280
So, I had to unpack my unopened PS5.

378
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,900
Because I never had to use it.

379
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,200
I grabbed the PS5 HDMI cable.

380
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,280
Wait, you have a PS5 that you've never opened?

381
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,200
I've never opened because there was no games on the PS5.

382
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,220
You don't understand.

383
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,660
What?

384
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,300
There's...

385
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,220
There's...

386
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,360
There's no games on the PS5.

387
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,640
So, there was no reason to unpack it.

388
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,480
You should have sold it, bro.

389
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,420
Like, I'm just hoping there's new games.

390
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:15,780
Okay.

391
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,200
Africa could have eaten that junk.

392
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:17,920
Eventually.

393
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,880
Eventually, there will be new games.

394
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,960
I'm just waiting on that.

395
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,260
So, I unpacked...

396
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,560
No.

397
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,580
The PS5 HDMI cable.

398
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,020
When did the PS5 come out?

399
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,420
I don't know.

400
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,380
It was been like...

401
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,820
I think five plus years.

402
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,240
Five years ago.

403
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,560
Five plus years.

404
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,340
It's not happening, bro.

405
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,780
You just gotta sell it.

406
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,060
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,180
It's too late.

408
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,400
I already opened it.

409
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,660
I kept it.

410
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,460
I'm gonna go back and finish it.

411
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,440
I kept it mid-conditioned for like a year.

412
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,380
And I haven't opened it.

413
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,640
And then I had to open.

414
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,260
I literally ripped the box open because I was so stressed out.

415
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,300
I was so stressed out.

416
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,380
I literally ripped open the box too.

417
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,260
So, the box is not salvageable anymore.

418
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,140
You could have thrown out a homeless person.

419
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,180
But yes.

420
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,620
After that, it still didn't work with my PS5 HDMI cable.

421
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,820
And that's when I was like yelling in our group chat being like, what can I do?

422
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:14,840
And then finally, after four hours and one hour of troubleshooting, I fixed it.

423
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,920
Because all I had to do was unplug the Switch controller charger that was plugged in my Switch.

424
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:23,680
Yes.

425
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,900
And after I unplugged that, my game capture finally worked.

426
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,400
Like, I...

427
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm not gonna ask how.

428
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,080
I don't know how that was interfering with everything.

429
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,720
Like, I just wanted to play on my Switch controller because we're playing Mario Party.

430
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,300
Because, Doki, you tried to use a Switch.

431
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,820
That was your first mistake.

432
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,980
I mean...

433
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,520
This game was your idea!

434
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,860
You suggested the game!

435
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,220
You suggested the game!

436
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,040
Bro!

437
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,560
Zen picked the game!

438
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,160
It's not that hard!

439
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,700
Zen, do you play a lot of the Switch games?

440
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,320
I love Mario.

441
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,640
Here and there.

442
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,080
I would never say that.

443
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,360
Okay.

444
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:06,900
Here and there.

445
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,180
Yeah.

446
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,640
Okay.

447
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,220
See, like...

448
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,380
Like, Doki, like, it's just...

449
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,660
It's a skill issue on our part, okay?

450
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,940
Like, we need to use our Switch more.

451
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,640
Like, if we're not supporting Nintendo, then we're already...

452
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:13,900
Okay, listen.

453
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,560
I'm not trying to get copyrighted by Nintendo.

454
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,720
Oh, true.

455
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Yeah, Chad, today we're playing Mori Party.

456
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,940
Yeah, we're playing Mario Party.

457
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,180
It's not actually, like, Roy at the Nintendo.

458
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,140
I was just talking about the...

459
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,740
How many penis jokes am I allowed to make?

460
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,220
I think it's fine.

461
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:35,660
Today.

462
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,280
Okay, well, I mean, this isn't a joke.

463
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,420
This is a penis fact.

464
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,880
If they're gonna...

465
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,980
I mean, like, so...

466
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,760
Calm down.

467
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,340
She's got a fact.

468
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,840
I've got a penis fact.

469
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,220
I was just talking about how there was...

470
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:54,600
I don't know if it was a company or an individual, but they made a mock-up for a Bowser-themed dildo.

471
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,320
And Nintendo...

472
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,260
I don't know if they sued the living shit out of them, but they got it taken down by Nintendo.

473
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,580
Well, most likely, because, like, Nintendo has a lot of lawyers in general.

474
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,080
Yeah.

475
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,200
100%.

476
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,680
Yeah, I mean, like...

477
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,460
It's because Nintendo wanted the design for themselves.

478
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,560
Did you...

479
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,820
Yeah, after the Pokefreak leaks...

480
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,100
I mean, didn't you see the Donkey Kong shit where you can, like, sculpt anything in the Donkey Kong thing?

481
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,360
And someone literally made a Donkey Dong and got DMCA'd by Nintendo.

482
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,680
Wait, they got DMCA'd inside of their own game?

483
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,260
No, they...

484
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,300
Yeah, they got banned off of the Nintendo Switch 2.

485
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,320
So they got banned off of the, like, online features on Nintendo Switch 2.

486
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,840
After he tweeted the picture out.

487
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,080
He didn't even upload it or anything.

488
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,300
He just tweeted the picture out and his account got banned.

489
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,700
Uh-oh.

490
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,820
Because he made the Donkey Dong.

491
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,360
We'll get a phone call from Nintendo.

492
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,880
I don't know who you are.

493
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,900
And I think it DMCA'd the picture, too.

494
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,980
Yeah, the Nintendong.

495
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,680
No Nintendongs allowed.

496
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,320
That's why Donkey Kong's not naked anymore.

497
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,060
Wait, what?

498
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,840
She's not naked?

499
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,040
His default outfit has tags on.

500
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,200
Did you ever see the original animated one?

501
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,080
Oh, the Donkey Kong Country animated series?

502
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,120
Yeah.

503
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,920
Yeah, I love that series.

504
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
With all the songs.

505
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,740
I'll shower you in coconut cream pies.

506
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,800
But it's so good.

507
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,160
Yeah.

508
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,640
Also, who is making...

509
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,120
It is really good.

510
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,160
Who's making the lobby for this game?

511
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,580
Oh, I don't think any of us know what we're doing.

512
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,180
I think Zen is, like, our parent today.

513
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,760
Oh, yeah, Zen.

514
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,640
You have to add me, by the way, Zen.

515
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,380
Oh, you are...

516
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,260
Everybody add Doki, and then we enter her lobby.

517
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,680
Oh, that's true.

518
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,600
Because I already added her.

519
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,940
Yeah.

520
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,420
Okay.

521
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,620
Add me.

522
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,160
I'm waiting.

523
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,060
I'm going to try to make sure my junk is working real quick.

524
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,720
I mean, because obviously it is, but yeah.

525
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,280
You know, one sec.

526
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,900
It's working.

527
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,340
Did you not fucking test me?

528
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,540
Your lovely lady junk?

529
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,080
When I get my hands on you.

530
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,280
Science team?

531
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,820
Oh, yeah?

532
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,860
Come and put your hands on me, huh?

533
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
I'll push you over.

534
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,520
Can I close my eyes before you guys do anything crazy?

535
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,500
No.

536
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,000
You have to witness this.

537
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:09,880
Okay.

538
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,820
You have to witness my glorious victory.

539
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,480
Okay.

540
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,140
Okay.

541
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,140
Oh, it's working.

542
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,780
It is working.

543
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,020
So who are we stealing the star from?

544
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,360
Zen?

545
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,000
What?

546
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,680
Not it.

547
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,600
Not it.

548
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,860
I call Zen.

549
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,260
Oh.

550
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,520
But actually, no.

551
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,800
We should just steal Fillion's.

552
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,500
He's the one that has the least experience in Nintendo.

553
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,320
I like your idea.

554
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,180
Let's do it.

555
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,720
What is this?

556
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,180
An effing Kendrick versus Drake?

557
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,260
Brother, like...

558
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,500
Wait, which one are you?

559
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,440
Fillion, I've never...

560
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,080
Which one are you?

561
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,460
Choose your sides carefully.

562
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,020
Fillion, I don't think I've ever seen you play a video game ever.

563
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,180
So I feel like you're kind of the weak link here.

564
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,020
Doug, I beat you on chess.

565
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,460
It's true.

566
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:54,880
Wait, what were you...

567
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,700
Yeah, Fillion, what were you doing before this?

568
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,520
We never played chess, bro.

569
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,900
Because I beat you.

570
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,380
What are you saying, Dougie?

571
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,660
What were you doing before this?

572
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:01,940
Ow.

573
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,360
Fillion?

574
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,440
Oh, I was...

575
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,300
Were you watching videos?

576
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,960
Fillion beats me.

577
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,280
I was reacting.

578
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,360
I was reacting.

579
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,380
I was reacting.

580
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,360
I was playing was Waldo IRL.

581
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,680
So, yeah.

582
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,100
That's just reacting.

583
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,320
Okay.

584
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh, yeah?

585
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,880
Did you tell me what the flag of Tunisia looks like?

586
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,820
Why would I need to know what the flag of Tunisia looks like?

587
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:31,080
Because what if you got Fortnite dropped out of the battle bus in a random location blindfolded and you had no idea where you were?

588
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,040
Well, to do that, I have to go outside first.

589
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:34,740
Okay.

590
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,420
Yeah, whatever.

591
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:35,820
Fine.

592
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:36,960
Okay.

593
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:37,840
It's fine.

594
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:38,980
Okay.

595
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,240
How do you invite...

596
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,640
Just invite me.

597
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,080
Just invite me.

598
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,620
Mom, please come on, boy.

599
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,240
I'm waiting for Zen to add me.

600
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,080
What did I do?

601
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,880
Zen added me.

602
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,240
Don't...

603
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,860
Don't be against me, please.

604
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,480
I need a teammate.

605
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,240
But you beat me.

606
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,860
I have sent.

607
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,160
You just said you beat me.

608
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,500
You just admitted to everybody that you beat me.

609
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,640
Yeah, you were pretty nice and moderating me.

610
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,780
Are you gonna beat me if I'm not on your side again?

611
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,060
No, no.

612
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,820
If we team up, then we can beat them.

613
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,220
Will you not beat me if I'm on your side?

614
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,400
Why are you making this freaky, bro?

615
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
I'm not a Discord moderator.

616
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,620
I am booting up my Switch game.

617
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay.

618
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,480
Okay, okay, okay.

619
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:13,960
How do I...

620
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,380
Do I have time to go pee?

621
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,260
Yeah, you do.

622
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,420
Because I still have to...

623
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,980
Move for it.

624
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,020
I have to wait for Zen to invite me.

625
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,040
Alright, Zen.

626
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,980
I'm connecting to the internet.

627
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,860
I'm connecting to the internet.

628
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,380
I'm connecting it.

629
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:28,900
Waluigi.

630
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,620
I'm connecting it.

631
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,540
I did some Waluigi.

632
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,200
I'm connecting it.

633
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,640
Okay.

634
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,860
I got Shy Guy.

635
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,620
Alright.

636
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,660
Wait, can I be Boo?

637
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,840
I don't think anyone else is playing Boo.

638
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:43,900
Yeah!

639
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,540
I love Boo.

640
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,100
Boo for it.

641
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,260
Thank you.

642
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,550
Alright.

643
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,650
I'm trying to remember how to do this.

644
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,590
It's been so long.

645
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,530
Same aft.

646
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,430
Same aft.

647
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,490
Alright.

648
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,310
At chat.

649
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,510
How do I join someone...

650
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,230
Oh, join the party.

651
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,570
Is that the blue?

652
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,390
Did you say at chat?

653
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,230
Yeah, at chat.

654
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,350
They're my at grok.

655
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,010
Okay.

656
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,790
Wait.

657
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,570
Oh, I'm talking to you to create the room.

658
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,790
Yeah, you have to create the room.

659
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,130
Zen, you're our parent.

660
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:15,630
Please help.

661
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,590
Oh, shit.

662
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,190
Yeah, I wait.

663
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,730
Gotta go get the milk.

664
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:20,370
Sorry.

665
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,370
No!

666
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,810
We have to play Tic Tac Tover for hours.

667
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,010
Mom?

668
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,770
Really bad at that game.

669
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,150
Um, actually.

670
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,970
Just put the circle in the center.

671
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:34,350
Okay.

672
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,590
That's all you have to do.

673
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:35,830
Room's open.

674
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,750
Okay.

675
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:37,750
Let me...

676
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,170
The room's open?

677
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,950
I thought it was the left bottom corner.

678
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,210
Hey, joining room.

679
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,910
Yeah, I do the corners too.

680
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,190
I found it.

681
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,830
I caught a lot of them.

682
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,530
I think I'm joining.

683
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,510
Alright, you guys can join off of me now.

684
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:49,910
Hi.

685
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,130
So, what's the room?

686
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,410
Um, you just do like...

687
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:52,810
Wait, did I zen make the room?

688
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,950
Just do join room and then you'll find the room.

689
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,670
Oh, I'm gonna hide in the street.

690
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,670
There's the...

691
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,070
Well, there's no code on it.

692
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,850
It's literally just joining off of your friends.

693
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:02,190
Yeah.

694
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,490
I know, but I need to leak all...

695
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,650
I don't want to leak all my friends.

696
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,250
There's like a lot of them, so...

697
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,410
And all of them are playing Mario Party?

698
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,610
We're not friends.

699
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,070
We're not even friends yet.

700
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,450
Okay.

701
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:12,910
No, we are.

702
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,570
I added you.

703
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,690
Yeah, but I gotta...

704
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,270
I don't know what to accept the friend request.

705
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,790
Oh, you go to home and then click on your profile picture.

706
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,110
And then you should be able to...

707
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,750
Oh, friends are just...

708
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,450
Oh, add friends.

709
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,110
Oh, I have two friends request.

710
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:27,650
Hello.

711
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,490
Doki, yeah.

712
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,970
All right, welcome back, Mario.

713
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,250
Just join off of...

714
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,070
Join off the room.

715
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,910
Wait, you all blind here?

716
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,050
Yeah.

717
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:38,830
Fillion.

718
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,010
What?

719
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,390
I have two friends now.

720
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,490
I went from zero friends online to two.

721
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,930
This is the best day of my life.

722
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,530
Wait, you...

723
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,770
When was the last time you played on...

724
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,230
on the Switch?

725
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,630
This is a big day.

726
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,150
I'm...

727
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,510
Wait, have you never played Mario Party?

728
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,230
I'm on the team?

729
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:57,990
I'm...

730
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,290
Uh...

731
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,330
Have you never played Mario Party, Fillion?

732
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,710
Like, how do you have zero friends?

733
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,410
I'm telling you, Fillion's never played a video...

734
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,190
Wait, Mario, are you not even her friend?

735
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,310
Are you just an associate?

736
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,530
I'm not her friend on Switch.

737
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,290
No, we've...

738
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,830
We've literally never played a game together.

739
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,550
Fillion just brings me on and forces me to do bits with her.

740
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,030
And you added in such a bad life.

741
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,550
No, I love it.

742
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,210
I love you.

743
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,870
Thank you.

744
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,730
Thank you.

745
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,730
You don't need a table to say that?

746
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,890
The absolute shit of her now.

747
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,930
Yippee!

748
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,810
I'm a ghost.

749
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,370
Wait, are we playing?

750
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,010
Yeah, we're playing.

751
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,730
Kestars.

752
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,150
Holy frick.

753
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,250
Mods, quit this, bro.

754
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,990
All right, Zen, we're selecting everything.

755
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,050
Mods, quit this.

756
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,310
By the way, I'm playing...

757
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,270
Fillion's great adventure.

758
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,450
I'm playing off of my OBS screen.

759
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,610
Do you guys want the worst map or the best map?

760
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,170
Mods, twist her balls off.

761
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,390
Oh, this map fucking...

762
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,250
No, no, please.

763
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,230
That map sucks.

764
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,770
The best map of the worst map?

765
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,330
We should do Wiggler's Woods.

766
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,030
Wiggler!

767
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,870
Wait, we have Fillion, so we should play, like, the easiest map.

768
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,370
You're a clanker.

769
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,270
What are you saying?

770
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,770
You can't...

771
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,430
You real...

772
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,970
Did you just say that to Zen?

773
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,570
No, I said to Toki, so it's fine.

774
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,530
That doesn't make it...

775
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,390
In front of Zen?

776
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,970
Wait, Zen, do you...

777
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:19,970
Do you give her the pass?

778
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,050
I am telling your mom.

779
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,830
Oh, she didn't give you the pass, Fillion, so you're not allowed to say that.

780
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,270
Yeah, that's really fucked up.

781
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,890
Yeah, she didn't give you the pass.

782
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,170
What do you prefer to be called?

783
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:34,890
Just Zen.

784
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,750
Okay, whatever.

785
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,170
Just Zen.

786
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,470
Alright, Zen.

787
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,010
Which one are we there?

788
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,650
Zen, do I have the pass?

789
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,150
Do you guys want the worst map or the best map?

790
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,130
I want a media map.

791
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,790
The worst one.

792
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:50,890
The best one.

793
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,210
The worst one.

794
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,150
Do the Bowser one, not the Bowser one.

795
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,990
This is the worst one?

796
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,910
No, Western Land is awesome.

797
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,910
Did you watch Star Wars?

798
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,570
Wait, which one?

799
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,010
There's so many Star Wars.

800
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,030
I've played Lego Star Wars.

801
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,350
Hi.

802
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,410
Okay.

803
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,910
Then you got it.

804
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,270
Yippee.

805
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,650
Yippee.

806
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,370
Can I get one handicap star?

807
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,130
Wait, can I get one too?

808
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,290
No.

809
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,450
Wait, you guys need handicaps?

810
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,190
I'm toad.

811
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,770
Can I throw a negative one star?

812
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,930
I'm toad number one.

813
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:27,810
Worst map.

814
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,190
Here we go.

815
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,290
How's this the worst map?

816
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,230
Wait, wait, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

817
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,190
Sorry, in advance.

818
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,750
How long does the game take a Mario Party?

819
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,290
Like, two hours?

820
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,950
No, it's like...

821
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,370
It's kind of short now.

822
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,190
An hour and a half?

823
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:40,430
Oh.

824
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,150
Yeah, like an hour and a half.

825
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,070
An hour and a half?

826
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,170
Yeah.

827
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,790
I mean, it depends on who logged in.

828
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,210
Depends on how many stars we have to get.

829
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,270
Like, you don't want to be stuck with us for an hour and a half because you freaking hate us.

830
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,950
No, we should play six games.

831
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:54,430
Oh, no.

832
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,610
That's going to take literally eight hours, Millian.

833
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,270
Do you not like us?

834
00:27:59,450 --> 00:27:59,990
Do you not like us?

835
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:00,830
Six hours.

836
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,610
You know what?

837
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,950
You know, I just thought it was weird that you were just doing six games and not ten games.

838
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,590
Guys, impromptu subathon.

839
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,550
Make sure to donate.

840
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,430
We'll all keep streaming.

841
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,930
Wait, who I do?

842
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,370
Two.

843
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,770
Ah, you should have given me the handicap bonus.

844
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,250
What do I do?

845
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,690
Yay.

846
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,270
Press A.

847
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:20,470
What?

848
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,490
What the fuck?

849
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:22,930
Yeah.

850
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:23,430
Oh!

851
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,530
Okay.

852
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,510
Well.

853
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:28,470
Whatever.

854
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,010
I don't even care.

855
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,050
I don't car.

856
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,750
Guys, I'm blind and I'm first.

857
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,250
Good for you.

858
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,730
That will change very fast.

859
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,510
Mari, you're on my team, okay?

860
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,090
Watch me lead us with example.

861
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,350
Oh, okay.

862
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:46,670
Here we go.

863
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,810
I didn't realize we were doing teams.

864
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,170
That's me.

865
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,490
That's me.

866
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,270
Millian, you're not going to backstab me, right?

867
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,410
Oh, she will.

868
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,590
What am I, Kesha?

869
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,610
No, of course not.

870
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,690
Let me just...

871
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,190
Here?

872
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:00,730
Kesha?

873
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,110
How old are you, bro?

874
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,330
What do you mean, Kesha?

875
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,350
There's a song called Backstabber.

876
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,550
Okay, fine.

877
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,070
I'm going to say some other stuff that Zen won't approve of.

878
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,090
So, it's either that or be a boomer.

879
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,890
Yeah, I'm sure.

880
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,450
Okay, I'm first.

881
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:14,730
Here we go.

882
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,230
Okay, lock in.

883
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,530
Here we go.

884
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,270
So, what do I do?

885
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:16,910
I got my controller.

886
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,630
I can look around.

887
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,190
Dice block.

888
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,510
Do I just...

889
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,610
Here?

890
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,130
Yeah.

891
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:21,630
Now what?

892
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:21,930
Yeah.

893
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,270
Yeah.

894
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,390
Just hit it.

895
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,490
Wait, have you...

896
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:25,650
What?

897
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:27,770
Oh!

898
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:27,790
Oh!

899
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:27,830
Oh!

900
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,950
Oh!

901
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:28,490
Oh!

902
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,350
She got a luck box, though.

903
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:30,970
What is this?

904
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,730
It's a luck box.

905
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,110
Blah!

906
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,410
Give me some money.

907
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,290
Yeah, you get...

908
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,990
Oh, you get an item.

909
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,690
Oh, you get to steal...

910
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:39,930
Wow.

911
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:40,310
Yeah.

912
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,870
You got the worthless one.

913
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:42,650
Congrats.

914
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,230
Now that's true.

915
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:47,050
To be fair, I feel like she won't even know how to put it down.

916
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,730
So, I think that's fine for us.

917
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,710
Wait, when do I put it down?

918
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,270
Nobody tell her.

919
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,870
Nobody tell her how to put it down.

920
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:53,610
Goodbye.

921
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,210
Let's see.

922
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,610
Let's view the board.

923
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,190
Wait, how many do I have left?

924
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,930
Do you guys like going outside?

925
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,850
Oh, actually...

926
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,230
Yes.

927
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,630
I do.

928
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:07,850
Good.

929
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,130
Yeah.

930
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,610
I like, uh...

931
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,410
Oh, my God.

932
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,830
Are you the fuck out of the map?

933
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,090
I like running really fast.

934
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,530
How fast can you run?

935
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,190
Uh, faster than you.

936
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,330
Okay, well, I'm faster than speed, so...

937
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,550
Well, I'm faster than that.

938
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,330
Get out of the fucking map!

939
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,310
I'm faster than Ashen Hall.

940
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,370
I don't even know who that is.

941
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:27,630
What are you doing?

942
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,450
I'm trying to get out of the map and won't let me!

943
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,230
Oh, my God!

944
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,510
And you guys are blaming me!

945
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,250
I made my turn in 10 seconds!

946
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,070
Doki Bird, more like Doki Boomer.

947
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,210
Oh, my God.

948
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:42,730
Come on, Ant.

949
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,430
What's happening?

950
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,070
I mean, the controls do kinda suck sometimes on this coin.

951
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,790
Okay, there we go.

952
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,830
You're an apologist!

953
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,190
You're an apologist!

954
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:50,670
Finally!

955
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:52,350
Finally!

956
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:52,370
Fuck!

957
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,430
I was like, let me go!

958
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,150
Ha ha!

959
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,510
Who want to?

960
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,630
Get to the next station?

961
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,490
I don't wanna, man!

962
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,250
Is that the midnight train?

963
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,570
I don't wanna.

964
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:00,910
I don't wanna.

965
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,410
Can now say the fuck word at...

966
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:04,890
...Youtube.

967
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,150
Nope.

968
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,130
Did you hear?

969
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,450
What happened to YouTube?

970
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,850
Yeah, what happened?

971
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,430
Is the bird the word?

972
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,670
Apparently, you can say the word fuck now at the beginning of your seven seconds.

973
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:19,990
Wait, really?

974
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,110
Oh, yeah.

975
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,930
They changed that.

976
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,910
Chat, I'm gonna say it.

977
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,850
Seven three.

978
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,750
You weren't allowed to say fuck in the first seven seconds?

979
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,030
Yeah, you get demonetized if you do.

980
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:33,630
Oh.

981
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,370
I guess I never tried.

982
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,990
It's the same with, like, YouTube videos, too.

983
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,930
That's why, like, in the first...

984
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:46,930
I think, like, for YouTube videos, like, in the first seven seconds, they just, like, let an intro play so people don't have to worry about it.

985
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,290
Oh.

986
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,210
Somebody told me it was a good day for Australians then.

987
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,250
Not sure what that meant.

988
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,190
Because Australians curse a lot, probably.

989
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,310
Yeah.

990
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,970
Yeah, they have two words.

991
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,830
One starts with an F and one starts with a C.

992
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:06,730
Oh.

993
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:07,530
Cunt.

994
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,450
Cuck.

995
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,550
She got it.

996
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,030
Oh.

997
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,360
I'm allowed to say it.

998
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,440
I used to be the Prime Minister of Australia.

999
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:17,960
Minigame.

1000
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,320
Wait, what?

1001
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,060
Minigame.

1002
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,800
Uh-huh.

1003
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,420
What is this?

1004
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,160
Wait, how did you get overthrown?

1005
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,040
No.

1006
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,760
What?

1007
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,640
Hot, hot, hot.

1008
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,140
What is this?

1009
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:31,920
What's happening?

1010
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,360
What's happening?

1011
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,100
What's happening?

1012
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,400
I think this is the one where you don't fall in lava.

1013
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,080
It's game time.

1014
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,380
It's been nine months since I played Mario Party.

1015
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,860
Mario Party.

1016
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,180
You gotta jump.

1017
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,520
You just jumped over it.

1018
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,080
Oh, you just jumped.

1019
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,820
No, it's okay.

1020
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,500
I just died.

1021
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm ready.

1022
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,480
Yeah.

1023
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,760
No worries.

1024
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,520
I've been training my whole life for a bit.

1025
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,840
Oh, I should have just practiced.

1026
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,040
Maybe I shouldn't play off of my OBS screen.

1027
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,340
No worries.

1028
00:32:53,620 --> 00:33:09,340
I've been training my whole life for a bit.

1029
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:09,960
Okay, so I jumped.

1030
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,020
Yeah, isn't it cute?

1031
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,380
You should go pet it, billion.

1032
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,260
Wait, oh, I got it.

1033
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,580
Uh-oh.

1034
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,140
Yeah, it's a good thing.

1035
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,640
Look at me!

1036
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:17,980
Whoa.

1037
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,060
Okay.

1038
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,620
Whoa, there's so many.

1039
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,600
Just watch out for the giant flaming hippos.

1040
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,720
They look pretty hungry.

1041
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,340
Whatever the fuck those things are.

1042
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,040
I think they're snakes.

1043
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,360
I can't see my character.

1044
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:31,580
Help.

1045
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,060
Yippee.

1046
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,100
Wait, what happens if we all live?

1047
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,440
Um, then we all get first place.

1048
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,200
Then it ties.

1049
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,220
Then we all get coins.

1050
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,840
Guys, guys.

1051
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,060
We can win together.

1052
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:41,420
Yeah.

1053
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,420
Why are you stepping on me?

1054
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,120
Vance.

1055
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,380
Why did half of the human population get wiped out?

1056
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:48,900
I took you down with me.

1057
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,000
Just run straight into it.

1058
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:51,840
Okay.

1059
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,660
I won.

1060
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,200
Fuck.

1061
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,080
I died?

1062
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,560
I'm the blue.

1063
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:58,880
Aww.

1064
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,700
It's okay.

1065
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:01,820
It's okay.

1066
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,260
Zen and I...

1067
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,700
I took Zen down with me accidentally.

1068
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,420
Did you grab her?

1069
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,140
I stomped on her front.

1070
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,340
I ran straight into it with my stupid...

1071
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,620
God fucking...

1072
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,400
Turned two out of ten.

1073
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:19,760
Who turns?

1074
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,060
Hey!

1075
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,340
Wario!

1076
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,500
It's a plumber.

1077
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,700
I don't think Wario is a plumber.

1078
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,700
Are they all plumber?

1079
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,860
He's a...

1080
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,960
He also has the biggest ass in the game.

1081
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,680
Yeah.

1082
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,220
It's true.

1083
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,280
Oh my god.

1084
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,720
Have you seen his behind in the new Mario Kart?

1085
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,300
It's exquisite.

1086
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,540
What?

1087
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,600
Are you guys straight or something?

1088
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,240
Don't know how they keep doing it.

1089
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,600
But they keep doing it.

1090
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,200
They really just keep making it bigger.

1091
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,600
They polished it up.

1092
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,380
Damn.

1093
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,820
He really do be farting with that thing.

1094
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,440
Oh, this is me.

1095
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,280
This is me.

1096
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,940
Okay.

1097
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,220
Okay.

1098
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,060
So, I have items.

1099
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:55,320
Yes?

1100
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,140
Okay.

1101
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:56,880
Now what?

1102
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,760
Are you guys all ahead of me?

1103
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,680
You probably are.

1104
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,760
No, we're fine.

1105
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,340
Do not see Toad right behind you?

1106
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,880
No, no, no.

1107
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,480
No, no, no.

1108
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm gonna save my trap for when the time is right.

1109
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:08,680
Wait.

1110
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,520
And I'm gonna jump.

1111
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:11,940
Okay.

1112
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,860
Make them away downtown.

1113
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,020
Walking fast.

1114
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,760
Faces fast.

1115
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,340
Faces fast.

1116
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,560
Faces fast.

1117
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:19,640
Faces fast.

1118
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,600
You should go up because...

1119
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,260
Why?

1120
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,500
Because it's closer to the star.

1121
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,380
Why?

1122
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,420
Because it's closer to the star.

1123
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,600
I...

1124
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,120
What does the red square do?

1125
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,440
Uh...

1126
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,720
You should find out.

1127
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,280
I don't know.

1128
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:31,900
It's really nice.

1129
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,620
I think it's...

1130
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,480
It's a trap.

1131
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,720
I think it swaps you with someone else if you land on it.

1132
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,520
No!

1133
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,000
I think it swaps you with someone else if you land on it.

1134
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,780
Yeah.

1135
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,220
Do it.

1136
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,940
Do it.

1137
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,640
Wow, you guys really are Retubers, huh?

1138
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,640
What is this gaslight?

1139
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,600
Get on the red.

1140
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,440
Thank you, Palpatine.

1141
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,600
Do it now.

1142
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:49,540
No!

1143
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,560
Five soft.

1144
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,760
I think that extra star.

1145
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,720
I don't know.

1146
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,880
I'm not going to always pick that.

1147
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,300
Fillion, you need to take one for the team.

1148
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,160
Awwww.

1149
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,080
How are we going to ever know it?

1150
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,480
How are you gonna get your star then?

1151
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,240
I...

1152
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,600
Why are you gonna get your star?

1153
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,180
But...

1154
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,060
Oh, but why did you ask then?

1155
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,580
Why does it ask what it does?

1156
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,560
I can roll whatever number I want?

1157
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,820
What the frick?

1158
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,440
What's the point of asking your opinion?

1159
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,140
You're not gonna take our suggestions.

1160
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,180
Yeah.

1161
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,640
You're right.

1162
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,260
I'm sorry.

1163
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,300
You don't trust us?

1164
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,640
I thought we were all friends.

1165
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,000
Well... I don't have enough coins.

1166
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,340
No, I don't have enough coins.

1167
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,100
How many coins do you need?

1168
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,240
20?

1169
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,140
Like 50.

1170
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,460
Uh-oh.

1171
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,640
You got spotlighted.

1172
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,780
20 coins.

1173
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,500
I ain't gonna get hit by a train!

1174
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,480
You wanted the Danganronpa?

1175
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,080
No, she could buy...

1176
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah, she just shifted it.

1177
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:54,100
You know, it's impressive, though, that in, like, the almost 30 years of Mario Party being around, stars have never gotten any more expensive.

1178
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,560
I know, there's no inflation.

1179
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,280
They're following the Costco hotdog.

1180
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,160
Yeah, I know.

1181
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,100
Amazing.

1182
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:00,760
That's great.

1183
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,440
Can I get rid of it?

1184
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,520
I've never had a Costco hotdog.

1185
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,220
Is it good?

1186
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:04,520
What?

1187
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,860
It's delicious.

1188
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,180
It's so good for, like, the price it is.

1189
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,060
Yeah.

1190
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,160
How much?

1191
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,520
$1.50 for a dog and a drink combo.

1192
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,260
Brokey.

1193
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,840
Dude, this is fucking bullshit.

1194
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,480
Brokey.

1195
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,380
I went to the movie theaters the other day, and the hotdogs were, like, $5.

1196
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,100
That's what I'm saying.

1197
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,640
You've got to get to Costco.

1198
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,040
Dude, fuck me.

1199
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,420
Oh, my God.

1200
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,620
Five American dollar dollars?

1201
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:28,720
That's what I'm saying.

1202
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,460
Wait, you can't wait.

1203
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:29,940
I...

1204
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,220
I need to be so for real with you.

1205
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,600
I've gone to Costco before the movie.

1206
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,220
And stuffing the hotdogs in my bag.

1207
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:36,420
Just...

1208
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,100
I've done...

1209
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,340
Yes.

1210
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,820
Do it.

1211
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,260
Do it.

1212
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,640
Do it.

1213
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,780
I've done the same exact thing.

1214
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
It's worth it.

1215
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,920
$1.50?

1216
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,880
Oh, but you need a Costco membership.

1217
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,260
When you pull out the hotdogs, they're all crinkled and squished.

1218
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,380
It's okay.

1219
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,740
It tastes better that way.

1220
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,120
Just put in...

1221
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,780
No, put in, like, those, like, little boxes.

1222
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,260
Exactly.

1223
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,060
Those little containers.

1224
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,000
Container.

1225
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,020
Oh, good idea.

1226
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,660
I didn't sneak it in.

1227
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,220
What are they gonna do?

1228
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:02,820
Check your bag?

1229
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,300
Are they supposed to put up your hotdogs for hotdogs?

1230
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,960
It's a free country.

1231
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,380
I like my dog squished.

1232
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,620
Uh...

1233
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:12,860
I'm going.

1234
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,140
Come on.

1235
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,780
Um...

1236
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,440
Mahari?

1237
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:16,920
Ten.

1238
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,620
Mahari?

1239
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,200
Wait.

1240
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,800
But do you guys like eating your hotdogs plain?

1241
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,280
No, I like a hotdog with my ketchup, typically.

1242
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,340
Mustard, ketchup, onions...

1243
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,940
I have to eat my hotdogs plain.

1244
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:32,600
Why?

1245
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,240
Really?

1246
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:33,580
I'm sorry.

1247
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,260
Why do you like your dogs being naked?

1248
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,220
Yeah.

1249
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:36,940
Plain.

1250
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:37,980
Why play?

1251
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,800
Wait, why do you eat food?

1252
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,700
But it's so juicy.

1253
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,660
Ooh.

1254
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,900
Is that even with onions?

1255
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,360
Do I eat food so I can fucking move?

1256
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:48,600
What is this game?

1257
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,220
I thought you were a toaster!

1258
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,520
Double the coins!

1259
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,780
Flynn, you're being awfully...

1260
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,120
You still gotta put stuff in toasters.

1261
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,460
How about you stop at a Tesla station?

1262
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,660
And charge?

1263
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,840
I mean, technically.

1264
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,980
What is this?

1265
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,660
What is this?

1266
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,120
Wait, are we dead?

1267
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,740
Guys, don't leave me!

1268
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,020
I'm really scared!

1269
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,900
Just grab as many coins as you can.

1270
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,940
Check this out.

1271
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,240
Which means I'm taking all of your coins.

1272
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,460
Get out of my...

1273
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,240
I died so I could play the actual game.

1274
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,500
It's okay.

1275
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,280
Just like the simulations.

1276
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,600
Start!

1277
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,720
Start, though!

1278
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,400
Alright.

1279
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,040
Glass, I'm taking the early lead.

1280
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,340
Stop!

1281
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,260
Stop!

1282
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,760
Ah!

1283
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,200
Oh, you fell off.

1284
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,100
Stop fighting.

1285
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,400
Stop fighting!

1286
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,140
What do you mean stop fighting?

1287
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,340
Oh, I fucking fell.

1288
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,880
Okay, I'm bringing my monitor up.

1289
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,200
I can't play on real piss.

1290
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,620
I got a coin!

1291
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:48,960
I got the coin!

1292
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,900
Who the frick is Shy Guy?

1293
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,980
Oh, she's good.

1294
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,920
Who is Shy Guy?

1295
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,600
Wait, who died?

1296
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,140
I just fucking disappeared.

1297
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,000
I realized that that was a mistake.

1298
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,080
We are whine.

1299
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:57,480
It's okay.

1300
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,040
I'm the hard carry.

1301
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,060
Don't worry, kittens.

1302
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,600
Boom!

1303
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,360
Shot through Stacey.

1304
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,060
Boom!

1305
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,320
And you guys slaved me!

1306
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,580
Wow.

1307
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,760
I am a beginner.

1308
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,800
I thought you said you didn't play.

1309
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,140
Beginner's luck.

1310
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,240
I'm putting the monitor up now.

1311
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,900
I'm playing on my lap.

1312
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,520
Cause I don't have space on my desk.

1313
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,260
Get a new gamer chair.

1314
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,280
Mine's way better.

1315
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,740
Huh?

1316
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,180
Wait, I can buy a star now?

1317
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,460
No, only if you get to it.

1318
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,880
Whoever gets there first.

1319
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm gonna get to it.

1320
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,560
I'm gonna touch it.

1321
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,940
Wait a second.

1322
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,240
I can just do...

1323
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,920
Wait, how do I...

1324
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,160
Board?

1325
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm bored?

1326
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,200
Okay, so...

1327
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,280
One, two, three...

1328
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,060
Custom dice.

1329
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,340
Don't say that!

1330
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,860
And then roll a one.

1331
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,960
My monitor's on my lap, guys.

1332
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,860
The number one's gonna be big.

1333
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,140
Do I...

1334
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,860
Do I wanna...

1335
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,160
Wait, do I have to roll an eight?

1336
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,620
You have to roll a six.

1337
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,580
I'm gonna roll an eight, everybody.

1338
00:40:59,760 --> 00:40:59,920
Watch this.

1339
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,020
You wanna roll a one.

1340
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,980
I'm going to roll an eight now.

1341
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,460
I promise.

1342
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,240
Stop.

1343
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,420
Okay, how does this work?

1344
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,160
The more...

1345
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,360
But the thing is, the more stars she has, the more likely she'll get her stars stolen.

1346
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,140
Don't.

1347
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,300
Don't.

1348
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,280
Don't.

1349
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,520
Don't.

1350
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:18,720
Hi.

1351
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:18,920
Hi.

1352
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,280
What's up, guys?

1353
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,740
I hate to break it to you, but...

1354
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,960
Like, I'm a little bit rich.

1355
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,420
Let me just flex with, um...

1356
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,460
Ooh, okay.

1357
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,140
Yeah, mushroom tickets.

1358
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,400
Yeah.

1359
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,080
That looks good.

1360
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,240
Um, chain chomp.

1361
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,540
Move a star?

1362
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,180
Please, up the toothpaste.

1363
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,160
I don't give a frick.

1364
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,880
I'm gonna...

1365
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,500
Buy nothing.

1366
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:34,840
I'm broke.

1367
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:35,780
Okay.

1368
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,800
A boo!

1369
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,740
Wait, so...

1370
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,260
How the fuck do you have 50 coins?

1371
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:41,980
La boo boo.

1372
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,520
What the fuck?

1373
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,620
Cause I have a 24 karat golden la boo boo and you don't...

1374
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,720
Is anyone actually own a la boo boo here?

1375
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,520
There's only one and you don't own it.

1376
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,720
If you're a broke boy, just say so.

1377
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,580
I thought about getting one.

1378
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,000
A la boo boo.

1379
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,920
A la boo boo.

1380
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,020
You should get a la boo boo.

1381
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,720
I thought about getting a la boo boo too.

1382
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,160
Then I remember, I hated it.

1383
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,660
They're ugly.

1384
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,060
What do you mean?

1385
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,760
They're ugly.

1386
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,540
That's really rude of you.

1387
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,660
They're ugly.

1388
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,260
Fillian, you're rude.

1389
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,360
Would you hate your child if they're ugly?

1390
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,100
Yeah.

1391
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,620
I literally went to a gas station.

1392
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:13,880
Okay.

1393
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,740
And they have them as well.

1394
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,000
Isn't that how orphans came to be?

1395
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,780
What, cause they're ugly?

1396
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,200
Wait, so if you find out someone's an orphan on the internet, you can just call them ugly.

1397
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:23,980
Damn.

1398
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,380
Okay, that's not what I meant.

1399
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,720
It's a freak crit.

1400
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,640
That's not very nice.

1401
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,460
This is war.

1402
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,440
This is minigame.

1403
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,320
Ooh.

1404
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,280
Well.

1405
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,660
No, don't take me.

1406
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,620
This is one burn time.

1407
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,460
Noo.

1408
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,520
I'm gonna wager zero dollars.

1409
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,280
Cause I'm rich.

1410
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,620
You don't get to choose.

1411
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,060
Seven.

1412
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:49,900
Uh-oh.

1413
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,400
Give me your money, guys.

1414
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:52,500
No!

1415
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,940
28 coins on the line.

1416
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,540
Let's do this.

1417
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,900
Oh, trampoline, I'm on one.

1418
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,060
You're on a trampoline?

1419
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:06,980
Yeah.

1420
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,720
Can I come over?

1421
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:09,700
Yes.

1422
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,180
I want to play.

1423
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,480
Whatever you want, we can do it.

1424
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:14,520
Yes.

1425
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,120
Oh, not this.

1426
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,340
Okay, let's just go.

1427
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:17,920
Let's just go.

1428
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,580
Just go, just play, just play.

1429
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,660
We all have the same idea.

1430
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,020
Sop.

1431
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,620
By the way, guys.

1432
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,140
Here's someone.

1433
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,140
That's winning because nobody is doing anything.

1434
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,080
You effing quickie!

1435
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,200
Quick you!

1436
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:50,700
Quick you!

1437
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,320
Quick you!

1438
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,580
Now that's my shit.

1439
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,420
Hold up.

1440
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,800
That's my shit.

1441
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,880
That's my shit.

1442
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,080
I like how nobody is that bothering Zen.

1443
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,220
Nobody ever expects the toaster.

1444
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,620
It's cool.

1445
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,680
Yeah!

1446
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,940
Thank you for the coins.

1447
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,960
I lost coins.

1448
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,640
It's because you stole my freaking star!

1449
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,660
The rich isn't getting rich!

1450
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,660
You stole my freaking star!

1451
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,000
I was right behind you and I was begging.

1452
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,180
I said no, please.

1453
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,880
That is the most Twitter logic I've ever seen.

1454
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,680
It was my star!

1455
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,700
The stars didn't know you, bro!

1456
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,300
No!

1457
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:43,480
Oh!

1458
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,280
You can steal an item from...

1459
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,240
You can steal an item from Fillion.

1460
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,320
No!

1461
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,900
No!

1462
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,360
It's too me!

1463
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:51,620
No!

1464
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,060
No!

1465
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,640
Then, it was too me.

1466
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,720
I couldn't.

1467
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,680
You're weak.

1468
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,660
She's pitying me.

1469
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,280
Not yet anyway.

1470
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,660
I have a 24 card.

1471
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,080
Instead, gonna go ahead and do this.

1472
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:08,960
Oh!

1473
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:09,320
No!

1474
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,460
Brother, are you...

1475
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:11,840
Please!

1476
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:13,940
What did I...

1477
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,580
No, okay.

1478
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,200
Okay, so, hey, okay.

1479
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,000
So...

1480
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,340
Yeah, she's the rich...

1481
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:17,820
Second richest.

1482
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,340
Yeah, she's rich.

1483
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,860
I love you.

1484
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,840
Zen, have I ever said that...

1485
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,440
Fillion has been...

1486
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,140
Have I ever said that you are...

1487
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,940
Beautiful and...

1488
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,960
So kind and...

1489
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,220
And she has the most money.

1490
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,220
And you know...

1491
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:35,820
You motherfucker.

1492
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,780
I didn't sing her star!

1493
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,580
And I just want to know her on Twitter!

1494
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,720
Rate the Twitter for you.

1495
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:45,960
Yay!

1496
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,000
Yippee!

1497
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,820
Stop being a baby!

1498
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:52,700
What?

1499
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,360
I'm getting modded by my own people!

1500
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,300
Can I have your money?

1501
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,040
Oh, oh.

1502
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,480
Thank you.

1503
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,720
That's how it happens.

1504
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,780
It's always the people you most...

1505
00:45:59,780 --> 00:45:59,900
No!

1506
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,340
You expect the most.

1507
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,120
Damn, that's a lot.

1508
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,160
Oh my God, Seth.

1509
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:03,700
You know...

1510
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,040
Oh my God.

1511
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,900
It usually takes like 12.

1512
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,400
Jesus.

1513
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,340
You know, you could have swatted the booze away, right, Fillion?

1514
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:11,960
Were you not pressing?

1515
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,320
Oh, could I play this game before?

1516
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,800
I thought you said you played these games before.

1517
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:21,860
Yeah, you said that.

1518
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,780
That's what you told me.

1519
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,260
That's what you told me.

1520
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,320
Mamma mia.

1521
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,120
Wait.

1522
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,520
Have you even seen Squid Game?

1523
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,560
Question mark.

1524
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:31,960
What in the world?

1525
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,100
Of course.

1526
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,060
Oh, I'm sure it's just coins.

1527
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:36,980
Yay!

1528
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,860
You're so rich now.

1529
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,320
Oh my God, she's got 69 coins, bro.

1530
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,440
She's got the entire US GDP in her pocket.

1531
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:42,780
Nice.

1532
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,880
What do I...

1533
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,780
You guys are so far ahead.

1534
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,540
Can you wait for me?

1535
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,660
The star might show up near you, Mari.

1536
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:51,360
How do I own?

1537
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,120
How do I own?

1538
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,900
Um...

1539
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,800
I...

1540
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,120
Will go...

1541
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,080
And...

1542
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,460
And...

1543
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,260
I'm just gonna try to roll really high.

1544
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,160
Okay.

1545
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,780
That's more than one.

1546
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,200
Yeah.

1547
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,580
So it's technically high.

1548
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,100
Yeah.

1549
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,820
It's technically very high.

1550
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,580
It's double...

1551
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,620
Oh, it's double than your last roll.

1552
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,000
Wait.

1553
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,320
That's big, though.

1554
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,380
Maybe.

1555
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,100
Let's see.

1556
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,860
Two items.

1557
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:21,660
See.

1558
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,920
That makes it up.

1559
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,900
Oh, sorry.

1560
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,320
Nothing.

1561
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,960
Oh, you got the shot?

1562
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,520
Wait.

1563
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,240
That's it?

1564
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,380
Oh, okay.

1565
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,200
Oh, triple dice!

1566
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:31,740
Triple dice!

1567
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:32,940
That's okay.

1568
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,080
Yeah.

1569
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,060
That's more than two.

1570
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,700
Lucky me.

1571
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,340
You can get more than two now.

1572
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:39,860
Mini game!

1573
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:40,980
Yay.

1574
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,260
In the next round, I can use my triple dice and I can roll three.

1575
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,980
What's the difference?

1576
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:50,820
What'd it do?

1577
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,740
If you roll a three, I'm giving you a 100 subs with those three dices.

1578
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,080
Really?

1579
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,580
Well, that might be worth it.

1580
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:00,740
Wait, what?

1581
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,040
What am I doing?

1582
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,140
Ooh.

1583
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,700
Wait, I didn't...

1584
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:04,940
Oh!

1585
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,060
You gotta get the difference or...

1586
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,260
Okay.

1587
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:08,460
Oh.

1588
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,240
What?

1589
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,000
I was impressed with the wrong one.

1590
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,380
Just like this.

1591
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,000
Which way do you hold the Wiimote?

1592
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,000
What?

1593
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:15,680
What?

1594
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,960
What?

1595
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,400
Wait, wait.

1596
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,380
Which way do you hold the Wiimote?

1597
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,980
What does this do?

1598
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,800
You're holding a Wiimote?

1599
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,520
Wait, so who picked the right one?

1600
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,920
Does one pick the right one at the same time as me?

1601
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:25,580
What?

1602
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:26,500
No.

1603
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,100
Am I stupid?

1604
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,780
You gotta wait till you see the whole picture.

1605
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:29,800
Yeah, wait, yeah.

1606
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:30,960
Oh.

1607
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:31,260
Technically.

1608
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,780
I mean, you don't have...

1609
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,000
Oops.

1610
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,220
What?

1611
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,180
Oh.

1612
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,320
Oh, the odd one out!

1613
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:39,860
Oh!

1614
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,200
Like that.

1615
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,280
Yeah.

1616
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:42,780
Understood.

1617
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:43,780
There you go.

1618
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,100
Understood.

1619
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:44,840
Yeah.

1620
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,460
The auto went out.

1621
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,300
Okay, here we go.

1622
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,460
Start.

1623
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,540
Who skipped my cutscene?

1624
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,580
I did.

1625
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,600
Lock in.

1626
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,100
You don't wanna see it.

1627
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,820
Come on.

1628
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,760
Bananas.

1629
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,540
Bananas.

1630
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,480
Bananas.

1631
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,040
Bananas.

1632
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:58,400
Bananas.

1633
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,580
Grape!

1634
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:00,980
Grape!

1635
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,640
I'm a player.

1636
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,380
Those are the fastest.

1637
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,200
Dang.

1638
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,320
Damn.

1639
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:08,860
Centrae is so fast.

1640
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,000
I got last.

1641
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:11,940
Round two.

1642
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:12,980
Okay.

1643
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,080
Here we go.

1644
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:14,780
Lock it in.

1645
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:15,840
Come on.

1646
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:16,700
Lock it in.

1647
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,080
Okay.

1648
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:18,680
I'm...

1649
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,220
I'm going for this one.

1650
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,240
Hey!

1651
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,520
Stop edging!

1652
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,400
That is some serious edging.

1653
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:29,700
Oh!

1654
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,080
Oh, shit!

1655
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,360
That's awful.

1656
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,340
I gambled.

1657
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,960
I gambled it all.

1658
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,180
If I gambled all...

1659
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,420
So wait, it's the odd one out, right?

1660
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah.

1661
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,820
It's whichever one that's just by itself.

1662
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,760
Guys, I think that's a banana.

1663
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,100
Oh.

1664
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,640
This is gonna be numbered.

1665
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,120
Oh, I think I knew that.

1666
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:51,440
Oh.

1667
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,200
I'm a genius.

1668
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:55,880
Am I old?

1669
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,440
Oh my god.

1670
00:49:59,300 --> 00:49:59,880
Oh.

1671
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,500
She's locked the fuck in.

1672
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:02,420
Yeah.

1673
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:02,940
I'm a failure.

1674
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:03,620
Holy.

1675
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,020
I already forgot.

1676
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,980
That's what my dad said.

1677
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,280
I already forgot what they look like.

1678
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,480
Wait, is my stupid...

1679
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,680
This one...

1680
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,460
Oh, shit.

1681
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,140
Oh, my...

1682
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,280
I died!

1683
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,740
I clicked the right one!

1684
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,960
I forgot to me.

1685
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:21,940
I figured the other one!

1686
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,280
Oh my god.

1687
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,860
I might be a bot.

1688
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,820
Let's fucking go.

1689
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:27,880
I'm a bot.

1690
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,240
I'm a player.

1691
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:30,540
I'm a player.

1692
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,480
Oh my god, stop.

1693
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,480
Absolute suffering.

1694
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,180
Wait, what was it?

1695
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:34,800
No, you're having fun.

1696
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:35,740
I'm walking in.

1697
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,360
Wait.

1698
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,360
I put the wrong button.

1699
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,940
I think I got...

1700
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,840
Oh, at least I got...

1701
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,500
Oh, yeah!

1702
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,300
I got third!

1703
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:44,980
Let's go!

1704
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,100
At least I'm third.

1705
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:48,980
Not last.

1706
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:49,240
Yes.

1707
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,820
Did I get last place?

1708
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,440
How do I know?

1709
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:54,940
You'll know.

1710
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,860
Yeah, definitely get first.

1711
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:57,720
I'll tell you that one.

1712
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,660
I love gambling.

1713
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:03,860
Yay!

1714
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,760
What you crying about?

1715
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,720
You have a star.

1716
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,180
You're a star.

1717
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,960
Aw, thank you.

1718
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,160
You do?

1719
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,320
What the fuck?

1720
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,280
Yes, she has a star!

1721
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,220
No, I don't!

1722
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,580
She stole it from me!

1723
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:18,960
Stop!

1724
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,980
Grow up, Cillian!

1725
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,860
How about you...

1726
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,520
Get taller!

1727
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,960
I'm stealing your fucking spell.

1728
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,140
How about you...

1729
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,380
Just shut your mouth...

1730
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:28,580
Oh, yeah!

1731
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,020
Well, I'm gonna steal fucking...

1732
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,250
Ladies, ladies...

1733
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,100
Let's fight...

1734
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,560
Oh, shit.

1735
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,460
To live.

1736
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,020
That's what I thought.

1737
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,120
Okay.

1738
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,540
Die spot.

1739
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,470
The lady...

1740
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,440
In the meantime, can you tell your mom to cook us some hot pockets?

1741
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,300
Yeah.

1742
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:44,800
Thanks.

1743
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,700
I want a pizza.

1744
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,320
You like that?

1745
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,420
That shit's good.

1746
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,400
Oh, yeah.

1747
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,540
Oh, yeah.

1748
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:57,960
Big time.

1749
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,680
And the bologna sandwich.

1750
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,960
Oh, my God.

1751
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:05,780
Double digits.

1752
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:07,700
Oh.

1753
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:07,920
Wow.

1754
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,420
Oh, thank God.

1755
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,900
We hit the Bowser block.

1756
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,780
That's not fair.

1757
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,320
Bye, train.

1758
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:16,600
Oh, train.

1759
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:17,820
Bye.

1760
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,100
Oh, no.

1761
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,240
Can I get the board in?

1762
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:22,680
Fuck.

1763
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,580
That's right.

1764
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,860
Now you're even further from the star.

1765
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:27,420
One day.

1766
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:27,840
Don't worry.

1767
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:28,780
Not today.

1768
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,140
No.

1769
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:29,480
No.

1770
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,700
Let's see.

1771
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,620
Maybe he could go to a shop.

1772
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,300
Actually, I do this.

1773
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:39,300
Yeah.

1774
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:39,440
Yeah.

1775
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:40,780
It'd be.

1776
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,720
Oh.

1777
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:43,520
It'd be like.

1778
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:43,640
It'd be like.

1779
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,020
Run around the entire planet.

1780
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:45,440
Wow.

1781
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:45,840
Amazing.

1782
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,800
Use an item and somehow you're still in front of me.

1783
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,440
What was the highest number you rolled, Mari?

1784
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:53,780
Okay.

1785
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,960
Of five, I think.

1786
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:55,480
Wait.

1787
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,580
That's pretty big.

1788
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,860
You have 72 points.

1789
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,180
Is that enough for you?

1790
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,840
I was gonna say, Zen, you have 72 coins.

1791
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,080
I think you'd be fine spending just a little bit more.

1792
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:05,960
I am fine.

1793
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,240
Might do a silly here.

1794
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:09,640
Would you get richer?

1795
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,360
Chad, am I winning?

1796
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,560
If nobody gets the train.

1797
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,280
I won't hit the train.

1798
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,640
I know what you're doing.

1799
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,100
Cookie.

1800
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:19,320
No.

1801
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,440
Okay.

1802
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,080
I understand your game.

1803
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,160
I can do a roger.

1804
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,580
What?

1805
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,040
I really haven't made these games before.

1806
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,020
I hope you get three ones.

1807
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,180
Nine.

1808
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,200
Oh my god.

1809
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,500
Nine.

1810
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:35,860
Nine.

1811
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,540
Nine, nine, nine?

1812
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:37,740
Oh.

1813
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,440
Ten dollars.

1814
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:39,700
Holy shit.

1815
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,660
Let's go.

1816
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,700
She stored all her luck there now.

1817
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,480
I've never seen somebody get that big of a number.

1818
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:47,720
Yeah.

1819
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,220
She actually stored all...

1820
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:49,400
Jesus Christ.

1821
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,500
You should get the chomp chomp.

1822
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,260
Whistle.

1823
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,480
Oh...

1824
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:54,480
Um...

1825
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,000
I want...

1826
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,760
I wanna...

1827
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,120
Yeah, chomp call is good.

1828
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,220
Yeah, the chomp call is good.

1829
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:00,440
Yeah, the chomp call is good.

1830
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,140
How do I hear you?

1831
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:02,720
Yeah.

1832
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,360
I wanna do hair hair.

1833
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,240
You have to be wild, Luigi.

1834
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,760
Everyone is so jealous of my huge, disgusting numbers.

1835
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,540
Oh yeah.

1836
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:14,960
Wait, did you just...

1837
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,320
Oh.

1838
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,320
Huh?

1839
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,300
Uh...

1840
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,900
Wait, is that gonna steal your money to go right?

1841
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:19,520
No.

1842
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,680
She has to land...

1843
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,500
Add it specifically.

1844
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:22,800
Oh...

1845
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,920
So it's useless.

1846
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,020
Wait, I need a...

1847
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,000
Do I need a key?

1848
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:27,920
Yeah, yeah.

1849
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,080
Thank you.

1850
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:29,820
Yes.

1851
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:30,860
I think.

1852
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,540
Yeah, yeah.

1853
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,880
Wait, I don't even have a key.

1854
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,080
Wait.

1855
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,640
I can still reach the star.

1856
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,720
You do have enough numbers, though.

1857
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,080
Yeah, you have enough for the star.

1858
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:40,520
Yes.

1859
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,560
Brother, leave my point alone.

1860
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,360
Not it.

1861
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:46,300
I'm gonna steal.

1862
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,780
Okay, not it.

1863
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,300
If you steal Fillion's money, she won't have enough for the star.

1864
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,940
No, Ebuz, I have 19 coins.

1865
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,500
The second star!

1866
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,580
Zed has 72 bucks!

1867
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,160
Yeah, but Fillion won't have enough to buy a second star.

1868
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,320
I didn't have a star.

1869
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,400
You steal her money.

1870
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:00,960
Yeah.

1871
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,480
Fillion, you have a star, so I need to steal your money.

1872
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,220
Yo, you guys, you guys use anything for an excuse.

1873
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,320
This is a crazy one.

1874
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,400
Well, you're in first place.

1875
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,560
That is an excuse.

1876
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,280
Why do I always get bronze with a brawl?

1877
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,360
You better stop pressing.

1878
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,240
I gotta start messing with it.

1879
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,720
Yeah, you push it really fast.

1880
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,040
Press.

1881
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:20,740
Click.

1882
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,100
I'm in.

1883
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:21,740
I'm in.

1884
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:21,920
I'm in.

1885
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,020
Fast.

1886
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:25,440
Correct!

1887
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,740
And when I say fast, like really fast.

1888
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,480
Nice.

1889
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:29,840
Yeah.

1890
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,320
That was pretty good.

1891
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,940
That was a good steal.

1892
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,920
I would have preferred to have 17 coins though.

1893
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:37,740
Wario!

1894
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,040
Yes!

1895
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,460
Yes!

1896
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,920
What does he get for the ally?

1897
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,220
It's an ally minigame.

1898
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,740
Oh, we all have to fight for it.

1899
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,820
We all fight for him.

1900
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,840
We have fighting for his big ass.

1901
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,320
But since I met him first, he gives me the advantage.

1902
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:56,260
Yeah.

1903
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,780
Guys, we can't let her get her.

1904
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,680
She'll get two stars.

1905
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:00,920
Yeah.

1906
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,800
But it would be nice.

1907
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,340
Cause Mario's a lot of spam.

1908
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,120
It must be everyone with Mario party.

1909
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,660
The fuck is this one?

1910
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,500
Oh, it's a...

1911
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:11,680
Oh, no.

1912
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,660
Quiz show.

1913
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:13,940
Wait, what?

1914
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,120
What is this?

1915
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,040
I'm a genius.

1916
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:19,580
What?

1917
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,140
What is this?

1918
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,300
Oh, like which one's different?

1919
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,200
Yeah.

1920
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:22,800
Oh.

1921
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,500
It's like that last one.

1922
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,500
It's all just game show games.

1923
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,960
Wait, what?

1924
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,880
There's different games?

1925
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,060
Yeah.

1926
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,140
Ready up.

1927
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,300
Okay.

1928
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:35,980
Oh, man.

1929
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,940
Let's go.

1930
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,760
Oh, this is complicated.

1931
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,640
Hi, Wario.

1932
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,560
I am... I love him.

1933
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,000
Look at that ass.

1934
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,120
He's huge.

1935
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,560
Yeah.

1936
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,420
Start.

1937
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,200
Round one.

1938
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720
What?

1939
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,080
What?

1940
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:55,440
What?

1941
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:55,720
What?

1942
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,400
What?

1943
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:56,580
What?

1944
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:57,400
Oh.

1945
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:04,980
I won.

1946
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:05,320
I won.

1947
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,280
Fuck.

1948
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,640
Jack, you should be looking at my controller.

1949
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:13,960
Round two.

1950
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,680
This is just... Oh, it's like WarioWare.

1951
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,320
What's happening?

1952
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,180
What's happening?

1953
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:20,900
What?

1954
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,240
What?

1955
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,160
You have to pick the longest.

1956
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:22,640
Oh, yeah.

1957
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:24,980
Wow.

1958
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,760
Round three.

1959
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:27,360
Jesus.

1960
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,140
Nah.

1961
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,800
Oh, it's this one.

1962
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,700
We did this one.

1963
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,080
Mari is on fire.

1964
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,120
Yay.

1965
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,660
How did you get that so fast?

1966
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:37,980
Aw.

1967
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,780
He was holding hands.

1968
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:41,880
Oh.

1969
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,380
How many coins is there?

1970
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,720
Like 18.

1971
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,080
Oh.

1972
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:49,800
I failed.

1973
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,900
I pressed the wrong one.

1974
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,380
I might have drawn.

1975
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,140
I might have drawn.

1976
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:52,440
Yay.

1977
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,660
Wait, I did that.

1978
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,560
I thought I was 11.

1979
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,440
I thought I was 11.

1980
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,300
It's hard to count.

1981
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,180
It's hard to count.

1982
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,020
Fuck math.

1983
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,160
Oh, my lord.

1984
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,960
Oh, no shit.

1985
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:06,320
Aw.

1986
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:06,860
Is that it?

1987
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:07,520
Aw.

1988
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,960
Wait, is it filling in my dead end?

1989
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:10,480
Jesus.

1990
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,020
Double points.

1991
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,260
I'm back, baby.

1992
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,060
Oh, double points is where it's at.

1993
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,260
What the hell?

1994
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:19,940
Wait, did I win?

1995
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,440
Am I so fucking happy?

1996
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,380
I got three fucking points.

1997
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,480
How many more rounds?

1998
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,020
Five more?

1999
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,960
Where will he stop?

2000
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,300
How do I get a no-world guy stop?

2001
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:28,600
Goddamn.

2002
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,100
I'm a failure.

2003
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,900
Well, how did you click so fast?

2004
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,960
It's double points, too.

2005
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:42,340
Oh, damn.

2006
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:42,420
Wait.

2007
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,680
I might be able to come back.

2008
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:46,680
Wait.

2009
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:47,720
Wait.

2010
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,360
Oh, my God.

2011
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,620
It was so fast.

2012
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:49,820
She's doing it.

2013
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,660
She's aiming.

2014
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,060
She's aiming.

2015
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:51,420
Oh, my God.

2016
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,720
She's locking in now.

2017
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,960
Fillion, stop.

2018
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,340
There's three more rounds.

2019
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,300
I did this.

2020
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:57,840
You're in the first.

2021
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,320
You're in the first.

2022
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,600
Oh.

2023
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,060
Ah.

2024
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,480
I was trying to click not eight.

2025
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:03,900
Oh.

2026
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:04,480
Oh, yes.

2027
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:04,880
It's eight.

2028
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,020
Oh, no.

2029
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,740
I pressed the wrong button.

2030
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,040
I counted wrong again.

2031
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,480
Fillion, stop.

2032
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:14,880
I'm stupid.

2033
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,960
Why don't you just...

2034
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,720
Oh, I pressed the wrong button.

2035
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:17,720
Fuuuuck.

2036
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:18,740
What is the wrong button?

2037
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,560
No, it's the wrong button.

2038
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:19,740
Wait.

2039
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,800
We all got it wrong.

2040
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,640
I got peer-pression.

2041
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,980
We might have peer-pression.

2042
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,080
I got peer-pression.

2043
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,760
I got peer-pression.

2044
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,260
I heard the sound.

2045
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,220
I was like, okay.

2046
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:31,860
Yes.

2047
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,640
Isn't it right, so...

2048
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,000
Oh.

2049
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,660
Holy shit.

2050
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:37,580
Oh, shit.

2051
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,120
Oh, shit.

2052
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,780
Wait, did I win?

2053
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:41,580
Yes.

2054
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:41,940
Oh!

2055
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:42,840
Yeah!

2056
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:43,920
What the fuck?

2057
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,700
Oh, my God.

2058
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,580
It's okay, you guys can steal my money again.

2059
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,580
It's fine.

2060
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,360
You can steal my money.

2061
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:50,740
Alright.

2062
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,340
The key...

2063
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:57,440
Yeah, the key is to make sure she has no money to get any stars.

2064
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,580
That's the key.

2065
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,660
I hope you get more stolen from you than just your money, Fillion.

2066
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:03,640
Whoa.

2067
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,940
Like in Minecraft, right?

2068
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,580
Bro, I got a bestie.

2069
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,160
No, in Mario Party.

2070
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:12,120
What?

2071
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,800
Wait, so don't anyone pass me?

2072
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,600
Wait, they're gonna steal my boy?

2073
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,280
I hope you enjoy him.

2074
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:17,560
What do you do?

2075
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,080
Yeah, as long as someone passes you, you lose Wario.

2076
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,240
Like, he's not... he's not loyal.

2077
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:23,720
Okay.

2078
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,360
I'm gonna land on a Bowser space?

2079
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:25,720
Yeah.

2080
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,840
We're stealing your boy.

2081
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:27,740
Ah, fuck it.

2082
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,940
I don't car.

2083
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:34,880
What's happening?

2084
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:36,080
What's happening?

2085
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:36,940
I'm gonna land on a Bowser.

2086
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:37,480
I'm buying a star.

2087
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,460
There's no loser star on that Bowser.

2088
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,440
You got a star.

2089
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,020
Ah.

2090
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,680
I could have got two stars if I had Wario.

2091
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,280
And hopefully, we'd land on it.

2092
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,200
I have to.

2093
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:48,260
I have to.

2094
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,780
My chat's writing fanfics with Wario already.

2095
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,400
Where's the next star?

2096
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,080
Look, it's right in front of me.

2097
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:53,960
Wait, it is.

2098
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:54,580
Wait, what?

2099
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,440
That's a lot of people's dreams.

2100
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,680
That's not even randomized.

2101
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,240
Oh my god, she can nearly buy a second star.

2102
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:00,800
Yeah.

2103
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,460
Oh my god.

2104
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,480
That'd be crazy.

2105
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:05,720
Holy shit.

2106
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:06,920
Lucky me.

2107
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,220
Well, you got your two stars.

2108
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:09,440
Yay.

2109
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,080
Shit.

2110
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,580
Then it's time to go to the booze cap.

2111
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,400
It's time to go to the booze cave.

2112
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,540
I'm gonna land on the bowser space.

2113
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,840
It might get stolen anyway.

2114
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,860
She just asked him for the novel.

2115
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,960
Wait, who's in front of this star?

2116
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,920
Hey, it's for me.

2117
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:27,900
Lucky.

2118
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,380
Steamer ticket.

2119
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:32,980
You're broke.

2120
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,140
Oh, you don't get it.

2121
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:34,860
You don't get it.

2122
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,040
Oh, wait.

2123
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,100
You miscounted.

2124
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:37,600
Holy shit.

2125
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:38,560
Nice.

2126
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,600
Oh, because of the stars thing.

2127
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,380
Yahoo!

2128
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:42,360
No way.

2129
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,180
Lucky, lucky.

2130
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:43,500
Lucky.

2131
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,320
And a hidden block?

2132
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,160
Okay, it's not a star.

2133
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:47,780
Thank God.

2134
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,140
I wanna know.

2135
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,440
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

2136
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,440
Lucky, lucky.

2137
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:53,720
Lucky, lucky.

2138
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,080
Mini game.

2139
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,380
Well, you got Wario fillion, so it's okay.

2140
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,920
Oh, I got Wario.

2141
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,040
You got two stars!

2142
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,760
We're on the same team.

2143
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,960
You have to lock in.

2144
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:03,960
Two axes taxis.

2145
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,040
I'm going to sandbag you.

2146
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,440
Zen, this might not be my day, Zen.

2147
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,000
Got you.

2148
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,240
Don't worry.

2149
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:13,120
What is this?

2150
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:13,660
What do we do?

2151
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,900
I go side to side.

2152
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,160
I go forward.

2153
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,700
You go up and down.

2154
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:18,740
Oh.

2155
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:19,980
What?

2156
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:20,840
Am I controlling this car?

2157
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,000
You're controlling side to side movement, and I'm controlling the down movement.

2158
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:25,400
Yep.

2159
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:26,120
There you go.

2160
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:26,880
Wait, am I doing this?

2161
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,300
We got this.

2162
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,540
How do we turn?

2163
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:30,580
Oh.

2164
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:31,520
With you!

2165
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,160
Oh, I gotta hold it!

2166
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:33,700
Oh!

2167
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,140
Nice.

2168
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:34,680
Oh!

2169
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,460
We can't do it at the same time.

2170
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,380
I noticed that.

2171
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:38,400
Oh!

2172
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:38,840
Alright, let's get it.

2173
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,120
She's really good at this.

2174
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:41,800
Go.

2175
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,680
You better...

2176
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:42,920
Alright.

2177
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:44,820
You better lock in.

2178
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,620
I can only do well during the practice.

2179
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,460
I'm going to kill you.

2180
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:47,680
Practice.

2181
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:48,700
What?

2182
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,340
I'm going to make us lose, Mari.

2183
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,200
No!

2184
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,160
We can do this if we just...

2185
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,540
I'm going to make us lose.

2186
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:54,560
I'm going to make us lose.

2187
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,760
This is what you deserve.

2188
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,200
That's...

2189
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:57,440
Stop!

2190
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:57,640
Stop!

2191
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:57,940
Go!

2192
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,660
Let go!

2193
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:00,940
Let go forward!

2194
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,480
Okay.

2195
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,200
Turn!

2196
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,440
It's up to you.

2197
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,360
You turn, bro!

2198
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:05,940
It's up to you.

2199
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,280
And then I'll go.

2200
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,100
Still going.

2201
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,240
Alright.

2202
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:12,780
Nice.

2203
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,380
Oh my god.

2204
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:15,820
Go.

2205
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:16,480
Go.

2206
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,080
Go.

2207
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:18,680
Yes!

2208
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,200
Come on, come on.

2209
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:19,880
We're in the way, we're in the way.

2210
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:20,460
No!

2211
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:23,800
Keep going!

2212
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:24,820
We have to wait!

2213
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,940
Wait for it!

2214
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:26,240
Stop!

2215
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:26,620
Stop!

2216
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,260
Nice, nice, nice!

2217
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:28,860
Oh, wait.

2218
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:29,720
Bro!

2219
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:30,920
You.

2220
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:31,800
I'm going to go!

2221
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:31,820
Yo.

2222
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:33,400
You're mom!

2223
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,020
You, you, you.

2224
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,500
It's going on!

2225
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,680
Nice line.

2226
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,120
It's a cock!

2227
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:37,980
Go!

2228
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:38,860
More, more, more!

2229
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,240
Down!

2230
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,160
Yes!

2231
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,120
Up!

2232
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:43,360
Wow!

2233
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:43,680
Hut!

2234
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:43,900
Hut!

2235
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:43,960
Hut!

2236
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,560
Two, three, four!

2237
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:44,920
Hut!

2238
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:45,180
Hut!

2239
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,120
Two, three, four!

2240
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:48,940
Hut!

2241
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:49,700
It's okay.

2242
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,680
Go to RNG and we're back.

2243
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,680
Go to RNG and we're back.

2244
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,160
Go to RNG and we're back.

2245
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:53,960
Go, go, go, go.

2246
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:54,620
Oh, good stuff.

2247
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,840
Oh, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running!

2248
01:03:59,080 --> 01:03:59,260
Yay!

2249
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:01,920
Okay, I actually locked in.

2250
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:02,280
Holy shit.

2251
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,880
I actually locked in for that, just for you, Zen.

2252
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,140
It's because Villian threw.

2253
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,380
It was teamwork makes the dream work.

2254
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,620
I could see that.

2255
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,620
The vision is real.

2256
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,700
Nah, I have enough for a star.

2257
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,560
My teammate threw.

2258
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,900
I should get compensation.

2259
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:26,140
I'm sorry.

2260
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,960
You guys joined the entire game.

2261
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,860
And then when I crashed out, it's my fault.

2262
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,160
Am I the bad guy?

2263
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,200
What is this guy doing?

2264
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,160
Don't touch me.

2265
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,840
How come you're locked in whenever you're by yourself, but you don't lock in for Mario?

2266
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:37,860
That's fucked up.

2267
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:38,800
Is he my sugar daddy?

2268
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,300
Damn.

2269
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,580
I think you're...

2270
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,840
I mean, sort of.

2271
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,080
It's Renowario.

2272
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,340
You're living a lot of people's dreams right now.

2273
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:47,700
One.

2274
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,300
You're living my dream.

2275
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,840
Yeah, one of Wario's the man from you.

2276
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,740
I mean, he's got the booty.

2277
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,140
Whoa!

2278
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,060
It's true.

2279
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,740
Wait, what's happening?

2280
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:01,200
I got two?

2281
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,200
You get two, because Wario gives you two.

2282
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,480
Dang, Wario OP!

2283
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:06,300
Oh god!

2284
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:07,960
My man, okay!

2285
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,640
Yeah, because you have friends now.

2286
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,580
Yeah!

2287
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,720
Oh my god, it's gonna be so long until I get anywhere.

2288
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:22,510
Goodbye Bowser, blah.

2289
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,830
Still not too bad.

2290
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:24,810
No worries.

2291
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:29,610
Maybe eventually something will show up in front of me.

2292
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:30,670
This is gonna be crazy.

2293
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,490
I know how to cheer everybody up.

2294
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,730
By getting a star!

2295
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,930
Well, some people anyway.

2296
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:39,650
Are you gonna steal?

2297
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:41,250
No.

2298
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,290
Wait, what are you gonna do?

2299
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:44,670
What's happening?

2300
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:45,450
What are you doing?

2301
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:46,690
To where?

2302
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,010
What are you doing?

2303
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,470
Something really fucked up.

2304
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:51,570
What are you doing?

2305
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:52,570
Stop!

2306
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:53,070
What are you doing?

2307
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:56,390
What?

2308
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,050
Am I in danger?

2309
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:57,750
Zen!

2310
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:00,590
Let's talk about it, okay?

2311
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,150
Like, okay, I'm not in the lead anymore.

2312
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:02,790
Mariah has two stars.

2313
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:05,230
50 gifted subs to Zen from Filian if you...

2314
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:06,850
If you wasn't.

2315
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:08,610
You guys have e-boyed me long enough.

2316
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,270
You guys are...

2317
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,910
Twitter begging right now.

2318
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,050
Like, come on.

2319
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:15,270
Zen, don't do this.

2320
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:16,870
Filian, I don't know what...

2321
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:17,150
Eh?

2322
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:21,130
Who's at that?

2323
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,150
Yeah, you get more.

2324
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,630
I wonder who she'll choose.

2325
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,010
Filian!

2326
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:32,330
She's gonna do something really funny.

2327
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:33,330
Zen, you have to...

2328
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,690
I'm gonna sit here right now, okay?

2329
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,150
You either do the really funny...

2330
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:38,630
Or you show your true colors.

2331
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:40,550
Wait, no.

2332
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:41,150
You show...

2333
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:42,450
You...

2334
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:43,490
Have I ever told you?

2335
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,390
I really...

2336
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:45,170
Think you can...

2337
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:45,670
I can...

2338
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,210
You're...

2339
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:46,490
Wow.

2340
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:47,630
She doesn't even have...

2341
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:50,170
She can't even think of one good thing to say to you.

2342
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:50,490
Um...

2343
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:51,890
That's a...

2344
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:54,450
I can't even think of one good compliment.

2345
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:55,310
I love this lab.

2346
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,350
Yeah, you're a neuro.

2347
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:57,750
I think you're really cool.

2348
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:01,870
And I like that we got a Bondo for Pokemon cards so soon.

2349
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:04,450
And I think you're really witty and funny.

2350
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,750
And I hope that...

2351
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:07,590
We can...

2352
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:08,410
Be...

2353
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,010
Closer friends after this.

2354
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:12,370
That's so fucked up.

2355
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:14,270
That Filian can't even say one thing.

2356
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:14,610
I think...

2357
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:15,470
When your TTS doesn't win...

2358
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:16,630
It's pretty...

2359
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:17,210
It's content.

2360
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:21,230
And also, Filian called you a slur.

2361
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:22,050
No!

2362
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:22,650
True!

2363
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:23,650
She...

2364
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:24,570
She called us...

2365
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:25,510
She said a slur!

2366
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:26,450
True!

2367
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,070
Hey, hey, Doki!

2368
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,770
And she didn't get a pass for it too!

2369
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:30,610
Hey, Doki!

2370
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:30,970
I already got it for that one.

2371
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:32,810
I can't use it again.

2372
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:34,270
She said it twice.

2373
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,410
Yeah, she didn't get the pass.

2374
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:40,070
How about I do something super fair?

2375
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:41,310
No.

2376
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:41,750
No.

2377
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,230
It's Mario Party.

2378
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:43,490
No.

2379
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:44,530
There's no such thing as fair.

2380
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,390
It's Mario Party!

2381
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:50,170
You can't steal my star.

2382
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:51,990
Every time I play with...

2383
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,830
Yes, Vivian.

2384
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:53,370
That's rude.

2385
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,850
Legal government statement.

2386
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:57,570
Make a poll in your chat.

2387
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:58,790
No.

2388
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,650
And see who I should steal the star from.

2389
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:04,650
Yeah, Filian.

2390
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:06,530
That's a really good idea, but sadly...

2391
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,850
There's zero viewers right now, so...

2392
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:10,390
Oh, you know what's so awesome?

2393
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:13,850
I'm a moderator in Filian's chat, so I can make a poll.

2394
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:14,270
That's really interesting!

2395
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:15,150
Yeah.

2396
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:15,890
That's really interesting.

2397
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:20,030
I can make a poll right now, so I'll go in Filian's chat and I'll make a poll.

2398
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:20,290
Get out of my...

2399
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:20,970
By all means.

2400
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:21,830
See, guys?

2401
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:24,510
Look, having zero stars is a good thing sometimes.

2402
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,890
Just so we can get an unbiased opinion.

2403
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,090
Yeah.

2404
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:27,990
So, like...

2405
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:29,270
Okay, Zen, so...

2406
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,470
You know, like...

2407
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,210
Like, you called me Vivian and, like, I thought that was okay.

2408
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,190
You know, we can grow past, like, our mistakes.

2409
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:38,490
And, um...

2410
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:38,850
What is...

2411
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:39,330
I voted?

2412
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:41,630
Brother, this is not the presidential election.

2413
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:43,150
Nice poll!

2414
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,030
What does the poll say?

2415
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:44,890
I can't read it.

2416
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:46,510
I can't read the poll.

2417
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:47,270
I'm biased.

2418
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,830
It says Filian.

2419
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,410
Wow.

2420
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:51,050
Who would've...

2421
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:52,710
The game was rigged since the start.

2422
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:53,730
I know.

2423
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,510
It looks like...

2424
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,930
It looks like...

2425
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:56,730
A thousand people...

2426
01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:58,730
Wait, what just happened?

2427
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:00,030
Oh, yay.

2428
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:01,410
Oh, yay.

2429
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:03,870
Oh, yay.

2430
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,240
Don't blame me.

2431
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,400
Blame democracy in the chat.

2432
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:10,980
I'm a tree!

2433
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:18,310
Don't they say, like, chat reflects the streamer?

2434
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,850
I hate Mario Party!

2435
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,810
I never wanna play this game again!

2436
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:28,750
Every time I hate my doggy bird, she's like, what?

2437
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,250
Let's gang up on Filian.

2438
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:31,190
And I never wanna play...

2439
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:32,210
That's not true!

2440
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,050
When did I do that?

2441
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:34,230
When did I do that?

2442
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,090
I like the funny reaction!

2443
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,830
Oh, the funny reaction!

2444
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:44,510
It's okay, Filian.

2445
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:44,850
Chat!

2446
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:45,450
Clip that!

2447
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:45,810
Chat!

2448
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:46,510
Clip that!

2449
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:48,870
I think Chat maybe just wants you to lose the game.

2450
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:50,470
Done.

2451
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,510
Filian...

2452
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:55,350
What did I do?

2453
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,190
I have zero stars!

2454
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,010
Do you need your binky?

2455
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,250
Do you need your binky?

2456
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,550
Do you need your rattle?

2457
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:03,050
Hey, Mari!

2458
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:03,090
What?

2459
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:04,590
Love yourself.

2460
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:05,170
Now.

2461
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:07,790
I do!

2462
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,250
Thank you very much.

2463
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,510
Great, I just have to be sure.

2464
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:11,390
I care about you.

2465
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:12,930
Keep yourself safe.

2466
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:14,450
I care about you too.

2467
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:18,450
I love you, say it back.

2468
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,410
I'm not gay.

2469
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:23,490
She didn't say it back.

2470
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:25,070
She didn't say it back.

2471
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:25,910
Damn.

2472
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:27,490
Damn.

2473
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:30,210
That's rough, buddy.

2474
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:32,890
It's fine, I'm used to Filian being mean to me.

2475
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:33,590
It's alright.

2476
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:34,810
Just roll!

2477
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:35,990
Oh, are you a masochist?

2478
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,990
Where everything is so fucked up here.

2479
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:39,910
Shy.

2480
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:40,650
Just roll!

2481
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:43,370
I'm figuring out what I wanna do.

2482
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:45,110
Oh, you take the...

2483
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,070
Oh, you should get the...

2484
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,610
Both of your stars!

2485
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:47,470
The...

2486
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:47,970
Yes.

2487
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:48,550
The chop...

2488
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:49,730
Yeah, I was gonna say, the chop hop.

2489
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,750
If it's any consolation, I think you're gonna win the game.

2490
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:53,990
Uh...

2491
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:54,370
Oh, really?

2492
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,310
Can you explain how in, uh, under ten words?

2493
01:10:58,830 --> 01:10:59,690
Pure luck.

2494
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:03,270
This Mario Party is never fair.

2495
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:06,050
The heart of the cards, baby.

2496
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:07,330
Yay.

2497
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:10,210
I put like half the minigames, bro.

2498
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,570
I don't have any money.

2499
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,230
Wait, what's the blue thing?

2500
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:19,630
The blue door.

2501
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:22,790
The mirror, it swaps places with another person.

2502
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:24,850
That could be good.

2503
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:25,450
That same skill.

2504
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,630
Chance time.

2505
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:33,110
Wait, why would I step on that?

2506
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:34,310
You can get coins.

2507
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:35,570
You can get coins from people.

2508
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:37,790
So true.

2509
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:40,810
Remember that thing where I said about luck?

2510
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:41,690
Yeah.

2511
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:42,570
Yeah.

2512
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:44,290
No, wait, watch.

2513
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,170
I have control.

2514
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:45,710
This is it.

2515
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,490
Wait, really?

2516
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,170
What is it?

2517
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:49,230
Is it a star?

2518
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,150
You might be able to get two stars back.

2519
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:51,890
Yeah.

2520
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,730
That's how I lost the game.

2521
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:54,030
I'm so excited.

2522
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:54,610
Yeah.

2523
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:57,450
No.

2524
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:58,210
Wait.

2525
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,130
Wait.

2526
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:01,910
Who wants my 10?

2527
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,790
Can I help them, please?

2528
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:05,950
Can I have coins?

2529
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:06,310
Yes, you can.

2530
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:07,270
Oh, my God.

2531
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,330
You gave me 10 coins.

2532
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:09,970
Thank you.

2533
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:10,130
Thank you.

2534
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:14,230
This is where it all starts.

2535
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:18,470
Bro, this is my comeback story.

2536
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,970
I filed for bankruptcy and then I get a loan of a bill.

2537
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:21,430
I told you.

2538
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,490
Thank you.

2539
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:23,030
You know what, Zed?

2540
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:23,750
You will believe me when no one else did.

2541
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:24,530
I fucking told you.

2542
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:25,910
You're my day one, bro.

2543
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,890
You're my real one, okay?

2544
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:30,910
Didn't she just steal your star?

2545
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,170
Yeah, didn't she steal your star?

2546
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,310
Isn't that even worse?

2547
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:33,610
Don't.

2548
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:33,670
Hey.

2549
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:34,550
Hey.

2550
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,470
Something like that.

2551
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:36,190
You want to say that.

2552
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:40,270
I literally gave you money, and you're like, Zed, you're the real one.

2553
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,750
Yeah, I just gave you 10 coins.

2554
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:45,450
What the hell?

2555
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:46,670
All right.

2556
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:47,070
I'm ready.

2557
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,010
Mama Mia.

2558
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:49,890
All right, chat.

2559
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:50,430
You ready for this?

2560
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,330
They call this...

2561
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:52,830
Who can match fast?

2562
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:55,050
God, I need one of those, like, things that, like, constantly does stuff.

2563
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,990
I hate mashing!

2564
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,330
I'm so good at mashing!

2565
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:04,910
I'm still bad at mashing.

2566
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:07,390
But who are you talking to?

2567
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:07,850
That's not me too.

2568
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:08,570
Holy shit.

2569
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,150
Chat, I might not be a woman.

2570
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:10,490
Fuck.

2571
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:12,510
Oh, frick.

2572
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:16,550
Do they have my hands feel tired?

2573
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:20,250
Oh, never mind, it doesn't.

2574
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,110
What the fuck?

2575
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:23,430
Oh my god.

2576
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,670
I feel so slow today, though.

2577
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:26,630
Jesus.

2578
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:28,070
You've been practicing.

2579
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,650
I'm the worst masher.

2580
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:35,450
My reaction time is very slow today, though, today.

2581
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:36,210
For sure.

2582
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:37,310
Maybe you don't jerk it enough.

2583
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:38,530
Oh.

2584
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:39,830
Yeah, see, chat?

2585
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:40,690
I'm not a goer.

2586
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:41,290
See?

2587
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,250
You know what?

2588
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:42,950
I take that W.

2589
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,210
You're bad at masters.

2590
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,710
You're bad with your fingers.

2591
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:47,970
I've got money.

2592
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,570
Yeah, that's why I'm single.

2593
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:53,290
Homestretch.

2594
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:54,190
Homestretch.

2595
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,790
Wait, how many turns?

2596
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,150
Wait, was this only ten turns?

2597
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:59,110
Wait a second.

2598
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:00,890
Aren't you just with Wario?

2599
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,890
I'm gonna get adopted?

2600
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:06,610
Guys, I think I'm in first place.

2601
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:09,610
What is this?

2602
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:11,990
It's homestretch.

2603
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:15,570
I wanna go home.

2604
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,810
Oh, they gave you a little bonus.

2605
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,610
Oh, I can pick an event?

2606
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,570
Can I, um...

2607
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:24,090
Can I get more stars?

2608
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:25,610
Oh, do Bowser spaces.

2609
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:27,070
That'll make it more fun.

2610
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:28,150
Okay.

2611
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:30,770
That is true.

2612
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,610
Oh.

2613
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:34,930
Yay.

2614
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:36,550
Well, this got worse.

2615
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:38,710
I like AIDS.

2616
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:39,510
Nice.

2617
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,470
Okay, so what happened when you went on a Bowser square?

2618
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:43,790
You died.

2619
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:44,930
Trying to find out.

2620
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:46,830
You fucking die.

2621
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,270
Jesus Christ.

2622
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:49,350
It's okay.

2623
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:51,730
It doesn't have stars, so it won't affect her as much.

2624
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:54,910
Yeah, well, you don't have...

2625
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:55,710
A brain.

2626
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:56,550
I don't know.

2627
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:57,250
I just tricked.

2628
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:58,830
I'm so bored.

2629
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:03,630
Are you guys gonna steal Wario from me?

2630
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,670
Millian, Wario is leaving in one turn.

2631
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:06,430
Yeah, you got it.

2632
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:07,430
I don't care.

2633
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:08,630
What?

2634
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:12,270
You got him and you didn't do anything with him.

2635
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:14,330
Why am I supposed to go with him?

2636
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:15,850
Oh, Millian.

2637
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,470
You could have used your double block.

2638
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:23,670
If you used your double block, you could have got two stars, Millian.

2639
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,150
Don't even call him.

2640
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:30,130
I don't think I'm gonna make it the star.

2641
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:31,990
Yeah, I knew it.

2642
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:32,790
Don't know.

2643
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:33,190
Don't know.

2644
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:33,790
I knew.

2645
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:34,370
I was not.

2646
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:35,550
I'm not lucky today.

2647
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:35,990
Oh.

2648
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:36,670
Hey.

2649
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,370
Whoa.

2650
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:38,270
Let's fight.

2651
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:39,430
Fight.

2652
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:40,650
Fight.

2653
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:41,050
Fight.

2654
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:41,490
Fight.

2655
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:42,810
All of them.

2656
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:43,410
All of them.

2657
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:44,010
You're right.

2658
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:44,830
All of them.

2659
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:45,590
This is the most.

2660
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:46,910
I have nothing to lose.

2661
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,530
You took my man, Doki.

2662
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,610
Wait, I don't even have him.

2663
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:50,970
Fight.

2664
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:51,330
Fight.

2665
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:52,830
Yeah, you literally stole him.

2666
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:53,330
Fight.

2667
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:56,450
I have nothing to lose.

2668
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:59,090
I'm fucking broke.

2669
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:02,890
All the marbles.

2670
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:03,530
Wait, what?

2671
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:04,290
Oh.

2672
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:05,610
This stupid one.

2673
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,630
This one is really funny.

2674
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,770
You can punch each other.

2675
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:10,430
Yeah.

2676
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:11,750
Stop punching.

2677
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:12,990
Marbles on screen.

2678
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:13,730
Oh my god.

2679
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:14,510
Worldstar.

2680
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:15,570
Worldstar.

2681
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:16,690
Worldstar.

2682
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:16,970
That's right.

2683
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:17,850
Worldstar.

2684
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:19,330
Let's fucking fight.

2685
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:20,150
Get out of here.

2686
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:21,670
Worldstar attack.

2687
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,170
Can you fight?

2688
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:22,630
Yeah.

2689
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,250
Alright, I figured it out.

2690
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,920
Alright, you gotta run straight and throw hands.

2691
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:32,720
Adios.

2692
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:33,000
Okay.

2693
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:34,020
Billion.

2694
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:34,860
What?

2695
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,720
You take...

2696
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,160
Wait, which side are you taking?

2697
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,240
What do you mean?

2698
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,600
No.

2699
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,960
Which side are you taking?

2700
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,160
We're gonna bet...

2701
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:44,080
I bet $100 that Zentreya's gonna win.

2702
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,320
I bet $100,000 she's gonna win.

2703
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,120
So you owe me $999,000.

2704
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,720
Yeah, i punched you out!

2705
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:50,200
I guessed.

2706
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,300
It doesn't work like that.

2707
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,780
Bro, punching was useless.

2708
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:54,680
I said it first.

2709
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,720
PUNCHING was useless.

2710
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,640
I was trying to punch her out of here.

2711
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,600
I didn't realize it.

2712
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,220
I just wanted to fight.

2713
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:03,700
Worldstar.

2714
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,680
You could be as smart at Zrender for this world.

2715
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,380
That's a rare opportunity.

2716
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,140
Oh, hey!

2717
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,600
Shut up, are you serious?

2718
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,960
Today's just not my day.

2719
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,640
Can somebody give me coins?

2720
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,200
Wait, do you get... I need coins.

2721
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,660
Oh, she gets Wario too.

2722
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:37,720
No.

2723
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,020
What does that do?

2724
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,080
You can take my shot, too.

2725
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:41,420
Oh.

2726
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:42,100
Wait, what is that?

2727
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,420
Is that bad?

2728
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,380
No, she gets to steal your stuff.

2729
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,420
Brother, I have nothing!

2730
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:51,060
What?!

2731
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:58,020
That is just really unfortunate.

2732
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,640
Zen, I'm already naked.

2733
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,640
Like, what else do you want?

2734
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,600
I'm sorry.

2735
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,460
You've taken everything from me.

2736
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,680
Just don't hit her one.

2737
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,000
Okay.

2738
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,260
Oh my god, and she gets the double stuff.

2739
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:08,900
Oh wait, she doesn't.

2740
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:09,520
She's not a one.

2741
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:11,280
She gets another star.

2742
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,280
Wait, you're winning!

2743
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:15,620
Shout out my codes.

2744
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,620
Who's closest to 50 dollars?

2745
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,600
None of us.

2746
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,820
You got a star!

2747
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,040
You're a star.

2748
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,880
She's rich gets richer.

2749
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,540
No wonder Zen suggested Mario Party.

2750
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,280
Forgot the might of the entire world against me.

2751
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:34,600
What else to do?

2752
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,740
Of course she suggested it.

2753
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,740
It seems we've been set up.

2754
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,920
Seems we've been set up to make her look good.

2755
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,180
I would never.

2756
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:47,120
This is the same type of vibe when you're first asked for karaoke and you know they're cracked at it.

2757
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:47,400
I shouldn't.

2758
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,260
Yeah, I shouldn't have fixed my game capture.

2759
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,380
What if I... I just have gotten my ass beats continuously.

2760
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,480
End this game.

2761
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,660
How many jamborees have you played?

2762
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:59,400
Don't ask.

2763
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:00,400
Oh my god.

2764
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,320
We could look at our pro... I'm looking at our profile.

2765
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,260
I'm getting close.

2766
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:04,500
I'm looking.

2767
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,520
Yeah, check her stats.

2768
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:05,800
Check her stats.

2769
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,140
I'm checking her stats right now.

2770
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,300
He's on PEDs.

2771
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,720
Alright, I'm looking at her stats right now.

2772
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,240
Alright, friends.

2773
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:12,940
Oh wait, you can look.

2774
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:13,320
Yeah.

2775
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,700
You can look after the game too because you get like a Mario Party star.

2776
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:22,660
You played... You played 60 hours of Mario Party?

2777
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,140
Wait, how many hours have I played?

2778
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,600
All that just to lose to me.

2779
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,200
Wait, how many... You have 20 hours.

2780
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,800
Kill 60?

2781
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,000
Kill 60?

2782
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

2783
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,240
Zen has fucking 60.

2784
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,760
Wait, I don't have any fucking coins!

2785
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,900
Zen has 60 hours.

2786
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:39,420
Wait, how many hours do I have?

2787
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,920
I have four hours.

2788
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,140
How many do I have?

2789
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:48,460
You have... You have played for a little while, which means this is your first game.

2790
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:48,760
Are we about to fight for two coins?

2791
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,440
Fight for a little while.

2792
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,720
I can only wager two.

2793
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:53,680
No fuck, you have one there.

2794
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:54,540
Two whole ass coins.

2795
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,680
I have four hours on this game.

2796
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,020
Breaking the bank.

2797
01:19:59,100 --> 01:19:59,600
Yo.

2798
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,820
I'm gonna wager everything.

2799
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,980
Okay, so I need to take this really seriously.

2800
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,240
Okay, good job, Mario.

2801
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:08,620
You got it.

2802
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,540
She's trying to take your... If you let Zen win, she'll get the minigame.

2803
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:11,740
Yeah.

2804
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:12,680
Minigame star.

2805
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,100
Give me your lunch money.

2806
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,740
Wait, you're loving one of me for two bucks?

2807
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,380
Let's go!

2808
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:20,060
Oh, for... It's all I have.

2809
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:21,600
What's this?

2810
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:22,060
Oh.

2811
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,460
Move up and down?

2812
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:24,560
Yeah.

2813
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:26,280
Oh, wow.

2814
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,040
Ow.

2815
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,200
You get bumped down and you get hit.

2816
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,120
I bet.

2817
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:30,620
Let's get it.

2818
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,180
I bet.

2819
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:31,180
Let's get it.

2820
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:31,480
Alright, Marthy.

2821
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:31,820
Okay.

2822
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:32,840
You ready for this?

2823
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,780
You are against a real gamer.

2824
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:35,900
You are against a real gamer.

2825
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:36,840
You are against a real gamer right now.

2826
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,320
Damn, four whole coins.

2827
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,980
But I love Mario.

2828
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,820
So... Guys, you guys gotta get through the first part.

2829
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,160
The first thing.

2830
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:50,100
Brother!

2831
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:51,360
Go, go, go!

2832
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,900
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through.

2833
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,200
They see me, I'm up.

2834
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,060
Oh, the risk.

2835
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:58,220
Mother...

2836
01:20:58,940 --> 01:20:59,940
Risk it all.

2837
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:00,740
Dude, there's too much friction.

2838
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:01,840
Wow.

2839
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:03,760
Ow.

2840
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:04,040
Ow.

2841
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:04,620
Okay.

2842
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,100
I'm higher.

2843
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,260
I can see Billy and Brute forcing it.

2844
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,700
No, I'm not.

2845
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,640
Two whole fucking coins.

2846
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:14,720
I got your two coins.

2847
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,640
The most intense game I've ever seen.

2848
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,240
I got your coins.

2849
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,980
I got your coins.

2850
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:27,980
Yippee.

2851
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,400
Yippee.

2852
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:34,220
You took my... I mean, she was never gonna play this game again.

2853
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:35,860
You took my last dollar.

2854
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,260
Bro, you have, like, $40.

2855
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,920
You took my last dollar.

2856
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,460
And you can't refund a game within two hours, dude.

2857
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,380
Who took my last dollar?

2858
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:46,120
And now I'm gonna stop.

2859
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:46,560
Bro, it's Nintendo.

2860
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:47,700
You probably can't refund it anyway.

2861
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,820
Yeah, that's exactly.

2862
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:51,820
Mini game time.

2863
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,200
No, refund it.

2864
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,420
We need to play again on another day to see.

2865
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,240
And we need to figure out who's a bitch.

2866
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,740
We need to get 60 hours, like Zen.

2867
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,060
We need to play Monopoly next time.

2868
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:02,640
Come on, guys.

2869
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:03,280
Monopoly.

2870
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:04,700
Yeah, that game's way cooler.

2871
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:05,940
I hate Monopoly.

2872
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:07,080
All right, all right.

2873
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:07,520
You guys are haters.

2874
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:07,900
It's fine.

2875
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,240
Oh, I jumped.

2876
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,720
Oh, they have a lot of version on Steam, I found.

2877
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,680
Bro, so why are we not looking at the stars?

2878
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,620
We're looking at the rock.

2879
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:28,340
Oh, we can, like, body block each other.

2880
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,600
Just as I said that.

2881
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,520
Just as I said that.

2882
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:35,420
I'm falling apart.

2883
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,460
I'm so sorry.

2884
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:37,820
I'm falling apart.

2885
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:38,180
Don't let me die.

2886
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,060
Don't let me die.

2887
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,500
Don't let us die, guys.

2888
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,380
We're all friends.

2889
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,880
We're all friends.

2890
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,600
Why can't we be friends?

2891
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,480
Why can't we be friends?

2892
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,160
Why can't we be friends?

2893
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,900
It's okay, the comebacks are gonna go crazy.

2894
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:54,720
Why can't we be friends?

2895
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,160
We don't have any time for a comeback.

2896
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,160
Yes, we do.

2897
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,160
Friendship.

2898
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:00,540
Yay!

2899
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,400
So much friendship.

2900
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:03,940
We're so close.

2901
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:07,000
Wow, look it, we have no personal space.

2902
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,500
At all.

2903
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:09,860
Don't need stars.

2904
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,720
What is personal space, Zen?

2905
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:13,980
That world's really big.

2906
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:14,640
Yay!

2907
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:16,160
Wow.

2908
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,260
Holy frick.

2909
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:19,500
Wait, there's only two turns left?

2910
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,220
Yeah.

2911
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:20,540
Yeah.

2912
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,960
Zen selected ten turns.

2913
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:23,820
It's over.

2914
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:24,280
It's over.

2915
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:24,960
I'm too tilted.

2916
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:25,820
Oh.

2917
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:26,020
Shit.

2918
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:26,380
My bad.

2919
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,160
Philly and those bonus stars, though.

2920
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,440
Yeah, for what?

2921
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:30,660
Getting gangbang?

2922
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:31,640
Like...

2923
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,080
Why would you say that?

2924
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:33,960
Actually, yes.

2925
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:34,540
Wait.

2926
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:35,820
Wait, really?

2927
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:41,780
Isn't there a star more of the most red spaces landed on?

2928
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:42,800
Hi, Mario.

2929
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,080
Mario.

2930
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:44,380
Technically.

2931
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:44,900
Wait.

2932
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,520
Wait, there's a star for Misfortune?

2933
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:47,460
Yeah.

2934
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:48,540
Yeah.

2935
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:48,860
Yeah.

2936
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:48,980
Holy frick.

2937
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,200
No, I'm pretty sure.

2938
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:50,740
We're back.

2939
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:52,360
I don't know what this thing does.

2940
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:52,920
I'm using it.

2941
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,180
What's that thing get it?

2942
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,360
Well, sometimes there's a star for Misfortune.

2943
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:57,800
She's believing.

2944
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,700
There's a star for minigames, Misfortune, and...

2945
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,000
Watch this.

2946
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:02,140
Ten!

2947
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:02,860
Luckiest.

2948
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,540
Is there still a sticker stock?

2949
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,120
Yeah, there is.

2950
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,160
Awesome.

2951
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,400
Ooh, land on the Bowser's face.

2952
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,360
Oh, if I go forward, I can get a Bowser.

2953
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,380
If I go south, I can get an item.

2954
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,180
I believe.

2955
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,860
Bowser is.

2956
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,760
Why would I feel bad for you and give you money?

2957
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:21,900
Oh, that's true.

2958
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:25,120
If you're broke, you can get money.

2959
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:27,660
Can I 1v1 someone for both of their stars?

2960
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:28,940
Not in particular, of course.

2961
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:30,060
Huh?

2962
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:30,720
What is it?

2963
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:31,580
Pair up the item you want?

2964
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:32,420
Talk too fast.

2965
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,100
What did you say?

2966
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:33,400
You got this.

2967
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,560
He wants the 1v1 to get stars.

2968
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:36,760
Oh.

2969
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,300
What am I doing?

2970
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,560
I only memorized, like, two items, so I'm just gonna have to...

2971
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,300
I only memorized this, so I'm just gonna do that.

2972
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:45,800
Okay.

2973
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,140
I mean, that's the best one.

2974
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:47,600
That's a good item.

2975
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,400
It is?

2976
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,560
That's the best item there.

2977
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,340
Yeah, it's three dice blocks.

2978
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,140
Okay, okay, okay.

2979
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,080
Yeah, that's the only one I memorized.

2980
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:55,920
Let's have me get it.

2981
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:56,560
Okay.

2982
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,660
Wait, so, can you guys steal that?

2983
01:24:58,820 --> 01:24:59,620
You guys would never, right?

2984
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,780
We can steal anything we want.

2985
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,660
I won't.

2986
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:03,320
I promise.

2987
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:04,460
Thank you.

2988
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,600
Wait, where is the...

2989
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,040
next star?

2990
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:09,840
How do we?

2991
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,260
How do we get that?

2992
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,080
Oh!

2993
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:13,780
Congrats!

2994
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:14,940
That's how we get it.

2995
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:15,740
I moved it.

2996
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,120
Okay.

2997
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:16,920
You did it!

2998
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,780
Yeah, you did.

2999
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:20,900
Yes.

3000
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:21,960
Yes!

3001
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,000
Yes!

3002
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,260
Yes!

3003
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:25,660
Yes!

3004
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:27,900
Yes!

3005
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:28,660
Yes!

3006
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:28,800
Yes!

3007
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:29,180
Yes!

3008
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,740
What you did there?

3009
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,020
I'm going back home, guys.

3010
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:35,220
Wait, why are you over there now?

3011
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:35,800
Okay, not here.

3012
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:36,320
I...

3013
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:36,460
What?

3014
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,800
There's a shop here?

3015
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,280
Wait, you...

3016
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,120
Did you lose money?

3017
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,400
No, no, I get...

3018
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,900
I get closer to the...

3019
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,260
Oh!

3020
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:44,600
Wow!

3021
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:45,460
Yeah.

3022
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,760
Wait, that's a wooden group.

3023
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,920
She's a genius.

3024
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,940
He's got a hole where his nuts are.

3025
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:53,600
I'm gonna grab this.

3026
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:54,220
What?

3027
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:54,900
The Goomba.

3028
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,200
There's a wooden Goomba with a door.

3029
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:57,720
What?

3030
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,060
The door where his nuts are?

3031
01:25:59,560 --> 01:25:59,920
Yes!

3032
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:00,900
Where?

3033
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,540
In the background?

3034
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,420
It's like in the above Doki, you know what I'm saying?

3035
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,020
If I can't win, I'll just creep.

3036
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:06,060
Yeah, you see?

3037
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:06,380
Look at that.

3038
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,680
Freak you out, Goomba.

3039
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:08,240
You saw that jump?

3040
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:09,840
Oh, hey.

3041
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,780
That's a female, Goomba.

3042
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,980
That's just his...

3043
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:13,700
Oh.

3044
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:14,120
Oh, right.

3045
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:14,380
Hussein.

3046
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,500
Where's the most money?

3047
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:15,820
Not it.

3048
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,020
Okay, so...

3049
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:18,520
No, brother.

3050
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,320
I...

3051
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,080
Yes, I...

3052
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,640
You are my...

3053
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,420
Abba.

3054
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:23,780
You...

3055
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:29,100
You are a tower defense unit that exists to bully me!

3056
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:29,920
What do you mean?

3057
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:32,780
I literally said who I was just taking was the most money.

3058
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:33,900
Oh, I got a match!

3059
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,960
Shouldn't have been rich, I guess.

3060
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:36,640
No!

3061
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,180
Shouldn't have been rich.

3062
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,000
Yay, money!

3063
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,300
I want money!

3064
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:44,940
Yeah.

3065
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,140
We are want money.

3066
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:47,440
This economy is fucking rough.

3067
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,200
Sigh.

3068
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:52,880
Yay!

3069
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,600
100 coins sure would be nice right now.

3070
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,080
Yeah, it would be pretty.

3071
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:02,460
Cool.

3072
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,900
You should do the double dice, I might as well.

3073
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:08,540
Let's get closer to the staff.

3074
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:09,060
What is the ticket?

3075
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:09,400
You can do something.

3076
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,840
Um, it's plus five.

3077
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:10,860
That is true.

3078
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,500
I see why Thillion doesn't do multiplayer games much, LaMal.

3079
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,260
It hurts.

3080
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,520
I understand your pain.

3081
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,100
Ted!

3082
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:26,900
Now you're ten blocks closer.

3083
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,540
Can you come down here with me?

3084
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:30,320
Let's hang out.

3085
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,260
Let's see.

3086
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,660
You might be able to take the train and get closer to the star.

3087
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:41,320
Aww.

3088
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:42,920
I'll miss you.

3089
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,340
Fair enough.

3090
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,920
I'll come back.

3091
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,100
Don't worry.

3092
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,220
I'll catch up.

3093
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,000
Go away.

3094
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,590
Oh, you just left.

3095
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:59,250
You really just said I'll come back and you got on the train.

3096
01:27:59,490 --> 01:27:59,910
What?

3097
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,990
I mean, she could come back still.

3098
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:06,390
Whoa.

3099
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:08,030
Who stops?

3100
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:09,870
I'm coming back.

3101
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:10,870
Ah!

3102
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,150
Sneakle core.

3103
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:15,150
Oh, where did I go?

3104
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:18,930
Oh my god, that was a hit and run!

3105
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,230
Wait, are you actually right behind me?

3106
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:24,290
Wait, are you actually right behind me?

3107
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:25,710
Haha, wait!

3108
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:26,650
That's gonna actually get tough!

3109
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:28,070
Told you.

3110
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:29,810
Can you 1v1 me?

3111
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:30,990
I gotta hit and run!

3112
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:32,350
Did anyone get the license plate?

3113
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:33,010
Okay.

3114
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:37,090
How does it work?

3115
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:37,790
Oh.

3116
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:38,630
Just drop it.

3117
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:39,510
Okay.

3118
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:42,770
I need it.

3119
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:43,910
It's pretty easy.

3120
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:47,730
You have to say Plinko after it lands.

3121
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:48,530
Plinko.

3122
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:49,630
Oh!

3123
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:51,290
What did the Maddie mirror do?

3124
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:52,630
Plinko!

3125
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:54,910
It lets you trade spots with people.

3126
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:56,050
Oh.

3127
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:57,830
You got an item.

3128
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:00,630
Yeah, whoever's closest is a star.

3129
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:01,570
You can trade with them.

3130
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:02,290
Pickle?

3131
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:02,530
Wait.

3132
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:04,190
Chat, where is the next star at?

3133
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:05,090
Pickle Rig.

3134
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:06,550
I don't think anyone knows right now.

3135
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:08,390
That's the funniest shit I've ever heard.

3136
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:11,730
You gotta have a high IQ to understand that joke.

3137
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:13,990
Where's the star?

3138
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:14,890
Pickle Rig!

3139
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:17,130
Yeah, my entire chat just spammed Pickle Rig now.

3140
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:18,810
Uh...

3141
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:19,950
You have a very smart chat.

3142
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:21,970
You're triggering the hive mind.

3143
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:22,430
That makes sense.

3144
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:23,190
Yeah, chat, we're smart, right?

3145
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,490
Where did I wanna go?

3146
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:29,950
Mai, where's the star?

3147
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:32,790
Um, it's behind us.

3148
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:33,870
It's right here.

3149
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:35,230
Congrats.

3150
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:37,950
It's behind you?

3151
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,630
It's behind both of us, bro.

3152
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:41,650
Wow!

3153
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:48,170
Call one player over for 10 coins.

3154
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:50,430
Ooh, I want coins.

3155
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:52,050
Wait, no.

3156
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:53,370
Doesn't it cost you 10 coins?

3157
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:53,830
Wait a sec.

3158
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,090
Don't.

3159
01:29:59,090 --> 01:29:59,830
Don't.

3160
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:00,950
Is it a good idea?

3161
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:03,050
Call everybody.

3162
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:03,770
Yes.

3163
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:05,150
Yay!

3164
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:07,090
Let's all have a party!

3165
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,890
Let's call everybody in one spot!

3166
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:10,030
No.

3167
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:11,390
No.

3168
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,130
No.

3169
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,830
Wait, you took the train, you could have got first here.

3170
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:17,710
Wait, maybe that could have been smarter idea.

3171
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:18,390
Let's get some drinks.

3172
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:19,430
Yay!

3173
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:23,450
Break time.

3174
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:25,510
The milk saloon.

3175
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:26,470
The milk saloon.

3176
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:27,270
Invite one.

3177
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,810
What does that do?

3178
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:28,170
Invite one.

3179
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:30,150
What happened?

3180
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:32,810
Oh, it invites somebody randomly.

3181
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:34,090
No!

3182
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:35,030
I wanna choose!

3183
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:37,590
Can you invite me to your Xbox?

3184
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:39,330
Who do you pick?

3185
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:41,930
Come on over.

3186
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:42,370
Oh!

3187
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:44,550
You brought Zen over!

3188
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:46,010
Hi!

3189
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:47,230
Hi Zen!

3190
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:47,510
Hi Zen!

3191
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:47,970
I told you.

3192
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:48,890
You walked the whole round.

3193
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:51,130
You need the light off the middle.

3194
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:52,830
Bro, she walked like 10 spaces.

3195
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:54,010
She's tired.

3196
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:55,370
Let her have some rest.

3197
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:56,190
Sorry.

3198
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:56,650
Had too much.

3199
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:57,850
Oh my god, it's like a date.

3200
01:30:58,630 --> 01:30:59,610
That's the good stuff.

3201
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:00,990
Wait, what?

3202
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:01,630
What happened?

3203
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:02,990
You just brought her over.

3204
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:03,530
What?

3205
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:06,110
You just made me waste 10 coins!

3206
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:06,990
Yeah.

3207
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:08,070
Yeah, it's a date.

3208
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:12,250
Well, did you have a good time?

3209
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:12,850
You for the free drink.

3210
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:14,730
Oh, it's money.

3211
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:19,010
I feel like you should've paid because you make more than me.

3212
01:31:19,690 --> 01:31:20,170
Walk and check.

3213
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:21,810
What do I do?

3214
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:23,110
Oh, it's just...

3215
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:26,530
You'll get me next time though, right?

3216
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:27,630
Oh, I'm running to a wall.

3217
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:28,070
Yes.

3218
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:29,850
I got you.

3219
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:31,550
Thanks, buddy.

3220
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:37,670
Well, this one at least can get your money back.

3221
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:38,830
Yay.

3222
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:40,170
Here we go.

3223
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:40,750
Here we go.

3224
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:41,070
Here we go.

3225
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:44,730
I got gone so bad.

3226
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,170
Everybody be cool.

3227
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:49,870
Let's all share the coins.

3228
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:51,690
I get it because we're on ice.

3229
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:52,110
Yeah.

3230
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:53,290
Be cool.

3231
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:54,310
True.

3232
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:54,790
Oh no.

3233
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:55,670
That is so funny.

3234
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:56,210
Stop.

3235
01:31:56,630 --> 01:31:57,230
Stop.

3236
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:58,070
I got hit.

3237
01:31:58,670 --> 01:32:00,890
You are a money stealer.

3238
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:04,490
She does need the money.

3239
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:07,510
Look, she's been through a lot.

3240
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:08,750
Everybody be cool.

3241
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:09,950
Look at the controls.

3242
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:11,090
You be cool.

3243
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:11,950
Chill.

3244
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:13,790
Fuck.

3245
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:16,930
My money.

3246
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:19,110
What do you mean your money?

3247
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,310
You stole mine.

3248
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:20,990
We're rich.

3249
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:27,290
I kept trying to steer left and right because of racing games.

3250
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:27,690
I deserve that coin.

3251
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:30,590
Where did I go?

3252
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:31,550
I'll get you back.

3253
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,850
Don't worry.

3254
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:34,210
I owe you.

3255
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:35,950
Ah, thanks.

3256
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,190
Clip it and ship it, everybody.

3257
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:40,770
Everybody wins.

3258
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:42,790
Oh, three turns left, guys.

3259
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:47,410
Don't fuck it up.

3260
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:48,770
Wait, so where?

3261
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:49,990
View board.

3262
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:51,270
Yes, I like to do that.

3263
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:51,690
Come on.

3264
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:51,950
Fill me in.

3265
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:55,730
Wait, the store's like 18 hours away from me.

3266
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:56,090
What?

3267
01:32:56,430 --> 01:32:57,970
You could do the chop chop call.

3268
01:32:58,290 --> 01:32:58,970
Oh, you don't have it.

3269
01:32:59,150 --> 01:32:59,350
Big number.

3270
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:00,330
Come on.

3271
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:00,870
Yeah, I'm broke.

3272
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:04,250
Wait, so if I buy a ticket, can I go down?

3273
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:04,970
Wait.

3274
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:05,530
Yeah.

3275
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:07,570
Don't do that.

3276
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,210
Yeah.

3277
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:08,930
Wait, why not?

3278
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:11,150
You have nothing to lose.

3279
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:12,530
I can't see the map.

3280
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:14,730
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

3281
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:16,330
I'm just going on the assumption.

3282
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:17,750
You have nothing to lose.

3283
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:19,610
Okay, here we go.

3284
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:20,450
Maybe.

3285
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:21,050
Big roll here.

3286
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:21,850
Big roll here.

3287
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:22,310
It's winnable.

3288
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:23,190
Big roll here.

3289
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:23,510
Big money.

3290
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:24,090
Big money.

3291
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,130
Big money.

3292
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:25,750
Stop.

3293
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:27,350
Grim, Grim.

3294
01:33:27,630 --> 01:33:28,070
Boom.

3295
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:30,510
Oh, that's a goal.

3296
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:32,130
Nice.

3297
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:33,070
That's not enough.

3298
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:33,930
That's not enough.

3299
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:34,590
I mean...

3300
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:35,530
Yeah, not that lucky.

3301
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:36,290
But you got a ticket.

3302
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:40,010
So, how do I buy one ticket?

3303
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:40,370
Yeah.

3304
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:41,550
I don't know.

3305
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:43,250
I don't know where I'm going.

3306
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:45,710
Wait, I think we're going on the train.

3307
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:46,290
So, you can get a train.

3308
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:47,370
You can get the train.

3309
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:48,230
Yeah.

3310
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:48,910
Okay.

3311
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:50,590
And the train will take you...

3312
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:52,550
It will take you anywhere you want.

3313
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:54,750
Well...

3314
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:57,670
Wait, don't hit me.

3315
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:59,270
I thought it was.

3316
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,190
Wait, did I kill you?

3317
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:02,890
No.

3318
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:03,430
I killed them?

3319
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,510
What?

3320
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,870
You know, you moved them closer to the star.

3321
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:08,530
Did anybody get that number?

3322
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:10,070
Wait.

3323
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:12,350
One stop or two stops?

3324
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:14,010
Where did this take me?

3325
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:16,710
I think you...

3326
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:17,170
How many stops?

3327
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:20,630
I'm pretty sure you put them closer to the star now.

3328
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:22,090
I don't know.

3329
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:22,710
I'm going to do one stop.

3330
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:23,330
We'll see what happens.

3331
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:25,550
You go backwards or forward?

3332
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:28,870
Wait, you can go backwards?

3333
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:29,530
Yeah.

3334
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:30,170
Forwards.

3335
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:31,610
Wait, I...

3336
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:32,470
Oh, okay, cool.

3337
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:32,590
Yes.

3338
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:33,110
That's where I want to go.

3339
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:34,010
Okay?

3340
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:36,090
I think this is going to the plan, right?

3341
01:34:37,390 --> 01:34:37,770
Fly to the left now.

3342
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:38,870
Fly to the right.

3343
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:38,970
Fly to the right.

3344
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:40,550
Oh, you're closer to the star.

3345
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:40,910
Yeah.

3346
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:42,710
Oh, the math worked!

3347
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:43,810
Oh, my frick.

3348
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:44,130
Wait.

3349
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:44,530
Okay.

3350
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:45,170
It's winnable.

3351
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:46,790
Alright, get me out of here.

3352
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:47,170
Alright.

3353
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:48,730
We're on our way.

3354
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,510
No, she needs 18.

3355
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:52,970
Wait, who's closest?

3356
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:55,490
What is this?

3357
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:55,970
Mushroom?

3358
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:56,790
Super creepy.

3359
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:58,770
Fillion is closest to the star.

3360
01:34:59,010 --> 01:34:59,270
Alright.

3361
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,790
Mate, this is her comeback.

3362
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:04,090
It's coming.

3363
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:04,650
I'm gonna buy this.

3364
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:05,290
What does it do?

3365
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:06,190
Plus five.

3366
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:08,370
Okay, I bought that.

3367
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,310
Okay, sick.

3368
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:12,030
Great.

3369
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:12,490
Okay.

3370
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:14,450
Go, Fillion, go!

3371
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:17,490
How close is she?

3372
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:17,950
I have to steal mine for myself.

3373
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:19,710
Yes.

3374
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:20,170
Oh.

3375
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:22,170
What happens here if you land on your own?

3376
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:22,570
I'm my only fan.

3377
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:25,410
Oh, he called the train closer.

3378
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:26,150
Oh.

3379
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:27,950
Oh, never mind.

3380
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:28,550
Yeah.

3381
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:30,510
It's just a train moving.

3382
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:31,630
Yeah.

3383
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:33,310
I thought it was gonna hit you.

3384
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:34,690
Wait, someone has a mirror!

3385
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:35,810
Is someone gonna kill me?

3386
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:36,810
Oh, no.

3387
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:39,230
Uh...

3388
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:42,150
Shirley's and Trey wouldn't swap places with you.

3389
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:43,510
I worked so hard, Zen.

3390
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:45,390
I spent 20 bucks to get there.

3391
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:46,510
I would not.

3392
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:47,350
I spent 20 bucks to get there.

3393
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:50,310
I spent 20 bucks to get there.

3394
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:50,510
Yeah.

3395
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:51,210
Oh.

3396
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:54,210
Wait, what's happening?

3397
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:56,770
The star is moving.

3398
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:57,550
Are you serious?

3399
01:35:57,630 --> 01:35:58,450
It went closer?

3400
01:35:59,610 --> 01:35:59,710
Oh.

3401
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:01,910
Oh.

3402
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:02,730
Oh.

3403
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:03,830
It is not my day.

3404
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:04,790
Don't mirror me.

3405
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:06,630
It is not my day.

3406
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:07,690
It is not my day.

3407
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:11,390
You're bribing the competition?

3408
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:14,470
It's just not meant to be.

3409
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:16,230
Not for...

3410
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:16,950
Not Doki day.

3411
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:18,610
All you have to do is ask nicely.

3412
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:20,250
Do we have any friends?

3413
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:21,110
And then I got you.

3414
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:22,290
It's not a Doki day today.

3415
01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:26,070
Okay.

3416
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:28,730
Thanks.

3417
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,810
But I still can use it though.

3418
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:31,730
Right?

3419
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:32,090
Oh.

3420
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:32,810
Sure.

3421
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:36,710
So here's the thing.

3422
01:36:37,110 --> 01:36:38,090
Then we were a team.

3423
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:39,410
You don't want me to be last days.

3424
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:40,990
Since you said don't swap with you.

3425
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:42,870
Yeah.

3426
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,070
I'm not swapping with you.

3427
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:44,710
Technically.

3428
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:46,450
I thought I'm talking to Elle from Death Note.

3429
01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:47,230
You're gonna kill me aren't you?

3430
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:47,890
But it's random.

3431
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:49,830
Ohhhh.

3432
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:50,350
I'm sorry.

3433
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:51,330
But it's random.

3434
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:55,170
Were you funny if you swapped with Mari?

3435
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:00,630
Aww.

3436
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:02,850
We were meant to be together.

3437
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:08,070
That's pretty funny.

3438
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:09,790
That's actually pretty funny.

3439
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,870
Best friends forever.

3440
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:14,130
So I'm getting places real fucking fast.

3441
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:18,130
The only way is to make sure Fillion doesn't get...

3442
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:18,230
Oh.

3443
01:37:19,110 --> 01:37:19,610
No.

3444
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:21,250
Are you shitting me?

3445
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:22,390
Huge.

3446
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,290
One fucking move.

3447
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:27,050
Mushroom.

3448
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:30,810
Why does your shotgun sound like that?

3449
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:31,610
I'm gonna get so high.

3450
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:34,850
Because he's that guy.

3451
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:36,110
Because he's that guy.

3452
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:36,530
He's that guy.

3453
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:36,810
Nah.

3454
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:37,230
You're not that bad.

3455
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:38,050
I don't got any items.

3456
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:40,010
I bet I'll roll a 10.

3457
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:42,710
I was close.

3458
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:45,730
You could get the...

3459
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:48,350
Oh, I was gonna say... Wait, so when did Zentraya get three effing stars?

3460
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:51,430
You could get the train, and then run over Fillion.

3461
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:54,590
No, Fillion's out of the way of the train.

3462
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:58,690
Yeah, it's over.

3463
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:00,410
I'm in last place.

3464
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:01,410
With you.

3465
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,630
Yeah, but I don't wanna be last.

3466
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:07,870
Wait, so you're telling me you're atop your A-F-A-F-A-F-A.

3467
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:09,170
I don't wanna be last.

3468
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:10,990
And you're playing not for first.

3469
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:12,310
You're playing to not be last?

3470
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:13,410
Yeah, not last.

3471
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:17,310
It's been my thing for years, not last.

3472
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:20,190
It's all about who I can make having a living hell.

3473
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:22,630
As long as I'm not last, I'm happy.

3474
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:24,110
Oh, I'm having a great time, don't worry about me.

3475
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:24,590
Exactly.

3476
01:38:26,350 --> 01:38:27,830
One again, off again.

3477
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:32,190
Wait, are we against Fillion?

3478
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:32,990
Yeah, we are.

3479
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:34,070
Wait, what's happening?

3480
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:35,730
Oh, I hate this game.

3481
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:38,150
Oh, this one's gonna be funny.

3482
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:39,290
I see.

3483
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:40,050
Oh, I can kill you guys!

3484
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:40,430
Yeah!

3485
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:41,650
Okay.

3486
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:43,910
Oh, come on.

3487
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:45,110
Wow!

3488
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:47,070
I'm so bad at this one.

3489
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:49,050
Yeah, okay, I figured.

3490
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:50,230
Die, die, die!

3491
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:50,410
It's okay.

3492
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:51,090
Carry.

3493
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:52,450
I'm bad at it.

3494
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:54,250
Alright, Mari, I believe in you, Mari.

3495
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:57,350
I believe in you to carry us all.

3496
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,750
I believe.

3497
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:09,450
I told you, I know Mari can do it.

3498
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:12,430
I just didn't wanna live anymore.

3499
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:21,330
I feel like the less people on the screen, the easier it is too.

3500
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:22,350
Oh shit!

3501
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:22,730
Nevermind.

3502
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:24,250
Let's go!

3503
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:29,930
I thought I could do it.

3504
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:31,870
But I jumped right on her.

3505
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:31,910
But I jumped right on her.

3506
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:33,630
That's the most happiest I've heard her all game.

3507
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:35,730
That's because she hates me.

3508
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:36,050
Yeah.

3509
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:37,670
Mari, I died so you can clutch.

3510
01:39:37,670 --> 01:39:38,490
What happened?

3511
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:41,090
I'm sorry, I got nervous.

3512
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:45,690
My palms started sweating, my knees got weak, and my arms got heavy.

3513
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:47,190
You're in the zone though.

3514
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:48,730
But what about mom's spaghetti?

3515
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:50,230
Right.

3516
01:39:50,870 --> 01:39:53,330
Well, that would make everything a little bit better.

3517
01:39:54,010 --> 01:39:54,510
Oh, hey!

3518
01:39:54,650 --> 01:39:54,850
Yoshi!

3519
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:57,450
Hi, Yoshi!

3520
01:39:57,870 --> 01:39:58,130
Hello.

3521
01:39:58,490 --> 01:39:58,730
That guy.

3522
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:01,270
Oh, you can see copy items.

3523
01:40:01,810 --> 01:40:02,510
He's so far away.

3524
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:04,610
I don't think any of us can even get it.

3525
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:07,030
No, I can't.

3526
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:08,370
We only have two turns.

3527
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:10,730
What does this do?

3528
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:12,510
Here's your plus five.

3529
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:13,930
That's plus tier dice roll.

3530
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:14,850
Do it.

3531
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:16,930
You have to do it to get your star.

3532
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:18,050
Wait, where's the star?

3533
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:18,950
Literally in front of you.

3534
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:20,170
The yellow thing.

3535
01:40:20,450 --> 01:40:21,270
Right in front of you.

3536
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:21,770
Oh, it's a yellow?

3537
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:23,570
Oh, wait, there's no way I lose this.

3538
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:24,610
Claim your star.

3539
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:28,230
I claim.

3540
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:28,870
It's what you deserve.

3541
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:30,830
Jump up superstar.

3542
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,670
I'm a man, I'm a man.

3543
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:34,050
And you do do.

3544
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:35,690
You're my double star.

3545
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:36,690
I'm a man.

3546
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:38,630
You didn't get a lot of buddies, Flo.

3547
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:41,390
You got a star.

3548
01:40:41,690 --> 01:40:42,770
That is a beautiful song.

3549
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:44,050
He's in an edit.

3550
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,390
Who?

3551
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:47,070
Yeah.

3552
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:47,410
Who?

3553
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:48,290
What?

3554
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:49,530
Who was in an edit?

3555
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:50,530
Yeah.

3556
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:51,890
What kind of edit?

3557
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:53,570
What do you mean he was in an edit?

3558
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,470
I don't know.

3559
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:55,790
Wait, that's next to us.

3560
01:40:56,410 --> 01:40:57,390
Oh, frick.

3561
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:01,450
Where am I?

3562
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:05,730
Give each other big kisses.

3563
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:06,230
Cinema.

3564
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:07,490
On the cheeks.

3565
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:09,250
Okay, there's no way.

3566
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:10,150
Cinema.

3567
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:12,150
Chat.

3568
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:15,050
Start hugging and kissing and touching.

3569
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:15,850
Wait, how many?

3570
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:18,490
Do I need?

3571
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:20,450
Okay, I can just get...

3572
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:21,350
Kiss a honey.

3573
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:24,030
You know what?

3574
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:25,270
I'll just grab nine.

3575
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:27,190
Is this a mode?

3576
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:28,910
Smile really big for me.

3577
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:30,970
And look in the mirror and call yourself Freddy.

3578
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:31,830
What mode is this?

3579
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:34,510
Me and y'all.

3580
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:36,070
Mods ban me and y'all.

3581
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:37,270
Let's just get nine.

3582
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:38,150
Is that more?

3583
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:38,690
Is that more?

3584
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:41,250
A little bit.

3585
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:41,990
Just a little.

3586
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:43,510
Don't go too crazy.

3587
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:44,190
Mods ban me and y'all.

3588
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:50,430
Yeah, I got a star too, guys.

3589
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:51,690
I'm part of the team.

3590
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:52,810
Everybody got a star.

3591
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:53,330
Who's that a mode?

3592
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:55,950
No, I'm part of the crew now.

3593
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:57,730
Mods, jerk it a little.

3594
01:41:58,230 --> 01:41:59,010
Okay, I got a turn.

3595
01:41:59,170 --> 01:41:59,550
I got a turn.

3596
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:02,870
Where's the next star?

3597
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:03,810
Why is that your mode?

3598
01:42:03,890 --> 01:42:04,450
Me and y'all.

3599
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:06,350
Wait, what is?

3600
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:07,910
Me and y'all.

3601
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:09,050
What is that?

3602
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:10,390
I don't know.

3603
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:11,390
It's like my entire...

3604
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:14,430
It's like 17 frogs kissing in a weird like, yeah.

3605
01:42:14,610 --> 01:42:14,770
What?

3606
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:16,890
I don't think we have it.

3607
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:17,170
I don't know.

3608
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:19,150
But I don't know which ones we have.

3609
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:19,650
Don't judge.

3610
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:20,390
Because, um...

3611
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:22,090
We listen.

3612
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:22,890
I only see text.

3613
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:23,550
We don't judge.

3614
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:24,350
Oh.

3615
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:26,990
We listen, we don't judge.

3616
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:28,590
Okay, who's going first?

3617
01:42:28,590 --> 01:42:29,390
Zen has an variant of it.

3618
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:31,210
Yeah.

3619
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:34,210
Is it worth it?

3620
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:34,790
God damn it.

3621
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,470
I forgot about mine.

3622
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:37,790
Yeah!

3623
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:40,610
Fuck it.

3624
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:42,750
Freaky ass motherfuckers.

3625
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:44,070
That's what I'm saying!

3626
01:42:45,950 --> 01:42:47,190
Freaky odd chat.

3627
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:49,870
Are they kissing?

3628
01:42:50,090 --> 01:42:50,250
Sorry.

3629
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:51,430
I forgot.

3630
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:52,990
I can't judge.

3631
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:54,810
Oh yeah.

3632
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:57,030
We listen and we don't judge.

3633
01:42:57,090 --> 01:42:57,110
My bad.

3634
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:57,930
No kink shaming.

3635
01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:00,310
Sorry.

3636
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:03,490
One time...

3637
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:06,010
When I was super tired...

3638
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:08,710
I put a frozen pizza in the oven...

3639
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:11,490
and I accidentally cooked it upside down...

3640
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:14,630
and a bunch of the cheese started melting off...

3641
01:43:14,630 --> 01:43:16,030
onto the bottom of the oven.

3642
01:43:16,770 --> 01:43:16,850
Yay!

3643
01:43:16,850 --> 01:43:18,070
And when I took it out...

3644
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:19,870
I didn't realize that it was upside down...

3645
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:21,930
and then I cut into it...

3646
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:23,930
and I said, this is a weird looking pizza...

3647
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:25,610
and I went to bed without eating it...

3648
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:27,590
and then when I woke up in the morning...

3649
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:29,850
I realized that I cooked it upside down.

3650
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:32,110
I feel like that's not tired...

3651
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:32,270
That's gotta be like...

3652
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:33,590
I like eating cold pizza.

3653
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:36,130
We listen and we don't judge.

3654
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:37,630
Okay, that's fair.

3655
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:38,850
That just sounds like depression.

3656
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:41,590
Sometimes...

3657
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:45,570
We listen and we don't judge.

3658
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:47,910
Help me.

3659
01:43:48,910 --> 01:43:50,170
Oh, you should...

3660
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:51,310
Wait!

3661
01:43:52,890 --> 01:43:53,570
What?

3662
01:43:57,810 --> 01:43:58,790
Big number.

3663
01:43:59,130 --> 01:43:59,730
Big number!

3664
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:00,470
Big number!

3665
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:00,630
Big number!

3666
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:02,590
Hey.

3667
01:44:06,730 --> 01:44:07,250
12.

3668
01:44:07,690 --> 01:44:09,030
Where will this take me?

3669
01:44:09,870 --> 01:44:11,270
Well, time to find out.

3670
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,990
I don't think any of...

3671
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:16,790
Yeah, none of us can reach the other star...

3672
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:17,410
Unless you...

3673
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:19,650
Uh...

3674
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:20,790
Get a triple block.

3675
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:22,650
No, you can't...

3676
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:24,030
You can Chomp Chomp call it...

3677
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:25,110
and hope for the best.

3678
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:27,350
I like this.

3679
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:28,490
Look, a horse!

3680
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:31,490
Oh, versus!

3681
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:34,890
Oh, again.

3682
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:37,250
Oh, you get one last item.

3683
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:41,030
So many items.

3684
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:44,490
Somebody admit something embarrassing so I don't feel so alone.

3685
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:47,470
Yeah.

3686
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:49,050
I microwave a salad.

3687
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:49,690
I spread my peanuts?

3688
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:50,770
Oh, true.

3689
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:51,790
What?

3690
01:44:52,630 --> 01:44:55,090
Oh, yours is much worse to keep going.

3691
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:56,590
Yeah, wait, wait.

3692
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:57,850
Wait, you microwave a salad?

3693
01:44:58,370 --> 01:44:58,910
Don't worry about it.

3694
01:44:59,070 --> 01:44:59,330
Don't worry about it.

3695
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:01,570
Wait, like, what was the mindset for that?

3696
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:05,130
Charity goal.

3697
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:06,490
Oh.

3698
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:08,050
Fucking nasty.

3699
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:10,350
You ate it?

3700
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:11,470
Wait, did you eat it?

3701
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:13,890
I'm so sorry I interrupted you.

3702
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:15,650
Fillion, please continue.

3703
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:16,510
No!

3704
01:45:16,670 --> 01:45:17,670
What about your peanuts?

3705
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:20,610
Uh...

3706
01:45:20,610 --> 01:45:26,190
Sometimes I microwave food and I forget it's in there so I go to bed, and then when I open the microwave next morning I get jump scared.

3707
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:26,610
Oh.

3708
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:28,230
That's what I've been saying!

3709
01:45:28,710 --> 01:45:28,830
Yeah.

3710
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:30,110
You know...

3711
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,670
I said that the other day.

3712
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:33,510
I don't know.

3713
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:35,650
I thought we heard something about peepees.

3714
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,050
Oh, 1v3!

3715
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:37,870
What about your peanuts?

3716
01:45:41,490 --> 01:45:42,310
Cage catch?

3717
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:43,090
Cage catch!

3718
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:44,790
Oh, it's 20 coins!

3719
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:46,710
I hope I win.

3720
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:48,990
That's a lot of money.

3721
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:49,190
Eh.

3722
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:51,110
Oh, it's this one.

3723
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,570
Me too.

3724
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:52,490
We have to catch it.

3725
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:54,230
Oh, this.

3726
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:55,910
Wait, are we working together?

3727
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:58,830
Yeah, I have to...

3728
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:02,750
Like, I have to be the one that presses the button.

3729
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:03,550
Oh!

3730
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:05,250
Oh, and then someone runs away from us.

3731
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:05,650
Oh!

3732
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:07,970
Yeah, guys, guys, guys, guys.

3733
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:09,070
Yeah, she's still a killer!

3734
01:46:09,370 --> 01:46:09,610
There we go.

3735
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:11,390
Alright, we got it.

3736
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:12,270
I hope I win.

3737
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:13,990
Alright, Mara, you better run!

3738
01:46:14,010 --> 01:46:16,430
Okay, guys, you guys have to tell me when to press it.

3739
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:18,030
We're coming on now!

3740
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:19,170
Today's my off day.

3741
01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:19,790
Okay.

3742
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:21,610
Kill her!

3743
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:21,990
Okay.

3744
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:23,090
Um, what?

3745
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:23,610
What?

3746
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:24,750
How?

3747
01:46:27,470 --> 01:46:28,350
Where was she?

3748
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:29,350
I don't have any money!

3749
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:31,590
You guys have to be easy on me!

3750
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:33,070
You're broken!

3751
01:46:33,490 --> 01:46:33,850
I don't...

3752
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:35,310
I can't feed my cat!

3753
01:46:35,310 --> 01:46:35,370
Wasn't my idea.

3754
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:38,550
Like, how did she TP out of the cage?

3755
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:39,890
That was...

3756
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:41,730
At the heart of the cards.

3757
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:43,050
Yay!

3758
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:46,350
It's the last turn, so it's like, what do we even do?

3759
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:48,090
Why am I on board, though?

3760
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:49,750
Because you don't have money.

3761
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:51,070
I am...

3762
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:52,670
I helped as much as everyone else did!

3763
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:56,530
You might still win.

3764
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:57,650
You never know.

3765
01:46:58,010 --> 01:46:58,890
Yes, last turn!

3766
01:46:59,310 --> 01:46:59,670
Okay, look around.

3767
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:00,650
Watch us, watch us, watch us.

3768
01:47:00,730 --> 01:47:01,090
Look around.

3769
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:01,990
How do I...

3770
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:02,370
What do I see?

3771
01:47:02,490 --> 01:47:02,830
Oh, God.

3772
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:03,250
Oh, God.

3773
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:03,830
Oh,

3774
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:08,430
it's on the other side of the planet.

3775
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:11,510
I don't think any of us are gonna catch up to Zen, though.

3776
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:15,270
You never know.

3777
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:18,430
What about the bonus stars?

3778
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:19,770
Oh, that's true.

3779
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:21,810
Yeah, but I think she won...

3780
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:23,930
It's either Fillion or Zen that won the most minigames.

3781
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:25,590
Fuck!

3782
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:26,450
It's definitely not me.

3783
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:28,830
You know...

3784
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:29,310
You know...

3785
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:30,490
Wait, I can just take a trip!

3786
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:30,990
Oh, yeah.

3787
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:33,310
You might be close.

3788
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:33,550
Yeah!

3789
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:34,350
If you take the train.

3790
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:36,210
Wait, so, let me see.

3791
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:37,330
I just gotta go, like, uh...

3792
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:37,450
Oh.

3793
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:39,770
Yeah, make sure you go forward.

3794
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:40,710
No.

3795
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:41,510
It's not...

3796
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:42,390
I can't get there.

3797
01:47:42,570 --> 01:47:43,170
It's over.

3798
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:44,450
No, it's not happening.

3799
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:45,230
No, I'm good.

3800
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:45,610
Okay.

3801
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:48,150
What'd we get?

3802
01:47:50,450 --> 01:47:51,150
What are the...

3803
01:47:51,150 --> 01:47:51,610
I'm gonna go here.

3804
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:54,290
Oh, you get to go on a...

3805
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:55,970
You get to go on a date.

3806
01:47:56,990 --> 01:47:57,230
Wait.

3807
01:47:58,230 --> 01:47:58,630
What?

3808
01:47:58,870 --> 01:47:59,610
Don't do it.

3809
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:01,050
What is happening?

3810
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:02,230
Bring me...

3811
01:48:02,230 --> 01:48:05,710
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3812
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:06,530
If I do this...

3813
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:07,890
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3814
01:48:08,290 --> 01:48:09,650
Then you guys are gonna win.

3815
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:11,390
And Zen Trey is reverse...

3816
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:13,510
No, Zen's leaving.

3817
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:14,470
Fuck you.

3818
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:14,510
I'm on you.

3819
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:15,370
I'm on you.

3820
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:16,170
Exactly what she said.

3821
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:17,430
I'm on you guys.

3822
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:19,790
You're playing me for a fool.

3823
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:22,250
Girl.

3824
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:23,490
Thank God she didn't do it.

3825
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:24,410
I think you are so smart.

3826
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:25,990
Girl.

3827
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:29,070
Thank you.

3828
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:30,270
Yeah!

3829
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:32,690
Golden balls.

3830
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:35,110
She's saying you're smart, because...

3831
01:48:36,110 --> 01:48:37,430
Because you fucked up.

3832
01:48:37,670 --> 01:48:40,170
Yeah, you fucked up hard.

3833
01:48:40,490 --> 01:48:40,710
You fucked up.

3834
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:42,530
Explain what I fricked up!

3835
01:48:43,270 --> 01:48:44,750
You'll understand soon.

3836
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:49,710
Oh, I was just saying you were genuinely smart.

3837
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:51,310
Thank you.

3838
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:53,270
Oh, no.

3839
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:54,390
Don't...

3840
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:56,110
Also, nothing.

3841
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:56,870
Okay, so I...

3842
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:58,150
What?!

3843
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:03,920
As long as I'm not last...

3844
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:04,440
Eloy!

3845
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:14,060
Game 3 will tell a different story, dookie bird!

3846
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,920
As long as I'm not last...

3847
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:17,200
You son of a awful frick!

3848
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,680
Bro, I'm getting canned!

3849
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,940
I'm getting swapped canned!

3850
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,880
I wanna swap servers!

3851
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:32,560
I'll do everything I can to not be last!

3852
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:33,420
What the hell?

3853
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:35,720
Yippee!

3854
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,420
I respect it, honestly.

3855
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,940
One stop.

3856
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:43,460
Yeah!

3857
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:45,440
You know what's funny?

3858
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:49,060
Doki, you are the main person I am finding this one.

3859
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:52,520
Even if I take it from Zen, there's no point.

3860
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:59,120
I just want to guarantee my placement.

3861
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:03,100
And you hit her with the chain?

3862
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:07,960
I actually had just did everything.

3863
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:11,080
And I get Yoshi, too.

3864
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:11,700
Hey, Yoshi.

3865
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:14,880
If you stole from Zen, you would literally be in first place.

3866
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,180
Yippee.

3867
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,460
No, I don't have enough money to be first place.

3868
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:26,140
This is an extreme level of petty.

3869
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,180
Oh, this one.

3870
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,380
Wait, does it even matter who gets Yoshi in this point?

3871
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:30,700
No, it doesn't.

3872
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,060
She's just there.

3873
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:38,440
I might matter for Mirrors and Treya because we have one turn left.

3874
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:39,380
Oh, that's true.

3875
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:39,940
Yeah.

3876
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:40,720
Yeah.

3877
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:43,800
So maybe both of you guys can just throw.

3878
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:43,940
Oh.

3879
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:47,420
I would like to personally apologize for this game.

3880
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:49,720
What is this?

3881
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,800
It's pretty bad.

3882
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:55,420
Oh, this is the one where you run.

3883
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:56,960
Oh.

3884
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:58,200
How do you eat?

3885
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,440
Okay, I probably understand.

3886
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:01,340
How are you guys eating food?

3887
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,280
You just have to walk up to it.

3888
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:05,000
Oh, I'm an idiot, I guess.

3889
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:07,520
So are we trying to eat as much food as possible?

3890
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:07,980
Is that a game?

3891
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:08,520
Yeah.

3892
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:10,520
Wait, that's not an advantage.

3893
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,780
My teammate- You guys can just take it from me.

3894
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:13,580
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3895
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:17,060
This is- Wait, how is she so- Wait, how is she fast?

3896
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:18,880
Oh, it's the advantage, I guess?

3897
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,120
Yeah, it's my advantage.

3898
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:21,740
Oh.

3899
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,100
Wait.

3900
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:26,960
Wait, there's a shortcut?

3901
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:30,320
Okay, this basically shows Zen played 60 hours of this.

3902
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:36,880
Like, I can tell that she played 60 hours of Mario Party.

3903
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:41,960
She even played 60 hours of this.

3904
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:44,760
I was like, how the fuck did she know the shortcuts?

3905
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:47,200
Because I really fucking hate myself.

3906
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:48,400
Oh.

3907
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:50,180
What are the apples?

3908
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,100
They're the speed moves.

3909
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:53,520
They're not called apples, bro.

3910
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:54,600
What are they called?

3911
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:55,060
Oh.

3912
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:55,680
Oh.

3913
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:56,260
No.

3914
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:59,140
Wait, so are we trying to get to the end?

3915
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:00,580
Wait, they'll just speed you up.

3916
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:00,900
Yeah.

3917
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:02,180
I thought you looked like them up.

3918
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:04,740
These Zen and her stupid shortcuts.

3919
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,100
Slow down.

3920
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:06,940
Wait, can you guys slow down, please?

3921
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:07,880
Oh my god!

3922
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:08,340
No!

3923
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:09,180
Oh.

3924
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:12,780
I need to win, so that I can get the creature.

3925
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:17,440
Oh my god.

3926
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:19,340
Oh my god, what the fuck?

3927
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:20,760
You're just like...

3928
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:22,620
Goodbye, Zen.

3929
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:23,040
Hold up, Susan.

3930
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:24,100
It's okay.

3931
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,060
Now Zen has Yoshi.

3932
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:27,100
How is she so fast?

3933
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:30,080
Because she does 60 hours of Mario Party!

3934
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:30,520
Stop.

3935
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:31,740
She knows all the...

3936
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:33,500
She literally knows all the shortcuts!

3937
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:34,020
Stop her!

3938
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:34,920
Don't leave her!

3939
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:35,820
Stop her!

3940
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,740
I'm trying!

3941
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:40,040
How do I stop someone with 60 hours?

3942
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:40,720
Wait.

3943
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,040
No.

3944
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,000
Wait.

3945
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:45,880
Wait.

3946
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:46,220
I'll come back.

3947
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:46,480
I'll come back.

3948
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:48,020
How the fuck do I get up?

3949
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:49,620
What?

3950
01:52:49,740 --> 01:52:50,220
Oh!

3951
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:50,320
Oh!

3952
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:50,680
Oh!

3953
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:51,420
Baby!

3954
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:52,740
Oh my god.

3955
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:54,460
Oh my god.

3956
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,420
Don't call it a comeback.

3957
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,340
I don't know my map knowledge.

3958
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:00,840
I have no idea about map knowledge.

3959
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:05,600
I'm not the one.

3960
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I'm not the one.

3961
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,520
I'm not the one when I do.

3962
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,020
Oh god.

3963
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:13,880
I got so confused.

3964
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:14,740
Fuck.

3965
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,820
Who, who, who, who, who?

3966
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,000
Like, I can't make it.

3967
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,200
I was like, Yoshi, why can't you jump high?

3968
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:23,120
Good game.

3969
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:24,460
Holy shit.

3970
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,460
Good game.

3971
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:26,820
Jesus.

3972
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,860
Now Mario has Yoshi.

3973
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:29,940
Wait.

3974
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:30,480
Oh wait!

3975
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:32,660
And Zen can't steal Yoshi because...

3976
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:32,800
Wait!

3977
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:33,940
Yoshi's an ally?!

3978
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:36,840
Zen can't steal Yoshi too.

3979
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:40,520
Is superpowers helping you evade taxes.

3980
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:41,340
Yay.

3981
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:42,240
Money!

3982
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:45,400
Well, it's a good thing I was about to win the game.

3983
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:45,900
Hooray.

3984
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:47,280
No IRS.

3985
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:58,170
Jillian, I didn't see you that entire game.

3986
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:01,210
Yeah, the final goal was to collect apples.

3987
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:04,550
So I was, like, staying in the back waiting for them to respawn.

3988
01:54:04,810 --> 01:54:05,310
Wait, what?

3989
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:06,390
Amazing number.

3990
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:09,390
Oh, you didn't realize it was a race?

3991
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:12,070
I thought you won the most apples.

3992
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:13,190
I heard someone say that.

3993
01:54:13,290 --> 01:54:13,810
I'm like, okay, cool.

3994
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:14,230
I'll get apples.

3995
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:14,790
Oh, you got one guide.

3996
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:16,550
It sounds like they're not apples, Billion.

3997
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:18,030
Billion shot one guide.

3998
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:19,350
I know I got one girl.

3999
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:20,270
There's one of you freaks.

4000
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:24,370
Open.

4001
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:26,910
Yay.

4002
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:29,210
Open sesame.

4003
01:54:29,650 --> 01:54:30,970
Yay, coins.

4004
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:34,250
I think Zen got the most coins, too.

4005
01:54:34,270 --> 01:54:36,790
I hope that Yoshi gives me a free star.

4006
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:39,530
You have one turn.

4007
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:40,570
It might be a possibility.

4008
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:42,870
Please.

4009
01:54:43,690 --> 01:54:44,410
Please.

4010
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:51,610
You start with one and you end on one.

4011
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:54,530
Oh, money!

4012
01:54:55,190 --> 01:54:55,370
Yes.

4013
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:55,610
Okay.

4014
01:55:07,530 --> 01:55:08,110
Nice.

4015
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:08,610
I did.

4016
01:55:08,830 --> 01:55:10,510
In the end, I did get 20.

4017
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:12,450
No more.

4018
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:14,090
Last minigame.

4019
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:19,670
I hope I get two bonus stars and win the game.

4020
01:55:20,530 --> 01:55:22,710
Excuse me.

4021
01:55:23,110 --> 01:55:24,690
That is a big possibility.

4022
01:55:25,870 --> 01:55:27,710
You could get the minigame.

4023
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:29,910
I think the minigame bonus is between you or Zen.

4024
01:55:31,290 --> 01:55:32,990
I don't think I won that one.

4025
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:35,370
I definitely didn't win that one.

4026
01:55:35,650 --> 01:55:37,670
It counts coins from coin minigames.

4027
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:38,870
I hate this one.

4028
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:39,270
What's this?

4029
01:55:40,210 --> 01:55:40,730
What?

4030
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:41,610
What?

4031
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:43,490
This is literally just all luck.

4032
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,110
Oh.

4033
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:49,670
Choose a key and put it to a door and hope it works.

4034
01:55:50,130 --> 01:55:50,330
Oh.

4035
01:55:51,670 --> 01:55:52,230
Yeah.

4036
01:55:53,170 --> 01:55:54,950
It truly is Mario Party.

4037
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:56,250
There's literally no skill involved.

4038
01:55:56,530 --> 01:55:58,310
It really is Mario Party.

4039
01:55:58,630 --> 01:56:04,610
The worst part is... you have to wait for everybody to do it or leave.

4040
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:06,710
I'm gonna win.

4041
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:09,930
Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me!

4042
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:12,470
Do you wanna go first?

4043
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:16,130
Oh, what if she... I think she could actually get it on the first try.

4044
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:19,390
The square key goes into the square hole.

4045
01:56:19,730 --> 01:56:21,190
Yeah, she's gonna do it.

4046
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:21,810
None of them are square, bro.

4047
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:24,530
Square!

4048
01:56:25,690 --> 01:56:26,310
Oh, no.

4049
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:29,630
What if it's a circle key?

4050
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:35,070
What if the circle key goes in the square hole?

4051
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:36,750
The square... Oh.

4052
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:38,690
...Idiot...

4053
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:44,770
We're just going in order.

4054
01:56:45,310 --> 01:56:47,790
What if it's the triangle... Oh, it is!

4055
01:56:48,450 --> 01:56:50,050
It's a triangle key!

4056
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:51,170
Did you win??

4057
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:51,590
Yeah.

4058
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:52,210
No.

4059
01:56:52,450 --> 01:56:53,850
Now you can get second place.

4060
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:56,290
Uh... She won!

4061
01:56:56,290 --> 01:57:00,370
Yeah, she might actually get the minigame, star.

4062
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:06,290
It's okay, Fillion.

4063
01:57:06,830 --> 01:57:08,090
Today's not my day.

4064
01:57:08,410 --> 01:57:11,810
I just learned a shape, so this is a huge day for me.

4065
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:15,090
Oh, it's 50-50.

4066
01:57:15,710 --> 01:57:16,390
Unlucky.

4067
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:17,350
Unlucky.

4068
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:19,510
Alright.

4069
01:57:21,090 --> 01:57:21,450
What if?

4070
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:23,130
Yay!

4071
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,070
Dude, that's rough.

4072
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:28,270
Goodbye, Fillion.

4073
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:29,750
That is so rough.

4074
01:57:30,050 --> 01:57:31,850
Wait, so how long can you get a refund for?

4075
01:57:31,850 --> 01:57:32,430
Oh my god.

4076
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:34,850
You can't get a refund for me.

4077
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:36,350
You have to play forever.

4078
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:39,510
No game will ever go on sale on the Nintendo eShop.

4079
01:57:40,430 --> 01:57:41,250
That's rough, buddy.

4080
01:57:41,810 --> 01:57:42,070
Okay.

4081
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:43,670
Oh my god.

4082
01:57:45,550 --> 01:57:46,050
Yeah.

4083
01:57:46,690 --> 01:57:46,950
Yeah.

4084
01:57:47,950 --> 01:57:48,970
It's not even a 41.

4085
01:57:49,250 --> 01:57:50,230
Hold on now.

4086
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:51,770
You might get another star.

4087
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:53,490
Chat, what have I won?

4088
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:57,810
You could get the mini.

4089
01:57:57,810 --> 01:57:58,650
You could get the mini.

4090
01:57:58,910 --> 01:57:59,410
Bonus stars.

4091
01:57:59,910 --> 01:58:00,510
You never know.

4092
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:05,190
Yeah, look, that's my entire career.

4093
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:07,190
And it's over.

4094
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:10,030
Oh.

4095
01:58:11,090 --> 01:58:13,310
I really, I really stagnated.

4096
01:58:13,910 --> 01:58:15,830
You peaked in high school.

4097
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:18,370
Yeah, I really did.

4098
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:20,270
Alright.

4099
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:21,170
Miss Fortune.

4100
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:22,030
Miss Fortune bonus.

4101
01:58:22,210 --> 01:58:23,270
Let's get you that bonus.

4102
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:25,190
I think it's... I think it's... Yay!

4103
01:58:26,410 --> 01:58:26,670
What?

4104
01:58:28,570 --> 01:58:28,570
What?

4105
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:30,190
That's... Yay.

4106
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:32,130
Eh-heh.

4107
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:33,770
Lucky me.

4108
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:34,270
Rich.

4109
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:35,530
Oh wait, that's Zen.

4110
01:58:36,010 --> 01:58:37,070
Oh, that's not fair.

4111
01:58:37,810 --> 01:58:38,410
It's over.

4112
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:39,390
Game's over.

4113
01:58:39,450 --> 01:58:39,470
Yeah.

4114
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:40,330
Zen won.

4115
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:41,430
Game's bugged.

4116
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:42,590
How did I not win the Pity Star?

4117
01:58:42,710 --> 01:58:42,790
End it all.

4118
01:58:42,990 --> 01:58:43,590
End the game.

4119
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:44,170
End the game.

4120
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:44,850
Close the game.

4121
01:58:45,010 --> 01:58:46,270
Zen picked the game.

4122
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:47,290
Zen wins.

4123
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:48,190
I'm surprised as you are.

4124
01:58:48,190 --> 01:58:51,950
This is the worst Mario Party game of all time.

4125
01:58:52,590 --> 01:58:53,250
No wonder.

4126
01:58:53,250 --> 01:58:55,870
I knew she wanted us to play Mario Party.

4127
01:58:57,010 --> 01:58:57,670
I cannot believe you did not get that misfortune star.

4128
01:58:57,670 --> 01:59:00,410
Yeah, I'm surprised Fillion didn't get the misfortune.

4129
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:06,000
Cheat.

4130
01:59:06,660 --> 01:59:08,780
Why did we let her host a room too?

4131
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:12,960
Damn.

4132
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:13,640
Damn.

4133
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:16,420
Maybe I shouldn't have stolen her star.

4134
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:17,960
That's fine.

4135
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:18,880
Chance time.

4136
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:21,740
Hey.

4137
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:23,900
Oh, Fillion, you got the Amble Award.

4138
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:24,960
What's the Amble Award?

4139
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,260
What is Amble?

4140
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:26,980
Let me see.

4141
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:27,920
I'll look it up.

4142
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:37,580
Um... Amble Award... Mario Party... Yeah, that's how spaces traveled.

4143
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:40,140
I went two spaces more than Zen did.

4144
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:46,680
It says... Um... All I did was get my steps in for an hour and a half.

4145
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:51,560
Apparently it means that you traveled.

4146
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:53,060
Apparently it means that you traveled the least spaces.

4147
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,480
No, it's the most.

4148
01:59:56,060 --> 01:59:56,700
Jesus Christ.

4149
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:04,380
I'm pretty... You're telling me I've worn the hearts out of everyone and I still got last.

4150
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:05,280
Wait, I'm looking.

4151
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:05,860
I'm looking.

4152
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:06,940
Maybe I'm wrong.

4153
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:13,780
Doki, you could have just... No, if I didn't steal your star.

4154
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:16,600
If I didn't steal your star, I would have been last.

4155
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:16,940
Last, Fillion.

4156
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,240
Someone had to be last.

4157
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:19,700
And it wasn't gonna be me.

4158
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:24,560
It wasn't... It wasn't going to meet me, Fillion.

4159
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,960
I played the not last card.

4160
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,360
Goal achieved.

4161
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:32,060
Yay.

4162
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:34,440
Oh, wait.

4163
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,020
No, it is the most spaces.

4164
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:38,940
Fillion, you traveled two more spaces than me.

4165
02:00:39,660 --> 02:00:40,120
Thanks.

4166
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,960
Yeah, good job.

4167
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:43,200
Good job, everybody.

4168
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:43,660
You lost a lot.

4169
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,540
I'm proud of all of us.

4170
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:47,400
I really like Mario.

4171
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:49,740
Yay.

4172
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:52,040
Me too.

4173
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:55,900
Alright.

4174
02:00:56,980 --> 02:01:00,000
I wonder what Zentreya's player card looks like.

4175
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:00,480
Wow.

4176
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:05,180
I'm not surprised at the person who chose the game and also created the only one.

4177
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:05,460
I know.

4178
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:06,460
Don't think you need to do that.

4179
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:10,400
Why is it... I'm sure it's... Wait, how do you see the card?

4180
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:13,380
Why is Bowser and Peach standing together like that?

4181
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:14,400
Why...

4182
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,900
How do you see the card?

4183
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:17,760
Didn't you hear?

4184
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:18,560
Oh.

4185
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:20,360
Five games left?

4186
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:20,520
No.

4187
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:20,840
Hear what?

4188
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:21,860
What are they here?

4189
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:23,720
Peach and Mario are only friends.

4190
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:26,660
58 hours and 21 minutes?

4191
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:27,840
Nintendo confirmed.

4192
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,360
Oh my god.

4193
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:36,980
That's like... You spend like at least two days in... Almost two days locked in a room playing Mario Party.

4194
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:39,660
Yay.

4195
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:40,580
Please.

4196
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:43,080
Kill you.

4197
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:48,080
Oh, I like how Mario... I like yours is... Um...

4198
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:54,740
Should we do one more game since that was one hour?

4199
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:55,760
The loss.

4200
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:57,280
Truly is loss.

4201
02:01:57,680 --> 02:01:59,000
Well, you know, I'm pretty busy.

4202
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:01,700
Oh, I think I'll... You might win this one, though.

4203
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:02,280
Who knows?

4204
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:03,620
Because she hates us, bro.

4205
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:04,080
You might win.

4206
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:04,680
Yeah, you might win.

4207
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:05,840
Yeah, you might win.

4208
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:06,040
You might win.

4209
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:07,900
Yeah, you might win this time.

4210
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:09,120
Ah, no.

4211
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:10,520
I think I'm just... I don't know.

4212
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:11,820
I just... I don't think I have time tonight.

4213
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:12,500
Like...

4214
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,260
What if I give you the easiest one?

4215
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:16,340
Oh, what if... So Filia's gonna end as the biggest loser.

4216
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:16,740
Okay, Filia, then what if we...

4217
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:19,820
Uh, what if we scheduled another one for another time, then?

4218
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:22,120
Yeah, we can talk about that.

4219
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:22,800
We can do it.

4220
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,820
We scheduled it right now.

4221
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,100
We could just talk about it.

4222
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:27,120
I want to do it again.

4223
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:27,740
I can't.

4224
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:27,900
I can't.

4225
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:28,440
I can't.

4226
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:28,660
I can't.

4227
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:28,740
I can't.

4228
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:29,320
I can't.

4229
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:29,640
Please.

4230
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:29,960
Please.

4231
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:30,200
No.

4232
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:30,520
Please.

4233
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:30,700
No.

4234
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:30,940
Please.

4235
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,100
No.

4236
02:02:31,140 --> 02:02:31,400
I'm done.

4237
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:31,680
I'm done.

4238
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:32,420
We're doing it.

4239
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:33,140
Oh my God.

4240
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:34,340
You should do the Bowser world.

4241
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:35,360
That was fun.

4242
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:36,000
Sub me out.

4243
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:37,220
I don't want to.

4244
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:38,740
Sub me out.

4245
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:39,580
Sub me out.

4246
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:40,360
Too late.

4247
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:41,680
I'm done.

4248
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:41,760
No.

4249
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:41,760
I can't do it.

4250
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,580
Well, Zenchai is already starting one.

4251
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:46,420
So even if you leave, we're going to have to pick up on it eventually.

4252
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:46,520
Oh, that's crazy.

4253
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:47,120
You guys can.

4254
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:48,660
I'll go find you a sub.

4255
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:50,880
A what?

4256
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:53,040
I'm putting it on the easiest map.

4257
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:53,680
Yeah.

4258
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:55,380
How about that?

4259
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:58,380
Will that make you feel good?

4260
02:02:59,120 --> 02:02:59,500
No.

4261
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:01,340
Are we going to play baby mode?

4262
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:03,200
I want to go home.

4263
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,140
It's okay.

4264
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,500
I got you.

4265
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:06,740
Oh, give her a handicap.

4266
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:08,100
Give her a handicap.

4267
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:08,620
Don't worry.

4268
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:11,320
Can I get five?

4269
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:12,780
You got a good idea.

4270
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:16,040
Give her a star.

4271
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:18,980
No, I don't want to.

4272
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:19,820
One star.

4273
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:20,700
Yeah, one star.

4274
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:21,500
Here you go.

4275
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:23,240
No, I don't want a hand out.

4276
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:24,000
There you go.

4277
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:26,520
That is going to make me get mugged.

4278
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:31,300
I guess we're just going to have to pick this up on another day, man.

4279
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:33,640
I don't want to play.

4280
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:35,040
We're going to do a different day.

4281
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:37,880
Okay, guys, I can find you a sub.

4282
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:40,180
Yeah.

4283
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:43,860
Next week, Mario Party again.

4284
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:43,980
Come on.

4285
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,420
You love us.

4286
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,140
Next week, next week, next week.

4287
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:48,520
She doesn't like us anymore.

4288
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:51,620
I actually don't think I have time for a whole second game though.

4289
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:56,460
Oh, my God.

4290
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:58,220
Make a wiggler's tree party.

4291
02:03:58,220 --> 02:03:59,840
I can't believe you're already leaving us.

4292
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:01,020
I'm sorry.

4293
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:01,500
Damn.

4294
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:02,400
Damn.

4295
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:05,500
Damn.

4296
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,000
Can't believe it.

4297
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:08,180
Just because she does.

4298
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:08,840
She hates.

4299
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:09,400
You sure?

4300
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:10,640
Yeah.

4301
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:14,040
How many games?

4302
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,060
How many rounds is this?

4303
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:18,600
The same amount.

4304
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:20,280
Just ten.

4305
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:20,700
I can't.

4306
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:21,860
I don't have time for that.

4307
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:27,240
It's ok, we can always pick it up next week.

4308
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:29,680
I can find you guys a fourth.

4309
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:32,880
What do you guys think?

4310
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:33,660
And then you guys can play another?

4311
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:35,040
What?

4312
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:38,060
I can find a fourth for you guys, and you guys play another?

4313
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:40,600
I got someone in my chat list.

4314
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,740
But there's never a prospect.

4315
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:45,100
I mean, we can do it five turns.

4316
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:46,620
Yippee!

4317
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:48,400
Oh, I won't be.

4318
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:49,940
I'm not free next week.

4319
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:54,180
The week after.

4320
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:56,760
Oh wait, no, I can't do that.

4321
02:04:57,340 --> 02:04:59,360
Oh, and then we never meet again.

4322
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:00,920
Next month!

4323
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:01,700
Next month!

4324
02:05:02,020 --> 02:05:02,440
Next month!

4325
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:06,240
We never saw each other again after today.

4326
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:11,100
I mean, we could do five turns.

4327
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:13,020
Five turns is like, what?

4328
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:16,340
Oh, I can help out that.

4329
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:16,600
I can't.

4330
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:17,380
I don't, I cannot.

4331
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:21,540
I think Fillion needs to go.

4332
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:23,620
Yeah, I think she has to go now.

4333
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:25,000
Yay!

4334
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:25,720
Yeah.

4335
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:28,680
It's ok.

4336
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:30,640
We'll find a time.

4337
02:05:31,660 --> 02:05:31,860
Deal!

4338
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:35,080
Alright, how do I, how do I, how do I go, how do I hop out?

4339
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:36,920
Ooh, can I be an AI?

4340
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:38,220
You closed your switch.

4341
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:41,240
Yeah, we go to the party plaza.

4342
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:42,520
Can you guys make me an AI?

4343
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:43,740
We have to go over to yeah.

4344
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,380
Oh, frick yeah.

4345
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:46,940
Alright, make me a bot.

4346
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:48,300
Alright.

4347
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:49,220
X.

4348
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:50,300
X.

4349
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,680
That was fun though.

4350
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:54,920
Yeah!

4351
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:56,720
Well, fun for me.

4352
02:05:56,900 --> 02:05:58,020
It was fun for me too.

4353
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:00,560
I had a great time, guys.

4354
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:01,300
Yeah.

4355
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:01,840
GG's.

4356
02:06:02,700 --> 02:06:03,120
Yay.

4357
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:03,840
GG's.

4358
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:05,100
GG's, everybody.

4359
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:06,540
GG's, guys.

4360
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:09,160
Thank you for taking the L, Fillion.

4361
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:09,880
Yeah, thanks.

4362
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:10,560
It's a lot of work.

4363
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,100
So all of us could have such a good time.

4364
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:13,020
Yeah!

4365
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:16,560
It's a great sacrifice for the greater cause, you know?

4366
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:17,900
You did good.

4367
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:18,140
Content!

4368
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:18,860
Thanks!

4369
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:19,120
Don't worry.

4370
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:21,580
That's the Mario Party experience.

4371
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:22,560
True.

4372
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:23,560
Yeah.

4373
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:25,580
Some games are really fucking rough.

4374
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,320
We added two more hours to Zen's 60 hour journey in Mario Party.

4375
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:32,100
Yeah.

4376
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:33,240
Kill me.

4377
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:37,420
You did really good, though.

4378
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:38,720
Don't worry.

4379
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:40,700
GG's, guys.

4380
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:44,480
I usually just end around four hours, so going six hours would be crazy work.

4381
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:45,520
Yeah.

4382
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:48,500
Yeah, I literally just don't have the time, but...

4383
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:49,640
Yeah, it was really fun.

4384
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:50,140
Yeah!

4385
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:51,520
Have a good night, guys!

4386
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:52,980
GG's, everyone!

4387
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:54,300
GG's!

4388
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:55,920
Thank you for playing!

4389
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:56,700
Yeah!

4390
02:06:57,420 --> 02:06:57,680
Bye!

4391
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:58,780
Thanks, everybody!

4392
02:06:59,000 --> 02:06:59,920
I'll see you guys!

4393
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:00,400
Bye!

4394
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:01,440
Bye!

4395
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:01,640
Bye-bye!

4396
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:02,840
Adios, friends.

4397
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:04,680
Whoa!

4398
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:05,920
Alright.

4399
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:14,280
I sort of missed my premio's delivery, so they were like, we can't deliver it because I was too busy, I guess...

4400
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,760
Too busy not being last!

4401
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:18,760
I'll call them later.

4402
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,680
Let me swap screens real quick.

4403
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,520
Uh...

4404
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,300
Oh, I forgot about that picture.

4405
02:07:24,580 --> 02:07:25,400
Oh my gosh.

4406
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:26,840
Um, but yeah...

4407
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:27,100
Oh, yeah!

4408
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:30,740
Also, I wanted to add, when I was trying to fix my Switch...

4409
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:36,140
Switch, I unplugged my third monitor, because I was like, what if it's my third monitor?

4410
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:38,140
What if that's the reason why it's not working?

4411
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:43,040
I restarted my PC four times, because I was like, what if I just restart my PC?

4412
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:44,080
Maybe that's why.

4413
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:51,920
It's literally all because of my stupid fucking Switch controller being plugged into my Switch.

4414
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:54,480
I didn't know that was a thing.

4415
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:59,840
If you have your Switch controller plugged in, your game capture doesn't work.

4416
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,020
And I didn't realize that.

4417
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:02,400
I was like, fucking freaking out.

4418
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:04,580
And was like, um...

4419
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:09,560
Yeah, literally, like, four hours of just trying to figure out what was going on.

4420
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:14,020
Okay, I didn't want to say it in the beginning of the stream, because I didn't want to kill the mood.

4421
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:17,360
But there was a reason why I was like, super off today.

4422
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:20,280
Um, and also, the original reason...

4423
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:23,000
Okay, I'll let you guys know now, since like, uh...

4424
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,720
But the original reason why, at first, I had to push it.

4425
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:28,560
Because originally, we were going to push it for 30 minutes.

4426
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:32,300
Um, was because, like, you guys know.

4427
02:08:32,660 --> 02:08:35,480
Um, I had to take Doki to the hospital.

4428
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:38,340
And we, um...

4429
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:40,920
An hour before the stream...

4430
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:43,360
30 minutes before the stream was supposed to start, originally.

4431
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:45,760
I got a call from the vet.

4432
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:48,340
And basically, it's...

4433
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:50,100
It is another disc issue.

4434
02:08:50,700 --> 02:08:55,540
Um, so obviously, that was like, a huge thing to...

4435
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:58,680
Um, it was a huge, like, news as well.

4436
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:02,420
Um, but the thing is, I can't do another surgery.

4437
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:05,280
Um, I wanted to update you guys this.

4438
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:07,140
Just cause like, you know, just to let you guys know.

4439
02:09:07,460 --> 02:09:11,000
But, I can't do another surgery, because it's at the neck this time.

4440
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,400
Um, and they were saying that because it's at the neck, the, um...

4441
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:17,160
Success rate for that is lower.

4442
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:18,880
And it could actually get worse.

4443
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:20,520
Uh, but...

4444
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,740
The good news is that...

4445
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:25,180
The good news is that, um...

4446
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,620
It's just...

4447
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:27,960
He just is like...

4448
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,280
It's just a little...

4449
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:31,000
He's just limping a little bit.

4450
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:36,100
And, um, because of that, it's just more so of just four weeks of medication.

4451
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:39,900
So, he's gonna be on like, a new set of medication.

4452
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,560
Um, and, um, it's just literally like, four weeks of rest and meds.

4453
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:49,420
And, it's not...

4454
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:53,220
The disc issue is not in a way where he won't be able to move or anything.

4455
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:57,880
It's more so of like, um, it's just a small limp.

4456
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:00,860
Because they said like, oh, there's no neurological issue.

4457
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,860
It's just there is pain when...

4458
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:04,220
On his like, right leg.

4459
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:05,360
And his neck.

4460
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:08,680
So, because of that, um...

4461
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:10,580
Because of that, uh...

4462
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:11,000
He'll...

4463
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,580
He'll just need to rest and relax for four weeks.

4464
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:15,000
And, if four weeks...

4465
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,080
But the only thing is...

4466
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:18,020
The thing I'm scared about is that...

4467
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:21,500
They said that, um, if four weeks...

4468
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:23,900
If four more weeks, he doesn't rec...

4469
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:25,380
Like, he still feels pain.

4470
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:28,200
Then, like, we'll look into surgery.

4471
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:30,100
And see if that's an option.

4472
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:33,260
So, I'm just hoping that...

4473
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:35,960
Because they said it's an 80% recovery rate.

4474
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:42,180
It's an 80% recovery rate of just rest and meds for four weeks of not moving.

4475
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:44,480
Um...

4476
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:46,740
So, that's why I was...

4477
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:49,100
Obviously, I really appreciate the girls for pushing.

4478
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:51,000
I asked an extra hour...

4479
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:51,460
To?

4480
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:55,400
Because, obviously, I was like, I can't play Mario Party after hearing that.

4481
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:55,980
I...

4482
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:00,040
I was like...

4483
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:00,600
I...

4484
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:01,640
I can't...

4485
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:02,060
I...

4486
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:02,420
After...

4487
02:11:02,420 --> 02:11:04,740
I need more than 30 minutes after...

4488
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:06,480
Like, I had to push it out.

4489
02:11:06,620 --> 02:11:10,640
Because I was like, I can't play Mario Party after hearing that news.

4490
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:14,960
So, I really...

4491
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:15,640
But...

4492
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:19,680
But while I was doing that, I was trying to get my game capture to work, too.

4493
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:25,200
So, I was like, obviously, I was not having the best day while trying to find my stupid...

4494
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:28,740
While trying to fucking find my stupid game capture.

4495
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:32,620
Because I was like, I got the con.

4496
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:34,700
I'm still trying to troubleshoot my...

4497
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:37,840
I'm still trying to fucking find my game capture, too.

4498
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:39,900
So, I was just like, where the fuck?

4499
02:11:40,100 --> 02:11:42,760
I almost, like, decided that, like...

4500
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:48,800
I was going to, like, drive the Best Buy to, like, fucking buy a game capture.

4501
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:52,840
But luckily, I found it in the box of clothes for some reason.

4502
02:11:52,980 --> 02:11:54,000
It was in the box of clothes.

4503
02:11:54,300 --> 02:12:01,820
Um, but then I had to spend... I got an extra hour, so I was, like, using that extra hour to fucking troubleshoot my game capture.

4504
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:05,960
Because I couldn't get it to work until the last 10 minutes.

4505
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:08,520
The last 10 minutes I was able to get that.

4506
02:12:08,620 --> 02:12:14,180
That's why, like, you guys could sort of tell I was, like, I was, like, not locked in.

4507
02:12:18,820 --> 02:12:24,200
I was not that locked in today, in terms of, like, gaming-wise, I was...

4508
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:32,480
But, um, but I hope you guys still have fun.

4509
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:36,740
Um, I still kept the collab, because I did want to put my mind off of things.

4510
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:40,620
Um, but, uh, he is getting picked up by the Dog Sitter today.

4511
02:12:41,020 --> 02:12:47,540
And, uh, the Dog Sitter, like, is very good at taking care of, uh, Doki, Amber Doge.

4512
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:49,660
So, uh, she's really good at taking care of Dad.

4513
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:53,720
And, like, the Dog Sitter loves- loves him, too.

4514
02:12:53,980 --> 02:12:59,300
So, um, she is gonna be looking after him for around two weeks.

4515
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:02,560
So then- and then after those two weeks, he'll be back with me.

4516
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:07,020
And then I'll look over- look, uh, look- look after him for the next two weeks.

4517
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:10,060
So- So, yeah.

4518
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:11,780
No, he deserves to get spoiled.

4519
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:13,580
It's just- it is a lot of monies.

4520
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:16,080
But, like, honestly, like, I'm okay.

4521
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:18,040
That CT scan was fucking $2,000.

4522
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:23,520
But at least, like, now, I know for sure what it is.

4523
02:13:23,700 --> 02:13:26,980
And they're giving me a new set of medication.

4524
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:35,900
Um, we're giving- yeah, they're giving me a new set of medication, um, to help with the healing, uh, with the disc stuff.

4525
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:41,900
Um, so yeah, like, I am- I have- I think if- like, I'm gonna say when- when.

4526
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:42,720
I'm not gonna say if.

4527
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:43,780
I'm not gonna say what if.

4528
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:48,340
When he gets better, I'm gonna treat him more like a senior dog.

4529
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:56,540
In a way where, like, I ask him, like- Cause, like, the thing that sucks is that dad really likes- Dad really likes fetch.

4530
02:13:57,260 --> 02:14:02,660
And I- I'm sad that, like, he won't get to play fetch the same way he likes it.

4531
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:05,020
So, like, I have to roll the ball now.

4532
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:10,400
So, he can't, like, um, I have to roll the ball instead of, like, actually throwing the ball.

4533
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:13,980
Because he loves running for the ball and jumping up to catch it.

4534
02:14:14,100 --> 02:14:16,740
I think that's what caused the issue.

4535
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:24,900
Because, like, when I was playing fetch with him, he always- he loves to, like- Like, even though I try to make- like, throw fire so he doesn't do that.

4536
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:30,360
He does, like, love to run, like, you know, Mach 8 towards a ball and try to catch it in the air.

4537
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:33,160
Um, which I try to minimize.

4538
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:38,020
But, obviously, you know, I can't stop him from doing- being a dog.

4539
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:42,700
So, I'm gonna try, like, to roll- The thing- Okay, this is also- fucks up.

4540
02:14:42,860 --> 02:14:46,060
But, like, there are other dogs also playing fetch at the dog park.

4541
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:49,120
And he also tries to chase other balls, too.

4542
02:14:49,180 --> 02:15:01,020
So, like, I have to, like- I have to, like- Uh, I guess, like, if I see another- another, uh, owner playing fetch, I have to bring him away.

4543
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:04,640
Because, like, he's gonna play- he's gonna chase after their ball as well- as well.

4544
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:06,980
So- Oh, so he pooped in the hospital.

4545
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:13,420
Because he was a little fucking- Okay, um, okay, I can't say that because he's going through a lot.

4546
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:14,600
But he was a little bitch.

4547
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:18,900
But when I took him to the hospital in the morning, um, he- he peed.

4548
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:21,980
Uh, there's, like, a little area for him to, like, pee and poop.

4549
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:23,000
So, he peed.

4550
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:24,180
And then he was like, I'm done.

4551
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:25,220
And I was like, no, no, no.

4552
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:26,420
You haven't pooped yet.

4553
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:28,180
You have to poop before we go in.

4554
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:29,460
And he's like, no.

4555
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:32,380
He's like, I wanna go inside now.

4556
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:33,600
And I was like, okay.

4557
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:35,820
But, like, no pooping inside.

4558
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:43,500
And the moment I sat down, because I had to fill out a form, this other owner was like, oh, um, your pet's having an accident.

4559
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:45,380
And I literally looked to my side.

4560
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:47,880
And I see him squatting and just pooping on the floor.

4561
02:15:47,980 --> 02:15:49,300
And I'm like, are you fucking...

4562
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:49,540
I...

4563
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:53,360
I was just like, mm, in...

4564
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:54,160
Oh, my God.

4565
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:56,160
You're in front of everybody.

4566
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:58,040
You little whore.

4567
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:00,580
Like...

4568
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:03,020
Because I was like, come on.

4569
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:04,540
Just do your little poop.

4570
02:16:04,660 --> 02:16:05,600
And then we go inside.

4571
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,220
And he's like, no.

4572
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:10,380
And then he, like, like, I don't want to pull on his, like, lead harness, too.

4573
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:13,400
Because, like, you know, I don't want him to, like...

4574
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:16,020
Like, like, like, use his legs too much.

4575
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:17,420
And then he's like, no.

4576
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:21,880
I'm gonna...

4577
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:23,220
I'm gonna just...

4578
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:24,280
I want to go inside.

4579
02:16:25,060 --> 02:16:27,660
Uh, he wanted everyone...

4580
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:27,800
Yeah.

4581
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:30,480
He wanted everyone to fucking watch.

4582
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:32,440
And I was like, are you fucking...

4583
02:16:33,860 --> 02:16:34,300
Um...

4584
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:35,040
Kidding me.

4585
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:35,780
But, no.

4586
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,480
For those who are wanting, the cleaner doesn't rearrange my stuff anymore.

4587
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:39,700
She did it one time.

4588
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:40,860
And then never again.

4589
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:42,680
Um...

4590
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:45,620
But I'm glad I didn't go out and buy another game capture card.

4591
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:46,460
Because, like...

4592
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:47,660
Elgato capture card.

4593
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:49,160
Because those are fucking expensive.

4594
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:49,940
So...

4595
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:51,060
I don't know.

4596
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:52,980
The fact that I'm so sad.

4597
02:16:52,980 --> 02:16:54,460
I had to actually, like...

4598
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:56,300
I opened my PS5.

4599
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:58,160
Just so I could, like...

4600
02:16:58,160 --> 02:16:58,500
Like...

4601
02:16:58,500 --> 02:16:59,260
Because I was desperate.

4602
02:16:59,420 --> 02:17:04,260
I was like, maybe it's because the HDMI cable is not a console HDMI cable.

4603
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:05,460
So, maybe...

4604
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:08,980
Maybe if I used a PS5 HDMI cable...

4605
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:09,820
Um...

4606
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:10,740
Then it'll work.

4607
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:11,920
And then it didn't work.

4608
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:12,780
I was like, I don't know.

4609
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:14,300
I don't know what to do anymore.

4610
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:14,980
I...

4611
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:16,260
I don't...

4612
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:17,520
Yeah, I spent...

4613
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:19,680
I spent enough money.

4614
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:21,540
Um...

4615
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:22,280
Um...

4616
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:22,600
But, yeah.

4617
02:17:22,640 --> 02:17:24,220
That's why I was, like, super low energy.

4618
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:24,940
But I still...

4619
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:26,800
You know, I tried my best to...

4620
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:27,680
Have...

4621
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:28,080
Um...

4622
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:28,280
Fun.

4623
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:29,680
And to...

4624
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:31,160
Um...

4625
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:33,120
Tried my best to, you know, talk to...

4626
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:33,480
Like...

4627
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:35,460
Make sure, you know, we still have fun.

4628
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,720
Obviously, I didn't want to force anything.

4629
02:17:38,060 --> 02:17:40,360
But I still tried my best to, like...

4630
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:41,300
Uh...

4631
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:41,400
Uh...

4632
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:43,500
You know, make sure it's a fun collab for everybody.

4633
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:44,260
Uh...

4634
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:45,820
I felt bad rescheduling, too.

4635
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:47,480
I didn't want to reschedule it, as well.

4636
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:49,080
And I really needed something to...

4637
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:51,820
I really needed something to, like...

4638
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:52,260
Uh...

4639
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:53,680
Take my mind off of things.

4640
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:55,920
So, that's why I kept the collab going.

4641
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:57,080
Um...

4642
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:59,000
And also, because, like, this collab...

4643
02:17:59,000 --> 02:17:59,220
Uh...

4644
02:17:59,220 --> 02:18:01,540
Philly had asked me for a collab for, like...

4645
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:03,000
Three weeks ago.

4646
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,360
I think, like, three to four...

4647
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:04,820
Before...

4648
02:18:04,820 --> 02:18:05,720
Before July.

4649
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:06,820
Before July.

4650
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:09,220
She wanted me to join this collab.

4651
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:10,500
But, like...

4652
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:10,760
Uh...

4653
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:11,520
Before July.

4654
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:13,220
But I was, like...

4655
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:14,740
I had, like, Anime Expo.

4656
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:15,580
And then I was, like...

4657
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:17,200
And then, like, my other collabs...

4658
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:19,100
Leading up to this one.

4659
02:18:19,460 --> 02:18:19,940
Um...

4660
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:22,500
This was, like, literally the only week where I was free.

4661
02:18:23,180 --> 02:18:23,700
Um...

4662
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:24,400
Because, like...

4663
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:28,060
After Anime Expo, we had our Emissionary Zero collab.

4664
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:30,000
Which I organized in advance.

4665
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:32,100
Because I organized three collabs in advance.

4666
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:33,600
So, I had, like, Emissionary Zero.

4667
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:34,680
And I had Peak.

4668
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:36,940
And I had Emissionary Zero again.

4669
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:40,300
And...

4670
02:18:41,540 --> 02:18:42,500
And so...

4671
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:44,600
Um...

4672
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:46,200
Uh...

4673
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:46,920
Um...

4674
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:47,420
So, like...

4675
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:48,300
It was, like...

4676
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:48,900
Like...

4677
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:49,760
I had, like, all of the...

4678
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:50,560
So, they're, like...

4679
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:51,220
I was, like...

4680
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:52,080
Sorry, Philian.

4681
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:53,620
I had all these...

4682
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:55,820
All these collabs...

4683
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:56,220
Uh...

4684
02:18:56,220 --> 02:18:56,780
In advance.

4685
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:57,700
I'm sorry.

4686
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:58,680
So, like...

4687
02:18:58,680 --> 02:19:00,220
This is the only day I'm free.

4688
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:01,080
Uh...

4689
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:05,040
Which was, coincidentally, my NASCAR week, too.

4690
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:06,120
Yeah, yeah.

4691
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:07,120
So...

4692
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:07,420
Or...

4693
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:07,800
Emissionary...

4694
02:19:08,820 --> 02:19:09,100
Emissionary...

4695
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:09,440
I don't know.

4696
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:10,120
I don't know what it's called.

4697
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:11,160
I don't know how to pronounce it.

4698
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:11,940
Emissary?

4699
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:12,660
Emissary Zero.

4700
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:12,880
Sorry.

4701
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:13,740
Emissary Zero.

4702
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:14,060
Yeah.

4703
02:19:14,480 --> 02:19:15,180
I had, like...

4704
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:16,820
A lot of my collabs...

4705
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:17,340
Um...

4706
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:19,160
Just scheduled it in advance.

4707
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:20,080
So, I was, like...

4708
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:20,460
Sorry!

4709
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:22,580
And so, I didn't want to reschedule it again.

4710
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:23,520
Because of it.

4711
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:24,200
Like...

4712
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:24,420
Because I...

4713
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:25,120
And also, like...

4714
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:26,820
You know, it would have been, like, super last minute, too.

4715
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:27,320
I was, like...

4716
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,700
Oh, I didn't want to do that.

4717
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:29,340
I didn't want to...

4718
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:30,080
So, at best...

4719
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:38,180
Like, I'm really glad that they let me... They let me... They let me... Push the collab an hour early.

4720
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:40,840
Just so I could, like, you know, I guess, like, process everything.

4721
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:45,960
But yeah, I had a great time.

4722
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:50,760
It took me a while to get into it, into, like, the collab.

4723
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,240
Like, it took my mind, like, you know, lock in.

4724
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:54,500
Well, not gaming-wise.

4725
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:56,560
I was definitely not locked in gaming-wise.

4726
02:19:56,560 --> 02:20:04,480
I... The only... I felt like the only... The only game I won was definitely...

4727
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:06,160
Was the fucking button mashing.

4728
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:07,380
Because it was, like, no brain.

4729
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:08,580
Just press the button.

4730
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:10,040
But I felt like I was so slow.

4731
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:15,260
I felt my reaction speed was so slow.

4732
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:16,060
Yeah.

4733
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:18,760
Yeah.

4734
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:24,500
I could feel like I wasn't mashing as fast as I could.

4735
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:26,340
So I was like, oh, man.

4736
02:20:26,460 --> 02:20:28,060
I don't think, like, I'm gonna win.

4737
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:29,000
I was like, wait, I won?

4738
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:31,040
And I was just like, wait, what?

4739
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:34,980
Not... Yeah.

4740
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:37,040
Um...

4741
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:40,460
But I felt like my reaction speed was so slow today.

4742
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:43,480
Um... Because I was, like... I guess, like, tired of it, too.

4743
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:45,520
Um...

4744
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:47,920
Um...

4745
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:51,620
Yeah, but I was, like, my... The other games, I was...

4746
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:53,900
I was like, I don't know what I'm doing.

4747
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:57,720
Also, it didn't help that I was playing with a monitor on my lap.

4748
02:20:58,660 --> 02:20:59,400
Because, like...

4749
02:20:59,400 --> 02:20:59,980
I don't know.

4750
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:01,620
Was my stream lagging a little?

4751
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,480
I don't... I couldn't tell if the game...

4752
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:05,300
Was my game lagging on stream?

4753
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:09,220
I felt like the game was lagging a little bit on stream.

4754
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:10,400
But I couldn't... I...

4755
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:11,600
I couldn't tell.

4756
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:13,840
There were, like, small little...

4757
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:14,980
Oh, it was fine?

4758
02:21:14,980 --> 02:21:17,040
Okay, um...

4759
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:19,240
Okay, so, like, on OBS...

4760
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:24,080
On OBS, the game was lagging a little bit on OBS.

4761
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:26,320
And so, like...

4762
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:27,020
Um...

4763
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:28,560
It would, like...

4764
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:30,640
It would, like, frame jump a little.

4765
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:32,740
So, like, I would have, like...

4766
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:35,080
Like, it would frame jump a little bit.

4767
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:37,280
And it, like, threw me off.

4768
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:38,500
So, I was like, isn't it...

4769
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:40,020
It must have been an OBS thing.

4770
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:41,020
It wasn't input delay.

4771
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:42,180
I... I didn't...

4772
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:43,060
There was no...

4773
02:21:43,060 --> 02:21:45,000
There was no input delay.

4774
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:49,700
But like, I could feel the very, very small frame jumps.

4775
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:51,700
But that messed with me.

4776
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:53,840
Like, that like actually messed with me at first.

4777
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:56,500
So I was like, okay, I'll just play with a monitor on my lap.

4778
02:21:56,680 --> 02:22:07,920
And then like, but because I couldn't put the monitor in front of me, if I put the monitor in front of me, I can't capture myself because my phone, it would be like, is in the back, basically.

4779
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:10,000
It's in the back.

4780
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:13,760
And so I was just like, okay, I have to have it on my lap.

4781
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:16,680
So at least people can see me reacting.

4782
02:22:19,620 --> 02:22:27,900
That's why I had to put it because I didn't have an actual setup to put like, put the monitor in front of me because I put the monitor in front of me.

4783
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:29,520
My phone is behind the monitor.

4784
02:22:29,780 --> 02:22:34,160
So I was just like, oh, man, because I usually I usually just play Mario Party on my OBS.

4785
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:35,480
That's how I play.

4786
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:39,740
I actually play Switch games on through my OBS because there's no input delay.

4787
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,460
But there was a tie.

4788
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:42,620
I don't know why for today.

4789
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:45,160
Everything was just not going okay today.

4790
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:48,760
Everything was just not my day today.

4791
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:53,540
So I usually play it through my OBS because there's no input delay at all.

4792
02:22:53,700 --> 02:23:01,360
But for some reason today, there was like teeny tiny frame jumps and I was like frame drops and I like and I noticed it too.

4793
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:07,740
So when Min was like, the people can only see six... No, that is not fuck.

4794
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:09,020
That is not fuck.

4795
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:17,000
When I can notice raindrops like instantly, that is not... That is fake news.

4796
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:22,640
Like, it like threw me off so hard.

4797
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:25,220
So I was just like, okay, I'll just play with the monitor on my lap.

4798
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:30,740
It's true for me.

4799
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:34,200
I have specialized, okay?

4800
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:37,180
I have specialized.

4801
02:23:38,620 --> 02:23:42,420
But yeah, I really appreciate everyone being here.

4802
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:44,180
Being here too, guys.

4803
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:46,060
It really does mean a lot.

4804
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:48,540
I hope you guys still have a lot of fun.

4805
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:53,660
Um, despite my lower energy, uh, and, um, I'm not last.

4806
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:54,220
Yay!

4807
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:03,520
Look, if I didn't steal that star from Fillion, I would have been last because I would have been broke.

4808
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:07,460
So, um, through coin wise, I had to do it, okay?

4809
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:10,860
Like, someone had to be last and it wasn't going to be me.

4810
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:11,600
I...

4811
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:17,660
Someone had to be last.

4812
02:24:17,660 --> 02:24:18,500
Uh...

4813
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:21,880
I need one win today.

4814
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:23,940
And that was my win.

4815
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:25,700
Uh...

4816
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:29,580
Anyway, um, I am gonna go now, guys.

4817
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,720
I wish I could stay around longer.

4818
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:36,000
But, uh, I have to, um, figure out my...

4819
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,560
Uh, I need to figure out my, uh, pre-cooked meals.

4820
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:42,060
So I can actually get it delivered here today.

4821
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:43,560
Uh...

4822
02:24:44,300 --> 02:24:47,640
So, I gotta call them and then also get...

4823
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:49,600
Dad picked up by the dog sitter today.

4824
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:50,660
So, anyway, guys.

4825
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:52,120
Uh, I hope you guys had a great time.

4826
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:57,120
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, pause, uh, pause, check, get up, and move around to get that blood flowing.

4827
02:24:57,220 --> 02:24:59,200
And if you steal from me, head to bed.

4828
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:00,460
Cause you deserve it.

4829
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:01,980
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4830
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:03,260
Bye, guys.

4831
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:04,100
Bye.

4832
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:04,380
Bye.

4833
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:04,500
Bye.

4834
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:05,600
Bye.
