1
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,360
Hello, hello!

2
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,020
Oh my gosh, the timing for this stream and what I just got added for...

3
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:04,620
Okay, so I just got news about the Disguised Toast Round 2 Marble Rivals Tournament that's next week.

4
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,120
And then we just got the official teams for everybody.

5
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,960
And it's actually crazy because...

6
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,680
I am put in the pro category.

7
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,220
And literally, we got the list.

8
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,100
They're like, now you can talk about this event, the teams, and everything.

9
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,820
Like, six minutes ago.

10
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,300
Actually, six minutes ago.

11
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,500
And I thought it was so funny.

12
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,160
Because I was like, you see everybody?

13
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,820
I can link this because Toast just gave us permission to.

14
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,840
And like...

15
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,180
And like, okay.

16
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,400
I'm like, what the fuck?

17
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,700
Okay, look at who's...

18
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,180
Okay, by the way, Aimbot Calvin got brought back from the fucking grave to participate in this tournament.

19
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,160
I was like, Aimbot Calvin?

20
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,880
He's still alive?

21
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,980
I mean, we all know he's still alive.

22
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,500
But I was like, what the fuck?

23
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,800
We brought back someone?

24
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,600
We brought back Aimbot Calvin for this?

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,040
But like, look at the...

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,860
Surefour and I should have swapped places.

27
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
I was like...

28
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,420
Like, Surefour should have been in the pro category.

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,720
Why the fuck am I...

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,580
Because, okay, look.

31
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,320
It's Sleepy, Aimbot Calvin, More, Booger, Flats, Necros, Mendo.

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,700
And then there's me.

33
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,480
I was like, what am I...

34
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,940
What am I...

35
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,040
What am I doing here?

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,380
I should be like, here.

37
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,700
I should be on the Eternity category.

38
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,900
Surefour hit top 10 solo queue.

39
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,380
I don't understand.

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,920
Like, Surefour hit top 10 solo queue.

41
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,510
Why the fuck am I here at the pro category?

42
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,480
Better than Surefour confirmed.

43
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,100
Anyway, so yeah, this is my team.

44
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,480
It's me, Surefour, Ziox.

45
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,500
I think he's like...

46
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,540
I looked him up because like...

47
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,480
I was like, who's Ziox?

48
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,860
And he's like, better than Surefour.

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,640
He's a Genshin player, I believe.

50
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,800
I think, yeah, he's a Genshin player.

51
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,060
And then I requested Coney and Surefour to be on our team.

52
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,280
And then Toast suggested Nicewig could be on my team.

53
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,060
I was like, fuck yeah.

54
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,580
Fuck you, put Nicewig in here.

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,780
Ziox and Lulu, we're like...

56
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,560
I feel like our team is like everybody that has played Apex at some point in their lives.

57
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,120
Everyone's like, at some point, we've all played Apex somewhere.

58
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,560
I mean, I've interacted with Lulu before, but I've never interacted with Ziox.

59
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,700
And yeah, so...

60
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,380
And then like, okay, not gonna lie.

61
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,760
I think Necro's team...

62
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,240
I mean, I guess Necro's and Andrew are really good.

63
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,060
They're just gonna run Venom, Spider-Man.

64
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,500
I'm just gonna fucking ban Spider-Man and Venom.

65
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,800
Fuck these two.

66
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,620
They were running Venom, Spider-Man this entire time when ranked.

67
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,860
I saw them duo-queuing Venom, Spider-Man this entire time.

68
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,140
I guess like the... I don't know.

69
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,180
I don't know which team I match.

70
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
I think like...

71
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,600
Maybe Mor's team.

72
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,220
Mor's team is a little scary.

73
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,740
Because like...

74
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,720
Mor, Frex, and Timmy are both...

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Individual-wise, they're all really good players individually.

76
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,180
And then, Surefour was like...

77
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,300
Was telling me, he was like...

78
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,340
Looking at the teams, and he was like, let's just run Mantis, Widow.

79
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,880
You on Mantis, me on Widow.

80
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,780
And then we can stomp some of these teams.

81
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,560
And I was like, cool.

82
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,380
Thumbs up.

83
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,440
Thumbs up emoji.

84
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,580
Like, that's our plan.

85
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,620
We're like, alright, yeah, sure, I'm down.

86
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,380
I'm down to fucking run around as Mantis with you.

87
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,460
Sounds about right.

88
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,820
But yes, this is the official teams for the...

89
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,620
For the Disguised Toast Marvel Rivals Tournament that's happening...

90
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,880
Next week.

91
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,100
So, half of offline TV is in here.

92
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,560
I mean, it's run by offline...

93
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,320
I mean, it's Disguised Toast Tournament.

94
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,820
Of course, half of offline TV would be in here.

95
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,780
Yeah, so...

96
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,620
I guess I'm categorized as a pro now?

97
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,420
Like...

98
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,200
Sure, don't be over sure for it.

99
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,580
It's not like sure for it.

100
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,900
Was signed to the Overwatch League.

101
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,960
And was in professional play for like majority of his life.

102
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,660
Oh, it's not like he was top 10 in Marvel Rivals solo queue only.

103
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,320
I thought it was so silly.

104
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,880
I honestly...

105
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,620
I was like, what the fuck?

106
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,720
Holy shit.

107
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,780
Anyway...

108
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,020
But yeah, this is like...

109
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,980
Yeah, where's my Wikipedia?

110
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,620
Where's my...

111
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,300
Everybody else has a Wikipedia but me.

112
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,640
I don't fucking understand.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,240
This is proof that I should have a Wikipedia at that point.

114
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,860
Like, I honestly...

115
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,180
I should have a Wikipedia.

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,860
Also, another announcement.

117
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,500
If you guys didn't know...

118
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,800
I posted a link to it.

119
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,580
But...

120
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,040
My YouTube splashies are out now!

121
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,640
Wow!

122
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:23,900
So...

123
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,480
You can get a tomato me, alt girl me, or a croquis.

124
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,400
So all three of these splashies are out now.

125
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,060
And you can purchase them.

126
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,960
I pinned the link in the description.

127
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,560
I could like copy it again.

128
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,560
I have no use for a doki splash, but I definitely want to add a croquis or tomato one.

129
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,400
Please decide for me, chat.

130
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,920
Why not both mistakes?

131
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,160
If you haven't learned your lesson, you might as well get both splashies.

132
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,380
Thank you for the super chat.

133
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,420
Thank you, thank you.

134
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,220
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

135
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,000
Thank you, thank you.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,020
I'm a variety VTuber in the pro category.

137
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,660
That's what I'm saying!

138
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,320
Even Calvin!

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,840
Calvin has hit like top 10.

140
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,840
He has hit rank 1 in multiple video games.

141
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,760
Which is understandable why he's in the pro category.

142
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,260
But like me in the pro category?

143
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,260
Thank you for the super chat.

144
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,380
Thank you, thank you.

145
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,760
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

146
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,640
Thank you, thank you.

147
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,200
Which support organized two tournament winning Marble Rivals team again?

148
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,300
Back to fact, including sent members.

149
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,760
Sure for it, probably.

150
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you for the super chat.

151
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,340
Thank you, thank you.

152
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,460
But yes, please check out the YouTube link.

153
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,780
Let me paste the link real quick.

154
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:47,840
Yes, check it out right now and support me and YouTube by getting your own official tomato, otoki, or croquis splash.

155
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,820
Right now!

156
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,640
It'll be up for 4 weeks.

157
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,480
Yes, buy my merch.

158
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,220
I love shilling.

159
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,060
It'll be only up for 4 weeks.

160
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,880
And then after 4 weeks, you'll never be able to purchase this again.

161
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,640
So, you should buy now.

162
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,560
Maybe the value will raise up.

163
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,440
You don't know that.

164
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,640
The value of these plushies can go up after that.

165
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,620
I don't know.

166
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,520
Or maybe go down.

167
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know.

168
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,980
That's what...

169
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,640
You gotta take your chances, guys.

170
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,140
Girls, thank you for your very first super chat.

171
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,420
Thank you, thank you.

172
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,720
I'm stuck in the elo held as plat.

173
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,380
Send help.

174
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,640
You know what's the easiest way to climb out of plat?

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,180
Play Rocket Raccoon.

176
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,700
You can have zero hands and still climb with Rocket Raccoon.

177
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,640
Eventually, you will be able to climb out of that elo.

178
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,020
I heard that a lot of people are now like...

179
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,800
That's not even ironic.

180
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:57,180
Unironically, if you really want to climb to GM+, just play Rocket Raccoon.

181
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,740
Because you'll eventually...

182
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,800
You just have to keep playing.

183
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,180
And you'll eventually get to that rank.

184
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,540
Because you gain more than you lose.

185
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,180
Skeleton, thank you for the super chat.

186
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,100
Thank you, thank you.

187
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,780
Doki helped me out of plat.

188
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,640
Now, I'm cool.

189
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,780
Thank you for the super chat.

190
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Thank you, thank you.

191
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,260
There's so many inflated elo players right now in rank.

192
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,180
Because we didn't do a rank reset.

193
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,140
So, because we didn't do a rank...

194
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,660
Everyone's now complaining about how there's so many inflated players.

195
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,380
Because people can actually get to Celestial with a negative win rate.

196
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,860
And it's actually fucked up.

197
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,920
Medi, that's what I'm saying.

198
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,440
You're what?

199
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,100
No, I'm joking.

200
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm...

201
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,680
I'm joking.

202
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,700
Anyway, anyway.

203
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
So, yeah, there's like...

204
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,140
Honestly, there's so many players that are like Celestial or Eternity.

205
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,260
That should not be in Celestial or Eternity.

206
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,320
GM, I think Grandmaster and Marble Rivals is like Diamond in Overwatch.

207
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,000
Honestly.

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,180
Or just Diamond.

209
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,560
It's just Diamond rank in general.

210
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,700
It's just way too easy to get to GM these days.

211
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,080
Okay,

212
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,440
look.

213
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,100
Guys, guys, look.

214
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,000
I...

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,180
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,100
I really have nothing to justify.

217
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,900
But last year, we did not have a lot of merch coming out last year.

218
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,320
Okay?

219
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,480
So, technically, you guys saved all your money from not buying my merch last year.

220
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,420
Because I had not a lot of merch coming out last year.

221
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,860
So, technically, this year is all just, you know, we are all building up to all...

222
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:00,360
Like, build up all the funds you saved from last year to buy this year's merch.

223
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,060
Right?

224
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,760
So...

225
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,600
So, technically, I'm catching up to all the lost merch from last year.

226
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,840
For this year.

227
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,980
But put on...

228
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,260
Well, you should have thought of that.

229
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,360
You should have thought of that sooner.

230
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,080
Guys.

231
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,800
What kind of...

232
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,220
Guys.

233
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,040
A true Dragoon would have mortgaged...

234
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,580
No, don't mortgage.

235
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,160
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,540
I'm joking, guys.

237
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,120
Do not mortgage your home just to buy Doki Bird merch, guys.

238
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,220
I'm joking, everybody.

239
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,560
That is bad advice.

240
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,080
What I meant to say is that you should have gotten a loan from the...

241
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,700
I mean, no.

242
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,380
Sorry.

243
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,560
I'm also joking then.

244
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,560
That was also a joke.

245
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,480
What I meant to actually say is that...

246
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,500
Wait.

247
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:16,000
What I actually meant to say is that it's almost tax season.

248
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,040
And that means if you file your taxes properly, you're gonna get...

249
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,520
What do they call it?

250
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,480
Like the tax refunds and stuff?

251
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,440
Like the tax bonuses?

252
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:33,520
And so, if you file your taxes correctly, it means that you could use the refund you get from your taxes to buy more...

253
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,860
Tax returns!

254
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,460
Exactly!

255
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,960
So like, that's the whole...

256
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,600
That's why you have to make sure you do your taxes properly.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,580
So by doing your taxes properly, you will get tax returns.

258
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,040
And by doing tax returns, you can spend that on more Doki merch.

259
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,600
Isn't that like...

260
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,660
Isn't that what it's supposed to be for?

261
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,280
Like...

262
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,400
Nice chat.

263
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,720
Tax returns is already busy filling the hole from...

264
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,400
Will I save the tax event?

265
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,500
What do you guys mean?

266
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,260
I pay...

267
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,900
I will pay my taxes.

268
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,560
Sorry.

269
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,360
Not yet.

270
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,860
I will pay my taxes.

271
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,200
Hold on.

272
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,240
Hi, Doki.

273
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,340
Here's my tax return.

274
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,660
Thank you for the super chat, Green Tea.

275
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,260
Thank you.

276
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,160
Thank you.

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,120
I make good choices, everyone.

278
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,100
Mercy, thank you for the super chat.

279
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,440
Thank you.

280
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,880
Thank you.

281
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,580
Claim my merch as a business expense on your taxes.

282
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,480
Thank you for the super chat.

283
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:40,780
Thank you.

284
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,220
Thank you.

285
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:47,540
If I talk about the things I buy, technically, it is a business expense.

286
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,860
Because me talking about the things I purchase is content.

287
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,540
And I'm making content out of it.

288
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:04,420
So technically, if I talk about every single purchase I make, they can technically be the business expenses.

289
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,600
So today, I ordered Uber Eats for...

290
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,040
Today, I felt like eating some Hong Kong cuisine.

291
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:23,680
So today, for my Uber Eats order, I ordered iced lemon tea.

292
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,740
And also,

293
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,440
I ordered pork with tomato sauce on it.

294
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,100
And it costed me around $20-$30 CAD.

295
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,360
Because I talked about it on stream.

296
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,360
And I made content out of it.

297
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,920
And you super chatted me because you were like, That's a great story, Doki.

298
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,080
Technically, it is a business expense.

299
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,500
If you think about it.

300
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,200
You need to take a photo.

301
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay, I'll take a...

302
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,060
No, I can't.

303
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,000
I already threw it away.

304
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,340
I was gonna say, do I...

305
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:16,400
Am I willing to take a photo of my half-eating food and put it on my stream?

306
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,400
So I can write it off as a business expense?

307
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,500
I have the receipt, too.

308
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,400
I have the...

309
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,540
Very cool story.

310
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,360
Thank you, guys.

311
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,820
I really appreciate you guys enabling me to make very good decisions in my life.

312
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,700
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

313
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,600
Thank you, thank you.

314
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,280
This girl, when she finally makes it back to Hong Kong.

315
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,320
So I had some xǔ lǒng bāo.

316
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,280
And that's totally a business expense magic.

317
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,820
I needed it for my Twitter post and content.

318
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,700
Exactly.

319
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,840
Exactly.

320
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,320
Thank you for the super chat.

321
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,680
Thank you, thank you.

322
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,840
Wolfhound, thank you for the super chat.

323
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,460
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,220
That's a great story, Dokia.

325
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,200
Good content.

326
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,780
Exactly.

327
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,280
If the auditors see this stream, they will know I wasn't lying about my Uber Eats order.

328
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,940
I technically...

329
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,700
If I eat my food while I'm streaming, is that a business expense?

330
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,580
What if I just start eating whenever I stream?

331
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,680
Every time...

332
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,780
Because I'm eating my food to make content.

333
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:35,560
I have to have food in my stomach to have enough energy to make content for my business.

334
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,380
Minimaxing taxes.

335
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,000
Everyone eats to work.

336
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,300
Yes, but that's not their job.

337
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,720
This is my job.

338
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,480
Okay, how about like...

339
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,200
What if...

340
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
If I do grocery shopping...

341
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,540
If I take pictures of all the groceries I buy...

342
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,640
And then I post it on social media...

343
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,800
And also show it on stream...

344
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,720
Is that a business expense?

345
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,880
Because I'm making content out of my groceries.

346
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,920
What if I just make up a story about the groceries I buy every time?

347
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,040
I'll be like, oh my god, you can't...

348
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,860
Oh my god, you can't...

349
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,040
You wouldn't believe it.

350
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,620
But today, while I was grocery shopping...

351
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,160
Anyway, here's a photo of my groceries.

352
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Yes, I'm getting some...

353
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
How is that fried?

354
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,180
If there's a story that goes along with the groceries...

355
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,000
How is that fried?

356
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,120
I don't...

357
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,500
You wouldn't believe...

358
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,360
It's not butter, guys.

359
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,320
If you take a picture of the food, it's like you're sponsored too.

360
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,880
How is... I don't understand.

361
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,440
How is it fried though?

362
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm showing it on stream.

363
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,180
I'm making content out of it.

364
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,700
And you're reacting to my groceries.

365
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,980
How is that not...

366
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,700
How is that not a business expense?

367
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,980
I'm literally making money while I'm telling my story about grocery shopping.

368
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,420
That should be a business...

369
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,180
Every time I go do grocery shopping on the stream itself...

370
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,820
I do a review of the items.

371
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,380
And be like, okay, so I bought this today.

372
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,480
Do we have lawyers in here?

373
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,880
Doki's chat reacts to Doki's taxation.

374
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,720
At this point, just play Marvel Rivals.

375
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,820
Guys, guys, all I'm saying is that...

376
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,060
All I'm saying is that I make very good decisions in life.

377
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:49,860
LOL

378
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,000
Look, it's all about being an adult.

379
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,200
It's all about trial and error, okay?

380
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm trying to trial and error life right now.

381
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
Trying to figure out what is considered a business expense and what isn't.

382
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,120
I don't know.

383
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,940
Like, there should be like...

384
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,580
There's no like, frequently asked questions for content creators when it comes to business expense.

385
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,380
Because technically, I can make anything into content.

386
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,060
Like...

387
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,660
Like, everything I buy can technically be content if I post about it on Twitter.

388
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,300
Or show it on stream if you think about it.

389
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,380
Because like, I am trying to...

390
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,420
I'm telling stories about it.

391
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,100
LOL She talks about tax fraud in the stream title of Make Good Choices.

392
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,140
J1, thank you for the super chat.

393
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,140
Thank you, thank you.

394
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,260
Doki, stop.

395
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,900
My CPA certificate is curling up in fear.

396
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Gana, thank you for the super chat.

397
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,340
Thank you, thank you.

398
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,580
Okay, anyway.

399
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,440
Story time.

400
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,640
Story time.

401
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,600
Not about like, tax fraud or anything.

402
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,220
But like, I just realized...

403
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,680
Okay, so...

404
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,400
Doki Amber Doge, dad, has had this like...

405
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,660
Has had this issue where he keeps like, kicking his blankets.

406
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,420
Okay, so I let dad sleep with me.

407
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,460
I let Doki Amber Doge sleep with me.

408
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,860
And so, we have two blankets.

409
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,240
And we have like, one is like, his favorite blanket.

410
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,680
But every time I like, leave to like...

411
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,220
I leave, you know, to my office to do work stuff.

412
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,660
And I come back, he like, kicks a blanket to the floor.

413
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,800
And then sleeps on the fucking floor.

414
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,900
Like a...

415
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,760
Like a fucking...

416
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,060
Like a caveman.

417
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,980
I don't understand.

418
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,360
I was like, why are you...

419
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,120
Are you homeless?

420
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,500
You're not homeless.

421
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,400
You have a fucking bed.

422
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,400
Why are you sleeping on the floor?

423
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,220
Like...

424
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,960
I work so hard, so you can live like this.

425
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,740
Why are you sleeping on the floor?

426
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,080
Like an animal.

427
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,380
He is a king in the palace.

428
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,840
Why...

429
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,740
I was like, why are you like this?

430
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,260
I make so much money, so you don't live like this.

431
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,820
What do you want to be like?

432
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,700
I was like, do you want to be poor?

433
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,100
What's wrong with you?

434
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,700
And he does that like every other day.

435
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,340
Like, I...

436
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,560
My mattress is an expensive mattress.

437
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,940
It's nice and soft.

438
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,140
And he would just kick the blanket.

439
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,340
And just...

440
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,620
Floor, good.

441
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,320
Say humble, my goat.

442
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,700
So like...

443
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,940
And then I would like come back.

444
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,300
And then I just see like...

445
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,960
I just see him like uncurled...

446
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,880
Like curled up underneath the blanket.

447
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,560
On the floor.

448
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,000
And I always have to like place the blanket back on the bed.

449
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,640
It's so annoying.

450
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,360
I just... I don't understand.

451
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,720
Bed hot.

452
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,380
It's not even cool.

453
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,860
It's carpeted.

454
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,000
The floor is...

455
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,460
It's not like it's an improvement.

456
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,920
The floor is carpeted and everything.

457
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,780
So it's not cooler.

458
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,760
It's...

459
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,660
And he's under the blanket.

460
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,180
He's under the blanket.

461
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,180
So he's making himself hot anyway.

462
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,360
He's...

463
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,280
Carpet.

464
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,060
Good.

465
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,640
It's not like he's like...

466
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,020
On top of the blanket.

467
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,640
He's like curled up.

468
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,820
Under the blanket too.

469
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,460
So it's not like it's cooler down there.

470
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,380
Yabby, thank you for the super chat.

471
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,180
Thank you, thank you.

472
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,860
That is a hot conversation.

473
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,580
He likes a hard bed.

474
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,520
Thank you for the super chat.

475
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,360
Thank you, thank you.

476
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,160
You wouldn't get it, Doki.

477
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,040
You're not like...

478
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,400
You're not one of the people.

479
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,140
But yeah, anyway.

480
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,240
That's basically...

481
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,080
It's a very short story time about Dad today.

482
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,840
Just cause like...

483
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,040
Also, I'm really proud of myself.

484
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Because before the stream, I spent like...

485
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,200
I spent like two to three hours just cleaning my apartment.

486
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,240
And I actually vacuumed my...

487
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,900
I actually vacuumed my floors today.

488
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,920
When was the last time I vacuumed?

489
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,480
Don't worry about it.

490
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,880
But I did it.

491
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,620
Two hours is all...

492
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,380
Look.

493
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,160
Guys.

494
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
That was a long time of cleaning for me.

495
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,200
Okay?

496
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
Like, I'm not used to it.

497
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,120
Okay?

498
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,080
Two hours was a lot.

499
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,040
Alright, guys?

500
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,580
It was...

501
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,300
It took a lot out of me.

502
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,580
So, anyway.

503
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,620
I also...

504
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,720
I vacuumed...

505
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,580
I also vacuumed the floors.

506
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,920
Not all the floors.

507
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,540
Obviously.

508
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,440
But just the places where I was like...

509
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,080
That's bad.

510
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,120
I was like...

511
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,400
I should really, really fix that.

512
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,520
And I actually booked a cleaning service on Sunday.

513
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,420
To actually clean my apartment.

514
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,600
Because it's not looking the greatest right now.

515
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,220
So like...

516
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,700
So now...

517
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,280
Look, I had two hours.

518
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,680
Do you really think I could get everything cleaned in two hours?

519
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,280
Guys!

520
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,020
It was either I not stream today...

521
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,980
Or...

522
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
Spend...

523
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,400
Half a day.

524
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,260
Not the whole day.

525
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
Like, I know my limits, guys.

526
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,520
I was like...

527
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,980
Is half a day too much?

528
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,560
I was like...

529
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,020
Maybe not half a day.

530
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,220
That seems a lot too.

531
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,100
Anyway.

532
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,020
Half a day to clean my place.

533
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,160
Anyway.

534
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:30,880
Alright.

535
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,620
Anyway.

536
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,160
So...

537
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,560
You shouldn't have streamed.

538
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

539
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,140
I'm sorry for trying to fucking have a career.

540
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,080
You know how I need to pay the cleaners?

541
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,380
By streaming.

542
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,860
I'm at this fucking loop where...

543
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,600
To pay the cleaners...

544
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,660
I have to be able to stream...

545
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,480
So I can make enough money...

546
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,940
To pay for cleaners.

547
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,880
So I don't have time...

548
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,660
To clean my own home.

549
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,680
Because I'm trying to make money.

550
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
So because I don't have time...

551
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,860
To clean my own home...

552
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,680
I have to hire cleaners.

553
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,280
But then I need money.

554
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,860
So I have to stream.

555
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,520
And it's a never ending fucking cycle.

556
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,620
It's a...

557
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,440
Oh yeah.

558
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,260
And the cleaners are gonna be my business expense.

559
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,820
Cause I'm gonna make a story out of them.

560
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,260
So I can write them off as a tax return.

561
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,020
Capitalism.

562
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,020
Life is a prison.

563
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,020
Anyway.

564
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,320
That's just life.

565
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,960
CF.

566
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,760
Thank you for the super chat.

567
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,320
Thank you.

568
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,980
Thank you.

569
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,560
Are you live streaming the cleaners?

570
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,200
Does it count?

571
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,300
That's what I was...

572
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,140
Oh my god.

573
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,460
Do you think that's why XQC was streaming while cleaners were in his room?

574
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,460
So he could...

575
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:49,720
Because...

576
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,000
So he made the cleaners his content.

577
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,700
And because he made the cleaners his content...

578
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,580
He was able to write them off as a business expense.

579
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,840
Oh my god.

580
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,580
That is so smart.

581
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,460
I...

582
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,520
That is...

583
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,280
That is so fucking smart.

584
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,640
Oh my god.

585
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,080
He might be smarter than we all thought he was.

586
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,720
We cracked the code.

587
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,340
Okay.

588
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,700
What if...

589
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:14,980
Okay.

590
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,360
But like what if...

591
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,300
I pretend to stream...

592
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,720
And I put in like...

593
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,520
I push...

594
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,940
Play a video...

595
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,540
Of like sound effects of people cleaning my room.

596
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,720
So I can pretend that that's them.

597
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,260
So it's not like doxworthy for me.

598
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,420
And then I can write it off as a business expense.

599
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,040
So it's like they're here.

600
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,800
Like...

601
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,720
Wait.

602
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,740
That's illegal.

603
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,140
Okay.

604
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,940
But like...

605
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,780
Wait.

606
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,840
Why would the CRA...

607
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,160
By the way, that's the IRS for Canada.

608
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,640
Why would the CRA even watch this stream?

609
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,140
Who's gonna rat me out?

610
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,260
Who's gonna...

611
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,100
I don't have...

612
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,380
Okay.

613
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,860
Who in chat actually works for the CRA?

614
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,420
The Canadian Revenue Agency.

615
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,760
Guys, I need to know.

616
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,020
Can anyone in my chat tell me if they work at the CRA?

617
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,620
Who said that?

618
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:04,980
Me?

619
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Okay, goodbye, Yen.

620
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,380
I'm gonna...

621
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:10,920
Goodbye.

622
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,840
I can...

623
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,820
I can time...

624
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,580
It's okay.

625
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,800
The CRA cannot watch me anymore.

626
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,300
If they're banned from my chat...

627
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,540
Wait, I'm not Canadian.

628
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,340
I was...

629
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,460
I was kidding.

630
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,480
Look, alright.

631
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,520
Guys, it was that easy.

632
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,140
If I find out you work for the CRA, I'm gonna...

633
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,700
I'll make sure you...

634
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,480
I'll make sure you can't watch this anymore.

635
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,880
I don't think that's a good...

636
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,340
Real...

637
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,540
An undercover cop has to tell you if they're...

638
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,360
Exactly.

639
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,220
If I ask you, you have to tell me if you're a cop.

640
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,120
Okay, guys?

641
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,620
Yeah, he's not gonna be in the office any longer.

642
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,920
What the fuck is Justin gonna do to me?

643
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,620
Be careful about that, Doki.

644
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,040
Those cleaners will unionize at some point.

645
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,200
Thank you for the super chat.

646
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:07,840
Thank you.

647
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,460
Sounds like a good way to...

648
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,160
Okay, is there...

649
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,960
Are there any auditors in my chat as well?

650
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,900
Are there...

651
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,540
If I...

652
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:21,960
Wow!

653
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,120
For all you auditors that are watching...

654
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,320
Oh my god.

655
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,640
Do you guys ever...

656
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,500
Oh my god.

657
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,860
Did you guys ever wanted free plushies of me?

658
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Because clearly you're dragoons, right?

659
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,180
Oh my...

660
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,180
It would...

661
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,500
Oh...

662
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,000
If somehow...

663
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,460
A CRA employee...

664
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,800
Or auditor...

665
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,880
Slipped their address to my chat...

666
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,180
My business email...

667
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,380
And then in a couple of months...

668
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,360
They received...

669
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,100
Oh...

670
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,320
They received some free Doki merch...

671
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,960
Because of logistical error.

672
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,080
That...

673
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,560
Wow!

674
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,080
Now that...

675
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,060
No, no.

676
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,500
Logistical shipping error.

677
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,820
It's not...

678
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,740
I'm not bribing anyone.

679
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,020
It's just a mistake in the shipping.

680
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,180
Because...

681
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,060
I'm just covering my bases.

682
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,900
If somehow...

683
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,820
Some dragoons received free items...

684
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,100
Then like...

685
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,680
Oh my gosh.

686
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,020
Wow.

687
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,960
You guys must be so lucky...

688
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,900
For like logistical errors to come forth.

689
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,340
I'm sorry for that.

690
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,520
Sure, Doki.

691
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,070
Anyway...

692
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,510
Time to make some good choices today in life.

693
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,470
Anyway, let's play the game.

694
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,990
Speaking of good decisions that I make everyday...

695
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,070
Let's make some...

696
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,150
Let's make some good choices now.

697
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,270
I wonder if I...

698
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:06,790
Do I need to...

699
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,510
Okay, let me see.

700
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,810
Look sensitivity.

701
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:09,910
Alright.

702
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,590
I don't know how I found this game.

703
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,790
I don't know how...

704
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,550
Oh, what happened?

705
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,190
Oh yeah, for those who thought that I would be showing up to LM's birthday today...

706
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,390
I told him that I was only free at 2pm.

707
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,230
And then he like...

708
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,030
The thing that I was supposed to do got cancelled.

709
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,170
So like...

710
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,030
That's why I didn't show up.

711
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,550
So...

712
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,770
That's why I'm here now.

713
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,350
I was gonna do a 5pm stream regardless.

714
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,310
I said like...

715
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,990
I can only show up before 5.

716
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,570
So that's why...

717
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,090
That's why I didn't show up on LM's stream.

718
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,230
Anyway...

719
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,090
Anyway, it's time to make some good choices.

720
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,090
I don't know where I found this game.

721
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,050
There's no sound yet.

722
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,950
There's no sound, guys.

723
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,310
We're just on the main menu.

724
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,990
I had this in my Chrome tabs...

725
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,850
For the longest time.

726
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,430
And I don't know how I came forth to this game.

727
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,850
I just saved it.

728
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,230
It was like in my tabs.

729
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:01,710
And I was like...

730
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,130
Oh, I should play this game eventually.

731
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,470
And then today...

732
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,910
Like when I was making a schedule this week...

733
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,170
I was like...

734
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,890
Oh, I wanna do it really...

735
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,650
I wanna do it one-off.

736
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,350
And I was like...

737
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:08,770
You know what?

738
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,290
This is the time to finally play this game.

739
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,510
Make good choices.

740
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,190
And it's just all about making good decisions.

741
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,930
Why is the street light even capable of killing me?

742
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,190
So all I have to do...

743
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,050
Is get across that street...

744
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,010
To go home.

745
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,650
And it can't be that difficult.

746
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,670
I'm gonna get some water real quick.

747
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,990
Let me get some...

748
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,990
I'm so fucking...

749
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,730
Oh my god, I'm so fucking stupid.

750
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,530
Okay.

751
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,690
Not this game.

752
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,590
But...

753
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,870
But...

754
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,530
I...

755
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,410
I made hot water...

756
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,470
Before this stream.

757
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,030
And I was like...

758
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,450
Okay, clearly the water...

759
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,090
Would be cold...

760
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,050
Like cooler by then.

761
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,030
And then I realized...

762
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,050
When I was boiling my hot water...

763
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:50,790
With my...

764
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:50,810
With my...

765
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,590
With my...

766
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,210
What is it called?

767
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,590
The boiling water thingy?

768
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,070
The...

769
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:55,870
The...

770
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,770
What is it called?

771
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,310
What is the...

772
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,070
The thing called?

773
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:00,930
The boil what?

774
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:01,490
The kettle!

775
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,170
The kettle.

776
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,110
Sorry, I'm fucking stupid today.

777
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,290
I...

778
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,210
Left...

779
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,470
The cover...

780
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,410
Open...

781
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,410
So all the water...

782
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,110
Evaporated...

783
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,510
While it was boiling.

784
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,470
I...

785
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,490
The entire water evaporated.

786
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,890
I was like...

787
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:25,410
How?

788
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,750
I filled that up so much.

789
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,550
Like I filled it...

790
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,430
I actually filled it like...

791
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,630
All the way...

792
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,830
Like to like...

793
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,170
All the way up.

794
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,670
And the entire...

795
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,890
Oh my god.

796
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,230
I was so surprised.

797
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,410
It's gone.

798
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,950
It's all gone.

799
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,590
It's...

800
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,090
I accidentally made it.

801
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,370
I accidentally had a humidifier.

802
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:55,950
Fire

803
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:01,490
hazard.

804
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,210
Give me a sec.

805
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,260
Guys, it's okay.

806
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,200
Everything is okay.

807
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,140
Everything is okay.

808
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,720
Everything...

809
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,000
It's okay.

810
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,540
I...

811
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,740
Okay.

812
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,640
Everything is okay.

813
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,960
Okay, let's try this again.

814
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,160
Alright.

815
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,520
The vending machine knew.

816
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,160
It knew it was coming.

817
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,560
Okay.

818
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,500
So don't get near vending machines.

819
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,520
I'll just walk straight.

820
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,580
Alright.

821
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,320
The scooter's battery emitted sparks before detonating and you were caught in...

822
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,840
Oh shit.

823
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,900
Was that a scooter also made by Tesla?

824
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,840
Alright, that's five.

825
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,340
I just...

826
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,140
Won't...

827
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,360
That was not the same trap.

828
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,420
I...

829
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:05,920
The...

830
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,660
I walked on the gas leak.

831
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,760
Okay, I'll just go this way.

832
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,480
What's it gonna do?

833
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,020
The trash bag?

834
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,340
Improperly tightened bolts.

835
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,460
Let the AC slide free.

836
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,860
And it chose you as a target.

837
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,140
Is Doki Landlord onto you?

838
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,420
Wanna pre-flush you?

839
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,940
Thank you for the super chat.

840
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,240
Okay, I'll just go far left.

841
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,740
There you go.

842
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,320
What's it gonna do?

843
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,460
This car's gonna explode, right?

844
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:32,900
Okay.

845
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,280
Okay, so there's two Tesla cars here.

846
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,020
Okay.

847
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,500
That's fine.

848
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,000
Now that I know...

849
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,480
That there's two Tesla cars.

850
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,520
I'll just go here.

851
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,900
So there was a gas leak on this road.

852
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,020
So, other...

853
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,980
Oh, okay, cool.

854
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,480
Okay.

855
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,900
What is this Tesla Avenue?

856
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,680
Shifting ground beneath the street light.

857
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,940
Did I just encounter an earthquake?

858
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,660
Where am I?

859
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,060
Where the fuck?

860
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,500
I just didn't get over there!

861
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,020
I didn't get across the street!

862
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,220
Okay.

863
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,900
There we go.

864
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,440
Okay, we found the pathing.

865
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,240
Oh my god.

866
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,580
Okay.

867
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,060
That truck...

868
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,860
That truck is a cyber truck right there.

869
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,120
I refuse to believe it's not.

870
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,440
There's gonna be a bomb from that door.

871
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,600
Wait, what?

872
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,440
What?

873
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,740
Am I gonna get seen?

874
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,740
Oh my...

875
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,260
Okay.

876
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,560
A corroded joint in the gas plate finally gave out just as you passed.

877
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,780
Triggering an explosion.

878
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,180
Oh my god.

879
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,460
Okay.

880
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:50,620
Alright.

881
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,760
I don't know...

882
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,300
I can't move him after he fucking gets his thing going.

883
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,460
Alright.

884
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,340
Just don't stand near that.

885
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,380
I'll stand in the middle.

886
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,360
It's the same thing?

887
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,420
What is the hitbox?

888
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,580
Love Final Destination the video game.

889
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Phantom Knight.

890
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,580
Thank you for the super chat.

891
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,160
Thank you.

892
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,060
Thank you.

893
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,200
Okay, it's fine.

894
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,860
We figured out the pathing though.

895
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,300
It's here.

896
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,420
Okay, so what if I...

897
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,740
Go this way instead.

898
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,780
And then I go that way.

899
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:36,010
A hidden defect in the car's battery caused it to over...

900
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,570
Thank you for the super chat.

901
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,030
Thank you.

902
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,670
Thank you.

903
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,150
Thank you for the freedom.

904
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,230
I will never rat you out, my queen.

905
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,970
I just woke up and I just hopped on the stream and the first thing I hear is...

906
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,270
Thank you for the super chat.

907
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:51,910
Thank you.

908
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,670
Thank you.

909
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,930
How many fucking Teslas are around me?

910
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,170
Wait, there's a trash can here now.

911
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,170
Wait, they block...

912
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,630
What the fuck?

913
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,510
They can just do that?

914
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,470
Oh, wait.

915
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,550
The scooter's gone.

916
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,230
That is so fucked up.

917
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,150
Are you fucking...

918
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,370
They changed the map?

919
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,510
How do I remember this?

920
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,870
No, I can't believe it.

921
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,030
No, they put the scooter...

922
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,280
Oh, wait.

923
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,660
The air conditioner's gone.

924
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
The AC's gone.

925
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,440
Okay.

926
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,080
Where do I go?

927
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,410
Wait, was this...

928
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,690
Was this the thing that fell on me?

929
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,170
I don't remember.

930
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,090
I don't remember.

931
00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:00,640
Wait, what if I go here?

932
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,900
No.

933
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,600
No!

934
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,720
A chain reaction.

935
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,720
Falling debris.

936
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,420
Loosen.

937
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,860
What the fuck was that?

938
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,140
Okay.

939
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,160
That's fine.

940
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,960
This cone is gone, so that means I can go this way now.

941
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,500
Oh my god, I don't remember.

942
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,320
The car's gone, so there's no Teslas here.

943
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,020
Are you fucking kidding me?

944
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,940
Oh my god.

945
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,240
Wait, the car's gone, so I can go here this way.

946
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,820
I don't remember.

947
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,380
I don't remember.

948
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,520
Wait, is this a Tesla?

949
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,120
Is this a Tesla?

950
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,440
Doki Life Simulator.

951
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,440
All the bad luck happens to you.

952
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,300
Yeah, I mean, thank you for the super chat thing.

953
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,160
Is this a Tesla?

954
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,260
I don't remember.

955
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,920
I don't remember.

956
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,740
Wait, that's...

957
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,300
That's the dish that killed me.

958
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,440
No, but if I go this way, this will kill me.

959
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:10,920
Okay.

960
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,350
Just don't die.

961
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,490
Oh my god, just don't die, Doki.

962
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,650
What's the worst that could happen?

963
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,270
Just don't fucking die.

964
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,330
How do I get across?

965
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,350
I just...

966
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,910
Oh my god, why can't I just call an Uber?

967
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,910
Where are my Ubers?

968
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,450
Just like this.

969
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,670
Oh my god, I can't remember all the traps.

970
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,630
I can't.

971
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,630
I tried...

972
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,630
The Uber would explode.

973
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,850
Have you tried making good decisions?

974
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,250
Wait, was it here?

975
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,250
Okay.

976
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,190
This car explodes.

977
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:11,730
Okay.

978
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,360
But I go this way.

979
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,200
I...

980
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,800
How?

981
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,680
How?

982
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,620
Oh my god, okay.

983
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,440
Okay, the car is...

984
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,200
Okay, this way.

985
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,680
I...

986
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,650
It's too many.

987
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,300
Okay, this way again.

988
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,480
Surely it won't happen.

989
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,440
It's like, oh, it won't happen a second time.

990
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,060
I knew it.

991
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,420
Okay, the car is gone.

992
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,180
The...

993
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,500
Oh my god.

994
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,970
Cone is the worst.

995
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:54,790
Okay.

996
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,530
The cone means it'll fall on me.

997
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,550
Okay, I get it.

998
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,290
I get it now.

999
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,890
If there's a cone, that means it'll fall on me.

1000
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:06,150
So as long as I don't stand near the cone, we'll be fine.

1001
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:08,690
Okay.

1002
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:15,950
There's nothing...

1003
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,270
Okay.

1004
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,370
That looks very safe though.

1005
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:20,870
That...

1006
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,530
That looks incredibly safe.

1007
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,910
Oh, there's a bike ahead, so I shouldn't get near it.

1008
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:28,390
Alright.

1009
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,540
What if I just keep going...

1010
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,500
Oh no, that AC is definitely gonna hit me.

1011
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,780
I have a feeling.

1012
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,120
Okay, no AC here.

1013
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,840
And there's no cars too.

1014
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:43,920
This buil...

1015
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:55,070
I was gonna say, no way this building is gonna crash on me.

1016
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:57,810
No way.

1017
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,030
There's...

1018
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,650
There's sounds like, oh man, we'll be fine.

1019
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,090
It's not like this building is gonna crash on me or anything.

1020
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,120
Oh, that's...

1021
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,130
That would be so ridiculous.

1022
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:16,410
There's no fucking way that's gonna happen.

1023
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,730
Okay, there's no cone here, so this place is safe.

1024
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,830
That would be so silly.

1025
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,270
Oh my god.

1026
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,190
Oh my god, this...

1027
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,200
Oh my god, this trash can does not...

1028
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,230
Oh my god.

1029
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,810
Okay.

1030
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:37,490
Okay.

1031
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,230
Oh my god, okay, that...

1032
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,110
That doesn't look like...

1033
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:48,250
Oh my god, that looks like a trash can with a fucking Tesla in it.

1034
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:50,750
I fucking...

1035
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,150
Ow!

1036
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,370
If I get near the trash can, it'll just explode.

1037
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:58,590
Okay.

1038
00:44:59,290 --> 00:44:59,910
There's no car...

1039
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:00,950
There's no bike this time.

1040
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:02,610
So I should be fine.

1041
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,230
And then there's no cone here, so I should be fine here too.

1042
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,690
And then...

1043
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,810
Okay, we go this way.

1044
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,550
There's nothing above me.

1045
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,870
So I should be fine too.

1046
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,750
And then we just keep going this way because...

1047
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:21,330
Oh, that...

1048
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,270
What?

1049
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:24,590
Run!

1050
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:25,330
Run!

1051
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:25,830
No!

1052
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,340
Where are the people?

1053
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,480
Where did everybody go?

1054
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,300
How would I know?

1055
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,650
Okay, we go this way.

1056
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,390
I'm so far!

1057
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,490
I'm so far away!

1058
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,470
Why can I not just walk to the left?

1059
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,510
I don't understand.

1060
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,770
Just walk two footsteps up right.

1061
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,010
Oh no.

1062
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,390
The aircon is gone.

1063
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:01,850
Does this mean it explodes?

1064
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:13,870
A cigarette carelessly tossed into the garbage and I wasn't there.

1065
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:18,510
Guys...

1066
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:22,730
Look, I'm all about like the scientific theory, okay guys?

1067
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:24,330
How the fuck would I know?

1068
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,370
I don't know.

1069
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,050
I thought it could be a smoking kills.

1070
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,290
Guys, this is why you shouldn't smoke, guys.

1071
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:36,670
Okay.

1072
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,790
Alright.

1073
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,410
We can go this way.

1074
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:44,970
Okay.

1075
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,650
We go this way and then we go this way.

1076
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:54,230
As long as we're not near that car, it should be fine.

1077
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,070
I...

1078
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,470
Oh my God!

1079
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,410
God, I'm so fucking pissed.

1080
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:06,770
I just need to cross the street.

1081
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,990
I need to get to the other side of the street.

1082
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,790
Is that too much to ask for?

1083
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,270
Does it sound like they're still there?

1084
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:17,430
I don't think so.

1085
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,130
I think it's gone.

1086
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,340
Yeah, it's gone.

1087
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,300
It's gone, guys.

1088
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:25,920
Okay.

1089
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,080
And then obviously, that trash can should explode.

1090
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,260
Fudge top, thank you for the super chat.

1091
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,180
Thank you, thank you.

1092
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,260
Skill issue.

1093
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,260
Okay.

1094
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,360
Unlucky, thank you for the super chat.

1095
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,220
Thank you, thank you.

1096
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,100
Lay in bed and turn two degrees to the right.

1097
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,760
Bedsheet explodes.

1098
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,440
Okay.

1099
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,680
Okay, so that trash can obviously explodes.

1100
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,080
And then...

1101
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:58,240
And then the traffic cones means that the light pole...

1102
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,380
This pole will fucking kill me.

1103
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,620
So what if I just go this way?

1104
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,120
And the car may or may not explode.

1105
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,000
But that's the risk I'm gonna take.

1106
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,840
Oh my god, I'm okay.

1107
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:12,740
Alright.

1108
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,920
Now, we go straight.

1109
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,380
Okay, but I could go...

1110
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:27,850
Okay.

1111
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:32,310
Okay, well now we know white buckets are dangerous, guys.

1112
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,950
Do not go near white buckets.

1113
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,410
Alright, now that we figured that out, I could go straight here.

1114
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:41,330
Because there's no pole here right now.

1115
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:44,430
So that means I can just go straight.

1116
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,650
And then after that, I go this way.

1117
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,830
Because that roof is gonna fall on me.

1118
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,310
And then I just go straight.

1119
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,810
And this will fall on me too.

1120
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,290
And there's an exploding Tesla bike right here.

1121
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,850
So I go this way.

1122
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:02,850
And then there's no way that would get me.

1123
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,810
Because I'm so far away.

1124
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,930
And then...

1125
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,350
What do I do?

1126
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,590
What do I do after this?

1127
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:16,870
I've never made...

1128
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,390
Oh, look up.

1129
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,490
Look up what?

1130
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,470
Where do I...

1131
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,570
Where do I go?

1132
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,630
Where do I go?

1133
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,890
Look both ways.

1134
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,090
Okay.

1135
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,230
Alright.

1136
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:34,690
This seems...

1137
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:37,130
Where would this traffic cone be for?

1138
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:39,050
Oh, I have to wait.

1139
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:39,930
Okay.

1140
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:41,870
What do you mean?

1141
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,840
I even waited.

1142
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,740
I waited for it to turn green.

1143
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,500
Okay.

1144
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,180
Okay, we'll just go this way.

1145
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,180
Okay, I forgot about the traffic cone.

1146
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,240
This is everything my parents said would happen to me.

1147
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,200
If I try to walk to my friend's house by myself.

1148
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:06,840
Okay.

1149
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,120
We go this way.

1150
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,340
We go this way.

1151
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,280
There's no cars.

1152
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,200
Alright.

1153
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,380
And then...

1154
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,320
Anything above me?

1155
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,000
No?

1156
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:16,740
Okay.

1157
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,320
And then we cross the street.

1158
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,820
Kyle, thank you for the magenta soup.

1159
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:22,460
I...

1160
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,640
I don't understand.

1161
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,580
I don't understand.

1162
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,280
Okay.

1163
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,560
Is this a simulation built by Elon Musk?

1164
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,920
Like, where am I?

1165
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,440
Is this why this whole area is empty?

1166
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,500
Am I in a fucking simulation right now?

1167
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,360
Am I?

1168
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,580
But where am I?

1169
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,780
Oh my god, there's a satellite dish above me.

1170
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,460
But then there's this.

1171
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,720
There's gonna be a fucking gas leak.

1172
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,340
I'm just trapped.

1173
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,140
There's nothing I can do.

1174
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,900
There's nothing...

1175
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,060
There's nothing I can do!

1176
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,700
There's even a bomb next to me!

1177
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,540
What does the gas leak pipe look like?

1178
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,720
I don't remember.

1179
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,220
What does...

1180
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,300
Is that the gas leak pipe?

1181
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,900
Wait, is this what the gas...

1182
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,480
Is it...

1183
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,460
Oh, it's cause it's rusted, right?

1184
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,260
If it's rusted, it's the gas leak pipe?

1185
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,140
Oh my god, you guys are so smart.

1186
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,720
You guys are so much more...

1187
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,560
I fucking...

1188
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,440
I hate life.

1189
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:38,760
I...

1190
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,800
Okay, if there's rust on it, it's the gas leak pipe.

1191
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,960
Okay, I figured it out.

1192
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,920
I figured it out, guys.

1193
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,200
If there's rust on it, it's the gas leak pipe.

1194
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,480
Okay, that...

1195
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,180
Eh.

1196
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:01,420
Okay.

1197
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,600
Fuck, okay.

1198
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,800
We go this way because...

1199
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,580
This cone is where the...

1200
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:09,160
I...

1201
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,380
There's an AC!

1202
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,380
There's an AC!

1203
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,700
There's an... I never look up!

1204
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,140
Every day!

1205
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,640
I don't look up!

1206
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,280
Kyle, thank you for the super chat!

1207
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,260
Thank you for the super chat!

1208
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,800
I just don't look up!

1209
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,980
Why don't I ever look up?

1210
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,200
I don't understand!

1211
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,720
Okay.

1212
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,320
Okay.

1213
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,560
A sand in the middle.

1214
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,820
There's no gas leaks over there.

1215
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,020
So I'll go this way.

1216
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,540
There's the vending machine.

1217
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,660
We don't touch the vending machine, guys.

1218
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,600
There's the exploding scooter.

1219
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,800
So I'll just go this way.

1220
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,800
Okay.

1221
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:12,730
Okay.

1222
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,410
What do you mean no traces of explosion?

1223
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,370
I'm literally living through it!

1224
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:31,290
What do you mean?

1225
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:31,990
What?

1226
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:32,750
There's lore?

1227
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:35,250
Am I dead?

1228
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,110
Is this my fucking personal hell?

1229
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:43,770
Is this my personal hell?

1230
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,270
No.

1231
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:51,630
Okay.

1232
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,080
Alright.

1233
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,840
Wait for the green.

1234
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,300
We wait for the green.

1235
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,540
There we go.

1236
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,480
We made it.

1237
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,560
Oh my god.

1238
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,960
Thank you for the super chat!

1239
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,140
Thank you, thank you.

1240
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,700
Grundy, welcome to the tomato farm.

1241
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:19,920
Welcome, welcome.

1242
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,460
I'm across the street.

1243
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,340
I don't even know where the...

1244
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,700
I forgot where the end goal was.

1245
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,400
Oh my god, we're across the street.

1246
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,980
Where the fuck do I go?

1247
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,000
I've never been this far before.

1248
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,260
He's just waiting there.

1249
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,920
That car was just waiting for me.

1250
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,700
Surely this humble bike won't fucking...

1251
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,220
Guys, it wasn't the bike, guys.

1252
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,620
Wow!

1253
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,760
It wasn't the bike, who would've thought?

1254
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,480
It wasn't the fucking bike, guys.

1255
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,320
Okay.

1256
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,980
This car is gonna explode, I can feel it.

1257
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,980
I can feel the explosion right there.

1258
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,200
Okay.

1259
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,920
Right.

1260
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,760
That bucket would explode, I know it.

1261
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,460
Okay.

1262
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,460
We cross here.

1263
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,600
And that scooter is gonna explode on me.

1264
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,880
Okay.

1265
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,460
Alright.

1266
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,780
We figured out street one, guys.

1267
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,940
We figured out street one.

1268
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,640
This is why you don't go outside, chat.

1269
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,940
The outside is so fucking dangerous.

1270
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,760
NotSoDeadpool, thank you for the super chat.

1271
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,480
I'm fucking out!

1272
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,320
But there was no one in the car!

1273
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,020
He waited!

1274
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,700
He waited just for me!

1275
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,360
That's so fucked up!

1276
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,240
That car waited!

1277
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:28,240
He could've drove at any moment, but he waited for me.

1278
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,780
That is so fucked up!

1279
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,200
It was planned!

1280
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,820
It was all planned!

1281
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,520
They're all out to get me, guys!

1282
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,360
I knew it!

1283
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,160
I fucked...

1284
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,140
I knew you guys called me crazy, but I knew they were all out to get me.

1285
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:45,580
No!

1286
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,180
Wait!

1287
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,300
Wait, I...

1288
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,180
I lived!

1289
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,320
I got an achievement!

1290
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,940
I lived!

1291
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,900
Oh, my God!

1292
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,540
There is a God!

1293
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,380
I'm alive!

1294
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,060
Oh, my God!

1295
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,700
Oh, my God!

1296
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,900
I defiled death!

1297
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,540
Wait, there was a person up there?

1298
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,800
Wait, what?

1299
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,940
I didn't see him!

1300
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,640
I knew it!

1301
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,260
I knew they were out to get me!

1302
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,720
I fucking knew it!

1303
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,200
Oh, my God!

1304
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,520
I defied death!

1305
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,220
Okay, that would kill me.

1306
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,820
Oh, my God, I don't know what the pattern is for this.

1307
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,060
I...

1308
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,460
That scooter would explode.

1309
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,020
I can feel it.

1310
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,740
I can feel the explosion on that scooter.

1311
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,340
Oh, my God, where do I go?

1312
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,840
There's an AC unit here.

1313
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,440
Oh, my God, I'm so nervous!

1314
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,000
I'm so nervous.

1315
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,440
Where do I go?

1316
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,440
What does the sign mean?

1317
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:19,290
Guys, it does not look safe, guys.

1318
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,950
It absolutely does not look safe.

1319
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:31,430
Oh, my God, I don't know.

1320
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,470
Maybe...

1321
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:35,070
Okay.

1322
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,450
Okay, these bikes...

1323
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,890
Wait, what?

1324
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:43,790
There he is?

1325
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,610
Where's the guy?

1326
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,150
You see someone?

1327
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:49,770
Where?

1328
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,510
Oh!

1329
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,610
Oh, my God, there he is!

1330
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:55,930
Oh, he's looking...

1331
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:56,830
Oh, my...

1332
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,210
He's gone.

1333
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,650
Oh, that actually gave me goosebumps.

1334
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,770
That actually gave me goosebumps right there.

1335
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:06,950
Oh, my God.

1336
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:08,070
Is that him?

1337
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,490
Is that Elon Musk?

1338
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,510
I'm testing out his test notes right now.

1339
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,830
Oh, my God, is that him?

1340
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,690
Actual Elon Musk.

1341
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,130
Oh, my God.

1342
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,070
The man works for the CIA.

1343
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:30,190
Thank you for the super chat.

1344
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,370
Thank you.

1345
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,330
Burrito.

1346
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,090
Okay.

1347
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:37,810
Guys, do you think those bikes are safe?

1348
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:39,070
Because I can't tell.

1349
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:44,110
I can't walk here because there's a fucking telephone pole in front of me.

1350
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:47,010
Oh, my God.

1351
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,440
Oh, my God, there's a trash can, guys.

1352
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,140
Guys!

1353
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,220
There's a trash can!

1354
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:06,730
There's a bucket!

1355
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:10,330
What do I do?

1356
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:12,710
What do I do?

1357
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,310
Do I just die?

1358
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,390
It's just a bucket.

1359
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,050
Okay.

1360
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,180
Who said that?

1361
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,740
Who the fuck...

1362
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,520
Who said that?

1363
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,340
Who said it was...

1364
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,520
Who said it was...

1365
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,060
It's a...

1366
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,000
It's a bucket.

1367
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,280
What the fuck?

1368
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,400
What the fuck I said?

1369
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,600
It's a bucket.

1370
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,800
It's just a bucket.

1371
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:51,900
SpookyMcPot.

1372
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,700
This guy...

1373
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,440
This guy...

1374
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,660
Told me...

1375
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,780
It's a bucket.

1376
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,480
It's just a bucket.

1377
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,980
Yeah, it's a bucket.

1378
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,520
So no one got it.

1379
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,100
Well, it was a bucket.

1380
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,880
Where's the lie?

1381
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,780
Oh, you're right, guys.

1382
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,620
It was a bucket, guys.

1383
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:29,520
It was...

1384
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,720
It was, in fact, a...

1385
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,480
He just forgot to put the word...

1386
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,880
Exploding bucket.

1387
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,240
He's just...

1388
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,200
They're not wrong.

1389
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,060
You're right, guys.

1390
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,260
Just forgot an important word.

1391
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,960
He just forgot to put exploding in there.

1392
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,360
Oh, you're so right, guys.

1393
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,560
You're so right.

1394
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:46,960
Silly me.

1395
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,100
Oh, I'm so silly.

1396
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,100
Oh, silly, silly me.

1397
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,560
How could I have not known it was exploding bucket?

1398
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:56,720
I...

1399
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,900
Oh my god.

1400
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,700
I didn't see the fucking pipe leak.

1401
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,980
This is the worst version of Groundhog Day to be stuck in.

1402
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,020
I swear.

1403
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,160
Jack, thank you for the super chat.

1404
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:10,840
Thank you.

1405
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,580
Thank you.

1406
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,580
Oh, so silly.

1407
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,900
So very silly.

1408
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,840
Okay, there's a satellite dish.

1409
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,040
Okay.

1410
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,680
There's the...

1411
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,680
There's the fucking exploding bucket.

1412
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:26,620
Okay.

1413
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,730
I'll go to this side.

1414
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,850
There's no gas leak over there this time.

1415
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:38,650
And I'll go to this side to avoid the scooter.

1416
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,080
Okay, I wait.

1417
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:43,900
I'm patient.

1418
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,440
Oh my god, I'm so patient.

1419
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,240
Okay.

1420
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,320
And then, there's the thing that...

1421
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,280
The satellite thing that would fucking crash me.

1422
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,340
And we go this way.

1423
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,380
Okay.

1424
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,760
Wait, there's no...

1425
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,480
No, there's the bucket.

1426
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,180
I see the bucket.

1427
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,160
I see the bucket, guys.

1428
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,480
I see it.

1429
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,200
It's right there.

1430
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,010
Oh my god.

1431
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:20,890
It's right there.

1432
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:23,930
There's no gas leak here, so...

1433
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:25,710
Should be fine.

1434
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:27,870
There's nothing above me.

1435
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:31,980
Okay.

1436
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,900
There's the exploding trash can.

1437
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,000
Is there anything above me?

1438
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,360
Wait, is that the gas leak pipe?

1439
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,760
That's not, right?

1440
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,660
That's not...

1441
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,260
Yeah, but as long as I'm not near the vending machine, it should be fine.

1442
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:53,640
Okay.

1443
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:54,920
Okay.

1444
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,080
Okay.

1445
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,260
I'm not near it.

1446
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,420
The worst that could happen.

1447
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,020
Oh, okay.

1448
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:09,260
Okay.

1449
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,700
That's good.

1450
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,440
We're making good progress.

1451
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,080
There's nothing above me here either.

1452
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,920
Anything above me?

1453
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:20,400
No?

1454
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:21,700
Okay.

1455
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,040
We're almost there.

1456
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:24,940
I can see it.

1457
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,060
I can see the end of...

1458
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,960
I'm making good decisions, guys.

1459
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,940
I'm making really good decisions right now.

1460
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,660
If I go forward...

1461
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,960
That's not the gas leak pipe.

1462
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,740
Expert, thank you for the super chat.

1463
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,860
Thank you, thank you.

1464
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:46,880
That's...

1465
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,120
Oh my god.

1466
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,720
I can't go through because there's that.

1467
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,180
And that's the fucking exploding trash can.

1468
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
I know you explode.

1469
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:01,070
Okay.

1470
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:02,290
Okay.

1471
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,610
That bucket explodes.

1472
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,110
So...

1473
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:10,110
If I just go straight...

1474
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:12,170
Yeah?

1475
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:13,030
Okay.

1476
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,910
And then...

1477
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,270
Go straight forward.

1478
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:19,550
It's a bucket.

1479
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:20,330
Yes, it is.

1480
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:23,790
Just a bucket, guys, right?

1481
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:24,950
Just a bucket.

1482
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:27,230
Nothing is gonna fucking kill me.

1483
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,590
And then...

1484
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:32,050
I go straight forward.

1485
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:35,410
Oh, I can't go straight forward because...

1486
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,150
There's this.

1487
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:37,790
That will fall.

1488
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:39,270
But there's a bucket.

1489
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,890
But where do I go?

1490
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:45,370
I know that explodes.

1491
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,150
I know that fucking...

1492
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:50,270
That explodes too.

1493
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:55,070
Oh no, where do I go?

1494
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,770
There's two buckets.

1495
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,840
Look at this.

1496
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,140
Look at the pothole.

1497
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:07,900
What is it called?

1498
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:08,420
What is it called?

1499
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,400
The sewer thingies.

1500
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,520
I don't believe.

1501
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,900
I don't believe that's safe.

1502
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,340
That cannot be safe.

1503
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,880
There's no way.

1504
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,280
There's a traffic cone.

1505
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,120
That's a landmine.

1506
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,020
That might as well fucking explode and then the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles come out.

1507
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:28,960
I don't fucking know.

1508
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:30,960
That manhole, I can tell it.

1509
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:31,800
It's like a little...

1510
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,760
It's like a fucking...

1511
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,740
It's like step on me.

1512
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,860
I'm a goddamn man.

1513
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,480
I'm a goddamn...

1514
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,540
I have a goddamn mind.

1515
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:42,200
Like, it's literally just screaming at me that it's a mine.

1516
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,200
Yeah.

1517
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,460
Thank God.

1518
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,760
Trust no one.

1519
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,140
Okay, I got an idea.

1520
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,530
Oh no, that fucking falls.

1521
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:02,110
Never mind.

1522
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:02,750
That AC.

1523
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:04,810
There's no way that AC doesn't fall.

1524
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:06,490
There's no way.

1525
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:09,130
Oh no, I'm trapped.

1526
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:11,170
I'm fucking trapped.

1527
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,350
Give it a chance.

1528
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,440
Okay.

1529
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,680
Okay.

1530
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:26,510
Oh my God, it's safe.

1531
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,500
What the fuck?

1532
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,200
Who's in there?

1533
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,120
Who the fuck is there?

1534
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,400
I don't feel safe at all.

1535
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,040
Music of death.

1536
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:52,660
It's like the music that plays in Final Destination before you fucking die.

1537
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:56,400
Oh my God, it's the Grim Reaper.

1538
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:57,600
Okay.

1539
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,540
Okay.

1540
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,180
Just gotta get across.

1541
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,220
Okay, that falls.

1542
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,920
That satellite dish falls so we can't be near it.

1543
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,360
But we can't be near it.

1544
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,360
Where can we go?

1545
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:14,440
Okay, we gotta go across.

1546
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,700
From here?

1547
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,280
We gotta go across from there.

1548
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,440
Oh, the music stopped.

1549
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:26,060
I don't know if I like the music being... stopping.

1550
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:27,420
Okay.

1551
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,100
There's nothing.

1552
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,140
Okay.

1553
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,700
Look both sides of the road, chat.

1554
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,500
Look both sides.

1555
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,080
Ah, yes, my Oshi.

1556
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Paranoid bird.

1557
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,020
They're all out to get me.

1558
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,260
You don't understand.

1559
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,740
They're all out to get me.

1560
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:47,820
Okay.

1561
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:51,280
No, but if I go this way, the fucking TV satellite dish is gonna kill me.

1562
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,900
Thank you for the very first super chat.

1563
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,220
Thank you.

1564
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:53,900
Thank you.

1565
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,110
Oh my God.

1566
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,010
Please.

1567
01:08:59,370 --> 01:08:59,630
Okay.

1568
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:02,990
Okay.

1569
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,240
Oh no, not the scooter.

1570
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,480
Not the fucking scooter.

1571
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,620
Not the...

1572
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,940
Where do I go?

1573
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:15,340
No!

1574
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,140
Okay, we go from inside.

1575
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,220
There's no way this building collapses on me.

1576
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,960
There's no fucking way.

1577
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:41,020
Oh my God, gravity physics has not hurt me yet.

1578
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:43,640
Oh.

1579
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,900
Oh my God.

1580
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,380
Oh my God, physics.

1581
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,280
Oh my God, I beat physics!

1582
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,380
Oh!

1583
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:57,520
Okay.

1584
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,660
Okay, I won against physics, guys.

1585
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,020
Oh my God, there's a car.

1586
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:02,420
There's a fucking car.

1587
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:03,360
There's a car.

1588
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:03,880
Okay.

1589
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:04,600
Okay.

1590
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,340
There's a car.

1591
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:07,960
Okay.

1592
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,320
Okay.

1593
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:11,920
We got this.

1594
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:13,540
Alright.

1595
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,180
We crossed the road.

1596
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,660
And then we crossed the road again.

1597
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:20,660
Okay.

1598
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:24,580
Okay, we gotta make sure that we don't die from that car.

1599
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,200
Okay.

1600
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:33,840
Okay.

1601
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:34,530
Okay.

1602
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:35,600
Okay.

1603
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:36,590
Okay.

1604
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,460
Okay.

1605
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:39,400
Okay.

1606
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:40,840
Okay.

1607
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,580
Okay.

1608
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,400
Okay.

1609
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,300
Okay, it's right there.

1610
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,980
It's right there.

1611
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:45,840
It's right there.

1612
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,120
It's right there.

1613
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,300
He's waiting for me.

1614
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:53,760
No!

1615
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,140
Who built the room?

1616
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,740
Who built this room?

1617
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,330
Oh my God.

1618
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,730
Who's the contractor?

1619
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:28,130
Who was he?

1620
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:34,590
Oh my God.

1621
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:39,950
Who fucking hired this contractor?

1622
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:47,410
You know Elon built it.

1623
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:49,110
Oh.

1624
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:55,570
Is that...

1625
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:56,050
I can't...

1626
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,610
Oh no, that's the gas leak pipe.

1627
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:01,590
Okay.

1628
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:02,690
Brick?

1629
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:03,610
Well...

1630
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,470
If it's brick...

1631
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,650
If it's brick, that means it kills.

1632
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,030
Pan, thank you for the super chat.

1633
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:12,650
Thank you, thank you.

1634
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:14,550
I just watched the MySummerCarVlog.

1635
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:20,410
Where Doki faced the last report map for 2 hours and 30 minutes.

1636
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:21,330
And now this.

1637
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,010
Good luck.

1638
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:23,670
Thank you for the super chat.

1639
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:24,730
Thank you, thank you.

1640
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:28,960
Okay, this is safe.

1641
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,300
Okay.

1642
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:32,400
I...

1643
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,480
I forgot to go around it.

1644
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,080
It's been so long.

1645
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,320
It's been so long.

1646
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,660
I forgot all about it.

1647
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,320
It's been too long.

1648
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,380
I've been trapped in fucking purgatory.

1649
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,060
Okay.

1650
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,760
I've been trapped in this hellhole.

1651
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:58,960
Only I can run.

1652
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:02,100
Guys, I don't...

1653
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,820
Guys, I know I can run.

1654
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,780
But when I start running, I start forgetting.

1655
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,900
You have to know.

1656
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,440
When I start running, I start forgetting.

1657
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,120
So it's easier if I don't run.

1658
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,360
It's...

1659
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,340
Yoshi, thank you for the super chat.

1660
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,320
Thank you, thank you.

1661
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,620
Kaboom, baby.

1662
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,460
Johnny and Deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

1663
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,760
Thank you, thank you.

1664
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,100
Osni, thank you for the super chat.

1665
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,040
Thank you, thank you.

1666
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,300
I don't usually do this, but I sent a super chat earlier.

1667
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:40,020
And I think it could help both of us.

1668
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,940
Thank you for the super chat, Osni.

1669
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,440
Thank you, thank you.

1670
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,440
Osni, thank you for the super chat.

1671
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:49,980
Thank you, thank you.

1672
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,420
Speaking of good decisions, I'm really fed up with my current job.

1673
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,260
I need to find a new one.

1674
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,580
Can I hear your most serious...

1675
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:56,660
Can you lock the fuck in?

1676
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:57,880
Thank you for the super chat.

1677
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,240
Thank you, thank you.

1678
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,200
Guys, I swear to God.

1679
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,100
I'm locking in.

1680
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,520
Guys, everything kills me.

1681
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,040
What do you want from me?

1682
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,420
There's a fucking bucket.

1683
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,040
Okay, this falls.

1684
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:15,880
This falls.

1685
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,200
This falls.

1686
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:19,720
Okay.

1687
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:24,560
Wait, where do I go?

1688
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,310
Are you se...

1689
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:29,870
There's a... God damn it!

1690
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:30,630
What the fuck?

1691
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:37,500
I can't get out of the first street.

1692
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:38,860
Okay.

1693
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,280
There's no AC anymore.

1694
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,120
I want you to be in a good news.

1695
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,460
You haven't filmed me yet.

1696
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1697
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:53,960
I can't...

1698
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:00,220
Why did the city go through so many budget cuts?

1699
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:07,640
Who made this city?

1700
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:14,570
This AC will kill me.

1701
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,550
There's the gas leak pipe.

1702
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:23,430
Okay.

1703
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:24,450
Okay.

1704
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:26,950
We built this city.

1705
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,030
Okay.

1706
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:33,750
Walk on the green light.

1707
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:34,750
Doki.

1708
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:37,650
Walk on the green light.

1709
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:37,970
Alright.

1710
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:39,090
Okay.

1711
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:40,410
Okay.

1712
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:42,610
Okay.

1713
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,610
What do I do now?

1714
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,470
Okay.

1715
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,110
Okay.

1716
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:50,850
Okay.

1717
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:53,410
Okay, there's a trash can.

1718
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:54,350
Okay.

1719
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:56,250
There's...

1720
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,870
I don't trust those red bins.

1721
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,410
I don't trust those red bins.

1722
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,850
Those red bins... It's just sitting there.

1723
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,650
It's just sitting there.

1724
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:09,490
There's no way it doesn't explode.

1725
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:12,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1726
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:13,110
Thank you.

1727
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,940
But like...

1728
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,680
Okay, I could walk around that, right?

1729
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,700
There's no way.

1730
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,080
There's no way that doesn't...

1731
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,400
It's just sitting there.

1732
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,140
Menacingly.

1733
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,740
Like, it's just sitting there.

1734
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:39,680
I don't know if I should risk it.

1735
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:44,890
Okay.

1736
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,410
What if I just go this way?

1737
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:50,470
I go around.

1738
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:52,670
Oh, there's an AC.

1739
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,570
Oh, there's that fucking AC.

1740
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:57,930
Not all ACs will kill me, right?

1741
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:16,550
There's your ass.

1742
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:21,290
How was I supposed to know?

1743
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:25,250
I just... I don't know.

1744
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:29,290
I thought there'd be safe ACs.

1745
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,050
Okay, we go this way.

1746
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:37,190
I thought some air cons would be safe.

1747
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:40,230
Okay.

1748
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,270
That's a gas leak, pilot.

1749
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:46,310
Okay.

1750
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:48,950
Just go this way.

1751
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:51,950
And then...

1752
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,970
Now go this way.

1753
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:56,950
Oh, that was the safest.

1754
01:17:57,290 --> 01:18:01,310
The city ghost gets five big booms!

1755
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:03,690
Thank you for the super chat.

1756
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:04,290
Thank you.

1757
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,210
Boom, boom, boom!

1758
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:10,050
Okay.

1759
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:12,050
I figured it out.

1760
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,970
I figured it out, guys.

1761
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:22,070
There's no way that thing could hurt me.

1762
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,170
My god, I'm right.

1763
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:27,670
Oh my god, I'm right.

1764
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,170
What else could I be right for?

1765
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:32,030
My god.

1766
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:34,510
I'm actually right.

1767
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:40,170
Oh, but there's...

1768
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,950
Oh, is there a bucket?

1769
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,630
There's no bucket, guys.

1770
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:48,290
Guys, there's no bucket.

1771
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:49,990
Guys.

1772
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:51,750
Guys, the bucket's gone.

1773
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:53,830
Okay.

1774
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:56,050
Okay, there's no bucket.

1775
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,080
Bucket's gone.

1776
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,420
There's still hope in this world.

1777
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,500
There's another bucket here.

1778
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:07,420
Okay.

1779
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:15,720
Okay.

1780
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,100
We go this way.

1781
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:28,510
I'm so fucking scared.

1782
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:30,650
Does this fall?

1783
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:32,190
Does this fall?

1784
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:33,870
I can't tell.

1785
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:36,170
I can't tell if it falls.

1786
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,850
Oh my god.

1787
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:57,700
I...

1788
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,120
It's fucking sad.

1789
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,460
Okay, I figured it out, guys.

1790
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:11,080
Okay, the first street is easy.

1791
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,080
The first... I figured... It's the first street.

1792
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:13,800
I... I...

1793
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,440
Okay.

1794
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,060
I figured it out, guys.

1795
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,180
The first street, I know how this goes.

1796
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:26,240
I know how the first street goes, guys.

1797
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,540
I played these games before.

1798
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,280
I know how the first street goes, guys.

1799
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,820
I figured it out.

1800
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:38,000
I fucking figured it out, guys.

1801
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,960
I swear to god.

1802
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:53,170
Please don't understand.

1803
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:56,610
I don't understand.

1804
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:00,890
Where do I go?

1805
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:06,190
I don't remember how to play this game.

1806
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:08,130
It's been so long.

1807
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:10,790
Oh my god.

1808
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:12,250
Okay.

1809
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,730
The satellite dish is right there.

1810
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:16,410
I can go straight now.

1811
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:19,530
I should really go straight.

1812
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:21,490
Okay.

1813
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:22,950
No, no, no, no, no.

1814
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:23,570
I'm fine.

1815
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:24,910
I'm perfectly fine.

1816
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:25,850
Everybody.

1817
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:27,950
Don't worry.

1818
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:28,350
I'm...

1819
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:28,970
That falls.

1820
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:30,350
That falls.

1821
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,490
Oh god.

1822
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:34,630
It's a bucket.

1823
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:37,330
I can't get anything done now.

1824
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:39,410
JR, thank you for the super chat.

1825
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,810
Thank you.

1826
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:40,690
Thank you.

1827
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,190
Sam, thank you for the super chat.

1828
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:43,530
Thank you.

1829
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:43,970
Thank you.

1830
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:46,170
Welcome to Latin America, Turkey.

1831
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,270
Believe me.

1832
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,710
I know what I'm talking about.

1833
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:51,130
Thank you for the super chat.

1834
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:51,770
Thank you.

1835
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:55,810
Okay, we figured it out.

1836
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:59,130
Go, go, go, go.

1837
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:00,030
Okay.

1838
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:00,870
Sign kills.

1839
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:02,470
Sign kills, Doki.

1840
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,030
Sign kills.

1841
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:06,170
Okay.

1842
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:07,110
That's safe.

1843
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:09,010
That's not the scary bucket.

1844
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:13,670
There's an AC somewhere.

1845
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:16,430
There's an AC somewhere.

1846
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,890
I know you're around here.

1847
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,300
Not the scooter.

1848
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:31,660
Okay.

1849
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:33,240
Hug the wall.

1850
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,460
The scooter can't kill you if you hug the wall.

1851
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,320
Doki, please.

1852
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,260
Please, I'm going through some things right now.

1853
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,020
Please, I'm going through a lot right now.

1854
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,300
That kills.

1855
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,180
That's a sign.

1856
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,400
Oh no.

1857
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:52,480
Okay.

1858
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,620
There's a bucket.

1859
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,200
Okay, we go this way.

1860
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,380
The manhole.

1861
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:56,960
No!

1862
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,080
Why would they do this to me?

1863
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:08,760
Why would they?

1864
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,320
Why would they stop sparking?

1865
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:16,100
It was warning me.

1866
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,740
It was warning.

1867
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,100
He's like, look up.

1868
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,940
Look up, Doki.

1869
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:25,740
Look up.

1870
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:28,980
I didn't listen to him.

1871
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,180
Why did I listen to him?

1872
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,360
He warned you.

1873
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:41,560
He was trying to warn you, Doki, but you didn't listen.

1874
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,780
I didn't know.

1875
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:47,780
I'm sorry.

1876
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,140
I didn't know.

1877
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,820
Now he's angry.

1878
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,900
He's like, how could you not know?

1879
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,840
The signs were all there.

1880
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:58,680
Okay.

1881
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,520
Okay, we got through the first street.

1882
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,700
Okay.

1883
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,840
The AC is gone.

1884
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,460
I should be able to cross this way.

1885
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:12,400
It's gone.

1886
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:20,930
Okay.

1887
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:23,790
There's no bucket.

1888
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:26,030
Guys, there's no bucket.

1889
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,360
Bucket's not there.

1890
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,840
There's no satellite dish.

1891
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,960
I got a little paranoid.

1892
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,080
I had to look up just in case.

1893
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,240
I got a little freaked out.

1894
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,720
I had to be sure.

1895
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,480
Can I...

1896
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,820
Can I walk past the trash can?

1897
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:48,040
Is that possible?

1898
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,440
Can I...

1899
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,020
Will it let me?

1900
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,140
Will it let me walk past you?

1901
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:01,900
Oh my god, it let me.

1902
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:02,420
No!

1903
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,080
I was so happy.

1904
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,620
I was like, oh my god, I did it.

1905
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,240
I made it past the trash can.

1906
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,040
But it was him.

1907
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,260
The gas leak pipe.

1908
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,780
It was an ambush.

1909
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,200
The trash can was bait all along.

1910
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,120
It was just bait.

1911
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,860
I'm so fucked up.

1912
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,460
It was just a bait.

1913
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,820
It knew.

1914
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,000
It fucking knew.

1915
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,200
I hate it when that happens.

1916
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:58,120
No!

1917
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,400
I forgot what that car...

1918
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,680
It's been so long since a car exploded.

1919
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,320
I forgot what that was like.

1920
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:10,600
Oh my god, please.

1921
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,660
No, not the gas leak pipe.

1922
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:15,660
I forgot.

1923
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:21,340
It's been so long since I got exploded by a car.

1924
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,900
It's been so long.

1925
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,580
Oh my god, I'm so paranoid.

1926
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,260
I'm like, what is around me right now?

1927
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,120
There's a gas leak pipe right here too.

1928
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,000
There's a fucking AC.

1929
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:37,200
Okay.

1930
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:40,500
Okay.

1931
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:42,880
Okay.

1932
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:44,580
Cross the road.

1933
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,280
Cross the road.

1934
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,020
I'm so tired.

1935
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,880
I fucking... I'm dying everyday.

1936
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:55,680
Okay.

1937
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,560
Okay, I should be able to just walk straight.

1938
01:26:58,900 --> 01:26:59,300
Technically.

1939
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,120
Technically, nothing should kill me if I walk straight.

1940
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:07,540
Is there a bucket?

1941
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:08,980
There's no bucket.

1942
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,380
Guys, there's no bucket.

1943
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,180
Guys, there's no bucket.

1944
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:18,840
There's no bucket over there.

1945
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,040
Oh, there's no gas leaks.

1946
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:23,920
There's a gas leak over there.

1947
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:25,740
But there's no gas leak over here.

1948
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,940
There's a side like this, but that's fine.

1949
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,200
As long as I go like that, we're okay.

1950
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,080
Where do I go now?

1951
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,600
There's a bucket.

1952
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,420
There's a side like this.

1953
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:47,680
What do I do?

1954
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,260
What do I...

1955
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,080
What do I do?

1956
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,760
Can I cross?

1957
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:01,300
Can I just cross the road?

1958
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,760
Just like that?

1959
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,550
My...

1960
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:12,990
Okay.

1961
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:15,490
Okay.

1962
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:19,850
Okay.

1963
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:22,010
Okay.

1964
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:24,990
I don't know what to do now.

1965
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:27,010
I don't...

1966
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:28,850
There's a side.

1967
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:30,070
Okay.

1968
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:32,910
And if I go straight...

1969
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:35,810
Straight and then past this...

1970
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:38,810
Things will be...

1971
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:40,270
Alright.

1972
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:43,610
Okay.

1973
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:46,370
Okay.

1974
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:48,170
Okay.

1975
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:50,090
And then I go straight.

1976
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:53,910
Alright.

1977
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:55,290
Okay.

1978
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:56,730
Okay.

1979
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:57,750
Okay.

1980
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:00,270
I'm a broken man.

1981
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:07,310
I can't trust nobody.

1982
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,190
I...

1983
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:10,930
I don't know.

1984
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:12,890
I don't know.

1985
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:14,370
I don't...

1986
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:15,810
I don't know.

1987
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,110
This is a gas leak pipe.

1988
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:19,190
I don't know.

1989
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:20,930
I...

1990
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:21,370
No!

1991
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:29,960
It's the pipe!

1992
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:32,860
It is!

1993
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,080
It is!

1994
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,340
It is the pipe!

1995
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,120
It's the gas leak pipe!

1996
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,960
Of fucking course it is!

1997
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,360
What else could it be?!

1998
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,860
What fucking else could this fucking be?!

1999
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,020
Oh my god.

2000
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:54,760
Please.

2001
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:57,420
You built this!

2002
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,080
Who built this place?!

2003
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,240
Where's the inspector?!

2004
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,760
Why is nothing being inspected?!

2005
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:07,100
The revenge of the gas.

2006
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:08,500
Please.

2007
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:09,900
I just...

2008
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,940
Please, just let me go.

2009
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,580
Free me.

2010
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,000
Okay, there's nothing here.

2011
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:18,900
We can walk past.

2012
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:20,900
Is there a bucket?

2013
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:21,640
There's a bucket.

2014
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,320
They have a bucket.

2015
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,640
Sir, they have a bucket.

2016
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:34,680
I just need to hug this.

2017
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,500
Hug this and then go here.

2018
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:40,120
So I don't get killed by the side.

2019
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,240
And then after that...

2020
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:45,940
Okay.

2021
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,560
We go this way.

2022
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,340
And then we hug this wall.

2023
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,760
Milad, thank you for the super chat.

2024
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,460
Thank you, thank you.

2025
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,380
Coming into this without context is pretty hilarious.

2026
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:00,340
Listen to your paranoia.

2027
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,860
You can't trust nobody here in the city.

2028
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:06,420
Anything can be a fucking bomb!

2029
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,480
Nothing is real!

2030
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,760
Milad, thank you for the super chat.

2031
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,600
Thank you, thank you.

2032
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:12,640
Love is in the air.

2033
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,200

2034
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,760
Thank you for your favorite super chat.

2035
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:17,880
Thank you, thank you.

2036
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:18,860
The buckets.

2037
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,320
They're out to get me.

2038
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,300
I didn't even see anything!

2039
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:25,820
What the fuck?

2040
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,700
The sun was in my eye!

2041
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,100
That's not fair!

2042
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:33,400
It was the sun!

2043
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:36,040
Who the fuck let...

2044
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,860
This is why global warming should exist.

2045
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:39,000
Oh wait, no.

2046
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:39,620
Global warming.

2047
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,600
This is why we gotta make sure we fix the world.

2048
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,300
Look what happened!

2049
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,300
We have global warming!

2050
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,060
And look what happened to us!

2051
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,080
It blocked my vision!

2052
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,360
We gotta fix the planet!

2053
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,720
Or cause more pollution!

2054
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:04,000
One or the other can solve the issues I have!

2055
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:09,240
I'm gonna just start polluting more!

2056
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:14,540
Just start polluting more!

2057
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,060
Or fix global warming, I don't care!

2058
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,120
I don't care anymore!

2059
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:22,500
Bandit.

2060
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,160
Thank you for the super chat.

2061
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,260
Thank you, thank you.

2062
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,180
And they wonder why I don't go outside and touch grass.

2063
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,180
Damn, don't keep pickling.

2064
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,400
Whatever fucking kills the sun first, I don't care.

2065
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:37,500
Okay.

2066
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:39,380
Alright.

2067
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,800
Go this way, there's no AC here.

2068
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,000
Okay, everything should be fine here.

2069
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:49,460
Alright.

2070
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,560
We gotta wait, we gotta wait.

2071
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,220
Where is Captain Planet when I need him the most?

2072
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,420
Where is he?

2073
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:04,190
Okay.

2074
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:06,330
We can go straight.

2075
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:09,750
And then, there's a bucket.

2076
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,430
So because there's a bucket, I can go this way.

2077
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:13,630
Is there any signs?

2078
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:14,850
Anything?

2079
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:15,970
No?

2080
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:16,950
Okay.

2081
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,170
Any signs?

2082
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:22,190
Oh, fuck.

2083
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:22,570
Okay.

2084
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:25,970
Oh, this feels way too safe.

2085
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:28,330
Oh!

2086
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:31,790
Thank you for the super chat.

2087
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:32,730
Thank you, thank you.

2088
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:34,710
Air conditioner be upon you.

2089
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:37,250
Is there any air conditioning there?

2090
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:38,630
Anywhere?

2091
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:40,230
Anywhere?

2092
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:41,670
Can I just go straight?

2093
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:43,810
This feels way too safe.

2094
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:44,970
Oh.

2095
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:47,970
Oh, I felt way too safe.

2096
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:49,190
Wait.

2097
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:51,010
Why is there nothing here?

2098
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:52,890
I don't like that.

2099
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:54,610
There's not even...

2100
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:55,650
I don't like that.

2101
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,290
Why is there nothing?

2102
01:33:58,150 --> 01:33:58,550
Why?

2103
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:01,590
Why is there nothing?

2104
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:05,570
Don't like it.

2105
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,070
It's a trick.

2106
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:08,630
It's a trick.

2107
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:11,590
They're trying to make me have a false sense of security.

2108
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:13,370
There's no way.

2109
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:15,030
There's no sign here too.

2110
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:17,770
What the fuck is wrong with this?

2111
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:19,410
Who built this simulation?

2112
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:21,910
There's no sign.

2113
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:24,830
I don't understand.

2114
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:29,550
It's like they want me to just go forward.

2115
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:35,950
Oh, but I know what your plans are.

2116
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:38,530
I know what it is.

2117
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:39,430
There's the pipe.

2118
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:41,210
I know I see you.

2119
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:42,630
I see you.

2120
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:44,710
You think I forgot about you.

2121
01:34:44,990 --> 01:34:46,890
You put me in a false sense of security.

2122
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:47,850
But I remember.

2123
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:49,290
I remember you.

2124
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:54,270
I know what you are.

2125
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:01,090
I remember you.

2126
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:05,110
Here.

2127
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:06,030
No!

2128
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:25,560
I don't put...

2129
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,820
I don't put that there.

2130
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,960
Oh my god.

2131
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:35,960
Oh my god.

2132
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,290
Oh my...

2133
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:53,000
The AC and pipe were about to get me.

2134
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:55,560
They teamed up together.

2135
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:58,680
Get pranked, bro.

2136
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:03,560
Thank you for the super chat.

2137
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:03,980
Thank you.

2138
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:04,500
Thank you.

2139
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:10,260
All of this just so you can go to the doctor and learn about your impending doom from cancer.

2140
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:12,420
Thank you for the super chat.

2141
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:12,980
Thank you.

2142
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:13,940
Thank you.

2143
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,960
You're all out to get me.

2144
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,120
It's all there.

2145
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,520
Fuck y'all.

2146
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,800
It's all there.

2147
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,880
Every single one of them.

2148
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:30,510
I have to go this way.

2149
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:34,290
Oh my god, there's the bucket.

2150
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:36,350
There it is.

2151
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:39,350
Okay.

2152
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:42,050
There's the AC.

2153
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:45,790
Oh my god.

2154
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:49,930
Okay, I'm not rushing through that road.

2155
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:51,050
I'm not rushing through it.

2156
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:53,510
It's okay.

2157
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:55,190
We can do this.

2158
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:58,170
Okay.

2159
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:00,230
We made it.

2160
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:02,750
Just go forward.

2161
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:04,210
Should be okay.

2162
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:09,170
God, I can't see the fucking sun.

2163
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:10,310
The fucking sun.

2164
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,510
The fucking sun is covering everything up.

2165
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:16,480
Is there a bucket?

2166
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,380
Okay, wait.

2167
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:17,980
Is there a bucket?

2168
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:19,460
No bucket.

2169
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:22,500
No bucket.

2170
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:23,840
Free roam.

2171
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,460
Free roam.

2172
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:28,880
Okay.

2173
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:29,860
Alright.

2174
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:34,000
Sign there.

2175
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:35,600
And there's a bucket there.

2176
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,800
There's an air conditioner there.

2177
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:40,920
There's a pipe.

2178
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:42,860
There's a sign.

2179
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,880
Where the fuck do I go?

2180
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,600
What?

2181
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,320
There's a sign here.

2182
01:37:56,740 --> 01:38:00,840
There's a fucking pipe here and a trash can.

2183
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:02,980
There's a cone here.

2184
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:05,080
I can't.

2185
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:06,740
Do you not see the pipe?

2186
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,500
Between the pipe and the pipe.

2187
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,420
Where do I go?

2188
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:29,440
The trash can.

2189
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:30,980
It's gonna explode.

2190
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,060
Just send it.

2191
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:34,880
Just...

2192
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:36,300
Just try.

2193
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,020
They blocked the entire path.

2194
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:51,390
How the fuck was...

2195
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:53,960
They blocked everything.

2196
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,440
That was so fucked up.

2197
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,040
There was no winning.

2198
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,500
There was actual no winning.

2199
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,000
They blocked the entire path.

2200
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:04,800
It was rigged.

2201
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,620
I was not born to succeed there.

2202
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,140
The rich only gets richer.

2203
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:12,120
Everything was set up against me from birth.

2204
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:15,620
Okay.

2205
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:20,880
Alright.

2206
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:22,580
Here we go again.

2207
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:24,120
There's a bike.

2208
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:26,380
The pole will explode.

2209
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:28,400
There's an AC.

2210
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:38,590
Okay, there's a bucket.

2211
01:39:40,150 --> 01:39:41,310
Go this way.

2212
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:45,330
Sign is here.

2213
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:48,510
Okay.

2214
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:56,340
I gotta make sure I don't go to the side.

2215
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,140
Oh my god, there's the bucket.

2216
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:05,820
What do I do?

2217
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,180
What do I do?

2218
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:14,020
Wait.

2219
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:20,810
There's no way that AC can follow me.

2220
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:22,650
I'm on the right side of the road.

2221
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:25,370
Okay.

2222
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:28,590
Okay.

2223
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:30,650
Okay, this...

2224
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,030
This fucked up area.

2225
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:34,730
This area is so fucked up.

2226
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:37,530
This is like one of the most fucked up areas.

2227
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:39,410
Like, I don't know what to do.

2228
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:44,510
This entire block is out to fucking kill me.

2229
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:51,000
There's a sign there, so I can't go through.

2230
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:56,210
Okay.

2231
01:40:57,190 --> 01:40:58,830
I have an idea.

2232
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,780
My... and then I don't know.

2233
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:29,980
And then I don't know.

2234
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:31,720
That's where my idea stops, guys.

2235
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:35,660
That's where it ends.

2236
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,900
That's where my idea ends, guys.

2237
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,760
But what if this explodes?

2238
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,300
Okay, we'll wait.

2239
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,600
We'll wait before we cross.

2240
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:20,380
Okay.

2241
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:22,180
Okay, we're here now.

2242
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:23,760
It's right there.

2243
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:24,820
I see it.

2244
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,780
I see it.

2245
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:27,260
It's right there.

2246
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:30,180
It's all the way right there.

2247
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,620
Does this fall?

2248
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:38,220
I can't tell.

2249
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,360
I can't tell anymore.

2250
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,860
Does that fall?

2251
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,460
I don't know.

2252
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:48,080
Everything out is trying to kill me.

2253
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:54,490
There's an AC?

2254
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:57,950
Where is it?

2255
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:00,090
Oh, there it is.

2256
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:08,710
Oh.

2257
01:43:09,330 --> 01:43:09,850
Oh.

2258
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:20,650
God, and the moment you get to the end, the sounds on your back are insane.

2259
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:31,800
Where was the AC again?

2260
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:33,280
I don't remember.

2261
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:36,040
I don't remember where the AC was.

2262
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,180
This car explodes.

2263
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:48,920
There's no way.

2264
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:52,980
There's no way.

2265
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:54,460
There's no way.

2266
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:55,460
There's the AC.

2267
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,740
There's no way this is free.

2268
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,300
I don't believe it.

2269
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:01,360
I don't believe it.

2270
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,960
I don't think anything in life is free anymore.

2271
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:06,860
I don't...

2272
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:07,660
Oh, my God.

2273
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:08,780
None of...

2274
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:12,180
Why are there so many TV satellite dishes?

2275
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:14,760
Who lives here?

2276
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:19,460
Who lives here?

2277
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,690
It's one, two, three points.

2278
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:23,750
Oh, my God.

2279
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:27,880
Oh, my God.

2280
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,260
I don't...

2281
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:29,880
Where am I?

2282
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:33,840
Make good choices?

2283
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,320
It's more like make paranoia field choices.

2284
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:41,280
And a goofy ass simulator that runs on Murphy's Law and steroids.

2285
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:43,340
Here, thank you for the super chat.

2286
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:43,980
Thank you.

2287
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:44,920
Thank you.

2288
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:47,380
Oh, my God.

2289
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:48,320
Where's the code?

2290
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,000
There's the fucking code.

2291
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:51,320
There it is.

2292
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,340
There it is.

2293
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:53,580
But where do I go?

2294
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:54,420
This...

2295
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:57,380
There's a satellite dish and this bike explodes.

2296
01:44:58,720 --> 01:44:59,880
There's a sign.

2297
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:03,580
And then there's another satellite dish.

2298
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:10,560
No, is that a good fucking code or a bad code?

2299
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,080
I can't tell.

2300
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:13,360
I can't tell.

2301
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,040
It's not on the road.

2302
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,620
Oh, my God.

2303
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:20,460
Is that a bad balcony?

2304
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:29,300
Oh, God.

2305
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,720
Bad code.

2306
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,640
How would you know?

2307
01:45:32,940 --> 01:45:33,920
Where do I go?

2308
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:36,240
There's a satellite dish right there.

2309
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:38,560
That's gonna fall on my fucking head if I go this way.

2310
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:43,440
I don't know anymore.

2311
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,280
I don't know.

2312
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:52,120
I don't know.

2313
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,520
It's all...

2314
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,660
No, there's a bad balcony.

2315
01:45:56,980 --> 01:45:58,100
There's bad balconies.

2316
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,940
I found out there's bad balconies.

2317
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:06,600
Do I trust the code?

2318
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,240
Do I trust the code?

2319
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,860
I could go this way and go that way.

2320
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:13,320
But if I go this way and that way...

2321
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,040
Would I be safe if I do that?

2322
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,580
Is this a bad balcony?

2323
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:17,760
I can't tell.

2324
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:21,120
I can't tell if this is a bad balcony or a good balcony.

2325
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:22,120
I don't know.

2326
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,160
I don't...

2327
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:30,300
Imagine if a dev only bootstrapped the first two thirds of the game just to drive the people who play insane at parent...

2328
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,880
I don't know the dev, but anyway, just something I would do.

2329
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,400
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

2330
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:37,880
Thank you, thank you.

2331
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:42,980
Okay.

2332
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:47,560
No!

2333
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,620
It was a bad code.

2334
01:46:58,100 --> 01:46:59,820
Guys, it was...

2335
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,760
Guys, it was a bad code.

2336
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,540
It was...

2337
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,760
It was a bad code, everyone.

2338
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:11,340
It was a very bad code.

2339
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,040
It was a bad code.

2340
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:14,860
Guys.

2341
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:17,780
It was not a good code.

2342
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:20,740
It was not a good code.

2343
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,700
All codes are bad.

2344
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,800
Every code is bad.

2345
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:31,720
Every code...

2346
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,400
Every code is bad.

2347
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:35,220
ECI...

2348
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,320
ECIB...

2349
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:37,200
E...

2350
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:37,600
E...

2351
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,220
Why?

2352
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
So close.

2353
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,560
Don't trust codes.

2354
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:46,520
TD...

2355
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,780
DTC...

2356
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:48,820
Don't trust codes.

2357
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:54,850
No code was born right.

2358
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:58,110
No code was born good, guys.

2359
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:00,910
Every code is bad.

2360
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:05,050
Oh my god.

2361
01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:06,190
Oh my god.

2362
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:07,230
I'm so sad.

2363
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:09,610
I'm so sad.

2364
01:48:10,190 --> 01:48:11,690
Oh my god.

2365
01:48:11,770 --> 01:48:12,750
I'm so sad.

2366
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:14,070
I was so close.

2367
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:18,330
Okay.

2368
01:48:20,810 --> 01:48:22,090
Okay, here we go.

2369
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:25,050
I can just walk straight.

2370
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:27,150
I can...

2371
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:28,730
I can just walk straight.

2372
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:30,470
I can just walk straight.

2373
01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:32,010
I can...

2374
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:33,790
I can just walk straight.

2375
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:38,590
Why did they just let me do that?

2376
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:41,050
Why did they just let me do that?

2377
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:42,290
I don't understand.

2378
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:45,410
I don't...

2379
01:48:45,410 --> 01:48:46,570
I can just walk straight.

2380
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:47,470
I don't understand.

2381
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:49,210
What's in it for them?

2382
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:50,830
What's...

2383
01:48:51,290 --> 01:48:51,970
What's in it for them?

2384
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:53,590
Why are they treating me like this?

2385
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:54,770
I don't understand.

2386
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:55,990
Why...

2387
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:57,190
Why...

2388
01:48:57,190 --> 01:48:58,170
I don't...

2389
01:48:58,170 --> 01:48:58,870
I don't understand.

2390
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:01,690
Why can I just do that?

2391
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:02,870
I...

2392
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:03,770
I don't understand.

2393
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:04,730
I...

2394
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:05,950
Why...

2395
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:06,990
Why is it safe?

2396
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:09,610
What do they have planned for me?

2397
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:12,130
It must be a trap.

2398
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:13,530
It has to be a trap.

2399
01:49:13,670 --> 01:49:14,430
There's no way.

2400
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:22,390
There's no way.

2401
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:23,030
See, I knew it.

2402
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:24,210
I fucking knew it.

2403
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:25,470
I knew it.

2404
01:49:25,690 --> 01:49:26,170
I knew it.

2405
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:27,010
I knew it.

2406
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:28,050
I knew it.

2407
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:30,870
Oh, I knew it.

2408
01:49:31,010 --> 01:49:32,170
It's too good to be true.

2409
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:34,490
Let's go straight.

2410
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:38,350
Okay.

2411
01:49:39,910 --> 01:49:40,390
Okay.

2412
01:49:41,230 --> 01:49:41,710
Okay.

2413
01:49:44,230 --> 01:49:44,710
Okay.

2414
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:46,290
Okay.

2415
01:49:50,030 --> 01:49:51,330
Don't go through yet.

2416
01:49:52,590 --> 01:49:54,170
Don't go through yet.

2417
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:02,330
Is there...

2418
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:03,790
Is there anything over there?

2419
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:05,670
Okay.

2420
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:07,870
Is there any ACs?

2421
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:08,790
Anything?

2422
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:17,380
What?

2423
01:50:23,430 --> 01:50:24,670
It's self-moving?

2424
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:25,510
I knew it!

2425
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:28,390
I knew this was a town built by Elon Musk!

2426
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:29,650
I fucking knew it!

2427
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:32,470
And myself got a sick experiment for him!

2428
01:50:33,690 --> 01:50:35,190
I fucking knew it!

2429
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:36,070
I knew it!

2430
01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:37,650
This is what's gonna happen, guys.

2431
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:39,450
This is what's gonna happen to us.

2432
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:40,530
To all of us!

2433
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:41,850
I can feel it!

2434
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:43,770
Okay, we just go straight.

2435
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:46,610
It's a lie.

2436
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:48,350
This is what's gonna happen.

2437
01:50:49,470 --> 01:50:50,730
This is his big plan!

2438
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:54,350
This is what the Doge...

2439
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:57,310
Whatever the Doge fucking government bodies for.

2440
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:59,070
It's all connecting!

2441
01:51:00,630 --> 01:51:01,850
Oh my god, he's after me.

2442
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:02,830
He's after all of you.

2443
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:04,710
He's after all of us.

2444
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:09,050
It's the lizard people.

2445
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:12,590
Can I just walk straight?

2446
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:14,830
Is that possible?

2447
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:16,670
Am I allowed to?

2448
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:18,070
No.

2449
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:19,050
There's the cone.

2450
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:20,070
There it is.

2451
01:51:20,150 --> 01:51:21,210
I fucking see you.

2452
01:51:21,410 --> 01:51:22,750
I see you.

2453
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,250
I know you're there.

2454
01:51:24,530 --> 01:51:25,110
You think...

2455
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:27,030
Oh, and then there's the satellite dish.

2456
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:28,210
Oh!

2457
01:51:29,530 --> 01:51:30,910
What do I do?

2458
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:35,710
What do I do?

2459
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:50,350
Do I need air cons?

2460
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:56,430
I just...

2461
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:58,240
go straight?

2462
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:01,200
Am I allowed to?

2463
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:02,080
Do I have permission?

2464
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:04,920
Do I...

2465
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:06,800
Do I just...

2466
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,120
Is this a bad balcony?

2467
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:09,420
I can't tell.

2468
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:10,880
I can't...

2469
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,780
They're all so bad.

2470
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:19,980
This is what happened to the chimpanzee with neural link.

2471
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:22,060
Thank you for the super chat.

2472
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:23,020
Are you...

2473
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:24,080
Are you bad?

2474
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:26,700
Are you...

2475
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,240
Are you good or a bad balcony?

2476
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:31,340
I can't tell.

2477
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:36,700
Oh, there's a satellite dish.

2478
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:38,020
There's a satellite dish.

2479
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:39,180
It's gonna follow me.

2480
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:40,780
I'm gonna fucking die.

2481
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,660
It's gonna follow me right here.

2482
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:44,500
Right now.

2483
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:45,600
Where do I go?

2484
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:48,660
It's right there.

2485
01:53:06,810 --> 01:53:07,910
Can I do it?

2486
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:11,610
Hello?

2487
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:14,810
Where do I go?

2488
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:38,000
There's so many dangerous things.

2489
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:38,920
Which door?

2490
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:40,120
Which one?

2491
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:41,860
There's a left door.

2492
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:43,800
There's a right door with two buckets.

2493
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,220
There's two buckets.

2494
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:46,760
I don't know.

2495
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:49,120
Which is my house?

2496
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:52,980
This one?

2497
01:54:16,710 --> 01:54:22,610
I made 53 bad choices.

2498
01:54:23,590 --> 01:54:25,170
I fucking did it.

2499
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:26,690
Oh my god.

2500
01:54:26,710 --> 01:54:28,410
I fucking did it.

2501
01:54:29,550 --> 01:54:30,610
I can't.

2502
01:54:34,050 --> 01:54:36,350
I don't wanna go outside.

2503
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:37,190
Don't worry.

2504
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:40,050
Guys, I don't wanna go outside.

2505
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:44,190
The outside is scary.

2506
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:51,090
Oh my god.

2507
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:52,950
See you guys.

2508
01:54:53,590 --> 01:54:57,050
I told you I can make good choices, guys.

2509
01:54:57,630 --> 01:54:59,210
I told you.

2510
01:54:59,210 --> 01:55:01,770
Everything's coming to get me.

2511
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:05,370
I don't know what's good anymore and what's bad.

2512
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:08,850
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

2513
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:09,230
Thank you.

2514
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:09,670
Thank you.

2515
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:13,430
Imagine you're watching the stream in a public spot and accidentally disconnected the Bluetooth.

2516
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:16,290
People will think you lost your marbles.

2517
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:18,930
Thank you for the super chat.

2518
01:55:19,130 --> 01:55:19,750
Thank you.

2519
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:22,850
There's no such thing as good cones.

2520
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:25,290
Every cone is evil.

2521
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:31,570
There's no such thing.

2522
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:37,110
Every cone is evil.

2523
01:55:40,130 --> 01:55:42,530
There you go.

2524
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:45,090
Every cone is evil.

2525
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:50,160
Wait, no.

2526
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:52,030
Every cone is bad.

2527
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:53,440
There we go.

2528
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,560
All cone.

2529
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:10,300
Every cone is bad.

2530
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:14,820
Oh my god.

2531
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:17,200
That was so fucking hard.

2532
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:18,760
I was so paranoid.

2533
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:21,720
Thank you for the super chat.

2534
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:22,100
Thank you.

2535
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:22,680
Thank you.

2536
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:23,880
Let's go.

2537
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:27,480
Blasty, thank you for the very first super chat.

2538
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:28,020
Thank you.

2539
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:28,820
Thank you.

2540
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:30,780
And then a meteor hits.

2541
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,200
Try again.

2542
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,560
Thank you for the super chat.

2543
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:34,140
Thank you.

2544
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:35,100
Thank you.

2545
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:40,140
It felt really satisfying playing a game that lets you destroy buildings after this.

2546
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:41,600
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

2547
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:42,020
Thank you.

2548
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:42,800
Thank you.

2549
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:44,600
Oh my god.

2550
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:45,560
I'm tired.

2551
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,960
That actually took so much out of me, chat.

2552
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:48,720
That...

2553
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,540
What about ice cream, Doki?

2554
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:52,360
What about ice cream?

2555
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:54,820
That's why I only use cup.

2556
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:57,540
Guys, I actually don't like ice cream in a cone.

2557
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:00,200
See, this actually backs up what I say.

2558
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:01,660
Every cone is bad.

2559
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:02,740
This backs it up.

2560
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:04,180
I'm a cup type of gal.

2561
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,060
I always use cup for ice cream.

2562
01:57:08,420 --> 01:57:09,660
Oh my god.

2563
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,520
I have like mental exhaustion after that.

2564
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:13,160
That...

2565
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,180
It's like...

2566
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:15,060
I'm just like...

2567
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:16,360
Everything I touch explodes.

2568
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:17,820
Everything...

2569
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:20,560
What can I touch that doesn't explode?

2570
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,300
What is it?

2571
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,760
I was trapped in there to live through my personal hell.

2572
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,260
I went through it.

2573
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,780
Even when I thought for one time...

2574
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:38,140
One time in my life, I was like...

2575
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:39,320
Maybe this will be a good cone.

2576
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:40,040
You know?

2577
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,040
It's placed next to the pole.

2578
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:43,260
That's different.

2579
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,940
But no, every cone is bad.

2580
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:45,780
Every...

2581
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,560
They have no redeeming qualities.

2582
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:51,640
They were born bad at birth.

2583
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,380
There was nothing to save them.

2584
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:55,320
There's no reform.

2585
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:56,860
You cannot reform a cone.

2586
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:59,180
They were all meant to be bad.

2587
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:01,940
Magical.

2588
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,060
Thank you for the Akasupa.

2589
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:04,820
Thank you.

2590
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:05,660
Thank you.

2591
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,040
That was a good game though.

2592
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:12,760
I'm gonna call it here everybody.

2593
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,260
Don't keep...

2594
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:16,000
Can't say that.

2595
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:18,220
Is this the new merch?

2596
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:19,500
What if I make a...

2597
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,220
What if I just sell a black t-shirt?

2598
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:21,920
And then my...

2599
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:24,500
The only thing that's on the front is just...

2600
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:25,900
Every cone is bad.

2601
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:26,900
E-cib.

2602
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:29,160
No.

2603
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:31,760
The front will just be E-C-I-B.

2604
01:58:32,180 --> 01:58:33,820
And then the back will be like...

2605
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:35,000
Every cone is bad.

2606
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:37,140
And then like the front will have like...

2607
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:38,400
Will just have like a...

2608
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:38,600
You know?

2609
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:39,720
Like a cone.

2610
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:40,740
A picture of a cone.

2611
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,260
And then an X sign on it.

2612
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:42,900
And then...

2613
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:47,900
New merch idea.

2614
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,080
Zero...

2615
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:54,640
Like zero context.

2616
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:55,320
That's the one.

2617
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,000
We're starting a movement.

2618
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:58,800
Fuck cones.

2619
01:58:59,260 --> 01:58:59,700
Okay.

2620
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,840
Then uninstall VLC.

2621
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:04,260
Here, thank you for the super chat.

2622
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:04,880
Thank you.

2623
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,820
Thank you.

2624
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:10,120
Oh my god.

2625
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,600
Oh, this is gonna be my new...

2626
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:14,580
Guys, this is my new design idea.

2627
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:15,420
Okay, guys.

2628
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:16,160
For those who can't...

2629
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:17,420
Who can't visual...

2630
01:59:17,420 --> 01:59:20,080
Need visualization for designs.

2631
01:59:20,180 --> 01:59:20,700
Okay, don't worry.

2632
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:23,860
Alright, I'm drawing it out right now.

2633
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:24,860
E...

2634
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:26,360
C...

2635
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:26,940
I...

2636
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:28,180
B...

2637
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:30,040
And then there's the cone.

2638
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:32,140
And then...

2639
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:34,260
And then the front...

2640
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:34,860
Is...

2641
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:39,300
Every...

2642
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,000
Cone...

2643
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:42,860
Is...

2644
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:44,820
Bad.

2645
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,860
This is my million dollar shirt idea.

2646
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:50,140
Right there.

2647
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:54,760
This is my...

2648
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:56,960
This is my million dollar shirt idea.

2649
01:59:58,280 --> 01:59:59,240
I think I can...

2650
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:01,140
I think I can see this in Walmart.

2651
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:04,420
I can definitely see this in Walmart right now.

2652
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:11,540
So that's the front design.

2653
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:12,920
And that's the back...

2654
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:14,660
The back design.

2655
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,960
You can get it at your local Walmart.

2656
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:18,820
It would be...

2657
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:21,240
There we go.

2658
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:23,860
That's the cone right there.

2659
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:24,480
I'm sorry.

2660
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:26,000
I did this in pain, guys.

2661
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:27,240
I literally did...

2662
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:30,160
You guys counted how long it took me to draw this.

2663
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:33,520
It literally took me like 30 seconds to draw this.

2664
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,460
The cone PTSD.

2665
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:37,200
There you go.

2666
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,100
There you go.

2667
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:40,240
That's my million dollar shirt idea.

2668
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:41,820
My new merch drop, guys.

2669
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,920
What do you have against Doritos?

2670
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:45,840
I don't know.

2671
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:48,240
Maybe they should have made it cone shaped.

2672
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:51,360
I love that it's not even a cone.

2673
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,320
What do you mean?

2674
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:53,240
It looks like...

2675
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:54,320
It's triangle.

2676
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:56,820
How do I make it less...

2677
02:00:58,340 --> 02:01:00,440
How do I make it more of a cone?

2678
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:02,760
It's shaped like a fucking triangle.

2679
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:05,440
What the fuck do you mean?

2680
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:07,680
Anyway, guys.

2681
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,820
Before we end it here...

2682
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:16,780
Before we end it here, buy my merch.

2683
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:18,260
Before I go.

2684
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:20,640
Before I go, guys.

2685
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:24,360
Buy my merch, guys.

2686
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:27,160
I am selling my new plushie.

2687
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:28,800
It's live right now.

2688
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:30,640
Buy my merch.

2689
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:32,500
So you too...

2690
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:37,600
So you don't have to go outside ever again and encounter a cone.

2691
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:39,420
Where's the cone merch?

2692
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:41,240
Soon, soon, guys.

2693
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:43,420
Anyway, I'm gonna call it here.

2694
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:44,080
Everybody.

2695
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:45,740
As always, everyone.

2696
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:46,800
Stay hydrated.

2697
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:48,240
Posture check.

2698
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:49,700
Get up and...

2699
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:50,240
Wait, what?

2700
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:51,500
Get up and...

2701
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:52,420
Oh my god.

2702
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,400
Get up and move around.

2703
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:54,700
Sorry, like...

2704
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:56,480
I'm sorry.

2705
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:58,300
My paranoia is fucking me up right now.

2706
02:01:58,640 --> 02:01:59,800
Get up and move around.

2707
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,120
Get that blood flowing.

2708
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:04,640
And if you sit after me, head to bed.

2709
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:06,420
Because you deserve it.

2710
02:02:06,700 --> 02:02:08,180
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2711
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:09,940
Bye, guys.

2712
02:02:10,180 --> 02:02:10,700
Bye.
