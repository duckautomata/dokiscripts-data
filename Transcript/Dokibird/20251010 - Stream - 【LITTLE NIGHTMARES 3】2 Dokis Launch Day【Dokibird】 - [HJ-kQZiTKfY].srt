1
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,470
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,170
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,410
Ooh, I'm looking like I am lagging a little bit.

4
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,130
Okay, let me leave my session real quick.

5
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,810
I think it's because I put it on ultra intense graphics.

6
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,590
I'm going to turn down my graphics just a little bit.

7
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,670
Oh yeah, yeah, it's on advanced right now.

8
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,370
Okay, uh, highs.

9
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,230
Oh my god, but ultra looks so...

10
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,250
Oh my god, but look at the little small lighting it gives me for ultra though.

11
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,750
You know what?

12
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,150
I, oh man, let's look a little bit cool.

13
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,230
Okay, we'll do that just in case, just in case.

14
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,910
But, hello everyone, and welcome to Little Nightmares 3.

15
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,710
I'm waiting to see if Chibi is ready to call yet.

16
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,350
Oh, she is ready.

17
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,350
All right, we'll do the shill together.

18
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,770
We'll do that.

19
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,250
The sponsor opening together.

20
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,670

Yes!

24
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,400
It's out right now, guys.

25
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,800
It's out right now.

26
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,140
You can...

27
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,240
On what platforms are we able to get Little Nightmares 3, Cheeby?

28
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,360
Let's do a little test.

29
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,960
Was I supposed to read stuff?

30
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,600
Oh.

31
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,760
I've never done that.

32
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,800
Little Nightmares...

33
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,680
I thought the thought the thought was optional.

34
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,040
Sorry, guys.

35
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,960
I brought my child to work today.

36
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,200
She's still learning.

37
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,040
She's still learning her ABCs, guys.

38
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,360
She's still learning to read, okay?

39
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,320
So anyway, Little Nightmares 3 is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch.

40
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:25,620
And you will also get a free Friends Pass, and it's included to make it even easier for you to play with a friend on the same platform.

41
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,260
If I was watching this, I'd be pulling out my wallet right now.

42
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,580
Oh, my God, really?

43
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,640
You will spend...

44
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,520
Why don't you buy a second copy right now?

45
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,640
actually tried to in the game didn't work.

46
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,080
It wouldn't let me.

47
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:37,780
It said, oh.

48
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
I was like, you already have.

49
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,780
See, just get a new account.

50
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,580
Get a new Steam account and buy another copy.

51
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,620
It's just that easy.

52
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,260
You know what?

53
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,260
Buy three copies.

54
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,600
And then give two more to your friends.

55
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,480
Give a giveaway, yeah.

56
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:51,920
Just do it.

57
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,920
Just do a giveaway.

58
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,580
And by the way, or, but you don't, guys, don't work.

59
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,400
You don't need to have a friend to play Little Nightmares 3.

60
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,880
So they introduced a new thing in Little Nightmares where you can actually play with a friend right now.

61
00:07:02,980 --> 00:08:03,360
And that's why I brought my to work my dad to school day mom said your her mom said that friday was my day so um that's why she be here today uh yeah thursday's apparently my day even though we agreed that i see her every other year so i know yeah i know it's like this is my this is i'm so excited to actually see my dad like it's been a hot minute yeah the line at the store for the milk was was a lot yeah sorry it was you know there was a car crash and then you know um i had to really really yeah yeah so that's why i took a while and then you know i actually dropped the milk so i had to go back to the store and uh yeah second bottom milk and it's just it was just a whole thing to you and that's why that's okay i understand i'm patient and that's why it's okay that's why you you might have some Genetic issues,

I'm related to you, so I understand there's a little bit of problems.

63
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,940
Yeah, yeah, it's a little bit.

64
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,040
Anyway, but yes, even you don't have any friends to play with, don't worry.

65
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,220
It also comes in a solo mode with an AI companion.

66
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
So yeah, check it out, check the game out.

67
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,640

But yes, I am looking forward to...

75
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:16,350
I'm looking forward to playing Little Lumber Street Co-op with Chibi-Doki.

76
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,210
But yes, if you can check out the link pinned in, I guess, Chibi's chat and also my chat.

77
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,130
It really does help the stream.

78
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,590
What the...

79
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,190
What are you wearing?

80
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,670
Oh, sorry, sorry.

81
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,810
You can't even read.

82
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,990
Why are you wearing glasses?

83
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,390
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

84
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,930
Listen, listen, I don't have a tracking link in my thing.

85
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,850
So I'm asking my, okay, Chibi's chat, go to my stream.

86
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,230
Go click her link.

87
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,290
Click on my, you don't want me to give you my link.

88
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,550
I can give you, I'll help you out.

89
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,190
Give me, I'll give you my link.

90
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,890
Yeah, you can, why did no one join?

91
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:01,710
They're just like, why does like Chibi Doki have like zero clicks on her link?

92
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,650
Did she show up?

93
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,790
Like, what happened?

94
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,410
But yeah, so you click on the link pinned in my chat.

95
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,910
And I guess also CheeVe's chat, too.

96
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,610
And also that's in my description as well.

97
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,270
So yeah.

98
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,310
Have you played Little Nightmares 1 or 2 yet before?

99
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,730
Yes, I've beaten both of them.

100
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,290
Oh, me too.

101
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,050
I think I love the lore of the story in general.

102
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,230
Because it's so creepy.

103
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,930
And also, it makes you think about it.

104
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,450
Because it doesn't really have any dialogue per se.

105
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,870
We live in a society.

106
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,230
Yeah.

107
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,790
We do.

108
00:10:32,810 --> 00:11:35,570
do it's like so we live we live in a society yeah we live and um i do love the the lore of the of it's very interesting laura used to watch these like you know like those video youtube videos where they're like i did that like more explain little nightmares one and two and it's always it's always very interesting but yeah it's gonna be interesting to see what the co-op offers uh yeah yeah the last game had two people so it's like how is this gonna go and like we're with actual people and yeah and like you know this we're not i hope we're not as dumb as the ai's so i know i did listen i think we're gonna do a good job with our combined intelligence yes i think so i think so i think we are like at least like one iq point above the the ai bots that you can get you know well listen ai is smart so if we're one point ahead that's intelligent So like they're better capachas than I am.

109
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:45,710
Yeah, we have I suck at capachas We have a stopping point, which was like when we were 10, but like AI continuously learned We peaked early.

110
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,750
That's why we played video games very early

111
00:11:52,250 --> 00:12:02,410
But yes, also those are what this will be a short stream Because so we will only be streaming today for today for an hour.

112
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,650
Yeah But we'll continue it.

113
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,790
We will continue it next week, I think.

114
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,810
I'm excited.

115
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,730
Yeah, so we will continue next week, and it won't be an hour.

116
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,970
So we just want to let you guys know, when we just suddenly stop, like, what happened?

117
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,610
It's a teaser.

118
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,090
It's just a teaser.

119
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,050
So then you guys would be like, oh, I want to know more.

120
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,010
I don't know what's more going on in Little Nightmares 3, you know?

121
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,250
Yeah, and like, I feel like both of us were like super excited for this game regardless.

122
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,170
So the fact, like, there's no way we wouldn't play through the whole thing.

123
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,050
It's going to be a good game.

124
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,790
Like, the first two were so good.

125
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,270
That there's no way this one is an amazing tip.

126
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,530
Yeah, I'm super excited.

127
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:36,930
All right.

128
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,470
Did you select your costume yet?

129
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,710
There's cool.

130
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,110
How would you like to do that?

131
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:42,490
All right.

132
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,270
I caught dibs on the woman.

133
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,790
Oh, okay.

134
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,150
Okay.

135
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,470
I feel like there's a costume.

136
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,230
Yeah.

137
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,130
Cause there's a costume for the woman that's really good.

138
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,170
And I, and I really want to do.

139
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,410

Stupid question.

159
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,070
It's always through Steam.

160
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,790
What are you talking about?

There's a chicken?

Yeah.

171
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,210
Waiting for your friend to proceed.

172
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:44,490
All right.

173
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,790
If you see this, there's a band connect.

174
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,270
Uh-oh.

175
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,130
All right.

176
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,690
It can't be me.

177
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,590
I have fiber.

178
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,450
I love.

179
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,210
You got foot?

180
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,030
Yeah.

181
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,010
I have fiber.

182
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,310
Bro, I'm streaming as a career.

183
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,050
My career.

184
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,570
What do you mean?

185
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,290
Wait, what's your upload download?

186
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,390
What's your upload download?

187
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,650
Like 2000.

188
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,330
That's a fucking lie.

189
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,290
I promise.

190
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,510
No, I have like, like super cheap.

191
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,110
There's no way.

192
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,570
There's no way.

193
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,690
It's 2000.

194
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,870
Hey, I have something flashing on my screen.

195
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,010
I know it's not 2000 upload download.

196
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:16,990
Because if it is...

197
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,750
You want to do a test right now?

198
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:24,550
If it's 2000 upload download, you're literally like in the Facebook servers.

199
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,330
You're...

200
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,790
Download is 1,864, and my upload is 2,600.

201
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,510
Oh, it's still going up.

202
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,130
That is like!

203
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,470
2,2,225, it's still going up.

204
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,250
That there's 2,2245.6 upload.

205
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,170
Next.

206
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,490
Is it KB?

207
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,610
I used the Google search one.

208
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,370
Is it?

209
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,930
It's NBs.

210
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,310
Is it KBS?

211
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,150
KBPS?

212
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,250
No, it's NB.

213
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,850
No, it's a KBPS.

214
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,610
What is going on?

215
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,530
That's me.

216
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,410
That's you.

217
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,330
That's me.

218
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,310
That's you.

219
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,190
I like my hair.

220
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:02,730
Oh, you see?

221
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,090
Look at me.

222
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,970
That's me.

223
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,830
Hello, little boy.

224
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:09,970
Hello.

225
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,790
Hello, little boy.

226
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,130
You want to see my little collection?

227
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,550
Do you want to see my little collection?

228
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,510
Do you want to see my collection of baby teeth?

229
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,330
Open your mouth first.

230
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,650
Oh, I'll never do.

231
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,450
You gotta look at it to see what it is.

232
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,770
Oh, sorry, I tabbed up.

233
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,990
It's okay, I forgive you.

234
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,070
Wait, wait, wait.

235
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,470
Oh, my gosh, hold my hand.

236
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,350
Hold my hand.

237
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,250
Get back at it.

238
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,990
I don't hold it.

239
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,430
No.

240
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,410
Why would it?

241
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,590
No, no touchy.

242
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,390
Fix my daddy issues.

243
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,170
Fix my daddy issues.

244
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,070
Fix my daddy issues.

245
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,350
No, no, your daddy issues will never be fixed.

246
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,870
Oh, ew, you stink.

247
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,730
Let me walk that away.

248
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:53,470
You stink.

249
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,850
Ew, you stink.

250
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,210

I don't hear it.

253
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,970
How dare you enable this behavior?

254
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,030
What are you talking about?

255
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:02,830
You don't understand.

256
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,590
You don't understand what they're talking about.

257
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,770
How do I not understand?

258
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,270
I literally see it in the Discord chat.

259
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,470
Ah, Doki, where did you go?

260
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:09,890
You disappeared.

261
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,350
Doki, I'm right here.

262
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,110
Wait, I can't.

263
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,630
Wait, wait, wait, Doki, what happened?

264
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,590
Wait, you got taken away.

265
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,490
Oh, goodbye.

266
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,230
Wait a second.

267
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,630
On my YouTube studio, your model just went to the void.

268
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,410
Where did you go?

269
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,110
Hold up.

270
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,310
I'll give you a second word.

271
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,130
It's your call.

272
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,310
This is the double the dokey square experience right there.

273
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,330
This is...

274
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,790
Look, I...

275
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,570
My people need me.

276
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,410
You can't.

277
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,270
It's...

278
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,910
You can't fix me.

279
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:43,990
You're actually gone.

280
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,730
I know what I am.

281
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,630
I know.

282
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,970
I just went to get milk again.

283
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,490
Hold up.

284
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,790
Wait, what is this?

285
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:55,990
Oh, my God.

286
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,650
You actually...

287
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:28,050

Hold on, click and leave.

289
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,090
Don't make Daddy angry, Shibi.

290
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,650
Fix it.

291
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,170
Fix it now.

292
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:40,470
Okay.

293
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,230
Fix it now.

294
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,130
That's right.

295
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:45,870
Oh!

296
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,310
Go!

297
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,570
Your character is like actually deleted from you.

298
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,430
I don't know what to do.

299
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,790
It's actually gone.

300
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,910
What did you think?

301
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,050
You're still here on my end.

302
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,730
What did you do?

303
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,770
I don't know what happened.

304
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,270
If I click you control position, your model goes off the map.

305
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,950
What the fuck?

306
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,970
Like, look, chat, if I click you control position.

307
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,010
Oh, you must have accidentally moved me off.

308
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,470
Like, you must have had something, like, you know how, like, you buffer and then slowly crawl away?

309
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,390
I know, but if I try to pull you back, you don't come back.

310
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:26,750
from my stream.

311
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,370
Quick pause.

312
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:28,930
Wait, what's pause?

313
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,970
But first time?

314
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,770
First time.

315
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,450
Ordering.

316
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,610
Alright.

317
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,110
I'm gonna go.

318
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,110
She's not for milk.

319
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,870
But did I actually get ghosted?

320
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,550
I'll go.

321
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,230
There's no way.

322
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,470
I'll go progress.

323
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,790
Oh my god, there's a dead rat.

324
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,730
That's a good gift.

325
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,070
There's gotta be like a YouTuber who knows how to fix this.

326
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,010
You know what?

327
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,070
I need to look for a gift for Cheeby anyway.

328
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,670
This is a good gift right here.

329
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,010
Look at this.

330
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,370
Alright, goodbye.

331
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,230
Do I need you to progress?

332
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:55,890
I don't think so.

00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,730
Look, look, look, I don't think you paid for the premium experience, Sheeby.

335
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,230
No, it's just a premium experience.

336
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,570
The premium experience is where I actually watch your stream.

337
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:44,030
The normal experience is where you get someone on the Doki Bear team to watch your stream.

338
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,050

00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,550
Now move.

00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,930
Wow, look at her go!

511
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,810
Look at them, do you see the chicken feet?

512
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,670
What?

513
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,490
Look in the box, the little chicken feet sticking out.

514
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,510
Oh, yeah, there is!

515
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,190
It's dead!

516
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,150
Oh, wait, wait, what's over here, though?

517
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,930

00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,530
Wait, what do you have?

521
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,510

00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,850
Oh, he's definitely dead.

534
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,030
What?

535
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:42,890
Oh.

536
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,070
Did you fall off?

537
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,010
No.

538
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,650
Did you fall off?

539
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,090
No, I checked an Ender Pearl.

540
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,250
I got you something.

541
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,030
Oh?

542
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,010
Where did you get me?

543
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:58,970
Where did you go?

544
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,630
I got you something.

545
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:01,630
What is it?

546
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,990
What happened?

547
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,170
No, it's gone.

548
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,490
It's, it's, uh, it's gone.

549
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,750
You fell off.

550
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,050
You fell, didn't you?

551
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,150
We have to move this thing.

552
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:13,970
Where are you?

553
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:14,930

Oh, wait, there's another rope.

00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,410
Alright, it's time to do your special talent.

Alright.

Yeah, I'm ready to be impressed.

569
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,650
You ready for this?

570
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,980
That's right.

571
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:16,980
That's right.

572
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,000
I mean, I feel like your technique needs a little bit of work, but I guess that's our...

573
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,340
I've heard that before, actually.

574
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,120
It's okay.

575
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,340
You know, maybe one day you'll get it right.

576
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:31,940
Thanks.

577
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,800
At least you believe in the one day.

578
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,480
Well, I just say maybe.

579
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,860
Not like one.

580
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,280
I'll take it.

581
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,220
That's not that bad.

582
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,400
Careful, careful.

583
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,860
Oh, what's going on?

584
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,220
I don't know if you know this, but you can fall off.

585
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,160
How do you know that?

586
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:48,680
I would know.

587
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,960
I'm just trying to warn you.

588
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,120
How- how did you know that, gee?

589
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,380
Listen, it's- and it's also a really far flaw.

590
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,300
What is this thing?

591
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,980
Wait, can we grab it?

592
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,120
I don't know.

593
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,600
It looks like we can spin it or like attach something to it.

594
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,140
Thanks.

595
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,960
Wait, oh, maybe?

596
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,220
Hit it!

597
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,820
Oh my god!

598
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,740
Oh my gosh!

599
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,440
I knew I'm so smart.

600
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,540
You spin me right around, baby, right around.

601
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,560
Like a rock baby, right, right, right, right.

602
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,500
Ah!

603
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,280
That's tight!

604
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,370
That's so messed up!

605
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,010
Why did you jump left?

606
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,030
You couldn't jump to the right.

607
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,310
Why did you?

608
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,190
Why did you jump to the right?

609
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,170
Why did you jump into the pit?

610
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,650
Open the stick.

611
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,810
It's 50-50.

612
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,030
She better worry about you.

613
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:51,550
We're gently.

Do you care?

617
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,230

Anyways, move out the way.

621
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,870
I mean, it's all about equality.

622
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,330
Exactly.

623
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,110
All right.

624
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,270
I go up.

625
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,250
Oh, we need a key.

626
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,190
Oh?

627
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,570
What key?

628
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,090
Wait, there's another little thing you jump on.

629
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:09,430
Yeah?

631
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,910
Oh!

632
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,550
Yeah, we need a key.

633
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,390
One day, you will develop trust issues.

634
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,410
All right.

635
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,230
Sneaky, sneaky.

636
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,770
Sneaky, sneaky.

637
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,050
What do you think are in those sacks?

638
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,330
What sacks?

639
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,090
All these sacks on the wall.

640
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:30,850
Which one?

641
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,930
What do you think is in them?

642
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,530
There's no sacks in the wall.

643
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,470
What are you talking about?

644
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,390
Over here, these sacks on the wall.

645
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,130
What do you think is in them?

646
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,230
I don't see it.

647
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,250
You don't see the sacks?

648
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:41,770
No.

649
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,670
Where are they?

650
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,010
Oh, maybe like we see different things.

651
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,390
Maybe like, uh...

652
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,130
The walls are full of voices and like...

653
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,130
Yeah, yeah, cause mine is just a wall.

654
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,570
Wait, really?

655
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:51,930
Yeah.

656
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:52,970
Yeah.

657
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,670
Okay, but if there were sacks here, what do you think they'd be full of?

658
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,870
Yeah, but okay, describe the sacks to me.

659
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,330
There's sacks, and there's like a bunch of them on the wall.

660
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,550
Okay, what color is it?

661
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,590
Sack color, like brown.

662
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,230
Okay, what color is the sack?

663
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:10,990
Brown.

664
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:11,710
Okay.

665
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,390
Is it like one giant stack, or is it like multiple sacks?

666
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,870
Like, there's like 30 sacks.

667
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,530
Wait, you counted them?

668
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,350
No, like, I need to guess them.

669
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,370
Do you want me to count them?

670
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,170
Oh yeah, sure.

671
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,250
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

672
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:30,850
I'm done.

673
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,530
I can't do it.

674
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,230
It's like thirty.

675
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,710
Okay, but yeah, no, I see the sacks.

676
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,330
You do say, Papa?

677
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,130
Yeah, I see the sacks, yeah.

678
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,710
Okay, what do you think is in them?

679
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,190
I think most likely just bodies, right?

680
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:44,690
Probably.

681
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:45,570
Like, I don't know.

682
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,450
Oh, we just actually kissed.

683
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,610
I feel like, I mean, we just...

684
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:48,630
You're dead?

685
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,440
You know?

686
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,100
You

687
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:00,330
know?

688
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,390
Yeah, like...

689
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:01,990
Like what?

690
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:02,750
Like what?

691
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,150
I just accidentally kissed my dad.

692
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,410
Sorry.

693
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,070
We're on the next family, uh, the family cookout's gonna be really awkward.

694
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,490
Oh, hey.

695
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:13,930
Oh, hey.

696
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,590
Was that also an accident again?

697
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,350
Was that?

698
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,410
Oh, we just did it again.

699
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,030
I don't think it's an accident anymore.

700
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,150
All right.

701
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,090
Oh, excuse me.

702
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,450
Oh, whoa.

703
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,710
Excuse me.

704
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:26,230
Oh.

705
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:26,910
Oh.

706
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,190
Oh.

707
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,210
Oh.

708
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:29,230
Oh.

709
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,270
Oh.

710
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,890
You okay there?

711
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,630
You okay there?

712
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,770
This is...

713
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:39,170
I need feather falling.

714
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,790
Try to figure out what to do.

715
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,270
Oh yeah, we're supposed to do stuff.

716
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,690
Can we climb the sacks?

717
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:46,710
No.

718
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:47,570
Oh!

719
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,230
I just think it's happening to my left.

720
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,930
It's time to shoot.

721
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,350
Alright, you get on that.

722
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,330
Alright.

723
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,730
Never heard a woman say that in their mind.

724
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,110
Yeah.

725
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:57,370
Okay.

726
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:58,890
Alright.

727
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,990
Jump on it.

728
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,410
Okay.

729
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,210
Sorry, I'm violent.

730
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:02,710
I'm violent.

731
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,150
Alright.

732
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,590
And then I'm going to take you.

733
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,170
I'm going to... My people need me.

734
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,770
Yeah, I'm going to take you to where your people need you.

735
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,130
Wait, no, no, no!

736
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,090
Are you ready?

737
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:11,530
I'm scared.

738
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,130
Okay, I'm scared.

739
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,030
Go slow.

740
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,970
I believe in you.

741
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:16,370
Okay.

742
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,650
I believe in you.

743
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,990
You gotta...

744
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,690
You gotta be a brave little girl now, Cheeby.

745
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,010
This is where you're gonna start growing up now.

746
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,750
What do you see up here?

747
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:27,970
It's a lever.

748
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,590
There's a lever.

749
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,950
Alright, turn on that lever.

750
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,210
Boom!

751
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,070
What did you do?

752
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,050
It descended an escalator.

753
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,390
An escalator?

754
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,410
Where?

755
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,510
Here, I'll descend it right here.

756
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,010
Oh, okay.

757
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,610
In front of the sack wall.

758
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:47,330
Oh, I see.

759
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,850
Oh, it's an escalator.

760
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:49,970
Yeah.

761
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,190
At the bibliotech.

762
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:53,990
Oh, bibliotech.

763
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:54,510
Yeah.

764
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,950
Buenos dias.

765
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,150
Buenos dias.

766
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,030
Andle, Andle.

767
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,030
Vamonos.

768
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,590
Those chicas.

769
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,010
All right.

770
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,310
Oh, I can't say that word.

771
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,030
I was going to say a word that I can't say.

772
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,470
No, it's okay.

773
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,650
I held myself back to it.

774
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,650
There were several words I wanted to say.

775
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,330
All right.

776
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,690
Oh, we're so strong.

777
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,310
Dude.

778
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,270
Look at us.

779
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:20,770
Go.

780
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,430
This is unlike real Wi-Fi.

781
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,830
Oh, there's the crow.

782
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:25,250
Hello, sir.

783
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,050
Oh, shoot him!

784
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:27,970
Shoot him!

785
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,090
Shoot the crow!

786
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,550
It's time for exam, Mr. Chicken.

787
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,750
Yay!

788
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,430
See, I got the healer.

789
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:37,990
Let's eat him.

790
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:42,030
I don't think there's any much meat on him left.

791
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,670
Also, isn't he like...

792
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,950
I feel like he's too malnourished.

793
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,610
I don't think it's good meat for our bodies.

794
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,610
I think he's dead, yeah.

795
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,490
It's probably rotting.

796
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,810
Well, I mean, like...

797
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:55,850
I mean, all meat is technically dead meat, but I just feel like... I mean, he has great skin.

798
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:11,710
So I feel like it'll be not good nutritious for us The fresher they are, the better it'll taste Maybe they'll have like a Wendy's around here Yeah, maybe, yeah, Wendy's for human bodies That sounds like a good time Or maybe we can Oh, watch out, there's all the

799
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:19,800
Alright, I've got the key Did you die?

800
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,080
Did you die?

801
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,260
Why did you die?

802
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:30,720
Every time you've fallen, you've never said anything about fall damage.

803
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,040
Wait, you didn't know I was sorry?

804
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,780
I didn't know.

805
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:39,960
No, I knew on some, yeah, I knew on some areas it was, yeah, because you fucking fell into that bitch.

806
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,780
Oh, no, I died every time.

807
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,060
Every single time I died.

808
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,300
I didn't realize that.

809
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,220
I didn't realize that we would have fall damage.

810
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,480
Open sesame.

811
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,140
What's the magic word?

812
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,040
Really, please?

813
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,340
No.

814
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,180
Try again.

815
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,920
What's the magic word?

816
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,540
Fish filet.

817
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,660
Nope, try again.

818
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,500
What's the magic?

819
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,080
You only have three tries left.

820
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,640
What's the magic word?

821
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,060
Oh, frick.

00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,580
Oh, frick.

Oh look, can we die here?

I don't think so.

844
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,180
No, I think he's just... I think that's a warning.

845
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,280
I think he's just walking away.

846
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:51,880

More snacks!

858
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,560
Wait, those are potatoes?

859
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,060
Are they like always, are they like turned into stone or something?

860
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,120
Like, if they see us, we get turned into stone?

861
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,060
Yeah, it looks like they have psoriasis like me.

862

No head.

866
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,100
No head.

867
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,800

00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,280
Oh, can you go up?

871
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,260
Oh, never mind.

872
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,420
We're a bit too heavy.

873
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,740
We're a bit...

874
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:31,900

Oh, what's in there?

878
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,820
I think there's some surprise in here.

879
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,500
Can I break it?

880
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,060
Okay, we can't break this yet.

881
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,040
What about this?

882
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,140
If I hit enough things, it'll work.

883
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,380
Okay, maybe it's not this.

884
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,400
Why is it kind of ominous?

885
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:40,820

00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,100
Wait, what?

894
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,240
Oh, if you, like, leave just a little bit.

895
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,820
Then it, like, then you go down straight down instantly.

896
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,060
Wait, there's something, like, to our left.

897
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,760
You see that?

898
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,940
You check out the thing at the left?

899
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,500
Dude, my paddock-a-dock is weighing me down.

900
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,260
Oh, it was nothing.

901
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,880
My paddock-a-dock.

902
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,480
I think it's all the way up.

903
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,580
Yeah, you get that for me.

904
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,540
How do I go further?

905
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,780
How do I go further?

906
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,600
You just follow the wind.

907
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,420
My hands are in the air.

908
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,820
Stay in the center.

909
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,480
Look, look, look, look.

910
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,200

00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,080
Follow just follow the air.

916
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,920
Wait, I see I got it.

917
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,300

918
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:01,920
I found the center.

919
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:02,620

920
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,180

00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,500
Get back Maybe you should have learned how to use an umbrella.

925
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,520
Oh my god.

926
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,380
I'm not strong enough.

927
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,220
Oh my god.

928
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,880
Where's my AI when I need it?

929
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,060
Where's my- No, no, no!

930
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,480
I'm a game journalist.

931
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,520
I'm a game journalist.

932
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,140
I'm doing how you do me.

933
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,060
I got you!

934
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,160

935
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:29,760
No!

936
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,280
Stay!

937
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,160
I got you.

938
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,720
It's my bad internet.

939
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,160
I only got 2,000 upload downloads, so it's a lot.

940
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:44,880
There, see, I did it.

941
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,740
I restarted my router.

942
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,240
We're good.

943
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,000
All right.

944
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,780
How do I ride this thing?

945
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,180
How do I ride it?

946
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:51,540
Oh!

947
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,520
Oh, I click on it!

948
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,380
Did you do it?

949
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,180
Did you understand it?

950
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh.

951
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,500
Oh.

952
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:57,540
Oh.

953
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,120
Oh.

954
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,640
We're cutting that out.

955
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,620
Here you go.

956
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,180
That's right, you little careful princess.

957
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,000
I see that.

958
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,640
There you go.

959
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,100
My little princess needs some man-wee muscles, I see.

960
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:11,940
Careful princess.

961
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,360
Oh.

962
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,060
What is it?

963
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,580
Oh, it's people stopping.

964
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,440
It's the people, I think.

965
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,080
Is it?

966
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,020
That does not sound like people.

967
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,200
I think it sounds like a...

968
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,160
Like a dog or something.

969
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,100
Like a dog?

970
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,460
Dog.

971
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,400
God.

972
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,080
Is there anything else here?

973
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,780
Wait.

974
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,960
Wait, you see the, there's a rope thing over there?

975
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:40,720
A rope?

976
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,220
What?

977
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,280
How do we do this?

978
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,340
Maybe we gotta stand on.

979
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,480
I don't think we can stand anywhere.

980
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,940
Maybe we both stand on this?

981
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,580
Oh, oh, we have to jump, we have to jump down.

982
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,200
Oh, jump, jump!

983
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Use the power of gravity.

984
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,360
That's okay.

985
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,080
Oh, X.

986
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,440
Oh my God.

987
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,620
We finally learned how to run.

988
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:09,380
Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

989
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,880
Well, one of us finally learned how to run, but...

990
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,100
Okay, let's lock it.

991
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,700
We mean...

992
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,180
I'm not going to name names on who threw there, but...

993
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,360
Yeah, I'm not going to name names, but let's come on.

994
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:34,360

Yeah, boom.

997
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,140
There we go.

998
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,680
We figured oh Boing boing boing.

999
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,320

I use a controller.

1007
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,160
What do you mean?

1008
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,160

00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,200
We're okay.

1049
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,040
Excuse me.

1050
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,980
What does this do, though?

1051
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:08,960
Oh.

1052
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,160
Is this a good thing?

1053
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,120
Oh, I don't think that's a...

1054
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,720
Oh, it's okay.

1055
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,140
He's making a path for us.

1056
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,760
He's both playing with Legos.

1057
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,100
Oh, we go straight down.

1058
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,200
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,080
See, he must be a nice guy.

1060
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:24,780
You know?

1061
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,420
He's so nice.

1062
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,180
He's so nice.

1063
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,260
Nice to us.

1064
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,240
Come on, this way.

1065
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,320
Yeah, just because he's big doesn't mean he's bad.

1066
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,580
Yeah, it's just a little, you know, giant, but...

1067
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,080
Well, so it's hard being six foot, too.

1068
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,020
This is a long-ass elevator.

1069
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,380
Oh, never mind.

1070
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,420
That was not.

1071
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,000
Hello.

1072
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,020
What the frick?

1073
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:45,940
That's so creepy.

1074
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,300
Look.

1075
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,260
What is it?

1076
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:47,600
They were...

1077
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,140
Ew, they're squishy in this head.

1078
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,060
The balls.

1079
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,580
Why are the balls on him?

1080
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,720
Step on him over here.

1081
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,180
They're squishy.

1082
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:55,560
Ew.

00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,920
Oh my gosh, look at all the eggs.

1086
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,360
Squish them.

1087
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,680
I'm saving the world.

1088
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,640
I'm squishing the bugs.

1089
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,280
We're going to destroy the ecosystem.

1090
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,420
I really hope they don't remember that.

1091
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,420
This is the only way I really don't like bugs.

1092
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,360
This is actually creepy.

1093
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,860
Wait, are there going to be other bugs?

1094
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,480
Oh, they're all using the carcasses as like slowness.

1095
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,720
That is actually terrifying for me.

1096
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,440
Do you like bugs?

1097
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,180
No, I'm actually, I'm so, I'm really afraid of ants.

1098
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,440
I just uh Do you know crane flies?

1099
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,800
I'm terrified of crane flies.

1100
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,080
What's what's their dog?

1101
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,120
Like that Oh, they're beetles.

1102
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:05,760
Oh, they're beetles.

1103
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,740
Oh, that's not bad.

1104
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,500
It's not as bad.

1105
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,100
I like beetles.

1106
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:08,380

1107
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,220
I think princess don't bite.

1108
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,120
I I think this might be a might be a bad beetle.

1109
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:25,540
Just maybe just just just a maybe one of us had like a ranged weapon to shoot at there One of us didn't step on all the eggs.

1110
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:26,180
Hmm?

1111
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,580
If only...

1112
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:34,200
If only someone didn't step on all the eggs that the beetles were so hard today.

1113
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,020
Careful, princess.

1114

I'm spamming.

1121
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,360

00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,040

1127
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,100
We, wait, we have to play like a team?

1128
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:11,660
I mean, we can't just enjoy this game solo?

1129
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,260
Come on, all right, all right.

1130
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,200
Listen, here we go.

1131
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,620
Okay, I got it.

1132
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,180
I got it.

1133
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,680
I got it.

1134
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,440
Let's decide.

1135
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,340
I got it.

1136
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,840
I'm paying attention.

1137
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:22,880
For real.

1138
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,840
I'm shooting the floor.

1139
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,360
Okay, you, you, you, you, you.

1140
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,480
Yes!

1141
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,400
You have to jump!

1142
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,180
Team kill!

1143
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,380
Alright, where's the next one?

1144
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,680
Look at all that chickens!

1145
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,020
Ah!

1146
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,000
The demon!

1147
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,300
Look,

1148
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,340
I can't really do anything if I don't see any bugs on the floor.

1149
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,060
Oh, that's all I'm seeing, TV.

1150
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,660
Listen, listen, listen.

1151
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,280
I thought that.

1152
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,060
Listen, listen.

1153
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,160
I shot the floor instead of a bug.

1154
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,000
Alright, wait, isn't it auto aim?

1155
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,180
No, I have to get close on the floor.

1156
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:03,460
I think oh, okay, I'm pretty sure this one is the land here All right, I'm ready Okay, okay Boom!

We both said the directions that were not right No, I said left What do you mean?

1159
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:29,810
It was in the middle about the left Oh my god It's in the middle, not the left.

1160
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:31,430
You were literally right there.

1161
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,430
What do you mean?

1162
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,490
It's auto-aims if you're under it.

1163
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:35,510
I wasn't close to the...

1164
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:35,990
Oh, wait.

1165
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,090
Oh, you have to be under it?

1166
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:42,110
Yeah, you have to be, like, right next to it or else my character goes, I'm going to hit the floor.

00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,470

00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:45,830

First try.

1171
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:48,810

1175
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:53,990

1177
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:54,810
Nice.

Get him.

1179
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:56,710

1181
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,470
Oh, well, my...

1182
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,630
The guy who...

1183
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,470
Oh, the guy that your stepdad.

1184
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:35,510
Yeah, my stepdad.

1185
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,730
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1186
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:40,050
He thought all the things on the tables at the convention were free.

1187
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:42,470
For some reason, because he'd never been to a con before.

1188
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:43,610
And we were at...

1189
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:44,550
I think it was like...

1190
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,650
It was like an energy drink company.

1191
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,970
It was Gamer Sleptor Advanced GG.

1192
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:48,610
I can't remember.

1193
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,350
And my dad stole a candy bar.

1194
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,690
Oh, my... Oh, like, it's just a candy bar.

1195
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:54,570
Okay, that's not that bad.

1196
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:55,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1197
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,390
He thought it was free.

1198
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:56,630
Don't worry.

1199
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:57,330
I messaged them.

1200
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:58,510
They said it was okay.

1201
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:02,010
And I take it home and I feed it to my mom and my grandma.

1202
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:03,290
We're like, oh, it's actually pretty good.

1203
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,850
And it was made with a cricket flower.

1204
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:06,930
We had no idea.

1205
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:08,850
I'm just in fair.

1206
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:13,130
You know, like, red, the color red is like made on a...

1207
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:17,630
Yeah, made... Like, you know, the color red is, like, made of crushed beetle juices.

1208
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,750
Yeah, a lot of makeup is made out of the movie.

1209
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,490
A lot of makeup is made out of bugs.

1210
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,890
That's true, too, yeah.

1211
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:23,810
Yeah.

1212
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:24,430
Oh.

1213
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,790
You got it.

1214
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,290
I think it's like one of...

1215
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:34,630
Yeah, I think like only one of us can go in one at a time.

1216
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,350
One at a time.

1217
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,570
One at a con.

1218
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,430
Oh, get the eggs.

1219
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:41,910
Oh, yeah, make sure.

1220
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,090

1227
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,950

1237
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,950
Yes, like, in the movies and stuff.

You run.

1270
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,740
You hold X and this starts slide dashing.

1271
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,100
Did you know I used my keyboard wrong?

1272
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:10,540
Wait, what?

1273
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,020
So I can't.

1274
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,540
I use my ring finger to press W.

1275
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,300
Ring finger?

1276
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,500
What does that even look like?

1277
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,220
Because, you know, like, typing, you keep, like, your index finger on F.

1278
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:21,940
Yeah.

1279
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:24,760

The coma theory is real!

1283
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,060
Hey, where are you?

01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,140

Do you see me or you?

1286
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,120
I didn't see you.

1287
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,440
Because you had the long hair.

1288
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:45,440
Yeah.

1289
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,220

1290
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,400
Oh.

1291
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,160
I don't want to...

1292
01:06:54,160 --> 01:07:26,380
The baby said I don't want to play with you anymore the freaking toy story meme oh wait what oh so like oh I think it's like escapism because like you have a trauma or something and then you like went under your bed and went back into your dream world it's like yeah the like the it's like the other part of your mind where the trauma manifests yeah yeah oh hey hey am I part of the are you real yeah am I real Am I part of the trauma?

1293
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,980
Is this collab real?

1294
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,820
Dad was never real.

1295
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:33,480
TV.

1296
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,800
Be honest, someone said the doll looks like me.

1297
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,340
Is it true?

1298
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:40,830
Are you lagging?

1299
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,310
I think she disconnected, guys.

1300
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,190
I think she got replaced with an AI.

1301
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:48,350
Lookie.

1302
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,720
Oh, that chicken.

1303
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:53,540
Oh, chicken.

1304
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,420
Oh, hey.

1305
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,260
Oh, shit.

1306
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,560
Oh, shit, don't jump down.

1307
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:07,440
We have both LWs.

1308
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,340
Real deep.

1309
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,940
Don't worry, it was all a dream.

1310
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,440
It was a coma theory.

1311
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:14,920
Oh, yeah.

1312
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:15,760
It's fine.

1313
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,820
It's like Pokemon, right?

1314
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:17,740
Yeah, exactly.

1315
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:18,960
Yeah.

1316
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,160
Yeah.

1317
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:20,720
All right.

1318
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,260
Don't go this way.

1319
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,460
Look at all the drawings.

1320
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,340
No!

1321
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,540
Oh, wait, you're alive.

1322
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:30,920
Okay.

1323
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,260
No, I died.

1324
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,980
Oh, oh, it restarts you.

1325
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,220
No, there was a very loud crunch.

1326
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,400
Maybe it fixed my spine.

1327
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:44,760
Oh, yeah, maybe.

1328
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:45,900
We straightened it.

1329
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:46,900
We did it, guys.

1330
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,260
We cured scoliosis.

1331
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:51,940
Dude, it's awesome.

1332
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,060
My back is not...

1333
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:53,300
Oh!

1334
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,100
Okay, um...

1335
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,680
No one say anything.

1336
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,000
Something...

1337
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:01,820
What?

1338
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,500
Something... Oh, you thought I could reset my game.

1339
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:05,720
Did you die?

1340
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,000
No, I got, like, teleported somehow.

1341
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,020
What did you do?

1342
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,760
I was down here walking around, and then my screen was black.

1343
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,020
Oh, that's so weird.

1344
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,200
I'm not scared of this motherfucker.

1345
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,100
What's you gonna do, huh?

1346
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:19,760
Ah!

1347
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:20,900
No!

1348
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,820
Tokey help.

1349
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,200
Tokey help.

1350
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,320
I thought it was AFK.

1351
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,160
So, um, yeah, that's what it...

1352
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:34,660

01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:16,950
What do we do then?

1357
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,170
Okay, I'm gonna follow you.

1358
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,730
Why is she so mean?

1359
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,310
Did no one love her as a child?

1360
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,590
Maybe Coco Melon got canceled.

1361
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:28,230
Oh, we got to wait.

1362
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:29,430
I think we just had to wait.

1363
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:30,850
Right?

1364
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,650
Hey, Coco, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1365
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:36,150
Okay, wait.

1366
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:39,410
We gotta put on dancing fruit videos.

1367
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:40,450
Go.

1368
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,890
I thought I could go behind the triangle.

1369
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:44,530
I was wrong.

1370
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:45,650
Wait, I think I can.

1371
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:46,470
Oh, break.

1372
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:48,650
I think we just hesitated.

1373
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:49,030
Oh, wait.

1374
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:50,270
I don't want to pattern now.

1375
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:52,110
We hesitated a little bit too much.

1376
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:52,610
She sees the equation.

1377
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,390
I see it.

1378
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:54,330
I see the numbers.

1379
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,590
The numbers are clicking.

1380
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:56,770
Oh, my God.

1381
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,430
The numbers.

1382
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:04,230
341, 4159, 265358979323846647950.

1383
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:07,010
I see the numbers.

1384
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:08,730
I see the numbers.

1385
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:14,790
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1386
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:16,430
Just wait a little.

1387
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:17,370
How do we hit the bridge?

1388
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,530
I know, standing.

1389
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:20,130
Oh, there you go.

1390
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:21,810
And then we just move.

1391
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:22,730
Stay here.

1392
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:23,990
You safely, safely.

1393
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:26,490
And then we go, we go, we go, we go, we go, we go.

1394
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:27,190
Oh my god.

1395
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,270
We go, we go, we go.

1396
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:31,970
Why was it like in the server?

1397
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:33,790
And then...

1398
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:34,290
Move, move, move.

1399
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:36,130
Move.

1400
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:36,570
Move.

1401
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:37,130
Move.

1402
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,510
You're so thick right now.

1403
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:41,230
Oh, hey, baby.

1404
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,770
Open it, don't!

1405
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:47,450
I've never heard a girl say that the mirror's so thick right now.

1406
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:48,990
Yeah, oh, dude.

1407
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:51,030
Okay.

1408
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:53,270
I think...

1409
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,150
Oh, we have to push this.

1410
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:54,870
Yeah, I went to pull.

1411
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:57,490
I'm doing it.

1412
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:58,230
I'm pulling.

1413
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,090
She's pulling?

1414
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,170
Do you know I just recited, like, 40 digits of pie?

1415
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:07,070
I know 3.14.

1416
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:07,790
Yeah.

1417
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:08,110
Half set.

1418
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:08,910
Yeah.

1419
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:10,430
You know, like, pie day?

1420
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:13,330
Oh, like, the food or the number?

1421
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:15,290
Uh, well, both.

1422
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:17,830
So, like, uh, March, what was it?

1423
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:18,730
March?

1424
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:19,970
I baked the pie last month.

1425
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:20,950
Oh, nice.

1426
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,790
What kind of pie was it?

1427
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,710
Pizza pie.

1428
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:24,510
Oh.

1429
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:28,530
So, on pie day, my school did a thing where you can recite 100 digits of pie.

1430
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,190
You can pie any teacher you want.

1431
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:33,090
Did you do it?

1432
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:33,970
Yeah, I did that.

1433
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,410
Did it in, like, two days.

1434
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:38,650
I memorized it in two days because I hated this teacher in my school.

1435
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,350
That's awesome, dude.

1436
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:42,370
I was like...

1437
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:43,170
That's based.

1438
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,830
I inspired me that petty.

1439
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:45,590
That's awesome.

1440
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:45,870
Yeah.

1441
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:47,930
So there was a teacher I really fucking hated.

1442
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:50,590
I was like, this is it.

1443
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:54,170
This is the one opportunity I can get.

1444
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:56,310
Stupid baby doesn't know how to look up.

1445
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:58,590
Yeah, gamers don't look up.

1446
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:02,070
Ugh.

1447
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:03,890
Oh!

1448
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,950
I...

1449
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:07,630
What happened?

1450
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:11,070
What happened?

1451
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,890
Are you okay?

1452
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:18,950
Oh.

1453
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:20,730
What's up?

1454
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:21,730
How you doing?

1455
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:23,730
I think I know what happened.

1456
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:25,070
How's your day?

1457
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,930
We have a good day today, Doki.

1458
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:28,570
Wait, where did you go?

1459
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:31,190
Surprise!

1460
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,470
Oh, wait on me.

1461
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,530
I thought you were there.

1462
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:38,530
I was gonna surprise you.

1463
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:40,410
It is I.

1464
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:42,970
Oh my god, wait.

1465
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:45,250
Someone was having a good time.

1466
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:47,010
I don't think they were.

1467
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,490
I think that's actually the opposite.

1468
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,990
Someone was having a good time.

1469
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,610
Look at that.

1470
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:52,410
You know what this is.

1471
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:54,550
He wants walkies.

1472
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:55,610
He wants walkies.

1473
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:00,670
Someone was having too good.

1474
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:00,970
Oh.

1475
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:03,350
It's time to learn how to tie a rope.

1476
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,010
Well, I've been here before.

1477
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:05,510
Oh, wait, wait.

1478
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:06,430
What?

1479
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:07,470
What?

1480
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:11,350
We can talk about it.

1481
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:11,970
Let's move on.

1482
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:12,270
Oh, okay.

1483
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:14,630
Oh, I got to shoot that rope over there

1484
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:20,630
Shoot that rope over there.

1485
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:25,230
I have to shoot my rope.

1486
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,570
Oh my god.

1487
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:28,750
Oh my god.

1488
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:31,030
Oh, it's Bell Tick tock.

1489
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:31,750
Tick tock.

1490
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:35,970
Bong, bong, bong, bong, bong.

1491
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,530
Oh, oh, oh, here get in the box.

1492
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:39,070
Get in the box.

1493
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,390
Oh Hit the box!

1494
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:41,730
Hit the box!

1495
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:42,270
Get the box!

1496
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:43,250
There's the box!

1497
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:48,690
It's like, what box are you talking about?

1498
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:51,370
No, it was like the sacks.

1499
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,250
You can't see it.

1500
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:54,730
Okay, here we go.

1501
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:55,290
That's it.

1502
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:56,670
It's like it never happened.

1503
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:57,730
It was all dream, remember?

1504
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:58,970
It's a coma thing.

1505
01:14:59,370 --> 01:14:59,410
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1506
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,170
NLR, NLR.

1507
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:00,970
Yeah, yeah.

1508
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:02,790
You might as well cut that out too.

1509
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:04,330
Sorry.

1510
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:05,350
Editors, cut this out.

1511
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:05,910
Cut that out.

1512
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:06,710
Editors, cut that out.

1513
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:07,670
Editors, keep this in.

1514
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,130
Alright, bong!

1515
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,850
So when my chat just said, my fedora stinks.

1516
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:19,930
Yeah, I know you were fedora.

1517
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:25,690
My fedora stinks!

1518
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:30,330
Oh, there she goes.

1519
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:31,710
Why is she so angry?

1520
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:34,330
Your mama didn't hug her enough?

1521
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:35,310
Same.

1522
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:36,690
My dad didn't.

1523
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,870
Oh man, that sucks, man.

1524
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:39,190
I know.

1525
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:40,090
Get back, get back!

1526
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:40,730
Oh.

1527
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:42,090
Oh, Taco Bell!

1528
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:46,870
It's like new toy!

1529
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:48,010
No!

1530
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:48,970
He's stimming.

1531
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:50,890
She's stimming.

1532
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:52,550
It's stimming.

1533
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:53,290
I don't...

1534
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:53,830
I'm scared.

1535
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:55,170
They're stimming.

1536
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:56,450
Boom!

1537
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:58,150
Wait, what do we do here?

1538
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,250
Oh, maybe down here?

1539
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:00,850
Oh, here.

1540
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:01,790
No?

1541
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:05,070
Can we jump over here?

1542
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1543
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:07,210
Oh, okay.

1544
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:09,490

That's okay.

I'll get it done in enough time.

1551
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,020
Did you get it done?

Watch this, boys.

1558
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:58,540
All right.

1559
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,000
What is there up to...

1560
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,220
I'm so bad at the freaking...

1561
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,660
The stupid umbrella.

1562
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,580
It's so stupid.

1563
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,100
I'm so bad at it.

1564
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,000
It's stupid.

1565
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,220
It's so stupid.

1566
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,940
I'm actually trying.

1567
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,220
Okay, we're good.

1568
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:21,600
We're good.

1569
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:28,780
The more you say it, the less I'm starting to believe that you're trying.

1570
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,540
Here, I opened the lever.

1571
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,660
I think you can come up now.

1572
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:33,940
All right.

1573
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,400
Oh, there's a ladder on your left.

1574
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,440
It's a ladder?

1575
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:37,500
Yes.

1576
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,140
Oh, I see.

1577
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:38,760
I see it.

1578
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:39,840
Here, it's right here.

1579
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,460
Oh, hey.

1580
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:45,860
got better.

1581
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,840
I'm sure I'm sure they were the ladders.

1582
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,200
Did you find it?

1583
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,440
Alright, cool, I got you.

1584
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,840
Alright, I'm heading up.

1585
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,620
Wait, are you up top right now?

1586
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:54,700
No, I died.

1587
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:55,520
Fire!

1588
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:56,580
It's fire!

1589
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:01,120
I wanted to make sure you saw it.

1590
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:01,840
It's just hard to notice.

1591
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:02,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1592
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:02,980
You want to make sure...

1593
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,820
You know, like, sometimes maybe there won't be fall damage next time, you know?

1594
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1595
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,920
You gotta test it all out.

1596
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:13,340
Gotta know which one has fall damage and which one doesn't.

1597
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,720
Maybe one day you're just, suddenly you're just going to start floating, you know?

1598
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,560
You don't know that.

1599
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,860
How do you know gravity works every time?

1600
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:22,780
I'm going to ascend to the heavens.

1601
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:23,600
Exactly.

1602
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,080
Oh.

1603
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:25,800
They got, look at this.

1604
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:26,720
They got salt.

1605
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,340
Or like, is that ashes?

1606
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,700
I think that's just rock.

1607
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:30,880
Oh.

1608
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:31,640
Oh my God.

1609
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:32,020
Oh my God.

1610
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:32,400
Get your breath.

1611
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,000
Get your breath.

1612
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,860
It's E, okay, it's E.

1613
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,700
Okay, okay, okay, stop asking myself.

1614
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:53,760
Okay, okay.

1615
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,140
E, E.

1616
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:56,300
Boom.

1617
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,420
Wait, put it away!

1618
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:57,800
Okay.

1619
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,180
Here you go.

1620
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,660
Just go for it.

1621
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,620
Just go for it.

1622
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,780
And then you take it down.

1623
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:05,920
You did it!

1624
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:06,480
Yay!

1625
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,580
You learned.

1626
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:10,160
Thank you.

1627
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:10,740
Thank you.

1628
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:11,300
I did.

1629
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,160
You learned.

1630
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,080
What did you learn today, Chibi?

1631
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,440
E is umbrella.

1632
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,320
Yay!

1633
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,460
All right.

1634
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,860
Doing where I got you.

1635
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,140
Click that link, guys.

1636
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:25,080
I'm going to click the link pin in our chats.

1637
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:28,560
I feel like something bad is going to happen right here.

1638
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,340
I don't...

1639
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,400
I think it's fine.

1640
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:31,060
Oh, we're good.

1641
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,420
Oh, we have to go...

1642
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:35,380
Maybe...

1643
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,260
We have to go here.

1644
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,820
Yeah, let's go through this room.

1645
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,140
At least there's no giant baby.

1646
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,460
For now.

1647
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,120
Oh, right here, right here.

1648
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:46,760
Oh, our...

1649
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:47,500
Tito.

1650
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,380
Oh, alright.

1651
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:49,340
Oh, thanks.

1652
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:49,900
Alright.

1653
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:50,620
I'll be...

1654
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,200
Oh, I gotta help.

1655
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:51,920
Oh, we got white.

1656
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,460
Come on.

1657
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:55,640
We got white paint.

1658
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:57,520
How do I grab you?

1659
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,360
I think you have to go up yourself.

1660
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,920
Yeah, I think you have to go up yourself.

1661
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:05,660
Okay.

1662
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:06,520
I'll be back.

1663
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,400
And then she never came back.

1664
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:13,240
I

1665
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:17,930
don't have depth perception.

1666
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,830
I felt it's not a joke.

1667
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:20,530
I actually found it.

1668
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,690
There's no depth all right.

1669
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:22,410
It's my turn.

1670
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:27,550
You've lost your privilege Up you go queen All right, you missed the jump.

All right.

1673
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:28,630
Nice.

1674
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,110

Oh, see doodle.

They're bad.

01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,920
The wheel of wow, they don't even get a prize.

1725
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:45,980
The wheel of what?

1726
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,320
Yeah, and the wishing well.

1727
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,440
They don't get any.

1728
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,000
It was gambling for toddlers, the wishing law.

1729

Oh, did you got to teach them young, you know?

I start itching whenever I can't.

Shoot that.

1734
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,760
I got nervous to shoot.

1735
01:23:58,940 --> 01:23:59,280

01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:06,240
We'll get past the stage eventually.

1773
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,460
Can't be that hard, right?

1774
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,280

1781
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:26,940

01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,160
And now there was one.

1795
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:42,060
Oh, my gosh.

1796
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:42,940
It's in the box.

1797
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,380
No.

1798
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,100

1799
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:48,780

I'm going to lie back in my chair and close my eyes.

1808
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,140
Until you get it right.

1809
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:31,980

1810
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:33,860

01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,200
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1814
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,500
I'm closing my eyes.

1815
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,120
Close your eyes until you get it right.

1816
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:41,480
Ha, ha, ha.

1817
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,460
I did it!

1818
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:45,740
Oh, my God.

1819
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:46,740
I did it.

1820
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,160
That's all it took.

1821
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,040
All right, I'm heading over now.

1822
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:52,760
Don't worry.

1823
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:55,680
Daddy's coming He's coming home.

1824
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,800
He's got the- Yay!

1825
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:57,900
I'm coming home!

1826
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:00,080
I wish this happened in real life.

1827
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,860
You coming home, not like getting like- Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1828
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,060
Not like being like, you know, murdered.

1829
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:08,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1830
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:09,380
That would Loki suck.

1831
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:13,860
Yeah, I think like, you know, being murdered might not be like the funnest thing in the world.

1832
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,200
That would not be a Potter's moment.

1833
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,880
Yeah, I feel like- Oh!

1834
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:17,980
Oh!

1835
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:18,460
Oh!

1836
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:18,720
Oh!

1837
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:19,900
You gotta run, you gotta run.

1838
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,160
I got hydraulic pressed.

1839
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:33,240
It's just, you know, it's hard to run when, you know, we're just so, like, weighed down, you know, by our traveler.

1840
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,140
If you got hydraulic pressed, what do you think would pop out?

1841
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:39,160
I think, like, a bunch of bubbles would come out if you got hydraulic pressed.

1842
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,320
Or, like, some, like, balloons.

1843
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:40,580
Me?

1844
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:41,500
Or you?

1845
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,500
They're like feathers, because you're a bird.

1846
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:43,580
Oh, that's true.

1847
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:48,500
I think for you, it'll be, like, you know, have you ever watched Honey Boo Boo?

1848
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:51,940
Yes, yes, I feel like one episode.

1849
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:57,440
I feel like, wait, if you ever get hydraulic press, you just like...

1850
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,640
I guess we'll never know.

1851
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,600
I guess we'll just never know.

1852
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:06,000
I need to get my older brother to plug in the controller.

1853
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,700
I guess we'll just never know.

1854
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,840
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

1855
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:13,600
We need to, we need to...

1856
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:13,960
Guys.

1857
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:19,370
I got bad bees.

1858
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:20,430
I'm getting a little...

1859
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:21,390
Yeah, she just left.

1860
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:24,870

See, and all babies deserve to live.

1892
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:43,830
Well, I mean, especially if they have, like, death laser eyeballs.

1893
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:44,970
That's kind of like...

1894
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:53,030
Like, I mean, like, if your baby is going to turn out to be, like, a serial killer, like, like, would you really let your baby grow old?

1895
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:56,370
You know, I mean, like, I don't know.

1896
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:58,310
Us, we're losing a 1v1 to a toddler.

1897
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:59,690
Well, it's a 1v2.

So that's, like, three of us.

1900
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,710
Not the drug, the item.

1901
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:05,930
What?

1902
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:06,610
Oh.

1903
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:07,430

01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:08,470
How do I throw it?

1905
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:09,290
How do I throw it?

1906
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:11,190
I don't think I can throw it.

1907
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:11,970
Sweet!

1908
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:13,110
Whoa!

1909
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:14,830

01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:20,090
Oh, we gotta go down this way.

1911
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:20,590

We don't need to play with a friend.

2134
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:23,150
Did you just jump off again?

2135
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,910
I'm a victim.

2136
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:26,690
Oh, what?

2137
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:29,150
I'm a victim.

2138
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:31,230
What are you a victim of?

2139
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:32,770
I got pushed off.

2140
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:35,110
By who?

2141
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:35,870
By who?

2142
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:37,350
What pushed you off, Tivi?

2143
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:40,770
You did.

2144
01:43:42,270 --> 01:43:42,710
Wait, wait, wait.

2145
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:43,690
We want to see something cool up here.

2146
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:43,950
Yeah, sure.

2147
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,310
Yeah, sure.

2148
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:45,310
I want to see something cool up.

2149
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:49,070
Wait, I don't have my umbrella anymore.

2150
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:49,450
Do you?

2151
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:50,650
Oh, I don't.

2152
01:43:50,730 --> 01:43:51,330
Wait, I think...

2153
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:52,830
Wait, why would your umbrella?

2154
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:55,430
I wanted to use it and jump off and see where I'd go.

2155
01:43:55,610 --> 01:43:56,070
I don't think...

2156
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:59,310
Oh, maybe, like, we can use the umbrella, like...

2157
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:01,490
Yeah, maybe it's like an area specific.

2158
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:02,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2159
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:05,150
That's fair enough, because I bet you could, like, get to places you're not supposed to.

2160
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:05,690
Yeah, yeah.

2161
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:07,990
So you don't want to, like, you know, bug that out or anything.

2162
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:09,810
Yeah.

2163
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:10,110
But yeah.

2172
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:19,830

I'm like a little, I'm a little addicted to it.

2176
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:27,110
I just started playing.

2177
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:28,070
I've only played it once.

2178
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:29,330
Do you have any advice for me?

2179
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:30,390
Um.

2180
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,030

Everyone write that down.

2186
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:43,290
If you don't die, you'll get the high score.

2187
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:45,330
I got top 1 million.

2188
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:46,870
You got top 1 million?

2189
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:47,710

01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:49,950
Top 99 percentile.

2191
01:44:50,210 --> 01:44:50,810
That's good, right?

2192
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:52,450

Yeah, no, I had, I had, like, a 14, like, maybe, like, almost 20-plus hours stream in the span of, like, a day and a half.

2223
01:45:53,470 --> 01:45:54,510
What were you addicted to?

2224
01:45:54,570 --> 01:45:55,630
What were you using Marvel Rivals?

2225
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:59,010

2226
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:01,610

Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2258
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:16,550
And if you said for me, especially today, because I think a lot of people stayed up for a very long time, head to bed, because you deserve it.

2259
01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:18,690
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2260
01:48:19,310 --> 01:48:20,150
Bye, guys.

2261
01:48:20,630 --> 01:48:21,050
Bye.
