1
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,930
Hello everybody!

2
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,210
Hello, hello!

3
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,830
Oh my gosh, so I was going crazy listening to this song.

4
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,470
I feel like the BGM for this song is like 10 seconds long.

5
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,330
It has been repeating non-stop for the last 10 minutes.

6
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,530
I felt like I was going fucking crazy waiting for the stream to start.

7
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,110
But anyway, hello everyone!

8
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,430
I have some good news.

9
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,990
I fixed the problem with waking up at 6 30 a.m.

10
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,170
And you know what I did?

11
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:12,890
That couldn't wake me up at 6 30 in the morning anymore because I stayed up till 6 30.

12
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,130
I fixed it.

13
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,750
Modern problems needed modern solutions.

14
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,150
That's all I had to do.

15
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:57,610
If I stay up at 6 30 in the morning, woken up at 6 30 in the morning i did it what a brilliant plan i had um um but yes though i was playing rivals last night because like okay i have a little i have a sleep schedule problem right now because um right after stream yesterday i went and took a nap and i took a five to six hours quote unquote nap and i woke up at around 11 p.m and then i was like you know what i want to play Now that I'm awake,

16
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,870
I sort of want to play Rivals.

17
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,230
So I spent, like, I think I played Rink for, like, four to five hours.

18
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,210
And then I was like, you know what, now, you know what, I'm awake anyway.

19
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,810
I might as well just stay up a little longer.

20
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,850
Because, like, at that point, I ended the stream around, like, 5 a.m.

21
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,490
And so I was like, I'm not going to wait.

22
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,770
I'm not going to feed him an hour early because then he'll be, like, feeding time's going to be at 5 in the morning.

23
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,530
And so, so I was like, I might as well just stay up till 6.30, feed him, and then go to bed.

24
00:07:26,610 --> 00:08:27,150
and and because I did that he didn't wake me up guys well he woke me up once but also guys it's crazy I also had it I also had another brilliant plan you know when I used to let him up on my bed for sleep time because it was like six 30 in the morning I closed my door I was like I literally was like pools closed so I closed my door so all I heard was the muffled sounds of him barking door but that's fine that's fine because it's a lot quieter it was such a revolutionary i i know it was so brilliant i don't know why i never thought about this before i just closed my door and that's all i had to do closing the door solved everything if i yeah exactly if i can't see the problem then it doesn't exist um champion metal thank you the super chat thank you thank you Stokey Bird.

25
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,170
Today is my birthday.

26
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,950
Can I get a happy birthday from your majesty?

27
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,330
Of course, of course.

28
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,910
My humble dragons, my humble peasants in my kingdom.

29
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,330
Of course, I'll give you a happy birthday.

30
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,610
A happy birthday to you.

31
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,570
Happy birthday to you.

32
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,550
Happy birthday, dear my subject, Champion Mel.

33
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,410
Happy birthday to you.

34
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:47,930
Yay!

35
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,390
Happy birthday!

36
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,110
Uh, Oro, thank you, Super Chat.

37
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,770
Thank you, thank you.

38
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,410
Judges are morally exempt from being woken up to feed dogs or something.

39
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,930
Thank you for the super chat.

40
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:58,370
Thank you.

41
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,030
Thank you.

42
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:12,250
Also, right after the stream, my manager woke up and got on his phone and texted me and was like, you do know that is a scam, right?

43
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,230
And then, I can't believe he would say that such a thing.

44
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,970
I am now legally a citizenship, a citizen of CELAD.

45
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,030
Not only am I a citizen, I am the Duchess of CELAD.

46
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,830
nation is a fucking scam.

47
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,890
I am so insulted.

48
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,870
I am royalty now.

49
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,210
Anyway, I was like, and then I ignored it.

50
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,410
I ghosted that question.

51
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,930
And then he was like, uh, you can, are you going to get a refund?

52
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,910
And then, you know, you know, being a me, I, of course, also didn't reply back.

53
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,030
I was like, oh yeah, you know how we have to have the sponsor?

54
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:43,170
Like, what are we supposed to do for that next week so anyway and I am I am very excited to play water park simulator I heard I heard a lot of good things about I heard a lot of good things about it people were having some people were getting really addicted to it it's basically like the TCG shop simulator where I mean it was pretty addicting i can tell why people really like playing it uh the tcg uh look i don't respond back to non-royals okay like look there's just there's just no connection you know like like talk to me when you have nobility in your blood uh

55
00:10:47,290 --> 00:11:53,310
but anyway i heard that it was made really popular by keso and that's why everybody yeah peasant dare to speak to me i bet you have zero royal blood in you um um i i am a noble descent the highest by the way duchessness duchesses are the highest form of nobility below king queen so um i am of noble language okay um anyway uh queso actually what got got water park simulator number one in the twitch category by himself like he was like i think he was like rank one like water park simulator was rank one and it was single-handedly carried by queso because he had like 50 000 people watching him play water park simulator so i was like holy yeah um but that's really uh i saw i saw so many people playing it so I was like,

56
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,290
yeah, I'll give it a shot.

57
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,870
I mean, I enjoyed the TCG simulator, so I figured why not.

58
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:05,670
And I was looking through the settings, and I noticed something very interesting.

59
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,310
There is Twitch integration.

60
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,170
And I figured, why not?

61
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,870
Let's add some Twitch integration into this.

62
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,050
I don't know how to, I'm going to try to see if it can connect there.

63
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,390
So it's explanation point visit and explanation point.

64
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:57,930
hire me and as a new citizen of sea land I shall expand the micro nation and make new sea land in the middle of Canada just like Quebec I shall make new sea land and since this is own sovereign territory I the Duchess of sea land will take the responsibility of declaring a new minimum wage And if you get the honor of being hired here by me,

65
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:14,170
you can earn a huge whopping amount of $0.00 an hour because that's right, you get to work for royalty and that itself is already payment enough.

66
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,670
That's right.

67
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,330
What a deal.

68
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:29,690
Also, a ticket to New Zealand is $99.99, which is cheaper than Disneyland.

69
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,030
And I would say better than Disneyland.

70
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,990
No, better than Disney World.

71
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,350
All right, let's add Twitch integration real quick.

72
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,790
Give me a sec.

73
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,290
I don't know how, I wonder if that actually works.

74
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,230
All right, connect.

75
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:57,810
they connect it says connect please that is my twitch channel name oh wait i think it's they connect

76
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:53,690

00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,530
I'm sorry pool is closed.

Anyway, new game Don't worry I'll open I'm opening New Zealand to to the journalists and the social like and and the and the Influencers so you guys can get like it's like the Universal Park place the what was that the you know The new Universal Park where they opened it to only influencers to record everything.

79
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,090
That's That's right.

80
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,230
New Zealand.

81
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,670
Create.

82
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,920
Sorry, it's closed beta right now.

83
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,900
This is closed beta New Zealand.

84
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,640
You quit your hated job and used your last savings to chase a dream.

85
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,760
You bought an old abandoned water park.

86
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,520
Can you restore it to its former glory or will it fail just like it did under its previous owner?

87
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,660
Hey Joe, thank you, the super chat.

88
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:44,960
Thank you.

89
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,480
Thank you.

90
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:45,660
Thank you.

91
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,340
I thought Quebec in the middle of the hand that was already called Alberta.

92
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,080
Thank you for the super chat.

93
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,400
Thank you.

94
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,540
Oh shit, Twitch chat on the screen?

95
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,680
I didn't even notice.

96
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,720
I forgot to take it off from before.

97
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,060
Alright, my new sea land.

98
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:10,940
As the Duchess of sea land, I shall expand the propaganda of sea land and establish new sea land in the middle of Canada.

99
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,120
So they shall know our name.

100
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,240
We deserve to be recognized by other countries.

101
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,580
We are the micro-names.

102
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
that deserves recognition.

103
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,480
This dusty broken down Wi-Fi has definitely seen some better days.

104
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,420
But you're here to change all that.

105
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,000
First, let's cure all the old buildings.

106
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,880
Use your sledgehouse.

107
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,680
Okay, what old building am I clearing, though?

108
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,300
This way?

109
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,420
I don't understand.

110
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,040
What?

111
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:41,900
Oh, here?

112
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,360
But this is a cool pool.

113
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,060
Look at this.

114
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,760
I can fix this pool up.

115
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,560
I just gotta get rid of the trash and clean it up.

116
00:16:50,620 --> 00:17:16,560
exactly five-star cleaning this hell trash is everywhere and let's be real no one's lining up to relax next to a pallet of old soda cans grab a trash bag and clean up the best and toss it all by holding it into the trash bag okay i'll destroy this trash oh wait where's the trash bin where is it oh it's over here i think this is already bigger than the original sea land

117
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,260
bigger than the oil rake in the middle of the ocean.

118
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,500
All right, let's grab this.

119
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,840
All right, we're crashed.

120
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,400
Oh, I need more trash bags.

121
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,520
I already had some.

122
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,080
Oh, no, I didn't.

123
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,240
Oh, I accidentally threw, like, empty trash in the trash bag.

124
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,400
That's right.

125
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,240
What would Sea Lime do without me, guys?

126
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,080
Look at me go.

127
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm already...

128
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,580
I'm already...

129
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,560
expanding our land.

130
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,380
Oh.

131
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,320
Here you go.

132
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Chuck chuck.

133
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,060
Oh wait, I can just, I can just, like, Kobe it.

134
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,020
Alright, let's grab all of this trash away.

135
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,830
Here I'll go.

136
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,950
It's so hard being a sovereign in two different countries.

137
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,630
For Doki London, New Zealand.

138
00:18:23,310 --> 00:19:44,580

141
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,020
I'm sorry your application got declined.

142
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,780
I don't know we cannot provide you the information why your application was declined.

143
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:14,880
By the way, every time you some when you submit an immigration assistant an immigration form to become a citizen of New Zealand, it is a $50 fee per application.

144
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,500
So and that's the low end by the way.

145
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:33,060
If you get the immigration premium form, it's actually with a low, low price of $99.99.

146
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:43,480
And by getting the immigration premium form, you'd only have to do 10 questions instead of 100.

147
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,660
It's like our little fast pass.

148
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
I'm the water plug and the closer to fill the...

149

161
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,980
Why do I need that?

162
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,020

We're not a European Union, but we only accept euros as a currency in New Zealand.

165
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,300

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,370
What about six hours?

176
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,390
Come on.

177
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,170
Unbelievable?

178
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,570
Well, you're still here.

179
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,330
Oh, no!

180
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,630
Wait, did she buy it?

181
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,090
She paid for it already, right?

182
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:47,730
$5.

183
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,230
Okay.

184
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:52,990
Did she pay for it?

185
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,970
I couldn't tell.

186
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,370
Oh, it was just a suggestion.

187
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,470
She didn't have to.

188
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,870
She didn't have to take the ticket.

189
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,520
She was a teenager anyway.

190
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,900
She would have peed in the pool.

191
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,600
Eight hours.

192
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,700
What the fuck are you doing in my pool for eight hours?

193
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,100
I should just ban you for life after that.

194
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,660
Like.

195
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,360
You can spot them quite easy to push them out to send a message.

196
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,000
No ticket.

197
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,860
Who came in?

198
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,400
Who came into my park?

199
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:29,940
Who was it?

200
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,140
Okay, I gave you... Was it you?

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,100
You didn't pay the...

205
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,500
You didn't pay the $50.

206
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,480

207

00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,600
Alright, here we go.

212
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,540

Oh, okay.

215
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,120
And so I can just chuck it whenever.

216
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,260
Pre-coup.

217
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,720
Ah!

218
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,040
Where is this water made of?

219
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,080
This is not H2O.

220
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,940
Someone's slimy up my pool.

221
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,200
Moppy, moppy Moppy, moppy Why is the water wet?

222

Who is this freak in New Zealand?

00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,390

00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,310

00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,150

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,710
This is the Sea Land welcome.

381
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,870
The art of the idea.

382
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,230
Sea Land is launching an attack.

383
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,690
New Sea Land will not rest.

384
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,730

388
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,390
Just a little bit.

389
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,770

How do I get this to work?

393
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,110
I don't understand.

394
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:40,810
I did every step.

395
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,470
What else could I be missing?

396
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:51,210
I don't understand.

397
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,450
What else could I be missing from this integration?

It's just, it's like vaccines, you know?

400
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,790
You know how, like, if you want to go to this country, you got to get some vaccinations.

401
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,550
Like, if you want to visit New Zealand, just make sure you have a tetanus shot.

402
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,750
Like, it's just, you know, just basic country things.

403
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,350
Basic culture stuff you got to follow.

404
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,230
You know?

405
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,470
It's got to make sure.

406
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,210
It's just a simple request.

407
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,410
I mean, if you don't get it, you're legally not allowed to sue us.

408
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,690
Because we warned you.

409
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,890
Basic country things.

410
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,390
Like, you don't get your tennis shots before you visit a new country?

411
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,670
Someone's not prepared.

412
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,750
I guess that makes sense.

413
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,350
Right up, Flyers.

414
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,950
Oh, wait, but I already did do that.

415
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,570
How did all these puddles come to be?

416
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,370

417
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,110

00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,110
Also, I hope the sound's been okay.

420
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,860
Alright.

421
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,460
Let's see.

422
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:12,560
Also, the great thing about New Zealand is that you don't need to get a visa to visit here.

423
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,520
You need a visa to...

424
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,480
I mean, you might need a passport to come into Canada.

425
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,320
But after that, it's so easy to get into New Zealand.

426
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,780
Just gotta get a passport to get into Canada.

427
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,960
Because we're sort of like in the middle of But that's okay.

That's right.

456
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,440
I'm also the immigration officer, too.

457
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,780
I think I won't deport your ass.

458
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,660
Okay.

459
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:41,120

00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,900
Like, I gave her a Bonus and she got mad at me

462
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,380
I like, I basically gave her immigration premium and she didn't want it.

463
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,660
Alright, time to print out some more flowers.

464
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,600

468
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,640
Where am I getting this printed off?

469
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:19,740
Some fucking some fucking indie hipster who owns like the paper is made of organic material?

470
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,900
Why is it $5?

471

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,960
Don't worry, guys.

502
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,820
She ain't welcome in New Zealand.

503
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,660

00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,720
How do I go to the research tab?

507
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,280
How do I go?

508
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:10,780
Well, if the New Zealand police said there was no foul play, then what can I do?

509
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:11,800
You know?

510
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,080
My hands are tied.

511
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,580
Oh, it's in the tool shed.

512
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,420
Oh, there it is.

513
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,500
Hot dog stand.

514
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,720
Hot dog.

515
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,720
Hot dog.

516
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,280
Nice.

517
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,260
Can I be the hot dog stand now?

518
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,840
Oh, I can.

519
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,240
Alright, I'll put it next to the bathroom.

520
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,340
So it'll be like...

521
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,700
So, oh wait, I can't.

522
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,300
I'll put it next to the bathroom.

523
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,380
So if they, you know, after a good...

524
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,820
After a good meal, they can just, you know, use the bathroom right after.

525
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,960
It's so convenient.

526
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,180
The most convenient water park.

527
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,040
There we go.

528
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,380
Uh-oh, your son's at a hot dog.

529
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,300
No one comes to a water park with just the water.

530
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,320
Alright, that's fine.

531
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,520
I'll grab some hot dog.

532
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,640
in my neighboring country, the great Kmart.

533
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,700
Oh wait, let me, all right, hi ma'am, ma'am.

534
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,480

535
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,740
Ma'am, would you also like to become a new citizen of New Zealand?

536
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,120
Sir, sir, would you like to be a, excuse me, New Zealand is not foreign.

537
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,200

538
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,600
Okay, nice, let me grab some hot dogs.

539
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:25,600
Goodbye.

540
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,300
Okay, we're gonna restock the hot dogs real quick.

541
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,260
Not all guests.

542
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,940
Every now and then special guests might show up.

543
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,800
Some loud, some funny, some just plain.

544
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,640
How dare you slander a great nation of New Zealand?

545
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,480
Go to a slave.

546
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,360
That's right.

547
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,020
Did you hear that?

548
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,940
If you're too smelly, you get deported.

549
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,140
Teeing for eight hours.

550
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,660
Bad!

551
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,520
Okay.

552
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:57,880
All right.

553
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,480
Excuse me.

554
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:12,920

00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:45,130
Guys, I have a moral dilemma right now.

558
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:48,530
I can make it back.

559
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:49,850
I think I can make it back.

560
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:51,210
It's fine.

561
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:52,650
I think so.

562
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:53,930
They can't...

563
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,930
Like, I can just perform CPR.

564
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,470
It'll be fine.

565
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,030
Hot dogs bring more joy.

566
00:47:59,210 --> 00:47:59,630
Exactly.

567
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,430
Hot dogs bring more joy.

568
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,890
All right.

Give me a sec.

589
00:48:58,290 --> 00:48:59,290
Where's my other med kit?

590
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,530
There you go.

591
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:02,830
See, she's okay.

592
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:04,990
See, I owe you one.

593
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:05,590

All right, nice.

600
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:26,630
Hello, I shall deport you.

601
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,770

00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,370
Look, you gotta help the Sea Land economy if you wish to be a citizen here.

609
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,110
You can't just outsource it to a different.

610
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,310
We're gonna add tariffs.

611
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:27,290
If you bring outside food and drink, I will tariff it.

612
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,050
That's not the tariff.

I gave you the honor of paying $50 for an immigrant into my great nation.

00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,230
My great micro nation.

618
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,430
How ungrateful.

619
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,970

00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:31,810
Oh wait I need two more.

621
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:32,250

00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,630
Where are all my hot dog enjoyers?

633
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,270
Maybe if I print some more flyers.

634
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,170
Oh, wait.

635
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:02,170

00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,850
I need more like hands or some shit.

638
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:07,090
Why do I have five or inventory slots?

639
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:15,630
I have so many pockets She just how dare you this is how this is slander.

640
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,660
I'll have you trial in my court

641
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,900
All right six hours slide pass.

642
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,080

00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:40,190
Oh, no.

646
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,810
Here's the slide pass.

647
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:44,410
Put the flyers down.

648
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:50,050
Maybe someone would want to... Does anyone want to buy a hot dog?

649
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,110
Hot dogs, yeah.

650
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,070
Get your hot dogs.

651
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,630
Some really delicious hot dogs.

652
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:00,010
See?

653
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:02,210
He knows what's up.

654
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,350
I said it was really delicious.

655
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,030
And He knows what's up.

656
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,070
Sonic, thank you.

657
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,010
In the super chat, thank you.

658
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:14,630
Here comes a new...

659
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:18,450
Okay, but defunct land is based off of amusement parks.

660
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,490
This is the sovereign micro-nation of New Zealand.

661
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:24,670
This is different.

662
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,990
Hot dogs.

663
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,010
Get your hot dogs.

664
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:32,570
Made from premium.

665
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,650
What are hot dogs made of?

666
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:40,110
Made from premium cows, pigs, and other sorts of animals.

667
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,150
Hot dogs, get your hot dogs.

668
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:51,370
In New Zealand, the meat might surprise you.

669
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,390
Oh my god, it's that late.

670
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:00,930
Oh my god, it's that late.

671
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,290
Maybe I should not build my slide at the edge of that pool.

672
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,350
Nah, it's the risk.

673
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,990
The fun of it is the risk that you might break your neck.

674
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:17,290
It's a good souvenir from New Zealand.

675
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,650
It's a good story to tell to your family and friends, you know?

676
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,950
Like, oh man, you want to know how I got these cars?

I just need to sell one more hot dog.

678
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,790
It's like a gambling, exactly.

679
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,630
It's a gambling water park.

680
00:54:36,010 --> 00:55:11,550
with the lawsuits um there's no lawsuits in New Zealand because we have our own sets of laws and you willingly by buying a ticket to New Zealand you willingly decided to agree to the terms of conditions of my nation we do not follow Canadian law we are our own nation in the middle of Canada self-governing party and i am one of and i am the self-governing party

Exactly.

708
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,220

I didn't want you in my country anyway.

00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,440
You don't want to be a citizen.

741
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,400
I don't even want you as a citizen.

742

We don't speak English in New Zealand.

752
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,980
I have to learn an entire new language to run this country.

753
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,180

1068
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:24,420
They didn't sign...

1069
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:25,060
It's not my fault.

1070
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,180
They signed a consent form.

1071
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:32,500
Legally, if they die in sea land, Their bodies just mysteriously disappear.

1072
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,220
It's crazy.

1073
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,640

1074
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,500

1086
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,360
No free lawyers in New Zealand, only paying citizens.

1087
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,440
We gotta raise our GDP.

1088

Oh shit.

1096
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,780

1097
01:21:57,530 --> 01:21:57,860
Oops.

1098
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,680

Who would have thought?

1100
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,160
How was I supposed to know my pool?

1101
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,620
Was it supposed to be Brad?

1102
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:14,440
Oh my god.

1103
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:15,260

1158
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:34,330

Test your product.

1162
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:38,930
That's what they always say.

1163
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:41,630
Let's see.

1164
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:42,890
I think that's good.

1165
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,170
Oh, is one of the showers broken?

1166
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:45,950

Sorry, you may or may not have got cracks.

1172

We don't need a bigger pool.

They can enjoy this one pool here.

1183
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,820
Do you think New Zealand is made out of money?

1184
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,020
We are a growing economy.

1185
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:54,670
Yes.

1186
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:57,870
We are a growing economy.

1187
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:00,630
We have yet to reach First Nation status.

1188
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:03,490
First World.

1189
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:06,470
We have yet to reach first world country.

1190
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:16,210
That is why we are asking for financial assistance from our neighbors and allies.

1191
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,320

1204
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,700
Oh, I have that!

1205
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,060
Wait, how do I...

1206
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,980
That was the first thing I unlocked.

1207
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:52,260
Don't worry.

1208
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:55,060
Be clean!

1209
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,640
Four hours.

1210
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:00,320
Oh, wait.

1211
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,100
I gotta throw this.

1212
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,180
There you go.

1213
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:04,980
Um...

1214
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,120
There you go.

1215
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:08,920
Welcome to New Zealand.

1216
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,000
Hope you enjoy your stay.

1217
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,560
Oh my god, I have so many customers.

1218
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:17,560
They must have heard all the great things about my wonderful sovereign state.

1219
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:21,660
Yeah, we have to get rid of his aura.

1220
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:23,700

01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,260
Enjoy your stay.

1222
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,620
I mean, to be fair, you can literally just go to take a shower.

1223
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,340

1228
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,560
Just sand out of the pipe.

1229
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,240
Oh, shit!

1230
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,460
It's not my fault.

1231
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:22,420
You saw him.

1232
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:23,720
He walked into me.

1233
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,180
Yes.

1234
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,100
I had the right of way.

1235
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:35,040
He walked into my area.

1236
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,780
I'm never a fault.

1237
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,380
I am the law.

1238
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:45,560
Alright, Leonard Six hours, senior.

1239
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,080
Enjoy the complimentary water.

1240
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,140
I'm going to pay your taxes in New Zealand.

1241
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:58,560
Enjoy yourself.

1242
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,660
Oh, I don't even have to advertise my park anymore.

1243
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:05,240
Six hours, adult slide pass.

1244
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:06,220
Enjoy your stay.

1245
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:09,540
I need to shoot some hoops.

1246
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:10,540
Oh, wait.

1247
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,140
Lemonade.

1248
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:12,960
Lemonade.

1249
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:14,000
I want lemonade.

1250
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:14,900
Add ice.

1251
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,340
Enjoy your lemonade.

1252
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:18,320
It's not pee.

1253
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:22,740
Dirt.

1254
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:24,300
Attraction slowly lose and get dirt.

1255
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,200
Use the mop to clean them in the hat.

1256
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:28,440
A shiny water park is a happy water park.

1257
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:28,740
Don't worry.

1258
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:29,440
I got you.

1259
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:31,400
Oh, shit.

1260
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,120
Oh, shit.

1261
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:32,740
Oh, my God.

1262
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,240
Oh, my God.

1263
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:33,980
Please.

1264
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:34,480
Please.

1265
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:35,480
Not in New Zealand.

1266
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:37,600
Can't go back.

1267
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,480
We can't get shut down again.

1268
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:41,640
Clear.

1269
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:42,580
Clear.

1270
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:54,100
Oh, repair damage building.

1271
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:54,840
What's damage?

1272
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:56,440
Hold up, whoa.

1273
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,120
Does this count as repairing it?

1274
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:00,840
Oh, it does.

1275
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:06,890
This is how you repair stuff.

1276
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,990
Just hammer it until things get better.

1277
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:10,910
Okay, don't worry.

1278
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:13,810
She won't get any splinters from this chair.

1279
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:21,150
Jesus, it takes so long to repair, though.

1280
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:24,110
No, it's not.

1281
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,030
They're fine.

1282
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:28,370
It's not my fault they can't aim.

1283
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:33,590
Is it truly my fault if they miss?

1284
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:35,710
They're the ones that can't aim.

1285
01:32:36,650 --> 01:32:38,790
It's like when you miss the toilet when you're peeing.

1286
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:41,490
Is it my fault that you have no aim?

1287
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:42,050
No.

1288
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,940
I'll clean this chair.

1289
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,740
I can clean this while he's there.

1290
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,040
But I don't bump.

1291
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:27,210

Just walk left!

1293
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:37,370
God, we gotta find out where the source of all this water is coming from.

1294
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,260
Alright.

1295
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:44,800
Clean, clean, clean.

1296
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,200
That's everything.

1297
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:47,960
Oh, hot dogs.

1298
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:50,480
Mustard.

1299
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:51,880
Here you go.

1300
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,760
Hope you enjoy our national dish.

1301
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:59,240
Is that everything?

1302
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,540
I feel like cleaned everything.

1303
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,360
Can I clean?

1304
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:05,060
Oh, wait, I forgot I can clean the showers.

1305
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:10,300
I don't understand why my shower is dirty if it's already water.

1306
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,720
Can I clean it while he's showering?

1307
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,040
I don't understand.

1308
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:22,280
How is my shower broken when water is being sprayed on it?

1309
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,340
Spread the love with water gun?

1310
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:27,120
Don't worry.

1311
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,380
I am also a registered priest.

1313
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:09,020
at least at least the national dish has poor options I know isn't it wonderful Don't have to worry about picking.

1314
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:12,580
Less choices.

1315
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:16,060
Enjoy your stay in New Zealand.

1316
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:21,780
For our senior slide pass.

1317
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,120
Hope you enjoy your stay in New Zealand.

1318
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,000
Oh my god.

1319
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:26,500
Who broke my pool?

1320
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:27,600
Oh I could clean my pool.

1321
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,160
Oh my god please I can't get out.

1322
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:33,320
Who took away my ladder?

1323
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:35,240
Well I can clean it from here.

1324
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:38,400
Is there anything?

1325
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:39,760
Oh my god, god damn it.

1326
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,020
It's stupid fucking water.

1327
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:42,560
I'm gonna drain the pool.

1328
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,160
Is that it?

1329
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:47,100
Alright.

1330
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:48,340
Hope you enjoy.

1331
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:49,080
Are you serious?

1332
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:50,560
How did you miss?

1333
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:53,020
The bathroom is literally there.

1334
01:35:57,930 --> 01:36:02,270
Okay, maybe having one bathroom in the entire park might not be the best idea.

1335
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:05,250
Might not be the...

1336
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:08,170
Might not be the smartest.

1337
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,490
thing I've done today.

1338
01:36:12,570 --> 01:36:13,830
Does it take money when I do that?

1339
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:14,570
No, it doesn't.

1340
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:15,030
That's good.

1341
01:36:16,190 --> 01:36:16,850
Pew, pew, pew.

1342
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:21,390
Don't worry, I'm baptizing you.

1343
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:28,150
So now to the C-Land religion.

1344
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:30,850
Welcome to C-Landian.

1345
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:35,370
And I sprayed everybody.

1346
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:37,590
Nice.

1347
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:37,950
Okay.

1348
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:39,290
Now they're fine.

1349
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:41,310
Come on, C-Line.

1350
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:43,430
This is the house, C-Line, baptized.

1351
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,410
I just need someone to be smelly.

1352
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:50,450
Hello.

1353
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:52,930
Are there anyone with aura here?

1354
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:54,930
Oh, wait.

1355
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:56,110
I think I can hire staff now.

1356
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:56,530
Nice.

1357
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:58,970
Alright, staff.

1358
01:36:59,210 --> 01:36:59,450
Open.

1359
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:00,650
Pick your new staff member.

1360
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:01,010
Bring them.

1361
01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:02,810
You have to pay them daily, but they keep their part.

1362
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:04,370
Well, sometimes staff takes breaks.

1363
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:06,010
And when they do, their work simply stops.

1364
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:07,090
Keep an eye on that.

1365
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:08,910
Oh, I have to make sure they never stop.

1366
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,750
So how do I hire people?

1367
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:14,970
Uh, oh, can I take a loan?

1368
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:20,730
We'll hire someone.

1369
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:21,930
Hire.

1370
01:37:23,410 --> 01:37:24,010
Dalton.

1371
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:26,510
Who's the cheapest?

1372
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:27,490
Alright, you.

1373
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:31,730
Efficiency, 87%.

1374
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:32,490
Endurance.

1375
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:33,810
There you go, Lennon.

1376
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:35,450
Congratulations.

1377
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:38,930
You're now a wonderful employee of- Oh, shit!

1378
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:43,560
Oh, I've got you!

1379
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:45,240
I'm a hero.

1380
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,400
Alright, I got my first staff.

1381
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:47,940
Where is he?

1382
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:49,840
Oh, Lenin's doing the thing.

1383
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:51,060
Yay!

1384
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,260
I don't have to handle tickets anymore.

1385
01:38:00,530 --> 01:38:00,830
Nice.

1386
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:01,690
Alright.

1387
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:04,770
I looked at your criteria, Lenin.

1388
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:08,370
And you seem to be the perfect fit for C-Lan.

1389
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:11,150
To be a wonderful diplomatic employee.

1390
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:13,350
And work in government.

1391
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:16,050
I see myself in you, Lenin.

1392
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:42,790
If the only con was that I had to pay you, that's the only criticism because as a wonderful government worker, you should feel honored from just, you should feel honored and required zero pay just for the, just for the fact that you get to work for C-Land matches all the criteria.

1393
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:46,470
The criteria being you were the cheapest of all the C-Land.

1394
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:46,870
staff.

1395
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:52,840
Oh, fuck.

1396
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,180
I keep forgetting that you just weren't playing?

1397
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:57,500
Oh.

1398
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,680
Why is there not five of Lennon?

1399
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:07,520
So I don't have to worry about handling the hot dog sad.

1400
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:10,480
Wait, actually, I could hire five of Lennon.

1401
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,580
I hired this guy.

1402
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:17,000
I did not hire him.

1403
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:18,300

1413
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:41,430
Was I just naked?

1414
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:48,850
Uh...

1415
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:52,890
I want vendor staff, so...

1416
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:54,050
I can't get this.

1417
01:41:54,810 --> 01:41:56,810
Oh, I have to unlock that.

1418
01:41:56,970 --> 01:41:59,270
And then...

1419
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:00,690
Basic trash bin.

1420
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:02,710
Park size.

1421
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:05,850
Wait, how do I unlock number two?

1422
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:09,270
Oh, is that two star?

1423
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:12,770
Oh, it has to be two star.

1424
01:42:13,370 --> 01:42:13,550
Okay.

1425
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:15,670
What star am I at?

1426
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:20,530
Okay, I need to do the smelly guest thing to get two star.

1427
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:22,230
Yeah.

1428
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:26,190
All right, we'll grab this here.

1429
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:29,830
And then we'll put a tree here.

1430
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:32,690
We'll put a chair next to the pool.

1431
01:42:32,810 --> 01:42:35,730
Actually, we'll put it here.

1432
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:41,730
So we can stop the falls, guys.

1433
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:44,450
We can stop it.

1434
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:47,490
This is our cushion.

1435
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:52,290
Finally, we won't have any more accidents now.

1436
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:55,810
The chair will stop their fall.

1437
01:42:58,190 --> 01:42:59,190
I'm a genius.

1438
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:02,330
Modern solution to a modern problem.

1439
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:06,470
Alright.

1440
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:08,070
Yeah, exactly.

1441
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:11,070
The slide down, it'll be a sick trick shot.

1442
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:12,070
It'll be like an Ollie.

1443
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:18,090
Like, and then they get in the pool.

1444
01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:20,310
It'll be a sick trick shot, guys.

1445
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:21,490
It'll be too...

1446
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:23,250
It'll be too bitter.

1447
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:31,750
I think Tony Hawk will be impressed when he sees this.

1448
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:40,300
It's the bridge between this trash can and that trash can.

1449
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:44,900
I don't see any difference between the two.

1450
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:49,000
Tony Hawk's water park.

1451
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:51,820
Alright, Lennon.

1452
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,720
Do your job.

1453
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:55,740
I should really get...

1454
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:56,020
Oh, wait.

1455
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:56,680
I can customize.

1456
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:57,280
Oh, my God.

1457
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,740
Customize my character.

1458
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:00,060
Guys, I got a new haircut.

1459
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,060

1460
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:03,160

1461
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:03,940

Oh, Mach, this is an aerial strike.

1467
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:55,210
This is an aerial strike.

1468
01:44:56,670 --> 01:44:58,930
I got hurled in emergency meeting.

1469
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:06,200
Where's my anti-air artillery?

1470
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:13,480
The great, the great sea land war.

1471
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,960
The foreign invaders.

1472
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:34,640
Tragul's return fire Okay, I'll clean this Oh, okay Oh, it's the key What the fuck happened?

1474
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:48,530
Can we clean this?

1475
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,270
Like, why is it green?

1476
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:52,510
Why is this green?

1477
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:56,870
That's alright.

1478
01:45:56,970 --> 01:45:59,650
As long as they don't see this part of the...

1479
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:01,670
Everything will be fine.

1480
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:03,930
As long as they don't see this part of the park.

1481
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:06,750
It should be fine.

1482
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:09,630
Are there any more people?

1483
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:10,510
Okay, there is.

1484
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:13,870
Don't worry, I'll baptize him in the name of Sea Land.

1485
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:17,790
Alright, we need one more and then we'll have five stars.

1486
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:20,530
Oh my god, there's so much work.

1487
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:21,870
Do you think they'll see this?

1488
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:23,250

1492
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:40,410
Why do you need, like, five more for more points?

1493
01:47:43,570 --> 01:47:44,710

Oh, nice.

1500
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:54,190
I got a research point.

1501
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:56,970
Uh...

1502
01:47:57,550 --> 01:47:58,730
Yeah, I'm going to save up.

1503
01:47:58,970 --> 01:48:01,350
I want to save up for the vendor staff.

1504
01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:03,810
See, look at that.

1505
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:05,110
Now he's so brave.

1506
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:09,370
So brave.

1507
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:10,410
Oh, shit.

1508
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:11,280
I didn't want to destroy it.

1509
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:15,930
Trying to see if there's any more trash for me to throw.

1510
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,600
Well, here you go.

1511
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:24,580
Enjoy our national cuisine.

1512
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:28,500
He's fine.

1513
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:29,840
He's so healthy.

1514
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:32,260
He signed a consent form, too.

1515
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:33,700
So it's okay.

1516
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,860
We're legally safe.

1517
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:38,500
So don't worry, dragons.

1518
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:42,520
Our feudal country exists from any lawsuit.

1519
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:45,600
What are you doing?

1520
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:46,140
Lenin?

1521
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:46,800
Lenin.

1522
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:47,660
What are you doing?

1523
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:48,620
Lenin?

1524
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:49,560
Yes.

1525
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:50,500
Go back.

1526
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:53,640
Lenin.

1527
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:54,340
Lenin.

1528
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:55,520
Why are you leaving?

1529
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:59,320
By becoming a government worker, you're not allowed to leave.

1530
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:11,180
Lennon go back in You are not allowed To leave this country Oh my god You got injured on the bench How what happened?

1531
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,740
Who could have done such a thing?

1532
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:18,060
Lennon you're supposed to Chase you're supposed to do a trick shot

1533
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:25,600
No Why is he taking a lunch break Outside the country?

1534
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,420
Does he not enjoy our national dish?

1535
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:31,400
That's right, Lennon.

1536
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,220
You're here forever.

1537
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,780
He fell the cliff.

1538
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:39,940
That's right.

1539
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:44,760
You think you can leave New Zealand now that you know our government secrets?

1540
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:48,840
Lennon is tired.

1541
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:50,960
He's so tired.

1542
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:53,820
All right, here's a lemonade.

1543
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,200
Oh, shit.

1544
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,200
I gotta fix the chairs.

1545
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:04,580
How How could you ever get tired of hot dogs?

1546
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,660
You put ketchup or mustard.

1547
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,500
And if you're feeling extra wild, you could put both.

1548
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:12,180
Look at the varieties that we have.

1549
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:16,600
That's so much variety.

1550
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:25,470
Alright.

1551
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:28,250
Six hours.

1552
01:50:29,230 --> 01:50:29,610
Teen.

1553
01:50:29,850 --> 01:50:30,190
Oh my god.

1554
01:50:30,350 --> 01:50:30,570
For hours.

1555
01:50:30,710 --> 01:50:31,290

01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:34,770
Minimum wage.

1558
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:35,470
Right.

1559
01:50:36,090 --> 01:50:37,530
After Lenin took over.

1560
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:38,530
It was so nice.

1561
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:41,350
I forgot what this was like.

1562
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:46,510
Guess we waited too long.

1563
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:47,650
Leonard is panicking.

1564
01:50:48,150 --> 01:50:49,490
Leonard, you're holding the line up.

1565
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:50,510
Get in that pool.

1566
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:56,090
We have paying citizens here.

1567
01:50:57,590 --> 01:50:58,110
Oh, shit.

1568
01:50:58,410 --> 01:50:59,190
Oh, my God.

1569
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:01,070

01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:03,190

1571
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:04,230
Trick shot.

1572
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:05,390
Oh, shit.

1573
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:10,650

1588
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:35,780

We all saw it, guys.

1590
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:41,300
He slipped outside of the border.

1591
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:47,220
And then I, as a hero, he slipped here.

1592
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:53,500
inside our country so I could perform CPR.

1593
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:55,740
We all saw that.

1594
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:02,660
I am a hero.

1595
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:09,760

01:53:50,730 --> 01:53:53,450

01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:07,970
You don't get paid on Doki Day.

1621
01:56:09,370 --> 01:56:12,390
Because the honor of working on the day.

1622

1627
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:57,120
at my park.

1628
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:05,360
I wonder how that's happening.

1629
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:10,560
Oh, new research point.

1630
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:11,160

1632
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,240

1633
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:19,920

01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:22,800
I'm repairing.

01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:26,220
And now clean.

1636
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:28,160
Yeah!

1637
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:34,020
Oh my god, it's so dirty.

1638
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:36,140
Like, what are they doing to my benches?

1639
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:41,300
Oh, they're disgusting sweaty bodies doing to my benches.

1640
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:46,400
Honestly, it's a skill diff if you get injured in my part.

1641
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:53,160
It is up to code.

1642
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,680
It's up to C-Land code.

1643
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,100
Clean, clean, clean.

1644
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:00,840
Clean, clean.

1645
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:04,780
Like, are you fucking, like, pooping on my chairs?

1646
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:06,240
Like, why are they...

1647
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:08,020
It's been one day.

1648
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:12,220
Why is it like this?

1649
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,540
Yeah, I think that's clean.

1650
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:20,700
I think everything's clean now.

1651
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:22,900
Society!

1652
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:25,820
Thank you for the super chat.

1653
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:26,660
Thank you, thank you.

1654
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:27,960
Naked, jingo, jingo.

1655
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,760
Yeah, the people here are so fucking dirty.

1656
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:38,220
It's like they came to my pool and, like, didn't shower.

1657
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:44,640
Everything is good.

1658
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,320
Oh, shit.

1659
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:47,560
Oh, I can sit on the chair.

1660
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,160
Where am I?

1661
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:48,940
Oh, okay.

1662
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,220
It's because I was like, am I sitting on my chair?

1663
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:56,260
Alright.

1664
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:57,500
Everything's fixed.

1665
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:02,400
I literally need one guy with aura so I can get two stars.

1666
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:15,300
Look, if you guys want handouts, go to a gym.

1667
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:19,360
This is a luxury.

1668
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:22,880
Go to a gym if you want handouts.

1669
01:59:29,330 --> 01:59:31,270
All right, I'll fix my one bathroom.

1670
01:59:33,690 --> 01:59:35,270
I'll fix this too.

1671
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:40,330
Yay.

1672
01:59:41,850 --> 01:59:42,930
Hammer, hammer.

1673
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:47,800
Oh my god.

1674
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:49,460
There must be an upgrade where I can upgrade.

1675
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:49,980
faster.

1676
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:52,280
Or I could hammer faster.

1677
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:55,080
It's like so fucking long.

1678
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:59,320
We're on my cleaning crew.

1679
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,520
Lenin, please work a little faster, Lenin.

1680
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:08,280
Lenin, I see a lie.

1681
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:11,680
I do not pay you $100 a day.

1682
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:13,920
Wait, he gets paid $100 a day?

1683
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,640
Oh my god!

1684
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:18,980
You're a...

1685
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:24,680
How is that?

1686
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:25,180
Oh shit.

1687
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:29,380
Lenin, why are you trying to take a hundred dollars from me?

1688
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:38,580
And it's a hundred dollars euros too, because that is the national currency of Sealand.

1689
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,640
I'll teach him a lesson.

1690
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:51,560
If he's gonna take a hundred dollars from me every day, He's gonna take $200 a day from me.

1691
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:55,080
I'm gonna make sure he spends that when you're even at the hospital.

1692
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:01,130
Wait, where's the shower?

1693
02:01:01,290 --> 02:01:01,750
It's broken?

1694
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:03,950
Which one?

1695
02:01:04,050 --> 02:01:04,750
This one?

1696
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:10,270
What thing's broken?

1697
02:01:11,470 --> 02:01:12,290
He lied!

1698
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:15,770
They're lying!

1699
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:18,190
Oh, shit.

1700
02:01:19,610 --> 02:01:20,670
You still want your lemonade?

1701
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:21,490
Ma'am?

1702
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:23,570
Ma'am, do you still want your lemonade?

1703
02:01:25,170 --> 02:01:26,050
Oh, nice.

1704
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:26,770
That's good.

1705
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:28,130
She still wants it.

1706
02:01:30,310 --> 02:01:30,990
Oh, shit.

1707
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:34,130
Oh, wait, not that.

1708
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:35,890
I got you, sir.

1709
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:36,650
Oh, shit.

1710
02:01:37,070 --> 02:01:37,890
I got you.

1711
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:40,370
Clear.

1712
02:01:41,410 --> 02:01:42,270
I saved them.

1713
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:43,170
Oh, fuck.

1714
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:53,180
Guys, please do not jump in an empty pool.

1715
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:54,020
This is a Darwin.

1716
02:01:54,260 --> 02:01:56,080
This is a Darwin test right now.

1717
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,200
All right, nice.

1718
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:03,680
Oh my god.

1719
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:04,800
Thank god, finally.

1720
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:06,100
Yay!

1721
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,540
Start earning top of your guess, the better.

1722
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:13,140
Yay!

1723
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:14,340
Am I two star?

1724
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:18,600
Unlocked to swim, still not two star?

1725
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:24,090
Slurring guess, get free.

1726
02:02:24,150 --> 02:02:24,950
Nothing hits the spot.

1727
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:26,110
Set up a lemonade side.

1728
02:02:26,670 --> 02:02:27,850
Where's my two star?

1729
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:29,070
Oh, shit.

1730
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,470
Uh.

1731
02:02:30,850 --> 02:02:34,070
Okay, somebody spilled lemonade in front of my lemonade stand.

1732
02:02:34,590 --> 02:02:36,410
I thought I was too star.

1733
02:02:36,590 --> 02:02:37,390
Oh, fuck.

1734
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:38,750
Don't worry.

1735
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:39,330
She's still alive.

1736
02:02:39,450 --> 02:02:40,230
She's still breathing.

1737
02:02:41,410 --> 02:02:42,850
She's still breathing, guys.

1738
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:47,580
Don't worry.

1739
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:49,840
I'm slowly heading over.

1740
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:50,460
Clear.

1741
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:54,520
Oh, God.

1742
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:55,760
Oh, God.

1743
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:56,180
Don't worry.

1744
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:56,620
It's okay.

1745
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:57,860
It's okay.

1746
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,160
Just a normal day.

1747
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,060

1748
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:04,260

02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:08,580
Just lemonade, plain old lemonade?

02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:09,320

1752
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:11,980

Homegrown in our beautiful country.

02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:29,340
There you go.

1758
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:34,200

1760
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:58,160
nicely squeezed not bottled our

1761
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:12,390
soil is very nutritious very organic we make sure the lemons are fed with the best grains possible.

1762
02:04:14,290 --> 02:04:14,710
It's grass.

1763
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:16,790
It's grass fed, guys.

1764
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:23,800
Come on, you know, you want to get some lemon in.

1765
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:26,400
Thank God.

1766
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:27,780
It's grass fed.

1767
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:31,140
Come on.

1768
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:34,540
Lemon in.

1769
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:39,300
Any lemon in, enjoyers?

1770
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:41,340
Lemon in.

1771
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,040
Lemonade enjoyers!

1772
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:46,420
Hello, hello!

1773
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:54,140
Come on, would you like some wonderfully organic lemonade that was grown right here in the great micro-nation of New Zealand?

1774
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:56,120
Come on!

1775
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:57,460
You know you want to...

1776
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:58,380
Oh, I wish there was physics.

1777
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:00,920
I would push you into my lemonade stand.

1778
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:04,000
Hello, everyone!

1779
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:05,660
Lemonade!

1780
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:09,120
Get your lemonade!

1781
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:15,780
Each purchase of lemonade saves a starving child in Africa.

1782
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:18,120
Lemonade.

1783
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:21,880
If you don't buy my lemonade, you want that starving child to die.

1784
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:25,440
You want that?

1785
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:28,100
Lemonade.

1786
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:34,960
Oh my god.

1787
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:36,320
These guys are fucked up.

1788
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:37,600
I can't believe it.

1789
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:40,480
They don't want to save a starving child.

1790
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:45,880
Yes, and...

1791
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:48,660
I can't believe it.

1792
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:50,980
It's so cruel.

1793
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:57,000
They're all people here just want to waste my water.

1794
02:05:57,820 --> 02:05:59,180
They're so selfish.

1795
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:04,480
So fucking selfish.

1796
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:05,900
Think of the children.

1797
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:11,120
It's like when they don't want to donate 99 cents.

1798
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,800
Why are you bored?

1799
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:19,360
I have all the basic necessities.

1800
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:20,840
Why are you bored?

1801
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:22,920
That's right.

1802
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:24,500
Regret everything.

1803
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:27,140
Hey, mustard.

1804
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:28,260
Watch your mustard.

1805
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:32,330
He needs a nap.

1806
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,200
Watch your cleanness.

1807
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:37,100
Yeah.

1808
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:41,020
Have fun now.

1809
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:43,800
Why

1810
02:06:47,190 --> 02:06:49,370
does everyone want hot dogs?

1811
02:06:54,020 --> 02:06:55,920
Does no one want lemonade so more?

1812
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:00,640
Lemmaids are so good.

1813
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:06,410
Someone please.

1814
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:08,630
Buy lemonade.

1815
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:10,770
Please enjoy.

1816
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:13,670
Buy my lemonade now and enjoy yourself.

1817
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:17,010
I don't understand.

1818
02:07:17,330 --> 02:07:18,770
I just want to be two stars.

1819
02:07:20,770 --> 02:07:28,910
the one time i wanted to actually fucking buy lemonade they don't buy lemonade i should put an umbrella here just because i can

1820
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:58,460
why is he what is she thinking of hey what is that even you're right maybe i get more customers or get more get more people to immigrate to my country hello come to my country Hello, anyone want to revoke their citizenship and immigrate to New Zealand?

1821
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:02,640
We have a lot of taxes, but that's the best part.

1822
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:08,520
Oh, you're so right.

1823
02:08:08,780 --> 02:08:10,860
We need, like, five lemonade scents.

1824
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:12,300
So they'll buy...

1825
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:13,420
You're so right, guys.

1826
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:14,780
If I have...

1827
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:19,600
If I have five lemonade scents, they'll make them want to buy more lemonade.

1828
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:20,460
You're so right.

1829
02:08:21,320 --> 02:08:22,060
There you go.

1830
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:39,820
subliminal messaging you know it's so subtle the more lemonade stands there are the more the one to buy it it's the most subtle marketing tactic you can do

1831
02:08:43,110 --> 02:08:53,770
I like but hello I need to put some more lemons in my lemonade stand surely this will work

1832
02:08:59,020 --> 02:08:59,980
Oh, it's because of all the...

1833
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:01,840
I was going to say, how did I lose money?

1834
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:02,660
I think I bought...

1835
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:07,380
Guys, I may or may not have bought too many lemonade stands.

1836
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:11,280
Maybe.

1837
02:09:11,420 --> 02:09:12,380
I'm not sure yet.

1838
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:15,900
Guys, I'm not sure yet.

1839
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:19,340
I may or may not have bought too many lemonade stands.

1840
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:21,340
I don't know.

1841
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:27,580
I'm unsure.

1842
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:33,120
Alright, let's see.

1843
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,360
No, Lenin is... This is all he has.

1844
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:41,980
He can't leave the country anymore, so he's here forever.

1845
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:46,580
I should repair my toilet.

1846
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:52,080
It's okay.

1847
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:52,580
It's okay.

1848
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:56,200
Sometimes people leave, like, money on the floor.

1849
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:02,240
Alright.

1850
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:04,540
I repaired everything.

1851
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:10,440
Alright.

1852
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:12,100
I mean, the chairs are not...

1853
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:13,860
That badly broken.

1854
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:16,500
Just need to mop them a little bit.

1855
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:19,880
It's okay.

1856
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,200
We're open now.

1857
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:23,340
Come on.

1858
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:24,020
Oh, shit.

1859
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:27,820
Oh, my God.

1860
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:28,420
Keep slipping.

1861
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:33,080
Like, this has to be, like, the most slamiest floor ever.

1862
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,380
There's no way that's water.

1863
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:37,180
I refuse to believe that's water.

1864
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:47,700
I gotta go to, like, Wee!

1865
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:50,640
See, I don't understand how people can get injured from that.

1866
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:55,940
It feels so safe.

1867
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:02,380
Is this clean?

1868
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:05,200
I think that's clean.

1869
02:11:05,860 --> 02:11:06,880
Oh, yeah, I should stir that away.

1870
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:10,020
Oh, shit.

1871
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:15,780
No, I don't even... I thought I hid it.

1872
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,140
All right.

1873
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:20,560
Oh, nice.

1874
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:22,240
The customers are coming in.

1875
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:24,540
Is that this you?

1876
02:11:24,940 --> 02:11:25,780
Get out of here.

1877
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:31,420
We don't welcome you to New Zealand.

1878
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:36,420
Does anyone want lemon in?

1879
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:38,760
Oh, wait.

1880
02:11:38,860 --> 02:11:39,340
We need another.

1881
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:40,780
Okay, nice.

1882
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:42,720
I can finally afford more lemon in.

1883
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:45,780
All right.

1884
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:50,240
Now, surely...

1885
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:57,880
Surely I have enough customers to buy lemonade now.

1886
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:02,240
Hey guys.

1887
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:06,460
Look at, yay, five thought.

1888
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:07,660
Look, she had a good time.

1889
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:09,720
She did a good, she did a trick shot.

1890
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:11,580
And she enjoyed herself.

1891
02:12:16,620 --> 02:12:18,380
It's a lemon eat lemon world.

1892
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:24,020
I wonder if the slide was supposed to be closer to the water.

1893
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:44,620
I don't know.

1894
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:51,180
I guess we'll never know.

1895
02:12:51,820 --> 02:12:53,700
Guys, we'll never know.

1896
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:56,620
Why would...

1897
02:12:56,620 --> 02:12:57,100
Yeah, it's like...

1898
02:12:57,120 --> 02:13:17,840

That's where the money starts rolling.

1901
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:06,400
It's the color read.

1902
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,620
When was the last time you swapped?

1903
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:10,340
We don't talk about that.

1904
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:11,800
What are you, a cop?

1905
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:14,000
Why are you asking?

1906
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:18,860
Lemonade?

1907
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:20,980
Lemonade?

1908
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:24,900
Hello.

1909
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:26,160

Okay, it didn't explode.

1931
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:18,900

02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:39,540
Why are so many people getting injured in my park?

1940
02:16:40,380 --> 02:16:41,540
I don't understand.

1941
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:44,960
So many weak-ass citizens.

1942
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:47,600
We need to train them.

1943
02:16:49,620 --> 02:16:51,620
How am I receiving a fine?

1944
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:56,740

This is what our part needed.

1949
02:17:11,770 --> 02:17:12,050
Alright.

1950
02:17:13,090 --> 02:17:14,170

1952
02:17:18,470 --> 02:17:20,210
How can this business plan fail?

1953
02:17:27,630 --> 02:17:29,550
There's no way this can fail.

1954
02:17:30,490 --> 02:17:32,230
This is a beautiful business plan.

1955
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:35,230

We're too big to fail.

1959
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:44,860
Oh shit, she wants hot.

1960
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:47,520

1970
02:18:51,570 --> 02:18:53,770
I have maximum amount of guests, though.

1971
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:55,190
I don't need to advertise.

1972
02:19:00,610 --> 02:19:00,790
Alright.

1973
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:01,510

Yeah, I'll grab that.

1979
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:15,430
I like more money.

1980
02:19:16,810 --> 02:19:20,150
I don't have to change anything, and they'll just willingly pay me more money.

1985
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:34,000

Four out of five stars.

1993
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:57,160
The slide was too far from the pool.

1994
02:19:57,560 --> 02:20:02,660
I ended up scraping my back and banging my head on the concrete while the owner watched.

1995
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:05,080
The lemonade was okay though.

1996
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:06,940
So for... See, look at that!

1997
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:10,060
Look, I'm sorry, but like, that's a skill issue.

1998
02:20:10,140 --> 02:20:13,280
Look, she hit the pool just fine.

1999
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:18,940
I'm sorry, but that's just a skill issue.

2000
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:22,880

2001
02:20:27,550 --> 02:20:29,170

02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:01,270

2012
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:02,010

We didn't go under.

2018
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:15,050
We didn't go negative.

2019
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:17,650
So that's already a good day.

2020
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:28,320

Got to fix that.

2023
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:43,350
And then sweep, sweep, sweep.

2024
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:45,070
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

2025
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:46,730

Okay, it should stay cleaner longer now, too.

2030

02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:56,670
It's okay, just a little heart attack.

2036
02:23:59,870 --> 02:24:01,070
That's just business.

2037
02:24:05,150 --> 02:24:09,930
You know you're a hard worker when you get one or two heart attacks.

2038
02:24:11,090 --> 02:24:12,890
That's when you know you're doing something right.

2039
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:16,070
It builds character.

2040
02:24:17,930 --> 02:24:18,870
Okay, that's not a new one.

Okay, I'll break this.

2089
02:28:38,630 --> 02:28:39,690
No hot dogs, sir.

2090
02:28:40,430 --> 02:28:41,390
No hot dogs.

2091
02:28:41,630 --> 02:28:43,230
I built the wrong one.

2092
02:28:46,350 --> 02:28:47,130
There we go.

2093
02:28:47,550 --> 02:28:48,070
Now!

2094
02:28:48,770 --> 02:28:49,730
Now it's perfect.

2095
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:51,850
Sir, give me a sec.

2096
02:28:52,090 --> 02:28:52,770

2097
02:28:52,770 --> 02:28:53,570
Give me a sec.

2098
02:28:58,640 --> 02:28:59,240
Yeah.

2099
02:29:02,070 --> 02:29:02,670
Okay.

2100
02:29:03,170 --> 02:29:03,490
Clear!

2101
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:05,430
Alright, nice.

2102
02:29:05,610 --> 02:29:06,150
I'm a hero.

2103
02:29:07,050 --> 02:29:08,350
I'll fix this bathroom.

2104
02:29:10,630 --> 02:29:14,490
But there will never be a lemon shortage in New Zealand.

2105
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:17,930
We grow our...

2106
02:29:17,930 --> 02:29:19,210
We grow every lemon.

2107
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:22,810
To avoid that.

2108
02:29:27,420 --> 02:29:28,820
What the fuck keeps...

2109
02:29:28,820 --> 02:29:29,780
I have a...

2110
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:30,400
Oh, it's because...

2111
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:30,820
Whoops, sorry.

2112
02:29:30,980 --> 02:29:31,480
I forgot that.

2113
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:34,300
Alright.

2114
02:29:37,180 --> 02:29:40,400

2123
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:51,310
How could you say that?

2124
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:53,150
How could you say destroy the hot dogs?

2125
02:31:54,850 --> 02:31:55,510
Or the lemons?

2126
02:31:56,150 --> 02:31:59,030
This is our main source of economy

2127
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:05,160
that.

2128
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:12,060
I need the loungers that are one point that are what?

2129
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:18,600
Build zero to five for at least one prestige.

2130
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:21,620
What is one prestige?

2131
02:32:26,840 --> 02:32:28,840
What is considered one prestige?

2132
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:36,040
Like one star?

2133
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:39,160
I mean, there's one star on this chair.

2134
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:41,120
Is that not count?

2135
02:32:45,340 --> 02:32:46,620
Oh, that doesn't count?

2136
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:50,100
But that's one star.

2137
02:32:52,160 --> 02:32:53,220
This should count, right?

2138
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:56,080
Oh, it doesn't.

2139
02:32:56,540 --> 02:32:57,640
I guess I'll destroy it.

2140
02:33:00,740 --> 02:33:01,780
God, I'll destroy it.

2141
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:02,380
It doesn't count.

2142
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:03,020
Oh, shit.

2143
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:05,100
Oh, shit!

2144
02:33:09,250 --> 02:33:10,050
It's okay.

2145
02:33:10,430 --> 02:33:11,570
I got you, man!

2146
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:14,170
You're fine!

2147
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:16,410
Would you like some lemonade too.

2148
02:33:24,500 --> 02:33:25,780
Wait, what do I have to unlock?

2149
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:27,800
Park.

2150
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:29,720
Oh, basic loungers.

2151
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:30,400
This one?

2152
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:36,540
Oh, I see.

2153
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:38,500
Okay, I need five.

2154
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:44,300
One, two, three, four, five.

2155
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:44,940
There you go.

2156
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:47,360
That should give me two stars, right?

2157
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,900
Oh my god, moving up in the world.

2158
02:33:52,720 --> 02:34:26,940
one two three four am I two star yay I got my second start guys see ignore what they say about my pie about how it's dangerous and and a crime against humanity.

2159
02:34:27,660 --> 02:34:29,140
They still gave me...

2160
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:29,340
Oh, wait.

2161
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:30,260
Almost...

2162
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:30,260
Oh.

2163
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:31,500
Oh.

2164
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:33,160
Good.

2165
02:34:33,360 --> 02:34:34,680
If you round up, it's what?

2166
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:35,380
Two stars.

2167
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:41,980
I take those.

2168
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:43,800
I round it up.

2169
02:34:44,180 --> 02:34:46,020
I rounded it up.

2170
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:49,820
And so I never doubted it.

2171
02:34:52,380 --> 02:34:54,420
It still counts.

2172
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:58,940
It did not kill anyone.

2173
02:34:59,460 --> 02:35:00,980
Maybe they can't walk again.

2174
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:03,360
But there was no deaths.

2175
02:35:03,780 --> 02:35:04,260
There was...

2176
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:12,380
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

2177
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:13,420
Thank you.

2178
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:16,340
The super medic simulator chair looks fun.

2179
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:19,400
Someone should probably arrest the owner of the water park, though.

2180
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:21,580
Thank God this isn't a water park.

2181
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:22,780
It's just a sovereign...

2182
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:23,980
Oh my God!

2183
02:35:24,660 --> 02:35:32,510
Oh my god, oh my god, wait, wait

2184
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:41,680
Everything is fine

2185
02:35:47,180 --> 02:36:00,760
Nothing happened Everything is fine She was just drunk and called her friend to pick her up Guys, she was drinking at the...

2186
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:02,220
Don't drink and drink Swim.

2187
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:04,620
Don't drink and swim, guys.

2188
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:06,740
Don't...

2189
02:36:09,240 --> 02:36:11,200
No one died.

2190
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:13,020
Hey, guys.

2191
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:14,100
I'm fun.

2192
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:15,640
I'm going to call it here.

2193
02:36:17,380 --> 02:36:21,980
But I hope you guys had a lot of fun today.

2194
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:29,440
Watching me expand the great sovereign micro state.

2195
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:30,760
Sea land.

2196
02:36:31,740 --> 02:36:34,640
And enjoyed watching me run New Zealand.

2197
02:36:38,180 --> 02:36:39,640
Glory to New Zealand.

2198
02:36:40,400 --> 02:36:42,640
Glory to the Duchess of Jokie Bane.

2199
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:44,860
Thank you all for watching.

2200
02:36:46,060 --> 02:36:49,080
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

2201
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:50,340
Foster check.

2202
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:53,340
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2203
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:55,940
If you step for me, head to bed.

2204
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:57,720
Because you deserve it.

2205
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:59,880
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2206
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:01,720
Bye, guys.

02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:02,920
