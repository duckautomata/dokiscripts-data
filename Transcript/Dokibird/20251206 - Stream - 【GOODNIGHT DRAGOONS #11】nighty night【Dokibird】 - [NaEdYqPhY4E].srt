10
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,800

11
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,940
I knew I forgot something.

12
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,260
So I had to get food.

13
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,500
I went out to eat because I wanted to treat myself for, you
know, beating a video game.

14
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,600
I was like, I did it.

15
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,560
Oh, my God.

16
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,720
I beat a video game.

17
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,320
I got to treat myself for a job well done.

18
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,840
Oh, such good hard work, Doki.

19
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,380
You worked so hard beating that video game on stream.

20
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,260
You did so well, Doki.

21
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,100
Letting that lady die so you could live.

22
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,480
I mean, she was dead anyway, but not saving her life.

23
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,040
Good job, Doki.

24
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,600
Treat yourself.

25
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,820
For real.

26
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,820
Okay, but honestly, bro, okay.

27
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,480
That's so weird because I remember I was just thinking like
the no players online.

28
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,200
I was like, is that what coders do?

29
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:20,520
Like, like basically it's like, bro, I don't know what's
going on with the coding.

30
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,240
the same bugs and there you guys like look bro you forgot to
transfuse the soul of an eight-year-old girl and that's why

31
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:37,340
your texture isn't loading properly I'm like what the I'm
like what the fuck yes they some they make the deal with the

32
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:49,000
moussein to be able to code anything like yeah it's so
accurate exactly that's why all the coders are always so

33
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,440
fucking depressed because they sold their soul to

34
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,520
Of course, it's so simple.

35
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,100
You have to appease the machine spirits.

36
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,040
Also, I watched the newest episode of Fiona and Cake.

37
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,220
I don't know how to feel about the series.

38
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,280
I don't know.

39
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,360
I think season one was really good because, like, you know,
you haven't seen, you get to see, like, the, you get to see,

40
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,660
like, the original cast.

41
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,720
of adventure time again you know with like fiona not fiona
sorry uh with like princess bubblegum marceline and finn and

42
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,280
stuff like that and then introduced like fiona they
reintroduced fiona and kate but it's i i do not like fiona

43
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:50,100
no she's a bitch like i really don't like her um she's just
so unlikable but finn is so likable that's the thing it

44
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,960
makes me really sad because you know you're She's not Finn.

45
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,960
She's like Fiona.

46
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:05,880
She's her own character, but she's like, she's such, I don't
know She's like they gave her so many flaws that she's just

47
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:13,120
unlikable as a character in itself Because she does, you
know, you're like, oh, she's very very flawed, but I'm like,

48
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,520
yeah, she's so fucking flawed that I don't even want her as
a friend like I don't even she seems like a terrible friend

49
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,660
like Who?

50
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:35,560
Okay, so if anyone knows Adventure Time, so everyone knows
Adventure Time, right?

51
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:44,000
Like the Pendleton Ward series where at first it was just
like, at first it was just like each episode, it's his own

52
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,440
thing.

53
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,320
And it's just like whimsical adventures of a little boy and
his dog.

54
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,820
And then they end up making it more and more plot heavy.

55
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,820
And then you found out, oh my God, it's based off of like
earth after like maybe like a couple thousand years after

56
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,240
like a nuclear bomb exploded on earth um and then like what
happens with that with the last surviving human quote

57
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,500
unquote um and everything and it's just it's just like crazy
adventures and everything and there's like a lot later on i

58
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,020
got a lot better but i introduced like actual plot into the
show because no one expected it um and then a lot of like

59
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,740
character building and stuff and it was a

60
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:32,260
those who don't know um we wouldn't have event we wouldn't
have all the modern cartoon shows like modern cartoon shows

61
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:41,140
that everyone talks about now if it wasn't for flapjack
because all of the current modern cartoons that are that's

62
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:49,040
our beloved basically you can trace it back to flapjack
because all the all the show renders come from flapjack and

63
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:58,060
then from flapjack the current modern okay i won't say like
modern cartoons like i think adventure time is like um last

64
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:05,600
gen's modern cartoon now the current gen cartoon comes from
adventure time so a lot of the current showrunners actually

65
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:14,260
come from adventure time but um last gen last gen's modern
like cartoon shows that were beloved came from flapjack and

66
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,180
i know it's like a weird chart like if you look through a
flow chart of all the shit where all they come where they

67
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:28,380
all come from like all the showrunners trace it all the way
back to flapjack um anyway anyway sorry off topic uh also my

68
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:35,060
brain is frazzled at the moment because it is 9 p.m and i am
a little tired because i had lots of food so i'm on a food

69
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:46,200
coma right now um anyway so adventure time ended it was a
really good finale um all the songs are very memorable and

70
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:55,980
everything um it was very sad that the ending to it was very
sad and then a couple like you know a couple years passed by

71
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:04,100
and they're like we're gonna bring adventure time back but
we're uh it's gonna be told through fiona and cake um but

72
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:12,920
the modern um the characters you love so much will will uh
will make a comeback in fiona and cake so people were so

73
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:22,620
curious you're like oh how are the characters like how is
finn like princess babaga marceline uh jake all come back in

74
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,960
in Fiona cake because Fiona cake is an alternate universe
gender bent version of Jake and Finn so people were so

75
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:36,520
fucking confused they're like what do you mean um like
they're gonna make appearances in Fiona cake so they

76
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:47,720
basically basically it's really weird so beyond the premise
it's a little bit of spoilery but Fiona and cake is like

77
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,260
basically uh Simon who was Ice King.

78
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,300
I know some of you guys were like, oh, I never watched this.

79
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,120
Like, I never watched Adventure Time.

80
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,980
So, like, what the fuck is she talking about?

81
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
But bear with me.

82
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:10,400
So, Fiona Cake is actually a fan fiction that the Ice King
slash Simon, that's his actual name, came from.

83
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,980
So, it's all in his mind.

84
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,720
So, the entire world of Fiona and Cake comes from The Ice
King's Mine.

85
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,860
And then Prismo, who is like, I guess like the guardian of
the universe or what?

86
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,420
Okay, I know.

87
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,860
It gets very confusing.

88
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:40,900
So Prismo, who is like the guardian of the universe, and he
can grant wishes and stuff, he likes to watch too.

89
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,660
So apparently, he really loved the world of Fiona and cake.

90
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,600
So he made it real.

91
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,480
So Prismo was like, I love Fiona and Cake.

92
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,660
Okay, by the way, apparently Fiona and Cake comes from
Prismo.

93
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,040
Okay, this is where it gets super complicated.

94
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,920
So this is what we originally thought.

95
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,860
We're like, oh, Prismo saved Fiona and Cake's world because
he loves Fiona and Cake.

96
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,300
But in actuality, Prismo was the one that created Fiona and
Cake.

97
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:25,060
to create universes because that's against the rules because
he's only allowed to watch he's not allowed to create um so

98
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,940
so he didn't want to get in trouble with like the universe
police you know like it's like the time police but instead

99
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:39,560
of the time police it's the universe police so he didn't
want to get in trouble so so he is like i will put this

100
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,580
world of fiona and cake because he was like i'm gonna create
my original content but instead he just it's like it's like

101
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,620
uh 50 shades of where they were like, I'm going to create my
original content, but it was just the fan fiction of

102
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:50,900
Twilight.

103
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,460
So it's basically like that.

104
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,680
So he's like, I'm going to create an original content.

105
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,420
And he ended up just creating, like, adventure time.

106
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,660
But he just made them all.

107
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,480
He just changed genders off of everyone.

108
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,560
He's like, oh, this wasn't quite original.

109
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,220
Anyway, so he was like, I don't want to get caught.

110
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,860
So he put the entire world of Fiona and cake into the Ice
King's mind.

111
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:29,740
so um so that's how that's how like fiona kink's world was
born anyway so um after the ice king stopped being crazy and

112
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:36,220
became like simon again so the ice king was actually a
regular human being but he then he wore a crown and turned

113
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:44,140
fucking crazy because it's the crazy crown um you're not
like uh the normal person will not be able to like uh will

114
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:51,600
not be able to like stay sane crown because it makes you go
crazy because it's filled with magical powers and everything

115
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,020
so this regular human being named simon who was an
archaeologist professor he he wore the crown and he got

116
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:08,560
crazy but he got ice he got like ice powers anyway so
finally at the end of adventure time he became normal again

117
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:19,960
um because he took the crown off finally uh he he finally
took the crown up and then um his like girlfriend uh took

118
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,140
the crown and then she became a fucking god that that
doesn't really matter in the story at the moment so i know

119
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:32,940
you're like what the fuck she became a god so okay so here's
another like off off track here like a little sidetrack here

120
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:40,680
but his girlfriend um tried to save his life but she had to
become a god to save his life and then she like took the

121
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,980
crown away and then he became normal and then she became a
god and then she was like Bye, and then she disappeared.

122
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,740
So, anyway, he's depressed because he lost his girlfriend.

123
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,720
Anyway, but that doesn't really matter.

124
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:04,220
Like, you know, like, everything he knows about the world is
technically dead.

125
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,360
So does it really matter if it's another person?

126
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,200
Does it really matter?

127
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,680
Like, everyone he knows in love is already dead anyway.

128
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,920
So, like, what's more for one more person?

129
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:35,380
Um, so, um, um, anyway, um, anyway, so, uh, so he becomes
normal, but because Fiona and Cake was in his mind, she was

130
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:41,420
everything, yeah, but, but to her, she was, he wasn't,
though, like, he, she, he was just an experience, that's the

131
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:48,220
worst, I mean, I cried when he said that, okay, so there
was, like, this really touching moment, where to Simon she

132
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:55,400
was like everything to him and to her she was like yeah you
were just an experience but like it's like it hits hard like

133
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,520
it you know what like I say it sounds like bro you're such a
like you would think Betty you're a bitch but like but like

134
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:11,380
she did she sacrificed everything for Simon but Simon like
didn't put her at first priority priority at all like she

135
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:19,400
was like oh I could she was like oh I could like I have this
really cool scholarship opportunity where I could actually

136
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:28,340
like follow my dreams and do the things I want to do and
then Simon was like yeah but what about my studies you could

137
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:37,000
stay here instead you know and then obviously you know Betty
was like oh you know what Simon I love you I'm gonna I'm

138
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,760
gonna stay with yeah she gave

139
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:49,760
and then she was like you know what you're right simon let
me just ditch my dreams i will not follow my dreams and

140
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:59,280
follow you instead it was so sad like um anyway so yeah so
like after like you know he like met betty again like you

141
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,480
know she's like the god of chaos and um he was like he had
to finally let her go because she's like bro we can't keep

142
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,220
doing this bro i'm literally the god of chaos now like we
can't be together anymore you gotta move on you know like

143
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:18,860
she wants him to move on but simon's like but betty i can
save you and then later on like he finally moves on he's

144
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:25,880
like you were my everything and then betty was like you were
an experience and then bye bye like it's so actually cried

145
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:35,520
though i was like oh my god simon she gave you everything
and then you took it for granted and when you finally

146
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:52,160
realized how much she gave you she moves on how you fuck you
fumbled it bro you fucking fumbled it like and uh it was a

147
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,440
wonderful experience she still said experience like

148
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:06,780
okay anyway sorry i got off track here that wasn't uh part
of the that wasn't part of the recap but i actually cried

149
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:16,460
when that i actually cried watching that part because it was
it was so because like it was so fucked up um anyway so um

150
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,960
fuck where was that at the recap okay so okay simon is
normal now he is a normal human being and he's not fucking

151
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:32,000
crazy anymore um but because he is not crazy anymore um the
fiona cake world in his head is now like regular world so

152
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,740
it's not like magical or anything it's no they no longer
like cake is a regular cat instead of like a magical

153
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:47,860
stretchy cat and everything and uh you know they're in they
live in a fucking boring human world so um so it changed

154
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:57,660
it's no longer magical because simon's no longer fucking
crazy like the ice king so it's just a normal world um So,

155
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:08,580
so, so we followed that and then like, and then, and then
like, um, in this crazy quest on, I don't remember.

156
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:20,200
So basically like, they somehow took the word out of Simon's
head and then like Fiona and Kate became like real people.

157
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,560
Like it's, it's fucking trippy.

158
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,480
I know like you're like, what the fuck is she talking about?

159
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:35,100
but they took the world because Prismo planted a world
inside Simon's head and then he took the world out of his

160
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:51,640
head and now it's a real universe now um it's it's a real
universe and so so fion and cake are real people and and

161
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:58,180
marshal lee who is the gender-bent version of marshaling the
vampire queen he's voiced by Donald Glover.

162
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,780
If you guys don't know who Donald Glover is, he's Childish
Gambino.

163
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,720
If you don't know who Childish Gambino is, he's Troy from
Community.

164
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:15,980
If you don't know Troy from Community, he's the guy who's
like, where wolf by mitzvah, bump, spooky, scary, men

165
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,780
becoming woes, woes be okay, so he sang that too.

166
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,580
He also is in Atlanta, the show.

167
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,200
All right, anyway, and he did, Anyway, so, um...

168
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,540
So, anyway, so, so, it's all like the...

169
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:41,840
And also Neil Patrick Harris was Prince Gumball, but they
recasted him, and then they...

170
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,320
Okay, so this is what appeased me, I'm sorry, I'm only like
bouncing everywhere, but I'm watching this, I'm watching

171
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,900
Fiona and Kate right now, and I don't know if I like it or
not, because, like, season one was good.

172
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,180
Season one, it was good.

173
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,420
Season two is, like, all over the place.

174
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,580
I'm not really sure if I...

175
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:06,500
still don't know if I like it or not but I did I'm so upset
because they've recasted Prince Gumball three fucking times

176
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:14,100
and I'm like oh my god like I get it like the first two
actors they casted were like super big actors because like

177
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,400
the first one was like was Neil Patrick Harris and then the
second one is the guy from Pitch Perfect I don't know how

178
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,680
else to explain him he's that guy in Pitch perfect like you
remember his voice is everywhere.

179
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,060
He's all okay.

180
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,920
He's that guy.

181
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,500
He's the gay.

182
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,320
Okay He's the gay guy in the big mouth He's the gay kid in
big mouth.

183
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:51,000
You understand if you know his voice you understand who his
voice is Um Anyway, um, um, so so so and then they recasted

184
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
him again In Season 3, I don't even know who the fuck is
this guy in Season 3 Like it's not like it's not like you

185
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,280
know usually when they recast someone they try to make sure
They try to make sure like they sound the same But every

186
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:16,480
time they recast him it's literally a different voice And it
pisses me off because it's like I don't know I just I went

187
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:24,980
it just doesn't it just puts me out of immersion You know
I'm just like why like like It, I hate it I don't like how

188
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,820
they, there's no, it's no, not consistent at all.

189
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,460
Like, they don't even try to match the voice.

190
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,540
It's just, they just, it's like, it's like they just find a
gay actor.

191
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,040
It throws me up.

192
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,980
I think it's like, it's like, don't worry, at least the
actor's gay.

193
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,020
And I'm like, that's not the point.

194
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,440
That's not the fucking point.

195
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,340
At least make them sound the same.

196
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,700
Like I don't care if the voice actor is gay or not.

197
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,120
Because he's playing a gay character.

198
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,580
I was like I don't care.

199
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,380
I just want them to sound the same.

200
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:08,800
Like so that is.

201
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,800
So I just I just don't care.

202
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,460
Like.

203
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:27,300
so um so anyway um so but it's just they all sound different
like i did not that hard to like try and keep it consistent

204
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:35,880
if you're gonna like recast them three times at least make
two of them sound similar but they don't they don't make

205
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:43,640
them sound similar at all and it pisses me off That's like,
also they recasted, uh, Marshall Lee as well.

206
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,620
Um, but at least the thing is, it's not noticeable at all.

207
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,520
Um, Donald, they got, I don't know if you guys noticed, but
Donald Glover had a heart attack last, last year.

208
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,940
Um, because like, he's like super fucking stressed out and
everything.

209
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,800
Um, so like, um, so like he had a heart attack last year,
apparently.

210
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,140
And that's why he like, he had to, like, he had to back out
in like a lot of projects and stuff.

211
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,420
Yeah, during, like, his tour.

212
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,560
That's why he had, like, had to cancel his tour that he had
to do.

213
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,340
I think, like, yeah, he's, like, a huge workaholic.

214
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,480
And so he had, like, yeah, he recently had a stroke.

215
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,580
So that's why, like, it's understandable.

216
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,300
It was a stroke.

217
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,080
Sorry, a stroke.

218
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,410
Not a heart.

219
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,330
It was a stroke, but it's quite similar.

220
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,530
Isn't a stroke and a heart attack sort of similar?

221
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,030
Like, it's related to heart.

222
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,630
It's related to heart issues.

223
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:47,730
um oh are they different things oh sorry sorry i meant a
stroke um and um sorry i don't know the difference between a

224
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:54,370
heart attack and a stroke i always thought they were the
same uh i always thought oh that's in the brain okay that's

225
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:00,770
a lot worse okay that that is a lot worse i thought a stroke
is for the heart uh because it sounds like it's in the heart

226
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:08,610
you know uh but yeah no apparently it's a lot worse than a
heart now i know it's a lot worse than a heart attack um

227
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:14,850
Anyway, so that's why he has to back out of a lot of
projects and they had to like recast him for Adventure time

228
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:20,730
because he had to pick and choose like what he can and can't
do Because, you know, like he had to rest and everything.

229
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:28,430
He can't do a lot of work stuff anymore Um, and uh, yeah,
and yeah, both are really bad regardless.

230
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:35,410
But anyway, so he Uh, he had to, you know, he couldn't do it
Marshal Lee anymore.

231
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:42,130
But the thing is they're Lee, but he literally sounds, he is
so good.

232
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:49,270
The new guy he got, the new guy, the new guy they got for
Marshall Lee sounds exactly like Donald Glover.

233
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:58,850
And the only reason I knew that they recasted Donald Glover
is because it, it like showed up on my for you Twitter page,

234
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:07,790
because they were like, wait, Donald Glover wasn't credited,
um, during like the, um, in the, IMDB credits like wait does

235
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:15,130
that mean he's not gonna be an adventure time like for this
next new season so that's the only reason why I knew I knew

236
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:25,010
that he got recasted because if I listen to it it literally
sounds like him and I didn't even know but Prince Gumball

237
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:35,470
every voice is different and it pisses me off because it's
not consistent I it's like it might as well be a fucking new

238
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:42,930
character that's the worst part it's so different from each
other it might as well be a nude character like it's not

239
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:54,890
even gumball like it's i i don't think i don't know i it's
just it appeased me so much because i just wish i like you

240
00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:02,050
know every time someone gets recasted they usually try to
like match the voice as closely as possible but never

241
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:08,050
gumball i don't understand like who the fuck are you Anyway,
sorry, I got off track here.

242
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,030
so, Beacon and Cake end up being like its own little
character.

243
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:24,070
It's like they're their own characters, their own
personalities, their own like their own history and story.

244
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,890
Okay, the weirdest, okay, I need to talk about this plot
boy.

245
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:34,970
So, for those who know Adventure Time or don't know
Adventure Time, there's Jake, Jake the Dog, and his wife,

246
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,930
Princess Rainicorn.

247
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,010
I assume that's what...

248
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:39,590
Rainicorn.

249
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,470
Right?

250
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,350
Yeah, Lady...

251
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,330
Sorry, Lady Rainicorn.

252
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,310
She's technically a princess, I feel like.

253
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,210
Sorry, Lady Rainicorn.

254
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,950
So, it's like husband and wife.

255
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:54,470
And Lady Rainicorn is literally a rainbow unicorn that
flies.

256
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,950
Anyway, so...

257
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,850
In the...

258
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,190
Yeah, the Korean...

259
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,010
The Korean rainbow unicorn.

260
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,590
Anyway, so...

261
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,630
In the gender-bent version...

262
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:12,590
um so cake ends up being a magical cat again um i don't know
it's fucking weird because prismo was like bam you're a

263
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:20,110
magical cat and then she kept all her powers in the in the
in the normal world um and like people don't find that

264
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:31,310
fucking weird that's a magical stretching talking cat anyway
so so so the gender bent version of lady rainicorn is lord

265
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:37,310
monochrome i think i think that's called I think that's his
name.

266
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,850
Is that, is that his name?

267
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,710
Yeah, Lord Monochromicorn.

268
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,070
Oh my god, never mind.

269
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,710
That's even fucking more worse.

270
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:58,130
Okay, so his name is Lord Monochromicorn and it's the gender
bent version of Lady Rainicorn, but that's just a fucking

271
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,510
man.

272
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:14,750
So they don't make him like, make him like an actual like
you know horse or anything it's literally a man and then

273
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:24,870
like cake is like flirting with him and everything and
they're sort of like dating and i'm like bro

274
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:42,240
i'm like i'm like i'm honestly a little uncomfortable with
that storyline like I guess because it's like that's a cat

275
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:54,140
and you're a man but but they're trying to make it like a
romantic like love story and I'm like he's a man

276
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:10,940
yeah so I'll see if I can get I'll get like a screencast and
then like cake a fucking cat by the way has like a dream

277
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:18,400
where she's pregnant and like you know lord monochrome
mccoran is there like as a man just being like oh i'm here

278
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:36,420
to support you and then she gives birth to fucking cats and
i'm like this is no no i'm like no i do not like this okay

279
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,940
okay here Here you go.

280
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,400
This is so fucking weird.

281
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,560
I don't know.

282
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,000
That also weirds me out.

283
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,520
That's why, like, I don't know how I feel about Fiona and
Jake.

284
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,520
I really don't know.

285
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,020
Season 2 is goddamn weird.

286
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,280
It's so fucking weird.

287
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,080
I literally just watched the newest episode.

288
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,120
Like, like, I... Like, it's like, oh.

289
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,620
It's like, what is this?

290
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:08,620

328
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,250
Anyway, so...

329
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,510
That's my...

330
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,550
That's, like, one of my gripes about Fiona and Cake.

331
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,390
That's, like...

332
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:09,790
I have a lot of issues with the newest season, but, like,
this is one of my issues here.

333
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,270
Just because, like, why did...

334
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,070
I don't know.

335
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,490
I just don't know.

336
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,690
I just don't fuck with that.

337
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,350
I just don't fuck with that.

338
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,250
It's just weird.

339
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,930
It was actually just weird.

340
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,430
Anyway.

341
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:39,970
Anyway.

342
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:52,750
so like that's like one of my issues um i need you to
explain to me how it's better if he's a unicorn and said

343
00:36:52,750 --> 00:37:00,910
nexi thank you for the super chat thank you thank you
because at least it's like an animal and like at least it's

344
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:14,710
an animal and like i don't know it's further away from I'll
say it's further away from bestiality It doesn't make it

345
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:21,550
Obviously it doesn't make it better But at least it's not
bestiality Like

346
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:40,810
That's what I mean At least it's not that There's still like
other reasons wrong But at least it's not that like true and

347
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:55,670
real so um yeah and also she was originally a fucking cat
like like it's only because prisma was like zap you're not a

348
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:05,830
fucking regular cat that like that that happened like one
season ago it was just a cat like a real fucking cat she

349
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:10,490
literally has been sentient for like maybe like two months

350
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:28,110
that's also a problem she had sentience for two months guys
um um oh my god what else what else was what else did i have

351
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,210
grapes about oh yeah but anyway yeah Fiona is just
incredibly unlikable.

352
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:41,430
Like the new, the new episode with her, she is just, like,
she's just so unlikable.

353
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:47,050
You, like, I get, like, the writers want to be like, yeah,
but she's very flawed as a character, just to be more

354
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,590
relatable.

355
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,790
And I'm like, I don't even want her as a friend.

356
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,110
She's a bad friend.

357
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,750
She's a very, very bad friend.

358
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:59,850
Like, um, Savior.

359
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:06,590
Thank you for the magenta soup, but they can thank you Babe,
I'm breaking up with you.

360
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,370
It's not you.

361
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,150
You were poggers.

362
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:08,550
It's me.

363
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,070
I'm Omega I'm sorry.

364
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,930
This is Pepe.

365
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:21,210
Oh my god You know, like I won't be surprised I won't be
surprised if

366
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,910
And if like Oh my god, what are the new gen?

367
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,090
It's gen alpha, right?

368
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:34,770
I won't be surprised if that's something Gen Alpha kids
would say, unironically.

369
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,150
A relationship has been weird chat for months.

370
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,430
It's time to end it, no kappa.

371
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,750
Thank you, magenta, super.

372
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,870
Thank you, thank you.

373
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,050
Because it's like, okay, you guys, okay, look.

374
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,190
I know I'm going to make you guys cringe.

375
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,410
But you know, like, the 6-7 joke?

376
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,450
So it's, you guys, for those who don't know, it started like
a year.

377
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,810
I think the 6-7 joke started, like, a year ago.

378
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:05,890
But, like, for Gen Alpha and, like, Zoomers, they actually
thought it was funny like not unironically it's like it they

379
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:13,870
all thought it was actually funny funny um because like they
you know but now now everyone like everyone in all the

380
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:19,990
generations know what six seven is and now everyone just
says it because people think it's like i'm not like it's

381
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:27,130
ironic humor now yeah um yeah now it's everywhere because
now everyone was like

382
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:35,730
It's so cringe to the fact that people find it funny now
because it's ironic humor now.

383
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:45,110
So it's like how people thought like 69 was cringe and now
everyone says ha ha 69 because it's like ironic humor.

384
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,130
It now went full circle.

385
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,150
It made it into my Christmas card theme.

386
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,330
I still don't know what 6-7 is.

387
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,610
6-7 is basically what's from some rapper.

388
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:07,130
lyric and then some kid was like made a meme about it like
like in his generation like gen alpha and everything yeah

389
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:16,710
see everyone's everyone's now like nice like we're all like
nice but you're 69 but when it first became a thing when 69

390
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:23,130
first became a thing everyone would be like oh man you're so
cringe bro but now it went full circle and now it's funny

391
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:30,690
because it's like ironically funny And now 67 is doing that
thing now too Because people say 67 as a way to be like

392
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:38,810
ironically funny But it's so cringe because we're not at
that It took 69 a couple of years to make it there So just

393
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:47,470
give 67 a bit of time And then we'll all be like Ha ha 67 I
know you guys all think it's cringe right now But give it a

394
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:53,110
couple of more months for it to cook And then you're gonna
start seeing it unironically Or ironically You're gonna

395
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,210
start seeing it ironically Just give it a couple of months
for it to cook.

396
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,710
Just like Skippity Toilet.

397
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:58,930
We're all like, oh, cringe.

398
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,870
But then people are like, ha ha, look, I got Skippity
Toilet.

399
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,530
You're like, oh, yeah, ha ha.

400
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:07,270
You said it was, I know somebody like, I still think it's
cringe now.

401
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,270
But people do use it as an ironic, funny thing.

402
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,140
It always goes full circle.

403
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,340
At one point, it goes so cringe that it becomes ironically
funny.

404
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:37,800
you find skibbity funny i don't i've never even watched the
videos of where skibbity toilet comes from i find it funny

405
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,780
now because i find it ironically funny to the because i
bought skibbity toilet as a fortnite cosmetic so every time

406
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,420
i bring it out i think it's fucking hilarious because i'd be
like guys look i have skibbity toilet it's my backpack guys

407
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,200
and it's just a great it's like a great like

408
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,560
Because it's great.

409
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,420
Whenever I bring up Fortnite, I'd be like, look, guys, I got
Skibity Toilet as my backpack.

410
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,340
And it's a good icebreaker.

411
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,540
Because it's fucking so stupid that it's funny.

412
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,060
Apparently, as Lord and the Creator is improving their
animation.

413
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh, someone doesn't know the newest update.

414
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,180
The Creator lost all rights to Skibity Toilet.

415
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,540
Michael Bay owns it now.

416
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,820
I still don't know understand how the fuck Michael Bay is
going to make that a movie but we'll see in like two to

417
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:48,200
three years I guess yeah how oh for those who don't know um
basically like uh the creator signed the I guess he like was

418
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,720
so greedy I guess he didn't have someone fucking looking at
the contracts or something he didn't get real lawyer to look

419
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:01,000
through the contracts because Hollywood contracts are very
predatory no Michael Bay is a fucking terrible person for

420
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
those who don't know the actual lore behind Michael Bay he
makes great like dumb movies but like he's an actual

421
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,960
terrible person um she okay you guys might be like oh but he
discovered like Megan Fox and whatever no apparently he was

422
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:26,380
like a huge creep towards like Megan Fox during like the
filming of Transformers and like he was actually he's like

423
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:39,060
actually like incredibly creepy and like allegedly a really
bad person yeah um and then apparently try to ruin megan

424
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:50,120
fox's career right after like uh right after that um but
like uh but like anyway so um i'm not surprised because it's

425
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:56,620
hollywood and a lot of hollywood contracts are incredibly
like predatory um because it's all up there you know what

426
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:02,980
Hollywood wants is to just make as much money as possible
and pay the least amount of money possible to other people

427
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:12,000
um because that's Hollywood baby um and that's why like um a
lot of actors and actresses tend to not make money from the

428
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,480
film uh like current for those who don't know current movie
contracts for those who don't have good lawyers like for

429
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:28,200
like actors and actresses who don't have like good lawyers
or like good agents a lot of them don't make money if their

430
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:40,500
movie succeeds in the box office um because hollywood would
uh push for contracts that would either be like just payment

431
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:49,720
uh for like just like you know like a flat fee or or they
would do a payment style where um they pay based off how

432
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:55,060
well based off how well a movie does in box office and
streaming.

433
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,080
But then they will purposely be like, oh, the movie did
really terrible.

434
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,400
So, like, I guess we don't have to pay you anything.

435
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,260
But then, like, obviously the movie would seem like a box
office success.

436
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,600
But then they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

437
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,600
Look, look, see, look at the finances.

438
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,540
Look, guys.

439
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,820
Look, see, it says we made negative money.

440
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,460
Because, like, because, like, we spent it all.

441
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:29,340
during production and advertising and we didn't make enough
in the in the theaters in the box office but in the end um

442
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:36,940
in the end a lot of these movie companies they would open a
shell company and then like pay like they'll be like they'll

443
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:43,140
open like a shell company that would be like oh provides uh
camera equipment to the production team like it's like their

444
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:51,600
own shell company like it's their own producer shell company
where they'll be like oh yeah see we paid this by them like

445
00:46:51,600 --> 00:47:01,480
500 000 for like the production of everything so like all
that money went over there so oh i'm sorry so like if we

446
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:08,840
look at all the finances and subtract everything like we
technically barely broke even so because of that we can't

447
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:15,500
pay you um this we can't pay you the amount because
technically the movie didn't do well enough to um to even

448
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:23,400
make a profit yeah no it's really fucked up there's like a
really good video that um that talks about it how's that

449
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:35,620
even legal um um that's very easy to explain um Hollywood is
filled with incredibly rich people and in order for those

450
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:45,540
incredibly rich people to keep being incredibly rich they
have really good lawyers to make

451
00:47:51,980 --> 00:48:01,720
tiny toes welcome to the tomato farm welcome welcome um yeah
it's just lots of loopholes uh bird thank you for the super

452
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:07,240
chat thank you thank you uh just i want to say you're
amazing thank you super chat thank you thank you i really

453
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:14,760
appreciate it we guys have been enjoying the stream so far
yeah like they have yeah the best lawyers so um so that's

454
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:25,100
why i I'm not surprised that that the Skibity toilet creator
literally by the way his the YouTube channel isn't even

455
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:33,640
owned by him now it's owned by Michael Bay so Michael Bay
owns this man's channel because he signed he literally

456
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:45,800
signed away all his rights to Michael Bay so Michael Bay
owns everything now and he has not been paid like Since he

457
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:52,340
signed the contract with them so like all those
merchandising deals like the movie the merchandising deals

458
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,860
the fucking fortnight cop Yes, I funded Michael Bay to be
fair.

459
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:06,280
I bought the fucking cosmetic before he before he revealed
That he lost his all his rights to Michael Bay.

460
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,080
Okay guys.

461
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:16,920
I did not know I was funding Michael Bay I legitimately did
not know because nobody knew until like last month and I

462
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:31,540
bought that cosmetic at least five months ago I just just a
disclaimer if I knew Michael Bay now owns Skippity Toilet I

463
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:47,380
would not have bought I would not have bought the cosmetic
um shake my head Toki and do better Yeah, so, no, you got a

464
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:56,040
lot of, you got a lot of money out of fucking Zoomers who
took their parents' credit cards for sure.

465
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,080
You would, you would.

466
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,100
No, I would not.

467
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,260
I would not.

468
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,700
It's also why I have not played Poppy's Playtime.

469
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:12,220
Because I felt really weird playing it because of all the
drama surrounding Poppy's Playtime.

470
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,860
I don't know if it's, like, when it first came up.

471
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,160
Like, I do have some integrity.

472
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,740
Nango, thank you for the super chat.

473
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,840
Thank you, thank you.

474
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,700
First, Shupa, just to say this is an epic anti-Bay Hollywood
rant.

475
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,700
What drama?

476
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,900
I don't know if it's, like, if it's, like, okay now.

477
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,340
Like, I haven't seen, like, the current, I didn't read the
current update.

478
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:47,200
But, like, for those who don't know, the original creators
of Poppy Playtime, They used to come from, like, they used

479
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,540
to make FNAF parodies.

480
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,940
Or not just FNAF parody.

481
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,500
They used to do, like, like, Kid Slop, I think.

482
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,600
I think that's, what's the word for them?

483
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:01,240
Oh, what's the, what's the word for it?

484
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,860
It's like, is it Kid Slop?

485
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,920
Is that the proper term for it?

486
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,140
Where it's, like, brain rot videos?

487
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:12,340
No, it's like, they're like, like, those brain rot YouTube
videos.

488
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,300
Like, content farm.

489
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,860
Yeah, so...

490
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:22,300
They used to be, like, semi-content farm accounts originally
before they made Poppy Playtime.

491
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,140
And it would be, like, content farm of, like, you know,
Minecraft,

492
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,260
FNAF, I don't remember.

493
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,180
I just remember Minecraft and FNAF.

494
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,320
They used to do that.

495
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,780
And apparently, they used to be like...

496
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,580
They used to be like...

497
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,860
They used to have, like, a channel where they make fun of...

498
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,780
other 3D animators back then.

499
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,260
Like, I think like half of the creators.

500
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,320
I don't know if it's like all the creators.

501
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,160
But I think like some of the creators of Poppy Playtime.

502
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,580
They used to have a channel where they literally do like
CinemaSins.

503
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,520
But instead of CinemaSins on like movies.

504
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,180
They did it on like other indie animators.

505
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,020
So they were like assholes.

506
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,260
Yeah, they were like fucking assholes.

507
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,300
But people were like, oh, they were really young back then.

508
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,720
or something.

509
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,400
I don't remember.

510
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:16,700
Yeah.

511
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,680
So it was like a couple of years ago.

512
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,100
Yeah, no.

513
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,460
So they were like actual like assholes.

514
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:21,880
Yeah.

515
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:27,540
And they were like bullying like underage animators.

516
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:37,140
They were bullying like underage kids who were trying to,
who were like aspiring animators with it and stuff.

517
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,380
Yeah.

518
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,020
So it was like, they were just punching down and stuff.

519
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:48,160
And so that's why like when, because I knew about that, and
then they made poppy's playtime and that's why i have never

520
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:55,800
played poppy's playtime because i just didn't i didn't like
i didn't like that um there i didn't like that they they

521
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:04,000
like used to do that back then and um they got called out
for it a while like a long time ago when chapter one first

522
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,480
came out uh when chapter one first came out they got like
called out for it and stuff and like you know people

523
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:17,320
uncovered a lot about him being like yeah no that's really
fucked up because that they did private a bunch of those

524
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,940
videos when it happened because you know they're like oh
like after a while they apologized um they apologized and

525
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,760
were like yeah like we regret everything we did back then
and stuff like that because they actually like they kept

526
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,360
doing it to like one animator and then he got like he got
like super like depressed and everything and like like it

527
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:41,060
was actually like cyberbullying and stuff like that and um
it was only when they got called out that they private a

528
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:49,260
bunch of those like videos when they because like it's the
thing Um, that made me like not really Um, no, they'd stop

529
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,660
doing it Obviously because they have Poppy's playtime now
Like they don't have to do that shit anymore Like they have

530
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:02,400
their fucking Um, their content farm now They have their Um,
their golden ticket It's literally, they have their golden

531
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,160
ticket now They don't have to do that anymore Um, because
they can just merchandise Poppy playtime For the rest of

532
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:14,800
their lives Until like, you know, for like Possibly at least
20 years Because of finale Yeah, they're their own big IP

533
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:24,300
now so um so they don't they don't have to like worry about
doing that anymore um but obviously um in chapter one um

534
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:29,580
after chapter one release you know everybody was like oh my
god it's so like what are you it's still like i would say

535
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:35,000
like it's not really a unique concept because it's still
like a mascot like you know it's still like the typical

536
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,700
horror genre where you get a mascot character but what if
they're evil so um i won't say it's quite a unique concept

537
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:48,420
but it is like Like, you know, like it checks all the boxes
of what children want.

538
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,100
Of what, like what makes a good IP that kids would love.

539
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,880
And wow, you can merchandise it and shit.

540
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,800
Yeah, the mascot horror market.

541
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,760
Because it's like, it's great for merchandising.

542
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,220
It's like a great cash cow.

543
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,800
But that's why I've never touched Poppy's playtime.

544
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,300
Because I've always felt super uncomfortable about like the
creators and stuff.

545
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:23,460
um maybe i mean they did apologize but it was only like
afterwards where like they had a lot of controversies with

546
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:36,820
like you know the they also like at that time too um at that
time too um they had that nft drama as well so that's why

547
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:44,860
i'm like oh you know i was just like oh i don't really want
to touch it because like you know they got called out for

548
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:54,020
the the whole like bullying like like underage indie
animators and also um the whole nft thing so that's why like

549
00:55:54,020 --> 00:56:01,520
for me i've never like touched poppy's playtime because of
it i do enjoy it i like the concept itself is like i know

550
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:10,260
like i was just like oh it's just not really that um um i've
always loved like reanimated uh reanimated plushies like

551
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:17,260
that's like one of my favorite what's the word one of my
favorite tropes in general, even though I know it's like,

552
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:28,000
oh, it's just like a cash grab merchandising cash cow thing
for, um, for people, but I've always loved the reanimated,

553
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,760
uh, toys trope because it's, it's such a cute idea.

554
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,260
Um, I mean, it's horror, but like, it's such a cute and
interesting idea.

555
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,320
And I always love seeing designs of that and everything.

556
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:49,640
Um, so that really sucks, you know, I have always wanted to,
you know, play time but i just don't with the creators and

557
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:57,300
that's why i've never played the game i don't think i will
um just because of that um it's also similar to some people

558
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:05,400
would be like what about doom like oh doki how come you've
never played doom on stream or like because it's such a

559
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:18,660
classic game and um it's such a classic game and it's like
um it's like you know um something that everyone like um

560
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:27,140
everyone talks about when they talk about like you know fps
genres and stuff so at that time when i wanted to play doom

561
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:35,420
it was when there was the music drama going on yeah so
apparently yeah so that's also why i've never touched doom

562
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:43,820
as well and i was just waiting to see if that ever got
resolved until like then for me to try doom but it's also

563
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:53,060
because they They screwed over the music producer, the
original music producer for Doom, who's created all the

564
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,480
original soundtrack for the most memorable Doom songs.

565
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,420
And when I wanted to play Doom, that news broke out.

566
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,320
So I was like, oh, okay, that timing really sucked.

567
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,520
Because I actually really wanted to play Doom.

568
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:20,320
And then there was like, and then the whole controversy,
broke out with the the original music producer of doom so i

569
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:28,100
never got a chance to try it out because of it yeah it was
incredibly bad timing that felt really bad for uh for mick

570
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:37,560
because you know he was um he was like you know the
originator of like some of the most memorable doomed music

571
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:48,460
out there uh yeah so that's why i didn't wasn't ever able to
try out i think it was doom eternal I don't mind Maybe I

572
00:58:48,460 --> 00:59:02,800
don't mind Trying out like Doom Like Doom games that didn't
screw over Mick Gordon Yeah So I don't know I need to

573
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:08,220
research that I need to research like which Doom games
Didn't screw over Mr. Gordon

574
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:21,000
So I have to like research that the classic doom games yeah
so doom one to three which sucks i always wanted to try the

575
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:28,240
modern ones too because the modern ones look really good as
well but i don't know it's i i just have like i guess i have

576
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:38,120
like this integrity i guess like um i just feel really off
about supporting like you know supporting companies that do

577
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:46,200
stuff like that and that's why you see me not touch some
certain game series um if i feel like i just don't want to i

578
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:56,580
just don't want to support like i just don't want to support
a brand that's like that okay so so basically i'm not like

579
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,580
michael bay

580
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:10,350
so in conclusion that makes me very different from michael
bay

581
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:25,390
um let's see x factor thank you for the super chat thank you
thank you uh speaking finnaf i watched finnaf too and i

582
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:31,510

you were listening to the credits and not the fans thank you

583
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:38,850
for the super chat thank you thank you yeah i know i know
like finnaf one has always got like um i remember finnaf one

584
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:45,070
got really shitty reviews um when first came up because the
creator is so unsanit because like finnaf was mostly made

585
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:55,890
for was made for fans also i'm sorry for those who didn't
watch them oh the audios went a bit weird no it's because i

586
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:05,750
was talking through this so hey guys this is my new water
bottle and it has literally two two liters of water so i was

587
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,990
literally drinking water when i was talking

588
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:19,830
I don't want to lie to you guys so for those who do not for
those who don't watch member streams I'm not gonna lie to

589
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:28,090
people who aren't members who did not are also or who are
members and did not watch my FNAF watch along stream but I

590
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:33,090
did not enjoy FNAF 1 as much as people think I did

591
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,330
it's just I'm I'm sorry

592
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:47,470
You're right.

593
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,310
It's because she loved it.

594
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:49,950
Okay.

595
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:50,910
Okay.

596
01:01:51,490 --> 01:02:03,290
So, look, to watch, the thing is, I think if I watched it by
myself, I would have, I would definitely not be as happy.

597
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:16,070
But I think for Nap is the type of movie that you have to
watch with your friends or you won't have or okay it's

598
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:30,690
either you have to watch with your friends or or you have uh
or as someone who is very very very into finaf to be able to

599
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:42,190
enjoy it because like there were so many parts and moments
in finaf one where i was just like what the There are so

600
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,310
many plows.

601
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:49,410
I know, you guys, you're like, Toki, you're supposed to
watch this movie with, like, with your brain turn off, God.

602
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,530
Like, bro, you're supposed to watch it with your brain turn
off.

603
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,990
You're not supposed to think too hard.

604
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:56,190
But, you, bro, okay, you cannot justify.

605
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,930
There is one scene you cannot fucking defend.

606
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:07,330
And it's that scene where the kid was like, I know what to
do to save, save everyone.

607
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:18,550
And she fucking just drew a picture the wall and then and
then bam the the animatronics are freed now and i was like

608
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:36,660
what the just like you cannot defend that scene like what
the fuck was that there was no like build up or lead to it

609
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:45,940
there was no hints on like that was the solution yeah one
drawing just changes everything and that was like that was

610
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:55,260
the scene where i was like there's no way anyone can defend
that scene because it because it's like i like there was no

611
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:00,840
build-up there's no it was there's no mystery to stop like
you there's it's like you know you keep oh maybe like

612
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:10,920
there's hints about it there's foreshadowing that this was
what you have to do to like um free the animatronics from um

613
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:22,620
foreshadowing that led to this also what the fuck happened
to her aunt okay also that part too what the fuck happened

614
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:37,960
to her dead aunt like they just left her body in their in
their house and then like what happened to her like is she

615
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:51,920
still alive or is she dead like she's just gone and then
we're supposed to believe that there's the happy ending like

616
01:04:51,920 --> 01:05:04,720
i is she just dead i guess like oh okay i'll find out that
too okay okay we'll find out at part two okay apparently

617
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:12,380
part two explains what happened okay but can you answer i
don't care i don't care if you spoil me x factor is she

618
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:20,220
alive or dead like that's all want to know because that was
the that was also another plot point for me the plot hole

619
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:30,240
for me where i was like what the fuck happened to the aunt
like i need to know is she dead or oh she's dead okay so why

620
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:38,840
the fuck were they so happy the day after like what did they
like drag the did they just like put the aunt's dead body in

621
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,080
the corner and be like it's time for school

622
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:53,680
because it's really like the next day and they're like yeah
she's hanging out and talking to people now after knowing

623
01:05:53,680 --> 01:06:07,920
that her fucking aunt was dead like okay anyway yeah they
hated yeah they hated her but it's still a dead person dead

624
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,440
like oh my god wouldn't that give trauma

625
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:22,170
You might hate someone, but it's still a fucking dead human
body that died in your home.

626
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:30,890
I'd be pretty traumatized if like some fucks anybody, I
don't care if I hate them or not, but if somebody died in my

627
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:43,690
home and I was living there and I was still there living in
that house and there was a dead fucking body like in the

628
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:45,130
room next door.

629
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:47,430
I'd have trauma.

630
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:48,610
I don't care.

631
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:55,430
Stop thinking.

632
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,410
Stop using logic.

633
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:02,210
Okay.

634
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:07,590
So, so yeah, no, that's like one of my issues about that.

635
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:15,790
That was like, there was some issues I had with the movie,
but the dead aunt and the fucking pinning a drawing on the

636
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:28,590
wall, to fix everything magic was like two of my gripes but
anyway anyway but but yeah so so I am looking forward to

637
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:39,150
seeing how FNAF 2 goes with like follows up with the
original FNAF and I heard they're making FNAF 3 as well so

638
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:45,910
it'll be pretty interesting because apparently FNAF 2 teases
FNAF 3 and um

639
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:57,930
and um and you know i'm curious like is it um i'm curious to
see like um what the fan reactions are to it like the fan

640
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:02,210
reviews to it because like critics don't will never
understand because the movie is not written for them

641
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:12,890
obviously like the movie is for the fanaf fans um i'm pretty
sure the first movie like i'm not a big fanaf fan like all i

642
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:22,890
do is like oh my god you know is that the 1960 is that the
bite of 69 like that's Like I don't even know the the like

643
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,950
surface level of fanap and

644
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:36,550
So like that's really all I know about fanap is the surface
level so obviously No, it's guys, of course.

645
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:38,630
It's the bite of 55 guys.

646
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:47,510
Anyway Anyway So I know the movie is not for me It's not
written for me.

647
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:48,710
It's written for the fans.

648
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:54,910
So I'm very curious how the second movie is going to be like
too also apparently What's his name?

649
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:56,570
PETA from Hunger Games.

650
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,470
I don't know his actual Josh Hutcherson.

651
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:59,530
I remember his name.

652
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:05,490
His name just popped up in my head Josh Hutcherson He's
actually he's apparently a fortnight and overwatch gamer

653
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:14,950
Which is fucking crazy To think about That's like during the
red carpet interview.

654
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:18,390
He was like oh Oh, yeah, I was playing Fortnite before I was
got here.

655
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:20,770
He's like, I was almost late.

656
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:25,170

new chapter came on.

I wanted to check out the new map.

658
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:28,010
And then he's like, oh, my God.

659
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:31,250
I can't believe he killed off the bus driver.

660
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:37,290
Like, he was just fucking spending his time on the interview
talking about Fortnite to the fucking interviewer.

661
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:40,730
And you know, the guy was just like, what the fuck are you

Oh, but but yeah.

715
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,220
No, I, I, pooh.

716
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,060
That was a lot of ranting today.

717
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,580
A lot of ranting today.

718
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,800
It grinds my gears.

719
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:00,710
Oh my gosh, did you guys know?

720
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,770
You had to get that out of my chest.

721
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:06,950
Do you guys know that, oh god, AI is so fucking crazy now.

722
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:17,710
But like, I didn't like, okay, so because AI is so hard to
like, especially AI art and AI videos, But it's so hard to

723
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:26,350
tell if it's AI these days because obviously like computers
are like, you know, like technology is learning more and

724
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,630
more, especially AI.

725
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:30,810
So every day they're learning because that's all about AI.

726
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:32,770
They're all just it's like artificial intelligence.

727
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:35,690
So they're always learning every fucking day.

728
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,790
So they're always improving every day.

729
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:46,930
And now apparently in Japan, because like even artwork is so
hard to tell if it's AI or not now.

730
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:59,510
for art that like um like japanese game studios now uh when
they hire uh new uh when they hire new uh like this game

731
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:08,330
designers or artists to work in their company um they have
to like draw in front of them if they get picked for an

732
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:16,430
interview they have to like draw in front of them to prove
that they are an actual artist yeah yeah they actually make

733
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:22,270
them on the spot yeah i was like bro that's looking crazy i
was like that's how like that they have to do that now

734
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:29,850
because people are like you know like you know people are
like generating ai art for their portfolios or stuff or even

735
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:34,770
like using it to like you know i i like you know you could
do stuff where like you know you do a sketch and then have

736
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:41,990
ai fill it out too because ai is crazy now ai can generate
sketches and like generate like like you draw a sketch and

737
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:47,750
then like have them color over it or anything or have them
line art it and stuff like that so like you know um they

738
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:57,190
want someone that actually earned the spot to be hired not
have like ai do everything for them there's actually insane

739
01:20:57,190 --> 01:21:05,430
that they have to do that test now because they don't trust
portfolios anymore that's actually insane also speaking of

I do not want to pay the scalpers, guys.

773
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:03,630
I really, really do not want to buy a Zootopia Scrub Daddy
from Scalpers.

774
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:06,890
All right.

775
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:09,670
I did, but at least it wasn't a scalper.

776
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:12,350
It was just a really expensive funny joke.

777
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:13,470
That's different.

778
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:15,050
It was a bit

779
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:30,810
Anyway, so as I said Zootopia 2 is incredibly popular in
Asia like some movie theaters are doing like watch-alongs

780
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:36,670
Where you can bring your dog to watch Zootopia So there's

I know that's like the worst part when you're trying to

785
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:18,610
figure out if it's AI or not, but from what I know, this is
a real thing.

786
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,710
It is not AI.

787
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:21,350
Thank fucking God.

788
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:24,870
Yeah, they're showing it for dogs only.

789
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:29,150
Also, yeah, like Zootopia is incredibly popular in China as
well.

790
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:30,210
I told you guys about it.

791
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:33,650
That's why they built Zootopia in Shanghai, Disneyland.

792
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:38,050
Yeah, they're all dancing, too.

793
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:39,490
It's so cute.

794
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:41,790
Oh, it's so fucking cute.

795
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,800
Oh, my.

796
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,920
Yeah, it's just five.

797
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:58,360
But yeah, other than that, there's also like, and like,
okay, it's actually crazy.

798
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:00,920
So anyway, remember I told you guys about Pombert?

799
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:02,440
Fuck Pombert, by the way.

800
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,240
Canva.

801
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:07,080
Pombert coming in with a goddamn steel chair.

802
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:12,480
I did not think he was like, like, because like, it's
played, it's voice acted by Adam's...

803
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,740
Like, it's voice acted by Andy Sandberg.

804
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:19,160
So, I was just like, so when people were like, oh, yeah,
Poverty is so fucking hot.

805
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,320
And I'm like, bro, that's Andy Sandberg from Lonely Island.

806
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,160
Like, like, I don't know.

807
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,100
Yeah, he's a fucking industry plant, bro.

808
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,340
Like, he's a goddamn industry plant.

809
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,360
Because I'm like, bro, that's Andy Sandberg from Lonely
Island.

810
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:37,340
What the fuck do you mean, hot?

811
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,760
Like, yeah.

812
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:55,380
But for those who don't know, Popper in Japan is insanely
popular because he's apparently voiced by a very famous

813
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:59,080
Japanese actor who's very hot.

814
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:10,860
Because the only reason why I knew about this is because I
forgot this guy's, the actor's name.

815
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:25,240
Apparently, in Japan, like, majority of the, like, this guy
has, like, an entire, an entire fucking shelf dedicated to

816
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:25,520
him.

817
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,180
And I'm like, holy fuck!

818
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:36,560
Because, like, they're banking on the fact that he is
voice-acted by one of the most famous, very hot, Japanese

819
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,200
actor.

820
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,040
To voice him.

821
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:48,060
So they brought, so they like made so much merchandise of
him in Japan, just fully dedicated to poverty.

822
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:56,060
Just banking on the fact that he was, he is voiced acted by,
uh, by a hot Japanese actor who's sort of, who's like pretty

823
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:56,960
famous in Japan.

824
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:01,360
So like this entire shelf is just dedicated to poverty.

825
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:04,480
Who voices him in Japan?

826
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:04,960
Whose voices?

827
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,100
Let me grab the name.

828
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,680
I don't remember his name.

829
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:28,720
about it let me see I could find it um Yamada Ryusuke I
think that's his name yeah no I I get it yeah it's this guy

830
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:39,400
Yamada Ryusuke I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing it wrong um
but apparently he is really famous actor and he voices

831
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:50,540
Pobrid and um and that's why he has a famous actor and
musician uh yeah Rose to Promise as a teen idol in 2007 so

832
01:29:50,540 --> 01:30:00,960
he's been doing this for a while he is um oh yeah no he his

01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,160

01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:11,020
Yeah, no.

836
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:11,780
Yeah, he seems.

837
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:15,200
Oh, he was Edward in Full Metal Alchemist.

838
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:16,780
Wait, what?

839
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:23,100
Oh, he played Edward in the live action Full Metal
Alchemist.

840
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:23,820
Oh.

841
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:26,020
That's crazy.

842
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,360
Yeah, that was him.

843
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,660
Yeah, he played the live action FMA films.

844
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:35,490
Yeah, hey, I know that guy.

845
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:37,350
Is that reference?

846
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:39,850
Yeah, he's a live-action Ed.

847
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,410
There was a live-action?

848
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:48,490
Yeah, the Jap, don't worry, the Japanese live-action.

849
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:54,960
Yeah, this guy.

850
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:56,340
Oh, wait, made by Netflix.

851
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,200
I knew about it.

852
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:09,040
I knew about it because, like, you know, people love talking
about the, talking about, like, live-action adaptations.

853
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:24,470
I mean it's really hard to do a live action of full metal
alchemist to be fair to be fair Chad is like like like it's

854
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:33,590
hard to make that believable in real life especially with
like like uh doing the like the alchemy shit I feel like

855
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:38,710
that's really hard especially like with all the effects you
have to do yeah

856
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:55,710
like the only good live action adaptation you can do from an
anime is literally like slice of life because like i like

857
01:31:55,710 --> 01:32:03,650
like that's what anime that's what animation is for to do
things you can't do with like live action slash cgi disney

858
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:14,470
um seriously who the fuck is moana the irl the live action
movie for also lion king as well who the fuck is lion king

859
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:21,590
and the moana live action movie for because like apparently
the moana live action film is apparently oh my god the

860
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:34,690
chicken is so ugly like moana live action move like oh my
god the chicken in itself is so fucking ugly like what the

861
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:39,250
fuck what child they're like no it's for the adults what
kind of adult want this

862
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:46,620
Like, look at the chicken, guys.

863
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:47,560
Oh,

864
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:51,230
the chicken.

865
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:54,030
It does look like just get a real chicken.

866
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:55,150
Why does...

867
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,650
Just get a real chicken!

868
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:01,890
Bro, that's just like uncanny valley, bro.

869
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:04,510
Just get a real fucking chicken.

870
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:07,570
Oh, my.

871
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:09,210
That chicken ain't right, bro.

872
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:10,270
Yeah, I kill it.

873
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:12,090
Might as well eat that chicken.

874
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:15,310
Like...

875
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,650
Bro, just get a real chicken.

876
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:21,410
Why you gotta make that chicken look, it's live action.

877
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:23,270
Is it supposed to be realistic?

878
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:26,490
Put it out of its misery.

879
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:29,310
It looks like it's in fucking pain.

880
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:35,930
It looks like a goddamn, like, it looks like one of those
chickens that should not have lived to this, like, live to

881
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:36,630
his adulthood.

882
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:40,670
Like, the mom would literally kill the chick before he could
grow up.

883
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:45,310
The mom would, like, look at that chicken and be like, I'm
not...

884
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:58,970
letting you grow up and just fucking eat it no it's true
what do you mean what the fuck that's what animals do like

885
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:08,070
like if it wasn't for human intervention a lot of babies
would have got eaten by the moms eating her crush um that's

886
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:15,270
why i talked about it before but that's why like um a lot of
like um some people are like oh that's so inhumane because

887
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:24,210
like um some farms they have to like cage the mommy pig
because if they don't cage them and they don't want to

888
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:31,950
continue if they don't cage them um they will crush the
babies if they don't they don't like the baby they're like i

889
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:40,070
don't think that child's right and the fucking mama pig will
roll over and crush the pig so they have to like cage it

890
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:47,610
because some mama pigs will like do that because they're
like that pig ain't right because like she feels it's like i

891
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:57,950
don't want this baby pig to grow up this child ain't right
like they take matters to their own hands and that's what

892
01:34:57,950 --> 01:35:08,570
like rodents do too um rodents like hamsters they would like
eat their children if like if there's one hamster um that's

893
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:15,890

question what if chickens were what if chickens were real

think chickens it's like you know trying to be like this is

899
01:35:57,230 --> 01:36:03,190

what if chickens were real this is what I think a chicken

900
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:08,090
would look like with my interpretation of all the fossils
those we saw in the world.

901
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:14,650
Mr. Broken Bun.

902
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:15,570
Thank you, Mr. Super Chat.

903
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:15,830
Thank you.

904
01:36:15,930 --> 01:36:16,330
Thank you.

905
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:20,570
If humans didn't intervene, pandas would have died up.

906
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:24,590
Yeah, no, I've always said pandas literally are alive
because of pretty privilege.

907
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:25,730
Thank God.

908
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:27,850
Thank God they're so fucking cute.

909
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:33,990
They're so fucking cute.

910
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:35,850
I mean, good, because they are really cute.

911
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:41,270
As someone that saw that I've seen pandas, IRL, up close,
They deserve it.

912
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:44,270
They deserve it.

913
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:56,470
Kowalas too.

914
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:57,010
Look.

915
01:36:58,210 --> 01:37:01,710
I can never see kowalas the same anymore because all of them
have chlamydia.

916
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:09,970
That's like, like I feel like sometimes I'm even like born
with chlamydia too.

917
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:12,670
I could never see kowalas the same.

918
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:14,050
What?

919
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:14,890
You guys don't know?

920
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:15,290
Yeah.

921
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:21,990
All koalas, like majority of koalas have chlamydia.

922
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:24,890
For those who, fun fact, fun fact.

923
01:37:27,810 --> 01:37:33,250
And also, they're really high all the time because they're
not supposed to eat eucalyptus leaves because eucalyptus

924
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,630
leaves actually make them incredibly high.

925
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:42,390
So like every koala you see not only has chlamydia, but are
also like, they're like, they're not there.

926
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:56,490
yeah they're not supposed to eat eucalyptus leaves but i
guess they just really like being high very fun fact

927
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:07,100
yeah they're all like they're all they're all zoomed out

928

01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,700
know, you can hide it too and everything.

1040
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,860
But, like, I feel like on the face is just too much.

1041
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,700
It's actually, like, it's just, it's just too much.

1042
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:50,120
Say that to Mike Tyson's face.

1043
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:53,720
Bro, okay, do you not remember how he got that?

1044
01:50:54,700 --> 01:51:01,860
Okay, when he, I think, like, when he got that tattoo, he
was, like, downhill, right, at that time.

1045
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:06,440
Like, he was literally, like, he was literally, like, on so
many fucking drugs.

1046
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:10,800
and substances that led to him like getting that tattoo.

1047
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,580
And like the hangover was his lyric.

1048
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:15,040
Like he was P crazy.

1049
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:21,520
And like at the hangover, when he was like at his lowest.

1050
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:27,840
And the only reason he like picked himself together was
because of the hangover movie.

1051
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:35,700
Because during the filming of the hangover movie in an
interview, he was saying like, bro, I don't even remember

1052
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:36,720
what was going on.

1053
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:45,740
during the hangover films because I was so fucked up that I
forgot I don't even remember what the fuck I was doing or

1054
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:53,220
like what was going on because I was so fucked up on every
type of substance during filming of that movie and that was

1055
01:51:53,220 --> 01:52:08,700
the top that was when he realized he had to get his life
together like he had to Like, it's not even method anymore.

1056
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:09,480
He was just...

1057
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,820
He was just...

1058
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:12,440
He was just being him.

1059
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:15,120
He...

1060
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:19,480
Yeah, he injected, like, everything during that filming of
that movie.

1061
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:24,480
Yeah, that punch was real.

1062
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:34,220
Yeah, it took that filming.

1063
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,080
Wait, hang over.

1064
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:36,800
I remember reading about that.

1065
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:37,940
I was like, holy shit.

1066
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:40,200
Um...

1067
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:46,940
Yeah, I was a drunk and high pig while filming.

1068
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,100
Bro, not, bro, he was blitzed out of his mind.

1069
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:53,640
Was it caught when you're on?

1070
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:55,300
Oh, my God.

1071
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:56,940
There's, like, a word for it.

1072
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:06,400
Bro, not only does he have every substance in his body, he
was also incredibly drunk.

1073
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:09,860
Yeah, cross.

1074
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,700
Is it crossfaded?

1075
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:14,220
Yeah, he was fucking crossfaded out of his mind during the
filming of that.

1076
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:17,580
That's crazy.

1077
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:24,740
Oh, bro.

1078
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:28,480
So he said he looked like a pig during the time of filming.

1079
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:33,560
Did not even know he was set to feature in a comedy classic.

1080
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,760
He just sticks showing out.

1081
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:39,120
They're like, we gotta go, you gotta do a filming of a movie
real quick.

1082
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:39,860
And he's like, what?

1083
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,840
I met the guys in a club.

1084
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:52,960
They were in the VIP section and I said this is where I
normally sit nobody's normally sits here So I went in there.

1085
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:58,700
I'm checking these guys to see what they're doing in my
section And it was Zach the other guy and he said we're

1086
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:04,160
gonna be in a movie with you I said yeah when and he said
tomorrow

1087
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:18,880
And I didn't know as I was drinking and smoking back then
doing drugs So eventually I had to go and do the movie and

1088
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,100
it was a success.

1089
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:21,440
Jesus Christ.

1090
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:23,120
Bro, that guy was like, whoa.

1091
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,080
I did.

1092
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,500
He's like, tomorrow.

1093
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:30,680
What?

1094
01:54:38,440 --> 01:54:43,500
No, I'm pretty sure the manager reminded him, but he was not
conscious as a person.

1095
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:50,520
But yeah, like anyway, as I said, I don't care about tattoos
or anything.

1096
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:56,020
don't have tattoos i think like you know some tattoos are
really cool um but i personally i'll never have a tattoo or

1097
01:54:56,020 --> 01:55:03,500
have earrings because i'm a fucking pussy when it comes to
pain um like like pussy when it comes to pain and doing

1098
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:09,720
anything to my body so like um but i do think like you know
like the water paint tattoo okay there's like some tattoos

1099
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:17,580
that i think are like really interesting and super cool like
the water paint tattoos and uh um pixel tattoos i think

1100
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:28,060
those um but i would never do that to myself but i will say
i think face tattoos look really fucking stupid i'm so sorry

1101
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:35,860
for any dragons that um that have face tattoos i'm really
it's just like personal preference i just think i just think

1102
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:47,340
like it doesn't look good it just i just personally just
don't think it looks good and i think it's really stupid

The Zootopia 2 market is just too good.

Look at you now.

1146
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:47,300
I love this song.

1147
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:48,950
It looks right for you in my head sometimes

1148
01:58:52,360 --> 01:59:03,520
Cover it when Anyway, anyway, okay, so speaking of Amazon,
so um, so you know like Black Friday So for those who don't

1149
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:10,760
live in America up black friday used to be like this wild
american tradition where right after thanksgiving you go

1150
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:21,740
fight um you go fight other your fellow americans for really
cheap bargains at your local store so apparently like maybe

1151
01:59:21,740 --> 01:59:27,740
run over some kids too like at the store with your car with
your shopping carts too because that used that used to be a

1152
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:34,960
thing like people actually died on black friday it was so up
back then like years ago uh before Before online shopping

1153
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:40,240
became a thing in America, right at the day after
Thanksgiving, where you get your thankful about like

1154
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:43,440
everything and your family and your job and your life and
everything.

1155
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:46,380
You know, you start being thankful for like, you know, thank
you.

1156
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:48,700
Thank you for the life you gave me.

1157
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:57,620
And then the day right after Thanksgiving on Black Friday,
they would fight each other and actually get into fist

1158
01:59:57,620 --> 02:00:04,020
fights or even like run like run over like employees to get.

1159
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:10,440
the cheapest bargain on like technology or like items or
whatever um or appliances yeah communism come your

1160
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:24,100
consumerism yeah uh shoppers used to actually uh go to war
and people actually fucking died like employees and workers

1161
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:31,180
and like you know um like other like other like customers
would some of them can actually will get like run over by

1162
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:42,200
other people uh just so they could the cheapest bargain
anyway apparently this year was like the lowest it's ever

1163
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:54,700
been for people actually like going going outside to find
bargains to like buy stuff because everyone was just online

1164
02:00:54,700 --> 02:01:02,020
shopping because apparently because in Amazon like it has
the similar deals but like they just sent a drone over and

1165
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:19,600
like ship it to you yeah um um so so that yeah so I guess
like it's it's it's good because there's less deaths now um

1166
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:27,680
there's not now there's less deaths going on on Black Friday
yeah so now because you know the things ship to you and you

1167
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:30,680
don't have to go outside and camp out of like a Target or
Walmart

1168
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:43,460
people's the stores started lying about prices now and
pretend to be like fake discounts so like days they would

1169
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:51,040
just like do like a fake 50 off or some shit you know they
would be like oh let me just add like times to the original

1170
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:59,220
price and then like put like slash 50 off so like stores do
that now to like pretend it's black friday so it's not

1171
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:11,780
actually a bargain anymore so that's why wanted to talk
about it because apparently like Target was so desperate was

1172
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:18,640
so desperate to get customers to show up on Black Friday
because like you know I guess like people realize like I

1173
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:25,860
guess like as the years go by like I guess like market
analysis team realize like people don't go out to shop

1174
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:33,460
anymore like malls are dying we all know that like everyone
knows uh malls are dying now like the reason why people go

1175
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:40,860
to malls these days are just to like uh to hang out or for
like the more entertainment malls not for actually shopping

1176
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:46,020
shopping anymore it's just for like either like just to hang
out or just to like there's like entertainment stuff to do

1177
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:53,480
or maybe restaurants or stuff majority of malls just have
restaurants nowadays um it's just food um so um so like I

1178
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:59,580
guess like Target was like yeah nobody really goes to shop
anymore I don't think like there's like less and less

1179
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:09,880
customers in uh um during black friday so what they did to
incentivize incentive to bus that incentivize i can't

1180
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:18,340
pronounce that shit for good english is my first language um
is that they were like the first hundred people who showed

1181
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:29,000
up at the location will get like a special gift bag and a
chance to win like um like the a chance to win like a grand

1182
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:39,960
prize and stuff a lottery so the sorry i'm looking up
opening up the video so apparently the crazy thing about it

1183
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:47,080
is that in the goodie bag like a hundred yeah the target
gift bag during black friday i remember i wanted to talk

1184
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:55,680
about it is that um it had wait what was it is filled with
Oonocards and nerds.

1185
02:03:57,700 --> 02:04:01,020
So, so the people, okay, I'm gonna have a screenshot.

1186
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:09,480
So the people who line up, by the way, like, they line up
for fucking hours, by the way, outside, in the freezing

1187
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:13,060
cold, because thank you, global warming, it also works the
opposite way.

1188
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:15,840
So I like how people were like, if it's global warming, why
is it so cold?

1189
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:23,440
Because global warming, although it has, I know it's like
the name, the warming part, is very count like um it's very

1190
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:30,400
counterintuitive because it's like oh it just means it's it
makes things warm but it also makes things really cold it

1191
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:37,420
goes both ways so it makes things really fucking cold during
the winter and really fucking hot during the summer so

1192
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:48,060
anyway anyway it's super fucking cold the day after
thanksgiving and people were like lining up for um for like

1193
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:56,080
hours in the just to get Uno cards and nerds.

1194
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:03,140
And I was like, holy fuck, that is so sad.

1195
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:05,120
This is their goodie bag, by the way.

1196
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:10,500
The first 100 customers at Target during Black Friday.

1197
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:17,320
So what is worse?

1198
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:20,660
Black Friday shopping after Thanksgiving in the U.S.

1199
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:23,600
Boxing Day after Christmas again.

1200
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:27,500
Wow, what?

1201
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,380
At least the bag's cool.

1202
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:33,740
I feel like the bag is more expensive than anything else
here.

1203
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:39,960
What is this loot pot level shit?

1204
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:43,400
Um.

1205
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:51,060
But yeah, no, that's like the incentive for people to line
up.

1206
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:52,900
during Black Friday outside.

1207
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:57,260
I feel like Boxing Day was never that bad.

1208
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:58,380
I think.

1209
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:04,740
I don't think Boxing Day ever got that bad in general.

1210
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:06,220
IMO.

1211
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:08,720
As someone that has...

1212
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:09,100
I don't know.

1213
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:11,560
I think people just order online now anyway.

1214
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:13,160
So it never got that bad.

1215
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:15,220
Hmm.

1216
02:06:18,190 --> 02:06:18,850
Yeah.

1217
02:06:19,690 --> 02:06:20,550
Oh yeah.

1218
02:06:20,670 --> 02:06:22,530
And also, just off topic.

1219
02:06:23,290 --> 02:06:35,630
um this is very off topic but for those who are into like dc
stuff or like uh um they had a new update on the absolute

1220
02:06:35,630 --> 02:06:42,510
series regarding absolute joker for those who don't know
anything about dc there's a new dc series right right now

1221
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:50,330
and it's literally like um one of the super villains fanfic
dark fanfic about the superheroes and the other super

1222
02:06:50,330 --> 02:06:57,850
villains so it's like his own There's a supervillain named
Darkside, and he made his own, um, his own, like, uh,

1223
02:06:57,850 --> 02:07:05,310
original characters, do not steal, uh, fan fiction about,
like, all the superheroes and supervillains in DC, and, um,

1224
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:09,850
there's a new update about his, yeah, his own, like, fanfic,
basically.

1225
02:07:10,330 --> 02:07:11,850
Um, oh, the new, no, music, sorry.

1226
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:15,330
Um, I had to look over a video real quick.

1227
02:07:15,550 --> 02:07:20,870
Um, and there's an update regarding Absolute Joker, and
apparently he eats babies.

1228
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:38,710
so no apparently like um he keeps a harem of women around
him so he can absorb their babies in the womb like that's

1229
02:07:38,710 --> 02:07:46,030
fucking crazy that's actually fucking so fucking evil so i
don't okay i don't know if he's the one that's getting the

1230
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:48,770
women pregnant but i think that's what it's

1231
02:07:52,550 --> 02:08:01,030
Joker has a harem of women that he just gets them pregnant
and then fucking absorbs the babies in the womb

1232
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:13,960
so yeah like bro that's just whoa that bro okay like

1233
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:29,000
yeah what the fuck yeah no not on that he's not eating the
baby i mean yeah he is eating the baby but the fact that it

1234
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:35,140
goes to like the next level where he just like absorbs it
from the womb is actually fucking crazy like i would not

1235
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:48,680
have thought of that like why would he do that yeah yeah
that's pretty like literally spawn camping them

1236
02:08:55,230 --> 02:09:03,270
yeah no i that was like i was like holy fuck that's that's
That's hardcore, man.

1237
02:09:03,930 --> 02:09:05,870
Bro, Dark Side is so edgy.

1238
02:09:06,230 --> 02:09:09,410
I mean, his name is literally Dark Side.

1239
02:09:11,230 --> 02:09:12,970
I'm literally looking through my bookmarks.

1240
02:09:13,070 --> 02:09:14,710
I was like, oh, yeah, I forgot about.

1241
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:17,270
I forgot about all of this.

1242
02:09:17,430 --> 02:09:19,470
All the stuff I wanted to talk to you guys about.

1243
02:09:21,070 --> 02:09:22,330
Who gets him pregnant?

1244
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:22,870
Joker.

1245
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:24,090
That's the thing.

1246
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:29,650
He keeps a harem of women so he has an endless supply of
babies that he can absorb.

1247
02:09:30,850 --> 02:09:31,990
I think that's the fucked up.

1248
02:09:32,070 --> 02:09:33,430
It's not just random women.

1249
02:09:33,690 --> 02:09:36,710
It's the most messed up part.

1250
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:38,430
It's not random women.

1251
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:43,210
He literally purposely keeps a harem of women so he can farm
the babies.

1252
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:47,430
He's literally farming the babies.

1253
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:55,160
So yeah.

1254
02:09:56,760 --> 02:10:00,800
Cool new fun update from the DC universe.

1255
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,840
That's going to be owned by Netflix, by the way.

1256
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:05,040
Little pivot over it.

1257
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:16,980
segue to the whole for those who don't know uh Warner
Brothers was just bought by Netflix now so um DC is now now

1258
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:29,380
owned by Netflix and Netflix has creative control over DC so
I don't know I don't know how that's gonna go I I don't I

1259
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:40,820
don't know how that is gonna go because like on one hand
care about like I guess like they don't really care in terms

1260
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:49,300
of like they'll like green light everything but also they
cancel everything too and that what's makes me scared

1261
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:57,500
because you know they've let pass a lot of crazy shit pass
to get green lit and everything but like a lot of shows get

1262
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:10,540
cancelled after like one season too so that makes me scared
really scared because it's like you know um i feel like one

1263
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:22,060
season is not enough for a show to grow on its own because
season one is where people experiment and try to find their

1264
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:27,600
footing on things like trying to find their footing and
where they're at as a show like as a show like trying to

1265
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:33,780
experiment see like you know what works and what doesn't
work and season two is usually where it starts picking up um

1266
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:39,740
yeah so i What they like to do is just if season 1 isn't
like a hit right away.

1267
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:40,940
They just cancel it.

1268
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:42,320
They're just like, what the fuck.

1269
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:43,860
Like, you don't make us enough money.

1270
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:44,880
It's not streamable.

1271
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:51,080
Yeah, or they cancel shit that's popular.

1272
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,400
I'm inside job.

1273
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:55,680
I will fucking, I will not let them live it down.

1274
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:57,720
I'm so upset.

1275
02:11:57,800 --> 02:11:59,940
I still can't believe they canceled inside job.

1276
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:03,640
It's, I swear, I swear to God, I know I keep saying it.

1277
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:09,200
I swear to God, inside job was an actual inside job because
they got too close to the truth.

1278
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:14,880
And then somebody, like from the higher ups, I'm not, look
guys, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

1279
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:16,580
I'm not a conspiracy guy.

1280
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:20,300
But like, I swear to God, I think they got too close to the
truth.

1281
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:24,360
And some fucking higher up called up Netflix and was like,
take it down.

1282
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:31,840
Like, because it was such a, it was actually such a good
show.

1283
02:12:32,020 --> 02:12:36,480
I was so surprised it got canceled because the writing was
really good.

1284
02:12:36,660 --> 02:12:41,260
The characters, everyone was fucking talking about Inside
Job when it was airing.

1285
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:42,820
So, like, I don't understand.

1286
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:45,180
And the clips got, like, millions of views.

1287
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:48,680
So, like, I don't understand how it got canceled.

1288
02:12:49,140 --> 02:12:55,760
And so I swear, I swear someone fucking, someone called
Netflix and was like, you gotta, you gotta cancel this.

1289
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:57,060
They're way too close to the truth.

1290
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:58,500
They know too much.

1291
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:04,660
thing put that tin foil hat on

1292
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:15,620
the castle gems like inside job but keep big mouthing it was
super chat thank you thank you it's because it's filled with

1293
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:23,620
celebrities too that's the thing i think big mouth stayed
only because like the creators of big mouth were like super

1294
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:31,160
famous and they just wanted like to make them happy like um
i don't know if you guys know like they wanted to make them

1295
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:38,280
happy and keep the connection too because it's all about
like connections as well and um the creators of bigmouth are

1296
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:46,480
really really really famous hollywood actors and also like
they know everyone too so you know it's like how how adam

1297
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:54,140
sandler got like a was it a five plus year contract i think
it was like 10 year contract was it guys i don't remember

1298
02:13:54,140 --> 02:14:00,560
how many years it was it was like five to 10 year contract
with netflix um and like they just give him like it doesn't

1299
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:07,200
matter how shitty the movies are because it was so bad like
you guys gotta admit all the movies that Adam Sandler made

1300
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:17,560
for Netflix was so fucking bad but like it was literally a
paid vacation for him to do whatever the fuck he wants like

1301
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:24,140
I swear to God like the deal the it's just he literally gets
like a paid vacation from Netflix to travel to wherever the

1302
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:31,740
fuck he wants to and then have Netflix hire all his friends
Like, I swear to God, Adam Sandler's friends, like,

1303
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:34,300
maturiate them.

1304
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:43,180
The only way they'll ever get hired is in an Adam Sandler
movie, just because they're friends with Adam Sandler.

1305
02:14:43,540 --> 02:14:45,640
And, like, it's literally payday for them.

1306
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:48,100
Like, the trip with him and his homies.

1307
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:51,540
It doesn't even matter how shitty the movie is.

1308
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:52,400
He's already paid.

1309
02:14:57,400 --> 02:15:00,860
Now that Netflix has HBO, oh, yeah, also Netflix has HBO, by
the way.

1310
02:15:00,980 --> 02:15:02,380
HBO is owned by Warner Brothers.

1311
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:11,210
Hey, sir.

1312
02:15:11,490 --> 02:15:12,290
Thank you for the super chat.

1313
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:12,610
Thank you.

1314
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:13,390
Thank you.

1315
02:15:13,850 --> 02:15:19,090
Maybe they can't go back and time and cancel that awful
games of Rosie.

1316
02:15:19,430 --> 02:15:20,310
You know what I'm looking forward to?

1317
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:24,210
Maybe they'll fucking get rid of the HBO streaming services.

1318
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:27,310
So finally, all the HBO shows are on Netflix.

1319
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:30,810
Because you know what fucking sucks?

1320
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:34,750
In Canada, we don't have HBO streaming services.

1321
02:15:35,090 --> 02:15:37,130
We have to have this other streaming service.

1322
02:15:37,150 --> 02:15:54,290
is called crave fuck crave like we don't even get to have
this shit it's not goddamn crave not even on hbo crave

1323
02:15:54,290 --> 02:16:04,130
fucking sucks i hate crave yeah crave doesn't even work
right at least though you know what no i you know what fuck

1324
02:16:04,130 --> 02:16:10,050
yeah i'm actually happy that netflix got So now actually the
HBO shows are on Netflix now.

1325
02:16:10,510 --> 02:16:17,230
Oh my god, we don't at least guys Here's a good thing about
Netflix buying Warner Brothers less streaming services

1326
02:16:21,790 --> 02:16:23,510
Less streaming services.

1327
02:16:23,890 --> 02:16:25,730
I just need Netflix

1328
02:16:30,030 --> 02:16:33,130
But at what cost

1329
02:16:36,150 --> 02:16:47,190
The monkey paw is Bless the monopoly Look At least it's Okay
guys Let's look at the bright side of things Like let's look

1330
02:16:47,190 --> 02:16:55,550
at them At least it's not owned by Disney Thank God I do not
want them to do what they did to Marvel Like I don't care

1331
02:16:55,550 --> 02:17:04,830
what you guys think I think I think Disney ruined Marvel
Like this is my hot take I think Marvel was so sanitized

1332
02:17:05,450 --> 02:17:14,810
Because they got bought by Disney That like All the stories
regarding like Marvel like movie and comics are just they're

1333
02:17:14,810 --> 02:17:27,410
not that interesting anymore And Star Wars too, I would say
So at least Disney didn't fucking doesn't fucking own Warner

1334
02:17:27,410 --> 02:17:37,590
Brothers like so at least that's the bright side Could have
been worse It could have been worse

1335
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:47,680
Disney ruined Star Wars with exception of Rogue One, Andor,
and Mandalorian.

1336
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:49,540
I've never watched Rogue One and Andor.

1337
02:17:49,540 --> 02:17:50,700
I've always wanted to, though.

1338
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,460
I think Mandalorian was really good.

1339
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:55,780
Until Disney.

1340
02:17:58,420 --> 02:18:00,000
Pushed Grogu everywhere.

1341
02:18:00,740 --> 02:18:01,400
And then...

1342
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:04,740
And then Pedro Pascal took off the helmet.

1343
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:09,060
Because nobody wants to watch the Mandalorian when he
doesn't wear a helmet.

1344
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:10,720
Like, what the fuck is that?

1345
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:12,940
Bro, that kills my immersion.

1346
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:27,940
bro like we liked you when you kept the helmet on bro like
you were haunted when you had the helmet like stop i don't

1347
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:38,300
want you this i don't want to see you without the helmet man
yeah the helmet stays on he just looks cooler with the

1348
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:49,640
helmet okay does he ruin the mountain delorean with three
things they push grogu on too much and also like just i wish

1349
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:57,540
he was baby yoda to be fair i think like i think baby grogu
would have been much more popular if he was just baby he was

1350
02:18:57,540 --> 02:19:04,040
actually just baby yoda i don't fucking care people like
that doesn't make sense doki like in the story and lore plot

1351
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:11,460
wise i think if he kept being called baby Yoda he'd still be
popular the moment they revealed that his name was Grogu

1352
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:21,980
nobody cared about him yeah no one cared about him the
moment they were like his name's actually his name is Grogu

1353
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:31,320
and I'm like I don't fucking care at least name him Yoda Jr
at least that's better like

1354
02:19:35,060 --> 02:19:38,500
um Yeah, all the charm gone.

1355
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:40,120
And I was like, Grogu.

1356
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:41,800
Like, all, yeah.

1357
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:44,860
All the charm gone about Baby Yoda.

1358
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:51,740
Um, um, and like, and also, okay, second thing, Pedro Pascal
should have kept his helmet on.

1359
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:55,060
I'm not watching the Mandalorian for his helmet to be
fucking off.

1360
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:59,680
Everyone was watching it because the fucking bounty hunter
outfit was badass as fuck.

1361
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:02,940
And the fact that he took his helmet off ruined it for me.

1362
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:06,180
Um, because, like, it's fine if he does it, like, once or
twice.

1363
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:12,620
every like season like maybe once every season even then
that's like a little bit too much but he took it he added

1364
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:18,760
off like so many times and like the whole mystery of it was
just gone it wasn't like it wasn't interesting anymore like

1365
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:23,380
he should have just i don't care i don't care if he's hot or
not like i don't care i just think that he looks better with

1366
02:20:23,380 --> 02:20:34,100
the helmet the character was so much better with the helmet
on um yeah and then like the third point the cgi um luke

1367
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:39,900
skywalker It's like, that was, I don't understand.

1368
02:20:40,420 --> 02:20:45,760
Like, I know, okay, the thing is, Disney loves doing defix,
like, loves doing CGI and defix.

1369
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:53,160
Because, like, if anyone ever watched Tron Legacy, they did
that with Jeff Bridges and everything.

1370
02:20:53,260 --> 02:20:56,500
Like, they love experimenting with, like, defix and CGI.

1371
02:20:56,820 --> 02:21:03,080
But it's so, like, the thing is, they would get actors that
actually looked like the original actors.

1372
02:21:03,700 --> 02:21:06,240
And then they would just CGI on top of it.

1373
02:21:06,260 --> 02:21:13,900
And I'm like, bro, just use the fucking, uh, use the actors
you scouted out that look like the original actors.

1374
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:17,340
Um, like, like, that's okay.

1375
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:21,180
I feel like they pass.

1376
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:24,960
Like, like, what's the point of you just gonna CGI the face
anyway?

1377
02:21:28,810 --> 02:21:31,870
Actually got a good fucking face double, too.

1378
02:21:33,690 --> 02:21:34,710
Like, I didn't understand.

1379
02:21:34,810 --> 02:21:36,610
That was my gripes about the Mandalorian.

1380
02:21:38,010 --> 02:21:43,710
And then George, people were like, like, George, why didn't
you stop Disney from doing that?

1381
02:21:43,770 --> 02:21:46,770
And he's like, bro, I don't fucking own Star Wars anymore.

1382
02:21:47,010 --> 02:21:53,130
Like, there was a recent, there was a recent panel.

1383
02:21:53,890 --> 02:21:58,210
There was a fucking recent panel that George Lucas did.

1384
02:21:59,470 --> 02:22:00,290
Like did.

1385
02:22:00,530 --> 02:22:07,090
And then people, fans were like, yelling at him, being like,
why didn't you stop this from happening?

1386
02:22:08,010 --> 02:22:11,090
Why did this happen and why did that happen?

1387
02:22:11,250 --> 02:22:15,370
And then he literally was like, bro, I don't even own Star
Wars anymore.

1388
02:22:15,570 --> 02:22:16,470
I sold it.

1389
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:19,830
He's like, stop complaining to me.

1390
02:22:20,110 --> 02:22:23,030
I have no control over it.

1391
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:23,590
Like,

1392
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:29,090
he can't do anything.

1393
02:22:29,310 --> 02:22:32,890
He has literally no control over Star Wars.

1394
02:22:39,350 --> 02:22:41,130
Yeah, he literally got paid.

1395
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:46,810
He's like, oh, yeah, like, okay, wait, I got, let's see.

1396
02:22:47,570 --> 02:22:52,990
George Lucas has moved past Star Wars 13 years after selling
it to Disney for $4 billion.

1397
02:22:53,210 --> 02:22:55,710
And he's like, I've got a life now.

1398
02:22:57,030 --> 02:22:58,190
Wait, let me read the article.

1399
02:22:59,470 --> 02:22:59,790

02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:02,470

02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:55,360
I'm sorry.

1417
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:56,740
Okay, I'm gonna say something.

1418
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:02,900
I'm gonna say something really, really fucked up, guys.

1419
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:14,320
The one show that was keeping Star Trek relevant was Big
Bang Theory.

1420
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:33,660
guys i know the truth hurts guys but you have to admit the
only one of the biggest reasons why like a lot of like the

1421
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:44,780
generations like after the like the current generations knew
about star trek was because big band theory kept referencing

1422
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:55,340
star trek 24 7 and it kept the show like relevancy alive
because of that and you guys can't be like you can't say

1423
02:25:55,340 --> 02:26:05,920
that big band theory wasn't even that popular guys you don't
understand how much of a cultural impact big band theory had

1424
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:10,600
to the normies because okay big band okay

1425
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:34,660
but the jj abridds movies so guys it had 17.31 million
viewers each season they would it was like top 10 show like

1426
02:26:34,660 --> 02:26:46,220
every year you guys know i know the truth hurts stop
spreading this information guys i'm so sorry but every

02:26:57,740 --> 02:27:01,600

1430
02:27:17,420 --> 02:27:24,780

handle the truth

02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:36,480

getting canceled

1432
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:45,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1433
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:46,000
Thank you.

1434
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:46,620
Thank you.

1435
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:47,160
Oh, sorry.

1436
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:55,880
It's Big Bang Theory and Family Guy because Seth MacFarlane
fucking is also ever since ever since Big Bang Theory ended.

1437
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:02,740
It's only Seth is Seth MacFarlane's time to keep keep the
series alive.

1438
02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:05,600
Yeah.

1439
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:09,500
Now it's just now it's just Family Guy holding it together.

1440
02:28:14,340 --> 02:28:15,540
pillar left.

1441
02:28:18,390 --> 02:28:22,030
That Google Doc where no doc has gotten before.

1442
02:28:24,690 --> 02:28:25,890
You guys know I'm right.

1443
02:28:26,010 --> 02:28:28,410
You're only booing me because you're in denial.

1444
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:36,760
He also made an animated show, didn't he?

1445
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:38,940
Like an actual Star Trek show.

1446
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:41,100
Seth McFarlane.

1447
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:46,620
No, I actually know Orville.

1448
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:48,200
That's what I was saying.

1449
02:28:55,040 --> 02:29:01,600
I actually watched because of it kept fucking they kept
fucking giving me YouTube shorts about it so that I checked

1450
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:02,660
it out

1451
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:23,120
but yeah as I was saying as I was saying Big Bang Theory
kept the show alive to the normies even though it ended

1452
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:31,860
first oh yeah and also Seth fucking it Seth is like I swear
to God I think like the only reason what's named Picard

1453
02:29:31,860 --> 02:29:44,300
Picard I feel like literally Seth McFarland has like Picard
on a leash because he's like you're not you mean you'll be

1454
02:29:44,300 --> 02:29:57,060
on because he's such a fan boy of Star Trek he literally has
him like like leashed up for all his shows he's like you're

1455
02:29:57,060 --> 02:29:57,680
never leaving

1456
02:30:06,730 --> 02:30:08,290
Yeah, Patrick Stewart.

1457
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:15,180
You mean Sir Patrick Stewart?

1458
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:24,860
I bet you Seth pays him a lot of fucking money just so he
can be just so he can like have him on American Dad.

1459
02:30:32,890 --> 02:30:35,370
Because he's like such a fucking fanboy.

1460
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:41,360
Also, guys.

1461
02:30:48,150 --> 02:30:50,150
My first introduction to Star Trek.

1462
02:30:51,770 --> 02:31:04,670
You're like, say it dokey to prove my point to prove my
point my very first introduction to Star Trek.

1463
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:08,930
Don't say it.

1464
02:31:09,350 --> 02:31:11,710
Don't you dare.

1465
02:31:17,270 --> 02:31:21,490
Some things are best left unsaid.

1466
02:31:23,130 --> 02:31:29,810
My very first introduction to Star Trek.

1467
02:31:34,890 --> 02:31:42,930
but okay okay i'll keep it a mystery guys i'll keep so you
can be disappointed or not in your heads but we all know the

1468
02:31:42,930 --> 02:31:53,150
answer we all know the real answer in your heart okay for
the dragoons who wish to cope you can think of a different

1469
02:31:53,150 --> 02:31:57,490
answer but you know what the real answer is you

1470
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:09,600
Don't you please say it?

1471
02:32:16,280 --> 02:32:18,600
All right, anyway, what was I talking about before?

1472
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:24,420
But that is crazy that...

1473
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:28,920
That's actually crazy that Netflix now owns, like, Warner
Brothers and HBO.

1474
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:31,740
It makes me wonder what they're going to do with that
property.

1475
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:34,840
Say it, break our hearts!

1476
02:32:36,040 --> 02:32:38,640
Bird, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1477
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:44,880
What I'm surprised is that they're not doing anything with
the Star Trek brand anymore.

1478
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:47,560
Not actually doing anything with it.

1479
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:49,060
Star Trek.

1480
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:51,200
What is the newest thing they did for it?

1481
02:32:59,270 --> 02:33:02,210
Okay, Star Trek Starfleet Academy.

1482
02:33:02,770 --> 02:33:04,570
That's only on Paramount Plus.

1483
02:33:04,730 --> 02:33:07,230
Okay, no wonder no one talks about Star Trek anymore.

1484
02:33:07,350 --> 02:33:10,110
You can only get it on Paramount Plus.

1485
02:33:10,650 --> 02:33:13,250
Like, who the fuck has Paramount Plus?

1486
02:33:14,830 --> 02:33:16,150
I feel like it's old.

1487
02:33:16,690 --> 02:33:21,930
just like netflix that's what i'm saying i think i think
it's either disney or netflix are gonna buy paramount

1488
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:37,020
yeah it's only on paramount plus me you are you and like 900
people that have the streaming

1489
02:33:40,350 --> 02:33:51,620
surface oh is it a perk for working at walmart oh i didn't
know that i don't know it like goes with walmart by the way

1490
02:33:51,620 --> 02:33:56,060
we don't have paramount plus in in canada i think Let me
check.

1491
02:33:57,280 --> 02:33:58,340
Let me...

1492
02:33:58,340 --> 02:34:01,000
I didn't even know that existed as a streaming service.

1493
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:05,740
Oh, wait.

1494
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:06,860
Oh, we...

1495
02:34:06,860 --> 02:34:07,560
Oh, my God.

1496
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:08,140
Wait.

1497
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:10,100
Oh, we do have it.

1498
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:13,380
Oh, but the Canadian version is different.

1499
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:15,340
Never mind.

1500
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:19,120
What do we have on there?

1501
02:34:23,380 --> 02:34:27,120
To get the full US library, users in Canada have to use a
VPN.

1502
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:29,940
What do we even have on...

1503
02:34:29,960 --> 02:34:32,660
When do we even have a Paramount Plus?

1504
02:34:41,450 --> 02:34:44,110
Apparently it's just like...

1505
02:34:45,050 --> 02:34:46,830
Apparently we have a...

1506
02:34:46,830 --> 02:34:49,010
Oh, okay, we don't have the NFL.

1507
02:34:49,290 --> 02:34:50,190
But two ones...

1508
02:34:50,190 --> 02:34:52,170
I'm sorry, I'm not a sport person.

1509
02:34:53,530 --> 02:34:55,990
I'm barely an esport person too.

1510
02:35:00,850 --> 02:35:03,170
Yeah, you can subscribe to it, but there's barely any...

1511
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:04,370
Yeah, I was so surprised.

1512
02:35:04,470 --> 02:35:05,790
I was like, Paramount Plus?

1513
02:35:06,270 --> 02:35:07,810
Like, what?

1514
02:35:08,130 --> 02:35:09,430
I just know Crave?

1515
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:15,750
I just know Crave, because that's their, like, alternative
to HBO, because we don't have HBO in Canada.

1516
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:23,140
Or are you barely an esports person?

1517
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:24,620
I don't watch esports that much.

1518
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:26,180
I don't know.

1519
02:35:26,260 --> 02:35:29,900
I like watching, like, I like watching gamers.

1520
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:37,600
I'm not like, I don't watch esports in general.

1521
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:42,320
Because it's like, I don't know, it depends on the games.

1522
02:35:50,590 --> 02:35:52,070
Yeah, I just want to play.

1523
02:35:52,190 --> 02:36:00,550
I'm just here to game It's like how like I like playing
volleyball I like playing soccer But I don't like watching

1529
02:36:53,430 --> 02:36:56,110
I don't remember the chant, but I love the chant for it.

1530
02:37:01,630 --> 02:37:04,830
Like, I remember the chant for it, but that shit was fire.

1531
02:37:05,830 --> 02:37:11,270
I didn't know that chant because, um, how do I know that?

1532
02:37:11,590 --> 02:37:21,170
Because I used to go to international school, and, um, and
all my Korean friends will do that chant, It was like a hype

02:37:30,510 --> 02:37:32,070
I feel like I'm butchering it.

1538
02:37:35,110 --> 02:37:38,610
We would like chant that during like sport events at school.

1539
02:37:39,250 --> 02:37:41,670

Oh, oh, I love these, like, I love these like, like sport

1560
02:39:39,470 --> 02:39:46,970

1562
02:39:52,130 --> 02:39:53,230
Yeah, it's pretty hype.

1563
02:39:55,350 --> 02:40:03,870
and the australian chat um is one of my favorite like uh
like sport chants and everything but yeah like i would say

1564
02:40:03,870 --> 02:40:18,330
like the only two sporting events that i was like super
hyped about and like um and uh uh and like i actually

1565
02:40:18,330 --> 02:40:27,210
watched like sporting events was literally like the um what
was it the like I said, the World Cup in South Africa

1566
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:37,650
because it's like, because of Shakira and the Vuvuzela's
walka walka oh and also the octopus it's because of the

1567
02:40:37,650 --> 02:40:50,290
octopus by the way but those who don't remember the famous
World Cup octopus came from the South Africa the South

1568
02:40:50,290 --> 02:40:58,150
Africa World Cup so I think it was an octopus, yeah the
octopus guys oh my god that's a throwback the very the

1569
02:40:58,150 --> 02:41:07,390
craziest uh uh animal prediction thing so paul the octopus
apparently predicted like i remember this when it was

1570
02:41:07,390 --> 02:41:18,610
happening um he would like he would successfully predict the
winner of each match during the world cup And everyone's

1571
02:41:18,610 --> 02:41:23,990
like, whoa, Paul Heavy was cheering on for Paul.

1572
02:41:24,230 --> 02:41:29,130
He's like, Paul, who do you think is going to, he was like a
Magic 8-ball.

1573
02:41:29,270 --> 02:41:33,450
He's like, who do you think is going to win the World Cup?

1574
02:41:36,490 --> 02:41:44,590
And he somehow managed to get every fucking pick right,
except for like, what the last game, right?

1575
02:41:44,590 --> 02:41:45,190
I don't remember.

1576
02:41:45,590 --> 02:41:49,270
It was like, it was either the last game or the last two
games.

1577
02:41:49,410 --> 02:41:59,010
fucked up but he was he literally had like he was like he
was a prediction master he was a savant of like soccer uh

1578
02:41:59,010 --> 02:42:12,270
yeah i think he got every prediction right until the i just
said my finals are the finals i don't remember imagine the

1579
02:42:12,270 --> 02:42:21,830
amount of money people like imagine the amount of money
people won by betting against paul Yeah, he had a fucking

1580
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:23,030
streak going.

1581
02:42:23,570 --> 02:42:25,350
Also, Waka Waka, too.

1582
02:42:25,650 --> 02:42:31,470
That's, like, the reason why I think South Africa World Cup
was the most hyped, like, sporting event ever.

1583
02:42:31,770 --> 02:42:33,630
Like, it just, everything just led to it.

1584
02:42:33,710 --> 02:42:38,170
Literally, Waka Waka, Vufu Zetas, and fucking Paul the
Octopus.

1585
02:42:39,050 --> 02:42:44,310
Waka, Waka is, like, the fucking best, like, sporting, like,
World Cup Sonic ever done.

1586
02:42:45,390 --> 02:42:46,370
I need to listen to it.

1587
02:42:50,590 --> 02:42:51,310
battles

1588
02:43:08,570 --> 02:43:21,810
do you guys know Shakira so the Waka Waka song oh my god did
she really no sense it's Africa walk on a a zombie omina

1589
02:43:21,810 --> 02:43:32,430
zombie you are this is africa this is such a good song i
feel like okay the thing is sakira i feel like all okay this

1590
02:43:32,430 --> 02:43:46,470
is a hard take but like shakira's songs i think like
shakira's songs they all sound very similar but they're all

1591
02:43:46,470 --> 02:43:57,290
really good they all sound really similar but yet i feel
like it doesn't matter to me because they they're they're

1592
02:43:57,290 --> 02:44:03,890
bops though they're they're pretty good even though they all
like i would i would keep taking the same song over and over

1593
02:44:03,890 --> 02:44:20,000
again like she figured it out you know she figured out the
system she knows what it's like what's her name megan

1594
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:34,480
trainer trainer like her songs all sound the same but like
she she figured it out she knows she cracked the code it's

1595
02:44:34,480 --> 02:44:47,240
like her and megan they both like know what people want like
from them yeah don't change what isn't broken i've

1596
02:44:51,110 --> 02:45:00,590
never listened to spanish version but i grew up with the
english version Waka Waka A-A-A Bada-na-na-na-na-na-na

1597
02:45:00,590 --> 02:45:10,410
Because this is Africa Bada-na-na A-A Waka Waka A-A-A Okay,
I love that song I love that song But like I said, yeah

1598
02:45:10,410 --> 02:45:19,910
Those two events Are the only events I know When it comes to
sports But yeah, I don't care much about Um I don't care

02:46:50,330 --> 02:46:52,170
Our team does not do that well.

1613
02:46:53,270 --> 02:46:54,870
Women's soccer, on the other hand.

1614
02:46:55,010 --> 02:46:56,110

02:46:57,810 --> 02:46:59,970

World Cup soccer.

1619
02:47:03,190 --> 02:47:03,750
Canada.

1620
02:47:04,450 --> 02:47:11,570
I don't know about like our soccer team in Canada.

1621
02:47:18,220 --> 02:47:19,540
Do we do okay?

1622

Canada at the FIFA.

02:47:22,620 --> 02:47:23,560
All right, let's see.

1624
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:25,600
Overall record.

1625
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:26,640
Did not enter.

1626
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:27,540
Did not qualify.

1627
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:28,240
Did not enter.

1628
02:47:28,380 --> 02:47:29,140
Did not qualify.

1629
02:47:29,460 --> 02:47:30,020
24th.

1630
02:47:30,100 --> 02:47:30,840
Did not qualify.

1631
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:32,040
31st.

1632
02:47:32,060 --> 02:47:37,300
Qualified as... Yeah, no.

1633
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:44,880
Yeah, I know I remember because I get disappointed whenever
i when i started when i was watching when i try to watch uh

1634
02:47:44,880 --> 02:47:56,200
yeah no this is an incredible record from canon this is so
sad i'm sorry this actually okay i'm so sad this is pretty

1635
02:47:56,200 --> 02:48:03,340
sad to look at because i was like we do are we ever had a
good year because i like i know i don't pay i don't pay much

1636
02:48:03,340 --> 02:48:09,780
attention like i do pay attention to um to like you know if
we do well I pay attention.

1637
02:48:09,940 --> 02:48:12,560
So that's why I don't pay much attention to FIFA World Cup.

1638
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:15,060
Because, like, Canada's never sort of...

1639
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:16,660
They've never really done well.

1640
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:21,300
We tried, and that's all that matters, right?

1641
02:48:24,900 --> 02:48:25,940
So, wait.

1642
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:27,760

1643
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:28,560

Okay, let me show you guys the record.

02:48:34,280 --> 02:48:35,820
Not, like, looking at it.

1647
02:48:38,120 --> 02:48:38,520
Okay.

That's like the Korean collaboration that we did, I think,
like last year.

1687
02:51:51,660 --> 02:51:55,400
So if you are in Korea, yeah, there's no, unfortunately
there's no international stripping.

1688
02:51:55,940 --> 02:52:00,820
But if you're in Korea, you'll be able to find it when we
did the Korean collab a year or two.

1689
02:52:00,880 --> 02:52:02,980
I think like a year and a half ago is there.

1718
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:55,020
but when I used to play soccer that shit is I was so happy I
was a goalkeeper up

1719
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:09,440
because like all right here's like for those who don't play
soccer and was like it's not can't be that big like for

1720
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:19,980
those who don't know how big a soccer field is like that's
crazy that he's able to still do this at in his 40s like

1721
02:57:19,980 --> 02:57:23,960
that look how tiny this person is

1722
02:57:30,640 --> 02:57:41,360
like no fit football fields are fucking huge like yeah yeah
that's um like oh my god

1723
02:57:45,800 --> 02:57:57,660
they look like ants like bro like how many people can line
up on the lid so the fact like so you guys are like yeah but

1724
02:57:57,660 --> 02:58:05,000
he's not running back and forth it's still a lot of running
even like half-field is he a forward or midfielder oh sucks

1725
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:15,240
for the midfielders not gonna lie not gonna lie and like by
the way for those who don't know how long a game is okay i

1726
02:58:15,240 --> 02:58:21,860
don't know if it's okay how long is a game and so i just
don't want to be like wrong but it's like two 45 minute

1727
02:58:21,860 --> 02:58:30,940
halves so like that's like yeah that's like 90 minute a 90
minute match running back and forth that's like doing like

1728
02:58:30,940 --> 02:58:41,100
um running back and forth back and forth back and forth and
also having enough energy to fucking kick the ball like that

1729
02:58:41,100 --> 02:58:51,200
shit that shit is a lot and being 40 and doing all of this
too that's a lot of fucking running in your 40s like i say

1730
02:58:51,200 --> 02:59:03,660
like you know like like in basketball, I feel like you can
um, so be like, how old is um, a bronze, okay, so like you

1731
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:13,160
can be like, well, the bronze James is 40, but a basketball
court is like, okay, I'll let you guys know how this is the

1732
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:14,540
size of a basketball court.

1733
02:59:15,820 --> 02:59:19,760
Like, I'm sorry, but this is the size of a basketball court.

1734
02:59:20,380 --> 02:59:20,840
Okay.

1735
02:59:25,660 --> 02:59:36,340
I'm sorry Like this is a soccer field Yeah Yeah Yeah it's a
lot small Like I would say like I feel like you know you can

1736
02:59:36,340 --> 02:59:45,360
be 40 You can be 40 And oh yeah Basketball has like more
timeouts too But like even like Like a basketball court is

1737
02:59:45,360 --> 02:59:54,160
like this size Like even then It's like this size Like but a
soccer field It's fucking crazy yeah

1738
02:59:58,400 --> 03:00:05,400
grass is easier but it depends on the shoes the thing is
like basketball shoes is all about the pumps because like

1739
03:00:05,400 --> 03:00:14,460
okay the reason why I know so much about this because I did
sports um I did a lot like I did I was in varsity for um I

1740
03:00:14,460 --> 03:00:27,240
did uh I did varsity for uh soccer basketball volleyball um
and in badminton um and like no grass is not easier it's not

1741
03:00:27,240 --> 03:00:33,380
but like running cleats is like a lot of work like as
someone that like running in cleats versus wearing in like

1742
03:00:33,380 --> 03:00:40,780
specific basketball shoes like run like basketball shoes for
it so like run especially like i almost twisted my ankle if

1743
03:00:40,780 --> 03:00:46,220
the grass is just fucked up and even if the grass is like a
little fucked up that's why they have to like check the

1744
03:00:46,220 --> 03:00:53,600
grass um depending on like how what field you are they
people have to check their grass all the time Because, like,

1745
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:58,860
if the grass is, like, even a little bit, like, bumpy, it
will fuck your cleats up.

1746
03:00:58,880 --> 03:01:00,220
Like, it will fuck your ankles up.

1747
03:01:00,420 --> 03:01:02,040
Because it's not fun to run in.

1748
03:01:02,540 --> 03:01:04,300
Yeah, because the earth is always uneven.

1749
03:01:04,400 --> 03:01:07,880
So that's why they're always checking the field to make sure
the field is even and everything.

1750
03:01:08,240 --> 03:01:09,500
So it's not fun.

1751
03:01:12,620 --> 03:01:13,020
Yeah.

1752
03:01:13,380 --> 03:01:19,900
So that's why I'm like, it's very impressive to see that,
you know, is Ronaldo also for Eddie?

1753
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:21,020
It's very impressive.

1754
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:31,320
Physically incredibly fit to be able to do this like in
their 40s like running back and forth in their like you can

1755
03:01:31,320 --> 03:01:41,360
say that They're not running all the way back, but it's
still a big fucking field And also whoever's the midfielder

1756
03:01:41,360 --> 03:01:47,560
like it sucks because like you know strikers always get the
most attention Just like you know, they're always scoring

1757
03:01:47,560 --> 03:01:54,740
the goals Because they're always scoring the goals and
everything you You know, getting a point is really, really

1758
03:01:54,740 --> 03:01:56,920
fucking hard in soccer.

1759
03:01:57,400 --> 03:02:01,020
So, like, strikers tend to be the most popular player in the
team.

1760
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:04,400
Like, you know, because, you know, cooking.

1761
03:02:04,760 --> 03:02:05,980
So, but, like, yeah.

1762
03:02:06,460 --> 03:02:14,040
But, like, being a midfielder, like, having to go, like,
yeah, running back in form, that shit must be so fucking

1763
03:02:14,040 --> 03:02:14,620
tiring.

1764
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Like, that shit must be hell.

1765
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:21,640
I was playing goalkeeper.

1766
03:02:21,820 --> 03:02:22,960
I was doing, like, why?

1767
03:02:22,980 --> 03:02:29,180
didn't know this so i told i did varsity i did varsity
sports in high school and middle school so i was very active

1768
03:02:29,180 --> 03:02:35,780
i was very active in high school and middle school before i
like went to gaming um that's why i have really good

1769
03:02:35,780 --> 03:02:43,880
hand-eye coordination because i was really good with my
hands like what like with my hand-eye coordination um so

1770
03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:51,240
like um you know that's why i was a goalkeeper too because
like i was able to catch balls really well and like i did

1771
03:02:51,240 --> 03:03:03,280
get okay i would i told you I told this story before but I
had no fear I was like I am as a goalkeeper I had no fucking

1772
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:09,540
fear and I would actually run in like if I see if I have
like you know like you know you're all about like checking

1773
03:03:09,540 --> 03:03:18,620
your like odds and stuff so like I was that goalkeeper that
I will run up to the striker and just die for the ball and

1774
03:03:18,620 --> 03:03:24,980
just do like the huddle thing and for those who know soccer
like you know you'd go you do straight dive and just huddle

1775
03:03:24,980 --> 03:03:33,600
like you do that and huddle and grab the ball I would I did
I do that um so I actually have no fucking fear and I have

1776
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:46,700
got kicked in the head like once I by like by one of like
the most famous striker like during a tournament where like

1777
03:03:48,020 --> 03:03:56,000
um I have got kicked in the head once by uh the the most
famous striker in like one of the schools we competed to get

1778
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:03,160
like in the tournament we competed in and there was this one
girl who was like one of the most scariest players i've ever

1779
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:08,960
played against and everyone knew her because she was like
the most talented like like she literally got a scholarship

1780
03:04:08,960 --> 03:04:17,360
uh for university for playing soccer um and it was very
impressive because she got scouted in an international

1781
03:04:17,360 --> 03:04:26,080
school environment um which is very hard for that to happen
because like like like you know normally you don't get

1782
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:33,760
scouted if you're in international school um because like
you know like so she literally got a scholarship for playing

1783
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:37,540
soccer um yeah i got kicked by the scholarship leg i ruined

1784
03:04:40,880 --> 03:04:53,840

1787
03:05:08,020 --> 03:05:12,900
it was like you know because we were it was like all
international schools competing against each other so it was

1788
03:05:12,900 --> 03:05:17,200
always really cool making friends with like other
international students from different schools and stuff

1789
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:22,900
because we always see each other we the only time we can

like um that's why I'm like, I'm really impressed.

1793
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:53,160
I'm really impressed with how, you know, how they're able to
stay so fucking consistent, even though they're like in

1794
03:05:53,160 --> 03:05:53,820
their 40s.

1795
03:05:53,980 --> 03:05:55,360
Cause holy fuck.

1796
03:05:58,740 --> 03:06:06,940
Like, like, you know, as you get older, like, you know, you
hear about how they'll have like back problems and muscle

1797
03:06:06,940 --> 03:06:08,180
aches and everything.

1798
03:06:08,480 --> 03:06:10,000
So I'm like, power to them.

1799
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:12,440
Like, power.

1800
03:06:12,460 --> 03:06:32,770
to these people can you even run still I don't know I don't
know I don't remember what it's like to run what

1801
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:51,400
do you mean I don't know because like when you ever get a
chance to run you know I feel like the older you get The

1802
03:06:51,400 --> 03:06:53,140
less you have to run.

1803
03:06:53,420 --> 03:06:54,580
You know what I mean?

1804
03:06:55,620 --> 03:06:59,040
Like, there's no reason to run anymore.

1805
03:06:59,720 --> 03:07:00,800
It's fun.

1806
03:07:02,320 --> 03:07:03,140
Oh, yeah.

1807
03:07:03,320 --> 03:07:05,980
Unless you want to, you know, do cardio and stuff.

1808
03:07:06,460 --> 03:07:06,740
Yeah.

1809
03:07:08,520 --> 03:07:11,660
I guess for, like, cardio and stuff, you know?

1810
03:07:12,340 --> 03:07:13,860
I just like the bike.

1811
03:07:13,940 --> 03:07:15,700
I like biking more than cardio.

1812
03:07:17,740 --> 03:07:18,540
Yeah, why?

1813
03:07:19,020 --> 03:07:21,060
Also, like, I just like doing the biking stuff.

1814
03:07:21,080 --> 03:07:23,680
stuff will

1815
03:07:27,160 --> 03:07:39,480
you participate in a mirror fuck no i'm sorry but as as a i
don't find enjoyment in running i know there's some people

1816
03:07:39,480 --> 03:07:46,740
that find enjoyment in running because of the adrenaline
rush they get from running i'm not unfortunately i'm not i'm

1817
03:07:46,740 --> 03:07:52,660
not that type of person but you're like well but doki you
did all those sports back then like why did you do it you

1818
03:07:52,660 --> 03:08:02,200
didn't enjoy like the from act from this i liked winning
that's really it i like i only participated in those in

1819
03:08:02,200 --> 03:08:11,660
those teams because of the rush of winning like i hated
practice i just liked winning in the tournament environment

1820
03:08:11,660 --> 03:08:21,580
fucking practice sucked because you're not actually
competing yeah i like the competition i just hate the

1821
03:08:21,580 --> 03:08:26,300
fucking lead up to it This wasn't fun.

1822
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:30,240
Because you're like, you're like, it's just like, you can't
win at, exactly.

1823
03:08:30,500 --> 03:08:32,460
You can't win at practice.

1824
03:08:36,580 --> 03:08:39,240
Yeah, I don't get runners high, whatever the fuck it's
called.

1825
03:08:39,560 --> 03:08:44,260
And the thing is, I did enough marathons as, you know, like
not marathons, but you know the mile run.

1826
03:08:44,460 --> 03:08:45,480
Fuck that shit.

1827
03:08:48,340 --> 03:08:51,160
I did enough mile runs in school.

1828
03:08:51,320 --> 03:08:53,560
I don't need to do that in my free time.

1829
03:09:01,900 --> 03:09:09,320
with the rest of your team yeah but it ain't the same ain't
the same you know why because like okay this is the fucked

1830
03:09:09,320 --> 03:09:15,780
up part like it's just it's not the same because in practice
matches you're not even playing against the best players

1831
03:09:15,780 --> 03:09:22,960
like you know okay if anyone's ever been on a team during
practice matches what they do is they put the main team as

1832
03:09:22,960 --> 03:09:29,200
like team a and then they're fighting against the b team so
you're not actually you're not even fighting like you're

1833
03:09:29,200 --> 03:09:29,720
like literally

1834
03:09:33,920 --> 03:09:40,320
during practice because you know you know they want you they
want the main team to have the chemistry yeah it's the good

1835
03:09:40,320 --> 03:09:47,180
players versus the bad players the subs so you're not even
the reserves so you're not even playing the actual good team

1836
03:09:47,180 --> 03:09:49,060
so it doesn't feel like good practice

1837
03:09:54,410 --> 03:10:00,710
so the only way so we did have like a practice school like
we do have a school that we would practice against sometimes

1838
03:10:00,710 --> 03:10:03,990
which was fun but that was the only time when practice was
fun like

1839
03:10:09,010 --> 03:10:21,970
bias yeah oh no but like okay but but in soccer in soccer um
in soccer it was the only sport that actually had good

1840
03:10:21,970 --> 03:10:30,750
practice in because they would put me as the goalkeeper of
the b team so you know so you know because the a team would

1841
03:10:30,750 --> 03:10:39,370
have more like i can have like more chances to like actually
like that they will put me on the B team so I can practice

1842
03:10:39,370 --> 03:10:47,610
against like the A team strikers because like I don't need
to be on the A team to practice against like I don't need to

1843
03:10:47,610 --> 03:10:55,810
be an A team to practice goalkeeping that's the only time I
got good practice and then I at one point okay for those who

1844
03:10:55,810 --> 03:11:08,430
didn't know I was like the most I my goalkeeping abilities
back then was so scary slash good i know you're like wow

1845
03:11:08,430 --> 03:11:15,870
doki so humble but no i i'm i'm really serious about this
because it's like i was really really good at goalkeeping to

1846
03:11:15,870 --> 03:11:27,410
the point where like the the male the boys team would ask me
to practice help in for their b team goalkeeper uh or for

1847
03:11:27,410 --> 03:11:36,030
their a team for their a team goalkeeping so they can have
like um so i can have more practice and also like Also,

1848
03:11:36,310 --> 03:11:41,970
like, they can have, like, a decent goalkeeper to practice
against with, too.

1849
03:11:45,650 --> 03:11:46,950
No, I didn't get kicked in the head there.

1850
03:11:46,990 --> 03:11:48,390
But it was really good practice as well.

1851
03:11:48,830 --> 03:11:55,250
I would, like, if the girls didn't have practice then, the
boys team would ask me to, like, the coaches and the boys

1852
03:11:55,250 --> 03:12:00,450
team would actually, would ask me to, like, be the
goalkeeper for the A team to help for practice.

1853
03:12:02,670 --> 03:12:03,370
Now look at me.

1854
03:12:03,410 --> 03:12:04,270
I sit at home.

1855
03:12:07,230 --> 03:12:13,470
I use my hand-eye coordination for gaming now for Marvel
rivals.

1856
03:12:19,190 --> 03:12:22,090
I use it for Marvel rivals now.

1857
03:12:25,450 --> 03:12:26,010

I mean, I'm fine with it, less running Because like they
would make me run Even though I was a goalkeeper

1869
03:12:55,710 --> 03:13:02,830
That's the worst part They would make me run Even though I
was the goalkeeper And I was like, well, you're gonna get a
