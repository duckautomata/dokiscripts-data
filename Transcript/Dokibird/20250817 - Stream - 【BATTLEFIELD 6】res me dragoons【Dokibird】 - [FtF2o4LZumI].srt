2
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:39,490
what do we not we don't okay let's put everything on high first and then we'll figure this out together i don't know what pcss means okay um okay is there any anti-aliased oh low oh every okay that's you know medium and low how about that okay i don't know what this means i don't i don't know what this means uh this means So,

3
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,530
uh, there's an auto, yeah, but auto settings don't really do much in general.

4
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,650
Okay, we don't need reflections.

5
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,790
What are we going to see?

6
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,110
Uh, medium.

7
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:49,790
Okay.

8
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,150
Okay, there we go.

9
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,950
I think, all right, yeah, take those graphics to the floor.

10
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,290
Okay.

11
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,430
All right, we got reset.

12
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:00,870
Okay.

13
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,650
Oh, shit.

14
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,430
Was this supposed to be 20,000?

15
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,410
That, that, that, that, I don't know if I actually was this supposed to be 20,000 for default.

16
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,750
I don't know Is this okay?

17
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,150
Is it I cuz I actually clicked lit?

18
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,490
Is this supposed to be 20,000?

19
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:29,210
I don't know I I don't remember God looks like really high

20
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,680
That looks really high.

21
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,400
Okay 20k is default.

22
00:05:39,860 --> 00:06:34,340
Okay, okay thank god okay i was gonna say like that looks absurdly high but if that's default then i i believe you guys all right um all right let's let's try this again before i give you guys life update let's figure this out let's figure out the the graphic situation for battlefield six um no okay what what the fuck is okay i have to figure out how to do secure boot but holy shit this game takes 20 years to boot up in general like i swear i have to wait like i feel like i'm waiting like like 20 years for this game to boot up um and like but yeah anyway i have to learn how to do secure boot do i turn that off after i uninstall battlefield today Do I,

23
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,120
just so I, no, like, I need a no.

24
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,180
Do I, oh my God, do I turn that off?

25
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm in a queue now.

26
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,120
No, but like, is it, okay, but like, is it good to turn it off?

27
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:05,680
Or is it, like, because like, I had to turn secure boot on, but after I'm done with today, Do I turn it off?

28
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,060
I'm like, I'm so confused.

29
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,160
Like, is secure boot even?

30
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,760
Oh, is secure boot good?

31
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,120
Oh, okay.

32
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,560
It's not, it was not on for me.

33
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,220
It was default wise, it was not on for me.

34
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,380
So that's why I was like so confused.

35
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,900
I was like, am I supposed to turn it off after, after I'm done with Battlefield?

36
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,580
Because I, I don't know.

37
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,220
Because I wasn't even on in the first place.

38
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,820
We keep it.

39
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,160
Okay.

40
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,820
All right.

41
00:07:33,840 --> 00:08:04,660
let's see oh i think that's fixed now all right we're good okay let me know if i got everything i need to do for graph okay is there anything i should turn on or turn off i don't play a lot of battlefield i always just play on launch and then we never revisit i feel like okay i feel like battlefield um and like and let's go to modern warfare they're all are like call of duty They're just like,

42
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,680
like, no, like, no, uh, no brain all aim type of game.

43
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,280
So you're just, you just want to turn off your brain and just shoot things.

44
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,980
Okay, never mind.

45
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,860
We gotta fix this.

46
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,140
Um, never mind.

47
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm still lagging.

48
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,960
Um, so like, so I usually just play it on launch and then like, and then like I don't come back after.

49
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:46,160
Uh, because like, even though it's like no brain type of game, like I just get my, I get my fix after well it's like i get my fix after like once or twice of playing uh of playing it uh it's just more so yeah um turn up texture quality but i'm lagging though

50
00:08:51,160 --> 00:09:57,680
i'm i'm i'm lagging though okay what are things can i do to uh to fix this doing okay I don't know maybe maybe it'll be different but usually uh I tend I I don't tend to play more than like once or twice for battlefield it just hasn't hooked me yet but I heard um I heard that it is really fun though for this iteration of battlefield um it's on borderless windows so the FPS shouldn't be that high that's the thing that's why I'm like why the fuck like am i like because i put on because apparently everyone was saying that uh you have to play on borderless window because of it i mean yeah so i don't know it's like all the other good battlefield games oh is vsync supposed to be off there you go vsync off i put it off um this sucks what else

51
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,720
It's already at 279 refresh rate.

52
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,240
Anti-graphics, advanced, anti-aliased, is there an advanced mode?

53
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,060
Oh, there it is.

54
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,240
Oh, there we go.

55
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,200
Or it's off.

56
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:19,780
Off.

57
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,620
Okay, there we go.

58
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,420
That's usually what causes it.

59
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:23,880
Okay.

60
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,100
Is there anything else?

61
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,060
Yeah, I have frame rate limiter.

62
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,560
Okay, we'll put it at 200.

63
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,420
Maybe that'll help.

64
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,060
What's this?

65
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,300
Oh, okay.

66
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:45,140
It's just a text message to remind me to make sure dad gets his, uh, dad renews his, uh, his vaccines.

67
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,900
Uh, all right.

68
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,320
Is that better now?

69
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,440
I think that's better.

70
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,240
Yeah?

71
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,160
All right.

72
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,420
Okay, dad update.

73
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,620
He's fully recovered.

74
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,400
Yeah!

75
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,000
And he's coming home today.

76
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:56,940
Yeah!

77
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:25,840
me he has fully recovered and uh he's back to his usual self now so um so that's really good news i'm really happy about that um but i do have to treat him more like a senior dog now because he's um he's too much of a long boy and because he's too much of a long boy he can't uh play fetch too intensely anymore um because he already has two incidents related to his disc issues so because,

78
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,980
you know, you know, like baseball terms, strike one, strike two, and strike three.

79
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,740
I'm already at two strikes now.

80
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
So I don't want to risk it.

81
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,480
I'm already at two strikes.

82
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,060
So I'm going to have to make sure he does not do too many strenuous activities.

83
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,080
So he's going to have to, I'm just going to have to roll the ball.

84
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,360
I don't want to risk it.

85
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,440
Okay, I think we fixed everything.

86
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:54,800
All right.

87
00:11:55,380 --> 00:13:12,140
yeah no i already said all the motion blur down um i think i think the genre is very fun um but for i i have played this i mean i did say i don't usually only play like once or twice but like sometimes i reinstall it if i do just want to play like uh uh you know head empty just aim type of game i do play play i have played it reinstalled and played it a couple of times um but i don't know i've never like i think it's because i didn't grow up with battlefield i never grew i didn't really grow up with battlefield slash uh call of duty type games my dad did and sometimes i would just play like i would watch him play it but um i didn't grow up with it oh yeah turn off you're right i feel like people are extra gamers uh you're right i should turn vc off i i forgot like people in this game are like extra gamers um so uh that's a good call um yeah i i'm not i will not be surprised if they are extra gamers today um but yeah no i'm i'm looking forward to i heard a lot of good things i heard a

88
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:48,180
lot of good things about battlefield so i am looking forward to trying it out um because when i played my first game today um i felt like i was really good and and i i was like oh my god look how gamer i am being not not that type of gamer but you know like actual you know what i mean but look how look at these shots i'm making and then i found out half my lobbies were bots um no i and then i saw the scoreboard and like half my love like like 50% of my lobby was just bots.

89
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,040
I think there was only, like, 15 real people in my lobby.

90
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,320
Like, it was only, like, 15 people that were real.

91
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,800
But I think it's because it was, like, my first game.

92
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,780
So, it was, like, there to, like, gauge, like, SPMM.

93
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,000
So, it was just to gauge my skill-wise, to put...

94
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,100
In order to put me in, like, whatever lobby I'm supposed to be in.

95
00:14:15,560 --> 00:15:15,540
that um for those who are wondering about my sink it fixed itself see guys procrastination is good it eventually fixed itself i didn't need to call a plumber um so yesterday i was like i'm gonna try one more time and then like um i reset my garbage disposal again and then it worked.

96
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:46,060
It did a little for full and um i was just like i'm like that's it i'm gonna i'm gonna try the garbage disposal one last time and then instantly all the water after like the garbage disposal work all the water instantly drained down um i was trying to cook co-okay guys co-okay so it fixed itself i don't have to call a plumber i didn't have to waste like 200 on a plumber guys i did it Well,

97
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:57,440
technically I didn't do anything, but because of my procrastination, I ended up saving myself $200 because I just did nothing.

98
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:57,800
I,

99
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:12,260
as long as I don't pour anything, as long as I only pour liquids down the sink, everything will be fine.

100
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,240
That's it.

101
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,420
I'll just never pour any type of food down the sink ever again.

102
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,460
And then I should be good.

103
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,500

114

116
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,620
Oh, that's why I was playing with bots.

117
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,460
Oh, that actually makes a lot more sense now.

118
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,060
Oh, that's why I had, like, only 15 real players.

119
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,280
Oh, you guys know I don't read.

120

You guys know that.

121
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,220
You know I don't read.

122
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,260
Where are you going to pre-ordered?

123
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,120
I don't know.

124
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,560
Tension.

125
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,780
Isn't like Battlefield super expensive?

126
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,300
It's like what?

127
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,580
How much is it, guys?

128
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I mean, I know like the early access you can play for free.

129
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,600
It's 70.

130
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,840
Oh my god, it's like one Mario Kart.

131
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,180
You know what?

132
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,200
No, it's like a Mario Kart game.

133
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,040
No, Mario Kart is even more expensive.

134
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,960
What am I saying?

135
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,740
What am I saying?

136
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,940
You're right, guys.

137
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,520
This game is pretty cheap.

138
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,720
This game...

139
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,480
You're right, guys.

140
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,820
This game is pretty cheap.

141
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,240
It's cheaper than Mario Kart.

142
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,910
Oh, my God.

143
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,270
We're going into war.

144
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,570
Alright, sound guy.

145
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,270
Hope you're ready.

146
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:18,990
Oh, shit.

147
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,810
I'm filling.

148
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,910
I'm scared.

149
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,270
Okay, we'll deploy here.

150
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,410
Oh my god, I feel like I'm already at war.

151
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,870
I literally heard.

152
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,510
Oh my god, wait, I literally...

153
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,710
Wait, medic.

154
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,790
Where's my medic?

155
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,730
No, he died in front of me.

156
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,130
It's okay.

157
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:41,970
Oh, shit.

158
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,490
No!

159
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,950
Bad down!

160
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,290
Bad down!

161
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,730
I'm fucking hurt!

162
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,050
Please!

163
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,470
Somebody, right?

164
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,270
I see you, Trevor!

165
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,650
Trevor, I see you!

166
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,490
Get me out!

167
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,830
I see, okay, there we go.

168
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:01,950
There we go.

169
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,270
I was not ready.

170
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,050
I need, like, a new gun.

171
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,970
I hate this gun.

172
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,910
I don't like this gun.

173
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,470
Hey, look.

174
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,290
Who is he shooting?

175
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:37,170
Oh my god suppressing fire Oh my okay That's just the smoke We're gonna fuck our people Suppressing fire I don't like this gun though This gun fucking sucks Wait did we get it?

176
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:47,910
I did it by doing nothing at all I love it I love when we capture Oh we're losing We're definitely losing Don't worry.

177
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,310
It's time to run.

178
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:50,710
Don't worry.

179
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,110
I'm gonna run in the open.

180
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,270
Don't worry, everybody.

181
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,090
I feel so safe.

182
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,750
I don't feel safe.

183
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,710
I don't feel safe.

184
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,070
I don't...

185
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,610
I don't...

186
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,530
It's okay.

187
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,630
Where's the medic?

188
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,530
Okay, get me out of here.

189
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,350
Get me...

190
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,310
I did not feel safe anymore.

191
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,010
It's okay.

192
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,010
This time, round two.

193
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,210
I figured this out.

194
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,210
Oh, he's sniping.

195
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:27,050
Wait, where are the people that I can see and, like, you know, shoot at?

196
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,390
Oh my god, there's so many things happening.

197
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,250
I'm so scared.

198
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,650
I feel like I shouldn't be in the open right now.

199
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,910
What I have learned is that I'm not a fan of my default gun.

200
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,950
I like stealing other people's guns for this.

201
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,710
I'm not a fan of this default gun.

202
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,410
How do I swap guns?

203
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:57,250
I don't know, like, battlefield it's, like, very similar to the other battlefields in terms of, like, gameplay.

204
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,530
But I always forget how to play battlefield other than shooting my gun.

205
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,670
Get in here.

206
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:05,890
That's right.

207
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,770
Wait.

208
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,390
I can't do anything in here.

209
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:10,910
Or, don't worry.

210
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,970
I'm up here now.

211
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,150
That's right.

212
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,890
Where am I going?

213
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,050
Where am I?

214
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,290
All right, this way.

215
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,710
I'm heading over.

216
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,170
Are you serious?

217
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,510
I...

218
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,570
I can't do anything!

219
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,690
Ideally, I look over, I look over and time to kill.

220
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,350
God.

221
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,390
Time to kill is already God.

222
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,650
Every time!

223
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,410
Where is my time to kill?

224
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,470
Round three.

225
00:22:48,290 --> 00:23:42,570

Oh my god.

227
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,350
I feel like I'm actually in war.

228
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,190
I'm so cautious right now after that.

229
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,450
Oh, two is healed.

230
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,130
Two is healed.

231
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:55,990
Okay, that's fine.

232
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,070
Oh my god.

233
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,630
Oh my god.

234
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,410
Okay, it's fine.

235
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,370
Everything is fine.

236
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,050
Everything is okay.

237
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,250
I'll follow my crew.

238
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,590
Hello, everybody.

239
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,890
Oh!

240
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,570
Shit!

241
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,990
Okay, maybe I should have been in the open.

242
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,410
Where's my team?

243
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,530
Please!

244
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:15,930
Please!

245
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,470
I can still feel my legs!

246
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,140
I still feel my legs, John!

247
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,960
Get off!

248
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,410
John!

249
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,170
No!

250
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,930
It's okay.

251
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,590
That's okay.

252
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,330
I see him.

253
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,090
The fapping.

254
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,430
It's still...

255
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,790
My legs are still attached to me!

256
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:40,950
Please!

257
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,990
He doesn't care.

258
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,050
Please, save me.

259
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,130
I've had it.

260
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,030
Okay, it's fine.

261
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,910
It's fine, it's fine.

262
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,050
I'm here again.

263
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,270
Round four.

264
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,350
I'll figure this out with group fours.

265
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:04,930
There we go.

266
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,650
That's how I felt when I was playing.

267
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,230
Okay.

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:43,300

You're a coward, Don.

271
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,560
I hope you die in the field.

272
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,220
You fucking coward.

273
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:50,840
Wait.

274
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,620
I hope you never see your wife again.

275
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,110
Fuck you.

276
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,040
Fuck you.

277
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,020
There's a freaking thing.

278
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,820
And he's supposed to be a hero.

279
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,340
What happened?

280
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,760
No fucking shit we're losing.

281
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,680
Did you not see what Don did?

282
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:30,400
He let me die Jesus fucking Christ Oh my god It's fine

283
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:44,200
It's fine Oh God Oh my god Kappa!

Please!

286
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,460

287
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,580
I'm right here!

288
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,220
Please, I have a wife and kid!

289
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,760
Oh my god, everyone's a coward.

290
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,160
Everyone's a fucking...

291
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,760
That's it.

292
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,520
Get me... That's it.

293
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,520
How do I swap my shit to get my class?

294
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,080
That's it.

295
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,580
It's time to be a sniper.

296
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,740
We're good.

297
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,100
If we're gonna lose.

298
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,280
What the fuck?

299
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,780
How do you spot in front of me?

300
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:27,520
How?

301
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,340
Why is he just there?

302
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,960
I thought that was like my team for some reason.

303
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,500
I was like, how is he in front of me?

304
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,860
I don't...

305
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,660
I was like, oh shit, that's my teammate, right?

306
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,140
It was not my teammate.

307
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
It was actually not.

308
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,420
Are you serious?

309
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,380
Holy shit.

310
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,180

00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,230
I'm one shot.

330
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,430
I'm actually one shot.

331
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,150
Oh, like, where's the footsteps?

332
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,640
Where the fuck is the...

333
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,360
Where's ATS here?

334
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,300
Why are they even in our base?

335
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,700
It's not even safe.

336
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,680
I thought being here would...

337
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,380
I would be safe, but...

338
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,180
Wait, did I not kill him?

339
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,440
That felt like a shot right there.

340
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,320
I don't know.

341
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,900
Is there like...

342
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:41,060
fall off is it not like accurate that should i thought that would hit there we go fucking finally okay i was like i was like how is that not hitting i was so confused oh there's bullet drop okay okay that makes more sense i was like i was like that that's literally on his head

343
00:30:45,920 --> 00:31:24,600
head how is that not hitting like actually i hit oh my god you you it's okay it's okay please oh it's not okay he's dead that's it sniper's do do i hate sniper all right that's it i'm going back what's engineer assault i'm going back I'm going back to front line if they're just gonna be here Oh it's okay I just lost

344
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:48,860
All right That's not my fault my squad My the word my on my side We actually draft the children We have actual children playing That's not That's not on me.

345
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,120
We have, like, actual kids that join the army.

346
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:59,880
They lowered the age limit for this war on our side.

347
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,240
We were out of men.

348
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,520
Also, like, we got to fix our...

349
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,060
Let's see.

350
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,580
Alright, we were lagging a little bit.

351
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,160
Like, not in the game, but, like, me in general.

352
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,020
But I feel like I already set everything as low as it could go.

353
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,460
Like, I can't go any lower, guys.

354
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,500
That's the thing.

355
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,620
I can't go any lower.

356
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,800
I've set it as low as it could go.

357
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,740
Is there anything else I could do to fix it?

358
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,100
144?

359
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,220
Okay.

360
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,480
144.

361
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,500
Where is that?

362
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,580
Where is the advanced settings?

363
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,380
I'll do it 144 and see if that helps.

364
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,080
I'll do 170, actually.

365
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,440
170.

366
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,620
Oh, film grain.

367
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,680
Would film grain really affect that?

368
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,940
I hate when you get out of...

369
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,400
Oh my gosh.

370
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,820
I hate when you get out of settings.

371
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,560
It goes back to, like, the default film and bloom off.

372
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,380
Okay.

373
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,460
Yeah, it's very...

374
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,500
Wait, what FOV should I do?

375
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,280
What FOV should I do, guys?

376
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,260
Okay, I saw it.

377
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,560
The female snatcher.

378
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,500
Good name.

379
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,080
Good.

380
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,160
90 is fine.

381
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,140
Okay, let's look through our...

382
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,240
Our FOV.

383
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,080
I'll do 100.

384
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,960
Okay, 100.

385
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,120
Film grain.

386
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,280
Okay, I'll do that off.

387
00:33:48,300 --> 00:35:17,330
and see if that helps and then all right is everything good uh okay see it's a little yeah it's still a little choppy chroma okay after we die actually actually I can stand here okay chrome what the okay all right so it's an improvement there's a guy right here but he's dead i think okay he's dead for real maybe he has a gun i like it's a sniper oh wait no no i actually like this gun what gun is this i actually really like this gun what gun is this that i'm holding yeah it's a little better now not but it is a little better there's so many people getting shot where's Charlie who the fuck is Charlie I don't know him that well oh shit okay oh that was it was a tank it was it was it was a tank because I think I found Charlie I think I

388
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,410
Okay, I figured out who Charlie was.

389
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,290
How do I...

390
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,170
I like that gun.

391
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,110
That gun I was holding earlier when I was, like, uh, practicing.

392
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,590
Uh, playing my...

393
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,370

398
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,470
How?

399
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,650
I literally just got here.

400
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,410
How does he have so many tanks?

I'm sorry.

407
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,050
I clicked it and then a bullet didn't come out.

408
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,350
I was so confused.

409
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,370
I was like, where did my bullet go?

410
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,050
But now I don't...

411
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,470
Don't worry.

412
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,690
I'm worrying.

413
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,830
I don't think he knows I'm right here.

414
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,730
Okay, nice.

415
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,070
I knew he didn't know.

416
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,090
Don't worry.

417
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,730
Oh my god, I didn't want your gun.

418
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,790

419
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,110
Oh, shit.

00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,550
Alright, now I have his gun.

421
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,890

422
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,110

I'm so scared.

425
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,930
Where am I?

426
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,790
I'm uncovered.

427
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,810
Okay, I feel more safe here.

428
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,790
Let me run in the open a little bit.

429
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,510

No!

450
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,070
He had to be so low.

451
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,010
Oh my god.

452
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,670
He had to be so low too.

453
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,970
That's the worst part.

454
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,350
I thought he was incredible.

455
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,490
Yeah, I had to be low.

456
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,090
Okay.

457
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:33,890

466
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,580
I got it and I...

467
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,080
I died?

468
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm gonna figure this out if it's the last thing that kills me.

469
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,020
I'll figure this out.

470
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,940
He doesn't know.

471
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,000
But worry, boys.

472
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,380

That's our car.

481
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,060
Okay, he doesn't know how to drive.

482
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,680
It's okay.

483
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,520
Team play.

484
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,080
I got you.

485
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,660

00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,060
I was promised a line of reses.

489
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,640
I was lied to.

490
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,640
I haven't got...

491
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,580
I swear to God, I feel like I haven't got resed even once in this game.

492
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,360
I...

493
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,560
Calling for help.

494
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,680
Well, I'm just alone in this cruel world.

495
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,140
Okay.

496
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,260
Here we go.

497
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,060
What makes this battlefield better than the other battlefield?

498
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:54,360
for me like I feel like it it all feels this very similar to me but I think it's because I didn't grow up with battlefield so I can't tell like what makes it different from the other battlefields don't talk eat dog world no sweaty oh so there's no movement in this like those like was it neo strafing and shit like that's right it's shot in the back bitch Wait,

499
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,320
there's a person here.

500
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,800
No, that's my teammate.

501
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,120
Oh, they're...

502
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,440
Just pure chaos?

503
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,660
Oh, I can...

504
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,320
Okay, I can tell why people like that.

505
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,100
It is definitely very...

506
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,740
Oh my god, I didn't like this gun.

507
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,240
That gun fucking sucked.

508
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,100
That...

509
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,600
That gun was terrible.

510
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,180

511
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,300

512
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,220

513
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,560

514
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,080

00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,460
He's so dead.

517
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,380

518
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,600
He's gonna get chased.

519
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,660

520
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,720

00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,760
While running towards people?

559
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:24,580
Can you hold it?

560
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,790
It's like a little suicide bomb.

561
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,840
It was worth it.

562
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,220

563
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,420

564
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,800

565
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,520
It was worth it.

566
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,720

569
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,440
It was so worth it.

570
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,820
It was so funny.

571
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,860

572
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,600
Don't worry, I got you.

573
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,840
I'm a medic.

574
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,660
I don't have a doctorate, but don't worry.

575
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,960
I learned on YouTube.

576
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:40,540
I got my degree on online university.

577
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,020
Don't have to worry.

578
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,880
I used ChatGPD to teach me how to do the doctor things.

579
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,300
I watched a lot of search.

580
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:58,660
Stop!

581
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,380
Where am I?

582
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,360
How the fuck?

583
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,700
How did I get here?

584
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,200
How the fuck?

585
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,780
How did I get here?

586
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,000
Female snatcher!

587
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,040
Time to snatch the female!

588
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,200
There we go.

589
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,860
He's snatching me, guys!

590
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,060
He sn- I got snatched!

591
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,200
How did I get here?

592
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,280
I don't know.

593
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:29,500
Oh, hey.

594
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,120
Don't worry, I got you.

595
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,200
I like ran past him like three times.

596
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:39,140
I actually ran past that guy like...

597
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,380
I don't like this gun.

598
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,400
It feels weird to aim with.

599
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,180
I know like I missed a lot of shots, but like it still feels really weird.

600
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,900
You almost let him die.

601
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,440
I didn't know.

602
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,340
It's different.

603
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,460
It's called ignorance.

604
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,940
I didn't mean to let him die.

605
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,980
I was just ignorant.

606
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,060
That's different.

607
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,260
Oh my god!

608
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:11,780
Whoa!

609
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:12,640
What?

610
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,800
There were dates!

611
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,700
Female snatcher!

612
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,660
It's time to snatch another female!

613
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,140
Snatch me up!

614
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,140
Nice.

615
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,960
Got snatched.

616
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,960
Snatched again.

617
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,300
He lives up to his name.

618
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,420
What can I say?

619
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,240
He's out here snatching the females.

620
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,420
Don't worry.

621
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,800
Oh, he's dead.

622
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,360
I got you!

623
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:46,940
Okay.

624
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,620
Oh my god, there's so many bodies over there.

625
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,840
There's so many bodies over there.

626
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,660
I need to not reload.

627
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,440
Oh, we did it.

628
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,180
I did it.

629
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,420
I did it.

630
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,340
I can run in.

631
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,600
I'm not using.

632
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,380
Look, the DPIP is only for killing.

633
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,240
Not for resing.

634
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,100
Look at me go.

635
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,800
I did it, guys.

636
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,360
I'm still figuring stuff out.

637
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,320

00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,580
Like, okay, quit to menu.

647
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah, this is, it's not intuitive at all.

648
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,660
I feel so fucking stupid trying to figure this out.

Oh, wait, I do.

655
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,750
I don't know what that did.

656
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,190
But I attached something.

657
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,860
I don't know what I did.

658
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,080
I attached something, though.

659
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,120

660
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:32,840

Okay.

663
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,060
I like this sight.

664
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,640
This is...

665
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,680
Iron sight, right?

666
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,200
This looks like iron.

667
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,840
I hate that.

668
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,960
I like this one more.

669
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,080
Yeah.

670
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,900
Am I good?

671
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,030
Holy shit.

672
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,250
The recoil is crazy.

673
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,350
That recoil is fucking crazy.

674
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:08,350
The spread?

675
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:09,650
Like, look at that spread!

676
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,530
Jesus Christ.

677
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,110
I'm trying to like...

678
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,430
pull it down.

679
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:24,210
Like, it's easier in close range, that's for sure.

680
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:24,810
Yeah.

681
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,110
Oh, you tap fire?

682
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:29,710
Oh, okay.

683
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,890
Okay, you tap fire.

684
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:34,270
Okay.

685
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,390
I mean, I can hold it for...

686
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,070
I'll hold it for close range.

687
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,190
And then far, I'll tap it.

688
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,970
I'll tap for far, then.

689
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:46,390
Okay.

690
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,530
I hold for carbine.

691
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,450
I don't tap for...

692
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:52,310
I don't...

693
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,910
I mean, I don't tap for carbine in Apex.

694
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:57,130
Okay.

695
00:53:58,930 --> 00:53:59,970
If I...

696
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,330
Oh my god, I'm never hip-firing.

697
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:02,770
I...

698
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,110
I'm never hip-firing.

699
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:04,950
Now I know.

700
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,410
That's why it's like...

701
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:07,990
How did I...

702
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:11,270
When I, like, hip-fire that guy up close, I was so confused.

703
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:12,350
I'm...

704
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,150
Yeah, I'm...

705
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,630
I'm never doing that.

706
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,110
Uh...

707
00:54:18,890 --> 00:55:15,310
yeah now i know now i know hipfire is hipfire bad all right uh okay what else is fun what else should we try guys which one other than conquest unless conquest is the only good one unless which one is also fun all that warfare is fun i felt like i already was in a war like how could it get worse how how how could it get worse i feel like i was i felt like i was definitely in a war just then um conquest is the the battlefield game mode okay so where's this what's the difference between

708
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,370
Oh no, it's Rush.

709
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:22,130
Rush B.

710
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,690
Oh my god.

711
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:28,410
I thought that was my teammate at first, so I didn't care.

712
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:30,170
Please!

713
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,370
I'm right here!

714
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:33,750
Oh.

715
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:35,270
Okay.

716
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,570
Oh, that's what you deserve that, you fucking bitch.

717
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,750
You fucking deserve that.

718
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,550
Yeah, this is still a conquest, isn't it?

719
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,690
I thought I queued up war.

720
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,320
I got you.

721
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:57,800
That's right.

722
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,760
I got you.

723
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,240
Give me those stat points.

724
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,900
Oh my god, I'm ignoring.

725
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,320
I didn't see that guy that died in front of me.

726
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,400
I didn't know.

727
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,040
What the fuck happened?

728
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,600
Oh,

729
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:18,460

730
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,660
No, oh my god, there was a medic behind me.

731
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:22,620
Not right.

732
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:55,380

734
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:04,620
If we're all medics, if we're all medics, we can all just revive each other and everything.

735
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:05,660
Okay.

765
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,810
I swear to God, I saw this man.

766
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,640
Oh my god.

767
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,760
Where are they?

768
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,600
Where are they?

769
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,200
Ow, I broke my legs, but that's okay, I'm a medic.

770
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,680
Don't worry, I'm holding it.

771
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,250
Don't worry, I'm holding it.

Come on.

775
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,190
Come on.

776
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,410
Surely someone will just walk up to me.

777
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:24,910
You're all in the way.

778
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:25,290
Don't.

779
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:27,170
No, no, no, no.

780
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:28,930
Hey.

781
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,000
It was worth it.

782
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,320
It was worth it.

783
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,720
That guy.

784
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,380
It was worth it.

785
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,360
I knew it.

786
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,260
I knew someone will eventually.

787
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,360
come over.

788
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,460
We take those.

789
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:06,320
If I didn't, if I didn't leave, if I didn't achieve my defib, I could have got a second kill.

790
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,520
That was the...

791
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,360
I actually, I actually could have killed another guy if I didn't achieve the defib.

792
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,060
Oh my god!

793
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,220
Get me out of here.

794
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,400
Get me out of here.

795
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,320
My team can handle it.

796
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,420
To be fair, he was sort of asking for it.

797
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,000
He literally ran past me.

798
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,920
He didn't look at the map.

799
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:31,680
That's his fault.

800
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,900
He could have looked at the map and saw me.

801
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,240
I was not.

802
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,980
I was not being shy about it.

803
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,320
Maybe?

804
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:45,760
Hello?

805
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,240

807
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,640

01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:51,260

Oh my god, I thought I should have held.

813
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,700

I won't.

820
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,520
I refuse to die.

821
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,280
I... Okay, maybe I'm gonna go die.

822
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,080
Maybe I...

823
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:56,360

Wait, how do I...

826
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,960
How do I swap?

827
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:02,880
Oh, here you go.

828
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:03,400
Engineer.

829
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,100
What do I get?

830
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,800
Oh!

831
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,640
I get a frag grenade.

832
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,260
Oh!

833
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,600
Oh, I get that!

834
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,420
I get an RPG.

835
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,680
That's cool.

836
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,040
I've died to a lot of these.

837
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,020
My turn.

838
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,220
Wait, they live?

839
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:28,200
What?

840
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,560
How did they all just live?

841
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,060
Wait, that's...

842
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,180
Wait, what?

843
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,480
Does it not kill them?

844
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,120
How did they just live?

845
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,090
It's an RPG.

846
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:52,250
It's...

847
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,210
It doesn't...

848
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,330
It's a fucking RPG!

849
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:58,450
What the fuck do you mean?

850
01:04:58,570 --> 01:04:59,350
That is not real.

851
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:00,230
There's no way.

852
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:07,570
If I fucking, if I explode something on your fucking face, I better, like, see some, like, body parts.

853
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,470
Like, like, this is, that's it.

854
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:13,530
Not realistic enough.

855
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:18,650
I'm, like, I better see some fucking body parts exploding.

856
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,890
You gotta be accurate.

857
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:24,890

If I defibrillate you, you will die from a heart attack.

872
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,860
How is that any less realistic?

873

905
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,690
I'm actually a hero.

906
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,670

01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,670

01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:36,870
I got him though.

912
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:38,270
I got him.

913
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:39,030
It's okay.

914
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:40,170
I got him.

915
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:45,050
Did you see me crouch him?

916
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,770
I crouched so I could kill him while in prone form.

917
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:55,830
He tried to prone and I fucking killed him while he was proning.

918
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,910
Oh my god.

919
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:29,390

This house is perfect.

926
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:00,860
It's all like close quarters It's all close quarters

927
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:21,420
From me This is actually like the best place for a deep bib.

928
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:30,180
I I just wait with my deep bib and I just Hippocratic...

929
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:33,240
There's no Hippocratic Oath in War.

930
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,680
There's no...

931
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,680
I'm already...

932
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,720
Back into the city I go.

933
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,960
There's no Hippocratic Oath in War.

934
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:45,980
Soldier.

935
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,680
It's all...

936
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,180
It's a defensive world out here.

937
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:56,580
Okay, he's a teammate.

938
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,840
I was ready.

939
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,040
I was ready to defib.

940
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,560
I was so ready.

941
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,200
I can't believe that was my best run.

942
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,020
Goodbye.

943
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,620
Goodbye.

944
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,700
I just think I want to leave here.

945
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,720
I don't want to leave this house.

946
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,380
It's a defib world out here.

947
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,320
He was dropping apple.

948
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,740

I did it.

953
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,420
The doctor did it.

954
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,660
Don't worry.

955
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:49,620
I'm a doctor.

956
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,540
These aren't for you.

957
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,200
Maybe for you.

958
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,540

01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,400

963
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,860
I was trying to serpentine him.

964
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,860
I wanted to serpentine him.

965
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:21,020
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,060
Welcome to the doctor's office.

The doctor is in.

977
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,640

01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,360
place to be in.

981
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,240
Like, they just don't expect it.

982
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,640
There's so many close quarters.

983
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,380
They don't expect a doctor to be here.

984
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,400
Imagine seeing this from the enemy POV.

985
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,060
That's the best part.

986
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,220
This is where I killed the man.

987
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,080

01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,210

01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:13,270
Actually looked away because I thought I killed him.

1041
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:20,610
You know, like, those moments when you feel like...

1042
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:23,690
You did enough damage, but you didn't do enough damage.

1043
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:24,650
That's how I felt.

1044
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,310
Oh my god, that poor man.

1045
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:27,750
Oh, he's triple dead.

1046
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:29,930
Yeah, I don't think he's gonna live.

1047
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:31,910
Don't worry.

1048
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:32,490
Ah!

1049
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:33,230
Worry.

1050
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:33,970
It's okay.

1051
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:35,910
There's 20 of us that are medics.

1052
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,690
There's so many of us.

1053
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,750
It's okay.

1054
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:40,530
One of them.

1055
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:42,150
One of them can do it.

1056
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,130
There's one guy.

1057
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,190
Bro, I...

1058
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:46,370
Bro, I'm...

1059
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:46,890
Stop!

1060
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:49,610
Please, sir.

1061
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:50,830
I can't...

1062
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:55,090
I can't, excuse me, sir, okay, he is definitely brain-rodded.

1063
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,750
He is definitely brain-rodded.

1064
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:01,110
There's no questions about it.

1065
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:06,670
He's definitely, he's definitely not here for war.

1066
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:10,670
Don't worry.

1067
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:11,950
Clear!

1068
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:18,530
I'm like, I feel like I'm just stuck here.

1069
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:21,230
There's like no way to move anywhere else.

1070
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,310
I feel like we're just stuck here for the rest of our lives.

1071
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:27,010
Oh, shit.

1072
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:29,730
Oh, my God.

1073
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:31,390
Don't worry.

1074
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,390
Clear.

1075
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,840
I need a defensive assault rifle.

1076
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,260
I'm too scared to move out.

1077
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,760
There's so many people just shooting.

1078
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,860
I'm so scared.

1079
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:48,680
Clear.

1080
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:56,410
Oh, my God.

1081
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:57,130
I did it.

1082
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,860
Oh my god.

1083
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,600
No, it's a brain rot, man.

1084
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,040
It's a brain rot, man.

1085
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,340
My only savior.

1086
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:15,240
Oh my god, wait.

1087
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:16,140
It's this guy.

1088
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:16,800
Sewer gym.

1089
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,020
Sewer gym.

1090
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,720
Sewer gym.

1091
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:21,160
You have a defib.

1092
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,440
Sewer gym.

1093
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:26,640
Drop.

1094
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:30,700
Wait, I have a medkit all this time.

1095
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,660
I have a medkit.

1096
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,560
Oh my god, all this time.

1097
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,480
I've had a method and I never knew.

1098
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:38,120
I never knew.

1099
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:39,720
Look at that.

1100
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,360
It's my middle heels.

1101
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:42,560
It's gone.

1102
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:45,500
It's already gone.

1103
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,520
I didn't know.

1104
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:51,860
Oh my god.

1105
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,420
Oh my.

1106
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,140
Yeah, no.

1107
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,480
I was not living that.

1108
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,880
I was not living.

1109
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:01,660
I.

1110
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:04,560
Yeah, that was a hopeless mission.

1111
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,060
right there.

1112
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:09,860
Alright.

1113
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,120
I don't think we're winning this, guys.

1114
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,220
This looks not promising.

1115
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,620
Can you look at previous scoreboards?

1116
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:20,920
Or, like, are they gone, gone?

1117
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:22,920
Oh my god.

1118
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:25,840
Go again.

1119
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,200
Get back in there.

1120
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,920
I don't think they know I can come over from here.

1121
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:41,540
oh my god oh my god

1122
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,980
you'll never know

1123
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:43,000
oh my god it was it was so with it it was so

1124
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:06,250
Oh yeah, I think I'd like Battlefield 6 guys.

1125
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:10,890
I think I think I should like this game.

1126
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:14,970
I think I like Battlefield 6.

1127
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:20,670
I live by the Thief Fib, die by the Thief Fib.

1128
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:26,830
the bush message that is so rat like

1129
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:49,540
i think that's the best thing they've ever added to this game that honestly those guys did not have holy holy shit i was like oh my god like happened to you

1130
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:31,800
the deep the the the deep fib used to kill though that's the thing the deep fib used to kill before that's the thing that's what makes it better oh they did I don't know about you but oh my god oh how did I thought oh my god I actually I John Wick shit.

1131
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:35,620
That was some actual John Wick shit.

1132
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:39,560
I climbed over it just in time.

1133
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,320
That's crazy.

1134
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:46,320
I actually climbed over just in time and not died by that.

1135
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,760
Oh my god.

1136
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:52,460
That's insane.

1137
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,160
I can't believe.

1138
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,020
Don't worry!

1139
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,860
Got you.

1140
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,220
Don't worry!

1141
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:02,220
Clear!

1142
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:03,440
Let's go!

1143
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,100
Oh my god, okay, not clear.

1144
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:07,980
Not clear.

1145
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:12,860
Don't you wick in the flesh.

1146
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:14,980
Clip it, guys.

1147
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:15,820
Clip it.

1148
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,560
I don't think we're winning this, guys.

1149
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:21,340
I don't- I think this war is over for us.

1150
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,080
This war is my mayor.

1151
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:26,960
Don't worry, guys.

1152
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:27,740
I got you.

1153
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,900
I got you all.

1154
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:36,560
I like how I threw down the heels and none of them, every- all of them walked away from it.

1155
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:39,800
That's what I like to see.

1156
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,860
Don't worry, I'm here for you.

1157
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,820
It's a guaranteed kill.

1158
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:07,040
I don't- I only- I do it for the guaranteed kill.

1159
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:19,510
if they get close enough oh i see him i see him

1160
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:28,150
almost got it if i did oh he was

1161
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:34,290
finally fully charged i would have

1162
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:56,390
got it i knew he was gonna rush i heard him he was so low i i was ready don't worry okay he ran away I don't wait.

1163
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:58,830
I guess we worry.

1164
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,230
I guess.

1165
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:02,330
Oh my god.

1166
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:02,850
Jesus.

1167
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:03,330
Chill.

1168
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:08,510
I missed my house.

1169
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:10,670
Wait, can I...

1170
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:12,430
Can I charge it up and store it?

1171
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:13,310
Is that possible?

1172
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,950
Is that actually possible, guys?

1173
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:18,550
Holy shit.

1174
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:20,770
Chill.

1175
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,010
Yeah, chill.

1176
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:27,390
Yeah, guys, we're not winning this war, guys.

1177
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:30,510
As soon as I lost my house, we were never gonna win.

1178
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:32,890
The house was, like, the key.

1179
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:35,330
I

1180
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,180
almost got him!

1181
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,580
I wanted to be him!

1182
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:45,370
No!

1183
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:47,890
If I didn't be him, I...

1184
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:48,810
Oh, my God.

1185
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:51,310
I wanted to be him so bad.

1186
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:56,830
Okay, that was my bad.

1187
01:29:57,050 --> 01:30:00,330
If I didn't be him, we would have actually won that fight.

1188
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:01,250
Let me see.

1189
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:02,310
I got greedy.

1190
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:04,110
I got so greedy.

1191
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:06,070
I was like, I'm gonna...

1192
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:11,590
I was like, I'm gonna defib him.

1193
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:15,750
The heart wants what the heart wants.

1194
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:20,130
I fumbled the squad wipe.

1195
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,660
Jesus Christ, I saw a paratrooper right there.

1196
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,840
The heart wanted what it couldn't get.

1197
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:34,840
I'm so sad.

1198
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,900
Oh my god, that's a tank.

1199
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:39,540
Does anybody know?

1200
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,780
Oh my god, dude.

1201
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:49,760
Okay.

1202
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:53,280
Oh my god.

1203
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,120
Holy shit.

1204
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:00,660
Oh!

1205
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,100
What the fuck?

1206
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:13,430
I'm like, what the fuck is- They're all up there!

1207
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:41,150
the one time i had to shoot what a streak though wait she's guys i'm not just a defibrant guys i can also shoot my gun i don't guys i don't it seemed like the reason i was defibrating was because it seemed like i couldn't aim but in fact it was just funnier it was funnier to kill

1208
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:47,490
I did it because it was funny.

1209
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,990
I...

1210
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:55,170
Yeah, sometimes you shoot a little null.

1211
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:59,230
I talked to you with my gun.

1212
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:01,750
Oh!

1213
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:02,510
Are you...

1214
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:03,370
Are you fucker?

1215
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:05,390
You actual fucker.

1216
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:07,190
Do we lose?

1217
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:08,150
What happened?

1218
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:12,450
I was like, did I just go to like double hell or some shit?

1219
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:13,990
What the fuck happened to me?

1220
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:16,230
You're not right.

1221
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:16,890
It is funny.

1222
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:20,330
It is so much funnier.

1223
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:26,510
It is a lot funnier.

1224
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:31,550
Oh.

1225
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:34,990
Oh, he was one.

1226
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:37,250
He was one.

1227
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:38,770
That's so unlucky.

1228
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,030
Wait, I think Nola can pick me up.

1229
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:42,730
Don't worry.

1230
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:43,470
Don't worry.

1231
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:44,030
I got you.

1232
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:44,950
I can cover you.

1233
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:46,810
Don't let him RPG you.

1234
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:48,330
Don't let him RPG you, doll!

1235
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:53,330
Okay, that's close.

1236
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:54,730
Nice.

1237
01:32:56,150 --> 01:32:57,410
Don't worry, we got this.

1238
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:58,410
You and I.

1239
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:03,890
I did say you and I.

1240
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:11,330
Maybe we don't got this, but you and I, we died to get there.

1241
01:33:11,490 --> 01:33:12,930
That's all that matters.

1242
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:14,650
You and I.

1243
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:18,070
Not this time.

1244
01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:25,250
Jesus Christ, what the fuck it be?

1245
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:29,950
Eh.

1246
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:33,710
Oh shit, what gun?

1247
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:35,030
Oh my god, he headshot me.

1248
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:37,370
What gun was that?

1249
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:38,530
Oh, we lost.

1250
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:39,070
It's okay.

1251
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:40,950
I died before I knew.

1252
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:41,770
We lost.

1253
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,210
So I'll never know.

1254
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,670
It's like the people that died before they lost the war.

1255
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:51,150
never know they lost the war they thought they died for so the war could be won

1256
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:04,460

1259
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,500
Provides at the cost of felt recoil.

1260
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:24,020
What?

1261
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,060
Improved bullet?

1262
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,280
Is this for...

1263
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,000
For armor?

1264
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,420
Like, what does this mean?

1265
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:37,220
When it comes to shooting?

1266
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:44,170
Are you gonna shoot through people?

1267
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,550
Okay, give me that shit.

1268
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:47,270
What the fuck cares about recoil?

1269
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:48,850
I can control that.

1270
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:51,050
What's this?

1271
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:52,310
What the fuck would use this?

1272
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:52,630
I feel like...

1273
01:35:52,650 --> 01:36:07,850
this is better for iron sight what's my top accessory oh fuck it let them see me but try this all right was i i played conquest right

1274
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:24,490
um okay let's do close quarters i think this is the best for tfib i hear close quarters That seems like defib territory.

1275
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:29,710
That...

1276
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:30,470
Oh, shit.

1277
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:31,270
I can upgrade.

1278
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,890
Okay, wait.

1279
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:33,450
Wait, cancel.

1280
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:37,110
What do you mean I can upgrade the defib?

1281
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:39,730
No, I can't.

1282
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:40,470
You liars.

1283
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:44,570
No, I can't.

1284
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:47,910
I was going to be so happy.

1285
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:49,110
I wish you could.

1286
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:51,690
You should be able to mod the defib.

1287
01:36:52,930 --> 01:36:57,110
Oh, yeah, by the way, by the way, uh, Shady, thank you for the Aka soup.

1288
01:36:57,290 --> 01:37:10,250
Sorry, that was when I was in my, like, reign of terror when I was reacting to Shady, thank you for the Aka soup, but thank you, thank you, Jokie, bringing in the shock and awe.

1289
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:14,470
That was when I was filled with power.

1290
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:21,170
Less room, less rigor, bigger hitboxer than D5.

1291
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:53,310
the fort make my defib a sniper like instead of shooting bullets we shoot out many defib litigators and if it hits you you just instantly die like the goal was it the golden gun um like the one shot one kill all right oh yeah an aoe effect it's not a fib with a scope my defib ammo instead of sniper ammo.

1292
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:54,530
I want defib ammo.

1293
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:57,450
There's no one play... Oh, I was going to say, no one plays close quarters.

1294
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:06,730
Alright.

1295
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:08,290
Oh my god.

1296
01:38:08,890 --> 01:38:10,430
This is my territory.

1297
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:15,830
The doctor is in.

1298
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:22,070
No!

1299
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:24,530
I should have charged it.

1300
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:26,130
I didn't charge it.

1301
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:27,170
It's okay.

1302
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:27,810
It's okay.

1303
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:28,470
I know now.

1304
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:29,690
Yeah, I know.

1305
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:31,290
I wasn't charging it.

1306
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:39,490
I learned.

1307
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:42,370
I learned from my mistakes.

1308
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:44,770
The doctor is out.

1309
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:49,590
Don't worry.

1310
01:38:50,050 --> 01:38:52,250
The doctor is in.

1311
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,220
Holy shit.

1312
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,260
I just...

1313
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:03,620
Holy shit.

1314
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,080
What was it?

1315
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:05,180
What was it?

1316
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:10,400
Shit, I just hear, I just hear shots everywhere.

1317
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:14,580
Oh, shit.

1318
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,560

1319
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:16,200
I wait!

1320
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:17,200
It's okay.

1321
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:18,100
It's okay.

1322
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:27,700
It's fucking worth it.

1323
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I, okay, I'll use my gun now.

1324
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:32,580
I'll use my gun now.

1325
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:34,160
I'll actually pay attention.

1326
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,380
I had to try, I like to test it out, you know.

1327
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,380
What the fuck?

1328
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:44,700
Okay.

1329
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:48,860
You know, I had to test my theory out in this area.

1330
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:49,720
You know?

1331
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,720
Okay, that's my teammate.

1332
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,380
No gun, only DFIP.

1333
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,060
DFIP run.

1334
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:06,400
It's a DFIP world.

1335
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,860
I'll make sure nobody tries to thank us here.

1336
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:15,300
Nice.

1337
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:33,840

01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:01,980
I- I thought I had a teammate with me!

1341
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:03,700
He was just gone!

1342
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,760
Okay, I know that...

1343
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:13,100

1344
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:14,120
Can he hear when you're crouch?

1345
01:41:23,730 --> 01:41:26,010
I'm gonna wait until this guy comes over.

1346
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:31,330
Okay, I'm waiting for him to come over.

1347
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:33,650
And then...

1348
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:35,250
Oh my god!

1349
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:36,330
What?

1350
01:41:38,370 --> 01:41:39,470
Are you serious?

1351
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,970
He was waiting the entire time?

1352
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:44,910
He was waiting!

1353
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:46,330
That's so cringe!

1354
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:48,130
That's actually so cringe!

1355
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:49,790
Oh my god.

1356
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:51,890
I thought I was being so cheeky.

1357
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:55,070
We were both being cringe.

1358
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:57,230
We were both being cringe, but still.

1359
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:01,530
Oh my god.

1360
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:14,970

Oh!

1364
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:53,400
Oh, I should have brought my shotgun out.

1365
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,490
That's my doctor.

1366
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,380
I really wanted to kill him.

1367
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,360
With the D-fifth.

1368
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,380
You don't understand.

1369
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:06,480
I really wanted to kill him with the D-fifth.

1370
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,320
It was like my life mission.

1371
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:13,640
It had to be done.

1372
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:15,520
It really did.

1373
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:20,300
Oh,

1374
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:36,730

1375
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:37,410
I don't!

1376
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:39,410
Oh, shit!

1377
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:43,370
Let's go!

1378
01:43:51,210 --> 01:43:53,850
It almost worked!

1379
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:55,650
It almost worked!

1380
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:59,190
It almost worked!

1381
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:08,010
Actually, to be fair, it actually did work.

1382
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:16,130
To be fair, if you think about it, it did work.

1383
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:19,070
It actually did work.

1384
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:24,810
I was absolutely gaming there.

1385
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:29,630
I was 100% gaming that.

1386
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,640
Where's my fucking teammate?

1387
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:45,760
I was gonna say, were we not covering each other?

1388
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,740
That's fucking right, res me!

1389
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,380
It did.

1390
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,800
Oh my god, nice.

1391
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:57,940
Don't worry.

1392
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:01,140

01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,820
Okay, okay, I'll play for real.

01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:53,180
Victory D-fib Okay, okay, I won't fuck around anymore I'll play for real A kid Yeah, it kills And most of them I think like five of them were D-fibs kills I'm pretty sure I wish that there's a counter for that I'm pretty sure five of them was just Actual D-fib only Yeah I didn't shoot my gun This is how Battlefield is supposed to play.

1410
01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:56,300
Yeah, I got a positive KDA.

1411
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,440
That's fucking right.

1412
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,020
You're right.

1413
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:01,380
I'm playing how it's supposed to be played.

1414
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:03,000
Not bottom, frag.

1415
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,070
It's the only way.

1416
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:17,550
Okay, I'll defib until, until, like, I'll use my, I'll use it tactically.

1417
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:49,930
when one game streamer has a take with two engineers on a repair non-stop joki out here defibing victory let me go to the menu for this so i'm not lagging i'll match make outside of the screen to defib or not to defib i know it's such a hard choice it's so hard because it's like it's just it's so tempting you know it's it's just there it's it's like calling for me.

1418
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:53,870
It's like the, the, the apple, the snake is like, use it.

1419
01:47:55,890 --> 01:47:58,170
Use the forbidden defib.

1420
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:04,970
Forget all your, forget all the oaths you took as a doctor.

1421
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:09,530
There's no ethics in war, dokey.

1422
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:11,710
Use the defib.

1423
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:14,050
Yeah, my green goblin mask.

1424
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:17,330

I'll be a good player.

1433
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:16,860
It's the Doki way.

1434
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:20,140
It's the only way.

1435
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:23,840
Oh my god, I'm in a museum.

1436
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:26,500
Destroy all heart.

1437
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:31,560
There we go.

1438
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:39,260

He's gonna come over, isn't he?

1442
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:53,840
There you go.

1443
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:55,280

1444
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:58,240

01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:14,180
He was too...

1452
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:17,260
Oh my god, they're losing that badly?

1453
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:21,580
Oh, wait.

1454
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:23,100
It's because there's only one point.

1455
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,200
Okay, that actually makes a lot more sense.

1456
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:27,180
I was like, how are we losing that badly?

1457
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:32,320
I was gonna be so confused.

1458
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:40,180
There's two of you!

1459
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:42,720
Oh my god, there's two of you!

1460
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:44,260
Cage!

1461
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:50,920

1462
01:51:54,840 --> 01:52:01,560

1463
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:11,160

1464
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:20,120
okay we're breaching we're breaching breach breach

1465
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:48,100
maybe if i'm here they won't know oh my god of course of course i was hoping he wasn't gonna peak that way i camped unsuccessfully i chose the wrong place to camp there were too many corners Ooh, that's not.

1466
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:52,140
I think I definitely...

1467
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:52,500
Oh, my.

1468
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:53,640
This is, like, fast.

1469
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,240
No, I definitely joined in late.

1470
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:56,680
Because I'm, like, how...

1471
01:52:58,940 --> 01:52:59,760
Is he dead?

1472
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:01,960
Yeah, I think he's dead.

1473
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:05,020
He didn't fully kill me.

1474
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:06,920
I'm, like, a little lost.

1475
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:09,960
There's a med kit here.

1476
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:11,220
How do I...

1477
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:11,900
Oh, my God.

1478
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:13,140
It's step D now?

1479
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:14,400
Where the fuck is D?

1480
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:15,040
Huh.

1481
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:32,460
he's not i have to say it before you guys say it all right jogging all the way doing my marathon doing my marathon run right now there was shots to my right i know there's a guy to my right i think he's gonna shoot me

1482
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:54,140
yep oh my god i was gonna say i i feel like there's 20 people around me i was like i know there's i there was no cover I was, I just walked up there and I was like, where is everybody?

1483
01:53:56,380 --> 01:53:57,780
I was like, wait a minute.

1484
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:00,060
This does not feel safe.

1485
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:03,500
It does not feel safe.

1486
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:04,100
No!

1487
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:07,700
Let's kill you first.

1488
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,600
I basically spawned them closer, though.

1489
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:14,960
No!

1490
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:15,580
Fuck!

1491
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:17,700
I didn't see where that guy is.

1492
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:19,920
Oh, fucking course, he has a shotgun.

1493
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:20,380
That's fine.

1494
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:22,100
I get closer to E.

1495
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:55,020
yeah i have to like look down i like look down sometimes to check for the objective but it is like hard because like it's it's hard to look at i'm not used to looking at the mini map sometimes wait a is already taken how how is he already taken oh my god i feel like i heard gunshots this way Yeah.

1496
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:57,580
I'm coming over.

1497
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:03,400
Those quarters is definitely much more hectic than...

1498
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:03,880
Actually, no.

1499
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:05,500
No, never mind, no.

1500
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:09,200
Those quarters are not more hectic than the shit I dealt with earlier.

1501
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:11,060
Wait, it's this way.

1502
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:13,380
I always get so confused.

1503
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:17,440
Oh, my God.

1504
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:18,900
I got shot in the back!

1505
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:23,380
But I feel like I have to definitely look at more corners.

1506
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:31,040
I have to look at so many corners.

1507
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:34,040
But no, we're definitely losing this.

1508
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:35,800
Oh, no!

1509
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:38,780
We're definitely losing this.

1510
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:40,800
I don't think our team can make a comeback.

1511
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,600
There's two of you!

1512
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,440
You bitch!

1513
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:49,420
It's fine.

1514
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:49,960
It's fine.

1515
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:51,580
It's fine.

1516
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,680
I'm fracking, though.

1517
01:55:55,420 --> 01:56:26,720
yeah my team does not play the objective i feel like either my team doesn't play the objective or we just die i think we just die i think we just die i i think we just die wait maybe maybe maybe nope he's dead never mind my entire i just watched my entire team die i i just think i didn't know my I just saw my entire team fucking die.

1518
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:28,620
Oh my god.

1519
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:36,480
That's how he took down all of us.

1520
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:38,260
That's how he took down all of us.

1521
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:39,820
That's how he took down all of us.

1522
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:40,780
Yeah.

1523
01:56:45,950 --> 01:56:47,070
That's crazy.

1524
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:50,750
Actually, all three of us died to him.

1525
01:56:51,090 --> 01:56:52,630
That's actually crazy.

1526
01:56:54,710 --> 01:56:54,990
Yay.

1527
01:56:55,870 --> 01:56:56,510
Okay, see?

1528
01:56:56,650 --> 01:56:56,850
Look.

1529
01:56:57,170 --> 01:56:58,870
actually tried them.

1530
01:56:59,210 --> 01:57:14,110
I check your look guys see look look I actually I tried look at that I didn't I didn't do a defib run this time chat I didn't do a defib run

1531
01:57:18,070 --> 01:57:50,370
I I did it alright let's see we'll do one more we custom search okay what do we do we'll do one more i'm not a sandbagger i'm not i'm not a dfib one trick guys look at that i'm not a dfib one trick wait rush okay what do we try rush okay our last game rush but you won with dfib

1532
01:57:55,640 --> 01:58:04,300
yeah but i'm here to prove to you guys that i can shoot my gun too guys i i can't i can do that too chat

1533
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:39,040
simple man and then you will super chat thingy thank you don't keep focus poopy scoopy would be the support i saw you playing like this oh yeah i got the celestial last night yippee it only took me like a day and a half of play like i mean not i mean it took me like i only played like an hour more off stream um obviously i didn't play off stream instantly after I end the stream,

1534
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:41,000
but I took a little break and I came back.

1535
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:44,100
I just uh, oh, I didn't hit start.

1536
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:47,680
And I just played like, I think like two to three games to get it.

1537
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:55,180
So I think like, you know, half a, like a day and a half, um, a day and a half from Diamond 1 to Celestia.

1538
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:58,620
I think that seems pretty a good, I think that's a good climb.

1539
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:36,660
Um, um, but yeah, I think the reason why I don't, I don't play, I, um, don't play a lot of like battlefield or call of duty is that there's not really rank system is there a rank system in battlefield it i for me when i play shooters my the thing that gets me back into playing over and over again is just the fact of the the it's just competitive competitive just makes you play the game over and over and over again um there's rank and call of duty i feel like call but the time to kill is so fast though isn't it I'm just like,

1540
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:38,160
I don't like Rainbow Six Siege, too.

1541
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:40,180
The TTK.

1542
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:46,040
If the TTK is too short, then, like, I don't get super addicted.

1543
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:47,100
It is fun, though.

1544
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:52,160
I would say, um, it is, um, it is very fun.

1545
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,320
It is very fun.

1546
01:59:53,640 --> 02:00:00,960
But for me, like, as a gamer, for me, as a gamer, my type of game style, I played a game over and over again.

1547
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:05,920
Um, if it has a rank system, um, just because that's what gets me super addicted.

1548
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:34,320
that's what that's like that's the addiction for me um yeah that's like my addiction um but it's definitely really fun i'm having a lot of fun playing battlefield i like the gun the guns feel really good except for the sniper fuck fall off like fuck bullet drop oh the RPG doesn't insta kill people unless it's a direct hit but the sniper has fall off like

1549
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:39,600
Yeah.

1550
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,400
Okay, what is Rush?

1551
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:48,580
I have to aim.

1552
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:51,740
Okay, what is Rush, though?

1553
02:00:58,570 --> 02:01:00,590
That's just called balance.

1554
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:04,130
My sniper should be a one-shot one.

1555
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:05,410
This is why I have E-Fib.

1556
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:08,290
If my D...

1557
02:01:09,450 --> 02:01:15,750
If I can't one-shot, one-kill with my sniper, I'll just defib it.

1558
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:20,790
Oh, attack, defend one direction.

1559
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:24,750
Oh.

1560
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:27,470
It's Valorant.

1561
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,020
There's no friendly fire, right?

1562
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:35,400
Because I literally shot that guy.

1563
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:44,160
Okay.

1564
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,360
Give me a sec.

1565
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:48,740
Oh, who am I?

1566
02:01:53,670 --> 02:01:55,150
Give me a sec.

1567
02:01:56,450 --> 02:01:57,250
God.

1568
02:01:58,230 --> 02:01:59,550
Works every time.

1569
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:01,250
It works.

1570
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:03,550
It works every time.

1571
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:04,990
I don't know why.

1572
02:02:05,590 --> 02:02:07,450
But it works every time.

1573
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:09,830
I don't know why it does.

1574
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,040
But it does.

1575
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,820
I don't know how it does but it does

1576
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:37,090
Oh, we have to go down the A Oh, shit Okay, how do we go down the A?

1577
02:02:37,470 --> 02:02:43,370
Guys, I'm a lost I'm a very lost Where are we supposed to go?

1578
02:02:44,130 --> 02:02:48,810
But Where are people finding things?

1579
02:02:49,330 --> 02:02:53,390
Like, I don't even know How do we get downstairs?

1580
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:55,290
Oh, that's how we get downstairs.

1581
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:57,690
Like, how, I was like, how did I...

1582
02:03:03,130 --> 02:03:05,230
Okay, we both figured out how to get downstairs.

1583
02:03:05,470 --> 02:03:06,810
That's good.

1584
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:10,090
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

1585
02:03:11,590 --> 02:03:12,510
Oh, hey guys.

1586
02:03:13,450 --> 02:03:14,230
Don't worry.

1587
02:03:15,110 --> 02:03:16,030
I'm armed.

1588
02:03:17,090 --> 02:03:18,430
Oh, shit!

1589
02:03:18,970 --> 02:03:20,470
I was not expecting that.

1590
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:22,450
We lost eight soldiers.

1591
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:23,030
What?

1592
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:24,490
Ow.

1593
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:31,290
Clear!

1594
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:37,430
Oh shit!

1595
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:37,830
Oh shit!

1596
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:38,410
Turn around!

1597
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:42,050
There you go.

1598
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:42,750
Oh shit!

1599
02:03:43,130 --> 02:03:43,430
Let's move!

1600
02:03:46,350 --> 02:03:46,870
Alright.

1601
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:49,150
Alright.

1602
02:03:52,270 --> 02:03:53,110
Okay, nice.

1603
02:03:58,340 --> 02:04:00,580
Okay, I need to refill my thing.

1604
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:02,300
Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.

1605
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:04,060
Clear!

1606
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:13,900
What?!

1607
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,140
You actual fucker.

1608
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:20,280
I

1609
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:35,960
killed him!

1610
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:37,960
I killed him though it was...

1611
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:45,140
I just spammed him.

1612
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,860
I spammed him until he died.

1613
02:04:48,580 --> 02:04:49,300
Oh shit.

1614
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:51,520
It was so worth it.

1615
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:54,380
It was so fucking worth it.

1616
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,080
Oh wait, that's my teammate.

1617
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:58,020
It was so worth it though.

1618
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:00,600
Oh.

1619
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:05,020
It was so good.

1620
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:07,500
I was like, fuck you.

1621
02:05:08,120 --> 02:05:10,480
I know there was a guy here.

1622
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:15,480
Where are you?

1623
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:20,360
It's worth it.

1624
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:28,120
You can't keep doing this.

1625
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:32,440
I just landed on his head.

1626
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:34,240
Look.

1627
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:39,420
Originally, I wasn't going...

1628
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:41,800
I wasn't trying to kill him.

1629
02:05:43,140 --> 02:05:46,780
I wasn't trying to kill him originally with a T-fib.

1630
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,820
It just happened.

1631
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:50,020
You know?

1632
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:51,260
It just...

1633
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:52,820
It really just happened.

1634
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:55,620
He just happened to be there.

1635
02:05:58,740 --> 02:05:59,540
Okay.

1636
02:06:03,100 --> 02:06:31,620
Jesus Christ There Here we go Oh my god Did he die again There we go It's fine Clear I don't even know where exactly is the people shooting us Oh my god there's like 20 There's so many medics It's literally we're just all medics Wait it's just It's just all medics.

1637
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:48,420
He will never know.

1638
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:49,780
Whoops,

1639
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:54,360
all medics.

1640
02:06:55,700 --> 02:06:57,240
The hunter prowls.

1641
02:06:58,700 --> 02:07:00,280
He'll never know.

1642
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:03,080
Wait, I can't.

1643
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:05,080
This door doesn't work, guys.

1644
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:08,960
Where did he come from?

1645
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:13,360
Oh my god, is there an actual room?

1646
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:15,860
Like...

1647
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:20,030
Holy fuck, how do we get there?

1648
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,620
Oh my god, oh my god.

1649
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:31,210
I don't know how to get there.

1650
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:36,020
Behind us!

1651
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:38,040
Behind us!

1652
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:39,080
Medic!

1653
02:07:40,580 --> 02:07:40,880
Nice.

1654
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:47,080
Ooh, I got you.

1655
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:50,120
Don't worry, I got you.

1656
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:50,800
Oh my god.

1657
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,660
They're so, oh my god.

1658
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:53,600
We did it.

1659
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:54,960
I don't know how we did it.

1660
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:55,840
We did it, guys.

1661
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:01,200
We, we did it.

1662
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:02,300
Nice.

1663
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:08,660
I was a hero.

1664
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:10,600
Gigi.

1665
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:13,800
I was a hero.

1666
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:14,540
Where was I?

1667
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,180
Look at that.

1668
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:17,220
See, look at that, guys.

1669
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:18,440
Look at that.

1670
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:20,380
I actually shot my gun.

1671
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:21,640
And there's some, I just...

1672
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:27,480
I did maybe use my defib, like, every once in a while, but I did shoot my gun.

1673
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:31,740
I finally, guys, I did it.

1674
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:35,220
I got my medical license, guys.

1675
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:36,240
I did it.

1676
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:37,160
Finally.

1677
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:38,220
Okay, one more.

1678
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:38,680
One more.

1679
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:39,880
We'll do a new game mode.

1680
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,320
That one was really fast.

1681
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:44,620
I did everything I needed to do.

1682
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:47,520
I'll do one more, because that was a really fast one.

1683
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:48,900
All right, what else?

1684
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:50,440
Other than Rush, what else?

1685
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:56,160
My license to kill.

1686
02:08:57,860 --> 02:08:58,480
Breakthrough?

1687
02:08:58,900 --> 02:08:59,440
What's breakthrough?

1688
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:03,980
Wait, no, this is what...

1689
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:04,900
Isn't that conquest?

1690
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:10,140
TDM?

1691
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:14,700
Oh, wait, TDM is fun.

1692
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:15,560
Wait.

1693
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:18,320
Is he actually in battlefield?

1694
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:19,380
Is it fun?

1695
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:21,340
Is it fun, though?

1696
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:25,600
Is it fun in battlefield?

1697
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,000
Or is it like...

1698
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:28,940
Uh...

1699
02:09:31,330 --> 02:09:32,130
It's not?

1700
02:09:32,450 --> 02:09:32,810
Okay.

1701
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:33,610
It's not.

1702
02:09:33,770 --> 02:09:34,030
Okay.

1703
02:09:34,670 --> 02:09:35,810
It's alright.

1704
02:09:36,090 --> 02:09:37,130
Okay, we'll try and break through.

1705
02:09:37,250 --> 02:09:38,910
Okay, this one will be the last one then.

1706
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:40,610
Like, any new things?

1707
02:09:43,830 --> 02:09:45,570
Oh, I still feel like you can't afford it.

1708
02:09:46,990 --> 02:09:48,790
Can I customize anything else?

1709
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:52,490
What's this?

1710
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:57,150
Reduces recoil and improves remaining...

1711
02:09:57,150 --> 02:09:57,810
Okay, yeah.

1712
02:09:58,670 --> 02:09:59,190
That's good.

1713
02:09:59,650 --> 02:10:00,630
We like that.

1714
02:10:01,850 --> 02:10:03,030
We like that.

1715
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:07,300
Okay, what else is there?

1716
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:12,100
Wait, moderate at cost of aimed accuracy when moving.

1717
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:15,060
I like moving, so I'm going to keep that.

1718
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:20,240
So those movement speed, well...

1719
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:22,320
Uh...

1720
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:23,100
Nah.

1721
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,060
Okay.

1722
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:28,800
You really laser?

1723
02:10:28,980 --> 02:10:29,980
I like the laser.

1724
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:33,100
Wait, this one?

1725
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:35,580
Wait, what's the laser?

1726
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:36,800
This one?

1727
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:41,220
I like this site.

1728
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:42,220
Wait, is this better?

1729
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:42,800

Oh, I forgot to start my match.

1732
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:54,070

02:11:15,550 --> 02:11:16,390
Where am I?

1741
02:11:16,830 --> 02:11:17,730

They were not safe.

We were definitely.

1750
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:16,700
We were definitely.

1751
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:20,260
Jesus Christ!

1752
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:23,200
Okay, they don't know there's a...

1753
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:25,440
There's a beacon right here.

1754
02:12:25,540 --> 02:12:26,100
They don't know.

1755
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:29,440
They don't know there's a beacon right here.

1756
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:30,660
They don't know.

1757
02:12:32,540 --> 02:12:34,600
This is like our safety beacon.

1758
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:36,060
Wait, that's so good.

1759
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:38,340
good.

1760
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:39,220
What the fuck?

1761
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:44,120
There's no friendly fire.

1762
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:46,580
Jeez, I don't think I like this mode.

1763
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:51,340
I don't think I like this mode.

1764
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:53,820
This mode is fucking crazy.

1765
02:12:58,970 --> 02:13:01,470
No, this mode is actually fucking crazy.

1766
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:02,190
Holy shit.

1767
02:13:04,490 --> 02:13:05,830
Oh my god, bitch.

1768
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:06,770
Wait, did he die?

1769
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:07,330
I can't tap.

1770
02:13:07,690 --> 02:13:08,170
Oh, wait, no.

1771
02:13:09,050 --> 02:13:09,610
What?

1772
02:13:09,930 --> 02:13:12,090
Oh my god, he's behind me!

1773
02:13:13,730 --> 02:13:15,310
He was behind me.

1774
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:16,490
I didn't see.

1775
02:13:18,010 --> 02:13:19,750
Yeah, I literally just joined.

1776
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:23,390
Okay.

1777
02:13:24,230 --> 02:13:24,570
It's fine.

1778
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:27,770
I love this little area for recon.

1779
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:31,130
I got backshot it.

1780
02:13:31,490 --> 02:13:33,350
I don't think I like this game mode.

1781
02:13:34,410 --> 02:13:36,010
Way too fucked up.

1782
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:07,360
Okay, okay, that's good.

1783
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:10,580
That's good, that's good.

1784
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:18,900
Holy shit, what the fuck is going on?

1785
02:14:23,070 --> 02:14:25,750
I don't know how I'm still alive.

1786
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:32,660
Jesus, okay, yeah, no, I'm not anymore.

1787
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:39,880
Medic, medic, medic, medic.

1788
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:40,660
Medic!

1789
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:42,960
Medic!

1790
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:45,200
Medic!

1791
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,460
Okay, I don't think any medic's coming.

1792
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:51,920
Please make sure it's to save your team.

1793
02:14:54,760 --> 02:14:55,920
Also, you.

1794
02:14:58,780 --> 02:14:59,160
No!

1795
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,060
What?

1796
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:03,340
Oh my god, I got finished.

1797
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:04,720
I got finished.

1798
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,320
That's it.

1799
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:05,860
What's his aim?

1800
02:15:05,980 --> 02:15:07,460
Who is the guy that killed me?

1801
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:08,600
That's it.

1802
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:11,460
What was his name?

1803
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:13,300
Guys, tell me his name.

1804
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:15,560
Tell me his name.

1805
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:16,800
That's it.

1806
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:19,280
The doctor is in.

1807
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:23,480
Not yet, though.

1808
02:15:23,740 --> 02:15:24,280
Not now.

1809
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:26,020
When I'm in the house.

1810
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,040
When I'm in the house.

1811
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:31,600
When I'm in the house.

1812
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:32,460
Okay.

1813
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:35,880
Wait, my dog tags.

1814
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:37,880
What does that mean?

1815
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:40,960
What does that mean?

1816
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:47,060
No, that was definitely disrespectful.

1817
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:50,660
There we go.

1818
02:15:55,550 --> 02:15:55,890
Okay.

1819
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:01,420
Oh, wait.

1820
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:03,420
My dog tags got stolen?

1821
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:05,260
How do- what does that do?

1822
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:09,660
What does- Why did he steal my dog tags?

1823
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:11,940
Does he know that's fucked up?

1824
02:16:17,240 --> 02:16:19,000
What does that even do?

1825
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:29,760
Oh, it's just bragging rights.

1826
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:32,120
Alright, how do I do the same thing?

1827
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:33,940
How do I get his...

1828
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:34,940
How do I do that?

1829
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:38,360
How do I also steal someone's dog tags?

1830
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:45,420
I need a no.

1831
02:16:49,210 --> 02:16:50,190
I need a no.

1832
02:16:50,570 --> 02:16:51,290
How do I do...

1833
02:16:51,290 --> 02:16:51,690

1834
02:16:51,690 --> 02:16:53,090
Oh, press F behind him?

Now I know.

1837
02:16:58,350 --> 02:16:59,450
