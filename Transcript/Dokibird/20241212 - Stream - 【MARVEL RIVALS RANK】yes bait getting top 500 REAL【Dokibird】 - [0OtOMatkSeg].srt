00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,550
Hello everybody.

2
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,570
Oh, wait, I'm locked in by the way, no.

3
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,930
Ahahahahaha!

4
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,370
Okay... Let me see...

5
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,990
Sorry, I was late because I was playing Marvel Rivals before I could stream Marvel Rivals.

6
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,430
Um...

7
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,770
Alright, now... Okay!

8
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,150
So...

9
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,450
I... Yeah...

10
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,110
We're back.

11
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,070
And... We are not doing any curse of Ra...

12
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,610
or any curses or anything.

13
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,830
Oh, wait, sorry.

14
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,950
I had my mic on my recording settings.

15
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:20,990
Give me a sec.

16
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,750
I forgot about that.

17
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,290
Okay, now I should sound... there you go.

18
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,570
I just sound better now.

19
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,790
Oh, I'm like loud too.

20
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,410
Oops, sorry.

21
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,450
Give me a sec.

22
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,030
I have everything on my... oh, wait, no, I'm fine.

23
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,770
I have everything on my recording settings.

24
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,970
So, now it's fine.

25
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,070
Okay, so...

26
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,550
So, alright, so I'm sort of climbing a little bit.

27
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,550
I think, I think.

28
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,090
So, there's no curses.

29
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,530
There's no curses right now.

30
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:02,230
Because if you fucking curse me, I will continue to cancel streams and just replace it with Marvel Rivals.

31
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:11,270
If we don't make it to top 500, I will replace all my streams with Marvel Rivals.

32
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,110
Until we get top 500.

33
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,770
So, you better hope that I fucking get top 500 today.

34
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,290
You better fucking hope that.

35
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,030
Or we will never play God of War.

36
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,230
I will fucking hold God of War hostage until I get top 500.

37
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,870
You think I fucking care?

38
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,470
I care about numbers.

39
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,770
I care about being a top 500 gamer right now, alright?

40
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,570
I...

41
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,190
So, don't you fucking act cocky here.

42
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,670
Don't you be a little fucking bitch and curse me guys.

43
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,810
Because we're gonna be here forever.

44
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,270
If we do not make it to top 500 today.

45
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,770
Alright.

46
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,210
So, yes.

47
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:03,750
We now have... we have now optimized our... our queue now.

48
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,330
So, we have Wanted and SK playing with me.

49
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:13,410
And SK and Wanted are... well, to be fair, they're both... well, at least, like, I'll actually have DPS players this time.

50
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:22,890
Because for some fucking reason, every other player in this entire Marvel Rivals lobby are getting too many DPS players.

51
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,290
But I have the opposite of that problem.

52
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,330
I have too many support players in my team.

53
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,090
So, to fix that problem, now I have two DPS players.

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,650
I'd rather have too many DPS players than...

55
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,970
Then... oh, okay.

56
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,910
Now that I said that...

57
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,350
Alright.

58
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,350
Alright, now I have four DPS players.

59
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,170
Now...

60
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,110
Alright.

61
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,370
I... you know what?

62
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,830
No, I deserve that.

63
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,830
I actually...

64
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,150
I... I fucking deserve that.

65
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,770
You know what?

66
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,730
No, that's fine.

67
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,670
Carl, thank you for the super chat.

68
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,390
Thank you, thank you.

69
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,230
The cloud nose goes on after it hits the eight... six hour... the eight hour mark.

70
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,570
Wait, when was the last time I put the cloud nose on?

71
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,230
I don't even remember.

72
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,030
Carl, thank you for the super chat.

73
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,110
Thank you, thank you.

74
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,570
The cloud nose goes on when we hit a breaking point.

75
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,510
We've not yet hit our breaking point.

76
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,670
We're still okay.

77
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,910
No, it's still okay.

78
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,810
We have... we have yet to hit our breaking point.

79
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,070
Also Jarrah, thank you for the super chat.

80
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,930
Thank you, thank you.

81
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,150
Alright, here we go.

82
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,830
Maybe we'll get to see plat one again.

83
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,490
Wouldn't that be fucking crazy?

84
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,030
What the fuck?

85
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,130
Oh my god.

86
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,970
What?

87
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,290
What the fuck is going on here?

88
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,010
What the fuck?

89
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,010
I don't even... what the fuck is going on?

90
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,230
We lived?

91
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,790
I mean, okay.

92
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,030
Yay, we lived!

93
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,370
Now this is my house now.

94
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,450
See, look.

95
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,410
It's not too bad.

96
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,150
Guys, that wasn't too bad.

97
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,090
It looked pretty rough in the loading screen, not gonna lie.

98
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,670
In the starting screen it looked rough, but like, we made it work.

99
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,670
We made it work.

100
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,530
I do hope I end top five.

101
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,710
Like, I could end top 500 though.

102
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:58,450
Oh.

103
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,490
Alright, that was not my fault.

104
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,630
I could not see him.

105
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,070
Well, I think he's gonna fucking eat me.

106
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,470
Oh shit!

107
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,530
Sorry, I didn't realize.

108
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,570
Sorry, I didn't realize SK was getting beat up behind me.

109
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,970
No, no BC for now.

110
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,110
I wanna chill a little bit before I get into BC territory.

111
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,510
I wanna chill.

112
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,210
No, that's the worst part.

113
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:41,110
The worst part is that for Qs, DPS...

114
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,730
Oh shit, again!

115
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,250
DPS gets more... Oh, what the fuck?

116
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,410
I thought he would go the other way, not gonna lie.

117
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,530
Jesus Christ.

118
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,310
Oh my god, okay.

119
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,110
I'm ready to dance.

120
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,890
It's dancing time.

121
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,510
It's still dancing time.

122
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:06,670
What was I gonna say?

123
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,730
Oh yeah, DPS gets more... I don't even know what it's called.

124
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,810
LP?

125
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,450
What is it called for Marvel rivals?

126
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,950
SR?

127
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,990
Oh my god, Captain America.

128
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,650
I'm dancing.

129
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,290
I dance so hard.

130
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,270
Points?

131
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,390
Oh yeah, DPS gets more points.

132
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,130
I don't know.

133
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,390
Overwatch is SR.

134
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,050
Apex is LP.

135
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,230
What the fuck is Marvel rivals thing called?

136
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,070
I need to get some gamer subs.

137
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,450
I'm not okay.

138
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,210
Gotta hit a wall.

139
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,590
I'm not okay.

140
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,070
You can tell I'm not okay right now.

141
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,750
Alright, I'm going this way.

142
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,920
Where's our tank?

143
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,680
Oh, there he is.

144
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,560
He's gonna put 19 inches of venom.

145
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,400
Not on me though.

146
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,260
Oh my god!

147
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,480
It's fine, we're fine.

148
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,340
Where the fuck does Spider-Man go?

149
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,680
Oh, I'm scared.

150
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,560
Please, guys.

151
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,400
Your team's capture progress, guys.

152
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,060
Oh no, not the Assemble.

153
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,540
It's fine, we're safe here.

154
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,320
Oh, I don't feel safe anymore.

155
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,800
I need to reload.

156
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,320
Oh no, I almost got it!

157
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,540
I almost got him!

158
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,560
I was so close.

159
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
Poppy, thank you for the super chat.

160
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
Thank you, thank you.

161
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,320
Good luck on the rank.

162
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,040
Today's my birthday.

163
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,840
I wanted to wish you luck and share money.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,740
Thank you for the super chat.

165
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,600
Thank you, thank you.

166
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,400
Happy birthday to you.

167
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,280
Happy birthday to you.

168
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,280
Happy birthday, dear Kofi.

169
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,740
Happy birthday to you.

170
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,900
Oh, time to enter the portal.

171
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,240
Dance!

172
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,300
I almost ran and danced, girl!

173
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,540
I don't know if you guys noticed this, but I almost dropped into the hole.

174
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,560
How did we...?

175
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Guys, we can't leave.

176
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,820
We can't leave the...

177
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:36,700
No!

178
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,620
No!

179
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,060
Oh, thank god.

180
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,970
Oh no.

181
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,030
There's so many people that need heals.

182
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,010
I got PTSD over Hella.

183
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,990
Because I feel like...

184
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,370
I feel like Hella's always targeting me.

185
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,050
Oh god.

186
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,390
Got another portal.

187
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,770
Guys!

188
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,650
Guys!

189
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:11,990
No!

190
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,610
Guys,

191
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,300
where's our portal?

192
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,100
Where the fuck is our portal?

193
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,680
Dr. Strange, make a... Oh, he's dead.

194
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,880
He's dead.

195
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,940
I actually won because of the portal.

196
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,020
Because of the portal.

197
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,180
Portal!

198
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,420
No!

199
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
Oh, Strange can't do much no more?

200
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,720
Nice.

201
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,580
That's what I like to hear.

202
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,140
After this, I'm gonna make some gamer subs.

203
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I need to lock in.

204
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,440
I need to fucking lock in.

205
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,080
I don't even know who to... Okay, I'll give it to one dude.

206
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,700
I always give it to...

207
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,980
I give it to whoever I'm playing with.

208
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,020
So they can't complain about lack of heals on their stream.

209
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,450
That's the only... That's the only reason.

210
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,030
Alright, here we go.

211
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,370
It's optimal.

212
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,770
Are you real?

213
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,130
King is like, okay.

214
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,330
Okay, come on.

215
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,610
Oh, he's so low.

216
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,850
Come on.

217
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,970
He's dead.

218
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,630
What the fuck?

219
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,610
Oh my god, I didn't even notice him.

220
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,770
I was like wondering who fucking is beating me at the fuck up in the back.

221
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,350
I need to like get my awareness needs to be a bit better.

222
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,710
I legit was so confused.

223
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,090
I was like, I'm getting beat up.

224
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,130
Who could it be?

225
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,050
Oh, you mean the giant fucking incredible Hulk in the back?

226
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,900
Hulk is one of the sneakiest characters out there.

227
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,900
I don't know if you guys know that.

228
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,850
I'm gonna say it.

229
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,270
I know like...

230
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,950
Oh my god, what is he doing?

231
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,870
He's so low.

232
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:43,730
Oh!

233
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,510
Jump down here if you don't... Sorry.

234
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,810
I jumped down.

235
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,770
I'm stalling.

236
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,230
I'm stalling.

237
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,970
I'm stalling.

238
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,430
I'm stalling.

239
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,710
I stalled for so long.

240
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,250
I stalled for so long.

241
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,050
I stalled for so long.

242
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,270
Please guys, no.

243
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,170
Don't say that guys.

244
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,590
We need to end this fast.

245
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,270
Guys, don't say that.

246
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,110
Guys, please.

247
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,230
Please.

248
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,410
I can't say that.

249
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,130
We'll be fine.

250
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,130
I believe.

251
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,870
Okay.

252
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,630
Oh, I'm locking in.

253
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,050
There's like a Psylocke right behind us.

254
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,770
She's really annoying.

255
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,050
She's being a little bitch right now.

256
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,970
What the fuck?

257
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,290
Pizza roll.

258
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,790
Are you okay?

259
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,340
Nice.

260
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,320
Okay, this is way too close for comfort though.

261
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,240
This is way too close for comfort.

262
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,460
The games are getting like harder because people are learning how to play.

263
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,160
So like, people are being like more coordinated.

264
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,240
And they... Ohhhhkay.

265
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,620
Oh shit.

266
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,120
Double I.

267
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,260
No.

268
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,070
Me too.

269
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,010
Dad's with me.

270
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,910
I'm also ready.

271
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,910
I'm ready.

272
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,530
Oh shit.

273
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,050
One fear.

274
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:02,710
One fear.

275
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,210
No.

276
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:08,990
Nice.

277
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,020
I always get solo ulted by Psy.

278
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,680
I think it's because like...

279
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,620
I mean, that's literally how you gotta play Psy.

280
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,020
You just gotta solo ult the fucking support.

281
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,100
But by God, it makes me so mad.

282
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,640
Because I can't do anything about... How do you hit that?

283
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,120
How do you hit an ice hunter?

284
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,820
What, you gotta have like fucking eyes that can see 500 frames per second?

285
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,020
Is that how?

286
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,160
Like, how?

287
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,760
I literally have to like... My eyes have to be like 500 frames per second.

288
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,620
By the way, guys.

289
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,340
I think you'll be proud to find out.

290
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,660
I'm not one trick anymore.

291
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,120
I can play Cloak and Dagger.

292
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,620
Now I can play both Cloak and Dagger, guys.

293
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,740
I finally realized how to play Cloak, guys.

294
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,820
I fucking figured it out, chat.

295
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,280
I figured it out.

296
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,740
She's suppressing a 3-trick.

297
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,570
And then like... And then my Mantis is not that of a troll pick anymore.

298
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,520
Now... Now...

299
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,420
I can like sort of use my ability.

300
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,880
So like, you know, if Luna gets picked, that's fine.

301
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,220
It's not the end of the world this time.

302
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,460
For once, it's not the end of the world.

303
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,340
I'm not... I won't be that mad.

304
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,160
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

305
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,750
How did I not kill her?

306
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,250
Oh, she was one!

307
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,980
How is she still alive?

308
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,180
I think... Oh.

309
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,860
Okay.

310
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,080
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,940
Oh, shit.

312
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,860
Oh!

313
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,320
Oh, shit!

314
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,640
Guys, we gotta... Hey, guys.

315
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,420
Oh my god, that's so fucked up!

316
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,920
I hate Groot.

317
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,700
I fucking hate... Oh my god, I... I...

318
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,700
I'm full of you.

319
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,380
Oh my god, I hate Groot.

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,540
I'm gonna burn all trees after this.

321
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,610
I'm taking a while.

322
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,950
I'm just gonna window shop.

323
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,150
Oh my god!

324
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:10,490
Okay.

325
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,620
What?!

326
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,160
Okay,

327
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,920
I actually did not expect that.

328
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,320
I didn't think she would actually see me.

329
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,440
Holy... That's crazy!

330
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,520
That was such a crazy peek from her.

331
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,960
I hear a Psylocke, though.

332
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,400
I hear her fucking footsteps.

333
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,020
I hate trees.

334
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,900
I hate trees.

335
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,260
I fucking hate trees.

336
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,720
Okay, we're fine.

337
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:16,880
We're fine.

338
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,360
We're okay.

339
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,380
We're okay.

340
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,760
Fuck trees.

341
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,880
We're so okay.

342
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,340
Oh, come on!

343
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,340
Give me this win!

344
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:39,960
Please!

345
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,470
No!

346
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,150
Pizza roll!

347
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,590
Pizza roll!

348
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,330
Oh my god.

349
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,650
Oh, pizza roll.

350
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,490
You gave me a little heart attack there.

351
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,190
Because we cannot re-contest this if we lose.

352
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,250
Oh, they have Hella ult, but I don't think I have...

353
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,920
Oh!

354
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,720
Speaking of Hella ult...

355
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:25,990
What?!

356
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,710
I can't defend all of that.

357
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,270
I can't defend all that.

358
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,530
What do I do?

359
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,810
I'm just...

360
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,190
I'm just a little...

361
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,750
Fuck me!

362
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,870
I just have one ult!

363
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,850
I just have one fucking ult!

364
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,230
If this person, if Penny Parker, shows up on my stream...

365
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,670
We ban them.

366
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,270
For taking my elo.

367
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,790
That's right.

368
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,870
If you show your face in my stream...

369
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,870
You're getting banned!

370
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,150
For taking my fucking elo!

371
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,630
That's what you fucking get!

372
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,750
No one takes my elo and fucking lives in my chat!

373
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,630
No one!

374
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,710
No one!

375
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,610
Takes my elo!

376
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,730
Where are you Penny?

377
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,370
Where the fuck are you?

378
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,870
I'm gonna go get...

379
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,230
Oh shit, nevermind.

380
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,750
I was gonna say, I'm gonna get some Anuka honey.

381
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,710
No, don't say that!

382
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,770
I was climbing!

383
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:42,730
Chat!

384
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,910
I was actually climbing!

385
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:47,390
Guys!

386
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,930
Don't say that!

387
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,590
I was actually...

388
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,390
Going up!

389
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,980
Wait, wait, wait.

390
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,020
We were actually fucking going up!

391
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,480
I saw my elo rise!

392
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,080
I stream and then I get cursed.

393
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,770
Oh my god.

394
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,030
It's the life.

395
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,370
It really is.

396
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,590
It's the streamer life.

397
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,450
No we don't, we don't need the opposite.

398
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,310
We don't need the opposite of that, guys.

399
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,890
Please.

400
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,110
I was almost back to plat one.

401
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,130
Please.

402
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,330
Guys, okay.

403
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,750
I'm gonna lock in for this game.

404
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,530
No talking for me.

405
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,030
Because I'm resting my voice right now.

406
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,730
Okay guys.

407
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,970
This game, we're resting our voice.

408
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,270
Alright.

409
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,470
I believe.

410
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,370
Alright, lock in.

411
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,290
Alright guys, it's time to lock in.

412
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,870
Doki is locking in.

413
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,930
I'm putting it on.

414
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,870
Doki is locking in!

415
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,590
It's happening!

416
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,520
Okay, that guy fucking is an idiot.

417
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,400
How the fuck did he die like one second?

418
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,160
Okay, lock in.

419
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,010
I'm moving so much, I'm sorry.

420
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,030
Oh

421
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:15,770
my god, I'm so unlucky.

422
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,090
I'm so unlucky.

423
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,130
I had to peek because I wanted heals.

424
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,990
I had to peek because I wanted heals.

425
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,790
Jesus Christ.

426
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,730
This Hanzo or Hawkeye is really good.

427
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:35,590
This Hanzo or Hawkeye is really good.

428
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,510
Oh my god, he's so good!

429
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,800
He's actually crazy!

430
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,280
We have zero kills.

431
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,960
Guys.

432
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,880
Guys, I think I started this stream and I got jinxed.

433
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:53,960
Guys, I think I started this stream and I got jinxed.

434
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,020
I think...

435
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,600
I think I started this stream and then the curse became...

436
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,540
I thought I got...

437
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:11,900
I legitimately thought there was no curse because we were winning all our games but then I think the curse only works if I...

438
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,220
if I stream.

439
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,400
I think that's it.

440
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,580
Legitimately, I think I figured it out.

441
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,180
It only works when I'm streaming.

442
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,410
Oh no, please.

443
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,150
Don't root this.

444
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,370
I'm so scared.

445
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,200
Okay, we're fine.

446
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,760
We're so healthy.

447
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,720
Oh.

448
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,340
I hear footsteps and I'm scared.

449
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
I'm scared.

450
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,720
I hear footsteps and I don't want to die.

451
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,180
Oh, come on.

452
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,820
Oh, it's the goat feet!

453
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,880
It's just goat feet.

454
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,430
I was like, what's that footstep?

455
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,050
Alright.

456
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,930
We're all gonna dance.

457
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,190
Cause we love to dance.

458
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:03,330
Woo!

459
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:09,750
Okay.

460
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,210
Oh my god.

461
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,060
Oh.

462
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,920
No, no.

463
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,580
Oh my god, I...

464
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,580
No.

465
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,220
No.

466
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,040
No!

467
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,940
He peeked me!

468
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,610
I didn't think he would look at me.

469
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,570
I thought he was fucking blind.

470
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,330
I'm scared.

471
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,060
Guys!

472
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:14,740
Guys!

473
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,300
Guys, burn the trees!

474
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,620
Fuck on trees!

475
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,720
Okay, nice.

476
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,160
Nice.

477
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,800
Okay, they have two fights left.

478
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,860
I need ult, though.

479
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,460
Please.

480
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,540
I hear him now.

481
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:54,660
I think it's bad that Groot is in this game, cause now it makes me really fucking hate trees.

482
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,580
Like...

483
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,240
I...

484
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,560
Oh,

485
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,780
thank god.

486
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,840
I was gonna die.

487
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,360
Okay.

488
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,320
I had to.

489
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,220
Nice, we got Loki, though.

490
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,420
That's good.

491
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,760
We had to.

492
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,740
Okay, that's good.

493
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,880
That's good that Loki forced my support ult, cause he died for it.

494
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,110
Oh, thank god.

495
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,710
I will become the one slayer.

496
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,210
Because of Marvel Rivals, I'll fucking...

497
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,050
I'll become the one slayer.

498
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,530
I now understand the one slayer.

499
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,730
You know, I sang his song, so how bad can I be was like super catchy, but now...

500
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,350
Now I understand his message.

501
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,650
Now I actually understand his message.

502
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,770
Please, no.

503
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:21,950
Every tree, every tree I see, I'm gonna bring a Doki Amber Doge to it, and I hope he pees on that tree.

504
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,190
I hope all the nourishment he gets is just from my dog.

505
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,800
If it rains, I'm gonna fucking put like a tarp around a tree, my designated tree, so he'll never get water.

506
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,160
And then every morning and night, I'll bring my dog over to that tree, and that's all it's gonna drink.

507
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:51,820
That's all.

508
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,440
I'll pick a tree, and then I'll be like, I'll name you Groot.

509
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,980
And then maybe I'll buy another dog so I can target two trees.

510
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,260
That's true.

511
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,900
Damn, Doki, that's...

512
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,840
Bro, Doki, that's really fucking crazy.

513
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,470
It's time.

514
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,610
Maybe I'll live.

515
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,020
Oh my god.

516
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,420
Pizza roll, please.

517
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,480
Pizza roll, you're scaring me, pizza.

518
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,880
Get the tree, get the tree!

519
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,040
That's all I care about.

520
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,660
Get the fucking tree.

521
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,410
Nice.

522
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:10,230
If we run out of oxygen, that's the risk I'm willing to take.

523
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,090
You can fucking credit me if we suddenly run out of oxygen.

524
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,610
I'm willing to take all credit for it.

525
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,210
So I can finally sell what I've always wanted to sell.

526
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,250
Bottled air.

527
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,490
I can finally be like my Oshie.

528
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,530
Jesus Christ.

529
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,070
Goodbye.

530
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,780
Wait, guys, I wanna know.

531
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,840
Does my ult outheal in the moral?

532
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,040
Skating.

533
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,500
Does it outheal in the moral?

534
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,840
Cause I know it does not outheal a fucking Magneto ult.

535
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,660
I don't know, try.

536
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,320
Guys, I can't just try it.

537
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,960
I can't just try it.

538
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,160
Yeah, fuck that Pacific clone.

539
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,240
Oh, she's one!

540
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,910
Alright, we're five.

541
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,870
You fucker!

542
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,810
We will damage boost.

543
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,350
We will damage all of this.

544
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,550
There's no way.

545
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,970
You actual fucker.

546
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,610
I will do a dance-off with you.

547
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,490
You think, you think you're a better dancer than me?

548
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,370
I've been dancing for definitely more than 20 hours.

549
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,370
Hey, I know that guy!

550
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,090
Not really.

551
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,390
He's in my queue though.

552
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,390
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

553
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,820
I can't believe I got 99.

554
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,200
I- oh my god, I'm- AAAAAH!

555
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,380
Okay, I shouldn't.

556
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,660
I need to- I need to calm down.

557
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,020
Doki, you got it.

558
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,480
Yeah, calm down, Doki.

559
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,080
Oh my god.

560
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:09,930
Fucking...

561
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,450
Wow.

562
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:16,090
I can't wait to have Mr. Ballwasher as my tank.

563
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,250
At least we know he practices good hygiene.

564
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,840
Am I winning?

565
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,380
For once in my life, in Marvel Rivals, I am.

566
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,540
I know it's a crazy concept, guys.

567
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,080
It's fucking crazy.

568
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,220
Oh my god, we have two- Is it my birthday?

569
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,180
We have two tanks?

570
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,400
Oh my god.

571
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Oh my god, happy birthday!

572
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,560
Happy birthday!

573
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh my god.

574
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,940
I don't think I've seen two tanks in a long time.

575
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:07,780
Oh.

576
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,680
Okay, is Google mapping right now?

577
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,720
Is Google mapping?

578
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,100
Oh, I'm fucking just behind their Jeff and their Hela.

579
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,200
I froze somebody.

580
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,400
Don't worry.

581
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,120
I'll come in soon.

582
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,240
I should come in before like we- Oh my god.

583
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,260
Oh my god!

584
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,420
The portal literally just closed!

585
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,100
Oh.

586
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,700
Oh.

587
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,860
Oh!

588
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,100
You guys, um...

589
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,480
It's like I wasn't- You know, they didn't know.

590
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,860
Oh my god, did it again!

591
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,660
That did not happen again!

592
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,960
Oh my god!

593
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,020
I'm just- Dude, fuck me, I guess.

594
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,240
Oh my god.

595
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,060
I'm not aware of my surroundings there.

596
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,980
No, I take full blame for that.

597
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,920
I take full blame for that.

598
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,520
I was not aware of my surroundings on that specific map.

599
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,840
Like...

600
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,700
Oh my god.

601
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,320
And then the Jeff to eat me at the end.

602
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,960
That's so fucked.

603
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,040
That's actually so fucked.

604
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,320
Alright, now I'm aware of my surroundings.

605
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,420
It's not gonna happen again, I swear.

606
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,440
Okay.

607
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,340
Um, okay.

608
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,820
I don't even know if we should engage with this.

609
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,060
Like...

610
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,570
Jesus Christ.

611
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,670
I'm-

612
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,000
Jesus.

613
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,280
You're just- You'll just live forever, I guess.

614
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,700
Until you don't?

615
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,360
Oh!

616
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,120
Oh!

617
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,780
Oh, I time!

618
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,920
Yippee!

619
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,140
Alright, okay.

620
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,340
Alright.

621
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,800
Uh, that's a lot of ults.

622
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,940
Oh, that is- That was a lot of ults there.

623
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,060
Yeah, I- Yeah.

624
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,320
Hahaha.

625
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,000
I will admit that the first fight I trolled, but like I picked it back up.

626
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,320
It's not fully my fault anymore.

627
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,350
I just think our Venom is having a rough time.

628
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,630
I have to heal- Okay.

629
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,690
I can portal.

630
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,850
I'm portaling in for now, dude.

631
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,470
All I'm saying is, Japheth's gonna fucking eat us.

632
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,650
Oh!

633
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,590
Oh!

634
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,770
Oh!

635
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,130
Oh my god!

636
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,290
Oh my god!

637
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,050
Oh!

638
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,250
Bro, Japheth just- Japheth was just there!

639
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,530
And then Japh- Hahaha!

640
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,670
Oh my god, he fucking jumped down!

641
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,870
And then- And then Japheth was right there!

642
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,890
I think- I just think it- Oh my-

643
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:26,570
Not only will I kill our trees, burn all the trees, but I'll find every shark out there in the ocean.

644
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,850
Why do we need sharks?

645
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:38,570
I think like, they make Japh- Hoping to increase awareness of sharks, and how they're cute.

646
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,330
But, it was the opposite effect.

647
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:53,390
Cause now, in my head, I'm thinking, Jaws was right, and we should've kept going.

648
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,830
Wait- Hahaha!

649
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:06,850
Now, in my head, I wish we kept going with Jaws, and the message.

650
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,300
I added- They added more reasons for my hate.

651
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,600
I didn't hate sharks before, but now I do.

652
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,940
I used to be like, those weak fuckers, who were like, Guys, please, sharks are good people.

653
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:43,680
Every year, only one- Only five people die from shark wounds, every year, which is very low compared to like, vending machines.

654
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,420
And now I'm thinking, I don't care about any stats.

655
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,600
But like, I know what's going on in Marvel Rivals.

656
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,520
Hahaha!

657
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,300
Hahaha!

658
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,710
Oh my god!

659
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,340
Oh my god, please.

660
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,580
Oh, I stayed on point for as long as I could!

661
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,000
Winnable!

662
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,120
Guys, I don't think that was winnable, guys.

663
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,180
I don't- I don't think that was winnable.

664
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,240
Oh shit, what?

665
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,540
Wait, on stream labs?

666
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,100
Oh hey, that's not me.

667
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:00,910
It's fine.

668
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:01,850
It's fine.

669
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,110
It's fine.

670
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,930
I'm- I'm so fine.

671
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,410
I'm- I'm okay.

672
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,130
I am okay.

673
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:12,190
I'm okay.

674
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,490
It's not 99 anymore.

675
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,190
It's not 99 anymore.

676
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,790
That's all that matters.

677
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,910
Look guys, I think- I think it's doable.

678
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,010
We just- You know, we get the bad losses out of the way.

679
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,750
And then- Do we get the same- Okay, we did it.

680
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,410
Oh my god, we got- We didn't avoid him!

681
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,690
Why did we avoid the fuck- Oh.

682
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,690
We did not avoid.

683
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,670
We forgot to- We didn't avoid this guy.

684
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,390
I think it's dumb that you can't avoid here.

685
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,290
I wanna avoid here.

686
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,310
On here.

687
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,590
I want- I want to be able to avoid right here.

688
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:11,700
You can't avoid- You have to wait until you're at the- The game- You have to wait until you're at the game end screen.

689
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:13,600
No.

690
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,800
Don't say that.

691
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,400
Don't say that.

692
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:18,920
Four hours.

693
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,380
That's the max, I think.

694
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:21,860
Well.

695
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,420
I predict it'll take me four hours.

696
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:34,840
I- Why can't, like, the enemy team have, like, fucking four plus support players?

697
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,120
Why is it always me?

698
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,260
I predict four hours.

699
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,920
I just need to get- The moment I get to plat one, it's gonna be smooth sailing.

700
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,420
Right there.

701
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,160
Right here.

702
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,080
Right now.

703
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:03,260
The moment- The moment- Plat one.

704
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,060
Things will be okay.

705
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,260
I won't fall off.

706
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,100
Round two.

707
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,040
I'm not gonna fall off this time.

708
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,280
In the back, when they TP.

709
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,200
They're gonna TP, aren't they?

710
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,040
Oh, they're not TPing.

711
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,780
Oh my god.

712
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,860
They have a Hanzo.

713
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,060
I'm scared.

714
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,260
A good Hanzo with this healer is actually so scary, though.

715
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,330
Okay, it's fine.

716
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,650
I'm thinking right now.

717
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,990
I'm using my brain.

718
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,730
I'm using my brain.

719
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,170
I'm staying on high- Oh, shit.

720
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,330
No, I should go to my team.

721
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,270
I'm focusing so hard.

722
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,270
I'm not gonna do the fancy jump.

723
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,750
I'm just gonna use the stairs for once in my life.

724
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,250
I'm not gonna use the shortcut.

725
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:11,650
Oh, there they are.

726
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,340
I'm trying!

727
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:22,420
I'm trying!

728
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,720
Guys,

729
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,590
I think we should touch.

730
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:45,870
No!

731
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,310
I got it!

732
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:53,110
What the fuck?!

733
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,470
I can't get that to the portal!

734
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,400
What the fuck?!

735
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,260
That portal was fucking crazy!

736
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:23,120
I got kidnapped by my own fucking ally!

737
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,260
That portal was such a- I was like, where am I?

738
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,960
Where did I go?

739
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,680
Like, where did I go?

740
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,640
Oh my god.

741
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,900
That was so unlucky.

742
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:49,120
That's actually- That's actually what a crazy portal that griefed me.

743
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,760
That portal actually griefed the shit out of me.

744
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,100
No.

745
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,720
No, I felt it too.

746
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,620
I felt it in my heart.

747
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,440
I knew that was gonna happen too.

748
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,880
I was like, I feel like I'm about to get eyed.

749
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,110
Yeah, no, I'm definitely avoiding him.

750
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:25,490
When I- If I have the time- It gives me the fucking time to avoid.

751
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,590
Oh my god.

752
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,350
Bro!

753
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,220
You're so fast!

754
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,530
I don't know what to do.

755
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,030
I don't know.

756
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,990
I don't know what to do.

757
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:51,410
Like...

758
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,930
I don't fucking know.

759
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:56,230
It's okay, it's not me, guys.

760
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,910
At least we know one's name.

761
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,930
It's not me.

762
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,890
Jesus Christ, our Venom feeds so much.

763
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,690
That's the biggest issue.

764
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,510
I think our Venom is just a feeder.

765
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,620
Oh, who did he take?

766
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,020
I'm ready to put on a show.

767
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,080
Yippee!

768
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,800
Yay!

769
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:29,860
Kill him.

770
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,500
Kill him.

771
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,560
If you don't kill him, I will fucking cry.

772
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,580
Please!

773
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,140
Please!

774
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,460
Oh my god.

775
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,090
He's getting closer.

776
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,710
He's getting closer.

777
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,360
Don't worry, he can't see my face yet.

778
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:15,780
He's dead.

779
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,480
I'll live.

780
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,040
Oh my god!

781
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,840
I'm sorry.

782
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,160
I don't know how the fuck you live.

783
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:30,980
He's one.

784
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,880
I don't know who I'm saying that to, because I'm not in the voice chat.

785
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,300
But guys, he's one.

786
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,120
Please, I swear to god.

787
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,560
I thought that was just for him.

788
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:42,760
Venom.

789
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:47,870
Venom, please.

790
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,110
Oh my god, okay.

791
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,090
You know what?

792
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:52,970
We take this.

793
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,770
What the fuck is he doing there?

794
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,260
Oh my god, please.

795
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,840
Oh, I have to use this.

796
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,440
Please.

797
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,400
No!

798
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,240
No, I also hate all spiders too.

799
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,780
I hate a lot of things.

800
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:39,160
I used to never hate a lot of things, but after playing Marvel Rivals, I started to hate.

801
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,500
I'm the hater now.

802
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,620
I don't know, fuck it.

803
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:55,280
Seeing, if I, every time I see a Peter Parker, by the way, I'm definitely afraid of bugs, but like, if I, I would fucking go outside and squish a spider.

804
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,160
For every time a Peter Parker annoys me.

805
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:04,800
Run.

806
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,040
Run, you're such a bitch.

807
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,460
Alright, I'm going outside and squishing a spider.

808
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,000
Alright.

809
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,340
No!

810
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,340
No!

811
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,100
No!

812
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,180
No!

813
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,740
I'm at my hater arc now.

814
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,140
This is my hater arc.

815
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,880
Are we

816
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:56,730
fucked up?

817
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:56,850
Nope.

818
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,990
I get zero heals?

819
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:01,970
Who?

820
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:03,650
Who is it?

821
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:08,310
What do you mean you get zero heals?

822
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:11,770
All I did was heal.

823
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,190
Who was it?

824
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:24,070
There's no way.

825
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,550
All I do is fucking clap.

826
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:31,410
No, it's not the Venom that's complaining.

827
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,490
It's the Doctor Strange.

828
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,830
I'm like, that cannot be true.

829
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,310
All I do is fucking clap.

830
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,170
I haven't existed in any other way.

831
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,970
All I do is go, clap, clap.

832
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:46,570
Okay, not that.

833
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:47,750
I don't want to waste my cooldown yet.

834
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:56,700
Alright.

835
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,300
I feel like we do need a Doctor Strange, though.

836
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,760
Oh, we got him.

837
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,260
Welp, we're tied.

838
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,980
Welp, nevermind.

839
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,560
We're not tied anymore.

840
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,420
We're not even anymore.

841
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,250
Oh my god, please.

842
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:32,330
Please.

843
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,220
I will fucking- oh my god!

844
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,200
Alright.

845
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,560
That's awkward.

846
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,860
Good luck, my man.

847
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,740
Hope you hit that one shot.

848
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,640
Just gotta hit one shot.

849
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,720
Sleepy, hope you hit that one shot.

850
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,340
If you hit that one shot, Sleepy.

851
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,620
Oh, you're almost there.

852
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,120
What is this?

853
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:12,310
Just one shot!

854
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,410
Just one shot!

855
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,480
Wait, SK's on Spider-Man?

856
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

857
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,060
Yeah, like...

858
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,520
I don't know.

859
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,800
That's not me.

860
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,400
That was not a me issue.

861
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,880
It's the stream curse.

862
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,720
It's the curse of Ra.

863
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,600
I was winning almost all my games off stream.

864
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,380
It's literally the curse of Ra.

865
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,300
All my off stream games, I was winning.

866
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,640
I started the stream so close.

867
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,300
So close.

868
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,780
Nice, he fucked up.

869
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:24,850
Come on.

870
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,040
Come on.

871
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,260
Jesus Christ, thank God.

872
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,040
I don't know if we'll win this.

873
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,080
Our team fucking sucks.

874
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,800
Our Venom fucking sucks.

875
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,400
I don't think Venom is the play.

876
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,760
He feeds so much.

877
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,720
It's our Venom.

878
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,240
I'm sorry.

879
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,160
Goodbye, guys.

880
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,160
This is where you all die.

881
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,720
Oh, Penny, why did you...

882
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,680
Oh, Penny!

883
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,140
Wrong way!

884
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,640
Wrong way, Penny!

885
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:25,170
Okay, that's fine.

886
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,460
Oh, we cannot help you.

887
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,100
Sorry, SK.

888
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:44,800
Guys, if we lose faster and not cap the point we can queue into our other game and optimize our queue times.

889
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:51,880
Instead of you know playing through hell.

890
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,880
We need to optimize the queue hours.

891
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,880
We're stalling the inedible.

892
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,100
Oh my God.

893
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,040
Who the fuck is shooting me?

894
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,300
There's no reason for me to ult here.

895
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,420
Oh my God, I'm ulting.

896
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,060
There's no reason, but I'll still do it.

897
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,530
Yay!

898
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:47,230
Let me stand in front of all of them.

899
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,610
Okay, I stopped him.

900
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:56,810
Hey, guys!

901
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,730
I stopped him!

902
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,580
Goodbye.

903
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,100
Goodbye.

904
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,400
Goodbye, Penny.

905
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,160
Guys, no.

906
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,180
Don't cap, guys.

907
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,520
No, don't do this to me.

908
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,060
Guys, please.

909
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,880
You don't need to cap, guys.

910
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,000
Who the fuck said that?

911
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:30,740
This guy?

912
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,780
The sleepy guy?

913
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,220
They literally said pocket me?

914
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,260
What about me?

915
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,200
Oh my God, please.

916
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,140
Alright.

917
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,600
Alright.

918
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,660
Oh no, we're gonna cap.

919
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,780
Oh no.

920
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,180
Oh no.

921
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:03,980
Oh.

922
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,580
No, we're gonna cap.

923
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,760
No!

924
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,340
Okay.

925
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,860
I knew we could do it, team.

926
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,480
Guys, I knew we could do it.

927
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,160
Oh my God.

928
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,760
What a team.

929
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,620
God, I wish I can fucking...

930
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,200
Oh, I wish I could just step on you.

931
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,020
Oh, I didn't fucking see you.

932
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,660
You got spread out on the fucking pavement.

933
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,560
It's fine, I'm...

934
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:49,080
I'll just say that Marvel Watch has definitely...

935
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,600
has definitely fucked me up.

936
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:58,390
I tried.

937
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:00,530
You had 20 people on you.

938
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,130
What do you want from us?

939
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:17,170
All we do is heal you!

940
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:29,810
Please live.

941
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:34,270
They're gonna use the Spider-Man ult after this!

942
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:40,410
Or that, too.

943
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,590
Ashley, fuck you.

944
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:47,550
Ashley!

945
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:52,170
Okay, you gotta admit...

946
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,290
No!

947
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,420
I did something so fucking cool.

948
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:01,980
I...

949
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,820
Oh my God.

950
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:15,220
I did something so fucking cool just for it to be negated by a stupid magician.

951
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,500
I'm okay.

952
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:21,860
I love...

953
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,300
I love this game.

954
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:31,780
I love Marvel Rivals.

955
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:33,300
It's my...

956
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,260
It's my favorite game of the year.

957
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,920
This is honestly game of the year for me.

958
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,540
Oh my God, I can't.

959
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,460
I have to wait.

960
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,760
Where is he?

961
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,460
I have to wait for 20 things!

962
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,760
Okay, there we go.

963
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,440
Yes.

964
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:51,780
Alright.

965
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,000
We're fine.

966
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:55,680
We're fine.

967
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:56,420
Oh, you're right.

968
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:57,300
You're right.

969
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,880
I'm definitely dead inside now.

970
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,240
Alright, give me a sec.

971
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,920
Let me do a magic trick, too.

972
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,840
I'll be like Dr. Strange, guys.

973
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,720
Wait, where is it?

974
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,000
Alright.

975
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,880
I gotta make sure I also grab...

976
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,700
Okay, I'll do a magic trick as well.

977
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:16,760
This is so cool.

978
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,860
Alright, where is it?

979
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,800
I like how day two, my optimism is gone.

980
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:34,860
My joy and optimism is now gone.

981
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,740
It only took one day.

982
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,120
It took one day.

983
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,560
If you watch like...

984
01:05:53,700 --> 01:06:01,760
If you watch like yesterday's stream versus today's stream, you can tell it's a different...

985
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,860
You can tell I'm a different person now compared to yesterday.

986
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,540
It only takes one bad day.

987
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,040
That's all it took.

988
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:21,480
Her smile, her optimism gone forever.

989
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,760
One really, really fucking bad day.

990
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,580
I'm back in my Overwatch days.

991
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:37,700
My Overwatch fucking game mindset.

992
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,300
Oh my god, it's him.

993
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,880
It's him, please.

994
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:53,000
If you don't punish this fucker, I swear to god.

995
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,130
I swear to god.

996
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:06,110
If he gets to do all that for free, I swear to fucking god, I'm gonna be so...

997
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:08,730
Oh my god!

998
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,450
It's not fair!

999
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:15,150
The Venom actually has a buddy to do all that with!

1000
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:21,230
He gets a Black Panther to dive with him!

1001
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,550
He's being enabled!

1002
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,820
It's okay.

1003
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,580
It's just another day.

1004
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,180
Another day on the grind.

1005
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:40,150
Just another day on the grind.

1006
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:50,670
I'm like worried about like...

1007
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:52,310
Jesus.

1008
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:53,550
Okay, it's fine.

1009
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:56,310
It's fine.

1010
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:57,130
Everything is fine.

1011
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:01,370
As long as I don't get dived, it's fine.

1012
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,320
We live.

1013
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:11,720
Let's just live.

1014
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:12,760
You know what?

1015
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,740
I just... Oh my god!

1016
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,220
Alright.

1017
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,640
You're all okay though, right?

1018
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,580
Are you guys all okay?

1019
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,080
Cause I'm not.

1020
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:28,950
I'm not okay.

1021
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:32,550
I was not though.

1022
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:34,830
Yeah, that was a Jeff.

1023
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,310
I don't understand.

1024
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:46,970
I avoided him thinking like, oh my god.

1025
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,230
He was so fucking... He was trolling there.

1026
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:55,050
But like, now he has a... Now he's not?

1027
01:08:56,090 --> 01:09:00,010
Why couldn't he do this for me?

1028
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:08,050
Why couldn't he play like that on my team?

1029
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,330
Wait, they hit nobody?

1030
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:20,510
Oh my god!

1031
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:22,740
No!

1032
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,200
Guys, you're right.

1033
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,860
I only took him two games to lock in.

1034
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,740
Okay, this Black Panther is really fucking good though.

1035
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,980
He's so annoying.

1036
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,400
Nah, I hate Panthers too.

1037
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,000
Oh my god, please don't die.

1038
01:09:59,120 --> 01:09:59,660
Please don't die.

1039
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,260
Please don't die.

1040
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:00,840
Please don't die.

1041
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,440
Please don't die.

1042
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,020
Please don't die.

1043
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:02,940
Please don't die.

1044
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:03,700
Please don't die.

1045
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,980
That's all I ask for you.

1046
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:05,640
Please don't die.

1047
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,180
I'm ready to put on a show!

1048
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:08,640
I'm ready too!

1049
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,780
Dance off.

1050
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,520
Dance off.

1051
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,400
Dance off.

1052
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,320
Yippee!

1053
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,220
Dance off!

1054
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,240
Alright, it's fine.

1055
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:33,070
Guys, I can feel a Jeff ult coming in.

1056
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,290
Oh, I feel it.

1057
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:36,710
I'm ready for it.

1058
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:38,010
Nom, nom, nom, nom!

1059
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:39,690
Nom, nom, nom, nom!

1060
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:42,670
Nom, nom, nom, nom!

1061
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:50,700
I have to put this on a tank because like, our tanks take way too much fucking damage.

1062
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,160
Om nom, nom, nom, nom!

1063
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,260
Oh, thank god!

1064
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:55,020
Fuck you!

1065
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:56,360
Don't

1066
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:00,090
die!

1067
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:02,630
No!

1068
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:03,910
I'm sorry!

1069
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,190
I wish you were here!

1070
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,610
I'm sorry for laughing!

1071
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:15,990
Now I don't have the heals!

1072
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:22,910
I'm sorry!

1073
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:32,750
Because I was like, he got nom, nom, nom, and then Venom was like, she has no support partner now.

1074
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:35,190
And then everything went downhill.

1075
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,110
My turn!

1076
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:50,630
My turn!

1077
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:53,710
Yippee!

1078
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:54,510
My turn!

1079
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,030
Yippee!

1080
01:11:58,430 --> 01:11:59,130
Get over here.

1081
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,410
Oh wait, shit.

1082
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:01,390
Oh no!

1083
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,550
I was joking!

1084
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:03,430
Don't come back!

1085
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:06,210
But not now!

1086
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:11,250
Nice.

1087
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,930
Oh my god, we pulled it back.

1088
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,370
He actually got over!

1089
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,750
He actually got over here!

1090
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,470
Who would've fucking thought?

1091
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,190
Yeah, it's whoever ults second, yeah.

1092
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,670
I waited a little bit.

1093
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:43,330
I didn't like, instantly Luna ult when I heard hers, because like, if my team's okay, then I don't have to Luna ult.

1094
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:48,230
I just waited until I saw somebody low, and then I Luna ulted.

1095
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,710
Because I was like, okay then, then like, we need it then.

1096
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:56,310
Because then I'm like, okay, they're obviously gonna use aggression ults after the Luna ult.

1097
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:01,930
But, if I wait until, if we kill them in time, before they use their aggression ults, then we'll be fine.

1098
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,750
Yeah, I'm a filthy support main.

1099
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:15,530
Just like, I just wanted to go through my Overwatch days.

1100
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:20,410
Also, being a DPS player or tank player is way too stressful.

1101
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,970
Versus support.

1102
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:26,290
IMO.

1103
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:29,330
So, I think playing DPS is way too stressful.

1104
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:40,370
Woah!

1105
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:45,050
I don't feel so good!

1106
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:51,950
No, because like, DPS, you have to manage your heals too.

1107
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:57,410
Like, you have to play around health packs, but a lot of supports can heal themselves.

1108
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:07,930
So like, or the support duo will insta-heal him back, so like, I don't have to worry about like, you know, lack of healing on myself.

1109
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:13,350
But playing DPS, you always have to like, remember where- Oh my god.

1110
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:14,130
Oh my god.

1111
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,190
Oh, he hit the fucking wall.

1112
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,870
That's- I'm such a loser.

1113
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:20,490
I'm so bad.

1114
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:24,770
Oh, hello.

1115
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:28,970
He's still contesting us.

1116
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,010
Oh!

1117
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:35,190
I do love.

1118
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,290
Nope.

1119
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:46,390
Nice.

1120
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:47,570
Not nice.

1121
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:49,590
Not nice.

1122
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,870
Oh wait, oh my god!

1123
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:55,030
Holy shit!

1124
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,170
He's got that wolf in him.

1125
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:05,070
I just- Okay, you're fine.

1126
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,200
It's okay, he's fine.

1127
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:14,700
You're fine too.

1128
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,000
Oh my god, you're all so fucking healthy.

1129
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,660
Man, there's a guy over there.

1130
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:22,840
Ooh!

1131
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,180
Nice.

1132
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,520
I feel like a lot of games is a sad- Like, you know.

1133
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:42,260
You know when like, you can't kill anybody as DPS, it's sadder.

1134
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,860
It's sadder than like, you know, losing cause you're a support.

1135
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,480
Cause when you- When DPS lose, we all know why we lost.

1136
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,760
Stairs at DPS.

1137
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:54,900
Or tank.

1138
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,840
Stairs at DPS or tank.

1139
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,200
We all know.

1140
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:58,800
We all know.

1141
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,660
But like, as a support, you're just like, whoops!

1142
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,040
What could I have done?

1143
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,880
Like, my team was just bad.

1144
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:19,900
I can blame the team more easily as it- What the fuck!

1145
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:20,960
As a support.

1146
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,950
Alright.

1147
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:34,210
Ooh, this is halfway.

1148
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,050
Oh, shit!

1149
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:41,730
He went full-on!

1150
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,250
He went in a full-on panther mode!

1151
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:49,650
Oh, and then- And then SK... SK went too wild.

1152
01:16:59,320 --> 01:16:59,760
Oh!

1153
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,000
It dropped into everything!

1154
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:05,980
Okay.

1155
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,600
I don't have to use ult.

1156
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,160
I gotta hold my ult until their Luna uses ult.

1157
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,680
I didn't think he would fucking go back!

1158
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,220
Oh, no!

1159
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:41,900
I couldn't ult!

1160
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,380
I'm coming back!

1161
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,260
Live!

1162
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:53,190
I'm ready!

1163
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:56,790
Get on board and I'll start dancing!

1164
01:17:58,890 --> 01:17:59,430
Yeah!

1165
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:02,730
And again!

1166
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:06,890
And again!

1167
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:10,790
Yay!

1168
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,510
I got my own stage to dance!

1169
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:21,650
Yay, we won!

1170
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,160
Oh, my god.

1171
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:30,620
I don't know.

1172
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:42,380
I think also for me, I'm so comfortable playing support that like for me, I'm so comfortable playing support that it's not that stressful versus DPS and tank.

1173
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:48,880
Because, like I said, like, you know, I don't play DPS and tank that often.

1174
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:51,600
Like, I know I play DPS for Apex and stuff, but that's different.

1175
01:18:51,840 --> 01:19:00,840
Apex is so different from like actually playing DPS, but when I'm playing DPS or yeah, I know, 9800.

1176
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,560
Like, god hates me.

1177
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,940
It's just like so stressful.

1178
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:08,820
Because I'm not used to it.

1179
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,160
And it tilts me even more because like I play support.

1180
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:20,040
And then when I know I can tell when we have a very bad support player.

1181
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:25,120
So it tilts me even more because I'm like I'm just like

1182
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,200
If I was on support right now.

1183
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,180
Things would be different.

1184
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:48,820
So, yeah, in my head I always be like I could do a better job than this fucker.

1185
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,220
And it makes me want to queue support.

1186
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:55,860
Because I'm like, I need to queue support to be like to show people how good support play like.

1187
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,620
So it's just, oh, it's like that shit.

1188
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:04,980
I like a mental warfare in my head every time I try to try to do like DPS your tank.

1189
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,620
And then like I hate tank.

1190
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:10,980
I'll never touch tank.

1191
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,340
Anyone that's a tank player you actually enjoy pain.

1192
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:15,280
I'm sorry.

1193
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:21,780
Like I feel like I feel like being a tank player, being a tank main is like no fun.

1194
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,140
You guys actually enjoy pain.

1195
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,540
Like you're an M right there.

1196
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:51,520
Because it's like because it's like as a tank player, you have to rely so much on your teammates to do something.

1197
01:20:51,800 --> 01:21:01,140
I mean same with support, but then like as a tank, you have to stare at the enemy while you're like, I hope my DPS does something.

1198
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:01,620
Like

1199
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:31,400
So that's why I feel like I don't know, I don't know when I try to play tank, I'm just like oh my god, I slap and then it just does like one damage and I'm like oh Oh Unless you find a fucking lone support support player by themselves in the wild that's really it.

1200
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:41,900
If you find a support, if you find a- just like how that venom kept fucking trying to fucking dive me every time Wait, what did SK say?

1201
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,640
Solo queue tank is a peak experience

1202
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:02,140
Top -notch team to win this one I'm Luna Snow.

1203
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:07,120
Like the moon I shine in darkness Oh

1204
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,300
Do it

1205
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:24,620
She wouldn't do it She wouldn't fucking do it I know, she's weak

1206
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:31,750
Oh yeah, especially when you're a solo queue tank.

1207
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:35,550
I think also No, no, no Surefour, no

1208
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:41,050
Stop, he's gonna curse my queues I can feel it.

1209
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:49,870
Surefour, we got you, but like Surefour, we already we got you but like American

1210
01:22:53,910 --> 01:23:00,170
Hahahahaha This could've been you, you could've been in this trio queue

01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:24,120
Okay, I had to make sure there was no fucking stupid mines Oh Goodbye

1212
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:32,630

1225

Oh my god This Thor is insane Now you guys are gonna be like See, see a good, that's See, a tank can do stuff Yeah, now look at our tank Our tank is not having fun You didn't say that But what about our tanks Our tanks was having the worst day of their lives

1226
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:37,840
Maybe one of the tank is having fun But our tank was definitely not having fun Time to switch things up Including which side you're on Some tanks can't have fun

1227
01:27:50,710 --> 01:28:15,310
He is the son of Odin That was a portal I don't think it was a portal issue I was like if we all walked, if we couldn't get past that thing, I don't think even if we get the point, our team was gonna be okay after that I don't think our team was gonna be okay Like,

1228
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:17,730
if we had issues just trying to get to point

1229
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,640
Why only play Luna?

1230
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:52,960
Cause Luna's good She's like S tier You always need a Luna Yeah, I need Luna, Mantis Luna, Mantis Cloak and Dagger I heard like if you know how to play Rocket really well, then he's also really good For like healing wise But only if you're really good at like bouncing his shots off Bouncing his shots off things

1231
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:08,340
Yeah, but you have to be able to understand the angles on where things are I can play Mantis now, but like, I feel like Oh, there's a portal Why can't we do that?

1232
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:22,130
What's going on?

1233
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:23,410
Oh my god!

1234
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,320

1235
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:40,750

Guys, please Please, you guys are taking way too much damage for me I'm getting scared, guys Guys!

1237
01:29:53,630 --> 01:30:03,970

1238
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:35,510
It's alright I know it's not my fault No, that guy deserved it He was No, he was gaming No, he was gaming No, he deserved it He knew what the fuck he was doing I blame Surefour He came in here, threw a curse on me and then it was downhill

1239
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:45,810
It all went downhill after that Everything was gonna be fine until he threw that fucking curse

1240
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:59,430
So, honestly Things could've been better Things definitely could've been better

1241
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:06,910
That's good, this is where things change, right?

1242
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:12,800
Things will be different now Right?

1243
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:19,900
Right here, right now Things will be different Is Jazzy?

What was wrong with Jazzy?

1245
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:29,200
I have so much hate in me that like, there's no singular hate anymore You guys gotta be very specific

1246
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:38,260
You guys have to be very fucking specific

1247
01:31:55,980 --> 01:32:01,300

1257
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:45,660
Like, it's just so inefficient

1258
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:54,930
It's so dumb It's actually so fucking dumb

1259
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:01,070
What's going on?

1260
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:03,810
What's going on?

1261
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:06,770
What's going on guys?

1262
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:08,450
Hey guys, are you all okay?

1263
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:09,990

01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:17,190
Oh my god Oh my god, bro Okay, you guys had to back up there

Oh, that's our portal It's like, where the fuck Oh Oh, goodbye Unless

1268
01:34:52,600 --> 01:35:01,360

1269
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:16,820
It's fine Everything is fine We're all alive and healthy Oh, except for that guy But like, we didn't care about that guy anyway, right?

1270
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:24,660
He didn't matter in the grand scheme of things Nobody even remembers his name

1271
01:35:31,570 --> 01:35:33,710
Oh, she's gonna start dancing

1272
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,480
It's fine

1273
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:56,900
Oh my god, not another one Guys Please Ping me so I can heal

1274
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:05,980
No Live

1275
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,170
It's okay, we're just giving them a little space

1276
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:23,650
But like That was

1277
01:36:40,950 --> 01:37:13,950
actually an insane portal But he didn't kill me He forgot about me That's right, fucker Should've killed the fucking support That's Ashe's Oh my god, people are getting too good at this game, guys I need to get top 500 before people learn everything I don't have enough time to fucking learn all these tech This guy already learned the fucking Doctor Strange tech

1278
01:37:18,910 --> 01:37:28,090
This is why I'm trying to speedrun it on stream, so I don't have to worry about everybody learning like 200,000 things

1279
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:52,420
I've never seen that portal tech though but it's actually so fucking smart Don't hear that, Tyler I will, I will just not now

1280
01:37:57,650 --> 01:38:05,830
There has to be like a lot of tech that I don't know from Luna Has it not been?

1281
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:10,790
It's fine, it's fine I got you

1282
01:38:14,590 --> 01:38:15,190
100 like

1283
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:22,850
You're fine, you're so healthy Oh, your shield's gone No!

1284
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:41,350
I heard the crack I heard the crack and I knew it was over I heard that and I'm like, goodbye, Covey Goodbye, Covey I vaulted for the last fight which is good

01:38:48,810 --> 01:39:06,430
Okay, not yet though Alright, now I vault There we go Kill him, kill him Oh, okay, don't worry That's fine, you can use this to kill him though We're stuck here now We're stuck in this stupid fucking map

1286
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:42,610
Guys, it's not toxic relationship, he's better This is a healthy relationship Guys There's nothing toxic about it He's different My revivals is different He's third person and there's no role queue and voice chat's broken and and yesterday I lost like 15 games 15 games

1287
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:47,090
And...

1288
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:48,570
and there's no regen.

1289
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:50,810
So he's different.

1290
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:58,910
And there's six of us.

1291
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:02,730
But like...

1292
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:04,490
Like guys, you don't understand.

1293
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:05,510
It's not toxic.

1294
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:10,390
It's not toxic.

1295
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:15,590
I'm having... I'm having so much fun... right now.

1296
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:34,110
Guys, this is... this is so fun.

1297
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:34,830
I'm safe.

1298
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,480
Oh my god, please!

1299
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,580
Google Maps faster!

1300
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:57,740
That's fine.

1301
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:58,860
I'm healing here.

1302
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:01,860
What's going on on my screen right now?

1303
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:02,800
I can't tell.

1304
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,560
There's a lot of things going on on my screen.

1305
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:12,190
That's fine.

1306
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:13,870
We're keeping... keep each other safe.

1307
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:14,790
Keep yourself safe.

1308
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,780
What the fuck is going down here in this corner?

1309
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:35,840
Whoa!

1310
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:52,030
I said that... I wrote to Surefour.

1311
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:56,710
I was like... I was like haha, noob down.

1312
01:41:57,350 --> 01:42:00,030
And he said, keep yourself safe.

1313
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:01,730
I wonder what he means by that.

1314
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:06,370
That flank was crazy though.

1315
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:07,310
I don't think it was a flank.

1316
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:08,730
I think they just came back from spawn.

1317
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:16,250
That's crazy.

1318
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:23,210
So, that's when you know he plays League.

1319
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:29,850
He says that in League, because if you say anything bad in League of Legends, you get like instantly banned.

1320
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:32,010
Which makes sense, you know?

1321
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:38,330
Because like, League has like the... League has like the most intense reporting system.

1322
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,320
Oh my god, that was such a good eye.

1323
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,540
That was such a good web.

1324
01:42:54,690 --> 01:42:58,470
People keep asking me to... Oh my god!

1325
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:02,710
He died so fucking fast.

1326
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:13,340
Can he?

1327
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:15,320
Ah, I didn't reload my hands!

1328
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:16,020
I'm sorry!

1329
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:18,520
My hands are very limited!

1330
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,620
It's fine, we're fine.

1331
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:34,440
I don't... I don't want to watch Arcane, because like, I'm too scared that's going to make me want to play League.

1332
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:39,640
I feel like... I don't think I need that in my life.

1333
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:51,860
Because like, everybody who watched Arcane kept getting... went back to League.

1334
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:55,340
Or like, started League, playing League because of Arcane.

1335
01:43:55,780 --> 01:43:58,140
And I'm just thinking, I don't want to play League.

1336
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:02,880
I really, really don't want to play League!

1337
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:11,620
I'm worried it's going to like... I'll be like, oh my god, maybe League... maybe League's not that bad.

1338
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:14,520
Maybe it won't be that bad.

1339
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:16,040
But that's how they get you.

1340
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,200
That's how they fucking get you.

1341
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:24,400
They know.

1342
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:27,200
Toki knows.

1343
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:33,020
If we shoot her, she'll die.

1344
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,160
Oh my god, nevermind.

1345
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,060
Well, I mean, technically she did not die.

1346
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:44,930
Oh, maybe I die.

1347
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:49,150
Unless...

1348
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:49,730
I'm okay.

1349
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,300
Yeah, because League is coming back now.

1350
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:00,500
People are playing League again.

1351
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:03,940
Because Arcane's doing really well.

1352
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:06,420
Season 2 Arcane was apparently really, really, really good.

1353
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:09,080
And I'm like, oh.

1354
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:12,460
Oh, I walked into her!

1355
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:14,620
I was like, she'll go forward, right?

1356
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:16,000
But she went backwards.

1357
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,600
That's fucked.

1358
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:20,960
She actually went backwards.

1359
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,480
I'm coming back.

1360
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:29,880
I'm coming back.

1361
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,040
No!

1362
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,360
Oh, no!

1363
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:38,430
I'm okay.

1364
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:40,770
That's how they get you.

1365
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:53,420
Guys, you need to be faster in your Google Maps, man.

1366
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,540
That could have been a fight right there.

1367
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:57,640
We could have had a fight right there.

1368
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:13,930
Where am I?

1369
01:46:21,850 --> 01:46:23,170
Oh, she's one!

1370
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:23,910
Okay, nice.

1371
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:27,990
That was an insane ice shot though.

1372
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:30,830
Holy fuck!

1373
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:36,610
That ice shot was fucking crazy.

1374
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:43,260
Yay!

1375
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:44,520
Oh my god, please.

1376
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,160
Please get me in a plat one.

1377
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:47,640
Please.

1378
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,780
We just need one more win and I'll be plat one.

1379
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,960
And then we need four wins and I'll be diamond three!

1380
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:01,640
Oh, wait!

1381
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:02,720
No, I was amped!

1382
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:03,860
Yay!

1383
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:06,140
Oh my god, okay.

1384
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:13,380
Okay, we need 40 and then 55, 67, 89.

1385
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:14,740
Okay, we need three wins.

1386
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,640
I need three wins.

1387
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:22,520
Three wins and then I'll be top 500.

1388
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:26,540
Top 500, please pray for me.

1389
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,140
We're back!

1390
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,200
We're back in three wins hell!

1391
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,940
We're back!

1392
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:40,020
We just need... Guys, please pray for me, guys.

1393
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:45,440
Please, put your hands in the air, give me your energy and pray for me.

1394
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:48,740
We're back to three wins!

1395
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,440
We're back to three wins!

1396
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:54,820
It's time.

1397
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,620
We're gonna break the cycle.

1398
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:59,080
The cycle ends with me!

1399
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,540
This is it!

1400
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,980
We're gonna be here for it!

1401
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:14,260
Alright, if we do... If we have one win left, I'm gonna get in a call with him and I'm gonna try so fucking hard.

1402
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:26,080
I'm gonna start comming in the moment we're at one win.

1403
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:32,140
Oh my god, break the cycle!

1404
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,500
Break the curse!

1405
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:37,140
This curse only lasted one game!

1406
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:41,020
It's gonna be different!

1407
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:50,370
It's fine.

1408
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:51,490
I'm fine.

1409
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:53,690
I'm fine, everybody.

1410
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:55,110
I love Marvel Rivals.

1411
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:58,190
I just wanted you guys to know.

1412
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:04,870
In other games, I never had like an instance where I won it.

1413
01:49:06,010 --> 01:49:08,290
Even in Overwatch, you know.

1414
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:15,030
You know, the thing is, Overwatch didn't have like animals where I'm like, oh I guess hamsters.

1415
01:49:15,430 --> 01:49:24,070
But like, you know, with Hammond and Winston, you know, you know, I'm fucking... I don't like it when Winston like dives at me as a support.

1416
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:28,410
I wouldn't be go out to be like, you know what, good thing they shot a Harambe.

1417
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:29,430
I wouldn't say that.

1418
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:31,750
I was like, oh my god, how could they do that?

1419
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:51,410
But like, for some reason, in Marvel Rivals, I'm like, I wouldn't go outside and like fucking... I want to go outside and fucking burn a tree down.

1420
01:49:55,570 --> 01:50:06,170
There's just something about this game that makes me like... No, it hasn't done this to me for in Overwatch.

1421
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:09,510
I never felt this fucking hate in me before.

1422
01:50:09,530 --> 01:50:14,830
I never felt this hate before.

1423
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:18,930
There's just something about Marvel Rivals that's different.

1424
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:27,310
I think, you know... Oh, I know why.

1425
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:28,690
No, I know why now.

1426
01:50:28,890 --> 01:50:29,570
You know why?

1427
01:50:29,870 --> 01:50:35,010
Because, you know, when Winston fucking jumps at you, he doesn't say, I am Groot.

1428
01:50:35,310 --> 01:50:36,250
I am Groot.

1429
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:38,130
I am Groot.

1430
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:49,270
When you hear that for like, you know, the fucking 50th time while he's fucking on your ass.

1431
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:52,830
Like, it starts getting to you.

1432
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:57,650
Like, Winston doesn't go, I am Winston.

1433
01:50:58,370 --> 01:51:00,070
I am Winston.

1434
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:10,070
Because like, you know, you hear different things.

1435
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:15,450
But for this game, you just hear one line.

1436
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:27,850
You know, and then like... And then like, you know, Roadhog, yeah, you're gonna say like, oh yeah, but what about Roadhog?

1437
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:33,010
Oh my god, I'm fucking gonna stay down here.

1438
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:36,370
Oh no, it's fucking Groot.

1439
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:42,470
Oh, fuck you.

1440
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:48,910
If you say I am Groot to me one more time, you say, say I am Groot.

1441
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:51,430
Also like, Roadhog.

1442
01:51:51,850 --> 01:52:07,210
In Roadhog, you know, you could be like, well, Roadhog's like Spider-Man, you know, like, you know, not, okay, no, actually, yeah, but like, the thing is, or like Doomfist, like, I don't know, like, you say like, Spider-Man is like, is like Doomfist, but like,

1443
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:30,790
but like, you know, after like, Doomfist punches you, he doesn't fucking do 320, 320 somersaults in the air, and then fucking have 800 DP, like, not a thousand, not even a thousand, 30,000, 30,000 DPI, 50 million cents, and then you see him in the air fucking,

1444
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:32,150
and we're like, rawr!

1445
01:52:32,970 --> 01:52:36,050
And I'm just, like, I even hate fucking him.

1446
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:38,950
Like, he's not, he's not even as bad as Genji too.

1447
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:40,610
Like, Genji was fucking bad.

1448
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:42,530
Like, Genji wasn't as bad as this.

1449
01:52:45,670 --> 01:52:48,930
Like, like, Genji was not as bad as this too.

1450
01:52:49,410 --> 01:52:50,370
Oh my god.

1451
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:52,210
You know what, I think we can win this.

1452
01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:54,130
I think we can win this.

1453
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:59,210
I'm sorry, I chose the tank.

1454
01:53:14,370 --> 01:53:25,690
All right, but then, like, the thing is, like, like, yeah, so like, Doomfist, when he runs away after he tries to kill you, it's like, it's like, you can see him.

1455
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:27,070
You can at least see him.

1456
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:40,450
When Spiderman does it, he does, like, nine degrees angle flips, and then, like, flips, and he chooses all the angles that's possible in the fucking world to run away.

1457
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:47,050
Okay.

1458
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:50,690
I don't think she's okay.

1459
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:56,790
Like, what the fuck happened to that Luna Snow?

1460
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:09,370
It's fine, we're fine.

1461
01:54:09,370 --> 01:54:11,090
I wish I could do what you do.

1462
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:15,310
Nice.

1463
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:21,770
It's just very tilting, watching a Spiderman, trying to think he's him.

1464
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:24,490
He's a public menace.

1465
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:27,410
Now I know how the newspaper guy felt.

1466
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:29,850
He was right.

1467
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:32,850
I want pictures of Spiderman right now.

1468
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:40,170
Someone give me pictures of Spiderman.

1469
01:54:40,330 --> 01:54:41,930
He was fucking right.

1470
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:46,670
JJonas was right.

1471
01:54:51,290 --> 01:54:53,950
That's a wild statement.

1472
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:58,730
Out of everything I said, that's the wildest statement?

1473
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:09,870
He's a menace to society.

1474
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:13,750
How do we know he's even a vigilante?

1475
01:55:14,910 --> 01:55:17,050
What if he- what if it was all planned?

1476
01:55:20,410 --> 01:55:25,230
What if it was all, like, orchestrated, you know?

1477
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:27,210
He paved- he paved them.

1478
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:28,710
He paved them.

1479
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:36,130
I'm gonna win this.

1480
01:55:43,810 --> 01:55:46,370
He paid them to make himself look good.

1481
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:49,570
I bet, like- oh my god, he fucking died.

1482
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:55,830
Alright, you guys ready to dance?

1483
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:57,770
That's right.

1484
01:55:58,070 --> 01:55:59,570
I waited for that tip.

1485
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:03,290
Okay, maybe Okay, now you should be fine.

1486
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:05,710
He's fake.

1487
01:56:05,890 --> 01:56:06,730
I can tell.

1488
01:56:08,930 --> 01:56:09,890
You don't know that.

1489
01:56:10,070 --> 01:56:11,050
You don't know Spiderman has no money.

1490
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:12,250
Maybe he's some rich boy.

1491
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:17,570
Yeah, I bet that's fake news made up by Spiderman.

1492
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:20,050
Who's Peter Parker?

1493
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:24,350
Who is he?

1494
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:28,870
What's his full name and address so I can send it over to that newspaper company?

1495
01:56:34,150 --> 01:56:41,770
Give me his full name and address right now, where he lives, and then direct it to J.

1496
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:43,290
Jonas Jameson.

1497
01:56:44,830 --> 01:56:49,410
And then mix- and then- and then so I can call the cops.

1498
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:56,530
Fucking call the cops on Spiderman, on Peter Parker.

1499
01:57:00,650 --> 01:57:01,930
I'll throw my thing down and get there.

1500
01:57:02,010 --> 01:57:02,630
I'll get your arm, okay?

1501
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:07,910
Ducky, no!

1502
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:10,150
No, Ducky!

1503
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:14,910
Give me Spiderman right now!

1504
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:20,650
Ducky, don't be a snitch!

1505
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,630
And that's why I hate Spiderman.

1506
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:30,590
What's wrong with you?

1507
01:57:31,590 --> 01:57:40,730
If you play support and you have to deal with this fucker, you know what- Bro, all the fucking support players that have to deal with Spiderman would agree with me.

1508
01:57:41,690 --> 01:57:44,730
You guys are- you guys are just get to play frontline.

1509
01:57:45,310 --> 01:57:47,630
You guys are not the backline players.

1510
01:57:52,890 --> 01:57:53,950
You don't understand.

1511
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:59,650
I'm gonna start a petition with all the other support players.

1512
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:03,530
To fucking get him doxxed by Spiderman.

1513
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:11,650
He is a public menace.

1514
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:14,630
We have to doxx him for the safety of the community.

1515
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,140
There we go.

1516
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:29,120
Support players, support group.

1517
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:34,580
I think you started to sound like Eggman.

1518
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:40,740
Oh shit, sorry, I was- sorry, I was thinking about how much I'm gonna fucking squish a spider after that.

1519
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:48,300
He's not even in my game, but I still hate him.

1520
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:50,960
He doesn't have to be in my game for me to hate.

1521
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:57,920
The mere thought of him just makes me go fucking feral.

1522
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:02,800
The average support player.

1523
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:10,580
What the fu- oh my god, I chose the wrong side.

1524
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,020
Where did he fucking come from?

1525
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:22,240
Oh, I bet- I bet it's because I said I was gonna fucking doxx stupid Iron Man, stupid Tony Stark.

1526
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:24,400
Protecting a criminal.

1527
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,440
Of course he'll protect a fucking criminal.

1528
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:35,620
We all know he's a fucking criminal too.

1529
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,660
We all- we all-

1530
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:48,160
Get him a fucking cancel Iron Man.

1531
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:06,120
Yeah, I bet you Iron Man evades taxes.

1532
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:16,660
That's right, get down, tax evader.

1533
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:20,620
Are you okay?

1534
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:28,400
My arrivals has changed me, guys.

1535
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:34,660
That's right, Iron Man.

1536
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:37,620
Pay your fucking taxes, Tony Stark.

1537
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:42,460
Oh shit, I didn't hear that!

1538
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:56,800
Okay, I may- I trolled a little bit, I didn't hear- no wonder everybody went like right- left side instead of right.

1539
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:58,420
I was so confused.

1540
02:00:59,060 --> 02:01:01,720
I was like, why did people go- went that way?

1541
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:04,460
Yeah, they're only one push against us.

1542
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:08,140
Oh, they're so excited when they see this.

1543
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:11,160
I'd like to die for this.

1544
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,120
I can't anymore, actually.

1545
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:15,840
Oh.

1546
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:22,970
Oh,

1547
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:28,590
he's one!

1548
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:28,770
Oh, he's one!

1549
02:01:31,730 --> 02:01:33,510
Left side, right side.

1550
02:01:35,270 --> 02:01:40,730
Oh, just because I want someone to pay their taxes.

1551
02:01:41,950 --> 02:01:42,450
Insane.

1552
02:01:52,170 --> 02:01:57,650
Alright, I'll make sure- I'll make sure, like, some of these guys are alive.

1553
02:02:00,070 --> 02:02:01,430
Maximum AT!

1554
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:02,890
Okay!

1555
02:02:05,790 --> 02:02:07,010
You know what?

1556
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:09,710
Real firepower, let's go!

1557
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:11,750
You'll live.

1558
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:14,350
Where did you go?

1559
02:02:15,610 --> 02:02:17,270
You'll still live.

1560
02:02:19,530 --> 02:02:21,930
Oh, I thought he would go-

1561
02:02:25,690 --> 02:02:26,550
What?!

1562
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:31,100
Yeah, you're fine.

1563
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:34,840
Oh my, it's fine, it's fine.

1564
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:35,960
Rocket Raccoon lives.

1565
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:38,420
But Mag's like hard pushed.

1566
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:38,880
He's one.

1567
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:40,120
Mag is like super low.

1568
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:41,280
Alright, we're fine.

1569
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:44,280
Our man saved the universe?

1570
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:45,260
Freakiness.

1571
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:48,440
How do you know that he actually saved the universe?

1572
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:51,520
Guys, huh?

1573
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:54,820
How do you actually know?

1574
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:00,480
That's fucking right.

1575
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,380
Get on the cart, guys!

1576
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:09,640
You guys said it, but did you guys see it?

1577
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:14,280
Did you guys actually see him save the universe?

1578
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:20,640
He's guilty by association!

1579
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,100
He's protecting a criminal!

1580
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:28,980
Yeah, but that could be propaganda!

1581
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:31,220
He's a billionaire.

1582
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:32,960
He can afford it.

1583
02:03:33,700 --> 02:03:35,020
Yeah, were you there?

1584
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:48,800
It could've been like, filmed by a movie studio.

1585
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,500
Just like how they faked the moon landing.

1586
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:52,700
They could've faked it, like how they faked the moon landing.

1587
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:57,920
Just like how Tony Stark's dad faked the moon landing.

1588
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,420
Oh, fuck!

1589
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:12,200
Please kill her before she kills me!

1590
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:21,300
Oh, nice, nice.

1591
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,920
I'm coming back!

1592
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:33,020
Stark, you stop playing this game.

1593
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:38,280
I'm pretty sure Howard Stark faked the moon landing.

1594
02:04:39,060 --> 02:04:43,560
And Tony Stark faked saving the universe with the same movie studio.

1595
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:50,060
And that's just a theory, a dokey theory.

1596
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,520
Check out my column in the next newspaper on the mogul... what was it called?

1597
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,620
The newspaper company that fucking Jay Jameson ran?

1598
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:10,380
The Daily Bugle?

1599
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:14,780
Yeah, check out my column in the Daily Bugle next week.

1600
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:29,880
Of course!

1601
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:36,740
Of course, Jay Jameson, my oshi and my hero.

1602
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:40,640
I always read his newspaper every day.

1603
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:42,240
He knows what he's saying.

1604
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:44,440
I love his podcast too.

1605
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,680
His podcast is really good as well, guys.

1606
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:52,980
Check it out every morning.

1607
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:55,740
Especially when he tells me about how...

1608
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:03,840
About how the 5G waves are turning our spiders gay.

1609
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:16,040
Jay Jameson's podcast gets wild sometimes.

1610
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:24,980
Toki, please stop.

1611
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:28,600
I'm not real anymore.

1612
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:32,940
This is what Marvel Rivals has turned me into.

1613
02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:53,330
That's Jameson.

1614
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:54,350
That's Jay Jameson.

1615
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:56,250
I watch his podcast every morning.

1616
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:00,640
We're fine.

1617
02:07:01,220 --> 02:07:02,560
Okay, I should really lock in.

1618
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:04,620
I have not been locking in the last two games.

1619
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:10,120
Is it noticeable?

1620
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,700
Oh my god!

1621
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:17,900
Okay, there was no way I could save that.

1622
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:21,700
That was a lost cause.

1623
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:27,740
That was definitely a lost cause there.

1624
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:37,080
Hey guys, we're sort of stuck.

1625
02:07:37,260 --> 02:07:38,660
The supports are stuck down here.

1626
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:42,360
Alright, nice.

1627
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:47,160
Oh no, he's gruting.

1628
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:48,760
He's fucking gruting again.

1629
02:07:57,130 --> 02:07:58,050
It's fine.

1630
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:02,360
That's fine.

1631
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:06,280
It's not that fine, but it's fine.

1632
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:10,540
I'm gonna get arrowed right now to the fucking face.

1633
02:08:11,180 --> 02:08:13,580
I wish I was getting arrowed to the knee instead.

1634
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:22,700
At least I can survive a knee.

1635
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:26,480
Oh my god!

1636
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,880
I watched a man die in front of me.

1637
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:37,960
Everything is fine.

1638
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:39,200
Oh no, Jeff is here.

1639
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:42,660
I just noticed.

1640
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:44,680
I noticed the bubbles.

1641
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:46,640
Not the bubbles.

1642
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:49,980
Jeff is here.

1643
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,860
Oh my god, I didn't hit?

1644
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:57,800
No!

1645
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:01,980
Goodbye.

1646
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,880
Fucking three of us?

1647
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:08,180
I knew it.

1648
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,320
The moment I felt.

1649
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:12,600
I knew it.

1650
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:13,440
I knew it.

1651
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:14,560
This is targeted.

1652
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:17,960
Fuck, go in.

1653
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:18,420
Go in.

1654
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:19,200
I can... No!

1655
02:09:19,580 --> 02:09:20,780
I could've ulted!

1656
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:27,360
I think I'm just...

1657
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:29,120
I'm just gonna ult.

1658
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:30,920
If I hear Jeff, I'm fucking ulting.

1659
02:09:38,540 --> 02:09:39,620
They should bring me back.

1660
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:40,100
They should...

1661
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:45,180
Jaw should be a thing again.

1662
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,880
Fuck me.

1663
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:57,740
I'm healing.

1664
02:09:57,940 --> 02:09:59,440
I'm keeping you guys alive!

1665
02:10:00,620 --> 02:10:01,720
Jaws was right too.

1666
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:08,120
Nice.

1667
02:10:13,230 --> 02:10:14,410
Holy shit!

1668
02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:15,970
The freeze hook?

1669
02:10:16,030 --> 02:10:17,430
Oh, now that's hate.

1670
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:26,090
I still can't believe the very first thing they did with the models being datamined...

1671
02:10:27,050 --> 02:10:29,730
is to make hate animations about Jeff.

1672
02:10:29,730 --> 02:10:31,730
Which I fully support.

1673
02:10:38,190 --> 02:10:39,870
Hate triumphs.

1674
02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:41,030
Triumphs lust.

1675
02:10:47,650 --> 02:10:49,310
Hate is just stronger.

1676
02:10:49,510 --> 02:10:50,330
What can I say?

1677
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:55,770
Who's next?

1678
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:57,750
Honestly, he should be.

1679
02:11:00,190 --> 02:11:02,470
What the fuck happened?

1680
02:11:07,150 --> 02:11:08,890
Oh, nobody wants to shoot that?

1681
02:11:09,010 --> 02:11:09,670
That's fine.

1682
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:11,910
We don't have to.

1683
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:26,630
There's none of them using any ults that require me to ult as well.

1684
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:30,550
Alright.

1685
02:11:31,470 --> 02:11:32,430
We got rid of their ult.

1686
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:35,330
They literally used the I.

1687
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:38,450
I'm gonna use it when he goes yum yum yum.

1688
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:40,250
I'm using it when he goes yum yum yum.

1689
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:40,850
I'm gonna do it.

1690
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:45,730
Oh, okay.

1691
02:11:46,570 --> 02:11:47,870
Oh, that's fine.

1692
02:11:47,950 --> 02:11:49,450
The Hanzo just kills all of us.

1693
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:54,430
We're way too split for my ult though.

1694
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:55,310
That's the thing.

1695
02:11:55,430 --> 02:11:56,590
I can't use my ult!

1696
02:11:59,390 --> 02:12:01,690
Everybody was so split!

1697
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:08,960
What?!

1698
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:11,600
No!

1699
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:13,040
What?!

1700
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:15,340
I pressed Q!

1701
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:20,780
I actually pressed- It went off!

1702
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:25,960
What?!

1703
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:29,220
It went off on my screen!

1704
02:12:37,530 --> 02:12:38,850
Oh my god.

1705
02:12:38,910 --> 02:12:40,310
That's fucking crazy.

1706
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:42,950
That actually was so crazy.

1707
02:12:43,090 --> 02:12:44,790
It actually went off on my screen too.

1708
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:54,720
Yeah, I might have to ult here.

1709
02:13:01,610 --> 02:13:02,550
God, I hate you.

1710
02:13:03,790 --> 02:13:04,790
I hate you.

1711
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:14,800
Don't worry!

1712
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:16,020
Oh, you're fine.

1713
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:16,780
You are fine.

1714
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:17,660
Okay, nevermind.

1715
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:18,260
Go!

1716
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:19,900
Go in there and kill him!

1717
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,100
Alright, that's fine.

1718
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:28,500
We're fine.

1719
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:30,820
We're so healthy.

1720
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:36,060
It's just me.

1721
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:38,880
It actually was just me.

1722
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:41,860
What's wrong with you?

1723
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:44,320
What's fucking- What is wrong with you?!

1724
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:47,460
I have a mantis!

1725
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:50,060
There were three people together!

1726
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:52,320
What is wrong with you?!

1727
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:10,660
That's so fucked up.

1728
02:14:14,290 --> 02:14:16,690
That's actually so fucked up.

1729
02:14:17,050 --> 02:14:20,970
That's actually- Oh my god.

1730
02:14:21,370 --> 02:14:23,570
Now you know why I hate sharks!

1731
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:30,830
My hate is justified.

1732
02:14:35,930 --> 02:14:38,030
My hate is so justified.

1733
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:45,490
We can win.

1734
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:46,170
We can win.

1735
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:56,670
I have ult.

1736
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:58,350
They have ult too.

1737
02:15:04,700 --> 02:15:05,360
No!

1738
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:16,240
Get me out of this fucking world!

1739
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:20,400
Okay, I'm coming back.

1740
02:15:20,660 --> 02:15:21,620
I'm coming back.

1741
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:24,080
I'm ready to fucking dance!

1742
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:29,060
Oh, he's gonna eat you, but I'm free.

1743
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:30,880
I'm sorry, bro.

1744
02:15:33,660 --> 02:15:35,140
I'm still here, though.

1745
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:48,670
We live for as long as we can.

1746
02:15:50,590 --> 02:15:54,990
I live for as long as I can, so does our mantis.

1747
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:14,460
Oh my god, the Jeff.

1748
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:17,640
At least I wasn't in the Jeff ult, guys.

1749
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:20,820
Guys, I wasn't in the Jeff ult.

1750
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:29,160
At least I wasn't in it!

1751
02:16:33,150 --> 02:16:34,450
That's all that matters.

1752
02:16:34,830 --> 02:16:35,950
I wasn't part of it.

1753
02:16:38,530 --> 02:16:40,350
Don't be mean to Jeff.

1754
02:16:41,810 --> 02:16:43,410
Oh, I might get banned.

1755
02:16:43,830 --> 02:16:48,050
I hope Jeff has a very good day.

1756
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:51,710
It's okay if they count half those points because of Jeff ults.

1757
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:54,330
You can't do that on stream.

1758
02:17:03,090 --> 02:17:05,370
I don't want to actually get banned.

1759
02:17:11,410 --> 02:17:14,210
I'm not mad.

1760
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:14,750
I swear.

1761
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,220
Toxic positivity, guys.

1762
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:32,380
Oh, what's she doing here?

1763
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:33,820
She's just gonna walk out like that?

1764
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:41,760
She's just gonna walk out like that?

1765
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:43,180
Crazy.

1766
02:17:56,250 --> 02:17:59,490
There's like... there's like a fucking hella right there.

1767
02:17:59,570 --> 02:18:00,570
Oh my god.

1768
02:18:07,310 --> 02:18:11,110
We gotta focus up.

1769
02:18:14,250 --> 02:18:14,850
No.

1770
02:18:17,610 --> 02:18:19,030
It's fine, it's fine.

1771
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:19,490
We're fine.

1772
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:20,010
Nice!

1773
02:18:21,770 --> 02:18:22,490
Kill him!

1774
02:18:23,370 --> 02:18:24,050
Kill him!

1775
02:18:24,810 --> 02:18:26,870
He's a washed surgeon anyway.

1776
02:18:27,030 --> 02:18:28,990
He can't even fucking perform surgery anymore.

1777
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:32,870
He lost his worth in society.

1778
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:34,930
Get him out of here.

1779
02:18:35,150 --> 02:18:35,950
Get the shark too.

1780
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:37,470
Make him extinct.

1781
02:18:40,130 --> 02:18:41,030
Oh, he lives.

1782
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:43,130
That Doki.

1783
02:18:44,990 --> 02:18:46,170
Damn Doki.

1784
02:18:52,750 --> 02:18:53,870
Nice.

1785
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:56,770
That is low Doki, please.

1786
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:05,210
Alright, and now... and now we wait.

1787
02:19:05,210 --> 02:19:05,270
Wait.

1788
02:19:08,830 --> 02:19:10,890
Specifically to Jeff's feces.

1789
02:19:15,270 --> 02:19:17,650
Just to Jeff's feces though.

1790
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:26,390
Did you hear that?

1791
02:19:27,790 --> 02:19:28,830
Oh shit.

1792
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:31,210
There was a... did you hear that?

1793
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:31,990
Like, was it Lee?

1794
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:33,990
That's planning on... or Deadlocked?

1795
02:19:33,990 --> 02:19:35,570
That's planning on adding like...

1796
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:40,530
No, it wasn't Deadlocked.

1797
02:19:40,550 --> 02:19:41,150
What was it?

1798
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:45,410
There was a game that's planning on adding like team chat or slash voice chat.

1799
02:19:45,670 --> 02:19:47,390
I forgot which game it was.

1800
02:19:47,850 --> 02:19:50,350
There was like a big game that's planning on adding it.

1801
02:19:52,890 --> 02:19:53,810
Was it Fortnite?

1802
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:55,710
Oh, was it Fortnite?

1803
02:19:55,990 --> 02:19:56,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1804
02:19:57,170 --> 02:19:58,530
Fortnite's planning on adding chat.

1805
02:19:59,710 --> 02:20:01,150
That's gonna go so well.

1806
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:03,830
With all the children.

1807
02:20:04,530 --> 02:20:07,370
That's gonna... that's gonna go so well.

1808
02:20:10,050 --> 02:20:12,050
No, Lee should never add voice chat.

1809
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:12,670
No.

1810
02:20:19,830 --> 02:20:21,690
I will ult if I hear...

1811
02:20:23,930 --> 02:20:24,430
Oh,

1812
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:29,640
he put... did it to you?

1813
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:36,100
That's right.

1814
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:38,160
Goodbye.

1815
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:38,820
Oh!

1816
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:39,260
Oh!

1817
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:39,780
Oh!

1818
02:20:39,900 --> 02:20:40,280
No!

1819
02:20:40,480 --> 02:20:40,960
Yes!

1820
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:42,100
I'm sorry.

1821
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:44,160
That's fine.

1822
02:20:44,660 --> 02:20:45,800
That's fine.

1823
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:53,760
No, just both our teams, you know?

1824
02:20:56,420 --> 02:20:58,040
It's just both our teams.

1825
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:02,640
I'm just gonna wait here.

1826
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:03,920
I did Mantis ult too.

1827
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:08,780
I passed the quick time event, guys.

1828
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:10,600
I successfully quick timed event.

1829
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:12,500
I got one up there.

1830
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:15,560
That is not a fucking liar.

1831
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,020
He's getting healed by Jeff.

1832
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:19,500
Like, Jeff!

1833
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:24,500
Jeff!

1834
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:30,600
Jeff!

1835
02:21:35,330 --> 02:21:35,800
Bye.

1836
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:38,020
Monkey?

1837
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:41,320
Did he just say monkey one?

1838
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:43,220
Who the fuck is monkey?

1839
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:47,720
Who... who is monkey?

1840
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,520
Who's... who's monkey?

1841
02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:04,360
Venom?

1842
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:07,260
Oh, Bucky.

1843
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:09,820
I thought he said monkey.

1844
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,780
I was like... I was like, which one's the monkey?

1845
02:22:19,890 --> 02:22:21,670
Okay, it was... it was Bucky.

1846
02:22:22,030 --> 02:22:24,510
It felt like he was saying... oh my god.

1847
02:22:25,250 --> 02:22:26,950
Like he was saying of an M.

1848
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:37,270
They're two WPOs.

1849
02:22:37,390 --> 02:22:38,030
They're wide.

1850
02:22:38,250 --> 02:22:43,410
Oh my god.

1851
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:46,170
You fucking jump so fat.

1852
02:22:46,610 --> 02:22:47,550
I'll get one up.

1853
02:22:48,610 --> 02:22:49,870
I can bubble you out of escape.

1854
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:50,730
Oh, nevermind.

1855
02:22:50,810 --> 02:22:51,250
I think you're fine.

1856
02:22:52,470 --> 02:22:54,850
I had to do this so I can get myself healed.

1857
02:22:58,490 --> 02:23:01,430
No, no!

1858
02:23:10,970 --> 02:23:11,170
Yay.

1859
02:23:17,130 --> 02:23:18,010
There you go.

1860
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:23,700
They're frozen.

1861
02:23:25,660 --> 02:23:27,180
She's traumatized.

1862
02:23:27,980 --> 02:23:28,440
I am.

1863
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:30,960
I'm like, who the fuck is monkey?

1864
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:32,900
Bucky!

1865
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:39,020
The PTSD response every time.

1866
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:50,140
I can't.

1867
02:23:52,340 --> 02:23:54,000
I can't.

1868
02:23:54,020 --> 02:23:55,540
I can't.

1869
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:57,700
I want all Jeffs to not have a good day.

1870
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:08,360
But again, I'm scared of typing that in chat because I don't know how... I don't know what the report system is like in the Marvel Rivals.

1871
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:16,560
Apparently, someone that SK reported yesterday, that was in our game yesterday, got banned.

1872
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:21,620
So I'm like, whoa, what did he... I don't remember what he said.

1873
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:22,320
I don't...

1874
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:28,100
So I'm a little worried.

1875
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:38,270
The system works, guys.

1876
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:49,800
Yeah, you get notified if somebody gets banned from a report you do.

1877
02:24:52,320 --> 02:24:53,700
I don't want to get banned.

1878
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:55,240
I mean, I care.

1879
02:24:55,340 --> 02:24:56,100
I don't want to get banned.

1880
02:24:59,300 --> 02:24:59,780
Okay.

1881
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:00,560
But I do care.

1882
02:25:07,090 --> 02:25:08,990
Oh my god, that's fast.

1883
02:25:14,550 --> 02:25:18,030
Okay, now I can hear the Bucky.

1884
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:21,770
I can hear the Bucky now.

1885
02:25:23,510 --> 02:25:25,430
But when he says that, it sounds like monkey!

1886
02:25:25,970 --> 02:25:26,770
I'm not crazy!

1887
02:25:28,710 --> 02:25:29,090
How much?

1888
02:25:30,490 --> 02:25:32,130
Now he's back, now he's back.

1889
02:25:33,610 --> 02:25:34,270
He's in range.

1890
02:25:38,510 --> 02:25:39,650
Oh, he's so low.

1891
02:25:39,710 --> 02:25:39,910
Nice.

1892
02:25:40,310 --> 02:25:41,090
Nice, nice, nice.

1893
02:25:41,330 --> 02:25:42,630
I'm just gonna push it in and fuck it.

1894
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:48,010
I wonder if it's like Overwatch PTSD too when he says that.

1895
02:25:50,510 --> 02:25:52,050
You're like, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey!

1896
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:53,910
Instead of like, Bucky.

1897
02:25:54,550 --> 02:25:56,710
He just went full Overwatch there.

1898
02:25:57,950 --> 02:26:00,310
Oh, my god, he just pushed it like that.

1899
02:26:02,970 --> 02:26:03,490
Yay!

1900
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:07,550
Yeah, he's actually calming.

1901
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:09,390
Is that crazy?

1902
02:26:10,970 --> 02:26:14,810
People communicating in this game as if you... as if like, you know...

1903
02:26:15,730 --> 02:26:18,050
You know, as if it's a team game.

1904
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:23,790
What is that?

1905
02:26:24,390 --> 02:26:25,710
In a team game!

1906
02:26:26,930 --> 02:26:28,790
You have to use... you have to communicate.

1907
02:26:29,390 --> 02:26:32,230
I say as I don't even join the voice chat of the people in my stack.

1908
02:26:36,210 --> 02:26:38,910
Bro, you can't critique me for not...

1909
02:26:39,990 --> 02:26:42,930
Mondin's not even in the team voice, guys.

1910
02:26:43,390 --> 02:26:46,090
He's not even in the team voice, guys.

1911
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:47,510
So like, it's not my fault.

1912
02:26:48,310 --> 02:26:50,770
It's not just my fault, chat.

1913
02:26:52,190 --> 02:26:55,790
By not calming, it's not just my fault.

1914
02:26:56,710 --> 02:26:56,890
LOL

1915
02:27:05,550 --> 02:27:08,430
I do not make it...

1916
02:27:08,430 --> 02:27:08,870
Look!

1917
02:27:09,550 --> 02:27:11,390
SK is calming for us.

1918
02:27:12,510 --> 02:27:14,930
As a stack, we unite as one.

1919
02:27:16,070 --> 02:27:20,150
SK is our... is our like, resident speaker.

1920
02:27:20,930 --> 02:27:23,530
She's our... she's our resident speaker.

1921
02:27:24,690 --> 02:27:26,630
She speaks for all of us.

1922
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:35,880
What the fuck this is, mate?

1923
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:38,560
Oh shit.

1924
02:27:39,740 --> 02:27:40,380
That's fucked.

1925
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:50,220
I had to hold really close because it pushed...

1926
02:27:50,220 --> 02:27:51,440
It didn't push that far.

1927
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:53,620
Thank you,

1928
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:57,340
God.

1929
02:28:04,940 --> 02:28:10,380
Where am I getting shot from?

1930
02:28:10,820 --> 02:28:14,420
Oh no, oh no.

1931
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:18,900
Yay, I get used!

1932
02:28:19,100 --> 02:28:19,860
Makes me happy.

1933
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:22,220
Jesus Christ.

1934
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:25,260
This is... this is why...

1935
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:30,160
This gameplay... this gameplay is exactly why...

1936
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:38,140
This fucking gameplay from the Groot is exactly why my hate is justified.

1937
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:48,500
Makes me want to break some sticks.

1938
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:53,640
Okay, sorry.

1939
02:28:53,780 --> 02:28:54,800
Let me go back to PMA.

1940
02:28:55,660 --> 02:28:57,460
Let me go back to...

1941
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:02,160
Don't worry, I'm a very positive person, guys.

1942
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:06,520
I don't hate people that much.

1943
02:29:06,940 --> 02:29:08,420
Well, not people, you're right.

1944
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:09,480
No, I don't hate people.

1945
02:29:09,960 --> 02:29:11,460
I hate other things.

1946
02:29:13,740 --> 02:29:15,140
Wait, is this a game?

1947
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:17,520
Is this a rank up game?

1948
02:29:17,980 --> 02:29:19,000
Oh my God.

1949
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:21,420
Okay, alright, I'm ready.

1950
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:22,980
I'm ready to be in call.

1951
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:24,980
What if like...

1952
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:26,420
Would it be funny if we lose?

1953
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:27,940
That would be so funny.

1954
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:40,340
Is it auto top 500 when you get to diamond?

1955
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:45,960
Is it?

1956
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:47,420
We'll find out.

1957
02:29:52,410 --> 02:29:53,950
I'm checking the leaderboard.

1958
02:29:53,950 --> 02:29:56,730
I think you have to 1 or 2 after diamond.

1959
02:29:57,090 --> 02:29:59,530
Okay, guys, we're not getting voice yet.

1960
02:30:00,850 --> 02:30:02,030
Is she in here?

1961
02:30:03,210 --> 02:30:05,750
I have to win 1 after diamond.

1962
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:13,460
Let's see who's in there.

1963
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:16,140
Oh, I have the one that gets with the Mantis.

1964
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:17,600
She was a really good support.

1965
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:25,960
Alright, I'm gonna get some napkins real quick to blow my nose.

1966
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:26,960
I'll be right back.

1967
02:30:59,020 --> 02:30:59,780
Mantis shoes.

1968
02:30:59,980 --> 02:31:00,580
Alright, I'm back.

1969
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:03,740
Okay, how is this looking like?

1970
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:04,900
That's right.

1971
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:05,560
That's alright.

1972
02:31:05,980 --> 02:31:06,780
Captain America.

1973
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:10,580
Wait, that's Cap- Wait, what?

1974
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:11,960
Captain America is this guy.

1975
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:14,720
Is he Viking Captain America?

1976
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:16,140
That's not Captain America.

1977
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:23,080
That's not- What Captain America is that?

1978
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:28,820
Captain Gladiator?

1979
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:32,580
Yeah, what's the context of that skin?

1980
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:33,620
Where is he from?

1981
02:31:33,700 --> 02:31:35,100
What country is he from?

1982
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:37,900
There's no gladiators in America.

1983
02:31:48,810 --> 02:31:49,730
What the fuck?

1984
02:31:49,770 --> 02:31:51,030
I jumped here because- Oh!

1985
02:31:52,030 --> 02:31:52,550
Oh!

1986
02:31:54,990 --> 02:31:55,630
Oh!

1987
02:31:57,090 --> 02:31:57,730
Woah!

1988
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,900
I saw Black Panther!

1989
02:32:10,890 --> 02:32:11,830
Captain Norway?

1990
02:32:12,030 --> 02:32:12,750
Is he Captain Norway?

1991
02:32:13,070 --> 02:32:16,030
No, he's a gladiator, so he should be Captain Rome.

1992
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:25,660
Okay, we're focusing.

1993
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:26,280
We're focusing.

1994
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:29,280
We're focusing.

1995
02:32:33,150 --> 02:32:35,150
Okay, that's a lot of damage.

1996
02:32:39,400 --> 02:32:40,660
Oh, I thought that would hit him.

1997
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:42,360
I thought he was going to go to the left side.

1998
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:45,980
Come on, tanks!

1999
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:50,380
We have- Technically, I feel like we have two off tanks, if you think about it.

2000
02:32:54,300 --> 02:32:54,940
Get the tree!

2001
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:56,900
Get the- Oh my god, we could've killed the tree.

2002
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:02,870
Oh, this is bad.

2003
02:33:06,310 --> 02:33:07,210
This is so bad.

2004
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:10,290
Nevermind, we can- We make it work.

2005
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:18,760
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

2006
02:33:25,850 --> 02:33:26,750
What the fuck?

2007
02:33:26,910 --> 02:33:27,470
Where are we?

2008
02:33:28,190 --> 02:33:29,150
What's going on?

2009
02:33:29,530 --> 02:33:31,050
No, no, no!

2010
02:33:31,770 --> 02:33:32,630
Oh, nice, nice.

2011
02:33:32,770 --> 02:33:33,110
No!

2012
02:33:33,470 --> 02:33:34,270
Are you serious?

2013
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:35,070
I was 99!

2014
02:33:38,950 --> 02:33:40,550
Oh my god, we would not have lived.

2015
02:33:41,090 --> 02:33:42,330
None of us would have lived that.

2016
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:49,860
I don't think you can ban heroes yet.

2017
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:52,060
I think it has to be like a full diamond lobby.

2018
02:33:55,880 --> 02:33:58,300
I think you can only do it in a full diamond lobby.

2019
02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:08,420
I'm trying to figure out who would've fucking healed.

2020
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,000
Our two tanks are like super...

2021
02:34:14,580 --> 02:34:15,100
Nice.

2022
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:18,240
Get in!

2023
02:34:19,460 --> 02:34:23,820
Okay, I guess we both get- Alright, let's at least- Oh, he's sleeping.

2024
02:34:24,080 --> 02:34:24,760
He's a little eepy.

2025
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:26,500
It's fine.

2026
02:34:26,660 --> 02:34:27,080
Alright.

2027
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:29,420
It's totally fine.

2028
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:32,680
He's getting fucking kidnapped, but I think he's healthy.

2029
02:34:37,650 --> 02:34:38,430
Get the tree!

2030
02:34:38,510 --> 02:34:38,910
Get the tree!

2031
02:34:40,150 --> 02:34:41,710
That's fucking right!

2032
02:34:45,790 --> 02:34:46,690
That's right!

2033
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:49,110
I'm gonna fucking break your kneecaps.

2034
02:34:49,990 --> 02:34:51,330
No more jumping for you.

2035
02:34:51,490 --> 02:34:53,430
Just like in I, Tanya.

2036
02:35:05,610 --> 02:35:07,290
Oh shit.

2037
02:35:10,750 --> 02:35:13,010
What a reference.

2038
02:35:13,010 --> 02:35:13,530
What a reference.

2039
02:35:21,230 --> 02:35:24,320
That's just such an insane thing to say.

2040
02:35:26,660 --> 02:35:35,700
I've said a lot of things, but you can't- You can't say that was the most insane thing I've said today.

2041
02:35:39,980 --> 02:35:41,540
What kind of this?

2042
02:35:46,260 --> 02:35:47,460
Jesus Christ.

2043
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:48,520
Yeah, none of you guys are living.

2044
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:52,300
You can heal them, but I'm fucking walking away.

2045
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:55,140
That is very confident.

2046
02:36:00,470 --> 02:36:01,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

2047
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:02,290
We closed the door on you.

2048
02:36:02,570 --> 02:36:03,410
So good luck.

2049
02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:11,210
Oh, he didn't live.

2050
02:36:11,950 --> 02:36:12,470
Oh, is that SK?

2051
02:36:12,590 --> 02:36:13,830
Oh, she didn't live.

2052
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:23,920
Unfortunate SK.

2053
02:36:25,580 --> 02:36:27,660
When the door closed, it was over.

2054
02:36:30,300 --> 02:36:33,580
The door- Oh, we closed the door again.

2055
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:36,840
As soon as that door closed, it was over for her.

2056
02:36:38,900 --> 02:36:39,580
I knew.

2057
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:45,540
I heard a portal.

2058
02:36:46,300 --> 02:36:47,460
You got a portal?

2059
02:36:48,220 --> 02:36:49,440
The fuck does that mean?

2060
02:37:00,030 --> 02:37:01,490
Oh, that's right!

2061
02:37:02,690 --> 02:37:04,610
Oh, that's not right.

2062
02:37:04,990 --> 02:37:06,090
Oh, that's okay.

2063
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:07,890
I can dance on the other side.

2064
02:37:08,730 --> 02:37:12,270
Let me walk the other way.

2065
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:15,190
You're gonna make a wall?

2066
02:37:15,730 --> 02:37:17,090
Oh, that's fucking right!

2067
02:37:17,330 --> 02:37:19,470
Oh, I wish I could crouch spam.

2068
02:37:20,110 --> 02:37:21,970
This is the only thing I wish this game had.

2069
02:37:22,090 --> 02:37:22,850
Crouch spamming.

2070
02:37:24,310 --> 02:37:25,210
Get iced again.

2071
02:37:25,890 --> 02:37:26,690
Ice, ice, baby.

2072
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:40,990
Everything's fine.

2073
02:37:44,030 --> 02:37:46,030
Alright, I'm fucking- I'm sorry.

2074
02:37:46,310 --> 02:37:47,790
You're just gonna have to die.

2075
02:37:49,530 --> 02:37:50,010
What?

2076
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:50,830
Oh, shit!

2077
02:37:51,950 --> 02:37:52,910
Oh, shit!

2078
02:37:54,850 --> 02:37:57,430
We got, like, trem- We got Wakanda'd!

2079
02:38:00,550 --> 02:38:02,110
Heroes don't kneel.

2080
02:38:09,140 --> 02:38:11,280
I think we're not the heroes right now.

2081
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:13,520
Are we doing a bad thing, sending this over?

2082
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:18,140
Like, doesn't this mean we're destroying the planet when we're sending this over?

2083
02:38:26,550 --> 02:38:28,850
Yeah, guys, I don't think we're heroes anymore.

2084
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:32,270
Oh, no, he doesn't see me, though.

2085
02:38:32,370 --> 02:38:33,330
He doesn't see me.

2086
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:36,790
Oh, but he sees me!

2087
02:38:40,210 --> 02:38:42,090
He was actually so low, too.

2088
02:38:42,250 --> 02:38:42,750
I'm sad.

2089
02:38:46,450 --> 02:38:48,330
Oh my god, he was so low.

2090
02:38:52,980 --> 02:38:54,520
No, I have to reload my hands!

2091
02:39:00,610 --> 02:39:01,610
Guys, I can't!

2092
02:39:02,970 --> 02:39:05,590
My mousepad, I can't!

2093
02:39:09,210 --> 02:39:11,450
That's fine, let's all just dance together.

2094
02:39:13,770 --> 02:39:18,710
Oh my god!

2095
02:39:28,170 --> 02:39:28,570
Are we?

2096
02:39:28,870 --> 02:39:29,370
Are we?

2097
02:39:29,610 --> 02:39:35,140
We're- Oh, no.

2098
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:38,060
Oh, we pushed pretty far!

2099
02:39:40,740 --> 02:39:42,300
We pushed pretty far!

2100
02:39:47,050 --> 02:39:47,470
That's fine.

2101
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:49,390
That's fine!

2102
02:39:49,770 --> 02:39:50,710
We pushed so far!

2103
02:39:51,130 --> 02:39:52,050
There's hope!

2104
02:39:54,870 --> 02:39:56,790
I am- Okay, I'm so locked in.

2105
02:39:57,370 --> 02:39:59,010
I'm so fucking locked in.

2106
02:39:59,290 --> 02:40:00,470
How dare you say that?

2107
02:40:00,830 --> 02:40:02,690
I am the most locked in person here.

2108
02:40:03,890 --> 02:40:04,910
That's not true.

2109
02:40:05,250 --> 02:40:08,190
I think SK's just a lot locked in, and me, not gonna lie.

2110
02:40:08,430 --> 02:40:11,530
But, like, I'm so fucking locked in, guys.

2111
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:13,710
This is it.

2112
02:40:16,190 --> 02:40:17,290
This is it.

2113
02:40:20,250 --> 02:40:22,710
We can win this, I believe.

2114
02:40:26,660 --> 02:40:28,340
I'm currently plat 1.

2115
02:40:28,660 --> 02:40:30,640
If we win this, we're diamond 3.

2116
02:40:30,980 --> 02:40:33,000
And then we have to win an extra game.

2117
02:40:40,780 --> 02:40:43,200
It's not an instant top 500.

2118
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:55,820
Oh my god, but we're actually climbing.

2119
02:40:57,920 --> 02:41:00,720
I thought these only happen in my dreams.

2120
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:04,060
I thought these only happen when I'm dreaming.

2121
02:41:04,300 --> 02:41:05,100
Wait, how do I get up there?

2122
02:41:05,180 --> 02:41:05,660
Oh, shit.

2123
02:41:07,460 --> 02:41:07,620
Woo!

2124
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:09,100
We're gonna play up here?

2125
02:41:10,060 --> 02:41:11,020
That's interesting.

2126
02:41:12,140 --> 02:41:13,340
Oh, they just opened this door.

2127
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:20,840
Where?

2128
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:22,400
Are they gonna portal?

2129
02:41:24,320 --> 02:41:26,340
I fucking knew it.

2130
02:41:33,480 --> 02:41:34,560
Oh my god.

2131
02:41:41,530 --> 02:41:43,910
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

2132
02:41:45,430 --> 02:41:45,990
Woah!

2133
02:41:54,460 --> 02:41:55,020
Okay.

2134
02:41:56,200 --> 02:41:58,100
Okay, I did not expect to see him there.

2135
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:06,580
Alright, that was unexpected.

2136
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:08,080
The flank there.

2137
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:13,140
I know, that's- I know.

2138
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:14,960
It's cause he does like- he does like this.

2139
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:17,980
That's- oh, I didn't.

2140
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:21,760
I thought I, like, did like a whole goodbye.

2141
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:23,540
Goodbye there.

2142
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:30,260
I knew he was- What, already?

2143
02:42:30,260 --> 02:42:30,500
Already?

2144
02:42:34,380 --> 02:42:34,860
What?!

2145
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:37,060
No, I was 10%!

2146
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:43,980
Okay, that wasn't my fault.

2147
02:42:44,440 --> 02:42:46,260
That was definitely not my fault.

2148
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:49,180
Bro, he- Oh, shit, bro, they're treating us off.

2149
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:49,740
What do we do?

2150
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:51,340
We're building walls.

2151
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:56,180
Where's- where's a hero that can fucking make fires?

2152
02:42:56,180 --> 02:42:56,720
Where's-

2153
02:43:10,460 --> 02:43:11,600
Oh, we're using this.

2154
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:12,760
Oh, we- okay, nice.

2155
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:18,180
Oh, we used two support ults!

2156
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:18,740
No!

2157
02:43:19,380 --> 02:43:21,460
The mantis also used it!

2158
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:23,780
That's unlucky.

2159
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:27,020
The mantis also used her support ult and I didn't know.

2160
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:31,440
That's fine, we still have three ults.

2161
02:43:31,480 --> 02:43:32,100
We have three ults.

2162
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:34,020
Okay, that's not fine, though.

2163
02:43:34,180 --> 02:43:40,240
We lost- Here we go.

2164
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:41,320
Let's run back.

2165
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:44,720
Oh, if only we had one of those.

2166
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:49,720
Okay, maybe?

2167
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:50,420
Oh, nice!

2168
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:51,260
Nice.

2169
02:43:51,860 --> 02:43:53,880
Okay, not nice, we just got one pick off that.

2170
02:43:59,200 --> 02:43:59,680
What?

2171
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:03,700
We only got one- we got one kill off of that.

2172
02:44:03,900 --> 02:44:04,500
That's unlucky.

2173
02:44:05,160 --> 02:44:06,520
It's okay, we can full hold this.

2174
02:44:11,090 --> 02:44:12,630
We can full hold this.

2175
02:44:14,970 --> 02:44:15,790
That's fine.

2176
02:44:16,530 --> 02:44:17,790
Five minute full hold?

2177
02:44:18,030 --> 02:44:18,850
Probably could've been worse.

2178
02:44:23,580 --> 02:44:25,020
Like, it can't be that bad.

2179
02:44:25,020 --> 02:44:25,480
Again?

2180
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:29,800
Okay, we gotta heal each other.

2181
02:44:30,260 --> 02:44:31,140
We gotta heal each other.

2182
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:35,440
As long as we got each other, we should be fine.

2183
02:44:38,480 --> 02:44:38,980
Okay!

2184
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:48,960
To be fair, the mantis' eye- oh my god, one of our tanks has like 14 deaths.

2185
02:44:49,060 --> 02:44:49,700
That's crazy.

2186
02:44:58,190 --> 02:44:59,130
That's crazy.

2187
02:44:59,370 --> 02:45:01,190
How do you have 14 deaths?

2188
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:06,140
You're so buff!

2189
02:45:11,010 --> 02:45:12,430
I'm just gonna put on the other tank.

2190
02:45:12,590 --> 02:45:16,730
I can't- Our tank is like, not having it.

2191
02:45:23,580 --> 02:45:24,540
I can!

2192
02:45:24,960 --> 02:45:25,660
Press Q!

2193
02:45:28,210 --> 02:45:30,710
Press Q and it wouldn't let me!

2194
02:45:38,750 --> 02:45:40,590
I got pinged so hard.

2195
02:45:41,650 --> 02:45:42,650
Oh, no!

2196
02:45:42,650 --> 02:45:43,030
No!

2197
02:45:47,490 --> 02:45:50,810
I got pinged so hard!

2198
02:45:52,570 --> 02:45:55,530
Guys, it's so funny that I lost this game.

2199
02:45:55,870 --> 02:45:58,810
It's so- it's so fucking funny!

2200
02:46:05,210 --> 02:46:07,230
Oh my god.

2201
02:46:07,790 --> 02:46:08,350
No!

2202
02:46:14,090 --> 02:46:15,090
No!

2203
02:46:18,980 --> 02:46:19,880
It's okay.

2204
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:21,280
It's okay.

2205
02:46:21,580 --> 02:46:23,580
It's about building character.

2206
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:28,900
Yeah, but the thing is, they're not talking about me.

2207
02:46:28,980 --> 02:46:30,260
They don't know who the fuck I am.

2208
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:32,380
That's the best part.

2209
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:36,740
They're only talking about- Wait, is this the same team?

2210
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:39,020
No, we have different people.

2211
02:46:39,440 --> 02:46:41,120
We're fighting the same team.

2212
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:46,380
We're fighting- we're literally fighting the fucking same team.

2213
02:46:48,060 --> 02:46:51,020
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

2214
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:52,000
That's crazy.

2215
02:47:02,610 --> 02:47:06,430
That's crazy that we're- we're fighting the same team.

2216
02:47:09,610 --> 02:47:11,050
We only need one.

2217
02:47:12,810 --> 02:47:15,030
We don't have any tank players?

2218
02:47:18,570 --> 02:47:22,270
Oh my god, we have zero tank players.

2219
02:47:22,750 --> 02:47:23,450
Bro!

2220
02:47:24,070 --> 02:47:24,930
We got this shit.

2221
02:47:26,510 --> 02:47:27,830
I believe in us.

2222
02:47:29,690 --> 02:47:30,750
I believe in us.

2223
02:47:30,830 --> 02:47:33,190
There's no- we don't need a tank.

2224
02:47:35,910 --> 02:47:36,730
This is- it's alright.

2225
02:47:37,190 --> 02:47:38,430
Guys, we just need three wins.

2226
02:47:38,950 --> 02:47:42,630
We just- guys, we just need three wins, guys.

2227
02:47:47,050 --> 02:47:48,730
Guys, we don't need two anymore.

2228
02:47:48,890 --> 02:47:49,970
We just need three wins.

2229
02:47:49,970 --> 02:47:50,330
What was that?

2230
02:47:54,070 --> 02:47:54,970
That's fine.

2231
02:47:59,630 --> 02:48:00,190
Exactly.

2232
02:48:00,510 --> 02:48:02,610
If we just kill everything, we don't need tanks.

2233
02:48:03,330 --> 02:48:03,850
You're right.

2234
02:48:04,250 --> 02:48:05,450
Oh my god, you're so right.

2235
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:13,460
We actually have zero- that's crazy that we have no

2236
02:48:18,760 --> 02:48:26,970
- Good luck.

2237
02:48:28,990 --> 02:48:30,430
Oh hey, okay.

2238
02:48:35,130 --> 02:48:40,470
I thought- I thought we all had a plan where we killed a tank.

2239
02:48:41,310 --> 02:48:45,050
There's only one- we killed everybody but the fucking tank.

2240
02:48:45,490 --> 02:48:46,830
How is that possible?

2241
02:48:47,290 --> 02:48:55,150
We didn't even kill the tank that mattered.

2242
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:03,840
Good luck.

2243
02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:10,220
I'm like not doing okay.

2244
02:49:11,400 --> 02:49:14,400
Like mentally and like my- oh hey, nice.

2245
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:15,900
We got a tank!

2246
02:49:19,590 --> 02:49:21,510
Oh my god, we got a tank, guys.

2247
02:49:26,460 --> 02:49:27,380
I knew it.

2248
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:29,400
I knew that we had actual tank players.

2249
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:35,660
Oh my god.

2250
02:49:37,060 --> 02:49:39,140
We actually had tank players.

2251
02:49:40,900 --> 02:49:42,760
This guy was like, you know what?

2252
02:49:42,820 --> 02:49:44,320
I actually sort of want to win now.

2253
02:49:49,820 --> 02:49:51,480
Wait, what's breakable?

2254
02:49:52,060 --> 02:49:53,520
Okay, I can stay up here.

2255
02:50:04,490 --> 02:50:06,030
Oh god, my hands.

2256
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:19,760
Okay.

2257
02:50:20,980 --> 02:50:21,820
Yay!

2258
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:26,440
We're undefeatable!

2259
02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:31,480
Yay!

2260
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:35,880
That's fucking right.

2261
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:40,660
That's fucking right, just start dancing.

2262
02:50:41,580 --> 02:50:43,420
Whoa, nice, I'm back up here.

2263
02:50:49,390 --> 02:50:50,230
Oh.

2264
02:50:51,350 --> 02:50:52,250
I'm fine.

2265
02:50:52,570 --> 02:50:52,830
Whoa.

2266
02:50:55,090 --> 02:50:57,030
Mantis, don't make her do this to me.

2267
02:50:57,170 --> 02:50:59,590
Mantis, why didn't you let her do this to me?

2268
02:51:00,210 --> 02:51:06,430
Why didn't you let her do that?

2269
02:51:08,970 --> 02:51:11,430
Why didn't you just watch?

2270
02:51:11,430 --> 02:51:11,450
Mantis.

2271
02:51:16,430 --> 02:51:17,290
What?

2272
02:51:26,070 --> 02:51:27,470
And

2273
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:33,340
he's also asleep.

2274
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:35,340
What?

2275
02:51:37,700 --> 02:51:38,120
What?

2276
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:41,300
Okay.

2277
02:51:42,520 --> 02:51:44,300
I went in and like...

2278
02:51:47,280 --> 02:51:48,500
They were ready.

2279
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:55,920
I don't even think we could go touch.

2280
02:52:02,750 --> 02:52:04,110
Fuck you in particular.

2281
02:52:11,230 --> 02:52:13,430
Yeah, definitely should not have went, yeah.

2282
02:52:13,890 --> 02:52:15,370
Never should have went in the portal.

2283
02:52:16,910 --> 02:52:17,430
That...

2284
02:52:17,430 --> 02:52:19,750
Going through that portal was a mistake.

2285
02:52:19,890 --> 02:52:20,750
That's for sure.

2286
02:52:22,290 --> 02:52:22,890
Definitely...

2287
02:52:22,890 --> 02:52:24,270
Where I was gonna die.

2288
02:52:39,160 --> 02:52:41,020
I didn't know who to...

2289
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:43,980
Who's MVP?

2290
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:46,400
Alright, you get this.

2291
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:51,060
If you do really well, you get a little treat, little girl.

2292
02:52:52,020 --> 02:52:53,860
You get the little... Oh my god!

2293
02:52:58,180 --> 02:52:58,820
Okay.

2294
02:52:59,420 --> 02:53:00,960
I didn't mean it like that.

2295
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:03,320
I didn't...

2296
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:07,660
I didn't mean it like that.

2297
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:08,460
Okay.

2298
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:11,720
I was just gonna give you a piece of candy.

2299
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:13,400
Okay.

2300
02:53:16,660 --> 02:53:18,280
Now I'm uncomfortable.

2301
02:53:18,940 --> 02:53:20,720
Now I need to report to HR.

2302
02:53:30,900 --> 02:53:33,280
Sleep, sleep.

2303
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:37,000
Doki got ERP.

2304
02:53:54,870 --> 02:53:57,310
The timing for that was crazy though.

2305
02:53:57,390 --> 02:53:58,170
Oh my god!

2306
02:53:58,910 --> 02:54:00,210
Look at me, look at me!

2307
02:54:00,390 --> 02:54:01,450
Mantis, look at me!

2308
02:54:01,790 --> 02:54:02,450
Look at me!

2309
02:54:07,110 --> 02:54:10,530
As long as you look at me, everything will be okay.

2310
02:54:22,700 --> 02:54:23,860
Mantis, nice.

2311
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:25,020
Fine.

2312
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:28,340
Okay, we're fine.

2313
02:54:33,580 --> 02:54:36,180
No, no, no, no!

2314
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:39,820
Good luck, everybody!

2315
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:41,120
Oh my god!

2316
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:43,800
I didn't know where these come from!

2317
02:54:44,480 --> 02:54:45,680
I didn't...

2318
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:49,040
Where did Wakanda come from?

2319
02:54:53,240 --> 02:54:56,420
I don't even know where Wakanda came from.

2320
02:55:09,510 --> 02:55:11,170
Save them.

2321
02:55:12,670 --> 02:55:13,770
I'm a hero.

2322
02:55:17,290 --> 02:55:19,510
I'm a fucking hero.

2323
02:55:26,950 --> 02:55:28,350
Okay.

2324
02:55:29,790 --> 02:55:30,890
Okay.

2325
02:55:34,210 --> 02:55:35,610
Yeah.

2326
02:55:38,690 --> 02:55:39,510
You're alive.

2327
02:55:40,410 --> 02:55:41,490
That's all that matters.

2328
02:55:42,250 --> 02:55:43,430
You're so healthy.

2329
02:55:46,510 --> 02:55:47,770
You're incredibly...

2330
02:55:47,770 --> 02:55:49,070
You're very healthy.

2331
02:55:52,210 --> 02:55:54,130
You're still so healthy.

2332
02:55:54,730 --> 02:55:56,010
I'm not though.

2333
02:55:56,750 --> 02:55:58,370
I'm not healthy, I'm not okay.

2334
02:56:02,970 --> 02:56:05,650
Please, just dance with me!

2335
02:56:08,610 --> 02:56:09,450
Nice.

2336
02:56:11,810 --> 02:56:13,730
And then I leave.

2337
02:56:14,270 --> 02:56:15,710
So I hope you live.

2338
02:56:21,570 --> 02:56:22,310
Please.

2339
02:56:23,150 --> 02:56:23,830
Mantis, nice.

2340
02:56:25,390 --> 02:56:25,770
Alright.

2341
02:56:29,230 --> 02:56:31,170
We're a little fucked, guys.

2342
02:56:31,810 --> 02:56:33,610
We have zero support ult.

2343
02:56:34,930 --> 02:56:35,730
And...

2344
02:56:35,730 --> 02:56:38,670
We have storm ult, guys.

2345
02:56:38,950 --> 02:56:40,050
So like...

2346
02:56:40,050 --> 02:56:41,030
I think so.

2347
02:56:42,110 --> 02:56:42,950
Mmm...

2348
02:56:43,830 --> 02:56:45,130
Something's not right.

2349
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:53,840
I'm a little concerned.

2350
02:56:58,840 --> 02:57:01,340
I don't think we've been very successful countering storm.

2351
02:57:05,860 --> 02:57:06,280
No.

2352
02:57:06,740 --> 02:57:06,980
No.

2353
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:07,780
No.

2354
02:57:08,220 --> 02:57:08,640
No.

2355
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:09,400
No.

2356
02:57:16,990 --> 02:57:20,450
What do I do in that situation?

2357
02:57:20,990 --> 02:57:22,430
What do I do?

2358
02:57:23,350 --> 02:57:24,570
What do I do?

2359
02:57:24,750 --> 02:57:30,070
I'm the only one...

2360
02:57:32,260 --> 02:57:33,200
Oh my god.

2361
02:57:34,160 --> 02:57:42,410
I just died.

2362
02:57:43,050 --> 02:57:43,520
I just...

2363
02:57:45,930 --> 02:57:47,350
Oh my god.

2364
02:57:48,010 --> 02:57:49,650
I just...

2365
02:57:50,170 --> 02:57:51,430
I just died.

2366
02:57:55,920 --> 02:57:57,520
I know I'll die...

2367
02:57:57,520 --> 02:57:58,700
I'd run.

2368
02:57:59,060 --> 02:57:59,900
But like...

2369
02:58:00,500 --> 02:58:01,500
Where do I go?

2370
02:58:02,080 --> 02:58:03,640
Where do I go?

2371
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:08,080
It's okay, guys.

2372
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:09,580
Three games.

2373
02:58:12,680 --> 02:58:14,000
Three games, guys.

2374
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:15,200
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2375
02:58:15,340 --> 02:58:15,960
I'll be right back.

2376
02:59:15,300 --> 02:59:15,580
Okay.

2377
02:59:16,380 --> 02:59:17,340
Three games.

2378
02:59:18,380 --> 02:59:19,340
Three games.

2379
02:59:19,580 --> 02:59:20,480
Oh, thank god that...

2380
02:59:20,480 --> 02:59:22,700
I'm gonna make sure I avoid the Luna Snow only person.

2381
02:59:24,460 --> 02:59:26,100
I'm gonna make sure...

2382
02:59:26,100 --> 02:59:28,500
That Luna Snow only person, I'm avoiding her so...

2383
02:59:28,500 --> 02:59:28,720
Oh, wait.

2384
02:59:28,760 --> 02:59:29,280
Actually, no.

2385
02:59:29,340 --> 02:59:29,920
That's fine.

2386
02:59:30,580 --> 02:59:31,020
I...

2387
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:33,720
I can play other characters now.

2388
02:59:33,880 --> 02:59:35,780
Guys, I'm not a one trick anymore.

2389
02:59:36,020 --> 02:59:36,380
Chat.

2390
02:59:36,920 --> 02:59:38,240
Just so you guys know.

2391
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:41,080
Also, Lucas, thank you for 50 gifted shits.

2392
02:59:41,160 --> 02:59:41,440
Thank you.

2393
02:59:41,500 --> 02:59:42,100
Thank you.

2394
02:59:42,620 --> 02:59:44,000
I really appreciate it.

2395
02:59:44,040 --> 02:59:45,000
Thank you so much.

2396
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:47,060
Guys, I'm not one trick anymore.

2397
02:59:47,320 --> 02:59:48,080
I can play other...

2398
02:59:48,080 --> 02:59:49,100
I can play Cloak...

2399
02:59:49,100 --> 02:59:50,320
and Dagger.

2400
02:59:51,820 --> 02:59:52,420
Oh, shit.

2401
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:53,200
We're running three supports?

2402
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:00,760
Three games.

2403
03:00:01,320 --> 03:00:02,760
Three games.

2404
03:00:04,840 --> 03:00:06,880
Three fucking games, guys.

2405
03:00:07,980 --> 03:00:10,880
This is Marvel Rivals codes.

2406
03:00:11,800 --> 03:00:16,320
I used to be only able to play Dagger.

2407
03:00:16,660 --> 03:00:17,580
But now...

2408
03:00:17,580 --> 03:00:19,700
I can do Cloak and Dagger.

2409
03:00:21,160 --> 03:00:22,120
That's right.

2410
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:24,200
That's fucking right.

2411
03:00:24,620 --> 03:00:26,280
I finally learned.

2412
03:00:28,300 --> 03:00:29,260
And like...

2413
03:00:29,260 --> 03:00:31,460
Is my Cloak and Dagger the same level as my Luna Snow?

2414
03:00:32,220 --> 03:00:33,460
That's a good question.

2415
03:00:35,440 --> 03:00:36,600
I can play them.

2416
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:43,420
I know what their moves do.

2417
03:00:55,910 --> 03:00:57,670
I wish there was a way...

2418
03:00:57,670 --> 03:00:58,730
I guess like if I...

2419
03:00:58,730 --> 03:01:00,650
I guess it's defensive ult is to counter.

2420
03:01:00,650 --> 03:01:04,810
Just a lot of these ults do so much.

2421
03:01:12,450 --> 03:01:12,930
Nice.

2422
03:01:13,270 --> 03:01:15,410
No one can die now.

2423
03:01:25,400 --> 03:01:26,180
Oh my god.

2424
03:01:26,240 --> 03:01:26,880
I thought I hit him.

2425
03:01:28,560 --> 03:01:29,760
I'm gonna heal the right side.

2426
03:01:30,660 --> 03:01:31,920
I think they got the left side.

2427
03:01:34,980 --> 03:01:36,220
Oh, they definitely got the...

2428
03:01:36,220 --> 03:01:38,760
The only issue right now is that...

2429
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:41,920
It's gonna be harder to get support ults because there's three of us.

2430
03:01:44,480 --> 03:01:45,160
Oh shit.

2431
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:47,760
Fuck.

2432
03:01:53,780 --> 03:01:54,640
It's fine.

2433
03:01:55,480 --> 03:01:57,620
We're all so alive and healthy.

2434
03:01:59,440 --> 03:02:03,240
I am at 60% from my first support ult.

2435
03:02:03,760 --> 03:02:04,680
That's fine.

2436
03:02:10,660 --> 03:02:11,660
It's fine.

2437
03:02:13,480 --> 03:02:15,400
Oh my god, this is like ghost.

2438
03:02:15,900 --> 03:02:16,780
Oh no.

2439
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:18,940
I hope we get roll Q.

2440
03:02:22,340 --> 03:02:25,240
This feels just like ghost.

2441
03:02:26,840 --> 03:02:28,100
Who is he trying to kill?

2442
03:02:28,240 --> 03:02:29,100
Oh my god.

2443
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:33,040
Oh.

2444
03:02:34,020 --> 03:02:34,740
That's a little awkward.

2445
03:02:35,020 --> 03:02:35,460
That's fine.

2446
03:02:36,820 --> 03:02:37,520
That's fine.

2447
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:40,360
We got two support ults for one support ult.

2448
03:02:40,420 --> 03:02:41,500
What a great trade.

2449
03:02:44,820 --> 03:02:45,780
Worth it.

2450
03:02:59,880 --> 03:03:01,420
Roll Q did not kill overwatch.

2451
03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:04,100
Roll Q improved overwatch in my opinion.

2452
03:03:08,330 --> 03:03:08,830
No.

2453
03:03:09,090 --> 03:03:11,310
Roll Q was not what killed overwatch.

2454
03:03:12,910 --> 03:03:17,070
Other things killed overwatch, but it was definitely not roll Q.

2455
03:03:27,570 --> 03:03:28,690
I don't know.

2456
03:03:28,770 --> 03:03:29,850
Do I put on another support?

2457
03:03:29,950 --> 03:03:30,850
I'll put on another support.

2458
03:03:30,850 --> 03:03:33,150
So I don't have to worry about healing the other support.

2459
03:03:34,030 --> 03:03:39,250
I'm like thinking like, obviously everybody is going to be keeping the DPS alive.

2460
03:03:39,350 --> 03:03:42,150
So then I'm like, who will keep the other support alive?

2461
03:03:42,410 --> 03:03:42,730
You know?

2462
03:03:45,650 --> 03:03:46,130
Bye.

2463
03:03:48,110 --> 03:03:48,590
Oh.

2464
03:03:48,730 --> 03:03:49,350
Oh my god.

2465
03:03:49,590 --> 03:03:50,050
Hello!

2466
03:03:52,850 --> 03:03:53,330
Hello!

2467
03:03:56,110 --> 03:03:57,050
No goodbye!

2468
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:03,620
Wait, I hit somebody.

2469
03:04:04,440 --> 03:04:04,880
Wait.

2470
03:04:11,890 --> 03:04:13,030
Oh, I'm trying to keep going.

2471
03:04:13,210 --> 03:04:14,110
Oh my god!

2472
03:04:14,190 --> 03:04:15,050
Again, I'm sorry!

2473
03:04:26,180 --> 03:04:27,260
Oh my god, nice.

2474
03:04:29,900 --> 03:04:30,680
I'm scared.

2475
03:04:35,890 --> 03:04:36,330
No!

2476
03:04:36,830 --> 03:04:37,590
I needed heal!

2477
03:04:43,090 --> 03:04:45,170
If I got heals, I would have gotten my ult.

2478
03:04:47,920 --> 03:04:48,760
What the fuck?

2479
03:04:48,900 --> 03:04:49,860
Is she okay?

2480
03:04:50,180 --> 03:04:51,300
Is she okay?

2481
03:04:56,300 --> 03:04:57,460
It's okay, I'm coming over.

2482
03:04:59,440 --> 03:05:00,840
Do not be afraid!

2483
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:03,500
Okay.

2484
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:06,200
Okay.

2485
03:05:08,040 --> 03:05:09,040
Okay.

2486
03:05:09,660 --> 03:05:12,100
I guess I have to use this.

2487
03:05:13,180 --> 03:05:14,940
Do be afraid.

2488
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:19,640
Oh my god, do be afraid.

2489
03:05:20,460 --> 03:05:21,860
Oh yes, C9!

2490
03:05:24,920 --> 03:05:25,920
C9!

2491
03:05:30,280 --> 03:05:30,720
Roll Q?

2492
03:05:32,420 --> 03:05:34,000
Saved competitive Overwatch?

2493
03:05:34,380 --> 03:05:35,940
Just there shouldn't have been roll Q and quick play.

2494
03:05:36,260 --> 03:05:37,780
Roll Q should have been choice and quick play.

2495
03:05:37,900 --> 03:05:42,220
There should have been like, quick play with roll Q and then like, um...

2496
03:05:42,220 --> 03:05:47,340
Cause I know they added no limits, but they should have made roll Q for quick play the arcade mode.

2497
03:05:48,720 --> 03:05:49,600
Versus, uh...

2498
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:50,980
Versus the other way around.

2499
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,840
That was the best round I've had in five games?

2500
03:05:55,200 --> 03:05:56,680
That was GOATS!

2501
03:05:56,680 --> 03:05:59,100
You do not say that about GOATS!

2502
03:05:59,100 --> 03:06:03,020
That is like nobody dying for like a hundred years.

2503
03:06:09,340 --> 03:06:12,420
I wouldn't say that was the best round.

2504
03:06:18,400 --> 03:06:21,140
GOATS was fun until it wasn't.

2505
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:25,180
I don't want my games to last 20 years, guys.

2506
03:06:34,260 --> 03:06:35,140
Wait, where are we at?

2507
03:06:35,220 --> 03:06:36,680
Are we at three games or two games?

2508
03:06:37,740 --> 03:06:38,780
I've lost track.

2509
03:06:39,560 --> 03:06:41,300
We've been at this for way too long.

2510
03:06:48,400 --> 03:06:49,820
I feel like...

2511
03:06:49,820 --> 03:06:51,720
I feel like it's been 20 years.

2512
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:54,300
Okay, three games.

2513
03:06:54,640 --> 03:06:56,680
Oh yeah, cause we lost the all DPS round.

2514
03:07:00,480 --> 03:07:01,200
I missed.

2515
03:07:01,960 --> 03:07:02,740
My ice missed.

2516
03:07:08,540 --> 03:07:09,900
What is GOATS?

2517
03:07:10,400 --> 03:07:13,400
It was basically a type of...

2518
03:07:13,400 --> 03:07:17,940
It was basically three supports, three tanks, and nothing died.

2519
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:19,580
That was GOATS.

2520
03:07:20,140 --> 03:07:23,440
And then the thing is, nothing was stronger than GOATS.

2521
03:07:23,740 --> 03:07:27,720
Because nothing was stronger than GOATS, everybody played GOATS.

2522
03:07:28,180 --> 03:07:29,840
Because if you play any other...

2523
03:07:29,840 --> 03:07:33,320
If you try to play a DPS character, you're just fucking throwing.

2524
03:07:34,760 --> 03:07:35,440
Like...

2525
03:07:36,520 --> 03:07:37,800
And basically...

2526
03:07:38,420 --> 03:07:42,720
That was what the game was for like months.

2527
03:07:43,800 --> 03:07:45,600
Quick and competitive.

2528
03:07:46,180 --> 03:07:49,760
Because it was literally the only thing that would let you win.

2529
03:07:50,540 --> 03:07:53,840
The only thing better than GOATS is a team that's better at GOATS.

2530
03:07:54,860 --> 03:08:02,280
And the reason why it's called GOATS is because the team that invented it was called GOATS.

2531
03:08:03,140 --> 03:08:04,580
Their team name...

2532
03:08:04,580 --> 03:08:06,700
Their team name was literally GOATS.

2533
03:08:07,020 --> 03:08:08,700
And they were the fuckers.

2534
03:08:09,220 --> 03:08:14,680
The brilliant fuckers that invented the most fucked up comp possible.

2535
03:08:20,070 --> 03:08:22,670
That's why it was called GOATS.

2536
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:29,380
Oh, nice.

2537
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:30,160
Got her.

2538
03:08:36,050 --> 03:08:36,870
Okay, guys.

2539
03:08:42,140 --> 03:08:43,240
It's fine.

2540
03:08:43,240 --> 03:08:44,420
I got you.

2541
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:49,760
You know what?

2542
03:08:49,820 --> 03:08:52,280
Let's let the two supports fucking tank this.

2543
03:08:57,310 --> 03:09:00,510
Alright, now it's my turn.

2544
03:09:04,470 --> 03:09:06,130
I expected us to kill something.

2545
03:09:06,550 --> 03:09:07,890
Guys, nothing has died.

2546
03:09:09,670 --> 03:09:10,210
Guys...

2547
03:09:10,210 --> 03:09:12,050
Nothing has died.

2548
03:09:18,570 --> 03:09:20,450
Nothing has died, guys.

2549
03:09:27,060 --> 03:09:29,480
Guys, nothing has died.

2550
03:09:30,220 --> 03:09:32,240
Welcome to GOATS.

2551
03:09:33,280 --> 03:09:36,500
I swear, nothing has died during that entire fight.

2552
03:09:42,800 --> 03:09:45,780
Oh my god, nothing died until we died.

2553
03:09:46,480 --> 03:09:48,840
Oh, guys, they went GOATS.

2554
03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:49,820
Guys, I can't.

2555
03:09:49,860 --> 03:09:50,840
That makes sense.

2556
03:09:50,840 --> 03:09:52,840
Oh my god, they went GOATS.

2557
03:09:53,680 --> 03:09:55,840
Oh my god, they fucking went GOATS.

2558
03:09:56,820 --> 03:09:59,500
They fucking went GOATS, guys.

2559
03:09:59,740 --> 03:10:02,140
They actually went GOATS.

2560
03:10:02,740 --> 03:10:04,900
Oh my god, I mean, they went GOATS.

2561
03:10:06,040 --> 03:10:07,200
Oh my god.

2562
03:10:07,820 --> 03:10:11,640
Oh no, that makes so much more sense now.

2563
03:10:12,080 --> 03:10:12,840
That makes...

2564
03:10:13,420 --> 03:10:15,660
That makes a lot of sense.

2565
03:10:16,180 --> 03:10:19,620
I was like, wondering why nothing is dying even more.

2566
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:25,260
I love GOATS.

2567
03:10:25,740 --> 03:10:28,780
This is the fucking new meta.

2568
03:10:30,060 --> 03:10:38,060
Guys, this is also why I wanted to hurry up and get top 500 before shit like this is brought back.

2569
03:10:40,960 --> 03:10:42,240
I couldn't...

2570
03:10:42,240 --> 03:10:46,480
I couldn't deal with bringing this... with having to play with this.

2571
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:53,400
That's why.

2572
03:10:57,220 --> 03:10:58,660
Alright, let's go.

2573
03:11:00,180 --> 03:11:01,620
Let's fucking go.

2574
03:11:02,040 --> 03:11:03,040
We're attacking now.

2575
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:04,800
We're fucking attacking.

2576
03:11:05,700 --> 03:11:08,100
We're fucking attacking now.

2577
03:11:08,500 --> 03:11:09,440
Please.

2578
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:11,300
Please, kill anything.

2579
03:11:19,430 --> 03:11:20,990
Oh my god.

2580
03:11:23,870 --> 03:11:25,690
Oh my god.

2581
03:11:26,670 --> 03:11:28,830
I can't believe it.

2582
03:11:32,830 --> 03:11:34,610
I can't believe it.

2583
03:11:34,810 --> 03:11:37,730
They also went GOATS.

2584
03:11:38,650 --> 03:11:40,630
No, I'm not plat 2, I'm plat 1.

2585
03:11:41,390 --> 03:11:43,270
I'm actually plat 1.

2586
03:11:43,890 --> 03:11:44,730
Look at that.

2587
03:11:45,470 --> 03:11:47,550
That's not me, but like, look at my rank leader.

2588
03:11:51,150 --> 03:11:51,790
Alright.

2589
03:11:53,690 --> 03:11:55,250
Two more games, guys.

2590
03:11:55,250 --> 03:11:56,170
I'm gonna avoid.

2591
03:11:56,310 --> 03:11:57,210
Oh wait, no, I don't need to avoid.

2592
03:11:57,310 --> 03:11:59,970
I don't need to avoid because I can actually play other characters now.

2593
03:12:01,590 --> 03:12:02,550
Am I not plat 1?

2594
03:12:06,100 --> 03:12:07,640
I think I thought I was plat 1.

2595
03:12:08,600 --> 03:12:10,900
No, you're fucking gaslighting me.

2596
03:12:10,940 --> 03:12:12,120
I'm plat 1.

2597
03:12:15,680 --> 03:12:16,980
Two more games.

2598
03:12:18,360 --> 03:12:19,360
Two more games.

2599
03:12:21,080 --> 03:12:21,960
Oh my god, thank god.

2600
03:12:22,200 --> 03:12:23,440
Okay, two more games, guys.

2601
03:12:24,280 --> 03:12:27,480
For those who are like, Doki, but you said three more games like an hour ago.

2602
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:28,440
Guys, two more games.

2603
03:12:28,940 --> 03:12:30,180
Guys, two more games.

2604
03:12:31,240 --> 03:12:33,780
Yeah, you wanna know why I said three more games an hour ago?

2605
03:12:33,840 --> 03:12:34,880
Let me show you my history.

2606
03:12:37,160 --> 03:12:37,520
Yeah.

2607
03:12:38,100 --> 03:12:39,460
And let me show you my...

2608
03:12:44,760 --> 03:12:46,000
I've been looping.

2609
03:12:52,460 --> 03:12:52,820
Alright.

2610
03:12:55,080 --> 03:12:55,900
Oh, new people.

2611
03:12:55,900 --> 03:12:58,060
We're facing similar people.

2612
03:12:58,140 --> 03:12:59,080
Please don't do goats.

2613
03:13:00,440 --> 03:13:02,360
Please don't do...

2614
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:03,940
Please don't do goats.

2615
03:13:08,400 --> 03:13:10,160
Please, I can't.

2616
03:13:11,660 --> 03:13:12,080
Please.

2617
03:13:13,340 --> 03:13:14,000
Those games.

2618
03:13:15,360 --> 03:13:16,060
I can't heal.

2619
03:13:16,240 --> 03:13:17,820
I can't deal with that again.

2620
03:13:18,340 --> 03:13:19,120
I can't.

2621
03:13:23,360 --> 03:13:24,760
Oh my god.

2622
03:13:25,080 --> 03:13:25,680
No!

2623
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:29,640
My stack!

2624
03:13:31,320 --> 03:13:33,020
My stack is...

2625
03:13:40,020 --> 03:13:42,680
My stack wants goats.

2626
03:13:43,560 --> 03:13:44,660
Betrayed.

2627
03:13:45,080 --> 03:13:46,940
Betrayed by...

2628
03:13:50,180 --> 03:13:52,200
Betrayed by my own group.

2629
03:13:55,760 --> 03:13:59,660
I got betrayed by my own group.

2630
03:14:05,580 --> 03:14:06,720
Oh my god.

2631
03:14:06,940 --> 03:14:07,060
Oh my god.

2632
03:14:07,060 --> 03:14:08,040
You wanna win.

2633
03:14:08,520 --> 03:14:09,080
Guys, please.

2634
03:14:09,440 --> 03:14:10,760
But I'm not that close.

2635
03:14:11,340 --> 03:14:12,860
I'm not even one game...

2636
03:14:12,860 --> 03:14:14,440
It's not even my top 500 game.

2637
03:14:18,880 --> 03:14:21,560
Guys, if it was my top 500 game, I would've said it.

2638
03:14:21,840 --> 03:14:22,680
Guys, can we please go goats?

2639
03:14:22,860 --> 03:14:23,400
I'm one off.

2640
03:14:23,600 --> 03:14:24,820
Guys, this is my top 500 game.

2641
03:14:24,920 --> 03:14:25,960
Guys, can we please go goats?

2642
03:14:26,440 --> 03:14:27,900
This is my top 500 game, guys.

2643
03:14:31,400 --> 03:14:33,260
So this is the future.

2644
03:14:33,860 --> 03:14:35,460
Or one future, anyway.

2645
03:14:42,870 --> 03:14:43,710
Oh god.

2646
03:14:50,260 --> 03:14:51,640
Oh, he's so low.

2647
03:14:55,470 --> 03:14:56,270
Oh, what?

2648
03:14:56,330 --> 03:14:57,110
I thought that would hit.

2649
03:14:57,630 --> 03:14:59,150
Oh, we lost one of our supports.

2650
03:15:01,550 --> 03:15:03,270
Oh, we lost both of our...

2651
03:15:03,270 --> 03:15:04,150
It's okay.

2652
03:15:04,330 --> 03:15:06,130
I'm also support, guys.

2653
03:15:06,970 --> 03:15:08,290
Guys, I don't think it worked.

2654
03:15:08,410 --> 03:15:09,490
Guys, I don't...

2655
03:15:09,490 --> 03:15:10,650
We lost.

2656
03:15:12,650 --> 03:15:14,750
Guys, we lost both of our supports, guys.

2657
03:15:24,640 --> 03:15:26,080
It's okay, this will be different.

2658
03:15:29,400 --> 03:15:30,640
It's okay, it'll be different.

2659
03:15:37,460 --> 03:15:39,320
I'm gonna put it on our DPS, actually.

2660
03:15:39,820 --> 03:15:41,240
Because our DPS is a flanker.

2661
03:15:44,560 --> 03:15:45,360
Where are we going?

2662
03:15:50,300 --> 03:15:51,460
I don't know where we're going.

2663
03:15:52,260 --> 03:15:53,240
Where's our other tank?

2664
03:15:56,800 --> 03:15:57,900
Oh, that...

2665
03:15:57,900 --> 03:15:58,060
Oh.

2666
03:15:58,960 --> 03:15:59,580
Oh.

2667
03:16:02,240 --> 03:16:03,280
Hey, guys.

2668
03:16:05,060 --> 03:16:07,140
Hey, guys.

2669
03:16:07,420 --> 03:16:08,260
Are we okay?

2670
03:16:12,120 --> 03:16:13,480
Guys, are you guys okay?

2671
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:20,960
Guys, are you guys okay over there?

2672
03:16:26,060 --> 03:16:27,240
Everything will be fine.

2673
03:16:28,680 --> 03:16:29,280
Oh!

2674
03:16:32,580 --> 03:16:35,100
It's okay, we don't need DPS.

2675
03:16:40,020 --> 03:16:41,040
What was my HP?

2676
03:16:50,490 --> 03:16:52,180
Guys, I don't think goats is working.

2677
03:16:52,440 --> 03:16:53,760
I don't think this team...

2678
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:55,640
This team can do goats yet.

2679
03:16:59,040 --> 03:17:00,740
Three more games, guys.

2680
03:17:01,320 --> 03:17:02,640
Three more games.

2681
03:17:02,640 --> 03:17:02,740
Three more games.

2682
03:17:19,200 --> 03:17:21,940
Guys, I don't think three support works.

2683
03:17:40,270 --> 03:17:40,870
Guys.

2684
03:17:41,470 --> 03:17:42,070
Guys.

2685
03:17:42,890 --> 03:17:43,490
Guys.

2686
03:17:44,190 --> 03:17:46,050
This team does not know how.

2687
03:17:46,490 --> 03:17:49,270
This team does not know how to play goats, guys.

2688
03:17:49,550 --> 03:17:51,550
We're not in Grandmaster yet.

2689
03:17:57,830 --> 03:17:58,310
Guys.

2690
03:17:58,710 --> 03:17:59,770
These guys...

2691
03:17:59,770 --> 03:18:00,530
Thank God, too.

2692
03:18:00,630 --> 03:18:01,250
But thank God.

2693
03:18:01,570 --> 03:18:02,870
Thank God they don't know how to play goats.

2694
03:18:03,110 --> 03:18:05,870
Because then we could swap out goats.

2695
03:18:08,990 --> 03:18:10,590
Guys, three more games.

2696
03:18:11,590 --> 03:18:11,950
Whoopee!

2697
03:18:14,970 --> 03:18:16,430
Three more games!

2698
03:18:21,610 --> 03:18:23,110
Yeah, they don't understand goats yet.

2699
03:18:23,210 --> 03:18:23,770
Thank fucking God.

2700
03:18:24,050 --> 03:18:24,470
They don't...

2701
03:18:36,760 --> 03:18:39,720
And I'm okay with that.

2702
03:18:46,920 --> 03:18:48,780
Where the fuck did our Thor go?

2703
03:18:54,550 --> 03:18:55,070
Okay!

2704
03:19:03,610 --> 03:19:04,150
Alright.

2705
03:19:10,730 --> 03:19:12,530
Jesus Christ.

2706
03:19:17,230 --> 03:19:19,390
Are we...

2707
03:19:20,610 --> 03:19:22,290
Oh, no.

2708
03:19:24,730 --> 03:19:26,570
Am I okay?

2709
03:19:27,630 --> 03:19:28,250
No.

2710
03:19:30,090 --> 03:19:30,750
No.

2711
03:19:42,140 --> 03:19:44,900
Okay, I'm okay.

2712
03:19:47,580 --> 03:19:48,540
I'm okay.

2713
03:19:49,300 --> 03:19:50,620
Where are we hiding from?

2714
03:19:51,300 --> 03:19:52,420
Oh, that guy.

2715
03:19:52,420 --> 03:19:53,300
Yeah.

2716
03:19:56,020 --> 03:20:00,700
We're stuck in this hellhole loop of three to two more games.

2717
03:20:02,460 --> 03:20:03,880
It's always been...

2718
03:20:04,540 --> 03:20:05,520
Three more games!

2719
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:07,280
Two more games!

2720
03:20:07,780 --> 03:20:08,580
Three more ga...

2721
03:20:13,960 --> 03:20:16,100
Three more games!

2722
03:20:16,560 --> 03:20:18,200
Two more games!

2723
03:20:32,610 --> 03:20:33,890
Three more games!

2724
03:20:33,890 --> 03:20:34,830
You're all fine.

2725
03:20:35,050 --> 03:20:36,250
You're all okay.

2726
03:20:38,610 --> 03:20:39,210
Okay.

2727
03:20:39,850 --> 03:20:41,270
Except for you.

2728
03:20:43,650 --> 03:20:46,510
Everybody is fine.

2729
03:20:51,720 --> 03:20:53,000
Nice.

2730
03:20:55,480 --> 03:20:57,540
Three more games!

2731
03:20:58,340 --> 03:20:59,720
Two more games!

2732
03:21:01,360 --> 03:21:03,260
When will this hell end?

2733
03:21:08,760 --> 03:21:09,320
Okay.

2734
03:21:15,670 --> 03:21:16,570
Oh, shit.

2735
03:21:16,870 --> 03:21:17,690
He walled himself up.

2736
03:21:18,550 --> 03:21:20,990
I'm, like, scared to peek because of the...

2737
03:21:21,590 --> 03:21:22,710
the Hanzo.

2738
03:21:25,910 --> 03:21:26,470
Okay.

2739
03:21:27,010 --> 03:21:29,090
Like, I don't know what you want me to do there.

2740
03:21:34,060 --> 03:21:35,780
We're safe down here?

2741
03:21:35,780 --> 03:21:37,480
I think we all...

2742
03:21:43,990 --> 03:21:46,550
We were not safe over there.

2743
03:21:46,810 --> 03:21:47,630
We were...

2744
03:21:47,630 --> 03:21:50,230
We were not safe over there.

2745
03:21:51,310 --> 03:21:52,490
I realized.

2746
03:21:52,770 --> 03:21:53,770
No, we were not.

2747
03:21:57,520 --> 03:21:59,900
I mean, do, like, two or three more fights, I think?

2748
03:22:04,170 --> 03:22:05,230
Jesus Christ, okay.

2749
03:22:06,390 --> 03:22:06,990
Okay.

2750
03:22:07,730 --> 03:22:08,270
Okay!

2751
03:22:09,930 --> 03:22:10,510
Um...

2752
03:22:11,630 --> 03:22:12,210
Yeah.

2753
03:22:13,330 --> 03:22:15,390
That's a little bit too much damage, guys.

2754
03:22:15,970 --> 03:22:16,970
That's a lot of damage.

2755
03:22:25,100 --> 03:22:26,660
I don't know what you want me to do.

2756
03:22:27,200 --> 03:22:28,020
You're just running.

2757
03:22:28,960 --> 03:22:30,000
Oh, my God!

2758
03:22:31,440 --> 03:22:32,480
I healed you!

2759
03:22:35,320 --> 03:22:35,900
Where?

2760
03:22:43,940 --> 03:22:45,960
Okay, that was a fucking...

2761
03:22:45,960 --> 03:22:46,320
Okay.

2762
03:22:46,960 --> 03:22:49,300
I'll give credit where credit's due.

2763
03:22:49,900 --> 03:22:52,300
That was a really good shot.

2764
03:23:05,070 --> 03:23:05,590
Please.

2765
03:23:06,030 --> 03:23:06,970
The tree's 1 HP.

2766
03:23:07,150 --> 03:23:09,370
I'm gonna look into the portal and see what it looks like.

2767
03:23:09,870 --> 03:23:10,950
Oh, my God!

2768
03:23:11,510 --> 03:23:12,970
That's what it looked like.

2769
03:23:16,670 --> 03:23:19,930
That was actually a crazy shot from him.

2770
03:23:20,590 --> 03:23:21,110
I...

2771
03:23:21,110 --> 03:23:22,330
I'm impressed.

2772
03:23:22,650 --> 03:23:23,070
You know what?

2773
03:23:23,150 --> 03:23:24,090
He deserved that.

2774
03:23:28,540 --> 03:23:30,440
No, he was definitely aiming for me.

2775
03:23:30,440 --> 03:23:31,260
He literally...

2776
03:23:31,260 --> 03:23:32,440
He let the shot...

2777
03:23:33,120 --> 03:23:34,020
No, Hanzo main...

2778
03:23:34,020 --> 03:23:34,580
No, Hawkeye.

2779
03:23:34,680 --> 03:23:34,800
Sorry.

2780
03:23:34,880 --> 03:23:36,740
Hawkeye mains are actually scary as fuck.

2781
03:23:41,080 --> 03:23:42,340
Okay, who's carrying, though?

2782
03:23:49,800 --> 03:23:50,240
Sorry.

2783
03:23:50,620 --> 03:23:51,300
Sorry, Wunder.

2784
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:57,040
If you're a good little ace, you get to have my little present.

2785
03:24:08,590 --> 03:24:09,070
Four...

2786
03:24:09,070 --> 03:24:09,770
Three...

2787
03:24:09,770 --> 03:24:10,710
Two...

2788
03:24:10,710 --> 03:24:11,090
One!

2789
03:24:11,270 --> 03:24:12,390
Of course, we're still going.

2790
03:24:13,170 --> 03:24:14,710
I'm still streaming.

2791
03:24:14,930 --> 03:24:17,830
If I'm still streaming, we're still fucking going.

2792
03:24:34,300 --> 03:24:37,500
I need to figure out, like, when you play witch healer.

2793
03:24:37,860 --> 03:24:39,100
Like, when do you play...

2794
03:24:43,080 --> 03:24:44,760
Like, when should I play...

2795
03:24:46,640 --> 03:24:47,680
You know...

2796
03:24:47,680 --> 03:24:49,560
Or, like, Adam and Luna...

2797
03:24:49,560 --> 03:24:54,380
Adam, Jeff, and Mantis, and shit like that.

2798
03:24:54,440 --> 03:24:56,200
Like, when would it be a good time to play...

2799
03:24:56,200 --> 03:24:59,320
Adam, when would it be a good time to play other support?

2800
03:25:02,080 --> 03:25:04,060
I'd like to, like, figure that out.

2801
03:25:05,400 --> 03:25:05,920
Later.

2802
03:25:12,700 --> 03:25:14,000
Oh my god!

2803
03:25:15,480 --> 03:25:16,500
Holy shit!

2804
03:25:17,180 --> 03:25:17,700
Yeah.

2805
03:25:18,820 --> 03:25:20,460
They all got deleted there.

2806
03:25:20,540 --> 03:25:22,240
That was such a good bait!

2807
03:25:22,980 --> 03:25:24,100
Did you guys see that?

2808
03:25:24,500 --> 03:25:27,140
With the Adam ult into the...

2809
03:25:27,860 --> 03:25:29,780
Into the fucking Psylocke ult.

2810
03:25:30,020 --> 03:25:31,620
That was actually such a good ult combo.

2811
03:25:32,080 --> 03:25:33,220
I don't think it was intentional.

2812
03:25:33,480 --> 03:25:34,320
There's no way.

2813
03:25:39,280 --> 03:25:39,800
Nice.

2814
03:25:45,740 --> 03:25:46,780
Oh no!

2815
03:25:47,780 --> 03:25:48,420
Oh no!

2816
03:25:50,260 --> 03:25:50,960
She's one!

2817
03:25:55,480 --> 03:25:56,340
That's fine, we're fine.

2818
03:25:59,810 --> 03:26:00,510
Get him!

2819
03:26:00,790 --> 03:26:01,050
Get him!

2820
03:26:01,290 --> 03:26:01,710
Get him!

2821
03:26:02,110 --> 03:26:02,890
Oh, goodbye.

2822
03:26:03,510 --> 03:26:04,630
Wait, what the fuck?

2823
03:26:09,970 --> 03:26:10,510
I don't need to ult.

2824
03:26:12,090 --> 03:26:13,810
Oh, big B.I.Q.

2825
03:26:14,130 --> 03:26:16,850
It's time to dance!

2826
03:26:17,570 --> 03:26:17,770
Oh!

2827
03:26:19,250 --> 03:26:20,210
Wrong way!

2828
03:26:23,880 --> 03:26:25,280
I'm a little scared, though.

2829
03:26:26,360 --> 03:26:27,260
You and I.

2830
03:26:32,330 --> 03:26:33,050
She's one!

2831
03:26:33,050 --> 03:26:35,250
Oh, that ice was actually clutch.

2832
03:26:39,230 --> 03:26:41,690
Oh my god, that ice was actually clutch.

2833
03:26:46,860 --> 03:26:47,460
Oh!

2834
03:26:48,900 --> 03:26:50,380
Where did he come from?

2835
03:26:51,100 --> 03:26:52,240
Where did he...

2836
03:26:52,240 --> 03:26:53,520
Where did he come from?

2837
03:26:57,080 --> 03:26:59,540
The tree grew in front of me!

2838
03:27:01,180 --> 03:27:03,380
The tree suddenly grew in front of me!

2839
03:27:05,580 --> 03:27:06,540
The tree...

2840
03:27:08,380 --> 03:27:11,280
Where did he come from?

2841
03:27:14,800 --> 03:27:16,820
Guys, two more wins!

2842
03:27:17,180 --> 03:27:18,160
Wait, one more win!

2843
03:27:18,340 --> 03:27:18,840
Two more wins!

2844
03:27:18,960 --> 03:27:19,840
I don't fucking know.

2845
03:27:20,120 --> 03:27:22,580
I don't know if it's exactly Diamond.

2846
03:27:23,200 --> 03:27:25,880
I don't know.

2847
03:27:26,160 --> 03:27:29,620
I don't know where the top 500 is at.

2848
03:27:30,320 --> 03:27:31,800
Where is it even at?

2849
03:27:32,460 --> 03:27:32,700
Okay.

2850
03:27:35,160 --> 03:27:35,720
Alright.

2851
03:27:36,440 --> 03:27:39,360
Oh my god, I hate that guy was on my team last time.

2852
03:27:39,360 --> 03:27:41,360
Alright, if I see...

2853
03:27:41,360 --> 03:27:42,610
Okay, I need to know where...

2854
03:27:44,140 --> 03:27:45,600
Where SK is.

2855
03:27:45,720 --> 03:27:47,780
The moment I see where SK is, then I'll know.

2856
03:27:49,400 --> 03:27:51,360
The fuck is SK on here?

2857
03:27:54,540 --> 03:27:56,680
Guys, I don't see SK on here.

2858
03:27:57,100 --> 03:27:57,440
Wait.

2859
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:00,480
Oh no, it's on Diamond 2 now.

2860
03:28:01,860 --> 03:28:03,020
Guys, it's...

2861
03:28:03,020 --> 03:28:04,760
I think it's two more games.

2862
03:28:06,020 --> 03:28:07,180
We're at...

2863
03:28:07,180 --> 03:28:08,780
We're at...

2864
03:28:08,780 --> 03:28:09,300
Wait.

2865
03:28:11,840 --> 03:28:12,840
Wait, okay.

2866
03:28:16,450 --> 03:28:18,570
There's no top 500 on here.

2867
03:28:19,230 --> 03:28:19,930
Oh no.

2868
03:28:20,890 --> 03:28:21,950
Oh, don't tell me.

2869
03:28:22,610 --> 03:28:24,010
No, it's not.

2870
03:28:25,530 --> 03:28:26,750
Guys, it's not.

2871
03:28:27,730 --> 03:28:28,330
Oh,

2872
03:28:31,800 --> 03:28:33,680
it's not two more games.

2873
03:28:38,600 --> 03:28:39,860
It could be.

2874
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:41,160
It could...

2875
03:28:41,160 --> 03:28:42,380
It could be.

2876
03:28:42,840 --> 03:28:45,240
It could be any amount.

2877
03:28:47,440 --> 03:28:49,300
It could be...

2878
03:28:49,300 --> 03:28:50,640
Oh no, it's Diamond.

2879
03:28:51,480 --> 03:28:53,730
There's a very limited spot.

2880
03:28:56,660 --> 03:28:57,800
Oh no.

2881
03:28:58,640 --> 03:28:59,640
I don't know.

2882
03:29:02,680 --> 03:29:03,400
Oh my god.

2883
03:29:03,460 --> 03:29:05,540
Top 500 is far?

2884
03:29:06,400 --> 03:29:08,080
Don't say that.

2885
03:29:08,460 --> 03:29:10,020
What number are you?

2886
03:29:14,390 --> 03:29:16,870
It's 80 points?

2887
03:29:20,930 --> 03:29:21,910
What?

2888
03:29:27,670 --> 03:29:30,350
Okay, it's three more.

2889
03:29:33,870 --> 03:29:35,150
It's...

2890
03:29:35,730 --> 03:29:36,370
It's...

2891
03:29:36,890 --> 03:29:38,250
It's three more.

2892
03:29:39,710 --> 03:29:40,790
Guys.

2893
03:29:42,050 --> 03:29:43,510
It's three more.

2894
03:29:44,890 --> 03:29:46,510
Welcome to hell.

2895
03:29:47,090 --> 03:29:49,230
It's three more.

2896
03:29:52,090 --> 03:29:53,310
No, it is.

2897
03:29:53,370 --> 03:29:55,070
Because you gain 30 points.

2898
03:29:55,250 --> 03:29:59,510
You can gain 30 points per win.

2899
03:30:00,010 --> 03:30:02,070
So, like, it's three more.

2900
03:30:02,930 --> 03:30:04,970
Because I'm at 90 points.

2901
03:30:05,090 --> 03:30:06,770
And if I win, then it'll be 20...

2902
03:30:06,770 --> 03:30:08,150
It'll be 20 something.

2903
03:30:09,030 --> 03:30:12,430
And if I win again, it'll be 60.

2904
03:30:12,790 --> 03:30:15,590
And if I win again, it'll be top 500.

2905
03:30:16,650 --> 03:30:18,010
That's how math works.

2906
03:30:22,740 --> 03:30:23,420
Guys.

2907
03:30:24,120 --> 03:30:24,560
Three more.

2908
03:30:25,760 --> 03:30:27,480
We're back to three.

2909
03:30:27,740 --> 03:30:30,980
Every time we win, we're back to three.

2910
03:30:39,210 --> 03:30:40,970
Just three more.

2911
03:30:42,630 --> 03:30:43,530
This is it.

2912
03:30:44,590 --> 03:30:45,930
We're always three more.

2913
03:30:46,290 --> 03:30:47,410
This is actually feel...

2914
03:30:47,410 --> 03:30:49,130
It's the fucking...

2915
03:30:49,130 --> 03:30:50,510
It's the answer to life.

2916
03:30:50,650 --> 03:30:51,910
It's just always three more.

2917
03:30:55,860 --> 03:30:58,740
As bad as things get, I tried to stay calm.

2918
03:30:58,740 --> 03:31:00,140
This is my fucking highlight.

2919
03:31:01,140 --> 03:31:02,880
So, I might be rusty.

2920
03:31:03,060 --> 03:31:04,380
30 seconds before you attack.

2921
03:31:04,700 --> 03:31:05,260
Get ready.

2922
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:07,760
Fear thyself.

2923
03:31:08,080 --> 03:31:08,580
I'm not this.

2924
03:31:08,700 --> 03:31:09,320
I believe in you.

2925
03:31:09,740 --> 03:31:11,240
Oh my god, we're actually doing goats.

2926
03:31:11,780 --> 03:31:14,380
We're actually doing goats.

2927
03:31:16,180 --> 03:31:17,700
Oh my god, we...

2928
03:31:18,460 --> 03:31:19,980
There's gonna be hero bans, right?

2929
03:31:19,980 --> 03:31:21,820
The moment we hit diamond lobbies...

2930
03:31:21,820 --> 03:31:22,560
DPS boost.

2931
03:31:24,240 --> 03:31:28,840
The moment we hit diamond lobbies, we're gonna have like full hero bans, right?

2932
03:31:30,640 --> 03:31:32,340
No one's gonna ban Luna.

2933
03:31:33,380 --> 03:31:34,920
Who's gonna fucking ban Luna?

2934
03:31:36,100 --> 03:31:38,520
What kind of freak's gonna do that?

2935
03:31:46,640 --> 03:31:47,660
There's no way.

2936
03:31:47,960 --> 03:31:48,920
There's so many...

2937
03:31:48,920 --> 03:31:49,560
At best...

2938
03:31:49,560 --> 03:31:52,120
At best, they're gonna try to ban Hella first.

2939
03:31:56,320 --> 03:31:57,520
That's why I believe.

2940
03:32:05,320 --> 03:32:06,560
That's why I believe.

2941
03:32:14,280 --> 03:32:15,740
Oh no, we're going higher.

2942
03:32:16,060 --> 03:32:17,400
No, we're going higher.

2943
03:32:22,850 --> 03:32:23,930
If I can heal this guy.

2944
03:32:24,210 --> 03:32:24,450
Woah!

2945
03:32:32,690 --> 03:32:33,070
Fine.

2946
03:32:33,950 --> 03:32:34,510
Everything...

2947
03:32:34,510 --> 03:32:35,610
It's not fine.

2948
03:32:36,390 --> 03:32:38,430
I don't feel fine anymore.

2949
03:32:43,380 --> 03:32:45,300
No, he's back as hell!

2950
03:32:53,320 --> 03:32:55,620
That's fine, we got 30%.

2951
03:32:55,620 --> 03:32:56,600
Guys, no.

2952
03:32:56,800 --> 03:32:57,540
It's three left.

2953
03:32:59,080 --> 03:32:59,380
Yes.

2954
03:32:59,940 --> 03:33:00,760
It's three left.

2955
03:33:01,480 --> 03:33:02,020
It's...

2956
03:33:02,020 --> 03:33:04,340
We're eternally at three left.

2957
03:33:07,560 --> 03:33:09,320
It's just always three left.

2958
03:33:15,910 --> 03:33:17,450
It's going high.

2959
03:33:17,570 --> 03:33:18,030
It's going high.

2960
03:33:30,180 --> 03:33:31,320
We're fine, right?

2961
03:33:35,760 --> 03:33:36,760
Let's heal again.

2962
03:33:36,980 --> 03:33:37,380
It's fine.

2963
03:33:40,120 --> 03:33:40,920
My turn!

2964
03:33:43,540 --> 03:33:44,800
Wait, where's everybody?

2965
03:33:48,260 --> 03:33:50,480
It's still my turn!

2966
03:33:55,480 --> 03:33:56,680
Oh, we lost one.

2967
03:33:57,260 --> 03:33:57,980
That's not good.

2968
03:33:58,360 --> 03:33:59,660
Oh, and then I got...

2969
03:33:59,660 --> 03:34:00,180
That's not...

2970
03:34:00,180 --> 03:34:00,860
Also not good.

2971
03:34:01,900 --> 03:34:03,160
Oh, that's not good.

2972
03:34:03,160 --> 03:34:04,740
He's gonna get respawned, guys.

2973
03:34:05,880 --> 03:34:07,420
I'm worried about that.

2974
03:34:15,250 --> 03:34:15,890
He's here.

2975
03:34:17,850 --> 03:34:18,690
I'm good.

2976
03:34:20,170 --> 03:34:21,130
Jesus Christ!

2977
03:34:21,570 --> 03:34:23,310
Our healer takes so much damage!

2978
03:34:31,520 --> 03:34:32,320
It's fine.

2979
03:34:32,800 --> 03:34:33,260
We're fine.

2980
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:35,760
I'm just peeking the stairs.

2981
03:34:36,260 --> 03:34:37,640
Oh my god!

2982
03:34:37,640 --> 03:34:39,020
I'm on one.

2983
03:34:39,580 --> 03:34:40,300
Oh!

2984
03:34:44,120 --> 03:34:45,420
Big viking!

2985
03:34:46,040 --> 03:34:47,340
Tries to pound!

2986
03:34:48,880 --> 03:34:49,580
Small woman!

2987
03:34:51,540 --> 03:34:52,660
Save me!

2988
03:34:56,640 --> 03:34:58,020
Alright, we're fine.

2989
03:35:02,040 --> 03:35:04,180
Oh my god, the viking's back!

2990
03:35:08,040 --> 03:35:09,140
It's fine.

2991
03:35:10,260 --> 03:35:11,260
We killed the viking.

2992
03:35:12,220 --> 03:35:13,300
It's just like...

2993
03:35:13,300 --> 03:35:14,740
It's just like American Horror Story.

2994
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:16,540
You know, the witch scene?

2995
03:35:20,200 --> 03:35:22,460
Oh my god, things look dire, but it worked.

2996
03:35:23,200 --> 03:35:23,760
It worked.

2997
03:35:23,940 --> 03:35:26,680
Things looked really dire, but it's working.

2998
03:35:36,880 --> 03:35:38,240
Oh, you guys never heard...

2999
03:35:38,240 --> 03:35:39,660
Watch American Horror Story?

3000
03:35:43,230 --> 03:35:44,370
Or is that scene?

3001
03:35:45,010 --> 03:35:46,790
Okay, so like...

3002
03:35:46,790 --> 03:35:47,550
Spoiler alert!

3003
03:35:47,550 --> 03:35:50,930
But like, American Horror Story is like every season, it's a new story.

3004
03:35:51,130 --> 03:35:53,430
And then the thing is, it's like really fucked...

3005
03:35:53,430 --> 03:35:55,470
One of the story is like really fucked up.

3006
03:35:55,790 --> 03:36:00,470
So like, these girls discover they're witches by having like powers manifest.

3007
03:36:01,270 --> 03:36:07,570
And then like, one of these girls' powers was that if you try to bang her, you die.

3008
03:36:09,110 --> 03:36:15,890
And she found out because like, her boyfriend was like, let's do it.

3009
03:36:15,890 --> 03:36:17,730
And then she's like, okay.

3010
03:36:17,990 --> 03:36:18,770
Like, you know.

3011
03:36:18,950 --> 03:36:19,910
And then, you know.

3012
03:36:20,010 --> 03:36:21,690
And then he fucking dies.

3013
03:36:28,010 --> 03:36:29,530
That's basically it.

3014
03:36:29,890 --> 03:36:31,850
And I was like, that's a fucked up power.

3015
03:36:33,610 --> 03:36:36,050
That's actually a fucked up power.

3016
03:36:36,410 --> 03:36:39,630
And then the other witches have like real fucking power.

3017
03:36:40,710 --> 03:36:41,450
And everything.

3018
03:36:41,450 --> 03:36:46,910
Like, some of them are like power of nature or like resurrection power.

3019
03:36:47,410 --> 03:36:55,930
This fucker's power is that she can't fuck because any guy she tries to bang fucking dies.

3020
03:36:59,630 --> 03:37:01,410
So it's like...

3021
03:37:01,410 --> 03:37:02,810
It's like...

3022
03:37:03,210 --> 03:37:04,890
Bro, that sucks, you know?

3023
03:37:05,270 --> 03:37:08,450
Like, compared to everybody else and her fucking...

3024
03:37:09,270 --> 03:37:10,990
Jesus Christ, QM.

3025
03:37:14,190 --> 03:37:15,690
What is this?

3026
03:37:17,330 --> 03:37:18,710
What the...

3027
03:37:18,710 --> 03:37:18,990
Huh?

3028
03:37:20,870 --> 03:37:21,950
What?

3029
03:37:23,390 --> 03:37:24,470
Huh?

3030
03:37:24,790 --> 03:37:25,630
Woah!

3031
03:37:27,290 --> 03:37:28,370
Woah!

3032
03:37:28,990 --> 03:37:29,730
Guys!

3033
03:37:30,990 --> 03:37:34,330
Guys, that's a lot of fucking damage.

3034
03:37:36,270 --> 03:37:37,590
Yeah, it's limited...

3035
03:37:37,590 --> 03:37:39,310
Yes, it's limited to men.

3036
03:37:39,310 --> 03:37:41,510
Because it's her...

3037
03:37:41,510 --> 03:37:44,070
It's her virginity that causes it.

3038
03:37:44,930 --> 03:37:47,410
The power is stored in the virginity.

3039
03:38:04,870 --> 03:38:06,550
Wait, don't... What happened to her?

3040
03:38:06,750 --> 03:38:07,050
Oh!

3041
03:38:07,790 --> 03:38:09,450
He DC'd!

3042
03:38:10,310 --> 03:38:13,330
I was gonna say, why is this so much harder?

3043
03:38:14,430 --> 03:38:16,210
I just realized.

3044
03:38:16,950 --> 03:38:20,050
I didn't even notice he was fucking gone.

3045
03:38:23,970 --> 03:38:25,890
That makes a lot more sense now.

3046
03:38:27,470 --> 03:38:28,430
That's fucked.

3047
03:38:33,470 --> 03:38:34,670
We should at least just get a bot.

3048
03:38:36,750 --> 03:38:38,550
We actually have a DC.

3049
03:38:39,450 --> 03:38:39,970
Like...

3050
03:38:39,970 --> 03:38:41,290
When did he DC?

3051
03:38:44,130 --> 03:38:45,850
I was like, we have one tank.

3052
03:38:45,890 --> 03:38:46,590
I didn't even realize.

3053
03:38:52,790 --> 03:38:54,290
Oh, that's actually fucked too.

3054
03:38:55,970 --> 03:38:58,590
I think at that point we have to run a DPS.

3055
03:39:13,620 --> 03:39:14,160
Oh no.

3056
03:39:14,660 --> 03:39:15,560
Oh no!

3057
03:39:16,180 --> 03:39:17,100
Our only tank!

3058
03:39:33,920 --> 03:39:35,080
Alright, nice.

3059
03:39:37,780 --> 03:39:39,820
We should get like, stat bonus.

3060
03:39:39,820 --> 03:39:43,160
Like, you basically get XP.

3061
03:39:43,940 --> 03:39:45,600
Ult charge twice as fast.

3062
03:39:45,940 --> 03:39:46,520
If you have a lever.

3063
03:39:49,140 --> 03:39:50,820
Guys, I don't think we should push up.

3064
03:39:51,440 --> 03:39:52,300
Guys, yes.

3065
03:39:56,120 --> 03:39:57,280
I'm so low.

3066
03:39:59,260 --> 03:40:00,420
Oh my god, we lived.

3067
03:40:00,580 --> 03:40:01,720
Oh my god, he's back!

3068
03:40:03,360 --> 03:40:04,740
Welcome back bro, we're winning.

3069
03:40:07,700 --> 03:40:09,120
Oh no, don't say that.

3070
03:40:09,120 --> 03:40:09,820
No!

3071
03:40:13,880 --> 03:40:16,200
Welcome back bro, we're winning.

3072
03:40:29,660 --> 03:40:32,020
Welcome back bro, we're winning.

3073
03:40:32,260 --> 03:40:33,060
Fucking dies.

3074
03:40:39,440 --> 03:40:40,580
Oh hey.

3075
03:40:46,810 --> 03:40:47,810
There we go.

3076
03:40:48,210 --> 03:40:49,870
Don't worry, I saved your life.

3077
03:40:50,010 --> 03:40:51,470
No need to thank me.

3078
03:40:55,390 --> 03:40:56,330
There we go.

3079
03:40:56,930 --> 03:40:58,210
Oh, okay, that's fine.

3080
03:40:58,310 --> 03:40:59,150
We did it!

3081
03:41:05,270 --> 03:41:07,910
We actually won a 5v6.

3082
03:41:09,610 --> 03:41:10,750
That's crazy.

3083
03:41:11,510 --> 03:41:12,630
We're just that good.

3084
03:41:13,530 --> 03:41:14,990
We're just that good.

3085
03:41:16,770 --> 03:41:18,830
Oh my god, we're in diamond now.

3086
03:41:19,110 --> 03:41:20,430
We're in diamond.

3087
03:41:20,850 --> 03:41:22,310
But we still need three.

3088
03:41:22,790 --> 03:41:24,650
We still need two more games.

3089
03:41:24,730 --> 03:41:25,110
Yes!

3090
03:41:26,990 --> 03:41:31,170
We're 99.92% better.

3091
03:41:33,230 --> 03:41:34,510
Than all of you.

3092
03:41:36,990 --> 03:41:39,230
We're out of the plat mines.

3093
03:41:40,170 --> 03:41:42,730
We're out of the plat mines.

3094
03:41:44,290 --> 03:41:44,790
Oh my god.

3095
03:41:44,790 --> 03:41:46,830
Actual two more games.

3096
03:41:47,130 --> 03:41:48,490
Two more games.

3097
03:41:49,010 --> 03:41:50,790
It's two more games.

3098
03:41:55,470 --> 03:41:57,290
People never ban Luna.

3099
03:41:57,490 --> 03:41:58,750
They always ban a DPS.

3100
03:41:58,950 --> 03:42:00,430
What kind of freak will ban Luna?

3101
03:42:02,090 --> 03:42:04,610
You have one ban and you pick Luna.

3102
03:42:08,340 --> 03:42:09,480
There's no way.

3103
03:42:10,380 --> 03:42:13,940
I believe society would not do that to me.

3104
03:42:14,080 --> 03:42:15,700
Oh my god, I'm literally right here.

3105
03:42:15,700 --> 03:42:16,920
I'm so close.

3106
03:42:18,060 --> 03:42:20,100
I hope all of these people lose.

3107
03:42:25,080 --> 03:42:27,520
There's only a hundred spots left.

3108
03:42:29,560 --> 03:42:32,880
There's only a hundred spots left.

3109
03:42:38,170 --> 03:42:39,150
Yes, you can.

3110
03:42:39,210 --> 03:42:39,770
Yes, of course.

3111
03:42:39,910 --> 03:42:41,070
You can always drop back down.

3112
03:42:44,170 --> 03:42:45,390
There's no way.

3113
03:42:46,190 --> 03:42:48,550
We're in actual diamond lobbies.

3114
03:42:48,650 --> 03:42:50,270
How does hero ban work?

3115
03:42:54,910 --> 03:42:55,790
Wait.

3116
03:43:01,030 --> 03:43:03,450
How does hero ban work then?

3117
03:43:17,680 --> 03:43:18,820
Yes, see?

3118
03:43:19,240 --> 03:43:19,660
See?

3119
03:43:19,660 --> 03:43:21,640
Everyone picks Hella.

3120
03:43:22,120 --> 03:43:23,120
Yes!

3121
03:43:28,660 --> 03:43:30,200
I'm free.

3122
03:43:34,740 --> 03:43:36,780
Oh wait, you ban two?

3123
03:43:37,440 --> 03:43:38,120
Yeah, fuck off.

3124
03:43:38,240 --> 03:43:39,860
Yeah, that's right.

3125
03:43:45,200 --> 03:43:45,460
Alright.

3126
03:43:50,700 --> 03:43:51,700
No

3127
03:43:58,250 --> 03:44:01,110
one cares about banning Luna.

3128
03:44:04,960 --> 03:44:07,340
Sorry, Esky, but it's...

3129
03:44:08,600 --> 03:44:10,180
It's a risk we gotta take.

3130
03:44:16,740 --> 03:44:18,360
It's a risk we gotta take.

3131
03:44:30,440 --> 03:44:31,120
Let's go.

3132
03:44:31,220 --> 03:44:32,380
Wait, are we going goats again?

3133
03:44:33,200 --> 03:44:34,360
Oh my god.

3134
03:44:35,840 --> 03:44:36,320
Okay.

3135
03:44:36,900 --> 03:44:38,640
We can make this work again.

3136
03:44:39,160 --> 03:44:40,140
We have Storm.

3137
03:44:40,400 --> 03:44:41,100
I mean, we're in diamond.

3138
03:44:41,300 --> 03:44:42,060
It should be fine.

3139
03:44:42,380 --> 03:44:43,740
Everybody's really good in this ELO.

3140
03:44:44,900 --> 03:44:46,220
We're in diamond lobbies now.

3141
03:44:54,400 --> 03:44:55,360
That's fine.

3142
03:44:56,740 --> 03:44:57,820
We're in diamond.

3143
03:44:58,080 --> 03:44:58,660
It's fine.

3144
03:44:59,820 --> 03:45:00,340
It's fine.

3145
03:45:00,400 --> 03:45:01,100
We've made it.

3146
03:45:01,640 --> 03:45:03,020
We've made it, guys.

3147
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:04,960
Two more games.

3148
03:45:05,580 --> 03:45:06,720
Two more games.

3149
03:45:07,200 --> 03:45:09,080
Two more games!

3150
03:45:14,140 --> 03:45:16,600
And then we're top 500 for a day.

3151
03:45:18,940 --> 03:45:21,960
We get to be...

3152
03:45:21,960 --> 03:45:23,820
Top 500 for a fucking day.

3153
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:27,840
Holy shit.

3154
03:45:31,430 --> 03:45:33,770
What the fuck?

3155
03:45:38,070 --> 03:45:38,990
How?

3156
03:45:48,200 --> 03:45:49,120
Jesus.

3157
03:45:49,940 --> 03:45:52,140
How much damage are y'all taking?

3158
03:45:56,220 --> 03:45:57,820
Who is it?

3159
03:46:05,860 --> 03:46:08,280
Oh my god, everybody's taking so much damage.

3160
03:46:17,380 --> 03:46:18,540
Jesus Christ.

3161
03:46:22,260 --> 03:46:23,580
Oh my god.

3162
03:46:23,800 --> 03:46:26,360
I have ult, but like...

3163
03:46:26,360 --> 03:46:27,540
I don't even know this.

3164
03:46:28,580 --> 03:46:30,980
Okay, now it's definitely worth it.

3165
03:46:32,340 --> 03:46:33,040
Like...

3166
03:46:33,040 --> 03:46:33,840
Now it's...

3167
03:46:33,840 --> 03:46:35,160
Oh my god.

3168
03:46:36,980 --> 03:46:38,140
I don't...

3169
03:46:38,140 --> 03:46:39,000
I don't know.

3170
03:46:40,580 --> 03:46:41,200
Guys.

3171
03:46:43,400 --> 03:46:47,300
Guys, I don't know if their support is working right now.

3172
03:46:47,300 --> 03:46:48,540
Okay, yeah.

3173
03:46:49,240 --> 03:46:51,660
Yeah, when I'm ace right now...

3174
03:46:51,660 --> 03:46:53,840
Yeah, I think we need a little bit more DPS.

3175
03:47:04,170 --> 03:47:05,970
Jesus Christ, these games.

3176
03:47:18,510 --> 03:47:19,510
Oh my god.

3177
03:47:19,950 --> 03:47:20,310
Guys.

3178
03:47:20,870 --> 03:47:21,450
Guys.

3179
03:47:23,030 --> 03:47:24,150
Oh my god.

3180
03:47:24,570 --> 03:47:25,450
Guys, I need help.

3181
03:47:25,990 --> 03:47:26,670
I need help.

3182
03:47:27,050 --> 03:47:27,950
They're all there.

3183
03:47:30,850 --> 03:47:31,590
Okay, guys.

3184
03:47:32,450 --> 03:47:33,350
We get like...

3185
03:47:33,350 --> 03:47:34,270
One kill.

3186
03:47:34,270 --> 03:47:35,890
That'd be pretty neat.

3187
03:47:36,930 --> 03:47:42,190
That'd be pretty neat, guys.

3188
03:47:42,690 --> 03:47:43,070
Neato.

3189
03:47:44,310 --> 03:47:45,510
I don't even know...

3190
03:47:46,150 --> 03:47:47,670
I think it's just a team diff.

3191
03:47:51,600 --> 03:47:52,840
Oh my god.

3192
03:47:54,820 --> 03:47:57,680
That Punisher is fucking crazy.

3193
03:47:59,020 --> 03:48:00,600
He has 15 kills.

3194
03:48:07,360 --> 03:48:07,920
Hmm.

3195
03:48:10,800 --> 03:48:11,360
Hmm.

3196
03:48:13,460 --> 03:48:14,780
Yeah, that's a...

3197
03:48:14,780 --> 03:48:15,100
Hmm.

3198
03:48:24,160 --> 03:48:25,560
Yeah, this is...

3199
03:48:25,560 --> 03:48:27,200
That's a little awkward, guys.

3200
03:48:27,560 --> 03:48:28,840
That's a little awkward.

3201
03:48:29,220 --> 03:48:29,860
Don't worry.

3202
03:48:30,100 --> 03:48:31,620
This game will be different, right guys?

3203
03:48:32,000 --> 03:48:32,420
Right?

3204
03:48:32,800 --> 03:48:34,100
This game's gonna be different now.

3205
03:48:34,160 --> 03:48:35,320
Guys, three more games now.

3206
03:48:35,580 --> 03:48:35,900
Guys.

3207
03:48:36,300 --> 03:48:37,040
Three more games.

3208
03:48:38,260 --> 03:48:38,560
Three more games.

3209
03:48:38,560 --> 03:48:43,920
We're stuck in a loop of two and then three.

3210
03:48:44,240 --> 03:48:46,580
When will it stop?

3211
03:48:51,100 --> 03:48:52,800
When will it stop?

3212
03:48:55,940 --> 03:49:03,180
Oh my god, he also...

3213
03:49:04,380 --> 03:49:06,560
I hate this because like...

3214
03:49:06,560 --> 03:49:08,340
I keep going back to the portal.

3215
03:49:08,340 --> 03:49:09,780
So it's like...

3216
03:49:10,340 --> 03:49:10,880
What?

3217
03:49:11,300 --> 03:49:11,440
Why?

3218
03:49:13,120 --> 03:49:14,080
Going back in.

3219
03:49:14,480 --> 03:49:15,380
Get me back in.

3220
03:49:15,500 --> 03:49:16,520
Get me back in.

3221
03:49:16,820 --> 03:49:18,320
I don't want to be back in.

3222
03:49:20,020 --> 03:49:22,300
I don't want to be there anymore.

3223
03:49:22,980 --> 03:49:25,360
I don't want to be there anymore.

3224
03:49:30,450 --> 03:49:31,530
I survived.

3225
03:49:31,930 --> 03:49:33,230
But at what cost?

3226
03:49:33,350 --> 03:49:34,930
I watched all my friends die.

3227
03:49:35,510 --> 03:49:36,030
What?

3228
03:49:49,300 --> 03:49:53,180
Oh, we don't get it again because everybody is so alive.

3229
03:49:57,020 --> 03:49:58,240
Guys, give me a sec.

3230
03:49:58,320 --> 03:50:01,020
You're all taking an exceptionally amount...

3231
03:50:01,020 --> 03:50:02,960
Large amount of damage, everybody.

3232
03:50:03,720 --> 03:50:07,380
That is very, very hard to heal, everybody.

3233
03:50:08,100 --> 03:50:09,780
Oh my god, is that...

3234
03:50:09,780 --> 03:50:10,700
Oh my god, we got killed.

3235
03:50:24,550 --> 03:50:25,490
Oh my god.

3236
03:50:33,820 --> 03:50:34,880
Oh, no!

3237
03:50:36,540 --> 03:50:37,460
No!

3238
03:50:45,000 --> 03:50:48,540
I didn't see the fucking Doctor Strange!

3239
03:50:57,910 --> 03:50:59,750
Jesus Christ.

3240
03:51:04,180 --> 03:51:04,900
Poor guy.

3241
03:51:07,060 --> 03:51:09,240
I don't know if we lived this.

3242
03:51:10,000 --> 03:51:12,500
But I will try my best...

3243
03:51:12,500 --> 03:51:14,800
To just start swimming.

3244
03:51:16,700 --> 03:51:18,880
Just start dancing.

3245
03:51:20,800 --> 03:51:22,480
Hey guys, we should touch the point.

3246
03:51:24,600 --> 03:51:25,680
Yay!

3247
03:51:29,340 --> 03:51:30,540
Three more games.

3248
03:51:31,540 --> 03:51:33,300
Three more games.

3249
03:51:33,760 --> 03:51:35,180
Three more...

3250
03:51:36,460 --> 03:51:38,380
Three more games!

3251
03:51:44,540 --> 03:51:45,780
Three more games!

3252
03:51:48,580 --> 03:51:50,280
I'm stuck in hell.

3253
03:51:53,360 --> 03:51:54,620
I'm actually...

3254
03:51:54,620 --> 03:51:56,380
I'm stuck in fucking hell.

3255
03:51:57,120 --> 03:52:02,500
Three more fucking games!

3256
03:52:03,240 --> 03:52:04,200
I'll grab a snack.

3257
03:52:04,640 --> 03:52:05,620
I haven't had lunch.

3258
03:52:07,200 --> 03:52:08,040
I...

3259
03:52:08,040 --> 03:52:08,960
Tokyo tonight?

3260
03:52:09,400 --> 03:52:10,240
Yes.

3261
03:52:11,060 --> 03:52:11,960
I'll be right back.

3262
03:53:02,460 --> 03:53:02,940
Back.

3263
03:53:04,060 --> 03:53:05,080
I got myself...

3264
03:53:06,100 --> 03:53:07,080
I got myself...

3265
03:53:08,980 --> 03:53:09,940
A tangerine.

3266
03:53:11,360 --> 03:53:12,300
I haven't had one...

3267
03:53:12,300 --> 03:53:13,120
Actually, no, JK.

3268
03:53:13,220 --> 03:53:14,980
I haven't had one on stream in a while.

3269
03:53:15,120 --> 03:53:17,100
But I've been eating tangerines off stream.

3270
03:53:19,620 --> 03:53:20,100
Um...

3271
03:53:20,100 --> 03:53:21,080
Because I went on...

3272
03:53:21,660 --> 03:53:22,320
Whole Foods.

3273
03:53:23,300 --> 03:53:25,200
I'm never buying from Whole Foods again, by the way.

3274
03:53:26,580 --> 03:53:27,060
Um...

3275
03:53:27,060 --> 03:53:28,540
Whole Foods is a fucking scam.

3276
03:53:28,540 --> 03:53:28,740
Fuck.

3277
03:53:31,840 --> 03:53:34,240
Tokyo, I'm never gonna get sponsored by Whole Foods again.

3278
03:53:35,120 --> 03:53:35,560
No.

3279
03:53:39,340 --> 03:53:41,020
I saw they had tangerines.

3280
03:53:41,600 --> 03:53:42,360
So I was like, yeah.

3281
03:53:42,920 --> 03:53:43,760
I didn't realize...

3282
03:53:44,220 --> 03:53:45,900
You know, they're supposed to be more healthy.

3283
03:53:47,600 --> 03:53:48,560
But like...

3284
03:53:48,560 --> 03:53:49,580
Oh, there's...

3285
03:53:49,580 --> 03:53:50,280
Oh, there's somebody.

3286
03:53:50,840 --> 03:53:52,260
There's somebody that's not Diamond.

3287
03:53:52,620 --> 03:53:53,580
No hero bands.

3288
03:53:53,760 --> 03:53:54,320
Thank God.

3289
03:53:55,640 --> 03:53:56,600
But like...

3290
03:53:56,600 --> 03:53:57,900
Basically, like...

3291
03:53:58,540 --> 03:54:00,360
I didn't realize Whole Foods...

3292
03:54:00,360 --> 03:54:01,040
Was like, you know...

3293
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:02,500
I know it's like mostly like...

3294
03:54:02,500 --> 03:54:03,000
Expensive.

3295
03:54:03,120 --> 03:54:03,640
More expensive.

3296
03:54:03,880 --> 03:54:04,320
Because...

3297
03:54:04,320 --> 03:54:05,680
But I didn't realize it was just...

3298
03:54:06,760 --> 03:54:07,400
Organic.

3299
03:54:07,760 --> 03:54:08,700
And gluten-free.

3300
03:54:09,360 --> 03:54:10,320
Because I was like...

3301
03:54:10,320 --> 03:54:12,160
I want something not gluten-free.

3302
03:54:12,620 --> 03:54:13,200
But like...

3303
03:54:13,200 --> 03:54:15,000
Their entire pasta aisle...

3304
03:54:15,000 --> 03:54:16,820
Was like gluten-free pasta.

3305
03:54:17,560 --> 03:54:18,160
I was like...

3306
03:54:18,160 --> 03:54:20,340
I don't fucking want gluten-free pasta.

3307
03:54:20,800 --> 03:54:22,840
I want regular pasta.

3308
03:54:29,400 --> 03:54:30,200
Yeah.

3309
03:54:30,580 --> 03:54:31,540
So like...

3310
03:54:32,220 --> 03:54:33,280
Made me angry.

3311
03:54:35,580 --> 03:54:37,620
I got angry.

3312
03:54:39,300 --> 03:54:41,960
I wanted regular pasta.

3313
03:54:46,790 --> 03:54:50,050
Yeah, so I'm never buying from Whole Foods again.

3314
03:54:50,530 --> 03:54:51,950
I wasted so much money.

3315
03:54:55,970 --> 03:54:57,170
Because I was already there.

3316
03:54:57,770 --> 03:54:59,310
I was already there.

3317
03:54:59,910 --> 03:55:00,290
Oh my god.

3318
03:55:00,390 --> 03:55:01,270
And then I bought like...

3319
03:55:01,270 --> 03:55:02,310
I bought like a...

3320
03:55:03,610 --> 03:55:04,090
Tag...

3321
03:55:04,090 --> 03:55:05,510
What is it called?

3322
03:55:06,130 --> 03:55:06,890
The pasta.

3323
03:55:07,130 --> 03:55:07,510
It starts...

3324
03:55:07,510 --> 03:55:08,610
I don't know how to pronounce it.

3325
03:55:08,970 --> 03:55:09,570
I know how...

3326
03:55:09,570 --> 03:55:10,710
I know how to...

3327
03:55:10,710 --> 03:55:11,830
Spell it.

3328
03:55:12,270 --> 03:55:12,910
The tag...

3329
03:55:14,090 --> 03:55:14,570
Something.

3330
03:55:14,810 --> 03:55:15,070
I don't know.

3331
03:55:15,210 --> 03:55:15,730
I gotta focus.

3332
03:55:15,930 --> 03:55:16,010
Fuck.

3333
03:55:16,810 --> 03:55:17,810
Gotta keep people alive.

3334
03:55:19,670 --> 03:55:21,050
Gotta keep people alive.

3335
03:55:21,370 --> 03:55:23,250
I tried to keep people alive.

3336
03:55:23,330 --> 03:55:24,610
But it was not possible.

3337
03:55:25,690 --> 03:55:27,050
It was not possible.

3338
03:55:28,950 --> 03:55:30,650
Well, we'll talk about this later.

3339
03:55:33,350 --> 03:55:35,310
I don't know what he expected.

3340
03:55:37,750 --> 03:55:38,230
I...

3341
03:55:38,230 --> 03:55:40,190
All I did was left click.

3342
03:55:43,130 --> 03:55:44,390
They take so much damage.

3343
03:55:44,490 --> 03:55:45,610
I might put it on tank instead.

3344
03:55:47,410 --> 03:55:49,070
Because these are like flanking tanks.

3345
03:55:58,000 --> 03:56:00,840
Yeah, our tanks are like both...

3346
03:56:01,820 --> 03:56:04,840
I'm gonna go fucking in and just start fucking brawling.

3347
03:56:05,420 --> 03:56:07,280
They're both like...

3348
03:56:07,280 --> 03:56:07,960
What's it called?

3349
03:56:08,540 --> 03:56:10,120
Tanks that wanna fucking fight.

3350
03:56:25,720 --> 03:56:27,420
Can't heal this myself.

3351
03:56:34,940 --> 03:56:36,640
Can we touch?

3352
03:56:40,300 --> 03:56:41,080
Oh.

3353
03:56:41,580 --> 03:56:42,220
Woah.

3354
03:56:42,600 --> 03:56:43,430
Woah, that's...

3355
03:56:43,840 --> 03:56:44,600
Woah.

3356
03:56:44,600 --> 03:56:46,280
Woah, that's unlucky.

3357
03:56:47,840 --> 03:56:48,480
Woah.

3358
03:56:49,380 --> 03:56:51,360
Woah, I might be dead too.

3359
03:56:56,850 --> 03:56:57,490
Guys.

3360
03:56:58,370 --> 03:56:59,010
Guys.

3361
03:56:59,290 --> 03:57:01,250
Guys, there's a tank right here.

3362
03:57:01,410 --> 03:57:03,090
There's two tankies right here.

3363
03:57:03,710 --> 03:57:04,170
There's...

3364
03:57:04,170 --> 03:57:05,890
There's two tanks right here.

3365
03:57:07,750 --> 03:57:09,430
Oh my god, he's still there!

3366
03:57:13,760 --> 03:57:14,780
The tag...

3367
03:57:14,780 --> 03:57:15,340
Tag...

3368
03:57:16,240 --> 03:57:16,880
Gelate...

3369
03:57:16,880 --> 03:57:17,280
Noodles.

3370
03:57:17,980 --> 03:57:18,940
I was like...

3371
03:57:18,940 --> 03:57:19,820
Oh, I love those!

3372
03:57:19,940 --> 03:57:22,500
But they tasted terrible because they were the gluten-free version.

3373
03:57:24,760 --> 03:57:28,140
I'm sorry if you guys like gluten-free noodles, but I was not feeling it.

3374
03:57:29,060 --> 03:57:30,680
I was not fucking feeling it.

3375
03:57:31,920 --> 03:57:33,140
I was so sad.

3376
03:57:33,260 --> 03:57:34,740
It tasted so fucking weird.

3377
03:57:35,580 --> 03:57:36,500
Oh no.

3378
03:57:37,620 --> 03:57:39,380
I'm gonna be a mindless foreigner.

3379
03:57:43,200 --> 03:57:45,060
I don't know...

3380
03:57:53,140 --> 03:57:53,660
AGAIN?!

3381
03:57:53,660 --> 03:57:54,880
Just need to know.

3382
03:57:55,260 --> 03:57:55,760
It knows.

3383
03:57:56,480 --> 03:57:58,720
You got the most healing out of everybody.

3384
03:58:07,810 --> 03:58:09,390
Oh my god.

3385
03:58:09,810 --> 03:58:10,150
Nice.

3386
03:58:15,700 --> 03:58:16,460
Okay, it's fine.

3387
03:58:18,420 --> 03:58:19,580
Oh, I'm 90%.

3388
03:58:20,900 --> 03:58:21,500
96.

3389
03:58:23,280 --> 03:58:26,580
I finally learned how to hide in the corner when I hear hello.

3390
03:58:27,140 --> 03:58:29,460
No longer am I gonna fucking...

3391
03:58:29,460 --> 03:58:30,280
Fucking...

3392
03:58:32,260 --> 03:58:35,720
I shall no longer look at things like that anymore.

3393
03:58:36,060 --> 03:58:37,560
I finally learned.

3394
03:58:41,200 --> 03:58:42,460
Oh my god.

3395
03:58:42,560 --> 03:58:44,320
Use this because you're all so low.

3396
03:58:46,620 --> 03:58:48,700
I'm a little worried here.

3397
03:58:57,240 --> 03:58:58,240
Oh shit.

3398
03:58:58,480 --> 03:58:59,020
JK.

3399
03:58:59,260 --> 03:59:00,400
Why am I fucking worried?

3400
03:59:02,820 --> 03:59:04,280
Oh my god.

3401
03:59:04,280 --> 03:59:05,160
He could've again-ed us.

3402
03:59:05,280 --> 03:59:06,560
He could've again-ed us.

3403
03:59:07,840 --> 03:59:08,340
Nice.

3404
03:59:09,100 --> 03:59:10,060
I finally learned.

3405
03:59:10,140 --> 03:59:12,560
Okay, I'm still trying to peel the stupid tangerine.

3406
03:59:13,280 --> 03:59:13,700
But yeah.

3407
03:59:15,300 --> 03:59:16,240
I'm not...

3408
03:59:16,240 --> 03:59:18,800
I'm not gonna buy from Whole Foods again after that.

3409
03:59:19,120 --> 03:59:21,660
I was so unhappy about my pasta.

3410
03:59:22,240 --> 03:59:24,120
Because I was so excited because I was like...

3411
03:59:24,120 --> 03:59:24,500
I've never...

3412
03:59:24,500 --> 03:59:28,360
I haven't had the Tagliatelle latte noodles in a long time.

3413
03:59:29,340 --> 03:59:30,140
And then I'm gonna...

3414
03:59:30,140 --> 03:59:31,440
I'm gonna...

3415
03:59:31,440 --> 03:59:32,200
I can't wait.

3416
03:59:32,520 --> 03:59:33,280
Oh my god.

3417
03:59:33,280 --> 03:59:36,340
I can't wait to make some new pasta today.

3418
03:59:38,660 --> 03:59:40,980
And then I was so disappointed.

3419
03:59:49,600 --> 03:59:50,180
I just...

3420
03:59:50,180 --> 03:59:51,000
This is so weird.

3421
03:59:51,240 --> 03:59:52,980
I've never had gluten-free noodles before.

3422
03:59:53,980 --> 03:59:54,700
I'm honest.

3423
03:59:54,800 --> 03:59:56,140
I've never had gluten-free noodles.

3424
04:00:04,160 --> 04:00:04,640
So...

3425
04:00:06,440 --> 04:00:08,260
So I was just like...

3426
04:00:08,260 --> 04:00:09,240
I was just like, you know...

3427
04:00:09,240 --> 04:00:10,260
I wanna try something new.

3428
04:00:11,020 --> 04:00:12,580
And then I said like, whip eggs.

3429
04:00:13,340 --> 04:00:14,340
By the way, what does gluten...

3430
04:00:14,340 --> 04:00:15,360
What is gluten-free anyway?

3431
04:00:21,020 --> 04:00:21,940
Also like...

3432
04:00:21,940 --> 04:00:23,800
What the fuck is gluten-free?

3433
04:00:28,200 --> 04:00:30,440
I don't even know what that means.

3434
04:00:33,380 --> 04:00:34,470
No wheat or...

3435
04:00:35,920 --> 04:00:37,840
Wait, no wheat or flour?

3436
04:00:38,620 --> 04:00:39,820
Oh my god!

3437
04:00:43,300 --> 04:00:44,100
Oh shit.

3438
04:00:46,760 --> 04:00:48,580
That's basically pasta!

3439
04:00:49,520 --> 04:00:51,060
No wonder it tastes like dog shit.

3440
04:00:51,140 --> 04:00:51,640
Holy shit.

3441
04:00:51,780 --> 04:00:52,220
I'm sorry.

3442
04:00:53,220 --> 04:00:55,240
I'm sorry to eat gluten-free stuff.

3443
04:00:55,540 --> 04:00:57,260
But it did not taste good.

3444
04:01:09,200 --> 04:01:09,720
Okay.

3445
04:01:10,580 --> 04:01:11,040
Oh my god.

3446
04:01:11,100 --> 04:01:13,160
If I knew that meant no wheat or flour...

3447
04:01:13,160 --> 04:01:15,980
I would not have fucking ate that shit.

3448
04:01:18,040 --> 04:01:19,740
I would not have bought that.

3449
04:01:20,180 --> 04:01:21,090
I was just like...

3450
04:01:23,060 --> 04:01:23,720
Hmm...

3451
04:01:23,720 --> 04:01:24,600
It's expensive.

3452
04:01:25,520 --> 04:01:26,520
Maybe it's good.

3453
04:01:27,580 --> 04:01:28,980
Little do I know.

3454
04:01:30,620 --> 04:01:32,980
It was literally one of the worst pastas I've ever had.

3455
04:01:37,360 --> 04:01:37,880
Nice.

3456
04:01:41,100 --> 04:01:42,180
We did it.

3457
04:01:47,000 --> 04:01:48,980
We did it.

3458
04:01:48,980 --> 04:01:49,360
Yay!

3459
04:01:49,900 --> 04:01:51,380
No, three more games, guys.

3460
04:01:52,600 --> 04:01:53,580
Three more games.

3461
04:01:57,300 --> 04:01:58,700
Oh my god!

3462
04:01:59,320 --> 04:01:59,920
Okay.

3463
04:02:00,580 --> 04:02:01,360
I got scared.

3464
04:02:01,500 --> 04:02:03,600
I saw the portal and I saw fear.

3465
04:02:06,800 --> 04:02:08,720
I had fear in my eyes.

3466
04:02:14,070 --> 04:02:14,710
Nice.

3467
04:02:16,930 --> 04:02:17,390
Nice.

3468
04:02:19,850 --> 04:02:20,710
Oh my god.

3469
04:02:21,470 --> 04:02:22,330
Two more games!

3470
04:02:23,130 --> 04:02:24,590
Two more games!

3471
04:02:25,810 --> 04:02:26,310
Guys!

3472
04:02:27,330 --> 04:02:29,510
Guys, two more games, everybody!

3473
04:02:30,690 --> 04:02:31,390
Guys!

3474
04:02:33,370 --> 04:02:36,210
Guys, two more games.

3475
04:02:37,490 --> 04:02:39,230
We're so close.

3476
04:02:41,710 --> 04:02:43,430
Two more games!

3477
04:02:44,410 --> 04:02:44,650
Okay.

3478
04:02:44,970 --> 04:02:46,430
Three, six...

3479
04:02:46,430 --> 04:02:47,630
Yeah, two more games.

3480
04:02:47,910 --> 04:02:48,530
Fully two more...

3481
04:02:48,530 --> 04:02:49,670
It's actually...

3482
04:02:49,670 --> 04:02:50,430
Actual real.

3483
04:02:50,870 --> 04:02:51,850
No, it's two games.

3484
04:02:51,930 --> 04:02:53,290
There's still a hundred spots left.

3485
04:02:54,150 --> 04:02:57,950
There's still a hundred spots left in top 500.

3486
04:02:58,330 --> 04:03:00,210
So it's still two more games.

3487
04:03:01,690 --> 04:03:03,450
That's so interesting though.

3488
04:03:03,570 --> 04:03:04,950
The banning thing.

3489
04:03:07,590 --> 04:03:09,970
The ban system is incredibly interesting.

3490
04:03:11,890 --> 04:03:13,550
Okay, we're playing three supports.

3491
04:03:14,450 --> 04:03:16,590
Okay, we have no tank plays.

3492
04:03:17,470 --> 04:03:18,010
Okay.

3493
04:03:19,390 --> 04:03:20,470
Oh no.

3494
04:03:21,270 --> 04:03:21,570
Hello?

3495
04:03:25,380 --> 04:03:26,840
I won't say hello.

3496
04:03:33,310 --> 04:03:34,090
Oh, Hawkeye?

3497
04:03:34,250 --> 04:03:34,790
That's fine.

3498
04:03:35,150 --> 04:03:35,410
Oh.

3499
04:03:40,250 --> 04:03:41,550
What do we do now?

3500
04:03:44,390 --> 04:03:45,590
I don't fucking know.

3501
04:03:46,630 --> 04:03:47,270
Magneto?

3502
04:03:47,470 --> 04:03:49,130
What if we just ban Dr. Strange?

3503
04:03:52,550 --> 04:03:53,590
Black Panther?

3504
04:03:55,990 --> 04:03:57,130
Black Panther?

3505
04:03:57,450 --> 04:03:59,310
Who the fuck plays Black Panther?

3506
04:04:03,250 --> 04:04:04,030
Ha ha ha!

3507
04:04:04,190 --> 04:04:04,790
Okay.

3508
04:04:16,760 --> 04:04:18,560
Yeah, Sylark got picked.

3509
04:04:19,060 --> 04:04:20,120
We don't have a tank player.

3510
04:04:35,940 --> 04:04:37,320
Guys, this is bad.

3511
04:04:37,540 --> 04:04:38,400
We don't...

3512
04:04:38,400 --> 04:04:39,720
We don't have...

3513
04:04:39,720 --> 04:04:42,660
We don't have a tank player.

3514
04:04:44,240 --> 04:04:47,700
Oh, and of course it's on this dogshit fucking map.

3515
04:04:48,300 --> 04:04:49,020
Fucking course.

3516
04:04:49,220 --> 04:04:50,220
Guys, three more games.

3517
04:04:52,420 --> 04:04:53,780
No tank player.

3518
04:04:54,360 --> 04:04:56,000
Guys, three more games.

3519
04:05:09,100 --> 04:05:11,240
It never ends.

3520
04:05:11,880 --> 04:05:13,920
It never fucking ends.

3521
04:05:15,240 --> 04:05:15,840
Four...

3522
04:05:15,840 --> 04:05:16,760
Three...

3523
04:05:16,760 --> 04:05:17,880
Two...

3524
04:05:17,880 --> 04:05:18,220
One!

3525
04:05:19,260 --> 04:05:22,920
Don't forget, securing the mission area is your top priority.

3526
04:05:24,240 --> 04:05:25,640
Hell is my realm.

3527
04:05:26,160 --> 04:05:28,560
But sooner will not be the only one.

3528
04:05:28,740 --> 04:05:29,480
They won't know.

3529
04:05:31,100 --> 04:05:31,600
They won't...

3530
04:05:31,600 --> 04:05:33,800
How does this TP shit look like?

3531
04:05:36,580 --> 04:05:39,340
I always feel like it takes so long.

3532
04:05:39,840 --> 04:05:42,460
Even like for people who know what the fuck they're doing.

3533
04:05:53,480 --> 04:05:54,120
Oh, we got a kill.

3534
04:05:54,480 --> 04:05:55,320
Look at that.

3535
04:05:55,640 --> 04:05:56,220
Good for him.

3536
04:05:58,400 --> 04:05:59,520
Oh, we got two kills.

3537
04:05:59,660 --> 04:06:00,320
Good for them.

3538
04:06:04,200 --> 04:06:04,720
Oh.

3539
04:06:04,900 --> 04:06:05,660
Oh my god.

3540
04:06:18,110 --> 04:06:19,490
Oh my god, I live.

3541
04:06:19,930 --> 04:06:20,870
Fucking idiots.

3542
04:06:23,190 --> 04:06:24,370
That's fucking right.

3543
04:06:24,970 --> 04:06:26,110
I live.

3544
04:06:31,150 --> 04:06:32,730
Oh, you gotta move?

3545
04:06:32,730 --> 04:06:35,530
So they're basically walking to the area?

3546
04:06:37,070 --> 04:06:38,090
Oh, that's interesting.

3547
04:06:38,330 --> 04:06:39,210
I didn't know that.

3548
04:06:39,910 --> 04:06:44,430
So they actually have to walk to the area they want to TP in?

3549
04:06:44,810 --> 04:06:45,910
Bro, that's fucked.

3550
04:06:46,670 --> 04:06:48,810
I don't know why it takes so long.

3551
04:06:52,070 --> 04:06:55,070
They're literally fucking traveling over.

3552
04:07:05,910 --> 04:07:08,210
Trying to figure out when to use this ult here.

3553
04:07:10,990 --> 04:07:11,830
Oh, okay.

3554
04:07:12,070 --> 04:07:12,790
That's fine.

3555
04:07:17,440 --> 04:07:19,140
Oh no, he's on the mushroom.

3556
04:07:24,440 --> 04:07:25,380
That's fine.

3557
04:07:25,780 --> 04:07:29,320
We have no support ults now, so what happens, happens.

3558
04:07:32,800 --> 04:07:35,020
Okay, um, yeah.

3559
04:07:36,400 --> 04:07:37,640
There was nothing I could do there.

3560
04:07:37,780 --> 04:07:38,400
Sorry, buddy.

3561
04:07:40,400 --> 04:07:41,000
Sorry.

3562
04:07:49,060 --> 04:07:49,540
Reload.

3563
04:07:50,640 --> 04:07:51,820
You have to turn around.

3564
04:07:52,240 --> 04:07:54,260
You have to turn around again.

3565
04:07:54,860 --> 04:07:55,280
No!

3566
04:08:03,030 --> 04:08:04,410
Okay, that's actually funny.

3567
04:08:04,570 --> 04:08:05,890
I did not know you had to walk.

3568
04:08:06,190 --> 04:08:07,790
You have to walk to the place.

3569
04:08:08,710 --> 04:08:11,370
It's like, it's literally Google mapping.

3570
04:08:13,530 --> 04:08:16,810
You're fucking pulling a Google map, being like, where the fuck do I go?

3571
04:08:27,220 --> 04:08:28,120
Oh my god.

3572
04:08:33,730 --> 04:08:34,670
Where the fuck?

3573
04:08:37,030 --> 04:08:38,930
Wanted on Widowmaker?

3574
04:08:39,790 --> 04:08:43,630
This is the first time I've seen a Natasha.

3575
04:08:45,690 --> 04:08:50,450
I don't think I've ever seen one this entire in rank.

3576
04:08:51,250 --> 04:08:51,810
This is actually...

3577
04:08:54,350 --> 04:08:56,130
Oh my god!

3578
04:08:58,170 --> 04:08:58,850
Wait!

3579
04:08:59,470 --> 04:09:02,030
I didn't realize we TP'd into them!

3580
04:09:05,970 --> 04:09:07,430
I was so surprised.

3581
04:09:08,150 --> 04:09:11,170
I never realized we actually went into them.

3582
04:09:22,360 --> 04:09:23,120
Alright.

3583
04:09:23,660 --> 04:09:25,800
I'm gonna go to SK because she's been carrying.

3584
04:09:26,820 --> 04:09:30,600
Whoever's a good ace gets to have this little gift.

3585
04:09:32,940 --> 04:09:34,780
Just gonna have to get regular healing now, Hella.

3586
04:09:36,480 --> 04:09:38,640
Gotta deal with regular good old healers.

3587
04:09:48,350 --> 04:09:49,110
Oh!

3588
04:09:49,570 --> 04:09:50,570
That's fine.

3589
04:09:51,150 --> 04:09:53,230
That is totally fine.

3590
04:09:53,230 --> 04:09:55,690
Because we're dancing.

3591
04:09:57,010 --> 04:09:57,410
Yeah!

3592
04:09:58,630 --> 04:10:00,350
You wanna keep dancing, everybody?

3593
04:10:01,070 --> 04:10:02,970
You wanna keep dancing?

3594
04:10:04,330 --> 04:10:04,990
Oh!

3595
04:10:05,170 --> 04:10:05,770
Stop dancing!

3596
04:10:06,330 --> 04:10:07,590
The dancing has stopped!

3597
04:10:08,850 --> 04:10:10,250
The dancing has stopped!

3598
04:10:12,030 --> 04:10:13,690
We went too far.

3599
04:10:14,770 --> 04:10:16,710
We danced too hard, guys.

3600
04:10:19,270 --> 04:10:21,230
Guys, we should've stopped dancing.

3601
04:10:24,010 --> 04:10:26,330
We definitely should've stopped dancing.

3602
04:10:39,880 --> 04:10:40,860
That's fine.

3603
04:10:50,210 --> 04:10:51,210
Oh my god.

3604
04:10:51,350 --> 04:10:52,650
I'm just gonna do this.

3605
04:10:53,170 --> 04:10:54,550
Because you're all grouped up anyway.

3606
04:11:00,530 --> 04:11:01,170
Fine.

3607
04:11:05,980 --> 04:11:07,000
Alright, nice.

3608
04:11:08,440 --> 04:11:09,680
Okay, not nice.

3609
04:11:10,820 --> 04:11:12,180
Oh, that is definitely not nice.

3610
04:11:12,260 --> 04:11:13,120
I'm fucking...

3611
04:11:13,120 --> 04:11:14,960
I'm gonna skate away.

3612
04:11:15,680 --> 04:11:17,440
It's time to skate away.

3613
04:11:22,120 --> 04:11:23,180
Wait, who's over there?

3614
04:11:25,440 --> 04:11:27,440
Why did you live that long?

3615
04:11:34,370 --> 04:11:36,050
Alright, we gotta go!

3616
04:11:47,180 --> 04:11:48,780
I'm fucking...

3617
04:11:48,780 --> 04:11:49,300
Let's go!

3618
04:11:49,720 --> 04:11:50,060
No!

3619
04:11:50,840 --> 04:11:52,540
I couldn't touch it!

3620
04:11:56,860 --> 04:12:00,160
We couldn't touch it!

3621
04:12:05,340 --> 04:12:07,840
Oh, that's fucked.

3622
04:12:18,580 --> 04:12:22,720
Three more games, guys.

3623
04:12:23,540 --> 04:12:25,200
Three more games.

3624
04:12:25,500 --> 04:12:26,500
Bro!

3625
04:12:27,120 --> 04:12:28,140
Oh my god.

3626
04:12:28,400 --> 04:12:29,900
It truly is hell.

3627
04:12:39,750 --> 04:12:40,510
Damn.

3628
04:12:51,530 --> 04:12:52,730
Damn, that's fucked.

3629
04:12:53,210 --> 04:12:54,450
That's so fucked.

3630
04:13:02,390 --> 04:13:04,790
See, this is why we need roll heal.

3631
04:13:08,470 --> 04:13:12,910
You see, this is exactly why we need roll Q, guys.

3632
04:13:48,580 --> 04:13:53,880
A nice deep freeze.

3633
04:13:55,520 --> 04:13:56,720
Jesus Christ.

3634
04:13:59,400 --> 04:14:01,040
Oh, that's bad.

3635
04:14:01,820 --> 04:14:02,540
Three more...

3636
04:14:02,540 --> 04:14:03,820
Three more games.

3637
04:14:09,080 --> 04:14:10,380
Bro, this Gatsby guy.

3638
04:14:10,480 --> 04:14:11,700
All he does is complain.

3639
04:14:15,580 --> 04:14:16,700
Bro, he...

3640
04:14:16,700 --> 04:14:20,420
He doesn't even have top kills for the king.

3641
04:14:21,380 --> 04:14:22,260
For Hella.

3642
04:14:25,900 --> 04:14:26,580
Their...

3643
04:14:26,580 --> 04:14:27,880
Their ace is a Hella.

3644
04:14:28,280 --> 04:14:30,020
Where's our fucking Hella ace?

3645
04:14:45,150 --> 04:14:45,870
Oh my god.

3646
04:14:46,210 --> 04:14:47,810
Oh my god!

3647
04:14:47,890 --> 04:14:48,850
It's like a Bastion!

3648
04:14:52,540 --> 04:14:55,900
That felt like looking at a fucking Bastion right there.

3649
04:14:56,440 --> 04:14:57,540
Oh, he got...

3650
04:14:58,880 --> 04:14:59,560
What?!

3651
04:15:06,540 --> 04:15:09,520
That's literally like a Bastion turret.

3652
04:15:11,200 --> 04:15:12,520
I'm opening a portal.

3653
04:15:12,540 --> 04:15:13,400
Hella, please!

3654
04:15:14,920 --> 04:15:16,440
To be fair, our strange build.

3655
04:15:16,740 --> 04:15:17,220
I don't think...

3656
04:15:17,220 --> 04:15:18,920
We had zero tank players.

3657
04:15:19,600 --> 04:15:20,580
We got three more games.

3658
04:15:21,700 --> 04:15:22,740
God, that's fucking...

3659
04:15:22,740 --> 04:15:23,560
I'm in purgatory.

3660
04:15:23,780 --> 04:15:25,260
I'm actually stuck in purgatory.

3661
04:15:26,120 --> 04:15:27,240
I'm fucking...

3662
04:15:30,560 --> 04:15:33,820
I'm stuck in this purgatory of three to two more games.

3663
04:15:34,420 --> 04:15:34,860
I've...

3664
04:15:34,860 --> 04:15:36,980
I've only had one occasion.

3665
04:15:38,840 --> 04:15:40,580
I only had...

3666
04:15:40,580 --> 04:15:40,820
Whoa.

3667
04:15:41,120 --> 04:15:41,360
Okay.

3668
04:15:41,840 --> 04:15:42,400
Okay.

3669
04:15:43,460 --> 04:15:44,180
Okay.

3670
04:15:57,360 --> 04:15:59,280
Bro needs to touch me.

3671
04:16:05,140 --> 04:16:05,860
Alright.

3672
04:16:06,900 --> 04:16:08,520
Dude, I'm stuck in this hell.

3673
04:16:08,540 --> 04:16:08,960
Oh, whoa.

3674
04:16:10,180 --> 04:16:11,320
Oh, whoa.

3675
04:16:12,680 --> 04:16:13,640
Oh, whoa.

3676
04:16:14,780 --> 04:16:15,480
Just...

3677
04:16:15,480 --> 04:16:15,800
Whoa.

3678
04:16:17,210 --> 04:16:18,020
Oh, fuck.

3679
04:16:18,120 --> 04:16:20,500
We got Gatsby on our team too.

3680
04:16:21,210 --> 04:16:21,560
Bro!

3681
04:16:21,940 --> 04:16:23,400
We got Gatsby!

3682
04:16:23,580 --> 04:16:25,440
We have three people there!

3683
04:16:25,560 --> 04:16:26,700
Hella, babes!

3684
04:16:28,480 --> 04:16:28,920
Guys.

3685
04:16:30,160 --> 04:16:32,440
Guys, we gotta start avoiding people.

3686
04:16:35,250 --> 04:16:38,520
Guys, we gotta start avoiding people.

3687
04:16:40,640 --> 04:16:41,000
Lmao.

3688
04:16:41,480 --> 04:16:43,680
I thought they avoided him!

3689
04:16:44,500 --> 04:16:47,240
I legitimately thought they avoided him!

3690
04:16:57,710 --> 04:16:59,410
Guys, I think we have four more games.

3691
04:17:00,410 --> 04:17:01,630
Oh, they ban Hella too.

3692
04:17:01,770 --> 04:17:02,130
Nice.

3693
04:17:03,450 --> 04:17:04,090
See, I told you.

3694
04:17:04,150 --> 04:17:05,370
They always ban DPS.

3695
04:17:10,860 --> 04:17:12,440
I like how the guy picked Hawkeye.

3696
04:17:12,500 --> 04:17:13,260
I was like, yeah, you know what?

3697
04:17:13,320 --> 04:17:14,280
Yeah, fuck Hawkeye.

3698
04:17:20,440 --> 04:17:22,380
Oh, even they were like, yeah, fuck Hawkeye.

3699
04:17:23,200 --> 04:17:25,200
Oh my god, this is...

3700
04:17:26,280 --> 04:17:27,420
My fucking hellhole.

3701
04:17:28,750 --> 04:17:30,440
My fucking...

3702
04:17:31,200 --> 04:17:32,040
Hellhole.

3703
04:17:34,930 --> 04:17:36,320
My personal hell.

3704
04:17:37,660 --> 04:17:38,940
That's three to two games.

3705
04:17:41,930 --> 04:17:43,460
Three to two games.

3706
04:17:48,630 --> 04:17:51,590
I can never escape.

3707
04:17:52,550 --> 04:17:53,990
I chose this.

3708
04:17:55,970 --> 04:17:57,250
I told you.

3709
04:17:59,690 --> 04:18:00,870
I told you.

3710
04:18:00,990 --> 04:18:02,830
Everybody's like, wow, escape!

3711
04:18:03,110 --> 04:18:03,650
Woah, what?

3712
04:18:04,310 --> 04:18:05,310
Nobody's asking.

3713
04:18:06,130 --> 04:18:07,290
Woah, Jokey bro.

3714
04:18:07,450 --> 04:18:08,870
Okay, to be fair, some people did.

3715
04:18:09,130 --> 04:18:09,670
But like...

3716
04:18:10,430 --> 04:18:11,090
But like...

3717
04:18:14,530 --> 04:18:16,450
But like, you know.

3718
04:18:18,490 --> 04:18:19,670
But like, you know.

3719
04:18:20,450 --> 04:18:21,170
There's me.

3720
04:18:23,890 --> 04:18:25,590
I'm pretty cool too.

3721
04:18:26,810 --> 04:18:27,350
I'm pretty cool.

3722
04:18:27,350 --> 04:18:28,330
Unless you're on the enemy team.

3723
04:18:28,770 --> 04:18:31,510
You're banned if you steal my ELO.

3724
04:18:33,010 --> 04:18:36,890
If you're on enemy team and you fucking go like, woah, Jokey!

3725
04:18:37,010 --> 04:18:38,090
And I lose to you.

3726
04:18:41,290 --> 04:18:43,730
Don't make me find your name.

3727
04:18:58,680 --> 04:18:58,900
Alright.

3728
04:19:01,480 --> 04:19:02,660
I'm going in.

3729
04:19:04,440 --> 04:19:05,720
Guys, I'm like...

3730
04:19:05,720 --> 04:19:08,140
Oh my god, this actually fucking confuses me sometimes.

3731
04:19:15,540 --> 04:19:16,220
Nice.

3732
04:19:22,640 --> 04:19:23,940
Jesus Christ.

3733
04:19:24,300 --> 04:19:25,760
Everybody's taking so much damage.

3734
04:19:27,620 --> 04:19:31,100
Oh, it's because we have like a fucking squirrel girl one trick.

3735
04:19:31,760 --> 04:19:34,080
Which is basically like a Junkrat one trick.

3736
04:19:40,400 --> 04:19:42,300
So much damage.

3737
04:19:43,800 --> 04:19:44,960
And I'm scared.

3738
04:19:46,000 --> 04:19:47,760
I'm fine.

3739
04:19:52,560 --> 04:19:53,660
I feel so safe.

3740
04:19:56,800 --> 04:19:57,980
Oh my god.

3741
04:19:58,140 --> 04:19:58,540
Okay.

3742
04:19:58,540 --> 04:19:59,760
Except for that guy.

3743
04:20:09,040 --> 04:20:11,840
Oh no, he's getting...

3744
04:20:15,980 --> 04:20:16,460
Reload.

3745
04:20:21,090 --> 04:20:21,570
No!

3746
04:20:23,490 --> 04:20:23,770
I

3747
04:20:32,340 --> 04:20:33,220
bought a...

3748
04:20:33,220 --> 04:20:35,240
It's okay, we got a point at least.

3749
04:20:36,800 --> 04:20:38,920
We actually got fucked over by the jump.

3750
04:20:39,040 --> 04:20:39,740
Wait, I still have a point.

3751
04:20:39,900 --> 04:20:40,260
Let's go.

3752
04:20:43,640 --> 04:20:44,820
Oh my god.

3753
04:20:45,320 --> 04:20:47,260
I jumped off.

3754
04:20:50,260 --> 04:20:52,380
Dance alone on my stage.

3755
04:20:52,520 --> 04:20:54,160
Becoming a solo act.

3756
04:20:55,360 --> 04:20:57,380
I didn't wanna be Beyoncé.

3757
04:20:59,940 --> 04:21:01,760
Wait, but I held the point though.

3758
04:21:02,740 --> 04:21:03,160
You know what?

3759
04:21:03,220 --> 04:21:04,220
I held the point though.

3760
04:21:06,860 --> 04:21:08,220
Where is...

3761
04:21:09,920 --> 04:21:10,600
Goodbye.

3762
04:21:14,260 --> 04:21:14,940
Goodbye.

3763
04:21:16,160 --> 04:21:16,840
You...

3764
04:21:18,260 --> 04:21:19,460
It was just...

3765
04:21:19,460 --> 04:21:22,180
You just can't live that at that point.

3766
04:21:31,470 --> 04:21:31,950
Okay.

3767
04:21:41,180 --> 04:21:42,540
Oh my god.

3768
04:21:43,140 --> 04:21:43,620
Woah.

3769
04:21:44,400 --> 04:21:46,240
I think that guy just got solo ulted.

3770
04:21:46,400 --> 04:21:46,880
Woah!

3771
04:21:48,220 --> 04:21:50,520
I think I just saw him get solo ulted.

3772
04:21:56,110 --> 04:21:57,390
Oh, I thought I got him.

3773
04:22:01,000 --> 04:22:02,480
I think I have squirrel ult now.

3774
04:22:12,240 --> 04:22:13,140
I'm gonna reload my hands.

3775
04:22:13,540 --> 04:22:14,120
I'm sorry.

3776
04:22:20,240 --> 04:22:21,200
You're alive.

3777
04:22:26,240 --> 04:22:28,060
You're alive for a little bit longer.

3778
04:22:33,950 --> 04:22:34,810
God, okay.

3779
04:22:35,150 --> 04:22:36,270
You're alive a little...

3780
04:22:36,270 --> 04:22:37,670
Oh my god, please.

3781
04:22:38,450 --> 04:22:41,350
Why does no one wanna dance with me?

3782
04:22:44,330 --> 04:22:47,230
Why does no one wanna dance with me?

3783
04:22:51,070 --> 04:22:53,710
Oh, he got shielded?

3784
04:22:54,950 --> 04:22:56,950
Oh my god.

3785
04:22:58,670 --> 04:23:02,390
That would've hit if he didn't get shielded.

3786
04:23:05,890 --> 04:23:07,950
That's actually so fucked.

3787
04:23:12,570 --> 04:23:13,430
Guys.

3788
04:23:14,690 --> 04:23:15,670
Four more games.

3789
04:23:16,490 --> 04:23:18,090
Guys, this is not looking good.

3790
04:23:19,470 --> 04:23:21,990
We gotta start avoiding other DPS players.

3791
04:23:27,270 --> 04:23:29,490
This is not looking good.

3792
04:23:31,370 --> 04:23:34,230
We gotta start avoiding DPS players now.

3793
04:23:34,330 --> 04:23:35,090
We've made it.

3794
04:23:35,350 --> 04:23:36,830
Guys, we finally made it.

3795
04:23:37,390 --> 04:23:40,290
Diamond is the elo where there's too many DPS players.

3796
04:23:40,810 --> 04:23:43,790
Plat is the hell where there's too many support players.

3797
04:23:49,350 --> 04:23:52,190
I don't even know who's like doing well in our team.

3798
04:23:52,410 --> 04:23:53,610
Like, who should get this?

3799
04:23:55,910 --> 04:23:56,790
Three more games.

3800
04:23:57,990 --> 04:23:58,530
Literally.

3801
04:24:01,010 --> 04:24:02,230
Literally three more games.

3802
04:24:04,890 --> 04:24:06,870
Literally three more games.

3803
04:24:08,190 --> 04:24:09,430
Three more fucking games.

3804
04:24:10,690 --> 04:24:11,830
Four games actually.

3805
04:24:11,930 --> 04:24:12,770
Four more games.

3806
04:24:26,180 --> 04:24:27,320
This is where we die.

3807
04:24:27,580 --> 04:24:28,500
This is where I die.

3808
04:24:28,720 --> 04:24:30,280
This is where I die.

3809
04:24:38,180 --> 04:24:40,020
Wait, Gatsby swapped to squirrel.

3810
04:24:41,000 --> 04:24:41,540
It's over.

3811
04:24:41,800 --> 04:24:42,540
He's mindbroken.

3812
04:24:43,480 --> 04:24:44,040
He's done.

3813
04:24:47,340 --> 04:24:48,880
He's fucking done done.

3814
04:25:02,020 --> 04:25:03,240
Yay, I'm again!

3815
04:25:05,080 --> 04:25:05,960
Yay, I'm again!

3816
04:25:12,980 --> 04:25:13,620
Is it again?

3817
04:25:13,620 --> 04:25:14,700
Oh shit!

3818
04:25:14,860 --> 04:25:15,660
Okay, that was crazy.

3819
04:25:22,370 --> 04:25:23,690
Oh, I froze somebody.

3820
04:25:30,440 --> 04:25:32,700
I even stood in front of...

3821
04:25:32,700 --> 04:25:34,960
I even went to stand in front of her.

3822
04:25:35,560 --> 04:25:38,180
I even stood in front of her.

3823
04:25:40,360 --> 04:25:41,900
Guys, I'm coming back, please.

3824
04:25:41,900 --> 04:25:44,340
We are undefeated!

3825
04:25:52,550 --> 04:25:53,370
Guys, again?

3826
04:25:56,030 --> 04:25:57,650
I'm just going to play on the support for now.

3827
04:26:04,690 --> 04:26:05,750
I'm going to play on wanted.

3828
04:26:15,020 --> 04:26:15,880
Just one.

3829
04:26:16,060 --> 04:26:17,380
Oh my god, he's so low!

3830
04:26:23,230 --> 04:26:24,290
Oh, who is it?

3831
04:26:25,450 --> 04:26:26,410
Who is it though?

3832
04:26:29,470 --> 04:26:29,990
That's him.

3833
04:26:41,990 --> 04:26:44,650
There was no saving that.

3834
04:26:51,790 --> 04:26:54,990
Oh, I saw people dead.

3835
04:26:55,870 --> 04:26:57,790
I don't think it's yay anymore.

3836
04:27:01,470 --> 04:27:03,000
Guys, it's not yay anymore.

3837
04:27:03,520 --> 04:27:06,420
Guys, the yays is over.

3838
04:27:07,140 --> 04:27:08,300
It's no more yays.

3839
04:27:08,480 --> 04:27:10,440
No more yays!

3840
04:27:13,560 --> 04:27:14,840
I'm at diamond!

3841
04:27:15,460 --> 04:27:16,520
I'm diamond three!

3842
04:27:17,200 --> 04:27:20,220
But, three more wins, diamond three.

3843
04:27:22,760 --> 04:27:28,580
I swear, I'll be chasing this top 500 high for like the next...

3844
04:27:28,580 --> 04:27:29,740
I swear, I'm going to do another stream.

3845
04:27:30,260 --> 04:27:31,680
Oh my god, I swear to god.

3846
04:27:32,040 --> 04:27:35,620
And I get to touch grandmaster before I get to top 500.

3847
04:27:35,760 --> 04:27:36,600
I swear to god.

3848
04:27:37,200 --> 04:27:39,240
I'm always like this close.

3849
04:27:45,690 --> 04:27:46,610
It's okay, it's fine.

3850
04:27:49,730 --> 04:27:50,390
It's fine.

3851
04:27:53,490 --> 04:27:54,650
It's fine.

3852
04:27:56,490 --> 04:28:00,830
I don't know where the squirrels are, but I assume everything is fine.

3853
04:28:04,350 --> 04:28:06,930
I'm dodging as many things as possible.

3854
04:28:15,600 --> 04:28:17,160
Oh my god, did he get it?

3855
04:28:17,520 --> 04:28:18,140
Did he get it?

3856
04:28:18,280 --> 04:28:19,420
I don't know if he did.

3857
04:28:24,970 --> 04:28:29,710
If you want heals, you gotta come down here.

3858
04:28:39,850 --> 04:28:41,090
Oh my god, he's so low!

3859
04:28:41,930 --> 04:28:42,630
Oh, no!

3860
04:28:42,810 --> 04:28:43,210
No!

3861
04:28:47,470 --> 04:28:48,110
Oh my god.

3862
04:28:51,570 --> 04:28:52,750
Okay, nice.

3863
04:28:54,810 --> 04:28:56,290
Holy shit.

3864
04:28:58,690 --> 04:29:00,090
Oh my god.

3865
04:29:01,590 --> 04:29:03,190
We're all trying so hard.

3866
04:29:03,870 --> 04:29:06,230
We're all trying so hard.

3867
04:29:08,550 --> 04:29:10,410
If I can't go, my god.

3868
04:29:12,450 --> 04:29:15,170
Bro, shut the fuck up, Gatsby.

3869
04:29:16,170 --> 04:29:18,510
Touch some fucking grass.

3870
04:29:21,830 --> 04:29:24,370
Gatsby, touch some grass.

3871
04:29:32,110 --> 04:29:34,110
He's just Gatsby.

3872
04:29:40,520 --> 04:29:42,780
Lock the fuck in.

3873
04:29:44,120 --> 04:29:46,800
How the fuck do you remember that?

3874
04:29:47,620 --> 04:29:51,900
Like, how do you remember the exact—what's wrong with you?

3875
04:29:55,420 --> 04:29:56,960
What's wrong with you?

3876
04:29:56,960 --> 04:29:58,800
How do you remember the exact...

3877
04:30:05,500 --> 04:30:07,520
Actually, are you okay?

3878
04:30:10,460 --> 04:30:13,660
Like, exact number of damage...

3879
04:30:17,140 --> 04:30:18,800
What happened there?

3880
04:30:21,940 --> 04:30:22,340
Again!

3881
04:30:26,340 --> 04:30:26,740
Again!

3882
04:30:30,540 --> 04:30:31,820
Yeah, I'm capping for us.

3883
04:30:31,900 --> 04:30:32,300
Don't worry.

3884
04:30:32,500 --> 04:30:33,880
You don't have to worry about me, I guess.

3885
04:30:35,440 --> 04:30:37,180
They just want to think about how I'm doing.

3886
04:30:40,300 --> 04:30:41,460
I like ban system.

3887
04:30:41,600 --> 04:30:42,660
I'm glad they added a ban.

3888
04:30:44,520 --> 04:30:57,560
But then that means those who learn Hawkeye and the people that learn Hawkeye and Hela, there's no— It's actually, like, sucks to be them, I guess.

3889
04:31:03,700 --> 04:31:07,320
Oh my—guys, guys, there's like 20 people behind us.

3890
04:31:07,620 --> 04:31:09,760
Because I think, like, Hawkeye is insta-bad.

3891
04:31:11,140 --> 04:31:11,820
That's what I'm saying.

3892
04:31:11,920 --> 04:31:13,040
Why waste it on a support?

3893
04:31:13,420 --> 04:31:14,540
I can one-trick all I want.

3894
04:31:18,730 --> 04:31:19,830
That's the best part.

3895
04:31:24,160 --> 04:31:25,060
That's the best part.

3896
04:31:25,220 --> 04:31:26,400
They're enabling me.

3897
04:31:30,840 --> 04:31:31,280
Oh.

3898
04:31:31,280 --> 04:31:32,040
Okay, goodbye.

3899
04:31:37,880 --> 04:31:39,540
Alright, yeah, there's no saving that.

3900
04:31:43,920 --> 04:31:44,980
I'm getting away from you guys.

3901
04:31:45,100 --> 04:31:45,560
I don't wanna get hit.

3902
04:31:48,460 --> 04:31:50,660
This is a really tight game, though.

3903
04:32:01,860 --> 04:32:03,720
Alright, we push.

3904
04:32:04,200 --> 04:32:06,500
Alright, we don't push that side.

3905
04:32:06,640 --> 04:32:08,700
We go to the right side.

3906
04:32:09,860 --> 04:32:15,560
Oh my god, I—honestly, what's the game plan there?

3907
04:32:24,590 --> 04:32:27,010
Alright, they said winnable.

3908
04:32:27,670 --> 04:32:28,750
We have DPS.

3909
04:32:31,070 --> 04:32:34,750
We better kill the Psylocke, because we know what's gonna happen.

3910
04:32:38,840 --> 04:32:41,760
We should really kill the Psylocke.

3911
04:32:41,860 --> 04:32:43,940
Oh, got it.

3912
04:32:58,190 --> 04:32:58,870
Yeah.

3913
04:33:00,650 --> 04:33:01,210
Yeah.

3914
04:33:01,210 --> 04:33:01,410
Yeah.

3915
04:33:06,140 --> 04:33:13,020
I knew the moment—you know, the moment I used that ult, I was like, oh shit, wait, that was sick.

3916
04:33:20,720 --> 04:33:24,260
Guys, I need you guys to stop grouping together so you won't die.

3917
04:33:28,440 --> 04:33:29,540
Wouldn't that be cool?

3918
04:33:35,850 --> 04:33:36,850
Are you alive?

3919
04:33:37,430 --> 04:33:38,030
You are.

3920
04:33:38,350 --> 04:33:38,870
Okay.

3921
04:33:40,290 --> 04:33:41,230
He lives.

3922
04:33:41,710 --> 04:33:45,110
Oh my god, he does not live no more.

3923
04:33:48,110 --> 04:33:50,270
Oh, that's—that's a lot of damage.

3924
04:33:51,190 --> 04:33:55,450
It's just you and I support, and also you, I guess.

3925
04:33:56,710 --> 04:33:58,150
Guys, we have to kill that.

3926
04:33:58,690 --> 04:33:59,090
We—

3927
04:34:04,510 --> 04:34:05,670
Oh my god.

3928
04:34:08,700 --> 04:34:09,060
Okay.

3929
04:34:10,900 --> 04:34:13,300
Before we kill, we gotta avoid it.

3930
04:34:13,360 --> 04:34:16,620
Okay, who—okay, who's avoiding him?

3931
04:34:35,160 --> 04:34:36,320
Four more games.

3932
04:34:37,600 --> 04:34:39,540
Four more games.

3933
04:34:41,160 --> 04:34:41,760
Guys.

3934
04:34:42,300 --> 04:34:44,800
Hey, we broke the four—three game thing.

3935
04:34:46,460 --> 04:34:47,060
Okay.

3936
04:34:47,740 --> 04:34:49,700
I swear to god, they better have avoided him.

3937
04:34:50,140 --> 04:34:53,080
I swear to god, we—that was such—so fast.

3938
04:34:53,540 --> 04:34:56,000
If I see fucking—oh, he's not there.

3939
04:34:56,200 --> 04:35:01,660
Okay, I was gonna say, if I see Gatsby there again, I swear to fucking god.

3940
04:35:04,160 --> 04:35:06,920
Oh my god.

3941
04:35:07,480 --> 04:35:07,480
Oh my god.

3942
04:35:07,480 --> 04:35:08,040
Four more games.

3943
04:35:09,160 --> 04:35:09,880
Four more games.

3944
04:35:14,080 --> 04:35:14,960
Oh, thank god.

3945
04:35:15,600 --> 04:35:17,120
Thank fucking god.

3946
04:35:17,560 --> 04:35:19,580
We get to finally have him on the other side.

3947
04:35:20,140 --> 04:35:21,320
I'm so happy.

3948
04:35:26,380 --> 04:35:30,440
Oh shit, someone is—someone's not—Diamond!

3949
04:35:30,840 --> 04:35:31,600
Who could it be?

3950
04:35:34,380 --> 04:35:35,420
Water real quick, guys.

3951
04:35:35,560 --> 04:35:36,600
I'll be right back.

3952
04:36:13,960 --> 04:36:16,400
Alright, here we go.

3953
04:36:18,960 --> 04:36:20,360
Alright, two supports.

3954
04:36:20,600 --> 04:36:22,660
We have—oh my god, I've never seen two tanks before.

3955
04:36:23,140 --> 04:36:27,760
I feel like it's been 20 years since I saw two tanks.

3956
04:36:27,860 --> 04:36:28,780
It's actually crazy.

3957
04:36:29,360 --> 04:36:31,080
They actually exist in this world.

3958
04:36:33,740 --> 04:36:35,460
They're actually real.

3959
04:36:35,900 --> 04:36:37,560
Who the fuck would've thought?

3960
04:36:38,340 --> 04:36:39,940
They actually exist?

3961
04:36:40,280 --> 04:36:41,540
Two separate tanks?

3962
04:36:46,190 --> 04:36:49,990
Is it crazy, like, today I bumped into zero Luna mains?

3963
04:36:50,330 --> 04:36:52,510
What the fuck happened last night?

3964
04:37:01,080 --> 04:37:02,740
Guys, I don't know about this.

3965
04:37:16,820 --> 04:37:17,500
Oh.

3966
04:37:18,860 --> 04:37:19,500
I have to reload.

3967
04:37:22,480 --> 04:37:23,980
Oh my god.

3968
04:37:26,180 --> 04:37:27,740
What the fuck happened?

3969
04:37:35,040 --> 04:37:36,980
We got two fucking kills.

3970
04:37:45,160 --> 04:37:46,680
Oh my god, what happened?

3971
04:37:50,790 --> 04:37:52,050
It's fine, that's fine.

3972
04:37:52,710 --> 04:37:53,990
I'm gonna put in one of the tanks for now.

3973
04:37:55,030 --> 04:38:02,530
Because we have two, like, flankers—like, two tanks that are—we have the Captain America that's more so, like, he's going in.

3974
04:38:02,650 --> 04:38:02,930
Yeah.

3975
04:38:03,310 --> 04:38:04,110
See, there he is.

3976
04:38:04,390 --> 04:38:05,830
He's going fucking in.

3977
04:38:11,380 --> 04:38:12,640
He's going in, in.

3978
04:38:13,220 --> 04:38:15,500
Jesus Christ, he's going so in.

3979
04:38:16,440 --> 04:38:17,860
He's still going in.

3980
04:38:23,340 --> 04:38:26,600
He's still—oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, dancing in the circle!

3981
04:38:29,720 --> 04:38:31,560
Alright, that's fine.

3982
04:38:41,740 --> 04:38:43,980
Oh my god, the stupid tree!

3983
04:38:48,570 --> 04:38:49,250
It's fine.

3984
04:38:53,530 --> 04:38:55,850
Oh my god, she's—she's her!

3985
04:38:56,230 --> 04:38:56,890
She's him!

3986
04:39:03,750 --> 04:39:04,310
Oh my god.

3987
04:39:04,310 --> 04:39:05,090
Okay, that's fine.

3988
04:39:06,210 --> 04:39:07,830
I'm on the Panther now.

3989
04:39:09,670 --> 04:39:10,270
Their group!

3990
04:39:14,130 --> 04:39:17,430
Yeah, I think me putting it on the Captain America was a good idea.

3991
04:39:21,240 --> 04:39:24,620
Because he has not yet died, which is crazy.

3992
04:39:26,920 --> 04:39:29,620
I honestly did not expect him to live that long.

3993
04:39:31,320 --> 04:39:32,880
And now he might die.

3994
04:39:38,940 --> 04:39:45,720
Because, like, the Penny Parker is the one that's tanking everything, so me healing Penny is healing Cap—uh, Captain America.

3995
04:39:46,220 --> 04:39:47,620
So it's beneficial.

3996
04:39:50,140 --> 04:39:51,500
What if I stay behind there?

3997
04:39:51,940 --> 04:39:52,900
He can never hit me.

3998
04:39:56,100 --> 04:39:57,620
There's no way he gets in here.

3999
04:39:59,440 --> 04:40:00,020
Woo!

4000
04:40:06,480 --> 04:40:08,340
My god, you're so silly!

4001
04:40:12,860 --> 04:40:14,280
I can't believe he ran.

4002
04:40:25,720 --> 04:40:27,140
Is he still alive?

4003
04:40:27,480 --> 04:40:28,780
He's still alive?!

4004
04:40:29,600 --> 04:40:32,350
Look at all that!

4005
04:40:37,670 --> 04:40:40,370
My god, he actually lived?!

4006
04:40:43,980 --> 04:40:47,280
Oh my god, I'm gonna get my nether—nether ult again at this rate.

4007
04:40:51,700 --> 04:40:52,500
Please, guys.

4008
04:40:53,040 --> 04:40:53,560
One kill!

4009
04:40:53,820 --> 04:40:56,480
There we go, it's not that difficult to get one kill, guys!

4010
04:40:58,580 --> 04:41:03,300
Oh, okay, I—okay, you—oh, okay, I'll go DP—oh, okay, I'll go attack, I'll go heal.

4011
04:41:08,110 --> 04:41:09,850
So, who's gonna be who?

4012
04:41:10,290 --> 04:41:17,290
I like how we couldn't—we couldn't figure out who wants to be healed and who wants to be attacked.

4013
04:41:17,290 --> 04:41:19,290
Wait, what?!

4014
04:41:22,290 --> 04:41:27,310
I was like, yeah—I can't—you heal?

4015
04:41:27,510 --> 04:41:28,230
I heal?

4016
04:41:28,350 --> 04:41:30,350
Oh, we both heal, okay.

4017
04:41:34,630 --> 04:41:37,370
It's very difficult to figure it out.

4018
04:41:37,950 --> 04:41:39,330
I couldn't tell.

4019
04:41:39,830 --> 04:41:41,290
We're just too busy dancing.

4020
04:41:43,530 --> 04:41:44,670
We're just dancing.

4021
04:41:50,820 --> 04:41:52,440
Oh, we just kept dancing.

4022
04:41:55,700 --> 04:41:59,300
And then I'm just gonna... oh, he's... oh, ho, ho, ho.

4023
04:42:00,380 --> 04:42:02,220
That was me last time.

4024
04:42:08,480 --> 04:42:09,000
Nice.

4025
04:42:11,320 --> 04:42:12,520
Goodbye, Captain America.

4026
04:42:13,120 --> 04:42:14,160
Hello, Captain America.

4027
04:42:16,380 --> 04:42:17,660
Goodbye, Captain America.

4028
04:42:21,520 --> 04:42:24,080
Oh, goodbye forever, Captain America?

4029
04:42:32,290 --> 04:42:34,150
Oh my god, please.

4030
04:42:36,670 --> 04:42:38,770
He's so... he's half, he's half.

4031
04:42:43,750 --> 04:42:44,270
Okay, nice.

4032
04:42:44,370 --> 04:42:44,770
We'll play here.

4033
04:42:47,770 --> 04:42:50,110
Oh no, Benny, no!

4034
04:42:54,950 --> 04:42:55,590
Please!

4035
04:42:56,590 --> 04:42:58,470
Why are we still here?

4036
04:43:01,310 --> 04:43:02,510
Please get over here.

4037
04:43:03,470 --> 04:43:05,910
I'm here to dance!

4038
04:43:07,570 --> 04:43:08,790
Get the trio!

4039
04:43:09,090 --> 04:43:09,370
No!

4040
04:43:11,550 --> 04:43:13,710
He couldn't dance!

4041
04:43:18,290 --> 04:43:19,110
Poor guy.

4042
04:43:20,150 --> 04:43:21,370
He couldn't dance.

4043
04:43:29,320 --> 04:43:30,640
Whiskey, please look at me.

4044
04:43:31,220 --> 04:43:31,920
Whiskey, please.

4045
04:43:32,720 --> 04:43:33,720
Please, I'm like right here.

4046
04:43:34,040 --> 04:43:34,860
Thank you.

4047
04:43:43,080 --> 04:43:47,440
Oh my god.

4048
04:43:47,880 --> 04:43:48,400
No!

4049
04:43:49,500 --> 04:43:50,320
Oh, he can fly.

4050
04:43:51,780 --> 04:43:52,840
Could he sing too?

4051
04:44:00,640 --> 04:44:02,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

4052
04:44:02,900 --> 04:44:04,740
There's too much.

4053
04:44:05,400 --> 04:44:06,040
Oh

4054
04:44:13,360 --> 04:44:14,380
my god, please!

4055
04:44:15,120 --> 04:44:18,040
This fight is never ending!

4056
04:44:28,100 --> 04:44:31,320
I have ult, but I wait.

4057
04:44:33,580 --> 04:44:34,940
Okay, we got Groot.

4058
04:44:36,020 --> 04:44:37,160
We have both support ults.

4059
04:44:40,520 --> 04:44:42,280
Oh my god, and he came in through a portal!

4060
04:44:43,280 --> 04:44:45,680
Guys, four more games.

4061
04:44:46,800 --> 04:44:49,340
Guys, four more games.

4062
04:45:04,400 --> 04:45:05,340
We need two!

4063
04:45:06,720 --> 04:45:08,680
I am two!

4064
04:45:10,140 --> 04:45:10,780
Yes!

4065
04:45:12,760 --> 04:45:16,560
Oh, not yes!

4066
04:45:16,560 --> 04:45:17,160
Yes!

4067
04:45:17,340 --> 04:45:20,140
Not yes anymore!

4068
04:45:21,040 --> 04:45:22,500
Not yes!

4069
04:45:28,040 --> 04:45:29,100
Oh,

4070
04:45:34,860 --> 04:45:38,680
did SK also ulted?

4071
04:45:42,560 --> 04:45:44,880
Oh my god, I didn't realize she ulted too.

4072
04:45:48,560 --> 04:45:49,780
I didn't realize.

4073
04:45:49,980 --> 04:45:51,480
Bro, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

4074
04:45:52,040 --> 04:45:54,960
Bro, thank god he doesn't know VTuber exists.

4075
04:45:55,520 --> 04:45:56,600
Thank fucking god, bro.

4076
04:45:56,660 --> 04:45:57,440
Fuck that guy.

4077
04:46:02,040 --> 04:46:04,100
That actually kept ulting of SK?

4078
04:46:05,820 --> 04:46:07,660
I thought that was the enemy Luna.

4079
04:46:07,960 --> 04:46:10,180
I didn't realize it was SK that ulted.

4080
04:46:12,320 --> 04:46:14,080
Man, he's a fucking weirdo.

4081
04:46:14,900 --> 04:46:16,700
Bro, he really needs to touch grass.

4082
04:46:19,560 --> 04:46:23,200
He really needs to- Bro, what the fuck is wrong with you, bro?

4083
04:46:35,380 --> 04:46:35,860
Actually?

4084
04:46:39,140 --> 04:46:40,800
Bro, what's wrong with him?

4085
04:46:42,260 --> 04:46:42,960
Bro, I don't know.

4086
04:46:43,100 --> 04:46:43,920
What does he do?

4087
04:46:58,650 --> 04:47:00,590
Bro, is he okay?

4088
04:47:01,770 --> 04:47:04,730
I don't think he knows- He has social contacts.

4089
04:47:08,430 --> 04:47:19,570
I don't think- I don't- I don't think- I don't think he knows that he was like condescending with that.

4090
04:47:29,180 --> 04:47:29,900
Okay.

4091
04:47:35,250 --> 04:47:35,650
Goodbye.

4092
04:47:38,530 --> 04:47:41,370
Let him live in- Never meet your heroes.

4093
04:47:42,050 --> 04:47:44,770
You don't know if we're shit-talking you if you bump into us in rank.

4094
04:47:49,170 --> 04:47:49,810
That's right.

4095
04:47:50,310 --> 04:47:50,890
That's right.

4096
04:47:50,990 --> 04:47:52,090
If you were in my lobby...

4097
04:47:53,230 --> 04:47:56,270
You know damn well...

4098
04:47:56,270 --> 04:47:58,350
I was not a good person to you.

4099
04:48:05,320 --> 04:48:05,820
True.

4100
04:48:07,930 --> 04:48:09,240
Never meet your heroes.

4101
04:48:15,890 --> 04:48:16,790
Exactly.

4102
04:48:17,870 --> 04:48:19,910
I should talk every- Exactly.

4103
04:48:20,110 --> 04:48:21,930
I should talk every random.

4104
04:48:23,730 --> 04:48:25,050
That's right.

4105
04:48:28,900 --> 04:48:29,910
Oh, thank you.

4106
04:48:30,490 --> 04:48:32,090
I got the little peek-a-pews.

4107
04:48:35,670 --> 04:48:36,710
Oh my god.

4108
04:48:36,850 --> 04:48:37,370
Again!

4109
04:48:42,250 --> 04:48:43,370
You should know better.

4110
04:48:44,250 --> 04:48:46,730
You should know better.

4111
04:48:47,590 --> 04:48:49,570
Whenever I said a nice thing about randoms.

4112
04:48:53,590 --> 04:48:55,290
You should know by now.

4113
04:48:58,370 --> 04:48:59,130
Again!

4114
04:49:20,050 --> 04:49:21,090
I'm scared.

4115
04:49:21,970 --> 04:49:23,170
Don't look at me.

4116
04:49:26,680 --> 04:49:27,920
Don't look at me.

4117
04:49:28,260 --> 04:49:28,780
I'm scared.

4118
04:49:29,100 --> 04:49:29,780
Don't look at me.

4119
04:49:32,100 --> 04:49:32,540
Okay.

4120
04:49:33,400 --> 04:49:33,840
Nice.

4121
04:49:36,960 --> 04:49:41,400
If we win this, we're back to three- We're back to the three game phase.

4122
04:49:42,440 --> 04:49:44,080
I like to do that as my shortcut.

4123
04:49:45,180 --> 04:49:47,660
Cause I know you can do the stairs, but this is faster.

4124
04:49:48,680 --> 04:49:50,680
But it's also like...

4125
04:49:52,060 --> 04:49:53,160
Not efficient.

4126
04:50:12,230 --> 04:50:12,870
Oh,

4127
04:50:19,460 --> 04:50:21,400
this is bad.

4128
04:50:22,260 --> 04:50:23,400
Where's my cover?

4129
04:50:27,040 --> 04:50:28,320
Guys, this is bad.

4130
04:50:30,140 --> 04:50:31,320
This is bad.

4131
04:50:31,400 --> 04:50:32,740
We were all gonna die anyway.

4132
04:50:36,300 --> 04:50:37,380
Three to four.

4133
04:50:39,360 --> 04:50:41,340
I hope it's just three to four.

4134
04:50:42,800 --> 04:50:45,080
Bro, we had five ults, bro.

4135
04:50:50,420 --> 04:50:51,700
It's fucking crazy.

4136
04:50:58,660 --> 04:50:59,300
My...

4137
04:51:01,540 --> 04:51:03,160
Everything should be fine.

4138
04:51:04,220 --> 04:51:05,900
Everything should be fine.

4139
04:51:07,440 --> 04:51:09,100
Everything should be fine.

4140
04:51:13,080 --> 04:51:14,260
Wait, did it not work?

4141
04:51:18,360 --> 04:51:19,720
Jesus Christ!

4142
04:51:22,380 --> 04:51:23,040
Stand in a line!

4143
04:51:23,380 --> 04:51:24,280
Stand in a line!

4144
04:51:26,500 --> 04:51:28,600
Stand in a fucking line!

4145
04:51:36,800 --> 04:51:37,520
Line!

4146
04:51:47,540 --> 04:51:49,660
Oh, when I fucking jumped off.

4147
04:51:53,320 --> 04:51:55,700
He actually jumped off!

4148
04:51:59,720 --> 04:52:00,440
Oh,

4149
04:52:04,600 --> 04:52:04,980
it's bad.

4150
04:52:06,580 --> 04:52:09,480
I didn't want to use my ult, but...

4151
04:52:10,140 --> 04:52:11,160
It's bad.

4152
04:52:13,520 --> 04:52:14,040
It's bad.

4153
04:52:14,040 --> 04:52:16,080
I'm putting on the other tank, so it'll be easier to heal.

4154
04:52:18,840 --> 04:52:19,360
Yeah,

4155
04:52:24,090 --> 04:52:25,070
I'll use mine after then.

4156
04:52:28,690 --> 04:52:28,970
Okay.

4157
04:52:30,830 --> 04:52:32,210
I have to use this.

4158
04:52:37,880 --> 04:52:39,400
It's okay, guys!

4159
04:52:39,500 --> 04:52:40,220
It's okay!

4160
04:52:40,220 --> 04:52:40,240
It's okay!

4161
04:52:42,780 --> 04:52:44,740
Stand underneath this!

4162
04:52:45,100 --> 04:52:47,520
Don't stand underneath this!

4163
04:52:50,780 --> 04:52:51,660
Nevermind!

4164
04:52:52,040 --> 04:52:54,840
Do not stand underneath the bridge!

4165
04:52:58,960 --> 04:53:00,640
I realized the error.

4166
04:53:04,780 --> 04:53:07,980
Do not stand underneath the bridge, guys.

4167
04:53:07,980 --> 04:53:10,160
When you see an LL.

4168
04:53:15,040 --> 04:53:16,600
Oh, you're so low.

4169
04:53:18,360 --> 04:53:19,020
Can we get anybody?

4170
04:53:20,120 --> 04:53:21,260
Oh no, this is bad.

4171
04:53:31,190 --> 04:53:32,230
Oh, this is bad.

4172
04:53:32,730 --> 04:53:38,990
I cannot... I won't be able to get all... in this fight, so...

4173
04:53:38,990 --> 04:53:40,610
No way!

4174
04:53:48,810 --> 04:53:50,470
Guys, I don't... Yeah, I was gonna say, bro.

4175
04:53:50,550 --> 04:53:52,210
Yeah, that portal is not gonna hit.

4176
04:53:54,370 --> 04:53:55,870
Oh my god, Dr. Strange, please!

4177
04:53:56,270 --> 04:53:57,290
Live for us!

4178
04:53:58,430 --> 04:53:58,830
Live!

4179
04:54:00,810 --> 04:54:01,670
Oh, he lived.

4180
04:54:04,670 --> 04:54:05,350
Wait, why?

4181
04:54:06,310 --> 04:54:07,870
Oh, because she was close to ult.

4182
04:54:10,690 --> 04:54:11,950
I'm gonna put on the other tank.

4183
04:54:12,590 --> 04:54:13,250
It's just...

4184
04:54:13,910 --> 04:54:15,350
Our tank is taking too much damage.

4185
04:54:36,060 --> 04:54:37,340
Oh my god, I have to use it.

4186
04:54:38,940 --> 04:54:40,860
I have to use this, so...

4187
04:54:40,860 --> 04:54:43,420
So we can all live a little longer.

4188
04:54:53,760 --> 04:54:55,060
Oh my god.

4189
04:55:05,400 --> 04:55:06,800
I'm trying to see you.

4190
04:55:08,140 --> 04:55:09,000
Oh no, he's brooding.

4191
04:55:09,760 --> 04:55:11,020
Oh no, he's brooding!

4192
04:55:24,770 --> 04:55:25,990
But the touch is soon.

4193
04:55:32,200 --> 04:55:32,640
No!

4194
04:55:36,540 --> 04:55:38,460
I'm standing on a point, guys!

4195
04:55:38,600 --> 04:55:40,460
Someone else stand on it before I die!

4196
04:55:42,040 --> 04:55:42,560
No!

4197
04:55:54,970 --> 04:55:56,550
Oh my god.

4198
04:55:59,390 --> 04:56:03,930
Oh my god, I actually did 48k healing, too!

4199
04:56:05,630 --> 04:56:06,770
For the last...

4200
04:56:06,770 --> 04:56:07,830
Oh, look at me!

4201
04:56:08,410 --> 04:56:09,470
Oh my god!

4202
04:56:12,450 --> 04:56:13,630
Oh my god.

4203
04:56:14,890 --> 04:56:15,970
I kept...

4204
04:56:17,030 --> 04:56:17,750
Okay.

4205
04:56:24,230 --> 04:56:26,590
Oh my god.

4206
04:56:30,310 --> 04:56:32,810
Bro, that's actually paid!

4207
04:56:36,410 --> 04:56:37,290
How much healing?

4208
04:56:37,550 --> 04:56:38,590
Okay, I'll show you guys.

4209
04:56:42,320 --> 04:56:44,580
And my accuracy is higher, too.

4210
04:56:46,460 --> 04:56:48,280
And my accuracy...

4211
04:56:50,080 --> 04:56:51,480
That's so painful.

4212
04:56:52,520 --> 04:56:53,760
Oh my god.

4213
04:56:54,000 --> 04:56:56,460
I did so much heals.

4214
04:57:01,780 --> 04:57:03,560
Oh my god.

4215
04:57:04,420 --> 04:57:06,960
No, just four more games, guys!

4216
04:57:07,180 --> 04:57:07,580
Is it four?

4217
04:57:07,840 --> 04:57:09,060
3, 6, 7, 8, 9.

4218
04:57:09,260 --> 04:57:10,760
Yeah, it's four games.

4219
04:57:12,580 --> 04:57:14,400
Get me out of this hellhole.

4220
04:57:14,400 --> 04:57:15,540
Get me out.

4221
04:57:15,580 --> 04:57:16,760
Let me out.

4222
04:57:16,820 --> 04:57:17,840
Let me out.

4223
04:57:18,100 --> 04:57:19,690
Let me out.

4224
04:57:21,000 --> 04:57:22,400
They did more damage?

4225
04:57:22,580 --> 04:57:25,500
They had the opportunity to do more damage.

4226
04:57:26,110 --> 04:57:28,060
With the space that they had.

4227
04:57:28,500 --> 04:57:29,900
The space I had?

4228
04:57:30,540 --> 04:57:31,780
I had to just heal.

4229
04:57:34,230 --> 04:57:37,820
The tanks were just not okay.

4230
04:57:38,460 --> 04:57:39,520
They were...

4231
04:57:39,520 --> 04:57:41,380
They were not okay.

4232
04:57:41,380 --> 04:57:45,100
As in like, they were not healthy at all.

4233
04:57:45,340 --> 04:57:49,340
Every time I looked at them, they would be like, no HP.

4234
04:57:55,380 --> 04:57:57,620
And they'd just be like...

4235
04:57:57,620 --> 04:57:58,520
They'd just be like...

4236
04:58:04,840 --> 04:58:06,760
I'm Diamond 3 currently.

4237
04:58:08,140 --> 04:58:09,400
I'll pin it, too.

4238
04:58:09,860 --> 04:58:10,160
Okay.

4239
04:58:10,160 --> 04:58:11,160
Currently...

4240
04:58:11,920 --> 04:58:14,400
Currently at Diamond 3.

4241
04:58:15,100 --> 04:58:16,420
Top 500.

4242
04:58:17,720 --> 04:58:20,460
500 is high D3.

4243
04:58:21,020 --> 04:58:21,480
Okay.

4244
04:58:24,960 --> 04:58:27,600
Yeah, I had no time to not heal.

4245
04:58:27,740 --> 04:58:30,440
I just had to heal non-stop.

4246
04:58:31,320 --> 04:58:34,500
I had to heal non-stop until like, you know...

4247
04:58:34,800 --> 04:58:36,460
Until something happens.

4248
04:58:36,900 --> 04:58:39,060
Until something happens.

4249
04:58:39,060 --> 04:58:40,580
Holy shit.

4250
04:58:40,720 --> 04:58:41,680
Fucking hell.

4251
04:58:42,040 --> 04:58:43,460
Oh my god.

4252
04:58:43,720 --> 04:58:45,020
Oh my god.

4253
04:58:45,320 --> 04:58:45,880
No.

4254
04:58:47,040 --> 04:58:48,540
We had some good games.

4255
04:58:48,700 --> 04:58:49,380
This is the...

4256
04:58:49,380 --> 04:58:50,700
This is the curse Gatsby.

4257
04:58:50,840 --> 04:58:51,660
We had Gatsby.

4258
04:58:52,200 --> 04:58:52,760
Gatsby.

4259
04:58:53,120 --> 04:58:54,320
And avoided Gatsby.

4260
04:58:54,420 --> 04:58:55,480
And then he's not on DPS.

4261
04:58:55,900 --> 04:58:57,120
That's the worst part.

4262
04:58:57,700 --> 04:58:58,260
Gatsby...

4263
04:58:58,260 --> 04:58:59,180
Gatsby was on our team.

4264
04:58:59,440 --> 04:59:00,160
Took DPS.

4265
04:59:00,600 --> 04:59:01,720
Gatsby was on our team.

4266
04:59:02,000 --> 04:59:02,740
Took DPS.

4267
04:59:03,300 --> 04:59:05,200
Gatsby was on the enemy team.

4268
04:59:05,380 --> 04:59:07,340
He finally decided to play support.

4269
04:59:07,340 --> 04:59:10,700
He finally decided to fucking fail.

4270
04:59:14,820 --> 04:59:16,980
He actually was like, you know what?

4271
04:59:17,640 --> 04:59:20,980
I'm gonna fail this time and play support.

4272
04:59:21,440 --> 04:59:23,260
Instead of DPS.

4273
04:59:23,840 --> 04:59:24,160
Yeah.

4274
04:59:24,440 --> 04:59:26,260
We asked him to give us DPS.

4275
04:59:26,600 --> 04:59:27,780
And he's like, no.

4276
04:59:28,060 --> 04:59:29,980
So I think it's like wanted.

4277
04:59:31,860 --> 04:59:32,420
Or...

4278
04:59:33,020 --> 04:59:34,240
Wanted or SK.

4279
04:59:34,440 --> 04:59:35,280
I had to go support.

4280
04:59:37,340 --> 04:59:38,480
So yeah.

4281
04:59:41,380 --> 04:59:42,140
Oh.

4282
04:59:42,480 --> 04:59:42,820
Alright.

4283
04:59:43,720 --> 04:59:44,100
GG's.

4284
04:59:46,760 --> 04:59:48,800
Thanks for the game.

4285
04:59:50,280 --> 04:59:50,740
Okay.

4286
04:59:51,000 --> 04:59:51,540
Fucking...

4287
04:59:51,540 --> 04:59:52,420
We can do this.

4288
04:59:54,620 --> 04:59:55,020
We can...

4289
04:59:55,020 --> 04:59:55,400
We...

4290
04:59:55,400 --> 04:59:56,440
We could do this.

4291
04:59:58,500 --> 04:59:59,960
Oh my homie.

4292
05:00:00,280 --> 05:00:02,260
That's why he's fucking dead.

4293
05:00:02,720 --> 05:00:03,240
In his...

4294
05:00:05,340 --> 05:00:07,440
That's why he's dead.

4295
05:00:08,900 --> 05:00:09,760
Alright.

4296
05:00:11,480 --> 05:00:12,100
Four more games.

4297
05:00:12,800 --> 05:00:14,680
Four more games.

4298
05:00:15,240 --> 05:00:18,940
How are you always stuck in the fourth three?

4299
05:00:23,880 --> 05:00:25,460
Four to three.

4300
05:00:25,960 --> 05:00:28,000
It's always four to three.

4301
05:00:30,460 --> 05:00:31,300
How?

4302
05:00:32,340 --> 05:00:35,100
How are we stuck in this hellhole?

4303
05:00:35,840 --> 05:00:38,360
This is the worst purgatory.

4304
05:00:42,820 --> 05:00:46,080
I got to experience what it was like when it was...

4305
05:00:46,080 --> 05:00:46,760
I swear.

4306
05:00:47,020 --> 05:00:47,560
I swear.

4307
05:00:47,680 --> 05:00:48,080
I swear.

4308
05:00:48,220 --> 05:00:49,100
If I like...

4309
05:00:49,100 --> 05:00:49,700
Oh my god.

4310
05:00:50,620 --> 05:00:51,880
If I have to...

4311
05:00:51,880 --> 05:00:52,300
Oh my god.

4312
05:00:52,380 --> 05:00:53,660
If I have to...

4313
05:01:00,200 --> 05:01:01,000
I'm okay.

4314
05:01:01,740 --> 05:01:02,940
I'm so okay.

4315
05:01:03,560 --> 05:01:04,020
Oh shit.

4316
05:01:04,060 --> 05:01:04,840
It's KarQ.

4317
05:01:05,060 --> 05:01:05,400
Ready.

4318
05:01:09,320 --> 05:01:10,400
Oh my god.

4319
05:01:12,840 --> 05:01:13,420
Wait.

4320
05:01:13,800 --> 05:01:14,700
Oh, he's gold.

4321
05:01:16,800 --> 05:01:17,380
Wait.

4322
05:01:17,840 --> 05:01:18,320
Can you Q?

4323
05:01:19,360 --> 05:01:19,840
Can you...

4324
05:01:19,840 --> 05:01:20,200
Oh, bye.

4325
05:01:20,340 --> 05:01:20,460
Oh.

4326
05:01:23,420 --> 05:01:24,580
Goodbye KarQ.

4327
05:01:33,940 --> 05:01:35,360
Wait, is he not?

4328
05:01:35,580 --> 05:01:36,780
Oh, bring berries.

4329
05:01:37,540 --> 05:01:38,100
That's yellow.

4330
05:01:38,880 --> 05:01:40,200
That's gold one.

4331
05:01:47,620 --> 05:01:49,840
Guys, that's just yellow plat, guys.

4332
05:01:49,940 --> 05:01:51,800
Yeah, that's just yellow plat.

4333
05:01:57,040 --> 05:01:58,040
It's like...

4334
05:01:58,040 --> 05:02:01,300
It's basically platinum, but there's a visual bug, guys.

4335
05:02:02,040 --> 05:02:04,160
It's just a visual bug, chat.

4336
05:02:07,140 --> 05:02:10,960
I've seen him around in Overwatch days.

4337
05:02:13,240 --> 05:02:13,840
Never...

4338
05:02:13,840 --> 05:02:14,540
He was...

4339
05:02:14,540 --> 05:02:15,420
He's east though.

4340
05:02:15,420 --> 05:02:16,720
So...

4341
05:02:17,420 --> 05:02:19,640
So I never really got him...

4342
05:02:19,940 --> 05:02:21,460
Got him much.

4343
05:02:26,020 --> 05:02:28,040
Yeah, he's a fucking eastie.

4344
05:02:28,840 --> 05:02:29,520
So...

4345
05:02:29,520 --> 05:02:30,460
I never bump...

4346
05:02:30,460 --> 05:02:32,580
I rarely bump into east coast players.

4347
05:02:33,040 --> 05:02:35,460
Unless like...

4348
05:02:35,460 --> 05:02:37,220
Unless like I VPN.

4349
05:02:38,660 --> 05:02:42,200
Sometimes I VPN the east coast because at one time...

4350
05:02:42,200 --> 05:02:44,980
At one time, east coast lobbies were better.

4351
05:02:45,540 --> 05:02:46,880
And I would swap to...

4352
05:02:46,880 --> 05:02:49,080
Swap to east coast for Overwatch.

4353
05:02:50,120 --> 05:02:51,280
He's an eastie.

4354
05:02:52,940 --> 05:02:54,900
West coast, best coast, always.

4355
05:02:57,180 --> 05:02:58,520
Game Awards is tomorrow?

4356
05:02:58,840 --> 05:02:59,640
Wait, is it?

4357
05:03:00,120 --> 05:03:01,400
What time is it?

4358
05:03:02,960 --> 05:03:04,420
What time is the Game Awards?

4359
05:03:07,060 --> 05:03:08,020
Game Awards is just...

4360
05:03:08,020 --> 05:03:09,360
Yeah, you're damn right you are.

4361
05:03:12,710 --> 05:03:13,970
It's a full diamond.

4362
05:03:18,630 --> 05:03:19,530
I'm Luna Snow.

4363
05:03:19,890 --> 05:03:22,610
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

4364
05:03:25,030 --> 05:03:26,810
Oh, that's a cool icon.

4365
05:03:29,430 --> 05:03:30,490
Where is Rudy?

4366
05:03:35,910 --> 05:03:36,430
Hawkeye?

4367
05:03:36,930 --> 05:03:38,590
Do we have a strange player?

4368
05:03:39,570 --> 05:03:39,990
Yeah, Hawkeye.

4369
05:03:40,970 --> 05:03:42,150
Oh, I can play strings.

4370
05:03:42,290 --> 05:03:43,170
I'm not the best at it.

4371
05:03:43,270 --> 05:03:43,530
Hella?

4372
05:03:45,710 --> 05:03:46,730
Hella or Hawkeye?

4373
05:03:47,390 --> 05:03:47,770
Hawkeye.

4374
05:03:48,790 --> 05:03:49,910
Let's go 50-50.

4375
05:03:50,130 --> 05:03:50,570
Whatever.

4376
05:03:51,270 --> 05:03:51,690
Alright.

4377
05:03:52,150 --> 05:03:52,330
Perfect.

4378
05:03:53,330 --> 05:03:53,570
Nice.

4379
05:03:53,570 --> 05:03:54,410
Do you guys want to ban Strange?

4380
05:03:54,950 --> 05:03:55,690
Or do we want to play?

4381
05:03:56,750 --> 05:03:58,310
We can... I say we ban him.

4382
05:03:59,770 --> 05:04:00,970
We ban Strange?

4383
05:04:01,750 --> 05:04:02,870
That's how you can do it.

4384
05:04:02,970 --> 05:04:03,750
Yeah, fuck Strange.

4385
05:04:03,850 --> 05:04:04,650
No portals today.

4386
05:04:05,330 --> 05:04:07,050
No fucking portals today.

4387
05:04:22,960 --> 05:04:23,440
Alright.

4388
05:04:25,980 --> 05:04:27,840
No Psylocke for you guys.

4389
05:04:30,600 --> 05:04:31,640
Sorry, SK.

4390
05:04:32,400 --> 05:04:33,860
You gotta learn a new character.

4391
05:04:36,040 --> 05:04:37,040
Portals cancelling.

4392
05:04:37,200 --> 05:04:37,800
Cancel now.

4393
05:04:39,800 --> 05:04:40,700
We're in a timeline where...

4394
05:04:42,780 --> 05:04:45,320
Where Doctor Strange never became Doctor Strange.

4395
05:04:46,420 --> 05:04:48,300
He's still a successful plastic surgeon.

4396
05:04:52,080 --> 05:04:52,580
What are we gonna do?

4397
05:04:52,660 --> 05:04:53,600
Fucking ban Luna?

4398
05:04:53,740 --> 05:04:55,220
They're never gonna ban Luna, guys.

4399
05:04:55,320 --> 05:04:57,280
I can literally be enabled to be a one-trick.

4400
05:04:59,960 --> 05:05:01,680
They're never gonna ban her.

4401
05:05:02,360 --> 05:05:05,580
They don't want to waste a slot on a support.

4402
05:05:08,780 --> 05:05:09,420
Oh.

4403
05:05:10,420 --> 05:05:11,480
Star Lord.

4404
05:05:12,320 --> 05:05:13,220
Oh, sorry.

4405
05:05:13,320 --> 05:05:14,040
Heart Surgeon.

4406
05:05:14,540 --> 05:05:15,560
Oh my god, hey!

4407
05:05:15,700 --> 05:05:16,580
It's Spider-Man!

4408
05:05:19,300 --> 05:05:20,640
I almost got it correct.

4409
05:05:26,900 --> 05:05:31,320
I get like 50% of my Marvel lore correct.

4410
05:05:32,160 --> 05:05:33,780
Because I'm a DC girl.

4411
05:05:37,620 --> 05:05:42,400
I'm a DC girl so I only get like 50% of my Marvel lore correct.

4412
05:05:44,840 --> 05:05:47,680
I just know it was a surgeon of some kind.

4413
05:05:48,640 --> 05:05:53,420
I took a 50-50 guess because I know he like fucked up his hands from a car crash.

4414
05:05:56,260 --> 05:05:57,880
Because I never watch the movies.

4415
05:06:00,720 --> 05:06:01,920
Jesus Christ!

4416
05:06:09,330 --> 05:06:12,750
Guys, Thor is doing bad things right now.

4417
05:06:20,490 --> 05:06:21,090
Oh,

4418
05:06:30,630 --> 05:06:31,810
goodbye Fabi.

4419
05:06:34,650 --> 05:06:36,790
I thought that was the enemy right there.

4420
05:06:37,530 --> 05:06:40,510
Okay, I need to put this on the Venom.

4421
05:06:46,220 --> 05:06:48,020
Wait, how did we lose our guy?

4422
05:06:50,180 --> 05:06:50,840
Oh.

4423
05:06:51,080 --> 05:06:52,220
Okay, goodbye again.

4424
05:06:54,340 --> 05:06:56,020
He's so tired.

4425
05:06:59,130 --> 05:07:00,080
Oh no, guys.

4426
05:07:00,420 --> 05:07:02,080
I think I might derank.

4427
05:07:07,520 --> 05:07:08,180
Guys.

4428
05:07:08,880 --> 05:07:09,420
No.

4429
05:07:10,240 --> 05:07:10,900
No.

4430
05:07:12,280 --> 05:07:13,780
No, I just...

4431
05:07:13,780 --> 05:07:15,280
No.

4432
05:07:23,040 --> 05:07:24,380
No.

4433
05:07:32,510 --> 05:07:33,180
No.

4434
05:07:33,800 --> 05:07:35,550
Not like this.

4435
05:07:36,650 --> 05:07:38,530
Not like this.

4436
05:07:39,300 --> 05:07:40,560
Oh my god.

4437
05:07:44,120 --> 05:07:44,880
I missed it.

4438
05:08:08,020 --> 05:08:09,300
Oh, I missed it.

4439
05:08:09,380 --> 05:08:10,920
I missed the freeze.

4440
05:08:11,460 --> 05:08:12,200
That's okay.

4441
05:08:14,800 --> 05:08:17,020
Just beat up Thor, please!

4442
05:08:18,420 --> 05:08:19,640
Kill the gun!

4443
05:08:24,250 --> 05:08:27,990
I thought we could hit in four hours.

4444
05:08:28,630 --> 05:08:29,870
I was fucking foolish.

4445
05:08:30,810 --> 05:08:31,990
I was a fool.

4446
05:08:32,930 --> 05:08:34,270
For believing in...

4447
05:08:34,270 --> 05:08:35,650
Guys.

4448
05:08:37,090 --> 05:08:39,590
If we don't do it in six hours...

4449
05:08:40,250 --> 05:08:42,110
We're Marvel rivaling again.

4450
05:08:48,730 --> 05:08:54,120
There is a possibility...

4451
05:08:59,060 --> 05:09:03,180
That we're just gonna keep Marvel rivaling.

4452
05:09:04,740 --> 05:09:07,620
It's getting closer to God of War, guys.

4453
05:09:09,000 --> 05:09:10,540
It's getting closer.

4454
05:09:20,440 --> 05:09:21,120
Oh,

4455
05:09:26,820 --> 05:09:27,080
what?

4456
05:09:27,240 --> 05:09:27,880
I ulted.

4457
05:09:33,680 --> 05:09:34,880
Guys, I think...

4458
05:09:36,060 --> 05:09:37,900
I don't know, guys.

4459
05:09:38,160 --> 05:09:38,500
Yeah.

4460
05:09:44,820 --> 05:09:46,980
The announcement...

4461
05:09:46,980 --> 05:09:50,140
I'm playing more Marvel right now.

4462
05:09:54,140 --> 05:09:55,220
Guys,

4463
05:09:59,920 --> 05:10:00,180
why?

4464
05:10:02,080 --> 05:10:03,660
Why didn't you just went in?

4465
05:10:06,020 --> 05:10:07,760
Guys, you're in Diamond!

4466
05:10:20,720 --> 05:10:22,380
Please, please.

4467
05:10:24,220 --> 05:10:24,980
Watch out!

4468
05:10:28,070 --> 05:10:29,250
Oh, no!

4469
05:10:36,160 --> 05:10:38,140
No, I got fucking caught!

4470
05:10:42,960 --> 05:10:43,760
No!

4471
05:10:45,180 --> 05:10:46,540
I need farming going!

4472
05:10:49,330 --> 05:10:50,210
Oh, my God.

4473
05:10:50,230 --> 05:10:51,350
He's so dumb.

4474
05:10:54,330 --> 05:10:55,850
Oh, my God.

4475
05:10:55,970 --> 05:10:57,870
Why did he not go in?

4476
05:11:00,270 --> 05:11:01,850
Oh, my God.

4477
05:11:02,450 --> 05:11:03,250
Bro!

4478
05:11:06,330 --> 05:11:06,850
No!

4479
05:11:07,090 --> 05:11:07,930
I don't know.

4480
05:11:08,030 --> 05:11:09,910
You're not fucking going in.

4481
05:11:12,450 --> 05:11:15,370
I think the issue was that we were all on...

4482
05:11:15,370 --> 05:11:19,250
They were on high ground, but both supports were on low ground.

4483
05:11:19,530 --> 05:11:21,730
That was a problem.

4484
05:11:25,430 --> 05:11:26,410
Oh, my God.

4485
05:11:26,910 --> 05:11:29,250
Guys, all I'm saying...

4486
05:11:29,250 --> 05:11:30,290
If you curse me more...

4487
05:11:31,110 --> 05:11:32,530
If you curse me more...

4488
05:11:33,250 --> 05:11:36,090
Streams will continue to become Marvel Rivals.

4489
05:11:39,510 --> 05:11:40,670
Oh,

4490
05:11:46,450 --> 05:11:46,690
no.

4491
05:11:47,330 --> 05:11:51,290
I can't derink.

4492
05:11:51,410 --> 05:11:52,090
No!

4493
05:11:53,170 --> 05:11:54,010
No!

4494
05:12:14,830 --> 05:12:17,030
I'm going to add my own BGM at this point.

4495
05:12:29,490 --> 05:12:29,970
No!

4496
05:12:46,710 --> 05:12:48,990
He broke the fucking...

4497
05:12:53,510 --> 05:12:54,510
Oh, my God.

4498
05:12:54,790 --> 05:12:56,030
I used three ults there.

4499
05:13:03,960 --> 05:13:04,880
It's fine.

4500
05:13:05,120 --> 05:13:05,740
We're fine.

4501
05:13:06,840 --> 05:13:09,020
Where do you hear this clown music, Dookie?

4502
05:13:09,620 --> 05:13:10,220
What do you mean?

4503
05:13:10,260 --> 05:13:11,760
Don't you guys hear the music too?

4504
05:13:14,220 --> 05:13:15,760
Don't you guys hear that music?

4505
05:13:16,440 --> 05:13:17,740
Do you not hear it playing?

4506
05:13:41,940 --> 05:13:42,720
Please.

4507
05:13:43,000 --> 05:13:43,940
I don't want to...

4508
05:13:43,940 --> 05:13:44,320
Please.

4509
05:13:45,400 --> 05:13:49,240
I don't want it to be spawning time!

4510
05:13:55,510 --> 05:13:55,900
No!

4511
05:13:58,980 --> 05:13:59,760
Alright.

4512
05:13:59,900 --> 05:14:00,300
That's fine.

4513
05:14:01,580 --> 05:14:02,180
That's fine.

4514
05:14:07,970 --> 05:14:11,100
That's my least favourite time of the year.

4515
05:14:15,840 --> 05:14:16,720
It's okay.

4516
05:14:17,680 --> 05:14:18,620
It's not okay.

4517
05:14:24,730 --> 05:14:25,830
It's fine.

4518
05:14:26,650 --> 05:14:27,970
We're so bad.

4519
05:14:34,500 --> 05:14:35,900
We're so bad.

4520
05:14:38,760 --> 05:14:39,740
That's right!

4521
05:14:40,340 --> 05:14:41,280
You and I!

4522
05:14:50,420 --> 05:14:51,780
Come on, get him!

4523
05:14:52,460 --> 05:14:53,000
That's fine.

4524
05:14:53,060 --> 05:14:53,560
We're fine.

4525
05:14:54,260 --> 05:14:58,180
My sanity is gone, but look at this cool number I've got.

4526
05:14:58,400 --> 05:14:59,500
I'm diamond three!

4527
05:15:00,720 --> 05:15:03,960
That's where all the high elo players are.

4528
05:15:06,120 --> 05:15:08,240
Dookie, that's not...

4529
05:15:08,240 --> 05:15:09,700
We should top 500.

4530
05:15:32,110 --> 05:15:34,270
We're stronger together!

4531
05:15:39,110 --> 05:15:47,930
Guys, we need to...

4532
05:15:47,950 --> 05:15:51,810
No, I had to look behind because I got...

4533
05:15:52,600 --> 05:15:54,450
They were like, we need healing.

4534
05:15:55,030 --> 05:15:57,350
So I was like, you do?

4535
05:15:57,950 --> 05:16:00,610
Let me look behind me.

4536
05:16:02,050 --> 05:16:02,790
No,

4537
05:16:08,710 --> 05:16:09,850
he was one!

4538
05:16:13,450 --> 05:16:15,450
Wait, where's my res?

4539
05:16:18,570 --> 05:16:19,850
Where's my res?

4540
05:16:21,490 --> 05:16:22,890
Where's my res?

4541
05:16:26,650 --> 05:16:28,250
Where's my res?

4542
05:16:28,930 --> 05:16:30,330
Where was it?

4543
05:16:32,170 --> 05:16:33,750
Where did it come from?

4544
05:16:33,870 --> 05:16:34,590
Where did it go?

4545
05:16:38,370 --> 05:16:39,370
Oh, you're right.

4546
05:16:39,590 --> 05:16:42,170
Okay, I have an idea what to play.

4547
05:16:42,730 --> 05:16:45,670
I think it'd be fabulous to have an all-superhero band.

4548
05:16:47,070 --> 05:16:49,190
Having an all-fabby band was a good idea.

4549
05:16:54,700 --> 05:16:57,900
I know what music to play after this game.

4550
05:16:58,800 --> 05:17:00,460
It doesn't matter win or loss.

4551
05:17:00,580 --> 05:17:05,120
I've been stuck at four to two games for so long.

4552
05:17:05,380 --> 05:17:07,160
I know exactly what to play.

4553
05:17:09,920 --> 05:17:14,260
I think like, honestly, I think if we have a tank player, it'd be easier.

4554
05:17:14,260 --> 05:17:16,600
I legit...

4555
05:17:16,600 --> 05:17:20,800
If we have a tank player, it would be a little easier.

4556
05:17:21,160 --> 05:17:22,240
I think.

4557
05:17:28,680 --> 05:17:29,360
Alright.

4558
05:17:31,240 --> 05:17:32,680
Here we go.

4559
05:17:42,420 --> 05:17:43,100
That's fine.

4560
05:17:44,220 --> 05:17:45,540
I'll have to heal as one of them.

4561
05:17:49,360 --> 05:17:50,320
Guys.

4562
05:17:51,880 --> 05:17:52,380
Guys.

4563
05:17:53,540 --> 05:17:58,040
You guys are taking a lot of damage and I'm scared.

4564
05:18:02,200 --> 05:18:07,960
You guys are taking way too much damage and I'm a little scared.

4565
05:18:16,110 --> 05:18:17,070
Okay.

4566
05:18:17,750 --> 05:18:18,110
No!

4567
05:18:18,750 --> 05:18:21,070
Fucking course that kills me!

4568
05:18:28,170 --> 05:18:29,670
Fucking course!

4569
05:18:33,910 --> 05:18:35,070
Oh my god.

4570
05:18:35,310 --> 05:18:35,890
Get the point.

4571
05:18:36,090 --> 05:18:37,210
Get the fucking point.

4572
05:18:43,670 --> 05:18:45,270
Who's still on it?

4573
05:18:47,330 --> 05:18:49,670
Who's a freak that's still on it?

4574
05:18:53,500 --> 05:18:54,520
You don't.

4575
05:18:57,960 --> 05:18:58,360
Okay.

4576
05:18:59,400 --> 05:18:59,800
Please.

4577
05:19:00,240 --> 05:19:00,600
Please.

4578
05:19:01,240 --> 05:19:01,620
I can't.

4579
05:19:02,420 --> 05:19:02,880
No!

4580
05:19:03,060 --> 05:19:04,640
I couldn't hit in time!

4581
05:19:05,960 --> 05:19:10,320
I got hit.

4582
05:19:14,420 --> 05:19:14,880
Oh.

4583
05:19:15,580 --> 05:19:16,980
Poor Magneto.

4584
05:19:17,720 --> 05:19:18,360
Oh.

4585
05:19:19,340 --> 05:19:20,460
Oh my god, Mercy res.

4586
05:19:26,380 --> 05:19:27,300
Okay.

4587
05:19:30,840 --> 05:19:33,820
I don't know if this will work.

4588
05:19:36,180 --> 05:19:37,180
But...

4589
05:19:43,220 --> 05:19:44,380
Guys.

4590
05:19:45,000 --> 05:19:46,000
No.

4591
05:19:46,520 --> 05:19:46,960
No!

4592
05:19:47,260 --> 05:19:49,500
He booped me off the health pack!

4593
05:19:50,760 --> 05:19:54,460
I almost got to the health pack too!

4594
05:19:58,180 --> 05:20:00,680
I actually almost got there!

4595
05:20:07,860 --> 05:20:09,320
That's so fucked.

4596
05:20:09,900 --> 05:20:11,140
That's actually so fucked.

4597
05:20:11,140 --> 05:20:11,340
Okay.

4598
05:20:16,680 --> 05:20:18,360
I think, like, we gotta reset.

4599
05:20:26,670 --> 05:20:28,050
Why are we going in one by one?

4600
05:20:29,310 --> 05:20:29,770
Stop!

4601
05:20:31,410 --> 05:20:31,870
Stop!

4602
05:20:36,490 --> 05:20:37,990
We have one last fight.

4603
05:20:40,330 --> 05:20:42,690
And I don't think I can...

4604
05:20:58,370 --> 05:20:59,370
No!

4605
05:21:01,510 --> 05:21:01,930
No!

4606
05:21:04,590 --> 05:21:05,590
Alright.

4607
05:21:06,910 --> 05:21:08,090
Oh my god.

4608
05:21:09,550 --> 05:21:10,510
Oh my god.

4609
05:21:10,790 --> 05:21:11,930
I do hate...

4610
05:21:14,230 --> 05:21:18,050
It's time to bring out the circus.

4611
05:21:22,910 --> 05:21:24,590
Alright, this is the song I...

4612
05:21:26,030 --> 05:21:27,090
This is the one.

4613
05:21:28,390 --> 05:21:28,830
Alright.

4614
05:21:29,090 --> 05:21:30,310
Wait, let me see if I...

4615
05:21:30,310 --> 05:21:32,030
Okay, this is the one I was thinking of.

4616
05:21:36,500 --> 05:21:37,020
Alright.

4617
05:21:38,840 --> 05:21:39,740
Oh my god.

4618
05:21:40,060 --> 05:21:40,800
This hurts.

4619
05:21:44,000 --> 05:21:46,420
Alright, is it this one?

4620
05:21:50,500 --> 05:21:51,560
Or is it?

4621
05:21:53,260 --> 05:21:54,840
Oh my god, where is it?

4622
05:21:57,960 --> 05:21:59,260
I need to find it.

4623
05:22:02,700 --> 05:22:03,640
Okay, wait, wait.

4624
05:22:06,160 --> 05:22:06,560
What's...

4625
05:22:06,560 --> 05:22:08,600
Okay, so you know how, like...

4626
05:22:08,600 --> 05:22:09,300
Okay, wait.

4627
05:22:09,780 --> 05:22:10,480
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4628
05:22:12,400 --> 05:22:13,420
I need to find it.

4629
05:22:13,440 --> 05:22:14,340
I need to find the...

4630
05:22:16,660 --> 05:22:19,260
I need to find the exact soundtrack.

4631
05:22:25,720 --> 05:22:26,940
No, that's creepy!

4632
05:22:27,240 --> 05:22:27,520
No!

4633
05:22:27,520 --> 05:22:28,720
What is it called?

4634
05:22:30,160 --> 05:22:31,720
What is it called?

4635
05:22:37,820 --> 05:22:38,860
Is it this?

4636
05:22:40,400 --> 05:22:40,720
Oh.

4637
05:22:41,240 --> 05:22:42,240
Wait, I think it's this.

4638
05:22:42,360 --> 05:22:42,800
Wait, okay.

4639
05:22:53,690 --> 05:22:54,710
Okay, okay.

4640
05:22:55,090 --> 05:22:55,690
Entrance.

4641
05:22:59,830 --> 05:23:01,470
Alright, I don't know if it sounds...

4642
05:23:02,210 --> 05:23:03,410
If it's like...

4643
05:23:03,410 --> 05:23:05,090
A little different or not.

4644
05:23:05,570 --> 05:23:07,390
Oh my god, nobody is like...

4645
05:23:07,390 --> 05:23:08,030
In yet.

4646
05:23:15,510 --> 05:23:17,490
Okay, this sounds sadder now.

4647
05:23:18,470 --> 05:23:20,870
This is a sad version...

4648
05:23:21,670 --> 05:23:22,330
Of...

4649
05:23:22,330 --> 05:23:23,830
It's slowed and...

4650
05:23:23,830 --> 05:23:25,650
This is a sad version of it.

4651
05:24:05,320 --> 05:24:06,800
Put it on the nose!

4652
05:24:07,420 --> 05:24:09,260
Put it on the nose!

4653
05:24:09,480 --> 05:24:11,960
Draver, put it on...

4654
05:24:11,960 --> 05:24:13,820
Put it on the nose!

4655
05:24:27,200 --> 05:24:32,900
Bum, bum, bum, bum, buuum...

4656
05:24:35,260 --> 05:24:38,520
Fly back in the circus we go!

4657
05:24:39,320 --> 05:24:41,140
We're back in the circus!

4658
05:24:43,520 --> 05:24:44,420
Yipeee!

4659
05:24:46,260 --> 05:24:48,820
We're in the circus now!

4660
05:24:50,300 --> 05:24:51,280
How the fuck?

4661
05:24:55,060 --> 05:24:56,440
How the fuck?

4662
05:24:56,540 --> 05:24:57,640
How did they all die?

4663
05:25:01,420 --> 05:25:02,960
Oh nice, he rooted.

4664
05:25:08,290 --> 05:25:09,190
Go Groot him!

4665
05:25:09,410 --> 05:25:10,330
Go Groot, Groot!

4666
05:25:20,960 --> 05:25:22,880
Guys, he Grooted too hard, guys.

4667
05:25:31,120 --> 05:25:31,900
It's fine.

4668
05:25:39,820 --> 05:25:43,060
I'm gonna put on the other tank, so we can have both tanks up.

4669
05:25:43,820 --> 05:25:44,960
So they'll never die.

4670
05:25:44,960 --> 05:25:47,960
A little pause...

4671
05:25:50,420 --> 05:25:51,260
Please look at me.

4672
05:25:51,560 --> 05:25:53,300
You're not gonna win that 1v1, you're bad.

4673
05:25:58,260 --> 05:25:59,640
Know your place.

4674
05:26:00,200 --> 05:26:01,820
Know your fucking place.

4675
05:26:01,820 --> 05:26:03,980
Be a good son.

4676
05:26:17,970 --> 05:26:19,250
Don't

4677
05:26:23,500 --> 05:26:25,840
worry, I'm here.

4678
05:26:41,340 --> 05:26:42,740
I didn't put on repeat.

4679
05:26:44,640 --> 05:26:47,880
We're in the game, I can't put it on repeat right now.

4680
05:26:50,160 --> 05:26:52,220
You're not important, Psylocke!

4681
05:26:52,680 --> 05:26:59,020
You couldn't even win a 1v1, you think I'm gonna let you just get healed over our fucking tanks?

4682
05:26:59,700 --> 05:27:00,860
Oh, you got killed, okay.

4683
05:27:01,460 --> 05:27:04,100
Okay, maybe it's okay.

4684
05:27:09,300 --> 05:27:10,120
Oh no.

4685
05:27:10,720 --> 05:27:11,500
Oh no, I'm in.

4686
05:27:11,800 --> 05:27:12,400
Oh no.

4687
05:27:13,100 --> 05:27:14,060
What's he gonna do?

4688
05:27:14,180 --> 05:27:15,620
Shoot me from here?

4689
05:27:18,400 --> 05:27:18,800
Okay.

4690
05:27:20,380 --> 05:27:21,380
It's fine.

4691
05:27:21,700 --> 05:27:22,140
Wait, did he?

4692
05:27:24,100 --> 05:27:25,060
That's fine.

4693
05:27:25,540 --> 05:27:26,140
See?

4694
05:27:26,580 --> 05:27:27,660
It's easy.

4695
05:27:29,340 --> 05:27:29,880
Look at that.

4696
05:27:31,060 --> 05:27:32,700
I picked wisely.

4697
05:27:34,700 --> 05:27:36,980
God, I'm so fucking good at Luna.

4698
05:27:40,430 --> 05:27:42,150
Oh my god, I'm so good.

4699
05:27:46,200 --> 05:27:48,020
They get healed, I win.

4700
05:27:52,500 --> 05:27:53,560
That's right, Groot.

4701
05:27:53,620 --> 05:27:54,260
Start Grooting!

4702
05:27:54,660 --> 05:27:55,880
Groot all over them!

4703
05:27:56,140 --> 05:27:58,140
And then I won't burn all your family down.

4704
05:28:00,060 --> 05:28:00,700
Okay.

4705
05:28:02,500 --> 05:28:03,140
Okay.

4706
05:28:04,140 --> 05:28:06,140
But not like that, Groot.

4707
05:28:06,680 --> 05:28:08,020
Okay, Groot.

4708
05:28:08,600 --> 05:28:09,220
Okay.

4709
05:28:09,220 --> 05:28:09,900
Okay.

4710
05:28:13,220 --> 05:28:17,740
I didn't realize there's an invisible wall there.

4711
05:28:18,040 --> 05:28:23,120
So that like, you can't, you have to jump to get past it.

4712
05:28:26,340 --> 05:28:27,420
Wait, are they also Groot?

4713
05:28:27,940 --> 05:28:28,880
Well, that's fucked.

4714
05:28:32,560 --> 05:28:34,240
How can you just start Grooting?

4715
05:28:38,850 --> 05:28:39,770
Oh, he's gonna Groot.

4716
05:28:42,980 --> 05:28:44,660
I froze somebody, I don't know who.

4717
05:28:45,540 --> 05:28:46,800
Oh no, he has no shield.

4718
05:28:48,540 --> 05:28:49,080
Alright, it's fine.

4719
05:28:51,980 --> 05:28:52,460
It's fine.

4720
05:28:53,040 --> 05:28:53,340
Please.

4721
05:28:55,780 --> 05:28:57,440
Oh god, I'm dancing.

4722
05:28:58,140 --> 05:28:59,660
I'm gonna dance!

4723
05:29:00,520 --> 05:29:04,180
I'm gonna dance so you all live!

4724
05:29:07,310 --> 05:29:07,870
No!

4725
05:29:10,430 --> 05:29:11,610
Oh thank god, okay.

4726
05:29:16,540 --> 05:29:17,660
Okay, it's Hella vs.

4727
05:29:17,740 --> 05:29:18,020
Hella.

4728
05:29:18,440 --> 05:29:18,960
Who wins?

4729
05:29:21,580 --> 05:29:22,580
Nice, we won.

4730
05:29:23,960 --> 05:29:24,480
Alright.

4731
05:29:25,280 --> 05:29:26,720
Alright, let me put this on repeat.

4732
05:29:28,100 --> 05:29:29,760
And then we can all enjoy it.

4733
05:29:30,100 --> 05:29:33,620
Wait, what's the word called when you make a song sad?

4734
05:29:34,400 --> 05:29:35,660
Make a song sad?

4735
05:29:35,720 --> 05:29:40,500
Like, you know how like, there's happy things, happy songs?

4736
05:29:40,880 --> 05:29:42,400
And, uh, minor!

4737
05:29:42,900 --> 05:29:44,580
Oh yeah, circus music and minor key.

4738
05:29:44,580 --> 05:29:46,380
Okay, let me see if I can find that.

4739
05:29:48,100 --> 05:29:50,980
Circus music and minor key.

4740
05:29:54,440 --> 05:29:55,660
Creepiest- is it this?

4741
05:29:56,960 --> 05:29:57,840
What does this sound like?

4742
05:30:11,640 --> 05:30:12,740
That's how I feel.

4743
05:30:18,950 --> 05:30:19,650
What?

4744
05:30:20,110 --> 05:30:24,070
I just said it's a madness.

4745
05:30:26,810 --> 05:30:28,130
Do you like the London seafood?

4746
05:30:28,470 --> 05:30:29,870
What year is it where you come from?

4747
05:30:30,330 --> 05:30:30,550
Four.

4748
05:30:35,230 --> 05:30:36,530
Bum bum bum.

4749
05:30:40,930 --> 05:30:42,010
Bum bum bum.

4750
05:30:46,130 --> 05:30:46,650
Four.

4751
05:30:47,610 --> 05:30:48,150
Three.

4752
05:30:48,690 --> 05:30:49,070
Two.

4753
05:30:49,570 --> 05:30:50,130
One.

4754
05:30:50,610 --> 05:30:52,750
This is where we live forever.

4755
05:30:56,450 --> 05:30:57,530
Anxiety.

4756
05:31:19,510 --> 05:31:20,490
Bum bum bum.

4757
05:31:20,610 --> 05:31:21,510
Bum bum bum.

4758
05:31:21,670 --> 05:31:22,330
Bum bum bum.

4759
05:31:24,470 --> 05:31:25,170
Bum bum bum.

4760
05:31:25,170 --> 05:31:26,070
Bum bum bum.

4761
05:31:26,410 --> 05:31:27,270
Bum bum bum.

4762
05:31:27,710 --> 05:31:28,310
Bum bum bum.

4763
05:31:32,900 --> 05:31:33,640
Bum bum bum.

4764
05:31:33,660 --> 05:31:35,880
How I feel when I play this game sometimes.

4765
05:31:40,400 --> 05:31:43,380
Oh my god, this is how I feel playing this game.

4766
05:31:44,840 --> 05:31:46,760
It's getting more intense.

4767
05:31:49,420 --> 05:31:52,720
How did I- I don't even- I was not focused in that game.

4768
05:31:52,840 --> 05:31:55,160
Oh, now you can see what hap- yeah, yep.

4769
05:31:57,260 --> 05:31:57,960
You'll live!

4770
05:31:59,940 --> 05:32:01,560
You're gonna live!

4771
05:32:02,720 --> 05:32:04,960
They're gonna fucking kill us after this.

4772
05:32:06,740 --> 05:32:08,140
They're- they're still gonna kill us.

4773
05:32:09,080 --> 05:32:10,780
They're definitely gonna kill us after this.

4774
05:32:11,380 --> 05:32:12,540
Oh my god.

4775
05:32:13,800 --> 05:32:14,900
Oh my god.

4776
05:32:14,900 --> 05:32:15,300
Oh my god.

4777
05:32:15,660 --> 05:32:18,080
Oh my god.

4778
05:32:24,960 --> 05:32:28,780
Oh, he's coming in.

4779
05:32:42,870 --> 05:32:43,890
He's grooting.

4780
05:32:45,550 --> 05:32:47,950
Oh god, okay.

4781
05:32:50,030 --> 05:32:51,130
He's grooting!

4782
05:32:51,130 --> 05:32:51,190
He's grooting!

4783
05:32:53,690 --> 05:32:56,690
Dr. Strange, you're fucking crazy!

4784
05:33:03,230 --> 05:33:04,390
Oh my god.

4785
05:33:05,450 --> 05:33:07,430
We're still putting a show!

4786
05:33:18,080 --> 05:33:20,160
That's what I'm trying to do!

4787
05:33:21,480 --> 05:33:23,200
Where are you guys?

4788
05:33:23,740 --> 05:33:25,580
Where the fuck are you guys?

4789
05:33:28,860 --> 05:33:30,060
I think I'm Groot.

4790
05:33:30,800 --> 05:33:34,800
Oh my god, where the fuck did you guys go?

4791
05:33:40,680 --> 05:33:42,100
Holy shit.

4792
05:33:46,560 --> 05:33:49,840
All I'm saying is that they were not there.

4793
05:33:50,140 --> 05:33:52,560
Me and Groot, we're homies.

4794
05:33:53,040 --> 05:33:54,800
We're tight like that.

4795
05:34:02,960 --> 05:34:03,620
He's grooting.

4796
05:34:07,260 --> 05:34:07,900
Nice.

4797
05:34:10,560 --> 05:34:11,900
Got you, Hawkeye!

4798
05:34:14,160 --> 05:34:17,480
Look at that, that's the first time I called him Hawkeye instead of Hanzo.

4799
05:34:20,000 --> 05:34:21,280
He's grooting.

4800
05:34:25,380 --> 05:34:26,440
Okay, this is fine.

4801
05:34:32,140 --> 05:34:33,960
No, not the car!

4802
05:34:37,060 --> 05:34:37,700
Okay.

4803
05:34:39,540 --> 05:34:40,600
I got you!

4804
05:34:47,440 --> 05:34:48,700
He is Groot.

4805
05:34:53,060 --> 05:34:55,520
Oh, that's awkward.

4806
05:34:56,460 --> 05:34:58,140
That's so awkward, guys.

4807
05:35:00,280 --> 05:35:01,920
That's so fucking awkward.

4808
05:35:02,800 --> 05:35:03,760
That's okay.

4809
05:35:04,660 --> 05:35:07,240
We're gonna make good use of both our support ults, right?

4810
05:35:10,320 --> 05:35:11,820
He doesn't know I'm right here.

4811
05:35:16,710 --> 05:35:17,930
That's a little awkward.

4812
05:35:22,220 --> 05:35:22,820
It's Groot.

4813
05:35:25,380 --> 05:35:26,480
Oh, he has the eye.

4814
05:35:33,540 --> 05:35:38,280
Oh, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

4815
05:35:38,540 --> 05:35:42,380
We're not fine, we're not fine, we're not fine, we're not fine, we're not fine.

4816
05:35:43,220 --> 05:35:44,180
We're not fine.

4817
05:35:44,840 --> 05:35:45,560
We are...

4818
05:35:45,920 --> 05:35:46,740
I'm here, though.

4819
05:35:47,540 --> 05:35:48,420
I die on point.

4820
05:35:51,080 --> 05:35:52,140
There's too many...

4821
05:35:52,140 --> 05:35:53,660
There's too many Groots.

4822
05:35:54,380 --> 05:35:57,100
There's too... there's too many Groots.

4823
05:35:57,380 --> 05:35:59,260
What do we do with all these Groots?

4824
05:36:08,230 --> 05:36:09,430
We're keeping you up.

4825
05:36:11,930 --> 05:36:12,510
Stop!

4826
05:36:12,910 --> 05:36:13,390
Stop!

4827
05:36:13,610 --> 05:36:14,130
Let me heal!

4828
05:36:14,570 --> 05:36:14,990
Stop!

4829
05:36:15,070 --> 05:36:16,270
I can't see you guys!

4830
05:36:21,150 --> 05:36:23,090
Am I not dancing?

4831
05:36:24,230 --> 05:36:25,310
Oh, I am.

4832
05:36:25,510 --> 05:36:26,290
I'm dancing.

4833
05:36:26,290 --> 05:36:26,570
I'm dancing.

4834
05:36:28,470 --> 05:36:29,870
I'm dancing.

4835
05:36:30,410 --> 05:36:33,830
I'm dancing.

4836
05:36:36,950 --> 05:36:38,570
I stopped dancing.

4837
05:36:38,810 --> 05:36:39,810
I didn't realize.

4838
05:36:45,800 --> 05:36:46,500
Okay, we're fine.

4839
05:36:55,560 --> 05:36:58,060
You're taking so much damage.

4840
05:36:58,220 --> 05:37:00,600
I'm feeling so stressed out now, for real.

4841
05:37:03,160 --> 05:37:05,280
Remember when I say support doesn't make me stressed?

4842
05:37:06,160 --> 05:37:09,560
This is the most damage I've ever seen them take.

4843
05:37:13,240 --> 05:37:20,720
I swear, they are... they are taking so much damage.

4844
05:37:21,720 --> 05:37:25,000
Like, what the fuck?

4845
05:37:34,320 --> 05:37:35,120
Jesus Christ.

4846
05:37:35,820 --> 05:37:39,300
It's just... it's just...

4847
05:37:39,300 --> 05:37:41,180
Oh, no!

4848
05:37:41,720 --> 05:37:42,200
No!

4849
05:37:42,480 --> 05:37:45,880
We're all gonna make me live!

4850
05:37:56,120 --> 05:37:58,280
Nothing died!

4851
05:38:00,440 --> 05:38:03,560
I have 47k healing!

4852
05:38:11,920 --> 05:38:13,400
Holy fuck!

4853
05:38:14,280 --> 05:38:15,260
Oh, my God!

4854
05:38:15,480 --> 05:38:16,800
There's no way!

4855
05:38:20,880 --> 05:38:21,620
Bro!

4856
05:38:24,620 --> 05:38:26,460
What do you want me to do?

4857
05:38:27,140 --> 05:38:29,820
I... all my heals are going to her tanks!

4858
05:38:33,090 --> 05:38:34,190
Oh, my God!

4859
05:38:34,190 --> 05:38:34,190
What?

4860
05:38:39,580 --> 05:38:41,560
I have 47k... oh, guys.

4861
05:38:43,040 --> 05:38:46,240
Guys, I have 47k healing, guys.

4862
05:38:55,320 --> 05:38:58,920
Guys, I don't think the DPS really want to swap, guys.

4863
05:39:01,400 --> 05:39:04,680
No zero... that's just a stupid excuse.

4864
05:39:05,920 --> 05:39:07,980
That's a fucking cop-out answer.

4865
05:39:14,880 --> 05:39:16,080
Dude, we cannot do this.

4866
05:39:16,180 --> 05:39:16,560
Hold on.

4867
05:39:26,020 --> 05:39:27,420
Alright, this is bad.

4868
05:39:28,560 --> 05:39:30,340
Uh, we're down a burst, so be careful.

4869
05:39:31,660 --> 05:39:33,140
What's wrong with purple?

4870
05:39:33,220 --> 05:39:34,260
I like purple.

4871
05:39:40,060 --> 05:39:44,580
Just rooting.

4872
05:39:45,420 --> 05:39:46,400
I'm right.

4873
05:39:55,760 --> 05:39:56,840
Up top, up top.

4874
05:39:59,580 --> 05:40:00,340
Zap.

4875
05:40:00,520 --> 05:40:01,220
Zap up there.

4876
05:40:04,400 --> 05:40:06,960
I'm getting so much free space!

4877
05:40:10,790 --> 05:40:11,330
Jesus.

4878
05:40:18,180 --> 05:40:20,520
I'm getting so much free space for that.

4879
05:40:21,500 --> 05:40:22,600
For no reason.

4880
05:40:34,900 --> 05:40:35,440
No!

4881
05:40:35,880 --> 05:40:36,020
What?

4882
05:40:36,660 --> 05:40:38,140
I pressed Q!

4883
05:40:46,840 --> 05:40:49,140
It had Q in there!

4884
05:40:51,200 --> 05:40:53,640
It showed on my screen!

4885
05:40:58,740 --> 05:41:00,240
That's their off-angles.

4886
05:41:03,800 --> 05:41:05,820
I'm like 1v3'ing on high with stream.

4887
05:41:06,240 --> 05:41:09,880
Portal behind me.

4888
05:41:11,180 --> 05:41:12,440
Oh, my God.

4889
05:41:12,560 --> 05:41:14,500
That's... oh, my... that tilted me.

4890
05:41:15,220 --> 05:41:16,700
That actually tilted me.

4891
05:41:20,730 --> 05:41:22,070
That tilted me.

4892
05:41:22,170 --> 05:41:23,430
Holy shit.

4893
05:41:24,570 --> 05:41:27,050
Cause that was a Q on my end, too.

4894
05:41:33,540 --> 05:41:35,460
I got pinged so hard.

4895
05:41:45,500 --> 05:41:45,840
Okay.

4896
05:41:50,260 --> 05:41:50,600
Nice.

4897
05:41:55,340 --> 05:41:55,680
Yay!

4898
05:41:57,900 --> 05:41:58,420
Oh, my God.

4899
05:41:58,460 --> 05:41:59,500
That's a lot to push, though.

4900
05:42:01,780 --> 05:42:02,640
Oh, my God.

4901
05:42:02,900 --> 05:42:03,460
Oh, my God.

4902
05:42:03,460 --> 05:42:04,000
This is a lot.

4903
05:42:04,960 --> 05:42:05,660
Oh, my God.

4904
05:42:06,640 --> 05:42:09,300
There's so much to push, though.

4905
05:42:13,900 --> 05:42:14,500
Oh!

4906
05:42:24,980 --> 05:42:26,220
Oh, my God.

4907
05:42:43,000 --> 05:42:43,400
Alright.

4908
05:42:44,500 --> 05:42:46,220
Three minutes to push that far.

4909
05:42:47,780 --> 05:42:48,180
Alright.

4910
05:42:48,420 --> 05:42:49,600
This is gonna be a little bit difficult.

4911
05:42:49,600 --> 05:42:52,540
It's gonna be a little difficult.

4912
05:42:53,080 --> 05:42:54,980
Just a little bit difficult.

4913
05:42:57,860 --> 05:43:00,740
Can we get... we have 52k healing.

4914
05:43:01,060 --> 05:43:04,400
If we had two tanks, I definitely could've got 70k healing.

4915
05:43:04,920 --> 05:43:05,360
I think.

4916
05:43:06,000 --> 05:43:07,420
I think if we had two tanks.

4917
05:43:08,260 --> 05:43:09,840
It was definitely possible.

4918
05:43:11,020 --> 05:43:11,580
Woo!

4919
05:43:17,820 --> 05:43:18,060
Woo!

4920
05:43:22,200 --> 05:43:22,760
Woo!

4921
05:43:25,400 --> 05:43:29,120
I'd be so sad if we hit grandmaster before we hit top 500.

4922
05:43:29,300 --> 05:43:31,280
Like, we're always chasing that top 500 dream.

4923
05:43:31,620 --> 05:43:33,380
And it's always two to three games.

4924
05:43:34,860 --> 05:43:35,420
Like...

4925
05:43:38,300 --> 05:43:39,960
The two to three games.

4926
05:43:40,280 --> 05:43:42,040
It's always two to three games.

4927
05:43:47,470 --> 05:43:48,830
I'm brewing.

4928
05:43:49,950 --> 05:43:50,850
I'm brewing.

4929
05:43:51,990 --> 05:43:53,270
I'm brewing.

4930
05:43:55,590 --> 05:43:56,770
I'm brewing.

4931
05:43:58,030 --> 05:43:59,270
I'm brewing.

4932
05:44:00,770 --> 05:44:01,470
I'm brewing.

4933
05:44:03,170 --> 05:44:03,910
I'm brewing.

4934
05:44:04,410 --> 05:44:05,090
I'm brewing.

4935
05:44:05,990 --> 05:44:07,050
I'm brewing.

4936
05:44:09,940 --> 05:44:10,450
I'm brewing.

4937
05:44:10,810 --> 05:44:11,050
I'm brewing.

4938
05:44:16,030 --> 05:44:17,550
Groot, Groot, Groot!

4939
05:44:19,390 --> 05:44:20,490
He's still Grooting!

4940
05:44:23,530 --> 05:44:24,390
Groot, Groot, Groot!

4941
05:44:24,590 --> 05:44:26,910
Jesus Christ, I don't know what to do, guys.

4942
05:44:27,990 --> 05:44:30,810
You guys take too much damage for me to do anything.

4943
05:44:36,260 --> 05:44:39,240
Guys, you guys take way too much damage, guys!

4944
05:44:49,440 --> 05:44:50,500
I am Groot.

4945
05:44:57,310 --> 05:44:59,030
Oh my god!

4946
05:44:59,030 --> 05:44:59,210
Yes!

4947
05:44:59,970 --> 05:45:00,490
Okay!

4948
05:45:01,090 --> 05:45:01,950
Like, what?

4949
05:45:02,450 --> 05:45:02,970
Okay!

4950
05:45:07,660 --> 05:45:08,620
Like, how?

4951
05:45:15,440 --> 05:45:17,880
I think we need a second tank, guys.

4952
05:45:22,900 --> 05:45:25,600
Guys, I think we need a second tank, guys.

4953
05:45:33,430 --> 05:45:34,230
I know, guys.

4954
05:45:34,310 --> 05:45:39,190
It might be five more games, guys, because DPS Ego is today.

4955
05:45:42,150 --> 05:45:43,510
You guys wanna come down here?

4956
05:45:44,370 --> 05:45:44,930
Oh...

4957
05:45:44,930 --> 05:45:45,970
You guys wanna come down here?

4958
05:45:47,490 --> 05:45:48,910
You guys wanna come down?

4959
05:45:49,950 --> 05:45:50,510
Oh...

4960
05:45:50,510 --> 05:45:51,730
Okay, I cannot heal.

4961
05:45:51,970 --> 05:45:55,790
My ult is not like infinite heals, guys.

4962
05:45:56,510 --> 05:45:57,070
It's...

4963
05:45:57,070 --> 05:45:58,510
It's like...

4964
05:45:59,490 --> 05:46:01,210
There's a finite in there.

4965
05:46:01,470 --> 05:46:01,870
It's a...

4966
05:46:01,870 --> 05:46:04,770
There's a finite and not an infinite.

4967
05:46:06,730 --> 05:46:09,070
No, we haven't got a kill and attack, guys.

4968
05:46:10,030 --> 05:46:11,570
It's a little concerning.

4969
05:46:18,430 --> 05:46:19,530
I'm gonna TP S.

4970
05:46:20,510 --> 05:46:20,850
Okay.

4971
05:46:24,230 --> 05:46:24,890
Alright!

4972
05:46:25,190 --> 05:46:26,710
This is the last ditch effort!

4973
05:46:34,190 --> 05:46:35,250
Do you think it'll be okay?

4974
05:46:37,280 --> 05:46:39,050
Do you think they'll be okay?

4975
05:46:39,770 --> 05:46:41,550
Do you think...

4976
05:46:41,550 --> 05:46:42,610
Do you think they'll be okay?

4977
05:46:48,400 --> 05:46:49,060
Guys!

4978
05:46:49,920 --> 05:46:50,320
Guys!

4979
05:46:50,320 --> 05:46:50,360
Guys!

4980
05:47:01,970 --> 05:47:03,850
Oh my god!

4981
05:47:04,450 --> 05:47:05,570
Oh my god!

4982
05:47:08,190 --> 05:47:10,590
Do you think SK knows a tank player that's...

4983
05:47:10,590 --> 05:47:11,590
Wait, what's my heal?

4984
05:47:11,950 --> 05:47:12,870
What's my heals at?

4985
05:47:13,390 --> 05:47:14,170
Oh my god.

4986
05:47:15,010 --> 05:47:15,850
Oh, fuck.

4987
05:47:16,790 --> 05:47:17,470
Oh, fuck.

4988
05:47:17,490 --> 05:47:18,290
That's so painful.

4989
05:47:18,650 --> 05:47:19,910
That's so painful.

4990
05:47:22,450 --> 05:47:23,630
Oh my god!

4991
05:47:24,550 --> 05:47:26,830
I'm at 60k heals!

4992
05:47:29,090 --> 05:47:30,690
Holy shit!

4993
05:47:33,650 --> 05:47:34,530
I'm at 60...

4994
05:47:39,330 --> 05:47:40,290
Oh my god.

4995
05:47:42,150 --> 05:47:43,050
That's crazy.

4996
05:47:43,410 --> 05:47:45,010
I'm at 60k heals.

4997
05:47:45,930 --> 05:47:47,710
How did I get there, you might wonder.

4998
05:47:49,570 --> 05:47:51,070
Oh my god.

4999
05:47:51,070 --> 05:47:52,410
Oh my god.

5000
05:47:52,510 --> 05:47:53,530
This always happens.

5001
05:47:57,130 --> 05:47:59,610
Alright, let's see.

5002
05:48:02,590 --> 05:48:03,950
That hurts.

5003
05:48:04,850 --> 05:48:06,910
This is the Gatsby curse right here.

5004
05:48:07,290 --> 05:48:10,610
It all started with Gatsby when they didn't avoid him.

5005
05:48:12,170 --> 05:48:13,730
This is the Gatsby curse.

5006
05:48:13,830 --> 05:48:14,850
It started here.

5007
05:48:15,710 --> 05:48:17,530
And then it never...

5008
05:48:17,530 --> 05:48:18,770
It never recovered.

5009
05:48:22,690 --> 05:48:25,630
The Gatsby curse was real here.

5010
05:48:26,930 --> 05:48:28,430
It never recovered.

5011
05:48:28,910 --> 05:48:30,530
Oh my god.

5012
05:48:31,130 --> 05:48:32,610
Oh, fuck.

5013
05:48:33,350 --> 05:48:34,430
Oh, fuck.

5014
05:48:37,030 --> 05:48:39,990
Do you know any tank players?

5015
05:48:41,270 --> 05:48:42,050
Online?

5016
05:48:42,750 --> 05:48:43,230
Lmao.

5017
05:48:57,540 --> 05:49:00,120
Oh, not a single one.

5018
05:49:00,220 --> 05:49:01,180
Oh!

5019
05:49:01,980 --> 05:49:05,160
Now we're just missing a tank player.

5020
05:49:08,470 --> 05:49:09,250
Oh, fuck.

5021
05:49:09,330 --> 05:49:09,530
Okay.

5022
05:49:10,470 --> 05:49:11,770
It's okay, we'll be fine.

5023
05:49:13,650 --> 05:49:14,530
It's okay.

5024
05:49:14,790 --> 05:49:17,370
This is what happens when you curse us like this.

5025
05:49:17,790 --> 05:49:18,130
Guys.

5026
05:49:18,950 --> 05:49:19,450
This is what...

5027
05:49:19,450 --> 05:49:20,330
You wanted this.

5028
05:49:21,130 --> 05:49:22,070
You wanted this.

5029
05:49:22,690 --> 05:49:25,170
Tomorrow we're cancelling the voice part of the stream.

5030
05:49:25,690 --> 05:49:27,750
It's Marvel Rivals and announcement.

5031
05:49:28,710 --> 05:49:29,570
It's over.

5032
05:49:30,490 --> 05:49:31,090
Lmao.

5033
05:49:33,450 --> 05:49:34,330
Lmao.

5034
05:49:35,490 --> 05:49:37,370
You wanted this.

5035
05:49:37,950 --> 05:49:41,350
It's Marvel Rivals and announcement.

5036
05:49:42,550 --> 05:49:43,430
Lmao.

5037
05:49:48,440 --> 05:49:50,660
You gave me the Curse of Ra.

5038
05:49:50,960 --> 05:49:52,600
You live with your mistakes.

5039
05:49:53,160 --> 05:49:55,080
You're living with your mistakes today.

5040
05:49:56,220 --> 05:49:57,100
Lmao.

5041
05:50:07,020 --> 05:50:07,920
Is it?

5042
05:50:09,220 --> 05:50:09,880
Wait, yes.

5043
05:50:10,160 --> 05:50:10,840
But you...

5044
05:50:10,840 --> 05:50:13,680
You are fucking sheep to sure for.

5045
05:50:14,320 --> 05:50:15,260
You're fucking...

5046
05:50:15,260 --> 05:50:17,200
You saw him be like, Curse of Ra.

5047
05:50:17,380 --> 05:50:18,060
You're like, hehe.

5048
05:50:18,500 --> 05:50:19,460
Curse of Ra.

5049
05:50:20,000 --> 05:50:20,980
You contributed.

5050
05:50:21,920 --> 05:50:24,520
You fucking contributed to the problem.

5051
05:50:28,000 --> 05:50:28,660
It's...

5052
05:50:28,660 --> 05:50:30,720
You know what you were doing.

5053
05:50:37,130 --> 05:50:37,790
Lmao.

5054
05:50:45,530 --> 05:50:46,170
Lmao.

5055
05:50:46,170 --> 05:50:47,690
Curse of Caspi.

5056
05:50:53,100 --> 05:50:54,060
Alright, here we go.

5057
05:50:56,160 --> 05:50:57,220
Here we go.

5058
05:50:58,080 --> 05:50:58,400
Okay.

5059
05:50:59,000 --> 05:50:59,640
This is fine.

5060
05:51:00,480 --> 05:51:01,080
I think I was...

5061
05:51:01,080 --> 05:51:01,820
I'm playing fine.

5062
05:51:02,020 --> 05:51:03,740
It's just RNG as always.

5063
05:51:04,120 --> 05:51:05,080
It's always RNG.

5064
05:51:05,660 --> 05:51:07,500
It's always RNG.

5065
05:51:09,960 --> 05:51:10,420
RNG.

5066
05:51:10,420 --> 05:51:13,760
The RNG-sus is not on our side today.

5067
05:51:15,880 --> 05:51:16,340
Run.

5068
05:51:16,680 --> 05:51:18,140
Woah, I am so fast.

5069
05:51:19,540 --> 05:51:20,560
I got the bubble.

5070
05:51:22,460 --> 05:51:25,240
I got the bubble, but there was no reason for me to have the bubble.

5071
05:51:29,070 --> 05:51:30,590
I didn't need to be that fast.

5072
05:51:37,580 --> 05:51:39,960
Woah, that scared the shit out of me.

5073
05:51:40,380 --> 05:51:41,740
I think I'm gonna put on the tank though.

5074
05:51:57,300 --> 05:51:58,160
Get off.

5075
05:51:58,360 --> 05:51:58,960
Be secure.

5076
05:52:01,740 --> 05:52:02,340
No.

5077
05:52:03,120 --> 05:52:04,880
Are you fucking kidding me?

5078
05:52:05,180 --> 05:52:05,500
Get off.

5079
05:52:07,800 --> 05:52:08,400
Please.

5080
05:52:11,280 --> 05:52:12,940
Oh my god!

5081
05:52:21,850 --> 05:52:23,070
Oh, they got it.

5082
05:52:25,050 --> 05:52:26,810
They got it yet again.

5083
05:52:32,420 --> 05:52:33,540
Where's Captain America?

5084
05:52:33,660 --> 05:52:34,400
You get this.

5085
05:52:34,860 --> 05:52:36,660
You're just gonna go in and feed.

5086
05:52:36,660 --> 05:52:37,520
I know it.

5087
05:52:43,910 --> 05:52:45,390
Oh no!

5088
05:52:45,930 --> 05:52:46,310
Oh!

5089
05:52:54,540 --> 05:52:55,300
I...

5090
05:52:55,300 --> 05:52:56,660
I can't...

5091
05:52:56,660 --> 05:52:57,200
I...

5092
05:52:57,200 --> 05:52:59,840
I can't heal through that.

5093
05:53:00,040 --> 05:53:02,540
I cannot heal through that.

5094
05:53:04,200 --> 05:53:05,520
There's no way.

5095
05:53:05,580 --> 05:53:07,240
They have to be doing...

5096
05:53:07,240 --> 05:53:08,820
There's no way.

5097
05:53:08,900 --> 05:53:10,300
That was crazy.

5098
05:53:11,040 --> 05:53:13,540
That was the craziest play they could have done.

5099
05:53:16,400 --> 05:53:17,700
Someone please shoot this.

5100
05:53:18,080 --> 05:53:19,200
Shoot the fucking thing.

5101
05:53:25,770 --> 05:53:26,250
No!

5102
05:53:30,460 --> 05:53:32,280
No, it was the moon dragon.

5103
05:53:32,620 --> 05:53:33,380
Not the moon dragon.

5104
05:53:33,480 --> 05:53:34,640
It was the fucking...

5105
05:53:34,640 --> 05:53:36,060
The moon knight.

5106
05:53:36,380 --> 05:53:37,880
Curse of the fucking whatever.

5107
05:53:38,600 --> 05:53:39,840
I don't fucking know what it's called.

5108
05:53:40,080 --> 05:53:42,040
He ulted with the Gibraltar.

5109
05:53:42,240 --> 05:53:43,080
Oh, not fucking Gibraltar.

5110
05:53:43,360 --> 05:53:43,800
Groot ult.

5111
05:53:44,300 --> 05:53:46,160
With the Gibraltar ult.

5112
05:53:47,580 --> 05:53:49,440
No, it's past three games.

5113
05:53:54,640 --> 05:53:55,300
We're...

5114
05:53:56,580 --> 05:53:59,040
We're at those demon hours now.

5115
05:54:00,800 --> 05:54:01,920
Shoot this!

5116
05:54:02,240 --> 05:54:02,840
You're in...

5117
05:54:02,840 --> 05:54:03,940
Oh my god, please.

5118
05:54:04,120 --> 05:54:05,740
Why is nobody shooting this?

5119
05:54:12,600 --> 05:54:14,500
Okay, I guess I'll shoot it.

5120
05:54:15,680 --> 05:54:16,460
That's fine.

5121
05:54:19,600 --> 05:54:19,980
Guys.

5122
05:54:20,740 --> 05:54:21,120
Guys.

5123
05:54:21,800 --> 05:54:22,440
Guys.

5124
05:54:22,860 --> 05:54:23,620
Guys.

5125
05:54:28,880 --> 05:54:30,100
Oh my god.

5126
05:54:30,180 --> 05:54:31,160
Oh my god, I think we might...

5127
05:54:31,160 --> 05:54:32,860
I can't believe we're gonna have to swap.

5128
05:54:33,120 --> 05:54:34,360
We're gonna have to...

5129
05:54:35,680 --> 05:54:36,880
We're gonna have to do...

5130
05:54:37,640 --> 05:54:39,940
Marvel rivals and announcement.

5131
05:54:40,460 --> 05:54:44,480
What is this hell that I fucking got myself caught into?

5132
05:54:45,240 --> 05:54:46,860
We're always three games.

5133
05:54:47,380 --> 05:54:49,480
Three games and then everything goes downhill.

5134
05:54:52,820 --> 05:54:56,340
Three games and then we all suck.

5135
05:54:56,900 --> 05:54:57,820
Oh yeah.

5136
05:55:00,860 --> 05:55:04,220
The Curse of Ra works at a specific time.

5137
05:55:10,150 --> 05:55:11,410
Oh my god.

5138
05:55:14,290 --> 05:55:15,090
Oh my god.

5139
05:55:15,450 --> 05:55:17,030
Oh my god, just one.

5140
05:55:17,930 --> 05:55:19,650
This curse to be broken.

5141
05:55:23,210 --> 05:55:24,830
I'm gonna give it to our Groot.

5142
05:55:25,230 --> 05:55:26,590
I have to give it to her tank.

5143
05:55:26,670 --> 05:55:27,930
They take way too much damage.

5144
05:55:28,770 --> 05:55:31,190
I would give it to DPS but...

5145
05:55:31,190 --> 05:55:31,820
Our tanks just...

5146
05:55:32,350 --> 05:55:35,010
Our tanks are fucking sponges.

5147
05:55:44,310 --> 05:55:46,290
They're actual sponge.

5148
05:55:47,930 --> 05:55:48,990
They're doing it again.

5149
05:55:49,250 --> 05:55:50,790
No, no, not again!

5150
05:55:52,970 --> 05:55:53,730
I need to just...

5151
05:55:53,730 --> 05:55:55,070
I just need to like not...

5152
05:55:55,070 --> 05:55:58,810
I just need to like not even ult when I see that combo.

5153
05:55:59,390 --> 05:56:00,970
I just go GG's.

5154
05:56:01,690 --> 05:56:03,030
And just die.

5155
05:56:08,410 --> 05:56:11,310
It was like reflex for me too.

5156
05:56:14,290 --> 05:56:15,770
I'm sorry, Dr. Strange.

5157
05:56:16,130 --> 05:56:17,410
You're not gonna live.

5158
05:56:22,850 --> 05:56:25,070
Oh my god, it was literally like...

5159
05:56:25,990 --> 05:56:28,070
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

5160
05:56:31,900 --> 05:56:33,140
Groot, Groot, please.

5161
05:56:33,760 --> 05:56:34,880
You're not okay, Groot.

5162
05:56:39,430 --> 05:56:40,810
Oh, we broke it.

5163
05:56:44,430 --> 05:56:45,330
Oh my god.

5164
05:56:45,810 --> 05:56:47,890
I'm watching you soar.

5165
05:56:48,370 --> 05:56:50,450
Fly, you beautiful angel.

5166
05:56:56,240 --> 05:56:57,920
Fly, you beautiful...

5167
05:57:01,700 --> 05:57:02,420
Okay.

5168
05:57:06,480 --> 05:57:07,200
Nice.

5169
05:57:07,320 --> 05:57:08,000
Okay, he has ult.

5170
05:57:09,140 --> 05:57:10,280
Oh, when he...

5171
05:57:10,280 --> 05:57:11,240
Oh my god, this is why...

5172
05:57:11,240 --> 05:57:12,200
This is why I won't get ult.

5173
05:57:13,640 --> 05:57:15,780
Because now people are doing ult combos now.

5174
05:57:16,260 --> 05:57:18,720
They're figuring out ult combos, guys.

5175
05:57:18,900 --> 05:57:20,700
Fucking ult combos.

5176
05:57:22,740 --> 05:57:24,800
They're figuring it out.

5177
05:57:25,780 --> 05:57:26,400
Guys.

5178
05:57:30,360 --> 05:57:32,380
Ult combos, guys.

5179
05:57:41,570 --> 05:57:42,350
I'm meta.

5180
05:57:46,230 --> 05:57:48,530
Like, I knew it was...

5181
05:57:48,530 --> 05:57:49,990
But you're still alive.

5182
05:57:51,410 --> 05:57:52,730
You're still alive.

5183
05:57:52,790 --> 05:57:53,930
So we're gonna...

5184
05:57:53,930 --> 05:57:56,670
We're gonna figure this out together.

5185
05:58:00,330 --> 05:58:01,130
Yeah.

5186
05:58:14,400 --> 05:58:15,740
If I live...

5187
05:58:16,680 --> 05:58:17,200
Yeah.

5188
05:58:23,740 --> 05:58:24,780
Oh my god, he's gonna eat.

5189
05:58:26,020 --> 05:58:27,300
Oh my god, he ate.

5190
05:58:28,260 --> 05:58:30,000
Oh, he captured it though.

5191
05:58:34,620 --> 05:58:35,580
No, Jeff!

5192
05:58:37,700 --> 05:58:38,920
Okay, I got him though.

5193
05:58:46,860 --> 05:58:47,840
Beat him, beat him up!

5194
05:58:55,730 --> 05:58:56,850
Oh, he's fucking dead.

5195
05:58:57,190 --> 05:58:58,570
Oh, I'm dead!

5196
05:59:05,370 --> 05:59:05,730
What?

5197
05:59:07,230 --> 05:59:08,270
What?

5198
05:59:13,410 --> 05:59:13,930
What?

5199
05:59:19,720 --> 05:59:20,640
Hey guys.

5200
05:59:21,380 --> 05:59:22,040
That'd be cool.

5201
05:59:26,770 --> 05:59:27,810
Let's...

5202
05:59:27,810 --> 05:59:29,830
Oh, we're not gonna...

5203
05:59:35,270 --> 05:59:36,670
Oh my god.

5204
05:59:37,490 --> 05:59:39,050
We're back in the circus.

5205
05:59:39,680 --> 05:59:42,690
We're actually back in the circus.

5206
05:59:49,880 --> 05:59:51,610
We're back in the circus.

5207
05:59:52,410 --> 05:59:53,070
How?

5208
05:59:53,790 --> 05:59:54,450
How?

5209
05:59:54,830 --> 05:59:56,030
How did we get back?

5210
05:59:56,310 --> 05:59:57,090
We left.

5211
05:59:57,770 --> 06:00:01,030
We left and now we're back.

5212
06:00:02,190 --> 06:00:02,910
How?

5213
06:00:05,000 --> 06:00:06,050
We're back.

5214
06:00:09,840 --> 06:00:12,230
We're back in the circus.

5215
06:00:16,130 --> 06:00:17,710
Oh my god.

5216
06:00:19,050 --> 06:00:20,410
Oh my god.

5217
06:00:21,270 --> 06:00:21,970
Oh my god.

5218
06:00:22,390 --> 06:00:23,010
I can't.

5219
06:00:23,690 --> 06:00:25,050
I fucking can't.

5220
06:00:26,110 --> 06:00:26,750
Oh my god.

5221
06:00:28,230 --> 06:00:30,690
If I get back to diamond, we're stopping there.

5222
06:00:31,030 --> 06:00:32,570
We're stopping there.

5223
06:00:35,030 --> 06:00:36,530
Oh my god.

5224
06:00:38,390 --> 06:00:40,350
I can't believe it.

5225
06:00:41,770 --> 06:00:42,650
Oh my god.

5226
06:00:42,810 --> 06:00:43,030
Wait.

5227
06:00:43,270 --> 06:00:44,530
No, it's...

5228
06:00:45,370 --> 06:00:47,370
No, we'll find a better song.

5229
06:00:47,670 --> 06:00:48,130
Guys.

5230
06:00:48,370 --> 06:00:49,150
We're gonna find...

5231
06:00:49,150 --> 06:00:50,610
No, we're not doing...

5232
06:00:50,610 --> 06:00:52,370
We're gonna find a better sound...

5233
06:00:52,370 --> 06:00:53,310
song at it.

5234
06:00:57,650 --> 06:00:58,170
Okay.

5235
06:01:02,160 --> 06:01:02,920
Don't worry.

5236
06:01:03,160 --> 06:01:04,440
I found a good song.

5237
06:01:07,860 --> 06:01:08,740
Here we go.

5238
06:01:12,210 --> 06:01:13,130
No, wait.

5239
06:01:13,210 --> 06:01:14,510
That's copyrighted.

5240
06:01:19,670 --> 06:01:21,110
Copyright free.

5241
06:01:27,670 --> 06:01:29,550
Wait, that's so scary.

5242
06:01:30,290 --> 06:01:31,630
That's a scary...

5243
06:01:31,630 --> 06:01:32,190
Oh, wait.

5244
06:01:32,270 --> 06:01:32,770
Is this?

5245
06:01:37,210 --> 06:01:37,550
No.

5246
06:01:37,730 --> 06:01:38,810
I'm trying to...

5247
06:01:38,810 --> 06:01:39,110
No.

5248
06:01:39,870 --> 06:01:40,590
No!

5249
06:01:41,370 --> 06:01:42,030
Okay.

5250
06:01:42,530 --> 06:01:43,250
Alright, guys.

5251
06:01:44,370 --> 06:01:48,650
When you get in the circus, you don't get to play Luna anymore.

5252
06:01:49,130 --> 06:01:51,870
You can't play Luna anymore when you're in the circus.

5253
06:01:52,710 --> 06:01:54,210
When you're in the circus.

5254
06:01:58,280 --> 06:01:59,880
Sad music.

5255
06:02:14,240 --> 06:02:16,440
We're just gonna go straight on.

5256
06:02:29,400 --> 06:02:30,760
She can have Luna.

5257
06:02:32,160 --> 06:02:33,600
I'll play Mantis.

5258
06:02:37,620 --> 06:02:38,240
It's okay, guys.

5259
06:02:38,300 --> 06:02:38,920
Give me a sec.

5260
06:02:39,000 --> 06:02:42,480
I know you want the clown nose, but I have to make a small edit.

5261
06:02:43,680 --> 06:02:49,900
I have to make a small edit of how I feel in the inside.

5262
06:02:52,480 --> 06:02:53,180
Oh, no.

5263
06:02:53,260 --> 06:02:53,840
I can't.

5264
06:02:53,840 --> 06:02:55,640
I can't make my small edit yet.

5265
06:03:00,550 --> 06:03:01,230
Bum bum.

5266
06:03:05,460 --> 06:03:06,960
Play whatever you feel like playing.

5267
06:03:09,140 --> 06:03:11,060
I am a guardian against evil.

5268
06:03:11,220 --> 06:03:12,600
30 seconds before you attack.

5269
06:03:12,840 --> 06:03:13,460
Get ready.

5270
06:03:16,740 --> 06:03:17,420
Whoa.

5271
06:03:18,320 --> 06:03:20,000
What year is it where you come from?

5272
06:03:20,620 --> 06:03:21,960
Not years anywhere.

5273
06:03:23,100 --> 06:03:24,760
All that matters is now.

5274
06:03:25,340 --> 06:03:25,640
Right.

5275
06:03:26,300 --> 06:03:26,860
Gotta be present.

5276
06:03:34,920 --> 06:03:37,220
The battle starts in 5...

5277
06:03:37,220 --> 06:03:38,060
4...

5278
06:03:38,060 --> 06:03:38,820
3...

5279
06:03:38,820 --> 06:03:39,760
2...

5280
06:03:39,760 --> 06:03:40,280
1!

5281
06:03:42,040 --> 06:03:42,940
You're mine!

5282
06:03:44,740 --> 06:03:45,320
I'm not Luna.

5283
06:03:45,320 --> 06:03:45,880
I need to remember that.

5284
06:03:46,240 --> 06:03:47,000
I'm not Luna.

5285
06:04:01,550 --> 06:04:02,950
Feelin' power!

5286
06:04:12,290 --> 06:04:13,550
That's fine.

5287
06:04:18,270 --> 06:04:19,190
Feelin' power!

5288
06:04:22,150 --> 06:04:23,830
You feelin' power!

5289
06:04:40,910 --> 06:04:41,390
Go!

5290
06:04:42,570 --> 06:04:44,230
Feel so strong!

5291
06:04:49,120 --> 06:04:49,600
No.

5292
06:04:49,760 --> 06:04:50,000
No.

5293
06:04:50,180 --> 06:04:50,420
No.

5294
06:04:50,660 --> 06:04:50,860
No!

5295
06:04:55,960 --> 06:04:56,440
Goodbye.

5296
06:04:56,980 --> 06:04:57,480
Get one back.

5297
06:05:02,720 --> 06:05:05,040
Oh my god, we capped it though.

5298
06:05:05,680 --> 06:05:06,400
We capped it.

5299
06:05:13,640 --> 06:05:34,620
Oh my god.

5300
06:05:34,640 --> 06:05:36,380
You got this.

5301
06:05:36,540 --> 06:05:37,840
You're gonna feel so strong.

5302
06:05:41,660 --> 06:05:43,460
You're gonna feel so strong.

5303
06:05:47,960 --> 06:05:49,250
But what if...

5304
06:05:49,620 --> 06:05:51,940
What if I don't wanna feel spider-tapped?

5305
06:05:52,580 --> 06:05:56,280
What if I don't wanna feel like spi- Oh my god.

5306
06:06:00,900 --> 06:06:05,520
The muse- The old stuff.

5307
06:06:12,440 --> 06:06:14,380
Feelin'- Feel strong.

5308
06:06:14,980 --> 06:06:16,260
Feel so fucking strong.

5309
06:06:19,740 --> 06:06:20,480
Goodbye.

5310
06:06:22,440 --> 06:06:23,580
Feel strong!

5311
06:06:25,580 --> 06:06:29,160
The moon- If anything happens to you, it's your- You're bad.

5312
06:06:34,450 --> 06:06:35,830
Where are they?

5313
06:06:39,730 --> 06:06:40,330
Go!

5314
06:06:42,730 --> 06:06:43,790
Beat him up!

5315
06:06:52,500 --> 06:06:54,200
Fucking you're so strong!

5316
06:06:55,500 --> 06:06:56,600
Okay, there you go.

5317
06:06:58,520 --> 06:06:59,120
Huge.

5318
06:06:59,320 --> 06:07:02,080
I told you I'm not one trick anymore.

5319
06:07:03,340 --> 06:07:05,400
I'm not a one trick no more, guys.

5320
06:07:05,400 --> 06:07:06,420
I told you.

5321
06:07:07,180 --> 06:07:09,500
I told you I can do it!

5322
06:07:10,700 --> 06:07:12,300
I can do it!

5323
06:07:12,380 --> 06:07:14,740
I can play other characters!

5324
06:07:21,480 --> 06:07:22,690
Be empowered!

5325
06:07:24,450 --> 06:07:25,870
Be inspired!

5326
06:07:29,400 --> 06:07:31,050
Go do your thing!

5327
06:07:33,570 --> 06:07:35,750
Keep being strong!

5328
06:07:43,490 --> 06:07:44,250
Alright.

5329
06:07:44,630 --> 06:07:46,310
Go, do your thing again!

5330
06:07:47,910 --> 06:07:49,230
Keep doing your thing!

5331
06:07:51,610 --> 06:07:52,490
You also!

5332
06:07:56,990 --> 06:07:58,370
Alright, that's fine.

5333
06:07:58,850 --> 06:07:59,410
Woah!

5334
06:07:59,850 --> 06:08:00,910
That's not fine.

5335
06:08:01,490 --> 06:08:02,690
Hey, we can all heal this now.

5336
06:08:09,470 --> 06:08:10,570
Goodbye, all of you.

5337
06:08:25,960 --> 06:08:27,180
Be empowered!

5338
06:08:28,480 --> 06:08:29,640
That's right!

5339
06:08:30,740 --> 06:08:32,340
I'm not a Luna main!

5340
06:08:32,820 --> 06:08:35,100
I'm not a Luna one trick!

5341
06:08:35,740 --> 06:08:38,420
I can play other characters!

5342
06:08:39,720 --> 06:08:42,240
The music is getting a bit upbeat.

5343
06:08:47,300 --> 06:08:47,980
Okay.

5344
06:08:48,940 --> 06:08:49,900
Let me adjust.

5345
06:08:51,660 --> 06:08:53,020
Look, if we...

5346
06:08:54,540 --> 06:08:56,060
We need to do this.

5347
06:08:56,220 --> 06:08:56,760
If we wanna...

5348
06:08:58,260 --> 06:08:58,980
Okay.

5349
06:08:59,600 --> 06:09:00,460
Save as.

5350
06:09:04,720 --> 06:09:06,700
Alright, I'll put on my clown nose.

5351
06:09:08,200 --> 06:09:09,020
Next game.

5352
06:09:10,480 --> 06:09:12,540
I'll put it on next game.

5353
06:09:13,600 --> 06:09:15,880
I told you I can play other characters now.

5354
06:09:17,780 --> 06:09:19,400
I told you.

5355
06:09:20,080 --> 06:09:24,100
I told you I know how to play other healers now.

5356
06:09:24,320 --> 06:09:26,140
It only took me one day.

5357
06:09:27,760 --> 06:09:32,100
It only took me one fucking day.

5358
06:09:35,850 --> 06:09:36,810
Are we close?

5359
06:09:41,410 --> 06:09:43,650
I'm back in the circus.

5360
06:09:44,150 --> 06:09:45,390
What do you think?

5361
06:09:46,830 --> 06:09:48,650
I had optimism.

5362
06:09:49,330 --> 06:09:51,210
I felt like I was a god.

5363
06:09:51,550 --> 06:09:53,510
I get to ban other characters.

5364
06:09:54,570 --> 06:09:56,470
And then we're back here.

5365
06:09:57,890 --> 06:09:59,690
In the pits.

5366
06:10:03,710 --> 06:10:05,310
Be inspired.

5367
06:10:05,750 --> 06:10:06,390
Woah.

5368
06:10:06,810 --> 06:10:08,350
Be inspired again.

5369
06:10:09,370 --> 06:10:10,150
You too.

5370
06:10:12,150 --> 06:10:12,950
Woah.

5371
06:10:15,910 --> 06:10:17,530
Feel strong again?

5372
06:10:17,890 --> 06:10:18,990
You know you want to.

5373
06:10:24,000 --> 06:10:25,540
Go do your thing.

5374
06:10:26,360 --> 06:10:27,080
You too.

5375
06:10:27,320 --> 06:10:27,940
Keep punching.

5376
06:10:28,280 --> 06:10:29,060
It's so funny.

5377
06:10:30,200 --> 06:10:31,500
Just keep punching.

5378
06:10:32,320 --> 06:10:32,700
You too.

5379
06:10:32,780 --> 06:10:33,560
Do your thing.

5380
06:10:39,390 --> 06:10:40,590
Do your thing.

5381
06:10:41,210 --> 06:10:41,790
Oh shit.

5382
06:10:45,660 --> 06:10:46,580
Oh shit.

5383
06:10:49,260 --> 06:10:50,860
Okay, I messed that up though.

5384
06:10:53,300 --> 06:10:54,860
I definitely messed that up.

5385
06:11:00,020 --> 06:11:00,880
That's fine.

5386
06:11:01,300 --> 06:11:02,780
Doctor Strange, do your thing.

5387
06:11:02,880 --> 06:11:04,020
I made you strong.

5388
06:11:04,020 --> 06:11:04,660
Strong.

5389
06:11:08,740 --> 06:11:11,900
This her projectile is so fucking weird though, not gonna lie.

5390
06:11:18,020 --> 06:11:19,020
That's fine.

5391
06:11:20,020 --> 06:11:21,800
You gotta feel strong too.

5392
06:11:27,050 --> 06:11:27,990
Oh no.

5393
06:11:31,730 --> 06:11:32,350
Oh no.

5394
06:11:32,530 --> 06:11:33,010
No!

5395
06:11:33,270 --> 06:11:35,070
You can eat me?

5396
06:11:35,670 --> 06:11:36,310
No.

5397
06:11:36,650 --> 06:11:37,970
No, I didn't know.

5398
06:11:38,290 --> 06:11:40,590
I didn't know you can eat.

5399
06:11:41,070 --> 06:11:42,830
I thought it was just like Luna.

5400
06:11:44,970 --> 06:11:46,050
That's so fucked.

5401
06:11:46,730 --> 06:11:47,990
You can eat.

5402
06:11:48,470 --> 06:11:49,570
Now I know.

5403
06:11:49,910 --> 06:11:51,590
I never realized.

5404
06:11:53,110 --> 06:11:59,690
I never realized you can get bored when you ult as Mantis.

5405
06:12:01,870 --> 06:12:03,350
Feel strong.

5406
06:12:08,720 --> 06:12:10,220
Feel strong.

5407
06:12:14,270 --> 06:12:15,050
That's fine.

5408
06:12:20,970 --> 06:12:22,530
Feel strong.

5409
06:12:23,710 --> 06:12:25,350
Feel so strong.

5410
06:12:29,250 --> 06:12:30,590
You wanna punch somebody?

5411
06:12:30,790 --> 06:12:31,570
Go in there.

5412
06:12:32,590 --> 06:12:34,390
Punch for your heart's desires.

5413
06:12:39,960 --> 06:12:40,600
He has eye.

5414
06:12:41,720 --> 06:12:43,080
He has gonna eye after this.

5415
06:12:48,780 --> 06:12:49,300
Get out.

5416
06:12:49,440 --> 06:12:49,960
Get out.

5417
06:12:52,980 --> 06:12:54,020
That's fine.

5418
06:12:55,360 --> 06:12:56,260
You know what?

5419
06:12:57,540 --> 06:12:59,660
Maybe I should just play Mantis.

5420
06:12:59,660 --> 06:13:00,880
Fuck this.

5421
06:13:04,180 --> 06:13:06,700
You know what?

5422
06:13:07,020 --> 06:13:09,180
I'm gonna start playing other characters.

5423
06:13:12,990 --> 06:13:14,050
I'm scared now.

5424
06:13:14,650 --> 06:13:15,130
I'm scared.

5425
06:13:23,480 --> 06:13:24,600
There

5426
06:13:29,900 --> 06:13:31,280
it is!

5427
06:13:32,480 --> 06:13:33,880
Let's go!

5428
06:13:35,240 --> 06:13:37,840
I feel so inspired!

5429
06:13:37,840 --> 06:13:38,160
Dude!

5430
06:13:40,100 --> 06:13:40,840
Alright.

5431
06:13:41,300 --> 06:13:42,180
They still have...

5432
06:13:48,640 --> 06:13:50,180
Guys, I fucked up.

5433
06:13:51,180 --> 06:13:51,340
No!

5434
06:13:51,900 --> 06:13:52,260
No!

5435
06:13:53,000 --> 06:13:54,400
I can't!

5436
06:13:54,980 --> 06:13:55,800
I can't!

5437
06:13:58,360 --> 06:13:58,540
I can't!

5438
06:13:58,540 --> 06:13:58,660
I can't!

5439
06:13:58,680 --> 06:13:59,360
I can't!

5440
06:14:02,040 --> 06:14:04,520
Every fucking time!

5441
06:14:07,280 --> 06:14:10,280
I'll never leave this fucking map.

5442
06:14:10,280 --> 06:14:12,720
I'll never leave.

5443
06:14:14,440 --> 06:14:16,240
He'll always get me.

5444
06:14:17,280 --> 06:14:18,960
He'll always find a way.

5445
06:14:22,840 --> 06:14:25,240
He'll always find a way.

5446
06:14:30,780 --> 06:14:33,060
He'll always find a way.

5447
06:14:34,060 --> 06:14:36,500
I like reflex try to heal them by shooting.

5448
06:14:36,920 --> 06:14:40,480
It's like buy reflex too.

5449
06:14:41,240 --> 06:14:43,980
Cause I feel like I'm playing Luna.

5450
06:14:44,240 --> 06:14:46,400
And I've been playing Luna for a while now.

5451
06:14:46,680 --> 06:14:51,490
I feel inspired.

5452
06:14:53,750 --> 06:14:54,290
There you go.

5453
06:14:54,590 --> 06:14:55,570
Oh shit!

5454
06:14:59,810 --> 06:15:00,490
No!

5455
06:15:01,610 --> 06:15:03,630
I almost killed him!

5456
06:15:08,200 --> 06:15:09,400
Oh my god!

5457
06:15:10,860 --> 06:15:11,380
That's fine.

5458
06:15:12,780 --> 06:15:13,760
So much Luna.

5459
06:15:15,440 --> 06:15:16,520
So much Luna.

5460
06:15:16,520 --> 06:15:18,160
But I'm learning how to play.

5461
06:15:18,380 --> 06:15:20,880
I'm learning how to play Mantis.

5462
06:15:22,100 --> 06:15:23,480
Be inspired.

5463
06:15:24,440 --> 06:15:25,780
Be inspired.

5464
06:15:26,880 --> 06:15:28,800
You be inspired too.

5465
06:15:30,340 --> 06:15:32,220
I can't heal you over there.

5466
06:15:32,820 --> 06:15:34,660
But you're gonna be so inspired.

5467
06:15:39,940 --> 06:15:41,180
Go punch!

5468
06:15:41,800 --> 06:15:43,880
Go fucking punch!

5469
06:15:48,140 --> 06:15:49,960
You go punch too!

5470
06:15:51,300 --> 06:15:52,340
Oh he's dead.

5471
06:15:55,550 --> 06:15:56,550
Go do your thing!

5472
06:15:59,330 --> 06:16:00,650
Go do your thing!

5473
06:16:01,650 --> 06:16:02,090
Go!

5474
06:16:07,200 --> 06:16:07,960
That's fucking right.

5475
06:16:08,040 --> 06:16:08,800
You made me so angry.

5476
06:16:09,140 --> 06:16:09,800
Oh that's fucking right!

5477
06:16:10,100 --> 06:16:10,640
That's fucking right!

5478
06:16:10,840 --> 06:16:11,420
That's fucking right!

5479
06:16:17,200 --> 06:16:19,020
If I can go up to you.

5480
06:16:23,740 --> 06:16:24,660
I'm kidding.

5481
06:16:27,160 --> 06:16:28,220
That's fucking right.

5482
06:16:29,060 --> 06:16:30,700
Hope you remember who I am.

5483
06:16:38,280 --> 06:16:39,340
Go do your thing.

5484
06:16:42,280 --> 06:16:43,140
Oh my god.

5485
06:16:43,260 --> 06:16:43,760
Oh my god.

5486
06:16:43,880 --> 06:16:44,640
I'm so sorry.

5487
06:16:44,880 --> 06:16:45,380
I did it.

5488
06:16:45,640 --> 06:16:46,940
I'm so-

5489
06:16:52,930 --> 06:16:54,890
My game crashed!

5490
06:16:57,930 --> 06:16:58,450
No!

5491
06:17:05,780 --> 06:17:08,080
Alright, that's how we recall it.

5492
06:17:11,660 --> 06:17:14,960
My game actually crashed!

5493
06:17:16,720 --> 06:17:20,440
I've never had a- Oh my god and we won too!

5494
06:17:20,900 --> 06:17:22,000
We're gonna win!

5495
06:17:25,100 --> 06:17:26,620
I don't think I can get back in time.

5496
06:17:27,540 --> 06:17:28,720
I don't think so.

5497
06:17:30,560 --> 06:17:32,200
I think the game ended.

5498
06:17:38,660 --> 06:17:41,020
That's so cruel!

5499
06:17:41,500 --> 06:17:43,220
That's so cruel!

5500
06:17:44,280 --> 06:17:46,580
That's actually so cruel!

5501
06:17:51,840 --> 06:17:53,400
Can I get back in?

5502
06:17:58,050 --> 06:17:59,270
Reconnect!

5503
06:18:00,290 --> 06:18:01,290
Reconnect!

5504
06:18:02,390 --> 06:18:04,030
Oh my god!

5505
06:18:06,010 --> 06:18:08,250
Life's not fair!

5506
06:18:14,250 --> 06:18:16,350
Oh my god!

5507
06:18:17,940 --> 06:18:19,070
Oh my god!

5508
06:18:21,070 --> 06:18:23,400
I'm coming back team!

5509
06:18:24,790 --> 06:18:26,390
Holy shit!

5510
06:18:28,750 --> 06:18:31,830
I died and everything went to hell!

5511
06:18:32,410 --> 06:18:33,230
Could be inspired.

5512
06:18:36,390 --> 06:18:37,810
Oh my god.

5513
06:18:39,360 --> 06:18:40,710
That was actually fucked.

5514
06:18:41,870 --> 06:18:42,870
That was so fucked.

5515
06:18:43,770 --> 06:18:45,890
I can't believe that actually happened though.

5516
06:18:49,850 --> 06:18:52,110
Oh my god I can't- Oh shit!

5517
06:18:53,710 --> 06:18:54,670
That's right.

5518
06:19:00,020 --> 06:19:01,120
Be inspired.

5519
06:19:05,840 --> 06:19:07,380
I'm gonna fucking make sure you keep punching.

5520
06:19:09,280 --> 06:19:10,340
Keep punching!

5521
06:19:10,820 --> 06:19:12,440
Just keep punching!

5522
06:19:14,980 --> 06:19:16,860
Just keep punching!

5523
06:19:16,860 --> 06:19:18,660
Keep punching!

5524
06:19:18,660 --> 06:19:20,680
No, I'm gonna keep punching too!

5525
06:19:21,420 --> 06:19:24,120
No, no, no get away from me!

5526
06:19:27,000 --> 06:19:29,880
Oh he ate his own teammate!

5527
06:19:35,690 --> 06:19:37,450
That's so fucked!

5528
06:19:39,770 --> 06:19:41,330
Oh my god!

5529
06:19:45,660 --> 06:19:46,620
Where is he?

5530
06:19:46,920 --> 06:19:47,400
Where is he?

5531
06:19:47,740 --> 06:19:50,920
Oh my god!

5532
06:19:51,600 --> 06:19:55,240
I can't believe he did the eye and I crashed!

5533
06:19:56,220 --> 06:19:59,240
I can't believe his Jeff ate him!

5534
06:20:00,640 --> 06:20:04,340
Oh my god the Jeff fucking ate his eye!

5535
06:20:08,350 --> 06:20:10,310
Oh my god.

5536
06:20:11,770 --> 06:20:12,690
Okay.

5537
06:20:15,230 --> 06:20:16,150
Alright.

5538
06:20:16,770 --> 06:20:17,410
It's fine.

5539
06:20:18,410 --> 06:20:19,670
It's fine.

5540
06:20:19,930 --> 06:20:20,770
We were fine.

5541
06:20:21,670 --> 06:20:23,270
Everything was okay.

5542
06:20:23,750 --> 06:20:27,910
Everything was okay at the end.

5543
06:20:32,270 --> 06:20:35,030
Everything was okay in the end.

5544
06:20:35,710 --> 06:20:36,410
We're fine.

5545
06:20:37,270 --> 06:20:38,410
Oh my god.

5546
06:20:39,170 --> 06:20:40,630
That could have been bad.

5547
06:20:41,390 --> 06:20:42,590
But it wasn't.

5548
06:20:43,350 --> 06:20:44,870
And that's all that matters.

5549
06:20:46,370 --> 06:20:49,070
No guys, we didn't fully crash.

5550
06:20:49,070 --> 06:20:53,450
It's still possible to at least get back to Diamond.

5551
06:20:57,330 --> 06:20:59,070
But before I do...

5552
06:21:00,910 --> 06:21:03,270
Wait, am I still in the group?

5553
06:21:06,370 --> 06:21:07,550
Oh I'm not.

5554
06:21:07,790 --> 06:21:08,130
Wait.

5555
06:21:08,470 --> 06:21:09,090
I'm not.

5556
06:21:12,350 --> 06:21:13,030
Wait.

5557
06:21:14,870 --> 06:21:18,530
I crashed and got kicked out of the group.

5558
06:21:21,210 --> 06:21:21,610
Lol.

5559
06:21:25,950 --> 06:21:28,950
I'm a two... No, I can play cloak and that.

5560
06:21:29,070 --> 06:21:29,330
Wait, okay.

5561
06:21:29,550 --> 06:21:30,250
Before... That's good.

5562
06:21:30,290 --> 06:21:30,970
That gives me time.

5563
06:21:31,270 --> 06:21:32,450
That gives me time to set up.

5564
06:21:32,970 --> 06:21:34,010
Okay, give me a sec.

5565
06:21:34,790 --> 06:21:35,190
Alright.

5566
06:21:36,990 --> 06:21:38,270
That gives me time, chat.

5567
06:21:41,440 --> 06:21:43,820
That gives me time to do what I wanted to do.

5568
06:21:56,530 --> 06:21:56,930
Alright.

5569
06:21:59,230 --> 06:22:00,290
Oh, it's not centered.

5570
06:22:00,630 --> 06:22:00,910
Sorry.

5571
06:22:02,690 --> 06:22:05,510
Now it's a sad clown nose.

5572
06:22:08,820 --> 06:22:12,240
Now it's a sad clown nose.

5573
06:22:15,040 --> 06:22:16,440
There we go.

5574
06:22:23,620 --> 06:22:26,840
Now we're the sad clown.

5575
06:22:29,080 --> 06:22:31,000
We're a sad clown.

5576
06:22:31,120 --> 06:22:32,480
We're gonna queue one up.

5577
06:22:33,600 --> 06:22:35,960
We're sad clowning.

5578
06:22:40,580 --> 06:22:42,900
Oh my god.

5579
06:22:43,260 --> 06:22:44,940
At least I'll have...

5580
06:22:44,940 --> 06:22:47,020
At least I'll have like...

5581
06:22:47,540 --> 06:22:49,080
My ping again.

5582
06:22:53,740 --> 06:22:54,420
It's fine.

5583
06:22:54,500 --> 06:22:55,880
I can mantis now.

5584
06:22:56,520 --> 06:22:57,360
Oh wait.

5585
06:22:58,720 --> 06:22:59,180
Also...

5586
06:22:59,640 --> 06:23:00,760
To fit the theme.

5587
06:23:01,480 --> 06:23:03,160
We gotta fit the theme.

5588
06:23:08,820 --> 06:23:09,760
Let's see.

5589
06:23:19,950 --> 06:23:20,870
Wait.

5590
06:23:20,870 --> 06:23:27,310
I can't do it.

5591
06:23:34,750 --> 06:23:35,670
Wait.

5592
06:23:40,530 --> 06:23:42,070
This is...

5593
06:23:42,070 --> 06:23:43,110
Sad clown.

5594
06:23:43,210 --> 06:23:43,730
No, SK!

5595
06:23:44,090 --> 06:23:44,650
SK!

5596
06:23:44,650 --> 06:23:45,010
SK!

5597
06:23:45,010 --> 06:23:47,790
We got kicked out of the group and we didn't realize...

5598
06:23:47,790 --> 06:23:49,550
We didn't realize we're out of the group.

5599
06:23:52,440 --> 06:23:53,290
It's like trolls.

5600
06:23:53,870 --> 06:23:55,130
I lost my...

5601
06:23:55,130 --> 06:23:56,710
I lost my happy...

5602
06:23:56,710 --> 06:23:57,650
My happy...

5603
06:23:58,170 --> 06:23:58,810
Cause my...

5604
06:23:58,810 --> 06:24:01,810
My grandma died when I played Marvel.

5605
06:24:02,430 --> 06:24:03,730
Oh wait, that's fucked up.

5606
06:24:04,030 --> 06:24:05,350
No, I shouldn't say that.

5607
06:24:06,870 --> 06:24:08,490
I shouldn't say that.

5608
06:24:15,870 --> 06:24:17,410
Be inspired.

5609
06:24:17,970 --> 06:24:19,430
Sad hog.

5610
06:24:22,930 --> 06:24:24,190
Sad hog.

5611
06:24:29,020 --> 06:24:30,700
Who would help me?

5612
06:24:31,260 --> 06:24:31,600
Who?

5613
06:24:32,400 --> 06:24:34,600
Who would fucking help me?

5614
06:24:36,560 --> 06:24:38,440
Who would help me?

5615
06:24:43,680 --> 06:24:47,600
Who would help me in these sad times?

5616
06:24:50,760 --> 06:24:51,600
No!

5617
06:24:54,760 --> 06:24:57,960
Because Marvel Rivals killed my grandma.

5618
06:25:00,840 --> 06:25:06,460
I swear if A2938 is Calvin, I swear to God.

5619
06:25:06,600 --> 06:25:07,680
That's a Calvin username.

5620
06:25:08,420 --> 06:25:10,840
That's an aimbot Calvin username right there.

5621
06:25:14,920 --> 06:25:18,380
Because Marvel Rivals killed my grandma.

5622
06:25:26,360 --> 06:25:27,720
What the fuck?

5623
06:25:29,080 --> 06:25:30,400
What the fuck?

5624
06:25:31,260 --> 06:25:31,900
Wait.

5625
06:25:32,600 --> 06:25:34,000
What's going on?

5626
06:25:35,260 --> 06:25:36,420
Wait, what the fuck?

5627
06:25:38,460 --> 06:25:39,640
Wait, what?

5628
06:25:40,940 --> 06:25:42,320
What's going on with the ping?

5629
06:25:43,400 --> 06:25:45,020
Yeah, everybody's lagging.

5630
06:25:46,620 --> 06:25:48,080
Wait, this is everybody.

5631
06:25:48,540 --> 06:25:50,000
But we don't have the point!

5632
06:25:51,300 --> 06:25:51,920
Yeah, they are.

5633
06:25:54,700 --> 06:25:55,720
That's crazy.

5634
06:25:56,740 --> 06:25:58,740
Are we getting DDOSed?

5635
06:25:59,580 --> 06:26:02,020
We don't even have the point!

5636
06:26:05,560 --> 06:26:07,180
This is the clown suit.

5637
06:26:07,300 --> 06:26:08,020
This is why.

5638
06:26:10,560 --> 06:26:12,700
Oh my God, they're actually DDOSing.

5639
06:26:13,060 --> 06:26:15,600
They're DDOSing the servers?

5640
06:26:19,380 --> 06:26:21,200
They can't move!

5641
06:26:23,320 --> 06:26:24,700
This is not fair.

5642
06:26:25,720 --> 06:26:27,560
He can actually move!

5643
06:26:33,370 --> 06:26:35,530
This guy actually can move.

5644
06:26:35,770 --> 06:26:36,010
Look!

5645
06:26:36,770 --> 06:26:39,350
He can actually play the fucking game!

5646
06:26:47,040 --> 06:26:48,500
I don't fucking know.

5647
06:26:55,320 --> 06:26:57,740
Who's fucking DDOSing?

5648
06:27:13,500 --> 06:27:15,120
Oh my God!

5649
06:27:18,280 --> 06:27:18,920
I knew it.

5650
06:27:19,040 --> 06:27:19,680
I told you.

5651
06:27:20,620 --> 06:27:21,660
I told you.

5652
06:27:21,920 --> 06:27:23,880
Spider people, you can't trust them.

5653
06:27:24,420 --> 06:27:25,600
I fucking told you guys.

5654
06:27:25,700 --> 06:27:26,740
You guys didn't believe me.

5655
06:27:27,140 --> 06:27:27,320
J.

5656
06:27:27,340 --> 06:27:28,260
Jemison was right.

5657
06:27:28,620 --> 06:27:29,620
I watched his podcast.

5658
06:27:30,500 --> 06:27:31,060
He was right.

5659
06:27:31,560 --> 06:27:32,660
I fucking knew it.

5660
06:27:32,700 --> 06:27:34,060
Never trust a spider person.

5661
06:27:36,840 --> 06:27:38,720
I fucking told you guys.

5662
06:27:39,460 --> 06:27:42,900
I fucking told you guys to never trust a spider person.

5663
06:27:46,020 --> 06:27:47,940
Yeah, ping's back to normal.

5664
06:27:52,260 --> 06:27:53,480
That's so fucked.

5665
06:27:57,640 --> 06:27:59,180
For a rank up?

5666
06:28:01,020 --> 06:28:01,800
Maybe J.

5667
06:28:01,880 --> 06:28:01,940
J.

5668
06:28:02,020 --> 06:28:02,820
has a point.

5669
06:28:11,360 --> 06:28:12,720
This might be where we die.

5670
06:28:12,920 --> 06:28:13,620
Oh wait, nope.

5671
06:28:22,340 --> 06:28:23,000
Unless...

5672
06:28:23,000 --> 06:28:23,300
No!

5673
06:28:27,020 --> 06:28:27,680
Me!

5674
06:28:37,040 --> 06:28:37,600
Me!

5675
06:28:40,120 --> 06:28:40,300
Me!

5676
06:28:43,700 --> 06:28:44,980
Oh my God.

5677
06:28:46,060 --> 06:28:46,610
I mean...

5678
06:28:50,480 --> 06:28:51,800
We're undefeatable.

5679
06:29:00,000 --> 06:29:01,340
Oh my God.

5680
06:29:01,380 --> 06:29:02,200
Jump, we gotta jump.

5681
06:29:11,400 --> 06:29:12,740
Alright, be inspired.

5682
06:29:20,780 --> 06:29:21,980
I'm back.

5683
06:29:23,060 --> 06:29:24,780
I hear him.

5684
06:29:31,100 --> 06:29:31,620
Yeah.

5685
06:29:31,820 --> 06:29:34,920
Oh, I needed... I didn't sleep in time.

5686
06:29:39,100 --> 06:29:41,100
Oh no, he's gonna get the point back.

5687
06:29:42,020 --> 06:29:43,540
And he's gonna DDOS.

5688
06:29:48,440 --> 06:29:49,960
I thought it was my internet.

5689
06:29:50,400 --> 06:29:51,460
Alright, let's see.

5690
06:29:52,400 --> 06:29:53,220
The ping goes up.

5691
06:29:54,560 --> 06:29:55,300
Let's see.

5692
06:29:58,540 --> 06:30:00,680
Oh, ping is still fine.

5693
06:30:05,800 --> 06:30:07,340
Ping is still fine.

5694
06:30:08,800 --> 06:30:09,620
So far.

5695
06:30:23,780 --> 06:30:24,820
No, no.

5696
06:30:25,040 --> 06:30:25,760
Oh, thank God.

5697
06:30:26,020 --> 06:30:26,900
I'm sorry.

5698
06:30:26,900 --> 06:30:27,340
I'm sorry.

5699
06:30:29,500 --> 06:30:30,220
Oh fuck.

5700
06:30:30,720 --> 06:30:31,200
No!

5701
06:30:40,450 --> 06:30:41,750
He's gonna play legit.

5702
06:30:41,950 --> 06:30:43,230
Yeah, I think so too.

5703
06:30:43,730 --> 06:30:45,550
And then he's like, oh, I don't need a DDOS.

5704
06:30:45,690 --> 06:30:47,470
And then so he's playing legit now.

5705
06:30:47,890 --> 06:30:51,410
But like, they had such a huge ult advantage that like...

5706
06:30:52,190 --> 06:30:54,010
It like fucked over our economy.

5707
06:31:00,960 --> 06:31:03,560
Alright, do your thing!

5708
06:31:05,760 --> 06:31:06,540
Alright, goodbye.

5709
06:31:09,420 --> 06:31:10,520
Oh, you're lagged.

5710
06:31:22,960 --> 06:31:23,660
Alright.

5711
06:31:28,400 --> 06:31:29,100
Try.

5712
06:31:34,520 --> 06:31:35,220
Alright.

5713
06:31:41,420 --> 06:31:42,820
For

5714
06:31:46,300 --> 06:31:47,700
real.

5715
06:31:52,200 --> 06:31:54,260
I don't think we can kill him.

5716
06:31:58,520 --> 06:31:58,900
Alright.

5717
06:32:06,050 --> 06:32:07,130
Kill him!

5718
06:32:07,630 --> 06:32:09,950
How is he still alive?!

5719
06:32:25,960 --> 06:32:26,340
Okay.

5720
06:32:30,640 --> 06:32:30,860
Okay.

5721
06:32:50,760 --> 06:32:52,000
No!

5722
06:32:54,400 --> 06:32:56,600
Holy fucker!

5723
06:32:57,120 --> 06:32:59,040
Actual fucker!

5724
06:33:06,240 --> 06:33:08,280
Oh my God!

5725
06:33:09,080 --> 06:33:12,780
Oh my God, you actually...

5726
06:33:12,780 --> 06:33:13,920
Oh my God!

5727
06:33:14,820 --> 06:33:16,980
He almost got me!

5728
06:33:17,540 --> 06:33:18,640
He actually...

5729
06:33:18,640 --> 06:33:20,480
He almost got me!

5730
06:33:22,880 --> 06:33:25,480
Aww, don't talk too much shit, they're gonna do it.

5731
06:33:26,860 --> 06:33:27,860
Oh my God.

5732
06:33:29,580 --> 06:33:31,640
That's just crazy, I don't know how he was careful.

5733
06:33:31,940 --> 06:33:33,940
That's a different level of retarded though.

5734
06:33:35,960 --> 06:33:37,640
That was so scary.

5735
06:33:38,140 --> 06:33:39,880
That was so fucking scary.

5736
06:33:39,880 --> 06:33:40,920
Did I just buy way too much Luna?

5737
06:33:41,820 --> 06:33:42,840
Like, I can't.

5738
06:33:42,840 --> 06:33:44,200
I feel like I'm terrible on DDOS now.

5739
06:33:45,960 --> 06:33:46,660
It's alright, it's alright.

5740
06:33:48,000 --> 06:33:49,380
I almost have a...

5741
06:33:50,680 --> 06:33:51,080
Aww.

5742
06:33:54,880 --> 06:33:56,620
I almost have my ult too.

5743
06:34:01,740 --> 06:34:02,140
Alright.

5744
06:34:03,040 --> 06:34:04,420
It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

5745
06:34:04,600 --> 06:34:06,240
It'll be so fine, I feel so fine.

5746
06:34:06,760 --> 06:34:07,160
Yippee!

5747
06:34:07,780 --> 06:34:08,880
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

5748
06:34:10,620 --> 06:34:12,200
Oh, he's swinging his hammer, he's ready.

5749
06:34:12,760 --> 06:34:13,980
He feels so inspired.

5750
06:34:21,660 --> 06:34:22,020
Okay.

5751
06:34:22,080 --> 06:34:24,460
Okay, but you don't understand, we got DDOS.

5752
06:34:26,260 --> 06:34:26,980
Oh, whoops.

5753
06:34:27,560 --> 06:34:28,520
That's a little awkward.

5754
06:34:31,080 --> 06:34:32,320
We're a little stupid there.

5755
06:34:39,160 --> 06:34:39,520
Okay.

5756
06:34:44,840 --> 06:34:45,460
He's inspired.

5757
06:34:45,620 --> 06:34:46,400
Kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him!

5758
06:34:46,440 --> 06:34:46,860
Just kill him!

5759
06:34:47,400 --> 06:34:48,300
Kill him, kill him, kill him!

5760
06:34:48,380 --> 06:34:48,980
He's so low!

5761
06:34:50,980 --> 06:34:53,140
Oh, we used both support ults, so that's bad.

5762
06:34:58,060 --> 06:34:59,300
That's so bad.

5763
06:35:00,020 --> 06:35:01,860
We accidentally used both support ults.

5764
06:35:03,740 --> 06:35:05,360
I didn't think he was going to.

5765
06:35:09,880 --> 06:35:10,560
Oh,

5766
06:35:26,850 --> 06:35:26,970
what?

5767
06:35:29,190 --> 06:35:29,870
No!

5768
06:35:32,210 --> 06:35:33,590
I should've slept!

5769
06:35:36,390 --> 06:35:38,430
I should've slept, I forgot to sleep!

5770
06:35:38,450 --> 06:35:40,310
I forgot to sleep!

5771
06:35:41,150 --> 06:35:43,190
I need to remember my shift.

5772
06:35:44,090 --> 06:35:45,730
I was going to use Jetfall.

5773
06:35:49,270 --> 06:35:49,710
Goodbye.

5774
06:35:54,230 --> 06:35:58,030
No, he didn't.

5775
06:35:58,610 --> 06:35:59,590
He did not.

5776
06:36:00,190 --> 06:36:01,790
We got somebody else.

5777
06:36:17,140 --> 06:36:18,660
Yeah, I'm going to go up at the bottom.

5778
06:36:35,940 --> 06:36:37,680
Alright, hello time!

5779
06:36:39,100 --> 06:36:39,560
Whoa!

5780
06:36:42,280 --> 06:36:43,940
You can do that!

5781
06:36:47,300 --> 06:36:47,860
Oh,

5782
06:36:51,240 --> 06:36:56,820
I thought...

5783
06:37:00,690 --> 06:37:01,790
Guys, we need you!

5784
06:37:02,090 --> 06:37:02,770
Oh, shit!

5785
06:37:04,470 --> 06:37:05,930
Dude, Jesus fucking Christ.

5786
06:37:07,310 --> 06:37:09,590
Please, we need to kill something.

5787
06:37:20,170 --> 06:37:21,030
Please!

5788
06:37:21,910 --> 06:37:23,310
Kill something!

5789
06:37:30,180 --> 06:37:31,040
Please!

5790
06:37:40,120 --> 06:37:43,550
Oh my god, they got so much from that!

5791
06:37:46,390 --> 06:37:48,150
Bro, we need to just pick targets, bro.

5792
06:37:49,210 --> 06:37:50,890
Shooting at different people, that's why we're not...

5793
06:37:50,890 --> 06:37:51,930
That's why you guys aren't killing me.

5794
06:37:53,430 --> 06:37:53,770
That's it.

5795
06:38:20,420 --> 06:38:22,320
It's party time!

5796
06:38:22,980 --> 06:38:23,340
No!

5797
06:38:23,620 --> 06:38:24,200
Oh my god!

5798
06:38:29,030 --> 06:38:30,610
Alright, no!

5799
06:38:34,660 --> 06:38:36,140
That sucked.

5800
06:38:41,020 --> 06:38:43,140
I don't know if he'll live, but...

5801
06:38:47,980 --> 06:38:48,740
No,

5802
06:38:59,690 --> 06:39:00,890
I almost had it!

5803
06:39:01,350 --> 06:39:02,350
I almost won!

5804
06:39:04,750 --> 06:39:06,170
I literally won!

5805
06:39:06,170 --> 06:39:06,190
No!

5806
06:39:08,960 --> 06:39:11,790
I was dressed so hard to keep Gem up!

5807
06:39:14,840 --> 06:39:16,910
I just got it!

5808
06:39:17,530 --> 06:39:19,570
And we didn't get DDoSed.

5809
06:39:19,610 --> 06:39:21,710
We got DDoSed there.

5810
06:39:23,450 --> 06:39:26,290
The DDoS actually griefed us.

5811
06:39:30,070 --> 06:39:32,990
Yeah, they DDoSed us.

5812
06:39:36,730 --> 06:39:38,210
That's actually crazy.

5813
06:39:38,330 --> 06:39:40,570
I almost had more healing than the Luna?

5814
06:39:41,310 --> 06:39:43,230
That's fucking... okay.

5815
06:39:43,770 --> 06:39:44,950
That's sad.

5816
06:39:45,610 --> 06:39:46,750
That's sad.

5817
06:39:48,330 --> 06:39:48,970
That's...

5818
06:39:48,970 --> 06:39:50,630
That's so sad.

5819
06:39:51,730 --> 06:39:53,690
That's so sad.

5820
06:39:56,050 --> 06:39:58,970
How did I almost get more healing than the Luna?

5821
06:40:00,310 --> 06:40:02,170
Alright, I'm gonna request a join.

5822
06:40:05,070 --> 06:40:06,610
Wait, has she said anything?

5823
06:40:08,270 --> 06:40:09,230
Oh.

5824
06:40:10,530 --> 06:40:11,150
Okay.

5825
06:40:12,270 --> 06:40:12,630
Alright.

5826
06:40:14,310 --> 06:40:16,070
Did you at least win?

5827
06:40:18,130 --> 06:40:19,370
I...

5828
06:40:19,370 --> 06:40:20,510
No.

5829
06:40:21,270 --> 06:40:22,890
I got DDoSed.

5830
06:40:22,890 --> 06:40:24,270
Hold on!

5831
06:40:28,650 --> 06:40:34,490
Our entire team got DDoSed for them to win.

5832
06:40:37,410 --> 06:40:38,890
What are these games?

5833
06:40:39,770 --> 06:40:41,150
What are these games?

5834
06:40:41,530 --> 06:40:43,010
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

5835
06:41:49,000 --> 06:41:51,120
Ports, let's fucking go.

5836
06:41:56,820 --> 06:41:58,860
It's three support hours.

5837
06:42:00,380 --> 06:42:01,960
We're going back to GOATS.

5838
06:42:05,640 --> 06:42:07,340
We're going back to GOATS.

5839
06:42:13,320 --> 06:42:15,200
I believe in GOATS.

5840
06:42:16,240 --> 06:42:17,460
Oh, we're back to hell.

5841
06:42:22,420 --> 06:42:25,060
Don't want to let me off this well, guys.

5842
06:42:26,280 --> 06:42:27,160
Tomorrow...

5843
06:42:28,560 --> 06:42:29,440
Tomorrow...

5844
06:42:29,440 --> 06:42:31,500
It will be Marble Rivals.

5845
06:42:32,000 --> 06:42:33,140
End announcement.

5846
06:42:54,460 --> 06:42:58,440
This is what you wanted.

5847
06:42:59,600 --> 06:43:02,600
You cursed me to suffer like this.

5848
06:43:03,160 --> 06:43:03,880
How

5849
06:43:09,470 --> 06:43:10,970
did I die so fast?

5850
06:43:11,950 --> 06:43:12,650
Okay, I need to look.

5851
06:43:12,990 --> 06:43:13,990
What did he do?

5852
06:43:15,210 --> 06:43:16,230
He didn't...

5853
06:43:16,230 --> 06:43:17,850
Okay, okay.

5854
06:43:18,450 --> 06:43:20,270
Alright, I'm locked in.

5855
06:43:22,670 --> 06:43:24,070
I'm going back in.

5856
06:43:24,930 --> 06:43:26,830
I'm going back in, guys.

5857
06:43:34,520 --> 06:43:36,000
We're going back in.

5858
06:43:37,380 --> 06:43:37,960
There we go.

5859
06:43:39,920 --> 06:43:41,320
Locked in now again.

5860
06:43:43,440 --> 06:43:44,500
Random bullshit.

5861
06:43:44,660 --> 06:43:46,080
I fucking love random bullshit.

5862
06:43:46,860 --> 06:43:48,400
Wowee, there it is.

5863
06:43:48,620 --> 06:43:50,640
There's that random bullshit right there.

5864
06:43:53,380 --> 06:43:56,880
I should have started lowkey misplaying Mantis because I had such insane DPS.

5865
06:44:03,510 --> 06:44:04,410
It's fine.

5866
06:44:07,290 --> 06:44:08,670
Random bullshit time.

5867
06:44:14,400 --> 06:44:15,740
I'm going DPS too.

5868
06:44:16,080 --> 06:44:17,460
I want to DPS now too.

5869
06:44:17,760 --> 06:44:18,680
It's my turn.

5870
06:44:22,660 --> 06:44:24,260
It's my turn to DPS.

5871
06:44:24,420 --> 06:44:25,040
Oh, you got healed.

5872
06:44:25,120 --> 06:44:25,500
You got healed.

5873
06:44:26,040 --> 06:44:26,620
I healed you.

5874
06:44:31,450 --> 06:44:32,750
Oh, he... yeah.

5875
06:44:33,170 --> 06:44:33,530
Yeah.

5876
06:44:36,650 --> 06:44:37,490
It's fine.

5877
06:44:37,590 --> 06:44:38,050
We're fine.

5878
06:44:38,050 --> 06:44:40,290
Everything is A-okay.

5879
06:44:43,290 --> 06:44:44,470
Everything is okay.

5880
06:44:47,970 --> 06:44:49,370
Holy shit!

5881
06:44:51,050 --> 06:44:51,890
How did he die?

5882
06:44:51,970 --> 06:44:53,190
What the...

5883
06:44:53,190 --> 06:44:54,390
Okay, guys.

5884
06:44:54,490 --> 06:44:56,650
You guys gotta stop dying so fast, guys.

5885
06:44:58,410 --> 06:44:59,810
You guys...

5886
06:44:59,810 --> 06:45:01,770
Oh, okay.

5887
06:45:01,930 --> 06:45:02,630
Sure, we'll watch.

5888
06:45:03,970 --> 06:45:04,610
We're gonna watch.

5889
06:45:05,350 --> 06:45:06,070
Is she flying?

5890
06:45:11,740 --> 06:45:14,860
I'm not using my ult yet because I know...

5891
06:45:14,860 --> 06:45:18,040
Okay, maybe I don't need to use my ult yet.

5892
06:45:24,240 --> 06:45:25,800
Oh, okay.

5893
06:45:26,140 --> 06:45:27,640
I thought he'd live that.

5894
06:45:28,360 --> 06:45:29,540
But that's okay, guys.

5895
06:45:31,240 --> 06:45:32,300
That's fine.

5896
06:45:33,240 --> 06:45:34,260
That's fine.

5897
06:45:34,400 --> 06:45:36,100
We all... Oh, he used the I anyway.

5898
06:45:36,540 --> 06:45:37,640
So that's great.

5899
06:45:38,880 --> 06:45:40,080
That's great to know.

5900
06:45:40,260 --> 06:45:42,260
I was saving it up just for that.

5901
06:45:53,680 --> 06:45:54,940
Wait, what did they do?

5902
06:45:57,200 --> 06:45:57,740
Door, please.

5903
06:45:58,160 --> 06:45:59,200
Door, please!

5904
06:46:04,240 --> 06:46:04,680
Goodbye.

5905
06:46:07,900 --> 06:46:08,900
Hey, we did it!

5906
06:46:09,740 --> 06:46:10,700
We did it!

5907
06:46:15,680 --> 06:46:17,220
He did get all of us!

5908
06:46:19,360 --> 06:46:20,200
That's fine.

5909
06:46:21,540 --> 06:46:23,000
He didn't get all of us, so we're fine.

5910
06:46:25,560 --> 06:46:26,180
You know what?

5911
06:46:26,320 --> 06:46:28,260
I'm feeling a little wild next game.

5912
06:46:28,500 --> 06:46:29,140
You know what, guys?

5913
06:46:29,400 --> 06:46:30,540
Next game...

5914
06:46:31,540 --> 06:46:33,280
I'm gonna play Cloak and Dagger.

5915
06:46:33,840 --> 06:46:34,600
That's right.

5916
06:46:35,440 --> 06:46:37,860
I'm gonna show you guys I'm not a one trick anymore.

5917
06:46:38,580 --> 06:46:39,700
That's fucking right.

5918
06:46:41,320 --> 06:46:42,740
I'm fucking gonna do it.

5919
06:46:43,980 --> 06:46:45,660
Oh, I'm gonna go fucking wild.

5920
06:46:47,160 --> 06:46:48,940
I'm showing my character art.

5921
06:46:54,250 --> 06:46:54,730
Is that crazy?

5922
06:46:55,170 --> 06:46:56,410
Is that fucking wild?

5923
06:46:57,190 --> 06:46:58,590
It's almost like...

5924
06:46:58,590 --> 06:46:59,110
Oh my god.

5925
06:47:00,850 --> 06:47:02,150
Is that crazy?

5926
06:47:02,490 --> 06:47:05,910
If I'm gonna be at the circus, I'm gonna be the whole fucking circus.

5927
06:47:10,160 --> 06:47:11,160
I'm watching.

5928
06:47:18,260 --> 06:47:20,120
I might as well...

5929
06:47:22,160 --> 06:47:25,680
I might as well be the entire fucking circus.

5930
06:47:30,860 --> 06:47:32,560
Let's go!

5931
06:47:33,000 --> 06:47:34,800
Let's fucking fight!

5932
06:47:39,070 --> 06:47:41,430
Let's fucking fight!

5933
06:47:42,590 --> 06:47:44,530
Okay, he's...

5934
06:48:04,900 --> 06:48:08,320
I've been through so much.

5935
06:48:10,800 --> 06:48:12,720
I swear...

5936
06:48:12,720 --> 06:48:14,660
I've been through so much.

5937
06:48:14,940 --> 06:48:16,420
That's fucking right.

5938
06:48:19,200 --> 06:48:21,380
You gotta fucking clown on.

5939
06:48:22,720 --> 06:48:25,440
Get fucking clowned on.

5940
06:48:42,580 --> 06:48:45,040
Guys, if we can...

5941
06:48:46,520 --> 06:48:48,080
If we can...

5942
06:48:48,080 --> 06:48:49,720
If we can...

5943
06:48:49,720 --> 06:48:51,940
If we can break this...

5944
06:48:51,940 --> 06:48:53,740
Break this streak...

5945
06:48:53,740 --> 06:48:54,760
Things will be okay.

5946
06:48:56,460 --> 06:48:58,800
Things will be okay.

5947
06:48:59,940 --> 06:49:02,540
I'm playing so well.

5948
06:49:02,780 --> 06:49:04,520
Loki, you're playing so well.

5949
06:49:05,420 --> 06:49:06,480
It's not you.

5950
06:49:08,640 --> 06:49:10,060
Just break the cycle.

5951
06:49:12,800 --> 06:49:13,480
Just...

5952
06:49:13,480 --> 06:49:15,140
Break the cycle.

5953
06:49:15,740 --> 06:49:17,160
You can do it, Loki.

5954
06:49:18,120 --> 06:49:20,020
You can fucking do it.

5955
06:49:20,660 --> 06:49:22,580
Don't let them control you.

5956
06:49:24,020 --> 06:49:26,900
Don't let them do this to you.

5957
06:49:34,080 --> 06:49:35,400
I think I got a porta.

5958
06:49:39,900 --> 06:49:40,800
I need a porta.

5959
06:49:45,090 --> 06:49:46,310
What are you gonna do?

5960
06:49:46,310 --> 06:49:47,770
Oh, there they are.

5961
06:49:47,850 --> 06:49:48,850
Oh, they fucked up the porta.

5962
06:49:50,890 --> 06:49:52,870
They fucked up the porta.

5963
06:49:53,550 --> 06:49:54,750
Like, what's that?

5964
06:49:55,730 --> 06:49:56,790
Oh, there's the porta.

5965
06:50:01,230 --> 06:50:02,150
Oh, they...

5966
06:50:02,150 --> 06:50:03,390
Okay, you could've...

5967
06:50:03,390 --> 06:50:03,990
I don't know.

5968
06:50:05,630 --> 06:50:06,950
Like, looked at me?

5969
06:50:09,090 --> 06:50:09,690
Okay,

5970
06:50:12,850 --> 06:50:13,230
guys.

5971
06:50:32,980 --> 06:50:33,880
It's fine.

5972
06:50:37,520 --> 06:50:38,740
No way!

5973
06:50:40,040 --> 06:50:40,980
Get away!

5974
06:50:47,650 --> 06:50:48,150
Alright.

5975
06:50:49,430 --> 06:50:50,270
Goodbye.

5976
06:50:51,610 --> 06:50:52,570
Goodbye.

5977
06:50:53,910 --> 06:50:54,630
Oh, goodbye.

5978
06:50:56,370 --> 06:50:57,110
No.

5979
06:50:59,190 --> 06:51:00,430
It's okay.

5980
06:51:01,590 --> 06:51:03,070
I don't know how...

5981
06:51:03,070 --> 06:51:03,610
How...

5982
06:51:03,610 --> 06:51:04,550
Where do I go?

5983
06:51:09,460 --> 06:51:11,320
Oh, he's so low!

5984
06:51:19,660 --> 06:51:21,660
Oh, I thought he was gonna run to the left.

5985
06:51:22,700 --> 06:51:23,260
Kill him.

5986
06:51:24,280 --> 06:51:25,660
We don't need the Pope anymore.

5987
06:51:26,480 --> 06:51:28,520
But like, in the game, in game, in game, guys.

5988
06:51:28,660 --> 06:51:29,460
In game, in game.

5989
06:51:29,680 --> 06:51:30,320
In game.

5990
06:51:30,460 --> 06:51:31,920
I'm not opening that can of worms.

5991
06:51:32,360 --> 06:51:32,820
In game.

5992
06:51:35,280 --> 06:51:36,340
That was an accident.

5993
06:51:36,520 --> 06:51:37,400
I meant in game.

5994
06:51:38,940 --> 06:51:40,080
In Marble Rivals.

5995
06:51:41,480 --> 06:51:42,740
In Marble Rivals.

5996
06:51:52,000 --> 06:51:52,400
Woah.

5997
06:51:52,400 --> 06:51:55,920
But what if I don't want to go against the world?

5998
06:52:01,660 --> 06:52:03,500
Are we stopping them, guys?

5999
06:52:04,480 --> 06:52:04,860
Are we?

6000
06:52:05,500 --> 06:52:06,040
Are we?

6001
06:52:06,980 --> 06:52:07,420
Oh.

6002
06:52:09,860 --> 06:52:11,060
I don't know, guys.

6003
06:52:14,160 --> 06:52:15,500
Guys, are we stopping them?

6004
06:52:15,540 --> 06:52:16,320
I can't tell.

6005
06:52:20,880 --> 06:52:21,760
Guys, I...

6006
06:52:21,760 --> 06:52:22,120
Bro.

6007
06:52:22,660 --> 06:52:24,100
Bro, I don't think that's a good...

6008
06:52:24,100 --> 06:52:24,420
Bro.

6009
06:52:24,540 --> 06:52:25,380
Bro, get off the turret.

6010
06:52:30,290 --> 06:52:32,090
Oh, I froze her though.

6011
06:52:32,230 --> 06:52:32,830
Where am I?

6012
06:52:32,970 --> 06:52:33,270
No.

6013
06:52:33,690 --> 06:52:34,770
No, not the door.

6014
06:52:38,010 --> 06:52:39,870
No, I got stored!

6015
06:52:46,520 --> 06:52:48,020
No, I got stored!

6016
06:52:51,100 --> 06:52:52,080
Oh no.

6017
06:52:53,480 --> 06:52:54,240
Oh no.

6018
06:52:57,000 --> 06:52:57,640
Guys.

6019
06:52:58,480 --> 06:52:59,260
Beat me.

6020
06:53:02,960 --> 06:53:04,420
We can't stay together.

6021
06:53:07,260 --> 06:53:08,720
I got rid of the Ankh.

6022
06:53:10,840 --> 06:53:12,220
I'm gonna put down our tank now.

6023
06:53:18,020 --> 06:53:18,740
Oh, guys.

6024
06:53:18,920 --> 06:53:20,660
Guys, we gotta push up, guys.

6025
06:53:22,160 --> 06:53:25,140
Guys, all I'm saying is we really gotta push up.

6026
06:53:25,960 --> 06:53:27,940
Guys, there's a lot of free space.

6027
06:53:34,030 --> 06:53:34,550
Yes.

6028
06:53:35,190 --> 06:53:37,070
We gotta push up, guys.

6029
06:53:37,730 --> 06:53:40,830
That's a lot of free space we're giving them, guys.

6030
06:53:44,500 --> 06:53:47,660
Guys, if we push up just a little bit, guys.

6031
06:53:56,020 --> 06:53:56,540
Alright.

6032
06:53:57,680 --> 06:54:01,060
I guess I'm ready to put on the show.

6033
06:54:04,920 --> 06:54:05,560
Goodbye.

6034
06:54:07,920 --> 06:54:08,560
Goodbye.

6035
06:54:11,220 --> 06:54:12,360
Guys, we gotta go.

6036
06:54:12,840 --> 06:54:14,020
We gotta touch the cart.

6037
06:54:20,840 --> 06:54:21,380
Guys.

6038
06:54:22,100 --> 06:54:22,820
Guys, please.

6039
06:54:22,820 --> 06:54:23,440
Please.

6040
06:54:23,440 --> 06:54:26,000
Please, just hit me one time.

6041
06:54:29,430 --> 06:54:30,150
Guys.

6042
06:54:31,670 --> 06:54:33,090
Oh, thank god he copied Luna.

6043
06:54:40,550 --> 06:54:41,190
Okay.

6044
06:54:47,130 --> 06:54:48,190
That's fine.

6045
06:54:50,010 --> 06:54:51,750
Whoa, gotta stay away from that guy.

6046
06:55:09,700 --> 06:55:10,220
Oh no.

6047
06:55:11,260 --> 06:55:11,860
Oh no.

6048
06:55:12,800 --> 06:55:13,520
No.

6049
06:55:13,940 --> 06:55:14,400
No!

6050
06:55:14,840 --> 06:55:15,360
No!

6051
06:55:15,360 --> 06:55:15,620
No!

6052
06:55:15,940 --> 06:55:16,840
No!

6053
06:55:24,000 --> 06:55:26,960
Why is it me?

6054
06:55:28,360 --> 06:55:28,880
Stop.

6055
06:55:31,400 --> 06:55:32,560
Please.

6056
06:55:33,400 --> 06:55:35,200
I don't deserve this.

6057
06:55:38,760 --> 06:55:40,440
Oh my god.

6058
06:55:48,560 --> 06:55:50,080
I don't deserve this.

6059
06:55:51,120 --> 06:55:51,980
Legitimately.

6060
06:55:54,320 --> 06:55:55,860
I don't deserve it.

6061
06:55:56,940 --> 06:56:02,000
I don't deserve the hate crime that Jeff did to me.

6062
06:56:05,520 --> 06:56:08,220
Oh my god.

6063
06:56:10,140 --> 06:56:11,240
The curse.

6064
06:56:11,660 --> 06:56:14,800
The curse hits at a specific time.

6065
06:56:18,920 --> 06:56:20,800
That fucking shark.

6066
06:56:24,700 --> 06:56:26,340
That motherfucking shark.

6067
06:56:30,500 --> 06:56:32,040
Oh, I'm not a one trick.

6068
06:56:32,140 --> 06:56:32,820
I'll show you.

6069
06:56:33,160 --> 06:56:34,700
I'll fucking show you all.

6070
06:56:34,820 --> 06:56:35,380
Okay, we can't.

6071
06:56:35,400 --> 06:56:36,520
We actually need Luna though.

6072
06:56:36,920 --> 06:56:37,440
We actually...

6073
06:56:38,300 --> 06:56:39,340
I can't.

6074
06:56:39,720 --> 06:56:41,400
We actually need Luna.

6075
06:56:48,330 --> 06:56:50,230
How did it get this bad?

6076
06:56:50,230 --> 06:56:52,850
How did it get this bad?

6077
06:56:53,590 --> 06:56:55,230
The Gatsby curse.

6078
06:57:01,610 --> 06:57:02,810
We should've...

6079
06:57:02,810 --> 06:57:04,590
I'm gonna put on our tank.

6080
06:57:04,730 --> 06:57:06,350
I think our tank really needs it more.

6081
06:57:14,330 --> 06:57:16,270
Like, I legitimately think that...

6082
06:57:16,810 --> 06:57:17,110
Yeah.

6083
06:57:17,630 --> 06:57:18,270
Our tank...

6084
06:57:18,870 --> 06:57:19,890
Cannot sustain.

6085
06:57:24,020 --> 06:57:26,020
I would love to, but...

6086
06:57:28,220 --> 06:57:29,800
Legitimately, we need it on a tank.

6087
06:57:41,530 --> 06:57:41,930
Okay.

6088
06:57:42,710 --> 06:57:44,250
I'm so scared of getting...

6089
06:57:44,250 --> 06:57:44,790
Hit me once.

6090
06:57:44,870 --> 06:57:45,530
Hit me once, please.

6091
06:57:46,170 --> 06:57:47,250
Please heal me once.

6092
06:57:47,270 --> 06:57:47,930
That's all you need.

6093
06:58:01,720 --> 06:58:02,120
Okay.

6094
06:58:02,320 --> 06:58:02,940
I'm trying.

6095
06:58:13,330 --> 06:58:13,730
Reload.

6096
06:58:13,870 --> 06:58:14,630
No, no, no, no, no.

6097
06:58:14,630 --> 06:58:14,830
Reload.

6098
06:58:21,170 --> 06:58:22,010
Oh, they dropped down.

6099
06:58:22,030 --> 06:58:22,330
I'm sorry.

6100
06:58:35,880 --> 06:58:36,540
Oh my god.

6101
06:58:39,740 --> 06:58:40,420
No!

6102
06:58:49,050 --> 06:58:51,930
Use all the random bullshit you can find.

6103
06:59:05,070 --> 06:59:05,930
Oh no.

6104
06:59:06,350 --> 06:59:06,830
Yes!

6105
06:59:07,350 --> 06:59:08,290
Oh my god.

6106
06:59:08,450 --> 06:59:09,070
I think I...

6107
06:59:09,070 --> 06:59:10,550
I think I clutched that.

6108
06:59:10,910 --> 06:59:13,190
I legitimately clutched that so hard.

6109
06:59:15,910 --> 06:59:16,770
Oh my god.

6110
06:59:16,890 --> 06:59:18,670
I clutched it so hard.

6111
06:59:21,530 --> 06:59:23,070
Oh my god.

6112
06:59:23,330 --> 06:59:23,810
Thank god.

6113
06:59:24,510 --> 06:59:27,050
I had to work so hard for that.

6114
06:59:27,470 --> 06:59:29,470
I had to work so hard.

6115
06:59:33,930 --> 06:59:36,210
I need something sadder.

6116
06:59:37,090 --> 06:59:39,390
I need sadder music, guys.

6117
06:59:40,050 --> 06:59:40,610
I can't.

6118
06:59:40,650 --> 06:59:42,070
I'm not sad enough.

6119
06:59:42,330 --> 06:59:45,570
I need sadder music.

6120
06:59:49,920 --> 06:59:50,400
Yeah, yeah.

6121
06:59:56,760 --> 06:59:58,040
Here we go.

6122
07:00:16,360 --> 07:00:19,460
This is how I feel inside.

6123
07:00:20,940 --> 07:00:21,680
Boom.

6124
07:00:22,180 --> 07:00:22,520
Boom.

6125
07:00:22,980 --> 07:00:23,580
Boom.

6126
07:00:24,120 --> 07:00:24,600
Boom.

6127
07:00:25,120 --> 07:00:25,500
Boom.

6128
07:00:26,160 --> 07:00:26,620
Boom.

6129
07:00:28,020 --> 07:00:28,540
Boom.

6130
07:00:29,300 --> 07:00:29,400
Boom.

6131
07:00:34,300 --> 07:00:35,440
Boom.

6132
07:00:36,320 --> 07:00:37,460
Boom.

6133
07:00:38,540 --> 07:00:39,680
Boom.

6134
07:00:43,560 --> 07:00:44,400
Boom.

6135
07:00:48,240 --> 07:00:48,580
Boom.

6136
07:00:49,060 --> 07:00:49,140
Boom.

6137
07:00:50,020 --> 07:00:50,600
Boom.

6138
07:00:50,720 --> 07:00:51,720
Boom.

6139
07:00:51,840 --> 07:00:52,040
Boom.

6140
07:00:54,180 --> 07:00:54,740
Boom.

6141
07:00:54,740 --> 07:00:55,480
Boom.

6142
07:00:56,960 --> 07:00:57,140
Boom.

6143
07:00:57,960 --> 07:00:58,200
Boom.

6144
07:00:58,420 --> 07:00:58,660
Boom.

6145
07:00:58,660 --> 07:00:59,120
Boom.

6146
07:01:02,680 --> 07:01:03,140
Boom.

6147
07:01:05,560 --> 07:01:07,760
Oh my god, I've got fucked over there.

6148
07:01:07,840 --> 07:01:08,980
He just walked up.

6149
07:01:09,140 --> 07:01:10,560
They can do that?

6150
07:01:10,700 --> 07:01:14,620
He just walked up!

6151
07:01:18,680 --> 07:01:19,780
Don't worry, I'm here.

6152
07:01:20,900 --> 07:01:21,520
I'm here.

6153
07:01:22,600 --> 07:01:23,440
I'm coming over.

6154
07:01:23,560 --> 07:01:24,300
I'm coming over.

6155
07:01:25,460 --> 07:01:26,800
Oh, they went off point.

6156
07:01:26,880 --> 07:01:27,280
Let's go.

6157
07:01:28,100 --> 07:01:29,640
HAHAHAHA YAY

6158
07:01:34,300 --> 07:01:36,020
They went off point.

6159
07:01:37,060 --> 07:01:39,120
This is... I need something.

6160
07:01:39,880 --> 07:01:41,600
I need something sadder.

6161
07:01:43,740 --> 07:01:45,880
I need something even sadder.

6162
07:01:52,680 --> 07:01:55,960
Yay, I need something even sadder.

6163
07:02:00,120 --> 07:02:01,500
No, that's happy.

6164
07:02:01,620 --> 07:02:02,240
Wait, what the fuck?

6165
07:02:02,280 --> 07:02:03,180
That's not sad.

6166
07:02:04,100 --> 07:02:05,540
Sad music.

6167
07:02:06,400 --> 07:02:07,740
Very emotional.

6168
07:02:08,800 --> 07:02:09,700
Oh, that's...

6169
07:02:11,220 --> 07:02:12,380
I like that.

6170
07:02:49,960 --> 07:02:51,220
I feel it.

6171
07:02:55,480 --> 07:02:56,380
It's too quiet?

6172
07:02:56,540 --> 07:02:57,060
Don't worry.

6173
07:02:59,080 --> 07:03:00,160
It's a sad flute.

6174
07:03:01,800 --> 07:03:03,660
It's a very sad flute.

6175
07:03:04,800 --> 07:03:06,500
You go there, flute man.

6176
07:03:07,860 --> 07:03:10,500
Say my emotions for me, flute man.

6177
07:03:10,760 --> 07:03:12,480
Tell the world how I feel.

6178
07:03:36,950 --> 07:03:38,330
I feel like...

6179
07:03:39,010 --> 07:03:40,550
I'm like staring out.

6180
07:03:41,190 --> 07:03:44,650
I'm telling you how Marvel Rivals killed my grandma.

6181
07:03:45,410 --> 07:03:47,470
This is a very emotional for me.

6182
07:03:48,590 --> 07:03:49,490
I'm just...

6183
07:03:52,550 --> 07:03:57,370
I'll show you how it's... I'll show you how I'm not a one trick.

6184
07:03:58,010 --> 07:03:59,250
That's right.

6185
07:03:59,910 --> 07:04:01,490
It's time.

6186
07:04:06,630 --> 07:04:07,430
It's time.

6187
07:04:07,590 --> 07:04:08,750
Okay, I need something more inspirational.

6188
07:04:08,950 --> 07:04:10,130
All right, here.

6189
07:04:23,680 --> 07:04:24,480
It's time.

6190
07:04:25,160 --> 07:04:27,240
No, I'm a three trick now.

6191
07:04:33,250 --> 07:04:35,130
Also, if we lose this, I'm swapping to Luna.

6192
07:04:50,950 --> 07:04:53,110
Bom bom bom bom.

6193
07:04:56,670 --> 07:04:59,230
Guys, it's okay.

6194
07:04:59,310 --> 07:05:03,450
Tomorrow, it's sure for... it's just sure for duo tomorrow.

6195
07:05:05,610 --> 07:05:07,590
Things will be okay.

6196
07:05:07,970 --> 07:05:12,430
Things will be okay.

6197
07:05:24,750 --> 07:05:26,610
Guys, I need you guys to peek me.

6198
07:05:26,610 --> 07:05:27,810
You guys can help me.

6199
07:05:40,090 --> 07:05:41,410
Bom bom.

6200
07:05:41,990 --> 07:05:43,170
Right on.

6201
07:05:46,270 --> 07:05:47,910
Bom, bom.

6202
07:05:51,900 --> 07:05:53,280
Bom bom.

6203
07:05:54,020 --> 07:05:55,040
Bom bom.

6204
07:05:56,200 --> 07:05:56,940
Bom bom.

6205
07:05:58,040 --> 07:05:58,960
Bom bom.

6206
07:05:59,240 --> 07:05:59,800
Bom bom.

6207
07:06:00,000 --> 07:06:00,380
Bom bom.

6208
07:06:01,380 --> 07:06:02,400
Bom bom.

6209
07:06:02,400 --> 07:06:04,320
Bom bom.

6210
07:06:04,720 --> 07:06:05,300
Bom bom.

6211
07:06:05,780 --> 07:06:06,420
Bom bom.

6212
07:06:08,060 --> 07:06:08,600
Bom.

6213
07:06:10,780 --> 07:06:11,340
Bom.

6214
07:06:12,660 --> 07:06:13,160
Bom.

6215
07:06:14,120 --> 07:06:15,220
No, no, no.

6216
07:06:15,220 --> 07:06:15,500
No!

6217
07:06:15,740 --> 07:06:16,940
I couldn't get out!

6218
07:06:17,080 --> 07:06:17,580
Fuck!

6219
07:06:19,100 --> 07:06:20,180
Oh my god.

6220
07:06:21,160 --> 07:06:21,900
It's fine.

6221
07:06:22,200 --> 07:06:23,140
You don't need me there.

6222
07:06:24,840 --> 07:06:25,980
You don't need me.

6223
07:06:26,080 --> 07:06:26,740
Oh, fuck.

6224
07:06:26,820 --> 07:06:28,080
Okay, you might need me now.

6225
07:06:29,080 --> 07:06:29,640
Bom.

6226
07:06:29,640 --> 07:06:31,280
Bom.

6227
07:06:32,400 --> 07:06:33,800
Bom.

6228
07:06:34,440 --> 07:06:34,540
Bom.

6229
07:06:34,740 --> 07:06:49,500
Bom bom badowm badowm.

6230
07:06:50,500 --> 07:06:51,320
Badum

6231
07:06:55,690 --> 07:07:11,490
Bum bum badum badadum Bum bum Bum Bum bum badum Bum bum Bum bum Bum

6232
07:07:19,740 --> 07:07:24,580
Bum bum Bum bum bum Badum

6233
07:07:57,340 --> 07:07:58,900
I'm not a one trick!

6234
07:08:01,920 --> 07:08:04,800
Bum ba dum bum ba dum...

6235
07:08:04,800 --> 07:08:07,240
I told you.

6236
07:08:07,500 --> 07:08:09,820
I told you I can play other support.

6237
07:08:13,260 --> 07:08:14,720
I fucking told you.

6238
07:08:15,320 --> 07:08:16,560
I learned.

6239
07:08:16,980 --> 07:08:18,920
I learned other support.

6240
07:08:26,970 --> 07:08:28,170
I told you.

6241
07:08:28,510 --> 07:08:31,430
I told you I know how to play other supports, guys.

6242
07:08:31,710 --> 07:08:33,290
I fucking told you.

6243
07:08:37,200 --> 07:08:38,840
Wow, that hurt.

6244
07:08:43,450 --> 07:08:44,250
That's fine.

6245
07:08:47,390 --> 07:08:49,190
Okay, no, I'm not playing Loki.

6246
07:08:49,290 --> 07:08:50,050
I don't like Loki.

6247
07:08:50,070 --> 07:08:51,270
I don't like playing Loki anymore.

6248
07:08:52,170 --> 07:08:53,670
He's like really situational.

6249
07:08:59,270 --> 07:09:00,450
He's doing it his way!

6250
07:09:01,590 --> 07:09:02,650
He's doing it his way!

6251
07:09:05,050 --> 07:09:07,550
That's right, that's right.

6252
07:09:10,330 --> 07:09:11,770
That's fucking right.

6253
07:09:17,290 --> 07:09:18,890
This is it.

6254
07:09:22,270 --> 07:09:27,590
I'm showing my chat that I'm no longer a one-trick.

6255
07:09:30,010 --> 07:09:32,230
That I have variety.

6256
07:09:37,870 --> 07:09:40,710
I'm no longer a one-trick.

6257
07:09:42,950 --> 07:09:47,510
I can play other characters.

6258
07:09:54,230 --> 07:09:56,970
I can do other things now.

6259
07:09:58,590 --> 07:10:00,330
I'm a three-trick now.

6260
07:10:01,970 --> 07:10:06,750
I can play different support, determine with the situation.

6261
07:10:08,370 --> 07:10:09,590
This would be key.

6262
07:10:10,710 --> 07:10:13,250
But Luna is like my auto-pick.

6263
07:10:17,640 --> 07:10:20,820
She is my... she's my first pick.

6264
07:10:21,920 --> 07:10:23,560
I am a three-trick now.

6265
07:10:23,980 --> 07:10:24,880
A three-trick pony.

6266
07:10:32,720 --> 07:10:34,800
Okay, nice.

6267
07:10:34,880 --> 07:10:36,900
I was worried that... alright.

6268
07:10:39,460 --> 07:10:42,480
Character development and also she looks great.

6269
07:10:58,840 --> 07:11:00,380
Whoa, what do we do?

6270
07:11:06,760 --> 07:11:08,500
Okay, the turrets gone guys.

6271
07:11:08,940 --> 07:11:11,920
I'm like a little worried with what we're supposed to do here.

6272
07:11:25,540 --> 07:11:28,040
I made it so you can fight in there!

6273
07:11:31,220 --> 07:11:32,280
That's looking right.

6274
07:11:34,360 --> 07:11:35,540
There we go.

6275
07:11:36,300 --> 07:11:37,580
There we go!

6276
07:11:40,980 --> 07:11:41,900
I told you.

6277
07:11:42,760 --> 07:11:45,880
I told you I could fucking do it.

6278
07:11:47,720 --> 07:11:51,080
None of you... you guys didn't believe me.

6279
07:11:51,540 --> 07:11:53,220
You guys thought I was throwing!

6280
07:11:54,560 --> 07:11:58,080
I told you I can... I can play Cloak and Dagger now.

6281
07:11:59,120 --> 07:12:01,200
I fucking told you!

6282
07:12:01,740 --> 07:12:05,080
If we win this, I'm done for the day.

6283
07:12:05,900 --> 07:12:07,640
I'm back to Diamond.

6284
07:12:08,260 --> 07:12:10,680
I will be back to Diamond.

6285
07:12:11,980 --> 07:12:13,800
For the next game.

6286
07:12:14,680 --> 07:12:16,440
And then I call it.

6287
07:12:18,220 --> 07:12:23,200
But if no Diamond, I continue my... my circus.

6288
07:12:32,140 --> 07:12:36,680
And then tomorrow is another day.

6289
07:12:38,640 --> 07:12:39,180
Tomorrow.

6290
07:12:41,100 --> 07:12:42,040
All right.

6291
07:12:42,600 --> 07:12:44,760
We call for comms.

6292
07:12:45,600 --> 07:12:46,440
Okay, wait.

6293
07:12:46,780 --> 07:12:47,740
No, that's not what I wanted.

6294
07:12:48,660 --> 07:12:49,640
I call escape.

6295
07:12:50,100 --> 07:12:50,920
It's time.

6296
07:12:58,840 --> 07:13:00,060
It's time.

6297
07:13:00,760 --> 07:13:01,280
Hello?

6298
07:13:02,820 --> 07:13:03,200
Hello?

6299
07:13:03,840 --> 07:13:05,820
I'm calling for the comms.

6300
07:13:06,820 --> 07:13:08,580
We are gonna win.

6301
07:13:09,680 --> 07:13:12,820
The Doki Bird voice, I haven't heard in so long.

6302
07:13:12,860 --> 07:13:14,320
I'm calling for the comms.

6303
07:13:18,620 --> 07:13:20,500
All right, all right.

6304
07:13:21,100 --> 07:13:25,920
Mordred was so sad early when he was playing Mantis, because y'all would ult at the same time every time.

6305
07:13:26,340 --> 07:13:29,740
Yeah, yeah, like we both had the same idea!

6306
07:13:33,280 --> 07:13:34,960
We had the same idea.

6307
07:13:35,780 --> 07:13:38,180
But there was no saving for this team.

6308
07:13:38,400 --> 07:13:40,740
There was no saving though at that point.

6309
07:13:41,100 --> 07:13:45,240
I think... I think... I think at that time the team was GG's.

6310
07:13:45,240 --> 07:13:45,840
It was cooked.

6311
07:13:46,500 --> 07:13:47,400
It was Jover.

6312
07:13:48,500 --> 07:13:49,340
It's okay.

6313
07:13:49,680 --> 07:13:50,880
We got to win this.

6314
07:13:51,000 --> 07:13:52,080
So we can both go to sleep.

6315
07:13:52,280 --> 07:13:54,160
And then we go again tomorrow.

6316
07:13:55,200 --> 07:13:57,880
We go again tomorrow.

6317
07:13:59,000 --> 07:13:59,560
I'm down.

6318
07:14:00,020 --> 07:14:00,840
Let's go!

6319
07:14:01,400 --> 07:14:02,240
I'm streaming at 630.

6320
07:14:02,240 --> 07:14:03,120
I'm playing with them.

6321
07:14:03,760 --> 07:14:06,100
Oh, I think I'm playing with Brian late night.

6322
07:14:06,540 --> 07:14:07,260
If you want to come.

6323
07:14:07,700 --> 07:14:09,460
Wait, does he have rank?

6324
07:14:10,380 --> 07:14:10,740
No.

6325
07:14:11,940 --> 07:14:13,420
He's gonna be really bad.

6326
07:14:13,420 --> 07:14:15,000
Okay, I guess we don't go.

6327
07:14:16,100 --> 07:14:18,500
We'll probably have a few hours before he gets on.

6328
07:14:18,900 --> 07:14:19,640
Okay, okay.

6329
07:14:20,520 --> 07:14:21,520
No, I'm playing at 630.

6330
07:14:21,640 --> 07:14:22,780
It's like super late.

6331
07:14:23,300 --> 07:14:25,100
Because that's my PSC.

6332
07:14:25,780 --> 07:14:27,560
Oh, that is super late.

6333
07:14:27,860 --> 07:14:29,220
Yeah, probably no time.

6334
07:14:30,820 --> 07:14:31,800
But the day after.

6335
07:14:32,440 --> 07:14:34,200
That guy did not get off his turret.

6336
07:14:35,920 --> 07:14:37,700
I don't know what to do with him.

6337
07:14:43,420 --> 07:14:43,940
Oh.

6338
07:14:45,140 --> 07:14:46,520
I'm not looking good.

6339
07:14:47,880 --> 07:14:48,280
Um.

6340
07:14:49,660 --> 07:14:49,980
Um.

6341
07:14:51,400 --> 07:14:52,520
This is salvageable.

6342
07:14:54,880 --> 07:14:55,880
I'll touch.

6343
07:14:57,740 --> 07:14:58,320
Okay, I'm out.

6344
07:15:00,680 --> 07:15:01,320
Um.

6345
07:15:01,520 --> 07:15:02,060
He dead.

6346
07:15:03,660 --> 07:15:04,760
You have one tank?

6347
07:15:04,880 --> 07:15:05,780
Oh, you do.

6348
07:15:05,960 --> 07:15:06,760
And they have two.

6349
07:15:07,260 --> 07:15:08,340
That makes more sense.

6350
07:15:09,040 --> 07:15:10,620
It's okay, tanks are overrated.

6351
07:15:10,960 --> 07:15:11,500
That's true.

6352
07:15:14,060 --> 07:15:15,600
Peek me so I can give you an orb.

6353
07:15:17,440 --> 07:15:18,640
I got you, you have an orb now.

6354
07:15:19,340 --> 07:15:19,980
Thank you.

6355
07:15:26,430 --> 07:15:27,310
This guy.

6356
07:15:28,530 --> 07:15:29,210
You're so healthy.

6357
07:15:29,570 --> 07:15:30,870
You're so healthy right now.

6358
07:15:31,330 --> 07:15:32,650
I'm extremely healthy.

6359
07:15:32,870 --> 07:15:34,310
You're so healthy, but we lost our other support.

6360
07:15:34,310 --> 07:15:35,310
I exercise every day.

6361
07:15:36,750 --> 07:15:38,090
You're so healthy still.

6362
07:15:38,730 --> 07:15:38,950
Oh.

6363
07:15:41,130 --> 07:15:42,590
You're just non-stop getting healed.

6364
07:15:42,590 --> 07:15:45,310
I'm just healing the Hella.

6365
07:15:45,610 --> 07:15:46,650
You're the best.

6366
07:15:47,170 --> 07:15:48,790
Because all she does is feed.

6367
07:15:51,410 --> 07:15:53,050
You're so very healthy.

6368
07:15:53,610 --> 07:15:54,670
The Hella is still feeding.

6369
07:15:57,230 --> 07:15:58,750
See, it's fine.

6370
07:15:59,830 --> 07:16:00,510
It's fine.

6371
07:16:00,810 --> 07:16:01,530
It's fine.

6372
07:16:02,350 --> 07:16:04,330
I got logged.

6373
07:16:05,370 --> 07:16:07,850
Where did you shoot me from?

6374
07:16:10,570 --> 07:16:11,330
What?

6375
07:16:12,150 --> 07:16:13,550
I'm making a comeback.

6376
07:16:13,870 --> 07:16:14,530
Okay, I'm coming back.

6377
07:16:15,710 --> 07:16:16,390
Hanzo moment.

6378
07:16:18,030 --> 07:16:20,050
We are undefeatable!

6379
07:16:20,590 --> 07:16:21,650
Uh oh, he never misses.

6380
07:16:22,790 --> 07:16:24,010
And they're undefeatable.

6381
07:16:24,570 --> 07:16:25,670
How do you beat that?

6382
07:16:26,890 --> 07:16:29,490
This Hawkeye is really good.

6383
07:16:32,230 --> 07:16:34,850
Oh, that's the guy that I said no to stacking with.

6384
07:16:35,490 --> 07:16:36,350
Sorry, guy.

6385
07:16:37,690 --> 07:16:38,290
Oh.

6386
07:16:38,950 --> 07:16:39,470
Oh.

6387
07:16:39,850 --> 07:16:42,370
At the end of the game, he was like, anyone want to stack?

6388
07:16:42,510 --> 07:16:43,630
And then all of us said no.

6389
07:16:44,670 --> 07:16:45,190
Oh.

6390
07:16:46,010 --> 07:16:47,110
We should stack with him.

6391
07:16:48,350 --> 07:16:49,990
I'm making a comeback.

6392
07:16:52,090 --> 07:16:54,070
He's just having a lucky first round.

6393
07:16:54,610 --> 07:16:54,910
Yeah?

6394
07:16:55,950 --> 07:16:56,470
Yeah.

6395
07:16:58,230 --> 07:16:59,570
I don't know.

6396
07:16:59,870 --> 07:17:01,810
He's killing a lot of people.

6397
07:17:02,770 --> 07:17:03,530
That is true.

6398
07:17:07,590 --> 07:17:08,110
Oh.

6399
07:17:09,270 --> 07:17:10,450
He don't have an orb.

6400
07:17:10,550 --> 07:17:11,690
Yeah, lucky first round health pack.

6401
07:17:13,230 --> 07:17:14,750
Wait, I thought there was one there.

6402
07:17:15,050 --> 07:17:15,850
Oh, crap.

6403
07:17:19,970 --> 07:17:21,610
Oh, he's not okay.

6404
07:17:22,210 --> 07:17:22,810
Uh oh.

6405
07:17:23,310 --> 07:17:24,890
Our team is not okay right now.

6406
07:17:26,050 --> 07:17:27,350
Yeah, this is not looking good.

6407
07:17:28,530 --> 07:17:30,070
Not looking very inspiring.

6408
07:17:30,070 --> 07:17:30,670
I'm almost here with my ultimate ability.

6409
07:17:31,850 --> 07:17:33,010
I will inspire.

6410
07:17:33,530 --> 07:17:36,130
I'll inspire our team with a motivational speech.

6411
07:17:36,150 --> 07:17:36,850
Hang on.

6412
07:17:37,230 --> 07:17:38,810
We got this, guys.

6413
07:17:40,710 --> 07:17:41,710
Are you inspired?

6414
07:17:42,410 --> 07:17:44,670
I don't think that inspires anybody.

6415
07:17:47,790 --> 07:17:48,670
Fire, please.

6416
07:17:53,530 --> 07:17:55,730
Oh, by the way, you never had an orb, so you might die.

6417
07:17:55,850 --> 07:17:57,790
Oh, unless...

6418
07:17:57,790 --> 07:17:58,350
Oh my goodness.

6419
07:17:58,630 --> 07:17:59,030
You're fine.

6420
07:17:59,210 --> 07:17:59,770
You're not fine.

6421
07:18:00,170 --> 07:18:00,690
You're fine.

6422
07:18:00,790 --> 07:18:01,330
I'm so fine.

6423
07:18:01,650 --> 07:18:02,210
Everything's fine.

6424
07:18:03,510 --> 07:18:05,750
Everything's awesome and cool when you're part of a team.

6425
07:18:06,590 --> 07:18:08,250
They're gonna Magneto, I think.

6426
07:18:10,050 --> 07:18:10,710
Yeah, they do.

6427
07:18:13,050 --> 07:18:14,790
There it is.

6428
07:18:18,430 --> 07:18:20,090
Oh, Jesus.

6429
07:18:21,550 --> 07:18:22,920
Oh, you got...

6430
07:18:23,550 --> 07:18:26,310
He freaking buckied me out of my dash.

6431
07:18:27,830 --> 07:18:28,290
Yeah.

6432
07:18:29,690 --> 07:18:30,390
Oh.

6433
07:18:30,390 --> 07:18:30,810
Oh.

6434
07:18:33,130 --> 07:18:35,310
I'm not feeling inspired anymore.

6435
07:18:36,190 --> 07:18:36,850
I don't know.

6436
07:18:37,950 --> 07:18:39,270
You need another motivational speech?

6437
07:18:39,330 --> 07:18:40,770
I don't think...

6438
07:18:40,770 --> 07:18:42,490
I'm not...

6439
07:18:42,490 --> 07:18:42,730
Oh.

6440
07:18:44,410 --> 07:18:44,970
Oh.

6441
07:18:46,650 --> 07:18:46,930
Oh.

6442
07:18:47,750 --> 07:18:48,070
Oh.

6443
07:18:50,270 --> 07:18:53,950
One last game and going to sleep was too good to be true anyways.

6444
07:18:54,350 --> 07:18:54,910
It was...

6445
07:18:58,350 --> 07:18:58,910
Oh.

6446
07:19:00,030 --> 07:19:02,830
There's much more suffering to be had.

6447
07:19:09,650 --> 07:19:11,350
Who gave him again?

6448
07:19:11,650 --> 07:19:12,510
Who was it?

6449
07:19:16,410 --> 07:19:17,430
Eski, I don't...

6450
07:19:19,470 --> 07:19:21,910
I don't think we're gonna win this one.

6451
07:19:22,890 --> 07:19:23,390
Nah, nah, nah.

6452
07:19:24,030 --> 07:19:24,790
We got this.

6453
07:19:26,210 --> 07:19:27,330
I don't think...

6454
07:19:29,750 --> 07:19:32,130
I don't see a world in which we lose this.

6455
07:19:33,250 --> 07:19:35,150
Really, I see multiple worlds.

6456
07:19:35,310 --> 07:19:35,950
I think us...

6457
07:19:37,570 --> 07:19:38,610
winning this...

6458
07:19:38,610 --> 07:19:39,830
is like...

6459
07:19:39,830 --> 07:19:41,590
the 0.1% chance.

6460
07:19:44,790 --> 07:19:47,050
I like how he's like...

6461
07:19:47,050 --> 07:19:47,870
do you tank?

6462
07:19:48,010 --> 07:19:49,850
And then they swap to Adam.

6463
07:19:53,510 --> 07:19:54,030
Like...

6464
07:19:55,570 --> 07:19:56,410
Oh, there we go.

6465
07:19:56,710 --> 07:19:58,590
You're not ready for the SK Luna snow.

6466
07:19:58,710 --> 07:19:59,990
Oh my god.

6467
07:20:00,270 --> 07:20:02,550
Although I was the only DPS doing anything.

6468
07:20:02,710 --> 07:20:03,690
So we'll see how this goes.

6469
07:20:04,490 --> 07:20:06,090
Yeah, that's...

6470
07:20:06,090 --> 07:20:06,690
Yeah.

6471
07:20:08,310 --> 07:20:09,910
I feel like...

6472
07:20:09,910 --> 07:20:10,650
Who do we avoid?

6473
07:20:12,610 --> 07:20:13,850
I don't even know.

6474
07:20:13,970 --> 07:20:16,650
Because Nyan Cat Balling was popping off the last couple rounds.

6475
07:20:16,990 --> 07:20:17,430
Maybe...

6476
07:20:19,050 --> 07:20:20,010
It's their round.

6477
07:20:20,270 --> 07:20:20,670
It's his round.

6478
07:20:25,010 --> 07:20:25,970
I think...

6479
07:20:25,970 --> 07:20:28,010
I think our team's just overall better.

6480
07:20:28,190 --> 07:20:29,510
Maybe better at tanks.

6481
07:20:31,630 --> 07:20:31,890
Yeah.

6482
07:20:32,050 --> 07:20:33,310
This is what coms did.

6483
07:20:34,050 --> 07:20:36,090
We started coms and then we just...

6484
07:20:36,090 --> 07:20:37,010
Everything went downhill.

6485
07:20:38,010 --> 07:20:39,550
Everything's already been downhill.

6486
07:20:39,890 --> 07:20:42,910
Everything went downhill with coms.

6487
07:20:45,190 --> 07:20:46,290
Alright, here we go.

6488
07:20:46,830 --> 07:20:47,490
Awesome time.

6489
07:20:52,850 --> 07:20:53,610
I'm gonna start inspiring.

6490
07:20:57,820 --> 07:20:58,340
Inspire!

6491
07:20:58,340 --> 07:21:00,860
This portal just brought us somewhere that we can walk.

6492
07:21:03,720 --> 07:21:04,160
Inspire!

6493
07:21:10,340 --> 07:21:11,280
People are dead.

6494
07:21:13,020 --> 07:21:14,420
I don't feel very inspired.

6495
07:21:16,040 --> 07:21:16,740
Me neither.

6496
07:21:18,220 --> 07:21:20,380
Especially after the play I just watched our Moon Knight make.

6497
07:21:21,100 --> 07:21:22,080
Yeah, why did he drop down?

6498
07:21:22,840 --> 07:21:23,740
I don't know.

6499
07:21:24,000 --> 07:21:27,980
That definitely did not inspire me.

6500
07:21:33,090 --> 07:21:35,110
He did not have to drop down there.

6501
07:21:38,350 --> 07:21:39,190
Oh dear.

6502
07:21:39,770 --> 07:21:40,050
Oh.

6503
07:21:42,230 --> 07:21:42,670
Whoa.

6504
07:21:53,760 --> 07:21:54,380
It's okay.

6505
07:21:54,540 --> 07:21:55,200
Now's our time.

6506
07:21:57,680 --> 07:21:58,680
Is it though?

6507
07:21:59,440 --> 07:22:00,880
Yeah, we're gonna cab this fight.

6508
07:22:01,240 --> 07:22:01,900
I'm feeling it.

6509
07:22:02,080 --> 07:22:02,640
Okay, me too.

6510
07:22:02,700 --> 07:22:03,260
I'm feeling it.

6511
07:22:03,500 --> 07:22:05,460
I am ready to put on a show!

6512
07:22:05,560 --> 07:22:06,180
They're putting on a show.

6513
07:22:06,400 --> 07:22:07,760
But don't worry, I'm icing up.

6514
07:22:08,700 --> 07:22:09,260
Alright.

6515
07:22:09,880 --> 07:22:11,580
I'm trying to inspire people too.

6516
07:22:12,500 --> 07:22:13,760
I'm putting on a show.

6517
07:22:14,620 --> 07:22:15,800
I got headshot.

6518
07:22:18,120 --> 07:22:20,140
Oh, he headshot someone else too.

6519
07:22:20,340 --> 07:22:21,860
I am ready to put on a show!

6520
07:22:21,940 --> 07:22:22,580
Oh, that's cool.

6521
07:22:23,940 --> 07:22:24,500
Um.

6522
07:22:29,060 --> 07:22:30,180
You know...

6523
07:22:30,180 --> 07:22:31,960
I think...

6524
07:22:31,960 --> 07:22:33,280
Maybe next game's our game.

6525
07:22:35,180 --> 07:22:36,420
Maybe it's next game.

6526
07:22:40,650 --> 07:22:41,790
Maybe it's next game.

6527
07:22:41,950 --> 07:22:42,790
It's gotta be this one.

6528
07:22:43,270 --> 07:22:44,730
No, I don't think it's this one.

6529
07:22:45,190 --> 07:22:48,150
I don't think it's this one.

6530
07:22:48,370 --> 07:22:54,410
I think you're not in the same game as I am.

6531
07:22:54,510 --> 07:22:56,150
I think you have someone's bot open.

6532
07:22:56,470 --> 07:22:58,950
I think you have someone's bot open right now.

6533
07:23:00,330 --> 07:23:02,790
And you're watching that game and you're not playing this lobby.

6534
07:23:07,960 --> 07:23:10,260
I don't know who I inspired, but I inspired somebody.

6535
07:23:12,100 --> 07:23:13,220
We're undefeatable.

6536
07:23:14,920 --> 07:23:15,900
Oh, nice.

6537
07:23:17,300 --> 07:23:18,320
Not nice.

6538
07:23:18,780 --> 07:23:21,520
I didn't even see the Magneto!

6539
07:23:29,840 --> 07:23:30,960
This is...

6540
07:23:31,820 --> 07:23:33,400
One of the games of all time.

6541
07:23:33,680 --> 07:23:34,080
For sure.

6542
07:23:34,240 --> 07:23:34,520
Really?

6543
07:23:34,640 --> 07:23:35,700
We've had a lot of them.

6544
07:23:36,240 --> 07:23:39,300
And I think all of them were with me.

6545
07:23:43,760 --> 07:23:44,720
At least...

6546
07:23:44,720 --> 07:23:45,920
Okay, that's probably for sure, though.

6547
07:23:46,200 --> 07:23:47,020
I'm on the flank.

6548
07:23:54,320 --> 07:23:55,840
Alright, that didn't work.

6549
07:24:00,740 --> 07:24:02,000
The moon haunts you.

6550
07:24:03,480 --> 07:24:05,560
Wait, our Bucky's going off.

6551
07:24:05,820 --> 07:24:06,140
No!

6552
07:24:06,600 --> 07:24:09,540
There's a fucking Doctor Strange behind us!

6553
07:24:10,280 --> 07:24:11,400
Oh, frick.

6554
07:24:13,180 --> 07:24:14,500
This might have been my fault.

6555
07:24:16,080 --> 07:24:17,540
No, I don't think.

6556
07:24:18,680 --> 07:24:21,140
If we got that point, we were just...

6557
07:24:21,140 --> 07:24:21,180
Even if we won.

6558
07:24:21,660 --> 07:24:23,780
We were just delaying it.

6559
07:24:24,260 --> 07:24:25,380
I was sacrificing...

6560
07:24:25,380 --> 07:24:26,540
I was saving us.

6561
07:24:27,400 --> 07:24:29,260
From three more minutes of disappointment.

6562
07:24:29,800 --> 07:24:29,920
Exactly.

6563
07:24:30,480 --> 07:24:33,980
From a longer game.

6564
07:24:34,560 --> 07:24:35,520
You saved us.

6565
07:24:35,900 --> 07:24:36,580
From more pain.

6566
07:24:37,840 --> 07:24:38,140
Honestly.

6567
07:24:39,860 --> 07:24:41,760
I am ready to put on a show.

6568
07:24:43,800 --> 07:24:45,620
We just won our next two games!

6569
07:24:46,140 --> 07:24:46,980
Yeah.

6570
07:24:47,300 --> 07:24:47,700
Yeah.

6571
07:24:48,840 --> 07:24:49,560
Yeah.

6572
07:24:51,980 --> 07:24:53,160
That'd be easy.

6573
07:24:53,740 --> 07:24:54,100
Yeah.

6574
07:24:55,100 --> 07:24:56,260
I believe.

6575
07:24:57,840 --> 07:24:59,180
Just two games.

6576
07:25:00,480 --> 07:25:01,000
Right?

6577
07:25:01,260 --> 07:25:01,560
Just two.

6578
07:25:03,340 --> 07:25:04,060
Yeah.

6579
07:25:06,680 --> 07:25:08,520
How much did you lose for that one?

6580
07:25:08,800 --> 07:25:09,280
23.

6581
07:25:10,640 --> 07:25:12,100
Okay, it could be worse.

6582
07:25:12,520 --> 07:25:13,600
It could be worse, you're right.

6583
07:25:16,540 --> 07:25:17,580
This one...

6584
07:25:17,580 --> 07:25:18,760
It could be worse.

6585
07:25:21,660 --> 07:25:21,880
Yeah.

6586
07:25:22,160 --> 07:25:23,800
At least they can't ban Psylocke.

6587
07:25:24,720 --> 07:25:25,340
That's true.

6588
07:25:28,300 --> 07:25:30,200
You know, we just...

6589
07:25:30,200 --> 07:25:31,000
I'm feeling good about this one.

6590
07:25:31,360 --> 07:25:32,040
Yeah, me too.

6591
07:25:33,400 --> 07:25:36,380
All we need to do is get out of plat.

6592
07:25:37,300 --> 07:25:38,340
And then...

6593
07:25:38,340 --> 07:25:39,440
Get decent hours.

6594
07:25:39,800 --> 07:25:41,520
And then...

6595
07:25:42,140 --> 07:25:43,200
Games should be great.

6596
07:25:44,400 --> 07:25:44,800
Yeah.

6597
07:25:45,520 --> 07:25:47,720
Oh, but you're not gonna be playing, so...

6598
07:25:52,220 --> 07:25:54,000
I think Surefour said he's down.

6599
07:25:54,060 --> 07:25:54,820
He's down to play.

6600
07:25:55,280 --> 07:25:56,820
But I don't know when he's gonna stop.

6601
07:25:57,780 --> 07:25:58,180
Oh.

6602
07:25:59,560 --> 07:26:00,860
I don't know when he's gonna stop.

6603
07:26:00,900 --> 07:26:01,700
That's the problem.

6604
07:26:04,220 --> 07:26:05,300
You can just leave him.

6605
07:26:05,340 --> 07:26:08,660
Oh hey, they have the Iron and the Nyan Cat person.

6606
07:26:09,340 --> 07:26:09,700
Oh.

6607
07:26:10,980 --> 07:26:12,200
You're really different.

6608
07:26:12,960 --> 07:26:14,760
Oh, I stole Psylocke from a lesbian.

6609
07:26:15,280 --> 07:26:16,080
That's okay.

6610
07:26:16,960 --> 07:26:17,960
What a hero pool.

6611
07:26:18,200 --> 07:26:19,280
Psylocke and Jeff.

6612
07:26:19,380 --> 07:26:20,680
What a fucking hero pool.

6613
07:26:21,520 --> 07:26:22,080
Yeah.

6614
07:26:22,340 --> 07:26:23,540
I set the Jeff swap.

6615
07:26:27,000 --> 07:26:29,380
I didn't think they would play, you know...

6616
07:26:29,380 --> 07:26:30,320
Another DPS.

6617
07:26:33,840 --> 07:26:35,100
I'm not a fucking gamer.

6618
07:26:41,260 --> 07:26:42,420
This will be fine.

6619
07:26:46,770 --> 07:26:47,850
This will be fine.

6620
07:26:49,510 --> 07:26:51,770
This is a rematch of this map again.

6621
07:26:52,490 --> 07:26:53,910
Why did they do this to us?

6622
07:26:54,150 --> 07:26:55,510
Why can't we have a different map?

6623
07:26:56,210 --> 07:26:56,870
Oh no.

6624
07:26:57,710 --> 07:26:58,070
Why?

6625
07:26:58,550 --> 07:26:59,870
Why did they do this?

6626
07:27:10,920 --> 07:27:11,680
It's alright.

6627
07:27:11,880 --> 07:27:12,380
This time.

6628
07:27:17,310 --> 07:27:18,730
This time it'll be different.

6629
07:27:19,630 --> 07:27:20,670
I gave you an orb.

6630
07:27:22,470 --> 07:27:24,950
But you might lose it if our tanks are...

6631
07:27:24,950 --> 07:27:25,170
Oh.

6632
07:27:26,210 --> 07:27:26,730
Nice.

6633
07:27:27,470 --> 07:27:29,970
You might lose it if the tanks feel a little bit feedy.

6634
07:27:41,790 --> 07:27:42,330
He's Groot.

6635
07:27:49,360 --> 07:27:50,220
He's Groot.

6636
07:27:54,440 --> 07:27:55,360
He's Groot.

6637
07:28:01,550 --> 07:28:02,550
Okay, Groot.

6638
07:28:07,400 --> 07:28:08,860
Gotta chill a little, man.

6639
07:28:09,080 --> 07:28:09,740
My dude.

6640
07:28:10,520 --> 07:28:11,000
Ouch.

6641
07:28:11,860 --> 07:28:13,100
Chill a little, dude.

6642
07:28:13,780 --> 07:28:15,420
Gotta chill just a little bit.

6643
07:28:16,060 --> 07:28:17,640
Alright, you're losing your orb privileges.

6644
07:28:18,060 --> 07:28:21,340
These tanks are doing too much fucking...

6645
07:28:21,340 --> 07:28:22,060
Okay, okay.

6646
07:28:22,340 --> 07:28:23,800
They're feeding a little too much.

6647
07:28:24,660 --> 07:28:26,400
You're gonna be losing your orb privileges now.

6648
07:28:26,500 --> 07:28:28,120
Oh my god, they're both support ults.

6649
07:28:31,320 --> 07:28:33,100
Oh, the Punisher's so low.

6650
07:28:41,340 --> 07:28:42,240
The Punisher's one.

6651
07:28:43,720 --> 07:28:44,400
He's Groot.

6652
07:28:46,340 --> 07:28:47,520
The Groot's one, too!

6653
07:28:47,580 --> 07:28:48,180
The Groot's one!

6654
07:28:49,360 --> 07:28:49,900
Eliminated.

6655
07:28:50,720 --> 07:28:51,260
Okay,

6656
07:28:55,010 --> 07:28:55,170
nice.

6657
07:28:55,270 --> 07:28:55,510
I have ult.

6658
07:28:57,970 --> 07:28:58,810
I have mine, too.

6659
07:28:59,690 --> 07:29:01,590
It will be awesome time next fight.

6660
07:29:05,170 --> 07:29:05,610
Nice.

6661
07:29:07,730 --> 07:29:08,350
Good fight.

6662
07:29:11,900 --> 07:29:13,440
I was using that.

6663
07:29:19,280 --> 07:29:19,960
Okay.

6664
07:29:23,500 --> 07:29:25,040
I think they have Groot ult.

6665
07:29:25,480 --> 07:29:26,320
They haven't used it yet.

6666
07:29:27,300 --> 07:29:28,860
Oh, they're Groot.

6667
07:29:29,600 --> 07:29:29,760
Oh!

6668
07:29:30,120 --> 07:29:30,700
Alright.

6669
07:29:31,240 --> 07:29:32,580
Time to dance!

6670
07:29:34,700 --> 07:29:37,120
Everyone here is just...

6671
07:29:37,120 --> 07:29:38,160
Oh, okay.

6672
07:29:38,500 --> 07:29:41,380
I don't even know how you died there.

6673
07:29:41,820 --> 07:29:43,400
I went boom, boom.

6674
07:29:44,840 --> 07:29:45,820
Where did your HP go?

6675
07:29:45,820 --> 07:29:47,940
It was my Judge Dre and Executioner.

6676
07:29:54,610 --> 07:29:54,890
Okay.

6677
07:30:01,320 --> 07:30:01,660
It's fine.

6678
07:30:02,620 --> 07:30:03,260
We held it.

6679
07:30:03,800 --> 07:30:04,300
For now.

6680
07:30:05,400 --> 07:30:06,300
For now, Judge.

6681
07:30:06,560 --> 07:30:07,120
For now.

6682
07:30:18,920 --> 07:30:19,680
Got you.

6683
07:30:20,920 --> 07:30:21,500
Thank you.

6684
07:30:25,780 --> 07:30:26,940
That's a good trick, huh?

6685
07:30:29,140 --> 07:30:29,720
Oh.

6686
07:30:31,020 --> 07:30:31,600
Oh.

6687
07:30:31,760 --> 07:30:31,940
No!

6688
07:30:32,620 --> 07:30:33,200
Lesbians!

6689
07:30:36,560 --> 07:30:37,980
They're pressing all their buttons.

6690
07:30:37,980 --> 07:30:38,500
No!

6691
07:30:40,100 --> 07:30:41,260
Oh, frick.

6692
07:30:41,560 --> 07:30:42,780
I got hit by a stray.

6693
07:30:43,060 --> 07:30:44,620
We had no defense ult.

6694
07:30:49,760 --> 07:30:51,820
Jeff, why are you a shark?

6695
07:30:52,960 --> 07:30:53,540
Why?

6696
07:30:57,040 --> 07:30:57,680
Oh, Jeff.

6697
07:30:58,040 --> 07:30:59,000
How many did Jeff get?

6698
07:30:59,820 --> 07:31:00,640
Jeff, how many?

6699
07:31:00,820 --> 07:31:02,320
Jeff died!

6700
07:31:03,540 --> 07:31:05,780
I don't think he got anybody!

6701
07:31:12,000 --> 07:31:13,440
Did he even get anyone?

6702
07:31:14,520 --> 07:31:15,580
I don't think he did.

6703
07:31:15,860 --> 07:31:17,600
Jeff, how do you not get anybody?

6704
07:31:31,150 --> 07:31:32,470
Alright, this time for sure.

6705
07:31:32,630 --> 07:31:34,310
Alright, I'll give you back your orb.

6706
07:31:34,730 --> 07:31:35,830
You have your privilege again.

6707
07:31:36,730 --> 07:31:36,950
Yay!

6708
07:31:39,910 --> 07:31:41,150
I'm feeling privileged.

6709
07:31:42,710 --> 07:31:44,510
I'm fighting Captain America.

6710
07:31:45,550 --> 07:31:49,910
Alright, Penny is feeding, so you're getting all the heals right now.

6711
07:31:50,030 --> 07:31:50,170
That's perfect.

6712
07:31:50,170 --> 07:31:50,970
So you should live.

6713
07:31:53,150 --> 07:31:53,830
Um...

6714
07:31:53,830 --> 07:31:54,450
You should...

6715
07:31:54,450 --> 07:31:55,750
Aw, yay.

6716
07:31:56,690 --> 07:31:56,850
Aw.

6717
07:31:58,990 --> 07:32:02,770
I had a feeling when I saw zero kills on the feed.

6718
07:32:03,710 --> 07:32:05,230
I had a feeling.

6719
07:32:08,110 --> 07:32:10,030
I am dancing.

6720
07:32:10,550 --> 07:32:12,670
I have forced the undefeatable ult.

6721
07:32:14,710 --> 07:32:15,770
Oh no.

6722
07:32:16,310 --> 07:32:17,010
Oh.

6723
07:32:17,650 --> 07:32:19,610
Oh, where am I?

6724
07:32:25,060 --> 07:32:26,180
Oh no.

6725
07:32:28,420 --> 07:32:28,980
Again?

6726
07:32:30,000 --> 07:32:32,960
Oh, you forced the mantis ult.

6727
07:32:33,080 --> 07:32:33,300
Okay.

6728
07:32:34,580 --> 07:32:36,480
Okay, I was like, what?

6729
07:32:36,820 --> 07:32:37,460
Too many.

6730
07:32:38,360 --> 07:32:39,140
Ow.

6731
07:32:39,800 --> 07:32:40,940
Jeff, please.

6732
07:32:41,960 --> 07:32:44,680
You don't need to be a shark no more.

6733
07:32:46,640 --> 07:32:47,240
Please.

6734
07:32:48,220 --> 07:32:50,460
You can be a mantis.

6735
07:32:50,460 --> 07:32:51,980
It's just like a shark.

6736
07:32:52,160 --> 07:32:53,960
It's the shark of the bug world.

6737
07:32:57,500 --> 07:32:59,860
This is the shark of the bug world.

6738
07:33:05,710 --> 07:33:06,770
He's so low.

6739
07:33:08,810 --> 07:33:09,410
Bam.

6740
07:33:14,710 --> 07:33:16,030
Oh my god, grid's low too.

6741
07:33:16,730 --> 07:33:17,490
Let's go.

6742
07:33:18,370 --> 07:33:19,910
Okay, Jeff, you did not have to...

6743
07:33:19,910 --> 07:33:20,950
Okay, that's fine, Jeff.

6744
07:33:21,330 --> 07:33:22,890
You just ulted in a 6v4.

6745
07:33:24,670 --> 07:33:25,850
Did you get anyone?

6746
07:33:26,590 --> 07:33:27,210
I don't know.

6747
07:33:27,970 --> 07:33:28,950
But the mantis is low.

6748
07:33:30,290 --> 07:33:31,090
What did he get?

6749
07:33:35,530 --> 07:33:37,290
Jeff did not need to do that.

6750
07:33:37,630 --> 07:33:38,490
That's all I'm saying.

6751
07:33:39,630 --> 07:33:40,410
I agree.

6752
07:33:41,990 --> 07:33:43,270
Alright, I have one...

6753
07:33:43,270 --> 07:33:47,170
I have my defensive ult against all their...

6754
07:33:47,170 --> 07:33:49,330
against one of their five aggression ults.

6755
07:33:49,510 --> 07:33:50,850
So we'll see how it goes.

6756
07:33:51,750 --> 07:33:52,270
Easy.

6757
07:33:54,230 --> 07:33:55,190
Captain America's frozen.

6758
07:33:57,030 --> 07:33:58,070
Captain America's one.

6759
07:33:58,890 --> 07:33:59,330
Assemble.

6760
07:34:01,130 --> 07:34:02,250
Alright, here we go.

6761
07:34:04,390 --> 07:34:05,370
It's the grand finale.

6762
07:34:05,930 --> 07:34:07,310
That guy threw a fish at nothing.

6763
07:34:07,770 --> 07:34:09,070
Yep, I saw that.

6764
07:34:09,250 --> 07:34:10,690
Alright, Captain America's gonna ult here.

6765
07:34:13,690 --> 07:34:14,870
Oh, he's not?

6766
07:34:15,010 --> 07:34:15,230
Okay.

6767
07:34:15,530 --> 07:34:16,030
That's fine.

6768
07:34:17,670 --> 07:34:19,410
That's fine if he doesn't want to.

6769
07:34:22,360 --> 07:34:23,760
Oh my god.

6770
07:34:25,280 --> 07:34:27,140
Nevermind, it's dance time for them.

6771
07:34:29,720 --> 07:34:30,180
Captain America's ult!

6772
07:34:42,760 --> 07:34:43,400
He's low!

6773
07:34:43,400 --> 07:34:43,620
He's low!

6774
07:34:47,140 --> 07:34:48,180
Got you.

6775
07:34:49,260 --> 07:34:50,860
Okay, that's one fight left.

6776
07:34:51,460 --> 07:34:52,440
I'm not gonna get...

6777
07:34:52,440 --> 07:34:54,440
I'm not gonna get my ult in time for it.

6778
07:34:55,480 --> 07:34:57,640
Despite the amount of feeding they're doing.

6779
07:35:02,980 --> 07:35:04,300
I'm doing it.

6780
07:35:05,460 --> 07:35:05,980
Nice.

6781
07:35:06,640 --> 07:35:07,160
Oh!

6782
07:35:08,060 --> 07:35:09,880
I did not got you, apparently.

6783
07:35:13,500 --> 07:35:15,380
We are chillin'.

6784
07:35:15,820 --> 07:35:17,540
We are so chillin'.

6785
07:35:17,540 --> 07:35:20,040
Okay, I'm just gonna wait here.

6786
07:35:23,160 --> 07:35:23,520
Nice!

6787
07:35:24,660 --> 07:35:26,140
Alright, we just gotta push all the way there.

6788
07:35:26,260 --> 07:35:27,120
It can't be that bad, right?

6789
07:35:27,420 --> 07:35:28,400
It can't be that bad!

6790
07:35:29,140 --> 07:35:30,140
We can push it all the way there!

6791
07:35:31,640 --> 07:35:32,000
Yippee!

6792
07:35:33,380 --> 07:35:34,320
No, we actually can't.

6793
07:35:34,420 --> 07:35:36,760
Wait, things are looking much better than I initially thought.

6794
07:35:37,440 --> 07:35:38,620
Wait, did we lose a game?

6795
07:35:39,660 --> 07:35:41,180
Oh, we lost a game on this map.

6796
07:35:41,260 --> 07:35:42,240
That's why it feels so bad.

6797
07:35:44,020 --> 07:35:44,760
Everything's a blur.

6798
07:35:45,360 --> 07:35:46,500
They all blur together.

6799
07:35:46,740 --> 07:35:47,740
There's so many games.

6800
07:35:47,920 --> 07:35:48,720
We play so many.

6801
07:35:50,440 --> 07:35:52,040
You know, we're 15 and 13 right now.

6802
07:35:52,060 --> 07:35:53,040
Getting the plat was so easy.

6803
07:35:54,360 --> 07:35:55,760
We're 13 and what?

6804
07:35:56,340 --> 07:35:57,560
We're 15 and 13.

6805
07:35:57,780 --> 07:35:58,420
Oh my god.

6806
07:35:59,640 --> 07:36:00,600
That hurts.

6807
07:36:05,000 --> 07:36:06,180
We're so close.

6808
07:36:06,740 --> 07:36:07,720
We're so close.

6809
07:36:08,340 --> 07:36:09,200
That hurts.

6810
07:36:09,720 --> 07:36:10,560
That hurts.

6811
07:36:15,720 --> 07:36:18,180
Getting the plat took me 6 hours.

6812
07:36:18,900 --> 07:36:21,800
And then I'm stuck in this hellhole.

6813
07:36:23,620 --> 07:36:27,340
It took me 6 hours in like a day and a half.

6814
07:36:28,820 --> 07:36:31,700
And now we're still plat.

6815
07:36:31,880 --> 07:36:33,740
Well, at least you hit diamond.

6816
07:36:34,480 --> 07:36:35,800
And we're gonna hit it again.

6817
07:36:40,560 --> 07:36:41,380
Oh.

6818
07:36:46,360 --> 07:36:47,720
It'll be different.

6819
07:36:58,420 --> 07:36:59,500
That's lit.

6820
07:36:59,700 --> 07:37:00,520
Awesome time.

6821
07:37:00,740 --> 07:37:01,300
That's lit.

6822
07:37:04,800 --> 07:37:06,460
Super duper lit.

6823
07:37:09,380 --> 07:37:11,880
I believe there's an enemy directly above me.

6824
07:37:14,180 --> 07:37:16,700
You have orb so you're fine for now.

6825
07:37:18,120 --> 07:37:19,080
Yes, yes.

6826
07:37:21,200 --> 07:37:22,380
Our sharko died.

6827
07:37:22,540 --> 07:37:23,660
That means I can heal you more.

6828
07:37:26,860 --> 07:37:28,180
I've eliminated the enemy.

6829
07:37:29,040 --> 07:37:30,420
Don't worry, you have unlimited heals.

6830
07:37:32,640 --> 07:37:33,940
Our strange is feeding.

6831
07:37:34,140 --> 07:37:34,900
You have so much heals.

6832
07:37:35,420 --> 07:37:36,960
Oh, okay.

6833
07:37:37,220 --> 07:37:39,480
Okay, like I still...

6834
07:37:39,480 --> 07:37:39,820
Okay.

6835
07:37:42,160 --> 07:37:44,140
I got slapped by a mantis.

6836
07:37:44,400 --> 07:37:44,700
Yeah.

6837
07:37:47,280 --> 07:37:49,380
The heals are not that strong.

6838
07:37:53,460 --> 07:37:55,580
Despite what you want to believe.

6839
07:37:56,420 --> 07:37:56,800
Oh.

6840
07:38:04,160 --> 07:38:05,200
We're strange.

6841
07:38:05,500 --> 07:38:06,280
Oh no, we're strange.

6842
07:38:06,280 --> 07:38:06,820
Oh no.

6843
07:38:08,680 --> 07:38:10,920
Oh my god.

6844
07:38:14,740 --> 07:38:16,880
Oh no, our shark died.

6845
07:38:17,800 --> 07:38:19,480
But I baited their ult out.

6846
07:38:21,380 --> 07:38:23,180
I baited their dancing.

6847
07:38:23,440 --> 07:38:25,020
Oh my god, Namor, why did you sub in the fucking...

6848
07:38:25,020 --> 07:38:26,580
That's good, that means I'll get to ult soon.

6849
07:38:27,660 --> 07:38:28,960
They used Groot ult too.

6850
07:38:30,040 --> 07:38:30,480
That's great.

6851
07:38:31,620 --> 07:38:33,520
That's great, that's great, they used everything.

6852
07:38:36,440 --> 07:38:37,960
Okay, I have a plan for this fight.

6853
07:38:37,980 --> 07:38:39,280
I don't think he plays DPS.

6854
07:38:39,580 --> 07:38:41,940
I don't think Namor knows what he's doing.

6855
07:38:42,420 --> 07:38:43,160
Uh oh.

6856
07:38:44,060 --> 07:38:52,760
Cause like, I literally saw him fucking Namor ult a dance ult that was there already like a minute ago.

6857
07:38:53,360 --> 07:38:56,280
He has not gotten anything with his Namor ults.

6858
07:38:58,800 --> 07:38:59,640
Only TP.

6859
07:39:00,260 --> 07:39:00,700
Nice.

6860
07:39:01,960 --> 07:39:04,260
Alright, I'm gonna wait until that's gone.

6861
07:39:04,260 --> 07:39:05,360
Okay, we can go back in.

6862
07:39:06,280 --> 07:39:06,760
Nice.

6863
07:39:10,580 --> 07:39:13,800
Groot was low.

6864
07:39:26,600 --> 07:39:27,860
He will not get the again.

6865
07:39:30,720 --> 07:39:32,120
Be alive!

6866
07:39:33,040 --> 07:39:34,020
Be alive!

6867
07:39:35,460 --> 07:39:36,460
Let's go.

6868
07:39:42,500 --> 07:39:44,680
Alright, you get your privilege back.

6869
07:39:45,460 --> 07:39:46,160
Yay.

6870
07:39:49,000 --> 07:39:50,600
Okay, goodbye Namor.

6871
07:39:51,180 --> 07:39:52,560
Bye bye Namor.

6872
07:39:53,560 --> 07:39:56,440
Oh, bye bye Dr. Strange.

6873
07:39:56,900 --> 07:39:59,760
Yeah, everybody's dying so I'm just gonna leave.

6874
07:40:04,990 --> 07:40:06,430
Oh, please.

6875
07:40:10,950 --> 07:40:11,670
Please!

6876
07:40:12,390 --> 07:40:13,210
Lesbian, please!

6877
07:40:13,610 --> 07:40:15,390
Don't stand on the rock!

6878
07:40:17,290 --> 07:40:19,130
That's all you've been doing!

6879
07:40:32,200 --> 07:40:35,420
Wait, wait, Groot's low, Groot's low.

6880
07:40:36,060 --> 07:40:37,600
Nice, we got Groot.

6881
07:40:44,280 --> 07:40:48,460
We're getting healed by the tanks that's also taking damage.

6882
07:40:49,320 --> 07:40:50,560
That's great, that's great.

6883
07:40:51,500 --> 07:40:52,260
We're getting healed by Namor.

6884
07:40:52,260 --> 07:40:53,980
I was using that, Dr. Strange.

6885
07:40:54,260 --> 07:40:54,780
Oh, fuck.

6886
07:40:56,940 --> 07:40:58,920
That's fine, you wanted to bait that, right?

6887
07:40:59,720 --> 07:41:00,420
Yeah, yeah.

6888
07:41:04,240 --> 07:41:05,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6889
07:41:08,580 --> 07:41:10,080
Oh no, he's gonna get the again.

6890
07:41:11,040 --> 07:41:11,440
Again!

6891
07:41:12,440 --> 07:41:13,020
That's fine.

6892
07:41:14,460 --> 07:41:15,980
That's not fine, don't worry.

6893
07:41:17,120 --> 07:41:17,920
Oh, nice.

6894
07:41:21,180 --> 07:41:22,540
See, everything is fine.

6895
07:41:22,660 --> 07:41:23,800
Guys, guys, please push the cart.

6896
07:41:24,100 --> 07:41:25,020
Please, we just need two!

6897
07:41:25,080 --> 07:41:26,020
We just need two people!

6898
07:41:32,690 --> 07:41:33,210
Okay, we got two people.

6899
07:41:33,210 --> 07:41:34,070
We got it.

6900
07:41:35,670 --> 07:41:37,010
That's good, they wasted that!

6901
07:41:37,170 --> 07:41:37,650
They didn't know!

6902
07:41:38,370 --> 07:41:39,590
They didn't know we got the cart!

6903
07:41:40,570 --> 07:41:41,590
They're so stupid!

6904
07:41:43,550 --> 07:41:44,530
Oh, thank goodness.

6905
07:41:48,250 --> 07:41:49,330
They didn't know!

6906
07:41:49,690 --> 07:41:50,870
They thought it was over!

6907
07:41:51,830 --> 07:41:52,710
That's really good.

6908
07:41:53,090 --> 07:41:54,890
They're so stupid.

6909
07:41:56,130 --> 07:41:57,030
That's fucking right.

6910
07:41:58,650 --> 07:42:01,030
That's why you'll stay in plat and I'll go back to diamond.

6911
07:42:02,390 --> 07:42:03,070
Yes, ma'am.

6912
07:42:06,670 --> 07:42:07,490
Oh no.

6913
07:42:07,930 --> 07:42:08,870
Oh my bad.

6914
07:42:08,970 --> 07:42:10,390
I shouldn't have said that.

6915
07:42:10,530 --> 07:42:12,850
I might lose because I said that.

6916
07:42:13,150 --> 07:42:14,190
No, no, no.

6917
07:42:15,130 --> 07:42:16,050
Everything is awesome.

6918
07:42:22,150 --> 07:42:23,310
Okay, everything is fine.

6919
07:42:25,190 --> 07:42:27,530
There's like a Moon Knight up top.

6920
07:42:28,290 --> 07:42:29,630
What the flip is happening?

6921
07:42:30,270 --> 07:42:31,110
He's over there still.

6922
07:42:31,130 --> 07:42:31,850
I'm gonna go on Moon Knight.

6923
07:42:40,600 --> 07:42:41,580
Double KO!

6924
07:42:41,960 --> 07:42:43,580
There's a group right in front of us.

6925
07:42:43,880 --> 07:42:44,480
Can we just have?

6926
07:42:46,760 --> 07:42:47,600
He's one, he's one.

6927
07:42:54,780 --> 07:42:55,520
There's the guy.

6928
07:42:58,460 --> 07:42:59,320
I got it.

6929
07:43:06,650 --> 07:43:07,450
Where's the Moon?

6930
07:43:10,970 --> 07:43:13,790
Alright, we're getting closer.

6931
07:43:15,030 --> 07:43:18,250
We have like two fights left.

6932
07:43:26,000 --> 07:43:27,960
Did I even touch this?

6933
07:43:28,740 --> 07:43:29,600
Yes, you can.

6934
07:43:29,760 --> 07:43:30,380
Yes, you can.

6935
07:43:31,140 --> 07:43:34,320
They literally just did.

6936
07:43:34,520 --> 07:43:35,320
Oh no.

6937
07:43:40,900 --> 07:43:41,580
No!

6938
07:43:45,650 --> 07:43:47,450
He's so good.

6939
07:43:54,240 --> 07:43:54,880
No!

6940
07:43:55,440 --> 07:43:57,480
He fucking solo defeated this whore!

6941
07:44:00,300 --> 07:44:04,160
I hope he loses all his coins and he deranks the gold.

6942
07:44:07,340 --> 07:44:08,180
Fuck that guy.

6943
07:44:08,780 --> 07:44:10,160
I'm gonna stalk through your profile.

6944
07:44:10,160 --> 07:44:11,820
Make sure you stay in plat.

6945
07:44:12,480 --> 07:44:13,360
Oh, oh.

6946
07:44:14,200 --> 07:44:15,160
We're gonna Q snipe him.

6947
07:44:16,780 --> 07:44:18,420
I'll make sure.

6948
07:44:19,080 --> 07:44:21,260
Every day I'm gonna check your career profile.

6949
07:44:21,580 --> 07:44:23,220
So you never get to diamond.

6950
07:44:28,400 --> 07:44:29,580
God, I'm 93.

6951
07:44:30,100 --> 07:44:31,040
I'm 93.

6952
07:44:31,700 --> 07:44:34,000
Okay, this is the one for sure.

6953
07:44:35,340 --> 07:44:36,820
I'm gonna fucking avoid you too.

6954
07:44:37,020 --> 07:44:37,820
Oh, I couldn't.

6955
07:44:38,020 --> 07:44:39,340
You're so lucky.

6956
07:44:41,840 --> 07:44:44,180
So I could farm you for this.

6957
07:44:49,250 --> 07:44:51,590
Surely we can't lose another rank up game.

6958
07:44:51,710 --> 07:44:52,630
I don't know.

6959
07:44:52,770 --> 07:44:54,590
We got the Nyan Cat balling guy.

6960
07:44:55,630 --> 07:44:58,530
Didn't that person struggle again?

6961
07:44:59,530 --> 07:45:01,670
He did earlier, but...

6962
07:45:01,670 --> 07:45:03,410
I have a good feeling.

6963
07:45:12,170 --> 07:45:12,630
Yeah?

6964
07:45:14,030 --> 07:45:15,330
I'm a little worried.

6965
07:45:16,370 --> 07:45:17,730
I'm feeling good about this.

6966
07:45:17,810 --> 07:45:18,650
I'm a little worried.

6967
07:45:19,870 --> 07:45:21,230
I'm a little worried.

6968
07:45:21,810 --> 07:45:22,610
No, no, no.

6969
07:45:22,610 --> 07:45:23,970
I'm a little worried.

6970
07:45:24,310 --> 07:45:25,930
No, there's nothing to worry about.

6971
07:45:26,330 --> 07:45:28,810
If we lose this one, we can just keep Q'ing.

6972
07:45:29,350 --> 07:45:30,130
Yeah, but...

6973
07:45:30,130 --> 07:45:31,870
Would it be easier if we avoid him?

6974
07:45:33,710 --> 07:45:34,810
Oh, should we avoid him?

6975
07:45:35,030 --> 07:45:35,530
I don't know.

6976
07:45:36,450 --> 07:45:38,090
Was he carrying last game?

6977
07:45:38,190 --> 07:45:38,910
I don't know.

6978
07:45:39,970 --> 07:45:40,710
I don't remember.

6979
07:45:41,570 --> 07:45:43,950
Yeah, so he was not then if you don't remember.

6980
07:45:45,130 --> 07:45:46,310
He was pretty good on Bucky.

6981
07:45:46,370 --> 07:45:47,530
He was getting hooks on our group.

6982
07:45:47,610 --> 07:45:48,070
Oh, was he?

6983
07:45:48,150 --> 07:45:48,690
Was it Bucky?

6984
07:45:49,210 --> 07:45:50,250
Yeah, he was the Bucky.

6985
07:45:51,030 --> 07:45:51,870
Okay, okay.

6986
07:45:52,430 --> 07:45:56,090
Because I know as Punisher, he was struggling a little.

6987
07:45:56,650 --> 07:45:57,290
Last map.

6988
07:45:58,150 --> 07:46:01,330
But we had him for a few games earlier on Punisher and we won those.

6989
07:46:01,650 --> 07:46:02,130
Oh, okay.

6990
07:46:02,290 --> 07:46:03,250
I think he's just unlucky.

6991
07:46:04,170 --> 07:46:06,690
If you're watching, because I know they're watching you.

6992
07:46:06,950 --> 07:46:10,070
If you're watching this, Nyan Cat, I don't take it back.

6993
07:46:14,550 --> 07:46:16,270
Marvel Rivals is changing you.

6994
07:46:16,560 --> 07:46:17,830
First impressions matter.

6995
07:46:18,190 --> 07:46:19,970
And that was not a good first impression.

6996
07:46:26,360 --> 07:46:27,720
Don't meet your heroes.

6997
07:46:28,100 --> 07:46:31,300
Even if your hero is not the one that you're watching.

6998
07:46:36,720 --> 07:46:38,540
There's so much damage.

6999
07:46:39,880 --> 07:46:40,840
Wait, I'll give you the orb.

7000
07:46:41,560 --> 07:46:42,960
You have the orb.

7001
07:46:43,980 --> 07:46:44,720
Thank you.

7002
07:46:56,040 --> 07:46:56,960
You're fine.

7003
07:46:57,340 --> 07:46:59,960
I'm healing somebody that's getting damage right now.

7004
07:46:59,980 --> 07:47:00,660
Which is the tank.

7005
07:47:00,980 --> 07:47:03,100
I'm healing them still, so you're fine.

7006
07:47:04,200 --> 07:47:04,680
Awesome.

7007
07:47:05,320 --> 07:47:08,420
You're still getting the heals because he's still getting damage.

7008
07:47:10,400 --> 07:47:11,520
Where's that Iron Man?

7009
07:47:12,880 --> 07:47:13,840
That guy's dead as hell.

7010
07:47:14,400 --> 07:47:15,600
You're still getting heals.

7011
07:47:16,500 --> 07:47:17,020
Thank you.

7012
07:47:17,300 --> 07:47:18,180
They're putting on a show.

7013
07:47:18,980 --> 07:47:20,900
Oh man, having two tanks must be really nice.

7014
07:47:21,320 --> 07:47:22,800
To be able to do that.

7015
07:47:26,760 --> 07:47:28,020
Penny Parker's one.

7016
07:47:28,120 --> 07:47:29,460
Yeah, got her.

7017
07:47:31,720 --> 07:47:32,360
I'm healing.

7018
07:47:33,660 --> 07:47:35,220
Oh my god!

7019
07:47:35,420 --> 07:47:37,860
How much damage did you take?

7020
07:47:38,820 --> 07:47:39,160
Okay.

7021
07:47:40,020 --> 07:47:41,620
Okay, I'm putting a show too now.

7022
07:47:42,200 --> 07:47:42,860
It's my turn.

7023
07:47:44,160 --> 07:47:44,920
Kill him.

7024
07:47:45,040 --> 07:47:45,320
Nice.

7025
07:47:45,840 --> 07:47:46,440
Nice show.

7026
07:47:46,720 --> 07:47:47,720
I'm DPSing.

7027
07:47:48,960 --> 07:47:49,840
Excellent performance.

7028
07:47:50,080 --> 07:47:50,440
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

7029
07:47:50,440 --> 07:47:50,860
Thank you.

7030
07:47:51,260 --> 07:47:52,540
Alright, you're fine.

7031
07:47:53,400 --> 07:47:54,240
Oh my god.

7032
07:47:55,000 --> 07:47:55,460
You're so healthy.

7033
07:47:57,020 --> 07:47:57,460
I'm very healthy.

7034
07:47:58,800 --> 07:47:59,560
You know what?

7035
07:47:59,580 --> 07:48:01,380
Today before stream, I exercised.

7036
07:48:01,620 --> 07:48:02,920
Oh, you're so healthy!

7037
07:48:03,400 --> 07:48:04,360
Oh, thank you.

7038
07:48:04,460 --> 07:48:06,600
It's the first time in like a year.

7039
07:48:07,340 --> 07:48:08,260
You know what I did?

7040
07:48:09,220 --> 07:48:09,700
Yeah.

7041
07:48:10,840 --> 07:48:12,220
I played Marvel Rivals.

7042
07:48:15,620 --> 07:48:17,920
I already have 60 hours on this game.

7043
07:48:18,700 --> 07:48:21,080
I was there since closed alpha.

7044
07:48:21,580 --> 07:48:22,280
I was...

7045
07:48:28,020 --> 07:48:30,340
They added rank and it was over for me.

7046
07:48:30,800 --> 07:48:32,040
I was like, eh.

7047
07:48:32,580 --> 07:48:33,920
I'm not... I don't feel it.

7048
07:48:34,020 --> 07:48:35,640
I'm not feeling it that much.

7049
07:48:35,860 --> 07:48:38,380
And then they added rank and now I'm like, oh.

7050
07:48:39,280 --> 07:48:40,380
Now you're really addicted.

7051
07:48:41,100 --> 07:48:41,800
There it is.

7052
07:48:41,880 --> 07:48:43,500
That's what I was looking for.

7053
07:48:44,100 --> 07:48:44,980
There it is.

7054
07:48:45,200 --> 07:48:46,280
Right there.

7055
07:48:49,020 --> 07:48:49,980
Yeah, baby.

7056
07:48:51,380 --> 07:48:53,180
That was the fix I needed.

7057
07:48:56,600 --> 07:48:57,960
Wait, is he...

7058
07:48:58,920 --> 07:48:59,920
What in the world?

7059
07:49:00,500 --> 07:49:01,140
He's putting a show.

7060
07:49:02,580 --> 07:49:03,380
Oh, wow.

7061
07:49:05,400 --> 07:49:07,680
You still have the orb, so you don't have to worry about dying yet.

7062
07:49:08,780 --> 07:49:09,520
You're my goat.

7063
07:49:10,080 --> 07:49:11,440
You don't have to worry about dying yet.

7064
07:49:11,780 --> 07:49:12,500
I'm still healing.

7065
07:49:13,180 --> 07:49:14,160
You don't have to worry about dying.

7066
07:49:15,940 --> 07:49:17,540
You still don't have to worry about dying.

7067
07:49:18,440 --> 07:49:19,380
I'm all up in there.

7068
07:49:19,780 --> 07:49:20,780
Get in there, get in there.

7069
07:49:20,860 --> 07:49:21,980
Just keep getting in there.

7070
07:49:22,300 --> 07:49:23,440
I'm in there like swimwear.

7071
07:49:23,660 --> 07:49:25,880
I literally can see you in front of me, but you're not there.

7072
07:49:26,340 --> 07:49:27,500
I'm extremely in there.

7073
07:49:28,720 --> 07:49:30,360
Okay, I can't heal anymore.

7074
07:49:30,920 --> 07:49:31,520
Nobody's taking...

7075
07:49:32,100 --> 07:49:33,120
Nobody's getting damaged.

7076
07:49:33,640 --> 07:49:34,280
No problem.

7077
07:49:35,940 --> 07:49:36,860
Wait, there.

7078
07:49:39,020 --> 07:49:39,760
Oh, porno, porno, porno, porno.

7079
07:49:39,760 --> 07:49:40,340
They're teleporting.

7080
07:49:42,620 --> 07:49:42,980
What?

7081
07:49:43,180 --> 07:49:43,880
They're not taking it.

7082
07:49:44,020 --> 07:49:44,720
Oh my god, I'm on the back.

7083
07:49:44,990 --> 07:49:45,280
Nice.

7084
07:49:47,500 --> 07:49:48,140
We can live.

7085
07:49:49,900 --> 07:49:50,380
We're fine.

7086
07:49:51,120 --> 07:49:51,640
Let's get the Loki.

7087
07:49:51,820 --> 07:49:52,640
I'm DPSing.

7088
07:49:53,580 --> 07:49:54,000
Nice.

7089
07:49:55,520 --> 07:49:56,100
Yay!

7090
07:49:56,440 --> 07:49:57,660
You'll save my ass.

7091
07:50:00,420 --> 07:50:01,780
We're making it happen.

7092
07:50:02,240 --> 07:50:03,000
We're doing it.

7093
07:50:03,300 --> 07:50:04,720
No, no, no, you're jinxing it.

7094
07:50:05,200 --> 07:50:05,480
No.

7095
07:50:06,420 --> 07:50:07,520
You're gonna jinx it.

7096
07:50:08,100 --> 07:50:08,580
Please.

7097
07:50:11,280 --> 07:50:12,720
We're so close.

7098
07:50:13,780 --> 07:50:16,240
In the top 5, I'm just gonna be Diamond 2.

7099
07:50:18,680 --> 07:50:21,220
And then when we get Diamond 2, it's gonna be Diamond 1.

7100
07:50:22,180 --> 07:50:26,700
And then when I get to Diamond 2, it's gonna be high Diamond 2.

7101
07:50:30,120 --> 07:50:31,320
It doesn't stop.

7102
07:50:32,000 --> 07:50:33,180
And I'll be Grandmaster.

7103
07:50:33,760 --> 07:50:35,240
And then it'll be...

7104
07:50:35,240 --> 07:50:37,180
And then we'll never get there.

7105
07:50:42,860 --> 07:50:43,520
It's fine.

7106
07:50:50,530 --> 07:50:52,250
Nobody's getting damaged though.

7107
07:50:53,550 --> 07:50:54,890
That's fucking right.

7108
07:50:55,230 --> 07:50:55,930
Get eyed.

7109
07:50:57,050 --> 07:50:58,310
What the heck?

7110
07:51:02,710 --> 07:51:03,690
Get fucking eyed.

7111
07:51:06,050 --> 07:51:07,950
Are you alive?

7112
07:51:08,690 --> 07:51:09,130
Yep.

7113
07:51:09,590 --> 07:51:11,290
Oh shit, you're still alive?

7114
07:51:11,850 --> 07:51:12,250
Thank you.

7115
07:51:13,670 --> 07:51:15,750
I didn't even realize you were still alive.

7116
07:51:20,220 --> 07:51:20,640
Oh.

7117
07:51:21,540 --> 07:51:22,420
Oh fuck.

7118
07:51:22,540 --> 07:51:23,600
Okay, I was not alive.

7119
07:51:23,800 --> 07:51:26,220
Oh thank god.

7120
07:51:27,020 --> 07:51:27,840
Thank goodness.

7121
07:51:28,720 --> 07:51:29,260
Oh my god.

7122
07:51:30,460 --> 07:51:31,680
Okay, that was a good push.

7123
07:51:32,240 --> 07:51:34,260
Now all we have to do is not let them do that to us.

7124
07:51:34,980 --> 07:51:35,540
That's it.

7125
07:51:36,580 --> 07:51:37,300
That's it.

7126
07:51:37,660 --> 07:51:38,520
And then...

7127
07:51:38,520 --> 07:51:41,900
And then we're free for another day.

7128
07:51:44,100 --> 07:51:45,500
We're free for another day.

7129
07:51:46,740 --> 07:51:48,800
And then tomorrow, I go again.

7130
07:51:51,040 --> 07:51:52,080
It'll be fine.

7131
07:51:52,580 --> 07:51:55,500
Ryan will only play for a couple hours, so we can...

7132
07:51:55,500 --> 07:51:56,380
We can play after.

7133
07:51:57,600 --> 07:51:58,120
Yeah.

7134
07:51:58,600 --> 07:52:01,160
Wait, I thought he sleeps early.

7135
07:52:02,260 --> 07:52:03,340
Yeah, he does.

7136
07:52:03,540 --> 07:52:04,960
He's doing like a...

7137
07:52:04,960 --> 07:52:06,540
A Twitch bounty board thing.

7138
07:52:06,980 --> 07:52:07,300
Oh.

7139
07:52:09,220 --> 07:52:11,520
Wait, the Twitch bounty board is Marvel Rivals?

7140
07:52:12,760 --> 07:52:14,760
Yeah, he has a Marvel Rivals one.

7141
07:52:14,800 --> 07:52:15,680
I need to get one of those.

7142
07:52:16,400 --> 07:52:17,980
Oh, I know Scherfer got it.

7143
07:52:18,340 --> 07:52:19,840
Scherfer's getting it for tomorrow too.

7144
07:52:20,780 --> 07:52:21,220
Oh.

7145
07:52:21,220 --> 07:52:23,740
I don't know if he's personally sponsored or if it's a bounty.

7146
07:52:24,600 --> 07:52:30,220
Because you know how he said he has a sponsor for Marvel Rivals tomorrow, but I don't know if that's a bounty or an actual sponsor.

7147
07:52:30,700 --> 07:52:31,960
That's probably an actual one.

7148
07:52:32,780 --> 07:52:34,420
He's a big guy.

7149
07:52:34,660 --> 07:52:35,100
Oh.

7150
07:52:35,560 --> 07:52:37,260
Marvel Rivals, why aren't you sponsoring me?

7151
07:52:38,260 --> 07:52:39,120
If you're watching.

7152
07:52:39,340 --> 07:52:40,300
You could probably get it.

7153
07:52:40,600 --> 07:52:42,960
I don't know.

7154
07:52:43,860 --> 07:52:44,960
I do know.

7155
07:52:45,480 --> 07:52:46,440
Message Bogert.

7156
07:52:47,300 --> 07:52:47,860
Wait, really?

7157
07:52:48,300 --> 07:52:50,020
Why Bogert?

7158
07:52:50,180 --> 07:52:51,840
Because Bogert has the Necros connection.

7159
07:52:52,520 --> 07:52:53,520
What does that got?

7160
07:52:54,340 --> 07:52:57,780
Necros is like the sweet baby summer child.

7161
07:52:59,320 --> 07:53:02,500
Necros has like direct line of communication with the developers.

7162
07:53:03,360 --> 07:53:03,960
Oh shit.

7163
07:53:04,920 --> 07:53:06,040
I threw one of his games.

7164
07:53:06,500 --> 07:53:06,980
On accident.

7165
07:53:11,300 --> 07:53:12,740
On accident.

7166
07:53:13,260 --> 07:53:14,940
He's their favorite child.

7167
07:53:17,300 --> 07:53:19,120
Marvel Rivals, I'm sorry.

7168
07:53:21,240 --> 07:53:25,050
It was an accident.

7169
07:53:25,290 --> 07:53:26,950
It was 100% an accident.

7170
07:53:34,050 --> 07:53:36,130
Oh my god, where's my other support?

7171
07:53:44,180 --> 07:53:45,480
I'm coming back.

7172
07:53:45,560 --> 07:53:46,500
I'm coming back.

7173
07:53:47,560 --> 07:53:48,340
Oh.

7174
07:53:49,700 --> 07:53:51,220
Oh no.

7175
07:53:51,520 --> 07:53:53,580
Oh no.

7176
07:53:53,580 --> 07:53:55,980
They might do what we did to them.

7177
07:53:57,600 --> 07:53:58,960
No, no, surely not.

7178
07:53:59,720 --> 07:53:59,960
They might.

7179
07:54:00,760 --> 07:54:01,660
They might.

7180
07:54:03,100 --> 07:54:06,120
That was a very fast first point push.

7181
07:54:08,640 --> 07:54:09,980
They got lucky, don't worry.

7182
07:54:10,400 --> 07:54:11,220
You're right, you're right.

7183
07:54:18,960 --> 07:54:19,920
Oh my god, please.

7184
07:54:21,940 --> 07:54:23,200
These Loki clones are so annoying.

7185
07:54:25,000 --> 07:54:26,120
That's not fair.

7186
07:54:27,180 --> 07:54:28,840
I wanted to perform too.

7187
07:54:33,180 --> 07:54:34,300
Jesus Christ.

7188
07:54:34,780 --> 07:54:35,620
How much damage?

7189
07:54:40,800 --> 07:54:41,640
I'm serious.

7190
07:54:44,380 --> 07:54:46,380
Holy shit, did he just block that?

7191
07:54:47,800 --> 07:54:50,280
I just saw him block the fucking ult.

7192
07:54:51,040 --> 07:54:52,580
With like his own shield.

7193
07:54:52,700 --> 07:54:54,160
He flew to the Magneto ult.

7194
07:54:55,420 --> 07:54:56,940
Oh that's huge, that's huge, that's huge.

7195
07:54:57,460 --> 07:54:58,180
Oh.

7196
07:55:01,040 --> 07:55:02,240
Oh, they're unleashing hell.

7197
07:55:02,960 --> 07:55:03,220
Bye.

7198
07:55:12,680 --> 07:55:14,500
Oh, he killed two.

7199
07:55:20,180 --> 07:55:21,600
Alright, goodbye.

7200
07:55:30,360 --> 07:55:31,280
No!

7201
07:55:32,500 --> 07:55:33,300
Escape!

7202
07:55:34,800 --> 07:55:35,720
Escape!

7203
07:55:36,220 --> 07:55:39,440
I think they're pushing it as fast!

7204
07:55:40,520 --> 07:55:41,720
Don't worry.

7205
07:55:42,240 --> 07:55:44,220
Don't worry about it.

7206
07:55:44,220 --> 07:55:46,080
This kitty has two tanks!

7207
07:55:49,180 --> 07:55:50,560
We have this poor guy!

7208
07:55:50,580 --> 07:55:51,960
Maybe I pull out the Penny Parker.

7209
07:55:52,740 --> 07:55:53,160
Is it time?

7210
07:55:53,760 --> 07:55:57,800
We have this poor guy that's trying to fight for us.

7211
07:55:57,800 --> 07:55:58,580
Hold on, I got this.

7212
07:56:05,840 --> 07:56:07,580
Oh my god.

7213
07:56:09,080 --> 07:56:10,540
Oh my god.

7214
07:56:11,060 --> 07:56:13,620
How many hours do you have on Penny Parker?

7215
07:56:14,540 --> 07:56:15,580
At least...

7216
07:56:16,100 --> 07:56:17,880
Half of one.

7217
07:56:20,140 --> 07:56:20,520
Okay.

7218
07:56:20,740 --> 07:56:21,200
Don't worry.

7219
07:56:22,100 --> 07:56:22,720
Okay.

7220
07:56:23,200 --> 07:56:24,480
I'm not worrying.

7221
07:56:25,680 --> 07:56:28,180
Nyan Cat has...

7222
07:56:28,180 --> 07:56:29,000
Has died.

7223
07:56:29,520 --> 07:56:31,340
And then I have got Magneto'd.

7224
07:56:31,860 --> 07:56:33,840
I am a little worried now.

7225
07:56:34,440 --> 07:56:36,000
It's almost spider time.

7226
07:56:36,800 --> 07:56:37,620
Already?

7227
07:56:38,910 --> 07:56:39,320
Yes.

7228
07:56:40,740 --> 07:56:43,540
Okay, I almost have...

7229
07:56:43,540 --> 07:56:44,320
Oh, they...

7230
07:56:47,760 --> 07:56:49,040
We are Venom.

7231
07:56:51,000 --> 07:56:52,360
I will...

7232
07:56:52,880 --> 07:56:54,540
I'm here to dance.

7233
07:56:55,300 --> 07:56:56,560
I'm here to dance.

7234
07:56:56,740 --> 07:56:58,160
It's spider time.

7235
07:56:58,320 --> 07:56:59,660
They have other stuff too.

7236
07:57:00,720 --> 07:57:01,660
That's great.

7237
07:57:02,160 --> 07:57:04,000
Now we got to save...

7238
07:57:04,000 --> 07:57:05,960
We have zero alts for...

7239
07:57:05,960 --> 07:57:07,600
Three minutes defense.

7240
07:57:10,500 --> 07:57:11,180
But...

7241
07:57:11,180 --> 07:57:12,440
That's fine.

7242
07:57:13,700 --> 07:57:15,120
That's so fun.

7243
07:57:15,180 --> 07:57:16,100
It's okay, it's okay.

7244
07:57:16,180 --> 07:57:17,300
They don't have any either.

7245
07:57:18,020 --> 07:57:18,720
That's true.

7246
07:57:20,260 --> 07:57:22,140
Don't they have...

7247
07:57:22,140 --> 07:57:22,520
Low kill?

7248
07:57:23,260 --> 07:57:25,000
And also dancing?

7249
07:57:25,920 --> 07:57:26,960
And also...

7250
07:57:28,120 --> 07:57:29,780
Okay, they might have those.

7251
07:57:31,200 --> 07:57:31,880
But...

7252
07:57:31,880 --> 07:57:33,020
It will be okay.

7253
07:57:37,300 --> 07:57:37,980
Alright.

7254
07:57:38,740 --> 07:57:39,800
We are so chilling.

7255
07:57:40,980 --> 07:57:42,420
Oh dear god.

7256
07:57:42,870 --> 07:57:44,260
We are not chilling.

7257
07:57:50,200 --> 07:57:51,910
When does it end?

7258
07:57:54,480 --> 07:57:56,350
When does it end?

7259
07:58:00,510 --> 07:58:00,790
No!

7260
07:58:02,630 --> 07:58:04,290
Oh crap.

7261
07:58:04,950 --> 07:58:05,250
No!

7262
07:58:11,320 --> 07:58:13,290
My bad team.

7263
07:58:13,290 --> 07:58:15,630
I'm locked now.

7264
07:58:21,530 --> 07:58:22,810
I'm a little concerned.

7265
07:58:25,130 --> 07:58:26,490
I'm just...

7266
07:58:26,490 --> 07:58:28,050
I'm a little concerned.

7267
07:58:31,940 --> 07:58:33,640
I'm a little concerned.

7268
07:58:37,280 --> 07:58:39,860
Do you really think he's locked in?

7269
07:58:40,640 --> 07:58:41,420
I think he is.

7270
07:58:41,560 --> 07:58:42,200
I think he is.

7271
07:58:42,620 --> 07:58:44,560
Do you really think so, SK?

7272
07:58:46,340 --> 07:58:47,580
Yes, yes.

7273
07:58:52,420 --> 07:58:54,140
This is free.

7274
07:58:54,780 --> 07:58:55,220
Really?

7275
07:58:56,440 --> 07:58:58,060
Really with one tank?

7276
07:58:59,740 --> 07:59:01,900
It's okay, three defense is a good comp.

7277
07:59:05,560 --> 07:59:06,280
Okay.

7278
07:59:08,140 --> 07:59:08,860
Okay.

7279
07:59:08,860 --> 07:59:09,000
Okay.

7280
07:59:10,080 --> 07:59:12,620
I'll close my eyes and believe in you.

7281
07:59:12,940 --> 07:59:14,220
Don't worry, don't worry.

7282
07:59:14,340 --> 07:59:16,840
We have this in the palm of our hands.

7283
07:59:18,780 --> 07:59:21,380
I believe in you, but...

7284
07:59:22,480 --> 07:59:23,320
If it doesn't work...

7285
07:59:23,320 --> 07:59:25,760
Besides, if we lose, we can just keep queuing.

7286
07:59:27,720 --> 07:59:28,300
Okay.

7287
07:59:30,180 --> 07:59:30,760
Okay.

7288
07:59:36,540 --> 07:59:37,880
He's locked in.

7289
07:59:40,260 --> 07:59:42,800
Oh wait, that's a fucking NPC.

7290
07:59:43,380 --> 07:59:45,240
I was like, is that Spider-Man?

7291
07:59:45,740 --> 07:59:47,820
But it was an NPC Spider-Man.

7292
07:59:50,720 --> 07:59:53,160
That one confuses me every single time.

7293
07:59:53,660 --> 07:59:55,320
Yeah, that's the first time I saw her.

7294
07:59:56,820 --> 07:59:57,140
Yep.

7295
08:00:01,080 --> 08:00:01,440
Oh.

7296
08:00:01,780 --> 08:00:02,240
Oh no.

7297
08:00:02,840 --> 08:00:03,080
Oh.

7298
08:00:04,160 --> 08:00:04,600
Oh.

7299
08:00:04,960 --> 08:00:05,240
Oh.

7300
08:00:05,920 --> 08:00:06,480
Oh.

7301
08:00:07,980 --> 08:00:10,300
They already got a pick on us.

7302
08:00:14,360 --> 08:00:16,180
How come they get to have two tanks?

7303
08:00:16,680 --> 08:00:18,000
They should like delete one of them.

7304
08:00:23,520 --> 08:00:26,220
We should just like...

7305
08:00:26,220 --> 08:00:28,100
Lock that other tank stop.

7306
08:00:28,320 --> 08:00:28,660
Oh.

7307
08:00:29,420 --> 08:00:31,180
He died to the same guy.

7308
08:00:31,580 --> 08:00:32,440
Oh no.

7309
08:00:35,540 --> 08:00:37,060
It's literally the same guy.

7310
08:00:46,900 --> 08:00:48,080
Oh, tank might die though.

7311
08:00:48,260 --> 08:00:49,820
I have to do this.

7312
08:00:55,680 --> 08:00:56,040
So...

7313
08:01:01,060 --> 08:01:02,500
They're gonna come back with Luna's Snowball.

7314
08:01:02,560 --> 08:01:03,600
We have to kill them right now.

7315
08:01:05,840 --> 08:01:06,200
Okay.

7316
08:01:06,500 --> 08:01:06,660
Nice.

7317
08:01:07,760 --> 08:01:08,360
Let's go.

7318
08:01:08,780 --> 08:01:11,380
Okay, but our cloak and dagger are up to two for some fucking reason.

7319
08:01:11,540 --> 08:01:12,180
I don't know why.

7320
08:01:12,620 --> 08:01:13,240
Oh no.

7321
08:01:13,400 --> 08:01:14,600
I don't know why he did that.

7322
08:01:14,760 --> 08:01:15,720
Why did you do that?

7323
08:01:15,720 --> 08:01:17,100
We were gonna win that point.

7324
08:01:30,300 --> 08:01:33,540
What if she dies by the Hanzo arrow again?

7325
08:01:41,500 --> 08:01:41,980
I...

7326
08:01:41,980 --> 08:01:43,740
I got Hanzo'd.

7327
08:01:43,980 --> 08:01:46,340
Hella still doesn't have her ult yet by the way.

7328
08:01:49,140 --> 08:01:50,300
She's dead.

7329
08:01:50,720 --> 08:01:51,840
She died.

7330
08:01:53,080 --> 08:01:54,460
She died.

7331
08:01:54,740 --> 08:01:56,340
She didn't even get a chance to use it.

7332
08:01:56,440 --> 08:01:57,300
She died.

7333
08:01:59,860 --> 08:02:01,500
She died.

7334
08:02:02,360 --> 08:02:03,180
No!

7335
08:02:04,600 --> 08:02:05,120
Oh.

7336
08:02:07,160 --> 08:02:10,300
She died before she could use it.

7337
08:02:11,260 --> 08:02:13,800
If we had...

7338
08:02:13,800 --> 08:02:15,220
Cloak and dagger ult there.

7339
08:02:17,140 --> 08:02:17,820
Oh.

7340
08:02:17,900 --> 08:02:19,740
Oh my god!

7341
08:02:19,960 --> 08:02:21,980
The fat figures are us!

7342
08:02:22,520 --> 08:02:23,380
Oh god.

7343
08:02:28,620 --> 08:02:30,080
I'm gonna report them.

7344
08:02:32,600 --> 08:02:33,880
Oh, I can't report them.

7345
08:02:33,880 --> 08:02:34,980
I have to report them after the game.

7346
08:02:39,340 --> 08:02:40,960
We got this.

7347
08:02:42,500 --> 08:02:44,260
We're throwing my game.

7348
08:02:44,420 --> 08:02:45,040
That's it.

7349
08:02:49,560 --> 08:02:50,040
Yeah.

7350
08:02:51,940 --> 08:02:53,280
Bro is not locked in.

7351
08:02:54,940 --> 08:02:56,480
Bro is not locked in.

7352
08:02:56,580 --> 08:02:58,820
You get reported if you don't lock in.

7353
08:02:59,460 --> 08:03:00,860
Never meet your fucking heroes.

7354
08:03:02,100 --> 08:03:02,480
Don't worry.

7355
08:03:03,480 --> 08:03:05,360
My Penny Parker is fucking nasty.

7356
08:03:06,980 --> 08:03:08,740
Alright, I'll give you the orb.

7357
08:03:09,900 --> 08:03:12,300
Actually no, I'll give the orb to our other tank.

7358
08:03:12,460 --> 08:03:15,460
So if you tank too much then you...

7359
08:03:15,460 --> 08:03:17,480
Then like, he gets the heals.

7360
08:03:19,320 --> 08:03:23,260
Cause I have a feeling you might be the one that's gonna take the most damage.

7361
08:03:24,200 --> 08:03:25,260
Yeah, yeah.

7362
08:03:26,620 --> 08:03:28,020
Careful of the Hawkeye.

7363
08:03:42,860 --> 08:03:43,720
Oh my god.

7364
08:03:47,220 --> 08:03:49,640
This Punisher is stressing me out.

7365
08:03:52,180 --> 08:03:53,460
Oh, nice.

7366
08:04:10,210 --> 08:04:11,330
Punisher, please.

7367
08:04:12,610 --> 08:04:15,450
Don't let them have too much free space though.

7368
08:04:17,090 --> 08:04:19,190
How is he dead again?

7369
08:04:21,910 --> 08:04:23,670
That's a very good question.

7370
08:04:24,950 --> 08:04:25,750
Magneto's one.

7371
08:04:26,270 --> 08:04:26,790
No!

7372
08:04:27,690 --> 08:04:28,870
He got me out!

7373
08:04:38,620 --> 08:04:39,880
God damn it.

7374
08:04:40,160 --> 08:04:41,620
He's throwing so hard.

7375
08:04:43,320 --> 08:04:44,440
It's okay.

7376
08:04:45,700 --> 08:04:46,900
If we all...

7377
08:04:46,900 --> 08:04:48,060
I have my ult.

7378
08:04:49,520 --> 08:04:51,360
I can probably...

7379
08:04:51,360 --> 08:04:51,680
I can touch.

7380
08:04:52,160 --> 08:04:54,160
Wait, Cloak used her ult already?

7381
08:04:54,940 --> 08:04:55,880
For what?

7382
08:04:56,100 --> 08:04:56,700
Did I touch?

7383
08:04:57,160 --> 08:04:57,840
I'm touching.

7384
08:04:59,860 --> 08:05:01,000
It's spider time.

7385
08:05:01,680 --> 08:05:03,420
Oh shit, it's spider time?

7386
08:05:04,760 --> 08:05:05,080
I'm dead.

7387
08:05:07,000 --> 08:05:07,560
I'm dead.

7388
08:05:07,740 --> 08:05:09,340
I got Magneto ulted.

7389
08:05:09,840 --> 08:05:10,480
Frick.

7390
08:05:12,240 --> 08:05:14,120
I got Magneto ulted.

7391
08:05:15,140 --> 08:05:16,380
We just gotta...

7392
08:05:16,380 --> 08:05:17,120
I'm coming back.

7393
08:05:17,180 --> 08:05:17,920
I'm coming back though.

7394
08:05:18,040 --> 08:05:19,220
We have another fight.

7395
08:05:26,010 --> 08:05:26,490
Wait.

7396
08:05:28,230 --> 08:05:28,710
What?

7397
08:05:35,940 --> 08:05:36,420
Okay.

7398
08:05:37,060 --> 08:05:37,940
Alright, here we go.

7399
08:05:42,790 --> 08:05:43,670
I'm heading over.

7400
08:05:44,150 --> 08:05:45,590
I'm heading over to you.

7401
08:05:54,440 --> 08:05:55,440
We used way too many ults.

7402
08:05:55,840 --> 08:05:57,580
Yes, yes, we did it!

7403
08:05:57,820 --> 08:05:58,740
Oh my god.

7404
08:05:59,260 --> 08:06:00,400
Oh my god.

7405
08:06:00,400 --> 08:06:02,340
We did it!

7406
08:06:03,040 --> 08:06:03,660
We're free!

7407
08:06:04,160 --> 08:06:06,180
Not there!

7408
08:06:08,200 --> 08:06:09,080
They docked it!

7409
08:06:09,220 --> 08:06:10,040
Oh my god!

7410
08:06:10,860 --> 08:06:12,520
We actually did it!

7411
08:06:13,580 --> 08:06:14,660
We're free!

7412
08:06:15,420 --> 08:06:16,340
We're free!

7413
08:06:16,620 --> 08:06:17,480
Oh my god!

7414
08:06:19,640 --> 08:06:20,860
Oh my god!

7415
08:06:20,920 --> 08:06:22,060
We're actually free!

7416
08:06:22,660 --> 08:06:23,980
For today, guys.

7417
08:06:24,480 --> 08:06:25,260
Don't think it's over.

7418
08:06:25,560 --> 08:06:26,220
For today.

7419
08:06:26,560 --> 08:06:29,200
Do I get the points?

7420
08:06:29,480 --> 08:06:30,820
My game crashed just then.

7421
08:06:31,820 --> 08:06:33,020
I think you do.

7422
08:06:33,280 --> 08:06:34,200
Surely you get the points.

7423
08:06:34,600 --> 08:06:36,260
Surely you get the points.

7424
08:06:36,860 --> 08:06:38,020
There's no way.

7425
08:06:38,220 --> 08:06:39,280
There's no way.

7426
08:06:41,860 --> 08:06:43,360
No, there's no way.

7427
08:06:45,220 --> 08:06:46,420
There's no way.

7428
08:06:48,260 --> 08:06:49,300
There's no way.

7429
08:06:49,740 --> 08:06:51,220
Do you want me to tell you if you got the points?

7430
08:06:51,600 --> 08:06:52,720
I didn't, did I?

7431
08:06:55,420 --> 08:06:56,460
I didn't.

7432
08:06:56,460 --> 08:06:58,420
I didn't get the points, right?

7433
08:06:58,560 --> 08:06:59,420
Toki, you got the points.

7434
08:06:59,680 --> 08:07:00,500
We're good.

7435
08:07:01,120 --> 08:07:02,860
Thank god!

7436
08:07:03,660 --> 08:07:04,380
We're free!

7437
08:07:04,900 --> 08:07:06,160
I'm diamond 3!

7438
08:07:09,170 --> 08:07:11,490
Oh my god, I'm actually diamond 3!

7439
08:07:12,510 --> 08:07:13,030
Shit!

7440
08:07:13,830 --> 08:07:14,870
I need to see it.

7441
08:07:15,790 --> 08:07:17,190
Don't, I need to see it.

7442
08:07:17,210 --> 08:07:19,010
All 500 is diamond 2 now.

7443
08:07:19,310 --> 08:07:20,610
I'm gonna fucking...

7444
08:07:21,690 --> 08:07:22,530
I'm gonna...

7445
08:07:23,510 --> 08:07:25,410
It's gonna be high diamond 2.

7446
08:07:25,930 --> 08:07:27,030
It's tomorrow.

7447
08:07:27,450 --> 08:07:29,030
I just need a win.

7448
08:07:29,270 --> 08:07:31,930
I just need it so that...

7449
08:07:31,930 --> 08:07:32,730
Nothing bad...

7450
08:07:32,730 --> 08:07:34,910
Oh my god, I can't even fucking see my lobby anymore.

7451
08:07:35,250 --> 08:07:38,530
I didn't restart my PC to be able to see my game.

7452
08:07:40,030 --> 08:07:40,710
It's okay.

7453
08:07:42,570 --> 08:07:43,430
We did it.

7454
08:07:43,570 --> 08:07:44,110
Diamond 3.

7455
08:07:45,070 --> 08:07:46,630
Diamond 2 is top 500.

7456
08:07:47,270 --> 08:07:48,590
We're always just...

7457
08:07:48,590 --> 08:07:50,350
We're always just 1.

7458
08:07:50,870 --> 08:07:53,710
Just 1 rank away.

7459
08:07:55,130 --> 08:07:57,730
Literally, it won't become diamond 1 tomorrow, surely.

7460
08:07:58,150 --> 08:07:58,610
Tomorrow.

7461
08:07:59,490 --> 08:08:00,170
Guys.

7462
08:08:00,950 --> 08:08:02,330
Guys, if...

7463
08:08:02,330 --> 08:08:03,330
Surefour and I...

7464
08:08:03,330 --> 08:08:04,570
Because he's playing earlier, guys.

7465
08:08:04,670 --> 08:08:07,830
If Surefour and I get it before my announcement stream...

7466
08:08:07,830 --> 08:08:09,990
Then we keep the announcement stream chat.

7467
08:08:10,790 --> 08:08:12,750
But if we don't...

7468
08:08:12,750 --> 08:08:14,970
Get ready for more Marvel rivals.

7469
08:08:15,330 --> 08:08:19,230
Get ready for more Marvel rivals.

7470
08:08:20,070 --> 08:08:20,330
Get ready for more Marvel rivals.

7471
08:08:20,330 --> 08:08:22,850
If we don't...

7472
08:08:26,530 --> 08:08:27,950
Oh my god, I can't even...

7473
08:08:27,950 --> 08:08:29,110
Wait, how do you know I'm diamond?

7474
08:08:29,270 --> 08:08:30,270
Wait, how do you know I'm diamond?

7475
08:08:31,230 --> 08:08:33,190
You're still in my party.

7476
08:08:33,610 --> 08:08:34,570
Oh, and it said diamond?

7477
08:08:35,390 --> 08:08:35,750
Yep.

7478
08:08:36,430 --> 08:08:38,750
Okay, can you take a screenshot of it for me?

7479
08:08:39,470 --> 08:08:40,390
Yeah, I got you.

7480
08:08:40,570 --> 08:08:43,190
Can you take a screenshot and I'll post it on Twitter live?

7481
08:08:46,970 --> 08:08:48,930
Wait, you didn't get to watch the rank though.

7482
08:08:48,930 --> 08:08:49,890
I didn't.

7483
08:08:50,550 --> 08:08:53,730
I crashed when I had to watch this fucking thing.

7484
08:08:54,410 --> 08:08:56,290
This is the best screenshot I can get.

7485
08:08:56,570 --> 08:08:57,830
Hold on, hold on.

7486
08:09:01,720 --> 08:09:03,140
You're diamond 3, right?

7487
08:09:05,740 --> 08:09:06,260
Yep.

7488
08:09:06,780 --> 08:09:08,840
Can you take a picture of your diamond 3?

7489
08:09:09,520 --> 08:09:10,840
Just the thing.

7490
08:09:11,220 --> 08:09:12,860
And then I'll just post that.

7491
08:09:12,880 --> 08:09:13,300
The big one?

7492
08:09:13,460 --> 08:09:14,680
Yeah, the big one.

7493
08:09:15,620 --> 08:09:20,340
And then I'll live vicariously through your picture of the diamond 3.

7494
08:09:21,260 --> 08:09:22,780
I'm gonna use that.

7495
08:09:26,240 --> 08:09:28,600
Wait, let me take a better centered one.

7496
08:09:30,400 --> 08:09:32,360
That's my diamond 3.

7497
08:09:33,620 --> 08:09:34,840
Guys, look.

7498
08:09:35,280 --> 08:09:37,180
There you go, that one's good.

7499
08:09:37,340 --> 08:09:39,080
I'm gonna post that on Twitter right now.

7500
08:09:39,420 --> 08:09:41,480
No top 500 today.

7501
08:09:42,100 --> 08:09:45,060
But we made it to diamond 3.

7502
08:09:45,420 --> 08:09:47,880
Diamond 2 is top 500.

7503
08:09:50,220 --> 08:09:52,260
We're going into more.

7504
08:09:52,260 --> 08:09:53,740
Spiraling into insanity.

7505
08:10:00,910 --> 08:10:01,490
Okay.

7506
08:10:01,830 --> 08:10:03,110
We had a good win streak.

7507
08:10:03,290 --> 08:10:07,290
We were like 5 and 2 at the end.

7508
08:10:07,630 --> 08:10:09,090
Yeah, but you saw what happened.

7509
08:10:09,210 --> 08:10:10,310
Oh, wait.

7510
08:10:10,510 --> 08:10:13,290
I didn't realize we went on a 6 loss streak before that.

7511
08:10:13,370 --> 08:10:14,930
You saw what happened.

7512
08:10:15,910 --> 08:10:16,610
You saw.

7513
08:10:17,130 --> 08:10:17,370
Yeah.

7514
08:10:19,050 --> 08:10:19,490
Yeah.

7515
08:10:24,110 --> 08:10:24,990
GGs, SK.

7516
08:10:25,770 --> 08:10:26,850
GGs, have a good night.

7517
08:10:27,190 --> 08:10:28,690
You too, go sleep.

7518
08:10:29,350 --> 08:10:32,250
I have to go back to work after this.

7519
08:10:32,750 --> 08:10:34,310
Oh my god, good luck.

7520
08:10:34,550 --> 08:10:34,990
GGs.

7521
08:10:35,010 --> 08:10:36,350
Okay, bye bye.

7522
08:10:39,250 --> 08:10:45,030
Guys, something I thought would take 4-5 hours is now 8 hour mark.

7523
08:10:45,350 --> 08:10:46,610
And I have to go back to work.

7524
08:10:47,130 --> 08:10:48,130
But...

7525
08:10:48,130 --> 08:10:50,510
Thank you everybody for watching.

7526
08:10:51,290 --> 08:10:52,830
We go again tomorrow.

7527
08:10:53,430 --> 08:10:55,430
If I get top 500...

7528
08:10:56,810 --> 08:10:57,250
Before...

7529
08:10:58,670 --> 08:10:59,550
Before...

7530
08:10:59,550 --> 08:11:00,950
The...

7531
08:11:00,950 --> 08:11:02,410
Before...

7532
08:11:02,410 --> 08:11:04,350
My announcement, you're free.

7533
08:11:04,550 --> 08:11:05,470
You're freed.

7534
08:11:05,950 --> 08:11:08,010
But if we don't...

7535
08:11:08,010 --> 08:11:10,650
It's my revivals and announcement.

7536
08:11:17,550 --> 08:11:19,450
Have fun, everybody.

7537
08:11:19,730 --> 08:11:21,110
We'll see you tomorrow.

7538
08:11:22,430 --> 08:11:23,930
As always, everybody.

7539
08:11:24,090 --> 08:11:25,110
Stay hydrated.

7540
08:11:26,050 --> 08:11:26,850
Posture check.

7541
08:11:27,110 --> 08:11:29,230
Get up and move around and get that blood flowing.

7542
08:11:29,530 --> 08:11:31,690
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

7543
08:11:31,930 --> 08:11:33,790
Guys, you deserve it.

7544
08:11:34,270 --> 08:11:35,090
Honk honk.

7545
08:11:35,190 --> 08:11:36,510
I'll see you guys next time.

7546
08:11:36,750 --> 08:11:37,270
Bye.

7547
08:11:38,490 --> 08:11:39,550
Honk sadly.

7548
08:11:41,350 --> 08:11:41,930
Honk.

7549
08:11:42,050 --> 08:11:42,630
Honk honk.
