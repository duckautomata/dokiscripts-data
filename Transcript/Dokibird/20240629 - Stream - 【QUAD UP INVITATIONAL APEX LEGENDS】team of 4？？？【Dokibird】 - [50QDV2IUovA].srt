1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280
Melani.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,240
It's Melani but you can just say Mel.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,160
Oh Mel.

4
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:03,760
Okay I got you.

5
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,900
She is playing Lifeline.

6
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,680
And then what's left?

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,720
I don't know.

8
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,160
Other than...

9
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,260
We got Watson and Bloodhound.

10
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,640
Yeah yeah yeah.

11
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,020
I can play Bloodhound.

12
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,460
Okay now I can do Watson.

13
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,960
That's not that important.

14
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,640
As long as you're playing up all those fences.

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,500
Yeah yeah as long as I'm fence bitch I'm fine.

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,820
I can do that.

17
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,460
Okay perfect.

18
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,440
Alright guys.

19
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,400
We're here!

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,780
I muted myself.

21
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,580
I need to get a shortcut for muting.

22
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,260
I learned on these tournaments these guys just talk to their chat.

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,540
They don't have actual...

24
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Does that mean that I'm insane?

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,960
I need to get used to it because a lot of them they talk to their chat instead of talking to the team.

26
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,800
And I'm so not used to it.

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm not used to that.

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,040
Bro they give the Akasupa.

29
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:00,820
Thank you.

30
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,920
Alright give me... there was no intro because we were talking about strats.

31
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,660
So I had to like figure something out.

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,720
I had to like let you guys in because we were talking about strats.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,480
I wasn't even the latest person.

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,540
Look at team 11.

35
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,660
They're missing team 11 and team 9.

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,820
I'm not even the latest person.

37
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,660
How the fuck do you do shortcuts?

38
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Oh keybinds.

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,360
What's a good button for key... guys.

40
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,140
What's a good button for... I don't even know what button to use to mute people.

41
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,020
Or like mute myself.

42
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,800
Oh my god how do you do this?

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,940
I tried to...

44
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,140
Where's the mute?

45
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,540
How do I fucking... oh toggle mute.

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,920
Control shift M.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,300
Okay we are not doing that.

48
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,800
That's way too much.

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,000
Um...

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,160
What is a button that's not used too much?

51
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,640
Is 8 used for anything?

52
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,980
Is 8 used for anything?

53
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,260
I don't know.

54
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,720
What do I...

55
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,520
Control shift... okay we're just gonna learn control shift M.

56
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,460
Yeah bro my ch...

57
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,560
Okay okay I'm looking at the discord channel.

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,500
And our entire channel...

59
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,300
Our entire channel of people is all muted.

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,140
Nobody wants to mute me.

61
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,400
Nobody wants to talk to anybody.

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Everybody's muted.

63
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,520
Bro.

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,200
Oh my god everybody.

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,120
Oh my god.

66
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,400
Bro I'm looking...

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm not gonna dox... obviously I'm not gonna dox the fucking discord names.

68
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,840
But like it's like mute mute mute mute mute mute mute mute.

69
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,060
Like every other channel.

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,860
Every channel is like mute mute mute.

71
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,460
And then one guy's not muted.

72
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,400
And then...

73
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,720
Timmy's channel they're all actually talking to each other.

74
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,300
Oh my god.

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,880
Timmy and Naughty and Reptar.

76
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,620
Like team 8, 7, and 5 are actually talking to each other.

77
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,080
That's crazy.

78
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,880
I think I cooked something up.

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,160
What's up?

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,320
What if we do...

81
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,820
What if we do Mel on Bang?

82
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,380
Doki you on...

83
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,540
You're still gonna be on Watson?

84
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,260
Sweet.

85
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,440
Sweet.

86
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,920
And then...

87
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,780
I can play Path.

88
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Okay.

89
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,580
And then...

90
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,340
I just did the shortcut guys.

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,860
What else do we play?

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,580
I just did the fucking shortcut.

93
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,100
Do we still want Bloodhound or Sands?

94
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,440
Yeah like I'm like kinda thinking Bloodhound might not even be that worth it.

95
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,960
Yeah I mean if you smoke and I'm in my ult I can't see shit.

96
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,020
Yeah so like what as the fourth though?

97
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,620
Bang, Lifeline, Path.

98
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,700
All these strats.

99
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Wait wait wait.

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,340
If you're gonna go to Newcastle, if you're gonna go...

101
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,080
If you're gonna get off Bang you should just play like Newcastle or Lifeline.

102
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,640
So Lifeline?

103
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,580
I don't know what...

104
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,320
I haven't touched Apex in a while guys.

105
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,440
Oh yeah then it would be you on Lifeline.

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm just gonna exist.

107
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm like...

108
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,820
I'm like thinking...

109
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,220
How the mighty have fallen.

110
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,960
Pathfinder might be pretty goaded for this.

111
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,120
So I fall...

112
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,540
There hasn't been like an engaging FPS games in so long.

113
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:15,560
And then no Sands.

114
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,100
I don't think Sands are gonna really be that important in like 4v4s.

115
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Like we're gonna fucking know this.

116
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,660
I think we're gonna have a lot of people where people are.

117
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,020
You know?

118
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,800
Like it's literally...

119
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,400
It's like...

120
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,740
There's a lot of people.

121
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,480
Massive squads.

122
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,280
There's so many people.

123
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,920
There's 15 teams and there's 4 people for each team.

124
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,260
I think Sands will be that important.

125
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,500
Bring up the Discord.

126
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160
Max out Melanie and bring up Bree.

127
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,600
OK.

128
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,680
Max out Melanie.

129
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,040
Bring up Bree.

130
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,120
Are you excited?

131
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,140
Sound guy to do sound check every two games?

132
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,420
I'm so excited.

133
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,340
All right.

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
Bringing it up right now.

135
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,900
All right.

136
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,340
Here we go.

137
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,540
All right.

138
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,020
I did it.

139
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,080
I did it.

140
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:57,140
Anyway, so every two games, every two games, we are, we're going to swap teams.

141
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,560
It's gonna be randomized teams.

142
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,100
So, by the way, I participated, okay, this is on me.

143
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:13,120
I participated in a lot of Tempo's tournaments, but I haven't got paid for one of them because I've yet to do the tax forms.

144
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,600
I was like, wait, have I been paid yet?

145
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,040
Tempo's like, didn't do the tax forms.

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,380
I've been telling you to do the goddamn tax forms for months, Doki.

147
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,180
We can't pay you because you still haven't done the tax forms.

148
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,640
I was like, oh shit.

149
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,600
My bad.

150
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,860
But then like, a couple of months later, I'd just be like, hey, have I been paid yet?

151
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,960
And Tempo's just like, please, we sent you the tax forms.

152
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,940
So, anyway, I should get, I should do the tax forms soon.

153
00:05:51,100 --> 00:06:06,220
I should do the tax forms for, for, it's because, okay, no, I do my taxes, but I can't receive any of my tournament winnings from Apex because I keep forgetting to do the main tax form to receive the tournament earnings.

154
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,340
I can't get tax evasions if I don't receive the money.

155
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,760
So, so I keep forgetting, I keep forgetting to do them.

156
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,320
And because of that, I have yet to be paid.

157
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,240
I've been doing this for like free so far.

158
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:35,720
That's like at least like, I swear, I think that's at least $10,000 that Tempo's been holding on to for me.

159
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,840
Oh my god, I'm a mess.

160
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,100
Tempo's literally holding 10k from me right now.

161
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,080
Just like 10k but mới 10k back in the day.

162
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,140
Okay,

163
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,920
step by step, guys.

164
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,060
We're slowly, very slowly fixing, fixing step.

165
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,020
Little, little...

166
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,880
Hey,

167
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,200
at least I'm not committing tax fraud.

168
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,780
I'm just not receiving the money.

169
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,800
I have an accountant.

170
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,200
I just...

171
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,780
The issue is that all I need to do is forward the form.

172
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,160
I'm making this more worse for me.

173
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,060
That is my only issue.

174
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,480
I just haven't forwarded the form to my accountant.

175
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,220
That... look.

176
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,300
That's a lot of buttons to press, guys.

177
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,040
That's a lot of buttons to press.

178
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,840
Chat.

179
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,260
So, it's not my fault.

180
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,720
It's just a lot.

181
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,480
That's a lot of buttons.

182
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,140
Please, we're worried.

183
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,220
Thank you for the super chat.

184
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,920
Thank you, thank you.

185
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,020
Speaking of engaging FPS games, Valve just banned like a thousand of the cheaters and bots in TF2.

186
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,460
And the game is finally playable after years.

187
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,060
It's amazing.

188
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,040
Thank you for the super chat.

189
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,560
Thank you, thank you.

190
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,660
I don't think there's a whole competitive scene for TF2 anymore.

191
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,660
You can say that it used to, but there's not really much of a competitive scene.

192
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,020
I think like... I don't know.

193
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,860
I'm down to come back to Apex again in the future.

194
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:36,520
It's just that it feels like... definitely... I was talking to Ditto and like we were like, you know, crying about the lack of engaging FPS... like new FPS games and stuff.

195
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,600
Ditto was like, oh, you should play the finals again.

196
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,440
Because apparently the finals got better.

197
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,720
But I feel like... yeah, it might be better.

198
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,300
But I feel like there's no competitive scene.

199
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,140
I just like games with a competitive scene because it just makes it much more... I guess like...

200
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,420
It just makes it much more... like there's like a worth to playing it.

201
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,420
I know there's like leaderboards, there's like top 500 for finals.

202
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,280
But... you can't really flex it.

203
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,000
If you tell somebody, I'm top 500 in the finals, they'll be like, what?

204
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,540
It's just... look, I need the ego boost.

205
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,360
Like, what's the point if I can't flex that shit, you know?

206
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:27,700
What's the point if I can be like, I'm top 500 in something and then they'll be like, what?

207
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,530
Esports seems to be dying in general.

208
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,210
It's dying because a lot of people... a lot of boosts.

209
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:45,810
Boomers who know nothing about esports are like funding a lot of money into the esports scene.

210
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,170
And then now they're pulling out because they realize like, wait, the investments were never worth it.

211
00:09:51,270 --> 00:10:01,830
So because of that, a lot of the esports companies are dying now because they got a lot of boomers that were like, wow, let me commit $10 billion to the Overwatch League and buy a spot.

212
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,510
And like, what was it?

213
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,190
There was like football teams, like football owners that were like, Overwatch League.

214
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,110
It's going to be the next NFL.

215
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,350
Let me invest like $10 billion into getting a spot for Los Angeles.

216
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,170
And then... sorry, Los Angeles.

217
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,170
I don't know.

218
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:33,010
And now they're like pulling out the investment and they're now scared to invest in esports because they're just like, oh, wait, maybe that wasn't a good idea.

219
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,190
Now I'm never going to invest ever again because of that one time when I invested in this watch.

220
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,250
I invested in one thing and it wasn't worth it.

221
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,670
So that's why like, that's why esports is dying.

222
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:51,810
It's not because of like, oh, it's because like over the years, it's people were just like, no.

223
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,830
Also, like my chat's dead and I don't know how to fix it.

224
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,350
I don't know.

225
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,730
Oh, there you go.

226
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,490
I fixed it.

227
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,410
JK, I knew how to fix it.

228
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,310
It can be profitable.

229
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,390
You just can't.

230
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,190
Like, you just have to like invest smartly into things.

231
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,430
You can't just chuck a million dollars into something and then just be...

232
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,870
And then also there was never...

233
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,870
There's no like oversight.

234
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,750
That's...

235
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,910
This is oversight esports, by the way.

236
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,810
This tournament is like run by oversight.

237
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,110
But there's no like...

238
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,150
There's no...

239
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,730
What's the word?

240
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:35,710
There's no like anybody like actually like inspecting and like monitoring where the money is going to.

241
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:36,850
And...

242
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,170
Because like people would be like...

243
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,970
I'm going to chuck 20 billion into TSM.

244
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,470
And I want you to rename your org name to FTX.

245
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,030
Sorry.

246
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,210
It's not too soon.

247
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,970
He's in jail now.

248
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:59,490
And TSM, you can spend as much money as you want on anything you want with that 20 billion dollars.

249
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,670
And because of that, like they fucked up because...

250
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,730
Because like, you know, they didn't monitor where the money was spent and it was actually a scam in the end.

251
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,630
Yeah.

252
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,270
I'm ready.

253
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,570
I got the comp.

254
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:11,850
Yeah.

255
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:12,570
I got the comp.

256
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,330
I got the juice.

257
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,050
Are you changing it?

258
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,050
Yeah, we're...

259
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,210
I got the juice.

260
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,070
We're saying everything the same, but I'm going to play Newcastle instead of Path.

261
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,470
Lifeline, Newcastle, Perth.

262
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,770
Wait, are they like contesting for stuff like...

263
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,130
Bri, Bri, Bri, you're going to play Lifeline.

264
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,950
You're going to play Lifeline.

265
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

266
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,410
Who the fuck is Watson?

267
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,250
Oh, there she is.

268
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,100
Guys, we have a problem.

269
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,820
I have to tab to my Discord to mute my Discord.

270
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,280
We have a problem.

271
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,020
All right.

272
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
We're landing at Rig and Basin.

273
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,560
I'll just like tell you guys where to land when we drop.

274
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,880
I don't think we're contested, so we shouldn't have to fight anyone.

275
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,220
Yay.

276
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,900
That's great to know.

277
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,060
Oh, yeah.

278
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,040
Yeah, I think we're good.

279
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,900
Oh, my God.

280
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,400
It's King's Canyon, the smallest fucking map?

281
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,040
There's two on this first, yeah.

282
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,440
Oh, my God.

283
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,220
With four players per team.

284
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,800
Okay, this is...

285
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,460
This is going to be a massacre.

286
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:17,780
All right.

287
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,240
Um...

288
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,220
You want to go?

289
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,760
Mel, you're going to land towards Basin.

290
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,400
Here, drop us.

291
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,680
I'm going to go Basin with Mel and then someone land...

292
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,440
Someone land here.

293
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,800
Okay, I'll land over here.

294
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,960
And then someone land at the actual like Rig.

295
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,300
All right.

296
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,080
I'll land here then.

297
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,200
Okay.

298
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,500
Yay.

299
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,920
I'm going to go like far side of here.

300
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,020
Ooh.

301
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,730
Guys, I'm fucked.

302
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,690
This team doesn't talk.

303
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,770
Oh, my God.

304
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,610
Oh, my God.

305
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,390
Oh, let's hope they don't require me to communicate.

306
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,970
I'm fucked.

307
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,770
I don't...

308
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,410
I don't remember how to socialize.

309
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,270
I don't...

310
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,630
It's okay.

311
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,910
I have no input.

312
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,290
I have no input to give to these people at the moment.

313
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,590
I literally just exist.

314
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:18,710
So, I'm going to...

315
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,210
It's okay guys.

316
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,230
We will tap back.

317
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:25,990
We will unmute.

318
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,550
How do you make friends again?

319
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,610
Oh my god I haven't done this in so long.

320
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,450
I'm so...

321
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,770
I'm so... shit I'm a mess.

322
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,970
I'm a fucking mess right now.

323
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,130
I don't know how to communicate with strangers.

324
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,250
I... guys I used to be so good at this.

325
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,630
I don't know.

326
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,670
I used to be so good at interacting with strangers.

327
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,750
I used to be so good at interacting with strangers.

328
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,390
Okay I actually don't need that.

329
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,430
I don't know what to run.

330
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,930
I don't even know what's good anymore.

331
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:01,810
I'm so...

332
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,750
Okay... I guess I'm heading over to...

333
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,230
Looking for a Havoc.

334
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,370
And also...

335
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,270
I need Hemlock.

336
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,330
Okay.

337
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:17,530
Okay.

338
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,470
Havoc and Hemlock.

339
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,510
Ooh!

340
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,390
And...

341
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,030
Alright guys.

342
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,450
I'm gonna try it.

343
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:27,870
I'm gonna...

344
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,510
I'm gonna interact.

345
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,470
I'm gonna interact.

346
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,270
Let's hope I don't get shot when I tap out.

347
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,710
Let's hope I don't get shot when I tap out.

348
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,550
Are we supposed to head to you, Dropped?

349
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,330
Yeah.

350
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,670
You guys can just like loot towards me.

351
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,110
Alright.

352
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,510
Cool.

353
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,550
You're gonna go hit that console.

354
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,090
Doki.

355
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:48,430
Where the fuck?

356
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:48,650
Oh.

357
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,050
Where am I?

358
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,010
Oh my god that's so far.

359
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,370
Okay.

360
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,570
Heading over.

361
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,890
Yeah you're good.

362
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,150
Doki can you carry the ultimate?

363
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,110
Or...

364
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,730
Yeah I can.

365
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,290
I have space.

366
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,130
Where is it?

367
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,190
I think that's...

368
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,050
Yeah yeah yeah.

369
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,850
Should I do the fast revive or the attack cooldown?

370
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,350
So I have my drone up then.

371
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,270
Do fast revive.

372
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,390
What about me?

373
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,590
Do I get revive or falling?

374
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,890
You do the Arc Star one.

375
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,410
Alright.

376
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,730
Here we go.

377
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:27,850
Ooh.

378
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,750
What do you think end zone's gonna be?

379
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,930
This will probably just end towards the map room.

380
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,450
So... Oh my god.

381
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,330
That's so far.

382
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:36,910
We're gonna like...

383
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,130
Kinda rotate.

384
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:39,650
Yeah.

385
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,430
Hmm.

386
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,370
Oh I think we're...

387
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,510
I'm thinking we go towards... I'm thinking we go towards labs.

388
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,210
We wanna get to purple.

389
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,630
So that way um...

390
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,750
We can get Brie her...

391
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:51,810
Gold res.

392
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,630
Wait.

393
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,270
A team died already?

394
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:54,570
How?

395
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,150
How did a team really die?

396
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,870
It was Hal's team.

397
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,410
Okay we're better than Hal.

398
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,830
No matter what.

399
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,650
We're better than Hal.

400
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,710
That's crazy.

401
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,310
Okay.

402
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,610
I'll carry.

403
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,550
Oh there's a hemlock.

404
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,720
Let's see.

405
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,920
Alright we have four evacs.

406
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,080
Alright.

407
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,920
That's fucking good.

408
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:31,280
Yeah.

409
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,880
We should um... look to get this evo harv and then hit this assault bin and then we should all be perp off of those too.

410
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,220
Yeah.

411
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,700
Yeah!

412
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,800
And then once we do that we can probably uh...

413
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,860
Hit the labs portal and like fly and take something.

414
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,460
Alright.

415
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,780
Raise that.

416
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,840
We hear nothing right now.

417
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,160
I hear shots on the right.

418
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,220
I hear shots on the west.

419
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,020
I think they're fighting over there on the west.

420
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,200
Oh wait I see I see there's a Bangalore ult.

421
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,280
And a Gibby ult.

422
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:01,880
Yeah.

423
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,540
Go get that assault bin Mel.

424
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,940
Are we gonna fight them or are we just gonna fly away?

425
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,320
Nah.

426
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,560
It's only placement so like...

427
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,850
Wait what placement do you get money?

428
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,750
I don't remember.

429
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,910
Top six.

430
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,310
Top six?

431
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:16,770
Okay.

432
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,050
That's easy.

433
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,010
Yeah I see that.

434
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,690
Set that assault bin.

435
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,750
We're gonna go to labs after that.

436
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:24,990
Nice.

437
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,050
Thank you.

438
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,990
Let me go ahead and drop my drop.

439
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,030
While we're over here.

440
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,630
Do I get split circuit or power pylon?

441
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,550
Double HP or two pylons?

442
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,070
Double HP yeah.

443
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,010
Double HP on that.

444
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:37,990
Nice.

445
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,350
You or me?

446
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:42,810
Me right?

447
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,070
Link.

448
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,630
Yeah I mean you just keep it on lifeline yeah?

449
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,310
Yep.

450
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,610
Alright let's go hit the portal here.

451
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,070
Yay.

452
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,050
I'm still holding that turbo for you.

453
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,490
Oh okay I can take it.

454
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,490
Oh there's somebody in map room.

455
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,190
They stuck their territory there.

456
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,370
Yeah.

457
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,730
Alright let's go hit the portal.

458
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,130
Wait where are we then?

459
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,470
Where are we planning on going anyway?

460
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,410
We're gonna fly towards Hydrodom.

461
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,090
Okay.

462
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,290
And then we're gonna like look to probably try and like maybe get on a wall here or something.

463
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,610
Okay.

464
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,290
We're just looking to get into uh...

465
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,310
Repulsor.

466
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,570
Alright.

467
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,070
You ready?

468
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,010
Take it.

469
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,450
Wee!

470
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,960
Looking like...

471
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,400
Looks like the wall's gonna be free.

472
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
I think we land towards the left over here.

473
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,800
Okay.

474
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,980
And like over here and then I'm gonna evac all three of us up to the top.

475
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,540
Okay.

476
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,540
I...

477
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,640
I fucked up my fall.

478
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,700
I forgot a dolphin.

479
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,260
You're good.

480
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,480
It's okay.

481
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,980
Let's hope nobody shoots the evac.

482
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,540
They are fighting in these buildings in front of us.

483
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,120
It's all crypto.

484
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,620
Really?

485
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:01,800
Okay.

486
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,340
Oh yeah.

487
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,300
I just heal on drone here actually.

488
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,060
Almost here guys.

489
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,060
Yep.

490
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,460
You're good.

491
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,340
Hey.

492
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:14,780
Hey!

493
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,360
We going in?

494
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,620
I think we just take our close building here.

495
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,480
Alright.

496
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:25,920
Climbing up.

497
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,860
They might be on the other side.

498
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,060
I think they are.

499
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,460
Oh.

500
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:31,920
Massacre.

501
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,500
You see this lifeline?

502
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,520
Do they see us?

503
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,800
Yep.

504
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,620
Nice.

505
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,600
Nice.

506
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:38,760
Nice.

507
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,420
Yay!

508
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,640
Watch out behind.

509
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,180
I'm dragging around.

510
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,600
Nice.

511
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:45,640
Nice.

512
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:45,700
Nice.

513
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I got my drone for you too.

514
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,440
I'm gonna watch the other door.

515
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,320
Can you... The door's broken.

516
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,200
Can you put fences everywhere?

517
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,700
Yeah.

518
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,040
Yeah.

519
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,340
Yeah.

520
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,500
Yeah.

521
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,020
I forgot I was watching for a sec when you died.

522
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,160
You're so nice.

523
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,220
I was like, oh yeah.

524
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,640
Should we put pylon?

525
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,260
There's a sniper.

526
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,680
Probably put it in the room.

527
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,180
Yeah.

528
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,360
Yeah.

529
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,420
Put it in here.

530
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,660
You're all good on bats?

531
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,780
I have five bats.

532
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,740
Watch that sniper.

533
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,180
Just keep this door closed.

534
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,300
If you get shot or anything, you can just come and heal on this.

535
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,900
Whoa!

536
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:28,920
Yeah.

537
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,320
Melanie's gone, Bri.

538
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,120
How many more fence do I have?

539
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,580
A lot.

540
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,380
Here you go.

541
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,100
It's okay.

542
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,180
It's like a little puzzle.

543
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,420
What do I have?

544
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,260
Oh, I have two more.

545
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,320
Uhh...

546
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,360
Nice.

547
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,200
Oh, they have a fuckin' ramp right there.

548
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,000
It's okay.

549
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,680
Now we live.

550
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,160
We live here until we're top six.

551
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,940
We don't have to do anything.

552
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,860
Yeah, we're vibin'.

553
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,550
Woooo!

554
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,120
Guys, I haven't touched this game in two weeks.

555
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,360
I...

556
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,720
Oh!

557
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,220
Girl!

558
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,020
I just got my new PC.

559
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,360
No passion.

560
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,840
They smoked those.

561
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,140
Guys, this is not my main game, guys.

562
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,300
Yeah, if they pull this...

563
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,280
We just gotta fight out.

564
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,820
Can you come play out here with me, Mel?

565
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,800
Just smoke right here and cross.

566
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,780
I think if we get pushed, we need to play on this side.

567
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,360
By the way.

568
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,360
We'll get sniped on the other side.

569
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,780
Yeah, we gotta make sure...

570
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,160
If we get pushed, don't ever peek on the west side.

571
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,520
You'll get shot from the whole server.

572
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,020
Yeah.

573
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,680
Ooh, let's help zone.

574
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,700
Hands on us.

575
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,720
Yeah, I mean...

576
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,300
Honestly, if the zone...

577
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,940
Oh, what the fuck?

578
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,660
Hey, there's somebody right here.

579
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,700
Be careful.

580
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,280
They might be able to see you if you're in here.

581
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,160
Gotcha.

582
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,880
It's okay.

583
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,800
I don't need it.

584
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,140
I'm healing on the drone, by the way.

585
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,760
Should I drop my care pack in front of this other door?

586
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,240
Or in front of this back door?

587
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,220
Ooh, that zone shit.

588
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,520
Right here, so we can have a little bit more cover to peek out.

589
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,340
Alright, we're not safe.

590
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,060
Can we...

591
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,520
No!

592
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,860
Can we start moving this way?

593
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,580
Yeah.

594
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,280
Can you guys come out here?

595
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,860
Can you smoke out here?

596
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,800
Just, yeah, loot your pack.

597
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,740
Smoke out here.

598
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,480
Ooh.

599
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Wait, which... where are we?

600
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,660
Are we using a redeploy or...

601
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,440
We're gonna like...

602
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,820
Yeah, we're gonna like... we're gonna like run out to our north.

603
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,660
Just come to me.

604
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,520
Just come to me and drop down.

605
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:45,740
Alright.

606
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,460
We're gonna like look to just get in zone, honestly.

607
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,100
Okay.

608
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,600
Here, let's go right together.

609
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,100
All together.

610
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,360
I feel so safe running in the open.

611
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,300
We're just gonna get... we're just gonna get in the bunker here in front of us.

612
00:23:59,620 --> 00:23:59,940
Okay.

613
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,340
You guys ready to cross?

614
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,520
Maybe smoke right here, Mel?

615
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,320
Oh, jeez.

616
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,080
Cross here, cross here.

617
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,880
Run, they can't shoot down.

618
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,300
Okay, just play here for now.

619
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,300
Let's get like, just... we're gonna hold all this.

620
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay.

621
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,540
I honestly want you guys to come all the way to me.

622
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,120
Come all the way to me.

623
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,560
Coming.

624
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,680
Come, come, come.

625
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,260
Alright.

626
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,300
We're gonna play...

627
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,060
somewhere here.

628
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,860
I don't think... nobody's in here.

629
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,180
Nobody's in there?

630
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,160
Would you rather play that building?

631
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,780
Honestly, yeah.

632
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,800
Okay, I'm gonna take my fences.

633
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,800
We can like just play kind of everything, you know?

634
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,520
Yeah, yeah.

635
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,000
We don't really want anyone to play near us.

636
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,380
Alright, fencing.

637
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,500
Should I put my ult somewhere here?

638
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,640
Yeah, you can put it like maybe right in the middle here.

639
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,080
Alright.

640
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,740
Just like right in the middle of those two things.

641
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,100
There's stuff here.

642
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay, okay.

643
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,280
I can't put it here because there's stuff in front of us.

644
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,960
Please somebody...

645
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,200
take some of the things.

646
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,520
They popped the ziv.

647
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:03,960
They popped the ziv.

648
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,500
I almost cracked this here.

649
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,120
They have purple.

650
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,880
They're getting shot right now.

651
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,360
Alright.

652
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,440
This is the best I can put my ult.

653
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
I might be able to nade one here.

654
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,040
I killed one.

655
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,340
Nice.

656
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,820
Ooh, nice kill.

657
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,840
They're looking down.

658
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,440
I wouldn't take that.

659
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,740
I'm vortnating.

660
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,680
Yeah, I didn't get hits.

661
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,180
I'll take that when I'm back.

662
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,220
I almost killed one.

663
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,860
They're both low up there.

664
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm gonna bang ult them.

665
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,660
I think the bang died again.

666
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,320
If we get a bunch of ticks, I think we like...

667
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,480
I cracked them.

668
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:46,820
Shit on them.

669
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,140
Shit on them.

670
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,340
Can we take it?

671
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,680
Can we take it?

672
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,560
I'm going with you.

673
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:49,980
I'm going with you.

674
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,180
One down.

675
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,140
I got it all day.

676
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,660
I got the other teams.

677
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,420
I thirsted.

678
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:58,820
I thirsted.

679
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,660
Nice.

680
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm down here with you guys, so...

681
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,340
I'm down here with you guys, so...

682
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,460
I'm gonna loot him.

683
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,260
I can give you an evac here.

684
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,840
I'm gonna loot this stuff.

685
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,540
He has bats.

686
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,800
I got six.

687
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,600
Alright, this is looking like an evac in angle.

688
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,320
Yeah.

689
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,460
Do we have a tower and try to play for Rook of Haste, do you think?

690
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,620
Do we reach all the way over there?

691
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,220
No, we don't.

692
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,760
It's not really possible.

693
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,380
Honestly, I think our play is to go like there.

694
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,500
What do I do?

695
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,720
Yeah, like just one.

696
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,180
You see this?

697
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,240
This is one guy.

698
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,000
You see that?

699
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,880
It's just one guy there.

700
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,120
I think what we're gonna do is two of us, at least two of us are gonna pop evacs.

701
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,840
Doki, we're gonna pop you an evac, so don't worry.

702
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,420
Oh yeah.

703
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,220
I have an evac too.

704
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,700
Yeah, we do.

705
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,320
Alright, here I'm gonna pop it.

706
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,800
Pop your evac up here, someone.

707
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,480
Woah, woah, woah.

708
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,500
You can't.

709
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
We're just gonna take this one then.

710
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,760
There's an evac on the right as well.

711
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,260
You guys ready?

712
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,520
We're going for that ping right there, okay?

713
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,180
Don't dip at all.

714
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,160
Just fly straight to it.

715
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,040
I'm gonna try and wall instantly, okay?

716
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,740
Okay.

717
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Just land Doki and you're gonna need a gen here.

718
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,960
It's only two guys.

719
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,020
I got hit for 100.

720
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,520
I'm already dead.

721
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,540
I'm holding.

722
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,460
I'm dead.

723
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,620
You gotta tap me, tap me, tap me.

724
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,860
Fight, fight, fight.

725
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,080
It's only two guys.

726
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,960
Oh, I couldn't.

727
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,360
No!

728
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,740
Now we're getting shot in the ass.

729
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,020
Yeah, we got shot by everybody there.

730
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,380
That was so many people.

731
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,520
These guys are literally just holding everything, bro.

732
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,000
I know, there's nowhere to move into.

733
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,520
Oh my god.

734
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,900
That sucks.

735
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,440
Yeah, the end zone was pretty fucked.

736
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,540
I literally got hit in the air for 100.

737
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,100
Yeah, I did see that.

738
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,360
Oh, yeah.

739
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,320
You lost all your shield.

740
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,260
Yeah, I literally didn't even get to shoot him.

741
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,440
Man, that sucks.

742
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,800
Okay, we have a second game in KC.

743
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,300
Well, yeah, how does it work?

744
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,580
Is it randomized teams every game?

745
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,760
It's every two games.

746
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,060
Every map is a new team.

747
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,160
Oh, really?

748
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:02,880
Yeah.

749
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,020
Every map is a new?

750
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,800
Yeah, every map is a new team.

751
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,320
So, like, KC is a new team.

752
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,640
Like, KC, we stick together.

753
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,600
And then after KC, we dip.

754
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,040
Okay, okay.

755
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,260
Because it's every two games.

756
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,700
And then on the second game, Temple's gonna tell us.

757
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,320
Tell us, like, who our new teams are.

758
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,880
Okay, gotcha.

759
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,200
Alright.

760
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,740
It's okay.

761
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,880
We have round two!

762
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,240
We have round two of this team.

763
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,320
Now I need to look at fucking Sound Guy's notes on, like, how to adjust everybody.

764
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,060
Yes, there's, like, five frames because I'm tabbed out.

765
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,720
Alright.

766
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,040
Melanie is quiet.

767
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,260
Yeah.

768
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,800
She's so quiet right now.

769
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:43,940
Um...

770
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,160
It'll be time to switch though.

771
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,580
Honestly, I'm gonna let her be quiet.

772
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,740
Okay, so Sound Guy does not like Melanie.

773
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,560
Okay.

774
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,000
Sound Guy was just like, it's alright.

775
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:10,540
Because everybody else sounds okay apparently.

776
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,360
Because everybody else sounds okay apparently.

777
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,660
Just don't say it like that!

778
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,320
Alright.

779
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,480
Um, but everybody else sounds okay, right?

780
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,100
Sound Guy is just, fuck Melanie, right?

781
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,920
And people's chat was like, I wanna hear what Melanie has to say.

782
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,440
Like, I...

783
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,740
Um...

784
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,080
But yeah, Sound Guy is...

785
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,580
Is everybody else okay though?

786
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,040
Is every... everybody else okay?

787
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,180
Are we...

788
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,300
Are we good to go with everybody else?

789
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,840
Wow, Sound Guy.

790
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,120
How could you...

791
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,580
I just met Melanie.

792
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,600
I can't... and she's my new Apex Oshi.

793
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,940
Yeah, okay.

794
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
As long as...

795
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,980
I guess as long as it's dropped and free.

796
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,740
Sounds okay.

797
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,360
Um...

798
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,660
Yeah.

799
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,960
If I look left and right you can see... it's not noticeable.

800
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,680
Not noticeable because uh... uh...

801
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,080
Because like, um... I'm not like as big on the screen.

802
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,700
But I mean I could just... okay I'll show you guys.

803
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,180
I'll show you guys.

804
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,860
Okay.

805
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,840
Actually no because I can't... I don't have the...

806
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,900
I don't have the keyboard shortcut to like reposition myself and I'm lazy.

807
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,480
So look... zoom in on your...

808
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,960
Ha ha ha ha!

809
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,440
Ha ha ha!

810
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:36,980
Oh!

811
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,220
Oh!

812
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,240
Nevermind.

813
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,580
Apparently... nevermind.

814
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,080
I disabled my hockey.

815
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,860
Give me a sec guys.

816
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,360
Let me fix this.

817
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:44,760
Okay.

818
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:53,460
I need to be... I need to disappear for a sec because like I have my bindings to like items that would put items out on my screen.

819
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,040
So that's why it doesn't work.

820
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,920
Give me a sec.

821
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,960
I disappear now.

822
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,700
So I have to disable some stuff.

823
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,340
I disabled my...

824
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,620
Alright here we go.

825
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,220
Okay.

826
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,440
Um...

827
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,940
I need to disable stuff and only put aimbot.

828
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:09,960
Ha ha ha ha!

829
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,360
Because...

830
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,640
Like I said...

831
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,640
If I... if I...

832
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,060
Turn it on... I would have...

833
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,480
So many things are gonna start fucking going yee-haw.

834
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,020
Ha ha ha ha!

835
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:31,220
A lot of things are just gonna suddenly show up and we'll be so confused.

836
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,840
Alright there we go.

837
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,340
Um... hockey's a bitch.

838
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:35,860
Okay.

839
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,860
Um...

840
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,580
Alright.

841
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,820
I'm back in it.

842
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,840
Alright so you see this?

843
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,420
Whoa!

844
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,460
So if I start aiming it'll be like...

845
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,140
Zoom.

846
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,320
And then... Okay because I can now... I'll show you guys.

847
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,360
Huge.

848
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,200
You see that?

849
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,080
Whoa whoa.

850
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,700
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

851
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,440
Left right left right whoa!

852
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,040
Left right left right!

853
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:00,940
Whoa!

854
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,000
Ha ha ha ha ha!

855
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,120
And then aim!

856
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,960
Whoa whoa whoa!

857
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,400
So yes.

858
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,540
That's how it works guys.

859
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,760
Ummm...

860
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,100
So yeah.

861
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:16,800
It's okay.

862
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,920
Now I won't like throw in like 20 different toggles in while I'm playing.

863
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:21,980
So...

864
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,600
At least like now we know like nobody's contesting us.

865
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,620
That's good to know.

866
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,000
Uh... I can see the code.

867
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:38,300
Guys see I told you even though I have aimbot eyes even though I have aimbot eyes it doesn't mean jack shit cause we didn't get... we didn't even get top 6.

868
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,100
So...

869
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,520
It's...

870
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,880
Ha ha ha ha ha!

871
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,940
So it doesn't matter.

872
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,400
You can't be like oh my god you have wallhacks.

873
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,980
Like that didn't do jack shit.

874
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,740
Wallhacks not gonna save me from 4 different peop- from 20 people shooting at me.

875
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,360
Like...

876
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,400
Ha ha ha ha ha!

877
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,060
For fuck- like 20 people were shooting at me.

878
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,000
You think wallhacks can save me?

879
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,520
I'll just get to see those 20 people uh...

880
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,720
Surrounding me.

881
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,980
Hmm... I don't have- I don't have the speed hacks.

882
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,560
That's why.

883
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,120
I can't go- I'm not Sonic.

884
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,400
Who won?

885
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,940
Saucer won?

886
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,620
Who's on his team?

887
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,320
Who's on his team?

888
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,000
And can he be on my team next game?

889
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,940
Ha ha ha ha!

890
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,320
Ha ha ha ha!

891
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,620
Alright which team are we better than?

892
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,400
Where's us?

893
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,080
Dropped.

894
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,060
We're better- we're better than half of- oh wait!

895
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,120
He's not TSM anymore.

896
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,840
We're better- Ha ha ha ha!

897
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,620
Ha ha ha ha!

898
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,360
Forgot.

899
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,000
He's- he's- he's- Not in TSM but at least we're better than Falcon!

900
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,860
We're better than Falcon!

901
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,300
And TSM!

902
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,540
And half of TSM.

903
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,180
Ha ha ha ha!

904
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,520
Ha ha ha!

905
00:33:50,620 --> 00:34:01,680
My- my- My benchmark is that as long as I'm better than Hal in a turni- like for a game in a tournament like that means I've made it.

906
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,900
That means like I'm not that bad.

907
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,660
Ha ha ha ha ha!

908
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,420
Ha ha ha ha!

909
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,460
Ha ha ha ha!

910
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,820
That's all that matters.

911
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:21,820
As long as you're better than Hal, placed higher than Hal in any game, then you know, you know that you're not dogshit.

912
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,840
You're- Ha ha ha ha!

913
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,980
That's a win!

914
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,220
That's a win!

915
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,480
You placed higher than the CEO of Apex Legends?

916
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,000
That's a fucking win!

917
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,620
Ha ha ha ha!

918
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,160
Ha ha ha ha!

919
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,800
Poor Hal.

920
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,320
He's- what is he gonna cry?

921
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,540
For his millions of dollars of playing for Saudi Arabia?

922
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,120
Like- Ha ha ha ha!

923
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,620
Like- Oh no!

924
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,420
Ha ha ha ha!

925
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,670
Doki, you can't- You can't say that!

926
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,490
Bro, he doesn't care?

927
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,490
He doesn't fucking care?

928
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,910
Ha ha ha!

929
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,490
Ha ha ha!

930
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,770
Ha ha ha!

931
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:05,910
Bro!

932
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,670
He has the oil money!

933
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,090
Like, what the fuck?

934
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:16,870
Do you think he really cares about getting an additional- Bro, how much do you win?

935
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,170
How much money do you win from this?

936
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,370
Per game?

937
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,130
Like two thou- Like, okay, 2,800 split by four.

938
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,650
Guys, 2,800 split by four, guys.

939
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:29,990
Um...

940
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,630
This next game...

941
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,110
We're gonna hit...

942
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,590
$700.

943
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,550
Do you think he cares about $700?

944
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,830
When he has literally oil money?

945
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,430
That way we can know where the game is gonna end, you know?

946
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,470
Okay, yeah, I'm down.

947
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,770
And then I'm gonna play Pathfinder so we can have UAVs.

948
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:47,770
Okay.

949
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,570
That way we can hit the third circle and then just...

950
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,330
basically also UAV to see what spots are open and then just rotate in.

951
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,750
Okay, gotcha.

952
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,930
A lot of people are playing Valk also.

953
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,650
Yeah, but I mean, we're finding so many EVACs, I don't think we need Valk.

954
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:07,730
I don't think we- Yeah, I think Valk is just for like, if none of them have EVACs type deal.

955
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:08,770
Yeah.

956
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,130
I don't know if it's just a bonus.

957
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,030
But we had four EVACs and three POIs.

958
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,690
Yeah, we're gonna get plenty of EVACs.

959
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,790
I was thinking about playing Valk too, but...

960
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,710
I think everything else is just better.

961
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,250
So only you're changing the character, right?

962
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,250
Yeah, yeah.

963
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,570
We're keeping the same characters other than me.

964
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,090
Okay.

965
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Okay, who said that?

966
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,540
Well, we know you don't care now.

967
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,640
Look, I care!

968
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,260
I'm just lazy!

969
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,000
That's different!

970
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,920
I have a million things going on!

971
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,660
That's different!

972
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,260
I care too!

973
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,620
I don't know what I'm talking about!

974
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,680
I also care!

975
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,720
I just have a million things!

976
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,240
I just have a million things!

977
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,160
I just do it right now.

978
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,800
Now I'm not gonna forfeit just to spite you.

979
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,020
Now I'm not gonna forfeit just to spite you.

980
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,280
Thank you.

981
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,300
And you're like, Toki, are you a child?

982
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:26,480
You know how people, kids are like, now that mom wants me to do it, I'm not gonna do it.

983
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,860
I'm gonna hold that 10k hostage.

984
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,440
That's gonna be like my rainy day fund.

985
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:38,600
The moment I'm like, the moment I'm like, oh shit, I need 10k to pay off something, I'll do the tax for it.

986
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:52,700
I'm gonna make Tempo hold on to the money and have it build up more and more and more.

987
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,020
Until I...

988
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,980
It's like interest rates, except there's no interest rate going in.

989
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,600
It's like he's holding it in just for the sake of holding it in.

990
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,340
He's my Tempo bank.

991
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,000
Tempo's gonna be my bank.

992
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,960
My bank account.

993
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,440
My emergency 10k whenever I need it.

994
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,380
My emergency 10k whenever I need it.

995
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,140
It's not tax evasion if I don't do the forms!

996
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,120
It's not tax evasion if I don't do the forms!

997
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,900
It's not...

998
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,980
How am I evading taxes if I've never done the form?

999
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,800
I'm just not fucking claiming the money yet.

1000
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,080
I just haven't...

1001
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,220
Okay, you know what's funny?

1002
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,540
So you know how I did that Apex sponsor?

1003
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,580
Tempo's also handling that, too.

1004
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,040
So...

1005
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,600
Like, handling the payment for me.

1006
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,000
So I still haven't...

1007
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,940
I didn't...

1008
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,940
So the tax form covers everything.

1009
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:05,060
The tax form covers all the Apex payments.

1010
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:11,440
The tax form covers all the Apex payments.

1011
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,260
The tax form covers all the Apex payments.

1012
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,940
The tax form covers all the Apex payments.

1013
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,840
I did the other tax forms!

1014
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:14,540
Okay?

1015
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,160
I did the high end tax forms!

1016
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,300
I did so many!

1017
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,660
Okay, I didn't.

1018
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,220
My accountant did all the tax forms.

1019
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,100
Okay, alright.

1020
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,300
Tonight, tonight, after this, after this, in between...

1021
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:48,160
In between this stream and Apcon stuff, I will forward my tax form over to my accountant.

1022
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,560
And then I'll finally, I'll finally, I'll finally do the taxes.

1023
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:59,060
I'll finally, I'll finally claim the taxes.

1024
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,580
Not claim the taxes.

1025
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,540
I'll finally claim my prize money.

1026
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,820
My, I think, I think it's like at least 10k including the sponsor.

1027
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,420
I got like, including the Apex sponsor money.

1028
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Um, I think it's 10k because I did so many fucking, um, I did so many like tournaments for Tempo.

1029
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,180
So, um...

1030
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,890
There's so many tax forms!

1031
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,250
You don't understand!

1032
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,670
There's so many forms!

1033
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,850
I get sent so many forms!

1034
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,150
I look at, I don't have to do any of them.

1035
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,070
I just look at it.

1036
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,650
And even then I'm like, there's so many forms!

1037
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,330
And then...

1038
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,310
This is gonna turn into the PC unboxing stream again.

1039
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,790
Thank you for the super chat.

1040
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,710
Thank you, thank you.

1041
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,930
This is different, guys.

1042
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,390
This is so different.

1043
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,150
Oh my god.

1044
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,110
It's not evading!

1045
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,270
I just didn't, never claimed the money.

1046
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,970
If I never, it's like I just did it for free.

1047
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,150
Alright, round two.

1048
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:12,770
Yeah!

1049
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,330
This game is a W.

1050
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,250
Yeah, top six!

1051
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,710
No, we gotta have low expectations so it'll be a little surprise.

1052
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,930
It's like a little birthday present.

1053
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,370
Okay, okay.

1054
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,370
I'm saying W though.

1055
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,110
If you want top six, you're gonna want top six.

1056
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,230
Top six!

1057
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,510
What do you even get for top six?

1058
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,350
Oh my god, yeah, $100.

1059
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,830
Yeah, $100 each.

1060
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,730
Oh my god, I can...

1061
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,630
I can pay for my Disney Plus subscription with that.

1062
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:43,870
What the fuck?

1063
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,310
How much is that Disney Plus subscription?

1064
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,290
I don't know, it's fucking Disney.

1065
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,770
They always need more money.

1066
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,460
I don't know, what do I get to with my $100?

1067
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,120
That I'm gonna add to the temple bank.

1068
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,320
One whole month.

1069
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:13,820
Yes.

1070
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,580
Guys, that's $100 to the temple bank!

1071
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,360
For after I fucking death you, my gun would not survive.

1072
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,240
Yeah, I mean honestly I fucking...

1073
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,260
And I tried to tap whoever went down after that too, and I was like, ugh.

1074
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,160
I'm just rusty on Newcastle, I could've lived there.

1075
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,700
Ditto for life.

1076
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:40,000
If I would've just Q'd, if I would've just thrown my Q, my shield, I could've probably lived, but I just fucking haven't played the trick card yet.

1077
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,560
The temple bank.

1078
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,640
You guys invest in the Doki bank, I keep my money in the temple bank.

1079
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,040
Alright, I need to head over to the center.

1080
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,280
You hear Doki?

1081
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,560
Yeah, I'm not unmuted, no!

1082
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,420
You can land over here, Mel.

1083
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,000
Maybe I should do push to talk.

1084
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,040
Like loot under the balloon and stuff.

1085
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,980
Push to talk seems so much more convenient now.

1086
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,600
Now that I think about it.

1087
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,640
In these games.

1088
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,220
Oh my god.

1089
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,020
Why did I do push to talk?

1090
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,720
I should've just been doing push to talk!

1091
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,020
Alright.

1092
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,620
Push to talk is... guys, it's been a while.

1093
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,840
Guys, I... doing these tournaments.

1094
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,940
I feel like I just... I'm off my groove.

1095
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,700
I'm off my groove with like socializing with new people.

1096
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,020
It's just... it's been... it's been rough.

1097
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,660
I used all of it at Avcon.

1098
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,240
No, they can't... I muted myself.

1099
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,340
That's why they're like, are you alive?

1100
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,160
And I'm like, oh no, I'm still muted.

1101
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,540
I just wanted to talk to you guys.

1102
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,160
No, I won't forget.

1103
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,440
I think I did... did I do push to talk before?

1104
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,340
Guys, it's... bro, I don't remember.

1105
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,960
It's been so long since I played with a randomized team.

1106
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,200
Oh my god.

1107
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,420
They don't need to hear me.

1108
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,420
I give no actual input.

1109
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,300
Make sure you guys ping Evax for each other if you see him.

1110
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,320
Yep, gotcha.

1111
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:19,200
Like, I... my... my intel is literally useless to them.

1112
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,340
They don't need my intel.

1113
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,840
Like, how am I gonna help my team anyway?

1114
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,820
I'm not gonna assist them in any way.

1115
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:29,900
Ooh.

1116
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,820
Okay.

1117
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,740
Oh, falling stars.

1118
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,400
Nice.

1119
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:34,920
Alright.

1120
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,520
Excellent.

1121
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,380
I mean, it's not like... okay, yes, I am an introvert.

1122
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,860
It's just that... like...

1123
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,340
I got an Evax.

1124
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,120
Okay, also, there's four of us, which means that's close.

1125
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:46,620
Looking for a Havoc?

1126
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:52,140
Four of us equals getting hit by Introvert Doki because there's four of us now.

1127
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,620
It's easier when there's three!

1128
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,780
When it's three, it's so much easier.

1129
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,660
You didn't gaslight?

1130
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,820
I think they really want that thousand dollars.

1131
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,580
Or no, seven hundred dollars.

1132
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,960
Here's an Evax, Mel.

1133
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,640
I feel like they really want that seven.

1134
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,100
Like, I can tell they're also like super...

1135
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,800
This is a try-hard squad.

1136
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,020
These guys care.

1137
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,680
These guys actually care.

1138
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,680
I'm good.

1139
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,380
I got size.

1140
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,080
I'm chillin'.

1141
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,080
Yeah, I need a...

1142
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,280
Alright.

1143
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,200
I'm gonna loot this and then...

1144
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,340
Oh my god, no heavy ammo.

1145
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
I'm gonna loot this and I'm gonna mute myself, guys.

1146
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,360
I'm gonna do it.

1147
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,880
I'm gonna...

1148
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
I'm gonna do it, guys.

1149
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,280
I'm gonna hit this UAV.

1150
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,960
Oh god, I didn't do the control.

1151
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,080
I didn't do my job.

1152
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,060
Doki, just run over here and hit your console when you can.

1153
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,780
Oh my god, I knew I didn't do it.

1154
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,860
I didn't do my job.

1155
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,400
I'm so sorry.

1156
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,340
Oh my god, here we go.

1157
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,040
And then we're just gonna go towards this UAV next.

1158
00:45:59,280 --> 00:45:59,600
Alright.

1159
00:45:59,600 --> 00:45:59,920
Nice.

1160
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,680
I want money to give to them.

1161
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,760
I want money to put in my tempo bank.

1162
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,780
Alright, guys.

1163
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,960
This is the last thing I'll say.

1164
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,240
I'll see you guys on the other side before I try to talk to my team and socialize.

1165
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,560
I was gonna be going towards...

1166
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:27,230
Oh my god, we're so far from zone again.

1167
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:28,210
No.

1168
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:30,050
Yeah, yeah.

1169
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:30,590
We're good though.

1170
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,370
Hit that assault bin, Mel.

1171
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,090
I'm going to...

1172
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,690
I need a hemlock if you'll find one.

1173
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:43,510
Alright.

1174
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,830
Oh, I want that bat.

1175
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:47,830
I still have...

1176
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:53,370
I still have a white backpack so if anybody finds a blue...

1177
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,970
Can you smoke me on this beacon, Mel?

1178
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,250
Just come up, like climb up.

1179
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:00,990
I'll wait for you.

1180
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:04,790
Yeah, there is a team in your base so I'm gonna go body block.

1181
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,680
Yay!

1182
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,900
Yeah, there's a lot.

1183
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,080
Okay.

1184
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,900
Hit this.

1185
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,220
Um...

1186
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,500
This is just kind of a hard zone to read, honestly.

1187
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,960
Like, I want us to play for that but it's gonna be pretty impossible to do that.

1188
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,540
Yeah.

1189
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,280
I mean, we have four evacs again.

1190
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,480
Yeah.

1191
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,620
I'm thinking like...

1192
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,560
We can go for like this house maybe?

1193
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,520
Are you getting this harvester?

1194
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,220
For now.

1195
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,060
Yeah.

1196
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:43,880
Hold up where?

1197
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,480
On the top spot?

1198
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,280
Yeah, I mean...

1199
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:46,640
Yeah.

1200
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,660
We can like hold all that.

1201
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:48,660
Mm-hmm.

1202
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,000
I don't have any...

1203
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,760
There was like...

1204
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,100
There was like a bunch of people like...

1205
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,460
In front of us.

1206
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:55,720
Yeah.

1207
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,980
There's somebody there.

1208
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,600
Evac in front of us.

1209
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,400
We can maybe shoot one of these guys off of this.

1210
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:01,980
Last one.

1211
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,900
Oh, nobody's getting on.

1212
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,480
They're not taking it.

1213
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,000
They're in front of us.

1214
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:07,960
They're in front of us in the open here.

1215
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,080
They know about us.

1216
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:09,520
They know about us.

1217
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:09,920
They have blues.

1218
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,940
Cracked one.

1219
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,560
They're sliding down the hill.

1220
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:17,820
Lobo's cracked.

1221
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,520
Lobo's cracked flush.

1222
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,160
Oh, nice.

1223
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:19,460
Nice.

1224
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:19,720
Nice.

1225
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:20,780
Can you guys full?

1226
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,240
Can you guys full?

1227
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:21,520
Shoot him.

1228
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,220
Right here.

1229
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,860
No, he's sliding down the hill.

1230
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,120
Yeah, they ulted.

1231
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,740
They ulted.

1232
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,140
They did.

1233
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:27,600
They did slide him.

1234
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,160
Okay.

1235
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,980
I'm getting a right angle.

1236
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,580
Can someone look at our back as well?

1237
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:31,520
I'm looking.

1238
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,800
I lost our back.

1239
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:33,800
Oh.

1240
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,240
Oh.

1241
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:34,360
Oh.

1242
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,360
I'll look at them.

1243
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,660
I'm just getting sent all...

1244
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,840
You're getting sniped from across the way.

1245
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,020
I'm good.

1246
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:39,280
I'm good.

1247
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:39,460
I'm good.

1248
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,260
I'm looking behind us.

1249
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,700
Nothing behind us yet.

1250
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,700
I think they got the rez up.

1251
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,800
Can we just go through the choke?

1252
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,200
Okay.

1253
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,420
Yeah.

1254
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,120
I just don't really know where the full kill's at or anything.

1255
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:54,780
No.

1256
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,200
Am I kidding?

1257
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,680
I'm pretty sure they rez'd it.

1258
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:57,860
Probably.

1259
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:58,640
Yeah.

1260
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,200
Because they ulted us off.

1261
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:00,980
There's a team here.

1262
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,220
Chill.

1263
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:01,380
Chill.

1264
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:01,560
Chill.

1265
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:01,680
Chill.

1266
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:01,800
Chill.

1267
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:01,840
Chill.

1268
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:01,940
Chill.

1269
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:01,960
Chill.

1270
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,000
Chill.

1271
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,340
I'm gonna pop us a zip.

1272
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,140
Okay.

1273
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,260
Don't be dropped.

1274
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,460
I'm good.

1275
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:08,640
I'm good.

1276
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,760
I'm good.

1277
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,220
Just back up.

1278
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,960
Back up through zone here.

1279
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,900
We're safe like right here on this corner.

1280
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,300
Okay.

1281
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,480
There's a lot of teams here.

1282
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,840
We might want to just wrap around a cage.

1283
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,020
We can still redeploy.

1284
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,340
Can we?

1285
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,000
Yeah.

1286
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,080
But these guys might shoot us.

1287
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,020
So we should just run off.

1288
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,200
I'm done.

1289
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,820
We can come around here and honestly play for these beacons.

1290
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:27,760
Okay.

1291
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,080
I need to drop my pack too for my gold.

1292
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:30,900
Okay.

1293
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,420
We got a team coming.

1294
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,660
There might be a team coming.

1295
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,520
Wasn't a team on this side?

1296
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,800
Because they came from...

1297
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:35,820
There was.

1298
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:36,140
Yeah.

1299
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,000
We can check it.

1300
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:37,660
Yeah.

1301
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,160
You can pop your pack here.

1302
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,760
Do we have heal drone or no?

1303
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,860
I think they're gone.

1304
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:45,940
Yeah.

1305
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,280
They're gone.

1306
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:46,740
Alright.

1307
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,880
Come in the zone with me Doki.

1308
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,320
You're gonna hit the console.

1309
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:49,980
Okay.

1310
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,440
I got drone.

1311
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,420
I'm gonna hit the UAV.

1312
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:54,360
Yeah.

1313
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,740
We can get drone when you get out Doki.

1314
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,540
You can just pop ranges.

1315
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,280
Hey.

1316
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:57,540
Hey.

1317
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,080
What else did they got?

1318
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:58,820
Yeah.

1319
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,580
I'll give it to Marge.

1320
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,080
Okay.

1321
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,200
See.

1322
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,680
Their melor dropped.

1323
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,660
Yeah.

1324
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,860
I'll come back and get it.

1325
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,220
I'm just...

1326
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:06,420
Okay.

1327
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,660
I'm gonna hit these beacons real quick.

1328
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:07,960
Yep.

1329
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:10,540
Okay.

1330
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,860
I'm just gonna syringe before I take this.

1331
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,040
Yep.

1332
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,620
You're gonna be good.

1333
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,620
It's only zone one.

1334
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,380
Yeah.

1335
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,000
It's not that far.

1336
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:29,900
Uh... yeah.

1337
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,520
Okay.

1338
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:31,760
Yeah.

1339
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,400
This...

1340
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:32,440
Okay.

1341
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:32,740
Yes!

1342
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,600
That's free.

1343
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,160
Oh god, if I'm gonna make it...

1344
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,080
You can just pop a wrench or something, pop a heal.

1345
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,700
Yeah, I'm not gonna make it.

1346
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:47,440
It'll be good.

1347
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:49,680
Alright.

1348
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,360
Yeah, look at Bunker by the way.

1349
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,100
Like Bunker's free.

1350
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,600
We could literally just evac there, couldn't we?

1351
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,720
Like from this hill?

1352
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,980
I think we could make it in the doorway.

1353
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,200
Does anyone have extra syringes?

1354
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,760
Please.

1355
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:02,120
Please.

1356
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,380
Come to us Mel.

1357
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,600
I'm gonna get the Harvester then.

1358
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,960
I don't think it's really that worth it.

1359
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,180
You're gonna get shot from everyone.

1360
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:10,980
Just come to us.

1361
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,160
We should go for a spot here.

1362
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,640
I'm heading over.

1363
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,440
I'm gonna wait for Mel to pop a bat and everything.

1364
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,540
Can you drop me drone?

1365
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,240
I got 12 seconds.

1366
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,220
I just dropped it for her.

1367
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,200
Alright.

1368
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,180
We're going for Bunker door, okay?

1369
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,340
Yep.

1370
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,200
If Bunker door is taken, we're going to swerve back.

1371
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,220
It looks free though.

1372
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,240
I don't see any movement there.

1373
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,200
If there's a team here, we just gotta slam it, okay?

1374
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,040
You need to smoke the door here.

1375
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,020
There's a team here.

1376
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,700
Play it, pop, play it, pop.

1377
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,620
Oh no.

1378
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,840
I need to get up top.

1379
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,440
They're setting up in there though.

1380
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,320
I might have to smoke for me again so I can get up there.

1381
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,260
Oh god.

1382
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,760
I think another team is walking up there.

1383
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,060
I live here now.

1384
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:07,760
I live here now.

1385
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,840
There's kids up top looking at y'all.

1386
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,420
I need to get over there to y'all.

1387
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:12,900
I need to get over there to y'all.

1388
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,240
Goodbye.

1389
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,280
I hope the team doesn't see me over here.

1390
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,400
Oh god.

1391
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,400
I know you're good.

1392
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,660
If the team up top doesn't see me, I'll be fine.

1393
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,700
I don't have an ult, Excel.

1394
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,660
So, yeah.

1395
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,360
That's crazy.

1396
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:39,140
I literally said to land up here.

1397
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,120
They might be swinging out on you.

1398
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,350
I almost cracked.

1399
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,170
I almost killed the bang.

1400
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:48,870
I can't see anything.

1401
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:50,290
I'm just getting sniped from the side.

1402
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,730
The other team is just gonna look at me over here.

1403
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:54,950
That's not good.

1404
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,770
They're just looking at me over here though.

1405
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,390
I'm gonna try to stay right here.

1406
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:04,770
Oh no.

1407
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:06,290
I'm gonna try to stay right here.

1408
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:07,450
Hello.

1409
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,370
I'm gonna...

1410
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,770
Oh, you have an ult, Excel.

1411
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:13,070
Nice.

1412
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,690
One of us will live.

1413
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,130
One of us will live.

1414
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:39,790
Are you actually getting me?

1415
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:40,850
I am.

1416
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,310
They're gonna shoot at me, fuck off!

1417
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,550
I don't know if this will help you.

1418
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:53,350
Oh, hey!

1419
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:54,370
They want me so bad.

1420
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,050
Are you safe to sit here?

1421
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,390
I don't think so.

1422
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,290
But where else are we gonna go?

1423
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,690
Nah, nowhere.

1424
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:03,470
It's okay!

1425
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,750
Look at all these Arc-Stars that they threw at us!

1426
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,770
You get them when they...

1427
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:08,530
Oh, I did not know that.

1428
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,410
Oh God!

1429
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:11,950
Okay!

1430
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:14,970
Okay.

1431
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,370
Whoa, okay.

1432
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:20,010
Alright, chill a little bit.

1433
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:24,510
Okay.

1434
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,250
That's alright.

1435
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,870
You were safe up there still?

1436
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:36,430
If you can get your gen back, you could definitely like maybe gen behind there.

1437
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,050
Yeah, yeah.

1438
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,470
There might be enough space and then you guys can just play there.

1439
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:42,750
I'm 38 at the moment, so it's gonna be a while.

1440
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,330
Maybe check for ulti-excells on our box?

1441
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,790
No, I took that ulti-excell.

1442
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,390
Oh, okay.

1443
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:47,750
Yeah.

1444
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:52,370
I would say wait till you're next gen and then yeah, just try to...

1445
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,930
People up top are gonna be sliding down on us.

1446
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:58,330
Yeah, pop your lifeline pack in front of you guys right there.

1447
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:59,930
Because if you get a mobi, you could rez this.

1448
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:01,350
That's true.

1449
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,130
Try and get it as close as you can to you.

1450
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:04,390
Yeah, I know.

1451
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:05,390
That's what I'm trying to do.

1452
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,190
So like look up.

1453
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,110
There's a rock above you.

1454
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:08,890
I see them.

1455
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:09,230
I see them.

1456
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,070
I see them on the other side of that smoke.

1457
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,050
Okay.

1458
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,490
Maybe move out a little bit now, Bree, and like go to the right side and not that way.

1459
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:16,450
Behind us?

1460
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:16,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1461
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:17,090
Right there.

1462
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:17,310
Right there.

1463
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:17,470
Perfect.

1464
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:18,430
I just need to keep a good mobi.

1465
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:19,750
Yeah, that's perfect.

1466
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,410
It should give you a mobi.

1467
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,810
It gives you like loot based on shit.

1468
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:25,710
It should, yeah.

1469
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:27,710
Oh.

1470
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:29,450
Other side?

1471
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:30,890
No, that's so fucking stupid.

1472
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:31,910
No way.

1473
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,110
Oh, was that your gold pack?

1474
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,190
No, I already did my gold pack.

1475
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:36,790
What RNG, guys?

1476
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,050
I just gave another gold.

1477
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,310
There was a supply.

1478
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,450
That's so weird.

1479
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:40,670
What?

1480
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:41,610
I got scuffed as fuck.

1481
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:42,850
It's okay.

1482
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,330
We're not the team that died last.

1483
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:47,410
75, guys.

1484
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:48,570
The team died before us.

1485
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,090
The team inside moved out?

1486
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:51,630
I have no idea.

1487
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:52,930
Right?

1488
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,490
I'm just surviving.

1489
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,590
I'm just worried about the team behind us up top.

1490
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:58,510
No, I hear people in there.

1491
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:59,190
They didn't move out.

1492
00:55:59,250 --> 00:55:59,590
Just be careful.

1493
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,810
Because this might be a different team.

1494
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,650
They might not know we're here.

1495
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:03,410
Yeah.

1496
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:08,770
This thing will... we left... I mean, I guess the only thing we can do is just Hail Mary redeploy.

1497
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:09,910
We both have a redeploy.

1498
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:10,610
That's behind us.

1499
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,290
No, that wasn't... that was a bunker.

1500
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:12,790
That was a bunker.

1501
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:14,530
They're trying to kill you guys now.

1502
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:15,050
Oh.

1503
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:16,470
Climb up, maybe.

1504
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:16,690
They don't.

1505
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:17,930
Go climb up.

1506
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,330
Please don't kill me climbing up.

1507
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:21,030
Nope.

1508
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:21,350
Yep.

1509
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,650
It's not gonna fucking happen.

1510
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:22,910
Goodbye.

1511
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:27,210
Nice try, guys.

1512
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:27,910
Thanks.

1513
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,590
Thanks.

1514
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,070
Holy shit.

1515
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:31,870
There's so many people.

1516
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,490
Yeah, I knew they were gonna try to ape us.

1517
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,070
Oh my god.

1518
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,670
It's okay.

1519
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,630
Not last.

1520
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,510
Second last.

1521
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:47,970
Alright, GG's.

1522
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,370
GG's, guys.

1523
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:50,130
GG's.

1524
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,130
Alright.

1525
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,550
Oh my god, they all just left.

1526
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,470
All alone in Team 2.

1527
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,010
We're in the sense of camaraderie.

1528
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,710
They all just left.

1529
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,570
Who's my next team?

1530
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:09,070
I'm with...

1531
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,930
Shit, I am with Saucer!

1532
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,090
Guys, remember?

1533
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:13,930
Saucer got first!

1534
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:18,550
I was like, oh my god, give me Saucer so I can also get first.

1535
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,210
Oh my god, they heard.

1536
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,510
Before Saucer leads us to our deaths.

1537
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,100
They're all...

1538
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,800
Guys, I don't know about you, but I died last.

1539
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,600
I did my job.

1540
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,100
I guess I'll also lead.

1541
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,820
Alright, let's figure out how to do push to talk.

1542
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,900
I haven't done push to talk in a long time.

1543
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,520
Push to talk, okay.

1544
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,620
Oh, fuck.

1545
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,120
Okay.

1546
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,580
We'll do...

1547
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,760
We'll do this.

1548
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,240
Okay, mouse 3, yeah.

1549
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,220
Alright.

1550
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,220
Alright, we're push to talk now.

1551
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,980
Everything's fine now.

1552
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,360
We're push to talk now.

1553
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,220
Alright, so our team...

1554
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,380
Our second game...

1555
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,240
Our second game...

1556
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,480
Our third game, sorry.

1557
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,220
The second game went by so fast.

1558
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,360
Our third game is with...

1559
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,120
Uhhhh...

1560
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,340
Zero loves giving.

1561
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,120
Faye.

1562
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,320
And then there's me.

1563
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,520
Then there's me.

1564
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,600
So we have Saucer.

1565
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:24,760
Uhhhh...

1566
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,360
Zero and Faye.

1567
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:27,980
Um...

1568
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,120
Temple Bank is fixed, bro.

1569
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,520
Um...

1570
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,900
What if we like die so fast?

1571
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,780
I can't believe, like...

1572
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,200
Our pro died first.

1573
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:41,750
How?

1574
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,850
Like, literally all we need is our pro player to be alive.

1575
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:47,910
To do something to like help me.

1576
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,050
No, not...

1577
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,370
Not Falcon Zero.

1578
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,630
Content creator Falcon.

1579
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:56,770
No, sorry.

1580
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,090
Content creator Zero.

1581
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,130
I have no idea who the Zero is.

1582
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,710
But this is content creator Zero.

1583
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:04,350
Um...

1584
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,830
I mean, I live.

1585
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,270
I lived.

1586
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,090
I don't know.

1587
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:14,990
As the weakest player...

1588
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,010
I'm alive.

1589
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:24,150
I...

1590
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:25,810
I did my job.

1591
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,030
And that was to survive.

1592
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:28,090
Okay.

1593
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:30,190
My job was literally survive.

1594
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,190
And I did it.

1595
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:32,210
Um...

1596
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,150
There was no way we're gonna beat the bunker team.

1597
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,210
Because the bunker literally was ramparted up.

1598
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:37,950
Oh my gosh.

1599
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:38,610
This...

1600
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,810
This Bangalore is very confident.

1601
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:42,590
Okay.

1602
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:44,710
There's a reason why he's very confident.

1603
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:45,510
This is...

1604
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,830
This has to be their pro player.

1605
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:47,910
This has...

1606
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,410
You know what?

1607
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,650
Oh, it's Zainu.

1608
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,190
Yeah, he deserves to be conf...

1609
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,370
Yeah.

1610
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,890
I was like...

1611
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:56,630
I was like, damn.

1612
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,770
This is some fucking confident...

1613
00:59:58,770 --> 00:59:59,550
Uh...

1614
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:00,470
Pro right there.

1615
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:01,710
There's a reason why.

1616
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:02,930
Fucking...

1617
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,010
Roller brain right there.

1618
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:08,550
I think that's why I haven't been playing Apex this much.

1619
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:09,650
Because like...

1620
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:10,090
Um...

1621
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:10,670
I'm just...

1622
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:11,190
I'm...

1623
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,370
I just don't want to 1v1 controller players.

1624
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,410
I'm just tired.

1625
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,090
It's like...

1626
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:16,970
It makes me...

1627
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:19,690
Makes me wish I was adding Mrs. right now.

1628
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,010
Yeah.

1629
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,550
Zainu from SSG.

1630
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:23,910
Yeah.

1631
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:27,150
Um...

1632
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:27,930
Uh...

1633
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:28,610
Yeah.

1634
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:29,530
I think that...

1635
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:32,190
That's also why I haven't been playing a lot of Apex.

1636
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:33,370
Because like...

1637
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,350
I'm just tired.

1638
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,730
Of 1v1'ing roller players.

1639
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,750
Because it's just not as fun.

1640
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:41,450
I think it...

1641
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,890
It's just not as fun as 1v1'ing an MNK player.

1642
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,210
Because you get to live a little longer.

1643
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,310
You gotta live a little longer against MNK players.

1644
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:50,290
So like...

1645
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,430
You can see...

1646
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,070
You can see if you'll die.

1647
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:57,790
You know?

1648
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:58,930
You can...

1649
01:00:58,930 --> 01:00:59,510
You can...

1650
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,250
You can like...

1651
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,670
Think a little bit longer.

1652
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:06,090
Um...

1653
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,070
I think that's why...

1654
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,950
Like Ditto's been playing finals too.

1655
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:10,570
Because...

1656
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:11,590
She said like...

1657
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:12,330
In the finals...

1658
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:12,710
No one...

1659
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,650
Uh...

1660
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,170
People...

1661
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,090
You can't really play...

1662
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:17,150
What the f*** is that movement?

1663
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,250
Goodbye Verhos.

1664
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:19,650
Um...

1665
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:20,450
Holy sh**.

1666
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:21,290
That movement...

1667
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,030
Was that Verhos that died?

1668
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:23,690
I don't know.

1669
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:24,510
But that...

1670
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:25,970
Movement was not gonna...

1671
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,070
F***ing...

1672
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:29,490
That super glide is not gonna save you from Apex.

1673
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:29,790
I just...

1674
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,050
Poor guy.

1675
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:32,930
Wait.

1676
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,790
That Bangalore literally got top five for them.

1677
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:35,750
He's gonna get hundred dollars.

1678
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:36,850
Bro!

1679
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:37,750
He got hundred dollars.

1680
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:38,350
He can...

1681
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:39,290
He can also...

1682
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,210
Get Disney Plus subscription.

1683
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:42,590
Go him!

1684
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:47,490
Oh my god!

1685
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,350
What the f*** in my...

1686
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:50,650
Okay.

1687
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:54,030
What is this game?

1688
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:01,210
Okay.

1689
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,830
What the f- He's just creeping!

1690
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:06,210
He's literally just creeping!

1691
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,830
Oh my god.

1692
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:15,170
Oh my god, he gets to watch that shitty Star Wars adaptation.

1693
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:19,570
Guys, no one's playing Watson.

1694
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,710
Watson, guys.

1695
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,610
I don't think Apex was meant to be a 4v4 game.

1696
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:32,210
Guys, I think there's a reason why Apex Legends was- figured out 3 was the magic number.

1697
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:42,370
They realized 3 was the magic number for Apex Legends.

1698
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,650
Bro, 4 is just too many.

1699
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,970
4 is actually just too many.

1700
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:54,230
Especially when it's like final zone.

1701
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,630
You kinda like 4.

1702
01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:05,050
Yeah, but when you're like playing against a lot of really, really good players in teams of 4, it's...

1703
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:07,710
It's a lie.

1704
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,410
Oh shit.

1705
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:14,030
It's okay.

1706
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,450
We're not last.

1707
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:19,250
As long as we're not last, that's all I care about too.

1708
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:26,530
Wait, who's- who's AWOL?

1709
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,650
Oh, that team.

1710
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:29,010
Okay.

1711
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,090
Alright, who's my next map?

1712
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:36,970
This would- Saucer, 0, Faye, and me!

1713
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:39,130
Alright.

1714
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:39,870
Let's see.

1715
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:41,090
What number is this?

1716
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:43,150
Team 9.

1717
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:45,530
Are there any new people in team 9?

1718
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:46,130
Or...

1719
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:47,550
No.

1720
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:50,230
Okay, his old team is still in there, guys.

1721
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,690
His old team is still in- I don't want to interrupt anybody.

1722
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:54,150
His old team is still there.

1723
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:55,450
Um...

1724
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:59,250
Oh, I have to do team- I need to change it too.

1725
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:00,530
Oh, that's so annoying.

1726
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:06,050
Alright, let me...

1727
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:07,450
fix this.

1728
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,850
Uh... that's so annoying.

1729
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,390
You gotta like change the avatars and everything too.

1730
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:14,690
I need to...

1731
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:17,390
I need to change it.

1732
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,210
Alright.

1733
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,070
Nobody's talking.

1734
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,010
I don't want to be the first one to talk.

1735
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:22,390
Really?

1736
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:24,450
I don't want to be the first one to talk.

1737
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:24,450
Really?

1738
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:25,830
I don't want to be the first one to talk.

1739
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:25,830
Really?

1740
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,670
Someone... say anything!

1741
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,570
Oh my god, she breathed!

1742
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:31,990
Hello, hello.

1743
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,830
Oh, thank god!

1744
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:34,590
Hello!

1745
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:37,370
Alright.

1746
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:38,590
Hello, hello.

1747
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:39,850
How were you guys' games?

1748
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:42,130
Uh, it was good.

1749
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,610
We came in sixth last game.

1750
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:45,470
I was not last.

1751
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:46,830
That's all that matters.

1752
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:47,950
Exactly.

1753
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,150
I got gas money.

1754
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,830
Didn't win money, but I was not last.

1755
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,750
You'll win some this game.

1756
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:56,190
I promise.

1757
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:59,250
Can't wait to win my hundred dollars.

1758
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,830
I think I'll make more just streaming right now.

1759
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:05,250
Chat!

1760
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:06,250
I'll make more!

1761
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,310
Not gonna lie, I think I'll make more just getting super chats at the moment.

1762
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,380
Where's team nine?

1763
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,200
Wait, I can't even join team nine.

1764
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:23,780
Wait, alright.

1765
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,340
So what are we playing?

1766
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,380
Wait, Zazie, you got first.

1767
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:29,580
It is what I'm about to say.

1768
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,480
You have the game winning strat.

1769
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,580
You know the meta.

1770
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,080
Okay, Saucer is not existing.

1771
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,020
Okay, nevermind.

1772
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,820
Saucer's not here to help us.

1773
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,620
Saucer's not here right now.

1774
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,240
Would you please leave a message after the beep?

1775
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:45,620
Akron!

1776
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:48,860
Alright.

1777
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,260
Alright, what's the comp?

1778
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,220
What do you like?

1779
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,940
My chat tells me it wins.

1780
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:56,760
Lifeline good.

1781
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:57,600
Pathfinder good.

1782
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,960
I'll play Bang because I'm a one trick.

1783
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,020
And then...

1784
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,000
It's the fourth character.

1785
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,260
Anything else?

1786
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,840
But you won first!

1787
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,060
What was the comp for first?

1788
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,400
It was Newcastle, Rampart, Lifeline, Bang.

1789
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,280
But I think Pathie instead of Newcastle is good.

1790
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:14,820
Okay.

1791
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,600
You guys okay if I take Pathie?

1792
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,220
Alright.

1793
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,000
Yeah, I cannot play him for the life of me so that is all you can do.

1794
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,280
Okay.

1795
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:21,920
Wait, what was it?

1796
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,980
It was a Newcastle, Bang, and what?

1797
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,540
Lifeline and...

1798
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:27,160
Oh.

1799
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:28,540
So...

1800
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:32,820
Well, we're gonna do Path, Bang, Lifeline, Rampart probably.

1801
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:33,440
Okay.

1802
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,440
Actually, what map is this?

1803
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:34,800
Olympus?

1804
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,320
Okay.

1805
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,000
I can do Lifeline.

1806
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:38,800
Alright.

1807
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:39,360
Alright.

1808
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:40,940
Can I go...

1809
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,160
How much time do you think we got?

1810
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:42,740
Let me in team 9!

1811
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:43,780
Before the game starts.

1812
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,700
Probably a good minute.

1813
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:46,780
Couple minutes probably.

1814
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:47,360
Okay.

1815
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,740
You said we're doing Rampart.

1816
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,340
Not last month!

1817
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:51,640
Uh, yeah.

1818
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,380
Turn down zero and bring up Saucy.

1819
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:56,520
Alright.

1820
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:57,140
Rampart's pretty good on this map.

1821
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:58,040
Turn down zero.

1822
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,940
Bring up... alright, I brought...

1823
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:01,620
Can you give me a second?

1824
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,020
I'm gonna see if my dog poops.

1825
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:03,700
I'll be right back.

1826
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,320
Okay.

1827
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:05,420
Alright.

1828
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,500
Oh my god, Push to Talk is so much better.

1829
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:08,440
We got Hydroponics and Elysium.

1830
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,120
Ooh, nice.

1831
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,040
Yeah.

1832
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:12,740
Okay.

1833
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,280
And I'll bring the...

1834
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,820
We'll just stand wherever Ring Console is if we get one.

1835
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:17,460
Yep.

1836
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:18,440
Alright.

1837
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:19,260
Nice.

1838
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,540
Oh, thank you guys!

1839
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,100
Thank you for the extra...

1840
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:22,720
Thank you.

1841
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:23,960
Thank you.

1842
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,640
We don't have to give more money to Tempo's bank account.

1843
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,120
I'm just gonna...

1844
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,480
Thank you guys for the superchats.

1845
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,740
Avi, thank you for the superchat.

1846
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,060
Thank you.

1847
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:33,720
Thank you.

1848
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,360
Yeah, probably.

1849
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,000
DJ, thank you for the superchat.

1850
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:36,440
Thank you.

1851
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,100
Not last.

1852
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:38,680
Money.

1853
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:39,880
Thank god!

1854
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:40,880
Not last!

1855
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,420
That's all that matters.

1856
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:51,900
You're beat to hell.

1857
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,620
Oh, thank god, guys.

1858
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,100
Thank god we don't have to give more money to Tempo's bank account.

1859
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:57,840
I need a tempos bank.

1860
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,760
Guys, I can't even get into my own team!

1861
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,820
Because there's two... Team 9 isn't moving!

1862
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,000
Let me in Team 9!

1863
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,520
I practically got sixth place via Super Chat money.

1864
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,780
Bro, I got... Oh my god!

1865
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:24,180
Not only did I get sixth place, I got two sixth places.

1866
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,030
Oh my god!

1867
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:36,250
Somebody... Someone let me in Team 9.

1868
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:37,810
Sad.

1869
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:41,950
Please.

1870
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:43,990
I'm gonna steal Verhulst's team.

1871
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,330
Oh, thank god.

1872
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:48,090
That's all you had to do!

1873
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:48,630
Just...

1874
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,610
Just sad face Team 9!

1875
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,410
That's all you have to fucking do.

1876
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:55,850
Sad face.

1877
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,370
And then they'll be like...

1878
01:08:58,610 --> 01:08:59,250
Good.

1879
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:04,980
I'm so sad.

1880
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:08,800
I'm so sad.

1881
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:11,960
I feel bad.

1882
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,940
Alright, we have...

1883
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,960
We have...

1884
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,120
We have four more games left.

1885
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,600
So we have...

1886
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,920
I think... I don't know what our second...

1887
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,740
Our third map is.

1888
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:30,800
What is our third map?

1889
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:33,120
Our third map is...

1890
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,680
Broken Moon.

1891
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,840
Alright, nice.

1892
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,920
Broken Moon time.

1893
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,600
I don't wanna get back into Apex though.

1894
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,040
I just feel like...

1895
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,360
It's definitely...

1896
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,120
Definitely feels a little...

1897
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,480
I think the content just feels a little dry at the moment.

1898
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:51,900
It's more so of like...

1899
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,600
I think it's not more so of like...

1900
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,820
The game gunplay...

1901
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,300
At the moment for Apex.

1902
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,060
It's who you're playing with.

1903
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:00,960
And also tournaments.

1904
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,960
I think that's like basically...

1905
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,380
At the moment... I think like...

1906
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:06,040
Apex is at a place right now...

1907
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:07,780
Where...

1908
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,220
It's who you're playing with.

1909
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,340
And also tournaments.

1910
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,400
I feel like regular Apex...

1911
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,760
And new season launches.

1912
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,720
If there's new content.

1913
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,880
This is why I didn't look into like the rank split.

1914
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:21,620
I usually...

1915
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,920
Just like if you're ever in a bangle, you could just slam the walls down.

1916
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:26,080
In a triangle.

1917
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,040
And you'll be safe.

1918
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,380
Or like if there's a lot of nades.

1919
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,140
I'm listening to my IGL.

1920
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,560
Even though it doesn't matter to me.

1921
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,960
I think like right now...

1922
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,060
I've only been...

1923
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,020
Um...

1924
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,120
I've only been paying attention to...

1925
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,160
I've only been paying attention to...

1926
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,380
Who you're playing with.

1927
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:45,840
Tournaments.

1928
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,900
And just new season stuff.

1929
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,080
I heard the new season is going to be exciting.

1930
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,280
I'm not going to spoil anything.

1931
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,760
I'm going to make sure I don't leak anything.

1932
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,020
I'm going to make sure I don't leak anything.

1933
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:00,860
I'm not going to spoil anything.

1934
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:01,100
I'm going to make sure I don't leak anything.

1935
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:05,440
But I heard that the new season might be pretty interesting.

1936
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:06,320
So...

1937
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,340
Can't wait to check out the new season.

1938
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,940
Okay, I maxed out Saucer.

1939
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:11,920
He's at 200 now.

1940
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:12,740
He was at 160.

1941
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,320
I'm actually surprised.

1942
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:17,260
ShibuyaHal.

1943
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,920
Decided to host V-Psycho for Apex again.

1944
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:21,760
Because...

1945
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,540
He said the last V-Psycho was the last one.

1946
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,020
But it's never the last one.

1947
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:27,420
I guess.

1948
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,940
I'm just surprised.

1949
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,600
I thought maybe...

1950
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:44,460
I honestly thought the next V-Psycho would be a fighting game.

1951
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,600
Centric one.

1952
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:47,560
No.

1953
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,440
We're just waiting for the game to start.

1954
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,940
We're waiting for you!

1955
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:58,880
You're stalling the game!

1956
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,080
Wait, it was me?

1957
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,960
Yeah, you're literally the last person!

1958
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,220
Oh, shit.

1959
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:07,400
There we go.

1960
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,400
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if it was like...

1961
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,160
Because they have...

1962
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,340
ShibuyaHal has like merch sold.

1963
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,360
Like actual merch sold in Japan.

1964
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,040
And stuff like regarding V-Psycho.

1965
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,340
There was literally like a little gang violence outside between...

1966
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,000
What?

1967
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,440
Oh, okay.

1968
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:25,920
I was like...

1969
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,620
I thought you meant like actual gang violence.

1970
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,840
As in people were shooting.

1971
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,060
I was like, do you live in America?

1972
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:31,540
Yes.

1973
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:33,840
Well, I do.

1974
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:37,920
I came outside and there was a lady that had a corgi.

1975
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,400
It was like a black and white corgi.

1976
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,020
And I have a Yorkie.

1977
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,780
And she's very territorial.

1978
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,680
And she's not trained around dogs.

1979
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,060
So the lady came up to me and she was like...

1980
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,420
Is it okay?

1981
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,340
I'm like, I'm not gonna say no!

1982
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,100
And she was like, I don't know.

1983
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,220
And then they kind of like smelled each other's nose.

1984
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:56,340
I was like, aww.

1985
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,280
And as they're connecting...

1986
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,320
This damn rock wall that comes out of nowhere.

1987
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:01,580
And...

1988
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,460
Wait, where the fuck did the wrong one come from?

1989
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,520
The third party!

1990
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:06,620
I don't know.

1991
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,900
He came out of nowhere and he started...

1992
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,120
barking and pulling his owner hard.

1993
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,020
And my dog got scared.

1994
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,300
And that lady's dog got scared.

1995
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,820
And the friendship kind of like separated.

1996
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,040
And I was like, fuck!

1997
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,460
This is the perfect connection!

1998
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,920
So, K, did you get her number?

1999
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,300
No.

2000
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:22,700
No.

2001
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,280
Did you not get the old lady's number?

2002
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,300
No.

2003
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,040
She'll understand!

2004
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,220
The old lady's like...

2005
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,340
You're not into gills.

2006
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,620
She'll understand.

2007
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:31,980
Fuck!

2008
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:32,420
No!

2009
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,040
But you don't care.

2010
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,320
You don't care about your dog.

2011
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,940
I care about my dog.

2012
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:39,940
You'd rather your dog be a loner forever.

2013
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,040
She has two people!

2014
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,060
People are dogs!

2015
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,580
That's different!

2016
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,560
She's about to get a companion.

2017
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,900
I'm about to get a cat also.

2018
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,940
Cats are not dogs!

2019
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,780
They want dog friends!

2020
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,400
They want dog friends!

2021
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:56,440
They want dog friends!

2022
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,960
What if your only friend was a dog?

2023
01:13:59,300 --> 01:13:59,380
What if your only friend was a dog?

2024
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:02,020
I mean, isn't that how it is?

2025
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,320
Oh, you have no friends?

2026
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,420
Oh, you have no friends?

2027
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:04,740
Right?

2028
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,980
Man's best friend is a dog.

2029
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,600
You're not even friends with your girlfriend?

2030
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,600
But we were talking about the dog.

2031
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,820
Why we went backwards?

2032
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,320
You said, what if I was the only friend to the dog?

2033
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:22,000
It's like saying, would you just want one friend that's not even a human?

2034
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:27,080
I mean, personally, with issues that humans have, yes, I'd be okay with having a dog as a friend.

2035
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,620
So, like, not even a girl.

2036
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,820
Like, you don't even want your girlfriend to be your friend.

2037
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,860
I do, I do, but excluding her because automatically she's my friend that's my girl.

2038
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,100
So she's my girlfriend.

2039
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,300
Yeah, but your dog doesn't even have like a girlfriend!

2040
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,720
Like a girlfriend or a boyfriend.

2041
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,680
Well, because she doesn't want nobody to come around her.

2042
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,680
You don't know that!

2043
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,080
We do know that!

2044
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:47,300
What if she wants...

2045
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:47,300
What if she wants...

2046
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:47,300
We do know that!

2047
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,080
What if she wants a boyfriend?

2048
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,980
What if she wants a boyfriend?

2049
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,080
What if she wants babies?

2050
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,000
She can't have any.

2051
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,780
Yeah, because you took away her choice.

2052
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,020
I didn't.

2053
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,000
I didn't.

2054
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:00,940
I didn't.

2055
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:01,820
I wasn't the one.

2056
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,780
Make sure you take the UAB card.

2057
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,200
I got you.

2058
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,580
The one for people or the one for circle?

2059
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:13,480
People, people.

2060
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,220
That's the one I always got.

2061
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,760
I got you.

2062
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,020
Go Elysium with me, Zero.

2063
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,360
And then Faye and Doki, you guys go Hydra.

2064
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,000
Alright.

2065
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:27,380
Perfect.

2066
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:27,740
Cool.

2067
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,600
I'm down with it.

2068
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:32,120
I'll land southside, you go northside, Elysium.

2069
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:32,800
Please!

2070
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,720
I just hope we're not contested.

2071
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,860
I'm gonna land on this side.

2072
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,240
You have a spy banner here.

2073
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,280
Alright, yeah, I'll land on that far left then.

2074
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:46,420
I feel attacked.

2075
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:47,300
I feel attacked.

2076
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,240
That was so good.

2077
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:49,700
You're attacked!

2078
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,340
You poor dog!

2079
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,040
Wait, why am I jump faster?

2080
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:55,960
Shit, okay.

2081
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,000
I didn't even realize.

2082
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:00,020
Hey.

2083
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,820
Sorry, I got so absorbed over the fucking die conversation.

2084
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,860
I didn't even realize I was jump faster.

2085
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,400
Can you sound my forehead?

2086
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,240
Sure.

2087
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:13,880
Alright, appreciate that.

2088
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,040
I'm gonna go back.

2089
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,300
It's okay.

2090
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,940
We already bonded.

2091
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,860
This team doesn't care as much.

2092
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,960
We're running what we're looking for.

2093
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,580
Snipers are good.

2094
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,380
Alright, we're missing.

2095
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:29,780
We're missing.

2096
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,460
AR one trip.

2097
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,520
I'm lost.

2098
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,620
Sorry for your loss.

2099
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:36,920
Alright.

2100
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:37,680
Oh my god.

2101
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,160
We're finally within zone.

2102
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,920
Thank fucking god.

2103
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,060
I feel like we didn't get zone.

2104
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:47,900
I think another issue is we didn't get fucking zone.

2105
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:50,460
It's okay guys.

2106
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,220
Dad's also neutered.

2107
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:56,620
There's an evac here.

2108
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,980
I hate you.

2109
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,460
Nice little oasis there.

2110
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,140
I like it.

2111
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:07,880
Shit.

2112
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,300
Are you gonna take that?

2113
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,640
You got that cash?

2114
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,420
So...

2115
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:15,240
Yeah.

2116
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:16,820
Alright.

2117
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:20,540
Yeah, I took away dad's choice too.

2118
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,940
I thought you were calling UAV.

2119
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,180
People call it man scan and all that weird shit.

2120
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,320
I mean, it's just a UAV to me.

2121
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:33,600
Do we want cooldown or rapid response?

2122
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,880
The faster res.

2123
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:36,440
Alright.

2124
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,420
Alright, here you guys go.

2125
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,700
So we got a team here.

2126
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,740
And really nobody around us.

2127
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:47,320
Holy shit.

2128
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:47,840
It's okay.

2129
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:50,220
He got neutered when he was super young.

2130
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,340
So he didn't realize what he's lost.

2131
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:52,820
Or any energy attachments.

2132
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:56,100
I'm gonna grab nemesis.

2133
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,880
I know like Havoc's better.

2134
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,360
There's actually one on me.

2135
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:05,820
He didn't know what he's lost if he got neutered as a child.

2136
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,200
Alright, I'll just put a zipline there.

2137
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:09,780
I'm gonna hold this turbo.

2138
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,680
Wasn't there a Havoc somewhere?

2139
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,200
Okay, not child child.

2140
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,200
I did the recommended doctor suggestion.

2141
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,440
The doctor suggested a recommended amount and I did that.

2142
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:18,700
The doctor suggested a recommended amount and I did that.

2143
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,760
Do you want me to hit this UAV again?

2144
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:22,040
Do you want me to hit this UAV again?

2145
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:22,420
Yes.

2146
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:24,420
Gotcha.

2147
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,710
Alright.

2148
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:31,710
Let's check out that area.

2149
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:36,690
Let's start working our way into Oasis.

2150
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:36,870
Let's start working our way into Oasis.

2151
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:37,930
Wait, where's the SNT?

2152
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:38,670
There's a team coming.

2153
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:41,530
Yeah, we're fine.

2154
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,770
I see where you guys pinged the SNT.

2155
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:49,850
There is one over here.

2156
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,070
Where are we supposed to go?

2157
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,010
Towards Oasis.

2158
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:53,870
Like on the left side.

2159
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,470
Does anyone need bats?

2160
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:57,990
I have six.

2161
01:18:58,710 --> 01:18:59,410
I have one.

2162
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:03,170
Are you guys good?

2163
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:04,410
Yeah, we're good.

2164
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:05,490
Where do you want to go?

2165
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:07,390
Keep going left side over here.

2166
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:09,790
I'm a refrigerator.

2167
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:10,450
I don't want to get shot.

2168
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:14,250
Alright.

2169
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:16,310
Guys, I need to rebuy my push to talk.

2170
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:17,250
My push to talk is melee.

2171
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:18,370
I don't know if you guys noticed that.

2172
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:23,110
Every time I'm melee, I'm pushing the talk.

2173
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:25,190
I also need shield cells.

2174
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,650
I couldn't find any.

2175
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:29,930
I got four right here.

2176
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:30,890
Alright, thank you.

2177
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,390
Alright, thank you.

2178
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:37,130
Right next to the company.

2179
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:39,730
Oh, we're good.

2180
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:41,210
Are they right here?

2181
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:41,330
Yeah.

2182
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:41,910
I'm going to try to get over there.

2183
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,110
Oh my god.

2184
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,170
I poofed on them.

2185
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:48,410
I have no science.

2186
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:51,470
Can we evac once over here and go to Oasis?

2187
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:53,310
Yeah, I'm dropping the evac.

2188
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:54,570
Alright.

2189
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:57,090
Team flying to Oasis.

2190
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:57,730
Yeah.

2191
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,670
There's a team pushing that already.

2192
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:03,990
Oh, that's not great.

2193
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:06,350
Can we go longer?

2194
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:08,510
Right there.

2195
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:09,290
I'm right there on my ping.

2196
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:10,030
You guys can make it.

2197
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:14,210
I'm going to smoke off the left and we drop down on the right and take the zip.

2198
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:14,790
Okay.

2199
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:18,170
Ah, bitch.

2200
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:19,430
Just go right.

2201
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,350
I'm the last person.

2202
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:23,710
There's a guy under here.

2203
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:24,990
One guy is alone.

2204
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,110
You kill him.

2205
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:26,990
I missed everything.

2206
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:31,110
Set up on both sides.

2207
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:31,730
Make sure we don't get pushed.

2208
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:38,710
I'm going to just lurk around and see if we can get any picks.

2209
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:39,990
Is that a sniper scope?

2210
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:40,890
I'm coming right back.

2211
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:44,910
It is.

2212
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:46,470
It is.

2213
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,690
I'm bringing up a site for you guys.

2214
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:49,590
Sir.

2215
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:50,330
If anybody needs it.

2216
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:51,610
Appreciate it.

2217
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,750
What would you prefer?

2218
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:55,550
Bruiser or 2-4?

2219
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,590
Bruiser.

2220
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,210
Alright, Merry Christmas.

2221
01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:59,350
Thank you.

2222
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:00,330
No problem.

2223
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:03,270
Hey, a team died already.

2224
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:03,730
Not last.

2225
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:04,950
Yay!

2226
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:07,770
So sorry.

2227
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:08,610
I think I know the circle.

2228
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:09,930
I think it's the circle that's here.

2229
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:11,310
On this wall.

2230
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:12,870
The circle that's over here.

2231
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:14,090
Okay.

2232
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:17,690
Or it might be the circle that's in this area.

2233
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:23,430
Yeah, we can't really take the zips unless we get lucky and 3P a fight.

2234
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:26,330
So we're going to play up into these stairs eventually.

2235
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,450
Perfect.

2236
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:28,730
Hi.

2237
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:30,450
Oh, there's a team here.

2238
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,830
I hear a lot of fights.

2239
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:34,930
I'm going to go in the back.

2240
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:36,330
I'm waiting around this wall.

2241
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:37,170
Yeah.

2242
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:39,310
This team is getting fought above us somewhere.

2243
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:43,990
I'm looking to our left.

2244
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,220
Alright, I'm going to charge my sentry up.

2245
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,680
See if I can get a knucklehead in the head.

2246
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:55,300
Guys.

2247
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,160
I should not have made melee push to talk.

2248
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:58,900
I didn't see anything about you.

2249
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,580
Not really.

2250
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:05,240
That was a very bad decision on my end.

2251
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:06,320
Me too.

2252
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:06,620
Oh, okay.

2253
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:08,380
Oh shit.

2254
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,000
I'm going back down.

2255
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:10,640
Whoa.

2256
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,160
I'm going to watch the bottom.

2257
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:14,860
90.

2258
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:17,060
Please don't fall from that.

2259
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,220
I thought about it.

2260
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,980
That's why I stopped so quick.

2261
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,720
I'm scared.

2262
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,400
I'm scared.

2263
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,040
Every time I push to talk, I melee and it pushes me forward.

2264
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:27,940
Hahaha.

2265
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,280
Oh my god.

2266
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:33,560
What if I accidentally fall?

2267
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,480
Probably unbind that.

2268
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,220
Yeah.

2269
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,200
I chose the wrong bindings.

2270
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,920
You got a foot pedal?

2271
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,380
No, what the fuck?

2272
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,080
Last time I played Apex was two weeks ago.

2273
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:45,800
Hahaha.

2274
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,100
You should get one.

2275
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,620
It's like two bucks on Amazon.

2276
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,920
I am lagging really badly.

2277
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:53,180
Uh oh.

2278
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,520
I have 50k of loss.

2279
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,680
Oh no.

2280
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,040
How are you lagging?

2281
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:58,740
It's going down.

2282
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,100
It's going down.

2283
01:22:59,220 --> 01:22:59,660
We're good.

2284
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:00,520
Nice.

2285
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,340
You got anybody in the house on the internet?

2286
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,140
Are you playing wifi?

2287
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:07,940
No, I'm hardware.

2288
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,520
I mean my boyfriend is overwatching.

2289
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,100
Oh my god.

2290
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,040
Tell him to fucking uninstall right now.

2291
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:14,860
Exactly.

2292
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,900
What the fuck is he doing?

2293
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,480
That's not even worth playing right now.

2294
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,400
At least he's playing rank, right?

2295
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,020
What's his rank?

2296
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,040
That means he's not even good if you don't even know his rank.

2297
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,160
Damn.

2298
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,200
Damn.

2299
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:30,900
Damn.

2300
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,900
If you knew his rank, you'd be proud of it.

2301
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:36,320
You know.

2302
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,120
I don't know what it is.

2303
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:39,720
Yeah, yeah.

2304
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:40,800
Damn.

2305
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:44,940
Even my girlfriend knows my rank.

2306
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:45,940
Hahaha.

2307
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:47,220
Hahaha.

2308
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:50,840
I have a bad girlfriend.

2309
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:51,380
It's okay.

2310
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:52,240
I'll admit it.

2311
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,060
I'll admit it.

2312
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:54,120
No, no, no.

2313
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:54,940
It's okay.

2314
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,700
Oh shit.

2315
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,000
I have a bad girlfriend.

2316
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:00,680
Hahaha.

2317
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:02,640
Hahaha.

2318
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,880
Can we get a switch on teams, please?

2319
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:07,520
Hahaha.

2320
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,060
Hahaha.

2321
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:12,620
Damn.

2322
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,480
Doesn't even know.

2323
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:15,340
Hahaha.

2324
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,780
That poor guy.

2325
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,640
That poor guy worked so hard.

2326
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,100
Hahaha.

2327
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,060
He thought his girlfriend was proud of him.

2328
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,960
But she doesn't even know he exists.

2329
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:27,920
Hahaha.

2330
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,680
I'll make an involved.

2331
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,560
Should I anchor or come with you guys?

2332
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,560
Anchor for now.

2333
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:35,700
They're like fighting above.

2334
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:36,460
They're like on roof.

2335
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:36,800
Yeah.

2336
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,520
Yeah, come to me.

2337
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,340
Should I come over?

2338
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,040
Yeah.

2339
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,820
I hear people behind me.

2340
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,640
They're peaking over.

2341
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,660
Oh my God.

2342
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:51,900
No.

2343
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:52,960
No.

2344
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,380
Guys, I don't think that was smart gas.

2345
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,000
Oh my god, there were so many teams!

2346
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,360
Yeah, I think we should have held that.

2347
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,440
I think we should have stayed, yeah.

2348
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:13,740
Because look at the circle now.

2349
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:18,380
We would have been comfortable for like two more circles.

2350
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,460
Oh my god, we were!

2351
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,400
Yeah, I was right about that circle.

2352
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:26,580
It ends like... it's gonna end in that corner.

2353
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,520
That top left corner, that top bottom corner.

2354
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,020
I mean, placements matter more than kills.

2355
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,040
Yeah.

2356
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,820
Because that's when you get your $100.

2357
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,440
It's okay, I can finally rebind my stuff.

2358
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,460
Alright, I'll be back.

2359
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,260
Alright, time to rebind.

2360
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,280
Give me a sec, guys.

2361
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,920
Alright, instead of melee, I'm gonna put it on a different binding.

2362
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:49,780
Oh my god.

2363
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,340
This is...

2364
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,360
How do people do this?

2365
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:56,480
How do Overwatch players...

2366
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,580
No, sorry, not Overwatch.

2367
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,540
How do Apex players do this?

2368
01:25:59,700 --> 01:25:59,920
Okay.

2369
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:03,060
Alright, now it's my weapon swap.

2370
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:04,300
Now it's better.

2371
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,060
Now it's not...

2372
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,140
Now I don't... it's not when I'm meleeing.

2373
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,960
At least it's not...

2374
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,340
I don't wanna get a foot pedal.

2375
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:24,360
Foot pedal, you still have to bind it on something.

2376
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,220
Don't you?

2377
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:27,960
The foot pedal isn't like... a whole new bind.

2378
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,560
It's not a whole new fucking bind though.

2379
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,300
It's a weapon swap, so like...

2380
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,820
I... oh wait, that could be worse, you're right.

2381
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:42,080
Fuck, what do people use?

2382
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:45,460
Control?

2383
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:48,360
But like, then I'll be crouching while I'm talking!

2384
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:49,600
Like...

2385
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,060
Caps lock!

2386
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,220
Wait, you're so right!

2387
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:58,880
I'm gonna do caps lock, okay.

2388
01:26:59,300 --> 01:26:59,780
Alright.

2389
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,600
I'm gonna rebind it on caps lock.

2390
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:07,020
I'm so not... cause I'm usually used to using mouse... mouse bindings.

2391
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:09,900
Um... mouse bindings for it.

2392
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:12,720
And like, my mouse bindings are binded to stuff already.

2393
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,760
So, that's why like...

2394
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,960
Cause I use like push to talk for like...

2395
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,480
Mouse 3 or mouse 4.

2396
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,400
So it's like... I'm so not used to binding it outside of it.

2397
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:24,700
Um...

2398
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:25,940
Okay, caps lock.

2399
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:26,740
Alright.

2400
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,100
Nothing can go wrong with caps lock, guys.

2401
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,460
Nothing can go wrong with caps lock.

2402
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:34,640
Look...

2403
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,460
Our... our pro players through...

2404
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:40,980
We literally had like... such a free...

2405
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,300
We were so free!

2406
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:42,680
Wait!

2407
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,680
What the fuck!

2408
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,040
We were actually so free!

2409
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,500
He like told us to rotate!

2410
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:51,600
Oh!

2411
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:52,660
My Discord crashed.

2412
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,080
Oh my gosh.

2413
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:56,540
Looks like Discord has crashed.

2414
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:57,780
Oh shit!

2415
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,500
Oh shit!

2416
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,480
Why did my... Why did my Discord crash?

2417
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,680
Wait, is Discord down for everybody?

2418
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,720
No, it's just me.

2419
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:08,820
What the fuck?

2420
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,200
Is it just me?

2421
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,380
Did everybody else's Discord also crash or is it just me?

2422
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:14,040
I can't tell!

2423
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,700
I can't tell!

2424
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:17,900
I can't tell!

2425
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:18,140
No!

2426
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,880
I don't have PC Discord!

2427
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:24,020
No!

2428
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:25,340
It's alright.

2429
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:25,880
Thank God.

2430
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,760
I hope everybody else's Discord crashed too.

2431
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,100
It... It says...

2432
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:31,980
Um...

2433
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,580
It says like...

2434
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:36,580
Um... I can't reload desktop Discord at the moment.

2435
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:37,260
It just says...

2436
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:38,000
This is awkward.

2437
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:40,040
Looks like Discord has crashed unexpectedly.

2438
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,680
We've tracked the error and we'll get right to it.

2439
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,380
Okay, let me... Let me try and reboot Discord.

2440
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:47,820
It really better.

2441
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,880
I'm... I'm bind... I'm binded it but...

2442
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:51,620
Yeah, I can't...

2443
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:51,920
What?

2444
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:53,900
The fuck?

2445
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,600
Okay, that's weird.

2446
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:57,680
Alright.

2447
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,660
Where's my task manager?

2448
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,920
Do I not have task manager?

2449
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,600
Oh, there it is.

2450
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:03,240
Is that task manager?

2451
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:03,680
Okay.

2452
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:04,780
Discord.

2453
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:06,720
Oh God.

2454
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:10,460
Okay, I'm not using... Okay, I'm gonna...

2455
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:11,960
Close...

2456
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,740
How do I... Oh my gosh, I don't know how to use Windows 11.

2457
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,000
I...

2458
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:16,840
What the fuck?

2459
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:17,060
Okay.

2460
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:17,640
And task.

2461
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:18,460
Okay.

2462
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:19,960
Alright.

2463
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,820
Time to reboot Discord.

2464
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,200
Did it work?

2465
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,140
Checking for updates.

2466
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:29,720
Starting?

2467
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,120
Yay!

2468
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,560
Did it work?

2469
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:33,020
Yay!

2470
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:34,320
Okay.

2471
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:38,640
I did not leave the... I did not rage quit my team.

2472
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,800
My Discord crashed.

2473
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:41,260
Alright.

2474
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,260
Okay, I'm back.

2475
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:43,900
Nice.

2476
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:44,860
Alright.

2477
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,560
It's okay.

2478
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,160
They didn't even notice I was gone.

2479
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:48,520
That's okay.

2480
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,180
I don't know what caused it.

2481
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:57,240
It just crashed.

2482
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,440
I don't know.

2483
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,000
I can't believe it.

2484
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:01,820
It's not me.

2485
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,960
Saucer, like, placed... got first and also placed in his last two games.

2486
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:11,440
And now he makes a poor IGL decision?

2487
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:13,440
It's not me.

2488
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,240
That's all... all I'm saying.

2489
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:26,780
All I'm saying is that we should have... I stayed.

2490
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,040
I anchored.

2491
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,140
I made the right decision on staying.

2492
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:32,940
And then my...

2493
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:34,480
We were in end zone!

2494
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,100
No!

2495
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,240
We could have lived there!

2496
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:47,040
We could have lived...

2497
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,160
What do you mean I mind broke two people?

2498
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,240
I had a legitimate argument.

2499
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:57,360
Dogs want more than... dogs want other dog friends.

2500
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,340
Like...

2501
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:05,500
Because only a dog would understand another fellow dog.

2502
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,980
Like... it is a legitimate argument.

2503
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,400
Does...

2504
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:13,640
Yes!

2505
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,100
Dad has friends.

2506
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,720
Of course he does!

2507
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:18,480
Because I'm not a monster.

2508
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,140
He actually does!

2509
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:26,340
He...

2510
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,440
Every time we take him to the salon.

2511
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:29,580
He has...

2512
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:30,420
He has his friends.

2513
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:36,020
Yes!

2514
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,180
He has friends other than me.

2515
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:39,960
Don't...

2516
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,000
I'm saying it.

2517
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,720
I fixed...

2518
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,620
Yeah, I fixed my keyboard.

2519
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,240
All I'm saying is that...

2520
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,160
I like...

2521
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:49,240
My favorite part was like...

2522
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:49,960
We're getting a cat!

2523
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:50,480
And I'm like...

2524
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,520
A cat's not a dog!

2525
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,120
So anyway...

2526
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,680
All I'm saying is that my argument is a legitimate argument.

2527
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:04,180
To have...

2528
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:04,740
Like...

2529
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,980
Dogs need to be socialized to have...

2530
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:07,640
That's why...

2531
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,600
That's why some dogs are like...

2532
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:09,940
Extra...

2533
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:10,380
Extra aggressive!

2534
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,840
Because like...

2535
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:12,460
They don't...

2536
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,920
They've never socialized with other dogs before.

2537
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,480
So they don't know how to handle other dogs.

2538
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:19,020
Because they don't never...

2539
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:19,480
Uh...

2540
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,420
They've never like...

2541
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:22,700
Actually encountered other fellow dogs.

2542
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,700
So they're like...

2543
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:24,240
There's peop...

2544
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,540
There's animals other than myself?

2545
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:29,820
See?

2546
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:30,900
True!

2547
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,220
I told you!

2548
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,460
I knew...

2549
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,260
I told you!

2550
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,820
Now you guys see my side!

2551
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:37,220
Um...

2552
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,160
A lot of dogs that tend to be like...

2553
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:39,880
Super hyper...

2554
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:40,280
Super aggressive.

2555
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:41,520
Tends to be like...

2556
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,120
Dogs that haven't been able to socialize...

2557
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:44,920
Um...

2558
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,680
When they are younger.

2559
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,820
They just...

2560
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,680
They've just been like...

2561
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:50,800
Uh...

2562
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,460
They just like...

2563
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,240
They don't know how to react with other...

2564
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,740
Other canines too.

2565
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:58,440
Isn't dad aggressive towards children and old people?

2566
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:58,760
Yes!

2567
01:32:58,760 --> 01:32:59,480
Because they're children!

2568
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:00,080
And...

2569
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:00,320
Okay.

2570
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:00,540
No.

2571
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,080
I shouldn't...

2572
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,560
That's not a good excuse.

2573
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:02,920
Um...

2574
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:04,780
Because dad sees...

2575
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:04,920
He's like...

2576
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,280
He's like...

2577
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:07,920
He's like...

2578
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:08,800
He's like...

2579
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:08,980
He's like...

2580
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:09,540
He's like...

2581
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:11,820
Dad sees a child and was like...

2582
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,140
I can take them.

2583
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,320
No.

2584
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:20,880
No.

2585
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:21,560
Keep going.

2586
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:22,200
Keep...

2587
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:22,620
No.

2588
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:23,420
No, Doki.

2589
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,020
Keep going.

2590
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:26,800
Elaborate on what you mean by...

2591
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,480
Because they're children.

2592
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:29,520
Um...

2593
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:32,880
Okay.

2594
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:34,300
Dad...

2595
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:35,040
Dad...

2596
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,160
Hates...

2597
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,160
Men...

2598
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,520
Kids...

2599
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:39,520
And the elderly.

2600
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,520
Um...

2601
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:41,720
It...

2602
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:43,660
Uh...

2603
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:49,040
But he's fine with other dogs.

2604
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:50,120
Okay?

2605
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:51,180
He's...

2606
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:53,280
He's fine with other dogs.

2607
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,560
That's what the conversation is about.

2608
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:59,660
He's okay with other dogs.

2609
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,440
He just has a type.

2610
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,300
Exactly.

2611
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:09,200
He just...

2612
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:09,500
He's okay with other dogs.

2613
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,260
He has...

2614
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,640
He has a type when it comes to humans.

2615
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,080
Um...

2616
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:14,580
That's...

2617
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:14,920
No.

2618
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:15,620
No.

2619
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,240
That's not almost everyone.

2620
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:19,300
Because he doesn't hate women.

2621
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,000
He loves women.

2622
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:22,980
Yeah.

2623
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:23,760
Women.

2624
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:27,480
Oh.

2625
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:28,460
Women.

2626
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:31,380
No.

2627
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,780
He actually likes all types of women.

2628
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,480
Just not kids and the elderly.

2629
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,820
Just not children.

2630
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:38,520
Just not...

2631
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:38,860
Just not...

2632
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:39,320
Just not...

2633
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:39,500
Just not...

2634
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,300
Same.

2635
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,200
Of course.

2636
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:41,880
Yay!

2637
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:42,660
Women!

2638
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:46,740
He's just like me.

2639
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:49,500
Look.

2640
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,720
He has a type.

2641
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:51,240
Okay?

2642
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,060
So...

2643
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:53,720
Pick him.

2644
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,280
What about...

2645
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:54,820
Um...

2646
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:57,900
When he hit a certain point of old, he doesn't like them.

2647
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,400
So, like...

2648
01:34:59,400 --> 01:34:59,980
Um...

2649
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:02,820
It just depends on, like, how old...

2650
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:03,900
How old they are.

2651
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,160
This is not all...

2652
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:08,320
I don't win for women.

2653
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:09,100
Hahaha.

2654
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:13,500
Dad is my spirit animal.

2655
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:18,500
Okay.

2656
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,380
Round two.

2657
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:24,320
Round two, guys.

2658
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,520
Sharko, thank you for the super chat.

2659
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:28,880
Thank you.

2660
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,260
Thank you.

2661
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,500
Dad doesn't love hags.

2662
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:30,720
Look.

2663
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,600
At a certain age.

2664
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:32,140
Okay?

2665
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:33,360
Okay.

2666
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:35,180
But, like, what age is a hag?

2667
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,260
Some of you guys will say 30 equals hag.

2668
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:39,380
So, like...

2669
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,780
Like, I feel like...

2670
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:42,900
I feel like dad is, like...

2671
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:43,180
Okay.

2672
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,480
There's, like, a certain point.

2673
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:45,100
I feel, like...

2674
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:46,260
60.

2675
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:46,920
Maybe.

2676
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:48,720
The moment you look like...

2677
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,040
Look like you're...

2678
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,300
Old, old, then dad's like...

2679
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:52,900
Um...

2680
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:53,800
Hahaha.

2681
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,000
Hahaha.

2682
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:57,860
Hahaha.

2683
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,060
Hahaha.

2684
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:58,740
Hahaha.

2685
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:04,260
Okay.

2686
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:05,280
Because, I know...

2687
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,780
Because, like, some of you guys are, like, 40.

2688
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:11,240
But yet, like, you categorized mint as a hag.

2689
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,280
And, like, I fucking hope to God she's not...

2690
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:14,960
Hahaha.

2691
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:16,300
Hahaha.

2692
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:16,720
Hahaha.

2693
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:17,440
Hahaha.

2694
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,020
Hahaha.

2695
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:21,080
I think I don't think mince 40.

2696
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:24,340
I don't think mince 40.

2697
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:35,000
Hag IRL versus hag online.

2698
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:41,400
Okay, what's the age for an online hag versus an IRL hag?

2699
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:45,320
I was like, I hope she is 40.

2700
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:58,020
And okay, online hag is 30.

2701
01:36:58,860 --> 01:36:59,540
Jesus.

2702
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,840
Alright, if you remember the 90s, you're a hag.

2703
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,020
What's the male equivalent of a hag?

2704
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:12,120
Actually, what's the male equivalent of a hag?

2705
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,700
Because that's the female equivalent.

2706
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:19,700
Orc?

2707
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:20,920
Silver.

2708
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:24,180
Gramps?

2709
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:26,320
Alright, how are we looking?

2710
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,400
I don't think... I don't think... oh wait.

2711
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,720
I think we're pretty... we're doing alright.

2712
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:34,980
Alright, same comp?

2713
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,160
Yep.

2714
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,060
Heezer?

2715
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,440
Is that OG-san?

2716
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:48,400
Why do you guys get the good ones?

2717
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,940
It's like fucking OG-san and fucking hag.

2718
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:54,680
Anybody else has a small dog or no?

2719
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:54,960
Heezer.

2720
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,320
I have a small dog and he has friends.

2721
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,260
Wow, heezer.

2722
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:00,800
I'm putting it out there now.

2723
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,280
I'm a different shepherd.

2724
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:06,480
You got a guard dog.

2725
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:08,300
I got a big girl.

2726
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:09,620
Aww.

2727
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:12,020
Does your dog have friends?

2728
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:15,540
Well, does your dog know your boyfriend's rank?

2729
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:20,320
I mean, he's technically his dog, so I would assume.

2730
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,500
Oh, she definitely knows that.

2731
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:23,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2732
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,580
Oh wait, it's not even your dog.

2733
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:26,880
Damn.

2734
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:34,320
Cause like, you know, if you saw that dog as yours, you wouldn't say my boyfriend's dog.

2735
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:35,380
You'd be like, our dog.

2736
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:40,400
You wouldn't like specifically name that the dog is not even yours.

2737
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:42,820
You know what's crazy?

2738
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,840
He brought her with him.

2739
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:45,860
You know what's crazy?

2740
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,080
I don't mean to like, you know, chime on this, but that's my girlfriend's dog and I said it's my dog.

2741
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:51,900
Yeah, see?

2742
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,920
He claimed the dog as his as well.

2743
01:38:56,980 --> 01:39:00,180
It's an our thing, not a his thing.

2744
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,020
I call her my dog.

2745
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,020
Sometimes I say his dog.

2746
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:10,760
That shouldn't even be a thought in your head.

2747
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,120
Damn.

2748
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,100
I feel bad.

2749
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:20,720
Hey, at least I give her the treats.

2750
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:21,420
He doesn't.

2751
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,040
Whoa.

2752
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,720
Whoa, and yet you don't even accept it as yours.

2753
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,980
They hate her for she spoke the truth.

2754
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:36,480
So did you, did you ask your boyfriend what his rank is?

2755
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:37,820
No.

2756
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:39,660
Oh my God.

2757
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:40,480
You haven't checked that one?

2758
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,840
You didn't even like check after we called you out.

2759
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:43,340
He's fine.

2760
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:48,040
You're not even embarrassed that you don't know and you didn't even try to fix it.

2761
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:51,080
Wait, what's the bottom rank of, uh, what's the bottom rank?

2762
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,120
What if he dropped to the bottom rank?

2763
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:55,160
Yeah.

2764
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:57,420
What if he needs you to comfort him right now?

2765
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:58,860
What if he's crying right now?

2766
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:00,300
What if the boys are making fun of him?

2767
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:00,680
Yeah.

2768
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:06,620
What if like they're watching the stream right now and they're like, oh my God, your girlfriend doesn't even know your rank.

2769
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:07,840
Right.

2770
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:08,920
Wait.

2771
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:09,680
Crazy.

2772
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:11,300
I got this.

2773
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:14,520
He's just sitting there taking it all in like I don't even want to do this no more.

2774
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:14,700
Yeah.

2775
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:19,120
He's just, maybe he stopped playing Overwatch and you didn't even know.

2776
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:19,980
Right.

2777
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:22,220
What rank are you?

2778
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:27,800
Yes.

2779
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:28,640
He's gold too.

2780
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:31,260
Oh my, no wonder you don't want to know his rank.

2781
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:35,980
Damn.

2782
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:36,380
Damn.

2783
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:38,720
You shouldn't even have told us that.

2784
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,780
I was catching strings for not knowing it.

2785
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:45,160
You shouldn't even have told us his rank if he's gold one.

2786
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:46,320
Damn.

2787
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:55,070
No one is safe.

2788
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:58,510
I like how through all of this, Sorcerer has just been quiet.

2789
01:40:58,730 --> 01:40:58,750
Is that good?

2790
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:00,570
Bro, he's not even gold one, he's gold two.

2791
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:02,890
Cause he doesn't want to get roasted.

2792
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:03,670
He's scared.

2793
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:05,490
Oh, damn.

2794
01:41:07,530 --> 01:41:09,510
Did you just catwood me?

2795
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:09,950
I'm getting roasted here.

2796
01:41:09,950 --> 01:41:10,790
It's the same stuff.

2797
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:20,030
Yeah, I can't wait for the Pathy recolor heirloom.

2798
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:21,150
Oh my god.

2799
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:23,110
Stop, he's already dead.

2800
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:26,430
It'd be nice to have like all gold boxing gloves.

2801
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:27,790
I thought Duke was going to improve this.

2802
01:41:27,930 --> 01:41:29,390
Hey, we're having a good time.

2803
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:30,090
We're laughing.

2804
01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:31,550
That's how that matters.

2805
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:33,990
We're all having a good time.

2806
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,490
Guys, I need to let it all out.

2807
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,890
I was, I was, I was silenced earlier.

2808
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:44,930
So now I'm letting it all out.

2809
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:46,250
Is the G7 Warford this year or no?

2810
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:49,250
Yeah, it's pretty good.

2811
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:49,870
They like buffed it.

2812
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:52,610
No one is safe.

2813
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:57,050
Oh, hey.

2814
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:58,850
A blue flatline.

2815
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:00,070
I didn't know that was possible.

2816
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:04,310
Whoa.

2817
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:05,210
Oh my god, purple.

2818
01:42:05,570 --> 01:42:07,150
Oh my god, so good.

2819
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:09,750
Okay.

2820
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:13,130
Not that I'm being your vent.

2821
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:16,090
I need to let it out.

2822
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:18,110
I let out the aggression.

2823
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:19,490
Microaggression.

2824
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:22,810
I'm the type of person you call HR for.

2825
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:23,370
I have two blue badge numbers.

2826
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:29,060
Let's see.

2827
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:31,540
Are you winning?

2828
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:32,540
I'm not last.

2829
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:34,240
That's a win in my book.

2830
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,320
Bro, if I find another evac, I swear.

2831
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,560
Yeah.

2832
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:42,020
Okay.

2833
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:43,640
Let me find more shield cells.

2834
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:44,040
Ooh.

2835
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:45,920
I need that site.

2836
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:46,320
Ooh.

2837
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:47,400
Let's see.

2838
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:48,260
PTS.

2839
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,760
Oh, evac there.

2840
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:53,160
I swear.

2841
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,200
I'm just, I'm just being trolled.

2842
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:56,720
That's it.

2843
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:57,200
That's...

2844
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,380
That's what I'm understanding.

2845
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:01,060
I'm gonna go get the evo.

2846
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:01,860
Hmm.

2847
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:03,660
Let's see.

2848
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,640
I'm gonna make sure I have everything I need.

2849
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:08,040
Oh, I need to open this for loot.

2850
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,260
I like what I got.

2851
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:11,980
Is chat broken again?

2852
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:13,920
I don't know what's going on.

2853
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:14,940
It broke again.

2854
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,200
I got a keyboard.

2855
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:16,800
I got a keyboard.

2856
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,620
I need to go to phase driver for the main console.

2857
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:20,180
Yeah.

2858
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:22,260
Wait, is it...

2859
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:22,960
When did it break?

2860
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,740
Actually, I don't know this circle.

2861
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,500
If I'm not mistaken, it's the one that's like over here.

2862
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:29,620
Oh, is it?

2863
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:29,620
Oh!

2864
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:31,880
Oh, the overlay's broken too.

2865
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:33,560
Alright, I'll fix that later.

2866
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,280
I don't really have time to fix it at the moment.

2867
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,400
It seems already leaving phase, I believe.

2868
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,720
We could just evac over.

2869
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:44,240
Alright, I'm gonna grab this bat and then...

2870
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:45,760
What I need...

2871
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,120
I feel like I need more energy ammo.

2872
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,600
They're hitting the...

2873
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:52,340
Um...

2874
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:53,040
button.

2875
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,020
Phase driver.

2876
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:56,620
Yeah, I'm gonna drop an evac right here.

2877
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,840
Are we all gone?

2878
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,400
There's another evac here in the house.

2879
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:01,560
Here's two evacs.

2880
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:02,760
I'll grab that.

2881
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:04,020
I'm so far, but I'm coming.

2882
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:06,340
I don't know where to go.

2883
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,040
Where do we go?

2884
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:09,740
Oh, phase driver, phase driver.

2885
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:10,160
Oh, okay.

2886
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:11,680
Mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror.

2887
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:13,660
Weeeing.

2888
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:18,600
You wanna go backside?

2889
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:20,080
Yeah.

2890
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:23,780
Oh, since Discord crashed...

2891
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:24,900
Oh, Discord crashed the...

2892
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:27,020
Wait, did Discord crash the chat as well?

2893
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:29,900
Well, just scan UAV and ring console here and then keep going.

2894
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,240
Yep.

2895
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,480
I don't wanna win.

2896
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:36,280
I don't wanna win.

2897
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,100
I need energy ammo if you guys see any.

2898
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:40,160
Inside the building.

2899
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:40,600
Okay.

2900
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:45,420
Scanning.

2901
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:45,680
Scanning.

2902
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:47,500
We're doing okay.

2903
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:49,180
I'm gonna say that and we're gonna get fucking shit on.

2904
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:50,320
That smoke scared the fuck out of me.

2905
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,180
Do you still need energy?

2906
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:54,900
Uh, yeah.

2907
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:55,560
I only have some VA.

2908
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:57,060
Nice.

2909
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:58,940
I'm like kinda good now.

2910
01:44:59,040 --> 01:44:59,380
I have like 100.

2911
01:44:59,480 --> 01:44:59,800
Evac?

2912
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:00,480
Three stacks right here.

2913
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:01,260
Oh, so...

2914
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:02,480
Let's get this ring console.

2915
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:03,680
It sounds like kind of on us.

2916
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:06,160
Ooh.

2917
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:08,620
I'm scared.

2918
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:10,480
I got this evo cache on the right.

2919
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,760
So I got a sniper digi and I can see.

2920
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:13,460
I'm gonna go back to the base.

2921
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:15,100
There's a PK in here.

2922
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:18,980
Oh, there's a people over here.

2923
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:19,280
Uh, somebody over here.

2924
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,540
Yeah, there's people over there.

2925
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:22,040
I'm big balling them.

2926
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:23,220
So bang.

2927
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:24,140
Bang is going for care package.

2928
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:25,440
Wait, I can see in the.

2929
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:25,700
What?

2930
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:26,000
Hello?

2931
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:27,860
They can't.

2932
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:28,400
They nerfed it.

2933
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,520
No, I can see her.

2934
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:31,660
I can clearly see her in the.

2935
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:32,120
Yeah.

2936
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:33,300
I can still see her in the smoke.

2937
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:34,400
Yeah.

2938
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:35,220
What the hell?

2939
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:36,300
Are you telling us?

2940
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:36,680
Kill her.

2941
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,180
I've tried to.

2942
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:40,220
But she fucking Jiminy Quickens out here.

2943
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:42,160
I'm gonna pull up the hill.

2944
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:42,600
Kinda.

2945
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:43,040
Someone's coming.

2946
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:43,520
Someone's coming.

2947
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,180
Where are you going?

2948
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:51,420
Are we just chilling here for now?

2949
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,100
Yeah, we're chilling here.

2950
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,520
Just hold out our space over here.

2951
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:57,460
Bang drop.

2952
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,660
Just make sure no one comes in from the west side.

2953
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:02,800
I'm looking this direction.

2954
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:03,500
There's nobody there.

2955
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:04,340
That was an accident.

2956
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,480
Alright guys, I'm doing...

2957
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,020
Somebody sniped them in the head.

2958
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:12,160
I'm doing recon.

2959
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,500
I'm gonna make sure nobody's behind us.

2960
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,960
I'm being a good reconist.

2961
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,340
Guys, there's nobody here.

2962
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:21,780
Look at that.

2963
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:23,740
I should do that with cover.

2964
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:25,080
Yeah, they're coming to us!

2965
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:25,500
Coming to us!

2966
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:26,140
Where?

2967
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:27,760
Left side.

2968
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:28,960
Oh, okay.

2969
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:29,720
Oh, I see them!

2970
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:29,860
I see them!

2971
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,120
Blue, is there anyone?

2972
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:34,200
Oh...

2973
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:34,540
Reloading.

2974
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:37,260
I'm gonna wrap a little bit left.

2975
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:38,980
Yeah, they're wrapping left.

2976
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:39,300
They're right here.

2977
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:41,720
One's in smoke.

2978
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,300
Two are in smoke.

2979
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:43,260
Oh shit!

2980
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,600
I'm up on the building on the left over here.

2981
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:49,300
Yeah.

2982
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:50,600
I'm gonna shot in the back there.

2983
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:51,340
Yeah.

2984
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:53,480
Do I come to you guys?

2985
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,060
I don't see that team.

2986
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:58,500
I guess I do.

2987
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,540
They're the last team over here.

2988
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:02,220
I guess I do.

2989
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,840
Alright, I'm going a little bit back into circle.

2990
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,200
Someone hold this...

2991
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:08,840
I'll be.

2992
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:10,600
I got it.

2993
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,660
I'm dropping an EVEM.

2994
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:12,000
I'm gonna go back for it.

2995
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:13,980
Oh.

2996
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:15,420
Alright.

2997
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:17,100
They're still over here.

2998
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:17,880
We're still alive!

2999
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,980
Yeah, they're behind that big ass wall.

3000
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:20,540
I can't even see it.

3001
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:24,040
Eh.

3002
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:30,740
Oh!

3003
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,340
Who's shooting me?

3004
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:34,340
It's not good.

3005
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:35,560
I just realized I have four shield cells.

3006
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:38,140
Oh.

3007
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:38,560
I see them.

3008
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,000
55 on bang!

3009
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:41,680
Alright.

3010
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:41,980
I'm reloading.

3011
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:42,500
I'm reloading.

3012
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:42,780
I'm reloading.

3013
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:43,100
I'm reloading.

3014
01:47:43,100 --> 01:47:43,500
I'm reloading.

3015
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,040
I'm reloading.

3016
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:45,400
I'm reloading.

3017
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:45,580
I'm reloading.

3018
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:45,640
I'm reloading.

3019
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:45,860
Nice.

3020
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:49,820
Putting down my package.

3021
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:53,060
It's the non care package package.

3022
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,640
Non care package package.

3023
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,120
Like it.

3024
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,060
Look at that.

3025
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:03,080
So we're getting shot at, somebody's hiding right here, another person over here.

3026
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,640
I'm playing loft over here.

3027
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:04,880
Excuse me.

3028
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:05,180
I'm just getting angles.

3029
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:06,920
Here's a blue helmet for you.

3030
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:09,900
One of you guys has a white helmet.

3031
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:11,420
Got it.

3032
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:14,260
Alright, so I have the 50% zip line.

3033
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:15,440
Let me know where you want me to put it.

3034
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:15,620
One on the left.

3035
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:17,960
Save it for now.

3036
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:19,020
Alright.

3037
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:23,500
This one is going to be kind of rough for us.

3038
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:26,440
There is a redeploy over there.

3039
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:28,000
It's sad though.

3040
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:28,440
Oh, take it.

3041
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:33,180
Team, walk up with me Fae.

3042
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,200
We can maybe hit ring console again.

3043
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:35,560
I'm pretty sure that was this team.

3044
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,920
I'm looking to our right just in case.

3045
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:41,940
To our east.

3046
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:48,520
Yeah, that team is just still on that building.

3047
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:50,540
Long burn.

3048
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:53,400
Oh, never mind.

3049
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:54,560
Maybe just chill.

3050
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:54,920
Crack them.

3051
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:56,580
I'll re-smoke you any foe heal.

3052
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:57,820
You guys are good.

3053
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:58,320
You guys are good.

3054
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:02,140
I have a phoenix in the care package if you want it later.

3055
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:08,920
I don't have any vision on anybody.

3056
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:10,020
Whoa!

3057
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,420
It's all pulled far.

3058
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:15,600
Should we just hail Mary and some evacs?

3059
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:17,240
Can everyone hear me?

3060
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:18,080
Can everyone come to us with me here?

3061
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:19,960
Yeah, give me a second.

3062
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:20,620
Yeah.

3063
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:23,360
Fuck, it's not another UAV we could hit.

3064
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:23,920
That sucks.

3065
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,520
I'm going all around.

3066
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:27,280
Oh, shit.

3067
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:28,080
I fucked up.

3068
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:28,920
There's a...

3069
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:29,460
Whoa!

3070
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:30,120
There's a people here!

3071
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:30,580
There's people here!

3072
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:31,280
Over here!

3073
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:31,420
A team!

3074
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:32,300
Oh my god!

3075
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:32,680
I'm dead!

3076
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:33,260
Final?

3077
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:33,700
Yeah.

3078
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:34,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3079
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:34,940
I got a guy coming.

3080
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,560
They're pushing me, I think.

3081
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:39,680
They're pushing Doki.

3082
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:40,180
Yeah.

3083
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:42,280
Doki, I saw him.

3084
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:43,380
Doki, I saw him.

3085
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:43,960
I saw contact.

3086
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:44,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3087
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:47,300
Did you kill her?

3088
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:49,220
They're running over here.

3089
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:49,920
I don't know where they went.

3090
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:50,480
I don't know where they went.

3091
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:52,480
I just got shot and I got scared.

3092
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:53,240
Yeah, let's just go north.

3093
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,780
They kind of stole our rotate this time.

3094
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:55,380
Yeah.

3095
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:56,620
Oh my god.

3096
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:57,740
Where the fuck did that team come from?

3097
01:49:58,580 --> 01:49:59,500
I don't know.

3098
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,220
I just got scared and I inked.

3099
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:03,120
What?

3100
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:05,980
I put out my heal drone.

3101
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:06,840
I was so scared.

3102
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:08,700
All so scared.

3103
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,940
She said I got scared and I inked.

3104
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:14,420
What?

3105
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:16,240
I was so scared.

3106
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:17,220
I was defense mechanism.

3107
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,700
Try to walk through the terminal and get to my yellow ping.

3108
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:20,660
The buildings are there.

3109
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:21,440
We can.

3110
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:22,200
Team right here.

3111
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:22,640
Team right here.

3112
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:23,580
Wait.

3113
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:24,760
Okay.

3114
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,200
That's way too far.

3115
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:27,620
They don't know.

3116
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:28,160
They don't know.

3117
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:31,380
Shoot on the bang.

3118
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:31,940
Shoot on the bang.

3119
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:33,640
Okay, keep walking.

3120
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:34,700
Keep walking deep if we can.

3121
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:36,980
I don't know why there's shields here, but...

3122
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:38,100
Yo, I'm lagging.

3123
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:39,120
I'm lagging too.

3124
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:39,560
Yeah, I'm serving.

3125
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:41,240
Yeah, no, the server is dog shit.

3126
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:41,700
Keep in front of me.

3127
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:42,400
Hold team.

3128
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:42,640
Hold team.

3129
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,300
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3130
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:44,480
Come back.

3131
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:44,660
Come back.

3132
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:45,560
Oh, God.

3133
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:46,980
Oh, no.

3134
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:48,600
Come back to where we...

3135
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:50,060
Yeah, come back to the entrance we came from.

3136
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:51,560
Okay.

3137
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:52,760
I'm scared.

3138
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:53,000
Good luck.

3139
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:54,740
We're fine.

3140
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,220
All right, we're just going to evac here into the compound.

3141
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:00,040
All right.

3142
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:02,240
Wait.

3143
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:03,820
Somebody died to a ring.

3144
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,780
What a nerd.

3145
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:06,120
Ma'am.

3146
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:07,980
I'm going to tell them you said that.

3147
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,040
Where are we going?

3148
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:11,500
Yellow ping compound.

3149
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,820
I hope it's free, but I have no info.

3150
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:14,460
So...

3151
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:17,320
If it's taken to swerve, but it looks good to me.

3152
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:20,640
It does not look good.

3153
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:21,580
It's lifeline talking back.

3154
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:22,260
Oh, fuck.

3155
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,100
Yeah, I'm just going to be on that line over here.

3156
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,060
On the left side over here.

3157
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:26,580
Start setting up walls over here on me.

3158
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,380
I'm bang on taking that team to get pressure off of you.

3159
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:31,180
No.

3160
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:32,180
I got it.

3161
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:32,220
I got it.

3162
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:32,400
I'll rez.

3163
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:32,600
I'll rez.

3164
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:34,300
Or you rez.

3165
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:36,500
Pass one.

3166
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:36,720
Pass one.

3167
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:37,680
Nate.

3168
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:38,380
Nate.

3169
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:38,580
Nate.

3170
01:51:38,580 --> 01:51:38,700
Nate.

3171
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:39,200
Oh, my God.

3172
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:40,000
Get the reser again.

3173
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,400
Reser again.

3174
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:42,200
Fine.

3175
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:42,620
Fine.

3176
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:43,120
Fine.

3177
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:43,340
Fine.

3178
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:43,500
Fine.

3179
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,400
There's so many.

3180
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:46,100
There's so many.

3181
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:46,600
Woo.

3182
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:48,260
Nades.

3183
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:48,580
Nades.

3184
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:49,180
More nades.

3185
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:49,540
More nades.

3186
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:49,760
Dude.

3187
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,160
Yeah, that's a fuse team.

3188
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,220
More nades.

3189
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:55,200
Fuse.

3190
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,160
I just need my walls up.

3191
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:56,580
I'm begging.

3192
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:56,960
I need this.

3193
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:58,340
So many nades.

3194
01:51:58,540 --> 01:51:59,280
So many fuse.

3195
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:00,280
Start setting up walls.

3196
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:01,600
Oh, my God, dude.

3197
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:02,220
They're here.

3198
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:02,600
They're here.

3199
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:02,940
They're here.

3200
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:04,280
Yeah, that sucks.

3201
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:06,680
Oh.

3202
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:08,300
Oh, my God.

3203
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:11,980
You're the only one left.

3204
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:13,700
Just hide.

3205
01:52:24,770 --> 01:52:25,850
Did you hide?

3206
01:52:28,670 --> 01:52:30,010
Oh, my God, he's still alive.

3207
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:32,010
Oh, my God.

3208
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:34,850
Boy, were there so many nades.

3209
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:42,770
Why were there so many?

3210
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:44,710
You clutched your stress all day?

3211
01:52:45,070 --> 01:52:45,650
Yeah.

3212
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:49,700
Yeah.

3213
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,340
Oh my god!

3214
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:53,380
That would be crazy if you get this rez!

3215
01:52:54,180 --> 01:52:55,980
There's a vengel behind us, we can maybe 3p that.

3216
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:58,200
Oh my god, he's doing it!

3217
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:01,060
Where do we go?

3218
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:01,780
I don't see anything.

3219
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:02,860
I see smokes, but...

3220
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:04,040
I don't know if they're really fighting.

3221
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:07,860
I don't know, but we need to find a safe spot.

3222
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:08,960
Oh, I'm stuttering.

3223
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:12,000
I don't have walls.

3224
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,540
There's a shield right here, maybe we need to fight this.

3225
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:16,500
They're fighting, they're fighting!

3226
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:16,960
We need to commit this!

3227
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:17,660
Watch out!

3228
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:19,440
Behind us!

3229
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:19,600
Behind us!

3230
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:20,000
Behind us!

3231
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:20,920
Okay, I see that.

3232
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:22,980
I'm backing out.

3233
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:25,240
Come to me and put chill.

3234
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:28,460
The team is getting 3p'd.

3235
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:29,400
I'm lagging so bad.

3236
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,860
No, this is our servers.

3237
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,960
The whole team is running down to 3p it.

3238
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:33,620
I can't move.

3239
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,140
Holy fuck, the server is dying.

3240
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:38,120
The shield right here is set up walls.

3241
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,240
What the fuck, I can't move!

3242
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:46,600
One minute, thanks, Nerf War.

3243
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:47,820
Why is anybody shooting?

3244
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:48,480
Come on!

3245
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:51,600
They're fighting on the left.

3246
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:53,740
I'm gonna try to get involved.

3247
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:55,760
Full team dead, full team dead.

3248
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:56,600
Their second team is still alive.

3249
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:57,700
I'm backing up, I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

3250
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,240
Bro, I still see people in the fucking smoke.

3251
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,180
What the fuck is going on?

3252
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,340
The server is back to normal.

3253
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:10,360
Fucking 80 years later.

3254
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:12,700
I got red shields, I'm chilling.

3255
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:13,100
We're getting smoked.

3256
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,440
I don't see anything.

3257
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:17,680
I'm fucking legally blind.

3258
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:21,240
They're walking, they're walking, they're walking.

3259
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:22,460
I'm getting banned.

3260
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:23,780
Do you have Q?

3261
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:24,940
Yeah.

3262
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,120
I have no shields.

3263
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:31,100
I need some fucking loot.

3264
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:32,940
This team is moving, they're moving to that team.

3265
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:33,700
They're moving to this team.

3266
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,100
They're fighting, they're fighting this team to our right.

3267
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,060
They're fighting, they're pushing.

3268
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:39,800
Lifeline is late.

3269
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:42,840
Zed's gonna start closing, get the kills.

3270
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,040
Cracked, cracked, cracked, cracked.

3271
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,180
I don't know who I cracked though.

3272
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:51,680
Lifeline, you cracked Lifeline.

3273
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:55,780
Oh, I don't see them now.

3274
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:57,040
They're moving to us.

3275
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,080
Just hold them out.

3276
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:03,460
Close, close, close to the war.

3277
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:06,180
Close on this fucking face to the left.

3278
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:06,680
They're pushing, they're pushing.

3279
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:08,180
Flash one, flash one.

3280
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:11,320
I died, I died here.

3281
01:55:12,660 --> 01:55:12,980
Reloading.

3282
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:15,740
No, I'm being fucked.

3283
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:17,060
That's gonna kill me.

3284
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:19,420
She's behind you, she's in the ring.

3285
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:19,880
She's gonna die.

3286
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:21,200
What the fuck?

3287
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:24,940
There's a guy in the loot box.

3288
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,640
Behind you, full dead, full dead.

3289
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:30,800
I'm dead.

3290
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:33,120
A lot of people looking at me.

3291
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:33,880
Oh my god.

3292
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:38,800
Oh my god.

3293
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:42,600
One guy was hiding in the bin while I got bingled.

3294
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:48,200
These zone pulls are kinda crazy.

3295
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:49,400
This guy gets to chill?

3296
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,240
This team gets to just chill here?

3297
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:55,420
It's not fair.

3298
01:55:57,260 --> 01:55:59,040
I didn't even see the pathee.

3299
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:01,980
He was literally like...

3300
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,920
I got stunned by the bangle.

3301
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:05,060
And then like...

3302
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:08,060
I couldn't see him.

3303
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:08,860
It was like, blur.

3304
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:11,480
Oh my god.

3305
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:14,940
That was actually a crazy zone.

3306
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:19,860
Yeah, the bangle fucking stunned me so I couldn't see the...

3307
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:21,970
Yeah, he blended into...

3308
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:25,240
into the bin itself.

3309
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:27,200
Also, we were poor as hell.

3310
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,180
We were so poor.

3311
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,180
We had nothing.

3312
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:32,700
This is not fair.

3313
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,560
Did he get to just sit here?

3314
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:45,720
He gets to just sit here and not worry about the other team.

3315
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:46,840
He got to worry about the war outside?

3316
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,460
Oh yeah, I gotta fix my foogie in chat.

3317
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:53,240
Give me a sec.

3318
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:57,200
Just wanna remind you guys.

3319
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:00,100
And then...

3320
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,200
They should fix it.

3321
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:03,300
I'm pretty sure.

3322
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:04,900
They should start bouncing soon.

3323
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:06,800
And I'll fix my chat too.

3324
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:13,160
And then...

3325
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:14,800
There you go.

3326
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:15,360
You guys are fixed!

3327
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:16,300
Alright.

3328
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:17,760
But not that type of fix.

3329
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:18,680
Uh...

3330
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,180
Not like that.

3331
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:25,840
Not like that.

3332
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:29,040
You guys are back!

3333
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:33,480
Where is that?

3334
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:33,960
Where is that?

3335
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:37,920
Alright.

3336
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:39,140
I'll be right back.

3337
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:39,800
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3338
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:41,180
I'll be right back, guys.

3339
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:55,480
Alright, I'm back.

3340
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:55,780
Alright, I'm back.

3341
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:58,400
Does this mean dad hates almost all...

3342
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:58,600
No!

3343
01:58:58,740 --> 01:58:59,680
You guys can...

3344
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:01,420
You guys can fix him.

3345
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:02,120
You know?

3346
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,840
You know how you're like, I can fix her?

3347
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:05,520
You guys can be like, I can fix dad.

3348
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:12,320
You're like, I can fix him.

3349
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,460
I'll be the exception.

3350
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:20,700
Unless you're a lady goon.

3351
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:21,360
Then don't worry.

3352
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:22,440
You already got the free pass.

3353
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:24,180
Dad already loves you.

3354
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:31,900
You're your goal.

3355
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:33,160
We can't...

3356
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:36,540
At least, never last though.

3357
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:38,680
Now that I think about it...

3358
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:43,120
How the hell were we gonna get in a good rotation?

3359
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:45,180
We weren't.

3360
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:46,780
That was the funny part.

3361
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:47,800
Hahaha!

3362
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:47,880
Hahaha!

3363
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,080
It was just survive.

3364
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:55,000
Just survive.

3365
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:55,760
That's it.

3366
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:58,600
Which we didn't do very well.

3367
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,280
Hahaha!

3368
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,000
Damn.

3369
02:00:01,700 --> 02:00:03,560
I mean, that race was crazy though!

3370
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,260
We placed higher.

3371
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:08,180
We didn't get any money, but we placed higher.

3372
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:09,020
Hahaha!

3373
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:09,580
Hahaha!

3374
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,040
Oh my god, that poor team.

3375
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:17,780
Oh my god, that poor team.

3376
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:18,420
Jesus Christ.

3377
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,680
That poor team.

3378
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:21,680
Fucking high ground shit.

3379
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,860
This team has fucking high ground.

3380
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:24,660
Oh my god.

3381
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:28,160
That poor... poor fucking team.

3382
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:32,140
GG's a drop.

3383
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:36,990
Dropped what?

3384
02:00:37,410 --> 02:00:38,110
The fuck?

3385
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:42,310
How can he... Why can't he survive when he played with us?

3386
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:43,370
Hahaha!

3387
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:45,170
Hahaha!

3388
02:00:46,710 --> 02:00:49,730
He died first the last two games I had!

3389
02:00:49,730 --> 02:00:51,970
And he lives here!

3390
02:00:52,650 --> 02:00:53,290
Hahaha!

3391
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:55,190
Hahaha!

3392
02:00:55,710 --> 02:00:57,590
Drop couldn't do this earlier!

3393
02:00:58,490 --> 02:00:59,130
Hahaha!

3394
02:01:00,350 --> 02:01:00,990
Hahaha!

3395
02:01:01,310 --> 02:01:01,470
Hahaha!

3396
02:01:03,730 --> 02:01:06,070
It was my endgame!

3397
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:07,230
Dropped!

3398
02:01:07,310 --> 02:01:09,990
Where the fuck is my endgame?

3399
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:10,970
Hahaha!

3400
02:01:12,810 --> 02:01:14,090
Oh my god.

3401
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:15,990
GG's though.

3402
02:01:16,230 --> 02:01:16,870
GG's.

3403
02:01:16,890 --> 02:01:17,330
GG's?

3404
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:18,730
It was fun playing with you all.

3405
02:01:18,830 --> 02:01:18,990
Yeah.

3406
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:19,710
It was fun playing with you all.

3407
02:01:20,490 --> 02:01:21,050
GG's.

3408
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:21,590
GG's.

3409
02:01:21,690 --> 02:01:22,410
Nice meeting you guys.

3410
02:01:22,770 --> 02:01:23,150
Okay.

3411
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:25,690
On to the next team.

3412
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:27,290
Alright.

3413
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:31,010
Saucer gets to stay here because he's the fucking pro player.

3414
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:32,070
Alright.

3415
02:01:32,750 --> 02:01:33,830
Next team.

3416
02:01:35,130 --> 02:01:35,970
We have...

3417
02:01:36,510 --> 02:01:37,070
Yurise!

3418
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:37,850
Aprez!

3419
02:01:39,490 --> 02:01:40,410
Yujin and Doki.

3420
02:01:40,590 --> 02:01:41,030
That's me!

3421
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:41,630
I'm Doki!

3422
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:42,130
Hey!

3423
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:43,290
We played with Yurise before!

3424
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:46,070
We played with him before!

3425
02:01:46,530 --> 02:01:47,090
Okay.

3426
02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:49,050
Yurise is team 3.

3427
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:50,370
Alright.

3428
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:54,290
I'm just gonna shimmy over to here.

3429
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:56,690
How do I shimmy over here?

3430
02:01:57,850 --> 02:01:58,730
How do I shimmy over here?

3431
02:01:58,730 --> 02:02:00,150
How do I get over there?

3432
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:02,990
I don't know how to get over there.

3433
02:02:03,430 --> 02:02:06,590
How do you shimmy yourself to unassigned?

3434
02:02:06,970 --> 02:02:07,470
How do you shimmy yourself to unassigned?

3435
02:02:07,470 --> 02:02:07,850
Leave team!

3436
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:08,670
Oh my god.

3437
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:09,630
I figured it out guys.

3438
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:10,510
Okay.

3439
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:12,930
We need somebody on Yurise's team.

3440
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:14,830
Yeah!

3441
02:02:14,970 --> 02:02:16,610
We played with Aprez before.

3442
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:18,470
We talked about...

3443
02:02:19,730 --> 02:02:20,450
We talked about...

3444
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:22,550
We talked about MILF Island!

3445
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:24,190
I remember!

3446
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:25,330
Aprez!

3447
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:28,410
We talked about MILF MILF Manor?

3448
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:29,570
Was it MILF Manor?

3449
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:31,890
The one with the fucking moms!

3450
02:02:32,510 --> 02:02:33,550
Do you guys remember that?

3451
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:36,630
That conversation we had about that reality show?

3452
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:42,890
Where like all the moms and their like sons were trapped on an island.

3453
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:45,930
And the sons were dating each other's moms.

3454
02:02:46,490 --> 02:02:48,770
And like Aprez watched it.

3455
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:58,780
And he watched it.

3456
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,960
And then I was having a discussion with him about it.

3457
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,700
Because all I saw was the trailer.

3458
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:04,660
I didn't think someone was actually gonna watch it.

3459
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:06,060
And he watched it.

3460
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:09,980
So I was like Oh it's coming back to me now.

3461
02:03:10,060 --> 02:03:12,320
I remember MILF Island.

3462
02:03:16,660 --> 02:03:17,660
Oh yes.

3463
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:18,140
Yes.

3464
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:23,160
Yes it's a real reality TV show.

3465
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:29,900
Where like the moms like were you know with other their son.

3466
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:35,620
Oh my gosh it was I didn't realize somebody would actually do that show.

3467
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:44,080
That show was wild.

3468
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:47,420
That was a wild show that's for sure.

3469
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,920
It was definitely wild.

3470
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:55,660
Wait there's a season 2 of the dad?

3471
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:57,100
There's no way.

3472
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:58,340
Wait.

3473
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:00,180
I need to look it up now.

3474
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:01,200
I'll join a voice chat later.

3475
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:02,960
No.

3476
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:03,800
The season 2.

3477
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:04,500
MILF Matter.

3478
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:05,760
There's only like one.

3479
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:06,260
There's two.

3480
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:07,560
There is a season two.

3481
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,280
Wait is it actually?

3482
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:14,940
Barbie is a former stripper who currently works as a marketing executive.

3483
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:15,880
No.

3484
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:16,140
No.

3485
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:17,480
Season 2 is still moms.

3486
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:18,040
Guys.

3487
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:19,020
No it is!

3488
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:20,540
There's dads now!

3489
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:22,820
They added dads!

3490
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:26,080
Oh my god!

3491
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:28,480
They added Anthony!

3492
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:31,600
Son of Jo- They added dads?

3493
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:38,560
They added dads who brought their sons.

3494
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:39,940
Oh my god!

3495
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:43,140
They brought their sons!

3496
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:44,120
Okay.

3497
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:47,520
Can't believe they added dads.

3498
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:48,240
Okay.

3499
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:50,780
Change.

3500
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:51,800
You're good right?

3501
02:04:51,820 --> 02:04:52,500
It's about to change.

3502
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:54,840
I'm so freaking cooked this tourney bro.

3503
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:57,680
I got overstimulated the last two games.

3504
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:00,300
I like started like breaking down and shutting up.

3505
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:01,060
Oh shit.

3506
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:02,300
You're good.

3507
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:03,680
Hello.

3508
02:05:04,660 --> 02:05:05,180
Hello.

3509
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:06,600
Alright.

3510
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:10,600
Let's see.

3511
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:11,600
What's up Doki?

3512
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:12,380
Long time too!

3513
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:15,500
Now we're playing NA instead of GP!

3514
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:17,220
True.

3515
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:18,640
The tables have turned.

3516
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:21,140
Oh my god!

3517
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:21,480
Oh my god!

3518
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:21,700
Apriz!

3519
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:23,520
I've talked to you before!

3520
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:26,200
I don't know if you- Yeah fuck you.

3521
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:27,200
He's just ignoring you.

3522
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:28,240
Oh he's ignoring us?

3523
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:29,880
Bro what a bitch!

3524
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:30,840
I was asking if you were back!

3525
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:32,040
Oh did you?

3526
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:33,320
And you didn't even say back!

3527
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:34,920
You didn't even say back!

3528
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:39,440
Apriz do you remember the last conversation we had?

3529
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:41,800
The last time we got in a team together?

3530
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:43,820
Yeah.

3531
02:05:44,180 --> 02:05:45,740
You remember what we talked about?

3532
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:48,720
Cause I was telling my chat cause I remember what we talked about.

3533
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:52,120
Cause you watched Milk Manor right?

3534
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:53,620
Oh that's not me.

3535
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:59,640
Oh now you remember!

3536
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:01,920
Do you know they made a season 2?

3537
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:03,100
Yeah would you eat today Yuj?

3538
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:04,080
They had a dad!

3539
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:06,360
Yeah they had a dad!

3540
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,100
They're literally fucking dads!

3541
02:06:08,620 --> 02:06:09,600
They had a dad!

3542
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:11,560
Yo Yuj how you been today bro?

3543
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,720
So is it Milk Manor now?

3544
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:22,160
No no they added- so like instead of just moms and their sons they brought in dads and their sons.

3545
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:27,300
So the moms can pick either a dad or a son to bang.

3546
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:28,180
So...

3547
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,800
The whole family's there.

3548
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:32,480
Yeah the whole family's there.

3549
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:34,460
In the end they're all getting moms.

3550
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:35,420
In the end.

3551
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:36,660
Wow.

3552
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:37,120
Yeah.

3553
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:38,340
Yeah guys.

3554
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:39,160
Yeah.

3555
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:43,400
I totally know what you guys are talking about.

3556
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:46,640
I feel so fucking like...

3557
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:49,140
Yeah man the moms!

3558
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:52,620
It's basically an American reality TV show.

3559
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:57,160
Yeah yeah like American I'm out of that conversation.

3560
02:06:57,940 --> 02:07:00,820
What do you guys wanna play?

3561
02:07:01,460 --> 02:07:02,260
Um...

3562
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,900
Don't mind us just talking about it.

3563
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:07,040
Rampart is actually really good.

3564
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:11,000
So whoever can play Rampart shall take Rampart.

3565
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:12,460
Um...

3566
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:19,080
Rampart Bang Who do you play?

3567
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:20,700
Who are you comfortable with?

3568
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:23,200
Lifeline.

3569
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:24,360
Lifeline?

3570
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:26,300
Okay.

3571
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:27,340
Alright Lifeline.

3572
02:07:27,460 --> 02:07:28,520
Where were you joking?

3573
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:29,600
I don't know.

3574
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:31,720
What works in quads?

3575
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:34,660
In quads it's um...

3576
02:07:34,660 --> 02:07:39,940
What worked really well was Rampart and Bang.

3577
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:40,780
Alright.

3578
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:42,400
I'm curious what are you gonna play?

3579
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:46,240
I spaced out I'm gonna be completely honest.

3580
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:47,960
Okay we're not gonna win anything.

3581
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:48,840
No no no.

3582
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:52,100
If you need a Rampart like if we... If no one's playing Rampart I can play Rampart.

3583
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:53,400
Okay yeah you're a Rampart.

3584
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:56,140
And then... Well Yuris what are you playing then?

3585
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:57,140
Uh... I can play Bang.

3586
02:07:57,820 --> 02:07:58,960
Then what the fuck?

3587
02:07:58,980 --> 02:07:59,920
What's the fourth player?

3588
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:00,720
What am I?

3589
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:02,980
I'm thinking...

3590
02:08:02,980 --> 02:08:04,960
Then what's the third?

3591
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:10,500
We have either a beacon like a Path or a Blood or a Seer.

3592
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:15,180
I don't think I've seen anybody play Bloodhound during this entire...

3593
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:17,680
Hey we got third last time with the Blood.

3594
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:19,140
Oh we got third last time with Blood?

3595
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:20,940
Not first though.

3596
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:22,780
That's fucking...

3597
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:24,340
That's true.

3598
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:26,060
Okay yeah well I can do Blood.

3599
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:26,840
I'll do Blood.

3600
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:27,700
We'll see how it goes.

3601
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:29,860
What about Path?

3602
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:31,440
Wait what... Wait wait wait wait wait.

3603
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:35,200
What about Path and I... I play Path and you play Bang.

3604
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:36,120

3605
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:36,580
Okay.

3606
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:38,700
So we... Yes!

3607
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:41,600
No okay alright he's cooking he's cooking.

02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:43,020
We're cooking we're cooking.

3609
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:43,720
Yeah yeah yeah.

3610
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:45,880
Alright bring your...

3611
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:47,700
your berries down a little bit.

3612
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,080
Alright and then...

3613
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:51,040
We're doing Path...

3614
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:52,880
Bang...

3615
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:54,520
Rampart...

3616
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,200
and Lifeline.

3617
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:56,600
Yeah.

3618
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:58,140
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

3619
02:08:59,180 --> 02:09:04,080
Wait so what do you mean by over-simulated last two games?

3620
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:04,840
What happened last two games?

3621
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:05,120
Yeah what happened?

3622
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:11,320
Oh I mean they're just talking normally and like started getting really...

3623
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,480
I don't know.

3624
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:13,920
I don't know what went wrong.

3625
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:16,740
I just stopped thinking like and I stopped talking.

3626
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:18,660
Wait what team were you on?

3627
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:20,360
It was um...

3628
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:22,460
I mean no they're all like nice people.

3629
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:23,620
It was Zainu and...

3630
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:24,620
Nah nah nah nah.

3631
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:25,420
Who was it?

3632
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:26,460
Call him out!

3633
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:27,080
Who was it?

3634
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:30,060
It was literally Zainu, Entity, and RainyD.

3635
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:31,900
Oh it was Zainu of course.

3636
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:32,220
No of course.

3637
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:34,440
I don't know who he is but of course.

3638
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:36,780
Maybe he was... Judging from his name I expected.

3639
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:39,920
I know he's a roller player too so it makes sense.

3640
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:40,920
It makes sense yeah.

3641
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:42,260
And he's controller.

3642
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:45,140
Wait we're all M and K right?

3643
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:45,520
God.

3644
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:46,200
It's over.

3645
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:47,180
It's over.

3646
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:51,000
Maybe it was the testosterone.

3647
02:09:51,980 --> 02:09:52,700
It's over.

3648
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:54,300
It's over.

3649
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:54,680
It's so over.

3650
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:56,020
GG guys.

3651
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,180
I have a controller though.

3652
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:03,040
No you have a controller and there's a reason why you stuck with M and K after that.

3653
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:04,100
Oh shit.

3654
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:08,180
But didn't Reject win?

3655
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:08,900
Did he win?

3656
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:10,140
That is true!

3657
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:11,500
That is true!

3658
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,460
Did we win this?

3659
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:13,240
That is true.

3660
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:14,080
That is true.

3661
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:15,920
Are you saying a reject right now?

3662
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:17,840
Yeah we are.

3663
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,720
That is exactly what she's saying.

3664
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:21,940
That is exactly what she's saying.

3665
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:26,460
One of you guys is Sangjin and the other is...

3666
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,360
Wait who's the coach?

3667
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:30,160
Yeah who's the coach?

3668
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:31,280
We have no coach.

3669
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:33,660
It's over.

3670
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:35,520
We don't even have a coach.

3671
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:37,060
GG.

3672
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:39,020
Oh my god.

3673
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:39,780
It's so over.

3674
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:42,100
Guys...

3675
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:43,060
Wait what are we landing?

3676
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:44,160
Do we even have a spot?

3677
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:45,900
Yuris what are we landing?

3678
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:47,980
Yes yes Dragos Dragos Dragos.

3679
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:50,820
Don't worry.

3680
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:51,580
Don't worry.

3681
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:54,280
What if we get contested Yuris?

3682
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:56,480
Nah they won't contest us.

3683
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:57,980
They don't know that.

3684
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:59,120
They probably do.

3685
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:00,460
They probably know!

3686
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,480
Because they're like I didn't die in one second.

3687
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:04,240
They're M and K.

3688
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:09,460
They see you wall bounce and then like whiff and they're like oh M and K.

3689
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:10,400
Yeah true.

3690
02:11:10,420 --> 02:11:13,640
They see us walk and it's not in a straight line and it's gonna be like M and K.

3691
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:19,100
That guy's strafing.

3692
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:20,760
That is M and K.

3693
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:24,840
Oh my god.

3694
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:28,660
And if it somehow turns into World's Edge we have...

3695
02:11:29,660 --> 02:11:30,140
No.

3696
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:31,580
We have Broken Moon.

3697
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:32,380
We have...

3698
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:35,060
Well I heard they improved Broken Moon so...

3699
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:37,980
Yeah it's actually not bad.

3700
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:38,720
Yeah.

3701
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:42,560
It's better than fucking stuffing all of us in King's Canyon.

3702
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:45,820
That was scary.

3703
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:46,460
True.

3704
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:48,000
That was King's Canyon.

3705
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:50,540
There's too many people in King's Canyon.

3706
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:52,380
There's too many people in King's Canyon.

3707
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:54,980
Two more games!

3708
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:56,440
Two more games chat!

3709
02:11:56,940 --> 02:11:57,740
And then...

3710
02:11:57,740 --> 02:11:58,400
Dry Gulch.

3711
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:01,300
And then we... it's off to work.

3712
02:12:01,380 --> 02:12:02,500
I know where that is.

3713
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:03,200
I mean I'm still...

3714
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:06,900
Top left pretty much.

3715
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:07,440
Okay.

3716
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:07,920
Okay.

3717
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:08,280
Okay.

3718
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:11,660
And then if it's World's Edge...

3719
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:14,340
No we're doing Broken Moon.

3720
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:14,540
What?

3721
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:14,980
Happy server.

3722
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:19,400
Yeah if it... apparently it bugs to World's Edge sometimes.

3723
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:20,260
Oh!

3724
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:22,720
Oh are we playing through if it bugs to World's Edge?

3725
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:23,060
Yeah.

3726
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:23,640
Oh we are?

3727
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:24,080
Okay.

3728
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:26,300
Nice.

3729
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:27,320
I hope it does.

3730
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,340
World's Edge is better.

3731
02:12:31,180 --> 02:12:34,180
But we gotta get some of the other maps low.

3732
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:36,880
But we gotta get some of the other maps low.

3733
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:37,560
We talked about that.

3734
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:39,660
Look that was like my only thing...

3735
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:41,920
Cause like none of us...

3736
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:44,460
Cause like nobody watched Milt Manor except for you.

3737
02:12:44,740 --> 02:12:46,360
That's why I remembered it.

3738
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:50,720
Cause like we were just talking about the trailer and you're like I watched the entire season of Milt Manor.

3739
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:51,900
And then that like...

3740
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:53,880
That like left an impression on me.

3741
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,720
Wait Milt Manor?

3742
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:58,200
Yeah that's what it's called!

3743
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:00,660
Oh I thought it was Miss Hearing Shit.

3744
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:02,740
That was actually called Milt Manor.

3745
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,440
Yeah you can google it!

3746
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:05,280
Oh my god.

3747
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:06,740
It's fucking lit bro.

3748
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:08,880
It's fucking lit!

3749
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:10,540
Wait did you watch season 2?

3750
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:13,120
No I haven't even gotten that far.

3751
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:17,360
Was season 1 good enough to watch through the entire thing?

3752
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:18,660
It was good enough for him!

3753
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:22,740
Yeah but were you watching it more for the lols?

3754
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:23,840
It's just so dumb.

3755
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,420
It's just so dumb.

3756
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:29,580
There's like a guy in there that's just like fully chat.

3757
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:30,520
He's like what's up bro?

3758
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:35,660
Hot single moms dive into a unique dating experience.

3759
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:36,140
Hot single moms dive into a unique dating experience.

3760
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:36,860
Oh my god.

3761
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:38,820
And he watched the entire season!

3762
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:43,320
But aren't you also the guy who oh-wo-ifies everything?

3763
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:44,960
Wait what?

3764
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:46,420
Is that not you?

3765
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:47,900
No it's not me.

3766
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:50,280
I see your titles and it's like...

3767
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:51,620
Oh my god he's rewriting history.

3768
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:58,240
Okay so the thing is he's willing to own up to Milt Manor but he's not willing to own up to oh-wo.

3769
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:03,660
It's a command my mods made and they like uwu my titles.

3770
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:06,860
It's my mods!

3771
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:09,900
Blaming the mods.

3772
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:13,420
I heard the viewers reflect the streamers.

3773
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:14,240
Yeah that's true!

3774
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:15,480
That's true!

3775
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,660
You cultivate your chat!

3776
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:18,440
That's crazy.

3777
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:23,780
Your mods do it for free and you're blaming them?

3778
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,280
Your mods do it for free and you're blaming them?

3779
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:25,760
Oh god.

3780
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,560
Yeah look at that.

3781
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:31,060
I pay them in experience.

3782
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:33,640
I pay them in experience.

3783
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:33,840
Oh!

3784
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:38,520
You're gonna be their references.

3785
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:40,620
They're gonna call you up as a reference.

3786
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:41,400
Yeah.

3787
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:44,340
I'll give them a good review.

3788
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:45,500
I'll vouch.

3789
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:47,280
You'll vouch.

3790
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:53,360
People have actually used like moderators to apply for jobs I think.

3791
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:54,240
Oh shit.

3792
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,580
You guys hear that mods?

3793
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,480
You can use us as references.

3794
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:01,920
Cause it shows leadership qualities.

3795
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:02,760
No.

3796
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:04,840
I'll give you a bad reference.

3797
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:05,880
What the hell?

3798
02:15:07,120 --> 02:15:08,020
Oh god.

3799
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:10,160
She wants you to stay forever.

3800
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,820
Yeah I don't want you guys to leave so...

3801
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:15,020
You're not allowed to make money.

3802
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:15,500
Gatekeeping.

3803
02:15:15,740 --> 02:15:16,660
My mods.

3804
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:18,120
They're my mods.

3805
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:20,160
They're not gonna improve their jobs.

3806
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:21,340
Yeah.

3807
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:26,700
That is true.

3808
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:27,580
There is a lot of...

3809
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:28,880
There is a lot of um...

3810
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:31,660
management going on in the chat.

3811
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:33,480
It's a very chaotic place.

3812
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:34,700
Yeah.

3813
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:35,680
You could like exaggerate.

3814
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:37,520
How would you exaggerate like managing chat?

3815
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:38,360
Yeah.

3816
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,160
What would you put down there?

3817
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:43,040
Your boss is gonna be like What's a Twitch stream?

3818
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:45,480
Yeah.

3819
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:45,820
Um.

3820
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:51,640
I actually volunteer in a community of um...

3821
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:53,620
A lot of people.

3822
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,260
We're doing KC?

3823
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:55,660
No!

3824
02:15:56,180 --> 02:15:58,240
What about World's End?

3825
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:00,320
You lied to!

3826
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:01,480
No!

3827
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:02,460
No!

3828
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,660
What is your KC spot, Yuris?

3829
02:16:07,140 --> 02:16:07,660
Uh...

3830
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:09,440
We got runoff and bunker town.

3831
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:11,860
Oh.

3832
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:12,580
Okay.

3833
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:16,840
I turned down Yuris and turned up a praise aim word.

3834
02:16:16,940 --> 02:16:17,120
Oh wait.

3835
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:18,260
That's on your marriage.

3836
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:20,040
Oh thank you!

3837
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:21,360
You finally!

3838
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:23,680
I know you like proposed but...

3839

Yeah.

3842
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:26,880
Yeah.

3843
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:27,560
I got married.

3844
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:28,940
It was quite a long time ago.

3845
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:30,880
It's kinda like at the same time.

3846
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:33,080
Yeah but I never said anything.

3847
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:34,240
No.

3848
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:34,900
You're good.

3849
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:35,380
You're good.

3850
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:36,580
In like a call.

3851
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:38,160
So I just wanted to congratulate you.

3852
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:38,740
Yeah.

3853
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:39,860
Appreciate it.

3854
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:40,880
Thank you.

3855
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:41,640
Little love bird.

3856
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:44,980
You're like way younger than me and already married.

3857
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:46,320
That's not making any sense.

3858
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:47,200
Nah.

3859
02:16:47,480 --> 02:16:47,960
Nah.

3860
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:48,340
Nah.

3861
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:48,740
Nah.

3862
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:48,900
Nah.

3863
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:49,140
Damn.

3864
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:51,080
You gotta make it all about you.

3865
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:52,260
Yeah.

3866
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:54,200
I make everything about me.

3867
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:54,960
I'm sorry.

3868
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:59,100
Like the last time we played, I was like a little kid.

3869
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:00,020
That was crazy.

3870
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:00,240
Yeah.

3871
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:00,860
You were like 18.

3872
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:01,800
Yeah.

3873
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:03,640
Damn.

3874
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:06,580
I don't even remember how young I was because it didn't matter.

3875
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:07,540
You were just a baby.

3876
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:09,040
Oh my god.

3877
02:17:09,060 --> 02:17:10,180
You had all the rank days.

3878
02:17:10,580 --> 02:17:10,980
Yeah.

3879
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:14,420
I know he got engaged.

3880
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:15,220
I didn't know.

3881
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:15,860
Yeah.

3882
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:19,500
I didn't know he got... I didn't know like finalized married married.

3883
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:20,540
What's going on here?

3884
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:21,280
Yeah.

3885
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:22,060
What is going on here?

3886
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:22,840
I don't know.

3887
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:23,420
I have...

3888
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:25,800
No clue.

3889
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:27,020
It's bugged.

3890
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:27,440
Please.

3891
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:28,800
We still have two more games.

3892
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:34,420
This has more delays than scrims, please.

3893
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:34,820
Yeah.

3894
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:36,060
We got two games to win.

3895
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:39,360
Have any of you guys won your game yet?

3896
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:40,300
Hell no.

3897
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:40,960
Nah.

3898
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:44,680
Listen... I used... Have any of you guys got last place?

3899
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:45,920
No.

3900
02:17:46,220 --> 02:17:47,380
I got last place.

3901
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:50,620
I got 20th first place.

3902
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:54,000
Listen, I watched the VOD.

3903
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:55,820
That was entirely Greek's fault.

3904
02:17:56,120 --> 02:18:00,280
That was entirely Greek's fault.

3905
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:01,680
Was it really Greek spot?

3906
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:03,960
It was really Greek spot.

3907
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:06,220
I need to watch that spot.

3908
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:06,800
No!

3909
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:09,400
I'm getting a new lobby!

3910
02:18:11,580 --> 02:18:14,120
Let me pick my character so I don't fucking...

3911
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:14,660
Oh, true.

3912
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:17,060
Lean custom match.

3913
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:20,040
Well, I kind of thought like...

3914
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:22,260
in a retrospect that I also like...

3915
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:24,120
you know, I landed like right side.

3916
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:26,520
I was like looting for a little bit too long.

3917
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:28,960
And then I like waddle up as Caustic.

3918
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:30,880
And then I start shooting a Prowler.

3919
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,700
But I didn't realize that I was gonna shoot my Prowler...

3920
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:34,460
instead of my RE45.

3921
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:36,060
So my aim goes really skewpy.

3922
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:39,100
Yeah, so then I was like...

3923
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:40,120
Oh gosh.

3924
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:41,540
It's me.

3925
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:42,660
It's my fault.

3926
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:44,300
No.

3927
02:18:44,380 --> 02:18:45,200
Oh, Nuko's out.

3928
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:48,380
Alright.

3929
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:49,640
Damn.

3930
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:51,380
Greek knew what he was shooting.

3931
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:52,700
I'm getting like a scoop.

3932
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:55,280
They're saying Greek did 19 damage?

3933
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:56,320
Damn!

3934
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:58,500
Greek did 19 damage?

3935
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:00,520
Just snitching on us.

3936
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:02,280
Just snitching on us dumbass bruh.

3937
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:03,080
Damn!

3938
02:19:04,560 --> 02:19:06,420
Just snitching on us dumbass bruh.

3939
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:09,080
Yeah, to be fair...

3940
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:11,640
that game I did 54 damage.

3941
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:13,120
Yeah, yeah.

3942
02:19:13,140 --> 02:19:15,000
As long as you're not the lowest...

3943
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,060
that's all that matters.

3944
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:17,540
I was better than him.

3945
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:18,200
He used to be pro.

3946
02:19:18,680 --> 02:19:20,220
Yeah, he used to be a pro player.

3947
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:21,100
That's why he's a character.

3948
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:24,300
As I turn down your ACS.

3949
02:19:30,220 --> 02:19:31,120
Oh my N.

3950
02:19:31,420 --> 02:19:31,800
Sorry.

3951
02:19:31,980 --> 02:19:33,240
I believe in this team.

3952
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:36,980
As long as we get a house, we can sit all the way to 6th place.

3953
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:37,940
And do nothing.

3954
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:38,980
That's all we need.

3955
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:40,560
6th place?

3956
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:43,120
We're gonna aim for higher.

3957
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:44,160
Look.

3958
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:48,580
I didn't even get to at least 6th place.

3959
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:49,800
I need that 6th place.

3960
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:51,200
I got one 6th.

3961
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:54,000
Our top rating was 7th.

3962
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:58,720
I think my top rating was like 8th or 9th.

3963
02:19:58,720 --> 02:19:58,940
I think my top rating was like 8th or 9th.

3964
02:19:58,960 --> 02:19:59,380
I don't know.

3965
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:02,440
Oh my N.

3966
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:04,180
But I killed a person.

3967
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:05,060
Okay.

3968
02:20:05,420 --> 02:20:10,080
We have Yurise who plays a lot of rank and a lot of scrims.

3969
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:11,260
So you guys should know end zone.

3970
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:13,500
You guys should know where the house is.

3971
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:15,100
The ideal house.

3972
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:19,200
I have not touched comp in about...

3973
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,320
We both haven't.

3974
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:24,040
We both haven't touched comp in a long time.

3975
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,420
We both haven't.

3976
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:26,440
We both haven't.

3977
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:28,380
You know what the rank end zone is.

3978
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:29,640
That's all that matters.

3979
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:32,920
Can we bring a coach in, Nicole?

3980
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:33,860
Yeah, can we?

3981
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:36,020
Can we bring a coach in?

3982
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:38,500
Can I like FaceTime Wig and just show him this?

3983
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:39,640
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3984
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:41,380
Call Wig right now.

3985
02:20:41,380 --> 02:20:42,180
Yes, do it.

3986
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:44,180
Do it.

3987
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:45,000
Call him right now.

3988
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,120
Get your phone down and call him.

3989
02:20:46,180 --> 02:20:46,840
Put him on the mic.

3990
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:47,800
What?

3991
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:49,100
Do it.

3992
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:51,640
He won't be able to hear you though.

3993
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:52,340
It's fine.

3994
02:20:53,880 --> 02:20:57,440
If you want to relay the mess, call him right now.

3995
02:20:57,660 --> 02:20:58,360
If you want to relay the mess, call him right now.

3996
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:02,760
Alright, let's see if he answers.

3997
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:05,480
If he doesn't answer, he's not a real friend.

3998
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:06,760
He's pretty fake.

3999
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:07,200
Oh god.

4000
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:14,680
If he doesn't answer your call, I'll call him and see if he answers mine.

4001
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:16,540
I'm really fucked up.

4002
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:19,420
Because I have his phone number too.

4003
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:21,100
He's not going to answer.

4004
02:21:21,260 --> 02:21:22,000
Oh my god.

4005
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:24,980
He's not.

4006
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:25,640
He's not.

4007
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:27,220
This fake fuck.

4008
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:29,460
He actually doesn't answer you.

4009
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:31,180
Oh my god.

4010
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:32,460
You try.

4011
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:32,980
You try.

4012
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:34,500
Nah, nah.

4013
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:35,100
You do it.

4014
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:37,100
If he answers, that's crazy.

4015
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:40,080
That's crazy if he answers.

4016
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:40,940
Oh my god.

4017
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:41,380
Wait, okay.

4018
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:43,020
I'm going to call.

4019
02:21:43,300 --> 02:21:44,460
I'm going to call and see.

4020
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:46,520
Okay, guys.

4021
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:50,680
Okay, let's see.

4022
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:53,340
I need to find his number.

4023
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:54,360
Oh, he's calling me.

4024
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:56,040
Oh, oh.

4025
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:56,920
Hello?

4026
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:00,760
Yeah, we don't know zones.

4027
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:05,120
Can I FaceTime you and just show you the zone?

4028
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:08,720
Doki?

4029
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:17,380
Doki was asking us that we better know zone.

4030
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:18,340
But we don't know shit.

4031
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:19,840
We need a coach.

4032
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:21,280
Yeah, we need a coach.

4033
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:21,960
Coach us.

4034
02:22:22,900 --> 02:22:24,220
Yeah, I got Doki Bird.

4035
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:25,880
Oh, gosh.

4036
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:29,320
Oh, shit.

4037
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,660
He did 14 damage?

4038
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:33,000
Oh, shit.

4039
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:34,280
Oh, damn.

4040
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:35,400
That's fucked up.

4041
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:39,980
That's a lie.

4042
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:40,360
That's a lie.

4043
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:42,840
He said Tempo would do better than me.

4044
02:22:43,240 --> 02:22:44,060
That's a lie.

4045
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:45,220
Just say it straight up.

4046
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:50,300
Okay, but it's not because of me.

4047
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:50,700
It's not me.

4048
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:51,120
Love you.

4049
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:55,420
By the way, do you think my toilet is still a great toilet?

4050
02:22:55,640 --> 02:22:56,880
It's still stained for your Panda Express.

4051
02:22:58,700 --> 02:23:00,040
I didn't stain it.

4052
02:23:00,620 --> 02:23:01,840
I'm supposed to be.

4053
02:23:02,420 --> 02:23:04,560
What is happening right now?

4054
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:05,260
Nah, bro.

4055
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:06,220
That's all him, not me.

4056
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:08,600
Alright, yeah, bye-bye.

4057
02:23:10,060 --> 02:23:12,200
He didn't even say love you.

4058
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:13,000
He did.

4059
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:13,940
Oh, he did?

4060
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:14,840
Okay, I was gonna say it.

4061
02:23:14,840 --> 02:23:16,780
I'd be fucked up if he didn't say it back.

4062
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:18,560
He said I stained Greek's toilet.

4063
02:23:19,180 --> 02:23:19,900
Did you?

4064
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:21,260
I don't think so.

4065
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:23,440
Oh my god, that is not a no.

4066
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:24,800
That is not a no.

4067
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:26,920
That's not a no.

4068
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:29,320
I mean, I might have.

4069
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:33,380
What the fuck did you eat?

4070
02:23:33,460 --> 02:23:35,560
Because I ate Panda Express from the airport.

4071
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:36,840
Oh my god.

4072
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:37,720
At the airport?

4073
02:23:38,180 --> 02:23:39,400
Yeah, I was hungry.

4074
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:42,700
Oh my god, you probably pay Greek.

4075
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:46,860
I gotta pay to use this toilet?

4076
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:48,280
Yeah, that one.

4077
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:49,120
It's like a toll.

4078
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:50,500
That's crazy.

4079
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:53,760
That's crazy that Wiggs said that though.

4080
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:55,370
He said, he instantly said his GG's.

4081
02:23:56,060 --> 02:23:56,600
Yeah.

4082
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:59,400
In every game you did 14 damage.

4083
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:01,330
That is not true.

4084
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:02,300
No trust.

4085
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:07,140
Now I was watching the Challenger Circuit.

4086
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:08,580
They did well.

4087
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:10,280
Yeah, we did so well.

4088
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:11,620
You guys went to day two.

4089
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:13,000
Yeah, we went.

4090
02:24:13,340 --> 02:24:15,880
Yeah, you almost got to day three.

4091
02:24:16,220 --> 02:24:18,380
Yeah, we almost made it to the finals.

4092
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:19,100
Yeah, we almost made it to the finals.

4093
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:23,240
Wigg was supposed to sign us up for the next Challenger Circuit, but he forgot.

4094
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:26,580
Of course he didn't.

4095
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:27,000
Of course he didn't.

4096
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:30,020
So yeah, I've...

4097
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:31,380
What is going on?

4098
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:32,280
What's taking so long?

4099
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:33,700
Are we not there yet?

4100
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:35,180
I think the servers are broken or something.

4101
02:24:35,380 --> 02:24:37,300
Have you guys been lagging by the way?

4102
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,520
Yeah, no, the servers are fucked.

4103
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:44,480
Mine is said we were on Dallas, but uh...

4104
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:48,060
Yeah, I have like the lowest ping of like 90.

4105
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:49,100
Yeah, I have like the lowest ping of like 90.

4106
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:52,020
It like fucks up in the middle of the game too.

4107
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:52,620
That's the thing.

4108
02:24:54,460 --> 02:24:55,880
Like everybody's ping just...

4109
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:58,140
Yeah, packet loss and ping in the middle of fights.

4110
02:24:58,200 --> 02:24:58,880
Which was crazy.

4111
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:01,860
Uh...

4112
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:06,600
Yeah, someone told me I won Clip Timmy, and then I was like, oh, but was it like...

4113
02:25:07,060 --> 02:25:10,080
Did I like only win because of ping spike?

4114
02:25:10,300 --> 02:25:13,060
And then I had to look back on the bot.

4115
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:16,620
So was it because of ping or was it pure skill?

4116
02:25:17,140 --> 02:25:17,800
Oh, no!

4117
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:19,100
Oh, there he goes.

4118
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:21,160
Damn, you should play one.

4119
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:22,660
That's your moment.

4120
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:24,020
That's your moment right there.

4121
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,020
He bleeds.

4122
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:27,660
Yeah, I mean I was...

4123
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:29,180
He's not a perfect being.

4124
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:39,460
But honestly, it was about time I got revenge because he shits on me every fucking turn or like content creator like match or whatever.

4125
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:43,220
I just get bullied and beat around and that was my one...

4126
02:25:43,220 --> 02:25:44,840
My one vengeance.

4127
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:47,180
That's why you gotta put yourself as...

4128
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:49,400
Like when they sign up, it'd be like, what's your highest rank?

4129
02:25:49,460 --> 02:25:53,380
Yeah, I'll put like plat or something so you get to be... have like the lowest expectations.

4130
02:25:57,440 --> 02:26:03,740
Yeah, but most of the times I already feel like I am the weakest link in most lobbies.

4131
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:05,240
It's okay, I'm here now.

4132
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:06,700
No, no, no.

4133
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:07,840
Literally!

4134
02:26:10,940 --> 02:26:15,460
Didn't you... didn't you recently get like top 500 in Overwatch?

4135
02:26:15,580 --> 02:26:16,940
No, that wasn't...

4136
02:26:16,940 --> 02:26:19,460
That wasn't like season one in Overwatch 2.

4137
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:20,800
There's...

4138
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:23,200
It's season 10 in Overwatch 2 now!

4139
02:26:23,780 --> 02:26:25,780
You can do it again!

4140
02:26:26,300 --> 02:26:28,880
You're like a FPS like god.

4141
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:31,540
Bro, the last time I played Apex was two weeks ago!

4142
02:26:32,220 --> 02:26:33,400
Oh god damn.

4143
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:35,140
Oh god.

4144
02:26:36,420 --> 02:26:37,900
We might be cooked.

4145
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:41,940
Should we just teabag if we see a team and then they'll let us go?

4146
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:42,800
No, they're just gonna shoot us.

4147
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:44,520
These guys really want that $700.

4148
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:46,100
Yeah, they have this money involved.

4149
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:46,640
Yeah.

4150
02:26:47,020 --> 02:26:48,280
There's money involved.

4151
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:51,860
I literally made more via super chats on my YouTube stream than I...

4152
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:53,220
Damn!

4153
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:54,340
Damn!

4154
02:26:56,370 --> 02:26:57,900
You said you broke box?

4155
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:00,140
No!

4156
02:27:00,260 --> 02:27:06,440
I'm saying, even if I win zero prize money...

4157
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:07,040
That's crazy!

4158
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,740
If I win zero prize money here...

4159
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:10,540
Shit!

4160
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:13,660
My Dragoons got me.

4161
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:16,060
So it feels like I'm winning.

4162
02:27:16,780 --> 02:27:17,640
Oh, I see.

4163
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:20,460
They're donating prize money to me.

4164
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:21,660
Oh, okay.

4165
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:24,520
Participation is a reward, you know?

4166
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:25,000
Yeah.

4167
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:33,840
Okay, so like I told my chat this, but Tempo is actually holding at least 10k worth of prize money for me because I forgot to fill in the tax form.

4168
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:35,900
Jesus.

4169
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:37,860
Oh my god.

4170
02:27:38,180 --> 02:27:44,460
Because I participated in so many of Tempo's tournaments, so like I never filled the tax form.

4171
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:46,420
To receive it.

4172
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:46,680
Oh!

4173
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:48,560
You got a game!

4174
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:51,800
Let's freaking go.

4175
02:27:52,060 --> 02:27:53,120
Let's go, let's go.

4176
02:27:55,460 --> 02:27:57,040
You guys know who you're playing, right?

4177
02:27:57,220 --> 02:27:58,200
Yeah, Bangalore.

4178
02:27:58,920 --> 02:27:59,480
Yeah.

4179
02:28:00,460 --> 02:28:01,540
I'm Rampart.

4180
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:03,600
Yeah, you're on Rampart duty.

4181
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:06,420
Yeah, I got it.

4182
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:07,340
You guys got me, right?

4183
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:10,000
Even if I don't win prize money.

4184
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:11,900
You guys got me, right?

4185
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:16,720
Yeah, I think it was from like End of Seasons event last season.

4186
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:19,940
Because we can't keep giving more money to Tempo's bank account.

4187
02:28:19,940 --> 02:28:20,400
Yeah.

4188
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,080
It's me.

4189
02:28:23,380 --> 02:28:24,440
A spendy.

4190
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:25,420
A whale.

4191
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:26,760
Damn.

4192
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:35,720
We don't look very intimidating.

4193
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:37,720
Don't say that.

4194
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:39,500
What do you mean?

4195
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:41,000
All our skins.

4196
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,900
They don't look scary at all.

4197
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:45,180
I have a pink skin.

4198
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:46,440
That's so scary.

4199
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:48,420
Faker does not use skin.

4200
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:50,840
Yeah, but he has a $500 skin.

4201
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:52,740
Where's our $500 skin?

4202
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:54,760
Wait, I don't want to beat your master.

4203
02:28:54,860 --> 02:28:55,980
I don't know where we're going.

4204
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:57,200
Oh!

4205
02:28:58,920 --> 02:28:59,400
Oh!

4206
02:29:02,200 --> 02:29:03,160
What happened?

4207
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:08,800
What bugged out?

4208
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:10,960
What happened, bro?

4209
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:12,080
Yes.

4210
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:13,340
I've been watching for 20 years.

4211
02:29:13,660 --> 02:29:14,900
Oh my god.

4212
02:29:17,740 --> 02:29:19,260
It's been so long.

4213
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:22,960
I'm screaming.

4214
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:26,560
Oh my god.

4215
02:29:26,980 --> 02:29:27,700
Why?

4216
02:29:27,940 --> 02:29:29,400
Why didn't we start?

4217
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:32,660
I had bacon.

4218
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:39,120
Question mark.

4219
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:51,620
I can't believe we don't even have a coach to tell us where endgame is.

4220
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:53,040
Thank you Bin.

4221
02:29:53,220 --> 02:29:54,540
Thank you guys for getting me.

4222
02:29:54,820 --> 02:29:57,900
Even if we don't get any prize money.

4223
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:02,060
Wait, who crashed?

4224
02:30:02,220 --> 02:30:02,760
Somebody crashed.

4225
02:30:02,980 --> 02:30:08,360
Someone on Drop's team crashed, but now Kimmy's team is spamming their 4th.

4226
02:30:08,380 --> 02:30:09,380
Because I think they're AFK.

4227
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:11,760
She's back.

4228
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:12,900
Oh, okay.

4229
02:30:14,260 --> 02:30:16,360
Wait, more than one person crashed.

4230
02:30:17,940 --> 02:30:18,540
Jesus.

4231
02:30:19,380 --> 02:30:20,280
Oh no.

4232
02:30:20,580 --> 02:30:21,180
Yes!

4233
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:21,900
Finally!

4234
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:23,820
Oh my god.

4235
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:26,220
You're finally here.

4236
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:27,900
I already have red bars.

4237
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:29,080
Yeah.

4238
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:30,340
No, I'm good.

4239
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:31,780
My PC's okay.

4240
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:36,740
Oh my god, we're finally here.

4241
02:30:37,220 --> 02:30:38,040
It's okay.

4242
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:40,100
We bonded as a team.

4243
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:42,940
Guys, see?

4244
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:45,080
I knew I could get back into the groove, guys.

4245
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:46,620
I told you.

4246
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:47,560
It just took a while.

4247
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:49,560
Also, feel free to yell at me for anything.

4248
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:51,480
Don't yell at me though.

4249
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:02,860
Like, I'm trying my best, but I might be a bit slow.

4250
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:04,960
Oh my god.

4251
02:31:04,980 --> 02:31:06,320
Oh my god.

4252
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:09,300
Bro, love yourself.

4253
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:10,160
It is true.

4254
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:11,800
Love yourself.

4255
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:14,120
Oh, okay.

4256
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:14,880
I'll try.

4257
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:17,700
You gotta try to love yourself.

4258
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:18,140
Bro!

4259
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:21,560
Bro, you're gonna rip more than Ernie.

4260
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:23,320
I wasn't feeling the best.

4261
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:25,060
Oh my god.

4262
02:31:25,100 --> 02:31:26,680
And now I'm feeling a lot worse.

4263
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,060
What hurt you?

4264
02:31:29,060 --> 02:31:30,380
Uh, you know...

4265
02:31:31,180 --> 02:31:33,340
I don't think we should trauma dumb.

4266
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:36,660
We should lock her up.

4267
02:31:38,320 --> 02:31:39,200
Oh my god.

4268
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:44,360
I think we have a space port too.

4269
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:45,700
Yeah, I was gonna ask that.

4270
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:46,400
Okay.

4271
02:31:47,180 --> 02:31:49,480
He's just letting me for real.

4272
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:50,200
For real.

4273
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:51,720
Oh my god.

4274
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:52,640
I think we have it.

4275
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:53,600
Okay.

4276
02:31:53,620 --> 02:31:53,760
Oh yeah.

4277
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:55,600
Maybe.

4278
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,360
I can't do anything, right?

4279
02:31:57,400 --> 02:31:57,900
So I just land?

4280
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:58,740
I don't got no bins?

4281
02:31:59,020 --> 02:31:59,460
No.

4282
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:00,540
Yeah, where do I land?

4283
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:02,580
I'm landing here.

4284
02:32:02,980 --> 02:32:03,400
Yeah?

4285
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:05,620
Oh wait.

4286
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:06,100
Yeah.

4287
02:32:06,100 --> 02:32:07,560
I think you got it.

4288
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:08,120
It's Doki.

4289
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:08,680
Nevermind.

4290
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:08,920
Yeah.

4291
02:32:08,980 --> 02:32:10,060
Doki, you land in this side.

4292
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:10,540
Alright.

4293
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:12,900
You and I, you just land in that side.

4294
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:13,120
Okay.

4295
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:14,100
I got you guys.

4296
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:16,580
Alright.

4297
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:17,100
Here we go.

4298
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:19,980
It all began when I was born.

4299
02:32:22,060 --> 02:32:22,460
Okay.

4300
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:24,580
There's an evac tower here.

4301
02:32:25,820 --> 02:32:26,220
Nice.

4302
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:27,040
We need those.

4303
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:27,800
We need those.

4304
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,120
Okay.

4305
02:32:31,660 --> 02:32:33,420
Try to think of what guns to put.

4306
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:34,560
Ooh.

4307
02:32:36,100 --> 02:32:44,000
We need a long... I mean we have... we have a rampage, but I'd rather not use a rampage.

4308
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:48,020
Okay.

4309
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:52,260
Give me actually... oh there we go.

4310
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:53,000
Nice.

4311
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:53,320
Okay.

4312
02:32:53,320 --> 02:32:53,640
Vault.

4313
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:55,300
Carbine.

4314
02:32:55,580 --> 02:32:56,060
Nice.

4315
02:32:56,220 --> 02:32:56,900
We're good.

4316
02:32:57,560 --> 02:32:58,460
We're cooking.

4317
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:02,080
Another evac tower?

4318
02:33:03,220 --> 02:33:03,860
Nice.

4319
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:04,380
Nice.

4320
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:06,260
We have cheese.

4321
02:33:06,260 --> 02:33:06,780
Oh, Havoc?

4322
02:33:07,540 --> 02:33:08,620
Versatile energy weapon.

4323
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:10,740
Any cheesers?

4324
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:11,340
Oh.

4325
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:14,280
Cheese to me, Evo.

4326
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:14,760
Cheese?

4327
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:16,060
Cheese what?

4328
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:17,080
Harvester.

4329
02:33:17,300 --> 02:33:18,140
Evo Harvester.

4330
02:33:18,140 --> 02:33:19,400
Oh, any Harvester?

4331
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:19,760
Oh.

4332
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:22,880
I don't think I've ever heard somebody call it that.

4333
02:33:23,060 --> 02:33:24,020
Like, the fuck?

4334
02:33:24,340 --> 02:33:24,740
Wait.

4335
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:26,860
What the heck?

4336
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:28,440
I swear that's how they call it.

4337
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:31,700
I'm dropping a bit of energy and a blue mag here.

4338
02:33:35,560 --> 02:33:36,400
No, just call it Evo.

4339
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:36,860
Oh, I thought you were talking about the horses, Ron.

4340
02:33:37,700 --> 02:33:38,500
Aren't you a source?

4341
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:39,820
Maybe... do they call that in Japanese?

4342
02:33:40,460 --> 02:33:40,980
Nah.

4343
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:42,340
What do they call it in Japanese?

4344
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:43,340
In NA?

4345
02:33:43,620 --> 02:33:44,560
In NA?

4346
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:46,160
They actually do say Evo.

4347
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:46,860
Oh, Evo.

4348
02:33:46,940 --> 02:33:47,080
Yeah.

4349
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:51,700
Maybe I got my sources from Japan, too.

4350
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:52,300
Yeah.

4351
02:33:52,520 --> 02:33:53,040
True.

4352
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:53,420
True.

4353
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:55,800
We don't have any?

4354
02:33:55,940 --> 02:33:56,420
That is...

4355
02:33:58,620 --> 02:33:59,140
Sad.

4356
02:34:02,140 --> 02:34:04,860
They're asking us to play on hard mode.

4357
02:34:04,860 --> 02:34:05,900
Hard mode?

4358
02:34:05,960 --> 02:34:06,620
What's hard mode?

4359
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:08,600
You know...

4360
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:10,460
No Evo...

4361
02:34:10,460 --> 02:34:11,680
M&K...

4362
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:11,880
Oh!

4363
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:13,060
True.

4364
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:13,560
True.

4365
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:14,060
True.

4366
02:34:14,900 --> 02:34:15,960
We need every help.

4367
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:16,120
We need more money.

4368
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:18,860
Temple hates one of us.

4369
02:34:18,900 --> 02:34:19,640
Or all of us.

4370
02:34:19,660 --> 02:34:21,260
And that's why she put all of us on the team together.

4371
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:26,360
Where's the other one?

4372
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:32,240
Can you open one of those bins?

4373
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:33,520
I'll be able to scan the...

4374
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:34,260
Yeah.

4375
02:34:34,460 --> 02:34:35,720
I'm heading over there now.

4376
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:37,220
Okay.

4377
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:37,940
Oh!

4378
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:41,620
We don't even have a zone beacon.

4379
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:42,740
Evac tower here.

4380
02:34:42,980 --> 02:34:45,140
They're not even trying to hide it.

4381
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:46,640
Oh my God.

4382
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:48,180
Why don't we grab that 3x?

4383
02:34:48,320 --> 02:34:48,600
Oh!

4384
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:49,580
What the fuck?

4385
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:50,680
Oh you want me to?

4386
02:34:50,700 --> 02:34:51,160
Who was there?

4387
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:51,820
Who was there?

4388
02:34:53,380 --> 02:34:54,720
I don't know if they're close.

4389
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:55,880
I'm just trying to heal.

4390
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:57,560
I'm heading over to your East right now.

4391
02:34:57,860 --> 02:34:58,540
I left.

4392
02:34:59,960 --> 02:35:01,100
He's dead if he stays.

4393
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:05,080
Alright.

4394
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:07,420
Do we somehow have a zone that we don't know about?

4395
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:07,920
Jesus.

4396
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:09,300
Not even in core?

4397
02:35:09,540 --> 02:35:09,740
Okay.

4398
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:11,180
Someone call Wig again.

4399
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:12,300
Someone...

4400
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:14,500
We need him.

4401
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:16,880
I'm out of here.

4402
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:17,260
Careful.

4403
02:35:17,420 --> 02:35:18,340
Oh my God.

4404
02:35:19,260 --> 02:35:20,700
Where did you get shot?

4405
02:35:20,940 --> 02:35:21,380
Yeah.

4406
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:22,180
Go towards...

4407
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:22,960
Go towards the...

4408
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:23,480
Hold on.

4409
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:24,120
I have to heal.

4410
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:24,620
Yeah.

4411
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:25,100
I'll watch for you.

4412
02:35:25,140 --> 02:35:25,540
I'll watch for you.

4413
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:32,520
Oh my God.

4414
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:33,120
We're white armor.

4415
02:35:33,220 --> 02:35:33,580
Please.

4416
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:35,240
Be gentle.

4417
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:37,720
Shots in core.

4418
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:39,840
So we're going for the cheese?

4419
02:35:40,520 --> 02:35:40,920
Yes.

4420
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:41,520
The Eva.

4421
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:42,220
The left side?

4422
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:43,500
I'll go take it alone.

4423
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:44,640
Start looking into core.

4424
02:35:45,020 --> 02:35:46,100
Maybe set up this building.

4425
02:35:46,820 --> 02:35:47,160
Okay.

4426
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:48,920
There's an extra bat in here.

4427
02:35:49,740 --> 02:35:50,320
I'm chilling.

4428
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:50,900
I have four.

4429
02:35:51,060 --> 02:35:51,500
I'm gonna take it.

4430
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:52,520
Yeah.

4431
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:54,300
I think he needs it the most.

4432
02:35:54,460 --> 02:35:55,020
I have...

4433
02:35:55,020 --> 02:35:55,780
I just used a lot.

4434
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:57,660
I have one.

4435
02:35:57,800 --> 02:35:58,860
Are they still chasing you?

4436
02:35:59,040 --> 02:35:59,360
I can drop...

4437
02:35:59,360 --> 02:35:59,600
Nah.

4438
02:35:59,700 --> 02:36:00,440
They're not chasing.

4439
02:36:00,660 --> 02:36:00,940
They're not chasing.

4440
02:36:01,400 --> 02:36:01,800
Oh.

4441
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:02,920
We are chilling.

4442
02:36:03,360 --> 02:36:04,060
You want me?

4443
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,320
I think we have the zone close somehow.

4444
02:36:07,320 --> 02:36:07,700
Do you want me to heal?

4445
02:36:07,700 --> 02:36:09,080
Do you want to be a tactical or alt cooldown?

4446
02:36:10,780 --> 02:36:11,100
Tactical.

4447
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:12,080
All right.

4448
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:13,320
It depends.

4449
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:16,240
I always ask for Bing because it depends on the pro player.

4450
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:18,600
Put down my ulti for some men.

4451
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:18,720
Wait.

4452
02:36:18,780 --> 02:36:18,900
Right here.

4453
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:19,060
Close.

4454
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:19,760
Oh.

4455
02:36:19,940 --> 02:36:20,260
Close.

4456
02:36:20,400 --> 02:36:21,180
What the fuck?

4457
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:22,000
Wait.

4458
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:22,480
Let's fight this.

4459
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:22,720
Fight this.

4460
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:22,960
Fight this.

4461
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:24,120
On me.

4462
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:24,300
On me.

4463
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:26,100
He's on the roof, I think.

4464
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:26,680
He's right here.

4465
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:27,120
On the shallow roof.

4466
02:36:27,960 --> 02:36:28,760
I heard someone close.

4467
02:36:28,900 --> 02:36:28,960
Oh.

4468
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:29,780
There's one on you?

4469
02:36:29,820 --> 02:36:29,960
What?

4470
02:36:30,220 --> 02:36:30,540
Yeah.

4471
02:36:31,320 --> 02:36:31,640
Yeah.

4472
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:31,780
Right here.

4473
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:34,080
It's a rampart.

4474
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:34,540
It's a rampart.

4475
02:36:35,740 --> 02:36:36,060
Wait.

4476
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:36,660
I can't.

4477
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:37,680
The angles are just too much.

4478
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:39,200
Yeah.

4479
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:39,460
Yeah.

4480
02:36:39,460 --> 02:36:40,220
I could.

4481
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:41,260
And I got shot in the side.

4482
02:36:41,900 --> 02:36:42,220
63.

4483
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:42,760
Oh.

4484
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:43,520
Nice shot.

4485
02:36:44,600 --> 02:36:44,920
Wait.

4486
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:45,360
Do we have to zip?

4487
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:46,440
I think we have the zone.

4488
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:47,320
Wait.

4489
02:36:47,380 --> 02:36:47,840
They zipped over.

4490
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:48,340
Oh.

4491
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:48,520
Wait.

4492
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:48,840
Right side.

4493
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:49,280
Right side.

4494
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:49,520
He fell down.

4495
02:36:50,420 --> 02:36:51,060
There's one right here.

4496
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:51,340
I see that.

4497
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:51,640
I see that.

4498
02:36:51,980 --> 02:36:52,300
Wait.

4499
02:36:52,380 --> 02:36:52,620
I see that.

4500
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:52,840
I see that.

4501
02:36:52,860 --> 02:36:53,040
I see that.

4502
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:53,820
A whole team.

4503
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:54,960
Yeah.

4504
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:55,600
Yeah.

4505
02:36:55,640 --> 02:36:57,140
They're playing the zip.

4506
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:57,920
They're running it.

4507
02:36:59,440 --> 02:37:00,080
They're valking.

4508
02:37:01,160 --> 02:37:02,160
There's so many people.

4509
02:37:02,860 --> 02:37:04,120
They're going to valk all this team.

4510
02:37:04,120 --> 02:37:04,260
Yeah.

4511
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:04,520
They should.

4512
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:04,800
They should.

4513
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:05,080
This.

4514
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:05,300
Okay.

4515
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:08,780
I'm going to valk.

4516
02:37:08,780 --> 02:37:08,860
I'm going to valk.

4517
02:37:08,860 --> 02:37:09,240
Okay.

4518
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:09,740
Idiot.

4519
02:37:15,370 --> 02:37:16,250
No flash.

4520
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:16,750
Aw.

4521
02:37:16,930 --> 02:37:17,370
Yeah.

4522
02:37:17,390 --> 02:37:20,870
I think the zone is somehow going fucking where we came from.

4523
02:37:20,890 --> 02:37:21,570
I think it was on us.

4524
02:37:21,870 --> 02:37:22,310
Yeah.

4525
02:37:22,830 --> 02:37:23,630
I'm pretty sure.

4526
02:37:24,170 --> 02:37:24,930
That sucks.

4527
02:37:24,970 --> 02:37:25,170
That sucks.

4528
02:37:25,170 --> 02:37:26,050
I got through this tunnel.

4529
02:37:26,650 --> 02:37:28,110
And we can control this height right here.

4530
02:37:28,110 --> 02:37:29,530
We could have stayed in the house.

4531
02:37:29,950 --> 02:37:30,950
We could have.

4532
02:37:31,210 --> 02:37:32,910
We could have stayed in the house.

4533
02:37:35,950 --> 02:37:37,870
People literally gave us a house.

4534
02:37:38,070 --> 02:37:38,270
All right.

4535
02:37:39,230 --> 02:37:40,110
It happens.

4536
02:37:40,470 --> 02:37:42,130
I have a fortnite.

4537
02:37:42,150 --> 02:37:42,170
I'm going to get a fortnite.

4538
02:37:42,170 --> 02:37:43,330
You have any more bats, if anyone needs?

4539
02:37:43,530 --> 02:37:44,370
Yeah, I need one.

4540
02:37:44,990 --> 02:37:45,310
OK.

4541
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:50,110
Pretty sure there's...

4542
02:37:50,110 --> 02:37:50,350
Yeah.

4543
02:37:50,410 --> 02:37:51,150
There's spots here.

4544
02:37:51,810 --> 02:37:52,130
Yeah.

4545
02:37:52,170 --> 02:37:53,410
There's some good spots to our left.

4546
02:37:53,530 --> 02:37:55,330
There's, like, a really deep rock you can play in.

4547
02:37:57,370 --> 02:37:57,690
Yeah.

4548
02:37:57,750 --> 02:37:58,010
All right.

4549
02:37:58,010 --> 02:37:58,890
We just play here for now.

4550
02:37:59,510 --> 02:37:59,830
Okay.

4551
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:00,370
Okay.

4552
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:01,870
Wait.

4553
02:38:01,930 --> 02:38:02,390
There's a wall.

4554
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:03,950
Is that our lifeline pack or is that someone else?

4555
02:38:04,610 --> 02:38:04,930
No.

4556
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:05,390
There's a team here.

4557
02:38:05,490 --> 02:38:05,630
There's a team here.

4558
02:38:05,630 --> 02:38:05,650
No, no.

4559
02:38:05,690 --> 02:38:06,450
There's someone else.

4560
02:38:06,630 --> 02:38:07,190
We did not...

4561
02:38:07,190 --> 02:38:08,410
We can go up here, Urisse.

4562
02:38:08,410 --> 02:38:09,130
It's, like, a good spot.

4563
02:38:09,670 --> 02:38:10,170
Up here?

4564
02:38:10,550 --> 02:38:10,870
Oh.

4565
02:38:12,170 --> 02:38:13,210
What the heck?

4566
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:15,150
Oh, what is this zone?

4567
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:17,670
Wait, yeah, we definitely...

4568
02:38:17,670 --> 02:38:18,630
We can go like right here.

4569
02:38:19,050 --> 02:38:22,150
Yo, this is... we're vibing.

4570
02:38:22,430 --> 02:38:22,710
Yeah.

4571
02:38:25,110 --> 02:38:26,530
Not that far left.

4572
02:38:26,670 --> 02:38:28,650
Yeah, we're not vibing that far.

4573
02:38:29,070 --> 02:38:29,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4574
02:38:31,110 --> 02:38:33,290
They could peek this right here though.

4575
02:38:33,330 --> 02:38:33,850
That kind of sucks.

4576
02:38:34,250 --> 02:38:35,530
There's a team in bridge.

4577
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:38,830
You can even go more up here.

4578
02:38:38,970 --> 02:38:39,710
Oh, apartment.

4579
02:38:39,710 --> 02:38:40,790
What the f...

4580
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:43,670
Okay, we gotta make presence here though.

4581
02:38:43,830 --> 02:38:44,390
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4582
02:38:45,870 --> 02:38:48,770
People might just roll up here because we're hiding there.

4583
02:38:48,770 --> 02:38:49,990
I'm gonna put this wall to our left.

4584
02:38:50,010 --> 02:38:50,130
Okay, out the left.

4585
02:38:50,310 --> 02:38:54,730
Oh my god, we can put four walls?

4586
02:38:54,870 --> 02:38:55,810
How many walls can I put up?

4587
02:38:55,970 --> 02:38:56,370
Five.

4588
02:38:56,450 --> 02:38:59,970
Looks like people are here.

4589
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:04,320
I knocked one.

4590
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:06,600
Oh, damn, Thurston!

4591
02:39:08,180 --> 02:39:09,540
Wait, we might be able to get to Thurston.

4592
02:39:09,540 --> 02:39:09,980
He's right here.

4593
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:11,980
Oh, he's like deep in that.

4594
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:15,380
Yeah, the most I can do is just hit their Watson Gen.

4595
02:39:15,740 --> 02:39:16,180
Yeah.

4596
02:39:16,620 --> 02:39:17,280
All good.

4597
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:19,060
Okay.

4598
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:22,560
I really should know that Watson Gen who's boss.

4599
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:23,420
Damn.

4600
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:26,540
Make them waste their ulti cells.

4601
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:32,380
Alright, I'm gonna chill.

4602
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:34,020
I have 140 heavy.

4603
02:39:34,660 --> 02:39:36,160
Oh, I can drop you some up.

4604
02:39:36,820 --> 02:39:37,260
254.

4605
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:39,120
Dude, it was in our building.

4606
02:39:39,220 --> 02:39:39,900
I'm so sad.

4607
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:42,600
It really was.

4608
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:44,960
This is the second time I've gotten zoned with no zone knowledge.

4609
02:39:45,100 --> 02:39:45,640
It's so annoying.

4610
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:47,960
Unlucky.

4611
02:39:47,960 --> 02:39:48,960
Actually cursed.

4612
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:54,720
I mean, I feel like that was a sign when we had team literally Mach 7 you over there.

4613
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:55,800
True.

4614
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:59,420
It is kind of hard to hold like over there though.

4615
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:00,000
That's true.

4616
02:40:00,180 --> 02:40:02,180
We could take like a second floor but...

4617
02:40:02,180 --> 02:40:08,120
Yeah, I feel like Cat would have been better if we wanted to hold like a room over there.

4618
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:09,000
Yeah.

4619
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:11,100
But it's okay.

4620
02:40:11,460 --> 02:40:12,860
Maybe zone will flip on us.

4621
02:40:13,700 --> 02:40:14,900
We'll see the zone.

4622
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:16,700
Yeah, maybe we'll be lucky.

4623
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:20,820
Yeah, we can't be that unlucky, right?

4624
02:40:21,380 --> 02:40:21,820
Yeah.

4625
02:40:22,140 --> 02:40:25,320
The 4M and K team.

4626
02:40:26,840 --> 02:40:27,280
Yeah.

4627
02:40:27,380 --> 02:40:28,220
With no beacons.

4628
02:40:28,520 --> 02:40:28,960
What?

4629
02:40:29,100 --> 02:40:30,200
How did I break my wall?

4630
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:32,540
Did you break your own wall?

4631
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:36,860
There's a guy right here that I can barely see.

4632
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:37,940
I feel like we need a new wall.

4633
02:40:38,120 --> 02:40:38,440
Come on.

4634
02:40:42,060 --> 02:40:43,820
The guy right here is really...

4635
02:40:43,820 --> 02:40:44,340
Got a minute.

4636
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:47,980
Can we somehow evac...

4637
02:40:47,980 --> 02:40:49,620
Okay, we're not evacing from there.

4638
02:40:50,660 --> 02:40:52,700
Okay, we can evac from here.

4639
02:40:56,180 --> 02:40:57,760
Alright, moment of truth.

4640
02:40:59,040 --> 02:40:59,540
Yeah.

4641
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:00,440
Never mind in a minute.

4642
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:03,100
I thought I did rest when we were in the slow side.

4643
02:41:09,980 --> 02:41:10,480
Oh.

4644
02:41:10,580 --> 02:41:10,960
Oh.

4645
02:41:16,710 --> 02:41:18,730
It would be so funny if I had a shot there.

4646
02:41:20,070 --> 02:41:20,710
Warming.

4647
02:41:22,050 --> 02:41:23,830
M and K noob.

4648
02:41:24,750 --> 02:41:26,290
Are you like...

4649
02:41:26,290 --> 02:41:28,590
Oh, that guy's red armor.

4650
02:41:28,910 --> 02:41:30,350
The team on the... what?

4651
02:41:30,650 --> 02:41:32,470
The team has red.

4652
02:41:33,070 --> 02:41:34,170
That's kinda crazy.

4653
02:41:35,550 --> 02:41:37,090
Bro, where did he get red?

4654
02:41:37,470 --> 02:41:38,370
Is this hell?

4655
02:41:41,310 --> 02:41:42,310
You're a rat.

4656
02:41:42,430 --> 02:41:44,530
Oh no, it started.

4657
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:46,270
Not the fuse.

4658
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:47,870
Oh no.

4659
02:41:48,010 --> 02:41:49,850
The only thing that can hurt us.

4660
02:41:50,130 --> 02:41:50,650
Nades.

4661
02:41:50,870 --> 02:41:53,090
I'm bad.

4662
02:41:55,670 --> 02:41:55,930
Ten seconds.

4663
02:41:55,930 --> 02:41:57,970
If we have to do anything...

4664
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:03,540
These guys are just.

4665
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:04,180
Standing still.

4666
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:07,500
Wait, that safe?

4667
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:07,980
What?

4668
02:42:08,460 --> 02:42:10,560
Oh, shit!

4669
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:14,060
Oh, we're still trying to be.

4670
02:42:14,140 --> 02:42:15,320
Oh, wait, this is not right.

4671
02:42:16,220 --> 02:42:18,100
I don't know if there's still someone here.

4672
02:42:18,440 --> 02:42:19,260
You can put the second guy in.

4673
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:21,140
There's like walls over here on the low ground.

4674
02:42:22,120 --> 02:42:23,380
Should be able to play that.

4675
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:30,880
Because this bridge team can't really peek towards us like once we're on this low ground.

4676
02:42:31,080 --> 02:42:31,220
Yeah.

4677
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:34,300
106.

4678
02:42:35,740 --> 02:42:36,180
Dead.

4679
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:37,140
I killed one here.

4680
02:42:37,400 --> 02:42:37,960
Oh nice.

4681
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:39,640
Thirsty or just not?

4682
02:42:39,660 --> 02:42:40,780
Yeah, we can't really rest now.

4683
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:43,800
Oh, I'm just gonna stay with you.

4684
02:42:43,880 --> 02:42:44,420
Yeah, that guy's just...

4685
02:42:47,740 --> 02:42:49,880
I'm wasting my shield cells just healing.

4686
02:42:50,020 --> 02:42:52,020
On this next zone close, we're just gonna play the low ground.

4687
02:42:53,560 --> 02:42:56,660
We gotta wait for Preez's walls.

4688
02:42:57,140 --> 02:42:58,160
Why we have walls?

4689
02:42:58,600 --> 02:43:02,400
We can probably play the like the low ground of the bridge too later like over here.

4690
02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:05,560
Should I place my package for mid?

4691
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:08,720
Uh, yeah, yeah, I don't think we're gonna get hurt.

4692
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:09,360
Should I place it low ground?

4693
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:11,000
Yeah, place it like right here.

4694
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:14,840
Team VOD voting.

4695
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:17,080
Where they're going.

4696
02:43:17,480 --> 02:43:17,860
All right.

4697
02:43:17,940 --> 02:43:18,860
What is that spot?

4698
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:23,240
Ah, I gotta get it for you.

4699
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:25,440
Whoa, don't shoot me.

4700
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:26,140
What do you need?

4701
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:27,340
We're just vibing.

4702
02:43:27,820 --> 02:43:28,900
We have more shields.

4703
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:30,860
In bats?

4704
02:43:30,980 --> 02:43:36,000
Well, I got three bats but five cells but I'm spamming my sentinel.

4705
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:36,740
Thank you.

4706
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:37,900
I'm just vibing.

4707
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:43,600
Team here.

4708
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:45,220
There's a whole team here.

4709
02:43:45,740 --> 02:43:46,220
Yeah.

4710
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:47,800
Uh, team here.

4711
02:43:49,860 --> 02:43:51,680
Oh, I'm scared.

4712
02:43:53,320 --> 02:43:55,040
Should we start setting up?

4713
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:55,660
Yeah.

4714
02:43:55,880 --> 02:43:56,480
Yeah, my fault.

4715
02:43:57,900 --> 02:43:58,720
All right.

4716
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:02,080
Oh, I like this.

4717
02:44:02,080 --> 02:44:02,780
I like this pack.

4718
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:03,780
This is scary.

4719
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:04,280
Yeah.

4720
02:44:05,900 --> 02:44:07,940
Yeah, there's still a team this way.

4721
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:10,940
That team should get pinched like this team playing this.

4722
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,800
I think they're just playing the building and then that platform over there.

4723
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:14,360
Okay.

4724
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:16,760
We can even play the low ground of this later too.

4725
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:17,480
All right.

4726
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:17,660
Yeah.

4727
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:21,000
Team playing this.

4728
02:44:26,630 --> 02:44:27,870
I don't see anybody.

4729
02:44:29,130 --> 02:44:30,470
They're all just very far.

4730
02:44:32,370 --> 02:44:32,770
Oh.

4731
02:44:33,030 --> 02:44:34,890
Yeah, I think we're gonna play the low ground of this bridge.

4732
02:44:34,890 --> 02:44:35,670
That was our house.

4733
02:44:35,750 --> 02:44:36,610
What the fuck?

4734
02:44:36,890 --> 02:44:37,290
Oh.

4735
02:44:37,850 --> 02:44:38,790
That was scary.

4736
02:44:38,790 --> 02:44:39,390
I can drone.

4737
02:44:39,770 --> 02:44:40,370
Oh, no.

4738
02:44:41,570 --> 02:44:42,230
All right.

4739
02:44:42,230 --> 02:44:42,550
Fine.

4740
02:44:44,690 --> 02:44:46,650
Why are they not shooting that team in the bridge?

4741
02:44:46,830 --> 02:44:47,090
Hello?

4742
02:44:47,870 --> 02:44:49,430
Maybe they have a secret alliance.

4743
02:44:49,450 --> 02:44:50,610
That guy shot me at the gap.

4744
02:44:50,910 --> 02:44:52,070
I was like not expecting that.

4745
02:44:52,090 --> 02:44:52,730
Wait, he just...

4746
02:44:52,730 --> 02:44:53,130
Oh.

4747
02:44:53,130 --> 02:44:53,830
What the...

4748
02:44:53,830 --> 02:44:54,330
88.

4749
02:44:55,590 --> 02:44:56,390
Let's see if I can...

4750
02:44:56,390 --> 02:44:57,050
Try coming down and...

4751
02:44:57,050 --> 02:44:57,750
Yeah.

4752
02:44:57,770 --> 02:44:58,230
Oh, no.

4753
02:44:58,410 --> 02:44:58,750
Hopping.

4754
02:45:00,550 --> 02:45:01,470
I have the bat.

4755
02:45:01,610 --> 02:45:02,530
Putting drone on you too.

4756
02:45:02,810 --> 02:45:03,170
Yeah.

4757
02:45:03,250 --> 02:45:04,070
I can't see.

4758
02:45:04,150 --> 02:45:04,870
I just caught...

4759
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:05,550
I can't see either.

4760
02:45:06,850 --> 02:45:07,550
Nade, nade, nade.

4761
02:45:07,790 --> 02:45:07,850
You're nading, nading.

4762
02:45:07,850 --> 02:45:08,130
Yeah.

4763
02:45:08,590 --> 02:45:09,470
We're good, we're good, we're good.

4764
02:45:09,510 --> 02:45:09,710
We're here.

4765
02:45:09,770 --> 02:45:10,470
Oh, I'm not good.

4766
02:45:10,530 --> 02:45:11,050
I am...

4767
02:45:11,630 --> 02:45:12,530
We're gonna just go in there.

4768
02:45:12,570 --> 02:45:12,850
We're gonna...

4769
02:45:12,850 --> 02:45:13,730
Oh, I'm dead again.

4770
02:45:15,010 --> 02:45:16,310
I was trying to shoot them.

4771
02:45:16,310 --> 02:45:16,750
No audio.

4772
02:45:16,950 --> 02:45:17,350
Nice.

4773
02:45:17,530 --> 02:45:18,530
That was cool.

4774
02:45:19,690 --> 02:45:20,750
Oh, no.

4775
02:45:21,530 --> 02:45:22,610
I win these.

4776
02:45:23,910 --> 02:45:24,510
Yep.

4777
02:45:24,690 --> 02:45:25,930
That was cool.

4778
02:45:26,330 --> 02:45:28,310
I didn't think they were gonna push us.

4779
02:45:28,690 --> 02:45:30,650
That was really fucking cool.

4780
02:45:31,070 --> 02:45:32,410
Actually, no audio.

4781
02:45:32,690 --> 02:45:33,470
Holy shit.

4782
02:45:33,510 --> 02:45:34,350
Where did he come from?

4783
02:45:36,070 --> 02:45:36,670
Yep.

4784
02:45:37,030 --> 02:45:37,630
No way.

4785
02:45:38,810 --> 02:45:39,870
Oh, my God.

4786
02:45:40,190 --> 02:45:40,790
Wait.

4787
02:45:40,790 --> 02:45:43,630
What the fuck was the Watson team on the left platform?

4788
02:45:43,770 --> 02:45:44,190
Hello?

4789
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:47,170
What?

4790
02:45:47,470 --> 02:45:48,030
I don't know.

4791
02:45:48,170 --> 02:45:49,130
I guess we just left.

4792
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:51,270
I didn't know it was one team.

4793
02:45:51,710 --> 02:45:52,190
I guess so.

4794
02:45:52,190 --> 02:45:52,490
I didn't either.

4795
02:45:53,670 --> 02:45:55,150
We would have just played like...

4796
02:45:55,150 --> 02:45:55,310
Yeah.

4797
02:45:55,650 --> 02:45:56,930
We could have moved out so much.

4798
02:45:57,370 --> 02:45:57,730
Yeah.

4799
02:45:57,950 --> 02:45:59,450
I don't know where that team on the left went.

4800
02:45:59,530 --> 02:45:59,650
Yeah.

4801
02:45:59,650 --> 02:46:00,670
I was so surprised.

4802
02:46:00,770 --> 02:46:01,510
It came out of nowhere.

4803
02:46:01,890 --> 02:46:02,290
It was a different team.

4804
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:03,210
And I never heard that.

4805
02:46:03,210 --> 02:46:03,270
It was.

4806
02:46:03,570 --> 02:46:03,930
100%.

4807
02:46:04,310 --> 02:46:04,670
Nope.

4808
02:46:04,730 --> 02:46:05,390
They didn't fight.

4809
02:46:06,850 --> 02:46:07,210
What?

4810
02:46:07,430 --> 02:46:08,390
Yeah, we have another game.

4811
02:46:08,390 --> 02:46:08,910
We have another game.

4812
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:10,210
Just no audio.

4813
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:10,990
Yeah, that was just...

4814
02:46:10,990 --> 02:46:11,970
That's not on us.

4815
02:46:11,990 --> 02:46:13,090
That's not MNK.

4816
02:46:13,150 --> 02:46:13,930
That's on audio.

4817
02:46:14,350 --> 02:46:15,370
That was crazy.

4818
02:46:15,770 --> 02:46:16,130
I...

4819
02:46:16,130 --> 02:46:16,290
I...

4820
02:46:16,290 --> 02:46:17,650
I actually have never...

4821
02:46:17,650 --> 02:46:18,390
I was...

4822
02:46:20,530 --> 02:46:20,970
Guys.

4823
02:46:21,330 --> 02:46:22,790
At least not last, guys.

4824
02:46:23,070 --> 02:46:24,650
At least not last.

4825
02:46:24,850 --> 02:46:25,290
True.

4826
02:46:25,750 --> 02:46:26,190
True.

4827
02:46:26,270 --> 02:46:26,710
True.

4828
02:46:26,930 --> 02:46:27,710
No, they had the freeze rotate.

4829
02:46:27,910 --> 02:46:28,970
What the fuck?

4830
02:46:31,110 --> 02:46:32,990
I don't know where everyone went on this side.

4831
02:46:33,210 --> 02:46:34,410
Yeah, I don't know.

4832
02:46:34,410 --> 02:46:36,110
I don't know where they went.

4833
02:46:36,210 --> 02:46:36,670
Straight up.

4834
02:46:37,090 --> 02:46:38,090
I hope they die.

4835
02:46:38,390 --> 02:46:40,090
That could have been our house right there.

4836
02:46:40,410 --> 02:46:40,510
Yes.

4837
02:46:40,510 --> 02:46:41,330
I hope they die.

4838
02:46:41,510 --> 02:46:41,910
Me too.

4839
02:46:41,970 --> 02:46:43,770
I hope they die seventh.

4840
02:46:46,290 --> 02:46:47,030
So they never think...

4841
02:46:47,030 --> 02:46:47,290
Oh, peek down.

4842
02:46:47,450 --> 02:46:48,370
Yes, peek down.

4843
02:46:48,570 --> 02:46:49,910
No, why are you not peeking down?

4844
02:46:50,190 --> 02:46:50,750
Die seventh.

4845
02:46:50,850 --> 02:46:51,310
Die seventh.

4846
02:46:51,310 --> 02:46:51,770
Come on.

4847
02:46:51,810 --> 02:46:52,330
Yes.

4848
02:46:52,330 --> 02:46:53,090
Kill them.

4849
02:46:53,150 --> 02:46:53,650
Come on.

4850
02:46:54,910 --> 02:46:58,010
Make it seem like they're gonna get placement money.

4851
02:47:02,710 --> 02:47:03,230
Apex...

4852
02:47:03,230 --> 02:47:04,130
Oh my god.

4853
02:47:04,130 --> 02:47:05,830
Where did that team on the left go?

4854
02:47:06,550 --> 02:47:07,070
What?

4855
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:13,790
Not only did we not get our house, we got audioed so hard.

4856
02:47:13,970 --> 02:47:14,310
Yeah.

4857
02:47:14,350 --> 02:47:16,690
And everybody rotated away.

4858
02:47:16,930 --> 02:47:17,450
Yeah.

4859
02:47:17,790 --> 02:47:18,310
Yeah.

4860
02:47:18,310 --> 02:47:18,750
Ugh.

4861
02:47:19,930 --> 02:47:21,330
What the fuck.

4862
02:47:21,650 --> 02:47:23,210
They get such a free run.

4863
02:47:27,170 --> 02:47:27,690
Okay.

4864
02:47:27,770 --> 02:47:31,370
But maybe we just get all our bad luck out of the way.

4865
02:47:31,870 --> 02:47:32,930
And get a win.

4866
02:47:32,990 --> 02:47:33,430
Yeah.

4867
02:47:33,690 --> 02:47:36,310
And then next game, we have a comeback.

4868
02:47:37,390 --> 02:47:39,510
That's why I think I agree with that.

4869
02:47:39,650 --> 02:47:43,410
When you say that, you sound so depressed as if you don't believe.

4870
02:47:47,010 --> 02:47:49,610
It's hard to like, believe in that plan.

4871
02:47:53,170 --> 02:47:55,270
That's just my state of being.

4872
02:47:55,710 --> 02:47:56,910
Oh my god!

4873
02:47:58,570 --> 02:48:00,970
Is this why you play... you still play?

4874
02:48:01,850 --> 02:48:02,470
Yeah.

4875
02:48:04,170 --> 02:48:06,690
That's why I've been taking a break from Apex Legends.

4876
02:48:07,550 --> 02:48:08,170
Shit!

4877
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:12,730
Yesterday was like my first time in a couple weeks playing.

4878
02:48:13,130 --> 02:48:13,890
Oh shit.

4879
02:48:15,810 --> 02:48:16,970
That's too real.

4880
02:48:17,230 --> 02:48:18,470
That's too real, man.

4881
02:48:22,170 --> 02:48:24,050
Oh my god, they might die seventh!

4882
02:48:25,090 --> 02:48:26,490
That's all I wanted!

4883
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:26,670
Yes!

4884
02:48:27,230 --> 02:48:28,770
The lifeline of death!

4885
02:48:29,170 --> 02:48:29,890
No!

4886
02:48:31,950 --> 02:48:33,390
Die seventh!

4887
02:48:33,910 --> 02:48:34,270
No!

4888
02:48:34,370 --> 02:48:35,090
No!

4889
02:48:37,310 --> 02:48:39,350
They got seventh!

4890
02:48:40,430 --> 02:48:41,050
No!

4891
02:48:41,450 --> 02:48:42,750
They got seventh.

4892
02:48:43,290 --> 02:48:44,430
What is happening?

4893
02:48:45,770 --> 02:48:48,790
Why are they giving such free res's?

4894
02:48:48,790 --> 02:48:50,430
Res's are 10 times.

4895
02:48:50,690 --> 02:48:54,070
This lifeline is actually carrying the frick out of them.

4896
02:48:54,130 --> 02:48:54,430
Yeah!

4897
02:48:54,910 --> 02:48:55,430
No!

4898
02:48:55,550 --> 02:48:57,550
Wait, that lifeline just went crazy.

4899
02:48:57,790 --> 02:48:59,010
Yeah, their lifeline clutched it.

4900
02:48:59,010 --> 02:48:59,530
Yeah, gold knock.

4901
02:48:59,930 --> 02:49:01,410
Just tapping repeatedly.

4902
02:49:01,970 --> 02:49:03,350
Where's our gold knock?

4903
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:05,550
Where the fuck is it?

4904
02:49:05,550 --> 02:49:07,950
Okay, I was 958 evo off.

4905
02:49:08,090 --> 02:49:08,630
I'm sorry.

4906
02:49:10,130 --> 02:49:12,370
No, we actually got fucked hard.

4907
02:49:12,610 --> 02:49:13,490
I'm not gonna lie.

4908
02:49:13,570 --> 02:49:13,890
Oh my god.

4909
02:49:13,990 --> 02:49:15,750
We had the zone, we had no beacon.

4910
02:49:15,910 --> 02:49:16,470
No beacon.

4911
02:49:16,690 --> 02:49:16,990
Like...

4912
02:49:16,990 --> 02:49:17,810
No!

4913
02:49:17,950 --> 02:49:18,730
We got no audio.

4914
02:49:19,010 --> 02:49:20,510
They can't place my money.

4915
02:49:20,690 --> 02:49:20,970
No!

4916
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:26,500
It's okay.

4917
02:49:26,700 --> 02:49:27,480
These nades.

4918
02:49:27,580 --> 02:49:28,780
These nades might be it.

4919
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,340
Somebody please throw more nades into them.

4920
02:49:32,560 --> 02:49:33,360
What is that team?

4921
02:49:33,560 --> 02:49:33,640
Take them out!

4922
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:35,380
What is that team doing, bro?

4923
02:49:35,480 --> 02:49:36,400
Just kill this team.

4924
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:37,100
Kill the lifeline!

4925
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:38,760
How is the lifeline not dying?

4926
02:49:39,140 --> 02:49:39,300
Just kill!

4927
02:49:39,300 --> 02:49:39,300
Yeah!

4928
02:49:40,820 --> 02:49:42,120
She's doing her job.

4929
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:43,480
She's playing back.

4930
02:49:44,020 --> 02:49:44,820
Wait, how?

4931
02:49:46,660 --> 02:49:49,160
Somebody please fire the lifeline.

4932
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:50,920
That lifeline is actually going crazy.

4933
02:49:51,080 --> 02:49:53,760
Yeah, they're actually getting saved by the lifeline.

4934
02:49:57,250 --> 02:49:58,810
I can't believe it.

4935
02:49:58,830 --> 02:50:01,150
This team is the main character.

4936
02:50:03,250 --> 02:50:05,470
We're just the side characters.

4937
02:50:07,790 --> 02:50:08,810
Not fair.

4938
02:50:09,350 --> 02:50:12,090
Why can't we be the main character?

4939
02:50:13,010 --> 02:50:13,690
Wait!

4940
02:50:13,930 --> 02:50:14,530
Yes!

4941
02:50:14,610 --> 02:50:14,990
Yes!

4942
02:50:15,250 --> 02:50:15,850
No!

4943
02:50:15,850 --> 02:50:16,510
No way!

4944
02:50:16,770 --> 02:50:18,930
They have fucking blood armor, bro.

4945
02:50:18,930 --> 02:50:19,270
Bro, no.

4946
02:50:19,290 --> 02:50:20,590
This team is the main character.

4947
02:50:20,730 --> 02:50:21,430
It's not fair.

4948
02:50:22,010 --> 02:50:22,850
What is this?

4949
02:50:23,430 --> 02:50:24,950
This is actually not fair.

4950
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:30,310
The fact that all four of them are still alive after all that too.

4951
02:50:32,550 --> 02:50:35,750
Bro, this tournament is their stream, not our stream.

4952
02:50:39,690 --> 02:50:43,290
I feel like Naughty has been going kind of crazy these games.

4953
02:50:43,970 --> 02:50:45,110
Yeah, I know he has.

4954
02:50:45,190 --> 02:50:45,570
It's okay.

4955
02:50:47,030 --> 02:50:47,830
It's okay.

4956
02:50:47,830 --> 02:50:51,910
Guys, he deserves the money more than me.

4957
02:50:54,190 --> 02:50:55,110
It's okay, guys.

4958
02:50:55,170 --> 02:50:55,870
I have you guys.

4959
02:50:57,470 --> 02:50:58,650
I don't need...

4960
02:50:58,650 --> 02:50:59,770
He has eight kills.

4961
02:50:59,910 --> 02:51:00,370
It's okay.

4962
02:51:00,670 --> 02:51:02,450
We don't need the prize money.

4963
02:51:02,770 --> 02:51:04,870
It was just gonna go to tempo anyway.

4964
02:51:04,950 --> 02:51:06,730
He's going for the kill leader.

4965
02:51:07,430 --> 02:51:08,830
Oh yeah, the kill leader bonus.

4966
02:51:09,250 --> 02:51:10,970
Are you guys close to the kill leader bonus?

4967
02:51:11,630 --> 02:51:12,390
Hell no.

4968
02:51:12,490 --> 02:51:13,010
What the fuck?

4969
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:13,650
Hell no.

4970
02:51:13,650 --> 02:51:13,710
Hell no.

4971
02:51:19,270 --> 02:51:20,410
It's okay, guys.

4972
02:51:22,590 --> 02:51:25,930
The prize money was gonna go to the tempo peak anyway.

4973
02:51:25,930 --> 02:51:26,870
We don't need it.

4974
02:51:31,350 --> 02:51:33,010
How are they not dead?

4975
02:51:33,010 --> 02:51:33,870
They are top three.

4976
02:51:34,190 --> 02:51:36,930
Bro, that lifeline is about to run at someone.

4977
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:37,490
She's alive.

4978
02:51:37,670 --> 02:51:38,090
She's alive.

4979
02:51:38,170 --> 02:51:38,610
She's alive.

4980
02:51:38,850 --> 02:51:39,330
She's alive.

4981
02:51:39,330 --> 02:51:40,070
She's alive.

4982
02:51:40,150 --> 02:51:40,210
She's alive.

4983
02:51:40,210 --> 02:51:40,290
She's alive.

4984
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:40,290
She's alive.

4985
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:40,290
She's alive.

4986
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:40,290
She's alive.

4987
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:40,290
She's alive.

4988
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:40,290
She's alive.

4989
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:40,290
She's alive.

4990
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:40,710
And she tapped!

4991
02:51:42,690 --> 02:51:44,230
Oh my god.

4992
02:51:44,390 --> 02:51:45,770
How are they living?

4993
02:51:45,990 --> 02:51:46,950
Someone at least kill one.

4994
02:51:46,950 --> 02:51:48,110
Bring one of them down!

4995
02:51:48,790 --> 02:51:50,150
Oh my god!

4996
02:51:50,250 --> 02:51:51,390
She gets the res again!

4997
02:51:52,190 --> 02:51:53,050
Oh my god!

4998
02:51:53,670 --> 02:51:54,930
She died finally!

4999
02:51:56,530 --> 02:51:57,570
Jesus Christ!

5000
02:51:58,470 --> 02:51:59,510
Oh my god!

5001
02:51:59,770 --> 02:52:00,630
Wait, the Rampart!

5002
02:52:00,770 --> 02:52:04,090
The Rampart is living for free!

5003
02:52:04,850 --> 02:52:05,690
Oh my god!

5004
02:52:05,850 --> 02:52:08,450
How did she just do that with a 3x?

5005
02:52:08,810 --> 02:52:09,530
Did the Rampart win?

5006
02:52:10,110 --> 02:52:11,230
No, no, no.

5007
02:52:11,470 --> 02:52:13,110
She got second though.

5008
02:52:13,110 --> 02:52:13,490
Yeah.

5009
02:52:15,150 --> 02:52:18,370
The moment the Lifeline died, it was all over for this team.

5010
02:52:18,610 --> 02:52:20,150
Some crazy hating right there.

5011
02:52:20,310 --> 02:52:23,390
The more we hate, the more they succeed.

5012
02:52:26,050 --> 02:52:27,370
We need to...

5013
02:52:27,370 --> 02:52:28,790
increase our hate game.

5014
02:52:29,350 --> 02:52:31,470
No, the more we hate, the better they do!

5015
02:52:31,590 --> 02:52:31,830
No, no, no.

5016
02:52:32,070 --> 02:52:35,070
Because we're just not on the level of Kendrick Lamar yet.

5017
02:52:35,230 --> 02:52:35,810
You know?

5018
02:52:35,950 --> 02:52:38,530
We're not depressed enough to...

5019
02:52:40,590 --> 02:52:42,030
to vent out.

5020
02:52:42,350 --> 02:52:43,090
Wait a minute.

5021
02:52:43,110 --> 02:52:43,270
Wait a minute.

5022
02:52:45,110 --> 02:52:45,950
I'm sweating.

5023
02:52:48,630 --> 02:52:49,510
Oh my god.

5024
02:52:49,570 --> 02:52:51,010
Okay, LG guys, come on.

5025
02:52:51,070 --> 02:52:52,030
Guys, it's LG.

5026
02:52:52,270 --> 02:52:54,210
We gotta at least get top 6, guys.

5027
02:52:54,950 --> 02:52:56,550
That last game was unfortunate.

5028
02:52:57,070 --> 02:52:58,810
I would like some Boba money.

5029
02:52:59,050 --> 02:53:00,010
I don't know about y'all.

5030
02:53:00,150 --> 02:53:01,530
What kind of fucking Boba are you ordering?

5031
02:53:01,870 --> 02:53:03,890
Damn, $100 for Boba?

5032
02:53:03,910 --> 02:53:05,690
$100 for Boba?

5033
02:53:05,770 --> 02:53:07,390
You can get at least...

5034
02:53:07,390 --> 02:53:08,830
Are you living in LA?

5035
02:53:08,970 --> 02:53:09,790
Don't dox yourself.

5036
02:53:10,230 --> 02:53:11,750
Oh, you old...

5037
02:53:13,110 --> 02:53:13,470
You old and cis.

5038
02:53:15,970 --> 02:53:16,750
It's okay.

5039
02:53:16,950 --> 02:53:18,210
I live in...

5040
02:53:18,910 --> 02:53:21,890
like 30 to 45 minutes away from LA.

5041
02:53:22,190 --> 02:53:22,850
Oh, okay.

5042
02:53:22,890 --> 02:53:24,350
So it's not straight up LA LA.

5043
02:53:24,750 --> 02:53:25,310
Yeah.

5044
02:53:25,550 --> 02:53:26,290
That's better.

5045
02:53:26,630 --> 02:53:27,470
That's better.

5046
02:53:27,650 --> 02:53:30,250
And you don't have to pay like, you know, $100 for Boba.

5047
02:53:31,210 --> 02:53:32,350
Yeah, only $50.

5048
02:53:32,690 --> 02:53:33,790
Yeah, only $50.

5049
02:53:34,350 --> 02:53:37,110
I can get like 10 Bobas.

5050
02:53:37,530 --> 02:53:38,090
Oh.

5051
02:53:38,210 --> 02:53:38,730
Big toppings.

5052
02:53:39,190 --> 02:53:40,470
Maybe like...

5053
02:53:40,470 --> 02:53:42,210
What's your Boba?

5054
02:53:42,270 --> 02:53:43,470
What's your order?

5055
02:53:43,970 --> 02:53:45,130
What is your Boba order?

5056
02:53:45,790 --> 02:53:56,730
I think the last time I got Boba, I tried this like watermelon coconut milk thing from Yifong Tea.

5057
02:53:56,870 --> 02:53:57,310
Oh, what?

5058
02:53:58,330 --> 02:54:00,170
That sounds fancy.

5059
02:54:00,390 --> 02:54:06,050
It was like a featured seasonal menu and I got that and I didn't like it and I was...

5060
02:54:07,410 --> 02:54:08,090
Oh.

5061
02:54:08,090 --> 02:54:10,030
I was like mad at myself.

5062
02:54:10,210 --> 02:54:12,210
I was like, why would I do that to myself?

5063
02:54:12,630 --> 02:54:16,630
That is actually like the Boba experience whenever you try to get a new one.

5064
02:54:16,630 --> 02:54:17,030
Yeah, the fancy one.

5065
02:54:17,130 --> 02:54:18,770
The plain ones are the classics.

5066
02:54:18,810 --> 02:54:20,390
There's a reason why they're the classics.

5067
02:54:20,730 --> 02:54:21,150
True.

5068
02:54:21,990 --> 02:54:22,470
Yeah.

5069
02:54:22,530 --> 02:54:25,850
You put too much stuff in it, the flavor will just get too mixed up.

5070
02:54:26,650 --> 02:54:28,630
There are too many contrasting textures.

5071
02:54:29,070 --> 02:54:34,570
It's not Boba, but it was matcha and peach.

5072
02:54:35,170 --> 02:54:36,270
Somehow it was good.

5073
02:54:36,510 --> 02:54:37,870
That sounds good.

5074
02:54:38,090 --> 02:54:38,890
Yeah, that sounds good.

5075
02:54:39,190 --> 02:54:41,330
It was actually really good.

5076
02:54:42,270 --> 02:54:42,870
Yeah.

5077
02:54:43,810 --> 02:54:45,450
What's your Boba order, Preez?

5078
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:47,730
Uh...

5079
02:54:47,730 --> 02:54:49,470
I'm a basic b***h.

5080
02:54:50,670 --> 02:54:51,590
Milk tea?

5081
02:54:51,830 --> 02:54:54,530
Or brown sugar or Thai tea?

5082
02:54:54,930 --> 02:54:55,330
Oh.

5083
02:54:57,030 --> 02:54:59,510
Isn't Thai tea more sweet?

5084
02:54:59,670 --> 02:55:02,310
Yeah, I feel like you have a bit of a sweet tea.

5085
02:55:02,590 --> 02:55:03,730
Just for drinks.

5086
02:55:03,950 --> 02:55:04,550
That's it.

5087
02:55:04,670 --> 02:55:08,090
I don't eat any drinks.

5088
02:55:08,270 --> 02:55:10,510
Do you have at least Boba in your Boba tea?

5089
02:55:11,930 --> 02:55:12,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5090
02:55:13,570 --> 02:55:14,530
I get the balls.

5091
02:55:15,950 --> 02:55:17,070
You know what now?

5092
02:55:18,290 --> 02:55:18,830
I get the balls.

5093
02:55:18,830 --> 02:55:19,490
He gets the balls.

5094
02:55:19,850 --> 02:55:20,950
You get extra balls?

5095
02:55:21,330 --> 02:55:21,810
Yeah, the balls.

5096
02:55:21,810 --> 02:55:23,430
No, that's too many balls.

5097
02:55:24,710 --> 02:55:25,890
That's too much for me.

5098
02:55:26,730 --> 02:55:28,130
I can't take all that.

5099
02:55:29,690 --> 02:55:30,730
What am I eating?

5100
02:55:30,730 --> 02:55:31,450
Wait, what's your limit?

5101
02:55:31,630 --> 02:55:32,590
What's your ball limit?

5102
02:55:33,790 --> 02:55:35,570
You think I just count them?

5103
02:55:36,550 --> 02:55:37,370
I don't know.

5104
02:55:38,370 --> 02:55:42,530
Then how do you know when too many balls is too many if you don't have a limit?

5105
02:55:44,270 --> 02:55:45,570
I never thought about that.

5106
02:55:46,570 --> 02:55:47,330
I don't know.

5107
02:55:47,670 --> 02:55:50,110
That is a very good point.

5108
02:55:50,270 --> 02:55:50,290
Yeah.

5109
02:55:50,650 --> 02:55:51,570
Just ask for the balls.

5110
02:55:51,690 --> 02:55:52,470
I don't see how many.

5111
02:55:53,090 --> 02:55:56,450
Do you ask for it like that though or do you say like pearls or Boba?

5112
02:55:56,450 --> 02:55:57,510
Give me the balls.

5113
02:55:57,630 --> 02:56:00,230
Give me some balls please.

5114
02:56:04,270 --> 02:56:05,390
Oh my god.

5115
02:56:05,390 --> 02:56:07,310
What are the normal ones called?

5116
02:56:07,630 --> 02:56:08,310
Tapioca?

5117
02:56:08,490 --> 02:56:08,630
Yeah.

5118
02:56:09,130 --> 02:56:09,470
Boba.

5119
02:56:09,830 --> 02:56:12,270
They started adding all these crazy...

5120
02:56:12,270 --> 02:56:14,490
They started adding like the crazy ones.

5121
02:56:14,630 --> 02:56:15,930
There's popping Bobas.

5122
02:56:16,010 --> 02:56:18,070
Those are advanced.

5123
02:56:18,430 --> 02:56:23,490
Only the advanced Boba drinkers can deal the popping ones.

5124
02:56:25,410 --> 02:56:26,570
The advanced.

5125
02:56:27,790 --> 02:56:31,070
You gotta level up before you can take on the poppers.

5126
02:56:31,790 --> 02:56:33,270
I'm not that advanced.

5127
02:56:34,650 --> 02:56:37,590
Popping Boba with like a fruit tea is good though.

5128
02:56:37,730 --> 02:56:38,290
Mmm.

5129
02:56:38,710 --> 02:56:39,070
True.

5130
02:56:39,210 --> 02:56:40,410
I feel like that is a good combo.

5131
02:56:40,410 --> 02:56:41,430
There's also the tiny ones.

5132
02:56:41,570 --> 02:56:42,490
The tiny balls.

5133
02:56:43,590 --> 02:56:44,150
Oh.

5134
02:56:44,170 --> 02:56:44,650
Yeah.

5135
02:56:44,650 --> 02:56:44,970
Yeah.

5136
02:56:45,110 --> 02:56:46,350
There's tiny ones.

5137
02:56:46,370 --> 02:56:47,390
The really tiny ones.

5138
02:56:47,390 --> 02:56:47,930
Yeah.

5139
02:56:49,190 --> 02:56:51,310
That's scary to let you...

5140
02:56:52,210 --> 02:56:52,770
Wait.

5141
02:56:52,790 --> 02:56:53,810
In Boba?

5142
02:56:54,210 --> 02:56:54,770
Yeah.

5143
02:56:54,950 --> 02:56:55,390
Yeah.

5144
02:56:55,610 --> 02:57:01,250
You mix the big and the tiny ones together and the texture is really nice.

5145
02:57:01,330 --> 02:57:01,630
Yeah.

5146
02:57:01,710 --> 02:57:02,070
No.

5147
02:57:02,130 --> 02:57:03,170
You should try the texture.

5148
02:57:04,070 --> 02:57:05,530
I'm gonna try that next time.

5149
02:57:05,630 --> 02:57:06,090
Yeah.

5150
02:57:06,150 --> 02:57:08,410
The big and small balls.

5151
02:57:08,690 --> 02:57:11,430
I get the big and small balls.

5152
02:57:11,550 --> 02:57:11,750
Hey.

5153
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:12,950
You got the small balls.

5154
02:57:14,030 --> 02:57:16,230
They're gonna tie to you with some small balls.

5155
02:57:17,390 --> 02:57:17,870
Oh.

5156
02:57:18,910 --> 02:57:19,390
Oh.

5157
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:21,110
And then there's like the...

5158
02:57:21,110 --> 02:57:22,690
There's like the jelly too.

5159
02:57:22,790 --> 02:57:25,010
There's jelly and there's pudding as well.

5160
02:57:25,050 --> 02:57:25,110
Oh.

5161
02:57:25,110 --> 02:57:26,030
I've had the jelly.

5162
02:57:26,070 --> 02:57:26,590
Jelly's good.

5163
02:57:26,830 --> 02:57:27,270
Yeah.

5164
02:57:27,290 --> 02:57:28,830
There's like different flavors for jelly.

5165
02:57:29,750 --> 02:57:31,410
I like the lychee jelly.

5166
02:57:31,550 --> 02:57:31,750
Oh.

5167
02:57:31,750 --> 02:57:32,550
The lychee jelly's good.

5168
02:57:33,270 --> 02:57:34,470
Now I wanna order Boba tea.

5169
02:57:35,850 --> 02:57:37,570
I wanna order me some L.A.

5170
02:57:37,670 --> 02:57:38,150
Boba tea.

5171
02:57:38,550 --> 02:57:38,990
Yeah.

5172
02:57:39,010 --> 02:57:40,390
I think if we win you can...

5173
02:57:40,390 --> 02:57:40,630
Yeah.

5174
02:57:40,650 --> 02:57:42,950
I can order my one Boba tea from L.A.

5175
02:57:42,970 --> 02:57:44,430
You can have L.A.

5176
02:57:44,450 --> 02:57:47,370
Boba shipped out to you at your hundred dollars.

5177
02:57:48,090 --> 02:57:48,970
That's true.

5178
02:57:49,910 --> 02:57:50,350
True.

5179
02:57:50,450 --> 02:57:53,630
And then it'll just arrive like a singular cup at your doorstep.

5180
02:57:56,150 --> 02:57:56,590
Guys.

5181
02:57:56,610 --> 02:57:56,910
Please.

5182
02:57:57,230 --> 02:57:57,670
Guys.

5183
02:57:57,790 --> 02:57:58,950
I need that hundred dollars.

5184
02:57:59,330 --> 02:58:01,150
Or I'm not gonna get my Boba tea.

5185
02:58:04,850 --> 02:58:05,330
Wait.

5186
02:58:05,470 --> 02:58:06,850
You never said what you get.

5187
02:58:07,150 --> 02:58:07,610
Oh.

5188
02:58:07,630 --> 02:58:08,170
What I get?

5189
02:58:08,270 --> 02:58:09,510
I'm also simple.

5190
02:58:09,610 --> 02:58:11,590
I like the green milk tea.

5191
02:58:11,770 --> 02:58:12,870
And also...

5192
02:58:14,330 --> 02:58:16,930
And also like mango green milk tea.

5193
02:58:16,990 --> 02:58:17,750
It's really nice.

5194
02:58:17,870 --> 02:58:20,190
I love mango green milk tea.

5195
02:58:21,050 --> 02:58:21,530
Eww.

5196
02:58:22,970 --> 02:58:25,370
I don't like regular milk tea.

5197
02:58:25,430 --> 02:58:26,910
I like the green milk tea ones.

5198
02:58:27,010 --> 02:58:27,830
It just has more flavor.

5199
02:58:30,330 --> 02:58:31,010
Maybe.

5200
02:58:31,010 --> 02:58:31,230
Uh.

5201
02:58:31,970 --> 02:58:32,650
Guys.

5202
02:58:32,790 --> 02:58:35,030
What happened to Naughty's team?

5203
02:58:35,450 --> 02:58:35,930
What?

5204
02:58:37,390 --> 02:58:38,650
What's happening?

5205
02:58:38,670 --> 02:58:39,450
This is a team.

5206
02:58:39,630 --> 02:58:40,790
It's their lifeline.

5207
02:58:43,790 --> 02:58:44,470
No.

5208
02:58:44,470 --> 02:58:45,150
No.

5209
02:58:45,190 --> 02:58:45,310
No.

5210
02:58:45,310 --> 02:58:47,150
They just went into a team.

5211
02:58:47,390 --> 02:58:47,890
Yeah.

5212
02:58:47,890 --> 02:58:48,070
Yeah.

5213
02:58:48,110 --> 02:58:48,290
Yeah.

5214
02:58:48,750 --> 02:58:49,430
Okay.

5215
02:58:50,170 --> 02:58:51,150
Oh my god.

5216
02:58:51,270 --> 02:58:51,690
Wait.

5217
02:58:51,710 --> 02:58:52,730
They started it?

5218
02:58:53,570 --> 02:58:55,350
Say he's on the wrong team.

5219
02:58:56,950 --> 02:58:57,630
Oh.

5220
02:58:57,830 --> 02:58:58,010
Oh my god.

5221
02:58:58,590 --> 02:58:59,190
Guys.

5222
02:58:59,790 --> 02:59:00,710
Maybe we...

5223
02:59:00,710 --> 02:59:02,770
Maybe we cursed your IRL.

5224
02:59:03,250 --> 02:59:03,630
Wait.

5225
02:59:03,770 --> 02:59:04,370
She...

5226
02:59:04,370 --> 02:59:05,490
Yeah.

5227
02:59:05,550 --> 02:59:06,090
Yeah.

5228
02:59:06,230 --> 02:59:08,050
It didn't work in game.

5229
02:59:08,210 --> 02:59:09,450
We actually...

5230
02:59:09,450 --> 02:59:12,850
Her internet crashed.

5231
02:59:13,090 --> 02:59:13,690
Guys.

5232
02:59:13,690 --> 02:59:15,130
We're not liable for this.

5233
02:59:15,210 --> 02:59:16,230
We all have alibis.

5234
02:59:16,570 --> 02:59:18,030
Her internet crashed.

5235
02:59:18,050 --> 02:59:18,330
Oh no.

5236
02:59:18,570 --> 02:59:19,030
Oh no.

5237
02:59:19,190 --> 02:59:19,630
Oh no.

5238
02:59:20,070 --> 02:59:21,490
That's so sad.

5239
02:59:22,030 --> 02:59:24,630
Are we bad people?

5240
02:59:24,990 --> 02:59:25,110
Oh.

5241
02:59:25,110 --> 02:59:25,490
Fuck.

5242
02:59:25,490 --> 02:59:25,930
Get back.

5243
02:59:26,010 --> 02:59:26,970
Get back.

5244
02:59:27,830 --> 02:59:28,410
No.

5245
02:59:28,410 --> 02:59:30,810
I never pretended to be a good person.

5246
02:59:31,270 --> 02:59:31,870
Fuck.

5247
02:59:32,630 --> 02:59:33,230
Fuck.

5248
02:59:34,150 --> 02:59:35,290
Oh no.

5249
02:59:35,630 --> 02:59:36,190
No.

5250
02:59:36,270 --> 02:59:36,530
It's okay.

5251
02:59:36,590 --> 02:59:37,670
She's back now.

5252
02:59:38,690 --> 02:59:38,770
Oh.

5253
02:59:40,470 --> 02:59:42,150
That's so good for her.

5254
02:59:43,770 --> 02:59:44,370
Dumb.

5255
02:59:44,370 --> 02:59:44,370
Dumb.

5256
02:59:44,370 --> 02:59:45,170
We like to see.

5257
02:59:46,130 --> 02:59:46,730
Fuck.

5258
02:59:48,570 --> 02:59:49,330
It's okay.

5259
02:59:49,470 --> 02:59:51,450
That means like if she crashed now.

5260
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:53,130
That means she can crash again.

5261
02:59:53,750 --> 02:59:54,350
True.

5262
02:59:54,350 --> 02:59:54,470
True.

5263
02:59:58,130 --> 03:00:00,670
So like there's hope for us.

5264
03:00:02,170 --> 03:00:02,890
Alright.

5265
03:00:03,090 --> 03:00:04,210
The team fused.

5266
03:00:04,270 --> 03:00:05,810
Long ass fucking tournament.

5267
03:00:06,290 --> 03:00:07,010
Yeah.

5268
03:00:07,070 --> 03:00:08,850
I'm tired.

5269
03:00:09,590 --> 03:00:13,190
I feel like we spent more time in the lobby.

5270
03:00:13,470 --> 03:00:13,790
I feel like we spent more time in the lobby.

5271
03:00:14,130 --> 03:00:17,490
But it just means that we have a...

5272
03:00:17,490 --> 03:00:18,450
But it just means that we have a...

5273
03:00:18,450 --> 03:00:19,950
More time to strategize.

5274
03:00:20,090 --> 03:00:20,810
Okay.

5275
03:00:21,210 --> 03:00:21,530
Okay.

5276
03:00:21,530 --> 03:00:21,870
Yeah.

5277
03:00:22,170 --> 03:00:22,610
Bahankee.

5278
03:00:23,550 --> 03:00:25,370
Talk about fucking Milfman here.

5279
03:00:25,370 --> 03:00:27,430
I was gonna say hate but...

5280
03:00:27,430 --> 03:00:29,110
More time to hate on others.

5281
03:00:29,450 --> 03:00:29,750
Okay.

5282
03:00:29,810 --> 03:00:31,090
But realistically speaking.

5283
03:00:31,230 --> 03:00:33,390
What else have we done to strategize?

5284
03:00:33,390 --> 03:00:34,370
Outside of our comp.

5285
03:00:35,330 --> 03:00:36,470
I don't think anything...

5286
03:00:36,470 --> 03:00:38,570
We know what boba to order next time.

5287
03:00:38,610 --> 03:00:39,050
I don't know.

5288
03:00:39,350 --> 03:00:39,790
IGL?

5289
03:00:40,570 --> 03:00:41,010
IGL.

5290
03:00:41,050 --> 03:00:42,210
What were you supposed to do?

5291
03:00:42,270 --> 03:00:42,710
IGL?

5292
03:00:43,170 --> 03:00:43,570
Nah.

5293
03:00:43,610 --> 03:00:46,030
I was just listening to your guys' boba conversation.

5294
03:00:46,390 --> 03:00:46,630
You know.

5295
03:00:46,670 --> 03:00:47,390
I had a fun time.

5296
03:00:47,530 --> 03:00:48,650
I know what to order now.

5297
03:00:48,730 --> 03:00:48,950
You know?

5298
03:00:48,950 --> 03:00:49,270
Yeah.

5299
03:00:49,450 --> 03:00:51,490
But how are you gonna order boba tea?

5300
03:00:51,570 --> 03:00:52,410
We don't win anything.

5301
03:00:52,690 --> 03:00:54,530
We don't have some money.

5302
03:00:54,530 --> 03:00:55,990
I got third last game.

5303
03:00:56,050 --> 03:00:56,810
That's you problem.

5304
03:00:57,110 --> 03:00:58,310
You died first.

5305
03:00:58,930 --> 03:01:00,810
I got boba for one week.

5306
03:01:01,310 --> 03:01:02,330
For a week.

5307
03:01:02,850 --> 03:01:04,090
I'm fed for a week.

5308
03:01:04,350 --> 03:01:04,790
Okay.

5309
03:01:04,790 --> 03:01:05,530
But like...

5310
03:01:05,530 --> 03:01:07,230
What about the rest of us?

5311
03:01:07,390 --> 03:01:09,510
All I'm saying is Doki called us broke.

5312
03:01:09,950 --> 03:01:10,470
Yeah.

5313
03:01:13,250 --> 03:01:15,010
She said you broke us.

5314
03:01:15,110 --> 03:01:15,450
Fuck you.

5315
03:01:16,490 --> 03:01:17,010
Okay.

5316
03:01:17,010 --> 03:01:17,530
Yeah.

5317
03:01:18,950 --> 03:01:19,690
You're projecting.

5318
03:01:20,290 --> 03:01:21,250
I'm kidding.

5319
03:01:23,210 --> 03:01:23,770
Beacons.

5320
03:01:24,190 --> 03:01:24,750
Yay.

5321
03:01:25,530 --> 03:01:27,490
I wish I'm that broke fuck.

5322
03:01:31,890 --> 03:01:33,430
You should land there, Doki.

5323
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:34,530
On your thing.

5324
03:01:34,630 --> 03:01:34,990
Yeah.

5325
03:01:34,990 --> 03:01:35,330
Yeah.

5326
03:01:35,330 --> 03:01:35,410
Yeah.

5327
03:01:35,410 --> 03:01:36,310
Oh my god.

5328
03:01:36,370 --> 03:01:36,930
We got everything.

5329
03:01:37,350 --> 03:01:39,330
I'll land here.

5330
03:01:40,890 --> 03:01:42,410
Can I double scan?

5331
03:01:43,430 --> 03:01:43,990
No.

5332
03:01:44,390 --> 03:01:46,830
And then you're just gonna get a gold res.

5333
03:01:46,990 --> 03:01:47,850
And she's gonna be her.

5334
03:01:49,290 --> 03:01:49,770
Nice.

5335
03:01:50,770 --> 03:01:53,510
Can you get a gold knockoff drop?

5336
03:01:53,890 --> 03:01:55,310
Can you get in like a bin?

5337
03:01:55,510 --> 03:01:55,870
Yeah.

5338
03:01:55,970 --> 03:01:56,310
You can.

5339
03:01:56,490 --> 03:01:57,250
You're gonna be her.

5340
03:01:57,430 --> 03:01:57,890
I believe.

5341
03:01:58,510 --> 03:01:58,990
Okay.

5342
03:01:59,490 --> 03:02:00,690
I'll try my best.

5343
03:02:00,750 --> 03:02:01,890
Land on the little pill there.

5344
03:02:02,350 --> 03:02:02,830
Yeah.

5345
03:02:02,990 --> 03:02:05,050
I just wanted to tag along.

5346
03:02:05,190 --> 03:02:05,690
I'm sorry.

5347
03:02:07,710 --> 03:02:08,190
No!

5348
03:02:09,570 --> 03:02:10,050
No!

5349
03:02:10,650 --> 03:02:11,130
No!

5350
03:02:13,490 --> 03:02:15,010
We had everything.

5351
03:02:15,430 --> 03:02:17,370
Our beacons.

5352
03:02:17,370 --> 03:02:20,550
We really had everything.

5353
03:02:20,590 --> 03:02:22,870
Dude, does Tembo hate you?

5354
03:02:23,290 --> 03:02:25,690
He hates all of us.

5355
03:02:25,750 --> 03:02:27,230
Oh my god.

5356
03:02:27,670 --> 03:02:27,990
Oh my god.

5357
03:02:28,730 --> 03:02:34,330
If we don't get a beacon next game, I am accidentally crashing my game.

5358
03:02:35,490 --> 03:02:36,130
Accidentally.

5359
03:02:36,130 --> 03:02:38,150
I'm also gonna accidentally crash.

5360
03:02:38,510 --> 03:02:39,550
Holy shit.

5361
03:02:40,030 --> 03:02:41,290
How is this...

5362
03:02:41,290 --> 03:02:42,930
That's like actually so cruel.

5363
03:02:43,090 --> 03:02:44,550
Because we literally had everything.

5364
03:02:44,590 --> 03:02:46,350
And he just took it away from us.

5365
03:02:49,130 --> 03:02:52,490
We felt hope for like five seconds.

5366
03:02:53,550 --> 03:02:54,650
That's the...

5367
03:02:55,470 --> 03:02:57,930
That's the most happiness I felt in this tournament.

5368
03:03:00,010 --> 03:03:01,330
What was that?

5369
03:03:01,450 --> 03:03:02,750
What was that?

5370
03:03:02,810 --> 03:03:03,770
What did they do to you?

5371
03:03:04,090 --> 03:03:05,190
What did they...

5372
03:03:05,190 --> 03:03:10,050
Are you okay?

5373
03:03:10,330 --> 03:03:10,670
Man.

5374
03:03:11,250 --> 03:03:12,610
I'm so sad.

5375
03:03:13,550 --> 03:03:15,450
That was the boba money.

5376
03:03:16,350 --> 03:03:17,730
That was it!

5377
03:03:17,770 --> 03:03:18,410
That was it!

5378
03:03:18,550 --> 03:03:19,830
That was it right there!

5379
03:03:20,070 --> 03:03:23,650
I was already thinking about the small and big balls.

5380
03:03:24,190 --> 03:03:26,110
I was ready.

5381
03:03:28,150 --> 03:03:30,630
Where will my balls go now?

5382
03:03:30,970 --> 03:03:33,010
What the hell?

5383
03:03:35,590 --> 03:03:37,610
Oh my god, how could they?

5384
03:03:38,030 --> 03:03:39,710
I'm actually heartbroken.

5385
03:03:41,910 --> 03:03:47,110
We felt hope that maybe this game will be different.

5386
03:03:49,430 --> 03:03:50,870
He was there, man.

5387
03:03:51,110 --> 03:03:51,830
He was there.

5388
03:03:52,270 --> 03:03:53,810
I feel like I'm about to have nothing again.

5389
03:03:58,360 --> 03:03:59,200
Oh my god.

5390
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:03,840
It's okay.

5391
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:05,520
It's okay.

5392
03:04:05,760 --> 03:04:06,360
Maybe...

5393
03:04:06,360 --> 03:04:08,620
Maybe we'll get everything again.

5394
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:09,800
Yeah.

5395
03:04:10,120 --> 03:04:10,720
Maybe.

5396
03:04:11,520 --> 03:04:13,460
Okay, who are we blaming?

5397
03:04:13,620 --> 03:04:15,060
Who fucked up here?

5398
03:04:15,560 --> 03:04:16,300
I don't know.

5399
03:04:16,600 --> 03:04:19,380
I think Tempo fucked up here.

5400
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:22,740
Who fucked us over?

5401
03:04:23,400 --> 03:04:26,300
I think us actually preying on her downfall fucked us.

5402
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:27,660
I think it was her that crashed again.

5403
03:04:28,760 --> 03:04:30,500
Was it actually her?

5404
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:32,240
I'm pretty sure it was her again.

5405
03:04:32,600 --> 03:04:35,640
No, I don't think it was her.

5406
03:04:35,800 --> 03:04:37,840
No, I don't think it was her.

5407
03:04:38,200 --> 03:04:39,080
Karma's not real.

5408
03:04:39,180 --> 03:04:39,820
There's no way.

5409
03:04:41,140 --> 03:04:43,060
Oh yeah, RainDay said it.

5410
03:04:43,060 --> 03:04:43,900
Yeah.

5411
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:45,360
There's no way.

5412
03:04:45,780 --> 03:04:46,460
It's okay.

5413
03:04:46,660 --> 03:04:47,520
We'll get it again.

5414
03:04:48,160 --> 03:04:50,960
What if... what if we don't?

5415
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:52,440
We will trust.

5416
03:04:52,960 --> 03:04:54,600
Don't put that energy out there.

5417
03:04:54,920 --> 03:04:58,860
If we don't get it again, should we just run into the first team we see?

5418
03:04:58,880 --> 03:04:59,240
Yes.

5419
03:04:59,600 --> 03:05:04,000
I actually am confident in our fighting ability.

5420
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:07,320
I think, honestly speaking, we're not thinkers.

5421
03:05:07,500 --> 03:05:09,000
We should just uke uke one.

5422
03:05:09,400 --> 03:05:11,280
We should just grief a team.

5423
03:05:12,340 --> 03:05:13,040
And that's it.

5424
03:05:13,060 --> 03:05:14,660
That would make me feel a little bit of happiness.

5425
03:05:14,660 --> 03:05:15,240
What if we die?

5426
03:05:16,640 --> 03:05:17,520
You don't.

5427
03:05:17,520 --> 03:05:18,000
You don't.

5428
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:19,060
You don't think that.

5429
03:05:19,560 --> 03:05:20,420
Okay, you're right.

5430
03:05:20,460 --> 03:05:20,920
We'll be positive.

5431
03:05:21,120 --> 03:05:27,120
If we have the balls of a controller squad and just like eight them, they'll be caught off guard.

5432
03:05:27,380 --> 03:05:27,740
True.

5433
03:05:28,040 --> 03:05:29,680
And they'll give it for a little bit.

5434
03:05:29,780 --> 03:05:31,420
And that's all the advantage we need.

5435
03:05:31,500 --> 03:05:32,040
Oh, okay.

5436
03:05:32,180 --> 03:05:33,060
We got two.

5437
03:05:33,180 --> 03:05:33,720
We got two.

5438
03:05:34,020 --> 03:05:36,420
Oh, we got three fucking bloopins.

5439
03:05:36,420 --> 03:05:36,860
Oh shit.

5440
03:05:39,320 --> 03:05:39,860
That's good.

5441
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:40,720
The crash was good.

5442
03:05:41,380 --> 03:05:41,820
Okay.

5443
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:42,180
Okay.

5444
03:05:42,280 --> 03:05:42,500
Okay.

5445
03:05:43,060 --> 03:05:44,560
We land on that bridge one.

5446
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:46,820
I'm trying to fix my chat, guys.

5447
03:05:47,020 --> 03:05:47,900
I'm trying to fix you guys.

5448
03:05:48,520 --> 03:05:50,020
I'll fix you guys.

5449
03:05:51,340 --> 03:05:51,860
Okay.

5450
03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:53,080
Alright.

5451
03:05:53,500 --> 03:05:54,520
Who's jump master?

5452
03:05:54,640 --> 03:05:55,240
Okay, here we go.

5453
03:05:55,440 --> 03:05:56,280
I got it.

5454
03:05:58,100 --> 03:05:58,920
Solo jumping.

5455
03:06:00,140 --> 03:06:03,780
Bro, they really didn't put any ALGS rules.

5456
03:06:04,920 --> 03:06:05,960
I can Emo.

5457
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:07,140
There's heat shields.

5458
03:06:07,580 --> 03:06:09,360
Am I going over there?

5459
03:06:09,640 --> 03:06:10,660
Am I going over there?

5460
03:06:10,660 --> 03:06:12,620
All the way over there?

5461
03:06:14,100 --> 03:06:15,020
Am I going there?

5462
03:06:15,300 --> 03:06:17,460
I don't know where you reset.

5463
03:06:17,660 --> 03:06:18,860
Yeah, you're going to spacebar.

5464
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:19,540
Okay.

5465
03:06:19,560 --> 03:06:19,660
Okay.

5466
03:06:20,060 --> 03:06:21,840
I just got to make sure.

5467
03:06:24,020 --> 03:06:24,500
Yup.

5468
03:06:24,560 --> 03:06:24,940
Yup.

5469
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:26,720
Alright.

5470
03:06:26,760 --> 03:06:27,280
Here we go.

5471
03:06:29,800 --> 03:06:30,280
Oh.

5472
03:06:31,620 --> 03:06:33,120
We got to make it.

5473
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:34,440
We got to make it.

5474
03:06:34,540 --> 03:06:34,880
We got to make it.

5475
03:06:36,560 --> 03:06:38,740
I got three phoenixes.

5476
03:06:39,160 --> 03:06:39,640
Cool.

5477
03:06:39,640 --> 03:06:41,080
Hey, that's good.

5478
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:42,560
Phoenixes are rare.

5479
03:06:43,480 --> 03:06:44,420
I don't want all of them.

5480
03:06:44,660 --> 03:06:49,080
The scout goes crazy.

5481
03:06:49,300 --> 03:06:49,740
Four phoenixes.

5482
03:06:50,580 --> 03:06:51,800
I don't want all of these.

5483
03:06:51,800 --> 03:06:52,420
Oh, shit.

5484
03:06:54,360 --> 03:06:54,880
Eh.

5485
03:06:57,260 --> 03:06:57,780
Alright.

5486
03:07:02,100 --> 03:07:03,100
This is it, guys.

5487
03:07:03,240 --> 03:07:04,200
I believe in us.

5488
03:07:05,780 --> 03:07:06,740
I believe.

5489
03:07:07,080 --> 03:07:07,760
Let's see.

5490
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:14,380
I'm going to drop two of them by the crafter.

5491
03:07:17,240 --> 03:07:17,760
Alright.

5492
03:07:18,200 --> 03:07:19,200
Guys, this is it.

5493
03:07:19,280 --> 03:07:19,740
Bad zone.

5494
03:07:20,860 --> 03:07:21,380
Hey.

5495
03:07:24,900 --> 03:07:25,880
There's no way.

5496
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:27,120
There's no way.

5497
03:07:28,260 --> 03:07:29,920
We're not going to get top six.

5498
03:07:30,320 --> 03:07:31,920
Can you ping me?

5499
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:32,560
Yeah.

5500
03:07:32,900 --> 03:07:34,900
I have one here.

5501
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:36,240
I'll ping it in a second.

5502
03:07:36,540 --> 03:07:37,360
Let's see.

5503
03:07:39,640 --> 03:07:39,940
I'm going to go...

5504
03:07:39,940 --> 03:07:41,520
Actually, I'm going to go nemesis.

5505
03:07:41,580 --> 03:07:42,440
I feel like nemesis.

5506
03:07:42,540 --> 03:07:44,640
I'm better at nemesis than carbide.

5507
03:07:45,380 --> 03:07:45,940
I'm pretty sure.

5508
03:07:46,340 --> 03:07:46,780
Okay.

5509
03:07:50,220 --> 03:07:51,100
Where's the bolt?

5510
03:07:51,320 --> 03:07:53,320
I need that.

5511
03:07:55,320 --> 03:07:56,720
Dropping an extra bat here.

5512
03:07:57,400 --> 03:07:57,680
Wait.

5513
03:07:58,020 --> 03:07:58,920
Scout or bolt?

5514
03:08:00,500 --> 03:08:01,800
I meant bat.

5515
03:08:02,060 --> 03:08:03,480
Did I say something else?

5516
03:08:04,680 --> 03:08:05,120
Scout.

5517
03:08:05,240 --> 03:08:05,380
Scout.

5518
03:08:06,700 --> 03:08:07,780
Where is it?

5519
03:08:07,860 --> 03:08:08,480
I saw the bolt.

5520
03:08:08,700 --> 03:08:10,240
Where are the energy ammo?

5521
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:11,740
Ping it in a second.

5522
03:08:12,120 --> 03:08:13,460
Does anyone want a turbo?

5523
03:08:15,180 --> 03:08:15,820
Uh, yeah.

5524
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:17,640
Okay, there's a turbo somewhere here.

5525
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:18,760
Let's go this way.

5526
03:08:20,680 --> 03:08:21,640
Bring it.

5527
03:08:22,640 --> 03:08:24,780
Oh yeah, I need to try and find it.

5528
03:08:27,940 --> 03:08:29,740
Guys, I have a panel after this.

5529
03:08:30,080 --> 03:08:31,640
I'm so fucking ready.

5530
03:08:31,660 --> 03:08:32,100
Core is leaving.

5531
03:08:32,440 --> 03:08:33,900
I feel like a balloon over here.

5532
03:08:33,960 --> 03:08:34,360
Be careful.

5533
03:08:35,380 --> 03:08:35,840
I'm so ready.

5534
03:08:37,380 --> 03:08:38,340
Do you have any...

5535
03:08:38,340 --> 03:08:40,260
Get that Evo there.

5536
03:08:41,200 --> 03:08:42,360
Yeah, I'm heading over now.

5537
03:08:43,340 --> 03:08:43,820
Nice.

5538
03:08:45,020 --> 03:08:46,380
Two bats in here.

5539
03:08:47,540 --> 03:08:48,020
Whoa.

5540
03:08:48,180 --> 03:08:48,760
Did you find a scout?

5541
03:08:49,200 --> 03:08:49,680
Yeah.

5542
03:08:50,340 --> 03:08:51,680
She's not gonna make it.

5543
03:08:52,580 --> 03:08:54,320
I'm drinking water right now.

5544
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:55,720
Let's go to...

5545
03:08:56,260 --> 03:08:57,940
I can stand still here, right?

5546
03:09:00,020 --> 03:09:01,460
Where's he gonna be collecting cheese?

5547
03:09:01,880 --> 03:09:01,960
Hmm.

5548
03:09:02,980 --> 03:09:03,460
Okay.

5549
03:09:05,380 --> 03:09:06,160
Where's the turbo, guys?

5550
03:09:06,300 --> 03:09:09,920
It's kind of an awful hard zone if we don't get a spot right away.

5551
03:09:10,140 --> 03:09:11,080
Alright, I'm heading over.

5552
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:12,640
We're gonna be fighting a lot.

5553
03:09:13,620 --> 03:09:15,400
I don't remember where the turbo is.

5554
03:09:15,500 --> 03:09:15,760
I'm sorry.

5555
03:09:16,820 --> 03:09:18,740
You guys can start heading towards Core.

5556
03:09:18,760 --> 03:09:19,240
Yeah, I'm heading over.

5557
03:09:22,240 --> 03:09:23,980
Alright, I'm okay.

5558
03:09:24,280 --> 03:09:25,260
I'm okay, guys!

5559
03:09:25,660 --> 03:09:26,820
I swear to God!

5560
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:27,840
I'm okay now!

5561
03:09:28,240 --> 03:09:29,980
Should no one be here.

5562
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:32,260
Should I get that cheese?

5563
03:09:33,160 --> 03:09:33,680
Yup.

5564
03:09:33,720 --> 03:09:34,060
Yup.

5565
03:09:34,340 --> 03:09:35,560
We're gonna scan.

5566
03:09:36,760 --> 03:09:37,280
Okay.

5567
03:09:37,280 --> 03:09:38,480
I'm almost there.

5568
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:42,180
Oh, damn.

5569
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:43,440
I only have one bat.

5570
03:09:43,460 --> 03:09:44,440
That should stack.

5571
03:09:44,740 --> 03:09:46,240
I got two.

5572
03:09:47,700 --> 03:09:49,300
No one's playing from this side.

5573
03:09:49,300 --> 03:09:50,900
I don't think we're getting a house, guys.

5574
03:09:52,560 --> 03:09:56,960
Yeah, we should be able to scan from either that cliff base.

5575
03:09:57,180 --> 03:09:58,720
Or cliff side or alpha base.

5576
03:09:58,880 --> 03:09:59,700
I just fucking said two.

5577
03:09:59,700 --> 03:10:01,520
Yeah, there's a whole team in this house.

5578
03:10:05,630 --> 03:10:05,990
Alright.

5579
03:10:06,170 --> 03:10:06,450
Alright.

5580
03:10:06,550 --> 03:10:07,250
We should try and...

5581
03:10:07,250 --> 03:10:09,330
I'mma hit that alone in the zone.

5582
03:10:09,610 --> 03:10:09,630
Okay.

5583
03:10:10,250 --> 03:10:10,990
So we're just waiting for you.

5584
03:10:10,990 --> 03:10:12,590
Or maybe we could go for the third beacon, too.

5585
03:10:13,750 --> 03:10:15,230
Me and a prize will go on a mission.

5586
03:10:15,350 --> 03:10:16,570
Yeah, you guys hold from this building.

5587
03:10:16,890 --> 03:10:18,490
Which building?

5588
03:10:20,010 --> 03:10:20,890
This thing over here.

5589
03:10:21,070 --> 03:10:22,410
I want a house so I can blow my nose!

5590
03:10:22,650 --> 03:10:23,990
I need a house!

5591
03:10:24,330 --> 03:10:26,070
I can't stop moving!

5592
03:10:27,290 --> 03:10:29,150
I need a house so I can blow my nose!

5593
03:10:30,050 --> 03:10:31,490
I think we should go for the alpha.

5594
03:10:32,030 --> 03:10:32,470
Please!

5595
03:10:32,830 --> 03:10:33,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5596
03:10:36,550 --> 03:10:38,410
I need to blow my nose, please!

5597
03:10:38,830 --> 03:10:40,510
I feel like I heard something land that way.

5598
03:10:40,730 --> 03:10:41,350
I have a lot of notes.

5599
03:10:41,810 --> 03:10:42,950
I think those are the...

5600
03:10:43,390 --> 03:10:44,110
I think those are the...

5601
03:10:44,110 --> 03:10:48,690
I did hear that, too.

5602
03:10:48,770 --> 03:10:48,850
I did hear that, too.

5603
03:10:48,850 --> 03:10:49,930
That might have been the crafter.

5604
03:10:49,970 --> 03:10:50,550
I'm not sure.

5605
03:10:51,090 --> 03:10:52,770
I'm 200 off purple.

5606
03:10:53,190 --> 03:10:54,550
I can get cold now.

5607
03:10:55,310 --> 03:10:56,350
You can beat her!

5608
03:10:56,790 --> 03:10:57,590
You're gonna beat her!

5609
03:10:58,450 --> 03:10:59,710
We're gonna get her a red, too.

5610
03:11:02,690 --> 03:11:03,890
Guys, we got this.

5611
03:11:03,930 --> 03:11:07,070
The moment she has gold knocked down, it's over.

5612
03:11:08,070 --> 03:11:08,830
For them.

5613
03:11:08,890 --> 03:11:09,890
Not for us, by the way.

5614
03:11:10,610 --> 03:11:13,810
Just in case you guys don't know, it's over for them.

5615
03:11:13,950 --> 03:11:16,330
I'm gonna push her up here to see what this team is doing.

5616
03:11:17,110 --> 03:11:18,190
I'm gonna risk it.

5617
03:11:18,230 --> 03:11:18,590
Yeah, you're good.

5618
03:11:18,590 --> 03:11:19,550
They're on the other side.

5619
03:11:22,230 --> 03:11:23,430
We have purple!

5620
03:11:24,530 --> 03:11:25,190
Let's go!

5621
03:11:28,530 --> 03:11:28,970
Alright.

5622
03:11:29,630 --> 03:11:31,990
Where are we supposed to go here?

5623
03:11:32,710 --> 03:11:33,510
This building.

5624
03:11:33,950 --> 03:11:35,150
We're aiming for this building.

5625
03:11:35,410 --> 03:11:36,110
I think they're just...

5626
03:11:36,110 --> 03:11:37,990
I don't see them.

5627
03:11:40,050 --> 03:11:41,270
I'm gonna take the Evo cache.

5628
03:11:41,930 --> 03:11:42,850
Are you gonna take it?

5629
03:11:43,750 --> 03:11:44,690
I'll take it.

5630
03:11:45,350 --> 03:11:46,550
Send ult to Axel here.

5631
03:11:46,730 --> 03:11:47,650
I'm a little fridge!

5632
03:11:50,110 --> 03:11:50,590
Alright.

5633
03:11:53,090 --> 03:11:54,050
I have...

5634
03:11:54,050 --> 03:11:55,990
I need a stock.

5635
03:11:56,150 --> 03:11:56,950
Holy shit.

5636
03:11:58,190 --> 03:11:59,370
I have a stock.

5637
03:12:00,030 --> 03:12:01,990
I have one grey one.

5638
03:12:02,990 --> 03:12:04,910
They flew over from over here.

5639
03:12:05,150 --> 03:12:06,070
They left, okay.

5640
03:12:06,270 --> 03:12:07,350
Alright, start setting up there.

5641
03:12:07,390 --> 03:12:09,290
Or just chill here in this building.

5642
03:12:09,570 --> 03:12:11,370
We got scanned by cliffside.

5643
03:12:11,410 --> 03:12:11,670
Yeah.

5644
03:12:11,850 --> 03:12:13,490
I'm gonna zip us to the zones.

5645
03:12:13,650 --> 03:12:14,750
Or into the...

5646
03:12:15,710 --> 03:12:16,170
Beacons.

5647
03:12:16,190 --> 03:12:18,050
Put a wall for them and all that.

5648
03:12:19,090 --> 03:12:19,550
Okay.

5649
03:12:22,930 --> 03:12:23,390
Well...

5650
03:12:24,190 --> 03:12:24,930
We wait.

5651
03:12:29,450 --> 03:12:29,890
Alright.

5652
03:12:30,390 --> 03:12:30,830
Yay!

5653
03:12:31,030 --> 03:12:31,290
We got it.

5654
03:12:37,940 --> 03:12:39,100
She's over there too.

5655
03:12:40,220 --> 03:12:41,880
My team is so serious now.

5656
03:12:42,020 --> 03:12:42,900
This is the last game.

5657
03:12:42,980 --> 03:12:43,800
We gotta be serious.

5658
03:12:44,740 --> 03:12:45,740
We're so serious.

5659
03:12:46,740 --> 03:12:48,800
Is that a crafter or a mobile rose?

5660
03:12:50,680 --> 03:12:51,540
Probably the crafter.

5661
03:12:51,740 --> 03:12:52,000
I'm not sure.

5662
03:12:55,020 --> 03:12:55,460
Whoa.

5663
03:12:56,120 --> 03:12:58,040
I didn't even realize you guys were so far away.

5664
03:12:58,980 --> 03:12:59,420
Yeah.

5665
03:12:59,560 --> 03:12:59,760
Yeah.

5666
03:13:00,500 --> 03:13:01,140
Ooh.

5667
03:13:01,540 --> 03:13:02,720
There's two teams.

5668
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:03,760
No one here.

5669
03:13:04,100 --> 03:13:05,400
Yeah, no one's playing.

5670
03:13:05,540 --> 03:13:06,360
Oh my god.

5671
03:13:06,360 --> 03:13:07,500
There's a team in...

5672
03:13:07,500 --> 03:13:08,760
We could play here.

5673
03:13:09,100 --> 03:13:12,480
Nah, I'm gonna die.

5674
03:13:12,780 --> 03:13:14,740
I forgot I dropped my syringe.

5675
03:13:15,480 --> 03:13:17,180
Can you res me, Yuji?

5676
03:13:17,580 --> 03:13:18,060
Yeah.

5677
03:13:19,120 --> 03:13:19,760
Um...

5678
03:13:21,420 --> 03:13:23,540
We have to make a position.

5679
03:13:23,540 --> 03:13:24,120
Oh wait.

5680
03:13:24,280 --> 03:13:24,740
I'm dumb.

5681
03:13:25,720 --> 03:13:26,700
There's no one in here.

5682
03:13:27,580 --> 03:13:28,520
Do you want a heat shield?

5683
03:13:28,840 --> 03:13:29,800
Yeah, no one's in that building.

5684
03:13:29,900 --> 03:13:30,720
We should definitely go for that.

5685
03:13:30,780 --> 03:13:32,580
I think we can land from this building.

5686
03:13:33,480 --> 03:13:33,840
We're good.

5687
03:13:33,940 --> 03:13:34,060
We're good.

5688
03:13:34,120 --> 03:13:34,900
Yeah, let's go to this room.

5689
03:13:34,960 --> 03:13:37,060
I don't think there was anyone in any of... like both buildings.

5690
03:13:37,160 --> 03:13:37,580
Both buildings.

5691
03:13:37,680 --> 03:13:38,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5692
03:13:38,020 --> 03:13:38,240
Let's go.

5693
03:13:38,340 --> 03:13:38,460
Let's go.

5694
03:13:40,060 --> 03:13:42,400
This team did look like they were looking though, so...

5695
03:13:43,720 --> 03:13:44,300
Alright, come on.

5696
03:13:45,500 --> 03:13:46,800
Wait, let's pop a med kit together.

5697
03:13:47,280 --> 03:13:47,560
Yeah.

5698
03:13:47,560 --> 03:13:49,140
Well, can you drop the suckage?

5699
03:13:50,180 --> 03:13:50,460
Huh?

5700
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:51,600
Nothing, nothing.

5701
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:51,960
It's okay.

5702
03:13:52,080 --> 03:13:53,420
I don't have a med kit.

5703
03:13:53,720 --> 03:13:54,980
Oh yeah, I can drop you now.

5704
03:13:55,020 --> 03:13:56,360
Alright, everyone pop a med kit.

5705
03:13:57,880 --> 03:13:58,460
Oh wait.

5706
03:13:58,560 --> 03:13:59,180
Can you bring it up here?

5707
03:14:00,780 --> 03:14:01,140
Oh.

5708
03:14:01,800 --> 03:14:03,080
Are you guys okay?

5709
03:14:03,400 --> 03:14:04,840
We have 20 seconds, guys.

5710
03:14:05,860 --> 03:14:06,420
We'll be fine.

5711
03:14:07,560 --> 03:14:08,480
Alright, pop a med kit.

5712
03:14:09,820 --> 03:14:12,780
We're gonna go for either of the buildings, but probably this one.

5713
03:14:13,460 --> 03:14:14,380
I'm so sorry.

5714
03:14:14,700 --> 03:14:15,220
I think I'm...

5715
03:14:16,540 --> 03:14:18,080
Yeah, you can drop the suck.

5716
03:14:18,740 --> 03:14:19,880
Oh, they're breaking the balloon.

5717
03:14:20,460 --> 03:14:21,380
We might just have to take it.

5718
03:14:22,280 --> 03:14:22,800
Oh, no.

5719
03:14:22,960 --> 03:14:24,520
Oh, wait.

5720
03:14:24,640 --> 03:14:25,540
Doki has a balloon.

5721
03:14:25,700 --> 03:14:26,460
I do, I do.

5722
03:14:26,500 --> 03:14:26,740
I do.

5723
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:27,360
I dropped that balloon, Doki.

5724
03:14:27,560 --> 03:14:29,560
Someone else dropped it.

5725
03:14:29,720 --> 03:14:31,340
She actually dropped the balloon.

5726
03:14:31,480 --> 03:14:32,600
I dropped the balloon.

5727
03:14:32,980 --> 03:14:35,120
I don't trust my supposition in the balloon.

5728
03:14:36,380 --> 03:14:37,800
Take it, take it, take it.

5729
03:14:38,860 --> 03:14:40,460
What the fuck was that?

5730
03:14:40,580 --> 03:14:41,540
I'm gonna shoot for one of these.

5731
03:14:41,600 --> 03:14:42,500
I listened to orders.

5732
03:14:43,900 --> 03:14:44,900
Zip there now.

5733
03:14:45,800 --> 03:14:46,740
Go in here, go in here.

5734
03:14:46,780 --> 03:14:47,120
Fuck it.

5735
03:14:48,280 --> 03:14:48,620
Okay.

5736
03:14:50,540 --> 03:14:51,880
No one, no one, no one, no one.

5737
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:53,620
There's a cheese outside.

5738
03:14:54,080 --> 03:14:55,720
We're gonna go for the next one as well.

5739
03:14:55,900 --> 03:14:58,060
We get to live in the house.

5740
03:14:59,000 --> 03:14:59,700
No one's here.

5741
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:01,100
Okay, I'm closing this door.

5742
03:15:01,380 --> 03:15:02,620
Okay, guys.

5743
03:15:02,900 --> 03:15:04,700
I'm gonna AFK here for one second.

5744
03:15:04,820 --> 03:15:05,140
No, no, no.

5745
03:15:05,140 --> 03:15:06,320
We can't, we can't, Doki.

5746
03:15:06,640 --> 03:15:06,900
No!

5747
03:15:07,140 --> 03:15:08,560
I'm gonna blow my nose!

5748
03:15:09,360 --> 03:15:09,800
It's okay.

5749
03:15:09,940 --> 03:15:10,200
Later.

5750
03:15:10,820 --> 03:15:11,220
No!

5751
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:13,460
We made it in!

5752
03:15:14,980 --> 03:15:15,960
I'm gonna blow my nose.

5753
03:15:16,040 --> 03:15:16,700
I'm gonna blow my nose.

5754
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:17,400
Run zone, run zone.

5755
03:15:18,660 --> 03:15:19,580
Oh my god.

5756
03:15:19,860 --> 03:15:20,460
It's a miracle.

5757
03:15:20,460 --> 03:15:21,680
I didn't even see that.

5758
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:22,540
Holy shit.

5759
03:15:22,600 --> 03:15:23,540
Good call, good call.

5760
03:15:23,660 --> 03:15:24,440
Good call, guys!

5761
03:15:25,820 --> 03:15:27,080
We have a house!

5762
03:15:27,120 --> 03:15:27,940
And I blew my nose!

5763
03:15:28,560 --> 03:15:29,700
I want the sock.

5764
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:30,900
Oh my god.

5765
03:15:32,320 --> 03:15:33,260
Gonna get the joe.

5766
03:15:34,240 --> 03:15:35,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5767
03:15:36,020 --> 03:15:37,100
Back up, Doki, real quick.

5768
03:15:37,880 --> 03:15:39,320
Just out of our door!

5769
03:15:41,420 --> 03:15:42,640
Right here, Doki.

5770
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:45,080
I'm a mess right now after blowing my nose.

5771
03:15:45,080 --> 03:15:46,980
Sorry, no, no, no.

5772
03:15:50,540 --> 03:15:51,180
No!

5773
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:52,900
My Discord crashed!

5774
03:15:53,300 --> 03:15:53,460
No!

5775
03:15:54,160 --> 03:15:55,520
What just happened?

5776
03:15:55,840 --> 03:15:57,760
My Discord crashed!

5777
03:15:58,420 --> 03:16:00,100
Team right here now.

5778
03:16:00,120 --> 03:16:01,220
Guys, I'm a mess right now.

5779
03:16:01,560 --> 03:16:02,820
What is happening?

5780
03:16:03,220 --> 03:16:08,480
What fence is on this window as well?

5781
03:16:08,660 --> 03:16:09,380
Oh no.

5782
03:16:10,520 --> 03:16:11,300
Scary window.

5783
03:16:11,300 --> 03:16:12,180
We're gonna bounce forever.

5784
03:16:12,540 --> 03:16:12,860
Yeah.

5785
03:16:15,220 --> 03:16:16,800
You should not gonna bounce forever.

5786
03:16:17,500 --> 03:16:19,360
We moved together, you know?

5787
03:16:19,380 --> 03:16:20,400
Ape together strong.

5788
03:16:20,800 --> 03:16:21,040
Okay.

5789
03:16:21,200 --> 03:16:22,400
Just play together.

5790
03:16:22,760 --> 03:16:25,000
Are we shooting at it or on...

5791
03:16:25,580 --> 03:16:27,380
It's one problem after another.

5792
03:16:27,740 --> 03:16:29,360
Wait, there's a redeploy over there.

5793
03:16:30,940 --> 03:16:31,940
Alright, alright, alright.

5794
03:16:32,220 --> 03:16:33,160
We'll play Southwest.

5795
03:16:34,240 --> 03:16:35,500
I'm looking at them redeploying.

5796
03:16:35,500 --> 03:16:36,900
We're moving this, hold on.

5797
03:16:38,360 --> 03:16:39,420
Where are they going?

5798
03:16:41,620 --> 03:16:42,600
Where did they go?

5799
03:16:42,740 --> 03:16:43,280
They disappeared.

5800
03:16:43,920 --> 03:16:44,660
I don't know.

5801
03:16:44,820 --> 03:16:46,980
Yeah, I don't even see anything.

5802
03:16:47,220 --> 03:16:48,200
They actually just disappeared.

5803
03:16:48,320 --> 03:16:50,000
I was watching it.

5804
03:16:51,060 --> 03:16:52,080
There's a team over here.

5805
03:16:53,860 --> 03:16:54,340
Yup.

5806
03:16:56,460 --> 03:16:58,000
Why is no one here?

5807
03:16:58,340 --> 03:16:59,080
Me too.

5808
03:16:59,220 --> 03:17:00,420
Why is no one here?

5809
03:17:00,460 --> 03:17:00,760
Hello?

5810
03:17:00,940 --> 03:17:02,360
How do people know all these zones?

5811
03:17:02,620 --> 03:17:06,400
If no one's here, then do you think zone ends on the other side?

5812
03:17:06,940 --> 03:17:08,240
I mean, we have the zone knowledge.

5813
03:17:09,020 --> 03:17:09,900
Don't be a doomer.

5814
03:17:10,020 --> 03:17:10,660
Don't say that.

5815
03:17:10,860 --> 03:17:11,820
Don't say that.

5816
03:17:12,120 --> 03:17:14,120
We don't have redeploy.

5817
03:17:14,780 --> 03:17:15,660
Oh, my bad.

5818
03:17:17,220 --> 03:17:17,640
We have our zip.

5819
03:17:18,520 --> 03:17:19,860
Oh yeah, we have our zip.

5820
03:17:19,960 --> 03:17:20,320
You're right.

5821
03:17:20,460 --> 03:17:22,560
They might valk back here.

5822
03:17:23,800 --> 03:17:24,380
Oh yeah.

5823
03:17:24,920 --> 03:17:25,920
I see that, yeah.

5824
03:17:27,060 --> 03:17:27,900
They just rez.

5825
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:30,800
What the fuck are they doing?

5826
03:17:30,940 --> 03:17:31,680
It's a full team.

5827
03:17:31,780 --> 03:17:32,280
It's a full team.

5828
03:17:32,400 --> 03:17:33,860
There's definitely a different team there.

5829
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:36,000
I'm putting this wall back.

5830
03:17:38,640 --> 03:17:40,420
Alright, we're gonna find out in 14 seconds.

5831
03:17:43,140 --> 03:17:45,180
How is there still 14 squads?

5832
03:17:45,180 --> 03:17:48,000
There's literally only one team that has died this entire time.

5833
03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:49,000
That is crazy.

5834
03:17:49,640 --> 03:17:51,280
I'm a bit scared for you, man.

5835
03:17:52,120 --> 03:17:52,720
Don't worry.

5836
03:17:54,440 --> 03:17:55,500
I got this.

5837
03:17:56,420 --> 03:17:57,180
They're up here.

5838
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:00,700
There's at least two or three teams.

5839
03:18:00,700 --> 03:18:01,400
Oh, I got shot from height.

5840
03:18:02,220 --> 03:18:03,820
Woah, woah, woah.

5841
03:18:05,440 --> 03:18:07,200
I'm looking out in the glass right now.

5842
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:10,760
Speak of the reese, cause the doors are blocked.

5843
03:18:11,180 --> 03:18:12,100
Oh, there's a team right here!

5844
03:18:12,100 --> 03:18:13,720
There's a team in the other house next to us.

5845
03:18:15,780 --> 03:18:17,140
I'm gonna go in the other door.

5846
03:18:17,480 --> 03:18:17,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5847
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:18,060
They weren't here.

5848
03:18:20,020 --> 03:18:20,680
Open it real quick.

5849
03:18:20,880 --> 03:18:23,400
There's a team right here in front of me rotating right now.

5850
03:18:23,580 --> 03:18:24,340
Nah, I'm gonna move.

5851
03:18:25,980 --> 03:18:26,620
Holy shit!

5852
03:18:27,620 --> 03:18:29,220
Wait, can we get the thirst somehow?

5853
03:18:29,220 --> 03:18:29,920
I can't.

5854
03:18:30,060 --> 03:18:31,120
He's in this corner right here.

5855
03:18:31,260 --> 03:18:31,760
Yeah, we're trying.

5856
03:18:33,940 --> 03:18:35,700
I hit him for 100, his knockdown.

5857
03:18:37,740 --> 03:18:38,440
I don't have nades.

5858
03:18:40,180 --> 03:18:41,560
I'm gonna get him with this next one.

5859
03:18:42,280 --> 03:18:44,420
I'm gonna look on the other side just to be sure.

5860
03:18:45,300 --> 03:18:46,300
I'm going to...

5861
03:18:46,300 --> 03:18:47,320
I'm getting fired rifle!

5862
03:18:47,420 --> 03:18:48,280
Sorry, sorry.

5863
03:18:48,280 --> 03:18:49,300
Are you okay?

5864
03:18:50,600 --> 03:18:52,460
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

5865
03:18:52,840 --> 03:18:54,220
Oh, it's the reese.

5866
03:18:57,900 --> 03:18:59,800
I don't have an angle with you.

5867
03:19:00,540 --> 03:19:01,020
What?

5868
03:19:01,180 --> 03:19:02,080
We're not in zone.

5869
03:19:02,660 --> 03:19:04,000
Yeah, we're not in zone.

5870
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:04,580
They were right.

5871
03:19:07,180 --> 03:19:10,120
I think they got a knock because they put down a mobi rez.

5872
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:11,240
They put down a mobi rez.

5873
03:19:12,100 --> 03:19:12,600
I think the team is trying to move.

5874
03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:14,780
I think no one is in the first floor of this.

5875
03:19:14,940 --> 03:19:16,620
Yeah, I see it.

5876
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:18,140
Come to me, come to me.

5877
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:21,780
Fuck, that team is watching.

5878
03:19:22,400 --> 03:19:23,700
We gotta fight someone.

5879
03:19:23,720 --> 03:19:23,920
Stay here.

5880
03:19:27,120 --> 03:19:28,180
We're getting shot from here.

5881
03:19:30,440 --> 03:19:32,220
We have to get to the first floor of this building.

5882
03:19:32,340 --> 03:19:33,180
There's only one team.

5883
03:19:33,480 --> 03:19:34,280
This guy here cracked.

5884
03:19:36,140 --> 03:19:37,080
I knocked him, I knocked him.

5885
03:19:37,180 --> 03:19:38,600
Try to kill this team.

5886
03:19:38,600 --> 03:19:38,960
Okay.

5887
03:19:40,060 --> 03:19:40,800
Kill this team.

5888
03:19:43,840 --> 03:19:44,900
I don't know where this team is.

5889
03:19:44,960 --> 03:19:45,440
I got a shot right here.

5890
03:19:45,900 --> 03:19:46,520
Behind here.

5891
03:19:46,700 --> 03:19:48,660
On top, on top, on top.

5892
03:19:50,500 --> 03:19:51,700
I'm banging ult to them back.

5893
03:19:51,860 --> 03:19:52,420
I have ult here.

5894
03:19:54,180 --> 03:19:55,680
Oh, it's good.

5895
03:19:56,920 --> 03:19:57,560
I'm a waller.

5896
03:19:58,320 --> 03:19:59,320
I'm rezzing, I'm rezzing.

5897
03:19:59,620 --> 03:20:00,300
Go for the rez.

5898
03:20:02,400 --> 03:20:03,640
My ult didn't hit anybody.

5899
03:20:04,460 --> 03:20:05,740
You're good, you're good.

5900
03:20:05,740 --> 03:20:06,160
I'm batting.

5901
03:20:07,100 --> 03:20:09,680
We're gonna zip to the first floor of the building that's inside the zone.

5902
03:20:09,820 --> 03:20:10,660
Okay, wait, where are you?

5903
03:20:13,420 --> 03:20:14,280
I'm on wall, cool down.

5904
03:20:15,880 --> 03:20:16,760
This guy's gonna move.

5905
03:20:17,980 --> 03:20:18,540
That's pretty good.

5906
03:20:19,060 --> 03:20:22,000
You're gonna smoke the second floor and we're gonna zip in the first floor, okay?

5907
03:20:22,340 --> 03:20:22,960
Where's the second floor?

5908
03:20:23,540 --> 03:20:23,840
Right here.

5909
03:20:26,040 --> 03:20:27,200
Smoke that, smoke that, smoke that.

5910
03:20:28,560 --> 03:20:29,320
I'm gonna break the fence.

5911
03:20:29,440 --> 03:20:29,920
I'm gonna break the fence.

5912
03:20:32,220 --> 03:20:33,020
Go, go, go, go.

5913
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:33,640
Just go first floor.

5914
03:20:35,800 --> 03:20:37,380
We made it, we made it, we made it, we made it.

5915
03:20:38,500 --> 03:20:40,640
Oh, we made it, we still made it, we still made it.

5916
03:20:40,700 --> 03:20:41,320
Watch the stairs, watch the stairs.

5917
03:20:41,420 --> 03:20:42,880
I'm watching the staircase, I'm watching the staircase.

5918
03:20:43,200 --> 03:20:44,340
Yep, yep, yep.

5919
03:20:46,120 --> 03:20:47,280
I'm locking this.

5920
03:20:47,800 --> 03:20:48,840
I'm watching this door.

5921
03:20:49,520 --> 03:20:51,260
Oh, they need it, they need it, they need it.

5922
03:20:52,200 --> 03:20:52,820
You're good, you're good.

5923
03:20:53,860 --> 03:20:54,320
I love it.

5924
03:20:56,200 --> 03:20:56,760
I'm batting.

5925
03:20:57,300 --> 03:20:58,220
Yeah, I'm covering you.

5926
03:20:58,520 --> 03:21:00,560
I'm watching our push.

5927
03:21:00,580 --> 03:21:01,780
I'm on max wall, cool down.

5928
03:21:03,440 --> 03:21:04,200
Okay, okay, okay.

5929
03:21:04,400 --> 03:21:04,680
Wait.

5930
03:21:05,080 --> 03:21:05,480
Oh, no.

5931
03:21:05,740 --> 03:21:06,540
There's a guy in the zone, never mind.

5932
03:21:06,600 --> 03:21:07,160
There's a guy in here.

5933
03:21:09,180 --> 03:21:11,180
Yeah, there's a guy like all the way over there.

5934
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:12,380
Oh, wait, there's fucking stairs or a zone.

5935
03:21:12,740 --> 03:21:14,520
He can peek from this edge.

5936
03:21:15,700 --> 03:21:17,760
Oh, fuck bro, we're in a pretty bad spot.

5937
03:21:18,320 --> 03:21:21,100
Wait, right there is good, but fuck me.

5938
03:21:21,260 --> 03:21:23,020
What the fuck is going on?

5939
03:21:23,020 --> 03:21:23,720
Do you guys have vortex cups?

5940
03:21:24,360 --> 03:21:26,020
I do, I do, I do, I do.

5941
03:21:26,180 --> 03:21:26,800
Wait, wait, wait.

5942
03:21:28,760 --> 03:21:31,260
I think we can set up there now.

5943
03:21:31,720 --> 03:21:32,120
Where?

5944
03:21:32,760 --> 03:21:33,420
Right there.

5945
03:21:33,840 --> 03:21:34,600
You think so?

5946
03:21:36,600 --> 03:21:37,320
Oh, alright.

5947
03:21:39,720 --> 03:21:40,380
I don't know.

5948
03:21:40,480 --> 03:21:41,960
I don't think I've ever played there.

5949
03:21:42,660 --> 03:21:43,620
Fuck it, trust me.

5950
03:21:43,700 --> 03:21:44,300
Let's go guys.

5951
03:21:44,500 --> 03:21:45,500
We're going to save our cross.

5952
03:21:46,020 --> 03:21:48,020
I'm trusting, I'm trusting, I'm trusting.

5953
03:21:48,520 --> 03:21:50,220
Play in the crates.

5954
03:21:50,240 --> 03:21:50,760
Come here, come here.

5955
03:21:50,800 --> 03:21:51,580
We're building walls.

5956
03:21:52,220 --> 03:21:53,420
We're good, we're good, we're good.

5957
03:21:54,160 --> 03:21:55,580
I'm batting, I'm batting, I'm batting.

5958
03:21:55,580 --> 03:21:57,080
We're only going to focus our south east.

5959
03:21:57,660 --> 03:21:58,640
It's fine, it's fine.

5960
03:21:58,880 --> 03:22:00,660
I'm batting, I'm batting, I trust you.

5961
03:22:00,660 --> 03:22:01,960
I can't wall for you guys.

5962
03:22:02,800 --> 03:22:03,560
You're good, you're good, you're good.

5963
03:22:03,600 --> 03:22:04,180
It's fine, it's fine.

5964
03:22:04,420 --> 03:22:04,880
I'm going, look here.

5965
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:05,900
In front of me, in front of me.

5966
03:22:06,040 --> 03:22:06,520
Oh shit.

5967
03:22:09,780 --> 03:22:10,800
I have to bat, I have to bat.

5968
03:22:11,280 --> 03:22:12,740
In front of me right here, in front of me right here.

5969
03:22:12,800 --> 03:22:13,740
There's a guy, he's in the open.

5970
03:22:15,340 --> 03:22:16,260
I see him, I see him.

5971
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:17,860
Over here, by the ring.

5972
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:20,740
He's still in the open.

5973
03:22:22,400 --> 03:22:23,540
I'm going to come put a wall for you guys.

5974
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:25,220
He got his shields off, he got his shields off.

5975
03:22:25,600 --> 03:22:26,240
He died, he died.

5976
03:22:26,240 --> 03:22:26,980
I'm on cooldown.

5977
03:22:28,360 --> 03:22:29,860
Does your pack have a helmet?

5978
03:22:30,320 --> 03:22:32,080
There's a bat, there's bats in the package.

5979
03:22:33,480 --> 03:22:34,600
Come here, come here.

5980
03:22:35,480 --> 03:22:36,580
I'm dead, I'm dead.

5981
03:22:36,920 --> 03:22:37,880
You're good, you're good, you're good.

5982
03:22:39,080 --> 03:22:41,200
We live here, we live here.

5983
03:22:41,380 --> 03:22:42,460
Oh, nevermind.

5984
03:22:44,140 --> 03:22:45,940
That side is in, that side is in.

5985
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:46,600
They're going to be chilling.

5986
03:22:48,700 --> 03:22:49,220
Come here.

5987
03:22:52,840 --> 03:22:53,900
I'm looking, I'm looking.

5988
03:22:54,080 --> 03:22:54,640
Be careful behind this.

5989
03:22:54,800 --> 03:22:55,500
Be careful behind this.

5990
03:22:56,960 --> 03:22:58,660
We need a new wall here, we need a new wall here.

5991
03:22:58,880 --> 03:22:59,440
I'm on cooldown.

5992
03:22:59,660 --> 03:23:00,440
I'm third mining, I'm third mining.

5993
03:23:02,260 --> 03:23:03,300
One shot, one shot, one shot.

5994
03:23:05,040 --> 03:23:05,380
Nice.

5995
03:23:07,160 --> 03:23:07,500
Nice, nice, nice.

5996
03:23:07,500 --> 03:23:08,640
I'm not going to get the first.

5997
03:23:11,220 --> 03:23:12,340
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

5998
03:23:12,600 --> 03:23:13,240
They're resing here.

5999
03:23:13,780 --> 03:23:14,780
Big, big, big, big.

6000
03:23:16,260 --> 03:23:17,940
Can these people top play?

6001
03:23:18,100 --> 03:23:18,640
Oh yeah, they can.

6002
03:23:19,660 --> 03:23:21,040
I'm still on cooldown on walls.

6003
03:23:23,240 --> 03:23:23,740
Okay, okay.

6004
03:23:24,380 --> 03:23:24,840
Right here.

6005
03:23:27,020 --> 03:23:28,440
I'm going to, I'm going to go out and kill this guy.

6006
03:23:28,440 --> 03:23:29,580
Rotate, rotate, rotate, in front of me!

6007
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:30,640
Got him, got him, got him.

6008
03:23:30,840 --> 03:23:32,360
Flash, flash, flash, flash!

6009
03:23:32,560 --> 03:23:33,100
Right here, right here!

6010
03:23:33,420 --> 03:23:34,560
I knocked one, I knocked one.

6011
03:23:35,880 --> 03:23:36,980
Can you break the pylon?

6012
03:23:38,260 --> 03:23:39,140
That's a big thermite.

6013
03:23:39,540 --> 03:23:41,660
Okay, I need to heal, I need to heal.

6014
03:23:42,240 --> 03:23:43,580
They're dead, they're dead, they're dead, they're dead.

6015
03:23:43,780 --> 03:23:44,340
Oh no.

6016
03:23:44,820 --> 03:23:45,600
Noooo, your Zip!

6017
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:49,040
Wait, come to me, wait, wait, wait.

6018
03:23:49,400 --> 03:23:49,940
Come back, come back.

6019
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:52,240
You're talking bad.

6020
03:23:52,340 --> 03:23:52,920
You're talking bad, you're good.

6021
03:23:53,140 --> 03:23:53,240
You're good.

6022
03:23:56,240 --> 03:23:56,940
Stay there, Doki.

6023
03:23:57,160 --> 03:23:57,720
I'm staying!

6024
03:23:57,800 --> 03:23:58,120
Are they aiming?

6025
03:23:58,660 --> 03:23:59,300
Keep shielding.

6026
03:23:59,340 --> 03:23:59,660
No!

6027
03:24:00,140 --> 03:24:00,460
No!

6028
03:24:01,200 --> 03:24:01,920
I'm so sorry.

6029
03:24:02,140 --> 03:24:02,920
There's a red right there!

6030
03:24:03,560 --> 03:24:04,300
We got top five!

6031
03:24:05,040 --> 03:24:05,760
I'm going for the red.

6032
03:24:06,260 --> 03:24:06,860
Yeah, go for it.

6033
03:24:06,900 --> 03:24:07,140
Go for it.

6034
03:24:07,140 --> 03:24:07,460
Go for it.

6035
03:24:07,660 --> 03:24:08,480
I just shoot him here.

6036
03:24:09,260 --> 03:24:09,760
Go for it.

6037
03:24:09,780 --> 03:24:10,180
Go for it.

6038
03:24:10,200 --> 03:24:11,280
It'll be so fucking cool.

6039
03:24:11,340 --> 03:24:11,940
It'll be a clip moment.

6040
03:24:12,180 --> 03:24:13,500
A clipable moment right there.

6041
03:24:13,500 --> 03:24:13,580
Watch for me.

6042
03:24:13,580 --> 03:24:13,780
Please.

6043
03:24:14,360 --> 03:24:14,680
Please!

6044
03:24:15,160 --> 03:24:16,240
We're getting Doki back.

6045
03:24:16,400 --> 03:24:17,320
This is for Bova.

6046
03:24:17,980 --> 03:24:20,040
Nice, nice, nice.

6047
03:24:20,120 --> 03:24:20,480
I cracked two.

6048
03:24:20,520 --> 03:24:20,840
I cracked two.

6049
03:24:20,900 --> 03:24:21,220
I cracked two.

6050
03:24:21,300 --> 03:24:21,840
It's for Bova!

6051
03:24:22,780 --> 03:24:23,680
Come back, Aprizi.

6052
03:24:24,020 --> 03:24:24,480

6053
03:24:24,560 --> 03:24:24,800

6054
03:24:24,900 --> 03:24:25,600
Wait, don't pick that.

6055
03:24:25,720 --> 03:24:26,020
Don't pick that.

6056
03:24:26,320 --> 03:24:26,820
You're not.

6057
03:24:26,860 --> 03:24:27,440
Just stay safe.

6058
03:24:28,200 --> 03:24:28,980
Think about the Bova!

6059
03:24:28,980 --> 03:24:29,400
Look at this.

6060
03:24:29,440 --> 03:24:29,640
Look at this.

6061
03:24:30,120 --> 03:24:31,160
This guy can climb.

6062
03:24:31,220 --> 03:24:31,740
This guy can climb.

6063
03:24:32,540 --> 03:24:32,860
Okay.

6064
03:24:32,960 --> 03:24:33,180
Fuck.

6065
03:24:33,180 --> 03:24:34,360
He got the balloon now.

6066
03:24:34,860 --> 03:24:35,500
Oh my god.

6067
03:24:36,280 --> 03:24:36,600
No.

6068
03:24:38,120 --> 03:24:38,560
I'm okay.

6069
03:24:38,580 --> 03:24:39,040
This is a bad spot.

6070
03:24:39,220 --> 03:24:39,420
Right here.

6071
03:24:39,660 --> 03:24:40,060
Full team.

6072
03:24:40,120 --> 03:24:40,440
Full team.

6073
03:24:40,700 --> 03:24:41,580
Really fucking bad.

6074
03:24:41,620 --> 03:24:42,400
Really fucking bad spot.

6075
03:24:42,820 --> 03:24:43,140
Okay.

6076
03:24:43,280 --> 03:24:44,720
This guy to our left though can group us.

6077
03:24:44,820 --> 03:24:46,060
Yeah, lifehack, lifehack, lifehack.

6078
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:46,820
Be careful of this team left.

6079
03:24:49,240 --> 03:24:49,900
Knock another one.

6080
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:51,100
Be careful of this team left.

6081
03:24:55,200 --> 03:24:56,200
I don't know where they are.

6082
03:24:56,640 --> 03:24:57,760
I don't know where this left team went.

6083
03:24:58,560 --> 03:24:59,100
Right here.

6084
03:24:59,320 --> 03:24:59,620
Behind you.

6085
03:24:59,700 --> 03:25:00,360
This last team.

6086
03:25:01,360 --> 03:25:02,100
This last team.

6087
03:25:02,220 --> 03:25:03,320
Wait, I might...

6088
03:25:03,320 --> 03:25:03,920
Wait, it is.

6089
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:04,060
It is.

6090
03:25:05,780 --> 03:25:06,340
He's red.

6091
03:25:06,420 --> 03:25:07,100
He's red armor.

6092
03:25:09,040 --> 03:25:09,360

6093
03:25:09,560 --> 03:25:09,880

Bangled.

6096
03:25:10,940 --> 03:25:11,180
Be careful.

6097
03:25:11,420 --> 03:25:11,900
He killed one.

6098
03:25:11,960 --> 03:25:12,400
He killed one.

6099
03:25:12,400 --> 03:25:12,880
He killed one.

6100
03:25:12,880 --> 03:25:13,380
He killed one.

6101
03:25:13,380 --> 03:25:13,600
Right here.

6102
03:25:13,660 --> 03:25:13,920
Nice.

6103
03:25:13,920 --> 03:25:14,220

No, no.

6112
03:25:17,120 --> 03:25:17,600
Up, down.

6113
03:25:17,640 --> 03:25:17,860
He is on top.

6114
03:25:18,860 --> 03:25:19,380
He's on high.

6115
03:25:19,520 --> 03:25:19,800
He's on high.

6116
03:25:19,940 --> 03:25:20,900
There is a fucking life line.

6117
03:25:21,140 --> 03:25:22,160
Get the fucking thirst.

6118
03:25:22,480 --> 03:25:23,220

03:29:02,100 --> 03:29:02,720
GG's guys!

6240
03:29:02,760 --> 03:29:04,520
The power of boba and hate!

6241
03:29:04,920 --> 03:29:05,700
Yeah yeah!

6242
03:29:06,240 --> 03:29:08,020
If you really channel it in!

6243
03:29:08,400 --> 03:29:09,720
Yeah yeah yeah!

6244
03:29:09,820 --> 03:29:10,640
There was no karma!

6245
03:29:10,760 --> 03:29:11,740
Remember when we...

6246
03:29:11,740 --> 03:29:13,260
There was no karma!

6247
03:29:15,280 --> 03:29:16,720
We're not bad people!

6248
03:29:16,940 --> 03:29:18,160
It's just how the world works!

6249
03:29:19,300 --> 03:29:20,100
That's crazy!

6250
03:29:20,880 --> 03:29:22,540
That's crazy to say!

6251
03:29:22,960 --> 03:29:26,380
You were just talking bad shit and you say we're not bad people!

6252
03:29:27,780 --> 03:29:30,500
If we're bad people we would have got punished!

6253
03:29:32,880 --> 03:29:33,840
That's crazy!

6254
03:29:34,860 --> 03:29:35,760
GG's guys!

6255
03:29:35,920 --> 03:29:36,780
That was fun!

6256
03:29:36,820 --> 03:29:42,300
I hope to see you guys again in the future!

6257
03:29:43,360 --> 03:29:44,100
Bye bye!

6258
03:29:44,780 --> 03:29:45,520
Bye bye!

6259
03:29:45,700 --> 03:29:46,040
Bye bye!

6260
03:29:46,840 --> 03:29:47,860
Oh my!

6261
03:29:47,980 --> 03:29:49,060
That was so fun!

6262
03:29:49,500 --> 03:29:55,380
I can't believe we won that game!

6263
03:29:55,800 --> 03:29:57,700
That was actually crazy!

6264
03:29:58,440 --> 03:29:59,360
I did not...

6265
03:29:59,360 --> 03:30:01,940
Bro the guy I shot died a ring!

6266
03:30:02,240 --> 03:30:03,640
Out of all chances!

6267
03:30:04,080 --> 03:30:06,120
I was like bro he died a ring?

6268
03:30:06,620 --> 03:30:11,700
I looked at it and I was like I got a knock and it was last ring and we won!

6269
03:30:11,860 --> 03:30:14,260
He died a fucking ring?

6270
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:16,540
Holy shit!

6271
03:30:16,840 --> 03:30:19,320
That was actually fucking crazy!

6272
03:30:19,580 --> 03:30:20,740
That was so fun though!

6273
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:24,720
That definitely was incredibly fun!

6274
03:30:24,900 --> 03:30:25,380
I'm glad...

6275
03:30:25,380 --> 03:30:30,200
It took me a while to get started socializing but um...

6276
03:30:30,760 --> 03:30:33,600
By the time we hit game 3 we were back in our groove!

6277
03:30:33,820 --> 03:30:35,140
I told you!

6278
03:30:35,240 --> 03:30:36,900
Apex is so fun when you have...

6279
03:30:36,900 --> 03:30:40,240
It's more so about who you play with and tournament stuff.

6280
03:30:40,440 --> 03:30:48,200
That's why I haven't been streaming much Apex because it's more about who I get to play with I think Apex is more about the banter and why you have some...

6281
03:30:48,200 --> 03:30:53,880
Sometimes you get sick gameplay footage too but the banter is so fun!

6282
03:30:54,360 --> 03:30:54,780
Um...

6283
03:30:55,560 --> 03:30:56,000
Guys!

6284
03:30:56,360 --> 03:30:58,440
We added more money to the tempo bank!

6285
03:30:58,600 --> 03:30:59,040
Guys!

6286
03:30:59,420 --> 03:30:59,860
Yeah!

6287
03:31:04,920 --> 03:31:05,560
Another...

6288
03:31:05,560 --> 03:31:09,760
Another drop of tournament money in the tempo bank!

6289
03:31:10,240 --> 03:31:10,780
Um...

6290
03:31:11,380 --> 03:31:12,900
Alright let me go to...

6291
03:31:12,900 --> 03:31:15,060
Let me go to Yi-Ha time...

6292
03:31:15,060 --> 03:31:15,840
Oh shit!

6293
03:31:15,940 --> 03:31:16,520
Sorry guys!

6294
03:31:16,800 --> 03:31:17,920
We were...

6295
03:31:19,520 --> 03:31:20,160
Um...

6296
03:31:20,900 --> 03:31:24,960
We were talking about behind the scenes stuff but we're back now!

6297
03:31:25,260 --> 03:31:29,500
I'm gonna boost up the BGM a little bit while I was watching back...

6298
03:31:29,500 --> 03:31:29,780
But yeah!

6299
03:31:30,540 --> 03:31:31,520
I'm so happy!

6300
03:31:31,660 --> 03:31:32,540
I'm so happy with my team!

6301
03:31:32,720 --> 03:31:36,200
I hope you guys had a great time watching too because we haven't played Apex in a while.

6302
03:31:36,620 --> 03:31:36,960

03:32:46,520 --> 03:32:46,840
I don't know.

6344
03:32:46,920 --> 03:32:47,820
