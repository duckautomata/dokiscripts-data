And, you know, my face is in the picture too, Dark Knights.

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,260

95
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580

97
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,560
All right.

98
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,620

able to grab another photo and no no no no no no no no no no

It's okay.

121
00:19:50,520 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm pretty sure after I like we've I've calmly explained to

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,580
All right, what does the photo look like sir

You didn't even take a picture of my bark that who the fuck

125
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,940
Also, also this is in our appropriate, sir.

126
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,220

127
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,740
Sir, I...

128
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,300

130
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,040
You're so lucky.

131
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm not going to report you right now.

132
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,840
We are late for a concert.

133
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,260
You're very lucky that I won't report you.

134
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,220
But also, where the fuck did this bird came from?

135
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,260
Where's my...

136
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,140
You didn't even include my bark knight.

137
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,120
You didn't even include my little dog.

138
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,680
Where is he?

139
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,400
All right.

140
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,560
At this point, I feel like we deserve like five free photos
at this point.

141
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:05,920
Anyway.

142
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,040

145
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,660

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,040
I'm going to pick you up this time.

152
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,540
And it'll be.

153
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,160
I'm going to.

154
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,060
I'm gonna pick you up this time, okay?

155
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:31,300
And then, and then this time, this time, there's no other
yellow bird that's gonna crash this photo, all right, that's

156
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,940
not gonna photo bomb this photo.

157
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,180
So are you ready?

158
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,120

All right, how many photos has this been?

163
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,440
I've already lost count.

164
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,080
No, sir, you are not charging us for four photos.

165
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,060
Like, all four of them are unusable.

166
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,460

How was I supposed to know?

209
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,990
I booked this ticket a year ago.

210
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,990
How was I supposed to know?

211
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,410
Anyway.

212
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,950
Anyway, guys.

213
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:18,930
All right.

214
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,470
All right.

215
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,490
Are you guys all ready?

216
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,550
Are you ready for the photo?

217
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,390
Bark night?

218
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:25,910
Don't worry.

219
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,510
I don't think there's any more yellow birds that's gonna
party crash us.

220
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,750
So we'll be fine.

221
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,070
No worry.

222
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,790
As long as you, as long as you're like in frame, we should
be good to go.

223
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,150
Alright, remember, stand to my right, okay?

224
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,670
You should be bigger.

225
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,750
Like, I don't think we already kicked out the other yellow
birds.

226
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,330
I think that was the last one, right?

227
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,550
But there was a long one.

228
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,810
There was, uh, there was an egg.

229
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,790
And there was like a tiny, tiny little bird.

230
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,010
And I think, That's all of them, right?

231
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,950
I'm pretty sure.

232
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,410
I don't think that's all of those yellow birds over there.

233
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,890
All right.

234
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,310
I wonder where their owner is.

235
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,190
I wonder where their parents are, too.

236
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,690
Like, they're just looting here.

237
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,790
I feel like someone's got to, you know, take care of that
problem.

238
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,510
All right.

239
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,570
Are you guys ready?

240
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:13,530
All right.

241
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,950
In three, two, one.

242
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,050
All right.

243
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,650

like 20 photos back there.

337
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:19,830
Um, I don't know if you noticed, but I didn't even pay for
any of the photos.

338
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,330
You did not know.

339
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,030

so I guess I had no idea um I was so nervous going into this

530
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:08,280
okay before before okay before I start yapping and getting
emotional i want to show you guys this background look at

531
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:15,700
this oh sorry i'm gonna hide you guys real quick it's gonna
be animated it's gonna be animated later but uh obviously uh

532
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:27,780
uh we didn't have we didn't have time um to uh to have this
animated but like i worked with a new background artist for

533
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:35,280
this i'm so happy to find this background is because oh my
god this looks so good um but it hasn't animated yet but it

534
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:42,720
will be in the future but you guys like all the little
easter eggs uh i uh i asked alette to help out as well to

535
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:50,380
figure out some easter eggs but uh i was also brainstormed a
lot of little easter eggs uh to make this feel uh like very

536
01:02:50,380 --> 01:03:01,300
me so you see there's like all the posters on the right and
on the left side and then finally doki eats is finally real

537
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:14,700
and then uh the little pork bun stall i was like i must have
a pork bun stall at the corner and then dad's little dog

538
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:25,340
shirt stall as well his little fucking dog shirt stall we
have too many dog shirts we need to get rid of them um so

539
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:35,700
he's out there busking right now he's out there being a
businessman um um and uh the inspiration for this I think

540
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:45,980
you guys can tell uh that the inspiration for this was uh um
the Hong Kong alleyway slash market uh markets um this is

541
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:51,980
why I gave the artist and I sent him a lot of reference
pictures as well and also the chat I was like very inspired

542
01:03:51,980 --> 01:04:00,640
by like um China slash Hong Kong neon signs that you see
late at night through when you're walking through like the

543
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:08,140
blocks of the streets of Hong Kong or like the streets of
China that's what the that's what the chat was inspired by

544
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:17,120
it same with the same with the background as well like I
really wanted I thought I would fit the best yeah yeah fit

545
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:24,160
the best with the aesthetic that was going for like you know
post-concert we go we go to the to Hong Kong streets for

546
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,480
some Hong Kong street food.

547
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,320
This was exactly what I wanted to.

548
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:33,500
I was very detailed and specific on how I wanted like the
tables and the restaurants to look like.

549
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,340
So you can see the chairs.

550
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:46,100
If you ever looked up like Hong Kong street restaurants,
they use, they always use those square plastic chairs where

551
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:57,140
you can statin and then the circle wood, the circular wooden
tables and then the chopsticks with the square plastic

552
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,140
chairs and everything.

553
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:06,340
I was very specific on every little detail for this
background on how I just wanted it to, like, feel, like,

554
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:11,860
give you, like, nostalgic feeling of the streets of Hong
Kong.

555
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:16,420
And I'm glad that, like, I'm really happy with how this
turned out.

556
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:20,560
Yeah.

557
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:24,360
Yeah, the classic, like, square plastic.

558
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:34,560
white soles uh yeah that's the vibe i was going for and i'm
really happy with how it turned out um also um i hope you

559
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:41,560
guys liked i wanted to get like super creative uh with um
there's a lot of stuff i wanted to show you guys so

like what do I want to do for my anniversary you know I was

562
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:11,600
just like oh what do I do for my anniversary what I've been
streaming for so even though it's my second year anniversary

anniversary streams a lot of birthday streams and like the

564
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:30,600
hardest part is always trying to think of like what do I do
next yeah for next year what what can I do uh for my next

565
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:41,820
anniversary or like my next milestone and I actually I
talked about this before but um oh yeah let me put up let me

566
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:56,880

here buy my merch too while i talk buy my merch and um i got

567
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:07,480
this idea um a month and a half ago i didn't plan this in
advance because like i can only go like one project at a

568
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:14,800
time um it's very i uh because like i said now that i'm
indie i've been much more busy behind the scenes with a lot

569
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:20,400
of stuff going on um so if i want whenever i want to do like
personal projects and stuff like that streams and everything

570
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,920
I actually do it one at a time nowadays in the past I was
able to multitask several things at the same time but uh now

571
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:39,700
that I'm an indie um I uh I have less I guess like less of
me to to spread around so so all of the stuff that I've done

572
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:45,620
for this stream in particular uh organizing everything a
huge shout out to all the people I've commissioned uh to

573
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:54,280
make this possible let me pull up the credits real quick um
like I said they made all of this in uh within a month and a

574
01:07:54,280 --> 01:08:02,180
half so i had this idea a month and a half ago at the moment
new year's the new year stream ended uh the new year stream

575
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:09,320
ended i went straight into the anniversary planning being
like what the fuck do i am i gonna do what am i gonna do for

576
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:21,400
the anniversary so i went straight into this um coming up
with everything i wanted to do and uh everyone on this list,

577
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:27,180
so 3D animation, the, I want to actually add, like, they
actually finished the animation.

578
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:34,900
The animation and the music video, and even, like, the
rigging, all of it was done today, like, fully finalized

579
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,040
everything, done today.

580
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:41,500
I think the one thing that was finished early was the
background.

581
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:48,740
The background itself was the only one that was finished
early.

582
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,440
Oh, and the teaser and the debut teaser.

583
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,680
So huge shout out to everyone for working so hard.

584
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,140
I'm making it in time.

585
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:58,840
But yes, there's 3D animation.

586
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,800
You might recognize them.

587
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:06,100
There is a team that I usually, the team I always, I usually
work with for stuff like this, especially for events.

588
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,040
And 3D animation.

589
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:15,840
I wanted to add more to it, but we were at this point where
we actually were like, we finished the animation today.

590
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,140
But originally in my head, I wanted an ending to it.

591
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:26,740
like at the end of the cell you passing out um it's like you
guys uh there will be a small animation at the end where

592
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:32,380
like you guys get home and you're tired and you fall asleep
and then you wake up back as a dragoon and that's how i

593
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:37,880
wanted like originally in my head that's how i wanted to end
it at that time like um there wasn't enough time so i felt

594
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,840
like you know the one where after the concert i was like are
you guys okay wake up whoa you guys you guys look like

595
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:51,620
you're about to pass So, you know, I was like, that's how
I'm going to end the story.

596
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:03,900
And then sound design was Mr. Fox, background artist,
Volkiri, Puscia, to them.

597
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,420
I was just browsing my Twitter.

598
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,240
I think you guys might notice I follow a lot of artists on
Twitter.

599
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,720
Like, 90% of the people I follow in my following thing are
artists.

600
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:28,060
is literally just artwork mostly artwork memes and fortnite
uh and sometimes rivals it's memes art fortnite skins and

601
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:37,980
then sometimes rivals um so i i get a lot of like artist
recommendations so um i'm so happy that the twitter

602
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:46,240
algorithm graced me with uh valkyrie for the backgrounders
because like this background looks fucking amazing there's

603
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:54,420
so much personality to it i cannot wait to see this animated
too um i love like like they've never really been they've

604
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:01,460

either like they've done like art commissions um but they've

605
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:11,080
never done like background commissions for i think i was
like their first back like vtuber commission um so um huge

606
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:17,120

them for making me sound good and not terrible.

660
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:51,240
I really appreciate it, that I do not sound like a dying
cat, like, in my raw recordings.

661
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:57,780
so huge shout out to them for making me sound um sound like
you know actually listenable

662
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:12,440
i was very very nervous about the cover um because um i need
you guys to know i recorded this i recorded the song two

663
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:22,780
weeks ago um the mv was being made for an entire month and a
half but like the song itself was recorded two weeks ago

664
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:33,640
because if you guys don't remember I got sick in the
beginning of January I was planning on recording that like

665
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:41,900
in the first week of January um when before I got sick and
then when I got sick I was like okay that's all right as

666
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:48,460
long as I don't get the usual lingering cough um it should
be fine because I can just record after I'm not sick and

667
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:59,840
then and then as we all know that that happened i i got the
lingering cough and i still do i was coughing in the morning

668
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:10,840
when i woke up and um i was like that's okay maybe the cough
is just like two to three days you know like but but it

669
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:18,000
wasn't two to three days guys i think it's been a month now
and i was like oh that's all right maybe let's just I'll

670
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:28,220
just wait a week and then it'll go awake And then it'll go
away And that week went by And it didn't go away So I was

671
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:36,960
like Alright maybe two weeks you know Maybe two weeks I
still have time And then at that point After two weeks I was

672
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:45,340
like Fuck I actually really need to record this song So at
least like they need time To salvage whatever the fuck this

673
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:51,260
is And it always happens.

674
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:56,060
Every time I want to record a song, I get sick.

675
01:19:56,180 --> 01:20:05,160
I swear to God, 90% of the songs I've released or sang or,
like, recorded, I got sick before recording.

676
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:09,000
And, like, it's like God's way of being like, you should
stop singing.

677
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,680
You were not meant to sing.

678
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,940
Why do you keep singing after I keep getting you sick?

679
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:27,700
I feel like it's like life telling me something but anyway
um I was actually I was still coughing yeah that was me

680
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:34,440
nerfed by the way I was still coughing while I was recording
that song I picked a day where I woke up and I was like I'm

681
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:44,200
not I'm not coughing as much I I I made a lot I made hot tea
honey and honey and water um and then chugged that down and

682
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:54,880
then made another bottle of water hot water and then had the
mapego the like the the chinese herbal medicine for your

683
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:05,080
throat had that too and then got like sucked on a cough drop
to make sure and then i went to recording i tried everything

684
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:13,640
i was like all right if i'm still sick or pee pie pie pie go
sorry that's what it's called and i was like at that point i

685
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:20,920
gave up i was like okay i'm still I'm still sick, but like
we'll make do with what we have

686
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:34,100
We'll just we'll just fuck it we'll just roll with this Um,
so you shouted them I was very I I was really nervous about

687
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:41,900
that song because like I said I was I recorded it when I was
still very sick and I still am very sick Um, um, so they

688
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:49,140
were able to make it sound like a real song and I really
appreciate uh the i really appreciate that they were able to

689
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:59,680
do this um also another huge shout out to the mv artwork and
the mv on mica and raring uh for the artwork of the music

690
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:06,380
video as well as the visuals the video edits um you know how
that we had the little concert here i'll show you guys like

691
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:20,980
uh we had this and this um this literally i had this idea
well i had this idea like five hours before the stream but

692
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:31,200
then um the editor went to sleep went to bed so then um they
woke up an hour before the stream and exported um the videos

693
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:36,800
of this the looping videos of this so huge shout out to them
because i had this idea literally five hours before the

694
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:42,580
stream i was like oh my god because i didn't want to i
didn't want to

695
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:46,960
do I transition?

696
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:53,980
I was like thinking for a very long time, I was like, how do
I transition to the music video?

697
01:22:54,320 --> 01:23:00,660
And then my like this idea popped up because I remembered,
oh wait, like we have the scene from the music video, you

698
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:06,120
know, like this part from the music video with everybody
like cheering in the background and like the concert hall

699
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:06,620
and everything.

700
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:07,920
And I remember this in the video.

701
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:17,080
So I was just like, oh my gosh, okay, wait, if I have this,
I can use that as a transition transition to the concert

702
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:17,420
part.

703
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:24,600
And then I was like, how do I lead you to the MV?

704
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,120
So I was like, oh, wait, what if we just have this screen?

705
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,620
Because I didn't want to end stream and then like raid
the...

706
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,580
I didn't want to make two anniversary streams.

707
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:38,260
I figured it'd be better if I just have the premiere playing
while like this stream was going on.

708
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,800
And then we have like this little thing.

764
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:25,370

i can do it as a like part of my face so i can be like or or
as a toggle

766
01:28:54,930 --> 01:29:05,710
by the way originally this tongue was very long it was like
all the way to the bottom of my chin and i was like claire i

767
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:09,490
think you gotta make that shorter i i don't think that's
appropriate i

768
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:26,910
i was like claire i don't think that's appropriate i think i
might need that tongue a little Jordan so she cut it in half

769
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:38,550
yeah it was a little it was a two a little bit too freaky so
I had to I had to nerf the power I had to nerf the power

770
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:48,070
level oh oh yeah so I oops I really want to show you guys
this because I thought it was really funny so um for those

771
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:57,990
um who've never seen who never uh i'll show you guys like an
inside look of manufacturing and uh working with

772
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:06,430
manufacturers and stuff because um for those who've never
worked with manufacturers um it's a lot especially for

773
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:15,070
plushies it's a lot of trial and error and a lot of back and
forth and i must show you the very first iteration of this

774
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:15,910
plushie.

775
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:21,630
I shall show you a little behind the scenes on how we got
here.

776
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,590
Like, all right, so this was how the plush ended up.

777
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:28,650
I'll show you guys what the plush looks like now and then
like the comparison between the two.

778
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:29,390
I think it was this.

779
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:32,430
So, oh, this is with the cape.

780
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:42,290
So, um, it is currently at a pre-order period, but I knew,
uh, my manager, wait, is he still awake?

781
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,290
He said, he's still awake.

782
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:43,930
Manager!

783
01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:53,110
manager how long is pre-order period manager all right this
is actually not the finished version by the way but like

784
01:30:53,110 --> 01:31:01,250
this is our newest sample that we have received from our
manufacturer so uh from the so but i'll show you the very

785
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:04,370
first sample we've ever got um because it's

786
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:17,160
i'll show you the adventure of mini doki i'll show you the
adventures of little doki and how she got here how she came

787
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:26,480
to be um and she's not even finished by the way so this was
the very first draft that we received from the manufacturer

788
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:40,040
this is the very first concept we got and you're like oh
that's the first draft surely it would get better right um

789
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,700
and then this was the second one

790
01:31:51,130 --> 01:32:07,330
we got because we're like this doesn't look very right and
then why didn't you stick with this one okay oh no my god um

791
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:17,510
so then i was we were like okay this sort of doesn't look
right um um

792
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:31,930
yeah but how long is the pre-order period or is the
pre-order period until uh how long is it yeah and then and

793
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:40,750
then we're like oh man this sort of something off about this
get this dokey there's something wrong with this dokey

794
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:53,010
anyway so after that this was finally this was a the this
was the third version um you're like oh hey she looks normal

795
01:32:53,010 --> 01:33:04,850
and then you realize how wide the hair the back of the hair
is it's like i went fucking super saiyan i'm like

796
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:19,570
wow it's a super super saiyan dokey also uh my manager just
told me it's a one month order period uh one month order

797
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:27,270
period uh for the anniversary merch And Super Saiyan 3,
Doki.

798
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:28,050
Yeah.

799
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:32,590
So we're like, yeah, I think the hair needs to be a little
shorter.

800
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:34,250
And now we're here.

801
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:37,390
Now this is Doki number 4.

802
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:41,010
Please also release the first draft.

803
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:42,970
You mean this one?

804
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:45,770
He doesn't even have clothes on.

805
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:52,730
This is like not even Doki Beta.

806
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:56,750
Doki Alpha 0.01

807
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:13,870
So that is Doki, the very first Doki Plush that led to the
second to release the original Doki.

808
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:15,950
Leave her out loud.

809
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:20,310
That's the point.

810
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:21,750
Doki Prime.

811
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:23,530
Release Doki Plush.

812
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:36,770
prime it's not even dead this time it's like a fucking ditto
trying to attempt to copy me alright anyway if I don't know

813
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:46,170
if I'd call her alpha alright other than that we also have
this is something I'm also very excited about also yes if

814
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:53,530
you guys can see from this the vase will be changing to
number three so say goodbye to her nose because we will be

815
01:34:53,550 --> 01:35:00,850
removing her nose and then the face will be the third number
three uh i believe this is three right this is the one you

816
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:11,510
guys all vote for right left to right one two three and
three is this right free do toky toky has achieved god for

817
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:23,470
the first toky to step on lad is this toky three so it's
going to look like this the face will look like this in the

818
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:25,850
for those who are wondering.

819
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:27,830
No, they got her.

820
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:28,870
We deleted her nose.

821
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:30,510
She don't need to smell anything.

822
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:33,410
Smelling doesn't benefit anyone.

823
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:36,250
Like, what's the point with having a nose?

824
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:39,070
What does having a nose do for us anyway?

825
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:41,290
Like, who needs to actually smell things?

826
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:44,190
Anyway, anyway.

827
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:51,890
So this is not the final draft, and we will have Doki number
five.

828
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:54,770
And Doki number 5 will most likely look like this.

829
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:57,910
But yeah, that was the process.

830
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:01,390
A little behind the scenes look of...

831
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:03,950
How do I word this?

832
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:07,170
A little behind the scenes look on the process of Mini Doki.

833
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:12,890
Other than that, another thing I'm super excited about to
show you guys is...

834
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:14,870
The Doki coin!

835
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:15,470
Yeah!

836
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:18,610
It's finally real!

837
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:21,450
I can't endorse by the Doki bank.

838
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,810
Yes, my NFT is finally real.

839
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:25,190
It's minted and everything.

840
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:29,330
My dokey coin.

841
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:34,130
My, my Bitcoin.

842
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:40,290
To the moon.

843
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:41,570
We go.

844
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:43,690
It's real.

845
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:49,490
My cryptocurrency is finally real.

846
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:57,830
But other than that, another thing, my favorite thing about
this uh about the doki coin is that it has a back print by

847
01:36:57,830 --> 01:37:05,030
the way it doesn't not not only does it have uh a front side
but um it also has a it has a heads and a tail so it's not

848
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:12,890
just you know it's just not just me on the back side um is
also a drag is like uh uh our dragons i don't know let me

849
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:21,390
see if the store has it yeah so you can see it in the you
can see it on the listing itself, but it has a back and a

850
01:37:21,390 --> 01:37:21,990
front print.

851
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:27,790
And I think my favorite part about, all right, let me, I'll
grab the images real quick.

852
01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:30,590
Let's see.

853
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:33,430
All right, I'm refreshing.

854
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:34,750
Here, this is what it looks like.

855
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:37,470
Yeah, this is the backside of the coin.

856
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:40,030
So there is a heads and a tails.

857
01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:51,570
And my favorite part about the Goki coin is the box, which i
designed myself guys like this has my full uh the box was uh

858
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:56,630
designed entirely by me and i worked very hard on it

859
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:15,780
i worked incredibly hard on the box design guys uh i
specifically requested that we use comic sounds um as the

860
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:16,920
subtitles uh

861
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:34,360
um all right let me but yeah i am very excited about my
anniversary merch um uh i was uh uh it's something i've

862
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:39,020
always wanted to do like the merch is very personalized and
everything like a lot of stuff that i've always wanted to do

863
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:44,340
for my merch and stuff like no more no more dog shirts this
time like these are things that i know you guys actually

864
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:52,640
would what oh yeah also i Clea had time to make an
illustration for us.

865
01:38:52,940 --> 01:39:00,780
So there's going to be an acrylic block illustrated by my
mama slash papa, Clea, my OG mama papa.

866
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,760
And she made this wonderful, beautiful artwork.

867
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:05,700
And it's going to be an acrylic block.

868
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:06,840
So it's a 3D.

869
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:10,760
There's like, what's the word?

870
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:13,000
Like a 3D look to it.

871
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:18,560
Everything like that in the front, me in the middle, and
then the background in the back and everything.

872
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:29,440
And also, if you buy the entire set, you buy the entire set,
you'll get a free postcard, a free postcard, and it will, it

873
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:37,600
won't be signed, but it will have, yeah, Laird, sorry, it's
Laird, so, sorry, I'm tired, I, leading up to this

874
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:46,780
anniversary, my brain is tired, but it will be a forward
print with a special little message, a special little

875
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:50,780
message, that personally hand-written.

876
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,560
And it will be a foil print on the postcard.

877
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:55,200
If you buy the entire set.

878
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:57,380
I think it's really cute that...

879
01:39:57,380 --> 01:39:58,560
Like, I've always wanted to have, like, little...

880
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,220
I'm glad we were able to do the little capes thing, too.

881
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:04,460
The little cape with Dad and the Dragoons.

882
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:07,280
So you buy the set, you get this cheaper as well.

883
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,340
And also, like, oh, my God, look.

884
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,780
You can have all your little plushies.

885
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,900
We're Dragoon capes, too.

886
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:14,900
You can have...

887
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:18,900
Technically, you can have an army of...

888
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:24,360
Dragoons, if you think about it, you can have an army of
dragoons with your little plushies.

889
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:27,920
They can all wear, they can all wear their little capes.

890
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:31,780
And it fits the other tiny plushies.

891
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,700
If you ever like, and then you have like those mint plushies
too.

892
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,100
The capes will fit on them as well.

893
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:46,440
That's specifically designed to fit like the little, like
the little finger, like the little puppet plushies.

894
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,660
So I know they're like really popular.

895
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:55,380
in japan and in asia so you don't like own like a lot of
these little plushies and everything all the capes should

896
01:40:55,380 --> 01:41:04,300
fit them um but yeah oh my gosh i'm so happy about the merch
day my anniversary i think all of it looks amazing and

897
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:11,260
everybody worked so hard um doing all of this i had some
crazy ideas and we were able to especially for those who

898
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:20,080
don't know um usually manufacturers uh close really early
because of chinese new year so the fact that to get these

899
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:30,680
ideas out and like be able to um be able to you know make it
to this far before factories go on vacation uh for chinese

900
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:37,080
new year is like such a huge accomplishment that we were
able to show any of these progress photos for you guys um so

901
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:44,020
it's not just you know it's not just like a concept or
anything we do have samples um we do have these samples like

902
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:53,400
uh being made already uh and we're getting close to having
it done especially the plushies too um um what else what

903
01:41:53,400 --> 01:42:02,620
else did i want to tell you guys talk to you guys about
others oh yeah okay i i worked really hard on trying to make

904
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:11,660
the merch affordable for all of you guys because um um i
actually have to fight my uh the our distributor and my

905
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:20,380
manager about it about the pricing Because, like, I want to
make sure my merch is affordable for all of you guys.

906
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:26,120
Because the plushie was originally priced at, I think it was
priced at, like, $40.

907
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,740
And I was like, no!

908
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,460
It was like $35 or $40.

909
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:36,860
And I was like, I refuse to have the plushies priced that
high.

910
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:42,360
Because I was like, I was, like, researching how other
people were pricing their merch stuff and stuff.

911
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:54,560
so I like negotiated and um bargained uh with my distributor
and my manager to have it lower to $25 instead uh to make it

912
01:42:54,560 --> 01:43:01,440
more affordable for all of you guys a 25 USD um it was
originally 40 I think it was either 35 or 40 USD and I said

913
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:08,140
that was too much and I was like I like had a long
discussion with all of them and I was like it I wanted to be

914
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:15,660
$25 and um the risk for it is that we're going to be
ordering a lot of the mini plushies and they're like this is

915
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:22,520
a huge gamble are you sure and i was like yes i am sure so
if i'll be if i am selling these mini plushies for the next

916
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:33,460
three years uh that's on they're like that's on me and i oh
no it's gonna be like but it's not the dog shirt this time

917
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:45,740
it's not gonna be like the dog shirts guys it's not gonna be
like the dog marketable trust the process the mini plushies

918
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:59,600
are much more marketable than than the dog shirts like it
won't be the same um um yeah so like the coins too the coins

964
01:48:27,730 --> 01:48:38,110

merch is like one of the um no one of the number one uh is

965
01:48:38,110 --> 01:48:47,610
like i guess like one of the main sources of income for a
lot of people uh because uh merch is like a big portion of

966
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:54,130
uh of a lot of people's like a lot of streamers income
that's why a lot of people do merch and stuff so thank you

I cannot formulate sentences at the moment I keep being like
what what am I what do I want to say like I'm not locked in

972
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:33,550

973
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:40,350
But my streamer mindset is not on right now.

974
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:43,690
I'm so I'm like I'm so chill at the moment

975

use the fabric to make a little mini shirt for the doki.

1020
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:05,160
What else did I want to show?

1021
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:06,660
Oh yeah, let me check my folder.

1022
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:10,060
I downloaded a lot of stuff on my folder, so I just want to
be sure.

1023
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:12,400
There's anything else I want to show.

1024
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,460
Oh yeah, yeah, I forgot to show you guys this.

1025
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,320
This is his design.

1026
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:19,440
Did you like it?

1027
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:22,980
He doesn't have his dog tag because it ripped off his ear.

1028
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:25,280
But he has his little earrings.

1029
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:28,460
Just a bad boy.

1030
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,400
He has his little earrings.

1031
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:31,840
And his shirt says dad.

1032
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:33,420
A little notched ear.

1033
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:39,400
And then here are some concepts of the concept art of what
he could have looked like.

1034
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:53,320
yeah so uh we pivoted from the like this was what claya came
up with at first but i was like i gave like a different

1035
01:55:53,320 --> 01:56:00,020
suggestion because i wanted him to look more like a like
like more like gough punk like punk rock type deal so that's

1036
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:07,600
why we have the little spike collar and the little spike
collar and the classic like stripped t-shirt the stripped

1037
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:18,360
t-shirt with the spiky collar and and i think he looks looks
pretty rad now oh yeah also the bonus artwork from the music

1038
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:29,080
video the artist drew this like drew this in her free time
um um and then we took that idea with the polaroids and

1039
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:36,260
stuff uh she because like she drew this at first as like a
little little bonus art um it was like little bonus noodle

1040
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:40,840
and then we're like oh wait the polar idea is so funny let's
add that into the music video.

1041
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:52,920
And my favorite part was when Dragoon Doki taped her face
over the girlfriend Dragoon.

1042
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:00,420
And that's one of my favorite scenes in the music video.

1043
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:01,400
What else?

1044
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,920
What else I want to show you guys?

1045
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:19,180

actually have this i actually sort of wish i had the sample

1046
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:26,180

this doesn't look right i'm pretty sure they like

1047
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:34,880
deconstructed it and reused the fabric for another thing
like sky welcome to the tomato fire welcome will dokey prime

The missing link?

1070
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:33,190

1072
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:35,150

She's Lucy Bird!

1074
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:42,570
The first Stokey.

1075
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:43,950
She's the missing link.

1076
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:50,210
That's Lucy right there.

1077
02:00:50,790 --> 02:00:52,170

02:00:52,530 --> 02:00:53,830
primordial doki.

1079
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:57,330

Uh, this doki got wiped out uh, by, by by doki sapien.

It'll be like this.

1092
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:37,620
So the fourth stage of sampling.

1093
02:02:38,540 --> 02:02:38,840
Why?

1094
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:40,520
Now I'm going to cancel my order.

1095
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:43,720
I thought the plushie was going to look like the first one.

1096
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,080
Now I'm disappointed.

1097
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:46,020
No!

1098
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:50,960
But what if I want it to look like this?

1099
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:58,360
Doki 3, aka San Doku.

1100
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,260

1104
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:44,870

remember anything anymore I guys like a hundred million

1105
02:03:44,870 --> 02:03:51,650
things are going on at the same time right now behind the
scenes so I like I could barely remember what I can and

1106
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:58,370
can't say because like I have so many NDAs and contracts
I've signed and I'm just like am I allowed to say this now

1107
02:03:58,370 --> 02:04:05,370
like and I'm like all the dates have blurred together that I
can't on when my NDA ends.

1108
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:07,970
I can't keep track anymore.

1109
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:10,330
There's too many contracts.

1110
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:11,470
All right.

1111
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:18,130
Too many contracts.

1112
02:04:20,530 --> 02:04:21,390
All right.

1113
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:36,000
All right.

1114
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:38,720
I need a...

1115
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:40,620
No, my manager is my spreadsheet.

1116
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:43,260
Why read my own...

1117
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:45,580
Why read and make my own spreadsheet?

1118
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:52,820
If my manager is my chat GPT, I'm like, at manager, do I,
can I talk about this?

1119
02:04:54,980 --> 02:04:57,100
All right, okay, all right, I can talk about it.

1120
02:04:57,260 --> 02:05:08,380
All right, I talked to my manager PT, manager GPT, and he
said that I can say that on Monday, I was like, I didn't

1121
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:09,200

On Monday, I will, oh, shit, okay.

1123
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:20,000
On Monday, I was invited to do the early access of the
newest Apex season.

1124
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:22,520

02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:19,040
So there's a smug one.

1162
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:23,920
And then...

1163
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:24,600
Confused.

1164
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:37,490

Oh.

1167
02:10:46,690 --> 02:10:48,710

1168
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:49,210
Money.

02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:50,250
I see.

1170
02:10:54,510 --> 02:11:04,210
whoa oh my god that's a lot of money and then

1171
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:26,460
um oh yeah and this is a classic the hard hands uh in the
past as retro dokey uh because I was a very small streamer

1172
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:33,740
back then um whenever I got a follow I'll give a little hard
hand like oh thank you for the follow um here's a little

1173
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:41,440
heart so that's why i had this i had this toggle made so i
was like thanking people for every follow i got because it

1174
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:52,520
was very rare when someone follows me because i was a very
small streamer back then um and also the clap i forgot what

1175
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:58,320
was the point oh yeah for subscribing and then on because i
was on twitch too i was twitch streamer so every time when

1176
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:01,640
someone subscribed to me on Twitch, I was like, thank you
for subscribing.

1177
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:04,380
And I was like, give them a little, thank you for the sub.

1178
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:06,840
And I gave them a little clap to be like, thank you.

1179
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:07,820
And oh yeah, there's the bong.

1180
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:11,760
I had like a little redeem where you can bong me.

1181
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:13,100
I'd be like, bong.

1182
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:16,700
And then a little dancing.

1183
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:17,640
Yay.

1184
02:12:18,220 --> 02:12:19,220
Because I got lazy.

1185
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:21,800
Like, you know, like when you're like, I don't want to move
my body.

1186
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:23,280
Oh yeah, here's the glasses.

1187
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:24,620
Eh.

1188
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:38,880
activated yeah that's right and then and i could put this on
and off so like if i feel really really cool today i mean

1189
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:52,080
like oh today is so good well next scene thank you for the
akka i don't know i don't know if it overlaps but i can try

1190
02:12:52,080 --> 02:13:00,500
but thank you for the akka soup but thank you thank you
Unfortunately, I'm sorry.

1191
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:01,940
It doesn't overlap.

1192
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,560
Confuse overpowers, Dua.

1193
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:07,920
Confuse.

1194
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:10,180
Confuses the alpha.

1195
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:13,940
It's a little...

1196
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:15,800
It's so cold.

1197
02:13:16,460 --> 02:13:16,780
Wow.

1198
02:13:19,460 --> 02:13:23,080
And then this can be a toggle to him.

1199
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:23,500
And...

1200
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:26,220
Or...

1201
02:13:26,220 --> 02:13:27,760
Um...

1202
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:30,760
I wish I had a screenshot of my very long tongue.

1203
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:32,200
It was crazy.

1204
02:13:32,360 --> 02:13:33,700
I don't have the...

1205
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:35,200
I don't have the...

1206
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:37,920
The skin suit anymore.

1207
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:39,320
Maybe I could ask Clay...

1208
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:41,140
Wait, I don't know if Clay is back yet.

1209
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:43,440
Yeah, no, she's not back.

1210
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:46,500
But maybe I could show you guys in another stream.

1211
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:50,220
But, like, that tongue went all the way to my chin.

1212
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:51,640
It was fucking crazy.

1213
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:54,380
It was a very long tongue.

1214
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:56,640
And I was like, Clay, we got a short in that tongue.

1215
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:57,840
I was like, your's dad.

1216
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:06,380
here's dad here he is it's like i could almost chuck him in
the air immediately whoa making like a little pancake look

1217
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:22,570
at him he's showing his belly he's so submissive right now
look at him so submissive and then there's him uh because it

1218
02:14:22,570 --> 02:14:27,010
looked weird what do you mean why did i change it It looked
fucking weird.

1219
02:14:27,430 --> 02:14:28,530
It didn't right.

1220
02:14:28,690 --> 02:14:29,790
It didn't look right.

1221
02:14:30,650 --> 02:14:32,410
And there's him again.

1222
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:33,490
There's that again.

1223
02:14:34,490 --> 02:14:38,170
And then there's just eye bags.

1224
02:14:38,650 --> 02:14:43,050
And then when the joy leaves my body.

1225
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:51,420
When it fully, there's no more whims.

1226
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:53,460
When there's no more whimsy in the world.

1227
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:55,940
There's a little whimsy still.

1228
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:57,620
I still have hope for the world.

1229
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:00,520
Whimsy is God.

1230
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:06,660
There's...

1231
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:09,560
The whimsy is God.

1232
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:13,260
You should have thought...

1233
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:15,980
No, it was so fucking weird.

1234
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:19,620
No, when you see it, it didn't look right.

1235
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:20,580

02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:49,620
I look so cool.

1249
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:51,360
I don't look like a shut-in.

1250
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:54,840
I look like I touch grass regularly, guys.

1251
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:55,660
For real.

1252
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,280

And then the one time, I was like, oh my gosh, I know what 2

off-tune, off-key, off-tempo rendition of VeggieTales.

02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:38,360
Off lyrics.

1303
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:51,700

It's so, I don't know, it's so aesthetically pleasing.

1352
02:23:18,900 --> 02:23:20,360
I love looking at this background.

1353
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:23,680
I think I'm just super nostalgic, too.

1354
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:33,040
It really does remind me of, like, um, it really reminds me
of, like, the streets of hong kong like the local hong kong

1355
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:37,520
uh markets and streets i

1356

1357
02:23:47,010 --> 02:23:55,810

overlay like i had a little back and forth with the uh with

1358
02:23:55,810 --> 02:24:02,130
the coder um because like i i told him my inspiration was
like half cyberpunk Because, like, I don't know if you guys

1359
02:24:02,130 --> 02:24:13,430
noticed, but cyberpunk, the aesthetics and designs of
cyberpunk pulls heavily on, on, like, the streets of Hong

1360
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:16,690
Kong and China with the whole neon lights.

1361
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:22,890
If you ever seen, like, especially in China, there's, like,
if you ever seen, like, the cities in China, it really looks

1362
02:24:22,890 --> 02:24:24,070
like a cyberpunk.

1363
02:24:24,370 --> 02:24:29,450
It really looks very cyberpunk-ish, because that's where
they pull a lot of the design elements and the inspiration

1364
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:30,430
from it from.

1365
02:24:32,010 --> 02:24:42,030
So I gave them a lot of references of the streets of Hong
Kong And Like the neon signs and stuff that you see when

1366
02:24:42,030 --> 02:24:44,450
you're walking around in Hong Kong or like in China

1391
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:22,870
I'm sorry.

1392
02:27:22,950 --> 02:27:27,310
You have to remind me when you, if I don't respond in a day
or two, you have to poke me.

1393
02:27:27,590 --> 02:27:31,430
I literally get like 20 DMs every morning that's related to
work.

1394
02:27:31,690 --> 02:27:33,530
So I'm just like, I'm so sorry.

1395
02:27:34,050 --> 02:27:35,610
I'm so all over the place.

1396
02:27:36,030 --> 02:27:37,810
I'm so, but my name is Aki for the

1397
02:27:41,230 --> 02:27:50,390
you so much so i'm glad that he was able to he he fully he
finished the super chat design the design of the super chats

1398
02:27:50,390 --> 02:27:59,470
for the the code for it literally like this morning too like
he designed it and finished the code this morning because he

1399
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:05,870
because he was like waiting for my approval on like um what
i want for the super chats but everything else was done it

1400
02:28:05,870 --> 02:28:12,630
was literally just the super chat part so like the fact that
he was able to make that in like what in less than a day

1401
02:28:12,630 --> 02:28:22,550
like it's crazy yeah like I said everything literally came
together this morning and then except for the background the

1402
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:32,170
background was finished like a couple of like last week but
I do hope you guys like the reveal um I was really worried

1403
02:28:32,170 --> 02:28:41,070
about it like I said like um I've been doing this for a
while now um so it's always hard to figure out what to do

1404
02:28:41,230 --> 02:28:41,650
next.

1405
02:28:43,470 --> 02:28:47,510
That you know, it's always like, ah, how do I celebrate the
second year anniversary?

1406
02:28:47,770 --> 02:28:49,470
You know, I always like doing new things, you know.

1407
02:28:49,770 --> 02:28:56,810
I know a lot of people, they like to do, they like, they go
through the motions and stuff.

1408
02:28:56,870 --> 02:29:00,130
Like, it's very routine for them for anniversaries or
birthdays and stuff like that.

1409
02:29:00,310 --> 02:29:06,310
But for me, I love coming up with new ideas on celebrating
anniversaries or celebrating event, big events, like the

1410
02:29:06,310 --> 02:29:12,310
Unidocate and stuff, or like big, like you know birthdays
and stuff i always want to do new things and try new stuff

1411
02:29:12,310 --> 02:29:18,250
for it like you know um i've done a lot of things over the
years and even like you know like um you know my corporal

1412
02:29:18,250 --> 02:29:24,570
days i could just done redone stuff i did in corporal i
still want to have my own new touch to it a new spin to it

1413
02:29:24,570 --> 02:29:30,490
you know like how the doky line is very reminiscent of
something else i've done in the past with a 3d world but i

1414
02:29:30,490 --> 02:29:38,070
i've done like a new spin to it i made it bigger than it was
before made more had paid more attention to the detail of

1415
02:29:38,070 --> 02:29:46,110
the 3d world what i've learned in the past um and same here
for the anniversary i was like what can i do for the

1416
02:29:46,110 --> 02:29:51,450
anniversary i could just do a regular outfit reveal but i
love you know a lot of people for outfit reveals they just

1417
02:29:51,450 --> 02:29:58,410
reveal the outfit and then just that's it but i always love
being more creative in how i do outfit reveals too like a

1418
02:29:58,410 --> 02:30:06,990
little photo shoot not just like here's the feet and then
drag up i always i want to do something more creative and

1419
02:30:06,990 --> 02:30:14,010
how to showcase uh because like i feel like everyone knew
what the what the skin suit was gonna be anyway because it's

1420
02:30:14,010 --> 02:30:22,290
like very iconic you know alt doki is very retro alt doki is
very uh iconic already so like everyone sort of already

1421
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:31,410
knows what it was gonna look like i still wanted to make it
really fun and um i want to be more creative of like how i

1422
02:30:31,410 --> 02:30:39,170
go into it i always like have a little story behind the
reveal like a little like session roleplay session and like

1423
02:30:39,170 --> 02:30:46,030
a little story behind like how we get into the reveal and
stuff like that like it's not just a regular reveal like we

1424
02:30:46,030 --> 02:30:50,090
have like a beginning middle and end to it like it's like

1425
02:30:53,150 --> 02:31:05,230
the purpose on what it is what what we're revealing and um
what's funny is that little photo shoot idea was supposed to

1426
02:31:05,230 --> 02:31:13,310
be something different I was supposed to do the reveal a
different way um but I had the photo shoot assets already

1427
02:31:13,310 --> 02:31:25,210
made uh um I've already had it already made for something
else and wanted it to be like uh I wanted it to like use it

1428
02:31:25,210 --> 02:31:29,750
for something else like I was thinking of like going to a
photo booth and getting photos taken and stuff but that was

1429
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:36,750
like no this would be this would be like really fun if it
was to use as a as a skin suit reveal instead so that's I

1430
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:44,050
pivoted to that like two days ago I pivoted to it and that's
why like today I actually asked Clea to draw on the like

1431
02:31:44,050 --> 02:31:53,910
hands and stuff onto the little check the little photos as
well to make it more like you know more immersive yeah two

1432
02:31:53,910 --> 02:32:01,670
days ago I was like oh wait this idea is better I feel like
I need more like it sucks because a lot of my like a lot of

1433
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:09,490
my very creative ideas tend to come to me like last minute
I'd be like oh my god I can also do this and then like

1434
02:32:09,490 --> 02:32:14,810
literally like it would be like two to three days before I
have to do the reveal and then I just like I have like this

1435
02:32:14,810 --> 02:32:19,990
amazing creative idea and I'm like fuck okay okay we're
gonna see if I can make it work

1436
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:31,630
Justin, thank you for the super chat.

1437
02:32:31,790 --> 02:32:32,610
Yeah, no, I work back.

1438
02:32:32,690 --> 02:32:35,690
I work really well under pressure, which is not ideal.

1439
02:32:38,130 --> 02:32:45,330
It is not ideal because I sometimes have these like really
cool ideas, but then like no time to like make it happen

1440
02:32:45,330 --> 02:32:49,290
just because like, you know, I don't want to like pressure
someone.

1441
02:32:49,470 --> 02:32:51,930
I if it's like something small to make, that's fine.

1442
02:32:52,050 --> 02:32:57,650
But like the fact that I had the ending, the end like how I
was like, oh, if only I could have the three animation of

1443
02:32:57,650 --> 02:32:59,010
like an actual ending to the store.

1444
02:32:59,790 --> 02:33:07,550
main it would have been easy but then I thought of that yeah
like two to three days ago and I was like there's not enough

1445
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:12,710
time we have to get the 3D animation done first yeah

1446
02:33:18,890 --> 02:33:25,570
but what was I say Justin think of the Super Chat thank you
has it been two years already I remember the Mad Cat debut

1447
02:33:25,570 --> 02:33:29,910
I'm going to watch Tokyo's live and cheer with the last
stuff of my coffee thank you for the Super Chat thank you

1449
02:33:40,630 --> 02:33:51,010
support and for you guys for uh enabling my fun creative
stupid ideas but always i don't have done this for so long

1450
02:33:51,010 --> 02:33:59,170
but i'm always still so nervous like i've done so many of
these events so many is adversaries and the birthday streams

1451
02:33:59,170 --> 02:34:07,770
and the big event my stone streams but every time i'm always
so fucking nervous going into it because you know you don't

1452
02:34:07,770 --> 02:34:13,250
know what's gonna happen when you're live you know anything
could happen like you know like what if like you mess up on

1453
02:34:13,250 --> 02:34:17,410
something like i'm always worried like oh why don't i mess
up on something like right now my head is not in the

1454
02:34:17,410 --> 02:34:24,710
streamer mindset it's not it's like it's half half it's like
i'm way too relaxed now i'm either actually no that doesn't

1455
02:34:24,710 --> 02:34:31,410
make sense i'm like stressed but relaxed at the same time
and they're fighting each other they're like stress because

1456
02:34:31,410 --> 02:34:40,190
of what's coming up next week relax because it's over now so
i'm i'm chill now like i'm like oh i i didn't my reveal and

1457
02:34:40,190 --> 02:34:47,730
everything now i just want to talk to my dragoons um but
then like my head is like so scrambled right now like i i'm

1458
02:34:47,730 --> 02:34:56,810
like it's so hard for me to formulate like like formulate
sentences and stuff yeah post stress perfectly balanced

1459
02:35:00,470 --> 02:35:14,990
the stress calmness cyber dragon thank you for the akasupa

02:35:14,990 --> 02:35:21,930
looking forward to my vacation in march though i i'll be
taking like uh in march i'll be traveling and we'll be

1461
02:35:21,930 --> 02:35:30,690
taking like around a week a week break a week and a couple
of days break not a half apparently no week and a half maybe

1462
02:35:30,690 --> 02:35:39,470
um i don't know if i'll be streaming during like during that
vacation um like my manager actually rejected my sponsors

1463
02:35:39,470 --> 02:35:48,510
for march it was a lot of money too i was like no why did
you do that for those who weren't here on the twitch stream

1464
02:35:48,510 --> 02:35:55,630
um i talked about how um um basically i got offer two
sponsors during my vacation week and i was like you should

1465
02:35:55,630 --> 02:36:02,290
take it and then my manager would always like run it by me
and being like you want to take that sponsor or like like

1466
02:36:02,290 --> 02:36:05,470
they'll be like this is how much they're going to pay you
are you going to take that sponsor and i'll be like yes

1467
02:36:05,470 --> 02:36:13,210
usually like 99 of the chance i'd be like yes unless it's
like a game where i'm like oh i don't know um i don't know

1468
02:36:13,210 --> 02:36:20,170
if i can like make content with that but usually 99 of time
i would say yes anyway anyway i said yes and then like the

1469
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:23,670
next day he was like i rejected your And I was like, what?

1470
02:36:23,850 --> 02:36:24,790
But why?

1471
02:36:25,230 --> 02:36:31,810
I had like, on this day and that day, I could have easily
streamed on my laptop in the hotel room.

1472
02:36:32,110 --> 02:36:35,890
And he was like, he's like, Doki, you need a vacation, man.

1473
02:36:36,030 --> 02:36:39,070
I was like, but it was so much money.

1474
02:36:39,790 --> 02:36:44,250
And he was like, Doki, you're barely functioning right now.

1475
02:36:45,030 --> 02:36:47,870
It's like, Doki, you had a nervous breakdown yesterday.

1476
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:48,430
Like,

1477
02:36:52,590 --> 02:36:59,950
had a nervous breakdown yesterday because of overworked Doki
I think I think you you shouldn't you should use that

1478
02:36:59,950 --> 02:37:11,770
vacation to to actually relax I'm like but the money though
yeah I had a nervous breakdown but like but like I can just

1479
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:14,690
cry about it and the money I earn

1480
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:31,480
like but that's future Doki's problem not present Doki
problems um but anyway luckily my manager is much more

1481
02:37:31,480 --> 02:37:49,600
stable and uh yeah what I can wipe my tears with that bag
though manager I get but I could just wipe my tears with

1482
02:37:49,600 --> 02:38:10,140
that bag of money but anyway luckily my manager um is more
stable and what's the word more a sensible person is a is a

1483
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:21,780
reasonable and is an adult luckily and know my limits and he
or she made sure that I did not have any sponsors or work

1484
02:38:21,780 --> 02:38:37,240
during my vacation you're green reasonable yeah yeah and
respond yeah like he's a much more responsible person

1485
02:38:41,820 --> 02:38:53,400
very rational exactly i don't know maybe i will sneak a
stream in who knows maybe i'll be like oh hey let's talk

1486
02:38:53,400 --> 02:39:02,720
about what i was doing on my vacation or maybe i show some
that like show you guys what i did Well, not really, because

1487
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:05,120
then they'll be like, no, actually, I shouldn't do that.

1488
02:39:05,460 --> 02:39:07,860
Like, I should do that after I leave the country.

1489
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:16,320
Yes, I will be traveling overseas, but I was like thinking,
yeah, maybe I should do that after I leave the country.

1490
02:39:17,620 --> 02:39:18,060
Don't.

1491
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:20,760
Yeah.

1492
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:22,120
Work-life.

1493
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:23,160
What balance?

1494
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:24,680
There's no work-life balance.

1495
02:39:24,860 --> 02:39:25,580
It's just work.

1496
02:39:26,420 --> 02:39:29,700
It's just work and work.

1497
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:39,240
Doki cries and mighty raging Thank you for the super chat
Thank you, thank you

1498
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:55,540
Sorry my nose is stuffy Snuffier Stuffier right now There's
no snuffier It says no raccoons allowed in Dragoon Alley By

1499
02:39:55,540 --> 02:39:57,760
Doki Bird Association Law

1500
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:14,280
Yeah, it's work and Marvel rivals balance work o'clock oh
someone asked like about the upgraded assets that was my

1501
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:26,280
original assets before i started wearing uh sports bra it
was it was my original it this is what it's always was like

1502
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:40,640
i'm just not wearing a sports bra right now guys i'm freeing
the goods you gotta let them breathe sometime you know you

1503
02:40:40,640 --> 02:40:48,580
know i found out if you if okay for those uh for the for the
men out there for those who don't know um apparently

1504
02:40:48,580 --> 02:40:54,340
actually i don't know actually i don't know might be
spreading misinformation but you have to have a balance

1505
02:40:54,340 --> 02:41:01,920
between wearing your bras because if you wear your bras too
much you're destroying the elasticity of your of your bobs

1506
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:10,920
but then if you don't wear your bras enough then gravity
does its work a little fun fact a little so you have to have

1507
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:26,060
a good like balance between like bra or no bra the goods
yeah they sell sports bras for thighs yes they do That's

1508
02:41:26,060 --> 02:41:29,820
what the belts are for Thank you, the super chat Thank you,
thank you

1509
02:41:36,910 --> 02:41:45,150
They need support Yes, but if you support it too much Then
like Then it'll be like They'll like think They'll have It's

1510
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:52,530
like if you use your training reels too much You're going to
rely on it The entire time They gotta build the strength

1511
02:41:52,530 --> 02:42:00,750
They gotta be able to support itself sometimes But then if
it supports itself too much If you're independent too much,

1512
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:03,550
then gravity comes for us all.

1513
02:42:04,510 --> 02:42:07,810
It works for the boss down there, too.

1514
02:42:08,150 --> 02:42:15,450
For the men out there, you can't escape gravity as well.

1515
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:23,010
Just remember, you can't escape gravity, too.

1516
02:42:23,810 --> 02:42:28,230
No one escapes gravity.

1517
02:42:28,430 --> 02:42:28,670
you?

1518
02:42:29,410 --> 02:42:31,490
What are you saying?

1519
02:42:34,910 --> 02:42:36,950
I learned that on Twitter.

1520
02:42:37,810 --> 02:42:39,350
I didn't realize that.

1521
02:42:39,550 --> 02:42:42,530
I was like, wait, that also happens?

1522
02:42:46,550 --> 02:42:49,050
Thank you, Twitter algorithm.

1523
02:42:50,770 --> 02:42:51,670
Chat, is this real?

1524
02:42:51,830 --> 02:42:54,710
Oh, no one escapes gravity.

1525
02:42:55,450 --> 02:42:55,450
No.

1526
02:42:58,430 --> 02:43:01,810
You see, the difference is that we have bras.

1527
02:43:06,650 --> 02:43:07,670
Not even.

1528
02:43:08,010 --> 02:43:08,750
Oh, my God.

1529
02:43:09,010 --> 02:43:10,430
Wait, that reminded me.

1530
02:43:10,710 --> 02:43:11,570
Oh, my God.

1531
02:43:11,970 --> 02:43:13,310
It's about the Olympics.

1532
02:43:13,470 --> 02:43:17,110
But did you guys hear there's a new meta in skiing?

1533
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:18,870
Oh, my God.

1534
02:43:19,150 --> 02:43:21,750
So, like, apparently, chat.

1535
02:43:22,330 --> 02:43:22,850
So good.

1536
02:43:26,530 --> 02:43:29,290
That chat is this real.

1537
02:43:31,830 --> 02:43:38,230
Oh yeah, but like, okay, there's a new meta in Olympic
skiing.

1538
02:43:39,050 --> 02:43:51,730
So apparently the new controversy in the Olympics is that
they had to implement a new rule in Olympic skiing because

1539
02:43:51,730 --> 02:44:00,070
skiers were injecting acid into their PPs so that they would
expand more.

1540
02:44:00,470 --> 02:44:06,030
so that when they get fitted for their ski uniform, they
would get, like, extra material.

1541
02:44:06,490 --> 02:44:14,250
So after the acid wears off, they get, like, um, they get,
like, an X amount of extra material, and it makes it more

1542
02:44:14,250 --> 02:44:15,150
aerodynamic.

1543
02:44:19,860 --> 02:44:20,420
What?

1544
02:44:21,140 --> 02:44:21,700
Yeah!

1545
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:30,060
So, like, the Olympics had to make a statement yesterday,
being like, we have now issued a new rule regarding ski

1546
02:44:30,060 --> 02:44:30,580
jumping.

1547
02:44:30,980 --> 02:44:32,580
You're now not allowed.

1548
02:44:32,600 --> 02:44:49,020
to shoot up acid in your dicks so that you can get more
material for your uniform what the actual like I did not

1549
02:44:49,020 --> 02:45:02,580
need this knowledge so like so so the skiers can have more
aerodynamic for their ski jumps sport meta go crazy I truly

1550
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:12,640
is crazy I'm not sure I understood any of those words in
that order who the hell who the hell who the hell injected

1551
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:28,520
acid in their peepee to find out who just just use Viagra
white acid this is what you talk about in your second year

1552
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:43,220
is how I spend my holidays someone's back check this but
even if you won the gold it's not worth it maybe it's

1553
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:50,200
because there's already oh honestly i think the reason why
they didn't use biagra is because there's already a rule in

1554
02:45:50,200 --> 02:46:00,820
ski jumping about it so then the guy was like well they said
nothing about shooting acid in your peepee they found the

1555
02:46:00,820 --> 02:46:05,860
loophole they're like Well, they said nothing about acid,
though.

1556
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:10,720
Like, Jesus.

1557
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:19,460

loopholes for the Olympics?

02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:43,180
Okay.

1583
02:48:43,260 --> 02:48:49,020
okay these are like a lot of stuff I wanted to talk about
that I forgot about but like do you guys hear about the new

1584
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:58,300
character what's her name uh new phoenix of overwatch uh
onran onron or something and then someone did like uh

1585
02:48:58,300 --> 02:49:05,100
there's a new character they shadow dropped five characters
in overwatch um and one of her name one of them is her name

1586
02:49:05,100 --> 02:49:10,960
is onron and she's literally like a copy of phoenix um
because her alt is literally her alt is literally phoenix

1587
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:18,000
and I thought it was so like the funny thing is unrelated to
any of her abilities it's the fact that like she just looks

1588
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:29,000
like Juno and Kiriko and someone was like how did she get
like plastic surgery or something cuz what the fuck happened

1589
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:41,780
to her face and like someone did like a comparison of like
of like the model like expectations and reality Wait, let

1590
02:49:41,780 --> 02:49:42,580
me, I'll show it to you.

1591
02:49:42,820 --> 02:49:44,260
I was like, what the fuck?

1592
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:46,300
They, like, shaved off her nose.

1593
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:47,900
What happened to her nose?

1594
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:49,900
Where did it all go?

1595
02:49:50,020 --> 02:49:53,640
Did she get plastic surgery before she joined Overwatch?

1596
02:49:56,940 --> 02:49:57,900
That's crazy.

1597
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:59,520
I was like, what the fuck?

1598
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:01,840
Here, look at that.

1599
02:50:02,420 --> 02:50:04,060
This is not the same person.

1600
02:50:06,320 --> 02:50:07,800
Like, great fucking.

1601
02:50:08,140 --> 02:50:09,980
This is not the same person.

1602
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:10,940
Who is this?

1603
02:50:10,960 --> 02:50:15,080
like yeah

1604
02:50:19,140 --> 02:50:23,820
and then there was a gif of like her someone like putting
different types of hair

1605
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:32,340
she literally got plastic surgery before she joined
overwatch

1606
02:50:41,890 --> 02:50:55,090
that was crazy i i mean like gotta sell skins i guess like i
like when they put galacta on their next yeah in the galacta

1607
02:50:55,090 --> 02:51:08,890
area it and then the fucking toward the ball toward born got
your nose i mean to be fair to be fair like okay the only

1608
02:51:08,890 --> 02:51:18,490
issue is that she's not support though like that's the thing
look i feel like okay so for tps these are the tps

1609
02:51:18,490 --> 02:51:31,730
characters are it would be like ash and widow the most
played dps characters um that uh people buy skins for ash

1610
02:51:31,730 --> 02:51:38,670
widow and junk rat because like junk rat like there's a very
dedicated one trick community for junk rat but like i don't

1611
02:51:38,670 --> 02:51:47,810
think on onran is gonna have a very dedicated community of
dps players that's gonna play onran it would make more sense

1612
02:51:47,810 --> 02:51:56,890
if they're gonna make a copy they're gonna make a copy of
kiriko and juno it should be a support then because because

1613
02:51:56,890 --> 02:52:04,470
like because i feel like she would have sold much more skins
if she was a support player if she was a support character

1614
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:12,690
versus a dps character because people who pick like pick the
female dps characters are not like the baby face characters

1615
02:52:12,690 --> 02:52:24,530
they're like the the like oh she's so hot her looks could
kill me type shit she's like you know they're like you know

1616
02:52:24,530 --> 02:52:32,570
like like ash like ash and widow they're like oh yeah
they're the bad girls like i want to play her they're the

1617
02:52:32,570 --> 02:52:42,790
bad girl dps characters yeah you know and then and like aran
does not look like a bad bitch she does not look like she

1618
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:50,210
she looks like she looks like um she looks like this her
first day at school

1619
02:52:53,310 --> 02:53:02,390
yeah I love a woman that would just kill me yeah she looks
like I need to hold her hand and tell her where the point is

1620
02:53:02,390 --> 02:53:07,050
and be like that's the point Arran please please go there

1621
02:53:15,060 --> 02:53:25,840
so I feel like a lot of people I feel like a lot of I feel
like she won't have as many people buying her skins compared

1622
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:33,660
to like like the other characters next see they give the
super chat thank you thank you does this mean alt girl doki

1623
02:53:33,660 --> 02:53:42,720
is a support to bounty hunter doki's dps i think i can
actually make a 6v6 hero shooter game out of doki's um alt

1624
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:48,980
doki would be support um dokefield will be tank

1625
02:53:52,940 --> 02:53:53,980
will be DPS.

1626
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:59,380
Alright, who would be the other support character?

1627
02:54:00,020 --> 02:54:01,880

He was a punk.

02:57:44,480 --> 02:57:45,340
She did ballet.

1665
02:57:45,960 --> 02:57:48,060
What more can I say?

1666
02:57:48,900 --> 02:57:50,200
He wanted her.

problem with him.

Wear your helmet.

1698
03:00:41,190 --> 03:00:43,690
Because not wearing your helmet is not rad.

1699
03:00:44,190 --> 03:00:45,810
It's not radical, bro.

1700
03:00:48,210 --> 03:00:49,910
Yo, what the fuck?

03:00:50,830 --> 03:00:51,670

1704
03:00:59,730 --> 03:01:00,330

1711
03:02:01,170 --> 03:02:08,430

Um...

1749
03:06:32,370 --> 03:06:33,010
Um, I...

1750
03:06:33,830 --> 03:06:34,850
I checked out...

1751
03:06:34,850 --> 03:06:36,310
I finally checked out Iron Lung.

1752
03:06:38,610 --> 03:06:39,090
For...

1753
03:06:39,090 --> 03:06:39,890
Um...

1754
03:06:39,890 --> 03:06:40,890
Because I...

1755
03:06:40,890 --> 03:06:41,910
You know, the Markiplier movie.

1756
03:06:41,970 --> 03:06:43,070
By the way, for those who don't know.

1757
03:06:43,390 --> 03:06:46,010
Um, I finally checked out the new Markiplier movie.

1758
03:06:46,130 --> 03:06:46,990
Because, you know...

1759
03:06:46,990 --> 03:06:47,970
I want to know...

1760
03:06:47,970 --> 03:06:53,850
I wanted to know if the movie, because like, you know, use
critics didn't like it, but users love it.

1761
03:06:54,010 --> 03:06:58,130
But then also, like, user reviews tend to be more so of
Markiplier fans, you know?

1762
03:06:59,030 --> 03:07:02,170
So I just wanted to see, like, what's it all about?

1763
03:07:02,310 --> 03:07:05,530
And the movie apparently was only going to be in theaters
for one week, apparently.

1764
03:07:09,250 --> 03:07:12,410
And I managed to check it out.

1765
03:07:12,990 --> 03:07:15,890
And I will say, I think it's okay.

1766
03:07:17,970 --> 03:07:18,970
think it's okay.

1767
03:07:20,310 --> 03:07:23,950
Markiplier is surprisingly a pretty good actor.

1768
03:07:25,610 --> 03:07:27,930
He is like he is surprisingly pretty good actor.

1769
03:07:28,890 --> 03:07:33,550
And it all really takes place in one location, like
literally like in that submarine thing.

1770
03:07:34,450 --> 03:07:43,490
And I think like I feel like my only issue with the movie is
that there's a lot of like the hints about his backstory.

1771
03:07:44,390 --> 03:07:47,710
Like the ending was very confusing.

1772
03:07:47,970 --> 03:07:54,950
um but like they hint about like how he because he's like a
convict or whatever he's like a prisoner that was sent into

1773
03:07:54,950 --> 03:08:03,590
the submarine but they're never like super clear on why he
was a prisoner in the first place you get like little tiny

1774
03:08:03,590 --> 03:08:14,330
hints or whatever but it's so confusing it's really really
confusing and apparently um apparently i was reading like

1775
03:08:14,330 --> 03:08:21,130
the reddit and the wiki about like what the fuck was going
on I was like, I was, I literally, after the movie, I was

1776
03:08:21,130 --> 03:08:24,290
like, Iron Lung ending explain.

1777
03:08:27,290 --> 03:08:29,090
I literally went to Google.

1778
03:08:29,290 --> 03:08:31,490
I was like, Iron Lung explain.

1779
03:08:32,510 --> 03:08:39,670
Like, because I was like, there was like some parts where I
was very confused.

1780
03:08:40,210 --> 03:08:50,330
And, and there was a summary of it being that explained that
if you have gain knowledge, you'll understand more so of why

1781
03:08:50,330 --> 03:08:56,750
he was a prisoner because the game explains it like the game
lore explains why he was a prisoner and stuff so apparently

1782
03:08:56,750 --> 03:09:04,710
there's like a political um there was like a political fight
between two uh two governing bodies and he was part of the

1783
03:09:04,710 --> 03:09:13,650
governing body that lost basically so and uh he was a
political he was basically a political prisoner and so I was

1784
03:09:13,650 --> 03:09:21,790
like okay that makes a lot more sense now like what he did
as like what he did to get became a prisoner and like the

1785
03:09:21,790 --> 03:09:26,130
game explains it and the guy was explaining it and
everything I was like oh that makes more sense but it's very

1786
03:09:26,130 --> 03:09:32,710
vague it's very vague in the movie itself on why he was a
prisoner and stuff but like I wouldn't mind it but they kept

1787
03:09:32,710 --> 03:09:38,510
trying to explain it in the movie but it was so confusing
because it didn't make much more sense like because it was

1788
03:09:38,510 --> 03:09:44,790
like it felt like It was like five to 10 second scenes of
like, like trauma memories from him.

1789
03:09:48,730 --> 03:09:54,930
He would have like trauma memories that would show up for
like five to 10 seconds, but it made no sense to me on what

1790
03:09:54,930 --> 03:09:56,350
the fuck he's trying to remember.

1791
03:09:58,750 --> 03:10:01,410
I was like, yeah, yeah.

1792
03:10:01,810 --> 03:10:05,930
So like, and so, so like that was the confusing part.

1793
03:10:06,050 --> 03:10:09,010
The ending was also a little confusing too.

1794
03:10:11,690 --> 03:10:22,250
confusing because it was like it was like i was like i like
the ending there was a part where he he he like starts

1795
03:10:22,250 --> 03:10:31,770
deteriorating his body starts deteriorating and um and then
i didn't i and then there was like a lot of voices basically

1796
03:10:31,770 --> 03:10:38,510
it was like what do the voices say because there was a lot
of voices going on in the ending and every apparently some

1797
03:10:38,510 --> 03:10:46,090
of the voices are giving like really good plot points of
what the fuck was going on and then and then but there were

1798
03:10:46,090 --> 03:10:51,870
so many voices it was like you know when like I was playing
that voice too and it was like Santa's not real

1799
03:10:56,650 --> 03:11:07,030
and and like but like half of those voices are trying to
give you like important information yeah but but like that's

1800
03:11:07,030 --> 03:11:17,190
what's like super confusing for me at one point but i it was
just be like some scenes are yeah it's like the ending has a

1801
03:11:17,190 --> 03:11:25,350
very confusing point there but like you know the end result
it's like oh okay but then like the ending scene gets very

1802
03:11:25,350 --> 03:11:35,230
confusing at one point um cooler thank you the super chat
thank you thank you yo skaterbird happy tokyversary love

your throwback outfit also tomorrow's my birthday can you

1805
03:11:50,810 --> 03:12:02,390
dear cooler happy birthday to you yeah happy birthday yeah
but yeah other than that it's like it was a good movie um it

1806
03:12:02,390 --> 03:12:11,850
was just i will say it wasn't my type of movie because it's
a very slow burn if you like slow burn and that's I it took

1807
03:12:11,850 --> 03:12:23,630
a while to get there the first hour is like basically like
nothing is really going on and the first it's a two hour

1808
03:12:23,630 --> 03:12:32,330
movie and the first hour there's really nothing to go on but
like each but even though it's one hour like even though

1809
03:12:32,330 --> 03:12:38,270
there's like nothing really going on in that hour like
little bits and pieces are foreshadowing the rest of the

1810
03:12:38,270 --> 03:12:50,370
movie like i i swear to god i wanted to look at my phone in
that first hour right yeah it's a very slow start but when

1811
03:12:50,370 --> 03:13:00,190
it ramps up it goes hard and like fucking gas gas gas into
like lots of shit is happening after the first hour um but

1812
03:13:00,190 --> 03:13:09,330
like that first hour was a hurdle for me because i'm not
very good at i'm not very good at slow burn i i'm i'm not

1813
03:13:09,330 --> 03:13:20,830
very good at slow burn so so the first hour was a big hurdle
but after the hour is gone like it fucking goes hard but

1814
03:13:20,830 --> 03:13:25,250
that's my that's my honest opinion on iron line

1815
03:13:31,130 --> 03:13:45,320
yeah i need my fortnite skins in that movie i need my subway
surfers but yeah no i i think he did really well for um as

1816
03:13:45,320 --> 03:13:47,580
like a you know as an indie movie project.

1817
03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:48,000
That's all.

1818
03:13:48,200 --> 03:13:51,180
The fact that he wrote that movie himself was very
impressive.

1819
03:13:51,660 --> 03:13:54,780
I did not realize he wrote it himself too.

1820
03:13:54,840 --> 03:13:56,080
I did not realize he was a writer.

1821
03:13:57,900 --> 03:13:58,740
He's very talented.

1822
03:13:58,940 --> 03:14:02,720
Being able to write, direct, and produce a movie all on his
own.

1823
03:14:02,980 --> 03:14:04,220
And act in it too.

1824
03:14:07,380 --> 03:14:10,560
Usually, like, you know, usually we just hire a writer, but
he wrote it himself.

1825
03:14:11,200 --> 03:14:12,660
So I was, like, really impressed with that.

1826
03:14:14,400 --> 03:14:14,800
Okay.

1827
03:14:15,920 --> 03:14:16,480
Yeah.

1828
03:14:17,640 --> 03:14:19,290
He funded himself too, yeah.

1829
03:14:29,720 --> 03:14:31,620
Joki movie went fucking...

1830
03:14:34,040 --> 03:14:35,340
3D first.

1831
03:14:35,800 --> 03:14:37,460
And 3D debut first.

1832
03:14:39,340 --> 03:14:40,080
And...

1833
03:14:40,080 --> 03:14:44,500
One day.

1834
03:14:57,440 --> 03:15:02,040
I had to delay the 3D debut only because, like I said, I
didn't have time to travel.

1835
03:15:02,600 --> 03:15:04,740
No time to travel last year.

1836
03:15:05,360 --> 03:15:10,680
the last half year no time to travel at all too many
obligations

1837
03:15:14,460 --> 03:15:21,980
i think that's why it's definitely harder as an indie i know
some people were like oh man streaming is so easy but it

1838
03:15:21,980 --> 03:15:30,740
also depends on what you want to do as a streamer too um i
want to do a lot of things so that like i don't just like

1839
03:15:30,740 --> 03:15:40,520
sit there i want to do like a lot of fun fun things for you
guys like a lot of like variety stuff and um and like and

1840
03:15:40,520 --> 03:15:49,120
like do a lot of projects and everything and because of that
like i have to like manage i'm so bad at time management i'm

1841
03:15:49,120 --> 03:15:53,820
so fucking bad i have so little time so many projects

1842
03:16:00,500 --> 03:16:07,100
gen gen x thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you hey
doki you can't stick around for the stream today but just

1844
03:16:10,300 --> 03:16:12,160
Here's hoping for more fun years to come.

1845
03:16:12,380 --> 03:16:13,600
Thank you, the Akasupa.

1846
03:16:13,820 --> 03:16:15,240
And thank you for just dropping by.

1847
03:16:15,640 --> 03:16:17,880
And for the Akasupa, it really does mean a lot.

1848
03:16:17,960 --> 03:16:19,280
I really appreciate the support.

1849
03:16:19,880 --> 03:16:20,540
Thank you.

1850
03:16:21,100 --> 03:16:25,000
But, like, I'm worried one day I'm just going to run out of
ideas.

1851
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:26,580
That's what I'm most worried about.

1852
03:16:26,900 --> 03:16:31,280
Because, like, I have some fun ideas for my birthday.

1853
03:16:31,280 --> 03:16:32,480
I know what to do for my birthday.

1854
03:16:33,800 --> 03:16:37,560
I know what to do for my next outfit reveal.

1855
03:16:38,120 --> 03:16:52,360
but it's like what about next year like i'm like i'm running
out of ideas that's my biggest worry i always tell myself

1856
03:16:52,360 --> 03:17:01,140
though when i hit a million i will i would like calm down i
would like calm down more because that was my that's my

1857
03:17:01,140 --> 03:17:07,820
biggest goal i think after a million i'm like i like that's
why i'm like i made it and i disappeared no i'm joking i'm

1858
03:17:07,880 --> 03:17:19,660
I'm joking, I'm just, please, please don't subscribe, I
won't disappear, I, I'm, I'm joking, I'll come back, I'll

1859
03:17:19,660 --> 03:17:31,580
still be here, yeah, please, don't, you already made it,
yeah, but it's like, a million is when you're like, oh my

1860
03:17:31,580 --> 03:17:38,140
gosh, I made it, made it, you know, you get a little golden
button, you know, it's, it's like the silver button, but

1861
03:17:38,140 --> 03:17:50,740
it's yellow and it's like me color basically unsubbing it's
like it's me color that's

1862
03:17:58,350 --> 03:18:08,730
why you hire a creative team you know i love being like
hands i do delegate but i also love being hands on because i

1863
03:18:08,730 --> 03:18:22,770
feel like my ideas like the things i want to do and my ideas
are like i feel like some of the things i think of like are

1864
03:18:22,770 --> 03:18:32,770
not are things that like a creative team wouldn't think of
themselves type deal things i want to do and like i like

1865
03:18:32,770 --> 03:18:42,750
having like a lot of creative input on how stuff like on how
things are done but like you know like i mean for the

1866
03:18:42,750 --> 03:18:48,730
tournament i'm like not that hands-on to be fair i do did
give suggestions for it um you know for the PUBG tournament

1867
03:18:48,730 --> 03:18:56,010
I like because it's like under my name I gave a lot of like
guidance on tournament structure and stuff and how like how

1868
03:18:56,010 --> 03:19:02,970
the tournament should be run because originally they wanted
rehearsals they wanted rehearsals for the tournament and I

1869
03:19:02,970 --> 03:19:10,930
straight up told them I was like you are not getting these
streamers together at the same day at the same time to show

1870
03:19:10,930 --> 03:19:21,630
up for these rehearsals I'm sorry like It's like, that is a
very impossible ask that you're trying to get.

1871
03:19:22,370 --> 03:19:27,510
Like, I was like, I was like, you're not coordinating.

1872
03:19:28,210 --> 03:19:37,630
You're not coordinating four teams of five to all show up on
the same day, at the same time to do a rehearsal.

1873
03:19:37,790 --> 03:19:39,570
That is like unfeasible.

1874
03:19:41,510 --> 03:19:43,210
Like, it might work.

1875
03:19:43,210 --> 03:19:51,070
it might i honestly think like because like it's um pubg for
those who don't know is um i assume wait let me double check

1876
03:19:51,070 --> 03:20:00,930
like the company it's a production team is uh the production
team uh is uh crafton which is a south korean um video game

1877
03:20:00,930 --> 03:20:08,110
publishing i'll assume that like i know like in asia a lot
of tournaments do rehearsals too uh or like scrims like you

1878
03:20:08,110 --> 03:20:16,390
know in asia scrims and rehearsals for tournaments it's
quite common but you'd be lucky if NA pro teams even show up

1879
03:20:16,390 --> 03:20:17,370
for scrims.

1880
03:20:20,050 --> 03:20:32,530
You'd be lucky if professional players who are professional
at their chosen games even show up to like practice an NA.

1881
03:20:37,750 --> 03:20:46,170
So, I was like, yeah, like we have to, like I was straight
up told them like you have to get rid of rehearsals

1882
03:20:52,890 --> 03:21:00,510
yeah i would be like you can get half the team like maybe
like half the participants not even half the team not even

1883
03:21:00,510 --> 03:21:07,990
like the full roster of each team but more so of like maybe
like two to three of the players and one team will show up

1884
03:21:10,510 --> 03:21:16,910
no seriously and it is just do it on game day we just show
up Sleepy.

1885
03:21:17,170 --> 03:21:18,390
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1886
03:21:18,650 --> 03:21:18,910
Thank you.

1887
03:21:19,190 --> 03:21:19,870
Thank you.

1888
03:21:19,870 --> 03:21:22,430
I'm going to join Jen with leaving at work in the morning.

1889
03:21:23,170 --> 03:21:26,770
Avriola Doki was one little thing and hope the money is sent
will help fund future projects.

1890
03:21:27,350 --> 03:21:29,490
Lastly, to those who I saw in chat, thank you for the
membership.

1891
03:21:29,610 --> 03:21:30,350
Don't mention it.

1892
03:21:30,370 --> 03:21:31,690
Happy Dokiversary.

1893
03:21:32,090 --> 03:21:33,410
Thank you, the Akasupa.

1894
03:21:33,670 --> 03:21:34,670
I really appreciate it.

1895
03:21:34,950 --> 03:21:36,110
Thank you so much for the support.

1896
03:21:36,550 --> 03:21:39,350
I hope you have a good day at work in the morning tomorrow.

1897
03:21:39,690 --> 03:21:42,930
But thank you for giving up your time to watch me and for
the support.

1898
03:21:43,130 --> 03:21:44,250
I really appreciate it.

1899
03:21:46,610 --> 03:21:52,590
Even though, even so if it was a practice, I do not think I
like straight up was like, I think it's like incredibly hard

1900
03:21:52,590 --> 03:22:00,810
to coordinate as someone that has seen the, as someone that
has, that knows the NA scene and like how busy streamers are

1901
03:22:00,810 --> 03:22:01,470
in general.

1902
03:22:02,190 --> 03:22:06,950
Like I know like, like especially like how busy like content
creators and streamers are in general.

1903
03:22:07,390 --> 03:22:11,750
It's very hard to coordinate like how many people are
participating?

1904
03:22:11,890 --> 03:22:15,810
Five, 10, 15, 20, I guess like 20 people all at once.

1905
03:22:15,830 --> 03:22:22,730
to come together like Giro thank you for the Aka Aka Aka
Supa!

1906
03:22:23,870 --> 03:22:24,330
Thank you!

1907
03:22:24,810 --> 03:22:30,550
Happy anniversary to my Kamioshi at work tonight but I just
want to thank you for making me and so many other smiles to

1908
03:22:30,550 --> 03:22:35,070
many more years to come I should say stay very strong and
stay smiling again!

1909
03:22:35,070 --> 03:22:37,570
Thank you for the Aka Aka Aka Supa!

1910
03:22:38,010 --> 03:22:39,570
Thank you for the support!

1911
03:22:40,690 --> 03:22:45,110
I would have a good day at work tonight but thank you again
I really appreciate it guys.

1912
03:22:45,210 --> 03:22:56,030
Thank you so for giving up your time um hanging out with me
and to celebrate donkey day two years two years um but yeah

1913
03:22:56,030 --> 03:23:04,090
and what else what else did i say i like gave several oh
yeah and then i said don't do it on valentine's day because

1914
03:23:04,090 --> 03:23:12,730
i was like um i was like a lot of content creators also
stream on valentine's day and i feel like especially like

1915
03:23:12,730 --> 03:23:21,730
vtube reviewers don't want to watch might not because like
they said they wanted to invite like vtubers as well um so

1916
03:23:21,730 --> 03:23:27,810
like lily peachy's team was like uh the vtuber team and i
advised i also said like other than the fact that i was like

1917
03:23:27,810 --> 03:23:34,370
my dog's birthday is on valentine's day so like i personally
would not want it on valentine's day because i always

1918
03:23:34,370 --> 03:23:40,230
celebrate dad's birthday on valentine's day but i also said
that a lot of streamers tend to tend to stream on

1919
03:23:40,230 --> 03:23:47,330
valentine's day as well um so i was just like i think people
I think the streamers, whichever streamer you would invite,

1920
03:23:47,870 --> 03:23:53,450
whatever streamer you would invite, they would prefer, like,
doing a regular stream than a tournament stream.

1921
03:23:53,730 --> 03:23:55,350
So I, like, gave that advice, too.

1922
03:23:55,930 --> 03:23:59,030
And also the fact that I straight up said, like, I need to
celebrate my dog's birthday.

1923
03:23:59,370 --> 03:24:01,730
Like, it's tradition.

1924
03:24:02,490 --> 03:24:03,030
It's tradition.

1925
03:24:03,070 --> 03:24:05,910
I chose my dog over a tournament.

1926
03:24:12,900 --> 03:24:13,820
That's right.

1927
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:15,540
I chose my dog.

1928
03:24:25,110 --> 03:24:31,990
and also like, then they were like, what about the 12th and
13th, and I know like Min's concert was on the 13th, and I

1929
03:24:31,990 --> 03:24:37,750
know a lot of you guys are also heading towards Min's
concert or like going to watch the stream, so I was like, I

1930
03:24:37,750 --> 03:24:45,210
guess like I felt like, oh since I felt like we should keep
the 13th, like we shouldn't have 13th as well because of

1931
03:24:45,210 --> 03:24:48,430
that, and I was like just put it on the 15th and 16th, this
feels like the best.

1932
03:24:57,340 --> 03:25:06,200
yeah yeah so like there's like pieces of advice i gave them
regarding like how like i even like gave tips regarding

1933
03:25:06,200 --> 03:25:14,540
algorithm too because like uh twit like like you know that's
what i'm saying like um i like to be more i like i like

1934
03:25:14,540 --> 03:25:21,560
being hands-on with some projects and stuff or like having
input on them because i i've done this for a long time i've

1935
03:25:21,560 --> 03:25:26,580
done it for a long time so i sort of like know like what you
should do and what you shouldn't do for these types of

1936
03:25:26,580 --> 03:25:34,280
things and then i even told them like when i found out about
lily peachy's team i straight up i straight up the first

1937
03:25:34,280 --> 03:25:40,220
thing i said when i was like what because i was the last
person to have a finalized team um because it was very like

1938
03:25:40,220 --> 03:25:46,040
because like timing and like a lot of my friends are really
busy on that day um and that someone dropped out as well so

1939
03:25:46,040 --> 03:25:56,060
i was the last person to finalize my entire team roster but
and and then like i was told lily peachy's team ashtray up

1940
03:25:56,060 --> 03:26:02,820
told them when they told me their team i was like you have
to tell them like what kind of tournament this is like like

1941
03:26:02,820 --> 03:26:08,660
that like the skilled level of this tournament because i
would feel bad you know i would feel really bad because what

1942
03:26:08,660 --> 03:26:16,340
if they got in being like being like oh it's um it's very
like super casual and then I found out the rosters of the

1943
03:26:16,340 --> 03:26:22,360
other two teams and I was like okay like these guys are
sweaty so then I was like you have to tell the Pichu team

1944
03:26:22,360 --> 03:26:28,960
like the skill level of this tournament and like what the
expectation will be like going in so they're not you know

1945
03:26:28,960 --> 03:26:38,940
they're not like oh my god what the fuck yeah you know you
know I didn't want them to go in like blindsided you know

1946
03:26:38,940 --> 03:26:47,400
and because like i've had so many experiences in especially
like in twitch rivals where i was told like it'll be a

1947
03:26:47,400 --> 03:26:52,800
casual thing don't worry and then i'd be like the like you
said remember i don't know if you guys remember the

1948
03:26:52,800 --> 03:26:58,800
fortnight tournament i was invited to i was invited to where
i was told i'd be like don't worry it'll be a casual

1949
03:26:58,800 --> 03:27:04,620
fortnight event and i was like oh that's fine and i find i
was the only person that wasn't a fortnight player that was

1950
03:27:04,620 --> 03:27:05,380
invited to

1951
03:27:09,120 --> 03:27:11,740
and I was like what the fuck guys

1952
03:27:15,320 --> 03:27:22,920
so like so I didn't want them like because I've had
experiences like that where I would get into a tournament

1953
03:27:22,920 --> 03:27:33,380
and realize wait this was a lot sweatier than what I assumed
at first and then so I was like you have to tell her like

1954
03:27:33,380 --> 03:27:41,140
when I found out I was like you gotta let her know because I
don't want her to be like, what the fuck going in?

1955
03:27:47,050 --> 03:27:49,270
Yeah, I was, I needed a plus one.

1956
03:27:49,830 --> 03:27:49,830
Yeah.

1957
03:27:50,950 --> 03:27:56,050
They're like, tell her it's casual, but she'll say yes to
anything, and they were right.

1958
03:27:59,810 --> 03:28:01,150
They were right.

1959
03:28:02,010 --> 03:28:02,350
I did.

1960
03:28:02,690 --> 03:28:04,070
Even the party animals.

1961
03:28:04,510 --> 03:28:05,170
Oh my god.

1962
03:28:05,450 --> 03:28:07,490
Remember the party animals, Twitch rivals?

1963
03:28:07,930 --> 03:28:10,110
I was like, oh, it's a party game.

1964
03:28:10,210 --> 03:28:11,270
It should be casual.

1965
03:28:11,770 --> 03:28:21,090
find out going in i found out that there were like people
hardcore grinding party animals for like 10 plus hours

1966
03:28:21,090 --> 03:28:30,010
before twitch rivals like before the tournament started and
they had like knew all the meta and all the fucking like all

1967
03:28:30,010 --> 03:28:40,530
the meta and like the the tech for party animals and i was
like what i thought this was a party game i they knew like

1968
03:28:40,530 --> 03:28:49,910
what the matter like what all the game modes are like like
like even party games weren't safe

1969
03:29:03,830 --> 03:29:11,630
guys yeah it was crazy that's why i was like straight up
like like you know from the experiences I've built up over

1970
03:29:11,630 --> 03:29:25,830
from the experiences I've built up over the years like my I
share my wisdom to others I share it with others so

1971
03:29:30,370 --> 03:29:32,990
that we won't repeat the same mistake again

1972
03:29:40,110 --> 03:29:47,890

1973
03:29:54,950 --> 03:30:02,250

believe it oh my gosh it's been like almost four hours I

1974
03:30:02,250 --> 03:30:11,710

1975
03:30:11,710 --> 03:30:19,490

1978
03:30:46,470 --> 03:30:53,250
we've been here Eight years Oh my god Is it really?

1979
03:30:54,270 --> 03:31:01,570
I know I like I know I have a Twitch clip That was six years
ago I don't know if it was seven or eight years When I

1980
03:31:01,570 --> 03:31:04,150
started like being more serious About V-Tubing

1981
03:31:08,350 --> 03:31:11,510
It was either seven or eight I don't remember

1982
03:31:19,170 --> 03:31:32,090
But like But like Oh eight years here Holy fuck I've been
doing this for eight years Oh my God.

1983
03:31:32,090 --> 03:31:34,250
How do I, I'm, oh my God.

1984
03:31:37,330 --> 03:31:41,510
That's, that's insane to think about in my head that I've
been doing this for eight years.

1985
03:31:41,590 --> 03:31:42,710
Now it does not feel like eight years.

1986
03:31:42,990 --> 03:31:44,250
No wonder I look like this.

1987
03:31:45,010 --> 03:31:47,470
This is how it looks like after eight years.

1988
03:31:47,750 --> 03:31:54,070
This is me like, this was like, this is like four years and
then this is eight years.

1989
03:32:00,010 --> 03:32:08,830
But I have to let you guys remember, um, the first three to
four years of that streaming career I think it was like

1990
03:32:08,830 --> 03:32:16,850
three years for the first three to four years of that
streaming career I basically had no streaming career like I

1991
03:32:16,850 --> 03:32:26,470
never got partnered um when I was in indie before I know I'm
indie now but um before corporal I was never partnered I got

1992
03:32:26,470 --> 03:32:33,910
rejected three times for partnering by the way three times
for partner um to be fair the last two attempts was me said

1993
03:32:33,910 --> 03:32:40,750
i sent the b movie script to be fair for those who want like
laura uh the first time i sent in a real application the

1994
03:32:40,750 --> 03:32:47,030
second and third time um i don't remember what i sent for
the third time but the second time i sent in the b movie

1995
03:32:47,030 --> 03:32:56,990
script because i was like do they even read this uh and then
the third time i don't even remember what i think i also i

1996
03:32:56,990 --> 03:33:04,730
sent uh i sent the i sent something but i don't remember
what script it was I don't I just I just stop caring because

1997
03:33:04,730 --> 03:33:17,910
at that time when I sent in the third partner application I
already got in I got my acceptance letter so then I was like

1998
03:33:17,910 --> 03:33:25,590
whatever like because I was like fuck that I'm like you
going corporal baby like so then I was just like I don't

1999
03:33:25,590 --> 03:33:26,470
fucking care

2000
03:33:31,970 --> 03:33:32,770
I don't care.

2001
03:33:32,970 --> 03:33:34,370
I'm piecing out.

2002
03:33:34,770 --> 03:33:36,630
And then, and then I, you know, I came back.

2003
03:33:39,470 --> 03:33:43,130
and I was like, and then I was, cause like, I have the third
attempt.

2004
03:33:43,230 --> 03:33:44,670
I was like, who cares?

2005
03:33:44,870 --> 03:33:47,350
I don't need this no more.

2006
03:33:50,830 --> 03:34:00,270
Um, anyway, um, but like I said, like, I never really made
it at first when I was, when I was first in indie because I

2007
03:34:00,270 --> 03:34:11,610
never, um, I didn't, okay, to be fair, when I was first in
Indie, uh, eight years ago, like, my first three years of

2008
03:34:11,610 --> 03:34:14,790
YouTubing eight years ago, I didn't talk to anybody.

2009
03:34:15,330 --> 03:34:20,590
Like, I talked to people, but I, but it was more so of like
Twitter mutuals, stuff like that.

2010
03:34:20,990 --> 03:34:22,310
Like, I was raw.

2011
03:34:22,450 --> 03:34:24,430
I still came back and I keep crawling back.

2012
03:34:26,610 --> 03:34:38,470
Anyway, um, um, so, um, So when I actually got serious about
it, I never really like interacted with other VTubers or

2013
03:34:38,470 --> 03:34:41,850
like, you know, I never really tried talking to anybody.

2014
03:34:43,010 --> 03:34:46,250
I do have, I did have like Twitter mutuals and they were
mostly like art friends.

2015
03:34:46,890 --> 03:34:52,630
So, you know, like, you know, I talked to like a lot of
artists back then because I was an artist back then as well.

2016
03:34:52,850 --> 03:34:54,390
So I commissioned a lot of art.

2017
03:34:54,530 --> 03:35:00,510
I also like, I loved interacting with a lot of like artists
and stuff and just, you know, talk to have a lot of artists

2018
03:35:00,510 --> 03:35:01,010
friends.

2019
03:35:01,970 --> 03:35:09,190
back then and but i never really like collab with people i
never really collab with people i never really like try the

2020
03:35:09,190 --> 03:35:17,770
social climb or anything or like increase my network i never
networked at all i was mostly a solo streamer who or who

2021
03:35:17,770 --> 03:35:24,610
would play with my rank buddies who aren't really streamers
but they were just really good at apex or some shit or

2022
03:35:24,610 --> 03:35:36,230
really good at overwatch but they weren't interact with a
lot of overwatch streamers back then but i never streamed

2023
03:35:36,230 --> 03:35:46,230
when i never really streamed when i was bumping into like
overwatch streamers um so um it was only when later on it

2024
03:35:46,230 --> 03:35:52,510
was only i only started networking when i was in corpo
because i knew like i had to actually interact with people

2025
03:35:52,510 --> 03:35:58,590
when i like i was like i'm gonna be a new person i'm gonna
actually be social and interact with people and make new

2026
03:35:58,590 --> 03:36:07,050
friends i'm not gonna be a show social out like my indie
days I'm gonna interact with a lot of people because I knew

2027
03:36:07,050 --> 03:36:14,990
like that's what you have to do when you're like in the
corporal like that's how you like build yourself up um um

2028
03:36:14,990 --> 03:36:20,190
because it was like my golden ticket so I was just like oh I
shouldn't I should make sure like you know I should take

2029
03:36:20,190 --> 03:36:28,190
advantage of what they gave me so uh yeah I was like I
should take advantage of what i they gave me and what um

2030
03:36:28,190 --> 03:36:37,030
what um of this golden opportunity because it wasn't like
you know it was like uh you know i wanted to like hit the

2031
03:36:37,030 --> 03:36:43,510
hit the wall running type deal and yeah make the most of
everything yeah and then that's when i started interacting

2032
03:36:43,510 --> 03:36:49,970
with a lot of people when i hit the when i was in the
company and then after i came back as an indie i have i have

2033
03:36:49,970 --> 03:36:51,130
trust issues now

2034
03:36:55,750 --> 03:37:09,190
interact with a lot of people but then I'm so tired and yeah
and then I was just like I was like um after that I was just

2035
03:37:09,190 --> 03:37:16,610
like I just want to be in my little in my little circle and
I interacted yeah I was like too I was tired from

this I was like

2037

I'll get back to you soon

2043
03:38:25,630 --> 03:38:33,570
Like, I never thought I could ever actually have this as a
career, not gonna lie.

2044
03:38:33,670 --> 03:38:40,750
Like I said, I, when I first started streaming, like, I was
fucking, I was a nobody.

2045
03:38:44,130 --> 03:38:47,570
Also, I did not care about, like, schedules or whatever.

2046
03:38:47,830 --> 03:38:50,030
I fucking, I did not care about being consistent.

2047
03:38:50,210 --> 03:38:51,510
I didn't care about, like, schedules.

2048
03:38:51,830 --> 03:38:53,250
I didn't care about variety.

2049
03:38:53,450 --> 03:38:55,610
I was like, I'm going to play Apex for 20 hours.

2050
03:38:55,630 --> 03:39:01,070
And you're gonna watch that I mean, well not really people
didn't really watch me I'm just like if someone shows up

2051
03:39:01,070 --> 03:39:12,690
that's pretty cool like I was like I'm gonna stream apex now
for 13 plus hours in rank and then like if some like someone

2052
03:39:12,690 --> 03:39:20,530
talks in my chat That's pretty cool and then after and then
I keep doing consistently I'll do it consistently and then I

2053
03:39:20,530 --> 03:39:27,610
would have like I would have like a 20 plus view 20 to 30
viewer average and I was like This is, I'm actually getting

2054
03:39:27,610 --> 03:39:28,590
an audience now.

2055
03:39:28,890 --> 03:39:30,610
This is getting too real.

2056
03:39:31,090 --> 03:39:33,390
All right, guys, I'm going to disappear for five months.

2057
03:39:37,550 --> 03:39:40,190
I was like, wow, I'm actually starting to build a community.

2058
03:39:40,670 --> 03:39:41,550
All right, guys, peace.

2059
03:39:41,730 --> 03:39:42,650
I'm going to leave now.

2060
03:39:42,790 --> 03:39:46,410
I'm going to grind off stream for five plus months.

2061
03:39:46,750 --> 03:39:48,810
I guess I'll see you guys when I see you.

2062
03:39:49,570 --> 03:39:51,350
And this will happen a lot.

2063
03:39:52,550 --> 03:39:53,850
This will happen a lot.

2064
03:39:54,090 --> 03:39:58,130
If anyone's a Bark Night, they will remember all the hiatus.

2065
03:39:58,150 --> 03:40:00,030
as I've taken over the years.

2066
03:40:00,170 --> 03:40:02,870
Yeah, the self-sabotage was very real.

2067
03:40:03,990 --> 03:40:04,490
Oh, wow.

2068
03:40:04,510 --> 03:40:06,510
I'm actually sort of getting successful now.

2069
03:40:06,710 --> 03:40:07,590
I better stop.

2070
03:40:10,850 --> 03:40:12,490
No, it was legit.

2071
03:40:13,070 --> 03:40:17,930
I was sometimes they would be lucky if I even tell them when
I'm coming back.

2072
03:40:18,270 --> 03:40:23,610
Sometimes it just stops and then it just stops.

2073
03:40:24,070 --> 03:40:27,810
And then suddenly I would just go live and be like, I guess
I'm back, guys.

2074
03:40:27,870 --> 03:40:28,130
Hey.

2075

But yeah, like I said, sorry, I ruined the moment.

2116
03:44:21,750 --> 03:44:25,810
It was such a heartfelt moment.

2117
03:44:25,950 --> 03:44:27,450
And then I had to say it.

2118
03:44:27,690 --> 03:44:29,430
I let my Harambe out.

2119
03:44:30,550 --> 03:44:33,090
