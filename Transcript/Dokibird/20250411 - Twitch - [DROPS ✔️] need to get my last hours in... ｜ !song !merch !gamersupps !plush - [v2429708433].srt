00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,260
Hello everybo... I just realized I forgot to tweet that I'm live.

2
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,300
Give me a sec.

3
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,320
Live now.

4
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,660
That's awkward.

5
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,040
Whoops.

6
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,240
Give me a sec.

7
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,220
I just realized I was like, I did it.

8
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,040
And I was like, oh wait, I didn't do it.

9
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,300
I forgot the most important part.

10
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm saying I'm live.

11
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,980
Hello everybody.

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,600
I am back.

13
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,540
I am back.

14
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,620
So why am I back here?

15
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,380
Well, for those who don't know, I forgot to... I was short two hours, two and a half hours.

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,180
I said, that's what... wait, let me double check the exact... two hours and 31 minutes.

17
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:40,340
So I need to stream two hours and 31 minutes and then I'm done.

18
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,740
I'm done for this month and then I do it all over again next month.

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,600
But for next month, it'll be a lot easier because...

20
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,560
I don't know.

21
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,380
I don't know if I want to... I feel bad because I am playing high elo games like...

22
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,100
The games are high elo though.

23
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,040
That's the thing.

24
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:12,780
Like I will be... I am like the deciding factor of whether or not these people will be safe in top 500.

25
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,680
I am literally that person.

26
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:24,260
And I don't know if I want to... and it's all gonna be live on stream too.

27
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,700
So they have evidence to report me...

28
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,440
actively throwing their games.

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,380
If it was off stream, then I could just be like, oh sorry, I was doom queuing.

30
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,020
But then now people know I'm drunk and people know I've been drinking.

31
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:48,460
So I feel like it's... okay, to be fair, I've had other players throw my games while they're drunk.

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,060
But it wasn't top 500.

33
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,900
Okay, I was trying to... no, it was.

34
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,800
I was trying to get top 500 the last two days.

35
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,760
I'm not gonna make it guys.

36
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,260
I'm not getting... I'm not making it this season.

37
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,580
The rank reset really fucked up everything for me.

38
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:12,380
I do not... I did not have the time committed to grind as much as people did because of the rank reset.

39
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,840
I did not have the time.

40
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,960
But I also procrastinated a lot of my other actual work stuff to try and get it the last couple of weeks.

41
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,720
But like, I just couldn't.

42
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,640
It was just... it was too hard.

43
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,840
It was... I had a lot of really bad games.

44
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,900
I had some... I doom queued at one point.

45
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,300
And then I had some really bad games.

46
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,000
I also got flamed a lot too because of my doom queuing hours.

47
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,780
I was an elo terrorist.

48
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,900
So I don't know if I want an elo terrorist to get... I'm not gonna lie.

49
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,780
I was definitely an elo terrorist when I was doom queuing.

50
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
And like, I don't know.

51
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:15,600
I don't know if I want to... I don't know if like, I can live with the fact that I took away someone... I actually know I can.

52
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,900
I can sleep pretty well.

53
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,320
No, I can... I lie.

54
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,940
I can...

55
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,360
I can sleep pretty well and also like, can live with the fact that I ruined...

56
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,380
I might have ruined someone's chance to get in because if I can't be happy, no one can be happy.

57
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,280
But the... but the only thing that's like... the... okay, all right.

58
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,040
I'll admit it.

59
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:46,060
The only thing that's actually trying to prevent me from actually queuing up rank on my... because I only have...

60
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,620
I don't want to play low elo games too because that's not fun.

61
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:55,320
But like, because then like the low elo players are even... are even worse like, in terms of like, toxicity.

62
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,800
But like, because they think they deserve to be higher rank but they're not.

63
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,600
So then they're like, oh, it's because of you guys that I'm not hiring.

64
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:12,780
Anyway, the only thing that's preventing me from like, wanting to do it is because I'm streaming it and that like, people have like, concrete evidence that I was not sober.

65
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,440
Like...

66
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,080
If it was off stream, then I feel less... I don't... I feel... actually, I don't feel guilty.

67
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,160
I'm just...

68
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,260
I just don't want to get caught.

69
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,220
Like, I... I feel zero guilt.

70
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,760
I just don't want to get caught.

71
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,840
Like, if it was off stream, I could be like, oh, sorry.

72
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,540
I was just having a bad... I was just having a bad day.

73
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,720
So like, um, I... I was doom queuing.

74
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,280
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,200
But then like... but now that I have... people have evidence that I was definitely not sober.

76
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,740
I can't delete the VOD!

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,940
The whole point of me streaming right now is that I need to get my hours in.

78
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,160
I need to get my last two and a half hours in.

79
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,400
So... so I... I like, fit the quota.

80
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,860
So I get my quota.

81
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,640
Um... um... she... thank you for twitch prime.

82
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,060
Thank you.

83
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,820
Thank you.

84
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,140
Uh... um... Edison, thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

85
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,500
Thank you.

86
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,820
Thank you.

87
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,640
I really appreciate it.

88
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,600
Thank you so much.

89
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,820
Uh... but yeah, thank you guys.

90
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Alphina, thank you for the five gifted subs.

91
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,320
Thank you.

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,960
Thank you.

93
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:32,920
Um... what a quota is... so for those who don't know what the quota is, I have a partnership with Marvel Rivals where, um, trunk rank isn't batable.

94
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,880
Yes, but like, the lobbies I'm gonna get are with other pro players and other high-ranked players.

95
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,760
Guys, they're gonna remember what I did.

96
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:55,080
If I fucked over someone... um... if I fucked over there... there... I'm gonna get on a list.

97
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,100
Guys, I don't want to get on a list, guys.

98
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,720
Okay?

99
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,120
I... I don't want... I don't want to get on anybody's list, guys.

100
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,800
I... I'm scared.

101
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,480
Guys, they have a list, guys.

102
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:25,160
It's just like... okay, for those who don't know, back in the Overwatch days, um, the high... the high-ranked Overwatch players actually actively kept an int list... inting list.

103
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:36,800
So, like, for people they don't like or, like, have, like, done... like, they don't like, they will intentionally sabotage their games, um, because they, like, fucked them over.

104
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,000
Like... or, like, they're, like... like, if they did anything, they put them on the list.

105
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,320
And I don't want to go on that list, guys.

106
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,280
I... I've been a... I've been a...

107
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,800
I've been a... I've been a good VTuber.

108
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,460
I've just... I've been a good boy.

109
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,910
I've been a good boy, guys.

110
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,410
Santa said he's gonna get me presents on Christmas.

111
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,450
I do not want to get the cold... the cold neck this year.

112
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,210
Um, uh, no, I am not overthinking it.

113
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,070
They're... at one point, they're, like, um, I wrote... okay, for those who don't know, old Overwatch drama.

114
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:27,870
At one point, it... the... the Overwatch int-list got leaked to the public and... and to other streamers.

115
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:38,350
And, um, it was really bad, because basically, um, people were getting paid to intentionally sabotage games.

116
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,110
Like, this is old Overwatch lore.

117
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:50,630
So, it's, like, every time you sat... you... you, like, intentionally sabotage a game, um, you get paid X amount of money, and then you just send in screenshots, and then your PayPal...

118
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,070
and, like, they give you, like, gift cards or, like, PayPal transfer shit like that.

119
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:00,510
So, like, guys, knowing the path Overwatch took, I don't want to be on that list, guys.

120
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:15,370
Because the one time... because... because the one time I... I decided to drink and not be sober while playing Marvel Rivals ranked, guys.

121
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,310
Guys, I don't have the pro player killout, guys.

122
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,150
I didn't win first place in the MRC.

123
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,730
I don't have that.

124
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,270
All that I am to them is just some fucking anime PNG.

125
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,990
That's all I am to them.

126
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,010
Purple, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

127
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,470
Thank you.

128
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,210
Thank you.

129
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,070
So, yeah, I don't know.

130
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:39,650
I don't know.

131
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,290
I'll see how I feel later on.

132
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,430
Maybe... but then, like, okay, the thing is... the most fucked up thing is that I do have another...

133
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,630
I do have... I have two eternity counts.

134
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,650
One is my main, which is the high elo lobbies, and the other is low eternity.

135
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,990
But then what if I made someone drop out of eternity?

136
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,110
Oh, but then I won't see them again.

137
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,890
Okay, I might make... oh, man, but then I get caught.

138
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,070
And then maybe I get twitlocked, mate.

139
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,970
Like, streamer doesn't care about other... streamer doesn't take competitive seriously.

140
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:20,410
Purpose... purposely play so bad that it ruined my chance to be in eternity.

141
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,030
Streamer greased my game, does not take competitive seriously.

142
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,090
What kind of role model is she?

143
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,810
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

144
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,150
Thank you.

145
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,730
Thank you.

146
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,710
I don't know, man.

147
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,850
I'll see how I feel.

148
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,330
I'll do a couple of quick play first to see how I feel.

149
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,690
I'm still sipping on my soju.

150
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,510
I won't finish this soju, not gonna lie.

151
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,670
It's just a game.

152
00:11:51,110 --> 00:12:02,810
I spent 14 plus hours last... on Marvel Rivals each day the last three days, guys.

153
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:11,190
The amount of things and texts I've read the last three... I don't know how I'm mentally here.

154
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,470
This is why I'm drinking too.

155
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:30,770
I... The stuff I've seen and the stuff I've heard in the last three days with four 13 plus hours of Marvel Rivals.

156
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:51,530
I am pretty sure if any of those things got like... because I played a lot off stream too, but like if any of these things got and I was said while streaming, I may or may not have to like delete the vibe.

157
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:04,050
People were... People... People were not happy during like the end of the season rank ride.

158
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,590
People... Okay, this one was a good quote though, not gonna lie.

159
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,530
Like, I was like, okay, that's pretty clever.

160
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,030
But I was like, also that's like fucked up.

161
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,510
Like, bro, like chill.

162
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:22,410
Okay, so um, it was this guy in my lobby who was saying some really fucked up shit.

163
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,250
And then like this other guy was like being like, hey, that's not cool, man.

164
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,950
Like stop saying shit like that.

165
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:37,130
And then like, and then that guy that was saying some fucked up shit was like, um, it's okay.

166
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,930
I'm in the Marvel Rivals category.

167
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,250
This counts because I'm talking about Marvel Rivals.

168
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,390
They told me it still counts in the hours as long as I'm talking about Marvel Rivals.

169
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,650
So this is my loophole before I boot up the game.

170
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,790
I'm, I'm padding the time, guys.

171
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,250
I'm padding the stats right now.

172
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:08,990
Like, so, um, so basically, um, this other guy was like, hey, that's not cool.

173
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,750
Don't say that.

174
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,990
Like, bro, like, that's like, don't, I don't remember what he said, honestly.

175
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,570
Like, I, like, I heard a lot of stuff.

176
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,530
Guys, you don't understand.

177
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,630
I, I heard a lot of things and I've read a lot of things.

178
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,110
That was going on in the chat.

179
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,190
Um, um, anyway, like, I don't know.

180
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,390
That's why I'm drinking now.

181
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,370
Like after like the post-depression rank grind of not making it.

182
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:39,110
Um, anyway, so the guy that was like slurring and saying some really fucked up shit, he was like playing Luna Snow, right?

183
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:46,090
So like, she has the ability to put on a snowflake on somebody and it's like a Zen, a Zen orb, right?

184
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,450
And he was like, where's the snowflake?

185
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,510
Oh, there he is.

186
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,610
Here's a snowflake for a snowflake.

187
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,430
I was like, oh my God.

188
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,230
And like, I was like, okay.

189
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,250
That like stuck in my head.

190
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,010
I was like, holy shit.

191
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,990
No, but he was an asshole though.

192
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,310
Like that, that guy that was like saying something, he said some, he was saying some really fucked up shit.

193
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,770
I was like, like some very out of pocket stuff.

194
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,210
And like, I was like, Jesus Christ.

195
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,530
Like that, like that line, like that quote, like stuck in my head.

196
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,310
Cause I was like, okay, that's, that's pretty clever.

197
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,970
Like that's pretty, you're still an asshole, but that's, that's pretty fucking clever.

198
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,270
Um, next thing, thank you for gifting a sub to Cryer.

199
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:04,830
Thank you.

200
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,670
Thank you.

201
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,110
Um, um, anyway, no, it's bad.

202
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,750
It's bad.

203
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,450
It's, it's very bad for my health.

204
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,090
I, I, I was not okay.

205
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,650
I'm still not okay.

206
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,150
And then I had a, oh my God.

207
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,750
I'm trying to remember this game.

208
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,230
Um, oh my God.

209
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,290
It was, I had, guys, I had so many games.

210
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,690
I don't.

211
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,650
I had so many games.

212
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,110
I like, they all like blurred together.

213
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,230
Sometimes I don't even remember when I played these games.

214
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,690
I was just like, I don't remember the exact moments when this happened.

215
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,030
Like all these games have just blurred in together.

216
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,150
Cause it just all feels the same now.

217
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:58,870
I mean, I, I'm, I'm, I was not, no, I, yeah, no, I was in fucking elo hell.

218
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,050
That was, that was a miserable experience.

219
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:13,830
Um, this rank season has been honestly a very miserable experience if you're trying to get to top 500, but if you're playing for fun, like, and you don't care, it's fine.

220
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:21,730
But like when I, I try to take rank seriously the last week or so, and oh my God, it's fucking awful.

221
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:27,050
It's so, it's so bad.

222
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,710
Did you have any, bro, I can't even think of any good memories right now.

223
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,350
Like it has definitely like outweighed the bad.

224
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:50,490
I, I have like, I cannot like think of a good rank memory the last week, the last week.

225
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,810
I literally can't.

226
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,870
It's all been like a blurry mess.

227
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,770
What's the worst memory?

228
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,390
Um, the worst memory I've had.

229
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,850
Oh man, I told, I said a lot.

230
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,170
Like there were so many people.

231
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:05,470
Okay.

232
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:15,770
My, the worst memory is that when I'm playing with a professional player and, or like a player that's like well-known in the higher tier lobbies.

233
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,670
So like who are like, who like peaked like, you know, top 10 or whatever.

234
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,710
Um, and uh, so like, but like they're fucking up.

235
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,550
Like they know they're fucking up.

236
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:35,030
They've done like fucked up, like fucked plays or like they're intent, they're like inting and stuff and they're inting and stuff.

237
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,490
But like, I get blamed.

238
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:47,590
Cause they're like, oh, I can't blame the pro player obviously because like, you know, he's well-known in the scene.

239
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,810
And then they would blame me as the support player.

240
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,230
It's just like, what did I do?

241
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,410
I was so confused.

242
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,750
I was like, what did I do?

243
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:08,690
Like this person literally inted his ass off like four times in a row, but it's my fault.

244
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,950
Like the rat.

245
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,990
And then my friend would be like, no, it was my fault.

246
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,270
I don't understand why nobody said anything about what I just did.

247
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:24,450
I literally died first, like four times in a row because I decided to ego challenge this person.

248
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,550
And I was like, yeah, why didn't anybody say anything about you?

249
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:37,210
And then this happened to me multiple times during like the last week.

250
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,570
Cause I was like, what the fuck?

251
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,230
I was like, what did I do?

252
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,810
I literally just tried to fucking survive.

253
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:55,190
Like, yeah, no, this part counts cause I'm talking about Marvel Rivals.

254
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,570
Um, yeah.

255
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,010
So I was so confused.

256
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,230
I was like questioning, I would be like, what did I do?

257
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,910
I didn't do any bad, but they're like, oh, we lost because of you.

258
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,470
And I was like, what?

259
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,330
Did you not see my thing?

260
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:27,650
Literally fucking ran straight in and just collapsed from a fucking heart attack three to four times in a row.

261
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,210
Like nothing can save him.

262
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:41,850
I'm so confused, but that's like, um, that's like, um, one of my bad memories of it.

263
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,830
It's just cause like, it's so weird.

264
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,550
It's so weird.

265
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:58,790
They're too scared to yell at a, they're too scared to say anything to a pro player or like someone who is known in the like ranking slash streaming scene for just primarily Marvel Rivals.

266
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,590
Like those players are these like random players that are like just rank grinders.

267
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,290
They're too scared to say anything because they're like, oh my God, obviously they're really good players.

268
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:15,290
So they're just like, let me blame somebody that I don't know that like, you know, somebody that's not really in the scene and stuff like that.

269
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:21,050
And then I get picked sometimes like, like it's like, and they always pick the support players.

270
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,550
It's so fucking weird.

271
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,010
It's actually, um, it's so weird.

272
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,630
It's actually so fucking weird.

273
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,190
They always pick the support players.

274
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:41,210
So it's like, I always like, I don't always get targeted, but like if something bad happens and like, and I don't know, I played so many hours.

275
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,910
Uh, I played so many fucking hours that it happens occasionally.

276
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:59,190
It happens at least like if I do like a 13 plus hour grind session, um, for a day, um, it happens like at least three to four times out of like, I play a lot.

277
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,010
That's, that's a lot of games within 13 hours, by the way.

278
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,670
So it does happen like three to four times.

279
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,230
And I'll be like, who are these people?

280
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:12,810
Like, this is the very first time I've ever seen you.

281
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,450
Like, who, who are you?

282
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,990
I've never seen you before in this ELO.

283
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,390
Um, but yeah, I thought that was like, uh, super interesting.

284
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,470
Um, I don't, I can't think of a happy memory right now.

285
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:41,610
I'm like, what can I think of that would make me happy?

286
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,810
I don't know, guys.

287
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,090
I don't know.

288
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,890
Grinding is not happy.

289
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,870
Um, um, no, it's because like, I do enjoy Marvel Rivals.

290
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,290
It's the top 500 rank grind.

291
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,790
That's very, um, when I do it off stream, it's the top 500 rank grind.

292
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,470
That's not great.

293
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,510
It's not fun.

294
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,190
Um, it's not actually fun fun.

295
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:21,050
Like, you do it just because it's for, you do it for the end result of getting, of getting the rewards from it.

296
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,850
It's like the, it's not the journey.

297
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,370
It's the reward you get at the end.

298
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,530
Um, and that's why I do it.

299
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:45,510
But this is also my last season of trying, trying harding off stream to try and get it because I wasted so much time trying to get it for this season because I was like, Ooh, shiny badge.

300
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:52,590
No, I don't even get a paycheck at the, cause I do it off stream.

301
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,770
I do.

302
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,910
That's the worst part.

303
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:01,710
I could have fucking, I could have streamed 14 hours a day of that session.

304
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,790
I could have done that, but instead I did it all off stream.

305
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,390
So I don't even get paid for it.

306
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:19,130
And now I'm back here to do it after, after unsuccessfully getting it.

307
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:19,470
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,350
I've been drinking guys.

309
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,250
I should be specific that I am most definitely not sober right now.

310
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,670
I should be more specific.

311
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,790
I should like, um, let me fix my title real quick.

312
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,170
Not sober.

313
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,670
Not okay.

314
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,710
Um, okay.

315
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,930
Not so, not sober.

316
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,930
There we go.

317
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,170
There's no drops by the way.

318
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,190
I'm lying on the side.

319
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,370
I'm not gonna remove it.

320
00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:05,330
Um, um, uh, but yeah, so that's why I'm back here after like crawling to my bed in defeat.

321
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:13,130
I, like rivals decide to like fucking kick the dead puppy that's lying on the floor.

322
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,810
That's a wrap.

323
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,130
I still have to do two and a half.

324
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,630
I don't even get a chance to like, you know, what's it called?

325
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,570
What's that word called?

326
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:38,650
Like, um, when you're like, uh, processing everything and like, uh, what's that word called when you're trying to process everything that happened and just be like, it's all right.

327
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,910
It's okay.

328
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,090
Decompress.

329
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,390
No, no, not, not disassociate.

330
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:49,170
I don't know if decompress is the right word, but like, um, oh my God.

331
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,870
Grieve.

332
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,350
No, no, that's not, that's not coping.

333
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,050
I am not coping.

334
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,630
I'm not coping.

335
00:25:59,630 --> 00:25:59,630
Crazy.

336
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,230
Thank you for the 200 bitties.

337
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,690
Thank you.

338
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,430
Thank you.

339
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:10,930
I guess like process, process, like the defeat and like going through, I haven't even gone through the five stages of grief yet.

340
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:17,970
I'm just, I, I, drinking is definitely not part of, I'm not at the recovery phase yet.

341
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:24,330
Like, I'm literally, like, I just got put back into the, the ocean and be like, swim.

342
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,050
I'm like, okay.

343
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,950
Trick, yeah, I'm at stage zero.

344
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,190
I'm still at stage zero.

345
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,530
I haven't like processed anything.

346
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,250
Like, like I'm still in denial stage at the moment.

347
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:50,850
I am the streamer that, that like is, is going through it right now.

348
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:56,150
Um, anyway, so like, yeah, that's why I'm here right now.

349
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:03,250
Um, but like, I will still be streaming Marble Rivals, but I will be doing, streaming my rank grinds now.

350
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:09,170
I won't be doing, I most likely will not be doing my rank grinds off stream anymore.

351
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,930
If I am, it's basically me.

352
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,090
I can't fucking talk.

353
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,250
It's mostly just talking, not talking.

354
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:16,850
Oh my God.

355
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,030
Sorry.

356
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,870
I can't word right now.

357
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,630
It's mostly just like hanging out with my friends.

358
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,950
Um, if they want to play, if they want to duo, oh wait, it's only duo queue.

359
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,490
Sorry, I forgot.

360
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,870
Apparently next season is duo, trio queue only.

361
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,670
Oh, sorry, not duo.

362
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,030
Duo, solo queue only when you're eternity.

363
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:37,750
So most, if I'm like streaming rank off stream, it's mostly, I just want to hang out with some friends and duo queue or some shit.

364
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:43,150
Um, and like, I don't really want to sometimes like, you know, I want to chill and hang out with people.

365
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,850
Um, but other than that, majority of the rank sessions for Marvel Rivals will now be streamed here.

366
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:54,590
Uh, well, it's always been streamed here, but majority of them will be like streamed now instead of playing off stream.

367
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,170
And it'll be much more casual.

368
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:06,010
So like, as in like, if I get eternity slash top 500, I just happen to like, just get it.

369
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,450
It's not like I'm trying for it or any, in any way.

370
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:14,090
It's just more so I play, I just play the game and I still need to get, I need to get my quota hours still.

371
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,030
So that's all right.

372
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,870
Um, so as long as like, you know, I'm just there for the, uh, just to get the hours in.

373
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,070
Uh, but yeah, that's basically it.

374
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,650
Uh, I'll still be streaming Rivals.

375
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,810
I'll still be playing rank on stream.

376
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,910
Um, I just won't be like, I won't be like, be like, I have to end top 500.

377
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:33,650
Sorry guys.

378
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,250
I'm won't be streaming for a bit.

379
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,150
Cause I'll be playing Marvel Rivals.

380
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,170
Like that won't be happening anymore.

381
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,890
Um, because like, I have an actual problem.

382
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,170
I, I really do.

383
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:51,850
I, I'm just incredibly, I'm incredibly addicted to seeing numbers go up.

384
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,070
Like it's like in the competitive setting.

385
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:04,950
I don't know why it's just for some reason, like, like it's like one of the ways that I like, I like, it's like happiness levels go up.

386
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,090
Like my serotonin levels be like skyrocketed.

387
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:16,130
I'm like, I must watch my, I must watch my rank points go up.

388
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,890
The only way to make a bird happy.

389
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,450
Well, not the only way, but like in a competitive sense, I'm just an incredibly competitive person.

390
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,210
And it honestly is like, it's just incredibly, it's just addicting.

391
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,710
It's so fucking addicting.

392
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,610
Um, um, Edison, thank you for the 25 gifted subs.

393
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,010
Thank you.

394
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,690
Thank you.

395
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,770
I really appreciate it.

396
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,550
Thank you so much.

397
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:35,790
Yeah.

398
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,750
It's, it's been like that in Splatoon.

399
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,550
It's been like that for Overwatch.

400
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,910
It's been like that for Apex.

401
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:50,230
And now we're in the Marvel rival stage, um, of like, just trying to have BS, like trying to get top 500.

402
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,690
Cause I like being like, you know, best in the world type deal.

403
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,830
Um, hey guys.

404
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,290
Okay.

405
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,770
That's, I killed like 30 minutes.

406
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,370
Nice.

407
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,730
Okay.

408
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,690
Two hours left.

409
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,670
Nice guys.

410
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,530
Now I just have two hours left.

411
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,290
We did it guys.

412
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,690
It's just that easy.

413
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,150
All right.

414
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,430
All right.

415
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,130
Let me pull up.

416
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,090
Let me finally pull up the game.

417
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:22,990
Marvel Rivals.

418
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,450
Marvel Rivals.

419
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:35,970
Um, I heard there's going to be like, I guess, I don't know when the actual season two patch officially comes out.

420
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,950
Um, but I hate the new map.

421
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,790
Um, wait, actually, it's a new map.

422
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,430
Wait, maybe I can show you guys what the new map looks like.

423
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,510
I hate it.

424
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,350
I hate the new map so much.

425
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,430
It's actually like, wait, okay.

426
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:49,770
Sorry.

427
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,490
I'll show you guys the new map real quick.

428
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,270
I think, I think the server is still up.

429
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:00,170
Let me check, double check if I can boot up the test servers for it.

430
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,050
Um, it's not because, it's not just because I hate mutants, guys.

431
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,490
Okay.

432
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,710
My hate is justifiable.

433
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,650
The moment you see Karkoa, or where the fuck they want to call themselves.

434
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,810
Sorry, I'm not sober right now.

435
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:29,690
Um, but, but like, the map fucking sucks.

436
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:37,590
It actually, whoa, whoa, she 100% hate.

437
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,630
Guys, guys, it's not, not just that.

438
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,030
Okay.

439
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,830
My hate is justifiable.

440
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:55,170
My, my hate is incredibly justifiable.

441
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,990
Yeah, mutie scum.

442
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:05,890
All I'm saying is that, why do they need an island all to themselves?

443
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,590
Why don't you try to integrate into society?

444
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,610
You don't need an island all to yourself.

445
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,690
Okay, let's see, logging in.

446
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,050
I'm gonna check if the servers are still up.

447
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,730
Clearly, they didn't try hard enough.

448
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,070
Okay, all right, this is the test servers.

449
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:35,810
I'll show you guys.

450
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:45,270
Okay, so for those who've never if the William, if William Stryker had an alt account, was a VTuber.

451
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,030
All right, I'll show you guys.

452
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,370
Okay, um, custom game.

453
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,930
Okay, create.

454
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,450
I'll just create it just for myself.

455
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:58,250
Uh, invitation only, no spectating.

456
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,970
Okay, lock room.

457
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,190
All right, come.

458
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,310
Okay, actually, just do invitation only.

459
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,490
Okay, so where is it?

460
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,670
Where's Karkoa?

461
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,470
Karkoa?

462
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,430
Hellfire.

463
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,090
Okay, Karkoa.

464
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:10,910
Okay, there they are.

465
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,130
Okay, I'll show you guys why I hate this map.

466
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:18,930
Oh, donations go to Sentinel Protection.

467
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:24,490
Hey, Sentinels got first place in the official MRC tournament.

468
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,630
So like, am I truly the bad guy here?

469
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,470
Like, why did, why did rivals let them give me first place?

470
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:36,910
Maybe their ideals are not that... maybe their ideals were true all along.

471
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:50,270
I'm just saying, if they were truly a bad, if they're truly bad people, how come they won first place in the MRC?

472
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:50,990
Huh?

473
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,090
And Valorant too, huh?

474
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,450
Does that mean, does that mean Marvel rivals hate, hate mutants?

475
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,350
Huh?

476
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,530
Why would they let them?

477
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,010
Okay, let me show you guys why.

478
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:04,370
Why?

479
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,810
Oh my gosh, why is the sense?

480
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,410
Uh, keyboard.

481
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,190
That's not my sense.

482
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,330
1.83.

483
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,310
There we go.

484
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,010
And then, where's my melee?

485
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,170
Uh...

486
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,770
Wait, all heroes.

487
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:22,350
Confirm.

488
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,830
Okay.

489
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,770
And then, there we go.

490
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,690
All right, I'll show you guys.

491
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,270
I'll show you guys.

492
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,870
She's talking.

493
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,430
I'll show you guys why I hate this fucking map.

494
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,990
All right, so like, so okay, where's the point you might ask?

495
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,270
It's over there.

496
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,850
Now, how can you get to point?

497
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:41,630
Oh, don't worry.

498
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,630
There's multiple ways to get to the point.

499
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,710
Oh, don't worry.

500
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,230
If you get lost, you get lost.

501
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:50,190
But look, there's a passageway right over here.

502
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,130
Whoa!

503
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,030
And then, you get to the point from here.

504
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,690
Or, you can go over here.

505
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,990
And then, you can get to the point from here.

506
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,970
Or, you can run all the way.

507
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,190
You can... Oh my god.

508
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,230
Look at all... Look at how big this map is.

509
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,550
Where's a health pack here too?

510
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:13,790
Whoa!

511
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,350
Where am I going?

512
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,650
Oh my god.

513
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,430
Oh my god.

514
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,630
And then, the point's over...

515
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,510
Oh, is that it?

516
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,330
No, there's a right side too, guys.

517
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,850
Is it?

518
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,610
So like, you gotta... There's so... Oh my... And then, you go down here.

519
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,090
Oh my god.

520
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,410
So like, you go here.

521
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,190
And then, you could go... And down here.

522
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,930
And then, go down here.

523
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,030
And then, you'd be like, what do I do down here?

524
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,850
Oh, good thing you asked.

525
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:49,950
Boom!

526
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,030
Boom!

527
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,230
But I could also be like, boom!

528
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,410
Right?

529
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,510
And then, they're like, oh, it's just one portal, right?

530
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,770
Oh, and then, I could jump here.

531
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,570
Oh, you see these portals?

532
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,390
And then, I could go from here to here.

533
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,530
And bro, the high elobies are gonna be so fucking bad.

534
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:17,990
I hate it.

535
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,050
Not bad, but like, I'll hate it.

536
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:36,930
And then, when you cap the point, you'd be like, okay, so like... And then, oh, by the way, you can also come down from here and be like... And then, come over here and flank the people on that side.

537
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:46,070
And... And also, or you can go from here and flank here.

538
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:53,170
Or you can, you know, or you could go here, and if you're a flyer, you can flank here and be like...

539
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:59,810
But Doki, it's one portal, right?

540
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,090
No, it's not just one portal.

541
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:22,470
No, guys, it's not just one portal, because the moment this fucking point hits 50%, we're gonna have more problems here.

542
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,570
We're gonna have so many problems.

543
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:31,070
Oh, look at that, the portal is opening.

544
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,850
Oh, wow, where is this gonna take me?

545
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,650
So, let me take this portal.

546
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,590
Look where I am.

547
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,450
Wow, where am I, you might ask?

548
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,390
I'm behind them.

549
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,540
And then, you'll be thinking, oh, that's it, right?

550
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,920
Oh, no, no, no, because if I...

551
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:12,900
If I go back to spawn right now, there is a portal from spawn, and if I take the portal from spawn, I am at the point.

552
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,640
Oh,

553
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,990
you think that's all the portals?

554
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,810
No, no, no.

555
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,510
Also, there's a flanking cave right here for some fucking reason.

556
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,130
There's more on the other side.

557
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:29,890
There's...

558
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,230
There's more portals on the other side.

559
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,770
Why is there more?

560
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,570
How is there... How is there more?

561
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,570
Alright, I love how this part... Also, I tested it out.

562
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,430
Um, tech... Okay, this is pretty funny, but like...

563
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,970
If you're Ironman, um...

564
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,590
Oh, man, I'll show it to you guys later, but like... Okay, I'll show you.

565
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,770
Okay, so...

566
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,230
Um...

567
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:08,510
I tested it out, but it's really funny, because you can, like, ult here, and it'll hit an invisible wall.

568
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:15,470
Because you see, like, oh, it travels really fast, but there's an invisible wall, because the point is, like, literally right here somewhere.

569
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,870
It's, like, right here.

570
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,770
And, like, if there's no invisible wall, I cannot... You could kill somebody from here.

571
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:27,930
But there's an invisible wall that hit that stops the thing from right here, which sucks, because I thought it'd be really funny.

572
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,490
Okay, hey, you see that portal?

573
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,990
That goes straight to point.

574
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,230
That goes straight to point.

575
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,470
Okay, so you know where the point is?

576
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,590
The point...

577
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,050
is...

578
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:47,650
right...

579
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,390
Oh my god, it's so fucking stupid.

580
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,930
The point is right here.

581
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:54,010
It's on the side, because, like, you know why this is so stupid?

582
00:39:54,390 --> 00:40:03,110
Because, like, if you, like, go from spawn, if you start from spawn to there, it's not directly center.

583
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,930
It's, like, it's so weird.

584
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,830
Like, you... this is spawn, right?

585
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,750
You go straight, and then you turn right.

586
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,550
It's so...

587
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,450
It's so weird.

588
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,510
Like, you go here, and then you turn right.

589
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,190
It's not even in this.

590
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,610
Also, I just realized there's a dragon.

591
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,870
Also, this dragon blocks shots, by the way.

592
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:35,730
Like, like, you can body, like, imagine if you line up... the dragon goes away, by the way.

593
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:44,250
Imagine if you line up the perfect shot somewhere, like, if you're a mag, and then the dragon fucking flies.

594
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:50,490
Because you don't know when he comes back.

595
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,050
You don't know when he comes back.

596
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,690
Imagine if you're, like, whoa.

597
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,110
Like, it... like, look, he... look, he blocks it.

598
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,930
When does he come back?

599
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,130
Imagine you're, like, boom, but you have the killing shot.

600
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,250
It's definitely happening.

601
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,770
It's not my problem, because I'm a support, but I get it.

602
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,710
I don't know when he goes away, though.

603
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,270
Like, I already hate him.

604
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,050
Okay, so there's a lot of portals here, too.

605
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,790
There's one over here.

606
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,310
Get out!

607
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,110
Leave!

608
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:39,110
Okay, so, like, you line up the perfect shot, and then you press Q.

609
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,150
Get your strange portal hit away.

610
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,910
God, I wish.

611
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,670
Where is this area?

612
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,070
Can I fly there?

613
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:48,950
No, I can't.

614
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:53,050
Okay, when does he... the thing is, I don't know when he comes back.

615
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,890
Oh, yeah, you just do maximum pulse, and then he shows up.

616
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:57,910
Like, imagine that.

617
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,150
You have three people lined up right there.

618
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,250
Let's go.

619
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,750
That's 100% gonna happen.

620
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,770
I could feel it.

621
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,750
But here's all the flanking areas.

622
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:24,670
All right, so I would imagine your perfect 6k gets cockblocked by a fucking dragon that just flies in.

623
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,310
But there's a lot of flanking spots.

624
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,430
Sounds like it.

625
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:33,330
Like, I'm pretty sure someone's gonna time it, but who the fuck is gonna time the dragon?

626
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,350
It's not just Iron Man.

627
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,790
It's, like, all, like, you know, like, Magneto, all stuff like that.

628
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:43,690
Oh, yeah, that's my melee.

629
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,030
Like, I'm already lost, but I know I won't get lost when I actually play the game.

630
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,530
But, like, it's so big.

631
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,350
It's such a...

632
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,910
It's such a big map.

633
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,690
Like, I... like, there's so many portals.

634
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,950
There's a portal here.

635
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:56,930
There's...

636
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,090
There's a portal everywhere.

637
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,070
There's so many.

638
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:02,930
All right.

639
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,970
All right, so here I'm capping the point.

640
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,010
I'm capping it.

641
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,610
I wish we get, like, the other side.

642
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,270
Okay, we'll wait for 50%.

643
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:19,310
We'll wait for 50% until... Yeah, like, so there's another... God, I'm stupid.

644
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,590
Get out.

645
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:21,830
Get out.

646
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,490
Okay, so there's a portal here, too.

647
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,570
There's, like, there's so many portals.

648
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,650
Like, I don't even remember where all the portals are.

649
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,530
Like, there's too many.

650
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,730
There's another... There's a portal here.

651
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,490
There's one over here.

652
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,390
There's, like, I think at least five portals around that goes to unique places.

653
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,110
Um, there's one over here.

654
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:42,710
I remember.

655
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:43,530
Wait, was it here?

656
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,770
Yeah, there's one over here.

657
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:45,550
There's...

658
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,510
There's one over here.

659
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:48,790
And...

660
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,190
And there's... There's this one here.

661
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,850
I don't know where this one... Where does this go?

662
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,610
Oh, this one goes to the point.

663
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,370
Okay, so you take this portal.

664
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,030
You go back here.

665
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,170
And then there's, like, high ground.

666
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,150
There's, like, high ground portal right here.

667
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,570
So you take this portal.

668
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,670
You go to the side.

669
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,550
And then...

670
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,370
You gotta remember where... And then, um...

671
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,550
There's... Oh, fuck.

672
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,870
Okay, I don't remember all the portals.

673
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,090
And...

674
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,230
There's too many.

675
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,250
I'm so... I've already lost.

676
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,230
I'm so...

677
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,170
I'm getting fucking lost.

678
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,690
Okay, I've never been so lost in my life.

679
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,890
And then, where's that?

680
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,110
Okay, there's one over here.

681
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,950
There's one that spawned.

682
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,430
The one that from spawned is, like, here.

683
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,490
So you can go here and come back, too.

684
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:44,110
But when the map needs a mini-map, I just hate the stupid fucking dragon that caught...

685
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,610
I was like, I hate this stupid dragon.

686
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,870
It's like, he just comes in!

687
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,470
What if I have a kill shot right here?!

688
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,210
The perfect timing.

689
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:02,550
Um...

690
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,630
But yeah, the third one is okay.

691
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,510
I would admit the third map...

692
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,690
The third mini... The third map for this stage is all right.

693
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,090
It's the best out of the three.

694
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,990
Gracoa is on the third map.

695
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:16,930
It's on the third side.

696
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,290
I have to, like, uh...

697
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,390
Wait, let me see if I can get... I can...

698
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,270
It's a grove.

699
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,570
You can find Gracoa on... in the grove.

700
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,350
Everything.

701
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:37,370
Oh, at least they're removing some shitty maps.

702
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,230
I'm gonna make Miss Irisa, but, like, I hate the Spider-Man map.

703
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:41,530
Okay.

704
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,150
I'll... I'll show you guys the...

705
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,650
I'll show you guys the third map.

706
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,890
Or villain, I'm not judging.

707
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,430
Okay.

708
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,570
Um, I think, like, I can... can I get it from here?

709
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,950
Okay, that's central Gracoa.

710
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,170
I need the grove.

711
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,050
All right.

712
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:00,710
I need them.

713
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,870
I needed to... wait, it's control.

714
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,310
Okay, control Gracoa.

715
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,870
I didn't... it needs to be the grove.

716
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,210
The grove is, like, the actual...

717
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,470
um, the map that... for the third point.

718
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,250
Because it's all random, by the way.

719
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,150
The stages are all random.

720
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,320
I like you guys see this info.

721
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,200
Is this the grove?

722
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,660
Oh shit, it is.

723
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,900
Okay, this is the third one.

724
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,300
Okay, so this is... this is the one where you can talk to Gracoa.

725
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,400
Um, I'm pretty sure, right?

726
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:38,780
Yeah.

727
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,440
I think... I'm pretty sure the Gracoa is the talking tree, right?

728
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,020
The giant tree with a face.

729
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:46,940
Um...

730
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,280
No, it's all randomized because it's domination.

731
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,200
So it's all, like, random.

732
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,760
You don't know what you're gonna fucking get.

733
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,500
Okay, that's... I didn't really know who the fucking crow is.

734
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,580
I just, like, saw a giant talking tree and I assumed that's him or her.

735
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,820
All right, so...

736
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,120
This one is the least complicated one out of all of them because it's in the center.

737
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:15,740
It's... it's actually... and it's, like, more open so you can see where everything is.

738
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,500
So you can see where every... everyone's gonna come.

739
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,660
It's the least complicated one.

740
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,840
The only one I didn't... the only issue I didn't like is the waterfall.

741
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,620
I don't like, like... Okay, so there's a secret portal at the waterfall.

742
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,140
So there's one here.

743
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,240
And then there's, like, one here.

744
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,220
You can be, like...

745
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:42,940
You can take this... if you take this portal, you'd be over... Okay, so one of my friends said something really interesting.

746
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,820
And what they say is that... Okay, so...

747
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,620
You can play as Namor.

748
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,500
And you... you flank people from here as Namor.

749
00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:00,320
And then you, like... basically, you're, like, throwing your stupid fucking squids up here as Namor because you can see them.

750
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,900
You can sort of... you can throw your stupid ass fucking squids from here.

751
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,020
Like, and then...

752
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,760
Um...

753
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,040
And then if they chase you from here, you could take your stupid ass fucking portal.

754
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,300
And then you'll be...

755
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,720
You'll be here.

756
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,480
And then if they... and then you'll be here and you can leave.

757
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,120
Or you...

758
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,020
You take your... or you lead them here.

759
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,240
You lead the enemy team here to try and kill you.

760
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,240
And then you take this portal.

761
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,840
And you get point.

762
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,920
And then you go... you get down from here.

763
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,420
And then you get point.

764
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,220
So it's like a fucking wild goose chase.

765
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,960
It's...

766
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,640
It's a... it's a fucking...

767
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,940
It's a wild goose.

768
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,240
Yeah, it's some Scooby-Doo shit.

769
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,320
Like, okay, and there's Krikoa right there.

770
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,320
There he is.

771
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,020
Fuck you.

772
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,700
Fuck you.

773
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,600
Why did you create this?

774
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,400
CrazyTalon, thank you for the 200 bitties.

775
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,400
Thank you, thank you.

776
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,220
Fuck you, too.

777
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,580
He is Krikoa.

778
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,440
He's gonna go so hard.

779
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,760
Um, let's see people actually say Krikakoda instead of Krikoa.

780
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,060
Many, uh, thank you for the 500 bitties.

781
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:21,860
Thank you, thank you.

782
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,460
I won't get political.

783
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,540
It's okay.

784
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,080
They're just...

785
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,320
Oh, and then there's another portal.

786
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,140
I am Krikoa.

787
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,440
Um, and I don't care.

788
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,160
This one is not as complicated.

789
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,520
The only... the only complication is...

790
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,480
the fucking waterfall.

791
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,980
And there's like the...

792
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,120
Um, there is the squid.

793
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,100
Oh, yeah, that's right.

794
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,580
There's no more... no meetings here.

795
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,600
No mee... meetings.

796
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,040
No meetings are allowed here.

797
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,640
No meetings.

798
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,700
All right.

799
00:49:59,100 --> 00:49:59,540
All right.

800
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,700
So yeah, that's why... this is actually the least complicated map out of all...

801
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:09,340
Out of all the maps I played for it, this is the least complicated one.

802
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,580
But I hate the portals.

803
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,040
I wish you can destroy them.

804
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:12,820
Like...

805
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,200
Like, I... I hate.

806
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,200
What about destroyables?

807
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,840
All right, I can destroy the trees.

808
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,840
That's right.

809
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,500
I can destroy it.

810
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,000
That's right, Krikoa.

811
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,960
Fuck your home.

812
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,980
What you gonna do about that?

813
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,260
That's right.

814
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,300
Nothing!

815
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,120
Also, like, um, you can sit on top some of the trees here.

816
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,560
Oh, wait, did I destroy it?

817
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,580
Oh shit.

818
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,460
Okay, that's good.

819
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,280
Oh, you can destroy the waterfall!

820
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,500
Okay, that's actually really good.

821
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,180
I didn't know that.

822
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,720
Okay, you can destroy the waterfall, but you can still hide behind here.

823
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,160
No, people are gonna destroy this area.

824
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,220
Okay, that's nice.

825
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,320
Okay, thank fucking god.

826
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,580
Maximum pulse!

827
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,140
Thank fucking god you could destroy that.

828
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,980
Um, all right, that's good.

829
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,520
That's good.

830
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,820
Okay, because I did not like... the waterfall was the one thing I didn't like the most on this side of the map.

831
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,480
So...

832
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,060
Oh, these are all the breakables.

833
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,540
I feel like when you cap the point...

834
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,580
you can...

835
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:21,500
um...

836
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,540
You can... you have to break this first, for sure.

837
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,680
I think that's usually... that's most of the breakable stuff.

838
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,600
All right, here's the portal.

839
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,920
Where does it take me?

840
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:31,960
Where am I?

841
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,300
Oh, back here.

842
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:33,780
Okay.

843
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,560
Oh, I'm back in spawn.

844
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:35,880
Whoops.

845
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,580
I took the spawn.

846
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,820
Okay, that portal...

847
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:39,780
is...

848
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,560
I think that portal.

849
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,780
I'm so lost.

850
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,520
I... which portal did I take?

851
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,240
Which...

852
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,920
Which portal did I take?

853
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,960
I'm so lost.

854
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh, the... the dragon leaves his purse for about 22.

855
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:01,600
Oh, man.

856
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,800
I can't wait to be like what the purse... like have some...

857
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,900
to have... to have someone time.

858
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:13,600
Imagine being a DPS player and yet the fucking time when the dragon comes back.

859
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,240
Thank you so much for being simpler.

860
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,120
It's a two second cooldown.

861
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,320
Um, so yeah, all right.

862
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,420
That's... that's basically it.

863
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,220
The new map.

864
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,140
I hate it.

865
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,360
That's all I can say.

866
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,880
I'm not a fan.

867
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,580
I'm pretty sure like...

868
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:37,120
the reason I don't like it a lot is that um, I am pretty sure the moment...

869
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,860
like the higher competitive people figure out this map, it's gonna be so frustrating.

870
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,840
Especially like the flankers.

871
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,720
I... I am not happy as a support player.

872
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,740
Having to deal with more possible flankers.

873
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,020
Like flank options.

874
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,420
I know I'm gonna get absolutely shit on.

875
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,420
By all the like the dive... the dive heroes trying to flank me.

876
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,500
I'm already having a incredibly tough time.

877
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,560
Wait, oh my god.

878
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:15,740
Okay.

879
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,720
I'll show you... I'll show you a clip of one of the games.

880
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,940
Oh, no, I played so many.

881
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,340
I don't know if I still have the clip.

882
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,360
Oh my god.

883
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:22,600
Fuck.

884
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,940
I don't know if I still have the history.

885
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,480
I played so many games guys.

886
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,740
It might not even exist anymore.

887
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,500
I'm so sad.

888
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,780
Okay, there was... I had... I was playing against a Spider-Man and Venom.

889
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:38,040
Um, during the fucked up rank session and it was absolutely a terrible time.

890
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,480
I don't know how like...

891
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:52,640
I don't know how like how I won that game because it was absolutely... how terrible.

892
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,980
Okay, if I... I'll see.

893
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,040
Let me see if I can find the replay.

894
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,540
I'm gonna open it up right now and see if I can find the replay.

895
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,840
Um, let's see.

896
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,340
I'm gonna see.

897
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,640
Okay, there's a lot of games.

898
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:11,940
Okay.

899
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,300
A lot of really terrible games.

900
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:24,280
Let's just... let's just say that there were... there were a lot of incredibly terrible games.

901
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:31,260
So, I don't know if I still have... I still have... I still have them.

902
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,540
Okay, I know exactly like...

903
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:34,880
All right.

904
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,540
I know exactly like, um...

905
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:40,640
Who the people were on the enemy team.

906
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,540
So, I'm gonna check.

907
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,080
I'm checking right now.

908
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,060
Because I was like, you have to watch this terrible fucking time I had.

909
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,160
Okay.

910
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,360
This is this one.

911
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,460
Okay, I know the...

912
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,140
Yeah, I know it was the, uh...

913
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,660
It's not this one.

914
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,980
Okay, you guys can't see it because... all right, I'll show you this.

915
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,360
Okay.

916
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,140
This was when I sort of gave up right here.

917
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,880
This was the moment where I gave up.

918
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,640
It got better though.

919
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,220
It got better.

920
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:26,820
It got better.

921
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,860
It got better.

922
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,460
It got better.

923
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:30,780
It got...

924
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,260
But...

925
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,040
It got better.

926
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:37,780
It got better.

927
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,260
But...

928
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,000
It took a lot for it to get better.

929
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,220
It took... let's just say that.

930
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,900
It took a while for it to get better.

931
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,980
But... but it got better.

932
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,700
It got... it got better.

933
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,960
I feel... I don't know if I feel better, but it did get better.

934
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,200
It did get better.

935
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,880
Okay, I think it's this.

936
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,540
Is it this one?

937
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:09,960
Uh...

938
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,380
Let me double check.

939
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:17,820
I know what... I know like the exact stage it is.

940
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,660
Oh my god.

941
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,100
I wish...

942
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,640
I wish I kept it.

943
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:21,580
I...

944
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,080
Fuck!

945
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,120
I wish... I wish I have...

946
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,000
the record of it.

947
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,900
Okay.

948
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:33,000
As long... if they're on Spider-Man, then I'm not showing it because I want to see if they're...

949
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,740
I want to see if I could find...

950
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,600
Oh, no!

951
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,480
Okay, we don't have... guys, I'm so sad, guys.

952
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,460
We don't... okay, but I can show you this though.

953
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,000
I'll show you this.

954
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,080
This is... this part was so fucked up for me.

955
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,100
This...

956
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,900
I'll show you this part.

957
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:50,960
I...

958
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:56,140
Okay, this is... okay, so this is me, right?

959
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,600
Okay, watch this, guys.

960
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:05,840
I don't have this Spider-Man Venom clip any... I don't have the Spider-Man Venom replay because I didn't think that... I wasn't thinking.

961
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,780
Okay, this is... this is me, right?

962
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,980
All right, so...

963
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,400
I'm ready though.

964
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,200
I'm ready.

965
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,500
All right, so watch... I won this game, by the way.

966
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,600
And then I was like, okay, I hear somebody behind me.

967
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,000
Okay.

968
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:24,360
And then I was like, okay, if anything happens to me, my Loki will copy me.

969
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:24,680
Yeah?

970
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,700
All right, here I am, son.

971
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,680
All right, I was like, okay.

972
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,540
And then I got whaled.

973
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,660
Okay, that's cool.

974
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,640
And then I got grabbed.

975
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,200
Okay, and then I...

976
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,120
And then I lived.

977
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,100
I...

978
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,600
Okay, I'll show it to you.

979
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,300
I'll show you guys the entire stage again.

980
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,480
Okay, it's right here.

981
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,160
All right, so I was like, all right, nice.

982
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:53,980
Clobbered.

983
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:54,760
There you go.

984
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,220
He punches directly at me.

985
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,940
I got whaled specifically.

986
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:58,440
Okay.

987
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,460
The Wolverine grabs me.

988
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,500
All right, and then I got frozen.

989
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,980
And then he tries to ult me.

990
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,900
And then missed.

991
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,800
He actually...

992
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:22,680
Tried to ult me after, but thank fucking god.

993
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,100
That he missed.

994
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,000
Somehow you found out and lived.

995
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:34,220
Straight up hate and shit.

996
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,380
But that...

997
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,760
That was like one of my experiences.

998
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,940
This is one of my rank experiences.

999
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,280
And then my Loki was like, holy fuck.

1000
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,280
How did you live?

1001
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,940
Our Loki even was like, NPC was like, wow, they really fucking hate you.

1002
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,320
The tank experience, but to a strategist.

1003
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,990
But yeah, that was...

1004
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,160
Um...

1005
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,180
That was like...

1006
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:13,100
That was one of my experiences, guys.

1007
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,040
You're a trooper.

1008
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,120
I survived though.

1009
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,880
I... I fucking lived somehow.

1010
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,220
But yeah.

1011
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,280
Um, unluckily...

1012
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,500
Unlucky that I don't have the record.

1013
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,420
Of... Oh man, I wish I do, guys.

1014
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,880
I actually... I really wish that I save the...

1015
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,980
Record for... Because like, you can't go back.

1016
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,800
Um, of the Spider-Man...

1017
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,820
The Spider-Man map.

1018
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,060
Because like, that shit was fucking crazy.

1019
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:43,840
Like...

1020
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,780
I was basically...

1021
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,840
Booped up everywhere.

1022
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,240
Like, I could not live at all.

1023
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,220
I'm so sad.

1024
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,380
Wait, also, I'll be right back.

1025
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,100
I need to refill.

1026
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,980
I'm gonna refill my water real quick, but I'll be right back, guys.

1027
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,560
I'm gonna refill my water.

1028
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,100
Okay, so I...

1029
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,260
I... I'm ready to actually play the game.

1030
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,540
All right, let's do some quick play and then I'll see how I feel.

1031
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,720
I'll see if I feel like, you know, terrorizing or not.

1032
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,400
I'll see if... I'll see how I feel, chat.

1033
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:16,380
We'll warm up with some quick play real fast, and then we'll see.

1034
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,140
So give me a sec.

1035
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,180
Let me...

1036
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:21,980
All right.

1037
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,460
Oh, hey, hello, T'Challa.

1038
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,080
T'Challa.

1039
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,900
I'm warming up with quick play.

1040
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,520
I always warm up with quick play, guys.

1041
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,860
Before anything.

1042
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,700
Okay, nice.

1043
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,440
All right.

1044
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:42,060
I wish... I do wish that...

1045
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,540
I... I... I wish I saved the VOD of that Spider-Man game.

1046
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,060
Um, I finished my Soju!

1047
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,180
Flora, thank you for the Twitch Prime!

1048
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,120
Thank you, thank you!

1049
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,440
Um, but yeah, it's done.

1050
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,540
I'm just gonna play cas... I'm gonna play ranked casually on stream.

1051
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:02,020
Like, most of my ranked session for... most of my ranked session for next season, season two, will be on stream.

1052
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,660
Um, I'll not... I won't be playing much off stream.

1053
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,340
Um, just because I need to get my quotas anyway.

1054
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:14,420
Also, like, I experimented with... I experimented with, like, uh...

1055
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,200
Raw input?

1056
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:16,940
I don't like it.

1057
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,340
I don't like raw... raw input.

1058
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,100
It's way too fucking slow for me, and I'm so used to, like... I'm so used to my...

1059
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,920
um, sense that, like, it messed me up so much.

1060
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,660
I personally don't like raw input, but I know, like, pro players love it.

1061
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,040
Just because, like, it's just more...

1062
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:35,240
like, to them, it's more accurate.

1063
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,440
But, like, I'm not pro, so, like, I don't care.

1064
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,440
I don't like it because it's way too slow, and I don't want to experiment.

1065
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,940
I don't want to experiment with sense... with my sense to find it.

1066
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,020
All right.

1067
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,360
Maybe it's the last barrier that's holding me back.

1068
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,240
I don't know, but it's not for me.

1069
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,200
I found out that it just wasn't for me.

1070
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:04,600
I don't know how to play Starlock on this map, honestly, but it's quick play, so it doesn't matter.

1071
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:09,220
I think, like, defense is, like, the worst for this map.

1072
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,300
Where are they going?

1073
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,060
Oh, are they... are they here?

1074
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,860
Oh, they're here.

1075
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,240
Hello.

1076
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:19,640
Hello.

1077
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,440
Oh, shit!

1078
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,680
Didn't even have to look at him.

1079
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,520
I didn't even look at him.

1080
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,440
Oh, shit.

1081
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,420
Wait, that's not fair.

1082
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,600
Wait, wait.

1083
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,640
Wait, that's not fair.

1084
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,840
Please, please, look!

1085
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,080
Oh my god!

1086
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:39,700
Okay.

1087
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:45,000
If you don't look at me, I was walking in a straight line.

1088
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,440
Oh, I see you, B!

1089
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,080
You have a DC?

1090
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,240
Yeah, I'm... I think he just doesn't want to play with this comp.

1091
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:54,980
He didn't want to play support.

1092
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:57,220
That's crazy.

1093
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:57,700
It's okay.

1094
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,940
I'm warming up, guys.

1095
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,580
I'm warming up.

1096
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,100
Our Loki's dead, but I'm warming up, guys.

1097
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,600
Jesus Christ.

1098
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:08,840
Like, what?

1099
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,920
Wait, they get two supports?

1100
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,460
Wait, that's unfair.

1101
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:15,700
Wait, they have...

1102
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,000
Oh!

1103
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:25,080
Wait, that's not... Wait, they get three supports in my quick play lobby?!

1104
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,100
Like, that's...

1105
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,300
That's so messed up.

1106
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,000
Why do they get three supports?

1107
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,180
Wait, that's illegal.

1108
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:38,340
I didn't go to quick play for people to have three fucking supports.

1109
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:39,200
Wait.

1110
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,200
They don't have a tank, though.

1111
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,240
We have two tanks with one...

1112
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:50,320
We have two tanks with zero supports, and then they have three DPS.

1113
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,600
They have a support per DPS.

1114
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,200
Like, they actually...

1115
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:59,000
They actually have a support per DPS.

1116
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,820
Like, what the fuck is that?

1117
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,960
Wait, that's illegal.

1118
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,380
They each have their own fucking pocket.

1119
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,960
Like, that's actually illegal.

1120
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,860
Like, what am I supposed to do in that scenario?

1121
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:15,540
Like, I'm...

1122
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,780
I'm literally just...

1123
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,820
Oh my god, hello.

1124
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,580
Hello, Ramone.

1125
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:23,180
Hello.

1126
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,700
Okay, guys, maybe I should play Rink.

1127
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,640
It'll be fine.

1128
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,600
Oh, yeah, if you solo... Okay, never mind.

1129
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:37,420
Okay, he's better than me.

1130
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,440
Wait, what killed me?

1131
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:40,900
What?

1132
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,440
I did not see.

1133
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,920
Okay, maybe I'm too drunk right now.

1134
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,340
I'm not.

1135
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,640
Oh, guys, I don't think I'm okay.

1136
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,440
Oh my god, we have two supports!

1137
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,480
Oh my... Okay, I'm okay now.

1138
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,580
I'm okay.

1139
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:52,880
I'm okay.

1140
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,220
Do I think there should be a roll cube?

1141
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,720
I don't think so.

1142
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,060
Oh my god, why do I only fight you?

1143
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,600
Why do I only fight you?

1144
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,420
Let me fucking see.

1145
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,720
Let me see.

1146
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,140
I swear to god, I have not seen the other DPS at all.

1147
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,940
I have not seen any other DPS except for this fucking...

1148
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,560
Oh my god, literally the first person I see...

1149
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,320
is him.

1150
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,040
There you go.

1151
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:25,840
See, look at that.

1152
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:26,760
If I...

1153
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,220
Look at that.

1154
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,500
I get to actually experience a different DPS player.

1155
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,300
And then I actually killed him.

1156
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:41,580
Okay, I'm like... I'm literally living off of health packs and I'm living off of health packs and like...

1157
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,960
just running around like a...

1158
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,040
like a headless chicken.

1159
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,240
Oh my god, bro, Nitro's just...

1160
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,120
Bro, actually, fuck off, bro.

1161
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,040
Like, it's not fair.

1162
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,040
It's actually not fair.

1163
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:58,820
I want to...

1164
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,560
I want to talk to the other...

1165
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,200
I want to talk... Oh shit.

1166
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,200
Where's my support?

1167
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,380
Like, where's my...

1168
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,020
Like, bro, we have one tank that's literally AF.

1169
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:17,840
Guys, this is...

1170
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:21,060
Alright, I'll play one more quick play and then I'll terrorize Rink.

1171
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:21,760
I can't.

1172
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,620
I can't.

1173
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:23,300
I ain't.

1174
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,380
I can't deal with this.

1175
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,380
Bro, let me fucking see somebody else, bro.

1176
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,540
Like, I don't care about you, bro.

1177
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,240
I actually do not...

1178
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,480
Okay, that's fine.

1179
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,660
That's actually fine.

1180
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,760
That's actually fine.

1181
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,240
You're such a fucker.

1182
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,120
You don't have ice.

1183
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,250
I know you don't have...

1184
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,360
You're such a fucker.

1185
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,460
You're the one that's... that's fucking right.

1186
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,320
There you go, I knew he was gonna die.

1187
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,300
Alright, there you go.

1188
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,880
Stop pocketing this fucker.

1189
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,800
There we go, he's dead.

1190
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:08,060
The evil is dead.

1191
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:10,880
I needed to kill that one Iceman.

1192
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,080
I need to kill Luna Snow to feel anything.

1193
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:24,240
What if I...

1194
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,200
That's right, I'm gonna crash your party.

1195
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,240
Evil.

1196
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:37,720
Evil.

1197
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,180
Bro, that was... wow, they were trying to have a...

1198
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,600
Oh my god, they were just trying to have a pro Loki.

1199
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,760
Why can't you heal me like one time, Loki?

1200
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,340
I don't under... bro, just heal me once.

1201
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,000
I sat in front of you.

1202
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:02,880
I actually sat in front of our Loki.

1203
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,440
Holy shit, it's actually crazy.

1204
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,220
Wait, this guy is actually purposely trying to kill me.

1205
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,740
Wait, that's fucking rude.

1206
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,480
Okay, if he's actually gonna try and...

1207
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,060
Uh, I don't know.

1208
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,160
I don't know what camp... I don't remember.

1209
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,520
I think it's Namor.

1210
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,400
I actually don't know how to use Namor, so I don't play Namor.

1211
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:32,880
What the fuck?

1212
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:35,840
Where's my turret?

1213
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,560
Wait, where did... where did my healer go?

1214
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,260
All right, so that was a quick play game.

1215
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,920
You are not sorry.

1216
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,160
This guy actually only went for me.

1217
01:09:52,260 --> 01:10:00,060
There was an entire fucking team and he wouldn't let me like, experience like... I actually have to like, play other characters.

1218
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:09,340
I have to play other characters to fucking run around.

1219
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,320
He is not sorry.

1220
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,360
I know he is not fucking sorry.

1221
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:22,920
Legit, he ran past... he ran past like, several people just to kill me.

1222
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,060
Like, what the fuck?

1223
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:30,420
Now I definitely... I'm terrorized.

1224
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:31,140
I'm playing Hella.

1225
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,140
I feel extra terrorizing now.

1226
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:40,120
I feel extra terrorizing now.

1227
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,380
That's crazy, I never had a quick play.

1228
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,780
That was so fucking weird.

1229
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,200
That was such a weird quick play.

1230
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,100
My team was so fucking weird.

1231
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,100
It was my team.

1232
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,860
Why was it my team?

1233
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,820
No, it's not enabled.

1234
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,260
My title is a lie.

1235
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,040
I'm sorry.

1236
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,200
Sorry.

1237
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,360
I should... I just got lazy.

1238
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,000
I forgot to remove it.

1239
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,880
No drops.

1240
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,460
I just forgot to change it.

1241
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,280
I didn't realize the drops were over.

1242
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,340
I forgot to change it.

1243
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,440
I just forgot.

1244
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,520
It's basically it.

1245
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:23,340
There you go.

1246
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,160
Now it's true.

1247
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,100
There's no drops.

1248
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,260
I feel extra just... I don't know if I'll hit anything because my aim is not there today.

1249
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,180
I crashed out a lot the last few days.

1250
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,740
So like I don't think my aim is here anymore.

1251
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,080
No drops, check.

1252
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,820
Yeah, I think it's tomorrow.

1253
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:45,500
I don't know.

1254
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,580
I don't know if it starts at midnight or if it starts tomorrow or seven hours.

1255
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:48,940
Yeah.

1256
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:53,480
I just don't... I'm gonna see how my aim is like.

1257
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,800
Just have an hour to kill.

1258
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,710
Okay, where am I?

1259
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:01,670
Okay, I...

1260
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:04,350
Sorry, I like legitimately forgot what my movesets were.

1261
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:05,210
I had to look down.

1262
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:08,090
I'm actually like not okay right now.

1263
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:12,670
I legitimately forgot what I can do.

1264
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,790
I'm so confused.

1265
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:19,070
There's a cooldown and I know there's a cooldown.

1266
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,970
Wait, where's my other...

1267
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:25,670
Jesus Christ.

1268
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:27,050
There you go.

1269
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:27,610
I saved you.

1270
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:28,090
I'm a hero.

1271
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,830
Oh my god, my aim is not okay right now.

1272
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:34,310
I actually am not okay right now.

1273
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:39,530
There you go.

1274
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:41,990
All right.

1275
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:46,150
At least I'm hitting shots guys.

1276
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:46,590
Look at that.

1277
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,210
Oh dink, dink, dink.

1278
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:49,850
I have to flank.

1279
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:51,230
There you go.

1280
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,030
I'm gonna go flank.

1281
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:53,310
Nice.

1282
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:53,810
Nice.

1283
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:55,810
My thing hit him.

1284
01:12:58,450 --> 01:12:59,490
Get out of here.

1285
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:00,890
Get out of here.

1286
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:05,430
Oh my...

1287
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:06,350
No, he's one.

1288
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:07,210
Oh, I got him.

1289
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,290
There we go.

1290
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:09,790
Ah, I missed.

1291
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:10,370
No!

1292
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:13,550
Not the way for my cooldown.

1293
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,550
Oh no.

1294
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:17,510
The fuck?

1295
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,570
Oh, what the... Get out of here.

1296
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:21,290
Get out.

1297
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,650
Yeah, leave.

1298
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:25,030
Okay, now I can... No!

1299
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:27,430
Sorry.

1300
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,250
I'm not okay.

1301
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,430
Why am I saying sorry?

1302
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:37,050
I don't know who I'm saying sorry to, but like I'm actually not okay right now.

1303
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,450
All right, I'm not okay at the moment.

1304
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:44,250
Wait, what?

1305
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:46,970
Oh my god, who fucking burned me that fast?

1306
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:48,710
That's actually crazy.

1307
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,370
I got burned so fucking fast.

1308
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:52,390
I was not paying attention.

1309
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:55,870
Oh wait, he's one.

1310
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:56,810
Nice.

1311
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:57,150
Okay.

1312
01:13:58,670 --> 01:13:59,230
Nice.

1313
01:13:59,350 --> 01:13:59,690
Goodbye.

1314
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:04,470
I love point-and-click adventure.

1315
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:06,410
It's so easy.

1316
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:11,390
I love when it's a point-and-click adventure, guys.

1317
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:12,590
I just have to...

1318
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:15,150
Wait, okay.

1319
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:17,070
I don't know what the flank area is for this.

1320
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,650
I don't play Hella as much.

1321
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,950
I don't play DPS as much.

1322
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,920
It sounds stupid.

1323
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,340
Holy fuck, how are you a real person?

1324
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,700
Oh shit, goodbye.

1325
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:49,000
It's fine, my team won.

1326
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,500
Oh my god.

1327
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,240
Okay, I tripped for a shift earlier.

1328
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,220
I was just messing about.

1329
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,260
How am I the most killed?

1330
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:03,120
I am not paying attention.

1331
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,900
Bro, I'm not even alive right now.

1332
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:11,380
Not a person.

1333
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,620
I'm not a person.

1334
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,920
We need more.

1335
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:21,240
Guys, I have another soju bottle, but like, I don't know if I want to drink one more bottle.

1336
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,460
This is drunk aim.

1337
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,900
I drank an entire bottle of soju.

1338
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,780
I have like one more bottle.

1339
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,660
And it's like...

1340
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,800
It's literally, it's soju.

1341
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,180
It's 12% alcohol and I drank an entire bottle.

1342
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,400
Wait, someone's 0-0?

1343
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,020
Holy fuck.

1344
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,620
I think it was somebody left.

1345
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,520
Somebody definitely left.

1346
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,720
I would not be- no, this is literally drunk aim.

1347
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,200
I'm messing up my buttons right now.

1348
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,860
I had to look down because I was like, what buttons do I have?

1349
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:12,020
I forgot like my fucking moveset.

1350
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,100
Alright.

1351
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,680
I need a flank, I think.

1352
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:24,040
Everything is like an I think right now because I don't remember how to actually properly play these characters.

1353
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,400
On the top of my head.

1354
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,960
I have to get high ground, I'm pretty sure.

1355
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,600
I've seen how they play.

1356
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,880
This is how they play frame against me.

1357
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:40,420
Okay, guys.

1358
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:47,700
Woo!

1359
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:53,740
Hey, guys.

1360
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:54,920
Hey, guys.

1361
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:57,660
Hey, guys.

1362
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:00,140
Woo!

1363
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,240
Oh, hey.

1364
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:01,740
Wait, wait, wait.

1365
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:02,420
I'm gonna die to this.

1366
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:02,860
Watch this.

1367
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:07,820
Okay.

1368
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:10,840
Okay, um, is he still there?

1369
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:16,240
No, my death.

1370
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,860
I wanted to die.

1371
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,400
Why did he deny me?

1372
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:26,160
Why did he deny me of what I wanted?

1373
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:32,140
Bro, bro, what is your awareness, actually?

1374
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,600
What is your awareness?

1375
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,320
Holy fuck.

1376
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:47,160
Oh my, that is absolutely embarrassing.

1377
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,560
That is so embarrassing.

1378
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:57,080
Alright, you're gonna get out of this and then...

1379
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,020
Oh, wait.

1380
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,840
Oh, there you go.

1381
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,940
I was like, nice.

1382
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,040
I still got this.

1383
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,300
I'm just saying.

1384
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,040
Okay, she's coming over.

1385
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:13,980
Yeah.

1386
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,560
Oh shit, hey.

1387
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,540
Do I even have to move?

1388
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:22,740
I feel like I don't even have to AD.

1389
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:23,980
I can just stand still.

1390
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:30,000
I mean, it is really mean to play Hella on quick play, but like...

1391
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,320
I don't care.

1392
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,500
Like, I absolutely don't care right now.

1393
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:37,340
I landed on a squirrel.

1394
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,940
I landed on a squirrel.

1395
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,260
It's about... exactly, it's about having fun.

1396
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:51,500
Guys, playing Hella in quick play is actually so fucked up.

1397
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,720
Because she's like one of the... she's literally... if you can aim, you can play Hella.

1398
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,780
It's like...

1399
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,020
It's like not... IMO, it's not that difficult.

1400
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,560
If you know how to shoot your gun.

1401
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,200
Really?

1402
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,440
Up there?

1403
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,680
Oh shit.

1404
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,840
Oh my god, where's my... hello.

1405
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:20,340
Thank you.

1406
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,120
Okay, I have my ult, but like... oh shit!

1407
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,000
No, he dashed away!

1408
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,600
He dashed away!

1409
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,600
It was one hit!

1410
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,440
No, they're real people.

1411
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:36,440
Don't worry.

1412
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,240
No, that... a real person would make... would ult like that.

1413
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,840
I just didn't have my own ult.

1414
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,560
If I had my ult, I... it would... I could have killed him.

1415
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,260
It would've been... oh my god, that was such a juicy ult play too, if I had it.

1416
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,120
If I had my ult there.

1417
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:56,120
That would've been so fucking fun to just threw my shit on it.

1418
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:58,220
Wait, what the fuck?

1419
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,060
What are you doing there?

1420
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,010
Like...

1421
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:01,820
Hello?

1422
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:04,340
Thank you.

1423
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,840
Wait, you got healed?

1424
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,180
That's illegal.

1425
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:09,540
Goodbye.

1426
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:09,920
Okay.

1427
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:11,020
Hello.

1428
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:21,700
You can kill him.

1429
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,380
It's just...

1430
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:25,120
You can kill this guy.

1431
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,660
Bro, if you don't kill him, I swear to god, where is he?

1432
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,660
Where... is he just running away?

1433
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,420
What is this Looney Tunes shit?

1434
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,160
What is this?

1435
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,580
He's just running away.

1436
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,320
This is bullying.

1437
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,240
Hella... yeah, hella is just easy mode.

1438
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:47,780
And see, you just freaking throw shit down.

1439
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:49,720
Hella.

1440
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:52,520
Check.

1441
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,200
Oh, yeah, I can check it.

1442
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,100
There's no way.

1443
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,800
See, they're real people.

1444
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,160
Boom.

1445
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,940
Like, I programmed a bot to get into my game just to glaze me.

1446
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,740
I bought a bot to fucking Q into my game.

1447
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,000
I need one more quick play.

1448
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,260
And then I'll do... okay, how about I do one ranked game?

1449
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,000
I'll do...

1450
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,260
I'll terrorize one ranked game.

1451
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,060
I don't know.

1452
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,940
Wait, actually, how much... how much more do I have?

1453
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,080
Oh my god, I still have an hour.

1454
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,680
Okay, I still... guys, I still have an hour.

1455
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,420
I still have an hour.

1456
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:33,800
Okay.

1457
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,460
All right, maybe two.

1458
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:37,940
Maybe two ranked games.

1459
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,460
Oh my god, people are gonna be so mad at me.

1460
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:40,740
I don't...

1461
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:45,060
Okay, one.

1462
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,540
Oh, no, I don't want to open.

1463
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:47,540
I don't want to open.

1464
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:48,700
Swap accounts.

1465
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,760
Guys, I don't feel like swapping accounts.

1466
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,900
I am not playing support.

1467
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:53,700
If I'm gonna be in support gel...

1468
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,120
What rank is it?

1469
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:55,800
It's eternity.

1470
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,000
It's eternity.

1471
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,160
It's high eternity.

1472
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,240
Well...

1473
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,600
Low... like, bottom high.

1474
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,340
Low... bottom high eternity.

1475
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,500
Let's just say that.

1476
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:07,340
It's...

1477
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,960
It's bottom high eternity.

1478
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,260
It's... it was high eternity.

1479
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:13,560
And...

1480
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,320
It was.

1481
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:22,800
Then I got incredibly unlucky.

1482
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,040
Now it's the bottom of the high eternity.

1483
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,540
No, I'm playing... it's quick play right now.

1484
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:33,740
I'm warming up, technically.

1485
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,760
I'm just gauging how... what my aim is like right now.

1486
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,740
I'm gauging my aim.

1487
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,940
Right now to see how fucked up I am.

1488
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:50,380
And the best way to see how fucked up I am is playing quick play on DPS.

1489
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:51,760
Playing Hella.

1490
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,780
This guy almost died.

1491
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:56,900
That's crazy.

1492
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,180
All right, how do you flank?

1493
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,120
It's here, right?

1494
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,000
Usually the Hella players would be right here.

1495
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:07,920
No, right?

1496
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:08,280
Is it?

1497
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,360
No, it's on the back side.

1498
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,660
They would go to the backs.

1499
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:11,480
I'm pretty sure.

1500
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,360
No, they'll go here.

1501
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,300
I don't remember, guys.

1502
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:19,820
It's fine.

1503
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,780
Oh, they blocked him.

1504
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:23,760
What?

1505
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,780
They blocked him.

1506
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,160
What?

1507
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:26,960
They body...

1508
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,640
They walled him.

1509
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:32,740
How am I supposed to shoot my... my... what am I... what is it?

1510
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,880
Dag... mini daggers?

1511
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,540
How do I shoot my mini daggers?

1512
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:38,380
Mini daggers if they just block them.

1513
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:40,500
What am I supposed to do?

1514
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,280
That's my entire job.

1515
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,020
I just go pew pew.

1516
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,140
All right, have we not won this fight yet?

1517
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,620
You guys killed like four people.

1518
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,200
Don't worry, I'm here now.

1519
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:53,680
I won't be doing much, but I'm here now.

1520
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:54,700
I killed him.

1521
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,820
I won't be doing much, but at least I'm here.

1522
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:02,380
Where are they?

1523
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,660
Oh.

1524
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,060
What?

1525
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:09,180
Oh, I didn't see him.

1526
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,440
Oh, oh my god, he blends in.

1527
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:14,700
The map is white.

1528
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,480
Okay, that's a good shot.

1529
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,360
That's actually a really good shot.

1530
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,960
But like, I was like, what?

1531
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:24,600
He actually blended in with the map.

1532
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,980
That's so smart.

1533
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:31,900
Oh, that's so smart because you can change your skin in the character select, right?

1534
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:37,180
So that you can actually like just... I realized you can actually just like change...

1535
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,280
Okay, this widow is actually really good.

1536
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:42,180
All right, let me think.

1537
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,120
What counters widow?

1538
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,500
This widow is actually really good, so I'm thinking.

1539
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,120
Also, it might be because I'm drunk as well.

1540
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,040
Maybe I'm not sober, so like I can't see things correctly.

1541
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,400
Whoa, hey, can I... can I have like one poke?

1542
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,100
Yeah.

1543
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:04,840
That's crazy!

1544
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,120
Holy shit!

1545
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,580
Did my Loki actually ignore me?

1546
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,860
Wait, that's insane.

1547
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,660
My Loki actually ignored me.

1548
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,500
Okay.

1549
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,860
Oh, I'm leaving that.

1550
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,820
That ult is actually pretty decent.

1551
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,260
Okay, I might have to swap characters.

1552
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:27,220
No, I forgot to break the window!

1553
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,600
Oh, that was a good shot from me.

1554
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,480
Oh, that's not fair!

1555
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,380
Stop getting healed!

1556
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,260
What the fuck?

1557
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:39,520
Oh no.

1558
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,040
Oh, fuck!

1559
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,160
He damage boosted.

1560
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,120
Not damage boosted, he like hit me in the middle.

1561
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,740
All right, that's fine.

1562
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:49,320
Wait, can I ult you all with this?

1563
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,420
No, it's fine.

1564
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:51,700
We win this.

1565
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,180
I don't need to ult this.

1566
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:55,660
Okay, I'll ult this.

1567
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:57,280
Hahaha!

1568
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,260
Okay, I'm gonna chase... whoa!

1569
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,260
He burned me so fast!

1570
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,800
All right, I'll swap.

1571
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,080
He actually...

1572
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,880
He actually burned me so fucking fast.

1573
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,480
All right.

1574
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,280
I forgot what counter is Widow.

1575
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,980
I don't have to deal with it.

1576
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,180
I don't have to actually deal with the Widow.

1577
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:26,140
I just position myself in a way where other people deal with the Widow for me.

1578
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:29,820
So I don't remember what counter is in.

1579
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,920
Okay, I don't think they see me here, right?

1580
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:36,760
What the fuck?

1581
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:43,580
Okay, this is not good for me.

1582
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,220
This is not good.

1583
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,060
How did he know?

1584
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,420
How did he... I was just like... I'm just gonna wait until I might cool down.

1585
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,500
I'm actually...

1586
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,740
Wait, how did he know?

1587
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,880
I was just chilling.

1588
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,240
America!

1589
01:26:59,240 --> 01:26:59,720
Yippee!

1590
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,140
All right, after this... Yeah, I'll play.

1591
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,600
I'll try to play ranked after this.

1592
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,300
All right, let's see.

1593
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,520
I just wanted to flank.

1594
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:10,780
I just...

1595
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:11,360
All right.

1596
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:13,920
Oh, wait.

1597
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:16,480
Oh my god, they're all like looking for me.

1598
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:18,400
I don't like that.

1599
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:21,460
How am I supposed to flank if they're all looking for me?

1600
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,140
That's better.

1601
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,580
Let's see.

1602
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,080
I mean, I don't want to sink right now.

1603
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,740
I actually... I don't want to sink.

1604
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,820
My god.

1605
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,080
Okay.

1606
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:43,400
All right.

1607
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,060
I have to sink, guys.

1608
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,220
I just wanna...

1609
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:53,240
I just wanna chill.

1610
01:27:58,690 --> 01:27:59,160
Hello.

1611
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,800
What the fuck?

1612
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,260
You guys are just like... ignoring me.

1613
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:10,660
It's funny.

1614
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,020
They're like...

1615
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,190
Bitch.

1616
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:19,430
Shut the fuck up.

1617
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:27,690
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1618
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:31,330
Like, actually, what is wrong?

1619
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:34,750
Oh my god, they double support ulted for me?

1620
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,370
Oh my god, you guys are so cringe.

1621
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:42,370
Bro.

1622
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:46,810
What is... They act... I feel like... I don't know, guys.

1623
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:49,410
That's actually crazy.

1624
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:55,090
That they, like, use so much resources to kill me there.

1625
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:57,670
That's actually crazy.

1626
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:01,930
I don't think they saw me.

1627
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:05,770
I'm trying to figure out where that widow is.

1628
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:12,670
There we go.

1629
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:14,830
I don't know where that widow is.

1630
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:18,430
I've just been trying... I was like, my entire mission is to kill the widow.

1631
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:19,810
I don't...

1632
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:24,710
That's the only thing I wanted to do.

1633
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:26,890
She's been running away from me.

1634
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:29,610
She's... All she's done... I've killed everybody.

1635
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:31,410
But the widow.

1636
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:34,870
No, this is quick play.

1637
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:35,870
This is not...

1638
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:38,590
This is not... Quick play has no SPMM.

1639
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:40,630
It's literally, like, a free-for-all.

1640
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:46,570
Like, I've been killing everything but the stupid fucking widow.

1641
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:51,370
Like, every other character I've, like, touched at least once.

1642
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:53,670
Okay.

1643
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:56,770
But they're, like, actually protecting her.

1644
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:57,370
It's crazy.

1645
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:01,590
Like, I... Like, that's so weird.

1646
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:08,770
They've actually, like, all they've done is just pocketed her.

1647
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:10,470
What?

1648
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:12,170
Where am I?

1649
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:15,250
Bro, what happened to me?

1650
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:16,270
I don't know where I am.

1651
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:18,390
Okay, I really need heals.

1652
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,310
Okay, thank you.

1653
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:22,050
Okay.

1654
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:27,110
I don't think... This is absolutely not winnable, but it's funny.

1655
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:33,450
Jesus Christ.

1656
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:34,910
Okay.

1657
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:38,470
I have no cooldowns, by the way.

1658
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:40,530
I think everybody's dead.

1659
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,370
What am I praying?

1660
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:44,150
No, 100%.

1661
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:45,390
I'm not okay right now.

1662
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:51,030
I'm just gonna farm on it.

1663
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:52,510
I'm not...

1664
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:55,570
Is the Soju hitting?

1665
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:56,630
Oh, absolutely.

1666
01:30:57,030 --> 01:31:00,170
This is, like... I am... I'm not thinking right now.

1667
01:31:00,230 --> 01:31:02,030
I'm just shooting because I can.

1668
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:07,610
I'm just shooting my gun because I can shoot my gun.

1669
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:12,990
I'm like...

1670
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:15,310
I'm like... I'm like... Because, like, how do people play this?

1671
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:17,130
How do people play DPS again?

1672
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:21,170
My brain not functioning very well.

1673
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:24,990
All right, one more.

1674
01:31:25,090 --> 01:31:25,910
What about one more, guys?

1675
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:28,310
Okay, but what about one more and then I'll terrorize?

1676
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:30,810
And then I'll do this.

1677
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:33,150
Just shooting my shot.

1678
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,550
And then I'll terrorize, rank.

1679
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:37,630
Just one... I swear, last one.

1680
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:39,290
Last quick play and then...

1681
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:41,130
And then we'll see how it goes.

1682
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:42,930
We'll see.

1683
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:46,410
We'll see where it takes me.

1684
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:50,710
All right.

1685
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:52,490
I don't wanna play.

1686
01:31:52,910 --> 01:31:54,550
I mean, Storm is fucking easy as hell.

1687
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:59,710
I'm just trying to do freaking things that are, like, in training right now.

1688
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:00,950
One way.

1689
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:02,710
All right, yeah.

1690
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:05,290
I mean, it's just an hour, right?

1691
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:06,870
Just one more hour.

1692
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:08,390
It should be fine, right guys?

1693
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:17,720
All right, I don't want to swap accounts, so I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna play on my main.

1694
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:26,380
I don't want to swap accounts, so good luck.

1695
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,080
Good luck to my team.

1696
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:30,940
Good luck.

1697
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:33,100
Don't worry.

1698
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,420
Things... Everything will be fine.

1699
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:41,320
It's either people are gonna lose top 500 today.

1700
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,880
Lose and gain top 500 because of my actions.

1701
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:46,640
Or...

1702
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:52,640
Or people are gonna lose or gain eternity because of my actions.

1703
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:56,060
So it's fine.

1704
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,260
It's one or the other.

1705
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:00,220
Okay.

1706
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,660
That's just nice.

1707
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:06,880
What the fuck?

1708
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:10,560
Okay, this guy is not real.

1709
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:14,220
This guy is absolutely not real.

1710
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,080
Okay, don't worry.

1711
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,340
I can literally just...

1712
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:25,660
Oh my... Storm fights are like so fucking stupid.

1713
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:28,380
Like, I hate doing... I hate storm fights.

1714
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,200
Like...

1715
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,300
Like, the thing is I am...

1716
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:38,180
I am like absolutely nerfed for storm fights because I don't have a descending down button.

1717
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,000
I...

1718
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:41,580
For those who don't know...

1719
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:49,460
I have to look down because... I have to look down because...

1720
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,780
Look, I have to look down.

1721
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:57,760
Because my... I need healing is my... my left control.

1722
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:01,420
I... I re... because I don't have... I used...

1723
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,480
Okay, I have to rebind.

1724
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:06,800
But I know I have to rebind it when Ultron comes out.

1725
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,780
I actually... I don't have it because I...

1726
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:18,880
Uh, the reason why I don't have it is because I was like...

1727
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,620
Why do I ever play a flying character?

1728
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:21,460
I'm a support player.

1729
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,240
Like...

1730
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:24,900
Get rid of this.

1731
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:25,560
Don't matter.

1732
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,000
Yo, fuck this thing, Janna.

1733
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:31,520
Okay.

1734
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:33,300
Wait, there was a... Wait, what?

1735
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:35,400
Okay, where was she?

1736
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:38,060
She was below me this entire time.

1737
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,880
The fuck you doing over there?

1738
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,040
This has been... Is this end of season quick play?

1739
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,440
Or is this quick play at 11?

1740
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:45,960
No.

1741
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,000
I never had quick play be like this.

1742
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:49,840
This wild before.

1743
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,060
Or is this just the drunk effect?

1744
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,420
I've been killing so much when I'm sober that I never realized what their people are like when I'm drunk.

1745
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,920
And I'm not like trying as hard.

1746
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,980
Is that why?

1747
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:08,040
It makes more sense though, not gonna lie.

1748
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:13,400
It definitely makes more sense.

1749
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,240
Just fly up.

1750
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:19,200
Like, you can't kill me if I'm like just flying up top.

1751
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:24,240
Yeah, but like...

1752
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:27,340
I've had... My quick play games have always been like decent.

1753
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:30,880
I've never had like such weird ass quick play before.

1754
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:42,080
I've never like... All my quick play games before this have never been so... Like I've had... All my games have been extremely wild.

1755
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:42,760
It's crazy.

1756
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:45,800
Ooh.

1757
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:46,920
All right.

1758
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,240
Okay.

1759
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:47,900
Okay, Doki.

1760
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:48,780
You can totally focus.

1761
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:53,700
You don't want... You don't want to lose games for in rank for these people.

1762
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:54,300
Actually, no.

1763
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,040
I can't control that.

1764
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:55,840
I can't make promises.

1765
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,120
I can't keep.

1766
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,620
No, I can't.

1767
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,760
I shouldn't be making promises I can't keep.

1768
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:10,980
Fuck this guy.

1769
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:13,220
I'm not gonna kill him, but like... Fuck him.

1770
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:13,920
Oh, I did.

1771
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:14,660
Cool.

1772
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:15,960
Hahahaha.

1773
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:19,940
I'll take it.

1774
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,200
Honestly, I'll take it.

1775
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:25,960
I'll take this.

1776
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,260
Can we like... Cap?

1777
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:40,930
I was like, it's fine.

1778
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:45,230
Yeah, yeah, fuck that rocket.

1779
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:47,430
Okay, fuck that rocket in particular.

1780
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:49,630
All right, let's see.

1781
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:51,350
Let's see what I want to play.

1782
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:55,290
Back to... I don't know what I want to play.

1783
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:57,890
I always wanted to learn, uh...

1784
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:01,510
Point and click adventure time.

1785
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:04,750
Point and click adventure time.

1786
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:05,870
Fuck that... Yeah, exactly.

1787
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:07,690
Fuck that one rocket in particular.

1788
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:09,190
You know what's up.

1789
01:37:10,170 --> 01:37:12,050
You know exactly what's up.

1790
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:15,710
I think the support player got tired of playing support.

1791
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:19,510
Where... Who did she up?

1792
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:25,610
I'll lead the guardians now.

1793
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:28,650
Oh, you're scared.

1794
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:29,570
You're so scared.

1795
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:33,470
Was that targeted?

1796
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:35,290
100%.

1797
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:38,130
I'm fine with that, honestly.

1798
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:44,230
That was targeted too.

1799
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:47,150
That was targeted as well.

1800
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:47,970
Okay.

1801
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:51,390
Seeking a target.

1802
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:58,890
Yeah, I just waited for the scarlet to finish flying so I could go pew, pew.

1803
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:02,090
Instant try karma.

1804
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:05,110
100%.

1805
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:08,550
I do not care.

1806
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:11,690
Come on, finish flying.

1807
01:38:11,830 --> 01:38:12,190
Finish flying.

1808
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,650
Finish flying.

1809
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:17,350
Wait, okay.

1810
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:22,510
Wait.

1811
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:23,070
Nice.

1812
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:24,450
Alright, finish flying.

1813
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:27,330
No, the update's not out.

1814
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:28,670
It's in seven hours.

1815
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:32,010
That's right, run.

1816
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:33,850
Run.

1817
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:35,790
Oh, I didn't even realize he was real.

1818
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:39,930
Uh, where did people go?

1819
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,510
Here, right?

1820
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:41,550
Yeah.

1821
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:43,070
Let me wait.

1822
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:46,090
Let me wait.

1823
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:47,070
I'm patient.

1824
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:50,490
Wait, he's on Spider-Man now.

1825
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:54,310
Wait, he's on the thing.

1826
01:38:54,490 --> 01:39:00,430
Wait, they have an actual- Wait, they- Wait, they went like almost 2-2-2 except for the rocket.

1827
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,050
Wait, that's silly.

1828
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:03,750
That's so silly.

1829
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:07,250
Wait, he went Namor?

1830
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:08,190
Really?

1831
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:10,160
He went Namor?

1832
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:16,110
They went Namor.

1833
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:18,530
Spider, okay.

1834
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:23,130
That's- That's funny.

1835
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:24,630
That's actually funny.

1836
01:39:25,970 --> 01:39:27,690
They actually went Namor-Spider.

1837
01:39:31,150 --> 01:39:32,990
He's trying to hook someone over.

1838
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:34,530
Me.

1839
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:37,310
The wrong person.

1840
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:44,390
The wrong person to hook over.

1841
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,810
Wait, I don't know about that, buddy.

1842
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:51,750
Oh my god.

1843
01:39:54,230 --> 01:39:55,490
No, fuck you in particular.

1844
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:58,290
Oh my god, you're such a nerd.

1845
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:00,150
You're actually such a nerd.

1846
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:02,830
Yeah, but you couldn't- Oh, wait, you saved him.

1847
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:05,430
Fucking nerd.

1848
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:08,310
Oh, wait.

1849
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:11,990
Oh, wait, he did- Oh, I thought he was gonna be on the ground.

1850
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:13,690
That's why I threw it on the ground.

1851
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:15,750
Oh, nice, nice, my Widow.

1852
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,230
Nice, go Widow, go!

1853
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:21,250
Yeah, I was like, why did you hook me?

1854
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:24,710
We can all fly, except for our Widow.

1855
01:40:26,570 --> 01:40:28,650
I mean, try to get the clip, at least.

1856
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:31,050
That's crazy.

1857
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:34,110
Their team's actually real.

1858
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:41,090
The only thing missing is like literally another support.

1859
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:46,250
They actually try to make a real person.

1860
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:50,350
Oh, that was too fast.

1861
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:51,990
Oh my god.

1862
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:55,090
I'm not meant to aim right now.

1863
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:58,470
Oh my god, I would have hit those.

1864
01:40:58,730 --> 01:41:00,350
Nice, she hit those for me.

1865
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:03,410
Okay, this is a hate crime.

1866
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:12,270
Why are both the- Wait, why are both the tanks there?

1867
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:16,250
This is a hate crime!

1868
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,170
Why are they both here?

1869
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:27,170
Everyone just wants me dead.

1870
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:30,870
Alright, quick play's a little special today.

1871
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:33,130
Like, this is weird.

1872
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,390
The LA is real.

1873
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:43,250
Alright, I'm done warming up on quick play, guys.

1874
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:44,230
I'm done.

1875
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:46,350
I'm done with quick play.

1876
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:47,710
Alright.

1877
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:51,850
Alright, let's terrorize.

1878
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:55,610
Let's terrorize rank, guys.

1879
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:57,650
Okay.

1880
01:41:58,510 --> 01:41:59,530
I'll do one game.

1881
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:01,310
If it's bad...

1882
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:02,250
Guys.

1883
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:07,290
If it's bad, we won't- We won't do another.

1884
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:09,770
I actually- I'll feel bad.

1885
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:12,050
I'll feel really bad.

1886
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:16,930
Like...

1887
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:17,570
Like...

1888
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,630
Okay, I won't feel bad.

1889
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:20,930
But I will- I have evidence.

1890
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:24,650
I have evidence that I was not sober for it.

1891
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:32,790
I haven't drank- I finished one bottle a while ago and I haven't drank since.

1892
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:33,410
Are they roleplaying?

1893
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:35,010
They're always roleplaying!

1894
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:37,510
This is my fucking...

1895
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:39,910
Deathmatch practice.

1896
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:41,630
Why are they always roleplaying?

1897
01:42:45,230 --> 01:42:46,130
Stop roleplaying.

1898
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:47,830
Fight now.

1899
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:50,030
Stop roleplaying.

1900
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:52,490
I require a fight.

1901
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:56,970
No, it won't be that long.

1902
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:59,950
Because everybody is trying to get last minute top 500.

1903
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:03,450
I hope- I assume it's not that long.

1904
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:04,870
Are you roleplaying?

1905
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:06,070
No.

1906
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:07,090
We're here to fight.

1907
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:10,550
Are you a roleplayer?

1908
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:10,870
Yeah.

1909
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:13,310
I kill all non-roleplayers.

1910
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:20,470
Get out of here.

1911
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:28,490
Alright, nice.

1912
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:31,270
Alright, am I terrorizing?

1913
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,830
Am I terrorizing?

1914
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:34,030
Oh, fuck.

1915
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:35,450
I should- Oh, man.

1916
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:36,750
Fuck.

1917
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:38,430
I'm gonna get on a list.

1918
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:46,730
Okay.

1919
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,210
Top 256?

1920
01:43:52,110 --> 01:43:52,870
I don't know.

1921
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:55,150
I feel a little embarrassed if I have that banner.

1922
01:43:56,410 --> 01:43:56,890
Alright.

1923
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:59,650
I can't mess up Luna, right?

1924
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:03,710
I just can't play Loki in my state.

1925
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:06,270
That's too- Loki is way too much thinking.

1926
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:10,850
That is too much thinking for me, right?

1927
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:14,050
I can't play Loki in my current state at the moment.

1928
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:16,710
That might be a little too much, guys.

1929
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:21,530
Also, Baka, thank you for the- Gifting a tier 1 sub.

1930
01:44:23,110 --> 01:44:24,890
Thank you, thank you.

1931
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:28,270
Alright, they can deal with the bans.

1932
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:30,510
Oh, I could just rocket.

1933
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:34,630
Wait, okay.

1934
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:37,650
If we win this game, I'll play Rocket.

1935
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:39,850
We have a Loki- Oh, wait, we don't have a Loki.

1936
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:45,570
I gotta prepare for next season, guys.

1937
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:47,090
Guys, guys, guys.

1938
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:50,670
We gotta prepare for next- Is no one banning anything?

1939
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:54,170
Okay, Wolverine.

1940
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:54,550
Okay.

1941
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:57,490
It'll be awkward if my name or thing went up.

1942
01:44:57,710 --> 01:44:59,210
I forgot we have a group.

1943
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:02,670
I just banned- I forgot I had a group.

1944
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:03,470
Guys, this is bad.

1945
01:45:03,690 --> 01:45:05,530
I almost fucked over the ban line.

1946
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:10,410
I didn't even register in my head that we have a group.

1947
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:11,990
Oh my god.

1948
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:14,630
I could have actually fucked over the ban line.

1949
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:18,650
Okay, if we win this...

1950
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:21,950
If we win this...

1951
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:26,690
I'll play Rocket next match.

1952
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:31,650
Cause then it's like I didn't gain or like- I didn't gain or lose any ELO.

1953
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:34,370
If we don't, it's over.

1954
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:37,950
I can give it to the Hela.

1955
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:39,750
Hela should get it.

1956
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:41,650
Oh my god, I'm not okay.

1957
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:44,590
Wait, we have a Spider-Man?

1958
01:45:44,590 --> 01:45:44,770
Oh man.

1959
01:45:47,950 --> 01:45:49,390
Okay, our Spider-Man gets this.

1960
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:50,890
Okay.

1961
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:53,770
By the way, you know the funniest thing?

1962
01:45:54,230 --> 01:45:58,090
Raccoon is banned on my- It's a banned word.

1963
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:04,870
Like, my moderators have to- It's a block term.

1964
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:08,050
So my moderators have to approve every time.

1965
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:13,050
Every time someone says raccoon, my moderators have to approve the message.

1966
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:18,970
The message does not show up unless it's approved.

1967
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:23,430
Oh, that Spider-Man is dead dead.

1968
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:26,950
Whoa, unless...

1969
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:30,090
Wait, he didn't even get the...

1970
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:33,660
Oh, this is not good.

1971
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:42,350
Oh, this is not good.

1972
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,930
The reload.

1973
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:53,570
Oh my god, oh my god.

1974
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:55,710
Don't worry, I got you.

1975
01:46:56,830 --> 01:46:58,050
Don't worry, I got you.

1976
01:46:58,750 --> 01:46:59,830
Don't worry, I got you.

1977
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,590
Can't get you forever, though.

1978
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:06,730
Oh, fuck.

1979
01:47:06,850 --> 01:47:07,870
Okay, we both did it.

1980
01:47:08,110 --> 01:47:08,910
Shit, that's unlucky.

1981
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:10,730
I got mine first.

1982
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:12,010
That's unlucky.

1983
01:47:12,150 --> 01:47:12,930
We both react.

1984
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:13,990
Guys, this is bad.

1985
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:22,830
Guys, it's not looking so good already.

1986
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:25,130
Guys, it's not looking so good already.

1987
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:27,490
We doubled support health.

1988
01:47:28,990 --> 01:47:31,230
I didn't see how many.

1989
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:32,630
I didn't see how many.

1990
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:34,210
Okay, but we still lived.

1991
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:39,670
Guys, that was...

1992
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:40,210
Guys, that was...

1993
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:41,210
That was not my fault.

1994
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:43,850
Guys, that was...

1995
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:46,150
That's not my fault.

1996
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:49,770
That's not my fault, guys.

1997
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:51,670
At least he's communicating.

1998
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:52,170
Good.

1999
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:54,450
Thank god someone is communicating for me.

2000
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:57,670
I was not gonna talk.

2001
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:05,320
Okay, I need to heal my team now.

2002
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:16,310
Oh, shit.

2003
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:16,790
What?

2004
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:19,810
Okay, I need to see this.

2005
01:48:19,810 --> 01:48:22,110
I got pulled into...

2006
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:22,870
Oh my god.

2007
01:48:23,410 --> 01:48:26,050
Oh, that is...

2008
01:48:26,050 --> 01:48:27,430
Oh, they're running...

2009
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:28,570
Oh my god.

2010
01:48:28,910 --> 01:48:32,770
We banned Adam and yet you're still running triple support?

2011
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,370
How desperate.

2012
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:36,790
How desperate are you for ELO right now?

2013
01:48:37,490 --> 01:48:38,450
Oh wait, it's end of season.

2014
01:48:38,710 --> 01:48:39,410
They're very desperate.

2015
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:40,170
JK.

2016
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:42,030
I forgot what ELO I'm in.

2017
01:48:46,650 --> 01:48:52,310
We literally banned Adam to prevent triple support and I forgot how... I almost forgot.

2018
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:55,350
These guys are close.

2019
01:48:58,370 --> 01:49:00,130
End of season, baby.

2020
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:03,190
End of season.

2021
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:05,230
I almost forgot right now.

2022
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:11,010
No, triple support against like in rank grinding in this ELO is for like...

2023
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:13,510
For Adam is like the true...

2024
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:17,650
It's for like...

2025
01:49:17,650 --> 01:49:18,370
You know...

2026
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:19,570
I need ELO.

2027
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:22,250
Cause it's like super...

2028
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:23,850
I got hit by something.

2029
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:24,810
I'm confused.

2030
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:28,270
My reflexes are not that fast right now so I'm like...

2031
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:29,270
What hit me?

2032
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:31,990
Legitimately like...

2033
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:32,870
Something hit me.

2034
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:34,830
Touched me right now.

2035
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:36,610
I can't tell.

2036
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:40,150
I didn't know again.

2037
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:45,290
I'm gonna let my invis build all...

2038
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:48,170
Oh, you know when they're actually tilted when no one's talking too?

2039
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:51,330
That's like the true special.

2040
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:54,370
Like no one's talking at all.

2041
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:57,370
Everyone is so quiet.

2042
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:00,730
Everyone is actually...

2043
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:02,610
Oh, okay.

2044
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:03,070
There we go.

2045
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:04,110
Oh my god.

2046
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:07,570
People are talking.

2047
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:13,570
I got you buddy.

2048
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:18,850
Okay, but where is Iza?

2049
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:26,690
Alright.

2050
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:31,490
Yeah, I did that.

2051
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:34,170
Yeah.

2052
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:36,270
Yeah.

2053
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:39,310
I might die though.

2054
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:39,930
Oh nice.

2055
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:40,490
Yeah.

2056
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,670
Yeah.

2057
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:46,990
Guys, these are top...

2058
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:48,790
Some of these players are top 500 players.

2059
01:50:52,590 --> 01:50:58,010
I love that rank is just a lottery of which player you get.

2060
01:50:58,990 --> 01:50:59,670
Yeah.

2061
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:03,090
Unknown is like high up there.

2062
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:06,830
100% yeah.

2063
01:51:08,530 --> 01:51:09,710
I'm not joking.

2064
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:14,410
I recognize the names of some of these people.

2065
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:17,790
I know one of them is like smurfing right now in my lobby though.

2066
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:27,520
I looked and he was gone.

2067
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:29,840
I looked and he was gone.

2068
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,020
He disappeared.

2069
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:37,750
Oh my god.

2070
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:39,790
I looked and...

2071
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:43,350
Jesus Christ.

2072
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:47,030
Please.

2073
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:49,570
Oh my god, he lives!

2074
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:50,390
You live!

2075
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:52,790
You live!

2076
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:57,810
Also weird, this guy, the weirdo guy is top 500 too.

2077
01:51:58,570 --> 01:51:59,670
Oh my god!

2078
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:00,930
Look at them go!

2079
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:04,050
Look at that, it's just that easy guys.

2080
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:07,070
I'm just that good I guess.

2081
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:08,570
Hahaha!

2082
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:11,490
I'll give the...

2083
01:52:11,490 --> 01:52:12,630
I'm just gonna give this to him.

2084
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:14,930
Zeno please pick me!

2085
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:15,970
Here we go.

2086
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:19,050
Is there somebody over there?

2087
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:24,170
I am rude.

2088
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:29,030
What was he looking at?

2089
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:30,050
Hahaha!

2090
01:52:30,170 --> 01:52:31,550
What was he looking at?

2091
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:32,470
I'm so confused.

2092
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,830
I'm letting my...

2093
01:52:34,830 --> 01:52:37,410
Okay, except I need to make sure he doesn't die.

2094
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:40,750
Okay, that's sad.

2095
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:47,870
Okay, we're doing this on purpose though.

2096
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:50,810
I didn't realize.

2097
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:52,510
That was my bad.

2098
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:56,970
That was my bad.

2099
01:52:57,910 --> 01:52:58,830
That was my bad.

2100
01:52:58,950 --> 01:53:00,730
I didn't realize he...

2101
01:53:00,730 --> 01:53:02,130
I was waiting for it.

2102
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:05,730
I'll be like, that was my bad.

2103
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:08,930
I thought we could just kill all of them.

2104
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:10,950
That was the last fight.

2105
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:12,750
In the mouth.

2106
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:23,690
With the double.

2107
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:28,090
Look, see?

2108
01:53:28,410 --> 01:53:29,550
Perfect excuse.

2109
01:53:29,710 --> 01:53:30,830
Also, I didn't think she...

2110
01:53:39,610 --> 01:53:42,070
Look, it's actually a strategy.

2111
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:44,870
It's a legit strategy.

2112
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:48,150
If you use double support on the last fight.

2113
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:52,070
You can actually kill all of them.

2114
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:56,830
Sorry.

2115
01:53:56,970 --> 01:53:58,110
Oh, I shouldn't tell them I'm drunk.

2116
01:53:58,470 --> 01:54:00,430
They'll be like...

2117
01:54:00,430 --> 01:54:02,570
Also saw you...

2118
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:05,930
I also sort of press tabbed.

2119
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:09,070
And saw you were at 80.

2120
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:10,710
80.

2121
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:14,090
So I didn't think you'd get it.

2122
01:54:21,870 --> 01:54:25,150
When the bucky went down.

2123
01:54:35,610 --> 01:54:36,250
Okay.

2124
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:36,770
Okay, look, see?

2125
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:38,290
Look.

2126
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:41,130
I had my excuses ready.

2127
01:54:41,530 --> 01:54:43,970
I had my excuses ready.

2128
01:54:45,850 --> 01:54:47,370
I'm not ready.

2129
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:51,110
I'll go with my group.

2130
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:53,010
Actually, I'll go with my mag.

2131
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:55,630
What?

2132
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:58,570
Who's behind?

2133
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,910
What the fuck are they doing?

2134
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:05,330
What the fuck?

2135
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:06,830
What killed me?

2136
01:55:07,770 --> 01:55:09,170
So confused.

2137
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:12,210
I have two AFK's.

2138
01:55:12,330 --> 01:55:13,310
Wait, we win?

2139
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:22,250
We win?

2140
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:23,190
Okay.

2141
01:55:23,890 --> 01:55:27,570
I didn't want to tell them that I'm like, not sober.

2142
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:29,930
Because I feel like they're gonna report me.

2143
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:32,150
Or like, they're gonna avoid me.

2144
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:34,150
And I don't want them to avoid me.

2145
01:55:34,350 --> 01:55:35,790
Because I don't want...

2146
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:37,270
I don't want...

2147
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:39,950
Like how they're like, I have slurs in my mouth right now.

2148
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:41,210
Like on the tip of my tongue.

2149
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:45,030
He would have slurred at me if I didn't say I'm sorry.

2150
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:52,350
I got slurred.

2151
01:55:52,630 --> 01:55:54,990
Not at a lot, but I heard a lot of slurs.

2152
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:03,810
Wait.

2153
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:06,350
Yeah, because I'm just saying.

2154
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:13,380
What?

2155
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:17,820
Same person who Luna also when we said nine times we're by the way.

2156
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,080
Grown women by the way.

2157
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:20,900
Oh, look at that.

2158
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:23,420
People are starting...

2159
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:26,560
See?

2160
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:31,120
This is more fun when like, you're not sober.

2161
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:34,060
This is 100% more fun when you're...

2162
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:36,580
But like...

2163
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:40,100
Like...

2164
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,320
I told you guys.

2165
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:43,820
This is...

2166
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:47,020
When you're not sober, it's much more fun.

2167
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:51,960
But...

2168
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:55,700
When I'm sober and I have to deal with this shit.

2169
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:58,460
It's actually miserable.

2170
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:00,600
It's so...

2171
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,720
It's so miserable.

2172
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:06,480
Like...

2173
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:11,460
It's not a good time.

2174
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:12,720
Don't worry.

2175
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:14,480
For real.

2176
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:15,280
For real.

2177
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:16,440
Like...

2178
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,500
See guys?

2179
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:21,540
They didn't say any slurs to me.

2180
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:23,340
Because I was like...

2181
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:25,120
I was like, sorry.

2182
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:26,820
My bad.

2183
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:28,860
I had a perfect excuse.

2184
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:30,780
I was like, it was last fight.

2185
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,740
I thought we could kill them all.

2186
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:33,900
With double support.

2187
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:36,420
With my damage.

2188
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:46,960
And then I was like, also I thought you wouldn't get it in time.

2189
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:50,540
No slur here.

2190
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,340
I mean, we can see how close they are.

2191
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:57,100
Alright guys.

2192
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:00,680
Let's see how close they were to...

2193
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,240
To top 500.

2194
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:03,400
Let's see.

2195
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,120
Alright.

2196
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:10,120
Oh.

2197
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:12,680
387.

2198
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:13,880
Oh.

2199
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:17,260
Brother, you're not making it.

2200
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:19,260
You have three...

2201
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:21,020
Less than three hours left.

2202
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:22,380
Oh man.

2203
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:24,240
Oh man.

2204
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:27,040
Okay, I...

2205
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,260
I was like, oh man.

2206
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:30,300
I'm sorry man.

2207
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,580
No, I know this guy.

2208
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:33,700
This guy is really good.

2209
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,400
Everyone is...

2210
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:40,820
Is dooming right now.

2211
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:41,820
I don't know.

2212
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,620
Unless he gets five wins in a...

2213
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:47,440
He needs five to six...

2214
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:48,720
Wins in a row.

2215
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:51,000
To get it.

2216
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:53,260
But he has to get six matches.

2217
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:55,380
And he has to get six wins in a row.

2218
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:57,580
The doom is real.

2219
01:58:57,740 --> 01:58:58,340
Yeah, it is.

2220
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:00,460
It is real.

2221
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:02,340
It is so real.

2222
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:05,200
Everybody went through what I had to go through.

2223
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:06,900
Oh man.

2224
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:08,000
It's so...

2225
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:08,920
Oh my god.

2226
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:10,140
I'm sorry buddy.

2227
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:11,680
I...

2228
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:16,500
I like to see where they're at.

2229
01:59:16,580 --> 01:59:18,340
In their stage of life.

2230
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:21,260
I like to see...

2231
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:23,520
I like to see where they're at.

2232
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:24,880
Like how...

2233
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:28,800
How close were you guys?

2234
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:35,000
Rank warning is a hard life.

2235
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,720
All five stages of grief.

2236
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:41,200
We don't look at our quick play.

2237
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,300
That was quick play by the way.

2238
01:59:42,380 --> 01:59:44,360
If you see defeat, defeat, defeat, defeat.

2239
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,320
That was quick play guys.

2240
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:47,240
That wasn't...

2241
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,600
That was not...

2242
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:51,720
Now this was my rank time.

2243
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:52,800
But it got okay.

2244
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:54,460
It got...

2245
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:56,080
This was the stage where I quit.

2246
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:57,580
It was okay.

2247
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:58,780
And then it got here.

2248
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:00,580
That was when I...

2249
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:02,200
This is when I admitted defeat.

2250
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:03,300
And then I was like...

2251
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:05,260
I still want to get back my points though.

2252
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:06,060
I...

2253
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,000
This is where I was like...

2254
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:11,560
It's over.

2255
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:13,460
It's over.

2256
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:16,480
Alright.

2257
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:17,520
Raccoon time.

2258
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:18,680
Alright.

2259
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:19,920
We'll play one game of raccoon.

2260
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:23,040
Unless we get a raccoon one trick.

2261
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:29,640
We'll do one game.

2262
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:30,720
I won my...

2263
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,920
I won my rank game guys.

2264
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:36,220
I also got like...

2265
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:38,780
RNG'd so hard.

2266
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,960
I got such a huge RNG advantage.

2267
02:00:41,540 --> 02:00:42,140
With my team.

2268
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,960
My team was actually...

2269
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:46,960
My team was actually...

2270
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:47,880
Stacked too.

2271
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,460
I had soju.

2272
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:54,760
I had soju.

2273
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:57,340
I need like...

2274
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:58,800
I need 30 more minutes.

2275
02:00:59,020 --> 02:00:59,820
And then it's over.

2276
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:01,300
And then I'm free.

2277
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:03,000
I'm free.

2278
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:04,340
I'm free.

2279
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:08,640
30 more minutes of this...

2280
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:13,620
Don't worry.

2281
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:16,900
30 more minutes and then I'll be gone.

2282
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:19,940
I'll be gone.

2283
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,060
I think a lot of people gave up too.

2284
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:26,540
That's why the matches are taking a long time.

2285
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:30,300
A lot of people just gave up.

2286
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:32,880
Just like me.

2287
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:38,620
Alright, are they...

2288
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:39,780
Oh, they're roleplayers.

2289
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:42,540
Oh no, people are killing.

2290
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:45,000
I only saw like 2 kills so I wasn't sure.

2291
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:47,840
Oh no, they're not roleplaying.

2292
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:51,060
Actual gameplay.

2293
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,740
Actual players, let's go.

2294
02:01:55,620 --> 02:01:56,560
I'm scared.

2295
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:00,700
There's so many people lurking.

2296
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:05,180
He literally just got a game.

2297
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:08,740
Okay.

2298
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:12,900
Are they roleplaying?

2299
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:15,660
Wait, let me in.

2300
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:17,540
Am I banished?

2301
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:18,800
No, wait.

2302
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:26,300
That is sad.

2303
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:27,720
That is so sad.

2304
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:30,360
If he didn't ult, I win that 1v1.

2305
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:35,560
If he didn't get the health pack and if he didn't ult, I actually win that 1v1.

2306
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:40,940
Non-roleplayers are not allowed in this building.

2307
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:43,440
I wanna roleplay, guys.

2308
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:44,860
I'm a roleplayer.

2309
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:46,240
No need to shield me.

2310
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:48,140
I'm here to roleplay.

2311
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:49,600
Yeah, that's right.

2312
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,700
Oh, what the fuck?

2313
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:54,360
Bad.

2314
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:57,580
Bad.

2315
02:02:58,140 --> 02:02:59,200
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

2316
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,140
Stupid.

2317
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,280
I'm so stupid.

2318
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:07,080
Okay, I need heals.

2319
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:08,780
Hello.

2320
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:12,420
Am I gonna get flamed if I play Raccoon?

2321
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:13,440
Let's find out.

2322
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:16,640
Let's find out.

2323
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:19,940
Alright, let's see.

2324
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:20,900
Who do I get?

2325
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:22,660
Will I get flamed?

2326
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:25,260
That's a very good question.

2327
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:28,180
I wanna play.

2328
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:28,720
Alright.

2329
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:33,480
Alright, here we go.

2330
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:37,600
Alright, I'll swap off and then...

2331
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:40,000
Oh, we don't even have like...

2332
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,160
How am I gonna...

2333
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,300
Where's my Punisher?

2334
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:47,080
I don't even have...

2335
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:48,820
Nobody actually plays Magic these days.

2336
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:49,380
It's fine.

2337
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:51,140
Magic is so bad anyway.

2338
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:54,880
Oh.

2339
02:03:55,620 --> 02:03:56,260
Oh.

2340
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:01,420
Alright.

2341
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:02,660
Hello, Groot.

2342
02:04:02,860 --> 02:04:03,660
I'm banning Adam.

2343
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:07,160
Alright.

2344
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:07,920
Loki?

2345
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:09,040
Not Adam?

2346
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:11,200
Let's have a three-way gamble.

2347
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:14,080
Let's have a three-way gamble.

2348
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:15,060
Who's gonna win?

2349
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:17,260
Who's gonna win?

2350
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:20,460
The 220% or the 60%?

2351
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:21,560
Let's go gambling!

2352
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:26,160
Yay!

2353
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:31,880
Oh.

2354
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:36,820
Wait.

2355
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:42,780
Bro.

2356
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:50,080
That guy actually took Raccoon.

2357
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:53,220
Wait, he doesn't... No, he didn't want me to play Raccoon!

2358
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:55,040
He actually took...

2359
02:04:55,040 --> 02:05:00,060
They took Raccoon because he wouldn't want me to play Raccoon!

2360
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:04,120
Guys.

2361
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:07,280
He didn't want me to do it.

2362
02:05:07,580 --> 02:05:09,260
That's amazing.

2363
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:10,700
Bro.

2364
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:13,060
He didn't want me to play.

2365
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:16,230
What am I supposed to do if I can't play Raccoon?

2366
02:05:16,230 --> 02:05:16,550
Dude.

2367
02:05:24,450 --> 02:05:25,330
Oh, wait.

2368
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:26,850
Oh, wait.

2369
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:28,130
No, he is a Rocket player.

2370
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:29,050
No, he is!

2371
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:32,190
He is a Rocket player!

2372
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:37,670
I don't want to DPS.

2373
02:05:37,930 --> 02:05:39,210
This life is too comfortable.

2374
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:41,450
I don't know.

2375
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:43,670
I don't know if he has...

2376
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:44,190
I don't know.

2377
02:05:44,450 --> 02:05:45,670
I don't know if he is.

2378
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:48,050
I'm not...

2379
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:49,210
Okay.

2380
02:05:50,190 --> 02:05:51,150
Oh, no.

2381
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:53,010
Man.

2382
02:05:53,470 --> 02:05:55,550
I just wanted to play Rocket.

2383
02:05:55,730 --> 02:05:57,950
If we lose the first point, I'm playing Rocket.

2384
02:05:58,650 --> 02:05:59,790
Because it's over anyway.

2385
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:04,930
It's over anyway.

2386
02:06:08,290 --> 02:06:09,950
You and me.

2387
02:06:10,910 --> 02:06:12,290
You and me.

2388
02:06:16,030 --> 02:06:17,270
You and me.

2389
02:06:17,470 --> 02:06:18,150
It's our life.

2390
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:22,590
You and me.

2391
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:25,490
It's just you and me.

2392
02:06:27,170 --> 02:06:28,430
I pulled him.

2393
02:06:28,650 --> 02:06:29,270
You're welcome.

2394
02:06:29,890 --> 02:06:31,570
It's just you and me.

2395
02:06:34,430 --> 02:06:36,310
I don't know how I got that pull.

2396
02:06:36,650 --> 02:06:37,790
But I'll take it.

2397
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:42,330
Yippee!

2398
02:06:43,330 --> 02:06:46,530
It's more fun when you don't take it seriously.

2399
02:06:47,070 --> 02:06:48,830
Just you and me.

2400
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:49,790
Boom.

2401
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:50,330
Get out.

2402
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:51,390
Don't touch him.

2403
02:06:54,450 --> 02:06:54,730
Okay.

2404
02:06:57,150 --> 02:06:58,010
Oh, wait.

2405
02:06:58,090 --> 02:06:59,490
She already got...

2406
02:06:59,490 --> 02:07:00,430
That's crazy.

2407
02:07:01,090 --> 02:07:03,010
That's crazy that she already...

2408
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:05,830
Ugh.

2409
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:07,230
Okay.

2410
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:08,030
You get out first.

2411
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:13,510
I don't care enough.

2412
02:07:22,610 --> 02:07:23,650
Damage booster!

2413
02:07:24,610 --> 02:07:24,970
See?

2414
02:07:25,110 --> 02:07:25,670
Look at that!

2415
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:27,410
Look at that!

2416
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:30,790
You caught her first.

2417
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:32,110
Fucking clutch.

2418
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:36,690
Look at that.

2419
02:07:36,690 --> 02:07:38,170
That was a beautiful wheel.

2420
02:07:40,730 --> 02:07:44,030
I want to play Rocket, please.

2421
02:07:44,450 --> 02:07:47,410
He doesn't want to try anymore.

2422
02:07:54,590 --> 02:07:57,650
He's just like, don't make me try.

2423
02:07:57,790 --> 02:07:59,050
It's end of season.

2424
02:07:59,630 --> 02:08:01,950
Don't make me try.

2425
02:08:05,510 --> 02:08:07,930
It's time to try, buddy.

2426
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:14,790
It's time to try, buddy.

2427
02:08:15,770 --> 02:08:16,630
You get...

2428
02:08:16,630 --> 02:08:18,370
This is your life now.

2429
02:08:19,070 --> 02:08:21,450
I wanted to play Rocket too!

2430
02:08:24,490 --> 02:08:26,470
He just threw me off.

2431
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:27,450
Bitch.

2432
02:08:28,730 --> 02:08:29,650
You're fine.

2433
02:08:29,790 --> 02:08:30,770
I'm saving my ult.

2434
02:08:30,770 --> 02:08:30,890
Bro...

2435
02:08:34,110 --> 02:08:38,070
Bro got a 3k and wants to play Raccoon.

2436
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:43,430
Oh, you guys can't see it because I have Raccoon.

2437
02:08:44,850 --> 02:08:45,450
Raccoon.

2438
02:08:46,670 --> 02:08:47,270
Blacklisted.

2439
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:55,700
I wanted...

2440
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:58,200
I wanted to play Raccoon.

2441
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:03,860
What do you mean?

2442
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:06,020
I fucking saved this bitch's life.

2443
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:07,160
She's not an actual bitch.

2444
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,240
I'm just...

2445
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:09,360
I'm sorry.

2446
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:13,300
Sorry, I got a little too intense there.

2447
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:17,500
The amount of times I've saved her life...

2448
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:19,060
With my right click.

2449
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:23,960
She's not an actual bitch, guys.

2450
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:25,880
Sorry.

2451
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:28,660
Most annoying voice ever, later, forever.

2452
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,380
Thanks for the hate view.

2453
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:32,180
I appreciate it.

2454
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:34,880
It gives me plus one on the category.

2455
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:40,300
Never apologize.

2456
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:46,160
First one if you're a hate viewer.

2457
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:58,930
I think if they start like...

2458
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:01,470
I live.

2459
02:10:09,810 --> 02:10:10,450
Okay.

2460
02:10:12,030 --> 02:10:16,510
Okay, I was not paying attention if they had a Wolverine.

2461
02:10:17,030 --> 02:10:18,890
I should have looked, guys.

2462
02:10:19,110 --> 02:10:20,210
That was my bad.

2463
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:21,370
I was actually fucking...

2464
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:22,830
I can't.

2465
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:26,210
I need to not fuck around.

2466
02:10:27,410 --> 02:10:28,050
Sorry.

2467
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:31,690
Okay, I got it.

2468
02:10:32,170 --> 02:10:33,010
Wait, they're one support.

2469
02:10:33,010 --> 02:10:36,350
Oh no, they have too many DPS for me to go rocket though.

2470
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:37,910
That sucks.

2471
02:10:38,110 --> 02:10:39,470
Because we need double defensive.

2472
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:41,170
Because of the amount of...

2473
02:10:41,170 --> 02:10:44,110
Because of the amount of fucking...

2474
02:10:44,110 --> 02:10:46,150
I fucked up his...

2475
02:10:46,150 --> 02:10:46,950
There we go.

2476
02:10:47,310 --> 02:10:47,530
What?

2477
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:47,950
Why?

2478
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:50,470
Okay.

2479
02:10:51,910 --> 02:10:52,850
Oh, it's for the...

2480
02:10:52,850 --> 02:10:54,690
Wait, but he didn't kill anybody.

2481
02:11:02,190 --> 02:11:02,710
Wait.

2482
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:05,170
Wait, guys.

2483
02:11:06,210 --> 02:11:07,210
We might...

2484
02:11:07,210 --> 02:11:09,890
We might be fucked here with this.

2485
02:11:10,030 --> 02:11:11,270
What is this?

2486
02:11:12,170 --> 02:11:14,150
This end of season shit is crazy.

2487
02:11:14,570 --> 02:11:15,450
Not gonna lie.

2488
02:11:18,890 --> 02:11:20,050
They don't have supports.

2489
02:11:20,250 --> 02:11:21,190
Wait, we can just kill them.

2490
02:11:21,190 --> 02:11:22,030
Wait, what?

2491
02:11:22,170 --> 02:11:22,830
We win?

2492
02:11:28,110 --> 02:11:30,170
We win the point?

2493
02:11:31,690 --> 02:11:32,730
That's crazy.

2494
02:11:32,950 --> 02:11:34,610
I was not paying attention.

2495
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:39,150
Yeah, I know.

2496
02:11:39,290 --> 02:11:40,390
What was that fight?

2497
02:11:40,850 --> 02:11:42,050
I was...

2498
02:11:42,870 --> 02:11:45,010
I was like, we win that?

2499
02:11:45,570 --> 02:11:46,250
Really?

2500
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:49,590
What the fuck is going on?

2501
02:11:51,190 --> 02:11:54,070
Oh my god.

2502
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:06,440
I can stay up here.

2503
02:12:06,980 --> 02:12:07,500
It's chill.

2504
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:16,940
I solo ulted for me.

2505
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:19,400
And me only.

2506
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:21,260
I literally...

2507
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:25,020
I was just like...

2508
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:26,380
Solo ulting myself.

2509
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:27,600
That's right.

2510
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:29,400
I get to live.

2511
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:31,880
Let's go.

2512
02:12:32,780 --> 02:12:34,840
Me, myself and I.

2513
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:36,180
Oh shit.

2514
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:40,260
I'm a team player.

2515
02:12:40,740 --> 02:12:42,460
Don't ever say I'm not against.

2516
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:48,240
I want my...

2517
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:49,940
I want my Luna to get her ult.

2518
02:12:50,730 --> 02:12:52,600
There you go.

2519
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,940
There you go, she'll live.

2520
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:58,980
I knew she'd live.

2521
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:03,200
I knew she'd live.

2522
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:09,620
What is this game?

2523
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:18,040
I'm a hero.

2524
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:21,600
We just need more damage.

2525
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:22,500
No gap.

2526
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:24,060
Wait, I went two in a row?

2527
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:25,020
Get over here.

2528
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:26,340
Let's go.

2529
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:27,660
Guys, this is eternity.

2530
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:30,800
This is eternity.

2531
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:33,400
Holy fuck.

2532
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:35,380
Look at...

2533
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:37,680
At your teeth.

2534
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:38,500
Bro.

2535
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:41,460
This is actually...

2536
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:43,180
Wow.

2537
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:45,780
I love...

2538
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:48,500
I love rank.

2539
02:13:50,180 --> 02:13:51,020
I love rank.

2540
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:52,720
See, you just gotta give up.

2541
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:53,740
Like me.

2542
02:13:57,100 --> 02:13:59,880
You just gotta give up.

2543
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:01,540
Just like what I do.

2544
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:03,220
I'm gonna use the bathroom, guys.

2545
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:06,920
And then the winds come rolling in.

2546
02:15:19,230 --> 02:15:19,810
Back.

2547
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:20,810
I'm back, guys.

2548
02:15:21,330 --> 02:15:23,650
I have 15 more minutes.

2549
02:15:23,650 --> 02:15:23,950
Okay.

2550
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:27,930
15 more minutes.

2551
02:15:28,730 --> 02:15:30,690
I mean, I'm already up one.

2552
02:15:30,890 --> 02:15:31,770
Let's just...

2553
02:15:32,430 --> 02:15:33,670
I'm literally up two.

2554
02:15:34,030 --> 02:15:36,270
So if we lose this one, I'm up one game.

2555
02:15:36,570 --> 02:15:37,770
So that's good enough.

2556
02:15:42,590 --> 02:15:43,870
It starts.

2557
02:15:44,930 --> 02:15:46,570
If I play...

2558
02:15:46,570 --> 02:15:49,390
I mean, technically, I don't...

2559
02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:51,050
I'm the drunk one here.

2560
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:52,530
But yet, somehow...

2561
02:15:53,010 --> 02:15:57,470
The Doom Queers are more of an ELO terrorist than I am.

2562
02:15:57,610 --> 02:15:59,570
That's actually crazy.

2563
02:16:00,070 --> 02:16:00,490
The...

2564
02:16:02,410 --> 02:16:05,550
The sober people are...

2565
02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:06,530
Are...

2566
02:16:07,570 --> 02:16:10,610
Are doing worse than what I do.

2567
02:16:11,010 --> 02:16:11,810
In rank.

2568
02:16:13,970 --> 02:16:15,670
That's insane.

2569
02:16:17,530 --> 02:16:18,490
Like...

2570
02:16:19,410 --> 02:16:20,470
It's so...

2571
02:16:20,470 --> 02:16:20,530
It's so weird.

2572
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:25,130
You don't know.

2573
02:16:25,230 --> 02:16:25,830
That's true.

2574
02:16:26,010 --> 02:16:27,830
I don't know if they're sober or not.

2575
02:16:28,030 --> 02:16:29,010
They could just be...

2576
02:16:29,010 --> 02:16:30,010
They could be like me.

2577
02:16:31,770 --> 02:16:32,990
Just drunk queuing.

2578
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:34,730
But like, I don't know.

2579
02:16:34,890 --> 02:16:38,870
It feels like a lot of people are trying to see if they can get top 500 in the last three hours.

2580
02:16:39,110 --> 02:16:40,230
So like, who knows?

2581
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:43,190
The desperation.

2582
02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:44,110
Yeah.

2583
02:16:44,530 --> 02:16:49,350
Drunk queue over...

2584
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:52,970
It's not good.

2585
02:16:53,070 --> 02:16:54,430
Yeah, 100%.

2586
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:57,530
Do I play what?

2587
02:16:57,650 --> 02:16:58,970
Let's just end it on a quick play.

2588
02:16:59,090 --> 02:17:00,870
I'll play Raccoon and quick play.

2589
02:17:01,530 --> 02:17:04,570
I don't think life is gonna give me Raccoon.

2590
02:17:06,910 --> 02:17:08,110
What's it at anyway?

2591
02:17:08,490 --> 02:17:09,530
How many games have I played?

2592
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:11,290
Oh, come on.

2593
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:16,350
Alright.

2594
02:17:18,910 --> 02:17:20,210
How much do I have to win?

2595
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:22,290
I need to win 10 games in a row.

2596
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:23,690
So yeah.

2597
02:17:23,810 --> 02:17:24,790
That ain't happening.

2598
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:26,310
Look at that.

2599
02:17:26,410 --> 02:17:27,230
Let's go.

2600
02:17:29,630 --> 02:17:31,630
I need to win 10 games in a row, guys.

2601
02:17:32,030 --> 02:17:32,450
That's...

2602
02:17:33,530 --> 02:17:34,650
That's not easy.

2603
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:39,550
That's why I'm here.

2604
02:17:40,630 --> 02:17:43,830
Matthews, thank you for gifting a tier 1 sub to SnowGold and Kirby.

2605
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:44,270
Thank you.

2606
02:17:44,490 --> 02:17:44,870
Thank you.

2607
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:47,870
Thank you for the reset for 11 months.

2608
02:17:47,990 --> 02:17:48,650
Thank you.

2609
02:17:49,610 --> 02:17:50,890
Alright, here I go.

2610
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:53,250
Yeah, 10 games in a row.

2611
02:17:55,490 --> 02:17:58,570
Less than 3 hours is the reset for me.

2612
02:17:58,870 --> 02:17:59,070
Alright.

2613
02:17:59,650 --> 02:18:02,370
From what I know, I'm practicing for Season 2.

2614
02:18:03,870 --> 02:18:04,750
Hello, that's me.

2615
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:06,990
It's Raccoon time.

2616
02:18:07,890 --> 02:18:10,370
There's so many people know me in quick play.

2617
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:11,510
That's crazy.

2618
02:18:12,470 --> 02:18:13,510
Hello, everybody.

2619
02:18:16,870 --> 02:18:18,990
Oh, I learned this tech from my friend.

2620
02:18:20,670 --> 02:18:23,110
Like, you climb this and then you can do that.

2621
02:18:23,190 --> 02:18:24,670
You climb this and press shift.

2622
02:18:24,830 --> 02:18:30,470
I don't know if this is an actual tech, but you can basically zoom up really fast against the wall by that.

2623
02:18:31,490 --> 02:18:31,910
And then...

2624
02:18:31,910 --> 02:18:32,150
Woo!

2625
02:18:33,930 --> 02:18:35,070
The super dash.

2626
02:18:36,090 --> 02:18:38,250
Season 2 is gonna be...

2627
02:18:38,250 --> 02:18:40,430
Season 2 is Raccoon meta.

2628
02:18:41,110 --> 02:18:42,550
He has his new ult.

2629
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:46,330
His new ult is like insane.

2630
02:18:46,770 --> 02:18:48,190
Well, like, there's so many...

2631
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:56,950
The thing is, there's a lot of really, really fucking terrible Raccoon players who one-trick Raccoon and don't know how to do like, Raccoon movement and shit.

2632
02:18:57,250 --> 02:18:59,570
Like, all they do is just like...

2633
02:18:59,570 --> 02:19:00,270
They just do this.

2634
02:19:04,470 --> 02:19:05,510
That's literally...

2635
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:07,190
That's literally all they do.

2636
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:11,650
Like, they don't move around.

2637
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:13,550
They just, like...

2638
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:16,410
They just, like, sit there.

2639
02:19:17,270 --> 02:19:23,790
And I'm trying to, like, know, like, how to do proper proper, like, movement around and stuff.

2640
02:19:24,690 --> 02:19:30,930
Because you're supposed to, like, to properly play Raccoon at a higher ELO is to just frequently move around.

2641
02:19:32,170 --> 02:19:36,110
So most... Yeah, like, literally a lot of one-tricks actually just do this.

2642
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:37,350
They literally just do that.

2643
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:44,210
But you're supposed to, like, move around and, like, so people don't know exactly where you are and stuff.

2644
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:48,090
And, like, so you don't get, like, easily dived and everything.

2645
02:19:48,770 --> 02:19:50,590
You're supposed to be, like, frequently...

2646
02:19:50,590 --> 02:19:50,790
Yeah.

2647
02:19:51,510 --> 02:19:53,570
And they have, like, lineups and stuff, too.

2648
02:19:54,330 --> 02:19:58,090
So, like, people don't know exactly where you are since you're so fucking tiny and annoying.

2649
02:19:58,710 --> 02:20:00,930
And those are, like, the good Raccoon players.

2650
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:04,950
But, like, the good Raccoon players are usually just people who...

2651
02:20:04,950 --> 02:20:05,610
Oh my god, sorry.

2652
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:06,510
I was fucking around there.

2653
02:20:10,570 --> 02:20:12,670
Sorry, I was, like, actually fucking around.

2654
02:20:12,790 --> 02:20:14,590
I wasn't trying to do anything.

2655
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:18,790
There you go.

2656
02:20:21,510 --> 02:20:22,730
Alright, let's push up.

2657
02:20:25,350 --> 02:20:25,930
There we go.

2658
02:20:28,270 --> 02:20:28,890
Okay.

2659
02:20:32,970 --> 02:20:34,130
I leave now.

2660
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:35,270
I leave.

2661
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:37,250
I leave now.

2662
02:20:37,250 --> 02:20:38,170
I leave.

2663
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:40,510
Let's go!

2664
02:20:40,990 --> 02:20:41,870
Goodbye.

2665
02:20:42,610 --> 02:20:45,210
Goodbye, I'm sorry.

2666
02:20:48,010 --> 02:20:51,130
You have to be, like, everywhere.

2667
02:20:56,790 --> 02:20:58,170
Wait, I know you're one.

2668
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:03,350
There you go.

2669
02:21:05,050 --> 02:21:06,090
The snake.

2670
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:08,530
Yeah, see?

2671
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:14,650
This is how, like, actual... Why can't, like, my one-trick Raccoon players do that, though?

2672
02:21:14,910 --> 02:21:16,230
Like, I don't understand.

2673
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:18,870
It's so easy to not be a bot.

2674
02:21:21,750 --> 02:21:26,050
It's actually so easy to not be a fucking bot at this game.

2675
02:21:29,570 --> 02:21:29,950
Hello.

2676
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:34,610
I'm gonna hide up here for a little bit because they don't know I'm here.

2677
02:21:35,610 --> 02:21:36,530
They actually don't know.

2678
02:21:38,210 --> 02:21:38,470
Oh.

2679
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:41,190
They're all still here.

2680
02:21:42,010 --> 02:21:42,550
It's fine.

2681
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:47,610
It's fine, I'm gonna save you!

2682
02:21:47,770 --> 02:21:48,670
Take the orb!

2683
02:21:51,690 --> 02:21:52,710
Oh, he got healed.

2684
02:21:52,850 --> 02:21:54,330
Don't worry, sir, I got you.

2685
02:21:55,430 --> 02:21:56,490
Don't worry, sir.

2686
02:21:56,590 --> 02:21:57,770
Oh, he saw it, he saw it.

2687
02:21:57,790 --> 02:21:59,590
Guys, guys, protect it, protect it!

2688
02:21:59,590 --> 02:22:00,330
No!

2689
02:22:04,890 --> 02:22:05,770
My rez!

2690
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:07,170
Okay, push up, guys.

2691
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:08,630
Oh, that's sad.

2692
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:09,550
I wasn't paying...

2693
02:22:09,550 --> 02:22:10,750
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

2694
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:12,490
Alright, here we go.

2695
02:22:14,130 --> 02:22:15,050
No, I'm defensive.

2696
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:15,710
Oh, good luck.

2697
02:22:16,990 --> 02:22:17,930
Good luck, guys.

2698
02:22:19,170 --> 02:22:20,750
No, no, no!

2699
02:22:22,090 --> 02:22:25,710
Oh, we see more... I don't know.

2700
02:22:26,150 --> 02:22:27,370
Rocket is such an easy hero.

2701
02:22:27,550 --> 02:22:29,590
I feel like everybody's gonna fight to play him.

2702
02:22:31,190 --> 02:22:32,250
I feel like.

2703
02:22:35,110 --> 02:22:37,310
I tried to... I didn't want him to hit us.

2704
02:22:38,050 --> 02:22:39,890
Like, I mean, I didn't...

2705
02:22:39,890 --> 02:22:43,550
The reason why I didn't despawn is that he spends so much time trying to kill it.

2706
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:45,310
He's not... Oh, shit.

2707
02:22:45,530 --> 02:22:47,150
He's not, like, shooting us.

2708
02:22:47,230 --> 02:22:48,250
That's why I didn't do anything.

2709
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:50,650
That's why I was like, get him!

2710
02:22:51,430 --> 02:22:51,870
Please!

2711
02:22:53,950 --> 02:22:54,390
Please!

2712
02:22:54,930 --> 02:22:55,710
Get him!

2713
02:22:55,710 --> 02:22:57,450
Wow, I'm so annoying!

2714
02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:04,410
Why can't my Raccoon one-tricks do that?

2715
02:23:07,150 --> 02:23:10,290
Why can't my Raccoon one-tricks do that?

2716
02:23:10,310 --> 02:23:11,530
I'm so sad.

2717
02:23:13,870 --> 02:23:14,550
Oh,

2718
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:20,530
I think this team fell apart.

2719
02:23:21,430 --> 02:23:23,690
My team has already fallen apart.

2720
02:23:24,390 --> 02:23:25,250
That's crazy.

2721
02:23:28,090 --> 02:23:28,770
Come on, shoot it.

2722
02:23:29,050 --> 02:23:30,070
I know y'all want to.

2723
02:23:30,190 --> 02:23:30,970
Shoot my thing.

2724
02:23:31,950 --> 02:23:32,690
Shoot it.

2725
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:36,770
Oh, that was so good from him.

2726
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:39,850
Why did you run away from my heals?

2727
02:23:40,110 --> 02:23:40,730
Are you stupid?

2728
02:23:44,670 --> 02:23:46,030
Are you stupid?

2729
02:23:47,330 --> 02:23:48,810
Oh, shit, no, I'm stupid.

2730
02:23:48,930 --> 02:23:50,230
Wait, where did he come from?

2731
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:58,430
Oh, he comboed my fucking ass.

2732
02:23:58,530 --> 02:23:58,990
It's okay.

2733
02:23:59,190 --> 02:24:00,470
My team's got this.

2734
02:24:03,730 --> 02:24:05,010
Don't worry, guys.

2735
02:24:05,150 --> 02:24:06,610
You can win this fight.

2736
02:24:06,850 --> 02:24:10,510
With the power of teamwork and all that shit, I don't know.

2737
02:24:12,570 --> 02:24:13,750
Don't worry, guys.

2738
02:24:14,350 --> 02:24:16,570
He's gonna get the...

2739
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:18,510
Don't worry.

2740
02:24:19,090 --> 02:24:21,070
He's gonna get my damage boost.

2741
02:24:21,230 --> 02:24:22,430
For that one guy.

2742
02:24:23,230 --> 02:24:24,170
He's gonna get it.

2743
02:24:24,290 --> 02:24:25,310
Come on, damage boost.

2744
02:24:25,450 --> 02:24:27,210
You have damage boost.

2745
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:30,070
Oh my god, he had damage boost.

2746
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:32,270
He had damage boost and he ran away.

2747
02:24:32,670 --> 02:24:35,310
Strange, you had damage boost.

2748
02:24:35,470 --> 02:24:36,810
Why are you scared?

2749
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:43,410
Rocket nurse?

2750
02:24:43,670 --> 02:24:45,410
More like rocket buffs.

2751
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:48,350
Sorry, my amplifier still doesn't have the fucking...

2752
02:24:48,350 --> 02:24:48,810
What was it?

2753
02:24:48,870 --> 02:24:50,430
20% plus more shield?

2754
02:24:50,430 --> 02:24:52,270
That shit's fucking crazy.

2755
02:24:54,210 --> 02:24:56,570
Why was he so scared?

2756
02:24:57,070 --> 02:25:00,050
He was running away from one guy.

2757
02:25:01,850 --> 02:25:03,110
That's crazy.

2758
02:25:03,290 --> 02:25:06,030
I can't believe he was running away from one guy.

2759
02:25:07,430 --> 02:25:10,070
I was literally right clicking to heal him.

2760
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:11,590
And he was still running away.

2761
02:25:13,930 --> 02:25:14,510
Yeah.

2762
02:25:15,130 --> 02:25:15,810
Yeah.

2763
02:25:16,090 --> 02:25:18,850
He ran away.

2764
02:25:18,850 --> 02:25:21,210
With an amplifier.

2765
02:25:21,710 --> 02:25:23,150
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2766
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:25,630
Oh yeah, you always want to see a cool key.

2767
02:25:28,170 --> 02:25:32,050
If you go Punisher and go up to this window, you can see the people.

2768
02:25:32,490 --> 02:25:33,270
Who's in it.

2769
02:25:36,810 --> 02:25:38,110
I can't do it in time.

2770
02:25:40,910 --> 02:25:41,810
I couldn't do it.

2771
02:25:42,230 --> 02:25:44,830
It's only Punisher and you just go against the wall.

2772
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:46,770
And you can see what characters are playing.

2773
02:25:50,250 --> 02:25:51,890
Are you good enough for this?

2774
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:56,460
Are you?

2775
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:58,020
I don't know.

2776
02:25:58,700 --> 02:25:59,720
Are you though?

2777
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:01,280
What if I just put it right there?

2778
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:05,480
I just put the...

2779
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:08,520
I literally just put the...

2780
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:10,640
There's no way he sees it, right?

2781
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,480
Bro, they didn't see it.

2782
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:16,220
I told you.

2783
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:17,960
I told you.

2784
02:26:21,140 --> 02:26:22,520
He doesn't need this.

2785
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:28,340
He doesn't need this.

2786
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:31,140
He has a free reset too.

2787
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:34,940
I wish people would break this more often.

2788
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:36,140
Oh my god, wait.

2789
02:26:36,460 --> 02:26:39,080
Why do my raccoons not break these?

2790
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:40,660
This damage is so...

2791
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:41,780
Oh wait, I should...

2792
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:42,020
Hello.

2793
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:45,360
Oh sorry, it's too far.

2794
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:49,820
I threw the wrong area.

2795
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:51,160
Sorry, buddy.

2796
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:54,220
I was not paying attention.

2797
02:26:54,980 --> 02:26:55,260
Whoops.

2798
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:57,200
That's fine.

2799
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:01,420
It'll be fine now.

2800
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:03,820
Now you guys can kill them all.

2801
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:07,420
Come on, kill them all.

2802
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:10,440
Give me this point.

2803
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:13,040
It's just that easy.

2804
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:15,080
Are you still alive?

2805
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:18,160
Jesus Christ.

2806
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:20,060
This damage is crazy actually.

2807
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:20,820
Whoops.

2808
02:27:21,780 --> 02:27:23,020
Does he respawn?

2809
02:27:23,180 --> 02:27:23,780
Yeah, he does.

2810
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:24,240
Okay.

2811
02:27:25,380 --> 02:27:26,700
He has to run all the way back though.

2812
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:29,900
Because I literally put that in our spawn.

2813
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:35,020
Don't worry, Bucky!

2814
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:36,920
Whoops.

2815
02:27:39,980 --> 02:27:41,940
Bucky, where are you going?

2816
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:44,160
Like...

2817
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:47,380
No!

2818
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:49,380
Wait, I can fly.

2819
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:53,040
I am a hero.

2820
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:04,860
I am a hero.

2821
02:28:10,660 --> 02:28:14,110
What the fuck is wrong with all of you?

2822
02:28:14,370 --> 02:28:15,790
What the fuck?

2823
02:28:15,790 --> 02:28:17,490
I'm just a record!

2824
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:22,770
I don't live.

2825
02:28:22,830 --> 02:28:23,190
I don't live.

2826
02:28:23,230 --> 02:28:23,650
I don't live.

2827
02:28:26,710 --> 02:28:28,570
My team died.

2828
02:28:29,070 --> 02:28:31,370
Out of everybody, my team dies.

2829
02:28:31,670 --> 02:28:32,410
That's crazy.

2830
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:35,070
That's crazy.

2831
02:28:35,590 --> 02:28:36,230
I lived.

2832
02:28:40,130 --> 02:28:45,450
Out of everybody, I'm the one that lives.

2833
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:47,070
That's actually crazy.

2834
02:28:47,530 --> 02:28:49,410
See, I don't understand!

2835
02:28:49,870 --> 02:28:51,830
If you one-trick this character...

2836
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:53,690
Why can't you do that?

2837
02:28:56,510 --> 02:28:59,150
I don't understand.

2838
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:03,110
Shoot your gun.

2839
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:05,050
Do your little thing.

2840
02:29:05,490 --> 02:29:07,110
Shoot your gun.

2841
02:29:07,650 --> 02:29:09,530
You get extra damage.

2842
02:29:09,690 --> 02:29:10,710
Just kill this guy.

2843
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:11,530
I don't care.

2844
02:29:11,770 --> 02:29:13,410
I just want you to kill him.

2845
02:29:17,310 --> 02:29:18,710
Just kill him.

2846
02:29:18,910 --> 02:29:20,010
With my extra damage.

2847
02:29:22,550 --> 02:29:23,550
Wait, that guy is one.

2848
02:29:24,330 --> 02:29:25,290
Luna is one, actually.

2849
02:29:27,550 --> 02:29:28,410
Where is she?

2850
02:29:30,470 --> 02:29:31,430
There we go.

2851
02:29:37,530 --> 02:29:39,090
Does he hit anybody?

2852
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:39,790
Oh shit!

2853
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:41,430
Whoa!

2854
02:29:43,410 --> 02:29:45,630
Where is my...

2855
02:29:45,630 --> 02:29:48,690
Oh, she's over there.

2856
02:29:48,790 --> 02:29:49,250
Don't worry.

2857
02:29:49,290 --> 02:29:49,490
Don't worry.

2858
02:29:49,530 --> 02:29:49,790
I got you.

2859
02:29:49,830 --> 02:29:50,250
I got you.

2860
02:29:50,290 --> 02:29:50,770
Don't worry.

2861
02:29:50,850 --> 02:29:51,230
I got you.

2862
02:29:51,250 --> 02:29:51,730
I got you.

2863
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:53,570
Use it for this.

2864
02:29:54,890 --> 02:29:55,370
That's right.

2865
02:29:55,450 --> 02:29:55,910
Here we go.

2866
02:30:00,090 --> 02:30:00,810
I could...

2867
02:30:00,810 --> 02:30:01,630
Oh, I should heal.

2868
02:30:01,850 --> 02:30:02,410
I should heal.

2869
02:30:02,570 --> 02:30:03,130
I should heal.

2870
02:30:03,370 --> 02:30:04,110
I could heal.

2871
02:30:04,270 --> 02:30:05,330
But I could also do that.

2872
02:30:11,190 --> 02:30:11,550
Yippee!

2873
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:16,390
I expert rodent movement.

2874
02:30:21,650 --> 02:30:24,070
That's how you play an actual raccoon.

2875
02:30:24,470 --> 02:30:26,970
And then I spectated that one fucker.

2876
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:28,070
That one trickster.

2877
02:30:28,490 --> 02:30:30,250
And I see her do this.

2878
02:30:36,540 --> 02:30:38,760
80 miles away from the team.

2879
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:40,840
No, sorry.

2880
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:41,740
The team would be...

2881
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:42,740
Okay, Penny is the team.

2882
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:45,340
This is Eternity Lobby.

2883
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:47,800
And the people that one trick rocket.

2884
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,020
No, I'd be far away.

2885
02:30:51,180 --> 02:30:52,900
I'd be all the way in that city.

2886
02:30:53,340 --> 02:30:54,660
I'll be in that city.

2887
02:30:55,020 --> 02:30:56,360
And I'll be doing this.

2888
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:01,700
No, you don't understand.

2889
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:04,420
That shit tilted me so much.

2890
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:06,120
That actually...

2891
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:11,200
You guys saw what I have to do as Luna and Invis during those two games.

2892
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:12,880
Even when like not sober.

2893
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:15,020
Even when I was not sober.

2894
02:31:15,460 --> 02:31:17,880
And that's the amount of shit I had to do.

2895
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:20,080
And then I see...

2896
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:21,920
And then I see that.

2897
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:24,180
It actually like...

2898
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:25,180
Oh my god.

2899
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:27,140
It actually killed me.

2900
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:28,840
I'm... what?

2901
02:31:32,260 --> 02:31:33,440
What happened?

2902
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:37,500
Where's my...

2903
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:38,960
Where did my Bucky go?

2904
02:31:41,660 --> 02:31:43,780
Guys, I have one hour to win 10 games.

2905
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:45,260
Do you think I can do it?

2906
02:31:48,100 --> 02:31:52,260
I just have one hour to win.

2907
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:53,320
To win.

2908
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:55,540
To win 10 games.

2909
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:57,460
Guys, do you think it's possible?

2910
02:31:57,740 --> 02:31:59,440
I don't think we're winning this one.

2911
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:02,300
I mean, I could go like a real character.

2912
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,480
But that's not fun.

2913
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:07,280
I don't think it's saveable.

2914
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:10,340
I don't think so.

2915
02:32:10,340 --> 02:32:12,880
Okay, this is what I saw.

2916
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:17,700
Like, why would...

2917
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:25,220
It's like the idea that the thing will eventually...

2918
02:32:27,560 --> 02:32:28,720
Oh, we're fucking dead.

2919
02:32:28,780 --> 02:32:30,140
I have no defense up yet.

2920
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:33,360
This is like the only way to kill me.

2921
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:34,700
Like an actual aimbot.

2922
02:32:40,820 --> 02:32:43,440
They need like an aimbot to kill me.

2923
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:55,520
Turkey please, it hurts so much.

2924
02:32:56,340 --> 02:33:03,580
Guys, I don't think if I play an actual support or a DPS for this team that anything would change, guys.

2925
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:07,200
I legitimately don't do nothing that I...

2926
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:08,780
This team...

2927
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:14,880
This team is might be a little special.

2928
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:18,840
Okay, it's fine.

2929
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:20,880
Maybe if I had another defensive ult.

2930
02:33:21,020 --> 02:33:21,360
Maybe?

2931
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:24,520
Hello, I shall be here now.

2932
02:33:26,780 --> 02:33:28,080
You're so dumb.

2933
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:34,740
You're so dumb, Max.

2934
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:36,440
Alright.

2935
02:33:39,220 --> 02:33:42,240
Yeah, this team I don't know if it's salvageable, guys.

2936
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:45,260
I don't know, guys.

2937
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:51,220
Who is he gonna eat?

2938
02:33:51,320 --> 02:33:52,360
We're all split up.

2939
02:33:53,660 --> 02:33:54,860
Who did he eat?

2940
02:33:56,600 --> 02:33:57,080
Nobody?

2941
02:33:57,080 --> 02:33:57,580
Nobody?

2942
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:06,980
Oh shit, oh shit.

2943
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:08,980
Oh shit, no!

2944
02:34:09,100 --> 02:34:09,980
The only way to kill me!

2945
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:15,960
I didn't know where he was.

2946
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:17,840
Oh my god.

2947
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:18,820
We were all there.

2948
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:20,280
I was so confused.

2949
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:21,540
I was like, where is everybody?

2950
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:23,140
Alright.

2951
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:24,880
It was just quick play, guys.

2952
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:27,120
This is not an actual ranked match, by the way.

2953
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:31,480
For those who are like For those who are like, oh man.

2954
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:33,700
It's okay, it was quick play.

2955
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:39,560
I'm fine with that.

2956
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:42,200
I'm glad I did rodent.

2957
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:44,680
I did fucking rodent in quick play.

2958
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:50,160
We can tell it was- Yeah, don't worry!

2959
02:34:50,460 --> 02:34:52,900
We can tell it was quick play.

2960
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:55,280
Yeah, congrats!

2961
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:56,560
I made it!

2962
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:58,340
I did it, everybody!

2963
02:34:58,620 --> 02:34:59,640
I made it!

2964
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:01,060
Yippee!

2965
02:35:03,300 --> 02:35:05,340
I fucking did it!

2966
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:09,940
Guys, I actually did like quadruple the fucking damage of a regular rocket player.

2967
02:35:13,580 --> 02:35:14,680
See, it was quick play.

2968
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:17,100
See, you can see the quick play.

2969
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:21,080
Alright, guys.

2970
02:35:21,940 --> 02:35:24,560
I hope you guys have fun watching.

2971
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:27,520
Good luck to all the remaining DoomQers.

2972
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:34,940
Good luck to the remaining DoomQers that are still trying after an hour left.

2973
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:36,280
Wait, actually...

2974
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:37,860
What's the leaderboard right now?

2975
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:39,820
Oh my god.

2976
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:41,720
Yeah, good luck to everybody there.

2977
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:50,120
Good luck to the remaining Doomers out there with an hour left.

2978
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:53,280
Godspeed to you.

2979
02:35:53,560 --> 02:35:57,000
No, it's an hour left.

2980
02:35:57,100 --> 02:35:58,200
There's one hour.

2981
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:00,480
Yeah, that's why it's crazy.

2982
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:01,980
It's actually crazy.

2983
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:07,540
How many...

2984
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:09,620
A lot of people couldn't make it.

2985
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:11,560
A lot of pro players couldn't even get in.

2986
02:36:11,700 --> 02:36:22,260
I know so many pros that actually couldn't even get in because it was just too doomed.

2987
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:28,280
DoomQ was just too doomed.

2988
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:33,500
But it's okay.

2989
02:36:33,820 --> 02:36:36,460
I think this changes for next season.

2990
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:38,340
Is the game harder now?

2991
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:40,060
No, it's because they didn't rank reset.

2992
02:36:40,380 --> 02:37:01,740
They didn't rank reset and because they didn't rank reset there's a lot of players that are super inflated because all they do is play the game every day and if you play the game every day you can hit a lucky streak.

2993
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:07,940
This season was the first time I was like, who are these people?

2994
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:24,020
I've never had a season like the last previous seasons I was like oh I recognize these players but like this season was the first time when I was queuing rank the last three days where every game was a person I've never seen before.

2995
02:37:24,420 --> 02:37:24,900
Like ever.

2996
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:41,920
Like it was like the first time I've ever seen these people in my lobbies and it's like almost every game there's like three people I've never seen before and it's like it's very interesting.

2997
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:51,760
Yeah so like it's because like there's no rank reset so like there's so many inflated players in like the higher elo that like it's like basically a gamble.

2998
02:37:52,600 --> 02:38:00,220
Cause like the first season, season one was more fun than season 1.5 season 1.5 was a fucking chore.

2999
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:03,820
Like it felt like a chore when I was grinding rank.

3000
02:38:04,060 --> 02:38:14,420
When I was trying to like actively trying to climb but like when I was just playing for fun obviously when I'm playing for fun on stream, it's just me messing around so it didn't feel like a chore.

3001
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:21,560
But when I had a purpose to try to end top 500 this season it actually felt like a chore, like a job

3002
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:30,060
So like I hope that yeah there's like people, look at how many games these people have played.

3003
02:38:30,360 --> 02:38:32,640
I have 300 games played.

3004
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:39,900
These are like 499 so like 494 matches and everything.

3005
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:47,800
So cause that's includes, that's just um include, yeah that's right a lot.

3006
02:38:48,780 --> 02:38:50,780
Competitive 462 matches played.

3007
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:52,820
Oh my god this guy's win rate is insane right?

3008
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:54,580
No actually no it's 50-50.

3009
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:58,420
And then you can get 50-50% so like look.

3010
02:38:58,940 --> 02:39:36,890
Oh wait no this guy, actually no this guy, oh my god this guy this guy has a 50, oh wait 50% win rate on Luna but uh wait no yeah you can actually get like a 50% win rate on your heroes and still be top 500 that's the thing with uh that's the thing with this season it's just so fucking inflated like there's so many that's like uh let's see like you see a lot of people with like so many wins but those are wins uh yeah 50-50 on your You're on your main character and still... yeah,

3011
02:39:36,990 --> 02:39:38,170
that's like... it's weird.

3012
02:39:38,390 --> 02:39:40,170
I told you, this season is weird.

3013
02:39:40,730 --> 02:39:41,750
It's so weird.

3014
02:39:42,590 --> 02:39:43,650
Um, so like...

3015
02:39:44,170 --> 02:39:45,790
It's very luck dependent on who you get.

3016
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:50,850
You might get teammates that you actually recognize in the rank ladder or you get people who like you've never seen before.

3017
02:39:51,090 --> 02:39:53,610
Like I've had so many... I was like, who are these people?

3018
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:54,510
I've never...

3019
02:39:54,510 --> 02:39:55,990
I've never seen them.

3020
02:39:59,490 --> 02:40:06,610
But the new changes for next season seem... I like the new changes for next season because it's solo duos.

3021
02:40:06,750 --> 02:40:12,090
So you can't stack anymore because in the higher elo it is very frustrating because everybody stacks.

3022
02:40:12,590 --> 02:40:21,010
Now everybody stacks because it's the only way to like make it so like the odds were in your favor.

3023
02:40:21,610 --> 02:40:29,430
So like you can't do more than duos anymore in Eternity+, which is really nice because like I hated that.

3024
02:40:29,530 --> 02:40:41,530
I hated that because it forces people to just um, it just forces people to like adjust like, you know, make sure luck was like make sure you it's not as luck reliant as possible.

3025
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:48,550
Yeah, so I'm looking forward to that, but I'm also like not gonna try for top 500 next season.

3026
02:40:48,650 --> 02:40:50,830
I'm gonna play for fun because I definitely had a lot more fun.

3027
02:40:53,770 --> 02:40:54,210
I...

3028
02:40:54,210 --> 02:40:55,550
I had a lot of fun.
