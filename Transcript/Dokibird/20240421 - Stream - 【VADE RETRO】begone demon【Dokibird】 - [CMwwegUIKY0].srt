1
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,480
You're so big!

2
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:52,960
Hello!

3
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,240
Welcome!

4
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,420
Hello!

5
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,380
Welcome to Vade Retro!

6
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,560
Welcome to Vade Retro!

7
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:01,700
Yay!

8
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,600
Why don't we have some new friends here?

9
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,980
Why don't we have some new friends here?

10
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,360
Why don't you guys introduce yourselves?

11
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,180
Okay, not it.

12
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,160
Not me.

13
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,320
I'll go first.

14
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,520
Fuck you, I'll go first.

15
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,580
Pushes everybody out of the way.

16
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:14,860
Hi!

17
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,220
I'm KaiSekota from Idle.

18
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,960
Gen 2.

19
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm a dragon.

20
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,060
It's pretty cool.

21
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,620
Hi!

22
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Alright, cool.

23
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,460
That's it.

24
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:23,900
That's all I got.

25
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,380
Wow.

26
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,280
Thank you, blushes.

27
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,560
Hello!

28
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,260
My name is Bree!

29
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,400
I'm not from Idle.

30
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,080
I'm just me.

31
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,820
I'm a bunny.

32
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,620
I like Elden Ring.

33
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,020
I play a lot of that game.

34
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,440
That's it.

35
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,980
That's my entire personality.

36
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,540
We got a fucking name in the house!

37
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,920
Thank you for clarifying that you were not from Idle.

38
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,340
I was actually really confused.

39
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,540
I was like, I can't believe you're from my company.

40
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,080
Oh my god.

41
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,580
That's crazy.

42
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,480
Well, okay.

43
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,340
In my defense, in my head, you were gonna go, like, Yuna was gonna go after Kai, and then I was gonna be like, oh my god, I'm not an Idle.

44
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,900
And then you were like, Bree, go!

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,720
My rehearsal in my head didn't make sense.

46
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,120
Keep your enemies under toes.

47
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm Annex.

48
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm Puta Stern.

49
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm Puta.

50
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Hello, I'm Puta Juna Unagi from Idle EN's first generation.

51
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,100
I'm Kai.

52
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,840
I'm a EO bitch.

53
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,340
Nice.

54
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
That's really sweet.

55
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,080
That's better than me.

56
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,780
And I'm Doki Bird.

57
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,460
I think that's a good enough intro, I think.

58
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm short and thin enough.

59
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,800
It's great.

60
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm an Indie.

61
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,980
You're also not an Idle!

62
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,660
See you in Mixed-Up!

63
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,740
Who would've thought?

64
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,320
These guys, these guys, oh my gosh.

65
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,800
These guys, they came in here in this call like an hour before the stream started.

66
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,120
I was so not used to it.

67
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,240
I was like, looking at my Discord.

68
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,740
Because we have a Discord group for this collab.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,800
And they were like, guys, are you guys, were you gonna call now before the collab?

70
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,040
And I was like, what?

71
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,360
So we can set it up and everything.

72
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,680
And I was like, whoa.

73
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Yeah, because you gotta come in early so you can set everything up.

74
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,460
And then they're like, fuck, you have time to go.

75
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,660
By the way, you guys, I'm going to go.

76
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,660
I showed up 10 minutes.

77
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
I showed up 10 minutes before the stream started.

78
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,520
All these girls were in the call for an hour to 30 minutes.

79
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,340
And I was like, alright guys, I'm gonna be here in like 5-10 minutes, guys.

80
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,080
Kai, Rie, and I were just like shitting our pants like, oh my god, I can't believe Doki's fucking dead.

81
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm just gonna pass out.

82
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,960
It's been 30 minutes.

83
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,240
We have 30 minutes.

84
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,840
It's okay.

85
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,600
Yeah.

86
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,740
I was like, I wonder if she's sleeping.

87
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,220
Yeah, I was.

88
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,760
I actually was.

89
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,720
I was napping.

90
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,780
I was napping like napping for like 1 or 2 hours and I woke up like 30 minutes before the stream started and I was like, yay.

91
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,160
Oh, we don't need an hour.

92
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,660
And then we were actually calculating it and they were like, no, no, because she put her waiting room today.

93
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,780
Like, she's up, right?

94
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,540
Like, she's not sleeping.

95
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,440
And I'm like, I don't know, guys.

96
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,340
It could be scheduled.

97
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,820
I was so not used to this.

98
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,040
I was like, you guys fucking got ready to get in an hour before.

99
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,340
I'm so used to people showing up 10 minutes before the collab started.

100
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,140
I was like...

101
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,160
Kai and I were hanging out before the call so we were just, we just moved over to the...

102
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,440
And I came in and I was like, did you guys do the tutorial?

103
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,440
And they're like, no.

104
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,640
And I was like, oh, okay.

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,780
I was like, alright, so you guys, what were you guys prepping?

106
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,740
Listen, we're prepared, but not that prepared.

107
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,380
We're just prepping the vibes.

108
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,520
You know, we're just prepping.

109
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
I didn't do the tutorial.

110
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,200
I have an excuse for not doing the tutorial.

111
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,460
I showed up 10 minutes before the stream.

112
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,720
Well, should we get started and see how, like, shit our mics are in-game?

113
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,120
Oh, yeah.

114
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,680
By the way, there's, like, in-game mic.

115
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,920
So, like, my audio guy, my audio guy was like, everybody's balanced.

116
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,680
I was like, yeah, for now, but we're gonna be using in-game mic later.

117
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,300
So you gotta figure that stuff out soon.

118
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,960
Okay.

119
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,580
Are you guys ready?

120
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,880
Yep, I'm ready.

121
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:24,800
So, for those who don't know what this game is about, this is basically, apparently, for the people who tested this game an hour early, they told me it was, like, Dead by Daylight and Among Us mixed together.

122
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,560
So there's only one person who's a demon that's gonna kill all of us.

123
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,360
And I was the one that suggested the game because I saw there was a priest, and that was the only character I wanted to play.

124
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,060
So I was like, Kai was the priest when I got in the waiting room.

125
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,420
I was like, get the fuck off the priest.

126
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm only playing this game.

127
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,500
For the priest.

128
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,600
Get the fuck off it.

129
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,080
I got bullied!

130
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,580
I'm literally getting bullied!

131
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,820
I literally don't know what to say.

132
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,900
Please get off priest.

133
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,420
I've been looking for... No, I was like, GET OFF FUCKING PRIEST!

134
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,620
You were an invited guest!

135
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,180
Yeah, you're right.

136
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,100
I'm playing engineering.

137
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,020
I don't know why you would leave the tech stuff to me.

138
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,080
It's okay.

139
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,380
I believe...

140
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,640
I don't.

141
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,700
For the priest, I looked at the controls because I was nervous.

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,460
So I got...

143
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,960
I was sitting up at like 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

144
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,900
I was so ready.

145
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,600
It's 7 now.

146
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,260
Oh my god.

147
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,460
You guys are so prepared.

148
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,540
I'm so prepped.

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,540
I've never done this before in my life.

150
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,500
I've never had a...

151
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,580
I have not had a collapsed starting time in a long ass time.

152
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,000
I remember when it was like, you know, the designated time to start the stream.

153
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,080
They were like, Oh my god, guys, it's time to start the stream.

154
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,920
I looked at the time.

155
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,000
It was like 4pm.

156
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,740
I was like, what?

157
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,420
Not 4.10?

158
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040
Or 4.15?

159
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,020
We're at the starting at 4 exactly?

160
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,900
Oh my god.

161
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
We're spoiling you.

162
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,720
No, no.

163
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,240
It's okay.

164
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,780
I like the numbers.

165
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,220
You're real.

166
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,240
Please understand.

167
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,720
I was not ready for this.

168
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Are we all ready to go in?

169
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,360
Yeah.

170
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,040
Wait.

171
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,040
Are we meeting everyone?

172
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,020
How do we start it?

173
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,660
Oh, yeah.

174
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:07,920
Oh.

175
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,740
Go away.

176
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,040
I'm gonna meet you guys.

177
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,380
Okay, bye.

178
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,280
Alright.

179
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,260
Here we go.

180
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,720
Whoa.

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,640
Press...

182
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:18,900
Hello?

183
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,840
I hear you.

184
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,920
Hello!

185
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,840
Oh my god.

186
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,460
You're the priest.

187
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,220
I'm the priest.

188
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,480
Okay, we gotta get... We have prep time.

189
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,240
It's like Batman.

190
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,060
We have prep time.

191
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,060
Okay, there's a shockwave.

192
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,020
Oh my gosh.

193
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,280
Maybe we should have done the tutorial.

194
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,920
What are all of these?

195
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,300
Oh my god.

196
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,860
Oh my god.

197
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:40,980
Oh my god.

198
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,660
I have stats?

199
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,920
I can adjust my skills?

200
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,300
Oh no.

201
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,840
Right click.

202
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,740
Oh, I want the dove.

203
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,420
I want the power of the dove.

204
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,380
We don't have enough XP.

205
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,620
Oh no.

206
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,380
What did I grab?

207
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,120
Orbs.

208
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,380
That spin around you and weaken the... Okay, I got the orb.

209
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,580
I can only pick one.

210
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,680
Why do you have just these... You have a dove.

211
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,520
You have a... I have... I have the orb.

212
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,720
I have the orb.

213
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,680
Don't worry.

214
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,120
I have... I have the orb.

215
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,380
What the fuck?

216
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,180
How did you mute yourself?

217
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,620
Alright, here we go.

218
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,620
I don't know.

219
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,900
I can't... Alright, it's time to...

220
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,360
It's time to kill Juna.

221
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
We never liked her in the first place.

222
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,340
Right?

223
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,200
You would meet both of us.

224
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,560
You would meet both of us.

225
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,660
Here, I'll take pictures of the dead body.

226
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,820
That's looking right.

227
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,040
I just met... Okay, that's not a lie.

228
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,880
I didn't just meet her.

229
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,540
I met her at a convention.

230
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,180
I meet and greet.

231
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,180
But like...

232
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,180
But like, I heard...

233
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,900
Like, I was her oshi and I thought this would be the perfect time to kill her.

234
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,580
To say, never meet your heroes.

235
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,120
It would be such a great time.

236
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,540
Never meet your heroes.

237
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,440
I don't know what I'm saying.

238
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,480
She's gonna learn the hard way.

239
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,140
She's gonna learn the hard way.

240
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,240
Alright.

241
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,140
Wait, we do have objectives then.

242
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,020
We have?

243
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh shit, I was not...

244
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,060
Okay, find a crochet tool.

245
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,740
I need a crochet.

246
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,180
Unlock the armor door.

247
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,780
Fight evil spirits.

248
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,180
Woah!

249
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,960
Who the fuck is she?

250
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,080
Is that you, Juna?

251
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,180
Who is she?

252
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
No, I think it's an NPC.

253
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,180
There's NPCs?

254
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,960
Yeah, there's NPCs of...

255
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:39,260
The guy can disguise as NPCs and then eat other NPCs.

256
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,700
Wait, what the fuck is her mission?

257
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,280
But I don't know if Juna knows that she can do that.

258
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:42,980
Oh, she doesn't.

259
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,640
She didn't do the tutorial.

260
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,800
You were the only one that did the tutorial, so it's fine.

261
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,700
I'm prepared!

262
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,040
We have the only person that's...

263
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,740
Wait, hello?

264
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,320
Hey, lady.

265
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,940
Oh, there's meds!

266
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,200
Wait, there's meds.

267
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,620
Yeah, yeah.

268
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,820
I got the bandage.

269
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,960
I don't know how to use it, but I got the bandages.

270
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,700
Neither do I.

271
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,240
Oh, I can lock the doors too.

272
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,280
I can try demon beam.

273
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,180
Okay.

274
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,260
Wait, what's this?

275
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,140
Hiding...

276
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Exorcist can hide and beware the...

277
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,260
Oh!

278
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,070
Oh, you don't see me.

279
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,550
I need my protection device.

280
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,310
Guys!

281
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,790
Guys!

282
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,090
Juna's right here!

283
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:24,910
On my door!

284
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,650
She's soft!

285
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,350
She's soft!

286
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:27,930
That's Juna!

287
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,050
That's her!

288
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,050
Be gone!

289
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,230
Oh!

290
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,670
You're stunning all of us!

291
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,890
Oh, did I stun you?

292
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,030
I don't know.

293
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,270
No, I think I did.

294
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,450
Oh, oh, wait.

295
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,630
Is Kyle... Okay.

296
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,970
Okay, you... Sorry, I'm good.

297
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,250
Sorry.

298
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,070
Alright, we're fine.

299
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,750
Yeah, okay.

300
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,710
Juna's gone.

301
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,730
Okay, I know what she looks like now, though.

302
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:54,270
Wait.

303
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,590
Oh, wait.

304
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:55,930
I have this.

305
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,490
I found the crochet tool!

306
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,130
I found it!

307
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,830
Yeah, we gotta unlock the armor door with the pick tool.

308
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,370
Who has the pick tool?

309
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,610
Oh, wait.

310
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,770
Is the crochet...

311
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,610
Is the crochet tool the pick tool?

312
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,970
Oh, maybe that is.

313
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,270
Yeah.

314
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,430
Where the fuck is the door?

315
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,910
Guys, I think...

316
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,750
Guys, I have a feeling that maybe we should have done the tutorial.

317
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,250
Yeah, maybe.

318
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,910
I think we should have done the tutorial.

319
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,330
I need the tutorial and I'm lost.

320
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,990
Okay.

321
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,770
So, I don't know.

322
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,670
We'll be fine.

323
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,370
Because I'm like... I have so many...

324
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,850
I have so many...

325
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,770
I have so many items.

326
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,070
But I'm trying to figure out how to pull up my...

327
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,330
Oh, I...

328
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,370
Oh, if you press tab, you can pull up your items.

329
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,490
Oh, yeah.

330
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,790
I healed myself.

331
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,170
She's got pills.

332
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,690
That's it.

333
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,110
I don't think Juna knows what she's doing.

334
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:55,510
Nope.

335
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,270
I don't know.

336
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,930
Let me bring up my game volume a little bit.

337
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,690
Let me bring up my game volume a little bit.

338
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:01,810
Ooh.

339
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,030
Okay, I brought up my game volume.

340
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,470
You know, I thought this would be a lot scarier, but it's kind of not that bad.

341
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,530
It's not that bad.

342
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,210
I think it's also because we're grouped up together.

343
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:11,610
I don't know.

344
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,190
I saw...

345
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,390
I just got a tutorial on how to hide in a closet.

346
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,310
So, like...

347
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,250
I don't know if I should do that.

348
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,250
We need to find...

349
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,990
I think it's also easier right now because we're together.

350
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,890
So, we're not as close together.

351
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,190
I'm scared.

352
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,070
I think Juna does not know where the fuck we are.

353
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,970
Yeah, I'm sure.

354
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,130
Yeah, dude.

355
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,190
I think she's equally as lost.

356
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,610
Wait, no.

357
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:33,990
It's this.

358
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,110
Demon gets closer.

359
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,610
Wait, no.

360
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,230
I think she might be nearby.

361
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,170
Whoa.

362
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:38,770
Whoa.

363
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,330
Oh, I can't.

364
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,410
No, she's not.

365
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,750
Is she close?

366
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,550
Is she still close by?

367
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,470
Oh, I got no clue.

368
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,370
I have no idea what she looks like.

369
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,290
I kind of want her to...

370
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,370
What the fuck?

371
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:53,830
What's that?

372
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,590
Is that Juna?

373
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,090
Is that you?

374
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:56,690
I threw it.

375
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,770
Yes, the anti-invisible potion.

376
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,610
She can't be invisible in here.

377
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,150
Because apparently she can be invisible.

378
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,430
Oh, wait.

379
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,290
There's a ladder here.

380
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,790
Whoa.

381
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,350
Guys.

382
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,210
I got a ladder.

383
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,130
Oh, it was...

384
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,270
I don't know what to do with it.

385
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,170
I just got the ladder.

386
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,630
Oh, there's more bandages.

387
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,310
Wait, wait, wait.

388
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,170
Bree.

389
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:18,770
Whoa.

390
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,290
Okay, she inked.

391
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:21,770
I got scared.

392
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,190
Okay.

393
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,050
It's just some old woman.

394
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,450
Okay, okay.

395
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,030
Take the bandage.

396
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,210
Take the bandage.

397
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,990
And like, heal.

398
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,430
Press tab and then click on the...

399
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,690
Click on your bandage.

400
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,770
Oh my god.

401
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,230
Am I injured?

402
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,510
Yes, you are.

403
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,510
Look at your HP.

404
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:39,970
What?

405
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,990
What do you mean, am I injured?

406
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,170
I didn't know.

407
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,530
Bro, Juna must be so funny.

408
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,130
I mean, she's fucking...

409
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,990
She looks good.

410
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,830
She is like so fucking confused.

411
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,550
I wonder if there's like...

412
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,070
Wait, wait, stand still.

413
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,270
I'm gonna use this gun on you.

414
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:55,910
Ow.

415
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:56,750
Ow.

416
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,830
What?

417
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:01,550
Yes.

418
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,350
What the fuck?

419
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,870
I thought it was you.

420
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,830
What the fuck?

421
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,270
Well, don't keep doing it.

422
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,190
Don't keep... I'm fucking healing myself right now.

423
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,630
Oh, thank god.

424
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:11,910
Okay.

425
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,250
There you go.

426
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:12,530
There you go.

427
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,310
Well, you had a little bit left, so I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna hurt you.

428
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,390
Don't make me use this.

429
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,770
Wait, what?

430
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,230
Wait, she was next to us!

431
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,090
She was next to us!

432
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:23,890
What?

433
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,130
Was that her?

434
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:25,870
Yeah!

435
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,790
Yeah, we fought!

436
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,550
Oh my god!

437
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,850
Oh my god!

438
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,250
Bro!

439
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,410
I can't believe it.

440
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,990
I wanted to hurt you guys, but then I'm right here.

441
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,790
Task failed successfully.

442
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,370
If only I had made this much of a wrench gun, it would have been great.

443
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,590
Oh my god.

444
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,030
We would go downstairs for it.

445
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,130
We have to find some armor door shit.

446
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,250
Where's the armor door?

447
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,690
My gamer senses was tingling.

448
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,630
Oh, don't worry.

449
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,250
Watch this.

450
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,590
Demon is getting closer.

451
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,430
We're okay.

452
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,610
She's not close enough.

453
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,870
Whoa, this is spooky.

454
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,910
Where's the power?

455
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,030
What the fuck?

456
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,850
Did you ink again?

457
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,710
Okay.

458
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,330
Okay.

459
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,630
I was gonna say, did you ink again?

460
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,950
I'm sorry.

461
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,750
You can't just keep throwing those at everyone.

462
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,830
I can't.

463
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,510
Wait, you have unlimited?

464
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,210
Actual menace.

465
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,950
You have unlimited?

466
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,470
There's like a regen.

467
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,290
Oh yeah, me too.

468
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,450
I do too.

469
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,870
Invincibility.

470
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,570
What is that?

471
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,970
That has to be an NPC, right?

472
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,750
Yeah.

473
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,630
Yeah, cause I hit him with my anti-demonic beam.

474
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,650
Yeah, I don't think that's an NPC.

475
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,330
Yeah, that's not her.

476
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,610
That's an NPC right here.

477
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,430
Oh my god, where the fuck...

478
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,810
Stop shooting me with the surprise!

479
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,270
AHHHHH!

480
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,050
RECOUN!

481
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,450
Oh, that's him.

482
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:10,870
That's him.

483
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,390
Okay, okay.

484
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,690
Oh, I can't see.

485
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,230
Oh, F, F, F, press F.

486
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:14,830
Flashlight.

487
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,790
Okay, here we go.

488
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,310
I'm doing it.

489
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,410
Where's the circuit breaker?

490
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:18,950
I did it!

491
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,530
I did it!

492
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,230
The circuit breaker.

493
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,730
Okay, alright, alright.

494
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,750
It's okay, Chiwo is gone.

495
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,590
I fucking...

496
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,250
Suck it!

497
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,110
Suck it, dude!

498
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,730
I said be gone and she disappeared.

499
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,170
Oh my god.

500
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,490
Guys!

501
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,290
One of you guys must have played this game.

502
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,830
In my chat.

503
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,610
Where's the...

504
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,210
We must have one person that plays this game.

505
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,170
Please!

506
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:47,910
I'm so lost.

507
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,310
You have exercised a demon, right?

508
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,450
I'm so lost.

509
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,750
I should not be leading anybody in this game.

510
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,490
I don't know where anything is.

511
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,410
I wanna go outside!

512
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,250
I wanna go outside!

513
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,150
Oh my god!

514
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,250
Wait, what's this?

515
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,850
Oh, this thing, they heal at this thing.

516
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,810
This is the thing that when we enter them, she has to go back here.

517
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,790
Tutorial!

518
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,570
Yippee!

519
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,570
I think that just leads out to...

520
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,570
Someone said... I just realized...

521
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,470
I have a syringe and I have a syringe gun.

522
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,410
And I was using the syringe gun on you.

523
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,410
Oh my fucking... Heal me!

524
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,130
Stop!

525
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,230
Oh my god, please!

526
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,350
You're not healing!

527
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,530
No, you're not!

528
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,990
What are you doing?

529
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,910
Alright, let's make sure that no one's near us while you do this.

530
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,930
Okay, here...

531
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,150
I did say she was getting closer.

532
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,090
What the fuck did you do?

533
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,810
That did nothing.

534
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:45,670
Well, you have a shield now.

535
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,050
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

536
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,450
Oh...

537
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,170
Hey, I think she's close by.

538
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,650
I see like...

539
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,310
Be gone!

540
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,250
Oh my god, I can't fucking see now.

541
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,050
I know!

542
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,410
It's the anti-invisibility, but also with the anti-sight.

543
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,210
It's the anti-invisibility, but also with the anti-sight.

544
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:06,270
Is this her?

545
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,150
Wait, that is her!

546
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,010
What the fuck?

547
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:09,990
Be gone!

548
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,230
Be gone!

549
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,610
Be gone!

550
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,010
Wait, no, that's not her!

551
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,990
That's an NPC!

552
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,690
That's an NPC!

553
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,510
This NPC was like, help!

554
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,770
This group of girls are gay and beating me up!

555
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,430
We fucking beat up an old man!

556
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,010
Oh no!

557
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,270
We beat up some...

558
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,510
She took damage!

559
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,570
What the fuck?

560
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,430
That was her!

561
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,730
Wait, are you okay?

562
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,730
Oh, she's not okay!

563
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,150
Get up!

564
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,590
I did that!

565
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,390
Yo, you can get up, don't be a little bitch!

566
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,330
I beat you up!

567
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,570
I'm gonna beat you up!

568
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,550
What are you doing?

569
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,570
What are you doing?

570
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,290
Be gone!

571
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,470
I'll do it!

572
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,730
You're ugly as hell!

573
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,470
Be gone!

574
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,950
Oh shit!

575
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,730
Bro, she's beating us up!

576
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,610
Bro!

577
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,970
This sucks!

578
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,890
Why can't we, like...

579
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,570
I think she's like, they possessed him.

580
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,230
Oh shit!

581
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,090
I think it's cause like...

582
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,950
She's taking damage.

583
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,930
You can see on her HP that she's taking damage.

584
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,410
Don't worry, I'm getting coming over!

585
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,710
You can't hide from us!

586
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,210
Drewna, we're gonna kill you!

587
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,590
Get over here!

588
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,610
I have more spells!

589
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,770
Get over here!

590
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,030
Look at her run!

591
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,210
She's right here in front of me!

592
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,290
Be gone!

593
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:36,990
Get over here!

594
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,430
Get over here!

595
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,370
Bro!

596
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,290
She's fucked up!

597
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:42,990
She's fucked up!

598
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,150
Oh, she disappeared!

599
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,870
She went invisible!

600
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,310
Wait, I have a thing for this!

601
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,530
She's gone!

602
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,970
What a little bitch!

603
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,990
This is such a bad end line!

604
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,970
Okay, I'll save her.

605
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,130
Don't worry, God is in you.

606
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,190
Don't worry.

607
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,670
I saved her.

608
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,610
Yay!

609
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,870
Get up, stupid!

610
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,270
Don't worry, not believe in God.

611
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,210
I'm a fucking loser.

612
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,030
Wait, I see her!

613
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,930
She's like right here!

614
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,030
Drewna, I see you!

615
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,590
Yes!

616
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,290
Where did she go?

617
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,690
I saw her fucking...

618
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,150
I don't know.

619
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,210
I like how we gave up on the armored door.

620
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,990
Oh, yeah!

621
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,290
Wait, can I heal you?

622
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,950
God, you're healed!

623
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,710
Please, actually use your syringe.

624
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,330
I don't!

625
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:35,770
Please!

626
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,950
Use your syringe!

627
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,450
Wait!

628
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,330
Bro, are you kidding me?

629
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,710
She's losing HP!

630
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,390
What are you doing?

631
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,630
I think I know what to do!

632
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,870
I'd rather have Drewna kill me at this point.

633
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,610
Oh, I see her.

634
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,550
I see her.

635
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,550
She's right here outside this door.

636
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,310
She's right here.

637
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,550
Oh, there she's coming!

638
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,030
She's coming!

639
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:00,710
Oh, no!

640
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,970
Bro, are you a medic?

641
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,830
Where did you get your fucking degree?

642
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,510
You can't...

643
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,290
You literally...

644
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,730
You literally have one job!

645
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,910
Your one job is to heal us!

646
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,830
But I can choke some birds!

647
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,670
What the fuck?

648
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,410
She's not being healed!

649
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,770
She lost half of HP because you shot her!

650
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,130
I thought everyone was certified at the same time!

651
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:32,910
Oh, my God.

652
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:33,710
Okay, look.

653
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,310
As someone that's not a priest, here's to take these pills and heal yourself.

654
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,270
As someone that's not a priest, here's to take these pills and heal yourself.

655
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,850
I wasted all my pills on myself as well.

656
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,150
Oh, my God.

657
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,530
Wait, I have three.

658
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,090
How do I...

659
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,070
You just left-click it.

660
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,050
What are you doing?

661
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,250
These pills aren't for you!

662
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,110
Nope!

663
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,510
You're the one that needs HP!

664
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,090
I can take some too!

665
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,330
Look, I'm better now!

666
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,830
Please.

667
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,190
What are you doing?

668
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,170
What the fuck are you doing?

669
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,650
I'm trying to figure out...

670
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,010
Guys, take the HP!

671
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,570
Three.

672
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,370
Three.

673
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,170
I'm trying to...

674
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,110
I'm trying to heal you!

675
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,190
Three, for the love of God!

676
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,490
Ask your chat how to play your character for the love of God!

677
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,750
For the love of God!

678
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,790
I'm just putting the word sad in the chat!

679
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,590
I'm just putting the word sad in the chat!

680
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:24,650
I'm just putting the word sad in the chat!

681
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,170
Can you hold?

682
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,510
Just hold the needle!

683
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,190
Oh, my God.

684
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:30,290
Wait.

685
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,310
That's a good idea.

686
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,730
Have you not been holding?

687
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,010
Oh, my God.

688
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,810
I have a gun!

689
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,670
Holy shit.

690
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,370
Stop!

691
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,090
We have limited heals!

692
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,010
How is Juna taking damage?

693
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,970
None of us are doing anything!

694
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,670
She lost half...

695
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,010
She lost one third of her HP!

696
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,750
She lost so much!

697
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,130
Holy shit.

698
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,810
Okay.

699
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,850
What do you mean, it won't?

700
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,750
What do you mean?

701
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,250
You haven't done anything!

702
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,210
You haven't done anything!

703
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,030
You haven't done anything!

704
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,910
My game volume so far...

705
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,350
That was the game volume so far, guys.

706
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,790
We have... where is the armory door?

707
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,090
Yeah, no.

708
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,730
I'm trying to find it too, but I don't see anything.

709
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,890
Like I just don't know...

710
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,450
Oh, wait.

711
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,210
Well, I think maybe...

712
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,730
...do you think it's in the basement?

713
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:27,990
Oh, yeah.

714
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,730
It could be.

715
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,390
It's always in the basement.

716
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,290
Oh, my God.

717
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,510
Where is it?

718
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,470
Oh, dude, holy shit.

719
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,010
You're so smart.

720
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,530
Oh my god.

721
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,130
Oh my god.

722
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,810
Wait, Tara, I found it!

723
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,830
I found it!

724
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,530
I found it!

725
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,450
Wait, I think so?

726
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,650
I'm right here, follow my boys!

727
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,990
Guys, I don't think Juna knows there's a basement.

728
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,630
Guys, I don't think Juna knows there's a basement.

729
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,010
We're so, we're so, we're so okay.

730
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,550
Okay, there's hope.

731
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,710
There's no way she knows there's a basement.

732
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,210
Wait, wait, wait, we have to go back down.

733
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,150
That's the outside.

734
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:14,490
Okay.

735
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,430
No, no, there has to be an armored door.

736
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,350
Wait, what's this?

737
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,070
I found it!

738
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,210
How the f- Oh, I found it!

739
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,070
Guys, guys, I'm a priest.

740
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,490
I don't know how to do lockpicking.

741
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,670
How the fuck?

742
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:29,950
How the?

743
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,010
What?

744
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:31,990
Oh, I did it!

745
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,050
How the?

746
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,050
What?

747
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,650
Oh, I did it!

748
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:34,790
What?

749
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,310
I did it!

750
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,950
I don't know what I did!

751
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,330
Oh my god, there's- Oh my god, there's evil- Oh my god, turn around, there's a thing here!

752
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,230
Oh my god!

753
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:44,370
Begone!

754
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,990
Ow, I'm taking damage!

755
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,250
How do I?

756
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,370
Begone!

757
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,030
How do I?

758
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,050
Oh my god, I took so much damage.

759
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,950
Wait, wait, wait, go, go, go, wait, wait.

760
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,630
Go in!

761
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,550
Go in!

762
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:55,550
Begone!

763
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:58,930
BEGONE!

764
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,210
Guys, I'm not doing anything.

765
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:02,870
BEGONE!

766
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,870
Guys, I'm not doing anything in this room.

767
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,450
I...

768
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,690
Oh, I'm doing it!

769
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,090
I'm doing it!

770
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,350
I'm saying stuff in my book!

771
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,250
I stopped saying things in my book, guys.

772
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,170
Oh, wait, are you?

773
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,330
Oh, okay.

774
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,870
Wait, one of them is gone!

775
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,130
Wait, I think you were doing... I think it was your job!

776
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,990
I think it was your job!

777
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,150
Yeah, you fucking zapped!

778
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,750
You like, ghost busted that shit!

779
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,910
Yeah, I'm not doing anything, guys.

780
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:34,930
Yeah, I'm not doing anything, guys.

781
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,590
Yeah, yeah, you were ghost busting.

782
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:38,950
Yeah, yeah, you were ghost busting.

783
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,430
Yeah, it was you!

784
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,490
Oh my god, it was you!

785
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,730
That was your job!

786
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,170
Okay, okay.

787
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,250
Okay.

788
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,030
Okay.

789
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,470
Okay, I have bandages.

790
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,130
Okay, the priest has bandages!

791
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,510
Guys, get over here!

792
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,510
What are you doing here, Juna?

793
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,490
Leave, Juna!

794
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,810
We're doing our thing!

795
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,170
Guys!

796
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,190
Guys, guys, come over here!

797
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:05,890
I have bandages!

798
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:07,930
Guys!

799
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,950
Guys, get over here!

800
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,530
I have bandages!

801
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,170
I have bandages right here!

802
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,570
I have bandages right here!

803
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,130
Yeah, yeah, let me push up the game then.

804
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,070
I have...

805
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

806
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,390
Alright, let me...

807
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,790
Feel it.

808
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,350
Alright, heal so you can get rid of the last guy.

809
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,350
We need you to get rid of the last ghost!

810
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,990
Literally, that's all we have to do.

811
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,010
Get fucked!

812
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:35,350
Get fucked!

813
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,730
Get fucked!

814
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,970
You're good.

815
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,870
Yeah, I'll just exist here.

816
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,650
I'll just get rid of JUNA for you.

817
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,310
Get away from us, Juna!

818
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:49,770
Get away!

819
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,450
Go away!

820
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,110
Go away!

821
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,670
We're doing our job!

822
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,390
What are you doing, Juna?

823
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,530
What the fuck?

824
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,030
There she is!

825
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,590
I think I got them!

826
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,030
Oh, shoot!

827
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:02,730
Yeah!

828
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,450
Demonic Altar's been destroyed!

829
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,710
We did it!

830
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,370
Yeah, yeah!

831
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,090
We have more?

832
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,650
You know, I'm just...

833
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,490
Lighting!

834
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,090
Oh my god!

835
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,790
Oh, wait, wait!

836
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,450
I have matches!

837
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:12,970
I have matches!

838
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,590
We can... I can... We just need to find the altar.

839
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,250
Yeah!

840
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:16,910
Wait, me too!

841
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

842
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,570
We just gotta go find the altar.

843
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,550
Where that is.

845
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,210
Yeah, find the altars.

846
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,450
I feel like we saw the altars on the second floor.

847
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,730
I'm shielding you.

848
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,010
Okay, I feel like...

849
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,210
Having a medic is like, useless.

850
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,590
What the fuck?

851
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,670
Oh, my medic doesn't shoot us.

852
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,090
I'm just trying to assist!

853
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,310
I just saw the button!

854
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,550
I'm doing something!

855
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,430
What the fuck?!

856
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,090
No, you're not!

857
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,250
You are not doing anything!

858
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,150
What the fuck?!

859
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,030
Be good!

860
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,830
Be good!

861
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,350
Oh, no!

862
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,910
Oh, my God!

863
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,390
You are definitely not doing anything!

864
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,880
Oh, my God!

865
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,860
Let me save this...

866
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,240
Believe in God!

867
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,600
I don't know, I feel like...

868
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,040
I feel like they give us...

869
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,040
Why?

870
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,440
I don't know.

871
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,700
What?

872
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,260
No morals!

873
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,460
I need a benefit!

874
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,620
Woah.

875
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
Oh, he's just...

876
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,800
Bro, that's not...

877
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,860
He's just a normal guy.

878
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,640
He's just a nor...

879
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,060
Yeah, man.

880
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,260
What the...

881
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,660
What?

882
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,020
What?

883
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,320
What?

884
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,020
Fuck.

885
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,380
The demon took its final form... for one minute!

886
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:44,860
Hide!

887
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,800
Shh!

888
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,740
Where's the closet?

889
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,520
Oh no.

890
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,380
Oh no.

891
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,280
Oh no.

892
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Oh no.

893
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:53,940
Oh no.

894
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,020
I don't know...

895
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,590
Guys, I think we'll be okay guys.

896
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,130
Can you hear me?

897
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,450
There's no way, right?

898
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,590
There's...

899
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,910
There's no way, right?

900
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,330
That they can hear me.

901
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,810
Right, guys?

902
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,850
We'll be okay.

903
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:31,960
Shhhh.

904
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,720
Shhhh.

905
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,580
The team is no longer invincible!

906
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,500
We're okay!

907
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,740
Guys!

908
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,020
He's no longer invincible!

909
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,980
Guys?

910
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,440
Guys?

911
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,260
Wait, I think Kai's dead.

912
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,580
Guys, I think Kai's dead.

913
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,120
Hello?

914
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,960
You did your job!

915
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,080
You actually did your job!

916
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,540
I don't know where you are, but I can see Kai is not dead anymore.

917
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,680
Did you figure out how to be a medic now?

918
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,240
Did you finally figure it out?

919
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,380
Apparently, I can only be a medic if you're dead.

920
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,200
Alright, now we know.

921
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,020
It's okay!

922
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,320
It's okay!

923
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,140
She's not invincible!

924
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,600
Okay, okay.

925
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,360
Don't worry.

926
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,420
She's literally 1 HP.

927
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,020
You cannot shoot her anymore.

928
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,300
You actually can't shoot her anymore.

929
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,300
She's literally 1 HP right now.

930
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,580
You cannot do that.

931
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,520
We gotta find...

932
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,100
I feel like we've seen the altar before.

933
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,920
Okay, I'm gonna lock... I'm gonna start locking doors.

934
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,040
Wait, there's a meds!

935
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,420
There's meds!

936
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,020
Take the meds!

937
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,900
Wait, I think... I think I remember there being like a... It was like a room.

938
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,300
It was like downstairs and it was like a table in the middle of the floor and that was it.

939
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,240
Yeah, yeah, that has to be!

940
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,320
Why would there be a table in the middle of the floor?

941
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,680
That has to be!

942
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,880
Alright, let's see.

943
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,180
I'm gone.

944
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,820
Just in case.

945
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,800
I gotta be sure.

946
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,140
Are you sure?

947
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:34,860
Are you sure?

948
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,200
Okay, look.

949
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,280
I'm not feeling so confident.

950
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,520
She's like the our only lead right now, so...

951
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:39,940
Yeah!

952
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,280
Oh my god!

953
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,660
Okay, okay.

954
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,200
I think it's my job.

955
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,360
Okay, wait, wait.

956
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,840
Whose job is this?

957
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,740
Whose job is this?

958
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,660
Is this my job?

959
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,120
How do I light it?

960
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,840
Light the... I locked the door.

961
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,840
I locked the door so she can't get in.

962
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,340
I don't think.

963
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,540
How do we do this?

964
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,220
We should be fine, but...

965
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,380
Whose job is this?

966
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:01,960
Oh my god.

967
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,420
Oh, I don't know.

968
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,420
Wait, wait, wait.

969
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,840
This is the ritual table.

970
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,020
Wait, wait, wait.

971
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,340
It's placed the parchment on the ritual table.

972
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,140
Oh, that's the ritual.

973
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,580
Okay, this is not a...

974
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,200
I take back the celebratory gunshot.

975
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,320
Okay, that's not the...

976
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,620
We know where it is though.

977
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,100
Okay, we know where it is.

978
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,040
Okay, someone marked... Okay, remember this, Bri.

979
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,040
You gotta remember this.

980
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,400
You're literally our only hope.

981
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,040
I'm genuinely awful with directions.

982
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,620
I get lost in strings always.

983
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,500
Okay, that's terrible because so am I.

984
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,520
Okay, so...

985
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,440
This is bad.

986
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,100
Wait, what's this?

987
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,600
Is this?

988
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,520
Is this?

989
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,120
We found it!

990
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,980
We got it!

991
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,860
This is what we look like.

992
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,800
This is what they look like.

993
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,420
Okay, they're basically a table.

994
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,280
We know what they look like now.

995
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,740
And there was like a flag on it.

996
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

997
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,040
We know what they look like now.

998
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:49,500
Oh, the range was not far enough.

999
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:49,920
Sorry.

1000
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,180
Oh, there he is!

1001
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,520
Oh my god.

1002
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,800
Give me a sec.

1003
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,580
I'm gonna cool down.

1004
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,300
I'm gonna cool down.

1005
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,120
Oh, you're gonna protect Kai.

1006
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,580
Okay.

1007
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,380
Kai is a whole centimeter from death.

1008
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,120
Be gone!

1009
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,020
Okay, he's not here.

1010
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,620
She's not here.

1011
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,920
She's not here.

1012
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,740
Okay, she's not here.

1013
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,480
Oh, goodbye, Kai.

1014
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,560
Oh, goodbye.

1015
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,080
She just punches me to death.

1016
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,120
Wait.

1017
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,000
Be gone!

1018
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,000
This is unfair.

1019
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,860
Like, I wanna fight back.

1020
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,460
I think I'm the only one that can fight back.

1021
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,640
I'm pretty sure.

1022
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,060
You're actually higher HP now.

1023
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,960
I have a few, like, buffing or, like, debuff.

1024
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
I can slow her down.

1025
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,660
And then my gunshot is apparently good against her.

1026
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:51,060
I'm pretty sure, like, the engineer is, like, the one that actually does all the exorcism stuff.

1027
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,640
And I'm just here to fight the demon.

1028
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,500
Be gone!

1029
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,060
Be gone!

1030
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,700
Get embarrassed.

1031
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,240
Get embarrassed.

1032
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:01,760
Yeah.

1033
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,200
Did you just take a photo?

1034
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,540
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1035
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,320
I found it!

1036
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,900
I found the altar!

1037
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,800
I found it!

1038
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,240
I found one!

1039
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,320
We just need one more!

1040
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,000
Show it to her later.

1041
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,560
She'll cry.

1042
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,480
We just need one more!

1043
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,100
Whoa!

1044
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,260
What does that mean?

1045
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,220
What, what, what, what?

1046
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,140
What?

1047
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,780
There's a sound?

1048
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,540
I heard, like, a thunk.

1049
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,660
I didn't hear anything.

1050
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,420
I don't know.

1051
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,060
I don't know.

1052
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,400
I think you're a fucking paranoid right now.

1053
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,140
We literally just need one more.

1054
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,860
Where the fuck is the last altar?

1055
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,060
It has to be on this floor.

1056
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,340
Dude...

1057
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,740
It has to be on this floor.

1058
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,120
Who the fuck was that?

1059
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,090
I know God.

1060
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,130
Be gone!

1061
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,070
Is she... Is she gone now?

1062
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,830
Oh, she's gone.

1063
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,630
Guys, we're back here.

1064
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,170
Guys, we're back here.

1065
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,310
Okay, she is not a coward.

1066
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,850
She was not a coward.

1067
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,210
Boom!

1068
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,990
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1069
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,970
Watch this, watch this, watch this.

1070
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:56,330
Come on.

1071
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,370
That's fucking right.

1072
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,270
Okay.

1073
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,500
What the fuck are you doing?

1074
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,760
What the fuck are you doing?

1075
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,660
Oh, my God!

1076
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,340
Get around!

1077
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,040
Oh, my God, what is she doing?

1078
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,820
What?

1079
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,680
How could you do that?

1080
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,940
I'll fucking stab you!

1081
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,160
She's going after me.

1082
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,860
She gave you a freebie, bro.

1083
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,580
Bro, that was like a fucking strip club or something.

1084
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,680
We were like at a bachelor party and we hired Juna to have...

1085
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,560
We were like, hey, yeah...

1086
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,660
She was like...

1087
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,280
She was like straddling your waist.

1088
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:44,760
Yeah.

1089
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:50,600
And then I felt like we were at a bachelor party and we're like giving you a nice like birthday party.

1090
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,360
One last day before your hitch, bro.

1091
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,260
Juna would.

1092
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,960
Juna would, honestly.

1093
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,660
On my end, it literally just looks like she's beating the shit out of me.

1094
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,580
I'm trying so hard.

1095
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,580
I'm trying so hard to heal you.

1096
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,860
Oh my god.

1097
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,600
Okay, we need one more.

1098
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,560
There has to be the last fucking alter.

1099
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,880
We probably like ran around it like a million times.

1100
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,720
We probably have.

1101
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,940
I found one of them.

1102
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,580
Should we?

1103
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,720
I hate to say it.

1104
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,120
Should we split up?

1105
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,220
Okay, how about like since you're...

1106
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,260
Should we?

1107
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:21,700
No!

1108
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,360
That's what they say in every freaking horror movie ever.

1109
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,920
Okay, Bri should stick with Kai because Kai's the most fucked up right now.

1110
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,640
I'll just heal you.

1111
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,700
Okay, I don't have healers.

1112
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,220
Okay.

1113
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,760
Okay, if I...

1114
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,260
Okay.

1115
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,200
I thought she was gonna say something.

1116
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,580
Don't worry.

1117
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,340
I'll split up with you guys and you two find the last alter.

1118
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,100
Alright, you guys ready?

1119
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,060
I'm the only one...

1120
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,260
I believe in you.

1121
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:40,680
Okay.

1122
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,920
Alright, I'm going this way.

1123
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,740
Just start screaming.

1124
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,700
Yeah, don't worry.

1125
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,320
Okay.

1126
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,580
I believe in you guys.

1127
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,120
Don't go, Kai.

1128
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,540
Come on.

1129
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,060
I'm gonna see if there's an alter at the top floor.

1130
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,400
Oh, well, come again.

1131
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,160
Alright, we'll go this way.

1132
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,640
Yeah, you guys look at the bottom floor.

1133
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,300
Face it.

1134
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:52,700
Yeah, sure, sure.

1135
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:53,540
Okay.

1136
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,280
Just keep talking because I can still hear you guys on the second floor.

1137
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,640
Okay, I can't hear them anymore on the second floor.

1138
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,300
I guess that was not true.

1139
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,160
Guys, I can't hear them anymore.

1140
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,400
Guys, I sadly cannot hear them.

1141
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,620
I know what their HP is like.

1142
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,860
Oh my god.

1143
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,240
Brie is almost...

1144
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,680
Can Brie heal herself?

1145
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,360
Brie can...

1146
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,080
We did it!

1147
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,240
Oh my god!

1148
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,960
It literally spawned next to me!

1149
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,500
Guys!

1150
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,580
Guys!

1151
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,080
Oh my god!

1152
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,400
I'm gonna lock the door!

1153
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,220
Guys!

1154
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,170
Are you guys alive?

1155
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,410
Guys!

1156
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,390
Guys, guys, guys!

1157
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,150
I found the parchment!

1158
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,230
Guys!

1159
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,870
I don't know where it is.

1160
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,210
I'm downstairs!

1161
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:00,810
Downstairs!

1162
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:01,210
Guys!

1163
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,310
Downstairs!

1164
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:02,670
Oh!

1165
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,810
I found the parchment!

1166
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,410
I found the parchment!

1167
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,770
It literally spawned next to me when you guys found the altar!

1168
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:07,890
Oh, nice!

1169
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,330
Okay, we gotta go to the other place!

1170
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,390
Okay, Brie, Brie, Brie, where is it?

1171
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:11,590
Where is it?

1172
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,470
Where is the thing?

1173
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,350
We gotta go this way and then dining room table.

1174
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:15,650
Okay.

1175
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,930
Okay, okay, okay.

1176
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:17,470
And then...

1177
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,730
I don't...

1178
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,410
Uh...

1179
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,990
You don't know where you're going, do you?

1180
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:21,910
Uh...

1181
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,850
No, this way?

1182
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,910
No, I have confidence.

1183
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,710
No, no, no, no.

1184
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,730
I always go this way.

1185
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:26,370
This way.

1186
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,870
This way.

1187
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,650
And then this way.

1188
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,730
Because we're back in the main lobby.

1189
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:36,470
Oh my god, we're so good at this game.

1190
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,650
There we go.

1191
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,310
Trina must have been so fucking confused.

1192
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,810
Be gone, demon!

1193
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,750
You have lost four...

1194
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,770
A demonic altar has been destroyed.

1195
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,730
Wait, I can...

1196
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,090
Oh my god, I forgot.

1197
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,470
Wait, I can heal.

1198
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,130
Are your teammates two times faster during agony?

1199
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:58,690
Observation!

1200
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,930
What the fuck?

1201
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,710
Wait, I can heal.

1202
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,010
I can heal.

1203
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:02,730
Remember to recharge your observation...

1204
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:03,770
We don't need full skills to heal.

1205
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:03,890
Holy sh...

1206
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:03,970
Yeah!

1207
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:10,070
I'm going to be like, wait, we could have been like, working on upgrading ourselves.

1208
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:10,690
Wait.

1209
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,210
Oh my god.

1210
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:13,730
Oh no...

1211
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:14,490
Okay.

1212
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:14,710
You need to do this one first.

1213
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,530
I max out on attack.

1214
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,050
I'm going to...

1215
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:16,650
Oh my god, there are so many.

1216
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,310
Okay.

1217
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:17,850
Defense.

1218
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,870
I'm going to put...

1219
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,690
You, like, attack.

1220
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,410
How do I...

1221
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:22,690
Like, appearing attack...

1222
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,150
Recharge your heal mana?

1223
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,770
How do I heal?

1224
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,730
I don't know!

1225
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,410
What do you mean, recharge my heal...

1226
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:30,670
My healing mana...

1227
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:30,750
Oh, man!

1228
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,810
I know, I think she's outside.

1229
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,650
I think she's outside.

1230
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,510
I think she is.

1231
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,150
Wait, maybe if I like...

1232
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,490
Alright, here we go, let's see.

1233
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,330
Oh, she left.

1234
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,370
Okay, she left.

1235
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,610
Okay, I swear to god she was out.

1236
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,270
Oh my god, I'm getting so used to this.

1237
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,370
I'm helping her!

1238
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,670
I feel like...

1239
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,370
Oh my god, putting it more on... I'm gonna put it on defense.

1240
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,390
Fuck this.

1241
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,290
Alright, we got by.

1242
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,130
She's climbing the fucking...

1243
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:30,450
She must be like, why can't I kill them?

1244
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,270
Oh my god.

1245
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,950
Are you just hiding?

1246
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,270
Oh, the breaker!

1247
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,870
Eddie, do your job!

1248
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,990
Oh my god, she chucked it at me!

1249
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,730
God, she's fucking getting closer!

1250
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,150
Get away!

1251
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,090
Be gone!

1252
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,030
Okay, I think I got... Bree, Bree, we need you.

1253
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,890
Bree, get out of the fucking closet!

1254
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,560
We've been fucking fighting for our lives and she's still...

1255
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,140
Bree, I swear...

1256
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,800
I'm not sure if Yuna's going after... not going after me because I'm just not a threat.

1257
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,480
I'm just not helpful at all.

1258
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,740
Oh!

1259
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,420
Wait, wait!

1260
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,180
She's almost in!

1261
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,920
She's almost in!

1262
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,400
Wait, I can kill her!

1263
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,380
Oh, we got her!

1264
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:19,820
We got her!

1265
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,240
I got her!

1266
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:20,660
I got her!

1267
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:20,840
I got her!

1268
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,080
We got her!

1269
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,320
We can actually kill her!

1270
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,860
We can actually kill her!

1271
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:24,500
We got her on the run!

1272
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,740
Where is she?

1273
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,560
Oh hey, what's this?

1274
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,040
Oh, that's one of the...

1275
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,800
Oh, oh.

1276
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,720
Wait for the wolves to enter the circle.

1277
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,120
She's actually stumbling by the goal.

1278
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,240
Wait, we have to like... we have to find the meat.

1279
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,320
We gotta go get the meat.

1280
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:37,940
Where the fuck is the freezer?

1281
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,480
Okay.

1282
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,800
It has to be up top, right?

1283
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,920
I mean, I assume it's in the...

1284
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,840
The kitchen, right?

1285
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,140
I assume it's either in the basement or it's in the kitchen.

1286
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:47,500
Yeah.

1287
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,080
Did you just burn the bird?

1288
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:49,560
Yeah, yeah.

1289
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,360
Fuck that bird.

1290
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,040
Did you just attack the bird?

1291
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,980
Fuck the... What has that bird done for us?

1292
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,960
I mean, the kitchen was up top.

1293
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:56,880
My kitchen was over here.

1294
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,620
Yeah, it was the second floor, right?

1295
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,420
Oh, it was here?

1296
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,900
No... Oh, no.

1297
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,620
I don't know.

1298
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,720
I feel like there has to be a kitchen on the second floor.

1299
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,120
Yeah, I'm going to the top.

1300
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:07,300
Come on.

1301
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,580
Come on, guys.

1302
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,440
It has to be on the second floor.

1303
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,180
Okay.

1304
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,200
Wait, wait, wait.

1305
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,760
Uh...

1306
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,860
Uh... Don't worry!

1307
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:19,680
Be gone!

1308
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,160
Okay.

1309
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:21,900
Thank you.

1310
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,420
Thank you.

1311
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,220
All right, all right.

1312
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,500
I participated.

1313
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,280
All right.

1314
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:25,600
Come on.

1315
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:25,780
Come on.

1316
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:25,940
Come on.

1317
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:26,840
It has to be...

1318
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,300
Oh, someone said it's on the first floor.

1319
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,500
Someone said it's on the... Thank you.

1320
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,120
Okay, okay, okay.

1321
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,500
Thank you for that one guy that actually played this game.

1322
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,480
The one person that played this game.

1323
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,240
No, not here.

1324
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:40,540
No, no.

1325
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:40,740
Don't tell me.

1326
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,100
How many fucking laundry mats do they have?

1327
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,140
Right?

1328
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,340
Oh, no.

1329
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:46,740
I'm lost.

1330
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,060
Oh, how do I repair this?

1331
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,040
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

1332
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,340
Why would... Okay, let's fucking do like house renovations too, by the way.

1333
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,100
It's like con zombies.

1334
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,460
Yeah.

1335
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,460
Wait, what are you... Oh.

1336
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,820
Wait, but what if we have to go through this later?

1337
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,220
Oh, wait.

1338
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:01,860
She's coming near again.

1339
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,360
Yeah.

1340
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,240
I don't know.

1341
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,780
Well, who cares?

1342
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:05,940
All right.

1343
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,000
Who's going to win first?

1344
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,840
I hope Juna can die like in this game.

1345
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,340
Oh, I thought it was her.

1346
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:17,530
Go away.

1347
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:18,090
Okay.

1348
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:19,310
She's here.

1349
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,190
Go away.

1350
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:20,890
Fuck off.

1351
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,470
Holy shit.

1352
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:24,530
Okay.

1353
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,090
I'm so sick of her.

1354
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,010
She's so ugly.

1355
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,770
Holy shit.

1356
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,090
She's ugly.

1357
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:31,230
Okay.

1358
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:31,910
She's ugly.

1359
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,110
Where the fuck is the...

1360
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:33,790
Are you sure?

1361
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:34,050
Okay.

1362
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,050
Maybe that guy who said it's in the first floor was lying to us.

1363
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,570
No, I'm not lying.

1364
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,110
Because I swear...

1365
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:39,410
I'm not lying.

1366
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:39,810
I swear.

1367
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:39,990
I swear.

1368
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:40,730
What a deceiver.

1369
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:41,330
A liar.

1370
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,030
Where is the kitchen?

1371
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:44,410
Fucking.

1372
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,070
She's in here.

1373
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,650
She's in here.

1374
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:45,810
Brie.

1375
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:46,730
We need you.

1376
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,050
Brie.

1377
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:47,730
Oh my God.

1378
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,210
Brie has to split up from all of us.

1379
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,910
The most important person in our team.

1380
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:53,990
Brie.

1381
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:54,710
All right.

1382
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:55,530
Oh, my God.

1383
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,230
Oh, I can save you.

1384
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:56,810
I can save you.

1385
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:57,790
Okay.

1386
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:58,570
Okay.

1387
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,630
I saved him.

1388
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,310
I saved her.

1389
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:00,790
I saved her.

1390
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:01,290
Okay.

1391
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:01,910
This way.

1392
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,110
We found him.

1393
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:05,290
Oh, no.

1394
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,430
Oh, Brie.

1395
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,120
We got you a surprise!

1396
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,120
It's here?

1397
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:27,920
Where's the kitchen?

1398
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,900
And then here, and then here.

1399
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,460
Oh, they turned off the power again.

1400
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,220
Oh, I found... Oh, hey!

1401
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,800
I got all three!

1402
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,420
I got all three!

1403
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,360
Wait, what?

1404
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,440
What the fuck?

1405
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,240
Don't worry.

1406
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,900
Thank God!

1407
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,460
I got it!

1408
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,360
Go get the electricity!

1409
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:48,940
Alright, alright.

1410
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,340
Huge, huge, huge.

1411
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,440
Alright, we got it.

1412
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,700
We're so lagged.

1413
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,920
We gotta go back.

1414
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:54,980
We gotta go outside!

1415
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:55,500
We gotta go outside!

1416
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,320
I zapped her a million times.

1417
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,160
Oh, shit!

1418
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,400
Guys!

1419
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,220
No!

1420
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,480
Please!

1421
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,780
God would not forsaken me!

1422
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,600
Bro, I'm like hanging by the thread right now.

1423
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,740
I'm hanging by the thread.

1424
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,200
We got it.

1425
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,460
I'm gonna grab the wood.

1426
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,060
I'm gonna grab the wood.

1427
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,580
I got wood.

1428
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,760
Guys, gang!

1429
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,360
We gotta get the wood!

1430
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,300
We're carpenters now!

1431
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,200
We are carpenters!

1432
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,440
We gotta clean up!

1433
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,740
It's okay.

1434
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,140
I got three!

1435
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,140
We need two more, guys!

1436
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:35,920
We need two more!

1437
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,820
Two more?

1438
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,600
Two more wood.

1439
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,200
I was hanging by the bird.

1440
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:39,780
Okay, okay.

1441
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,640
Okay.

1442
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:40,920
Can we just leave?

1443
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,200
Wait, we gotta...

1444
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,900
Place the wood around... I gotta get two more.

1445
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,040
Just be like, sorry, this is just too much.

1446
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,840
This is above our pay grade.

1447
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,800
They're like, bro, aren't you enjoying your bachelor party, bro?

1448
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,480
You won't be able to do this anymore when you get your wife!

1449
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,200
I found another... Oh, nice.

1450
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,860
Okay, we gotta find another ex.

1451
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,760
Where's the other ex?

1452
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,700
Oh, another ex?

1453
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:16,460
Yeah.

1454
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,740
Place the wood around the indicated...

1455
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,080
Yeah, but we already have enough, though.

1456
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,200
We already have enough.

1457
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,340
Oh, whoa!

1458
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,220
Oh, Bri did it!

1459
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,580
Wait for wolves?

1460
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,640
Where the fuck did Bri go?

1461
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,780
Bri!

1462
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,260
Where are you, Bri?

1463
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,640
Oh, there they are!

1464
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:40,760
Oh yeah!

1465
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,560
There's some wolves!

1466
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:42,540
Look!

1467
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,340
There's the wolves!

1468
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,140
What?

1469
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:52,730
What help?

1470
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:53,850
Oh, bitches!

1471
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:56,430
Oh, she gone.

1472
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,150
She's gone.

1473
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,850
We did it, guys!

1474
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,450
We're like, what do you need help?

1475
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:01,950
We're fine.

1476
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:05,570
Like,

1477
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:10,050
what are you talking about?

1478
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,070
We were maxed out stats!

1479
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,350
Now what do we...

1480
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:14,430
We're maxed out.

1481
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:15,970
Is that it?

1482
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:16,690
Did we do it?

1483
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,250
Did we win?

1484
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:17,970
Did we just kill her?

1485
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,150
I guess we just kill her.

1486
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:19,510
Demon's getting closer.

1487
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,510
Demon's getting...

1488
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:21,490
What?!

1489
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:22,130
What?!

1490
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:23,770
Don't worry, I got you.

1491
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:24,170
That looks...

1492
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,310
Oh my god.

1493
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:28,290
I think we did it.

1494
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,710
I think we're supposed to kill her now.

1495
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,630
We're finally not 1 HP.

1496
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,230
Alright.

1497
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,290
Come on, Judah!

1498
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,310
We're maxed out now!

1499
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,370
Come over here and kill us!

1500
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:38,770
Literally!

1501
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,650
We did everything!

1502
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,850
You won't!

1503
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:44,550
You won't!

1504
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:45,830
Come on, Judah!

1505
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,610
We're literally out in the open!

1506
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,110
I shot her every time!

1507
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,090
It's time.

1508
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:56,750
Someone in my chat said that she can't heal anymore, is what we did.

1509
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,010
So she's just like at that HP and she can't go higher.

1510
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,410
Okay.

1511
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,530
Oh, that's right.

1512
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,030
Judah, this is it.

1513
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,990
1v3 us right now.

1514
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:08,450
Come on!

1515
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,570
Get over here!

1516
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,230
I'm gonna have a Mexican stand-off.

1517
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:11,950
1v3!

1518
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,290
I'm like fucking hanging by the thread right now.

1519
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,490
I'm hanging by the thread.

1520
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:17,770
1v3.

1521
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:18,550
I got this!

1522
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:22,350
Judah, if anything, just slap me first.

1523
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:29,070
Judah, just slap me first so I can get revived and have back my HP.

1524
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,050
Judah, that's fucking right!

1525
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:33,730
Be gone!

1526
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:35,730
Shit!

1527
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,350
Okay, she slapped me, guys!

1528
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:39,470
Guys, she slapped me!

1529
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:41,390
Okay, nice.

1530
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:42,130
Thank God.

1531
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:42,430
Alright.

1532
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,390
We did it.

1533
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:44,350
I'm okay.

1534
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:46,170
Oh, wait!

1535
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:46,790
There she is!

1536
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,170
Wait!

1537
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:48,810
Her footsteps!

1538
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:49,710
Wait, where?

1539
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,130
Wait, I can see her footsteps.

1540
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:52,970
Yeah, but it disappeared.

1541
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:53,630
Oh!

1542
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,630
Judah, get down!

1543
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:57,330
You know it's over, Judah!

1544
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:58,650
Back here!

1545
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,470
Judah, it's over!

1546
00:51:59,490 --> 00:51:59,950
Right here!

1547
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:00,270
Right here!

1548
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:00,450
Right here!

1549
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,070
Wait, what?

1550
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,630
I lost her.

1551
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:04,410
Wait, guys!

1552
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,410
Wait, we split up!

1553
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,910
That's not how we're supposed to do this!

1554
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:07,830
Get back here!

1555
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:08,890
Where is she?

1556
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:09,470
Oh!

1557
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:10,330
Yeah!

1558
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,810
Oh my God!

1559
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:16,030
Guys, we got Cressy!

1560
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,190
Cressy!

1561
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,150
Yeah!

1562
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,230
We did it!

1563
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:31,910
Oh shit, wait!

1564
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,130
Just fucking... Hello?

1565
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,490
Huge hello!

1566
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:40,250
I just... I like how it just kicks us out of the game!

1567
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,990
It really kicked... Wait, it kicked you out?

1568
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:44,590
Yeah, it kicked me out!

1569
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:45,710
It kicked me out!

1570
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:46,050
What the hell?

1571
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:46,450
I'm solid!

1572
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:48,070
Oh my God!

1573
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,330
It's the same lobby?

1574
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,050
Yeah, same lobby.

1575
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,030
Okay, okay, okay.

1576
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:52,190
Alright.

1577
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:52,870
You know the name and power.

1578
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:53,210
Okay.

1579
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,430
How was it, Judah, beating the demon?

1580
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,470
Yeah, what is it?

1581
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,630
I was like, bro, like, how do I do the abilities?

1582
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,070
And they're like, oh, you have to press, like, the F1, F2.

1583
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:02,470
And I was like, oh.

1584
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:05,230
But then I realized it was a fucking scroll wheel, like, at the end of the fucking game.

1585
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:10,970
So the reason why I would just, like, stop and stand in front of you guys is because, like, okay, I have to press F6 now.

1586
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:11,430
No!

1587
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:13,890
Oh my God.

1588
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:14,370
Oh my God.

1589
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,150
Bro, why do you... you guys want to die?

1590
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,910
It's because I was killing them.

1591
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,490
I did my job.

1592
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,450
You killed two and then you're still fucking alive!

1593
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,570
You killed two and then you're still fucking alive!

1594
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,330
You're not killing!

1595
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:30,030
What the fuck do you mean?

1596
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:30,450
Nothing!

1597
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,050
Oh my God, I can't believe you guys are inting in my race.

1598
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:34,830
What is it?

1599
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:35,290
What the fuck is it?

1600
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:36,930
Vade retro...

1601
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,150
Yeah, there you go!

1602
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,550
I can't fucking... I can't believe this.

1603
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,790
I can't believe you're inting in my high elo Vade.

1604
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:45,750
I don't know.

1605
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,710
It just sounds like somebody who's just got skill diffed.

1606
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,270
No!

1607
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,490
But it was funny in the beginning.

1608
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:58,430
V was like, oh, I read the instructions, like, she could kill NPCs, but she doesn't know that I was standing in the same room as you guys.

1609
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:58,770
What?

1610
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,570
I can hear you guys.

1611
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,150
God damn it.

1612
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,470
I can't believe you guys are inting in my race.

1613
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,270
What is that?

1614
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:06,850
You couldn't hear us!

1615
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:10,600
The visibility potion works.

1616
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,820
I was standing everywhere.

1617
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,700
You know, because I was at the closet at some point.

1618
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,720
I'm like, I wonder if I have to be quiet.

1619
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,560
I wonder if she can hear me.

1620
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,560
And I heard you just like, I'm in the closet.

1621
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,720
Not the first time though.

1622
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,400
And I was like, oh.

1623
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,260
Oh my God, this puta.

1624
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,940
I can't believe you can actually hear us.

1625
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,460
That just makes it so much better.

1626
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,720
Who's gonna be the demon now?

1627
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,300
Not it.

1628
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,320
Not it.

1629
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,020
Wait, actually.

1630
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:39,660
Not it.

1631
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:40,940
I'll do it.

1632
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,520
All right.

1633
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:41,940
Okay.

1634
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,820
I'll swap roles.

1635
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,800
He wants to be the priest now.

1636
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,020
I tried to kill, like, I tried to like hit the rest of you guys, but Kai just kept like coming in front of me.

1637
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,600
I was like, bitch.

1638
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,900
What are you doing, dude?

1639
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,480
Holy shit.

1640
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,100
Uh huh.

1641
00:54:59,100 --> 00:54:59,580
Uh huh.

1642
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,660
Uh huh.

1643
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,520
Oh my God.

1644
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,460
You want me so bad.

1645
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,140
Like, dude.

1646
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,640
You're like, puta, I'm sick and tired of you.

1647
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,460
I was like, yeah.

1648
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,120
Uh huh.

1649
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,080
Yeah.

1650
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,640
But why do you keep coming back to me?

1651
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,780
Okay, Juna, I hope you actually heal.

1652
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,600
It says you have the ability to heal your teammates quickly.

1653
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,780
Drop healing kits or spawn devices that can increase the life of exorcists.

1654
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,020
Yeah.

1655
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:22,780
Yeah.

1656
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,500
I'm a little silly.

1657
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,060
Wait, wait, wait.

1658
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:29,100
Someone said that in my chat literally immediately as the game ended.

1659
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,280
They're like, no, no, no, breathe.

1660
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:30,640
That's not good.

1661
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,900
The syringe doesn't heal.

1662
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,140
It's just melee damage.

1663
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,380
Like, I didn't know.

1664
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,140
Oh

1665
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,580
my God.

1666
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,980
Wait, Doki, do you want priest or...

1667
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,280
I'll be the engineer.

1668
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:47,640
Okay.

1669
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,160
Now she's engineer.

1670
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,620
What can I do actually?

1671
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,880
Technology is your friend.

1672
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,160
Install cameras, use various sensors and weaken the demon with advanced tool.

1673
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,040
I didn't even know I could do that.

1674
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,720
So advanced tool.

1675
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,160
Okay.

1676
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,840
That's a lot of stuff that somebody not did.

1677
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,920
I don't think I've seen any of these things in that game we play.

1678
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,500
Oh, I don't know.

1679
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,700
Okay.

1680
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,380
I'm muting.

1681
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,400
I started my bad.

1682
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:22,820
Oh, yeah.

1683
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,120
Yeah, muting, muting.

1684
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,100
All right.

1685
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,700
Here we go.

1686
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,040
Oh my God.

1687
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,360
Look at all these tools.

1688
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,620
Oh my God.

1689
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,920
Anti-demonic beam.

1690
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,640
I'm gonna grab...

1691
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,760
I already have this spell.

1692
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,960
There's an electric blower.

1693
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,760
Drive the demon away.

1694
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,800
I got a car.

1695
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,300
What the fuck?

1696
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,500
Oh my God.

1697
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,440
I need 200 XP.

1698
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,300
Magnet.

1699
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,500
Detects useful when the demons become...

1700
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,440
Oh my God.

1701
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,620
I can grab so many items.

1702
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,200
You can grab so many items, guys.

1703
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,240
Just spam grab them.

1704
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,780
Oh my God.

1705
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,120
Oh, you just...

1706
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,980
Oh, okay, okay.

1707
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,760
So, you just grab all of them?

1708
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:10,940
Okay.

1709
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,280
Yeah, you can grab multiple ones.

1710
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,520
Just spam clicking.

1711
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:13,980
Okay.

1712
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,960
I swear to God.

1713
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,860
I swear to God.

1714
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,300
You're gonna grab a heal.

1715
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,840
I did it.

1716
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:21,980
No.

1717
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:22,860
I did it.

1718
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,360
I did it.

1719
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:24,660
I did it.

1720
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,980
There's one job.

1721
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,400
I have seven items.

1722
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,840
I didn't even read what they are.

1723
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,420
I just kept grabbing.

1724
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,140
Yeah.

1725
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,620
I have seven items.

1726
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,060
Oh wait no!

1727
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,800
I have seven items too!

1728
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,260
Yeah, I just kept grabbing!

1729
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,860
Oh so maybe you didn't grab them.

1730
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:41,580
Okay.

1731
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,860
Gamer's don't look up!

1732
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,000
Gamer's don't look up!

1733
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,540
Surveillance camera.

1734
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:45,920
Oh!

1735
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,520
What the hell?

1736
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,660
There you go.

1737
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,300
Yeah, no the monster had the... the monster had push to talk so I just like...

1738
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,620
unpushed to talk myself.

1739
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,660
Alright, let's see.

1740
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,460
Oh wait, really?

1741
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,460
I'm gonna try and put...

1742
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,360
Guys, do you think the demon's gonna go through this?

1743
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,080
Hello!

1744
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,880
Guys, I... I don't... I fucked it up.

1745
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,840
Wait, the demon's already closed though.

1746
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,680
I don't want you telling me I'm ugly when you were looking like you did before.

1747
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,480
Oh my god.

1748
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,100
I don't want you talking to me when you were looking that way.

1749
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:21,140
I couldn't find a fucking NPC and I had to pick an ugly old man.

1750
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,600
You look ugly.

1751
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,400
Wait, I wanna be a...

1752
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:24,580
Holy shit.

1753
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,300
I gotta go to the spa.

1754
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,600
You gotta get your nails...

1755
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,260
I gotta put a...

1756
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,480
I got a cam...

1757
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:29,660
What the fuck?

1758
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,760
Wait, what was that?

1759
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,720
I heard a slam.

1760
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,060
Oh.

1761
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:32,560
What the fuck?

1762
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,340
I got a car.

1763
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:33,620
Look.

1764
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,480
Look at this car.

1765
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,880
Oh my god, that's so funny.

1766
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,420
Guys, I like how nobody's protecting me while I'm in this car.

1767
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,320
Let me just be in this corner.

1768
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,100
Nobody's...

1769
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,360
Wait, I think I got it.

1770
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:50,680
Okay.

1771
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,900
Wait, is that a demon?

1772
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:53,660
Oh, he...

1773
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,440
That watch!

1774
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,840
He just walked in once!

1775
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,260
That's her, guys!

1776
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:58,840
That's her!

1777
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,200
I can't see anything.

1778
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:00,580
Yeah!

1779
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,700
That's her!

1780
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,440
She's just looking at us!

1781
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,680
Be gone!

1782
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:05,720
Yeah!

1783
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,560
Oh my Jesus!

1784
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,500
It's okay, guys.

1785
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,220
I got us.

1786
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:09,500
Where is she?

1787
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,060
Wait, where is she?

1788
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:10,480
She's gone.

1789
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,900
She's gone.

1790
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,760
I got us.

1791
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,620
Wait, where is she?

1792
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,120
Oh, my bad.

1793
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:14,780
I got us.

1794
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,200
I got us.

1795
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,460
My bad.

1796
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,280
Okay, we did a bit of damage.

1797
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,580
My bad.

1798
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:19,940
I got like...

1799
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,060
Just stood there.

1800
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,520
I just...

1801
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,580
Oh, does that heal you guys?

1802
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,820
She was just standing there.

1803
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,200
She's like, I don't know what I'm doing.

1804
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,920
I can't help you.

1805
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,540
Oh, that's a shield.

1806
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,600
Okay, we got a fire...

1807
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:30,740
Whoa!

1808
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:31,420
Lights!

1809
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:31,960
Lights!

1810
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,500
Where the lights are?

1811
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,940
The circuit breakers.

1812
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,160
Okay, okay.

1813
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,560
Where are the circuit breakers?

1814
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,700
Where are the circuit breakers?

1815
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:38,980
Don't worry.

1816
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:39,240
Are you fixing it?

1817
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,300
Found one.

1818
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1819
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,920
The priest is doing it.

1820
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,020
The priest went to electrician school.

1821
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,500
Before he became a priest, he went to trade school.

1822
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,020
And then he found God.

1823
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,180
What did he learn at trade school?

1824
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,980
He found God after.

1825
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:54,760
Found God.

1826
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,280
Yeah.

1827
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:55,980
But...

1828
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,860
I have like cameras.

1829
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,900
But I don't think I'm gonna use them.

1830
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,540
I don't think I'm gonna use the camera.

1831
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,380
Don't worry.

1832
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:02,700
I got it.

1833
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,160
I have no idea what the camera does.

1834
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:04,860
I was trying.

1835
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:05,860
I have no clue.

1836
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:06,560
Don't worry.

1837
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,680
I have movement too.

1838
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,840
I don't even think I picked up half of the stuff.

1839
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:10,720
Oh my God.

1840
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:11,900
Oh my God.

1841
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,620
Demon gets closer.

1842
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,180
Don't worry.

1843
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:13,940
I have a metal detector.

1844
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,200
Like, can I shoot the innocent people?

1845
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,940
Oh my God.

1846
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,400
He's on me.

1847
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:19,700
She's on me.

1848
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,400
Oh my God.

1849
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:20,720
What the...

1850
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,220
Please.

1851
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,260
This is the thing.

1852
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:23,640
Oh my God.

1853
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,120
Oh my God.

1854
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:24,360
Please.

1855
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,540
Why is my priest not doing anything?

1856
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,340
Why?

1857
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,360
Oh, wait.

1858
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:28,880
Wait.

1859
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,680
What?

1860
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,620
I'm trying to fucking leave the camera.

1861
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:31,860
What the fuck?

1862
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,020
I can't figure out how to do it.

1863
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,800
Oh, there she is.

1864
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:34,180
She's right there.

1865
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:34,660
There she is.

1866
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,360
Oh my God.

1867
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:35,980
Get her out.

1868
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,620
Get extra sister out.

1869
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,680
Get out of here.

1870
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,400
Get out.

1871
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,160
Get out.

1872
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,460
Get that shit.

1873
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:47,940
Oh my God.

1874
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:48,580
She's right there.

1875
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,280
What the fuck?

1876
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:50,620
She's...

1877
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,120
I cannot see.

1878
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:51,940
Holy fuck.

1879
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,400
Guys, we have to like...

1880
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,200
I can't see a fucking thing.

1881
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,900
Guys, we have to fucking...

1882
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,620
Grab the electric...

1883
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,340
I think Rhea actually knows how to play this game.

1884
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:01,880
That's crazy.

1885
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:04,740
Wait.

1886
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:06,920
Is that you?

1887
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,460
What is...

1888
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,060
What are you doing?

1889
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,260
Oh, guys.

1890
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:10,780
Guys.

1891
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,100
She actually knows how to play the game, guys.

1892
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:22,070
What is she fucking doing?

1893
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,210
Where is the healer?

1894
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:26,490
Hello.

1895
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:27,750
All I can fucking do is...

1896
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:28,150
Right here.

1897
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,890
Where are you not healing?

1898
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:32,230
Right there.

1899
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,010
You know what?

1900
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:34,450
I'm gonna go get you.

1901
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:35,290
Please.

1902
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,210
I'm fucking...

1903
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,090
Look at my HP.

1904
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,410
I'm barely alive.

1905
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,510
There she is again.

1906
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,810
Maybe try stabbing her with a syringe.

1907
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,430
Bro, I'm fucking free.

1908
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:49,470
Free.

1909
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:50,090
Just free the shit.

1910
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:50,630
Ow.

1911
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:51,470
Oh my God.

1912
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,030
Guys, I'm dead.

1913
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:53,670
There's so much.

1914
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:54,410
Holy shit.

1915
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:55,910
Okay, here.

1916
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:56,130
Here.

1917
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,230
Okay, guys.

1918
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,770
Let's just find the armor door.

1919
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,230
You're gonna heal things, right?

1920
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:03,950
No, it's only... I think you do but you have to pick find it.

1921
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,410
Okay, we gotta like... we gotta go to the basement.

1922
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:09,450
Guys, wait, are you actually healing?

1923
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:11,670
No, no.

1924
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,290
Oh my god.

1925
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:14,250
Okay.

1926
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,670
We gotta find the basement.

1927
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,890
I'm fucking... I'm gonna heal myself.

1928
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,410
I don't need you guys anymore.

1929
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,330
I wanna heal myself.

1930
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,610
I wanna heal myself.

1931
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,190
We just gotta find the bandages.

1932
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,170
We gotta like go to the basement.

1933
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,510
I don't know... what the fuck?

1934
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:31,270
Go away!

1935
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:32,510
Stop touching!

1936
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:39,090
What the fuck are you doing to just touch that beside me?

1937
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,230
We found the basement!

1938
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:40,990
I found the basement!

1939
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:42,310
The basement!

1940
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,570
Oh, please stop!

1941
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:45,930
Oh my god, not again.

1942
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:48,310
Please!

1943
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:49,730
That's too much!

1944
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,170
I can't see anything!

1945
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:56,170
Oh, there she is.

1946
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,610
Don't worry, I'm zapping her!

1947
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:00,270
I'm zapping her!

1948
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:00,710
Be gone!

1949
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:05,290
Oh my god, she fucking crossed.

1950
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:06,490
AHHHH!

1951
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:07,590
Oh shit.

1952
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:10,710
Where's the light breaker?

1953
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:12,170
Where's the light breaker?

1954
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:15,050
Go away, Pring!

1955
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,410
Pring, go away!

1956
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:21,390
Where the fuck is the light breaker?

1957
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:22,070
Where's the light?

1958
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:23,890
Can I open your eyes?

1959
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,370
I don't... I found it!

1960
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:26,810
I found it!

1961
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:29,250
Okay, here we go.

1962
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:30,670
Oh my god.

1963
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:33,350
I found it.

1964
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:34,350
We gotta go downstairs!

1965
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:35,770
I found the light breaker!

1966
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:36,450
Where are you?

1967
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:37,110
Let's go downstairs.

1968
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,570
Okay, this has to be her.

1969
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,490
Can you guys believe this is how much fun we had at the flashbang?

1970
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,770
That's her, by the way.

1971
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:46,830
Hey, thanks, Pring!

1972
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:47,270
Thanks!

1973
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,930
Hey, Pring, thanks for taking us to the basement, Pring!

1974
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,130
We really appreciate it.

1975
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,330
See, she read the tutorial!

1976
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,530
Oh my god, she's got...

1977
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,870
She fucking killed it!

1978
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,150
She was trying to take us to the...

1979
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:01,790
I can hear her!

1980
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:03,970
No way!

1981
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,330
She was trying to take us to the...

1982
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:13,130
She was trying to take us to the thing!

1983
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:13,810
Oh, here it is.

1984
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:14,450
I found it.

1985
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,250
Wait, we don't have the hooking tool.

1986
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:16,690
Who has it?

1987
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:17,310
Oh, shit.

1988
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,630
Okay.

1989
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:18,130
It's your turn.

1990
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:18,670
Go to her.

1991
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,730
I don't even know what it looks like.

1992
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,110
No, she has it.

1993
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,750
She has to do... I don't know how I did it.

1994
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:25,390
Oh, shit.

1995
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:26,370
Don't worry.

1996
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,750
Use your cooldowns, Priest!

1997
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:30,330
What the fuck is this?

1998
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,110
Make sure we don't get...

1999
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:34,410
We don't get... Are you okay?

2000
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:36,110
What?

2001
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:38,210
Okay, give me the hooking tool.

2002
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:40,170
Give me the fucking hooking tool!

2003
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,130
Give me the fucking hooking tool!

2004
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,730
We can't protect you forever!

2005
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:46,530
We can't protect you forever!

2006
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,210
Oh, she did it!

2007
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,410
Oh, it's my turn!

2008
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:49,690
My turn!

2009
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:49,930
Watch!

2010
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:51,570
Nice, nice, nice!

2011
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,710
How did you do this?

2012
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,010
I don't fucking know, shit.

2013
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:56,370
Just blast him?

2014
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:57,430
Okay, I'm gonna keep blasting.

2015
01:04:59,270 --> 01:04:59,670
Pum!

2016
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,710
This would work eventually, right?

2017
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,070
This... Pum!

2018
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:11,090
Oh, I did it!

2019
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:11,570
I did it!

2020
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:12,810
Don't worry!

2021
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:13,910
Just protect me!

2022
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,330
I'll do my job!

2023
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:16,150
Just protect me!

2024
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:18,090
I'm literally 1 HP!

2025
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:21,010
I don't have a lot of cooldowns!

2026
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:23,770
I swear to god!

2027
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,210
Get away!

2028
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:26,990
We're doing our job, Priest!

2029
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:29,570
Okay, I got here.

2030
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,930
Alright, just protect me.

2031
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:35,130
Just protect me while I do my actual job.

2032
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:39,110
Hey.

2033
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:39,670
Heya.

2034
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:41,170
Give me a sec.

2035
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,510
We have a lot of cooldowns here.

2036
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:44,150
Be gone!

2037
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,250
Be gone!

2038
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:48,470
Oh my god.

2039
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:50,150
I can't fucking...

2040
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:51,710
Be gone!

2041
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:55,530
Is this kinky or something?

2042
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:56,270
Ew.

2043
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:58,690
Am I doing it?

2044
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:01,090
How long did it take you?

2045
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,450
No, no, no.

2046
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,290
You're doing it.

2047
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:04,690
How long did it take you?

2048
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:05,830
Oh my god!

2049
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:08,910
We gotta hide!

2050
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:09,550
We gotta hide!

2051
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:12,050
You fucker.

2052
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:12,990
You fucker.

2053
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:15,990
Oh.

2054
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:16,830
Oh.

2055
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,610
There's no way she knows we're here, right?

2056
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,830
There's no way!

2057
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:38,410
Oh.

2058
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,020
Shut the fuck up!

2059
01:06:59,100 --> 01:06:59,740
Guy!

2060
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:02,160
Shut the fuck up!

2061
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,320
She can't hear us!

2062
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,640
Oh my god.

2063
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,520
Bro, she can't hear us!

2064
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:12,740
Why are you fucking...

2065
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,380
Why are you fucking...

2066
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:15,500
Why are you fucking...

2067
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,780
Why are you talking?

2068
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,960
Why is she talking, bro?

2069
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,700
Why is she talking, bro?

2070
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,460
She knew I was in the fucking closet.

2071
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,040
I'm like, girl, I'm not coming out.

2072
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,280
Where is she?

2073
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,340
Where are you?

2074
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,540
Where did you die?

2075
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,940
Why?

2076
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,200
Dude, she literally died.

2077
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:34,860
She died.

2078
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,760
I think she died real.

2079
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,320
She was right in front of the closet.

2080
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,140
Wait, she just died?

2081
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,140
She was right in front of me.

2082
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,220
Really?

2083
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,060
She was like, come here, puta.

2084
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,240
Oh shit!

2085
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,460
Oh shit.

2086
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,900
I'm trying to exorcise this guy.

2087
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,120
Come here, come here, come here.

2088
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,200
Oh no.

2089
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,600
Oh no.

2090
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,120
She's almost dead.

2091
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,100
Okay, okay, okay.

2092
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,160
These spirits are almost dead.

2093
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,660
It's almost dead.

2094
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,940
I'm trying so hard.

2095
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:08,940
I'm blowing him away.

2096
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,080
There we go.

2097
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,120
I did it.

2098
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,060
What the fuck?

2099
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,920
Yeah, we did it.

2100
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:18,400
Okay.

2101
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,760
This is a little awkward that...

2102
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,400
Is she actually dead?

2103
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,160
Dead for real?

2104
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2105
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,280
I think she's...

2106
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,500
You can die for real?

2107
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,000
I thought it was just...

2108
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,840
Yeah, I didn't know.

2109
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,400
I was waiting.

2110
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,300
You can die for real?

2111
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,840
I feel kind of bad, but also, she deserves it, so it's fine.

2112
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,500
Find the key that...

2113
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,520
Oh, wait, these are new quests.

2114
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,200
How do we get out of here?

2115
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,940
I'm okay.

2116
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:51,680
I'm not okay.

2117
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,800
Oh my god!

2118
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,120
You can do that this entire time?

2119
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:58,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2120
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,740
Kai, you have to pick me up.

2121
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,860
Kai, please.

2122
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,740
Kai, we need a key.

2123
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,700
Oh my god, you're right.

2124
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,020
13 seconds to be restored.

2125
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,800
Oh my god.

2126
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,540
There is a limit.

2127
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,040
Keep praying.

2128
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,240
Oh, who the fuck are the bats?

2129
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,980
What the fuck?

2130
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,200
Oh my god.

2131
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,140
Sorry, I got the wrong one.

2132
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:25,740
There were bats.

2133
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,600
There were bats.

2134
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,560
There's so many things going on.

2135
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,480
We gotta leave.

2136
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:32,720
We gotta leave this place.

2137
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,840
This place is bad.

2138
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,560
This place is bad.

2139
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,180
Why the fuck does she get this?

2140
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,480
This map is...

2141
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,140
Why the fuck?

2142
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,260
Why couldn't you do this, Judah?

2143
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,840
Hold on.

2144
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,680
Wait, Bree, hold on.

2145
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,000
Yeah, hold on.

2146
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,060
Okay, now you can pick me up.

2147
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,620
Yeah, hold on.

2148
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,660
Get away.

2149
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,820
Get away.

2150
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,180
Oh, you're nasty.

2151
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,200
Get away.

2152
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,560
Oh, shit!

2153
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,440
Guys, you have to keep me up.

2154
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,620
No!

2155
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,200
What the fuck?

2156
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,070
Holy shit.

2157
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,830
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

2158
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,070
What the fuck?

2159
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:24,570
I'm sorry, Judah.

2160
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,270
I read the tutorial!

2161
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:28,290
You're so good at this game!

2162
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:30,490
I think she's gonna get the tutorial!

2163
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:31,970
She actually cracked.

2164
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:32,770
I read the tutorial!

2165
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:37,830
Judah, why the fuck were you talking to me?

2166
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:40,950
If you wait, it'll like give you...

2167
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,070
It'll just stay in the lobby.

2168
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,030
Okay, I'll be the demon.

2169
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:44,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2170
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,890
You'll be the demon.

2171
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,470
I'll be the demon.

2172
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:51,030
I have one target.

2173
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:54,470
It's free, right?

2174
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:57,310
It's free, right?

2175
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:57,450
It's free, right?

2176
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,010
Free, free, what are you gonna pick free?

2177
01:10:59,070 --> 01:10:59,690
I'm curious.

2178
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,980
I'll go back to my medic.

2179
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,480
It's okay.

2180
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,940
I know what to do now.

2181
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,920
Wait, wait, Kai, weren't you the priest last time?

2182
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:14,900
Yeah, I was.

2183
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:15,460
Yes.

2184
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,680
You don't wanna be priest?

2185
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:18,900
You're the priest!

2186
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,840
Are you ready?

2187
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:23,420
Yeah.

2188
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:24,620
Alright, you.

2189
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,780
Bye, goodbye.

2190
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,000
GG's, good luck.

2191
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,060
Alright, I'm in.

2192
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,700
Oh, I have to possess an em- Oh, am I on a farm?

2193
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,820
Wait, is this the same?

2194
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,380
Is this the mansion again?

2195
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,200
Why the fuck did they get the mansion?

2196
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,980
Wait, no, this is a farmhouse.

2197
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,560
Wait, is this a different?

2198
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,900
No, this is...

2199
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:46,020
Different?

2200
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:46,420
Same?

2201
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,300
I can't tell!

2202
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,690
Oh, I'm gonna be you.

2203
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:53,150
I'm gonna be you.

2204
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,070
I'm gonna be a nice old lady.

2205
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:57,730
That's fucking right.

2206
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:59,870
Now what do I do?

2207
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,290
Ha ha ha!

2208
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,010
If I keep walking, they won't know.

2209
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:07,790
They won't know.

2210
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:08,950
They won't know.

2211
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,510
They're gonna start off inside.

2212
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:12,870
They're gonna start off inside.

2213
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,190
Oh my god, no, this is different.

2214
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,570
I've never seen this place before.

2215
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:17,350
Okay.

2216
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:19,990
I didn't read the tutorial, so...

2217
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,470
Good luck to me!

2218
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:28,290
How do I get to the entrance?

2219
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:33,650
Oh my god, I'm lost!

2220
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,990
Wait, where am I?

2221
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,790
Bob, regain life with demonic.

2222
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,370
I'm turning the bell.

2223
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:47,730
Oh.

2224
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:54,010
I hear them.

2225
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:58,490
There's a bitch in there.

2226
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:00,630
Yeah, I saw her running.

2227
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:02,630
What the fuck?

2228
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:03,810
Sorry.

2229
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:07,890
Get your ass over here, bitch.

2230
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,230
And they have...

2231
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:12,610
Sorry,

2232
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:16,220
bro.

2233
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,780
He just walks off.

2234
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,900
Like, why do they stay here if they know it's possessed?

2235
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:21,500
I know, right?

2236
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,700
They have nowhere else to live.

2237
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,100
They have nowhere else to live.

2238
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,740
Oh shit.

2239
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,000
That was frightening.

2240
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,900
Is that her?

2241
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:33,730
She went upstairs.

2242
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:37,370
Yeah.

2243
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:41,070
Hello?

2244
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:44,570
What the fuck?

2245
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:46,930
I don't know.

2246
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:48,570
She went upstairs.

2247
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:50,190
Okay, okay.

2248
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:52,450
Shut up!

2249
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:54,410
Over.

2250
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,090
Fuck!

2251
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:06,950
What the fuck?

2252
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:07,050
What the fuck?

2253
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:07,770
How did you get in there?

2254
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,690
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2255
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,170
Why can't we be friends?

2256
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,150
Why can't we be friends?

2257
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:13,950
It'll be alright.

2258
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,850
What the fuck are you doing?

2259
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:21,780
Wait, what the...

2260
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:22,560
Oh, fuck.

2261
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,200
Lightbox, lightbox, lightbox.

2262
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2263
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,360
I did it, I did it, I did it.

2264
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,600
Why can't we be friends?

2265
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,560
Why can't we be friends?

2266
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,680
Why can't we be friends?

2267
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,160
Why can't we be friends?

2268
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,940
Why can't we be friends?

2269
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:42,800
Why can't we be friends?

2270
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,320
Why can't we be friends?

2271
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,320
Oh shit, no!

2272
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,800
My door!

2273
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,040
Don't worry, I can crawl!

2274
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,440
You can't fucking hit me!

2275
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:56,940
Don't hit me!

2276
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,640
That's a great...

2277
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,540
You can't fucking get me!

2278
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,940
I'm crawling away!

2279
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:03,980
I can't see!

2280
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:05,940
Oh my god!

2281
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:09,800
What the hell?

2282
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:10,460
What the fuck?

2283
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,700
What did you do?

2284
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:12,140
Ow!

2285
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,320
Get off my fucking back!

2286
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,880
What did you say about me not being a good monster?

2287
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:20,600
What did you say about me not being a good monster?

2288
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,200
Do you think it's fucking...

2289
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,200
That's fucking right.

2290
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,500
That's fucking right.

2291
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,300
Give me like three seconds.

2292
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,140
Give me three seconds!

2293
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:29,140
No!

2294
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,000
Shit!

2295
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,460
Give me three seconds so I can do this.

2296
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,580
No, no, no!

2297
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:35,600
No fucking way!

2298
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,200
It's okay, we're fine.

2299
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,860
You think if I stay, don't keep her in the mirror three times, she'll appear behind me?

2300
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,020
Hey!

2301
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,660
What the fuck?

2302
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:53,150
Bro, what the fuck?

2303
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:54,630
Get away from me!

2304
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,630
Get away from me!

2305
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:00,970
Get away from me!

2306
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,710
What the fuck was that?

2307
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,010
Where are the altars?

2308
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:12,170
How the fuck am I gonna be healed?

2309
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:15,710
Oh my god, guys, I'm pretty fucked up right now.

2310
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:16,530
What?

2311
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:18,370
Get away!

2312
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:19,470
Oh, I missed.

2313
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:20,670
Guys, I missed.

2314
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:21,850
Don't worry.

2315
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:22,650
Get away!

2316
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:24,810
Oh my god, cringe?

2317
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:25,430
Don't worry.

2318
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:26,290
Don't worry.

2319
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,270
There you go.

2320
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,230
That's fucking right.

2321
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:30,950
That's fucking right.

2322
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:30,950
That's fucking right.

2323
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,110
Get away from me!

2324
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:34,450
Get away from me!

2325
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,870
I need a cooldown!

2326
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:40,670
Okay.

2327
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:44,190
Okay.

2328
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:46,250
That's right.

2329
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:47,510
You don't know what to do.

2330
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,010
That's fucking right.

2331
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:53,270
That's a- I have the high ground now!

2332
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:54,890
Wait, Kai, you're almost dead.

2333
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:58,450
I think Kai's dying.

2334
01:16:58,690 --> 01:16:59,870
I think Kai's almost dead.

2335
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:01,190
Kai!

2336
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:03,470
Hey!

2337
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:05,150
Kai!

2338
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:07,010
No!

2339
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:08,710
That's fine.

2340
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:09,090
I got him.

2341
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:10,930
That's fucking right!

2342
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:11,390
Oh!

2343
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:12,510
Yes!

2344
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:12,910
Oh,

2345
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:16,920
come here.

2346
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,220
Goodbye.

2347
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:21,930
Where did I go?

2348
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,550
That's the wrong person.

2349
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:32,230
That's fucking right!

2350
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:32,510
Oh my god!

2351
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:33,490
That's fucking right!

2352
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,130
What do you do about that?

2353
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:36,650
Nothing!

2354
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:38,350
Nothing!

2355
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,060
No, I'm not.

2356
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,220
No, I'm not.

2357
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:52,760
No, I'm not!

2358
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:53,500
Oh my god.

2359
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,160
No, I'm not!

2360
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,100
No, I'm not!

2361
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:58,300
You don't know where I am!

2362
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,480
Get out of here!

2363
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,000
Down!

2364
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,820
He feels low!

2365
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,280
He feels low!

2366
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:08,630
Wait, guys.

2367
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:09,550
I don't know how to get down.

2368
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:13,310
Get out of here!

2369
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,510
Get away!

2370
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:17,330
Get away from me!

2371
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,190
Leave me alone!

2372
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:24,390
Leave me alone!

2373
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:25,570
I'm just an old lady!

2374
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:29,910
I'm just an old lady!

2375
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:30,410
I'm just an old lady!

2376
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:31,050
Leave me alone!

2377
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,870
That's so fucked up!

2378
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,050
That's so fucked up!

2379
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:41,730
That's so fucked up!

2380
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,450
That's so fucked up!

2381
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:42,810
That's so fucked up!

2382
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:43,690
Oh no, we gotta find...

2383
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:44,710
We gotta light the hall first.

2384
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:47,830
Okay, here you go.

2385
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:50,390
Okay, here you go.

2386
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:51,130
There you go.

2387
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:53,190
This is so fucked up, guys.

2388
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,030
Oh, she's healing!

2389
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:55,670
What the fuck?

2390
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:57,310
Her ass cracked?

2391
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:00,290
Oh my god!

2392
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:01,170
Bro, fuck you!

2393
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:02,410
I hate it!

2394
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,570
Oh shit!

2395
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:05,550
Fuck you!

2396
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,730
Fuck you guys!

2397
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:10,450
That's fucking right.

2398
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:11,930
Oh shit, my bad!

2399
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,370
Well, I no longer have to...

2400
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:19,130
That's right, you guys deserve that!

2401
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,510
Oh my god!

2402
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:22,150
That's fucking right!

2403
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,230
That's fucking right!

2404
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:26,590
That's fucking right!

2405
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:30,550
Fuck you!

2406
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:31,570
No!

2407
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:33,590
That dude just...

2408
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:35,090
There you go.

2409
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:36,930
Okay.

2410
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,250
We need a health item.

2411
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:41,530
Medic, where's your medic?

2412
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,230
Goodbye, sis.

2413
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:44,190
I'm already...

2414
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,210
I'm already...

2415
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:50,470
Where the fuck is the heal?

2416
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:53,990
How many times I have to teach you a lesson?

2417
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,030
How many times I have to teach you a lesson?

2418
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:57,230
That's so fucked up that you guys won't...

2419
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,570
It's so fucked up you guys will bully the elderly.

2420
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,270
It's so fucked up.

2421
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,010
That's so fucked up, guys.

2422
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:06,390
You guys are trying to kill us!

2423
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,210
Oh my god!

2424
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:10,610
Old people built this city!

2425
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,630
That's so fucked up!

2426
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:16,310
That's so fucked up!

2427
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:17,350
They smell weird.

2428
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:18,250
They're so gross.

2429
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:19,830
Sometimes they try to kill us.

2430
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:20,070
Wow!

2431
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:23,250
That's fucked up.

2432
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:24,750
Oh, we're fucked.

2433
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:25,990
That's fucked up, guys.

2434
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:29,550
I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning!

2435
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:29,910
I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning!

2436
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,570
That's fucking right!

2437
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:38,010
Yes!

2438
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:38,530
Yes!

2439
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:39,150
No!

2440
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,090
Get away!

2441
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:43,750
Get over.

2442
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:44,830
I got you, I got you.

2443
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:45,510
No, you don't.

2444
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:46,030
No, you don't.

2445
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:46,530
No, you don't.

2446
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:47,290
No, you don't.

2447
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:47,770
No, you don't.

2448
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:48,990
No, you don't.

2449
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:50,270
No, you don't.

2450
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:52,310
No, you don't.

2451
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,230
No, you don't.

2452
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,390
That's fucked up!

2453
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:03,390
You're capping the heals.

2454
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:06,030
I can't heal because you're literally capping.

2455
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:09,110
You're literally capping heals.

2456
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,770
Get out of the way.

2457
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:18,910
I'm so f***ed up!

2458
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:21,430
How am I supposed to hear?!

2459
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:32,330
Bro, get off the f***ing heels!

2460
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:47,650
Yeah.

2461
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:48,990
That's f***ing...

2462
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:56,650
That's f***ing right I am!

2463
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:57,270
Let me in!

2464
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,750
YES!

2465
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,030
That's f***ing right!

2466
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:06,030
I'mma camp you!

2467
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:08,010
Nooo!

2468
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:09,070
Nooo!

2469
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:10,270
Don't do this!

2470
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:11,150
Nooo!

2471
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:12,270
Don't do this!

2472
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:13,690
This is so gross!

2473
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:17,610
Nobody will save your life now!

2474
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:20,950
No!

2475
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,070
That's f***ing right!

2476
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:27,490
That's f***ing right!

2477
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:30,390
No one can save you now!

2478
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:34,150
That's f***ing right.

2479
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:36,070
You die now.

2480
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:39,130
Oh, you wanna crawl back?

2481
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,630
That's right.

2482
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,770
You wanna try crawling back?

2483
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:45,690
I'm coming, Kai!

2484
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:46,190
Don't worry!

2485
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:46,610
I'm coming!

2486
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:48,450
No!

2487
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:51,960
Nobody's gonna save you!

2488
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:53,250
I'm gonna try to get out of this house!

2489
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:53,470
I'm coming!

2490
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,250
No one...

2491
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:00,950
Every time you pick me up, it resets my counter and so we're just gonna be here for a while.

2492
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:01,630
Okay, don't worry.

2493
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:02,070
I can wait.

2494
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:05,610
Oh, dang it.

2495
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:05,990
Thanks.

2496
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,390
We can wait here.

2497
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:08,310
Don't worry.

2498
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:11,470
Weeeee!

2499
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:11,970
Weeeee!

2500
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:15,900
Yuna!

2501
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:15,960
Yuna!

2502
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,080
Heeeeey!

2503
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,160
Help!

2504
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,100
Help!

2505
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,540
And there she goes!

2506
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:28,980
She's gone!

2507
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,140
She's gone forever!

2508
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:37,860
I'm so glad you're not laughing!

2509
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,480
Bree's never coming back, guys!

2510
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,120
She's never coming back!

2511
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:52,180
She's never coming back!

2512
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,820
Holy shit, your feet are looking rough!

2513
01:23:59,020 --> 01:23:59,620
Holy shit!

2514
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,340
Dude, your toes!

2515
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,400
Yum yum!

2516
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,720
Yum yum!

2517
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:06,420
She's not coming back for you!

2518
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,140
Yum yum yum!

2519
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,380
She hit your nails done!

2520
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:11,440
I think red would look really good on your toenails.

2521
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:22,880
I figured out the game!

2522
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,760
Where are you?

2523
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,400
Oh, I should heal.

2524
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:30,660
Actually.

2525
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,220
What the fuck?

2526
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,540
There's nothing here!

2527
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:35,900
Oh, it's right here.

2528
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:36,860
Alright.

2529
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:37,680
Yuna!

2530
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,940
Yuna, say something, Yuna!

2531
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:40,980
You're the last one!

2532
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,160
Yuna!

2533
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,160
Yuna!

2534
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:46,860
Yuna!

2535
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,340
Oh my god, there's so many!

2536
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,780
Open a portal?

2537
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,440
Wait, what's this?

2538
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,900
Turn invisible?

2539
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:55,440
Let's do it.

2540
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,040
Oh, Yuna!

2541
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,200
Yuna!

2542
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,080
You're gonna do the silence?

2543
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,760
The silent run?

2544
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,620
Oh, no, she's downstairs.

2545
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,340
I hear you, Yuna!

2546
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,860
I hear you!

2547
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,320
You're somewhere around.

2548
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,060
Oh, Yuna!

2549
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:18,660
Come on, Yuna!

2550
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:19,340
Say something!

2551
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,160
Yuna, keep talking!

2552
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,960
I'm trying to find you!

2553
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,220
Oh, full heal.

2554
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:31,940
I'm gonna full heal.

2555
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:37,670
She has to be here somewhere.

2556
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,770
Where the fuck did she go?

2557
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,110
What the fuck?

2558
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,370
Where is she?

2559
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:54,170
Oh my god, she's just trying to one-man clutch this.

2560
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:58,430
I'll keep healing until I'm full HP.

2561
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:00,190
Until I find her.

2562
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:04,630
Check every closet?

2563
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:05,290
Oh, you're right.

2564
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:07,090
Let's check every closet.

2565
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:10,830
No closet for you.

2566
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:12,710
How do you...

2567
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:14,150
What

2568
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:18,150
the fuck?

2569
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:18,750
Where am I?

2570
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:22,510
Hello?

2571
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:23,190
Hello?

2572
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:23,810
Hello?

2573
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:25,470
Get

2574
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,160
over here!

2575
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,420
Get over here!

2576
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,880
Respect your elders!

2577
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,000
Listen, listen, listen.

2578
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,480
Respect your elders!

2579
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,580
I'm outside now.

2580
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,500
I'm coming for you.

2581
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,020
Oh shit, that's...

2582
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:44,160
I can't leave...

2583
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,620
the fucking... fucking...

2584
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,820
Bannister blocked me.

2585
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:50,620
Juna?

2586
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,300
Where did you go?

2587
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,400
Juna?

2588
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,520
Juna, you fucking...

2589
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,920
You gotta die eventually!

2590
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,100
Your friends are all dead!

2591
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,420
All your friends are dead!

2592
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,440
Get over here!

2593
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,320
I hear you!

2594
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:09,300
Get over here!

2595
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,900
All your friends are literally...

2596
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,280
Are you in here?

2597
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:14,940
Are you in here?

2598
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,640
Are you in here?

2599
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:16,960
Juna?

2600
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:17,180
Get over here!

2601
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:17,940
Get over here!

2602
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:18,020
Get over here!

2603
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:18,220
Juna?

2604
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:18,940
Juna, you're still alive!

2605
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,180
That's fucking right!

2606
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,420
I'm coming for you!

2607
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,660
No, you can't!

2608
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,360
That's fucking right!

2609
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:25,240
Get batted!

2610
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,080
Yeah!

2611
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,300
Outside for like 10 minutes.

2612
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:39,560
You tubing by yourself in the corner with your little camera?

2613
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,720
You're like, how are you sitting inside?

2614
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,940
How are you sitting outside?

2615
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,820
I let you die!

2616
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,900
You let Kai die!

2617
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,020
Kai left me to die!

2618
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,200
Kai left me to die!

2619
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,280
So it was only fair, please understand.

2620
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:56,740
I did it for the end game!

2621
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,740
You did it for your own selfish gains!

2622
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,160
But you still died!

2623
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:05,380
You ran out the building and never came back!

2624
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,860
I just look up and I see you two on the fucking roof!

2625
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:12,940
I'm like, what is going on?!

2626
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:20,860
The fact that you let me kidnap Bri up on the roof and you guys couldn't do anything about it.

2627
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:23,280
I was watching you were playing with her body!

2628
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:28,820
I fell off the other side of the roof and you guys weren't there to- I was on the ground!

2629
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:35,180
She's just taking pictures, she got the camera.

2630
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,820
You guys saved her!

2631
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,080
She literally fell off the roof and you just let her die!

2632
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:42,780
No, but I thought she was dead already!

2633
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:48,200
Every time you fall off the roof, it resets it!

2634
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,620
So you get 30 seconds every time!

2635
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:55,600
I was playing with my food and you still didn't save her!

2636
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:56,740
That's so fucked up!

2637
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,440
Ash messed up, yo!

2638
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,120
It's okay.

2639
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,520
Oh my god.

2640
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,480
I'm honestly so surprised we lasted so long that first game now.

2641
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:07,700
We're getting through these so quick!

2642
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,960
What the fuck was going on?!

2643
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:10,980
Yeah!

2644
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,660
Oh shit!

2645
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:12,920
I'm so sorry!

2646
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,240
The first 20 minutes I was like, how do I attack?

2647
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,740
Because I could just only crawl.

2648
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:17,820
Oh yeah!

2649
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,620
I was just crawling around!

2650
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:22,180
I was like, where's Juno?

2651
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:23,140
I was so confused.

2652
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:23,920
It's okay.

2653
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:29,960
Juno, you purposely let us go through all the objectives to see what it was like, right?

2654
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2655
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,180
Of course, of course.

2656
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:33,320
Trust.

2657
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,220
That's so generous.

2658
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:38,040
I can't believe you guys bullied the elderly though.

2659
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:38,980
That's so fucked up.

2660
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,480
That elderly killed me.

2661
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,600
The elderly dragged it to the break.

2662
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,680
And then they're in front of me.

2663
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,640
I only did that because you three ganged up on this sweet, old lady.

2664
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:54,460
You guys surrounded me, it was self-defense.

2665
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:55,360
Oh.

2666
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:55,760
Okay.

2667
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:02,500
Guys, the only one who hasn't played the demon.

2668
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,440
Yeah.

2669
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,260
Holy shit.

2670
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:06,360
I'm scared!

2671
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,020
I don't know why I'm scared.

2672
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:08,780
I'm the demon!

2673
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,800
We got this.

2674
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,240
This will be fun.

2675
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:14,860
This will be fun.

2676
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:15,840
I'm just ready.

2677
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:16,900
I'm gonna mute now.

2678
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,500
Goodbye!

2679
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,060
Goodbye forever!

2680
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:22,620
Okay.

2681
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:23,640
Anyway.

2682
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:24,920
Kill machine!

2683
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,000
Okay, I'm grabbing everything.

2684
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,120
There's like med kits!

2685
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,480
Why did you not grab the med kit?!

2686
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,360
There's literally first aid!

2687
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,440
Okay.

2688
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:52,780
I'm grabbing med kit.

2689
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:54,620
Yeah!

2690
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:55,720
There's a dog clicker!

2691
01:30:59,130 --> 01:30:59,610
Okay.

2692
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:04,210
I don't think so.

2693
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:05,590
These are only reserved for me.

2694
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:06,910
You can?

2695
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:09,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2696
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:09,810
I picked it up!

2697
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:12,390
Oh, maybe it was like XP!

2698
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:13,590
I have the XP!

2699
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:16,470
When I was at med... Oh, what the fuck?

2700
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:18,250
Because I think we got more XP now.

2701
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:22,370
Because I played survivor, I can probably pick it up now too if I played the mimic.

2702
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:24,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2703
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:25,390
Don't worry.

2704
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:27,310
I have the med kit.

2705
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:28,470
I can actually heal.

2706
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:30,230
I can heal now.

2707
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:31,590
You can actually do your med kit.

2708
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:34,090
You finally got the proper license.

2709
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:36,090
I have the license to heal.

2710
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:37,530
Let me see.

2711
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,310
What do my things do?

2712
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:40,770
This has to be the demon.

2713
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:41,130
The demon, right?

2714
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:43,470
Who's this guy?

2715
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:45,050
Oh, look at your dog!

2716
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:46,230
Look at your dog!

2717
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:46,930
Look at my doggie!

2718
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:47,930
Where is he?

2719
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:48,650
Where is she?

2720
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:49,730
Come here, come here.

2721
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:50,610
There's a doggie!

2722
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:51,310
Oh my god!

2723
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,390
What is that?

2724
01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:00,890
That's so cute!

2725
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:01,890
Okay, he's patrolling.

2726
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:03,570
He's doing his job.

2727
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:04,990
Yeah, he's doing his job.

2728
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:06,210
Alright, we gotta find me.

2729
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:07,950
Wait, we got...

2730
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:08,490
Why are you...

2731
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:10,950
Oh, that was... Oh, no, that's an enchantment.

2732
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:14,050
That means she was near because she enchanted.

2733
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:14,430
Yeah.

2734
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:16,750
Okay, so we gotta...

2735
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:18,590
We gotta find Candace.

2736
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:19,250
The demon gets closer.

2737
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:20,530
Oh, really?

2738
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:22,050
Wait, I heard her.

2739
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:22,650
Wait, I hear...

2740
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:23,670
Wait, wait, wait, I hear her.

2741
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:24,330
I hear her.

2742
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:24,770
I hear...

2743
01:32:24,770 --> 01:32:25,550
We hear you, Kai!

2744
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:27,270
Kai, speak!

2745
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:28,230
Oh, right here.

2746
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:29,070
Oh, right here.

2747
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:30,390
Right here.

2748
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:31,930
That's fucking right!

2749
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:32,510
Get away!

2750
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:34,450
Get away!

2751
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:35,110
Get away!

2752
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:35,470
Yeah!

2753
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:36,850
Get away!

2754
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:37,910
Leave!

2755
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:38,330
Oh, wait!

2756
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:39,330
Oh, mama!

2757
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:42,290
Holy shit!

2758
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:42,590
Yeah!

2759
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:44,030
Holy shit!

2760
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:44,830
That's fucking right!

2761
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:45,550
Stun locker!

2762
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:46,250
Stun locker!

2763
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:47,150
That's good, Adalyn!

2764
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:48,390
Yeah!

2765
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:49,910
Oh, I kicked her out.

2766
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:54,110
That's fucking right!

2767
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:55,170
Believe her!

2768
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:55,450
Oh, is she here?

2769
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:56,830
No, she got...

2770
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:58,450
She, like, teleported away.

2771
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:00,230
Like, when you hit her too much.

2772
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:02,870
Wait, we gotta find the candle.

2773
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:03,810
Oh, my God!

2774
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:07,270
Wait, the dog sits on this, like, this portal on the ground.

2775
01:33:07,610 --> 01:33:07,950
Oh!

2776
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:10,510
There's just, like, this giant red portal that's blowing.

2777
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:11,130
It's upstairs.

2778
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:12,350
Wait, where's...

2779
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:13,110
Where's Judah?

2780
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:13,770
I'm trying to...

2781
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:14,010
I'm trying to...

2782
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:15,050
Judah, where are you doing?

2783
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:18,410
What are you doing out here?

2784
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:19,390
I was following her!

2785
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,050
Get back inside!

2786
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:21,450
We gotta do our mission!

2787
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:24,150
I can climb walls!

2788
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,630
Get inside before she drags you to the roof!

2789
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:32,110
Get inside!

2790
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:33,910
She can climb down!

2791
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:34,450
Oh!

2792
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:37,210
Bro, what the fuck?

2793
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:38,770
Why did you...

2794
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:39,930
I thought that was...

2795
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:41,650
I just wanted to see if I could.

2796
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:43,310
The possibility was there.

2797
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:43,910
Okay, okay, okay.

2798
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:43,990
I'm sorry.

2799
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:44,170
I'm sorry.

2800
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:44,650
Oh, my God.

2801
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:45,170
Let's...

2802
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:46,730
Oh, my gosh.

2803
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:47,390
Oh, my gosh.

2804
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:48,190
She's just a hospital.

2805
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:48,730
Die.

2806
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:48,770
Die.

2807
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:49,630
We gotta find the candle.

2808
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:51,210
Wait.

2809
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:51,570
Oh!

2810
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:52,010
Wait!

2811
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:53,130
She was behind us!

2812
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:54,330
Don't worry!

2813
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:55,490
I have the med kit!

2814
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:56,250
Here!

2815
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:58,430
I dropped it.

2816
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:58,870
Take it.

2817
01:33:59,010 --> 01:33:59,530
Thank you!

2818
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:01,490
Yeah, we can heal now.

2819
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:02,670
We can heal.

2820
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:02,910
Oh!

2821
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:03,650
Oh, shit.

2822
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:04,350
Don't worry.

2823
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,190
I have night vision.

2824
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:07,510
I took my night vision pill.

2825
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:08,570
Oh, I have a...

2826
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:08,990
I have a...

2827
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:09,370
Oh, shit.

2828
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:09,990
Alright.

2829
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:15,650
Oh, shit.

2830
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:16,050
Okay.

2831
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:17,170
Get away!

2832
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,410
I have a gun!

2833
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:19,170
I missed.

2834
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:20,210
Uh...

2835
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:20,670
This one.

2836
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:21,790
No.

2837
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:22,430
Get away!

2838
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:23,570
That's what I want.

2839
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:24,070
Okay.

2840
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:25,270
Come over here now!

2841
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:25,790
Let me shoot you!

2842
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:26,950
Let me shoot you!

2843
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:27,770
We need...

2844
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:28,050
We need...

2845
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:28,390
Oh!

2846
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:29,350
Oh!

2847
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:29,830
She's invincible!

2848
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:30,470
She's invincible!

2849
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:32,410
Oh, that's not good!

2850
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:33,650
That's not good!

2851
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:34,070
Leave!

2852
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:34,350
Leave!

2853
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:34,650
Leave!

2854
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:35,770
Leave!

2855
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:36,190
Leave!

2856
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,590
Leave!

2857
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:37,830
Leave!

2858
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:38,070
Leave!

2859
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:44,310
We're sorry!

2860
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:44,590
No!

2861
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:46,070
We're sorry!

2862
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:48,390
It wasn't a joke!

2863
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:49,430
It wasn't a joke!

2864
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:50,390
It wasn't a joke!

2865
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:51,810
We love the elderly!

2866
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:54,310
We love the elderly!

2867
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:57,410
We love the elderly so much!

2868
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:58,070
No!

2869
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:01,150
No!

2870
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:01,870
No!

2871
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:02,770
Please!

2872
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:03,310
Wait, is it true?

2873
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:04,250
Do you really love the elderly?

2874
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:05,210
Yes, it was true.

2875
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,030
I would never lie about that.

2876
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:07,770
You know that.

2877
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:09,330
I always...

2878
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:10,130
No, please!

2879
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:11,410
It wasn't a joke!

2880
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:12,330
That was a joke!

2881
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,410
It wasn't a joke!

2882
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:15,450
Because I love the...

2883
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,330
But I'm scared!

2884
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:17,190
I'm scared!

2885
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:20,690
I was so scared!

2886
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:22,230
Guys!

2887
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:23,090
Please!

2888
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:23,990
Please!

2889
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:25,150
I'm so scared!

2890
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:30,050
Oh, she's okay!

2891
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:30,570
She...

2892
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:31,630
Oh, she's fine!

2893
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:32,370
It's fine!

2894
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:32,770
It's fine!

2895
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:33,810
Okay.

2896
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,210
Guys, we...

2897
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:36,370
We're okay.

2898
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:37,870
We're okay now.

2899
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:39,310
We're okay.

2900
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:39,770
We're fine!

2901
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:40,510
We're fine!

2902
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:41,210
We're fine!

2903
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:43,690
We need to find a candle!

2904
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:47,150
We haven't found anything yet.

2905
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:47,530
Oh my God!

2906
01:35:47,530 --> 01:35:47,850
We haven't...

2907
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,450
I'm healing myself.

2908
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:54,890
I realize the first aid kit only gives you a plus 7.5.

2909
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:56,310
Oh.

2910
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:58,850
This is not good.

2911
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:04,790
Oh my God!

2912
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:06,670
Guys!

2913
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:08,130
Oh!

2914
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:08,990
Get away!

2915
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:10,250
Oh my God!

2916
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:10,650
Oh!

2917
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:11,370
Get away!

2918
01:36:11,810 --> 01:36:12,450
Get her away!

2919
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:15,690
Oh my God.

2920
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:17,050
Guys, I'm not okay.

2921
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:19,330
I'm not...

2922
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:21,050
Sorry.

2923
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:28,570
What the fuck?

2924
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:29,470
It's okay.

2925
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,930
Guys, we have to do something!

2926
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:33,650
We've done nothing, guys!

2927
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:38,610
We haven't found a single candle!

2928
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:39,750
I got too much!

2929
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,550
I got too much!

2930
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:40,750
I got too much!

2931
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:42,590
We haven't found anything!

2932
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:43,890
Do you know where the stuff are?

2933
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:45,910
Wait, where's Bri?

2934
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:46,850
Where's Bri?

2935
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:47,050
Bri!

2936
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:48,190
Oh shit!

2937
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:49,150
Yeah!

2938
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:52,410
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, take a picture.

2939
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:53,670
Oh, you look so cute!

2940
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:54,690
Yeah, look at that!

2941
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:55,610
It's so cute!

2942
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:57,150
Wait, let's take a group photo!

2943
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,510
Can we take a group photo?

2944
01:36:58,510 --> 01:37:00,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2945
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:01,150
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2946
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:02,230
Okay, I'll crouch down.

2947
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:03,090
I'm really tall.

2948
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:03,670
I'll crouch down.

2949
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:03,910
Okay.

2950
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:04,490
You are really tall.

2951
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:05,230
Okay, hold on.

2952
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:06,650
We gotta wait for the cooldown.

2953
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:08,330
Alright, here you go.

2954
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:08,870
Okay.

2955
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:10,150
Wait, wait.

2956
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:11,030
What does this do?

2957
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:12,650
Cheese!

2958
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,110
Cheese!

2959
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:16,130
Cheese!

2960
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:16,950
Hallelujah!

2961
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:21,790
That's so fucked up!

2962
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:24,730
Wait, why do I keep getting these cutscenes?

2963
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:26,650
That's so fucked up.

2964
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,450
That is so fucked up!

2965
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:29,370
I'm literally killing you.

2966
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:31,310
That's so fucked up!

2967
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:31,830
I'm literally killing you.

2968
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:32,430
I'm literally dead right now.

2969
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:33,150
Get her away!

2970
01:37:33,730 --> 01:37:35,650
I'm literally gonna hit the Woody right now.

2971
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:35,830
Picture!

2972
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:37,270
Oh my god.

2973
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:38,730
Guys!

2974
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:44,330
You can't kill us if we keep pressing each other!

2975
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:45,350
You can't kill us if we keep pressing each other!

2976
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:46,070
Can I grab?

2977
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:47,830
Oh, I thought I could grab you.

2978
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:48,290
We're fine.

2979
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:52,670
Okay, she threw a thing at us.

2980
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:53,950
Leave us alone!

2981
01:37:55,150 --> 01:37:56,570
We have to drop!

2982
01:37:56,890 --> 01:37:57,910
We're just so cute!

2983
01:37:58,090 --> 01:37:59,630
We're just having a nice little time!

2984
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:00,510
This is so unfair!

2985
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:02,450
Leave us alone!

2986
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:06,290
We have to fucking make money for our families!

2987
01:38:06,650 --> 01:38:07,610
Leave us alone!

2988
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,050
We have to fucking make money for our families!

2989
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:08,050
We're dead!

2990
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:09,250
You don't have families!

2991
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:09,970
There's a...

2992
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:13,690
Wait, why do I keep getting...

2993
01:38:13,690 --> 01:38:16,330
Wait, how do I keep getting just the pitch?

2994
01:38:17,170 --> 01:38:19,030
You couldn't get that one!

2995
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:20,670
You couldn't get that one!

2996
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:20,910
She couldn't fucking...

2997
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:22,310
She's stuck!

2998
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:23,910
Look at her!

2999
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:25,950
She's fucking stuck!

3000
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:26,930
What a loser!

3001
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:29,490
What a loser!

3002
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:31,730
Look at her!

3003
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:33,570
Wait, she's almost dead!

3004
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:34,870
We can actually kill her!

3005
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,670
We can actually kill her!

3006
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:39,950
We can actually kill her, guys!

3007
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:41,030
Get back here!

3008
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:41,930
Get back here!

3009
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:42,830
We can kill you!

3010
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:44,570
We know you have a weakness now!

3011
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:47,730
No, she's almost dead!

3012
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:48,590
We can kill her!

3013
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:49,430
Get her down!

3014
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:53,110
We're so bad!

3015
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:55,230
We're so bad!

3016
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:56,030
We're so bad!

3017
01:38:58,450 --> 01:38:59,810
Wait, she's over here.

3018
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:01,950
I'm gonna fucking throw up!

3019
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:04,450
Get out!

3020
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:05,970
Get out of here!

3021
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:08,150
I'm gonna fucking throw up!

3022
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:08,790
This is right!

3023
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:11,010
I'm so sorry!

3024
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:13,770
Don't worry!

3025
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:15,270
Why would you hurt me?

3026
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:17,150
What is she doing?

3027
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:19,850
I don't know.

3028
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:21,270
I'm waiting for you to go anywhere.

3029
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:23,190
We'll keep healing.

3030
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:24,070
Ow!

3031
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:26,890
Oh shit!

3032
01:39:28,210 --> 01:39:29,490
Can you help me?

3033
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:30,290
I'm saving you!

3034
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:31,310
Don't worry!

3035
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:33,570
We can kill her!

3036
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:35,310
She's about to murder!

3037
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:37,750
She can't get away forever!

3038
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:40,010
Get over here!

3039
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:41,450
She went to the roof!

3040
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:42,170
Get back inside!

3041
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:42,730
Get back inside!

3042
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:47,490
She's in the roof!

3043
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:48,850
She's gonna put you in the roof!

3044
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:54,690
She's fucking figuring out our weakness.

3045
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:55,690
The outside.

3046
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:58,130
The moment we're inside, we're safe.

3047
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:00,510
We're only safe when we're inside.

3048
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:01,750
We haven't done anything.

3049
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:02,610
We still have five more candles.

3050
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:03,690
We need our five candles.

3051
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:08,010
Where the fuck would the candles be?

3052
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:08,550
We're here!

3053
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:09,610
She's here!

3054
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:09,990
She's on me!

3055
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:11,790
She's on me!

3056
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:12,330
She's on me!

3057
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,170
I slowed her down!

3058
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:19,810
I slowed her down!

3059
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:20,390
Oh shit!

3060
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:23,770
I need you guys to pick me up here!

3061
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:25,290
Rescue me!

3062
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:26,050
Hello!

3063
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:27,230
Medic!

3064
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:27,770
Medic!

3065
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:28,550
Medic!

3066
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:30,930
Oh wait!

3067
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:31,470
What the fuck?

3068
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,030
Medic!

3069
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:32,390
Medic!

3070
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:32,790
Medic!

3071
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:34,410
We gotta heal each other!

3072
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:37,890
The mo- we can- Oh fuck.

3073
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:39,570
I'm okay.

3074
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:40,410
I'm okay.

3075
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:40,810
I'm okay.

3076
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:42,550
Oh she's- oh that's a dog!

3077
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:43,770
Oh shit!

3078
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:44,810
Oh fuck!

3079
01:40:45,150 --> 01:40:45,730
Oh my god!

3080
01:40:46,330 --> 01:40:47,110
Oh no!

3081
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:48,210
Oh no!

3082
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:49,370
No we're not!

3083
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:49,930
No we're not!

3084
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:52,310
She doesn't see me!

3085
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:54,570
What the fuck bro?!

3086
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:57,490
Can you get down?

3087
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:58,530
Oh wait shit!

3088
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:01,150
You're coming with me!

3089
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,210
Get up!

3090
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:02,510
Stop!

3091
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:03,850
No!

3092
01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:10,850
You couldn't even get her out!

3093
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:12,190
You couldn't even get her out!

3094
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:13,930
Oh wait I'm gonna- What the fuck?

3095
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:16,610
Where did she go?

3096
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:18,710
Oh there she is!

3097
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:19,150
She's stuck!

3098
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:24,590
Kill her!

3099
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:25,090
Kill her!

3100
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:25,270
Kill her!

3101
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:26,010
She can't!

3102
01:41:26,010 --> 01:41:26,530
She can't!

3103
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:28,410
She can't fucking leave!

3104
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:29,970
She's like one inch me!

3105
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:30,770
She's literally one!

3106
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:32,850
Get her ass!

3107
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:34,630
Get her ass!

3108
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:36,950
She's one!

3109
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:38,330
Oh fuck!

3110
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,090
She's so dead!

3111
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:40,950
She's so dead!

3112
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:41,530
We did it!

3113
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:42,970
Wait!

3114
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:46,110
That's fucking right!

3115
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:51,190
You don't like my dark side?

3116
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:52,830
What the fuck?

3117
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:53,550
You- Alright.

3118
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:56,270
Okay.

3119
01:41:56,690 --> 01:41:59,630
Well we know who's the worst demon out there.

3120
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:00,790
I know!

3121
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:06,390
We know who's the worst one out there.

3122
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:08,390
We know who's the worst one out there.

3123
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:09,850
I'm trying to figure out what the thing is!

3124
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:12,630
I see what's hard cause!

3125
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:13,470
It is!

3126
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:14,730
It is hard!

3127
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:17,510
Alright I won't shit on you again.

3128
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:19,850
I'm sorry.

3129
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:24,730
This is the last game I can get a redemption arc as a demon for our last game or something.

3130
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:25,530
Alright.

3131
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:25,530
Alright.

3132
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:25,570
Okay.

3133
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:27,390
Okay.

3134
01:42:27,410 --> 01:42:27,950
You got this.

3135
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:28,570
Okay.

3136
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:29,370
Wait.

3137
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:30,330
Wait wait.

3138
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:31,930
Before you guys mute me.

3139
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:32,990
Where should we go?

3140
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:36,230
Like do you want a manor, hotel, house, or the asylum again?

3141
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:37,630
Which one have we not done?

3142
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:38,550
We should do the asylum.

3143
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:41,150
Cause like we haven't gotten to actually do the asylum.

3144
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:41,230
Doki?

3145
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:41,790
Doki?

3146
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:44,270
The last one was the asylum.

3147
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:44,850
I know!

3148
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:47,230
Whichever one honestly.

3149
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:49,830
Whichever one really.

3150
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:51,110
Which one was the easiest?

3151
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:57,010
For Jun- I think the one that I was in was fairly easy.

3152
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:58,310
Oh the hotel?

3153
01:42:58,690 --> 01:42:59,070
Yeah yeah.

3154
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:04,550
If it wasn't and it becomes hard that just makes my ego better though cause that means that I did well on it.

3155
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:06,130
Okay.

3156
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:07,730
I'll do my best.

3157
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:08,210
Trust.

3158
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:10,570
I believe in you.

3159
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:14,130
Okay.

3160
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:15,430
Now I'm gonna kill that kid.

3161
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:16,690

3162
01:43:17,210 --> 01:43:18,610
Alright I'm the engineer again.

3163
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:18,970
We're back to the OGs.

3164
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:21,090
We figure out how to play this time.

3165
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:22,910
Alright muting.

3166
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:24,590

Alright.

3168
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:26,210
I can finally heal.

3169
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:28,930
Oh I still can't do the buff.

3170
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:31,450
I wanna get the dove.

3171
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:35,110

3172
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:35,890

3173
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:40,170
I can't grab anything.

3174
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:40,710
What the fuck?

3175
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:44,330
Oh someone doesn't have enough XP.

3176
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:46,010
Oh wait I'm stupid.

3177
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:46,410
Oh.

3178
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:49,610
Okay I have armor.

3179
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:52,810
Someone's in armor to defend all those inside it.

3180
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:53,210
Dash.

3181
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:54,850
Okay we're good.

3182
01:43:54,910 --> 01:43:55,150
We're good.

3183
01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:55,370
We're good.

3184
01:43:55,410 --> 01:43:56,010
Okay I'm ready.

3185
01:43:57,490 --> 01:43:58,250
Spiritual burst.

3186
01:43:59,310 --> 01:43:59,690
Shockwave.

3187
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:00,070
Orbs.

01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:02,450
I got telekinesis.

3190
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:03,550
Can I?

3191
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:04,910
Can I invest in it?

3192
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:05,570
I got everything.

3193
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:06,210
Alright.

3194
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:06,670
Hello.

3195
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:08,730
Did you get the dog clicker?

3196
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:09,710
Hello.

3197
01:44:10,230 --> 01:44:11,230
Were you able to get the dog?

3198
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:12,750
Did you get the dog?

3199
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:13,250
Dog clicker.

3200
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:14,470
I don't know.

3201
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:14,710
What does it look like?

3202
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:15,170
It's in the middle here.

3203
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:15,830
Yeah yeah.

3204
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:16,230
It's right here.

3205
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:19,270
Did you get it?

3206
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:19,930
Oh yeah I did.

3207
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:21,770
Oh my god we have the dog.

3208
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:22,550
Okay guys.

3209
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,110
We can do this.

3210
01:44:25,270 --> 01:44:26,010
We're gonna win.

3211
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:27,230
We're so... Okay.

3212
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:28,550
We can do this.

3213
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:29,410
There's no way.

3214
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,610
As long as we stick together we're fine.

3215
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:32,610
Oh yeah I got the car.

3216
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:35,310
We gotta find candles.

3217
01:44:36,030 --> 01:44:37,630
We gotta find candles.

3218
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:38,970
Where the fuck are the candles?

3219
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:40,730
Okay easy.

3220
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:41,210
Okay.

3221
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:42,710
Oh I found one.

3222
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:43,150
I found one.

3223
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:44,570
I found two.

3224
01:44:44,670 --> 01:44:45,110
I found two.

3225
01:44:45,230 --> 01:44:45,510
Wait wait wait.

3226
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:46,170
What does it look like?

3227
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,430
It's just a candle.

3228
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:49,590
It's just like this.

3229
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:49,970
Oh okay.

3230
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:50,710
Oh!

3231
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:51,490
Yeah yeah yeah.

3232
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:52,250
Oh I see I see I see.

3233
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:52,610
Yeah yeah yeah.

3234
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:55,110
Okay we have... We need two more.

3235
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:55,650
We need two more.

3236
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:56,870
Alright.

3237
01:44:58,690 --> 01:44:59,110
Okay.

3238
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:00,250
Use this right now.

3239
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:04,590
I don't think we need armor right?

3240
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:05,810
What does the magnetic detector do?

3241
01:45:06,030 --> 01:45:07,550
It senses a demon.

3242
01:45:08,670 --> 01:45:09,090
Wait.

3243
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:09,510
Yeah.

3244
01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:10,290
Oh that's her!

3245
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:10,670
That's her!

3246
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:11,550
That's her!

3247
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:13,310
That's why she jumped!

3248
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:15,030
NPCs can't jump!

3249
01:45:15,190 --> 01:45:16,030
I figured it out!

3250
01:45:16,670 --> 01:45:17,730
NPCs don't jump!

3251
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:18,930
That's automatically her!

3252
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:19,390
Oh my god.

3253
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:20,610
You fucking fucking cunt!

3254
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,990
Oh no she's actually... She can navigate!

3255
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:25,650
Oh no!

3256
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:26,790
Oh no she...

3257
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:27,910
She knows how to crawl!

3258
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:29,850
No she knows how to crawl!

3259
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:32,050
What a freak!

3260
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:35,890
What a literal fucking freak.

3261
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:38,030
Freak!

3262
01:45:38,030 --> 01:45:41,050
This is why you got bullied and became a demon!

3263
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:45,550
Okay we need a...

3264
01:45:45,550 --> 01:45:47,490
We need to find the...

3265
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:49,290
We need to find one more candle.

3266
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:51,090
Ooh doggie!

3267
01:45:51,150 --> 01:45:51,410
Wait.

3268
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:53,710
I can actually do my task.

3269
01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:54,250
Oh my god.

3270
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:55,670
Oh huge!

3271
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:55,930
I'm doing it!

3272
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:56,590
Oh my god huge!

3273
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:00,210
She's finally learned.

3274
01:46:01,050 --> 01:46:02,410
We need to find another candle.

3275
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:03,610
We're literally missing one candle.

3276
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:07,950
Oh!

3277
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:08,830
No that's bandage.

3278
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:09,530
Where the fuck?

3279
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:12,410
How about matches though?

3280
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:16,430
We're literally missing one candle!

3281
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:18,150
Oh no guys.

3282
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:19,570
I split up with the gang.

3283
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:21,050
This is not good.

3284
01:46:22,030 --> 01:46:24,430
Look this is important for the candle though.

3285
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:25,790
Would there be candles upstairs?

3286
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:27,730
There'd be candles upstairs.

3287
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:28,830
Right?

3288
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:31,410
Collect blood from crying statues?

3289
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:35,010
Maybe there'd be candles upstairs.

3290
01:46:35,970 --> 01:46:37,030
Wait do we do it?

3291
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:38,730
Am I stuck?

3292
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:39,890

01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:53,930
She's a demon!

3347
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:55,810
Demons don't deserve love!

3348
01:48:57,130 --> 01:48:58,230
She's so sweet.

3349
01:48:58,350 --> 01:48:59,250
She's so sad.

3350
01:48:59,290 --> 01:49:01,210
She's just manipulating you.

3351
01:49:01,330 --> 01:49:02,690
She's just acting.

3352
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:04,670
It's just acting.

3353
01:49:07,190 --> 01:49:08,330
It's just acting.

3354
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:09,890
Don't be...

3355
01:49:09,890 --> 01:49:11,970
Don't be a little bitch.

3356
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:14,870
Alright we gotta...

3357
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:17,170
Alright guys we gotta find the circle.

3358
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:18,630
Do you think it's in the basement?

3359
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:20,410
I thought it'd be outside.

3360
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:22,170
Or it could be.

3361
01:49:22,330 --> 01:49:24,370
Or maybe it's in the weird altar place.

3362
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:26,750
It says like place the blood vial.

3363
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:27,790
We gotta find...

3364
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:29,130
What the fuck are you doing?

3365
01:49:29,490 --> 01:49:29,510
Oh!

3366
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:34,170
Why were you looking at this poor man?

3367
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:35,630
Bro!

3368
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:38,650
What did you do to this poor guy?

3369
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:39,850
Bro what the fuck?

3370
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:41,370
What is wrong with you?

3371
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:46,290
What is wrong with you?

3372
01:49:46,890 --> 01:49:48,390
What is wrong with you?

3373
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:50,630
Alright maybe downstairs.

3374
01:49:50,970 --> 01:49:51,790
It could be downstairs.

3375
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:53,830
You think?

3376
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:54,510
Yeah yeah.

3377
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:55,910
It has to be downstairs.

3378
01:49:56,570 --> 01:49:57,550
Wait where's Bree?

3379
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:58,870
I'm gonna try and keep her.

3380
01:49:59,010 --> 01:49:59,290
I'm gonna go downstairs.

3381
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:00,010
Bree?

3382
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:02,150
Bree will be fine right?

3383
01:50:02,490 --> 01:50:03,010
Oh well she'll be fine.

3384
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:04,890
Yeah she's full HP.

3385
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:05,830
There's no way.

3386
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:08,290
Yeah she's got all those vices.

3387
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:08,990
Yeah yeah.

3388
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:10,010
And all those syringes.

3389
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:11,770
Yeah I knew it!

3390
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:12,750
I fucking knew it!

3391
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:14,590
Oh what the fuck you...

3392
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:16,830
Oh you knew it.

3393
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:20,990
Alright she knew it too.

3394
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:21,550
Apparently.

3395
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:24,230
June is coming.

3396
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:25,370
I'm so confused.

3397
01:50:25,530 --> 01:50:26,350
I don't know how they...

3398
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:29,110
She's so confused.

3399
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:33,130
Oh not the lights.

3400
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:34,970
We gotta figure out the lights.

3401
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:37,990
Oh there's a circuit breaker right here.

3402
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:38,670
Oh nice.

3403
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:41,390
Dude this is like the thing I'm best at.

3404
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:42,690
Just keep fixing it.

3405
01:50:42,990 --> 01:50:45,490
When you have five sets of electric...

3406
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:46,510
That's your old job!

3407
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:48,870
You literally got a degree for this.

3408
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:49,410
I'm literally Doki.

3409
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:49,990
Yeah?

3410
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:51,950
Let me show you my license.

3411
01:50:52,110 --> 01:50:52,630
Here you go.

3412
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:52,950
Nice.

3413
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:54,250
Finally.

3414
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:57,690
It took her 20 years to get her medical degree.

3415
01:50:58,190 --> 01:50:59,310
We gotta find...

3416
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:00,450
electric cables.

3417
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:01,530
Where would that be?

3418
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:04,130
I've never seen what it looks like either.

3419
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:05,450
Maybe out...

3420
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:06,290
Oh!

3421
01:51:06,810 --> 01:51:07,810
We found the generator.

3422
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:09,310
Yeah yeah.

3423
01:51:10,910 --> 01:51:12,590
Yeah I'm gonna go upstairs and see.

3424
01:51:13,190 --> 01:51:16,840
Oh here's another one.

3425
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,200
Oh we found two generators.

3426
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,040
What would the electric cable look like?

3427
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:22,480
Yeah.

3428
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:25,120
What would the cables look like?

3429
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:26,040
Yeah.

3430
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:26,980
I don't know.

3431
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:28,900
We got the generators.

3432
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:30,140
I got more matches.

3433
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:31,440
I'm right here behind you.

3434
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:32,400
Juna!

3435
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:35,420
Where are you Juna?

3436
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:40,940
Juna you're not beating the allegations about you and your skills in monsters.

3437
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:42,540
Juna you're not beating the allegations about you and your skills in monsters.

3438
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:43,000
I don't like this.

3439
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:44,980
Oh that's you.

3440
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:48,660
That was on reflex.

3441
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:50,340
Juna!

3442
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,320
Juna!

3443
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:53,680
Where the fuck?

3444
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,420
Where is the electric cable?

3445
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,800
I don't know what they look like.

3446
01:51:58,940 --> 01:51:59,800
I don't know either.

3447
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:01,620
Oh this has to be something.

3448
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:03,280
Oh we put a generator here.

3449
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:04,220
That's our goal.

3450
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:06,120
We have to go here.

3451
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:09,160
Maybe downstairs?

3452
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:10,620
Maybe go back in basement?

3453
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:11,480
Maybe.

3454
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:14,200
Where the fuck did Juna go?

3455
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:16,460
Juna!

3456
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:18,180
Juna get back here Juna!

3457
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:22,120
Everybody always possesses the elderly.

3458
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:23,040
Juna we know you're on the roof.

3459
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:23,520
Get down!

3460
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:25,480
Juna we know... No she's back.

3461
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:27,620
Oh no she's literally right here.

3462
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,240
Juna get back here Juna!

3463
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:31,360
Juna!

3464
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,540
I'm just a baby.

3465
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:39,560
You were laughing at the dog.

3466
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,520
It's perfect.

3467
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:46,420
Holy shit.

3468
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:48,220
I'm not letting you swim in my little ear.

3469
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,420
Unless you wanna be my next fucking meal.

3470
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:53,900
Oh I found it!

3471
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,420
I found it!

3472
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:55,180
I found it!

3473
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:56,000
It's just on the floor.

3474
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,240
It's just like wires on the floor.

3475
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:59,300
Oh oh oh okay.

3476
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:00,400
Okay okay.

3477
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,420
Just look on the floor.

3478
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:01,600
No!

3479
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:04,340
Why the fuck did you do this to this poor man?

3480
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:05,960
Damn Juna.

3481
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:06,600
Juna!

3482
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:10,500
Juna this is not looking good for you.

3483
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:12,160
That'll be five dollars.

3484
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:13,100
Alright.

3485
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:14,100
Five dollars?

3486
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,240
Is that him?

3487
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:17,960
What the fuck?

3488
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,240
That's not Juna.

3489
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:21,840
That can't be Juna.

3490
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,020
No it's just a man.

3491
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:25,840
Oh yeah it's just a man.

3492
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:28,440
Just a man.

3493
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:29,320
Just a man.

3494
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:31,560
Oh shit.

3495
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:33,120
The demon has turned it off.

3496
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:35,860
Oh my god.

3497
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:36,540
Where the fuck?

3498
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:37,420
Oh there's another generator.

3499
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,640
Find the incantation table.

3500
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:42,800
Oh hey.

3501
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,120
Hey what are you doing?

3502
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:49,900
No no no no no.

3503
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:51,260
I have a family.

3504
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:53,900
You're right!

3505
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:54,840
I'm sorry!

3506
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,180
I'm sorry!

3507
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:57,720
I'm sorry!

3508
01:53:58,440 --> 01:53:59,400
You're right!

3509
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,060
You're right!

3510
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:01,180
You're having family!

3511
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:17,320
Please!

3512
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:18,520
Please don't!

3513
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,940
I also have a family!

3514
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:22,160
Please!

3515
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:23,620
Please!

3516
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,940
What happened to family?

3517
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:29,160
What happened to family?

3518
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,980
What happened to family?

3519
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:34,560
I don't understand!

3520
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:39,840
I've been nothing but kind!

3521
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:43,520
What?

3522
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:44,940
What?

3523
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:47,900
Oh!

3524
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:48,040
Oh!

3525
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:48,100
Oh!

3526
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:52,870
Nice!

3527
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,310
Okay.

3528
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:54,510
Okay we're okay.

3529
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:56,490
We're okay now.

3530
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:58,070
We're okay.

3531
01:54:58,630 --> 01:54:59,650
Oh my god.

3532
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:00,670
How do I get back inside?

3533
01:55:01,630 --> 01:55:03,730
How do I get back inside?

3534
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:05,930
We're okay now.

3535
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:10,630
I'm restoring the power.

3536
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:12,930
I hope that's like...

3537
01:55:12,930 --> 01:55:13,250
Oh nice.

3538
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:15,250
Bro this electrical...

3539
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:18,550
This electric cable shit is so difficult!

3540
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:28,160
Are you guys okay?

3541
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:35,580
Are you guys okay?

3542
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:38,140
Bro where the fuck is the electrical cable?

3543
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:39,540
I found it!

3544
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,760
Guys I found it!

3545
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:41,520
Go to the table!

3546
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:44,300
Guys!

3547
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,420
I found it!

3548
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:47,320
Go to the table!

3549
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:50,540
Why is this so hard?

3550
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:52,920
Why do I do it?

3551
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:54,340
It's so hard!

3552
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:55,180
Junet!

3553
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,020
Just stop being a little girl!

3554
01:55:58,800 --> 01:55:59,580
Oh my god!

3555
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:00,760
Okay I'm here!

3556
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:01,760
I found it!

3557
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:02,200
I found it!

3558
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,140
We go to the table!

3559
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:05,940
We go!

3560
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:06,480
We go outside!

3561
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,680
Oh my god!

3562
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:09,620
Bro!

3563
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:13,100
Oh my god it actually worked for the first time ever!

3564
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:15,280
It worked for the stupid anti-invisibility thing!

3565
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:15,580
It worked!

3566
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:18,220
Get the fuck out of here!

3567
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,320
Get out of here!

3568
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:22,840
Get out of here!

3569
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:23,860
Get out of here!

3570
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:25,120
Nobody!

3571
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:29,700
Where did she get up with ugly ass fucking stupid bitch?

3572
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:31,100
It's cause I had armor bitch!

3573
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:34,260
It's cause I had armor bitch!

3574
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:35,200
It's cause I had armor bitch!

3575
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,740
Oh guys guys we gotta like not let her just do that to us.

3576
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:39,540
Let's just go to the table.

3577
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:40,440
Guys let's just go.

3578
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,320
Guys where the fuck I left?

3579
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:46,880
I left.

3580
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:48,600
I know what the objective is.

3581
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:52,020
Where the fuck?

3582
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:52,960
Where is it?

3583
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:53,480
Whoa!

3584
01:56:55,660 --> 01:56:56,220
Oh.

3585
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,020
Hey.

3586
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:00,120
Hey.

3587
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:00,900
Hey.

3588
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:01,740
Hey.

3589
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:02,500
Hey.

3590
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:02,940
Hey.

3591
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:09,600
Okay so she's right behind me.

3592
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:10,420
She's right behind me.

3593
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:11,300
She's right behind me.

3594
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:11,520
Yeah!

3595
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:14,220
Hey!

3596
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:18,080
Finding the table!

3597
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:19,360
Woo!

3598
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:22,100
Where the fuck is the table?

3599
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:22,780
Oh I found it.

3600
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:23,300
Nice.

3601
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:24,320
Objective time.

3602
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:28,340
Oh no.

3603
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:29,300
Okay.

3604
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:32,020
Okay.

3605
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:34,640
There we go.

3606
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:36,620
And then...

3607
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:38,200
Am I...

3608
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:38,780
Is this correct?

3609
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:41,100
No.

3610
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,440
No that was not correct.

3611
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:44,840
Okay.

3612
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:46,980
Sorry they're distracting...

3613
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:49,980
They're distracting Juna for me while I figure this out.

3614
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:51,580
There we go.

3615
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,940
And then we're just gonna keep turning until this hits.

3616
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:54,920
Yeah!

3617
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:58,140
I did it!

3618
01:57:58,360 --> 01:57:59,900
Oh no am I bugged forever?

3619
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:02,160
Collect electric...

3620
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:03,520
Oh no I bugged myself.

3621
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:05,140
Oh no.

3622
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:05,560
Oh.

3623
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:09,140
Oh.

3624
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:09,360
Oh.

3625
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,140
Did I bug myself?

3626
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:11,540
No I didn't.

3627
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:13,560
Oh no I can't run.

3628
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:14,660
No.

3629
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,260
I can't run.

3630
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,140
No.

3631
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:21,400
Guys!

3632
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:23,880
Oh no.

3633
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:24,960
Guys!

3634
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:25,960
Wait!

3635
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:27,460
How did they all die?

3636
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,460
What did you do Juna?

3637
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:32,360
What did you do?

3638
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:36,580
What happened?

3639
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:38,800
What happened?

3640
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:39,100
What do you mean?

3641
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:41,740
How the fuck did they all die?

3642
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,900
I was doing a puzzle!

3643
01:58:43,460 --> 01:58:49,500
I was doing a puzzle!

3644
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:51,000
I was doing a puzzle!

3645
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,440
Okay tell me how you got the...

3646
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,080
Get away!

3647
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,100
You wanna talk about it?

3648
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:56,840
I don't want it!

3649
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,460
You wanna talk about it?

3650
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:00,680
No!

3651
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:04,480
I don't want to talk about it!

3652
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:10,200
I can't...

3653
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:10,560
I can't...

3654
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,200
How the fuck did you guys die?

3655
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,420
I was doing a puzzle!

3656
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:17,060
Juna you're too good at this!

3657
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:18,600
I was doing a puzzle!

3658
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:19,380
What happened?

3659
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,420
We were doing a puzzle.

3660
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:24,940
I just saw you and then we both went down.

3661
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:26,700
And I turned back to ask for help.

3662
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:27,620
And you just disappeared.

3663
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:31,200
I thought you were okay.

3664
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:31,640
I thought you were okay.

3665
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:32,320
I was trying to... Oh no.

3666
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,120
I was trying to...

3667
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,800
I was like oh they'll be fine.

3668
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,280
I'm gonna do this puzzle and then...

3669
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:37,820
No!

3670
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:39,600
No we weren't!

3671
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,380
You were not fine.

3672
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:46,520
I was a little bad in the beginning but...

3673
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:47,740
Yeah you were natural.

3674
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:48,460
It makes sense.

3675
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:49,480
Redemption arc.

3676
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:52,080
The Juna redemption arc right there.

3677
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:53,800
I went from 40 minutes to 14.

3678
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:55,340
That was so good.

3679
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:58,860
The evil laughing throughout really sucked.

3680
01:59:58,860 --> 01:59:59,700
I know right?

3681
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,900
I just hear her fucking devilish laughing.

3682
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,540
That was great.

3683
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,460
I was like we do this.

3684
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:14,480
I know.

3685
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:16,460
Holy shit.

3686
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:18,740
You didn't mean to purposely leave them though right?

3687
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:20,020
No I was like it'll be fine.

3688
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:22,700
I'm gonna do the fucking puzzle.

3689
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:24,260
Yeah you purposely left us.

3690
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:25,920
You purposely left us.

3691
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,080
It'll be fine.

3692
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:30,240
I'm gonna do the puzzle.

3693
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:32,080
They're gonna protect me from the puzzle.

3694
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:32,880
No.

3695
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:34,440
No.

3696
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:36,600
I'm sorry.

3697
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:39,020
I learned things off my shoes.

3698
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,660
I'm sorry you relied on the wrong people.

3699
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:42,600
I'm sorry.

3700
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:46,880
I realized that was a mistake.

3701
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:52,400
I was the medic and I was always the first one going into a shooter.

3702
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,000
I had one gun and it was Elisa Rage.

3703
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:01,920
I was like oh maybe I shouldn't have left.

3704
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:04,740
Oh yeah you think?

3705
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:09,320
I'm so glad that crossed your mind.

3706
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:10,120
Yeah.

3707
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:11,420
It's like you.

3708
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:14,400
Definitely shouldn't have left.

3709
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:17,580
It's okay.

3710
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:18,500
It's okay.

3711
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:19,900
That was fun.

3712
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:21,680
That was awesome.

3713
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:25,100
This is why we had to go in blind without the tutorial.

3714
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:25,900
I'm sorry.

3715
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:26,880
It's better.

3716
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:34,360
It's better because the demon is so overpowered when you figure out how to actually play the demon.

3717
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:43,200
I was like when I played and the first thing I heard was oh my god she knows how to play the game.

3718
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:43,900
Oh no.

3719
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:49,860
I was like oh no.

3720
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:52,000
We're not gonna have a good time.

3721
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:53,400
She knows how to play.

3722
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:55,400
It's okay.

3723
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:59,020
But I guess I actually have nothing else to say.

3724
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:00,720
The demons we made along the way.

3725
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:03,800
The people we killed along the way.

3726
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:06,240
The new appreciation for elderly women.

3727
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:07,820
We're so nimble.

3728
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:09,960
Oh my god.

3729
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:11,380
Children and the elderly.

3730
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:12,420
Who would have thought.

3731
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:13,940
I feel like I just did something unethical.

3732
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:15,560
I gotta go to the nursing home and bring them cupcakes.

3733
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:18,340
I gotta do some community service now.

3734
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:21,280
I feel like I'm morally obligated right now.

3735
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:22,160
They deserve it.

3736
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:24,040
They're coaching.

3737
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,720
The next elderly could be the next demon.

3738
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:29,860
You'll never know.

3739
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:33,820
Remember, treat your elders right or else they might kill you.

3740
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:34,440
Yeah, exactly.

3741
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,840
This is why we put them in homes.

3742
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:39,780
Because we're worried about them turning into demons.

3743
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:44,060
They'll just turn into demons between each other.

3744
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:47,080
Retirement homes are actually like homes for demons.

3745
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:47,540
Churches.

3746
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:48,020
Yeah.

3747
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:51,540
Abuela, no.

3748
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:54,140
Abuela.

3749
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:55,300
Abuela.

3750
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:58,340
We gotta be safe.

3751
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,960
We gotta be safe.

3752
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:01,520
Do any of you guys have announcements?

3753
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,500
For like the coming week?

3754
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:05,500
It's just a physical lab.

3755
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:12,100
I mean like it's like I normally just ask and then they're like, wow that's so cool you're so slay.

3756
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:15,440
I mean be nice again.

3757
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,260
You need to be nice.

3758
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:19,760
She's like nice?

3759
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:20,500
What?

3760
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:22,380
What are you doing?

3761
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:24,100
That has to be a genius right?

3762
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:26,380
Nobody's nice for no reason.

3763
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:27,800
What do you mean?

3764
02:03:28,540 --> 02:03:30,260
I always ask this question.

3765
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:32,320
It's true.

3766
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:32,700
She does.

3767
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:33,100
It's true.

3768
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:35,100
I'm like, Kai, do you have anything upcoming?

3769
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:37,760
And she goes, yeah I'm gonna do this and that.

3770
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:38,980
I'm like, oh wow that's so nice.

3771
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:44,660
That's exactly what the words are that she says every time.

3772
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,240
That's exactly how I sound.

3773
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:46,940
I'm like, oh my god.

3774
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:49,980
Baby, are you the baby Kai?

3775
02:03:55,410 --> 02:03:56,330
Oh my god, the baby.

3776
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:56,790
Yeah.

3777
02:03:57,590 --> 02:03:58,590
I feel like we had role play session.

3778
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:02,830
We were doing it before the collab as well by the way.

3779
02:04:03,330 --> 02:04:05,590
I think I walked into some role play shit.

3780
02:04:07,210 --> 02:04:14,950
It's like a VR chat where you join a random world and then there's these two people around.

3781
02:04:18,870 --> 02:04:20,870
It's okay Jenna, she doesn't understand this.

3782
02:04:20,890 --> 02:04:23,050
She doesn't understand our bond, our relationship.

3783
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:25,790
No.

3784
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:26,630
It's just like.

3785
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:29,910
I like it, you know, like doing it in public like this PDA.

3786
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:32,670
Is this a part of it?

3787
02:04:33,070 --> 02:04:33,710
Is this part of it?

3788
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:34,150
No, this is part of it.

3789
02:04:35,110 --> 02:04:37,810
Are you part of it to do it in public?

3790
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:39,230
So like people would watch?

3791
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:42,390
No, bro, that's when everything's out.

3792
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:43,690
We're still covered, bro.

3793
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:45,350
So now?

3794
02:04:45,950 --> 02:04:47,190
We're still covered.

3795
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:50,570
We have like, we have space for Jesus too.

3796
02:04:52,330 --> 02:04:54,850
Also the baby.

3797
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:58,090
Are you the baby?

3798
02:04:58,090 --> 02:04:59,670
Is this an exhibition?

3799
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:01,190
Yes, this is...

3800
02:05:02,530 --> 02:05:05,630
It's not exhibition because there's no private parts to key.

3801
02:05:08,350 --> 02:05:10,030
We're still clothed.

3802
02:05:10,030 --> 02:05:10,430
Jesus.

3803
02:05:12,850 --> 02:05:13,570
Amen.

3804
02:05:16,910 --> 02:05:19,450
Now we know who's definitely going to hell.

3805
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:24,890
She learned something from the demons.

3806
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:31,390
We know gates are closed for someone here.

3807
02:05:35,350 --> 02:05:36,770
That was fun.

3808
02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:37,570
Thank you.

3809
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:40,730
Thank you for inviting Kai and Bri.

3810
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:42,030
Thank you for inviting me.

3811
02:05:42,030 --> 02:05:43,690
Thank you for joining me.

3812
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:45,170
For playing this game with me.

3813
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:47,190
I was going to try this game out.

3814
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:48,130
So thank you guys.

3815
02:05:48,330 --> 02:05:49,550
I hope that was fun.

3816
02:05:49,870 --> 02:05:51,990
We had a lot of fun murdering people.

3817
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:53,570
Yeah, I had a great time.

3818
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:54,470
I agree.

3819
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:57,390
GG guys.

3820
02:05:58,410 --> 02:06:00,870
I'm going to go talk to my chat now.

3821
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:03,510
Bye guys.

3822
02:06:05,170 --> 02:06:05,650
Bye.

3823
02:06:05,690 --> 02:06:06,170
Bye.

3824
02:06:06,170 --> 02:06:06,590
Bye.

3825
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:08,290
That was so fun.

3826
02:06:08,590 --> 02:06:10,530
I think that was really, really fun guys.

3827
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:13,050
It was great meeting them for the first time.

3828
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:14,110
I've never talked to them before.

3829
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:16,070
I talked to Juna before.

3830
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:20,130
She actually went to one of my meet and greets a long time ago.

3831
02:06:20,130 --> 02:06:22,110
I think I told this story before.

3832
02:06:22,310 --> 02:06:25,030
Obviously there's no vibes of it anymore.

3833
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:37,690
Juna was actually one of the I think the only Vtuber that came to my meet and greet and purposely requested to meet me during one of my meet and greets.

3834
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:42,090
And he brought her fucking screen over to talk to me and everything.

3835
02:06:42,570 --> 02:06:50,110
And I know I'm her Oshi so I was like I'll ask her if she wants to meet me.

3836
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:52,250
I'll ask her if she wants to do a collab with me.

3837
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:55,810
Because I remember that I was one of her Oshis.

3838
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:58,250
And I said you can invite anybody to join us.

3839
02:06:58,370 --> 02:06:59,530
Because I really want to play this game anyway.

3840
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:00,330
So I was like you know what?

3841
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:02,270
I'll ask her if she wants to play.

3842
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:04,310
And I had a great time.

3843
02:07:04,570 --> 02:07:07,970
I had a great time playing with Juna, Kai, and Bri.

3844
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:08,750
They were really fun.

3845
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:13,150
You know what Bri's voice reminds me of?

3846
02:07:13,490 --> 02:07:20,070
Bri's voice reminds me of Remember when I was showing you guys that song above from Garfunkel?

3847
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:21,590
Like what's her name?

3848
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:30,050
Her voice fucking reminds me like literally was like almost exactly like that.

3849
02:07:33,890 --> 02:07:35,650
Oh my god what was her voice?

3850
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:38,370
It was literally almost me, you, and Steve.

3851
02:07:38,490 --> 02:07:44,710
Yeah I was like oh my god her voice is literally just like her voice.

3852
02:07:44,890 --> 02:07:46,210
It was like Kate Micucci.

3853
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:47,490
That's her name right?

3854
02:07:47,490 --> 02:07:50,210
Yeah she sounds just like Kate Micucci.

3855
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:51,870
No joke.

3856
02:07:52,110 --> 02:07:53,710
Like literally one to one.

3857
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:58,990
Because like Kate Micucci was the voice of um the ducktales.

3858
02:07:59,030 --> 02:07:59,890
What was her name?

3859
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:00,630
Ducktales.

3860
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:02,250
The girl in Ducktales.

3861
02:08:02,270 --> 02:08:02,830
The little girl.

3862
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:05,490
Uh fuck what was her name?

3863
02:08:07,190 --> 02:08:10,470
Ah what was that little girl's name in Ducktales?

3864
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:11,850
Uh...

3865
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:17,190
You know what I'm talking about?

3866
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:17,470
Like...

3867
02:08:17,490 --> 02:08:18,770
What was that name?

3868
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:20,610
Uh...

3869
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:22,550
That little girl in Ducktales!

3870
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:23,630
Oh my gosh girl.

3871
02:08:23,890 --> 02:08:25,030
I'm just gonna google...

3872
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:25,790
Webby!

3873
02:08:25,950 --> 02:08:27,930
She sounds just like Webby!

3874
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:29,370
Doesn't she?

3875
02:08:29,490 --> 02:08:33,090
I was like oh my god that's literally Webby's voice!

3876
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:47,470
Because like um Kate Micucci like has like the same the same like uh she does like a lot of voice acting for TV shows and like she literally sounds like her.

3877
02:08:47,490 --> 02:08:47,610
.

3878
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:47,870
.

3879
02:08:51,450 --> 02:08:52,130
Who does?

3880
02:08:52,250 --> 02:08:52,670
Uh Brie!

3881
02:08:52,890 --> 02:08:53,290
Brie!

3882
02:08:53,370 --> 02:08:57,130
Brie literally sounds like Webby from Ducktales.

3883
02:08:57,290 --> 02:09:02,510
I was like I was like trying to remember I was like oh my gosh this is like one to one exactly her voice.

3884
02:09:02,990 --> 02:09:03,390
.

3885
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:06,490
.

3886
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:08,690
I was like holy shit that's literally her.

3887
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:14,430
Like how like people are like oh my god Doki you sound like that fucking girl in Gravity Falls.

3888
02:09:14,670 --> 02:09:15,670
Even though I don't think so.

3889
02:09:15,710 --> 02:09:16,650
I don't think I sound like her.

3890
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:23,290
I think like I would sometimes hit the intonations of her but like I don't think I I personally don't think I actually sound like her.

3891
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:24,590
Like what's her name?

3892
02:09:24,790 --> 02:09:28,030
I keep forgetting but like the girl who's that main character.

3893
02:09:28,130 --> 02:09:28,310
Mabel.

3894
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:34,210
Yeah sometimes apparently sometimes I can sound like Mabel when I talk but I don't I don't hear it.

3895
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:37,830
But I think if I go higher I think if I go a higher pitch I sound like Mabel.

3896
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:38,810
Um .

3897
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:40,970
Yeah.

3898
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:56,070
So but I swear Brie sounds exactly like Webby from DuckTales and she sounds like cause like the actress does like so many voice acting where like different uh uh well Velma!

3899
02:09:56,590 --> 02:09:59,570
It's like a mix between Velma and Webby.

3900
02:10:03,890 --> 02:10:09,670
It sounds just like it sounds like almost like Velma and Webby if you think about it.

3901
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:10,950
Like if you just listen to it.

3902
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:19,010
And I was like oh my god every time she opens her mouth I was like oh my god I feel like I feel like that's just Velma and Webby.

3903
02:10:20,330 --> 02:10:21,290
It's so cool.

3904
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:24,770
It's so cool I was like it's such a unique voice.

3905
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:27,970
Um it's like a really unique voice too.

3906
02:10:28,130 --> 02:10:29,910
So I was like that's really cool.

3907
02:10:30,230 --> 02:10:32,470
Um anyway I had a great time.

3908
02:10:32,510 --> 02:10:33,510

3909
02:10:33,670 --> 02:10:36,190
