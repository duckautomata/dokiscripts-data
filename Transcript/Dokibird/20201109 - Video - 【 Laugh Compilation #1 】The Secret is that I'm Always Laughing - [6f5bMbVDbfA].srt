1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
Alright, alright, alright.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,480
Take a full screen!

3
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,040
Okay, okay, like this, right?

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,060
Ah, there you go.

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,520
Perfect!

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,460
That's perfect, right?

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,060
Ah, yeah, this is very, very spooky.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,380
I'm scared.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,140
There you go.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,560
Perfect!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,880
I can pick shit up!

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,760
Push,

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,360
pull, push, pull!

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,780
Okay, maybe I need to get my cat out of the way.

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,460
Okay.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,880
Can I jump off?

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm not doing so well.

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,540
Oh, oh, wait, you can.

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,940
I thought that would be invisible.

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,500
Wow.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,480
Can I pick up a shoe?

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,540
I can pick up a shoe!

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,340
I can pick up a shoe!

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,240
I can pick up a shoe!

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,160
What the

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:20,990
fuck?

27
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,990
There's a fall damage here!

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,790
There's a fall damage!

29
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,170
Why?

30
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,970
Why the fuck is there fall damage?

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,610
Oh!

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,310
It was at this moment that he knew.

33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,650
He fucked up.

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,130
Wait!

35
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:36,550
Stop!

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:36,890
Stop!

37
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,490
Can I sprint?

38
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,050
Oh, wait, you can sprint!

39
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,930
Why did no one tell me to sprint here?

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,730
I've been fucking walking this entire time.

41
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,230
You can sprint in this game.

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,430
Why is it here so tiny?

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,950
Look around by using...

44
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,150
Wow!

45
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,570
By using arrow keys?

46
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,250
Oh, shit!

47
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:55,770
Oh!

48
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,270
Oh!

49
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,270
I was like...

50
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,370
Oh, shit!

51
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,590
Oh, shit!

52
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,810
Oh, shit!

53
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,330
Oh, shit!

54
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:06,410
I thought I was...

55
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,970
Don't check under the bed.

56
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,070
Don't check under bed!

57
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,230
Don't check under the bed!

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,240
Crying.

59
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,380
Yeah you little bitch.

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,660
Yeah, you little bitch.

61
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,860
I thought that is me.

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,560
Oh, no!

63
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

64
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,120
No!

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,560
Nooo!

66
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,120
No!

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,280
No!

68
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,620
I'm not spooked at all.

69
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,380
I'm just fine.

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,740
This is too cute.

71
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,140
You're so smart!

72
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,800
Holy shit, look at...
