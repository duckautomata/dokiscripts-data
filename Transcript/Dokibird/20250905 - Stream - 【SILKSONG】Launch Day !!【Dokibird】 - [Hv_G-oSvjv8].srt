28
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,560
I think it's a fucking terrible idea that there was no pre-order.

29
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't care if it, like, hikes for PR, whatever the fuck.

30
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,040
This is a terrible fucking, this is not good.

31
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,760
This is, I'm angry.

32
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,680
I told this to my friends, too.

33
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,660
They're like, oh my God, there's no pre-order.

34
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,180
Oh my, I was like, you do know.

35
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,260
With it not having a pre-order, they're like, oh, there's no pre-order.

36
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:51,180
everyone has a fair i was like you do know if there's no pre-order steam is gonna crash like i knew it was gonna crash i knew it because because everyone's talking about stuff it's been seven years it's been fucking seven years it's gonna crash there's no way the servers are going to be able to handle this and this is the one game that needed a pre-order and they didn't put to preach i can't even pay i accidentally added the game five fucking times because i was trying because they kept telling me oh shit my controller i need to close my door just in case my neighbors yell at me because it's seven in the morning i was so tired but this made me so awake and i actually added five the game five times because it was like oh um um there's an Aaron adding it,

37
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,740
but then it still added.

38
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:02,240
And then I was trying to remove the game, remove all four copies of the game, and then it took fucking forever to remove all the copies.

39
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:10,400
And then, and then after that, I actually removed all the games.

40
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,880
I accidentally removed all of them.

41
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,840
And so I had to re-add the game again

42
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:50,240

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,180
Steam still refuses to accept my money.

96
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,860
Oh my god, they have to boot up fucking Gogg all the time.

97
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,280
You can't capture Galaxy installed.

129
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,880
Oh, shit.

130
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,540
Oh, my God.

131
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,620
It's an Espanola.

132
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,260
I jumped too much.

133
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,740
And now it's in Spanish.

134
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,580
Reduce.

135
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,560
Back.

136
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,480
We're in.

137
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,700
It took 25 minutes.

138
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,360
I'm God gaming now.

139
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,860
I'm trying to remember.

140
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,260
I think this was 8.

141
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,700
And this was 10.

142
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,700
I'm pretty sure.

143
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,580
All right.

144
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,360
Sound guy.

145
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,560
This is your time.

146
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,820
I need a gnome.

147
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
I think this was...

148
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,380
Oh, yeah.

149
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,000
Okay, we'll do it now.

150
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,980
Alright, I gotta make sure.

151
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,820
Video, borderless.

152
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,040
Ah, borderless is fine.

153
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,560
Blur quality.

154
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,760
Okay, low.

155
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,580
We don't need blur.

156
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,680
Okay, maybe we need to cap the frame rate.

157
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,160
Yeah.

158
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,500

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,310
They gave us Y2K on Steam.

166
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,630
They didn't listen to me.

167
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,050
Oh, Fire Loom.

168
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,730
Is this a prequel?

169
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,610
I think it is, because, like, seems like a prequel because there was Silk there.

170
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,830
For Silk Song.

171
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,190
Where were you when Silk Song killed?

172
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:57,770
What?

173
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,600
Hey, that's me.

174
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,540
I should be allowed to use a gun.

175
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,520
Just like dad.

176
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,580
Gun, gun!

177
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:15,940
Pop!

178
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,040
Alright.

179
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,580
I jump, she jump.

180
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,820
I jump, she jump.

181
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,760
So immersive.

182
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,020
So immersive.

183
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,400
Okay.

184
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,080
Oh, she's like... Oh, she's on a shrimp.

185
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,700
Look at her.

186
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,480
Look at her.

187
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,260
She runs like a shrimp, too.

188
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,720
I first pick up a Glock.

189
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,060
Pop, pop.

190
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,220
What if I can?

191
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:45,980
Oh, I...

192
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,680
Okay, okay.

193
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,020
Wait, I have something special to show you guys out to.

194
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,140
Watch this.

195
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
Birds are singing.

196
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,560
You're gonna have a bad time.

197
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,160
Bum, bada, bada.

198
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,530
Okay.

199
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,930
There you go.

200
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,110
Sorry, I had to.

201
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,070
I had to.

202
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,010
Oh, shit.

203
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,750
She has like...

204
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,890
She can dangle off a cliff.

205
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,330
There you go.

206
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,690
I'm sorry.

207
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,150
Dan Stokey Bird is real.

208
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,950
Okay, I thought I could kill that one, too.

209
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,750
I was like, no bug left behind.

210
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,030
No way, he also, dad also has a normal knife.

211
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,690
A normal knife when we're in London.

212
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,850
Okay, there you go.

213
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,710
Where's this?

214
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,290
What's this?

215
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,310
Oh, it's just, uh...

216
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,950
It just feels a little weird.

217
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,650
The frames do feel a little weird.

218
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,070
I'm going to put it to...

219
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,230
I'll put it at 120.

220
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,390
And see if that's better.

221
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,290
The frames do feel a little weird, doesn't it?

222
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,490
Alright.

223
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,730
Oh, shit.

224
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,810
What the fuck?

225
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,770
It full healed.

226
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,170
No.

227
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,450
No bug left up at high.

228
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,890
It full heals when you charge it up.

229
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,580
It feels a little slow.

230
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,400
But I don't know.

231
00:23:39,520 --> 00:24:08,700

232
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,600
Oh no, I tripped.

233
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,580
Don't worry, I'm okay.

234
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,620
Oh no, never mind.

235
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,860
I'm too tall.

236
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,580
My bones are too fragile.

237
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,420
It feels too fragile.

238
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,660
Don't worry, I'm okay.

239
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,360
I'm okay now.

240
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,680
Wait, what's down here?

241
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,040
Oh, I knew it.

242
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,360
I knew there was something over there.

243
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,040
What is that?

244
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,500
Rosary string.

245
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,460
You can't double jump yet.

246
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,440
Sadly.

247
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,720
My bones are too frail for that.

248
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,780
What is that?

249
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,560
Worm string holding a...

250
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,380
Can be broken and the loose...

251
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,660
Oh, it's for trading.

252
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,600
Alright.

253
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,780
Catling bugs?

254
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,120
Oh shit.

255
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,760
What the fuck?

256
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
What the fuck does Scott combo me?

257
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,560
I like, okay, I like the quality of life changes.

258
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,660
I like the quality of life changes where when you charge it up, it heals everything.

259
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,780
So, every, you get, you don't have to charge it one by one.

260
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,160
That's nice.

261
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,160
I like that.

262
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,180
That's called being, that's like the, the tall buff.

263
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,380
Don't worry, I can be tall just like you watch this.

264
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,660
Wait, why am I not tall?

265
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,880

And you could have been here too.

273
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,600
Why would you remove him?

274
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,080
Why would you remove him?

275
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,600
He has a gun.

276
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,520
Oh, is that the boss?

277
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,880
Okay, first boss.

278
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,380

00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,910
Okay, you can't go straight down.

You can't do any other way.

297
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,600
Yeah.

298
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,580
Pogo was too OP.

299
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,520
Also, are any of my sound guys alive?

300
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,980
Okay, that boss was fucking easy.

301
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:41,740

00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,760
Is the sound good?

303
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,780
Oh my god, I can't jump anymore.

304
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,440
My bones.

305
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,940
My bones so weak.

306
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:55,720
What?

307
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,820
We boys were supposed to be this tall.

308
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,980
Sound is good?

309
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,480
Okay.

310
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,120
Oh my god.

311
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Grandma.

312
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,640
Granny.

313
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,180
Hello.

314
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,760
I'll wake you up.

315
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,680
I won't have any dying on my floor.

316
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,800
Awake, at last.

317
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,180
You should mind your shrink, traveler.

318
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,580
There's no use wasting energy on old nobody like me.

319
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,900
I see that now, madam.

320
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,260
My welcome to your land has not been kind.

321
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,180
I had a reason to be wary.

322
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,440
So you're another pilgrim then.

323
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,980
You just got out of the darkness to climb the great path and bow has...

324
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,580
skilled at peak.

325
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,540
Oh, I talk too?

326
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,240
Oh, it's because I'm not hollow.

327
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,540
I have a soul.

328
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,560
I have actual personality.

329
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,620
How dare she have a personality?

330
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,160
How would I impose my beliefs on you?

331
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,120
I am no pilgrim.

332
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,520
I am hornet.

333
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,920
And I arrive in your land by no choice of my own.

334
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,340
I was brought to your kingdom, my forest, captured by strange bugs, clad, and veils.

335
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:53,980
oh how curious the bugs of the citadel at the summit of our land they veiled themselves in service to their fate or perhaps as slaves to something greater then i shall seek their citadel and these veiled bugs would go to such lengths to bring me here i intend to find out why oh ferocious intimidating There is no pilgrim spirit.

336
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,400
You're the bearing of a hunter.

337
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:05,240
Welcome, then, fierce traveler, to Fireloom, our holy yet haunted land.

338
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,740
Before you depart, permit an old bug a brief warning.

339
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,220
Best keep that weapon down.

340
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,540
Our kingdom is gripped by a curse.

341
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,440
It's past go wild and dangerous.

342
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:37,080
some still attempt to climb to the citadel and its crest none return to speak of what they see i'm not gonna i'm not gonna put down my weapon i have a right to bear arms pop pop

343
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,960
back in hollowness i can carry my gun wherever i go pop pop

344
00:31:49,910 --> 00:32:56,450
you very played well and you skill no doubt I don't mean any unkindness when I say you say you still seem a little frail I was a long time I was a long time spent captive bound by seal string to me my strength is diminished but recoverable by time I reach that citadel I'll be ready to face what waits all right let's go I like how she goes like trip mode when she runs there's like a little Naruto run oh okay i can up the audio just a little i can up it to here i don't know if that's too loud though it's very loud on my end when i do that i'll just do actually i'll do like nine and then i'll up overall volume on discord or not on the skirt sorry on obs uh there you go maybe that would be better there you go yeah that might be better Let me know that's better.

345
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,310
I'll go down now.

346
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,510
Oh, that's where I live.

347
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,390
Okay.

348
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,210
Okay.

349
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:13,670
I'll just fall straight down, I guess.

350
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,710
Okay.

351
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,550
I don't know.

352
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,430
I assumed that was the right way to go.

353
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,330
It seemed like it.

354
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,510
How was I supposed to know?

355
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,970
Okay, at least I know how to get there.

356
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:36,650
It's so weird not being able to...

357
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,330
I think it is a little weird not being able to...

358
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:46,910
Oh, what's the word?

359
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,350
To not be able to pogo.

360
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,050
Yeah.

361
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,730
I'm not used to it.

362
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,550
I've been pogoing for so long.

363
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,710
I can't believe they nerfed pogo.

364
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,130
Pogo too strong!

365
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,030
A patch notes hit hard!

366
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,850
Okay, I wanted to check if there was a secret there.

367
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,920
No, it's just a dash.

368
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,460
It's a dash jump, so you know what she's like?

369
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,340
Adidas!

370
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,640
There you go.

371
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,560
She just can't look- Oh wait, there's something- how do I get- Okay, I must be- I must have to do like...

372
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:27,640
Adidas!

373
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,880
Oh my god.

374
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Oh, I can...

375
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,420
Oh!

376
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,100
Okay, I can mid-heal.

377
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,720
That's cool.

378
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,260
I like that.

379
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,060
Oh.

380
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,500
Actually, I didn't go this way.

381
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,060
Fuck!

382
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,780
Wait, do I need a dash for this?

383
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,600
Let's see.

384
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,560
Or can I just...

385
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,880
Okay.

386
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,960
It's so awkward when you can't pogo.

387
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,720
I'll see it.

388
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,020
It really is very awkward when you can't pogo.

389
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,610
Oh my god.

390
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,290
I feel like I have...

391
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,570
Oh, that was...

392
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,010
Wait, what?

393
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,910
Oh my god, it was nothing.

394
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,310
It was just extra money.

395
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,410
There was nothing, yeah?

396
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,290
It's diagonal, pogo, yeah.

397
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,290
It's so weird, though.

398
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,210
Okay.

399
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,910
Okay, so it's full heal, no matter...

400
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,410
Jesus Christ, Jane, you're OP as fuck.

401
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,990
Hold on, I have to do it one...

402
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,210
Back in my day, like last week.

403
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,090
Back in my day.

404
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,150
Last week, it's a full heal no matter how big the...

405
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,310
No matter how big the thing is.

406
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,850
Last night.

407
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:48,930
Alright.

408
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,390
Seven years.

409
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:50,990
Yeah, no.

410
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,690
Lucky for me, I just started playing Hollow Knight last week.

411
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,430
Yippee!

412
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,770
Back in my day.

413
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,290
One week.

414
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:32,600
exactly one week ago I can't get it I'm too I'm too short the one time I'm too short not one time I'm just too short all right off I'll go don't jump into the hole again what is that just don't jump into the hole and everything will be Hello?

415
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,350
Going bottom.

416
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,530
Yeah.

417
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:45,770
Hmm.

418
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,150
A fellow pilgrim.

419
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,370
Are you about to start your great journey to the holy city up top?

420
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,950
I am no pilgrim, sir.

421
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,690
Though it seems we'll be traveling a similar path.

422
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,590
I'm not a pilgrim.

423
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,790
Well, it makes no difference, I suppose.

424
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,250
We all must walk the roads up and up.

425
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,530
Though most of us will fall long before we see the grand gates.

426
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,770
If you're wise, you'll stop here and rest a while.

427
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,250
We're heading out into that dangerous world.

428
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,570
Alright, I sit.

429
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,170
I sit.

430
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,110
What else?

431
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,810
Rest here with me as long as you like.

432
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,810
I'm not ready to leave yet.

433
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,530
Top.

434
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,930
Yeah, I can talk.

435
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,090
Where are you?

436
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,510
Peb.

437
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,130
Oh, traveler.

438
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,910
Destined for the Citadel, yes?

439
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,870
Well, where are you in park?

440
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,470
Won't you stop and make a trade with an old pilgrim?

441
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,570
I'd see your wares, madam.

442
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,930
Though I fear I may have nothing worth for you to offer in return.

443
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,230
Oh, where are you not?

444
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,070
Do you like buying goods to trade?

445
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:32,970

Praise the bug!

447
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,770
They say it'll help you gather up rosaries on the road ahead.

448
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,690
You'll come back and share some with me, won't you?

449
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:45,870
Oh!

450
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,270
Okay.

451
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,350
Oh, I... Wait, no, I have to...

452
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,730
Wait, okay, I gotta go back... Wait.

453
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,410
Okay, there you go.

454
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,530
That's like 30.

455
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,910
Okay, that was just 30.

456
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,110
I don't have more.

457
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:56,650
I'm sorry.

458
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,730
Wait, do I have anything?

459
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,070
Let's see.

460
00:38:59,090 --> 00:38:59,950
There's a mask.

461
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,010
The shinier...

462
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:02,170
Okay.

463
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,110
Okay, so this is for upgrading now, I assume.

464
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,150
And then there's a key.

465
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,850
Hey, guys, thank you for the super chat.

466
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,570
Thank you, thank you.

467
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,430
Subscribe to Doki.

468
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,930
Most importantly, remember to like the stream and comment from time to time.

469
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,010
Yeah, thank you.

470
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,030
Thank you for the super chat.

471
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,610
Hey, guys.

472
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,510
Thank you, thank you.

473
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,010
You won't go losing them.

474
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,810
It might seem, but it takes some time to keep him properly secure.

475
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,130
Oh, so you can...

476
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,710
I see.

477
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,290
So you can, like, find your rosaries.

478
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,290
You might lose them.

479
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,770
What's this your building, sir?

480
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,490
Oh, there's Flick, the Fixer.

481
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,390
A sign of some kind?

482
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,050
Aye, aye.

483
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,110
You're a sharp bug.

484
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,510
A wish wall.

485
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,270
It's past time.

486
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,370
This old camp had one.

487
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,010
As the resident fixer, I've taken it upon myself to sort it out.

488
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,570
Your popular thing about Farloom, wish walls, useful too.

489
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,170
So many prayers.

490
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,590
left unanswered.

491
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,050
Gives him a place to go.

492
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,650
Okay.

493
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,290
Oh my god.

494
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,690
There's like wish shit here too.

495
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,670
There's nothing here.

496
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,870
Go this way.

497
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,310
Whoa.

498
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,630
He's like a dangerous place.

499
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,710
Okay, so we're either stopping a cult or we're going to kill someone else's guide.

500
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,430
It's one or the other.

501
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,750
It could be both.

502
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:50,750
It could be a it could be both a cult and we're going to kill a god we only have one god here and this uh the white prince or whatever his name is it's it's like her dad my dad's the god here how dare these bugs not follow my dad's law

Okay nice Oh this has to be a god fight Or like a boss fight Oh wait it's just one guy Stupid Oh never mind Oh oh it's a trap There we go I missed the Pogo.

506
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,570
Me too.

507
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,590
That's stupid.

508
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:42,590
Oh shit!

509
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,170
It's fine.

510
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,410
I don't want to heal just yet.

511
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:58,630
Because I can't Pogo, I need to be more, like, understand where I am at all times.

512
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,150
Which is a little...

513
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:01,790
Oh, whoops.

514
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,370
Okay, I guess I can't do that.

515
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,270
I guess I missed.

516
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:07,850
Oh, nice.

517
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,490
Yoink.

518
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:09,970
Yoink.

519
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,690
My rosaries now.

520
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,030
So now there's two types of currencies.

521
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,430
One is this, and the other one is the...

522
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,770
Oh, hey.

523
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,790
Who are you?

524
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,290
Hey, did you see it?

525
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,130
Red maiden?

526
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:29,530
The great gate heard my song, and in its infinite age, you kind of opened the way forward for us.

527
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,270
What luck for us to meet at this moment!

528
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,510
We can set off on a great road together!

529
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,050
Or perhaps, I'll tarry you just a little longer.

530
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,970
I want to sing a song of gratitude to this noble gate.

531
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,210
I'm Sherma, by the way.

532
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,390
Just another humble pilgrim like yourself.

533
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:56,410
If you ever need assistance on the road ahead, sing out my name, and I'll be sure to find you.

534
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:00,010
Me and my lucky charm are at your service.

535
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,730
Also, Recycle Bin, they got five gifted ships they can take you.

536
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,310
Sherma?

537
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,170
No, Sherma.

538
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:16,790
Yay, gate, gate, gate Nice to skate I've met Yay, gate, gate Greatest miracle yet Ha ha ha!

539
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:27,730
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

540
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,710
A little stupid, but she's got the spirit, you know?

541
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,150
She is the loo-loo.

542
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,750
They're dumb but cute.

543
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,710
I'll spare her.

544
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,930
I get, we'll spare her because she's just a cute little dumb bug.

545
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,010
Okay, we gotta grab the rosaries.

546
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,310
I'm gonna rob these religious bugs of their rosaries.

547
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,830
Okay, I'll sit down here.

548
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,150
Insert rosaries.

549
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:09,690
Oh.

550
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,440
Okay.

551
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,320
What the fuck?

552
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,720
I was gonna say, is that my chair?

553
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,720
Oh, it's just here.

554
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:25,530
Alright, wait.

555
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:27,890
Is she still back there singing to the gate?

556
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,470
Let's check.

557
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,310
I feel like we're killing a god.

558
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,250
I feel like we're going to kill the god of whatever this cult worships.

559
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,010
Oh, she's god.

560
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,270
My bullets over here, though.

561
00:44:40,750 --> 00:45:11,250

562
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,270
Who gave dad a gun?

563
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:17,490
He has the right to bear arms tomorrow.

564
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:21,750
There you go.

565
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,660
Go this way.

566
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,660
Where's our map guy?

567
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,340
I can't open a map.

568
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,800
I swear to God, if I don't have a map, I'm gonna, oh, I'm gonna.

569
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,340
I have yet to, there's no ability to open a map yet.

570
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,360
Oh my god.

571
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,570
Not being able to Pogo is...

572
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,960
It's like fucking with me right now.

573
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,460
Not being able to Pogo.

574
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,270
This is like...

575
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,010
I had to do like a dash kick.

576
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,250
There you go.

577
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:02,490
This is like the closest I can to Pogo.

578
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,130
I don't miss hit... I don't miss Cornelius, okay?

579
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,230
I just wish he didn't have a fucking monopoly of maps.

580
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,910
Like...

581
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,710
That's different.

582
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:20,490
Alright.

583
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:30,310
These platforms are brittle as fuck, just like my bones.

584
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,970
Thankfully, you never once got lost ever.

585
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,910
Holy shit, he does double the damage.

586
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,870
Because look how tanky he is.

587
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,070
When I heal, I yell out.

588
00:46:46,070 --> 00:47:10,930
okay yeah that means i'm gonna go this way because there's a platform higher so i knew it i was like there has to be an item here uh eating thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you yeah i never get lost oh nice okay i have a crest i have a crest now what's my crest warm but allows one to collect more shells shards from oh okay let's get shell shards

589
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,360
I still don't know what the shell strides are for.

590
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,200
Because, like, the currency here are, like, rosary beads.

591
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,960
I wonder what they're for in this game.

592
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,960
I can still go up, but I won't go this way first.

593
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:32,450
Okay.

594
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,030
Oh.

595
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,530
He has, like, blades on his shell now.

596
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:40,370
Okay.

597
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,390
The worst part of playing on launch is that no one knows where they go.

598
00:47:53,130 --> 00:48:12,230
You see, if All I'm saying is If it wasn't on the Oh my, I can't dash yet She doesn't know how to dash Her legs are too long No one can help me What's that?

599
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,290
I don't know what that sign None of us know what the sign means I didn't

600
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,850
We don't know what that sign means.

601
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,670
Where am I?

602
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,160
I don't know.

603
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,220
Oh my god, I did a loop.

604
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,780
We're in the Metrovania part now.

605
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,140
I'll go this way.

606
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,060
I'm at the ground floor now.

607
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,340
Alright, I go this way then.

608
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,500
What does it mean?

609
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,860
Oh, we don't get one guy out of not upgrading your nail this time.

610
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,280
Yeah, Meti!

611
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,180
Okay, this way.

612
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,860
Oh, look, I can float.

613
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,400
Mm-mm.

614
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,100
But thank you for the super chat.

615
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,380
Thank you.

616
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,140
Thank you.

617
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,940
Okay, this way.

618
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,240
I guess I had to go back up.

619
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,480
Because there's, like, nothing here.

620
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,060
So I assume it's up.

621
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,300
I'm gonna skip these guys.

622
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,120
There's no point.

623
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,080
Fuck the skull in particular.

624
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,620
The glass, thank you for the super chat thing.

625
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,360
Thank you.

626
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:38,980
Alright.

627
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,330
Oh shit.

628
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,010
Ah!

629
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:51,650
I hate that.

630
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,210
I hate it.

631
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,750
I'm like reflex pogo-ing right now.

632
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:55,810
Alright, here.

633
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,870
I was looking at my other skin, got jump scared.

634
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,530
I've been framed again.

635
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,590
You've been framed by your fellow.

636
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,550
The only reason why I called you up was because I was looking at Twitter and everyone said it was Medi's fault.

637
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,370
So I just assumed you were the main culprit.

638
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,350
Because I said rat somebody.

639
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:21,690
And everyone on Twitter was like, I can't believe it was Medi that said that.

640
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,260
Like I said, I was like, you'll always blame.

641
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,380
Um, not me.

642
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,880
I pulled this from chat.

643
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,680
That was this.

644
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,060
I go back in here.

645
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,500
Now I'm getting...

646
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,980
Oh, shit.

647
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,060
Nice.

648
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,340
The bones of the dead monks that I can rob.

649
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,260
It's okay.

650
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,300
I don't believe in their god, so I can't go to their hell.

651
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,300
My god is literally my dad.

652
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,780
If you think of...

653
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,220
Oh!

654
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,360
Where am I?

655
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,820
Where did that?

656
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,840
Take me

657
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:29,960
My dad owns my heaven Yeah, my dad my god can beat up your guy What the fuck are these?

658
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:33,700
Oh, hello.

659
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:39,320
Oh Poshanka edge is sharp and sensitive keen.

660
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:48,800
In my land, that is the way warriors greet each other, for though you were a child barely hatched, you were also a warrior.

661
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:53,460
Your stance, your weapons, your movement all proclaim it so.

662
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,560
You have keen sight for my skill, bug, but my childhood has long since passed.

663
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,100
What has happened here?

664
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,620
I see signs of battle all around.

665
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:13,320
These strange, shuffling pilgrims in the camp below, They were docile enough, but up here, they seem to have lost their senses.

666
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,240
They cry out to the darkness and attack their fellow travelers.

667
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,460
Akanesh, keep your weapon drawn and your bearings true.

668
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:28,620
The way ahead is winding, and to lose one's way invites only death.

669
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,440
I am a navigator amongst my tribe.

670
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,460
Oh, she's a new...

671
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,240
Oh, my improvement.

672
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,820
I told you guys.

673
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,540
They made so much quality of life changes.

674
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,020
She is a quality life change.

675
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,220
I can't believe it.

676
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,980
They did everything.

677
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,540
She's our new map girl.

678
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,200

And supplies, if you wish.

681
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,680

00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,250
Goodbye, Cornelius.

685
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,110
You got...

686
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:42,090
I got an upgrade now.

687
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,210
Alright, nice.

688
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,870
I don't have enough for a quill.

689
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,250
Alright, press...

690
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,270
Oh my god.

691
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:55,610
Big strong lady is extorting me for money.

692
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:59,590
And these lands name are given freely, are they not?

693
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,910
I am Sharka.

694
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,050
Wealding wings.

695
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:08,610
If our hunt intertwines again, I will have new maps to trade.

696
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:12,630
Until then, farewell, child-wielding needle.

697
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:14,590
Wait, how am I going to find you again?

698
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,830
Who are you calling for, Sharka?

699
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,250
Your voice echoes through the caverns.

700
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:25,470
I came deeper into Farlum in search of my mentor, the greatest of my tribe.

701
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,190
I could not keep Peso and her trail grew grown.

702
00:54:30,210 --> 00:55:04,550
So she will have traveled much farther by now, but if I keep moving and stay vigilant, with her okay I am broke shell markers bench pins compass okay I am broke why do you take the currency of whoa oh my god this is definitely a quality of life change okay almost a quality of life change oh what did she draw this with a fucking crayon?

703
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:05,550
Is it?

704
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:11,090
This was drunk with a goddamn crayon.

705
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,910
Like, what am I looking at?

706
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:19,290
at least she sings for you.

707
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:27,090
She drew, I swear, this looks like she drew it with a goddamn rock or a crayon or something.

708
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,890
Okay, there's a bench here.

709
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:31,890
Well, there is a bench by a cat.

710
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,270
Paper is hard to come by.

711
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:36,890
I'm not talking about paper.

712
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:38,330
Look at this map.

713
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,610
Look at what she drew.

714
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,520
Okay, this is the moss lands now.

715
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:51,620
Hello.

716
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,340
What the fuck?

717
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,200
Did you guys see that?

718
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,560
Oh, wait.

719
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,380
They have rosaries.

720
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,600
Oh my god.

721
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,320
It's time.

722
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:02,400
Oh.

723
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,240
Oh, this is a prequel.

724
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,760
This is a prequel.

725
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,540
Look, look the silk thread.

726
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,840
I don't know.

727
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,800
I still can't tell.

728
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,500
I still can't tell.

729
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,260
This feels like a prequel.

730
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,760
I'm still like not 100% sure.

731
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,220
Oh my god, they're actually crazy bugs.

732
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,420
They can be saved.

733
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,640
I don't think so.

734
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,520
Okay.

735
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,900
Oh, I can't tell.

736
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,460
It feels like a prequel with how everything is.

737
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,360
It could be a prequel sequel.

738
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,400
Yeah, a chair.

739
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,500
Okay, now I can equip this.

740
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,120
How does this equip work?

741
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:58,640
You can tell it was a prequel because they haven't learned how to draw yet.

742
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,920
Papa Smurf, thank you, the Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

743
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,540
Okay, I can...

744
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,020
Alright, I can farm these guys.

745
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,240
Oh, I have enough.

746
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,680
I have enough for a quill now.

747
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,500
Happens around this.

748
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,820
There's no way I travel.

749
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,800
I can travel all the way to this new land while John Hollow Knight is doing all that shit.

750
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,280
I'll soon leave the crumbling roads, but if you stop by the southern bull, we may meet again.

751
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,380
I pass there often to trade with the pilgrims.

752
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:32,880
Yeah, I need a quill.

753
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,040
Nice.

754
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,980
All right, you stay here.

755
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,540
I'm gonna beat up more monks.

756
00:57:40,400 --> 00:58:10,720

Jesus, it sounds so pathetic.

758
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:17,660
When?

759
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:25,570
Okay, I need, like, a rosary collector thing.

760
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,030
Okay, how much do I need?

761
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,150
It was 70, right?

762
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,230
Oh, whoops.

763
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,070
Yeah, I'm here to hustle.

764
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,850
Yeah, I need the other map, too.

765
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,910
But, like, I can collect that later.

766
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,230
This is... Alright.

00:58:42,410 --> 00:59:00,570

774
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:52,320

775
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:59,800
The beatings will continue until my wallets, my wallets fall.

776
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:05,150
Here we go.

777
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:09,930
There we go.

778
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:13,470
I don't know how much I can buy now.

779
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:18,430
I don't know if there's an actual efficient way.

780
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,210
infinite money.

781
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,890
I don't know if there's an actual if... No, we'll do one more.

782
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,050
One more for the road.

783
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:30,130
Efficient way to do this.

784
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,090
But like, for now I'm doing it like this.

785
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:34,630
This is...

786
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,570
Alright, now I'll buy.

787
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,050
I'll buy my compass and my map.

788
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,120
A lot, lot, lot.

789
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,900
See, Cornelius didn't sing for us.

790
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,180
This is a quality of life change.

791
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:59,980
Cartography, pah, bakalo, is a craft skill common amongst my tribe.

792
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,260
Most important to keep one's mind sharp when on a journey.

793
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:12,320
The charting of caverns, the memory of travel, the knowing of one place within the kingdom, an engaging task for a warrior's mind.

794
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,460
And a fortunate thing that my great mentor never liked the skill.

795
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,260
The talent at getting lost, I should almost be impressed.

796
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,520
She's me!

797
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:50,160
yeah okay 70 only that and then we'll also need this the bench bins and then it's time 40 more don't worry don't worry i'm back don't worry my fellow monks i'm back i need my money did you pay your protection money yet that's right the protection money is gonna protect you from me

798
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,620
need for you.

799
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,260
She's back.

800
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,240
I ain't done with you.

801
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,240
That's right.

802
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,720
Come back alive.

803
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,960
It's collection time.

804
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:17,560
There we go.

805
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,860
I wonder if it's faster if I do this.

806
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,400
It's almost done.

807
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,340
Don't worry, we need like 40 more.

808
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,800
Because I need my Moss Lab maps, too.

809
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:38,240
This doesn't end until the big strong lady is satisfied.

810
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,100
Alright, every little bead counts.

811
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,100
Yeah, that's right.

812
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,400
They have debts to pay.

813
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,340
I'm a debt collector.

814
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,760
I hear you.

815
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,760
We need like, I think it's like two more.

816
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:03,700
One more time.

817
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,340
I'm literally like...

818
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,680
I'm literally like three beads off.

819
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,040
I lie, lie.

820
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:12,820
Oh!

821
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:18,300
At least we know exactly where the map woman is.

822
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:19,880
Alright, that's enough.

823
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,940
I'll just kill this one for fun.

824
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,560
That's right.

825
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,280
I might... I had enough beads.

826
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,940
But this time, this is for pleasure.

827
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,200
Okay.

828
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,600
Yeah, yeah, mama.

829
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,180
Alright, here we go.

830
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,720
I soon leave.

831
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,240
Oh, there we go.

832
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,460
Alright, now we're fine.

833
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,520
Oh, I didn't even need...

834
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,380
Oh, it was $40.

835
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:48,060
Whoops.

836
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,600
They were both for pleasure.

837
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,840
It was actually $40.

838
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,200
Oopsie.

839
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,100
All right, we'll go this way.

840
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:00,940
Oh, what's this?

841
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,120
Oh, this is a boss fight.

842
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,320
Unless...

843
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,740
Don't worry, I'll free you.

844
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:13,910
Okay, never mind.

845
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,470
Just stay stuck, I guess.

846
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:19,910

01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:25,710

849
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,030

01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:05,770
I need to learn the silk song.

854
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:06,530
Oh my god.

855
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,050
I need to learn actual silk song for that.

856
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:15,070

So these are also crazy, guys.

860
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:28,250
When...

861
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:28,470
Oh!

862
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:29,450
Shit!

863
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:34,550
I was not expecting her to fucking projectile vomit me there.

864
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:36,850
That's fucked up.

865
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,770
How do I- That's it.

866
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:40,550
Really?

867
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,150
Oh, it does three healing.

868
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:43,650
Okay.

869
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:46,570
Now I know.

870
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:48,850
I'll put in that.

871
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,110
Fuck this whore.

872
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:51,930
I'm not dealing with that shit.

873
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:56,010
Oh, oh, there's a trap there.

874
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,630
I'm not.

875
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:02,350
I need to remember I can't dash jump.

876
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:03,850
Or I can't pogo.

877
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:07,830
I need to remember that.

878
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,330
Weaver of our loom.

879
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,670
By grace you're warded.

880
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:12,930
By thread you heal.

881
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:14,610
For your favor, internal.

882
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,190
We offer our song.

883
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:17,050
Oh.

884
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:19,450
This is where I learned these silkside.

885
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:23,880
Okay.

886
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,920

887
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,440
I still don't know what the...

888
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:30,740
Oh shit.

889
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,620
I thought I was being...

890
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,120
Clever.

891
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:33,840
Okay.

892
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:38,400
I assume this is where I have to learn the Silk Song.

893
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:42,380
I'll learn it for here.

894
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,660
Oh my god.

895
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,840

01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:50,680
Nice.

909
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,180
No.

910
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,280
Might use this.

911
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,020
Oh!

912
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,880

Okay, nice.

01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,560
Okay, so it uses my...

915
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,000
that.

916
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,000
Wait, is there still people?

917
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:56,500
Okay, I need more, I need, um, I don't have, wait, can I farm it off of these?

918
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,080
Oh, I can.

919
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,160
Oh, nice!

920
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,300
I can farm my thread off of the silk.

921
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:07,510
Okay.

922
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,570
What's my other charm?

923
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,830
They're gonna need a four-way force, amplify.

924
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:13,550
Oh, wait, no.

925
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:14,630
I already have that.

926
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,430
Who's over here?

927
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,810
Oh, it's a witch.

928
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:20,510
Burner.

929
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:21,410
Oh, it's a druid.

930
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,670
Her name's Moss, the druid.

931
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:26,430
What is it?

932
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:28,410
An intruder.

933
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,170
Terrible to interrupt.

934
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:33,430
A humble druid as they work.

935
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,810
I meant no intrusion, druid.

936
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,190
The sound of your laughter drew me to investigate.

937
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:45,130
This settlement is built around an old structure of the weavers.

938
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:46,590
Do you know of them?

939
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,310
Do they inhabit this land still?

940
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:50,370
Hmm?

941
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,070
My gentlemen!

942
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,030
What weavers?

943
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,250
You speak nonsense.

944
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,970
You're here and here.

945
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,870
So why did they send you?

946
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:03,170
Did you hear my wish?

947
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:04,910
Grant your wishes.

948
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:05,730

949
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,310

950
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,470

This is bad.

960
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,160
I think this is my first death.

961
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,800
Oh, I fucked up.

962
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,200
That's not what I was trying to do.

963
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:36,740
Oh, my God.

964
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:37,680
First death.

965
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,460
It's sun sun.

966
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,000
My rosaries!

967
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,140
My rosaries!

968
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,640
My god, I dropped all my rosaries on the floor!

969
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:50,800
Oh, it's a cocoon.

970
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,560
Oh, that's...

971
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,480
Oh, that's interesting.

972
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,560
It's a cocoon.

973
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,540
He doesn't fight me back.

974
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,380
Okay.

975
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,980
Oh my, I think the hard part is I can't dash yet.

976
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,640
That's the hard part.

977
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,640
Wait, what?

978
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,020
I wasn't even holding.

979
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:16,680
Okay.

980
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,360
Oh, what the fuck?

981
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,040
Yeah.

982
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,080
I can't pogo.

983
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,480
So I gotta be like really careful.

984
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:39,860
Bum, bum, bum.

985
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:43,840
Alright, I can dash for that.

986
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,980
I'm 1 HP and I dream right now.

987
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:49,860
I...

988
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:51,640
Okay.

989
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,580
I can do a hit there.

990
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,220
And then when he's...

991
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:56,560
slap.

992
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:57,620
Okay, nice.

993
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,960
Okay, nice.

994
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:08,450
Oh, new move.

995
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:09,150
New move.

996
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:09,910
New move.

997
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:11,610
What's that?

998
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:14,130
Oh, it's gong time.

999
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:16,270
Bum, bum, bum.

1000
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:18,270
Alright.

1001
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:20,210
New move.

1002
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:21,270
Ah!

1003
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:21,850
Shit!

1004
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,590
Jump too late.

1005
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:27,210
Jump too early.

1006
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:28,550
Okay.

1007
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:33,330
I was trying to heal, but But then I got distracted by the gongs.

1008
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,330
It was like, gong, gong.

1009
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:35,910
I can't believe.

1010
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:38,630
I saved his life and he fights back.

1011
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:41,430
I don't like the two hits.

1012
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:51,110
I think you guys might notice that when I get hit by two damage, it throws me off a lot in general.

1013
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:54,850
When it's like one hit characters, I'm fine.

1014
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:56,410
I don't know why.

1015
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:59,590
The two hits messes me up so much.

1016
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,530
Just don't get hit.

1017
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:06,310
Yeah Just don't get hit Doki.

1018
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:07,770
It's just that easy.

1019
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:09,470
Just don't get hit

1020
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:22,180
I wonder that's how much damage that does I wonder if that does that more damage than More damage than regular hit

1021
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:33,120
Because I think I think if he doesn't do two hits I could have I think I could have killed him easily when it's two.

1022
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,280
Yeah, see that?

1023
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:43,380
The fact that I can't Pogo really fucking sucks.

1024
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:47,940
Alright.

1025
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,460
Oh, one extra.

1026
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,020

That was close.

1040
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:29,690
I risked it all.

1041

01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:02,370
Okay.

1050
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,910
I'm going a little crazy.

1051
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,870
The gods are speaking to me right now.

1052
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:17,610
I am the new guy.

1053
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:20,790

Now you can start shanking, Dad.

1057
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,880
Breaking the power to regenerate silk within one shell.

1058
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:36,960
What's that?

1059
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,720
Consume the silk heart.

1060
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,000
What did I do?

1061
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,580

1062
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:44,720

1066
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,900
Oh, now you're okay with me?

1067
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:01,210

01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:04,070

1069
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:05,630

1070
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:07,130
That's right!

1071
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,410
Bad dog!

1072
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:09,990
Bad dog!

1073
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,610

1074
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:12,610
Bad!

1075
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:15,210
Now take me to the...

1076
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:17,330
Now take me to the bone bottom.

1077
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:20,550
Yeah!

1078
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:26,550
Whoa.

1079
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:27,490
Hello.

1080
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,010
Beast.

1081
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:33,270
Bees.

1082
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:34,750
Horrible beast.

1083
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:36,130
Oh.

1084
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,690
Alright, now who's a good boy?

1085
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:40,350
Who's a good boy?

1086
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:41,630
That's right.

1087
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,190
You are.

1088
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:44,470
You're a good boy.

1089
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:45,270
Yes, you are.

1090
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,110
Yes, you are!

1091
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:47,690
Yeah!

1092
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:51,750
Alright, now never fucking hit me again.

1093
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:57,150
Yippee!

1094
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:02,750
That's right.

1095
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:05,410
Alright, we go this way.

1096
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,330
Okay, now we open our own trans system.

1097
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:14,010
Can't believe he, like, fought back after I freed him.

1098
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:15,750
Okay.

1099
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:16,950
What's that?

1100
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:19,870
I just pressed that button without thinking.

1101
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,640
What do I do?

1102
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:26,940
Oh, gone!

1103
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:27,860
Gone!

1104
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:28,760
Gone!

1105
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:30,280
Gone!

1106
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,820
Oh, my chair.

1107
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,080
Oh, nice.

1108
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:40,620
Pretty fucking elaborate for a chair, but alright, I'm complaining.

1109
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,560
I like that when I die, it's a cocoon.

1110
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,920
Because it's a lot easier to handle.

1111
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,040
Versus, uh...

1112
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,600
Oh my god, I keep forgetting.

1113
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,380
I keep forgetting I can't pogo.

1114
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,200
Oh shit, it's like reflex, you know?

1115
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,080
At that point, it just feels like reflex.

1116
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,700
Krish, thank you for the five gift of ships.

1117
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,840
Thank you, thank you.

1118
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,620
I'm just so used to doing it.

1119
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:11,860
That was forget.

1120
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:14,000
Jesus Christ, these guys do.

1121
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:15,460
Alright.

1122
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:16,400
Friend!

1123
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:20,120
Wait, I actually don't know.

1124
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:21,020
know what I got.

1125
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,580
What was the move that I got?

1126
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:24,420
Wait.

1127
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,300
Control it.

1128
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:34,270
What?

1129
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:39,030
What did it give me when I went like crazy?

1130
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:41,550
What does the silk heart do?

1131
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:43,870
Did it tell me what it did?

1132
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:51,560
Oh, regen silk.

1133
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,040
Okay.

1134
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,400
Well, it's not doing it.

1135
01:23:55,080 --> 01:24:11,960
Okay, this i need it so eventually i can wall jump in the air and the water everywhere inside a shell twists inside guts tightest around heart heart pulsing rhythms sick alive dead something worse deeper must look deeper

1136
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:58,570
just one single wow one single silk oh my god you shouldn't have oh my what an honor my one silk okay my one silk regen you shouldn't have yeah I'll be very careful here like I said oh shit at least I can regen in midair that's nice I like that I like that I can regen in mid-air.

1137
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:09,450
The one thing I don't like is that it has to be a full bar of silk if I want to be able to...

1138
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,600
Oh my god.

1139
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,080
That agno move.

1140
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,480
God damn it!

1141
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:25,050
Okay.

1142
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,450
Fuen!

1143
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:33,700
Okay.

1144
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,400
I'm going down.

1145
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:37,720
Why did it take me up here?

1146
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:39,380
Hmm.

1147
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:45,420
It took me up here, but there's nothing here.

1148
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:46,820
That's weird.

1149
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,240
I'll go back and see.

1150
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:51,940
When?

1151
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:54,420
When?

1152
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:55,240
Oh!

1153
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:56,960
Okay, I see it.

1154
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:57,900
I see it.

1155
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:59,620
There's something on the top right.

1156
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:02,800
Like, a bit to the middle.

1157
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,480
I was like, where the fuck do I go?

1158
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,780
I still don't know what to do with the shards.

1159
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:16,260
And you guys were like, pick it up.

1160
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,880
But I'm like, what do I do with it?

1161
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,420
I missed it again.

1162
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:26,120
I had to land on that particular platform.

1163
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,480
Oh my god, I can't wait for my double jump or dash.

1164
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,040
I can't wait for my otter of those things.

1165
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,040
I hope I get double jump or dash.

1166
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,320
Okay.

1167
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,500
Maybe it's a nail upgrade.

1168
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:47,740
Okay, I'm just gonna look down.

1169
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:49,920
Alright, there you go.

1170
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,240
There he is.

1171
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,020
Oh, it's the new grub!

1172
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,520
What are they?

1173
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,960
Oh, they're like dogs!

1174
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:58,820
Oh!

1175
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:01,380
That's cute.

1176
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,460
They're the new grub.

1177
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,260
They're like dogflies.

1178
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,860
Wait, was there anything up here?

1179
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:12,340
No.

1180
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,800
God damn!

1181
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:14,600
I keep forgetting.

1182
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,180
No Pogo.

1183
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:16,600
No Pogo.

1184
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,740
No Pogo.

1185
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,740
There you stuff when?

1186
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:28,860
No Pogo allowed.

1187
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:34,210
I'll get used to it.

1188
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:36,250
It's not now.

1189
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:38,630
Alright, right side.

1190
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:43,010
Alright, gotta kill.

1191
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:44,430
Oh, never mind.

1192
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:45,930
Oh, can't even rob him.

1193
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:49,750
Sad.

1194
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:55,290
Can't even rob the religious zilots.

1195
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:56,370
Zilots?

1196
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,150
Is that how they pronounce it?

1197
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:02,610
What's the point?

1198
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:06,110
Can't even rob them.

1199
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:10,910
Oh, okay, that was a sick move I just did.

1200
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:11,650
Zilots?

1201
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:16,390
Yeah, he took his valuables to a goddamn grave.

1202
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:19,810
It's like, you ain't robbing me!

1203
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:21,870
The money dies with me!

1204
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:27,130
It's like when you die, you just like throw all your money into the lava or something.

1205
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:28,890
You just burn it all or some shit.

1206
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:29,710
Oh!

1207
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:31,190
The money's up top too.

1208
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:32,870
There's like shells.

1209
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:35,630
The money is...

1210
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:37,190
are the bodies of the dead bugs.

1211
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:37,650
Cool.

1212
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:41,510
Alright, this way.

1213
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:44,830
Nice.

1214
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:48,730
What's this?

1215
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:52,270
Is that one of the missions?

1216
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:53,890
The wish things?

1217
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:55,110
What is this?

1218
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:58,070
I can't open it.

1219
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:00,450
It must be something in the future.

1220
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:06,630
Yeah.

1221
01:29:06,890 --> 01:29:07,670
I'm just gonna pull a heal.

1222
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:08,570
When?

1223
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:11,130
No.

1224
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:12,310
Not Pogo.

1225
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:13,530
See?

1226
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,640
It's something I can do later on, I think.

1227
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:24,040
Yeah, because I can't activate it yet.

1228
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,120
It won't let me activate.

1229
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:32,400
So I assume that it's something in the future.

1230
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,000
Alright, right side.

1231
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:38,120
Right side, right side.

1232
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,300
Hello?

1233
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:44,840
Oh!

1234
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:49,850
I got two damage?

1235
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:51,750
Oh my god!

1236
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:55,070
Why is it all...

1237
01:29:55,090 --> 01:30:26,850
Oh my god they know they know everyone all of them are too they fucking know it's my one weakness it's literally my one weakness when they do two damage they fucking know what's the point if they all do two damage and Might as well be one HP!

1238
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:29,090
Oh my god.

1239
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:31,390
My one weakness.

1240
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:38,210
I literally don't know how to play the game when they start doing two damage on me.

1241
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:40,290
I don't know why.

1242
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:41,650
It's like a mental block.

1243
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:45,010
It's actually a mental block for me.

1244
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:53,890
Oh, oh my god, that was an accident.

1245
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:56,550
All he did was just walk forward.

1246
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:57,550
When?

1247
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:05,250
Yeah.

1248
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:07,170
I'm so sad.

1249
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:10,030
I gotta learn, but I'm so sad.

1250
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:11,670
I don't want to learn!

1251
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:15,890
What if I don't want to learn?

1252
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:19,510
That's too damn bad.

1253
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:22,990
Is

1254
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:30,050
he here?

1255
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:31,190
Yeah.

1256
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:34,690
He lives here.

1257
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:43,680
Yeah.

1258
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:44,500
Yeah.

1259
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,160
Oh my god!

1260
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,800
Oh my god!

1261
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:04,190
I think I need to have a dash for this.

1262
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:07,450
What?

1263
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:11,510
He anti, yeah.

1264
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:15,090
I'm like, how do I fight that?

1265
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:19,370
Like, I can't, I don't have dash yet.

1266
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:20,810
So I'm just like thinking.

1267
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,880
Do I need Dash for that fight?

1268
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,340
I'm like thinking, should I have Dash for it?

1269
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:41,040
I don't know if I'm like brute forcing it or anything.

1270
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:46,610
Oh, oh, wait.

1271
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:48,150
Oh, secret.

1272
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:49,630
Oh, that's cool.

1273
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:52,290
I unintentionally found the secret.

1274
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:55,470
Ow?

1275
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:57,690
Fine, I actually needed that.

1276
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:58,230
When?

1277
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:02,650
Okay, I need a...

1278
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:03,430
I'm gonna go...

1279
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:05,190
I need to go find...

1280
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:09,170
I gotta get my money back before I go back.

1281
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:16,750
I don't know if I'm brute-forcing him.

1282
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:19,090
If I need, like, other upgrades to do this.

1283
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:22,790
Okay.

1284
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:25,070
I love the cocoon thing.

1285
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:29,930
Yeah, how come I can't do...

1286
01:33:29,930 --> 01:33:30,310
Shaw!

1287
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:34,230
Okay, let's go back.

1288
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:41,080
I need to go to that little secret I found.

1289
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,100
Okay, this one.

1290
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:46,980
Okay, these...

1291
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:54,980
Oh my...

1292
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:56,780
Oh my god, he comboed me!

1293
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,000
You fucking whore!

1294
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,280
When?

1295
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:00,960
There we go.

1296
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:06,830
Okay.

1297
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,950
Spikes my fucking mortal enemy.

1298
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:15,470
I'm so scared.

1299
01:34:16,530 --> 01:34:17,350
Alright, there you go.

1300
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:20,730
Oh, it's more money.

1301
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:22,230
What's this?

1302
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:23,790
Oh no, it's a charm.

1303
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:25,570
Craft metal.

1304
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:27,050
Oh, it's now upgrade.

1305
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:31,050
We haven't found a weapon upgrade yet, though.

1306
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:35,450
Can I activate this?

1307
01:34:35,610 --> 01:34:36,730
I feel like I can.

1308
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:39,990
I need a.

1309
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:44,250
Is it need a?

1310
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:48,150
Oh, there's a...

1311
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:49,530
Oh, there's a bench down there?

1312
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:50,390
Okay, I'll go there.

1313
01:34:58,390 --> 01:34:58,950
Pogo stick?

1314
01:34:59,050 --> 01:35:00,430
I have to do this?

1315
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:01,950
No way.

1316
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:04,930
Oh, there is a bench.

1317
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:06,850
Never mind.

1318
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:08,030
Is that bench?

1319
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:09,670
What is that?

1320
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:12,870
Oh, it is.

1321
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:13,950
Wait, what is this?

1322
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:15,830
Oh, it is.

1323
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:23,780
Hello?

1324
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,860
What is here?

1325
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:29,300
Alright, we'll try.

1326
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:31,520
Oh.

1327
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:34,180
Oh, they live up top.

1328
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:36,620
Hello?

1329
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:37,880
Oh, hi.

1330
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,420
Get out of here.

1331
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:42,940
This one's a little light theory worth a lifelong sentence.

1332
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,680
Oh, try to steal.

1333
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:48,780
Oh, this area is locked, though.

1334
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,140
It's like a jail.

1335
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,640
It's like a little jail.

1336
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,900
I wonder how I can unlock it later.

1337
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,100
Where am I?

1338
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:00,740
This way.

1339
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:06,700
Yeah, it's a little dungeon.

1340
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,080
Yeah, that's on him for getting caught.

1341
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:12,760
Should have gotten caught then.

1342
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:15,000
Alright, this is gonna...

1343
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,220
Okay.

1344
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:17,860
Oh my god.

1345
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:19,020
Okay, when he jumps...

1346
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,900
What the fuck?

1347
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:25,780
Okay.

1348
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,120
I'm like...

1349
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:33,680
Oh my god.

1350
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:40,920
I have to be like...

1351
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:41,960
Oh my god.

1352
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:43,440
I...

1353
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,720
Yeah, Dash would be really nice for this area.

1354
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,420
Okay, I gotta stay cool.

1355
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,860
The thing is, I don't know if I'm pre-forcing him or not.

1356
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:56,100
Because if I had a dash, this would be so much easier.

1357
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:58,060
100%.

1358
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:01,420
No.

1359
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:06,470
Okay.

1360
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:08,710
Alright.

1361
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:11,150
I think I got the pattern up.

1362
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:16,710
Oh.

1363
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:19,250
Okay.

1364
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:20,670
When he does his swing.

1365
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:22,350
His jump.

1366
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:23,030
His jump.

1367
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:24,010
Yeah.

1368
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:27,030
His jump is like what's fucking with me.

1369
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:31,990
trying to figure out the pattern of when he's gonna jump

1370
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:46,420
oh it is doable it's very hard i i have no idea if i'm brute forcing that's the thing

1371
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,240
okay oh

1372
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:40,680
ah i keep thinking i need to know what he does what he does uh when he's like uh when what what is the telltale sign when he's gonna jump i'm like i figure out his swing his swing i just pogo him but like when does he jump like that when does he do that oh my god he's just okay

1373
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:56,680
Okay.

1374
01:38:59,300 --> 01:38:59,680
Oh.

1375
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:01,060
See?

1376
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:02,520
I can't tell.

1377
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:04,940
I can't tell.

1378
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:11,320
I can't tell when he does the jumpy move.

1379
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:19,880
He crouches.

1380
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:20,220
Okay.

1381
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:27,520
Oh my god.

1382
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:29,740
Oh.

1383
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:32,120
This boss.

1384
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,120
This boss is very annoying.

1385
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:35,260
When?

1386
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,440
Squat equals jump or what?

1387
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:52,260
Okay, he poses what completely is not going to jump, but you do the double dash slash.

1388
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:54,960
When he poses it back completely.

1389
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:56,460
Holy fuck.

1390
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:57,980
This one's hard.

1391
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:00,680
I think it would...

1392
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:04,380
Definitely with dash, he would be like the easiest boss ever.

1393
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:07,380
Because I'm like, I really want to dash, you know?

1394
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:12,040
Okay.

1395
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:38,340

1396
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:52,970

1397
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:58,660
is like this is definitely the filter boss

1398
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:13,310

1401
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:48,880
I don't know the distance for this.

1402
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,580
I don't know the distance.

1403
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,260
Okay, we're gonna...

1404
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:04,680
We're gonna grab our stuff.

1405
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,280
I can't believe...

1406
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,140
I spent so long.

1407
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,040
I actually brute-forced that boss.

1408
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,680
I wasn't supposed to be here.

1409
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,200
There's no way I was supposed to get to the...

1410
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,440
Go to the other map by now.

1411
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,360
I don't think I... I don't know.

1412
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:17,300
I feel like...

1413
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:23,680
I feel like I brute-forced it because all the little minions are so strong.

1414
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,560
They're all so fucking tanky.

1415
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,380
So I feel like...

1416
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,340
I feel like...

1417
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:38,100
I was not meant to be here yet.

1418
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:41,600
There you go.

1419
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:44,560
It's easier to go up than it is to go down.

1420
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:50,900
That's for sure.

1421
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,320
I'm going.

1422
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:51,920
I'm leaving.

1423
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:56,440
Don't worry.

1424
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:59,140
Back to Sun by Fire will make you stronger.

1425
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,280
I'm leaving.

1426
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:04,500
One.

1427
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,340
Yeah, they're too tanky.

1428
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:08,220
I don't like it.

1429
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,900
Corrin, thank you for the super chat.

1430
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:12,900
Thank you, thank you.

1431
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:18,000
I want to grab all the Upgrades first.

1432
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,020

Okay.

01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:27,860
So many spikes everywhere.

1436
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:32,360
Like this entire town is literally just goddamn spikes.

1437
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,660
I swear to God.

01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:35,480

When?

1441
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:49,440
This entire...

1442
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:55,740
area is literally just spikes it's nothing else it's just it's a spiky spike world

1445
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:34,800
I don't know where I'm gonna go so I don't want to pogo

1448
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,840
Wishing you love loads of fun with Silksong.

1449
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,960
I'll now attempt to fight the first boss.

1450
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,800
The same story page myself.

1451
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,000

1452
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,760

1453
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,360

Is it actually still down?

1457
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,160
It is!

1458
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:19,420

I can't buy so song yet, too.

1462
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:34,140
You guys gotta live vicariously through me right now.

1463
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:37,940
Yeah.

1464
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,680
Wait, there is a little secret in there.

1465
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:47,280
Okay.

1466
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,900
Oh, okay, it was nothing.

1467
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,080
The secret was nothing.

1468
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:59,170
Guys, now that you know the secret is nothing you don't have to go here oh she's here

1469
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:29,620
child wielding needle what do you make of this huge groaning structure the skill of all impresses me if this is merely an outpost of the citadel above then a cat hole must be grand beyond measure yokada perhaps so you must have pried is indeed the work done here to build something so vast and such a dangerous place.

1470
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,080
Alright, gotta buy another map.

1471
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:32,920
Bellways.

1472
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:35,640
Oh, that's the fast travel.

1473
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,740
Okay, let's buy this first.

1474
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:41,920

01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,920
Fuck yeah, we have enough money anyway.

1477
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,660
The checkout is the problem.

1478
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:52,440
Yeah, the checkout is the problem.

1479
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:53,520
I can literally call it checkout.

1480
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:58,140
Oh my god, where am I?

1481
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:02,320
Do I go here first or do I explore everything?

1482
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:03,840
Do I explore this area?

1483
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:06,880
Explore everything.

1484
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,420
Official, thank you for the super chat.

1485
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:09,880
Thank you, thank you.

1486
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:14,700
I'm like debating if I should keep going here or explore.

1487
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:16,980
I'll explore back.

1488
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:19,960
I'll go back to the last area and explore it a little bit more.

1489
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:23,620
I need to use the bathroom now.

1490
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:24,620
Listen to her sing.

1491
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:25,100
Oh, wait.

1492
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:26,760
I'll go further back.

1493
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,540
Wait, I'll reset her.

1494
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:35,120
Listen to her sing.

1495
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:36,320
I gotta use the bathroom.

1496
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,400
Oh

1497
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:46,720

01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,040
I'm back.

1501
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,080
I got myself some cough drops too

1502
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:16,340
Like oh and hey guys, thank you for the super chat.

1503

01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:17,280
Thank you.

1505
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:17,520
Thank you.

1506
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:21,660
Shalom Bring your eye.

1507
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:23,500
Oh,

1508
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:37,820
I go back.

1509
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:40,700
I'm done singing with her.

1510
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:46,200
I'm harmonizing with her.

1511
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:50,460
Oh, there's the tram.

1512
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:52,880
Oh, I'm broke.

1513
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:57,880
She took all my money.

1514
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,640
She actually took all my money.

1515
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:04,640
Ooh, cello.

1516
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,820
She took it up.

1517
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:12,860
Okay, I gotta kill these guys for money, I think.

1518
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:14,340
Where are they?

1519
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:18,560
I won't get the tram system so I can go home.

1520
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:20,560
I won't upgrade my net.

1521
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:23,740
There must be a way to upgrade my nail, I feel like.

1522
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:28,500
Oh my gosh.

1523
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,200
Oh, yeah.

1524
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:37,340
Ornita.

1525
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:38,500
Mynita.

1526
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:41,040
That's what I mean.

1527
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:43,580
Oh my god.

1528
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:44,600
Fly down!

1529
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,460
Yeah.

1530
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:46,860
Oh my god.

1531
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,020
And then it falls into lava.

1532
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:49,300
Oh, now I'm falling.

1533
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:50,840
Oh, it does two damage.

1534
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:53,840
That's two damage!

1535
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,440
I swear to God!

1536
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:05,100
I swear they all do two damage.

1537
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:07,460
Lava is hot.

1538
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,560
Why do they all do two damage?

1539
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:19,680
Oh, chalon!

1540
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,620
Oh, chalon!

1541
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:27,280
Ah, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la- The song is actually stuck here.

1542
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:28,420
Where?

1543
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:29,620
Oh, shit.

1544
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:32,540
Nice.

1545
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:35,940
And now I'm back, yeah.

1546
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:42,380
Let's just explore as much as we can for one area where we move on.

1547
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:46,540
I wanna upgrade my nail!

1548
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:52,380
Ooh, let's see this guy, la-la-la-la-la-la-y-la-y.

1549
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,620
Ooh, cello.

1550
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:56,600
Ooh, cello.

1551
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:57,800
When?

1552
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:01,680
Oh, I have maximum amount of charts.

1553
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:04,440
That's a thing?

1554
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:08,320
Wait, who are you?

1555
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:14,080
Aha, aha, a native of these far-e-low-land approaches.

1556
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:16,060
Have no fear, my friend.

1557
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:18,520
We fleas are but humble travelers.

1558
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,320
Oh, the fleas are nomads.

1559
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:21,340
Oh, that's funny.

1560
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:25,100
just like traveling around on other animals.

1561
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:28,700
Yeah, well, Metzer.

1562
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:31,200
So, like you, I'm not of these lands.

1563
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:32,760
I'm merely journeying through.

1564
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:35,220
A kindred spirit?

1565
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:38,680
It's good luck for wanderers to meet on an unfamiliar path.

1566
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:45,260
And now that we have met, know that I am flea master, Mushka, leader of this cavern.

1567
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:47,000
Wait, they're Russian too?

1568
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:48,100
Mushka?

1569
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,080
The fleas are Russian?

1570
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:57,380
Our own journey has barely begun, but you're most welcome to tear here a while, stranger.

1571
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:02,620
Where waves are dark and winding, good bugs must stay close together.

1572
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:04,160
Oh, there they are!

1573
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:05,080
There's the doggos!

1574
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:13,020
Do the Shinn, do Shinnah, do Shinnah, I am saying welcome to your caravan, stranger.

1575
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,260
You're very, very funny, very strange flea, isn't it?

1576
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,380
No fur at all?

1577
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,080
And your wings fell off.

1578
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:26,480
are ours just jest of course us please famous forgiving jokes

1579
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:54,360

1580
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:19,360

1581
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:21,480
Wait, they're children?

1582
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,240
Not even dogs.

1583
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:30,060
Could you help us find these poor lost fleas?

1584
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:34,960
We didn't continue our journey until some of these poor deers have found a way here to us.

1585
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:36,540
Oh my god!

1586
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,440
They're not even...

1587
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:40,860
I thought they were your pets!

1588
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:41,580
I'm sorry.

1589
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,740
I didn't realize they were your children.

1590
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,600
Paragost?

1591
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:51,460
I don't understand you rightly, stranger.

1592
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:54,580
You will help gather the lonely fleas to the caravan.

1593
01:58:55,620 --> 01:59:00,260
Truly, I am traveling these lands for my own reasons, flea master.

1594
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:06,020
However, if I happen upon any fleas on my travel, I will aid them the best I can.

1595
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,860
Oh, I could ask for nothing more.

1596
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:13,400
They must all be hiding or stuck in dangerous places.

1597
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:18,120
But if you rouse them, they're sure to find their way here to us.

1598
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:46,300
may the kingdom bless your travels and keep you safe stranger you're welcome the rest of us whenever the roads bring you back oh look the poor fleas are starting to make their way to us what a precious thing we have much to thank you for already and I hope we will have even more than thankful for very soon please keep seeking out our lost fellows oh I can't I didn't realize they were their children.

1599
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:48,580
They act so dog-like.

1600
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:54,160
They barked too.

1601
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:55,160
Oh shit.

1602
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:58,480
Like how was I supposed to know they were kids?

1603
01:59:58,680 --> 01:59:59,900
They barked.

1604
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:02,080
I don't even get paid.

1605
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,960
They are wandering nomads.

1606
02:00:09,290 --> 02:00:11,810
I can't believe they were kids all along.

1607
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:14,810
Yeah they look like puppies.

1608
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:17,110
I go I go.

1609
02:00:17,130 --> 02:01:08,920
up all right where's the tram okay we're going to tram and see if there's like upgrades or anything it's like i've maxed shards now so i'm like i feel like i'm i can upgrade or like there's something i can do with them so i don't have to like you know so i don't have to like waste my time can't like not having to carry more toddlers and dogs are so if you say that to a parent they'll fucking punch you the dog okay dog owners would be like yeah they're like my children it helps but then it like an actual parent would be like did you compare my child to a fucking dog all right oh my god he sounds like chubaka do you guys hear that watch

1610
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:14,680
He like Chewbacca'd me.

1611
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:15,980
Did you guys hear that?

1612
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:18,120
Yeah!

1613
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:18,920
He's like...

1614
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:21,180
That's Chewbacca.

1615
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:25,300
That's rude to the dog.

1616
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:29,080
Alright, let's see.

1617
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,040
My butt really hurts.

1618
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:33,780
Good night, Toki.

1619
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:35,720
Yeah, I mean, thank you for the super chat.

1620
02:01:35,820 --> 02:01:36,100
Thank you, thank you.

1621
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:37,760
Why does your butt hurt?

1622
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:39,580
Oh, traveler.

1623
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:46,120
trade with an old pilgrim, surely something here will aid you in your great journey.

1624
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:53,800
I'm sorry, the big buggy mommy extorted me of all my rosaries.

1625
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,560
Oh, back again?

1626
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:01,680
The wish well is up, ready for all the poor souls who've been left behind down here.

1627
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:07,580
In Vardu, wishes are granted to those truly devout, or so they say.

1628
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:10,540
And there ain't no harm in us dregs having wishes too.

1629
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:11,680
Why?

1630
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:15,460
I even went and added a little wish of my own to the wish wall.

1631
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:16,720
Fair's fair.

1632
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:18,780
I did build a thing.

1633
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:22,940
Seems like the kingdom should be granting my wish before anyone else.

1634
02:02:23,620 --> 02:02:25,060
Alright, what is the wish wall?

1635
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:27,140
Oh!

1636
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,320
I mean, I fucking already have a lot.

1637
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:32,340
I donated.

1638
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:35,640
Bone bottom repairs.

1639
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:36,960
Wish granted.

1640
02:02:40,750 --> 02:02:42,430
Those men who hunt...

1641
02:02:42,490 --> 02:02:45,210
We could make use of the shawls and falling.

1642
02:02:46,490 --> 02:02:47,530
How do I do this?

1643
02:02:48,190 --> 02:02:50,070
Garb of the Pilgrims.

1644
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:55,610
How do I do this wish?

1645
02:02:59,300 --> 02:02:59,860
Oh!

1646
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:03,340
It's those guys.

1647
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,360
Okay, I see.

1648
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:07,740
Oh, hey!

1649
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:08,800
There she is!

1650
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:11,380
We're in Aramis.

1651
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:13,740
The watchfuls never ever seen such a part.

1652
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:16,160
They're religious, Shaka.

1653
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:17,920
They're like, they're a cult.

1654
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:19,460
They believe in peace and love.

1655
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,240
Oh, they're hippies.

1656
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:27,160
It's such a poorly defended encampment.

1657
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:28,800
It's like those hippie camps.

1658
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:33,600
Peace and, yeah, they don't believe in violence.

1659
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:41,340
The pilgrims here seem to have no mind for war, Shaka.

1660
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:43,940
I suspect most depart for this little story.

1661
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:46,480
soon after they arrive them.

1662
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:50,120
And they persist in their carelessness.

1663
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:53,220
They will only find death in these harsh lands.

1664
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:55,340
Oh my god.

1665
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:58,740
They're fucking hippies.

1666
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:04,080
Oh, this is a tram station.

1667
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:06,140
I knew it.

1668
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:07,860
I knew it.

1669
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:12,100
Good bow.

1670
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:13,680
The lands around turning deadly.

1671
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:15,580
I worry for its safety.

1672
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:18,580
We surely aren't seen its finest moment.

1673
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:22,740
But this place has been serving us passing bugs for as long as I can remember.

1674
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:24,580
It's faith, you see.

1675
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:29,100
All those pilgrims, now and past, our devotion holds it together.

1676
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:32,260
The camp remain and provide no matter the troubles.

1677
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:33,840
Alright, remember when...

1678
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,760
Okay, so we have to kill the pilgrims.

1679
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:39,880
And you know where they are in my favorite spot.

1680
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,940
Don't worry, Sharka.

1681
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:45,560
Sharka will defend them.

1682
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:47,580
Wake up!

1683
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:52,670
Oh, jeez, cool.

1684
02:04:52,990 --> 02:04:55,390
Those civilians are unharmed.

1685
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:01,350
It's Pilgrim Farming Time.

1686
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:04,410
Let's gotta remember where they are.

1687
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:07,150
This way.

1688
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:13,190
I remember where you all live, pilgrims.

1689
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:15,330
I remember.

1690
02:05:17,650 --> 02:05:18,690
Yeah, it's two of the left.

1691
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:22,530
They thought the nightmare was over.

1692
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:29,230
Oh, it was over.

1693
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:31,350
Oh, shit.

1694
02:05:31,730 --> 02:05:32,290
For that.

1695
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:32,890
Oh, my God.

1696
02:05:33,130 --> 02:05:33,830
He learned.

1697
02:05:36,890 --> 02:05:37,430
Joink.

1698
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:38,850
My cloth now.

1699
02:05:39,070 --> 02:05:39,770
Okay, I need 12.

1700
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:44,190
That's like six times a refresh.

1701
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:47,630
He was like, I'm not.

1702
02:05:47,650 --> 02:06:48,070

1703
02:06:51,470 --> 02:06:51,690
Alright.

1704
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:53,450
Yoink.

1705
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:56,010
She's a menace.

1706
02:06:56,830 --> 02:06:56,910
Yoink.

1707
02:06:57,050 --> 02:06:59,590
And I'm like farming money too.

1708
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:03,930
Why are we...

1709
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:05,810
It's because they're crazy.

1710
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:10,130
I mean, it's a little...

1711
02:07:10,130 --> 02:07:14,590
Okay, it's a bad that I'm stealing from the mentally ill.

1712
02:07:14,930 --> 02:07:17,350
But like, it's part of the mission!

1713
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,330
The other pilgrims told me to do it.

1714
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:23,130
I'm doing as I'm doing as I told.

1715
02:07:24,130 --> 02:07:26,310
A good soldier follows orders.

1716
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:34,530
I'm just doing as I'm told.

1717
02:07:35,150 --> 02:07:36,710
It was a wish, okay?

1718
02:07:36,950 --> 02:07:39,750
I am granting a wish right now.

1719
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:42,510
It's a make a wish.

1720
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:44,670
They asked me to...

1721
02:07:44,670 --> 02:07:47,610
They asked me to strip them of their grave.

1722
02:07:47,630 --> 02:07:49,570
in the make-a-wish.

1723
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:55,650
They're doing my part.

1724
02:07:57,070 --> 02:07:58,310
Look, look, see?

1725
02:07:58,730 --> 02:08:00,370
I promised someone.

1726
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:05,170
I'm fulfilling a make-a-wish.

1727
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:08,190
They requested this in the make-a-wish well.

1728
02:08:11,010 --> 02:08:12,630
But it's a ride.

1729
02:08:13,830 --> 02:08:16,110
Well, maybe they shouldn't have wished it.

1730
02:08:19,190 --> 02:08:23,310
Is it truly my fault when I'm only fulfilling a make-a-wish?

1731
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:28,930
See, from the mentally, if gotcha game, those can do it so can you.

1732
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:30,650
Oh, Steve, thank you for the super chat.

1733
02:08:30,710 --> 02:08:31,110
Thank you.

1734
02:08:31,210 --> 02:08:32,190
Thank you.

1735
02:08:35,190 --> 02:08:39,890
If anything, I wonder, like, what are the limitations of make-a-wishes?

1736
02:08:43,210 --> 02:08:44,650
What's the limitations?

1737
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:46,930
See, wish granted.

1738
02:08:47,630 --> 02:09:18,530

Yeah, it's never a war crime in the first time.

1740
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:27,230
Sorry, crappy.

1741
02:09:27,410 --> 02:09:29,750
Sad crap that you was super chat thinking, thank you.

1742
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:36,290
That's a fucked up kid.

1743
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:39,990
The kid is dying.

1744
02:09:40,530 --> 02:09:42,290
I'm fulfilling their wish.

1745
02:09:42,710 --> 02:09:43,950
How dare you?

1746
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:47,370
That child was dying.

1747
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:49,770
I'm just fulfilling it.

1748
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:52,850
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

1749
02:09:53,150 --> 02:09:54,090
Thank you.

1750
02:09:54,430 --> 02:09:57,090
Oh, man.

1751
02:09:57,270 --> 02:09:58,450
I can't wait to get Dash.

1752
02:10:00,770 --> 02:10:01,730
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

1753
02:10:01,810 --> 02:10:02,050
Thank you.

1754
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:02,590
Thank you.

1755
02:10:02,690 --> 02:10:03,690
Obey first.

1756
02:10:03,890 --> 02:10:04,990
Complain later.

1757
02:10:05,710 --> 02:10:06,370
Let me go up.

1758
02:10:08,170 --> 02:10:08,650
Exactly.

1759
02:10:08,850 --> 02:10:11,550
How can you say no to a sick child?

1760
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:13,510
What's wrong with you?

1761
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:23,260
I'm just gonna... I'm killing him just because I can't.

1762
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:27,960
Yeah.

1763
02:10:31,530 --> 02:10:32,870
Alright, where else should I go?

1764
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:33,870
Okay, we go up.

1765
02:10:41,630 --> 02:10:43,590
Okay, let's practice this.

1766
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:45,930
Okay.

1767
02:10:49,030 --> 02:10:50,350
It's so weird.

1768
02:10:53,070 --> 02:10:57,790
I need to, like, have it more ingrained in my head for these Pogo's.

1769
02:10:58,510 --> 02:11:00,190
For the dash Pogo's?

1770
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:02,150
Such a weird Pogo.

1771
02:11:04,390 --> 02:11:07,570
I had to, like, unlearn the other Pogo for this.

1772
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:12,090
Okay.

1773
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:13,570
Money!

1774
02:11:13,970 --> 02:11:14,570
Oh, shortcut!

1775
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:16,530
Nice.

1776
02:11:19,210 --> 02:11:20,570
Are you serious?

1777
02:11:20,890 --> 02:11:21,250
Okay.

1778
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:24,630
Mmm.

1779
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:27,710
Okay, I wonder if I can...

1780
02:11:27,710 --> 02:11:28,190
No.

1781
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:30,290
I was gonna say if I can...

1782
02:11:30,290 --> 02:11:31,930
That's the hard part.

1783
02:11:32,410 --> 02:11:33,210
I don't...

1784
02:11:33,210 --> 02:11:33,790
The ring.

1785
02:11:33,810 --> 02:11:35,910
of this is the hard part.

1786
02:11:41,670 --> 02:11:46,470
Because when you lose your groove, it fucks you up.

1787
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:48,810
Because it's a...

1788
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:50,190
I think that's the hard part.

1789
02:11:50,410 --> 02:11:55,350
When you lose your first dash, it gets a lot harder.

1790
02:11:57,510 --> 02:11:59,850
It's easier when you're closer, I think.

1791
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:03,270
When you're closer to the...

1792
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:04,970
Like, you just have to be...

1793
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:06,010
Ah, see like that!

1794
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:06,910
It's...

1795
02:12:08,410 --> 02:12:09,050
Yeah.

1796
02:12:09,690 --> 02:12:10,930
It's harder to recover.

1797
02:12:12,010 --> 02:12:12,250
Yeah.

1798
02:12:13,610 --> 02:12:16,550
It's very hard to recover when you miss the first one.

1799
02:12:20,930 --> 02:12:23,210
I think I'm gonna die for this.

1800
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:25,830
Yeah, like...

1801
02:12:26,790 --> 02:12:28,070
It's so...

1802
02:12:28,070 --> 02:12:29,590
It's such a weird Pogo.

1803
02:12:32,190 --> 02:12:34,050
Okay, I gotta grab my cocoon.

1804
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:39,620
It's definitely a skill check.

1805
02:12:43,410 --> 02:12:49,230
It's easier when you're like up like super close to it, which I've noticed.

1806
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:57,640
I'm still trying to develop the muscle memory for how close I have to be.

1807
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:05,120
Shaw!

1808
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:07,900
Akitas!

1809
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:11,280
Yeah.

1810
02:13:19,590 --> 02:13:19,870
Okay.

1811
02:13:21,370 --> 02:13:22,790
Gotta get that temple going.

1812
02:13:23,750 --> 02:13:25,910
I like the little flip she does, though.

1813
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:26,730
It's really cute.

1814
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:29,890
Oh my god, my cocoon is so far.

1815
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:37,690
Yeah.

1816
02:13:39,870 --> 02:13:41,890
Ah, going back is difficult.

1817
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:44,830
Oh my god, are you serious?

1818
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:53,590
I don't like going back.

1819
02:13:54,410 --> 02:13:55,990
Going back is hard to do.

1820
02:13:58,750 --> 02:13:59,710
Holy shit.

1821
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:01,370
Friend!

1822
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:02,910
Alright, this way.

1823
02:14:09,610 --> 02:14:10,610
Wait, what's that?

1824
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:11,610
Oh, shit.

1825
02:14:11,770 --> 02:14:12,650
Wait, what the fuck?

1826
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:15,430
I didn't realize there was something there.

1827
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:18,370
Oh.

1828
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:21,690
Oh?

1829
02:14:25,490 --> 02:14:26,670
There's no maps here.

1830
02:14:26,710 --> 02:14:28,610
Oh, that's all my money.

1831
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:30,970
Is that it?

1832
02:14:32,530 --> 02:14:35,070
There's a fucking map for this one room?

1833
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:37,810
Okay, don't you hate it when you're money just rolls away?

1834
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:42,650
My money literally just rolled away.

1835
02:14:44,110 --> 02:14:45,930
Would you fucking hate it when that happens?

1836
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:54,180
There's someone, there's a, oh.

1837
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,960
Super goddamn rosary currency.

1838
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:02,720
It literally rolled away from me.

1839
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:05,820
I don't know which way to go.

1840
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,740
Okay, I can't do that.

1841
02:15:14,510 --> 02:15:15,350
All right, guys.

1842
02:15:15,710 --> 02:16:08,950

ROW!

1845
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:27,200
Reving up the docks.

1846
02:16:31,110 --> 02:16:32,530
Down out goal.

1847
02:16:41,630 --> 02:16:42,910
Okay, this way.

1848
02:16:44,510 --> 02:16:46,010
We go up here.

1849
02:16:50,290 --> 02:16:51,770
Alright, nice.

1850
02:16:53,310 --> 02:16:53,910
What's this?

1851
02:16:54,450 --> 02:16:55,190
Can I hit this?

1852
02:16:55,350 --> 02:16:55,630

1855
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:35,700
My dash was my crutch.

1856
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:37,700
I'm a dash crutcher.

1857
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:47,900
Oh, my god.

1858
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:49,820
When?

1859
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:55,650
Yeah, fuck you.

1860
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:56,870

1862
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:00,030
What is he doing?

1863
02:18:00,350 --> 02:18:01,250
Mining the clothes?

1864
02:18:02,970 --> 02:18:04,890
Does he yearn for the mines?

1865
02:18:05,050 --> 02:18:05,770
Wait, what's this?

1866
02:18:05,990 --> 02:18:06,750
Oh, my god.

1867
02:18:07,750 --> 02:18:09,650
Oh my god, they're the new jumpies.

1868
02:18:11,150 --> 02:18:12,290
Oh, I don't like the sound.

1869
02:18:12,890 --> 02:18:14,090
The sound they make.

1870
02:18:14,690 --> 02:18:15,850
That's so unselling.

1871
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:17,630
They remind me...

1872
02:18:17,630 --> 02:18:18,990
Yeah, they remind me of clickers.

1873
02:18:19,250 --> 02:18:21,870
That's why I was like, what does this remind me of?

1874
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:23,350
Like, their sound effect.

1875
02:18:23,510 --> 02:18:24,790
They sound like clickers.

1876
02:18:27,570 --> 02:18:28,370
A pony!

1877
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:33,670
They look more like...

1878
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:34,650
Like dinos.

1879
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:37,170

02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:30,820
Yeah.

1886
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:33,920
We will go this way.

1887
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:35,020
Whoops.

1888
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:37,080
I hate these ants.

1889
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:38,960
They're so fucking tanky.

1890
02:20:40,120 --> 02:20:44,740
I feel like... I just feel like I'm not supposed to kill them yet.

1891
02:20:45,060 --> 02:20:47,300
I'm not supposed to be in that area yet.

1892
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:50,560
Friend!

1893
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:52,240

Alright.

1896
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:30,290
Oh, shit.

1897
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:36,130
We go left side.

1898
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:43,980
The floor is lava, but I can just jump it, apparently.

1899
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:45,740
I have nerve.

1900
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:48,940
Apparently my feet has nerve damage, so it doesn't matter.

1901
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:50,620
Which is fine.

1902
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:56,080
Don't you love it when your feet has nerve damage, guys?

When?

1904
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:07,560
It's fine.

1905
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:08,600
I don't care that much.

1906
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:12,000
Alright, we go down.

1907
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,400
Down and Tudor, right?

1908
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:20,860
Okay, what I will say, I like that Shakira.

1909
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:22,840
Sorry, what was her name?

1910
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,800
She's like Shakira to me.

1911

1914
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:11,360
I like that she's babying me.

1915
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:16,420
That makes me happy that she's babying me.

1916
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:20,380
Okay, we'll go to the right.

1917
02:23:30,310 --> 02:23:32,130
She knows I need help.

1918
02:23:33,410 --> 02:23:33,970
I did?

1919
02:23:34,430 --> 02:23:35,010
No, I didn't.

1920
02:23:35,110 --> 02:23:36,090
I went to that area.

1921
02:23:37,170 --> 02:23:39,510
I can't go up top because it's locked.

1922
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:41,410
Yes, it's better.

1923
02:23:41,510 --> 02:23:47,730
Not only is she a big buggy mommy, she actually is helping me.

1924
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:51,170
She actually is useful.

1925
02:23:53,390 --> 02:23:55,090
Unlike a goddamn nerd.

1926
02:23:58,330 --> 02:23:59,130
Wait, what?

1927
02:24:00,190 --> 02:24:23,630

There's the bell tollo.

02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:41,200
Okay, I want to know how strong this is.

1931
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:45,200
Alright, it's that strong.

1932
02:24:47,940 --> 02:24:48,360
Whoa!

1933
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:50,580
That guy's new.

1934
02:24:52,060 --> 02:24:53,420
I did not expect him.

1935
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:56,320
Whoops.

1936
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:03,080
I feel like I have a lot of range in general.

1937
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:07,760

Um...

1941
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:45,960
Do I have...

1942
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:49,320
Anything that I can?

1943
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:50,260
Okay, no.

1944
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:53,000
I guess I'll go right side.

1945
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,360
See what I'm missing.

1946
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:55,720
Oh!

1947
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:56,240
Oh!

1948
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:56,900
Upgrade!

1949
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:00,720
Oh my god, he's so... Look at his tiny hands.

1950
02:26:02,060 --> 02:26:03,400
Oh my god.

1951
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:04,320
Oh.

1952
02:26:04,980 --> 02:26:06,280
Oh, Forge Daughter.

1953
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:07,280
Oh.

1954
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:09,240
Ah, Twinkie Bug.

1955
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:12,320
Why do you bother us that I awake?

1956
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:15,780
The sound of your craft called me to investigate.

1957
02:26:16,380 --> 02:26:17,360
What is your duty here?

1958
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:18,960
Are you a smith of some kind?

1959
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:21,220
A smith?

1960
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:23,080
Hardly so cruel.

1961
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:25,320
We are forged daughter.

1962
02:26:25,740 --> 02:26:28,300
How can a boining bug not tell?

1963
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:32,820
Ours is the ancient line and honor rule.

1964
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:37,100
These dogs and lambs around are fortunate to have our skill.

1965
02:26:38,280 --> 02:27:09,460
If you are talented as you say, suggest would you leave me your aid i've lacked for my usual tools and i suspect you could craft five replacements look it's like the gap mowing big big strong uh uh forger with her tiny tools that is her voice now blades and traps imagine that's your forge master you're like i'm gonna make you a big old sword

1966

02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:25,240
The babush...

1968
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:28,200
The babushbushmiss.

1969
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:32,680
No doubt, we know you are, Ty.

1970
02:27:33,080 --> 02:27:33,620
Has been?

1971
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:36,920
Of sorts, but may be strange to this land.

1972
02:27:37,460 --> 02:27:40,160
Some would likely prove fine challenge for your crab.

1973
02:27:41,960 --> 02:28:12,880
then we'll construct them but you'll provide the materials and compensation for our time okay okay let's know what can we clap big bug baby voice yeah you know he's what is that sing shard a vicious stabbing trap the words and he's the workers She's down there,

1974

02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:15,900
Oh, it means I can swim, right?

1976
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:23,620
What the fuck do I buy?

1977
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:27,360
What?

1978
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:32,660
It's so hard to figure out.

1979
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:35,540
Because, like, no one knows.

1980
02:28:36,460 --> 02:28:38,640
It's the worst part of Pavilion launch day.

1981
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:39,840
No one knows.

1982
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:42,400
I assume the crafting kit because it's expensive.

1983
02:28:45,820 --> 02:28:47,020
A fair exchange.

1984
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:50,160
Affair, change me, pointy bug.

1985
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:52,340
Now I'll work cause.

1986
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:56,340
Return again if you find need of our trade and talent.

1987
02:28:58,220 --> 02:28:59,880
What the fuck did I buy?

1988
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:06,040
What?

1989
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:08,340
It's just a pouch?

1990
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:09,500
Oh my god.

1991
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:11,300
I just bought a bag.

1992
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:15,340
If you need something, talk to the boss.

1993
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:16,120
I'm busy.

1994
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:18,560
I literally, I just bought a fucking bag.

1995
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:21,060
Nice.

1996
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,020
This bag better be like from Gucci or something.

1997
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:29,520
I bought an upgrade for something I don't have.

1998
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:30,900
I swear to God.

1999
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:34,080
This bag better be from fucking Gucci Baguchi.

2000
02:29:35,440 --> 02:29:37,520
It's a nice bag.

2001
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:43,660
I can't even do anything with it.

2002
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:45,680
Oh buggy.

2003
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:47,840
Yeah, it better be like buggy bag.

2004
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:49,020
I swear to God.

2005
02:29:54,070 --> 02:29:54,870
What's this?

2006
02:29:55,270 --> 02:29:56,570
Oh, I don't think they carry...

2007
02:29:56,570 --> 02:29:59,410
Oh, I don't think they carry rosaries.

2008
02:29:59,570 --> 02:30:00,810
They don't look religious.

2009
02:30:04,830 --> 02:30:08,130
This land doesn't look religious, guys.

2010
02:30:08,430 --> 02:30:09,170
I can't tell.

2011
02:30:13,070 --> 02:30:17,170
Oh, you can throw to the side?

2012
02:30:17,650 --> 02:30:19,770
I thought it was... Oh, I can... Oh, I can hit it.

2013
02:30:19,830 --> 02:30:20,270
That's good.

2014
02:30:24,690 --> 02:30:25,390
That's good.

2015
02:30:25,510 --> 02:30:26,890
Wait, I'm killing her workers.

2016
02:30:27,210 --> 02:30:28,350
Shh, don't tell her.

2017
02:30:29,730 --> 02:30:30,730
Don't tell her.

2018
02:30:30,850 --> 02:30:32,230
I'm literally... Ow!

2019
02:30:32,950 --> 02:30:34,330
What the fuck?

2020
02:30:34,490 --> 02:30:37,530
She does... Why do they all do two damage?

2021
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:45,010
I swear they all do plus two now.

2022
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:51,520
Okay.

2023
02:30:55,820 --> 02:30:57,800
I mean, sure.

2024
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:00,920
Wait, there's like... It says there's something... Oh, it's over here.

2025
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,400
It's over here.

2026
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:08,000
Oh.

2027
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,100
Oh, shit.

2028
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:12,200
I can't see that.

2029
02:31:13,900 --> 02:31:16,800
No, he realized I was low HP.

2030
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:19,960
Oh, my God.

2031
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:20,860
I didn't realize.

2032
02:31:21,580 --> 02:31:23,160
Everything does too damage now.

2033
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:24,120
It's so crazy.

2034
02:31:24,580 --> 02:31:26,260
I didn't look at my HP.

2035
02:31:26,660 --> 02:31:30,020
I was too busy, like, stabbing people with my fucking needle.

2036
02:31:31,460 --> 02:31:31,980
Okay.

2037
02:31:32,660 --> 02:31:33,920
I got two guys.

2038
02:31:37,060 --> 02:31:38,860
I'll just drop straight down.

2039
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:40,680
Oh, shit.

2040
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:41,820
I didn't see this guy.

2041
02:31:45,160 --> 02:31:46,040
Alright, nice.

2042
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:48,000
Alright.

2043
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:50,620
I- I- No!

2044
02:32:00,330 --> 02:32:00,930
Oh, wait.

2045
02:32:00,970 --> 02:32:01,690
I didn't have a lot.

2046
02:32:01,810 --> 02:32:02,270
Never mind.

2047
02:32:02,390 --> 02:32:03,410
I already spent it all.

2048
02:32:03,770 --> 02:32:04,410
It's fine.

2049
02:32:04,670 --> 02:32:06,290
I didn't have a lot of money anyway.

2050
02:32:06,570 --> 02:32:07,350
I remember it.

2051
02:32:07,370 --> 02:32:08,590
I already spent all my money.

2052
02:32:11,370 --> 02:32:12,850
I gave it all.

2053
02:32:13,390 --> 02:32:15,450
I already spent all my money to the child.

2054
02:32:16,910 --> 02:32:18,010
To the forager lady.

2055
02:32:20,570 --> 02:32:21,890
Oh my god, it's the same.

2056
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:22,570
Wait, no.

2057
02:32:22,830 --> 02:32:23,410
Wait, what?

2058
02:32:24,950 --> 02:32:26,050
Oh, that's where I died.

2059
02:32:26,270 --> 02:32:26,990
Okay, there you go.

2060
02:32:27,290 --> 02:32:27,770
That's fine.

2061
02:32:29,530 --> 02:32:31,070
Thank god I already spent my money.

2062
02:32:34,970 --> 02:32:36,230
That's the best part.

2063
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:38,010
Can't lose no money!

2064
02:32:41,950 --> 02:32:42,550
Whoa.

2065
02:32:43,470 --> 02:32:43,950
There we go.

2066
02:32:44,770 --> 02:32:47,110
Can't lose my money if it's all gone.

2067
02:32:48,630 --> 02:32:49,470
What's over here?

2068
02:32:50,430 --> 02:32:51,970
This has to be lore related.

2069
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:53,070
Ha!

2070
02:32:53,850 --> 02:32:54,690
Oh, nice.

2071
02:32:54,850 --> 02:32:55,910
I knew there was money here.

2072
02:32:56,750 --> 02:32:59,170
God, I hate that it...

2073
02:32:59,170 --> 02:33:04,230
Because sometimes these beads, they roll out to the door and then they disappear.

2074
02:33:07,070 --> 02:33:08,650
My free money.

2075
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:10,730
It's good.

2076
02:33:10,750 --> 02:33:12,610
Good thing you have the bang.

2077
02:33:21,890 --> 02:33:23,970
Okay, I'm glad that...

2078
02:33:23,970 --> 02:33:24,470
There we go.

2079
02:33:25,630 --> 02:33:29,170
My money!

2080
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:31,170
What?

2081
02:33:31,510 --> 02:33:35,730
I need a magnet.

2082
02:33:35,950 --> 02:33:38,870
I need a fucking rosary magnet or some shit.

2083
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:42,850
It's just fucking crazy that I lose it all.

2084
02:33:44,890 --> 02:33:46,930
Okay, that's fine with me.

2085
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:52,140
Okay.

2086
02:33:54,660 --> 02:33:56,180
I'm fine with that.

2087
02:33:56,420 --> 02:33:56,600
See, look!

2088
02:33:56,680 --> 02:33:58,000
Oh my god, I think I didn't roll off.

2089
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:00,360
Is this...

2090
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:01,520
Okay, it does that.

2091
02:34:02,780 --> 02:34:04,250
Uh... Oh, I didn't go this way.

2092
02:34:07,180 --> 02:34:08,700
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2093
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:10,260

2098
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:19,040
Okay.

2099
02:34:22,220 --> 02:34:22,740
When?

2100
02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:25,020
Oh wait, there's shards here.

2101
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:26,740
Ouch!

2102
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:27,800

2103
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:29,260
Ooh!

2104
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:29,820
Hot!

2105
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:30,280
Hot!

2106
02:34:33,420 --> 02:34:34,860
That's so stupid.

2107
02:34:38,220 --> 02:34:41,940
Just gotta make sure, as long as I keep jumping, I'm fine.

2108
02:34:43,320 --> 02:34:43,760
Ouchy, ouch.

2109
02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:45,480
Hot, hot, hot!

2110
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:47,420
Ooh!

2111
02:34:48,020 --> 02:34:48,320
Hot, hot!

2112
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:51,360
Oh!

2113
02:34:53,300 --> 02:34:54,300
There you go.

2114
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:58,520
Oh my god, he like blocked me there.

2115
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:01,900
Oh, I mean, it's good that he came down and he is the money.

2116
02:35:06,680 --> 02:35:06,980
Nice.

2117
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:08,700
I think like, yeah.

2118
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:14,780
I don't know when exactly I have to like stop moving.

2119
02:35:19,070 --> 02:35:21,970
So I gotta like make sure I don't actually burn.

2120
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:23,870
Because I feel like they do two damage.

2121
02:35:24,190 --> 02:35:26,250
Everything does two damage, apparently.

2122
02:35:27,230 --> 02:35:27,970
Wait, what can I do?

2123
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:30,110
What the fuck was that?

2124
02:35:32,670 --> 02:35:34,550
Oh, I can hold more silk.

2125
02:35:36,170 --> 02:35:36,970
Okay, nice.

2126
02:35:39,050 --> 02:35:39,630
It does.

2127
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:40,310
I knew it.

2128
02:35:40,370 --> 02:35:41,890
Everything does two damage now.

2129
02:35:42,430 --> 02:35:43,010
It sucks.

2130
02:35:44,610 --> 02:35:46,370
I think that's my only gripe.

2131
02:35:47,890 --> 02:35:50,450
A lot of stuff does two damage now.

2132
02:35:54,170 --> 02:35:55,670
That's my only gripe.

2133
02:35:57,010 --> 02:35:57,450
Ow!

2134
02:35:57,710 --> 02:35:58,370
Like this guy.

2135
02:35:58,690 --> 02:35:59,010
Ow!

2136
02:36:01,630 --> 02:36:04,250
Like he's just a fucking slug!

2137
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:13,620
Did I go red?

2138
02:36:13,780 --> 02:36:14,760
Was there anything to the red?

2139
02:36:14,900 --> 02:36:15,560
I don't remember.

2140
02:36:20,110 --> 02:36:21,230
How much money do I have?

2141
02:36:24,350 --> 02:36:25,350
Oh, 120.

2142
02:36:25,650 --> 02:36:25,890
Oh.

2143
02:36:27,770 --> 02:36:28,650
I should have enough.

2144
02:36:28,730 --> 02:36:29,870
Yes, I can buy stuff.

2145
02:36:30,850 --> 02:36:31,210
Nice.

2146
02:36:32,630 --> 02:36:33,070
Where am I?

2147
02:36:33,450 --> 02:36:34,230
Where are you getting?

2148
02:36:34,250 --> 02:36:34,930

02:36:38,190 --> 02:36:38,550

Let's not fuck it up this time.

2152
02:36:42,450 --> 02:36:44,710
Do we get Magma Ball?

2153
02:36:45,470 --> 02:36:45,710
Oh, sorry.

2154
02:36:45,970 --> 02:36:48,150
Magma Bell or Sting Shard?

2155
02:36:56,520 --> 02:36:58,220
I don't know what to do.

2156
02:36:58,980 --> 02:36:59,580

2157
02:36:59,800 --> 02:37:04,860

02:40:06,830 --> 02:40:09,670
I definitely, that's why I know I will get dash.

2171
02:40:11,250 --> 02:40:13,270

2172
02:40:13,950 --> 02:40:14,570

Sorry, I wasn't looking.

2176
02:40:29,570 --> 02:40:30,930
Okay, there you go.

2177
02:40:31,930 --> 02:40:35,070
How else was I supposed to take that implication?

2178
02:40:36,650 --> 02:40:37,970
I don't think I could...

2179
02:40:37,970 --> 02:40:41,270
Yeah, I can't go up because...

2180
02:40:41,270 --> 02:40:46,690
I know I can't go up because it's locked, right?

2181
02:40:47,570 --> 02:40:50,390
Guys, does anyone remember if the bench is up top, it's locked?

2182
02:40:52,190 --> 02:40:53,250
You remember?

2183
02:40:53,530 --> 02:40:53,990
When?

2184
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:03,580
The bench up top, the pathway to the right, it's locked, right?

2185
02:41:04,680 --> 02:41:05,000
Yeah?

2186
02:41:05,140 --> 02:41:07,920
Okay, we'll just, I guess it's time to go to the ant world.

2187
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:15,000
Alright, we'll go to ant world now.

2188
02:41:15,380 --> 02:41:16,780
Guys, we're going to ant world!

2189
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:20,860
It's like Disneyland, but it's all ants.

2190
02:41:21,620 --> 02:41:27,160
I don't want to go to ant world.

2191
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:28,160
It's too late!

2192
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:29,620
We're going to ant world!

2193
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:39,720
We're fucking going to Ant World.

2194
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:50,200
Alright.

2195
02:41:52,460 --> 02:41:54,020
That and stash might be Ant World.

2196
02:41:54,140 --> 02:41:55,140
Yeah, I think so too.

2197
02:41:55,720 --> 02:41:57,420
I assume so as well.

2198
02:41:58,180 --> 02:41:58,380
Ow.

2199
02:41:59,140 --> 02:41:59,540
Jesus.

2200
02:42:04,850 --> 02:42:05,930
We're gonna get ants!

2201
02:42:06,390 --> 02:42:06,550
Ants!

2202
02:42:06,890 --> 02:42:07,650
Ants in my pants!

2203
02:42:09,410 --> 02:42:11,850
Wait, I remember that this was a chair.

2204
02:42:13,550 --> 02:42:15,650
It was locked, but there was a chair there.

2205
02:42:19,250 --> 02:42:19,830
Okay, nice.

2206
02:42:26,300 --> 02:42:27,300
Ant world time!

2207
02:42:28,660 --> 02:42:29,500
Oh my god.

2208
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:31,400
Stupid fucking ants!

2209
02:42:36,680 --> 02:42:38,600
We deserve ant world.

2210
02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:43,460
Where's my map of ant world?

2211
02:42:45,880 --> 02:42:46,960
When?

2212
02:42:48,740 --> 02:42:49,000
Hello?

2213
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:51,080
Oh shit.

2214
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:57,780
Oh, they're like...

2215
02:42:57,780 --> 02:42:59,700
They're like rogues.

2216
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:02,260
At rogues.

2217
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:07,340
Jesus Christ!

2218
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:08,840
It was one needle!

2219
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,360
And you're still alive?

2220
02:43:13,400 --> 02:43:13,940
Okay.

2221
02:43:17,220 --> 02:43:18,300
Okay.

2222
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:20,940
Nice.

2223
02:43:23,640 --> 02:43:23,900
That's right.

2224
02:43:24,180 --> 02:43:25,400
I killed your friend.

2225
02:43:26,240 --> 02:43:26,500
Whoa.

2226
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:30,540
My turn.

2227
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:32,520
Get out of here.

2228
02:43:33,480 --> 02:43:34,800
I rule Antworld.

2229
02:43:37,180 --> 02:43:39,360
I'm your new queen of Antworld.

2230
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:41,560
Call me.

2231
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:43,540
Call me Walt Doki.

2232
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:48,140
Oh, now it teaches me to look down.

2233
02:43:52,320 --> 02:43:53,080
Wow.

2234
02:43:54,720 --> 02:43:54,980
Thank you.

2235
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:58,900
What would I do without look down?

2236
02:44:00,220 --> 02:44:00,600
When?

2237
02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:07,490
Thank God.

2238
02:44:09,130 --> 02:44:10,030
What an honor.

2239
02:44:13,070 --> 02:44:15,610
I was finally taught to look down.

2240
02:44:19,670 --> 02:44:23,150
What did I do to deserve such an honor?

2241
02:44:25,390 --> 02:44:26,750
Where's my chair?

2242
02:44:28,070 --> 02:44:29,110
Yay, chair.

2243
02:44:30,550 --> 02:44:31,250
Oh, fuck.

2244
02:44:31,470 --> 02:44:32,110
That was an accident.

2245
02:44:33,950 --> 02:44:35,550
Gamers don't look down.

2246
02:44:37,010 --> 02:44:37,250
True.

2247
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:39,550
So true.

2248
02:44:42,910 --> 02:44:44,450
Oh, did I just literally...

2249
02:44:44,450 --> 02:44:45,090
Oh, my God.

2250
02:44:45,230 --> 02:44:46,490
I literally went...

2251
02:44:46,490 --> 02:44:48,570
Oh, I unlocked the area.

2252
02:44:50,090 --> 02:44:50,550
Oh!

2253
02:44:51,370 --> 02:44:53,370
I'm going to unlock the shortcut now.

2254
02:44:56,600 --> 02:44:57,220
Okay.

2255
02:45:01,010 --> 02:45:03,650
This feels very Bosch-like.

2256
02:45:04,590 --> 02:45:05,410
Oh, it's no power-up.

2257
02:45:05,870 --> 02:45:07,270
Oh, this is where I get power-ups.

2258
02:45:08,530 --> 02:45:09,990
Daughter of a distant land.

2259
02:45:10,650 --> 02:45:13,290
We who remain have long waited long.

2260
02:45:14,230 --> 02:45:15,930
Bind our strength to yours.

2261
02:45:16,510 --> 02:45:19,130
Reclaim the future of our haunted kingdom.

2262
02:45:23,300 --> 02:45:23,920
Fine.

2263
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:27,280
Give me the power of Dash.

2264
02:45:31,290 --> 02:45:31,870
Is Dash?

2265
02:45:33,450 --> 02:45:33,630
Oh.

2266
02:45:33,650 --> 02:46:04,970

2267
02:46:06,810 --> 02:46:09,090
Yeah, I killed it before I got dashed.

2268
02:46:11,890 --> 02:46:12,490
Oops.

2269
02:46:15,270 --> 02:46:15,630
There we go.

2270
02:46:17,630 --> 02:46:19,010
It definitely feels like it.

2271
02:46:20,110 --> 02:46:21,630
Okay, there's something above me.

2272
02:46:22,630 --> 02:46:28,250
This dash isn't even the... This dash is weird because you go... you go down.

2273
02:46:29,010 --> 02:46:30,470
I don't know how I feel about this dash.

2274
02:46:36,540 --> 02:46:36,980
Okay.

2275
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:40,880
You actually, you fall a bit down when you're dashing.

2276
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:43,780
So it's not even a full dash, yeah.

2277
02:46:44,700 --> 02:46:47,320
Hello, here's an, I saved another child.

2278
02:46:47,800 --> 02:46:49,600
They look like dogs.

2279
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:51,140
They look like dogs.

2280
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:52,400
They're like dog kids.

2281
02:46:53,380 --> 02:46:57,220
Maybe they're like one of those adults that think their dogs are their kids.

2282
02:46:57,560 --> 02:46:57,860
You know?

2283
02:46:58,140 --> 02:47:00,340
You're like the ones that buy those strollers for them.

2284
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:03,120
Like you look, be like, oh is that a baby?

2285
02:47:03,280 --> 02:47:05,580
And then you look in it and it's an actual dog.

2286
02:47:12,740 --> 02:47:15,120
Okay, where do I go now?

2287
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:18,100
Wait, what's the...

2288
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:20,160
I'm trying to figure where to go.

2289
02:47:21,400 --> 02:47:22,700
I guess I go to Atworld.

2290
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:26,900
I go to Atworld?

2291
02:47:29,240 --> 02:47:38,080
Why do I go to...

2292
02:47:38,080 --> 02:47:39,220
I don't know where to go.

2293
02:47:43,420 --> 02:47:44,360
Wait, it's a sprint?

2294
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:45,380
What do you mean?

2295
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:47,220
Yeah, I can run fast.

2296
02:47:50,830 --> 02:47:51,190
Alright.

2297
02:47:51,890 --> 02:47:52,410
No, I already...

2298
02:47:52,410 --> 02:47:53,170
Did I not unlock that?

2299
02:47:53,190 --> 02:47:54,170
Oh, yeah, I was broke.

2300
02:47:54,290 --> 02:47:55,150
I didn't unlock it.

2301
02:47:55,230 --> 02:47:56,210
How much money do I have?

2302
02:47:56,870 --> 02:47:57,510
I have enough.

2303
02:47:58,770 --> 02:48:00,090
I forgot to unlock this...

2304
02:48:00,090 --> 02:48:00,530
The tram.

2305
02:48:04,410 --> 02:48:05,250
Alright, ring ring.

2306
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:06,870
What is the dog gonna do with money?

2307
02:48:08,350 --> 02:48:08,710
Like...

2308
02:48:12,190 --> 02:48:14,130
What the fuck are you gonna do with money?

2309
02:48:14,230 --> 02:48:15,210
You're a dog!

2310
02:48:16,150 --> 02:48:16,510
Okay.

2311
02:48:19,010 --> 02:48:19,350
Okay.

2312
02:48:19,370 --> 02:48:22,710
Oh my god, I'm getting my zoomies.

2313
02:48:23,850 --> 02:48:25,940
I just have my zoomies right now.

2314
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:31,110
I actually have zoomies.

2315
02:48:31,570 --> 02:48:32,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2316
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:40,020

02:48:40,360 --> 02:48:41,200
Look at James.

2318
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:42,380
Look at Sanco.

2319
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:47,260
Okay.

2320
02:48:49,060 --> 02:48:50,300
I'm drifting.

2321
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:53,180
I'm actually drifting right now.

2322
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:57,040
Chasing my tail, yeah.

2323
02:49:01,660 --> 02:49:03,240
Ah, steal from this guy.

2324
02:49:05,940 --> 02:49:06,200

Oh my god, it took three hours.

2331
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:31,880
Where do I go?

2332
02:49:32,280 --> 02:49:33,200
I think I have to go to Antworld.

2333
02:49:33,340 --> 02:49:35,360
I feel like... I think I did everything down here.

2334
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:38,040
I required dash, right?

2335
02:49:39,620 --> 02:49:40,420
I don't remember.

2336
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:42,420
I think... Oh, maybe downstairs.

2337
02:49:42,520 --> 02:49:44,760
Now that I have my dash...

2338
02:49:46,660 --> 02:49:47,240
Wait, here.

2339
02:49:47,320 --> 02:49:47,680
Oh, here.

2340
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:48,180
There you go.

2341
02:49:53,020 --> 02:49:53,680
There you go.

2342
02:49:53,940 --> 02:49:54,880
This is what I need to do.

2343
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:56,460
I don't remember now.

2344
02:50:01,640 --> 02:50:02,680
Hello!

2345
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:09,920

02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:12,580
So lost, so weak.

2347

2349
02:50:18,340 --> 02:50:19,460
Little spider.

That's right.

2363
02:51:29,640 --> 02:51:31,360
That's why you're a child.

2373
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:25,320
I can't believe it ever since I died to the child.

2374
02:52:25,520 --> 02:52:26,840
I don't know what's wrong with me.

2375
02:52:28,140 --> 02:52:28,140
Okay.

2376
02:52:29,120 --> 02:52:30,280
I can't believe it.

2377
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:34,800
I was doing so well, but our new booze threw, it threw me off my groove.

2378
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:41,740
I was doing so fucking...

2379
02:52:41,740 --> 02:52:43,460
I was dodging and everything.

2380
02:52:43,580 --> 02:52:45,720
I just did not expect her to do that.

2381
02:52:46,340 --> 02:52:47,220
Alright, here we go.

2382
02:52:48,160 --> 02:52:49,920
Give me my cocoon back.

2383
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:53,440
Okay.

2384
02:52:58,250 --> 02:52:58,530
Okay.

2385
02:53:02,270 --> 02:53:04,410
Like, she's so predictable.

2386
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:05,250
Like that.

2387
02:53:07,810 --> 02:53:12,170
But then she does that crazy-ass move that's like, what the...

2388
02:53:12,190 --> 02:53:13,550
Oh, fuck.

2389
02:53:16,410 --> 02:53:17,310
Oh, a fucking...

2390
02:53:17,850 --> 02:53:18,370
What?

2391
02:53:20,490 --> 02:53:21,450
Like that!

2392
02:53:21,630 --> 02:53:23,390
Like, what the fuck is that?

2393
02:53:24,370 --> 02:53:25,050
Oh my god.

2394
02:53:25,310 --> 02:53:25,450
Okay.

2395
02:53:28,830 --> 02:53:29,930
Okay, nice.

2396
02:53:35,850 --> 02:53:36,250
Alright.

2397
02:53:37,570 --> 02:53:38,210
Okay.

2398
02:53:38,570 --> 02:53:39,370
That's fine.

2399
02:53:39,890 --> 02:53:41,170
I'm gonna save this.

2400
02:53:41,350 --> 02:53:41,970
Actually, no.

2401
02:53:42,770 --> 02:53:43,950
Okay, nice.

2402
02:53:44,130 --> 02:53:45,410
I do dash for that then.

2403
02:53:48,650 --> 02:53:52,510
It's so risky to use the needle as a tax.

2404
02:53:52,710 --> 02:53:53,170
There we go.

2405
02:53:53,370 --> 02:53:54,210
Second try.

2406
02:53:56,590 --> 02:53:57,850
Second, that's right.

2433
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:33,940
I need a friend.

2434
02:56:37,490 --> 02:56:38,050
Yeah, no.

2435
02:56:38,150 --> 02:56:39,350
He canceled my friend.

2436
02:56:40,430 --> 02:56:41,530
That's fucked up.

2437
02:56:42,590 --> 02:56:43,410
What's this?

2438
02:56:46,410 --> 02:56:48,210
Okay, stuff that I don't have.

2439
02:56:50,090 --> 02:56:50,450
Wait.

2440
02:56:54,200 --> 02:56:54,840
Okay.

2441
02:56:55,600 --> 02:56:56,200
Okay.

2442
02:56:57,460 --> 02:56:57,940
Yes!

2443
02:56:59,740 --> 02:57:00,280
There we go.

2444
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:02,920
I don't know if I'm supposed to be here.

2445
02:57:03,520 --> 02:57:04,840
This entire game is like me.

2446
02:57:05,160 --> 02:57:06,200
Am I supposed to be here?

2447
02:57:07,060 --> 02:57:08,640
That's me the entire game.

2448
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:11,160
Because I can't wall dash.

2449
02:57:11,820 --> 02:57:12,480
Or wall, yeah.

2450
02:57:16,480 --> 02:57:18,420
I want to try and kill him.

2451
02:57:23,710 --> 02:57:25,530
Oh my god, does this reset them?

2452
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:32,500
Friend!

2453
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:33,880
Oh yes!

2454
02:57:33,980 --> 02:57:34,600
Okay, I got it.

2455
02:57:39,100 --> 02:57:39,860
It's fine.

2456
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:42,580
Okay, I have maximum shards.

2457
02:57:42,700 --> 02:57:44,640
I still don't know what to do with my shards, though.

2458
02:57:48,610 --> 02:57:49,490
I am...

2459
02:57:49,490 --> 02:57:51,670
I am a little confused.

2460
02:57:52,870 --> 02:57:54,430
Because I don't have map.

2461
02:57:56,250 --> 02:57:57,350
Okay, I'll full heal.

2462
02:57:57,990 --> 02:57:58,390
Friend!

2463
02:58:03,640 --> 02:58:04,400
There we go.

2464
02:58:04,860 --> 02:58:05,580
Maybe go down?

2465
02:58:06,800 --> 02:58:07,220
I forgot.

2466
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:10,380
I keep thinking that I can live through lava.

2467
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:13,360
I keep thinking.

2468
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:16,520
Okay, I go to Atworld.

2469
02:58:17,420 --> 02:58:20,040
Maybe Atworld has, uh...

2470
02:58:20,820 --> 02:58:24,760
Maybe Atworld has, uh...

2471
02:58:24,760 --> 02:58:26,220
Has Wall Dash.

2472
02:58:28,040 --> 02:58:28,880
Maybe.

2473
02:58:29,140 --> 02:58:29,900
I don't know.

2474
02:58:30,980 --> 02:58:32,420
Just like...

2475
02:58:32,420 --> 02:58:32,960
Maybe.

2476
02:58:34,980 --> 02:58:36,920
Is there anything else I need a Dash for?

2477
02:58:37,360 --> 02:58:38,080
Maybe here?

2478
02:58:44,370 --> 02:58:44,790
Wait.

2479
02:58:45,570 --> 02:58:46,430
Down here.

2480
02:58:49,850 --> 02:58:52,230
I remember there was like...

2481
02:58:52,230 --> 02:58:52,850
Yeah, here.

2482
02:58:53,530 --> 02:58:54,670
Oh, it doesn't matter.

2483
02:58:56,470 --> 02:58:57,870
I don't have the key.

2484
02:58:59,370 --> 02:59:00,810
Okay, it's time to go to Ant World.

2485
02:59:01,810 --> 02:59:04,270
Alright guys, now we're actually going to Ant World.

2486
02:59:06,710 --> 02:59:07,910
Come on, kids!

2487
02:59:08,470 --> 02:59:10,670
Instead of going to Disney World, we're going to Ant World.

2488
02:59:11,030 --> 02:59:12,290
It's our favorite place.

2489
02:59:13,130 --> 02:59:15,390
I don't care if you don't want to go to Ant World.

2490
02:59:15,930 --> 02:59:18,110
I spent good money for Ant World.

2491
02:59:22,390 --> 02:59:37,430
okay how much money do i have like how much rosaries do i have 122 i can't buy but i want to go well too damn bad your mom can't afford lego land

2492
02:59:41,590 --> 02:59:52,770
can't afford lego land this is our this is all we can afford not at world Oh, I gotta see that movie.

2493
02:59:56,670 --> 02:59:58,230
Alright, this way.

2494
03:00:00,570 --> 03:00:02,390
I wish, oh wait, here.

2495
03:00:04,870 --> 03:00:05,150
No.

2496
03:00:05,710 --> 03:00:08,850
Is there anything that requires, like, dash?

2497
03:00:12,670 --> 03:00:14,570
And world is just like Legoland.

2498
03:00:15,130 --> 03:00:19,230
It's, just imagine the ants are like, various Legos.

2499
03:00:21,530 --> 03:00:22,790
It's almost a...

2500
03:00:22,790 --> 03:00:23,910
Oh my god.

2501
03:00:26,650 --> 03:00:28,970
It's almost the same thing.

2502
03:00:30,730 --> 03:00:32,850
I keep thinking it's a full dash.

2503
03:00:33,470 --> 03:00:37,130
I think, like, it's just me trying to unlearn all the Hollow Knight stuff.

2504
03:00:38,670 --> 03:00:39,610
Okay, this way.

2505
03:00:44,880 --> 03:00:45,200
Yeah.

2506
03:00:45,560 --> 03:00:48,560
This game is just me unlearning Hollow Knight mechanics.

2507
03:00:55,100 --> 03:01:00,900
If you build the answer together, they could technically become they could technically become Lego.

2508
03:01:01,220 --> 03:01:06,580
It's like when you try, you know, like fire ants, if you try to drown them in water, they'll just build a raft.

2509
03:01:09,080 --> 03:01:11,300
Just Pogo, shake my head.

2510
03:01:14,660 --> 03:01:14,980
Run.

2511
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:16,900
What's over here?

2512
03:01:18,440 --> 03:01:18,900
Oh, nothing.

2513
03:01:22,640 --> 03:01:23,100
Alright.

2514
03:01:24,300 --> 03:01:27,240
No, I don't have the key for the guy for the jail.

2515
03:01:29,300 --> 03:01:29,820
Okay.

2516
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:31,520
It's Pogo time.

2517
03:01:32,220 --> 03:01:33,320
Gotta hide in this area.

2518
03:01:37,940 --> 03:01:38,160
Oh, wait.

2519
03:01:38,200 --> 03:01:39,360
This is where I found the child.

2520
03:01:40,480 --> 03:01:41,460
The dog child.

2521
03:01:44,580 --> 03:01:45,420
Jesus Christ!

2522
03:01:48,420 --> 03:01:48,920
Gwen.

2523
03:01:50,260 --> 03:01:51,340
They're just everywhere.

2524
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:53,060
They're just everywhere.

2525
03:01:55,200 --> 03:01:56,140
Get out of here.

2526
03:01:56,440 --> 03:01:56,640
Gwen.

2527
03:02:00,100 --> 03:02:03,460
Step on an ant does not hurt as nearly as much as stepping on a leg.

2528
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:04,900
That's exactly, that's an improvement!

2529
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:08,100
That's basically an improvement!

2530
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:15,460
If you think about it, it's better than Lego!

2531
03:02:16,260 --> 03:02:18,160
They don't hurt unless they're fire ants.

2532
03:02:26,050 --> 03:02:27,630
Okay, they can jump too.

2533
03:02:28,230 --> 03:02:29,390
That's good to know.

2534
03:02:29,610 --> 03:02:30,590
Oh, what the fuck?

2535
03:02:33,510 --> 03:02:35,550
Jesus, they're so fast.

2536
03:02:37,190 --> 03:02:37,930
Oh my!

2537
03:02:37,950 --> 03:02:40,790
I thought that I was really thought they would jump further.

2538
03:02:41,230 --> 03:02:44,450
These guys are tanky as hell Oh my god.

2539
03:02:44,590 --> 03:02:45,810
There's oh, and then he's gone

2540
03:02:49,730 --> 03:02:50,430
That's fine.

2541
03:02:50,530 --> 03:02:56,210
I'll take that Wait, all right Excuse me.

2542
03:02:56,270 --> 03:02:58,130
I was like, how do I take it?

2543
03:02:58,490 --> 03:02:59,690
They're so tanky.

2544
03:02:59,750 --> 03:03:01,610
I know I was like, what the fuck?

2545
03:03:03,270 --> 03:03:09,090
Oh my god these stupid Fucking ass!

2546
03:03:15,010 --> 03:03:17,290
Oh my god, I hate them.

2547
03:03:19,580 --> 03:03:21,730
I hate them so much.

2548
03:03:22,430 --> 03:03:22,810
I-

2549
03:03:26,290 --> 03:03:30,430
Oh my god, oh my god, I had a feeling.

2550
03:03:31,350 --> 03:03:33,870
Oh my god.

2551
03:03:34,510 --> 03:03:39,590
I had a feeling.

2552
03:03:42,690 --> 03:03:43,770
Okay, thank God.

2553
03:03:44,270 --> 03:03:44,630
What?

2554
03:03:45,890 --> 03:03:46,690
That's fine.

2555
03:03:47,110 --> 03:03:48,290
I got my heel up.

2556
03:03:49,230 --> 03:03:50,270
That's all I care about.

2557
03:03:51,190 --> 03:03:51,290
Jesus!

2558
03:03:51,730 --> 03:03:52,750
They're so...

2559
03:03:52,750 --> 03:03:53,310
Thank you!

2560
03:03:53,930 --> 03:03:58,190
Here we go.

2561
03:03:58,950 --> 03:03:59,510
What?

2562
03:04:01,650 --> 03:04:01,730
What?

2563
03:04:01,870 --> 03:04:01,870
What?

2564
03:04:02,190 --> 03:04:03,250
Oh, thank God she's helping!

2565
03:04:03,530 --> 03:04:04,130
Oh, thank God!

2566
03:04:04,370 --> 03:04:05,030
Oh, Shakira!

2567
03:04:06,110 --> 03:04:06,510
Shakira!

2568
03:04:07,970 --> 03:04:08,530

2569
03:04:09,490 --> 03:04:10,530
Oh, Shakira!

2570
03:04:11,250 --> 03:04:11,810

She did, like, her bracelet, like, disoriented me so much.

2574
03:04:54,050 --> 03:04:58,570
It was actually, like, yes, thank you, Shakira, for helping me.

2575
03:04:59,750 --> 03:05:01,870
But I don't know what to do.

03:07:42,020 --> 03:07:43,220
Oh, Shalom.

2613
03:07:44,860 --> 03:07:46,360
Oh, hello.

2614
03:07:47,700 --> 03:07:48,960
Oh, hello.

2615
03:07:49,960 --> 03:07:50,360
Oh, Shalom.

2616
03:07:50,360 --> 03:07:51,420
Oh, Lari, Lari.

2617
03:07:51,940 --> 03:07:53,380
Oh, Shalom.

2618
03:07:56,460 --> 03:07:59,300
That was battle well fought, child.

2619
03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:03,120
Mielding needle, your master would be proud of you.

2620
03:08:05,760 --> 03:08:07,820
The one who trained me long ago.

2621
03:08:08,240 --> 03:08:09,360
I never called her master.

2622
03:08:10,020 --> 03:08:12,660
What if she would be proud of what has become of me?

2623
03:08:13,080 --> 03:08:14,020
I cannot say.

2624
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:16,600
Nuhakatata.

2625
03:08:17,460 --> 03:08:18,480
Oh, Nuhakata.

2626
03:08:19,360 --> 03:08:21,040
Whether she is dead or alive.

2627
03:08:21,540 --> 03:08:22,180
Have faith.

2628
03:08:22,700 --> 03:08:24,500
Nothing a pupil does escaped her master.

2629
03:08:24,520 --> 03:08:25,380
master's sight.

2630
03:08:25,800 --> 03:08:26,620
Oh, she's alive.

2631
03:08:27,500 --> 03:08:29,320
Sadly, not in my stomach, though.

2632
03:08:30,620 --> 03:08:31,200
Oh, nice.

2633
03:08:31,300 --> 03:08:33,440
Now I can afford this.

2634
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:36,080
You guys wouldn't let me eat her.

2635
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:38,860
God, so sad.

2636
03:08:40,460 --> 03:08:40,800
Oh, yeah.

2637
03:08:40,880 --> 03:08:41,140
Oh, wait.

2638
03:08:41,140 --> 03:08:42,540
I forgot to show you guys this one.

2639
03:08:44,820 --> 03:08:46,920
When the axe comes over.

2640
03:08:48,660 --> 03:08:49,780
Wait, girl.

2641
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:52,540
Big buggy mommy.

2642
03:08:59,340 --> 03:09:00,140
Pickpucky mommy

2643
03:09:14,540 --> 03:09:18,780
Oh my god Okay I need to see if I can

2644
03:09:23,220 --> 03:09:24,100
I realize...

2645
03:09:24,100 --> 03:09:25,220
Maybe I should...

2646
03:09:25,220 --> 03:09:29,940
I'm gonna ask Neopal if she can fix the thing so you see that...

2647
03:09:29,940 --> 03:09:30,880
Yeah, I don't like that.

2648
03:09:31,200 --> 03:09:32,780
Where the head sort of disappears a little.

2649
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:35,320
So I'm gonna ask her to fix that.

2650
03:09:35,600 --> 03:09:38,180
My bottom part of my head disappears a little bit.

2651
03:09:43,940 --> 03:09:44,960
Okay, now I can heal.

2652
03:09:48,020 --> 03:09:48,440
Wait, what?

2653
03:09:48,440 --> 03:09:48,520
Ah!

2654
03:09:48,980 --> 03:09:49,100
Ah!

2655
03:09:49,100 --> 03:09:49,200
Ah!

2656
03:09:50,500 --> 03:09:51,840
I was so confused.

2657
03:09:51,880 --> 03:09:53,740
I was like, what the fuck is that?

2658
03:09:54,680 --> 03:09:55,120
What?

2659
03:09:56,500 --> 03:09:58,080
I was, like, looking at this.

2660
03:09:58,240 --> 03:09:59,900
I was so confused what that is.

2661
03:10:00,500 --> 03:10:01,220
What does that do?

2662
03:10:01,360 --> 03:10:02,060
Was that thread?

2663
03:10:05,360 --> 03:10:05,700
Ah.

2664
03:10:07,180 --> 03:10:07,660
Wait.

2665
03:10:09,820 --> 03:10:10,300
Okay.

2666
03:10:17,040 --> 03:10:17,880
Oh, my God.

2667
03:10:17,960 --> 03:10:18,580
Not these guys.

2668
03:10:18,760 --> 03:10:19,520
Not these guys.

2669
03:10:20,120 --> 03:10:20,600
I...

2670
03:10:20,600 --> 03:10:22,200
Let's get me out of here.

2671
03:10:22,520 --> 03:10:22,700
Ah!

2672
03:10:24,340 --> 03:10:25,420
I mean, that works.

2673
03:10:28,340 --> 03:10:31,020
I didn't realize they were, like, just...

2674
03:10:31,040 --> 03:10:31,400
there.

2675
03:10:32,140 --> 03:10:33,360
I don't want to deal with them.

2676
03:10:33,960 --> 03:10:34,740
What's over here?

2677
03:10:34,980 --> 03:10:36,020
Oh, shit.

2678
03:10:36,400 --> 03:10:38,080
Got that stupid fucking traps.

2679
03:10:40,060 --> 03:10:40,420
Okay.

2680
03:10:44,140 --> 03:10:44,900
Oh, my God.

2681
03:10:45,080 --> 03:10:46,580
That's another trap, isn't it?

2682
03:10:48,820 --> 03:10:49,680
Oh, oh, oh.

2683
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:53,140
Oh.

2684
03:10:53,460 --> 03:10:54,140
Not trapped?

2685
03:10:54,820 --> 03:10:55,500
Not trapped?

2686
03:10:56,980 --> 03:10:57,460
Oh, my God.

2687
03:10:57,540 --> 03:10:58,660
It wasn't a trap.

2688
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:00,440
Ow.

2689
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:04,040
Stop.

2690
03:11:04,060 --> 03:11:34,280

2692
03:11:39,880 --> 03:11:40,460
What?

2693
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:42,660
I can't go anywhere there.

2694
03:11:44,020 --> 03:11:45,900
I think I need to unlock something for that.

2695
03:11:51,350 --> 03:11:51,870
Oh!

2696
03:11:52,410 --> 03:11:52,490
Oh!

2697
03:11:52,750 --> 03:11:52,870
Oh!

2698
03:11:53,470 --> 03:11:53,630
Oh!

2699
03:11:53,930 --> 03:11:54,130
No!

2700
03:11:57,170 --> 03:11:58,590
It's not fair!

2701
03:11:58,770 --> 03:12:01,070
Why did you not build traps?

2702
03:12:02,030 --> 03:12:02,450
How?

2703
03:12:02,490 --> 03:12:03,730
He's so smart!

2704
03:12:08,290 --> 03:12:09,970
Oh my god, the infection!

2705
03:12:09,990 --> 03:12:17,810

2708
03:13:27,470 --> 03:13:29,130
Okay, now I'm back here.

2709
03:13:30,270 --> 03:13:31,730
Where the fuck do I go?

2710
03:13:37,380 --> 03:13:39,300
Okay, so there is like...

2711
03:13:46,950 --> 03:13:49,250
This Pogo will be the death of me.

2712
03:13:51,250 --> 03:13:54,030
Because I can't reach up top there.

2713
03:14:00,180 --> 03:14:02,280
I hate this Pogo.

2714
03:14:04,980 --> 03:14:06,640
Oh my god.

2715
03:14:07,980 --> 03:14:09,400
Because I can't reach up that.

2716
03:14:10,480 --> 03:14:10,900
I...

2717
03:14:11,200 --> 03:14:11,840
Oh,

2718
03:14:19,920 --> 03:14:20,920
go then dash.

2719
03:14:24,520 --> 03:14:26,300
How do I...

2720
03:14:26,300 --> 03:14:27,220
How do I...

2721
03:14:27,220 --> 03:14:28,360
Oh my...

2722
03:14:28,360 --> 03:14:29,740
Oh my god.

2723
03:14:29,880 --> 03:14:30,900
I had to do that.

2724
03:14:31,240 --> 03:14:33,800
I don't know if I cheesed it or if that's...

2725
03:14:33,800 --> 03:14:35,280
I'm so sad.

2726
03:14:36,040 --> 03:14:37,740
I am so sad.

2727
03:14:38,200 --> 03:14:38,780
I don't know...

2728
03:14:39,380 --> 03:14:39,900
Okay.

2729
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:42,940
I'm so sad.

2730
03:14:46,600 --> 03:14:48,180
Oh, my.

2731
03:14:48,400 --> 03:14:49,680
This is the test.

2732
03:14:50,900 --> 03:14:53,320
This is the ultimate Pogo test.

2733
03:14:56,160 --> 03:14:57,940
Oh, my God.

2734
03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:02,200
Oh, my God.

2735
03:15:03,340 --> 03:15:04,900
This is my purgatory.

2736
03:15:05,780 --> 03:15:08,200
This particular Pogo...

2737
03:15:10,160 --> 03:15:11,300
God damn it.

2738
03:15:14,140 --> 03:15:17,220
Literally, this Pogo is my purgatory.

2739
03:15:20,900 --> 03:15:23,940
If I can do this, I've mastered this Pogo.

2740
03:15:24,600 --> 03:15:29,340
If I can do this, I have mastered this Pogo.

2741
03:15:38,600 --> 03:15:40,460
Like, I can't hit that.

2742
03:15:42,080 --> 03:15:43,300
What the fuck?

2743
03:15:50,390 --> 03:15:52,070
Like, what the fuck?

2744
03:15:52,090 --> 03:15:52,530
How do I hit?

2745
03:15:57,100 --> 03:15:58,260
Oh my god.

2746
03:15:59,060 --> 03:16:00,100
Dash then Pogo?

2747
03:16:01,780 --> 03:16:02,620
I feel like...

2748
03:16:02,620 --> 03:16:04,060
Do we need double jump for that?

2749
03:16:09,630 --> 03:16:10,150
Okay.

2750
03:16:10,990 --> 03:16:12,010
Because I can only do this.

2751
03:16:13,390 --> 03:16:14,010
Yeah, see?

2752
03:16:14,130 --> 03:16:15,230
I don't have enough height.

2753
03:16:18,770 --> 03:16:19,770
Oh my god.

2754
03:16:20,030 --> 03:16:20,770
That was an accident.

2755
03:16:25,560 --> 03:16:27,080
Do I need double jump?

2756
03:16:27,220 --> 03:16:28,880
I don't know if I have enough height for this.

2757
03:16:30,260 --> 03:16:30,900
Like look.

2758
03:16:31,240 --> 03:16:32,240
I go up here.

2759
03:16:32,880 --> 03:16:36,040
If I dash, like, see?

2760
03:16:36,300 --> 03:16:37,220
Look at that.

2761
03:16:39,820 --> 03:16:41,060
I'll try again.

2762
03:16:41,320 --> 03:16:42,700
If I can just...

2763
03:16:44,440 --> 03:16:44,680
See?

2764
03:16:44,840 --> 03:16:45,660
Oh my god.

2765
03:16:47,880 --> 03:16:50,400
Because I need like a certain height to do these.

2766
03:16:56,560 --> 03:16:57,080
Jesus.

2767
03:16:58,500 --> 03:16:58,940
Jesus!

2768
03:17:04,340 --> 03:17:06,300
I'm gonna go.

2769
03:17:06,300 --> 03:17:06,640
I'm gonna go.

2770
03:17:06,660 --> 03:17:07,100
better though.

2771
03:17:07,140 --> 03:17:08,920
I'm building muscle memory off of these.

2772
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:10,520
Yeah, I can't.

2773
03:17:14,110 --> 03:17:15,490
We'll go the opposite way?

2774
03:17:15,650 --> 03:17:16,150
What do you mean?

2775
03:17:17,550 --> 03:17:18,430
Like this?

2776
03:17:23,150 --> 03:17:23,590
Sick.

2777
03:17:23,790 --> 03:17:25,330
No, the wind doesn't do shit.

2778
03:17:26,090 --> 03:17:26,970
Oh my God!

2779
03:17:27,070 --> 03:17:27,430
Ah!

2780
03:17:28,310 --> 03:17:29,770
I don't know how I did it!

2781
03:17:30,730 --> 03:17:32,250
I don't know how I did that.

2782
03:17:32,890 --> 03:17:33,890
I don't know how I did it.

2783
03:17:34,050 --> 03:17:35,110
I don't know how I did it.

2784
03:17:37,490 --> 03:17:38,770
That's the worst part.

2785
03:17:40,450 --> 03:17:42,490
The wind doesn't do shit, by the way.

2786
03:17:45,980 --> 03:17:47,400
I don't know how I did.

2787
03:17:47,580 --> 03:17:48,340
It's actually...

2788
03:17:48,340 --> 03:17:50,780
I don't know if I'm, like, cheesing it right now, too.

2789
03:17:51,840 --> 03:17:56,200
God, I fucking made it.

2790
03:17:56,780 --> 03:17:58,460
I fucking made it.

2791
03:17:58,600 --> 03:17:59,720
Holy shit.

2792
03:18:00,780 --> 03:18:02,240
Is this the queen at?

2793
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:05,600
Hello?

2794
03:18:07,680 --> 03:18:08,280
Goodness.

2795
03:18:09,020 --> 03:18:11,140
This is just too embarrassing.

2796
03:18:11,860 --> 03:18:14,160
Detected even through my perfect cover.

2797
03:18:14,920 --> 03:18:15,680
What tell?

2798
03:18:16,760 --> 03:18:16,760
Whatever.

2799
03:18:17,560 --> 03:18:19,140
Surely something gave me away.

2800
03:18:19,380 --> 03:18:22,220
It was one thing, young bug.

2801
03:18:22,740 --> 03:18:24,340
Your disguise is near...

2802
03:18:24,340 --> 03:18:24,680
Oh, wait.

2803
03:18:24,800 --> 03:18:26,720
It was one... No one thing, young bug.

2804
03:18:26,840 --> 03:18:28,500
Your disguise is nearly faultless.

2805
03:18:29,040 --> 03:18:31,680
I've merely spent a long life being watchful.

2806
03:18:32,960 --> 03:18:36,800
Then I'll just have to hope to feast about don't share such keen sights.

2807
03:18:37,500 --> 03:18:41,980
It'll be so much harder to accomplish my work if I'm detected or eaten.

2808
03:18:43,020 --> 03:18:43,580
Where are you?

2809
03:18:44,020 --> 03:18:44,900
These are dangerous feasts.

2810
03:18:44,920 --> 03:19:19,180
young one not for a casual wondering what task you sees you brave them a treacherous quest but a crucial one upon the last wish my father i'm taking up the study of these wild caves sometimes i keep forgetting that i can talk to so i read up lines that i'm supposed to be one seeing these fields still display life and growth even as the lines around a road to dust there's a lot of harmony here that loots the great waste above and the dry I marrow beside what time and study I shall uncover why.

2811
03:19:20,660 --> 03:19:21,020
See here?

2812
03:19:21,320 --> 03:19:22,240
This old statue.

2813
03:19:22,780 --> 03:19:25,000
I've just been thinking long on it.

2814
03:19:25,500 --> 03:19:29,480
What clue am I supposed to hold?

2815
03:19:30,660 --> 03:19:33,560
The clawwork seems beyond the other structures throughout those caves.

2816
03:19:34,120 --> 03:19:37,460
Oh, what she, I wonder, deserves such a refined remembrance.

2817
03:19:38,380 --> 03:19:42,160
Hers is a form of a dancer, and the craft is indeed requisite.

2818
03:19:42,640 --> 03:19:44,620
There must once have been more to these ants.

2819
03:19:44,920 --> 03:20:11,440
the hauntings smitten are their shells and mines okay it's all the lore conversing is a pleasure but must return to my observate observance try not to leave too much a trail when you leave please okay that that was just lore i did all of that for lore yeah i know i can see it from the hornet but like sometimes it's like really like you know gamers don't look up you know

2820
03:20:16,240 --> 03:20:17,920
My chair!

2821
03:20:18,860 --> 03:20:20,020
Oh my god!

2822
03:20:20,460 --> 03:20:21,540
I never learned.

2823
03:20:24,720 --> 03:20:28,380
I was like, surely it'll be different this time.

2824
03:20:31,200 --> 03:20:32,640
How do I break it?

2825
03:20:34,840 --> 03:20:37,960
I just want to sit on a chair.

2826
03:20:46,380 --> 03:20:47,160
It's not...

2827
03:20:47,160 --> 03:20:47,460
Ah!

2828
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:49,720
It's not...

2829
03:20:49,740 --> 03:20:51,740
fit I

2830
03:21:00,700 --> 03:21:02,840
Cannot sit on chair

2831
03:21:06,500 --> 03:21:13,500
My feet hurt Feet hurt Be hurt one chair

2832
03:21:17,600 --> 03:21:22,620
Oh now I can't do shit Oh my god now.

2833
03:21:22,880 --> 03:21:24,880
I just need wall dash.

2834
03:21:25,620 --> 03:21:31,840
I can't do anything up there Oh my god, I went up there For no reason.

2835
03:21:34,460 --> 03:21:37,380
I'm lost as fuck right now.

2836
03:21:42,890 --> 03:21:43,730
I feel like I went...

2837
03:21:43,730 --> 03:21:45,870
Oh my god, I had to go to the other area.

2838
03:21:49,380 --> 03:21:51,900
Okay, try sitting on that chair now.

2839
03:21:53,740 --> 03:21:55,020
All that Pogo.

2840
03:21:58,460 --> 03:22:01,340
All that Pogo for nothing?

2841
03:22:06,120 --> 03:22:07,620
I'm so sad.

2842
03:22:11,660 --> 03:22:12,960
Just for lore.

2843
03:22:16,760 --> 03:22:18,360
Oh, that Pogo for lore.

2844
03:22:25,500 --> 03:22:26,720
I'm so sad.

2845
03:22:26,840 --> 03:22:28,940
I worked so hard for that area too.

2846
03:22:35,380 --> 03:22:36,700
I don't know where to go then.

2847
03:22:37,020 --> 03:22:38,960
I feel like I did everything over there.

2848
03:22:40,080 --> 03:22:40,500
Yeah.

2849
03:22:41,480 --> 03:22:42,480
Where do I go?

2850
03:22:48,310 --> 03:22:48,910
Huh.

2851
03:22:53,900 --> 03:22:54,500
Wait.

2852
03:22:55,680 --> 03:22:56,560
What the fuck?

2853
03:23:00,660 --> 03:23:03,200
Why is my cocoon all the way up there?

2854
03:23:06,140 --> 03:23:08,200
Do I have a...

2855
03:23:09,160 --> 03:23:09,880
Oh, I do.

2856
03:23:10,420 --> 03:23:11,660
I should... Wait, how much is that?

2857
03:23:11,720 --> 03:23:11,920
20.

2858
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:13,300
Okay, let's grab a tool.

2859
03:23:14,280 --> 03:23:15,360
Maybe a tool would help.

2860
03:23:21,580 --> 03:23:22,060
Cool.

2861
03:23:22,340 --> 03:23:23,740
Glad that didn't hit me.

2862
03:23:25,480 --> 03:23:25,860
Sit.

2863
03:23:27,220 --> 03:23:27,640
Alright.

2864
03:23:34,060 --> 03:23:35,300
Alright, we go.

2865
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:37,760
Let's go back to the forge daughter.

2866
03:23:40,670 --> 03:23:41,690
It's fine.

2867
03:23:41,970 --> 03:23:42,730
My feats...

2868
03:23:43,630 --> 03:23:45,750
My featsy can take it.

2869
03:23:47,290 --> 03:23:47,490
Ow.

2870
03:23:50,770 --> 03:23:51,390
That's fine.

2871
03:23:52,730 --> 03:23:53,290
That's fine.

2872
03:23:54,110 --> 03:23:54,890
Because I have Fwen!

2873
03:23:56,450 --> 03:23:59,670
I'm purposely tanking everything, because I have Fwen.

2874
03:24:04,700 --> 03:24:06,340
Where's the Forge daughter?

2875
03:24:06,780 --> 03:24:07,760
Where does she live?

2876
03:24:08,100 --> 03:24:09,060
Down here, right?

2877
03:24:10,580 --> 03:24:11,620
Yeah, no.

2878
03:24:12,640 --> 03:24:14,500
She lives down...

2879
03:24:14,500 --> 03:24:15,020
Yeah.

2880
03:24:23,020 --> 03:24:24,220
Where did she live?

2881
03:24:25,340 --> 03:24:27,020
Just give me a second try.

2882
03:24:27,040 --> 03:24:28,220
I don't remember where she... Oh, there.

2883
03:24:28,700 --> 03:24:28,880
There.

2884
03:24:29,420 --> 03:24:32,860
I don't have the thing where, like, you know how they're like, oh.

2885
03:24:36,880 --> 03:24:37,360
Uh...

2886
03:24:40,280 --> 03:24:41,100
Or is it here?

2887
03:24:41,140 --> 03:24:41,860
Oh, there she is.

2888
03:24:43,020 --> 03:24:43,780
That's fine.

2889
03:24:45,840 --> 03:24:47,280
You met the workers?

2890
03:24:48,420 --> 03:24:49,220
wound up.

2891
03:24:49,540 --> 03:24:54,320
They still work at their cash in a simple way, but they're useless for conversation.

2892
03:24:55,120 --> 03:24:56,220
It's only ourselves.

2893
03:24:56,740 --> 03:24:59,120
A young fellow with my sense left.

2894
03:24:59,980 --> 03:25:00,120
Oh.

2895
03:25:03,840 --> 03:25:07,220
The behavior of your fellow workers has seen similar agitations upon the roads.

2896
03:25:07,660 --> 03:25:11,140
These dogs are not alone in the strangeness of their occupants.

2897
03:25:12,040 --> 03:25:22,360
There's odd behavior to be sure that not for Bilo and us to know, Ice is our busy work and we keep to ourselves.

2898
03:25:23,360 --> 03:25:31,720
Whatever the goings of the world outside, no bother to us as long as our craft can continue.

2899
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:36,260
Keep well, Forge daughter.

2900
03:25:36,640 --> 03:25:38,500
I shall return if I require your aid.

2901
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:41,080
Yes or no?

2902
03:25:41,900 --> 03:25:46,880
Either is fine by me as long as the craft continues.

2903
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:48,820
Please!

2904
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:52,880
I want to- Oh, shop!

2905
03:25:53,040 --> 03:25:55,440
Okay, I was like, why am I talking to you?

2906
03:25:55,720 --> 03:25:56,880
Okay, here we go.

2907
03:26:00,020 --> 03:26:00,380
Okay.

2908
03:26:01,520 --> 03:26:04,380
Wait, I don't even have the rocks to upgrade!

2909
03:26:07,940 --> 03:26:09,060
I forgot!

2910
03:26:11,080 --> 03:26:14,900
Oh my god, I don't even have the rocks to upgrade this.

2911
03:26:15,500 --> 03:26:17,720
God fucking, damn it!

2912
03:26:20,800 --> 03:26:21,960
I'm a little lost.

2913
03:26:22,100 --> 03:26:24,500
Okay, I'm going to look at my big map now.

2914
03:26:26,900 --> 03:26:31,340
I'm trying to remember which one were gates that were locked and which one we can parkour.

2915
03:26:33,940 --> 03:26:35,680
Okay, let's retrace our steps.

2916
03:26:35,820 --> 03:26:37,080
It's Metrovania time.

2917
03:26:41,390 --> 03:26:45,750
Well, I already have max shards right now, so I can't...

2918
03:26:47,050 --> 03:26:47,930
Which area?

2919
03:26:48,190 --> 03:27:02,690
We can't... No, we can't go to the right because um it's locked i remember we got backtracked there's some area in the morrow there's stuff it's it's like basically locked up but i know we did everything in hunters march

2920
03:27:09,760 --> 03:27:15,340
yeah because they don't they don't show like they don't show like what's locked up on the map

2921
03:27:19,730 --> 03:27:27,920
like that's like why i'm like hello it's time hey who's a good boy okay bone marrow

2922
03:27:37,450 --> 03:27:57,320
okay maybe there's like something i could buy with the hippies maybe oh my god thank god this is what we needed i'm so sick and tired Oh, and I can buy a shard.

2923
03:27:57,520 --> 03:27:59,100
Wait, I can buy a shard right now.

2924
03:28:00,540 --> 03:28:01,880
Are you serious?

2925
03:28:02,260 --> 03:28:04,400
It takes up the compass slot?

2926
03:28:04,800 --> 03:28:06,780
There's no fucking way.

2927
03:28:08,700 --> 03:28:10,240
Oh, wait, I have memory locket.

2928
03:28:10,380 --> 03:28:13,000
Oh, that's what the memory locket... Okay, I can.

2929
03:28:14,880 --> 03:28:15,540
Thank God.

2930
03:28:15,600 --> 03:28:17,680
Okay, okay, that's what the memory lockets are for.

2931
03:28:19,320 --> 03:28:20,160
Oh, my God.

2932
03:28:20,260 --> 03:28:20,680
Thank God.

2933
03:28:20,800 --> 03:28:22,380
I was gonna freak out.

2934
03:28:25,880 --> 03:28:27,340
I was gonna say, there's no way.

2935
03:28:27,400 --> 03:28:29,420
I cannot get rid of the fucking compass.

2936
03:28:29,880 --> 03:28:30,200
I...

2937
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:33,460
There's no fucking way.

2938
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:34,840
They cannot do this to me.

2939
03:28:36,400 --> 03:28:37,400
Oh, wait, she's gone.

2940
03:28:40,360 --> 03:28:44,540
I was gonna freak out if I had to take away the compass.

2941
03:28:46,720 --> 03:28:48,420
Okay, we go...

2942
03:28:48,420 --> 03:28:51,000
The tram, and then down.

2943
03:28:51,180 --> 03:28:51,660
Or up.

2944
03:28:51,800 --> 03:28:53,480
I don't know if we could go up, but we'll try.

2945
03:28:55,880 --> 03:28:58,080
This angry Doki, exactly.

2946
03:29:00,380 --> 03:29:00,740
Damn!

2947
03:29:02,100 --> 03:29:02,460
Adidas!

2948
03:29:09,720 --> 03:29:12,200
The most lost Doki yet.

2949
03:29:15,020 --> 03:29:16,640
I like that I can run.

2950
03:29:20,050 --> 03:29:20,470
Okay.

2951
03:29:24,650 --> 03:29:26,210
Wait, where is it?

2952
03:29:27,650 --> 03:29:28,750
Okay, it's above.

2953
03:29:28,930 --> 03:29:32,870
Okay, we're gonna check out above if we can access that area now.

2954
03:29:33,390 --> 03:29:34,670
Because I don't know.

2955
03:29:37,890 --> 03:29:39,410
I'm always lost.

2956
03:29:40,970 --> 03:29:41,530
Okay, it's here.

2957
03:29:43,270 --> 03:29:43,950
No, that's...

2958
03:29:43,950 --> 03:29:45,530
Yeah, I need a wall ride for that.

2959
03:29:47,130 --> 03:29:48,850
Okay, I can't access this.

2960
03:29:50,290 --> 03:29:51,050
Now I know...

2961
03:29:51,050 --> 03:29:51,290
Ow.

2962
03:29:52,510 --> 03:29:54,810
Okay, and then there's one below me, too.

2963
03:29:56,610 --> 03:29:57,810
Is that a...

2964
03:29:57,810 --> 03:29:58,270
No.

2965
03:30:00,310 --> 03:30:01,390
It's this way.

2966
03:30:04,110 --> 03:30:04,670
Ah!

2967
03:30:04,970 --> 03:30:05,450
Ah!

2968
03:30:06,330 --> 03:30:06,810
Stupid whore!

2969
03:30:10,410 --> 03:30:12,850
Okay, I can add eat us, or when.

2970
03:30:17,640 --> 03:30:21,720
Your goddamn swords aren't gonna protect you from my sword.

2971
03:30:21,920 --> 03:30:22,880
My sword's bigger.

2972
03:30:23,700 --> 03:30:24,600
Oh hey, I didn't see this.

2973
03:30:24,720 --> 03:30:25,280
Oh, nice.

2974
03:30:27,260 --> 03:30:30,300
That's right, my sword's bigger, bitch.

2975
03:30:33,520 --> 03:30:34,640
Okay, this way.

2976
03:30:35,360 --> 03:30:36,060
Yep, it's locked.

2977
03:30:36,160 --> 03:30:37,000
God damn it.

2978
03:30:37,040 --> 03:30:38,340
Everything is locked.

2979
03:30:39,660 --> 03:30:42,240
I assume that one is also like...

2980
03:30:46,900 --> 03:30:48,620
Everything is just locked!

2981
03:30:53,820 --> 03:30:56,440
Okay, there's... I think that is also a wall, right?

2982
03:30:57,140 --> 03:30:57,960
Is it?

2983
03:30:58,500 --> 03:30:58,760
Yep.

2984
03:30:59,000 --> 03:30:59,280
God!

2985
03:31:04,740 --> 03:31:07,640
Okay, there's stuff to the right of deep docks.

2986
03:31:11,890 --> 03:31:14,110
I assume like... No, there's one more area.

2987
03:31:17,910 --> 03:31:18,470
Oops.

2988
03:31:19,610 --> 03:31:21,270
I'll farm this for HP.

2989
03:31:22,250 --> 03:31:22,610
Alright, oh.

2990
03:31:23,470 --> 03:31:24,170
Collect it.

2991
03:31:24,310 --> 03:31:24,610
Nice.

2992
03:31:26,190 --> 03:31:26,750
Okay.

2993
03:31:28,150 --> 03:31:30,350
Can we go to far fields?

2994
03:31:30,970 --> 03:31:32,830
I know this one is locked, too.

2995
03:31:33,550 --> 03:31:34,110
Yeah, it's locked.

2996
03:31:34,190 --> 03:31:35,130
They're all locked!

2997
03:31:37,450 --> 03:31:37,730
Alright.

2998
03:31:38,170 --> 03:31:39,070
I mean...

2999
03:31:39,070 --> 03:31:41,690
I remember that door was also locked.

3000
03:31:42,810 --> 03:31:43,930
I'll look at it again.

3001
03:31:44,790 --> 03:31:45,370
Oh, shit.

3002
03:31:46,830 --> 03:31:47,490
Speed ride.

3003
03:31:48,530 --> 03:31:49,590
I'll check again.

3004
03:31:49,610 --> 03:31:51,490
I'm pretty sure that one's locked

3005
03:31:58,470 --> 03:32:13,990
Wait, okay, I have enough I found it, I bought a stone I didn't buy the stone God, I thought I bought it I thought I bought it, never mind I don't need it I legitimately thought I bought it

3006
03:32:18,670 --> 03:32:28,070
Yeah, this one I needed the key I don't have the key Okay, so this one, I need a key All right.

3007
03:32:28,410 --> 03:32:32,590
The only way I could go is the place I killed the child.

3008
03:32:34,690 --> 03:32:37,050
I need to go to the place where I killed her.

3009
03:32:37,990 --> 03:32:39,490
Or, like, hurt her a little bit.

3010
03:32:40,170 --> 03:32:42,310
That's the only place I could think to go.

3011
03:32:43,430 --> 03:32:44,130
It's here.

3012
03:32:52,020 --> 03:32:53,760
Wait, there was a key at the shop?

3013
03:32:54,880 --> 03:32:56,100
Wait, was there?

3014
03:32:56,500 --> 03:32:58,040
But does that open that key?

3015
03:32:59,720 --> 03:33:01,400
Does it open that specific?

3016
03:33:01,460 --> 03:33:02,140
Oh, my God.

3017
03:33:02,640 --> 03:33:03,620
Back to...

3018
03:33:03,620 --> 03:33:04,960
It's backtracking time.

3019
03:33:07,520 --> 03:33:09,680
It was five, but I'm not made of money.

3020
03:33:10,940 --> 03:33:12,120
It's 500.

3021
03:33:12,920 --> 03:33:14,820
I feel like that doesn't progress.

3022
03:33:15,160 --> 03:33:16,020
If it's like...

3023
03:33:16,740 --> 03:33:17,040
Usually...

3024
03:33:17,880 --> 03:33:27,000
I feel like usually if it's like something you have to buy, it doesn't really progress the story, I feel like.

3025
03:33:27,840 --> 03:33:28,380
Yeah.

3026
03:33:30,120 --> 03:33:32,620
Yeah, if it costs that much, it seems like an option.

3027
03:33:32,640 --> 03:33:33,440
optional thing.

3028
03:33:36,600 --> 03:33:37,520
Okay, we're back here.

3029
03:33:37,620 --> 03:33:38,340
The far fields.

3030
03:33:39,740 --> 03:33:41,260
Maybe we'll figure out how...

3031
03:33:41,260 --> 03:33:42,100
Maybe it's here.

3032
03:33:45,480 --> 03:33:45,900
Yeah.

3033
03:33:47,340 --> 03:33:47,840
I...

3034
03:33:47,840 --> 03:33:50,720
I gave up here because, like...

3035
03:33:51,740 --> 03:33:55,640
I felt like I needed, like, wall dash to do a lot of these.

3036
03:34:01,730 --> 03:34:04,830
Yeah, but for the waterways, I had a lot of money.

3037
03:34:04,890 --> 03:34:06,350
I don't have fucking shit.

3038
03:34:06,410 --> 03:34:23,040
here and I don't have the map okay I'm gonna ignore these little bugs oh shit

3039
03:34:27,800 --> 03:34:38,620
okay when I think I have to fight these guys that hits me

3040
03:34:46,580 --> 03:34:47,960
Okay, he'll come back up, right?

3041
03:34:48,720 --> 03:34:49,000
No.

3042
03:34:50,020 --> 03:34:50,460
Hello.

3043
03:34:52,260 --> 03:34:53,100
Oh, my god.

3044
03:34:53,280 --> 03:34:54,840
Okay, now you come back up.

3045
03:34:55,600 --> 03:34:57,920
Okay, you're such a bitch.

3046
03:34:59,380 --> 03:35:01,040
I just want to summon him.

3047
03:35:07,790 --> 03:35:08,270
Fuen!

3048
03:35:09,610 --> 03:35:10,390
Okay, I hope...

3049
03:35:10,390 --> 03:35:11,670
I don't know if this resets this.

3050
03:35:11,710 --> 03:35:12,410
Okay, it does not.

3051
03:35:12,510 --> 03:35:12,910
Thank God.

3052
03:35:14,370 --> 03:35:14,930
That's right.

3053
03:35:14,990 --> 03:35:16,230
No light for you.

3054
03:35:19,070 --> 03:35:19,750
There you go.

3055
03:35:20,110 --> 03:35:20,870
Okay, let's see.

3056
03:35:22,490 --> 03:35:24,310
And so I can figure this out.

3057
03:35:28,240 --> 03:35:28,680
Oh my god.

3058
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:30,540
I assume I have to jump from that.

3059
03:35:38,410 --> 03:35:39,310
Okay, I have...

3060
03:35:39,310 --> 03:35:40,810
Maybe I have to do like a running thing.

3061
03:35:41,650 --> 03:35:42,850
And then...

3062
03:35:42,850 --> 03:35:44,810
Yeah, I knew it.

3063
03:35:46,630 --> 03:35:47,150
Cheeky.

3064
03:35:47,370 --> 03:35:48,370
That's so cheeky.

3065
03:35:53,930 --> 03:35:55,070
Oh my god.

3066
03:35:59,660 --> 03:36:01,700
I have to do like a wiggle jump.

3067
03:36:03,700 --> 03:36:04,740
There we go.

3068
03:36:05,640 --> 03:36:06,760
Oh, man.

3069
03:36:07,440 --> 03:36:11,840
The parkour here is a lot more complicated than before.

3070
03:36:16,290 --> 03:36:19,090
I think, like, because we had so much, like, assist.

3071
03:36:22,290 --> 03:36:22,790
Oh, my God.

3072
03:36:22,850 --> 03:36:23,470
I didn't think you would.

3073
03:36:25,570 --> 03:36:26,330
Oh, nice.

3074
03:36:29,610 --> 03:36:31,430
My money now.

3075
03:36:34,650 --> 03:36:36,850
They, like, they, like, babyed us.

3076
03:36:36,870 --> 03:36:39,630
so hard with like all the stuff they did.

3077
03:36:40,870 --> 03:36:46,410
I think they they definitely babyed us more.

3078
03:36:47,070 --> 03:36:52,910
Silk saw is like, Hollow Knight was like elementary school and then Silk saw is like going to college.

3079
03:36:59,590 --> 03:37:01,190
Like we just go straight to college.

3080
03:37:07,090 --> 03:37:09,810
No, Hollow Knight is like going to kindergarten and then like

3081
03:37:13,900 --> 03:37:17,340
and then now we're like paying our college tuition

3082
03:37:23,960 --> 03:37:31,840

3084
03:37:52,440 --> 03:37:53,720
Why didn't you going?

3085
03:37:54,960 --> 03:37:56,160
Oh, there's a tram.

3086
03:38:00,430 --> 03:38:02,130
Expensive ass bench.

3087
03:38:05,670 --> 03:38:07,410
My doggy is here.

3088
03:38:13,400 --> 03:38:14,900
Get over here, boy.

3089
03:38:15,800 --> 03:38:16,380
Eita!

3090
03:38:16,840 --> 03:38:17,280
Eita!

3091
03:38:19,980 --> 03:38:20,860
Yay!

3092
03:38:22,320 --> 03:38:24,060
Alright, I called you here for no reason.

3093
03:38:30,180 --> 03:38:32,520
Thanks for coming over.

3094
03:38:34,360 --> 03:38:36,300
There was no reason for you to be here.

3095
03:38:36,820 --> 03:38:38,860
I just wanted to say hello.

3096
03:38:45,060 --> 03:38:46,640
I ding-dong ditched.

3097
03:38:47,860 --> 03:38:51,140
Sharika, you look well at home in these wilds.

3098
03:38:51,960 --> 03:39:02,840
Poshanka, the scoundrel field office, offers many paths and much combat To leap from vantage upon the red shells or to meet them face front with rings ready.

3099
03:39:03,640 --> 03:39:05,120
These are decisions to live for.

3100
03:39:06,500 --> 03:39:12,160
I am much surprised those soft pilgrims ever safely climbed the scorched and savage place.

3101
03:39:13,740 --> 03:39:13,980
Alright.

3102
03:39:14,520 --> 03:39:14,900
Okay.

3103
03:39:16,940 --> 03:39:19,740
Okay, wait, I have...

3104
03:39:19,740 --> 03:39:20,320
Don't worry.

3105
03:39:21,680 --> 03:39:23,080
Don't worry, I have this.

3106
03:39:23,900 --> 03:39:25,140
I gotta get these out.

3107
03:39:25,700 --> 03:39:26,260
I might as well.

3108
03:39:27,360 --> 03:39:38,000
all the beads out so I can also afford the vendors I think yeah I need the vendors I'm so lost without it nice all right now

3109
03:39:46,340 --> 03:39:47,380
get here

3110
03:39:52,080 --> 03:39:56,020
what the fuck is how do I get out of here that's the question

3111
03:40:00,800 --> 03:40:02,160
Oh, this...

3112
03:40:02,160 --> 03:40:05,360
Oh, this looks like a boss fight area.

3113
03:40:07,880 --> 03:40:08,600
Oh, no.

3114
03:40:09,220 --> 03:40:10,660
What do these do?

3115
03:40:14,120 --> 03:40:16,660
Because I don't jump higher with them.

3116
03:40:17,560 --> 03:40:19,400
Like, sorry, I was testing something else.

3117
03:40:20,700 --> 03:40:22,900
I feel like...

3118
03:40:22,900 --> 03:40:23,460
Hmm.

3119
03:40:24,320 --> 03:40:26,440
I wish I knew what this does.

3120
03:40:26,440 --> 03:40:28,740
Maybe it'll tell me later.

3121
03:40:28,840 --> 03:40:30,020
It'll definitely tell me later.

3122
03:40:31,220 --> 03:40:33,700
But it's still like, you know, what does it do?

3123
03:40:33,940 --> 03:40:34,660
What's this?

3124
03:40:38,040 --> 03:40:39,080
What the fuck?

3125
03:40:43,610 --> 03:40:45,710
Yeah, it has to be for later.

3126
03:40:53,520 --> 03:40:56,680
It's like, I don't know what else it could be right now.

3127
03:41:02,290 --> 03:41:04,130
God, I hope I grab him upgrade quick.

3128
03:41:06,990 --> 03:41:08,010
Oh, there is a creep.

3129
03:41:08,030 --> 03:41:09,070
Crazy Cultist!

3130
03:41:10,250 --> 03:41:12,610
Oh, my rosary beads are flying up!

3131
03:41:13,410 --> 03:41:14,230
Wait, what's this?

3132
03:41:15,750 --> 03:41:16,910
Wait, what are you?

3133
03:41:17,030 --> 03:41:17,210
Oh.

3134
03:41:18,290 --> 03:41:20,110
What the fuck is that?

3135
03:41:20,770 --> 03:41:22,590
What the fuck was that?

3136
03:41:24,670 --> 03:41:27,030
They're like, yeah, they're like roly-poly.

3137
03:41:31,280 --> 03:41:32,460
Into the lava.

3138
03:41:35,580 --> 03:41:36,880
Alright, let me... when?

3139
03:41:41,600 --> 03:41:42,040
Okay.

3140
03:41:45,520 --> 03:42:11,260
he's like a little all right okay there's gonna be ability where i can use the loops not yet ow okay i i don't know i thought i don't know i i don't know what i thought was gonna happen i i don't know

3141
03:42:16,480 --> 03:42:19,220
I thought something different will happen, okay?

3142
03:42:20,340 --> 03:42:23,140
I thought it opened like a secret passageway.

3143
03:42:29,240 --> 03:42:32,520
It looked like it opened a secret passageway, okay?

3144
03:42:36,640 --> 03:42:39,140
Okay, there's a mysterious door here.

3145
03:42:39,840 --> 03:42:41,800
That looks like a boss fight door.

3146
03:42:43,900 --> 03:42:45,780
Secret pathway to respawn.

3147
03:42:47,700 --> 03:42:50,120
A pathway is a pathway.

3148
03:42:57,780 --> 03:42:59,660
When you roll out, wait?

3149
03:42:59,880 --> 03:42:59,880
Oh.

3150
03:43:03,760 --> 03:43:03,940
Oh.

3151
03:43:09,520 --> 03:43:09,980
Goodbye.

3152
03:43:15,050 --> 03:43:17,070
If it works, it works.

3153
03:43:27,410 --> 03:43:29,750
Sometimes you gotta commit a little murder.

3154
03:43:32,810 --> 03:43:34,650
Holy shit, I don't even know where I am.

3155
03:43:38,870 --> 03:43:39,230
What?

3156
03:43:40,070 --> 03:43:40,850
This is a shortcut.

3157
03:43:42,090 --> 03:43:43,670
Yeah, I see it.

3158
03:43:43,890 --> 03:43:45,890
I was like, that destroys a hole down there.

3159
03:43:49,720 --> 03:43:51,360
And another shortcut.

3160
03:43:51,800 --> 03:43:52,560
Oh, never mind.

3161
03:43:52,800 --> 03:43:54,660
I already have $400.

3162
03:44:00,340 --> 03:44:00,700
Yay!

3163
03:44:01,720 --> 03:44:03,060
I'm robbing the...

3164
03:44:04,400 --> 03:44:07,800
I should say that out loud.

3165
03:44:08,420 --> 03:44:08,980
In game!

3166
03:44:09,540 --> 03:44:10,580
In game!

3167
03:44:13,240 --> 03:44:14,040
Just a...

3168
03:44:14,060 --> 03:44:29,260
you know it's in game oh wow black fire thank you for the super chat thank you thank you oh thank you five gift of ships thank you thank you is that everything

3169
03:44:36,070 --> 03:44:38,790
was that everything i'm trying to think

3170
03:44:44,340 --> 03:44:50,780
there's definitely gonna be a lot of backtracking i can tell where does this go okay it goes back.

3171
03:44:52,660 --> 03:44:54,200
Yeah, that's the hole that he fell through.

3172
03:44:54,960 --> 03:44:58,420
I'm gonna backtrack here just to be sure.

3173
03:45:06,400 --> 03:45:06,520
Ow.

3174
03:45:07,140 --> 03:45:08,360
Get in that spike.

3175
03:45:10,380 --> 03:45:12,120
The joys of Metrovania.

3176
03:45:15,560 --> 03:45:22,740
That's the only downside for me because no one has this game just released today so no one knows where to go.

3177
03:45:23,720 --> 03:45:25,440
Nobody knows where to go.

3178
03:45:30,700 --> 03:45:32,760
I think I went everywhere.

3179
03:45:33,460 --> 03:45:35,840
Nobody can backseat me now.

3180
03:45:37,200 --> 03:45:39,740
Now I'm experiencing the real Metrovania.

3181
03:45:44,790 --> 03:45:46,030
Oh, where's this?

3182
03:45:46,810 --> 03:45:47,110
Hello?

3183
03:45:48,150 --> 03:45:48,930
Oh, I get a chair.

3184
03:45:49,270 --> 03:45:49,890
Yay, chair.

3185
03:45:51,170 --> 03:45:52,010
Hello, babe.

3186
03:45:52,390 --> 03:45:54,150
Well, aren't you a sight?

3187
03:45:54,450 --> 03:45:55,670
No, don't tell me.

3188
03:45:56,090 --> 03:45:57,170
Where's all this to come?

3189
03:45:59,610 --> 03:46:03,110
Boys, your form, are you hunted, pursued?

3190
03:46:04,670 --> 03:46:07,110
The citadel will see a fine prize in you.

3191
03:46:07,850 --> 03:46:09,430
It's as you say, madam.

3192
03:46:09,810 --> 03:46:11,550
Veiled bugs brought me to your land.

3193
03:46:12,070 --> 03:46:14,050
I seek them now for answers.

3194
03:46:14,970 --> 03:46:15,150
Ha!

3195
03:46:15,610 --> 03:46:16,570
Fierce too.

3196
03:46:17,210 --> 03:46:18,510
There are bleak times.

3197
03:46:19,270 --> 03:46:22,850
But powerful stray like you could certainly cause some change.

3198
03:46:24,610 --> 03:46:27,770
Well then, I have no love for that holy cast.

3199
03:46:29,810 --> 03:46:30,850
scaling state.

3200
03:46:31,530 --> 03:46:34,570
If you're seeking to settle a score, perhaps I can lend some aid.

3201
03:46:35,210 --> 03:46:41,190
If you're planning to send from these little fields, you'll be needing some lift, and I'm just the bug to help.

3202
03:46:42,130 --> 03:46:43,790
Head for the caves beyond my home.

3203
03:46:44,310 --> 03:46:47,330
The bugs within produce a marvelous spine.

3204
03:46:47,810 --> 03:46:49,650
Flexible, yet strong.

3205
03:46:50,210 --> 03:46:51,650
Collect those spines.

3206
03:46:51,890 --> 03:46:55,630
Return to me, and I'll soon... Oh, this is where I can fly!

3207
03:46:56,390 --> 03:46:58,130
I'm gonna learn how to fly!

3208
03:46:58,330 --> 03:46:59,110
She can fly!

3209
03:47:00,590 --> 03:47:22,530
It's like when elephants can fly I'll soon have your old cloak transformed into something more buoyant Okay Lexile Lexile spine Ooh, you have to kill A smart choice, get out here and gather those spines and best you be quick about it As nice it is at the company,

3210
03:47:22,950 --> 03:47:31,910

3211
03:47:32,130 --> 03:47:34,110
What the fuck is a hoker?

3212
03:47:37,130 --> 03:47:37,690
Far fields.

3213
03:47:38,230 --> 03:47:39,030
Where is that?

3214
03:47:42,170 --> 03:47:43,170
What is that?

3215
03:47:50,760 --> 03:47:52,280
Those flying things?

3216
03:47:55,840 --> 03:47:56,580
These guys?

3217
03:47:58,940 --> 03:47:59,940
Are you hokers?

3218
03:48:00,180 --> 03:48:00,460
No.

3219
03:48:01,640 --> 03:48:03,380
What do they look like?

3220
03:48:03,740 --> 03:48:04,520
These guys?

3221
03:48:09,010 --> 03:48:11,010
What is it those guys?

3222
03:48:13,710 --> 03:48:15,550
Or is it these guys?

3223
03:48:19,000 --> 03:48:20,540
Oh, it's these!

3224
03:48:22,780 --> 03:48:23,140
Right?

3225
03:48:26,620 --> 03:48:27,180
Oh!

3226
03:48:27,780 --> 03:48:28,340
Oh!

3227
03:48:29,980 --> 03:48:31,040
I can just break it!

3228
03:48:31,120 --> 03:48:31,340
Okay.

3229
03:48:32,400 --> 03:48:33,760
That's actually convenient.

3230
03:48:33,940 --> 03:48:35,280
Oh my god, I'm actually...

3231
03:48:35,280 --> 03:48:35,880
No, that's fine.

3232
03:48:36,060 --> 03:48:36,200
Right.

3233
03:48:37,100 --> 03:48:38,540
How much do I have to...

3234
03:48:38,540 --> 03:48:40,740
Okay, I can just farm the spikes.

Ow.

3238
03:49:20,560 --> 03:49:22,200
I should bring in these guys, this too.

3239
03:49:26,370 --> 03:49:28,110
Yeah, because I know they...

3240
03:49:31,840 --> 03:49:32,480
Nice.

3241
03:49:33,640 --> 03:49:34,600
I poop a little.

3242
03:49:35,540 --> 03:49:36,220
There you go.

3243
03:49:37,060 --> 03:49:37,660
Oh, shit.

3244
03:49:38,740 --> 03:49:39,060
Alright.

3245
03:49:40,460 --> 03:49:41,100
Ow!

3246
03:49:43,020 --> 03:49:43,660
Nice.

3247
03:49:44,020 --> 03:49:44,660

3248
03:49:49,380 --> 03:49:49,940
Alright.

3249
03:49:50,980 --> 03:49:52,320
And then there's one here.

3250
03:49:55,220 --> 03:49:55,780
Okay.

3251
03:49:59,410 --> 03:49:59,970
Alright.

3252
03:50:02,290 --> 03:50:03,570
And then one more.

3253
03:50:03,850 --> 03:50:04,050
Ow.

3254
03:50:04,430 --> 03:50:05,410
I keep forgetting he does that.

3255
03:50:05,590 --> 03:50:06,550
The last one too.

3256
03:50:08,430 --> 03:50:09,230
Oh my gosh.

3257
03:50:09,330 --> 03:50:10,950
If only let...

3258
03:50:10,950 --> 03:50:11,330
Alright.

3259

Got another one.

3260
03:50:12,770 --> 03:50:13,330
Wait, what?

3261
03:50:14,950 --> 03:50:15,710
Oh, okay.

3262
03:50:15,770 --> 03:50:17,310
I got a little dash attack too.

3263
03:50:17,830 --> 03:50:18,110
Alright.

3264
03:50:18,610 --> 03:50:19,570

I'm teaching you guys the most efficient way to farm, too!

3271
03:51:10,160 --> 03:51:10,920
Oh, I got it.

3272
03:51:11,620 --> 03:51:12,580
That's pretty fast.

3273
03:51:15,540 --> 03:51:17,320
Alright, now I can fly!

3274
03:51:18,400 --> 03:51:19,080
Thank god.

3275
03:51:19,660 --> 03:51:21,460
I thought I was gonna be, like, stuck in this area.

3276
03:51:23,900 --> 03:51:24,700
I can fly!

3277
03:51:27,700 --> 03:51:28,660
Hello, ma'am.

3278
03:51:29,300 --> 03:51:32,260
Well then, I can tell by the rattling from within your cloak.

3279
03:51:32,500 --> 03:51:34,160
Your hunt was a success!

3280
03:51:34,940 --> 03:51:36,560
It'll kindly pass over the spines.

3281
03:51:36,880 --> 03:51:38,260
I can get to work.

3282
03:51:41,280 --> 03:51:42,960
I believe I can fly.

3283
03:51:45,000 --> 03:51:48,080
I believe I can touch the sky.

3284
03:51:49,320 --> 03:51:50,820
Perfect, these should be more than enough.

3285
03:51:51,340 --> 03:51:55,740
Wait there, just a moment, and we'll soon have you soaring up and away from these lowlands.

3286
03:51:58,660 --> 03:51:59,180
Oh.

3287
03:52:00,380 --> 03:52:00,860
Oh.

3288
03:52:05,040 --> 03:52:07,920
I got the drafter cloak.

3289
03:52:10,420 --> 03:52:12,640
Flare the cloak to ride a strong glide.

3290
03:52:12,800 --> 03:52:13,560
Oh my god, my leg.

3291
03:52:13,800 --> 03:52:15,460
Oh my god, put your clothes on.

3292
03:52:16,340 --> 03:52:18,200
That is fine work.

3293
03:52:18,460 --> 03:52:20,660
See, you're on a vacation.

3294
03:52:21,400 --> 03:52:22,400
Well, yeah, whoa.

3295
03:52:23,160 --> 03:52:25,340
Put your damn clothes back on.

3296
03:52:25,720 --> 03:52:27,800
She's just naked under there.

3297
03:52:28,940 --> 03:52:30,140
You're quite welcome, dear.

3298
03:52:30,600 --> 03:52:31,880
A rare opportunity.

3299
03:52:32,500 --> 03:53:02,860
practice um such intricate sewing in a war so that you would be able to properly appreciate my addiction additions blown away now stray one and do try not to die i rather not have my hard work going away so just a moment dear before you scurry up i'd love to spoil the surprise but curiosity beg me to ask do you know why they pursue you those citadel bugs no certainly no certainly certainty,

3300
03:53:03,140 --> 03:53:05,240
but I have a strong suspicion.

3301
03:53:06,080 --> 03:53:10,100
They help me for my nature, for the silk produced within my seashell.

3302
03:53:11,260 --> 03:53:11,500
Aha!

3303
03:53:12,120 --> 03:53:13,400
Truth, no doubt.

3304
03:53:13,900 --> 03:53:16,920
In Farlum, yours is a rare skill.

3305
03:53:17,380 --> 03:53:19,180
Prize beyond measure.

3306
03:53:19,660 --> 03:53:21,400
The channel won the soul within a thread.

3307
03:53:21,940 --> 03:53:24,460
Soul and silk is separately linked.

3308
03:53:24,780 --> 03:53:28,460
Um, it's silk and soul for like silk song.

3309
03:53:29,740 --> 03:53:32,200
It's a skill almost lost from Farlum.

3310
03:53:32,500 --> 03:53:36,700
Those old weavers shared it, but they're long dead now.

3311
03:53:37,620 --> 03:53:42,420
There's another live in this kingdom that shares my nature, or some part of it.

3312
03:53:43,060 --> 03:53:44,680
I've seen silk similar to my own.

3313
03:53:45,220 --> 03:53:47,920
It snares the shells of those upon the road.

3314
03:53:48,700 --> 03:53:50,800
I've seen it wrapped and possessed them whole.

3315
03:53:51,300 --> 03:53:53,460
There is will within that thread.

3316
03:53:53,980 --> 03:53:57,420
One that seems to come from somewhere above us, a citadel.

3317
03:53:57,760 --> 03:53:58,500
A little bit.

3318
03:53:59,260 --> 03:53:59,560
Hmm.

3319
03:54:00,120 --> 03:54:01,880
Good sharp sense you've got.

3320
03:54:02,500 --> 03:54:06,820
That citadel, all roads to words and all answers waiting.

3321
03:54:07,480 --> 03:54:09,700
And a long climb up there, my dear.

3322
03:54:10,780 --> 03:54:12,820
Now, it's time you get going.

3323
03:54:13,120 --> 03:54:15,580
Your style and your silk sure are fine.

3324
03:54:16,000 --> 03:54:19,520
But stay too long, and you'll only be trouble for me.

3325
03:54:20,500 --> 03:54:21,520
All right, rushed.

3326
03:54:22,400 --> 03:54:22,880
Let's go.

3327
03:54:24,760 --> 03:54:28,600
So there's another half-breed out there.

3328
03:54:29,860 --> 03:54:30,460
Ooh.

3329
03:54:32,500 --> 03:54:33,020
Whoops.

3330
03:54:33,820 --> 03:54:36,120
That's like, just like me apparently.

3331
03:54:37,960 --> 03:54:38,680
Wee.

3332
03:54:39,960 --> 03:54:40,680
Wee.

3333
03:54:49,940 --> 03:54:51,200
And then I float.

3334
03:54:53,120 --> 03:54:54,320
Okay, that's funny.

3335
03:54:55,880 --> 03:54:56,600
I'm dead.

3336
03:54:58,580 --> 03:55:02,280
Because she said that there's like someone like her.

3337
03:55:04,960 --> 03:55:05,520
Wee.

3338
03:55:14,650 --> 03:55:15,710

03:55:16,990 --> 03:55:17,350
Okay.

3340
03:55:17,830 --> 03:55:18,470

I realized I don't have Pogo anymore.

3344
03:55:58,090 --> 03:55:59,670
So I was like, wait a minute.

3345
03:56:00,150 --> 03:56:01,810
How do I do this?

3346
03:56:07,940 --> 03:56:09,040
I can't...

3347
03:56:09,040 --> 03:56:11,560
I can't do an upward shot though.

3348
03:56:14,760 --> 03:56:15,080
What?

3349
03:56:19,070 --> 03:56:20,810
I don't know how to do this.

3350
03:56:23,950 --> 03:56:24,630
Oh.

3351
03:56:24,870 --> 03:56:25,930
Maybe here?

3352
03:56:26,650 --> 03:56:26,690
Oh!

3353
03:56:27,490 --> 03:56:28,110
Okay.

3354
03:56:28,770 --> 03:56:30,250
There we go.

3355
03:56:31,270 --> 03:56:31,950
Wee!

3356
03:56:31,950 --> 03:56:32,270
Okay.

3357
03:56:34,150 --> 03:56:35,430
There we go.

3358
03:56:36,410 --> 03:56:37,530
Oh, it was just...

3359
03:56:37,530 --> 03:56:39,230
Oh, it's for a mask shard.

3360
03:56:41,810 --> 03:56:43,750
Oh, it's different, too.

3361
03:56:44,050 --> 03:56:45,470
The mask is different now.

3362
03:56:46,290 --> 03:56:47,150
Is there any secrets?

3363
03:56:47,990 --> 03:56:49,970
Okay, so that was a pointless area.

3364
03:56:52,850 --> 03:56:53,530
Ah!

3365
03:56:55,270 --> 03:56:57,870

3442
04:16:23,370 --> 04:16:42,230

3443
04:16:42,750 --> 04:16:43,550
And they like stopped.

3444
04:16:43,650 --> 04:16:48,390
I literally was like two minutes to my door, to my lobby door.

3445
04:16:48,930 --> 04:16:52,910
And they stopped me and was like, whoa, how old's your dog?

3446
04:16:53,090 --> 04:16:55,410
And then they asked like 20 questions.

3447
04:16:56,330 --> 04:17:02,830
And I was just like, uh, and then he like was like, he wanted, and then he like spent their petting my...

3448
04:17:02,830 --> 04:17:07,050
I didn't want to be rude or like, you know, I didn't want to be like, no pets, $20.

3449
04:17:07,450 --> 04:17:08,670
And then you want to pet him.

3450
04:17:11,390 --> 04:17:39,410
yeah it was an unskippable cutscene um so then and then he really wanted to like and then dad actually let him pet like let him pet him um and i was like whoa you're letting a man touch you right now that's crazy he ain't no pretty lady um so i was very surprised so i was literally in an unskippable cutscene because he kept petting my dog yeah whoa i paid a pet uh so yeah that's why Like,

3451
04:17:39,470 --> 04:17:41,730
I could have came back, like, five minutes earlier.

3452
04:17:43,470 --> 04:17:45,510
Because he, like, he pees and poops very fast.

3453
04:17:46,110 --> 04:17:46,850
I was nearly...

3454
04:17:46,850 --> 04:17:49,650
If I wasn't in an unskippable cutscene, I'd be back faster.

3455
04:17:50,610 --> 04:17:51,050
Eita!

3456
04:17:51,450 --> 04:17:51,890
Eita!

3457
04:17:53,050 --> 04:17:55,890
I wonder if I'm, like, making good progress compared to everybody.

3458
04:17:56,230 --> 04:17:59,650
Compared to, like, the 800 million other streamers playing this game right now.

3459
04:18:01,750 --> 04:18:03,250
I'm just wondering...

3460
04:18:03,250 --> 04:18:07,050
Am I... I don't even know if I'm making good progress compared to everybody else.

3461
04:18:09,530 --> 04:18:10,410
No clue.

3462
04:18:12,730 --> 04:18:15,850
I mean, I did complete some of the bosses pretty fast.

3463
04:18:18,150 --> 04:18:19,830
I know, like, a lot of streamers.

3464
04:18:20,050 --> 04:18:23,030
Like, literally everybody is playing this game right now.

3465
04:18:23,310 --> 04:18:24,910
Everyone did, like, a hard grind.

3466
04:18:27,350 --> 04:18:32,930
Um, everyone was doing a hard grind to, like, a hard grind of Hollow's Net.

3467
04:18:33,570 --> 04:18:34,110
Wait, is it?

3468
04:18:34,110 --> 04:18:35,290
Oh, I had to go to the ant place.

3469
04:18:35,450 --> 04:18:36,610
I keep forgetting to the ant place.

3470
04:18:39,230 --> 04:19:32,870
platforming is that i i feel like i'm mastering it a bit regarding the um um um the parkour i think this is the filter this fucking park this is the filter when they do the parkour shit for this oh no of course the speedrunners are ahead of me it's because like when you have the po going so ingrained in your head it's it's really weird to like not pogo yeah but I was gone for a little I did did a little intermission yeah I think dive kick is the filter just jump over everything okay

3471
04:19:36,930 --> 04:19:50,490
um we're gonna go to the hunt oh we gotta go down it's like oh shit I know fuck you I'm a full heal Uh, okay, it's this way.

3472
04:19:53,170 --> 04:19:53,690
Wee.

3473
04:19:54,370 --> 04:19:55,210
I'm sorry.

3474
04:19:55,470 --> 04:19:58,190
It's just so stupid when I...

3475
04:19:58,190 --> 04:19:58,910
Wee.

3476
04:20:00,730 --> 04:20:02,590
It makes me so happy.

3477
04:20:04,090 --> 04:20:07,150
I think when you get this, you can skip majority of the parkour.

3478
04:20:07,290 --> 04:20:07,970
Not gonna lie.

3479
04:20:08,610 --> 04:20:10,970
Oh, I should have went from the top part.

3480
04:20:17,470 --> 04:20:17,990
Okay.

3481
04:20:20,650 --> 04:20:21,410
There we go.

3482
04:20:22,130 --> 04:20:25,130
Yeah, the glide saves a lot of time.

3483
04:20:26,470 --> 04:20:28,350
Um, we go straight.

3484
04:20:30,670 --> 04:20:31,370
Wee!

3485
04:20:32,450 --> 04:20:33,150
Ow!

3486
04:20:34,630 --> 04:20:38,350
Oh, whoops.

3487
04:20:38,750 --> 04:20:40,310
Oops, I messed up there.

3488
04:20:42,490 --> 04:20:43,190
Wee!

3489
04:20:48,610 --> 04:20:49,310
Okay.

3490
04:20:51,510 --> 04:20:52,070
There you go.

3491
04:20:53,010 --> 04:20:54,370
I unlocked the glide, yeah.

3492
04:20:57,290 --> 04:20:58,630
I'll just fucking glide.

3493
04:20:58,930 --> 04:20:59,410
Fuck this.

3494
04:21:01,290 --> 04:21:01,850
Wee!

3495
04:21:03,430 --> 04:21:07,270
I don't care enough about this stupid parkour area.

3496
04:21:08,430 --> 04:21:08,770
Oh, I forgot.

3497
04:21:08,970 --> 04:21:09,210
Oh, wait.

3498
04:21:09,970 --> 04:21:10,610
I just want...

3499
04:21:10,610 --> 04:21:13,370
I want to grab this for the thread, the silk.

3500
04:21:13,910 --> 04:21:15,670
Yeah, I love the glide.

3501
04:21:15,850 --> 04:21:17,550
It's just so fucking dumb.

3502
04:21:20,290 --> 04:21:21,470
The glide makes me happy.

3503
04:21:21,570 --> 04:21:21,810
Ah!

3504
04:21:24,590 --> 04:21:25,970
The glide makes me happy.

3505
04:21:25,990 --> 04:21:26,490
happy.

3506
04:21:28,430 --> 04:21:28,430
Yay.

3507
04:21:29,350 --> 04:21:29,990
Oh my god.

3508
04:21:30,210 --> 04:21:30,430
I could do.

3509
04:21:30,890 --> 04:21:31,610
Oh my god.

3510
04:21:31,750 --> 04:21:32,790
I'm so happy.

3511
04:21:33,330 --> 04:21:33,330
I.

3512
04:21:51,970 --> 04:21:58,090
What do I... Oh.

3513
04:21:59,430 --> 04:22:00,030
Imagine.

3514
04:22:00,190 --> 04:22:00,450
Oh.

3515
04:22:01,090 --> 04:22:02,650
Imagine if I could cheese that.

3516
04:22:03,410 --> 04:22:06,290
Imagine if I could cheese that.

3517
04:22:06,910 --> 04:22:09,270
Where the fuck do I go then?

3518
04:22:11,730 --> 04:22:14,130
No, wait a hornet looks up.

3519
04:22:14,350 --> 04:22:15,950
I'm like, okay, wait, wait, wait.

3520
04:22:18,370 --> 04:22:18,850
Happiness.

3521
04:22:19,190 --> 04:22:19,510
God.

3522
04:22:19,890 --> 04:22:21,770
No, I can't cheese it.

3523
04:22:23,890 --> 04:22:25,770
Wait, maybe if I go all the way down.

3524
04:22:30,240 --> 04:22:31,120
Reset the mob.

3525
04:22:31,300 --> 04:22:31,760
Should I do it?

3526
04:22:31,780 --> 04:22:32,520
Should I cheese it?

3527
04:22:32,600 --> 04:22:35,520
I feel like I feel like that's a skip.

3528
04:22:35,700 --> 04:22:46,430
I don't think I'm supposed do that guys okay hello follow me follow me follow me

3529
04:22:51,380 --> 04:22:55,360
oh that's oh whoops

3530
04:22:59,960 --> 04:23:13,420
oh okay wait friend okay wait um no i can't i can't do the skip unless i do this No, I can't.

3531
04:23:14,180 --> 04:23:18,240
I think that would be a really cool skip if I pull it up.

3532
04:23:19,020 --> 04:23:23,420
It's 100% doable, but I can't do it now.

3533
04:23:24,640 --> 04:23:26,980
That would have been a really cool skip, though.

3534
04:23:28,640 --> 04:23:30,000
Oh my god, it's the same trap.

3535
04:23:30,360 --> 04:23:32,700
It's the same trap that I got caught in.

3536
04:23:36,140 --> 04:23:36,660
Wee.

3537
04:23:37,520 --> 04:23:38,520
Okay, here we go.

3538
04:23:38,700 --> 04:23:40,020
This is what I needed to do.

3539
04:23:41,880 --> 04:23:43,320
Maybe this is where I...

3540
04:23:43,320 --> 04:23:43,440
Oh.

3541
04:23:45,400 --> 04:23:46,320
Dead body?

3542
04:23:49,440 --> 04:23:49,900
Hello?

3543
04:23:50,200 --> 04:23:51,720
Oh, this is a boss fight?

3544
04:23:52,300 --> 04:23:52,680
Question mark?

3545
04:23:57,220 --> 04:23:57,600
Oh.

3546
04:23:57,940 --> 04:23:59,260
This looks ominous.

3547
04:24:00,820 --> 04:24:01,960
This looks scary.

3548
04:24:02,520 --> 04:24:03,980
Chapel of the Beast.

3549
04:24:07,000 --> 04:24:08,620
What is this?

3550
04:24:10,560 --> 04:24:12,560
Okay, there's a shortcut here.

3551
04:24:21,630 --> 04:24:22,230
What?!

3552
04:24:22,230 --> 04:24:23,810
Okay, we gotta farm.

3553
04:24:25,930 --> 04:24:27,370
Okay, we gotta go back.

3554
04:24:27,690 --> 04:24:29,070
I gotta get some thread.

3555
04:24:31,550 --> 04:24:33,850
I used to glide too much, guys.

3556
04:24:35,510 --> 04:24:39,390
I glided too much, and now I don't know how to do anything else.

3557
04:24:41,030 --> 04:24:41,630
Wee!

3558
04:24:51,760 --> 04:24:52,360
Stupid.

3559
04:24:55,920 --> 04:24:56,520
Wee!

3560
04:25:01,990 --> 04:25:02,670

3561
04:25:10,880 --> 04:25:37,040

3562
04:25:38,300 --> 04:25:39,560
Oh, here it is.

3563
04:25:40,920 --> 04:25:41,480
Wait.

3564
04:25:43,120 --> 04:25:44,080
Where is he?

3565
04:25:44,940 --> 04:25:45,880
Oh, here, here.

3566
04:25:46,660 --> 04:25:47,020

3567
04:25:49,080 --> 04:25:49,640
Okay.

3568
04:25:51,440 --> 04:25:53,180
We'll go deep talks and go up.

3569
04:25:53,400 --> 04:25:54,500
I think that's faster.

3570
04:25:56,280 --> 04:25:57,640
I think that's a lot faster.

3571
04:26:03,400 --> 04:26:03,720
Okay.

3572
04:26:07,580 --> 04:26:08,540
Oh shit, okay.

3573
04:26:09,140 --> 04:26:09,580
That's fine.

3574
04:26:09,600 --> 04:26:11,120
Okay, how do I get there faster?

3575
04:26:11,300 --> 04:26:13,280
Okay, we go up top, then right.

3576
04:26:14,320 --> 04:26:15,260
Is that it?

3577
04:26:15,880 --> 04:26:16,160
Yeah.

3578
04:26:22,530 --> 04:26:24,290
It's this way.

3579
04:26:26,530 --> 04:26:26,830
Alright.

3580
04:26:30,670 --> 04:26:31,210
Wee!

3581
04:26:31,850 --> 04:26:32,790
Hot shit!

3582
04:26:35,350 --> 04:26:36,110
Wee!

3583
04:26:36,650 --> 04:26:38,550
I can't help it, guys.

3584
04:26:40,430 --> 04:26:41,190
Okay.

3585
04:26:46,560 --> 04:26:49,000
Alright, yeah, go up here.

3586
04:26:52,740 --> 04:26:53,080
Uh...

3587
04:26:53,420 --> 04:26:55,740
Do you remember how to get there fast?

3588
04:26:57,000 --> 04:26:57,720
This way?

3589
04:27:02,590 --> 04:27:04,010
No, that's the...

3590
04:27:04,010 --> 04:27:04,810
wall dash.

3591
04:27:05,170 --> 04:27:06,750
I do that when I have wall dash.

3592
04:27:08,330 --> 04:27:09,750
Okay, buddy!

3593
04:27:11,470 --> 04:27:12,150
Okay!

3594
04:27:15,970 --> 04:27:17,710

Oh my god.

3599
04:28:30,970 --> 04:28:33,470
Okay, it's harder to do this when...

3600
04:28:33,890 --> 04:28:37,110
Okay, I'll say it's very hard to do the float.

3601
04:28:38,090 --> 04:28:39,730
And this at the same time.

3602
04:28:41,090 --> 04:28:42,190
It's very difficult.

3603
04:28:42,350 --> 04:28:43,330
I forgot to sit in a chair.

3604
04:28:43,710 --> 04:28:44,910
I forgot to sit in a chair.

3605
04:28:45,170 --> 04:28:45,870
Oh my god.

3606
04:28:45,890 --> 04:28:47,210
Okay, we're going to try and get to the chair.

3607
04:28:51,750 --> 04:28:53,470
Okay, let's try to get to the chair.

3608
04:29:01,980 --> 04:29:02,400
Okay.

3609
04:29:02,840 --> 04:29:03,340
Oh my god.

3610
04:29:04,120 --> 04:29:06,260
Imagine if I stepped on that trap again.

3611
04:29:09,640 --> 04:29:11,440
Wait, isn't that chair the trap?

3612
04:29:11,840 --> 04:29:14,120
Oh my god, that's not even a real chair!

3613
04:29:19,940 --> 04:29:21,600
It wasn't even a real...

3614
04:29:21,600 --> 04:29:22,700
Oh my god.

3615
04:29:23,660 --> 04:29:25,120
I just remember.

3616
04:29:25,840 --> 04:29:27,340
That chair wasn't even real.

3617
04:29:27,500 --> 04:29:28,560
That's the worst part.

3618
04:29:32,540 --> 04:29:33,580
Oh my god.

3619
04:29:34,140 --> 04:29:35,360
Please let me...

3620
04:29:35,360 --> 04:29:36,160
I'm your little...

3621
04:29:36,220 --> 04:29:38,100
That's the worst part.

3622
04:29:39,020 --> 04:29:41,880
It wasn't even a real chair.

3623
04:29:44,400 --> 04:29:45,080
Oh!

3624
04:29:45,840 --> 04:29:46,780
Oh, no touch.

3625
04:29:51,500 --> 04:29:52,840
I gotta be so careful.

3626
04:29:55,640 --> 04:29:56,500
It can be.

3627
04:29:56,620 --> 04:29:57,720
No, it can't.

3628
04:29:57,860 --> 04:29:58,740
It's a trap.

3629
04:30:01,320 --> 04:30:02,920
I can disarm it?

3630
04:30:03,040 --> 04:30:03,440
Hell.

3631
04:30:05,540 --> 04:30:06,820
Wait, I can.

3632
04:30:16,520 --> 04:30:18,040
Look, it came back.

3633
04:30:21,900 --> 04:30:22,620
It went...

3634
04:30:22,620 --> 04:30:22,760
Oh!

3635
04:30:24,640 --> 04:30:27,420
Secret E!

3636
04:30:28,240 --> 04:30:29,960
I got to sit in my chair!

3637
04:30:31,200 --> 04:30:31,280
Oh!

3638
04:30:33,620 --> 04:30:34,100
Nice.

3639
04:30:34,500 --> 04:30:35,420
Okay, that's good to know.

3640
04:30:36,620 --> 04:30:36,800
Ow.

3641
04:30:38,160 --> 04:30:39,320
I'm happy now.

3642
04:30:40,100 --> 04:30:40,940
Thank God.

3643
04:30:41,540 --> 04:30:42,780
Ow, it's gonna be so...

3644
04:30:42,780 --> 04:30:44,020
You can actually disarm.

3645
04:30:44,080 --> 04:30:46,040
Okay, we're not gonna fall for this guy again.

3646
04:30:50,060 --> 04:30:50,580
Okay.

3647
04:30:50,640 --> 04:30:52,460
Are you serious?

3648
04:30:53,280 --> 04:30:56,140
Oh my god, you're actually such a nerd.

3649
04:31:00,680 --> 04:31:01,740
That's good to know.

3650
04:31:03,920 --> 04:31:05,520
That's actually good to know.

3651
04:31:07,880 --> 04:31:11,540
Okay, I'm gonna have to figure out how to do this fucking thing properly.

3652
04:31:21,040 --> 04:31:23,520
I don't know why, like sometimes it just...

3653
04:31:37,430 --> 04:31:38,590
There we go.

3654
04:31:47,460 --> 04:31:49,080
Like, this is easy.

3655
04:31:49,360 --> 04:31:50,400
This is easy.

3656
04:31:55,210 --> 04:31:56,190
We float down.

3657
04:31:56,410 --> 04:31:57,450
We float down.

3658
04:31:58,970 --> 04:32:05,900
We float down.

3659
04:32:06,300 --> 04:32:06,940
Yippee.

3660
04:32:07,520 --> 04:32:08,020
Yippee.

3661
04:32:08,340 --> 04:32:08,780
There, see?

3662
04:32:10,300 --> 04:32:11,240
Oh, wait.

3663
04:32:11,400 --> 04:32:12,020
He evil?

3664
04:32:13,220 --> 04:32:14,000
Why evil?

3665
04:32:14,180 --> 04:32:15,160
I flee you.

3666
04:32:17,680 --> 04:32:18,700
There you go.

3667
04:32:21,460 --> 04:32:21,960
I...

3668
04:32:24,160 --> 04:32:26,760
Get fucking Merry Poppins!

3669
04:32:29,600 --> 04:32:31,200
Oh my god.

3670
04:32:31,480 --> 04:32:32,880
Big strong bug.

3671
04:32:35,280 --> 04:32:37,180
That tab done.

3672
04:32:39,800 --> 04:32:40,600
Wee.

3673
04:32:40,780 --> 04:32:41,580
Okay.

3674
04:32:43,060 --> 04:32:43,740
A shortcut.

3675
04:32:45,640 --> 04:32:47,400
Okay, now we...

3676
04:32:47,400 --> 04:32:49,100
Boss, but...

3677
04:32:49,100 --> 04:32:50,780
I don't know if I can first try him.

3678
04:32:51,620 --> 04:32:52,760
If he does...

3679
04:32:52,780 --> 04:32:54,820
Oh, I knew it.

3680
04:32:55,080 --> 04:32:57,960
See, like, they all do two damage now.

3681
04:32:59,760 --> 04:33:00,040
What?

3682
04:33:00,480 --> 04:33:00,860
What?

3683
04:33:02,740 --> 04:33:04,860
They all do plus two.

3684
04:33:05,200 --> 04:33:06,480
It's so annoying.

3685
04:33:12,400 --> 04:33:13,140
Okay.

3686
04:33:14,160 --> 04:33:15,620
Get two plus two.

3687
04:33:16,800 --> 04:33:17,220
Oh, wait.

3688
04:33:17,440 --> 04:33:18,590
I messed up that.

3689
04:33:21,370 --> 04:33:23,480
Didn't get me this time.

3690
04:33:28,300 --> 04:33:28,640
2.

3691
04:33:29,460 --> 04:33:30,600
Stupid plus 2 shit.

3692
04:33:31,660 --> 04:33:34,280
It pisses me ah.

3693
04:33:34,740 --> 04:33:34,980
Ha!

3694
04:33:37,640 --> 04:33:39,520
Is this stronger here?

3695
04:33:39,920 --> 04:33:43,540
But the only thing annoying about that here is that um

3696
04:33:47,070 --> 04:33:47,910
shit.

3697
04:33:50,930 --> 04:33:51,170
Oh.

3698
04:33:53,530 --> 04:33:54,370
Alright.

3699
04:33:56,730 --> 04:33:58,010
Like oh.

3700
04:34:02,680 --> 04:34:03,240
Okay.

3701
04:34:05,820 --> 04:34:07,300
I need to lock in for this.

3702
04:34:07,560 --> 04:34:08,540
This guy is difficult.

3703
04:34:14,410 --> 04:34:14,650
Okay.

3704
04:34:19,580 --> 04:34:19,880
Alright.

3705
04:34:20,260 --> 04:34:20,540
Nice.

3706
04:34:21,740 --> 04:34:22,020
Oh.

3707
04:34:23,460 --> 04:34:24,280
There we go.

3708
04:34:26,380 --> 04:34:27,580
I'm gonna use my needle.

3709
04:34:28,380 --> 04:34:28,700
Whoa!

3710
04:34:29,240 --> 04:34:30,220
Oh, what?

3711
04:34:30,820 --> 04:34:32,100
He has friends!

3712
04:34:33,020 --> 04:34:33,900
How do you have friends?

3713
04:34:35,480 --> 04:34:36,820
Doki got rude.

3714
04:34:39,320 --> 04:34:42,060
You don't deserve no friends.

3715
04:34:48,300 --> 04:34:49,820
Can't believe he has friends.

3716
04:34:54,440 --> 04:34:55,300
Oh my god!

3717
04:34:56,660 --> 04:34:57,420
Crush them!

3718
04:35:01,400 --> 04:35:03,460
This is... this is bullshit.

3719
04:35:05,380 --> 04:35:05,460
Oh!

3720
04:35:10,830 --> 04:35:12,410
And they fly!

3721
04:35:14,570 --> 04:35:16,630
Okay, I was doing really well though.

3722
04:35:16,790 --> 04:35:17,490
I was doing really well.

3723
04:35:17,510 --> 04:35:18,650
I figured out his pattern.

3724
04:35:20,010 --> 04:35:20,530
Oops.

3725
04:35:23,950 --> 04:35:25,210
I need to go back to chair.

3726
04:35:25,930 --> 04:35:28,890
Oh my god, of course this ad fucking blocks me.

3727
04:35:32,170 --> 04:35:35,090
He's not that difficult when you figure out the pattern.

3728
04:35:35,730 --> 04:35:43,210
But it's just, it's when it's not a, it's not a, it just stops becoming a 1v1.

3729
04:35:44,250 --> 04:35:45,070
That's annoying.

3730
04:35:45,290 --> 04:35:46,190
Oh my god.

3731
04:35:46,390 --> 04:35:47,330
I needed that too.

3732
04:35:47,330 --> 04:35:48,490
Okay, I got full souls.

3733
04:35:50,610 --> 04:35:52,050
And then he dropped his friends.

3734
04:35:55,920 --> 04:35:59,340
No, he doesn't deserve nice things to be said about him.

3735
04:36:02,860 --> 04:36:04,040
He's pretty easy.

3736
04:36:04,480 --> 04:36:09,680
It's literally just the fact that he has his friends helping him.

3737
04:36:10,300 --> 04:36:11,240
Which should be illegal.

3738
04:36:11,560 --> 04:36:16,720
If I don't have my fucking friends helping me, he doesn't deserve that friends helping him.

3739
04:36:20,980 --> 04:36:21,480
No.

3740
04:36:21,700 --> 04:36:22,100
Ah!

3741
04:36:23,500 --> 04:36:26,040
Psychic reading the super chat.

3742
04:36:27,380 --> 04:36:32,000
No friends like my solo cute apex, night ring, and marvel rivals cry.

3743
04:36:32,540 --> 04:36:34,940
Psychic, thank you for the super chat.

3744
04:36:37,720 --> 04:36:38,760
That was...

3745
04:36:38,760 --> 04:36:40,100
Are you serious?

3746
04:36:41,260 --> 04:36:41,600
Quinn.

3747
04:36:42,680 --> 04:36:44,080
Oh my god.

3748
04:36:51,210 --> 04:36:53,510
I literally just have to stay on the ground for this.

3749
04:36:55,490 --> 04:36:55,990
There you go.

3750
04:37:03,060 --> 04:37:04,280
Are you serious?

3751
04:37:04,680 --> 04:37:05,040
Holy fuck.

3752
04:37:05,160 --> 04:37:05,340
Okay.

3753
04:37:06,800 --> 04:37:08,080
I messed that up.

3754
04:37:10,040 --> 04:37:11,240
There you go.

3755
04:37:13,700 --> 04:37:14,160
That's fine.

3756
04:37:14,840 --> 04:37:17,020
I got some of my HP back, though.

3757
04:37:22,310 --> 04:37:22,370
Oh.

3758
04:37:24,850 --> 04:37:25,430
Okay.

3759
04:37:26,370 --> 04:37:27,150
Oh, no.

3760
04:37:27,230 --> 04:37:27,890
Not the friends.

3761
04:37:28,890 --> 04:37:29,070
No!

3762
04:37:29,330 --> 04:37:29,590
No!

3763
04:37:32,790 --> 04:37:33,650
His friend!

3764
04:37:38,710 --> 04:37:40,430
My friends blocked me!

3765
04:37:42,190 --> 04:37:45,490
I was about to fly a different way!

3766
04:37:51,420 --> 04:37:52,680
His friends cheated.

3767
04:37:55,960 --> 04:37:56,400
Oh!

3768
04:37:57,340 --> 04:37:59,100
His friends are not strong!

3769
04:37:59,320 --> 04:38:00,840
They just have numbers!

3770
04:38:01,240 --> 04:38:02,700
I need to make sure I don't step on the trap.

3771
04:38:06,800 --> 04:38:07,760
Stupid friend.

3772
04:38:08,340 --> 04:38:09,360
I got friend blocked.

3773
04:38:10,820 --> 04:38:12,280
Goddamn friend blocked.

3774
04:38:12,960 --> 04:38:13,560
Wait a sec.

3775
04:38:13,940 --> 04:38:14,720
Let's realize.

3776
04:38:17,000 --> 04:38:18,020
Alright, there you go.

3777
04:38:19,180 --> 04:38:26,120
Basically, whatever happens is that whenever I mute myself, the GoXLR slider always goes, like, sometimes it'll go down by one.

3778
04:38:26,580 --> 04:38:35,600
So, like, I always have to, like, raise the volume back up every time I mute myself to make sure that it's back at this what it's supposed to be.

3779
04:38:39,120 --> 04:38:43,240
The fight didn't even start yet.

3780
04:38:47,920 --> 04:38:50,080
That should have been illegal.

3781
04:38:57,100 --> 04:38:58,460
There we go.

3782
04:39:04,680 --> 04:39:04,980
Alright.

3783
04:39:06,240 --> 04:39:08,620
I need to make sure I don't fucking...

3784
04:39:09,140 --> 04:39:10,520
I don't jump too much.

3785
04:39:14,040 --> 04:39:15,080
There we go.

3786
04:39:17,560 --> 04:39:18,360
Okay.

3787
04:39:22,560 --> 04:39:23,820
Oh my god, friend time.

3788
04:39:25,500 --> 04:39:27,060
You stupid friend.

3789
04:39:39,080 --> 04:39:39,840
Mad.

3790
04:39:42,780 --> 04:39:45,340
He's not even that hard.

3791
04:39:45,880 --> 04:39:48,580
It's literally the plus two and friend.

3792
04:39:51,700 --> 04:39:55,840
The plus two and the friend buff is what's fucking me right now.

3793
04:39:57,860 --> 04:40:18,580
i swear to god he's i like i know his patterns it's literally plus two plus two stupid friends why does he have so many i'm gonna kill all his friends and i hope he dies alone

3794
04:40:21,680 --> 04:40:32,180
i hate it i hate multiple enemies rng i hate it so much It's literally one of my biggest pet peeves.

3795
04:40:41,400 --> 04:40:44,800
It's one of my biggest pet peeves in terms of hero design.

3796
04:40:45,400 --> 04:40:47,500
Or like boss fight designs.

3797
04:40:51,880 --> 04:40:52,840
Oh my god.

3798
04:40:52,940 --> 04:40:54,320
Okay, that was foolish.

3799
04:40:55,040 --> 04:40:56,440
I was impatient there.

3800
04:40:58,040 --> 04:41:00,500
He's successfully rage-aiding me.

3801
04:41:05,700 --> 04:41:07,780
He's rage baiting me so well.

3802
04:41:09,400 --> 04:41:10,940
I hate it

3803
04:41:18,680 --> 04:41:34,960
Alright Yeah Maybe He gets this friend now Thank god thank god thank god he killed his own friend

3804
04:41:44,680 --> 04:41:47,940
That's actually so fucked

3805
04:41:53,430 --> 04:41:56,830
Okay I have to be so careful

3806
04:42:00,980 --> 04:42:02,000
Oh my god.

3807
04:42:04,240 --> 04:42:06,020
Oh, that's not fair.

3808
04:42:10,020 --> 04:42:10,560
Oh, thank god.

3809
04:42:11,640 --> 04:42:12,560
Oh, thank god.

3810
04:42:21,850 --> 04:42:22,890
It's caught up, boss.

3811
04:42:23,150 --> 04:42:23,610
Exactly!

3812
04:42:25,370 --> 04:42:27,770
I did not bring your own friend party!

3813
04:42:30,350 --> 04:42:30,950
Oh!

3814
04:42:32,170 --> 04:42:33,990
Oh, my god.

3815
04:42:35,770 --> 04:42:37,270
Oh, my god!

3816
04:42:41,960 --> 04:42:45,560
He takes up half the fucking screen.

3817
04:42:45,560 --> 04:42:49,160
He took up so many parts of the screen.

3818
04:42:55,270 --> 04:42:56,350
Oh my god.

3819
04:42:56,510 --> 04:42:59,150
I feel like I'm in fight club right now.

3820
04:43:01,470 --> 04:43:04,330
This feels like fight club.

3821
04:43:12,860 --> 04:43:14,880
He's literally putting me in fight club.

3822
04:43:17,040 --> 04:43:17,460
Oh.

3823
04:43:18,980 --> 04:43:44,860
difficult i know i keep saying but it's literally not difficult it's just it's just the randomness the rng like him himself it's not as like hard to figure out it's just the random elements oops okay i look how i set that and then i said okay okay you know i deserve that

3824
04:43:50,840 --> 04:44:25,580
I rushed it There I rushed it Oh my god I threw off my groove Lost kin Yeah it feels like Lost kin But like Lost kin is Not as frustrating Only because I'm playing with anger now I'm not playing with I'm playing with anger I'm not thinking things through Because I'm so angry At least like Lost kin These guys are like tiny and they're one shot his friends are so tanky too

3826
04:44:49,920 --> 04:44:56,440

3827
04:44:56,540 --> 04:44:59,100
I wonder if that, like, gives me...

3828
04:44:59,100 --> 04:45:00,300
I wonder.

3829
04:45:01,860 --> 04:45:02,420
I'm curious.

3830
04:45:03,660 --> 04:45:06,160
Why is he, like, up in the air?

3831
04:45:09,850 --> 04:45:11,150
What the fuck?

3832
04:45:11,910 --> 04:45:13,910
He's, like, more in the air now.

3833
04:45:14,030 --> 04:45:14,770
It's so weird.

3834
04:45:20,700 --> 04:45:22,460
He's supposed to be more on the ground.

3835
04:45:24,980 --> 04:45:25,320
Okay.

3836
04:45:30,110 --> 04:45:30,630
Alright.

3837
04:45:31,610 --> 04:45:32,330
There we go.

3838
04:45:32,710 --> 04:45:33,210
Gwen.

3839
04:45:36,570 --> 04:45:40,230
He's like, well, you keep calling friends, so I assume like...

3840
04:45:40,230 --> 04:45:44,630
I thought you wanted to bring my friends along, too.

3841
04:45:45,110 --> 04:45:46,610
I'm like, that's not what I mean.

3842
04:45:48,690 --> 04:45:49,810
And you know it.

3843
04:45:57,070 --> 04:45:59,010
I just have to get rid of...

3844
04:46:02,030 --> 04:46:03,710
I have to get rid of him.

3845
04:46:11,590 --> 04:46:12,530
Oh, my God.

3846
04:46:13,950 --> 04:46:14,370
Okay.

3847
04:46:17,500 --> 04:46:21,400

thank god

3850
04:46:42,850 --> 04:46:48,830
friend that's fine no no

3851
04:47:02,800 --> 04:47:09,380
god if he did one damage if he did one damage This shit would be even easier.

3852
04:47:10,180 --> 04:47:11,920
But he doesn't do one damage.

3853
04:47:15,380 --> 04:47:17,100
It was such bad timing.

3854
04:47:17,540 --> 04:47:20,120
The fact that two of them spawned in.

3855
04:47:25,880 --> 04:47:26,400
You know what?

3856
04:47:26,420 --> 04:47:27,520
I know what I need.

3857
04:47:28,200 --> 04:47:28,960
It's time.

3858
04:47:30,780 --> 04:47:32,780
For him to have a bad time.

3859
04:47:44,860 --> 04:47:47,520
All right, here we go.

3860
04:47:47,840 --> 04:47:49,920
It's on silk song time.

3861
04:47:53,000 --> 04:47:53,180
Okay.

3862
04:47:55,740 --> 04:47:56,420
Ah, shit.

3863
04:47:57,760 --> 04:47:59,340
I already messed it up.

3864
04:48:00,480 --> 04:48:01,260
Are you sure?

3865
04:48:05,940 --> 04:48:10,100
I didn't even figure out when is the right time to use this.

3866
04:48:13,280 --> 04:48:14,080
Oh, what?

3867
04:48:15,380 --> 04:48:16,240
Okay, I always...

3868
04:48:17,040 --> 04:48:17,520
Alright.

3869
04:48:21,480 --> 04:48:21,780
Okay.

3870
04:48:26,370 --> 04:48:27,690
Oh, thank god, okay.

3871
04:48:32,410 --> 04:48:34,370
Oh, I'm locking in.

3872
04:48:34,450 --> 04:48:35,230
I'm actually locking in.

3873
04:48:35,270 --> 04:48:36,950
This guy has been tilting me.

3874
04:48:39,650 --> 04:48:40,190
No.

3875
04:48:41,070 --> 04:48:41,110
No.

3876
04:48:42,630 --> 04:48:44,170
Oh my god, I hate this guy.

3877
04:48:44,990 --> 04:48:46,130
Thank god, okay.

3878
04:48:48,190 --> 04:48:49,450
Thank god he killed his friend.

3879
04:48:51,030 --> 04:48:54,630
Because I think this one is the worst one to get RNG-wise.

3880
04:48:59,940 --> 04:49:03,520
And then he gives it to me again!

3881
04:49:18,380 --> 04:49:19,340
At RNG!

3882
04:49:22,120 --> 04:49:24,820
He's so hard to kill, like, the big guy.

3883
04:49:25,000 --> 04:49:26,160
He's so tanky.

3884
04:49:26,180 --> 04:49:50,580
he too he's so fucking tanky so like he's so tanky the rng like i need the little guy all right that's a run killer i feel like if you're speed running this like you gotta hope it's the little guys because the big one seemed like a run killer the

3885
04:49:54,730 --> 04:50:28,450
thing is i it's hard to let me have him try and take him out myself like have him the big guy because he could I have such limited space I have such limited space in general for it I wonder if that like counts as damage I don't know me doing that needle thing counts as like damage in general oh shit that was an accident That's good,

3886
04:50:28,530 --> 04:50:29,090
I have.

3887
04:50:34,980 --> 04:50:35,100
Okay.

3888
04:50:40,100 --> 04:50:40,600
Alright.

3889
04:50:41,900 --> 04:50:43,800
Alright, friend coming down.

3890
04:50:45,480 --> 04:50:46,640
Friend coming down.

3891
04:50:50,500 --> 04:50:52,040
Oh my god, that was a...

3892
04:50:52,040 --> 04:50:53,160
Oh my god!

3893
04:50:54,880 --> 04:50:57,280
He ricocheted me and threw me...

3894
04:50:58,040 --> 04:50:59,800
This is my ceiling.

3895
04:51:00,040 --> 04:51:01,060
This is the filter.

3896
04:51:01,620 --> 04:51:02,700
This is the filter.

3897
04:51:03,200 --> 04:51:03,860
Okay.

3898
04:51:07,560 --> 04:51:09,000
Oh my god.

3899
04:51:09,820 --> 04:51:09,820
Stupid.

3900
04:51:10,000 --> 04:51:12,120
I'm fucking- I'm farming you for thread.

3901
04:51:12,460 --> 04:51:13,380
And I'm going back.

3902
04:51:17,010 --> 04:51:18,210
Angry jumps.

3903
04:51:19,050 --> 04:51:19,770
I'm angry!

3904
04:51:23,170 --> 04:51:25,230
I need to focus up.

3905
04:51:27,650 --> 04:51:29,470
I know I keep saying I need to focus up.

3906
04:51:31,730 --> 04:51:31,910
Eh.

3907
04:51:32,330 --> 04:51:32,910
Fuck it.

3908
04:51:32,990 --> 04:51:34,410
I don't really need to charge it up.

3909
04:51:36,030 --> 04:51:36,450
Oh!

3910
04:51:40,150 --> 04:51:49,190
I would say if you can beat I will say if you beat this guy like pretty fast you get good you get good RNG plus like you're pretty good

3911
04:51:52,970 --> 04:52:14,210
I think this is the filter boss for the new players only because like there's too so much RNG if you get really good RNG with like with like um like his the spawners I think like It's doable But I'm not

3912
04:52:19,560 --> 04:52:27,760
They're locking I might not talk as much right now because this guy makes me so fucking angry Yeah

3913
04:52:30,950 --> 04:52:38,350
Okay, let's hope that does a lot of damage because I don't know Thank God

3914
04:52:44,100 --> 04:52:57,140
Yeah Okay, friend time.

3915
04:53:03,650 --> 04:53:04,730
Nice.

3916
04:53:08,380 --> 04:53:09,340
Fucking course.

3917
04:53:12,780 --> 04:53:13,100
Okay.

3918
04:53:16,820 --> 04:53:17,700
Okay.

3919
04:53:26,360 --> 04:53:27,740
Oh, no, not another one.

3920
04:53:29,540 --> 04:53:30,080
No!

3921
04:53:31,940 --> 04:53:33,020
No!

3922
04:53:38,960 --> 04:53:39,420
No!

3923
04:53:39,420 --> 04:53:41,080
Blocked so much!

3924
04:53:42,240 --> 04:53:44,340
They blocked the...

3925
04:53:44,340 --> 04:53:44,720
Oh.

3926
04:53:44,740 --> 04:53:47,180
arena so much.

3927
04:53:50,780 --> 04:53:53,160
A stupid arena block.

3928
04:53:56,370 --> 04:53:57,670
I hate him.

3929
04:53:58,390 --> 04:53:59,570
He doesn't deserve friends.

3930
04:53:59,750 --> 04:54:01,310
I will kill all his friends.

3931
04:54:01,930 --> 04:54:03,150
And so he'll die alone.

3932
04:54:03,330 --> 04:54:07,350
Everyone he's ever encountered or met will be gone from this living earth.

3933
04:54:11,770 --> 04:54:15,190
I will make sure he dies alone.

3934
04:54:16,210 --> 04:54:20,890
Because anyone he's ever met is the reason for their deaths.

3935
04:54:21,530 --> 04:54:23,570
He is the reason why they're all dead.

3936
04:54:24,770 --> 04:54:26,090
Said calmly.

3937
04:54:26,610 --> 04:54:26,930
Everyone.

3938
04:54:27,290 --> 04:54:28,550
Not even just his friends.

3939
04:54:28,970 --> 04:54:34,130
Everyone he's ever met, interacted, or like had a presence in their minds.

3940
04:54:39,410 --> 04:54:42,590
Where I'm Tokyo's best Tokyo.

3941
04:54:43,030 --> 04:54:44,910
Thank you for the super chat.

3942
04:54:45,050 --> 04:54:45,490
Thank you.

3943
04:54:57,660 --> 04:54:58,420
Okay.

3944
04:55:02,950 --> 04:55:06,890
There has to be an easier way to deal with, like, the...

3945
04:55:14,470 --> 04:55:15,230
Okay.

3946
04:55:21,260 --> 04:55:21,960
Friend time?

3947
04:55:23,900 --> 04:55:24,680
Oh, my god.

3948
04:55:25,400 --> 04:55:25,820
Holy shit.

3949
04:55:26,200 --> 04:55:27,620
Another one!

3950
04:55:33,020 --> 04:55:34,240
It's so bullshit!

3951
04:55:37,740 --> 04:55:38,500
Okay.

3952
04:55:39,540 --> 04:55:40,520
He caught...

3953
04:55:40,540 --> 04:55:50,700
okay that's just I'm sorry I'm just playing with anger now like that was so bullshit oh my god

3954
04:55:57,350 --> 04:56:03,850
okay just my friend charge up didn't work I'm

3955
04:56:09,730 --> 04:56:11,190
crashing up

3956
04:56:15,900 --> 04:57:00,790
all right and then yeah I got rage baited I'm getting rage baited so hard he's like those I swear he's like Lex Luther and his fucking rage baiting monkeys that's him that's him and his friends no I don't need a jump but I thought where when I was just trying to position myself in a good area that's him he's like the rage bait baiting monkeys with Lex Luther he's Lex Luther and those his friends are all the monkeys and they're all typing like fuck you You suck!

3957
04:57:02,430 --> 04:57:04,110
I can't believe that's a real movie scene.

3958
04:57:04,770 --> 04:57:06,530
I didn't watch it, but I saw the clips.

3959
04:57:06,750 --> 04:57:11,490
And then it's literally just like a bunch of monkeys like trolling Superman.

3960
04:57:12,550 --> 04:57:13,690
The damn Luther monkeys.

3961
04:57:13,970 --> 04:57:14,790
It's so silly.

3962
04:57:15,330 --> 04:57:16,830
It's actually so silly.

3963
04:57:17,170 --> 04:57:18,350
It's one of my... It's my...

3964
04:57:18,350 --> 04:57:20,830
I never watched the movie yet.

3965
04:57:21,290 --> 04:57:23,530
But it's honestly one of my favorite scenes.

3966
04:57:27,960 --> 04:57:30,300
It's such a fucking goofy scene.

3967
04:57:31,940 --> 04:57:36,080
The amount of hate he has for him is so justified.

3968
04:57:41,740 --> 04:57:46,520
Oh my god, it's the first one, too.

3969
04:57:47,240 --> 04:57:50,120
The fact

3970
04:57:59,260 --> 04:58:01,180
that he goes all the way,

3971
04:58:16,250 --> 04:58:18,470
I wish it was just the ground one.

3972
04:58:38,230 --> 04:58:39,710
Oh, ding guy.

3973
04:58:45,750 --> 04:58:47,030
Oh my god, no!

3974
04:58:48,490 --> 04:58:50,430
I should have just got hit by the small one.

3975
04:59:05,220 --> 04:59:05,740
Ren.

3976
04:59:12,690 --> 04:59:13,750
Oh my god!

3977
04:59:14,670 --> 04:59:16,150
I need to just be hit by...

3978
04:59:16,150 --> 04:59:16,590
Ah!

3979
04:59:18,590 --> 04:59:19,630
It's him!

3980
04:59:20,110 --> 04:59:22,850
The big ones throw me off so much!

3981
04:59:24,890 --> 04:59:28,210
Yeah, I need to be hit by the small one, not by the big one.

3982
04:59:28,490 --> 04:59:30,570
Because at least the small one is 1 HP.

3983
04:59:32,590 --> 04:59:35,230
Actually, I don't know if the other guy is also...

3984
04:59:40,190 --> 04:59:40,590
Oh...

3985
04:59:41,210 --> 04:59:42,050
No, it does.

3986
04:59:42,310 --> 04:59:47,110
The ram lets you take out his minions, but it's so hard to time it correctly.

3987
04:59:48,490 --> 04:59:51,010
I know that you're like, why are you gonna hit by the little guys?

3988
04:59:51,130 --> 04:59:51,750
I don't care.

3989
04:59:52,050 --> 04:59:53,670
Like, I have a bench next to me.

3990
04:59:53,790 --> 04:59:55,190
I just need a farm thread.

3991
05:00:00,780 --> 05:00:03,260
Yeah, maybe I'll... Yeah, I'm gonna try and use my needles more.

3992
05:00:08,860 --> 05:00:09,600
You're right.

3993
05:00:10,060 --> 05:00:11,660
I'm going to be more aggressive with my needle.

3994
05:00:13,760 --> 05:00:14,580
I think that's the strat.

3995
05:00:15,240 --> 05:00:21,840
I'm just worried because he does so much damage that I just want to heal.

3996
05:00:22,880 --> 05:00:24,400
I'm trying to save it for heal.

3997
05:00:30,520 --> 05:00:32,600
Oh, does the cocoon give me a throw no matter what?

3998
05:00:33,140 --> 05:00:33,640
I don't know.

3999
05:00:36,400 --> 05:00:37,840
The first phase is easy.

4000
05:00:38,940 --> 05:00:40,160
was just a 1v1.

4001
05:00:40,760 --> 05:00:41,740
He's fucking done.

4002
05:00:42,040 --> 05:00:42,580
He knows.

4003
05:00:44,600 --> 05:00:45,780
He fucking knows.

4004
05:00:55,450 --> 05:00:59,250
He knows if it's just a 1v1 it's over for him.

4005
05:01:01,030 --> 05:01:02,030
I missed.

4006
05:01:03,590 --> 05:01:04,590
There we go.

4007
05:01:14,320 --> 05:01:14,880
Ah!

4008
05:01:16,240 --> 05:01:16,780
Yeah!

4009
05:01:17,360 --> 05:01:21,300
He knows he... No, the big guys isn't... I don't know if the big guys are one shot.

4010
05:01:21,360 --> 05:01:22,940
Okay, that third gives me full...

4011
05:01:26,540 --> 05:01:27,500
He knows.

4012
05:01:30,240 --> 05:01:33,460
He knows that I win in a 1v1 no matter what.

4013
05:01:34,020 --> 05:01:35,020
Are you serious?

4014
05:01:35,180 --> 05:01:35,900
Okay, fuck it.

4015
05:01:36,680 --> 05:01:38,180
He actually backed up.

4016
05:01:38,300 --> 05:01:39,680
He's never backed up before.

4017
05:01:44,680 --> 05:01:45,920
Yeah, I got comboed.

4018
05:01:46,600 --> 05:01:47,160
That's fine.

4019
05:01:47,960 --> 05:01:48,560
That's fine.

4020
05:01:48,720 --> 05:01:50,220
I am 2 HP instead of 3.

4021
05:01:50,400 --> 05:01:52,720
But his first attack is so...

4022
05:01:52,720 --> 05:01:55,360
His first phase is, like, not that difficult.

4023
05:01:55,700 --> 05:01:56,640
Okay, so I don't have to farm.

4024
05:01:56,720 --> 05:01:57,080
That's good.

4025
05:01:58,320 --> 05:01:59,500
That's good to know.

4026
05:02:03,200 --> 05:02:04,400
That is a weird hit.

4027
05:02:05,000 --> 05:02:06,840
I thought, like...

4028
05:02:06,840 --> 05:02:09,360
Okay, the hitbox is not...

4029
05:02:09,360 --> 05:02:10,980
I don't know the hitbox.

4030
05:02:13,400 --> 05:02:13,740
Alright.

4031
05:02:20,230 --> 05:02:21,190
I get, like, I...

4032
05:02:21,190 --> 05:02:21,970
Do you guys see that?

4033
05:02:22,030 --> 05:02:24,130
I get iframes if I hit him.

4034
05:02:24,670 --> 05:02:25,890
Which I've noticed.

4035
05:02:31,580 --> 05:02:32,120
There you go.

4036
05:02:34,060 --> 05:02:34,560
No, no, no!

4037
05:02:34,760 --> 05:02:35,020
I...

4038
05:02:35,020 --> 05:02:35,300
Oh!

4039
05:02:35,380 --> 05:02:35,880
Fuck!

4040
05:02:36,120 --> 05:02:36,700
Okay, that's fine.

4041
05:02:38,320 --> 05:02:39,540
I did not mean to heal.

4042
05:02:40,360 --> 05:02:42,120
I was trying to use the threat attack.

4043
05:02:46,740 --> 05:02:47,560
That's fine.

4044
05:02:51,940 --> 05:02:52,880
Ah, fuck.

4045
05:02:53,940 --> 05:02:54,880
I should have healed that.

4046
05:02:59,360 --> 05:03:00,460
I can't even heal.

4047
05:03:01,840 --> 05:03:02,340
Oh!

4048
05:03:02,600 --> 05:03:03,180
That's good.

4049
05:03:06,730 --> 05:03:07,470
That's fine.

4050
05:03:09,650 --> 05:03:10,630
That's not fine.

4051
05:03:10,950 --> 05:03:11,650
I want HP now.

4052
05:03:17,980 --> 05:03:19,020
Nice.

4053
05:03:22,920 --> 05:03:23,640
Not okay.

4054
05:03:34,790 --> 05:03:35,150
Okay.

4055
05:03:37,390 --> 05:03:37,890
Full HP.

4056
05:03:39,050 --> 05:03:39,810
But I...

4057
05:03:39,810 --> 05:03:40,570
Oh, no.

4058
05:03:42,890 --> 05:03:44,470
Oh, thank God.

4059
05:03:53,510 --> 05:03:54,750
No!

4060
05:04:01,010 --> 05:04:03,830
Oh, I got locked in.

4061
05:04:05,610 --> 05:04:08,050
Okay, now that I know what Grant's flow is through it, the sandwich.

4062
05:04:08,270 --> 05:04:09,430
Yeah, he sandwiched me.

4063
05:04:16,610 --> 05:04:18,030
He sandwiched me hard.

4064
05:04:20,490 --> 05:04:21,490
I looked at chat.

4065
05:04:21,970 --> 05:04:24,110
I didn't realize my ladder was off.

4066
05:04:24,990 --> 05:04:26,070
I was looking at chat.

4067
05:04:33,450 --> 05:04:34,730
Chapel of the Beast.

4068
05:04:36,870 --> 05:04:44,090
Someone said, like, I remember people were like, oh, Mantis is the hard is a hard filter like the first filter matches was not as hard as this

4069
05:04:47,870 --> 05:04:53,530
like oh shit whoops i need to focus i'm not focusing what

4070
05:04:57,450 --> 05:05:08,710
what why did i what what happened it like pushed i like pushed me up i don't know what happened

4071
05:05:13,830 --> 05:05:14,770
Oh, fuck.

4072
05:05:15,090 --> 05:05:15,590
I looked at chat.

4073
05:05:16,230 --> 05:05:17,690
I looked at chat.

4074
05:05:19,290 --> 05:05:20,570
Let's go back to the bench.

4075
05:05:20,710 --> 05:05:21,210
We reset.

4076
05:05:22,730 --> 05:05:23,590
Hee-hee.

4077
05:05:25,850 --> 05:05:27,250
Oh, was it a dash attack?

4078
05:05:27,410 --> 05:05:28,290
I didn't even realize.

4079
05:05:28,790 --> 05:05:29,290
Oopsie.

4080
05:05:37,010 --> 05:05:38,770
I shouldn't look at chat when I have to parkour.

4081
05:05:41,830 --> 05:05:43,150
It's my weakness.

4082
05:05:44,450 --> 05:05:46,250
Yes, I'm still at this part.

4083
05:05:46,790 --> 05:05:50,390
I envy all the streamers that passed this part really, really fast.

4084
05:05:53,270 --> 05:05:54,690
I envy them.

4085
05:05:55,530 --> 05:05:56,250
I hit...

4086
05:05:56,950 --> 05:06:04,370
I think I'm getting hit by, like, the worst RNG possible, too.

4087
05:06:10,500 --> 05:06:11,660
Are you serious?

4088
05:06:12,400 --> 05:06:13,160
When...

4089
05:06:19,910 --> 05:06:24,850
I think everybody can catch up to me now because of this area.

4090
05:06:33,710 --> 05:06:34,470
Oh.

4091
05:06:34,970 --> 05:06:35,690
Oh.

4092
05:06:40,920 --> 05:06:41,980
Okay, nice

4093
05:06:46,440 --> 05:06:48,920
Oh, oh my god

4094
05:06:53,560 --> 05:06:55,360
Nice, okay

4095
05:07:00,280 --> 05:07:03,080
Again, oh my god, he missed

4096
05:07:07,060 --> 05:07:14,340
He actually missed it Okay, there you go

4097
05:07:24,200 --> 05:07:28,430
I can't kill him Wait, what?

4098
05:07:29,770 --> 05:07:37,800
was that guy bugged out wait his helmet bugged out

4099
05:07:42,440 --> 05:07:44,480
yeah that

4100
05:07:49,210 --> 05:08:12,670
one was invincible he gave him an invincibility glitch what more does he need they all kind of bugged what yeah i was thinking like what more do you need have everything you need to fucking kill me.

4101
05:08:13,430 --> 05:08:15,270
You really need more.

4102
05:08:17,390 --> 05:08:18,010
Oh shit.

4103
05:08:18,570 --> 05:08:19,190
Oh shit.

4104
05:08:19,330 --> 05:08:20,150
Okay, I'm raging.

4105
05:08:20,450 --> 05:08:21,050
I'm raging.

4106
05:08:21,870 --> 05:08:22,910
Motherfucker fucking cheated.

4107
05:08:23,050 --> 05:08:24,270
He had plot armor.

4108
05:08:25,110 --> 05:08:27,210
He actually had plot armor.

4109
05:08:40,230 --> 05:08:42,590
At least I'm really good at this parkour now.

4110
05:08:43,770 --> 05:08:46,190
In this specific spot.

4111
05:08:49,710 --> 05:09:10,950
Oh my god I swear Please make this be part of the story Please Oh I have a feeling this is an This is an optional boss I have a feeling I'm just doing an optional boss right now I think that's the worst part I feel like this is an optional boss I Shoot

4112
05:09:20,060 --> 05:09:21,600
Don't tell her.

4113
05:09:25,520 --> 05:09:27,580
Oh, that makes it worse.

4114
05:09:35,380 --> 05:09:36,180
There we go.

4115
05:09:38,880 --> 05:09:39,840
We don't know.

4116
05:09:42,420 --> 05:09:43,100
I...

4117
05:09:44,940 --> 05:09:45,620
Okay.

4118
05:09:46,380 --> 05:09:48,000
I can't do anything about it.

4119
05:09:48,040 --> 05:09:51,100
I don't even know how many staggers do...

4120
05:09:54,380 --> 05:09:56,100
What do you mean?

4121
05:09:56,680 --> 05:09:57,480
Oh, my...

4122
05:10:01,140 --> 05:10:01,820
Okay.

4123
05:10:02,940 --> 05:10:03,760
Oh my god.

4124
05:10:04,260 --> 05:10:05,580
I couldn't kill him in time.

4125
05:10:23,260 --> 05:10:24,080
I know.

4126
05:10:24,420 --> 05:10:27,660
I have a feeling this is an optional boss.

4127
05:10:28,140 --> 05:10:35,780
The more I fight him, the more I fight him and seeing the difficulty spike, I'm so sad.

4128
05:10:37,220 --> 05:10:37,880
I'm going in.

4129
05:10:38,080 --> 05:10:39,000
I'm still going in.

4130
05:10:39,940 --> 05:10:44,320
The more I fight him compared to the other boss.

4131
05:10:45,160 --> 05:10:48,720
There's no way there's no way you're not optional.

4132
05:10:49,160 --> 05:10:51,440
He's no longer optional in my book.

4133
05:10:51,740 --> 05:10:54,380
I have to kill him I don't care.

4134
05:10:54,720 --> 05:10:57,220
I don't care if everybody now is now ahead of me.

4135
05:10:57,820 --> 05:10:58,580
I don't care.

4136
05:10:58,820 --> 05:11:00,400
I have to kill him

4137
05:11:07,680 --> 05:11:08,280
What?

4138
05:11:09,640 --> 05:11:12,180
Oh, I don't know the hitbox.

4139
05:11:12,880 --> 05:11:18,900
I thought I I thought I thought, bro, okay, sometimes her helmet isn't the exact hitbox.

4140
05:11:20,500 --> 05:11:25,840
So I thought, uh, I thought I was, like, about, like, I was, like, under it.

4141
05:11:26,000 --> 05:11:27,120
Oh, wait, what am I missing?

4142
05:11:32,870 --> 05:11:33,810
I'm stubborn.

4143
05:11:34,070 --> 05:11:34,530
I don't care.

4144
05:11:34,690 --> 05:11:35,090
I'm stubborn.

4145
05:11:36,010 --> 05:11:37,410
I will kill him.

4146
05:11:39,390 --> 05:11:40,850
It's personal now.

4147
05:11:41,670 --> 05:11:43,810
Maybe I need to upgrade it now for it.

4148
05:11:49,560 --> 05:11:50,080
Okay.

4149
05:11:51,980 --> 05:13:24,310
tilted no 100% don't worry I am indeed tilted no I am 100% like I'm dying to stupid shit like that when I shouldn't be when what what it made me dash to the left instead of the right it doesn't even tell me where to upgrade my nail this is worse than lost kin i would say i would say lost kin is harder than it's easier than this uh because you can't control the rng of what bugs he spawns if he spawns all the ground ones then it's good if he spawns a giant fucking tanky uh invincible spiky lords guys that also fly then it's bad that take up like one fourth of the screen oh my god sorry I'm like when I'm ranting I lose focus okay okay I need to focus up there you go I'm focusing up for real all right there's friend number one there's

4150
05:13:30,570 --> 05:13:31,550
friend number two

4151
05:13:35,160 --> 05:13:37,920
Oh my god, there's friend number three!

4152
05:13:47,290 --> 05:13:52,590
Because also, whenever he spawns his friends, it's also RNG.

4153
05:13:53,310 --> 05:13:55,850
Because sometimes he doesn't spawn anything!

4154
05:14:01,630 --> 05:14:04,870
It was over when Big One appeared.

4155
05:14:05,770 --> 05:14:06,070
No.

4156
05:14:06,650 --> 05:14:08,870
If I quit now, they win.

4157
05:14:11,290 --> 05:14:12,970
They win!

4158
05:14:27,810 --> 05:14:28,010
Okay.

4159
05:14:30,050 --> 05:14:31,410
Just need to get into a good rhythm.

4160
05:14:33,010 --> 05:14:33,710
There we go.

4161
05:14:44,490 --> 05:14:45,010
Okay.

4162
05:14:47,430 --> 05:14:48,270
Fucking course.

4163
05:14:52,970 --> 05:14:54,350
Oh my god.

4164
05:14:55,670 --> 05:14:56,130
Nice.

4165
05:14:59,780 --> 05:15:00,500
Okay.

4166
05:15:12,250 --> 05:15:13,090
Oh.

4167
05:15:20,510 --> 05:15:21,950
Oh my god.

4168
05:15:23,950 --> 05:15:24,820
Okay, that's fine.

4169
05:15:43,000 --> 05:15:43,860
Okay.

4170
05:15:45,580 --> 05:15:47,780
How many face does he have?

4171
05:15:54,100 --> 05:15:54,560
Oh my god.

4172
05:15:58,890 --> 05:15:59,970
I swear to God.

4173
05:16:20,900 --> 05:16:21,280
Yes!

4174
05:16:22,140 --> 05:16:23,000
Yes!

4175
05:16:32,040 --> 05:16:33,000
That's right.

4176
05:16:33,120 --> 05:16:34,200
That's why you don't need friends.

4177
05:16:34,460 --> 05:16:36,380
I didn't need friends and I killed you.

4178
05:16:36,500 --> 05:16:40,260
This will be time.

4179
05:16:44,300 --> 05:16:46,580
Oh my god.

4180
05:16:50,600 --> 05:16:52,640
I'm so happy.

4181
05:16:55,000 --> 05:16:57,240
I'm so happy.

4182
05:17:00,840 --> 05:17:08,240
tier foes was that buying to enter a wild fury and steal life from prey

4183
05:17:11,810 --> 05:17:14,630

05:17:18,760 --> 05:17:32,720

4185
05:17:33,240 --> 05:17:34,040
And it was not...

4186
05:17:34,040 --> 05:17:34,560
Wait, what?

4187
05:17:34,940 --> 05:17:36,120
Wait, it changed.

4188
05:17:37,740 --> 05:17:38,040
Wait.

4189
05:17:41,160 --> 05:17:42,340
The area changed.

4190
05:17:42,980 --> 05:17:43,780
Didn't notice that.

4191
05:17:47,400 --> 05:17:47,780
Wait.

4192
05:17:49,540 --> 05:17:50,520
Oh, shit.

4193
05:17:50,800 --> 05:17:51,140
What?

4194
05:17:55,760 --> 05:17:57,460
What did I do?

4195
05:18:00,900 --> 05:18:01,580
Cyber...

4196
05:18:01,900 --> 05:18:03,780
Dragoon, thank you for the Akasupa.

4197
05:18:04,100 --> 05:18:05,220
Thank you, thank you.

4198
05:18:05,300 --> 05:18:06,900
Here's your victory bonus.

4199
05:18:07,600 --> 05:18:08,440
Doki Knight.

4200
05:18:08,960 --> 05:18:09,980
I did it.

4201
05:18:10,740 --> 05:18:13,940
Also, that was definitely optional.

4202
05:18:15,060 --> 05:18:17,140
That was fucking optional.

4203
05:18:25,420 --> 05:18:28,200
It was optional.

4204
05:18:38,600 --> 05:18:43,380
Oh my god, where do I go?

4205
05:18:47,200 --> 05:18:49,460
I'm so sad.

4206
05:18:50,400 --> 05:18:53,380
I can't believe that was option.

4207
05:18:58,840 --> 05:19:02,260
Okay, we go back to Firefields.

4208
05:19:02,340 --> 05:19:04,060
There is an area I've yet to go.

4209
05:19:04,820 --> 05:19:05,240
Yeah.

4210
05:19:05,880 --> 05:19:06,920
I can't believe it.

4211
05:19:07,160 --> 05:19:08,520
Everyone's ahead of me now.

4212
05:19:09,440 --> 05:19:18,050
Everyone is like 20 chapters away.

4213
05:19:19,010 --> 05:19:19,870
Wait, where's my...

4214
05:19:19,870 --> 05:19:20,130
Oh.

4215
05:19:22,030 --> 05:19:24,010
But do they have the beast crest?

4216
05:19:24,150 --> 05:19:24,490
True.

4217
05:19:24,970 --> 05:19:25,390
True.

4218
05:19:30,190 --> 05:19:31,550
Where is...

4219
05:19:31,550 --> 05:19:32,090
What?

4220
05:19:37,280 --> 05:19:40,380
I have no compass with the beast crest.

4221
05:19:40,380 --> 05:19:41,900
What's the point?

4222
05:19:42,660 --> 05:19:42,940
What?

4223
05:19:51,520 --> 05:19:52,120
What's the point?

4224
05:19:52,760 --> 05:19:56,600
I don't...

4225
05:19:56,600 --> 05:20:00,820
If I don't have those, I can't even get...

4226
05:20:00,820 --> 05:20:02,440
I was like, where do I go?

4227
05:20:03,150 --> 05:20:04,340
You can't...

4228
05:20:04,340 --> 05:20:04,760
Okay.

4229
05:20:05,300 --> 05:20:06,460
Okay, we'll just...

4230
05:20:06,460 --> 05:20:07,900
I had to go down anyway.

4231
05:20:09,360 --> 05:20:09,960
Okay.

4232
05:20:10,420 --> 05:20:13,140
It's for bosses, Toki.

4233
05:20:17,660 --> 05:20:20,340
The beast does not need direction.

4234
05:20:23,040 --> 05:20:24,080
It's true.

4235
05:20:24,520 --> 05:20:25,380
It's so true.

4236
05:20:25,660 --> 05:20:30,500
The beast need not need to know where to go.

4237
05:20:31,300 --> 05:20:32,480
The beast's hungers.

4238
05:20:32,820 --> 05:20:33,700
Isn't that right?

4239
05:20:36,140 --> 05:20:40,320
The real gamers know where they are without the compass.

4240
05:20:42,700 --> 05:20:43,560
I was like wondering.

4241
05:20:43,660 --> 05:20:45,920
I was like, where the fuck do I go?

4242
05:20:47,660 --> 05:21:05,840
okay left down right okay oh yeah i get the oh what the fuck guys guys chill out

4243
05:21:10,460 --> 05:21:22,480
okay there is a lot the people are like oh why don't you go there there's a lot of areas that are locked up right now I'm not very behind at the moment.

4244
05:21:26,390 --> 05:21:27,750
Because we had our little intermission.

4245
05:21:28,330 --> 05:21:31,570
I think every other boss now is going to be easier.

4246
05:21:33,790 --> 05:21:35,910
After what I had to deal with.

4247
05:21:36,430 --> 05:21:40,470
A lot of bosses are going to be a lot easier than the fucking beast.

4248
05:21:48,320 --> 05:21:49,860
Than the goddamn...

4249
05:21:49,860 --> 05:21:51,960
Oh my god, that stupid lava.

4250
05:21:52,760 --> 05:21:54,580
I forgot to like, do this.

4251
05:21:58,980 --> 05:21:59,300
Okay.

4252
05:22:02,320 --> 05:22:03,420
What the fuck?

4253
05:22:05,820 --> 05:22:06,620
What's the...

4254
05:22:06,620 --> 05:22:08,920
I think that one was a wall jump, right?

4255
05:22:09,060 --> 05:22:10,200
Okay, wait.

4256
05:22:13,270 --> 05:22:14,410
Yeah, definitely an...

4257
05:22:14,410 --> 05:22:15,270
Yeah, I knew it.

4258
05:22:15,270 --> 05:22:16,410
I knew I couldn't go up there.

4259
05:22:17,190 --> 05:22:19,090
I had a feeling it was a wall jump.

4260
05:22:20,630 --> 05:22:21,710
Hey, get me out of this guy.

4261
05:22:22,070 --> 05:22:22,670
Get me out of here.

4262
05:22:23,790 --> 05:22:24,810
Get me out of here.

4263
05:22:27,270 --> 05:22:27,670
Wee.

4264
05:22:28,190 --> 05:22:28,590
Wee.

4265
05:22:31,650 --> 05:22:34,090
All right, where does this go again?

4266
05:22:34,510 --> 05:22:34,670
Okay.

4267
05:22:39,030 --> 05:22:41,310
Oh, it's supposed to go up here.

4268
05:22:42,610 --> 05:22:44,290
Oh my god.

4269
05:22:47,250 --> 05:22:47,530
Ah!

4270
05:22:49,770 --> 05:22:50,170
Ah!

4271
05:22:51,790 --> 05:22:52,230
Ah!

4272
05:22:53,970 --> 05:22:54,410
Ah!

4273
05:22:55,890 --> 05:22:58,030
Oh my god.

4274
05:23:00,590 --> 05:23:02,330
I was...

4275
05:23:02,330 --> 05:23:05,030
I was supposed to be up here.

4276
05:23:13,190 --> 05:23:15,970
We lost players.

4277
05:23:17,190 --> 05:23:21,610
I did like the fucking wildest intermission possible.

4278
05:23:25,530 --> 05:23:27,930
I sound so sane, right?

4279
05:23:28,030 --> 05:23:55,810
now after everything i've been what the fuck are you guys playing baseball like what are you doing am i interrupting some baseball they're like we're trying to play baseball this is our baseball practice rude oh my sorry okay

4280
05:23:59,190 --> 05:24:02,470
to be fair it is my fault i did interrupt her baseball.

4281
05:24:03,170 --> 05:24:04,810
Get off the field.

4282
05:24:07,750 --> 05:24:11,510
I was like, no hobbies allowed.

4283
05:24:12,150 --> 05:24:16,650
If I can't have fun, nobody can have fun.

4284
05:24:18,710 --> 05:24:20,490
Rip do something.

4285
05:24:21,170 --> 05:24:22,970
She's on the field.

4286
05:24:24,070 --> 05:24:25,690
That's fucking right.

4287
05:24:28,090 --> 05:24:30,470
No one can have fun.

4288
05:24:33,810 --> 05:24:35,450
I'm still so sad.

4289
05:24:35,610 --> 05:24:36,630
I can't believe.

4290
05:24:38,190 --> 05:24:41,310
I still can't believe I missed it.

4291
05:24:43,570 --> 05:24:44,650
Oh my god.

4292
05:24:52,480 --> 05:24:52,940
There we go.

4293
05:24:54,520 --> 05:24:56,480
Now what you're gonna do with one pitcher?

4294
05:24:56,580 --> 05:24:58,800
You can't play catch with just by yourself.

4295
05:24:59,600 --> 05:25:01,120
That's fucking right.

4296
05:25:02,140 --> 05:25:02,880
Is that it?

4297
05:25:03,900 --> 05:25:05,160
Is this supposed to be lore?

4298
05:25:06,980 --> 05:25:37,800
what am i supposed to do maybe if i there you go no that's just a lore room apparently i still yeah it was literally like they're just here trying to play catch and i just went to kill him you monster the day baseball disappeared from the kingdom yeah oh you have held tight to fate having carried further the station Shall offer a brief rest to those devout.

4299
05:25:38,020 --> 05:25:38,800
Oh, nice.

4300
05:25:39,500 --> 05:25:40,060
Sing, then.

4301
05:25:40,840 --> 05:25:42,220
Don't despair, pilgrims.

4302
05:25:42,700 --> 05:25:43,060
Run.

4303
05:25:43,580 --> 05:25:45,640
Lift your sight and raise your voice.

4304
05:25:45,940 --> 05:25:47,540
Have no fear, pilgrim.

4305
05:25:47,820 --> 05:25:48,320
True.

4306
05:25:48,920 --> 05:25:51,080
Believing is a happy choice.

4307
05:25:51,580 --> 05:25:53,060
Oh, that should get rid of my...

4308
05:25:54,060 --> 05:25:55,560
My son's eyes.

4309
05:25:56,040 --> 05:25:56,620
Holy there.

4310
05:25:57,020 --> 05:25:58,420
Aren't those fields marvelous?

4311
05:25:58,820 --> 05:26:00,880
And above us are your bountiful moors.

4312
05:26:01,340 --> 05:26:04,040
Where every pilgrim can fill their belly.

4313
05:26:05,680 --> 05:26:07,880
These hot fields are a wonder indeed.

4314
05:26:08,340 --> 05:26:10,580
The hunter's proud, the long grass.

4315
05:26:11,500 --> 05:26:13,740
Praying your instruments will only alert them to your presence.

4316
05:26:14,220 --> 05:26:16,120
Well then, alert them I shall!

4317
05:26:16,440 --> 05:26:19,200
For when many gathered, great songs are sung.

4318
05:26:21,020 --> 05:26:23,560
These poor traveler finds her resolve moaning.

4319
05:26:24,020 --> 05:26:29,160
When I first greeted her, her voice was so scarcely, I harshly, scarcely heard it.

4320
05:26:29,420 --> 05:26:30,900
There's no cause for worry, though.

4321
05:26:31,120 --> 05:26:33,580
My song will lift her from her to a prayer.

4322
05:26:33,920 --> 05:26:35,140
Join your voice with mine.

4323
05:26:35,160 --> 05:26:38,800
Red Maiden, together we shall rouse our fellow pilgrims!

4324
05:26:55,260 --> 05:26:58,600
Alright, chair.

4325
05:27:01,360 --> 05:27:01,880
What are you?

4326
05:27:02,140 --> 05:27:04,260
I'm gonna rest your...

4327
05:27:04,260 --> 05:27:04,540
Mort!

4328
05:27:05,160 --> 05:27:39,760
worry body the climb is agonizing and even the devout must mind your limits i'm impressed to find any without firm claw my weapon that could ascend so far indeed we are very lucky to have made here luckier than many others or perhaps the difference between a lucky and unlucky is merely fate now while you rest shall we make a trade and if you have rosaries i'll gladly I'll take them gladly.

4329
05:27:42,680 --> 05:27:43,800
Or reinstruct yourself.

4330
05:27:43,980 --> 05:27:44,460
You'll be with me.

4331
05:27:44,640 --> 05:27:46,680
Oh, this is steady body.

4332
05:27:49,480 --> 05:27:49,920
Um.

4333
05:27:51,380 --> 05:27:52,400
I can add some pockets.

4334
05:27:52,580 --> 05:27:54,840
What do I do to use shards for?

4335
05:28:00,060 --> 05:28:02,460
I can add some pockets to the camera to us.

4336
05:28:02,660 --> 05:28:03,900
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

4337
05:28:12,410 --> 05:28:12,850
Okay.

4338
05:28:15,170 --> 05:28:15,950
Oh, we could.

4339
05:28:16,050 --> 05:28:16,750
Wait, let me...

4340
05:28:16,750 --> 05:28:16,990
Okay.

4341
05:28:18,850 --> 05:28:20,570
Okay, let me...

4342
05:28:20,570 --> 05:28:22,450
Do I have, like, those Rosary Beasts?

4343
05:28:22,590 --> 05:28:23,430
No, I do not.

4344
05:28:29,790 --> 05:28:32,150
I want to buy memories, so I...

4345
05:28:33,110 --> 05:28:34,450
I'll get Poise.

4346
05:28:36,070 --> 05:28:36,750
I grab that.

4347
05:28:38,130 --> 05:28:42,670
And it'll be like, you don't have memory to put your poison on me, like, oh, fuck me, I guess.

4348
05:28:43,410 --> 05:28:44,510
I fucking knew it.

4349
05:28:48,590 --> 05:28:50,910
I fucking knew it.

4350
05:28:51,130 --> 05:28:52,990
I fucking knew it.

4351
05:28:56,810 --> 05:28:58,530
I was like, oh, they're gonna say that.

4352
05:28:58,790 --> 05:28:59,770
Don't earn it.

4353
05:29:00,030 --> 05:29:00,450
They're gonna...

4354
05:29:05,690 --> 05:29:06,250
Funny.

4355
05:29:07,350 --> 05:29:08,990
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

4356
05:29:09,470 --> 05:29:10,810
I have a feeling.

4357
05:29:11,670 --> 05:29:13,610
Nice upgrade, don't you?

4358
05:29:16,570 --> 05:29:17,450
Wait, what?

4359
05:29:25,360 --> 05:29:25,700
What?

4360
05:29:29,620 --> 05:29:31,480
Oh, I thought that was a breakable wall.

4361
05:29:31,780 --> 05:29:34,060
There's something on the other side.

4362
05:29:34,280 --> 05:29:35,240
You guys heard that?

4363
05:29:37,760 --> 05:29:38,060
Oh, you see?

4364
05:29:38,060 --> 05:29:38,720

And I float.

4373
05:30:56,740 --> 05:30:58,340
God, I look so goofy.

4374
05:30:59,040 --> 05:31:04,880
I just look so goofy whenever I float.

4375
05:31:05,100 --> 05:31:06,160
I love it.

4376
05:31:06,740 --> 05:31:07,400
Wee.

4377
05:31:10,040 --> 05:31:10,880
Oh my.

4378
05:31:11,080 --> 05:31:12,340
Get out of here!

4379
05:31:16,200 --> 05:31:17,100
God, I cannot.

4380
05:31:17,120 --> 05:31:31,600
wait to get nail upgrades and you'd be like nothing to me it's cute but it's also goofy for her because i would see this more for that whoa oh is this a gray more wait gray more

4381
05:31:44,580 --> 05:31:45,940
wait what

4382
05:31:50,770 --> 05:31:59,330
isn't that like whoa oh you need a map

4383
05:32:03,810 --> 05:32:04,890
Oh, yeah.

4384
05:32:07,090 --> 05:32:07,630
Nice view.

4385
05:32:08,050 --> 05:32:09,230
Very greeting, Shakara.

4386
05:32:09,870 --> 05:32:10,350
Shakira.

4387
05:32:11,730 --> 05:32:14,630
You're welcome, Sayamist, to sod and gloom of these caverns.

4388
05:32:14,870 --> 05:32:15,730
Baby, don't.

4389
05:32:15,850 --> 05:32:17,010
Child-wielding needle.

4390
05:32:17,610 --> 05:32:19,090
Your aspect is still sharp.

4391
05:32:19,730 --> 05:32:21,270
My respect remains.

4392
05:32:21,890 --> 05:32:22,710
Heed a warning.

4393
05:32:23,210 --> 05:32:25,210
Many fierce bugs roost nearby.

4394
05:32:25,830 --> 05:32:30,190
On the lake beyond this cave nest, a ragged horde, atop an old watermelon.

4395
05:32:30,190 --> 05:32:32,950
Their mastery of flight makes them dangerous.

4396
05:32:33,490 --> 05:32:36,030
My shell will very carry the score of their pins.

4397
05:32:37,590 --> 05:32:41,270
If you're seeking a safer path, head back towards this land core.

4398
05:32:42,150 --> 05:32:43,110
Okay, I have no money.

4399
05:32:43,290 --> 05:32:44,390
I'm broke, Shakira.

4400
05:32:45,610 --> 05:32:47,530
The other man took my money.

4401
05:32:50,030 --> 05:32:52,390
Okay, but she's basically Shakira.

4402
05:33:00,040 --> 05:33:00,680
Isn't...

4403
05:33:00,680 --> 05:33:01,700
Wait, what's this?

4404
05:33:02,420 --> 05:33:03,040
Insert rosary?

4405
05:33:03,280 --> 05:33:04,900
God damn it, I'm broke every...

4406
05:33:04,920 --> 05:33:05,400
everywhere.

4407
05:33:05,700 --> 05:33:05,980
The hat?

4408
05:33:06,180 --> 05:33:06,980
What is that?

4409
05:33:08,300 --> 05:33:09,600
Oh, thank God.

4410
05:33:10,600 --> 05:33:11,140
Cultists.

4411
05:33:12,440 --> 05:33:13,900
Just what I need.

4412
05:33:17,920 --> 05:33:18,060
Oh.

4413
05:33:19,420 --> 05:33:21,460
Too bad there's no life, guys.

4414
05:33:23,220 --> 05:33:24,820
That's so unfortunate.

4415
05:33:27,580 --> 05:33:28,560
Oh, I can swim, too.

4416
05:33:28,880 --> 05:33:29,140
Yay!

4417
05:33:32,260 --> 05:33:33,720
Sucks to be dumb.

4418
05:33:34,080 --> 05:33:34,580
Yay!

4419
05:33:38,840 --> 05:33:40,380
Sucks to be you.

4420
05:33:44,910 --> 05:33:45,890
That's over here.

4421
05:33:47,690 --> 05:33:48,790
Oh, it's locked.

4422
05:33:49,670 --> 05:33:51,070
Everything is locked.

4423
05:33:52,470 --> 05:33:53,430
No service.

4424
05:33:56,450 --> 05:33:58,190
Okay, I don't really want to go back over.

4425
05:33:58,410 --> 05:33:58,790
Whoa!

4426
05:33:58,970 --> 05:33:59,850
They fight back.

4427
05:34:00,250 --> 05:34:01,710
Okay, I actually need a...

4428
05:34:04,310 --> 05:34:05,790
Okay, we gotta reset this.

4429
05:34:05,830 --> 05:34:06,810
I'm gonna farm these people.

4430
05:34:13,830 --> 05:34:15,390
All right, we gotta go back.

4431
05:34:15,630 --> 05:34:16,530
Wait, is there a bench near?

4432
05:34:16,590 --> 05:34:17,250
Oh, my God.

4433
05:34:17,950 --> 05:34:19,570
Wait, there's no bench nearby, right?

4434
05:34:20,910 --> 05:34:23,870
I have to go all the way down for the bench.

4435
05:34:25,330 --> 05:34:27,150
Oh, my God.

4436
05:34:31,330 --> 05:34:35,130
Shakira, do you know where the benches are?

4437
05:34:39,180 --> 05:34:40,600
Oh, I can't go back.

4438
05:34:41,680 --> 05:34:41,960
Oh.

4439
05:34:43,100 --> 05:34:44,480
Oh, I messed up.

4440
05:34:48,520 --> 05:34:50,180
I messed up.

4441
05:34:51,340 --> 05:34:53,420
She told me not to go that way.

4442
05:34:54,340 --> 05:34:54,740
Oh, yeah.

4443
05:34:55,000 --> 05:34:56,080
Oh, there's a bench next.

4444
05:34:56,160 --> 05:34:57,640
I forgot that's a bench.

4445
05:35:01,700 --> 05:35:03,220
I still messed up, though.

4446
05:35:04,080 --> 05:35:05,600
Shakira was like, don't go that way.

4447
05:35:05,960 --> 05:35:06,880
And I was like, okay.

4448
05:35:07,500 --> 05:35:08,260
Oh, I got it.

4449
05:35:08,280 --> 05:35:08,520
Yes.

4450
05:35:10,100 --> 05:35:12,880
It doesn't, it's because this doesn't look like a bench, so I forgot.

4451
05:35:14,480 --> 05:35:16,060
And how much money did I get?

4452
05:35:17,980 --> 05:35:18,420
64.

4453
05:35:19,220 --> 05:35:19,440
I didn't.

4454
05:35:19,460 --> 05:35:21,320
I need, like, 70?

4455
05:35:24,760 --> 05:35:25,420
Alright.

4456
05:35:25,860 --> 05:35:26,960
I can't farm him.

4457
05:35:30,920 --> 05:35:33,360
I also need, like, 100 so I can buy the...

4458
05:35:33,360 --> 05:35:34,960
I assume the fast travel.

4459
05:35:40,660 --> 05:35:42,820
I actually need you alive.

4460
05:35:44,160 --> 05:35:44,460
Alright.

4461
05:35:44,800 --> 05:35:45,260
83.

4462
05:35:48,940 --> 05:35:49,340
Alright.

4463
05:35:50,480 --> 05:35:51,280
Oh, shit.

4464
05:35:51,820 --> 05:35:52,000
Whoa!

4465
05:35:52,300 --> 05:35:52,720
A paco.

4466
05:35:54,180 --> 05:35:55,380
We need the...

4467
05:35:55,380 --> 05:35:56,300
We got the map.

4468
05:36:03,220 --> 05:36:26,980
I feel like okay we have to farm so much in silk song compared to before in hollow night I felt like there was less farming there's so much farming in this game for currency compared to like silk compared to a hollow night that's how it feels so far.

4469
05:36:29,940 --> 05:36:31,520
Oh my, that was my bet.

4470
05:36:32,300 --> 05:36:33,440
I was just taking it.

4471
05:36:34,860 --> 05:36:35,220
Really?

4472
05:36:35,680 --> 05:36:39,700
I didn't have to farm that much in Hollow Knight.

4473
05:36:47,630 --> 05:36:48,490
There you go.

4474
05:36:52,410 --> 05:36:53,750
All right, here you go.

4475
05:36:56,710 --> 05:36:57,190
Is that enough?

4476
05:36:58,390 --> 05:36:59,370
I can't, I don't remember.

4477
05:37:00,230 --> 05:37:00,710
52.

4478
05:37:01,110 --> 05:37:03,090
How much for this?

4479
05:37:05,930 --> 05:37:06,950
Okay, we got to sit in the bench.

4480
05:37:12,510 --> 05:37:12,530
Alright.

4481
05:37:13,430 --> 05:37:14,590
There's a lot of stuff.

4482
05:37:14,650 --> 05:37:16,610
There's a lot of gear this time around.

4483
05:37:22,370 --> 05:37:23,230
Then we're gonna lock that.

4484
05:37:28,010 --> 05:37:28,850
Oh, almost.

4485
05:37:29,050 --> 05:37:29,210
Okay.

4486
05:37:29,430 --> 05:37:30,250
That was like, I don't want to drop.

4487
05:37:30,350 --> 05:37:31,530
Don't drop into the pit!

4488
05:37:31,790 --> 05:37:32,150
Doki!

4489
05:37:37,760 --> 05:37:38,720
Okay, I need 80.

4490
05:37:40,120 --> 05:37:41,240
and grab 80 from.

4491
05:37:41,960 --> 05:37:43,880
Okay, I need to get closer so I can farm you.

4492
05:37:44,580 --> 05:37:46,700
I don't want your bees to fall into the ocean.

4493
05:37:47,080 --> 05:37:48,180
You're much... Oh, hey, secret.

4494
05:37:48,260 --> 05:37:48,640
Okay, wait.

4495
05:37:49,200 --> 05:37:50,020
There's secret there.

4496
05:37:51,040 --> 05:37:54,440
Alright, after I farm in, unlock fast travel, I go to secret.

4497
05:37:59,990 --> 05:38:00,690
There you go.

4498
05:38:03,550 --> 05:38:04,430
Okay, now.

4499
05:38:09,100 --> 05:38:11,960
Now I go back and I buy fast travel.

4500
05:38:13,000 --> 05:38:13,380
Hello.

4501
05:38:13,680 --> 05:38:14,400
Take my money.

4502
05:38:21,920 --> 05:38:22,720
Oh.

4503
05:38:26,880 --> 05:38:29,180
All right, that was a waste of my time.

4504
05:38:33,290 --> 05:38:33,870
Oh.

4505
05:38:36,730 --> 05:38:37,530
Okay.

4506
05:38:38,450 --> 05:38:39,130
All right.

4507
05:38:39,850 --> 05:38:41,290
I guess that's what it was.

4508
05:38:41,970 --> 05:38:42,610
I guess.

4509
05:38:43,790 --> 05:38:44,450
I guess.

4510
05:38:44,890 --> 05:38:45,270
Wow.

4511
05:38:45,790 --> 05:38:46,190
Okay.

4512
05:38:50,210 --> 05:38:52,450
It was just a string.

4513
05:38:55,030 --> 05:38:55,630
Nothing?

4514
05:38:57,070 --> 05:38:57,690
What?

4515
05:38:58,690 --> 05:39:00,650
Why would this be a hidden cavern?

4516
05:39:02,870 --> 05:39:04,210
Such a weird area.

4517
05:39:08,490 --> 05:39:09,130
Alright.

4518
05:39:09,710 --> 05:39:10,270
That's cool.

4519
05:39:11,350 --> 05:39:11,610
Alright.

4520
05:39:11,910 --> 05:39:12,150
Up.

4521
05:39:12,550 --> 05:39:13,890
Oh my god.

4522
05:39:14,210 --> 05:39:14,510
Okay.

4523
05:39:15,050 --> 05:39:16,510
Let's figure this out.

4524
05:39:23,920 --> 05:39:28,360
I do think this parkour is more difficult than Hollow Knight.

4525
05:39:28,480 --> 05:39:30,500
The parkour segment only becomes...

4526
05:39:30,520 --> 05:39:36,040
Because, like, some of the areas you have to, like, it's definitely, like, the dash.

4527
05:39:36,180 --> 05:39:37,340
This is a test of reaction.

4528
05:39:38,500 --> 05:39:40,340
I'd say it's, like, the dash stuff, too.

4529
05:39:48,290 --> 05:39:49,570
It's a side dash.

4530
05:39:53,740 --> 05:39:55,060
Oh, my God.

4531
05:40:00,040 --> 05:40:02,800
I don't know yet, but I want to...

4532
05:40:02,800 --> 05:40:06,320
Jesus Christ, these enemies are fucking horrible!

4533
05:40:09,060 --> 05:40:09,760
There we go.

4534
05:40:16,450 --> 05:40:17,410
I'm okay.

4535
05:40:19,330 --> 05:40:22,210
And there's, like, some parkour where you have to run, jump.

4536
05:40:22,910 --> 05:40:26,330
Which is different from, like, what people are used to, maybe.

4537
05:40:30,550 --> 05:40:32,050
Har, well met, traveler.

4538
05:40:32,430 --> 05:40:34,750
Looking for a drink or a rest or both?

4539
05:40:36,410 --> 05:40:37,870
Fair greetings, good...

4540
05:40:37,870 --> 05:40:39,250
Fair greetings, good, bud.

4541
05:40:39,690 --> 05:40:42,410
The warmth of your hearth is welcome upon those wet-paint lambs.

4542
05:40:42,430 --> 05:40:45,550
Aye, it's a damp climb through these parts.

4543
05:40:46,130 --> 05:40:53,310
Used to be just pilgrims trekking my way, but odd times these are, and you ain't even the strangest shell wandering about.

4544
05:40:54,190 --> 05:41:02,570
A rowdy old warrior stopped through not long back, cause quite a scene, and now a young's last taken up lodging in my top room.

4545
05:41:03,530 --> 05:41:08,230
The less my thought, the less mention she's on the lookout for sharp tights like yourself.

4546
05:41:08,710 --> 05:41:11,630
Maybe pay her a visit, if you haven't already.

4547
05:41:13,390 --> 05:41:44,510
care for a drink traveler my nectar's got a kick that'll warm your shell in these Sodom chimes sure I'll have a lot money anyway what's it do few stronger pilgrims I survived to reach my home now barlooms curse claims the rest poor sods left to wonder I do sometimes get to wondering is the Dregs of their own mind and they're keeping walking or something else entirely.

4548
05:41:45,790 --> 05:41:47,250
You didn't even have to look at my license.

4549
05:41:50,950 --> 05:41:51,930
Oh, I opened the door.

4550
05:41:52,970 --> 05:41:54,410
Oh, I got silk out of that.

4551
05:41:54,630 --> 05:41:55,110
Look at that.

4552
05:41:56,390 --> 05:41:58,110
He didn't ask for my license.

4553
05:42:01,250 --> 05:42:01,650
Oh, okay.

4554
05:42:01,690 --> 05:42:02,650
That's the thing to sell.

4555
05:42:03,510 --> 05:42:04,290
The bone scrub.

4556
05:42:04,490 --> 05:42:06,190
What the fuck is that?

4557
05:42:10,210 --> 05:42:12,130
So you're surprised for Nu?

4558
05:42:13,210 --> 05:42:14,330
You're an adult, yes?

4559
05:42:14,830 --> 05:42:15,470
Fully grown?

4560
05:42:16,190 --> 05:42:17,010
Ready to hunt?

4561
05:42:17,890 --> 05:42:20,710
Certainly, I am the child, young one.

4562
05:42:22,530 --> 05:42:23,650
Perfect, then.

4563
05:42:24,190 --> 05:42:25,390
Nu must ask a wish.

4564
05:42:25,850 --> 05:42:30,590
For her, Nu would seek Farlum's many fabulous bugs and cut them.

4565
05:42:31,010 --> 05:42:33,430
Cut them with your blade and cut them with your mature spear.

4566
05:42:33,850 --> 05:42:35,550
Cut them with your savage adult heart.

4567
05:42:36,210 --> 05:42:36,930
Would you help Nu?

4568
05:42:37,290 --> 05:42:42,270
Could you take a scroll and fill as pages of learnings Oh, she, okay.

4569
05:42:43,970 --> 05:42:45,010
She a little...

4570
05:42:46,970 --> 05:42:48,790
No, not right in the head.

4571
05:42:51,090 --> 05:42:51,550
Oh, my!

4572
05:42:51,750 --> 05:42:52,950
You make me so happy!

4573
05:42:53,390 --> 05:42:56,730
Hug down the creatures of this land and record them in the script!

4574
05:42:57,470 --> 05:42:58,590
Oh, she's...

4575
05:42:58,590 --> 05:43:00,390
Yeah, she's a little intense, guys.

4576
05:43:00,730 --> 05:43:02,570
Just a little intense.

4577
05:43:04,770 --> 05:43:06,050
Oh, this is not...

4578
05:43:06,050 --> 05:43:07,030
No, I'm the hunter journal.

4579
05:43:07,510 --> 05:43:09,990
Learning about lands and habits is a worthwhile undertaking.

4580
05:43:10,010 --> 05:43:12,570
And perhaps you're more grown than you realize, new?

4581
05:43:13,410 --> 05:43:13,850
My?

4582
05:43:14,510 --> 05:43:16,730
Such a list of space will make new trouble.

4583
05:43:17,050 --> 05:43:20,010
Go now, art, and pray, and begin our learning.

4584
05:43:20,390 --> 05:43:22,750
Yeah, she's very forward, guys.

4585
05:43:22,990 --> 05:43:25,150
Just a little.

4586
05:43:28,710 --> 05:43:31,330
Dude, he's just a little freaky.

4587
05:43:31,710 --> 05:43:32,150
Oh, what?

4588
05:43:33,030 --> 05:43:33,570
Oh.

4589
05:43:34,250 --> 05:43:35,390
What the fuck?

4590
05:43:44,150 --> 05:43:44,690
Okay.

4591
05:43:44,990 --> 05:43:45,070
Okay.

4592
05:43:47,330 --> 05:43:49,810
Oh, wait, they're dead originally.

4593
05:43:50,810 --> 05:43:51,410
What the fuck?

4594
05:43:51,530 --> 05:43:51,730
Okay.

4595
05:43:52,990 --> 05:43:54,430
So they were originally dead.

4596
05:43:54,970 --> 05:43:55,710
And then the thread.

4597
05:43:55,950 --> 05:43:57,310
Oh, they're like getting puppeteered.

05:43:58,690 --> 05:43:59,210

4599
05:43:59,210 --> 05:44:00,870
What the fuck?

4600
05:44:01,390 --> 05:44:03,490
Okay, these guys are crazy.

This one's weird.

4603
05:44:06,630 --> 05:44:09,450

4604
05:44:18,300 --> 05:44:18,840
Okay.

4605
05:44:20,300 --> 05:44:22,280

05:49:31,260 --> 05:49:33,820
I really don't like this area.

4674
05:49:39,700 --> 05:49:42,000
I'll make sure I got everything around here.

4675
05:49:46,590 --> 05:49:48,250
Okay, this has to be a shortcut, right?

4676
05:49:51,560 --> 05:49:53,200
Where is this area?

05:49:53,860 --> 05:49:55,020

Did he just walk there himself before I got there?

4688
05:50:32,000 --> 05:50:35,260
Okay, there's a shortcut here, but I can't get there yet.

4689

05:54:50,940 --> 05:54:52,860
Okay, we have to go to the secret then.

4732
05:55:00,430 --> 05:55:01,890

4739
05:56:10,550 --> 05:56:15,870
Oopsie Oopsie Sorry, I was thinking about the beast.

4740
05:56:20,130 --> 05:56:20,570
Yeah.

4741
05:56:24,710 --> 05:56:26,390
Are you serious?

4742
05:56:29,070 --> 05:56:29,390
Okay.

4743
05:56:44,300 --> 05:56:44,560
Alright.

4744
05:56:45,920 --> 05:56:46,220
Nope.

4745
05:56:46,660 --> 05:56:49,300
Okay, because the dash is a little different.

4746
05:56:50,040 --> 05:56:51,080
Oh, what?

4747
05:56:52,620 --> 05:56:54,160
Beast mode.

4748
05:57:01,920 --> 05:57:03,520
The beast hungers!

4749
05:57:10,980 --> 05:57:12,440
The beast hungers!

4750
05:57:13,420 --> 05:57:16,980
Oh my

4751
05:57:20,940 --> 05:57:21,240

05:57:23,740 --> 05:57:24,400
Wait, what?

4753
05:57:26,680 --> 05:57:27,440
Wait, what?

4754
05:57:27,680 --> 05:57:29,180
He can cancel it?

4755
05:57:31,280 --> 05:57:32,700
Cancel my thing!

4756
05:57:32,800 --> 05:57:33,820
I didn't realize!

4757
05:57:35,180 --> 05:57:37,140
He cancels the beast!

4758
05:57:38,080 --> 05:57:38,520
Yeah!

4759
05:57:40,180 --> 05:57:42,080
He cancels it!

4760
05:57:42,320 --> 05:57:42,760
No!

4761
05:57:44,460 --> 05:57:49,280
How can I hunger if he cancels my hunger?

4762
05:57:51,160 --> 05:57:53,880
How else can I be hungry?

4763
05:57:55,040 --> 05:57:56,900
Oh, beasted the beast.

4764
05:57:59,760 --> 05:58:53,220
The downslash is a little it's not like exactly like a downslash it's a oh my gosh oh my god oh my I did not expect all these little guys I'm trying to remember how to get back all right we got the beast has to eat the beast has oh my god okay the beast is gonna die it's too dark the beast is scared now the beast is very scared I don't think I have that much money on me no I don't thank God I spent it all I remember now thank God I actually don't have a lot of money so if I die I don't have to worry too much

4766
05:59:04,460 --> 05:59:06,240

4767
05:59:21,520 --> 05:59:21,620
Ah!

4768
05:59:23,240 --> 05:59:25,420

So hungry!

4770
05:59:33,580 --> 05:59:34,700
You hear it?

4771
05:59:34,740 --> 05:59:35,660
That way she goes, Ah!

4772
05:59:39,000 --> 05:59:39,900
Bees hungry.

4773
05:59:40,940 --> 05:59:43,040
I think that vampirism is nice, though.

4774
05:59:43,120 --> 05:59:45,100
Where the fuck is my... Oh, there it is.

4775
05:59:45,980 --> 05:59:47,680
I was like, where is it?

4776
05:59:56,680 --> 05:59:56,960
Okay.

4777
06:00:00,550 --> 06:00:01,870
All right, locking in.

4778
06:00:04,830 --> 06:00:05,210
Okay.

4779
06:00:06,090 --> 06:00:06,390
What?

4780
06:00:13,550 --> 06:00:13,850
Okay.

4781
06:00:14,430 --> 06:00:14,910
That's good.

4782
06:00:20,960 --> 06:00:21,380
All right.

4783
06:00:23,560 --> 06:00:25,120
The beast continues to hunger.

4784
06:00:30,190 --> 06:00:30,530
All right.

4785
06:00:30,670 --> 06:00:31,950
Yeah, it's like a Sonic Dash.

4786
06:00:32,130 --> 06:00:34,090
You guys recognize it?

4787
06:00:34,330 --> 06:00:34,610
Wait.

4788
06:00:37,730 --> 06:00:40,550
You guys notice that it's like a Sonic Dash?

4789
06:00:47,720 --> 06:00:49,000
How did I get hurt there?

4790
06:00:55,210 --> 06:00:55,610
Okay.

4791
06:00:58,690 --> 06:01:01,510
Oh, there's so much to juke!

4792
06:01:07,150 --> 06:01:08,270
Oh my god.

4793
06:01:08,930 --> 06:01:09,330
Thank god.

4794
06:01:10,490 --> 06:01:11,670
I got the...

4795
06:01:11,670 --> 06:01:13,390
I got the life still in time.

4796
06:01:16,670 --> 06:01:17,230
What?!

4797
06:01:20,280 --> 06:01:20,560
Okay.

4798
06:01:26,260 --> 06:01:32,740
I- it's hard to hit the saws consistently only because it's a it's a tilt.

4799
06:01:33,560 --> 06:01:34,540
It's a little tilty.

4800
06:01:35,940 --> 06:01:36,380
Oh.

4801
06:01:38,680 --> 06:01:39,840
Yeah, I did it.

4802
06:01:39,900 --> 06:01:42,840
I'm getting used to the- I'm getting used to the downward slash though.

4803
06:01:44,240 --> 06:01:46,120
Like this tilt thing is a little weird.

4804
06:01:50,920 --> 06:01:52,880
I gotta be patient, yeah.

4805
06:01:53,880 --> 06:01:55,820
No, the saws do two damage.

4806
06:01:56,360 --> 06:01:58,020
Every move does two damage.

4807
06:02:00,420 --> 06:02:00,840
That was close.

4808
06:02:00,920 --> 06:02:02,160
I actually forgot about that trap.

4809
06:02:05,040 --> 06:02:08,380
I did indeed forgot about that trap.

4810
06:02:16,650 --> 06:02:17,390
You can't.

4811
06:02:17,690 --> 06:02:18,110
It's...

4812
06:02:18,110 --> 06:02:19,770
It's nearly...

4813
06:02:19,770 --> 06:02:21,390
It tilts like that.

4814
06:02:21,590 --> 06:02:23,890
I don't think there... Unless there's another...

4815
06:02:23,890 --> 06:02:54,950
another quest does all the jumps are tilts what oh bitch I'll have to all right remember this trap here yeah oh it can do three as well oh my god that's so frustrating I swear to God if this guy is not sorry I I swear to God.

4816
06:02:59,790 --> 06:03:01,270
I'm literally doing all the...

4817
06:03:01,270 --> 06:03:05,290
I'm like accidentally doing optional bosses at this point.

4818
06:03:09,170 --> 06:03:10,630
Okay, I don't know how that happened.

4819
06:03:16,780 --> 06:03:17,760
Alright, nice.

4820
06:03:18,700 --> 06:03:19,720
I needed that life steal.

4821
06:03:27,710 --> 06:03:28,190
Nice.

4822
06:03:29,890 --> 06:03:31,990
He fucking... Oh my...

4823
06:03:33,030 --> 06:03:36,850
He got up just the moment I needed him not to.

4824
06:03:40,820 --> 06:03:41,080
Yeah.

4825
06:03:44,460 --> 06:03:46,630
I'm too scared right now to...

4826
06:03:48,420 --> 06:03:50,240
to use my needle attack.

4827
06:03:54,150 --> 06:03:57,070
Because he just, he does so much at once.

4828
06:03:57,730 --> 06:03:58,870
Like, oh my god.

4829
06:03:59,270 --> 06:04:02,650
He has too many moves that do like a lot of damage.

4830
06:04:03,270 --> 06:04:04,050
Like this.

4831
06:04:04,170 --> 06:04:04,890
Oh fuck.

4832
06:04:08,110 --> 06:04:09,430
I gotta make sure.

4833
06:04:10,350 --> 06:04:11,450
Are you serious?

4834
06:04:13,550 --> 06:04:14,970
Oh my god.

4835
06:04:28,660 --> 06:04:29,940
Super saws.

4836
06:04:31,080 --> 06:04:31,660
Damn.

4837
06:04:34,000 --> 06:04:35,680
The goddamn saws.

4838
06:04:40,950 --> 06:04:41,250
Yeah.

4839
06:04:42,250 --> 06:04:44,750
At least like, I can sort of get back here.

4840
06:04:45,930 --> 06:04:47,670
I like the beast though.

4841
06:04:47,750 --> 06:04:48,710
I like the life seal.

4842
06:04:49,550 --> 06:04:50,130
It's...

4843
06:04:51,370 --> 06:04:53,550
It's very helpful, I think.

4844
06:04:57,920 --> 06:04:59,360
I'm not gonna go too fast.

4845
06:04:59,680 --> 06:05:01,260
If I go too fast, the rats get me.

4846
06:05:05,580 --> 06:05:07,160
I can hit the saws.

4847
06:05:08,120 --> 06:05:08,540
We'll see.

4848
06:05:12,460 --> 06:05:12,960
Alright.

4849
06:05:14,940 --> 06:05:16,840
Oh my god, I have to...

4850
06:05:17,720 --> 06:05:19,840
I have to try and life steal something.

4851
06:05:27,140 --> 06:05:28,140
Are you...

4852
06:05:28,140 --> 06:05:28,670
Are you...

4853
06:05:31,990 --> 06:05:33,510
Guys, this is bad.

4854
06:05:38,250 --> 06:05:39,930
The rats got me.

4855
06:05:40,810 --> 06:05:42,190
The rats got me.

4856
06:05:42,330 --> 06:05:42,990
I have one.

4857
06:05:43,050 --> 06:05:44,830
I technically have one HP.

4858
06:05:45,650 --> 06:05:47,470
Because this guy does two damage.

4859
06:05:55,930 --> 06:05:58,090
Okay, I got some of my HP back.

4860
06:05:58,810 --> 06:05:59,230
Thank God.

4861
06:06:00,130 --> 06:06:01,870
Okay, I'm going to try and lock in more.

4862
06:06:03,870 --> 06:06:05,130
with this one.

4863
06:06:08,590 --> 06:06:08,830
Yeah.

4864
06:06:13,530 --> 06:06:14,150
Okay.

4865
06:06:22,780 --> 06:06:23,180
Oh.

4866
06:06:28,160 --> 06:06:28,620
Okay.

4867
06:06:31,140 --> 06:06:34,680
That was such a risk to not use my...

4868
06:06:37,900 --> 06:06:38,820
Okay.

4869
06:06:46,770 --> 06:06:48,490
Are you... Oh my god!

4870
06:06:50,870 --> 06:06:51,410
Oh.

4871
06:07:01,700 --> 06:07:24,950
okay okay that's the team when he shoots the twice one i think you can parry it i just don't have it's so it goes so fast that i don't have time to like register

4872
06:07:30,180 --> 06:08:07,480
yeah it is like the the the sign when he does it um what's the the word like he what the fuck like his tell-tale his tell to like when to when he does that uh move is so it's such a the tell is really fast so that I really only have like one second to react to it and sometimes I don't have that second Where?

4873
06:08:11,260 --> 06:08:14,720
I don't want to run to that one because I knew I might get trapped.

4874
06:08:26,600 --> 06:08:26,980
Oh.

4875
06:08:34,910 --> 06:08:35,690
I have to use the bees.

4876
06:08:41,000 --> 06:08:42,100
I got my HP back.

4877
06:08:42,320 --> 06:08:42,720
Thank God.

4878
06:08:48,430 --> 06:08:48,770
Alright.

4879
06:08:51,290 --> 06:08:52,490
Okay, I parried it.

4880
06:08:52,810 --> 06:08:53,410
Thank God.

4881
06:08:57,860 --> 06:08:58,180
Yeah.

4882
06:09:00,140 --> 06:09:00,780
Oh.

4883
06:09:07,850 --> 06:09:09,270
Try my best to lock it.

4884
06:09:14,280 --> 06:09:16,000
Are you serious?

4885
06:09:17,980 --> 06:09:18,240
What?

4886
06:09:18,760 --> 06:09:18,980
Woo!

4887
06:09:19,220 --> 06:09:19,640
No!

4888
06:09:23,740 --> 06:09:25,080
I hate these saws.

4889
06:09:25,200 --> 06:09:26,460
I hate them so much.

4890
06:09:32,740 --> 06:09:33,160
Please.

4891
06:09:34,740 --> 06:09:35,000
Oh.

4892
06:09:46,560 --> 06:09:50,700
Jesus, guys, okay, give it to me straight.

4893
06:09:52,140 --> 06:09:54,300
He's an optional boss, isn't he?

4894
06:09:57,220 --> 06:09:59,960
Firestar, welcome to Tomato Fire, welcome.

4895
06:10:00,760 --> 06:10:02,240
He's optional, isn't he?

4896
06:10:02,820 --> 06:10:05,440
I fucking, I, oh, no.

4897
06:10:06,920 --> 06:10:08,740
We don't know.

4898
06:10:10,500 --> 06:10:11,660
Oh my god.

4899
06:10:15,010 --> 06:10:16,490
I need a note.

4900
06:10:18,370 --> 06:10:20,310
I need a note.

4901
06:10:20,970 --> 06:10:28,810
I need a note.

4902
06:10:28,810 --> 06:10:29,650
Okay.

4903
06:10:32,310 --> 06:10:32,450
Alright.

4904
06:10:36,980 --> 06:10:40,560
Do I have a shorter range too with this move?

4905
06:10:41,440 --> 06:10:42,500
I can't tell.

4906
06:10:44,000 --> 06:10:44,940
Because he's that beast.

4907
06:10:46,740 --> 06:10:47,720
Any knowers.

4908
06:10:48,500 --> 06:10:50,040
Any knowers in chat.

4909
06:10:50,500 --> 06:10:52,320
Is he optional?

4910
06:10:56,140 --> 06:10:57,880
This is very important.

4911
06:11:01,360 --> 06:11:01,800
Okay.

4912
06:11:04,760 --> 06:11:06,520
I think...

4913
06:11:06,520 --> 06:11:10,500
I think the range is shorter with the beast.

4914
06:11:11,840 --> 06:11:12,600
I'm pretty sure.

4915
06:11:17,570 --> 06:11:18,670
Okay, I can do that.

4916
06:11:23,590 --> 06:11:24,470
But...

4917
06:11:24,490 --> 06:11:25,610
Alright, I'm pushing back.

4918
06:11:25,750 --> 06:11:27,010
I don't want him to corner me.

4919
06:11:27,970 --> 06:11:28,810
There you go.

4920
06:11:31,210 --> 06:11:32,550
Oh my god.

4921
06:11:33,470 --> 06:11:37,550
I need to...

4922
06:11:42,530 --> 06:11:43,090
Yeah.

4923
06:11:44,410 --> 06:11:44,610
Okay.

4924
06:11:46,070 --> 06:11:48,010
Oh my god, thank god.

4925
06:11:51,730 --> 06:11:53,710
I need HP, really bad.

4926
06:11:56,030 --> 06:11:57,470
I need to use my vampirism.

4927
06:12:01,470 --> 06:12:02,650
That's close.

4928
06:12:06,090 --> 06:12:06,910
Oh my god.

4929
06:12:08,390 --> 06:12:08,510
Oh.

4930
06:12:09,250 --> 06:12:12,250
I couldn't use my fucking vampirism!

4931
06:12:26,590 --> 06:12:27,950
It's a goddamn curve.

4932
06:12:32,470 --> 06:12:32,830
No!

4933
06:12:33,610 --> 06:12:34,310
Oh god.

4934
06:12:37,330 --> 06:12:38,830
Okay, I need to go to the other side.

4935
06:12:45,040 --> 06:12:45,880
Fuck!

4936
06:12:48,580 --> 06:12:49,880
Oh, fuck!

4937
06:12:59,030 --> 06:13:00,370
That hits me!

4938
06:13:02,660 --> 06:13:04,320
That really hits me.

4939
06:13:06,080 --> 06:13:06,780
Okay.

4940
06:13:07,540 --> 06:13:08,300
That hits me.

4941
06:13:08,500 --> 06:13:09,420
Of course it does.

4942
06:13:10,920 --> 06:13:10,940
Oh!

4943
06:13:12,680 --> 06:13:14,580
That attack hits me.

4944
06:13:20,420 --> 06:13:22,640
Yeah, I thought I was safe.

4945
06:13:26,660 --> 06:13:27,820
I just thought I was safe.

4946
06:13:30,180 --> 06:13:32,020
She was, in fact, not safe.

4947
06:13:33,100 --> 06:13:33,960
getting this.

4948
06:13:34,860 --> 06:13:35,700
I'm getting better at it.

4949
06:13:35,920 --> 06:13:37,060
Oh, never mind.

4950
06:13:37,780 --> 06:13:40,960
Oh, I was about to jinx myself there.

4951
06:13:42,480 --> 06:13:43,980
I'm like a motorboat.

4952
06:13:49,920 --> 06:13:51,340
Oh, I wish there was a closer bench.

4953
06:13:53,420 --> 06:13:54,560
That's really it.

4954
06:13:55,800 --> 06:13:57,940
I wish there was a bench closer.

4955
06:13:58,500 --> 06:13:59,240
All right.

4956
06:14:13,700 --> 06:14:14,180
Okay.

4957
06:14:15,040 --> 06:14:16,180
Oh, I've got help from it.

4958
06:14:16,180 --> 06:14:16,740
It's too late.

4959
06:14:16,860 --> 06:14:17,720
I don't need no help.

4960
06:14:18,560 --> 06:14:19,600
It's too late.

4961
06:14:22,200 --> 06:14:24,340
Sometimes it's just too late.

4962
06:14:34,740 --> 06:14:40,050
I have to be so patient with him because he has so much anti-air.

4963
06:14:43,200 --> 06:14:43,860
Like...

4964
06:14:43,860 --> 06:14:44,780
There

4965
06:14:48,930 --> 06:14:49,970
you go.

4966
06:14:54,410 --> 06:14:54,710
Okay.

4967
06:14:56,150 --> 06:14:58,310
Is this move like the...

4968
06:15:01,950 --> 06:15:03,110
Oh, that's unlucky.

4969
06:15:03,550 --> 06:15:04,570
I'm not meaning to hit that.

4970
06:15:05,970 --> 06:15:06,750
Okay.

4971
06:15:12,700 --> 06:15:14,200
There you go.

4972
06:15:15,940 --> 06:15:17,020
Oh, you flew up.

4973
06:15:17,160 --> 06:15:17,940
Fucking bitch.

4974
06:15:27,460 --> 06:15:27,780
Okay.

4975
06:15:32,890 --> 06:15:35,330
Oh my- God damn it, the curve.

4976
06:15:42,950 --> 06:15:43,230
Oh.

4977
06:15:46,090 --> 06:15:46,870
Okay.

4978
06:15:48,910 --> 06:15:51,390
Are you- Oh my god.

4979
06:15:58,860 --> 06:15:59,320
Okay.

4980
06:16:02,650 --> 06:16:03,430
Okay.

4981
06:16:06,170 --> 06:16:08,770
Okay, that's good, that's good, that's good for me.

4982
06:16:12,500 --> 06:16:19,320
What I've noticed, too, with these bosses is that they have more staggers.

4983
06:16:19,540 --> 06:16:20,380
I don't know if you guys noticed.

4984
06:16:30,050 --> 06:16:31,130
Yippee-y-y-y-y, yippee-y, yippee-y.

4985
06:16:36,220 --> 06:16:37,300
It's over.

4986
06:16:37,740 --> 06:16:40,500
They require more staggers.

4987
06:16:40,740 --> 06:16:47,880
than usual oh we did it i don't know where i am because i took off my compass i

Don't worry, I'll help you.

4992
06:18:00,900 --> 06:18:02,700
Why are y'all just hanging there?

4993
06:18:04,080 --> 06:18:06,240
I assume that's the tram, right?

4994
06:18:10,480 --> 06:18:12,560
I don't even know if I'm supposed to be here.

4995
06:18:14,540 --> 06:18:16,920
I don't have money and I'm broke, too.

4996
06:18:18,660 --> 06:18:19,880
I'm just hanging out.

4997
06:18:25,860 --> 06:18:26,260
Hello?

4998
06:18:32,550 --> 06:18:33,110
Oh!

4999
06:18:34,230 --> 06:18:36,090
I don't think they're okay, guys.

5000
06:18:38,650 --> 06:18:39,910
Where do I go from here?

5001
06:18:41,830 --> 06:18:43,150
Oh, I knew it.

5002
06:18:43,530 --> 06:18:44,650
Never mind, it was nothing.

5003
06:18:45,570 --> 06:18:46,830
There was a platform here.

5004
06:18:47,030 --> 06:18:49,430
Oh, this door is gonna open.

5005
06:18:50,610 --> 06:18:51,470
I get it.

5006
06:18:51,570 --> 06:18:53,270
That's the door you have to open later.

5007
06:18:56,960 --> 06:18:59,700
Where are some cultists for me to...

5008
06:18:59,700 --> 06:19:00,940
Now where am I?

5009
06:19:01,600 --> 06:19:03,920
Shellwood, where the fuck am I?

5010
06:19:04,080 --> 06:19:05,360
Oh, it's these guys.

5011
06:19:05,380 --> 06:19:07,500
Oh, I hate these guys.

5012
06:19:07,800 --> 06:19:08,040
Ah!

5013
06:19:09,900 --> 06:19:11,240
Yeah, I hate these guys.

5014
06:19:11,440 --> 06:19:11,900
I'm gonna heal.

5015
06:19:13,000 --> 06:19:14,800
Alright, we are not going here.

5016
06:19:19,900 --> 06:19:21,220
We're not going to Shellwood.

5017
06:19:21,420 --> 06:19:23,380
I feel like I should explore more.

5018
06:19:25,520 --> 06:19:30,720
Yeah, they walk on water, and I can't hit water while in water.

5019
06:19:31,420 --> 06:19:33,400
Oh my god, it's the scuttlebug.

5020
06:19:34,240 --> 06:19:35,680
We're gonna do the scuttlebug.

5021
06:19:44,060 --> 06:19:45,680
Where am I supposed to...

5022
06:19:45,680 --> 06:19:48,060
Okay, now I guess we can go...

5023
06:19:50,500 --> 06:19:52,700
Alright, now we go to the other way.

5024
06:19:55,620 --> 06:19:57,520
Remember that other exit we went there?

5025
06:19:58,100 --> 06:19:59,380
Alright, now we go back.

5026
06:20:01,820 --> 06:20:03,040
We did our job.

5027
06:20:03,220 --> 06:20:05,420
Oh my god, I am...

5028
06:20:05,420 --> 06:20:06,520
Not okay.

5029
06:20:08,900 --> 06:20:10,680
At least she seemed like a...

5030
06:20:10,680 --> 06:20:11,640
At least I did a...

5031
06:20:11,640 --> 06:20:13,700
I think I did a story, boss.

5032
06:20:19,590 --> 06:20:22,090
And he's scurried away, Sarishka.

5033
06:20:23,410 --> 06:20:25,070
I don't know how to kill them.

5034
06:20:27,750 --> 06:20:28,630
Like I'm scared.

5035
06:20:30,730 --> 06:20:32,570
I'm so scared of this rat.

5036
06:20:35,290 --> 06:20:37,550
Oh my god, he does two damage.

5037
06:20:37,890 --> 06:20:40,090
Yeah, there's a reason why I was scared of you.

5038
06:20:45,370 --> 06:20:45,970
Jesus.

5039
06:20:49,990 --> 06:21:04,630
oh my god he blocks the only way out holy shit his death is oh my god i can't even get out i just realized i can't even get out

5040
06:21:10,950 --> 06:21:21,710
oh my uh i forgot about that And I'm, like, too broke to pay the tram.

5041
06:21:24,790 --> 06:21:26,530
I think that's the worst part.

5042
06:21:28,210 --> 06:21:29,650
I have no money.

5043
06:21:31,390 --> 06:21:31,790
Oh, wait.

5044
06:21:32,090 --> 06:21:33,010
Oh, this is how I get out.

5045
06:21:33,230 --> 06:21:33,610
Oh, my God.

5046
06:21:33,810 --> 06:21:34,450
I'm so...

5047
06:21:34,450 --> 06:21:35,470
Oh, shit.

5048
06:21:38,330 --> 06:21:39,490
All right.

5049
06:21:39,610 --> 06:21:40,610
That was close.

5050
06:21:46,150 --> 06:21:46,830
All right.

5051
06:21:47,430 --> 06:21:48,230
Oh, hey, money.

5052
06:21:49,330 --> 06:21:50,290
Take that.

5053
06:21:50,730 --> 06:21:51,870
Is there anything else here?

5054
06:21:58,710 --> 06:22:00,010
Oh my god, there has...

5055
06:22:00,010 --> 06:22:01,190
I hope there's a lamp.

5056
06:22:02,150 --> 06:22:03,950
I hope I find a lamp.

5057
06:22:07,570 --> 06:22:10,850
I'm just perpetually lost in this dark cavern.

5058
06:22:11,550 --> 06:22:12,830
This cavern of misery.

5059
06:22:17,680 --> 06:22:18,320
Oh my god.

5060
06:22:18,500 --> 06:22:19,860
This is like...

5061
06:22:19,860 --> 06:22:22,240
I swear if Silk Song has like...

5062
06:22:22,240 --> 06:22:23,300
The toxic lakes.

5063
06:22:23,940 --> 06:22:25,980
Then it truly is the dark souls.

5064
06:22:26,060 --> 06:22:27,040
of Metrovania.

5065
06:22:30,000 --> 06:22:31,280
They already got the rats.

5066
06:22:31,820 --> 06:22:36,060
They just need the poison lakes, and then we have it all.

5067
06:22:42,180 --> 06:22:43,340
My chair is here.

5068
06:22:46,080 --> 06:22:46,400
Yeah.

5069
06:22:47,400 --> 06:22:48,880
We go left side.

5070
06:22:49,680 --> 06:22:51,320
We just need the poison swamps.

5071
06:22:51,800 --> 06:22:54,720
Then it truly is in the dark souls of Metrovania.

5072
06:22:56,700 --> 06:22:57,820
They have everything.

5073
06:22:58,700 --> 06:23:00,540
They have almost... Oh.

5074
06:23:00,600 --> 06:23:06,120
My There you go It's like that.

5075
06:23:06,600 --> 06:23:07,960
I used it as a platform.

5076
06:23:09,080 --> 06:23:12,580
I used our rats There you go.

5077
06:23:12,920 --> 06:23:15,460
I had a feeling the rats were there.

5078
06:23:15,940 --> 06:23:18,000
Hello What the what?

5079
06:23:19,640 --> 06:23:20,640
What the fuck?

5080
06:23:23,700 --> 06:23:28,880
Oh my god, and then the rats show up It's all right.

5081
06:23:29,320 --> 06:23:29,600
It's fine.

5082
06:23:29,720 --> 06:23:33,100
He doesn't give me anything in there Anyway, I'll just slowly float down.

5083
06:23:34,080 --> 06:23:35,880
He's like, who's that?

5084
06:23:37,600 --> 06:23:40,340
I legitimately don't think he gives me anything useful anyway.

5085
06:23:41,560 --> 06:23:42,980
He's got scissors.

5086
06:23:49,690 --> 06:23:50,310
That's fine.

5087
06:23:51,270 --> 06:23:53,890
I needed heals for that.

5088
06:24:00,600 --> 06:24:01,540
Okay, nice thread.

5089
06:24:03,280 --> 06:24:04,900
But what do I do with thread?

5090
06:24:07,600 --> 06:24:08,580
That's it?

5091
06:24:12,160 --> 06:24:13,790
All right, I'll go this way then.

5092
06:24:16,140 --> 06:24:17,820
What have I not got over here?

5093
06:24:18,300 --> 06:24:20,120
Oh, they're all scissors, man.

5094
06:24:26,000 --> 06:24:27,080
How the fuck?

5095
06:24:30,200 --> 06:24:32,440
Oh, that's how I kill him.

5096
06:24:33,060 --> 06:24:34,580
It's like, snip, snip, snip, snip!

5097
06:24:42,740 --> 06:24:43,240
Wee.

5098
06:24:44,480 --> 06:24:44,980
Wee.

5099
06:24:45,440 --> 06:24:46,100
Oh, shit!

5100
06:24:46,320 --> 06:24:46,460
Okay.

5101
06:24:47,940 --> 06:24:48,560
I'm just...

5102
06:24:48,580 --> 06:24:52,000
floating in the air until he's done.

5103
06:24:55,540 --> 06:24:56,900
I just...

5104
06:24:56,900 --> 06:24:57,700
Okay.

5105
06:25:01,580 --> 06:25:04,740
Gotta float until he's done playing.

5106
06:25:06,660 --> 06:25:07,520
What does this do?

5107
06:25:08,180 --> 06:25:10,700
What the fuck is the point of this?

5108
06:25:10,820 --> 06:25:11,560
I just...

5109
06:25:11,560 --> 06:25:14,440
Look at my... Oh, I must be able to ground pound this area.

5110
06:25:20,270 --> 06:25:20,690
Okay.

5111
06:25:22,170 --> 06:25:38,890
Park boy got that stupid rat get out of here No, yo, yeah, I can't do anything else but go this way What the fuck what the fuck?

5112
06:25:44,350 --> 06:25:47,030
Okay, I did not expect him to fucking come up top

5113
06:25:54,620 --> 06:25:59,600
I'm just gonna run Pat Yeah, he's not a...

5114
06:25:59,600 --> 06:26:00,380
Yeah, no.

5115
06:26:01,640 --> 06:26:03,160
Look at these fuckers.

5116
06:26:07,370 --> 06:26:08,550
Now I'm gonna get you!

5117
06:26:10,890 --> 06:26:12,150
I don't like them.

5118
06:26:13,950 --> 06:26:15,050
Oh my god, I hate them.

5119
06:26:15,130 --> 06:26:16,110
Yeah, I'm not gonna deal with that.

5120
06:26:21,840 --> 06:26:23,580
I'm not gonna deal with that guy.

5121
06:26:25,360 --> 06:26:27,520
He is not worth it.

5122
06:26:27,720 --> 06:26:31,380
He is absolutely not worth it.

5123
06:26:37,230 --> 06:26:37,810
Oh!

5124
06:26:39,230 --> 06:26:39,810
Oh!

5125
06:26:41,010 --> 06:26:41,350
Oh!

5126
06:26:41,670 --> 06:26:41,810
Oh!

5127
06:26:41,810 --> 06:26:42,310
I can't pogo!

5128
06:26:44,730 --> 06:26:47,690
Just do a shimmy because I can't pogo!

5129
06:26:54,100 --> 06:26:54,680
Okay.

5130
06:26:55,820 --> 06:26:58,000
I assumed this guy was supposed to help me.

5131
06:27:00,020 --> 06:27:07,580
If I, the chapel of the Reaper, since you guys said I could have got assistance with that boss.

5132
06:27:09,720 --> 06:27:10,300
Okay.

5133
06:27:24,920 --> 06:27:25,640
Well...

5134
06:27:25,640 --> 06:27:27,580
But I don't need no help.

5135
06:27:29,680 --> 06:27:30,660
Where am I?

5136
06:27:31,240 --> 06:27:32,520
Oh my god.

5137
06:27:39,860 --> 06:27:41,680
Oh my god, get it.

5138
06:27:41,700 --> 06:27:43,020
Oh my god!

5139
06:27:43,440 --> 06:27:45,340
You are such a freak!

5140
06:27:46,380 --> 06:27:47,780
Holy shit!

5141
06:27:56,150 --> 06:27:57,930
You are such a freak.

5142
06:27:58,050 --> 06:28:02,090
You are actually such a free holy shit

5143
06:28:05,180 --> 06:28:19,420
these guys have these guys are the most annoying these guys are the most annoying

5144
06:28:27,020 --> 06:28:42,060
okay there you go oh jesus

5145
06:28:49,300 --> 06:28:50,280
Trev?

5146
06:28:50,780 --> 06:28:50,940
What?

5147
06:28:54,020 --> 06:28:54,120
How?

5148
06:28:54,540 --> 06:28:55,520
Okay.

5149
06:28:59,180 --> 06:29:01,020
Okay, I got it.

5150
06:29:01,100 --> 06:29:01,820
Oh my god.

5151
06:29:07,910 --> 06:29:08,150
Okay.

5152
06:29:12,500 --> 06:29:13,280
He dodged?

5153
06:29:14,600 --> 06:29:15,540
Alright, nice.

5154
06:29:19,440 --> 06:29:20,380
These enemies.

5155
06:29:22,460 --> 06:29:22,740
Oh!

5156
06:29:23,300 --> 06:29:23,760
No!

5157
06:29:25,510 --> 06:29:26,000
No!

5158
06:29:26,020 --> 06:29:27,080
Two of them!

5159
06:29:37,590 --> 06:29:38,470
Oh my god.

5160
06:29:39,070 --> 06:29:41,290
I need them to line up right now.

5161
06:29:42,370 --> 06:29:42,970
Oh, thank god.

5162
06:29:43,450 --> 06:29:44,090
Oh, thank god.

5163
06:29:44,230 --> 06:29:44,690
I had to...

5164
06:29:44,690 --> 06:29:46,210
I need them to line up for the needle.

5165
06:29:46,310 --> 06:29:47,370
This was the only way.

5166
06:29:47,730 --> 06:29:49,090
It was the only way.

5167
06:29:49,170 --> 06:29:50,170
Literally the needle.

5168
06:29:54,780 --> 06:29:57,040
Healing them normally was just too much.

5169
06:29:58,760 --> 06:30:00,380
I don't even know who this guy is.

5170
06:30:00,520 --> 06:30:02,280
I just stabbed him for the fun of it.

5171
06:30:02,600 --> 06:30:03,040
I...

5172
06:30:06,340 --> 06:30:08,620
I don't know who this guy is.

5173
06:30:08,800 --> 06:30:09,880
I was like, dead corpse.

5174
06:30:10,420 --> 06:30:11,520
Stabby, stabby.

5175
06:30:12,860 --> 06:30:13,820
What crest is this?

5176
06:30:14,600 --> 06:30:17,860
Attack with heavy arching slashes and reap additional silk.

5177
06:30:18,800 --> 06:30:19,620
What the fuck?

5178
06:30:21,420 --> 06:30:23,320
What does this give me?

5179
06:30:35,330 --> 06:30:37,150
How much better is this anyway?

5180
06:30:38,670 --> 06:30:40,130
Is this the attack?

5181
06:30:40,350 --> 06:30:42,490
Oh my god, my compass is gone yet again.

5182
06:30:47,960 --> 06:30:48,500
Wait.

5183
06:30:49,740 --> 06:30:51,110
Oh, I have a...

5184
06:30:54,370 --> 06:30:56,190
Oh, this is different now.

5185
06:30:56,550 --> 06:30:56,890
Look at this.

5186
06:30:57,050 --> 06:30:58,370
This feels like a pogo.

5187
06:30:58,750 --> 06:31:00,250
Now I have a... now I have pogo.

5188
06:31:00,870 --> 06:31:02,310
Wait, I pogo now!

5189
06:31:03,450 --> 06:31:05,050
Yeah, and I have an uppercut.

5190
06:31:05,270 --> 06:31:08,090
I have an uppercut and I have a pogo.

5191
06:31:09,230 --> 06:31:10,450
I'm pretty sure.

5192
06:31:12,270 --> 06:31:14,210
I mean, this looks like a pogo.

5193
06:31:18,620 --> 06:31:20,460
Yeah, I have a pogo now.

5194
06:31:21,020 --> 06:31:23,000
No, this is 100...

5195
06:31:23,000 --> 06:31:24,560
Yep, I got Pogo.

5196
06:31:29,080 --> 06:31:29,500
Oh.

5197
06:31:30,260 --> 06:31:31,420
It is slower though.

5198
06:31:33,040 --> 06:31:33,660
That's the thing.

5199
06:31:33,740 --> 06:31:34,380
It is slower.

5200
06:31:35,280 --> 06:31:36,460
I will agree.

5201
06:31:40,820 --> 06:31:43,440
It is a little slower, but it is Pogo.

5202
06:31:49,610 --> 06:31:52,530
Uh, Pogo is when you can chop down.

5203
06:31:52,810 --> 06:31:56,550
So, so now it goes straight down versus like, before.

5204
06:31:57,270 --> 06:31:58,510
Okay, so I got this area.

5205
06:31:59,490 --> 06:32:00,230
Okay, there you go.

5206
06:32:01,230 --> 06:32:02,890
I got the shortcut now for this.

5207
06:32:07,030 --> 06:32:08,250
Where is this area?

5208
06:32:14,970 --> 06:32:16,150
What is this area?

5209
06:32:19,860 --> 06:32:20,920
Wait, what?

5210
06:32:25,570 --> 06:32:25,770
What?

5211
06:32:26,210 --> 06:32:26,730
Oh!

5212
06:32:30,520 --> 06:32:30,980
Oh!

5213
06:32:31,480 --> 06:32:34,080
So I can heal and grab silk.

5214
06:32:37,980 --> 06:32:39,800
Hey, that's interesting.

5215
06:32:43,340 --> 06:32:43,720
Okay.

5216
06:32:44,280 --> 06:32:47,340
I can heal and grab silk at the same time.

5217
06:32:48,180 --> 06:32:50,000
I don't know where this area was.

5218
06:32:52,620 --> 06:32:53,800
What is this area?

5219
06:32:54,580 --> 06:32:55,620
I don't have my compass.

5220
06:32:55,820 --> 06:32:56,800
Oh, oh, I did this.

5221
06:32:56,880 --> 06:32:57,380
Okay, I remember.

5222
06:32:59,420 --> 06:32:59,760
Yeah.

5223
06:33:00,300 --> 06:33:01,080
That's an upgrade.

5224
06:33:01,140 --> 06:33:02,080
Wait, I like this crest.

5225
06:33:02,460 --> 06:33:03,380
This is a good crest.

5226
06:33:04,240 --> 06:33:07,300
I can pogo and I can like...

5227
06:33:08,060 --> 06:33:08,540
Uh...

5228
06:33:09,960 --> 06:33:12,460
And I can grab spells and get more.

5229
06:33:14,280 --> 06:33:14,520
found.

5230
06:33:14,860 --> 06:33:14,860
Yeah.

5231
06:33:15,420 --> 06:33:15,640
Spells it.

5232
06:33:18,000 --> 06:33:22,860
Okay, so that was pointless doing... I get to have a cooler crest.

5233
06:33:23,860 --> 06:33:24,600
And I have uppercut.

5234
06:33:26,360 --> 06:33:28,220
I have uppercut now.

5235
06:33:29,640 --> 06:33:29,860
Okay.

5236
06:33:30,060 --> 06:33:30,560
Uppercut!

5237
06:33:34,680 --> 06:33:35,240
Uppercut!

5238
06:33:35,420 --> 06:33:37,280
Oh, I have enough money for fast track.

5239
06:33:39,960 --> 06:33:40,660
Fast travel.

5240
06:33:52,340 --> 06:33:55,360
Wait, I feel like I can finally buy Wait, how much money do I have?

5241
06:33:56,960 --> 06:33:57,420
I can buy...

5242
06:33:57,420 --> 06:33:58,480
Wait a minute, I can buy...

5243
06:33:59,280 --> 06:34:01,600
I think I can buy the...

5244
06:34:01,600 --> 06:34:02,500
Actually, I don't think so.

5245
06:34:02,680 --> 06:34:03,300
I don't have enough money.

5246
06:34:03,840 --> 06:34:05,480
I finally bought the last tool.

5247
06:34:07,320 --> 06:34:08,920
Because I was never able to afford it.

5248
06:34:09,760 --> 06:34:11,920
But if I buy it from Bone Mera...

5249
06:34:12,760 --> 06:34:14,280
No, I still need to spend $50.

5250
06:34:20,690 --> 06:34:21,630
Well, it's not a spell.

5251
06:34:21,770 --> 06:34:22,910
I get to spam my needle.

5252
06:34:24,030 --> 06:34:25,450
My needle is my spell.

5253
06:34:26,650 --> 06:34:27,050
Beckel.

5254
06:34:28,550 --> 06:34:31,450
Uh, I need to buy this.

5255
06:34:33,770 --> 06:34:35,470
And I still need more money.

5256
06:34:36,430 --> 06:34:37,590
Does anyone have any wishes?

5257
06:34:42,760 --> 06:34:43,160
Sure.

5258
06:34:44,560 --> 06:34:45,140
Here you go.

5259
06:34:45,740 --> 06:34:47,200
I have so many shards.

5260
06:34:48,640 --> 06:34:49,780
I grant you a wish.

5261
06:34:49,920 --> 06:34:51,460
Make a wish, child.

5262
06:34:52,180 --> 06:34:53,020
Look at that.

5263
06:34:55,620 --> 06:35:00,200
The gems that grow up provide pure harvest of treasures and be rewarded.

5264
06:35:00,880 --> 06:35:02,580
Where the fuck are flint beaters?

5265
06:35:04,740 --> 06:35:06,600
I got a wish promise.

5266
06:35:09,540 --> 06:35:10,500
Alright, let's...

5267
06:35:10,500 --> 06:35:12,320
Let's put some crests in there, I think.

5268
06:35:14,700 --> 06:35:15,180
Uh...

5269
06:35:15,180 --> 06:35:18,320
Is there a maximum amount of wishes I have to do?

5270
06:35:19,000 --> 06:35:20,780
I still haven't picked up their berries yet.

5271
06:35:24,700 --> 06:35:25,180
Okay.

5272
06:35:25,700 --> 06:35:26,400
Oh, nice.

5273
06:35:26,500 --> 06:35:27,600
Okay, we need compass.

5274
06:35:30,640 --> 06:35:31,120
Uh...

5275
06:35:31,120 --> 06:35:32,380
I can put this and this.

5276
06:35:33,320 --> 06:35:34,820
And then that's it.

5277
06:35:36,120 --> 06:35:36,560
That's fine.

5278
06:35:36,720 --> 06:35:38,170
I'll get Compass for now.

5279
06:35:41,000 --> 06:35:45,920
And then we have to go.

5280
06:35:52,040 --> 06:35:52,640
Wake up.

5281
06:35:53,700 --> 06:35:54,560
Wake up.

5282
06:35:54,860 --> 06:35:55,980
Sleep time's over.

5283
06:35:58,280 --> 06:35:58,900
Bellheart.

5284
06:35:59,220 --> 06:36:00,380
I guess we have to.

5285
06:36:04,040 --> 06:36:05,920
I guess we have to cross the river.

5286
06:36:06,900 --> 06:36:07,560
I

5287
06:36:12,100 --> 06:36:13,900
I assume it's a river.

5288
06:36:14,060 --> 06:36:15,060
I don't know where else to go.

5289
06:36:15,440 --> 06:36:18,120
Like, I saw them do this little puppeteer.

5290
06:36:19,980 --> 06:36:22,060
I don't have a map for here, too.

5291
06:36:27,400 --> 06:36:29,000
Oh, I'm just gonna go to Sherwood.

5292
06:36:29,920 --> 06:36:30,500
Ah!

5293
06:36:31,120 --> 06:36:31,700
Ah!

5294
06:36:33,060 --> 06:36:35,140
I hate this area.

5295
06:36:36,280 --> 06:36:40,800
Every new area I go to, I'm like, I hate it here.

5296
06:36:43,140 --> 06:36:45,040
I feel like...

5297
06:36:46,120 --> 06:36:48,920
Joey, is there any area you would like?

5298
06:36:49,480 --> 06:36:51,440
That's a good question.

5299
06:36:53,620 --> 06:36:53,620
It

5300
06:36:56,710 --> 06:37:00,030
is a slower Pogo, so I have to like...

5301
06:37:06,010 --> 06:37:06,570
Yeah.

5302
06:37:08,190 --> 06:37:09,810
Oh, get over it.

5303
06:37:10,150 --> 06:37:10,450
Here.

5304
06:37:10,930 --> 06:37:11,150
Okay.

5305
06:37:13,750 --> 06:37:14,470
There you go.

5306
06:37:14,770 --> 06:37:15,770
What the fuck?

5307
06:37:16,070 --> 06:37:16,410
There you go.

5308
06:37:18,950 --> 06:37:20,550
Where's the... Oh, he killed him.

5309
06:37:21,150 --> 06:37:23,250
I was gonna say, what happened to the other Another bug.

5310
06:37:25,230 --> 06:37:26,730
Nice, I got the shards.

5311
06:37:35,690 --> 06:37:38,840
Every new area I find something new to hate.

5312
06:37:40,220 --> 06:37:42,140
It's actually very impressive.

5313
06:37:44,700 --> 06:37:45,340
What's that?

5314
06:37:45,860 --> 06:37:46,360
Ew.

5315
06:37:50,260 --> 06:37:51,000
Ew.

5316
06:37:56,280 --> 06:37:57,340
What the fuck?

5317
06:37:58,480 --> 06:38:01,160
Oh, it's like a, it's like a jelly.

5318
06:38:01,900 --> 06:38:03,300
Or like a slime.

5319
06:38:04,520 --> 06:38:07,340
After I like kill it, it like reproduced and made more.

5320
06:38:09,660 --> 06:38:10,860
Okay, cheer up top.

5321
06:38:11,360 --> 06:38:14,120
I can't do dashes yet.

5322
06:38:14,240 --> 06:38:15,440
This looks like a boss fight.

5323
06:38:15,680 --> 06:38:16,380
I don't...

5324
06:38:16,380 --> 06:38:18,480
Oh my god.

5325
06:38:19,300 --> 06:38:19,760
Oh.

5326
06:38:24,960 --> 06:38:27,380
Okay, it's just a normal trap shit.

5327
06:38:28,760 --> 06:38:29,460
You know what?

5328
06:38:30,240 --> 06:38:31,340
Oh, never mind.

5329
06:38:33,640 --> 06:38:35,120
There we go.

5330
06:38:36,680 --> 06:38:36,860
Oh, me.

5331
06:38:36,960 --> 06:38:37,540
Oh, my God.

5332
06:38:37,820 --> 06:38:38,640
I got stick bug.

5333
06:38:39,020 --> 06:38:39,440
Stick bug.

5334
06:38:46,370 --> 06:38:46,930
Please.

5335
06:38:48,250 --> 06:38:48,530
Please.

5336
06:38:50,550 --> 06:38:53,210
Dad, I'm getting stick bugged right now.

5337
06:38:53,630 --> 06:38:53,990
Stop.

5338
06:39:03,160 --> 06:39:04,400
Okay, give me a sec.

5339
06:39:04,860 --> 06:39:05,580
Give me a sec.

5340
06:39:05,800 --> 06:39:07,220
He's barking at something outside.

5341
06:39:08,380 --> 06:39:08,700
Okay.

5342
06:39:11,680 --> 06:39:13,100
Oh, no, he's barking at me.

5343
06:39:18,080 --> 06:39:20,360
Oh, I forgot to give you a warning tree.

5344
06:39:37,520 --> 06:39:39,740
It's because I didn't give him his warning tree.

5345
06:39:40,680 --> 06:39:44,140
It was like, it says greenies.

5346
06:39:44,300 --> 06:39:46,580
I didn't give him his goddamn greenies.

5347
06:39:47,400 --> 06:39:48,520
Oh, my God, I'm so far.

5348
06:39:50,780 --> 06:39:53,080
I don't even know how to get there.

5349
06:39:55,740 --> 06:39:57,080
I got doubles.

5350
06:39:57,280 --> 06:39:58,100
sick stick bug.

5351
06:39:58,240 --> 06:39:59,240
He's poor this evening.

5352
06:39:59,360 --> 06:39:59,860
Robin, thank you.

5353
06:40:00,480 --> 06:40:01,180
Thank you.

5354
06:40:01,180 --> 06:40:01,460
Thank you.

5355
06:40:02,500 --> 06:40:03,600
Alright, fell hard.

5356
06:40:05,180 --> 06:40:08,440
I didn't give him his little his greenies.

5357
06:40:09,160 --> 06:40:14,380
And usually he gets it every morning and I didn't give it to him this morning because I was playing Silk Song.

5358
06:40:16,220 --> 06:40:17,340
It's been really fun.

5359
06:40:17,400 --> 06:40:20,380
I kept on streaming for six hours already or almost seven hours.

5360
06:40:21,060 --> 06:40:22,600
I've been having really fun so far.

5361
06:40:22,940 --> 06:40:26,360
And the moment I stopped playing, everybody's gonna beat this game in like two more days.

5362
06:40:28,020 --> 06:40:29,160
I wish I could...

5363
06:40:29,160 --> 06:40:29,620
Oh, shit.

5364
06:40:30,100 --> 06:40:36,120
I wish I could keep playing this week, but there's so many stuff to do this week.

5365
06:40:36,360 --> 06:40:39,200
Like, I want to finish a lot of my other obligations, too.

5366
06:40:41,840 --> 06:40:42,800
So sadly...

5367
06:40:42,800 --> 06:40:46,580
So sadly, we don't get another silk song until...

5368
06:40:46,580 --> 06:40:53,500
Until maybe, like, until next week, basically.

5369

Thank God.

5385
06:42:51,690 --> 06:42:54,090
What would I've done without that money?

5386
06:42:58,660 --> 06:42:59,760
It's like this way.

5387
06:43:00,720 --> 06:43:02,260
It wasn't even gear.

5388
06:43:03,680 --> 06:43:09,600
For $100 to $30, I am so lucky.

5389
06:43:15,470 --> 06:43:21,250
I am truly so lucky and so thankful.

5411
06:45:24,520 --> 06:45:25,940
Why was I so greedy?

5412
06:45:29,300 --> 06:45:30,020
Oh!

5413
06:45:32,220 --> 06:45:33,580

5414
06:45:34,880 --> 06:46:04,240
when you hear had a quarrel of vain of old bells the bugs there were snared silent on the web of silk it seems a pernicious trap of some unseen predator i left quickly making sure to avoid the glimmering threads i pass the town myself the thread sickness i've seen in like upon the roads but there does not discriminate the curse that strikes my town the town is driven focus A cold use of silk at a concerning scale.

5415
06:46:06,580 --> 06:46:10,600
If the path permits, I will investigate this source.

5416
06:46:11,100 --> 06:46:12,180
Okay, I...

Alright, good.

We gotta find out more religious bugs.

5447
06:48:30,400 --> 06:48:31,000
What is that?

5448
06:48:31,080 --> 06:48:31,320

06:49:20,480 --> 06:49:22,240
I'm glad I have Pogo.

5454
06:49:25,970 --> 06:49:27,110
What the?

5455
06:49:32,040 --> 06:49:32,800
Okay.

5456
06:49:39,170 --> 06:49:39,450
Alright.

5457
06:49:41,730 --> 06:49:43,570
Come on, I've got you, buddy.

5458
06:49:46,670 --> 06:49:48,430
I've got you!

5459
06:49:51,670 --> 06:49:53,750
That's the child's first word.

5460
06:49:55,610 --> 06:49:57,990
My pogo buff.

5461
06:49:59,250 --> 06:50:00,910
Thank God.

5462
06:50:05,960 --> 06:50:07,140
Holy shit.

5463
06:50:08,000 --> 06:50:09,860
That is so much easier.

5464
06:50:14,500 --> 06:50:16,920
Okay, I jinxed myself.

5465
06:50:19,120 --> 06:50:21,220
I actually jinxed myself there.

5466
06:50:24,000 --> 06:50:25,600
But that is...

5467
06:50:25,620 --> 06:50:27,600
It's so much easier.

5468
06:50:28,240 --> 06:50:30,080
Oh my god.

5469
06:50:35,280 --> 06:50:36,320
Not nice.

5470
06:50:40,280 --> 06:50:42,880
Okay, I need you guys to get closer to me.

5471
06:50:47,020 --> 06:50:47,860
Oh, that's fine.

5472
06:50:48,000 --> 06:50:49,080
I can...

5473
06:50:49,080 --> 06:50:50,060
At least I have friends.

5474
06:50:52,860 --> 06:50:53,700
Oh, what?

5475
06:51:05,020 --> 06:51:05,680
Yeah.

5476
06:51:09,300 --> 06:51:10,140
There we go.

5477
06:51:10,300 --> 06:51:11,420
Yeah, I was not.

5478
06:51:11,500 --> 06:51:13,700
I did not hear about these guys.

5479
06:51:14,220 --> 06:51:14,640
There we go.

5480
06:51:15,240 --> 06:51:15,600
Easy.

5481
06:51:18,960 --> 06:51:20,720
I was like, no, fuck that.

5482
06:51:24,940 --> 06:51:26,760
No, this is a boss fight.

5483
06:51:30,500 --> 06:51:32,320
It's too empty.

5484
06:51:34,440 --> 06:51:37,060
I refuse to go there.

5485
06:51:38,960 --> 06:51:40,280
If it's too empty, I...

5486
06:51:40,300 --> 06:52:02,580
I know no no no no no no no no no no I need $60 I just need $60 I'll climb all of this up the moment I find a bench the

5487
06:52:09,420 --> 06:52:22,690
music stops okay oh my god holy shit Okay, this guy hates bugs.

5488
06:52:24,070 --> 06:52:27,430
This guy really fucking hates outside it.

5489
06:52:27,650 --> 06:52:27,910
Oh

5490
06:52:31,680 --> 06:52:34,240
my god.

5491
06:52:36,220 --> 06:52:36,580
Okay.

5492
06:52:38,720 --> 06:52:40,320
So this is where like, use the uppercut.

5493
06:52:40,940 --> 06:52:43,060
It's really hard to use the uppercut.

5494
06:52:43,940 --> 06:52:45,100
Because, um...

5495
06:52:46,420 --> 06:52:47,920
I have to use the...

5496
06:52:47,920 --> 06:52:49,420
I have to run sprint for it.

5497
06:52:56,440 --> 06:52:57,400
What the...

5498
06:52:59,820 --> 06:53:07,920
okay we're so close friend wait

5499
06:53:13,030 --> 06:53:39,220
there's another bench here it's more money it's more expensive oh my god okay let's go back we got the chair we got the chair That's all we needed.

5500
06:53:50,310 --> 06:53:56,390
The fact that the bench was more expensive, it makes me so sad.

5501
06:53:57,550 --> 06:54:01,950
We have the other bench now.

5502
06:54:02,630 --> 06:54:05,710
Now I don't have to worry about the potential boss fights.

5503
06:54:12,700 --> 06:54:14,640
Okay, this is a bench.

5504
06:54:15,820 --> 06:54:17,340
I recognize the bench.

5505
06:54:19,180 --> 06:54:41,900
It's gong gong Gong gong Yay Oh thank god Thank fucking god Alright now Now we can Now we're fine Yes we can't We don't have a map but that's okay Let me out Let me out, let me out Okay

Okay Oh shit Oh shit The projectile of this...

5507
06:54:53,950 --> 06:54:56,110
Like, it's so inconsistent.

5508
06:54:57,170 --> 06:54:58,250
Holy fuck.

5509
06:55:01,590 --> 06:55:05,410
The projectile for that javelin is so inconsistent.

5510
06:55:07,650 --> 06:55:08,690
Whoops.

5511
06:55:10,370 --> 06:55:11,730
Alright, now...

5512
06:55:12,850 --> 06:55:15,130
Now we can do this parkour again.

5513
06:55:18,620 --> 06:55:19,660
Okay.

5514
06:55:20,440 --> 06:55:21,800
Get out of here.

5515
06:55:25,840 --> 06:55:27,520
God, these guys are so annoying.

5516
06:55:30,640 --> 06:55:32,120
Holy shit, makes me so happy.

5517
06:55:37,680 --> 06:55:38,080
Oops.

5518
06:55:41,160 --> 06:55:44,680
It makes me so happy, I don't have to deal with the weird dash shit.

5519
06:55:45,460 --> 06:55:46,820
You know the weird dash thing?

5520
06:55:50,880 --> 06:55:52,460
Oh, it wasn't a boss fight.

5521
06:55:52,560 --> 06:55:54,740
You know what, I just didn't want to take my chances, okay?

5522
06:55:55,120 --> 06:55:57,640
It was an open area.

5523
06:55:57,780 --> 06:55:58,840
It could have been.

5524
06:55:59,500 --> 06:56:01,200
You don't understand.

5525
06:56:01,920 --> 06:56:03,520
The arrow was so open.

5526
06:56:04,880 --> 06:56:06,460
I wasn't risking it.

5527
06:56:09,040 --> 06:56:09,740
Wait, what?

5528
06:56:11,280 --> 06:56:15,790
What are these purple flowers?

5529
06:56:16,910 --> 06:56:18,590
Wait, what are these purple flowers?

5530
06:56:22,770 --> 06:56:24,370
What is that?

5531
06:56:29,230 --> 06:56:30,210
Holy fuck.

5532
06:56:32,030 --> 06:56:32,730
Ah!

5533
06:56:33,090 --> 06:56:34,810
I can't do this jump anymore.

5534
06:56:39,660 --> 06:56:41,660
The paw lip heart.

5535
06:56:42,200 --> 06:56:43,360
What the fuck is that?

5536
06:56:44,820 --> 06:56:44,920
Oh.

5537
06:56:45,900 --> 06:56:47,640
That damn stupid stick, but...

5538
06:56:49,640 --> 06:56:50,320
That's right.

5539
06:56:50,980 --> 06:56:54,340
I know you can't get over that ledge.

5540
06:56:55,580 --> 06:56:56,540
Is that a charm?

5541
06:56:57,000 --> 06:56:57,220
Oh.

5542
06:56:57,480 --> 06:56:58,460
What the?

5543
06:56:59,560 --> 06:57:00,900
I don't like that.

5544
06:57:03,240 --> 06:57:04,780
That's a face.

5545
06:57:09,660 --> 06:57:10,520
What the?

5546
06:57:10,540 --> 06:57:20,710

5547
06:57:29,660 --> 06:57:37,620

5551
06:58:00,120 --> 06:58:00,940
Two damage!

5552
06:58:18,520 --> 06:58:20,120
Oh, what?

5553
06:58:23,340 --> 06:58:25,040
What are these guys?

5554
06:58:30,210 --> 06:58:31,330
Oh my god.

5555
06:58:33,150 --> 06:58:34,350
Oh my god!

5556
06:58:34,730 --> 06:58:35,450
Oh my god!

5557
06:58:35,970 --> 06:58:36,150
Oh my god!

5558
06:58:36,150 --> 06:58:37,010
I'm so scared!

5559
06:58:37,930 --> 06:58:39,610
I'm so scared!

5560
06:58:45,290 --> 06:58:48,570
I'm getting every fucking optional boss possible!

5561
06:58:52,210 --> 06:58:52,450
Okay.

5562
06:58:58,460 --> 06:59:00,520
I'm actually, I'm, I'm killed.

5563
06:59:02,000 --> 06:59:04,680
I'm, I'm just, oh.

5564
06:59:07,060 --> 06:59:08,000
He's, she's not?

5565
06:59:08,320 --> 06:59:09,420
Oh, thank God.

5566
06:59:09,760 --> 06:59:09,940
Okay.

5567
06:59:10,180 --> 06:59:12,000
As long as she's not optional, I'm happy.

5568
06:59:17,500 --> 06:59:19,600
Wait, how did I, oh, I don't have a map.

5569
06:59:19,660 --> 06:59:20,280
Oh, it's here.

5570
06:59:24,520 --> 06:59:25,380
Oh, that's good.

5571
06:59:26,100 --> 06:59:29,220
I like how every boss I fight, I'm just like, optional.

5572
06:59:34,460 --> 06:59:38,860
If I can't first try her, you're an optional boss.

5573
06:59:54,480 --> 06:59:56,480
Okay, now I know that...

5574
07:00:00,540 --> 07:00:00,960
Okay.

5575
07:00:03,040 --> 07:00:03,880
That's bullshit.

5576
07:00:10,280 --> 07:00:10,700
What?

5577
07:00:11,000 --> 07:00:12,200
Oh, I can cut the...

5578
07:00:12,200 --> 07:00:13,260
I can cut the binds.

5579
07:00:13,380 --> 07:00:14,280
I can cut the binds.

5580
07:00:14,440 --> 07:00:14,640
Okay.

5581
07:00:16,360 --> 07:00:16,780
Yeah.

5582
07:00:17,360 --> 07:00:18,160
Alright, now I know.

5583
07:00:18,400 --> 07:00:19,400
Now I know I can cut the binds.

5584
07:00:19,420 --> 07:00:22,820
I don't know her hitbox is like big.

5585
07:00:23,520 --> 07:00:24,720
You guys notice that?

5586
07:00:25,700 --> 07:00:30,500
Because like at some points I was like there's no way that that can hit me.

5587
07:00:30,960 --> 07:00:33,160
But she has such a big hitbox.

5588
07:00:33,300 --> 07:00:34,360
It's like really hard to tell.

5589
07:00:43,160 --> 07:00:43,420
Okay.

5590
07:00:49,310 --> 07:00:51,410
Oh yeah I need to use vampir.

5591
07:00:51,650 --> 07:00:52,250
No.

5592
07:00:52,770 --> 07:00:53,090
No.

5593
07:00:53,670 --> 07:00:58,390
I think I think magic build is fine.

5594
07:01:02,930 --> 07:01:03,570
Ah.

5595
07:01:04,950 --> 07:01:06,430
I didn't mean not greedy.

5596
07:01:11,580 --> 07:01:11,740
How?

5597
07:01:12,080 --> 07:01:12,300
Okay.

5598
07:01:15,540 --> 07:01:16,180
Alright.

5599
07:01:26,140 --> 07:01:26,560
Alright.

5600
07:01:31,780 --> 07:01:32,560
Oh, thank god.

5601
07:01:33,720 --> 07:01:34,860
I'm fine with that.

5602
07:01:37,380 --> 07:01:38,620
I'm fine with that.

5603
07:01:38,880 --> 07:01:39,480
That's cool.

5604
07:01:39,760 --> 07:01:41,100
Kill your child, I guess.

5605
07:01:46,630 --> 07:01:47,270
Oh.

5606
07:01:52,840 --> 07:01:53,480
Okay.

5607
07:01:53,500 --> 07:01:54,580
There you go.

5608
07:01:59,540 --> 07:02:00,420
Oh, this...

5609
07:02:00,420 --> 07:02:03,080
Okay, this build is actually crazy.

5610
07:02:03,760 --> 07:02:04,540
I like

5611
07:02:08,790 --> 07:02:11,310
this build.

5612
07:02:17,080 --> 07:02:18,380
Holy shit.

5613
07:02:21,310 --> 07:02:22,930
Are you serious?

5614
07:02:29,260 --> 07:02:29,780
Nice.

5615
07:02:32,940 --> 07:02:35,120
Oh my god, thank god.

5616
07:02:37,340 --> 07:02:39,220
Okay, that's good

5617
07:02:46,830 --> 07:02:52,490
There we go All right

5618
07:02:56,330 --> 07:02:58,850
Yeah, that's what I'm saying her hitbox is fucking huge.

5619
07:02:58,930 --> 07:03:00,510
I have to be aware of the hitbox

5620
07:03:04,150 --> 07:03:06,530
Nice that's fucking right

5621
07:03:14,210 --> 07:03:16,630
This is I love this part

5622
07:03:20,650 --> 07:03:22,030
Oh, okay.

5623
07:03:22,370 --> 07:03:24,710
I just had to figure out his pattern.

5624
07:03:28,530 --> 07:03:29,610
Where does it lead?

5625
07:03:30,150 --> 07:03:31,550
I hate these guys, though.

5626
07:03:31,830 --> 07:03:33,610
These guys are fucking freaky.

5627
07:03:36,530 --> 07:03:38,410
Doki, you just hate all of them.

5628
07:03:38,970 --> 07:03:39,450
Exactly!

5629
07:03:41,290 --> 07:03:42,850
Oh, I fucked up the parkour part.

5630
07:03:42,990 --> 07:03:43,730
I gotta do it again.

5631
07:03:45,170 --> 07:03:45,650
Oopsie.

5632
07:03:46,710 --> 07:03:48,170
I gotta parkour this again.

5633
07:03:48,450 --> 07:03:49,110
I messed up.

5634
07:03:51,510 --> 07:03:52,490
They're creepy!

5635
07:03:53,010 --> 07:03:53,510
Exactly!

5636
07:03:53,690 --> 07:03:55,010
They're so creepy!

5637
07:03:56,470 --> 07:03:57,750
Look at them!

5638
07:03:59,170 --> 07:04:00,790
They're ugly as fuck.

5639
07:04:03,490 --> 07:04:06,250
It's just- I don't like that they're like plant faces.

5640
07:04:06,930 --> 07:04:13,670
Or like bug- they're like- they have the faces of- they have a face of a child and that's what It's like, ooh.

5641
07:04:19,020 --> 07:04:21,040
Okay, now that I...

5642
07:04:21,040 --> 07:04:22,680
Okay, honor swaps on parkour.

5643
07:04:23,460 --> 07:04:26,280
With this float, it makes parkour like baby mode.

5644
07:04:27,160 --> 07:04:30,960
This float plus the crest I have now, the...

5645
07:04:30,960 --> 07:04:33,480
Also, that crest is so broken.

5646
07:04:34,080 --> 07:04:35,360
Holy fuck.

5647
07:04:36,440 --> 07:04:39,480
That is a broken crest.

5648
07:04:44,700 --> 07:04:45,580
Yeah, no.

5649
07:04:45,660 --> 07:04:47,400
This is actually baby mode.

5650
07:04:48,880 --> 07:04:49,840
With it.

5651
07:04:53,570 --> 07:04:54,330
Okay, nice.

5652
07:04:56,770 --> 07:04:58,170
Oh, you're not real.

5653
07:05:04,540 --> 07:05:07,700
Like, I literally don't have to worry about parkour when I do this.

5654
07:05:08,320 --> 07:05:09,680
I think that's, like, the best part.

5655
07:05:14,700 --> 07:05:16,240
Because all I have to do is just float.

5656
07:05:17,880 --> 07:05:22,320
So I never have to worry about actually parkouring.

5657
07:05:27,580 --> 07:05:28,440
I want to...

5658
07:05:29,740 --> 07:05:31,200
I just want to get rid of him.

5659
07:05:35,420 --> 07:05:37,500
No, the beast has been very useful.

5660
07:05:41,140 --> 07:05:41,700
Um...

5661
07:05:41,700 --> 07:05:44,100
It's useful in, uh...

5662
07:05:44,100 --> 07:05:48,500
In that boss fight we had, but like after that, um...

5663
07:05:51,860 --> 07:05:52,420
Hmm...

5664
07:05:52,940 --> 07:05:54,380
Okay, that's pretty charged.

5665
07:05:59,410 --> 07:05:59,770
What?

5666
07:05:59,950 --> 07:06:01,290
Oh my god, I don't know what to do.

5667
07:06:02,890 --> 07:06:03,970
How the fuck?

5668
07:06:07,490 --> 07:06:09,210
Okay, I can't...

5669
07:06:10,490 --> 07:06:12,630
Okay, I need to farm him.

5670
07:06:14,030 --> 07:06:14,990
Okay, nice.

5671
07:06:19,510 --> 07:06:19,890
Okay, nice.

5672
07:06:21,010 --> 07:06:21,950
I got my HP back.

5673
07:06:27,690 --> 07:06:28,450
Okay, that's fine.

5674
07:06:28,590 --> 07:06:29,330
Oh my god!

5675
07:06:29,430 --> 07:06:30,810
Okay, that's not fine.

5676
07:06:40,700 --> 07:06:41,860
Oh my god.

5677
07:06:42,200 --> 07:06:43,280
I fucked it up.

5678
07:06:43,420 --> 07:06:45,180
But that's okay, I got my HP back again.

5679
07:06:49,280 --> 07:06:51,240
Like, baby mode.

5680
07:06:52,500 --> 07:06:54,620
Baby mode parkour.

5681
07:06:56,800 --> 07:06:58,460
Oh my god.

5682
07:06:58,980 --> 07:06:59,660
Another upgrade.

5683
07:07:03,920 --> 07:07:05,300
Daughter of a distant land.

5684
07:07:05,880 --> 07:07:07,700
We who remain here waited long.

5685
07:07:08,400 --> 07:07:09,660
Find our strength to yours.

5686
07:07:10,120 --> 07:07:12,440
Reclaim the future of our haunted kingdom.

5687
07:07:13,740 --> 07:07:17,880
Yeah, I think if you hate parkour section, get the Reaper crest.

5688
07:07:18,060 --> 07:07:19,500
It's so convenient.

5689
07:07:19,940 --> 07:07:21,160
It actually is.

5690
07:07:21,320 --> 07:07:23,000
It's so easy.

5691
07:07:25,820 --> 07:07:26,280
Yay!

5692
07:07:27,560 --> 07:07:27,720
Yay!

5693
07:07:27,720 --> 07:07:29,320
I can walk live!

5694
07:07:32,340 --> 07:07:33,720
Hooking, finally!

5695
07:07:36,900 --> 07:07:40,280
Oh my god, now we're Jane silk sawing now.

5696
07:07:40,880 --> 07:07:41,740
Thank god.

5697
07:07:43,480 --> 07:07:45,240
We're finally Jane silk sawing.

5698
07:07:48,880 --> 07:07:49,960
Oh my god.

5699
07:07:58,310 --> 07:07:58,870
Okay.

5700
07:07:59,530 --> 07:08:00,370
Oh, I see you.

5701
07:08:02,110 --> 07:08:02,630
Stupid bug.

5702
07:08:10,200 --> 07:08:10,720
Okay.

5703
07:08:12,800 --> 07:08:13,600
Where are these?

5704
07:08:16,680 --> 07:08:16,920
Oh.

5705
07:08:19,600 --> 07:08:20,640
Oh, shit.

5706
07:08:20,780 --> 07:08:21,540
I have to kill the nest.

5707
07:08:25,810 --> 07:08:26,950
Oh, my god.

5708
07:08:27,670 --> 07:08:28,650
Oh, my god.

5709
07:08:28,750 --> 07:08:29,850
Oh, my god.

5710
07:08:29,990 --> 07:08:30,630
They're coming for me.

5711
07:08:31,250 --> 07:08:33,210
Oh, oh,

5712
07:08:38,060 --> 07:08:38,100

5715
07:09:10,440 --> 07:09:11,440
That's on them.

5716
07:09:11,940 --> 07:09:12,760
Like, it's stupid.

5717
07:09:16,220 --> 07:09:17,860
Wait, where am I?

5718
07:09:20,910 --> 07:09:22,350
Where is this area?

5719
07:09:22,590 --> 07:09:23,050
Oh, my God.

5720
07:09:23,170 --> 07:09:23,810
It's our babies.

5721
07:09:28,340 --> 07:09:29,280
Okay, I'm here.

5722
07:09:30,840 --> 07:09:31,880
Oh, I'm back here.

5723
07:09:32,620 --> 07:09:33,640
Is there anything else down here?

5724
07:09:37,020 --> 07:09:38,720
I wish I have a map.

5725
07:09:39,380 --> 07:09:41,640
It sure would be very useful by now.

5726
07:09:42,300 --> 07:09:42,780
Okay.

5727
07:09:44,060 --> 07:09:46,800
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out where the map is.

5728
07:09:48,480 --> 07:09:50,720
I'm trying to figure out, like, okay, I don't have money for a map.

5729
07:09:50,880 --> 07:09:51,660
I remember now.

5730
07:09:52,300 --> 07:09:55,040
I just don't have money for that.

5731
07:09:55,600 --> 07:09:56,080
Oh yeah!

5732
07:09:56,300 --> 07:09:57,240

07:09:57,240 --> 07:09:58,100
I remember now.

5734
07:09:58,200 --> 07:09:59,420
We want it to go this way.

5735
07:10:04,130 --> 07:10:04,450
Okay.

5736
07:10:04,870 --> 07:10:05,310
This way.

5737
07:10:08,010 --> 07:10:11,270

Oh my god.

5747

Are you serious?

5748
07:11:10,720 --> 07:11:11,140
There you go.

5749
07:11:14,640 --> 07:11:16,320
I don't have a lot.

5750
07:11:17,960 --> 07:11:19,020
Maybe I can...

5751
07:11:21,080 --> 07:11:21,800
I kill him?

5752
07:11:22,640 --> 07:11:23,020
There you go.

5753
07:11:24,800 --> 07:11:25,100
Nice.

5754
07:11:28,380 --> 07:11:29,580
I need a fireman.

5755
07:11:35,760 --> 07:11:38,180
Can't kill me if I'm in the water!

5756
07:11:42,260 --> 07:11:43,020
No money?

5757
07:11:43,660 --> 07:11:44,680
I need just a bathroom.

5758
07:11:46,040 --> 07:11:47,340
Hang out with the stick bugs.

5759
07:11:47,520 --> 07:11:47,740
JK.

5760
07:11:48,860 --> 07:11:49,420
I'll be right back.

5761
07:11:49,680 --> 07:11:50,300
I used to bathroom.

5762
07:13:35,830 --> 07:13:36,910
Thank you for the super chat.

5763
07:13:37,010 --> 07:13:38,330
Gordon, Matt, and Miriam.

5764
07:13:38,630 --> 07:13:38,930
Thank you.

5765
07:13:39,250 --> 07:13:39,310
Thank you.

5766
07:13:41,210 --> 07:13:42,230
Thank you for the super chat.

5767
07:13:42,370 --> 07:13:42,550
Thank you.

5768
07:13:42,570 --> 07:13:43,210
Thank you.

5769
07:13:43,530 --> 07:13:43,530
Alright.

5770
07:13:43,990 --> 07:13:44,930
We still have no map.

5771
07:13:45,350 --> 07:13:45,350
Okay.

5772
07:13:45,510 --> 07:13:45,950
Don't worry.

5773
07:13:46,470 --> 07:13:47,890
I know what to do.

5774
07:13:48,250 --> 07:13:48,250
Wait.

5775
07:13:48,870 --> 07:13:49,050
Yeah.

5776
07:13:49,970 --> 07:13:50,290
Wait.

5777
07:13:50,670 --> 07:13:51,010
Yeah.

5778
07:13:53,990 --> 07:13:56,650
We got a backtrack.

5779
07:13:57,930 --> 07:14:00,510
Very, very back.

5780
07:14:04,230 --> 07:14:05,610
There you go.

5781
07:14:08,510 --> 07:14:11,350
Okay, how much was the tram?

5782
07:14:18,210 --> 07:14:19,790
Guys, how much was the...

5783
07:14:19,790 --> 07:14:20,290
Wait, actually?

5784
07:14:20,970 --> 07:14:22,190
Guys, how much was the tram?

5785
07:14:26,690 --> 07:14:27,390
80?

5786
07:14:27,770 --> 07:14:29,790
Okay, we don't necessarily have to backtrack.

5787
07:14:31,330 --> 07:14:38,090
We just need to get to the first bench, reset it, and farm this one guy.

5788
07:14:40,870 --> 07:14:42,950
It's the only way.

5789
07:14:46,830 --> 07:14:47,230
Alright.

5790
07:14:54,960 --> 07:14:56,720
We just farm.

5791
07:14:59,360 --> 07:15:00,320
This guy.

5792
07:15:07,160 --> 07:15:08,860
Oh my god, there is one.

5793
07:15:09,580 --> 07:15:10,960
And there's another 11.

5794
07:15:11,200 --> 07:15:12,580
We just gotta do that.

5795
07:15:13,360 --> 07:15:14,700
We gotta do that.

5796
07:15:16,140 --> 07:15:16,760
Three more times.

5797
07:15:16,800 --> 07:15:17,500
It's 80, right?

5798
07:15:17,640 --> 07:15:18,540
It's 80, right?

5799
07:15:21,360 --> 07:15:22,680
I need 80.

5800
07:15:22,900 --> 07:15:23,620
I don't remember.

5801
07:15:23,740 --> 07:15:24,740
How much was the trap?

5802
07:15:25,420 --> 07:15:26,980
He's gonna be our farm.

5803
07:15:31,520 --> 07:15:34,300
He is our one farm to rule them all.

5804
07:15:35,020 --> 07:15:36,540
This is a farming stream now.

5805
07:15:39,800 --> 07:15:40,200
80.

5806
07:15:40,360 --> 07:15:40,600
Okay.

5807
07:15:40,960 --> 07:15:42,260
I just need to do it with that.

5808
07:15:45,800 --> 07:15:46,580
There he is.

5809
07:15:47,340 --> 07:15:48,700
Get around here.

5810
07:15:50,000 --> 07:15:51,200
Your purpose.

5811
07:15:53,540 --> 07:15:55,020

07:16:45,870 --> 07:16:46,330
Oh my!

5818
07:16:47,430 --> 07:16:47,770

07:17:08,850 --> 07:17:10,070
Yeah, a little piggy bank.

5827
07:17:11,190 --> 07:17:11,640

5828
07:17:12,330 --> 07:17:13,410
Wait, where is it?

5829
07:17:13,450 --> 07:17:14,030
Was it here?

5830
07:17:15,450 --> 07:17:16,530
No, it was here.

5831
07:17:16,710 --> 07:17:18,150
The tram was above us, right?

5832
07:17:28,080 --> 07:17:30,280
Yeah, I just didn't want to deal with him.

5833
07:17:30,820 --> 07:17:31,940
I cannot be bothered.

5834
07:17:36,260 --> 07:17:37,460
There you go.

5835
07:17:41,390 --> 07:17:42,310
Oh my god!

5836
07:17:42,990 --> 07:17:43,590

5837
07:17:45,350 --> 07:17:46,490

5838
07:17:54,520 --> 07:17:56,300
I actually got double hit.

5839
07:17:58,860 --> 07:18:00,140
Yeah, get me my silk.

5840
07:18:02,340 --> 07:18:03,780
This better be the goddamn tram.

5841
07:18:05,480 --> 07:18:05,840
Nice.

5842
07:18:08,060 --> 07:18:08,740
I...

5843
07:18:09,460 --> 07:18:11,320
It was 60.

5844
07:18:11,800 --> 07:18:13,960
I didn't even need 80.

5845
07:18:14,600 --> 07:18:15,860
It was 60.

5846
07:18:16,560 --> 07:18:17,240
That's fine.

5847
07:18:17,420 --> 07:18:17,760
That's fine.

5848
07:18:20,080 --> 07:18:20,740
It's extra.

5849
07:18:21,540 --> 07:18:22,100
That's fine.

5850
07:18:22,760 --> 07:18:24,060
We just got a little extra.

5851
07:18:26,800 --> 07:18:28,080
Just in case, you know.

5852
07:18:28,860 --> 07:18:31,520
You always need a little bit extra to top it up.

5853
07:18:33,800 --> 07:18:34,360
Alright.

5854
07:18:35,700 --> 07:18:37,000
We go to Greymore.

5855
07:18:40,050 --> 07:18:42,470
We have to meet our new piggy banks.

5856
07:18:44,910 --> 07:18:45,770
I think it's like here.

5857
07:18:46,330 --> 07:18:46,590
Alright.

5858
07:18:48,190 --> 07:18:48,670
Alright.

5859
07:18:51,030 --> 07:18:53,570
I think our new piggy bank was like here.

5860
07:18:55,250 --> 07:18:57,230
Oh god I hate these guys.

5861
07:18:59,650 --> 07:19:00,210

07:19:05,170 --> 07:19:06,170
Where's our piggy bank?

5864
07:19:10,220 --> 07:19:12,140
All right, there it is.

5868
07:19:32,300 --> 07:19:33,500

Alright, nice.

5872
07:20:19,420 --> 07:20:21,260

Thank God.

5875
07:20:31,750 --> 07:20:33,070
Because we need to buy several.

5876
07:20:33,130 --> 07:20:35,310
We need to buy...

5877
07:20:36,870 --> 07:20:40,530
Oh my god, they're fighting back for now.

5878
07:20:46,310 --> 07:20:47,290
That's cute.

5879
07:20:47,450 --> 07:20:49,250
They try to fight back.

5880
07:20:55,170 --> 07:20:56,110
How cute.

5881
07:21:00,450 --> 07:21:01,690
Alright, here we go.

5882
07:21:04,330 --> 07:21:05,830
How am I the crazy one?

5883
07:21:05,950 --> 07:21:07,330
They're the ones in a cut.

5884
07:21:09,730 --> 07:21:10,970
I'm just...

5885
07:21:10,970 --> 07:21:13,190
I'm just saving them.

5886
07:21:13,690 --> 07:21:13,890
Oh.

5887
07:21:14,370 --> 07:21:15,830
God, what a waste of money.

5888
07:21:19,150 --> 07:21:21,890
It's like they don't want to get robbed.

5889
07:21:22,250 --> 07:21:23,430
They're part of a cult.

5890
07:21:23,590 --> 07:21:24,730
I'm saving them.

5891
07:21:27,250 --> 07:21:29,050
I'm literally saving their lives.

5892
07:21:37,160 --> 07:21:38,120
There we go.

5893
07:21:38,340 --> 07:21:39,720
See, I'm a hero.

5894
07:21:40,960 --> 07:21:41,580
I'm liberating.

5895
07:21:41,640 --> 07:21:44,020
Yeah, I'm liberating their souls right now.

5896
07:21:44,560 --> 07:21:47,120
Then they'll go to my dad's heaven.

5897
07:21:47,400 --> 07:21:47,780
Okay?

5898
07:21:48,000 --> 07:21:49,840
They're believing in a false god.

5899
07:21:49,840 --> 07:21:52,480
There's only one God, and it's my mom and dad.

5900
07:21:54,800 --> 07:21:56,520
It could be a happy club.

5901
07:21:56,760 --> 07:21:57,960
They don't know that they're happy.

5902
07:21:58,200 --> 07:21:59,800
I'm here to teach them to be happy.

5903
07:22:06,980 --> 07:22:07,780
Don't worry.

5904
07:22:07,960 --> 07:22:12,680
I'm here to save their life by liberating their souls.

5905
07:22:14,480 --> 07:22:16,860
Nepo baby on a crusade.

5906
07:22:19,840 --> 07:22:21,840
Oh, I can, like...

5907
07:22:21,840 --> 07:22:22,140
Nice.

5908
07:22:24,500 --> 07:22:26,040
Okay, we need to get to...

5909
07:22:26,040 --> 07:22:27,220
Let's get to...

5910
07:22:27,220 --> 07:22:28,340
Okay, what do we need to buy?

5911
07:22:28,460 --> 07:22:29,580
We need to buy...

5912
07:22:29,580 --> 07:22:31,820
Oh my god, we gotta buy so many things.

5913
07:22:33,680 --> 07:22:34,440
Let's get to...

5914
07:22:34,440 --> 07:22:35,960
Fuck it, let's get to a thousand.

5915
07:22:38,840 --> 07:22:40,920
Their pain will never stop.

5916
07:22:44,260 --> 07:22:45,140
They're literally...

5917
07:22:45,140 --> 07:22:45,680
They're literally...

5918
07:22:45,680 --> 07:22:46,300
Oh, shit.

5919
07:22:47,840 --> 07:22:49,740
No, you ain't getting my money.

5920
07:22:51,540 --> 07:22:53,280

5921
07:23:01,000 --> 07:23:06,360

We're not getting the $500 key, guys.

5925
07:24:07,460 --> 07:24:09,860
We're not getting the $500 key.

5926
07:24:18,110 --> 07:24:21,030
That is a little bit too much farming.

5927
07:24:23,090 --> 07:24:23,190
Jesus.

5928
07:24:23,570 --> 07:24:23,930
Ah!

5929
07:24:26,830 --> 07:24:28,570
They fought back.

5930
07:24:29,310 --> 07:24:29,910
Oh, my...

5931
07:24:29,910 --> 07:24:30,270
It's okay.

5932
07:24:30,330 --> 07:24:31,190
I can get it back.

5933
07:24:32,670 --> 07:24:34,470
I can't believe it.

5934
07:24:37,310 --> 07:24:38,530
I got it back.

5935
07:24:39,410 --> 07:24:40,010
That's right.

5936
07:24:40,930 --> 07:24:42,350
You know, I was gonna stop.

5937
07:24:43,050 --> 07:24:45,470
Now I'm definitely not gonna stop.

5938
07:24:50,210 --> 07:24:52,470
Okay, is 400 enough for everything?

5939
07:24:55,670 --> 07:24:57,650
I think 400 should be enough, right?

5940
07:25:03,990 --> 07:25:06,330
That was supposed to be my last run.

5941
07:25:06,950 --> 07:25:08,290
But now...

5942
07:25:09,730 --> 07:25:10,270
Now...

5943
07:25:10,270 --> 07:25:12,330
Now we keep going.

5944
07:25:17,370 --> 07:25:17,670
Alright.

5945
07:25:26,910 --> 07:25:28,230
Oh, there we go.

5946
07:25:29,350 --> 07:25:31,710
It's always this one that dies last.

5947
07:25:31,830 --> 07:25:33,050
Alright, now that should be enough.

5948
07:25:33,170 --> 07:25:34,410
Okay, we can go back now.

5949
07:25:36,630 --> 07:25:38,050
Guys, we can go back.

5950
07:25:39,830 --> 07:25:40,250
Alright.

5951
07:25:40,950 --> 07:25:42,370
We go this way.

5952
07:25:43,610 --> 07:25:45,030
Go to the tram.

5953
07:25:46,050 --> 07:25:48,110
And then we go by...

5954
07:25:49,630 --> 07:25:50,090
Jesus Christ.

5955
07:25:50,110 --> 07:25:51,710
Chris, I need to try to remember everything I need to buy.

5956
07:25:51,970 --> 07:25:54,490
We buy the last trinket, the last tool.

5957
07:25:58,740 --> 07:25:59,860
And then we have to buy...

5958
07:26:00,780 --> 07:26:01,460
What do we have to buy?

5959
07:26:01,740 --> 07:26:02,780
We buy the last tool.

5960
07:26:04,400 --> 07:26:05,520
I want to make sure I...

5961
07:26:05,520 --> 07:26:07,360
But we have to buy our maps too.

5962
07:26:11,390 --> 07:26:11,790
Okay.

5963
07:26:12,430 --> 07:26:13,810
Does she have anything useful?

5964
07:26:15,550 --> 07:26:16,350
Okay, no.

5965
07:26:19,670 --> 07:26:20,470
Terrible tyrant.

5966
07:26:20,610 --> 07:26:21,230
Oh, it's not me.

5967
07:26:21,350 --> 07:26:21,590
Okay.

5968
07:26:22,190 --> 07:26:22,590
Okay.

5969
07:26:25,630 --> 07:26:28,690
It's not... It's not me, so it's fine.

5970
07:26:29,250 --> 07:26:30,770
It wasn't me.

5971
07:26:31,290 --> 07:26:35,770
I was like, oh my god, how did they know?

5972
07:26:37,850 --> 07:26:38,470
Okay.

5973
07:26:40,390 --> 07:26:41,310
Belhar map.

5974
07:26:44,370 --> 07:26:46,230
The shellwood map that we needed.

5975
07:26:47,970 --> 07:26:50,730
Alright, and then we got to buy the last trinket.

5976
07:26:53,480 --> 07:26:53,790
Okay.

5977
07:26:53,810 --> 07:26:55,150
I was like, oh no, did they know?

5978
07:26:55,930 --> 07:26:57,310
No, they don't know, thank God.

5979
07:26:58,730 --> 07:27:00,590
Thank God they're too stupid to know.

5980
07:27:03,110 --> 07:27:06,950
They don't know that every time a crime was committed, I was last seen there.

5981
07:27:13,610 --> 07:27:15,150
Get the pins, the doors, the...

5982
07:27:15,150 --> 07:27:16,590
Guys, I don't have money for that.

5983
07:27:18,870 --> 07:27:21,570
I have more important things to spend right now.

5984
07:27:24,110 --> 07:27:24,790
Sit down here.

5985
07:27:31,500 --> 07:27:32,760
Okay, I need to put compasses.

5986
07:27:32,780 --> 07:27:35,860
I forgot where I am.

5987
07:27:36,960 --> 07:27:38,540
Oh nice, there you go.

5988
07:27:40,260 --> 07:27:41,960
Oh my god, we finally buy this.

5989
07:27:42,060 --> 07:27:43,060
It's been so long.

5990
07:27:43,540 --> 07:27:44,220
Tool acquired.

5991
07:27:49,600 --> 07:27:51,820
Okay, I don't even know what this tool is.

5992
07:27:59,660 --> 07:28:00,800
What the fuck?

5993
07:28:04,700 --> 07:28:05,360
Oh,

5994
07:28:11,810 --> 07:28:13,450
it's this!

5995
07:28:14,550 --> 07:28:15,090
Oh!

5996
07:28:20,050 --> 07:28:21,010
I said...

5997
07:28:21,010 --> 07:28:23,570
Wait, is there like...

5998
07:28:23,570 --> 07:28:24,990
I can't remember where this is.

5999
07:28:27,130 --> 07:28:28,650
Oh yeah, it's the fucking key.

6000
07:28:28,750 --> 07:28:29,710
I keep forgetting that's the key.

6001
07:28:31,030 --> 07:28:32,850
Okay, so it has charges.

6002
07:28:33,390 --> 07:28:34,150
How do I know...

6003
07:28:37,050 --> 07:28:41,110
Yeah, it's the... Okay, that's... that's pretty strong.

6004
07:28:41,290 --> 07:28:41,490
Wait.

6005
07:28:42,710 --> 07:28:44,250
That would have helped a lot.

6006
07:28:45,750 --> 07:28:46,890
I just realized.

6007
07:28:47,890 --> 07:28:48,830
Wait a minute.

6008
07:28:49,750 --> 07:28:52,450
That would have helped a lot during boss fights.

6009
07:28:53,550 --> 07:28:54,150
Oh, wow.

6010
07:28:55,090 --> 07:28:56,170
Man, I wish I knew that.

6011
07:28:56,590 --> 07:28:57,030
Yeah.

6012
07:28:59,090 --> 07:28:59,890
Oh, man.

6013
07:29:00,190 --> 07:29:02,270
That would have been nice to know a little earlier.

6014
07:29:02,450 --> 07:29:03,190
That's for sure.

6015
07:29:04,310 --> 07:29:05,850
I'm going to go back because I can now...

6016
07:29:08,430 --> 07:29:10,750
Yeah, that would have helped a lot in the beast fight.

6017
07:29:12,970 --> 07:29:13,410
Oops.

6018
07:29:14,910 --> 07:29:17,350
Okay, now that I can wall dash, I can do this.

6019
07:29:17,830 --> 07:29:18,630
Wait, no.

6020
07:29:19,290 --> 07:29:20,990
I thought there was something I need to do, like, what?

6021
07:29:21,490 --> 07:29:21,990
No, whatever.

6022
07:29:23,110 --> 07:29:23,950
Oh, it was back there.

6023
07:29:23,970 --> 07:29:24,870
It was in the motto.

6024
07:29:25,110 --> 07:29:25,930
I don't remember now.

6025
07:29:32,490 --> 07:29:34,710
Okay, I want to...

6026
07:29:37,210 --> 07:29:40,570
I want to do the wall jump one area.

6027
07:29:40,970 --> 07:29:41,470
It was here.

6028
07:29:45,670 --> 07:29:47,030
Because now I can do this now.

6029
07:29:47,650 --> 07:29:49,250
So I'm sure there's something here, right?

6030
07:29:51,070 --> 07:29:52,030
I knew it.

6031
07:29:57,410 --> 07:29:58,250
I knew it was money.

6032
07:30:00,010 --> 07:30:00,890
I need this.

6033
07:30:03,950 --> 07:30:04,210
Alright.

6034
07:30:15,860 --> 07:30:17,380
Oh my god.

6035
07:30:17,540 --> 07:30:18,080
That's fine.

6036
07:30:21,220 --> 07:30:24,680
I think I hate these guys the most out of all of them.

6037
07:30:25,760 --> 07:30:27,960
I definitely hate these guys the most.

6038
07:30:30,620 --> 07:30:31,520
Wait, that's it?

6039
07:30:34,460 --> 07:30:35,380
That's it?

6040
07:30:36,940 --> 07:30:38,120
Oh, I knew it.

6041
07:30:39,060 --> 07:30:40,260
Secret tunnel.

6042
07:30:43,060 --> 07:30:44,320
There we go.

6043
07:30:45,240 --> 07:30:46,020
Where does this go?

6044
07:30:54,730 --> 07:30:55,050
Oh.

6045
07:30:56,250 --> 07:30:56,810
Oh.

6046
07:30:57,310 --> 07:30:58,970
Alright, time for a boss fight.

6047
07:31:00,970 --> 07:31:02,670
Oh, it's this quest.

6048
07:31:02,850 --> 07:31:03,930
It's the make-a-wish.

6049
07:31:09,980 --> 07:31:11,880
Okay, I got really lucky for that.

6050
07:31:15,180 --> 07:31:15,780
Ow.

6051
07:31:24,410 --> 07:31:24,690
All right.

6052
07:31:26,950 --> 07:31:28,670
Okay, I can jump for that.

6053
07:31:29,030 --> 07:31:30,210
That's good to know.

6054
07:31:33,540 --> 07:31:34,140
Oh.

6055
07:31:35,540 --> 07:31:35,980
Fuck.

6056
07:31:42,640 --> 07:31:43,420
I gotta be careful.

6057
07:31:44,800 --> 07:31:46,440
Ah, he's so fast.

6058
07:31:46,920 --> 07:31:47,880
The mines!

6059
07:31:48,040 --> 07:31:48,300
I forgot!

6060
07:31:50,420 --> 07:31:51,820
Okay, where am I?

6061
07:31:54,440 --> 07:31:56,100
We don't have to fight him yet.

6062
07:31:56,280 --> 07:31:57,720
We're so far anyway.

6063
07:31:59,160 --> 07:32:00,780
I'm not used to using him.

6064
07:32:03,060 --> 07:32:04,780
I'm not used to using the mines.

6065
07:32:07,380 --> 07:32:08,840
Okay, let's go to a tram.

6066
07:32:09,860 --> 07:32:11,580

My money!

6069
07:32:22,520 --> 07:32:24,820

What?

6075
07:33:11,240 --> 07:33:13,600
Okay, that was bullshit.

6076
07:33:17,980 --> 07:33:19,280
That was bullshit.

6077
07:33:22,680 --> 07:33:24,260
Wait, you came back?

6078
07:33:25,380 --> 07:33:26,620
Okay, that's fine.

6079
07:33:33,690 --> 07:33:35,570
Was there anything this way?

6080
07:33:35,830 --> 07:33:36,870
Oh, yeah, I got the this.

6081
07:33:45,420 --> 07:33:45,800

07:33:47,520 --> 07:33:49,540
I really...

6084
07:33:49,540 --> 07:33:50,760
I don't like these guys.

6085
07:33:51,760 --> 07:33:52,560
At all.

6086
07:33:59,950 --> 07:34:00,870
Like...

6087
07:34:00,870 --> 07:34:01,210
Ah.

6088
07:34:02,990 --> 07:34:04,990
These guys are so annoying.

6089
07:34:06,170 --> 07:34:09,230
They're annoying more so with the fact that...

6090
07:34:10,010 --> 07:34:11,350
Are you serious?

6091
07:34:11,470 --> 07:34:12,050
No!

6092
07:34:13,650 --> 07:34:13,650
No!

6093
07:34:14,230 --> 07:34:14,950
No!

6094
07:34:19,220 --> 07:34:19,480
No!

6095
07:34:21,000 --> 07:34:21,920
I

6096
07:34:28,000 --> 07:34:29,560
lost the body!

6097
07:34:31,220 --> 07:34:31,860
No!

6098
07:34:39,820 --> 07:34:46,380
I killed those people and all I got was zero dollars.

6099
07:34:48,120 --> 07:34:50,300
I killed so many.

6100
07:34:53,360 --> 07:34:54,760
Back to the mines.

6101
07:34:55,000 --> 07:34:55,560
It's fine.

6102
07:34:55,640 --> 07:34:57,320
At least I bought everything I need.

6103
07:34:58,380 --> 07:34:59,900
I should have played safe.

6104
07:35:00,120 --> 07:35:00,560
I should have.

6105
07:35:00,580 --> 07:35:00,940
of.

6106
07:35:02,600 --> 07:35:16,140
I just, those bugs, ever since the friend shit, ever since the beast, I have a particular hatred for all of those bugs.

6107
07:35:16,720 --> 07:35:19,540
They annoy me so much.

6108
07:35:22,920 --> 07:35:24,220
You're broke.

6109
07:35:25,160 --> 07:35:26,480
No, you don't understand.

6110
07:35:26,840 --> 07:35:31,100
It's just, I don't have enough for the bench now.

6111
07:35:32,000 --> 07:35:32,920
Oh, we don't need it.

6112
07:35:33,160 --> 07:35:33,600
It's fine.

6113
07:35:33,760 --> 07:35:34,620
We don't need it.

6114
07:35:35,080 --> 07:35:37,840
I realized I forgot to...

6115
07:35:37,840 --> 07:35:40,760
Oh, I forgot to buy the bench.

6116
07:35:41,560 --> 07:35:44,040
I forgot to buy the bench.

6117
07:35:45,100 --> 07:35:46,260
I... I...

6118
07:35:49,360 --> 07:35:51,660
Spare a song for those who lay here silent.

6119
07:35:52,180 --> 07:35:55,100
By shrimp abandoned, they fell before the final ascent.

6120
07:35:57,300 --> 07:35:57,900
Who lives here?

6121
07:35:58,160 --> 07:35:58,440

6171
07:40:27,840 --> 07:40:30,020
Oh, please tell me this is the chair.

6172
07:40:31,440 --> 07:40:32,820
What the fuck is...

6173
07:40:32,820 --> 07:40:33,940
Oh, that's the bead.

6174
07:40:34,220 --> 07:40:35,320
That's the bead thing.

6175
07:40:38,120 --> 07:40:39,940
Okay, that just shrugs your beads.

6176
07:40:40,040 --> 07:40:40,780
I remember now.

6177
07:40:42,600 --> 07:40:44,680
Where wealth is...

6178
07:40:44,680 --> 07:40:48,460
In a world where wealth is measured in rosary beads.

6179
07:40:49,380 --> 07:40:49,660
Okay.

6180
07:40:50,940 --> 07:40:53,860
Okay, now I can figure out what the fuck this place was.

6181
07:40:57,640 --> 07:41:00,940
He died for a good cause.

6182
07:41:06,210 --> 07:41:06,610
Oh.

6183
07:41:07,590 --> 07:41:09,110
I gotta...

6184
07:41:11,270 --> 07:41:12,790
I gotta...

6185
07:41:12,790 --> 07:41:15,050
I'm so hungry for...

6186
07:41:15,250 --> 07:41:16,530
for rosary beads.

6187
07:41:21,640 --> 07:41:21,800
Yeah.

6188
07:41:26,800 --> 07:41:27,700
Oh my god.

6189
07:41:27,900 --> 07:41:28,440
Okay, I hope he comes.

6190
07:41:28,500 --> 07:41:29,240
She comes down.

6191
07:41:30,540 --> 07:41:30,820
Okay.

6192
07:41:31,240 --> 07:41:31,580
Nice.

6193
07:41:32,500 --> 07:41:34,420
Because these guys were... Oh, shit.

6194
07:41:39,810 --> 07:41:40,610
Get over here.

6195
07:41:41,230 --> 07:41:42,270
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

6196
07:41:42,870 --> 07:41:43,430
Yum, yum, yum.

6197
07:41:44,890 --> 07:41:45,890
Throw her $5.

6198
07:41:47,870 --> 07:41:49,010
It's worth it.

6199
07:41:55,560 --> 07:41:56,580
Oh, fuck.

6200
07:41:57,240 --> 07:41:57,240
Oops.

6201
07:42:01,070 --> 07:42:02,210
Oh, what the fuck?

6202
07:42:02,370 --> 07:42:03,930
Oh, it's because I...

6203
07:42:03,930 --> 07:42:05,250
I floated it.

6204
07:42:06,610 --> 07:42:07,010
Okay.

6205
07:42:07,830 --> 07:42:08,370
There we go.

6206
07:42:09,230 --> 07:42:10,290
I floated too soon.

6207
07:42:10,970 --> 07:42:11,830
What is here?

6208
07:42:13,790 --> 07:42:15,010
What's this side?

6209
07:42:18,410 --> 07:42:19,570
Oh, shortcut!

6210
07:42:23,300 --> 07:42:24,740
Gone, gone, gone, gone.

6211
07:42:25,660 --> 07:42:27,020
Gone, gone, gone, gone.

6212
07:42:28,570 --> 07:42:28,980
Gone.

6213
07:42:30,460 --> 07:42:30,460
Gone.

6214
07:42:30,740 --> 07:42:30,740
Gone.

6215
07:42:31,300 --> 07:42:31,300
Gone.

6216
07:42:31,680 --> 07:42:32,100
Gone.

6217
07:42:33,340 --> 07:42:33,340
Gone.

6218
07:42:34,820 --> 07:42:35,640
Gone.

6219
07:42:36,240 --> 07:42:36,240
Gone.

6220
07:42:36,600 --> 07:42:36,600
Gone.

6221
07:42:36,740 --> 07:42:37,560
Yay, chair!

6222
07:42:39,060 --> 07:42:39,700
Yippee!

6223
07:42:42,260 --> 07:42:44,620
Oh, this is a travel area.

6224
07:42:44,820 --> 07:42:45,160
Nice!

6225
07:42:45,420 --> 07:42:46,760
Unlocked it.

6226
07:42:50,930 --> 07:42:51,750
Okay.

6227
07:42:52,570 --> 07:42:53,130
Yeah!

6228
07:42:58,860 --> 07:43:00,440
It's just bottom map.

6229
07:43:03,400 --> 07:43:05,380
What is this?

6230
07:43:05,800 --> 07:43:07,340
I just...

6231
07:43:07,340 --> 07:43:08,920
But I just bought a map.

6232
07:43:15,950 --> 07:43:17,330
What is this place?

6233
07:43:21,340 --> 07:43:23,240
Oh, my...

6234
07:43:24,820 --> 07:43:25,300
Oh...

6235
07:43:27,160 --> 07:43:28,120
Where...

6236
07:43:29,360 --> 07:43:31,140
Where am I?

6237
07:43:31,580 --> 07:43:33,020
Where am I falling?

6238
07:43:33,680 --> 07:43:33,880
Oh!

6239
07:43:36,640 --> 07:43:37,600
My...

6240
07:43:37,600 --> 07:43:40,100
What the fuck?

6241
07:43:43,040 --> 07:43:44,360
Where did I...

6242
07:43:45,000 --> 07:43:46,560
Where did I go?

6243
07:43:47,260 --> 07:43:52,250
Oh no.

6244
07:43:52,590 --> 07:43:53,050
Oh no.

6245
07:43:53,130 --> 07:43:53,770
Okay, we're not.

6246
07:43:54,030 --> 07:43:54,710
We're...

6247
07:43:54,710 --> 07:43:56,510
We are...

6248
07:43:59,440 --> 07:44:00,620
How did I...

6249
07:44:01,180 --> 07:44:02,640
How did I...

6250
07:44:03,820 --> 07:44:04,500
What?

6251
07:44:05,140 --> 07:44:07,180
How did I get here?

6252
07:44:13,300 --> 07:44:16,240
Alright, let's just...

6253
07:44:17,040 --> 07:44:19,280
Alright, let's go back.

6254
07:44:21,720 --> 07:44:35,700
I keep thinking to hit the bell Because of Hollow Knight But all I have to do is literally just call him I was so confused I fell so far I just kept falling

6255
07:44:41,840 --> 07:44:53,460
I was like Oh it's bone bottom It's another area Shit Okay Bone Wait I didn't go there What the fuck is over there Is that important?

6256
07:44:53,700 --> 07:44:55,280
No, can't be, right?

6257
07:44:58,750 --> 07:45:01,170
Yeah, that was a fucking big fall.

6258
07:45:01,390 --> 07:45:03,690
I was not expecting how far I was falling.

6259
07:45:08,120 --> 07:45:08,440
No.

6260
07:45:13,860 --> 07:45:16,720
Yeah, I fell for, like, 50 minutes or some shit.

6261
07:45:23,830 --> 07:45:26,990
This is, like, this is reverse parkour.

6262
07:45:27,590 --> 07:45:36,600
I feel like I'm doing reverse parkour right now.

6263
07:45:40,570 --> 07:45:43,710
No, the glide is most definitely very silly.

6264
07:45:44,070 --> 07:45:45,510
The worm ways!

6265
07:45:48,690 --> 07:45:50,070
Holy shit, this area is big.

6266
07:46:03,590 --> 07:46:05,590
I got a purse.

6267
07:46:07,050 --> 07:46:08,930
Oh, I hear it.

6268
07:46:09,710 --> 07:46:10,650
Ooh, shallow.

6269
07:46:12,110 --> 07:46:13,150
I've got him.

6270
07:46:14,770 --> 07:46:15,870
Lai, lai, lai.

6271
07:46:17,190 --> 07:46:18,110
Where is she?

6272
07:46:22,310 --> 07:46:23,310
I hear her.

6273
07:46:25,150 --> 07:46:26,870
I'm gonna grab Helos real quick.

6274
07:46:27,990 --> 07:46:28,550
I'm scared.

6275
07:46:30,370 --> 07:46:31,410
I'm so scared.

6276
07:46:32,650 --> 07:46:33,030
Oh.

6277
07:46:37,160 --> 07:46:38,400
Oh, Shalom.

6278
07:46:39,440 --> 07:46:40,460
Oh, there she is!

6279
07:46:41,700 --> 07:46:42,460
Greetings, Shakira.

6280
07:46:43,040 --> 07:46:45,020
It was a welcome surprise to hear your calls.

6281
07:46:45,720 --> 07:46:47,080
Echo through these crumbling tunnels.

6282
07:46:47,680 --> 07:46:49,180
How goes the search for your master?

6283
07:46:50,280 --> 07:46:54,100
Poshanka, it is a difficult task to track anything in these caverns.

6284
07:46:54,440 --> 07:46:57,040
while the worms ceaselessly churned a rock.

6285
07:46:57,540 --> 07:47:00,300
Still, I can see that Master has traveled here.

6286
07:47:00,780 --> 07:47:03,540
Her path within this land swings, strangely.

6287
07:47:03,920 --> 07:47:04,940
I wonder at her intent.

6288
07:47:05,260 --> 07:47:06,660
It is no matter, though.

6289
07:47:07,040 --> 07:47:08,900
She can enlighten me when again we meet.

6290
07:47:09,340 --> 07:47:11,880
Until then, I'll continue in her shadows.

6291
07:47:12,320 --> 07:47:13,220
All right, $70.

6292
07:47:13,700 --> 07:47:14,400
I am poor.

6293
07:47:14,900 --> 07:47:15,280
Goodbye.

6294
07:47:15,520 --> 07:47:17,880
I will figure this out.

6295
07:47:20,100 --> 07:47:22,320
That wind will guide me, I guess.

6296
07:47:23,580 --> 07:47:24,180
Yes.

6297
07:47:30,610 --> 07:47:32,610
It might be a very...

6298
07:47:35,110 --> 07:47:36,230
Did this...

6299
07:47:36,230 --> 07:47:37,270
Was that two damage?

6300
07:47:38,350 --> 07:47:40,930
That was two damage, wasn't it?

6301
07:47:41,970 --> 07:47:43,490
I fucking knew it.

6302
07:47:46,050 --> 07:47:47,070
Fuck this.

6303
07:47:54,370 --> 07:47:55,670
I knew it.

6304
07:47:56,490 --> 07:48:00,430
I could feel the two damage in my blood.

6305
07:48:02,450 --> 07:48:06,090
The only ones that don't do two damage are these fucking damn colors.

6306
07:48:06,110 --> 07:48:15,550
this that's the only joy in life that I get oh

6307
07:48:18,640 --> 07:48:21,240

6310
07:49:23,090 --> 07:49:23,630
No.

6311
07:49:24,810 --> 07:49:26,150
Keep singing to me.

6312
07:49:28,690 --> 07:49:29,570
Oh my god.

6313
07:49:30,070 --> 07:49:31,090
I have just enough.

6314
07:49:34,070 --> 07:49:38,890
I'm like, actually like, like scrounging for pennies right now.

6315
07:49:39,250 --> 07:49:44,530
I'm like going to vending machines, checking the little slots of anybody like left cash in there.

6316
07:49:44,930 --> 07:49:49,390
I'm like going to longer maps, like being like, can you please spare some change?

6317
07:49:49,730 --> 07:49:51,790
I just, please, I just need like five dollars.

6318
07:49:51,810 --> 07:49:57,670
Like, please, maybe, like, you can, I, 25 cents, 125 cents is good enough for me.

6319
07:49:58,010 --> 07:49:59,690
Please, I spare some change.

6320
07:49:59,970 --> 07:50:03,850
Like, this is how I feel right now.

6321
07:50:04,170 --> 07:50:06,010
That sounds so damn sad.

6322
07:50:06,250 --> 07:50:07,730
That's all I'm feeling.

6323
07:50:08,210 --> 07:50:09,070
I know.

6324
07:50:09,350 --> 07:50:11,530
I know it sounds sad.

6325
07:50:11,930 --> 07:50:14,290
But this is my life now.

6326
07:50:17,290 --> 07:50:20,870
Please, sir, can I have some spare change?

6327
07:50:23,810 --> 07:50:25,530
wait are these children

6328
07:50:29,750 --> 07:50:37,870
you don't understand I have to kill these kids a kid for a kid

6329
07:50:43,450 --> 07:50:52,750
guys a kid for a kid oh my god what the fuck oh What the fuck?

6330
07:50:55,030 --> 07:50:55,630
Okay.

6331
07:50:58,750 --> 07:51:00,270
There are a lot of money.

6332
07:51:01,850 --> 07:51:04,570
Oh my god, okay, I almost fucked that up.

6333
07:51:09,250 --> 07:51:10,630
A kid for a kid.

6334
07:51:13,650 --> 07:51:15,010
It's only fair.

6335
07:51:18,560 --> 07:51:19,920
It's down there.

6336
07:51:22,500 --> 07:51:23,880
Man, if only I have a key.

6337
07:51:30,880 --> 07:51:32,480
Let's not go there.

6338
07:51:33,880 --> 07:51:37,140
That looked absolutely terrible.

6339
07:51:42,340 --> 07:51:45,080
That was very scary.

6340
07:51:46,160 --> 07:51:46,200
Yeah.

6341
07:51:51,580 --> 07:51:53,980
Okay, we just need one more mask for an HP.

6342
07:51:59,180 --> 07:52:00,640
All right, let's look at this again.

6343
07:52:04,270 --> 07:52:09,190
Okay, it's not as bad as I thought it was, but let's have HP first.

6344
07:52:12,130 --> 07:52:14,450
I wonder if the children respawn.

6345
07:52:15,430 --> 07:52:15,450
Yeah.

6346
07:52:21,010 --> 07:52:22,950
Okay, I actually need money.

6347
07:52:26,950 --> 07:52:29,330
I need to figure out something that...

6348
07:52:29,330 --> 07:52:31,290
What are the worms?

6349
07:52:39,440 --> 07:52:39,860
Okay.

6350
07:52:42,360 --> 07:52:43,400
Oh my god.

6351
07:52:43,480 --> 07:52:44,720

6413
07:58:52,810 --> 07:58:54,330
He's so fast.

6414
07:58:56,210 --> 07:58:56,810
Like...

6415
07:58:56,810 --> 07:59:00,230
I don't expect him to be that fast.

6416
07:59:01,050 --> 07:59:01,690
There you go.

6417
07:59:03,090 --> 07:59:03,850

6427
08:00:26,170 --> 08:00:28,150
He's gonna respawn.

6428
08:00:30,030 --> 08:00:33,610

08:01:59,710 --> 08:02:00,330
That's it.

6437
08:02:04,590 --> 08:02:07,810
This is a real endurance.

6438
08:02:16,260 --> 08:02:19,720

6439
08:02:22,500 --> 08:02:26,860

Peekaboo!

6443
08:02:38,240 --> 08:02:41,220
5 viewers skip 12 minutes.

6446
08:03:16,660 --> 08:03:19,280
The most intense peekaboo of my life.

6447
08:03:22,240 --> 08:03:22,800
Holy shit.

6448
08:03:23,060 --> 08:03:28,000
I've never peekabooed harder than I've had than I did before.

6449
08:03:31,280 --> 08:03:32,420
What a wild ride.

6450
08:03:34,080 --> 08:03:35,080
Where is this?

6451
08:03:36,140 --> 08:03:37,080
Moss home.

6452
08:03:38,860 --> 08:03:39,940
Never been here

6453
08:03:46,210 --> 08:03:47,390
I can't be bothered.

6454
08:03:47,570 --> 08:03:48,590
I'm just going to kill these guys.

6455
08:03:50,750 --> 08:03:53,170
Have you ever played peekaboo with your life on...

6456
08:03:53,170 --> 08:03:56,310
Oh my god, it's the first farm spot.

6457
08:03:56,510 --> 08:03:59,150
I remember this area now.

6458
08:04:00,530 --> 08:04:03,310
It's the very first Groundhog Day.

6459
08:04:07,160 --> 08:04:08,720
I remember you.

6460
08:04:12,750 --> 08:04:14,690
Okay, we don't have to go here, actually.

6461
08:04:15,050 --> 08:04:16,210
I want to go this back.

6462
08:04:16,690 --> 08:04:20,930
Because there is an area that we haven't gone to and it's near me falling down.

6463
08:04:24,500 --> 08:04:25,660
This brings back memories.

6464
08:04:26,080 --> 08:04:26,080
Yes.

6465
08:04:26,620 --> 08:04:27,880
The very first farm.

6466
08:04:31,930 --> 08:04:33,650
Oh, at least we can rob some people.

6467
08:04:34,510 --> 08:04:35,830
One more time.

6468
08:04:38,890 --> 08:04:39,870
And there's...

6469
08:04:39,870 --> 08:04:40,510
Oh, nice.

6470
08:04:48,960 --> 08:04:50,120
Oh, that's unlucky.

6471
08:04:52,320 --> 08:04:52,920
Jesus.

6472
08:04:54,000 --> 08:04:54,560
Maybe here?

6473
08:04:54,640 --> 08:04:55,460
There's something here.

6474
08:05:01,860 --> 08:05:02,920
Oh, my Oh my god!

6475
08:05:07,090 --> 08:05:08,170
Okay, that was some sick...

6476
08:05:08,170 --> 08:05:08,410
Oh!

6477
08:05:11,250 --> 08:05:12,450
Yay, money!

6478
08:05:12,670 --> 08:05:14,070
Okay, that was...

6479
08:05:14,070 --> 08:05:18,130
Now I can say that was some sick ass...

6480
08:05:18,130 --> 08:05:20,190
Sick ass reflexes right there.

6481
08:05:20,330 --> 08:05:20,550
Wait.

6482
08:05:20,930 --> 08:05:21,930
Oh, he's holding the fruit.

6483
08:05:23,370 --> 08:05:28,370
Remember that witch doctor lady that asked us to do that one mission thing and I didn't do it?

6484
08:05:31,110 --> 08:05:31,630
Oh!

6485
08:05:31,770 --> 08:05:33,270
Guess I can't do it again!

6486
08:05:34,730 --> 08:05:39,330
I guess I won't be able to do it again, guys.

6487
08:05:41,050 --> 08:05:41,690
Unlucky.

6488
08:05:46,810 --> 08:05:47,450
Okay.

6489
08:05:49,170 --> 08:05:49,950
Where can we?

6490
08:05:50,010 --> 08:05:51,610
Okay, we explored all of that.

6491
08:05:52,350 --> 08:05:53,370
What have we not got?

6492
08:05:55,730 --> 08:05:57,530
Oh, that area in Shelwood.

6493
08:05:58,630 --> 08:05:58,950
Rough.

6494
08:06:02,540 --> 08:06:04,060
I can't open anything.

6495
08:06:08,160 --> 08:06:08,680
Ada!

6496
08:06:13,700 --> 08:06:14,440
It's 300?

6497
08:06:16,580 --> 08:06:17,740
I'll think about it.

6498
08:06:18,000 --> 08:06:20,820
I want to explore that last area.

6499
08:06:22,000 --> 08:06:23,540
That I didn't go in shellwood.

6500
08:06:26,900 --> 08:06:28,060
No, it's not key time.

6501
08:06:28,180 --> 08:06:28,680
Not yet.

6502
08:06:30,200 --> 08:06:33,040
I want to go... Okay, it's down and up.

6503
08:06:34,820 --> 08:06:36,120
Okay, not this up.

6504
08:06:37,080 --> 08:06:38,480
This is where I saved the dog.

6505
08:06:39,460 --> 08:06:39,980
Okay.

6506
08:06:43,380 --> 08:07:13,660
yeah this way when will it ever be key time someday maybe one day but you said that 20 years ago maybe you just gotta be patient They'll never be Kidae if you're never patient, guys.

6507
08:07:18,880 --> 08:07:19,940
Just gotta wait.

6508
08:07:20,300 --> 08:07:22,040
Good things come to those who...

6509
08:07:22,040 --> 08:07:23,220
Oh my god.

6510
08:07:23,880 --> 08:07:25,120
Goddamn stick, bud.

6511
08:07:28,880 --> 08:07:30,660
I hope he drowns.

6512
08:07:35,760 --> 08:07:37,740
Okay, this is the area I haven't gone yet.

6513
08:07:39,060 --> 08:07:39,540
What's this?

6514
08:07:39,640 --> 08:07:40,480
Oh, someone is here.

6515
08:07:41,280 --> 08:07:41,580
Hello?

6516
08:07:42,800 --> 08:07:43,440
Oh?

6517
08:07:44,940 --> 08:07:45,580
Shh.

6518
08:07:46,760 --> 08:07:52,700
Shill, white mask, red cloak, bug, a living bug.

6519
08:07:53,000 --> 08:07:53,660
To me again.

6520
08:07:55,860 --> 08:08:00,040
A bug I am, at least in part, but you're something quite different.

6521
08:08:00,620 --> 08:08:03,660
I apologize if I roused you from some deep slumber.

6522
08:08:04,780 --> 08:08:06,360
Slumber, non-sleep.

6523
08:08:07,260 --> 08:08:09,100
But now is the waking.

6524
08:08:10,280 --> 08:08:12,600
Growth, time of birth.

6525
08:08:13,300 --> 08:08:15,340
The time of birth approaches.

6526
08:08:16,500 --> 08:08:17,760
Heed, bug.

6527
08:08:18,360 --> 08:08:20,320
The time of birth approaches.

6528
08:08:22,180 --> 08:08:23,020
Was he just born?

6529
08:08:25,280 --> 08:08:26,320
Only you are left.

6530
08:08:26,760 --> 08:08:27,740
No more tread here.

6531
08:08:28,340 --> 08:08:28,700
None.

6532
08:08:29,560 --> 08:08:30,000
For the right.

6533
08:08:30,240 --> 08:08:31,740
The pallet hearts there needed.

6534
08:08:32,300 --> 08:08:33,160
Bring them here.

6535
08:08:33,640 --> 08:08:34,400
For the right.

6536
08:08:34,820 --> 08:08:35,600
Oh, I have some.

6537
08:08:38,580 --> 08:08:39,660
Wish promised.

6538
08:08:40,080 --> 08:08:41,220
I have so many promises.

6539
08:08:43,100 --> 08:08:43,940
I'll eat you.

6540
08:08:43,960 --> 08:08:44,720
These pot...

6541
08:08:44,720 --> 08:08:45,320
They can be found.

6542
08:08:45,340 --> 08:09:09,740

6543
08:09:15,320 --> 08:09:16,540
Yeah, no.

6544
08:09:18,400 --> 08:09:20,120
I guess we'll never meet again.

6545
08:09:21,400 --> 08:09:23,620
I mean, I know, like, these bugs.

6546
08:09:27,880 --> 08:09:28,760
Oh, my God.

6547
08:09:28,960 --> 08:09:30,400
I actually need...

6548
08:09:30,400 --> 08:09:32,800
I actually need to get out of here.

6549
08:09:34,640 --> 08:09:34,940
Oh.

6550
08:09:35,680 --> 08:09:36,540
Oh, my God.

6551
08:09:36,560 --> 08:09:37,440
I actually need to get out of here.

6552
08:09:38,460 --> 08:09:39,640
Oh, my God.

6553
08:09:39,780 --> 08:09:40,440
Get me out of here.

6554
08:09:42,540 --> 08:09:42,900
Okay.

6555
08:09:43,560 --> 08:09:44,340
I'm okay.

6556
08:09:52,440 --> 08:09:53,560
Okay, nice.

6557
08:09:54,460 --> 08:09:55,500
Free magic.

6558
08:09:57,880 --> 08:09:59,180
I'm just gonna leave.

6559
08:10:00,020 --> 08:10:00,680
He wins.

6560
08:10:01,560 --> 08:10:02,300
He won.

6561
08:10:06,820 --> 08:10:08,260
Alright, I have...

6562
08:10:10,040 --> 08:10:12,000
I have Bell right here.

6563
08:10:12,600 --> 08:10:14,700
But like I said, I can't access this anywhere.

6564
08:10:20,520 --> 08:10:21,080
Ring ring!

6565
08:10:22,580 --> 08:10:24,900
Alright, let me figure out where to go.

6566
08:10:28,200 --> 08:10:29,340
Where's my map?

6567
08:10:29,820 --> 08:10:30,400
Oh, there it is.

6568
08:10:31,060 --> 08:10:31,300
Okay.

6569
08:10:33,560 --> 08:10:34,160
What?

6570
08:10:34,900 --> 08:10:35,900
I guess?

6571
08:10:36,920 --> 08:10:37,600
Graymoor?

6572
08:10:38,200 --> 08:10:40,120
I didn't do half a graymoor.

6573
08:10:40,600 --> 08:10:42,120
I'll deliver the children.

6574
08:10:42,740 --> 08:10:43,760
And then...

6575
08:10:43,760 --> 08:10:44,400
Oh, here.

6576
08:10:44,520 --> 08:10:45,140
Hunter's March.

6577
08:10:45,280 --> 08:10:47,200
There is a place in Hunter's March, too.

6578
08:10:48,940 --> 08:10:49,200
Hmm.

6579
08:10:49,740 --> 08:10:51,200
Okay, I'll do...

6580
08:10:55,820 --> 08:10:57,980
I will do...

6581
08:11:00,220 --> 08:11:03,940
I'll deliver the children first, and then...

6582
08:11:03,940 --> 08:11:04,920
Okay, where's that children?

6583
08:11:05,020 --> 08:11:05,360
Tomorrow.

6584
08:11:05,580 --> 08:11:06,400
Okay, there you go.

6585
08:11:09,800 --> 08:11:11,160
Yeah, it's my little pet dog.

6586
08:11:11,800 --> 08:11:13,380
He's just a big-ass dog.

6587
08:11:14,440 --> 08:11:15,340
Is it bone bar?

6588
08:11:15,420 --> 08:11:16,480
Or is it deep docks?

6589
08:11:17,100 --> 08:11:17,780
Which is closer.

6590
08:11:19,260 --> 08:11:20,160
I don't remember.

6591
08:11:20,260 --> 08:11:21,220
I'll go tomorrow first.

6592
08:11:30,320 --> 08:11:30,980
Okay, yeah.

6593
08:11:31,340 --> 08:11:31,820
Oh, whoops.

6594
08:11:32,280 --> 08:11:33,560
Well, guess I'll never need that.

6595
08:11:34,180 --> 08:11:35,840
I guess I don't need the needle, guys.

6596
08:11:39,100 --> 08:11:40,220
Just in case.

6597
08:11:42,180 --> 08:11:44,280
I wonder if there's nail upgrades.

6598
08:11:44,660 --> 08:11:46,420
I haven't seen any nail upgrades yet.

6599
08:11:50,640 --> 08:11:51,920
So I don't know.

6600
08:11:57,640 --> 08:11:59,000
All right, here's the children.

6601
08:12:02,910 --> 08:12:04,330
Hello, I found all your kids.

6602
08:12:04,690 --> 08:12:05,290
Look, look!

6603
08:12:05,530 --> 08:12:07,790
So many fleas have joined the caravan.

6604
08:12:08,290 --> 08:12:09,130
What a miracle.

6605
08:12:09,550 --> 08:12:11,930
We can't thank you enough for honoring our humble wish.

6606
08:12:14,390 --> 08:12:15,730
Yay, wish granted.

6607
08:12:20,290 --> 08:12:24,890
There's so many fleas, fleas, for us to be united with, though, and we rested long enough.

6608
08:12:25,150 --> 08:12:26,910
The caravan must head higher.

6609
08:12:27,250 --> 08:12:29,470
Oh, but stranger, how remiss of me!

6610
08:12:29,790 --> 08:12:32,590
I introduced myself earlier while ever asking for your own name.

6611
08:12:32,950 --> 08:12:35,590
Forgive me, please, what shall we call you?

6612
08:12:35,690 --> 08:12:41,090
You may call me Hornet, Flea Master.

6613
08:12:41,630 --> 08:12:46,150
Know that I, like you, am glad to see your fellow fleas safe with your caravan.

6614
08:12:48,530 --> 08:12:49,290
travel alone.

6615
08:12:50,070 --> 08:12:51,850
I still have a long journey ahead of me.

6616
08:12:52,410 --> 08:12:55,470
If I come across more fleas, I will assist where I'm able.

6617
08:12:56,590 --> 08:12:58,090
Oh, Vavenda!

6618
08:12:58,550 --> 08:13:00,170
That is to say, incredible!

6619
08:13:00,850 --> 08:13:02,770
What a beautiful thing for me to hear.

6620
08:13:03,590 --> 08:13:06,910
Dear friend, Miss Hornet, our caravan must be away now.

6621
08:13:07,390 --> 08:13:09,390
Toward the wide, more high above.

6622
08:13:09,830 --> 08:13:11,790
Would you travel with us as an honored guest?

6623
08:13:12,410 --> 08:13:12,670
Sure.

6624
08:13:13,590 --> 08:13:14,030
Yes.

6625
08:13:15,010 --> 08:13:16,270
Excellent, excellent!

6626
08:13:16,970 --> 08:13:19,870
Let us make be off without delay.

6627
08:13:20,810 --> 08:13:24,110
Rouse yourself, please, for the caravan roams once more!

6628
08:13:26,870 --> 08:13:27,390
Alright.

6629
08:13:34,930 --> 08:13:35,390
Oh, shit.

6630
08:13:35,570 --> 08:13:36,470
I'm in the caravan!

6631
08:13:41,400 --> 08:13:42,620
I'm gonna blow my nose.

6632
08:13:49,080 --> 08:13:50,040
Wait, is this a new area?

6633
08:13:51,560 --> 08:13:52,080
Mushka!

6634
08:13:52,500 --> 08:13:56,060
The journey here was long, but we didn't lose a single flea.

6635
08:13:56,300 --> 08:14:01,490
I'm told it's good luck to bring guests along when traveling so we must have you to think

6636
08:14:05,890 --> 08:14:29,670
oh i want to play longer but my voice is starting to get straight we'll fight one more boss and then we'll call it i trust the trip was agreeable for you a pleasure perhaps nestled in with our dear little ones they certainly made for energetic travel companions i've not often had opportunities socialized with such a spirit of sorts.

6637
08:14:30,730 --> 08:14:31,210
Splendid!

6638
08:14:31,830 --> 08:14:36,430
And now you must go and see Yushkin, sitting there by the bubbling cauldron.

6639
08:14:36,870 --> 08:14:39,930
After long travel, we drink to revive our spirits.

6640
08:14:40,670 --> 08:14:40,990
Okay.

6641
08:14:42,290 --> 08:14:43,790
Let's go drink the cauldron.

6642
08:14:46,470 --> 08:14:51,310
The Hushka went for shelter from the thick gray hair is heavy and wet.

6643
08:14:51,870 --> 08:14:56,930
I'm worried for the little fleas' health in this land, and they make play in the filthy water.

6644
08:14:57,290 --> 08:14:58,170
I say them.

6645
08:14:58,750 --> 08:14:58,970
Stop!

6646
08:14:59,430 --> 08:15:01,250
But they just laugh and splash on me.

6647
08:15:01,570 --> 08:15:02,930
They are lack of respect.

6648
08:15:03,910 --> 08:15:06,630
Most bugs instinctively obey those with strength and will.

6649
08:15:07,150 --> 08:15:10,610
Speak with authority or your commands may go unheeded.

6650
08:15:12,010 --> 08:15:12,570
Really?

6651
08:15:13,010 --> 08:15:15,390
It's Flea Master's job to teach the flea such.

6652
08:15:15,830 --> 08:15:18,210
I will just rest here in the time to move on.

6653
08:15:18,710 --> 08:15:19,970
Uh, wait, where's the cauldron?

6654
08:15:21,870 --> 08:15:22,910
Where's the cauldron?

6655
08:15:23,450 --> 08:15:23,790
Oh, here.

6656
08:15:25,310 --> 08:15:26,230
Don't get it.

6657
08:15:26,230 --> 08:15:26,930
Don't snaw.

6658
08:15:27,230 --> 08:15:27,870
Miss Hornet.

6659
08:15:28,010 --> 08:15:28,610
Is it?

6660
08:15:29,210 --> 08:15:30,350
Welcome to our new camp.

6661
08:15:30,790 --> 08:15:33,430
The traveling is done, and so we drink.

6662
08:15:33,710 --> 08:15:35,050
He walked over?

6663
08:15:36,430 --> 08:15:38,250
Okay, I'm gonna give him a little snack.

6664
08:15:38,530 --> 08:15:39,670
Okay, I'll be right back.

6665
08:15:39,910 --> 08:15:40,730
He hungy.

6666
08:16:01,640 --> 08:16:03,540
Alright, I'm back.

6667
08:16:03,960 --> 08:16:05,280
He, like, walked over.

6668
08:16:05,500 --> 08:16:06,480
He got closer.

6669
08:16:06,900 --> 08:16:08,060
He's like, how dare you?

6670
08:16:09,360 --> 08:16:13,540
It's no better way to revive spirit than to drink the famous flea brew.

6671
08:16:14,160 --> 08:16:15,820
I'm just finished the batch.

6672
08:16:17,160 --> 08:16:18,620
You are a friend.

6673
08:16:18,900 --> 08:16:20,340
Founder of Lost Little Fleas.

6674
08:16:20,800 --> 08:16:23,180
Here, take bottle of Fleet Brew with you.

6675
08:16:23,560 --> 08:16:24,900
We'll keep you warm while travel.

6676
08:16:25,360 --> 08:16:27,840
I'm always brewing here, so I have no fear.

6677
08:16:28,080 --> 08:16:28,880
The drink plenty.

6678
08:16:29,220 --> 08:16:31,140
Return whenever you're waiting for more.

6679
08:16:31,760 --> 08:16:32,640
What is that?

6680
08:16:33,440 --> 08:16:34,240
Where am I?

6681
08:16:35,720 --> 08:16:36,800
I'm in Graymoor.

6682
08:16:37,200 --> 08:16:38,100
Wait, I'm in Graymoor.

6683
08:16:44,950 --> 08:16:45,510
Oh!

6684
08:16:47,610 --> 08:16:48,170
Wait.

6685
08:16:49,730 --> 08:16:51,210
Wait, that shit is OP.

6686
08:16:55,510 --> 08:16:56,250
Okay.

6687
08:16:58,130 --> 08:16:59,530
That's pretty fucking OP.

6688
08:16:59,830 --> 08:17:00,410
That's for sure.

6689
08:17:01,930 --> 08:17:02,770
There's like...

6690
08:17:02,770 --> 08:17:04,930
Okay, this area I could go to.

6691
08:17:06,590 --> 08:17:07,750
I guess I'll go up?

6692
08:17:11,970 --> 08:17:13,090
It says...

6693
08:17:13,090 --> 08:17:13,350
Yeah.

6694
08:17:13,830 --> 08:17:18,350
It says temporary increases the speed of movements and attacks.

6695
08:17:19,890 --> 08:17:21,430
It's a consumable...

6696
08:17:21,430 --> 08:17:22,070
Yeah, it is.

6697
08:17:27,260 --> 08:17:30,680
Okay, there's something up top that I haven't got yet.

6698
08:17:32,700 --> 08:17:34,500
I really hate the scissor people.

6699
08:17:35,540 --> 08:17:36,560
These guys are annoying.

6700
08:17:38,840 --> 08:17:41,200
Yeah, it gives an attack up.

6701
08:17:42,620 --> 08:17:47,180
Okay, um, I just want to see what's at the top.

6702
08:17:49,560 --> 08:17:50,900
God, fuck off!

6703
08:17:56,250 --> 08:17:57,320
Get out of here!

6704
08:18:00,240 --> 08:18:00,880
Yeah.

6705
08:18:04,000 --> 08:18:05,900

I just expect the worst, you know?

6824
08:27:42,860 --> 08:27:44,300
An open arena.

6825
08:27:44,600 --> 08:27:46,580
I just expect the worst thing possible.

6826
08:27:48,620 --> 08:27:49,660
I'm so paranoid.

6827
08:27:53,000 --> 08:27:53,560

08:30:51,670 --> 08:30:52,290
But I can't.

6868
08:30:52,310 --> 08:30:53,750

6888
08:32:28,460 --> 08:32:29,080
Oh, my gosh.

6889
08:32:36,820 --> 08:32:37,500
Oh

6890
08:32:52,640 --> 08:32:54,000
My god

6891
08:32:58,750 --> 08:33:05,390
Friend slow-mo That's safe, let's go Justin

6892
08:33:09,940 --> 08:33:18,180
I got the I had to save for the heal there was no thing else I could do That was so scary.

6893
08:33:22,990 --> 08:33:24,610
What did it do?

6894
08:33:25,530 --> 08:33:26,170
Did it raise?

6895
08:33:30,570 --> 08:33:31,890
Oh yeah, 100%.

6896
08:33:32,310 --> 08:33:35,910
If I knew these were the enemies I'm fucking facing, I would have.

6897
08:33:39,220 --> 08:33:40,740
It's just free money?

6898
08:33:47,720 --> 08:33:49,120
Oh my, get out.

6899
08:33:50,520 --> 08:33:52,020
This isn't for you.

6900
08:33:53,760 --> 08:33:55,380
Was this literally for money?

6901
08:33:57,620 --> 08:33:58,840
That was it?

6902
08:34:00,540 --> 08:34:04,040
I can't believe Toki's complaining about the free money.

6903
08:34:06,340 --> 08:34:08,240
That was it?

6904
08:34:10,700 --> 08:34:12,160
There's no way.

6905
08:34:16,280 --> 08:34:17,540
There has to be more.

6906
08:34:22,380 --> 08:34:24,440
To be fair, this did not feel free.

6907
08:34:25,020 --> 08:34:26,980
I earned this money.

6908
08:34:28,320 --> 08:34:29,420
It was.

6909
08:34:29,500 --> 08:34:30,580
That was actually it.

6910
08:34:33,810 --> 08:34:35,930
There's nothing else here.

6911
08:34:38,990 --> 08:34:40,010
No, I opened these.

6912
08:34:40,110 --> 08:34:46,370
I've opened these to grab the jewels, the beads there.

6913
08:34:47,010 --> 08:34:48,850
Oh my god, that was it.

6914
08:34:49,390 --> 08:34:52,430
I hate the bird, the bird bugs.

6915
08:34:53,130 --> 08:34:55,530
I hate them so much.

6916
08:34:56,210 --> 08:34:56,610
I...

6917
08:34:59,190 --> 08:35:00,810
That was it.

6918
08:35:02,510 --> 08:35:03,870
Oh, maybe this.

6919
08:35:04,310 --> 08:35:05,810
Oh, wait, I opened this.

6920
08:35:10,130 --> 08:35:13,430
Where the amazing gameplay and the multiple pairs.

6921
08:35:13,570 --> 08:35:15,430
Psycho, thank you for the super chat.

6922
08:35:15,990 --> 08:35:16,930
Thank you, thank you.

6923
08:35:17,170 --> 08:35:19,450
I'm glad you guys have been enjoying it.

6924
08:35:19,730 --> 08:35:20,730
I've been...

6925
08:35:26,850 --> 08:35:28,590
I'm sad now.

6926
08:35:32,430 --> 08:35:34,010
I hate them.

6927
08:35:38,330 --> 08:35:39,770
I'm sad.

6928
08:35:44,430 --> 08:35:46,410
I'm so sad.

6929
08:35:48,850 --> 08:35:54,550
The worst part is that they are not easy to farm at all.

6930
08:36:01,160 --> 08:36:02,620
They are not easy.

6931
08:36:08,800 --> 08:36:10,840
Oh my god, I see the birds.

6932
08:36:11,960 --> 08:36:13,540
They're literally waiting for me.

6933
08:36:18,160 --> 08:36:18,800
Okay,

6934
08:36:22,930 --> 08:36:23,330
shortcut.

6935
08:36:26,010 --> 08:36:27,630
I'm so confused what happened.

6936
08:36:27,950 --> 08:36:31,110
I'm, like, living by the edge right now.

6937
08:36:31,270 --> 08:36:32,070
That's what happened.

6938
08:36:32,810 --> 08:36:34,310
I am not okay.

6939
08:36:44,700 --> 08:36:45,060
Okay.

6940
08:36:46,400 --> 08:36:48,420
Oh my god, I got played so careful.

6941
08:36:53,660 --> 08:36:54,400
What's over there?

6942
08:36:55,440 --> 08:36:56,840
I'm gonna die to this.

6943
08:36:57,540 --> 08:36:58,080
I...

6944
08:36:59,480 --> 08:37:04,840
I'll do this When I'm not one HP I

6945
08:37:08,380 --> 08:37:12,780
That is not something I'm willing to risk

6946
08:37:16,450 --> 08:37:36,610
What They ambushed me They actually ambushed me These fucking freaks The birds.

6947
08:37:42,570 --> 08:37:43,070
Oh, thank God.

6948
08:37:43,110 --> 08:37:44,190
I opened a shortcut here.

6949
08:37:44,850 --> 08:37:46,630
Oh, thank fucking God.

6950
08:37:53,630 --> 08:37:54,130
Where's the cocoon?

6951
08:37:54,730 --> 08:37:55,950
Oh, there it is.

6952
08:37:56,470 --> 08:37:56,970
I leave.

6953
08:37:58,470 --> 08:37:59,450
Okay, I leave.

6954
08:38:05,160 --> 08:38:06,140
I leave.

6955
08:38:07,880 --> 08:38:08,940
I leave.

6956
08:38:09,460 --> 08:38:10,100
Oh, my God.

6957
08:38:10,220 --> 08:38:10,780
I leave.

6958
08:38:16,240 --> 08:38:17,500
Oh, fucking court.

6959
08:38:17,600 --> 08:38:19,600
Oh my...

6960
08:38:24,200 --> 08:38:25,120
Speedrun!

6961
08:38:25,700 --> 08:38:25,860
Yeah!

6962
08:38:29,590 --> 08:38:32,630
Guys, I did that intentionally.

6963
08:38:33,910 --> 08:38:34,650
Speedrun!

6964
08:38:39,130 --> 08:38:40,270
I lived.

6965
08:38:43,940 --> 08:38:46,080
I wanted to do that.

6966
08:38:48,960 --> 08:38:52,580
Daughter of the Sunland, we who remind have waited long.

6967
08:38:53,520 --> 08:38:54,980
Find our strength to yours.

6968
08:38:55,400 --> 08:38:57,840
Reclean the future of our haunted kingdom.

6969
08:38:58,740 --> 08:39:00,220
Oh my god, I'm getting all the power-ups.

6970
08:39:00,460 --> 08:39:02,440
Wait, I think this is...

6971
08:39:02,440 --> 08:39:03,540
Is this the last one?

6972
08:39:05,420 --> 08:39:07,700
It's double- Oh wait, I still have the crystal dash to do.

6973
08:39:10,360 --> 08:39:10,880
Redstorm.

6974
08:39:11,040 --> 08:39:12,100
It's Adidas!

6975
08:39:20,770 --> 08:39:21,290
Oh!

6976
08:39:25,220 --> 08:39:26,580
It's literally Adidas!

6977
08:39:34,210 --> 08:39:34,730
Okay.

6978
08:39:35,510 --> 08:39:36,030
Okay.

6979
08:39:36,370 --> 08:39:37,950
Watch this.

6980
08:39:38,310 --> 08:39:38,790
Adidas!

6981
08:39:39,410 --> 08:39:41,350
Okay, and I still get hit.

6982
08:39:41,770 --> 08:39:42,250
Okay.

6983
08:39:43,690 --> 08:39:44,850
Never mind.

6984
08:39:46,770 --> 08:39:50,110
I thought I looked so sick.

6985
08:39:51,430 --> 08:39:54,410
And it didn't matter anyway.

6986
08:40:01,770 --> 08:40:03,450
I'm sad.

6987
08:40:06,850 --> 08:40:07,890
Ow.

6988
08:40:09,650 --> 08:40:11,270
It didn't matter.

6989
08:40:12,250 --> 08:40:15,650
I did still look sick.

6990
08:40:17,030 --> 08:40:18,210
Okay, now where do I go?

6991
08:40:18,630 --> 08:40:19,310
I feel like I...

6992
08:40:20,530 --> 08:40:21,390
Who the fuck?

6993
08:40:22,010 --> 08:40:22,430
Oh, hey.

6994
08:40:25,650 --> 08:40:26,870
Three fold pins.

6995
08:40:29,330 --> 08:40:29,950
Wait, what?

6996
08:40:30,490 --> 08:40:31,610
Where did he go?

6997
08:40:32,230 --> 08:40:33,430
Oh my god!

6998
08:40:34,270 --> 08:40:35,350
I'm here!

6999
08:40:36,350 --> 08:40:38,370
Looking for me, bitch!

7000
08:40:44,070 --> 08:40:46,290
Oh my god, I...

7001
08:40:47,150 --> 08:40:51,170
Oh my god, I am not dying to a rat right now.

7002
08:40:54,350 --> 08:40:56,150
Okay, I don't think they...

7003
08:40:56,150 --> 08:40:57,790
Oh, fuck it again!

7004
08:41:00,110 --> 08:41:02,290
I was like, I...

7005
08:41:06,940 --> 08:41:08,300
Oh my...

7006
08:41:09,440 --> 08:41:11,240
They're so tanky.

7007
08:41:14,300 --> 08:41:15,880
Let's go, Justin!

7008
08:41:18,960 --> 08:41:20,560
There you go.

7009
08:41:22,600 --> 08:41:24,420
We saved another fleet.

7010
08:41:28,530 --> 08:41:29,130
Sick.

7011
08:41:31,150 --> 08:41:31,790
Gaming.

7012
08:41:34,270 --> 08:41:34,850
World star!

7013
08:41:39,180 --> 08:41:41,560
Oh my god, I just want to fight a boss.

7014
08:41:43,040 --> 08:41:45,060
I mean, I explored a lot of parts of this map.

7015
08:41:45,760 --> 08:41:46,880
Nice move, Justin.

7016
08:41:48,460 --> 08:41:50,120
What have I not explored?

7017
08:41:50,480 --> 08:41:54,360
I guess I don't know if I have to go there.

7018
08:41:54,540 --> 08:41:55,280
That's the thing.

7019
08:41:57,920 --> 08:41:59,680
I haven't upgraded my...

7020
08:41:59,680 --> 08:42:00,140
Oh, wait.

7021
08:42:00,440 --> 08:42:01,720
She can just...

7022
08:42:02,580 --> 08:42:03,500
Where's my chair?

7023
08:42:05,000 --> 08:42:06,640
She can just do that?

7024
08:42:06,780 --> 08:42:08,000
Take away my chair?

7025
08:42:13,260 --> 08:42:14,940
My chair is gone.

7026
08:42:19,490 --> 08:42:20,890
I mean, I guess I have this chair.

7027
08:42:22,570 --> 08:42:24,230
I don't know if I like Threadstorn.

7028
08:42:27,190 --> 08:42:29,070
I literally used it and then like...

7029
08:42:30,890 --> 08:42:33,010
And it felt like nothing happened.

7030
08:42:36,650 --> 08:42:39,470
I need to buy another memory slot though.

7031
08:42:44,490 --> 08:42:45,970
I'll just slowly float over.

7032
08:42:51,340 --> 08:42:52,560
Where do I want to go?

7033
08:42:53,940 --> 08:42:55,020
Oh wait, nice.

7034
08:42:55,880 --> 08:42:56,660
Money first.

7035
08:43:01,380 --> 08:43:03,060
Because I feel like the...

7036
08:43:03,060 --> 08:43:03,720
Okay.

7037
08:43:05,420 --> 08:43:08,020
I need her to, like, not jump in.

7038
08:43:15,700 --> 08:43:17,260
Yeah, I don't...

7039
08:43:17,260 --> 08:43:18,200
I think...

7040
08:43:19,900 --> 08:43:21,480
I don't know, actually.

7041
08:43:21,820 --> 08:43:22,520
I can't tell.

7042
08:43:23,780 --> 08:43:25,280
Do you guys think the needle or the...

7043
08:43:25,280 --> 08:43:26,700
Or Adidas is better?

7044
08:43:30,680 --> 08:43:32,660
Oh my god, that guy almost killed me.

7045
08:43:36,390 --> 08:43:38,030
I guess better for a boss.

7046
08:43:38,050 --> 08:43:39,050
You're right.

7047
08:43:39,470 --> 08:43:40,990
Adidas is better for the boss.

7048
08:43:43,210 --> 08:43:44,530
I didn't go at the very top.

7049
08:43:44,690 --> 08:43:45,850
Let's see what's at the very top.

7050
08:43:49,430 --> 08:43:50,750
Much hunting has you done?

7051
08:43:51,030 --> 08:43:53,110
Assomi, sweet little creatures in our records.

7052
08:43:53,650 --> 08:43:55,790
Nula is drooling from such exos of learning.

7053
08:43:55,970 --> 08:43:56,750
Please keep working.

7054
08:43:57,810 --> 08:43:58,030
Okay.

7055
08:43:58,810 --> 08:43:59,590
Harder to miss.

7056
08:43:59,710 --> 08:44:00,330
That's true.

7057
08:44:03,510 --> 08:44:03,530
Okay.

7058
08:44:09,450 --> 08:44:17,950
Oh, I thought like I could get somewhere from while riding while jumping that okay there is one spot i haven't gone to

7059
08:44:22,920 --> 08:44:29,780
maybe i should go there oh wait that's where oh i have to go from all the way up there okay

7060
08:44:34,750 --> 08:44:40,710
i'll go all the way over there that's annoying Here, give me a...

7061
08:44:43,950 --> 08:44:45,510
Let me look at this.

7062
08:44:48,880 --> 08:44:50,240
I don't need this.

7063
08:44:52,660 --> 08:44:53,920
Is there anything here?

7064
08:44:55,100 --> 08:44:55,540
No.

7065
08:44:56,440 --> 08:44:56,880
Okay.

7066
08:44:57,500 --> 08:44:58,460
I have to go...

7067
08:45:01,400 --> 08:45:02,420
Go all the way up.

7068
08:45:03,660 --> 08:45:07,460
I'm trying to explore as much as I can on the map to figure out where to go.

7069
08:45:08,000 --> 08:45:08,600
What the fuck?

7070
08:45:08,640 --> 08:45:09,120
I hate them.

7071
08:45:09,240 --> 08:45:10,160
I hate these guys.

7072
08:45:10,320 --> 08:45:10,840
I hate him.

7073
08:45:11,400 --> 08:45:13,600
My hate will never end for these guys.

7074
08:45:18,740 --> 08:45:19,900
He's like, I'm gonna get you.

7075
08:45:20,580 --> 08:45:21,780
I'm gonna get you.

7076
08:45:26,530 --> 08:45:28,030
And then there's the rats.

7077
08:45:30,270 --> 08:45:31,850
Okay, I'm gonna go left side.

7078
08:45:32,650 --> 08:45:34,110
I haven't gotten the left yet.

7079
08:45:37,550 --> 08:45:38,370
Oh, shit.

7080
08:45:43,420 --> 08:45:43,900
Nice.

7081
08:45:47,610 --> 08:45:48,690
It's over here.

7082
08:45:50,650 --> 08:45:51,610
What the fuck?

7083
08:45:52,830 --> 08:45:53,850
What the fuck is that?

7084
08:45:58,770 --> 08:46:00,530
What the fuck is that?

7085
08:46:03,430 --> 08:46:04,590
He disappeared.

7086
08:46:08,730 --> 08:46:09,490
Knock, knock.

7087
08:46:10,790 --> 08:46:12,150
Who's bothering me now?

7088
08:46:12,470 --> 08:46:13,950
Leave the great Yonobie in peace.

7089
08:46:14,250 --> 08:46:14,690
Shushu!

7090
08:46:20,600 --> 08:46:22,720
Oh my god, this guy's are annoying.

7091
08:46:25,180 --> 08:46:26,720
That guy's fucking annoying.

7092
08:46:28,260 --> 08:46:28,660
No!

7093
08:46:30,400 --> 08:47:00,980
Should I say Unless you brought a worthy specimen with something truly nasty inside then Otherwise leave the great Yarnaby in peace I'll call him again Nano Oh okay I don't have anything cool I guess I Sorry the great Yarnaby I don't have anything cool What's up top Is this an arena that I have to worry about about later?

7094
08:47:03,420 --> 08:47:05,640
Wait, wait.

7095
08:47:06,440 --> 08:47:06,920
Wait.

7096
08:47:11,930 --> 08:47:12,710
Is there anything here?

7097
08:47:13,350 --> 08:47:13,670
Okay.

7098
08:47:15,850 --> 08:47:16,470
Oh, nice.

7099
08:47:17,630 --> 08:47:18,130
The freight?

7100
08:47:18,250 --> 08:47:18,650
Oh, nice.

7101
08:47:18,710 --> 08:47:19,870
I steal her fucking money.

7102
08:47:20,010 --> 08:47:20,310
That's right.

7103
08:47:20,350 --> 08:47:21,470
You deserve it, bitch.

7104
08:47:23,190 --> 08:47:24,010
That's right.

7105
08:47:24,490 --> 08:47:26,210
You wouldn't open the door from me?

7106
08:47:26,590 --> 08:47:28,570
Goodbye to your goddamn rosary.

7107
08:47:31,270 --> 08:47:32,570

too.

7110
08:48:06,800 --> 08:48:08,000
Can I actually get there?

7111
08:48:10,220 --> 08:48:10,920
Alright, let's see.

7112
08:48:12,200 --> 08:48:14,520
Let's see if we can parkour that.

7113
08:48:21,450 --> 08:48:22,250
Carl!

7114
08:48:23,790 --> 08:48:24,190
Ow!

7115
08:48:25,610 --> 08:48:26,250
Rude!

7116
08:48:28,510 --> 08:48:30,410
Oh my god.

7117
08:48:32,830 --> 08:48:33,630
Okay.

7118
08:48:34,690 --> 08:48:38,690
I might have to actually use them as a platform.

7119
08:48:38,730 --> 08:48:38,770
Okay.

7120
08:48:39,570 --> 08:48:41,250
Oh my god!

7121
08:48:41,610 --> 08:48:42,750
Okay, we're gonna finish this out.

7122
08:48:43,710 --> 08:48:44,270
Unless...

7123
08:48:44,270 --> 08:48:44,810
Oh wait, no.

7124
08:48:45,070 --> 08:48:45,590
Ha ha, JK.

7125
08:48:46,150 --> 08:48:47,350
I have wall jump.

7126
08:48:49,970 --> 08:48:52,630
It's like that boom dogs clip.

7127
08:48:53,410 --> 08:48:53,590
Uh-huh.

7128
08:48:54,110 --> 08:48:54,770
What am I...

7129
08:48:54,770 --> 08:48:55,130
No.

7130
08:48:55,610 --> 08:48:56,610
What am I doing?

7131
08:48:56,850 --> 08:48:57,050
Ha-ha.

7132
08:48:57,150 --> 08:48:57,710
I'm white.

7133
08:48:59,050 --> 08:49:00,150
What am I doing?

7134
08:49:00,390 --> 08:49:00,770
Ha-ha.

7135
08:49:01,270 --> 08:49:02,070
I have...

7136
08:49:03,370 --> 08:49:04,930
I have wall dash.

7137
08:49:05,490 --> 08:49:06,250
Sinner's road?

7138
08:49:06,850 --> 08:49:07,230
Oh.

7139
08:49:13,280 --> 08:49:14,640
Holy fuck.

7140
08:49:16,780 --> 08:49:20,380
Oh, my God.

7141
08:49:22,220 --> 08:49:23,380
Oh, my God.

7142
08:49:23,760 --> 08:49:26,640
The floor is actually lava right now.

7143
08:49:28,280 --> 08:49:28,600
Oh, my God.

7144
08:49:28,740 --> 08:49:29,920
The floor is lava.

7145
08:49:30,460 --> 08:49:33,720
Do not, I repeat, do not go touch the door.

7146
08:49:41,450 --> 08:49:43,410
Oh, it's like a prison.

7147
08:49:47,090 --> 08:49:53,110
Oh, it's a prison now.

7148
08:49:55,550 --> 08:49:57,150
I hear you.

7149
08:49:57,870 --> 08:49:58,170
Jesus.

7150
08:49:59,810 --> 08:50:00,510
It's not here.

7151
08:50:01,630 --> 08:50:02,570
Or is it higher?

7152
08:50:03,930 --> 08:50:04,690
I don't know.

7153
08:50:07,490 --> 08:50:08,910
I have no map.

7154
08:50:09,370 --> 08:50:12,110
I have no direction to base this on.

7155
08:50:13,730 --> 08:50:14,650
just float down.

7156
08:50:19,390 --> 08:50:20,830
Leave me be, Traveler.

7157
08:50:21,130 --> 08:50:26,090
Better accept this kingdom's cruelty than rage, harm helpless against it.

7158
08:50:26,530 --> 08:50:28,550
To waste in a cell, forgotten.

7159
08:50:29,150 --> 08:50:34,530
This knows worse of fate than the haunting that binds Harlem's many fragile minds.

7160
08:50:35,130 --> 08:50:36,130
As you wish, prisoner.

7161
08:50:36,450 --> 08:50:37,030
It's like, alright.

7162
08:50:37,770 --> 08:50:38,010
Whatever.

7163
08:50:44,110 --> 08:50:44,630
Alright!

7164
08:50:46,830 --> 08:50:49,070
Oh my god, it's poison swamp.

7165
08:50:53,180 --> 08:50:55,380
There has to be a power up for that.

7166
08:50:55,720 --> 08:50:57,880
I refuse to believe there is no.

7167
08:50:58,840 --> 08:50:59,480
We're there.

7168
08:51:00,520 --> 08:51:01,900
We're in poison swamps.

7169
08:51:03,560 --> 08:51:05,440
Oh my god.

7170
08:51:06,560 --> 08:51:09,000
Get these maggots off me!

7171
08:51:13,000 --> 08:51:14,300
Oh my god.

7172
08:51:14,440 --> 08:51:15,880
I think I might die.

7173
08:51:18,940 --> 08:51:20,500
I might die up.

7174
08:51:20,520 --> 08:51:22,640
Oh my god, they're still there.

7175
08:51:23,060 --> 08:51:26,320
They're still there sucking my fucking life blood.

7176
08:51:32,280 --> 08:51:34,480
Oh my god, they are actually...

7177
08:51:35,480 --> 08:51:37,300
It's never stopped.

7178
08:51:41,580 --> 08:51:43,280
I'm at poison swamps.

7179
08:51:43,700 --> 08:51:45,660
This is the dark souls of Metrovania.

7180
08:51:46,220 --> 08:51:47,320
I'm all...

7181
08:51:47,320 --> 08:51:47,880
Okay.

7182
08:51:49,380 --> 08:51:51,140
How do I...

7183
08:51:51,140 --> 08:51:53,040
How do I get there?

7184
08:51:59,960 --> 08:52:00,560
Okay.

7185
08:52:05,770 --> 08:52:11,030
I have to go to Sinner's Road, but to get to Sinner's Road I...

7186
08:52:11,030 --> 08:52:12,990
It's Bloodtown 2.0.

7187
08:52:14,910 --> 08:52:16,590
I can't believe it.

7188
08:52:17,430 --> 08:52:19,290
They brought me back to Blighttown.

7189
08:52:26,620 --> 08:52:28,940
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

7190
08:52:29,000 --> 08:52:29,260
Okay.

7191
08:52:30,160 --> 08:52:31,520
I messed up there.

7192
08:52:36,980 --> 08:52:37,540
Is it here?

7193
08:52:37,860 --> 08:52:38,180
No.

7194
08:52:38,620 --> 08:52:38,920
What?

7195
08:52:39,080 --> 08:52:39,740
Damn it.

7196
08:52:44,550 --> 08:52:45,930
Oh my god.

7197
08:52:46,430 --> 08:52:48,070
Almost let the rat get me.

7198
08:52:48,750 --> 08:52:49,230
I know.

7199
08:52:49,590 --> 08:52:51,190
I have $500.

7200
08:52:52,790 --> 08:52:53,170
Guys.

7201
08:52:54,710 --> 08:52:56,950
If there's anyone that knows, it's...

7202
08:52:56,950 --> 08:52:58,110
Oh my god!

7203
08:52:58,470 --> 08:52:58,570
My!

7204
08:53:12,280 --> 08:53:13,820
Slow and steady.

7205
08:53:15,040 --> 08:53:16,960
Slow and slow.

7206
08:53:19,240 --> 08:53:20,540
Guys, he's...

7207
08:53:20,540 --> 08:53:22,120
Guys, he's camping me.

7208
08:53:26,780 --> 08:53:27,460
Um...

7209
08:53:27,460 --> 08:53:27,920
Oh.

7210
08:53:29,000 --> 08:53:29,680
Oh.

7211
08:53:29,680 --> 08:53:32,440
I do not feel so good.

7212
08:53:38,680 --> 08:53:40,380
Oh my god.

7213
08:53:42,820 --> 08:53:44,220
Oh my god!

7214
08:53:45,480 --> 08:53:46,160
Ring,

7215
08:53:51,510 --> 08:53:54,710
ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

7216
08:53:55,530 --> 08:53:57,510
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

7217
08:53:58,670 --> 08:54:01,590
I rest that bone barrel.

7218
08:54:06,370 --> 08:54:07,470
Objective, survive.

7219
08:54:09,350 --> 08:54:13,350
First off, I'm finding a bench so I can sit down.

7220
08:54:14,690 --> 08:54:18,370
Sit down, and then we go back to our cocoon.

7221
08:54:21,590 --> 08:54:23,670
Oh, that was so scary.

7222
08:54:32,290 --> 08:54:32,950
Graymoor.

7223
08:54:33,110 --> 08:54:34,690
I was like, where was this place?

7224
08:54:35,310 --> 08:54:35,990
Okay.

7225
08:54:37,330 --> 08:54:38,890
Oh, so scared.

7226
08:54:40,590 --> 08:54:40,830
Okay.

7227
08:54:43,030 --> 08:54:43,450
Oh.

7228
08:54:45,070 --> 08:54:45,430
Oh.

7229
08:54:51,460 --> 08:54:51,980
How?

7230
08:54:52,480 --> 08:54:53,080
Oh, my God.

7231
08:54:53,240 --> 08:54:53,580
This guy.

7232
08:54:53,900 --> 08:54:54,600
The long boy.

7233
08:54:54,900 --> 08:54:55,820
The long millipede.

7234
08:54:58,880 --> 08:55:03,700
I feel like every enemy is definitely very well designed and unique.

7235
08:55:04,300 --> 08:55:05,580
But, oh my gosh.

7236
08:55:05,660 --> 08:55:09,580
The common enemies are so much more frustrating than Hollow Knight.

7237
08:55:16,200 --> 08:55:28,000
um this thank you for the welcome to tomato farm welcome welcome yeah it's very rough and they do like combo damage too which is the rough part

7238
08:55:32,450 --> 08:55:37,030
they're very well designed but they do combo damage for like

7239
08:55:42,630 --> 08:55:55,330
oh this goes down okay oops oh i could have oh i could have taken the elevator I did not realize.

7240
08:56:01,120 --> 08:56:02,660
It's just, it's definitely a jump.

7241
08:56:03,200 --> 08:56:06,680
Like, like I said, like, Hollow Knight was like, welcome to kindergarten.

7242
08:56:07,200 --> 08:56:09,920
And then Silk Song was like, now you're in university.

7243
08:56:10,280 --> 08:56:11,240
And I'm like, huh?

7244
08:56:20,930 --> 08:56:22,010
Oh, God!

7245
08:56:22,470 --> 08:56:22,470
Oh,

08:56:27,990 --> 08:56:31,030
don't let the dogs get you.

7247
08:56:33,470 --> 08:56:34,690
Don't let the dogs.

There's a lever.

7297
09:02:29,380 --> 09:02:30,660
There's a bench.

7298
09:02:32,240 --> 09:02:32,940
Are you?

7299
09:02:34,380 --> 09:02:36,580

7300
09:02:41,520 --> 09:02:42,960

7302
09:02:48,490 --> 09:02:49,970
I did it!

7303
09:02:50,310 --> 09:02:51,150
Oh my!

7304
09:02:51,430 --> 09:02:52,510
This area...

7305
09:02:52,510 --> 09:02:52,970
No!

7306
09:02:53,350 --> 09:02:55,610
This area... This area sucks the most.

7307
09:02:56,270 --> 09:02:58,010
This... The fear...

7308
09:02:58,010 --> 09:03:01,050
This area... I found the new worst area.

7309
09:03:01,790 --> 09:03:02,490
I...

7310
09:03:05,690 --> 09:03:07,430
It's this area.

7311
09:03:08,790 --> 09:03:11,630
Where's my fucking...

7312
09:03:11,630 --> 09:03:14,530

09:03:19,970 --> 09:03:22,830
Oh my god, it's stuck.

09:03:25,150 --> 09:03:26,830
It's actually stuck.

7315
09:03:29,250 --> 09:03:30,190
It's stuck.

7316
09:03:38,130 --> 09:03:45,150
Had thought not upon closer note, look, I found the fragments of trail winding through these ruins.

7317
09:03:45,670 --> 09:03:47,830

I paid sixty dollars!

7322
09:05:29,100 --> 09:05:31,640
I don't know what to do!

7323
09:05:33,660 --> 09:05:36,460
I'm actually stuck here!

7324
09:05:48,320 --> 09:05:50,140
Guys, do I do it?

7325
09:05:52,920 --> 09:05:55,000
Do I do it?

7326
09:06:15,500 --> 09:06:17,740
Why is it stuck?

7327
09:06:25,250 --> 09:06:26,490
It's not.

7328
09:06:27,010 --> 09:06:27,490
It's not.

7329
09:06:28,010 --> 09:06:28,510
It's not.

7330
09:06:29,730 --> 09:06:30,770
Oh my god!

7331
09:06:50,040 --> 09:06:52,700
How do I fucking fix it?

7332
09:06:53,340 --> 09:06:55,480
Why is it stuck?

7333
09:07:02,890 --> 09:07:03,650
Why?

7334
09:07:06,910 --> 09:07:08,570
Why is it stuck?

7335
09:07:16,910 --> 09:07:18,550
I don't understand.

7336
09:07:22,490 --> 09:07:24,090
But why is it stuck?

7337
09:07:29,260 --> 09:07:29,620
Okay.

7338
09:07:31,360 --> 09:07:33,280
I gotta figure out how to get home.

7339
09:07:34,240 --> 09:07:35,500
Give me a sec.

7340
09:07:39,410 --> 09:07:40,490
How do I get home?

7341
09:07:40,570 --> 09:07:42,190
Wait, where am I?

7342
09:07:47,980 --> 09:07:49,360
Can I just fall down?

7343
09:07:57,630 --> 09:08:01,270
Oh my god.

7344
09:08:01,650 --> 09:08:01,950
Oh my god.

7345
09:08:02,350 --> 09:08:02,770
Oh my god.

7346
09:08:03,230 --> 09:08:04,030
I could just fall.

7347
09:08:04,170 --> 09:08:04,970
Oh my god.

7348
09:08:05,490 --> 09:08:06,790
It's dog time.

7349
09:08:15,720 --> 09:08:16,160
No!

7350
09:08:22,090 --> 09:08:23,390
I'm thinking.

7351
09:08:26,210 --> 09:08:27,810
I got...

7352
09:08:27,810 --> 09:08:28,850
I got...

7353
09:08:28,850 --> 09:08:31,030
I got chopped by a dog.

7354
09:08:31,670 --> 09:08:32,270
I got...

7355
09:08:32,270 --> 09:08:34,470
At least it's closer.

7356
09:08:34,790 --> 09:08:35,810
At least it's closer.

7357
09:08:36,110 --> 09:08:37,330
I just gotta get through it.

7358
09:08:38,270 --> 09:08:40,870
I gotta get through the dog.

7359
09:08:42,430 --> 09:08:43,910
The dogs don't fight.

7360
09:08:44,390 --> 09:08:45,150
The dog.

7361
09:08:49,500 --> 09:08:51,100
Holy fuck.

7362
09:08:51,960 --> 09:08:57,120
I think that air is definitely the next step in...

7363
09:08:57,120 --> 09:08:58,040
Okay.

7364
09:08:58,740 --> 09:08:59,560
My plan.

7365
09:09:01,640 --> 09:09:02,620
My plan.

7366
09:09:04,220 --> 09:09:08,400
I wanted to fight a boss, but I don't think I want to be here anymore.

7367
09:09:08,540 --> 09:09:10,220
I don't want to play that area.

7368
09:09:16,060 --> 09:09:19,020
I don't like the poison swamp.

7369
09:09:19,500 --> 09:09:22,960
I do not like the poison swamp.

7370
09:09:30,550 --> 09:09:32,740
Do I have enough walkie?

7371
09:09:33,360 --> 09:09:34,320
I don't know.

7372
09:09:34,520 --> 09:09:35,780
I just need to...

7373
09:09:35,780 --> 09:09:37,880
I need to get past the dog first.

7374
09:09:38,560 --> 09:10:12,440
oh my god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god they're coming after me oh fuck it's over here all right how much money do i have at 250 oh yeah i don't have okay so we buy wait Okay, we can buy...

7375

Alright.

7376
09:10:14,020 --> 09:10:14,860
Here's the plan.

7377
09:10:16,260 --> 09:10:18,280
We buy the mask shard.

7378
09:10:18,680 --> 09:10:20,240
So at least we have extra HP.

7379
09:10:20,800 --> 09:10:21,780
Now I don't know.

7380
09:10:22,200 --> 09:10:23,340
Okay, tram is this way.

7381
09:10:24,340 --> 09:10:24,520
Okay.

7382
09:10:30,440 --> 09:10:31,700
Holy shit.

7383
09:10:35,990 --> 09:10:38,930
I really don't want to go back to that area.

7384
09:10:39,590 --> 09:10:41,170
I don't...

7385
09:10:42,510 --> 09:10:44,450
I can't... I don't know.

7386
09:10:44,450 --> 09:10:47,310
Does the nail smith even exist?

7387
09:10:50,410 --> 09:10:52,110
Does it even exist?

7388
09:10:55,190 --> 09:10:57,030
We'll never know.

7389
09:11:03,800 --> 09:11:05,200
I wish we know.

7390
09:11:05,680 --> 09:11:07,120
I wish we know.

7391
09:11:10,000 --> 09:11:11,940
Oh my god, I can actually buy this.

7392
09:11:12,320 --> 09:11:12,860
Thank god.

7393
09:11:19,460 --> 09:11:20,800
Sorry, the needle smith.

7394
09:11:21,340 --> 09:11:21,620
Alright.

7395
09:11:23,520 --> 09:11:46,660
I don't, I really, really, okay, we'll fight, we'll end today's stream with a boss fight, and I rather fight, I rather fight, I'll fight this boss, I'll fight the skull tyrant, because I really, I really don't want to deal, go back to the poison area,

7396
09:11:47,040 --> 09:11:51,380
I, I, I don't think I'm strong enough anymore, I, I.

7397
09:11:54,760 --> 09:11:55,740
It's here.

7398
09:11:56,000 --> 09:11:57,000
I know it's here.

7399
09:11:58,220 --> 09:12:00,180
I'm not strong enough.

7400
09:12:03,560 --> 09:12:04,620
Oh yeah, six lives.

7401
09:12:04,760 --> 09:12:06,040
I am still three shot.

7402
09:12:13,640 --> 09:12:14,560
Which way is it?

7403
09:12:14,760 --> 09:12:15,540
Is it this way?

7404
09:12:15,880 --> 09:12:16,580
For the shortcut?

7405
09:12:17,320 --> 09:12:17,920
Right?

7406
09:12:18,740 --> 09:12:19,340
Yeah.

7407
09:12:21,940 --> 09:12:24,280
Oh, fucking course that gets me.

7408
09:12:27,280 --> 09:12:28,260
Wait, he doesn't like...

7409
09:12:29,020 --> 09:12:31,620
I'm gonna say, why didn't he ricochet there?

7410
09:12:34,880 --> 09:12:35,040
Okay.

7411
09:12:37,040 --> 09:12:37,500
Okay.

7412
09:12:41,700 --> 09:12:43,320
Oh my god, I didn't open the shortcut.

7413
09:12:43,600 --> 09:12:44,860
I did not open the shortcut.

7414
09:12:45,020 --> 09:12:45,680
Okay, that's fine.

7415
09:12:47,620 --> 09:12:48,420
That is fine.

7416
09:12:54,330 --> 09:12:55,330
That is fine.

7417
09:12:56,050 --> 09:12:57,850
I hate them, but that is okay.

7418
09:13:01,570 --> 09:13:02,030
Wee.

7419
09:13:06,310 --> 09:13:07,470
It's this way.

7420
09:13:08,250 --> 09:13:09,010
Oh, wait.

7421
09:13:09,870 --> 09:13:10,450
There you go.

7422
09:13:11,830 --> 09:13:13,450
I'll just really go back.

7423
09:13:17,150 --> 09:13:19,030
This is the boss I will fight.

7424
09:13:20,590 --> 09:13:22,210
Because I am done.

7425
09:13:25,590 --> 09:13:27,110
Are you okay?

7426
09:13:27,650 --> 09:13:28,270
That's okay.

7427
09:13:34,820 --> 09:13:35,660
This is evil.

7428

09:14:12,380 --> 09:14:13,420
Alright.

7434
09:14:15,160 --> 09:14:16,780

7435
09:14:17,460 --> 09:14:18,480
Before anything.

7436
09:14:19,320 --> 09:14:21,020
We will open the shortcut.

7437
09:14:22,440 --> 09:14:23,480

09:14:30,440 --> 09:14:31,560
I have to heal.

7440
09:14:32,740 --> 09:14:34,300

7452
09:15:16,400 --> 09:15:18,800
