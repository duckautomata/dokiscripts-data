1
00:03:42,300 --> 00:04:08,220
hello everybody hello hello oh my gosh finally we are here today to play sleeping dogs um basically it's like gta but um instead of la we're in hong kong so i've actually never played this game before um surprisingly um i did have a physical copy of it when it first came out um because you know I was like,

2
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:15,060
oh my God, um, um, you know, GTA Hong Kong, you know, I was like, oh my God, game based off of Hong Kong.

3
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,600
I was living in Hong Kong at that time as well.

4
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,120
So, um, I bought the game when it first came out.

5
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,420
Um, and then I try to play it.

6
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,580
Um, I try to play it by myself.

7
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,000
Like, uh, I don't remember, I think what console it was.

8
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:40,540
And for some reason, I stopped after 30 minutes because at I was like, single player is just not for me.

9
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,110
I was just like, it's not that fun playing single player games, you know?

10
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,950
Like, that was little me.

11
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,730
I was like, I was just like, oh, it's not that fun playing single player games by myself.

12
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,590
I guess I just, and then I just, I just like watching other people play.

13
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,110
Like, I just, I just remember that.

14
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,870
But now, now I'm okay.

15
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:46,770
Now, that's why, like, now on my YouTube channel, you see me play all these, like, games i never actually got a chance to play like all single player games because i am very like brain rotting when it came to comes to like multiplayer like i i just love multiplayer games when it comes to like um fps and shooters because like that's where like uh what gets me like super addicted um and like also like multiplayer in general is what gets me like super addicted to like video games um so but but when i stream these single player games i actually get to Enjoy them because I love I love streaming games in general like sharing like experiencing single-player games with you guys because it feels like multiplayer You know,

16
00:05:47,010 --> 00:06:04,810
it's like you're sharing the experience with a group of friends Like like a group here like you know, so That's why I love going through all these single-player campaigns and everything on stream Because if I get stuck, I can ask you guys for hope too If I don't know what I'm doing,

17
00:06:05,010 --> 00:07:04,790
I can be like what do I do so I can get backseated um so um I'm like one of those streamers I actually enjoy getting backseated instead of thinking for myself sometimes um when you guys said mute the music due to DMCA the most they do is just they they claim the video and then get my five like one like i don't know one percent of the ad revenue which i mean they get they get the ad revenue which is like what one dollar which is fine i don't need any of the music because um music claims is mostly just they they just take my ad revenue for the stream so like i'm fine with that i don't really care so yeah like this is technically my first time playing it blind um so um i've only I don't even remember the first 30 minutes of the game,

18
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,490
to be honest.

19
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,730
So it is going to be a blind reaction to the sleeping dogs.

20
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,570
Oh, Mushy, thank you for the super chat.

21
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:12,850
Thank you.

22
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,330
Thank you.

23
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,650
Add your revenue.

24
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,850
Thank you for the super chat.

25
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,110
Thank you.

26
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,430
Thank you.

27
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,710
What I'm hoping for is that it's multiple music companies taking, claiming the ad revenue.

28
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,150
So they'll split the money.

29
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,610
They'll split that $1 to like five different companies.

30
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,450
So I hope that that's what happens.

31
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,330
So like they basically get nothing.

32
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:46,770
One George, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, here is five dollars, yeah, yeah, make them fight for the dollar, that's why whenever I do like, like, study streams or member streams, and I just don't care, like, I was like, oh, I'm gonna get,

33
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:59,450
like, if I'm just like, oh, I'm gonna get copyright claimed anyway, like, if I'm gonna get, like, copyright claimed, um, anyways, to, for my ad revenue, I'll just play, like, all the company music, like, I'll play, like, Disney instrumental, Nintendo instrumental,

34
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,870
like, I'll just, like, just fight for it, I don't care.

35
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,850
Like, just fight for this one fucking dollar.

36
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,090
So none of you actually get anything.

37
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,490
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

38
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,570
Thank you, thank you.

39
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,130
Hey, Doki, my retro plush came in today.

40
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,370
Too bad, not home to get it.

41
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:17,970
So sad.

42
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,870
At least it's here.

43
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,270
Woo.

44
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,210
All the merch is arriving so fast.

45
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,190
Yeah, I'm happy about that.

46
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,210
Also, do I play this on controller or mouse and keyboard chat?

47
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:38,730
I was reading chat and people were like oh, yeah, like the gunplay for this is not like that good Like mostly people would just this fight.

48
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,270
Oh controller.

49
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:39,530
Okay.

50
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:52,410
I'll plug in my controller Because I wasn't sure if I'm playing if I should be playing controller or not because I was like well I would like to shoot my gun properly because I I cannot I honestly I'm I cannot aim my controller when it comes to like Shooting stuff.

51
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,890
So I just I just never really grew up with that.

52
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:32,790
So I'm just like it's just it's just very sad watching me try to aim in that silk song finally got announced i was not expecting it to come out in two weeks like i you know when you know when they're like supposed to announce a release date you would have like a couple of months to like get ready for the new game the fact that it comes out in two weeks is crazy like i thought i had enough time to like complete hollow night before before silk i mean Okay,

53
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:41,030
so next week, there's going to be a lot of Hollow Knight, because I'm going to try and complete Hollow Knight before we get into Silk Song.

54
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:57,550
The fact that it's like, two, it is, it is, the fact that everyone waited, like, how many years for Silk Song, and it feels like they just dropped it, like, I feel like they were, you know, they're like, we don't need enough average, we don't need more advertising or hype to hype it up.

55
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,230
Like, two weeks is good enough.

56
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:41,530
drop more trailers of silk song before it get and like tease it a little bit more before we get to like the actual drop but the fact that it's coming out in two weeks oh my gosh okay so like i promise i did promise you guys i would finish hollow night before we played silk song so next week we're gonna have like i don't know three to four streams of hollow night and see how it goes We'll see how much I can complete in three to four streams Because I do want to At least like I'll be warmed up You know I'll be I'll be warmed up for Silk Song Before it drops

57
00:10:47,060 --> 00:11:07,180
This is what happens When you procrastinate with your homework Thank you for the super chat I can't believe Silk Song is real Oh my god I was not expecting that So next week, it's going to be lots of holiday.

58
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,980
So, but yeah, that's going to be next week's schedule.

59
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,940
Other than, but yeah, yesterday, I didn't stream yesterday because when I did the Mage Arena stream, I was coughing a lot.

60
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,320
I was coughing in bed too, when I was like, I was trying to sleep and I kept coughing myself awake.

61
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,880
And yesterday morning.

62
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,960
So I was like, I can't.

63
00:11:30,180 --> 00:12:24,180
like rest my voice uh before then because i'm still a little at the aftermath of my sick of my um of my cold i guess so it's just i'm just coughing i'm better technically i'm okay i'm just coughing that's really it like it's just me expelling the leftover bacteria um so sorry for no no club penguin yesterday um we'll see how i'm not sure if i'll do club penguin next like i said i was gonna postpone it for next week but i'm like there's so much hollow that i have to do so i don't know i don't know if we have time for club penguin next week we'll see i still have time to figure this out we'll see um other than that uh the other thing i want to talk about was victory bell because what the okay i when i saw the picture of victory bell i was like what the

64
00:12:29,840 --> 00:13:22,720
like um i don't know it's so the the trail i don't know you guys know this but everyone thought pokemon posted the wrong screenshot for their pokemon director something and they're like what the because it looked like a horror film um because they're like why is this a horror film screenshot on their pokemon twitter uh and and and then they did a parody they basically did like a horror movie parody where it was like um like a youtube parody where uh like a bunch of kids were exploring uh like an abandoned building and they were like trying to like figure out where like oh what ghost pokemon is and it was just victory bell but like for those who don't follow on pokemon this is the new mega evolution uh victory bell and uh so cody thank you for the mega uh sorry

Super, thank you, thank you, thank you.

74
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,400
At least it doesn't look as stupid as the Dragon Knight one.

75
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,440
I'm sorry.

76
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,520
Like, I don't know if this is a hot take.

77
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:44,440
But the dragonite one, he looks so fucking stupid like I'm I am not in I was not impressed when they did the the mega no, it's just okay Okay, let's see for those who never saw but at least we're talking about it.

78
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:53,120
I guess it's just I don't know They're just Take that back.

79
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:21,160
I It's just fucking weird I feel like because Dragon Knight is such a fan favorite I feel like they could have I don't know it's just there's something wrong there's a what do you mean it's literally it's just I there's just something wrong okay like there's something wrong with it

80
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,700
I feel like he deserved better.

81
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,240
That's all I feel.

82
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,960
I feel like he deserved better.

83
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,460
At least the Mega Victory Bell looks better than Mega Dragon Knight.

84
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,720
Anyway, let's play Sleeping Dogs.

85
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,460
Wolf, wolf.

86
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,540
Alright, let me make sure that...

87
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,840
It just looks very silly, okay?

88
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,440
It just looks very silly.

89
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,220
Because if you look at, like...

90
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,520
I feel like the...

91
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:27,180
original the first mega evolutions they all looked very badass if you think about it the the first couple of mega evolution that they first came up they look incredibly badass because it's like mega evolution like fucking charizard got like you look silly like like you know mega charizard the mega charizard x and y they look like edgy as hell and like look really badass so i just i Um,

92
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,720
how silly Mega Dragonite or Mega...

93
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,480
What the fuck is Mega Audino?

94
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,680
Okay, let me look at Mega Audino.

95
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,580
I don't even remember what the fuck Audino is.

96
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,860
Mega Audino.

97
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,940
Did I got a Mega Evolution?

98
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,800
What the fuck?

99
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,740
Which...

100
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,940
Some head dev really...

101
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,520
This is a head dev.

102
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,720
Dev's like favorite fucking Pokemon right there.

103
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:06,060
Yeah, I was gonna be like, like, okay, but like you can't really make Ardino badass, not gonna lie.

104
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,080
That is somebody's Nepo baby right there.

105
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,020
Like what the fuck?

106
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,020
Who?

107
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,240
Who?

108
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,680
Who is it?

109
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,560
That is definitely some head Dev's like favorite Pokemon.

110
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,180
And they're like, but sir, what a...

111
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,480
But, sir, what about the other starters?

112
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,420
Like, no!

113
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,820
Milo Dino must be, must get a mega evolution.

114
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,060
Doki's just hating.

115
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,140
That's not true.

116
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,540
Someone's like, no, Charizard's the Nepo baby.

117
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,620
Charizard is everybody's Nepo baby, okay?

118
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,920
He's been a Nepo baby since he was fucking born.

119
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,900
Dev's Nepo baby.

120
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,240
You know, it's just one guy's baby.

121
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,960
Literally one person.

122
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,100
Charizard is an OG.

123
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,640
He deserved it.

124
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,500
He clawed his way into success.

125
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,680
No more electric rats.

126
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,380
All right.

127
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,980
He deserved it.

128
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,200
He is OG.

129
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,760
He is literally the president's son.

130
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,300
Charizard is all of our Nepo babies.

131
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,220
Who the fuck is on Dino's Netbo baby?

132
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,240
Alright, let's go.

133
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,200
Uh, let's play the main story.

134
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,560
Start a new game.

135
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,060
Hey, you're so tired of that lizard.

136
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,820
Seems like somebody got fucking shit on by the Netbo baby.

137
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,000
Uh, Therans, thank you for the super chat.

138
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,820
Thank you, thank you.

139
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,960
Fight back to school is a good movie.

140
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,380
It is.

141
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,480
It's one of my favorite Steven Child movies.

142
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,500
I've got it.

143
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,920
I've got it.

144
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,400
What?

145
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,600
How much money?

146
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,220
Oh, it's all in Cantonese.

147
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Nice.

148
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,460
Okay, the subtitle is tiny as fuck.

149
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,360
I'm sorry, guys.

150
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,000
He's only... I'm not fucking blind.

151
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,360
Relax, old boy.

152
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,540
The one, the one guy that's...

153
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,160
That speaks English.

154
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,960
It's like a Russian... You know, like, like, you know how like they do like, oh, a Russian movie or like, and then they all speak English?

155
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,380
It's like, this takes place in Russia and then they all speak English.

156
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,300
Oh, that's true.

157
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:39,900
It's Hong Kong.

158
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,160
Everybody speaks English.

159
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,000
No, we speak, we speak like Canton English.

160
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,360
English knees.

161
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,340
English knees.

162
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
Yeah, Russian with British accents.

163
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,260
Come, come, my friend.

164
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,060
Are you crazy?

165
00:20:59,340 --> 00:20:59,740
No, don't.

166
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,860
Maybe we can sort something out, huh?

167
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,920
Yeah, do you know who I...

168
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,080
Oh, shit!

169
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,520
He's like, did you know who I am?

170
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,660
And then he gets shamed.

171
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,420
Oh, bro!

172
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,520
With a butcher knife?

173
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,900
Oh my god!

174
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,020
That shit is crazy.

175
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,920
We'll never know who he is.

176
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,380
That's true.

177
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,740
Who was he?

178
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,840
What the meat cleaver?

179
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,120
Where I see that?

180
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,760
Okay, follow Nans.

181
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
I got you now.

182
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,260
Oh, shit.

183
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,140
Wait, no, never mind.

184
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,540
I forgot how to sprint, apparently.

185
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,860
Alright.

186
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm trying my best!

187
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,760
Oh, my God.

188
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,700
Do I hold it?

189
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,860
Okay, I can hold.

190
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,240
Alright.

191
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,860
Don't worry, I got you.

192
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm going the fastest I can!

193
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,600
Stop him!

194
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,900
Please, he's a criminal!

195
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,920
Okay.

196
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,940
Yeah, I'm the Hong Kong police.

197
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
Get over here.

198
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,440
That's fucking right.

199
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,080
Respect my authority.

200
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,900
I won't go to Casa Bonita.

201
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,420
Oh shit!

202
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,220
I'm sorry, I was looking at Casa Bonita yesterday.

203
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,420
Do you know they have like a waitlist?

204
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,780
Right now for like Casapunita.

205
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,360
Oh my god, I'm sorry guys.

206
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:33,960
I'll pay for it.

207
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,580
I swear to God with my very, very high police salary.

208
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,700
Wait, I thought I was a good guy.

209
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,200
Wait, what?

210
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,220
I wasn't?

211
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,720
Oh shit, no, I was doing a drug deal.

212
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,440
Yeah, I was...

213
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,040
He's basically giving him his rights.

214
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,320
I did it.

215
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,500
I thought he was an undercover cop.

216
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,960
Yes, he there you go.

217
00:23:33,300 --> 00:24:01,980

They finally deport your ass from the United States?

219
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,460
That was mutual.

220
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,580
Time I came home anyway.

221
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,280
Oh, that's why I speak mostly English.

222
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,120
Home, sweet home.

223
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,760

00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,180
Okay.

225
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,980
Nothing that'll stick.

226
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,920
Well, don't let them pin any extra shit on you.

227
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,080
Emma Stone's in here?

228
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,080
Let me tell you.

229
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,840
Once they hear you're from old prosperity, happens all the time.

230
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,320
Hey, so you still in touch with any of the guys from there?

231
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,420
A few, you know.

232
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,400
Well, that's why I speak mostly English.

233
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,760
He's from the United States.

234
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,700
He's moved all the way up to Red Pole and the Sun on Yee.

235
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,260
I've got a couple of things going with him right now, matter of fact.

236
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:37,700
Huh.

237
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,840
Red Pole and the Sun on Yee.

238
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,020
Shit.

239
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,920
Dog Guys always said he'd be running that neighborhood.

240
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,280
Oh, Dog Guys is a Red Pole too.

241
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,300
It's still a total poke guy.

242
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,900
Ha ha ha ha.

243
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,840
Okay, I'll say poke guy is worse than asshole.

244
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,900
It's a lot worse than hassle.

245
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,540
It's a very bad word.

246
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,460
It's a very bad word.

247
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,440
Wade fucking Shen in the flesh.

248
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,780
I can't believe it.

249
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,180
Jackie.

250
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,780
Looks like I'm out of here.

251
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,660
Hey, Jackie.

252
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,300
So look, if you and Winston ever need help with any of that shit you got going on with him.

253
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,100
Of course, man.

254
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,000
Look me up when you get out.

255
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,620
Just be like old times.

256
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,100
Nice.

257
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,900
Yay, Jackie's freed.

258
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,340
What does it mean?

259
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,320
It's like the Mel equivalent of the C word.

260
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,900
Like, if I ever...

261
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,660
If I say that in front of my parents, I'd get slapped.

262
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,280
It seems that the evidence against you is failed to appear.

263
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,160
How do you explain that?

264
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,480
You must be a very dangerous man, Wei Shen.

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,770
Do they have internet in America?

269
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,450
I think they're getting it next year.

270
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,490
I guess you were in prison or something.

271
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,170
Come on, let's get out of here.

272
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,470
Still getting used to being back, huh?

273

I was not expecting that for the settings.

276
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,690
All right, options, audio, sound effects.

277
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,170

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,750
He's like, you're crazy.

282
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,750
I was like, how is he crazy?

283
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,310
That's right.

284
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,950
I'll never do that, Jackie.

285
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,450
I ain't no NARC.

286
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,670
Anyway, how old are you?

287
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,510
Like, can I have your first, middle, and last name plus your maiden's name?

288
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,630
You just don't even know me.

289
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,130
Once we get to know each other, they'll love me.

290
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,070
Okay,

291
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,710
the subtitle is like not that accurate.

292
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,530
That's right.

293
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,910
Oh, shit.

294
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:21,370
Okay.

295
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,190
Don't worry.

296
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,310
I got you.

297
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,190
I got you.

298
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,330
I can press X.

299
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:28,870
Let's go.

300
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,490
Okay.

301
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,150
One, two, and then one.

00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:42,110
One, oh my god, one, two, hold, one, two, hold, one, two, oh my god, I'm fucking it up.

303
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,190
I'm fucking up the most, it's just all X's and I still managed to fuck it up.

304
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:47,870
Okay.

305
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,010
I'm playing Tekken right now.

306
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,530
I'm sorry!

307
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,250
I'm sorry, I'm just spamming X's.

308
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,410
You kidding me?

309
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,310
Yeah, all right.

310
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:05,910
Come the fuck.

311
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,770
Yeah, come on.

312
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,610
Whoa, whoa.

313
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,290
That's right.

314
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,250
Who taught you how to say that?

315
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,890
What will your parents say?

316
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,190
Wait, I can sprint.

317
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,410
Oh, shit.

318
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,090
Oh, my God.

319
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:24,990
I'm going to do that again.

320
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,190
That's right.

321
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,810
Say hello to that wall.

322
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,830
That's right.

323
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,090
Hey, say hello to this wall, too.

324
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,730
That's right.

325
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,130
I'm going to take you to all the doors.

326
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,430
That's looking right.

327
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:35,130
Boom.

328
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,090
That's right.

329
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,190
That door's made a seal.

330
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,530
I want to take your shoes too.

331
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,510
I don't know if...

332
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,810
Hit it, run.

333
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,410
Boom.

334
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,330
Knock, knock.

335
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,510
That's right.

336
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,390
Knock, knock.

337
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,550
I don't know if this does any damage at all.

338
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,650
Get grappled.

339
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,850
Get over here.

340
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:00,970
That's all.

341
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,490
Take you to the other side.

342
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:03,910
That's right.

343
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,090
You think only that door is safe?

344
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,870
No.

345
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,790
No doors are safe.

346
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,910
That's right.

347
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,930
Knock, knock.

348
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:16,850
Boom.

349
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,790
Oh, sorry.

350
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,130
I had to do that one first before.

351
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:25,630
All right.

352
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,450
All right.

353
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,150
Wrong door.

354
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,430
I was supposed to take you over here.

355
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,490

I ran over people with my grapple.

365
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,310
Seems to me you could use some better help.

366
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,410
Wait, come on, yeah, huh?

367
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,650

369
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,510
But he actually said, what are you saying?

00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,070
Dang, Yat-san, I do remember you.

371
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,110

372
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,430

Me, me, me, Shand.

375

I remember her.

376
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:16,370
It was like, was she hot?

377
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,250
I was with all guys.

378
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,690
No offense.

379
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:19,790
Don't know.

380
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,030
So, Topalga.

381
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:21,930
Oh.

382
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,430
Where is she now?

383
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,990
She dead?

384
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,010
Oh, shit.

385
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,210
Oh, my God.

386
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:31,170
Sorry.

387
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,090
Oh, you see her.

388
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,910
So, oh, my God.

389
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,750
She is dead.

390
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:37,390
Guys, huh?

391
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,610
That's why he hates the triads, because she got close to the triads.

392
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,950
Uh-huh.

393
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,550
We'll see.

394
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,610
Convoy.

395
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:54,270
You know that problem we got in the market, why don't you take away with you?

396
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,390
So there's still a chance, like, where is she buried?

397
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,170
Hey, Jackie, hang back a second.

398
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,010
I want to hear more about your friend.

399
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,410
But is she still hot?

400
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,590
You want to be a tough guy?

401
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,710
Let's see if you can handle yourself.

402
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,570
Dude, see what he's got.

403
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,510
Great.

404
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,310
That's all I fucking need.

405
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:19,750
All right.

406
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,590
Oh, yeah?

407
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,410
Oh, counter.

408
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,290
Oh, shit.

409
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:25,690
Yeah, you like that?

410
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,150
Yeah?

411
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,110
I could do it again.

412
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,190
Yeah, you'll do it again?

413
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,290
Man, that's okay, right?

414
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,290
Get countered.

415
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,750
Survive the hazing?

416
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,210
Oh, I just have to keep...

417
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,510
Wait, why won't you let me grapple?

418
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,530
God, that's fucking right.

419
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,370
Yeah, that's right.

420
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,570
I'll do a dick punch if I have to.

421
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,370
Do it again.

422
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,010
That's fucking right.

423
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,630
Do that again.

424
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,750
Survive for 28 seconds.

425
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:51,430
Oh, wow.

426
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,690
Guys, it's so difficult, guys.

427
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,790
You think they're going to try and punch me again?

428
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,210
Oh, my God.

429
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,610
What will they do?

430
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,170
It's like...

431
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:04,850
Damn.

432
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,310
I'm going to try that again.

433
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,150
I'm going to try that again.

434
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,550
Yeah, that's okay, right.

435
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,710
Keep doing that.

436
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,590
The most difficult game of my life.

437
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,550
It's like yellow paint, but red outline.

438
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,530
Like how the trans...

439
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,190
The substance is like, what the fuck are you doing?

440
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,650
But he literally was just saying, what are you doing?

441
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,150
Winston, my old friend, so good to see you.

442
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,750
The Eldrinko got nothing on me.

443
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,850
Oh, Winston.

444
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,590
Wait, wait, wait.

445
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,510
But yeah, don't keep bringing him to his Cantonese.

446
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,630
Oh, that's so good.

447
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,690
That's so good.

448
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,790
We can share the night market, huh?

449
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,390
We're both Songong Yi.

450
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,310
Both grown men.

451
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,670
We shouldn't be fighting like children.

452
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,510
Get on your Cantonese.

453
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,270
Hey, who's the new blood?

454
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,170
It's Wei.

455
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,490
I'm from America.

456
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,030
Back when you first started getting girls with big smiley.

457
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,390
Oh, Mimi.

458
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,410
Oh, that's...

459
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,210
Oh, that's awkward.

460
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,310
Ways are brother.

461
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,650
And I was the first guy who ever stabbed me.

462
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

463
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,750
Wait, what the fuck, man?

Yeah, she had a bad choice of men, clearly.

469
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,910
You guys see who are in the warehouse.

470
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,170

00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,110
Like she was in the wrong crowd with the triads.

00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,830
Paxton punch and crease her melee.

Oh, it's only for $30 Hong Kong dollars.

479

That's like five American dollars.

480
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,850
Not bad.

481
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,510

What's the word?

489
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,880
This is like very nostalgic for me.

519
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,210
We're collecting for Winston.

520
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:09,910
Winston?

521
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,190
Don't I said he's in trust here.

522
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,610
We're here to clarify that.

523

You're not?

527
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,530
That's it.

528
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,690
Get over here.

529
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,950
Oh, that's your son?

530
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,190
That's fucking right.

531
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,950
Get in this phone booth.

532
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,870
Someone call the police, but not for me.

533
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,810
That's right.

534
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,790
Now you have to pay for your son's medical bills.

535
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,350
Now get me a Bolex watch!

536
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,290
I'm glad I can make you see reason.

537
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,990
Collect the call.

538
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:49,450
Nice.

539
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,030
Violent actions against...

540
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,150
I like how nobody cared.

541
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:53,870
They all know.

542
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:54,530
That's right.

543
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,050
They all fucking know.

544
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,350
That's right.

545
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:57,490
Oh.

546
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,110
Did I kill him?

547
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,610
Did I?

548
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,470
There's no.

549
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,350
No, he's breathing.

550
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,330
You know?

551
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,270
Just barely.

552
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,280
Oh, whoops.

553
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:11,960
What?

554
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,620
Yeah, say that to my face.

555
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,560
That's right.

556
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,640
Walk away, bitch.

557
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,780
That's fucking right.

558
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,420
I went to America.

559
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,020
I see shit.

560
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,060
Wait, there's a health shrine?

561
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,040
Duki, I don't think he's moving.

562
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,720
Wait, there's a health shrine here?

563
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,440
You're getting too far from Jackie.

564
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,360
That's right.

565
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,800
Don't even look at my face.

566
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,800
That's looking right.

567
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,360
This ain't no British colony right now.

568
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,820
We were...

569
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,840
We Americans rebelled against the British colony.

570
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,360
Okay.

571
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:52,600
Alright.

572
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,840
Give me the money.

573
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,520
We should have never killed anyone.

574
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,560
Josh, thank you for the super chat.

575
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,000
Thank you.

576
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:01,800
Thank you.

577
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,140
Everyone has business with Winston.

578
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,120
You're gonna pay up.

579
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,700
You understand?

580
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,500
Go tell Winston to stick a back toy up his ass.

581
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,680
What did you fucking say?

582
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,280
Alright, where is he?

583
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,660
That's right!

584
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,280
Get over here!

585
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,380
Get your fucking get in the box!

586
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,600
That's right!

587
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,220
Okay.

588
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,160
No, you ain't.

589
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,340
Give me a sec, guys.

590
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,900
I'm heading into the other box.

591
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,220
You think your punches will get me?

592
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,640
That's right.

593
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,780
Someone packed up.

594
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,840
It's moving day.

595
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,740
Oh, I'm fucking heading over to your bok choy now.

596
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,780
Give me a sec.

597
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,420
I'm going to the wall next to your bok choy.

598
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,020
That's fucking right.

599
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,760
That's fucking right.

600
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,740
You think I care?

601
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,640
I can take those hits.

602
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,900
That's fucking right.

603
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,060
Get over here.

604
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,880
Wait, there's a shutter?

605
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:55,900
Where's the...

606
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,280
Oh, I'm gonna cut you in half, little boy.

607
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,920
Oh, never mind.

608
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,140
We'll put you in the pineapple then.

609
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,140
Oh, there's a...

610
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,880
There's apparently a red shrine somewhere.

611
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,960
Where is that?

612
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:12,780
Give me a...

613
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,620
Oh, I'm getting too far.

614
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,540
God damn it, Jackie.

615
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,260
I need to go to my rich ride.

616
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,800
Oh, shit.

617
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,040
That's right.

618
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:20,920
Wait.

619
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,540
Wait, I could take her.

620
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:23,940
All right, get over here.

621
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,960
I need to use the shutter.

622
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,860
Give me a sec.

623
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,540
There's an environment right there.

624
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,200
That's what you're...

625
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:29,980
Get over here.

626
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,980
There you go.

627
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,460
There you go.

628
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,640
That's fucking right.

629
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,800
Get out of here.

630
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,880
I have three strikes.

631
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,100
It's okay.

632
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,060
As long as I don't... As long as I don't do the third strike.

633
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,860
You saw that?

634
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,820
She wasn't even part of it.

635
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,320
You fucking saw that?

636
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,920
She tried to sell me Red Bull.

637
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,360
That's fucking right.

638
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,480
You saw Dog Eyes do that before?

639
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,400
You didn't.

640
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,040
Isn't that?

641
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,920
She's fine.

642
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,600
She'll just drink some Red Bull later.

643
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,400
Oh, isn't that?

644
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:09,800
Is that the...

645
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,580
the rich ride?

646
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,260
Oh, it is.

647
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,480
It's fine, right?

648
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,260
No!

649
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:25,080
It's fine.

650
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,980
I... Like, technically I didn't kill anyone.

651
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,040
No, that's why I'm such a neem, I can mention.

652
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,840
Never stick you with a super chat.

653
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,100
Thank you, thank you.

654
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,720
Oh, point point!

655
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,060
Oh my god, you heard that?

656
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,820
No pork about pork fan.

657
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,900
You're not a whole man.

658
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,420
You're right.

659
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,840
You're so right.

660
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,140
And I get rewarded with some pork buns.

661
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,240
Let's go.

662
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,960
He said nothing.

663
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,240
Let's go.

664
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,440
Can I just grab this guy?

665
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:17,900
Whoa, hey, what's going on here?

666
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,420
Only I can, that's right, get in this vending machine.

667
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,000
Oh my God, get over here.

668
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,700
Oh, shit, you thought you could do that?

669
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,400
Get your ass over here.

670
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,480
That's fucking right.

671
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,310
Oh my God, you think I didn't see you?

672
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,010
All right, get over here.

673
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,770
I have another environment to pick you in.

674
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,950
And man, that's fucking right.

675
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,110
Oh, you see that?

00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,490
I thought, why not?

822
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,610
I'll take a nice little cut for my boys.

823
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:54,030
If I do all of this, that means technically I could legally murder someone because I'm an undercover cop.

824
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,250
And they were like, why did you do it?

825
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,150
And I was like, I had to make sure I played my part.

He was there.

831
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,970
He was part of the secret files in the triads.

832
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:22,950
That's Kwan for Ming's...

833
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:23,930

The triads told me to do it.

839
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,930
And if I didn't, they would know I was a cop.

840
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,710
Oh my god, you're having a fight.

841
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,010
He doesn't respect her with the waiters.

842
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,630
He doesn't respect them.

843
00:56:58,730 --> 00:56:59,650
Oh my god, it's Dim Sum!

844
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,250

849
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,130
Okay, I go downstairs.

You have quite a rap sheet here.

And now you're here enforcing for the sun on ye.

A flashing thing.

1005
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,060

01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,040
Oh, wait, it is flashing.

1008
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:40,940
Wait, you're right.

Wait, why is it flashing?

01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,380
Is that an item?

1011
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,780

01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,300

Oh my god, wait.

1015
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,280
Why was it for the massage?

1016
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,540
Guys, see?

1017
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,160
Everything always.

1018
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,780
You got $50,000.

1019
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,240
I told you.

1020
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,320
I told you guys it was an investment.

1021
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,440
I told you.

1022
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:16,260
I can get so many massages now.

1023
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,560
Gonna get it.

1024
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,640
That was a very.

1025
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,040
happy ending.

1026
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,700
That was a very, very happy ending.

1027
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,940
I told you it was worth it and you guys didn't believe me.

1028
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:40,720
Hey, mister.

1029
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,140
You got a moment?

1030
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,260
Do you think this shirt is too tight?

1031
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,260
Whoa.

1032
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,560
Wait, was that, is that it?

1033
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,680
Wait, what?

1034
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:52,880
I will teach you to be a friend.

1035
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,140
Oh, my buddy!

1036
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,080
Wait, oh, yeah, it's just $500.

1037
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,760
Oh, okay, that's fine.

1038
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,740
He cashed a peep and teach him a...

1039
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,880
Okay, to be fair, it's only...

1040
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,560
Like, it's $500 from my $50k.

1041
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,000
Like, do I really care?

1042
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,740
Like, I really care about that.

1043
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,780
You know, I had $50k in my pocket and he only took $500.

1044
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,960
That's... That's on him.

1045
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,000
I...

1046
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,640
All of these...

1047
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:26,920
Oh, he doesn't know who I am.

1048
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,880
Say hello to my little friend.

1049
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,120
The wall.

1050
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,100
You know, I heard they're gonna build a wall.

1051
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:41,600
Alright.

1052
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,520
$500 is $500.

1053
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,060
Nice.

1054
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,280
My face experience.

1055
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,260
And I got my $500 back.

1056
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,320
The wall slammer.

1057
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,920
You know, they did tell me about the Great Wall of China.

1058
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,860
I don't think this is what the- this is the wall they're talking about, though.

1059
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:10,260
Oh, there's another- there's another massage parlor.

1060
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,740
Gosh, my bones are- all my bones are aching right now.

1061
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,140
Alright, let's go.

1062
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:28,500
Let's go.

1063
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,160
Where is it?

1064
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,960
It's over here.

1065
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,300
What a day.

1066
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,700
All right, it should be like, where is she?

1067
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,220
Where's my...

1068
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,480
Oh, there she is.

1069
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,220
Hello.

1070
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:44,760
Hello.

1071
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:45,260
Hello.

1072
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,320
Oh, yeah.

1073
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,840
I mean, who could resist you?

1074
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:53,680
I know, right?

1075
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:53,720
I mean, who could resist you?

1076
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:53,980
I know, right?

1077
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,780
Good investment.

1078
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:56,880
I promise.

1079
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,420
No regrets here.

1080
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,240
I almost got robbed.

1081
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,540
Like, time for a massage.

1082
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,260
Where do I actually have to go?

1083
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:16,300
Okay.

1084
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,720
Stick up and delivery.

1085
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:23,800
What's the difference between stick up and delivery in the case file?

1086
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,920
know where my bike is.

1087
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:26,380
Fuck.

1088
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,120
Oh, pay hospital bills.

1089
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,180
Uh, fuck it.

1090
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:30,980
I have 50k.

1091
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:31,920
It doesn't really matter.

1092
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,040
I'm gonna steal a car.

1093
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,440
I don't know where my bike is.

1094
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:35,600
All right.

1095
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,440
It's time for the GTA part.

1096
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,500
On the GTA.

1097
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,340
It's okay.

1098
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:46,620
It's okay.

1099
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:47,780
I'll be fine.

1100
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,760
It's time to borrow a car.

1101
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:53,720
I'm a cop.

1102
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,640
Give me your car.

1103
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,300

Okay, how do I get up there?

1116
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,260

Never mind.

1175
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:52,240
This car was much more built than I expected it to be.

1176
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,880
Oh my god, never mind, Calvin.

1177

Apparently I had a six-pack under the engine.

1179
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:05,820

01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,240
Get over here.

1190
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:29,240
Get over here.

1191
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:33,680
Get your ass.

1192
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,240
Oh, shit.

1193
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:36,100
He's fucking...

1194
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:36,780
What the fuck?

1195
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,700
He has a gun?

1196
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,520
Oh, my God.

1197
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,440
I was not expecting the gun.

1198
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,080
The battle box.

1199
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,860
Yeah, it's battle cars right now.

1200
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,880
I did not expect a gun.

1201
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,560
I did not expect you to pull out a gun on me.

1202
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,320
He's got a gun.

1203
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:53,680
I need to hit a cop.

1204
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:54,560
I know who to call.

1205
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,420
That's why you're pulled over.

1206
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:57,940
Alright.

1207
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,320
Yeah.

1208
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,740
Alright, Calvin.

1209
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,380
Goodbye.

1210
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,560
The cops have guns.

1211
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,540
Can I still ram?

1212
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:15,840
Oh, I can.

1213
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:16,240
Okay.

1214
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,240
Oh!

1215
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,120
He's okay.

1216
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,860
I don't have a strike.

1217
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:23,860
So I technically I didn't kill anybody.

1218
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:25,980
Okay, it's this way.

1219
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:29,320
God, the sensitivity is so...

1220
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,700
It's so...

1221
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,180
Guys, I didn't get a...

1222
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:34,900
I didn't get minus one police badge, so he's alive.

1223
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,680
Never killed anyone, by the way.

1224
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:39,860
But it's this way.

1225
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:40,220
Whoops.

1226
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,720
It's this way.

1227
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,800
The car killed him, not me, guys.

1228
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,460
It's the car company's fault.

1229
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,040
Not me.

1230
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,680
It's like the thing about...

1231
01:21:52,700 --> 01:22:18,340
like tesla cars if like the auto driver killed someone if the car the auto driver killed someone like is it really the driver's fault or the car's fault i had auto drive on guys i have autopilot on different you don't know that

1232
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:26,420
Boom!

1233
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,180
Oh, Nimi, thank you for the raid!

1234
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,540
Thank you, thank you.

1235
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,280
I've had a great stream!

1236
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,860
All right, I wasn't committing any murder.

1237
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,920
I'm just... I'm just larping right now.

1238
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:41,380
Don't worry, I'm a cop.

1239
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,160
What are you doing here?

1240
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,120
I'm sure you and Pendu have a lot of top-secret backdoor business to attend to.

1241
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,000
I'm sorry about how I acted in there.

1242
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,560
Yeah, I'm just larping.

1243
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:56,960
I have to be convincing.

1244
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,720
I'll see what I can dig up.

1245
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,280
How's that for an olive breast?

1246
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:01,820
Be serious.

1247
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:02,940
Just like that.

1248
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,340
I'll help where I can.

1249
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:07,940
I'm just a little shocked.

1250
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,420
I'm just used to Pinterest people being more like him.

1251
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,800
I just think we'd be better off helping each other.

1252
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:13,940
Come on, what do you say?

1253
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:18,840
Oh my god, wait, he has a tattoo of fucking Guan Yun on his shoulder.

1254
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:19,920
Wait, that's hardcore.

1255
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:23,420

Okay, never mind.

Apparently I don't have this number.

1271
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,820

Kale Yudan is so good.

1298
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,500
Curry fish balls is iconic.

An iconic Hong Kong cuisine right there.

01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:27,700

1309
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,980
Yeah, it's from Jackie.

1310
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,500
Chan Adventures, which, by the way, is not even voiced by Jackie Chan.

1311
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:47,480
Like, I thought, like, I don't know, that actually, like, ruined my childhood a little bit when I found out Jackie Chan doesn't even fucking voice act himself in Jackie Chan Adventures.

1312
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,440
Wait, you okay, man?

1313
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:52,820
It's some random guy.

1314
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,220
Jackie, I'm just a little frustrated, stuck being Winston Zarenborg.

1315
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,800
You know, I was making serious bank back in the States.

1316
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:29,640
on we're just paying our dues winston's a loyal guy he'll hook us up when the time's right you can't always wait for the world to hand you what you want sometimes he ain't got time for me as a child it's time to take a little initiative we gotta prove ourselves to winston and the sun on ye or we'll never move up to be fair you didn't have time for it he was i should say that yeah there is dog eyes has a big shipment of stolen goods coming in it's good for dog eyes but that might be too much or too fast.

1317
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:33,280
The last thing I need right now is taking a sticky red pull up my ass.

1318
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:34,080
It's not like that.

1319
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:35,180
It's a small deal.

1320
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,580
Word is, there's only a few low-level lunge.

1321
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,760
You're looking after it.

1322
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:41,640
We boost that shit and give Winston a nice fat cut.

1323
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:43,680
He's gonna be mad impressed.

1324
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,220
No way he doesn't promote us after that.

1325
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:49,100
We'd have to be certain it couldn't be traced back to Winston or us.

1326
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,040
Yeah, we gotta make it clean, Jackie.

1327
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,680
Unless we get caught.

1328
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,980
Well, we won't unless you fuck it up.

I heard you were electrifying.

1337
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,660
I don't think there's any more walls.

1338
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,160
Oh, wait.

1339
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:56,120

01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:17,660
I need to find, like, more environments.

Is there any more?

1346
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:21,820
No more.

1347
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:22,780
Oh, wait.

1348
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,560
Jackie, why are you just there?

1349
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:26,180

01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:31,480
Oh my god, help the brother out!

Hey buddy, you want to see the Great Wall of China?

1352
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:50,650
All right, let's put him on against the wall.

1353
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:52,230
He's in the zone.

1354

Okay, these guys, okay, this one, I...

1355

01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:01,250
How you like that?

1357
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:05,250
Jackie, you can't fucking say that shit when you're just in the car, Jackie.

1358
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:06,150
Wait.

1359
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:11,430
Jackie, you're not helping.

1360
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:15,330
There's my collection.

1361
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:17,530
All right, it's fine.

1362
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:20,290
There we go.

1363
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:21,690
Do you it?

1364
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:26,210
Because the collection of bloods, that's my favorite.

1365
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:27,710
That's my favorite wall.

1366
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:28,950
Yeah, he's the height man.

1367
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:32,550
He's my passenger, princess.

1368
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:34,390
The wall pile.

1369
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:38,430
I gotta paint that wall red, guys.

1370
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:40,210
It's easier if I use people.

1371
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:41,770
Are you serious?

1372
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:43,750
I have property damage here?

1373
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:46,290
I'm chasing a guy.

1374
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:47,550
I...

1375
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:50,230
Okay, $100 on the meter.

1376
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:51,750
Oh, okay.

1377

Now I can ram.

1378
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:53,990
Okay.

1379
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:59,930
Why does it care about property damage when I'm literally...

1380
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:03,950
Trying to fucking- oh my god, okay, this is not fair.

1381
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:10,870
Okay.

1382
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:22,950
Oh my god, okay, okay, okay.

1383
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:24,350
It's fine.

1384
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:27,830
All right, it's fine.

1385
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:33,270
We got- Oh my god, you guys don't understand, this car is so hard to drive.

1386

They're getting ramped This car is so hard to drive you don't understand Okay, how many escort cars are there?

1387
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,140

1391
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,620
Oh, my God, please get closer.

1392
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,080
Please get closer.

1393
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,840
I have to get a little closer.

1394
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:21,720
Oh, all right.

1395
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,180

01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:24,760
We're so close.

1397
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:28,440

1398
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:30,280

Look, it said property debt.

Yeah, Chip and Cartier watches.

1420
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:13,260

01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,400
Holy shit, Tylo, and the cops drive.

1422

Oh, shit, Tylo.

1423
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,460
No, not the Tylo.

1424
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:22,140
Okay, what if I do?

1425
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,540
Okay, but why escape where I could do?

1426
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:28,040
Why escape where I could do that?

1427
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:29,100
Get out of here.

1428
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:32,220
Oh, shit.

1429
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:32,940
Oh, shit.

1430
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,260
Can I do any more proper yet?

1431
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:36,220
I'm already being caught by the police.

1432
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:36,780

Everything's fine.

1436
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:53,960
What do you think will happen with dog title?

1437
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,020
I don't know.

1438
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:55,920
He's an asshole.

1439
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:59,540
But he has friends in high places.

1440
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:00,080
All right.

1441
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,120

1442
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,180
Wait, you just got back.

1443
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,300
Get to know who's not my fake party and watch it.

1444
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:11,300
I'm working so hard for these things.

1445
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,320
No matter who's backing them.

1446
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:14,840

1449
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,340
Trying to believe dog eyes would turn on a friend like that.

1450
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:21,620
He always was a shit.

1451
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,820
Even when we were kids.

1452
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,620
Okay, I gotta be careful.

1453
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:30,140

My bike is pretty cool.

1486
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:12,860
He cheated.

1487
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,080
Ran me off the road at the last minute.

1488
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,580
Can you teach him a lesson?

1489
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,380
Keep him from doing it again?

1490
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:18,960
Yeah, sure.

1491
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:19,940
He's not far.

1492
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:21,160
Wreck his car.

1493
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:22,620
That'll teach him.

1494
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,700
Okay, if I do that, let...

Look at this.

1507
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,400
They just put it in the random street in the middle of the street.

1508
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:51,000
How is that my fault if I hit it?

1509
01:38:52,020 --> 01:39:01,380
It should be their fault for like not putting it away Hello Yeah, that tire iron from the trunk of the car

Your ex-girlfriend is mad at you.

1514
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:26,540

01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:02,400
Can I?

1532
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,380
Oh, I was going to use her as well.

1533
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,380
And be like, going to my car now.

1534
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:11,360
Perfect fitness.

1535
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:14,800
Alright.

1536
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:15,960
Let's see.

1537
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:17,600
I finished that mission.

1538
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:18,440
What's over here?

1539
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:19,900
High speed.

1540
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,660
Is that a racing objective?

1541
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:24,620
That has to be a racing one, right?

1542
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:25,240
RB.

1543
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:27,600
Oh, events start.

1544
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,080
What event is it?

1545
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:31,920
Is that racing, guys?

1546
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,400
Is that a racing one?

1547
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:36,740
I gotta know.

1548
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,320
Is that a racing mission?

1549
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,400
It sounds, it looks like a racing mission.

1550
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,620
A cop job.

1551
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,260
That doesn't sound fun.

1552
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,340
Oh yeah, no, fuck that shit.

1553
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,920
Alright, let's be good for once.

1554
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,360
Let's get a cop job.

1555
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,840
That sounds so wrong.

1556
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,760
It's like a bro job.

1557
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,820
But your buddy's a cop.

1558
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:15,980
That's literally what it says!

1559
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:19,560
It literally says cop job!

1560
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,780
Right there!

1561
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:21,720
Look!

1562
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:24,660
That sounds awful!

1563
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:37,720
It's a job for cops!

1564
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,700
Oh, wait, I'm actually a cop.

1565
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:46,480
We'll see you en route.

1566
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:47,560
Please stand by.

1567
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:48,680
Oh, shit.

1568
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:51,600
I'm like a riot police right now.

1569
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:53,520
That's right.

1570
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,200
It's a raid.

1571
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:04,090
That's fucking right.

1572
01:42:05,810 --> 01:42:06,850
Oh, shit.

1573
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:08,310
Oh, my God.

1574
01:42:08,910 --> 01:42:09,310
Sorry.

1575
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:13,050
What the fuck?

1576
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:16,030
That's fucking right.

1577
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:17,070
Steppy, steppy.

1578
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:20,990
I learned this in America.

1579
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:24,410
Wait, I need that cleaver.

1580
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:25,750
Oh, shit.

1581
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:30,670
Wait, let's...

1582
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:31,070

1583
01:42:31,190 --> 01:42:31,970
I'm grabbing this cleaver.

1584
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:32,890
There you go.

1585
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:33,350
Chop, chop.

1586
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:36,430
Are cops allowed to do this?

1587
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:40,550
Right.

1588
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:43,270
I learned this from my British boss.

1589
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:45,030
That's okay, right?

1590
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:47,190
Oh, shit.

1591
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:48,550

Do not resist, I say, with my butcher knife.

1595
01:43:23,290 --> 01:43:26,830
Officer Doki returns off her body cap.

1596
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:29,250
Oh, man.

I got a perfect score, though.

1600
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:36,290
Not very good.

1601
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:37,970
Sales are way down.

1602
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:39,350
Stop resisting.

1603
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:43,030
Hey, could you help me get some new designs?

1604
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:45,110

01:46:15,570 --> 01:46:16,630
Wait, let me grab him.

Tell me where the files are.

1652
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:37,790
It's okay, he works for the triad.

1653
01:46:41,070 --> 01:46:43,130
Yeah, why is he fighting back?

1654
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:44,470
I don't understand.

1655
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:45,210

1663
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:07,340

Alright, we have to go do that thing, the hallway, stairway.

Go listen to what she's saying.

1678
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:18,620
She's just role-playing.

1679
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:21,020
Thank God you guys don't understand what she's saying.

1680

Alright, here we go.

1711
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:14,400
This is my favorite pull now.

1712
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,120
What?

1713
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:17,960

1714
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,360
Oh, fuck.

1715
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:23,240

01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:24,840
That was...

1717
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:26,200
I think his back's broken.

1718
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:30,360
All right.

1719
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:31,900

1721
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:33,760
You learned your lesson?

1722
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,580
Time to sleep with the fishes.

1723
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:38,740
There you go.

1724
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:39,700

I need to relax soon, guys.

1750
01:52:12,860 --> 01:52:15,400
My muscles are aching.

1751
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:19,100
It's been a very long day.

1752
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:20,020
Yeah, exactly.

1753
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,080
Okay.

1754
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:25,960
I go this way.

1755
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:35,420
Wait, there's another cop job.

1756
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:39,700
I gotta turn off my body cam real quick, guys.

1757
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:45,680
Give me a sec.

1758
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,240
That's the round this one.

1759
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,340
Did I do it?

1760
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,740
Okay, I was on the job.

1761
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:03,660
I should be allowed to kill at least harm one citizen.

1762
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:05,880
Oh, shit.

1763
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:07,260
It's okay, they dodged it.

1764
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:11,000
I didn't say I meant harm.

1765
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:12,040
I should have at least...

1766
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:16,720
I should be legally allowed to harm one citizen if we're doing a chase.

1767
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:19,660
And be like, oopsie, you know?

1768
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:21,940
It's a little oopsie.

1769
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:25,920
It was an oopsie!

1770
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,360
How did I get property damage there?

1771
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:30,100
He fucking hit me!

1772
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:36,640
It was funny.

1773
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:39,900
They died for a good cause.

1774
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:41,340
They should be like...

1775
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:42,940
They're like...

1776
01:53:42,940 --> 01:53:44,760
Oh, shit.

1777
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:48,100
Okay.

1778
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:51,080
That's fine.

1779
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:52,620
It was just like...

1780
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:53,400
It was an accident.

1781
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:56,180
It should be...

1782
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,520
They died for a good cause.

1783
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:02,120
No, no, he's fine.

1784
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:03,420
It's just... He's fine.

1785
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:04,320
He's in the hospital.

1786
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:08,500
Oh, hey, there's that temple.

1787
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:09,780
Oh!

1788
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:12,860
It's fine.

1789
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:15,080
I think it's fine.

1790
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:16,700
I did it.

1791
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:26,900
Oh, my God.

1792
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:29,220
Don't worry.

1793
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:30,700
I got you.

1794
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:32,440
Press B.

1795
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:32,680
Why?

1796
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:33,940
Oh, I have to press B again.

1797
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:34,740
Oh, okay.

1798
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:36,080
Oh, thank God.

1799
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:38,520
Okay.

1800
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:41,020
You're arrested.

1801
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:43,900
Wait, how do I arrest you?

1802
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:46,000
How do I arrest you?

1803
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:52,540
How do I arrest you?

1804
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:55,840
Oh, my God.

1805
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:56,280
Please.

1806
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:57,680
Please stop resisting.

1807
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:00,800
Stop resisting.

1808
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:04,380
There we go.

1809
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:07,480
You saw that?

1810
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,180
How am I gonna...

1811
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:12,640
Oh, this is bad.

1812
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:14,220
Oh, there we go.

1813
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,140
Okay, I can bash him in the wall like one time then.

1814
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:20,500
There we go.

1815
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:22,820
And then I can arrest him.

1816
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:24,640
There we go.

1817
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:26,320
It's just that easy.

1818
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:27,880
Alright, now your turn.

1819
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:28,580
Get down.

1820
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:29,880
Get down from there.

1821
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:32,460
Guys, get down from there.

1822
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:34,640
I need you to stop resisting.

1823
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:36,480
Come on.

1824
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:37,600
Come on.

1825
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:39,360
Come on, little guy.

1826
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,600
Don't make me get the car.

1827
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:42,700
Don't make me get the car.

1828
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:43,360
Oh, that's it.

1829
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,300
That's it.

1830
01:55:52,030 --> 01:55:53,150
That's it.

There we go.

01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:09,690
He saw what happened.

1834
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:12,550
He didn't see nothing.

1835
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:15,630
He's in the name of the law.

1836
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:18,670
No more Mr. Nice cop.

1837

Wait, hold on, Gun.

How come we're going after Dark Eyes?

1854
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:01,450
Should we be fighting 18K?

1855
01:59:01,730 --> 01:59:02,730
Dark Eye came after us?

1856
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:03,850
This is payback.

1857
01:59:04,190 --> 01:59:05,090
Pain and simple.

1858
01:59:05,330 --> 01:59:07,070
What if Dark Eyes complains to Big Smile League?

1859
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:09,070
What if he sends Mr. Tong after us?

1860
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:09,670
Look, dude.

1861
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:11,370
What is he gonna do?

1862
01:59:11,870 --> 01:59:13,130
But Winston answers the record.

1863
01:59:15,090 --> 01:59:16,410
Nobody's going to fuck with the train.

1864
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:17,130
Exactly.

1865
01:59:17,390 --> 01:59:18,910
No one's gonna fuck with us.

1866
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:22,290
We know what's up.

1867
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:34,020
Oh, there's two telephone poles.

1868
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:36,180
That's fucking right.

1869
01:59:36,580 --> 01:59:37,060
Ring, ring.

1870
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:38,600
Your doctor's calling.

01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:43,000
Boom!

01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:46,200
Alright, wait, is that another?

01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:50,960
Oh, it's time to close shop!

Alright.

1875
01:59:59,000 --> 01:59:59,920
Oh, there's one more.

1876
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:01,400
Don't worry.

1877
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,040
There's one more.

1878
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:03,940
I'm gonna take you there.

1879
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:04,560
Don't worry.

1880
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:05,180
Oh, wait.

1881
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,000
Never mind.

1882
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:11,540
Not... I'm gonna pick you back up so I can take you to the closed shop.

1883
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:16,580
KK will never be the same.

1884
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:20,720
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

1885
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:22,440
But...

1886
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:23,160

Guys, don't worry, citizens.

1913
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:42,280
It's part of the tracks, exactly.

1914
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:46,760
Don't you hate it when you're red and green buses?

1915
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:52,360
Start arguing with each other and then start having a little ram fight?

1916

I've actually said that before.

1922
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,700
It's part of the experience.

02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:20,440

You took the wrong bus.

1926
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:28,880
You should have took the red taxis instead of the green buses.

1927
02:03:29,620 --> 02:03:31,220

1933
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:53,780

02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:06,960
That's so convenient.

1945
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:08,760
Wait, why is there a person here?

1946
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:09,520

Oh, I can hire him.

1953
02:05:29,370 --> 02:05:31,450
Wait, I don't want to hire him.

1954
02:05:35,650 --> 02:05:37,170
Oh, the cops don't know.

1955
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:38,850
Oh, he's got a bogeyng, oh?

1956
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:39,550

We'll be fine.

1976
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:21,780

Oh, this is a nice-ass car.

02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:14,100
It feels so smooth.

2023
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:17,300
All right, let's go meet up with Ming now.

I've been enjoying it a lot so far.

2027
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:28,210
I like the melee a lot.

2028
02:09:28,410 --> 02:09:30,590
I like that it's not- I like that- Oh, shit.

Rosella.

2050
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:40,620

02:11:07,230 --> 02:11:07,850
Oh, I'm feeling.

2061
02:11:07,950 --> 02:11:09,390

02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:28,390

2127
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:10,820

02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:26,300
You've got my money?

2140
02:14:26,620 --> 02:14:27,120
Got your money.

2141
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:27,980
Here's your package.

2142
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:31,200
Tell Ming to stick with girls over 14 this time.

2143
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:32,620
It's the cops.

2144
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:33,600
Stay cool.

2145
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:34,460
Hey, you too.

2146
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:35,180
Come over here.

2147
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:35,800
Let's go.

2148
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:36,820
Wait, guys.

2149
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:38,540
I think Ming might be a bad person.

2150
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:39,920
Oh, shit.

2151
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:40,860
Lose the cops.

2152
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:41,660
Oh, wait.

2153
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:42,340
That's me.

2154
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:43,560
That's right.

2155
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:44,780
I arrested you.

2156
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:47,460
That's... Oh, shit.

2157
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:54,180
I thought it was like, wait, that's me.

2158
02:14:57,720 --> 02:14:59,140
Guys, I think maybe...

2159
02:14:59,140 --> 02:14:59,680
Oh, shit.

2160
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:03,280
I think maybe Ming could be a bad guy, guys.

2161
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:04,080
Just maybe.

2162
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:05,240
Who would...

2163
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:07,300
I can't believe it.

2164
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:10,260
The man that works at a try-in might be a bad guy.

2165
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:12,180
Who would, I thought?

2166
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:14,560
That's...

2167
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:17,700
Oh, it's nice that they waited for me to hotwire a car.

2168
02:15:18,860 --> 02:15:19,700
That's good.

2169
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:22,360
You don't say.

2170
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:27,320
I'm glad that they waited for me before to hotwire this car.

2171
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:30,860
It's really hard to do, you don't know that.

2172
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:35,080
It's okay, I can get away.

2173
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:38,040
Oh wait, check out, is I a massage parlor?

2174
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,480
Does I...

2175
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:42,700
Wait a minute, guys.

2176
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:44,880
Is that a massage parlor right there?

2177
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:46,460
Oh wait, let me...

2178
02:15:46,460 --> 02:15:47,220
There we go.

2179
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:49,360
There you go.

2180
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:51,480
Let me just bash him in real quick.

2181
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:57,220
Oh shit, that's okay.

2182
02:15:57,460 --> 02:15:58,480
It's just minus five.

2183
02:16:04,820 --> 02:16:05,260
Okay.

2184
02:16:07,940 --> 02:16:09,060
Oh shit, that's more cops.

2185
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:10,200
Oh, I drove past the police.

2186
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:11,420
Oh my god, guys!

2187
02:16:11,660 --> 02:16:12,660
Guys, I fucked up.

2188
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:14,520
I drove past the police office.

2189
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:16,360
Police station.

2190
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:22,480

Oh wait, it's my phone.

2196
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:57,920
Where am I supposed to do?

2197
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:01,200
It's the same place.

2198
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:03,800
I have to call... Oh, okay.

2199
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:05,000
Inspector Tang?

2200
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:07,340
I got enough to bust Popstone.

2201
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:09,000
But I also met a supplier.

2202
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:10,480
Guy named Fang Shen.

2203
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:11,860
Find out where he hangs out.

2204
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:13,360
And I'll see if I can get something on.

2205
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:14,280
I'll get back to you.

2206
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:17,020
Oh, I gotta bring the drugs to Ming.

2207
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:19,600
You gotta get ketamine.

2208
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:22,080
That's like extra illegal.

2209
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:25,160
I can't believe it.

2210
02:17:25,220 --> 02:17:26,340
My homie Ming.

2211
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:29,700
Man, I can't believe he was actually a bad person.

2212
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:31,440
I can't believe it, guys.

2213
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:32,880
Who would have thought?

2214
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:36,880
The man that worked in the Triads done a lot of bad things.

2215
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:43,260
Alright.

2216
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:45,620
That's crazy.

2217
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:48,440
You think you knew a person, too, guys.

2218
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:50,400
You didn't think you would know a person.

2219
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:52,520
Unbelievable.

2220
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:56,880
Alright,

2221
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:01,020

2222
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:02,180

2224
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:09,180

2225
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:11,580
See, look at that!

2226
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:13,860
I gained cop experience, guys.

2227
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:15,000
Oh my god!

2228
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:16,640
Wait, I leveled up!

2229
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,320
Let's go!

2230
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:22,880
I finally got a promotion after 20 years.

2231
02:18:24,020 --> 02:18:24,240
Alright.

2232
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:25,300
What can I upgrade?

2233
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,160
Okay, I feel like we should fast disarm.

2234
02:18:28,980 --> 02:18:29,240
Yeah, I know.

2235
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:30,260
That's actually good.

2236
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:33,880
Okay, I know I have melee training.

2237
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,460
Wait, how come I still can't?

2238
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:39,260
Oh, I have to return two more statues before I can do that.

2239
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:45,340
Popstars connect supplies at Lokbu Park.

2240

Popstar will have to reach out to another supplier.

2373
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:13,600

2374
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:14,160
I agree.

2375
02:28:14,620 --> 02:28:17,560
If I'm gonna get close to him, I'm gonna need a good disguise.

2376
02:28:18,020 --> 02:28:19,400
Can you have your people send something over?

2377
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:19,860

02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:33,260
I can give you a ride.

2403
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:36,240
I mean, it'll be easier than explaining where it is.

2404
02:29:37,780 --> 02:29:38,180
Uh...

2405
02:29:38,580 --> 02:29:40,580

02:31:21,220 --> 02:31:21,620
Wow.

2412
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:25,160
This is a pretty cool place for a kung fu school.

2413
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:26,940
Unfortunately, the school isn't in the temple.

2414
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:28,540
But not that temple anyway.

2415
02:31:28,740 --> 02:31:30,740
Didn't they use this temple as a backdrop for...

2416
02:31:30,740 --> 02:31:31,740
Figure one, dude.

2417
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:33,160
What was it, fists of carnage?

2418
02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:36,180
No, it was using the grandfathers of the Shaolin Fist.

2419
02:31:41,650 --> 02:31:42,050
Whoa.

2420
02:31:42,950 --> 02:32:07,270

2422
02:32:22,310 --> 02:32:23,070
What, Seifu?

2423
02:32:25,690 --> 02:32:26,830
Can I help you?

2424
02:32:27,150 --> 02:32:29,930
Yeah, I'd like to sign up for some Kung Fu classes.

2425
02:32:30,550 --> 02:32:32,030
I read about your school in my guidebook.

2426
02:32:32,390 --> 02:32:34,050
Ah, your guidebook.

2427
02:32:34,190 --> 02:32:41,090
Yeah, it said you teach a style with a long lineage, but in spite of all that, it's still considered very effective.

2428
02:32:41,150 --> 02:32:42,850
You want to take classes, okay.

2429
02:32:43,990 --> 02:32:46,890
And you, did you also read up?

2430
02:32:46,910 --> 02:33:17,350

2432
02:33:20,690 --> 02:33:23,250
He's like, bro, good, nice.

2433
02:33:27,270 --> 02:33:27,870
Yeah.

2434
02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:30,890
Use movement plus X.

2435
02:33:33,530 --> 02:33:34,510
Oh, I see.

2436
02:33:34,730 --> 02:33:38,490
But why would I do that when I can just scrap her?

2437
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:44,360
Okay, nice.

2438
02:33:45,400 --> 02:33:46,940
He's like, you got game, wait.

2439
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:49,720
I see time in America has rusted out.

2440
02:33:55,690 --> 02:33:57,030
Oh, it's that.

2441
02:33:57,950 --> 02:33:59,990
Okay, but why do that when...

2442
02:33:59,990 --> 02:34:00,890
I'm sorry, this...

2443
02:34:00,890 --> 02:34:03,210
I know there's like a lot of really cool combos.

2444
02:34:05,930 --> 02:34:06,970
But like...

2445
02:34:06,970 --> 02:34:09,710
The grapple is just so convenient.

2446
02:34:12,750 --> 02:34:14,410
Wait, it won't let me grapple!

2447
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:16,710
A crack grapple inside?

2448
02:34:18,590 --> 02:34:20,050
Oh my god, wait.

2449
02:34:21,070 --> 02:34:23,590
Guys, they won't let me grapple indoors.

2450
02:34:23,750 --> 02:34:24,670
It's like Professor Oak.

2451
02:34:25,210 --> 02:34:27,150
There's a time and place for everything.

2452
02:34:28,110 --> 02:34:30,370
Apparently I'm not allowed to grapple inside.

2453
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:34,510
I was gonna be like, it's time.

2454
02:34:35,710 --> 02:34:37,710
For the one thing that I do know.

2455
02:34:42,530 --> 02:34:43,050
Yeah.

2456
02:34:46,470 --> 02:34:46,990
Okay.

2457
02:34:47,930 --> 02:34:48,830
I did it.

2458
02:34:48,910 --> 02:34:50,790
Try to steer them in the right direction.

2459
02:34:51,310 --> 02:34:53,090
No grappling in Kung Fu.

2460
02:34:54,110 --> 02:34:56,310
But they all want to be Song-ung Yi.

2461
02:34:59,870 --> 02:35:02,710
Now I just trained them in the ways of my art.

2462
02:35:03,530 --> 02:35:05,870
Try to teach them compassion and discretion.

2463
02:35:06,470 --> 02:35:08,630
And pray for the best.

2464
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:11,590
See if I don't think there's much more you can do.

2465
02:35:13,530 --> 02:35:15,390
Oh, Jade Rat.

2466
02:35:16,830 --> 02:35:17,810
Song Dynasty, right?

2467
02:35:18,030 --> 02:35:18,690
Very good.

2468
02:35:19,110 --> 02:35:19,970
Song Dynasty?

2469
02:35:20,850 --> 02:35:22,610
That's like a thousand years old or something.

2470
02:35:22,710 --> 02:35:23,450
Yeah, is that real?

2471
02:35:23,650 --> 02:35:23,850
That's real?

2472
02:35:24,510 --> 02:35:26,050
Part of a set of 12.

2473
02:35:26,730 --> 02:35:27,950
One for each animal.

2474
02:35:28,130 --> 02:35:29,630
This should be in a museum, sir.

2475
02:35:30,750 --> 02:35:31,270
Yeah.

2476
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:33,630
What happened to the others?

2477
02:35:34,130 --> 02:35:38,210
Stolen by a former student corrupted by the triads.

2478
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:40,550
I'm so sorry to hear that sea fool.

2479
02:35:41,630 --> 02:35:42,790
Wait, this should be in a museum.

2480
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:44,070
Why do we...

2481
02:35:44,070 --> 02:35:47,330
This collection meant a lot to me.

2482
02:35:47,570 --> 02:35:50,090
But sometimes you just have to let things go.

2483
02:35:52,610 --> 02:35:53,670
I should close up.

2484
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:56,170
It was good to see you again, Wei.

2485
02:35:57,330 --> 02:35:59,470

02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:00,730

2488
02:36:06,130 --> 02:36:06,950
Oh, you need to get home.

Wait, why can't I do it?

2501
02:37:28,780 --> 02:37:30,360
Why can't I do it?

2502
02:37:31,860 --> 02:37:32,980
Oh, there we go.

2503
02:37:33,100 --> 02:37:34,620
I have to hold both of them.

2504
02:37:34,980 --> 02:37:35,880
All right, I can do it again.

2505
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:39,820
No!

02:37:55,080 --> 02:37:55,760
Okay.

I'm sorry, Seafo!

2513
02:38:09,300 --> 02:38:11,040

Oh, sorry, okay, okay, I'll learn for you, Seifu!

2516
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:30,140
Jesus Christ.

Jesus.

2518
02:38:41,310 --> 02:38:43,130
How much more do I have to... Oh, this guy.

Oh, he has a yellow belt?

2521
02:38:44,850 --> 02:38:45,410
That's sad.

2522
02:38:45,510 --> 02:38:46,790
I'm beating up a yellow belt.

2523
02:38:51,570 --> 02:39:03,590
I have one more statue.

2524
02:39:04,190 --> 02:39:05,610
I remember I stole another one.

2525
02:39:06,430 --> 02:39:07,750
I found one of your statues.

2526
02:39:08,050 --> 02:39:08,490
The sheep.

2527
02:39:09,270 --> 02:39:10,390

This is the one I want to learn.

2531
02:39:44,510 --> 02:39:45,650
I want to break some legs.

2532
02:39:51,490 --> 02:39:51,890

I'm gonna break your students' legs.

2534
02:39:57,130 --> 02:39:58,710
I'm gonna do it again, too.

2535
02:39:59,570 --> 02:40:01,290
Breaking, I'm gonna break your other leg.

2536
02:40:02,370 --> 02:40:02,950
That's right.

2537
02:40:03,070 --> 02:40:03,830
Oh, again.

2538
02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:05,070
Let me...

2539
02:40:05,070 --> 02:40:05,570
All right.

2540
02:40:07,090 --> 02:40:08,690
It's time to do it again.

2541
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:10,110
See, who wants me to do it again?

2542
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:10,750
I'm sorry.

2543
02:40:15,990 --> 02:40:18,810
That's right, right and left leg!

2544
02:40:21,310 --> 02:40:25,030
Just do it again, breaking it in eight places!

2545
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:28,170
See who wants me to do that!

2546
02:40:31,890 --> 02:40:33,530
There you go.

2547
02:40:38,860 --> 02:40:40,380
Breaking all legs today.

2548
02:40:41,820 --> 02:40:43,960
Oh, the scream of anguish!

2549
02:40:43,980 --> 02:40:46,600
Makes me want to go harder on you.

2550
02:40:50,710 --> 02:40:51,290
That's right.

2551
02:40:52,150 --> 02:40:54,210
Nobody's going to be walking tonight.

2552
02:40:56,570 --> 02:40:58,370
You've got to balance it all out.

2553
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:03,580
Oh, shit.

2554
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:04,880
Okay, I didn't mean to do that.

2555
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:07,460
Let's stop.

2556
02:41:07,700 --> 02:41:09,160
This is just training.

2557
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:12,520
It's not my buddies teaching me how to break legs.

2558
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:14,820
That's what Sifu wanted.

2559
02:41:14,820 --> 02:41:20,280
All right, where do we go now?

2560
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:21,820
Oh, the golden coil.

2561
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:23,060
Club Bam-Bam!

2562
02:41:25,020 --> 02:41:26,980
Who's gonna pay for all of these?

2563
02:41:27,500 --> 02:41:31,200
Well, maybe it's on them to stop sucking at this shit.

2564
02:41:31,720 --> 02:41:33,500
They're the ones that disappointed the Seifu.

2565
02:41:39,850 --> 02:41:42,810
It's their fault for disappointing him.

2566
02:41:44,170 --> 02:41:45,550
He's in a guidebook, guys.

2567
02:41:45,590 --> 02:41:47,410
He can get as many students as he wants.

And law one.

2625
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:26,860

02:46:36,930 --> 02:46:39,370
And the law won.

2627
02:46:39,850 --> 02:46:42,610

2634
02:47:02,130 --> 02:47:04,810

02:47:05,870 --> 02:47:09,550

02:50:35,260 --> 02:50:36,220
All right.

Oh, there is.

2711
02:51:38,900 --> 02:51:41,040

2724
02:52:31,900 --> 02:52:33,480
Why, where's the rest of the bouncers?

2725
02:52:34,760 --> 02:52:37,320
The fish didn't do anything, the horror.

2726
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:41,080
Okay, we're...

Okay, give me a sec.

It's time to turn off the music!

2733
02:53:01,130 --> 02:53:03,210
Okay, we gotta get this guy out of here.

2734
02:53:03,870 --> 02:53:06,090
Are any environmental kills here around me?

2735
02:53:06,670 --> 02:53:07,710

2745
02:53:30,490 --> 02:53:30,990
Stab, stab!

2746
02:53:30,990 --> 02:53:31,230
Stab, you stab!

2747
02:53:32,750 --> 02:53:33,550

2748
02:53:36,930 --> 02:53:37,550
Oh, wait.

2749
02:53:39,330 --> 02:53:40,010
There we go.

2750
02:53:40,210 --> 02:53:41,590
You don't need that because we should walk, right?

2751
02:53:42,290 --> 02:53:46,690
I think this is my second favorite move now.

2752
02:53:54,570 --> 02:53:55,070
Slam dunk!

2753
02:53:56,850 --> 02:53:57,610

2754
02:54:00,710 --> 02:54:00,970
Alright.

2755
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:02,390
Are you still alive?

2756
02:54:02,650 --> 02:54:03,290
There you go.

02:54:05,230 --> 02:54:06,490

2760
02:54:15,080 --> 02:54:17,540

Give me a sec.

2768
02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:03,820
This is very important.

2769
02:55:04,980 --> 02:55:06,300
Wash your hands.

2770
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:10,940
All right.

2771
02:55:11,780 --> 02:55:12,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2772
02:55:14,860 --> 02:55:15,280
Okay.

2773
02:55:15,740 --> 02:55:15,900
All right.

2774
02:55:18,180 --> 02:55:19,460
I can't grapple this man.

2775
02:55:20,180 --> 02:55:21,500
Yeah, he won't let me grapple him.

2776
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:24,080
That's fucked up.

2777
02:55:25,220 --> 02:55:26,560
How to beat him up.

2778
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:27,400
Normally.

2779
02:55:30,280 --> 02:55:31,600
There we go.

2780
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:40,280
Relax, Benny.

2781
02:55:40,420 --> 02:55:41,400
I'm not gonna kill you.

2782
02:55:41,860 --> 02:55:42,040
Okay.

2783
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:42,740
Just listen.

2784
02:55:43,220 --> 02:55:43,660
Okay.

2785
02:55:44,220 --> 02:55:45,040
What do you want?

2786
02:55:45,180 --> 02:55:45,960
Just what I said.

2787
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:47,940
Winston wants to be your friend.

2788
02:55:52,220 --> 02:55:53,620
And what about dark eyes?

2789
02:55:54,200 --> 02:55:55,020
That's your problem.

2790
02:55:55,380 --> 02:55:56,060
I hope you're right.

2791
02:55:56,100 --> 02:55:57,720
Oh, punch and kick the grapplers.

2792
02:55:58,540 --> 02:55:59,160
Can I go now?

2793
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:00,940
Of course you can, Benny.

2794
02:56:05,860 --> 02:56:06,280
Yay!

2795
02:56:14,090 --> 02:56:15,190

02:56:19,270 --> 02:56:20,650

02:56:21,050 --> 02:56:23,230

2799
02:56:23,930 --> 02:56:26,230
Wait, let me hang out at the Bam Bam Club.

2800
02:56:28,850 --> 02:56:30,510
Wait, no, take me back!

2802
02:56:33,450 --> 02:56:34,330
He's got a real hard on.

2803
02:56:34,950 --> 02:56:35,970
Is your cover compromised?

2804
02:56:36,210 --> 02:56:37,730
Well, you haven't fished me out of the harbour yet.

2805
02:56:38,510 --> 02:56:38,670
Alright.

02:56:40,030 --> 02:56:40,670
How am I doing?

2808
02:56:41,810 --> 02:56:42,450
Fuck, Raymond.

2809
02:56:42,570 --> 02:56:43,210
Where do I start?

2810
02:56:43,410 --> 02:56:45,250
There's a civil war brewing in the sun on ye.

2811
02:56:45,510 --> 02:56:47,110
Winston and Dog Eyes escalated practically.

2812
02:56:47,390 --> 02:56:48,810
Me and Tiffany could have more karaoke time.

2813
02:56:49,570 --> 02:56:50,910
Personally, how are you doing?

2814
02:56:52,410 --> 02:56:52,870
Look, Raymond.

2815
02:56:53,570 --> 02:56:54,270
I gotta get back.

02:56:54,430 --> 02:56:55,630
Your state of mind is an important way.

2817
02:56:55,870 --> 02:56:56,590
It's important to me.

2818
02:56:56,730 --> 02:56:58,090
It's important to how you do your job.

2819
02:56:58,850 --> 02:57:14,130
I do my job just yeah and that's for me to decide you mean Pendrew Pendrew assigned me as your controller and listen way Pendrew may not be concerned about you But I am I know you have a personal stake here, but this cannot be a vendetta We're cops There are rules.

02:57:14,310 --> 02:57:14,830
You're a cop.

2821
02:57:15,170 --> 02:57:16,390
I'm an undercover cop.

2822
02:57:16,750 --> 02:57:17,350
The rules are different.

2823
02:57:17,450 --> 02:57:25,450

This is such a sad bed.

2829
02:57:44,130 --> 02:57:46,670
I think the fact that I only have one pillow makes it sadder.

2830
02:57:49,290 --> 02:57:51,570
We're really pressed to cycle through.

2831
02:57:55,580 --> 02:57:56,840

2832
02:57:58,180 --> 02:57:58,960

Do you think she should...

2852

How the fuck do I get there?

They're like burying it up as if it's illegal or something.

03:00:43,060 --> 03:00:44,220

03:03:49,130 --> 03:03:50,570
He's going to go for the eyes.

2928
03:03:54,250 --> 03:03:54,850
Come on.

2929
03:04:05,560 --> 03:04:06,580

2930
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:07,840

03:04:08,380 --> 03:04:09,020

2939
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:25,560

2946
03:04:40,820 --> 03:04:41,740
I knew it.

2947
03:04:44,160 --> 03:04:45,480
Dinner is served.

2948
03:04:45,800 --> 03:04:47,720
I get to eat the loser too afterwards.

2949
03:04:48,220 --> 03:04:49,460
It's a win-win for me.

2950
03:04:52,160 --> 03:04:53,260
There's a guy over there.

2951
03:04:54,300 --> 03:04:55,160
Do I need to help him?

2952
03:04:55,560 --> 03:04:56,640

03:05:00,320 --> 03:05:01,720

That sounds like my parents when they drive.

2967
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:16,340
I've actually heard that exact phrase from my parents whenever they yell at people for driving.

2968
03:06:21,260 --> 03:06:24,380
He's like, Oh, guys, it's a Zataya.

2969
03:06:25,140 --> 03:06:29,060
I've actually, that's the exact phrase they would say.

03:06:31,400 --> 03:06:31,840
Yeah!

2971
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:41,040

2972
03:06:43,700 --> 03:06:45,100
It's so realistic.

2973
03:06:45,980 --> 03:06:47,800
It's a true driving immersion.

2974
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:51,600
They'll be like, where did you learn that way?

2975
03:06:51,760 --> 03:06:55,140
And I'm just, I just learned it from listening to them while driving.

2976
03:07:00,610 --> 03:07:01,210
Where the needle?

2977
03:07:01,390 --> 03:07:02,310

3018
03:10:52,020 --> 03:10:52,340

3019
03:10:52,840 --> 03:10:54,900

Try to keep up.

3027
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:12,180
Why is it... Why did it zoom into the face wash?

3028
03:11:13,640 --> 03:11:14,600
A cheese paste.

3029
03:11:14,680 --> 03:11:15,980
Oh, I'm face level too!

3030
03:11:20,180 --> 03:11:21,620
Hey, do I have more karaoke?

3031
03:11:23,060 --> 03:11:24,380
Oh my god, I can sing by myself.

3032
03:11:24,460 --> 03:11:25,060
I don't need her.

3033
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:30,120
Why are you all like I love so...

3034
03:11:33,200 --> 03:11:34,660
Alright, how do I leave you?

3035
03:11:35,360 --> 03:11:36,460
Oh, it's starting to get...

3036
03:11:36,460 --> 03:11:37,620
Oh my god, wait, it's a nighttime?

3037
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:39,520
Is that how long I've been singing for?

3038
03:11:40,660 --> 03:11:42,760
Oh my god, I sang till nighttime.

3039
03:11:47,640 --> 03:11:50,120
Oh my gosh, I hope Amanda wasn't waiting too long.

3040
03:11:51,220 --> 03:11:51,640
It's okay.

3041
03:11:52,440 --> 03:11:52,820
It's okay.

3042
03:11:52,900 --> 03:11:55,420
I never said what time I was gonna go see her, guys.

3043
03:11:55,520 --> 03:11:55,900
It's okay.

3044
03:11:56,760 --> 03:11:58,120
I never said what time.

3045
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:00,620
Wait, why can't I get on my bike?

3046
03:12:01,540 --> 03:12:02,680
Alright, let's see.

3047
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:05,220

3048
03:12:05,320 --> 03:12:06,340
Oh my god, it's so far.

3049
03:12:06,400 --> 03:12:07,120
I'm going to get a taxi.

3050
03:12:07,260 --> 03:12:07,820

Alright, take me to Amanda's...

I'm a massage connoisseur.

3234
03:24:08,500 --> 03:24:09,760
I can just replace you.

3235
03:24:09,900 --> 03:24:12,520

But the massage parlor will always be there for me.

3239
03:24:30,780 --> 03:24:32,040

Amanda used to call me sexy.

03:27:04,300 --> 03:27:06,360
I don't think that was supposed to happen.

3268
03:27:09,580 --> 03:27:11,420
You would think she...

3269
03:27:11,420 --> 03:27:14,260
I don't think that was supposed to happen there.

3270
03:27:17,240 --> 03:27:19,420
You would think he's suspicious if I do that?

3271
03:27:20,860 --> 03:27:21,440
Oh, shit.

3272
03:27:23,120 --> 03:27:24,820
Okay, I just need to, like, not get hit.

3273
03:27:27,080 --> 03:27:29,380
Just another day in Hong Kong, you know?

3274
03:27:31,480 --> 03:27:31,920
Okay.

3275
03:27:33,480 --> 03:27:34,980
So that's why I don't get my car hit.

3276
03:27:35,140 --> 03:27:36,100
It should be fine.

3277
03:27:40,880 --> 03:27:41,900
I'm my heart's broken.

3278
03:27:42,120 --> 03:27:43,280
It's time to do a drug bus.

3279
03:27:45,880 --> 03:27:48,680
I need to get you a cop job to mend my broken heart.

3280
03:27:50,340 --> 03:27:52,900
Is this a sus if you drive on the other side?

3281
03:27:53,020 --> 03:27:53,940
I don't think so.

3282
03:27:59,220 --> 03:28:03,080
Guys, I think it might have been suspicious that I drove on the other side.

3283
03:28:03,460 --> 03:28:03,900
Okay.

3284
03:28:15,610 --> 03:28:17,990
He's not even driving on the fucking road.

3285
03:28:18,350 --> 03:28:19,810
How am I the bad person here?

3286
03:28:24,160 --> 03:28:25,400
Okay, we're here.

3287
03:28:45,220 --> 03:28:47,400
Fribs, thank you for the super chat, thank you.

3288
03:28:47,400 --> 03:28:48,460
Okay, because I'm on the route.

3289
03:28:48,560 --> 03:28:49,220
Don't worry, I have a hat.

3290
03:28:49,340 --> 03:28:50,180
They won't know.

3291
03:28:53,860 --> 03:28:54,000
Ooh.

3292
03:28:55,020 --> 03:28:55,680
Is he going to know?

3293
03:28:56,420 --> 03:28:57,660
What if I, like...

3294
03:28:57,660 --> 03:28:58,680
Okay, wait, I'm curious.

3295
03:28:58,800 --> 03:28:59,580
What if I just look at the...

3296
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:02,700

3300
03:29:55,300 --> 03:29:57,180
Okay, I know this works.

3301
03:29:59,980 --> 03:30:00,820
I get caught.

3302
03:30:00,960 --> 03:30:02,800
Okay, that makes sense, you know?

3303
03:30:03,680 --> 03:30:05,840
That makes sense.

3304
03:30:09,340 --> 03:30:12,440
I thought it would work the entire time!

3305
03:30:13,100 --> 03:30:16,940
Okay, here you go.

3306
03:30:20,200 --> 03:30:22,140
What happens if I stack?

3307
03:30:22,160 --> 03:30:23,160
And in the open.

3308
03:30:27,490 --> 03:30:28,470
I like how they don't notice me.

3309
03:30:28,490 --> 03:30:30,290
Just jump down and just stand there.

3310
03:30:32,510 --> 03:30:32,770
Okay.

3311
03:30:34,770 --> 03:30:35,890
I got him.

3312
03:30:37,750 --> 03:30:38,410
Got him.

3313
03:30:40,110 --> 03:30:41,190
I'm just mad.

3314
03:30:41,870 --> 03:30:43,050
Standing mad emoji.

3315
03:30:44,370 --> 03:30:46,590
I spy with my little eye.

3316
03:30:46,990 --> 03:30:47,910
A drug dealer.

3317
03:30:49,010 --> 03:30:50,150
Do you spy?

3318
03:30:50,370 --> 03:30:52,770
Do you see a drug dealer right now?

3319
03:30:54,170 --> 03:30:55,830
Where is it?

3320
03:30:57,690 --> 03:30:58,850
There it is.

3321
03:30:59,830 --> 03:31:01,470
That's a drug deal.

3322
03:31:05,850 --> 03:31:08,750
Wait until Popstar Crew head to the...

3323
03:31:08,750 --> 03:31:09,810
Right there!

3324
03:31:10,510 --> 03:31:11,270
Bombinos!

3325
03:31:18,640 --> 03:31:21,100
Wait, who is the guy I have to follow?

3326
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:26,100
Wait, what?

3327
03:31:28,000 --> 03:31:28,440
Oh.

3328
03:31:32,810 --> 03:31:33,590
You did it.

3329
03:31:33,630 --> 03:31:34,270
Muy bien.

3330
03:31:40,900 --> 03:31:41,880
Fucking bitch.

3331
03:31:43,040 --> 03:31:44,780
I can't do that.

3332
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:46,280
Can't do that to me.

3333
03:31:47,760 --> 03:31:49,020
I live here.

3334
03:31:49,840 --> 03:31:50,420
I'm gonna sleep.

3335
03:31:51,300 --> 03:31:52,000
Get to board.

3336
03:31:52,600 --> 03:31:54,300
I should get an Oscar for this.

3337
03:31:54,680 --> 03:31:54,680
Oh

3338
03:31:58,540 --> 03:32:00,840
my god.

3339
03:32:01,060 --> 03:32:02,500
I can vomit on command.

3340
03:32:03,460 --> 03:32:04,740
Holy shit.

3341
03:32:05,340 --> 03:32:05,780
Holy shit.

3342
03:32:11,080 --> 03:32:12,300
Oh wait, she's bomb.

3343
03:32:12,400 --> 03:32:14,480
He's like, oh my god, no, I can't do that.

3344
03:32:15,440 --> 03:32:17,200
Oh my god, damn, Wei.

3345
03:32:17,780 --> 03:32:19,660
Why the fuck did he decide to be a cop?

3346
03:32:20,120 --> 03:32:20,960
Could be an actor.

3347
03:32:21,380 --> 03:32:23,920
Yeah, that's a method actor right there.

3348
03:32:25,260 --> 03:32:27,640
That's crazy that he could just do that.

3349
03:32:29,320 --> 03:32:31,000
Wei is 100% committed.

3350
03:32:36,150 --> 03:32:37,510
Hey, drunken master.

3351
03:32:37,690 --> 03:32:38,210
Let's go.

3352
03:32:49,460 --> 03:32:50,460
Yeah, you see what you're missing out?

3353
03:32:50,480 --> 03:32:51,220
Shout out Amanda!

3354
03:32:52,960 --> 03:32:53,360
Yeah,

3355
03:32:56,530 --> 03:32:57,450
they're not from Seafood.

3356
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:12,100
It's okay, I got the photo before he died.

3357
03:33:13,180 --> 03:33:13,820
Oh, shit.

3358
03:33:16,460 --> 03:33:17,680
Maybe I should have called...

3359
03:33:18,320 --> 03:33:21,640
Maybe I should have called it when he photographed it when he killed him.

3360
03:33:22,200 --> 03:33:23,760
Just down the drug pipeline at least.

3361
03:33:24,080 --> 03:33:25,520
And I'm giving you pop star on a platter.

3362
03:33:25,860 --> 03:33:27,620
I got the deal and the double cross on camera.

3363
03:33:28,980 --> 03:33:29,900
There they go.

3364
03:33:36,300 --> 03:33:36,740
Goodbye.

3365
03:33:39,340 --> 03:33:42,640
Whoa, parkour.

3366
03:33:44,220 --> 03:33:45,400
You just killed him like that.

3367
03:33:45,880 --> 03:33:46,520
Oh, I'm clumsy.

3368
03:33:46,920 --> 03:33:48,320
How did I get minus five?

3369
03:33:48,520 --> 03:33:49,160
Because I...

3370
03:33:49,160 --> 03:33:51,140
Oh, because I made a fool of myself.

3371
03:33:51,820 --> 03:33:54,260
Like, cops don't just ram in the things.

3372
03:33:55,940 --> 03:33:57,340
That's such a good score, too.

3373
03:33:58,980 --> 03:34:32,300

I'm just a little chicken truck!

3375
03:34:41,320 --> 03:34:41,960
Alright.

3376
03:34:42,540 --> 03:34:43,760
It's fine, I still have three stars.

3377
03:34:47,460 --> 03:34:49,140
I'm just a little chicken truck.

3378
03:34:49,760 --> 03:34:51,280
I'm just so, I'm so harmless.

3379
03:34:54,360 --> 03:34:56,220
We've charged Popstar and his top lieutenants.

3380
03:34:56,760 --> 03:34:59,960
Conspiracy, trafficking, possession, and murder.

3381
03:34:59,960 --> 03:35:01,780
Obtain murder and drug evidence.

3382
03:35:03,300 --> 03:35:04,400
Oh, nice.

3383
03:35:04,540 --> 03:35:08,160
I've done more to stop drugs coming into Hong Kong than half the narcotic squad combined.

3384
03:35:09,700 --> 03:35:10,740
I did it.

3385
03:35:11,600 --> 03:35:12,060
Yay!

3386
03:35:12,920 --> 03:35:14,040
I'm a good cop.

3387
03:35:14,500 --> 03:35:15,180
Let me go.

3388
03:35:16,140 --> 03:35:17,880
Jackie was gonna be proud of me.

3389
03:35:18,100 --> 03:35:20,060
Death of Officer Charles Ho?

3390
03:35:20,860 --> 03:35:22,400
Who's Officer Charles Ho?

3391
03:35:23,600 --> 03:35:24,840
Okay, let's see.

3392
03:35:25,360 --> 03:35:26,940
Form a rising strike.

3393
03:35:27,660 --> 03:35:28,160
We'll do that.

3394
03:35:30,380 --> 03:35:31,980
That looks cool as hell.

3395
03:35:32,680 --> 03:35:33,780
Now I can.

3396
03:35:35,760 --> 03:35:37,240
Okay, we don't need slow mode.

3397
03:35:37,540 --> 03:35:38,580
Let's get a slim gym.

3398
03:35:44,090 --> 03:35:44,810
What's this?

3399
03:35:45,270 --> 03:35:47,970
Perform an action hijack while being chased.

3400
03:35:48,190 --> 03:35:49,690
Increased ramming damage.

3401
03:35:52,620 --> 03:35:55,380
Yeah, I feel like I break into a lot of cars.

3402
03:35:56,180 --> 03:35:56,460
Okay.

3403
03:35:57,300 --> 03:35:58,580
Wait, what's this?

3404
03:36:01,700 --> 03:36:02,700
What's over here?

3405
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:06,520
Oh my god, it's a fucking racing thing again.

3406
03:36:07,680 --> 03:36:08,580
Let's see.

3407
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:20,380
Oh, I just have Jade statues.

3408
03:36:20,600 --> 03:36:21,680
Oh, did I do all of it?

3409
03:36:24,640 --> 03:36:25,360
Oh, never mind.

3410
03:36:25,640 --> 03:36:27,060
Winston wants to talk to me at the restaurant.

3411
03:36:28,760 --> 03:36:29,380
Meet Winston.

3412
03:36:34,880 --> 03:36:37,320

3413
03:36:38,380 --> 03:36:38,780
Yay!

3414
03:36:40,540 --> 03:36:41,200
I can't.

3415
03:36:42,120 --> 03:36:42,700
Pumpin.

3416
03:36:43,680 --> 03:36:44,140
Pimpin.

3417
03:36:44,460 --> 03:36:45,780
I keep it pimping.

3418
03:36:46,920 --> 03:36:48,640
All right, let's go.

3419
03:36:49,060 --> 03:36:55,720
Before we do that, before we do that, I got him in a broken heart.

3420
03:36:56,220 --> 03:36:57,540
The only way I know.

3421
03:37:05,510 --> 03:37:09,370
The only way I know to fix a broken heart.

3422
03:37:09,810 --> 03:37:11,670
Wait, do you think Tiffany will answer my call?

3423
03:37:12,030 --> 03:37:12,890
Oh, it's just trash.

3424
03:37:13,030 --> 03:37:13,490
Never mind.

3425
03:37:18,610 --> 03:37:35,710
No, I gotta let out this anger inside me There's other ways to mend a broken heart It's not just a massage parlor Guys, there's other ways to fix a broken heart

3426
03:37:38,990 --> 03:37:46,410
I've cleared my head But I'm still filled with anger So there's only one thing I can do.

3427
03:37:48,650 --> 03:37:49,590
That's right.

3428
03:37:52,670 --> 03:37:56,270
Put you in the trash like how she put me in the trash.

3429
03:38:00,280 --> 03:38:02,280
That's fucking right.

3430
03:38:04,420 --> 03:38:08,460
No one's gonna call you like she stopped calling me.

3431
03:38:11,840 --> 03:38:14,360
She wouldn't even ask her back.

3432
03:38:20,900 --> 03:38:21,680
Hello!

3433
03:38:23,720 --> 03:38:24,180

It's okay.

3437
03:38:40,080 --> 03:38:42,280
I'm taking the law in my own hands.

3438
03:38:49,380 --> 03:38:50,680
And let out.

3439
03:38:51,020 --> 03:38:53,240
Do you want to talk about it?

3440
03:38:55,140 --> 03:38:57,140
I don't need to talk about anything.

3441
03:39:00,800 --> 03:39:01,220
Alright, don't worry.

3442
03:39:01,640 --> 03:39:01,860

3452
03:39:56,430 --> 03:39:58,490
They don't deserve it.

3453
03:39:58,550 --> 03:39:59,290
Don't care.

3454
03:40:00,590 --> 03:40:02,030
I feel a lot better now.

3455
03:40:02,950 --> 03:40:03,630

3456
03:40:09,030 --> 03:40:10,390

3457
03:40:11,630 --> 03:40:12,090
Amanda who?

3458
03:40:12,090 --> 03:40:14,070
I don't know who she is.

3459
03:40:15,170 --> 03:40:17,270
She cheated those guys.

3460
03:40:19,330 --> 03:40:21,550
There was like a camera so I could hijack.

3461
03:40:25,040 --> 03:40:26,060
Where's the camera?

3462
03:40:26,720 --> 03:40:27,100
Oh, whatever.

3463
03:40:29,180 --> 03:40:31,860
Let's go talk to Winston.

3464
03:40:38,730 --> 03:40:39,910
It's all right.

3465
03:40:40,870 --> 03:40:42,650
You know who won't betray me?

3466
03:40:45,470 --> 03:40:46,450
You're right.

3467
03:40:46,730 --> 03:40:49,170
Only a pork bun can make me a whole man.

3468
03:40:52,990 --> 03:40:53,710
Nice.

3469
03:40:54,570 --> 03:40:55,570
There we go.

3470
03:40:56,430 --> 03:40:57,090
He's right.

3471
03:40:57,090 --> 03:40:59,450
It'll make me a whole man.

3472
03:40:59,690 --> 03:41:01,290
I don't need no woman for that.

3473
03:41:02,430 --> 03:41:03,990
All I need is my pork bun.

3474
03:41:05,910 --> 03:41:07,870
Pork buns will never betray me.

3475
03:41:08,910 --> 03:41:11,070
They'll be there for me no matter what.

3476
03:41:12,170 --> 03:41:14,690
The bow vendor would never hurt me.

3477
03:41:17,990 --> 03:41:18,810
That's right.

3478
03:41:20,230 --> 03:41:22,870
Not a fetish for him.

3479
03:41:24,490 --> 03:41:24,910
Alright.

3480
03:41:25,350 --> 03:41:25,590
Alright.

3481
03:41:26,030 --> 03:41:26,550
Winston.

3482
03:41:27,530 --> 03:41:28,010
Thanks.

3483
03:41:28,870 --> 03:41:29,570
It's fucking great.

3484
03:41:29,750 --> 03:41:30,710
But you're on my side.

3485
03:41:33,330 --> 03:41:34,550
We've been waiting for you.

3486
03:41:35,450 --> 03:41:36,690
You guys smell something?

3487
03:41:38,070 --> 03:41:38,650
I don't know what.

3488
03:41:39,610 --> 03:41:40,270
The fourth one?

3489
03:41:40,390 --> 03:41:41,170
It's like sexy.

3490
03:41:41,390 --> 03:41:42,090
Oh, sure.

3491
03:41:42,390 --> 03:41:42,650
Huh?

3492
03:41:43,110 --> 03:41:44,590
You know what happens to rat sway?

3493
03:41:45,590 --> 03:41:46,890
I'm not a rat.

3494
03:41:48,290 --> 03:41:51,230
Conroy gave me all the details when he was helping me out on that minimum.

3495
03:41:51,370 --> 03:41:51,850
Whoa!

3496
03:41:52,710 --> 03:41:53,650
You're so sad.

3497
03:41:54,210 --> 03:41:55,930
Who the fuck do you think you are?

3498
03:41:56,010 --> 03:41:56,230
Huh?

3499
03:41:57,090 --> 03:41:59,970
You come in out of nowhere and suddenly our guys start to get arrested?

3500
03:42:01,030 --> 03:42:02,970
He ran it out, Popstar, Winston.

3501
03:42:03,310 --> 03:42:04,150
I know he did!

3502
03:42:04,350 --> 03:42:05,250
All you gotta do to run!

3503
03:42:05,550 --> 03:42:07,010
This motherfucker right here is a snitch!

3504
03:42:08,310 --> 03:42:09,410
Is that right, Ming?

3505
03:42:10,270 --> 03:42:11,490
For you fucking wrath.

3506
03:42:11,850 --> 03:42:12,870
I sent you to Popstar.

3507
03:42:13,230 --> 03:42:14,030
But now he's in jail!

3508
03:42:14,130 --> 03:42:14,330
Yeah?

3509
03:42:14,750 --> 03:42:16,290
And who stands to gain the most from that?

3510
03:42:17,190 --> 03:42:19,690
You're gonna take over Popstar's whole ketamine racket now.

3511
03:42:19,990 --> 03:42:21,130
No more scraps for you.

3512
03:42:22,490 --> 03:42:24,250
You'll supply the whole city with drugs.

3513
03:42:24,630 --> 03:42:25,430
You and Dog Eyes.

3514
03:42:25,990 --> 03:42:26,670
Popstar's gone.

3515
03:42:27,090 --> 03:42:28,290
You're still dealing, aren't you?

3516
03:42:28,690 --> 03:42:30,130
So who's supplying you?

3517
03:42:31,650 --> 03:42:32,770
That's a golden deagle.

3518
03:42:33,170 --> 03:42:33,810
Is it one shot?

3519
03:42:34,390 --> 03:42:35,790
Actually, listen to this asshole.

3520
03:42:36,270 --> 03:42:36,710
He's a rat.

3521
03:42:37,010 --> 03:42:37,870
He's a fucking rat.

3522
03:42:38,030 --> 03:42:39,070
He's a fucking rat.

3523
03:42:39,870 --> 03:42:41,410
He's still looking for that bastard orange.

3524
03:42:41,550 --> 03:42:42,750
I mean, where's that?

3525
03:42:43,070 --> 03:42:44,450
Oh, he's a dirty fucking thing.

3526
03:42:46,070 --> 03:42:49,490
Oh, my God.

3527
03:42:52,660 --> 03:42:54,780
Speech 100 right there.

3528
03:42:57,080 --> 03:42:57,340
Oh, God.

3529
03:42:57,400 --> 03:42:58,100
It was one shot.

3530
03:42:58,180 --> 03:42:58,520
Look at that.

3531
03:42:58,640 --> 03:42:59,480
He disposed a gun.

3532
03:43:00,180 --> 03:43:16,900

3534
03:43:41,410 --> 03:43:42,570
He was a full-on.

3535
03:43:43,550 --> 03:43:44,470
He was a UZ.

3536
03:43:51,090 --> 03:43:52,350
Oh, his PTSD.

3537
03:43:53,310 --> 03:43:53,570

3538
03:44:01,090 --> 03:44:01,550
Okay.

3539
03:44:02,210 --> 03:44:04,050
Apostle murder in the race scene.

3540
03:44:04,170 --> 03:44:05,410
Let's talk.

3541
03:44:07,510 --> 03:44:07,790
Alright.

3542
03:44:08,170 --> 03:44:09,270
Where are my surveillance?

3543
03:44:09,550 --> 03:44:10,490
Do I have anything else?

3544
03:44:11,770 --> 03:44:12,530
I don't have this.

3545
03:44:13,850 --> 03:44:14,290
Oh.

3546
03:44:15,190 --> 03:44:17,390
Nothing else is going on on my cam.

3547
03:44:19,270 --> 03:44:20,250
Yeah, he's so...

3548
03:44:20,270 --> 03:44:22,210

3549
03:44:24,430 --> 03:44:25,750
He talked to children.

3550
03:44:26,230 --> 03:44:28,130
I think it's okay that he's dead.

3551
03:44:28,510 --> 03:44:31,430
Wait, I don't think you should feel any guilt about that.

3552
03:44:31,890 --> 03:44:32,890
Not gonna lie.

3553
03:44:33,310 --> 03:44:39,330
You should definitely not feel any guilt on that guy dying.

3554
03:44:43,990 --> 03:44:45,190
