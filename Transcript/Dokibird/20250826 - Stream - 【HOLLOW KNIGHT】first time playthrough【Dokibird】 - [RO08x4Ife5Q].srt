1
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,600
Hello, oh my gosh, I sound like a dying cat right now.

2
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,880
Hello, hello, hello, everybody.

3
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,180
I just, I literally actually just woke up at 1220.

4
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,120
So I was like, oh, I was like, okay, brush teeth, brush teeth, turn PC on.

5
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,260
Heat food, get PC on.

6
00:04:00,740 --> 00:05:30,360
uh so been um i'm like all over the place right now my mind is still turning on right now um it is uh still revving up it's like i'm rubbing the engine at the moment so my mind is very very very slow because i'm still waking up um anyway good morning everyone sorry i had to do a little pop good morning everyone for those oh here's a little Laura for those who are new here um I don't burp instead of burping I do a pop I don't know why I I think like um I think because like my parents um were like burping is very rude and disgusting so because of that and I also personally was like oh burping is also like oh burping sounds gross so I taught myself at a very like burping i expel my gases by popping so if you ever hear me go like that that's my burp i don't i don't know i i don't know how i don't know how i train my body to do that uh so if you ever heard me do little pops and so that's just me expelling gas uh no it works yes I have not burped in years.

7
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,960
That doesn't sound healthy.

8
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,200
I don't know.

9
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,780
I don't know.

10
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:53,300
It's like when you're, you know, when you're younger, you're like, okay, also like when I was younger, this was not like something my parents made me think.

11
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,480
I just thought that sneezing was also really great.

12
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:21,500
gross so when i was younger i would hold my nose and then so i wouldn't do like and then because like i didn't want like expel the the the mucus and stuff everywhere so i would hold my nose when i sneeze when i was younger but that's really that's actually really bad for you no that is really bad for and i stopped when i got older i stopped doing it because i was like wait that's so bad

13
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:39,080
But when I was younger, when I was younger, I used to do that because I was like, ooh, I don't want to get mucus all over my hands or like I don't want to get mucus like all over my face and everything.

14
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,660
So, so I used to do that a lot when I was a little kid.

15
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,840
But I now, obviously, when I got older, I was thinking, wait, isn't that bad for my body?

16
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,200
And then I just like, I embraced my sneezes.

17
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,060
I will never embrace my burps.

18
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,940
I, like, no, that's banished from Doki Land.

19
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,760
That is outlawed in my world.

20
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:15,800
And I think pops are just a lot cuter in general in terms of, like, for me, I just think pops are just a lot better.

21
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,280
Like, it's just more, for me, it's like, that's right.

22
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:53,110
burping wise that's wrong that ain't right that's disgusting get out of here i mean you guys can for me i just think me burping is like just like i just find me burping is just pretty good so that's why i don't do it um and i just uh and i just trained my body to just go pop pop um anyway What was I gonna,

23
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,230
uh, uh, what was I, I mean, it's your, your body.

24
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,090
I don't control your body.

25
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:10,510
If I could, I would, but if I, if I could pass a law where burping is outlawed, I would, but obviously I can't do that.

26
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,950
Because, oh, Doki, that's so, that's wrong.

27
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,790
That's like being a dictator, apparently.

28
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,110
Even though I just want what's right for your body.

29
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,810
But, oh, apparently I'm a bad guy for trying to control burping.

30
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,130
Literally 1984.

31
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,570
Anyway.

32
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,370
We are going to be playing Hollow Knight today.

33
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,230
And this is actually...

34
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,190
Sorry if I'm a brainer.

35
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,770
So maybe if I'm like stumbling on words today.

36
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,170
Or like struggling to find...

37
00:08:51,670 --> 00:09:22,270
words right now because I am uh I am EP it takes me like one hour to warm up my my brain uh but anyway we're gonna be playing Hollow Knight today and this is actually my very first time ever playing a true Metrovania I never grew up with Metroid like I said because I never grew up with Nintendo games other than Pokemon because uh my dad was like uh Nintendo's are for pussies so I I never grew up with like any Metro type games.

38
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:38,950
Never played Hololight because I think when Hololight came out, I was either, I don't remember when Hololight, okay, when Hololight came out, but I think either I was too busy with my studies back then before I got, um, before I got sucked back into gaming,

39
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,890
or it was when, um, it was when I was only playing multiplayer games.

40
00:09:44,050 --> 00:11:07,090
So I never played Hololight and then everyone always judges me for never, having never experiencing hollow night um by that time oh 2017 i don't even remember i don't remember where i was at at that time because either i was too busy playing multiplayer games or i was too busy studying it was one or the other um and i said and then in my chat you guys me chaguns were like yoki when will you ever play hollow night and then i laughed at you guys and was like whenever silk song announces the release date because i thought you know that would be like I don't know seven more years you know I'd say that I would throw that statement everywhere I go like what about holiday and I'm like ha ha whenever silk song announces a release date you know it's like oh whenever pigs fly and and and then last week they announced the release date and it would be like and silk sock releases next week so you know i would i thought you know um i would have much more time to play holo night because i looked up

41
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:26,810
how long to complete holo night and then they're like you know if you're like almost an optimal gamer who has experience with metrovania it would take you around 27 hours So then I was thinking, all right, if we convert the 27 hours into Doki hours, that would be like 40 hours,

42
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:27,410
maybe.

43
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:36,990
So, because I'm like, what's the conversion of regular gamer hours to Doki hours?

44
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,530
So I'm just like, okay, we're not finishing Hollow Knight before Silk Song releases.

45
00:11:42,530 --> 00:12:03,410
So, what I'm planning on doing is, what I'm planning on doing is that we're going to play Hollow Knight, and in the day Silksaw releases, we'll play Silksaw on launch, and then we go back to Hollow Knight, and then continue part two of Silksaw whenever I finish Hollow Knight,

46
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:34,110
but I still, I still want to play Silksaw on release, just so, so at least I'll like have the the whole night experience and then um and then like we go in and then we just go back like it's just like you know just just have a glimpse of the future for a little bit you know when your time travel forward to see like what's the future like and then go back and then nothing changes in the future because um it relies on the past uh so things will be fine

47
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,030
Spoiled?

48
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,430
Spoiled on what?

49
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,350
Like, it doesn't, man.

50
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,150
It's fine.

51
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,210
Like, I feel like I won't even understand.

52
00:12:47,770 --> 00:13:03,090
Like, I'll look at it, and then I'll be like, I'll be like, I don't, I'll look at, it'll be even better, because then when I get to that part, in Hollow Knight, I'll be like, I'll be like, oh, so that's what it meant in Silk Song.

53
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,850
It's okay.

54
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,190
Everything will be fine.

55
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,810
won't even understand if I do get spoiled.

56
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:25,150
If we convert it to Doki, the Doki brain, it will most likely mean I just won't understand if I do get spoiled in the sequel.

57
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,090
It's the Doki logic.

58
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,790
Crippy, they gave it a super chat, thank you, thank you.

59
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,550
super random question.

60
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,110
I'm going to get my nails done for Vexpo next week in your colors.

61
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,530
I was just wondering what pattern the colors are in.

62
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,450
Wait, what pattern the colors are in?

63
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,050
You mean like, I mean, go wild.

64
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,990
You just do like my main outfit and just go wild.

65
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,430
I'm pretty sure it's going to look amazing in general.

66
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,350
And I bet you're, I bet it's going to be like super creative.

67
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,450
I guess, I mean, it was for my normal.

68
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,530
I love nail art.

69
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,270
Nail art is very...

70
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,010
I don't like getting my nails done, but I love looking at nail art.

71
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:23,050
The reason why I don't like getting my nails done is that it is, it looks very...

72
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,830
It is painful and it looks very painful.

73
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,010
So because you know how you're like scraping under...

74
00:14:30,010 --> 00:15:13,730
For those who never got their nails done, for the people out there that don't get their nails done, um you know how they have to like scrape underneath the uh the nail they have to scrape underneath the skin where your nails connect to your finger and clean it and that's also how they and they like insert it under your skin a little bit um and that is so scary yeah the the cuticle yeah and yeah so like some nails they do that so that's why like I don't get my nails done like I've done it once and I was like no

75
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,190
but but you get pretty nails

76
00:15:28,450 --> 00:16:02,510
you get but the nails are really pretty um and and because of that um I love looking at it like power to you guys um for able to do it but power to you but I don't even get my ears pierced so um because I was I've been really okay the reason why I don't get my ears pierced is one I'm always scared of the pain of uh of them um of them like putting a hole in my ear to ear infections.

77
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:12,350
I always hear horror stories of my friends getting ear infections from like a bad earring or something or something just going, getting into the hole.

78
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,510
And so I was like, I do not want to, I don't want to go through that.

79
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,010
And apparently it's like, it's so painful too when you have an ear infection where the piercing is.

80
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,530
So yeah, and they close up too.

81
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,390
So you have to like punch a hole in it again.

82
00:16:30,070 --> 00:17:42,490
get my ears pierced um and that is also why like i don't get my nails done because if i can't fucking handle ear piercings i cannot handle them fucking sticking under my nails like i can't i can't handle that i yeah so a little fun fact for those people who don't get their nails done and when you see all those pretty nails they went those those women went through went through a lot to make them look pretty and they're also very expensive too and another reason is also like they're more fragile yeah i mean i mean you could just use clip-ons but they're not the same it's not the same but um um but um and when you if you have like the real real like the you know the real nails getting done where it's literally in your fingers in your fucking fingers um and the longer too you know you know how like the nails are longer uh so if your nail gets caught on something

83
00:17:47,640 --> 00:18:02,580
it is not okay new nightmare unlock yeah if your nail gets caught on something it's in your finger just that

84
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:14,300
Yeah, so that's why can't we shut up you like my nail now

85
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:30,000
Because the reason why I'm like I fear that a lot is because it happened to my mom once I was I was seven

86
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,620
So now I have to live through that trauma, guys.

87
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,980
It's been years, and I still think about it.

88
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,260
I was seven when that happened.

89
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:58,160
So now I have to live through that trauma, the generational trauma of like never getting my nails done.

90
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,320
I witnessed it.

91
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,700
I got it done once.

92
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,360
That was enough for me.

93
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,140
Why are you making us suffer with you?

94
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,020
So you can live with that fear, too.

95
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,480
Because I was safe from...

96
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,860
I'm just trying to make you guys safe, guys.

97
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,640
I'm just trying to give you guys safety advice.

98
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,040
It's like how...

99
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,800
The reason why we have insane fear of...

100
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:40,440
The reason why like some of us have like phobias or like fear of like, you know, when you're young, you're like, why do you fear spiders?

101
00:19:40,680 --> 00:20:01,820
Even though, you know, if you never encountered a spider or like a snake or something, then as a baby, but you're still fear it is because like millions, I don't know, hundreds of thousands of years ago, our ancestors were instilled that fear in us because they would kill us because it's survival of the fittest,

102
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:21,640
like the instinct, you know, these animals would actually kill us so that fear is like instilled into us so i'm instilling this fear onto you guys for your safety it's survival of the fittest i'm trying to give make you feel safe

103
00:20:29,500 --> 00:21:03,640
um but yeah anyway um okay what okay minutes all right i was gonna give you guys another story time but i realized it's hollow night time we gotta get as much done as possible uh i tell you this because i want you to be safe it's like i'm like that that character from rapunza where i lock you up in the tower and be like don't worry nothing will hurt you now a healthy community has the same lifetime trauma Exactly.

104
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,440
Thank you for the super chat, Maddie.

105
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,180
Thank you.

106
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,100
Thank you.

107
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:07,960
All right.

108
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,680
It's hallowed night time.

109
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,320
I'm just looking out for you guys.

110
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,970
But yeah, honestly, like, you guys, like, people who don't get their nails, someone never know that it's actually in your nails.

111
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,850
You think like they're just like, oh, you're just painting.

112
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,410
You're just like painting your nails into these beautiful nail art.

113
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,090
You're painting it on like, you're not painting it on your actual nail.

114
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:47,150
You're painting it on like a little acrylic thing And then you're inserting it into your finger.

115
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,810
That shit is hardcore.

116
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,650
Why do you keep talking about?

117
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,210
It's that?

118
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:05,690
No, no, it's not actually on your finger the nail art Is on an acrylic and then they insert it in your finger

119
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,130
So stop talking about it's not core.

120
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,650
It's just getting your nails done.

121
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,310
That's what it means when women are like, I'm going to get my nails done.

122
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,350
Like, bro.

123
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,630
Like, okay, played the game.

124
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,470
All right.

125
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,850
That's it.

126
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,690
I'm getting me mad at that.

127
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,010
Happy thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

128
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,270
Gourum, my comfort nails.

129
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,430
All right, oh wait, do I need a, let me look at the settings real quick.

130
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,450
Let's see, show achievement.

131
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,710
No, we don't need that audio.

132
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,090
All right, sound guy.

133
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:06,490
You enjoy talking about certain, I like putting, I mean, I've never had issues with putting contact lenses on or taking them off.

134
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,450
It's just, oh, that's it.

135
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,370
I never had any issues about Ovid growing up.

136
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,650
I don't even have to look in the mirror.

137
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,270
I can just take it out without having to look in the mirror.

138
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,690
Like, I just, I don't know.

139
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,290
I just know where it is.

140
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,410
Alright, let's see.

141
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,930
I just want to make sure I got everything in.

142
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,750
Particle Explorer quality.

143
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:33,550
Low.

144
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,610
Frame rate cap.

145
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,390
What is the cap, though?

146
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,430
That's fine.

147
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,630
It's not an FPS.

148
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,950
I don't really have to worry.

149
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,090
Okay, we're going to use controller.

150
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,110
Alright, sound guy.

151
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,370
Let me know if everything's okay for sound.

152
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,150
Alright, start game.

153
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:01,630
I actually have no idea what the story is for Hollow Knight.

154
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,130
I just know they're all bugs.

155
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,370
That's everything I know about Hollow Knight.

156
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,850
They're all just bugs.

157
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:46,580
in wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret for none could tame our savage souls yet you challenge yet you the challenge meant under palace watch you taught we change based instance were redeemed a world you give to bug and beasts as they had never dreamed i love poetry um when i was younger uh when i was younger um i would do like uh there would be like poetry You read up poems to the class slash school,

158
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,840
and I love doing that.

159
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,620
Because you have to be so expressive with poetry.

160
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,600
I hate writing poetry, though.

161
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,540
I just love reading it.

162
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,680
I always, like, I always participate in any, like, poetry reading contest.

163
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,360
As a kid.

164
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,660
When I got older, I just started hating it.

165
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,520
I just, like, stopped reading, I guess.

166
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,060
It's a bit loud.

167
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,760
I just stopped reading when I was older.

168
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,620
When I got older.

169
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,360
My favorite poem.

170
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,540
I'm trying to remember.

171
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,680
They're very childish.

172
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,580
A lot of my favorite poems are very childish poems.

173
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,440
Because, you know, I like...

174
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
I was reading poetry when I was...

175
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,040
was like, in first to fourth grade.

176
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:54,930
Yay!

177
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,700
That's me!

178
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,540
I'm John Hollow Knight.

179
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,080
Does it, will it give me instructions later?

180
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,820
Yeah.

181
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
I know this is from the fame rate cap or anything.

182
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,750
Trying to see if I'm lagging at all.

183
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:20,550
Okay.

184
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,490
Okay.

185
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,410
All right.

186
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,510
I'm John Knight.

187
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,590
Oh, she's actually playing Hollow Knight.

188
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,710
What's that supposed to mean?

189
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,690
Yes, I...

190
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,030
What?

191
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,270
It's on my waiting room.

192
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,250
Of course it's on.

193
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,110
I'm actually playing Hollow Knight.

194
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,290
What else would I be playing?

195
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:50,990
What?

196
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:59,930

197
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,730
Maybe it's...

198
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,150
Oh.

199
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,410
Okay.

200
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,930
It's literally, like, full screen.

201
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,010
I'm going to put it on full screen.

202
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,110
It does...

203
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,630
Oh, my God.

204
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,410
I can't...

205
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,330
Okay, there we go.

206
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,010
Yes.

207
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,110
Wait, no.

208
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:13,790
No.

209
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,170
No.

210
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,490
Go to full screen.

211
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,270
No.

212
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,270
Go to full screen.

213
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,730
Why does it keep jumping?

214
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:19,810
Full screen.

215
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,530
Oh, my God.

216
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,350
Oh, my God.

217
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:23,610
Okay.

218
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,310
Full screen.

219
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,510
Why?

220
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,210
Full screen.

221
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:31,970
Why?

222
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,050
Why can't I play on full screen?

223
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,690
Full screen.

224
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,250
Why?

225
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,750
It's forcing me off.

226
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,370
It's actually forcing me off of full screen.

227
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,450
Every time I put it on full screen, it's like, do you mean borderless?

228
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,190
No!

229
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,530
I mean, full...

230
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,570
Okay, never mind.

231
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,110
It's not letting me play full screen, guys.

232
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:50,710
why i i i don't know why it it's i i don't know why it's i i don't know why it's actually forcing itself off of four full screen that's crazy it's it's like physically not allowing me to play on full screen every time i put it on they're like no okay there you go we fixed okay there we did it oh my god no you don't understand the game itself was like please please I did not consent to be played on full screen stop it was actually fighting against me holy fuck that was crazy like someone stop her she's forced me on full screen.

233
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,970
Are we trying FrameCat back on?

234
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,210
It feels more fluid, though.

235
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:56,910
I don't know.

236
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:58,630
Where am I?

237
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,170
So what makes a Metro... Yeah, I beat the first boss, guys.

238
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,490
What makes it a Metrovania?

239
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,150
Metrovania.

240
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,730
I've never played one before, so I don't really know that genre.

241
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,270
I'm just gonna vandalize everything, I guess.

242
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,510
Harry Beans, these words are for you alone.

243
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:44,770
on this point you enter uh the land of king and creator step across this threshold and obey our laws bd platform with lots of zones everything is connected oh so it's just backtracking all right guys it's time to um on this playthrough maybe we'll finally learn how to read a map because like i feel like if i don't like we're the 40 hour prediction might turn into a 60 hour prediction

244
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:54,730
There was the last and only civilization, the eternal kingdom, Holonest.

245
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,010
Oh, is that my house?

246
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,870
Since I am John Holonite?

247
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,570
Am I the prince of Holonest?

248
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,270
I, dokey, I consent, computer, I consent, game.

249
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,650
I don't, isn't there someone you forgot to ask?

250
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,810
JL, thank you for the super chat.

251
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,150
Thank you, thank you.

252
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,410
Let's leave, oh, okay.

253
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,770
Wait, can I just...

254
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:44,310

255
00:31:48,830 --> 00:32:19,990
there's only me left to offer welcome our towns falling quiet you see oh my god you're like you're like lonely george that turtle someone quit give we gotta repopulate the world the other residents they all disappeared headed down that well one by one into the caverns below used to be there was a great cat kingdom beneath our town it's long fell to ruin yet it still With the lower enlightenment,

256
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,470
that darkness seemed to promise all things.

257
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,010
I'm sure you too seek your dreams down there.

258
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,790
Well, watch out.

259
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,590
It's a sticky air that fills the place.

260
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,590
Creatures turn mad and travelers are robbed of their memories.

261
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,870
Perhaps dreams aren't such great things after all.

262
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,750
Oh hey, let's rest.

263
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,050
I guess that's like a safe point, right?

264
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,970
A safe point slash yeah?

265
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,790
Keep him company.

266
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,970
And it's fine, he can just die alone.

267
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,270
For all your mapping supplies, we will be opening soon.

268
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:54,810
Okay.

269
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,270
You think they'll open, guys?

270
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,050
Oh, there's the well.

271
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,290
What if I don't go there?

272
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,390
What's over here?

273
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,570
Are these bug graves?

274
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,690
That's right, vandalizing.

275
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:14,710
Vandalism.

276
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,290
A stone door with a simple lock.

277
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,670
All right.

278
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,270
Will I be able to dash soon?

279
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,850
Unless dashing is, like, an ability I earn later.

280
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:24,970
Alright.

281
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,410
Down the way I go.

282
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,230
I don't want to be alone with lonely George.

283
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,530
Okay.

284
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,090
Forgotten crossroads.

285
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,390
I'm a menace to society.

286
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,350
Wait, am I a bad person?

287
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,190
Like, all these people are just existing.

288
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,050
Wait.

289
00:33:49,450 --> 00:34:12,450
I like I don't know they don't seem to be bothering me and I'm like fuck you I don't like your kind like yeah maybe because I'm thinking like wait like what did they do to me why am I murdering all these bugs like I literally spawn in Just a murder.

290
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,490
Me.

291
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:21,370
I feel like I literally I spawn in just to kill them.

292
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,130
Alright.

293
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:25,390
Yeah.

294
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,730
I got hurt them before they hurt me.

295
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,050
You don't understand.

296
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,430
Like how they make little poop noises.

297
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,110
When they die.

298
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,510
Because like you know when you're dead.

299
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,870
Oh, I can't do that yet.

300
00:34:43,030 --> 00:35:00,730
I can't wall jump when you when you die like you expel everything out So it's just like real life They're buying Yeah, it's like when you Um, it's like okay, so There's also another fear of mine

301
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:08,530
Um, but it's also for those here's a little fun fact guys.

302
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:13,570
I told this fun fact before but for all these new people We did consent to this fun fact.

303
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,710
When you give birth, you poop a little.

304
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,230
Because you're pushing.

305
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,190
That's not very fun.

306
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,930
Yeah, do not again.

307
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,370
What are you?

308
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,670
I guess you're going to be stuck there for the rest of your life.

309
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,420
Because I can't, I haven't learned how to dash yet.

310
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,090
Somebody take away her full screen windows.

311
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,290
My wife just had a baby.

312
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,910
I can confirm it is true.

313
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,070
Is that common knowledge?

314
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,490
No, it's not.

315
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,590
So yeah, they all see you pooping.

316
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:43,060

317
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,100
All right, nice.

318
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh, there's a thing pointing down.

319
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,700
But let me see what's over here first.

320
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,840
All right, nice.

321
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,400
Okay, where's my map?

322
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,660
Do I get to see where my map is at any point?

323
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,880
Down I go.

324
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,840
I don't know where I am.

325
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,800
Oh, a bako.

326
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,500
I can't go there yet.

327
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,640
You have to find him?

328
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,220
Oh my god, there's the Metroid in my Metrovania.

329
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,080
Oh my god, please, go up.

330
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,040
John Hollow Knight, go up.

331
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,820
I need, like, a dash in the map.

332
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,320
What's this?

333
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,520
Oh, that seems nice.

334
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:33,980
Hello.

335
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:34,780
Oh!

336
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,100
I'm sorry, I was giving you a love tap.

337
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,520
I didn't know!

338
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,980
I was just trying to give you a love tap!

339
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,520
Okay.

340
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,000
I don't fucking know.

341
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,540
I'm just...

342
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,080
Tap.

343
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,300
Tap.

344
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,660
Tap.

345
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,840
See, he likes it.

346
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,940
He's giving me a love tap in return.

347
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,420
That can't be a boss.

348
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,700
He just won...

349
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,300
Yeah, exactly.

350
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,900
I'm giving him some taps.

351
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:43,580
she's crazy I just shimmy back guys that's not yes please you know what I did when I fought him I went right and then I went left yeah that has to be just a big that kid does not feel like a boss fight oh oh my god joking gaming and then I get hit by him.

352
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,860
The smaller they are, the harder it is, apparently for me.

353
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,400
You know what?

354
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,000
This game is so easy.

355
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,540
Look at that.

356
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,900
Okay.

357
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,700
I think that's like the pattern to kill for them.

358
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,080
It's just you go left and then you go right.

359
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,300
And then occasionally you do a little jump too.

360
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,900
You feel a little quirky.

361
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,460
Hello.

362
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,760
Anybody here?

363
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,120

Now that's the Hollow Knight I want.

366
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,980
A giant bird just hatches and just eats everybody.

367
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,620
Yeah, but it's because like what other egg would it be?

368
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,540
There's no way these bugs can make an egg that big.

369
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,900
Never right again.

370
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,300

373
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,360
Oh, I went back.

374
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,880
Oh, I came back from my Metrovania.

375
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,120
Okay, I guess that means I go left now.

376
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,760
Or did I go left last time?

377
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,700
I'm already lost, guys.

378
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,220
I don't remember where I was.

379
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,300
I don't remember where have I been.

380
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,300
Alright.

381
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,540
Oh, I should heal.

382
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,240
I need to pay attention to my health.

383
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,240
Who's that?

384
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,020
Oh, hello.

385
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,540

386
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,800

387
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,420
Oh, wait.

388
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:29,900

00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,860

396
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,360

434
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,720
If you're not the head for directions, I suggest purchasing a compass from my wife, Azelta.

435
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:30,580
She's now opening a new map shop in Dirt Mounds, sharing all sorts of useful things to wanderers like yourself.

436
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,240
No, you didn't sell some of my old maps from town at the time.

437
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,240
I'll pop back to see her whenever I finish mapping an area.

438
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,800
She's always so excited to see me.

439
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,260
That nerd is less single than you are.

440
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,820
All right, we'll be the judge of how hot his wife is.

441
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,300
We'll be the judge of the hotness of the wife.

442
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,000
The moment I figure out how to get out of here.

443
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,320

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:05,760

00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,950

451
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,430

Wait.

469
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,510

Okay, I think it's above me, I'm pretty sure.

474
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,690
And I can kill these guys again for free money.

475
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,010
Because I spent it on Darth Maul.

476
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:41,850
Or not Darth Maul.

477
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:45,450
I spent it on this stupid scam of a map.

478
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,450
This map doesn't even tell me where I am.

479
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,610
Where's the you are here, Marky?

480
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,100
Oh, oh, I need double- I need Dash for that to save him.

481
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,620
That's my $20 paycheck right there.

482
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:04,600
Yeah?

483
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,140
What the fuck is it?

484
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,320
Yeah, I need to go up.

485
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,540
I need to go to the surface world for my compass.

486
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,200
But I need to figure out how to get to the surface world.

487
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,540
Okay, this is not how.

488
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,220
I'm so lost.

489
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,200
I don't need to go out and ask for directions, Laura.

490
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,920
Ask the locals, come on, do you ask the locals for directions?

491
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,660
No, I can figure this out.

492
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,560
This is my car, and I will figure it out.

493
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,080
Where am I?

494
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,720
If I look at it a little harder, I'll know where I am.

495
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Just give me a sec.

496
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,060
Okay, maybe this way.

497
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,580
Well, okay.

498
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,640
Okay, maybe it's up top.

499
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,880
Maybe it's like the other door.

500
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,540
Oh my god, let me...

501
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,240
These enemies are so annoying.

502
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,600
This is why I tank it.

503
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,620
Okay, not.

504
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,740
Not now!

505
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,880
Okay.

506
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,240
Okay.

507
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,880
It'd be like here.

508
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,460
You said it.

509
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,620
Is this where...

510
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,660
Here it is?

511
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,040
Oh, there it is.

512
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,340
See, I told you I can figure it out.

513
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,200
Alright, now to judge how hot the wife is.

514
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,200
Like, like, she lives here.

515
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,360
That's where she lives.

516
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,420
Oh my!

517
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,900
How?

518
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,040
How the fuck did he snag her?

519
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,380
He must...

520
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,360
Like...

521
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,460
Oh my god.

522
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,860
Ma'am, can I...

523
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,660
Do you know where his wife is?

524
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,220
Because, like, obviously it can't be you.

525
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,700
Oh my god.

526
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,520
Maybe he has assets that we were not aware of.

527
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,400
Like...

528
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,240
The nerds got the risk.

529
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,520
I'll come to buy a map, have you?

530
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,280
And certainly my husband used to be dealing with.

531
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,220
But what a surprise.

532
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,120
He's headed down below.

533
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,520
He'll pop back occasionally to deliver new maps for the store.

534
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,200
But I do wish he spends a little more time up here.

535
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,420
I'm not much interested in retailing myself.

536
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,340
Oh, you're...

537
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,420
Are you lonely?

538
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,340
Don't worry, it's Hilda.

539
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,160
I have plenty of time to keep you company.

540
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:59,800

Hello.

542
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,920
Bar Panada.

543
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:04,580
Alright.

544
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,480
I purchased the compass.

545
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,240
Open the charm menu whilst it resting.

546
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,200
Where the fuck is up?

547
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,400
Oh, the bench is over here.

548
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,040
So in the end, he's the one in the wrong.

549
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,040
Okay.

550
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,780
To equip a charm, press this.

551
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,060
Okay.

552
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,600
No, it will not be more fun than you.

553
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,000
It will do.

554
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,140
not be more fun.

555
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,520
Thank you for that super chat.

556
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,020
Thank you.

557
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,680
Thank you.

558
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:35,920
Just because there's a goalkeeper doesn't mean you can't score VLX.

559
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,420
Thank you for the super chat.

560
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:37,820
Thank you.

561
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:38,720
Thank you.

562
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:45,200
Look, all I'm saying is that she's up there and he's down there.

563
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,520
Yeah, you want the quill too eventually?

564
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:23,780

00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:29,400
Ah!

567
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,140
Fuck.

568
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:35,760
Right now I'm broke and I'm trying to rob these people for their life savings.

569
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,590
Yeah.

570
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,530
I'm not a bad guy.

571
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,650
I'm just desperate.

572
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,850
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

573
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,530
To steal someone else's woman.

574
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:57,490
Alright.

575
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:31,830
The Pilgrim's Raid Travelers of Holiness Descends toward Through verdant wilds and fungal grows To city at the kingdom's heart They all wishes shall be granted All truths revealed You're not evil You're just broke Exactly Beek-a-boo Oh so you're just a pussy Kate Ha ha ha So you're just a fucking pussy?

576
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:34,550
He's like...

577
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,610
He's like those people that like...

578
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,730
He's like those people that can...

579
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:46,350
That's like all bark and no bite because at the moment you get close to them they just run away.

580
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:50,370
And that's not me and I'm not one of those people by the way.

581
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,020
All right, um...

582
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,880
I think there was something down there above me.

583
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,480
I'm trying to remember.

584
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,440
Okay, now there was another area below.

585
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,020
Oh, shit.

586
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,640
That's an accident.

587
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,060
There was, like, another entrance over here.

588
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,940
From what I remember.

589
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,060
Yeah.

590
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,240
Over there.

591
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,560
Okay.

592
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,400
I mean, at least I'm farming money.

593
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,020
Backtracking it.

594
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,280
Just gotta remember.

595
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,980
Figure out how to get there.

596
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,600
God damn it, okay.

597
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,760
Okay, at least I'm getting rid of these guys.

598
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,860
Okay, I jumped from this platform to the next.

599
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,700
Shit, okay, I jumped from this platform to the next.

600
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,440
Yeah.

601
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,660
Okay, guys, get away.

602
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,420
Get away!

603
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,520
Get away!

604
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,320
Bug be gone!

605
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,760

That's fine.

609
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,640
Worth it.

610
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,100
Now where am I?

611
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,560
Oh, wait.

612
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,840
Why doesn't this...

613
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,460
Have I been here before?

614
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,220
No, I have.

615
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,120
God damn it.

616
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:21,340

That's where the kids are.

662
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,540
It's just business.

663
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,200
All right.

664
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,540

01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,960
They got me good.

668
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,540
Alright, where have I not gotten?

669
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,220
I guess like, bottom?

670
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:49,070
Is it all the way down?

671
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:50,690
Yeah, it is.

672
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,030
The butt capitalism.

673
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,730
I can't believe it!

674
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,430
Fuck you, Cornelius!

675
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,450
Can never escape capitalism.

676
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,430
Not even in the bug world.

677
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:07,030
It's truly a bug's life.

678
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,660
Alright, I haven't been here.

679
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,560
But, this is free money.

680
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:16,520
Oh, shit, secret!

681
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,340
Okay, nice.

682
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,540
This has to be, like, someone's...

683
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,340
Like, they saved...

684
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:27,940
They...

685
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:31,540
It took this person 20 years to save up this stash, and I'm just here...

686
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,900
Like, casually robbing them.

687
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,680
All I'm saying is, if this is your life or anything, you should have hit it better.

688
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,220
Not my fault.

689
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,260
They can't hide your money better.

690
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,240
Should have went to that fucking bank.

691
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,920
Not my fault you don't trust the bank.

692
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,650
It's like those people that hide their money underneath their bed mattresses.

693
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:56,190
But yeah, finders keepers.

694
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:58,870
It's their home.

695
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,890
It is not their home.

696
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:02,190
Where is the security?

697
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:07,840
Wait, what?

698
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,660
Why did it lock me in?

699
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,360
There's the security.

700
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:19,860
Okay.

701
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:24,560
Oh.

702
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,560
I killed an entire family.

703
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,220
Yippee.

704
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,780
It's the final boss.

705
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,540
The final countdown.

706
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:38,800
Kill.

707
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,660
Thank you for the super chat.

708
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,020
Thank you.

709
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:41,700
Thank you.

710
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:46,460
That's rich come from something that doesn't lock your apartment store.

711
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,700
That's different.

712
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,360
I have a security dog.

713
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,860
As long as it's not a pretty woman, I'm fine.

714
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,660
My dog will do his job.

715
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,070
Did I go here yet?

716
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:07,570
Yeah, I did.

717
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:12,930
Okay, now I have $130 back.

718
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,090
Okay.

719
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:15,710
What's over here?

720
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,350
Oh, they're both at the same entrance.

721
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:20,610
I like that.

722
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,230
Wait, they're not.

723
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,370
Wait, this is different.

724
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,470
What's over here?

725
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:26,650
Oh my god, a bench?

726
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:27,490
Finally.

727
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,590
I feel like I haven't seen the fucking bench in forever.

728
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,370
This is a hot spring?

729
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,650
I should be burning alive.

730
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:39,390
It is.

731
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,320
Alright.

732
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,240
Am I going the right way?

733
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,560
Wait, give me a sec.

734
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:53,100
I got killed.

735
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:54,560
I got to steal his money.

736
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,220
real quick.

737
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:01,350
Glory, Story, Souls?

738
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:02,830
Do you mean the white stuff?

739
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,490
I should not call it white stuff.

740
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,470
I need to learn to...

741
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:14,850
I need to, like, use the Pogo move more.

742
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:21,420
Because I know...

743
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,360
I feel like that would be, like, super effective in battles.

744
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:29,720
Oh, shit.

745
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:31,960
Give me a sec.

746
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:32,700
Got a chance.

747
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,860
the white stuff.

748
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:38,980
There is...

749
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:40,740
I assume there's more money here.

750
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,820
No, it's just people for me to rob.

751
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,660
Which is technically money.

752
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,260
My little piggy banks.

753
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,900
Gotta break open the piggy bank.

754
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,000
What the fuck is that?

755
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,220
Am I fuck?

756
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,540
Like, wait, how do I...

757
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,500
Oh, okay.

758
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,700
Oh, there's a down.

759
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,440
Okay, I see it down.

760
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,140
I didn't see that hole there.

761
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:15,540
Alright, nice.

762
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,780
Is there anything above me?

763
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:22,560
Oh, whatever.

764
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,100
I'll just go this way first.

765
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,240
Alright.

766
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,020
I think there's a boss room above me, I assume?

767
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,920
I think, like, I think that looks like a boss room above me.

768
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,800
Knock knock Knock knock Who's here?

769
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:56,520

770
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:13,320
Well, since you won't let me in I'll just break everything around you I can't wait to get the dash I feel so slow No vandals allowed I'm angry now, I'm gonna break it up.

771
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,300
Oh, ow.

772
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,880
That's rude.

773
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,580
Only I'm allowed to kill.

774
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,060
Okay.

775
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,140
Oh, that restores my...

776
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,780
Oh, that's a soul thing.

777
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,240
Channeling the white stuff is what the map guys wiped.

778
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,120
Broken body.

779
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,220

Yay!

787
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,300
Still someone else's hidden stash.

788
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,240
And the secret was not as worth it as I thought.

789
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,380
Down here?

790
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:11,820
Another secret here?

791
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,260
Yeah, that's right.

792
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:20,880
It's his bug.

793
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:21,780
Oh, wait.

794
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,100
Is that a boss?

795
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:24,860
He has a name.

796
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:25,940
Oh, shit.

797
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:26,820
Oh, my God.

798
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,730
Oh, okay, that's on me.

799
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:37,130
I felt bad.

800
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:41,230
Like, do I hit him?

801
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:42,770
Oh, no, he'll just stop.

802
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,130
Okay.

803
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:48,710
I got confused, because I was like, will he stop?

804
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:52,910
Like, sir, please, if I let you hit me, would you, like, stop doing that?

805
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:54,730
Sir, this is not healthy.

806
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,770
Sir, please.

807
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:57,370
Take your anger out on something else.

808
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,790
Or more healthier things.

809
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,820
It's a mother.

810
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:06,820
It's a she.

811
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:12,140
Well, I guess then all their kids are gonna be orphans now.

812
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:16,550
Don't worry.

813
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:18,670
I'll let you meet your mother.

814
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:23,470
Guys, I'm not a bad person, right?

815
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:26,890
Right?

816
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,030
Alright.

817
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:33,270
dead orphans.

818
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,740
Look, it's survival of the fittest, guys.

819
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,120
It's just...

820
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,520
It's just simply survival of the fittest.

821
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,600
Natural selection.

822
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,880
Those bugs would have died anyway if I didn't intervene.

823
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,640
I'm just making sure they suffer less.

824
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,520
Oh, you wield your nail like a club.

825
01:10:59,300 --> 01:10:59,640
That's me.

826
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,580
How much deeper do we have to go?

827
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:02,940
Oh, what?

828
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,340
Who are you?

829
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,560
I see this old village.

830
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:10,700
What a strange dream to have led me down here.

831
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,500
If you hadn't found me, I don't think I've ever woken.

832
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,600
I'm sly.

833
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:18,380
Usually, I live an uneventful life up in Dirtmouth.

834
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,700
The air in these ruins doesn't create me, so I best be getting back.

835
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,940
You turn above, come and see me.

836
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,460
I'm probably the friendliest face left there.

837
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,340
I can thank you properly for your good deeds.

838
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,300
Alright, nice.

839
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,580
Now the elder has more friends.

840
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,060
If I support someone evil, am I evil?

841
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:44,640
Lucky for you, you're not supporting any evil person.

842
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,300
Thank you for the super chat, Luke.

843
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,380
Thank you, thank you.

844
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:54,240
Thank God you're not supporting anyone evil right now.

845
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,060
True.

846
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,940
Yeah, I'm lawful, good.

847
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,040
Wait, did I just kill all the people there?

848
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,340
Oh, there's nothing else here.

849
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,060
Yeah.

850
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:23,160
I know I haven't been here because all this stuff is still intact.

851
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,060
Wait, I'm... Yeah?

852
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,300
I don't know.

853
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,270
Yeah, there's nothing here.

854
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:42,850
And this is where...

855
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:44,470
Where was this again?

856
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:46,230
No.

857
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:50,410
I don't remember.

858
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:51,010
God damn it.

859
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:52,770
Where the fuck are the benches?

860
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:54,110
Awfully.

861
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:56,010
Yeah, awfully good of me.

862
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:56,330
Right?

863
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:58,450
You just had a little typo, right again?

864
01:12:58,790 --> 01:12:59,730
Thank you for the super chat.

865
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:00,170
Thank you.

866
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:00,770
Thank you.

867
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:12,030
Yep, I didn't get the updates in real time DLC.

868
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:13,210
God damn.

869
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:14,370
Fucking scammed.

870
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:20,280
Okay.

871
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,420
Oh my god.

872
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:23,500
Stupid children.

873
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:47,810
your or your dead orphans okay you gotta eliminate everybody in the bloodline so no one will get revenge on you i think the hardest part is just remembering where the benches are because i feel like i only found one bench in this entire run

876
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:35,190
Wait, I think I can afford the Benchmarkers, which is why, yeah, I need that, actually.

877
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:42,450
Okay, I'm gonna go get the, buy the Benchmarkers, buy the next DLC.

878
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,890
Okay, I just gotta go up.

879
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:51,350
Yeah, I can extort the dad later.

880
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,090
Wait, this is not correct?

881
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:57,910
I'm reading this map route?

882
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:58,750
No, okay, it's this way.

886
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,330
What the fuck is a cocoon?

887
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:14,970
Marks, shopkeepers, or any other you find on your travels.

888
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:17,170
Keep track of the...

889
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,330
What does the hot springs do?

890
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,250
Mark interesting spots.

891
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:23,210
Use markers.

892
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,950
You can use them to mark... Oh, okay.

893
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:27,230
I guess we'll do the vendor pin.

894
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,830
Oh, they're... Oh, they're temporary...

895
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:34,170
Okay.

896
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,590
Where are the cocoons, though?

897
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:38,170
Cancun's do?

898
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:50,970
Blue stuff?

899
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,650
Oh, they're the temporary HP.

900
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:58,770
Oh, wait, then what about... Oh, and Hot Springs restore... Oh, Hot Springs restore it all your HP.

901
01:16:58,870 --> 01:16:59,890
Okay, I don't need any of that.

902
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:01,370
Alright.

903
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:03,570
And then they said that...

904
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:05,810
What's his name?

905
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:07,830
The other guy.

906
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:10,450
Where's the...

907
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:12,910
The other guy's Skelly or whatever.

908
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,430
Does he live over here?

909
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:18,950
Does he live in the graveyard?

910
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:20,530
That's fucking depressing, bro.

911
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,090
Okay, he doesn't live in the graveyard.

912
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,350
Oh, it's on the left.

913
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:33,370
I was gonna be like, bro, I know, like, real estate is expensive, but it's pretty depressing to live next to the graveyard.

914
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:36,610
The other way there.

915
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:37,610
Oh, he's all the way here.

916
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:38,230
Okay.

917
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:41,410
Hello.

918
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:42,330
Hey, morning.

919
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:43,830
I know we meet again.

920
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,350
How do you like my cozy little store?

921
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:47,550
I made myself pretty comfortable here.

922
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:49,650
Selling old trinkets to travelers.

923
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:51,330
You're planning a trip below?

924
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:54,230
I have several items that may improve your chance of survivability.

925
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:00,000
Okay.

926
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:01,920
Jesus fucking.

927
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,120
How many DLCs are there?

928
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,180
If I can kill all those bugs and rob them of their life savings, why can't I do that for this guy?

929
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,320
It's just all DLCs.

930
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:25,580
All right.

931
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,740
Well, I can't afford any of this.

932
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:34,540
Everyone here wants my money that I worked so hard to earn through murder.

933
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,080
But it's very hard to murder, though.

934
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,280
Guys, I've earned these money through honest means.

935
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,000
You don't understand.

936
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,400
Murder is still very hard to do.

937
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,020
Do I need the egg?

938
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:52,500
I need the egg.

939
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,140
I...

940
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,060
I never lied that I wasn't committing murder.

941
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,500
Alright, let's go.

942
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,700
I guess we could buy the egg.

943
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:09,560
That's the only thing I can afford in this goddamn store.

944
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:16,250
Egg bad?

945
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,810
Wait, what's wrong with this egg?

946
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:18,670
It was $60.

947
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:25,590
What's wrong?

948
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:28,170
Did I get scammed?

949
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:28,950
Oh, my!

950
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:29,770
Did you guys?

951
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,490
I trusted you.

952
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:32,910
I trusted all the...

953
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:38,290
What the fuck does the egg do?

954
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:44,690
Okay, but what does it do?

955
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:49,980
It does nothing.

956
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,140
It's just a rotten egg.

957
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,140
Oh my god.

958
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:53,740
My $60.

959
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,420
That...

960
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,080
My honest means of living.

961
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:06,410
I worked so hard to earn the $60.

962
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,370
Where do I go?

963
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,450
I make a look down.

964
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:17,180
Oh.

965
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,040
I'm so bad at the pogo jump thing.

966
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:23,980
Never mind.

967
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:24,920
I'm a fucking jean.

968
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,320
I'm a fucking natural.

969
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:26,920
JK.

970
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,480
I'm a gaming prodigy.

971
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,660
There we go.

972
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:37,460
This way.

973
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,040
This way.

974
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:46,740
Okay.

975
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,060
We haven't gone right yet.

976
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,560
We haven't gone into the blowing tunnel yet.

977
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,340
There must be something in here.

978
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,140
Oh, there's a bug here.

979
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,860
Hello, ma'am.

980
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:01,580
Hello, fellow bug.

981
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,700
Oh, bury my mother pale and slight.

982
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,960
Burry my father with his eyes shut tight.

983
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,280
Burry my sisters two by two.

984
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,400
And then we're done.

985
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,740
Let's bury me too.

986
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,680
Ha ha, do you know that one?

987
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,680
It's one of my favorites.

988
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,820
You can sing something else if you like.

989
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:20,700
in.

990
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,400
I bet you have a beautiful singing voice.

991
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,260
So, what are you doing down here for?

992
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,120
You came to Giga Wealthy.

993
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,400
Just look around you.

994
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:32,120
These mines are still bursting with riches.

995
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,120
There's plenty for everyone.

996
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,040
Just grab a pick and join in.

997
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:36,440
Ha ha.

998
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:43,340
Over the night where I broke a nail for the priest.

999
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,840
Something about a crown?

1000
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,880
I can't remember the rest of that one.

1001
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:47,480
Ha ha.

1002
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,700
Maybe I'll just hum it.

1003
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,080
Yearns for the mines.

1004
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,740
This is what the mine does when you yearn for too long.

1005
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:02,000
Okay, nice.

1006
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,240
Alright, this way we go.

1007
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,140
Any secrets?

1008
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:18,720
No?

1009
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,960
I guess I'll just stand here then.

1010
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,620
Come on, farm.

1011
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:25,760
Give me a...

1012
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,040
Give me a natural disaster!

1013
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:29,980
Give me a horrific accident right now!

1014
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,520
now.

1015
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,240
I demand my horrific mining accident.

1016
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,400
I guess that's not gonna work.

1017
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:38,660
Not yet.

1018
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,000
God damn.

1019
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:45,180
Can't get my final destination.

1020
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,500
Be careful.

1021
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,880
What do you wish for?

1022
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:57,480
Okay.

1023
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,800
Where do I go then?

1024
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,940
I mean, I guess I could fight.

1025
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,580
That seems like a boss right there.

1026
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,800
Wait, is that silk stuff?

1027
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:06,940
Is that song real?

1028
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:10,080
Is she...

1029
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:10,820
Is she...

1030
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,620
Is she Mary Silksong?

1031
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,000
Right there on my far left?

1032
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,500
Oh hey, it's this guy again.

1033
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,000
Oh shit, he can hit up?

1034
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:27,080
Oh shit, okay.

1035
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:27,820
Now I know.

1036
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,280
Okay, he's too big.

1037
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:29,960
Oh wait.

1038
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,560
Jane Silksong real?

1039
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:36,460
Oh shit.

1040
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:44,020
That's right.

1041
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,460
Get cheesed.

1042
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,680
Can't do nothing.

1043
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:53,720
You're too big.

1044
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,260
You're too wide.

1045
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,040
Stupid.

1046
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,680
Get cheesed.

1047
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,540
Oh, that must be for an upgrade later.

1048
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,060
All right, left we go.

1049
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,260
Oh, he can't do his big jumps because it blocks.

1050
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,160
Nice.

1051
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,000
All right, off we go.

1052
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,060
Oh, I should full heal.

1053
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,800
All right, this should be a boss room, right?

1054
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:34,900
Or Jane Silksong.

1055
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,980
Miss Silksong, is this you?

1056
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,060
Ooh, that's a closed gate.

1057
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,060
Me up here.

1058
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,760
Ma'am, did you hear that news?

1059
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,940
You're getting a sequel.

1060
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,500
After seven years.

1061
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:02,260
Okay.

1062
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:03,120
Oh.

1063
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:04,960
Oh, that is not...

1064
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,680
Guys, I don't think that's Silk Song.

1065
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,520
I...

1066
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,340
Unless she went on a very, very good diet.

1067
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,820
I have a feeling that's not Ma'am's Silk Song.

1068
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:17,520
I...

1069
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,680
A horror ozempic.

1070
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:27,640
I'm like, damn, ma'am.

1071
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:32,700
Oh my god.

1072
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:33,540
I'm bullying.

1073
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,100
I'm a bullying child.

1074
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:40,040
Are you done?

1075
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,960
Are you done now?

1076
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:43,640
Oh,

1077
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:48,690
shit.

1078
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:50,310
Okay.

1079
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,110
I'm gonna...

1080
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:52,350
Oh.

1081
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:54,750
Okay, I thought that was the...

1082
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,210
Alright.

1083
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:59,530
You done with your little temper tantrum?

1084
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:00,310
Sir?

1085
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:04,050
Oh.

1086
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:07,010
I mean, I can heal here.

1087
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:09,150
Oh shit, I can't heal here!

1088
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:09,830
I can't!

1089
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:11,610
Oh shit!

1090
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:14,010
I don't know when it's the...

1091
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:16,710
I don't know when it's the...

1092
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:18,390
The fire strike.

1093
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:19,490
Oh wait, I could just do that.

1094
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:21,870
Never mind, I shouldn't do that.

1095
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:24,410
Okay, it's fine.

1096
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:25,030
I'm safe here.

1097
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,180
Don't worry about the five-strike shit.

1098
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:36,900
Oh, there it is.

1099
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:37,600
There's the five-strike.

1100
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:43,030
This is very predictable.

1101
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:46,170
I can get three hits in.

1102
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,170
Oh, my God.

1103
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:50,010
How did I dodge that?

1104
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:51,730
Nice.

1105
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:53,190
All right, cry.

1106
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:54,650
Cry, little boy.

1107
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:55,650
That's right.

1108
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,350
Right!

1109
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:58,750
Mama hates you!

1110
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:00,650
That's why you're here by yourself.

1111
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:02,390
Doing your mama's...

1112
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:02,810
Oh, shit.

1113
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:03,250
I'm sorry.

1114
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:07,950
Oh, goodbye.

1115
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,980
Give me a sec.

1116
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:17,940
Let me...

1117
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,140
Kill in front of you, too.

1118
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:22,080
Goodbye.

1119
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:24,180
Oh,

1120
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,190
my God.

1121
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:30,110
It was a baby.

1122
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:34,510
What did I get?

1123
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:35,390
The city crest.

1124
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,110
Oh my god, wait.

1125
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:41,130
Is that a baby?

1126
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:47,400
Oh, hello.

1127
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:52,460
Where are you getting?

1128
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,520
Why are you running?

1129
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:54,520
Get over here!

1130
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,660
Alright, what's this?

1131
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,640
Oh, it's the baby's college fun.

1132
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,260
Let's go.

1133
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,120
Did I just kill the child?

1134
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,180
I mean, it won't be the first time.

1135
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,980
That's right, you saw what I did to him going after you next.

1136
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,400
Yoink, my college fun now.

1137
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,130
Not the last.

1138
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:27,770
Yeah.

1139
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,180
They think I'm fighting a boss fight?

1140
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:36,700
Dirt fight?

1141
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:39,100
I am the boss fight.

1142
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,780
Wait, what's up there?

1143
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,060
You're fighting me.

1144
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,260
Hide your kids, hide your wives.

1145
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:55,800
What's there?

1146
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:57,220
Hello?

1147
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,220
Oh, hey, a bench.

1148
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:04,020
Alright, God fucking draw my map that I paid for.

1149
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,540
Oh, who is that creeping out of the darkness?

1150
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,180
Oh, you're looking grim.

1151
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,620
A strange empty face and a wicked looking weapon.

1152
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:18,240
Something important has drawn you down into Halene's corpse.

1153
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:19,900
I won't ask why.

1154
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,480
Perhaps the reason you found me is because you need my help.

1155
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,100
Say no more, friend.

1156
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,580
I want to give you a gift.

1157
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,340
A nasty little spell of my own creation.

1158
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,520
It's just perfect for a little one like you.

1159
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:35,920
Oh, what do I get?

1160
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:37,580
Like, magic?

1161
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:38,820
What is that?

1162
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:48,890
See, when a strange lady tells you to take it...

1163
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,910
Oh, consume the vengeful spirit.

1164
01:29:52,370 --> 01:30:50,770
the spirit spells what they please oh i got a spell nice i told you guys zero survival instincts and strange old lady in this random cavern told me to told me to um touch her glowing her glowing orb and i did it with zero hesitation oh you're looking at last i apologize perhaps i should have warned you about the power of that spell i was watching over you as you slept it seemed that i slipped away myself oh now we're awake i was wondering whether you'll do me a favor not as repayment for my gifts of course simply because we're now friends you see a horde great beast has made its home in the heart of this temple such disrespect I would be quite grateful you're to venture deeper in and slay it for me it's hardly it's a hardy creature but your new power you're more than match for it good luck with this small favor my friend all right wait oh shit Okay,

1165
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:51,850
that shit is strong.

1166
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,390
But then it's like, do I use it for spells?

1167
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:58,050
Or do I use it to heal?

1168
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:02,850
That to, like, manage that.

1169
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:04,770
I have to manage my soul this correctly.

1170
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:12,690
Alright, I'll back up.

1171
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:16,670
Just gotta do a favor for my friend.

1172
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:17,270
Ow.

1173
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:20,370
Okay, let me heal it.

1174
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,590
I think if it's, like, the small...

1175
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:25,710
If I just lose one HP from the small one, I just heal instantly.

1176
01:31:26,370 --> 01:31:28,570
Since I can recharge those very easily.

1177
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:31,010
The souls of the children.

1178
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:37,470
Okay, I can't jump for this.

1179
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:41,810
Alright.

1180
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:43,950
Well, I can touch that odd.

1181
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:44,490
Oh, shit!

1182
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:45,150
Oh, shit!

1183
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:48,370
Parkour, my natural enemy.

1184
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:53,680
Alright.

1185
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,760
Go this way.

1186
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,400
Where the fuck is the...

1187
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,300
The squatter.

1188
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:01,880
I have to kill a squatter for the nice old lady.

1189
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,780
No squatters allowed here.

1190
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:08,620
Is it this guy?

1191
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,140
Fuck you!

1192
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,480
That's right!

1193
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,020
Can't hide now!

1194
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:14,460
I've got spells!

1195
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:17,740
That's right.

1196
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,260
Stop squatting!

1197
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:21,860
Pay your rent!

1198
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:23,880
Wait, was that him?

1199
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,400
I don't even know if that was the squatter.

1200
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:27,160
Not gonna lie.

1201
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,000
Soul catcher.

1202
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:34,740
Oh,

1203
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,320
I got him, man.

1204
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,840
Wait, there was more up top, so I'm going to check up there.

1205
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,820
Okay, so there was another squatter.

1206
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:48,960
Like, I don't even remember.

1207
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:50,300
I wish I'd marked it on the map.

1208
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:53,440
God damn, I should have bought the goddamn DLC tracker.

1209
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:57,800
Okay.

1210
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:01,040
Isn't there another area that I haven't gotten?

1211
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:05,820
That's over there.

1212
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,280
Oh, shit, nice.

1213
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:13,300
I guess he doesn't want to live in the world anymore after I killed his dad.

1214
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:14,580
Understandable.

1215
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,000
Yeah, there's something here that I didn't go to.

1216
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:18,940
What is it?

1217
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,420
Oh, it was just a skull thing.

1218
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,380
Anything else here?

1219
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:29,280
Yeah.

1220
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:33,420
I feel like killing these guys is just not worth it.

1221
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,740
Just a waste of my time.

1222
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:37,360
Oh, I get over.

1223
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:38,260
Oh, wait, nice.

1224
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,880
And I'm gonna steal your college buttons, too.

1225
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,140
Oh, that's a cocoon!

1226
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:49,680
I found this.

1227
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,180
I found Silk Song, guys.

1228
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:56,310
Oh, yeah, I should double check.

1229
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,290
Wait, give me a sec.

1230
01:33:58,650 --> 01:33:59,530
Oh, my gosh.

1231
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:01,490
I need to make sure...

1232
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:05,050
I'm gonna double check that sound.

1233
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:09,250
I wasn't looking when I asked my sound guy if everything was good.

1234
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:11,910
I had to double check.

1235
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:13,750
Alright, tap back in.

1236
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:16,490
Alright, I killed the squatter.

1237
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:17,250
What do I get?

1238
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:20,170
Also, it's Sundan.

1239
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:21,750
You slain the beast.

1240
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:23,090
That poor thing.

1241
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:25,130
It must have been terrified of you.

1242
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:26,750
It used to be quite docile.

1243
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:30,610
But a rancid air in these caverns filled it with some ancient rage.

1244
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:32,110
Can't believe it!

1245
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:34,950
He used to pay rent and didn't?

1246
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:36,250
What a fool.

1247
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:37,570
Here we go.

1248
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:38,990
Thank you for the five gift of ships.

1249
01:34:39,230 --> 01:34:39,370
Thank you.

1250
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:40,030
Thank you.

1251
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:42,510
So, we did what you had to be done.

1252
01:34:42,990 --> 01:34:44,790
You have my gratitude, of course.

1253
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,850
We both know you wouldn't have made it throughout that spell of mine.

1254
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:48,570
Oh, oh, oh.

1255
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:51,090
I'm sure you're eager to move on.

1256
01:34:51,410 --> 01:34:52,470
Farewell and have faith.

1257
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:53,810
I am the evictor.

1258
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:55,510
They hired me to help evict people.

1259
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:58,870
Whatever you're seeking, they will find you.

1260
01:34:59,230 --> 01:34:59,750
Oh, oh, oh.

1261
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,210
That's what they all say.

1262
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,390
They used to be good.

1263
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:06,750
That's what they all say.

1264
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:12,290
and then he got into some bad juju

1265
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:40,680

01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:49,500
Who was the guy that docked my way last time?

1268
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:52,900
I was like this way, right?

1269
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,720
Oh, HP boost.

1270
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:56,220
Okay.

1271
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:58,960
Oh, it was this way, I remember now.

1272
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,920
Alright, gotta kill another squatter.

1273
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:04,480
Was it here?

1274
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,680
Wait, actually, no, it wasn't.

1275
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,040
It wasn't here.

1276
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,720
It was...

1277
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:19,360
Is it right?

1278
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:25,600
Okay, who's the person living over here?

1279
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:28,940
Oh, it's a hot spring.

1280
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:29,520
Okay.

1281
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,460
That's just a bench.

1282
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:35,460
Alright, uh...

1283
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:39,810
Where do I go?

1284
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:43,350
I have new equipment.

1285
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:43,910
Oh, I do.

1286
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:45,510
What do I need to do?

1287
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:46,670
What are my equips?

1288
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,560
What is this?

1289
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:56,500
Used by draw morsels.

1290
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:57,360
Oh, nice.

1291
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,120
I like that.

1292
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,680
I get to have more...

1293
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,640
I get to extort more money from people.

1294
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,100
That's good.

1295
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,160
I knew they were hiding more in the pockets.

1296
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,380
I knew it.

1297
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,000
Can't hide from me.

1298
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:13,040
Gotta pay your debts.

1299
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,520
I'm the loan shark.

1300
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,660
I'm gonna break your fucking kneecaps.

1301
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,280
Oh, oh, souls?

1302
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,500
Oh, shit, okay.

1303
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:25,720
The souls of the children.

1304
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,720
I mean, that's good too, I guess.

1305
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:36,420
Um, we haven't not gone yet.

1306
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,040
Up and left?

1307
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:43,940
Up and left.

1308
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:45,420
Ow!

1309
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:46,860
What the fuck?

1310
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:47,980
Did you spit on me?

1311
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:49,720
That's right.

1312
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:52,780
The kids aren't seeing our mother time soon.

1313
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:58,250
Up, up, up.

1314
01:37:59,710 --> 01:37:59,990
Oh!

1315
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:01,510
Okay, I gotta get 20.

1316
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:04,390
No, I haven't saved anybody's children yet.

1317
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,080
Okay, this way.

1318
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:16,590
Is it here?

1319
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:18,930
Is that... Oh, the squatter's here.

1320
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:20,030
Wait, I remember now.

1321
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:26,350
I think the squatter's up here.

1322
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:36,320
It was like...

1323
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:39,760
yeah right

1324
01:38:43,820 --> 01:39:20,900

1325
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:23,100
Sir, you didn't pay your rent.

1326
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,820
Oh my god, I don't have enough souls.

1327
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:29,200
Oh shit, nice.

1328
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:30,160
Nice.

1329
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:31,760
I can kill your kid.

1330
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,160
And absorb the soul of your child.

1331
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:37,840
There you go.

1332
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,750
Okay, I can't get there yet.

1333
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,960
Alright, this way.

1334
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,160
The green path.

1335
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,520
What's the green path?

1336
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:00,240
Hello?

1337
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,140
Oh, they know.

1338
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,560
I see my crimes have traveled to this world, too.

1339
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,260
They're like, oh, no, she's here!

1340
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,200
Oh, no!

1341
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,400
It's Sean Holland that she made it to Greenpath!

1342
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,820
She got past the defenses!

1343
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:30,540
Get the...

1344
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,560
Get the kids, honey, and run!

1345
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:40,870
That's right, the landlord.

1346
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:41,150
Oops.

1347
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:43,730
The landlord is coming.

1348
01:40:43,870 --> 01:40:44,550
Don't mind that.

1349
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:45,690
Don't mind the father.

1350
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:52,160
Oh, shit.

1351
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:57,080
Are these like poisonous to orange beams?

1352
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:57,860
Okay, they are.

1353
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,880
All right, that answers my question.

1354
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:03,040
It's time to touch grass.

1355
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:09,370
Okay, this way.

1356
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:12,230
Yeah, that felt like a secret.

1357
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:13,530
Oh, shit.

1358
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:14,110
Wait, what?

1359
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:15,310
Oh!

1360
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:17,730
Okay, now I know.

1361
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:22,390
Alright, if you wanted to kill me, you gotta do that a little faster, sir.

1362
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:27,090
Music is nice here.

1363
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,630
Yeah, it's pretty cute.

1364
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:36,870
Alright.

1365
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:38,950
Up, Paco.

1366
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:42,190
I want to make sure there's no secret there.

1367
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:45,890
I'll find a... Oh, I don't have a map for this.

1368
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:49,670
God, I have to buy a map for each area?

1369
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:53,470
Why can't I destroy myself?

1370
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:56,550
I already have a pen.

1371
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:00,070
God, fucking goddamn map DLC.

1372
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:07,300
What's this?

1373
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:08,520
Oh.

1374
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,580
I ran out of paper.

1375
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:14,600
I'll destroy it on the leaves.

1376
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:17,020
I'm literally surrounded by leaves.

1377
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:18,740
I don't need paper.

1378
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,100
Are you a cartographer?

1379
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,040
Oh my god!

1380
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:25,960
Jane Silk's on!

1381
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:27,380
Oh shit, goodbye.

1382
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:29,060
She gotta go to her sequel now.

1383
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,460

1384
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,900

Thank you.

1388
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:44,480
I'm getting fucking... I'm getting extorted now by goddamn Cornelius.

1389
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:54,940
Oh shit, I didn't die Yeah Silk Sook is real Or people need her How the fuck?

1390
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:57,120
Do I have to go back to dirt map?

1391
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:07,490
She's real, quick Take a picture

1392
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:18,120
Okay How the fuck do I get to that?

1393
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:37,800
Oh my god, I'm so lost I'm like Reflexively checking my map because I assume I can assume since I already have a pen that I could draw the map myself but no he apparently has the monopoly on all maps

1394
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:45,420
I guess I don't have a license to draw new maps

1395
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:55,420
I can't jump that cut the vines this okay

1396
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:04,830
I don't even know what looks like vines here I ran out of paper.

1397
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,490
Oi, you got a license for that?

1398
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:13,210
Are you driving maps illegally, sir?

1399
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,280
Let me just rest.

1400
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:25,000
I'm angry.

1401
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,000
Let me sit down and see if a little.

1402
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,840
Illegal maps will not be tolerated in Green Town.

1403
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:41,540
Oh, shit.

1404
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:45,280
Fuck these, yeah, I'm- sorry, I was a little angry there.

1405
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:54,560
Whoops.

1406
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,840
Just remember not to draw maps under the influence.

1407
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:13,400
I don't know where I am.

1408
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:15,500
I don't know where I am anymore.

1409
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:19,840
Oh, shit, I forgot.

1410
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,000
Baby explodes.

1411
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:25,800
Don't draw a drink, yeah.

1412
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,780
Don't cartographer a drink, guys.

1413
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:51,520
whoops that's why Christopher Columbus thought that whoops thought that he could get to like what was India by sailing across the ocean

1414
01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:10,810
oh this okay that's the vine you guys wanted me to cut oh what's the point What's the point of cutting that?

1415
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:16,720
What does that do?

1416
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,490
Yeah.

1417
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:31,090
Menace, thank you for the...

1418
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:31,790
Fuck you.

1419
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:35,750
Let me heal real quick.

1420
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:42,290
Oh my god, there he is.

1421
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:43,250
I hear him.

1422
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:45,130
I hear him.

1423
01:46:45,970 --> 01:46:47,630
I'm ready to buy my map DLC.

1424
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:49,190
Okay.

1425
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:56,810
Is that a cause of contrast or the crossroads?

1426
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:59,950
Trash a human and lively place?

1427
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:04,930
The road switch to turn in the most wonderful ways.

1428
01:47:05,690 --> 01:47:07,970
I thought my best to check the area ahead.

1429
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:12,450
I must remove some of the area and have it as for quite a nuisance.

1430
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:16,310
Oh my god, he upped his prices!

1431
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:20,370
90% of the work.

1432
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:26,050
Paper does not cost $60.

1433
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:29,990
Where is a Walmart in Hollow Knight?

1434
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:33,430
Why does he sound like that?

1435
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:38,230
He is upcharging me $60 for a map.

1436
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:40,290
This is why he sounds like that.

1437
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:42,810
Do you want the map or not?

1438
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:45,570
He has the paper in Monopoly.

1439
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:49,090
God damn it.

1440
01:47:49,210 --> 01:47:51,010
inflation hit hard in Hollow Knight.

1441
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:55,850
Okay, where am I?

1442
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:56,850
Alright.

1443
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:58,410
We're here.

1444
01:47:58,670 --> 01:48:00,810
Okay, so I can go down and right.

1445
01:48:02,690 --> 01:48:03,550
Down and right.

1446
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:05,290
Okay, I have to go down.

1447
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:07,210
I hate him.

1448
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:08,530
I hate him so much.

1449
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:11,670
I hate him in this stupid monopoly.

1450
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:13,510
Eat the rich.

1451
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:14,950
When can I eat him?

1452
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:16,790
This is cheap!

1453
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:27,290
Oh yeah, I can't believe terrorists hit all night.

1454
01:48:27,730 --> 01:48:28,880
I thought I was safe

1455
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:43,290
I can't believe it ever since I crossed the border to Greenland Things got more expensive.

1456
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:50,230
It's so fucked up I remember when paper was $30 guys.

1457
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:50,810
I

1458
01:48:56,260 --> 01:49:06,040

1461
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:31,050
Is he a bad person?

1462
01:49:32,830 --> 01:49:34,310
Time to squib.

1463
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:37,110
You approach squib fearless.

1464
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:39,010
Are you a hunter like me?

1465
01:49:39,450 --> 01:49:43,790
Do you feel the urge inside of stock to kill to understand?

1466
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:46,110
Then take it, my journal.

1467
01:49:46,610 --> 01:49:47,870
It will aid you.

1468
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:51,330
At first, the text may seem difficult to discern.

1469
01:49:51,810 --> 01:49:54,990
But learn, hunter will come to understand its words.

1470
01:49:55,590 --> 01:49:58,250
Venture the depths of this land and slay its beast.

1471
01:49:58,690 --> 01:50:02,050
Prove yourself worthy to bear the mark of the hunter.

1472
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:03,670
Oh, shit, nice.

1473
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:04,830
Free stuff.

1474
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:07,430
See, this is why you go...

1475
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:11,810
This is why you go in with no fear or zero sense of...

1476
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:15,010
Zero sense of survival instincts.

1477
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,990
So you can get free stuff like this.

1478
01:50:18,230 --> 01:50:18,570
Yay!

1479
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:23,570
Look at that.

1480
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:28,670
If you don't venture into the nun, you won't get...

He has to pay off a four-year guitar.

1484
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,820
He has got to pay his loans, guys.

1485
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:15,000
The photography school was so expensive.

1486
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:19,840
Please understand, Lolly.

1487
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:21,060

1493
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:28,260
I guess I'll go here.

1494
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:30,820
Chain silk sign.

1495
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:32,400
Man, please.

1496
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,560
You gotta go to your sequel.

1497
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:37,860
You gotta hurry, it's releasing next week!

1498
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,440
Oh, you're not a child.

1499
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:46,180
Oh, no.

1500
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:47,540
Okay, never mind.

1501
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:48,400
Not that child.

1502
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:50,140
What?

1503
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,080
What are I...

1504
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:54,560
Man, shoot me.

1505
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,060
Okay.

1506
01:51:58,160 --> 01:51:58,700
Nice.

1507
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,280
Not the right child.

1508
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:09,480
Oh.

1509
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:10,660
Oh, it's like Pong.

1510
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:11,820
Yay!

1511
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:19,300
Wait, how do I do this?

1512
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:20,320
Oh, it's here.

1513
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,920
Oh, yo, I'm so good at pawing.

1514
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,840
This way?

1515
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:31,200
What's over here?

1516
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:33,100
Whoa, it's awfully dark in here.

1517
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:35,780
Oh, shit.

1518
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:39,520
All right, that's fine.

1519
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:42,620
I have the souls of the children to absorb.

1520
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:45,600
Nice.

1521
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,700
Come on.

1522
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,640
Come on.

1523
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:50,760
You're depressed.

1524
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:52,240
Come on.

1525
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:53,120
Oh wait.

1526
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:54,400
Come on.

1527
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:54,920
Oh shit!

1528
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:56,120
Okay.

1529
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:57,380
Never mind.

1530
01:52:57,660 --> 01:52:59,540
I'm not playing with my food anymore.

1531
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:04,400
Oh?

1532
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:05,180
Door.

1533
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:08,200
Hello?

1534
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:08,520
Oh!

1535
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:14,220
Alright.

1536
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:16,380
Let's not do that.

1537
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:22,940
Oh my god, there has to be an easier way.

1538
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:23,540
Oh.

1539
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:28,650
Okay.

1540
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,420
Do I go?

1541
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:33,840
Okay, this way.

1542
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:37,860
Oh, this fucking level sucks, guys.

1543
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,660
I can't see anything!

1544
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:42,100
Where am I?

1545
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:46,900
Yeah, there has to be an easier way.

1546
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:50,380
I'm like, this can't be.

1547
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,740
I was like, this can't be right.

1548
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:55,040
Yeah, it's called a flashlight.

1549
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:56,220
God damn it!

1550
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:59,500
It's called a flashlight.

1551
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:03,720
Yeah I'll come back later.

1552
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,000
I'll mark it on my bench.

1553
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:11,090
Oh, down.

1554
01:54:14,110 --> 01:54:14,810
Down I go.

1555
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:16,090
Am I making good progress?

1556
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:17,150
I can't tell.

1557
01:54:17,290 --> 01:54:26,310
I feel like, I definitely feel like, um, I definitely feel like I've been stuck for a while in some areas.

1558
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:27,430
Oh shit.

1559
01:54:28,170 --> 01:54:29,130
And I fall!

1560
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:30,930
Take more damage?

1561
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:34,090
Okay, let me grab some HP.

1562
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:39,030
Okay, that was bullshit.

1563
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:46,470
The fact that falling actually, I got hit and I fell and that took two of my life.

1564
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:51,470
It's not not considered...

1565
01:54:53,830 --> 01:54:54,930
Wait, where's the bench?

1566
01:54:55,010 --> 01:54:55,730
Oh, wait, there's a bench.

1567
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:58,290
There was a bench over here.

1568
01:54:59,330 --> 01:54:59,610
Yeah.

1569
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:01,710
Just go to the bench.

1570
01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:06,430
Wait, no.

1571
01:55:06,930 --> 01:55:07,670
It's above me.

1572
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:09,550
God damn it, it was above me.

1573
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:15,270
If I'm gonna, I'm gonna take your money.

1574
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:19,530
Okay.

1575
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:22,470
Okay, it's this way.

1576
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:24,590
I need the ladder.

1577
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:25,690
DLC.

1578
01:55:29,110 --> 01:55:31,530
Alright, there's the bench.

1579
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:35,050
There we go.

1580
01:55:35,670 --> 01:55:37,210
And I updated my map too.

1581
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:43,830
Okay, I have to go down and do like some freaky ass parkour shit.

1582
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:49,510
In this way.

1583
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:54,390
Oh, I don't care about these guys.

1584
01:55:56,130 --> 01:55:56,650
Alright.

1585
01:55:57,930 --> 01:56:00,550
I do some wiki ass parkour.

1586
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:07,270
Okay, down I'll go.

1587
01:56:08,330 --> 01:56:09,190
Whoa, what's this?

1588
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:11,410
There's like eggs down there.

1589
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:17,750
Wait, jellyfish, can I kill them?

1590
01:56:17,890 --> 01:56:18,450
Oh, I can.

1591
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:20,130
Oh, it's- I'm under water.

1592
01:56:20,230 --> 01:56:20,630
Ow!

1593
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:24,250
Okay, now I know.

1594
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:26,650
Now I know that hurts.

1595
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:30,650
Oh my god, not the fucking water level.

1596
01:56:32,330 --> 01:56:33,110
They're the worst.

1597
01:56:34,510 --> 01:56:36,710
Water levels are always the worst levels.

1598
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:41,970
Oh my god, get me out of here.

1599
01:56:43,090 --> 01:56:44,590
Get me the fuck out of here.

1600
01:56:46,330 --> 01:56:47,290
Jesus Christ.

1601
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:48,210
Oh my god.

1602
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:49,750
Simple geometry.

1603
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:55,920
Eh.

1604
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,800
I shouldn't channel my...

1605
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:00,580
inner demons real quick.

1606
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:05,080
The thing is, I don't know where I'm going.

1607
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:05,980
I'm just going down.

1608
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:12,560
Gambit, thank you for the super chat.

1609
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:12,840
Thank you.

1610
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:14,760
The queen station is this fast.

1611
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:16,280
I'm in another area.

1612
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:17,320
Where am I?

1613
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:19,800
Oh my god, I don't have the DLC for this one either.

1614
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:22,780
I gotta find fucking Cornelius again.

1615
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:25,640
Isn't this something?

1616
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:29,320
I did not expect to discover so huge a stack station after that fog.

1617
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:29,860
descent.

1618
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:33,440
The bugs of Holoness must have been an impressive lot.

1619
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:36,820
Building such great structures so far into the wilds.

1620
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,460
Seems the dangerous creatures about haven't yet made their way in here.

1621
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,100
It's a perfect place for a quick rest.

1622
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:46,560
Oh my god, and I bet you he's gonna charge me like $100 now.

1623
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,780
This stupid who gave him the monopoly?

1624
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,820
Why is he the only cartographer in this bug world?

1625
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:53,340
Let me end!

1626
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:55,460
I'll go to university for cartography!

1627
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:01,520
And then I'll make sure I'll take all the And I'll steal all his customers.

1628
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:04,240
I'll charge myself $1 less than his prices.

1629
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:06,600
Fuck this man.

1630
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:11,500
There's only like five bugs left alive, Doki.

1631
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,380
I'm going to map him out of business.

1632
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:23,220
I'll go back to school just to take his business away.

1633
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:25,140
That's how petty I am.

1634
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,080
Like, where do I go?

1635
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,140
What the fuck?

1636
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:31,880
Who's she?

1637
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:33,300
Hello.

1638
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:34,580
Oh my god.

1639
01:58:35,060 --> 01:58:36,200
She's so tall.

1640
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:38,080
Tall women.

1641
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,040
Oh, come in search of treats, have you?

1642
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:43,580
I chanced upon a unique little fungus growing right above us.

1643
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:46,780
I found it only in this station, and the taste is just fine.

1644
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:49,980
Hello again.

1645
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:52,680
Thank you, thank you.

1646
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:57,000
You guys, you have the little nightmares, pro tag.

1647
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:57,680
Oh, yeah!

1648
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:00,320
I mean, the OmniMage 3 is coming out soon.

1649
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:01,400
Alright, another share.

1650
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:05,420
God, I wish I had a paper to draw this map in.

1651
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:15,840
Smelly, thank you for the super chatting.

1652
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:16,880
Thank you, Doki.

1653
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:17,500
Please help.

1654
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:20,880
I played slots on a cruise and kept winning, and now I think I'm a gambling addict.

1655
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,200
Please tell me to stop gambling.

1656
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:27,940
I've been leaving all my decisions to little coin flip in the past two weeks.

1657
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:30,640
Oh, my God.

1658
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:45,820

Everybody's doing it anyway.

1662
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:26,080
To be fair, I like how I'm like ring, ring, ring.

Oh my god.

Where's the stag?

1666
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:35,860
I like how it's like, it's my money even though I also took other people's money for this.

1667
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:37,920
Greetings, little one.

1668
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:41,400
It's been an age since I've last heard the ring of a station bell.

1669
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:44,320
It echoed down the stagways and called me to him.

1670
02:00:44,340 --> 02:01:09,180
I've grown stiff and tired over these many years And I forgot much The sound of the bell Will always call me back Yeah, I'm the sole customer in Hollow Nest Also doesn't help that I've killed many people So there's been a lack of customers These stagways stretch the dust of Hollow Nest They want to travel them Tell me from the platform I will take you where you need to go Wait,

Where is this area?

1673

Gotta buy my goddamn map DLCs.

1674
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:27,780
Oh, it's the graveyard.

1675
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:30,560
Just keyed it.

1676
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:31,600
Thank you for the super chat.

02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:31,960

Thank you.

Uh, yeah, last save and return to title.

1680
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:40,380
It responds to you that pension keeps everything.

1681
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:42,000
I ain't no quitter.

1682
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:43,220
I ain't no coward.

1683
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:46,700
I'm not gonna save scum.

1684
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:48,340
Alright.

1685
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:52,280
I'm going to buy this pin because I feel like I might need it.

1686
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:55,240
And then...

1687
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:56,640
I don't think I need any of these, though.

1688
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:00,000
Talk to the old man, alright?

1689
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:01,620
A little old man.

1690
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:03,800
My dragoons want me to talk to you.

1691
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:05,600
Oh, what a turn.

1692
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,000
Our sharp thieves come home.

1693
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,580
Just wandered back in.

1694
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:11,100
I hope for grand tales of his time below.

1695
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:12,900
But seems to remember nothing.

1696
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:14,680
Maybe it was all too much for him.

1697
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:17,360
If you're interested in what his wears, watch out.

1698
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:19,160
He drives a hard bargain.

1699
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:20,560
No competition.

1700
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:21,640
That's the problem.

1701
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:28,360
Oh, you're judging this man when the cartographer has been charging me DLC for every place I go?

1702
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:30,780
It's bad for the market.

1703
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:32,120
Not that he's complaining.

1704
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:33,880
Why are you judging him?

1705
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:35,900
We should be judging this couple.

1706
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:38,720
This couple is a menace to society.

1707
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:42,980
Everyone's got a monopoly.

1708
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:46,040
Potomac, chill.

1709
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:47,720
All right.

1710
02:02:49,540 --> 02:02:52,220
piece of soul vessel, you know, these ghastly looking orbs.

1711
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:53,200
Wait, what's this?

1712
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,920
Do you find us a leaving Wagyu behind as Jill?

1713
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:57,080
Oh!

1714
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:58,760
Wait, I like that.

1715
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:04,100
Yeah, not... This charm grants you more time to recover.

1716
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:05,160
Wait, I'm gonna...

1717
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:07,280
Oh, there's the...

1718
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:08,600
Oh, there's the lantern!

1719
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:13,720
I'll get this one.

1720
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:16,460
Oh my god, there's the lantern DLC.

1721
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:23,980
Yeah, why don't you draw the map here?

1722
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,300
I'm trying to!

1723
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:27,660
That's what I've been trying to draw!

1724
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:32,740
But then somehow I ran out of paper, and he has a monopoly on paper, too.

1725
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:36,040
Okay.

1726
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:38,660
I don't think I can equip it yet, though.

1727
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:42,740
Yeah, I can only...

1728
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:48,980
Alright.

1729
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:53,360
Hello, I'd like to travel, please.

1730
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:57,160
Just steal here.

1731
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:58,280
his favorite.

1732
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:04,020
Alright.

1733
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:05,280
What's the purple pin?

1734
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:06,040
I don't even remember.

1735
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:06,920
Oh, it's fine.

1736
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:07,520
We'll get it.

1737
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:09,000
I can't even equip it anyway.

1738
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:12,100
Don't blame the market.

1739
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:12,860
Blame it.

1740
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,920
I like to have souls, though.

1741
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:16,440
Actually, what would be?

1742
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:18,120
I'll go with souls for now.

1743
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,560
I won't get out of here.

1744
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:25,960
Unless I can find, like, the next cartographer for this area.

1745
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:27,680
Where did I come from.

1746
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:28,860
Here?

1747
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:33,040
Yeah, because I can't dash anywhere.

1748
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:41,510
Oh my god.

1749
02:04:41,650 --> 02:04:44,470

1750
02:04:47,490 --> 02:04:47,930

No small bills, apparently.

That's cool.

1778
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:03,870
God, I hate this area.

1779
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:08,690
Oh, my.

1780
02:08:08,710 --> 02:08:10,590

Nice.

1787
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:50,770
Okay.

1788
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:56,730
I'm just trying to figure out where the fuck to go, to be fair.

1789
02:08:58,690 --> 02:08:59,850
Oh my god!

1790
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:01,610
Jesus, it's like a homing missile.

1791
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:06,450
Oh, the explosion does too?

1792
02:09:06,590 --> 02:09:06,950
Oh.

1793
02:09:07,070 --> 02:09:07,610
Okay.

1794
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:17,980
Ah, shit.

1796
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,000
I got really greedy there.

1797
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:28,160
Are you serious?

1798
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:30,720
Are you?

1799
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,140
What?

1800
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:32,060
Okay!

1801
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:33,000
Get me out of here.

1802
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:34,280
I hate this place.

1803
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:39,840
I actually hate this place so much.

1804
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:41,800
I don't want to do this area anymore.

1805
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:43,240
I don't want to do this area anymore.

1806
02:09:43,740 --> 02:09:44,220
Okay.

1807
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:46,680
This place fucking sucks.

1808
02:09:51,380 --> 02:09:53,000
Oh my god.

1809
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:55,020
Get me back into the greens.

1810
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:56,980
Fuck this.

1811
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:02,340
Fuck this.

1812
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:04,120
I want to go back to the green area.

1813
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:09,320
Get me out of here.

1814
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:12,920
I hate this place.

1815
02:10:16,910 --> 02:10:20,310
Okay, my back into my safety area.

1816
02:10:23,990 --> 02:10:26,170
I'm gonna die here, aren't I?

1817
02:10:32,230 --> 02:10:32,790
Alright.

1818
02:10:34,770 --> 02:10:36,070
I'm gonna go this way.

1819
02:10:40,010 --> 02:10:42,250
Why is the bank so far?

1820
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:44,810
Does she not have a franchise?

1821
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:52,290
The fact that the bank is so far, too.

1822
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:56,390
Like, I have to go through the ocean to fucking get to that bank.

1823
02:10:56,910 --> 02:10:58,270
Like, fuck that shit.

1824
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:08,060
Okay.

1825
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:09,720
No, we don't need the bench.

1826
02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:11,240
I'm going forward.

1827
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:14,860
It's okay.

1828
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:15,730
We don't need it.

1829
02:11:17,740 --> 02:11:18,620
Okay, miss last words.

1830
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:19,680
But we don't need it.

1831
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:22,400
I'm stronger than that.

1832
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:25,440
I'm a strong independent John Hollow Knight.

1833
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:30,220
I'm privately owned big.

1834
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:33,800
That's most bigs.

1835
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:34,620
Oh, shit.

1836
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:35,000
Okay.

1837
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:40,240
Sorry, my depth perception failed me.

1838
02:11:45,210 --> 02:11:45,650
Get out of here.

1839
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:47,290
Get your ass out of here, child.

1840
02:11:50,150 --> 02:11:51,550
Okay, maybe I should get him closer.

1841
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:57,840
But...

1842
02:11:58,960 --> 02:11:59,620
That's fine.

1843
02:11:59,700 --> 02:12:00,980
I need your money anyway.

1844
02:12:04,580 --> 02:12:06,560
Affair, I'm thinking about five gifted chips.

1845
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:07,620
Thank you, thank you.

1846
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:10,440
Okay.

1847
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:11,320
Nice.

1848
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:14,720
I need the souls of the children just to save me.

1849
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:17,740
Wait, why?

1850
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:19,300
Why is he there?

1851
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:20,160
Is there a secret?

1852
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:22,080
Oh.

1853
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:25,980
We assume there'll be a secret there.

1854
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:30,500
Alright.

1855
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:33,820
Oh.

1856
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:34,580
Child?

1857
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:37,100
He's like, I don't want to play no more.

1858
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:40,700
Playtime isn't over, you guys.

1861
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:24,220
I'm following J.L.

1862
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:24,920
Silkson.

1863
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:32,080
I'll follow her.

1864
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,200
I don't want to deal with that.

1865
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:36,500
Oh, wait.

1866
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:37,480
There's something down here.

1867
02:13:39,100 --> 02:13:40,420
Oh, I can't make it.

1868
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:41,020
Never mind.

1869
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:44,360
That's why I'm going to delay Silkson for another two years.

1870
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:47,220
Then she went up.

1871
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:54,600
Okay.

1872
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:58,000
Why did she go up here?

1873
02:13:58,020 --> 02:13:58,260

1874
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:01,600

Oh, shit.

1878
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:13,550
I didn't see that guy.

1879
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:18,060
Oh, my god.

1880
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:20,160
Stupid fucking platforms.

You're safe now.

But I'm gonna get you.

1883
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:28,280
See, I told you I was gonna get you.

1884
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:29,380
I didn't lie about that.

1885
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:31,560
I jump from here?

1886
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:32,180
I can't.

1887
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:32,620

1888
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:37,460
Inspect.

Fine.

1891
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:42,440
Give me fast travel.

1892
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:43,720
That's fine.

1893
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:45,220
Oh, wait.

1894
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:46,140
Oh, it was a toll.

1895
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:50,660
I'm literally, this town's only...

1896
02:14:50,660 --> 02:14:53,640
I feel like I'm the town's only customer.

1897
02:15:02,690 --> 02:15:04,390
Like, did no one else open that toll?

1898
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:07,010
Like, how am I the only one that's opened it?

1899
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:08,430
Like...

1900
02:15:11,190 --> 02:15:13,630
Oh, I wanted to see if that was like a platform.

1901
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:17,470
No, it was just a building.

1902
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:20,710
Oh, shit.

1903
02:15:20,930 --> 02:15:22,310
I was trying to do the...

1904
02:15:23,970 --> 02:15:25,930
I was trying to do the little pogo jump.

1905
02:15:26,090 --> 02:15:28,210
I'm so bad at this pogo jump shit.

1906
02:15:29,530 --> 02:15:32,330
It's like, why pogo jump on them when they're right in front of me?

1907
02:15:33,710 --> 02:15:34,310
You know?

1908
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:40,860
Oh my god.

1909
02:15:44,440 --> 02:16:14,600
Yeah, I know that I've seen I've seen people Pogo a lot In this game So I know like it's an actual requirement But I'm just so bad at it I'm not used to Pogo jumping in this game Where's this here I hear a child Where is this child But I can't even get there Okay I don't have a dash.

1910
02:16:19,390 --> 02:16:21,810
You literally just started playing, Doki.

1911
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:23,730
You're not gonna know yet.

1912
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:33,810
The greater of mine once dreamed of leaf and castes caverns so, in every bush and every vine, the mine unreveals itself to us.

1913
02:16:34,350 --> 02:16:35,070
What does that mean?

1914
02:16:35,750 --> 02:16:37,070
Don't understand, guys.

1915
02:16:37,230 --> 02:16:38,150
I'm a gamer!

1916
02:16:38,570 --> 02:16:40,970
I should know how to poke a right away!

1917
02:16:43,470 --> 02:16:48,010
The moment I was boy, I should know how to do a 360 noscope.

1918
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:53,470
Well, is he a bad guy?

1919
02:16:53,570 --> 02:16:54,690
Oh, he is a bad guy.

1920
02:16:55,810 --> 02:16:56,230
Boom!

1921
02:16:57,590 --> 02:16:58,470
Oh, this time.

1922
02:16:58,550 --> 02:17:00,330
Oh, this is when I need a pogo, right?

1923
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:04,750
Oh, shit.

1924
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:05,070
Oops.

1925
02:17:06,270 --> 02:17:07,170
Oh, my God.

1926
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:14,760
Oh, my God.

1927
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:17,080
He has better reflex than me, apparently.

1928
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:18,500
Well, never mind.

1929
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:19,100
He's dead.

1930
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:22,860
I guess not.

1931
02:17:23,300 --> 02:17:24,060
I spoke too soon.

1932
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:24,640
He's dead.

1933
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:35,800
Alright.

1934
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:41,120
I hear a child, but...

1935
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:44,640
I don't know if there's, like, a secret around me.

1936
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:49,480
I hear him.

1937
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:50,380
I hear him crying.

1938
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:51,740
I hear my $20 paycheck.

1939
02:17:53,060 --> 02:17:53,640
I swear...

1940
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:55,340
Okay, I was gonna say, if...

1941
02:17:55,340 --> 02:17:58,100
If I'm, like, in a new area...

1942
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:00,620
And he's like, you don't have a paper for that.

1943
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:05,440
Where am I, though?

1944
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:09,060
Now I wish I had a bench nearby.

1945
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:13,760
Oh.

1946
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:16,400
Oh, I got you.

1947
02:18:19,460 --> 02:18:20,820
I think he mad.

1948
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:22,320
I stole his meal.

1949
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:24,080
That's my soul!

1950
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:27,980
Excuse me, sir.

1951
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:32,020
That's my meal.

1952
02:18:34,380 --> 02:18:34,820
Oh, shit.

1953
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:35,300
Whoops.

1954
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:38,440
Wrong way.

1955
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:40,120
Oh, my God.

1956
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:41,520
Okay, I wasted all that.

1957
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:44,180
I thought... I don't know.

1958
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:48,300
I thought the projectile would be bigger.

1959
02:18:51,460 --> 02:18:52,640
Get down from here!

1960
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:54,740
Oh, this is a horde.

1961
02:18:55,460 --> 02:18:56,140
He's a coward.

1962
02:18:58,820 --> 02:18:59,420
Okay.

1963
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:05,120
Nice.

1964
02:19:05,740 --> 02:19:06,960
Money, money, money.

1965
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:09,200
Must be funny.

1966
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:11,960
And a rich man's word.

1967
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:13,020
Alright, hello.

1968
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:16,100
Just what do you think you're doing, man?

1969
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:18,600
You dare to come between me and my prey?

1970
02:19:19,140 --> 02:19:21,120
Is it a... Get on my hand.

1971
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:24,060
Is it having yours to screw you about, man?

1972
02:19:24,480 --> 02:19:26,120
Getting away and causing bother?

1973
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:28,520
Know this, girl.

1974
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:30,180
I am Zot, the mighty.

1975
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:32,400
A knight of great renown.

1976
02:19:33,060 --> 02:20:04,300

Don't be rude as Zoka mighty.

1978
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:08,620
He is mighty.

1979
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:10,180
Did you not see his name?

1980
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:12,260
I will kill this child.

1981
02:20:18,140 --> 02:20:18,520
Come on!

1982
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:19,160
Come out!

1983
02:20:19,260 --> 02:20:20,380
You started this!

1984
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:22,280
That's lucky, right?

1985
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:27,500
Respect your elders, Toki.

1986
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:31,340
He has to earn my respect.

1987
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:34,920
Oh, fuck this.

1988
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:36,300
This guy is actually so annoying.

1989
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:43,500
Green children, watch from the dreams onto this lands.

1990
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:47,160
Here we shall now shall wait patient for the call to return.

1991
02:20:47,820 --> 02:20:49,340
The secret is just lore?

1992
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:56,270
Alright, this way.

1993
02:20:58,310 --> 02:20:59,290
Oh shit, it's him.

1994
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:01,290
I keep forgetting that...

1995
02:21:01,290 --> 02:21:02,790
Oh my god, I keep forgetting about this guy.

1996
02:21:05,810 --> 02:21:06,850
Oh my god!

1997
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:07,370
Okay, wait.

1998
02:21:07,910 --> 02:21:09,530
Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1999
02:21:10,750 --> 02:21:11,190
Wait a minute.

2000
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:14,290
Oh my god, and he can do projectiles too?

2001
02:21:14,850 --> 02:21:15,950
Wait, this guy is harder.

2002
02:21:18,570 --> 02:21:20,550
Wait, he's a lot harder than...

2003
02:21:20,550 --> 02:21:22,610
He is a lot harder than the other guy.

2004
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:25,990
What the fuck?

2005
02:21:28,370 --> 02:21:30,250
He does double hit now?

2006
02:21:32,990 --> 02:21:33,430
Okay.

2007
02:21:34,650 --> 02:21:36,830
Alright, at least I can save my...

2008
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:37,330
Nice.

2009
02:21:40,590 --> 02:21:43,090
This guy was a lot harder than the first one.

2010
02:21:44,210 --> 02:21:46,090
Because he like double hit and everything.

2011
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:50,600
Yeah.

2012
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:54,220
This way.

2013
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:01,340
Oh, less base?

2014
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:01,960
Oh, maybe.

2015
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:03,920
It felt a lot harder.

2016
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:08,340
Come no closer, ghost.

2017
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:12,960
I've seen you creeping through the undergrowth, stalking me.

2018
02:22:13,620 --> 02:22:16,680
This old kingdom, a terrible thing awakens.

2019
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:18,560
I can smell it in the air.

2020
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:20,180
I know what you are.

2021
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:22,020
I know what you try to do.

2022
02:22:22,580 --> 02:22:23,880
I can't allow it.

2023
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:24,880
What did I do?

2024
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:26,280
Wait, this is a boss fight?

2025
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:27,500
Oh, shit!

2026
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:28,280
Oh, shit!

2027
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,680
Okay, this might be where I die.

2028
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:33,420
I was not prepared for a boss fight.

2029
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:34,740
Oh!

2030
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:37,220
Oh!

2031
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:39,620
Oh, shit.

2032
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:39,960
Hello.

2033
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:42,820
I ain't grabbing.

2034
02:22:43,880 --> 02:22:44,360
Adidas?

2035
02:22:50,260 --> 02:22:52,740
Okay, I can do a heal here.

2036
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:53,680
No, I can't!

2037
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,580
That's I could.

2038
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:01,880
I should say Adidas, isn't it?

2039
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:02,480
What the fuck?

2040
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:04,560
Oh, unlucky.

2041
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:07,920
I need an extra heal.

2042
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:09,660
Oh, wait.

2043
02:23:12,380 --> 02:23:13,820
Oh, that was like a free hit.

2044
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:28,880

2046
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:51,260
Adidas.

2047
02:23:54,220 --> 02:23:55,000
There you go.

2048
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:56,280
Nice.

2049
02:23:56,480 --> 02:23:57,100
Wait, that's easy.

2050
02:23:57,340 --> 02:23:58,560
They made a sequel for you?

2051
02:24:06,020 --> 02:24:08,400
The Moth... Oh my god, I can finally dash.

2052
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:13,260
Use the cloak to dash quickly along the ground.

2053
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:15,440
No wonder it took seven years.

2054
02:24:18,980 --> 02:24:19,540
That's it.

2055
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:20,160
We did it.

2056
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:21,520
We killed Silksai.

2057
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:24,740
Use the cloak to dash quickly along the ground or through the air.

2058
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:25,480
Oh, nice.

2059
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:26,360
Fucking finally.

2060
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:28,400
That's actually what we needed.

2061
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:31,000
What?

2062
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:35,420
Would it seek to break the seals?

2063
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:37,620
They cannot be a done.

2064
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:39,300
They must be undone.

2065
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:41,660
Let us keep sleep, little shadow.

2066
02:24:42,140 --> 02:24:43,300
Turn to your darkness.

2067
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:44,920
Allow us our peace.

2068
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:45,460
We did it.

2069
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,100
We cancelled Sip-Song, guys.

2070
02:24:50,300 --> 02:24:53,440
Because she's needed seven years to train for Sip-Song.

2071
02:24:56,500 --> 02:24:56,900
Okay.

2072
02:25:01,230 --> 02:25:02,550
We're at the break the seal?

2073
02:25:02,910 --> 02:25:04,190
Whatever that is.

2074
02:25:05,270 --> 02:25:06,310
Oh, thank God.

2075
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:08,950
Whoops.

2076
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:10,230
Wait, why can't I grab that?

2077
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:13,110
Excuse me, sir.

2078
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:13,570
Oh, wait.

2079
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:14,630
Oh, I have to...

2080
02:25:15,630 --> 02:25:17,010
I have to dash from...

2081
02:25:17,030 --> 02:25:18,110
there, I see.

2082
02:25:18,570 --> 02:25:19,150
Oh, shit!

2083
02:25:20,270 --> 02:25:20,750
Whoops.

2084
02:25:21,650 --> 02:25:22,730
That was an oopsie.

2085
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:30,040
But there was something over there.

2086
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:32,480
I want to check over here.

2087
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,800
We'll make sure I'm not missing anything.

2088
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:46,180
Oh, this is where I came from, right?

2089
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:50,340
Yeah, this is where I came from.

2090
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:51,320
Whoops.

2091
02:25:51,900 --> 02:25:52,140
Whoops.

2092
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:54,320
I might have panicked a little.

2093
02:26:02,300 --> 02:26:05,740
You might be able to beat this before Silk Song at this rank.

2094
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:07,460
Alright, well, thank you for the super chat.

2095
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:07,800
Thank you.

2096
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:10,800
Wait, was that boss fight supposed to be hard?

2097
02:26:15,010 --> 02:26:18,150
I mean, her moves are pretty predictable.

2098
02:26:18,850 --> 02:26:21,590
I might be bad at platformers, but...

2099
02:26:21,590 --> 02:26:24,770
I have reflexes at least, I guess.

2100
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:27,590
Oh my god.

2101
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:28,670
my first bench.

2102
02:26:31,270 --> 02:26:32,370
Oh, I still can't afford it.

2103
02:26:32,510 --> 02:26:33,350
When can I upgrade?

2104
02:26:33,810 --> 02:26:34,990
Oh, she's a noob filter?

2105
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:35,730
Ha ha!

2106
02:26:36,270 --> 02:26:37,610
I ain't no noob!

2107
02:26:38,550 --> 02:26:39,190
Go on.

2108
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:40,270
Oh, hello there.

2109
02:26:40,410 --> 02:26:42,330
Seems we both tread far from the path.

2110
02:26:42,850 --> 02:26:46,890
I can hardly believe those dusty old highways led to such a lush and lively place.

2111
02:26:48,450 --> 02:26:51,570
This building suggests some form of worship.

2112
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:52,850
Not a noob!

2113
02:26:52,950 --> 02:26:53,450
Let's go!

2114
02:26:53,970 --> 02:26:54,790
That's right.

2115
02:26:55,050 --> 02:26:56,290
You're watching a gamer!

2116
02:26:57,610 --> 02:27:00,250
Though, its idol has clearly been long forgotten.

2117
02:27:00,770 --> 02:27:03,070
Doubles equally well for a moment's respite.

2118
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,760
Not last.

2119
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:12,200
Nice.

2120
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:15,880
Stupid.

2121
02:27:18,180 --> 02:27:19,480
That's right.

2122
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:20,740
Maybe if you did...

2123
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:21,340
Bullshit!

2124
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:26,040
Give me a second.

2125
02:27:26,760 --> 02:27:27,840
Okay, I should leave.

2126
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:29,520
Okay.

2127
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:33,020
I gotta jump for your money.

2128
02:27:41,630 --> 02:27:44,070
Alright, let's head home, I guess.

2129
02:27:44,410 --> 02:27:44,950
Oh, shit.

2130
02:27:45,210 --> 02:27:46,130
God damn it.

2131
02:27:46,850 --> 02:27:51,870
I feel like I'd lose more HP from just the platforms and not the enemies.

2132
02:27:53,950 --> 02:27:57,290
The enemies are not the thing I have to worry about.

2133
02:27:57,650 --> 02:27:59,390
Han, thank you for the five gifted ships.

2134
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:00,430
Thank you, thank you.

2135
02:28:00,490 --> 02:28:01,650
Alright, where do I go now?

2136
02:28:02,150 --> 02:28:05,470
Now that I got the dash, I guess I go this way.

2137
02:28:09,310 --> 02:28:09,830
Okay.

2138
02:28:12,930 --> 02:28:15,530
Is there anything over here first before I go?

2139
02:28:17,550 --> 02:28:18,450
I hear...

2140
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:19,590
I don't know if they're the kids?

2141
02:28:19,830 --> 02:28:23,550
If they're my $20 paychecks or...

2142
02:28:23,550 --> 02:28:24,150
Or what?

2143
02:28:27,570 --> 02:28:28,630
Where am I?

2144
02:28:32,990 --> 02:28:34,110
Oh, there's a bench.

2145
02:28:34,270 --> 02:28:34,510
Nice.

2146
02:28:38,190 --> 02:28:39,750
Okay, gotta draw my little map.

2147
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:47,570
I can't...

2148
02:28:47,570 --> 02:28:49,930
Why can't someone else pay for these tollers?

2149
02:28:50,110 --> 02:28:52,430
Why does it have to be me?

2150
02:28:58,070 --> 02:28:59,730
God damn it.

2151
02:29:00,110 --> 02:29:01,170
Get over here.

2152
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:04,970
There is no... Because you keep killing everyone else, Doki!

2153
02:29:07,950 --> 02:29:10,330
No one else is traveling.

2154
02:29:11,350 --> 02:29:13,030
Why is it always me?

2155
02:29:14,270 --> 02:29:17,130
I'm literally this world's only customer.

2156
02:29:17,290 --> 02:29:19,330
I'm keeping everybody afloat right now.

2157
02:29:28,320 --> 02:29:29,880
I'm their only customer.

2158
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:31,800
Where do I go here?

2159
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:33,100
Was that the boss?

2160
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:35,680
Let's see.

2161
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:39,280
Here is an area to my far, right?

2162
02:29:42,660 --> 02:29:44,660
I'll go to the right side.

2163
02:29:46,540 --> 02:29:51,880
This entire economy, the capital's GDP is powered by one single bug.

2164
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:58,320
That's so sad.

2165
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:09,040
This way.

2166
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:12,200
Have I killed you before?

2167
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:13,260
Or are you new?

2168
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:24,120
Alright.

2169
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:25,920
I don't know they respond.

2170
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:27,100
So I don't know.

2171
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:29,700
What the fuck?

2172
02:30:31,300 --> 02:30:32,460
Oh, he respawned?

2173
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:33,840
Okay, but you do have a lot of money.

2174
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:35,240
So I'm going to rob you.

2175
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:39,220
Nikita, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2176
02:30:39,700 --> 02:30:41,200
Hello, I'm the resident green path.

2177
02:30:41,380 --> 02:30:48,760
I was on my way to the tofu, but some of this beady-eyed bug in a hoodie just ran up and stabbed me and stole my wallet.

2178
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:52,440
Now I'm stuck and unable to go off.

2179
02:30:52,780 --> 02:30:54,540
Who could do such a thing?

2180
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:56,440
Did you report to the police, sir?

2181
02:30:58,500 --> 02:30:59,720
Oh, my God.

2182
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:02,460
Who could do such a heinous crime?

2183
02:31:03,380 --> 02:31:05,620
Someone's got a, we gotta have a neighborhood.

2184
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:35,460
watch guys don't worry I volunteer don't worry citizens I shall volunteer myself to be the neighborhood watch I do require a salary though what oh my god I don't have a map for this area too How many areas is he gonna charge me?

2185
02:31:43,650 --> 02:31:45,910
Like, where does this end?

2186
02:31:46,570 --> 02:31:47,090
Oh,

2187
02:31:51,330 --> 02:31:51,410
nice.

2188
02:31:51,570 --> 02:31:52,190
My $1.

2189
02:31:52,750 --> 02:31:53,450
That's... Oh, whoa.

2190
02:31:53,550 --> 02:31:54,190
It's a cave.

2191
02:31:54,370 --> 02:31:54,810
Oh, cool.

2192
02:31:55,530 --> 02:31:57,010
Oh, not cool anymore.

2193
02:31:57,150 --> 02:31:57,350
Wait.

2194
02:31:57,550 --> 02:31:58,630
This is not cool.

2195
02:31:59,390 --> 02:32:00,270
Wait, not cool.

2196
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:05,460
Oh, wait.

2197
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:08,260
If I stay here, I can just... Wait a minute.

2198
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,070
I didn't think things through.

2199
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:16,320
Like, I could...

2200
02:32:21,390 --> 02:32:22,150
Oh, shit.

2201
02:32:24,290 --> 02:32:25,890
This guy is so annoying, though.

2202
02:32:32,280 --> 02:32:32,780
There we go.

2203
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:36,020
What the fuck?

2204
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:38,940
Oh!

2205
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,340
No!

2206
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:42,440
Where am I?

2207
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:43,100
Oh!

2208
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:47,960
The Rick Ricochet!

2209
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:51,160
Oh my god, I gotta look at the map again.

2210
02:32:53,320 --> 02:32:55,080
I lost to our ball.

2211
02:32:58,840 --> 02:33:00,980
The fucking ricochet got me.

2212
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:04,150
Gotta remember where I died too.

2213
02:33:10,380 --> 02:33:12,100
That's fine, I don't need this.

2214
02:33:15,220 --> 02:33:17,460
Okay, I think I remember how to get there.

2215
02:33:18,580 --> 02:33:19,380
It's like here.

2216
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:23,360
And then... here?

2217
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:38,300
okay what do i it's like here here all right oh my god i'm getting impatient now

2218
02:33:42,550 --> 02:33:56,850
but when it first tried but died to a roly boy you don't understand you don't understand that roly boy he had a gun.

2219
02:33:57,730 --> 02:33:59,370
Guys, he had...

2220
02:33:59,970 --> 02:34:03,170
I swear to God, he had a gun.

2221
02:34:08,480 --> 02:34:13,040
Oh my god, I keep fucking that jump up, because I'm getting impatient.

2222
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:15,200
Okay.

2223
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:17,380
We do this again.

2224
02:34:18,300 --> 02:34:19,100
Oh, they're dead.

2225
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:20,040
Oh!

2226
02:34:20,820 --> 02:34:21,940
I did it.

2227
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:22,740
Never mind.

2228
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:28,900
Oh, that sucks.

2229
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,640
I didn't get to Keep the money, though, for a bit.

2230
02:34:36,780 --> 02:34:37,680
Oh, there's stuff to the right?

2231
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:38,400
Okay, I'll check.

2232
02:34:42,620 --> 02:34:43,320
Oh, my God.

2233
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:44,480
They're all roly boys.

2234
02:34:46,620 --> 02:34:47,640
The boulder shell.

2235
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:48,920
What's that?

2236
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:52,700
The hard shell.

2237
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:53,880
Well, the shell is not...

2238
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:54,200
Oh!

2239
02:34:57,340 --> 02:35:00,940
Oh, so when I heal myself, I can just use it.

2240
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:04,360
I'm going to try to defeat the reins before the endless street...

2241
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:04,960
the stream.

2242
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:05,660
Wish me luck.

2243
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:05,920
Sack.

2244
02:35:06,020 --> 02:35:06,820
Thank you for the super chat.

2245
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:07,160
Thank you.

2246
02:35:07,320 --> 02:35:07,800
Thank you.

2247
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:11,620
I have no idea what that is, but I bet you can do it.

2248
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:13,600
You got this, bro.

2249
02:35:20,660 --> 02:35:22,600
Okay, am I back in the green lands?

2250
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:23,840
Oh, I'm back here.

2251
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:30,800
Am I supposed to go anywhere here?

2252
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:32,760
Did I finish the green path yet?

2253
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:33,720
I can't tell.

2254
02:35:42,010 --> 02:35:42,470
Alright.

2255
02:35:42,910 --> 02:35:44,150
We go this way then.

2256
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:52,340
Now I got everything here.

2257
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:54,940
Did I do it?

2258
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:55,840
Did I beat the game?

2259
02:35:59,320 --> 02:36:00,660
Sam, thank you for the super chat.

2260
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:01,020
Thank you.

2261
02:36:01,400 --> 02:36:01,780
Thank you.

2262
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:04,380
Okay, where else have I not gone?

2263
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:06,140
Okay.

2264
02:36:06,620 --> 02:36:07,940
I've not gone down.

2265
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:09,080
Okay, we'll do down.

2266
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:12,400
Also, this map is fucking garbage.

2267
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:14,160
Because there's like...

2268
02:36:14,840 --> 02:36:16,720
Because sometimes it says you have to go...

2269
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:37,860
there's an exit that way but then like it's not the same as the area i'm in to access the exit oh get me out of here oh you know you don't you know you no i want your money you don't it i want your money there you go i'm having a bad day sir

2271
02:36:48,540 --> 02:36:50,680
Wait, unless I have to look here.

2272
02:36:51,060 --> 02:36:54,120
Oh, I oh, I can't.

2273
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:55,360
Oh, wait, no, I can't.

2274
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:02,420
Alright.

2275
02:37:04,540 --> 02:37:05,380
Let's see.

2276
02:37:06,300 --> 02:37:08,640
This is an oh, shit.

2277
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:11,300
Okay, there is somewhere I haven't gone here.

2278
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:14,940
Yeah, I haven't gone here yet.

2279
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,260
Whatever this place is.

2280
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:20,160
Oh, it's...

2281
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:21,220
Oh, no, it's just this guy.

2282
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:29,060
Every time I remotely hear like, I think it's my paycheck, but it's not.

2283
02:37:34,500 --> 02:37:34,920
Okay.

2284
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:37,020
It's these little guys.

2285
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:39,800
They sound just like the little worms.

2286
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:42,520
Okay, this way.

2287
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:50,320
Alright.

2288
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:54,300
Get out of here.

2289
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:56,040
You don't even drop that much money.

2290
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:56,980
You're not worth my time.

2291
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,820

2298
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:53,380
It was self-defense, guys.

2299
02:39:53,540 --> 02:39:54,900
They were gonna rob me.

2300
02:39:55,740 --> 02:39:57,400
I was just defending myself.

2301
02:39:58,900 --> 02:40:00,840
I'm literally just taking it all because I just don't care.

2302
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:14,420
Alright, this way.

2303
02:40:22,690 --> 02:40:23,190
Downstairs.

Thank you.

2309
02:40:29,570 --> 02:40:30,370
Don't worry.

2310
02:40:31,050 --> 02:40:36,870
I will catch I will catch whoever has been vandalizing our safe and wonderful neighborhood.

2311
02:40:38,030 --> 02:40:39,770
If it's the last thing I do.

2312
02:40:43,090 --> 02:40:43,430
Oh shit.

2313
02:40:43,690 --> 02:40:43,690
Whoops.

2314
02:40:43,870 --> 02:40:47,070
That was a that was the wrong button.

2315
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:48,250
What's this?

2316
02:40:50,190 --> 02:40:51,470
Oh, I have to go here.

2317
02:41:00,210 --> 02:41:02,090
Won't somebody think of that chill?

2318
02:41:02,190 --> 02:41:04,550
Oh my god, it's these types.

2319
02:41:04,970 --> 02:41:05,790
Oh my!

2320
02:41:05,990 --> 02:41:06,730
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2321
02:41:12,060 --> 02:41:13,800
It's not that important.

2322
02:41:20,080 --> 02:41:20,660
It's...

2323
02:41:21,580 --> 02:41:22,440
Okay, wait.

2324
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:26,880
Okay, if I can get one more...

2325
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:28,620
You got this, too.

2326
02:41:33,500 --> 02:41:35,240
Okay, we'll try this again.

2327
02:41:43,570 --> 02:41:45,450
We'll try this again.

2328
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:51,000
Let's try it.

2329
02:41:51,020 --> 02:41:53,180
Let me get past the first part, though.

2330
02:42:03,450 --> 02:42:04,170
Okay.

2331
02:42:07,650 --> 02:42:08,370
Okay.

2332
02:42:15,060 --> 02:42:16,180
Okay, there we go.

2333
02:42:16,300 --> 02:42:17,000
We did it.

2334
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:18,300
We did it.

2335
02:42:19,660 --> 02:42:20,880
Scorns of agony.

2336
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:21,420
Oh my god.

2337
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:23,400
This shit better be fucking important.

2338
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:32,560
All right, where do I go now?

2339
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:34,460
I keep actually pressing the wrong button.

2340
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:37,300
I guess I'll go down?

2341
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:40,200
Seems to be something downstairs.

2342
02:42:50,750 --> 02:42:52,090
All right, to the far left.

2343
02:42:58,360 --> 02:42:58,580
Oh.

2344
02:43:01,060 --> 02:43:01,800
Where am I?

2345
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,540
Oh, I had to go up.

2346
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:04,600
I was like, what the fuck?

2347
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:05,260
Where did I go?

2348
02:43:06,980 --> 02:43:07,940
Okay, this way.

2349
02:43:08,700 --> 02:43:10,780
Alright, let me look at the map while we're going.

2350
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:13,300
Let me get my GPS going first.

2351
02:43:15,720 --> 02:43:17,460
Okay, I haven't gone this way yet.

2352
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:20,220
Oh, man.

2353
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:20,660
Okay.

2354
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:23,340
It's like all Pogo's.

2355
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:25,540
Wait, where do I go from here?

2356
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:27,840
Wait, what?

2357
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:31,100
There's like nothing there.

2358
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:33,660
How the fuck am I supposed to head there?

2359
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:35,860
Yeah.

2360
02:43:37,100 --> 02:43:41,480
Oh, I can't do this yet.

2361
02:43:41,560 --> 02:43:42,180
I was going to sit.

2362
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:43,720
What the fuck?

2363
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:46,000
Alright, I finished this area.

2364
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:47,400
Where do I go now?

2365
02:43:48,020 --> 02:43:48,760
Park Canyon?

2366
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:55,640
I'm going to try and find a bench.

2367
02:43:56,400 --> 02:43:57,280
Oh, it's above me.

2368
02:43:58,340 --> 02:43:59,460
I'm going to get to the bench.

2369
02:44:01,720 --> 02:44:03,260
But let me grab this money first.

2370
02:44:06,640 --> 02:44:08,360
Oh my god, I need a toll here.

2371
02:44:08,680 --> 02:44:09,320
Oh my god.

2372
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:11,480
Thank you for the 50 gift of chips.

2373
02:44:11,720 --> 02:44:13,020
Thank you, thank you.

2374
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:15,160
Thank you so much for the support.

2375
02:44:15,740 --> 02:44:16,000
Don't worry.

2376
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:18,920
I'll make sure I'll definitely keep the neighborhood safe now.

2377
02:44:19,340 --> 02:44:21,140
We will capture this menace.

2378
02:44:22,940 --> 02:44:25,960
So our children won't have to worry no more.

2379
02:44:27,060 --> 02:44:28,260
But thank you again.

2380
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:29,560
I really appreciate it.

2381
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,940
But 50 gift of chips.

2382
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:38,500
I'll work night and day.

2383
02:44:40,140 --> 02:44:43,700
Crime rate did spike up since I started working.

2384
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:48,340
But it's because whoever it is is getting scared.

2385
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:52,140
So they're working extra hard and robbing everyone.

2386
02:44:56,810 --> 02:44:58,550
Okay, we got this area.

2387
02:44:59,570 --> 02:45:00,570
Now where do we go?

2388
02:45:01,510 --> 02:45:03,030
We go to fog canyon?

2389
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:09,240
Where the fuck do I go?

2390
02:45:11,700 --> 02:45:12,440
Huh.

2391
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:25,520
I go to Forgotten Crossroads?

2392
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:31,240
Ow.

2393
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:36,000
Yeah, they're getting desperate.

2394
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:37,240
They'll slip up soon, guys.

2395
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:37,900
Don't worry.

2396
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:40,200
I'll protect you all.

2397
02:45:48,110 --> 02:45:49,110
Kind of fucking...

2398
02:45:49,110 --> 02:45:50,430
At least, I'm trying to read the map.

2399
02:45:52,770 --> 02:45:53,650
Oh, shit!

2400
02:45:54,730 --> 02:45:56,810
I was trying to read.

2401
02:45:56,830 --> 02:45:57,510
my map.

2402
02:45:57,650 --> 02:45:58,930
It's distracting me.

2403
02:46:02,270 --> 02:46:02,870
Here we go.

2404
02:46:03,230 --> 02:46:04,150
I guess we could go right.

2405
02:46:10,830 --> 02:46:11,550
Yeah, I'll go right.

2406
02:46:11,930 --> 02:46:12,770
What's over here?

2407
02:46:13,230 --> 02:46:13,550
Money!

2408
02:46:24,730 --> 02:46:25,210
Many.

2409
02:46:25,470 --> 02:46:26,650
Thank you for the super chat.

2410
02:46:26,950 --> 02:46:27,170
Thank you.

2411
02:46:27,250 --> 02:46:27,790
Thank you.

2412
02:46:28,430 --> 02:46:32,730
I know Doki is the neighborhood meant, but I just can't prove it.

2413
02:46:32,950 --> 02:46:34,010
How could it be me?

2414
02:46:34,230 --> 02:46:43,410
Yes, the crime somehow happens after I inspect the neighborhood, but it because they knew I was leaving, so they robbed the place after I left.

2415
02:46:45,930 --> 02:46:47,230
It could never, it couldn't be me.

2416
02:46:47,970 --> 02:46:50,830
I'm working so hard to protect all of us.

2417
02:46:51,470 --> 02:46:53,050
How could you say such a thing?

2418
02:46:57,140 --> 02:46:57,800
There is no.

2419
02:46:58,180 --> 02:47:00,420
Cossation does not equal correlation.

2420
02:47:02,980 --> 02:47:05,220
Or correlation does not equal causation.

2421
02:47:07,380 --> 02:47:09,420
Lying, thank you for the 10 gifted.

2422
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:10,180
Thank you, thank you.

2423
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:10,600
Thank you.

2424
02:47:12,300 --> 02:47:13,420
Sit down.

2425
02:47:23,610 --> 02:47:25,050
I forgot where to go.

2426
02:47:26,090 --> 02:47:26,950
I'm so lost.

2427
02:47:35,250 --> 02:47:35,950
Me here.

2428
02:47:36,690 --> 02:47:36,930
Ow!

2429
02:47:40,850 --> 02:47:42,130
Oh, I didn't go here.

2430
02:47:42,390 --> 02:47:43,170
Yeah, now I have dash.

2431
02:47:45,310 --> 02:47:46,310
Okay, this is new.

2432
02:47:48,110 --> 02:47:48,610
Hello.

2433
02:47:48,910 --> 02:47:50,210
Are you a bad person?

2434
02:47:51,830 --> 02:47:52,990
He seems nice.

2435
02:47:59,330 --> 02:48:01,590
Yeah, he seems like a nice guy, right?

2436
02:48:03,410 --> 02:48:04,530
It's like you go up to a bear.

2437
02:48:04,870 --> 02:48:06,590
Hello, are you friendly, Mr. Bear?

2438
02:48:09,730 --> 02:48:12,690
Are you a friendly bear or a bad bear?

2439
02:48:16,810 --> 02:48:18,210
Okay, I need to figure out a deal.

2440
02:48:18,330 --> 02:48:20,390
Okay, I just dash, I think, if he does that.

2441
02:48:21,790 --> 02:48:23,710
Okay, I'm getting hit by everything right now.

2442
02:48:26,830 --> 02:48:27,130
Okay.

2443
02:48:31,930 --> 02:48:34,750
It's like, is that my new pet?

2444
02:48:36,910 --> 02:48:40,370
Can you figure out how to fucking fight this guy?

2445
02:48:41,910 --> 02:48:43,150
He's very annoying.

2446
02:48:45,050 --> 02:48:46,390
I'll just do Pogo for this.

2447
02:48:49,570 --> 02:48:51,050
Yeah, Pogo for that.

2448
02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:54,870
Yeah, I'll dash for this.

2449
02:48:57,570 --> 02:48:58,170
Nice!

2450
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:05,860
Oh my god, they're all kids.

2451
02:49:06,300 --> 02:49:07,820
Oh my god, it's three children in one.

2452
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:11,380
It's like the Vincent adult man.

2453
02:49:11,720 --> 02:49:13,980
It's like three- It's three kids in a trench coat!

2454
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:17,860
World class, thank you for these!

2455
02:49:18,020 --> 02:49:20,240
Five gift of chips, thank you, thank you.

2456
02:49:24,790 --> 02:49:26,890
It's three kids in a trench coat.

2457
02:49:28,550 --> 02:49:29,510
It is!

2458
02:49:33,070 --> 02:49:34,930
Three kids in a moss coat.

2459
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:42,220
Alright.

2460
02:49:43,220 --> 02:49:46,100
Must be something here because they're making me parkour.

2461
02:49:50,190 --> 02:49:50,850
Oh.

2462
02:49:51,330 --> 02:49:52,610
Okay, I'll kill this guy.

2463
02:49:54,650 --> 02:49:55,290
Oh yeah.

2464
02:49:56,110 --> 02:49:57,870
It's a fucking coward.

2465
02:50:00,830 --> 02:50:01,110
Nice.

2466
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:09,540
Alright.

2467
02:50:09,800 --> 02:50:10,380
Abaco.

2468
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:17,820
I don't know, these are the toxic plants I feel like isn't really worth dealing with.

02:50:52,930 --> 02:50:54,530
It's below me.

2471
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:55,490
Oh, okay.

2472
02:50:56,570 --> 02:50:58,150
I was like, who's making these sounds?

2473
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,280
Right in this way.

2474
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:07,260
Oh.

2475
02:51:08,300 --> 02:51:11,260
Oh, I thought it would be another little cave, like last time.

2476
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:16,020
Oh, $20 time.

2477
02:51:17,900 --> 02:51:18,320
No!

2478
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:20,700
Okay, I got impatient with that.

2479
02:51:22,660 --> 02:51:24,480
I thought I was being real clever.

2480
02:51:26,040 --> 02:51:27,020
super impatient.

2481
02:51:36,950 --> 02:51:37,830
I misstimed it.

2482
02:51:38,950 --> 02:51:40,630
I got super impatient again.

2483
02:51:44,490 --> 02:51:45,230
My greed.

2484
02:51:45,890 --> 02:51:47,570
My greed is my hubris.

2485
02:51:48,350 --> 02:51:48,850
Yay, $20!

2486
02:51:50,790 --> 02:51:52,110
And how do I get over here?

2487
02:51:53,050 --> 02:51:53,390
What?

2488
02:51:56,450 --> 02:51:58,630
Can I not go over there yet?

2489
02:52:03,450 --> 02:52:05,430
There are greed sickens of you.

2490
02:52:11,160 --> 02:52:11,780
Alright.

2491
02:52:12,700 --> 02:52:13,320
Not yet.

2492
02:52:13,720 --> 02:52:13,720
Alright.

2493
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:15,660
Guess I leave then.

2494
02:52:16,600 --> 02:52:18,020
I'm not gonna do anything here.

2495
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:21,360
I did everything I can.

2496
02:52:25,540 --> 02:52:26,020
Alright.

2497
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:26,980
Back, I'll go.

2498
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:31,200
Now what?

2499
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:34,340
I guess I go back now?

2500
02:52:35,820 --> 02:52:37,800
There's so much... I didn't invite...

2501
02:52:37,800 --> 02:52:39,240
My only issue right now.

2502
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:41,520
There's so much backtracking.

2503
02:52:43,340 --> 02:53:01,800
because i'm lost all the time i i'm making it worse for myself and that's why there's so much backtracking i i'm just perpetually always lost even when i have a map on me

2504
02:53:06,660 --> 02:53:13,800
all right i'm gonna go to that bench wait do i have to go to that bench i'm more supposed oh fog canyon

2505
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:23,300

2507
02:53:55,140 --> 02:53:57,680
This better be the goddamn nerd.

2508
02:54:03,310 --> 02:54:03,810
What?

2509
02:54:04,130 --> 02:54:04,530
No!

2510
02:54:09,550 --> 02:54:11,370
I was like, why can't I go?

2511
02:54:11,530 --> 02:54:12,650
Let me in.

2512
02:54:13,470 --> 02:54:15,670
I was like, let me in.

2513
02:54:16,270 --> 02:54:17,610
Let me in.

2514
02:54:18,070 --> 02:54:19,590
Why wouldn't it let me in?

2515
02:54:20,870 --> 02:54:22,190
I was so confused.

2516
02:54:22,290 --> 02:54:26,890
I was like, maybe if I bash my head more, I think he will let me in.

2517
02:54:33,070 --> 02:54:34,110
Oh, okay.

2518
02:54:34,770 --> 02:54:38,130
I did that because I thought...

2519
02:54:38,710 --> 02:54:41,870
I thought it'll hit the other jellyfish, guys.

2520
02:54:42,390 --> 02:54:45,150
I legitimately thought, like, oh, that'll hit the other jellyfish, right?

2521
02:54:45,470 --> 02:54:46,230
Oh, my God.

2522
02:54:53,470 --> 02:54:56,010
Okay, I think it was this way.

2523
02:54:58,370 --> 02:55:00,050
Okay, I'm going to go to the bank real fast.

2524
02:55:05,860 --> 02:55:06,380
I'm not gonna...

2525
02:55:06,380 --> 02:55:07,860
I'm not...

2526
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:09,080
Okay.

2527
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:09,820
What?

2528
02:55:10,560 --> 02:55:11,080
Oh!

2529
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:16,680
I was like, no!

2530
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:23,320
Okay.

2531
02:55:23,960 --> 02:55:24,840
Okay, wait.

2532
02:55:25,480 --> 02:55:27,160
I don't want to go to the bank anymore.

2533
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:30,540
I don't want to go to the bank anymore.

2534
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:32,520
Oh my god, the bank is downstairs.

2535
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:33,240
I forgot.

2536
02:55:35,640 --> 02:55:36,400
I forgot.

2537
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:41,360
Okay, one HP.

2538
02:55:45,480 --> 02:55:47,040
Oh my god, where is the bank?

2539
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:49,460
Is this the bank?

2540
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:53,120
No, this is not the bank.

2541
02:55:56,300 --> 02:55:59,500
Okay, but I can't get another HP, which is five.

2542
02:56:05,890 --> 02:56:06,290
Okay.

2543
02:56:09,170 --> 02:56:15,570

02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:57,480
Is it safe there forever?

2548
02:56:58,140 --> 02:56:58,460
Yes?

2549
02:56:58,640 --> 02:56:59,520
God damn it.

2550
02:56:59,900 --> 02:57:01,460
Why can't I have a credit card?

2551
02:57:02,800 --> 02:57:04,400
What the fuck?

2552
02:57:05,380 --> 02:57:07,840
Where is my bank credit card?

2553
02:57:17,530 --> 02:57:18,150
Eh.

2554
02:57:21,430 --> 02:57:22,630
These guys are annoying.

2555
02:57:22,910 --> 02:57:24,490
Because I can't do anything about it.

2556
02:57:24,590 --> 02:57:25,750
They're just...

2557
02:57:27,210 --> 02:57:28,730
They're just spinning at me.

2558
02:57:31,390 --> 02:57:31,970
It's fine.

2559
02:57:32,030 --> 02:57:32,670
We don't need a...

2560
02:57:32,670 --> 02:57:33,550
We don't need a bench.

2561
02:57:33,750 --> 02:57:34,430
We're unstoppable.

2562
02:57:38,250 --> 02:57:39,650
Maybe miss last words.

2563
02:57:40,530 --> 02:57:40,850
It's okay.

2564
02:57:40,890 --> 02:57:41,630
We don't need it.

2565
02:57:42,050 --> 02:57:42,770
We're unstoppable.

2566
02:57:44,230 --> 02:57:44,470
Okay.

2567
02:57:44,690 --> 02:57:45,430
I'll heal here.

2568
02:57:46,310 --> 02:57:47,650
We still don't need it.

2569
02:57:51,450 --> 02:57:51,930
Okay.

2570
02:57:51,930 --> 02:57:52,330
Nice.

2571
02:57:52,990 --> 02:57:55,150
The only way to really kill these guys is the Pogo.

2572
02:57:55,530 --> 02:57:56,610
They kill them efficiently.

2573
02:58:00,090 --> 02:58:01,110
Oh my god!

2574
02:58:01,230 --> 02:58:02,010
That explodes!

2575
02:58:02,930 --> 02:58:04,410
Emiko, thank you for the super chat.

2576
02:58:04,450 --> 02:58:05,010
Thank you, thank you.

2577
02:58:05,010 --> 02:58:07,090
Like this game, you might really like Nine Souls.

2578
02:58:07,670 --> 02:58:09,170
It's a bit darker, but a lot of fun.

2579
02:58:09,590 --> 02:58:12,050
Also, bigger focus on parrying than dodging.

2580
02:58:12,770 --> 02:58:13,770
I've heard about it.

2581
02:58:13,850 --> 02:58:14,410
I've seen...

2582
02:58:14,410 --> 02:58:16,870
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2583
02:58:20,470 --> 02:58:22,290
Are these like...

2584
02:58:23,810 --> 02:58:25,290
Okay, yeah, never mind.

2585
02:58:25,410 --> 02:58:25,830
I'm leaving.

2586
02:58:27,610 --> 02:58:29,010
So, um, where is this bench?

2587
02:58:31,290 --> 02:58:32,170
Hey, guys.

2588
02:58:32,810 --> 02:58:36,410
Um, so, where is this bench that you speak of?

2589
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:43,960
Oh, my God.

2590
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:44,620
There he is.

2591
02:58:44,820 --> 02:58:45,460
Oh, my God.

2592
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:46,440
And I don't have money.

2593
02:58:46,540 --> 02:58:47,700
I put it on a bank.

2594
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:50,060
I try to invest in my future.

2595
02:58:55,900 --> 02:58:57,980
Why can't I do a higher jump?

2596
02:59:01,420 --> 02:59:02,780
This is annoying, actually.

2597
02:59:06,420 --> 02:59:07,200
Oh, Pogo?

2598
02:59:09,740 --> 02:59:10,140
Oh!

2599
02:59:11,660 --> 02:59:13,020
Okay, now I know.

2600
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:17,020
Oh my god, wait.

2601
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:18,140
That means there's money here.

2602
02:59:18,200 --> 02:59:18,380
Okay.

2603
02:59:22,740 --> 02:59:23,540

02:59:35,270 --> 02:59:35,670
Okay.

2607
02:59:36,790 --> 02:59:37,190
Okay.

02:59:39,830 --> 02:59:40,890
Oh, shit!

2609
02:59:41,430 --> 02:59:41,770
It's okay.

2610
02:59:46,690 --> 02:59:47,330
Oh, my God.

2611
02:59:47,810 --> 02:59:48,730
We got cordyceps.

2612
02:59:49,850 --> 02:59:50,790
It's last of us.

2613
02:59:54,270 --> 02:59:55,570
Where are those monsters called again?

2614
02:59:55,710 --> 02:59:55,850

2615
03:00:04,630 --> 03:00:06,070

2618
03:00:11,690 --> 03:00:13,590

I was so proud.

2622
03:00:53,420 --> 03:00:56,260
I don't even know what she's doing here.

2623
03:00:57,540 --> 03:00:58,500
Bench is on my left.

2624
03:00:59,760 --> 03:01:00,640
Where's my bench?

2625
03:01:04,240 --> 03:01:04,900
Oh, shit.

2626
03:01:08,640 --> 03:01:09,120

03:01:10,960 --> 03:01:13,620
Oh, the station.

2628
03:01:15,060 --> 03:01:16,960
The station bench, yeah.

2629
03:01:18,480 --> 03:01:19,360
Almost forgot about it.

2630
03:01:23,180 --> 03:01:24,200
Get over here.

2631
03:01:25,260 --> 03:01:25,980
Wait, actually, no.

2632
03:01:26,020 --> 03:01:27,400
I need to go back to the bank first.

2633
03:01:29,760 --> 03:01:32,480
I need to go back to the bench so I can...

2634
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:37,620
I need to go back to the bank so I can grab my money back and then buy stuff.

2635
03:01:38,740 --> 03:01:40,300
And participate in capitalism.

2636
03:01:49,370 --> 03:01:50,230
Give me a sec, guys.

2637
03:01:50,270 --> 03:01:52,390
I gotta participate in capitalism real quick.

2638
03:01:53,090 --> 03:01:55,830
They rely on me the economy.

2639
03:02:01,320 --> 03:02:04,260
I'm literally holding this entire world's economy in place.

2640
03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:08,000
Their GPD is like one dokey.

2641
03:02:12,920 --> 03:02:15,500
As long as there's no withdrawal fee, we'll be fine.

2642
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:22,760
Okay, we can buy the map from now.

2643
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:27,240
Yeah, the D and GDP stats for dokey.

2644
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:30,220
The gross dokey product.

2645
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:37,200
Okay.

2646
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:40,480
Alright.

2647
03:02:40,680 --> 03:02:41,300
I think I'm normal.

2648
03:02:41,640 --> 03:02:45,640
Ah, it's your friend who's got me at a perfect time.

2649
03:02:46,220 --> 03:02:49,140
I just about finished trying these nauseous caverns.

2650
03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:52,820
Very territorial types to make their homes in the area.

2651
03:02:53,440 --> 03:02:55,080
I suggest avoiding them where possible.

2652
03:02:55,680 --> 03:02:59,020
Right or below some strange feeling creatures give me quite a scare.

2653
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:01,600
They seem quite an intelligent bunch.

2654
03:03:02,140 --> 03:03:04,660
In my youth, I'd upgrade the caves.

2655
03:03:04,820 --> 03:03:06,100
But I feel my maturity.

2656
03:03:07,220 --> 03:03:10,580
be able to outrun me or later turn violent.

2657
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:13,320
And $75.

2658
03:03:13,840 --> 03:03:14,700
It's increasing.

2659
03:03:15,780 --> 03:03:17,680
The inflation is getting worse.

2660
03:03:19,460 --> 03:03:20,880
Okay, where am I?

2661
03:03:21,700 --> 03:03:25,120
All right, we can go down right.

2662
03:03:26,480 --> 03:03:28,460
I don't think we could go right, so...

2663
03:03:32,360 --> 03:03:35,020
You made him a creep!

2664
03:03:37,760 --> 03:03:39,920
Because he is one.

2665
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:48,160
My current suspect is Cornelius.

2666
03:03:51,800 --> 03:03:52,840
Guys, good news.

2667
03:03:53,320 --> 03:03:56,180

He is.

2669
03:04:04,940 --> 03:04:06,700
He is one of the suspects.

2670
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:12,260
What the fuck?

2671
03:04:13,400 --> 03:04:14,580
The Hall of Seal.

2672
03:04:15,700 --> 03:04:17,820
I would have expected something else.

2673
03:04:20,680 --> 03:04:21,040

2674
03:04:22,900 --> 03:04:25,140

Maybe my soul will find me before I find him.

2694
03:07:59,280 --> 03:08:01,640
So he can't speak for her.

2695

The city was not safe.

2727

I think I got robbed.

2728
03:10:44,250 --> 03:10:45,890

03:11:16,250 --> 03:11:17,670
I need the HP.

2739
03:11:20,270 --> 03:11:22,450
I'm trying to remember how to get there.

2740
03:11:24,570 --> 03:11:25,250
Are you serious?

2741
03:11:25,790 --> 03:11:27,570
How am I- I'm just getting worse.

2742
03:11:31,770 --> 03:11:34,110

What's this?

2746
03:11:49,700 --> 03:11:51,820
You can tell that I just stopped hearing.

2747
03:11:54,240 --> 03:11:56,800
I'm just letting the world take me.

2748
03:11:59,980 --> 03:12:01,220
Yeah, I remember how to get there.

2749
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:06,020
Alright, I'm locking the fuck in now.

2750
03:12:07,360 --> 03:12:09,080
At least these guys don't...

2751
03:12:15,800 --> 03:12:17,300

2753
03:12:24,820 --> 03:12:26,820
Okay, I assume they did not...

2754
03:12:26,820 --> 03:12:27,760
Okay, they respond.

2755
03:12:28,660 --> 03:12:29,200
At least...

2756
03:12:29,200 --> 03:12:31,000
Okay, I know they respond now.

2757
03:12:31,100 --> 03:12:32,740
You were about to say...

2758
03:12:33,260 --> 03:12:34,860
I was like, oh shit, that is.

2759
03:12:34,940 --> 03:12:36,240
At least they don't respond.

2760
03:12:38,540 --> 03:12:40,080
Where's my fucking ghost?

2761
03:12:41,720 --> 03:12:42,080
Wah!

2762
03:12:43,860 --> 03:12:44,760
There we go.

2763
03:12:45,940 --> 03:12:47,720
You won't get me now, Waluigi.

2764
03:12:48,820 --> 03:12:49,340
Wah!

2765
03:12:49,340 --> 03:12:49,700

2766
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:55,320
Wah!

2767
03:12:55,340 --> 03:12:55,800
Wow!

2768
03:13:01,020 --> 03:13:01,960
Okay, where am I?

2769
03:13:02,480 --> 03:13:04,620
Okay, downstairs is civilization.

2770
03:13:08,700 --> 03:13:14,620
It's crazy that I somehow managed to dodge every fucking bench possible.

2771
03:13:21,410 --> 03:13:22,810
What's over here?

2772
03:13:26,380 --> 03:13:27,040
Wow!

2773
03:13:28,840 --> 03:13:29,680
Hello?

2774
03:13:31,240 --> 03:13:31,840
Oh, hey!

2775
03:13:33,380 --> 03:13:34,340
Uh-huh.

2776
03:13:36,100 --> 03:13:36,580
creature.

2777
03:13:37,160 --> 03:13:38,660
You got the look of an adventurer.

2778
03:13:39,240 --> 03:13:40,420
So we much in common.

2779
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:43,180
Searching for dangerous places, I?

2780
03:13:43,640 --> 03:13:45,040
Well, you're on the right track.

2781
03:13:45,620 --> 03:13:48,720
A long-necked critter warned me of a tribe deeper down.

2782
03:13:49,240 --> 03:13:51,080
Warriors, sorts, so she says.

2783
03:13:51,500 --> 03:13:53,920
And I'm itching for some serious combat.

2784
03:13:54,320 --> 03:13:54,920
Oh, shit.

2785
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:56,140
I'm probably gonna have to fight them.

2786
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:01,440
What?

2787
03:14:01,520 --> 03:14:02,340
Are they friendly?

2788
03:14:03,220 --> 03:14:05,280
Maybe they're friendly warriors, you know?

2789
03:14:12,290 --> 03:14:13,810
This way I'll go.

2790
03:14:17,650 --> 03:14:17,830
Yeah.

2791
03:14:18,550 --> 03:14:18,810
Oh!

2792
03:14:19,410 --> 03:14:19,890
Fuck.

2793
03:14:23,640 --> 03:14:26,860
One time that my thing didn't hit down.

2794
03:14:28,720 --> 03:14:31,740
That looked such like a secret, but it wasn't.

2795
03:14:33,280 --> 03:14:34,440
Jesus Christ.

2796
03:14:36,700 --> 03:14:38,040
Where do I go?

2797
03:14:39,640 --> 03:14:40,160
No!

2798
03:14:43,880 --> 03:14:44,880
Okay, nice.

2799
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:46,600
Ewa, thank you for the raid.

2800
03:14:46,880 --> 03:14:47,020
Thank you.

2801
03:14:47,360 --> 03:14:47,840
Thank you.

2802
03:14:47,980 --> 03:14:49,160
I hope you have a good stream.

2803
03:14:49,900 --> 03:14:51,900
Okay, so I got a shortcut here.

2804
03:14:53,900 --> 03:14:55,240
Okay, so this is just a shortcut.

2805
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:56,380
That's okay.

2806
03:14:56,400 --> 03:14:57,800
I don't want to go through that again.

2807
03:14:58,120 --> 03:14:59,460
This is a terrible shortcut.

2808
03:15:02,480 --> 03:15:04,020
I already go through this area.

2809
03:15:08,360 --> 03:15:10,300
Okay, I'm going to look down now.

2810
03:15:10,660 --> 03:15:12,840
Because I don't trust myself anymore.

2811
03:15:15,380 --> 03:15:17,020
Gamers do look down, chat.

2812
03:15:18,460 --> 03:15:19,580
It's a miracle.

2813
03:15:21,620 --> 03:15:26,100
This game has instilled so much PTSD in me that I've started looking down.

2814
03:15:26,480 --> 03:15:27,860
Oh my god, Jane Silk-Song!

2815
03:15:34,020 --> 03:15:35,560
I can't believe it.

2816
03:15:37,860 --> 03:15:40,120
Doki has finally started looking down.

2817
03:15:45,780 --> 03:15:47,020
Yeah, I need that, please.

2818
03:15:51,960 --> 03:15:52,840
I will go this way.

2819
03:15:52,980 --> 03:15:55,160
I know she went that way, but I'm gonna go this way.

2820
03:15:56,360 --> 03:15:56,780
I should know.

2821
03:15:56,840 --> 03:15:57,460
I should go this way.

2822
03:15:57,480 --> 03:15:57,820
away.

2823
03:15:58,520 --> 03:15:59,060
After money.

2824
03:16:02,140 --> 03:16:04,260
After money, I'll go to her now.

2825
03:16:06,940 --> 03:16:07,980
I thought you killed Silk Song.

2826
03:16:08,080 --> 03:16:10,260
I've only delayed it for another year.

2827
03:16:10,580 --> 03:16:12,940
But if I kill her again, I can delay it for two years.

2828
03:16:16,820 --> 03:16:17,180
Okay.

2829
03:16:17,880 --> 03:16:18,560
Is this a city?

2830
03:16:19,080 --> 03:16:20,500
Here ends the pilgrim's way.

2831
03:16:20,820 --> 03:16:22,840
Paul Ness' hearts lays open before you.

2832
03:16:22,960 --> 03:16:25,000
Proceed onward to share in its glory.

2833
03:16:26,940 --> 03:16:27,740
Okay, yeah.

2834
03:16:29,260 --> 03:16:31,240
Toki, what were we- I- I don't know.

2835
03:16:31,540 --> 03:16:36,520
I- I was like, maybe- maybe someone will pick me up.

2836
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:39,320
You know?

2837
03:16:45,370 --> 03:16:45,890
Alright.

2838
03:16:50,780 --> 03:16:52,380
Well, I guess I'll go this way.

2839
03:16:52,540 --> 03:16:53,440
I haven't been here yet.

2840
03:16:55,520 --> 03:16:57,520
I hate these guys so much.

2841
03:16:59,460 --> 03:16:59,980
Oh!

2842
03:17:02,400 --> 03:17:03,100
Oh no.

2843
03:17:05,380 --> 03:17:05,820
Alright.

2844
03:17:07,440 --> 03:17:08,660
I'll grab his money.

2845
03:17:09,680 --> 03:17:10,540
And then we'll go this way.

2846
03:17:11,360 --> 03:17:11,880
Oh, wait, no.

2847
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:13,320
This way is...

2848
03:17:13,840 --> 03:17:14,280
Wait.

2849
03:17:14,660 --> 03:17:16,740
I have never been here, though.

2850
03:17:16,840 --> 03:17:18,620
So where does this way lead me to?

2851
03:17:24,500 --> 03:17:25,340
Oh, fuck.

2852
03:17:25,620 --> 03:17:26,380
Okay, that's on me.

2853
03:17:28,220 --> 03:17:29,080
Oh, shit.

2854
03:17:29,620 --> 03:17:30,640
That's on me, too.

2855
03:17:31,740 --> 03:17:32,360
Oh, my God.

2856
03:17:32,400 --> 03:17:33,160
It's just vibrating.

2857
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:37,580
Where am I?

2858
03:17:38,120 --> 03:17:38,780
Where am I?

2859
03:17:40,520 --> 03:17:41,780
Sure cut a head?

2860
03:17:50,460 --> 03:17:52,900
It sucks because I have...

2861
03:17:52,900 --> 03:17:53,760
Okay, how...

2862
03:17:53,760 --> 03:17:55,020
Okay, wait, I got it.

2863
03:17:56,440 --> 03:17:57,320
There you go.

2864
03:17:58,420 --> 03:17:59,940
I had a feeling that that's what I had to do.

2865
03:18:02,140 --> 03:18:02,760
Nice, $20.

2866
03:18:04,180 --> 03:18:04,480
Yay!

2867
03:18:11,700 --> 03:18:13,500
Alright, where does this lead me?

2868
03:18:14,800 --> 03:18:15,700
More money.

2869
03:18:16,240 --> 03:18:17,400
That's always a good thing.

2870
03:18:18,840 --> 03:18:19,360
Money?

2871
03:18:19,660 --> 03:18:20,640
No, paycheque.

2872
03:18:23,640 --> 03:18:25,280
You and I are different.

2873
03:18:33,990 --> 03:18:35,290
Alright, we got the shortcut.

2874
03:18:36,350 --> 03:18:38,570
So that means we can go here now.

2875
03:18:41,530 --> 03:18:44,230
Okay, so I clearly can't wall ride yet.

2876
03:18:49,680 --> 03:18:50,000
Hello.

2877
03:18:50,280 --> 03:18:51,600
Oh, shit, not friend!

2878
03:18:55,620 --> 03:18:58,040

2883
03:21:18,780 --> 03:21:22,340
I feel like I've dodged every bench in existence.

2884
03:21:25,480 --> 03:21:25,840
Oh my god.

2885
03:21:26,220 --> 03:21:28,220
While you're seeking death, welcome.

2886
03:21:28,880 --> 03:21:30,960
May you find Swift N upon our cloud.

2887

2888
03:21:37,840 --> 03:21:38,640

2889
03:21:38,680 --> 03:21:39,600

Okay, okay, it's this way.

03:22:18,160 --> 03:22:19,080
Oh my god, there's the side.

There it is.

2897
03:22:20,320 --> 03:22:20,980
I see it.

2898
03:22:21,580 --> 03:22:23,600
We finally found our first bench.

2899
03:22:24,880 --> 03:22:25,980
Oh, there it is.

03:22:26,080 --> 03:22:28,760
Alright, let's check the... Okay, I can upgrade one more.

Okay, I can put one more charm.

Lash is up.

2903
03:22:32,720 --> 03:22:33,700
One tates about tiny.

2904
03:22:33,900 --> 03:22:35,640
The shell is not indestructible.

2905
03:22:35,960 --> 03:22:36,700
Okay, we need this.

2906
03:22:36,780 --> 03:22:37,040
Alright.
