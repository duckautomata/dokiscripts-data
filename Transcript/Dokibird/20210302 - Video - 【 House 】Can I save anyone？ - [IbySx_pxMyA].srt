00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,220
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:17,820
Hi FreshLiquid, Roy, Dylan, Michael, Astral, Reeze, Pug, Victor, Ruby, Rez, Ed, hi everyone!

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:27,140
Okay so, when I started, when I picked this game, and also hey Stevie, when I picked this game I was like, oh it looks cute!

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,880
That looks cute, cause I saw someone else playing, and I was like, oh that looks so cute, look it's pixel art, and like she's in a house.

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,680
And, oh it's like an adventure game, it's like a puzzle game.

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,320
And then I was like, I'm gonna play this on stream.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:48,680
And then I, um, I put the tags down on the stream, I was changing categories, and the first tag that showed up was horror.

8
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,740
And I was like, how is this horror?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,760
It's a fucking pixel game, how do you make pixels scary?

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,700
So I was like, oh fuck!

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,360
I mean, it's kind of puzzle game, with more panic I guess.

12
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,320
Oh shit, puzzles and horror, oh no!

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
That's the worst combination!

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,980
So I...

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,820
Hey, how is she, also thank you so much for the follow up prototype, I do appreciate it, thank you, thank you.

16
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,200
Have a, have a blood heart, thank you so much.

17
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,480
Alright, so apparently I'm gonna be doing puzzles, with a time limit.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,660
And it's gonna be scary, so all three things, all my worst traits, combine together.

19
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,360
That's great.

20
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,460
That's...

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,580
That's great.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,120
I'm very much looking forward to it.

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,060
So, we're not, you're not late yet, I haven't started the play through yet.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,500
Um, cause I wanna like procrastinate a bit.

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,780
Cause apparently the game's like 30 minutes long, and there's like a time limit.

26
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,380
So I basically have 30 minutes, to not die.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,060
Uh, which, that means there's gonna be many attempts.

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,440
There's gonna be many attempts on this.

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,420
Cause there's a time limit too, and it's 30 minutes.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,980
So I don't fucking know, how, how I'm gonna go through this.

31
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,120
Cause, first off there's puzzles in there, and I'm gonna get chased.

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,140
And then, I'm somehow gonna have to like make sure, you know what, I don't even care if I get the worst ending.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,360
I just wanna finish this game.

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,360
I don't even...

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,240
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get the worst fucking ending.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,640
Also hey Classic!

37
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,560
Alright, alright, are you guys ready?

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,080
Are you guys ready for me to start the game?

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,680
I'm not ready.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,180
I have no idea what, what, what the plot of the story is.

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,920
I just know there's a...

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,040
You're a girl, it's pixel art, and it's spooky.

43
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,060
And that's all I know.

44
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm trying to time this, sleep before the trip tomorrow, me right now sleeping in the plane.

45
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,280
It is oof.

46
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,240
Alright, alright, alright.

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,360
Spooky pixel art.

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,380
Oh, oh, okay.

49
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,580
Okay, alright, alright, let's go.

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,680
Oh, hey.

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,360
Oh.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,060
Oh, I'm here.

53
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,740
How do I move?

54
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,100
Arrow keys?

55
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,180
Who the fuck uses arrow keys?

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,500
What the fuck?

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,600
Hey.

58
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,120
I'm a cute girl.

59
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,090
Alright, okay, we don't read here.

60
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,830
Oh, they used the watch...

61
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,370
We're not, no gacha today!

62
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,090
Oh, Astra!

63
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,850
So apparently there's like a time too.

64
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,090
So it's nine...

65
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,210
Okay, it's 9.50.

66
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,210
There's no gacha today, Astra!

67
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,030
I'm sorry!

68
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,510
Fucking get scammed!

69
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,550
Also, should I be like looking at the...

70
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,830
Alright, how do I open the door?

71
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,590
Shift to sprint?

72
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,010
Oh!

73
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:42,790
Ruff!

74
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,230
Hey.

75
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,130
Here you go, Ruff, just for you.

76
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,530
Get scammed, Astra.

77
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,030
Are you hungry?

78
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,410
I'll make some sandwiches.

79
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,090
Okay.

80
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,070
What's in here?

81
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,470
Oh, you're hungry.

82
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,210
Thank you so much for the follow, Artenza.

83
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,610
I do appreciate it.

84
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,110
Thank you, thank you.

85
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,710
Have a...

86
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,530
I know there's a time limit, but fuck it.

87
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,410
Dude, this is a 30 minute...

88
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,990
I can't believe you've done this.

89
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,970
I wish I could stay longer, but I don't wanna go to sleep.

90
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,970
Alright, it's okay, Ed.

91
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,730
I do appreciate you coming...

92
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,150
Oh, hey, cat.

93
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:14,910
Meow.

94
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,270
I do appreciate you coming over and hanging out with us.

95
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,590
Oh shit, what the fuck?

96
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,530
I wanna know if dad will come home at midnight and you have a mom and a sister.

97
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,830
Well, I apparently have a cat too.

98
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,190
I don't know if he's gonna come home at midnight.

99
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,090
Okay, wait, give me a sec, guys.

100
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,530
I need to turn the volume down.

101
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,510
It is so fucking loud in my ears.

102
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,730
I can pour

103
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,140
this?

104
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,960
What do I do with this?

105
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,000
Is this milk?

106
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,260
What am I holding?

107
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,450
Wait, how do I...

108
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,350
Oh, I got a key.

109
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:50,830
Wait, no.

110
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,990
How do I get a key?

111
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,410
Key?

112
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,450
Oh, key.

113
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:58,940
Hey.

114
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,940
I hate this house.

115
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,040
Alright, fine.

116
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm gonna go to bed.

117
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,960
Oh, wait.

118
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,480
I can...

119
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:06,960
Item?

120
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,240
Yeah, a little card.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,820
Where do I go?

122
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,770
Okay, so...

123
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:29,950
Oh, oh.

124
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,130
Oh, god.

125
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,110
No, please, please.

126
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,750
Oh.

127
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,010
Oh, okay.

128
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,210
Okay, bye.

129
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,440
Check it out.

130
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,120
What's this?

131
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,820
Yeah.

132
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,040
Oh, it's the crystal ball, guys.

133
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,840
It's just you start the game.

134
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,000
Alright, so...

135
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,140
We don't go in there.

136
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,620
We don't go in the rat room.

137
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,660
I've learned that rat room is dangerous.

138
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,980
The rat room is a no-no room.

139
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,120
I'm watching you sleep.

140
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,340
That's not creepy at all.

141
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,020
I don't have siblings, so I don't know if it's... Is it normal to watch your siblings sleep?

142
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,440
Because I don't have... I'm an only child, so I don't know.

143
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,300
I don't know if that's a normal thing to do.

144
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm gonna have dinner, so I'll be lurking.

145
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,380
Alright, alright.

146
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,120
I need the milk.

147
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,040
You don't really have a choice when you share a room.

148
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,480
So do you watch your sister sleep when you're in the room?

149
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,340
That's really creepy.

150
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,840
I'm also an only child.

151
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,710
How do I pick up items?

152
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,410
Oh, hey.

153
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,710
Alright, so I learned that I don't go into that room.

154
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,390
That room is a no-no room.

155
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,950
Wait, okay, but like... My mom's gonna make me food, right?

156
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,210
Okay...

157
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,930
Where the fuck do I go?

158
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,970
Where the fuck do I go with this key?

159
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,750
There's only like three doors.

160
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,970
Here?

161
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,030
Like, how big is this house?

162
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,870
How big is this fucking house?

163
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,230
What?

164
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,590
There's only like seven rooms.

165
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,070
I don't know how to count though.

166
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,690
I assume there's like seven...

167
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,370
Okay, okay, if I pick this up and then I leave...

168
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,650
I should be fine, right?

169
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,910
Press space to open the...

170
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,470
Okay, I have a bucket.

171
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,910
What the fuck do I do with a bucket?

172
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,230
Okay...

173
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,200
I am so fucking...

174
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Please, can I have some food now?

175
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,840
Please, mom.

176
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,000
Can I have some more?

177
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,520
Can I have some...

178
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,020
Oh shi- Oh!

179
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,420
Okay...

180
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,300
Are you okay?

181
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,260
Are you okay?

182
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,340
I'm so okay.

183
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,020
Oh!

184
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,840
That's what the bucket was for!

185
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,420
Well, I tried.

186
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,140
That's what the bucket was for!

187
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,600
Oh, my sister's dead too!

188
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,200
Oh!

189
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,240
Oh, my sister's dead too!

190
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,860
Whoops!

191
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,980
I'm not a very good...

192
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,760
I'm not a...

193
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,060
I'm not a very good child.

194
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,180
You don't...

195
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,960
Oh, hey there.

196
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,400
What is this?

197
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,260
Oh.

198
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,180
Okay.

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,540
Oh, hey there.

200
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,360
Oh and Shadow Man?

201
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,540
Hey Shadow Man!

202
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,920
Apparently

203
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,520
I'm not very good at saving people.

204
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,380
I'm not very good at this.

205
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,800
At least she died.

206
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,920
Why you sad?

207
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,100
Don't you hate it when that happens?

208
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,240
Man, don't you hate it when you slip and you just die?

209
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,000
Don't you just hate that?

210
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,440
Okay, okay, I got this.

211
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
I got this.

212
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,860
Okay, I need to give milk, milkies to the cat.

213
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,140
How was I supposed to know this is a puddle?

214
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
It's just fucking three thingies!

215
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,340
It's just like three dots on the floor!

216
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,560
What the fuck?

217
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,700
What child would know what that is?

218
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,720
Thank you so much for the follow milkshake.

219
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,660

Maybe we can get some- dude I already- I used the- I used the lizard.

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,960
They've already died so- Excuse me?

225
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,320
Oh my god.

226
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,960
I gave you milk and this is how you repay me?

227
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,440
Oh okay, nevermind.

228
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,060
Good cat.

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,580
Wait, how do I pick up?

230
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,580
Oh, hey.

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,560
Okay.

Alright.

234
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,200
Okay, but like- Where did I get the bucket again?

235
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,840
Oh, hey sis.

236
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,980
Oh yeah, I can like look through- look through the things, right?

I am so fucking confused.

238
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,700
I am so fucking confused.

239
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,040
How is this a 30 minute game?

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,900
People already died in like less than five minutes.

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,660
I don't understand how people can play this game for 30 minutes.

242
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,980
I don't understand how people can play this game for 30 minutes.

243
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,720
People already died in like five minutes.

244
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,720
People already died in like five minutes.

245
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,200
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, Shadow Man!

Oh shit, wait, wait, I need to get the bucket.

I need to save my mom.

257

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,780
How do I-

260
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,310
Okay.

261
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,910
How do I pick you up?

Okay.

272
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,340
Bye.

273
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,680
I'm not very good at this, guys.

274
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

275
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,280
Gotta get the bucket.

Okay, well, she's- Hey, she didn't die!

If I keep slipping on it.

Oh, if I keep slipping on it, will it dry out?

334
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,010
Will it dry?

335
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,530
Maybe I keep slipping.

336
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,330
Okay, alright, mom.

337
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:51,790

Oh my god, I'm so smart!

I had to keep slipping!

354
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,690
I had to keep slipping on it to save her!

355
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,150
Holy shit!

356
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,210
I am the fucking smartest gamer out there.

Okay.

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,170
I'm gonna drop it here for the rat.

366
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:06,890
Ratty!

367
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:07,850
Rat!

368
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,590
I got you food, rat!

369
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,670
I got you food!

370
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,230
Please eat my food!

371
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:12,550
Yeah!

372
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:12,930
Oh.

373
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,410
Alright, you know what?

374
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,390
I wanted to be an only child.

375
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,730
I wanted to be an only child anyway.

376
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,590
Shit!

377
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,430
It's okay.

378
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,150
I wanted to be an only child.

379
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,790
I'm okay with that.

380
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,210
He's such a fallabury!

381
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:39,790
Oh!

382
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,490
Cat, are you okay?

383
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,750
What's that?

384
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,550
Cat?

385
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,390
Is cat okay?

386
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,170
Oh, cat's dead!

387
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,150
Oh shit!

388
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,290
Wait, cat's dead!

389
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,490
Wait!

390
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,610
Oh!

391
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,630
Oh!

392
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,730
I'm so sorry!

393
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,230
Wait, where's mom?

394
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,630
Mom?

395
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,010
Oh, no!

396
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,290
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

397
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,800
What does this do?

398
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:28,920
Swing?

399
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,800
Let me swing.

400
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,920
Hey.

401
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,900
Mom?

402
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,940
Oh.

403
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,580
You've never played our heart game.

404
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,560
You hear our play.

405
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,200
Why do you lie?

406
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,340
I think, I think I got bored.

407
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Oh, don't.

408
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,860
Well then.

409
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:58,940
Oh.

410
00:17:59,560 --> 00:17:59,860
Oh.

411
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,720
Now I understand how this took 30 minutes to fucking play.

412
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,620
Damn, she bored me.

413
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,480
Okay, alright.

414
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,080
I now know how to save my mom.

415
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,860
I don't know what to do with my sister though.

416
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,360
I don't think I need a sister.

417
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,880
I, I, I don't think I need a sister, so that's okay.

418
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,630
Drink the milk.

419
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,210
Wake up.

420
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,610
I don't think I need a sister, so that's okay.

421
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,110
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty perfect with this.

422
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,310
Yeah, sisters are optional.

423
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,550
We don't need a sister.

424
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,350
That means more presents for me.

425
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,470
I mean, I don't know what it's like to have siblings, and I think I like, I like being an only child.

426
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,790
She keeps getting squished.

427
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,400
I think, I think like, being an only child is pretty fun.

428
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,440
I get to have Wait, I was gonna say something really fucked up.

429
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,920
I'm saying like, what are you gonna do?

430
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,540
Huh?

431
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,780
I'm their only child.

432
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,060
They can't do shit.

433
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,680
They can only rely on me.

434
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,900
Hey, Rain!

435
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,820
Okay, I need to cycle the items.

436
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,840
Okay, and I gotta slip on it.

437
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,880
I gotta slip on it, so... Hey, Taylor!

438
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,160
Okay, if I slip on it, it'll be okay.

439
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,800
I just gotta keep slipping.

440
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,920
I just gotta keep slipping.

441
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,960
Just gotta keep slipping.

442
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,660
Sorry, this makes you feel incurred by my now.

443
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,000
Okay.

444
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,700
Alright, alright.

445
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,940
Okay, and then...

446
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,640
And then what do I do?

447
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,160
Pick it up?

448
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,930
What if I just do this?

449
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,130
Oh.

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,510
Okay, apparently not like that.

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,970
Okay, and then I just gotta keep slipping.

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,450
Also, these were your little follow, Taylor.

453
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,430
I do appreciate it.

454
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,090
Thank you, thank you.

455
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,870
Alright, Mom.

456
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,270
Mom, make me some sandwiches.

457
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,070

Alright, rat.

Okay, okay.

Well, she's dead now.

472
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,710

476
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,410
I don't... I don't care about you.

477
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,990
Alright, anyway.

478
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,430
There's a fucking...

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

480
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,870
Rat, rat, rat, rat, rat, rat.

00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,670
Eat the sandwich.

483
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,130
Yes, yes, yes.

484
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,590
There we go.

485
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,250
Alright.

Alright, we don't care about the...

491
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,990
the girl.

492
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,290
Okay, so the cat's alive.

493
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,350
Do you remember me?

494
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,870
I actually don't, Mike.

495
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,870

496
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,230
I'm sorry.

497
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,290
Alright.

498
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,110
And now we gotta swing...

500
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,370
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

What?

505
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,910
What's that sound?

506
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,640
Oh, I have another sandwich.

507
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,840
Can I pick up the sandwich?

508
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,080
No.

509
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,250
Alright, let's... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Oh, okay.

513
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,510
Never mind.

514
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,390
Hey, Arlo!

515
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,090
How the fuck do you beat this game?

516
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,030
I don't understand!

517
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,470
How do...

518
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,990
How do I beat this game?

519
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,530
Do I just stay in the rat room?

520
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,050
I'm just gonna stay in the rat room.

521
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,230
I'm just gonna...

522
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,030
Alright, I don't know how to save the sister.

523
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,570
I don't know how to save the mom.

524
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,110
As long as I save the cat, that's all that matters.

525
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,510
That's all that fucking matters.

526
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,270
I just need to save the cat.

527
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,530
All is safe in the rat room.

528
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,390
Alright, just stay in the rat room.

529
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,430
The rat room is safe.

530
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,270
But like...

531
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,910
Alright, cat.

532
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,750
The rat and the cat are the only family we need.

533
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,350
Apparently it is...

534
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,410
Apparently Apparently Apparently it is a horror game.

535
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,350
Oh look, he's going to follow Firestone.

536
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,510
I do appreciate it.

537
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:20,950
Thank you, thank you.

538
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:21,810
Alright, cat.

539
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,650
Get the fuck up.

540
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,030
Cat, I need the...

541
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,770

Cat.

543
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:26,870
Oh, there we go.

544
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,370
There's cat.

545
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:28,830
Okay.

546
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,210
Alright, then I need a bucket.

547
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,130
Like in the only child simulator.

548
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,090
I mean, you're not wrong.

549
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,030
I mean, you're not wrong.

550
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,130
You're not wrong.

551
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,130
You're not wrong about this.

552
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,510
You're not wrong about that.

553
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,350
Alright.

554
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,930
Okay, I just need to slip on it a few times.

555
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,550
I just need to slip on it a few times.

556
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,090
There we go.

557
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,110
Okay.

558
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,550
What happens if I turn off the lights?

559
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,770
Alright, green.

560
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,110
Thanks for hanging out with us.

561
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,870
I do appreciate it.

562
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,590
Thank you, thank you.

563
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,910
How do I do this?

564
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,490
Can I...

565
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,590
Can I push the...

566
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,910
No, I can't.

567
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,630
I guess we'll...

568
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,730
Bye, sister.

569
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,510
Hahahaha.

570
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,390
Guess I don't have a sister anymore.

571
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:16,110
Guess I don't have a sister anymore.

572
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,090
Bye-bye.

573
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,110
I need that sandwich.

574
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,110
Ummm...

575
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,350
What the fuck do I...

576
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,150
Wait, what's this bullet about?

577
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,190
Oh!

578
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,490
Do I do...

579
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,580
What do I do here?

580
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,340
Well then, bye.

581
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,480
Bye.

582
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,100
Hahahaha.

583
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,840
I guess I do that.

584
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,260
Well, we don't have a sister anymore.

585
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,600
So that's okay.

586
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,400
Alright, bye.

587
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,460
Oh shit, wait.

588
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,140
I need to pick this up.

589
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,240
Alright.

590
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,110
Yeah, my cat's my family now.

591
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,510
Bye, sister.

592
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,650
Please, please eat this sandwich.

593
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,150
Oh, thank you, thank you.

594
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,550
Oh!

595
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:14,570
Oh!

596
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,830
Oh, I'm sorry!

597
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,630
Oh, no!

598
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,270
No!

599
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:17,870
Please!

600
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:18,570
Hahahaha.

601
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,170
Please, I just wanna make it.

602
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,830
I just wanna... I just wanna be saved.

603
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,510
Hahahaha.

604
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,610
Hahahaha.

605
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,570
Please, I just wanna be saved.

606
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,210
Hahahaha.

607
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,410
Chatelman.

608
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:34,970
Hahahaha.

609
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,330
Hahahaha.

610
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,950
How many times do I have to do this?

611
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,050
How do people speedrun this game?

612
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,350
Hahahaha.

613
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,630
How do you do it?

614
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:46,650
Hahahaha.

615
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,370
Hahahaha.

616
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Okay, alright.

617
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,820
Trial and error.

618
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,720
Hahahaha.

619
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,880
There is a lot of trial and error.

620
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,380
There's a lot of errors.

621
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,360
There's a lot of errors.

622
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,660
Hahahaha.

623
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,460
Oh, oh, oh.

624
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,960
Okay.

625
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,960
Hahahaha.

626
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,020
Hahahaha.

627
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:16,910
Okay.

628
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,610
Oh!

629
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:17,930
No!

630
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,630
Alright, we don't need... we don't need rat room.

631
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,070
We don't need rat room.

632
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:24,570
Hahahaha.

633
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:25,970
Hahahaha.

634
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,890
Fuck you, cat.

635
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,030
I fucked it up already.

636
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,190
Hahahaha.

637
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,030
Hahahaha.

638
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,750
Okay, if I keep doing this, will the ghost be angry?

639
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:37,650
Hahahaha.

640
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:40,750
It's okay.

641
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,590
We don't need rat.

642
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,490
We don't need...

643
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,610
Who's own house?

644
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,810
I have several complaints.

645
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,190
You know what?

646
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,150
I... Okay, I just realized.

647
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,130
Wait, can I die from this?

648
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,670
Oh, I can.

649
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,150
Ah.

650
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,730
Well then.

651
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,450
Hahahaha.

652
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,250
Well then.

653
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,050
I can die from this.

654
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,570
Okay.

655
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,450
Alright.

656
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,190
Alright, alright, alright.

657
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,150
Speedrun.

658
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,030
Let's speedrun this.

659
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,750
Wait, I can't believe we've only been streaming this game for five minutes, chat.

660
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,150
Holy shit, I am a fucking guy.

661
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:16,750
Alright.

662
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,850
We need this.

663
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,290
And then...

664
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:20,890
My cat.

665
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,690
Please.

666
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,830
Here we go.

667
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,610
And then...

668
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,030
And then...

669
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,790
Wake up.

670
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,190
Hey, Muffy!

671
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,450
Okay, and then...

672
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,310
I drop you here.

673
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,770
And then I need to get the milk.

674
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,670
I might go doing... Like, I am actually like doing this on autopilot now.

675
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,470
Hahahaha.

676
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,010
This is on fucking autopilot.

677
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,310
Please.

678
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,710
Cat, wake up.

679
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,890
Cat, please.

680
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,650
I need the key.

681
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,270
Please, cat.

682
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,950
Please.

683
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:53,890
Hahahaha.

684
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,850
This is an actual speedrun now.

685
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,590
Alright.

686
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,610
Bike rat.

687
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,670
Okay, and then I need a...

688
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,050
What a lovely house.

689
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,290
Only... only twelve horrific murders took place.

690
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:10,930
Exactly.

691
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,450
Only twelve.

692
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,330
I think we have a very good track record.

693
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,410
It's only twelve...

694
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,070
twelve deaths.

695
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,010
Not that much.

696
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,050
What the fuck do I do here?

697
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,570
I want to save my... Okay, I don't really give a shit about my sister.

698
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,610
But like...

699
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:28,850
Hahahaha.

700
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,290
It would be nice if my sister didn't die.

701
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:33,410
Omni!

702
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,870
Thank you so much for the...

703
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,470
for the... for the raid!

704
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,570
Thank you, thank you.

705
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,150
Okay, sister.

706
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,350
Sister, please.

707
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:40,930
Sister, please.

708
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,050
Oh, what if I just keep talking to you?

709
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,530
Sister, if I keep talking to you, will you not die?

710
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,130
Do you have a good stream, Omni?

711
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,750
Alright.

712
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,430
If I keep talking to you, will you be okay?

713
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,210
Look.

714
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,570
I hate what he did.

715
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,310
I hate these walls.

716
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,310
But if I keep talking to you, you'll be alive, right?

717
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,110
Hahahaha.

718
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,450
Please, don't die!

719
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,670
Hahahaha.

720
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,910
Please, stop playing the piano.

721
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,750
Hahahaha.

722
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,030
If you just stop playing... Oh shit, wait, wait, wait.

723
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,490
I just realized.

724
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,290
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

725
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,490
Oh, I think she's gonna die from this.

726
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,490
Oh, she's fine.

727
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,210
Okay.

728
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,850
And I can't... I can't...

729
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,630
die, right?

730
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,110
Exactly!

731
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:25,610
Hahahaha.

732
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,670
Isn't that how it works?

733
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,110
Hahahaha.

734
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,810
What the fuck is this frog doing here?

735
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,790
What do I do with this frog?

736
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,250
You saved her?

737
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,990
Hahahaha.

738
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,370
Masaya, thank you so much for the follow.

739
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,170
Thank you, thank you.

740
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,010
Have a blood heart.

741
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,070
Have some blood hearts.

742
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:44,790
Alright.

743
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,390
Oh, Shadow Man.

744
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,270
Hey, Shadow Man.

745
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,620
I don't know how to pick the frog up.

746
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,340
Well, we don't give a fuck about the frog.

747
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:54,880
Apparently.

748
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,860
So...

749
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,800
Oh, hey there.

750
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,520
So the sister's gonna die.

751
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,620
And I don't know what to do about that.

752
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,240
I don't know what I can do about the sister's death.

753
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,300
Hahahaha.

754
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,320
She's dead.

755
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,720
Hahahaha.

756
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,180
Now eat your sandwich.

757
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,920
Wait, wait, wait!

758
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,380
I... There's the sandwich!

759
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,980
Please!

760
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
Just eat the sandwich!

761
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,800
Hahahaha.

762
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:21,860
Hahahaha.

763
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,920
Alright.

764
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,300
So, that was karma.

765
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,820
Cause I was like, bye bye sister.

766
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,680
And I...

767
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,320
You stole your little follow, Hannah.

768
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:32,680
Alright.

769
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,040
Dude, how the fuck...

770
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,980
You said you were meeting in the sun.

771
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,540
How the fuck do you do this?

772
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,240
I... I...

773
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,860
Everyone just keeps dying!

774
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,280
You're my little frog champ.

775
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,660
Why do people keep dying around me?

776
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,600
I don't understand.

777
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,420
I don't understand.

778
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,500
Alright.

779
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,740
And then here's the milk.

780
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,500
I don't

781
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,670
know what to do with you.

782
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,190
Ummm...

783
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,990
What do I do with you?

784
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:10,650
Hahahaha.

785
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,570
Here you go.

786
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:12,730
Hahahaha.

787
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,110
Cat, wake up.

788
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,870
I need the key.

789
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,370
I don't... I've been playing for 36 minutes.

790
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,430
I've been doing this for 36 minutes.

791
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,690
Is this insanity?

792
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,670
Is this... I thought I could...

793
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,170
I just wanted to get an ending.

794
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,230
I don't care how many people die.

795
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,550
I just want this game to end.

796
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:29,610
Hahahaha.

797
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:30,810
Hahahaha.

798
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,270
I don't care how many people die.

799
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,010
I just want this game to end.

800
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,910
Hahahaha.

801
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,360
Ohhh, I should...

802
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,980
Okay, then she's gonna die through the bear trap!

803
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:51,710
I don't care how many people I sacrifice.

804
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,810
I just want to end this game.

805
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,590
I just want this game to end.

806
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,290
Hey, please, please...

807
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,030
Please stop.

808
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,490
Okay, so I got everything I need.

809
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,010
I just don't know how to... is she gonna die?

810
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,710
Well then, at least she's okay.

811
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,890
At least she's not crushed.

812
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,130
That's alright.

813
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,510
She's okay.

814
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,150
She's okay.

815
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,070
Oh shit, do I crush the frog?

816
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,230
Alright, frog.

817
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,530
I'm sorry.

818
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,090
Oh.

819
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,370
Well then.

820
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,690
It's okay, I saved her.

821
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,610
She's safe.

822
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,730
And then I take this, and then...

823
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,710
It's okay.

824
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,470
She's okay.

825
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,970
I think being... I think dying from a bear trap is... look, she's happy.

826
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:51,850
Oh!

827
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,030
Oh, she's not happy!

828
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,190
She's not happy!

829
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,870
I don't think she was...

830
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,070
I don't think she was happy, guys.

831
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,830
Okay, she was definitely not happy.

832
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

833
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,650
I'm sorry.

834
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:28,370
Okay, so what I've learned was that she was... she was not happy.

835
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,430
She was definitely not...

836
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,170
Oh, please!

837
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,090
I can't run!

838
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,150
Oh, no!

839
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,210
Please.

840
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,830
Alright, eat the... eat the sandwich.

841
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,670
Please eat the sandwich.

842
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,830
Oh, oh, no!

843
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,430
Please don't!

844
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,380
Why can't you eat the sandwich?

845
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,800
Why can't you eat the sandwich?

846
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,480
All I want you to do is eat!

847
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,920
Why can't you eat?

848
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,180
You're making... I thought I got it down.

849
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,400
I thought I got everything down!

850
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,440
Thank you so much for the follow.

851
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,400
You appreciate it.

852
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,760
Thank you.

853
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,120
Thank you.

854
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,960
Alright.

855
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,760
Okay, I got this down.

856
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,880
Did he just... oh, you just rubbed your face too close to the mouth.

857
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,320
Okay.

858
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,880
How do I even save her?

859
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,600
I don't understand.

860
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,320
What do I do with this?

861
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,840
Okay, if I put it here, it should be okay, right?

862
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,400
Alright, I... I'll... I'll put this here for now.

863
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,100
And then...

864
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,140
Okay, alright, alright.

865
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,900
Come on, cat.

866
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,220
Hook up!

867
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:04,920
Thank you.

868
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,620
Okay, and then I got to go get...

869
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,520
Easy ride.

870
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,180
This is my turn.

871
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,340
I just wanted to be an only child!

872
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,060
Is my mom still here?

873
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,520
Is my mom gonna die?

874
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,940
Oh no, she's okay.

875
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,880
Is that too much to ask for?

876
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,080
I just wanted to be an only child.

877
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,820
I'm gonna call it here.

878
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,980
My back is killing me today.

879
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,420
Have fun.

880
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,060
Don't murder anyone else.

881
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,760
Oh, I don't know about that.

882
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,280
Can I kill a cat here?

883
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
No, I shouldn't.

884
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,500
The cat's the only one I know how to keep alive.

885
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,220
No, you feed the rat the sandwich.

886
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,480
But then I don't know what else to do after that.

887
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,880
I don't know how to save my sister.

888
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,400
So, it's okay.

889
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,620
We don't care about her.

890
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,140
We just want the sandwiches.

891
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,210
I can!

892
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,330
I tried to.

893
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,510
I tried to crush it.

894
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,130
Alright, I haven't killed the mom.

895
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,810
But the mom just disappeared.

896
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,210
So I don't know where the fuck she goes.

897
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,250
Also, thank you so much for the follow links.

898
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,170
I do appreciate it.

899
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,730
Thank you, thank you.

900
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,490
Alright, mom.

901
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,130
Give me that sandwich.

902
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,130
So I can feed the rat.

903
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,070
So I can feed the rat again.

904
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,240
It worked with the... also thank you so much for the follow links.

905
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,440
It worked with the...

906
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,760
It worked last time.

907
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,380
I just don't know why it's not working now.

908
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,320
The rat for some reason doesn't want to eat my sandwiches for some reason.

909
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,140
I don't know why.

910
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,060
I think my sandwiches are perfectly good.

911
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,200
Alright, bye.

912
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,820
Alright, here.

913
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,000
Here's the rat.

914
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,900
Here it is.

915
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,100
Here it is.

916
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,400
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

917
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:50,640
Okay.

918
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,960
Oh my god, I got a shadow man.

919
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,480
Please!

920
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,180
Shadow man!

921
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,780
Please, I just got it to work.

922
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,640
Shadow man, please!

923
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,180
Well,

924
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,980
I don't care about you.

925
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,580
I was gonna be so angry.

926
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,660
I worked so... Shadow man, please!

927
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,200
Please, I just got this.

928
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,860
Please, I just got this.

929
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:18,860
Please.

930
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,340
I just...

931
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,560
Alright, anyway.

932
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,100
Anyway.

933
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,080
And then, what do we do here?

934
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,680
Alright, and then I do like put it here somewhere.

935
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,080
Oh, she's... oh.

936
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Is she okay?

937
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,680
Wake up, mom!

938
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,260
Mom!

939
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,160
Oh!

940
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,760
Oh, bye mom!

941
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,860
Oh!

942
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,280
So that's where mom...

943
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,120
Oh, okay.

944
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,580
How do I... How do I do this?

945
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,000
Okay, so that's where mom went.

946
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,020
How do I get rid of this?

947
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,940
How do I do this?

948
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,420
Please!

949
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,700
Oh, shadow man.

950
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,600
Shadow man!

951
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,500
Shadow man!

952
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,420
Shadow man!

953
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,120
Please!

954
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,340
Shadow man!

955
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,740
Shadow man, please!

956
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,040
I just want to get... Oh, hey, I did it.

957
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:19,920
Okay.

958
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,700
Ani, thank you so...

959
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,660
Is that it?

960
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,500
What do I do?

961
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,980
What do I do now?

962
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,120
Thank you so much for the little sub.

963
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,220
I do appreciate it.

964
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,860
What do I do?

965
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,560
Daddy's home.

966
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,380
Hey, daddy.

967
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,940
Okay, there's a bear trap.

968
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,580
Yeah!

969
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,140
Dumbass.

970
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:47,820
Oh!

971
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,460
Oh, I'm the dumbass!

972
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,580
I'm the dumbass!

973
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,280
Wait!

974
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,520
Oh, no!

975
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,520
Oh, no!

976
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,420
Oh, no!

977
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,040
Oh, no!

978
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,380
Oh, no!

979
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:57,940
Oh, no!

980
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,340
Ahahaha!

981
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,560
Ahhh.

982
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,940
You're gonna get the taste of Apollo.

983
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,880
Dumbass.

984
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,720
Ahhh.

985
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,660
Ahhhh.

986
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,040
I'm so sad.

987
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,540
I'm so sad.

988
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,540
I can't believe.

989
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,780
I thought I got it.

990
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,960
I thought I was like 800 IQing this shit.

991
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,300
I thought I was so smart.

992
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,580
I thought I was so smart.

993
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,520
How do I do this?

994
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,360
I didn't appreciate you bear trapping this boy.

995
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,160
I was like haha he's dead.

996
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,680
So mom gets eaten by a fridge and dad is a face eating floor of the mat.

997
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,880
This family's got it all.

998
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,360
Thank you so much for the follow, Pastel.

999
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,140
I do appreciate it.

1000
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,400
Thank you.

1001
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:21,880
Alright, cat.

1002
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,600
Eat your milk.

1003
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,240
Get the fuck.

1004
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,340
Dude, I hate how this takes 20 years.

1005
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,860
It takes him 20 years to get his milk.

1006
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,560
Get his cat ass off.

1007
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,760
The cat's the only one I can save.

1008
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,180
I can't even tell this is a horror game where a main main will never win game.

1009
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,060
I'm never gonna win.

1010
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,540
It's simpler than man get caught in a bear trap.

1011
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,600
Okay.

1012
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,060
Well...

1013
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,260
It still goes to P.K.S.E.

1014
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,320
Learn something new every time so as long as you keep learning, experiment, I see that's progress.

1015
00:40:59,480 --> 00:40:59,780
Exactly.

1016
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,140
Exactly.

1017
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:06,020
The only thing is that our sister doesn't live but that's okay.

1018
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,260
I've always wanted to be an only child.

1019
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,540
I've always wanted to be an only child.

1020
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,120
That's okay.

1021
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,640
Like, I tried to do something about it but look.

1022
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Doesn't let me do anything.

1023
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,120
I can't save him so it's fine.

1024
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,740
I don't need her.

1025
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,400
What does she even do for my house?

1026
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:26,880
Nothing.

1027
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,860
Like, what?

1028
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,560
Do I kill the frog?

1029
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,200
I also learned that you can kill the frogs but it doesn't do shit.

1030
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,640
Like, it just comes back.

1031
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,480
Oh, thank you so much for the follow, Kenny.

1032
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,460
I do appreciate it.

1033
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:37,800
Thank you.

1034
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,840
What do I need?

1035
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,740
Oh, I need sandwiches.

1036
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,160
Yes.

1037
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,700
You're doing great, sweetie.

1038
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,440
I'm trying my best.

1039
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,080
Drop me the bullet bomb.

1040
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,820
Cat.

1041
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,440
Lord, wait.

1042
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:48,860
It's a cat.

1043
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,180
Faster?

1044
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,040
I don't think so.

1045
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,220
I tried dropping it before.

1046
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,300
You only won once.

1047
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:54,780
Happy birthday, sweetie.

1048
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,920
Today is my birthday.

1049
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,520
Happy birthday, Snake.

1050
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,500
Can we get some happy birthdays and chat for Snake real quick?

1051
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,780
Here's some happy birthdays.

1052
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,520
Oh, Shadow Man.

1053
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,700
Hey, Shadow Man.

1054
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,520
Okay.

1055
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,960
Alright, I have the sandwich.

1056
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,160
Alright.

1057
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,980
Rat, rat, rat, rat, rat, rat, rat, rat.

1058
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,240
Here.

1059
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,920
Here's your dumbass sandwich.

1060
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,300
Here.

1061
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,740
Rat.

1062
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,280
Rat!

1063
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,000
Rat!

1064
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,140
No!

1065
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:22,760
No!

1066
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,400
Shadow Man.

1067
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,140
Shadow Man.

1068
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,260
Alright, now we gotta... we don't care about you.

1069
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:30,920
Bye.

1070
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,460
And then we gotta get the... we gotta get the... oh shit.

1071
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:34,880
Wait, wait, wait.

1072
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,680
We gotta do this.

1073
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,000
We gotta...

1074
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,100
Alright, and then we gotta go get the axe.

1075
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,840
Yeah, but I could always come back in.

1076
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,020
I could always come back...

1077
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,820
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1078
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,640
Okay, there you go.

1079
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:50,920
We're fine.

1080
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:51,900
We're fine.

1081
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,000
We don't care about the sister.

1082
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,120
Okay, wait a minute.

1083
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,660
I can save my... I think I can save my mom here.

1084
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,280
I can save my mom.

1085
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,840
I can save my mom.

1086
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,780
Don't worry, mom.

1087
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,020
Don't worry, mom.

1088
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,840
I'll chop her head.

1089
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,840
Mom, I'll save you too.

1090
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,900
Mom, look at this.

1091
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,220
Watch this, mom.

1092
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,060
Look at this.

1093
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,140
I got this.

1094
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,580
Yeah, yeah.

1095
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:17,500
Yeah!

1096
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,220
You're welcome.

1097
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,500
You don't give a fuck.

1098
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,660
Oh shit, Shadow Man.

1099
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,720
I did it!

1100
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,360
I saved mom!

1101
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,300
Okay, alright, alright.

1102
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,320
I did it.

1103
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,220
Oh, oh!

1104
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,230
Okay, okay, okay.

1105
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,210
There we go.

1106
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,550
I'm so good at this game.

1107
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,150
What do I do now?

1108
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,550
Okay, what do I do now though?

1109
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:55,670
What do I do now?

1110
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,310
I don't know what to do!

1111
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:58,330
Mom!

1112
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,490
Alright, alright, okay, okay.

1113
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,030
I got this.

1114
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,330
Alright, dad's gonna be here.

1115
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:05,530
Daddy's home.

1116
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,830
Yeah, get in here.

1117
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:07,670
Get in here.

1118
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,990
Stupid.

1119
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,450
Yeah, that's right.

1120
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:10,690
Bye.

1121
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:11,790
Whoa, dad!

1122
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:12,690
I got mom!

1123
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:13,670
Don't worry, I have mom!

1124
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,370
I have mom!

1125
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,110
What are you gonna do?

1126
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:18,770
Mom!

1127
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,330
I saved your life!

1128
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,930
I saved your life!

1129
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,870
I saved your life!

1130
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,190
I saved your life!

1131
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,070
I saved your life!

1132
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:30,250
I saved your life!

1133
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,390
What the fuck's the point of saving mom?

1134
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:39,430
What the fuck was the point?

1135
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,270
What the fuck was the point of saving mom?

1136
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,930
She's not gonna do shit!

1137
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,230
I'm so sad.

1138
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,770
I'm so sad.

1139
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,270
Alright, so mom can die.

1140
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,290
At least I learned mom can die.

1141
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,530
Mom can die.

1142
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,950
We don't need to give a fuck about her.

1143
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,610
We don't need to give a fuck about mom.

1144
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,150
All those efforts wasted on her.

1145
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,590
What's the point?

1146
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,610
All she's good for is making sandwiches.

1147
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,130
Cat!

1148
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,810
Oh, it does wake him up!

1149
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,310
Roy, you were right!

1150
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,710
I'm sorry for doubting you!

1151
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,630
Okay.

1152
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,310
Alright, so I woke up cat.

1153
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,770
Alright, get your fat ass off.

1154
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:29,890
Alright.

1155
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,250
Okay, and then I need, I need key.

1156
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:33,910
I need key.

1157
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,170
Alright, and then, and then I need to unlock key.

1158
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,490
And then I need to pick this up.

1159
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,550
And then I need to, what the fuck do I need to do?

1160
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:51,090
Um, oh yeah, I need to cycle this and drop it here.

1161
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:51,930
Alright.

1162
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,830
Can I make the doll in the rat room?

1163
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,250
Oh shit, yeah, I should try that.

1164
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,950
It doesn't even make me become half the man he used.

1165
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:01,650
Can I?

1166
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,570
No, nothing drops there.

1167
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,650
What if I do this to my mom?

1168
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,210
What happens?

1169
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:08,030
Mom.

1170
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:08,490
Oh.

1171
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,110
Okay.

1172
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,370
Alright, mom doesn't give a fuck, apparently.

1173
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,830
Mom doesn't care.

1174
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,110
Alright.

1175
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,390
Give me the bear trap.

1176
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:16,930
Give it to me.

1177
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:17,710
Alright.

1178
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,370
What the fuck do I do with this?

1179
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,440
Okay, and then I need to wait until...

1180
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,280
What do I do here?

1181
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:32,920
Oh, I just wait.

1182
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,840
I just need sandwiches.

1183
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,240
I just need, I just need the sandwiches.

1184
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,500
I don't give a fuck about light switches.

1185
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,920
Oh, it's spooky now.

1186
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,760
Oh, it's spooky.

1187
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,140
Oh, what are you gonna do?

1188
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,900
What if I turn off the lights here?

1189
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,080
Sister, are you gonna keep playing in the dark?

1190
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,780
Don't be dumb.

1191
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,780
Don't play in the dark.

1192
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,140
Sister!

1193
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,640
Is this annoying?

1194
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,120
Sister!

1195
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:57,920
Is this annoying?

1196
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,040
This is annoying?

1197
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,420
Sister!

1198
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:00,640
Sister!

1199
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,280
Sister!

1200
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,360
Okay, she doesn't give a shit.

1201
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,440
Well, I don't know.

1202
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,340
I've given up.

1203
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,340
I just need...

1204
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,760
We don't need her.

1205
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,840
We don't need her, guys.

1206
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,820
All we need is our cat.

1207
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,180
All we need is our fucking cat.

1208
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,340
We don't need anyone else.

1209
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,240
Apparently, this is due shit.

1210
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,280
Anyway.

1211
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,140
And then... sandwich.

1212
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,160
Here.

1213
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:41,900
Eat the sandwich.

1214
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,260
Eat the sandwich.

1215
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,180
Yeah, that's right, bitch.

1216
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:44,560
Okay.

1217
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,380
I'm sorry for calling you a bitch.

1218
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:47,700
I'm sorry.

1219
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm sorry.

1220
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,340
I'm sorry.

1221
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,980
I'm sorry.

1222
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:49,560
I'm sorry.

1223
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:49,840
Okay.

1224
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,180
Okay.

1225
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:50,860
Yeah, bitch.

1226
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,560
I don't know what to do after this.

1227
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,080
All right.

1228
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,520
You know what?

1229
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,420
I'll save the mom.

1230
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,080
I have nothing else to do right now.

1231
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,460
Mom, you're lucky.

1232
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,540
I have nothing else to do.

1233
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,340
Oh, she's asleep.

1234
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,700
Mom, you're lucky.

1235
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,480
I have nothing else to do right now.

1236
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,440
What do I do?

1237
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,220
Can I just kill her?

1238
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,400
Whoa!

1239
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,280
Whoa!

1240
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,160
Well then.

1241
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:17,580
Okay.

1242
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,000
Bye.

1243
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,940
You know what?

1244
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,580
Oh!

1245
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,280
Oh, I forgot the

1246
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:35,760
cat!

1247
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,060
Oh!

1248
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,180
Oh, no!

1249
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,820
I forgot

1250
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,250
the cat!

1251
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,190
I'm so sorry!

1252
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:53,810
Oh!

1253
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,350
I killed the cat and the mom!

1254
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,930
Look, I just need... I need this to fucking hurry up.

1255
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,050
Look, it's not my fault.

1256
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,850
Shadow Man, I don't have time for your shit.

1257
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,930
I don't...

1258
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,290
Okay, there we go.

1259
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:12,850
All right.

1260
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,550
I need to swing my hammer.

1261
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,060
Do this?

1262
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:23,620
What?

1263
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,030
I just wanted to open the closet.

1264
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:30,530
I just wanted to...

1265
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,910
Girl, thank you so much for the raid!

1266
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:35,770
Thank you!

1267
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:36,670
I got worried again.

1268
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:37,510
Well...

1269
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,950
We don't need the mom.

1270
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:41,850
We don't need the...

1271
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,810
We've learned that we don't need the mom.

1272
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,770
We don't need the sister.

1273
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:48,170
We might need the cat, but I forgot about the cat there.

1274
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:54,370
I keep forgetting.

1275
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,070
How do I do this shit?

1276
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:58,750
All right.

1277
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,030
So we don't need a lot of people.

1278
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:00,910
We just need the cat.

1279
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,490
We just need the cat.

1280
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:05,930
I hope you had a good stream, Crow.

1281
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:06,850
I hope you had a good stream.

1282
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:07,830
All right.

1283
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:08,330
All right.

1284
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:09,430
Don't worry.

1285
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:10,450
Bam.

1286
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:11,270
Yeah, that's right.

1287
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,150
Wake the fuck up, cat.

1288
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:16,250
We don't need... Yeah, we don't need anyone other than the cat and the rat.

1289
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,500
What do you mean back?

1290
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:22,940
I did!

1291
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,980
I hugged the back wall and then she bored me!

1292
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,760
She bored me!

1293
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,580
Did you not see the board?

1294
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,590
I was at the back.

1295
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,590
This is the back.

1296
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,290
I was over here.

1297
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,550
I was... I was right here.

1298
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,590
And then she bored me.

1299
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,980
With the cat and the rat.

1300
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,960
It's gonna be some interesting PDA meetings.

1301
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,580
What am I doing?

1302
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,400
Oh shit.

1303
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:50,600
Wait.

1304
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:50,860
Okay.

1305
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:51,900
Boom.

1306
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,960
Oh, that's not it.

1307
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:53,580
Boom.

1308
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,160
There we go.

1309
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,800
These are the followers.

1310
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,920
I do appreciate it.

1311
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,260
Thank you.

1312
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:57,600
Thank you.

1313
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,140
Hmm.

1314
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:01,880
No, no, no.

1315
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,720
You put the sandwiches.

1316
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,640
You put the sandwiches on the rat.

1317
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,580
Is he gonna establish his sister to do anything?

1318
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,740
Do we care about the sister though?

1319
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:12,860
I don't...

1320
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,740
I don't... We don't care about the sister though.

1321
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,580
Like, I'm not gonna do shit about her.

1322
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,820
I'm not gonna save her life.

1323
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,940
You know... Oh, hey.

1324
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1325
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,940
I wanna kill the frog.

1326
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,820
I don't know what it does, but I just wanna kill the frog.

1327
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,500
Oh, wait.

1328
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,200
That's not it.

1329
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,740
Oh, wait.

1330
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,340
That's not it.

1331
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,480
I don't understand.

1332
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,960
Spatial... Spatial... Wait.

1333
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,380
Spatial... Wait, can I...

1334
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,600
Why can't I pick it up?

1335
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,780
Oh, the frog has the bowling ball now.

1336
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,340
Well then.

1337
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,060
I guess the frog has the bowling ball now.

1338
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,920
And then I'll hit you down here.

1339
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:53,520
Alright.

1340
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,240
Alright.

1341
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,060
I need my sandwiches.

1342
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,580
Now is the time to deconfirm.

1343
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,040
I can't... I can't pick up the bowling ball anymore.

1344
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,680
I don't think they want me to crush the frog.

1345
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,520
I don't think they like that.

1346
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:09,940
Now I can save the mom.

1347
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,560
Well, I don't really care about the mom.

1348
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:14,940
To be honest.

1349
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,560
So all we're gonna do is...

1350
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,080
Kill every kind of scary, to be honest.

1351
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,180
No, no, no, no, no.

1352
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:21,920
This is all planned.

1353
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,380
Like... I didn't kill anyone.

1354
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,140
She's just dumb.

1355
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,520
She's just dumb.

1356
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,000
To be fair, I didn't kill anyone.

1357
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,060
She's just stupid.

1358
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:36,740
Okay.

1359
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,020
Alright.

1360
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,340
I need to save the cat.

1361
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,720
I just need to save the cat.

1362
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,480
I just need to save the cat.

1363
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:42,760
Okay.

1364
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:42,960
Alright.

1365
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:43,660
I saved the cat.

1366
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,260
I did it.

1367
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:44,900
Alright.

1368
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,140
Alright.

1369
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,380
Alright.

1370
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,240
And then...

1371
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,200
I guess I can save mom too.

1372
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,340
I guess... I guess I can save the mom too.

1373
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:52,720
Bye.

1374
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:57,960
No.

1375
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,940
She doesn't go in.

1376
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,680
She doesn't...

1377
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,280
I poured water on her and then she freaked out and died.

1378
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,240
And...

1379
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,320
I'll save the mom once.

1380
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,080
Okay?

1381
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:09,980
I'll save her again.

1382
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:15,930
Please come out.

1383
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,370
Please come out.

1384
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:19,450
Oh,

1385
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,420
there you are.

1386
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:26,820
Yeah.

1387
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,460
Yeah.

1388
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:27,920
Yeah!

1389
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,400
Stupid.

1390
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,140
Alright.

1391
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,040
And then we gotta...

1392
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,280
And then we gotta do this thing.

1393
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,380
Alright.

1394
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,160
I'm just gonna wait until this works.

1395
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:43,280
Alright.

1396
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:43,280
I'm just gonna wait until this works.

1397
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,540
Can you pick up... No.

1398
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,120
I tried picking up the sandwich.

1399
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,340
But I can only pick up one.

1400
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,240
I have no idea.

1401
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,260
We don't care about the mom.

1402
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,960
She does nothing for me.

1403
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,360
I... I... I like led dad over.

1404
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,320
And then dad... he was just like...

1405
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:00,600
Bye.

1406
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:08,790
Look at this.

1407
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,630
You liar!

1408
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:10,330
You liar!

1409
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,190
Roy, you fucking liar!

1410
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:17,850
Oh, hey.

1411
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:18,750
Daddy's home too.

1412
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:19,690
Oh, hey.

1413
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:20,110
Look at that.

1414
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,470
He's...

1415
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,990
Oh.

1416
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:24,670
Hey, look.

1417
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,250
Daddy's home.

1418
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,120
Yo.

1419
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,860
Thanks, dad.

1420
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,360
Yeah.

1421
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,580
Thank goodness he's here.

1422
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,060
Thank goodness he's here.

1423
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,940
Thank goodness he's here.

1424
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,140
Thank goodness he's here.

1425
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,200
Never trust Roy.

1426
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,320
Oh, he's home with both our sadness.

1427
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,580
Now I... Hey, look.

1428
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,960
It's okay.

1429
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:55,900
Mom's still alive.

1430
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,220
I saved mom.

1431
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,980
That's all that matters, right?

1432
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,320
I fucking saved that bitch.

1433
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,100
Alright.

1434
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,460
Please.

1435
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:10,920
Please.

1436
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,660
Get the fuck away.

1437
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,060
Alright.

1438
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,400
Okay.

1439
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,420
And then...

1440
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,360
Okay.

1441
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,040
And then...

1442
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:20,900
Wait.

1443
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,500
How do I...

1444
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,320
Key...

1445
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,300
Okay.

1446
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,000
And then pick up.

1447
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,040
And then...

1448
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:27,640
And then what do I do?

1449
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,040
Oh, yeah.

1450
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,260
Okay.

1451
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:28,480
Okay.

1452
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:28,620
Okay.

1453
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,500
I gotta...

1454
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,480
I just wanna...

1455
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,820
Let me win this game.

1456
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,140
Please.

1457
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,520
I don't care people...

1458
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,740
I don't care that people are dead.

1459
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,180
I... I don't care that I've killed...

1460
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,740
I've killed many people.

1461
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,660
I... I can't.

1462
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,720
I have to wait for the sandwiches.

1463
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,260
Um...

1464
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,380
I have to wait for the sandwiches for the rat.

1465
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,020
And then...

1466
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:49,660
Alright.

1467
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,320
How do we distract the lady from the bathroom?

1468
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,080
I don't know.

1469
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,640
I don't know what to do about that.

1470
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,980
I need...

1471
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,320
Okay.

1472
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,080
So...

1473
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,280
So I don't know what to do here.

1474
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,000
I'm stuck here.

1475
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,500
This is where I'm stuck at, guys.

1476
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,440
This is the...

1477
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,040
Well, maybe if I...

1478
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,860
Do I... If I go to my sister's room...

1479
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,500
Sister...

1480
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,100
Hey, sister.

1481
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,060
Yes, I know you hate your life.

1482
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,280
Like...

1483
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,240
There's nothing I can do here, though, in her room.

1484
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,440
Yeah, her room is meaningless.

1485
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,900
I have to...

1486
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,660
I have to get the sandwiches, though.

1487
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,720
I don't have the sandwiches.

1488
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,700
How does this face do?

1489
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,360
I have no idea.

1490
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,900
I can't...

1491
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,500
I can't...

1492
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:43,940
Um...

1493
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,020
I can't go in the room without my sandwiches because of the rat.

1494
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,980
I need the sandwiches so the rat will be satisfied and won't eat me.

1495
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,620
And it grows.

1496
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,400
I made sandwiches.

1497
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,080
Oh, I made sandwiches.

1498
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,680
And then...

1499
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,020
Okay.

1500
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:02,400
So...

1501
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:02,660
Okay.

1502
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,420
I'll show you guys what I did last time because we don't give a fuck about the...

1503
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,800
We don't really give a fuck.

1504
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:07,740
Actually, no.

1505
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,160
Actually, no.

1506
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:08,440
I'm not.

1507
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,740
I want to save the cat.

1508
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,180
I want to save the cat.

1509
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,940
So I want...

1510
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,960
I actually sort of want to save the cat.

1511
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:14,540
So...

1512
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,400
Here.

1513
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,400
Take this.

1514
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:18,560
I'm going to...

1515
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:21,860
I'm going to give this to Elisar.

1516
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,040
Thank you so much for the gift!

1517
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:23,940
This is Elisar!

1518
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,580
Can I get some bark knives real quick?

1519
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,060
Can I get some bark knives real quick for...

1520
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,100
For Elisar?

1521
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:30,420
Okay.

1522
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,260
And then we put this...

1523
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:31,540
Woo!

1524
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,160
Bye there!

1525
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:32,800
Okay.

1526
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,400
And then we don't give a fuck about the mom.

1527
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,420
We don't give a fuck about...

1528
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:36,940
And use your spring.

1529
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,880
You can grab the axe, just put it on the rack and get you and cut the...

1530
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,060
Cut the boards?

1531
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,400
Well...

1532
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,300
That...

1533
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,080
I don't give a fuck.

1534
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,140
I don't give a fuck.

1535
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:46,160
I don't give a fuck.

1536
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,960
I don't give a fuck.

1537
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,180
I don't give a fuck.

1538
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,660
Maybe if I leave the dad, if I leave the dad to crazy lady.

1539
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,740
Then maybe she'll war him instead of me.

1540
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:56,820
Right?

1541
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,440
Maybe she'll war him.

1542
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,560
Oh I forgot the cat again!

1543
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,800
I forgot the cat again!

1544
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,460
I'm sorry!

1545
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,560
I forgot the cat again!

1546
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,660
I'm so sorry.

1547
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:15,940
Oh!

1548
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,700
What the fuck!

1549
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,790
Oh he did not like that.

1550
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,030
He didn't like that I forgot the cat.

1551
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,470
Oh he was not happy about that.

1552
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,890
He was not happy about that.

1553
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,510
He's our only family.

1554
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,110
I told you this was...

1555
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:50,990
You would think that.

1556
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,830
You would think that.

1557
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,730
This was supposed to be a 30 minute game.

1558
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,190
It was a fucking lie.

1559
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:58,910
Angry.

1560
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:00,830
Shadowman was not happy.

1561
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:03,350
He was not happy about that.

1562
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:07,610
Okay.

1563
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,480
Alright.

1564
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:13,900
Okay.

1565
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:14,180
Okay.

1566
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:14,380
Okay.

1567
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:14,760
Alright.

1568
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,820
If I do this.

1569
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:16,480
Boom.

1570
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,340
And then I'll get the axe first.

1571
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:18,700
Right?

1572
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,640
You guys want me to try getting the axe first.

1573
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,020
Right?

1574
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:21,460
Okay.

1575
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:21,980
Let's try.

1576
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,740
Let's try this.

1577
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,500
Just don't use my sprint.

1578
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,100
I just don't use my sprint.

1579
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,600
I just don't use my sprint.

1580
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,880
I just don't use my sprint.

1581
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:33,460
You liar!

1582
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:37,760

Me and time.

1587
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,650
Me and time.

1588
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:01,690

1592
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,470
I don't care how many people.

1593
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,570
It's hard.

1594
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:23,770
Oh my God.

1595
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:28,250
I don't care how many people die in this world.

01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:30,310
I just want to win.

1597
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,070
I just want this game to be over.

1598
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,130
I need to sleep right at work tomorrow.

1599
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:43,190
I'll watch the VOD and see how cute I get to the game.

1600
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,550
Alright, thanks for the rating.

1601

Alright.

1605
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:57,610
But it's what you have to do it.

1606
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:58,810
I have to do that?

1607
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:00,210

1608
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:01,790

1611
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:11,610
Okay, I'll do it again.

01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,010
No, actually no.

1613
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:13,570
I don't give a fuck.

01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,290

1621
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:34,170
Stupid rat, stupid rat, stupid rat.

1622
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:34,730
Yeah, bitch.

1623
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:38,930
Stupid rat.

1624
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,050
Alright, alright.

1625
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,310
Oh, and then I can like... I know.

01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:45,970
Oh, I see, I see.

1627
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:48,510

1628
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:50,710
Um... Oh, I know.

1629
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:52,550
I know, I know.

1630
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:53,030
I got this.

1631
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:53,450
My brain.

1632
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,870
My brain is getting bigger.

1633
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,230
My brain is getting bigger.

1634
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:58,130
I know what to do.

1635
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:58,730
I know what to do.

1636
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,270
Yeah, okay, and then I pick this up.

1637
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:01,630
And then...

1638
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,530
Oh, but then I'm gonna save the sister.

1639
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,710
Then I'm gonna save the sister.

1640
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:09,810
We don't give a fuck about the sister.

1641
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:11,450
Alright, sister.

1642
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:12,990
Here's your stupid sandwich.

1643
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:15,770
Sister!

1644
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:17,090
I got you a sandwich!

1645
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,870
Is she gonna die?

1646
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:20,810
No!

1647
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:23,830
Well then.

1648
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:26,290
I got your sandwich, sister.

1649
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,160
Well...

1650
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,000
It appears that... oh...

1651
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,700
It appears that it didn't work.

1652
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:40,960
Guys.

1653
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:45,500
It appears that the sandwich did not want a night limit.

1654
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,100
That wasn't it.

1655
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,520
That... well then.

1656
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,120
Sandwich...

1657
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,040
does not save the sister.

1658
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,200
Well, I've learned.

1659
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,440
I've learned that... How do I win this?

1660
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,340
How do I fucking win this?

1661
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,120
Please!

1662
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,320
Someone backseat!

1663
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,340
Please backseat this game for me!

1664
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,240
I hate backseat gamers!

1665
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,380
This is just pain.

1666
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,480
This is just pain at this point.

1667
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,100
All I feel is pain.

1668
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,900
I swear, okay.

1669
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:50,140
If we don't figure out a solution by the 15 minute mark, we're fucking done with it.

1670
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,120
We're fucking folding up a tutorial.

1671
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,420
We've been stuck on this one area.

1672
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:00,980
I have a doll?

1673
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,980
Oh wait, I should save my mom first.

1674
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:06,600
I should...

1675
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,220
But I don't want to save... okay, but the thing is, I don't need to save my sister.

1676
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,160
My sister's optional.

1677
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,660
Like, we don't need her.

1678
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,060
There's no reason to have her in our lives.

1679
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,580
Oh shit, I need the bowling ball.

1680
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,300
We don't need the sister in our lives, so that's just an optional thing.

1681
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,180
I want to be an only child.

1682
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,010
Just kill her with a bear trap, part of a sub, but then what about dad?

1683
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,890
What about dad?

1684
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:44,490
No.

1685
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:45,230
Whoa!

1686
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,050
Will you hold me okay?

1687
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:51,510
Bye!

1688
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,090
My sister.

1689
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,770
Oh, she doesn't want you.

1690
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,260
Yeah, that guy's new.

1691
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:17,680
Yeah.

1692
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,640
Wait, what if I put her in the room?

1693
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,380
I'll put her in here.

1694
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,000
I'll just drop her here.

1695
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,960
Will you hold me?

1696
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:28,440
Yeah.

1697
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,220
Bye.

1698
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,660
Alright, now she's just gonna play the song?

1699
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,960
What is the doll gonna do?

1700
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,400
Wait, I put the...

1701
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,320
Okay, so she doesn't give a fuck, so I'm just gonna leave.

1702
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,580
Oh, would war lady like her?

1703
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:54,960
What are you here?

1704
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,140
Oh wait, I need the sand- okay.

1705
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,920
I don't know what to do now.

1706
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,240
I got this down.

1707
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:07,600
Okay.

1708
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,100
And then I need sandwich.

1709
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,440
Alright, we don't care about sister.

1710
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,940
We don't care about...

1711
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,400
Am I redeemable?

1712
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:20,740
Exactly!

1713
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:21,660
We don't need her!

1714
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:22,980
Boom.

1715
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,320
Eat your sandwich, stupid.

1716
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,280
Here we go.

1717
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:26,840
Alright.

1718
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,060
Now rat's happy.

1719
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:28,820
Whoa!

1720
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,360
Whoa!

1721
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,220
I'm not happy!

1722
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:37,260
Alright, and then we gotta do this thingy.

1723
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,810
Whoa, but wait, I need to drop this thingy.

1724
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:47,450
Okay, so we settle on how to deal with dad first round.

1725
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:50,110
How the fuck do I deal with dad second round?

1726
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:55,070
Well, I don't know how to deal with dad second round.

1727
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:56,510
So...

1728
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:58,530
The cat!

1729
01:06:58,650 --> 01:06:58,930
The cat!

1730
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,130
The cat!

1731
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:03,210
The cat!

1732
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:03,230
Oh!

1733
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:07,790
Alright, here, I'll hold you.

1734
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,510
What the fuck do I do with you?

1735
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,730
Alright, I drop you?

1736
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:12,370
Here you go.

1737
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:14,870
Alright, alright.

1738
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:17,790
Okay, so all we have is just wait until midnight now.

1739
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:24,210
Oh, Shadow Man!

1740
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,050
Oh, Shadow Man!

1741
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:25,170
I need you.

1742
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,370
Oh, oh.

1743
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:27,310
Do I save mom?

1744
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:28,070
Do I save mom?

1745
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:28,670
Pop!

1746
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:30,590
I might as well.

1747
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:30,970
I'm here.

1748
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,770
Alright, and then I turn on the lights.

1749
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,670
And then... Now what do I do?

1750
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,850
I don't know what to do now.

1751
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:38,950
I guess I wait?

1752
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,000
Okay.

1753
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:48,530
Dad!

1754
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,490
I did everything I could!

1755
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:52,630
Oh, Shadow Man!

1756
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:54,430
Dad!

1757
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:56,070
Dad!

1758
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:57,230
Oh...

1759
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:58,970
Doll fell down.

1760
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,250
Why did doll fell down?

1761
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:05,950
Why did doll fall down?

1762
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:09,010
I just want one ending, user.

1763
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,450
I just want one ending.

1764
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,030
Alright, daddy.

1765
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:14,030
Alright, dad.

1766
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:16,510
Now I'm waiting.

1767
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:17,930
Daddy's home.

1768
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:18,510
Alright, dad.

1769
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:19,470
Just go into this trap.

1770
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:20,350
Go into this trap.

1771
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:22,330
Woop!

1772
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:22,810
My mom!

1773
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:26,820
Hey, dad!

1774
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:27,320
I'm right here!

1775
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,320
Woop!

1776
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,120
Woop!

1777
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,160
What

1778
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,550
the fuck was that?

1779
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,010
I'm so sorry.

1780
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,670
Thank you so much for the gift.

1781
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:50,810
It's so to Acer.

1782
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:54,850
Thank you for the birthday.

1783
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:57,270
Real quick.

1784
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,010
XA, thank you so much for the follow.

1785
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:04,010
Thank you so much for the follow.

1786
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:05,210
I really appreciate it.

1787
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:06,290
Alright.

1788
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:07,710
You know what?

1789
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:10,550
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do.

1790
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:15,970
I can destroy the toilet in the bathroom.

1791
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:18,070
Alright, let's destroy the fucking toilet with the bowling ball.

1792
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,870
I was like, here, thank you so much for the follow.

1793
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:20,570
Thank you, thank you.

1794
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,390
I really do appreciate it.

1795
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,710
Well, the doll was fucking useless.

1796
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,790
We don't give a shit about the doll.

1797
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,450
So she was useless.

1798
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,170
Go into war?

1799
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:33,170
But I can't make it into... I can't though.

1800
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:33,470
Look.

1801
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,830
It won't let me go in.

1802
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:36,030
It's locked.

1803
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:38,710
Mom won't let me in.

1804
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,200
But it's so hard.

1805
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,560
The rat's too fast for me.

1806
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,520
The rat's too fast.

1807
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,040
Okay, I'll show you guys.

1808
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:55,840
I'll show you guys.

1809
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,000
Look at this.

1810
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,020
The rat's too good.

1811
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,220
Look.

1812
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:03,680
Alright.

1813
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,380
Wait!

1814
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,200
Oh, I'm a pro gamer!

1815
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,640
I'm a fucking pro gamer!

1816
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,020
Wait, wait a minute.

1817
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,520
I'm a fucking pro gamer.

1818
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:13,740
I'm a fucking pro gamer.

1819
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,580
Oh shit!

1820
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,200
Yeah!

1821
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,120
I did it!

1822
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,740
I'm so good!

1823
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,860
Wait, do I need to see?

1824
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,960
Oh, we don't give a fuck about mom anyway.

1825
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,060
Wait, how do I go in?

1826
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,640
Oh, I need the bowling ball.

1827
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,420
I need the bowling ball.

1828
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,240
I fucked up!

1829
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,700
I didn't bring the bowling ball!

1830
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,220
I fucked up.

1831
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,320
I forgot the bowling ball.

1832
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,100
I forgot the most important part.

1833
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,020
Dude, I'm so fucking good.

1834
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,080
I'm so good at this game!

1835
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:45,600
Bam!

1836
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,820
Who the fuck are you?

1837
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:55,590
What do I do?

1838
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:55,970
What do I do?

1839
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:56,110
Do I...

1840
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:59,210
What do I do?

1841
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,950
I can't pick it up!

1842
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:03,410
It won't let me...

1843
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:04,930
What the fuck.

1844
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,530
We don't give a shit.

1845
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:07,950
Well, I guess... I guess he's dead.

1846
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:11,390
Um,

1847
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,250
I guess my mom's dead too.

1848
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:18,830
I guess my mom's dead.

1849
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:21,750
I

1850
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,880
don't know what else to do anymore.

1851
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,980
Oh, the shot!

1852
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:41,840
The shotgun!

1853
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:45,020
I forgot the shotgun in the closet!

1854
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:46,820
You know, I might as well get bored.

1855
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,460
Just bore me.

1856
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:55,050
Alright, just like...

1857
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,050
I need the shotgun.

1858
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:58,950
No, no, no.

1859
01:11:58,970 --> 01:11:59,450
Okay, okay.

1860
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:00,950
Alright, alright, alright.

1861
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,390
Alright, we got this.

1862
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:02,910
We got this.

1863
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:06,090
I got this.

1864
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,190
I know what to do now.

1865
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:08,370
My brain has expanded.

1866
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,210
My brain has expanded.

1867
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,930
I don't care about who else dies here.

1868
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:12,870
I'm just...

1869
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,010
I'm just accepting them for.

1870
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,910
Yeah, but what do I need the lights on for?

1871
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:24,790
Like, what do I need the lights on for though?

1872
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:28,550
There's no reason to have lights on.

1873
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,630
My brain has expanded today, guys.

1874
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:33,890
Alright, watch this.

1875
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:35,410
Watch this pro gamer.

1876
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,230
Yeah, you thought...

1877
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,870
You thought... I know how to play this game now.

1878
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,830
You thought you got this?

1879
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:47,970
I'm better.

1880
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:49,850
I'm a better gamer.

1881
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:50,850
Get the fuck away, mom.

1882
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:51,850
Yeah.

1883
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:52,570
Yeah, mom.

1884
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:56,910
Yeah, get out.

1885
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,150
Get out, mom.

1886
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:01,730
Alright, and then I take the shotgun.

1887
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:06,690
Alright, and then...

1888
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,770
And then... bam.

1889
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:10,670
Give me that.

1890
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,370
And then...

1891
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,250
I go...

1892
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:15,350
Oh!

1893
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:17,610
Well, I don't give a fuck about the sister.

1894
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,410
I don't care about her.

1895
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:21,950
Um, okay, so...

1896
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:25,230
First off, I need the bowling ball for the bear trap.

1897
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:26,310
Alright, I got all the...

1898
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,190
Okay, okay, we don't care about the sister.

1899
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:29,870
Like, I wanna be an only child.

1900
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,030
Should I save mom?

1901
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:34,810
Oh, I should save the cat though.

1902
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:36,530
Alright, I'm gonna save the cat.

1903
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:41,210
Break your toilet after getting the trap?

1904
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:41,470
Why?

1905
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,370
Well, this is...

1906
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,890
What does the toilet do?

1907
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:49,010
Yeah, but I don't care about the sister.

1908
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:51,430
That doesn't do shit though, right?

1909
01:13:58,050 --> 01:13:58,890
What is this?

1910
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:05,570
Hey, ducky.

1911
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:07,630
Why would I do it with a ducky?

1912
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,900
Okay, I need this.

1913
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,340
Alright, alright.

1914
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,160
Okay, so we got everything we need.

1915
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:20,460
Alright.

1916
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,740
And then...

1917
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,860
We need the bear trap here.

1918
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,060
Okay, and then...

1919
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,040
And I guess I can watch my sister die.

1920
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,380
The fucking timing on that!

1921
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:37,540
Okay.

1922
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,740
You're the That timing.

1923
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:48,920
That timing.

1924
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,140
That timing.

1925
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,940
That timing.

1926
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:57,660
That timing.

1927
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:57,720
That timing.

1928
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,800
Oh, god, that was perfect.

1929
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,160
Yo, I'll save mom.

1930
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,440
I'll save mom.

1931
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,920
Who the fuck cares?

1932
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:06,520
I'll save her.

1933
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,790
Oh, that was actually perfect.

1934
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,430
That was actually perfect.

1935
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:18,630
Oh my god.

1936
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,290
Yo, you did not give a fuck about the sister.

1937
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,510
Please show up so I can chop your hands.

1938
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:28,710
So I can go chop chop.

1939
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:29,690
Chop chop.

1940
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:31,990
Chop chop.

1941
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,590
Chop chop.

1942
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:36,750
Alright, alright.

1943
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,630
All we have to do is wait for the dad, right?

1944
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:40,170
We got everything.

1945
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:43,410
Wait, I have to get shotgun ammo?

1946
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:45,790
Oh, no!

1947
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:48,190
I don't have shotgun ammo.

1948
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:49,090
I didn't know!

1949
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:52,310
No one told me about the shotgun ammo.

1950
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,870
Well, I guess we're gonna get bored again, guys.

1951
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:58,590
Guess we're gonna get...

1952
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:01,550
No one told me.

1953
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,070
Where is the shotgun ammo?

1954
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,810
Where is the shotgun ammo?

1955
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,000
Okay, that...

1956
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,420
There's no shotgun ammo here.

1957
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,380
Where is it?

1958
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:16,780
Where

1959
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:21,780
are you, shotgun ammo?

1960
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,260
No, that is...

1961
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,780
I don't know where shotgun ammo is.

1962
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:28,860
Shotgun ammo?

1963
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,800
Oh, okay, well...

1964
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,600
Well, I tried to find the shotgun ammo and that didn't work.

1965
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,000
Well, then.

1966
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:43,960
Okay, alright.

1967
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:44,680
This is it.

1968
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,560
This is gonna be the run.

1969
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,220
We know everything.

1970
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:47,320
We know everything.

1971
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,180
Where the fuck is the shotgun ammo, though, guys?

1972
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,880
Where the fuck is the shotgun ammo?

1973
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:55,300
Please.

1974
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,660
I need to know what...

1975
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,720
I want this game to be over with.

1976
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:08,010
Where is the gun ammo?

1977
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:08,770
I just...

1978
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:09,390
We just...

1979
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:09,830
We know everything.

1980
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:10,990
We just don't know one thing.

1981
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:16,510
Our one flaw.

1982
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:17,990
Shotgun ammo.

1983
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,840
Please, I want this to be over with.

1984
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:26,440
Alright,

1985
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:36,760
alright.

1986
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:37,420
And then we chop.

1987
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:37,860
We chop.

1988
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:48,500
Okay.

1989
01:17:59,380 --> 01:17:59,780
And...

1990
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,820
Where the heck...

1991
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:01,960
There's a gun ammo in the basement.

1992
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:02,460
You need to bring it.

1993
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,220
Break the face, though.

1994
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:03,860
Okay.

1995
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,300
We got all our information.

1996
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:07,580
We got... Thank you.

1997
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,960
I'm tired of getting bored.

1998
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,860
I was tired of getting bored, guys.

1999
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,900
Oh, I forgot to save my mom.

2000
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,340
What the fuck do I do with a duck, though?

2001
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:21,820
What was the point?

2002
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,140
Of the duck.

2003
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:23,900
You know what?

2004
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,200
I'll go break this.

2005
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,480
I'll go break it.

2006
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:31,320
Yeah.

2007
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:32,940
I'm so bored.

2008
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,880
Alright, ducky.

2009
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:36,920
What do I do with you?

2010
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,680
Do I put the...

2011
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,440
What if I put the duck next to... I'll put the duck next to the trap.

2012
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:48,190
Oh, pfft.

2013
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:52,230
Oh, you just chuck it, apparently.

2014
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:55,270
Alright.

2015
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:58,830
Okay, there we go.

2016
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:00,010
I don't care about you.

2017
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,020
Oh, so much time.

2018
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:06,960
Alright.

2019
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:09,640
And then pick up the sandwich.

2020
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,020
I don't know what to do with that.

2021
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,440
And then...

2022
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,660
And then...

2023
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:23,060
Alright, and then we gotta save ducky.

2024
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,680
Alright, and then we gotta break the vase.

2025
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:30,800
Boop.

2026
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,480
And then one...

2027
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,040
Alright.

2028
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,020
Cat, I need you to...

2029
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:40,520
Okay, okay, and then...

2030
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,080
Woo!

2031
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,580
How do I load the gun?

2032
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,480
Is my gun loaded?

2033
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,100
Alright, I'm gonna assume my gun's loaded.

2034
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:46,920
I'm gonna assume...

2035
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:47,700
Alright, we got everything!

2036
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:49,700
We got everything!

2037
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:51,600
One bullet!

2038
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,180
Okay, maybe I don't...

2039
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,420
Maybe I need more than one bullet.

2040
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:58,000
Maybe I need more than one bullet, you know?

2041
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:58,900
I don't trust myself.

2042
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,460
Here you go, rat.

2043
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,640
Alright, alright, alright.

2044
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:06,000
I sort of don't trust myself here.

2045
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:07,900
Oh!

2046
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:13,870
Oh, I'm sorry!

2047
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,830
Oh, no!

2048
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:16,950
I killed a rat!

2049
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:25,590
I accidentally chopped a rat.

2050
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,370
Goddamnit!

2051
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:30,230
I chopped a rat!

2052
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:39,610
I was a perfect and then I killed his children.

2053
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,720
We almost had the rat!

2054
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,800
We almost had the rat!

2055
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,660
I had to chop the child!

2056
01:20:54,040 --> 01:21:01,020
I had to chop this child!

2057
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:01,880
I'm sorry!

2058
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,900
Oh wait...

2059
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,060
It's the other option.

2060
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:16,240
This word has changed you.

2061
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:20,500
I'm sorry!

2062
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:27,220
I just wanted to chop the... chop the fog!

2063
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:29,100
Oh

2064
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:33,050

2065
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:35,950
Okay, and then chop chop!

2066
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:37,190
Chop chop!

2067
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:41,030
Oh I should put this down first before I chop chop.

2068
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:42,730
Alright, chop chop.

2069
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:46,070
Alright, bye mom!

2070
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:49,170
Okay.

2071
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:51,110
Chop!

2072
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:04,170
Alright, alright, there we go.

2073
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:05,250
We got the speedrun.

2074
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:06,430
Do I even need...

2075
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:08,050
Do I even need this?

2076
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:11,690
I don't really need it.

2077
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:15,130
As good as you're holding the axe you're holding.

2078
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:18,590
I don't need you sister.

2079
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:20,950
I don't need you.

2080
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:22,730
I just need...

2081
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:24,350
I just need ammo.

2082
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:27,030
To load my shotgun.

2083
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,780
Oh, can I kill her?

2084
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,140
Oh, okay, no.

2085
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,480
Alright, bye.

2086
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,680
And then...

2087
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,440
No, that's okay.

2088
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,620
We don't need to save her.

2089
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,680
We don't need to save her.

2090
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,070
Here, take this out.

2091
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:14,290
How do I shoot it?

2092
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:19,130
Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait.

2093
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:20,810
Shadow man, please.

2094
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:21,830
Shadow man, please!

2095
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:23,530
Please, shadow man!

2096
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:24,550
I just wanna do this!

2097
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:26,430
Woo!

2098
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:27,210
Shadow man, please!

2099
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:28,710
Let me, I need more ammo!

Alright, two, two shotgun.

01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,320
There we go, two shots.

01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,340
We got this.

2103
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,260
Two shots and a dream.

2104
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,700
Two shots and a dream.

2105
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:43,900
Oh, cat!

2106
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,320
Cat, cat, cat, cat, cat!

01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,100
There we go.

2109
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:53,980
Alright.

2110
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,000
Alright.

2111
01:23:58,420 --> 01:23:59,380
Did we say mom?

2112
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,600
Let's just say mom for now.

2113
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,640
Let's just say...

2114
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:07,240
We're gonna take doll to the sister?

2115
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:08,100
No, that's okay.

2116
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,300
We don't need the sister.

2117
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,740
We don't need the sister.

2118
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:17,360
Yeah, bitch.

2119
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:18,540
Alright, alright.

We have the shotgun.

01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,480
We have the shotgun.

2123
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:26,560
There we go.

2124
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:26,940
Okay, okay.

2125
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:27,440
We have everything.

2126
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,920
We got everything we need!

2127
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,260
Dad, come up!

2128
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,100
Come here, dad!

2129
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:33,200

Alright, alright, alright.

Alright, alright, daddy.

2134
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:49,050
Alright, dad.

2135
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:51,870
No, I'm not a doll.

2136
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:52,750
I'm a sister.

2137
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:55,990
That's why I'm an o- Why do you think I'm an only child, guys?

2138
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:59,190
Why do you think I'm an only child, guys?

2139
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:05,570
Alright, alright.

2140
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:06,430
Come

Yeah!

2143
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:29,930
I just have a mom!

2144
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,230
We did it!

2145
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:37,710
It only took us 30 minutes, guys.

2146
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,330
We did it!

2147
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:45,710
All we need was two shots.

2148
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:47,270
Dad's dead.

2149
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,410
I get the house!

2150
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:49,870
Oh, I have a cat too!

2151
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,430
I'm a cat and rat!

2152
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:54,470
I get the house!

2153
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:55,710
The house is mine!

2154
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:00,150
And a mom.

2155
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:02,370
I guess that's alright.

2156
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:03,670
I guess that's alright.

2157
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,010
Oh, shit.

2158
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:07,370
It's time to listen to the daily song.

2159
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:07,930
Okay, wait, wait.

2160
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:08,890
Let's listen to the daily song.

2161
01:26:09,090 --> 01:26:11,570
Uh, let's, let's like embrace victory real quick.

2162
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:12,850
The daily song.

2163
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:22,170
Oh, the darkness retreats, but somewhere distant, a fleshy heartbeat continues.

2164
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:26,430
We did it!

2165
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:27,630
Woo!

2166
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:34,670
You'll be the toast of the time, the girl on the- We did it!

2167
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:35,750
More sandwiches!

2168
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:42,410
Oh my god, we actually did it!

2169
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:43,430
The fuck were you?

2170
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:45,530
So you think you've beaten it?

2171
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:47,490
Well, I'm afraid you're terribly wrong.

2172
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:49,090
There's no way to stop it.

2173
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,610
It never ends.

2174
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:51,910
Whoop!

2175
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:54,970
You know what?

2176
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:55,990
You know what, doll?

2177
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,150
I'm gonna end it right here.

2178
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:03,290
I close my eyes.
