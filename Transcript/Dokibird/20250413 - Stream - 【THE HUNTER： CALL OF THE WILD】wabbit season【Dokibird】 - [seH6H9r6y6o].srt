00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,830
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,470
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,330
Welcome, welcome.

4
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,430
Today we're gonna be playing The Hunter Call of the Wild.

5
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,490
So like, I've always wanted to try this game out because it's basically like a hunting simulator.

6
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,890
And I've never been on an actual hunt hunt before.

7
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,910
The only thing I know about hunting is like...

8
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,670
Okay, it's not really hunt.

9
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,690
It's duck hunt.

10
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,090
That's like the only thing I know about hunting is from duck hunt the game.

11
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,290
But like, I thought it was really interesting.

12
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,470
I always see this game on Steam sell a lot and it does have a lot of reviews.

13
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,590
And then I found out it is like a very...

14
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,130
So the thing is, I found out that this game is a very accurate simulation of hunting.

15
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,110
And I was like, oh, how accurate can it be?

16
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:46,650
Well, I was reading the reviews and they're like, oh man, it feels like I'm out there right now in the woods.

17
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,470
Like I'm a hunter.

18
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,610
And it really does simulate it very well.

19
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,190
And like, you know, just waiting there, sitting in the grass, just waiting for the animal to approach.

20
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,710
And then you gotta wait patiently and everything until you hit the perfect shot.

21
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,750
Like you align your perfect shot to get him.

22
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,070
And you gotta make sure you don't spook the animals and all that stuff.

23
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,850
And I was like, all right, that seems like... That definitely seems like a game for me.

24
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:28,910
Because as we all know, I am very well known for my patience, my attention span, and not running around like my head was cut off.

25
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,990
That is 100% a go-keeper game right there.

26
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,870
I should play it.

27
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,970
I should try it out.

28
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,010
I did buy DLC for this game.

29
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,470
Because, okay, I bought two DLCs.

30
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,770
One was I wanted to hunt in Canada.

31
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,750
So there was a Yukon Valley.

32
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,410
And I was like, oh my god, that's Canada.

33
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,270
I was like, I might as well get fully immersed, you know.

34
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,390
So I was like, I want to go to Canada while I'm hunting.

35
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,870
It was either Finland or Canada.

36
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,230
And I was like, I should pick Canada.

37
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,010
And you can shoot ducks and stuff.

38
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,110
And then the other DLC I bought was the Golden Retriever one.

39
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,830
Because like, I wanted comfort.

40
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,230
Yeah, so I can be at home.

41
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,290
And then the other one I bought was the dog DLC.

42
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,930
Because I wanted a dog with me to go on this hunt.

43
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,790
I wanted dad to come there here with me.

44
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,550
They had like a bloodhound.

45
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,650
But I was like, I don't really like bloodhounds.

46
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,590
Because, you know, they always look like they're depressed.

47
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,550
So I didn't want to have that vibe going into my hunt.

48
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:42,030
So I decided to get the Golden Retriever DLC.

49
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,550
But yeah, anyway, I'm really looking forward to trying this game out.

50
00:04:48,550 --> 00:05:01,090
In other news, in other like life update news, did you guys see that like Marvel Rivals like sneaked in a secret cosmetic update into the game?

51
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,070
Did you guys hear about that?

52
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:10,790
So all the men, all the men in Marvel Rivals got like,

53
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,890
got a Brazilian butt lift.

54
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:25,290
So they all, they flew, they flew all the Marvel characters, all the Marvel men.

55
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,950
They got the BPL upgrade.

56
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,530
They got the Brazilian butt lift surgery.

57
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,090
They flew them to Brazil.

58
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,810
They went to Brazil, guys!

59
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,290
They knew what we want.

60
00:05:48,230 --> 00:06:00,910
And they like, uh, not only that, but they also, uh, they also enhanced Wolverine's crouch.

61
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,330
Did you guys see that one?

62
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,150
Okay, wait, wait, let me show you guys.

63
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,650
I, I, I thought that was fucking crazy.

64
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,590
Like, Wolverine also got a buff too.

65
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:28,310
I don't know if the other ones did, but I, Wolverine got, oh, I didn't know that.

66
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,170
Wait, let me see if I can find it.

67
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,250
I saw it on my Twitter.

68
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:48,810
Oh man, I don't know if I like, uh, if I liked the tweet, but I don't know if I should have, but they actually, yeah, they, they, they buffed that too.

69
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:56,030
I wish I was joking, but, uh, I thought that was so fucking funny.

70
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:03,590
I was like, wait, wait, okay, the butt, I understand, like all of them needed.

71
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:09,410
I retweeted, okay, look, I retweeted the butt version because like, that's important news, guys.

72
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,770
That is incredible.

73
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,410
That, that is like, extra, extra, read all about it.

74
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,190
Biggest update.

75
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,150
Wait, wait, the day, the tweet got deleted.

76
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,830
Oh, I know, I did it, okay.

77
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,810
Okay, it didn't get deleted.

78
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,830
I was gonna, I was gonna worry.

79
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,810
I was like, oh my god, where is the retweet?

80
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,870
I, okay, wait, I'm gonna, I thought they deleted the butt retweet, the, the butt enhancements.

81
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,970
Um, oh my god, where's the, where's the crouch?

82
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,650
Where's the, I found, I swear it's true.

83
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,090
I saw it, and I was like, oh my god.

84
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:52,770
Also, for those who wanted to see it, I still can't believe, I can't, I can't believe they, like, made it perkier.

85
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,430
And like, they said nothing about it.

86
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:07,210
That's like, the funniest part, like, the, obviously the devs didn't want to say anything about it, but like, it was like, a secret update.

87
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:16,890
Like, the fact that, the fact that it was like, a fucking secret update, and there was no mention of it.

88
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,730
And they just, like, the silent buff.

89
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,710
All right, let's see if I can find it.

90
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,630
Guys, no, you don't understand, this is very important.

91
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,050
I, I literally, I saw the tweet of it.

92
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,450
I was like, oh my god.

93
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,470
It's like, oh, oh my god.

94
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,370
Let's see if I can find it.

95
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,830
No, guys, you don't understand.

96
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,230
This is, like, the most important.

97
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,460
All right, I can't find the tweet anymore.

98
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,000
I swear to god, I saw it.

99
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,300
I swear to god.

100
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,480
I saw, like, the pictures.

101
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,060
I, I, I, holy shit.

102
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,360
I saw, I saw the comparison.

103
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,860
It was just, like, the butt comparison, but, like, on the front.

104
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,460
Don't worry, I saw it too.

105
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,960
Thank you, thank you for the validation, guys.

106
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,100
I, I really appreciate the validation that you guys give me.

107
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,920
Oh, yeah.

108
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,220
Oh, yeah, there you go.

109
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Here you go, guys.

110
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,540
Here you go.

111
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,440
I found it.

112
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,800
It's in the replies.

113
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,620
That's actually crazy.

114
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:31,660
Here.

115
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,360
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,400
It's so tough.

117
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,860
It's like, I don't understand.

118
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,260
They, they, they hired, they hired a mother.

119
00:09:47,480 --> 00:10:03,860
It's like, okay, guys, people are complaining that the men aren't sexy enough, so, um, we, we need you to plump up those asses for season two.

120
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:17,940
Imagine, imagine being the modeler, and your entire job that day was to make sure their asses are more plump and then squeezable.

121
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,340
They understood the assignment.

122
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,660
They, they really did.

123
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:33,980
The day Marvel, the day Marvel rivals decided to get serious.

124
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,020
It's a very important job.

125
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:55,580
Um, like, I, I don't understand why, why they had to, um, okay, like, I don't understand why they had to touch Wolverine's front.

126
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,080
Oh my god, like, adding a bigger bulge.

127
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:20,520
Okay, um, I also, like, to the people that discovered this too, he was, yeah, Wolverine was feeling a bit insecure, and, you know, he didn't want to be, like, just a short king, you know.

128
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:38,360
Um, uh, but, like, uh, and it's, okay, and the fact that it's only Wolverine too, like, only, only Wolverine got affected in the front.

129
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:47,760
Everybody else was just for the back, like, I was like, I'm just like, okay, all right, we're really talking about equality here.

130
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,100
I feel like it can't just only be Wolverine, you know.

131
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,300
Why is it just him?

132
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,000
If we're all, I mean, we're gonna start going there, we might as well do it for everybody else.

133
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,920
Because he's a short king, you don't understand.

134
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,340
It's for Lord Doki.

135
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,560
He was trying to be comic book accurate.

136
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,820
Someone on, someone on the dev team was, who is a Wolverine main, and they got really insecure.

137
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,860
They had a very, they had a rough day with his wife.

138
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:39,440
He had a rough day with his wife, and he got really insecure, so he decided to make the perfect being.

139
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,280
Um, anyway, so that's, that is an important life update, guys.

140
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,540
I just, I had to update you guys on this, because I, it was very important.

141
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,960
Like, one of the most important patches any video game has ever done.

142
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:15,120
I swear to god, I have never heard of a video game, especially in a competitive game, like a competitive, like, multiplayer game, where they decide to enhance the butt and the bulge.

143
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,780
But like, they didn't say anything about it.

144
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,640
That was, that's the craziest shit.

145
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,660
They said nothing about it, like, it just happened.

146
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:36,520
Like, they just, even when I was in an early access, I swear to god, nobody noticed in early access, but like, maybe they sneaked it in for season two.

147
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,660
They know their player.

148
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,400
It's an extremely important update, Doki.

149
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,620
You don't understand.

150
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,580
Look, you're right.

151
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,560
All we see for the characters are their backside, so they are like, all right, we gotta give them more to look at, you know.

152
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,220
We gotta give these people more to look at, the priorities.

153
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,980
Aifen, thank you for the super chat.

154
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,840
Thank you, thank you.

155
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,360
I assure you, Doki, making everyone more sexy is imperative to the competency.

156
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,240
You're right, you're right.

157
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm so, how foolish am I?

158
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,300
I can't believe I would judge them.

159
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,000
You're right.

160
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,660
You know what?

161
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,960
In fact, I feel like they could have done more.

162
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,160
I feel like, you know what?

163
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,580
They should have, if they're gonna do all that, they might as well just gave all of them twerking emotes at that point.

164
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,260
Like, like, they all deserve it.

165
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:38,140
Like, it's a crime to hide such a beautiful job, um, when they flew them to Brazil.

166
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,800
To hide such a beautiful job, and they can't even use it.

167
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,040
Like, you know, like, what's the point?

168
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,720
Why can't they just flaunt what they have?

169
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,340
True.

170
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,060
Everyone should be throwing their ass on cart.

171
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,220
Exactly, exactly.

172
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,080
Then we'll finally achieve world peace.

173
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Uh, Momohaku, thank you for the super chat.

174
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,580
Thank you, thank you.

175
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,240
Kick is a lie, but butts don't lie.

176
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,880
Thank you for the super chat.

177
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,820
Thank you, thank you.

178
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,600
Celeste, thank you for the super chat.

179
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,460
Thank you, thank you.

180
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,800
Imagine being at the meeting room and telling your boss why the male characters need bigger asses.

181
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:31,280
Imagine being the animation, the art director, and was like, attention all 3D modelers, this is your new assignment before season two hits.

182
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,000
Thank you for the super chat.

183
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,120
Thank you, thank you.

184
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,420
Um, Anton, thank you for the super chat.

185
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,480
Thank you, thank you.

186
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,420
Now Thor's cheeks truly befit a god of thunder.

187
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,380
Thank you for the super chat.

188
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
Thank you, thank you.

189
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,180
Um, Wizword, thank you for the super chat.

190
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,100
Thank you, thank you.

191
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,440
Hi Doki, lejoma.

192
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I actually emailed your business email last year with stream key, scene key to call a while.

193
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,460
I thought you actually redeemed it.

194
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,220
Thank you for the super chat.

195
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,820
Thank you, thank you.

196
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,040
Okay, I didn't know that.

197
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,700
I, I bought the thing.

198
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,560
I bought it myself.

199
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,540
I bought the game myself, but all right, free, free steam key.

200
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,420
Let's go.

201
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,880
Not for me though.

202
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,340
I already have the game now.

203
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,940
I literally bought it today.

204
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,920
Thank you for the super chat.

205
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,920
Thank you, thank you.

206
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,400
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

207
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,240
Thank you, thank you.

208
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,120
You don't understand.

209
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,480
The bigger bulge is integral to the character development between season one and... What happened?

210
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,180
What happened to Logan in season one and two?

211
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,380
Where did he go?

212
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,820
Did someone like shot him in the crotch and then he regenerated it bigger?

213
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,220
Like, is that what his powers are?

214
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,320
Who cut his dick off?

215
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,900
Did something happen?

216
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,640
Yep, he saw it.

217
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,960
Yes, that is exactly who.

218
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,080
Like, does it regenerate bigger when it gets damaged?

219
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,760
Like, how does that work?

220
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,760
How does this regeneration work?

221
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,020
I don't understand.

222
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,140
Bro's a lizard.

223
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,140
Depot, thank you for the super chat.

224
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,060
Thank you, thank you.

225
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,740
Speaking of cake, it's my birthday today.

226
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,920
Can I have a happy birthday song?

227
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,060
Of course you can!

228
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,420
Hime, happy birthday to you.

229
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,460
Happy birthday to you.

230
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,560
Happy birthday, dear Hime.

231
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,520
Happy birthday to you.

232
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
Yeah, happy birthday!

233
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,140
Happy birthday!

234
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,100
Also, I don't know.

235
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,680
It got bigger when Emma Frost got introduced into the game.

236
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,680
Coincidence?

237
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,380
Maybe he did it to himself.

238
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,700
All right, anyway.

239
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,280
Anyways, let's play Hunter Call of the Wild.

240
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:09,360
Like I said, I don't really know much about it other than the Steam description and watching the trailer, so I have no idea what's gonna happen to me.

241
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,380
Well, I know nothing's gonna happen.

242
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,900
Like, 80% of the game is just nothing happening or some shit.

243
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,540
All right, here we go.

244
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,280
All right, I accept.

245
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,180
I already read everything.

246
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,780
Okay, there you go.

247
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,560
I have to pretend to read everything.

248
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,640
No.

249
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,800
Skip.

250
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,200
Okay, I don't want to connect in my account.

251
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,520
All right, let's see.

252
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,300
Yeah, I read everything.

253
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,600
Do you guys know I'm a speed reader?

254
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,740
I'm not a good speed reader.

255
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,960
Okay, let's see.

256
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,600
Not window, full screen.

257
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,860
19, 20.

258
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,820
Okay, we're not.

259
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,060
Okay, maybe high.

260
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,180
I feel like I feel like ultra it might be a little.

261
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,880
Oh wait, can I?

262
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,040
Oh wait, field of view.

263
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,400
I'll put it on default.

264
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,020
I don't know if it'll affect or anything.

265
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,660
Okay, motion blur off.

266
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,200
Depth of field, everything.

267
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,920
Yeah, that should be good.

268
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,280
Wait, oops, I forgot to save it.

269
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,060
Oopsie.

270
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,480
Wait, where's the?

271
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:20,840
Okay.

272
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,560
Oh my god.

273
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,620
It's like.

274
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay, there you go.

275
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:26,980
Wait, is it?

276
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,440
Give me.

277
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,180
Give me full screen.

278
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,660
Oh, apply.

279
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:30,980
Oops.

280
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,520
It's like.

281
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,940
Where's my full screen?

282
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,780
Okay, motion blur.

283
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,520
Default was 60, so.

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,140
Alright, my DSC store.

285
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,920
I mean, I bought.

286
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,500
Okay, where's the one?

287
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,040
Yeah, there you go.

288
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,480
See guys?

289
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,740
I bought the Yukon and I bought a dog.

290
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,880
Okay, new game.

291
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,240
What options do I have?

292
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,380
Who looks like an actor?

293
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:02,880
Oh, wait.

294
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:03,820
Alright.

295
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,020
I want to go to the Yukon.

296
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,540
Okay, Yukon Nature Reserve.

297
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,880
Treasures back thousands of years.

298
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,720
Alright, we're into Alaska from Siberia.

299
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,200
Wait, wait, this isn't.

300
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,060
Wait, what?

301
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,100
Yukon Valley.

302
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,200
Is this owned by America?

303
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,960
Is this Alaska?

304
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,900
No, that can't be it.

305
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,220
The Yukon belongs to Canada.

306
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,040
Okay, it's in Canada.

307
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,720
I was gonna say, why is Alaska involved?

308
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,740
Like, get out of here.

309
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,240
This is.

310
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,060
I was gonna be like.

311
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,700
Why does he have a name?

312
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,960
Wait, how come everybody else is like option one, two, three, four, five?

313
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,900
And then there's Remy.

314
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,780
I'm gonna be Remy.

315
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,960
I was like, what is America doing here?

316
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,500
This is Canadian territory.

317
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,960
It's the fucking Yukon.

318
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,680
Get out, Alaska.

319
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,580
You don't belong here.

320
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,600
Alright, I'm gonna be Remy because he has a name.

321
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,380
I want to be a real person.

322
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,720
Alright, let me know this sounds okay.

323
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,180
So, let me grab.

324
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Oh, turn the music down?

325
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,320
Okay, I will.

326
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,080
I will when I arrive in the Yukon.

327
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,860
That's me.

328
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,940
Yeah, this entire area is Simba.

329
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,740
Anywhere the sun touches belongs to you.

330
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,220
Okay.

331
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,480
Is there a tutorial?

332
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,720
I have no idea how to play this game.

333
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,760
Produce just joining.

334
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,180
Shots missed 104 shots.

335
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,420
I just started the game.

336
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,680
What do you mean?

337
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,180
Cranberry, thank you for the super chat.

338
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,640
Thank you.

339
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,640
Thank you.

340
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,700
A trampede?

341
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,380
Welcome to Alaska?

342
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,120
Wait.

343
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,840
Oh, no, I am in Alaska.

344
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,240
God damn it.

345
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,560
I bought this just to be in Canada.

346
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,320
I can't believe it.

347
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,120
No matter where I go, I'm still in.

348
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,620
I'm still in America.

349
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,160
God fucking damn it.

350
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,160
Okay, let's see.

351
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,340
Is there no tutorial?

352
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,140
Did they just drop me down here and just be like, alright, you learn.

353
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,700
Oh, there is.

354
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.

355
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,780
You can probably see the look.

356
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,200
Okay.

357
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,800
Just up the hill from where I dropped you.

358
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,400
Can I just?

359
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,160
There's no way.

360
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,860
I have to manually.

361
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,640
There's no way.

362
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,320
I have to manually press this.

363
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,240
It's always good to know where you can rest your head after

364
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,100
visitors.

365
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:03,780
Okay.

366
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
I don't mind which one you travel to.

367
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,700
Meet.

368
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,540
Thank you for the 20.

369
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,200
Get the ships.

370
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,560
Thank you.

371
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,420
Thank you.

372
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,860
I can't believe it.

373
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,260
I thought I could go back.

374
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,780
I thought I could be in Canada.

375
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,640
I'm stuck in America.

376
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,220
I can never leave.

377
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,100
The map is on the- When did America co-own the Yukon?

378
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,120
The fuck?

379
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,020
Did you guys just slowly expand into the Yukon?

380
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,340
Like Alaska is Alaska.

381
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,700
Oh shit, that's my meds.

382
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,260
Like, did you guys just slowly started like encroaching the territory like a fucking Zerg creep?

383
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,020
When did you guys got part of the Yukon?

384
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,000
Yukon is always belong to Canada.

385
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,520
That's where like the famous- Oh my god.

386
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,100
Hey, there's poop.

387
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,620
Oh shit.

388
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,680
That's a very fresh grizzly bear poop.

389
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,880
Oh, he's- Oh, he flew away because I was running.

390
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,440
There's no way Russia gave you half the Yukon.

391
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,100
There's no fucking way- I refuse to believe it.

392
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:35,020
I feel like you're just slowly expanding your territory as if we didn't notice because like 50% of Canada is uninhabited by real people.

393
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:44,020
So, he just slowly just- He just slowly just started spreading your fucking seed into Canadian territory.

394
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,300
Like, yes.

395
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,960
There's no fucking way.

396
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,240
Like, we literally have a show.

397
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,920
A Canadian show based off of the Yukon.

398
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,600
What was his name?

399
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,440
That like- Oh my god, I already forgot his name.

400
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:15,380
It was a Canadian show based off of like being in the Yukon and it's called- It's like about like this guy that was frozen in ice and he got unfrozen.

401
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,020
Yvonne of the Yukon.

402
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,800
Yeah, Yvonne of the Yukon.

403
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,500
Didn't he never say anything about the Americans?

404
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,800
He never- Oh, Ivan.

405
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,020
They never said anything about the fucking Alaskans that co-owned the Yukon.

406
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,200
It was always Canada.

407
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,660
Yeah.

408
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,420
All right.

409
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,600
You're at the top.

410
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,560
Can you see the outpost?

411
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,040
They have half of them of the Yukon.

412
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,500
I normally do a routine check of an outpost to

413
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,080
investigate.

414
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,620
All right.

415
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,840
Bear

416
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,970
knocking on the door.

417
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,230
Okay, so we don't want to die to the bear.

418
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,890
All right, I got that.

419
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:09,210
Okay, so that's where- Okay, so there's the grizzly bear that's just roaming around.

420
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,830
Like, it's not fair.

421
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,190
The only reason why- Okay, wait.

422
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,110
Let me try- Wait, I want to see what the gunshot is like.

423
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,210
There's nobody here anyway, so I can just shoot my gun.

424
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,550
You think there's, like, an animal that's just roaming around?

425
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,610
Maybe I'll find an animal that's just casually roaming.

426
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,730
Where are they?

427
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,310
There's nobody here.

428
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,750
Where are all the animals?

429
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,930
There's no way there's no animals just around my surroundings.

430
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,090
No, I have four- Don't worry.

431
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,030
I have four or five bullets.

432
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:50,710
It's fine.

433
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,470
Is there nothing around me?

434
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,490
A wind and there's bullet troughs?

435
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:58,930
Okay.

436
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,390
Okay, we're really hunting now.

437
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,910
Don't understand.

438
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,110
How is there nothing but around me?

439
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,070
There has to be, like, a little rabbit or something.

440
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:19,790
Why would you protect this area if the animals aren't thriving and fucking and making more animals?

441
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,410
What's the point?

442
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,090
What's the point?

443
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,590
All right, let's see.

444
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,750
So that's my men's.

445
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,610
What is this?

446
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,010
Okay, now I know that, but like, what am I holding right now?

447
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,790
Oh, it's a duck call.

448
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,010
Any ducks?

449
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,130
Hello?

450
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,550
Hello?

451
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:56,870
Hello?

452
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,010
I'm just a vulnerable duck right now.

453
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,270
Oh, I'm so- Oh, wait.

454
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,330
Is that- Oh, those are the bear tracks.

455
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,590
I'm gonna examine.

456
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,790
Be very, very quiet.

457
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,590
I'm hunting bears.

458
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,570
Airborne Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

459
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,570
Thank you, thank you.

460
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,270
You need to actually track animals to find them in this game?

461
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,210
Oh shit, I didn't know that.

462
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,530
Oh my god, it's just like- That's not- Oh my gosh, what do you mean you have to track animals?

463
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,450
This is the wild.

464
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,190
Animals should be, like, everywhere.

465
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,930
They should be around me.

466
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:47,590
What's the point of protecting them if I can't- If I can't kill them for my pleasure.

467
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,110
What's the point?

468
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,630
Oh, okay, that should make noise, right?

469
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,250
All right, I'm following these bear tracks.

470
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,510
Johnny Lacone, thank you for the super chat.

471
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,430
Thank you, thank you.

472
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,230
So, hear me out.

473
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,890
Dookie Bear, who do you with?

474
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,970
Oh, he's over here.

475
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,870
He's trotting along.

476
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,410
He's over here.

477
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,870
Dookie, you're not a troop.

478
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,930
Wait, what am I?

479
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,910
Wait, people hunt for not pleasure?

480
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,590
Then what's the point of hunting?

481
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,570
Wait, what's the point of hunting?

482
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,910
Like, I feel like if it's not for- Like, it can't be for food.

483
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,610
You can just go and buy that now.

484
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,670
Food?

485
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,610
You just go to the grocery store.

486
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,770
There's no way I'm hunting a fucking bear for food.

487
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,030
I'm- I'm calling invasive.

488
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,790
He lives here!

489
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,470
How is he invasive?

490
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,910
This bear lives here.

491
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,970
I'm literally trying to kill Winnie the Pooh right now.

492
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,270
Wow, he's like trying to eat his honey.

493
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:05,570
Again, my local market doesn't sell bear.

494
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:06,810
All right.

495
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,600
Okay, he's somewhere around here.

496
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,440
Dookie!

497
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,700
Bear's a known squatter.

498
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,160
He didn't- Mr. Pooh didn't pay rent.

499
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,840
Ever since he went public domain, he thought he can squat here for free.

500
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,520
He missed his final notice, so I'm here to get the job done.

501
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,240
Yeah, this is- this is Monster Hunter, guys.

502
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,600
This is called, uh, uh, this is Realistic Monster Hunter.

503
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,160
All right.

504
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,700
Where did his tracks go?

505
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,400
Oh, it's over here.

506
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:55,740
Okay.

507
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,640
Don't worry, guys.

508
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,880
I'll catch Mr.- I'll catch the squatter.

509
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,520
He lives here.

510
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,500
Dookie, this is America and that bear is trespassing on private property.

511
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,260
Wait, this is very old.

512
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,760
Where did he go?

513
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,440
Wait, do I have to go here?

514
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,000
Where's there?

515
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,960
Place waypoint.

516
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,120
Oh, I have to go.

517
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,580
Okay, I guess I'm not JK.

518
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,680
We're not going to the bear now.

519
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,320
We have to go.

520
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,660
We have to go back home.

521
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,440
All right, I'll be back.

522
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:37,940
Sorry, I was too busy trying to complete my job as, um, um, a dead collector.

523
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,040
All right, I'll be back, Mr. Pooh.

524
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,380
You think you could just squat here in my private property like that?

525
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,840
Welcome to America.

526
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,900
All right.

527
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay, let me turn up the game a little bit for us.

528
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,820
All right, let me know if this is better.

529
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,500
All right.

530
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,120
Oh, bother.

531
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,020
All right, I'm heading over.

532
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,100
I'm gonna start running.

533
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,960
No freeloaders.

534
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,480
I have to go home to get my, get my car.

535
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,930
I know it

536
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,670
might seem trivial, but can you take a look at the trash can and make sure that it's locked?

537
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,710
It's a bear proof trash can with a tricky catch.

538
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,330
I don't want to take any chances.

539
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,710
All right, I'm gonna check the trash, but wouldn't I want the trash to be open?

540
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,530
So like, oh it is open.

541
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,870
Yeah.

542
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,510
Okay, let me close it.

543
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,310
Oh my god.

544
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,190
That's so loud.

545
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,080
Or I'm claiming this post like it's a fa- Like, like what was that other game?

546
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,400
The game where I had to claim posts and stuff?

547
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,560
And I was hunting in the wild?

548
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,900
One last thing.

549
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:17,040
Before you move on, can you take a look at the- For Far Cry.

550
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,060
Yeah, I like Far Cry.

551
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,680
This is basically Far Cry, Far Cry 3.

552
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,040
Okay.

553
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,880
Oh, okay.

554
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,200
So these are my, all my guns.

555
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,820
Oh, I should have bought DLC for guns.

556
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,360
Where's my dog?

557
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,000
My dogs.

558
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,900
Wait, what?

559
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,480
I have to buy a dog?

560
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,520
I already bought you!

561
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,180
What do you mean?

562
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,140
Oh wait, it's free.

563
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,840
Okay, nice.

564
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,880
Oh nice, it's already free.

565
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,280
Okay, buy a name.

566
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,940
Okay, nice.

567
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,220
Doki Amber Doge.

568
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,060
Dad.

569
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,360
Okay.

570
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,500
Wait, actually yeah.

571
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,160
Dad.

572
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,660
Dad.

573
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,080
Doki Amber Doge.

574
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,500
You're a big boy now.

575
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,220
Okay, sorry, I can't do that.

576
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,840
All right, I can't, okay.

577
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,200
Dad.

578
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,140
All right.

579
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,260
Yay!

580
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,180
All right, come over here.

581
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,480
Where are you?

582
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,580
Where are you?

583
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,720
Oh, there you are!

584
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,240
Look, it's him!

585
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,820
What a good boy.

586
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,520
Okay.

587
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,500
Okay, so I have to...

588
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,690
Yeah, he dyed his hair.

589
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,850
He's going through a midlife crisis right now, so he dyed his hair blonde.

590
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,630
And got a Ferrari.

591
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,950
Oh my god, I actually... Wait, I actually have a tutorial now.

592
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,450
Hello, dad!

593
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,370
You got a Ferrari and like a motorcycle.

594
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:21,770
Hello!

595
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,990
Who's a good boy?

596
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,710
You are!

597
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,750
That's right, it's you!

598
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,790
Let's play!

599
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,010
Come on!

600
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,770
Oh no!

601
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,310
You're already smarter than me!

602
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,930
Oh my god, thank god you went through your midlife crisis.

603
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,810
You're already smarter than you were like yesterday.

604
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,090
All right, who's a good boy?

605
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,470
Oh, yes, you are!

606
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,490
All right, it's used as it can also be currently tabbed to bring out the hunter mate.

607
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,010
Oh my god, it's my iPhone.

608
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,410
Okay, travel.

609
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,370
Wait, I have to go somewhere else.

610
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,910
Oh my god, when do I hunt?

611
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,570
Why am I doing errands?

612
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,390
What?

613
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:02,810
Okay.

614
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,090
Why am I doing errands?

615
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,590
I thought it was all... I thought I was supposed to be hunting.

616
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,630
All right, it's over here.

617
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,530
All right, dad.

618
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,090
Come over here.

619
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:12,630
Come here.

620
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,670
Come here, boy!

621
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,630
Why are we idling?

622
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,010
Come with me!

623
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,650
All right.

624
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,450
Let's see you.

625
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,110
Oh my god, lay down.

626
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,570
Come on, lay down.

627
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,250
Good boy.

628
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,530
Good boy, dad.

629
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,110
All right.

630
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:31,830
All right.

631
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:34,770
Retrieve.

632
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,310
What is he retrieving?

633
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,470
I don't know.

634
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,290
Get me something.

635
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,830
I don't know.

636
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,850
You go get something.

637
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,650
I don't know what you're... okay, he's gone now.

638
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,130
Guys, what the... what is the bear gonna do?

639
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,450
Use my fucking bed?

640
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,950
I have nothing in this house.

641
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,110
Like, oh, he's gonna get a gun?

642
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,650
He's gonna... he's gonna shoot me with my gun?

643
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,990
I'd like to see him try.

644
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:58,750
You know what?

645
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,770
I'm opening that door.

646
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,850
Let's fucking fight.

647
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,770
Did he... did my dog went to get milk and cigarettes?

648
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,470
Like, what are you retrieving?

649
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:11,410
What?

650
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,990
What is he... what are you retrieving?

651
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,210
What are you trying to get?

652
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,330
Did you get anything?

653
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,910
All right, sit.

654
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:22,710
Sit.

655
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,250
Come on, boy.

656
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:23,850
Sit.

657
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,890
Let me push you right here so I can see you, but let me...

658
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,190
push you right here.

659
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,890
So, you wanna go on a swim?

660
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:30,910
Boy?

661
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,150
I'm gonna teach you how to swim today.

662
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,650
You wanna swim, boy?

663
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,270
You wanna swim?

664
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,110
Into the lake you go.

665
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,790
It's okay.

666
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,230
He's a really good swimmer.

667
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,970
Wait, can he die?

668
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,330
Wait, is he okay?

669
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,950
All right, lay down.

670
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,740
Oh, okay, okay.

671
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,540
He's getting out.

672
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,200
No.

673
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,180
Good boy.

674
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,160
Good boy.

675
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:13,640
See?

676
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,980
You see?

677
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,760
A good... a good soldier right there listens to orders.

678
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,220
He's very loyal.

679
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,660
See?

680
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,580
He's a good... he's a really good boy.

681
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,560
Please help me.

682
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,440
I am underwater.

683
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:31,680
All right.

684
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,520
Uh, good boy.

685
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,140
Oh my god, you are such a good boy.

686
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,460
That's right.

687
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,000
You... you are a good soldier and a very loyal one.

688
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,540
All right.

689
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,320
All right.

690
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:49,880
All right, come on, boy.

691
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,760
Come on.

692
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,080
What's... why is he healing?

693
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,000
Why are you healing?

694
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,640
What's going on?

695
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,380
Sit.

696
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,160
Sit.

697
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,680
Come on.

698
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,500
Are you okay?

699
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,860
Is it because I made you sit in the water?

700
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,860
Come on.

701
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,340
You know, it was just a joke, right?

702
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,400
Oh, he leveled up!

703
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,120
He's awesome!

704
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,000
He likes it!

705
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,580
He likes it, guys!

706
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,940
Because you... no, no, no!

707
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,660
He... yeah, I made him stronger.

708
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,840
Guys, I... I made him stronger.

709
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,760
He leveled up.

710
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,960
Now, he can breathe underwater longer, guys.

711
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,340
Nice.

712
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,600
Hey, good job!

713
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,300
See?

714
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,040
Showing affection towards your dog will increase his focus regeneration.

715
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,240
See, guys?

716
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,300
That's affection right there.

717
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,780
That's how you love a dog.

718
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,580
All right, good boy.

719
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,540
Who's a good boy?

720
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,040
Who didn't drown?

721
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,700
Oh, you are!

722
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,600
That's right!

723
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,540
Dad, you didn't drown!

724
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,240
You're such a good boy!

725
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,140
All right, come on, let's go.

726
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,340
Follow me.

727
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,920
How do I make him follow me?

728
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,400
Come on.

729
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,360
This is all about following me.

730
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,400
All right, come on.

731
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,820
Come on, follow me.

732
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,860
Why don't you want to follow me?

733
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,920
Come on, let's go.

734
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,720
Let's go.

735
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,240
We're gonna go hunting today.

736
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,700
Oh, we just walk away?

737
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,500
Okay.

738
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,420
If you walk away, it'll make them want you more.

739
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,000
Okay, includes bushes, hides you, but it's... oh, okay.

740
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,340
Wait, but he's not following me.

741
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,460
Wait, did I tell him to stay?

742
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,320
No, I didn't.

743
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,740
I just told him to sit.

744
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,100
That's different.

745
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,420
All right.

746
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,320
Oh, there's an animal call.

747
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,600
Okay.

748
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,540
Uh, do not sit anymore.

749
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,280
Stop sitting.

750
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,700
Okay, stop.

751
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,680
Stop sitting.

752
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,340
I'm petting you.

753
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,940
You stop sitting.

754
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,160
You understand?

755
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,800
How do I make you stop sitting?

756
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,620
Okay, lay down.

757
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,480
Okay, uh...

758
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,320
Retrieve.

759
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,600
All right.

760
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,660
Okay, nice.

761
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,120
Okay, now he's gonna retrieve stuff.

762
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,040
I don't know what he's gonna retrieve.

763
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,620
Oh my god.

764
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,880
No, don't drown yourself again!

765
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,360
No!

766
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,620
That was just a...

767
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,520
Stop!

768
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,800
Stop!

769
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,100
Come back!

770
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,660
You're strong enough!

771
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,880
Come back!

772
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,300
No!

773
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,200
What are you doing?

774
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,700
He's crossing...

775
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,100
Don't go to Canada!

776
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,780
You don't have a passport!

777
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:46,280
They're cracking down on people legally crossing the border now!

778
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,120
We don't have... We're not friends with them anymore!

779
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,240
We're not friends with them anymore!

780
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,060
Come back!

781
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,100
You can't go to Canada!

782
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,500
They're gonna deport you back!

783
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:58,880
They're gonna...

784
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,600
He's going... He's crossing the border.

785
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,780
He's going.

786
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,260
He's retrieving.

787
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,520
They're gonna deport you!

788
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,220
And it's not gonna be to Alaska!

789
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,520
This is what happens when Dookie's dog isn't confined.

790
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,820
Come back!

791
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,660
He's like, go get him, champ!

792
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,720
Dad is retrieving Canada!

793
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,660
He's gonna get the job done!

794
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,820
Come back here!

795
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:42,180
Okay, all right, let's actually let's... we're just... okay, I have to go there.

796
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,200
All right, we gotta go in there.

797
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,380
He's gonna take Canada back.

798
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,480
He's gonna make Canada the 51st state with a one dog army.

799
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,640
He's gonna make Canada the 51st state with a one dog army.

800
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,340
He'll follow me, right?

801
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,540
Oh, he's gonna follow me.

802
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,480
I believe in him.

803
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,060
Look at him.

804
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,060
He's swimming back.

805
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,860
He realized he can't do this alone.

806
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,280
Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

807
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:08,680
Thank you.

808
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,300
Thank you.

809
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,660
Who wants to visit a babysitter really bad?

810
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,920
Thank you for the super chat.

811
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,300
Thank you.

812
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,000
Thank you.

813
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,260
All right, let's go to... is he following me?

814
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,680
Oh, he is.

815
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,320
Okay, nice.

816
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:21,820
That's right.

817
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,500
Come over here.

818
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,280
We're gonna go.

819
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,100
We're gonna go to get some wood.

820
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,460
This is like... it's not even a hunt.

821
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,400
Oh, wait, there's deer.

822
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,100
Wait a minute.

823
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,640
Okay, wait, I want to hunt deer.

824
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,280
Forgotten, thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

825
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:34,660
Thank you.

826
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,420
Thank you.

827
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,160
All right.

828
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,020
Oh, let's get the deer tracker.

829
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,400
All right, I know I should be retrieving wood, but like there's deer prints here.

830
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,700
This might be my first kill.

831
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,200
I'm slowly walking over because I don't want to spook anything.

832
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,860
Don't worry.

833
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,660
I'm heading to the... I'm very slowly walking to the deer tracks right now.

834
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,940
I'm gonna make it.

835
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,480
Don't worry.

836
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,280
It's like right here.

837
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,960
I see it.

838
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,400
It's like right over here.

839
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,220
My binoculars can see it.

840
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,580
Yeah, I do.

841
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,360
I have a gun.

842
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,200
Wait.

843
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,340
Okay, wait.

844
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,780
That's not it, but...

845
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,750
So he knows that I'm just a bird.

846
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,930
I have no idea what this thing I'm holding.

847
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:31,290
Okay.

848
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,010
It's this way.

849
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,170
Wait, those are... Wait, those are bear tracks.

850
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,490
What?

851
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,670
Where's the deer tracks?

852
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,610
I walked all the way here for more bear tracks?

853
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,310
All right, never mind.

854
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:45,750
See, I have a gun.

855
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,390
It's right here.

856
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,230
See, there's my gun.

857
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,910
It's gonna be so... Okay, he is trotting.

858
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,090
I can take him.

859
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,280
Okay.

860
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,300
It's time to get the squatter.

861
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:18,260
He thinks he can live in my nature reserve and not pay rent?

862
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,320
I bet... I bet he doesn't even have a passport here.

863
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,780
I bet he's from the... I bet he's from on the bad side of the Yukon.

864
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,640
The Canadian side.

865
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,920
But you're right, I need to wear something real quick.

866
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,840
Give me a sec.

867
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,460
You're right, I'm forgetting.

868
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,160
Guys, I'm just role-playing, okay?

869
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,960
I'm just role-playing.

870
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,500
I realize I should... I should be fully immersed.

871
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,500
All right, here we go.

872
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,840
Too real.

873
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,320
Too real.

874
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,220
A gun's a gun.

875
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,740
What do you mean?

876
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,500
I have a shotgun.

877
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,660
I need to have a different gun?

878
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,980
Is he following me?

879
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,660
Okay, he is.

880
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,440
Okay, he ran that way.

881
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,000
Where the fuck this guy...

882
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,060
Wait, but there's a deer here.

883
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,460
Wait.

884
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,380
Deers are... Wait, no.

885
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,360
Bears are slower.

886
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,580
Bears are actually slower though, so I'm gonna go for the bear.

887
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,580
All right.

888
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,660
He can't be that far.

889
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,500
He has to be.

890
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,520
Bears are slower than cariboos.

891
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,960
Cariboos run... Wait.

892
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:43,610
Oh.

893
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:45,650
Shh, there's a duck.

894
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:47,010
It's duck season.

895
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,730
Be very quiet.

896
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,890
It's duck season.

897
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,510
Hey, where is this duck?

898
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,250
Shh, be very, very quiet.

899
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:06,730
It's...

900
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:08,790
What if I shoot him with a fucking pistol?

901
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,230
Where is this duck?

902
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,310
I hear you.

903
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,020
I'm just like you.

904
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,240
I'm also a duck.

905
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,100
Look, see?

906
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:45,160
Okay, so the bear drinks here at a specific time.

907
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,620
You hear that?

908
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,560
You hear that, dad?

909
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,860
He drinks here at a specific time.

910
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,460
Okay, it's very old.

911
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,160
Wait, but what time does he drink here?

912
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,010
Drinking at four to eight.

913
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,150
Wait, what time is it?

914
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,870
Does my phone tell me what time it is?

915
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,150
Oh, okay, it's past four.

916
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:07,890
Oh, god damn it.

917
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,130
He was here an hour ago.

918
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,150
God damn it.

919
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,390
Okay.

920
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,470
All right, he's not here anymore.

921
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,990
Where the fuck is this bear?

922
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,590
Hello?

923
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,520
Where are you?

924
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,680
I think that's how bears... is that how bears sound like?

925
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,500
Is that... is that...

926
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,320
I think that's how bears sound like, right?

927
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,280
I lost the tracks though, by the way.

928
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,580
I don't know where the tracks are.

929
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,160
All right, maybe the tracks will appear again when I head to the story mission.

930
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,780
It's like 900 meters away.

931
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,620
It's not that far.

932
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,980
Maybe dad will find the bear.

933
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,420
Hello?

934
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,100
I haven't seen a single animal in this nature preserve.

935
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,280
Like, did we kill them all?

936
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,020
Like, where are you?

937
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,240
Not even like a fucking duck.

938
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:22,920
Okay.

939
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,020
I want to run, but I'm worried that I run and the bear was like next to me the whole time.

940
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,340
He like teleports behind me or some shit.

941
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,160
Wait, there's a question mark right here.

942
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,480
I don't make a lot of noise.

943
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,820
I'm literally walking!

944
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,600
I'm walking and there's... okay.

945
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,600
I'm making duck noises.

946
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,380
That's different.

947
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,960
I'm just like them.

948
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,260
I'm just like you!

949
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,640
I'm a duck!

950
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:57,550
All right.

951
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,110
Wait, human walking is also...

952
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,260
Oh, it's a red fox.

953
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,600
Okay, warning call.

954
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,460
What are you gonna warn me about, huh?

955
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,560
You think I'm scared of you?

956
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,260
Oh shit.

957
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,700
I need to buy wood?

958
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,120
Okay.

959
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,800
Okay, that is a gray wolf.

960
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,610
I heard a duck.

961
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,170
I heard a duck near me.

962
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,320
Hello, I'm just like you!

963
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,000
Quack, quack!

964
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,180
Quack, quack!

965
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Quack, quack!

966
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,020
Just like you!

967
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,120
Quack, quack, quack!

968
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,400
He ran that way.

969
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,290
Why are you all so scared?

970
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,570
I just... It's just me.

971
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,990
I'm just here to pay... I'm just here to get rent.

972
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,010
Guys, as long as you pay rent, you'll be fine.

973
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,030
There's nothing to worry about.

974
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,350
Little guys...

975
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,090
As long as you pay rent.

976
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,250
Bro, I don't fucking care.

977
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,090
I'm not hunting you.

978
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,710
Wait, this is a coyote?

979
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:25,930
I'm just like you!

980
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,690
I'm part of the dog family!

981
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:30,930
Okay, they were here.

982
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,350
There was a lot of them here.

983
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,860
Let me blow my nose real quick.

984
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,860
Guys, there's nothing to be afraid of!

985
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,620
If you pay your rent, you don't have to worry about me.

986
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,240
I'm just here to collect rent!

987
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,520
You think...

988
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,920
You think living in this nature preserve...

989
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,040
is for free?

990
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,580
Who's paying for all these trees, huh?

991
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,360
Who's paying for all your food?

992
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,300
Okay, he's right here somewhere.

993
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,520
Oh, there's a lot of them trotting around.

994
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,560
Wait, it's snowing.

995
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,340
Oh my god.

996
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,900
Okay, they must not have gone too far.

997
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,380
Yeah, and who pays taxes?

998
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,140
I'm trying.

999
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,080
Me and I'm trying really hard.

1000
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,620
I'm trying really hard to try and pay my taxes right now.

1001
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,840
I'm still waiting 15 days.

1002
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,320
Still waiting for those 15 days.

1003
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,900
To get my fucking letter.

1004
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,580
All right.

1005
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,780
I want to find- I want to see at least one thing.

1006
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:10,080
I just- I just want to see wha- The fuck is right there!

1007
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,660
God damn it!

1008
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,000
He looked at me!

1009
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:14,920
He saw me!

1010
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,800
It was so close!

1011
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,720
He blew the- no!

1012
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,840
It was right there!

1013
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,110
I was just walking around quacking!

1014
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,570
Oh my god.

1015
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,830
I saw him though, guys.

1016
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:35,490
I did see him.

1017
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,850
Not today, landlord.

1018
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,570
Oh my god.

1019
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:41,530
We got a runner.

1020
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,070
We got a runner.

1021
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,890
Dad, why didn't you say anything?

1022
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,730
I found- I found a guy who missed last month's friend and he ran.

1023
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:56,930
He knew.

1024
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,430
He knew what was gonna happen.

1025
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,570
He knew.

1026
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,390
What does my phone say?

1027
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:05,210
Okay, I'm trying to head- I'm gonna head to the wood lodge.

1028
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,070
We got a runner.

1029
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,050
I'm running.

1030
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:09,910
Fuck this.

1031
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:15,410
There's no way that like- I have any of them close to me.

1032
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,710
I refuse to believe that.

1033
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,180
They help you retrieve or track wounded animals?

1034
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,000
Why are they retrieving?

1035
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,860
What is he retrieving?

1036
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,920
I told him to retrieve and he tried to swim to Canada.

1037
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,860
Like, I don't know.

1038
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,860
Tux usually.

1039
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,120
Alright.

1040
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,740
He was retrieving the taxes.

1041
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,120
Alright.

1042
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,340
He wanted to retrieve Canada.

1043
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,520
Yep, that's my golden retriever right there.

1044
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,800
That's fine.

1045
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,500
There's no way the animals heard me running, right?

1046
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,080
I haven't seen- I saw only one animal and it was the moose.

1047
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,300
That ran away.

1048
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,670
That's fine.

1049
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:23,370
Oh.

1050
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:25,750
Oh.

1051
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,290
He's a hundred meters away.

1052
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,330
I'm heading over.

1053
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,670
I literally ran a little- Okay, guys.

1054
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,610
Be very quiet.

1055
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:37,290
Oh.

1056
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,130
Oh, it's right there.

1057
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:40,650
I see him.

1058
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:43,910
Guys, do you think he'll reach it?

1059
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,130
It's right there.

1060
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,710
It's right there.

1061
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,410
Oh my god, where did he go?

1062
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,090
Be very quiet.

1063
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,510
We're gonna hunt wolves now.

1064
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,230
I pivoted a lot, but this is the final pivot.

1065
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,050
I swear to god.

1066
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,510
They're like right there somewhere.

1067
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:03,510
Where are they?

1068
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:04,930
I lost them.

1069
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,510
I don't know how.

1070
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,990
They were literally right in front of me.

1071
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,030
They were literally right- Oh, there they are.

1072
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:17,350
Oh.

1073
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:19,910
Why are you barking?

1074
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:22,570
Okay.

1075
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,590
Very easy.

1076
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:25,610
Oh, he doesn't know.

1077
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:28,950
He doesn't know.

1078
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,590
Do you think they know?

1079
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,840
Wait, they're not running away.

1080
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,120
Wait.

1081
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,580
Oh shit, he wants to fight!

1082
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,680
Yeah, you wanna fight?

1083
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:42,680
Yeah?

1084
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,880
Yeah, that's fucking right!

1085
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,340
Oh shit!

1086
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,340
Oh!

1087
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,420
Oh wait, he's dead.

1088
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:51,780
Okay.

1089
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,540
Oh, it was just that easy.

1090
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,020
Okay, nice.

1091
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,280
I got a wolf.

1092
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,040
That's right, I got your alpha!

1093
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,500
What you gonna do now?

1094
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,700
That's fucking right!

1095
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,540
Oh, they got very hard?

1096
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,000
That's right!

1097
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,540
I got the alpha!

1098
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,660
I'm gonna taxiderm it.

1099
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,380
Okay, I can't.

1100
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,620
I'm broke as fuck.

1101
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:18,760
That's right!

1102
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,880
That's right!

1103
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:22,860
Run!

1104
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,420
You see that?

1105
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,380
You see that?

1106
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,920
Now retrieve it.

1107
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,180
Alright, what's the trophy rating?

1108
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:35,840
3236.

1109
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,380
Oh, did I got like- Oh my god, I got a gold trophy!

1110
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:39,940
Okay, harvest.

1111
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,920
Improper animal for this animal.

1112
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,580
Animal shot more than two times.

1113
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,420
Whoops, okay.

1114
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,120
Whoops, my bad.

1115
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:54,800
I have to have like proper fucking- Okay, how do I- What do I do?

1116
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,820
I ruined the gold?

1117
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,120
How do I make it- Look, I almost got gold though.

1118
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,180
I was two points away.

1119
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,700
Alright, I hit his flesh.

1120
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,120
Right humerus and right scapula.

1121
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,380
And then his intestines.

1122
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,900
Oh, I can't use a shotgun?

1123
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,460
But he was like right there.

1124
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,260
He was right in front of me.

1125
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,060
That's fucking right.

1126
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,800
You try to hunt me, I hunt you back.

1127
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,860
Alright, do I save harvest?

1128
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:22,940
Is that what I do?

1129
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:24,940
Inspect.

1130
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,160
I tore it up.

1131
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,580
Ooh, look at that.

1132
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,940
You can x-ray a trophy?

1133
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:31,880
Oh, wait.

1134
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,980
How do I x-ray it?

1135
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,000
I got silver though.

1136
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,650
Oh, right click?

1137
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:42,970
What does H do?

1138
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,640
Right click for x-ray?

1139
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,100
Whoops.

1140
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,620
Oh, okay.

1141
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,980
Oh, I shot him right here.

1142
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,820
Okay, I should've went like- Where's his heart?

1143
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,240
Oh, I almost got the heart.

1144
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,360
It was literally like if I shot like right here, it would be the heart.

1145
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,040
That was so close.

1146
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,880
I was literally that close to the heart.

1147
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,840
He was like so close to me!

1148
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,060
Okay.

1149
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,780
Wait, look for a green glow?

1150
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,920
There's a green glow?

1151
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,520
What does that mean?

1152
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,560
Wait, do I press H?

1153
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,520
To save harvest for it?

1154
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,470
Do I just press save harvest?

1155
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,890
Oh, I can see the...

1156
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:42,450
Oh, you know what?

1157
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,430
You know what?

1158
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:44,410
Okay, press enter.

1159
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:47,330
You know what?

1160
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:48,590
I'm not gonna taxiderm him.

1161
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:49,490
No, I should.

1162
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:50,470
Wait.

1163
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,490
Okay, I'll save harvest.

1164
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,610
Okay, there you go.

1165
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:57,650
My first wolf.

1166
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:00,570
When I can't afford you, I shall taxiderm you.

1167
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:02,350
Nice.

1168
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:03,530
Look at that!

1169
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,790
I got my first heart!

1170
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:06,690
Did you see that?

1171
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,630
Did you see that, dad?

1172
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,210
Did you see that?

1173
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,710
Now you know you have to pay rent.

1174
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,530
You think you're living in my house for free?

1175
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,630
Now you know.

1176
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:27,970
This is what happens when I have squatters living in my nature reserve.

1177
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,550
That's right!

1178
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:31,510
Your alpha is dead!

1179
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,010
Whoa!

1180
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,050
I think they all ran away.

1181
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:40,970
I'm pretty sure.

1182
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,960
What the fuck do you do to the squatters?

1183
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,580
I fucking taxiderm them.

1184
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,960
I say as a sane person.

1185
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,240
Oh wait, I killed another one.

1186
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,340
Wait, when did he die?

1187
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,880
When did I kill you?

1188
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,080
Wait, what the fuck?

1189
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,700
Wait, I got a lower rating?

1190
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,180
When did I kill this guy?

1191
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,400
Did he bleed out?

1192
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,260
Yeah, he has a lower difficulty.

1193
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,900
I got him without blood loss.

1194
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,200
Yeah, I know.

1195
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,420
I'm not doing anything with this one.

1196
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,240
This one's not worth it.

1197
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,540
This guy...

1198
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,340
Oh, is this the one I first shot?

1199
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,280
The one I didn't shotgun to death?

1200
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:29,720
It's surprising that the one I first shot has a lower rating.

1201
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,220
The AOE kill.

1202
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,260
Alright, the shock...

1203
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:42,960
I had more points with the shotgun for the one that had more...

1204
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,440
The one where I shotgunned.

1205
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,400
Oh, it's because he's not the alpha.

1206
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,700
Oh, he's just a regular guy.

1207
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,260
Proper ammo.

1208
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,740
Ammo shot two times or less.

1209
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,160
Intact trophy organs.

1210
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,140
Hit one.

1211
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,500
Yeah, I don't need you.

1212
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,520
Better money though.

1213
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,160
Really?

1214
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,240
But like...

1215
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,320
How do I get more money?

1216
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,260
Do I just like press enter and then I get more money from him?

1217
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,640
Oh, I just keep harvest?

1218
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,460
Just harvest him?

1219
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:22,780
Okay.

1220
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:28,090
Alright.

1221
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:29,730
Goodbye, wolf.

1222
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:31,930
Alright, now I can go back.

1223
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:33,730
Alright, see guys?

1224
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:35,170
I told you I can hunt.

1225
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,550
Look at that.

1226
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:42,050
Now I sent a message to all my nature reserve animals.

1227
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,710
Pay your rent or you are gonna get taxidermied.

1228
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,400
I have a friend.

1229
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,340
Okay.

1230
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:59,720
I don't know why, but like for some reason I have like multiple friends that are really into rat taxidermy.

1231
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,840
But like they don't do the taxidermy.

1232
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,540
Okay, have you guys ever seen like those little rat figures?

1233
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,260
The taxidermy rat figures?

1234
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,260
And they're in like these funny poses.

1235
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:17,940
So I have more than one friend that's like super into that and has like an actual like mini mini collection of them.

1236
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,500
And they're both artists.

1237
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,320
I don't know if that's like an artist thing.

1238
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,490
They like buy it from like Etsy sellers.

1239
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:41,310
No, have you ever seen those tax taxidermy rats on Etsy?

1240
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:46,490
Where they're like they like dress them up in like funny poses and scenarios.

1241
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:55,230
And you can like, and then I remember watching like cold ones and like you can commission them to like make like make OCs of yourself.

1242
01:03:55,430 --> 01:04:00,090
So you can make like technically make a Doki bird rat and like have them dressed up as me.

1243
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:10,950
I was watching cold ones and like they like they commissioned someone they commissioned one of those Etsy sellers to make one of them.

1244
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:12,090
That's kind...

1245
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:22,170
The most prized Doki shrine figure.

1246
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:24,770
A taxidermy Doki rat.

1247
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:30,270
Yeah, I'm here now.

1248
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,160
Yeah.

1249
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,760
I'm gonna keep the doors open.

1250
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,780
I want the bear to come in and grab me.

1251
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,080
I want a real fight.

1252
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,160
I was like no, the bear's gonna come.

1253
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,420
What the fuck is that bear gonna do?

1254
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,020
All I have in there are my guns.

1255
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:54,760
That's it.

1256
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,980
Like is he gonna come in there and fucking steal a gun and then shoot me?

1257
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,500
Like I like to see him try.

1258
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,980
Well, you aren't wrong.

1259
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,060
Some of us artists really like rats.

1260
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,580
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

1261
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,960
Thank you, thank you.

1262
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,360
Is he just gonna come into my house and sleep in my bed?

1263
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,460
That's good!

1264
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,180
It's easier for me to kill him.

1265
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,120
I'm gonna keep the door open.

1266
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,880
Oh, it'll pass time and restore my...

1267
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,380
Yeah, you know what?

1268
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,760
Oh, I need pay?

1269
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,960
How much is it?

1270
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,120
No, I don't need to pay.

1271
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,080
Fuck that.

1272
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,340
Alright.

1273
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,980
Oh, he's like guarding me.

1274
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:40,860
Oh, that's sweet.

1275
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,760
Alright, I have to...

1276
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,680
pick up a backpack.

1277
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,260
Oh, is the backpack inside the house?

1278
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,360
It's in here?

1279
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,240
Where's the backpack?

1280
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:58,840
Where is it?

1281
01:05:59,280 --> 01:05:59,760
Storage?

1282
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,060
Storage?

1283
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,120
The fuck is the backpack?

1284
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:08,890
Oh, the table?

1285
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:09,710
Oh, there it is.

1286
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:10,850
Sorry.

1287
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,990
I thought it was like a regular backpack.

1288
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:16,510
That just looks like a fanny pack.

1289
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,980
Alright, I'll go get to the fallen tree.

1290
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,290
I might as well just rent a B&B.

1291
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:46,010
If it's like $2.50 at this like...

1292
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,670
There's no heating here!

1293
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:52,070
Might as well go fucking find an Air B&B around this nature reserve.

1294
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:54,770
Guys...

1295
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:57,270
Although I'm the landlord, I don't pay rent.

1296
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,210
I make people pay my rent.

1297
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:01,890
I'm just gonna run.

1298
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:04,270
I don't think there's animals near me.

1299
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,950
I don't hear no warning call.

1300
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:08,910
I should be fine.

1301
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,930
There's no warning calls around me.

1302
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,620
Is there anything around here?

1303
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,060
Wait.

1304
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,160
No, that's just a tree.

1305
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:21,440
Alright.

1306
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:38,620
Okay.

1307
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,240
How do I know if it...

1308
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,280
No, it's my timeshare, guys.

1309
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,480
I pay...

1310
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,340
I own this property.

1311
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,160
This is my timeshare.

1312
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:11,180
This is my month, guys.

1313
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,240
For me to be here on this nature reserve.

1314
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,900
I pay...

1315
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,060
$800 a year.

1316
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,760
So I can come here...

1317
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,880
During my timeshare moments.

1318
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,740
So I come here...

1319
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,800
Once every five years.

1320
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:32,620
To do my hunting.

1321
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,440
Of squatters.

1322
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,260
Guys...

1323
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,440
You're spending your month...

1324
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,820
Marking trees.

1325
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,060
Did I mark it?

1326
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,600
Am I done?

1327
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,280
Mark trees near the infested area for investigation.

1328
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,320
Which trees?

1329
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,160
This one?

1330
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:48,680
This tree?

1331
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:50,960
Oh, yeah.

1332
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:51,540
This tree.

1333
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:51,880
Okay.

1334
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:07,760
Yeah, that's what timeshares are.

1335
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,260
You co-own the area.

1336
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,380
And you come over there once every five years.

1337
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,900
I thought it was quite...

1338
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:17,760
And I got like...

1339
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,280
A voucher and like...

1340
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,280
A free continental breakfast during the presentation.

1341
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,360
Wait.

1342
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,780
There was an animal crying at me.

1343
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,760
What a bargain.

1344
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,970
Thanks for taking care of this.

1345
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:47,110
It's becoming a full on phobia of mine.

1346
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:50,170
I'm using my timeshare to mark trees.

1347
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:04,770
Oh, nice.

1348
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:05,570
I got more money.

1349
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:07,590
Okay,

1350
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,300
that's good because I heard an animal right here too.

1351
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,920
Alright, yeah.

1352
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,560
No problem.

1353
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,640
Why is he so scared of them?

1354
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,160
Why is he so scared of them?

1355
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,220
Their music isn't that bad.

1356
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:47,920
And he just needs to wait five more years for the last one to die.

1357
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,960
They'll be gone forever.

1358
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:53,980
Okay.

1359
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:55,720
Very odd.

1360
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,080
Okay.

1361
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,580
Oh, it's a mating call.

1362
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:02,280
Oh, it killed a mother.

1363
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,860
That's ruined the special time.

1364
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,040
I'll give them a nice surprise.

1365
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:33,510
Where is he?

1366
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:38,590
Where is the mating?

1367
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:43,890
I'm getting my binoculars out for it.

1368
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,250
Where are you guys?

1369
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:53,370
I heard the call.

1370
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:08,590
Oh.

1371
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:12,250
Oh, there's the call.

1372
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:17,450
Don't worry.

1373
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:21,870
You're calling for somebody else to come over.

1374
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:29,310
Don't worry.

1375
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:32,430
I got my binoculars out for the special occasion.

1376
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:37,630
Alright.

1377
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:39,890
Let the pros score.

1378
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:41,730
I'm just, I'm just, you know.

1379
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,170
I'm gonna make sure they'll get it, you know.

1380
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,410
Alright, don't worry.

1381
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,630
I'll watch from an adequate distance away.

1382
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:56,190
Look, we need to populate.

1383
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,590
It's just like pandas, okay?

1384
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,010
I'm trying to make sure.

1385
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:06,270
I'm trying to make sure our nature reserve does not run out of out of foxes.

1386
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,730
Just creeping up.

1387
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:11,270
Very slowly.

1388
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,270
He can't run.

1389
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:13,770
He can't.

1390
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:14,770
Come on.

1391
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,490
He's gotta be close, right?

1392
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:20,800
Where is he?

1393
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,920
I'm slowly heading over.

1394
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:28,800
I know you're still trying to find it.

1395
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:30,280
Okay.

1396
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:33,460
Let's walk a little closer.

1397
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,800
Can't be that bad.

1398
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,730
Where is he?

1399
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,180
You see any of them?

1400
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,660
Oh, he's 110.

1401
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:54,100
Oh, he traveled further away.

1402
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,720
He hasn't found him yet.

1403
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:58,180
He hasn't found one yet.

1404
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,060
He's still looking.

1405
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,160
Someone please swipe.

1406
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,420
Was it right or left?

1407
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:03,600
I'm gonna die.

1408
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:11,360
Please, someone answer his call.

1409
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:13,280
He's desperate.

1410
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:19,540
Someone match him.

1411
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,280
Match his profile.

1412
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,220
Swipe right.

1413
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:26,680
He's desperate.

1414
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,340
He's been calling for 20 years.

1415
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:30,940
You up?

1416
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,840
He's like, you up?

1417
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,200
You up?

1418
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,360
Anyone?

1419
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,160
Where the fuck is he?

1420
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,620
Come on, call again.

1421
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,860
I don't see any of them.

1422
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,100
Come on.

1423
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,520
I brought these binoculars for nothing.

1424
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,020
No!

1425
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,820
Where did he go?

1426
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,300
He didn't even leave.

1427
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:08,830
Oh my god.

1428
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:09,590
He ran.

1429
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:14,490
Now I bought these binoculars for nothing.

1430
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:20,270
How was I supposed to know?

1431
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:21,690
I didn't even see him.

1432
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:25,270
Where could he have ran to?

1433
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,800
Where could he have even ran to?

1434
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:33,500
Okay.

1435
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,100
There's not even... Oh, there it is.

1436
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:48,740
Oh.

1437
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:53,800
Wait,

1438
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:58,700
not the wrong gun.

1439
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,700
Okay, do you think I can hit the shot?

1440
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:06,010
Wait, how do I make...

1441
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:06,210
Okay.

1442
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:13,430
Alright.

1443
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:14,690
Do you think I can hit the shot?

1444
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:31,310
Okay.

1445
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:35,670
Guys, do you think I hit him?

1446
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:37,770
Guys, do you think?

1447
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:39,930
Do you think I...

1448
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:40,630
I don't die!

1449
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:42,190
What is my win?!

1450
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:45,750
Guys, I don't think I hit him.

1451
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:47,470
I don't think.

1452
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:49,730
He like...

1453
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,550
He didn't even fucking move.

1454
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:52,570
I was like, did I do it?

1455
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:55,130
And he like lagged out or some shit.

1456
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,730
Nice, okay.

1457
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,450
Go look for blood, I guess.

1458
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,060
No, that's alright.

1459
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,480
I don't think there's blood anywhere.

1460
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,040
This doesn't seem like there's blood.

1461
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:21,850
I have to look at tree branches for win?

1462
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:24,990
I thought you were telling me.

1463
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,970
I thought it would be like a win meeting.

1464
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,270
I mean, it doesn't look like there's win.

1465
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:34,120
Alright.

1466
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,640
Well, I'm not going back for that caribou.

1467
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:37,940
That's fine.

1468
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:38,630
I'll go...

1469
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:39,850
Come on.

1470
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,010
Come on, dad.

1471
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,790
Let's go find a bear.

1472
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:47,250
Yeah, my heart rate was too high.

1473
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,810
I think I was shaking or some shit.

1474
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:51,890
I was most likely just running too much.

1475
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:53,270
Alright, let's go back.

1476
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:56,130
And there's bullet drops too.

1477
01:17:56,890 --> 01:17:58,350
I should've aimed it higher.

1478
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:00,470
That's fine.

1479
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:01,450
I'm so sad.

1480
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:04,630
I brought these binoculars, so...

1481
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:07,170
Damn it.

1482
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,090
He heard me?

1483
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,100
Why did he hear me?

1484
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,260
I'm so far away.

1485
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,680
I don't even know where he is.

1486
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,680
Alright, let's just go.

1487
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,220
That's fine if he heard me.

1488
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,020
Just run.

1489
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,260
Go and make more babies.

1490
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,720
I'll hunt your kids.

1491
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,100
You think I care?

1492
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,100
I'll just get your kids.

1493
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,860
No, it was another caribou.

1494
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,320
Can I see if there's any just roaming in the open plains?

1495
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,300
Oh, he went that way.

1496
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,580
Run, forest, run.

1497
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:50,980
I mean, at least I saw...

1498
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,280
I know he exists now.

1499
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,900
There's like so little animals here.

1500
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,340
I feel like...

1501
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,080
Is it us?

1502
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,820
Is it because of me?

1503
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,600
What a wild sentence.

1504
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,080
All I'm saying...

1505
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,300
Is that...

1506
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,260
Is that I'm patient.

1507
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,360
I can wait.

1508
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,780
Your kids might not be as fast as you.

1509
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:24,100
I'll just end your bloodline.

1510
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:33,170
Oh, he's mating too.

1511
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:34,410
There he is.

1512
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:34,750
There he is.

1513
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:38,410
Oh my god, I'm gonna...

1514
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:42,350
Okay, I got this.

1515
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,090
Did I get him?

1516
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:09,320
Guys, it says fleeing...

1517
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,440
But do you think I got him?

1518
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,180
I looked at bullet drops.

1519
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:21,960
But...

1520
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,400
But what about...

1521
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,500
How do I track him?

1522
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,860
Wait, how do you track him anyway?

1523
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:30,700
Okay.

1524
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,380
Because I looked at the...

1525
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,560
Oh, it's over here.

1526
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,440
The wind is so...

1527
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,340
I mean, it doesn't look like there's big wind.

1528
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,240
See?

1529
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,200
Look for blood?

1530
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:45,560
Okay.

1531
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,240
I'll go look.

1532
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,880
He can't run too far, right?

1533
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:51,700
Very old.

1534
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:52,680
God damn it.

1535
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,640
Someone's gotta clean this poop.

1536
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:58,330
I think that's him.

1537
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:04,250
I think that's him.

1538
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:06,310
Oh, he fled.

1539
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:07,610
God damn it, that was him.

1540
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:09,230
I didn't see him.

1541
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:11,530
Okay, I'm gonna track.

1542
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,710
Look for blood or footprints.

1543
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:15,630
Alright, I'm heading over.

1544
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,750
Oh, he ran that way.

1545
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:18,830
I'm coming back.

1546
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:22,390
I'm gonna end your bloodline right here.

1547
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,440
Did he go this way?

1548
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:28,400
Where did he go?

1549
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,900
I can't tell where he ran.

1550
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:31,400
Here?

1551
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,300
There's so many tracks.

1552
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,040
Which one's the right one?

1553
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,160
Okay, he ate here.

1554
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,620
He walked over here.

1555
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,760
And then he started eating.

1556
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,360
And then, where did he go?

1557
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:45,180
Here.

1558
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,660
That's where he fled to.

1559
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:49,780
Oh, there's ducks.

1560
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:54,060
Oh, I have skill points?

1561
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:57,580
Very fresh.

1562
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:58,740
Okay, he's somewhere here.

1563
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,580
He still wants to...

1564
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,020
Don't worry.

1565
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:04,680
He still wants to bang.

1566
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,100
Wait, where does it...

1567
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:08,860
It says nothing.

1568
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:12,620
Alright.

1569
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,560
Oh, it's over here.

1570
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,940
I'm gonna get you.

1571
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,000
Can't run away from me.

1572
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,180
Don't worry.

1573
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,400
I'm here to end your bloodline.

1574
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,120
Right here.

1575
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,460
The other ones.

1576
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,800
The other ones, I'll kill the children.

1577
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:38,180
You, I'll kill you now.

1578
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,440
I'm patient.

1579
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,440
I'm patient enough.

1580
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,170
Alright.

1581
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:47,630
He's just trotting?

1582
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:48,970
He's not even running.

1583
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:51,010
You smell him, dad?

1584
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:54,910
You smell him?

1585
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:56,870
Where is he?

1586
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,460
Okay, he's very...

1587
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,320
Bro, what the fuck?

1588
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,880
Stop pooping!

1589
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,740
You're ruining my environment!

1590
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,200
Alright, okay.

1591
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:12,560
So, like, apparently, dog poop is, like, really, really bad.

1592
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,060
For the environment.

1593
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:19,580
So, what's the difference between, like, dog poop and, like, deer poop, caribou poop?

1594
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:21,540
We, like, poop twice.

1595
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,140
Three times.

1596
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,820
Wait, very old?

1597
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,100
Wait a minute, am I not tracking the right...

1598
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:29,600
Same one?

1599
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:32,740
Oh, it's what we feed them.

1600
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:33,320
Okay.

1601
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,880
Like, is this the same...

1602
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,180
How many caribou lives here?

1603
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,720
Organic free range.

1604
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,320
Oh!

1605
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:53,630
Oh my god, there's a lot of them.

1606
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:55,890
Wait, okay, I'm pivoting, guys.

1607
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:58,450
Wait, unless...

1608
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,670
Unless the caribou is right here.

1609
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:02,670
Oh, so dogs can't, like, fertilize.

1610
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:03,410
Okay, never mind.

1611
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:04,730
You can poop as much as you want.

1612
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:06,990
Never mind.

1613
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,050
It's healthier.

1614
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:14,810
Oh, so dog poop is, like, toxic waste.

1615
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:15,290
Okay.

1616
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:17,030
I get it.

1617
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:18,230
Wait, is that him?

1618
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:20,610
I saw him right over...

1619
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:20,950
No.

1620
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:21,870
Wait, is that?

1621
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:23,570
I can't tell.

1622
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:27,550
I'm just following a bunch of fucking poop and prints.

1623
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:29,790
Oh, I see him.

1624
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:31,290
I see him, he's right over there.

1625
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:32,730
I see him.

1626
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:33,790
I see him.

1627
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:37,990
He's right there.

1628
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:39,870
Where's my binoculars?

1629
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:44,740
Which one is it?

1630
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,640
Oh, there he is.

1631
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:51,320
Okay.

1632
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,260
He doesn't know.

1633
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,420
Okay, I can do this.

1634
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:56,160
Shh.

1635
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:04,340
Okay.

1636
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,120
Alright.

1637
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:20,250
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1638
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:22,930
Let's go, let's go!

1639
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,000
Oh!

1640
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,880
Oh, fuck!

1641
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,100
That was a shot!

1642
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,940
Wait, where did I hit him?

1643
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:35,620
Where did I hit him?

1644
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:36,600
Where did I hit him?

1645
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,400
Let's fucking go!

1646
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,900
I told you!

1647
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,940
I'll end your fucking bloodline!

1648
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,340
I'll end your fucking bloodline!

1649
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:47,920
Okay.

1650
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,700
You're fine.

1651
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,020
The blood.

1652
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,980
Where's the blood?

1653
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,040
Where's the blood?

1654
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,340
Just now.

1655
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:07,770
Oh!

1656
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,140
Oh, I see the blood!

1657
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:14,000
I'm coming for you!

1658
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,940
You're fucking pooping your skin!

1659
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,080
You can't run forever!

1660
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,820
The more you run, the more blood you lose!

1661
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,400
Just keep running!

1662
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,500
Keep running!

1663
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:40,220
Okay.

1664
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:41,520
Okay.

1665
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,980
Where are you?

1666
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:44,920
Oh, wait.

1667
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,920
Blood rate very low.

1668
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,480
God damn it.

1669
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:51,480
Okay, we're just gonna look.

1670
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,420
He's like somewhere here.

1671
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,860
He's fleeing.

1672
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:07,470
Okay, it's right here.

1673
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:08,790
Okay.

1674
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:08,970
Okay.

1675
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:11,830
I'm gonna stop running.

1676
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:14,390
Blood rate very low.

1677
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:15,650
He's somewhere here.

1678
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:19,150
I know you're here, little guy.

1679
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:23,650
I know you're here.

1680
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:24,710
You're still bleeding.

1681
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,170
You're still bleeding.

1682
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,150
Where are you?

1683
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:36,910
It looks like you're still bleeding.

1684
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:39,930
Oh.

1685
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:42,910
Where are you?

1686
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:46,790
Where are you?

1687
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,210
Wait, that's not what I wanted.

1688
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:50,290
Where the fuck is the blood?

1689
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:52,690
Oh, look.

1690
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:54,210
There's more blood.

1691
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,690
Oh, you can't bleed forever.

1692
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:02,930
Alright, it's over here.

1693
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,610
Don't worry, I'm still following.

1694
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:08,870
I'm still following.

1695
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:12,030
Where did you run to?

1696
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:15,850
I'll always find you.

1697
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:18,010
Wait.

1698
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:21,290
Where did the track go?

1699
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:24,490
Oh, it's over here.

1700
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:25,310
It's over here.

1701
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:26,710
I was like, wait a minute.

1702
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:28,810
Wait a minute, the track stopped.

1703
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:30,530
Don't worry.

1704
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:33,330
I can still find you.

1705
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:34,470
Oh, you're gone now.

1706
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:36,750
Oh, very fresh.

1707
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:38,090
Oh.

1708
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:40,730
Don't worry, I see your tracks.

1709
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:43,210
I see it.

1710
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:58,040
Let me just slowly walk up to you.

1711
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:16,980
Where is he?

1712
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,620
He's here somewhere.

1713
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:24,140
He's here.

1714
01:29:31,550 --> 01:29:32,850
Goddammit, that's him!

1715
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:36,750
That's him, that's him too.

1716
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:38,370
Goddammit!

1717
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:39,790
Alright, don't worry.

1718
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:44,410
Don't worry, I'm still gonna... You think you can run?

1719
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:46,290
You think you can run?

1720
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:47,090
You're lucky.

1721
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:52,090
You're so lucky that you saw me there, but you're still bleeding.

1722
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:55,650
You'll eventually lose too much blood.

1723
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:00,890
You can keep running.

1724
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:05,450
You'll eventually lose too much and you gotta slow down.

1725
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:11,430
Can't run that far from me.

1726
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:16,010
Don't worry, I still got your trail.

1727
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:17,990
I still got it.

1728
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:19,930
Alright, how do you lay down?

1729
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:21,330
I only know how to crouch.

1730
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:30,930
I hear you.

1731
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:34,010
I know you're here somewhere.

1732
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,250
I hear you.

1733
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:38,230
I hear you.

1734
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:41,010
Oh, I know you're here.

1735
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:43,710
I heard you trotting along.

1736
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:45,450
Think you're safe?

1737
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:48,090
You think you're safe, little guy?

1738
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,130
Oh, you're so bleeding.

1739
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,010
Don't worry.

1740
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:55,710
One day, you're gonna lose all your blood.

1741
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:57,730
It's alright.

1742
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:05,310
Don't worry, I'm here to end your suffering.

1743
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:13,990
Oh, you just ran?

1744
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:16,170
Just gonna keep running?

1745
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,950
You're just gonna keep running?

1746
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:24,330
Where did these tracks go?

1747
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:31,310
Okay, he walked back and then he walked back and forth.

1748
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:33,470
Fuck, okay, wait.

1749
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:34,970
Oh, it's in front of me, okay.

1750
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,470
There's more blood here.

1751
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:44,570
He thinks he can get away, but I'm patient.

1752
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:46,010
I'm very patient.

1753
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,950
I have the adrenaline running in.

1754
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:49,790
I hit that first shot.

1755
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:51,850
I hit that shot.

1756
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,830
And then...

1757
01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:55,510
And now I'm never leaving.

1758
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:58,530
I'm never leaving you.

1759
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:00,010
You think I'll...

1760
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,570
You think I'm gonna give up now?

1761
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:04,890
Oh, I hit that first shot, little guy.

1762
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,650
I hit that first shot, I'm never leaving.

1763
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:10,190
I'm making sure you're going...

1764
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:11,410
You're gonna be nice.

1765
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:16,610
You're gonna be a nice display in my home before the bears get you.

1766
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:23,200
Got a family to feed.

1767
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,740
Oh, you're trotting back and forth trying to lose me?

1768
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,240
Oh, I know you're just walking over here.

1769
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,080
Fuck, he saw me.

1770
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,300
There he is.

1771
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,220
I see you.

1772
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,880
Oh, I know where you are.

1773
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,800
You're gonna keep running?

1774
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,540
Oh, you're gonna keep running?

1775
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,320
That's cute.

1776
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:52,520
That's so cute.

1777
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:58,010
I know you went this way.

1778
01:32:58,590 --> 01:33:00,090
I saw where you ran.

1779
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:02,850
I saw where you ran.

1780
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:09,870
Wait.

1781
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:11,890
Wait a minute.

1782
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:14,730
Oh, he's smart.

1783
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:17,650
He's smart.

1784
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:20,490
He's very smart.

1785
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:22,570
Wait.

1786
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:25,930
Oh, these tracks.

1787
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:28,530
He went that way?

1788
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:31,470
But then he went backwards.

1789
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:34,150
Wait.

1790
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:36,450
Wait, I lost the tracks.

1791
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:37,350
Guys.

1792
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:39,650
I actually...

1793
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:41,030
Wait.

1794
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:42,410
Wait a minute.

1795
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:44,510
Guys, we have a problem now.

1796
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:45,710
Wait.

1797
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:48,710
He actually...

1798
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:50,650
Wait, I think he juked me, guys.

1799
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:53,330
He went up the trees.

1800
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:54,870
Wait a minute.

1801
01:33:55,270 --> 01:34:02,250
Guys, he might have actually... Like, he went that way, and then he like... Where did he go?

1802
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:04,510
Where did he...

1803
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:06,430
Wait.

1804
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:08,430
Wait, the fuck is this?

1805
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:10,170
Bro,

1806
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:17,590
the tracks stopped there.

1807
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:20,090
That doesn't make sense.

1808
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,430
Wait, the tracks actually stopped.

1809
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:25,790
Where did it go?

1810
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:27,650
Wait.

1811
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,710
Where did it go?

1812
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:31,650
Left?

1813
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:32,270
This side?

1814
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:35,820
Okay.

1815
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,280
We're checking the map.

1816
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:40,760
Look, it actually stopped right here.

1817
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,700
It disappeared.

1818
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,640
He walked this way.

1819
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,500
And then he walked that way.

1820
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:52,460
And then he walked back here.

1821
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,760
Wait a minute.

1822
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,200
All the tracks stopped.

1823
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,120
Look.

1824
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:04,880
I don't know.

1825
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,940
Okay, I might need you to...

1826
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:11,720
I might need a track for me.

1827
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:12,700
I don't know, man.

1828
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,640
He's not Bloodhound, so I don't know.

1829
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,700
He grew wings and flew.

1830
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,300
Like, where did he go?

1831
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:30,380
He actually disappeared.

1832
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,340
There's no more blue tracks anywhere.

1833
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:37,830
How did he juke me?

1834
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:43,900
He actually juked me.

1835
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,380
This fucker.

1836
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:48,040
Oh my God.

1837
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,180
I can't believe it.

1838
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,160
That was such a good shot, too.

1839
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,480
He actually got away.

1840
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,640
He actually got away.

1841
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,540
I can't fucking believe it.

1842
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,180
Oh my God, I'm so sad.

1843
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,500
I worked so hard tracking this, too.

1844
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,500
Did he walk backwards?

1845
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:13,060
There's no way he walked...

1846
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:13,940
No, he didn't!

1847
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:18,440
See, he walked forward here, and then, like, the blood splatter's here.

1848
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:23,180
You know what?

1849
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:23,900
I'm gonna kill a bear.

1850
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:26,820
Kill a bear.

1851
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:36,880
Where is he?

1852
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:38,960
Oh, he's over there.

1853
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:48,250
Alright.

1854
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:50,530
I'm gonna kill a bear instead, I guess.

1855
01:36:58,490 --> 01:36:59,310
Yeah, fuck it.

1856
01:36:59,310 --> 01:36:59,810
I don't care.

1857
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:01,690
Wait, it's two bears.

1858
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:05,650
I don't think I hit it.

1859
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:09,190
Leveled up.

1860
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:10,550
It's fine.

1861
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:12,130
I'm mad.

1862
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:12,990
I'm just mad.

1863
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:16,250
I can't believe he actually got away.

1864
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:19,070
Oh my God, I'm so mad.

1865
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:22,390
I can't believe he successfully got away.

1866
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:26,410
Oh, I was so into this hunt, too.

1867
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:29,770
Oh, the bear family.

1868
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:32,690
Like, he literally his tracks disappeared.

1869
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:36,030
Like, there's no other tracks, too.

1870
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:38,310
He actually juked me.

1871
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:43,130
This fucking stupid-ass deer successfully got away.

1872
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:48,630
I worked so fucking... Like, there's no more blue tracks anywhere.

1873
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:51,010
There's no more.

1874
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:54,210
The tracks stopped.

1875
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:56,090
Like, how is that possible?

1876
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:57,850
How is...

1877
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,970
How is... It's gone!

1878
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:04,170
It's actually gone!

1879
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:05,330
Like...

1880
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:09,950
Successfully evaded taxes.

1881
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,490
Like, where did it go?

1882
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:18,210
Smart deer.

1883
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:19,930
I'm so sad.

1884
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:21,590
I was such a good shot, too.

1885
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:25,430
I can't believe it.

1886
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:28,530
There's no more blue anywhere.

1887
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:34,670
Like, it climbed up a tree?

1888
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:37,050
Clever deer.

1889
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:42,510
A Christmas miracle happened today, guys.

1890
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:46,390
The second caribou fucking grew wings and flew off.

1891
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:53,350
He lived another day.

1892
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:55,230
I can't believe.

1893
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:57,670
I can't believe he actually lived, dad.

1894
01:38:58,630 --> 01:39:00,930
I can't fucking believe it.

1895
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:05,610
He learned how to climb a tree.

1896
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:08,690
I knew reindeers could fly.

1897
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:15,730
I don't... I don't understand!

1898
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:17,850
Wait, is that his tracks?

1899
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:19,070
Oh my god.

1900
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:21,610
Wait.

1901
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:23,330
Wait a minute.

1902
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:25,110
Wait a minute.

1903
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:26,150
I found you.

1904
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:28,690
I found you in the end.

1905
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:30,410
Oh my god.

1906
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:31,690
Wait a minute.

1907
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:32,990
I found you.

1908
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:34,270
I found you.

1909
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:37,350
We're back, boys.

1910
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:39,710
We're looking back.

1911
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:41,370
Oh my god.

1912
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:43,190
He knows it's feeding time.

1913
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,050
Okay, give me a sec.

1914
01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:45,650
I gotta feed him.

1915
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:49,090
Okay.

1916
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:49,330
Okay.

1917
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,080
Okay.

1918
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:15,900
Alright, we're gonna kill this fucking deer if it's the last thing I do.

1919
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,020
This is my entire...

1920
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:23,960
I swear to god.

1921
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:31,120
I swear to god, I need this deer dead.

1922
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:34,240
Everything I've been through.

1923
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,080
Okay, where did the tracks go?

1924
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:40,320
Wait.

1925
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:43,300
Where did the tracks go after that?

1926
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:48,210
Wait, the tracks are gone again.

1927
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:50,570
What the fuck?

1928
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:55,070
How did the tracks disappear again?

1929
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,720
Oh my god.

1930
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:01,700
This is a new deer.

1931
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:04,140
This is not even the same deer.

1932
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:10,230
This is a different deer.

1933
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,070
Oh my god.

1934
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:15,530
I'll never find this stupid ass deer.

1935
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,210
Oh wait, it's fresh poop.

1936
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:20,590
I'll never find this stupid fucking deer.

1937
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:28,330
Okay, but this is fresh poop though.

1938
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,520
Okay, this is a resting zone.

1939
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:34,960
Okay.

1940
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:36,980
That's good to know.

1941
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:40,060
Is there anybody sipping water?

1942
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,100
There's no water sippers here.

1943
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,580
Okay, no water sippers.

1944
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,900
Oh my god, there was a deer here.

1945
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:59,280
But like, I don't see any animals around me.

1946
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,160
There's nobody vocalizing.

1947
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:09,200
God damn it.

1948
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:11,660
God fucking damn it.

1949
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:12,860
We were so close.

1950
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:14,940
It disappeared.

1951
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,140
He actually like grew wings or something.

1952
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:19,720
He fucking climbed a tree.

1953
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:20,440
I don't know.

1954
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,620
He climbed a tree and flew away.

1955
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:25,660
The stupid fucking deer.

1956
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:30,120
The deer friends will never... He drank Red Bull.

1957
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:35,230
Maybe there's some of them in the water.

1958
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:38,610
No, but his tracks disappeared.

1959
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:46,670
How do I...

1960
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,330
How do I spend my skill point?

1961
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:50,270
Oh, there it is.

1962
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:50,630
Okay.

1963
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:52,950
I have zero skill point.

1964
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:54,130
Okay.

1965
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:56,510
I don't even have skill point.

1966
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:59,170
I can't believe it.

1967
01:42:59,230 --> 01:43:00,750
He lived to tell the tale.

1968
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:05,370
Now all his deer friends are gonna think he's so cool.

1969
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,230
I can't fucking believe it.

1970
01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:12,190
I have one?

1971
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:13,490
Wait, do I?

1972
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:16,090
Oh, I do.

1973
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:16,490
Okay.

1974
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:25,850
Alright, we wanna... I have to... Okay, I have to buy this.

1975
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:28,430
Alright, now I'm a better tracker.

1976
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:31,990
I got this gunshot in the war.

1977
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:36,070
Got to go here.

1978
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:38,650
There's like nothing around me.

1979
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:41,570
Why does no one wanna be in the open?

1980
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:44,810
Wait, there's new deer.

1981
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:47,090
What is this?

1982
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:50,170
There's new deer.

1983
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:52,830
Alright, new target.

1984
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:54,570
New target.

1985
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:59,690
I'll grab this new deer if it's the... I will kill a deer.

1986
01:44:00,930 --> 01:44:03,990
I will end somebody's bloodline today.

1987
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:04,530
Okay?

1988
01:44:06,450 --> 01:44:08,750
Somebody's bloodline has to end.

1989
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:12,010
If it's the last thing I do.

1990
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:16,030
I'm going to create Bambi.

1991
01:44:16,170 --> 01:44:16,530
I...

1992
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:19,290
I need to make sure Bambi happens guys.

1993
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:25,690
Alright, this way.

1994
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:30,570
Okay, there's a deer over there.

1995
01:44:30,990 --> 01:44:32,870
I'm falling deer.

1996
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:34,350
The wolves don't count.

1997
01:44:35,550 --> 01:44:38,790
I wanna make sure Bambi becomes canon.

1998
01:44:41,230 --> 01:44:43,790
Walked here, but...

1999
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:44,930
Oh, there's another tracks here.

2000
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:50,630
Alright, we go this way.

2001
01:44:51,710 --> 01:44:53,810
I don't think we're killing a bear, guys.

2002
01:44:56,830 --> 01:44:59,170
I don't think we're getting any bear kills.

2003
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:00,590
I don't understand.

2004
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:02,510
They're clearly here in the open.

2005
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:05,790
They were, but now they're not.

2006
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:09,450
Poop ends here.

2007
01:45:11,790 --> 01:45:13,650
Why does the poop end here?

2008
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:16,110
Did he fucking fly too?

2009
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:18,870
Oh no, it's over there.

2010
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:22,390
Okay, I was gonna say, where the fuck did the rest of them go?

2011
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:26,490
Alright, I figured it out.

2012
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,490
I'm also gonna grab a water sample too.

2013
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:34,070
Oh, it's not this water.

2014
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:36,710
Okay, there's more poop here.

2015
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:40,110
Jesus Christ, they poop like every 10 seconds.

2016
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:43,910
They have too much fiber in their diets.

2017
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:47,010
Wait, the poop... Oh no, the poop doesn't end here.

2018
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:53,110
What happens if I walk into the lake?

2019
01:45:53,290 --> 01:45:53,470
Huh?

2020
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:57,130
Dad walked into the lake and he's fine.

2021
01:45:57,410 --> 01:45:58,070
Look at him.

2022
01:45:58,830 --> 01:46:00,930
He doesn't do much for me, but he's fine.

2023
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:05,120
Alright.

2024
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:09,760
More poop.

2025
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:12,700
Wait, the poop trail end.

2026
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:15,160
Wait, the poop trail ended.

2027
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:16,620
Wait a minute.

2028
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,020
Wait a minute.

2029
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:19,240
Wait a minute.

2030
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:26,680
I swear to fucking oh my...

2031
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:34,260
I walked back because the poop trail ended and then he runs away.

2032
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:35,900
Like, I don't understand.

2033
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:38,500
His poop trail ended.

2034
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,880
There's nothing left.

2035
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,320
There's nothing.

2036
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:44,580
There's nothing.

2037
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:46,440
His other tracker's gone.

2038
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:49,100
How many deer's are here?

2039
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:51,640
Okay.

2040
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:53,960
Alright, fuck this.

2041
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:54,940
Fuck this.

2042
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,200
I'm going to my other quest.

2043
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:57,740
Fuck these deer's.

2044
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:58,680
I'll kill another deer.

2045
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,360
There's plenty of deer's around here.

2046
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:05,080
These deer's are...

2047
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:08,500
These deer's are... Anyway, fuck this.

2048
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,700
Another deer will show up and they'll be over.

2049
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:14,680
I believe.

2050
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:17,160
It doesn't matter.

2051
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,380
A deer will eventually show his face around here.

2052
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:25,940
There's plenty of deer's in the sea for me to hunt.

2053
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:33,880
Alright, let's see.

2054
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,400
Okay, we gotta grab water here.

2055
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:40,080
Are there any secret deer's hiding here?

2056
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:46,060
Does no one want to drink a water in this beautiful lake?

2057
01:47:51,790 --> 01:47:53,670
Alright, I got my water sample.

2058
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:02,060
Oh my god, don't worry.

2059
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:04,080
I know where there's plenty of animal shit.

2060
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:10,620
Don't worry!

2061
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:14,580
I have plenty of poop for you to fucking examine.

2062
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,320
Wait, I'm a bit lost.

2063
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,480
Where am I?

2064
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:23,540
Where am I?

2065
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:25,820
I don't even know where I am anymore.

2066
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:29,420
I don't even know.

2067
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:34,330
Like, where am I?

2068
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:34,450
What is that?

2069
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:39,010
There's not even tracks anywhere.

2070
01:48:41,150 --> 01:48:42,670
I'm so lost.

2071
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:45,730
How do they know I'm here?

2072
01:48:46,150 --> 01:48:47,730
I'm a deer country.

2073
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:53,210
Wait, how is there no more poop?

2074
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:56,230
There's so many poop and now there's no more?

2075
01:48:56,590 --> 01:48:58,270
Where the fuck did they all go?

2076
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:02,170
What happened to the caribou population?

2077
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:09,240
They moved out?

2078
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:14,260
How did the entire population of caribou just disappear?

2079
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:18,020
Like, did they like mine themselves out?

2080
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:23,720
Oh my god, it's like the Mayans.

2081
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,320
The greatest mystery of all time.

2082
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:27,640
There's some poop.

2083
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,940
They all got ratchet.

2084
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:34,280
Here, I got it.

2085
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:49,090
Alright.

2086
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:52,650
I'm tracking like four different caribou poops apparently.

2087
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:57,870
Oh my god.

2088
01:49:58,470 --> 01:50:01,010
Like, I don't understand why all these things just disappear.

2089
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:04,010
There's more tracks here.

2090
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:09,850
I always hear ducks but like, where are these ducks?

2091
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:19,710
Oh my god, they were above me this entire time.

2092
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:20,230
Watch this.

2093
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,740
Oh, hit the shot.

2094
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:37,860
Okay, but would it be wild if I could actually hit that?

2095
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:40,260
Like, wouldn't that be fucking wild though?

2096
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,020
It was worth the try.

2097
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:49,840
But it would be so cool if I hit them!

2098
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:59,300
Guys, it would have looked so fucking cool if I did hit that shot.

2099
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:05,320
It's just up top.

2100
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:08,780
Don't they have to come down and like, you know...

2101
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,640
Like, drink water?

2102
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:19,410
I lost the tracks.

2103
01:51:20,210 --> 01:51:24,610
There's like so much poop but yet like, zero fucking caribou.

2104
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:41,720
Okay, eventually I'll hit that shot and it'll be so cool.

2105
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:41,980
Oh boy.

2106
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:50,620
Okay, but when I do hit that shot, guys...

2107
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,140
It would happen, guys.

2108
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:56,620
It would happen and it would look so fucking cool.

2109
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:06,800
And then you guys would clip it and it'll go viral and be like, oh my god, VTuber hits the nastiest shot of her life.

2110
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:08,100
Guys...

2111
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,920
There's like nothing over here.

2112
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:12,920
Alright, let's head...

2113
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:15,920
Let's head back to Lumber Shore.

2114
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:17,060
Wait, where's home?

2115
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:18,720
Where is home?

2116
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:22,300
Oh my god, I traveled so fucking far.

2117
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:27,020
The shot that ended the hunt, exactly.

2118
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,880
God, can it stop snowing in Alaska?

2119
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:33,960
Oh my god.

2120
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:36,940
Oh, wait.

2121
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:40,640
I thought I saw something move.

2122
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:43,740
Something not move over there?

2123
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:50,990
I'm going crazy.

2124
01:52:51,790 --> 01:52:53,450
This hunt is making me go crazy.

2125
01:52:53,890 --> 01:52:56,990
I swear to god, I thought I saw something move over there.

2126
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:58,350
Oh my...

2127
01:52:58,350 --> 01:52:59,670
I'm not okay anymore.

2128
01:53:00,090 --> 01:53:00,570
I'm...

2129
01:53:00,570 --> 01:53:02,650
I'm losing it.

2130
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:07,190
I'm losing it, guys.

2131
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:12,350
Ever since that deer that fucking flew away, I can't...

2132
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:14,210
I don't know where I am anymore.

2133
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:18,370
I...

2134
01:53:19,290 --> 01:53:20,830
Mental, thank you for the superchat.

2135
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:21,590
Thank you, thank you.

2136
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:23,430
Nice to see more creators playing this game.

2137
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:24,570
Oh, wait, wait.

2138
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,500
Oh, he's close.

2139
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,160
Don't worry, I got the shotgun.

2140
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:40,220
Oh, he's gonna start making babies.

2141
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:43,940
Where are you?

2142
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:46,300
Baby makers.

2143
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:58,200
It would be so cool if I hit the shot, though.

2144
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,600
Guys, I know that...

2145
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:11,980
It would be so cool if I hit the shot, though, guys.

2146
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:17,300
Okay.

2147
01:54:20,450 --> 01:54:22,110
Alright, let me get closer.

2148
01:54:22,530 --> 01:54:23,350
Let me get closer.

2149
01:54:23,710 --> 01:54:28,810
He won't know.

2150
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,240
Is this close enough, guys?

2151
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:39,660
Here's the win.

2152
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:52,120
No, no, no!

2153
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:57,840
No!

2154
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,480
Guys, do you think I hit it?

2155
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:04,980
Guys, do you think I hit the shot?

2156
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:07,740
Do you think I hit it?

2157
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:09,660
It'd be so cool if I did here.

2158
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:15,220
No, but it'd be so cool though!

2159
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:22,500
Guys, guys, look.

2160
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:25,100
I know, but it'd be so cool if...

2161
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:37,960
Look, it would have been really cool if it did work out.

2162
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:45,540
Guys, it's all about the gamble.

2163
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:50,200
It's all about the gamble, alright?

2164
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:53,760
We're here to make flashy plays, yeah, alright?

2165
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:55,640
We're here to be flashy.

2166
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,500
Okay, but if the rifle hits that bird...

2167
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:06,540
Hits a bird in a piercing shot, it would have been so fucking cool.

2168
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:11,440
It's the thrill, guys.

2169
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:12,620
It's the thrill.

2170
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:16,960
I'm not throwing.

2171
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,540
I'm just trying to make a cool shot.

2172
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:21,060
That's different.

2173
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,320
It's different, guys.

2174
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:24,740
Oh, wait.

2175
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,640
It has to fall down, right?

2176
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:33,570
What comes up, must come down.

2177
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:39,990
Come on.

2178
01:56:40,190 --> 01:56:43,810
What comes up, must come down.

2179
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:52,270
Okay, but if I did hit that shot, it would have been so fucking cool.

2180
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:53,610
And you know it.

2181
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:57,630
Yeah, they're traveling.

2182
01:56:58,130 --> 01:56:59,130
Where are they traveling to?

2183
01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:01,510
Where are you guys flying to?

2184
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:04,010
You have to come down sooner or later.

2185
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:07,230
You guys stay up there forever.

2186
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:08,550
Wait, what is that?

2187
01:57:08,710 --> 01:57:09,530
Oh, no, that's nothing.

2188
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:12,110
I'm just seeing things now.

2189
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:14,650
I'm just seeing things.

2190
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:16,770
I'm never gonna find another deer.

2191
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:19,630
They're going back to Canada.

2192
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:26,770
Alright, we go this way.

2193
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:32,450
Alright, we go this way.

2194
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:34,590
There has to be.

2195
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:39,780
There has to be another deer somewhere.

2196
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:42,040
There has to be.

2197
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,280
I will fucking kill.

2198
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:47,500
I need to end somebody's bloodline.

2199
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:49,820
Come on.

2200
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:54,760
How can I end a bloodline if they don't show up?

2201
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:59,280
I send letters and everything.

2202
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:03,160
I'll be like, come here if you want your bloodline ended.

2203
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:04,580
Free of charge.

2204
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:09,640
There's not even tracks anywhere.

2205
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:11,940
I've lost all tracks.

2206
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:16,920
Do you think they heard my gunshots?

2207
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,180
Could it be all the gunshots I've been shooting?

2208
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:25,700
All the shots I've been shooting from my rifle?

2209
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:27,920
Do you think it's that, guys?

2210
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:35,380
Please, I have a family to feed.

2211
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:38,660
My dragoons are gonna starve.

2212
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:39,120
Whoops.

2213
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:50,100
Don't worry.

2214
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:55,760
I'm coming over very slowly.

2215
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:01,470
I hear him.

2216
01:59:02,730 --> 01:59:04,790
Don't worry, I'm here to feed you guys.

2217
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:08,590
I hear him.

2218
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,180
There he is.

2219
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:18,280
I don't know where he is, but there he is.

2220
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:22,890
He...

2221
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:28,990
I'm very slowly getting there.

2222
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:30,330
Guys, please.

2223
01:59:30,490 --> 01:59:32,050
You can start for five more minutes.

2224
01:59:32,210 --> 01:59:35,510
If you can start for like an hour, you can start for five more minutes.

2225
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:35,990
I...

2226
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:41,950
Wait,

2227
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:55,820
the bullets are not effect... Why did you tell me there's wind and bullet drop?

2228
01:59:56,340 --> 02:00:00,260
I was literally aiming intentionally for like bullet drop and wind.

2229
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:11,810
Oh my god.

2230
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:14,850
I can't believe... Oh my god.

2231
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:28,830
I literally... I was literally aiming intentionally as if there was a bullet drop and oh my god.

2232
02:00:28,950 --> 02:00:31,110
I can't believe it.

2233
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:45,320
Wait, where did the moose go?

2234
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:54,400
Oh my god, your wife's gonna call me now?

2235
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:02,290
Hey there, this is Sani.

2236
02:01:03,690 --> 02:01:08,070
Can you take the shot and send it to me?

2237
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:10,950
No.

2238
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:22,190
Wait, the moose is gone.

2239
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:36,390
Where did the moose go?

2240
02:01:40,030 --> 02:01:42,090
Where the fuck did the moose go?

2241
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:44,830
Oh my god.

2242
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:46,870
Okay, I shouldn't have fucking crawled.

2243
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:47,710
I should've just walked.

2244
02:01:48,430 --> 02:01:50,410
The moose disappeared.

2245
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:55,050
Oh my god.

2246
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:56,810
Are you fucking kidding me?

2247
02:01:57,830 --> 02:01:59,070
The moose fucking disappeared.

2248
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:02,150
The moose also disappeared.

2249
02:02:02,310 --> 02:02:03,850
Oh my god, they all just keep disappearing.

2250
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:04,990
They all...

2251
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:17,690
He's over here somewhere.

2252
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:32,250
Where is he?

2253
02:02:37,230 --> 02:02:39,110
Bro, okay, lay down.

2254
02:02:40,450 --> 02:02:41,430
Lay down.

2255
02:02:41,550 --> 02:02:42,950
He's like, what are you doing?

2256
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:45,650
Bro, apparently you gotta lay down.

2257
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:50,000
Okay.

2258
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:53,280
Okay, be very quiet.

2259
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:54,480
We're hunting moose now.

2260
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:59,620
He's just like, what are you doing?

2261
02:03:00,100 --> 02:03:02,560
I'm trying to find the fucking moose.

2262
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:13,760
I need a... Okay, we are ending somebody's bloodline before I fucking kill something for real.

2263
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:20,820
Alright, there's no way.

2264
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:24,960
Oh, he gave a warning call.

2265
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:25,940
He's here somewhere.

2266
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:32,000
I need to end somebody's bloodline.

2267
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:36,200
Like, somebody's bloodline will end some way or another.

2268
02:03:40,150 --> 02:03:41,250
He was here.

2269
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:43,490
He was warning me.

2270
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:45,190
He was like, do not approach.

2271
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:52,520
Do you see him?

2272
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:54,640
I don't see any fucking moose anywhere.

2273
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:03,000
Like, I'm just crawling.

2274
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:17,450
Where the fuck is this stupid fucking moose?

2275
02:04:18,770 --> 02:04:19,370
Where?

2276
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:21,650
Oh my god, he's here.

2277
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:22,070
Okay.

2278
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:39,030
What?

2279
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:48,420
Okay, there we go.

2280
02:04:48,580 --> 02:04:49,060
I hit him.

2281
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:50,480
Okay, there's fine.

2282
02:04:50,620 --> 02:04:51,160
I did it.

2283
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:52,140
I hit him.

2284
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:56,840
Okay.

2285
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,960
Alright, let's go.

2286
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:01,300
Let's fucking go.

2287
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:02,580
I hit him.

2288
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:04,100
That's all that matters.

2289
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,340
He's over there.

2290
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:13,780
Alright, let's go.

2291
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:14,220
That's fine.

2292
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:17,420
I know where you... I saw where you ran at.

2293
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:19,780
You're like here somewhere.

2294
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:23,260
Alright.

2295
02:05:23,260 --> 02:05:23,500
Alright.

2296
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:26,920
God, it's very low again.

2297
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:28,480
It's a very low bloodshot too.

2298
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:29,560
That's the worst part.

2299
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:32,100
Alright.

2300
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:37,260
Okay.

2301
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:40,880
I'll just shoot multiple times.

2302
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,400
Like, I'll make it work.

2303
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:48,020
Where did he go?

2304
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:50,420
I swear to fucking god.

2305
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:51,700
I swear to god.

2306
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:53,680
If he fucking disappears.

2307
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:55,580
I swear to god.

2308
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:58,260
Where did he go?

2309
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,420
Oh my god.

2310
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:04,780
I swear to god.

2311
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:05,250
Oh my...

2312
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:10,740
Where did he go?

2313
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:15,120
That's the same guy.

2314
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:16,860
That has to be the same guy.

2315
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:28,460
That has to be the same moose.

2316
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:32,940
There's no way.

2317
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:37,240
That has to be him.

2318
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:42,300
I don't know what the fuck happened to the other trail, but like...

2319
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:42,980
Oh

2320
02:06:52,610 --> 02:06:54,270
my...

2321
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:56,410
What happened to my trail?

2322
02:06:57,650 --> 02:06:59,510
Like, what happened?

2323
02:07:01,170 --> 02:07:02,970
What happened to my tracker?

2324
02:07:02,970 --> 02:07:05,430
Like, I don't understand.

2325
02:07:06,470 --> 02:07:08,090
It actually disappeared again.

2326
02:07:11,830 --> 02:07:13,430
I should have bought the bloodhound.

2327
02:07:13,570 --> 02:07:15,170
Why did I bring a golden retriever?

2328
02:07:17,570 --> 02:07:19,410
Why did I bring a golden retriever?

2329
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:20,810
I should have just...

2330
02:07:23,150 --> 02:07:24,270
Oh my god.

2331
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:26,650
I lost the tracks again.

2332
02:07:30,410 --> 02:07:34,670
Like, I look here and then there's no more blue trails.

2333
02:07:35,730 --> 02:07:38,110
Like, what do you mean?

2334
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:43,590
Like, he ran this way and then the trail disappears.

2335
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:47,470
Oh my god, there it is.

2336
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:49,870
Oh my god, there it is.

2337
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:52,590
I found it.

2338
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:53,950
I found it.

2339
02:07:54,010 --> 02:07:55,970
I found the stupid fucking trail.

2340
02:07:55,970 --> 02:07:57,550
Oh my gosh.

2341
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:01,690
He ran this way.

2342
02:08:06,210 --> 02:08:07,430
Then where did he go?

2343
02:08:08,690 --> 02:08:09,570
Oh, he went this way.

2344
02:08:09,650 --> 02:08:09,830
Okay.

2345
02:08:14,230 --> 02:08:14,710
Okay.

2346
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:21,480
Alright, we figured it out, guys.

2347
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:24,980
Oh no, he's gonna fucking disappear again.

2348
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:25,800
I can feel it.

2349
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:31,240
Okay, it's a mother and a child.

2350
02:08:31,940 --> 02:08:33,160
So like...

2351
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:37,690
Alright, we got this.

2352
02:08:37,790 --> 02:08:38,970
Okay, we'll shoot the lungs.

2353
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:44,870
Okay, but I did hit a shot 200 meters away, guys.

2354
02:08:44,990 --> 02:08:45,490
Come on.

2355
02:08:46,790 --> 02:08:49,170
Is that not brag-worthy right there?

2356
02:08:55,010 --> 02:08:57,210
Did he fucking disappear again?

2357
02:08:58,350 --> 02:08:59,370
No, it's over here.

2358
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:07,570
Okay, I need to wait for another...

2359
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:07,930
No!

2360
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:14,070
Okay, he ran because he heard me here when I was trying to fucking find his tracks.

2361
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:19,350
Alright.

2362
02:09:22,050 --> 02:09:23,550
I hope I hit the child.

2363
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:28,010
If it was a child, because it might be easier to kill.

2364
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:36,340
It's this way.

2365
02:09:42,770 --> 02:09:44,110
Alright, very low.

2366
02:09:45,290 --> 02:09:47,270
Oh my god, their blood is so low.

2367
02:09:51,890 --> 02:09:56,230
Okay, to be fair, I was sort of trying to aim for the head, but then I realized it might not have worked.

2368
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:03,450
I was trying to aim for the head there.

2369
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:13,470
Moose is close by.

2370
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:20,830
Where the fuck is this moose?

2371
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:22,690
Did he really run that far?

2372
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:27,140
Like, where...

2373
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:29,820
No!

2374
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:31,720
There they are, there they are, there they are, there they are.

2375
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:36,160
There he is.

2376
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:41,290
There he is.

2377
02:10:46,890 --> 02:10:48,190
Oh my god, there he is.

2378
02:10:50,350 --> 02:10:51,810
Oh my god, I swear to god, lie down.

2379
02:10:52,210 --> 02:10:52,930
I swear to god.

2380
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:56,680
Lay down.

2381
02:10:57,180 --> 02:10:58,120
I swear to god.

2382
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:03,960
I swear to god, if this moose fucking runs away again, I swear to fucking god, I...

2383
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:10,370
I don't see him, that's the worst part.

2384
02:11:10,430 --> 02:11:11,430
I don't know where he is.

2385
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:15,630
Where did he go?

2386
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:17,590
Where did he go?

2387
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:27,720
Where the fuck did he go?

2388
02:11:32,570 --> 02:11:33,630
Where is he?

2389
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:38,490
He literally looked at me.

2390
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:48,040
Where did he go?

2391
02:11:55,950 --> 02:11:57,270
He just walked away?

2392
02:12:08,070 --> 02:12:09,810
Okay, I don't...

2393
02:12:09,810 --> 02:12:13,430
Go and do your mating shit, I'm trying to find a moose right now.

2394
02:12:16,290 --> 02:12:18,150
Bro, he just walked away.

2395
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:19,270
How

2396
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:31,720
far could you walk away?

2397
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,240
There's no cover.

2398
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:38,500
There's no cover whatsoever.

2399
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:43,960
He just walked away.

2400
02:12:47,190 --> 02:12:49,590
Yes, I killed like two wolves.

2401
02:12:51,170 --> 02:12:52,030
And that was it.

2402
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:53,510
That was it.

2403
02:12:54,230 --> 02:12:55,770
That was the end of my journey.

2404
02:13:05,830 --> 02:13:06,250
I'm bleeding.

2405
02:13:10,110 --> 02:13:11,870
ARE YOU FUCKING

2406
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:18,000
KIDDING...

2407
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:18,600
Goodbye.

2408
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:21,020
Goodbye.

2409
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:26,540
Good fucking bye, I guess.

2410
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:27,840
Goodbye.

2411
02:13:33,110 --> 02:13:34,950
Okay, very old.

2412
02:13:35,210 --> 02:13:38,910
Okay, he's been here a very long time ago.

2413
02:13:42,110 --> 02:13:43,970
Guys, the trail ended here.

2414
02:13:44,930 --> 02:13:47,750
Guys, the trail ended here.

2415
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:48,510
Guys.

2416
02:13:49,810 --> 02:13:52,430
Oh thank god, there's... Nevermind, I found it.

2417
02:13:52,630 --> 02:13:53,910
I found it.

2418
02:13:56,530 --> 02:13:57,850
I found it.

2419
02:13:58,430 --> 02:14:01,990
We'll find this stupid ass moose somewhere.

2420
02:14:04,450 --> 02:14:05,870
Oh my god.

2421
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:08,250
Okay, he came back.

2422
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:08,650
Alright.

2423
02:14:09,170 --> 02:14:12,130
We're gonna find this stupid moose somewhere.

2424
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:14,090
I can't believe I didn't get the baby.

2425
02:14:14,410 --> 02:14:15,810
The baby would have been easier.

2426
02:14:15,810 --> 02:14:17,150
He ran?

2427
02:14:17,590 --> 02:14:17,690
When?

2428
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:18,810
I wasn't...

2429
02:14:25,490 --> 02:14:26,850
This is it.

2430
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:28,350
This is it.

2431
02:14:28,790 --> 02:14:30,450
They won't walk away.

2432
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:31,870
This is it.

2433
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:33,390
There's so many of them.

2434
02:14:34,290 --> 02:14:35,690
Oh my god.

2435
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:37,290
This is the motherlode.

2436
02:14:38,170 --> 02:14:39,350
Oh my god.

2437
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:41,090
I'm gonna slowly get over it.

2438
02:14:41,110 --> 02:14:44,330
There's no way by the time I get there, they would be dead.

2439
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:46,590
This is the motherlode.

2440
02:14:46,690 --> 02:14:47,390
This time.

2441
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:48,930
Oh my...

2442
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:49,850
Oh, I have to prone that.

2443
02:14:50,030 --> 02:14:50,670
Okay, wait.

2444
02:14:51,630 --> 02:14:52,170
Okay.

2445
02:14:53,290 --> 02:14:55,030
Oh my god, I keep accidentally proning.

2446
02:14:55,250 --> 02:14:55,850
I'm sorry.

2447
02:14:56,770 --> 02:14:58,190
This is the motherlode.

2448
02:14:59,350 --> 02:15:01,390
This is the actual...

2449
02:15:02,350 --> 02:15:02,890
Alright.

2450
02:15:04,990 --> 02:15:06,490
There's no way they see me.

2451
02:15:07,370 --> 02:15:08,770
I'm gonna go to the side.

2452
02:15:09,150 --> 02:15:10,510
Let's just do this.

2453
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:14,460
Okay, you stay here.

2454
02:15:21,790 --> 02:15:22,330
Okay.

2455
02:15:24,850 --> 02:15:25,490
They know.

2456
02:15:26,570 --> 02:15:27,290
They know.

2457
02:15:27,830 --> 02:15:28,330
No, they don't.

2458
02:15:28,410 --> 02:15:29,050
They didn't see me.

2459
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:31,170
They don't see me, guys.

2460
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:35,610
They didn't see me.

2461
02:15:36,730 --> 02:15:37,710
No, they didn't.

2462
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:39,290
They were just giving warning calls.

2463
02:15:39,370 --> 02:15:40,150
They don't see me.

2464
02:15:40,850 --> 02:15:41,410
No, guys.

2465
02:15:41,470 --> 02:15:41,670
Shh.

2466
02:15:41,830 --> 02:15:43,150
They don't see me, guys.

2467
02:15:46,410 --> 02:15:47,350
They're just warning.

2468
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:50,070
No, they're still there.

2469
02:15:50,150 --> 02:15:50,670
They're still there.

2470
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:51,370
I swear to god.

2471
02:15:51,810 --> 02:15:52,430
I swear to god.

2472
02:15:52,430 --> 02:15:54,770
I'm gonna pop up from underneath the tree.

2473
02:15:55,950 --> 02:15:56,750
And then...

2474
02:15:56,750 --> 02:15:57,450
I swear to god.

2475
02:15:57,590 --> 02:15:58,110
Stay down.

2476
02:15:58,710 --> 02:16:01,850
They don't see me, guys.

2477
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:04,110
I'm gonna pop up from underneath this tree.

2478
02:16:04,850 --> 02:16:06,970
And then I'm gonna see all of the family.

2479
02:16:07,890 --> 02:16:08,330
No, no, no.

2480
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:10,910
They're not done drinking.

2481
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:12,110
They're gonna be there.

2482
02:16:12,250 --> 02:16:12,950
I swear to god.

2483
02:16:13,210 --> 02:16:18,950
The moment I pop up from this grass, I'm gonna see the family.

2484
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:23,270
They're gonna be right there.

2485
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:25,570
The moment the grass is gone.

2486
02:16:28,660 --> 02:16:30,860
It's gonna be right there.

2487
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:33,740
Right here.

2488
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,960
The moment the grass is...

2489
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:40,880
The moment I get past all this grass.

2490
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:43,100
I will see them.

2491
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:46,160
Right here.

2492
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:47,640
Right now.

2493
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:51,100
Where am I in this pile of grass?

2494
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:56,340
Wait, how do I see anything from here?

2495
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:01,290
Right here.

2496
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:03,190
Right now.

2497
02:17:03,410 --> 02:17:06,110
They're gonna be over there.

2498
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:07,930
Where am I?

2499
02:17:09,870 --> 02:17:11,110
Right here.

2500
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:13,350
Right now.

2501
02:17:16,390 --> 02:17:17,930
Where's the lake?

2502
02:17:18,370 --> 02:17:19,530
Am I like...

2503
02:17:19,530 --> 02:17:20,070
Okay.

2504
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:25,450
They're right there.

2505
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:26,670
No, they're still there.

2506
02:17:27,090 --> 02:17:27,910
No, they're still there.

2507
02:17:28,110 --> 02:17:28,910
Guys, guys, guys.

2508
02:17:31,470 --> 02:17:32,130
Almost there.

2509
02:17:32,850 --> 02:17:34,190
Oh my god, we're almost there.

2510
02:17:34,190 --> 02:17:36,230
Okay, where is it from?

2511
02:17:39,570 --> 02:17:40,010
Okay.

2512
02:17:40,290 --> 02:17:41,090
They're still there.

2513
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:41,770
They're still there.

2514
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:42,510
They're still there.

2515
02:17:42,890 --> 02:17:44,150
They're actually still there.

2516
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:44,790
Holy fuck.

2517
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:45,890
I had to...

2518
02:17:45,890 --> 02:17:48,310
I didn't believe for a second.

2519
02:17:48,970 --> 02:17:49,850
But they're still there.

2520
02:17:50,210 --> 02:17:52,290
They're actually still there.

2521
02:17:53,570 --> 02:17:56,190
Okay, I had to get up to double check.

2522
02:17:58,450 --> 02:17:59,630
I had to...

2523
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:01,950
I had to double check if they're still there.

2524
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:03,450
Alright.

2525
02:18:16,140 --> 02:18:17,180
Is this the lungs?

2526
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:18,600
Right here?

2527
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:19,760
Is that the lungs?

2528
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:21,280
If I shoot here, will I hit the lungs?

2529
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,120
If I shoot here, will I hit the lungs, guys?

2530
02:18:25,460 --> 02:18:26,120
Right here.

2531
02:18:31,490 --> 02:18:32,130
Right here.

2532
02:18:47,390 --> 02:18:48,850
I'm so sad.

2533
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:53,440
I'm so...

2534
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:55,520
I'm so sad.

2535
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,800
You guys said there's no bullet drop!

2536
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:02,840
Is there?

2537
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:04,260
Oh my god!

2538
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:05,240
Wait.

2539
02:19:05,540 --> 02:19:06,220
They don't die.

2540
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:15,740
I swear to god.

2541
02:19:21,390 --> 02:19:22,930
He's too slow.

2542
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:32,070
I swear to god there's a...

2543
02:19:44,190 --> 02:19:46,030
Get out.

2544
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:48,310
Are you still alive?

2545
02:19:52,330 --> 02:19:53,250
Bro!

2546
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:56,880
What the fuck?!

2547
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:57,440
Do it to me!

2548
02:19:57,980 --> 02:19:58,900
Do it to me!

2549
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:03,220
Bro!

2550
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:06,400
This won't take...

2551
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:08,240
This won't take...

2552
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:08,800
My

2553
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:21,970
god!

2554
02:20:22,210 --> 02:20:25,210
You just let him do that to me?!

2555
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:31,470
This won't live!

2556
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:33,570
I don't understand!

2557
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:37,250
Oh my god!

2558
02:20:38,290 --> 02:20:40,950
He was too angry to die.

2559
02:20:41,290 --> 02:20:42,810
Okay, what kills...

2560
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:43,510
Okay.

2561
02:20:45,830 --> 02:20:46,650
What?

2562
02:20:47,250 --> 02:20:47,730
Fuck.

2563
02:20:48,250 --> 02:20:49,910
I'm too broke, guys.

2564
02:20:50,010 --> 02:20:51,750
All I have is the free gun.

2565
02:20:51,990 --> 02:20:54,390
I don't have anything else.

2566
02:20:54,790 --> 02:20:57,210
I only have the free gun.

2567
02:20:57,710 --> 02:20:59,350
I don't understand!

2568
02:21:00,570 --> 02:21:02,990
This won't live so long.

2569
02:21:05,790 --> 02:21:07,550
Oh my god.

2570
02:21:08,170 --> 02:21:10,910
He's a tracker, not a...

2571
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:13,570
He has a very realistic...

2572
02:21:13,570 --> 02:21:15,910
I shot him four times!

2573
02:21:16,330 --> 02:21:17,950
I don't understand!

2574
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:21,310
Thank you for the super chat.

2575
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:21,750
Thank you.

2576
02:21:21,870 --> 02:21:22,330
Thank you.

2577
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:25,330
You're using the wrong caliber ammo for moves that are like...

2578
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:25,930
That are not...

2579
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:27,250
Like, if you open your map after...

2580
02:21:27,250 --> 02:21:28,530
You'll see purple on the map.

2581
02:21:28,850 --> 02:21:31,070
If you killed it, indicating hunter pressure.

2582
02:21:31,630 --> 02:21:32,870
Oh, like here?

2583
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:34,450
It's purple.

2584
02:21:35,730 --> 02:21:38,030
Thank you for the super chat.

2585
02:21:38,290 --> 02:21:39,130
Thank you, thank you.

2586
02:21:39,330 --> 02:21:39,870
Who will win?

2587
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:42,330
A noob with a .22 pistol?

2588
02:21:42,830 --> 02:21:44,160
Or a tank wolf?

2589
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:45,130
Me.

2590
02:21:45,230 --> 02:21:46,770
Thank you for the super chat.

2591
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:48,590
Thank you, thank you.

2592
02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:50,810
Oh my god.

2593
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:53,870
I can't believe it.

2594
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:57,150
I can't believe...

2595
02:21:57,150 --> 02:21:59,000
I can't believe...

2596
02:21:59,490 --> 02:22:01,610
It fucking lived for so long.

2597
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:05,710
Oh, hunter...

2598
02:22:05,710 --> 02:22:06,150
Win pressure.

2599
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:08,970
Mid pressure, mid pressure.

2600
02:22:10,610 --> 02:22:11,670
I can't believe...

2601
02:22:11,670 --> 02:22:12,710
Who healed him?

2602
02:22:13,150 --> 02:22:16,490
That wolf was the tankiest fucking shit ever!

2603
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:20,090
Who the fuck healed this stupid fucking wolf?

2604
02:22:20,590 --> 02:22:21,030
I...

2605
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:23,210
Thank you, killed.

2606
02:22:23,490 --> 02:22:24,050
Did I?

2607
02:22:26,170 --> 02:22:27,550
Did I kill him?

2608
02:22:28,410 --> 02:22:30,490
I don't fucking know where I killed him.

2609
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:32,570
When did I...

2610
02:22:32,570 --> 02:22:34,450
When did I shot a thing here?

2611
02:22:39,330 --> 02:22:42,590
It was a paladin build, he healed himself.

2612
02:22:47,210 --> 02:22:48,950
Oh my god, thank god he...

2613
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:50,330
This fucker bleed out.

2614
02:22:50,530 --> 02:22:51,750
Fuck that wolf.

2615
02:22:52,290 --> 02:22:54,570
Why didn't I have a dead zone here?

2616
02:22:54,690 --> 02:22:55,750
What happened here?

2617
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:59,670
Cause I know I killed something.

2618
02:22:59,890 --> 02:23:01,810
What the fuck happened here?

2619
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:12,120
Let's check the purple zone.

2620
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:13,680
Okay, I'm gonna be in the purple zone.

2621
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:14,340
I'm just gonna run.

2622
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:21,170
Maybe I'll find a fucking dead moose here.

2623
02:23:23,490 --> 02:23:26,430
Alright, we're almost at the purple zone.

2624
02:23:30,310 --> 02:23:33,610
He put me in a stupid fucking highlight reel.

2625
02:23:35,090 --> 02:23:35,690
Alright.

2626
02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:39,530
Almost there.

2627
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:49,650
There's a bison?!

2628
02:24:03,030 --> 02:24:04,550
Oh, he saw me.

2629
02:24:09,050 --> 02:24:11,110
Wait, but it's a purple zone.

2630
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:14,170
You're gunning and killing that?

2631
02:24:14,470 --> 02:24:15,550
Oh, okay.

2632
02:24:19,010 --> 02:24:21,210
Those are protected animals.

2633
02:24:21,610 --> 02:24:23,490
Yeah, in my nature reserve.

2634
02:24:25,950 --> 02:24:28,910
I put them there for me to hunt.

2635
02:24:42,060 --> 02:24:44,300
Hey, but somebody said the moose died.

2636
02:24:44,300 --> 02:24:46,500
Where the fuck did the moose die?

2637
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:55,230
What can my gun kill at this point?

2638
02:24:55,650 --> 02:25:00,450
Can I even kill a deer?

2639
02:25:01,150 --> 02:25:02,730
Like, what can I kill?

2640
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:08,370
Oh, rat birds.

2641
02:25:08,870 --> 02:25:11,170
Oh my god, I'm not going back to the...

2642
02:25:11,530 --> 02:25:12,870
Guys, what about caribous?

2643
02:25:13,050 --> 02:25:14,190
Can I kill caribous?

2644
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:27,770
Probably not.

2645
02:25:27,770 --> 02:25:30,210
So I've been hunting that caribou for no fucking reason.

2646
02:25:30,290 --> 02:25:30,670
Okay.

2647
02:25:30,990 --> 02:25:32,910
Alright, I'm leaving Alaska.

2648
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:47,620
Oh my god, there's no deer here!

2649
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:52,520
Everything here is just caribous, moose, and like a wolf.

2650
02:25:55,740 --> 02:25:58,720
And I found a bison too.

2651
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:02,800
Guys, I'm at the...

2652
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:04,320
Wait, there's a red fox.

2653
02:26:04,460 --> 02:26:04,660
Okay.

2654
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:06,380
Wait, I can cut down the fox.

2655
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:08,960
Wait, I can hunt kill foxes though.

2656
02:26:10,360 --> 02:26:12,140
Wait, I might be able to kill a fox though.

2657
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:13,960
Alright.

2658
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:16,100
He pooped somewhere near here.

2659
02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:17,640
Alright, next mission.

2660
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:18,660
A fucking fox.

2661
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:25,830
Okay, he's been trotting.

2662
02:26:28,050 --> 02:26:30,390
Wait, hover over the ammo and it'll show you?

2663
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:33,270
Okay.

2664
02:26:34,110 --> 02:26:35,410
How do I hover my ammo?

2665
02:26:35,770 --> 02:26:35,870
Here?

2666
02:26:41,230 --> 02:26:42,530
How do I do it?

2667
02:26:43,870 --> 02:26:44,430
Whatever.

2668
02:26:50,670 --> 02:26:52,690
Don't worry, I will kill something.

2669
02:26:54,430 --> 02:26:57,650
Guys, the only thing I've killed here were the fucking...

2670
02:26:59,010 --> 02:27:00,270
Oh, where's the ammo tab?

2671
02:27:01,630 --> 02:27:02,410
Oh, ammo!

2672
02:27:04,290 --> 02:27:05,750
I can kill...

2673
02:27:05,750 --> 02:27:06,810
Okay, you liars!

2674
02:27:06,890 --> 02:27:08,350
I can kill a caribou!

2675
02:27:09,270 --> 02:27:09,830
Yeah!

2676
02:27:10,910 --> 02:27:12,930
Oh my god, I could've killed a caribou.

2677
02:27:18,380 --> 02:27:19,500
That's a caribou!

2678
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:22,660
Okay, it's very old.

2679
02:27:22,820 --> 02:27:23,900
Okay, he might be gone-gone.

2680
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:26,920
Okay, so it's just...

2681
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:28,180
Look, it's not a skill issue.

2682
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:28,900
I just...

2683
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:30,480
He like climbed a tree or something.

2684
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:31,380
Guys.

2685
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:32,880
He fucking climbed a tree.

2686
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:34,560
Like, what was I supposed to do?

2687
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:35,600
Like...

2688
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:38,120
He climbed a tree and flew away.

2689
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:40,760
Okay.

2690
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:43,560
Took you for like the past half hour.

2691
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:53,000
Okay, do they or do they not have bullet drop?

2692
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:54,060
Like, please.

2693
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:55,980
I've been going in.

2694
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:57,180
I can't...

2695
02:27:57,180 --> 02:27:58,760
Like, I'm getting like...

2696
02:27:58,760 --> 02:28:01,680
Look, I have to adjust my gun.

2697
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:04,740
I need to know.

2698
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:06,120
Do they or...

2699
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:08,580
Okay, no, do they not?

2700
02:28:08,680 --> 02:28:10,120
And then yes, and then...

2701
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:11,440
Guys, like...

2702
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:17,780
How I aim is affected by whether or not there is bullet drop.

2703
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:18,880
Yes.

2704
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:25,140
No.

2705
02:28:25,820 --> 02:28:27,860
I don't know what's a lie.

2706
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:29,640
Like, I don't know either!

2707
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:31,380
Is there wind?

2708
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:33,600
Yes,

2709
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:39,020
they do not.

2710
02:28:43,930 --> 02:28:44,650
Alright.

2711
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:52,680
Bullet drop is when the bullet starts dropping.

2712
02:28:58,110 --> 02:28:58,910
Bro, fuck this.

2713
02:28:58,970 --> 02:29:00,590
I'm not gonna find anything around me.

2714
02:29:01,310 --> 02:29:09,890
Oh my god!

2715
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:15,970
Okay, there was some...

2716
02:29:15,970 --> 02:29:18,630
Oh, now there's something over there.

2717
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:24,780
God fucking damn it.

2718
02:29:29,850 --> 02:29:31,390
Oh my god.

2719
02:29:31,790 --> 02:29:33,250
Hunting is so hard.

2720
02:29:33,550 --> 02:29:36,390
Hunting is so hard, guys.

2721
02:29:37,190 --> 02:29:38,690
Who would've thought?

2722
02:29:39,410 --> 02:29:41,350
Hunting was so difficult.

2723
02:29:47,610 --> 02:29:49,130
Okay, there's tracks.

2724
02:29:49,830 --> 02:29:50,190
Okay.

2725
02:29:51,010 --> 02:29:52,190
I have tracks on me.

2726
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:54,490
This is where he fled, right?

2727
02:29:55,550 --> 02:29:56,690
Okay, red zone.

2728
02:29:59,750 --> 02:30:01,310
He went this way.

2729
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:04,410
Okay.

2730
02:30:05,930 --> 02:30:07,110
What is over there?

2731
02:30:08,490 --> 02:30:09,790
Is this where he's resting?

2732
02:30:12,630 --> 02:30:14,370
Is this maybe where he's resting?

2733
02:30:15,410 --> 02:30:15,930
Dad?

2734
02:30:17,110 --> 02:30:18,430
Think he's still there?

2735
02:30:19,130 --> 02:30:19,530
Sleeping?

2736
02:30:27,670 --> 02:30:32,830
I'll be so fucked up if I just find one of them just sleeping there and I just take the shot right there.

2737
02:30:33,550 --> 02:30:35,310
Do I just go like...

2738
02:30:38,450 --> 02:30:41,390
I'm not desperate enough to do that.

2739
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:46,210
And then I miss.

2740
02:30:46,650 --> 02:30:50,050
And then I fucking miss.

2741
02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:50,790
You know what?

2742
02:30:50,830 --> 02:30:51,730
No, you're right.

2743
02:30:51,930 --> 02:30:53,070
No, you're fucking right.

2744
02:30:58,330 --> 02:31:02,290
I see him resting and I fucking miss right here.

2745
02:31:02,730 --> 02:31:03,430
Point blank.

2746
02:31:10,450 --> 02:31:14,670
I shoot and I missed and I missed again and I shot my gun and I missed.

2747
02:31:16,070 --> 02:31:17,870
This is the entire stream.

2748
02:31:18,190 --> 02:31:20,090
This is the entire stream.

2749
02:31:23,570 --> 02:31:24,110
Okay.

2750
02:31:27,070 --> 02:31:28,770
He's trotting, he's not scared.

2751
02:31:31,050 --> 02:31:32,090
Might be close.

2752
02:31:32,190 --> 02:31:33,170
He can't run away far.

2753
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:38,400
Come on.

2754
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:43,740
Come on, little guy.

2755
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:47,040
Come on, you must not have ran far, right?

2756
02:31:57,530 --> 02:32:02,770
Guys, if I knew my equipment affects this so much, I would have paid to win.

2757
02:32:02,930 --> 02:32:10,270
I would have paid to win if I knew.

2758
02:32:15,140 --> 02:32:19,400
If I knew these guns are fucking dog shit, unless I paid, I would have.

2759
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:22,220
Okay.

2760
02:32:22,220 --> 02:32:26,380
Is she on the Alaska map with the .243?

2761
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:29,740
I just wanted to fucking be in Canada.

2762
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:35,440
I didn't know the starting gun fucking sucks in Alaska.

2763
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:40,380
I just wanted to be and then they still put me in Alaska.

2764
02:32:45,590 --> 02:32:46,210
Okay.

2765
02:32:47,450 --> 02:32:49,870
I'm not even in Canada, that's the worst.

2766
02:32:49,870 --> 02:32:52,850
I literally bought this map because I wanted to be in Canada.

2767
02:32:54,550 --> 02:32:57,270
This was designed for ending.

2768
02:32:59,150 --> 02:33:00,590
God damn it!

2769
02:33:05,560 --> 02:33:06,880
That's it, I'm leaving Canada.

2770
02:33:07,100 --> 02:33:07,720
Fuck this.

2771
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:08,060
Okay.

2772
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:09,560
I'm leaving Canada.

2773
02:33:09,660 --> 02:33:10,080
I'm running.

2774
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:11,020
I'm straight up running.

2775
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:11,920
You can't run forever.

2776
02:33:12,380 --> 02:33:13,400
I'm straight up running.

2777
02:33:13,940 --> 02:33:15,080
You can't run forever.

2778
02:33:15,740 --> 02:33:17,040
I'll find what you look like.

2779
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:20,600
Oh, it's very fresh.

2780
02:33:20,660 --> 02:33:21,600
I know you're close.

2781
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:23,860
I'm going to fucking get you.

2782
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:29,120
What the fuck?

2783
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:32,640
Okay, I know I can't kill you.

2784
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:33,780
I'm leaving.

2785
02:33:34,420 --> 02:33:36,660
I know I can't kill you.

2786
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:44,760
Can I at least kill...

2787
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:45,700
Oh, I can't kill a bear.

2788
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:47,180
There's no way I can kill a bear.

2789
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:51,240
I'm going to find where you live, fox.

2790
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:54,360
You're in the open now.

2791
02:34:01,530 --> 02:34:02,610
Where is he?

2792
02:34:08,530 --> 02:34:09,910
You're in the open.

2793
02:34:15,150 --> 02:34:16,330
Where are you?

2794
02:34:24,970 --> 02:34:26,230
Okay, lay down.

2795
02:34:28,190 --> 02:34:29,370
You sit down.

2796
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:31,790
He's somewhere close by.

2797
02:34:32,130 --> 02:34:32,930
I know it.

2798
02:34:39,090 --> 02:34:39,470
Alright.

2799
02:34:40,990 --> 02:34:42,470
He has to be close by.

2800
02:34:42,550 --> 02:34:43,750
There's no fucking way.

2801
02:34:44,470 --> 02:34:46,630
I refuse to believe he's not close.

2802
02:34:50,630 --> 02:34:52,310
Come on, little guy.

2803
02:34:53,790 --> 02:34:57,130
Why is it taking so long to find one?

2804
02:34:58,430 --> 02:35:01,350
I'm trying my best, okay?

2805
02:35:01,990 --> 02:35:03,430
Okay, guys.

2806
02:35:03,850 --> 02:35:07,030
I am trying my absolute best.

2807
02:35:10,970 --> 02:35:14,570
It's not my fault that they keep disappearing.

2808
02:35:14,910 --> 02:35:16,750
It's not my fault.

2809
02:35:18,210 --> 02:35:21,290
You must be around here.

2810
02:35:21,290 --> 02:35:23,330
You can't walk forever.

2811
02:35:23,610 --> 02:35:24,910
You must be.

2812
02:35:25,470 --> 02:35:28,610
There's no way you can disappear again.

2813
02:35:29,570 --> 02:35:31,490
I swear to fucking God.

2814
02:35:32,650 --> 02:35:35,150
One of you has to show up.

2815
02:35:37,010 --> 02:35:38,750
Very fresh.

2816
02:35:39,270 --> 02:35:42,390
Very fresh poop right here.

2817
02:35:43,590 --> 02:35:45,410
Very, very fresh.

2818
02:35:45,690 --> 02:35:47,110
That means you're here.

2819
02:35:47,630 --> 02:35:49,510
You're very close by.

2820
02:35:50,510 --> 02:35:53,950
Oh my God, you're so close by.

2821
02:35:58,340 --> 02:36:00,860
Where are you, little guy?

2822
02:36:02,510 --> 02:36:04,550
Where are you?

2823
02:36:06,870 --> 02:36:08,820
Come on, come on.

2824
02:36:12,980 --> 02:36:15,540
Where are you?

2825
02:36:17,380 --> 02:36:19,820
You went this way.

2826
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:23,620
Can't walk forever, little guy.

2827
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:27,100
Come out, come out.

2828
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:31,240
Where the fuck did the tracks go?

2829
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:33,760
You poop again for me real quick?

2830
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:36,880
Where the fuck?

2831
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:43,000
Like, do you see anything?

2832
02:36:43,560 --> 02:36:44,380
I don't.

2833
02:36:45,320 --> 02:36:47,040
Where the fuck did this trail go?

2834
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:53,200
Okay, we can't deal with the moose, so...

2835
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:54,580
Wait, it's gone!

2836
02:36:57,780 --> 02:36:58,940
What the fuck?

2837
02:37:00,700 --> 02:37:02,080
Where did it go?

2838
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:08,800
Did he also start climbing?

2839
02:37:12,890 --> 02:37:15,110
Did he also grow wings?

2840
02:37:15,630 --> 02:37:17,590
Where the fuck did the tracks go?

2841
02:37:31,770 --> 02:37:33,330
Oh my God, it's over here.

2842
02:37:37,650 --> 02:37:39,610
I think he walked this way too far.

2843
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:40,530
He's gonna run.

2844
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:42,410
He's gonna fucking run now.

2845
02:37:44,910 --> 02:37:47,430
He's just casually trotting along.

2846
02:37:54,040 --> 02:37:57,660
He's gonna see me before I see him and then he's gonna fucking run away.

2847
02:37:57,980 --> 02:38:00,180
Like a little bitch that he is.

2848
02:38:08,730 --> 02:38:11,250
What the fuck is this stupid fox, you whore?

2849
02:38:12,430 --> 02:38:13,570
You had to pay rent.

2850
02:38:15,030 --> 02:38:16,810
You're three months behind.

2851
02:38:28,910 --> 02:38:30,750
There's another track here?

2852
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:36,930
Wait, there's two fox tracks.

2853
02:38:37,390 --> 02:38:38,110
No, that's a deer.

2854
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:46,450
Okay, it's fresh, but not very fresh.

2855
02:38:46,550 --> 02:38:48,130
So he's not as close by.

2856
02:38:49,950 --> 02:38:51,490
Wait, no, those are white tracks.

2857
02:38:52,670 --> 02:38:54,130
Where did the blue tracks go?

2858
02:38:55,810 --> 02:38:58,170
Oh my God, where did the blue tracks go?

2859
02:39:00,230 --> 02:39:01,830
He pooped and he climbed.

2860
02:39:02,010 --> 02:39:02,870
I don't fucking know.

2861
02:39:02,990 --> 02:39:03,650
Okay, there it is.

2862
02:39:04,050 --> 02:39:06,450
I was gonna say, did he poop and start climbing again?

2863
02:39:10,020 --> 02:39:11,360
He might be at the lake.

2864
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:12,520
Oh my God.

2865
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:14,500
He could be drinking water.

2866
02:39:15,160 --> 02:39:16,600
Wait, there's hope.

2867
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:29,500
I don't see anything.

2868
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:31,300
I don't see anything.

2869
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:38,880
Where could this stupid fucking fox walk if it said fresh poop?

2870
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:40,580
I don't understand.

2871
02:39:40,940 --> 02:39:42,920
How fresh is this poop?

2872
02:39:51,070 --> 02:39:52,710
Oh my God, you fucker.

2873
02:39:52,770 --> 02:39:53,630
Okay, he's...

2874
02:39:53,630 --> 02:39:55,870
I thought he was gonna scare someone away.

2875
02:40:03,850 --> 02:40:05,810
He's still just trotting somewhere.

2876
02:40:06,130 --> 02:40:07,370
Wherever he is.

2877
02:40:09,570 --> 02:40:11,750
Wherever he's fucking trotting along.

2878
02:40:13,610 --> 02:40:14,090
He's still...

2879
02:40:14,090 --> 02:40:16,090
I've been following this trail for 80 years.

2880
02:40:16,450 --> 02:40:18,230
This is like my Moby Dick story.

2881
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:20,670
I'm here to fucking kill Moby Dick.

2882
02:40:23,430 --> 02:40:26,670
I'm gonna be hunting for this fox for 20 fucking years.

2883
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:32,970
No, I can't hear my voice.

2884
02:40:33,070 --> 02:40:34,770
I don't have open mic, I'm pretty sure.

2885
02:40:37,290 --> 02:40:41,990
Like, the worst part is I've never seen the fox before, but he's seen me.

2886
02:40:42,470 --> 02:40:43,800
He's seen me multiple times.

2887
02:40:44,610 --> 02:40:45,190
I don't

2888
02:40:59,040 --> 02:40:59,860
even...

2889
02:40:59,860 --> 02:41:01,000
Oh, it can smell me?

2890
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:02,240
Okay, but I have this.

2891
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:06,760
Oh wait, that's my deer call.

2892
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:10,390
I thought...

2893
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:15,220
I thought that was something else.

2894
02:41:26,270 --> 02:41:28,430
Wait, it made a sound.

2895
02:41:30,310 --> 02:41:30,940
It was like...

2896
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:40,800
Was that him?

2897
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:44,020
Was that him?

2898
02:41:45,060 --> 02:41:46,500
That has to be the fox call.

2899
02:41:51,710 --> 02:41:52,970
It was like...

2900
02:41:52,970 --> 02:41:53,170
Where

2901
02:42:00,690 --> 02:42:02,190
is he?

2902
02:42:06,470 --> 02:42:08,270
I don't know what he looks like.

2903
02:42:08,870 --> 02:42:09,390
There's

2904
02:42:38,980 --> 02:42:39,440
no way!

2905
02:42:41,940 --> 02:42:43,380
What happened to my scope?

2906
02:42:49,850 --> 02:42:51,110
Was that my shotgun?

2907
02:42:51,150 --> 02:42:51,690
Oh my god, dude.

2908
02:42:51,950 --> 02:42:52,430
He's bleeding.

2909
02:42:52,730 --> 02:42:53,210
He's bleeding.

2910
02:42:53,510 --> 02:42:54,630
He's fucking bleeding.

2911
02:42:54,910 --> 02:42:55,870
I'm fucking...

2912
02:42:57,930 --> 02:42:59,510
Wait, I downed him with an unscoped?

2913
02:43:03,010 --> 02:43:04,290
No, I didn't miss.

2914
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:07,770
I didn't miss.

2915
02:43:09,330 --> 02:43:10,130
She's bleeding.

2916
02:43:11,110 --> 02:43:12,170
He's actually bleeding.

2917
02:43:20,150 --> 02:43:21,300
Oh, he's dead.

2918
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:21,960
I did it.

2919
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:28,680
I could have followed you for 80 years!

2920
02:43:29,420 --> 02:43:32,330
Or could I have killed you?

2921
02:43:34,150 --> 02:43:35,550
I did it!

2922
02:43:35,850 --> 02:43:37,080
Oh my god!

2923
02:43:37,690 --> 02:43:39,120
I did something!

2924
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:40,460
No one else got...

2925
02:43:40,460 --> 02:43:41,940
Broke his fucking leg.

2926
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:45,780
We got him!

2927
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:47,600
We fucking got him!

2928
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:48,880
Broke your legs!

2929
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:56,350
That's fine.

2930
02:43:56,590 --> 02:43:59,170
I don't care that it's a prize.

2931
02:43:59,650 --> 02:44:00,480
I'm fine.

2932
02:44:01,390 --> 02:44:03,670
As long as I broke his legs.

2933
02:44:04,130 --> 02:44:05,970
I think that's okay.

2934
02:44:06,290 --> 02:44:08,330
What happened to my scope?

2935
02:44:08,330 --> 02:44:10,330
My scope...

2936
02:44:10,330 --> 02:44:12,570
My scope is gone.

2937
02:44:13,130 --> 02:44:15,310
I've got a taxidermy.

2938
02:44:16,070 --> 02:44:16,730
Yes!

2939
02:44:17,470 --> 02:44:18,130
Yes!

2940
02:44:19,430 --> 02:44:20,090
Yes!

2941
02:44:21,150 --> 02:44:23,750
But also, what happened to my scope?

2942
02:44:23,830 --> 02:44:24,410
It's gone.

2943
02:44:25,570 --> 02:44:26,350
I didn't...

2944
02:44:26,350 --> 02:44:28,470
I don't know what gun I was using at that...

2945
02:44:28,470 --> 02:44:29,480
No, it was actually...

2946
02:44:33,730 --> 02:44:35,930
Oh, I accidentally clicked on...

2947
02:44:35,930 --> 02:44:36,690
I was so...

2948
02:44:36,690 --> 02:44:37,630
I was so confused.

2949
02:44:38,310 --> 02:44:38,770
I didn't...

2950
02:44:38,770 --> 02:44:39,330
I was like...

2951
02:44:39,330 --> 02:44:41,110
What happened to my scope?

2952
02:44:41,210 --> 02:44:42,430
I was trying to kill him.

2953
02:44:45,790 --> 02:44:46,270
Okay.

2954
02:44:46,530 --> 02:44:47,510
Alright, we got him.

2955
02:44:47,630 --> 02:44:48,210
Okay, I'm...

2956
02:44:48,210 --> 02:44:49,390
Okay, how do I check my...

2957
02:44:50,670 --> 02:44:52,490
How do I check my trophy?

2958
02:44:52,950 --> 02:44:53,350
Alright.

2959
02:44:54,030 --> 02:44:54,970
Where's my lodge?

2960
02:44:55,970 --> 02:44:57,870
Where the fuck is my lodge?

2961
02:44:57,970 --> 02:44:58,990
I need a...

2962
02:44:58,990 --> 02:44:59,690
I need...

2963
02:44:59,690 --> 02:45:00,370
How do I...

2964
02:45:00,370 --> 02:45:02,230
I need a look at my taxidermy.

2965
02:45:02,390 --> 02:45:03,610
I don't know what...

2966
02:45:10,170 --> 02:45:11,650
I was like...

2967
02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:14,550
I had to buy the DLC?

2968
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:17,050
Oh, create lodge.

2969
02:45:17,150 --> 02:45:17,810
Where is it?

2970
02:45:18,290 --> 02:45:19,390
I can't create it.

2971
02:45:19,490 --> 02:45:20,330
Oh, there it is.

2972
02:45:20,410 --> 02:45:20,670
Okay.

2973
02:45:21,470 --> 02:45:22,990
I need to go to my lodge.

2974
02:45:27,410 --> 02:45:29,070
I fucking did it.

2975
02:45:29,090 --> 02:45:30,350
I killed a fox.

2976
02:45:31,090 --> 02:45:31,470
I killed...

2977
02:45:32,010 --> 02:45:32,770
Oh my god.

2978
02:45:32,950 --> 02:45:33,510
A miracle.

2979
02:45:34,870 --> 02:45:36,250
Oh my god.

2980
02:45:37,770 --> 02:45:38,290
Alright.

2981
02:45:38,290 --> 02:45:39,790
I'm here to find the fox.

2982
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:41,370
Where is he?

2983
02:45:42,070 --> 02:45:43,450
Where is this fucker?

2984
02:45:43,990 --> 02:45:45,710
Where the fuck is he?

2985
02:45:46,190 --> 02:45:47,130
I need to know.

2986
02:45:47,390 --> 02:45:48,170
Where did I...

2987
02:45:48,170 --> 02:45:48,950
Where is he?

2988
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:54,280
Where is my fucking fox?

2989
02:45:54,760 --> 02:45:58,340
I've chased him for 80 years to get him here.

2990
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:02,800
I have to place it down?

2991
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:06,160
How do I place it down?

2992
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:11,000
Switch to...

2993
02:46:13,510 --> 02:46:15,650
How the fuck do I place down my deer?

2994
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:19,030
Where's my fox?

2995
02:46:19,250 --> 02:46:20,610
Where is he?

2996
02:46:20,950 --> 02:46:22,550
Where the fuck is this...

2997
02:46:22,550 --> 02:46:24,570
I paid 3000 dollars.

2998
02:46:26,330 --> 02:46:27,690
Where is he?

2999
02:46:32,210 --> 02:46:33,550
I have to place him...

3000
02:46:33,550 --> 02:46:36,410
I want him displayed right here.

3001
02:46:38,410 --> 02:46:40,330
Where did my fox go?

3002
02:46:42,630 --> 02:46:44,710
I paid so much money for this.

3003
02:46:44,790 --> 02:46:46,330
They can't do this to me.

3004
02:46:46,410 --> 02:46:49,230
I actually paid so much money.

3005
02:46:49,650 --> 02:46:54,530
I don't care about the bison or the jackrabbit.

3006
02:46:54,930 --> 02:46:57,030
Where the fuck is my fox displayed?

3007
02:46:57,790 --> 02:46:59,110
Where is he?

3008
02:47:00,470 --> 02:47:04,510
Literally the only thing I care about and he's not here.

3009
02:47:04,870 --> 02:47:05,850
Oh my god.

3010
02:47:05,890 --> 02:47:06,630
There he is.

3011
02:47:06,670 --> 02:47:07,010
Okay.

3012
02:47:08,350 --> 02:47:09,850
Oh my god.

3013
02:47:09,850 --> 02:47:11,110
I did this.

3014
02:47:11,450 --> 02:47:13,470
I fucking did this.

3015
02:47:13,530 --> 02:47:13,830
Okay.

3016
02:47:14,070 --> 02:47:14,370
Wait.

3017
02:47:15,450 --> 02:47:16,830
Oh my god.

3018
02:47:16,910 --> 02:47:17,230
Yes.

3019
02:47:17,310 --> 02:47:17,570
Okay.

3020
02:47:17,670 --> 02:47:17,950
Wait.

3021
02:47:18,710 --> 02:47:18,950
Okay.

3022
02:47:18,970 --> 02:47:20,270
What pose do I want him on?

3023
02:47:21,010 --> 02:47:21,350
Alright.

3024
02:47:22,670 --> 02:47:23,490
Let's see.

3025
02:47:24,130 --> 02:47:25,030
There we go.

3026
02:47:25,570 --> 02:47:27,190
Right before I killed him.

3027
02:47:27,310 --> 02:47:28,750
This is how he looked at me.

3028
02:47:29,250 --> 02:47:30,190
There we go.

3029
02:47:30,310 --> 02:47:31,970
That's fucking right.

3030
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:35,370
Yes.

3031
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:37,590
That's right.

3032
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:38,870
I did this.

3033
02:47:41,370 --> 02:47:42,710
I did it.

3034
02:47:42,710 --> 02:47:43,010
I did it, guys.

3035
02:47:43,430 --> 02:47:44,930
I broke his leg.

3036
02:47:45,310 --> 02:47:50,770
I did it, everybody.

3037
02:47:51,430 --> 02:47:54,690
I broke his leg and now he's displayed here.

3038
02:47:58,090 --> 02:48:00,870
I fucking did it, everyone.

3039
02:48:01,390 --> 02:48:03,570
I'm so proud of myself.

3040
02:48:03,990 --> 02:48:05,290
Oh my god.

3041
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:08,610
I'm so proud of myself, guys.

3042
02:48:08,610 --> 02:48:09,550
Okay.

3043
02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:10,370
Let's...

3044
02:48:10,370 --> 02:48:10,550
Alright.

3045
02:48:10,670 --> 02:48:10,830
Wait.

3046
02:48:10,950 --> 02:48:10,990
Wait.

3047
02:48:10,990 --> 02:48:11,070
Wait.

3048
02:48:11,070 --> 02:48:12,430
Apparently, you can do a multiplayer.

3049
02:48:12,670 --> 02:48:14,090
How do I do a multiplayer?

3050
02:48:14,230 --> 02:48:14,410
Alright.

3051
02:48:14,410 --> 02:48:16,210
Show me how it's actually done, then.

3052
02:48:17,490 --> 02:48:19,090
Thank you for the...

3053
02:48:19,410 --> 02:48:20,850
Thank you.

3054
02:48:20,930 --> 02:48:21,410
Thank you.

3055
02:48:21,730 --> 02:48:28,450
I played the hunt for three hours and all I got was a fox with a broken leg.

3056
02:48:34,530 --> 02:48:35,870
That's all I got.

3057
02:48:36,290 --> 02:48:36,530
Alright.

3058
02:48:38,610 --> 02:48:39,130
Alright.

3059
02:48:39,150 --> 02:48:40,010
How do I...

3060
02:48:40,010 --> 02:48:41,770
How do I activate multiplayer?

3061
02:48:42,710 --> 02:48:43,550
Main menu.

3062
02:48:44,850 --> 02:48:45,230
Alright.

3063
02:48:45,950 --> 02:48:47,690
I'm activating multiplayer.

3064
02:48:48,050 --> 02:48:50,330
I call that a success, guys.

3065
02:48:50,730 --> 02:48:51,820
Honestly, that...

3066
02:48:52,890 --> 02:48:54,450
I call...

3067
02:48:54,450 --> 02:48:58,110
I think that's a success right there.

3068
02:48:58,350 --> 02:49:01,130
It's a success story right there.

3069
02:49:01,530 --> 02:49:01,910
Alright.

3070
02:49:03,430 --> 02:49:04,210
Alright.

3071
02:49:04,330 --> 02:49:04,650
Let's see.

3072
02:49:05,190 --> 02:49:05,970
Wait.

3073
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:06,730
Why is it...

3074
02:49:08,610 --> 02:49:09,270
Why is it not...

3075
02:49:09,270 --> 02:49:10,450
What the fuck?

3076
02:49:10,510 --> 02:49:11,290
Why is it not full screen?

3077
02:49:11,350 --> 02:49:11,470
Okay.

3078
02:49:11,530 --> 02:49:11,970
There you go.

3079
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:12,610
Alright.

3080
02:49:12,870 --> 02:49:13,390
Multiplayer.

3081
02:49:14,690 --> 02:49:15,210
Alright.

3082
02:49:16,210 --> 02:49:17,250
I shall...

3083
02:49:17,250 --> 02:49:17,730
Okay.

3084
02:49:18,370 --> 02:49:19,270
I'm gonna go to Australia.

3085
02:49:19,650 --> 02:49:20,710
Does anyone have Australia?

3086
02:49:21,950 --> 02:49:22,470
Someone...

3087
02:49:22,470 --> 02:49:22,890
Guys.

3088
02:49:23,110 --> 02:49:24,950
Someone create Australia.

3089
02:49:25,210 --> 02:49:26,590
Which one is Australia, guys?

3090
02:49:26,950 --> 02:49:28,770
Someone create Australia for me.

3091
02:49:29,510 --> 02:49:31,210
And call it...

3092
02:49:31,210 --> 02:49:32,050
Dragoontown.

3093
02:49:32,170 --> 02:49:32,530
I don't know.

3094
02:49:32,650 --> 02:49:38,590
I don't know.

3095
02:49:38,590 --> 02:49:39,750
Whoever has...

3096
02:49:40,390 --> 02:49:42,590
Whoever has the Australia DLC...

3097
02:49:43,350 --> 02:49:43,530
Alright.

3098
02:49:43,570 --> 02:49:45,530
I'm not buying Australia, guys.

3099
02:49:45,610 --> 02:49:46,530
I am not.

3100
02:49:47,010 --> 02:49:47,930
Someone call...

3101
02:49:47,930 --> 02:49:49,830
Someone create Australia right now.

3102
02:49:50,150 --> 02:49:50,870
So...

3103
02:49:55,640 --> 02:49:56,500
Oh yeah.

3104
02:49:56,620 --> 02:49:57,020
So...

3105
02:49:57,020 --> 02:49:58,160
Call it Krakow.

3106
02:49:58,360 --> 02:49:58,940
I don't...

3107
02:49:58,940 --> 02:50:00,620
Don't call it Krakow.

3108
02:50:01,640 --> 02:50:02,280
Alright.

3109
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:05,360
I believe in the dragoons.

3110
02:50:05,540 --> 02:50:07,920
I believe in the dragoons.

3111
02:50:09,020 --> 02:50:09,760
Come on.

3112
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:11,440
Someone create Australia right now.

3113
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:15,240
Someone create Australia.

3114
02:50:15,680 --> 02:50:17,040
Right now.

3115
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:20,480
Come on.

3116
02:50:20,600 --> 02:50:21,060
I know...

3117
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:23,220
I know one of you guys have it.

3118
02:50:23,440 --> 02:50:25,720
I know one of you have Australia.

3119
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:26,720
Guys.

3120
02:50:30,420 --> 02:50:31,820
Go, dragoons.

3121
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:32,320
Go.

3122
02:50:33,880 --> 02:50:36,580
I saw all of you guys judging me.

3123
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:38,560
One of you have Australia.

3124
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:42,000
You guys...

3125
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:43,120
Show me how it's done.

3126
02:50:43,180 --> 02:50:44,040
Let's kill a kangaroo.

3127
02:50:44,340 --> 02:50:44,700
Alright.

3128
02:50:45,280 --> 02:50:47,060
We end it by killing a kangaroo.

3129
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:50,560
I refuse to end stream until we kill a kangaroo.

3130
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:54,060
We got you.

3131
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:55,100
Just wait.

3132
02:51:00,620 --> 02:51:02,660
I know you guys have it.

3133
02:51:03,740 --> 02:51:05,020
So random.

3134
02:51:05,960 --> 02:51:07,500
Who plays this?

3135
02:51:08,260 --> 02:51:08,900
Apparently...

3136
02:51:08,900 --> 02:51:11,040
A lot of you guys do.

3137
02:51:13,140 --> 02:51:15,180
Kangaroo is gonna pop up.

3138
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:18,880
And on the other day, you said someone create Australia.

3139
02:51:19,360 --> 02:51:21,120
And Australians were created.

3140
02:51:21,580 --> 02:51:22,960
It was created as Doki Wishes.

3141
02:51:24,860 --> 02:51:25,380
So...

3142
02:51:26,140 --> 02:51:28,100
Athena, thank you for the super chat.

3143
02:51:28,260 --> 02:51:28,620
Thank you.

3144
02:51:28,700 --> 02:51:29,400
Thank you.

3145
02:51:30,380 --> 02:51:31,680
Come on, guys.

3146
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:32,680
What?

3147
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:33,560
Okay.

3148
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:35,240
There are more servers now.

3149
02:51:35,360 --> 02:51:36,680
But none of it is you guys.

3150
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:37,900
Just name it dragoons.

3151
02:51:37,900 --> 02:51:39,740
Just name it dragoons.

3152
02:51:44,180 --> 02:51:46,660
It's general hunting tips, Doki.

3153
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:49,380
No, we're killing a kangaroo.

3154
02:51:49,780 --> 02:51:50,480
I refuse.

3155
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:54,260
We are gonna kill a kangaroo before we end stream.

3156
02:51:58,180 --> 02:52:00,000
Still no dragoons yet.

3157
02:52:00,600 --> 02:52:02,140
I know you guys exist here.

3158
02:52:02,260 --> 02:52:06,420
I know there is a dragoon here that has a server.

3159
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:09,200
That has...

3160
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:09,960
You'll see.

3161
02:52:10,400 --> 02:52:12,360
I know you guys are here.

3162
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:18,500
Forgot to update.

3163
02:52:21,900 --> 02:52:23,580
You are very...

3164
02:52:23,580 --> 02:52:25,060
Oh, they can't name it?

3165
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:26,020
Wait.

3166
02:52:26,220 --> 02:52:27,680
How do I know which one is you?

3167
02:52:29,220 --> 02:52:30,180
Oh, it's...

3168
02:52:30,180 --> 02:52:31,180
Okay, who is the host?

3169
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:33,240
There is a lot of hosts now.

3170
02:52:33,500 --> 02:52:33,800
Which...

3171
02:52:33,800 --> 02:52:34,400
Oh, there you go.

3172
02:52:34,420 --> 02:52:34,920
I recognize.

3173
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:37,980
I recognize the dragoon name there.

3174
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:38,800
Yeah, John.

3175
02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:41,240
Alright, show me how it's done.

3176
02:52:42,700 --> 02:52:46,460
Alright, let's get all the professional hunters here.

3177
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:48,480
Let's all kill a kangaroo together.

3178
02:52:48,680 --> 02:52:49,820
One for each of us.

3179
02:52:51,560 --> 02:52:52,320
Let's go.

3180
02:52:54,820 --> 02:52:56,000
Alright, where am I?

3181
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:57,300
Am I in the middle of Australia?

3182
02:52:57,560 --> 02:52:59,000
Where the fuck am I?

3183
02:52:59,180 --> 02:53:00,820
Why am I in the middle of the road?

3184
02:53:01,360 --> 02:53:02,520
Alright, let me turn...

3185
02:53:02,520 --> 02:53:03,820
Make sure there is no...

3186
02:53:03,820 --> 02:53:05,220
There is no push to talk, right?

3187
02:53:05,480 --> 02:53:07,860
I'm making sure there is no push to talk right now.

3188
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:10,660
I know.

3189
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:16,920
There is no VC, right?

3190
02:53:21,490 --> 02:53:22,230
I'll make sure.

3191
02:53:23,130 --> 02:53:25,450
Alright, let's all get together, guys.

3192
02:53:26,090 --> 02:53:26,690
There is only...

3193
02:53:26,690 --> 02:53:27,010
Alright.

3194
02:53:27,610 --> 02:53:30,410
Our mission today is to kill a fucking kangaroo.

3195
02:53:30,750 --> 02:53:31,910
That's our mission.

3196
02:53:37,330 --> 02:53:39,330
John, it's your time to shine.

3197
02:53:39,570 --> 02:53:40,450
Is there PVP?

3198
02:53:40,630 --> 02:53:41,050
I don't know.

3199
02:53:41,110 --> 02:53:41,990
Let's test it out.

3200
02:53:43,570 --> 02:53:44,350
Oh, yeah.

3201
02:53:47,790 --> 02:53:49,030
He is safe.

3202
02:53:49,370 --> 02:53:51,350
He is safe.

3203
02:53:54,530 --> 02:53:55,090
What?

3204
02:53:55,450 --> 02:53:56,990
I had to know.

3205
02:53:57,930 --> 02:54:00,570
Where I was aiming at was just a coincidence.

3206
02:54:01,330 --> 02:54:04,310
Like, where I was aiming at...

3207
02:54:04,310 --> 02:54:04,610
Alright.

3208
02:54:06,450 --> 02:54:07,010
We...

3209
02:54:07,010 --> 02:54:08,450
No, I didn't.

3210
02:54:08,510 --> 02:54:09,390
I don't know what you're talking about.

3211
02:54:11,190 --> 02:54:12,770
Let's kill a kangaroo.

3212
02:54:18,570 --> 02:54:20,210
Look, accidents happen.

3213
02:54:21,350 --> 02:54:22,610
Accidents fucking happen.

3214
02:54:22,730 --> 02:54:23,290
How many people?

3215
02:54:23,390 --> 02:54:23,530
Two?

3216
02:54:23,710 --> 02:54:23,890
Four?

3217
02:54:24,310 --> 02:54:27,330
Why are like half of us on the other side of the map?

3218
02:54:28,350 --> 02:54:29,350
Where do we go?

3219
02:54:29,910 --> 02:54:31,130
Don't you guys have dogs?

3220
02:54:32,810 --> 02:54:33,170
Alright.

3221
02:54:35,650 --> 02:54:38,030
Yeah, it's just a hunting accident, guys.

3222
02:54:38,390 --> 02:54:39,790
Just a little accident.

3223
02:54:42,050 --> 02:54:42,550
Alright.

3224
02:54:44,050 --> 02:54:45,190
Where do we meet up?

3225
02:54:45,190 --> 02:54:48,670
Why is this one guy like 6.11 kilometers away?

3226
02:54:48,930 --> 02:54:50,690
Why is he...

3227
02:54:50,690 --> 02:54:53,270
Oh shit, there's a feral goat somewhere.

3228
02:54:57,810 --> 02:55:00,050
Oh my god, there's feral goats?

3229
02:55:04,710 --> 02:55:05,830
What the fuck?

3230
02:55:05,910 --> 02:55:08,410
There's wild goats here in Australia?

3231
02:55:08,410 --> 02:55:08,610
Australia?

3232
02:55:14,350 --> 02:55:16,190
Wait, mate, it's Australia.

3233
02:55:16,350 --> 02:55:18,330
Of course there's wild goats here.

3234
02:55:18,870 --> 02:55:21,210
Australia does not fuck around.

3235
02:55:21,750 --> 02:55:22,430
Do we have car...

3236
02:55:22,430 --> 02:55:22,670
Okay.

3237
02:55:23,550 --> 02:55:23,930
Alright.

3238
02:55:24,130 --> 02:55:24,910
How many people do we have?

3239
02:55:24,970 --> 02:55:25,310
Three?

3240
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:26,070
Four?

3241
02:55:26,350 --> 02:55:26,830
Five?

3242
02:55:26,990 --> 02:55:27,270
Six?

3243
02:55:27,290 --> 02:55:27,450
Seven?

3244
02:55:27,490 --> 02:55:27,690
Okay.

3245
02:55:28,070 --> 02:55:28,710
We're missing...

3246
02:55:28,710 --> 02:55:30,150
We have one more slot, I think.

3247
02:55:32,610 --> 02:55:33,490
Alright, there we go.

3248
02:55:33,570 --> 02:55:36,330
The psycho killer has joined the session.

3249
02:55:36,770 --> 02:55:37,250
Okay.

3250
02:55:37,250 --> 02:55:38,910
At least we have...

3251
02:55:38,910 --> 02:55:39,190
Okay.

3252
02:55:41,290 --> 02:55:44,390
I don't think I trust that guy over there.

3253
02:55:46,010 --> 02:55:52,830
We have the psycho killer in our fucking squad.

3254
02:55:57,030 --> 02:55:58,550
That's a hell of a team.

3255
02:55:58,910 --> 02:56:02,410
Alright, we can't kill a kangaroo with a fucking psycho killer.

3256
02:56:02,810 --> 02:56:04,290
Oh my god, there's a kangaroo!

3257
02:56:08,320 --> 02:56:10,200
The perfect lobby.

3258
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:16,040
The most normal hunting enthusiast in my hunting game.

3259
02:56:16,940 --> 02:56:18,300
Wait, did we do it?

3260
02:56:18,460 --> 02:56:22,500
Would it be funny if we just got killed by the kangaroo right there?

3261
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:25,520
Bro, I think Vesper's taking the shot.

3262
02:56:26,760 --> 02:56:28,320
Wait, there's another one!

3263
02:56:28,920 --> 02:56:31,680
Bro, are we just gonna kill the kangaroo right off the bat?

3264
02:56:32,620 --> 02:56:33,140
Like...

3265
02:56:33,140 --> 02:56:33,960
Oh my god, look!

3266
02:56:34,200 --> 02:56:35,200
There they are!

3267
02:56:35,460 --> 02:56:36,040
There they are!

3268
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:37,560
Oh my god!

3269
02:56:37,740 --> 02:56:38,900
Go, go, go!

3270
02:56:39,500 --> 02:56:40,420
There they are!

3271
02:56:40,720 --> 02:56:41,500
They're running away!

3272
02:56:44,540 --> 02:56:45,100
Immediate...

3273
02:56:45,100 --> 02:56:45,900
Did we do it?

3274
02:56:46,340 --> 02:56:47,100
Is he dead?

3275
02:56:47,700 --> 02:56:48,940
Vesper, did you get him?

3276
02:56:49,440 --> 02:56:50,460
Did you get him?

3277
02:56:51,680 --> 02:56:53,180
He's right there!

3278
02:57:00,380 --> 02:57:02,380
Vesper, did you get him, Vesper?

3279
02:57:04,820 --> 02:57:06,020
He's on the hunt.

3280
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:07,800
Oh my god, there's another one!

3281
02:57:08,020 --> 02:57:09,460
There's another one right there!

3282
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:10,440
There's so many!

3283
02:57:10,740 --> 02:57:11,540
There's so many!

3284
02:57:11,780 --> 02:57:12,400
There's like...

3285
02:57:12,400 --> 02:57:12,960
They're just...

3286
02:57:12,960 --> 02:57:14,440
They're just like...

3287
02:57:14,440 --> 02:57:16,500
A fucking invasive species right now.

3288
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:17,380
They're like iguanas.

3289
02:57:17,440 --> 02:57:17,980
They're everywhere.

3290
02:57:18,940 --> 02:57:22,380
Oh my god, let's just kill the entire population of kangaroos.

3291
02:57:23,900 --> 02:57:25,000
They're pests.

3292
02:57:25,320 --> 02:57:27,200
They're actual pests right now.

3293
02:57:27,480 --> 02:57:29,480
I hear gunshots around me.

3294
02:57:29,820 --> 02:57:31,100
Oh my god.

3295
02:57:34,520 --> 02:57:36,360
Oh my god.

3296
02:57:36,460 --> 02:57:38,240
Oh my god, we're just shooting all of them.

3297
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:41,340
We each have our own kangaroo kill.

3298
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:44,120
This hunting trip is a success.

3299
02:57:46,440 --> 02:57:48,460
Jesus Christ, just hear...

3300
02:57:52,080 --> 02:57:54,900
Wait, they drowned dogs?!

3301
02:57:55,350 --> 02:57:56,080
What the...

3302
02:57:56,080 --> 02:57:56,760
Wait, what's this?

3303
02:57:57,060 --> 02:57:58,220
Oh wait, that's someone's dog.

3304
02:57:58,320 --> 02:58:01,180
I was like, wait, what's this guy doing here?

3305
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:02,780
Do we do it?

3306
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:04,080
Do we kill him?

3307
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:09,140
What the fuck?

3308
02:58:09,540 --> 02:58:11,280
They can drown that's...

3309
02:58:12,360 --> 02:58:13,080
Dogs?!

3310
02:58:13,080 --> 02:58:14,520
Holy shit.

3311
02:58:16,980 --> 02:58:19,380
Bro, what the fuck is wrong with kangaroos?

3312
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:20,540
Like, actually.

3313
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:22,620
Do we do it, guys?

3314
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,600
No wonder we're hunting kangaroos.

3315
02:58:32,060 --> 02:58:36,640
We're actually about to lose a war on kangaroos like the Aussies did to the rate of birds.

3316
02:58:37,020 --> 02:58:39,000
Thank you for the super chat.

3317
02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:40,480
Thank you, thank you.

3318
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:41,440
Where are they?

3319
02:58:42,260 --> 02:58:44,580
Alright, but also, I want the trophy too.

3320
02:58:44,780 --> 02:58:47,340
I want...

3321
02:58:47,340 --> 02:58:49,820
When we do kill them, I wanna...

3322
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:51,220
I wanna take one of them home.

3323
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:54,400
Wait, someone went on me?

3324
02:58:54,620 --> 02:58:55,600
Oh my god.

3325
02:58:57,400 --> 02:58:58,060
Wait, okay.

3326
02:58:58,140 --> 02:58:59,580
Why are you guys harvesting the kangaroos?

3327
02:58:59,580 --> 02:59:00,460
Kangaroos, guys.

3328
02:59:02,620 --> 02:59:04,560
I see no body.

3329
02:59:05,540 --> 02:59:07,260
I see no body.

3330
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:12,960
It doesn't count if there's no body, guys.

3331
02:59:16,330 --> 02:59:19,070
Okay, does my gun... can my gun kill a kangaroo?

3332
02:59:19,910 --> 02:59:20,850
It can't, right?

3333
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:23,290
I think I need an actual gun.

3334
02:59:25,590 --> 02:59:26,890
Can I use somebody else's gun?

3335
02:59:29,410 --> 02:59:29,970
No.

3336
02:59:30,670 --> 02:59:33,230
Wait, I wanna see a dead kangaroo real quick, guys.

3337
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:39,320
Alright, is that him?

3338
02:59:41,340 --> 02:59:42,360
Alright, everybody.

3339
02:59:43,140 --> 02:59:43,980
Gather around.

3340
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:46,580
Gather around.

3341
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:50,980
Wait, I can't...

3342
02:59:50,980 --> 02:59:52,200
Gather around, everyone.

3343
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:56,480
Gather around to this dead kangaroo that I killed.

3344
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:01,580
I killed... I killed this kangaroo, everyone.

3345
03:00:01,580 --> 03:00:06,260
As you can see, this is my kangaroo kill right here.

3346
03:00:06,900 --> 03:00:10,140
And you can tell it's mine because... wait, where did you...

3347
03:00:10,140 --> 03:00:12,580
You can tell it's mine because...

3348
03:00:14,480 --> 03:00:16,040
I saved the harvest.

3349
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:21,400
Thank you, everyone.

3350
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:22,620
Thank you.

3351
03:00:22,760 --> 03:00:23,700
Thank you, everybody.

3352
03:00:23,960 --> 03:00:24,540
Thank you.

3353
03:00:24,660 --> 03:00:25,920
I know, I took the shot.

3354
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:26,560
Alright.

3355
03:00:30,020 --> 03:00:34,760
Thank you, everyone, for watching me kill this kangaroo.

3356
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:38,800
Oh, you wanna take a picture?

3357
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:39,980
Oh, okay, let's go.

3358
03:00:40,060 --> 03:00:40,740
I'll kill another one.

3359
03:00:40,840 --> 03:00:41,160
Don't worry.

3360
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:42,080
Don't worry.

3361
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:43,120
Don't worry.

3362
03:00:43,360 --> 03:00:44,580
I'll kill another one.

3363
03:00:45,660 --> 03:00:46,500
Let's go.

3364
03:00:46,760 --> 03:00:49,560
Let's find another kangaroo.

3365
03:00:50,560 --> 03:00:52,680
And we can take a picture.

3366
03:00:53,120 --> 03:00:53,760
Don't worry.

3367
03:00:53,860 --> 03:00:55,120
Let's find another one, guys.

3368
03:00:55,120 --> 03:00:56,220
Let's...

3369
03:00:56,220 --> 03:00:57,300
Wait, are there koalas?

3370
03:00:58,540 --> 03:01:00,340
Is there koalas in this map?

3371
03:01:01,240 --> 03:01:03,200
Can we shoot...

3372
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:05,260
Can we shoot a koala?

3373
03:01:12,760 --> 03:01:15,400
Find the koalas, please.

3374
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:19,780
That's what they said about the bisons, too.

3375
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:22,220
Look, this is my nature reserve.

3376
03:01:23,260 --> 03:01:24,440
Oh, there's another kangaroo.

3377
03:01:24,820 --> 03:01:25,780
Oh, there's more.

3378
03:01:26,820 --> 03:01:27,320
No, I meant...

3379
03:01:27,320 --> 03:01:28,320
Sorry, I meant the drop bears.

3380
03:01:32,760 --> 03:01:34,020
I meant the drop bears, guys.

3381
03:01:34,260 --> 03:01:35,600
Drop bears are free reign.

3382
03:01:40,080 --> 03:01:42,660
Okay, Australia have like multiple problems.

3383
03:01:43,520 --> 03:01:44,380
It's not just...

3384
03:01:44,380 --> 03:01:45,260
Wait, what the fuck?

3385
03:01:46,580 --> 03:01:48,100
Oh, it's a feed zone.

3386
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:50,600
Oh my god, we're just shooting.

3387
03:01:55,630 --> 03:01:58,650
Guys, I think my golden retriever might be useless.

3388
03:01:59,410 --> 03:02:01,170
Why does everybody have...

3389
03:02:01,170 --> 03:02:05,870
I like how everyone has bloodhounds and then mine is just...

3390
03:02:05,870 --> 03:02:07,070
Mine's a golden retriever.

3391
03:02:07,490 --> 03:02:08,430
He's just there.

3392
03:02:08,850 --> 03:02:09,610
He's there.

3393
03:02:11,590 --> 03:02:13,050
Don't worry, I'm helping.

3394
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:19,140
Don't worry, guys.

3395
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:19,800
I'm helping.

3396
03:02:20,560 --> 03:02:21,400
I'm heading over.

3397
03:02:21,560 --> 03:02:22,360
I took a shot.

3398
03:02:22,820 --> 03:02:23,460
See, look.

3399
03:02:24,560 --> 03:02:25,480
Look at that.

3400
03:02:25,540 --> 03:02:26,100
I'm helping.

3401
03:02:28,220 --> 03:02:29,500
I got you guys.

3402
03:02:31,640 --> 03:02:34,180
Golden retrievers are just good boy.

3403
03:02:34,900 --> 03:02:36,160
It is what...

3404
03:02:36,160 --> 03:02:45,460
Me, John, Cryowolf, Dragon, Ninetales, Big, and PsychoKiller172.

3405
03:02:45,870 --> 03:02:46,960
The real squad.

3406
03:02:48,380 --> 03:02:49,880
I'm suppressing fire.

3407
03:02:51,060 --> 03:02:53,120
Careful, the koalas are dangerous.

3408
03:02:53,240 --> 03:02:54,200
They have chlamydia.

3409
03:02:54,300 --> 03:02:55,340
Oh yeah, they do.

3410
03:02:55,940 --> 03:02:58,180
They have chlamydia and they also have like...

3411
03:02:59,720 --> 03:03:02,900
The food they're eating is actually not good for them.

3412
03:03:05,340 --> 03:03:06,700
Oh, you guys didn't know that?

3413
03:03:06,860 --> 03:03:07,240
Yeah.

3414
03:03:09,180 --> 03:03:10,820
All koalas have chlamydia.

3415
03:03:14,040 --> 03:03:15,040
Did we do it?

3416
03:03:15,820 --> 03:03:16,500
Where are they?

3417
03:03:20,460 --> 03:03:23,160
Yeah, they were just like born that way, I guess.

3418
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:27,120
You guys didn't know that?

3419
03:03:27,320 --> 03:03:27,660
Yeah.

3420
03:03:28,480 --> 03:03:32,300
And then eucalyptus leaves actually just make them like incredibly high.

3421
03:03:35,920 --> 03:03:39,520
So they're like high and also have chlamydia all the time.

3422
03:03:45,900 --> 03:03:47,560
Where the fuck are the kangaroos?

3423
03:03:54,420 --> 03:03:55,860
Yeah, it's why they sleep all day.

3424
03:03:55,960 --> 03:03:57,760
They're literally just high all the time.

3425
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:02,180
You know what?

3426
03:04:02,300 --> 03:04:03,900
I think if I know anybody...

3427
03:04:03,900 --> 03:04:04,720
Yeah, I was gonna say...

3428
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:05,920
I was gonna say if I...

3429
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:10,740
If I know anyone that's gonna have a kangaroo, it's gonna be PsychoKiller.

3430
03:04:10,740 --> 03:04:11,780
I was like...

3431
03:04:12,760 --> 03:04:18,760
I was like, I'm pretty sure PsychoKiller found a fucking...

3432
03:04:18,760 --> 03:04:20,240
Got killed a kangaroo.

3433
03:04:21,980 --> 03:04:23,100
All right, guys.

3434
03:04:23,420 --> 03:04:24,920
I did it, everybody.

3435
03:04:25,060 --> 03:04:26,500
I killed another kangaroo.

3436
03:04:26,780 --> 03:04:27,140
Look.

3437
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:28,580
Guys.

3438
03:04:28,700 --> 03:04:29,600
Okay, everyone.

3439
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:31,160
Everyone.

3440
03:04:31,660 --> 03:04:32,660
He's still moving.

3441
03:04:32,840 --> 03:04:34,660
So I have to shoot him again, guys.

3442
03:04:35,880 --> 03:04:36,780
Guys, look.

3443
03:04:36,840 --> 03:04:37,100
Okay.

3444
03:04:37,620 --> 03:04:38,960
As you all see.

3445
03:04:39,620 --> 03:04:41,920
I killed this kangaroo.

3446
03:04:42,300 --> 03:04:44,260
It was still moving.

3447
03:04:45,900 --> 03:04:47,100
It was...

3448
03:04:47,100 --> 03:04:49,120
It was still moving.

3449
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:53,120
So I had to make sure he was dead dead.

3450
03:04:53,220 --> 03:04:53,880
Okay, look.

3451
03:04:53,960 --> 03:04:56,820
See, I shot him right there on the tail.

3452
03:04:59,420 --> 03:05:00,320
All right, everyone.

3453
03:05:01,220 --> 03:05:02,680
All right, take a photo, everybody.

3454
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:06,860
Take a photo of this kangaroo that I got right here.

3455
03:05:06,860 --> 03:05:09,040
All right, who's taking a photo?

3456
03:05:10,340 --> 03:05:12,660
Take a photo of my kill.

3457
03:05:16,860 --> 03:05:18,540
All right, is anyone...

3458
03:05:18,540 --> 03:05:19,800
All right, are you guys taking a photo?

3459
03:05:20,560 --> 03:05:20,840
Yeah?

3460
03:05:23,780 --> 03:05:25,240
I did it, guys.

3461
03:05:25,500 --> 03:05:26,500
I did it.

3462
03:05:27,340 --> 03:05:29,000
Me and my kangaroo.

3463
03:05:30,960 --> 03:05:32,920
All right, everybody got a photo?

3464
03:05:34,120 --> 03:05:34,700
Okay.

3465
03:05:35,220 --> 03:05:36,300
All right, nice.

3466
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:38,780
Now, let me claim my trophy that I clearly got.

3467
03:05:42,440 --> 03:05:43,260
All right.

3468
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:47,740
Thank you for watching me hunt a kangaroo.

3469
03:05:53,880 --> 03:05:55,200
All right.

3470
03:05:55,440 --> 03:06:00,240
Can we visit other people's lodges?

3471
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:03,920
Guys, is it possible to visit other people's lodges?

3472
03:06:04,900 --> 03:06:05,800
Or no?

3473
03:06:06,140 --> 03:06:07,720
Yeah, twice even, guys.

3474
03:06:07,820 --> 03:06:08,860
I did it twice.

3475
03:06:11,060 --> 03:06:13,180
Exactly like those rich people.

3476
03:06:16,260 --> 03:06:17,080
What do you mean?

3477
03:06:17,300 --> 03:06:19,000
I did it, guys.

3478
03:06:19,500 --> 03:06:20,460
I did it.

3479
03:06:20,700 --> 03:06:21,340
Wait, you can?

3480
03:06:22,100 --> 03:06:22,660
All right.

3481
03:06:22,860 --> 03:06:24,100
Who has the best lodge?

3482
03:06:26,180 --> 03:06:28,340
Who has the best lodge?

3483
03:06:29,740 --> 03:06:31,200
Actually, I want to visit...

3484
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:37,420
Like, I want to visit Psycho Killer's lodge.

3485
03:06:41,240 --> 03:06:44,100
I want to know what he's hiding down there.

3486
03:06:45,780 --> 03:06:51,260
I want to know what Psycho Killer has in his fucking lodge.

3487
03:06:52,920 --> 03:06:57,400
If it isn't Psycho, I'd go there and call...

3488
03:06:57,400 --> 03:07:00,620
Sorry, can't show you the basement.

3489
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:02,000
Come on.

3490
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:04,640
Show us your lodge, Psycho Killer.

3491
03:07:05,280 --> 03:07:07,740
What's in the basement?

3492
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:12,880
What's in the fucking basement?

3493
03:07:14,560 --> 03:07:15,140
All right.

3494
03:07:15,200 --> 03:07:15,660
No, no, no.

3495
03:07:15,800 --> 03:07:17,520
Let's look at Psycho Killer's first.

3496
03:07:18,180 --> 03:07:20,560
He looks like he has something he's hiding.

3497
03:07:25,020 --> 03:07:28,200
He definitely looks like he's hiding something.

3498
03:07:34,180 --> 03:07:37,200
Dude, he has something to hide.

3499
03:07:37,220 --> 03:07:38,340
He is running.

3500
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:45,000
Matt's running around with shotguns after K- Wait, did he kill a kangaroo with a fucking shotgun?

3501
03:07:45,580 --> 03:07:47,340
Holy fucking shit.

3502
03:07:48,300 --> 03:07:49,580
Jesus Christ.

3503
03:07:50,140 --> 03:07:50,540
All right.

3504
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:54,480
Okay, maybe these guys are scarier than I expected, guys.

3505
03:07:58,140 --> 03:08:00,680
He wants to tidy up.

3506
03:08:00,680 --> 03:08:02,420
He wants to tidy it up.

3507
03:08:02,480 --> 03:08:04,580
Wait, how do you visit other people's lodges now?

3508
03:08:06,180 --> 03:08:07,920
How do you visit other people's lodges?

3509
03:08:12,640 --> 03:08:13,840
How do we do it?

3510
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:18,680
Oh my god, the Pharaoh.

3511
03:08:18,840 --> 03:08:19,600
That poor goat.

3512
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:22,640
That poor fucking goat.

3513
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:29,120
How does that work, guys?

3514
03:08:31,940 --> 03:08:33,700
I want to go visit a lodge.

3515
03:08:33,900 --> 03:08:35,100
I want to visit someone else.

3516
03:08:35,540 --> 03:08:36,340
God, a goat.

3517
03:08:36,740 --> 03:08:37,220
Okay.

3518
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:44,740
He just randomly- Oh, they have to host it as a server.

3519
03:08:44,920 --> 03:08:45,480
All right, guys.

3520
03:08:46,080 --> 03:08:47,660
Who is hosting it?

3521
03:08:48,560 --> 03:08:50,020
Oh, I'm hosting my lodge?

3522
03:08:50,100 --> 03:08:50,920
All right, guys.

3523
03:08:52,700 --> 03:08:54,880
All right, let's go to John's lodge then.

3524
03:08:56,320 --> 03:08:59,100
Oh, Big Bishi- Okay, let's go to Big Bishi and meet him.

3525
03:08:59,980 --> 03:09:01,320
I'm going to that one.

3526
03:09:01,880 --> 03:09:03,000
They hosted it.

3527
03:09:03,080 --> 03:09:04,140
He chased it down.

3528
03:09:04,260 --> 03:09:05,800
All right, I'll see you guys at his lodge, guys.

3529
03:09:05,900 --> 03:09:07,120
Party at his lodge, everybody.

3530
03:09:07,720 --> 03:09:09,560
Party at Big Bishi-man's lodge.

3531
03:09:10,780 --> 03:09:12,700
What a fucking sentence.

3532
03:09:13,140 --> 03:09:15,000
We're partying over there, guys.

3533
03:09:16,400 --> 03:09:18,100
To the lodge we go.

3534
03:09:19,260 --> 03:09:19,760
All right.

3535
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:23,560
No party like a lodge party.

3536
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:24,100
Let's see.

3537
03:09:24,180 --> 03:09:25,100
Let's see this.

3538
03:09:26,100 --> 03:09:26,600
Let's see.

3539
03:09:27,600 --> 03:09:28,360
All right.

3540
03:09:28,360 --> 03:09:29,020
Oh, wait, no.

3541
03:09:29,500 --> 03:09:29,980
Multiplayer.

3542
03:09:31,420 --> 03:09:32,780
How do I find lodges?

3543
03:09:36,020 --> 03:09:37,920
Wait, how do you find lodges?

3544
03:09:38,020 --> 03:09:38,260
Okay.

3545
03:09:40,820 --> 03:09:41,860
Big Worldwide.

3546
03:09:44,580 --> 03:09:47,100
I'm trying to find server.

3547
03:09:48,400 --> 03:09:49,580
Oh, there it is.

3548
03:09:50,040 --> 03:09:51,000
I found it.

3549
03:09:53,540 --> 03:09:54,160
All right, guys.

3550
03:09:54,240 --> 03:09:55,520
Party at his lodge, everybody.

3551
03:09:55,520 --> 03:09:56,900
I found it.

3552
03:10:00,450 --> 03:10:03,150
I'm sad we never got to see Psycho Killer's lodge.

3553
03:10:04,250 --> 03:10:06,070
I want to know what's in it.

3554
03:10:06,670 --> 03:10:07,150
Whoa.

3555
03:10:10,050 --> 03:10:11,450
Oh, my God.

3556
03:10:11,750 --> 03:10:13,330
Hey, that's the fox I killed, too.

3557
03:10:14,570 --> 03:10:15,050
Whoa.

3558
03:10:17,630 --> 03:10:18,610
Oh, my God.

3559
03:10:18,650 --> 03:10:19,750
This man's been hunting.

3560
03:10:20,270 --> 03:10:20,590
Oh, my God.

3561
03:10:20,590 --> 03:10:21,510
He got a boar.

3562
03:10:25,250 --> 03:10:26,290
He got a boar.

3563
03:10:26,390 --> 03:10:27,690
He got some deers.

3564
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:30,730
Man, that's a nice-ass lodge.

3565
03:10:33,630 --> 03:10:35,190
Why am I holding a phone like this?

3566
03:10:35,570 --> 03:10:36,170
What is this?

3567
03:10:36,670 --> 03:10:38,410
The Rocky Mountain Elk.

3568
03:10:38,490 --> 03:10:38,910
Oh, my God.

3569
03:10:38,950 --> 03:10:40,070
He has all the ducks, too.

3570
03:10:40,750 --> 03:10:42,590
Oh, not the Canadian geese, though.

3571
03:10:42,790 --> 03:10:43,150
Mallard.

3572
03:10:43,330 --> 03:10:43,690
Mallard.

3573
03:10:43,790 --> 03:10:45,230
Yeah, where's the Canadian geese, bro?

3574
03:10:46,410 --> 03:10:48,030
Oh, look at all the deers he killed.

3575
03:10:48,410 --> 03:10:49,110
Oh, my God.

3576
03:10:49,110 --> 03:10:50,370
There's a turkey, too.

3577
03:10:51,030 --> 03:10:52,650
He has an eastern wild turkey.

3578
03:10:57,320 --> 03:10:58,360
All right, there's...

3579
03:10:58,360 --> 03:10:58,960
Oh, my God.

3580
03:10:58,960 --> 03:11:00,540
He got, like, a mountain lion.

3581
03:11:00,680 --> 03:11:01,120
A puma.

3582
03:11:02,840 --> 03:11:04,280
And a red deer.

3583
03:11:04,940 --> 03:11:05,760
What the fuck?

3584
03:11:05,780 --> 03:11:06,640
You can hunt lions?

3585
03:11:08,260 --> 03:11:09,760
Oh, my God.

3586
03:11:10,020 --> 03:11:11,180
Wait, he got a lion.

3587
03:11:12,040 --> 03:11:13,800
He's got a lion in here.

3588
03:11:15,040 --> 03:11:16,640
And a fucking grizzly bear.

3589
03:11:16,820 --> 03:11:17,960
Bro, this man's rich.

3590
03:11:18,200 --> 03:11:19,860
This man's rich-rich.

3591
03:11:20,880 --> 03:11:22,480
Whoa, Simba died.

3592
03:11:25,080 --> 03:11:27,180
Okay, but did he get a...

3593
03:11:27,180 --> 03:11:30,120
Okay, but did he get the caribou?

3594
03:11:30,200 --> 03:11:31,260
Okay, he got the bison.

3595
03:11:31,420 --> 03:11:32,100
Never mind.

3596
03:11:34,240 --> 03:11:35,400
That's the wild turkey.

3597
03:11:35,460 --> 03:11:36,540
Why do you have two turkeys?

3598
03:11:38,480 --> 03:11:39,820
Then he has the bison.

3599
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:40,540
Look at that.

3600
03:11:40,660 --> 03:11:40,860
See?

3601
03:11:41,140 --> 03:11:43,400
He hunted the bison, too, guys.

3602
03:11:43,520 --> 03:11:44,580
Wait, what about kangaroos?

3603
03:11:45,100 --> 03:11:46,260
Where's your kangaroos?

3604
03:11:50,940 --> 03:11:52,340
Where's your kangaroo, buddy?

3605
03:11:53,280 --> 03:11:55,080
The mythical caribou.

3606
03:11:55,360 --> 03:11:57,320
All right, but where is this caribou, huh?

3607
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:00,380
But does he have...

3608
03:12:00,380 --> 03:12:02,420
Does he have a caribou, though?

3609
03:12:02,600 --> 03:12:03,820
Not a real gamer.

3610
03:12:04,440 --> 03:12:05,240
Doesn't even...

3611
03:12:05,240 --> 03:12:06,860
Oh my god, wait, they have albinos?

3612
03:12:07,660 --> 03:12:08,020
Wait.

3613
03:12:08,460 --> 03:12:10,040
They exist in this game?

3614
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:11,120
They're real?

3615
03:12:12,040 --> 03:12:14,540
Why does he have, like, 300 mooses?

3616
03:12:16,300 --> 03:12:16,780
Like...

3617
03:12:17,740 --> 03:12:19,900
Yeah, but where's your caribou, though?

3618
03:12:26,380 --> 03:12:27,100
A shiny...

3619
03:12:27,100 --> 03:12:28,700
Oh my god, he got a shiny.

3620
03:12:32,180 --> 03:12:33,080
You know what?

3621
03:12:33,240 --> 03:12:34,580
I'm not as impressed.

3622
03:12:34,780 --> 03:12:36,300
There's no caribous in here.

3623
03:12:38,080 --> 03:12:38,880
Sorry, but...

3624
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:39,580
Oh wait, never mind.

3625
03:12:44,270 --> 03:12:45,970
Never mind, I'm impressed now.

3626
03:12:46,090 --> 03:12:46,890
Okay, never mind.

3627
03:12:47,050 --> 03:12:48,270
I found your caribou.

3628
03:12:48,650 --> 03:12:51,310
I found two of your caribous.

3629
03:12:51,410 --> 03:12:51,990
Never mind.

3630
03:12:53,690 --> 03:12:55,290
He hunted 4,000.

3631
03:12:55,350 --> 03:12:56,230
Oh my god.

3632
03:12:56,510 --> 03:12:58,410
Bro, he got a shiny moose!

3633
03:12:59,350 --> 03:13:01,870
Oh my god, the caribou room.

3634
03:13:01,870 --> 03:13:03,190
Wait, that's...

3635
03:13:03,190 --> 03:13:05,590
I didn't realize you can hunt shinies in here.

3636
03:13:06,130 --> 03:13:07,170
Oh my god.

3637
03:13:07,530 --> 03:13:08,350
Bro is...

3638
03:13:08,350 --> 03:13:10,030
Bro, this man's rich, bro.

3639
03:13:10,550 --> 03:13:11,850
This man's rich rich.

3640
03:13:13,170 --> 03:13:15,670
Bro was lost in his own home.

3641
03:13:16,110 --> 03:13:18,030
Why is there so many moose?

3642
03:13:21,900 --> 03:13:23,480
Wait, do you have a shiny lion?

3643
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:25,040
Do you have any other shinies?

3644
03:13:25,620 --> 03:13:27,320
Did you catch any other ones?

3645
03:13:28,740 --> 03:13:30,720
Any other shiny animal?

3646
03:13:32,820 --> 03:13:34,260
Or is it just the moose?

3647
03:13:34,900 --> 03:13:36,120
Or the caribou?

3648
03:13:38,980 --> 03:13:39,620
Do you have any other...

3649
03:13:39,620 --> 03:13:40,980
No shiny lion yet.

3650
03:13:41,160 --> 03:13:42,540
Oh yeah.

3651
03:13:43,560 --> 03:13:45,160
Wait, he played this game for 6 years?

3652
03:13:45,200 --> 03:13:45,680
Jesus.

3653
03:13:46,160 --> 03:13:47,120
Oh my god.

3654
03:13:47,200 --> 03:13:47,580
See guys?

3655
03:13:48,260 --> 03:13:48,780
Um...

3656
03:13:48,780 --> 03:13:49,420
See guys?

3657
03:13:49,520 --> 03:13:50,460
I'm not bad.

3658
03:13:50,540 --> 03:13:51,180
I'm just inexperienced.

3659
03:13:57,220 --> 03:13:57,740
Look.

3660
03:13:58,920 --> 03:14:00,280
I'm not bad.

3661
03:14:00,500 --> 03:14:01,340
I'm just inexperienced.

3662
03:14:01,340 --> 03:14:02,620
I'm just inexperienced guys.

3663
03:14:02,740 --> 03:14:05,240
I just didn't play this game for 6 years.

3664
03:14:05,400 --> 03:14:05,580
Okay?

3665
03:14:05,960 --> 03:14:07,340
That's different.

3666
03:14:13,460 --> 03:14:15,120
That was fun.

3667
03:14:15,240 --> 03:14:16,240
I had a fun time.

3668
03:14:16,560 --> 03:14:17,900
I hope you guys had fun watching.

3669
03:14:18,400 --> 03:14:19,480
Watch me...

3670
03:14:20,260 --> 03:14:25,520
Try and fucking kill a stupid animal for 3 hours.

3671
03:14:30,040 --> 03:14:30,600
Look.

3672
03:14:30,980 --> 03:14:32,800
I did kill 3 things.

3673
03:14:33,060 --> 03:14:34,080
4 things.

3674
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:34,840
5.

3675
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:35,340
5.

3676
03:14:35,340 --> 03:14:36,980
Including the kangaroo.

3677
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:38,920
2 kangaroos that I killed guys.

3678
03:14:39,320 --> 03:14:43,460
I did kill 5 things within 3 hours.

3679
03:14:43,580 --> 03:14:43,840
Okay?

3680
03:14:44,860 --> 03:14:47,260
And I call that an accomplishment.

3681
03:14:47,540 --> 03:14:48,220
I had fun.

3682
03:14:48,320 --> 03:14:48,800
I had fun.

3683
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:49,720
And...

3684
03:14:49,720 --> 03:14:50,200
I had fun.

3685
03:14:50,560 --> 03:14:51,820
Yeah, we all gotta start somewhere.

3686
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:52,280
Right?

3687
03:14:52,500 --> 03:14:53,820
We all gotta...

3688
03:14:53,820 --> 03:14:54,360
Yeah.

3689
03:14:54,640 --> 03:14:55,500
I mean, I do it.

3690
03:14:55,500 --> 03:14:56,480
I do have them.

3691
03:14:56,720 --> 03:14:58,100
I have the kangaroo.

3692
03:14:58,460 --> 03:14:58,720
Okay?

3693
03:14:59,320 --> 03:15:00,120
I mean, I do.

3694
03:15:00,240 --> 03:15:00,400
Look.

3695
03:15:00,500 --> 03:15:00,680
See?

3696
03:15:01,540 --> 03:15:02,500
I have...

3697
03:15:02,500 --> 03:15:02,760
Wait.

3698
03:15:02,880 --> 03:15:03,420
Look at that.

3699
03:15:04,060 --> 03:15:05,960
The eastern gray kangaroo.

3700
03:15:06,160 --> 03:15:06,680
Look at that.

3701
03:15:06,800 --> 03:15:07,780
That I own.

3702
03:15:08,240 --> 03:15:08,500
See?

3703
03:15:08,860 --> 03:15:10,360
I own that guy.

3704
03:15:16,660 --> 03:15:17,140
But...

3705
03:15:17,140 --> 03:15:18,000
I'm gonna call it here.

3706
03:15:18,180 --> 03:15:19,440
We do have another stream tonight.

3707
03:15:19,820 --> 03:15:20,300
At...

3708
03:15:20,300 --> 03:15:21,300
In 2 hours.

3709
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:22,980
So, I'm gonna call it here.

3710
03:15:23,080 --> 03:15:24,240
I hope you guys had fun watching.

3711
03:15:24,300 --> 03:15:25,160
Me play the...

3712
03:15:25,160 --> 03:15:25,480
The...

3713
03:15:26,560 --> 03:15:29,780
And trying to track the animals today.

3714
03:15:30,560 --> 03:15:32,180
But I hope you guys all had fun watching.

3715
03:15:32,460 --> 03:15:33,480
As always, everybody...

3716
03:15:34,620 --> 03:15:35,340
Stay hydrated.

3717
03:15:35,800 --> 03:15:36,400
Posture check.

3718
03:15:36,700 --> 03:15:38,460
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3719
03:15:38,600 --> 03:15:39,500
And if you stay up for me...

3720
03:15:40,040 --> 03:15:40,680
Head to bed.

3721
03:15:41,100 --> 03:15:41,460
Cause...

3722
03:15:41,460 --> 03:15:42,120
You deserve it.

3723
03:15:42,140 --> 03:15:43,480
Or stay up for Goodnight Dragons.

3724
03:15:43,580 --> 03:15:44,320
I'll see you guys there.

3725
03:15:44,560 --> 03:15:46,300
I usually do, like, an after stream talk.

3726
03:15:46,380 --> 03:15:47,500
Cause I've been feeling...

3727
03:15:47,500 --> 03:15:48,860
I've been feeling good lately.

3728
03:15:49,220 --> 03:15:49,960
So, like, my...

3729
03:15:49,960 --> 03:15:51,360
Well, my voice is not, like...

3730
03:15:51,360 --> 03:15:51,860
The...

3731
03:15:51,860 --> 03:15:54,300
My voice is, like, not fully recovered.

3732
03:15:54,300 --> 03:15:56,120
Since it's still, like, a bit scratchy.

3733
03:15:57,220 --> 03:15:57,620
But...

3734
03:15:58,140 --> 03:15:58,540
But...

3735
03:15:58,540 --> 03:15:59,280
Um...

3736
03:15:59,280 --> 03:16:00,400
I'm feeling a lot better.

3737
03:16:00,940 --> 03:16:01,340
So...

3738
03:16:01,800 --> 03:16:02,200
Um...

3739
03:16:02,200 --> 03:16:02,620
Um...

3740
03:16:02,620 --> 03:16:04,480
But, because we do have another stream tonight...

3741
03:16:04,480 --> 03:16:05,920
I'm gonna do, like...

3742
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:07,960
I'm just gonna push the after stream talk over there.

3743
03:16:08,280 --> 03:16:09,240
Anyway, guys...

3744
03:16:09,240 --> 03:16:10,340
As always, everybody...

3745
03:16:10,340 --> 03:16:10,900
Stay hydrated.

3746
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:11,560
Posture check.

3747
03:16:11,600 --> 03:16:13,120
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3748
03:16:13,220 --> 03:16:14,320
And if you stay up for me...

3749
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:14,880
Head to bed.

3750
03:16:15,020 --> 03:16:15,420
Cause...

3751
03:16:15,420 --> 03:16:16,140
You deserve it.

3752
03:16:16,360 --> 03:16:17,760
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3753
03:16:18,140 --> 03:16:18,760
Bye, guys.

3754
03:16:19,160 --> 03:16:19,560
Bye!
