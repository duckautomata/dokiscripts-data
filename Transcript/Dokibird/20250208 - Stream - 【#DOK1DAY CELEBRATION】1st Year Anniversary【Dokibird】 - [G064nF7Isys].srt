00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,870
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,130
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,910
Um, I don't know why I feel so nervous, even though, like, I sort of, you know, the video's over already.

4
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,970
But it's like, it's my first year anniversary!

5
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,650
For, like, the third time!

6
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,810
How many anniversaries does she need?!

7
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,810
How many first-year anniversaries does she have?!

8
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,770
Thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you!

9
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,090
Happy Jiro day, Doki, and also y'all Dragoons!

10
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,910
Thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you!

11
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:40,670
Yes, you're sitting here with me today, because it's not only my anniversary, it is also your anniversary, too.

12
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,050
To be fair, we do have a Dragoon day, but, like, it's alright.

13
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:52,610
We have two, and the next, and then, like, this is next week, and next week is Dad's birthday, too.

14
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,370
So, it's not Valentine's Day, it's more important than that.

15
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,150
It's Doki Amber Doge's, um, um, birthday as well next week.

16
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,110
Sorry, my throat is dying.

17
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,950
Um, yesterday I couldn't talk at all.

18
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:14,970
Like, I am really nervous, because, like, I'm, like, really paranoid that I'm gonna go through the three-month period of, like, coughing again.

19
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,430
So, I'm, like, really paranoid right now about that shit.

20
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,610
But, like, yesterday I had to rest a lot, because I legitimately couldn't talk at all yesterday.

21
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,110
So, I hope today will be okay for me.

22
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,450
I hope, I hope I'll be okay today.

23
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,510
Um, um, Joel, thank you for the Akasupa!

24
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,990
Thank you, thank you!

25
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,670
Anniversary Akasupa!

26
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,950
Happy anniversary from this, um, UFO Dragoon!

27
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,450
Thanks Doki and Mint for the song!

28
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,190
For another 365 days!

29
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,950
Thank you, thank you for the Akasupa!

30
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,770
Thank you, thank you!

31
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,510
I really appreciate it, guys.

32
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,510
Thank you all so much for the superchats, everybody.

33
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,010
Um, yeah, I know I was like, guys, don't...

34
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,690
Uh, guys, I don't know if I have anything to reveal.

35
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,050
I was so busy the last couple of...

36
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,210
Not even the last couple of months.

37
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,430
The last year?

38
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,270
I feel like I've been non-stop.

39
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,230
Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.

40
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,210
And then, like, I went on vacation.

41
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,350
And I went to Japan.

42
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,710
Cause I was like, I need a break.

43
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,330
And then, like, so then I was like, I'm not gonna think about the anniversary.

44
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,890
Even though technically I had nothing planned for the anniversary.

45
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,930
Just a huge shoutout to the music video team.

46
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,150
Um, for finishing it up in time for the anniversary.

47
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,270
Um, they worked incredibly hard to make sure it was done by today.

48
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,590
Um, this has been in the works for a while.

49
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,030
As you guys know, it was shown in our very first concert.

50
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,790
Um, at AnyRevel.

51
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,130
And, um, the team has been working incredibly hard.

52
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,270
It was actually originally slated for a Christmas release.

53
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,870
This was gonna be a video that was gonna play on Christmas.

54
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,690
Uh, but obviously there were some delays for it.

55
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,590
Uh, in a way where, like, we couldn't, uh, have it out by Christmas.

56
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,850
Um, and that was the thing I had planned.

57
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,170
That was the video that I had planned for Christmas.

58
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,610
But luckily, we were able to make it in time for the anniversary.

59
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,230
I was like, oh thank God, I do have something to show.

60
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:19,950
Like...

61
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,190
I do, I do have something to show to people.

62
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,950
But I do have a couple of announcements.

63
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,590
A couple, I'm really sorry for your wallets.

64
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,250
Um, I'll be straight up right now.

65
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,430
This might not be a good month for the Dragoons wallets.

66
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,370
But to be fair, I didn't have a lot of merch coming out in a while.

67
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,810
So, like, you guys must have saved some money, right?

68
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,090
For this exact moment, you know?

69
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,090
For this...

70
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,150
For this moment, right guys?

71
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,790
You guys must have saved the money.

72
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,950
About all the merch I didn't release.

73
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,530
For this exact moment, right guys?

74
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,150
Right?

75
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,030
No...

76
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,730
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,110
I'm sorry, guys.

78
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,810
Alright, thank you for the Akasupa.

79
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,890
Thank you, thank you.

80
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,270
Happy anniversary, Doki.

81
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,670
Here's a hongbao for my forever Kamiyoshi.

82
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,770
I can't believe a year has come and gone.

83
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,070
I'm so proud of everything you've done this past year.

84
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,310
I'm looking forward to many more.

85
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,410
We'll always be by your side no matter what.

86
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,930
Thank you for your Akasupa.

87
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,950
Thank you, thank you.

88
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,170
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

89
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,270
Thank you, thank you.

90
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,030
Also, um...

91
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,950
Let me, uh...

92
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,890
Let me screenshot.

93
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:38,890
I'm gonna screenshot from the video the credits for all the people who worked incredibly hard on the...

94
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,010
I do have a couple of announcements as we go along.

95
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,510
There are a couple of announcements.

96
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,970
A couple of merch announcements.

97
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,550
A couple of other stuff announcements.

98
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,950
So, like, don't go because there's a lot of stuff to talk about.

99
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,590
And then you guys are like, Doki, you fucking liar.

100
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,250
You said there was nothing.

101
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,790
Okay, I do have some stuff, okay, guys?

102
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,750
Doesn't mean I have nothing.

103
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,650
I do have some things to show you guys.

104
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,670
I just didn't go all out.

105
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,930
Like, I, you know, I didn't have time.

106
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,250
I had too many things going on.

107
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,390
Too many fires to put out.

108
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,130
So, I couldn't actually go all out.

109
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,310
So, like, this is me going, like, um...

110
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,230
Going average.

111
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,710
Like...

112
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:30,170
This is me going average instead of going all out.

113
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,050
So, um, anyway.

114
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,550
Um, because it's gonna be launching in literally eight minutes.

115
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:42,470
I will show you guys the very first merchandise drop for my anniversary.

116
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,890
So, um, well, okay.

117
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,790
Sorry, I don't know why I'm super nervous.

118
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,590
It's like...

119
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,370
I don't know why.

120
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,410
I've been doing this for so long.

121
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,410
And I'm still like...

122
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,730
I don't know.

123
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,770
I still have butterflies in my stomach for some reason.

124
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,410
I don't know.

125
00:07:59,550 --> 00:07:59,830
Anyway.

126
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,750
Oh, my God.

127
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,090
Okay.

128
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:01,890
Wow.

129
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,490
All right.

130
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,070
Let me grab the image.

131
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:04,430
All right.

132
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,530
I'm sorry, Dragoon.

133
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,990
We're gonna cover you up real quick.

134
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:07,730
All right.

135
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,870
So, it's gonna launch in seven minutes.

136
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,370
But the very first merchandise drop is...

137
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,600
I will be doing an official collaboration with Gina Draws.

138
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:30,790
If you guys don't recognize Gina Draws, she's actually a Dragoon and runs a very successful own shop.

139
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,990
And with my collaboration with Gina Draws, we will have...

140
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,110
This is just one of a big collection.

141
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,850
But we're releasing this early just for the anniversary.

142
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,350
So, we have a pajama set and an eye mask.

143
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,210
And if you buy the set together, you'll get a freebie sticker.

144
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,210
Yeah!

145
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,730
I love the eye mask.

146
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,490
The eye mask is so good.

147
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,450
So, this is the first anniversary...

148
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:08,090
One of the other merch drops that's gonna be coming out today.

149
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,650
So, this is releasing on Gina's website.

150
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,050
In approximately six minutes at 5.30 PM PST.

151
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,410
So, let me show you the other pictures that I was...

152
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,630
Oops, that's not it.

153
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,530
I almost attached something else early.

154
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,810
So, here is more details.

155
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,190
So, there's pajama set.

156
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,750
It goes from small to 3XL.

157
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,870
And then there's the eye mask.

158
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,170
And then there's an exclusive pre-order freebie.

159
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,170
So, pre-orders are expected to ship on May, June 2025.

160
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,930
So, it's gonna be on the GinaDraws.com website.

161
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,250
That's where you can start pre-ordering.

162
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,330
And you can follow Gina Draws for more updates regarding this.

163
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,270
The pre-orders actually end in two weeks, guys.

164
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,610
There is only two weeks to grab this merch.

165
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,290
So, this is limited edition.

166
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,530
It is specifically for a first anniversary.

167
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,410
So, yeah.

168
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:23,390
If you guys want the eye mask and the pajama set, make sure to grab them before it's gone.

169
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,230
And sadly, this is also one of the several merch teasers that I'll be posting.

170
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,590
So, I'm very sorry.

171
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,810
I'm very sorry for your wallet.

172
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,070
I'm so sorry.

173
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,290
I'm so sorry.

174
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,590
But yes, Luna's so cute!

175
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,570
I was there to personally help with designing and giving my input on all of it.

176
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,710
I love them.

177
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,830
I love the eye mask so much.

178
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,730
It's actually so fucking cute.

179
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,690
I cannot get over the eye mask.

180
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,690
I really can't.

181
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,970
No, I just bought the dead drawing!

182
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,010
But yes, let me pin.

183
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:21,470
Also, sadly, my main manager is not available right now.

184
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,650
So, when I announce my other merch drop, I'm gonna have to do the shop myself.

185
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,290
So, like, this is gonna get a little scuffed.

186
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,330
Like, I'm nearly a one-man army right now.

187
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:40,410
Pre-order your pajama set here.

188
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,510
So, like, it's all over the place at the moment, really.

189
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,330
But yes, I'm sorry.

190
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,350
I'm just...

191
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,250
I think it's also because I'm sick, too.

192
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,570
So, my brain is extra fried.

193
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,910
I just bought the plushie, Doki!

194
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,350
Okay, I might as well announce this one, too.

195
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,450
If you just bought the plushie, I'm so sorry.

196
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,070
Doki, what do you mean by that?

197
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,750
Doki, what do you mean by, I'm so sorry?

198
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,610
Um...

199
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:29,730
But I will... I know I should be like, you know, Doki, you need to, like, you know, tease them out longer.

200
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,630
I...

201
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,410
Guys, um...

202
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,270
Um...

203
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,690
It's not... It's not this month.

204
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,690
I'll let you guys know right now.

205
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,830
It is not this month.

206
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,310
What I'm about to tease right now is not this month.

207
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,410
So, you have time.

208
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,610
You have time.

209
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,730
But I'm very sorry for your future, Dragoons.

210
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,470
I'm very...

211
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,730
Oh, man.

212
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,030
I see everybody suggesting things.

213
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,910
And you're all right.

214
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:07,990
Because...

215
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,190
No!

216
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,910
Okay.

217
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,290
So...

218
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,550
All right.

219
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,650
Okay.

220
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,710
So...

221
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,650
As you can see...

222
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,450
Whoa, what could they be?

223
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,310
I wonder.

224
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,550
Oh, my God.

225
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,970
What the fuck could all of these be?

226
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,290
These won't be this month.

227
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,910
I'll let you guys know right now.

228
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,950
These are not available this month.

229
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,190
But...

230
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,490
They might be soon.

231
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,490
So, this is a little teaser for all of you guys.

232
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,410
For what's gonna be happening in the future.

233
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,590
So...

234
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,410
So, I'm so sorry.

235
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,910
I'm sorry my anniversary is around tax season.

236
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:06,630
Okay?

237
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,490
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,290
I know.

239
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,270
The timing couldn't be more fucked up.

240
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:18,930
Um...

241
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,410
Uh-huh.

242
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,130
GK, thank you for the super chat.

243
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:21,450
Thank you.

244
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,150
Thank you.

245
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:22,830
Oh, sweet.

246
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,050
New Doki bird merch.

247
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,270
Puts it next to Marvel merch.

248
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,210
Leaves room, but returns.

249
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:26,910
Okay, down.

250
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,410
Hey, what happened to all my raccoon...

251
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,250
Rocket raccoon?

252
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,590
Black Panther and me and stuff.

253
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,410
They're destroyed.

254
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,850
Thank you for the super chat.

255
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,190
Thank you.

256
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:34,430
Thank you.

257
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,530
As God intended.

258
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,190
As God...

259
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,210
Blake, thank you for the Akasupa.

260
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:40,710
Thank you.

261
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,630
Thank you.

262
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,450
All right.

263
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:43,650
Anyway.

264
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,830
That's not all.

265
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,570
But I'm not gonna announce the next thing yet.

266
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,950
Because, like...

267
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,650
Um...

268
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,050
Obviously...

269
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,690
Blake...

270
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,710
It's not...

271
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,370
It's...

272
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:53,990
It's gonna...

273
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,010
It's gonna be wild.

274
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,350
Oh, yeah.

275
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,870
I believe...

276
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,050
Let me see if the drop has happened yet.

277
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,150
Because it was supposed to be at...

278
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,130
Oh, there it is!

279
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,570
If you refresh the website!

280
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,470
It's up!

281
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,030
Oh, my God!

282
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,790
There it is.

283
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,610
I see it.

284
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,230
I see it.

285
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,030
If you refresh the website right now...

286
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,490
Um...

287
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,730
The Doki Bird pajama set is now up, guys.

288
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,110
Yay!

289
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,230
Let's go!

290
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,550
All right.

291
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,410
So, yeah!

292
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,250
Let me talk about the...

293
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,530
Okay.

294
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,630
So...

295
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,230
Um...

296
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:32,710
I'm really proud of the 3D team for working incredibly hard on doing everything.

297
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,110
Like, I want to sincerely apologize to the 3D team.

298
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,130
Because sometimes I was just not reachable.

299
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,110
Because I was so busy.

300
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,870
And then they would have to send me, like, several messages to be like, Hey, Doki!

301
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,510
Yeah, we sort of need you to approve stuff.

302
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,270
And I was like, I'm sorry.

303
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,090
I'm a mess right now.

304
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,150
I'm so sorry.

305
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,110
But, like, I'm glad they understand.

306
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,130
Like, in the future...

307
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,750
Okay, so, like, these are how my future projects are now set.

308
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,190
Because, sadly...

309
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,110
Not sadly, but the...

310
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,970
No matter what MV was, like, just solely done by me.

311
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,530
Like, not done by me, but, like...

312
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,230
I was, like, the main point of contact.

313
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,130
But, in the...

314
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,930
Like, my newer projects...

315
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,990
I have delegated to my staff.

316
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,650
And then, so, like, if they can't reach me...

317
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,530
If they can't reach me, my staff...

318
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,890
They'll reach out to my staff member.

319
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,070
And then my staff member will yell at me every day until I...

320
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,570
No, I don't cry.

321
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,770
And then they'll be like, If you don't work on this, I also stop working.

322
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,690
And I'll be like, no, don't stop working!

323
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,530
I'll get on to it, I'm sorry!

324
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm so sorry!

325
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,070
I would get, like...

326
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,730
I'd get, like, lectured by my manager.

327
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,930
Like, what are you...

328
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,810
Work on this!

329
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,950
I'm like, okay, I'm sorry, I will!

330
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,530
I'm sorry!

331
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,190
Please don't stop working!

332
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,110
But it's very motivating.

333
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,530
It's...

334
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,730
Like, my manager has been...

335
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:16,350
Like, my staff and my manager has been, like, my motivation to, like...

336
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,010
To, like, not slack off.

337
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,170
And I really appreciate it.

338
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,610
Gina, thank you for the Akasupa!

339
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,690
Thank you, thank you!

340
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,790
There she is!

341
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,730
Happy Doki Day!

342
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,330
So proud and honored to be a dragon!

343
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,290
Thank you for the Akasupa!

344
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,030
Thank you, thank you!

345
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,110
I really appreciate it.

346
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,350
Thank you so much, Gina.

347
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,410
It was great working with you.

348
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,370
And I cannot wait to showcase the rest of the collection in the future!

349
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,350
Doki, what do you mean, the rest of the collection?

350
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:56,890
Well...

351
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,870
I told you, this year, we're gonna be...

352
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,530
We're gonna be fix...

353
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,170
We are gonna fix our merch issue and actually have merch come out.

354
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,190
So, last year, we might have, you know...

355
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,850
It was a bit of a mess last...

356
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,150
Okay, I'm not gonna lie, it was not a bit...

357
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,370
It was sort of a huge mess last year.

358
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,510
We're still fixing things, but, like, things are...

359
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,130
You know, people are getting, receiving their stuff now.

360
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,590
But, like...

361
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:32,430
But, like, this year, we fixed a lot of what was not working.

362
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,470
And because of that, we're able to actually...

363
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,670
We can actually have, like, merch for you guys.

364
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,610
Official merch and stuff.

365
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,070
Things I've always wanted to do and everything.

366
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,450
So, yeah, I'm super excited.

367
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,610
I'm really happy that we're actually making progress and everything.

368
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:45,970
Oh, yes!

369
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,590
Let me grab a screenshot of...

370
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,550
Let me grab a screenshot of the credits.

371
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,310
Because I want to show you guys, like, all the people that worked on it.

372
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,770
I'm super excited.

373
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,970
I'm super happy with the team.

374
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,410
You might see some familiar faces on the team.

375
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,630
And some people who are new as well.

376
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,850
So, it was funny because, like...

377
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,390
I love, like, discovering...

378
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,530
I don't know if discovering is the right word.

379
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,810
But I love, like, finding new people to work with.

380
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,410
And, like, you guys know how I usually...

381
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,410
Usually, how I find people is just...

382
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,630
Okay, so, like, my Twitter for you page is so good.

383
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,410
It's, like, works really well for me.

384
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,890
Because, like, that's how I find, like, artists and animators and stuff.

385
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,690
And I also, like...

386
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:39,730
A lot of, like, very talented animators and artists that have done, like, fan art and stuff for VTubers as well.

387
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,690
And everything.

388
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,550
So, it really is very helpful.

389
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,890
Like, being able to, like, see stuff like that.

390
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,530
By the way!

391
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,330
If you guys didn't know...

392
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,030
If you guys didn't notice...

393
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:56,470
So, like, here are all the talented people that worked on the video.

394
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,850
So, you can see some familiar names and some new people.

395
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,830
That's been...

396
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,670
Some familiar names of people that I've always worked with a lot for 3D things.

397
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,870
And...

398
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,570
And some newer names that you might not have seen them before.

399
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,530
Someone was like, Jimmy!

400
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,550
We have our animator, Chilifish.

401
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,930
Is...

402
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,410
Actually, English is not their first language.

403
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:27,290
So, we had Jimmy help translate some of the instructions and stuff like that to help Chilifish, who was our main animator.

404
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,110
Huge shoutout to Chilifish.

405
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,070
They are a very talented animator.

406
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,890
They've done a lot of stuff.

407
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,310
I need you guys to know...

408
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,090
Chilifish animated all of these.

409
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,810
I think on a laptop.

410
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,570
I'm pretty sure.

411
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,590
It was a laptop or, like, not the very best PC.

412
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,290
So, it was insane.

413
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,290
The things they were able to do.

414
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,450
I think it was.

415
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,670
I might be spreading misinformation.

416
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,230
Let me double check real quick.

417
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,790
Yes.

418
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,210
Okay.

419
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:56,970
Yes.

420
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,250
Chilifish animated all of the video on a laptop.

421
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,050
Isn't that fucking insane?

422
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,110
This person is so talented.

423
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,930
Like, just imagine what Chilifish could do on an actual PC.

424
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,430
Like...

425
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,970
Like...

426
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,110
I was very impressed.

427
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,550
Like...

428
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,150
Yeah.

429
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,290
So, huge shoutout to the animator.

430
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,910
You might recognize Jules, who's been our project lead for a lot of 3D projects.

431
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,590
Because they're very well-versed in project management.

432
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,930
And have done a lot of management for me for project management for a few things.

433
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,170
And Yuni for the concept art, the backgrounds.

434
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,150
Nem for the motion graphics.

435
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,750
And, like, some of the 3D props, 3D graphics.

436
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,110
We had a storyboard artist.

437
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,850
We had a lot of people going in, helping out and everything.

438
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,410
And, like, Resurq, Squid, SaltedFish, Plixer.

439
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:08,490
A lot of them helping in with a lot of the stuff that took to make this video.

440
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,910
And, like I said, huge shoutout to all of them for working incredibly hard.

441
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,050
Because it's been a work in progress for a while now.

442
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:22,270
So, I'm really excited that we actually were able to release the video to you guys on an anniversary.

443
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,010
Like, you know, on a special day and everything.

444
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,660
So, I'm, like, I'm muting my coughs because that's not hot.

445
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,660
Other announcements.

446
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,620
If you guys didn't know already, if you guys didn't see on Twitter.

447
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,760
I know some of you guys don't want to go on Twitter anymore.

448
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,760
Which is very understandable.

449
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,900
Like, I'm terminally online.

450
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,560
So, like, that's not the case for me.

451
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,880
I get my misinformation and news on Twitter.

452
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,740
Which is basically the same thing.

453
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,540
So, like, I have to be on Twitter.

454
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,260
And also, like, you know, I am a quote-unquote influencer.

455
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,880
So, I do have to be, sadly, I do have to be on Twitter.

456
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,340
Even though I'm not as active as, like, you know.

457
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,920
I lurk.

458
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,640
I am a lurker.

459
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,540
I've always been a lurker.

460
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,160
And it's very hard to not be a lurker.

461
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,800
Anyway, so, if you guys didn't know.

462
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,640
For those who don't go on Twitter anymore.

463
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,400
I have an official plushie now.

464
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,480
Yeah!

465
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,640
So, good smile.

466
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,660
The people who made our Nendoroid.

467
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,960
They reached out to me.

468
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,040
Like, during all the pre-orders were happening.

469
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,700
That they wanted to make an official plushie for me.

470
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,020
And I was so surprised.

471
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,540
Because I was like, oh my god.

472
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,160
Like, you know, I didn't expect them to also offer this as well.

473
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,340
So, I was very excited to work with Good Smile.

474
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,360
To, you know, make me a marketable plushie.

475
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,820
Like, an official plushie from Good Smile in general.

476
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,940
Is actually insane to think about.

477
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,580
And I, you know, I was very honored.

478
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,120
I got to pick between if I wanted Retro Doki.

479
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,080
Or, you know, Bounty Hunter Doki.

480
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,080
And I decided to do Bounty Hunter.

481
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,460
Because I was like, you know what?

482
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,060
You know, we already have Retro Doki as an android.

483
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,340
I want something newer for the Bounty Hunter Doki.

484
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,020
Because, you know, Bounty Hunter Doki doesn't really have a lot of merch as yet.

485
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,960
Like, official merch.

486
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,320
So, I was like, let's go with Bounty Hunter Doki.

487
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,320
And then we can have Doki Amber Doge with me too.

488
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,880
Like, the fact that he's on my head and everything.

489
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,800
So, yeah.

490
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,900
It's actually, you can pre-order it right now.

491
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,420
Either on the Good Smile website.

492
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,740
Or on other websites like AmiAmi and everything.

493
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,980
So, yeah.

494
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,140
This is another announcement I wanted to make.

495
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,700
And...

496
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,780
Fuck, I didn't mean myself.

497
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,240
I'm so sorry.

498
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:05,980
So...

499
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,200
That is another announcement.

500
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,860
I still have several more announcements and everything.

501
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,060
But first off, let's just, you know...

502
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,780
I don't want to, like, fucking throw everything at you guys.

503
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,900
I don't want to be like, and there's more!

504
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,660
And then just keep chucking more and more stuff at you guys.

505
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,600
And be like, please.

506
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,740
I'm gonna, I'm gonna be over stuff.

507
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,720
And then I'm gonna fucking explode.

508
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,840
Like...

509
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,420
I'm sorry.

510
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,440
I might have, like, overfed my dragoons today.

511
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,840
But also, like, sold their money too.

512
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,860
I might have, like, overfed you guys so you can't run.

513
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,160
And then I'd be like, here's your wallet.

514
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,960
Please.

515
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,920
That's right.

516
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,800
I feed you guys so much you can't run away.

517
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,060
Make it fast for my wallet.

518
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,720
Don't let it suffer.

519
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,660
Thank you for the super chat.

520
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,820
Thank you, thank you.

521
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,080
Also, if you guys didn't know...

522
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:15,600
I have released the 3D Chibi model of the Bounty Hunter model now.

523
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,200
So you can download.

524
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,920
Yes, I've been holding on to this Chibi model for so long.

525
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,280
Because I was gonna release it.

526
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,820
I was gonna release it when the video was out.

527
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:31,220
And now that it's finally out, I can finally release the Chibi model.

528
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,700
So you can go to my Sketchfab.

529
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,220
My mod can link that right now for me.

530
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,620
You can go to my Sketchfab and, of course, you can use it however you like.

531
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,480
As long as, like, you know, you don't do anything, like...

532
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,900
Like, I don't wanna say stupid.

533
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,940
You can do stupid things with it.

534
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,520
But, you know, like, nothing illegal.

535
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,100
That's all.

536
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,080
Nothing illegal, please.

537
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,880
And no, like, I don't know.

538
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,660
You know the rules.

539
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,400
You know the fucking rules.

540
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,980
Like, I don't have to repeat them or anything.

541
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,560
But yes, you can now download this model for free on Sketchfab.

542
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,800
For any use you want with it.

543
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,100
Well, I shouldn't say any.

544
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,560
With restrictions.

545
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,000
Any use you want with it, with restrictions.

546
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
You know the rules.

547
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,860
But yes, that's another announcement right there.

548
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,260
Also, I usually do this for all my MVs.

549
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,460
But, like, for the member goons.

550
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,840
So, I'll be posting a tweet.

551
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,900
English is hard right now.

552
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,180
I'll be posting a tweet after the stream.

553
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:50,020
Asking which screenshot, which, like, image, still image, you would like to have on No Matter What as a wallpaper.

554
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,140
And then I'll be putting, zipping all of that.

555
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,900
And then posting it in memberships.

556
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,240
So, this is something that I do for memberships if I release any MVs or anything.

557
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:08,480
So, member goons will have access to the wallpapers of, like, still frames of No Matter What, the MV.

558
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,280
So, I'll be tweeting about it.

559
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,820
Be like, oh, which image do you want to have as a wallpaper?

560
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,840
And then I'll be grabbing all the images and stuff.

561
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,720
And then putting it, um, and then putting it as, like, you know, putting it in members.

562
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,240
So, you have to be a member, you have to be a member to be able to access the wallpapers itself.

563
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:34,520
Uh, and also we have other wallpapers too, that you can, there's a lot of wallpapers and stuff, uh, for people, um, in the memberships.

564
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,020
And it's not, there's not just, like, you know, the MVs, there's, like, other illustration wallpapers.

565
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,220
I usually give free wallpapers every month.

566
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,900
Except for this month, because, like, no, except for, no, we have a Valentine's wallpaper coming out this month.

567
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,200
But we didn't have one for January because I fucked up.

568
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,960
Um, so we're having two wallpapers in March, I think.

569
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,500
It was either March or May, I don't remember.

570
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I have a lot of things going on, I stopped remembering things now.

571
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:08,460
I legitimately, I, I stopped, I, like, you know, you're, like, you have too much information, so you start deleting things that don't matter.

572
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,960
So, like, I don't remember people's last names anymore.

573
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,480
Like, I, I legitimately, like, there's, like, information that I've, like, stopped keeping track of.

574
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,880
It's just, like, not important enough anymore.

575
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,100
Not, like, your name's not important anymore to me.

576
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:34,320
And, so, I just, like, it's like a hard drive, and now I'm just, like, delete them right now.

577
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,840
So, um, anyway, yeah, so, like, that's how my life's going so far.

578
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,460
And then, like, I, I, I don't, okay, sometimes I don't even remember what's gonna happen next month anymore.

579
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:55,580
I mean, like, my staff keeps track of, like, all my oblig- you know, like, when conventions announce that I'm gonna be guesting there?

580
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,680
And I was, like, oh, fuck, wait, am I?

581
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,140
I, I, I, but they do the announcement.

582
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,280
I was, like, oh, my God, I'm doing that?

583
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,880
Whoa, that's a surprise for me, too.

584
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,060
Because I forgot.

585
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,380
Because, like, usually conventions, they reach out really early on.

586
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,740
Um, they reach out super early on and stuff.

587
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,400
So, like, my staff would be, like, do you wanna do this?

588
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,040
And I was, like, sure.

589
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,240
And then a couple- and then I forget, you know?

590
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,900
I just say yes, sign the contract, and then, like, I forget about it.

591
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,560
Because I was, like, there's so many things going on!

592
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:38,340
And then, and then, like, you know, they announce it, and then my staff would be, like, we need you to retweet this.

593
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,240
And I was, like, wait, oh, my God, I'm going to Australia?

594
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,020
Let's go!

595
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,060
And then, I'm pretty sure I'm going to forget about it within, like, because the Australia one is, like, what?

596
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,480
It's, like, at May or something?

597
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,600
Or April?

598
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,260
And then I'm going to- it's going to be, like, May?

599
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,920
And then my staff's going to be, like, remember, you have a convention in two weeks!

600
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,040
I was, like, I have a convention in two weeks?

601
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,840
Yeah, it's an announcement for me as well.

602
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,480
Certified Toki moment.

603
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,260
More falls, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

604
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,040
I'll be, like, I usually, you know, I plan things weekly and stuff.

605
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,340
So, yeah, no, my staff has a calendar for all my official events that I sign contracts for.

606
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,780
And then, yeah, I literally, they just be, like, do you want to do this?

607
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,320
And then I'll be, like, yeah, sure.

608
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,220
But, like, sometimes- okay, so, last year, this was an issue last year.

609
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,860
By the way, thank you guys so much for the insane support.

610
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:49,380
Thank you for companies, for conventions, like, all the insane support and, like, things they want to do with me and stuff like that.

611
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,080
And, like, I had an issue last year where I said yes to a lot of things.

612
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,980
And then my calendar was so fucking stuffed.

613
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,240
And even my staff was, like, I don't care, you sure?

614
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,900
And I'll be, like, yeah, sure, what's the problem?

615
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,960
Yeah, sure, like, it's only a couple months, like, I don't have to worry about it later on.

616
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,620
And then, you know, a couple months later, it happens.

617
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,560
And then I find out I have to do three conventions within one month.

618
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,640
And then I was, like, oh, man, why didn't anybody stop me?

619
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,800
And my staff would be, like, we did.

620
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,260
We told you it might be too many.

621
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,840
And then I'd be, like, oh, man, fuck.

622
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:41,800
And then, so, like, this year, I also really wanted to meet as many Dragoons as possible.

623
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,940
But last year, I learned what my limits are.

624
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,640
And, like, because I was, like, I never get a chance to do any of these before.

625
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,840
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

626
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,580
I never got to meet so many Dragoons in so many different parts of the world.

627
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,180
I want to do it all.

628
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,940
And then, like, last year, I learned my limits.

629
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,420
I was, like, it was great.

630
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,960
I had a great time meeting so many Dragoons and everything.

631
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,700
But I definitely might have overextended myself.

632
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,540
Like...

633
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,960
I for sure overextended.

634
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,140
So this year, this year, I told my staff.

635
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,060
I was, like, okay, like, I'm going to forget about this.

636
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,020
But I need you guys to make remember this for me.

637
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:32,320
And, like, make sure I don't book, like, three plus conventions in one month.

638
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:38,280
And also, maybe, like, you know, stagger these conventions too.

639
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,040
I don't know.

640
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,680
Seems like good advice.

641
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,320
And if I try to be, like, no, I can do this.

642
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,580
Stop me.

643
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,420
I was, like, if I, for some fucking reason, feel like I'm, like, invincible.

644
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,760
And, like, I can do it all.

645
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,200
Stop me.

646
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,620
Because I know I'm not now.

647
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,160
Don't let future Doki ruin this for me.

648
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,720
So...

649
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,300
Yeah, so...

650
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,560
I was, like, make sure I don't do this.

651
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,340
Don't do that.

652
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,940
But that's basically how it's been going so far.

653
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,660
I can stop any...

654
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,180
I cannot.

655
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,000
I cannot stop anytime.

656
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,760
I, like, I wish I could.

657
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,900
I really do wish I had that much power.

658
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,500
But yes, happy one year.

659
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,620
It's crazy.

660
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,560
I feel like it has not felt like one year.

661
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,360
I'm not gonna lie, Dragons.

662
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,980
It really does not feel like one year at all.

663
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,380
This has been the fastest year it's been.

664
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,100
I feel like I just spend run my entire career within that one year.

665
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
It doesn't feel real.

666
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,180
It does not feel real at all.

667
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,640
And, you know, obviously there's a lot of things I would love to do.

668
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:24,180
But I also feel like I've done so many things I didn't think I could ever do, too.

669
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,700
And, like, a lot of, like, these brand deals and people who noticed me and stuff like that.

670
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:40,740
And I can't believe I had a video hit a million views and it wasn't even on my channel.

671
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,680
I hear you, Motoki.

672
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,940
You've had, like, a livestream hit a million views.

673
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,180
Okay, but I haven't had a video hit it.

674
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:58,700
Okay, so for those who don't know, um, Kony made a video about the whole Marvel Rivals, Twitch Rivals thing.

675
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,120
And it went viral.

676
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,760
And I was the one that told her, I was like, just use, you can use me as clickbait.

677
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,960
And, like, you can, like, just, like, be as go-fucking-unfiltered as possible.

678
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,660
Cause Kony was like, should I restrain myself?

679
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,960
Like, should I do-restrain myself?

680
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,400
Do you think this is too much?

681
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,940
I legitimately said, it's not too much, you should go harder.

682
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,520
So, you're welcome, Kony.

683
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,640
Anyway, that video got a million views within a week, by the way.

684
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Um, so, like, I think I went viral again.

685
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,340
How many times do I have to, it's actually crazy.

686
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:50,460
I feel like within that year, I have went viral so many times within, like, the normie sphere.

687
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:58,980
Like, I don't know what is up with my luck and, like, being, like, making, like, I don't even have to try anymore.

688
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,920
I just, I just stumbled onto it every time.

689
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,600
Like, it's just, it's just like, I just stumbled onto, like, I'm like the third wheel of virals.

690
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:19,580
Like, every time I go viral, it's because I'm like a third wheel just observing something that happens.

691
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,100
And it just happens, I just happen to be, like, sort of involved.

692
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:38,320
Like, so, so, like, also, like, but then for some reason, despite going viral, I'm still incredibly unlucky.

693
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,300
I feel like I got sick, I got food poisoning.

694
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:52,080
Um, I, I, like, um, I had, like, a very weird trip in Japan.

695
00:37:53,120 --> 00:38:02,840
Like, I talked to you guys about, oh my god, about some, like, the weird shit that was, like, going on in Japan and stuff.

696
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:10,980
And, uh, yeah, it just, they're like, you can have a good life on the internet, but fuck you in real life.

697
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,320
Oh my god, um, but it's actually, it's actually fucking wild.

698
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,000
I, I, I can't even name, I can't even, like, list, I mean, I did list all the stuff that, like, has happened within the year.

699
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,440
But it's still a lot of stuff that's happened.

700
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:38,080
And then, like, you know, I became one of the top VTubers for Marvel Rivals 2, which is really crazy to think about.

701
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,180
Because I never thought that I'd be, like, even though I sort of stopped, oh, I sort of stopped, like, streaming.

702
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,000
It's, right, Marvel Rivals, because, you know, I have to catch up on a lot of things, too.

703
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:54,440
Like, I can't really, also, like, our, my relationship with Twitch is, like, it's on, it's complicated right now.

704
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:54,900
It's...

705
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,080
I'm at a, it's complicated at the moment, so...

706
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,960
So, that's why I haven't been streaming Marvel Rivals.

707
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,560
And, like, also, it's actually crazy.

708
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,360
When I queue rank in Marvel Rivals, so many people, like, recognize me, too.

709
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,660
Like, high ELO players recognize me.

710
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,280
Not just, like, pro players, but other high ELO players.

711
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:29,220
But then, like, either they shit talk me or they, like, wish me good luck or be like, I'm a fan.

712
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,400
And I'm like, but then, like, the people that shit talk me, I'm like, what did I do to you?

713
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,420
Like, I was like, I'll be like, we're winning!

714
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:39,940
Like...

715
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,940
So...

716
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,100
So, like, it's weird.

717
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,220
It's such a weird scenario to be in.

718
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,380
But, yeah, so there's a lot of those things going on and everything.

719
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:03,340
And, oh my god, it's just, like, obviously, I couldn't do it without you guys.

720
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:09,380
You guys, like, helped me get to, like, this point of my life.

721
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,920
I'm still a mess.

722
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,080
I'm still, I'm still, I'm not gonna lie, I'm still a mess right now.

723
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,860
There's, like, so many things to fix still.

724
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,680
Like, running my own, like, you know, business is incredibly hard.

725
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,100
I'm scared of taxes right now.

726
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,440
I'm...

727
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,340
I'm really scared.

728
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,480
You know, taxes before were a lot easier to do.

729
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,820
But, like, taxes now, I'm fucking ner... I'm scared.

730
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,340
By the way...

731
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,540
By the way, guys...

732
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,660
Oh, shit, ow, sorry.

733
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:56,340
Oh, yeah, so, like, another fucked up thing that happened to me in Japan, by the way, is that I got an infection on my finger.

734
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,600
And I've never got an infection on my finger before.

735
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,860
So, like, I, so, like, like, it was, like, on the side of my finger.

736
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:13,820
And then there was, like, and then it was, like, swollen and it hurt for, like, for, like, three, three plus days.

737
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,460
And you know when the infection stopped?

738
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,080
When I got home.

739
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:20,860
So...

740
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,960
So, like, fuck me, I guess.

741
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,060
No, it's gone now, it's better.

742
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,380
It was, like, it was just, like, um, it was just, like, a small infection and stuff.

743
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,860
It was just literally, like, a small infection on the side of my finger.

744
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,960
Like, cause, like, the crease between the nail and the finger.

745
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,140
I don't know how, I've never had that happen before.

746
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,100
I don't know.

747
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,100
I think Japan, I don't know, maybe I'm cursed in Japan.

748
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,970
After everything I've been through, like, um, my body is rejecting it now.

749
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,300
Like, my body is just, it was just, like, trauma for my body.

750
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,920
It was so weird.

751
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,940
I was just, like, how the fu- I've never had that happen before.

752
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,000
It is actually...

753
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,520
It is actually crazy.

754
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,260
Like, I've never got food.

755
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,400
The last time I got food poisoning was when I was a child.

756
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,760
And then, like, and then I got an infection on my finger.

757
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,340
And then I got a cold on the last day.

758
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,700
Like, my body was, like, just, I don't know, like, I guess you're gonna die.

759
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,840
It's just, like, happy one year anniversary.

760
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,480
Okay, sorry, that got a little dark.

761
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,560
Sorry, that was dark humor.

762
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,560
I'm sorry, guys.

763
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,060
I'm so sorry.

764
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,560
Yeah, it was actually, my body was just giving up in general.

765
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,680
I still love Japan.

766
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,000
I think, like...

767
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,260
I think if I ever go back to Sapporo, it'd be in the summer.

768
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:12,800
I'm sorry.

769
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,120
I know, you're like, Toki, Sapporo's known for their snow.

770
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:23,620
But, like, I'm reminded because, like, I'm reminded of why I hate snow.

771
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,940
Like, it's because, like, I grew up...

772
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,960
I grew up with snow and I always hated snow.

773
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,320
And then, so, like, I was just like, oh, man, how bad could Sapporo be?

774
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,720
I'm used to snow.

775
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,700
But then I remembered, like, Sapporo snow is a lot harsher than where I live.

776
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,420
So I was like, oh, man, I hated snow before.

777
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:53,440
But, like, now I'm reminded of why I hate so much snow.

778
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,900
Yeah, it's very pretty.

779
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,920
I would admit it is incredibly gorgeous.

780
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,900
But I would rather, like, see how pretty it is inside.

781
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,200
I would look at the window and be like, wow, that's beautiful.

782
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,200
And I'd go out and I'd be like, I guess, like, I hate myself.

783
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,760
So, like, but it is beautiful and I love the food there.

784
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,320
I still don't know what got me fucked up, what I ate there that got me incredibly fucked up.

785
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,220
But I still, I still enjoyed my time there.

786
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,040
Despite, like, everything wrong that happened to my body.

787
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,360
And, like, in general, everything wrong that happened to me in general.

788
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:04,700
Also, I forgot to mention, but no matter what the cover song, the cover song with Mint, it is not monetized.

789
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,560
Like, because obviously it's an English song.

790
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,360
Like, I'm pretty sure, like, to get an English song monetized, you gotta go through a lot of...

791
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,860
I gotta pay a lot of money to Cartoon Network.

792
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:27,160
So, like, you know, the rights and stuff to, like, get that video monetized.

793
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,080
And also, like, I don't think a record label would wanna talk to me anyway.

794
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,860
So, like, it's not monetized at all.

795
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,120
But, like, still support the video.

796
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,220
Or, like, if you wanna support the video, I guess watch...

797
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,600
If you wanna watch, like, give me ad revenue on No Matter What.

798
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,520
Just have a stream play in the background, I guess.

799
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,220
Or donate, yeah.

800
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,840
Or super chat, yeah.

801
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,980
Ad revenue.

802
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:59,380
I think it's easier to just have one stream play in the background to make up for the no ad revenue on No Matter What.

803
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,200
Cartoon Network is bankrupt, I thought.

804
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,520
Yeah, that's why they're taking my monetization on that money.

805
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,700
That's why they took it off.

806
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,000
They took the monetization off of that video.

807
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,280
Why else do you think they need it?

808
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,020
Mr. Orange, thank you for the super chat.

809
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,700
Thank you, thank you.

810
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,140
You should go to a SEA country next time.

811
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,240
If you hate snow, it'll make you hate high heat and humidity a lot more.

812
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,480
No, I hate that too.

813
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:48,060
I hate, like, going to, like, anywhere that has, like, a lot of humidity and incredibly hot during the summer.

814
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,280
Which is why I also avoid that as well.

815
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:58,040
So that you go to those places during the winter, and then you go to, like, places that are super cold during the summer.

816
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,520
And then that's the perfect vacation for me.

817
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,120
That's why I stay indoors more.

818
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:14,240
I remember when, like I said, when I first, like, when I first, like, came over to, flew over to China for the first time.

819
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,520
You know, I was born in Canada.

820
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,900
And I flew over, I couldn't breathe.

821
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,160
Because we also went over during the summer.

822
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,740
And I couldn't fucking breathe because of the humidity.

823
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,940
Like, I was not, because in Canada, it's, like, super dry.

824
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:36,520
But, like, you know, from a dry place to, like, incredibly humid place was so fucked up for me.

825
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,580
It was, I was not ready.

826
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,820
And apparently, my blood is very tasty for mosquitoes too.

827
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:51,260
So, like, you know, you know, it was a big wake-up call for me in general, for, like, Little Doki in general.

828
00:47:51,400 --> 00:48:00,220
Because I was, like, mosquitoes are, like, she doesn't, oh my god, a child that doesn't have any mosquito repellent.

829
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,980
And is wearing short, like, you know, short sleeves and shorts because she doesn't know better.

830
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:14,820
And, yeah, like, I was practically feeding the homeless mosquitoes, you know.

831
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,680
Zero defenses going in.

832
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:28,920
So, like, you know, it was not the best of times for Little Doki there.

833
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:37,720
It's literally, like, I won't be surprised if mosquitoes start camping out of airports.

834
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,660
Because they know, they knew this is where all the ignorant, ignorant visitors come from.

835
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,570
But, yeah, that's basically how it went.

836
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,750
Thank you, thank you.

837
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,890
Yeah, he's back.

838
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,030
Doki Amber Doge is back right now.

839
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,290
He's just relaxing on his bed.

840
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:14,510
The moment he came, okay, like, I'm pretty sure, like, he's counting the days till he goes back to the babysitter.

841
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:18,430
Because, like, she spoils him so fucking much.

842
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,750
Like, I got given daily, like, dad photos.

843
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,390
And then, like, every time I see that, I'm just, like, calm.

844
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,050
And I don't know if he wants to come home.

845
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,930
I don't know.

846
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:41,430
Like, every time I see those photos, he's just, you know, he looks at her with so much love in his eyes.

847
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:45,090
I'm like, when have you ever looked at me like that?

848
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:49,230
It's been so long since you looked at me like that.

849
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,890
And then, dad would be like, it's not my fault you're focusing on your career.

850
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:58,930
When have you shown me that love before?

851
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:04,170
It's not my fault you just focus on your career.

852
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:09,110
He's like, I need some affection too.

853
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,570
So, like, I think he's cheating on me.

854
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,630
Trouble in paradise.

855
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:25,810
Doki, what?

856
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,090
The new hit drama coming in.

857
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,250
Cas, thank you for the Akasupa.

858
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,190
Thank you, thank you.

859
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,450
This super chat is monetized.

860
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,150
Happy anniversary, Doki.

861
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,770
Thanks for... Yeah, I think he's sulking.

862
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:42,870
I don't think he's sleeping.

863
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,710
Now that you say it, he might be.

864
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:48,670
Oh yeah, I'm paying for his affair too, by the way.

865
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,610
Like, shit, I didn't even think about that.

866
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,730
I'm literally paying for him to have an affair.

867
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,070
The rest of my money will go to Doki, much fun, and Isu.

868
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,950
Thank you for the Akasupa, Cas.

869
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,690
Thank you, thank you.

870
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:09,390
But yes, this little fucker right here.

871
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,610
Okay, I'm cutting him off.

872
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:12,170
That's right.

873
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,870
This little fucker right here.

874
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,090
That's right.

875
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:21,350
He's having an affair and all I can do is work so I can pay for it even more.

876
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:22,170
Alright.

877
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,630
Teach dad a lesson by turning him into a plush.

878
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,130
My girl, thank you for the super chat.

879
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,390
Thank you, thank you.

880
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:37,890
Like, okay, so...

881
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:45,830
And like, the thing is, the babysitter carries him around all the time.

882
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,390
And I'm like, what?

883
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,770
But like, I don't do that.

884
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:58,070
Because like, when I picked up dad, the babysitter came up, like you know, was holding him.

885
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:02,950
And then walked up to me and was like, do you want to carry him or leave him on the floor?

886
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,290
And I was like, no, put him on the ground.

887
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:10,630
Yeah, because like, basically she would like carry him everywhere and stuff.

888
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:14,430
Like, so he doesn't have to walk, you know, like a fucking peasant, I guess.

889
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:18,090
Like, it wasn't even that far from me.

890
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,130
Like, that's the thing.

891
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,050
I was like, why are you carrying him?

892
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,270
But like, yeah, he's spoiled, spoiled, apparently.

893
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:32,630
So like, she like, got off her car and carried him to me.

894
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,830
And then was like, do you want me to put, do you want to carry him?

895
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:36,670
Or like, put him on the floor.

896
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,130
I was like, put him on the fucking floor.

897
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:49,650
And then the moment he got on the floor, he was just like, I hate you.

898
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:55,830
He's like, he's like, now it's over.

899
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,510
It's over.

900
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,330
Why won't you carry me like her?

901
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,210
I don't want him to become an overweight wiener dog.

902
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,410
That's also one of the things.

903
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:17,890
Guys, the worst thing you can have is a fat wiener dog, guys.

904
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:21,930
It's actually terrible because it's not healthy for them.

905
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,830
I don't want him to become a fat wiener dog.

906
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:34,490
Like, it's bad for them because they're too long.

907
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,070
It's bad for their back, guys.

908
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:45,030
I'm trying not to make him fat.

909
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,930
So he can live a longer life.

910
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,770
He'll understand when he's older.

911
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,310
I'm a great parent.

912
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:58,030
You know, like how moms are like, you'll understand when you're older.

913
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,330
And that's what I'm doing to my dog right now.

914
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,150
Anyway, I bought him a little hat in Japan.

915
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,530
And then I like, told my friends.

916
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,370
And my friends were like, oh, he's gonna hate that.

917
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,790
And I'm like, I know.

918
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,890
But it's gonna look so cute.

919
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:25,450
It's like those little winter hats, but for dogs.

920
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,270
But yes, I bought him a little.

921
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:29,310
I bought him a little.

922
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,570
I'll show you guys later.

923
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,930
I have so much photos I want to show you guys.

924
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,830
But I won't do that on another stream because I won't focus on, you know, anniversary.

925
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,110
But there's so many.

926
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,390
I'll do that on the next stream.

927
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,750
Because I have, also like, I haven't prepped any of my photos yet.

928
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,710
So, literally like, yesterday was spent.

929
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:53,150
Yesterday was spent recovering and also prepping something.

930
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,570
Prepping like, announcements and stuff for today.

931
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,050
And then the day before yesterday, I had that Marvel Rivals tournament.

932
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,470
Which I went 1-9.

933
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:04,730
But like, it was stacked against me anyway.

934
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,610
And then after that, I played rank.

935
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,330
Because I was like, I want to win in something, you know.

936
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:13,550
I don't... I'm already depressed.

937
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:17,950
At least let me get top 500.

938
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:24,190
I did beat Shroud, xQc, and Tariq though.

939
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,110
The only team I did beat was xQc, Shroud, and Tariq.

940
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,530
So like, I feel like that's already...

941
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:34,070
That's, you know, I'm happy about that.

942
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:38,510
The only game that actually mattered in the end.

943
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,330
No, it was like, duos.

944
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:47,690
Yeah, it's basically like 9 wins, if you think about it.

945
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,910
That is enough for me.

946
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,510
And then, you know, the day before that...

947
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:58,130
I was also recovering from coming back from Japan.

948
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:01,970
And then I had to like, remember how to play Marvel Rivals.

949
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,370
Because I literally didn't play the game in 2 weeks.

950
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,150
So then, it was literally... I just had no rest.

951
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:09,090
By the way, speaking of no rest.

952
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,970
I will most likely cancel tomorrow's stream.

953
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:12,430
Because...

954
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,450
By the way, guys.

955
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:16,990
Most likely, I will be canceling tomorrow's stream.

956
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,570
Because like, I had a talk with my manager.

957
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:23,490
Like, today and yesterday.

958
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:28,010
And my manager was like, you have so much shit you have to do.

959
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:32,770
Like, as in like, you know, not angry.

960
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:33,910
Okay, a little angry.

961
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,350
I'm like, a little angry.

962
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:41,850
But like, you know, tough love.

963
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:51,490
You know like, you have a lot of stuff you need to do.

964
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,670
And then I was like, I know, I'm sorry.

965
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:56,910
I know.

966
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,190
I'm sorry.

967
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,370
I know, I'm sorry.

968
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,930
I was playing Marvel Rivals.

969
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:05,950
I'm sorry.

970
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:11,510
And they're like, they're just like, you know, I let it go pass by.

971
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,250
Because you're having a moment there.

972
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,350
You are not okay.

973
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,010
But like, you need a...

974
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:19,270
You cannot run away with Marvel Rivals anymore.

975
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,630
And I was like, I'm sorry.

976
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:24,050
Do you want me to help get you to...

977
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,390
Because like, they also play Marvel Rivals.

978
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:33,150
And they're like, you also...

979
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,830
But I was like, I'm so sorry.

980
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:41,270
Anyway, I can help you get to Celestia tonight if you want.

981
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,190
I can get a friend to help out too.

982
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:50,830
I legitimately was like, I'm so sorry.

983
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:54,210
But tomorrow, I'll work on it tomorrow.

984
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,920
But also, this is really private.

985
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:00,210
And then my manager was like, oh, maybe.

986
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,230
I mean, if you have time.

987
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,710
If you have time, yeah, maybe.

988
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:11,250
If your friends can help me out to get to Celestia.

989
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:13,610
I'll be like, oh, yes, it worked.

990
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,690
Yes, it worked.

991
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,790
It fucking worked.

992
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:34,430
I don't give her an excuse, manager.

993
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,010
Yay!

994
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:43,350
Anyway, so I actually have another announcement that I want to give you guys.

995
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,370
Because the video just finished editing.

996
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,710
I hope it...

997
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,030
Honestly, I'm watching this for the first time too.

998
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:55,490
I've been watching this video for the first time as well.

999
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:58,690
So I hope everything goes well for this video.

1000
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,290
Alright, guys.

1001
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,270
So I have another announcement.

1002
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:03,890
My stalling worked.

1003
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,170
I don't know if you guys noticed, but I'm a professional.

1004
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:07,830
And that was actually me trying to stall.

1005
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:12,790
But I do have another announcement for all of you guys.

1006
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,310
And I'm going to be watching this live with you guys too.

1007
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:19,550
So I have no idea how it's going to really go.

1008
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:23,550
The moment I'm putting this video up right now too.

1009
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:24,350
Okay, so.

1010
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,290
Three.

1011
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:27,810
Are you guys ready for the announcement?

1012
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:29,810
Are you guys ready?

1013
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,970
This is not the last announcement, by the way.

1014
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:35,110
This might be the second last announcement.

1015
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:38,530
Three.

1016
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:41,130
Two.

1017
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:43,010
One.

1018
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,350
After a

1019
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,670
long wait since that concert.

1020
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,970
I can finally announce something.

1021
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:54,930
That everyone has been waiting for.

1022
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,450
The most polygons you've ever seen.

1023
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:02,570
A debut that's been anticipated for years.

1024
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,670
My official 3D debut.

1025
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,290
With special guests.

1026
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,190
Special performances.

1027
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,650
Special everything.

1028
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:18,030
And the debut is...

1029
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,710
Right now!

1030
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,330
It's finally here.

1031
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:24,790
Look, dragons.

1032
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,530
I'm 3D now.

1033
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,470
Look at these movements.

1034
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,530
That new 5090 RTX.

1035
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,110
On is hitting hard.

1036
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:39,130
Wait.

1037
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,290
Is this not the Doki you wanted?

1038
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:45,310
I mean, you can't get any more 3D than this.

1039
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,190
I told you.

1040
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:48,810
Anime girls are real.

1041
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,550
Come on, look at these close-ups.

1042
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:52,730
Wow.

1043
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,630
Look at this.

1044
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:56,830
And this.

1045
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,730
It looks like real leather.

1046
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,570
Wait, I know.

1047
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,130
You're expecting something else, right?

1048
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,810
Okay, fine, fine.

1049
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:13,970
I guess you dragons deserve a real 3D debut.

1050
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,270
It is my one-year anniversary.

1051
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,270
Now...

1052
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,910
What you're actually waiting for.

1053
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,970
My real 3D debut.

1054
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:30,990
That's right.

1055
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,250
It's me.

1056
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:34,070
Retro Doki.

1057
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,330
Man, 3D graphics go hard now.

1058
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:39,690
What?

1059
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,450
This is not the 3D debut you're looking for?

1060
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,770
But it looks and feels so real.

1061
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,210
I mean, if you zoom in...

1062
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,910
You might even see some of my pores.

1063
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:52,450
Oh, I see.

1064
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,670
You wanted me in something else, right?

1065
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:57,770
Like her?

1066
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,410
Hey, dragons.

1067
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,890
Is this the 3D Doki you wanted?

1068
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:06,410
I mean...

1069
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:10,050
I am the best Doki that everyone wants to see.

1070
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,870
All Doki is best girl.

1071
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,370
Just like Cathy.

1072
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,010
Okay, okay.

1073
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:16,970
Enough of her.

1074
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:19,430
We don't want you to forget about me.

1075
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:21,330
Look.

1076
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,350
I'm fucking with you guys.

1077
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:24,110
Okay?

1078
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:25,890
I know what you're here for.

1079
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:30,650
Here is the real 3D debut.

1080
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,910
It doesn't get more 3D than this.

1081
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,150
That's right.

1082
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,210
My true form.

1083
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,270
Tomato Doki Bird.

1084
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:43,290
What do you think?

1085
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:44,590
Yeah.

1086
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,830
I grew a little bit bigger than a regular tomato.

1087
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:52,950
I think a year ago, I was this size.

1088
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,510
Alright, alright, dragons.

1089
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:58,250
No more baiting.

1090
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,490
I'm not gonna bait anymore.

1091
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,630
Are you guys ready?

1092
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,370
In 3, 2, 1.

1093
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,890
My real 3D debut.

1094
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,910
Here I am.

1095
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,850
The real Doki.

1096
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:27,290
I mean, what gets realer than this?

1097
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:32,630
Well, I hope you guys enjoyed my 3D debut.

1098
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:33,030
Thank you.

1099
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,470
Happy one year anniversary, dragons.

1100
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:50,520
Thank you everybody for coming to my first year anniversary since I came back.

1101
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:52,420
Surprise.

1102
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,600
I guess that's all I had planned.

1103
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,360
I'm joking, I'm joking.

1104
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,000
There's more announcements later.

1105
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,480
Cock cock.

1106
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,560
Kuroky out.

1107
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,200
Bye.

1108
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,340
Sorry.

1109
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,820
There's no actual 3D debut.

1110
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:08,340
That was just the longest bait and switch I've ever done.

1111
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,320
Bye bye.

1112
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,860
Also, here's me with a cowboy hat.

1113
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:12,800
Yeehaw.

1114
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:13,880
Cock cock.

1115
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,920
Alright, bye.

1116
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,060
I fly away now.

1117
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:30,220
That's basically it.

1118
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,460
There's no 3D debut.

1119
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:43,420
It's not scheduled yet.

1120
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,560
I have zero plans for it yet.

1121
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:56,740
Okay, huge shoutout to everybody that worked on that.

1122
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,740
Because that was done in 24 hours.

1123
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,180
I got the idea.

1124
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:10,240
I got the idea this last, like, yesterday morning.

1125
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,380
Huge shoutout to all the cosplayers.

1126
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,540
To all the cosplayers.

1127
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,220
To the video editor.

1128
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,560
And the crows.

1129
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,500
Sorry, to me.

1130
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,680
Huge shoutout to me for all of that.

1131
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,980
I was like, can you guys actually do this?

1132
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,060
And they're like, yeah, no, we can film it.

1133
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,600
I literally wrote the script.

1134
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:42,620
And then a huge shoutout to the editor, too, for putting this all together.

1135
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,880
I was just like, oh man.

1136
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,320
My real 3D debut.

1137
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,160
Thank you, me, me, and me.

1138
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,240
Thank you to all the dookie birds that helped out.

1139
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,800
I would say thank you to...

1140
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,140
Alright, let me grab the people.

1141
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,160
Oh my gosh, I'm on streamer mode, so I can't even grab their...

1142
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,980
Alright, let me write their Twitter handles real quick, guys.

1143
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,100
Huge shoutout especially to the editor.

1144
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,640
Alright, so this is the editor.

1145
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,200
Huge shoutout to them.

1146
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,160
They fucking crushed it editing this.

1147
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,500
I watched that live.

1148
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,320
I gave her all the clips.

1149
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,200
All the clips, all the videos.

1150
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,000
I was like, go wild.

1151
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,480
Do whatever you can before it just...

1152
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,060
I don't know what's gonna happen, but do whatever you can to put all of this together.

1153
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,660
Here's my fucking wild idea.

1154
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,460
If you can do this, I'd be so impressed.

1155
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,560
I could've added DookField, too.

1156
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,080
But then, like, that's already too much work.

1157
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,560
That was too much work.

1158
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,200
So, yes.

1159
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:55,120
That was gonna be my only plan.

1160
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,160
Not gonna lie.

1161
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,200
That was actually gonna be, like...

1162
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,720
Might've been, like, the only thing I was gonna show today.

1163
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:05,640
But then the fact that we managed to get the music video done as well.

1164
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,340
So I was like, oh, we have multiple things I can fuck around with.

1165
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,200
You know, I have...

1166
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,980
There's, like, multiple things I could do.

1167
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:16,680
Thank God.

1168
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:21,140
Let me do the font real quick for everybody.

1169
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,060
Alright.

1170
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:22,280
Alright.

1171
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,220
And then...

1172
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,760
Okay, here we go.

1173
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,160
Alright, so, this is the editor.

1174
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,200
Huge shoutout to the editor.

1175
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,540
And then I'll show you guys all the cosplayers and everything, too.

1176
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,500
Alright, so huge shoutout to the editor for...

1177
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,520
Imagine the last announcement is actually the 3D.

1178
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:47,240
And you guys should know, I have not contacted any studios yet regarding my 3D.

1179
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,120
So...

1180
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,880
It's gonna be a wave.

1181
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,120
I just thought it'd be fun.

1182
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:57,040
Because I know some people are like, oh my gosh, she's gonna announce her 3D debut date.

1183
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,320
And I was like, oh, but what if I did?

1184
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,020
What if...

1185
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,560
I was like, oh, man.

1186
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,220
But what if I did announce it?

1187
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,000
Oh, man.

1188
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,960
Alright, so here is all the other cosplayers.

1189
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,320
Like I said, please check them out.

1190
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,420
The fact that they were able to get all of this...

1191
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:30,200
Like, film all of that for me within a day was crazy.

1192
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,940
I was not expecting them to be able to...

1193
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,120
I just was not expecting that to work.

1194
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:41,380
I was gonna be like, whatever cosplayer I could get...

1195
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:47,480
The fact that all the cosplayers I contacted were free to do this...

1196
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,980
I really appreciate that.

1197
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,860
Like, I was not expecting it, so...

1198
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,400
Thank God it worked out.

1199
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,640
Thank fucking God it worked out in the end.

1200
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,680
Alright, so here's the other one.

1201
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,520
And then...

1202
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,980
Let me grab the tomato and...

1203
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,880
Let's see, this one was...

1204
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,960
The other cosplayer.

1205
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,480
And her child.

1206
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,980
Her child was...

1207
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:20,380
These are all their Twitter handles.

1208
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,960
And her child.

1209
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,060
So, these are everybody that was...

1210
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,680
And...

1211
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,900
Wait, what is it?

1212
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,620
Crows.

1213
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,580
Biggest credit to the child.

1214
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:46,980
Yeah, so...

1215
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,580
Shoutout to...

1216
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,900
Shoutout to all the cosplayers and the editor...

1217
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,100
For doing all that for me.

1218
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,780
I really, really appreciate it.

1219
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,600
I was like...

1220
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:02,440
Like, you know, the biggest bait and switch I've ever done.

1221
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,380
I don't know if I will upload the video itself, but...

1222
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,700
Maybe I should, it's pretty funny.

1223
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:14,220
Maybe I should upload the video, it's pretty fucking silly.

1224
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,880
I liked how I was looking at the view count...

1225
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,880
And it kept going up because people actually thought it was real.

1226
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,400
I'm sorry!

1227
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:27,920
I'm so sorry!

1228
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,720
Like, it jumped like 1.5k.

1229
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,300
And I was like, oh man, people really thought it was real.

1230
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,260
Oh no.

1231
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,240
I was like, oh man.

1232
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,860
People were like, oh man, surely this will be the actual announcement.

1233
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,960
And I was like, psych.

1234
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:52,340
And then I was like, peace out, I'm flying away now.

1235
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,800
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna fly away now, peace.

1236
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,420
Yeah, got me on the first part.

1237
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,900
Yeah, so they were all cosplayers.

1238
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:13,560
Really big thank you to all the cosplayers for doing this.

1239
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,640
Since like, legitimately this morning.

1240
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,520
Last night, not last night.

1241
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,580
Yesterday morning was when I had this idea.

1242
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,840
And then I was like, I don't know.

1243
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,040
I don't know if like, I could do it.

1244
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,600
So I asked all these people.

1245
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,520
And then they're all like, yeah, we can do this.

1246
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:31,500
We can make this happen.

1247
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,040
And I was like, oh my god.

1248
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,160
And then like, huge, biggest shout out to the editor too.

1249
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,720
For putting all this together.

1250
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,660
The fact that I didn't...

1251
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:45,160
That she managed to make all of that into a coherent fucking video.

1252
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,680
Fucking insane.

1253
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,900
It looked amazing.

1254
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,680
I was watching that for the first time too.

1255
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,380
Oh, and the animator.

1256
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,040
Oh my god, sorry.

1257
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,560
Croaky animators.

1258
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,960
Sorry, Croaky looked so real.

1259
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:03,820
That like, I almost forgot that hat isn't real.

1260
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,380
Sorry, sorry.

1261
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,940
The animator that drew a hat on those crows.

1262
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,180
I'm so sorry.

1263
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:16,780
I forgot to talk about the animator that gave them hats.

1264
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:24,980
I felt so immersed that I legitimately like, forgot that it wasn't real.

1265
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,200
Wait, the hat wasn't real?

1266
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,560
What else wasn't real?

1267
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:33,720
But anyway, also huge shout out to the animator.

1268
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:37,640
For animating the hats.

1269
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,960
Alright, here we go.

1270
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,780
YinMelonSoup was in charge of the crows.

1271
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,860
But my immersion...

1272
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,560
What do you mean it wasn't real?

1273
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,860
I thought Croaky was the most realest one of them all.

1274
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,360
I'm so sorry.

1275
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,900
I know, it was just too good to be true.

1276
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,320
It's real to me.

1277
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,020
It's real.

1278
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,840
But yes, huge shout out to YinMelonSoup.

1279
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,820
For drawing, giving the crows hats.

1280
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,680
For the immersion.

1281
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:20,260
Alright, final announcement.

1282
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,640
Final announcement of the night.

1283
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,540
So, I'm sorry to your wallets again.

1284
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:34,640
But, I am announcing a special, special, special thing.

1285
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,640
On my own store.

1286
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,040
Which I have to open myself.

1287
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,160
So, it's gonna be wild.

1288
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:45,480
But, the Doki Day Anniversary Limited Edition Voice Pack.

1289
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,620
So, it's very limited.

1290
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,860
There's only a select number.

1291
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:53,000
Basically, there will be a select number of stock.

1292
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,060
That's gonna be on the store.

1293
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,740
Regarding custom voice pack.

1294
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,700
And a digitally autographed and numbered wallpaper.

1295
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,760
By my mama.

1296
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:04,680
Kamame.

1297
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:10,260
So, I will be opening this on the merch store myself.

1298
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,300
Like, in a couple of...

1299
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,980
But, there will be regular sale of the wallpaper.

1300
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,520
It just won't be...

1301
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,720
There just won't be a custom voice pack.

1302
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,640
Or like, it won't be signed or anything.

1303
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,100
So, there will be a general sale for the wallpaper.

1304
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,500
Plus all the ringtone, alarm, and anniversary voice pack.

1305
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,240
That will be like $5.

1306
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,280
But then, the other one is $100.

1307
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:32,980
I'm sorry.

1308
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,640
I'm sorry.

1309
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,520
The general voice pack is normal price.

1310
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,380
The general voice pack will be there forever.

1311
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,900
The limited one, it was not sold out.

1312
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,640
It will go until February 28th.

1313
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,780
And basically, like I said.

1314
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:59,300
For the custom voice pack, plus the digital autograph.

1315
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,280
And the digital autograph and numbers.

1316
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,180
You can do anything with the wallpaper, by the way.

1317
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,280
If you want to print the things out and stuff.

1318
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:08,820
And...

1319
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:11,500
Basically...

1320
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,000
Oh my gosh, what was I going to say?

1321
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:19,320
The staff will be emailing the members.

1322
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,340
The staff will be...

1323
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,280
Honestly, I could just make it...

1324
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,100
I feel like $100 is a little too much.

1325
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,900
I mean, I'm the boss.

1326
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:26,820
I'll make it $50.

1327
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,120
Because there's so much stuff that you can buy.

1328
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:32,100
The best part about being my own boss is that...

1329
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:37,020
I put $100 because I based it off previous knowledge about this.

1330
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,360
And I feel like there's a lot of...

1331
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,380
There's a lot...

1332
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,240
Just like that.

1333
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,640
Because I was the one that came up with this merch.

1334
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:44,360
And it's all digital.

1335
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:44,900
So...

1336
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,200
Doki...

1337
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:54,200
The thing is, I have a lot of merch stuff going on.

1338
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,340
I feel bad.

1339
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,360
I feel...

1340
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,460
I feel so bad.

1341
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,400
Because there's so much other merch stuff.

1342
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:02,860
How about this?

1343
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,780
We'll go in the...

1344
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:06,300
How about $75?

1345
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,260
$100 with 50% off.

1346
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,340
What a deal.

1347
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,480
Yeah, because I feel like I have so much stuff coming out as well.

1348
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,620
I'll do $75.

1349
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,980
I'm fine with $75.

1350
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,240
We'll go in the middle.

1351
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,380
We'll do $75.

1352
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,820
Make it $200.

1353
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,400
Okay, so...

1354
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,280
There will be a general sell.

1355
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,120
And then you don't have to know what message you want.

1356
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,580
I think it's within 100 words.

1357
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,920
Basically, it's within 100 words.

1358
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,020
Oh, you're right.

1359
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:43,820
I can make it $69.

1360
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,700
You know what?

1361
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,360
I'm going to make it $69.

1362
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:53,060
Wait, no, man.

1363
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:53,900
That's actually...

1364
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,420
That's good.

1365
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,220
Let's make it $69.

1366
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:55,960
That's better.

1367
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,400
$69.69.

1368
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:58,460
Yeah.

1369
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,280
Fucking taxes are going to be weird, but...

1370
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:02,580
Let's do it.

1371
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,820
It's going to be $69.69.

1372
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:06,580
$69.69.

1373
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:08,520
And...

1374
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:11,460
And...

1375
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:14,040
The script has to be within 100 words.

1376
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,020
And you don't have to know what the script is instantly.

1377
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,380
You can just purchase it now.

1378
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,260
And then get...

1379
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,600
My staff will email you guys.

1380
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,260
My staff will email you guys on like...

1381
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:25,300
You know, what you want.

1382
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,240
And stuff like that.

1383
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,260
And then, you know, you've done it before.

1384
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,580
And you sort of know how it goes.

1385
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,920
So that's basically it.

1386
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,500
Alright, let me do the store now.

1387
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,020
Guys, I have to like redo the...

1388
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:38,000
Oh my gosh, my manager is going to fucking yell at me.

1389
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,560
He's going to be like, what do you mean you changed the price last minute?

1390
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,080
Well, you should have been awake.

1391
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,640
It's not my fault.

1392
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:47,160
You should have been awake.

1393
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,960
I would have randomly just changed the price if you weren't awake.

1394
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,240
Okay, $69.69.

1395
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,540
There we go.

1396
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,740
That's right.

1397
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,360
I have to open the store up myself.

1398
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:15,240
You can't blame them for sleeping.

1399
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:16,660
Okay, alright.

1400
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,560
Alright, in three...

1401
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,240
Oh wait, you guys don't even see it right away.

1402
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,200
Because I have to do the banners.

1403
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,480
I have to put the banners on to myself.

1404
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,400
But like, it's active now.

1405
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:26,800
Like...

1406
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,840
Let me put up the other one.

1407
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:30,760
The other one is $5.

1408
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,860
This is the most professional...

1409
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,340
Merch is up now.

1410
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,780
Fucking stream ever.

1411
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,620
Guys, I'm not...

1412
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:40,520
I don't know if I'm good at this.

1413
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:45,720
I don't know if I'm good at doing this.

1414
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,480
By the way, it's up now.

1415
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:52,520
If you go to jokeymerch.com...

1416
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,500
You can see it's up now.

1417
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,240
Alright, jokeymerch.com.

1418
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,160
Oh, it's not even...

1419
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,700
Guys, I don't know if I'm good at being a streamer anymore.

1420
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,540
I'm not...

1421
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,320
Alright, here we go.

1422
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,500
It should be...

1423
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,340
69.69.

1424
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,460
There we go.

1425
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,980
I hope the limit is still working.

1426
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,360
But that should be everything.

1427
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,100
Let me do the...

1428
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,240
Oh yeah, he even gave me like...

1429
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,340
A step-by-step guide on how to do this.

1430
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:29,820
Because I never had to do this myself.

1431
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,340
Oh my god, how do I do this?

1432
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:34,240
He sent me screenshots and everything too.

1433
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,460
He was like...

1434
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,220
Here's the instructions...

1435
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:39,620
On how to add sliders.

1436
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,280
And I was like, oh my god.

1437
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,020
I have to do this myself.

1438
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,100
And then...

1439
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,760
They were like, that's your own fault.

1440
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,160
You didn't have to do this yourself.

1441
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,120
Wait, is it already sold out?

1442
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,440
Oh my god, that's crazy.

1443
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,600
I'm sorry, I can't add more inventory.

1444
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:56,880
My manager would yell at me.

1445
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,460
Because he didn't trust me.

1446
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:02,690
Sorry.

1447
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:05,450
We have regular voice pack.

1448
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:07,790
We have the regular one, guys.

1449
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:08,850
I'm so sorry.

1450
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:10,630
He doesn't trust me.

1451
01:20:10,730 --> 01:20:13,510
He was like, we're adding this amount.

1452
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:14,790
I don't trust you.

1453
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:16,830
And I was like, okay.

1454
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:20,710
I'm sorry, guys.

1455
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,770
I would add more if I could.

1456
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:25,870
But I don't want him to be mad.

1457
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:30,050
I don't want him to be mad at me.

1458
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:31,510
Okay.

1459
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:34,630
Let me get the product in.

1460
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,130
Of the other voice pack.

1461
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,010
Where is it?

1462
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,750
Okay, there you go.

1463
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:39,550
Yay!

1464
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:40,790
Did it work?

1465
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:42,610
Is it up on the site?

1466
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,450
I did it.

1467
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:44,930
I put it up myself.

1468
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:47,450
Is it up there?

1469
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:49,410
Oh my god.

1470
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:50,350
There was an error.

1471
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:51,790
Wait, is it?

1472
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:52,570
Did I fix it?

1473
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:55,110
What happened to this?

1474
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:56,110
Oh, no.

1475
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:58,530
I fucked it up.

1476
01:20:59,050 --> 01:20:59,690
Don't tell him.

1477
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,150
Don't tell him.

1478
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:05,330
I fucked up the store.

1479
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:10,870
Oh, no.

1480
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:13,470
What did I do to the store?

1481
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:14,470
Don't tell him.

1482
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:16,710
I'm gonna fix it.

1483
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:19,490
I'm gonna fix it.

1484
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:20,130
Why?

1485
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:22,070
Why is there a fucked up URL?

1486
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:23,970
Where is that?

1487
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:25,850
What is that?

1488
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:27,250
Is it this?

1489
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,090
Oh, it was this, right?

1490
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:33,350
Why is it like that?

1491
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:34,790
Guys, don't tell him.

1492
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:36,150
Shh, it's our little secret.

1493
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:37,670
Guys, don't tell him.

1494
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:39,390
Shh.

1495
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,230
Shh, it's our little secret.

1496
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:50,390
That's why your manager doesn't trust you.

1497
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:54,350
What he doesn't know won't hurt him.

1498
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:55,890
Okay, I fixed it.

1499
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:58,730
I fixed it, guys.

1500
01:21:58,970 --> 01:21:59,690
I did it.

1501
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:00,550
There we go.

1502
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:02,810
Did it actually already sold out?

1503
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:03,830
That's crazy.

1504
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,570
Alright.

1505
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:12,810
If I can somehow convince my manager that I am a responsible adult, maybe he'll let me add more inventory later.

1506
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:16,590
But for now, I can't because he might yell at me.

1507
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:25,810
If we do add more inventory, I'll let you know.

1508
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:30,790
Because he's like, I don't even trust you to get that X amount.

1509
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:37,130
What if I just add one more?

1510
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:38,090
Guys, how would he know?

1511
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:41,210
I'm gonna add one more, guys.

1512
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:44,770
What if I just add one more?

1513
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:45,210
You know what?

1514
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:46,470
I'm gonna do it.

1515
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:48,150
I'm gonna add one more.

1516
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:49,230
He won't know.

1517
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:50,510
How is he gonna know?

1518
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:54,670
Mods, do not snitch me out, mods.

1519
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:56,490
I swear to god.

1520
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:58,110
Don't do it.

1521
01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,370
Don't snitch me out.

1522
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:00,550
How do I do it?

1523
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:02,830
I don't know how to add one more.

1524
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:04,070
Okay.

1525
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:06,310
One.

1526
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,870
I added one more, guys.

1527
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:10,090
I did it.

1528
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:14,250
Guys, I did it.

1529
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,290
I added one more.

1530
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:18,870
I'll just be like, oops.

1531
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:26,050
Don't freak us.

1532
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,810
Guys, mods, come on.

1533
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:32,750
Don't snitch me out to the head honcho.

1534
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:35,390
Guys, oh my god, it's already gone?

1535
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,770
Holy shit.

1536
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:39,750
Okay, we do have the regular ones, though.

1537
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:41,750
We have the regular pack.

1538
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:43,570
Guys, I can't.

1539
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:48,290
Guys, I need to be able to convince my manager that I can...

1540
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,930
I don't know if I can.

1541
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:51,030
I'm sorry.

1542
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:52,350
I'm sorry.

1543
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:53,410
I'm scared.

1544
01:23:57,050 --> 01:23:58,950
Today, he was like...

1545
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:01,470
He was like, we are not adding more.

1546
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:02,830
But I was like, I can do it.

1547
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:03,470
I swear.

1548
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,670
I could swear I could do it.

1549
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,170
And then he was like...

1550
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:09,690
He was like, I don't believe you anymore.

1551
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,940
So I can't.

1552
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:17,200
I can't add another.

1553
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,220
I cannot.

1554
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,800
I cannot add more.

1555
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,540
I cannot do it.

1556
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,240
Anyway...

1557
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,350
He's a real friend.

1558
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:39,410
So... Okay, but what if I add one more?

1559
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:41,270
Okay, I'm gonna add another one.

1560
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,310
I'll do two more.

1561
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:42,870
Okay, guys.

1562
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:43,430
Two more.

1563
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:45,130
I'll just be like...

1564
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:46,410
Two more, guys.

1565
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:47,010
Two more.

1566
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:47,530
It'll be fine.

1567
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:48,410
This is the last one.

1568
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:50,110
This is the last one, guys.

1569
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:51,570
Two more is the last one.

1570
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:53,030
Two more.

1571
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:54,690
It's like plus three.

1572
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,650
Guys, it's plus three.

1573
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:58,150
What's the worst that could happen?

1574
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:58,790
I did it.

1575
01:24:58,810 --> 01:24:59,730
I added two more.

1576
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:02,310
Don't snitch on me!

1577
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:03,930
He's not gonna have... No!

1578
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:07,830
He doesn't have access to the analytics of the store.

1579
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:11,270
My store manager has the analytics of the store.

1580
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:13,970
So, like, she won't snitch on me.

1581
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:15,950
Because I pay her too.

1582
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:18,250
She's not even awake, right?

1583
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:19,090
She might be awake.

1584
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:22,410
She's not watching the stream right now so she doesn't know the details of this.

1585
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:30,090
Because I only told the details to my main manager, but the store manager she doesn't know.

1586
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:34,730
She was in charge of shipping some of the old stuff, so she doesn't know.

1587
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:36,730
So she's the only one that has access to that.

1588
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:39,470
So, she's not gonna snitch on me.

1589
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:46,790
Yeah, but he's not gonna count 50.

1590
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,730
He's not... Yeah, alright.

1591
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:49,450
Okay, no more.

1592
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:50,070
No more, guys.

1593
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:50,650
I can't.

1594
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:51,710
I can't, guys.

1595
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:54,670
We already went beyond my limits.

1596
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:57,010
No, we do not snitch here!

1597
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:58,530
This is a safe zone!

1598
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,790
This is a... He's asleep!

1599
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:02,610
He's not gonna know!

1600
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:03,390
He's asleep!

1601
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:05,370
This is my safe place right now!

1602
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:16,970
Guys, this is my safe place!

1603
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:18,330
Guys, please!

1604
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:20,950
He's not awake!

1605
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:22,650
This is my safe space!

1606
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:28,350
You don't even know how to contact my manager!

1607
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:30,330
You don't even know!

1608
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:33,410
He's not gonna know!

1609
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:34,890
I'll just be like...

1610
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:35,450
Oh, man!

1611
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:37,710
My chat kept begging me!

1612
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,810
And like...

1613
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,710
You know I'm so easily persuadable!

1614
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:43,730
And I'm gonna blame you guys!

1615
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:48,090
If you tell him, I'm gonna throw you under the bus!

1616
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:50,430
Because you threw me under the bus!

1617
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:54,390
That's fucking right!

1618
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:55,870
You think I won't do it?

1619
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:59,030
I'll throw you under the bus with me!

1620
01:26:59,030 --> 01:26:59,530
I...

1621
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,290
She has a point!

1622
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:05,890
You wouldn't!

1623
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,210
That's fucking right!

1624
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:10,190
I'll pin you down with me!

1625
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:11,450
Yes!

1626
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:16,230
Uno mas 10, please!

1627
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:17,950
Thank you for the super chat!

1628
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:18,650
Thank you!

1629
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:19,550
Thank you!

1630
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:21,570
That's fucking right!

1631
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:23,430
That's right!

1632
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:26,510
We all go down together!

1633
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:31,630
Yeah, that's fucking right!

1634
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:34,190
I ain't going down by alone!

1635
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:35,070
Alright!

1636
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,160
Don't threaten me with a good time!

1637
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:40,810
Alright, that was fucking...

1638
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:41,710
That was a wild...

1639
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:45,550
It's been fucking wild, honestly!

1640
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:50,190
I had a great time!

1641
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:50,750
Oh, my God!

1642
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,710
Oh, my God!

1643
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:52,450
Did you guys see?

1644
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:53,330
There's a teaser!

1645
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:56,970
You guys made so much amazing content for me!

1646
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:58,710
Like, fanart, music...

1647
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:03,530
Did you guys see a sneak peek of a game that people were working on?

1648
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:04,610
Did you guys see that?

1649
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,350
I was like, holy shit!

1650
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:06,890
Okay, wait.

1651
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:07,830
I need to show you guys.

1652
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:08,870
Where was it?

1653
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,210
It was on Doki Day.

1654
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:12,130
Somebody made, like, a Bomberman!

1655
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:14,530
It's making a Bomberman game!

1656
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:16,070
I was like, holy fuck!

1657
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:17,170
That's so cool!

1658
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:19,750
I was like, I'm so excited to play!

1659
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:20,970
I fucking love Bomberman!

1660
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:28,570
I wish, like, you know, the actual Bomberman game's netcode isn't fucking bad, but, like, dog shit, but, like, other than that...

1661
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:30,390
Yeah!

1662
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:31,810
I'm trying to find it.

1663
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:35,010
There's a lot of tweets here, so, like, I'm really bad at this.

1664
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,070
But, like, I'm bad at a lot of things.

1665
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:37,970
Oh, here it is, guys!

1666
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:38,530
Look at this!

1667
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:40,250
No, right?

1668
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:41,170
It's actually been a year.

1669
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:42,010
It's actually crazy.

1670
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:42,550
Look at this!

1671
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,210
It's so cool!

1672
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:45,390
I'm so excited!

1673
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:47,130
I'm actually really excited for this.

1674
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:58,850
I fucking love Bomberman, but I feel like a lot of the recent Bomberman games, the, like, the netcode is so bad that you can't even, like, play Bomberman online very well.

1675
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:00,150
So, like, yeah!

1676
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:02,150
It looks really, really, really cool.

1677
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:03,110
I'm super excited.

1678
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:05,050
There's so much amazing artwork and everything.

1679
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:06,570
Guys, thank you, guys.

1680
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:09,770
I know I don't thank like, personal thank yous on Twitter and stuff.

1681
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:16,010
I'm really sorry to all the creative people that support me with their amazing artwork and, like, music, games, and everything.

1682
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:21,990
Like, um, I'm so bad at, like, replying to people, especially, like, even people I know.

1683
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:28,510
Like, I personally know I'm really bad at replying to people on Twitter because, like, I'm so used to being a lurker for a majority of my life.

1684
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:29,630
That is so hard.

1685
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:35,410
Like, and also, like, when I'm really busy, like, I just don't, I just, like, don't message people.

1686
01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:38,370
Like, I like talking to people.

1687
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:39,730
I don't, like, I don't know.

1688
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:42,950
I like talking to people, like, vocally versus, like, messages.

1689
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:44,530
Um, I'll give an example.

1690
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:55,030
So, like, um, Ray messaged me about something, like, I was, like, in Valkyrie, uh, to, like, apologize about, like, how, like, the Twitch Rivals thing was going on, and I didn't reply.

1691
01:29:55,890 --> 01:30:01,610
I didn't reply back for, like, a week plus because, like, I had to plan my Japan trip.

1692
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:02,850
I was like, it's not your fault.

1693
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:03,670
It was Twitch's fault.

1694
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:08,310
I was like, no, bro, like, I'm not, like, like, like, no, I don't blame you.

1695
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:14,150
It was, like, it was Twitch that, like, all the stuff that happened, like, they shouldn't have done all the change, real change.

1696
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:28,030
And she was, like, and then the thing is, I didn't reply back within a week plus because I had to do my Japan trip and I was, like, planning for that and I was, like, so overwhelmed with everything and then after Japan trip was over, like, I replied back and then she was,

1697
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:33,950
like, oh my god, I thought you hated me and then I was, like, oh, no, I'm sorry.

1698
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:39,430
I legit, like, legit, I just, I'm just really bad at messaging people.

1699
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:40,410
I'm so...

1700
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:42,010
I was, like, I don't hate you.

1701
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:48,270
Like, like, don't keep on ghosting Valkyrie and I'm, like, I'm sorry.

1702
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:49,770
It's not you.

1703
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:51,790
I do this to everybody.

1704
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:53,070
It's not you.

1705
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:01,930
I felt so bad.

1706
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:06,930
I was, like, I just, like, I'll reply to her tomorrow and it never happened until I came back from Japan.

1707
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:17,830
That's why I'm really, I'm really sorry that, like, I'm so bad at communicating.

1708
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:20,850
I have really bad communication skills.

1709
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:29,650
Also, I forgot to say, huge shout out to Sirius DV for doing the subtitles for No Matter What.

1710
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:38,330
If you guys checked theirs, I want, if you guys want to translate this, if you guys have, like, the translated lyrics of the song in other languages, please let me know.

1711
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:55,450
Feel free to link it and, like, add me on Twitter and then, like, you know, if it's in Japanese or Chinese or, like, Spanish or anything, I can have the subtitle person to make subtitles for it, closed captioning for other languages for those who want it.

1712
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:58,830
Obviously, I do need the official lyrics for it.

1713
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:06,290
I don't even know what, I don't know where to get the official lyrics for the other, for because it isn't an actual song and I'm pretty sure there is official lyrics for it.

1714
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:16,010
So, like, if anybody has, like, a link to the actual official lyrics, like, just feel free to send it to me and then I can have it put as a subtitle.

1715
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:21,890
But, yes, thank you for all the Akasupas and all those superchats and, in general, and all the memberships and everybody and subscribing.

1716
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:23,950
Rosie, thank you for the Akasupa.

1717
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:24,770
Thank you, thank you.

1718
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:25,810
Thank you for being here, Doki.

1719
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:27,330
Here's to another great year.

1720
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:27,950
Thank you.

1721
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:29,070
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1722
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:30,150
Thank you, thank you.

1723
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:32,530
Yeah, there were so many announcements.

1724
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:38,390
I still don't think I had a lot of stuff going on for, like, this today's stream, but...

1725
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:51,670
But I'm glad a lot of you guys had a great time with watching and hanging out with me today for this year.

1726
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:55,930
But it's really been a wild fucking year.

1727
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:57,990
We had so many announcements.

1728
01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:00,190
We had so many merch announcements in general.

1729
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:06,310
Like, other than, like, you know, the wallpaper, the official wallpaper, and the custom voice packs.

1730
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:06,810
That's already sold.

1731
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:07,430
I can't, guys.

1732
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:08,530
I cannot add more inventory.

1733
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:09,350
I'm so sorry.

1734
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:11,230
I don't want to get yelled at.

1735
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:12,030
I really...

1736
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:13,730
I really don't.

1737
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:20,750
And then the official Gina Draws uh... Gina Draws pajama set with the eye mask.

1738
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:28,890
And then we have the uh... and then we have this that's coming out soon but not this month, so you guys don't have to worry.

1739
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:34,590
And then we have uh... this that is officially out on GoodSmile website.

1740
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:35,870
And then... oh yes!

1741
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:36,970
I saw the trophy too!

1742
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:38,150
There were so many cool things!

1743
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:45,710
And then we also have, you know, we also have the... this model that's out now, right now, that you can download.

1744
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:46,790
Um...

1745
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:49,770
and then we also have uh... haha.

1746
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:51,310
Oh yeah, let me check.

1747
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:53,170
People made, like, the official trophy.

1748
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:54,830
It looks so cool!

1749
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:57,290
Um... yeah, I saw it.

1750
01:33:57,330 --> 01:33:58,750
I was like, oh my god.

1751
01:33:58,930 --> 01:33:59,590
Oh my god.

1752
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:00,670
You guys are all so talented.

1753
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:02,930
It's actually crazy how talented you are.

1754
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:08,970
Uh... and then we have the cover song of With Mint, the No Matter What.

1755
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:14,510
Like I said, I chose that song because I felt a deep connection to that song in general.

1756
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:18,750
Um, because I felt like it really reflected how that year was like.

1757
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:22,390
Well, not the year, but you know, the events leading to that year.

1758
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:24,670
It really felt like it...

1759
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:26,890
um...

1760
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:30,790
um... it really it felt like, uh...

1761
01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:46,350
you know, a lot of stuff happened that the events leading to it and it really connected well to me and you know, the events afterwards and I'm just happy to actually cover this song.

1762
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:53,610
I'm really happy that this was a song that I was able to sing and that Mint really wanted to sing that song with me.

1763
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:54,810
Um, but yes.

1764
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:55,490
What a year.

1765
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,550
What a fucking year.

1766
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:57,110
Yeah.

1767
01:34:57,610 --> 01:35:00,590
And then also the bait and switch video that I did for you guys.

1768
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:01,510
Uh...

1769
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:07,610
Um...

1770
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:09,790
Um...

1771
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:10,870
Um...

1772
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:12,150
Um...

1773
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:12,310
Um...

1774
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:13,950
But yeah, it was...

1775
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:17,270
Is this where I get the voice back?

1776
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:18,170
Voice back!

1777
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:19,030
Don't go!

1778
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:21,710
Thank you for the magenta soup.

1779
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:23,790
Oh no, he's coping.

1780
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:24,970
He's coping.

1781
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,650
He's like, please, please, just one more.

1782
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:28,930
He's not gonna know.

1783
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:30,750
I won't tell him.

1784
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,190
Just add one more doggy.

1785
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:34,370
He's not gonna know.

1786
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:35,450
He's gonna know!

1787
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:37,790
Guys, I have... He's gonna know.

1788
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:38,590
I can't!

1789
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:45,050
Thank you for the aqua soup.

1790
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:46,050
Thank you, thank you.

1791
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:47,430
It was a perfect song choice.

1792
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:48,810
I'm so happy you guys sing it together.

1793
01:35:49,230 --> 01:35:49,710
What a year.

1794
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:50,810
Thank you for the aqua soup.

1795
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:52,550
Thank you, thank you.

1796
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:56,230
He's gonna know.

1797
01:35:56,410 --> 01:35:57,430
I can't, guys!

1798
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:58,770
I already added three!

1799
01:35:59,470 --> 01:36:00,450
I can't!

1800
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:04,650
But yes, what a fucking wild year.

1801
01:36:04,810 --> 01:36:11,910
But like I said, I'm happy to spend that insanely wild year with you guys.

1802
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:14,690
I said a lot in that voice back too.

1803
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:18,170
I might repeat what I just said in that voice back.

1804
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:23,550
Guys, I can't keep bribing him with Marvel Rivals, guys.

1805
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:24,530
I can't!

1806
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:25,610
I can't, like...

1807
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:28,470
I can't keep... I can't!

1808
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:32,430
Guys, there's a limit to how much Marvel Rivals rank I can give him.

1809
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:34,810
There's a limit...

1810
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:44,190
But it was...

1811
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:47,750
Like I said, I wouldn't be able to do all of this without your support and everything.

1812
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:51,630
I hope we can do get a million subscribers by the end of this year.

1813
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:52,630
That is my biggest goal.

1814
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:57,570
I really wish... love to get a million subscribers by the end of this year.

1815
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:02,350
And I really want to achieve much, much...

1816
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,150
many, many, many more things with you guys.

1817
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:08,710
And continue doing content creation with my dragoons, if you think about it.

1818
01:37:08,710 --> 01:37:10,030
I've been doing this for a while now.

1819
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:14,350
And I'm still... I'm always worried I'm gonna run out of ideas one day.

1820
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:17,350
But for now, I'm still chugging along.

1821
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:18,970
But thank you everybody.

1822
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:21,790
I'm just thinking like, oh man.

1823
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:26,910
I know I could say more but I feel like I said so much more already.

1824
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:29,590
But thank you dragoons and thank you for everything.

1825
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:34,910
And I hope you guys had a great time celebrating my anniversary... our anniversary.

1826
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:35,710
It's not even mine.

1827
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:36,830
It's our anniversary.

1828
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:38,890
Together.

1829
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:44,290
And I guess to like... I guess to end this whole thing...

1830
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:45,990
Let's just watch that video.

1831
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:47,310
I think it's a pretty funny video.

1832
01:37:47,370 --> 01:37:48,390
We could just...

1833
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:54,550
I guess we end it off on the video and then we'll go to the ending screen.

1834
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:54,930
Alright.

1835
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:55,950
Alright guys.

1836
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,370
Thank you as always everybody.

1837
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:58,370
Stay hydrated.

1838
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:59,090
Pause to check.

1839
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,270
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1840
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:04,930
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed cause you deserve it.

1841
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:06,630
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

1842
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:07,990
Bye guys.

1843
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:08,550
Bye!

1844
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:09,770
Tomorrow's stream's cancelled.

1845
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:11,230
Cause like...

1846
01:38:11,230 --> 01:38:13,610
I can't piss him off anymore.

1847
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:15,010
So...

1848
01:38:15,010 --> 01:38:20,390
Thank you all for the superchats and the memberships and the subscribing and watching and like...

1849
01:38:20,990 --> 01:38:22,290
6 seasons and a movie.

1850
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:23,950
I don't wanna say 10 more years.

1851
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:24,890
I don't know guys.

1852
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:27,730
I...

1853
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:29,690
6 seasons and a movie.

1854
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:30,530
Alright.

1855
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:32,870
Finally!

1856
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:40,830
After the long wait since that concert, I can finally announce something that everyone has been waiting for.

1857
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:44,370
The most polygons you've ever seen!

1858
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:48,850
A debut that's been anticipated for years!

1859
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:52,590
My official 3D debut!

1860
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:59,550
With special guests, special performances, special everything!

1861
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:03,350
And the debut is...

1862
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:05,630
right now!

1863
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:06,850
Ha ha ha!

1864
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:09,210
It's finally here!

1865
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:11,050
Look, dragoons!

1866
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:13,430
I'm 3D now!

1867
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:16,370
Look at these movements!

1868
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:16,950
Whoa!

1869
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:23,170
That new 5090 RTX on is hitting hard.

1870
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:25,690
Wait...

1871
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:27,190
Is this not the Doki you wanted?

1872
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:31,230
I mean, you can't get any more 3D than this.

1873
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:33,030
I told you.

1874
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:34,750
Anime girls are real.

1875
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:37,470
Come on, look at these close-ups.

1876
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:38,690
Whoa!

1877
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:41,530
Look at this!

1878
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:42,730
And this!

1879
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,630
It looks like real leather!

1880
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:48,470
Wait, I know.

1881
01:39:49,210 --> 01:39:51,030
You're expecting something else, right?

1882
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:53,750
Okay, fine, fine.

1883
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:59,750
I guess you dragoons deserve a real 3D debut.

1884
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:03,210
It is my one-year anniversary.

1885
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:12,830
Now, what you're actually waiting for, my real 3D debut!

1886
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:15,570
Ha ha ha!

1887
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:16,910
That's right!

1888
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,110
It's me!

1889
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:19,990
Retro Doki!

1890
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:24,190
Man, 3D graphics go hard now.

1891
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:25,610
What?

1892
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:28,350
Is this not the 3D debut you're looking for?

1893
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:31,750
But it looks and feels so real.

1894
01:40:32,210 --> 01:40:35,810
I mean, if you zoom in, you might even see some of my pores.

1895
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:38,390
Oh, I see!

1896
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:41,610
You wanted me in something else, right?

1897
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:43,590
Like her?

1898
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:48,810
Hey, dragoons, is this the 3D Doki you wanted?

1899
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:55,910
I mean, I am the best Doki that everyone wants to see.

1900
01:40:55,910 --> 01:41:00,350
All Doki is best girl, just like Cathy.

1901
01:41:00,710 --> 01:41:02,870
Okay, okay, enough of her!

1902
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:05,270
We don't want you to forget about me!

1903
01:41:06,570 --> 01:41:09,970
Look, I'm fucking with you guys, okay?

1904
01:41:10,590 --> 01:41:11,790
I know what you're here for.

1905
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:16,670
Here is the real 3D debut!

1906
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:19,550
Ha ha ha!

1907
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:21,810
Doesn't get more 3D than this!

1908
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:23,090
That's right!

1909
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:25,130
My true form!

1910
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,250
Tomato Doki bird!

1911
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:29,190
What do you think?

1912
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:30,530
Yeah?

1913
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:33,750
I grew a little bit bigger than a regular tomato.

1914
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:38,850
I think a year ago, I was this size.

1915
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:42,710
Alright, alright, dragoons.

1916
01:41:43,010 --> 01:41:44,170
No more baiting.

1917
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:45,390
I'm not gonna bait anymore.

1918
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:47,530
Are you guys ready?

1919
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:52,270
In three, two, one!

1920
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:54,830
My real 3D debut!

1921
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:06,750
Well, here I am, the real Doki.

1922
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:13,190
I mean, what gets realer than this?

1923
01:42:13,990 --> 01:42:18,530
Well, I hope you guys enjoyed my 3D debut!

1924
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:21,920
Happy one year anniversary, dragoons!

1925
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:25,550
Caw caw!

1926
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:36,430
Thank you, everybody, for coming to my first year anniversary since I came back.

1927
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:38,330
Surprise!

1928
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:40,470
I guess that's all I had planned.

1929
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:43,250
I'm joking, I'm joking!

1930
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:44,870
There's more announcements later!

1931
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:46,330
Caw caw!

1932
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:47,450
Croaky out!

1933
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:47,990
Bye!

1934
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:51,690
Sorry, there's no actual 3D debut.

1935
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:54,250
That was just the longest beta switch I've ever done.

1936
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:55,110
Bye bye!

1937
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:57,770
Also, here's me with a cowboy hat!

1938
01:42:57,930 --> 01:42:58,570
Yeehaw!

1939
01:42:59,010 --> 01:43:00,750
Caw caw!

1940
01:43:00,770 --> 01:43:01,770
Alright, bye!

1941
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,230
I fly away now.

1942
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:04,230
Woo!
