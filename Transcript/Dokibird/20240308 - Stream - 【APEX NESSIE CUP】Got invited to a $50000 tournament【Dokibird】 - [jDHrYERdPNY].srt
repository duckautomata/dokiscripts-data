1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,960
I'm live!

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,960
Hello everybody!

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,820
I have two people here with me today for the Nessie Cup Tournament!

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,860
Would you guys like to introduce yourselves?

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,400
This is going to be my forever team for today.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,890
Oh wait, sorry, they can't hear you.

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,910
My description is weird.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,250
It's okay, I'll listen to your creepy names.

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,370
You can go now.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,770
Now I'm scared.

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:40,810
Oh wait.

12
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,090
Sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,330
Hi, I'm Himi, or Himalayas, but call me Himi.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,570
Happy to be here.

15
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,990
Hey, Senox, you're next!

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,050
Hi, my name is Senox.

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,270
I play competitive 8-packs.

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,150
I don't know, that's about it.

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,610
He's the guy that looks like Gibraltar IRL.

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,790
For the game.

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,110
For those who are wondering, we've talked about him before.

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,930
What team are we?

23
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,090
Team 6?

24
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,130
Yeah, we're Team 6.

25
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,430
Wait, we're IRL.

26
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,170
We got Countdown.

27
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,630
We got Countdown?

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,290
Not at all.

29
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,530
Wait, that's pretty good.

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,070
Pretty good.

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,670
We were discussing strats earlier.

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,930
Is the challenge public yet?

33
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,250
Or is it still only on stream?

34
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,690
I had the thing open on my stream.

35
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,130
Oh, okay.

36
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,290
I'm just gonna put it on my... Oh my god, I can put images on my stream now.

37
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,410
I wasn't able to in the past.

38
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,710
But yeah, we were discussing our challenges, what we're doing and stuff.

39
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,230
So...

40
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,590
Have we decided who's gonna be doing what yet?

41
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,030
Um...

42
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,830
You gonna put him again?

43
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:56,990
Nah, I mean...

44
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,310
For the most part, I think the only individual ones that matter is the FOV and no attachments.

45
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,150
Yeah, so...

46
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,370
But hey, everybody can do whatever.

47
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,410
You just pick up like a sniper, you just do whatever.

48
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,750
So like, we delegated Heemi to be the 90 FOV, cause she's not streaming.

49
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,110
So chat... she doesn't have chat to go through 90 FOV.

50
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,810
And other than that, we tried to decide who's gonna do the no attachments and the P20 gun.

51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,340
Any volunteers?

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,460
Who's playing Wraith?

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,780
Who's gonna get the kidnap off?

54
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,020
I think so.

55
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,080
I think Senox is doing the Wraith thing, right?

56
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,060
Oh, beautiful.

57
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:36,860
Yeah.

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,700
Oh my gosh, there's also... wait, there's a comp challenge in here too.

59
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,460
Yeah, it's Valkyrie Caustic.

60
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,060
Yeah, but it's just one point.

61
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,680
Because it's like, either you do the Wraith or you do... you get like one point off of the comp.

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,460
How am I... what are they... there's only one Wraith one also, right?

63
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,880
Yeah, there's only one Wraith, so it's either one or the other.

64
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,640
I feel like... I think Senox is right.

65
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,540
We should probably just do like our own comp because like... for the ammo and shield cells and all that.

66
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:07,980
Definitely.

67
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,900
Yeah.

68
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,980
Hold on, I'm being cringe.

69
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm getting a loop off.

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,580
That's not good.

71
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,380
I think it's... PY's are changing every game, right?

72
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,100
I don't think so.

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,880
Well, it's different.

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:30,700
I think maybe World's Edge we get like countdown the entire time and then Stormpoint we get like a different... obviously different POI.

75
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,680
I mean, we could always ask Tempo.

76
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,310
Also chat, how's the volume for everybody?

77
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,270
I hate audio balancing.

78
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,750
Oh guys, this is not bingo.

79
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:55,010
It's basically whoever does the most challenges per game or win the game gets like money.

80
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,810
Gets like a thousand five hundred per team.

81
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,550
So it's not bingo, it's just whoever does the most challenges.

82
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, he needs a little low.

83
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,220
Oh, he needs a little low.

84
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,680
Okay, let me boost up Hini's volume.

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,620
Boop.

86
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:16,800
Test.

87
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,120
Can you screen... like can you...

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
Get up your mic for us.

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,000
Wait, I think it's good.

90
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,800
Cause I don't know.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,020
Okay, yeah, yeah, wait, I think you're good.

92
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,700
I think you're good.

93
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,260
Test.

94
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
Oh, we're not countdown.

96
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,860
Don't you carry?

97
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,840
We're tree.

98
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,460
We're not... we're tree?

99
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,660
The map said team six countdown.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,160
But we're team six.

101
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,540
Wait, who has countdown?

102
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,060
Wait, team two has countdown.

103
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,120
Wait, what?

104
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,780
Wait, Doop is a bastard.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,320
Guy stole our POI.

106
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
I mean, tree, tree's fine.

107
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,740
Wait, how... how the fuck did...

108
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,400
Numbers don't matter.

109
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,300
Oh my gosh, how do you buy the new loop path?

110
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,440
Rigged!

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,540
I mean, tree is... tree's really easy.

112
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,780
I know, I like it.

113
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,460
I like tree, honestly.

114
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,020
It's good for the game.

115
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,580
Are we doing rampart, Loba, raids still?

116
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,720
Yes, I think so.

117
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,220
Okay.

118
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,860
What are we using the rampart for?

119
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,640
Damage?

120
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,700
We're just doing it for knocking people to damage.

121
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,560
We could just drop rampart for like, watson or something.

122
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,920
Because meds might be a problem.

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,940
I mean, I could do...

124
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,000
It's preference whoever's playing that character.

125
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:19,940
Uh...

126
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,480
I can do... I can do any of them.

127
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,360
Watson, caustic, or rampart.

128
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,900
So it really depends on which is the best one.

129
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,120
I mean, caustic's like hard, meta, and uncom, but...

130
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,240
I don't know how competitive this is gonna be.

131
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,120
I think if... I mean...

132
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,980
I think it's gonna be sweaty.

133
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,620
I feel like... I mean...

134
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,800
Not gonna lie, but some teams are very imbalanced.

135
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,880
Yeah, some of the teams are really imbalanced.

136
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,100
I played like... I streamed Apex once last week, so...

137
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,360
So these teams are pretty imbalanced.

138
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,720
We're playing the game on easy mode.

139
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,620
We're sitting center zone.

140
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,720
Mimi, I nominate you to do no attachments.

141
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,340
Okay.

142
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,260
On my d20?

143
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,060
You're supposed to fight back!

144
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,880
You're not just supposed to accept it!

145
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,500
Hell nah, Dokie.

146
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,720
That's some bullsh...

147
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,580
I don't think you are.

148
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,980
I can't believe you would do this.

149
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,420
I've just met you, but you should do the no attachments.

150
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,020
Since you think you know everything.

151
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,440
Are you an IGL?

152
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,000
Senox, who should do it?

153
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,200
No, Senox, you pick!

154
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,380
You're the IGL.

155
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,780
Who's worse?

156
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,380
Realistically, who's worse?

157
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,580
If we wanna be real.

158
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,560
What's your rating?

159
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,360
If you want me to choose, that's what I'm saying.

160
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,380
What's your rank, Mimi?

161
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,560
Unfortunately, who is worse?

162
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,420
I am not the IGL.

163
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,360
It's definitely one of y'all.

164
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,180
Yes, IGL is telling us who is the worst player out of the two of us, Mimi.

165
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,700
What's your rank?

166
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,020
Oh, I'm like diamond-ish?

167
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,620
I don't know.

168
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Higher rank than me.

169
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,740
Whoa!

170
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
Not right now!

171
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,940
Oh my gosh, currently?

172
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,500
Today?

173
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,660
Yeah, currently today.

174
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,860
What's your rank today?

175
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,880
No, I'm like...

176
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,920
What am I?

177
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,660
Gold?

178
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,720
Oh, thank god, I'm plat right now.

179
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay, Mimi, you can tell.

180
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,860
Evil.

181
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
Oh, no, shut up.

182
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,060
I'm plat right now, so...

183
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,240
You're goaded, so you're the actual...

184
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,420
The lowest ranked... the lowest ranked member should play the no attachments in P20.

185
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,900
Yeah, there we go.

186
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,800
There we go.

187
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,740
We figured it out.

188
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,740
What's your rank, Senox?

189
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,040
Yeah, what's your rank, Senox?

190
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,020
I got Mastiffs when the season came out.

191
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,840
Or I got Predator when the season came out and I haven't played it since.

192
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,680
Oh.

193
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,880
So you are a Master?

194
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,540
So he's Masters.

195
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:38,840
Probably Masters.

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,140
Yeah, so he's still the highest rank.

197
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,640
Highest rank IGL.

198
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,100
It's the rule.

199
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,840
I sent you the thing.

200
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,780
It's pretty easy.

201
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,220
It's Shriek.

202
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,780
Whoever's on beacon character, you just loot mid and hit beacon.

203
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,340
Okay.

204
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,320
Someone else hits Logram.

205
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,820
Someone else hits the other side.

206
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,880
My thing...

207
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,880
Watson, Rampart, or Caustic?

208
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:57,980
IGL.

209
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,540
It's up to me.

210
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,660
Whichever one you want to play.

211
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,440
I don't think it matters.

212
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,820
I mean, Rampart, we could use it to get more...

213
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,900
more sniper knocks and like overall damage.

214
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,920
Caustic would just be better for actually winning games.

215
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,620
Yeah, but like we're not here to win games.

216
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,480
True.

217
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,560
We're here to do challenges.

218
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,180
Does Watson do anything for any of these?

219
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,660
An Arcstar stick?

220
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,380
You could turn all your nades into Arcstars.

221
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,840
Um...

222
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:32,650
Alright.

223
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,010
Okay, so...

224
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,650
I guess it's all RNG on how many meds we get, honestly.

225
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:36,990
Okay.

226
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,850
I'll just pick up Rampart then.

227
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,250
If there's... or...

228
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,510
I'll just pick up Rampart then just for the damage padding.

229
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,210
If we're doing... I mean, it'll be good for snipers if we're doing damage padding.

230
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,430
Yeah.

231
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,310
Yeah.

232
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,830
Use your ult three times.

233
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,430
What... how do I... oh wait, Loba.

234
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,250
That'll be fast for Loba.

235
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:57,750
W.

236
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,110
Yeah.

237
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,070
I feel like we should do the Evo Harvester like instantly.

238
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,450
Just travel... travel to all the Evo Harvesters.

239
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,710
Yeah, we can just hit them on the way.

240
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,450
We can hit them on the way.

241
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:07,910
Yeah.

242
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,510
Okay.

243
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,190
I guess it all just depends where the zone is.

244
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,190
Cause if it's across the map, we could just play like... you know what I mean?

245
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,370
It just depends where the zone is.

246
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,350
We'll have to use our evac towers.

247
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,790
Our three evac towers.

248
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,330
Yeah.

249
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,950
Oh, and we have a Loba to get those Eva towers.

250
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,490
Oh my god.

251
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,030
We can use three evacs at the same time.

252
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,250
We're thinking...

253
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,580
We were supposed to start our game like nine minutes ago.

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,000
We're the...

255
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
Who is not here?

256
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,720
Wait, girl's not here.

257
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,740
Girl, the host isn't here in the lobby.

258
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,590
I mean in my mic.

259
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,070
Actually, I think we'll play Wattson.

260
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,410
Oh shit, nevermind.

261
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:11,210
If a lot of the people are playing Gibby Kossack for the challenge, we're like actually gonna get took by Gibby Kossack out without Wattson.

262
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,790
Yeah.

263
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,710
That is... that is so smart.

264
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,610
I nominate Doki to play Wattson.

265
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,350
Oh my god.

266
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,870
That's good cause I was gonna nominate myself anyway.

267
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,230
Thank you.

268
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,070
You're welcome.

269
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,810
Yeah, I can do Wattson.

270
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,230
I used to play her.

271
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,530
She's so cute.

272
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,100
I love her.

273
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,980
Where is girl?

274
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,040
Girl, where are you?

275
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
You're the host.

276
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,040
Alright, I muted my mic.

277
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm so anxious.

278
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,480
They're so serious.

279
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,680
Bro, they're like... they're like metachronistic.

280
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,420
I wanted to do her crafting earlier before I started this stream.

281
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,820
I was just like, hey!

282
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,020
The anxiety.

283
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,840
You know, I found out that wasn't a th- okay, by participating, we each get like $500.

284
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,940
I thought we'd get $1,500.

285
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,120
I was like, fuck yeah!

286
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,860
I don't care how well we do, we get a thousand five hundred dollars each.

287
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:46,460
And then I realized I can't read and it actually says every team gets a thousand five hundred so I get five hundred dollars I get five hundred for participating and just being there which is great because that means if I cuz there's three tournaments So that means if I sign up for all three Technically I can get a thousand five hundred

288
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,500
It's still better than nothing!

289
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,060
Exactly!

290
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,680
It's still better than being a professional player!

291
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,400
Sorry, that's a low blow.

292
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,500
That's a low blow!

293
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,460
It's still better!

294
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,720
I still earn more than a regular professional player!

295
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,080
So...

296
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,320
So that's all that matters!

297
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,240
That's all that matters!

298
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,660
Oh my god.

299
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,880
Anyway...

300
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,700
Yeah, people are very... I was like... when I... okay...

301
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,560
I remember I saw the teams and I was like, oh shit, this is like...

302
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,820
Some of these teams are very, very, like... like... really good.

303
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,680
And then, I was like, maybe the minigames are like actual minigames, you know?

304
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,060
Like, no punches, or like no weapons.

305
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,580
Punch-outs, stuff like that.

306
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,240
And I was like, wait, you actually have to play the game?

307
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,520
And I was just like...

308
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,600
I was like, what do you mean?

309
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,040
What... why do some teams have two Preds?

310
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,780
I'm not Pred... guys, guys, I'm washed.

311
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,260
I mean like, two current Preds!

312
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,580
Sorry, let me be more specific.

313
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,880
Two current Preds!

314
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,440
I was like, what the fuck?

315
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,300
The last time I streamed Apex was last week!

316
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,460
Anyway, oh, let me know!

317
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,120
Thank you for the 50 gifted ships!

318
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,180
Thank you, thank you!

319
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,580
Alright, anyway, so I'm just like, folk, they were like, let's try and win!

320
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,120
And I was like, win?

321
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Alright, let's just spray this on this new Skyhooker Shrouds, because of my winning streak.

322
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,520
Okay.

323
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,100
Yay, we're starting!

324
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,820
Alright, I got this.

325
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,520
I got Watson picked out.

326
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,920
Wait, where is she?

327
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,220
We all just...

328
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,900
get a bunch of shield cells together, we can make a heart instantly.

329
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,080
How big does that heart need to be?

330
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,720
I don't think it has to be that big, I think it just needs to be a heart.

331
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
I think we just...

332
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,260
Arguably a heart.

333
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,580
I think just one person can just make the heart, and then we're good to go.

334
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,840
I've never made a shield cell heart, have you?

335
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,960
Oh, I can do it!

336
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,740
I can do it.

337
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,820
Good ship and beacon?

338
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,420
Wait...

339
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,440
Wait, we got beacon?

340
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,420
Fuck yeah.

341
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,080
Wait, I land in the middle, right?

342
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,300
Yeah, I can land on the front side.

343
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,900
Alright.

344
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,180
We're gonna be doing the no loot challenge.

345
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,620
We just gotta get the zone and lobo loot.

346
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,220
What's the no loot challenge?

347
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,480
We just don't get loot because we're landing straight.

348
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,140
That's fine, we have lobo, we can just pick the loot up.

349
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,480
Literally, I just pulled up the...

350
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,480
Oh, like the actual challenge?

351
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,720
And I was like, wait, what?

352
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,180
I don't remember how the loot pack was, but I know I was in the middle.

353
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,400
You just loot all of mid and then you can hit beacon whenever.

354
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,020
Yay, okay.

355
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,780
Actually, you can land on the beacon and hit it.

356
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,380
Can you still double hit beacons?

357
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,080
I forgot about that.

358
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,220
Oh my god, okay, hang on.

359
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,020
FOV.

360
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,460
FOV.

361
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,880
Oh yeah, FOV 90, no attachments.

362
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,060
Remember, zero attachments.

363
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,480
Okay.

364
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,660
Ooh, we gotta run double heavy.

365
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,320
It's actually not that bad.

366
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,420
Yeah, it's just bad on stream.

367
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,640
It just looks terrible.

368
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,320
I need a P20.

369
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,080
No P20s on my side.

370
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,160
Where is the zone out yet?

371
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,100
I have a blue bag, give me nades.

372
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,760
Alright.

373
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,100
I have a blue bag too.

374
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,700
Oh my god, I literally feel like I'm in a fishbowl.

375
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,720
If you're doing sniper, here it is.

376
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,180
I'm gonna scan.

377
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,900
We can go.

378
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,160
We should go, we should go.

379
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,100
Oh my god, skull piercer.

380
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,260
I'm gonna loot this build and then dip.

381
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,800
Alright, I only found two stacks of shield cells.

382
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,840
That's really neat.

383
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,880
I didn't get shit, to be honest.

384
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,700
I have a lot of names.

385
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,940
Do we get any evacs?

386
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,400
We have one evac.

387
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,120
Let's try to hit this balloon and pray we don't die hitting it.

388
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,020
I feel like, yeah, we shouldn't use any evacs yet.

389
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,060
We won't have to just use one to get in the zone.

390
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,260
No, how are you evacs?

391
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,660
I have my ult, should I drop it?

392
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,160
Nah, nah, nah, I won't use it.

393
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,540
I mean, just drop it now, cause you recharged it fast.

394
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,140
We just need to use it three times, right?

395
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,540
Yeah.

396
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, just drop it now, do it.

397
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,880
Okay, I'll go.

398
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,340
Yeah, and we'll just look at it for like one second.

399
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,220
I'm gonna loot an ulti.

400
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,460
I'm gonna grab a shield cell.

401
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,580
Oh, beautiful.

402
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,340
How badly I want this.

403
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
And I'll get the arch-stars too.

404
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,240
I have two, four, I have five nades already.

405
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,820
How many do you guys have?

406
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,200
Fly!

407
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,440
My, almost my whole bottom row is nades.

408
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh, wait, we can combine our nades.

409
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,000
Land on this roof.

410
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,400
Actually, I can't.

411
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,960
Wait, isn't there people there?

412
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,480
Not yet.

413
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,440
They're on me.

414
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,800
Go back, go back, go back over here.

415
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,740
Run back over here.

416
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,040
I'm gonna Q.

417
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,600
Just go.

418
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,800
Oh, I might be dead.

419
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,960
We can craft if we die.

420
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,780
Alright, we're fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

421
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,440
Come inside, run inside.

422
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,620
Run deep to the tunnel.

423
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,320
Alright.

424
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,460
They're aping us, hard aping us.

425
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,720
This guy's on Revenant.

426
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,970
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

427
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,650
Which way, left or right?

428
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:14,870
Oh, right.

429
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,570
You might have to hold them here.

430
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,330
They're literally here.

431
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,190
They're here.

432
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,050
Oh, yeah, I'm dead.

433
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,970
I didn't know it was left or right.

434
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:22,950
Cracked off.

435
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,630
You're pushing, hard pushing.

436
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,770
Hard aping, hard aping.

437
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,370
I'm not gonna lie.

438
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,310
Just run, Sylas.

439
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,230
Run!

440
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,330
I did not hear them climb up there.

441
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,530
If you're gonna die, name yourself.

442
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,350
If you're gonna die, at least kill yourself with names.

443
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,050
Oh, wait, yeah, I'm actually gonna kill myself with names.

444
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,070
Kill yourself with names or you're gonna die.

445
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,830
Okay, I mean, we technically did accomplish some of these challenges.

446
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,450
Bro, this Revenant character is OP.

447
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,950
I needed myself, I needed myself, I needed myself.

448
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,970
We got that!

449
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,590
That's all you needed.

450
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,110
Amazing.

451
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,370
It's okay, we got like, okay, I don't think we won this game.

452
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,550
I don't think we got this game's challenge.

453
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,690
I had 90 FOV and I had, I didn't get a knock with the P20.

454
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,210
I just had the P20 for no reason, but I had no attachments.

455
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,110
Hey, that's two challenges right there.

456
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,250
Two points for me, yeah.

457
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,030
Yeah, that's two new points.

458
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,790
I should have like just ran to the right.

459
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,370
Shouldn't have walked back to you guys.

460
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,250
I was confused too.

461
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,730
I didn't know if we were going left or right.

462
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,530
I was just like...

463
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,110
I'm not gonna lie.

464
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,490
I heard the revenant ult and the jump and we were just dead.

465
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,150
No, we split up.

466
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,250
One of us could have lived.

467
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,910
I just didn't know which way to go.

468
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,730
It's okay, we got three challenges, even though I don't think those three challenges...

469
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,530
We were not last!

470
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,590
We got 19th place.

471
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,790
Why did somebody die before us?

472
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,470
Yeah, I don't know.

473
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,350
I guess like losers and they die before us.

474
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,110
Imagine dying first, Hop.

475
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,470
I know, right?

476
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,970
Can you be...

477
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,090
I'm not gonna lie.

478
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,210
It's okay.

479
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:53,710
It's not me.

480
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,990
We didn't die first.

481
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,410
Imagine dying first.

482
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,570
Wait, was there no sound?

483
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,350
What do you mean guys?

484
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,030
There were totally...

485
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,810
That was totally sound.

486
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,670
Okay, let me just harass tempo into posting game two.

487
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,970
On the game two list.

488
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,330
Oh yeah, after the game ends, have one player.

489
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:21,870
I mean...

490
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,550
We could technically post our stuff now.

491
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,450
Yeah, we could.

492
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,530
Please be accurate.

493
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,950
We will be going over the VODs, thanks.

494
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,230
Oh, they can't go after my VODs.

495
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,170
I have no replay.

496
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,890
I don't have permissions yet, so maybe they open it up at the end of the game.

497
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,510
That makes sense.

498
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,330
Poor Temple.

499
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,990
He can't look at my VOD.

500
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,810
He has to wait until my stream's over.

501
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,220
And turn down Senox.

502
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,780
Actually, I just coin flipped the game on them red setting, but they didn't have a beacon character.

503
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm just glad that I don't have to play a 90 FOV.

504
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,140
Well, what if they have 90 FOV again in the card?

505
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,280
Doubt it.

506
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,140
They might though.

507
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,640
They might.

508
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,020
I really do feel like...

509
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,660
I don't know.

510
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,700
They might get harder or they might change the guns that you have to get Nox with.

511
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,900
I'm pretty sure they'll change the comps and stuff too.

512
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,300
Yeah, I think the comp one will change every game and then the guns will change.

513
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:34,800
Yeah.

514
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,140
Uh-huh.

515
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,340
I'm pretty sure.

516
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:38,760
It's okay.

517
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,880
This was just warm up.

518
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,820
This was warm up here.

519
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,360
And we sort of landed on them, to be fair.

520
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,980
Oh yeah, I know.

521
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,380
I was actually just assuming they'd be gone because they're landing next to Enzo, but they just weren't playing a beacon character.

522
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,050
I know.

523
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,850
That was pretty unlucky.

524
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,330
It's okay.

525
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,330
If this team wins, then we technically won.

526
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,270
We would've won the game.

527
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,290
Yeah, technically we won the game because we got killed by the winners.

528
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,810
So, we would have lived regardless.

529
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,530
I'm gonna message Tempo and be like, let me see game two.

530
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:28,450
Let me see the game two list so we can Metacraft.

531
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,110
Yeah.

532
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,990
Let's see.

533
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,300
Tempo, show me game two.

534
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,300
Not that.

535
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,380
Aw, Doki, I think I have some people from your community following you on Twitter.

536
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,160
Huh.

537
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,580
Huh.

538
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,020
Oh, that's nice.

539
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,240
Wait!

540
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,400
Tempo's making the card in between games?

541
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,680
He's done it!

542
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,580
He doesn't even... Oh, that's gonna take...

543
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,380
No one's in game two!

544
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,220
Okay, we should give him ideas.

545
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,240
We should give him ideas.

546
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,820
He was like, I don't even know.

547
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
I'm literally making the card right now.

548
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,600
Okay.

549
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,800
One of the challenges could be have a fat ass.

550
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,280
So, check.

551
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,820
I got y'all covered.

552
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,620
Which that means just play Loba.

553
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,180
Just play Loba.

554
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,600
Okay, chat, we can like influence Tempo.

555
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,260
He'll do what I'll say.

556
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,920
Like in pieces.

557
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,460
Um...

558
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,960
I mean, honestly, some fuse action could be funny.

559
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,600
Oh, okay.

560
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,060
Okay.

561
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:48,540
One of the cards should be... One of the challenges should be play fuse.

562
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,540
Oh, knockout with punch!

563
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,060
Yes!

564
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,140
Yes.

565
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,340
Punch him out.

566
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,580
Um...

567
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,780
I've got ten million things open and going out.

568
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,740
Bro, Tempo has seven monitors?

569
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,800
Holy sh... Wait.

570
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,160
Can I show this on stream?

571
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,860
Mana's not...

572
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,800
Oh my god!

573
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,180
Oh wait, this team's dying.

574
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,260
Oh, they're kind of living though.

575
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,180
This Revenant is cooking.

576
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,360
Like, who is this?

577
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,500
Who is this?

578
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:22,980
That's dropped.

579
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,480
Oh my god, Tempo has fucking seven mon... He has a laptop open...

580
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,780
To a finisher on them Rev.

581
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,520
On the side.

582
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,100
Look, the drop is a serious person.

583
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,800
The monitor is kind of crazy.

584
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,520
I'm not gonna lie.

585
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,700
Yes!

586
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,400
It's sick!

587
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,120
Oh my god!

588
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,760
He has a second computer monitor on the side.

589
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,160
Like a second computer.

590
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,380
I'm sorry, Tempo.

591
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,780
If you're watching this and you didn't want me to leak that...

592
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,940
Oh, he can let me... He said I can show it!

593
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,740
Guys, look at his fucking setup.

594
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,640
It's actually crazy.

595
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,660
Oh my god!

596
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,620
How...

597
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,760
That's like too... That's like sensor overload for me.

598
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,740
Jesus Christ.

599
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
Look at this, guys.

600
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,560
Oh... It's... Oh...

601
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,420
Look at this, seven fucking monitors.

602
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,600
xQc was right.

603
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,060
How do you...

604
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,440
That is like... Like, three monitors is already too much for me.

605
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,640
Seven mon... Two m... Two mouse, two keyboards.

606
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:47,440
Actually, three mouse, four keyboards, seven mon... Seven monitors, one PC, a camera, a mic.

607
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,900
My god.

608
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,060
My god.

609
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,020
He had to like check... He had to like check to make sure there was nothing confidential.

610
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,660
My god.

611
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,300
He needs to go further beyond.

612
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,060
Five cats.

613
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,320
Six consoles.

614
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,200
Oh my god.

615
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,600
This is... This is like... He organized this tournament, but...

616
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,280
By the way, guys.

617
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,980
Like, you need to have at least seven monitors to be able to organize this tournament.

618
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,040
That's actually crazy.

619
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,760
That's a lot of PC.

620
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,300
Zero wall... It's okay, guys.

621
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,960
I can like peer pressure him to buy Doki merch.

622
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,720
And then he can put...

623
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,500
Little acrobat.

624
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,120
He's thinking with the super chat.

625
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,560
Thank you, thank you.

626
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,620
By the way, I muted myself.

627
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,520
I feel like... I don't want to like...

628
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,640
Bother them with the shit I say.

629
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,980
I can peer pressure him to buy Doki merch and put that...

630
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,820
Wait, let me message that.

631
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,400
If... If I send... Okay, if you... You should buy my merch...

632
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,620
To decorate your wall.

633
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,200
It's so... It's so empty.

634
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,920
And then, he...

635
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,140
And then, it's like... it's like free... Okay, it's not free advertising because like he's...

636
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,540
He has to pay for my merch.

637
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,380
But it's like, it's... Oh, it is free advertising for me!

638
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,020
Because he's the one that spent money.

639
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,600
So it's technically free advertising for me.

640
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Okay... I should like, let you guys actually watch the game.

641
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,500
Not look at, not look at Tempo's face.

642
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,200
I'm so happy that I got this fucking setup.

643
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,880
All these monitors and zero doki merch.

644
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,660
It's a free win-win!

645
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,740
Exactly!

646
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,440
Exactly.

647
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,840
So anytime...

648
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,960
Anytime someone comes in, he's like TSM's manager.

649
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,900
So like, I might be able to get TSM fans to buy my merch!

650
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,980
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but I'm playing the game This Is Me right now.

651
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,080
This Is Me right now.

652
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,840
No, don't die!

653
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,820
You have to win!

654
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,080
So it technically means we died to the champion!

655
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,320
You guys can't die!

656
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,120
You guys as in me.

657
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
I can't die.

658
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,200
God, I'm so good at this game.

659
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
Holy shit.

660
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,040
Seven kills already.

661
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,860
Holy shit.

662
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Seven kills already.

663
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,820
Number one revved me.

664
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,240
You can call me number one Pred.

665
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,300
No!

666
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,160
Dropped!

667
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,020
I mean doki!

668
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,320
Don't die!

669
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,060
You have to live!

670
00:27:59,460 --> 00:27:59,700
No!

671
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,860
I died!

672
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,960
It's okay.

673
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,120
It's just...

674
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,480
Guys, just so you guys know.

675
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,960
That was not me.

676
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,560
I would never play like that.

677
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,840
Played.

678
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,440
I would never play like that.

679
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,620
It's okay.

680
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,540
This is actually me.

681
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,760
It was a little spectator bug that happened.

682
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,340
So I am...

683
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,500
Wait, who is on my team?

684
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,060
Who is on my team?

685
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,640
Okay.

686
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,620
That is...

687
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,340
I'm DZ.

688
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,600
DZ0 is like...

689
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,760
Doki...

690
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,780
Doki's...

691
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,560
Bird 0.

692
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,460
Doki's 0 bird.

693
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,840
Wait, what is he playing right now?

694
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,900
Is he on Bangalore?

695
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,220
No, he's on...

696
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,360
Is he on Bangalore?

697
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,460
Okay, am I on Bangalore?

698
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm on Bangalore.

699
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,820
Doki's...

700
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
Doki's 0 bird.

701
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,980
There we go.

702
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,380
I always knew... I know!

703
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,100
The thing is, Doki is universal.

704
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,040
I can be from any country.

705
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,740
So like, today I'm in Australia.

706
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,660
Today I'm on Australia.

707
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,420
I can do whatever I want.

708
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,480
It will be funny if we actually did influence Tempos game 2 bingo.

709
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,600
Or not bingo.

710
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,180
What is it called?

711
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,060
Uh...

712
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,780
Like, challenge sheet.

713
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,840
It feels like...

714
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,900
You made this.

715
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,240
I made this.

716
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,420
You are 0?

717
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,660
I'm 0.

718
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,640
Australian Doki.

719
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,760
I mean, I'm technically like...

720
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm like halfway there.

721
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,300
I swear a lot.

722
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,460
They say... I don't say that.

723
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:01,220
That is sadly not in my... Is it sadly not in... That is not in my natural vocabulary.

724
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,400
You hesitated.

725
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,360
Oh, what was I gonna say?

726
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,980
You'll never know.

727
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,320
You'll never... They say what?

728
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,160
I don't know.

729
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,620
What would they be saying?

730
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,280
So, do we keep our POI?

731
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,560
Oh, no.

732
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:20,980
It changes.

733
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,420
Wait, it changes?

734
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,420
Aw, okay.

735
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:23,680
Thankfully.

736
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,140
Oh, I mean, I'm... I didn't like tree anyway.

737
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,800
I didn't like tree anyway.

738
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,580
Drop the bomb, mate.

739
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,880
You can't say I have the pass!

740
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,140
I'm only...

741
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,020
I only have Australian!

742
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,420
You can say can't.

743
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,980
Yeah.

744
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,980
I can't say that word.

745
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:03,240
What?

746
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,280
I can't do that!

747
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,660
What do you mean?

748
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,140
I can't understand what you're talking about.

749
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,980
Oh, my God.

750
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,300
Yeah, half a pass.

751
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,280
Half the word.

752
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,200
Oh, my God.

753
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,800
Who's gonna win?

754
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:39,840
I like how nobody's doing the... the... We should have done the Valkyrie thing.

755
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,540
We could have got one more.

756
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,360
Whoa!

757
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,020
I died.

758
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,160
Doki zero bird!

759
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,340
How could you?

760
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,880
You're supposed to be the champion!

761
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,360
How could you do this?

762
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,180
All right, who's in this team?

763
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,580
Oh, my God.

764
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,100
Okay, wait.

765
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,720
Who's... Okay.

766
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,260
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

767
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:03,960
Is that Sykes?

768
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,920
Okay, they're on the same team.

769
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,280
It's technically the same thing.

770
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,380
It's now Doki... Doki's Sykes bird.

771
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,840
They're on the same team.

772
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,780
It's the same thing.

773
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,360
I'm on the same team.

774
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,600
It's the same thing.

775
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,140
13 kills.

776
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,700
Because he's a pro player!

777
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,780
He's a controller player!

778
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,620
The only thing we were missing was a controller player.

779
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,380
Okay?

780
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,220
What do you want us to do?

781
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,800
We're all in MM... Wait, is it Sunox controller or MMK?

782
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,020
Let me look at the input real fast.

783
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,340
I just don't remember.

784
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,160
Okay.

785
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,000
They're also MMK!

786
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,520
Look!

787
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,860
I'm sorry!

788
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,020
We were nerfed so hard!

789
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:54,780
Okay?

790
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,700
We were... We were nerfed so hard!

791
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,320
We're all full MMK players!

792
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,860
What were we supposed to do?

793
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,380
What were we supposed to do?

794
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,640
We were all MMK!

795
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,640
Movement can't save us!

796
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,440
Oh, why is that... Oh, that's like the Pathfinder thingy, right?

797
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,020
Oh my god, where are they?

798
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,320
That poor Gibraltar is just floating in the...

799
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,600
That poor Caustic that was in the middle of nowhere.

800
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,100
What the fuck?

801
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,380
I'm the content creator!

802
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,620
What do you mean?

803
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,800
Each team has three people.

804
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,080
An Apex streamer.

805
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,440
A pro player.

806
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,360
And the content creator.

807
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,660
I am the content creator!

808
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,380
You cannot put all the expectations on me!

809
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,060
We should be putting all the expectations on the pro player.

810
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,360
If we are blaming anybody, it's definitely not me!

811
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,180
Look, I am the content creator.

812
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,900
I want to have Tempo finish this fucking bingo card.

813
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,680
No, I'm gonna blame you.

814
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,640
I'm not two things!

815
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,880
No, no, no, no, no, no!

816
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,300
I put myself in the content creator role!

817
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,580
I put myself in the content creator.

818
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,340
There's no coping here.

819
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,360
There's no coping here.

820
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,960
There's no coping here.

821
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,400
Alright, let's see.

822
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,320
Did he finish the list?

823
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,340
I don't think he did.

824
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,380
I'd be so surprised.

825
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,180
How many challenges did we complete?

826
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,520
Uh...

827
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,140
I mean...

828
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,040
I'm pretty sure it has...

829
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,060
Was it just three?

830
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,380
I don't think we did, no.

831
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:52,620
Not a lot.

832
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,460
We died instantly.

833
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,700
We died instantly.

834
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,480
Yeah, but we did so many things, though.

835
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,880
No, we really didn't, though.

836
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,500
We didn't have chance.

837
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,780
Um, I had...

838
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,040
We had half a V, then no attachments, and then the nade, right?

839
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,420
That's it.

840
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,520
Was it really that?

841
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,500
What was the nade?

842
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,300
Okay, yeah, it was three.

843
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,820
Okay, three.

844
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,700
It's okay.

845
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,540
The other people did three as well.

846
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,420
We're not last in the challenges either.

847
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,640
Who the fuck did A?

848
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,500
That's insane.

849
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Oh my god.

850
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,600
Zero got ten.

851
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,260
They got zero?

852
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,340
Wait, they got zero!

853
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,580
At least we didn't get zero.

854
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:29,860
Not last!

855
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,420
We're not zero!

856
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,820
They might be the team that died last, too.

857
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,080
Or died first.

858
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,000
If they got zero, that is actually unfortunate.

859
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,780
Guys, I just need you guys to know, chat.

860
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,220
Three is the average.

861
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,940
There's like six other people with three.

862
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,980
We're not alone.

863
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,320
Guys, we got the average!

864
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
We got it!

865
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,900
I have to like really think about this.

866
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,040
And honestly, like...

867
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,740
We...

868
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:11,060
If we would have maybe played slower, we maybe would have had more time to finish some of these like little easy ones.

869
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,520
I don't know.

870
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,880
Yeah, we could have got their little heart.

871
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,340
Our little heart and then we could have been a four.

872
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,040
Yeah, like even before we left the POI, like we could have did the fucking...

873
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,000
We could just not play hard zone then.

874
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
Because if we're playing hard zone, we have to go center zone.

875
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,760
But if we die early, we just get zeroed in.

876
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:32,660
Let's just... yeah, let's just do all the easy stuff in our POI and then move on.

877
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,820
I'm done.

878
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,380
I wonder what Tempo figured out in between games.

879
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,340
Yeah, I hope he actually changes the challenges.

880
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,320
Oh no, he is.

881
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,900
He's like doing them in between games.

882
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,080
Alright, we just do all the ones we can do instantly without having to do any work.

883
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,420
And then we just get the other ones out.

884
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,420
And we just... if we do good in the game, do the other ones.

885
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:52,880
I'm done.

886
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,900
Yeah, yeah, just get the easy ones out.

887
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,620
Alright, we just have like...

888
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,900
Like some of the challenges done then zero.

889
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,060
Like that poor man over there.

890
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,860
Chat, do not worry.

891
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,800
I will not call out the person that got zero.

892
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,320
You might be able to find out on girls stream yourself.

893
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,300
If you really want to know.

894
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,480
You won't find out on my stream.

895
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,080
I am muted.

896
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,560
I am muted.

897
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,200
Thank you for the 50 gifted chips bacon.

898
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Thank you, thank you.

899
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,040
What?

900
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm not gonna call anybody out.

901
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,040
Wait, so is it whoever completes the most challenges over all six games?

902
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,200
Or is it just whoever completes it for that game?

903
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,860
For that game.

904
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Okay, so...

905
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,020
But the team that completes the most challenges overall goes to the finals.

906
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,500
You get the money...

907
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,540
How many teams get to go to the finals?

908
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,340
Two teams.

909
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:04,620
Two teams that completes the most challenges overall gets to go to the finals.

910
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,620
But like you get to win a thousand five hundred.

911
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,660
For the most challenges completed per game.

912
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,000
You get to win a thousand five hundred for winning first place.

913
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,840
Or a thousand five hundred for completing the most challenges.

914
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,630
Oh okay, I'm looking at it right now.

915
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,810
Six teams make finals off of challenges.

916
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,270
One per game and then...

917
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,390
Two individual players with most kills.

918
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

919
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,720
So it's either...

920
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,100
So like finals is just dependent on challenges.

921
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,520
Oh yeah, we actually just need to spam challenges.

922
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:44,660
Yeah.

923
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,440
One game and just get infinite.

924
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,040
We just do the bare minimum ones we can do.

925
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,180
And then if we have a good game we just crank it out like ten.

926
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,480
Yeah, exactly.

927
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,280
Do we do the same comp?

928
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,260
Or do we...

929
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,420
Should we play the comp that...

930
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,460
I don't know.

931
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,860
I want to see what the challenges are.

932
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,880
I want to see what he changes.

933
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,800
Because if we're not playing...

934
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,740
If we're not rotating then we shouldn't put that comp.

935
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:05,920
What?

936
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,480
Finals?

937
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:06,860
Okay.

938
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,940
I'll tell you guys...

939
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,280
I just have to play the comp that has a challenge for playing the actual comp.

940
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,100
Because it's just a free challenge.

941
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:12,800
Basically.

942
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:13,760
Basically.

943
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,260
It is basically like whichever...

944
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,780
There's three tournaments.

945
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,420
There's four tournaments.

946
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,500
But I can't count.

947
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,880
So there's three tournaments that are like the qualifying tournaments.

948
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,760
I should sign up for next week too.

949
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,980
I like didn't sign up for next week.

950
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,560
But if I'd be like, Temple, can I join next week?

951
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,880
Maybe he'll be like, Okay.

952
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,240
Anyway.

953
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,080
Anyway.

954
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,600
At least sign up for like two.

955
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,100
But you can sign up for three.

956
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:39,840
Anyway.

957
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,580
So there's three tournaments.

958
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:42,980
And...

959
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,280
And they're each like invitational.

960
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,980
And so basically...

961
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:57,980
The team that wins the most challenges in each tournament goes towards the finals.

962
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,220
And the finals...

963
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,000
So like the finals will be composed of all the teams that are like the best of each individual tournament.

964
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,680
Each individual tournament is different.

965
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,560
The second one...

966
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,960
The reason why I didn't sign up for the second one was because the second one was actually more reliant on like...

967
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,080
FPS skills.

968
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,940
But I didn't realize this tournament...

969
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,780
I thought the mini games...

970
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,180
What I mean...

971
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,320
In mini games is like hide and seek and stuff like that.

972
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,060
You're not actually like playing...

973
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,340
Everyone's asking for the challenge.

974
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,920
Trying hard and stuff like that.

975
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,860
But now I realize...

976
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,600
Oh shit.

977
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,940
This is actually low key try hard.

978
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,820
So I might as well sign up for the second one as well.

979
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,500
Maybe ahead of time.

980
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,020
Sorry.

981
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,100
I have to listen to what they're saying.

982
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,380
Anyway.

983
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,280
I didn't realize.

984
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:38,780
Okay.

985
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,400
So now...

986
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,480
Now I'm like, Oh shit.

987
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,480
I might as well sign up for the second one.

988
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,940
Maybe.

989
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,180
Cause the first one is basically like the second one and I already got that out of the way.

990
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,500
So I might as well sign up for the second one also cause the second one is also like...

991
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,460
Like shooting your gun.

992
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,400
So...

993
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,960
I thought...

994
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,680
You know...

995
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,580
I thought there would be like punching, boxing, stuff like that.

996
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,700
Cause it says mini games.

997
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,240
But I didn't realize that what they meant was a bingo charge.

998
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,100
Haha.

999
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,160
Haha.

1000
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,640
Haha.

1001
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,600
Anyway...

1002
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,420
Anyway, as I was saying...

1003
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,040
So, it's basically whichever team completes the most challenges...

1004
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,920
and also whichever two individuals do the most kills, they get straight to the finals.

1005
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,620
And then the finals is composed of all the teams that did really well in the invitationals.

1006
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,380
And then, boom...

1007
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,660
A thousand... easy $500 that I make it to the finals.

1008
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,340
Yeah, there is a lot of... really...

1009
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,360
Two teams got 10 challenges completed and they tied for first.

1010
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,360
Oh my gosh.

1011
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,260
By the way, it's actually...

1012
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,240
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1013
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,820
Who placed...

1014
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,560
It's actually crazy though.

1015
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,480
I'd be surprised if I get into the other two tournaments...

1016
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,300
because apparently a lot of people signed up for these.

1017
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,000
Like, a lot of people.

1018
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,840
Obviously, I can't give out the numbers, but like...

1019
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,400
They...

1020
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,040
When I... they're like...

1021
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,000
I had... they're like...

1022
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,700
They're like, I have to check blank amount of applicants.

1023
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,140
I was like, holy fuck!

1024
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,340
And I just sent... I sent like...

1025
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,860
a Doki Amber Doge emoji of him sleeping.

1026
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,780
And I was like, good luck.

1027
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,260
A lot... it was a lot of people.

1028
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,120
I was just like...

1029
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,320
I'm... man... that...

1030
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,720
That's a lot of people you have to check, bro.

1031
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,500
Holy fuck.

1032
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,600
Um...

1033
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,360
Can we see that emoji?

1034
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,960
Okay, let me snip that emoji.

1035
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,640
This is like the emoji I sent back.

1036
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,300
I can like show it on stream now.

1037
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,940
I...

1038
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,300
Like, they're like being like, man, I have to check a lot of people.

1039
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,420
And I... and they gave me the number and I was like, bro.

1040
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,920
And then I sent back...

1041
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,560
Oh, wait.

1042
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:13,940
Whoops.

1043
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,740
That's not it.

1044
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
That is not it.

1045
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,260
I need to like lock in this...

1046
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,900
Fugi, so I don't accidentally...

1047
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,140
I don't accidentally move the Fugi.

1048
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,720
Okay, I need to like reset the...

1049
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,380
Okay, I sent this picture back to them.

1050
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,480
This is one of my favorite emojis.

1051
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I have like...

1052
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,860
Okay, I use a lot of emojis.

1053
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,340
That's just pictures of my dog.

1054
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,840
Because...

1055
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,920
Because my dog is like... is so good at giving you emotions.

1056
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,120
Wait, let me... I'll show you the other ones.

1057
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,580
Wait, I need to like send myself these emojis.

1058
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,080
Okay, I have...

1059
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,840
I have this one that is like...

1060
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,380
That is me yelling at people when I'm like...

1061
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,520
I have this one too.

1062
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,200
And then I also have...

1063
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,400
I also have this one.

1064
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,460
Wait, I'll just...

1065
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:28,860
Shoot.

1066
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,020
I also...

1067
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,620
I also have...

1068
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,680
I also have this one.

1069
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:40,940
I'm sorry.

1070
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,360
My dog is just so good at giving me emotions.

1071
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,140
It's showing emotion.

1072
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,180
What can I say?

1073
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,140
What can I say?

1074
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,700
It's just so good.

1075
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,200
So like... I... I like...

1076
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,860
The majority of time, whenever people talk to me and I use like emojis...

1077
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,980
It's just... all of it is just close up of my dog's face.

1078
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,380
Because it's just so good.

1079
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,900
It's like...

1080
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,660
It's just point... Exactly!

1081
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,040
It's like a point to be a meme.

1082
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,940
Who's in my team?

1083
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,120
It's Senox and...

1084
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,020
And... Heenie.

1085
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,420
Oh shit.

1086
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,540
Wait, we can give clips?

1087
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:21,920
Guys!

1088
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,120
Fuck!

1089
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,620
This sucks because I have no replay...

1090
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,820
I'm not on Twitch!

1091
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,300
We can't fucking show clips!

1092
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,040
Someone!

1093
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,360
Any YouTube editor right now.

1094
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,600
Any YouTube clipper.

1095
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,980
If you have any.

1096
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,160
For those who have been recording this stream.

1097
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,280
If you have funny videos of this stream.

1098
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:43,920
If you have funny videos of this stream.

1099
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,360
Upload it now and I can put it in the...

1100
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:47,900
Because...

1101
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,840
Because...

1102
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,260
You can also win money for having...

1103
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,820
Um...

1104
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,740
For having 1000...

1105
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,400
You can win 1000 dollars each person.

1106
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,560
For the two best clips.

1107
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:01,480
Clippers!

1108
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,440
I know we don't have clips.

1109
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,720
But...

1110
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,600
If you have a good clip from my stream.

1111
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,020
Please upload it on YouTube.

1112
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,620
And like...

1113
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,240
I don't know.

1114
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,360
Actually I don't.

1115
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:15,880
Please!

1116
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,060
Figure out some way...

1117
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,360
To send this clip to me.

1118
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,740
Oh!

1119
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,400
Use the hashtag!

1120
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,800
I have a clip hashtag!

1121
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,500
Use my clips hashtag!

1122
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,480
Guys!

1123
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,060
We can win 1000 dollars...

1124
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,220
So easily.

1125
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,160
Use my hashtag!

1126
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:39,960
DokiClips!

1127
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,020
For all...

1128
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,580
Any of the Apex clips we've made today!

1129
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,200
And then...

1130
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,260
And then we can...

1131
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,140
We can win...

1132
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,300
Win the vote.

1133
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,500
We can win the vote by sheer...

1134
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,340
Okay.

1135
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,900
We're not gonna cheat guys.

1136
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,100
We're not gonna...

1137
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,380
We're not gonna...

1138
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,880
It has to be actually funny guys.

1139
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,100
So like...

1140
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,480
We're gonna keep...

1141
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,680
Going to do... Keep the same card for World's Edge.

1142
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,000
And then a new card for Stormpoint.

1143
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,940
So the challenges are the same.

1144
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:12,100
Oh!

1145
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,960
Oh the challenges are the same.

1146
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,860
Does he mean like the ones we've completed are like...

1147
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,240
We don't have to complete?

1148
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,500
Like we're keeping the same ones?

1149
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,820
Or are we genuinely just on the same card?

1150
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,180
I think that's what everyone is asking.

1151
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,000
I think like... Yeah I think everyone is asking that right now.

1152
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,780
I think...

1153
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,140
I think he meant like...

1154
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,900
I guess like the challenges are the same but they reset?

1155
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:33,860
Maybe?

1156
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,540
Someone is asking if they carry over.

1157
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,120
That's...

1158
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,180
I mean it would make sense to carry over.

1159
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,280
Because...

1160
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,820
Like why...

1161
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,400
Have to play 90 FOV every fucking game?

1162
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,040
Please no.

1163
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,340
Please.

1164
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,840
I feel like it shouldn't though.

1165
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,620
Like to be...

1166
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,160
To make it fair for everybody.

1167
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,840
Because like each...

1168
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,860
Like you win 1500 for having the most challenges.

1169
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,380
And like the person...

1170
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,720
The team with the most challenges are ready.

1171
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,980
In the first game.

1172
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,420
Yeah they are already ahead.

1173
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,460
They should reset.

1174
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,820
Yeah you are right.

1175
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,160
It should because it would be so easy for them to finish the other challenges.

1176
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,980
I don't even think he has answered anybody yet.

1177
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:17,820
I don't think anyone has.

1178
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,720
I think he is thinking.

1179
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,780
He is like wait this is a bad idea.

1180
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,600
Because he was making the card.

1181
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,740
I was talking to him.

1182
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,860
He was trying to make the card.

1183
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,640
I was just not prepared.

1184
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,820
I think like halfway...

1185
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,520
He didn't think the game was going to end that fast.

1186
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,840
While he was making the card.

1187
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:42,930
Also...

1188
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:44,530
Also...

1189
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,290
Thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

1190
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:46,930
Thank you.

1191
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:47,550
Thank you.

1192
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,550
I really appreciate it.

1193
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,350
Thank you so much.

1194
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,810
Also we don't have emotes yet.

1195
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,110
Because I was thinking...

1196
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,110
I felt like...

1197
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:59,590
I wanted to wait until my new skin suit was finished.

1198
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,170
Before we have...

1199
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,090
Before we upload new emotes.

1200
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:04,990
I meant to upload...

1201
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,810
People to my dock.

1202
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,690
Because I don't want to...

1203
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:14,770
I don't wanna like, I don't wanna like waste money and like have it remain.

1204
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,050
Okay, but yes.

1205
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,950
Oh, we just, do we just play Valkyrie Caustic then?

1206
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,730
If it's staying the same?

1207
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:23,210
No matter what?

1208
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,430
Yeah, we might as well so we can get that.

1209
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:26,990
Yeah, we might as well.

1210
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:28,290
Guys.

1211
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,930
I can play anyone but Valk to be honest.

1212
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:35,250
Yeah, I cannot do Valk so I guess Senox is just automatically on Valk.

1213
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:37,330
I'll take Gibby.

1214
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:38,510
I can do Caustic.

1215
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:39,730
Beautiful.

1216
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,470
Okay, anyway.

1217
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,290
Okay, if you guys have the clips.

1218
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,690
Give me the links to it.

1219
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,190
Give me the links to the clips.

1220
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,650
If it's the same card we need to beat that one anyways.

1221
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:51,770
On Dokie Clips.

1222
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,430
Wait, what's my hashtag again?

1223
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,870
Dokie Clips and then I'll post those clips into the Clip Channel.

1224
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:58,010
Guys.

1225
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,870
Guys, come on.

1226
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,310
If I win a thousand dollars, we all win.

1227
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:08,630
Guys.

1228
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,290
We all win this together.

1229
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,550
They are blowing this man up.

1230
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:15,650
This is so true!

1231
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,370
It's a team effort!

1232
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,550
It's a team effort!

1233
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,090
You win spiritually.

1234
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,070
Guys, it's like we both felt the win together.

1235
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,030
Um.

1236
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:31,090
Oh yes!

1237
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:31,330
Yes!

1238
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:37,270
Also, might as well give the update because they're still trying to figure out the whole fucking team scenario at the moment.

1239
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:38,750
But basically...

1240
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:47,830
Basically, tomorrow it's not gonna be Resident Evil 4.

1241
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:53,650
We're swapping Resident Evil 4 with the Who-phobia stream.

1242
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,870
Do the scheduling.

1243
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:00,950
Because I got Sayu and Amelie got Fruit.

1244
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:07,130
So the schedule works better on Friday instead of Saturday.

1245
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,150
So on Friday, we're playing with Amelie, Sayu, and Fruit.

1246
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,610
And then Saturday, it's gonna be Resident Evil 4.

1247
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:20,570
We swapped it because it was the best scheduling-wise for...

1248
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,650
No, Sayu.

1249
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:25,310
C.

1250
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,070
C.

1251
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:26,670
Y.

1252
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:27,530
Y.

1253
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:28,270
Wait.

1254
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:28,570
C.

1255
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:28,910
Y.

1256
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:29,250
Y.

1257
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:29,570
U.

1258
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,650
The voice actor.

1259
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:36,610
Okay.

1260
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,190
Here, here.

1261
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,150
I'll type it down.

1262
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,790
The voice actor.

1263
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,170
I know.

1264
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,170
It got confusing.

1265
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:50,550
It got confusing.

1266
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,830
I'm gonna say it's Sayu.

1267
00:51:58,730 --> 00:51:59,370
Okay.

1268
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,110
So...

1269
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:07,650
So I got Sayu on my end and Amelie got Fruit.

1270
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:13,470
So to match everybody's schedule because there was like four of us, you know?

1271
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:21,630
And like Saturday, people would have... like Saturday, the schedule was conflicting for a lot of us.

1272
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,630
So we decided to swap.

1273
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:28,790
We decided to swap it for tomorrow instead of... instead of Saturday.

1274
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,650
So I just wanted to give you guys the update for that.

1275
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:33,450
Everybody's just debating.

1276
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:35,690
Guys.

1277
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:39,930
Okay.

1278
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,330
So people...

1279
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:52,670
There is a huge technical issue at the moment because people are debating right now about like whether or not to reset the cards.

1280
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,750
And everything.

1281
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:55,710
Oh, wait.

1282
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:58,430
Okay.

1283
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:00,810
Alright.

1284
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:03,850
So...

1285
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:05,270
Oh, wait.

1286
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:05,530
Okay.

1287
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:06,690
I'm looking at the update.

1288
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,190
I'm looking at the update right now.

1289
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,690
We have to make a change to a few challenges.

1290
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,410
We're completed as an...

1291
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,030
Wait, what?

1292
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,690
I don't even... I wasn't supposed to read that out loud.

1293
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,140
Sorry.

1294
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,620
Did I answer it?

1295
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:25,820
Whoops.

1296
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:27,800
Sorry.

1297
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,120
They're talking about it right now.

1298
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,240
They're still deciding.

1299
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,820
They're still... I'm sorry.

1300
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,440
I didn't mean to... I didn't leak anything.

1301
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,220
I didn't leak anything, guys.

1302
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,120
I didn't leak anything.

1303
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:47,220
They're having a discussion about whether or not the challenges stack or they are... or they would keep going.

1304
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,320
So one of the biggest issue right now is that there was 25 challenges.

1305
00:53:53,320 --> 00:54:00,320
But they didn't... they thought that we were gonna get 25 challenges or like close to 25 challenges.

1306
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,020
And... but we sort of...

1307
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,800
The closest was 10 challenges.

1308
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:20,200
So they're trying to decide right now if like we're gonna keep the same card and seeing... and like just whoever gets the most type deal.

1309
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,240
Because like no...

1310
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,280
The closest the team got was 10 challenges and not 25.

1311
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,880
Because like 25 was a lot.

1312
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,060
Okay.

1313
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,940
Let me... let me see if anybody got me the... some Doki clips that I can like spam.

1314
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,900
We can win by sheer numbers of clips.

1315
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,000
Chat.

1316
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:44,780
Chat.

1317
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,480
We have so many...

1318
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:46,980
Wait.

1319
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,340
No.

1320
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:47,720
No.

1321
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,260
We should not.

1322
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,220
Because I would divide the vote.

1323
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:49,640
Guys.

1324
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,520
Don't divide the vote, guys.

1325
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,380
Give me your best clips.

1326
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:03,940
I realized if we spend too many clips, then it'll divide the votes too fast.

1327
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,480
So we have to send... give me your best clips to like...

1328
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,420
We cannot divide the votes.

1329
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,520
Guys.

1330
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,080
If... if we... we have to win this together.

1331
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,160
What clips?

1332
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,360
Clips from this stream.

1333
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,080
I know there's no... there's no rewind.

1334
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,520
But I believe in you.

1335
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,100
I... I believe in you guys.

1336
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:29,700
Clip master.

1337
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,140
I need your strongest clips right now.

1338
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,860
Because... but...

1339
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,440
Guys.

1340
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,120
Guys.

1341
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,060
But think of it this way.

1342
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,280
If we... we can technically win...

1343
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,700
Because they're thinking.

1344
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,300
They're like...

1345
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:42,480
Oh.

1346
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,020
We might send it to like 500 per clip.

1347
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,740
If we win all four of them, we...

1348
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,280
Hahaha.

1349
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:55,200
If we have all the four of the best clips, guys.

1350
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,260
Hahaha.

1351
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,880
We... we can...

1352
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,600
Guys.

1353
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,560
Just think of it this way.

1354
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,540
Four of the best clips.

1355
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:07,660
Hahaha.

1356
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,840
We can win all of them.

1357
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,080
You can't handle... Guys.

1358
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,080
I believe in you.

1359
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,480
I believe in all of you.

1360
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:19,340
Hahaha.

1361
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,120
Someone's like, I feel so stupid right now trying to understand all of this.

1362
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,400
I'm just vibing.

1363
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,940
I'm just vibing.

1364
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,420
It's been one hour.

1365
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,320
We played one game.

1366
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,120
Hahaha.

1367
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,060
No.

1368
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,380
No.

1369
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,160
They're thinking of like dividing it by four.

1370
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,620
So like instead of a thousand each person.

1371
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,420
Um.

1372
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,320
It's 500 per person.

1373
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,460
So like if we just have too many good clips.

1374
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,340
We can technically get all of them.

1375
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,200
Hahaha.

1376
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,200
We can...

1377
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,820
How many games?

1378
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,640
It's... six.

1379
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,520
Hahaha.

1380
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,660
It's... it's... it's six guys.

1381
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,680
Hahaha.

1382
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,660
It's six.

1383
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,540
Don't worry.

1384
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,980
We can be here for six hours.

1385
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,460
We can do this.

1386
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,200
I... I believe in us.

1387
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,760
I believe in us.

1388
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,280
Okay.

1389
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,240
Do not reuse the ones...

1390
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:22,560
What?

1391
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,060
Do not redo... Oh!

1392
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:25,220
Oh!

1393
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,220
Oh!

1394
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:27,720
Okay.

1395
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,320
It stacks.

1396
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,840
It's gonna stack.

1397
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,900
It looks like it stacks.

1398
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,640
Cause it says do not reuse...

1399
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,280
Do the ones you've already completed.

1400
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,280
Focus on completing the whole card.

1401
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:39,940
Okay.

1402
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,440
Did it say that?

1403
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:40,900
Yeah.

1404
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,480
Someone just said it in chat.

1405
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,940
I think they were watching on stream.

1406
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,220
So... so it doesn't...

1407
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,260
That's... that's a bit unfair.

1408
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,020
Not gonna lie.

1409
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,200
Hahaha.

1410
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,360
Obviously.

1411
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:55,460
Alright.

1412
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,000
Same card for our world's edge.

1413
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,320
Oh!

1414
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:57,860
Oh!

1415
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,260
We wipe.

1416
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:58,780
Okay.

1417
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,220
We wipe.

1418
00:57:59,280 --> 00:57:59,540
Okay.

1419
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,360
What the fuck?

1420
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,420
Why... why is it different from the person above?

1421
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:03,680
Okay.

1422
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,540
So it's just fresh card.

1423
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,300
It's the same card but it wipes every game.

1424
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:06,560
Oh!

1425
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,820
So we just redo as many as we can.

1426
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,660
We wipe.

1427
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:09,520
Yay!

1428
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:09,680
Oh my gosh.

1429
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,180
We have to do...

1430
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,400
We have to do the person...

1431
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:12,660
We do it again!

1432
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:20,700
I like how someone there was like, so we start all over after they were like, do not redo the ones you already completed.

1433
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:21,500
Hahaha.

1434
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,980
Oh thank god.

1435
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:23,740
Okay.

1436
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,080
So we want to do as many as we can for free, right?

1437
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:26,760
Yeah.

1438
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:26,920
Yeah.

1439
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:34,300
90 FOV, 3 evil harvesters, uh, nades in a bag, 3 evacs or survival items, Yeah.

1440
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,400
Valkyrie caustic, um...

1441
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,380
I think we should...

1442
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,580
Um... knock yourself, draw a heart, no attachments, alt 3 times.

1443
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,320
That's about it.

1444
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,460
The other ones are altico people.

1445
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:43,660
Yeah.

1446
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,900
I feel like we could just do all that in our POI.

1447
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,840
We could do caustic alt.

1448
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,280
Yeah.

1449
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:46,920
We could do...

1450
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,060
Oh yeah.

1451
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,140
We could literally just lurk and do nothing and do nothing.

1452
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:49,340
But wait.

1453
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:49,480
Okay.

1454
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,240
We'll say, Valk, you probably have to do the nade one because we some big boys.

1455
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,300
Yeah.

1456
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,060
I just do it at the start of the game.

1457
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,180
Yeah.

1458
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,660
The nade one.

1459
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,000
Okay.

1460
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,080
We could do that right off the bat.

1461
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,780
And then like, we can have alt...

1462
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,900
We'll try and find as many altixels as possible and give it all to one person.

1463
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:02,820
Yeah.

1464
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,900
That sounds good.

1465
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,080
It's easy.

1466
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,280
We could legit just all run a different sniper and whoever gets a knock finishes the challenge.

1467
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:11,760
Wait.

1468
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,860
Who's doing the no survival items?

1469
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:13,680
Let's do it.

1470
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,360
Let's survive the game.

1471
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:14,700
Okay.

1472
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,460
I feel like...

1473
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,260
I guess it depends if we get...

1474
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,560
If we have three evacs, we can do the three evacs.

1475
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,280
If we don't, we can just do the don't use any.

1476
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,960
I guess it's just how many we get.

1477
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:22,980
Wait.

1478
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,440
Is the evac a survival item?

1479
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,800
I thought that meant like heals.

1480
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,240
Yeah.

1481
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:26,380
Yeah.

1482
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,240
No.

1483
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:27,860
It's just...

1484
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,280
Heat shields, mobi and...

1485
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,840
Yeah.

1486
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:30,980
That's a survival slot.

1487
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:31,320
Yeah.

1488
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,660
That's not health, is it?

1489
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:32,900
No.

1490
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:33,400
Wait.

1491
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,160
Is it survival?

1492
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,820
I mean, wouldn't that just be a white heal?

1493
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,480
Like, why would they call it a survival item?

1494
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,520
Because it helps you heal up.

1495
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,140
I guess.

1496
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:40,740
That's what I'm saying.

1497
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,020
Like, what's a survival item?

1498
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,920
Is survival item the heals or survival...

1499
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,600
It's just the survival items.

1500
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,180
That's what they're called.

1501
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,000
Like, the evacs and mobis.

1502
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,780
The keybind is like mobis.

1503
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:49,600
Oh.

1504
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah.

1505
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,920
It's called survival item on the keybind.

1506
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,240
Okay.

1507
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,860
So, we just don't use...

1508
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,420
We just don't care about that one.

1509
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:57,480
Yeah.

1510
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:10,480
But, unfortunately, we have to choose if we want to get that point or get the point of using three evac towers at the same time.

1511
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,080
I feel like...

1512
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,560
Whichever one comes first, right?

1513
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:12,800
Whichever one, yeah.

1514
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,700
If we die before then, then we technically, we, you know...

1515
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,560
Just don't use any until we get three.

1516
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,080
Yeah.

1517
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:18,600
Okay.

1518
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:18,980
Okay.

1519
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,200
Oh, shit.

1520
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,440
My dog is still on my stream.

1521
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,380
So, we're still on the tree, right?

1522
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:27,880
No.

1523
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:28,280
We're countdown.

1524
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:28,720
We're countdown.

1525
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,620
Oh, we're countdown now?

1526
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,340
Yeah.

1527
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:30,980
Oh, shit.

1528
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,580
I'm on Kasta.

1529
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,240
We could go for the...

1530
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:33,620
Gibby.

1531
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:34,820
Where's Gibby?

1532
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:35,820
Oh, I'm on her.

1533
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:36,440
Okay.

1534
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,840
I guess we're not doing that then.

1535
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:38,640
Okay.

1536
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,420
I'm staying low by then.

1537
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,120
Okay.

1538
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:41,580
Okay.

1539
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:42,500
That is actually awful.

1540
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,640
I didn't even know the game was starting.

1541
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,720
I was looking at the fucking...

1542
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,480
The thing.

1543
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:46,580
It's awesome.

1544
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,900
No, no.

1545
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,260
You're good.

1546
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,040
Can we get a restart?

1547
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,500
Let's get a restart, you're nuts.

1548
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:50,960
Wait, wait.

1549
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,180
See you crashed.

1550
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:51,880
See you crashed.

1551
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,280
Tell Temple your game crashed.

1552
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,600
I actually just got a degree.

1553
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:01,980
Okay.

1554
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:03,740
Wait.

1555
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,840
And we got no beacon?

1556
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:05,240
Wait.

1557
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,440
We're getting grieved.

1558
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,040
Tell your game you crashed.

1559
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:07,860
I hate it here.

1560
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:08,420
Tell Temple.

1561
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:09,820
Turn.

1562
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,480
I'm already trying to do it in scrims.

1563
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:11,560
Turn.

1564
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,320
Turn off your stream right now!

1565
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,720
Oh my god, when I just switched it to 90, my V is zoomed in so far.

1566
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:37,330
I mean we don't have a beacon, we just loot the POI and stack up all the alt-excells.

1567
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:38,210
We can alt three times still.

1568
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:40,730
Yeah, I mean we just need to do the Loba.

1569
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:42,890
Because Loba alt is so fast.

1570
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,770
I can hit the button in the middle for you guys.

1571
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,530
I'm just gonna run over here and start looting.

1572
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:49,490
You can loot all this.

1573
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,370
I'll loot this stuff.

1574
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:58,790
Remember no attachments, He-me.

1575
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,010
How could I forget?

1576
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:05,870
In theory, you could technically do that one.

1577
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,330
I could just do the no attachments and then pick up the care package guns.

1578
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,430
Let me do the no attachments.

1579
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:14,110
I'll just run sniper and pick up care package guns.

1580
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,470
But that means no scopes though, because it's not an attachment.

1581
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:19,770
It's alright.

1582
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,250
Yeah, no scopes either, but...

1583
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:26,800
Okay.

1584
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,020
I'm trying to find more shield cells.

1585
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,760
Well, it is pulling hard south.

1586
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,560
Unfortunately.

1587
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,260
Wait, can you give me your shield cells, He-me?

1588
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,540
I can literally do the heart right now.

1589
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:38,500
Okay.

1590
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:39,480
Alright.

1591
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,620
Wait, this is actually harder than I expected.

1592
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:46,740
Okay.

1593
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,260
Oh, I forgot to drop my shield.

1594
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,280
Okay.

1595
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:51,580
Oh, do I?

1596
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,620
That was the wrong nid.

1597
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:55,420
Oh, no.

1598
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:56,420
Wait.

1599
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,660
Oh, what'd it have to be?

1600
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,740
A frag grenade.

1601
01:02:59,220 --> 01:02:59,800
Here, here, here.

1602
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,440
Jesus Christ.

1603
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:01,580
Wait, I can do this.

1604
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,060
No, I think I'll die if I do that.

1605
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:04,800
No, you're good.

1606
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:05,040
You're good.

1607
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:05,980
It'll knock you no matter what.

1608
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:06,480
You won't fall down.

1609
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:06,960
You won't fall down.

1610
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:07,440
You're right.

1611
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,160
Oh, wrong one.

1612
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:08,400
We gotta go.

1613
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:09,820
Frag grenade.

1614
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,160
Frag grenade.

1615
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,460
We gotta go quick before this guy pulls up and kills us.

1616
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,080
Oh, my God.

1617
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,220
This heart is harder than I expected.

1618
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,560
Did you finish the heart?

1619
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,420
Wait.

1620
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:19,660
Wait.

1621
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:20,860
Technically, yes.

1622
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,880
I need more shield cells.

1623
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:23,660
I need more.

1624
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,180
Here, I'll give you here.

1625
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:24,360
Here, here.

1626
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:24,720
Take this.

1627
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,360
My ult.

1628
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,600
It's almost a heart.

1629
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,400
Do it quick and then we gotta dip because we're about to just die.

1630
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,040
Okay.

1631
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:31,480
Wait, wait, wait.

1632
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,500
Girl, what is this?

1633
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,240
It's technically a heart.

1634
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,160
If you look at it correctly.

1635
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:36,520
Oh, I'm not.

1636
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:37,540
Okay.

1637
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,260
That's a heart.

1638
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:38,860
Take the screenshot.

1639
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:39,440
That's a heart.

1640
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,080
We do it on the ball.

1641
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:40,380
We gotta go.

1642
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:40,680
That's a heart.

1643
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,240
That's a heart.

1644
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:41,400
That's a heart.

1645
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,710
Let's grab the support bin and then go for the beacon fissure and...

1646
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:47,760
That's a heart.

1647
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,580
Did you take a screenshot?

1648
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:49,640
I'm not gonna do that.

1649
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,840
We can just take it from the VOD.

1650
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,480
We can take it from the VOD.

1651
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,140
Yeah, yeah.

1652
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,540
We are shambles.

1653
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,820
We're no beacon too.

1654
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,060
White armor.

1655
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,120
Okay.

1656
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:58,520
All right.

1657
01:03:58,580 --> 01:03:59,560
Hit the support bin.

1658
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,400
There's no armors on the ground.

1659
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,260
Let's just go for it.

1660
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,920
We're just gonna go for Eva harvesters and stuff.

1661
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:03,500
Okay.

1662
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,140
We got the heart.

1663
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,840
We have to avoid people though because we have...

1664
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:08,800
Okay.

1665
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,960
How many nades do you guys?

1666
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,480
I have almost bottom row all our...

1667
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,500
I have zero nades.

1668
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:12,860
Okay.

1669
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,560
Give me your backpack.

1670
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,260
I can do it because I don't have attachments anyway so I don't need anything.

1671
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,480
I can just...

1672
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,560
And then you can drop me all your nades.

1673
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:19,640
Okay.

1674
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:21,900
I can just...

1675
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,340
I only need a couple...

1676
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,880
I only need four more grenades and then I can fix it.

1677
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:26,740
I don't have any.

1678
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:27,700
Let's go for the Eva harvester.

1679
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,660
I have so many shield cells though.

1680
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:30,940
That's fine.

1681
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:31,380
Can I have some?

1682
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,060
I only have two.

1683
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:32,340
Yeah.

1684
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:33,960
All right.

1685
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,060
We have to avoid everybody.

1686
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:35,960
We can't fight right now.

1687
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:36,180
Wait.

1688
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,320
What are the other things that we need to do that's easy?

1689
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,300
Three Eva harvesters, grenades in the backpack.

1690
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,680
I have not found a single nade.

1691
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,180
Here's one more nade.

1692
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:44,640
Here's one more nade.

1693
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:45,400
Hold on.

1694
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:46,100
I'm gonna grab this.

1695
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:46,400
I can take it.

1696
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,100
I can take it.

1697
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,420
and then I'll just transfer it over.

1698
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,520
I'm heading over to Senna.

1699
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,740
Can we go Fissure to hit Beacon?

1700
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:54,460
Yeah.

1701
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,400
But isn't there somebody at Fissure?

1702
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,640
They hit the UAV like...

1703
01:04:59,640 --> 01:04:59,880
Oh, no.

1704
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,220
They're still here.

1705
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:00,520
Back up.

1706
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:00,700
Back up.

1707
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,000
Yeah.

1708
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:01,580
Go up there.

1709
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:03,860
Pylon interceptions.

1710
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,200
Can we do first starter pylon interceptions?

1711
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:05,640
We can play for this.

1712
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:07,720
Play for what?

1713
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:08,640
What did you say?

1714
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,000
The Eva harvester over here.

1715
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:10,600
We need two more.

1716
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:11,380
Okay.

1717
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,180
I only need two more grenades and then I can actually pick up one.

1718
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:15,660
I have one here.

1719
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:16,820
Here.

1720
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:16,900
Yeah.

1721
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:17,620
Here.

1722
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:19,620
I'm looking for a grenade.

1723
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:19,760
I'm looking everywhere.

1724
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,580
And we can play for care packages too.

1725
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,880
I just got to remember not to pick up attachments.

1726
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:27,660
I know.

1727
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,900
I saw someone over there just now.

1728
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:32,380
Yeah.

1729
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,000
Let's go this way then.

1730
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,560
I have zero white.

1731
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,680
We might just be sitting in...

1732
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,920
We might just sit in zone half the game.

1733
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:42,480
I'm not going to lie.

1734
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,380
There's a vault here.

1735
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:43,940
We can get this vault.

1736
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:44,760
They're fighting up here.

1737
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,860
We might be able to do a third party this.

1738
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:46,560
Yeah.

1739
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:46,820
Oh.

1740
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,140
That's smart.

1741
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:49,520
This right here.

1742
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,280
I'm just going to try to knock one with Sentinel and get the...

1743
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:53,720
You get the challenge.

1744
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,020
Yeah.

1745
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,720
I was going to say, is that smart to...

1746
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:56,720
They're moving back.

1747
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,360
They're moving to you.

1748
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:58,560
They're coming to you.

1749
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,000
They're coming to you.

1750
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,280
Yeah.

1751
01:05:59,380 --> 01:05:59,620
I'm running.

1752
01:05:59,760 --> 01:05:59,860
I'm running.

1753
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,140
Go.

1754
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:00,360
Go.

1755
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:00,440
Go.

1756
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:00,580
Go.

1757
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:00,860
Go.

1758
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:00,980
Go.

1759
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,080
Go.

1760
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:01,160
Go.

1761
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:01,280
Go.

1762
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:01,360
Go.

1763
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:01,540
Go.

1764
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:01,740
Go.

1765
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:02,460
Go.

1766
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:02,620
Go.

1767
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,000
Go.

1768
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:04,680
Go.

1769
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:24,020
I'm running.

1770
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:24,520
This is awful.

1771
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,080
I need two more grenades and I can pick up loot.

1772
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:29,260
I can throw my ult.

1773
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,400
I can throw my ult, but like...

1774
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,440
I'm not here.

1775
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:32,340
Let's do it.

1776
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:32,660
I know.

1777
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:33,700
Let's do it up here.

1778
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,760
I'm staging side.

1779
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:35,440
Okay.

1780
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,480
Let's see if I can...

1781
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,020
Look into staging.

1782
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,240
We're actually just passive this challenge.

1783
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:40,520
Let's see.

1784
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,420
No nades.

1785
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,480
No nades.

1786
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:43,740
Maybe here?

1787
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,000
Vince?

1788
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,040
Vince?

1789
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:46,680
No nades.

1790
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,100
I got one.

1791
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:48,280
Oh.

1792
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:48,480
Thermite.

1793
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,360
Oh my God.

1794
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:49,680
I got it.

1795
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,040
I got it.

1796
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:50,360
I got it.

1797
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,060
I don't have any loot.

1798
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:54,460
I don't have any loot.

1799
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:54,660
Back up.

1800
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:54,820
Back up.

1801
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:54,920
Back up.

1802
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:55,800
I'm gonna port.

1803
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,200
Play on the trailer and stay healthy.

1804
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:57,580
I'm gonna port.

1805
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:58,240
Okay.

1806
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,360
Tell me if I need to drop it.

1807
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,200
I'm looking.

1808
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,640
I don't see them yet.

1809
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,120
We're gonna have to just run into a zone because I don't have loot to fight.

1810
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,320
Bloodhound ult.

1811
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,020
Okay.

1812
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:09,460
I'm dropping it now.

1813
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,160
They're to my left.

1814
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:11,660
They're to my left.

1815
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:16,750
There's a guy above us in countdown.

1816
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:17,110
Come back.

1817
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:17,330
Come back.

1818
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:17,490
Come back.

1819
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:17,690
Whoa!

1820
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:19,670
Wow.

1821
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:20,690
This is scary.

1822
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:21,610
We need to go far.

1823
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:22,830
This is so scary.

1824
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:26,350
We are just little rats.

1825
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,510
How many White Heels do you have?

1826
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,530
I have two Phoenix Kits.

1827
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:31,230
I have two Med Kits as well.

1828
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:34,170
We just have to loot the zone.

1829
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:36,130
We can use your ult here.

1830
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,410
You have enough to sustain for a little bit.

1831
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,330
I'm going to go grab the Evil Harvester.

1832
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,410
You might as well use your ult to get one of the other challenges.

1833
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:44,970
You can spam yours if you want.

1834
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:45,850
You can pop it up there.

1835
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:46,490
Or wherever.

1836
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,070
It doesn't matter.

1837
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:48,450
I'm stuck.

1838
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:49,990
No!

1839
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,570
Let's go to Monument.

1840
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:55,310
Okay.

1841
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,950
I'm going to need some White Heels from somebody.

1842
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:00,670
You can give it to him.

1843
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:03,170
I have four Syringes and one Phoenix Kit.

1844
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,510
Okay.

1845
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,750
I have three Syringes.

1846
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:06,290
Give me a couple.

1847
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:06,810
I have zero.

1848
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:08,090
We just need to get into Monument.

1849
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:08,350
We're little rats.

1850
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:09,930
We're little rats.

1851
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:10,990
I'm just going to run for now.

1852
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,390
At least I can pick up loot now.

1853
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:14,530
True.

1854
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:15,710
Rats.

1855
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:16,050
Rats.

1856
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:17,850
We are the rats.

1857
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,210
This is like the most...

1858
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,890
The poorest I've ever been in Apex Legends.

1859
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:25,410
Yeah.

1860
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:25,910
This is awful.

1861
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,730
Are you entertaining chat?

1862
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:31,690
It's the ghetto.

1863
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:31,950
Okay.

1864
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:33,810
Senox, here's some of these Syringes.

1865
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,830
Thank you.

1866
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:35,610
Oh, I have a Med Kit.

1867
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,290
Oh, just one.

1868
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:38,070
What is this?

1869
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:38,550
That's fine.

1870
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:38,870
That's fine.

1871
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,130
I can give you one Phoenix Kit.

1872
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,930
We get it off of this Evo.

1873
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:42,390
We get the...

1874
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:43,130
Oh, keep it in front of us.

1875
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:43,550
Okay.

1876
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:44,370
Do they see us?

1877
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:45,650
Oh, I hope not.

1878
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:47,930
Well, I'm just chilling in this corner.

1879
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:48,210
They see us.

1880
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:48,710
I'm not peeking.

1881
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:49,410
I'm just going to let...

1882
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:51,070
I'm chilling in this corner.

1883
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:51,610
They're running right now.

1884
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:52,610
They're going left-stroke.

1885
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:55,430
When... Alright.

1886
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:59,330
We need to have another ult and also grab that Harvester.

1887
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:00,250
And then we should be good.

1888
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:00,290
Yeah.

1889
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,310
I'm going for the Harvester right now.

1890
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:03,710
We got to work the zone because we don't have enough Whitelands to stay here.

1891
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:04,890
They're shooting someone else.

1892
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:04,910
Wait.

1893
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:05,530
I heard someone shooting.

1894
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:07,230
I'm going to go for the Evo Harvester.

1895
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:07,350
Right here.

1896
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:07,810
Right here.

1897
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,910
I'm going to grab this and then come back.

1898
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:13,370
Should we just go train side?

1899
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:14,250
Yeah.

1900
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:16,610
I had to drop the Vulcan.

1901
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,710
I didn't even get to pick it up.

1902
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:18,790
I had to grab the Neds.

1903
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:19,950
I don't even know if we have enough...

1904
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,130
Let's check Harvester.

1905
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:22,590
I think we have enough.

1906
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:23,130
I think we have to go through Harvester.

1907
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:23,810
We have 30 seconds.

1908
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,270
There is a team to our left though.

1909
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:27,810
They... Was it the one that Valk ulted?

1910
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:28,350
Yeah.

1911
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:30,530
There was a Valk ult but I think they were shooting at someone.

1912
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:31,650
Okay.

1913
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:32,170
Just be careful.

1914
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:33,030
Alright.

1915
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:35,810
I still don't even have ammo.

1916
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:36,770
This is awful.

1917
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:36,910
Wait.

1918
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:37,450
What ammo do you need?

1919
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,110
Oh my gosh.

1920
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:39,330
You have the most niche ammo too.

1921
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,530
Shotgun and Sniper.

1922
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:41,590
I would love to help you.

1923
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:41,930
Shotgun?

1924
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:43,430
Oh yeah.

1925
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:43,970
No.

1926
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:45,750
I can't use a gun with attachments.

1927
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:48,010
My ult is at 1080.

1928
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:48,570
Yeah.

1929
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:49,570
Let's go Harvester and LeBolt.

1930
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,850
And then I'll have Port.

1931
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:53,330
We have to try to Port in the zone and survive.

1932
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:57,290
I guess we don't use any survival items.

1933
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:57,970
We don't have any either.

1934
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,030
Do you have your another ult yet?

1935
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,170
Not yet.

1936
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,390
I just had an 80.

1937
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,010
Oh 80?

1938
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:02,350
Okay.

1939
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:05,270
The moment you do it, just chuck it there and then mark it off.

1940
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:06,630
Let's go throw on med kits on the crafter.

1941
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,510
Just place it out because there might be someone here.

1942
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:09,650
But...

1943
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:11,830
I'm going to close the door so we know.

1944
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:16,550
Can we hit the... Could you hit the beacon maybe?

1945
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:17,150
So we get purple?

1946
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:18,090
Yeah.

1947
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:20,590
Alright guys.

1948
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:22,070
Yay we have our ult too.

1949
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,790
They might know we're here now though.

1950
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,290
But we can mark that off.

1951
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:26,450
This is my third ult right?

1952
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:27,430
Yeah that's your third one.

1953
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:28,170
Yeah that's third.

1954
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:31,510
Alright.

1955
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,070
Fighting behind us.

1956
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:34,890
Harvester show.

1957
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:37,850
Alright let's work towards... we gotta get in the zone.

1958
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:38,730
We're gonna dive.

1959
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:39,430
We're shambles dude.

1960
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:41,650
I'm gonna grab a med kit then just in case.

1961
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:42,590
Yeah I'm throwing on a med kit.

1962
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,110
Actually I need to throw on a bat.

1963
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,190
I don't have any shield heals either.

1964
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:45,810
I can chop you bats.

1965
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:48,250
There's another LeBolt right?

1966
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:48,810
Yeah.

1967
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:52,670
I'm throwing on some meds then we should get going.

1968
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:56,790
This team might try to gatekeep us so I'm gonna go ahead.

1969
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,950
Does my P20 need no attachments or it doesn't matter?

1970
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:05,510
Oh no he can have attachments cause Synax is running no attachments.

1971
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:05,870
Okay okay.

1972
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,370
I didn't know if the P20 had to be naked.

1973
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:09,550
Careful there was people on the right.

1974
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:10,490
They might be walking up.

1975
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:11,730
Flying over us.

1976
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:13,410
Two teams flying in.

1977
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:14,270
On bridge.

1978
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:14,630
They're on bridge.

1979
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:14,830
On bridge.

1980
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,670
Woah.

1981
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:19,970
Wait there's an evil harvester.

1982
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:20,570
That's Blaston.

1983
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:21,550
The last evil harvester.

1984
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:23,270
We already got three.

1985
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:23,590
I thought we did it.

1986
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:24,290
We got three?

1987
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:25,190
I thought we got two.

1988
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:25,550
I thought we did three.

1989
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:26,110
Oh.

1990
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:26,750
Yeah we have three.

1991
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:27,010
We have three.

1992
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:27,730
Okay.

1993
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:28,670
I didn't hear any of them.

1994
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:29,610
You see how many people are above us?

1995
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:30,470
No.

1996
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:32,330
We need to just get in.

1997
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:33,870
They know they landed on bridge though is all.

1998
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:35,090
Yeah I'm walking up.

1999
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:36,530
Someone look at the bridge when we get up here.

2000
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,760
I'm gonna try to scout some other way.

2001
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,500
They're on the platform.

2002
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,060
They're on the platform.

2003
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:44,880
Yeah.

2004
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:46,560
Oh they ulted too.

2005
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,340
You see anybody in this building?

2006
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,620
Yeah there's a team there.

2007
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:51,940
There's another team that read the polls.

2008
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:52,260
Damn that weed arc sucks.

2009
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:52,700
There's another team that read the polls.

2010
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,560
We need to deploy to the bridge too.

2011
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,600
There's another team on bridge.

2012
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:54,840
Just right.

2013
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,140
Just right.

2014
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:55,440
Just right.

2015
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,160
They might fight and we're gonna have to throw it out.

2016
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,580
There's like people everywhere and we don't have any evokes.

2017
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:00,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2018
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,380
I saw them run from uh, we deployed to the bridge.

2019
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,160
Do you have uh, do you have cells?

2020
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,360
Uh yeah.

2021
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,200
Do you need?

2022
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,360
I wanna charge this cause it's my only gun.

2023
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:14,020
Woo.

2024
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,460
They're trying to get those charge sentries off.

2025
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,620
We might have to just hug Logon and run in with them.

2026
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,640
We have like no time.

2027
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,080
I still have port so.

2028
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:30,040
No team is dying though.

2029
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:31,880
That's the scary part.

2030
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,400
They're still right in front of us.

2031
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,000
These guys aren't moving.

2032
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,720
Just go left, just go left.

2033
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,920
They're waiting too.

2034
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,960
They're all waiting and they're just gonna valko.

2035
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,880
We don't have valk though.

2036
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,220
This is awful.

2037
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,380
It's been scuffed since the beginning.

2038
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,620
Come in the RV and rat.

2039
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,740
Come in the RV and rat.

2040
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,020
Nothing good has happened since the start.

2041
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,860
Here's some shield cells.

2042
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,600
Yeah we got the all.

2043
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,060
Let's go.

2044
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:08,140
We're just gonna have to run in last second and I'm gonna pray I can hit the goat or something.

2045
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,960
We just don't have valk here.

2046
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:12,260
Is there nobody?

2047
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,180
Can we move forward here?

2048
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,660
All in on Senox right here.

2049
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,640
There might be a team in this building so we just gotta go together.

2050
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:17,500
Alright.

2051
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:21,710
All in.

2052
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:23,470
I'm running forward and going for a point.

2053
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:24,630
I'm running forward and going for a point.

2054
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,490
I don't even know where I'm gonna be able to get it to be honest.

2055
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:29,070
It's okay.

2056
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,670
I fully trust you.

2057
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,530
I stopped trusting.

2058
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:34,350
I stopped trusting.

2059
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:37,630
I'm dropping here for now.

2060
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:38,070
You can take it.

2061
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:38,990
We're starting to save here.

2062
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:39,550
Can you get a gen down?

2063
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,370
I think we're good here.

2064
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,430
We have to shoot this.

2065
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,350
We have to shoot on my ping.

2066
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:43,050
I'm genning.

2067
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:44,470
You're right here.

2068
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:44,930
Shoot this.

2069
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:45,130
Shoot this.

2070
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:45,330
Shoot this.

2071
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:47,910
This team's on our right as well.

2072
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:48,350
Careful.

2073
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:48,450
Careful.

2074
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:48,830
I got him.

2075
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:49,230
I got him.

2076
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:49,630
I got him.

2077
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:51,090
He's resing though.

2078
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:51,590
He's resing.

2079
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:52,130
We have to kill this.

2080
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:52,730
We have to kill this team.

2081
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:53,330
We have to kill that team.

2082
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:54,430
I'm looking.

2083
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,150
I'm looking.

2084
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:55,830
I'm looking for you.

2085
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,350
Trying to cancel that.

2086
01:13:58,990 --> 01:13:59,310
Here.

2087
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,110
We're running up.

2088
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:00,450
Oh, no.

2089
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:01,330
Goodbye.

2090
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:03,690
In the corner right here.

2091
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:03,850
80?

2092
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:04,290
Yeah.

2093
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:04,790
I'm looking.

2094
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:06,070
I'm seven.

2095
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:07,190
I'm throwing all my arcs in that corner.

2096
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:07,890
Whoa.

2097
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:11,150
You hit my little shield.

2098
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:11,890
I'm farming.

2099
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:12,270
I'm farming.

2100
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:12,770
We can kill this guys.

2101
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:13,030
Flash.

2102
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,250
Flash.

2103
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,510
Flash.

2104
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:14,470
He's flashed.

2105
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:16,530
Cracked one.

2106
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:17,530
Cracked another one.

2107
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:19,850
Oh my god.

2108
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:20,390
I just took it.

2109
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:20,750
Wait, wait.

2110
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:21,250
I'm actually trying...

2111
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:21,630
It's where?

2112
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:22,270
It's horrible bro.

2113
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:22,630
It's horrible.

2114
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,630
No, and it's out!

2115
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:25,110
No fucking way.

2116
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:26,950
I'm Q, I'm Q.

2117
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:27,650
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

2118
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,270
Do we, uh, do you have low bolt?

2119
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:31,670
Do you have low bolt?

2120
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:32,670
I'm gonna pop ulti so it's support.

2121
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:33,450
No, no, no.

2122
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:34,610
We have to just, just play to kill them.

2123
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:35,390
We have to kill them.

2124
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:36,770
Look at them, look at them, look at them.

2125
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,010
Shoot the fuck off.

2126
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,650
Oh, I couldn't get it.

2127
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:40,490
I got like...

2128
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:41,750
Crack him.

2129
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,010
I almost cracked it.

2130
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:45,750
Alright, do you have low bolt maybe?

2131
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:46,950
No, yeah.

2132
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:47,430
No.

2133
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:51,530
There's a team above us, a team above us.

2134
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:52,150
Yep.

2135
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,430
Wait, I don't need this maybe.

2136
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,090
I have port, I have port.

2137
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:58,470
Okay, I'm pro- oh this sucks.

2138
01:14:58,690 --> 01:14:59,670
There's actually so many people.

2139
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:03,650
I don't see a team directly above- Are they just in here, riding?

2140
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:04,430
Like, where are they?

2141
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:05,470
I heard footsteps.

2142
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,430
I'm gonna go scout it, I'm gonna go scout it.

2143
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:09,170
Let's just all go together.

2144
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,530
They're right here, they're right here.

2145
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:11,130
They're just jumping out.

2146
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:11,870
They're jumping down on the left.

2147
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:13,290
We can just mirror this.

2148
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:14,490
Yeah, yeah.

2149
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:15,870
They scanned it.

2150
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:19,610
I might have to port up through here and just get a port and a lower launch, maybe.

2151
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,270
So I think they're holding the round.

2152
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:23,610
Yeah, they're hard holding.

2153
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:24,490
We gotta go around, we gotta go around.

2154
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,590
We have to go now.

2155
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:28,090
Yep, I'm gonna bat and then port from the corner.

2156
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:28,990
There's a team in this building, okay?

2157
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:29,330
Up here?

2158
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:30,030
There definitely is.

2159
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:31,490
Alright, good luck!

2160
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:32,610
Actually, just run it, just run it.

2161
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:33,410
I think they're all gonna bot-cult.

2162
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:35,550
Jesus Christ.

2163
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,330
Come off, come off, come off, come off.

2164
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:40,890
There's a lot of barrels.

2165
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:44,290
I'm gonna drop a corn up here for you.

2166
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:45,010
Oh, I used a raw fucking gun for this.

2167
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:47,530
Alright.

2168
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:48,210
Ow.

2169
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,110
Do you have gen?

2170
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:54,490
No, 72.

2171
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:55,810
Okay.

2172
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:01,950
You have to come and instantly look right, instantly look right.

2173
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:02,890
There's a team on our right, team on our right.

2174
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:04,750
Try to gen if you have it soon.

2175
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:05,450
I don't, yeah, yeah.

2176
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:10,730
Okay, we try to, we watch the walk-in and then we try to look left at third party and get some kills.

2177
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:12,990
A full team's gonna walk up right here.

2178
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:13,790
We have to be the one to climb.

2179
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:14,970
Okay.

2180
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:17,690
I'm looking.

2181
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,310
There's a full team behind us right here as well.

2182
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:19,990
Behind this rock.

2183
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,990
Behind this rock, they're shooting the rock now.

2184
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:22,650
Cracked on?

2185
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:24,190
Right here?

2186
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:25,330
They killed the team.

2187
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,730
This rock, this rock, they're in front.

2188
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,730
I'm looking, I'm looking at this, I'm looking at this rock.

2189
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,130
There's a team riding in this corner right here.

2190
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:32,970
We might have to go kill them.

2191
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:35,130
Or directly above us.

2192
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:36,750
I have scans above 95%.

2193
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:37,730
Can you level up?

2194
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:38,810
Yep.

2195
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:40,170
Okay.

2196
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:41,130
Sold this.

2197
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,430
Oh my god, care package guns.

2198
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,590
I'm just grabbing both.

2199
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:50,890
Okay, we need to look to kill them.

2200
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:52,390
I think there's still a team riding above us.

2201
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:54,430
They're sitting in this corner right above us.

2202
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:54,850
We have nades.

2203
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:57,370
Do you have any nades?

2204
01:16:57,870 --> 01:16:58,870
No, no nades.

2205
01:16:59,050 --> 01:16:59,910
You can look in the...

2206
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:01,530
There's nades here.

2207
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:02,330
I have gold knock.

2208
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:02,750
I have gold knock.

2209
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:03,110
Here, here.

2210
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:04,290
Here's a nade.

2211
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:05,370
I'm not...

2212
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:06,150
There's nobody here.

2213
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,750
I'm gonna drop this.

2214
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:08,690
Drop the knock.

2215
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:09,370
They're riding in this corner.

2216
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:10,190
Can we try to kill them maybe?

2217
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,290
Can someone grab this knock?

2218
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:13,250
I can grab it.

2219
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:13,910
I got it.

2220
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,710
I threw a nade here for you.

2221
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:16,790
Any ulti cells?

2222
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:17,910
Can I get gold helmet?

2223
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:20,270
Yeah, here.

2224
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:23,230
I'm gonna grab the nade.

2225
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:24,530
Any ulti cells?

2226
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,830
I'm gonna grab the nade.

2227
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:25,270
I'm not gonna have port.

2228
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,570
Yeah, I've got one here.

2229
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:28,010
Nope, I don't have any.

2230
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:31,430
Yeah, I'm just gonna go for another port and we're gonna have to pray it's fucking decent.

2231
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,830
Maybe you can try to see if you can kidnap somebody.

2232
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:37,050
Can we wrap the logon and try to kill this team?

2233
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,150
They're sitting like right in this corner.

2234
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:39,150
Oh, there's a team right above.

2235
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:40,170
I'm gonna port.

2236
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:40,510
I'm gonna port.

2237
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,830
I'm gonna port.

2238
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,570
I mean, if you want to just go for the kidnap.

2239
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,990
Oh, true.

2240
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,250
True?

2241
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:46,650
Just like it.

2242
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:48,790
We both said true as fuck.

2243
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:51,250
I mean, that's like...

2244
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:51,570
Okay, take port.

2245
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:51,870
Take port.

2246
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:52,090
Take port.

2247
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:52,810
Okay.

2248
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:55,910
They're good.

2249
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:56,130
They're good.

2250
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:56,490
Hug the wall.

2251
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:56,810
Hug the wall.

2252
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:57,470
We're safe here.

2253
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:57,890
We're safe here.

2254
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:58,770
They're evac'ing right above us.

2255
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:00,030
Just look up.

2256
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:00,870
Just get fences and look up.

2257
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,110
They're sitting right above us.

2258
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,170
We gotta get a logon here.

2259
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:03,950
We gotta get a logon here.

2260
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:04,950
Yeah, we can look.

2261
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,270
We can look.

2262
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:06,310
Just wait for zone to close.

2263
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:06,630
I'm marking it.

2264
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:08,670
They have to take it up and we have to knock.

2265
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:10,750
They're gonna peek above us.

2266
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:11,810
The only place they kill us is above.

2267
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,890
I'm gonna make sure nobody takes our port.

2268
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:17,350
Oh my god.

2269
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:18,850
They're just sitting above us still.

2270
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,150
They have caustic.

2271
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:20,730
Take port.

2272
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:20,930
Take port.

2273
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:20,990
Take port.

2274
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:22,070
Take port.

2275
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,150
Oh, there they are.

2276
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:25,250
Wait, wait, wait.

2277
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:25,550
I'm on this.

2278
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:25,670
I'm up.

2279
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:27,110
I'm fighting.

2280
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,050
Oh no.

2281
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:29,690
I'm healing.

2282
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:29,990
I'm healing.

2283
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:31,510
No, I'm dead.

2284
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:34,450
I can't wait the moment I turn around from the portal to...

2285
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:40,020
In case the Nox live.

2286
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,400
Is that considered a kitnaft?

2287
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:42,680
If you think it is.

2288
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:42,960
He's finishing me.

2289
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:43,580
Oh, no.

2290
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,960
He's giving me the finishing.

2291
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:47,080
Wait, should I go pop a finisher on this guy?

2292
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:47,400
Yes.

2293
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,020
Yes, you should.

2294
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:48,420
Yes, you should.

2295
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,620
Wait, his teammates are on him.

2296
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,380
It's all 10.

2297
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:50,440
No.

2298
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:50,820
It's okay.

2299
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:51,700
Just try and get anything.

2300
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,160
Just try and get anything.

2301
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:54,480
He's finishing me.

2302
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,260
They're resing it.

2303
01:18:59,380 --> 01:18:59,740
They're resing it.

2304
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,860
I have no meds and no ammo.

2305
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:02,480
It's okay!

2306
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,660
Just get a knock if you can!

2307
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:09,720
Now that we're dead, we can start marking off stuff on the card.

2308
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:16,930
Oh... that is a good spot.

2309
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:19,510
Oh no!

2310
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:20,510
Oh no!

2311
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:21,210
Look!

2312
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,890
If they can't see you, you can't see them too.

2313
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:28,530
Oh wait, yeah, we got the one with the care package gun kill because I killed that Lifeline.

2314
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:29,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2315
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:31,250
Care package gun kill.

2316
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,650
Unfortunately, not looking too good.

2317
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:35,550
We didn't use a survival item.

2318
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:36,510
Oh, true!

2319
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:36,870
We got the heart.

2320
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,110
I got the knock.

2321
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:42,430
I'm gonna go for the kidnap for the point.

2322
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:44,090
Okay, I'm gonna shut up and count.

2323
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,640
Where are they?

2324
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,540
I got them!

2325
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:52,960
Yes!

2326
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:53,440
Yes!

2327
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:53,800
Kidnap!

2328
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:54,760
We did it!

2329
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,900
Wait, did you actually?

2330
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:57,840
Yeah.

2331
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,440
It's okay, we got the kidnap!

2332
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,960
Okay, so hang on.

2333
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:04,200
I count.

2334
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:05,640
One...

2335
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:14,420
So from the top, we got FOV, three eva harvesters, nades, You only had two care pack weapons, right?

2336
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,220
Yeah, we only had the two.

2337
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:16,940
Did you guys have any?

2338
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,280
No, I didn't.

2339
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,360
You didn't get any knocks with the sniper, did you?

2340
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,920
No, I got one shot.

2341
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:29,240
Got the frag knock, got the shield cells, got the no attachments, and got the ult three times.

2342
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,540
And you got the knock with the care package.

2343
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,040
That's nine.

2344
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,320
We did the heart?

2345
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:34,020
Did we get the heart?

2346
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:34,820
Yeah.

2347
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,240
Okay, heart.

2348
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:36,700
Oh, nice!

2349
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,040
Good job.

2350
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,600
Damn, if we had one more care pack, that actually wouldn't have been a ton.

2351
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,380
I know!

2352
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,880
I mean, ten was the winning last time.

2353
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,280
Yeah.

2354
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,200
But I think now people know.

2355
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,620
But this time, people didn't play comp, so...

2356
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,900
Yeah, people already know what to do, though.

2357
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:56,480
Yeah.

2358
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,020
Alright.

2359
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:58,300
Did we not get...

2360
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,940
We didn't get any knocks with the P20, right?

2361
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:00,980
No.

2362
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:05,620
No, I shot at the lifeline, but I think you got that one, which is still a win.

2363
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,240
We got nine.

2364
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,280
We're team six, and we got nine.

2365
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:12,280
Yeah!

2366
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,520
Typing that was very satisfying.

2367
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,080
We improved!

2368
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,000
And the team above was fourth on team 20!

2369
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,340
Not a joke, that's hilarious.

2370
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,560
I've never played a more shambles Apex Legends game.

2371
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,220
That was so rough.

2372
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:33,880
I felt like you know it was going to be rough when, you know, we already picked the wrong characters.

2373
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:35,800
I know.

2374
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,160
It was raps after that.

2375
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:40,600
Honestly, that one, the fuckup got us two points, though.

2376
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,500
We got the care package and the kidnap.

2377
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,640
That's true, that's true.

2378
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,700
But that was like, honestly, I was awful.

2379
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,080
the most scuffed game I've ever played.

2380
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,320
I was awful.

2381
01:21:58,620 --> 01:21:59,540
Somebody got 11?

2382
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,840
It was third!

2383
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,800
Even though that doesn't mean we win anything.

2384
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:10,780
Oh wait, no, no, no, they didn't get 11, they got, it was team 11 that got seven.

2385
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:11,880
Seven came in.

2386
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,980
Well, the team got ten anyways, unfortunately.

2387
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:14,520
Yeah.

2388
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,440
But we're in the top percentile.

2389
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:19,540
We got nine!

2390
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,780
Good stuff, guys.

2391
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:25,940
Honestly, they were not too bad to do in the POI before we leave.

2392
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,620
Were we kind of in shambles without the rotate?

2393
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,660
Yes, but...

2394
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:32,100
Yeah, I think it was smart to just do all the challenges on the POI and then start leaving.

2395
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,720
Because everybody is Valk.

2396
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:40,280
Everybody was Valk, so it didn't hurt us rotating because everyone was just Valk rotating out.

2397
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,480
There's actually so many teams on edge.

2398
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,920
Almost every single team just sits in their POI doing the challenges.

2399
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:47,020
Yeah, everybody did.

2400
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,240
Almost every team had nine.

2401
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:59,700
I guess we gotta, for the last game, we need to try to do the ones quick, and then I think we should look for a third party so we can get the knocks with the guns and then like a...

2402
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,360
Because we can stick a down person too and then finish them.

2403
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,260
That would have been a lot.

2404
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,700
One of us gave that one team a finisher.

2405
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,820
Yeah, Gibby's ass sat on me, bro.

2406
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,460
Just mean...

2407
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,440
Okay, I can do the heart again.

2408
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,700
It's so...

2409
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:25,040
I didn't realize how... I forgot like...

2410
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,420
The shield cells...

2411
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:28,200
They can go anywhere.

2412
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,120
That's the worst part.

2413
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:38,330
My little scuffed heart.

2414
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,360
Guys...

2415
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:49,760
Why was the heart a challenge?

2416
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,860
I thought like... I was like, oh yeah, that's easy.

2417
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,940
I can like just put down my shield.

2418
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,980
And I was like, wait.

2419
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,400
Wait a minute.

2420
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,200
You cannot just put down your shields.

2421
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,220
You see the... I mean like...

2422
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,860
If we're talking about abstract here...

2423
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,800
Like abstract wise...

2424
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,800
It sort of looked like a heart.

2425
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,060
Oh my god.

2426
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:15,980
That was...

2427
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,520
That was fucking rough.

2428
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:20,120
I think I spent like...

2429
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,900
Like 80% of the time in that...

2430
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:23,900
In our POI.

2431
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,480
Just trying to make that fucking one heart.

2432
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,460
It's a mod in our...

2433
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,500
A team got 13.

2434
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:33,660
Holy shit.

2435
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,960
What the fuck did you do?

2436
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,260
We have one team that had 13.

2437
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,640
Welp.

2438
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,540
It's okay.

2439
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:47,260
Top 5.

2440
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:48,600
I think.

2441
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,040
I mean from 3...

2442
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,760
From 3...

2443
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,980
To like...

2444
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,200
To 9 points?

2445
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:58,780
That's pretty good.

2446
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:00,840
That's pretty good.

2447
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:05,340
Top 5?

2448
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:05,700
Top 5?

2449
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:05,700
No.

2450
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,500
No, no, no.

2451
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,140
Top 5.

2452
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,100
Top 5.

2453
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,360
Spam cells and then remove to get the heart.

2454
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,720
Okay, but then you find enough cells for that.

2455
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:18,040
The hardest part was that I did not have enough cells for that.

2456
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:19,340
The hardest part was that I did not have enough cells for that.

2457
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:19,840
That was the...

2458
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,820
That was the hardest part.

2459
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:23,540
Improvement!

2460
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:23,860
Exactly!

2461
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,000
Every game we improve.

2462
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:26,780
Chat.

2463
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,340
That's all that matters.

2464
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,320
If every game we improve...

2465
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,960
If every game we improve... Do we have POIs yet?

2466
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,220
Then that's all that matters.

2467
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:34,960
Epi Center?

2468
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:35,800
Oh my...

2469
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,740
Okay, we have Survey too?

2470
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:37,100
Thanks.

2471
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:38,720
Oh, that's pretty good.

2472
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,860
I thought it was just Epi.

2473
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,160
Alright, Epi Survey.

2474
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,320
What's the loot path?

2475
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:49,900
One person Survey, one person Epi, one person Skyhook Tunnel.

2476
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:51,760
Skyhook Tunnel?

2477
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:52,880
Oh!

2478
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:54,440
Well that's what it is in comp.

2479
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:55,900
I don't know if people will...

2480
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,380
Well, I mean everybody has like one pro player.

2481
01:25:59,540 --> 01:25:59,640
Well, I mean everybody has like one pro player.

2482
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,740
I guess everyone has their set drop spots too.

2483
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:02,980
I can do the tunnel.

2484
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,460
Just in case there's people up there, I can just run away or some shit.

2485
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,660
And then one person Epi, and wherever the beacon is you can just land on.

2486
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:10,820
Oh my gosh.

2487
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,400
We're Gibby, Caustic, Valk, so...

2488
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,880
I don't really have a preference on where.

2489
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,700
Do you mind, Widoki, where you land?

2490
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,280
I don't mind.

2491
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,840
I don't really have a preference.

2492
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:22,180
Caustic, just go Epi if there's beacon.

2493
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:22,820
Yeah.

2494
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,340
I'll just go to the beacon.

2495
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:26,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2496
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:27,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2497
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:29,600
Um...

2498
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,780
Should I do the no attachment one again?

2499
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:33,780
Okay, Epi.

2500
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,360
I'll go where the beacon...

2501
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,380
I had to make it P20 for most of that game.

2502
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,400
I feel like...

2503
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:43,360
I feel like the P20 person should have the no attachments in the end.

2504
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:43,520
I feel like the P20 person should have the no attachments in the end.

2505
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,180
That's what I feel like too.

2506
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,440
I feel like it's just easier to like...

2507
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,420
It's just... justify.

2508
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:49,040
You do the attachments, I'll do the grenade one then.

2509
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:50,060
Okay.

2510
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,780
Yeah, yeah.

2511
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:52,380
That sounds good.

2512
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,020
Yeah, that sounds good.

2513
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:55,240
And then I...

2514
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,200
make the heart.

2515
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:56,380
Alright.

2516
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:02,060
I feel like I'm gonna waste most of my time trying to do that.

2517
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,960
No, you're actually different on the no.

2518
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,340
From the one game you like practice.

2519
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:08,540
You're right.

2520
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,860
I have the experience now.

2521
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:10,660
It should be easy.

2522
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,940
It should be easy.

2523
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,480
Guys, where are my clips?

2524
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,560
Guys, where are my...

2525
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,800
Where are my...

2526
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,540
Guys!

2527
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,220
You can't say clip that!

2528
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,800
I still don't see any clips in the Doki Clips... in the Doki Clips hashtag!

2529
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,340
Too busy watching...

2530
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:33,680
Too busy watching... I'm still just gonna run a sniper every game and try to knock somebody.

2531
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,120
Do something...

2532
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,360
What do you mean?!

2533
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,840
My entire existence is funny.

2534
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,380
This is why I'm a streamer!

2535
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:48,000
My entire life is a joke.

2536
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,420
Ah, too real.

2537
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,240
Too real.

2538
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,480
Alright, we have...

2539
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,360
I feel like... Hey, we're faster now!

2540
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,400
One hour a game!

2541
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:00,440
It is 30... 40 minutes a game.

2542
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,960
We're like cutting down our time.

2543
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,420
We're speedrunning this.

2544
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,060
Chat, that's great.

2545
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:06,940
Thank God.

2546
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:08,880
We made it pretty far though.

2547
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,580
I don't think I can play like six hours.

2548
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,460
I don't think I can do six hours.

2549
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,660
It'd be a lot easier if you get a good zone.

2550
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:17,780
Because you can just do all the things sitting in zone and then you just get everything else done.

2551
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:18,900
Because you're just in God's spot.

2552
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,100
Like just bugging people and stuff.

2553
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:24,340
Doki the Joker, take your time.

2554
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:25,340
Doki the Joker, take your time.

2555
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:26,180
But yeah, we still have...

2556
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,300
But yeah, we still have...

2557
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,280
We still have four more games left.

2558
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:30,800
Chat.

2559
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,380
These like...

2560
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:36,580
It's just scary because everybody's not dying.

2561
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:38,160
That's like the scariest part.

2562
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,760
Nobody is fucking dying.

2563
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:42,540
So like everybody is just trying to...

2564
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:43,540
So like everybody is just trying to...

2565
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:46,100
Try to do their challenges and I'm just like...

2566
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,220
Please, please spare me.

2567
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,660
Please, please spare me.

2568
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:53,400
Please, please spare me.

2569
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:53,800
Please spare us.

2570
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,640
Let us go.

2571
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,480
This is NA Apex.

2572
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:58,820
This is NA Apex.

2573
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:00,740
What do you mean nobody is dying?

2574
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,620
We actually just weren't passing them.

2575
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,980
What do you mean no one's dying?

2576
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:06,680
What do you mean no one's dying?

2577
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:09,420
This is NA Apex.

2578
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:10,000
This is NA Apex.

2579
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,720
Please spare.

2580
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:14,860
Please spare.

2581
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:19,100
Three care package weapons and three red armor.

2582
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,360
Yeah, we weren't lucky enough to get the three red armor.

2583
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,940
Oh my god, somebody had one.

2584
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,560
Thank god that wasn't me.

2585
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,900
Guys, I told you we're improving.

2586
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,580
We didn't have one.

2587
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,240
Look at us.

2588
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:32,460
We're getting better and better.

2589
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:35,420
I think like there's some teams that don't even put their points.

2590
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,820
Because they're like, what's the point?

2591
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:37,380
They didn't...

2592
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,220
Oh my god.

2593
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,160
Not last.

2594
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,460
Not last.

2595
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,600
We're in the top five.

2596
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:48,920
Top five.

2597
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,400
That's what I like.

2598
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,440
These relaxing moments between rounds.

2599
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,100
Yeah.

2600
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:57,940
This is nice.

2601
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:00,420
It's nice.

2602
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,860
It's nice, but then like...

2603
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:06,260
Sometimes I wish it wasn't too long.

2604
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:06,820
You know?

2605
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:07,760
I just...

2606
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,960
Let me play the game!

2607
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:11,740
Let me play the game!

2608
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,620
I just wanna play.

2609
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:14,540
Please.

2610
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:18,140
Let me play.

2611
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:21,000
Oh my gosh.

2612
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,280
Like yesterday, I was so stressed the fuck out yesterday.

2613
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,720
That I mostly just...

2614
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,400
I was mostly just like sleeping.

2615
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:31,620
I was so fucking...

2616
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:33,960
I was just so fucked up, man.

2617
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,980
I was like...

2618
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:40,580
I didn't get any work done.

2619
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,060
And then like one of the things I had to do.

2620
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,560
That was due yesterday.

2621
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,360
I got like a message about it.

2622
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:48,320
They're like, um...

2623
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:51,100
Doki, we're sort of behind schedule.

2624
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,980
And I was like, fuck!

2625
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,080
I was like, I'm so sorry!

2626
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,720
I'm so sorry!

2627
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,960
I was so...

2628
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,080
I was so...

2629
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:02,460
No, I'm kidding.

2630
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,540
I was like, I was so busy yesterday.

2631
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,140
I...

2632
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,820
I was so tired.

2633
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:08,960
I just wanted to sleep.

2634
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:09,820
I didn't say that.

2635
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,680
I just said, I was so busy yesterday.

2636
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:13,700
With behind the scenes work.

2637
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:14,700
I'm so sorry.

2638
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,940
And then I like, I couldn't get it done today.

2639
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:18,880
I'm so sorry.

2640
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,040
I'm behind schedule.

2641
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:22,920
But they understand.

2642
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,800
And I sent the stuff that I had to do.

2643
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,400
Right before...

2644
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,480
Before I had to...

2645
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,500
Start my stream.

2646
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,320
I'm so sorry I'll never sleep again.

2647
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:38,980
Let's see.

2648
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,000
Uhhhh...

2649
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,760
Wait, each...

2650
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,660
And advances to the final...

2651
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:46,840
Oh!

2652
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,600
Wait, what?

2653
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,420
Wait!

2654
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,080
Wait, they changed the rules!

2655
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:56,920
If you win for most challenges per game, you advance to the finals.

2656
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,340
I thought it was overall.

2657
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,480
I thought it was overall.

2658
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,080
Yeah, we just have to get the most in one game.

2659
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,700
The top team that wins the challenges for that game gets to advance.

2660
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,280
Yeah!

2661
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,680
Yeah, I thought it was like...

2662
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,860
I thought it was overall, but it seems like...

2663
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:17,260
Well, it's actually too good for us for the three.

2664
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:19,200
At least that doesn't count.

2665
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,140
We just have to...

2666
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:24,140
So if you win just one of them, you can go to the finals.

2667
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:25,520
Yeah.

2668
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,220
So we gotta...

2669
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:31,980
We gotta start getting some of these actual fighting ones.

2670
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,180
The challenges.

2671
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,500
Yeah, we need to fight somebody.

2672
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,900
Yeah, Xenox, you need to...

2673
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,400
Actually, it was physically impossible to fight people.

2674
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:41,980
I had four set up bullets.

2675
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I had four set up bullets and no attack wounds.

2676
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:44,860
And no meds.

2677
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,500
And I had to fight us two to get the fighting one.

2678
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:48,000
It was hard.

2679
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:49,580
I know, I felt so bad.

2680
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:51,120
Like, you were fiending for that lobalt.

2681
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,580
And I was like, no, it's not ready.

2682
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,360
We're the babies here.

2683
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,360
You're supposed to carry us.

2684
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:58,760
I need to not do the no-attachment ones.

2685
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,920
Yeah, exactly.

2686
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:03,640
I was hoping to just get a care package gun.

2687
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,600
Do you want to do the no-attachments one, Doki?

2688
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:06,340
Wait, me?

2689
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,860
Yeah, I feel like you haven't been nerfed enough yet.

2690
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:11,720
But you're on the P20, though.

2691
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,140
So...

2692
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,960
Yeah, but my other gun...

2693
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,040
doesn't get attachments either.

2694
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,300
I don't know.

2695
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,400
That plus 90 is rough.

2696
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,860
Oh, but you can just run the vault.

2697
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,620
You don't need attachments on the vault.

2698
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:26,420
It's so easy.

2699
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:28,240
I don't know, I think you need to be nerfed a little bit.

2700
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,420
to like join the group.

2701
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,320
I mean, I am nerfed.

2702
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:32,200
I'm making the heart.

2703
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,720
The heart is a very hard thing to do.

2704
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,340
Like, I can't loot when I'm making the heart.

2705
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,040
That's practically a nerf.

2706
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:42,400
Right there.

2707
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2708
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:52,060
I mean, all in all, this is like Senox's decision.

2709
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,320
Why is it all up to me?

2710
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,120
Why am I the leader?

2711
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,140
Because you're the IGL.

2712
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,040
I just want to be the content creator.

2713
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,280
I'm the content creator!

2714
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:03,460
I too am a content creator.

2715
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

2716
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,040
What do you mean?

2717
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,520
Okay, okay.

2718
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:12,480
I'm pretty sure I'm the more content creator compared to you.

2719
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:13,380
I'm pretty sure.

2720
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:15,200
I'm pretty sure.

2721
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:20,320
If we look at stats here regarding hours streamed on Apex.

2722
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:25,880
I just started two weeks ago, so I have the least hours streamed for Apex.

2723
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,940
I don't stream Apex.

2724
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:31,840
I'm a content creator.

2725
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,320
I just don't stream at all.

2726
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,800
I create content, but like I don't put it out.

2727
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,580
You literally have a liquipedia!

2728
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,380
That invalidates everything you say!

2729
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,520
I couldn't even get a liquipedia!

2730
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:43,700
Anybody can get one of those.

2731
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:44,660
Anybody can get one of those.

2732
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:45,040
No!

2733
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:50,960
I tried to get one and they deleted my liquipedia because my tournaments are not official enough.

2734
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:57,860
They deleted my liquipedia, so I know that's a lie.

2735
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:04,000
They're like, your tournaments are too much on content creation!

2736
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,240
And not pro enough!

2737
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:12,740
Nobody can outsmart me!

2738
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,680
Weird flex!

2739
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,220
It's true!

2740
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,800
People try to make me a liquipedia!

2741
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:24,780
It's got a nice little zone.

2742
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,320
They deleted it!

2743
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:27,560
Yeah.

2744
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,620
I just got here.

2745
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:35,320
Did we win?

2746
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,060
Maybe like mentally.

2747
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:38,140
I think we won.

2748
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:47,860
We won the mental battle!

2749
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:49,760
That's all that matters!

2750
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,200
It doesn't matter!

2751
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,900
It doesn't...

2752
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,160
The other things don't matter!

2753
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,940
We won the mental battle!

2754
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:05,300
Alright.

2755
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,060
Remember to pick your legends this time!

2756
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:08,800
Oh shit.

2757
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:09,340
Caustic.

2758
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:17,430
Oh my god.

2759
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:18,050
Good call.

2760
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:26,500
Nice.

2761
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,820
We got one point already!

2762
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,660
We did it!

2763
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:32,780
Nice.

2764
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,180
Our one point.

2765
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:35,980
Go us!

2766
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:39,220
Alright, we got this!

2767
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,060
Beacon?

2768
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,640
No beacon?

2769
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,420
We don't need beacon.

2770
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,160
That's fine.

2771
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:48,760
One person epi, one person...

2772
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:49,860
I'll do the tunnel ops in case.

2773
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,000
Just be careful epi.

2774
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,520
Actually no, you should be good.

2775
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:54,300
I don't think the comments...

2776
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:55,620
I'm gonna go to epi then.

2777
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,360
Dude up!

2778
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,900
Meet up in survey.

2779
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:02,840
Alright.

2780
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:04,800
So I don't gotta move?

2781
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:05,400
Perfect?

2782
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:06,620
Yeah, you get to stay there.

2783
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,980
I mean, if you wanna swap, I don't mind.

2784
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,220
I'm gonna turn this into a home over here.

2785
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,920
You know, I'm free to swap with you.

2786
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,480
Out of the goodness of my heart.

2787
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:16,640
I'm gonna be homesteading.

2788
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:20,340
You'll find me churning butter by the time you guys get here.

2789
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,000
Okay, I hope I don't die.

2790
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:23,700
Don't die.

2791
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,960
That's all I hope for.

2792
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,120
You'll be fine.

2793
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:28,200
Just talk to him nicely.

2794
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:31,320
Yo, I'm getting ratted.

2795
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:32,320
This guy is a freak.

2796
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,640
Alright, guess I'm coming to save the epi.

2797
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,320
Wait, you already lost your home?

2798
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:38,900
What happened?

2799
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,240
The skyhook guy landed on me.

2800
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,380
And I didn't get a gun.

2801
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,400
Then fight him!

2802
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:45,520
Why are you scared?

2803
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:49,440
I don't have a blaster.

2804
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,040
I don't have a gun.

2805
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,880
Oh, you got the gun first.

2806
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,440
Damn, no beacon.

2807
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,020
Sucks.

2808
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,700
I hope you guys grab all the shield cells.

2809
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,700
Oh yeah, I have three nades on me right now.

2810
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,560
I only have... I have three on me.

2811
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:07,780
And also a blue backpack.

2812
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:09,980
We can just stack nades and then drop them all to one person.

2813
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:10,580
Yeah.

2814
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,280
That's the plan.

2815
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,400
I'm gonna go up.

2816
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:17,720
See if there's anything.

2817
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:18,720
Wait, they're pushing us.

2818
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:19,320
They're inting us.

2819
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:20,200
Wait, what?

2820
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:21,200
Already?

2821
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:24,360
I think so.

2822
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:27,800
Trying to come link with you.

2823
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:29,040
He's sitting in the building.

2824
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:30,080
Wait, what is this guy doing?

2825
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,140
Do I come over or leave?

2826
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:33,280
Yeah, you should come over.

2827
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:35,280
I'm heading over now.

2828
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:36,860
Oh my god.

2829
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,500
I have no shield cells.

2830
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,500
I'm flying on the rock.

2831
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:41,900
They're walking up.

2832
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:43,640
I'm heading over right now.

2833
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:47,360
I don't know if I'm getting shot or what.

2834
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:48,800
I'm popping surges.

2835
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:51,340
Where are they?

2836
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:52,820
I only see Gibby right now.

2837
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,400
He was on the building.

2838
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:56,460
I see him.

2839
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:57,060
They're running up.

2840
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:58,640
I'm popping surges.

2841
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:00,260
I saw one.

2842
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:00,400
Yeah.

2843
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:02,800
I can't see you.

2844
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,480
No LOS there.

2845
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,080
Wait, what is this guy doing?

2846
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,520
He's actually just trolling and playing for fun.

2847
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:08,420
Wait, what?

2848
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,800
Are we good?

2849
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,180
Yeah, we're good.

2850
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:15,100
Anyone have a blue bag?

2851
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,340
I have a blue bag.

2852
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:16,580
Yeah.

2853
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,660
I need to go craft a boat.

2854
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,080
I have a Valkyr.

2855
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,700
Can you guys give me your shield cells?

2856
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:23,700
I'm gonna make a heart now.

2857
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,040
I have zero.

2858
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,500
I only have four.

2859
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:29,380
Alright, I'm gonna try and do this.

2860
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,780
Does this look like a heart?

2861
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:33,700
Does this look like a heart?

2862
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:34,480
Okay.

2863
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:41,930
I will attempt this part.

2864
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:42,110
I will attempt this part.

2865
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:43,430
Let's play for...

2866
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:45,590
Let's go grab this Evo in the tunnel.

2867
01:39:45,710 --> 01:39:47,110
And then let's hit the balloon and go for the vault.

2868
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:49,970
We have to play slow anyways.

2869
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:51,050
We didn't get bacon unfortunately.

2870
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:51,710
Alright.

2871
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:52,770
Here's four.

2872
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:56,810
This can be a heart.

2873
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:58,390
It is!

2874
01:39:58,710 --> 01:39:59,530
It looks like a heart!

2875
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:02,170
It does.

2876
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:02,590
Yes!

2877
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:03,490
Yes!

2878
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:03,910
Look!

2879
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:06,450
Look at that!

2880
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:11,070
Okay, I need, I need, I need Senox to come over your screen.

2881
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:12,370
It looks like a heart!

2882
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:14,230
If it looks like it, it's fine.

2883
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:15,590
It doesn't have to be perfect.

2884
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:16,170
It is!

2885
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:16,950
Okay, there you go.

2886
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:17,450
We did it.

2887
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:18,970
That's a heart enough.

2888
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:21,450
Let's go up here.

2889
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:23,030
And hit the Evo.

2890
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:24,390
And then we're gonna go for the vault.

2891
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:25,570
I can vault call back there.

2892
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:28,270
Do we have enough nades to do the nade bag thing?

2893
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:29,650
I have three right now.

2894
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:30,450
I have three.

2895
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:34,150
Let's just all hold each other.

2896
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:35,910
Like nades until we have enough.

2897
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:37,330
So one person isn't scuffed.

2898
01:40:37,390 --> 01:40:38,150
Wait, you have nine on you?

2899
01:40:38,230 --> 01:40:38,690
We have enough.

2900
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:38,990
Yeah.

2901
01:40:39,730 --> 01:40:41,030
Three, six, nine is a full bag?

2902
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:41,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2903
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:43,950
We'll do it up here on the balloon.

2904
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:46,230
I'll give you the nades and then go grab the Evo and come back.

2905
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:47,190
Wait.

2906
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:49,070
They're riding in here.

2907
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:50,290
What are these guys doing?

2908
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:52,270
Well then I guess we don't do that.

2909
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:53,550
They're so cringe.

2910
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,750
Here, just do it under here I guess.

2911
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:57,790
I'm gonna drop you all the nades and then go.

2912
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:00,590
Alright, I'm gonna drop all of this in.

2913
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:04,990
Don't take my stuff please.

2914
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:06,750
He's walking up, he's walking up.

2915
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:08,970
I'm slowing down.

2916
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:11,170
Okay, if he's walking up I can't do this anymore.

2917
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,110
He took my nades!

2918
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:16,130
Oh, they're above us.

2919
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:17,450
Yeah, I threw my nades away.

2920
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:18,590
Can you come back to me with bubble or no?

2921
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:19,290
Okay.

2922
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,750
So we left a bunch of nades on that ground.

2923
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:26,430
I picked up one of them.

2924
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:28,270
I picked up... I have four.

2925
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:29,290
Is it a solo Gibby?

2926
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:29,590
It's not.

2927
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,070
Almost cracked Gibby.

2928
01:41:32,030 --> 01:41:32,770
Gibby's one, Gibby's one.

2929
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:33,350
I have to heal.

2930
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:34,970
Knock Gibby, knock Gibby.

2931
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:36,010
Oh nice, you got the knock.

2932
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:36,530
They're gonna rez.

2933
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:38,670
Let's just back up, I don't have loot.

2934
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:39,670
Let's just go to the vault.

2935
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:41,790
Come to me and I'm gonna valk behind this building.

2936
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:44,290
Wait, was that one of the challenges?

2937
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:44,850
The knock?

2938
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:46,570
Wait, there's a new team on the front.

2939
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:47,090
Can we get in the building?

2940
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:49,330
They're trying to port.

2941
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:50,110
They're trying to get in the building.

2942
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:51,170
He Q'd out.

2943
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:51,470
He Q'd out.

2944
01:41:54,370 --> 01:41:55,610
We're gonna try to re-valk.

2945
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:56,270
We gotta get out of here.

2946
01:41:56,370 --> 01:41:56,590
Come to me.

2947
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:57,470
We're here.

2948
01:41:58,590 --> 01:41:59,090
Outside, outside.

2949
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:03,630
Yay!

2950
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:08,750
We're gonna fly front and go to the skyhook vault.

2951
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:10,230
We have to play for evil harvesters.

2952
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:13,910
Alright, pick me a longbow or a scythe.

2953
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:14,110
I'm gonna go for the sentinel.

2954
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,030
I guess I can pick up a different gun.

2955
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:15,530
Alright.

2956
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:21,210
Do we have one evil harvester, right?

2957
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:22,250
We don't have any.

2958
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:22,510
Yeah, we do.

2959
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:23,370
I got one.

2960
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:23,830
I got one.

2961
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:27,110
Let's hit this vault and get this one back here.

2962
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:28,330
We can play for red armor if we get the vault.

2963
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:29,430
Alright.

2964
01:42:29,930 --> 01:42:31,170
I'm dropping a gold lightmaker.

2965
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:33,130
I'm gonna say we can find more names.

2966
01:42:33,410 --> 01:42:35,110
They're just gonna keep WKing as we stay here.

2967
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:39,030
It might be a team that already got the challenges, so they're just playing for kills.

2968
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:39,950
Like they could go...

2969
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:40,450
Ready?

2970
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:41,350
Is 20 squads up?

2971
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:42,190
There's no way.

2972
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:43,270
Oh, no.

2973
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:46,230
Like if you win one of the games, you don't...

2974
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:46,990
Oh, you can't win twice.

2975
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:48,530
Yeah, they're just playing to kill people.

2976
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:51,590
Because they advanced to the finals already.

2977
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:53,370
Yeah.

2978
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:56,510
They just get to relax.

2979
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:57,670
Tell me that's not crest.

2980
01:42:58,010 --> 01:43:01,870
That guy's gonna get a talking to after this game if that's crest.

2981
01:43:02,290 --> 01:43:02,810
Oh, yeah?

2982
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:04,570
Gold does here.

2983
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:05,830
Huge.

2984
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:09,510
Remember no attachments, Mimi.

2985
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:11,730
Oh, wait.

2986
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:11,970
Whoa!

2987
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:12,930
No attachments.

2988
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:13,570
Just throw it out.

2989
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:14,770
If you haven't used it yet.

2990
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:16,270
I haven't used it.

2991
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:19,330
Be careful.

2992
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:20,650
Can we get on this roof?

2993
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:21,510
They might land on us.

2994
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:22,190
We might have to fight them here.

2995
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:22,650
I'm gonna fly roof.

2996
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:24,350
We're good.

2997
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:24,590
We're good.

2998
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:24,810
We're good.

2999
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:26,570
How many nades do you guys have?

3000
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:27,390
I only have four.

3001
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:27,830
I have two.

3002
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:29,710
I have six, seven, eight.

3003
01:43:29,810 --> 01:43:30,550
Okay, we need two.

3004
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:35,030
Just scrap loot.

3005
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:36,530
And we're gonna play for the evos and stuff.

3006
01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:38,990
Wait, there's an evil hardy, sir.

3007
01:43:38,990 --> 01:43:39,010
I'm gonna grab that.

3008
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,570
I need a Valk ult two more times.

3009
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:44,670
I only popped it once so far.

3010
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:46,110
I'm gonna grab this evil harvester.

3011
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:50,010
Grab the evil harvester and then...

3012
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:52,290
Are you...

3013
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:54,210
Wait, so I'm the one that's doing no attachments.

3014
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:54,850
I'm sorry.

3015
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:56,210
Yeah, you're the one with no attachments.

3016
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:58,390
Can you...

3017
01:43:58,390 --> 01:43:59,190
Can you hit beacon?

3018
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:01,250
Yeah, I can.

3019
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:03,070
I'm gonna run over now.

3020
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:05,230
I just wanna see if I can find some nades.

3021
01:44:05,550 --> 01:44:06,550
I haven't seen any.

3022
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,560
I have two right now.

3023
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,320
I have four.

3024
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:14,800
We have a minute.

3025
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:15,800
We're gonna hit beacon and get going.

3026
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:18,380
We need one more evil harvester.

3027
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,960
We need six more nades.

3028
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,360
I'm gonna peek in the countdown.

3029
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,500
There's a guy above us.

3030
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:29,580
We're gonna Valk ult.

3031
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:31,720
We can come back here.

3032
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:33,280
I have 5%.

3033
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,400
Do we have enough nades to do the nade one quick?

3034
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:36,760
No, no.

3035
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,380
We need six.

3036
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:38,100
Oh, you have five?

3037
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:39,460
I have five now.

3038
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:42,080
Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

3039
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:42,720
We need three.

3040
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:43,240
We need three more.

3041
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,360
I have two.

3042
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:46,240
There's another one up here.

3043
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:47,960
So we need two more.

3044
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,160
I can grab one right now.

3045
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,480
I'm gonna grab this one.

3046
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:56,600
Let's try to do it in this building so we can Valk ult and actually pull the game.

3047
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,660
We need two more nades and we should be good.

3048
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:02,420
We need two more nades and we should be good.

3049
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:04,080
I just want another sniper.

3050
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:10,640
No nades.

3051
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:10,960
No nades.

3052
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:13,320
Nope.

3053
01:45:14,020 --> 01:45:14,460
Alright, whatever.

3054
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:15,460
Let's Valk ult here.

3055
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,600
I'm not even sure it's gonna be open.

3056
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:19,400
There's still 19 teams.

3057
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:21,390
Let's play for...

3058
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:23,940
We might just play for the tracks.

3059
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:26,500
I don't know if we can get into Mirage.

3060
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,460
Go last slide for now.

3061
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:29,940
We can hit this evil harvester and get our third one.

3062
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:30,900
There's a guy on it.

3063
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:31,780
There's a guy there.

3064
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:32,420
There's a team.

3065
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:33,000
Does he have teammates?

3066
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3067
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,460
There's a team in the left side.

3068
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:39,800
Go countdown.

3069
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:40,160
Go countdown.

3070
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:45,080
Do we have any health exiles?

3071
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:46,100
Nope, no.

3072
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,580
My last syringe.

3073
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:50,220
Use that up now.

3074
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:51,860
Another nade right here.

3075
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:52,420
Can you hold this?

3076
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:54,200
That means we need one more.

3077
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:54,760
Yeah, I can hold it.

3078
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:55,240
I can hold it.

3079
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,940
Let's look for one more and then get going.

3080
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:00,220
Just need one more.

3081
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:08,410
I'm gonna scout.

3082
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:09,550
Do we see anybody Mirage?

3083
01:46:10,590 --> 01:46:12,570
I'm gonna look around and see if we can find one more nade.

3084
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:14,630
We might look to play a top Mirage if we can.

3085
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:19,070
Let's get going.

3086
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:20,170
Uh oh, there's no nades in here.

3087
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:22,530
Let's get going.

3088
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:24,150
We're on bridge.

3089
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:27,130
I'm gonna scout Pound and Mirage.

3090
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:28,470
Was that our third Valkal?

3091
01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:30,170
No, we need one more.

3092
01:46:30,730 --> 01:46:32,130
There's a caustic trap in this valley.

3093
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:32,870
Watch out.

3094
01:46:33,090 --> 01:46:33,710
There's nades here?

3095
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:34,930
There's nades?

3096
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:35,430
Then we have it.

3097
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:35,830
We have enough nades.

3098
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:37,090
I'm dropping all my nades.

3099
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:38,250
I just dropped all your nades there and I'll just do it.

3100
01:46:39,130 --> 01:46:40,370
I'm picking up white meds.

3101
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:43,370
They flew in.

3102
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,410
I didn't even see one to Mirage.

3103
01:46:44,410 --> 01:46:44,930
Oh, they dropped it.

3104
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:46,230
On the balcony.

3105
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:48,250
I have white meds.

3106
01:46:48,730 --> 01:46:50,070
Do all the nades on these bodies.

3107
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:51,790
We're gonna run out.

3108
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:52,690
I'm dropping my nades.

3109
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:56,590
I got it!

3110
01:46:56,650 --> 01:46:56,930
Yay!

3111
01:46:57,950 --> 01:46:58,830
You can pick up all your loot.

3112
01:46:59,030 --> 01:47:00,790
Do you need white meds?

3113
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:02,010
I'm dropping a med kit and four surges.

3114
01:47:02,230 --> 01:47:02,470
I have med kits.

3115
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:05,870
We might slide down and grab this.

3116
01:47:06,370 --> 01:47:07,170
And then try to play.

3117
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:07,890
We're gonna have to play slow.

3118
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:08,910
Alright.

3119
01:47:11,110 --> 01:47:12,690
Is there anyone in graveyard in front of us?

3120
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:13,590
I don't think so.

3121
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:14,070
There's a harvester right there.

3122
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:15,830
Yeah, let's play for this fence right here.

3123
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:16,770
I'll grab the Evo.

3124
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:17,670
We can just go straight to the fence.

3125
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:19,250
There's a team top Mirage there so be careful.

3126
01:47:19,370 --> 01:47:19,970
Might beam you.

3127
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:22,710
Oh yeah, they're looking.

3128
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:24,770
Bubble it if you have to.

3129
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:27,290
We finished our... do you have any surges?

3130
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:28,630
I only have med kits.

3131
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:31,770
I'm dropping a Phoenix if you don't pop that.

3132
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:33,430
Careful, they might nade someone.

3133
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:34,190
We're gonna have to bubble here.

3134
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:34,870
They're right above us.

3135
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:36,210
I'm just gonna med kit then.

3136
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:39,870
We're gonna use our third valkal to get in.

3137
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:40,250
Okay.

3138
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:42,130
Do you want to bubble for it?

3139
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:43,210
This is my last meds by the way.

3140
01:47:44,410 --> 01:47:45,070
I can give you a couple of shield heals.

3141
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:45,330
Here you go.

3142
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:48,650
I can give you some.

3143
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:49,990
What kind of heals do you need?

3144
01:47:50,110 --> 01:47:51,470
I just need syringes.

3145
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:52,270
I don't have any...

3146
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:53,490
I drop three.

3147
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:55,050
Wait, what?

3148
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:57,850
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.

3149
01:47:59,450 --> 01:48:00,610
Give me ult in time.

3150
01:48:00,790 --> 01:48:01,130
I ulted in time.

3151
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:04,630
I'm playing back here.

3152
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,330
We played a kill this time.

3153
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:09,470
Can you maybe crawl to the back of this?

3154
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:09,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3155
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:11,770
Oh, I can't.

3156
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:13,970
This ult is not your ult?

3157
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:15,990
Just keep crawling.

3158
01:48:16,030 --> 01:48:16,570
We can play rez.

3159
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:17,050
We can play rez.

3160
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:20,330
20 seconds.

3161
01:48:20,330 --> 01:48:22,630
Was it just the rat?

3162
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:24,010
I don't know.

3163
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:25,190
One died.

3164
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:27,530
Popping a bat.

3165
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:28,290
Can you play rez?

3166
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:31,610
Just play rez.

3167
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:33,270
We have to rez and valk ult out.

3168
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,190
I'm gonna drop my golds.

3169
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:36,090
She should get 50.

3170
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:36,650
She should get 50.

3171
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:39,850
Here, I'm dropping gold rez.

3172
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:40,770
I'm dropping gold rez.

3173
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:43,170
Oh, they snatched that shit.

3174
01:48:43,330 --> 01:48:43,750
Wait, what?

3175
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:44,630
Loba snatched it.

3176
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:47,250
Oh my god.

3177
01:48:49,490 --> 01:48:51,550
That is so unfortunate.

3178
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:53,430
I might be dead to the zone.

3179
01:48:55,010 --> 01:48:55,730
Oh, okay.

3180
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:56,370
You survived.

3181
01:48:56,710 --> 01:48:57,730
I'll bub as soon as we drop.

3182
01:48:58,330 --> 01:48:59,010
If we need to.

3183
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:01,890
We have to just fly far and we might drop down into lava.

3184
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:02,630
I think I might just die.

3185
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,870
Can you bubble instantly?

3186
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:10,430
Come on, bitch.

3187
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:11,250
I'm phoenixing.

3188
01:49:11,310 --> 01:49:13,970
We play this platform and we might have to drop down into lava.

3189
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:15,650
Third harvester in front.

3190
01:49:15,910 --> 01:49:16,710
I don't have any.

3191
01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:17,470
Okay.

3192
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:21,730
Slide forward and then we have to look at our backs.

3193
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:22,630
Slide forward and look behind us.

3194
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:24,810
Loba ult.

3195
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:26,730
And we gotta look behind us.

3196
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:29,030
Do any of you guys have...

3197
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:31,370
Behind, behind, behind.

3198
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:32,390
In the corner, 120.

3199
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:35,090
I can get it.

3200
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:37,410
I'm just gonna med kit.

3201
01:49:38,830 --> 01:49:40,410
How long on the next bubble?

3202
01:49:41,470 --> 01:49:42,110
10 seconds.

3203
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:44,870
We're gonna swing wide and bubble and kill the loba on the cart.

3204
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:46,930
We're gonna swing wide and bubble and kill the loba on the cart.

3205
01:49:47,290 --> 01:49:48,130
I might need this.

3206
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:49,930
3, 2...

3207
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:51,210
Let's go, let's go.

3208
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:57,620
1, 1, 1.

3209
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,440
Oh, he fucked up.

3210
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:58,500
What?

3211
01:49:59,400 --> 01:49:59,720
Nice.

3212
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:01,000
Looted and we gotta go back.

3213
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,000
He's the one that took the...

3214
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,360
She's the one that took that shit.

3215
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:07,180
I got it here.

3216
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:08,440
Oh, you got it already?

3217
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:09,200
I'm shooting at you.

3218
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,180
Any ulti cells?

3219
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:10,860
No.

3220
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,480
I can just give this.

3221
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:14,100
Do we have any bats?

3222
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:16,160
Oh my gosh, what am I getting shot at?

3223
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,140
I have a bat.

3224
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:17,840
I dropped my bat.

3225
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:20,280
I'm dropping some cells on the ground.

3226
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:21,540
I'm just looking for roots.

3227
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:24,740
Wait, I can regen my HP over.

3228
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:25,640
There's a full team in here.

3229
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,960
Wait, did you ever knock yourself with the frag?

3230
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,100
No, we haven't.

3231
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:34,740
Do you want to do it right now?

3232
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,020
Oh my god.

3233
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:36,920
Here's a frag.

3234
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:37,760
Here's a regular frag.

3235
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:40,480
I'm gonna do it.

3236
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:41,640
Take the gold res and res me with it.

3237
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:42,720
Yeah, you should do it.

3238
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:48,270
Oh my god, I'm almost gone.

3239
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:49,950
The building.

3240
01:50:50,090 --> 01:50:50,190
The building.

3241
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:52,070
Oh no.

3242
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:52,650
Oh my god.

3243
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:54,990
Wait, we actually might have just...

3244
01:50:54,990 --> 01:50:55,890
We might have just threw them.

3245
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:57,110
We have to slide up to their fence, okay?

3246
01:50:57,190 --> 01:50:58,290
We have to slide up to their fence, okay?

3247
01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:00,250
Slide to the fence.

3248
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:00,730
Slide to the fence.

3249
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:01,150
Slide to the fence.

3250
01:51:01,230 --> 01:51:02,010
They're right close.

3251
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:02,390
They're right close.

3252
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:05,410
We're playing slow.

3253
01:51:05,430 --> 01:51:05,950
We're gonna play slow.

3254
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,730
No, he couldn't.

3255
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:07,290
I have gold res.

3256
01:51:07,290 --> 01:51:08,150
You have gold res.

3257
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:08,810
No, I'm dead.

3258
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:10,030
I never... You gave me gold.

3259
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:10,730
That's fine.

3260
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:11,990
They're on you.

3261
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:16,430
That was too thick.

3262
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:17,130
I don't even think we live.

3263
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:17,690
I'm not gonna lie.

3264
01:51:17,850 --> 01:51:18,750
We were too thick.

3265
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:28,050
Oh my god.

3266
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:29,870
Bad idea.

3267
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:30,830
To drop.

3268
01:51:32,690 --> 01:51:33,250
It's okay.

3269
01:51:33,330 --> 01:51:33,970
I can watch.

3270
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:36,490
For like a couple of seconds.

3271
01:51:39,370 --> 01:51:40,030
It's okay.

3272
01:51:40,030 --> 01:51:41,430
How many times did we Vel'Koz?

3273
01:51:42,830 --> 01:51:44,330
I think that was...

3274
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:45,050
That was our third.

3275
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:45,970
That was our third.

3276
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:46,190
Yeah.

3277
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:47,990
That was our third.

3278
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:48,710
We should be fine.

3279
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:50,750
I'm gonna play for a longbow knock and a finisher, I think.

3280
01:51:54,150 --> 01:51:55,210
That was too thick.

3281
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:03,020
There's so many people.

3282
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:10,240
Oh my gosh.

3283
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:11,220
I just realized...

3284
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:13,600
Hang on.

3285
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:15,680
Do you have enough shields?

3286
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:16,380
Oh, you do.

3287
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:19,780
Oh my god.

3288
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:31,940
Do you have enough meds for this?

3289
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:33,560
No.

3290
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:34,200
I'm probably dead.

3291
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,240
I'm out of shield deals.

3292
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:36,500
Wait.

3293
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:37,300
Oh my god.

3294
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:38,660
I think there's a rock I can sit by.

3295
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:39,880
I might just Vel'Koz and go for that.

3296
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:40,880
Oh.

3297
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:43,520
Let's see if you make it.

3298
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:45,300
I mean...

3299
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,060
Surely I'm dead if I just stay here.

3300
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:47,580
I'm out of meds.

3301
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,160
That's true.

3302
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:48,460
Yeah.

3303
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:48,980
You might as well.

3304
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:50,320
This is your last... your Hail Mary.

3305
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:55,280
Oh my god.

3306
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:55,600
It's in.

3307
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:57,360
Holy fuck.

3308
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:57,560
It's in.

3309
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,020
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3310
01:52:59,020 --> 01:52:59,260
Please.

3311
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,560
You barely won sniper shot.

3312
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:04,700
No.

3313
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:08,600
No.

3314
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:10,920
Oh my god.

3315
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:12,100
You're not in though.

3316
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,380
I think I can climb up a little bit.

3317
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:15,440
I'm out of meds, so...

3318
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:15,800
I'm gonna wait.

3319
01:53:15,820 --> 01:53:16,600
I'm gonna wait till the last second.

3320
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:18,260
Alright.

3321
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:19,820
We gotta cheese the longbow knock.

3322
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,920
We gotta cheese the longbow knock.

3323
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:22,220
OMG.

3324
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:24,920
Oh my god.

3325
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:26,940
I can't believe this is happening.

3326
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:30,180
You're like... you're like one shot away from dying.

3327
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:33,560
There's...

3328
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:35,040
Oh no!

3329
01:53:38,290 --> 01:53:40,050
I just hope no one looks at you.

3330
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:40,370
Oh my gosh.

3331
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:41,430
Do you have any heals?

3332
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:43,190
No, I'm fully out.

3333
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:44,590
No!

3334
01:53:44,590 --> 01:53:45,210
What was that?

3335
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:50,410
What was that?

3336
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:52,990
What was that?

3337
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:53,710
What was that?

3338
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:54,170
Zeroed them.

3339
01:53:55,710 --> 01:53:56,750
What was that?

3340
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:57,710
Oh my god.

3341
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:58,930
Bro, it's oof down there.

3342
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:01,330
I thought I could boost her up, but it's oof and you can't boost her.

3343
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:01,710
Oh my god.

3344
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:05,930
One...

3345
01:54:07,810 --> 01:54:08,530
Two... three...

3346
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:11,630
Four...

3347
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:16,150
That's so joe, babe.

3348
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:17,450
Five...

3349
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:18,610
Seven...

3350
01:54:21,090 --> 01:54:22,290
Eight... I didn't know that was oof.

3351
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:22,950
Honestly, that sucks.

3352
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:24,670
Nine...

3353
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:25,910
Did we get nine again?

3354
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:26,530
We got nine.

3355
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:30,650
Actually, I had to recount because we actually got ten.

3356
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:31,450
I forgot to count.

3357
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:32,750
We didn't use a survival item.

3358
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:33,570
Oh, yeah, ten.

3359
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:36,650
So it was actually ten last game, so I had to recount to make sure.

3360
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:37,290
Alright.

3361
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:39,930
Someone fact check me for this one?

3362
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:41,770
What number you guys have?

3363
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:43,990
Alright, I'll put the picture up here.

3364
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:44,890
I didn't like it.

3365
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:48,370
I don't even think there's any... what are the challenges?

3366
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:49,490
Could I have done that game?

3367
01:54:49,530 --> 01:54:50,230
Just the longbow knock?

3368
01:54:50,230 --> 01:54:50,970
Could I have knocked somebody?

3369
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:53,210
Yeah, the longbow knock...

3370
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:55,470
Let's see...

3371
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:57,090
We didn't have our comp last game, right?

3372
01:54:57,230 --> 01:54:57,770
Or did we?

3373
01:54:57,910 --> 01:54:58,550
No, we didn't.

3374
01:54:58,570 --> 01:54:59,070
We didn't.

3375
01:54:59,170 --> 01:54:59,770
We did this game.

3376
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:01,570
Okay, so we got that.

3377
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:05,930
I mean, you could have got three thousand just to keep farming.

3378
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:07,750
Yeah, just a little two thousand damage.

3379
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:08,990
Just a little farming.

3380
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:18,840
You could have got the knock opponent off evac tower.

3381
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:22,320
One player drops a 2k damage game.

3382
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:25,920
Get ten kills or more as a team.

3383
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:26,780
And you're the team.

3384
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:32,560
Oh my god.

3385
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:38,360
Okay, we're consistent.

3386
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:39,800
That's...

3387
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,220
We're improving!

3388
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,000
It wasn't nine?

3389
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:43,640
I thought it was ten.

3390
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,080
I'm asking you guys what this game was.

3391
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:47,320
Let me look at it.

3392
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:48,300
Where's the board?

3393
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,980
Alright, I'll look up too.

3394
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:51,000
I thought we got ten.

3395
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:51,740
I got it.

3396
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:52,100
Let me look.

3397
01:55:52,740 --> 01:56:09,440
We got FOV, Harvesters, Backpack, Valkyrie... wait, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

3398
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:12,700
We got ten.

3399
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:13,500
I think.

3400
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,460
That's what I came up with too.

3401
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:28,760
FOV one, Harvesters two, Backpack three, Comp four, Tri-Drivel five, Nade six, Survival item seven, No Attachments eight, Alt nine.

3402
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:31,840
Am I missing one?

3403
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:32,980
Oh, and the heart ten.

3404
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:33,740
Yeah.

3405
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:34,560
Ten.

3406
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:35,560
My heart.

3407
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:36,640
It was the heart.

3408
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:37,420
Guys.

3409
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,580
I posted ten in our chat.

3410
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:46,720
Only one other person so far got ten.

3411
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:47,280
I don't know.

3412
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,840
I feel like somebody's gonna have like twelve or fourteen or something.

3413
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:49,960
Eleven.

3414
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:51,140
Somebody should, realistically.

3415
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:53,160
Yeah, like the last game someone got fourteen.

3416
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:59,160
So I feel like someone must have got fourteen or something.

3417
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:04,600
Currently it's a tiebreaker.

3418
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:13,470
I wonder how they did the game one.

3419
01:57:13,730 --> 01:57:16,730
Cause there was like a three-way tiebreaker or something, right?

3420
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:21,190
I think they did I think they just gave it to whoever won the game or was closest to winning.

3421
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:22,170
The closest to winning?

3422
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:23,550
What's our placement?

3423
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:28,810
Um, we got We got We got Oh nevermind.

3424
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:29,430
Someone got eleven.

3425
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:31,430
Wait, it doesn't matter.

3426
01:57:31,850 --> 01:57:33,270
Someone already got eleven.

3427
01:57:35,330 --> 01:57:35,810
Damn.

3428
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:41,910
Nooo.

3429
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:46,930
What if I just edit twelve?

3430
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:55,090
I guess new map.

3431
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:55,990
New map time.

3432
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:57,690
Hopefully a new card.

3433
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:01,370
Tempo said it's new cards.

3434
01:58:01,570 --> 01:58:01,930
Oh, it's up.

3435
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:02,450
Oh, it's up.

3436
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:04,030
Where?

3437
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:06,010
It's up.

3438
01:58:07,450 --> 01:58:08,170
I look.

3439
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:10,030
One red armor.

3440
01:58:10,170 --> 01:58:11,090
Oh my god, it's easier!

3441
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:12,150
I love it!

3442
01:58:12,970 --> 01:58:14,470
Knock yourself with a thermite?

3443
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:16,410
Okay, we can do the PVE for sure.

3444
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:17,890
Is there a comp?

3445
01:58:18,650 --> 01:58:19,710
Do a finisher.

3446
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:20,950
I'm gonna look there right now.

3447
01:58:20,990 --> 01:58:24,490
We need a caustic ult knock and we need get a knock with valk rockets.

3448
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:26,950
300 damage with EMP.

3449
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:28,190
And we need watson.

3450
01:58:28,850 --> 01:58:29,350
Crypto, caustic.

3451
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:33,230
Crypto, caustic, and watson.

3452
01:58:34,630 --> 01:58:35,370
Or valk.

3453
01:58:35,710 --> 01:58:36,190
I'm gonna go with the watson one.

3454
01:58:37,190 --> 01:58:39,430
Watson is... draw a heart with watson fence.

3455
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:40,830
We can just play crypto caustic.

3456
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:42,270
That's so easy!

3457
01:58:42,410 --> 01:58:43,270
I can do that again!

3458
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:46,890
And then there's rave 2.

3459
01:58:47,010 --> 01:58:48,250
Get the kidnap with portal.

3460
01:58:51,650 --> 01:58:52,450
Red armor.

3461
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:55,490
We also have to take the craft cannon three times.

3462
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:56,650
Oh, that's easy.

3463
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:58,130
Died out of bounds?

3464
01:58:58,250 --> 01:58:59,150
And he did that last game.

3465
01:58:59,250 --> 01:58:59,910
What the fuck?

3466
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:01,590
Damn, for real.

3467
01:59:01,590 --> 01:59:04,410
You can just sit there and spam spam with somebody.

3468
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:07,050
Troach spam with opponent.

3469
01:59:07,410 --> 01:59:09,350
I actually need to collude with somebody.

3470
01:59:09,950 --> 01:59:14,390
Wait, does this mean one person can do the grab cannon thing?

3471
01:59:15,270 --> 01:59:16,930
Yeah, three round trip.

3472
01:59:17,050 --> 01:59:17,650
Does it not...

3473
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:21,070
No, it just means like it means you go back and forth three times.

3474
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:21,710
Oh, you do it three times?

3475
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:26,910
Yeah, I'm just saying you go back and forth three times because that's a round trip.

3476
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:29,090
Okay, what's the comp then?

3477
01:59:29,090 --> 01:59:30,810
We need... the Watson one is free, right?

3478
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:30,990
Yeah.

3479
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:35,250
The Crypto one's pretty free too if we live, right?

3480
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:36,010
300 damage to EMP.

3481
01:59:37,310 --> 01:59:38,350
And then...

3482
01:59:38,350 --> 01:59:42,690
We can literally just like one person...

3483
01:59:42,690 --> 01:59:43,950
One... wait.

3484
01:59:45,290 --> 01:59:46,790
Does any... does...

3485
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:48,110
uh...

3486
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:49,610
Do they craft?

3487
01:59:50,150 --> 01:59:51,250
Do any of them craft?

3488
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:55,370
Does Crypto or Watson have crafting for banners or no?

3489
01:59:55,370 --> 01:59:56,150
No.

3490
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:59,030
We can just play Crypto and grab the banner and drone.

3491
01:59:59,590 --> 02:00:01,730
I was just thinking... Oh yeah, Crypto would, right?

3492
02:00:02,030 --> 02:00:08,210
No, I'm just thinking if there's crafting we can just have one person fly... literally fly outside the map and then we craft them.

3493
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:15,520
I mean, realistically, it's probably just Crypto, Watson, Valk.

3494
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:16,960
I'd assume... Crypto, Watson, Valk?

3495
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:17,820
Yeah, we can do that.

3496
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:23,480
We do Valk for the Oob as well and try to get someone with the rockets and then you can just...

3497
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,540
Okay, so what are all the ones we can do in POI?

3498
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,200
Noctua Therm?

3499
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:27,680
Noctua PVP?

3500
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:28,880
If we get a good POI.

3501
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,880
Clear with Melee if we get a good POI.

3502
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:34,460
Don't use a survival item.

3503
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:35,780
The Grav Cannon's doable.

3504
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:38,260
That's just one person to do that.

3505
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:40,780
Yeah, the Watson Fence is doable.

3506
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:41,860
Data Audubon's doable.

3507
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,120
Ten Revive's doable.

3508
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:45,460
That's pretty... it's pretty easy.

3509
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:48,740
Is it like full... it's just Noct and Revive, right?

3510
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:51,100
Yeah, we can literally just like PVE that.

3511
02:00:55,190 --> 02:00:56,450
Spam Croach with opponent?

3512
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:01,480
Alright.

3513
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:02,220
We can do that.

3514
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:02,960
That's easy.

3515
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:05,480
Ummm...

3516
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,100
A full inventory of backpacks.

3517
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:10,140
Err, sorry.

3518
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:12,020
A full inventory of Bats, Blue Bag.

3519
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:13,740
Use ult three times.

3520
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,560
Wait, a full inventory of batteries?

3521
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:18,320
Where's that?

3522
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:19,900
The bottom.

3523
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:22,060
Who's playing what?

3524
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:24,820
Oh my god, that's a lot of batteries.

3525
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:30,800
I can do Crypto, I suppose.

3526
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:35,100
I feel like the battery thing is like almost impossible.

3527
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:39,820
Yeah, well we can either play Ummm...

3528
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:45,090
Err, actually I don't know.

3529
02:01:45,150 --> 02:01:45,710
I don't think it matters.

3530
02:01:45,870 --> 02:01:46,010
I don't see...

3531
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:48,210
Where is the Crypto one?

3532
02:01:48,570 --> 02:01:49,910
Um, do 300 damage.

3533
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:50,670
Do 300 damage with EMP.

3534
02:01:50,830 --> 02:01:52,550
Is that overall or like one EMP?

3535
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,950
I think it's overall.

3536
02:01:54,130 --> 02:01:54,890
There's no way it's...

3537
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:58,010
There's no way you can get that in one.

3538
02:01:59,610 --> 02:02:00,030
Yeah.

3539
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:03,350
Like that's... I mean unless you did it at the very end of the game and like...

3540
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:11,790
I mean we could just loot POI, do as many as we can, and then we just try to play UAV, Valko, to get an endgame to play the rest of the game I guess, right?

3541
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:12,350
Yeah.

3542
02:02:13,050 --> 02:02:14,470
We just have to avoid people.

3543
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:17,550
Because we're playing... I mean actually I don't know.

3544
02:02:18,850 --> 02:02:22,470
Hopefully we get a POI with PVE we can get two of them automatically.

3545
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:22,990
Yeah.

3546
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:23,970
That's easy.

3547
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:24,770
True.

3548
02:02:27,370 --> 02:02:28,930
Do you want Valk or Crypto?

3549
02:02:28,930 --> 02:02:29,670
I can play either of them.

3550
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:32,170
I can't play Valk so I'll do Crypto.

3551
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:32,990
Alright, I'll go Valk.

3552
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:34,810
And I'll draw a heart with my fences.

3553
02:02:42,630 --> 02:02:43,310
It's easy.

3554
02:02:43,710 --> 02:02:44,710
There's a P20 knock.

3555
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:46,450
It's your favorite, Heemee!

3556
02:02:46,690 --> 02:02:48,570
Now you can have attachments to it!

3557
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:52,610
Oh my god, I don't have to play on 90 of them?

3558
02:02:52,870 --> 02:02:53,210
Yeah!

3559
02:02:53,870 --> 02:02:54,250
Yeah!

3560
02:02:55,170 --> 02:02:57,050
Oh my god, I just realized.

3561
02:02:57,230 --> 02:02:58,050
It's a great day.

3562
02:02:59,110 --> 02:03:00,330
My mood has improved.

3563
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:05,050
You got so much practice with the P20.

3564
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:08,130
Girl, I had zero damage last game.

3565
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:08,550
Okay.

3566
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:11,290
What practice?

3567
02:03:12,970 --> 02:03:14,250
We didn't buy...

3568
02:03:15,190 --> 02:03:16,650
I'll shoot the spiders.

3569
02:03:18,690 --> 02:03:19,730
We're on Cito.

3570
02:03:20,790 --> 02:03:21,310
Cito.

3571
02:03:21,450 --> 02:03:21,710
Cito Station?

3572
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:23,070
Go Station.

3573
02:03:23,350 --> 02:03:24,370
The new POI.

3574
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:25,350
The new POI is crazy.

3575
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:29,610
There's no PVE though and we're center map.

3576
02:03:29,930 --> 02:03:30,750
Oh, it's horrible.

3577
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:35,330
We might have to just drop some of them and just play for the endgame stuff.

3578
02:03:35,630 --> 02:03:38,150
But we could do the Gravcan and...

3579
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:41,490
Yeah, one of us has to do it though.

3580
02:03:42,750 --> 02:03:44,710
Not all of us have to be there.

3581
02:03:45,110 --> 02:03:48,030
We can do the one at our POI.

3582
02:03:48,030 --> 02:03:53,270
So it's three round trips like couldn't we each just take one round trip and that would be three?

3583
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:56,270
If we all just took it there and back.

3584
02:03:56,570 --> 02:04:00,090
Wouldn't that be three round trips?

3585
02:04:00,190 --> 02:04:00,990
Just each of us?

3586
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:02,610
It doesn't say single person.

3587
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:06,290
Yeah, I think Does that count?

3588
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:10,450
At the very bottom it says use ult three times one person.

3589
02:04:10,610 --> 02:04:14,570
Like it specifies if it's a one person challenge or a group.

3590
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:18,610
So I think we technically could all just take it there and back once and be done.

3591
02:04:19,230 --> 02:04:19,710
Alright.

3592
02:04:19,870 --> 02:04:20,930
Yeah, we can do that.

3593
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:23,510
Wait, the 200 damage with one frag?

3594
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:25,570
We can just do that with PVE, can't we?

3595
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:29,030
Can we just group all the spiders together?

3596
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:30,570
Would that be 200 damage?

3597
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:33,170
Do you damage points on the board?

3598
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:35,870
You do, but I don't know if it means spiders or not.

3599
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:38,390
I mean we also have to do PVE with melee only, so...

3600
02:04:39,790 --> 02:04:42,630
Yeah... I mean if we get the one melee off...

3601
02:04:43,090 --> 02:04:45,450
Oh, is it all PVE as melee?

3602
02:04:45,670 --> 02:04:46,090
Or...

3603
02:04:46,090 --> 02:04:48,450
Clear PVE with melee.

3604
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:49,670
So it has to be all melee.

3605
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:51,890
We have to clear it, but that's like one spider.

3606
02:04:52,210 --> 02:04:54,350
Yeah, we have to fight with people for the PVE.

3607
02:04:54,530 --> 02:05:00,530
But I could throw one nade at like a Prowler and get the bottom one.

3608
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:02,050
200 damage maybe?

3609
02:05:03,170 --> 02:05:04,210
I think it would do 200 though.

3610
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:04,950
I don't know.

3611
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:09,730
I guess we just have to make sure somebody's holed up somewhere and then just throw a nade.

3612
02:05:10,150 --> 02:05:11,410
Yeah, for like a whole team.

3613
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:11,890
Yeah.

3614
02:05:16,330 --> 02:05:16,770
Hmm...

3615
02:05:17,530 --> 02:05:19,110
Hey, now it's one red army.

3616
02:05:19,350 --> 02:05:20,830
Wait, we weren't winning though.

3617
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:21,770
How did someone got 14?

3618
02:05:22,130 --> 02:05:24,550
I mean last game somebody got 14 as well.

3619
02:05:25,170 --> 02:05:26,390
It's the same person.

3620
02:05:27,370 --> 02:05:28,670
Are they just duping challenges?

3621
02:05:29,530 --> 02:05:32,510
It's the same person that got last one as well.

3622
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:35,830
That's crazy.

3623
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:38,610
They got for game two.

3624
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:46,480
I wonder what they did to like hit all of that so fast.

3625
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:50,600
They probably just did the early ones and then had a good game honestly.

3626
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:52,900
Yeah, but they get two in a row?

3627
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:54,160
They're so lucky!

3628
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:57,080
Xenox, why aren't you as lucky as Amu?

3629
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:00,680
It's just impossible to get lucky.

3630
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:08,180
Guys, we have three more games.

3631
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:09,780
Guys, three more.

3632
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:10,180
It's okay.

3633
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:11,340
We don't make it to finals.

3634
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:15,520
That means we have another chance in the other two tournaments.

3635
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:18,140
We're playing the long game here guys.

3636
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:19,400
Guys, just think.

3637
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:20,920
We're playing the long game.

3638
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:23,760
Do you think it's still worth it if we get a good zone and we just rotate to it?

3639
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:23,900
We don't want to do...

3640
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:28,240
We just do the ones in the building and play for like the damage and stuff?

3641
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:30,600
We don't want to go to the finals yet so we can do the other tournaments.

3642
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:31,160
Yeah.

3643
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:32,480
It's like the booster one.

3644
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:33,320
It would take a long time.

3645
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:36,400
It's the long con!

3646
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:37,960
It's the long con.

3647
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:38,780
Trust the process.

3648
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:40,500
I'll make it to the finals.

3649
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,880
I'll make it to the finals on the last tournament.

3650
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:43,080
All of us.

3651
02:06:46,790 --> 02:06:49,110
Where are my pod clips guys?

3652
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:51,370
We should just do it and then camp it.

3653
02:06:51,430 --> 02:06:52,570
We should just do it and then camp it.

3654
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:54,070
Oh my gosh.

3655
02:06:54,330 --> 02:06:55,630
We're camping the cannons?

3656
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:57,970
No, I'd be evil though.

3657
02:06:58,030 --> 02:06:58,110
Oh shit.

3658
02:06:58,230 --> 02:06:58,890
No, we should.

3659
02:06:59,330 --> 02:07:01,450
Finish your grab challenge and then just camp it.

3660
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:02,070
Yeah, no.

3661
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:03,150
We should totally do that.

3662
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:06,770
It's the plan.

3663
02:07:07,010 --> 02:07:07,270
It's the plan.

3664
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:10,910
Even before the crypto fucking scans us though.

3665
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:14,570
I feel like you're gonna throw a crypto drone at us.

3666
02:07:22,430 --> 02:07:24,030
Wait, you guys sent a clip!

3667
02:07:24,210 --> 02:07:25,290
You guys sent a clip!

3668
02:07:25,490 --> 02:07:26,190
There's one clip!

3669
02:07:26,570 --> 02:07:27,410
What is this?

3670
02:07:28,610 --> 02:07:29,930
What the fuck is this?

3671
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,750
Why is it dead?

3672
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:32,530
I'm sending this.

3673
02:07:34,710 --> 02:07:36,890
This is my one clip I'm sending.

3674
02:07:37,050 --> 02:07:39,210
Because that's the only clip I have.

3675
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:51,840
I'm gonna write the only clip my chat was willing to link the clip.

3676
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:57,160
Putting that in there.

3677
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:59,760
That is the only clip you guys did.

3678
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:00,920
I can't believe it.

3679
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:01,180
Guys!

3680
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:05,700
We need actual clips!

3681
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:06,780
It's gonna be voted!

3682
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:10,860
Guys!

3683
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:13,880
This is going to be voted on!

3684
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:16,700
We need actual clips!

3685
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:18,460
We need actual clips!

3686
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:18,640
We need actual clips!

3687
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:21,040
I'm busy editing another one.

3688
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:23,560
Guys, I swear to fucking god.

3689
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:24,820
This is... Oh shit!

3690
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:25,300
Good!

3691
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:28,400
Okay, here we go.

3692
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:30,380
Wait, I'm gonna look at this clip.

3693
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:34,680
I'm watching this.

3694
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:35,100
I'm watching this.

3695
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:40,390
Oh my god.

3696
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:41,130
It's the fucking screen.

3697
02:08:41,150 --> 02:08:41,470
It's the fucking screen.

3698
02:08:41,890 --> 02:08:44,310
It's the fucking screen.

3699
02:08:44,690 --> 02:08:45,550
It's the fucking screen.

3700
02:08:46,850 --> 02:08:48,970
It's the fucking screen.

3701
02:08:49,630 --> 02:08:50,970
Alright, here we go.

3702
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:52,330
Alright, I'm posting that one too.

3703
02:08:53,190 --> 02:08:53,910
It's okay.

3704
02:08:53,990 --> 02:08:55,310
We're gonna game the system.

3705
02:08:55,590 --> 02:08:56,930
If we have enough...

3706
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:58,810
No, we can't have too many clips, guys!

3707
02:08:59,330 --> 02:09:00,170
We can't...

3708
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:02,950
Guys, I know my clips are off, but like...

3709
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:03,910
Guys...

3710
02:09:04,510 --> 02:09:05,490
It is...

3711
02:09:05,490 --> 02:09:07,750
Guys, okay, here's the plan.

3712
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:10,650
We want that thousand dollars.

3713
02:09:11,790 --> 02:09:12,390
That...

3714
02:09:12,390 --> 02:09:16,270
Having clips off should not stop us from this.

3715
02:09:16,610 --> 02:09:17,210
Having clips off should not stop us from this.

3716
02:09:18,150 --> 02:09:21,330
Maybe we just get a crazy zone and we can just sit in zone with the other zombies.

3717
02:09:21,330 --> 02:09:24,290
If you're passionate enough, it will not stop you.

3718
02:09:25,410 --> 02:09:26,830
If you're passionate enough, it will not stop you.

3719
02:09:26,870 --> 02:09:28,030
There you go.

3720
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:31,590
Us, guys!

3721
02:09:31,710 --> 02:09:33,050
This is a team effort!

3722
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:33,570
Us, guys!

3723
02:09:33,570 --> 02:09:33,570
This is a team effort!

3724
02:09:34,370 --> 02:09:36,010
Everyone, team effort!

3725
02:09:37,050 --> 02:09:38,990
Crypto can scan for enemies at least.

3726
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:39,370
Yeah.

3727
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:41,050
Only it's one.

3728
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:43,290
It's one EMP, so you're gonna have to hit like a...

3729
02:09:44,350 --> 02:09:45,850
Multiple team EMP, I think.

3730
02:09:46,590 --> 02:09:46,990
Okay.

3731
02:09:47,210 --> 02:09:47,810
I'll try.

3732
02:09:49,250 --> 02:09:50,110
Hopefully we just get...

3733
02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:51,910
Wait, it's one EMP?

3734
02:09:52,490 --> 02:09:53,590
Like, he said it was one?

3735
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:55,830
Zero said it was one EMP and mine said yes.

3736
02:09:57,010 --> 02:09:57,410
Oh...

3737
02:09:58,570 --> 02:10:00,570
Okay, that's like end zone shit right there.

3738
02:10:00,670 --> 02:10:03,990
You might be able to land on the beacon and hit it twice for double evo.

3739
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:06,690
You should be able to, actually, depending on the timing.

3740
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:08,110
Am I pinging?

3741
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:08,950
That's weird.

3742
02:10:09,530 --> 02:10:11,130
Or is... Oh, hey, see?

3743
02:10:11,150 --> 02:10:13,170
Hey, we have...

3744
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:13,910
We have beacon!

3745
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:16,350
Isn't double evo anymore?

3746
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:17,850
Oh, that's not...

3747
02:10:18,930 --> 02:10:19,590
I'm so sorry.

3748
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:23,050
I'm gonna loot out here and loot in.

3749
02:10:23,170 --> 02:10:25,130
Someone can loot the big building and then...

3750
02:10:25,130 --> 02:10:27,030
And this, and someone just get the middle and stuff.

3751
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:27,970
I'll get the middle and stuff.

3752
02:10:28,730 --> 02:10:29,250
I'll do here.

3753
02:10:30,710 --> 02:10:31,070
Okay.

3754
02:10:31,230 --> 02:10:32,390
Are you not landing on the beacon?

3755
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:34,670
Wait, am I... I don't think you can anymore, apparently.

3756
02:10:35,770 --> 02:10:36,490
Watson can't...

3757
02:10:37,230 --> 02:10:38,710
Wait, do I land on the beacon?

3758
02:10:38,710 --> 02:10:39,430
No, you're the beacon.

3759
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:41,490
Oh, shit!

3760
02:10:41,690 --> 02:10:42,330
Okay, guys, sorry.

3761
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:44,390
You should be able to hit it twice for double evo.

3762
02:10:44,530 --> 02:10:45,970
So I'll do here, I'll do here then.

3763
02:10:46,210 --> 02:10:48,390
I got confused this scans.

3764
02:10:48,690 --> 02:10:50,250
See, this is why I'm the content creator.

3765
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:52,910
I don't remember who does what.

3766
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:56,510
I'll do one...

3767
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:57,630
Wait, can you not do twice anymore?

3768
02:10:57,810 --> 02:10:59,650
I guess not.

3769
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:00,350
That's what someone said.

3770
02:11:00,550 --> 02:11:01,570
If I'm believing him.

3771
02:11:01,650 --> 02:11:01,950
Oh, okay.

3772
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:02,870
I won't do it then.

3773
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:03,390
I don't believe him.

3774
02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:04,470
We were hitting it twice.

3775
02:11:04,810 --> 02:11:05,470
Oh, okay.

3776
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:07,210
No, no, just wait.

3777
02:11:07,270 --> 02:11:08,470
I don't trust.

3778
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:08,890
I don't trust.

3779
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:10,830
We got good zone.

3780
02:11:12,390 --> 02:11:13,450
Oh my god, we did.

3781
02:11:13,730 --> 02:11:15,390
I think we might just play zone this game.

3782
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:16,050
I'm not gonna lie.

3783
02:11:16,230 --> 02:11:17,750
Because we just get in, we can do all of them for free.

3784
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:23,390
I'm already hearing some stuff behind me.

3785
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:25,410
I'm already hearing some stuff behind me.

3786
02:11:25,690 --> 02:11:27,210
Wait, should have said that you should know.

3787
02:11:27,730 --> 02:11:29,110
You're clearly a pro player.

3788
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:29,890
How do you not know?

3789
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:32,370
Well, they updated it.

3790
02:11:32,450 --> 02:11:33,650
And then they reverted the patch.

3791
02:11:33,730 --> 02:11:34,670
And I don't know when they fixed it.

3792
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:39,290
I'm gonna hit this Evo.

3793
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:42,890
If I find a thermite, I'm just gonna do the thermite.

3794
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:44,530
I don't think we have extra.

3795
02:11:45,390 --> 02:11:45,910
I know.

3796
02:11:47,130 --> 02:11:48,810
There's no Evo harvester level.

3797
02:11:50,890 --> 02:11:51,310
There's no.

3798
02:11:51,490 --> 02:11:51,770
Nope.

3799
02:11:52,590 --> 02:11:53,550
I didn't see one.

3800
02:11:53,650 --> 02:11:55,410
I just crafted bat and then we're gonna go zone.

3801
02:11:55,810 --> 02:11:56,730
We can get a good spot here.

3802
02:11:57,090 --> 02:11:57,450
Okay.

3803
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:03,860
Oh, wait.

3804
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:04,940
There's an R9 here.

3805
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,140
Oh, that's a carbine.

3806
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,640
Oh, I thought it was a thermite.

3807
02:12:08,740 --> 02:12:09,240
Nevermind.

3808
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:12,340
Let's go.

3809
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:14,940
Do I get the revive or the fallen stars?

3810
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:18,400
Honestly, I don't even know.

3811
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:22,620
Let's run up on this hill.

3812
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:23,920
And I can vocal.

3813
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:30,740
We gotta melee these.

3814
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:33,640
Let's just play for the challenges.

3815
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:35,640
Let's go melee these spiders.

3816
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:36,880
And then do we let someone die to them?

3817
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:38,780
Yeah.

3818
02:12:38,780 --> 02:12:40,460
Wait, there's a thermite here.

3819
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:41,140
I'm gonna do...

3820
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:43,780
Yeah, I'm gonna down myself now.

3821
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:46,100
Let's wait till we get to the building and the spiders.

3822
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:46,860
Make sure we don't get pushed.

3823
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:47,580
Oh, okay.

3824
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:53,760
I'll do the pylon.

3825
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:55,840
I'll do the pylon.

3826
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:57,620
Oh, wait.

3827
02:12:58,820 --> 02:13:01,200
You can do your heart in this building too if you'd like.

3828
02:13:01,540 --> 02:13:01,860
You can do your heart in this building too if you'd like.

3829
02:13:01,860 --> 02:13:02,600
Yeah, let's get to the building.

3830
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:06,600
There's a care package on this too.

3831
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:07,080
This is really good.

3832
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:10,140
Let's do the PvE last.

3833
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:12,340
You can knock yourself with the thermite in the building.

3834
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:13,540
And do the hearts.

3835
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:15,900
And then we can get the care package and do the PvE stuff.

3836
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:16,540
Alright.

3837
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:19,040
I'll do the hearts.

3838
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:23,260
Wait, I'll knock myself first?

3839
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:24,640
And then do the...

3840
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:26,120
Or someone else can knock themselves.

3841
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:27,580
It doesn't matter.

3842
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,300
Whoever is... just drop your armor and knock yourself.

3843
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:32,920
I'm just gonna start doing the hearts now.

3844
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:39,580
Okay.

3845
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:48,740
Alright, we got the res.

3846
02:13:49,540 --> 02:13:49,940
Yep.

3847
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:52,040
Thank you.

3848
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:55,160
This is not a heart.

3849
02:13:56,300 --> 02:13:56,700
Okay.

3850
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:58,180
Okay.

3851
02:13:58,580 --> 02:14:00,960
Let's do the melee PvE.

3852
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:03,020
And then one person...

3853
02:14:03,020 --> 02:14:03,540
Wait, actually...

3854
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:07,920
The melee PvE and then one person should die to the spiders.

3855
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:08,220
That's not a heart.

3856
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:09,260
Oh, come on.

3857
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:10,200
That is such a heart.

3858
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:10,940
There you go.

3859
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:12,140
That has to be a heart.

3860
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,200
That's like half a heart.

3861
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:15,980
Wait, no.

3862
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:17,440
Like if you think... Yes, it is.

3863
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:18,500
You look at like this direction.

3864
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:20,380
Yes, that's a heart.

3865
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:23,180
I'm not getting heart from this at all.

3866
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:23,640
Come on.

3867
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:24,000
Come on.

3868
02:14:24,020 --> 02:14:24,300
Come on.

3869
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:24,780
Punch these out.

3870
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:25,700
Somebody help me punch these out.

3871
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:26,420
Okay, okay, okay.

3872
02:14:26,540 --> 02:14:27,100
That's a heart.

3873
02:14:27,380 --> 02:14:28,320
I can redo it.

3874
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,260
You work on that another time.

3875
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:30,380
No, no.

3876
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:30,940
You work on that.

3877
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:31,620
I'm gonna go melee.

3878
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:32,720
Okay, okay, wait.

3879
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:33,000
Okay.

3880
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:37,460
Can you keep an eye and make sure nobody walks up while we're doing this?

3881
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:38,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3882
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,060
I'm gonna let them kill me too.

3883
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:40,880
Let them get me low.

3884
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:41,840
Let this one get me low.

3885
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:43,020
Let it kill me.

3886
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:49,140
I'm looking around right now and I'm also making my heart.

3887
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:50,240
I need to go aggro these spiders.

3888
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:53,980
Can they aimbot me?

3889
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,540
Oh my god, they're just missing.

3890
02:14:55,620 --> 02:14:56,120
This is taking forever.

3891
02:14:56,580 --> 02:14:58,280
Wait, I thought you were gonna... Just make sure we don't get walked up on.

3892
02:14:58,540 --> 02:15:01,560
I'm trying to make sure right now while I make this heart.

3893
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:04,860
Okay, kill the rest and then answer resume.

3894
02:15:08,910 --> 02:15:09,850
Okay, there you go.

3895
02:15:09,890 --> 02:15:10,170
Heart.

3896
02:15:10,710 --> 02:15:11,050
Alright.

3897
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:12,790
Just make sure nobody pulls up on us.

3898
02:15:13,010 --> 02:15:13,910
We can punch up for us.

3899
02:15:14,230 --> 02:15:14,570
Okay, I'm gonna punch these.

3900
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:18,340
Can I get a medkit?

3901
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:19,840
I don't have one.

3902
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:21,140
I dropped a headband kit.

3903
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:23,320
Yeah, we did it.

3904
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:23,620
Let's go.

3905
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:26,780
Can we do the grav cannon here maybe?

3906
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:28,120
Yeah, look at this.

3907
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,700
Heart, heart, heart, heart.

3908
02:15:29,780 --> 02:15:30,100
Look at it.

3909
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:32,800
Definitely a heart.

3910
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:37,240
So, do we figure out how much we have to do this actually?

3911
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:38,400
Or do we all just take it twice?

3912
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:40,640
We all take it back and forth once.

3913
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:41,180
We all take it there and back.

3914
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:44,440
Let me take it first just in case.

3915
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:45,120
Make sure there's nobody there.

3916
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:48,420
Okay, we're good.

3917
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:48,820
You can take it.

3918
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:52,040
We did it.

3919
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:56,080
We can grab the EVO harvester and then we're gonna...

3920
02:15:56,080 --> 02:15:56,860
On platform.

3921
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:57,840
On the platform of...

3922
02:15:58,440 --> 02:15:59,100
Okay, take it back.

3923
02:15:59,140 --> 02:15:59,360
Take it back.

3924
02:15:59,740 --> 02:16:00,580
And then we're done.

3925
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:00,960
We're done.

3926
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:02,180
We can take it later.

3927
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:02,820
We can take it later.

3928
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:03,500
We did it.

3929
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:04,160
We did it.

3930
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:07,440
Can you hit this UAV with your drone?

3931
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:09,180
There's a team over here so we just...

3932
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:11,200
I'm grabbing this EVO harvester.

3933
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:12,200
Alright.

3934
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,580
There's a team above on the rock by the way.

3935
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:14,960
God Rock.

3936
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:18,000
Let's just hit UAV with drone.

3937
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:19,620
And then we're gonna play in the barometer.

3938
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:20,980
They're hitting UAV right now.

3939
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:24,500
If they push us, we have to go back to the building and hold it and fight them.

3940
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:28,790
If they push us, we have to go back to the building and hold it and fight them.

3941
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:29,650
How do I hit this shit?

3942
02:16:30,090 --> 02:16:31,330
You just press E on it.

3943
02:16:31,910 --> 02:16:32,230
Nice.

3944
02:16:32,710 --> 02:16:34,450
How do I hit this shit?

3945
02:16:34,690 --> 02:16:35,390
That's not right.

3946
02:16:36,290 --> 02:16:36,610
E.

3947
02:16:37,130 --> 02:16:37,490
There we go.

3948
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:38,570
Let's go back to the building.

3949
02:16:39,450 --> 02:16:39,770
Let's go.

3950
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:40,290
Let's go.

3951
02:16:40,290 --> 02:16:40,290
Let's go.

3952
02:16:40,290 --> 02:16:40,590
Let's go.

3953
02:16:40,650 --> 02:16:41,830
We're gonna go to get up here.

3954
02:16:42,530 --> 02:16:43,510
We're gonna take out from them.

3955
02:16:46,750 --> 02:16:48,550
I'm 500 away from getting the red EVO.

3956
02:16:48,550 --> 02:16:49,090
Holy shit.

3957
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:50,550
A lot of people are like...

3958
02:16:51,390 --> 02:16:53,270
I guess cause they're not getting back out of the ground.

3959
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:55,790
I honestly think we could just go get in the zone and have a good game.

3960
02:16:56,030 --> 02:16:56,730
Yeah we can.

3961
02:16:57,450 --> 02:17:01,090
Let's play for top barometer and hit the UAV up there and then we'll valk ult in the zone.

3962
02:17:01,450 --> 02:17:01,810
Alright.

3963
02:17:02,350 --> 02:17:04,530
There is a barometer team so we might have to...

3964
02:17:04,530 --> 02:17:05,170
Can we valk into it?

3965
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:06,530
Yeah we're gonna valk ult up here.

3966
02:17:08,070 --> 02:17:09,170
I have like...

3967
02:17:09,570 --> 02:17:11,170
2, 4, 6... I have 6 bats.

3968
02:17:11,450 --> 02:17:11,810
I have 6 bats.

3969
02:17:11,830 --> 02:17:13,010
Do you guys have a lot of bats on you?

3970
02:17:13,110 --> 02:17:13,490
I know.

3971
02:17:14,790 --> 02:17:15,590
They're rising right now.

3972
02:17:15,650 --> 02:17:16,030
Come come come.

3973
02:17:16,490 --> 02:17:17,430
I'm right behind.

3974
02:17:18,410 --> 02:17:18,970
I'm here.

3975
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:23,230
Pop your evac on the roof.

3976
02:17:24,670 --> 02:17:25,970
Are we gonna use our survival item?

3977
02:17:26,630 --> 02:17:27,370
Oh yeah true.

3978
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:28,890
Is that one of them?

3979
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:30,650
Don't use any.

3980
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:31,630
You might as well just drop them.

3981
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:34,410
That's a survival item.

3982
02:17:34,650 --> 02:17:35,910
I don't see it on this card.

3983
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:37,190
Oh it is.

3984
02:17:37,890 --> 02:17:38,610
Sorry I'm stupid.

3985
02:17:39,250 --> 02:17:39,610
I'm sorry.

3986
02:17:39,790 --> 02:17:39,790
I'm sorry.

3987
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:41,810
There might be a team riding in the zone.

3988
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:42,010
Let's get this out of here.

3989
02:17:42,130 --> 02:17:42,670
Just be careful.

3990
02:17:43,110 --> 02:17:43,770
We're going or not.

3991
02:17:45,670 --> 02:17:46,890
There's a team over there.

3992
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:50,270
No team.

3993
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:52,790
Can you hit the UAV and barometer with your run again?

3994
02:17:53,270 --> 02:17:53,590
Yep.

3995
02:17:54,650 --> 02:17:56,310
Is there any way we can die to uber on here?

3996
02:18:00,340 --> 02:18:01,940
I don't know if we're gonna be able to do that actually.

3997
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:03,260
Cause we'd have to use our mobi to res.

3998
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:10,230
I mean you have the crypto drone to just fly to mobile res.

3999
02:18:11,150 --> 02:18:12,570
Yeah but there aren't many in the zone.

4000
02:18:13,410 --> 02:18:14,150
There's one here.

4001
02:18:14,210 --> 02:18:14,970
Let's hit the beacon.

4002
02:18:15,110 --> 02:18:16,750
We might be able to just get a good spot in zone soon.

4003
02:18:18,990 --> 02:18:19,870
I'm watching it.

4004
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:23,570
Yeah.

4005
02:18:26,010 --> 02:18:26,810
Let's just go play up here.

4006
02:18:26,890 --> 02:18:27,190
Let's go.

4007
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:27,370
Let's go.

4008
02:18:31,070 --> 02:18:32,490
There is someone up on the hill so.

4009
02:18:34,090 --> 02:18:34,510
Crouch spam.

4010
02:18:35,150 --> 02:18:35,690
If they are.

4011
02:18:36,470 --> 02:18:37,550
We can get the crouch.

4012
02:18:38,270 --> 02:18:39,370
Yeah we gotta get the crouch.

4013
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:44,990
We're probably gonna go to the left.

4014
02:18:45,050 --> 02:18:45,770
I just wanna see if there's any.

4015
02:18:45,770 --> 02:18:46,850
Is anybody up here actually holding it?

4016
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:48,470
They're on my scan no?

4017
02:18:49,010 --> 02:18:50,290
Yeah but I think they're third party.

4018
02:18:50,410 --> 02:18:51,210
They're in the open right here.

4019
02:18:53,550 --> 02:18:53,830
Oh.

4020
02:18:53,910 --> 02:18:54,410
Want me to shoot?

4021
02:18:56,530 --> 02:18:57,310
Or let them walk?

4022
02:18:57,470 --> 02:18:57,810
Can we shoot?

4023
02:18:57,930 --> 02:18:58,690
No let's just go to the corner.

4024
02:18:59,430 --> 02:18:59,710
Whoa.

4025
02:19:01,290 --> 02:19:01,570
Careful.

4026
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:06,150
Let's go quick.

4027
02:19:06,270 --> 02:19:06,990
We can stay here with Jhin.

4028
02:19:07,390 --> 02:19:07,950
Oh somebody.

4029
02:19:08,310 --> 02:19:09,430
And then do we have a lot of nades?

4030
02:19:09,510 --> 02:19:11,510
We could do the down 10 times thing in the corner.

4031
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:12,030
Ummm.

4032
02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:12,910
I only have two.

4033
02:19:13,090 --> 02:19:14,870
I have two nades on me.

4034
02:19:15,670 --> 02:19:17,130
We have how many reses?

4035
02:19:17,130 --> 02:19:18,970
We have one res only right?

4036
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:19,730
We have two.

4037
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:20,070
We have two.

4038
02:19:20,170 --> 02:19:20,830
I died as well.

4039
02:19:21,070 --> 02:19:21,750
Close to me.

4040
02:19:21,750 --> 02:19:22,250
Close to me right here.

4041
02:19:23,250 --> 02:19:23,870
Can you kill him?

4042
02:19:27,270 --> 02:19:28,210
I see him.

4043
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:28,610
Oh.

4044
02:19:29,350 --> 02:19:31,030
You can get a gen down.

4045
02:19:31,050 --> 02:19:32,510
We're gonna play this whole corner area.

4046
02:19:32,670 --> 02:19:34,050
Okay I'll put a gen here.

4047
02:19:35,850 --> 02:19:37,330
And then just get fences up on our back.

4048
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:38,190
Yeah.

4049
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:43,820
Careful.

4050
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:44,540
There's water here.

4051
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:45,280
Whoa.

4052
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:46,660
You can come back here.

4053
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:47,640
You're full safe back here.

4054
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:48,760
No my gen.

4055
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:50,660
He's in the tower.

4056
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:51,060
Just crouch.

4057
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:53,620
I'm literally being grief from everywhere.

4058
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:56,000
Jesus.

4059
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:56,720
I'm batting her hair.

4060
02:19:58,280 --> 02:19:58,640
Well.

4061
02:19:58,860 --> 02:19:59,760
Revive number 3.

4062
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:02,540
I hear a bloodhound ult.

4063
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:03,260
I hear a bloodhound ult.

4064
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:03,560
Okay.

4065
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:04,080
They're walking up.

4066
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:04,780
Yeah.

4067
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:07,200
One is behind the rock.

4068
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:08,940
I can't see them right now.

4069
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:12,500
I'm healing up.

4070
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:14,220
I'm fine.

4071
02:20:15,900 --> 02:20:17,480
You're full safe behind the trees back here.

4072
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:18,400
Okay.

4073
02:20:18,580 --> 02:20:20,220
I'm just fencing up for us.

4074
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:20,940
Yeah you're good.

4075
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:21,160
You're good.

4076
02:20:23,480 --> 02:20:25,520
We could just keep getting knocked to that tower, Tzim.

4077
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:26,400
For the knocks.

4078
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:28,500
Yeah but that gives them...

4079
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:31,100
You can play back here.

4080
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:31,760
Play back on me.

4081
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:33,160
Yeah play back on me.

4082
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,120
I'll wait for my ult and then we can play ult here.

4083
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:38,260
Depending on next zone we might just valk all and go better spot.

4084
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:39,980
We're just kinda waiting for Zona to pull.

4085
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:41,360
Does anyone have a med kit or a white house?

4086
02:20:41,360 --> 02:20:43,480
I can give you two syringes.

4087
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:44,260
That's it though.

4088
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:46,800
Is there anyone you can look for?

4089
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:48,780
We need two teams to do the EMP thing, huh?

4090
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:51,020
Yeah we do.

4091
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:56,540
Oh there's a team across from us.

4092
02:20:57,020 --> 02:20:57,460
Yeah.

4093
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:00,580
That's where they are?

4094
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:02,080
You can just sit behind these for now.

4095
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:03,120
Whoa!

4096
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:06,320
Should be okay.

4097
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:08,160
I'm okay.

4098
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:11,000
No my baby.

4099
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:11,960
I got the red armor one.

4100
02:21:12,700 --> 02:21:13,860
Nice we got red armor.

4101
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:14,200
Nice.

4102
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:18,300
I have...

4103
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:20,140
Let's play back on me.

4104
02:21:21,660 --> 02:21:23,780
Sorry I'm slowly retreading my shield.

4105
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:27,280
I was trying to think if we could just valk up into a spot but...

4106
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:28,420
Gosh this team.

4107
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:30,700
This team is very annoying.

4108
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:33,300
It's one team holding all of Coastal.

4109
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:34,580
Bro I can't...

4110
02:21:34,580 --> 02:21:36,120
I only have one shield cell left.

4111
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:37,480
I can give you some.

4112
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:39,740
Yeah I'm using my last cells right now.

4113
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:41,380
I'm good.

4114
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:43,540
I can regen my shields.

4115
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:46,080
I'm gonna drop a couple and I'm gonna go push this guy off of us.

4116
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:50,340
We're just chillin.

4117
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:51,780
This is our home for now.

4118
02:21:52,660 --> 02:21:53,700
We're just chillin.

4119
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:02,030
Are they fighting down the hill?

4120
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:03,510
We might third party down the hill if they fight.

4121
02:22:03,630 --> 02:22:04,510
Cause there's a team up here.

4122
02:22:04,550 --> 02:22:05,410
They're gonna come shoot us in the back.

4123
02:22:05,550 --> 02:22:05,590
Put it here.

4124
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:09,770
Are there anything else?

4125
02:22:09,810 --> 02:22:10,970
We try and get some eyes on this.

4126
02:22:11,770 --> 02:22:13,570
There really isn't much to look for.

4127
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:17,930
We live in the bamboos.

4128
02:22:18,610 --> 02:22:20,390
There's a team down here so we gotta be careful.

4129
02:22:20,710 --> 02:22:21,070
There's a team down here so we gotta be careful.

4130
02:22:21,130 --> 02:22:24,510
If you can see, if there's two teams playing on each other you can EMP them for the thing.

4131
02:22:24,590 --> 02:22:25,070
If you can see, if there's two teams playing on each other you can EMP them for the thing.

4132
02:22:25,070 --> 02:22:25,690
I know I was trying to look.

4133
02:22:25,810 --> 02:22:29,110
Is there a team walking up the hill from my self 207?

4134
02:22:30,710 --> 02:22:31,290
One team?

4135
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:31,770
Full team here?

4136
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:37,620
I have...

4137
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:41,320
Should I save my Watson gen or use it now?

4138
02:22:41,660 --> 02:22:41,680
Should I save my Watson gen or use it now?

4139
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:43,860
Honestly I'm not sure.

4140
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:44,160
Honestly I'm not sure.

4141
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:45,500
Is this... I think you wait a little bit.

4142
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:45,500
I think you wait a little bit.

4143
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:45,840
I think you wait a little bit.

4144
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,460
We have to play like just loose for now until people...

4145
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:50,540
Is it flying?

4146
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:51,720
Is it flying over us?

4147
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:53,440
We can look to kill them maybe.

4148
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:54,540
They're gonna land in between the team.

4149
02:22:55,780 --> 02:22:57,160
I'm gonna hit the... I'm gonna hit the big nade here.

4150
02:22:57,300 --> 02:22:58,360
Might be the 200 damage nade.

4151
02:22:58,980 --> 02:22:59,480
Break the gen.

4152
02:22:59,480 --> 02:22:59,740
Break the gen.

4153
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:04,580
Gen's broken.

4154
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:05,100
Gen's broken.

4155
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:06,000
I'm right side.

4156
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:06,660
I'm being shot too.

4157
02:23:06,820 --> 02:23:09,160
Yeah yeah this team... I have no heals guys.

4158
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:10,360
I'm literally gonna get knocked too.

4159
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:12,820
I'm looking at our right at the moment.

4160
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:14,060
Keep...

4161
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:16,740
No what?

4162
02:23:17,020 --> 02:23:18,640
Oh I might be dead to this too.

4163
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:21,560
I have to use... yeah I'm dead to this.

4164
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:24,340
I got shot from a team to the right here.

4165
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:25,020
They might push.

4166
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:27,500
Oh no no they got it.

4167
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,080
They got ulted.

4168
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:28,440
They got ulted.

4169
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:30,820
Oh okay goodbye.

4170
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:34,420
I mean I was safe!

4171
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:35,320
I mean I was safe!

4172
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:35,740
I can come back.

4173
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:36,860
I'm gonna wait and see if they're pushing.

4174
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:37,720
So many teams here.

4175
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:40,160
They're running off the hill.

4176
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:41,300
They're running off the hill.

4177
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:41,820
You're dead.

4178
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:42,300
You're dead.

4179
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:43,040
You're dead.

4180
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:43,660
What do you mean?

4181
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:45,960
There's a team coming up the hill right here.

4182
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:49,340
You could have gotten this res.

4183
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:51,760
You could have easily res this.

4184
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:02,850
You could have easily res this.

4185
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:05,170
What other challenges... are there any other challenges?

4186
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:06,930
We've got red armor.

4187
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:07,790
We've got knock.

4188
02:24:08,630 --> 02:24:09,710
One two three.

4189
02:24:09,830 --> 02:24:10,630
Let me look.

4190
02:24:11,010 --> 02:24:13,270
Let me look since I'm fucking dead.

4191
02:24:13,270 --> 02:24:15,490
Have you knocked anyone with your bow crockets?

4192
02:24:15,630 --> 02:24:16,390
You could go for that.

4193
02:24:16,410 --> 02:24:17,610
I'll try to do that this game.

4194
02:24:17,850 --> 02:24:18,330
You could go for that.

4195
02:24:18,530 --> 02:24:19,950
You could go for...

4196
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:24,070
A finisher.

4197
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:26,650
A 360 no scope with a sniper.

4198
02:24:28,310 --> 02:24:29,190
There's a sniper.

4199
02:24:29,390 --> 02:24:30,410
A finisher.

4200
02:24:31,250 --> 02:24:32,870
I could craft you and res.

4201
02:24:32,970 --> 02:24:34,630
Should I try to res you guys right here for fun?

4202
02:24:34,710 --> 02:24:35,550
It counts as two res's now.

4203
02:24:36,270 --> 02:24:36,670
Yeah.

4204
02:24:37,430 --> 02:24:38,430
But is that...

4205
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:38,730
Sure.

4206
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:41,290
There might be a team still there.

4207
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:41,870
But sure.

4208
02:24:41,870 --> 02:24:43,030
There's so many teams back here.

4209
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:44,010
I don't know how you could care.

4210
02:24:44,690 --> 02:24:45,890
I'm gonna say...

4211
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:48,990
If you can get a big ass nade.

4212
02:24:49,090 --> 02:24:49,890
Like a frag nade.

4213
02:24:49,930 --> 02:24:50,430
200 damage.

4214
02:24:52,310 --> 02:24:53,670
I would just try for those two.

4215
02:24:54,550 --> 02:24:55,630
I'm gonna go for the bow crockets.

4216
02:24:56,090 --> 02:24:57,630
You've used your ult three times right?

4217
02:24:57,730 --> 02:24:58,090
Have we?

4218
02:24:59,390 --> 02:24:59,750
Ooh.

4219
02:25:04,250 --> 02:25:04,610
Um.

4220
02:25:05,510 --> 02:25:06,950
I think you used it two times.

4221
02:25:06,950 --> 02:25:07,510
Not three.

4222
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:08,450
Yeah I'm gonna use it one more time.

4223
02:25:10,050 --> 02:25:11,330
Oh there they come.

4224
02:25:15,990 --> 02:25:16,810
Okay what else?

4225
02:25:17,990 --> 02:25:18,990
I think that's it.

4226
02:25:19,070 --> 02:25:20,570
Unless you see a trident driving by.

4227
02:25:21,490 --> 02:25:22,730
What was the trident for?

4228
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:24,450
Stick em with an arc star.

4229
02:25:25,310 --> 02:25:25,710
Oh.

4230
02:25:26,670 --> 02:25:27,950
Wait crouch spamming.

4231
02:25:27,950 --> 02:25:30,110
You can crouch spam and hopefully crouch spam back.

4232
02:25:30,910 --> 02:25:31,730
Before they kill you.

4233
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:33,070
Yeah since you are a rat that would be funny.

4234
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:34,030
Yeah yeah yeah.

4235
02:25:34,170 --> 02:25:34,570
Before...

4236
02:25:34,570 --> 02:25:35,930
Maybe I just run up on em and crouch spam.

4237
02:25:36,410 --> 02:25:37,390
Okay but like not now.

4238
02:25:38,010 --> 02:25:39,050
Yeah do it three in.

4239
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:44,130
It's okay.

4240
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:46,650
If they AD spam you that's a crouch spam.

4241
02:25:47,610 --> 02:25:48,490
That's a crouch spam.

4242
02:25:49,810 --> 02:25:50,690
That counts.

4243
02:25:53,670 --> 02:25:55,960
That counts.

4244
02:25:56,180 --> 02:25:57,620
Oh shit.

4245
02:25:58,760 --> 02:25:59,300
That's one.

4246
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,220
You're so fucked if they push you in front of you.

4247
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:06,280
You're so fucked if they push you in front of you.

4248
02:26:24,060 --> 02:26:25,360
Okay I mute myself.

4249
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:26,980
Cause I don't want to distract him.

4250
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:29,240
Cause he's like super focused right now.

4251
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:30,420
Someone come crouch spam with me.

4252
02:26:30,620 --> 02:26:32,620
This would have been amazing to play as Watson right here.

4253
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:36,160
No it counts cause like...

4254
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:36,500
No.

4255
02:26:36,500 --> 02:26:38,480
They're dodging your bullets by crouch spamming.

4256
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:39,920
So it counts sort of.

4257
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
I'm just gonna crouch spam for the rest of the game.

4258
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:44,600
And pray that someone kills me as crouching.

4259
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,480
Make sure you get your Valkyrie knock first.

4260
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:49,900
Make sure you get your Valkyrie knock first.

4261
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:50,300
With your Q.

4262
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:51,060
Yeah.

4263
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:55,060
There's a full team right behind you.

4264
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:56,520
Yeah I hear them right over here.

4265
02:26:57,660 --> 02:26:58,240
It's okay.

4266
02:26:58,580 --> 02:27:00,120
Maybe they'll be crouched too.

4267
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:02,820
Find another rat.

4268
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:06,080
Oh you're in the middle of the zone.

4269
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:07,500
That is not good.

4270
02:27:11,980 --> 02:27:13,460
I might just Valk all when I get it.

4271
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:15,140
For 2% and just get the point.

4272
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:15,920
We need one more right?

4273
02:27:15,980 --> 02:27:16,480
I've used it twice.

4274
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:17,860
Yeah you only used it twice.

4275
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:19,660
You didn't use it a third time.

4276
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:20,940
You might as well parry this.

4277
02:27:21,900 --> 02:27:22,500
They don't know.

4278
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:25,280
Wait but where would you go?

4279
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:26,640
Oh shit.

4280
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:30,800
I can't go anywhere.

4281
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:33,440
At least you can see where everybody is.

4282
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:35,340
Wait.

4283
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:36,600
Land on top of the silo.

4284
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:37,560
Could be safe.

4285
02:27:39,700 --> 02:27:41,740
Well now you can't land on top.

4286
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:42,080
Oh.

4287
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:43,600
Go crouch spam.

4288
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:48,040
Maybe they'll be good to you.

4289
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:52,140
Look if they crouch once.

4290
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:53,500
That's considered a crouch spam.

4291
02:27:53,940 --> 02:27:54,560
Oh yeah.

4292
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:01,220
Nice.

4293
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:01,860
Nice.

4294
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:03,940
Just live there.

4295
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:07,160
Jesus Christ.

4296
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:08,420
How many teams are there?

4297
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:10,380
That's a lot.

4298
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:12,220
Oh.

4299
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:12,880
No.

4300
02:28:12,980 --> 02:28:13,340
No.

4301
02:28:13,340 --> 02:28:13,900
No time.

4302
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:15,880
You tried.

4303
02:28:16,580 --> 02:28:17,140
Shit.

4304
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:19,560
Didn't even give you the chance.

4305
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:22,160
You should have spammed harder.

4306
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:25,780
It was so close.

4307
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:29,100
How many do we have?

4308
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:31,400
Let's see.

4309
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:32,760
I'm not sure.

4310
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:34,960
This one seemed a lot harder to spam.

4311
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:37,500
One, two, three, four.

4312
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:40,020
Uh...

4313
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:42,340
I think we have six.

4314
02:28:42,460 --> 02:28:42,940
Five.

4315
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:44,040
Six.

4316
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:45,740
Seven.

4317
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:52,200
I think we only have seven?

4318
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:53,640
Yeah melee knock.

4319
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:56,360
Does the melee knock consider with PvE?

4320
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:57,120
I don't think it...

4321
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:59,280
I think the melee knock has to be on a player.

4322
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:00,080
Oh seven.

4323
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:00,280
Seven.

4324
02:29:01,860 --> 02:29:02,920
We have seven.

4325
02:29:03,460 --> 02:29:03,860
Eight.

4326
02:29:04,420 --> 02:29:04,820
Seven.

4327
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:07,840
Wait what are the eight?

4328
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:09,840
We have eight.

4329
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:11,740
One, two...

4330
02:29:11,740 --> 02:29:12,480
Eight.

4331
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:13,440
Yeah.

4332
02:29:13,480 --> 02:29:15,880
I don't think that's a winner.

4333
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:18,060
There's no way.

4334
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:19,460
I feel like more teams got eight.

4335
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:21,940
The highest in there is eight so far.

4336
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:23,180
Yeah but there's still teams alive.

4337
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:26,620
I'm pretty sure teams alive are the ones that are gonna have the...

4338
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:28,660
uh... the most.

4339
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:34,560
Maybe we go back in the VOD and I was crouch spamming and someone else across the map was crouch spamming.

4340
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:34,700
You know what?

4341
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:37,460
I'm pretty sure that happened.

4342
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:41,220
You know when you were wingmanning that one team that was under the bridge?

4343
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:42,080
They were crouch spamming?

4344
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:43,000
They were crouch spamming.

4345
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:44,220
They were trying to dodge your bullets.

4346
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:45,540
That's a nine.

4347
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:49,880
We're not gonna win but it's like the message.

4348
02:29:54,060 --> 02:29:56,000
I feel like that's what we had done earlier.

4349
02:29:56,280 --> 02:29:58,100
There's the get knocked ten time one.

4350
02:29:58,180 --> 02:30:00,080
The ten revive one still teams six at a time.

4351
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:02,080
Well I feel like the out of bounds one we could have done.

4352
02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:03,140
Easily.

4353
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:04,020
Yeah true the out of bounds one.

4354
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:07,800
Ten revives and out of bounds ones we could do.

4355
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:09,860
In the crotch of the opponent.

4356
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:15,340
I put us as nine because I counted the crotch spam.

4357
02:30:16,280 --> 02:30:17,660
We're not gonna win anyways.

4358
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:19,680
Just the message overall.

4359
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:22,080
Just the message overall.

4360
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:22,300
Just

4361
02:30:28,950 --> 02:30:29,470
the message overall.

4362
02:30:29,830 --> 02:30:33,590
I mean we could easily do the revive outside of zone.

4363
02:30:34,750 --> 02:30:36,610
Yeah we could hug zone and just keep rezzing?

4364
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:38,390
Yeah we could have done that.

4365
02:30:39,690 --> 02:30:42,290
Or like just be at the edge of zone and then just revive.

4366
02:30:43,170 --> 02:30:44,290
We can do this next game.

4367
02:30:44,410 --> 02:30:47,350
Knock revive at the edge of zone.

4368
02:30:49,990 --> 02:30:51,070
Red armor is doable.

4369
02:30:51,310 --> 02:30:51,830
Thermite doable.

4370
02:30:52,530 --> 02:30:53,390
DVE is doable.

4371
02:30:55,470 --> 02:30:56,890
No survival items doable.

4372
02:30:57,230 --> 02:30:57,970
Grav cannon doable.

4373
02:30:58,310 --> 02:30:59,810
Yeah we just in this next game we need to do this.

4374
02:30:59,830 --> 02:31:02,330
We have to do the die to bounce and rev to the redstone.

4375
02:31:02,370 --> 02:31:03,710
So we have to sit in zone and heal.

4376
02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:04,270
Yeah.

4377
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:08,010
I think we get bad if we have a bad POI and a bad like zone.

4378
02:31:09,030 --> 02:31:10,010
We can do that.

4379
02:31:10,070 --> 02:31:11,230
Yeah we can just do edge.

4380
02:31:12,730 --> 02:31:13,670
That should be easy.

4381
02:31:14,050 --> 02:31:14,330
Same comp or?

4382
02:31:15,810 --> 02:31:17,210
Do we keep the valk?

4383
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:20,310
I feel like the crypto is like mid.

4384
02:31:21,250 --> 02:31:23,150
I don't think we play for the crypto EMP.

4385
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:24,350
It's kinda high so I'm not gonna lie.

4386
02:31:24,670 --> 02:31:26,050
That's too hard to do.

4387
02:31:27,530 --> 02:31:29,210
What else could help you guys?

4388
02:31:29,310 --> 02:31:29,810
We need to do the...

4389
02:31:29,830 --> 02:31:31,310
We're doing watson for the fence.

4390
02:31:31,490 --> 02:31:32,610
We could play...

4391
02:31:39,510 --> 02:31:40,330
Let's see.

4392
02:31:40,610 --> 02:31:42,270
Because the fence was super easy.

4393
02:31:42,930 --> 02:31:44,610
I mean we could do wraith.

4394
02:31:44,650 --> 02:31:45,750
The portal was...

4395
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:46,090
Or caustic.

4396
02:31:47,270 --> 02:31:48,770
I think caustic is nice.

4397
02:31:51,170 --> 02:31:52,210
Either one.

4398
02:31:52,450 --> 02:31:54,350
I think caustic is good for zone control.

4399
02:31:55,150 --> 02:31:58,170
Yeah with that plus watson we'd be like locked down.

4400
02:31:58,430 --> 02:32:00,210
Yeah people can't push us as easily.

4401
02:32:00,770 --> 02:32:01,290
Yeah people can't push us as easily.

4402
02:32:01,290 --> 02:32:01,430
I'm done.

4403
02:32:03,190 --> 02:32:05,730
Do we do valk just to get in the zone?

4404
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:08,030
Because we're gonna be sitting in zone dying 10 times.

4405
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:11,330
Yeah we can do valk, caustic and watson.

4406
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:12,590
Are there any support characters we can play?

4407
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:15,710
So we can craft banner and rise an oob without having to use a mobi?

4408
02:32:16,010 --> 02:32:17,810
Yeah like a conduit or loba.

4409
02:32:18,230 --> 02:32:19,290
We'll have to get rid of one.

4410
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:21,270
Lifeline could help with the revives.

4411
02:32:21,410 --> 02:32:24,570
We can't get rid of watson because we need watson for the thing.

4412
02:32:24,710 --> 02:32:26,550
We could play lifeline for the red armor if you want.

4413
02:32:26,590 --> 02:32:27,510
Instead of caustic.

4414
02:32:27,530 --> 02:32:29,050
Because it gives you a cash on first place.

4415
02:32:29,150 --> 02:32:30,210
And the revives.

4416
02:32:30,270 --> 02:32:31,030
I could do lifeline.

4417
02:32:31,430 --> 02:32:33,250
Zero got 14 so...

4418
02:32:33,250 --> 02:32:35,470
We were never gonna get close.

4419
02:32:36,170 --> 02:32:37,170
We were second!

4420
02:32:37,690 --> 02:32:38,250
Technically.

4421
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:42,310
If they don't have another 9.

4422
02:32:44,390 --> 02:32:46,050
Yeah zero's team got 14.

4423
02:32:46,290 --> 02:32:47,890
I'm pretty sure they were like end game or something.

4424
02:32:54,550 --> 02:32:58,770
Damn if we were game 3 with second we could have advanced to the finals.

4425
02:33:08,490 --> 02:33:09,350
Let's see.

4426
02:33:10,430 --> 02:33:11,590
What else is there?

4427
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:12,310
I don't know.

4428
02:33:12,310 --> 02:33:12,330
I don't know.

4429
02:33:14,130 --> 02:33:15,310
Let's do the battery one.

4430
02:33:15,490 --> 02:33:16,350
If we play edge.

4431
02:33:17,090 --> 02:33:18,550
Lifeline is good for the battery one actually.

4432
02:33:18,630 --> 02:33:20,110
Don't you get a ton of bats in the back?

4433
02:33:20,270 --> 02:33:20,530
Oh yeah.

4434
02:33:24,610 --> 02:33:26,250
Lifeline, watson, what's the third?

4435
02:33:26,610 --> 02:33:27,830
Valk for the rotation.

4436
02:33:28,050 --> 02:33:28,250
Valk I think.

4437
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:29,210
Yeah sure.

4438
02:33:29,370 --> 02:33:30,430
And then you have the rockets.

4439
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:39,630
This tournament is pretty difficult.

4440
02:33:39,850 --> 02:33:41,290
These challenges are hard.

4441
02:33:42,790 --> 02:33:47,390
I think the hardest part chat right now is just remembering the challenges.

4442
02:33:47,390 --> 02:33:47,610
I think the hardest part chat right now is just remembering the challenges.

4443
02:33:47,610 --> 02:33:50,450
I'm just like what's in the challenges again?

4444
02:33:50,610 --> 02:33:52,570
It's so difficult to remember.

4445
02:33:53,270 --> 02:33:55,610
I'm just listening to what they tell me to do.

4446
02:33:55,730 --> 02:33:56,970
I'm like I don't know.

4447
02:34:00,090 --> 02:34:02,930
I don't even know what the challenges are.

4448
02:34:03,390 --> 02:34:04,390
I'm just like okay.

4449
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:06,910
I'll just exist.

4450
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:09,070
Oh wait nice.

4451
02:34:09,250 --> 02:34:10,350
Okay this is a good clip.

4452
02:34:10,550 --> 02:34:11,450
Good guys.

4453
02:34:11,710 --> 02:34:13,170
Thank you guys for clipping it.

4454
02:34:14,490 --> 02:34:17,230
If we can't win the...

4455
02:34:17,230 --> 02:34:17,590
I'm just like okay.

4456
02:34:17,610 --> 02:34:20,290
If we can't win the fucking...

4457
02:34:20,290 --> 02:34:21,670
The tournament itself.

4458
02:34:21,850 --> 02:34:23,770
We will win the clips challenge.

4459
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:32,820
We will win the clips challenge instead.

4460
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:41,000
I put the goodbye you're dead.

4461
02:34:41,580 --> 02:34:43,680
I put that clip in there.

4462
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:46,420
We gotta get this W somewhere.

4463
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:48,320
I

4464
02:34:56,020 --> 02:34:57,140
can't believe I got that.

4465
02:34:57,160 --> 02:34:57,920
I got left for dead.

4466
02:34:58,200 --> 02:35:02,760
Wait Tempo is running scrims at the same time as this tournament?

4467
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:04,220
No what?

4468
02:35:04,860 --> 02:35:06,900
No wonder he has seven monitors.

4469
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:08,660
I just realized.

4470
02:35:08,740 --> 02:35:10,340
He's running the fucking...

4471
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,760
Apex pro scrims.

4472
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:15,120
The same time as this fucking tournament.

4473
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:20,920
I saw him posted like here are the scores.

4474
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:22,500
From today's scrims.

4475
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:23,440
I was like wait a minute.

4476
02:35:23,780 --> 02:35:25,640
There's a tournament going on.

4477
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:27,480
I'm not even being here.

4478
02:35:27,640 --> 02:35:29,940
The scores are today's scrims.

4479
02:35:31,580 --> 02:35:32,580
Oh my god.

4480
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:33,260
No wonder.

4481
02:35:34,440 --> 02:35:35,600
For those who don't know.

4482
02:35:35,740 --> 02:35:41,020
Tempo runs the pro team scrims in Apex Legends.

4483
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:43,600
So not only is he running this tournament.

4484
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:46,380
But he's also running the scrims at the same time.

4485
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:49,040
So it makes sense why he has seven monitors.

4486
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:52,980
He is definitely multitasking right now.

4487
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:53,860
He is running.

4488
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:55,740
We just need to stack white men's then when we're looting.

4489
02:35:56,620 --> 02:35:57,140
Cause we're looting.

4490
02:35:57,160 --> 02:35:59,200
Cause we're probably gonna have to go sit in zone for the whole game.

4491
02:35:59,300 --> 02:36:00,020
To be able to get all of it.

4492
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:00,820
Cause if we sit in zone.

4493
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,100
We get the out of bounds as well.

4494
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:03,960
We get the revives.

4495
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:04,960
We get the extra bats.

4496
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:08,560
And then that's just an extra three from what we had this last game.

4497
02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:09,300
Yeah.

4498
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:12,280
We have crafting right?

4499
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:14,980
So one of us can fly out of bounds.

4500
02:36:15,580 --> 02:36:16,760
Yeah you can just die instantly.

4501
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:19,480
Yeah so we can get that point instantly.

4502
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,800
Yeah we just play for support bins for the bats.

4503
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:25,400
Oh my god guys.

4504
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:26,360
Guys.

4505
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:27,720
I just realized.

4506
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:29,140
He added the melee.

4507
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:31,780
Remember when I told him to add a knockout with punch?

4508
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:33,420
He actually added it.

4509
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:35,540
We contributed to the tournament.

4510
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:36,500
Look.

4511
02:36:36,700 --> 02:36:37,120
Where is it?

4512
02:36:37,220 --> 02:36:38,540
Get a melee knock.

4513
02:36:38,860 --> 02:36:41,360
We contributed to the card.

4514
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:44,260
I actually wrote that to him.

4515
02:36:47,100 --> 02:36:48,400
We did it.

4516
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:49,980
If we don't win anything.

4517
02:36:50,140 --> 02:36:52,400
At least we had something on the card.

4518
02:36:52,540 --> 02:36:53,400
We helped guys.

4519
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:55,820
All of us helped together.

4520
02:36:57,160 --> 02:37:00,200
This is a group effort of contribution right there.

4521
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:01,200
Nice.

4522
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:02,520
Achievement.

4523
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:06,240
I contributed to the tournament.

4524
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:12,920
Wait what's our POI?

4525
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:15,080
They are doing it right now.

4526
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:15,520
Oh okay.

4527
02:37:15,900 --> 02:37:16,380
Okay.

4528
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:21,580
I can't believe this team got 13.

4529
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:24,200
We would have been like...

4530
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:25,460
We would have been like...

4531
02:37:25,460 --> 02:37:27,100
We are second.

4532
02:37:27,340 --> 02:37:28,640
0-1 before.

4533
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:38,300
I can't believe it.

4534
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:39,380
We were so close.

4535
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:41,280
We were so close.

4536
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:44,060
We are doing our part.

4537
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:45,880
Guys we have so many clips.

4538
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:48,820
Guys we are fucking drowning clips right now.

4539
02:37:49,660 --> 02:37:50,860
Everybody said one.

4540
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:52,000
But I have three.

4541
02:37:52,280 --> 02:37:58,100
I am deleting the meow one.

4542
02:37:58,380 --> 02:37:59,860
I am deleting it.

4543
02:38:01,220 --> 02:38:03,200
I am deleting that.

4544
02:38:03,380 --> 02:38:05,360
This is not going to be on our record.

4545
02:38:05,660 --> 02:38:07,260
Because now we have more clips.

4546
02:38:07,540 --> 02:38:09,740
I am going to delete the cat one.

4547
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:12,340
That's not professional.

4548
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:14,220
That is not professional.

4549
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:17,580
No we are not keeping it.

4550
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:19,740
Nobody is going to vote for it.

4551
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:20,540
Guys.

4552
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:24,240
The votes are happening in girls discord.

4553
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:26,020
You are not in her discord.

4554
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:29,840
Her fans are going to be voting for it.

4555
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:30,800
I am going to be so confused.

4556
02:38:31,380 --> 02:38:32,540
Because the vote...

4557
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:34,240
Don't raid her discord by the way.

4558
02:38:34,360 --> 02:38:36,660
Do not raid her discord.

4559
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,520
It has no gameplay.

4560
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:44,640
No.

4561
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:48,000
Guys we are not rigging the vote.

4562
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:50,140
We are not rigging the vote.

4563
02:38:50,260 --> 02:38:53,080
We have to give good content.

4564
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:53,680
We have the worst giveaway we can get.

4565
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:54,360
Oh man.

4566
02:38:54,620 --> 02:38:55,680
We have to have good content.

4567
02:38:56,140 --> 02:38:59,160
We have to have good content.

4568
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:02,800
Wait but that is good for PvE though.

4569
02:39:02,940 --> 02:39:03,320
Isn't it?

4570
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:05,160
There is no PvE there anymore.

4571
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:06,340
Wait no.

4572
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:08,640
No.

4573
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:09,760
What is the point?

4574
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:13,580
We have the cannons.

4575
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:14,180
We have the cannons.

4576
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:18,700
I think we are going to just have to loot the POI.

4577
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:21,180
And thread the needle.

4578
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:22,460
And make it to like a PvE.

4579
02:39:22,580 --> 02:39:23,260
And just avoid teams.

4580
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:24,580
And work our way out of the zone.

4581
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:27,000
If we want to do the challenges.

4582
02:39:30,550 --> 02:39:31,310
Let me see.

4583
02:39:38,140 --> 02:39:38,660
Alright.

4584
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:39,360
Don't worry.

4585
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,260
It's fine.

4586
02:39:40,460 --> 02:39:41,200
We will be fine.

4587
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:42,100
I believe in this.

4588
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:44,320
Maybe like the zone is like.

4589
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:46,260
So far from us.

4590
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:46,740
Maybe.

4591
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:51,700
So it will be fine.

4592
02:39:55,620 --> 02:39:56,580
Oh my gosh.

4593
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:58,660
I can't believe.

4594
02:39:58,780 --> 02:40:00,560
I can't believe they removed the fucking.

4595
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:02,040
Uh.

4596
02:40:02,580 --> 02:40:05,000
I can't believe they removed the fucking.

4597
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:06,720
This is why I am the content creator.

4598
02:40:07,580 --> 02:40:08,100
Exactly.

4599
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:10,580
This is exactly why.

4600
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:12,780
I am the content creator.

4601
02:40:12,980 --> 02:40:14,040
I didn't even remember.

4602
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:15,500
Where the fuck the.

4603
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:19,600
I didn't even remember the new map does not have PvE anymore.

4604
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:22,940
I am the content creator of this team.

4605
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:23,400
I am the content creator of this team.

4606
02:40:29,330 --> 02:40:30,110
It is fine.

4607
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:31,210
Respect.

4608
02:40:32,690 --> 02:40:34,110
We are not putting Nia back.

4609
02:40:34,290 --> 02:40:35,410
It's not going to win us anything.

4610
02:40:36,110 --> 02:40:36,570
Guys.

4611
02:40:36,670 --> 02:40:38,090
It's not going to win us anything.

4612
02:40:38,310 --> 02:40:41,130
The only reason you wanted there is because you wanted to show on girl stream.

4613
02:40:41,130 --> 02:40:43,810
And that is why I am exactly taking it out.

4614
02:40:43,890 --> 02:40:46,010
This is exactly why I took out that clip.

4615
02:40:46,170 --> 02:40:48,910
Because I am not having that clip show up on stream.

4616
02:40:49,510 --> 02:40:50,770
Because I am not having that clip show up on stream.

4617
02:40:50,770 --> 02:40:51,070
Because I am not having that clip show up on stream.

4618
02:40:51,190 --> 02:40:52,650
It will.

4619
02:40:53,370 --> 02:40:53,890
Okay.

4620
02:40:54,290 --> 02:40:54,810
Okay.

4621
02:40:56,350 --> 02:40:58,470
If I put that clip back.

4622
02:40:58,650 --> 02:40:59,930
If I put that clip back.

4623
02:41:00,090 --> 02:41:00,990
And we don't win.

4624
02:41:01,410 --> 02:41:02,590
You guys owe me.

4625
02:41:03,890 --> 02:41:04,410
Somewhere.

4626
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:11,260
I will get that thousand dollars.

4627
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:11,540
Holy.

4628
02:41:19,190 --> 02:41:20,970
I will get that.

4629
02:41:21,310 --> 02:41:21,830
Somewhere.

4630
02:41:26,970 --> 02:41:28,090
Okay all right.

4631
02:41:28,110 --> 02:41:29,150
All right.

4632
02:41:29,170 --> 02:41:30,530
I will put it back in.

4633
02:41:32,770 --> 02:41:34,390
Just for you guys.

4634
02:41:35,430 --> 02:41:35,950
Okay.

4635
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:39,110
Where the fuck is it?

4636
02:41:39,430 --> 02:41:40,370
Did you guys delete it?

4637
02:41:40,450 --> 02:41:40,850
Oh no no.

4638
02:41:41,010 --> 02:41:42,070
It's still there.

4639
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:42,870
I just went by it.

4640
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:44,770
Slight change in two of the challenges.

4641
02:41:45,590 --> 02:41:46,730
Okay, here we go.

4642
02:41:46,890 --> 02:41:47,630
Oh, slight change.

4643
02:41:49,710 --> 02:41:51,770
Because it caused too much revives.

4644
02:41:51,910 --> 02:41:53,370
Oh, there's no more revives.

4645
02:41:53,730 --> 02:41:56,270
Win a game with less than 1500 damage.

4646
02:41:56,390 --> 02:41:57,430
Which other one did he change?

4647
02:41:57,490 --> 02:41:58,850
And get a knock with a Mozambique.

4648
02:41:59,950 --> 02:42:01,890
Win a game with less than 1500...

4649
02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:03,250
Okay, that's so fucking specific.

4650
02:42:03,770 --> 02:42:05,990
So I guess we don't have to be in zone all game.

4651
02:42:06,090 --> 02:42:07,610
That's actually better for Jurassic, I guess.

4652
02:42:07,850 --> 02:42:08,810
Alright, let's see.

4653
02:42:09,130 --> 02:42:10,570
Okay, I'm putting back the clip, guys.

4654
02:42:10,570 --> 02:42:11,890
I'm putting it back, guys.

4655
02:42:12,690 --> 02:42:15,210
Just for you guys, I'm putting it back.

4656
02:42:15,210 --> 02:42:16,130
You need that.

4657
02:42:16,590 --> 02:42:17,150
Easy.

4658
02:42:17,330 --> 02:42:18,750
That's actually big for us.

4659
02:42:19,090 --> 02:42:22,030
Okay, guys.

4660
02:42:22,270 --> 02:42:24,750
I don't know if you guys noticed, but it says win a game.

4661
02:42:25,690 --> 02:42:26,090
Oh, win.

4662
02:42:26,430 --> 02:42:29,070
Oh, wait a minute.

4663
02:42:29,470 --> 02:42:30,350
Wait, that's impossible.

4664
02:42:30,510 --> 02:42:31,890
Yeah, I'm just saying.

4665
02:42:32,630 --> 02:42:33,750
I'm just saying.

4666
02:42:34,290 --> 02:42:36,390
Let me calm down.

4667
02:42:37,550 --> 02:42:38,110
Yeah.

4668
02:42:39,250 --> 02:42:40,050
I don't...

4669
02:42:40,570 --> 02:42:45,990
The closest we got was when Xenox got us both killed and got it for it.

4670
02:42:50,530 --> 02:42:51,350
It's okay.

4671
02:42:51,770 --> 02:42:52,310
This...

4672
02:42:53,510 --> 02:42:57,990
At least, you know, we can get the Mozambique, I think.

4673
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:03,780
I think that'll work.

4674
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:07,100
I don't know.

4675
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:07,780
This is gonna be weird.

4676
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:10,620
We have to pray there's PB we can get to.

4677
02:43:10,840 --> 02:43:12,440
Wait, who's gonna do the Mozambique then?

4678
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:14,380
Whoever gets one.

4679
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:17,740
Whoever gets the Mozambique does the Mozambique.

4680
02:43:17,860 --> 02:43:20,160
I think no one's ever gonna fucking drive the Trident.

4681
02:43:20,740 --> 02:43:24,900
Unless you're like, colluding with a team and was like, hey, can you get on it?

4682
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:26,380
We can exchange Tridents.

4683
02:43:27,180 --> 02:43:28,660
Same with the crouch spamming.

4684
02:43:28,660 --> 02:43:29,260
It was hard.

4685
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:31,020
They just instantly killed everyone.

4686
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:32,980
You go to crouch spam on someone, you just kill them.

4687
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:36,940
Yeah, but some of them crouch spam to dodge bullets.

4688
02:43:37,100 --> 02:43:38,980
So you both crouch spam to dodge bullets.

4689
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:40,520
It's considered crouch spamming.

4690
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:44,320
There's that.

4691
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:48,080
I hate being social.

4692
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:58,800
I will be an introvert forever.

4693
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:04,740
No!

4694
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:08,280
I spilled my bubble tea.

4695
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:09,860
I was trying to pee.

4696
02:44:14,020 --> 02:44:16,600
This is like me for real.

4697
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:17,200
No!

4698
02:44:18,080 --> 02:44:20,200
I squeezed too much air.

4699
02:44:21,020 --> 02:44:21,460
No!

4700
02:44:21,560 --> 02:44:22,360
I did it again!

4701
02:44:22,820 --> 02:44:23,300
Fuck!

4702
02:44:23,380 --> 02:44:23,660
Okay.

4703
02:44:24,100 --> 02:44:24,700
Okay.

4704
02:44:25,620 --> 02:44:27,660
Let me wipe this off real fast.

4705
02:44:27,820 --> 02:44:28,940
I have a little...

4706
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,660
I have...

4707
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:32,440
I'm a mess.

4708
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:33,400
I'm dropping everything.

4709
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:35,780
I'm a fucking mess right now.

4710
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:38,840
Okay.

4711
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:41,100
Not my bubble tea.

4712
02:44:41,980 --> 02:44:44,220
An extrovert is not worth it.

4713
02:44:46,940 --> 02:44:47,600
It's not.

4714
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:48,760
It's not.

4715
02:44:51,300 --> 02:44:53,320
Let me just fix this real fast.

4716
02:44:54,100 --> 02:44:55,560
Let me just fix this real fast.

4717
02:44:55,560 --> 02:44:55,800
Let me just fix this real fast.

4718
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:56,340
Fix this.

4719
02:44:57,220 --> 02:44:57,700
Fix this.

4720
02:44:57,700 --> 02:44:57,720
Alright.

4721
02:45:00,780 --> 02:45:02,580
It looks like it's stay as locked in.

4722
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:06,900
I don't have to worry about This is game two.

4723
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:07,820
Swapping.

4724
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:09,040
Okay.

4725
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:11,200
Alright.

4726
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:12,680
I'm just...

4727
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:15,960
Make sure... I'm already on Watson.

4728
02:45:16,040 --> 02:45:16,620
I don't have to worry.

4729
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:17,460
Yeah!

4730
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:20,360
Don't have to worry.

4731
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:22,120
Yeah!

4732
02:45:38,400 --> 02:45:38,940
Alright.

4733
02:45:38,980 --> 02:45:40,880
Make sure I unmute myself.

4734
02:45:44,180 --> 02:45:44,720
Alright.

4735
02:45:45,540 --> 02:45:46,480
Here we go.

4736
02:45:46,660 --> 02:45:47,120
We got beacon.

4737
02:45:47,860 --> 02:45:48,520
I guess the...

4738
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:56,340
There might be a universe where we just go to zone because there's no resing ones anymore.

4739
02:45:57,480 --> 02:45:57,820
Wait.

4740
02:45:57,920 --> 02:45:59,500
Are we not gonna fly off the map?

4741
02:45:59,740 --> 02:46:00,800
They got rid of it.

4742
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:01,120
They got rid of it.

4743
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:02,440
Oh, they got rid of flying off the map?

4744
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:03,180
Oh no!

4745
02:46:04,420 --> 02:46:05,740
There's no UUB one either, right?

4746
02:46:06,080 --> 02:46:06,620
Yeah, no.

4747
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:06,960
They're gone.

4748
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:10,740
I'm just gonna line close and line close.

4749
02:46:10,940 --> 02:46:11,820
Somebody do the...

4750
02:46:12,220 --> 02:46:12,820
I'll go over here.

4751
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:13,360
I'll go do this.

4752
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:17,460
One person loot this and then beacon and bunker and stuff.

4753
02:46:17,860 --> 02:46:22,700
Well, if you're not going in the back, I'll land in the back and look my way.

4754
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:24,880
I can do it.

4755
02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:25,480
I'm gonna go to the tunnel.

4756
02:46:25,560 --> 02:46:26,200
I'm gonna do the tunnel.

4757
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:26,880
I'm gonna do the tunnel.

4758
02:46:28,060 --> 02:46:28,980
Oh, I have a thermite.

4759
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:29,760
I can do it right now.

4760
02:46:29,800 --> 02:46:30,280
The thermite.

4761
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:31,980
Oh, wait.

4762
02:46:31,980 --> 02:46:32,380
Actually, no.

4763
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:33,140
I have to wait for you guys.

4764
02:46:33,180 --> 02:46:33,920
I'll come revive you.

4765
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:34,780
Yeah, give me a second.

4766
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:35,060
Yeah, no.

4767
02:46:35,100 --> 02:46:35,320
It's fine.

4768
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:36,380
I'll just wait until you're closer.

4769
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:37,460
And then I'll do the thermite.

4770
02:46:38,280 --> 02:46:38,940
Cool, cool, cool.

4771
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:46,270
I got one of the nades... not nades.

4772
02:46:46,330 --> 02:46:47,010
Bats we need.

4773
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:48,990
Same.

4774
02:46:50,570 --> 02:46:50,850
Alright.

4775
02:46:51,090 --> 02:46:51,370
Alright.

4776
02:46:53,950 --> 02:46:54,230
Scanning.

4777
02:46:54,630 --> 02:46:54,910
Scanning.

4778
02:46:58,310 --> 02:46:58,970
Scanning now.

4779
02:46:59,350 --> 02:46:59,450
Scanning now.

4780
02:47:04,470 --> 02:47:05,270
Scanning now.

4781
02:47:05,270 --> 02:47:05,350
Alright.

4782
02:47:08,570 --> 02:47:09,990
I'm gonna run...

4783
02:47:11,010 --> 02:47:11,450
I'm gonna run...

4784
02:47:11,450 --> 02:47:12,190
I'm just gonna run...

4785
02:47:12,930 --> 02:47:13,730
repeater... well...

4786
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:22,440
Let me know when you're done...

4787
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:22,860
downloading.

4788
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:23,900
You can just come...

4789
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:25,940
come onto the tunnel when you're done.

4790
02:47:26,300 --> 02:47:27,380
Should we take the...

4791
02:47:27,380 --> 02:47:28,300
We can try to do the PV.

4792
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:32,220
You can do the booster on you really quick if you want.

4793
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:33,640
Yeah, I was gonna say we can do the cannon.

4794
02:47:34,540 --> 02:47:37,100
I'm gonna... you guys... I'm gonna grab this EVO really quick so we lose.

4795
02:47:38,140 --> 02:47:39,780
I'm gonna do the thermite right now.

4796
02:47:40,380 --> 02:47:41,620
And then you can give me the...

4797
02:47:42,100 --> 02:47:43,200
the... the suck.

4798
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:45,240
Alright.

4799
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:45,880
I'm doing it.

4800
02:47:45,880 --> 02:47:47,080
Oh, I got the crouch spam with this guy.

4801
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:48,760
Should I be a bastard?

4802
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:50,200
No!

4803
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:51,100
Do it!

4804
02:47:51,280 --> 02:47:51,760
Do it!

4805
02:47:52,540 --> 02:47:53,140
Who cares?

4806
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:54,700
Oh, I might die.

4807
02:47:56,620 --> 02:47:57,260
What happened?

4808
02:47:57,660 --> 02:47:58,880
She just did her thermite.

4809
02:47:58,880 --> 02:47:59,160
Yeah, her thermite.

4810
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:01,620
Oh, I thought there was a team on us.

4811
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:02,140
Yeah, no, no.

4812
02:48:02,140 --> 02:48:03,040
I was doing my thermite.

4813
02:48:03,820 --> 02:48:04,220
Oh, yeah.

4814
02:48:06,460 --> 02:48:06,740
Alright.

4815
02:48:06,740 --> 02:48:07,800
I need the suck now.

4816
02:48:09,500 --> 02:48:10,760
Have you done the booster yet?

4817
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:12,820
Actually, I don't know.

4818
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:13,780
We shouldn't do this one.

4819
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:14,820
The pylon team is gonna kill us.

4820
02:48:14,860 --> 02:48:15,180
Let's go up here.

4821
02:48:16,480 --> 02:48:17,780
What is the booster one exactly?

4822
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:18,560
Oh, here's a Mozamm.

4823
02:48:18,580 --> 02:48:19,980
We just hit the... we have to hit the crab cannon.

4824
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:20,600
Yeah, yeah.

4825
02:48:21,520 --> 02:48:24,060
I'm dropping the senti if anyone wants to get a no scope knock with it.

4826
02:48:24,360 --> 02:48:25,720
I'm doing the Mozamm right now.

4827
02:48:26,140 --> 02:48:26,480
Let's go up here.

4828
02:48:26,480 --> 02:48:27,000
Oh, you're doing Mozamm?

4829
02:48:27,080 --> 02:48:27,360
Okay.

4830
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:28,540
I'm here.

4831
02:48:30,940 --> 02:48:33,520
We might be able to do this crab cannon.

4832
02:48:33,700 --> 02:48:34,400
I'm not sure.

4833
02:48:34,500 --> 02:48:35,240
It's kind of risky.

4834
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:35,900
It's sent him out.

4835
02:48:40,020 --> 02:48:40,960
It's an airdrop over here.

4836
02:48:41,100 --> 02:48:41,820
We should play for this.

4837
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:42,420
We should play for this.

4838
02:48:42,700 --> 02:48:46,500
There was a team over here, so we might have to fight for it.

4839
02:48:49,300 --> 02:48:49,760
Oh, man.

4840
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:51,420
Maybe they won't have blue armor.

4841
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:52,440
Maybe they're still white armor.

4842
02:48:55,100 --> 02:48:56,500
Are we not gonna do the cannon?

4843
02:48:57,360 --> 02:48:59,480
I wanna get the package because we can get red off of it.

4844
02:48:59,700 --> 02:49:00,200
Oh, okay.

4845
02:49:03,340 --> 02:49:04,500
I'm gonna hold right here.

4846
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:05,080
Someone...

4847
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:06,580
There's a team out here.

4848
02:49:06,860 --> 02:49:08,860
Just play these rocks and someone watch behind us.

4849
02:49:09,060 --> 02:49:10,500
I'll watch the back.

4850
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:15,780
You should grab the EVO thing on Lifeline.

4851
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:16,680
You should grab the EVO thing on Lifeline.

4852
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:18,600
And then you can take your care package.

4853
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:19,720
We can get double care package guns.

4854
02:49:19,940 --> 02:49:20,340
Okay.

4855
02:49:22,420 --> 02:49:24,020
Will I get it when I get this?

4856
02:49:24,460 --> 02:49:25,840
If there's an EVO cache in it.

4857
02:49:26,740 --> 02:49:28,000
Just do it with luck.

4858
02:49:29,480 --> 02:49:29,880
Nice.

4859
02:49:30,080 --> 02:49:30,280
Okay.

4860
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:30,940
And then take your...

4861
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:31,960
purple gun.

4862
02:49:32,940 --> 02:49:34,540
Or the care package gun one.

4863
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:35,280
And then we can get another.

4864
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:36,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4865
02:49:37,800 --> 02:49:41,700
And then the upgrade that gives you the care package.

4866
02:49:42,200 --> 02:49:42,840
Lifeline upgrade.

4867
02:49:43,220 --> 02:49:43,620
Oh, sorry.

4868
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:44,120
I was like, wait.

4869
02:49:44,120 --> 02:49:44,680
What are you talking about?

4870
02:49:44,720 --> 02:49:45,440
I looked in the care package.

4871
02:49:46,340 --> 02:49:48,200
All I have is... I have gift.

4872
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:50,840
Next ult is a play drop or gain self revive.

4873
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:51,900
That one.

4874
02:49:51,940 --> 02:49:52,320
The first one.

4875
02:49:52,980 --> 02:49:54,140
I'm gonna take it and scout it.

4876
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:54,820
Make sure there's nobody there.

4877
02:49:54,960 --> 02:49:55,600
We're not gonna do this one.

4878
02:49:56,460 --> 02:49:57,060
Oh, wait.

4879
02:49:58,360 --> 02:49:59,200
Oh, my heart!

4880
02:50:00,860 --> 02:50:01,800
I don't see anybody.

4881
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:02,700
All right.

4882
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:03,240
Do I take it?

4883
02:50:03,280 --> 02:50:03,680
I'm gonna take it.

4884
02:50:04,580 --> 02:50:04,900
Yeah.

4885
02:50:04,980 --> 02:50:05,760
Just give me to take it back.

4886
02:50:07,420 --> 02:50:08,060
And then...

4887
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:09,600
You have to take it too.

4888
02:50:10,480 --> 02:50:10,800
Yeah.

4889
02:50:10,820 --> 02:50:11,720
I already took it the one time.

4890
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:12,860
I just stopped halfway.

4891
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:14,240
All right.

4892
02:50:14,260 --> 02:50:15,520
I've done my double.

4893
02:50:15,960 --> 02:50:16,920
So it's up to...

4894
02:50:16,920 --> 02:50:18,880
Just take it back and come back to me.

4895
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:19,640
I'm not even gonna take it.

4896
02:50:19,700 --> 02:50:21,980
I can just take it and it'll be six.

4897
02:50:21,980 --> 02:50:22,260
Okay.

4898
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:22,580
That's six.

4899
02:50:22,900 --> 02:50:24,580
Let's go for the PvE up here.

4900
02:50:25,860 --> 02:50:27,060
I need to drop my ult.

4901
02:50:28,040 --> 02:50:28,600
I'm gonna die.

4902
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:30,160
You might have to take it back.

4903
02:50:30,280 --> 02:50:30,940
Take it back.

4904
02:50:31,980 --> 02:50:32,480
Take it back.

4905
02:50:33,260 --> 02:50:34,640
We can craft him later.

4906
02:50:34,860 --> 02:50:35,460
Just go craft me.

4907
02:50:35,640 --> 02:50:39,820
There is a crafter not close to us at all.

4908
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:42,100
You can play for cascade.

4909
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:43,520
Just play slow and play for cascade.

4910
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:47,260
I'll go back to cascade then.

4911
02:50:48,980 --> 02:50:49,340
I'll go back to cascade then.

4912
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:49,340
Yeah.

4913
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:49,860
Just play cascade.

4914
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:50,340
Just play slow.

4915
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:52,880
That's unlucky.

4916
02:50:54,800 --> 02:50:56,420
I'm just gonna run to cascade first.

4917
02:50:56,620 --> 02:50:58,160
And if I die, you don't go to cascade.

4918
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:00,140
Or just one of us.

4919
02:51:00,320 --> 02:51:02,200
I feel like...

4920
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:03,880
It's best if I just scout ahead.

4921
02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:06,100
Because then you can just rez both of us if I die.

4922
02:51:06,780 --> 02:51:07,260
Yeah.

4923
02:51:07,960 --> 02:51:09,300
That's much more easier.

4924
02:51:09,560 --> 02:51:10,820
So I'll just go up first.

4925
02:51:13,980 --> 02:51:14,740
Because like...

4926
02:51:14,740 --> 02:51:17,520
I feel like you're gonna get pushed though.

4927
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:19,840
You can rez on the...

4928
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:21,420
We might rez on the...

4929
02:51:21,980 --> 02:51:22,520
Spider Troke.

4930
02:51:22,780 --> 02:51:23,600
The spider one.

4931
02:51:23,700 --> 02:51:24,720
Because we can do the spiders after.

4932
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:26,580
I'll go craft and you head to the spider.

4933
02:51:27,380 --> 02:51:28,980
You go to the spider first.

4934
02:51:31,100 --> 02:51:32,240
I think there's a team there.

4935
02:51:32,440 --> 02:51:33,140
There's a team near me.

4936
02:51:33,440 --> 02:51:34,300
So I'll just grab you now.

4937
02:51:34,300 --> 02:51:35,300
You might have to get me on the waterfall.

4938
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:36,720
I'm just gonna grab you now.

4939
02:51:36,820 --> 02:51:38,800
So if I die, you might as well just craft.

4940
02:51:39,260 --> 02:51:40,180
Like I'm gonna go the other way.

4941
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:42,880
Maybe the one on your right.

4942
02:51:45,740 --> 02:51:46,640
There's a fight to my left.

4943
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:48,040
I'm just gonna go straight to the...

4944
02:51:48,040 --> 02:51:49,700
Don't go to the spider Troke.

4945
02:51:49,740 --> 02:51:50,860
Go to Dokie.

4946
02:51:52,300 --> 02:51:53,960
Sorry, I picked up who you were speaking to.

4947
02:51:54,480 --> 02:51:54,940
It's okay.

4948
02:51:58,100 --> 02:51:59,080
Alright, here I go.

4949
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:01,280
We might get pushed though.

4950
02:52:01,820 --> 02:52:03,020
Probably gonna get pushed.

4951
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:04,920
You can rez me and just run away if you want.

4952
02:52:05,360 --> 02:52:07,920
Also, I don't want Hini to be close to me then.

4953
02:52:08,860 --> 02:52:09,940
He just heard somebody.

4954
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:11,260
No, okay.

4955
02:52:13,720 --> 02:52:15,500
We could do the spiders in front of us.

4956
02:52:15,500 --> 02:52:17,940
Yeah, I'm gonna look command center when I rez in.

4957
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,520
If there's nobody up there, you just both run up there.

4958
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:20,440
Are they here?

4959
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:27,020
You should be good to go command center.

4960
02:52:27,180 --> 02:52:28,480
I don't see anybody yet.

4961
02:52:28,760 --> 02:52:29,260
I'm gonna go.

4962
02:52:29,380 --> 02:52:32,840
I'm gonna shoot the spiders then.

4963
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:35,600
We gotta let one of them knock us too.

4964
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:36,280
We gotta let one of them knock us too.

4965
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:37,400
Knock one.

4966
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:40,640
They could still be up there so be careful.

4967
02:52:40,720 --> 02:52:41,520
I need to lose my guns.

4968
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:42,080
Yeah, I'm just gonna do one first.

4969
02:52:42,180 --> 02:52:42,680
I'm just gonna do one.

4970
02:52:48,690 --> 02:52:49,770
I'm just bad at melee.

4971
02:52:50,030 --> 02:52:50,390
Huh?

4972
02:52:50,870 --> 02:52:51,730
There's the last one.

4973
02:52:55,810 --> 02:52:56,730
You're punching them, yeah?

4974
02:52:56,910 --> 02:52:57,670
Yeah, I'm punching them.

4975
02:52:59,130 --> 02:53:01,170
I'm just doing one at a time and then just let it knock somebody.

4976
02:53:01,170 --> 02:53:03,810
I'm just doing one at a time because I don't wanna risk it.

4977
02:53:04,110 --> 02:53:04,410
I'm just doing one at a time because I don't wanna risk it.

4978
02:53:07,930 --> 02:53:08,870
Yeah, wait for me.

4979
02:53:10,110 --> 02:53:10,770
Yeah, wait for me.

4980
02:53:13,590 --> 02:53:15,250
Alright, I'm just gonna heal up.

4981
02:53:15,550 --> 02:53:17,730
There's the last one.

4982
02:53:18,330 --> 02:53:19,010
There's one more.

4983
02:53:19,270 --> 02:53:20,290
I'll do it.

4984
02:53:20,330 --> 02:53:20,510
Let it...

4985
02:53:20,530 --> 02:53:21,230
Let it kill me, I'm lost.

4986
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:27,860
This is going to take forever.

4987
02:53:27,980 --> 02:53:29,540
Just make sure nobody pulls up while we're doing this.

4988
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:29,960
I'm going to look up.

4989
02:53:29,980 --> 02:53:30,620
I'm looking top.

4990
02:53:30,960 --> 02:53:31,640
Someone look bottom.

4991
02:53:32,760 --> 02:53:36,960
I hear a car below.

4992
02:53:37,160 --> 02:53:37,200
There's a car here.

4993
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:37,660
Go shoot them.

4994
02:53:37,700 --> 02:53:38,560
Shoot that car back on the north.

4995
02:53:39,180 --> 02:53:40,000
Hit it with an arc.

4996
02:53:40,060 --> 02:53:40,560
Hit it with an arc.

4997
02:53:40,680 --> 02:53:41,020
I'll try.

4998
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:41,280
I'll try.

4999
02:53:41,400 --> 02:53:41,840
Where is it?

5000
02:53:41,880 --> 02:53:42,120
Where is it?

5001
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:43,840
Coming up the hill.

5002
02:53:44,220 --> 02:53:45,020
Oh, that way.

5003
02:53:45,220 --> 02:53:45,500
Okay.

5004
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:47,460
Bro, can these spiders shoot me?

5005
02:53:47,560 --> 02:53:49,000
They're hiding behind something.

5006
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:49,640
So they are aggroing me.

5007
02:53:50,280 --> 02:53:50,940
I'm hiding.

5008
02:53:52,720 --> 02:53:54,120
These spiders are like brain dead.

5009
02:53:55,380 --> 02:53:57,260
Just instantly left handers me and punched them out.

5010
02:53:57,520 --> 02:53:58,020
Yeah, I know.

5011
02:53:58,040 --> 02:53:59,620
I just couldn't stay close because...

5012
02:54:00,980 --> 02:54:02,160
I'm looking at top still.

5013
02:54:02,600 --> 02:54:03,920
They're literally just missing on me.

5014
02:54:06,360 --> 02:54:07,420
That's so unfortunate.

5015
02:54:08,520 --> 02:54:09,100
Team below.

5016
02:54:09,220 --> 02:54:09,460
Team below.

5017
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:10,080
Oh no!

5018
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:11,900
Really?

5019
02:54:13,020 --> 02:54:13,720
Can you shoot them?

5020
02:54:13,800 --> 02:54:14,240
Can you shoot them?

5021
02:54:14,320 --> 02:54:14,800
The team below?

5022
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:15,740
Are they walking up?

5023
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:17,280
I can't tell.

5024
02:54:17,560 --> 02:54:18,000
We're good.

5025
02:54:18,060 --> 02:54:18,240
We're good.

5026
02:54:18,280 --> 02:54:19,240
I'm going to risk it.

5027
02:54:19,260 --> 02:54:19,340
Okay.

5028
02:54:19,340 --> 02:54:19,340
Okay.

5029
02:54:19,640 --> 02:54:19,740
Just kill me.

5030
02:54:19,980 --> 02:54:20,800
Just kill me.

5031
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:21,600
Hurry up.

5032
02:54:21,900 --> 02:54:22,140
Please.

5033
02:54:22,440 --> 02:54:23,020
Just shoot down the hill.

5034
02:54:23,100 --> 02:54:23,460
Shoot down here.

5035
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:23,660
Res me.

5036
02:54:23,980 --> 02:54:24,220
Yeah.

5037
02:54:24,260 --> 02:54:24,260
Yeah.

5038
02:54:25,100 --> 02:54:25,620
I got the spider.

5039
02:54:25,700 --> 02:54:26,020
I got the spider.

5040
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:26,860
I can go res.

5041
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:27,120
I'll res.

5042
02:54:27,160 --> 02:54:27,380
I'll res.

5043
02:54:27,420 --> 02:54:27,600
I'll res.

5044
02:54:28,220 --> 02:54:28,680
Just heal.

5045
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:29,000
Just heal.

5046
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:29,120
Just heal.

5047
02:54:29,120 --> 02:54:29,180
I threw a drone already.

5048
02:54:30,740 --> 02:54:31,260
We have to run.

5049
02:54:31,360 --> 02:54:31,880
They're going to push us.

5050
02:54:31,960 --> 02:54:32,620
I don't have fucking shit.

5051
02:54:32,800 --> 02:54:34,100
We have all... We have all... We cleared the spiders.

5052
02:54:34,180 --> 02:54:34,700
We cleared it.

5053
02:54:34,820 --> 02:54:35,000
Okay.

5054
02:54:35,020 --> 02:54:35,300
Let's run.

5055
02:54:35,360 --> 02:54:35,600
Let's run.

5056
02:54:35,620 --> 02:54:35,980
Get up top.

5057
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:36,180
Come on.

5058
02:54:38,040 --> 02:54:39,060
I threw a drone already.

5059
02:54:39,140 --> 02:54:39,360
Sorry.

5060
02:54:39,820 --> 02:54:40,360
I was totally prepared to.

5061
02:54:40,360 --> 02:54:41,680
I just want to... I don't want to die to them.

5062
02:54:41,780 --> 02:54:42,100
It's okay.

5063
02:54:42,740 --> 02:54:43,980
I have a phoenix kit for you.

5064
02:54:44,420 --> 02:54:44,660
Yeah.

5065
02:54:44,700 --> 02:54:45,560
I'll grab it when we get up here.

5066
02:54:46,620 --> 02:54:46,900
Wait.

5067
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:48,180
Did you call the package?

5068
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:48,540
Oh.

5069
02:54:48,640 --> 02:54:49,500
You did already, right?

5070
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:49,900
I did.

5071
02:54:50,020 --> 02:54:50,180
Yeah.

5072
02:54:50,260 --> 02:54:50,440
Okay.

5073
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:50,880
Yeah.

5074
02:54:50,900 --> 02:54:51,120
Yeah.

5075
02:54:51,140 --> 02:54:51,140
Yeah.

5076
02:54:51,140 --> 02:54:52,080
Can I get the phoenix?

5077
02:54:52,700 --> 02:54:52,980
Okay.

5078
02:54:52,980 --> 02:54:53,160
Here you go.

5079
02:54:54,020 --> 02:54:56,260
I'm just going to watch behind us and... really quick.

5080
02:54:57,340 --> 02:54:58,360
Im a lot looking front.

5081
02:54:59,560 --> 02:54:59,840
Okay.

5082
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:00,400
They're not coming.

5083
02:55:00,980 --> 02:55:01,260
Yeah.

5084
02:55:01,280 --> 02:55:02,700
We'll make sure there's nobody in front of us, though.

5085
02:55:03,240 --> 02:55:03,800
I'm gonna...

5086
02:55:05,400 --> 02:55:05,960
I'm going to...

5087
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:06,880
I'm here for... I just put this in here.

5088
02:55:06,900 --> 02:55:07,620
Except that's on my right.

5089
02:55:07,720 --> 02:55:07,820
Okay.

5090
02:55:07,860 --> 02:55:08,020
Left.

5091
02:55:08,140 --> 02:55:08,240
Left.

5092
02:55:08,260 --> 02:55:08,360
Left.

5093
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:08,600
Left of me.

5094
02:55:08,740 --> 02:55:09,020
Okay.

5095
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:09,540
Come back if you have to.

5096
02:55:09,620 --> 02:55:09,820
Okay.

5097
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:13,160
We're just going to wait here till Zunklo's.

5098
02:55:13,580 --> 02:55:13,860
Alright.

5099
02:55:14,100 --> 02:55:14,840
I'm looking at the door.

5100
02:55:14,840 --> 02:55:17,300
I need a scrap loot because I don't have anything.

5101
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:18,580
I can give you meds here.

5102
02:55:18,900 --> 02:55:19,560
Here's chillots.

5103
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:22,820
I can give you syringes though.

5104
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:23,880
I'm gonna scan.

5105
02:55:23,960 --> 02:55:24,600
I can give you syringes.

5106
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:25,220
I have some.

5107
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:25,800
Can we hit beacon?

5108
02:55:25,980 --> 02:55:29,560
I need a sentinel.

5109
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:33,860
Holy fuck.

5110
02:55:33,860 --> 02:55:34,760
Circle is far.

5111
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:38,180
Mmmmm.

5112
02:55:42,780 --> 02:55:43,760
Come this way.

5113
02:55:43,860 --> 02:55:45,540
I might zip up and see if there's anybody up there.

5114
02:55:45,800 --> 02:55:47,960
Wait, there's a sniper here.

5115
02:55:48,220 --> 02:55:48,980
Did you grab the sniper?

5116
02:55:49,300 --> 02:55:49,720
Yeah you did.

5117
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:52,140
I'm just looking for a sentinel.

5118
02:55:59,700 --> 02:56:01,680
There might be a team riding up top.

5119
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:02,740
If there is, then I'm gonna drop.

5120
02:56:03,740 --> 02:56:04,860
I will not be surprised.

5121
02:56:05,620 --> 02:56:07,600
I can put fences at the bottom too.

5122
02:56:07,820 --> 02:56:08,980
Yeah, put a bunch of fences up.

5123
02:56:09,460 --> 02:56:10,680
If I drop, just lifeline res.

5124
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:13,440
They're gonna drop so you have to get ready to insta kill them once you lifeline res me.

5125
02:56:13,660 --> 02:56:13,980
Yeah.

5126
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:16,500
Wait, I have to make a hard still.

5127
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:17,060
Fuck.

5128
02:56:17,440 --> 02:56:18,160
Yeah, you can do that.

5129
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:19,660
Yeah, you need to.

5130
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:24,820
The moment you come... there's nobody above, right?

5131
02:56:25,700 --> 02:56:26,540
I don't know yet.

5132
02:56:26,580 --> 02:56:27,040
I'm just waiting.

5133
02:56:27,260 --> 02:56:29,140
Are you still... oh my god, you're still...

5134
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:31,780
Wait, can we hit the beacon again?

5135
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:35,500
I can... Yeah, I can.

5136
02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:37,000
They're here but they're out here.

5137
02:56:37,960 --> 02:56:38,940
Okay, I can try.

5138
02:56:39,020 --> 02:56:39,320
Okay.

5139
02:56:39,460 --> 02:56:40,100
We don't have to.

5140
02:56:40,900 --> 02:56:41,780
Yeah, if you don't want to.

5141
02:56:42,020 --> 02:56:44,120
I just want to wait until all of us are together.

5142
02:56:44,460 --> 02:56:45,020
You can come up here.

5143
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:46,020
Okay, I'm gonna make the hard.

5144
02:56:46,040 --> 02:56:46,700
I'm gonna make the hard.

5145
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:47,860
I'm coming up.

5146
02:56:47,860 --> 02:56:48,340
Can you do it up here?

5147
02:56:48,660 --> 02:56:49,440
They're on the door.

5148
02:56:49,520 --> 02:56:51,800
We're gonna just Velc ult out of the top of command.

5149
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:53,080
I'm gonna make the hard, guys.

5150
02:56:53,240 --> 02:56:53,800
Give me a sec.

5151
02:56:53,920 --> 02:56:54,260
Yeah, go for it.

5152
02:56:57,080 --> 02:56:57,760
They're on the door.

5153
02:56:57,840 --> 02:56:59,260
They could be riding inside so just be careful.

5154
02:56:59,400 --> 02:57:00,340
I don't think they are though.

5155
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:01,700
I need to wait.

5156
02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:03,880
I don't have enough seconds.

5157
02:57:06,940 --> 02:57:07,640
I fucked up.

5158
02:57:07,680 --> 02:57:08,120
I'm coming back quick.

5159
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:12,560
I fucked up with my offenses.

5160
02:57:13,540 --> 02:57:14,580
Careful, they were on the door.

5161
02:57:19,020 --> 02:57:20,380
I need one more.

5162
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:20,980
I need one more.

5163
02:57:20,980 --> 02:57:22,440
Seven seconds and then I can make my hard.

5164
02:57:25,180 --> 02:57:26,640
We need to make sure they don't come from over here.

5165
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:26,940
We need to make sure they don't come from over here.

5166
02:57:30,440 --> 02:57:31,560
How many bats do we have?

5167
02:57:31,660 --> 02:57:32,700
Do we have enough to do the bat thing?

5168
02:57:32,840 --> 02:57:33,440
Nope, I have one.

5169
02:57:33,640 --> 02:57:34,100
I only have two.

5170
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:35,280
Come over here.

5171
02:57:35,360 --> 02:57:36,560
I'm gonna see if they're up here or not.

5172
02:57:37,020 --> 02:57:37,440
I'm with you.

5173
02:57:37,540 --> 02:57:37,740
They might have left.

5174
02:57:38,520 --> 02:57:38,980
Coming back.

5175
02:57:40,300 --> 02:57:41,240
I made my hard.

5176
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:44,780
They're still all the way back.

5177
02:57:44,800 --> 02:57:45,240
Bullet's flying.

5178
02:57:45,460 --> 02:57:46,140
Is that a third or?

5179
02:57:46,560 --> 02:57:47,420
No, it's the same team.

5180
02:57:47,480 --> 02:57:48,600
We're gonna valk out of the top.

5181
02:57:49,940 --> 02:57:50,320
Hello?

5182
02:57:51,240 --> 02:57:53,220
We just have to slam a spot and pray that it's open.

5183
02:57:58,020 --> 02:57:59,260
I'm praying for you.

5184
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:02,980
Here?

5185
02:58:08,170 --> 02:58:08,550
Whoa.

5186
02:58:10,410 --> 02:58:11,570
This is spooky.

5187
02:58:11,670 --> 02:58:12,050
I'm gonna go back.

5188
02:58:16,110 --> 02:58:17,170
There's definitely a team here.

5189
02:58:18,010 --> 02:58:18,870
I saw some shots.

5190
02:58:20,350 --> 02:58:21,270
Shots from here.

5191
02:58:21,690 --> 02:58:22,430
There's a team there.

5192
02:58:22,550 --> 02:58:23,210
There's a team here.

5193
02:58:24,570 --> 02:58:25,810
There's a... oh ho ho.

5194
02:58:27,190 --> 02:58:27,590
There's a team here.

5195
02:58:27,590 --> 02:58:28,210
We're slamming the back of this.

5196
02:58:28,250 --> 02:58:29,490
We have to instantly get a gen down, okay?

5197
02:58:29,610 --> 02:58:30,250
They're gonna push us.

5198
02:58:30,330 --> 02:58:30,770
They're gonna push us.

5199
02:58:33,910 --> 02:58:34,470
Got gen?

5200
02:58:35,830 --> 02:58:36,110
Nice.

5201
02:58:36,110 --> 02:58:36,450
Just hold.

5202
02:58:36,530 --> 02:58:36,710
Just hold.

5203
02:58:36,790 --> 02:58:37,050
I got a bat.

5204
02:58:37,130 --> 02:58:37,350
I got a bat.

5205
02:58:38,590 --> 02:58:39,270
Papa ult yourself.

5206
02:58:39,310 --> 02:58:39,610
You have one.

5207
02:58:39,910 --> 02:58:40,470
No, I don't.

5208
02:58:40,690 --> 02:58:43,310
I'm trying to...

5209
02:58:44,190 --> 02:58:44,670
I'm trying to take damage.

5210
02:58:45,210 --> 02:58:45,610
Yeah.

5211
02:58:48,590 --> 02:58:49,690
How is this hitting us?

5212
02:58:49,790 --> 02:58:50,470
Oh my gosh, my...

5213
02:58:51,230 --> 02:58:52,010
Do you have drone?

5214
02:58:52,090 --> 02:58:52,850
Any drone right here?

5215
02:58:53,710 --> 02:58:54,510
I just threw it.

5216
02:58:54,550 --> 02:58:54,970
I threw it already.

5217
02:58:55,910 --> 02:58:56,310
Nice.

5218
02:58:57,710 --> 02:58:59,350
Whoa, how is that still?

5219
02:58:59,550 --> 02:59:00,110
It's fine.

5220
02:59:00,210 --> 02:59:00,410
It's fine.

5221
02:59:01,390 --> 02:59:01,830
We're good.

5222
02:59:01,970 --> 02:59:02,470
We're good.

5223
02:59:02,690 --> 02:59:05,770
There you go.

5224
02:59:06,190 --> 02:59:07,850
This is very scuffed, but like...

5225
02:59:07,850 --> 02:59:08,990
Do we have any ulti-excells?

5226
02:59:10,350 --> 02:59:12,150
Yeah, I'm gonna redo the fences now.

5227
02:59:12,390 --> 02:59:13,990
Pop that ulti-excell for...

5228
02:59:14,190 --> 02:59:14,770
For Watson drone.

5229
02:59:16,350 --> 02:59:17,530
Careful, he's like hard starting.

5230
02:59:17,530 --> 02:59:17,910
I know, I know.

5231
02:59:17,970 --> 02:59:18,950
I'm trying to redo this...

5232
02:59:19,710 --> 02:59:20,350
Our fences.

5233
02:59:24,520 --> 02:59:25,260
He's gonna do it.

5234
02:59:25,360 --> 02:59:25,520
Yeah.

5235
02:59:27,260 --> 02:59:27,580
Yeah!

5236
02:59:27,940 --> 02:59:28,260
No!

5237
02:59:30,760 --> 02:59:31,340
What other...

5238
02:59:31,340 --> 02:59:32,600
What other challenges do we have to do?

5239
02:59:33,480 --> 02:59:33,960
Mosem knock.

5240
02:59:34,420 --> 02:59:35,840
Win a game with less damage.

5241
02:59:36,340 --> 02:59:36,980
A finisher.

5242
02:59:37,880 --> 02:59:38,460
Melee knock.

5243
02:59:38,900 --> 02:59:38,920
360.

5244
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:42,020
Okay, so we should just play to win the game at this point.

5245
02:59:42,080 --> 02:59:43,200
We should just play to win the game at this point.

5246
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:44,900
We need the melee finisher.

5247
02:59:45,420 --> 02:59:45,700
360.

5248
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:47,920
I am Mozambique longbow.

5249
02:59:48,060 --> 02:59:49,500
I have the goat loadout right now.

5250
02:59:50,380 --> 02:59:51,280
They're throwing bows up on us.

5251
02:59:51,340 --> 02:59:51,820
Do you have Watson drone?

5252
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:52,520
You can pop this.

5253
02:59:52,540 --> 02:59:53,360
You can get Watson drone if you want.

5254
02:59:54,220 --> 02:59:55,180
Are you close to red armor?

5255
02:59:55,380 --> 02:59:57,500
I'm 44 right now.

5256
02:59:58,360 --> 02:59:59,340
Should I pop it?

5257
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:00,180
I feel like we get it.

5258
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:02,960
How much you off red armor?

5259
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:03,640
224.

5260
03:00:04,220 --> 03:00:06,120
You should try to poke a little bit and try to get it.

5261
03:00:06,180 --> 03:00:07,120
Because it's a free point if we get it.

5262
03:00:07,660 --> 03:00:08,300
Just be careful.

5263
03:00:09,860 --> 03:00:10,940
Maybe we just have to wait.

5264
03:00:11,060 --> 03:00:11,740
I think we might have to wait.

5265
03:00:13,540 --> 03:00:14,120
I'm really okay.

5266
03:00:14,180 --> 03:00:15,340
I'm going to pop my ulti now.

5267
03:00:15,700 --> 03:00:17,020
I don't think we can get it in time.

5268
03:00:20,340 --> 03:00:20,880
Oh my god.

5269
03:00:21,360 --> 03:00:22,100
You got this.

5270
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:22,720
I believe in you.

5271
03:00:22,780 --> 03:00:23,960
You're not 90 FOV anymore.

5272
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:26,560
There's a body out here.

5273
03:00:27,080 --> 03:00:28,000
I'm going to try to loot this body.

5274
03:00:28,420 --> 03:00:29,600
There's a Mozambique on it.

5275
03:00:34,730 --> 03:00:36,730
This is an area.

5276
03:00:38,090 --> 03:00:38,830
I can connect here.

5277
03:00:39,830 --> 03:00:40,150
Nice.

5278
03:00:40,730 --> 03:00:41,450
It looks great.

5279
03:00:42,790 --> 03:00:44,010
I'll take this away.

5280
03:00:44,790 --> 03:00:45,590
And then...

5281
03:00:47,330 --> 03:00:48,310
Connect you here.

5282
03:00:49,790 --> 03:00:50,590
And then...

5283
03:00:50,590 --> 03:00:51,990
Does anyone have another gun I can have?

5284
03:00:52,450 --> 03:00:53,230
What's your other gun?

5285
03:00:53,350 --> 03:00:54,530
I have a vault in 30-30.

5286
03:00:54,610 --> 03:00:57,490
You can have the wingman.

5287
03:00:57,750 --> 03:01:00,410
I have longbow Mozambique.

5288
03:01:00,530 --> 03:01:01,610
I'll take the Mozambique.

5289
03:01:01,770 --> 03:01:03,470
Don't we need the longbow for a knock?

5290
03:01:03,990 --> 03:01:04,810
No, it's sentinel.

5291
03:01:06,870 --> 03:01:07,910
Back that on us.

5292
03:01:09,250 --> 03:01:10,510
Just play in the corner.

5293
03:01:10,550 --> 03:01:10,710
They'll take it.

5294
03:01:10,730 --> 03:01:10,810
They'll die.

5295
03:01:11,090 --> 03:01:11,510
Don't overpeek.

5296
03:01:11,550 --> 03:01:11,890
Don't worry.

5297
03:01:11,990 --> 03:01:12,470
I'm safe.

5298
03:01:12,970 --> 03:01:14,370
We need to get a finish on that.

5299
03:01:15,490 --> 03:01:17,230
Oh, Hemi, be careful.

5300
03:01:19,910 --> 03:01:20,630
Oh, that's mine.

5301
03:01:21,290 --> 03:01:21,710
You're fine.

5302
03:01:23,730 --> 03:01:24,250
We're fine.

5303
03:01:25,670 --> 03:01:27,230
I am fine in this little corner.

5304
03:01:29,170 --> 03:01:29,970
I'm batting.

5305
03:01:30,550 --> 03:01:31,230
Safe on A.

5306
03:01:32,030 --> 03:01:32,930
Yeah, I'm safe too.

5307
03:01:33,770 --> 03:01:35,350
We can't get a finish on that?

5308
03:01:35,690 --> 03:01:36,090
Nope.

5309
03:01:36,190 --> 03:01:37,010
No, we can't.

5310
03:01:37,010 --> 03:01:37,450
I'll flank down here.

5311
03:01:37,550 --> 03:01:39,850
I don't think we should try.

5312
03:01:41,030 --> 03:01:42,390
Do you have a third lifeline pack?

5313
03:01:42,810 --> 03:01:43,970
You call it on so we can get the...

5314
03:01:43,970 --> 03:01:44,530
83.

5315
03:01:47,570 --> 03:01:49,010
Leave these guys behind us to fight.

5316
03:01:49,070 --> 03:01:50,490
Oh, they're gonna fucking ult soon.

5317
03:01:51,730 --> 03:01:53,030
We are definitely not in zone.

5318
03:01:53,930 --> 03:01:55,070
Yeah, this is gonna be tough.

5319
03:01:55,150 --> 03:01:55,370
I know.

5320
03:01:56,530 --> 03:01:58,590
I have evac tower as well, but we shouldn't use it.

5321
03:01:58,630 --> 03:01:59,050
We can't use it.

5322
03:02:00,410 --> 03:02:01,390
They're directly underneath me.

5323
03:02:01,430 --> 03:02:02,690
I might try to go for a Mozambique on them.

5324
03:02:02,810 --> 03:02:03,670
They're right down here.

5325
03:02:03,750 --> 03:02:04,390
This is Jent.

5326
03:02:05,690 --> 03:02:07,630
I'll stay here and keep the fort down.

5327
03:02:07,770 --> 03:02:08,150
I got it.

5328
03:02:08,210 --> 03:02:08,570
Nice!

5329
03:02:08,670 --> 03:02:09,370
You got the knock?

5330
03:02:09,490 --> 03:02:09,750
Nice!

5331
03:02:10,970 --> 03:02:12,130
We'll keep the fort down.

5332
03:02:12,770 --> 03:02:14,630
We play for... how long are we on?

5333
03:02:14,670 --> 03:02:14,910
Care package?

5334
03:02:16,350 --> 03:02:16,710
99.

5335
03:02:16,870 --> 03:02:17,190
It's up.

5336
03:02:17,230 --> 03:02:17,370
It's up.

5337
03:02:17,470 --> 03:02:18,070
Where do you want it?

5338
03:02:18,210 --> 03:02:20,170
Just call it out right here for the point.

5339
03:02:20,170 --> 03:02:21,210
Yeah, just for the door and block.

5340
03:02:22,710 --> 03:02:23,310
Oh, door?

5341
03:02:23,510 --> 03:02:24,090
Oh shit.

5342
03:02:24,170 --> 03:02:25,390
That was not the ping.

5343
03:02:25,390 --> 03:02:25,590
Sorry.

5344
03:02:27,050 --> 03:02:28,250
There is literally nothing.

5345
03:02:30,070 --> 03:02:33,350
Our best bet is to get a Hail Mary Watsona.

5346
03:02:33,530 --> 03:02:33,890
We are there.

5347
03:02:33,890 --> 03:02:34,370
We are there.

5348
03:02:34,390 --> 03:02:37,670
We either Valk all then pray we get it off or we run in and play for KPA.

5349
03:02:37,770 --> 03:02:38,850
Do we need three ults for one person?

5350
03:02:38,990 --> 03:02:39,730
How many ults do we have?

5351
03:02:40,030 --> 03:02:41,090
We already called in three lifeline packs.

5352
03:02:41,370 --> 03:02:42,330
Three lifeline packs.

5353
03:02:42,430 --> 03:02:42,610
Yay!

5354
03:02:48,390 --> 03:02:48,810
Come to me.

5355
03:02:48,830 --> 03:02:49,010
Come to me.

5356
03:02:49,150 --> 03:02:50,310
We're just going to try to rip a Valk all.

5357
03:02:50,390 --> 03:02:51,730
We're going to die if we walk in no matter what.

5358
03:02:52,670 --> 03:02:52,950
Alright.

5359
03:02:52,950 --> 03:02:53,390
We're going to run.

5360
03:02:53,430 --> 03:02:53,990
We're going to run the Valk all thing.

5361
03:02:57,830 --> 03:02:58,990
I'll just throw down the Wattson.

5362
03:03:00,050 --> 03:03:01,650
Wattson the moment I die down.

5363
03:03:01,650 --> 03:03:02,710
There's literally nowhere to go.

5364
03:03:02,810 --> 03:03:02,990
Holy fuck.

5365
03:03:04,130 --> 03:03:05,350
This is a little spooky.

5366
03:03:05,350 --> 03:03:07,150
We're just going to land late and try to third party something.

5367
03:03:09,230 --> 03:03:10,170
We just got to float.

5368
03:03:11,550 --> 03:03:12,310
Maybe go in this corner.

5369
03:03:12,370 --> 03:03:12,710
Go in this corner.

5370
03:03:12,770 --> 03:03:13,110
Go in this corner.

5371
03:03:13,270 --> 03:03:13,550
Alright.

5372
03:03:14,430 --> 03:03:15,310
Very back corner.

5373
03:03:18,350 --> 03:03:19,170
We're hard safe back here.

5374
03:03:19,550 --> 03:03:19,830
Okay.

5375
03:03:20,490 --> 03:03:22,010
We have to shoot the guy on the roof.

5376
03:03:22,010 --> 03:03:22,550
Target the guy on the roof.

5377
03:03:23,630 --> 03:03:24,450
I'm just going to...

5378
03:03:25,050 --> 03:03:26,130
This is the best I can do.

5379
03:03:27,470 --> 03:03:29,310
We just have to hard shoot roof no matter what.

5380
03:03:29,470 --> 03:03:29,750
Yeah.

5381
03:03:29,750 --> 03:03:30,390
I'm just...

5382
03:03:31,470 --> 03:03:32,510
I'm putting my agenda down.

5383
03:03:33,630 --> 03:03:34,710
I'm looking at the roof right now.

5384
03:03:35,350 --> 03:03:36,190
I'm farming them on the roof.

5385
03:03:37,390 --> 03:03:37,870
Drop down.

5386
03:03:37,910 --> 03:03:38,090
Drop down.

5387
03:03:38,910 --> 03:03:39,470
I'll cover.

5388
03:03:39,550 --> 03:03:39,710
I'll cover.

5389
03:03:43,290 --> 03:03:44,090
Cracked them on the roof.

5390
03:03:44,350 --> 03:03:44,550
Knocked one.

5391
03:03:44,630 --> 03:03:44,830
Knocked one.

5392
03:03:44,930 --> 03:03:45,090
Nice.

5393
03:03:45,090 --> 03:03:45,350
Nice.

5394
03:03:45,350 --> 03:03:45,430
Nice.

5395
03:03:45,490 --> 03:03:46,510
I'm going to play to kill it.

5396
03:03:46,830 --> 03:03:47,370
I got red.

5397
03:03:47,370 --> 03:03:47,750
I got red.

5398
03:03:48,130 --> 03:03:48,410
Nice.

5399
03:03:50,670 --> 03:03:51,270
I need to sell up.

5400
03:03:53,230 --> 03:03:54,250
I don't have...

5401
03:03:55,310 --> 03:03:55,810
Knocked another one.

5402
03:03:55,850 --> 03:03:56,170
Knocked another one.

5403
03:03:56,450 --> 03:03:56,730
Nice.

5404
03:03:56,730 --> 03:03:57,990
My drone is up in 9 seconds.

5405
03:03:58,130 --> 03:03:58,450
9 seconds.

5406
03:03:58,770 --> 03:03:59,330
There's just one more.

5407
03:03:59,350 --> 03:04:00,650
Climb up to me and shoot up the knockdown shield.

5408
03:04:00,690 --> 03:04:01,730
There's one person behind knockdowns.

5409
03:04:02,450 --> 03:04:02,950
I can help.

5410
03:04:03,010 --> 03:04:03,310
I can help.

5411
03:04:03,350 --> 03:04:04,030
Shoot up the knockdowns.

5412
03:04:04,030 --> 03:04:04,550
Shoot up the knockdowns.

5413
03:04:06,490 --> 03:04:07,250
I got them.

5414
03:04:07,250 --> 03:04:07,470
Full kill.

5415
03:04:07,590 --> 03:04:07,710
Full kill.

5416
03:04:07,950 --> 03:04:08,650
There's one team inside.

5417
03:04:08,750 --> 03:04:09,090
One team inside.

5418
03:04:10,690 --> 03:04:13,050
We play on the high ground the entire game.

5419
03:04:13,730 --> 03:04:14,550
We play on the high ground the entire game.

5420
03:04:14,550 --> 03:04:14,670
On beacon.

5421
03:04:14,850 --> 03:04:15,110
On beacon.

5422
03:04:15,210 --> 03:04:15,370
On beacon.

5423
03:04:16,550 --> 03:04:17,130
Free shots.

5424
03:04:17,290 --> 03:04:17,510
Free shots.

5425
03:04:17,770 --> 03:04:19,730
I don't have cover.

5426
03:04:21,350 --> 03:04:22,750
We just play the high ground.

5427
03:04:22,870 --> 03:04:23,810
We just play to kill them inside.

5428
03:04:23,810 --> 03:04:24,190
There's people inside.

5429
03:04:25,050 --> 03:04:25,810
I'm going to shield cell.

5430
03:04:26,890 --> 03:04:27,210
I'm going to shield cell.

5431
03:04:27,210 --> 03:04:28,990
Are we going to be able to get another gem?

5432
03:04:29,450 --> 03:04:29,770
No.

5433
03:04:29,990 --> 03:04:30,310
36.

5434
03:04:30,530 --> 03:04:32,070
I don't have all the excel for this.

5435
03:04:32,810 --> 03:04:35,330
I don't have all the excel for this.

5436
03:04:35,330 --> 03:04:36,030
Oh my god.

5437
03:04:36,110 --> 03:04:36,770
They're getting climbed.

5438
03:04:41,430 --> 03:04:42,330
They have a gen in there.

5439
03:04:42,910 --> 03:04:43,890
You see this wall right here?

5440
03:04:45,190 --> 03:04:46,470
We're going to play up here as long as we can.

5441
03:04:46,530 --> 03:04:47,990
We might have to slide out and play that.

5442
03:04:47,990 --> 03:04:48,750
They're left side.

5443
03:04:49,610 --> 03:04:50,750
I'm looking at the story.

5444
03:04:51,870 --> 03:04:52,430
Stay right.

5445
03:04:52,630 --> 03:04:53,910
We just stay up here as long as we can.

5446
03:04:54,250 --> 03:04:54,630
On beacon.

5447
03:04:54,790 --> 03:04:55,030
On beacon.

5448
03:04:55,110 --> 03:04:55,290
On beacon.

5449
03:04:56,510 --> 03:04:57,290
I don't see.

5450
03:04:57,450 --> 03:04:57,670
I don't see.

5451
03:04:57,970 --> 03:04:58,670
Could be free.

5452
03:04:59,250 --> 03:04:59,710
It's a draw.

5453
03:04:59,790 --> 03:05:00,010
It's a draw.

5454
03:05:00,270 --> 03:05:03,150
I don't have bats anymore.

5455
03:05:03,270 --> 03:05:03,850
I'm going to shield cell.

5456
03:05:04,030 --> 03:05:05,430
I'm going to do slow heals.

5457
03:05:05,430 --> 03:05:06,750
I'm going to kill him with Valkyrie.

5458
03:05:07,030 --> 03:05:08,530
I'm going to kill him with Valkyrie.

5459
03:05:08,530 --> 03:05:09,470
You have to help him.

5460
03:05:09,590 --> 03:05:10,930
I have to shield slow heal right now.

5461
03:05:11,030 --> 03:05:11,470
That's fine.

5462
03:05:15,350 --> 03:05:16,770
It's a solo in this pill.

5463
03:05:17,070 --> 03:05:19,090
3 man on the right and 3 man on the left.

5464
03:05:21,350 --> 03:05:22,070
Oh they're...

5465
03:05:22,450 --> 03:05:23,410
Oh they didn't get that.

5466
03:05:23,450 --> 03:05:23,890
They're running.

5467
03:05:24,030 --> 03:05:24,670
Shoot the 3 man.

5468
03:05:25,590 --> 03:05:25,950
Flash.!

5469
03:05:27,110 --> 03:05:27,210
Flash Flash!

5470
03:05:32,730 --> 03:05:33,770
I have no ammo.

5471
03:05:35,450 --> 03:05:35,870
Flash, flash!

5472
03:05:36,050 --> 03:05:37,090
We are burning, burning, burning hard!

5473
03:05:37,150 --> 03:05:38,390
Calm down, calm down, calm down!

5474
03:05:41,070 --> 03:05:41,890
Shoot these guys across!

5475
03:05:42,970 --> 03:05:43,290
Headshot!

5476
03:05:44,370 --> 03:05:44,690
Flash!

5477
03:05:44,830 --> 03:05:45,470
50, flash!

5478
03:05:45,770 --> 03:05:46,250
Knocked him, knocked him!

5479
03:05:46,710 --> 03:05:47,770
Downed on both teams!

5480
03:05:47,870 --> 03:05:48,430
Downed on both teams!

5481
03:05:48,730 --> 03:05:49,370
Do you have nades?

5482
03:05:49,390 --> 03:05:49,630
Nade that!

5483
03:05:49,750 --> 03:05:51,270
No nades, no nades, no nades!

5484
03:05:51,410 --> 03:05:51,770
Got knocked!

5485
03:05:52,330 --> 03:05:53,830
One left, one left on this!

5486
03:05:55,230 --> 03:05:56,710
There is only one guy on this team left!

5487
03:05:57,870 --> 03:05:59,370
They are right below, they are right below!

5488
03:05:59,550 --> 03:06:00,190
Are they resing below us?

5489
03:06:00,190 --> 03:06:00,870
Don't let them res below us!

5490
03:06:01,390 --> 03:06:02,570
I'm trying to make sure...

5491
03:06:02,570 --> 03:06:03,790
They are resing below us!

5492
03:06:03,810 --> 03:06:04,850
Try to shoot down any of them you can!

5493
03:06:05,150 --> 03:06:05,390
Going!

5494
03:06:09,210 --> 03:06:09,910
Full kill, full kill!

5495
03:06:10,010 --> 03:06:10,830
Nice, one team under, one team under!

5496
03:06:10,990 --> 03:06:11,730
Right below, right below!

5497
03:06:12,630 --> 03:06:13,670
It's a duo, it's a duo, it's a duo!

5498
03:06:15,170 --> 03:06:15,910
Flash, flash, flash, flash!

5499
03:06:16,270 --> 03:06:17,070
Knocked one, knocked one, knocked one!

5500
03:06:17,370 --> 03:06:17,670
Last kill!

5501
03:06:20,070 --> 03:06:20,310
Flash!

5502
03:06:21,310 --> 03:06:21,990
Melee, melee, melee!

5503
03:06:22,150 --> 03:06:23,110
Oh, just kill him, just kill him, just kill him!

5504
03:06:23,250 --> 03:06:24,190
Guys, no, no!

5505
03:06:24,470 --> 03:06:25,010
Behind, behind, behind, behind!

5506
03:06:27,910 --> 03:06:28,690
Oh, he is full!

5507
03:06:29,070 --> 03:06:29,810
Play knocked on, play knocked on!

5508
03:06:37,030 --> 03:06:38,370
He is just sitting behind knocked on now.

5509
03:06:39,670 --> 03:06:39,810
I

5510
03:06:53,280 --> 03:06:54,000
wanted to get the melee!

5511
03:06:55,840 --> 03:06:57,080
I had no more bullets!

5512
03:06:57,560 --> 03:06:59,380
Yeah, I ran out of ammo too.

5513
03:06:59,480 --> 03:07:00,520
I ran out of ammo too!

5514
03:07:00,640 --> 03:07:01,360
I ran out of ammo!

5515
03:07:01,420 --> 03:07:02,220
I had no ammo.

5516
03:07:02,280 --> 03:07:02,840
I had no ammo.

5517
03:07:03,200 --> 03:07:04,540
I had no ammo there.

5518
03:07:04,980 --> 03:07:05,580
I didn't know they got that Watson out.

5519
03:07:05,580 --> 03:07:06,780
I honestly didn't know they got that Watson out.

5520
03:07:06,960 --> 03:07:07,860
I had two.

5521
03:07:07,880 --> 03:07:08,220
I had two.

5522
03:07:08,220 --> 03:07:08,740
I didn't know either.

5523
03:07:08,820 --> 03:07:11,160
When you killed that person, I was like, wait, why is that not game over?

5524
03:07:11,320 --> 03:07:12,540
I ran out of ammo.

5525
03:07:13,140 --> 03:07:13,760
I had to melee.

5526
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:14,600
We all ran out of ammo.

5527
03:07:14,680 --> 03:07:15,140
I had no ammo.

5528
03:07:15,140 --> 03:07:15,900
We all had nothing.

5529
03:07:16,760 --> 03:07:20,200
I used the last four bullets of a longbow and hip fire.

5530
03:07:21,380 --> 03:07:22,180
It was bad.

5531
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:23,000
That was so close.

5532
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:26,220
Maybe we got enough knocks overall.

5533
03:07:26,580 --> 03:07:27,540
We didn't see our damage.

5534
03:07:28,380 --> 03:07:29,760
We had way more than 15 on you.

5535
03:07:30,940 --> 03:07:32,140
We got 10 kills.

5536
03:07:32,180 --> 03:07:32,720
We got the kills.

5537
03:07:35,200 --> 03:07:36,020
That's so close.

5538
03:07:36,060 --> 03:07:38,220
We got 10 or more kills and we got 7 or more kills.

5539
03:07:38,540 --> 03:07:38,580
Oh, hey!

5540
03:07:38,660 --> 03:07:38,980
Nice!

5541
03:07:39,880 --> 03:07:41,000
Wait, we actually got a lot.

5542
03:07:41,080 --> 03:07:41,240
Hold on.

5543
03:07:41,280 --> 03:07:41,540
Let's count them up.

5544
03:07:41,600 --> 03:07:42,020
Let's go!

5545
03:07:42,380 --> 03:07:42,620
Let's go!

5546
03:07:42,680 --> 03:07:43,500
We got red armor.

5547
03:07:44,600 --> 03:07:45,240
One, two.

5548
03:07:45,680 --> 03:07:46,800
We died to PvE three.

5549
03:07:47,160 --> 03:07:48,340
We cleared her with melee four.

5550
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:48,920
Yep.

5551
03:07:49,600 --> 03:07:50,100
No finish.

5552
03:07:50,100 --> 03:07:50,560
Ten or more kills.

5553
03:07:50,560 --> 03:07:50,840
Five.

5554
03:07:51,820 --> 03:07:52,980
Don't use this for vital items.

5555
03:07:53,060 --> 03:07:53,500
Six.

5556
03:07:53,680 --> 03:07:54,020
Yeah.

5557
03:07:54,260 --> 03:07:54,700
Seven.

5558
03:07:54,840 --> 03:07:55,340
Grab cannon.

5559
03:07:55,400 --> 03:07:55,840
Seven.

5560
03:07:56,900 --> 03:07:57,720
Watson, eight.

5561
03:07:57,760 --> 03:07:59,720
Wait, did you 360 with your nose gun?

5562
03:07:59,800 --> 03:08:00,080
No.

5563
03:08:00,380 --> 03:08:00,820
No.

5564
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:01,140
No.

5565
03:08:01,140 --> 03:08:01,260
No.

5566
03:08:01,260 --> 03:08:01,460
No.

5567
03:08:01,460 --> 03:08:01,600
No.

5568
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:01,720
No.

5569
03:08:02,020 --> 03:08:02,460
No.

5570
03:08:02,860 --> 03:08:03,300
No.

5571
03:08:04,380 --> 03:08:04,820
No.

5572
03:08:05,300 --> 03:08:05,520
No.

5573
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:05,700
No.

5574
03:08:05,700 --> 03:08:05,960
No.

5575
03:08:05,960 --> 03:08:06,740
All three times.

5576
03:08:06,820 --> 03:08:07,260
Twelve.

5577
03:08:07,480 --> 03:08:07,920
We got twelve.

5578
03:08:08,140 --> 03:08:08,700
We had twelve?

5579
03:08:09,060 --> 03:08:10,380
Aw, I think someone got 14.

5580
03:08:10,500 --> 03:08:11,780
I think someone got 14.

5581
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:12,940
No.

5582
03:08:13,500 --> 03:08:14,700
Oh, come on.

5583
03:08:15,260 --> 03:08:17,320
If I got that melee, it would have been 13.

5584
03:08:17,440 --> 03:08:18,300
I was so unlucky.

5585
03:08:19,060 --> 03:08:19,760
No, no.

5586
03:08:19,820 --> 03:08:20,460
We have 12.

5587
03:08:20,580 --> 03:08:20,840
Wait.

5588
03:08:21,480 --> 03:08:22,180
We got 12.

5589
03:08:23,280 --> 03:08:24,180
I'm pretty sure.

5590
03:08:25,280 --> 03:08:25,720
Someone.

5591
03:08:25,860 --> 03:08:26,900
I'm going to wait until someone posts it.

5592
03:08:26,900 --> 03:08:27,560
I don't see anything.

5593
03:08:28,220 --> 03:08:29,640
Team six also got 12.

5594
03:08:30,140 --> 03:08:31,060
That was crud.

5595
03:08:31,060 --> 03:08:32,160
Because this is a bastard.

5596
03:08:32,680 --> 03:08:33,280
Oh, you're a dead set.

5597
03:08:33,460 --> 03:08:34,220
Oh, I was like...

5598
03:08:35,020 --> 03:08:35,900
Okay, we used the bathroom.

5599
03:08:35,900 --> 03:08:37,100
Are there any more than we got?

5600
03:08:37,160 --> 03:08:38,140
We didn't do batteries.

5601
03:08:38,200 --> 03:08:38,780
We didn't...

5602
03:08:38,780 --> 03:08:40,220
Wait, did you do the Mozambique?

5603
03:08:40,260 --> 03:08:40,880
Yeah, I did.

5604
03:08:40,880 --> 03:08:41,260
Yeah, I did.

5605
03:08:41,260 --> 03:08:43,140
Did anyone hit a big nade or what?

5606
03:08:43,320 --> 03:08:43,680
No.

5607
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:44,120
No.

5608
03:08:44,300 --> 03:08:44,660
No.

5609
03:08:44,700 --> 03:08:45,260
No melee knocks.

5610
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:46,680
I'm going to use the bathroom.

5611
03:08:47,260 --> 03:08:48,000
Oh my gosh.

5612
03:08:48,040 --> 03:08:49,240
We were doing so well there.

5613
03:08:49,840 --> 03:08:50,200
That would have been amazing.

5614
03:08:50,760 --> 03:08:55,700
I mean, the only other one we could have got that game would have been meleeing for the last kill.

5615
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:57,220
For the last kill, which would have given us...

5616
03:08:57,220 --> 03:08:57,600
I mean, we tried.

5617
03:08:57,700 --> 03:08:59,440
We literally all had no ammo, so...

5618
03:08:59,440 --> 03:08:59,880
I know.

5619
03:08:59,940 --> 03:09:01,300
I should have just fucking punched.

5620
03:09:01,460 --> 03:09:01,820
Like...

5621
03:09:02,240 --> 03:09:03,360
I ran out of wingman ammo.

5622
03:09:03,420 --> 03:09:05,420
I was only Mozambique for the endgame and I just ran out.

5623
03:09:08,730 --> 03:09:09,090
Ugh.

5624
03:09:10,290 --> 03:09:11,630
We played that so well though.

5625
03:09:12,970 --> 03:09:13,470
Great job.

5626
03:09:17,010 --> 03:09:20,030
People are tallying up and I don't see anyone with 12.

5627
03:09:21,070 --> 03:09:22,350
The winning team only had four.

5628
03:09:31,460 --> 03:09:32,480
That was crud.

5629
03:09:32,540 --> 03:09:33,200
That was huge.

5630
03:09:33,380 --> 03:09:33,480
That was a bastard.

5631
03:09:33,820 --> 03:09:34,340
That was huge.

5632
03:09:34,340 --> 03:09:35,700
That guy should have just threw and we would have won.

5633
03:09:43,460 --> 03:09:44,860
I mean, Lifeline's OP.

5634
03:09:44,900 --> 03:09:45,160
Yeah.

5635
03:09:45,180 --> 03:09:46,520
Dude, I know.

5636
03:09:46,560 --> 03:09:47,320
The fast res.

5637
03:09:47,620 --> 03:09:47,980
Ugh.

5638
03:09:48,360 --> 03:09:49,300
Like, I might...

5639
03:09:49,300 --> 03:09:51,380
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna play her again just because that was huge.

5640
03:09:54,620 --> 03:09:55,760
I mean, unless...

5641
03:09:56,120 --> 03:09:59,180
Unless you think we have a better chance.

5642
03:09:59,500 --> 03:09:59,860
I think we played the...

5643
03:09:59,860 --> 03:10:00,820
I think we played the same comp.

5644
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:01,860
Did we do it?

5645
03:10:01,900 --> 03:10:02,520
The pull was pretty good.

5646
03:10:02,840 --> 03:10:04,820
The only one we missed was...

5647
03:10:04,820 --> 03:10:05,840
The cost of gold?

5648
03:10:06,340 --> 03:10:07,700
Just meleeing people and stuff.

5649
03:10:07,860 --> 03:10:09,040
And like a sentinel kill.

5650
03:10:09,100 --> 03:10:10,440
But for the most part, we got almost every...

5651
03:10:10,440 --> 03:10:13,680
Well, winning that game wouldn't have given us any more points unless it was a melee kill.

5652
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:15,960
Yeah, it would have just given us like money and the...

5653
03:10:15,960 --> 03:10:16,280
Yeah.

5654
03:10:16,440 --> 03:10:16,640
Yeah.

5655
03:10:16,640 --> 03:10:16,720
Yeah.

5656
03:10:16,720 --> 03:10:18,200
That's so close.

5657
03:10:18,800 --> 03:10:20,520
But so far, we have the most.

5658
03:10:20,660 --> 03:10:21,280
So far.

5659
03:10:21,360 --> 03:10:24,480
Guys, they should give us some pity points there.

5660
03:10:24,760 --> 03:10:25,060
I know.

5661
03:10:25,140 --> 03:10:26,320
We've come second for...

5662
03:10:26,320 --> 03:10:28,120
We've come second so much.

5663
03:10:28,160 --> 03:10:28,920
Like so much.

5664
03:10:29,340 --> 03:10:30,580
Oh my god.

5665
03:10:30,820 --> 03:10:33,860
If I had the ammo, I could have killed her.

5666
03:10:37,220 --> 03:10:38,460
It was so close.

5667
03:10:39,220 --> 03:10:40,200
Guys, please.

5668
03:10:42,320 --> 03:10:45,060
I'm gonna type out 10 gift of shit subs.

5669
03:10:45,200 --> 03:10:46,700
I have 10.

5670
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:48,520
You let us have this.

5671
03:10:51,200 --> 03:10:52,580
Give us 0.5.

5672
03:10:54,780 --> 03:10:59,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

5673
03:10:59,240 --> 03:11:04,300
There's like 8 more teams that have not put their score in.

5674
03:11:05,880 --> 03:11:07,800
You can't still be counting.

5675
03:11:12,820 --> 03:11:13,340
Okay.

5676
03:11:15,140 --> 03:11:16,100
Oh my god.

5677
03:11:16,100 --> 03:11:17,060
I'm like scared now.

5678
03:11:17,180 --> 03:11:17,940
I'm so scared.

5679
03:11:18,080 --> 03:11:20,980
Because like if we get this, I don't have to try anymore.

5680
03:11:22,120 --> 03:11:22,620
Please.

5681
03:11:22,660 --> 03:11:23,760
Please not be...

5682
03:11:23,760 --> 03:11:25,200
Please be less than 12.

5683
03:11:25,960 --> 03:11:26,460
Please.

5684
03:11:26,660 --> 03:11:27,500
Not a lot.

5685
03:11:27,540 --> 03:11:28,020
Thank god.

5686
03:11:28,220 --> 03:11:28,700
Oh, 0.

5687
03:11:29,500 --> 03:11:31,140
Not a lot and 0.

5688
03:11:33,200 --> 03:11:33,700
4.

5689
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:39,920
That was actually a crucial wingman drop.

5690
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:41,480
Oh my god.

5691
03:11:43,640 --> 03:11:44,560
This is it.

5692
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:48,320
Oh, I was fragging.

5693
03:11:48,480 --> 03:11:48,980
I was fragging.

5694
03:11:49,440 --> 03:11:50,740
Guys, I'm like...

5695
03:11:50,740 --> 03:11:52,340
I'm like, you know, like that's like when the one two guys for serious mode there, Chad.

5696
03:11:52,580 --> 03:11:52,880
I...

5697
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:01,580
Guys, I don't know if you guys noticed, but I went full fucking serious mode.

5698
03:12:01,640 --> 03:12:03,360
The moment I was like, wait, we can win this?

5699
03:12:03,540 --> 03:12:06,160
I got wall.

5700
03:12:06,560 --> 03:12:07,620
That's actually really good.

5701
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:08,200
We can get all this.

5702
03:12:08,760 --> 03:12:09,360
Oh, shit.

5703
03:12:09,440 --> 03:12:09,700
Yeah.

5704
03:12:09,860 --> 03:12:10,300
We can.

5705
03:12:10,320 --> 03:12:10,560
Yeah.

5706
03:12:10,660 --> 03:12:12,200
We have two people there ready.

5707
03:12:13,200 --> 03:12:13,600
Wait.

5708
03:12:13,700 --> 03:12:15,020
I think we all lit the POI.

5709
03:12:15,340 --> 03:12:18,980
We go back to the prowlers and we just melee the Molotov.

5710
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:19,740
We're at wall and let one person die.

5711
03:12:19,980 --> 03:12:20,900
It'll be free.

5712
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:21,960
We shouldn't even get third back there.

5713
03:12:22,040 --> 03:12:22,760
Oh, we're at wall.

5714
03:12:22,800 --> 03:12:23,120
W.

5715
03:12:23,120 --> 03:12:23,740
Yeah, that's good.

5716
03:12:23,820 --> 03:12:24,940
We get the... yeah.

5717
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:27,200
Yeah, guys.

5718
03:12:27,400 --> 03:12:29,260
I went full fucking serious mode.

5719
03:12:29,620 --> 03:12:30,640
We kinda did it, guys.

5720
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:32,360
Hopefully.

5721
03:12:32,680 --> 03:12:35,620
Well, I mean, the team that beat us was cross team and they didn't get enough.

5722
03:12:36,020 --> 03:12:36,740
No, they didn't.

5723
03:12:36,820 --> 03:12:37,240
Oh, wait, wait.

5724
03:12:37,280 --> 03:12:39,160
There's another person hopping in.

5725
03:12:39,420 --> 03:12:42,160
They might have actually, because it took so long for them to calculate.

5726
03:12:42,500 --> 03:12:44,020
Well, no, but we had most kills.

5727
03:12:44,120 --> 03:12:45,460
Nobody got the 10 kill one either.

5728
03:12:46,100 --> 03:12:46,980
Yeah, but then...

5729
03:12:46,980 --> 03:12:49,700
I mean, but Giggles is a cost of gain.

5730
03:12:49,840 --> 03:12:51,940
Yeah, Giggles is... she's typing.

5731
03:12:52,120 --> 03:12:53,980
They're calculating right now.

5732
03:12:56,080 --> 03:12:58,680
The late calculators might have it.

5733
03:13:01,860 --> 03:13:04,620
My god, this is like so fucking scary.

5734
03:13:05,240 --> 03:13:05,900
I know.

5735
03:13:10,860 --> 03:13:13,360
This is so fucking tense now.

5736
03:13:13,440 --> 03:13:15,440
We're waiting for like the last couple of people.

5737
03:13:17,880 --> 03:13:20,660
My hands are shaking so hard too.

5738
03:13:20,740 --> 03:13:20,880
I'm team 9.

5739
03:13:20,880 --> 03:13:21,040
We got out of it.

5740
03:13:21,060 --> 03:13:22,340
I'm team 13 with one kill.

5741
03:13:22,480 --> 03:13:22,920
Oh, yeah.

5742
03:13:22,920 --> 03:13:23,660
So what could they have done?

5743
03:13:23,920 --> 03:13:28,600
I need you guys to know my hands were shaking so fucking much when it was at 1v1.

5744
03:13:29,060 --> 03:13:32,540
I... God, if I had the ammo, I would have fucking...

5745
03:13:33,060 --> 03:13:37,120
It wouldn't matter though because like we wouldn't have got any points there.

5746
03:13:37,420 --> 03:13:38,940
But then we get to play again on the 28th.

5747
03:13:39,860 --> 03:13:41,620
And we get more money today.

5748
03:13:41,840 --> 03:13:44,300
Yeah, we can advance to the finals if we get this.

5749
03:13:45,200 --> 03:13:47,960
Did we get... do we get money for getting the most challenges this...

5750
03:13:47,960 --> 03:13:48,440
Yeah.

5751
03:13:48,500 --> 03:13:48,700
Yeah.

5752
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:51,100
If most challenges is 1500 and winning the game is 1500.

5753
03:13:51,360 --> 03:13:51,380
Yeah.

5754
03:13:52,020 --> 03:13:52,740
So like...

5755
03:13:52,740 --> 03:13:55,260
Imagine if we would have had the most...

5756
03:13:55,260 --> 03:13:55,420
I would have won the Thanos game.

5757
03:13:55,640 --> 03:13:56,960
Oh my God.

5758
03:13:56,980 --> 03:13:57,980
That would have been so fantastic.

5759
03:14:00,360 --> 03:14:02,260
Actual Thanos game if we punched him up.

5760
03:14:02,540 --> 03:14:03,000
I know.

5761
03:14:03,220 --> 03:14:04,120
I was so close.

5762
03:14:04,240 --> 03:14:05,120
We should have just fucking aped him.

5763
03:14:05,280 --> 03:14:05,780
I need...

5764
03:14:05,780 --> 03:14:08,400
I just need a call for someone to say just fucking punch them.

5765
03:14:08,480 --> 03:14:09,920
That Watson was like one punch away.

5766
03:14:09,920 --> 03:14:10,920
We wouldn't have wanted to do this.

5767
03:14:11,860 --> 03:14:13,020
The... well, the Cossack.

5768
03:14:13,080 --> 03:14:13,820
I dropped on the Cossack.

5769
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:15,520
I died to the Cossack and I thought it was...

5770
03:14:15,520 --> 03:14:16,700
I thought it was a 2v1 on the side.

5771
03:14:16,800 --> 03:14:17,220
I didn't know the Watson was...

5772
03:14:17,220 --> 03:14:17,920
Yeah, you said 2v1.

5773
03:14:17,920 --> 03:14:18,480
Oh, you didn't know the Watson was...

5774
03:14:18,480 --> 03:14:19,100
I already knocked...

5775
03:14:19,100 --> 03:14:19,880
I knocked what?

5776
03:14:20,020 --> 03:14:20,500
Yeah, no.

5777
03:14:20,600 --> 03:14:21,640
I thought it was a bad combo.

5778
03:14:21,920 --> 03:14:23,900
Yeah, so then I was like, oh hey, it's your guy left.

5779
03:14:24,020 --> 03:14:25,680
And then I knocked him when you got knocked.

5780
03:14:25,820 --> 03:14:27,960
And then I was like, wait, how come we didn't win?

5781
03:14:28,260 --> 03:14:29,320
The game wasn't over.

5782
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:30,560
Where's the champion?

5783
03:14:30,660 --> 03:14:32,540
And then... and then He-Me died.

5784
03:14:32,680 --> 03:14:33,720
I was like, oh no.

5785
03:14:34,300 --> 03:14:34,920
Yeah, it was bad.

5786
03:14:35,360 --> 03:14:35,680
No.

5787
03:14:35,740 --> 03:14:36,740
I was hit by a long bow.

5788
03:14:36,820 --> 03:14:37,060
It was bad.

5789
03:14:37,260 --> 03:14:38,480
The Mozambique is kind of OP.

5790
03:14:39,180 --> 03:14:39,620
No, wait.

5791
03:14:39,640 --> 03:14:41,040
I heard it actually is nice now.

5792
03:14:41,100 --> 03:14:41,860
Like this season.

5793
03:14:42,480 --> 03:14:44,660
I think maybe...

5794
03:14:46,360 --> 03:14:48,420
Maybe we just need to be Mozangamers.

5795
03:14:48,480 --> 03:14:50,320
Yo, I think we did it.

5796
03:14:51,480 --> 03:14:53,740
Guys, no, don't give up my hopes up, guys.

5797
03:14:53,840 --> 03:14:55,480
Don't do this to me.

5798
03:14:55,480 --> 03:14:57,040
We gotta pray for the legit worst.

5799
03:14:57,280 --> 03:15:01,020
There's people that have not finished calculating and that's the scary part.

5800
03:15:01,620 --> 03:15:04,520
Gagos has four more teams left that need to submit.

5801
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:07,920
Gagos did not say anything and that freaks me out.

5802
03:15:08,620 --> 03:15:09,380
I know.

5803
03:15:09,660 --> 03:15:10,760
Well, what team are they on?

5804
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:12,140
At nine.

5805
03:15:12,700 --> 03:15:13,520
Team nine?

5806
03:15:13,880 --> 03:15:14,280
Yeah.

5807
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:17,660
Where did they land last game?

5808
03:15:17,720 --> 03:15:18,040
Do we know?

5809
03:15:18,480 --> 03:15:18,760
Team nine got 11.

5810
03:15:18,940 --> 03:15:19,460
Oh my God.

5811
03:15:19,500 --> 03:15:19,820
Oh, okay.

5812
03:15:20,060 --> 03:15:21,760
The team that won got 11.

5813
03:15:22,460 --> 03:15:22,860
Okay.

5814
03:15:22,900 --> 03:15:24,600
Wait, which team was Gagos on?

5815
03:15:25,580 --> 03:15:26,260
Team nine.

5816
03:15:26,940 --> 03:15:27,820
I don't know what POI they had.

5817
03:15:28,780 --> 03:15:29,580
They had...

5818
03:15:29,580 --> 03:15:30,160
They had...

5819
03:15:30,620 --> 03:15:31,940
Oh no, they have Robert or not.

5820
03:15:32,120 --> 03:15:33,280
Oh no, team nine got seven.

5821
03:15:33,620 --> 03:15:34,220
She was...

5822
03:15:34,220 --> 03:15:34,540
Okay, yeah.

5823
03:15:34,600 --> 03:15:35,140
Then they're up there.

5824
03:15:35,240 --> 03:15:35,840
Ashy posted.

5825
03:15:36,060 --> 03:15:36,260
Okay.

5826
03:15:36,340 --> 03:15:43,140
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

5827
03:15:43,780 --> 03:15:44,720
There's three more teams.

5828
03:15:44,780 --> 03:15:45,520
Guys, please.

5829
03:15:45,620 --> 03:15:46,500
Three more teams.

5830
03:15:46,560 --> 03:15:46,800
Quick.

5831
03:15:47,180 --> 03:15:48,440
Just post it.

5832
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:48,460
Guys, please.

5833
03:15:50,060 --> 03:15:52,560
Oh no, he already posted it 10 minutes ago.

5834
03:15:52,640 --> 03:15:53,040
Yeah, we won.

5835
03:15:53,400 --> 03:15:54,100
Oh, we did.

5836
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:56,720
None of us looked at the leaderboard.

5837
03:15:56,840 --> 03:15:57,460
He posted it.

5838
03:15:57,680 --> 03:15:57,780
Yeah.

5839
03:15:57,780 --> 03:15:58,160
No way.

5840
03:15:58,160 --> 03:15:59,180
He put it at TBD.

5841
03:15:59,960 --> 03:16:01,380
He puts TBD first.

5842
03:16:01,500 --> 03:16:02,520
In leaderboard.

5843
03:16:02,680 --> 03:16:02,820
Yeah.

5844
03:16:02,840 --> 03:16:03,460
Oh, did he edit it?

5845
03:16:03,520 --> 03:16:03,740
Yeah, yeah.

5846
03:16:03,740 --> 03:16:04,280
He edits it.

5847
03:16:04,820 --> 03:16:05,320
It's official.

5848
03:16:05,520 --> 03:16:06,180
It's official.

5849
03:16:06,420 --> 03:16:07,540
Wait, Cross is a bastard.

5850
03:16:07,680 --> 03:16:10,760
That could have been a 3K game if Cross didn't clutch up.

5851
03:16:11,040 --> 03:16:11,820
Oh my God.

5852
03:16:11,840 --> 03:16:12,020
I know.

5853
03:16:12,200 --> 03:16:12,300
Okay.

5854
03:16:12,640 --> 03:16:13,000
Yeah.

5855
03:16:13,660 --> 03:16:15,420
You said he was going to get a talking two.

5856
03:16:16,060 --> 03:16:17,000
Oh my God.

5857
03:16:17,380 --> 03:16:17,740
Okay.

5858
03:16:18,180 --> 03:16:19,560
I'm going to go with the Wait, was Cross the Watson?

5859
03:16:20,580 --> 03:16:21,620
He was a Cossack.

5860
03:16:21,800 --> 03:16:22,260
I'm the only one saying.

5861
03:16:22,280 --> 03:16:23,120
Who the fuck was on the Watson?

5862
03:16:24,740 --> 03:16:25,420
I have no idea.

5863
03:16:25,680 --> 03:16:26,440
We did it, guys.

5864
03:16:26,440 --> 03:16:27,040
Maybe he was the Watson.

5865
03:16:27,140 --> 03:16:27,520
I'm not sure.

5866
03:16:27,720 --> 03:16:29,200
We're taking home $1,000.

5867
03:16:29,900 --> 03:16:31,900
Maybe $2,000 if we rate...

5868
03:16:31,900 --> 03:16:33,280
We don't rate the clips.

5869
03:16:33,320 --> 03:16:33,980
So what are finals?

5870
03:16:34,160 --> 03:16:36,300
Is finals the same team as you played it?

5871
03:16:36,340 --> 03:16:37,220
Or did they get it?

5872
03:16:37,220 --> 03:16:37,480
I don't know.

5873
03:16:37,480 --> 03:16:37,800
It's random.

5874
03:16:37,800 --> 03:16:40,000
I think it's a whole new game format.

5875
03:16:40,220 --> 03:16:40,740
I understand.

5876
03:16:40,980 --> 03:16:41,240
Yeah.

5877
03:16:41,580 --> 03:16:42,820
It's random.

5878
03:16:43,460 --> 03:16:45,020
Because it's like different games.

5879
03:16:45,080 --> 03:16:47,280
It's like game modes from all three tournaments combined together.

5880
03:16:47,280 --> 03:16:47,880
And it's random.

5881
03:16:49,360 --> 03:16:51,180
The other ones seem too free to play.

5882
03:16:51,280 --> 03:16:52,500
And this one seems like the hardest one.

5883
03:16:52,620 --> 03:16:53,960
It's like actually still Cobb Apex.

5884
03:16:54,240 --> 03:16:58,900
Like the other two tournaments, it's like mini game, like hide and seek and stuff like that.

5885
03:16:59,040 --> 03:17:02,920
Well, Thursday is actual games though.

5886
03:17:03,060 --> 03:17:05,060
Because there's duos, team deathmatch, and control points.

5887
03:17:06,260 --> 03:17:06,660
Okay.

5888
03:17:07,140 --> 03:17:08,800
So that's the actual try-hards.

5889
03:17:09,120 --> 03:17:10,940
Those ones might be easier than these ones.

5890
03:17:11,080 --> 03:17:12,000
So when are the finals then?

5891
03:17:12,060 --> 03:17:13,140
What day is the finals?

5892
03:17:13,400 --> 03:17:14,700
The finals on 28th.

5893
03:17:14,700 --> 03:17:15,080
There's still two more.

5894
03:17:15,260 --> 03:17:15,660
Yeah.

5895
03:17:15,660 --> 03:17:16,440
There's two more weeks.

5896
03:17:17,120 --> 03:17:19,260
The finals itself is on the 28th.

5897
03:17:19,340 --> 03:17:22,720
The 14th and 21st are the invitation to the finals.

5898
03:17:24,240 --> 03:17:24,820
All right.

5899
03:17:24,820 --> 03:17:25,940
We did it.

5900
03:17:25,960 --> 03:17:26,820
We qualified, guys.

5901
03:17:26,900 --> 03:17:27,860
Now we just get to vibe.

5902
03:17:28,160 --> 03:17:29,020
Now we don't care.

5903
03:17:29,840 --> 03:17:30,720
Let's play for wins.

5904
03:17:30,940 --> 03:17:31,920
We can go for the win.

5905
03:17:32,020 --> 03:17:33,800
You can still go for most challenges.

5906
03:17:33,980 --> 03:17:36,340
The team got game two and three and they counted them for both.

5907
03:17:36,860 --> 03:17:38,520
So we can still play for...

5908
03:17:38,520 --> 03:17:40,160
It depends which one's easier.

5909
03:17:40,300 --> 03:17:43,680
We either play for the win for 1500 or we play for most challenges for 1500.

5910
03:17:43,860 --> 03:17:45,260
I think the challenges is easier.

5911
03:17:45,460 --> 03:17:45,580
Yeah.

5912
03:17:45,660 --> 03:17:46,380
The challenges are easier.

5913
03:17:46,380 --> 03:17:46,480
Okay.

5914
03:17:46,520 --> 03:17:47,460
If the win comes, it comes.

5915
03:17:47,700 --> 03:17:47,940
Yeah.

5916
03:17:48,040 --> 03:17:48,880
Let's just do the same thing.

5917
03:17:48,980 --> 03:17:50,240
Let's just go for most challenges again.

5918
03:17:50,520 --> 03:17:50,920
Perfect.

5919
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:53,160
We have a good game then Deb.

5920
03:17:54,180 --> 03:17:54,580
Perfect.

5921
03:17:54,640 --> 03:17:54,840
Perfect.

5922
03:17:54,900 --> 03:17:55,040
Yeah.

5923
03:17:57,060 --> 03:17:58,020
Got OCAT out.

5924
03:17:58,640 --> 03:17:59,600
My mic is muted.

5925
03:17:59,780 --> 03:18:00,920
My push-talk doesn't work.

5926
03:18:02,860 --> 03:18:03,980
My discard just break.

5927
03:18:07,500 --> 03:18:08,320
We did it.

5928
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:10,000
We got one win.

5929
03:18:10,180 --> 03:18:11,420
That was my only goal.

5930
03:18:14,240 --> 03:18:15,300
You have to drop us.

5931
03:18:15,320 --> 03:18:15,640
Mikey, please.

5932
03:18:15,640 --> 03:18:15,720
Oh, shit.

5933
03:18:15,720 --> 03:18:16,080
My keyboard doesn't work.

5934
03:18:16,220 --> 03:18:16,840
Oh shit.

5935
03:18:16,840 --> 03:18:17,060
Wait.

5936
03:18:17,180 --> 03:18:17,360
Okay.

5937
03:18:17,440 --> 03:18:17,880
Never mind.

5938
03:18:18,120 --> 03:18:21,760
Are you lying to me?

5939
03:18:22,160 --> 03:18:22,540
No.

5940
03:18:22,680 --> 03:18:22,940
No.

5941
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:23,160
No.

5942
03:18:23,300 --> 03:18:24,260
I don't believe you.

5943
03:18:24,260 --> 03:18:26,060
I thought pro players have like four...

5944
03:18:26,060 --> 03:18:26,580
I'm good.

5945
03:18:26,580 --> 03:18:26,860
I'm good.

5946
03:18:26,880 --> 03:18:27,040
I'm good.

5947
03:18:27,300 --> 03:18:27,920
It's good.

5948
03:18:28,120 --> 03:18:29,920
Oh, just stretch.

5949
03:18:30,040 --> 03:18:30,400
Just stretch.

5950
03:18:30,480 --> 03:18:31,540
It's okay.

5951
03:18:32,700 --> 03:18:33,420
That's all right.

5952
03:18:33,660 --> 03:18:34,800
We can just run to it.

5953
03:18:34,860 --> 03:18:35,220
Just stretch it.

5954
03:18:35,340 --> 03:18:35,820
There's no way.

5955
03:18:36,300 --> 03:18:37,580
We could take the grab can.

5956
03:18:38,400 --> 03:18:38,780
Oh.

5957
03:18:39,420 --> 03:18:39,800
Okay.

5958
03:18:39,900 --> 03:18:40,200
Don't worry.

5959
03:18:40,300 --> 03:18:41,340
I'll pretend I crashed my game.

5960
03:18:43,660 --> 03:18:45,720
I might have to take this gravity cannon, no lie.

5961
03:18:46,300 --> 03:18:47,980
Okay, I'm like... No, no, no, it's fine.

5962
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:48,240
It's fine.

5963
03:18:48,240 --> 03:18:48,880
We'll stretch, we'll stretch.

5964
03:18:48,960 --> 03:18:49,480
Oh, fuck.

5965
03:18:49,660 --> 03:18:50,520
Okay, now I... You can stretch.

5966
03:18:50,540 --> 03:18:50,920
You can stretch.

5967
03:18:50,920 --> 03:18:52,060
Okay, now I guess I'll stretch too.

5968
03:18:52,420 --> 03:18:52,700
You can stretch.

5969
03:18:52,700 --> 03:18:53,560
I'm so sorry, guys.

5970
03:18:53,700 --> 03:18:55,000
I thought it was just... I am not...

5971
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:55,280
No, it's fine.

5972
03:18:55,340 --> 03:18:55,520
It's fine.

5973
03:18:55,580 --> 03:18:56,880
We loot the... We loot the P.O.I.

5974
03:18:56,880 --> 03:18:58,500
and then we loot back to the prowlers when we do PvE.

5975
03:18:58,740 --> 03:19:01,700
I just want you to know I have not fucking stretched in a long time.

5976
03:19:02,280 --> 03:19:02,560
Yay.

5977
03:19:03,580 --> 03:19:04,540
You should do that, you know.

5978
03:19:04,560 --> 03:19:06,600
Sitting at a computer all day is bad for you.

5979
03:19:06,640 --> 03:19:07,100
No, that's it.

5980
03:19:07,220 --> 03:19:07,940
I'll just die young.

5981
03:19:08,960 --> 03:19:09,240
No.

5982
03:19:09,320 --> 03:19:10,080
But not too young.

5983
03:19:10,180 --> 03:19:10,760
Not too young.

5984
03:19:10,760 --> 03:19:11,720
I'm rehabilitated.

5985
03:19:11,900 --> 03:19:12,220
I go therapy now.

5986
03:19:12,220 --> 03:19:14,920
If we get a good zone, we might just play for Godspot and play for the WEN.

5987
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:17,260
Because they're both even at this point.

5988
03:19:17,480 --> 03:19:18,340
Oh, we got a good zone.

5989
03:19:18,420 --> 03:19:18,960
You should go hit Beacon.

5990
03:19:19,160 --> 03:19:19,480
Okay.

5991
03:19:24,380 --> 03:19:26,040
Oh my god, I got too excited, guys.

5992
03:19:27,180 --> 03:19:28,500
I'll go hit the Beacon.

5993
03:19:31,440 --> 03:19:32,140
I think it's Sentinel.

5994
03:19:32,260 --> 03:19:33,300
I'm gonna go for the Sentinel knock.

5995
03:19:33,560 --> 03:19:34,320
I got a Mosi.

5996
03:19:36,140 --> 03:19:37,180
I'm gonna steal your loot.

5997
03:19:38,580 --> 03:19:40,500
We can loot through the bunker on the way if it's pulling well.

5998
03:19:40,540 --> 03:19:42,720
Wait, was... was the P20...

5999
03:19:43,580 --> 03:19:43,900
P20.

6000
03:19:43,960 --> 03:19:44,600
P20 knock, Mosi.

6001
03:19:44,680 --> 03:19:44,960
I'm knocked.

6002
03:19:45,100 --> 03:19:46,080
Okay, I got a P20.

6003
03:19:46,580 --> 03:19:47,400
I got this.

6004
03:19:48,160 --> 03:19:49,540
You can be free, He-me-one.

6005
03:19:50,060 --> 03:19:51,180
You wanna stick 48 for that Sentinel?

6006
03:19:51,540 --> 03:19:52,800
We can be free now.

6007
03:19:52,980 --> 03:19:54,020
It has to be Ironside, I think.

6008
03:19:54,600 --> 03:19:55,320
Oh, shit.

6009
03:19:55,400 --> 03:19:55,700
Yeah.

6010
03:20:00,900 --> 03:20:01,260
Yay!

6011
03:20:01,640 --> 03:20:02,000
Nice!

6012
03:20:02,560 --> 03:20:04,320
I think we just play our game still.

6013
03:20:04,420 --> 03:20:04,840
I'm not gonna lie.

6014
03:20:04,860 --> 03:20:06,080
I don't think we'll get Godspot this game.

6015
03:20:07,940 --> 03:20:08,900
I got a bat.

6016
03:20:09,100 --> 03:20:10,160
Wait, where do I loot?

6017
03:20:11,040 --> 03:20:12,360
We go... we can go loot the bunker.

6018
03:20:12,500 --> 03:20:13,640
You guys loot everything.

6019
03:20:15,280 --> 03:20:17,200
One person's supposed to get the bunker, but...

6020
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:18,600
Yeah, I guess I'll go to the bunker.

6021
03:20:19,340 --> 03:20:20,640
There's no more loot here.

6022
03:20:24,120 --> 03:20:25,220
I'll grab this, too.

6023
03:20:26,080 --> 03:20:26,980
Ping me a Mosi.

6024
03:20:27,500 --> 03:20:28,420
Unless you have one already.

6025
03:20:28,620 --> 03:20:29,400
I have a Mosi.

6026
03:20:29,520 --> 03:20:30,380
I only have a P20.

6027
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:34,200
I have a Thermite, too.

6028
03:20:34,320 --> 03:20:35,680
Should I just come on and do it?

6029
03:20:35,720 --> 03:20:36,240
Oh, yeah.

6030
03:20:36,240 --> 03:20:36,760
We can do that.

6031
03:20:36,860 --> 03:20:37,700
We should do that right now.

6032
03:20:37,720 --> 03:20:38,840
You should do the one-person thing.

6033
03:20:39,220 --> 03:20:40,780
I'm grabbing this Evo Harvester quick, yeah.

6034
03:20:40,780 --> 03:20:40,940
Okay.

6035
03:20:41,740 --> 03:20:42,660
We do need to be careful.

6036
03:20:42,740 --> 03:20:43,620
The Zeus Station team is gonna be...

6037
03:20:43,620 --> 03:20:44,080
They're gonna come down.

6038
03:20:44,860 --> 03:20:45,460
Oh, wait.

6039
03:20:45,540 --> 03:20:45,860
What the fuck?

6040
03:20:46,300 --> 03:20:46,940
I'm ready.

6041
03:20:47,180 --> 03:20:47,260
I'm ready.

6042
03:20:47,280 --> 03:20:47,620
I'm good.

6043
03:20:49,980 --> 03:20:52,720
Oh, I actually think we might just go to zone here.

6044
03:20:54,120 --> 03:20:55,500
I think it's just gonna be pulling down here.

6045
03:20:55,620 --> 03:20:56,400
Oh, here's a Mosi.

6046
03:20:57,620 --> 03:20:58,400
I have one.

6047
03:21:01,920 --> 03:21:03,920
Let's go loot down to the tunnel and go to zone.

6048
03:21:04,120 --> 03:21:04,420
All right.

6049
03:21:05,440 --> 03:21:06,000
Oh, wait.

6050
03:21:06,040 --> 03:21:06,280
The heart.

6051
03:21:06,900 --> 03:21:08,300
I just told you we're not doing tunnels.

6052
03:21:08,300 --> 03:21:09,160
You can do the heart right now while you're waiting for us.

6053
03:21:09,520 --> 03:21:09,840
Yeah.

6054
03:21:09,860 --> 03:21:11,040
No, I don't think so.

6055
03:21:11,260 --> 03:21:11,640
All right.

6056
03:21:11,720 --> 03:21:12,640
I don't have a long range.

6057
03:21:12,640 --> 03:21:14,380
Can we do the Thermite one real quick here?

6058
03:21:14,500 --> 03:21:15,640
Yeah, we can do it inside.

6059
03:21:16,240 --> 03:21:16,640
All right.

6060
03:21:16,980 --> 03:21:18,480
While you do that, I'll make the heart then.

6061
03:21:22,040 --> 03:21:22,880
I'm gonna go scout spot.

6062
03:21:23,080 --> 03:21:23,580
Just be careful.

6063
03:21:23,640 --> 03:21:24,740
This team doesn't want to walk up behind.

6064
03:21:24,760 --> 03:21:24,960
Here, Senox, you do it.

6065
03:21:25,220 --> 03:21:25,760
Wait, I'll do it.

6066
03:21:25,780 --> 03:21:26,140
I'll do it.

6067
03:21:26,460 --> 03:21:27,040
I'll do it here.

6068
03:21:27,340 --> 03:21:28,120
I have one too.

6069
03:21:28,440 --> 03:21:28,780
I'll do it.

6070
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:30,840
You can just res me and Senox can scout.

6071
03:21:31,040 --> 03:21:31,260
All right.

6072
03:21:31,540 --> 03:21:32,780
Yeah, I wanna go scout spot.

6073
03:21:32,980 --> 03:21:33,440
Yeah, let him scout.

6074
03:21:35,160 --> 03:21:36,060
You have a Mosi, right?

6075
03:21:36,180 --> 03:21:36,920
I don't need to pick one up.

6076
03:21:37,160 --> 03:21:37,780
Yeah, I have one.

6077
03:21:37,820 --> 03:21:38,080
You're good.

6078
03:21:38,340 --> 03:21:38,780
Okay, perfect.

6079
03:21:40,620 --> 03:21:40,980
All right.

6080
03:21:41,020 --> 03:21:41,920
We got the Thermite.

6081
03:21:42,340 --> 03:21:42,620
All right.

6082
03:21:43,120 --> 03:21:43,900
I have shoots.

6083
03:21:44,160 --> 03:21:44,520
Shoots.

6084
03:21:44,540 --> 03:21:45,100
We're fighting up here.

6085
03:21:45,140 --> 03:21:45,980
We might third this.

6086
03:21:46,140 --> 03:21:47,260
Okay, I need to heal though.

6087
03:21:47,380 --> 03:21:47,940
Give me a sec.

6088
03:21:48,040 --> 03:21:48,360
Yeah, you're good.

6089
03:21:50,140 --> 03:21:52,180
Can Mosi take the disruptors or the hammers?

6090
03:21:52,440 --> 03:21:53,580
Just hammers.

6091
03:21:53,580 --> 03:21:53,960
Just hammers.

6092
03:21:54,020 --> 03:21:54,580
Okay, okay.

6093
03:21:55,680 --> 03:21:59,700
All right, let me see if I can...

6094
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:00,380
I got the heart.

6095
03:22:00,640 --> 03:22:01,340
Heart, heart, heart.

6096
03:22:01,520 --> 03:22:01,900
Heart's done.

6097
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:03,240
Beautiful.

6098
03:22:03,240 --> 03:22:03,740
Coming over.

6099
03:22:04,340 --> 03:22:05,560
I'm gonna come up and scout the booster.

6100
03:22:07,760 --> 03:22:08,900
No third on that party?

6101
03:22:09,480 --> 03:22:10,320
No, they're not fighting.

6102
03:22:10,440 --> 03:22:10,760
They're not fighting.

6103
03:22:10,900 --> 03:22:11,120
All right.

6104
03:22:11,520 --> 03:22:12,600
Where do we chill?

6105
03:22:13,300 --> 03:22:14,100
I'm gonna hit the booster.

6106
03:22:14,220 --> 03:22:15,000
Let me see if it's safe.

6107
03:22:15,500 --> 03:22:16,600
Okay, we'll just wait then.

6108
03:22:17,520 --> 03:22:18,120
You're good.

6109
03:22:18,140 --> 03:22:18,520
You can take it.

6110
03:22:18,680 --> 03:22:19,840
All right, we can take it back.

6111
03:22:20,040 --> 03:22:21,020
All of us too.

6112
03:22:23,880 --> 03:22:25,620
So, you mean I will take it back and forth?

6113
03:22:27,720 --> 03:22:28,520
Only one of us.

6114
03:22:28,600 --> 03:22:29,660
Okay, one...

6115
03:22:30,380 --> 03:22:31,140
I'll take it back.

6116
03:22:31,480 --> 03:22:32,120
That was one, two, three.

6117
03:22:32,120 --> 03:22:32,900
Let's just all take it together.

6118
03:22:33,080 --> 03:22:34,180
Let's all take it together and come back.

6119
03:22:34,820 --> 03:22:37,100
Just pray there's nobody capping this and then we go for a spot.

6120
03:22:39,240 --> 03:22:40,920
Are we doing these prowlers here or no?

6121
03:22:41,300 --> 03:22:42,420
No, it depends.

6122
03:22:42,620 --> 03:22:44,120
We're gonna rip a valkal.

6123
03:22:44,180 --> 03:22:45,660
Then if Godspot's open, we're gonna go to zone.

6124
03:22:45,760 --> 03:22:46,560
If not, we can do prowlers.

6125
03:22:46,820 --> 03:22:47,080
All right.

6126
03:22:47,580 --> 03:22:47,900
Yeah.

6127
03:22:50,820 --> 03:22:52,560
Okay, just land on me and we're gonna valkal.

6128
03:22:52,860 --> 03:22:53,980
How many bats do you guys have?

6129
03:22:54,020 --> 03:22:54,500
I have three.

6130
03:22:54,560 --> 03:22:55,000
I have two.

6131
03:22:55,100 --> 03:22:55,420
I have zero.

6132
03:22:55,640 --> 03:22:56,540
I have zero.

6133
03:22:56,940 --> 03:22:58,340
I'll just drop you one just anyways.

6134
03:22:58,580 --> 03:22:58,900
Here.

6135
03:22:59,780 --> 03:23:00,540
Just hold it for now.

6136
03:23:00,580 --> 03:23:01,040
Just hold it for now.

6137
03:23:01,860 --> 03:23:02,180
Oh.

6138
03:23:03,440 --> 03:23:04,480
All right, valkal.

6139
03:23:05,120 --> 03:23:05,540
All right.

6140
03:23:05,920 --> 03:23:06,360
Number one.

6141
03:23:06,480 --> 03:23:06,820
We want this.

6142
03:23:06,820 --> 03:23:08,180
We want this or the back building.

6143
03:23:08,280 --> 03:23:08,680
Look at both of them.

6144
03:23:08,840 --> 03:23:09,160
All right.

6145
03:23:09,160 --> 03:23:09,280
Okay.

6146
03:23:10,780 --> 03:23:11,100
I'm gonna go.

6147
03:23:11,100 --> 03:23:12,980
Can we do the lifeline package yet or no?

6148
03:23:13,320 --> 03:23:13,720
No.

6149
03:23:13,860 --> 03:23:16,040
I popped the ulti-excel but it wasn't up.

6150
03:23:16,040 --> 03:23:17,020
Is anybody over here?

6151
03:23:17,180 --> 03:23:17,520
To our right.

6152
03:23:17,600 --> 03:23:17,880
To our right.

6153
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:18,680
Nobody there.

6154
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:19,740
We're going for this.

6155
03:23:19,800 --> 03:23:20,200
We're going for this.

6156
03:23:21,980 --> 03:23:23,020
There's a harvester.

6157
03:23:23,020 --> 03:23:23,380
Is that a harvester?

6158
03:23:23,580 --> 03:23:23,940
Yeah.

6159
03:23:24,020 --> 03:23:28,240
Just keep moving forward because this team might die because I want to get this cluster of buildings if we can.

6160
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:29,440
Okay.

6161
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:31,840
It's either gonna end on us or those buildings.

6162
03:23:34,140 --> 03:23:34,720
I'm here.

6163
03:23:36,320 --> 03:23:37,220
This got looted.

6164
03:23:37,480 --> 03:23:38,600
Does someone grab this?

6165
03:23:39,460 --> 03:23:40,100
Yeah, I'll grab it.

6166
03:23:40,680 --> 03:23:41,080
I'll grab it.

6167
03:23:41,100 --> 03:23:42,200
There's people on the animal.

6168
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:44,560
I don't know what it's called.

6169
03:23:44,740 --> 03:23:45,300
The monster.

6170
03:23:45,300 --> 03:23:46,000
Are we on these buildings?

6171
03:23:46,200 --> 03:23:46,360
Down B.

6172
03:23:46,460 --> 03:23:47,840
No, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's.

6173
03:23:47,860 --> 03:23:48,140
There's a team there.

6174
03:23:48,180 --> 03:23:48,260
Okay.

6175
03:23:49,240 --> 03:23:50,100
Somebody on the...

6176
03:23:50,100 --> 03:23:50,580
Flush.

6177
03:23:50,980 --> 03:23:51,480
I don't have...

6178
03:23:51,480 --> 03:23:53,460
Let's set up fences and we're gonna hold all this.

6179
03:23:53,540 --> 03:23:54,820
This bunker and that bunker.

6180
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:55,240
All right.

6181
03:23:55,280 --> 03:23:57,040
Let's set up behind us and make sure nobody pushes us.

6182
03:23:57,280 --> 03:23:57,560
Okay.

6183
03:23:57,600 --> 03:23:58,100
I'm setting up.

6184
03:23:59,000 --> 03:23:59,640
Anyone fast?

6185
03:24:01,960 --> 03:24:03,020
Want me to set up...

6186
03:24:03,020 --> 03:24:04,400
How do you want me to set up fences here?

6187
03:24:04,580 --> 03:24:06,520
You just spam them so people know we're here.

6188
03:24:06,560 --> 03:24:07,560
It doesn't have to be anything crazy.

6189
03:24:08,580 --> 03:24:09,240
We're here.

6190
03:24:09,800 --> 03:24:11,420
This one fence so you know.

6191
03:24:11,820 --> 03:24:12,180
Okay.

6192
03:24:12,380 --> 03:24:12,740
We're here.

6193
03:24:12,740 --> 03:24:15,860
If we start getting shot in the back and we can't hold this, we just slide down and put the bunker.

6194
03:24:16,420 --> 03:24:16,740
Okay.

6195
03:24:17,240 --> 03:24:17,560
Yeah.

6196
03:24:17,840 --> 03:24:18,840
Don't come over here.

6197
03:24:19,400 --> 03:24:21,720
You could, you could call in your pack now, by the way, if you want.

6198
03:24:21,800 --> 03:24:22,440
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6199
03:24:22,440 --> 03:24:22,740
Of course.

6200
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:24,520
And Jen as well.

6201
03:24:24,660 --> 03:24:25,460
We're in...

6202
03:24:25,800 --> 03:24:26,980
I wanna put more fences here.

6203
03:24:26,980 --> 03:24:28,760
You can Jen in the middle of nowhere.

6204
03:24:28,880 --> 03:24:29,120
In the bunker probably.

6205
03:24:29,520 --> 03:24:29,840
Whoa.

6206
03:24:30,380 --> 03:24:30,700
Chill.

6207
03:24:34,260 --> 03:24:34,580
Whoa.

6208
03:24:35,060 --> 03:24:36,260
Hit your shots first, man.

6209
03:24:36,680 --> 03:24:37,980
You have a gold mag on the sniper.

6210
03:24:40,480 --> 03:24:42,520
So wait, let me open up the thing really quick.

6211
03:24:42,740 --> 03:24:43,460
Is it a no scope?

6212
03:24:43,840 --> 03:24:45,020
Knock with sentinel.

6213
03:24:45,300 --> 03:24:45,320
No scope.

6214
03:24:45,880 --> 03:24:46,820
I'm looking at an old one.

6215
03:24:48,140 --> 03:24:50,780
Does anyone have it open or should I tap out and go get it?

6216
03:24:50,820 --> 03:24:51,220
I have it open.

6217
03:24:51,320 --> 03:24:51,600
I have it open.

6218
03:24:51,900 --> 03:24:52,320
Is it...

6219
03:24:52,320 --> 03:24:52,680
What is it?

6220
03:24:52,700 --> 03:24:53,980
It's a no scope with sentinel and a...

6221
03:24:53,980 --> 03:24:54,780
No scope irons.

6222
03:24:54,780 --> 03:24:54,960
Yeah.

6223
03:24:55,060 --> 03:24:55,620
Sentinel knock.

6224
03:24:55,660 --> 03:24:56,660
It can be charged up though.

6225
03:24:56,700 --> 03:24:56,760
And a 360.

6226
03:24:57,140 --> 03:24:59,420
And a 360 no scope with sniper.

6227
03:24:59,880 --> 03:25:00,500
I'll play for those.

6228
03:25:00,500 --> 03:25:01,000
I'll play for those, I guess.

6229
03:25:01,220 --> 03:25:01,980
Oh, you're nuts.

6230
03:25:02,260 --> 03:25:02,740
All right.

6231
03:25:02,780 --> 03:25:02,960
Let's see.

6232
03:25:03,380 --> 03:25:06,400
Can you Jen just in this trench right here?

6233
03:25:06,560 --> 03:25:06,740
Yeah.

6234
03:25:07,240 --> 03:25:07,920
Just like right here?

6235
03:25:08,100 --> 03:25:08,240
Yeah.

6236
03:25:08,340 --> 03:25:08,640
All right.

6237
03:25:08,700 --> 03:25:08,980
Yeah.

6238
03:25:12,740 --> 03:25:14,240
So, if someone catches us, be careful.

6239
03:25:14,340 --> 03:25:16,400
If you hear a valk ult, they might oob on top of us.

6240
03:25:16,520 --> 03:25:17,560
So, we just gotta be careful for that.

6241
03:25:17,560 --> 03:25:17,600
All right.

6242
03:25:17,600 --> 03:25:17,820
That's fine.

6243
03:25:18,120 --> 03:25:18,540
Don't worry.

6244
03:25:18,660 --> 03:25:19,300
I have fences here.

6245
03:25:19,520 --> 03:25:20,500
It looks dangerous.

6246
03:25:20,740 --> 03:25:23,720
I know it doesn't matter now, but I want you guys to know we actually had 13.

6247
03:25:24,600 --> 03:25:24,920
Whoa.

6248
03:25:25,480 --> 03:25:25,800
Wait.

6249
03:25:25,980 --> 03:25:26,820
How did we get 13?

6250
03:25:26,880 --> 03:25:30,780
Because we got seven or more kills as a team and we got 10 or more kills as a team.

6251
03:25:31,020 --> 03:25:31,340
Whoa.

6252
03:25:32,860 --> 03:25:33,180
Yeah.

6253
03:25:33,220 --> 03:25:33,460
Yeah.

6254
03:25:33,520 --> 03:25:33,620
Yeah.

6255
03:25:33,620 --> 03:25:33,840
Nice.

6256
03:25:34,700 --> 03:25:36,920
So, we could have been like, no, no, no.

6257
03:25:37,220 --> 03:25:38,180
We got 13.

6258
03:25:38,920 --> 03:25:39,240
Yeah.

6259
03:25:39,260 --> 03:25:39,500
I just realized.

6260
03:25:39,500 --> 03:25:41,620
There's a small chance this pulls back the checkpoint, honestly.

6261
03:25:42,020 --> 03:25:42,620
Hopefully it does.

6262
03:25:43,300 --> 03:25:43,700
Yeah.

6263
03:25:43,700 --> 03:25:44,860
Oh, man.

6264
03:25:45,020 --> 03:25:45,440
You know what?

6265
03:25:45,600 --> 03:25:46,520
It's not looking good.

6266
03:25:46,680 --> 03:25:47,340
That's good for overall.

6267
03:25:47,340 --> 03:25:48,020
What if it's like down here?

6268
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:48,940
Most challenges.

6269
03:25:49,380 --> 03:25:50,060
That's good for us.

6270
03:25:50,060 --> 03:25:50,180
Oh, yeah.

6271
03:25:50,180 --> 03:25:50,380
True.

6272
03:25:50,540 --> 03:25:51,880
Is that a prize?

6273
03:25:52,120 --> 03:25:52,340
Yeah.

6274
03:25:52,380 --> 03:25:52,520
Yeah.

6275
03:25:52,580 --> 03:25:54,320
Most challenges completed per team.

6276
03:25:57,390 --> 03:25:58,970
How many bats do you have?

6277
03:25:59,390 --> 03:26:01,590
I have two plus a Phoenix kit.

6278
03:26:01,690 --> 03:26:02,050
I was gonna give you one.

6279
03:26:02,050 --> 03:26:02,250
That's not.

6280
03:26:02,350 --> 03:26:02,510
Yeah.

6281
03:26:02,510 --> 03:26:02,670
Let me get one.

6282
03:26:02,930 --> 03:26:03,410
I'm good.

6283
03:26:04,010 --> 03:26:04,770
I'm dokey.

6284
03:26:04,970 --> 03:26:06,230
Should I just rip mine?

6285
03:26:06,230 --> 03:26:06,630
Whoa.

6286
03:26:06,650 --> 03:26:07,670
I'm getting shot at.

6287
03:26:08,130 --> 03:26:08,530
Wait.

6288
03:26:08,530 --> 03:26:09,350
Just the person across.

6289
03:26:09,930 --> 03:26:12,250
Do you have poke to get the purple or no?

6290
03:26:13,610 --> 03:26:14,470
For lifeline packs?

6291
03:26:14,990 --> 03:26:16,410
No, I have a flat line.

6292
03:26:16,570 --> 03:26:16,910
But I can try.

6293
03:26:16,930 --> 03:26:17,230
Okay.

6294
03:26:17,230 --> 03:26:17,570
That's fine.

6295
03:26:17,750 --> 03:26:17,990
That's fine.

6296
03:26:17,990 --> 03:26:18,230
We play.

6297
03:26:18,250 --> 03:26:19,570
I don't want any waste suck.

6298
03:26:19,710 --> 03:26:20,690
I'm gonna use my gen.

6299
03:26:26,710 --> 03:26:28,290
I don't have any poke at all.

6300
03:26:28,590 --> 03:26:30,370
Is Sentinel here for more ammo?

6301
03:26:30,950 --> 03:26:32,870
There's a blue bolt on this if you sell the mozone.

6302
03:26:33,330 --> 03:26:34,330
I got one on my.

6303
03:26:34,990 --> 03:26:35,610
Thank you.

6304
03:26:38,590 --> 03:26:39,770
This guy is very cringe.

6305
03:26:40,030 --> 03:26:40,670
This guy.

6306
03:26:41,110 --> 03:26:42,190
Actually, get a hobby.

6307
03:26:42,730 --> 03:26:43,510
You know what?

6308
03:26:44,030 --> 03:26:44,510
Come on.

6309
03:26:46,930 --> 03:26:47,950
Who's docking from a mozone?

6310
03:26:48,790 --> 03:26:49,370
I'm gonna go get some over here.

6311
03:26:49,430 --> 03:26:50,870
The North pad.

6312
03:26:51,290 --> 03:26:54,630
Could you put just a couple fences down on like our roof so people see them?

6313
03:26:54,690 --> 03:26:54,890
Oh, yeah.

6314
03:26:54,890 --> 03:26:55,490
So they're not blind.

6315
03:26:56,390 --> 03:27:03,390
I'm gonna take these fences away and then I'll put on the roof.

6316
03:27:04,190 --> 03:27:05,990
We're playing just for the win this game.

6317
03:27:06,090 --> 03:27:07,950
I don't think we've done enough to get the overall challenges.

6318
03:27:08,730 --> 03:27:09,430
Yeah, we don't.

6319
03:27:09,610 --> 03:27:10,390
We need...

6320
03:27:10,390 --> 03:27:12,410
I need two more care packs to consider it.

6321
03:27:12,430 --> 03:27:13,270
Three ults.

6322
03:27:13,830 --> 03:27:14,470
Two more packs.

6323
03:27:14,470 --> 03:27:16,570
I could just revoke alt and count this too.

6324
03:27:17,230 --> 03:27:17,850
You could.

6325
03:27:17,930 --> 03:27:18,270
You could.

6326
03:27:18,690 --> 03:27:19,450
I'm just gonna do...

6327
03:27:19,450 --> 03:27:20,930
I'm literally just gonna revoke alt and come back down.

6328
03:27:21,090 --> 03:27:23,490
I wish we could do the PVs.

6329
03:27:23,750 --> 03:27:25,270
Yeah, I don't think we can at this point.

6330
03:27:25,350 --> 03:27:26,030
I don't think we can.

6331
03:27:26,150 --> 03:27:26,330
Yeah.

6332
03:27:26,390 --> 03:27:27,590
We probably could have done...

6333
03:27:27,590 --> 03:27:28,910
We definitely could have done the other one.

6334
03:27:28,990 --> 03:27:33,110
I honestly assumed someone would take zone to be honest, but...

6335
03:27:34,370 --> 03:27:34,910
Arc star.

6336
03:27:35,010 --> 03:27:35,870
Arc star on the car.

6337
03:27:35,970 --> 03:27:36,070
No.

6338
03:27:36,070 --> 03:27:37,690
Get ready for them to land on our roof.

6339
03:27:37,750 --> 03:27:38,570
They just popped the...

6340
03:27:38,570 --> 03:27:38,870
Okay.

6341
03:27:38,950 --> 03:27:40,170
Just look up.

6342
03:27:40,370 --> 03:27:41,710
We have a team rotating towards us.

6343
03:27:42,070 --> 03:27:42,650
I'm coming over.

6344
03:27:42,910 --> 03:27:43,710
I'm gonna look above us.

6345
03:27:43,750 --> 03:27:44,150
We're good.

6346
03:27:44,210 --> 03:27:44,930
They're not gonna stun us yet.

6347
03:27:45,190 --> 03:27:45,510
70.

6348
03:27:45,550 --> 03:27:45,790
Hold on.

6349
03:27:46,230 --> 03:27:46,550
I'm gonna look above us.

6350
03:27:46,550 --> 03:27:47,170
I'm here.

6351
03:27:49,130 --> 03:27:49,690
They won't.

6352
03:27:49,690 --> 03:27:50,310
My fences are scary.

6353
03:27:50,310 --> 03:27:50,870
They might just hold this.

6354
03:27:50,990 --> 03:27:52,190
They might just hold that bunker there.

6355
03:27:53,130 --> 03:27:53,770
They won't.

6356
03:27:53,770 --> 03:27:54,730
My fences are scary.

6357
03:27:55,850 --> 03:27:56,170
Yeah.

6358
03:27:56,270 --> 03:27:57,070
I think they're just in there.

6359
03:27:58,310 --> 03:27:58,630
Turtling.

6360
03:27:59,070 --> 03:27:59,670
Arc one right here.

6361
03:28:00,750 --> 03:28:01,070
Okay.

6362
03:28:01,750 --> 03:28:02,250
I'm looking.

6363
03:28:03,570 --> 03:28:04,210
I cannot...

6364
03:28:04,210 --> 03:28:06,350
I don't have any scopes or range for anything.

6365
03:28:07,010 --> 03:28:07,790
I might be able to get you one here.

6366
03:28:07,830 --> 03:28:08,810
Do you need a one or two?

6367
03:28:08,910 --> 03:28:09,470
I have it on a probably.

6368
03:28:09,990 --> 03:28:10,310
Yeah.

6369
03:28:10,390 --> 03:28:10,890
That would be great.

6370
03:28:12,610 --> 03:28:14,350
I'll need that for my P20 later too.

6371
03:28:15,650 --> 03:28:16,010
All right.

6372
03:28:16,210 --> 03:28:16,530
I'm gonna go.

6373
03:28:16,550 --> 03:28:17,070
Wait.

6374
03:28:17,150 --> 03:28:17,350
Oh.

6375
03:28:17,490 --> 03:28:18,290
What the fuck?

6376
03:28:18,530 --> 03:28:18,890
Chill.

6377
03:28:19,650 --> 03:28:22,690
I'm gonna charge up my armor for free.

6378
03:28:26,860 --> 03:28:27,800
Purple shotgun bolt.

6379
03:28:27,980 --> 03:28:28,400
Primo's on.

6380
03:28:28,580 --> 03:28:28,720
Yeah.

6381
03:28:28,720 --> 03:28:29,060
I got it.

6382
03:28:30,600 --> 03:28:31,140
I'm good.

6383
03:28:31,860 --> 03:28:32,620
Oh, I knocked Watson.

6384
03:28:32,620 --> 03:28:32,920
Right here.

6385
03:28:32,920 --> 03:28:33,360
Nice knock.

6386
03:28:33,400 --> 03:28:33,740
Nice knock.

6387
03:28:33,940 --> 03:28:34,100
Focal.

6388
03:28:34,180 --> 03:28:34,300
Focal.

6389
03:28:34,320 --> 03:28:34,440
Focal.

6390
03:28:34,620 --> 03:28:34,660
Focal.

6391
03:28:34,860 --> 03:28:35,220
Focal.

6392
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:36,280
Focal.

6393
03:28:36,280 --> 03:28:36,320
Flesh.

6394
03:28:36,540 --> 03:28:36,660
Oh.

6395
03:28:36,660 --> 03:28:37,140
They...

6396
03:28:37,880 --> 03:28:38,760
I'm gonna walk up a little bit.

6397
03:28:38,820 --> 03:28:40,000
I might be able to kill...

6398
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:40,100
Yeah.

6399
03:28:40,100 --> 03:28:40,320
Actually, no.

6400
03:28:40,400 --> 03:28:40,580
No.

6401
03:28:40,640 --> 03:28:40,720
No.

6402
03:28:40,720 --> 03:28:41,880
I might die here.

6403
03:28:41,900 --> 03:28:42,240
Just cutting this.

6404
03:28:42,340 --> 03:28:42,480
Bad idea.

6405
03:28:42,620 --> 03:28:43,100
Bad idea.

6406
03:28:43,700 --> 03:28:44,580
Too many people.

6407
03:28:44,640 --> 03:28:45,220
Too many people.

6408
03:28:46,380 --> 03:28:47,600
I'm gonna pop a Phoenix.

6409
03:28:47,880 --> 03:28:49,520
My Watson also have charge.

6410
03:28:49,800 --> 03:28:50,020
Yeah.

6411
03:28:50,220 --> 03:28:50,500
Yeah.

6412
03:28:50,540 --> 03:28:50,960
I'm gonna hop on it.

6413
03:28:53,020 --> 03:28:53,300
Oh.

6414
03:28:53,340 --> 03:28:54,460
He was so close too.

6415
03:28:55,800 --> 03:28:56,860
Could you drone?

6416
03:29:00,100 --> 03:29:00,380
Yeah.

6417
03:29:00,380 --> 03:29:00,680
I got you.

6418
03:29:00,740 --> 03:29:01,040
I think I'm gonna push.

6419
03:29:02,140 --> 03:29:02,680
Thank you.

6420
03:29:02,800 --> 03:29:02,960
Oh.

6421
03:29:02,960 --> 03:29:03,380
We're still in zone.

6422
03:29:03,540 --> 03:29:03,820
Nice.

6423
03:29:04,520 --> 03:29:08,620
It's probably gonna be this cluster of buildings, but if we clear our edge, we should have a free walk-in.

6424
03:29:08,840 --> 03:29:11,440
So we just have to win this fight on this team that pushes us on our edge.

6425
03:29:11,500 --> 03:29:11,600
Yeah.

6426
03:29:11,940 --> 03:29:13,800
I'm worried there's gonna be a team coming from behind.

6427
03:29:13,800 --> 03:29:14,240
We should be...

6428
03:29:14,240 --> 03:29:15,920
It should be pretty hard for them to push us.

6429
03:29:15,980 --> 03:29:16,980
This team should help us.

6430
03:29:17,040 --> 03:29:17,840
So we LOS left.

6431
03:29:18,160 --> 03:29:18,560
All right.

6432
03:29:18,980 --> 03:29:20,760
And we just play like the backside right here.

6433
03:29:21,060 --> 03:29:21,380
Wait.

6434
03:29:21,400 --> 03:29:21,980
They're trying to rotate.

6435
03:29:22,100 --> 03:29:22,460
They're swinging.

6436
03:29:22,600 --> 03:29:23,340
They're swinging far right.

6437
03:29:23,740 --> 03:29:24,060
Okay.

6438
03:29:24,340 --> 03:29:24,860
I think.

6439
03:29:25,100 --> 03:29:25,460
Are they ready?

6440
03:29:25,480 --> 03:29:26,020
I think I just saw something.

6441
03:29:26,560 --> 03:29:26,880
Whoa.

6442
03:29:27,140 --> 03:29:27,460
Chill.

6443
03:29:29,740 --> 03:29:30,060
Chill.

6444
03:29:30,060 --> 03:29:30,380
Oh.

6445
03:29:30,380 --> 03:29:31,180
Please don't get a curber.

6446
03:29:31,180 --> 03:29:32,580
They got the care package right there.

6447
03:29:32,680 --> 03:29:33,060
Are you serious?

6448
03:29:33,120 --> 03:29:33,840
Oh, it's a curber.

6449
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:34,300
They got a curber.

6450
03:29:34,300 --> 03:29:34,320
They got a curber.

6451
03:29:35,480 --> 03:29:36,120
Jesus Christ.

6452
03:29:36,280 --> 03:29:36,600
No.

6453
03:29:36,860 --> 03:29:37,180
All right.

6454
03:29:38,280 --> 03:29:39,500
We just can't peek them.

6455
03:29:39,540 --> 03:29:40,180
Just don't peek them at all.

6456
03:29:40,260 --> 03:29:41,820
They're gonna launch all one of us.

6457
03:29:42,400 --> 03:29:46,400
I'm gonna grab this 6x scope and snipe a little.

6458
03:29:47,680 --> 03:29:50,540
If we end up having to fight, just fight through the right over here if you have to.

6459
03:29:50,540 --> 03:29:50,660
Okay?

6460
03:29:51,020 --> 03:29:51,500
All right.

6461
03:29:51,540 --> 03:29:51,660
All right.

6462
03:29:52,240 --> 03:29:56,300
And then worst case scenario, we slide back and we play in bunker with a gen behind the back pillar.

6463
03:29:57,020 --> 03:29:57,500
Got you.

6464
03:29:57,500 --> 03:29:57,940
Car here.

6465
03:29:58,920 --> 03:30:00,020
This team rotated.

6466
03:30:00,260 --> 03:30:00,380
Oh.

6467
03:30:01,180 --> 03:30:02,620
Team north 22.

6468
03:30:03,440 --> 03:30:03,900
That's good.

6469
03:30:04,280 --> 03:30:06,080
Are you close to purple or no?

6470
03:30:06,220 --> 03:30:06,480
They're rotating.

6471
03:30:06,480 --> 03:30:06,800
For lifeline?

6472
03:30:06,920 --> 03:30:07,220
Probably not.

6473
03:30:07,300 --> 03:30:07,660
I am not.

6474
03:30:07,680 --> 03:30:08,020
I'm not.

6475
03:30:08,360 --> 03:30:08,920
There's a guy.

6476
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:09,760
His teammate's over there.

6477
03:30:11,940 --> 03:30:13,480
I don't want to just burn my ammo.

6478
03:30:13,520 --> 03:30:14,220
I have 167.

6479
03:30:14,440 --> 03:30:14,920
I don't know.

6480
03:30:14,920 --> 03:30:15,060
Yeah.

6481
03:30:15,060 --> 03:30:15,300
You're good.

6482
03:30:15,340 --> 03:30:15,560
You're good.

6483
03:30:15,600 --> 03:30:16,100
You just hold it.

6484
03:30:16,140 --> 03:30:16,520
That's a...

6485
03:30:17,580 --> 03:30:17,900
No.

6486
03:30:17,940 --> 03:30:18,200
Wait.

6487
03:30:18,200 --> 03:30:18,660
Aren't you leaving?

6488
03:30:19,380 --> 03:30:20,020
I'm scarred.

6489
03:30:20,020 --> 03:30:21,360
That means that's another team over here that's rotating.

6490
03:30:22,900 --> 03:30:23,220
Yep.

6491
03:30:26,020 --> 03:30:26,340
Aw.

6492
03:30:26,400 --> 03:30:26,760
I can't get it.

6493
03:30:26,760 --> 03:30:27,060
I'm gonna get it.

6494
03:30:28,140 --> 03:30:28,460
Careful.

6495
03:30:28,520 --> 03:30:29,420
Charge sentinel behind you.

6496
03:30:29,660 --> 03:30:30,080
All right.

6497
03:30:32,800 --> 03:30:33,100
I'm going to charge my sentinel and run up and try to knock one.

6498
03:30:33,100 --> 03:30:33,440
This is bad.

6499
03:30:33,640 --> 03:30:34,140
I'm not fucking.

6500
03:30:34,140 --> 03:30:34,840
Are they fighting out there?

6501
03:30:35,360 --> 03:30:35,940
Some of me.

6502
03:30:36,040 --> 03:30:36,280
Yep.

6503
03:30:36,880 --> 03:30:37,360
Cracked one.

6504
03:30:39,560 --> 03:30:40,100
Over here.

6505
03:30:40,200 --> 03:30:41,100
There's a catalyst here.

6506
03:30:41,740 --> 03:30:42,240
These guys are pretty good.

6507
03:30:42,240 --> 03:30:45,840
If they fight, I'm going to charge my sentinel and run up and try to knock one with iron sight.

6508
03:30:48,880 --> 03:30:50,220
Is anybody looking at our backs?

6509
03:30:50,460 --> 03:30:51,240
I'm worried that...

6510
03:30:51,240 --> 03:30:51,420
Yeah.

6511
03:30:51,800 --> 03:30:52,100
That's...

6512
03:30:52,100 --> 03:30:52,400
Yeah.

6513
03:30:54,860 --> 03:30:55,680
You're looking back.

6514
03:30:55,820 --> 03:30:56,680
I'm going to look at our side then.

6515
03:30:56,980 --> 03:30:57,780
Oh, we got a creeper.

6516
03:30:57,800 --> 03:30:58,420
We got a creeper on us.

6517
03:30:58,460 --> 03:30:58,860
I can grab that.

6518
03:30:58,860 --> 03:30:59,140
I can grab that.

6519
03:31:04,880 --> 03:31:06,240
I'm going to drop my sentinel.

6520
03:31:06,320 --> 03:31:07,880
I can refresh the wasp now.

6521
03:31:08,060 --> 03:31:09,040
Do you want me to refresh it or no?

6522
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:10,400
Oh, yeah.

6523
03:31:11,200 --> 03:31:12,780
Can you get ready to look over me?

6524
03:31:12,840 --> 03:31:13,900
I might die going through this grab package.

6525
03:31:14,160 --> 03:31:14,180
Okay.

6526
03:31:14,180 --> 03:31:14,380
Yeah.

6527
03:31:15,220 --> 03:31:16,220
I'm going to watch back still.

6528
03:31:16,380 --> 03:31:16,500
I'm going to still watch back.

6529
03:31:16,500 --> 03:31:18,260
Can you shoot the building to him?

6530
03:31:18,660 --> 03:31:20,280
We'll borrow your scope then.

6531
03:31:20,500 --> 03:31:21,920
Do I go with the car?

6532
03:31:22,600 --> 03:31:23,140
Okay, bro.

6533
03:31:25,140 --> 03:31:25,740
I'm looking.

6534
03:31:27,960 --> 03:31:29,060
He came over here to my right.

6535
03:31:29,100 --> 03:31:29,120
I'm going to go with the car.

6536
03:31:31,580 --> 03:31:31,860
I'm going to go with the car.

6537
03:31:31,860 --> 03:31:32,740
They're fighting on our ass, guys.

6538
03:31:32,740 --> 03:31:32,980
Oh, fuck.

6539
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:33,300
Okay.

6540
03:31:33,380 --> 03:31:33,780
I have to heal.

6541
03:31:34,060 --> 03:31:34,760
I have to heal now.

6542
03:31:35,100 --> 03:31:35,580
I can't.

6543
03:31:35,640 --> 03:31:37,300
They're kind of not on our ass, but like behind us.

6544
03:31:37,320 --> 03:31:37,520
Sorry.

6545
03:31:38,880 --> 03:31:40,100
But they are in this choke behind.

6546
03:31:40,340 --> 03:31:40,800
I'm dropping your scope.

6547
03:31:41,080 --> 03:31:41,800
We have like God spot.

6548
03:31:41,940 --> 03:31:42,500
We have God spot.

6549
03:31:42,640 --> 03:31:43,080
We just need to...

6550
03:31:43,080 --> 03:31:44,040
We need to just...

6551
03:31:44,040 --> 03:31:45,760
On this zone, we need to just kill the team behind us.

6552
03:31:45,820 --> 03:31:46,180
On your ping.

6553
03:31:46,360 --> 03:31:47,300
Did you grab your...

6554
03:31:47,960 --> 03:31:48,240
Wait.

6555
03:31:48,300 --> 03:31:48,960
Can I take your sentinel stuff?

6556
03:31:48,960 --> 03:31:49,080
You can take the sentinel.

6557
03:31:49,120 --> 03:31:49,560
I have creeper.

6558
03:31:49,560 --> 03:31:49,940
I have creeper.

6559
03:31:51,800 --> 03:31:52,900
I'm throwing my third care pack.

6560
03:31:53,080 --> 03:31:53,780
I'm throwing my third care pack.

6561
03:31:56,220 --> 03:31:59,680
Yeah, play the pack LOS, and then we just need to kill this team on the run in.

6562
03:32:01,960 --> 03:32:03,520
I'm swapping back to my P20 then.

6563
03:32:04,260 --> 03:32:04,540
Yeah.

6564
03:32:09,590 --> 03:32:10,730
In case they run up.

6565
03:32:13,550 --> 03:32:14,630
I'm going to syringe.

6566
03:32:16,550 --> 03:32:17,250
140 on the one side.

6567
03:32:19,650 --> 03:32:20,690
Oh, I broke the gen.

6568
03:32:20,810 --> 03:32:21,170
Look at this.

6569
03:32:21,190 --> 03:32:22,390
If you have your sentinel, you might be able to knock one.

6570
03:32:22,550 --> 03:32:23,390
I don't have my sentinel.

6571
03:32:23,390 --> 03:32:24,750
I can't.

6572
03:32:24,830 --> 03:32:25,090
Fuck.

6573
03:32:25,210 --> 03:32:25,890
I need to heal.

6574
03:32:26,030 --> 03:32:26,250
I think we finished.

6575
03:32:26,270 --> 03:32:26,370
Yeah.

6576
03:32:26,390 --> 03:32:26,890
That's okay.

6577
03:32:26,930 --> 03:32:27,230
That's okay.

6578
03:32:28,390 --> 03:32:29,770
We literally just have to...

6579
03:32:30,330 --> 03:32:31,390
They're trying to move up.

6580
03:32:31,470 --> 03:32:31,650
I have to...

6581
03:32:32,430 --> 03:32:32,970
That's a bad...

6582
03:32:32,970 --> 03:32:33,430
So she died.

6583
03:32:34,250 --> 03:32:34,770
I'm going to...

6584
03:32:36,370 --> 03:32:36,990
I'm going to find 140.

6585
03:32:38,050 --> 03:32:38,370
Okay.

6586
03:32:40,910 --> 03:32:43,490
I thought they were going to push up closer, so I got my P20.

6587
03:32:43,750 --> 03:32:43,790
That's okay.

6588
03:32:45,370 --> 03:32:47,490
I'm going to bring the sentinel closer to me then.

6589
03:32:47,570 --> 03:32:47,910
Be careful.

6590
03:32:47,930 --> 03:32:50,530
This left team might walk up on us while we're doing this.

6591
03:32:50,570 --> 03:32:50,730
Okay.

6592
03:32:50,730 --> 03:32:51,330
I'm just going to...

6593
03:32:51,330 --> 03:32:54,190
We just have to play more towards the right, and then we just have to hard farm them.

6594
03:32:56,250 --> 03:32:58,610
I'm just rotating my sentinel back and forth.

6595
03:33:01,630 --> 03:33:02,810
I'm going to play roof and try to carve one.

6596
03:33:02,990 --> 03:33:03,750
It's left flank caustic.

6597
03:33:05,290 --> 03:33:06,390
Where is the team to the left?

6598
03:33:06,550 --> 03:33:07,970
I think they're in the lower...

6599
03:33:07,970 --> 03:33:09,070
I hear them sliding here.

6600
03:33:09,430 --> 03:33:10,370
Yeah, they're below us.

6601
03:33:10,370 --> 03:33:10,670
Below us.

6602
03:33:10,670 --> 03:33:10,850
Right here.

6603
03:33:10,850 --> 03:33:11,130
Yeah, close.

6604
03:33:13,390 --> 03:33:14,190
I'm going to go for a carver shot.

6605
03:33:14,350 --> 03:33:14,730
I see them.

6606
03:33:14,770 --> 03:33:15,050
I see them.

6607
03:33:15,790 --> 03:33:16,190
Right here.

6608
03:33:17,390 --> 03:33:19,310
We can't fight them until we know there's nobody on our right.

6609
03:33:19,590 --> 03:33:20,490
They're going to try to fight us though.

6610
03:33:20,830 --> 03:33:21,350
They are, yeah.

6611
03:33:22,150 --> 03:33:23,070
They have hound caustic.

6612
03:33:23,170 --> 03:33:23,570
They're nading.

6613
03:33:23,630 --> 03:33:23,950
They're nading.

6614
03:33:24,030 --> 03:33:24,150
They're nading.

6615
03:33:24,150 --> 03:33:24,750
That might be them.

6616
03:33:28,960 --> 03:33:29,380
I'm looking.

6617
03:33:30,520 --> 03:33:31,260
We're pulling to kill them.

6618
03:33:31,320 --> 03:33:31,920
We have to fight to kill them.

6619
03:33:32,020 --> 03:33:32,400
I stun two.

6620
03:33:32,800 --> 03:33:33,100
All right.

6621
03:33:35,020 --> 03:33:35,840
Caustic at 190, 190.

6622
03:33:36,000 --> 03:33:36,520
Get ready to walk up.

6623
03:33:36,560 --> 03:33:36,800
I'm going to watch them.

6624
03:33:36,800 --> 03:33:37,580
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking.

6625
03:33:37,920 --> 03:33:38,480
I have my P20.

6626
03:33:39,800 --> 03:33:40,320
They're backing up.

6627
03:33:40,380 --> 03:33:40,700
They have wing on.

6628
03:33:41,400 --> 03:33:41,800
I have to back.

6629
03:33:42,400 --> 03:33:43,180
I stun one on the right.

6630
03:33:43,660 --> 03:33:44,280
You can play slow.

6631
03:33:44,400 --> 03:33:45,180
We can play a little slow still.

6632
03:33:45,300 --> 03:33:46,040
I'm going to play for a carver shot.

6633
03:33:46,620 --> 03:33:47,340
Careful, careful, Hemi.

6634
03:33:47,400 --> 03:33:48,280
You're really...

6635
03:33:49,720 --> 03:33:50,080
I'm fucked.

6636
03:33:50,380 --> 03:33:51,700
I'm covering, I'm covering, I'm covering for you.

6637
03:33:51,900 --> 03:33:52,360
Thank you, thank you.

6638
03:33:59,590 --> 03:34:00,230
All right, I can't hit you.

6639
03:34:00,230 --> 03:34:01,050
I'm going to try to cover you.

6640
03:34:01,350 --> 03:34:01,690
I'm going to try to cover you.

6641
03:34:01,690 --> 03:34:01,870
Popping a bat.

6642
03:34:03,490 --> 03:34:03,970
Fencing this.

6643
03:34:06,150 --> 03:34:06,570
I'm going to zone.

6644
03:34:06,830 --> 03:34:07,110
All right.

6645
03:34:07,130 --> 03:34:08,510
Yeah, we need to kill them for our reset.

6646
03:34:10,410 --> 03:34:11,870
I'm going to play left here and try to hit a carver shot.

6647
03:34:11,870 --> 03:34:12,330
I have one more nade.

6648
03:34:12,330 --> 03:34:13,510
I have one more nade that I can use.

6649
03:34:13,970 --> 03:34:14,210
Okay.

6650
03:34:14,250 --> 03:34:14,990
Try to sky nade them.

6651
03:34:15,090 --> 03:34:16,250
I'm going to swing left here and try to carver one.

6652
03:34:16,330 --> 03:34:16,430
Okay.

6653
03:34:16,430 --> 03:34:16,970
I'm waiting for a scan.

6654
03:34:17,070 --> 03:34:17,470
I'm waiting for a scan.

6655
03:34:19,030 --> 03:34:19,810
They're going to push.

6656
03:34:19,890 --> 03:34:20,170
They're going to push.

6657
03:34:20,410 --> 03:34:20,970
Okay, I'm ulting.

6658
03:34:21,050 --> 03:34:21,290
I'm ulting.

6659
03:34:21,510 --> 03:34:22,070
I'm hard walking up.

6660
03:34:22,090 --> 03:34:22,410
Hard walking up.

6661
03:34:22,490 --> 03:34:22,890
I'm waiting for a...

6662
03:34:24,990 --> 03:34:25,230
I'm 140.

6663
03:34:26,090 --> 03:34:26,330
No.

6664
03:34:27,450 --> 03:34:27,990
That's a good.

6665
03:34:28,070 --> 03:34:28,250
Got one.

6666
03:34:29,170 --> 03:34:29,890
I'm climbing on me.

6667
03:34:30,170 --> 03:34:30,630
Climbing, climbing.

6668
03:34:30,810 --> 03:34:31,030
On me.

6669
03:34:31,650 --> 03:34:32,010
Where?

6670
03:34:32,110 --> 03:34:32,650
On me, on me, on me.

6671
03:34:33,110 --> 03:34:33,670
I'm just out.

6672
03:34:33,710 --> 03:34:34,010
Just out right here.

6673
03:34:34,210 --> 03:34:34,570
No.

6674
03:34:35,450 --> 03:34:35,970
That's bad.

6675
03:34:36,130 --> 03:34:36,410
Yeah.

6676
03:34:37,530 --> 03:34:38,130
Good try.

6677
03:34:38,750 --> 03:34:39,990
That wingman is so...

6678
03:34:39,990 --> 03:34:41,730
Yeah, he had the wingman.

6679
03:34:43,470 --> 03:34:43,830
Yeah.

6680
03:34:43,890 --> 03:34:46,970
That wingman helped.

6681
03:34:47,030 --> 03:34:47,390
It's okay.

6682
03:34:47,390 --> 03:34:48,390
We thirsted their second.

6683
03:34:48,390 --> 03:34:49,010
We thirsted.

6684
03:34:49,370 --> 03:34:49,630
GG.

6685
03:34:49,870 --> 03:34:50,590
We made finals.

6686
03:34:50,590 --> 03:34:50,670
It's okay.

6687
03:34:50,710 --> 03:34:51,630
We made finals.

6688
03:34:51,970 --> 03:34:53,130
That's all that matters.

6689
03:34:53,690 --> 03:34:54,990
What's our count for this one?

6690
03:34:55,330 --> 03:34:56,310
I don't even think it matters.

6691
03:34:56,330 --> 03:34:57,330
Not enough.

6692
03:34:57,450 --> 03:34:57,590
Yeah.

6693
03:34:57,650 --> 03:34:58,210
I don't think it matters.

6694
03:34:58,550 --> 03:34:59,990
We counted for the overall.

6695
03:35:01,150 --> 03:35:01,850
You want to count?

6696
03:35:02,050 --> 03:35:02,210
Yeah.

6697
03:35:02,210 --> 03:35:03,770
We should count it for the overall.

6698
03:35:04,010 --> 03:35:04,290
Yeah.

6699
03:35:04,290 --> 03:35:04,370
Yeah.

6700
03:35:04,690 --> 03:35:05,010
Overall.

6701
03:35:06,270 --> 03:35:06,830
It's fine.

6702
03:35:07,070 --> 03:35:07,710
We got the...

6703
03:35:07,710 --> 03:35:08,150
Actually, it sucks.

6704
03:35:08,250 --> 03:35:11,610
I had shot this guy, but he had purple helmet, so he didn't die.

6705
03:35:11,910 --> 03:35:13,330
We did the knock with the thermal.

6706
03:35:13,690 --> 03:35:15,210
We didn't do any PVs though.

6707
03:35:15,230 --> 03:35:15,510
No.

6708
03:35:15,530 --> 03:35:15,670
No.

6709
03:35:15,670 --> 03:35:15,930
We did not.

6710
03:35:15,990 --> 03:35:16,810
We were just playing for the...

6711
03:35:16,810 --> 03:35:17,590
We did the gravity cannon.

6712
03:35:21,890 --> 03:35:22,670
We did the heart.

6713
03:35:22,830 --> 03:35:23,690
One, two, three, four.

6714
03:35:23,690 --> 03:35:23,770
Yeah.

6715
03:35:23,790 --> 03:35:24,170
The heart.

6716
03:35:27,230 --> 03:35:27,710
That's it.

6717
03:35:28,510 --> 03:35:28,830
That's it.

6718
03:35:29,410 --> 03:35:30,290
That's actually it.

6719
03:35:30,350 --> 03:35:31,610
Oh, and my ult four times.

6720
03:35:31,650 --> 03:35:32,030
Five.

6721
03:35:32,090 --> 03:35:33,090
No survival items.

6722
03:35:33,470 --> 03:35:33,810
Yeah.

6723
03:35:33,850 --> 03:35:34,270
I counted that.

6724
03:35:34,390 --> 03:35:34,510
Yeah.

6725
03:35:34,550 --> 03:35:34,910
I counted that.

6726
03:35:35,010 --> 03:35:35,250
Wait.

6727
03:35:35,350 --> 03:35:35,550
What?

6728
03:35:35,550 --> 03:35:36,450
What did you count before?

6729
03:35:36,690 --> 03:35:44,830
It was knock with the thermite, don't use survival, gravity cannon, Watson heart, and use the ult three times.

6730
03:35:45,430 --> 03:35:46,230
That's four?

6731
03:35:46,630 --> 03:35:47,030
Five?

6732
03:35:47,050 --> 03:35:47,710
And that is all.

6733
03:35:47,750 --> 03:35:48,070
That's five.

6734
03:35:48,110 --> 03:35:48,410
That's five.

6735
03:35:48,470 --> 03:35:48,750
Five?

6736
03:35:48,830 --> 03:35:49,890
You know, five is great.

6737
03:35:50,650 --> 03:35:51,330
Good effort.

6738
03:35:51,490 --> 03:35:51,730
Wait.

6739
03:35:51,810 --> 03:35:54,870
Did you get the P20 knock or sentinel knock?

6740
03:35:55,090 --> 03:35:55,490
No.

6741
03:35:55,490 --> 03:35:56,950
I got it with the prowler.

6742
03:35:57,610 --> 03:35:57,930
Yeah.

6743
03:35:57,990 --> 03:35:58,910
I didn't get it.

6744
03:35:59,690 --> 03:36:01,010
I got it with the prowler.

6745
03:36:01,650 --> 03:36:01,970
Yay.

6746
03:36:02,050 --> 03:36:02,950
We made it to finals.

6747
03:36:03,710 --> 03:36:04,030
Yay.

6748
03:36:04,110 --> 03:36:04,390
We did.

6749
03:36:05,050 --> 03:36:05,670
Good job.

6750
03:36:06,490 --> 03:36:07,210
All right, y'all.

6751
03:36:08,390 --> 03:36:08,970
That's it, right?

6752
03:36:09,090 --> 03:36:09,590
That's the last game?

6753
03:36:09,670 --> 03:36:09,750
Yeah.

6754
03:36:09,750 --> 03:36:10,350
That was the last game.

6755
03:36:10,590 --> 03:36:10,610
Yeah.

6756
03:36:10,870 --> 03:36:11,550
Oh my God.

6757
03:36:11,610 --> 03:36:14,790
This has been almost like four hours.

6758
03:36:14,830 --> 03:36:15,410
This was long.

6759
03:36:15,490 --> 03:36:15,990
This was long.

6760
03:36:16,050 --> 03:36:17,170
For six hands, it was long.

6761
03:36:17,550 --> 03:36:18,210
To be fair.

6762
03:36:18,230 --> 03:36:20,750
I mean, imagine if we could have walked up on this nonsense.

6763
03:36:20,990 --> 03:36:21,810
This would have been free.

6764
03:36:22,070 --> 03:36:22,730
I don't know.

6765
03:36:22,790 --> 03:36:23,850
They're dying right now.

6766
03:36:24,550 --> 03:36:26,390
I know, but we would have been able to walk up.

6767
03:36:26,390 --> 03:36:28,210
So, would have had Wingman, Kraber.

6768
03:36:28,330 --> 03:36:29,130
They're actually deleted.

6769
03:36:29,350 --> 03:36:30,470
We would have had triple care package.

6770
03:36:30,830 --> 03:36:31,370
That's true.

6771
03:36:31,490 --> 03:36:32,150
That's true.

6772
03:36:32,550 --> 03:36:33,530
Oh, wait.

6773
03:36:33,590 --> 03:36:34,450
They get free raise.

6774
03:36:34,870 --> 03:36:35,090
No.

6775
03:36:35,250 --> 03:36:36,270
Someone push him.

6776
03:36:36,410 --> 03:36:37,430
Oh, that Kraber hit.

6777
03:36:38,010 --> 03:36:38,450
Yes.

6778
03:36:39,490 --> 03:36:40,090
Come on.

6779
03:36:40,130 --> 03:36:41,090
He's literally one hit.

6780
03:36:43,390 --> 03:36:44,270
It's so close.

6781
03:36:44,650 --> 03:36:44,970
Wait.

6782
03:36:45,030 --> 03:36:45,490
Why am I looking?

6783
03:36:46,650 --> 03:36:47,810
Oh my God.

6784
03:36:47,810 --> 03:36:48,550
He's going to win it.

6785
03:36:48,850 --> 03:36:49,710
Oh my God.

6786
03:36:49,730 --> 03:36:50,190
He's going to win?

6787
03:36:51,170 --> 03:36:51,910
That's insane.

6788
03:36:52,410 --> 03:36:53,270
That was crazy.

6789
03:36:54,530 --> 03:36:55,630
That was crazy.

6790
03:36:55,790 --> 03:36:56,370
That was crazy.

6791
03:36:56,390 --> 03:36:57,570
That was insane game from them.

6792
03:36:58,670 --> 03:36:59,990
Wait, can we see the standings?

6793
03:37:00,110 --> 03:37:01,210
There's no standings.

6794
03:37:01,230 --> 03:37:03,210
It's like a game each.

6795
03:37:03,570 --> 03:37:05,070
Each game is its own thing.

6796
03:37:05,470 --> 03:37:05,910
Yeah.

6797
03:37:05,970 --> 03:37:07,650
There isn't any overall standings.

6798
03:37:07,750 --> 03:37:08,590
There's going to be...

6799
03:37:08,590 --> 03:37:10,890
The only overall thing will be two most kills overall.

6800
03:37:11,210 --> 03:37:11,490
Yeah.

6801
03:37:11,610 --> 03:37:13,610
I don't think that's any of them.

6802
03:37:17,350 --> 03:37:18,630
That's on the controller, please.

6803
03:37:18,650 --> 03:37:19,630
It's legit impossible.

6804
03:37:20,050 --> 03:37:20,450
I mean, okay.

6805
03:37:20,550 --> 03:37:21,350
This is rigged.

6806
03:37:21,390 --> 03:37:23,370
Each team should have one controller playing.

6807
03:37:24,630 --> 03:37:25,370
Oh, no.

6808
03:37:25,910 --> 03:37:26,350
Oh, no.

6809
03:37:26,390 --> 03:37:27,350
That was fun.

6810
03:37:27,490 --> 03:37:28,170
That was fun.

6811
03:37:28,910 --> 03:37:29,270
GG's.

6812
03:37:29,510 --> 03:37:30,510
We made it to the finals.

6813
03:37:31,670 --> 03:37:32,750
That's all that matters.

6814
03:37:33,350 --> 03:37:33,830
I know.

6815
03:37:33,890 --> 03:37:34,490
I'm so proud of us.

6816
03:37:34,950 --> 03:37:35,570
Oh my God.

6817
03:37:35,570 --> 03:37:37,890
We almost got like a champion and finals.

6818
03:37:38,050 --> 03:37:38,950
That would've been sick.

6819
03:37:40,770 --> 03:37:42,970
That would've been so fucking sick.

6820
03:37:43,010 --> 03:37:45,070
So we're not allowed to play the other ones, right?

6821
03:37:45,270 --> 03:37:45,630
No.

6822
03:37:45,770 --> 03:37:46,730
I think we are.

6823
03:37:48,030 --> 03:37:49,090
I think we get invited.

6824
03:37:49,370 --> 03:37:49,990
I don't know why not.

6825
03:37:50,090 --> 03:37:50,450
Yeah.

6826
03:37:51,090 --> 03:37:53,330
They might not just invite because we already made finals.

6827
03:37:54,210 --> 03:37:54,730
That's true.

6828
03:37:54,850 --> 03:37:56,210
They want to give everyone a chance at finals.

6829
03:37:56,230 --> 03:37:56,370
I think we are.

6830
03:37:56,390 --> 03:37:56,810
I guess so.

6831
03:37:57,050 --> 03:37:57,290
Yeah.

6832
03:37:57,690 --> 03:37:58,890
We gotta play on an alt or something.

6833
03:37:59,230 --> 03:37:59,890
But is that fair?

6834
03:38:00,030 --> 03:38:02,210
The other tournaments sound so fun.

6835
03:38:03,070 --> 03:38:05,270
There's the one that was the... what's it?

6836
03:38:05,350 --> 03:38:06,570
The Watson Punch-Up.

6837
03:38:07,410 --> 03:38:09,190
And then the Trio No Weapons.

6838
03:38:09,370 --> 03:38:10,610
That sounds so fucking fun.

6839
03:38:11,630 --> 03:38:12,270
I agree.

6840
03:38:12,790 --> 03:38:13,190
Yeah.

6841
03:38:13,810 --> 03:38:14,210
Yeah.

6842
03:38:14,250 --> 03:38:15,170
We actually got the hard one.

6843
03:38:15,550 --> 03:38:15,950
Yeah.

6844
03:38:15,950 --> 03:38:16,730
We got the hard one.

6845
03:38:17,070 --> 03:38:18,630
You actually have to like try it.

6846
03:38:18,790 --> 03:38:20,630
I thought the first one was the easiest.

6847
03:38:20,790 --> 03:38:22,110
That's why I signed up for it.

6848
03:38:22,410 --> 03:38:26,310
We're going to be watching the next week and they're just going to be playing hide and seek, like hiding in bushes and stuff.

6849
03:38:27,570 --> 03:38:28,690
I'm so sad.

6850
03:38:28,870 --> 03:38:34,410
I was like, oh man, this first one with the mini games, that one has to be the hide and seek one.

6851
03:38:35,210 --> 03:38:36,130
I was wrong.

6852
03:38:36,470 --> 03:38:37,770
I was so wrong.

6853
03:38:39,870 --> 03:38:41,210
We did great though.

6854
03:38:42,230 --> 03:38:42,950
Proud of us.

6855
03:38:43,030 --> 03:38:43,270
We did great.

6856
03:38:43,510 --> 03:38:43,910
Yeah.

6857
03:38:43,910 --> 03:38:44,430
GG's guys.

6858
03:38:44,710 --> 03:38:45,510
GG's everybody.

6859
03:38:45,990 --> 03:38:47,710
It was great meeting all of you guys.

6860
03:38:48,090 --> 03:38:48,570
Yeah.

6861
03:38:48,570 --> 03:38:48,830
You too.

6862
03:38:48,950 --> 03:38:49,110
You too.

6863
03:38:49,330 --> 03:38:49,630
Yeah.

6864
03:38:50,830 --> 03:38:51,310
GG's.

6865
03:38:51,310 --> 03:38:52,490
Bye bye guys.

6866
03:38:53,210 --> 03:38:53,650
Bye.

6867
03:38:53,730 --> 03:38:54,150
Bye.

6868
03:38:54,470 --> 03:38:54,950
Peace.

6869
03:38:55,890 --> 03:38:56,370
Peace.

6870
03:38:56,390 --> 03:38:57,190
Oh my God.

6871
03:38:57,510 --> 03:38:58,770
We did it guys.

6872
03:38:59,150 --> 03:39:00,610
We got to the finals.

6873
03:39:01,470 --> 03:39:02,970
Easy thousand dollars.

6874
03:39:04,670 --> 03:39:05,690
Winner of the finals.

6875
03:39:06,570 --> 03:39:09,770
The finals are March 28th.

6876
03:39:10,850 --> 03:39:12,850
So just look forward to that.

6877
03:39:12,970 --> 03:39:14,970
I don't know if I can actually participate in the other ones.

6878
03:39:15,050 --> 03:39:16,790
I wish I could participate in the other ones.

6879
03:39:16,850 --> 03:39:17,610
The other ones are so fun.

6880
03:39:18,150 --> 03:39:25,730
Like I really wanted to do the March 21st with the three strikes, no weapons and Watson punch out.

6881
03:39:25,870 --> 03:39:33,590
The Watson punch out is apparently like the players have to kill the Watson character on the other team via punching.

6882
03:39:33,850 --> 03:39:35,490
Like that sounds so fucking fun.

6883
03:39:36,390 --> 03:39:38,430
I'm just going to ask him.

6884
03:39:39,490 --> 03:39:40,050
Tempo.

6885
03:39:40,150 --> 03:39:42,970
Can I still do the other damage?

6886
03:39:43,870 --> 03:39:46,550
Even though I got into the finals.

6887
03:39:51,370 --> 03:39:52,510
I'm going to ask him.

6888
03:39:53,350 --> 03:39:54,970
Because the other ones.

6889
03:39:54,970 --> 03:39:56,950
Sounds so fun.

6890
03:40:02,450 --> 03:40:03,750
Let me in.

6891
03:40:04,250 --> 03:40:05,030
Let me in.

6892
03:40:14,350 --> 03:40:15,530
I got it.

6893
03:40:15,850 --> 03:40:17,110
Let her in.

6894
03:40:19,870 --> 03:40:20,850
All right.

6895
03:40:21,330 --> 03:40:22,110
Anyway.

6896
03:40:22,110 --> 03:40:23,970
They still have to apparently check the...

6897
03:40:23,970 --> 03:40:24,530
Um.

6898
03:40:24,550 --> 03:40:24,950
Let me in.

6899
03:40:24,950 --> 03:40:28,490
Check to make sure... Guys, do we have any cool clips?

6900
03:40:28,810 --> 03:40:30,670
Do we have any more cool clips?

6901
03:40:30,830 --> 03:40:32,410
Because they're going to be voting for clips, I think.

6902
03:40:34,630 --> 03:40:37,510
Guys, are there any more cool clips?

6903
03:40:37,870 --> 03:40:39,370
We can get like 3000!

6904
03:40:40,550 --> 03:40:41,730
Sorry, no.

6905
03:40:41,830 --> 03:40:42,410
We can 2000.

6906
03:40:42,970 --> 03:40:46,350
No, we can technically get 3000 if we won two of the clips.

6907
03:40:46,650 --> 03:40:48,590
If both of our clips are really, really good.

6908
03:40:51,930 --> 03:40:52,730
Okay, let's see.

6909
03:40:53,510 --> 03:40:54,370
Alright, no.

6910
03:40:54,470 --> 03:40:55,910
This is... No, not these clips.

6911
03:40:56,090 --> 03:40:56,350
Okay.

6912
03:40:57,050 --> 03:40:59,150
Why did you clip me making a heart?

6913
03:41:05,370 --> 03:41:08,350
Okay, no.

6914
03:41:08,450 --> 03:41:10,650
None of these... None of these clips are as good.

6915
03:41:10,850 --> 03:41:11,250
No.

6916
03:41:11,450 --> 03:41:13,730
Okay, we submitted three clips, guys.

6917
03:41:14,510 --> 03:41:16,550
When are they going to vote for the clips?

6918
03:41:18,390 --> 03:41:20,830
We just need to wait for them to start voting.

6919
03:41:22,730 --> 03:41:23,930
We just need to have the vote.

6920
03:41:24,150 --> 03:41:25,390
And then we're good to go.

6921
03:41:26,370 --> 03:41:27,470
We need the vote.

6922
03:41:27,650 --> 03:41:28,770
Let me in!

6923
03:41:29,130 --> 03:41:30,110
Let me in!

6924
03:41:33,410 --> 03:41:33,890
Okay.

6925
03:41:34,570 --> 03:41:38,550
So, apparently, what's left is the clip.

6926
03:41:38,630 --> 03:41:42,610
I don't know if I should wait until the clip...

6927
03:41:42,610 --> 03:41:45,590
the clip vote, or if I should...

6928
03:41:47,490 --> 03:41:50,570
If I should just call it.

6929
03:41:52,690 --> 03:41:55,070
I don't know how the clip stuff is going to work.

6930
03:41:55,210 --> 03:41:56,490
Like, are they doing the vote now?

6931
03:41:57,170 --> 03:41:57,650
Or...

6932
03:41:58,270 --> 03:42:00,830
Or the introvert clip is called?

6933
03:42:00,970 --> 03:42:01,210
Okay.

6934
03:42:01,410 --> 03:42:02,450
Alright, I'll post that.

6935
03:42:02,490 --> 03:42:02,630
No!

6936
03:42:02,790 --> 03:42:03,430
That's bad!

6937
03:42:04,370 --> 03:42:10,550
Because it's like... You see my pain of trying to fucking talk to people.

6938
03:42:14,430 --> 03:42:15,030
Okay, wait.

6939
03:42:15,110 --> 03:42:15,390
Let me in.

6940
03:42:18,140 --> 03:42:19,020
What the fuck?

6941
03:42:19,040 --> 03:42:20,880
That's just me spilling my bubble tea!

6942
03:42:20,880 --> 03:42:22,200
That's fucked up!

6943
03:42:28,240 --> 03:42:29,560
What the fuck do you mean?

6944
03:42:29,800 --> 03:42:30,660
It's relatable.

6945
03:42:31,100 --> 03:42:31,760
Okay, fine.

6946
03:42:31,820 --> 03:42:32,340
I'll post this.

6947
03:42:32,720 --> 03:42:35,020
Look, everybody else's clips... Guys!

6948
03:42:35,300 --> 03:42:36,780
I'll just have you know...

6949
03:42:36,780 --> 03:42:39,760
Everybody else's clips are like...

6950
03:42:39,760 --> 03:42:40,440
Gameplay.

6951
03:42:45,700 --> 03:42:48,220
Everyone else's clips are like...

6952
03:42:48,220 --> 03:42:49,620
Gameplay clips.

6953
03:42:49,900 --> 03:42:52,540
And then I'm just the one being like...

6954
03:42:52,540 --> 03:42:54,540
Look at all the shit I fucked up on.

6955
03:42:54,720 --> 03:42:55,580
Look at all the shit I fucked up on.

6956
03:42:55,600 --> 03:42:56,140
Holy shit!

6957
03:42:57,420 --> 03:42:59,780
I set you apart.

6958
03:43:00,220 --> 03:43:00,860
Like...

6959
03:43:00,860 --> 03:43:02,320
What is this bullshit?

6960
03:43:02,320 --> 03:43:03,000
Guys!

6961
03:43:03,500 --> 03:43:04,080
Please!

6962
03:43:05,220 --> 03:43:06,860
Guys, this is not fair.

6963
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:07,920
All my clips are...

6964
03:43:07,920 --> 03:43:08,760
Like...

6965
03:43:08,760 --> 03:43:10,200
Everybody else's... It's like... Look!

6966
03:43:10,440 --> 03:43:11,320
1v4!

6967
03:43:12,220 --> 03:43:13,600
Wingman clutch!

6968
03:43:14,060 --> 03:43:16,000
Triple sentinel knock!

6969
03:43:16,680 --> 03:43:19,600
1A 285 damage!

6970
03:43:22,160 --> 03:43:24,000
And then you guys!

6971
03:43:25,640 --> 03:43:27,100
Goodbye, you're dead.

6972
03:43:29,180 --> 03:43:30,940
Team discussing the strats.

6973
03:43:31,160 --> 03:43:31,680
Jokey.

6974
03:43:34,740 --> 03:43:36,880
Send Knox unalives himself.

6975
03:43:37,720 --> 03:43:39,400
Guys, what the fuck is this?

6976
03:43:39,580 --> 03:43:40,400
I didn't like this one.

6977
03:43:40,480 --> 03:43:41,500
Epic win!

6978
03:43:42,980 --> 03:43:43,500
Playmaker!

6979
03:43:46,800 --> 03:43:48,360
Final two teams!

6980
03:43:49,060 --> 03:43:49,880
What do you mean?

6981
03:43:50,140 --> 03:43:50,900
What is this bullshit?

6982
03:43:51,060 --> 03:43:52,760
Give me something that makes me look good.

6983
03:43:54,240 --> 03:43:54,760
Yeah.

6984
03:43:55,600 --> 03:43:57,700
I got the flavor cleveless.

6985
03:43:57,780 --> 03:43:58,660
You're like...

6986
03:44:01,480 --> 03:44:04,480
You are the content creator for a reason.

6987
03:44:04,760 --> 03:44:06,000
This is not fair!

6988
03:44:07,620 --> 03:44:08,160
Why?

6989
03:44:08,760 --> 03:44:09,780
I like...

6990
03:44:09,780 --> 03:44:10,740
Oh my god!

6991
03:44:10,940 --> 03:44:12,460
This one has subtitles!

6992
03:44:12,700 --> 03:44:12,880
Wait!

6993
03:44:15,880 --> 03:44:16,880
Oh my god.

6994
03:44:18,320 --> 03:44:19,720
This is so bullshit.

6995
03:44:19,840 --> 03:44:21,540
This is actually so bullshit, guys.

6996
03:44:23,660 --> 03:44:25,120
This is so bullshit.

6997
03:44:25,600 --> 03:44:26,760
Why don't I get the cool clips?

6998
03:44:30,620 --> 03:44:32,320
We don't need to look good.

6999
03:44:32,460 --> 03:44:33,700
We are good.

7000
03:44:37,980 --> 03:44:39,300
This is bullshit!

7001
03:44:39,760 --> 03:44:41,280
I should have good clips!

7002
03:44:42,180 --> 03:44:43,300
I did so...

7003
03:44:43,300 --> 03:44:45,900
I was so fucking cool in some of them.

7004
03:44:46,180 --> 03:44:46,820
Come on.

7005
03:44:46,860 --> 03:44:48,180
We're helping you send out.

7006
03:44:48,260 --> 03:44:48,920
That is true.

7007
03:44:49,420 --> 03:44:50,160
That is true.

7008
03:44:50,260 --> 03:44:53,340
But the people that are voting for this are all fucking apex watchers.

7009
03:44:53,340 --> 03:44:55,040
They don't give a fuck about content.

7010
03:44:55,260 --> 03:44:56,120
They don't...

7011
03:44:59,110 --> 03:45:00,660
What the fuck do you mean?

7012
03:45:01,840 --> 03:45:03,640
These are apex watchers!

7013
03:45:03,660 --> 03:45:06,160
They don't care about what's funny.

7014
03:45:06,220 --> 03:45:07,900
They care about what's cool.

7015
03:45:08,380 --> 03:45:09,260
They don't care about what's funny.

7016
03:45:09,320 --> 03:45:09,860
They care about what's cool.

7017
03:45:10,700 --> 03:45:11,240
Wait!

7018
03:45:11,440 --> 03:45:11,680
No!

7019
03:45:11,780 --> 03:45:12,000
Wait!

7020
03:45:12,060 --> 03:45:12,160
No!

7021
03:45:12,160 --> 03:45:13,000
This is so big brain.

7022
03:45:17,110 --> 03:45:20,460
Because all the apex watchers are going to be split vote.

7023
03:45:21,460 --> 03:45:23,320
Because all the apex watchers are going to be split vote.

7024
03:45:23,320 --> 03:45:24,060
They are all like so cool.

7025
03:45:24,920 --> 03:45:25,620
Wait, no!

7026
03:45:25,660 --> 03:45:26,300
You guys are actually.

7027
03:45:26,540 --> 03:45:27,960
You guys are actually really smart.

7028
03:45:28,300 --> 03:45:29,560
You guys are actually so smart.

7029
03:45:29,720 --> 03:45:30,660
You're splitting all the votes.

7030
03:45:30,860 --> 03:45:33,500
We're splitting all the votes of like all the...

7031
03:45:34,420 --> 03:45:36,180
All the fucking...

7032
03:45:36,680 --> 03:45:37,960
All the cool clips.

7033
03:45:38,300 --> 03:45:42,560
So then people who just want to laugh, they'll vote for me because they will laugh at me.

7034
03:45:42,620 --> 03:45:43,200
Not with me.

7035
03:45:43,680 --> 03:45:44,940
So, god.

7036
03:45:45,060 --> 03:45:46,020
I don't know if that's...

7037
03:45:46,020 --> 03:45:49,700
The thing is, I don't know if there is enough voters that will vote for that.

7038
03:45:49,900 --> 03:45:50,780
I don't know.

7039
03:45:55,600 --> 03:46:00,560
The only issue is that I don't know if we have enough voters that will vote for that though!

7040
03:46:03,280 --> 03:46:04,720
What if there's not enough?

7041
03:46:10,120 --> 03:46:11,760
Yeah, that's totally the plan.

7042
03:46:11,980 --> 03:46:13,380
Are they voting for the clips now?

7043
03:46:13,560 --> 03:46:15,020
Okay, let's see.

7044
03:46:16,320 --> 03:46:16,800
Alright.

7045
03:46:17,100 --> 03:46:18,200
Do we have anymore?

7046
03:46:18,380 --> 03:46:20,680
Okay, I'll send in one more funny clip.

7047
03:46:21,300 --> 03:46:24,380
I'll get the undecided voters.

7048
03:46:24,900 --> 03:46:26,800
That's where we're aiming at right now.

7049
03:46:26,880 --> 03:46:29,900
We are the undecided voters.

7050
03:46:33,100 --> 03:46:33,600
Okay.

7051
03:46:33,720 --> 03:46:36,860
I will send one more clip into the category.

7052
03:46:37,360 --> 03:46:38,500
There's so many clips.

7053
03:46:38,660 --> 03:46:40,160
I'm the only one that sent more than one.

7054
03:46:40,360 --> 03:46:42,720
I'm actually just spamming them.

7055
03:46:46,080 --> 03:46:49,220
I'm just spamming them shit right now.

7056
03:46:49,400 --> 03:46:50,660
We are in the excitement.

7057
03:46:50,680 --> 03:46:51,280
We are the exception here.

7058
03:46:51,440 --> 03:46:51,860
Alright.

7059
03:46:54,700 --> 03:46:55,720
Okay, what else?

7060
03:46:55,800 --> 03:46:57,040
What can we...

7061
03:46:58,180 --> 03:47:00,040
What can we send?

7062
03:47:04,700 --> 03:47:05,280
Okay.

7063
03:47:08,080 --> 03:47:08,960
Alright, let's see.

7064
03:47:09,020 --> 03:47:10,840
I'm trying to see.

7065
03:47:11,640 --> 03:47:12,540
I need to know.

7066
03:47:12,600 --> 03:47:13,580
Can we vote?

7067
03:47:13,720 --> 03:47:17,020
Okay, the voting is happening in the community's...

7068
03:47:17,020 --> 03:47:18,840
like, girls' Discord right now.

7069
03:47:19,480 --> 03:47:20,060
Uh...

7070
03:47:20,680 --> 03:47:21,640
So, like...

7071
03:47:22,820 --> 03:47:23,800
So, like...

7072
03:47:23,800 --> 03:47:26,480
We can't vote for it because we're not in her Discord.

7073
03:47:27,080 --> 03:47:28,200
Send the voting...

7074
03:47:28,200 --> 03:47:29,600
It's happening in her Discord!

7075
03:47:33,740 --> 03:47:36,300
We're not gonna raid her Discord just to vote.

7076
03:47:36,640 --> 03:47:37,440
What is this?

7077
03:47:37,660 --> 03:47:38,420
Wait, drop the clip.

7078
03:47:38,960 --> 03:47:39,860
Is it a cool clip?

7079
03:47:40,000 --> 03:47:41,960
Or is it a ha-ha funny clip?

7080
03:47:43,960 --> 03:47:44,440
Shit!

7081
03:47:45,100 --> 03:47:46,040
Guys, no!

7082
03:47:46,760 --> 03:47:48,810
I'm good!

7083
03:47:49,410 --> 03:47:51,050
How are we going to...

7084
03:47:51,050 --> 03:47:51,610
Guys!

7085
03:47:52,650 --> 03:47:54,130
How are we gonna beat this?

7086
03:47:54,730 --> 03:47:56,570
How are we gonna beat this?

7087
03:48:05,590 --> 03:48:07,410
He took the ha-ha vote!

7088
03:48:11,250 --> 03:48:12,970
How do we beat that?

7089
03:48:16,370 --> 03:48:16,890
Good!

7090
03:48:23,680 --> 03:48:24,440
It's over.

7091
03:48:25,180 --> 03:48:26,280
It's so over.

7092
03:48:26,340 --> 03:48:26,960
I linked it.

7093
03:48:27,900 --> 03:48:29,200
I fucking linked it.

7094
03:48:31,580 --> 03:48:32,100
This...

7095
03:48:32,100 --> 03:48:32,700
That one...

7096
03:48:32,700 --> 03:48:34,340
Yeah, that one was pretty funny!

7097
03:48:34,760 --> 03:48:35,260
No!

7098
03:48:40,560 --> 03:48:41,580
I did it.

7099
03:48:41,580 --> 03:48:42,420
I sent the link.

7100
03:48:42,560 --> 03:48:43,160
It's over.

7101
03:48:43,380 --> 03:48:44,100
It's so over.

7102
03:48:44,180 --> 03:48:44,980
We're not gonna win...

7103
03:48:44,980 --> 03:48:47,160
We're not gonna win the ha-ha clip now.

7104
03:48:48,320 --> 03:48:50,440
We're not gonna win the ha-ha clip.

7105
03:48:52,420 --> 03:48:53,200
It's over.

7106
03:48:53,320 --> 03:48:54,860
Even you guys know it's over.

7107
03:48:55,460 --> 03:48:56,860
You guys know it's over.

7108
03:48:56,860 --> 03:48:56,860
Yeah!

7109
03:48:57,020 --> 03:48:57,760
That was...

7110
03:48:59,340 --> 03:49:00,080
That's over!

7111
03:49:03,280 --> 03:49:05,420
Going down knowing that you tried.

7112
03:49:05,760 --> 03:49:07,020
Okay, I'm gonna...

7113
03:49:07,020 --> 03:49:08,000
Alright.

7114
03:49:11,840 --> 03:49:12,780
Okay, alright.

7115
03:49:12,880 --> 03:49:13,600
I will...

7116
03:49:13,600 --> 03:49:16,100
I will send one last clip, guys.

7117
03:49:16,240 --> 03:49:17,640
I will send one last clip.

7118
03:49:18,500 --> 03:49:20,000
I'll send one last clip.

7119
03:49:20,100 --> 03:49:21,360
Is there anything that we have?

7120
03:49:21,960 --> 03:49:22,720
That's good!

7121
03:49:23,240 --> 03:49:24,560
Do we have anything?

7122
03:49:24,920 --> 03:49:25,760
We tried.

7123
03:49:25,860 --> 03:49:26,280
It's over.

7124
03:49:26,400 --> 03:49:27,040
Okay, nevermind.

7125
03:49:27,160 --> 03:49:27,920
We all gave up.

7126
03:49:28,400 --> 03:49:28,880
Alright.

7127
03:49:29,260 --> 03:49:30,920
I'm not gonna wait until...

7128
03:49:30,920 --> 03:49:34,020
I'm not gonna see who got the clips that...

7129
03:49:34,020 --> 03:49:34,840
It's over.

7130
03:49:35,840 --> 03:49:37,840
Introvert clip is still fu- FINE!

7131
03:49:37,900 --> 03:49:40,880
I'll do the introvert- Wait, are you the one that fucking made that clip?

7132
03:49:40,960 --> 03:49:42,560
Is that why you keep shilling it?

7133
03:49:42,640 --> 03:49:43,100
No, you're not.

7134
03:49:43,160 --> 03:49:43,840
Okay, I'll...

7135
03:49:44,640 --> 03:49:45,120
Fine!

7136
03:49:46,260 --> 03:49:49,160
I'll send the introvert clip over.

7137
03:49:51,640 --> 03:49:52,120
I'll send the introvert clip over.

7138
03:49:52,220 --> 03:49:52,700
I'll send the introvert clip over.

7139
03:49:54,260 --> 03:49:55,820
Alright, I'm gonna call it here.

7140
03:49:55,880 --> 03:49:56,640
That was fun though!

7141
03:49:56,840 --> 03:49:58,300
Okay, for those who don't know...

7142
03:49:58,300 --> 03:50:00,040
Change of schedule.

7143
03:50:00,080 --> 03:50:01,180
I'll post this on Twitter.

7144
03:50:01,780 --> 03:50:02,340
And...

7145
03:50:03,460 --> 03:50:05,020
I'll post this on Twitter later.

7146
03:50:05,380 --> 03:50:08,240
But there has been a change of schedule!

7147
03:50:09,160 --> 03:50:09,800
But there has been a change of schedule!

7148
03:50:09,800 --> 03:50:10,160
Oh shit.

7149
03:50:10,320 --> 03:50:10,520
Okay.

7150
03:50:10,740 --> 03:50:11,300
So...

7151
03:50:12,360 --> 03:50:14,160
This is the new schedule now.

7152
03:50:15,240 --> 03:50:18,280
We changed it to fit people's...

7153
03:50:18,280 --> 03:50:18,720
We changed it to fit people's...

7154
03:50:18,720 --> 03:50:19,580
Other people's schedule.

7155
03:50:19,960 --> 03:50:22,700
So Resident Evil 4 and Hufo-Ban...

7156
03:50:22,720 --> 03:50:24,720
Are both swapped now.

7157
03:50:25,620 --> 03:50:26,060
So...

7158
03:50:27,080 --> 03:50:27,960
Over here...

7159
03:50:27,960 --> 03:50:29,600
Tomorrow it's Hufobia.

7160
03:50:30,180 --> 03:50:32,380
And then for those who are like, what the fuck is Hufobia?

7161
03:50:32,480 --> 03:50:33,600
It's basically like...

7162
03:50:34,060 --> 03:50:36,460
You play as either a hunter or deers.

7163
03:50:36,740 --> 03:50:38,360
And then the hunter...

7164
03:50:38,360 --> 03:50:40,400
Has to like try to kill the deers.

7165
03:50:40,460 --> 03:50:41,720
And it's not just like three deers.

7166
03:50:41,740 --> 03:50:42,640
There's like lots of deers.

7167
03:50:42,780 --> 03:50:45,620
And the deers have to pretend to be deers.

7168
03:50:45,760 --> 03:50:46,520
And like...

7169
03:50:46,520 --> 03:50:47,720
Beat the shit out of the hunter.

7170
03:50:48,320 --> 03:50:48,760
So...

7171
03:50:51,600 --> 03:50:52,480
So like...

7172
03:50:52,720 --> 03:50:53,760
That's basically it.

7173
03:50:53,920 --> 03:50:55,580
So it's like deers versus hunters.

7174
03:50:56,400 --> 03:50:58,120
Inside you are two deers.

7175
03:50:58,360 --> 03:51:00,060
Yeah, I've been wanting to play that game for a while.

7176
03:51:00,300 --> 03:51:01,360
But I like...

7177
03:51:01,360 --> 03:51:02,560
There was like no multiplayer.

7178
03:51:02,800 --> 03:51:04,420
But then they recently added...

7179
03:51:04,420 --> 03:51:06,500
There was multiplayer.

7180
03:51:06,920 --> 03:51:08,140
But there's no private servers.

7181
03:51:08,480 --> 03:51:11,100
But they recently added private servers now.

7182
03:51:11,300 --> 03:51:13,280
So like... I'm looking forward to it.

7183
03:51:13,960 --> 03:51:14,600
So...

7184
03:51:15,800 --> 03:51:17,560
So that's Hufobia.

7185
03:51:17,900 --> 03:51:19,900
And then obviously Resident Evil 4...

7186
03:51:19,900 --> 03:51:22,440
I saw people asking if it was the original or the remake.

7187
03:51:22,660 --> 03:51:24,500
I will be playing the remake.

7188
03:51:24,780 --> 03:51:26,340
Because I don't want to restart it.

7189
03:51:26,460 --> 03:51:28,860
I don't want to go back from the beginning.

7190
03:51:29,340 --> 03:51:30,520
I don't want to go back from the beginning.

7191
03:51:30,520 --> 03:51:31,400
From the original.

7192
03:51:31,800 --> 03:51:34,020
I don't want to replay the original.

7193
03:51:34,360 --> 03:51:36,820
So we're going to be playing the remake.

7194
03:51:37,180 --> 03:51:40,280
So at least we can finish it this time.

7195
03:51:40,720 --> 03:51:42,440
So at least we can finish it this time.

7196
03:51:44,140 --> 03:51:44,740
So...

7197
03:51:46,120 --> 03:51:46,720
Anyway...

7198
03:51:46,720 --> 03:51:47,440
Anyway...

7199
03:51:47,440 --> 03:51:49,180
That is the current schedule.

7200
03:51:49,560 --> 03:51:50,380
Anyway guys!

7201
03:51:50,640 --> 03:51:52,060
I hope you guys had a great time.

7202
03:51:52,660 --> 03:51:54,760
I'm so happy we made it to the finals.

7203
03:51:55,220 --> 03:51:58,240
I honestly did not expect us to make it to the finals.

7204
03:51:58,940 --> 03:51:59,500
And...

7205
03:52:00,360 --> 03:52:03,480
It's hard being the extroverted introvert.

7206
03:52:03,960 --> 03:52:04,520
Because...

7207
03:52:06,620 --> 03:52:09,400
I tried my best to be social.

7208
03:52:10,000 --> 03:52:11,760
Amongst Apex streamers.

7209
03:52:11,900 --> 03:52:16,500
Because that is very difficult to do when you are the most social person.

7210
03:52:16,520 --> 03:52:16,700
Because that is very difficult to do when you are the most social person.

7211
03:52:16,720 --> 03:52:18,240
As the introvert.

7212
03:52:18,420 --> 03:52:18,880
So...

7213
03:52:23,520 --> 03:52:23,980
So...

7214
03:52:23,980 --> 03:52:25,580
I tried my best.

7215
03:52:26,660 --> 03:52:27,120
Anyway...

7216
03:52:27,120 --> 03:52:28,860
Thank you everybody for coming.

7217
03:52:29,060 --> 03:52:30,820
As always everybody stay hydrated.

7218
03:52:31,060 --> 03:52:33,660
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7219
03:52:34,280 --> 03:52:34,740
And...

7220
03:52:34,740 --> 03:52:35,600
You said it for me.

7221
03:52:35,760 --> 03:52:36,460
Head to bed.

7222
03:52:36,600 --> 03:52:37,560
Because you deserve it.

7223
03:52:37,620 --> 03:52:38,580
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

7224
03:52:38,880 --> 03:52:39,380
Bye guys!
