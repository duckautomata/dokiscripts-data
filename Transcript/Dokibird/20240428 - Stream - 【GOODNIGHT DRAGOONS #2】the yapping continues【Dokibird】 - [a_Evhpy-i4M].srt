1
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,020
Waaaaaah!

2
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,400
Guys, it's not donation reading.

3
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:53,760
Sorry.

4
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,480
Wait!

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,580
Wrong room!

6
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:55,940
Sorry!

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,940
Give me a sec.

8
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,300
Waaaaaah!

9
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,840
Okay, we're in the right room now.

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,300
Sorry.

11
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,040
Guys, I already forgot what room we were in.

12
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,540
Sorry.

13
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,740
I already forgot what room we were in for these streams, guys.

14
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,760
Hello, everybody!

15
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,920
Hello, hello!

16
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,940
So scu- Oh my gosh.

17
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,160
It wouldn't be a Doki Bird stream without a little bit of scum.

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,100
I'm so sorry.

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,180
Today's been...

20
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,020
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

21
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,860
Alright, I'm not gonna...

22
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,360
I'm not gonna like sugarcoat it.

23
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,460
I won't... I won't like, you know...

24
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,520
I won't lie.

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,220
Today... Today was really rough.

26
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,140
I'll say it.

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,960
I had a really, really rough day.

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,240
Today... Today was really rough.

29
00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:01,360
But the one thing I looked forward to today, though, was being able to hang out with you dragoons.

30
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:10,280
Cause not gonna lie, even though I had a really rough day, I always look forward to streaming for you guys.

31
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,320
Because you guys make it all better.

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,680
And like, I always feel happy whenever I'm streaming for you guys.

33
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,560
And, it's just I just love like hanging out with my dragoons.

34
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,380
Cause you guys always make me so happy.

35
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,400
And like forget about the troubles and stuff.

36
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,700
It also helps a lot because it's like...

37
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,420
I get to like... Not worry about the stuff that made the day rough.

38
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,620
It's a little... I guess it's a little like...

39
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,820
Pause on like the real world shit going outside.

40
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,300
Sorry.

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,860
It's like, you know...

42
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,420
You know, like, oh if I stream right now, I don't have... and I keep streaming.

43
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't have to worry about what's gonna going on until I stop my stream and then it's back to having a rough time.

44
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,480
It's like a symbiotic escapism.

45
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:11,980
Yeah.

46
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,620
Yeah.

47
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,580
It's just a really rough day today.

49
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,540
Just a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and stuff.

50
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,580
I think okay.

51
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:56,260
I had like I think like one of the reasons why it was like super rough was because like okay.

52
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,800
This is a little personal.

53
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,060
It's a little personal.

54
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,560
But like I did have like a little argument.

55
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,640
Okay, maybe it wasn't that little.

56
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,600
Maybe it wasn't that little but I had an argument.

57
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,920
With my parents about some things.

58
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,900
So that's why it was like super rough and...

59
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,300
It's a little bit better now.

60
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,420
But yeah, that's why I was like, oh I can't wait to just stream.

61
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:31,740
Stream because then I can like escape from it and just spend time with my dragoons.

62
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,460
It's never fun.

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,540
Whenever you argue with your parents, it's never a fun time.

64
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,500
Because you're just like no.

65
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,020
And you're like yeah.

66
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,200
And they're like no.

67
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,600
And I'm like I'm going to my room.

68
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,550
And then you know like you go to your room and you're like and then you refuse to go out your room.

69
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,830
Because when you go out your room they win.

70
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,670
You know.

71
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,630
You know.

72
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,010
When you have those types of things.

73
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,390
And then you're like oh I want to.

74
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,830
And so guys I have not went out of my room yet.

75
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,410
But then eventually you have to eventually go out of your room.

76
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,610
And then you and your parents pretend nothing happened.

77
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,690
And then when you finally...

78
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,450
And then oh yeah you have to come out to either eat or use the bathroom.

79
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,870
And then when you finally do come out.

80
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,390
You have to go to your room.

81
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,790
You pretend nothing happened.

82
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,170
And then it's like you never had that argument in the first place.

83
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,270
And then...

84
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,250
And it's like the awkward silence.

85
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,530
And then they'll be like what do you want to eat?

86
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,510
And then you're just like I don't care.

87
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,230
And then...

88
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,890
And then the next day everything will just be fine.

89
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,130
You know thank you for the super chat.

90
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:13,450
Thank you.

91
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,810
Thank you.

92
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,690
I hope you have a better day tomorrow.

93
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,250
Thank you.

94
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,970
Thank you for the super chat.

95
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,270
Thank you.

96
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,350
Of course yeah me too.

97
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,790
Obviously I hope I do have a better day tomorrow.

98
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,730
James thank you for the super chat.

99
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,070
Thank you.

100
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,470
Thank you.

101
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,450
Thank you.

102
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,730
Thank you.

103
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,930
The feeling is mutual.

104
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,350
Thank you.

105
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,110
Thank you.

106
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:32,990
Thank you for the super chat.

107
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,330
Thank you.

108
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,670
Yeah the social research.

109
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,510
Just parents things.

110
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,010
That's why you should never have kids.

111
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,470
Unless your kids subscribe to me.

112
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,550
Anyway.

113
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,990
That's why you should never have kids.

114
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,730
Unless those kids will become Doki Bird subscribers.

115
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,910
Then that's fine.

116
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,510
But other than that.

117
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,670
Because then you know when you have kids.

118
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,890
That's going to happen to you too.

119
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,090
Where you're going to have the same thing.

120
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,590
Those exact same arguments.

121
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,330
And then you'll realize.

122
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,390
Oh my god my parents were right.

123
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,730
I was a piece of shit.

124
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,410
But for now I want to think that I'm right.

125
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,730
For now I want to think that I'm right.

126
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,210
And I don't have the knowledge.

127
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,270
Of what it's like to be a parent.

128
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,450
To realize.

129
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,110
Wow.

130
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,270
My fucking kid is a piece of shit.

131
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,910
I do not want to enforce.

132
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,130
The circle of life right now.

133
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,270
I like to live with the ignorance.

134
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,770
That I am the perfect child.

135
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,810
Thank you for the super chat.

136
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,110
Thank you.

137
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,630
Thank you.

138
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,190
I'm glad that streaming and hanging out with the dragoons.

139
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,670
Helps you get away from the stress.

140
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,530
Thank you for the super chat.

141
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:49,930
Thank you.

142
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,490
Thank you.

143
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,190
I quit the cycle.

144
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:56,970
Um.

145
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,290
But yeah.

146
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,350
I hope the music isn't.

147
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,130
Too loud guys.

148
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,250
I hope the lo-fi is.

149
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:05,910
Comfy.

150
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,570
I really like doing these.

151
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,090
I know this is only my second stream.

152
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,990
On the late night radio.

153
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,810
The late night radio shows.

154
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,470
But I'm honestly already starting to.

155
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,530
Really enjoy it.

156
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,670
Because it's just.

157
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,390
It's just a nice time to just hang out.

158
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,730
Like be real with you guys.

159
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,630
Just talking.

160
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,770
And having a conversation.

161
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:29,990
With my dragoons.

162
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,110
And it's always a nice time.

163
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,090
And I hope that it helps with your sleep.

164
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,150
Or it's a nice like.

165
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,030
It's a nice like good morning for those people on the other side of the world.

166
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,690
I can up the music a little bit.

167
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,870
If people can't hear it.

168
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,610
I hear some people are like what music?

169
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,250
No.

170
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,090
Thank you for the super chat.

171
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,430
Thank you.

172
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:45,950
Thank you.

173
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,950
Screw YouTube for kids.

174
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,650
Subscribe to Doki Bird for all your child distracting entertainment.

175
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,110
Yes.

176
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,470
Thank you for the super chat.

177
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:51,810
Thank you.

178
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,170
Thank you.

179
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,630
If you have a child and they are becoming an iPad kid.

180
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,250
You might as well.

181
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:03,650
You might as well.

182
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,130
Like they are already fucked mentally.

183
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,330
Because they are becoming iPad kids.

184
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,530
If you guys don't know.

185
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,550
Like okay.

186
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,130
No matter what my content will always be better than Coco Melon.

187
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:15,950
Because apparently.

188
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,350
I talked about this before.

189
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,750
But Coco Melon.

190
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,030
And like a lot of like kids channels.

191
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,290
Are known to actually harm your child's brain development.

192
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,990
So no matter what.

193
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,850
I cannot be worse than that.

194
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,270
I cannot be worse than that.

195
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,650
Like.

196
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,050
At best.

197
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,350
They will learn some profanity.

198
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,910
But they were going to learn it eventually.

199
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,430
So you might as well start them off young.

200
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,990
Like you don't want them to suddenly learn it from their friends.

201
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,710
Cause like if their friends.

202
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,370
Cause then that means their friends are bad influences.

203
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,550
But if they learn from me.

204
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,950
At least you know.

205
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,090
It's not because of a bad influence.

206
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,790
It's because it's just so natural.

207
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,150
In my vocabulary.

208
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,270
That I'm not going to be a bad influence.

209
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,390
That is just part of how I speak.

210
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,170
Like.

211
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,530
Cause like.

212
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,930
You don't want your child.

213
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,070
To learn fuck.

214
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,530
From their friends.

215
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,170
Cause like.

216
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,610
What would the context be?

217
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,510
But then.

218
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,610
You know if your child learns fucking fucking.

219
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,750
From me.

220
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,970
It's just part of an expression.

221
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,730
It just means.

222
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,930
Like a lot of something.

223
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,250
So it's not.

224
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,710
Not part of whatever context.

225
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,490
Whatever bad influence.

226
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,470
That their friends are doing to your child.

227
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,990
You know for me.

228
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,430
I'm a good influence.

229
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,070
Because even though I'm stupid.

230
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,070
Um.

231
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,330
Even though I'm stupid.

232
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,990
I'm not influencing.

233
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,070
I'm not like.

234
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,210
I'm not fucking.

235
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,110
With your child's development.

236
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,030
Ten minutes passed.

237
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,490
I should be okay I think.

238
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,510
Um.

239
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,910
You did the swears.

240
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,030
And it's nine minutes.

241
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,390
Thank you for the super chat Jonathan.

242
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:03,890
Thank you.

243
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,450
Thank you.

244
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,210
Thank you for the super chat.

245
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,490
Thank you.

246
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,850
Thank you.

247
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,390
Thank you.

248
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,910
Thank you.

249
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,430
Thank you.

250
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,230
Thank you.

251
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,650
Thank you.

252
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,530
Yeah as a parent.

253
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,790
I'm thankful that the realization.

254
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,510
That used to be a rude dumb fuck.

255
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,970
Happened before I had a kid.

256
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,190
Now I'm mostly a nice dumb fuck.

257
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,950
Thank you for the super chat.

258
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,550
Thank you.

259
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,150
Look.

260
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,570
All I'm saying.

261
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,730
Is that.

262
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,930
If you have children.

263
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,710
Please make sure to have them subscribe.

264
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,390
To Doki Bird.

265
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,130
Uh.

266
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,150
So I can get a million subscribers.

267
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,570
Honestly at this rate.

268
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,970
I don't think I'm going to get a million subscribers.

269
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,570
Before the end of the year.

270
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,430
Unless I hit the algorithm hard.

271
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,730
I don't think it's possible.

272
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,610
It's.

273
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,390
It's.

274
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,390
I'm looking at like.

275
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,970
I actually calculated the.

276
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,830
Cause like okay.

277
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,370
The reason why.

278
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,510
You guys must be like wow Doki.

279
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,470
Why are you calculating.

280
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,270
When you're going to hit a million subscribers.

281
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,630
It's cause like at a million.

282
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,190
I want to make a huge.

283
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,070
I'm planning a huge project.

284
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,430
For a million.

285
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,770
But the thing is.

286
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,490
I need to know when I hit a million.

287
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,810
So I can debut this.

288
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,490
So I can pinpoint the timing of the project.

289
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,550
For a million subscribers.

290
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,570
I haven't started the plans for a million.

291
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,930
But I need to know.

292
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,450
When will I hit it.

293
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,750
So I can calculate.

294
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,770
How many months of planning.

295
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,130
I need to do for a project.

296
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,370
For a million subscribers.

297
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,590
So.

298
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,790
So that's why.

299
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,830
Like I'm trying to.

300
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,490
I need to know exactly.

301
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,330
Cause it's like oh my gosh.

302
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,850
If I like plan it advance.

303
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,730
Like way too advance.

304
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,410
And I have it done.

305
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,650
By before I hit a million.

306
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,110
But then like so many things happen.

307
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:58,990
Afterwards.

308
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,350
And I hold on to this project.

309
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,510
For like I don't know.

310
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,550
Half a year after it's completed.

311
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,030
Then it'll be outdated.

312
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,470
I don't want something to be outdated.

313
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,110
So like that's why I'm trying to like.

314
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,430
I always like try to figure out when I hit.

315
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,470
It's also like subscriber milestones too.

316
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,250
I've been trying to like figure out.

317
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,330
I think like at 800k subscribers.

318
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,990
There's something I want to do.

319
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,450
I hit 800k subscribers.

320
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,930
But like.

321
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,970
I also.

322
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,750
I'm also worried that.

323
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,050
It would take too long.

324
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,170
I'm a little worried.

325
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,970
That it's gonna take a little bit too long.

326
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,010
Because.

327
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,650
And now I'm like.

328
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,990
Oh it's gonna be so outdated.

329
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:42,510
But.

330
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,550
Like I would be like so impatient.

331
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,910
Because I would rather just debut the project.

332
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,270
That I had planned for 800k earlier.

333
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,370
Than just waiting for 800k.

334
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,050
It's just like wait.

335
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,290
I'm just like impatient.

336
00:14:59,290 --> 00:14:59,730
Like I'm just like waiting.

337
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,370
I'm very impatient on things.

338
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,030
Case in point.

339
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,910
There's like things.

340
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,670
I.

341
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,330
There's like things.

342
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,570
I told you guys.

343
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,430
There's things I watch.

344
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,510
And there's things that I like.

345
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,750
Maybe I don't play a particular game or something.

346
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,910
But I like want to know the ending of something.

347
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:19,470
Oh yeah.

348
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,450
If I play a game.

349
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,050
This is very very rare.

350
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,030
Not JK.

351
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:23,510
I lie.

352
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,690
But there's a game I haven't really played.

353
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,830
Or uh.

354
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,770
I haven't really played.

355
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,830
Or I'm not looking interested in playing.

356
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,770
But I want to know the plot or story.

357
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,190
Of the game.

358
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,010
I would actually look up the ending.

359
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,910
Because like.

360
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,790
I know I won't play it.

361
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,990
Like I know I won't play the game.

362
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:52,930
So like.

363
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:53,770
But I'd be like.

364
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,370
Oh I want to know how the.

365
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,190
It's like JRPGs.

366
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,590
But like.

367
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,330
There's like some JRPGs.

368
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,750
That like I'm curious about.

369
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,790
Like I'll be like.

370
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,210
Oh what's gonna happen.

371
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,850
What's the story.

372
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,390
And stuff like that.

373
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,770
So I just like look it up.

374
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,550
And I'll be like.

375
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,050
Oh okay.

376
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,150
But like JRPGs is such a terrible example for me.

377
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,230
Because it's so fucking long.

378
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,290
That you get sucked into a rabbit hole.

379
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,970
I think that I only done that for like.

380
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,810
One JRPG.

381
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,730
And it was for.

382
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,810
No two.

383
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,670
It was the one with the lightning.

384
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,570
With lightning as the main character.

385
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,070
And the other one was like one of the personas.

386
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,410
Because like I remember like I quit.

387
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,290
Playing the lightning one.

388
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,830
Because it was terrible.

389
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,170
Like there's nothing else I can really say.

390
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,690
Other than you know.

391
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,850
It was pretty bad.

392
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:49,990
Like.

393
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,670
I played up until.

394
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,070
I played up until like.

395
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,830
I think like.

396
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,430
I played like one to two hours.

397
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,850
And then I was like.

398
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,430
Okay.

399
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:01,770
Yeah.

400
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,370
Like this is not for me.

401
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,610
Because like I remember telling you guys.

402
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,690
Like oh these were the JRPGs I played.

403
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,370
Like Final.

404
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,230
Because you guys were like.

405
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,650
Have you ever played Final Fantasy.

406
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,370
And I was like yes.

407
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,150
There's only been two Final Fantasys that I've played and touched.

408
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,890
And like apparently.

409
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,910
One of the worst installments.

410
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,170
In Final Fantasy.

411
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,030
But they were literally the two games that I tried.

412
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,770
Like I would be like.

413
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,270
Let's give Final Fantasy a shot.

414
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,930
And then one of them was the one with the three girls.

415
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,230
I don't remember their names.

416
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,090
The one with the three girls that were the main characters.

417
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,490
And apparently that was supposed to be a sequel.

418
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,430
To the game before.

419
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,630
To the last Final Fantasy game.

420
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,870
But I played that.

421
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,070
Yeah X2.

422
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,990
That was my very first Final Fantasy game.

423
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,930
And then I tried to play it.

424
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:51,810
And I was like.

425
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,230
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

426
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,250
Because it's a sequel.

427
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,030
But I didn't realize it was a sequel.

428
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,390
I had.

429
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,230
I was very young as well.

430
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,410
So I really had like no clue.

431
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,690
It was a sequel.

432
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,770
But I was like.

433
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,210
I remember going to like EB games.

434
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,710
And then like.

435
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,650
For those who don't know what EB games.

436
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,850
It's like EA games.

437
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,510
But like B for Canadian.

438
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,490
Anyway.

439
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,350
Anyway.

440
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,570
Anyway.

441
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,830
And then I saw that.

442
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,290
I was like.

443
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,550
Dad I wanna buy this.

444
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,890
Because Final Fantasy.

445
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,150
It's everywhere.

446
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,910
And then.

447
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,050
And then.

448
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,050
And then you know.

449
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,710
I tried it.

450
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,650
Didn't know what the fuck is going on.

451
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,870
I think it's also because when I was younger.

452
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,870
I was mega illiterate.

453
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,210
Versus now.

454
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,410
Which is like illiteracy by choice.

455
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:49,990
Uh.

456
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,110
Back then.

457
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,190
It was because.

458
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,930
I was just really stupid.

459
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,870
And I was like sort of illiterate.

460
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,610
And I like didn't really know how to read.

461
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,530
But now it's by choice.

462
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,710
That I don't read.

463
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,930
And anyway.

464
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,890
Um.

465
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,590
Anyway.

466
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:11,830
Um.

467
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,610
And then a couple of years passed by.

468
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,270
Like a hundred years passed by.

469
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,630
Oh my god Doki.

470
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,630
How old are you?

471
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,950
A hundred years passed.

472
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,390
It felt like a hundred years.

473
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,410
And then the lightning one.

474
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,910
Final Fantasy 13.

475
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,410
That's the lightning game.

476
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,530
Came out.

477
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,570
And I was like.

478
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,010
Let me give it another shot.

479
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,770
Maybe like you know.

480
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,190
Maybe it was just the game.

481
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,330
And it wasn't me.

482
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:40,830
You know.

483
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,770
Maybe like you know.

484
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,690
Little Doki just.

485
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,390
Back then little Doki just wasn't into JRPGs.

486
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,270
And now slightly older Doki.

487
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,350
Will be okay with it.

488
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,450
Because I'm more mature.

489
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,790
And like possibly I could read a little better.

490
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:57,770
Um.

491
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,750
And possibly the more mature you are.

492
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,710
And by the way.

493
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,390
TikTok hasn't been invented yet.

494
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,170
Nor has Vine been invented yet.

495
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,010
So like my attention span.

496
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,150
Is still decent.

497
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:08,810
Uh.

498
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,450
So like.

499
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,430
I haven't got like fucked over.

500
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,890
By like the lack of an attention span.

501
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,110
Because none of the short form content.

502
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,190
Existed yet.

503
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,950
It was like long form content meta.

504
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,630
Still.

505
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,290
So like it was still let's play meta.

506
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,190
Where people would watch like one hour let's play videos.

507
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,510
Because the ten minute shit hasn't hit yet.

508
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,210
Um.

509
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:34,590
Anyway.

510
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:35,270
Uh.

511
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,510
So I was like alright.

512
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,410
The fantasy 13 came out.

513
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,450
So.

514
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,790
I was like alright.

515
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,930
Let's.

516
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,910
Oh my god.

517
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,470
Lightning.

518
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,510
Oh I saw an advertisement.

519
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,290
On about her.

520
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,290
Where she like modeled some.

521
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,430
Louis Vuitton bags.

522
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,750
And she was like a model and everything.

523
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,350
Oh my god.

524
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,190
It can't be that bad.

525
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,390
Hahahaha.

526
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,710
Hahahaha.

527
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,210
Anyway.

528
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,710
So I tried.

529
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,890
I tried Final Fantasy 13.

530
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,210
And.

531
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,070
And then obviously.

532
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,430
We all know the reputation.

533
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,190
Of Final Fantasy 13.

534
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,390
Hahahaha.

535
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,950
But at that time.

536
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,690
I was like maybe it's just me.

537
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:24,730
Hahahaha.

538
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,410
You know.

539
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,330
Maybe I was like I didn't know it was considered.

540
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,270
Bad bad.

541
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,830
Because also at that time I didn't really look at reviews.

542
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,270
I was just like.

543
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,870
It was just like.

544
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,050
Experience wise.

545
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,010
So I stopped after.

546
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,590
I think like after like.

547
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,390
Like one to two hours.

548
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,370
I stopped and I was like.

549
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,030
Oh man.

550
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,790
Final Fantasy.

551
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,370
Is just sucks for me.

552
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,230
Hahahaha.

553
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,050
Hahahaha.

554
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,730
I was just like.

555
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,310
Oh man Final Fantasy.

556
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,250
Maybe it's just sucks.

557
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,030
Hahahaha.

558
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,430
Hahahaha.

559
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,970
And then.

560
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,430
After that.

561
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,650
I never touched.

562
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,110
I think like after that.

563
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,290
I never like touched JRPGs again.

564
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,810
Oh no that's a lie.

565
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,790
I tried to play Persona as well.

566
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,790
And then I realized.

567
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,370
I think like after I played Persona.

568
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,830
And I tried to play the Persona.

569
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,890
The one that came out on the Playstation.

570
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,210
Hahahaha.

571
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,570
And then.

572
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,290
Um.

573
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,110
After.

574
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,910
Okay but like what are the odds.

575
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,370
That would play two of the.

576
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,690
Two of the worst.

577
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,510
Like games in the franchise.

578
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,510
Like.

579
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,310
What were the fucking odds.

580
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,990
That that would be me.

581
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,130
Hahahaha.

582
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,230
It's like similar.

583
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,550
It's like similar.

584
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,670
Similar to how.

585
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,110
I told you guys.

586
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,050
For some fucking reason.

587
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,430
I managed to watch.

588
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,490
Two.

589
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,090
I've only been to two.

590
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,830
Cirque du Soleil shows.

591
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,970
And for some fucking reason.

592
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,790
I managed.

593
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,430
To watch the same show.

594
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,890
Twice.

595
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,930
From Cirque du Soleil.

596
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,990
How?

597
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,330
There was a 15 plus year gap.

598
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,830
Between two.

599
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,130
Both of those shows.

600
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,290
But it happened to be the same show.

601
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,730
I couldn't believe it.

602
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,610
Hahahaha.

603
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:27,910
Hahahaha.

604
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,030
For those who didn't hear the story.

605
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,870
I told this story.

606
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,310
On the stream.

607
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,570
I think with.

608
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,610
With Gumi.

609
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,290
And what happened.

610
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,250
Was that when I was really young.

611
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,570
I went to see a Cirque du Soleil show.

612
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,790
And it was this show.

613
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,690
I remember it very well.

614
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,690
Because I bought the soundtrack of it.

615
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,750
I bought the soundtrack of the show.

616
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,670
And so I was like.

617
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,510
Oh shit.

618
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:54,970
Hell yeah.

619
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,110
I fucking listened to that on my fucking.

620
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,070
Iphone.

621
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,430
It was in my iTunes.

622
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,450
And my Iphone.

623
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,150
So I remember the song so well.

624
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,110
Because it was like 15 plus years.

625
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,190
Of listening to that song.

626
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,210
To those songs.

627
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,910
When they play on shuffle.

628
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,610
And then.

629
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,210
Like 15 plus years later.

630
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,270
I realized.

631
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,490
Oh my god.

632
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,970
Maybe not even 15.

633
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,010
I swear it could be longer.

634
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,930
It could be 20 years.

635
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,910
Honestly I will not be.

636
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,490
Oh my gosh.

637
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,950
I don't even know how long.

638
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,350
And I need you guys to know.

639
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,030
How many shows Cirque du Soleil has.

640
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,510
Cirque.

641
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,750
I'm going to look it up right now.

642
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,890
Cirque du Soleil.

643
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,710
That shit pissed me off so much.

644
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,530
I couldn't believe it.

645
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,970
Because I bought VIP.

646
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,370
I bought like front row seats.

647
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,910
For the second one.

648
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,030
Just to re-watch the same thing.

649
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,290
Blade Wing.

650
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,290
Thank you for the Akasupa.

651
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,050
Thank you.

652
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,590
Thank you.

653
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,230
Thank you for some fucking reason.

654
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,830
You happen to be the best Vtuber in the world.

655
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,310
And I can't fucking believe it.

656
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,690
So keep doing what you do forever.

657
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,250
Thank you for the Akasupa.

658
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:01,830
Thank you.

659
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,570
Thank you.

660
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,490
I really appreciate that you think that way of me.

661
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,230
Alright.

662
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,210
Now I need to look.

663
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,130
I need to tell you guys.

664
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,210
Because I looked it up.

665
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,830
I couldn't believe it.

666
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,190
I actually looked this up.

667
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,810
Because I was like.

668
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,310
I couldn't fucking believe.

669
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,270
That I managed to re-watch this fucking show.

670
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,330
That I managed to re-watch this fucking show.

671
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,930
I couldn't fucking believe it.

672
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,510
I like counted too.

673
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,990
I was like.

674
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,970
How many shows have they done?

675
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,670
And they've done like.

676
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,850
I remember counting it.

677
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,190
I looked up on the Wikipedia.

678
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,630
And I literally counted how many shows they've done.

679
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,090
They've done.

680
00:25:49,910 --> 00:26:05,060
They've done 53 different shows.

681
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,590
And I somehow managed to watch the same one twice.

682
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,610
And I somehow managed to watch the same one twice.

683
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,510
I, it pissed me off so.

684
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,530
Okay anyway as I saying.

685
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,530
So yeah so I bought.

686
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,490
Like I was like.

687
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,190
I haven't seen Cirque du Soleil in so fucking long.

688
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,990
Like modern times.

689
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,290
So I was like.

690
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,070
Oh shit.

691
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,610
I'm gonna go watch Cirque du Soleil.

692
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,210
Because obviously I would think it'd be a new show.

693
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,990
If it's touring again.

694
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,950
So...

695
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,610
They're touring again!

696
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,270
They always- they tour so much and they always come up with new things!

697
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:59,250
So how the fuck was I supposed to know that they will redo the same thing 15 years- 15 to 20 years ago?

698
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:16,850
Anyway, so yeah I remember I paid for the the one of the more really expensive tickets because I wanted to be at the front at the front because I hate sitting in the back because like My eyes aren't as good as it used to be and I know I wear glass Okay,

699
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:35,130
not- okay, it might not look like I'm wearing glasses right now But like when I watch things I wear my glasses like yeah, like you I can still see it But like I like seeing their- their like I could like seeing their Expressions and their faces because usually there's no second or third screen because it's a circus If you guys don't know but yeah,

700
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:51,750
I paid for a fucking rerun uh Like for Cirque du Soleil, they don't have like additional screens where you can zoom in on the faces and stuff Like you it's just like if you sit in the back, it's just little fucking stick figures So I didn't want to see that I was like,

701
00:27:51,810 --> 00:28:20,770
I really want like like experience the circus and like Experience like what they're what they're feeling when they're performing and so I was like I ain't buying the back seats I'm buying the front seats because I don't want to see fucking seats I don't want to see like the big stick figures trying to perform stuff because it's not as impressive when they're so far away Like I might as well just watch it on TV because at least a TV or DVD or the YouTube video has like close-ups Like okay,

702
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:37,530
this is my opinion but like I rather just watch if I'm gonna watch something live I rather have watch it like in the front rather than the back unless it's like a huge concert thing I don't know I think like concerts that's sort of different because For con- performances,

703
00:28:38,010 --> 00:29:15,990
it's a different story But like concerts I'm fine with concerts if I'm sitting in that back cuz it's all about the music and like there's usually like screens or close-ups and stuff of The performances, but if it's like musicals entertainment Circuses stuff like that They usually don't have an extra screen where you can like see what's going on close up So like if I if I rather just sit in the front where I can see what the fuck is going on Then the back cuz if I can't do that I might as well just watch the thing on TV or like watch it on YouTube Anyway

704
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:47,710
So yeah, I bought I got this in the front and I heard the first song I heard the- I even bought like overpriced pretzels and coke too I even spent money on overpriced concert food and Cuz that pretzel was so fucking dry and it was like 15 Canadian dollars so for you Americans,

705
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,750
it's like five dollars

706
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:57,370
So you Americans out there it's like nothing for you guys but for us it's like 15 Canadian

707
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:21,730
Anyway, I bought a fucking- I bought an overpriced dry as fuck pretzel and And an overpriced bottle of coke just so watch a rerun and I was so fucking mad

708
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:31,230
I heard the first song and I was like wait I know this song.

709
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,250
Why do I know this song?

710
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:41,950
And shit like I was like I was like in denial at first I was like I'm still coping and being like, why do I know this song?

711
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,610
There's no way I know this song.

712
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:50,950
And then after like the first 30 seconds, I was like, oh my god, no, no.

713
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,460
So...

714
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,960
So yeah, I was in denial and then I was like bargaining and then anger.

715
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,360
I'm sort of still like in... I'm still sort of like going through the five stages of grief at the moment.

716
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,320
It's been months, but I'm still going through the five stages of grief by the way.

717
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,940
I felt so betrayed, chat.

718
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,580
I felt so fucking betrayed.

719
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,960
But yes, I feel like I'm just a very unlucky person.

720
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,560
Sometimes I feel like okay, I'm either like...

721
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,720
I'm either... I'm so... I know, I know.

722
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,820
I am very unlucky.

723
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,640
I'm incredibly unlucky person and a...

724
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,180
Time?

725
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,300
Sometimes I'm like lucky is because I like work for it.

726
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:52,480
When I get something or like if something good happens to me is because I work so hard that it counteracts my unluckiness.

727
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,300
I feel...

728
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,300
Hanta, thank you for the super chat.

729
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,760
Thank you.

730
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,380
Thank you.

731
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,300
Have you ever thought you're really really clumsy?

732
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,000
Like that's a talent in the worst ways, man.

733
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,720
Thank you for the super chat.

734
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,140
Thank you.

735
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,720
Thank you.

736
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,340
Delta, thank you for the super chat.

737
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:14,680
Thank you.

738
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,040
Thank you.

739
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,260
Some locations across the world do specific shows only.

740
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,100
No, no.

741
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,940
The Cirque du Soleil's I've seen were the touring ones.

742
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,120
That's the worst part.

743
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,660
Like coincidentally, all the Cirque du Soleil...

744
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,880
Like the two Cirque du Soleil shows I watched were the ones that they decided to tour in my city.

745
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,000
And that was the worst part.

746
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,120
Just the touring shows.

747
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,620
So 15 years?

748
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,300
The touring show is this... yeah.

749
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,340
50 to 20 years!

750
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,400
They decided to tour again?

751
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,540
Anyway, Delta.

752
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,960
Oh yeah, I already said that.

753
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,720
Thank you for the super chat.

754
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,100
Thank you.

755
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,680
Thank you.

756
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,520
If we watch something twice, are we then the blooms?

757
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:06,980
13 years.

758
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,360
Thank you for the super chat.

759
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:08,980
Thank you.

760
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,640
Thank you.

761
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,240
Yeah, I don't think I'll ever be able to see a new Cirque du Soleil.

762
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,880
Now I'm afraid.

763
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,060
Because I don't remember the name of the show I watched.

764
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,280
The worst part is that I actually don't remember the show that I watched.

765
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,360
And I feel like if I try to watch Cirque du Soleil again for the third fucking time...

766
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,300
I'm gonna just pay... I'm gonna...

767
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,960
I will not be surprised if it's the third fucking time.

768
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,540
It's the third time.

769
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,680
Mahk me welcome to the...

770
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,440
Welcome back to the tomato farm.

771
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,200
Welcome back.

772
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,200
That's a me problem.

773
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Let's see...

774
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,000
But yeah anyway, that's what I'm saying like...

775
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,300
Oh my gosh, how did I get to this fucking tangent?

776
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,260
Oh, yeah, it's because of my...

777
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,380
It's because of how unlucky I was for...

778
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,920
Oh my god!

779
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,080
Anyway, I don't know if you guys know this.

780
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,040
I tweeted this out.

781
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,700
I tweeted this out, but like...

782
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,720
There was like major fucking leaks in the animation...

783
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,700
In the animation sector.

784
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,620
So for those who don't know...

785
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,360
I really, really love animation and like animated shows.

786
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:43,240
I watched a lot of them over the years.

787
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,700
Because I honestly...

788
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,000
Especially for drama stuff, for drama shows...

789
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,800
I cannot do live action drama shows quite well.

790
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,980
Because I just get so depressed.

791
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,100
And...

792
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,140
I get so depressed.

793
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,540
And like I'm already...

794
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,220
You know, I'm already having a rough time.

795
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:03,880
Like...

796
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,280
I...

797
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,280
It's why like I said this before...

798
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,580
But I normally watch like comedies, animation...

799
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,880
Or like just things that are like super light-hearted.

800
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,280
And I tend to avoid drama stuff.

801
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,580
And like I usually avoid like gore and things.

802
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,860
Like I actually...

803
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,500
I hate the gore in Invincible.

804
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,880
I hate it so much.

805
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,620
But like I understand like...

806
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,880
In the show...

807
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,960
Like it needs that.

808
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,400
But like I always look away when the gore is coming in for Invincible.

809
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,120
Because I can't handle that stuff.

810
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,300
Like I actually look away.

811
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,400
And like...

812
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,400
And wait until it's over.

813
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,780
Because like I'm like bro, life is already very depressing.

814
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,420
And I don't...

815
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,880
I don't need more of that.

816
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,660
And like...

817
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,440
Oh my...

818
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,260
Okay, also I...

819
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,060
I don't understand people who complain.

820
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,120
The thing is...

821
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,240
Okay, you guys don't know this.

822
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,080
But for those...

823
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,300
Like some people might not know this.

824
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,720
I actually read the Invincible comics.

825
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,540
And I didn't finish reading it.

826
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
I think I read like...

827
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,240
I read the ending of the comics for Invincible.

828
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,780
And I read like...

829
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,520
I think like a couple of chapters in the beginning of Invincible.

830
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,500
But...

831
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,200
Anyway...

832
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,780
And like I know like the major plot points in the comics too.

833
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,060
So like I know like what's gonna happen in the comics.

834
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,340
But anyway...

835
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,140
Um...

836
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,300
Apparently...

837
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,280
People who like read the Invincible comics...

838
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,900
They were complaining about how little the gore was.

839
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,260
I was like...

840
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,520
Are you fucking kidding?

841
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,760
They were like...

842
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,080
You guys toned it down so much.

843
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,180
And I'm like...

844
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,580
What?

845
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,840
What do you mean?

846
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,180
I was just like...

847
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,600
You want more?

848
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,940
But if we had more...

849
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:06,340
The fucking ratings for that show would be like R18 at that point.

850
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,840
Wait is it Invincible?

851
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,660
Okay what is Invincible's rating?

852
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,600
Invincible...

853
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,380
Rating...

854
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:13,700
Uh...

855
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,500
Ratings for...

856
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,640
Uh...

857
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,400
What is it?

858
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,160
Parental rating?

859
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,800
I don't even know what it's called.

860
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,280
Oh it's mature.

861
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,740
Yeah that's not even R18.

862
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,460
It's mature.

863
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,180
But like I'm pretty sure...

864
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,540
If we go further...

865
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,920
It would have been like...

866
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,500
R...

867
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,160
R...

868
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,500
It would have been like R18.

869
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,920
I was like...

870
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,460
It was already too much for me.

871
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,060
And like they added moments in there.

872
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,240
They added in there.

873
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,980
That was like...

874
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,500
I was like...

875
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,400
What the fuck?

876
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,400
Yeah they said like...

877
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,680
The people were complaining.

878
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,800
The like hardcore comic readers...

879
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,560
Were complaining that like...

880
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,120
They didn't go like hard enough.

881
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,880
And I was just like...

882
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,360
Are you...

883
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,800
What?

884
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,860
What do you...

885
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,660
I...

886
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,040
I was like...

887
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,160
Bro I wish they toned it down.

888
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,040
I was like...

889
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,160
Bro I...

890
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,020
What do you mean?

891
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,580
It was...

892
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,640
Oh my...

893
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:16,860
I...

894
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,780
Like...

895
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,680
Bro...

896
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,600
Sometimes I wanna eat when I watch this show.

897
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,800
Like...

898
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,760
Like...

899
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:23,820
I...

900
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,000
I...

901
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,680
I...

902
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,100
I...

903
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,780
Sometimes...

904
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,100
Sometimes I want...

905
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Yeah but like...

906
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,540
M for Mature is...

907
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,480
Isn't M for Mature...

908
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,320
Like...

909
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,880
Less than R18?

910
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,020
Cause like R18 is like a different...

911
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,320
Isn't it go like...

912
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,380
Uh...

913
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,440
Um...

914
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,000
What was it?

915
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,160
Parental Rating Guide.

916
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,580
Okay I need to look at the Parental Rating Guide.

917
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,900
I'm pretty sure 18 is the top.

918
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,260
And then Mature is below that.

919
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,660
That's for video games?

920
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,680
There's different rating guides?

921
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:55,960
Bro...

922
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,680
I can't keep up with this.

923
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,740
Like...

924
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,620
I can't...

925
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,200
Why can't it be universal?

926
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,700
I don't understand.

927
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,940
I...

928
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,840
Like...

929
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,000
Why can't just things be universal?

930
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,480
Just like how...

931
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,420
How English is like one of the universal languages.

932
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,980
We don't want like English 2.

933
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,620
Oh wait...

934
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,220
British is English 2.

935
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,940
And that is why the British aren't the universal language.

936
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,320
This is why!

937
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,480
This is why we don't acknowledge British English and every time we're like how do you spell this?

938
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,100
Okay that's not true because...

939
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,120
Is it f***ed up for me to say that like that's not true because the UK has...

940
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,520
UK has sort of forced a lot of other countries to adopt the way of spelling in the UK like color.

941
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,860
Like okay, like in Canada we spell color with C-O-L-O-U-R.

942
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,640
But I feel like we've sort of stopped doing that because people make fun of us.

943
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,600
Like the Americans make fun of us whenever we do spell color that way.

944
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,620
We spell it that way because I don't spell it like that anymore.

945
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:21,980
I've like assimilated into like Into like mainstream universal English.

946
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,480
I feel like the Americans are wrong.

947
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,360
Anyway, why the fuck is there different?

948
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,220
There is?

949
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,480
There's video games, movies, television, music, com- There's- what?

950
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,080
There's a max rate?

951
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,440
Okay, that's funny.

952
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,340
In comic books instead of like Mature, it's max.

953
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,640
Like for explicit content.

954
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,420
That's pretty- Okay, that's That's funny that they don't even say mature.

955
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,380
It's like Max com...

956
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,200
Max explicit content, alright.

957
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,380
Okay, so in video games, it's Adults only with the A.

958
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:10,380
It's mature and then A for adults only and then for a television That it's mature audience.

959
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,220
Oh shit!

960
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:11,760
Okay.

961
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,420
No.

962
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,260
Okay, so the highest is mature.

963
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,400
In Television.

964
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,900
In movies, it's restricted R and then NC-17.

965
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:21,780
Oh!

966
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,540
Oh!

967
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:30,600
May include violence, sex, behaviors, or any other elements that most parents would consider too mature for viewing by their children.

968
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,500
Alright!

969
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,860
That's good to know.

970
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,240
I wish it was universal.

971
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,800
Because it makes it so much more complicated.

972
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,600
Yeah, that's just way too complicated in my opinion.

973
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,160
I'd rather it just be a universal thing.

974
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,120
Because like...

975
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,520
We already have so many things to worry about, man.

976
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,100
We already have a lot of things.

977
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,220
Anyway, what was I saying?

978
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,220
How did I fucking...

979
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,580
How did I get to this topic?

980
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh my gosh, where was I?

981
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh no, my tangents have its own tangents now.

982
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,960
We're in too deep.

983
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,400
We're in too deep.

984
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,080
Oh yeah, animation.

985
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,080
Sorry.

986
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,260
I was supposed to... I was talking about animation.

987
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,460
So...

988
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,100
Recently, there has been a giant animation leak.

989
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,120
Where...

990
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,140
Somebody who... I don't know.

991
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:40,960
Some fucking insider at Disney basically leaked a lot of pilots, a lot of scripts, a lot of like, pitch bibles, and a lot of like, canceled show episodes.

992
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,820
On like, anonymous forums.

993
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,860
And it was... Okay.

994
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,040
I read the story behind it.

995
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,820
It was so funny.

996
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,260
So I think like, one of the main discoverers...

997
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,580
was like, some Gravity Falls fan.

998
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,020
That was like, oh my god, guys.

999
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,940
Somebody leaked everything.

1000
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,780
On like, Twi... Like, they're like...

1001
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,920
Talking about it on Twitter.

1002
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,040
And then people were like...

1003
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,620
What?

1004
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,380
What's going on?

1005
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,080
And I was like, reading the story.

1006
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,320
Cause I was like...

1007
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,320
What... How did all this get leaked?

1008
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,740
So apparently, there was a thread.

1009
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,100
And it was on an anonymous forum.

1010
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,600
And there was a thread that was like...

1011
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,060
Um...

1012
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,680
Oh my god, here's a leak.

1013
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,400
And then some other guy was like...

1014
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,500
That's a shitty leak.

1015
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,460
Anyway...

1016
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,360
Look, here are all these other shows.

1017
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,480
These other shows that are so much better than this leak that I'm leaking.

1018
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,460
And I was like...

1019
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,660
That's...

1020
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,180
That's so fucking funny.

1021
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,840
Cause they're like...

1022
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,920
They're like...

1023
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,160
Fuck that leak.

1024
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,180
That's a shitty one.

1025
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,440
Let me show you a good leak.

1026
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,300
And then he proceeded to link...

1027
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,340
He proceeded to link...

1028
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,560
Like, link...

1029
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,400
All...

1030
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,820
Like, a bunch of like...

1031
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,080
Unaired episodes.

1032
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,960
And then later on, he was like...

1033
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,820
Even better.

1034
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,500
Here's some more links.

1035
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,740
And I was like...

1036
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:00,620
What?

1037
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,680
Oh my god.

1038
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,080
And then...

1039
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,800
And then...

1040
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,760
And then he was like...

1041
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,260
And then...

1042
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,480
They just started...

1043
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,900
Non-stop...

1044
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,400
Like...

1045
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,680
There was like a leak war.

1046
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,580
I mean, like...

1047
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,220
Who has the better Disney leak?

1048
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,380
And it was all like...

1049
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,400
Disney-centric.

1050
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:20,880
Cause like...

1051
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,220
The...

1052
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,100
The thread started talking about like...

1053
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,780
A Disney...

1054
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,560
Like an unaired Disney pilot.

1055
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,320
And...

1056
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,180
And...

1057
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,120
And then obviously Twitter found out.

1058
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,760
And was like...

1059
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,220
Oh my god.

1060
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,240
These like Twitter...

1061
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,900
Like...

1062
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,000
TV show stands found out.

1063
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:37,540
And like...

1064
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,400
Especially Gravity Falls.

1065
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,940
Cause that fucking fandom...

1066
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,420
Is very...

1067
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,080
Um...

1068
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:42,840
It's like...

1069
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,060
It's...

1070
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,340
The fact that it's still incredibly fanatic...

1071
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,400
Even after the show...

1072
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,940
Had only two seasons.

1073
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,000
If you guys didn't know...

1074
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,380
Gravity Falls technically only had...

1075
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,280
Two seasons.

1076
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,220
And...

1077
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:53,840
It...

1078
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,960
It ended...

1079
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,360
Let's see how long ago...

1080
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,380
How long did Gravity Falls end in?

1081
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,200
It ended in tw...

1082
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:03,860
What?

1083
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,440
Wait...

1084
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:05,920
What?

1085
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,500
Oh my god.

1086
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,480
Okay.

1087
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,820
It ended on...

1088
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,160
Twenty-third...

1089
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,480
Okay.

1090
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,120
2016.

1091
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,420
Oh my gosh.

1092
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,000
Is it 2016?

1093
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,020
Yeah.

1094
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,140
It ended on like...

1095
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,020
2016?

1096
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:18,980
Yeah.

1097
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,800
Really?

1098
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,420
Oh my god.

1099
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,000
I need to like...

1100
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,980
Double check my information at that point.

1101
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,200
It ended on 2016.

1102
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,920
Oh my god.

1103
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,400
Eight years.

1104
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,120
And the fandom is still going incredibly strong.

1105
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,920
And like...

1106
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,340
I'm not surprised that it was like...

1107
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,680
A Gravity Falls fan on Twitter.

1108
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,000
That made it like...

1109
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,860
That brought the attention of it.

1110
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,600
And then...

1111
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:48,960
So like...

1112
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,200
So then this...

1113
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,640
Another...

1114
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,120
So then like...

1115
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,460
People started compiling everything that came from that thread.

1116
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,560
And...

1117
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,240
They were like...

1118
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:56,920
Freaking out.

1119
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,400
And was like...

1120
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:57,740
Oh my...

1121
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,120
Anyway.

1122
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,680
So I like...

1123
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,640
Looked at the...

1124
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,080
I looked at the...

1125
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,360
There's like a folder with all of it.

1126
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,160
And...

1127
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,240
I was so sad.

1128
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,120
Because...

1129
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,360
Okay.

1130
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,960
It was actually so interesting.

1131
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:08,620
Because...

1132
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,680
It talks about like...

1133
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,900
People pitching their ideas.

1134
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,840
For...

1135
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,780
Disney pilots.

1136
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,860
For like...

1137
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,560
Disney animated pilots and stuff.

1138
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,720
And there was like...

1139
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,120
Four different people.

1140
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:18,940
And...

1141
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,420
Four animators.

1142
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,160
That tried to make DuckTales.

1143
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,000
I thought that was so interesting.

1144
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,080
Four different...

1145
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,080
Animators.

1146
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,420
Like...

1147
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,040
Four different showrunners.

1148
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,160
Try and pitch.

1149
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,560
Their own version.

1150
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,700
Of DuckTales.

1151
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,960
And I actually...

1152
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,400
I was like...

1153
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
Reading all four of them.

1154
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,720
And the one that we got was the most interesting.

1155
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,940
It was actually like...

1156
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,220
If you read the pitch bible.

1157
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,280
It was actually like...

1158
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,160
The most interesting one.

1159
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,700
And most creative one.

1160
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,080
Out of the four.

1161
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:48,940
The one that...

1162
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,220
Because I think two of them was just based off of the original show.

1163
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,200
And it was just being a continuation of the original show.

1164
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,840
I don't remember... the third one was also sort of creative.

1165
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:07,160
But the one they picked that became DuckTales, the pitch bible was like really creative.

1166
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,580
And actually put their own spin.

1167
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,680
Because it wasn't just... a lot of the DuckTales one was just a sketch and then words.

1168
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,120
And then like a huge blurb of words.

1169
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,200
And being like, blah blah blah.

1170
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,380
This show is gonna start out as blah blah blah blah blah.

1171
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:29,740
But then the one that became the DuckTales reboot that we got was like an actual comic.

1172
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,260
I was like, ooh!

1173
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,100
Majority pictures!

1174
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,300
I like that as somebody that doesn't like to read.

1175
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,620
I was like, ooh!

1176
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,120
This catches my attention.

1177
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,200
It's mature... mostly visual!

1178
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,500
Nijinai, thank you for the super chat.

1179
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,240
Thank you, thank you.

1180
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,060
I pooped a nose and now I go to sleep.

1181
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,340
Work on Sunday is always exciting.

1182
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,280
Hope you had nothing but fun and good times with chat.

1183
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:01,740
Bye bye!

1184
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,660
Also feel old because the PS2 is 24 years old this year.

1185
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,480
Thank you for the super chat.

1186
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,120
Thank you, thank you.

1187
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:12,020
Oh my god, the PS2 has graduated university and is trying to look for its first job.

1188
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,300
Oh my god.

1189
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,940
Okay, but it was actually interesting.

1190
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,560
It was so interesting because they got really creative with their pitch bible.

1191
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:28,440
Anyway, within the leaks, there was also Darkwing Duck as well.

1192
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:35,860
And there was also Darkwing Duck and it was also like saying...

1193
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,800
Because it was going to be a reboot of Darkwing Duck.

1194
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,700
And it was going to be like a spiritual...

1195
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,280
It was going to be like a reboot of Darkwing Duck and it was going to be like a spiritual...

1196
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,600
It was going to like follow up from DuckTales.

1197
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,600
But apparently that got shelved and cancelled.

1198
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,060
If you guys didn't know, I was tweeting about it also.

1199
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:55,100
But like Disney animation is known to only make three seasons.

1200
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:03,080
Because like for them, analytic wise and research wise, uh when they...

1201
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:08,640
Three seasons is like the maximum that Disney will usually go in terms of like financing.

1202
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:13,240
Because they're really scared that by season four, uh...

1203
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,420
They're really scared that season four will lose money.

1204
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,440
And...

1205
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,360
Three seasons to them, they think is like the optimal lifespan for any animated show.

1206
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:28,780
Um...

1207
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,660
Because it's like they don't know how...

1208
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,640
They don't want to go to four.

1209
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,360
Because they don't think they make profit.

1210
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,500
Uh...

1211
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,060
Thank you for the super chat.

1212
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:37,380
Thank you.

1213
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:37,960
Thank you.

1214
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,020
You call that a leak?

1215
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,620
This is a leak.

1216
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:42,740
Yeah.

1217
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,120
And like the thing...

1218
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,100
Okay, the thing I don't understand is that a lot of the...

1219
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,940
Okay, the thing is...

1220
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,140
It really sucks too.

1221
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,060
Because a lot of these shows, they do really well with like...

1222
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,940
Queens and up.

1223
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,720
I'll say.

1224
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,260
Kids don't like these shows.

1225
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,700
You can say like kids are not like a super huge fan of like the shows that we considered we would like.

1226
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,900
Like Gravity Falls was really good.

1227
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,200
I really liked Gravity Falls.

1228
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,800
I really liked The Owl House.

1229
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,080
I really liked...

1230
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,540
Star Vs.

1231
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,440
The Forces of Evil.

1232
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,720
But we don't talk about the last season.

1233
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,160
Okay, apparently people blame Star Vs.

1234
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:26,260
The Forces of Evil last season 4 as the one the main reason why they don't do season 4 anymore.

1235
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,860
There won't...

1236
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,680
There won't be reasons This is why they don't let us do season 4.

1237
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,020
Because...

1238
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,180
Stars vs.

1239
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,980
The Forces of Evil got a season 4.

1240
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,060
And like they lost a lot of money.

1241
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,740
So it like backed up Disney's ideas of like we never do a season 4.

1242
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,400
Because look at what they did.

1243
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,440
Like look at what they did in season 4.

1244
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,180
Do you want your show to be like that?

1245
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,460
So they...

1246
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,580
And someone... I remember like when I tweeted it out.

1247
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,000
So I was like, oh it wasn't cancelled.

1248
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,040
They never had a plan to do season 4.

1249
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:14,740
They actually did.

1250
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,840
It's just that it was super common knowledge for the animation team.

1251
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,800
Like in Disney.

1252
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,480
To know that...

1253
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,560
To know that...

1254
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,500
Most shows tend to not get a season 4.

1255
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,760
That they had like a backup plan.

1256
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,640
Because like they had a backup plan to being like...

1257
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:32,900
Okay.

1258
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,660
If we don't get renewed...

1259
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,320
If we don't get renewed...

1260
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,320
Then like this is how we're gonna end it.

1261
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,020
If our show doesn't get renewed.

1262
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,720
Like this is always gonna be how we're gonna end this show.

1263
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,920
And it felt like...

1264
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,680
I honestly felt like it was super rushed too.

1265
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:47,620
And...

1266
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,260
And...

1267
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,680
And even then the animation team was like...

1268
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,480
Oh yeah like if we had more seasons...

1269
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,780
I would wanna do this.

1270
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,580
I would like love to do that.

1271
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,280
And then they were planning on having a season 4.

1272
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,060
And then...

1273
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,200
DuckTales and then having...

1274
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,880
And then after season 4 is over.

1275
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,920
That's when they end it.

1276
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,460
And then they'll do Darkwing Duck.

1277
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,580
But they never did that.

1278
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,900
Because Disney was like...

1279
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,620
Not enough money.

1280
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,300
But the...

1281
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,300
But the main reason is that they don't make merch.

1282
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,100
That's what pisses me off the most.

1283
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,980
The only reason why Teen Titans Go has like 500,000 seasons.

1284
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:28,400
Is that they spam so much fucking merch for Teen Titans Go.

1285
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,420
None of these other Disney shows make merch.

1286
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,300
And like...

1287
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,420
And like...

1288
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,140
That's what pisses me off.

1289
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:39,880
Because they're like...

1290
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,440
We don't get enough support for...

1291
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,380
Oh yeah and Infinity Train.

1292
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,800
I fucking love Infinity Train.

1293
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,540
They're like...

1294
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,080
We don't...

1295
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,540
The shows you love.

1296
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,300
That you want us to make another season.

1297
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,660
We don't get enough...

1298
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,340
We don't get enough profit from that.

1299
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,640
Because nobody's buying anything.

1300
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,520
Buy what?

1301
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:57,780
Buy what?

1302
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,780
What do you want us to buy?

1303
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,960
The fucking one dollar comic book?

1304
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,060
Like...

1305
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,600
Where?

1306
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,960
I go to a toy store.

1307
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,300
It's Teen Titans Go.

1308
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,500
Where the fuck is the Owl House?

1309
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,840
Buy the thing you don't make.

1310
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,240
Exactly.

1311
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,220
There's like...

1312
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,120
There's like...

1313
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,980
It's always merch.

1314
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,340
But what merch?

1315
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,000
Like...

1316
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,260
What do we buy?

1317
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,280
There's so much...

1318
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,240
But then they're like...

1319
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,400
Oh...

1320
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,300
But then they're like...

1321
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:40,800
Oh...

1322
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,200
But...

1323
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,700
If we make the merch...

1324
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,380
No one's going to buy it.

1325
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,480
Because our data shows...

1326
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,140
That...

1327
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:47,700
Like...

1328
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,220
It's just a loss of profit.

1329
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,100
If we do make that merch.

1330
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,060
What data?

1331
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,500
What fucking data?

1332
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,680
If you don't make any...

1333
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,140
What data do you have?

1334
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,600
What do you make?

1335
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,900
Anyway...

1336
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,500
It's crazy.

1337
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,780
But they're willing to make the 500 fucking lightsaber for Star Wars.

1338
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,420
It's just...

1339
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:24,960
Oh man.

1340
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,620
That's why I'm so sad whenever shows get cancelled.

1341
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,060
Like get like not renewed or...

1342
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,840
Shows I enjoy.

1343
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,500
I really miss DuckTales.

1344
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,060
Woohoo.

1345
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,840
Ba da ba dum ba bum ba da DuckTales.

1346
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,660
Woohoo.

1347
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,580
Yeah.

1348
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,340
They made merch for Grav...

1349
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,160
Barely.

1350
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,220
Like it wasn't like...

1351
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,840
They barely did made merch for Gravity.

1352
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,140
Gravity Falls.

1353
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,260
Okay, Gravity...

1354
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:56,900
Falls.

1355
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,300
You see more shit for fucking Teen Titans go than you did Gravity Falls.

1356
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,660
To be fair, the show is over though.

1357
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,520
But like...

1358
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,880
I feel like there...

1359
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,680
It did not exist as much as like the other stuff going on there.

1360
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:17,080
Like especially like a lot of merch they made for Gravity Falls was not gear towards children.

1361
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,780
They were clearly gear towards like...

1362
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,780
Millennials.

1363
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,620
Like that's the issue.

1364
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:24,820
Like...

1365
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:30,620
They're like, if this merch does not sell for children, there's no point in selling anything.

1366
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:37,860
And because of that, there's no point in... there's... this show does not make any profit.

1367
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,000
That's their data!

1368
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:48,960
If the fucking shows... if the merch doesn't sell enough for children, they're like, it's not profitable.

1369
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,750
I still buy toys Disney, but yeah!

1370
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:16,190
When a company is run by like, 60 year old grandpas, who sometimes... who some of them still think animation is for children, they just be like, it's not profitable because kids don't want to buy it.

1371
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:23,190
Have you seen the kingdom hearts pilot episode for disney's channel?

1372
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:23,870
It's on YouTube.

1373
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,870
Moose, thank you for the super chat.

1374
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:25,190
Thank you!

1375
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:35,170
I don't remember... I think I had I think I have, but I'm pretty sure I don't remember much of it.

1376
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:41,830
But I've also saw the Sailor Moon American Sailor Moon cartoon.

1377
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:44,410
And that one was a little silly too.

1378
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:54,950
I think the American Sailor Moon cartoon was also a little silly.

1379
00:56:55,910 --> 00:57:01,510
So I'm glad that they just brought over the Japanese Sailor Moon.

1380
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,650
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

1381
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,450
Thank you.

1382
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,670
To be fair, we rather have three seasons than 13.

1383
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:10,410
They tend to become a shell of their former selves the longer they go on.

1384
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,490
Thank you for the super chat.

1385
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:11,810
Thank you.

1386
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:17,230
That is true, but if there's still more of the story to tell, I don't see why.

1387
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:20,430
If the writers have more of the stories they want to tell...

1388
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:24,930
I think it's different when the show itself is not a story.

1389
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,130
It's more of a serialized show.

1390
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:32,810
The reason why a lot of shows don't have any progression...

1391
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:33,510
That's different.

1392
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:36,690
A lot of the actual good animated shows...

1393
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,750
Will have a progression of storyline.

1394
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,970
And where characters age.

1395
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,250
Because a lot of them don't go...

1396
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,530
It's very uncommon for reruns to go.

1397
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:54,930
That's why a lot of shows tend to have characters that just do what they want.

1398
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,250
And they do not grow up for animation.

1399
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,790
Because they can put reruns of that forever.

1400
00:57:59,170 --> 00:57:59,970
And ever.

1401
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,690
So there's no progression.

1402
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:05,310
And...

1403
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:07,770
And...

1404
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:08,030
And...

1405
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:12,430
Because there's no progression, they can just put random episodes for a rerun.

1406
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,970
It's why The Simpsons and Family Guy...

1407
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:18,970
They're all fucking the same age forever.

1408
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,210
They never age up.

1409
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:23,310
So they can just put random Simpsons episodes.

1410
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:24,910
Or random Family Guy episodes.

1411
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:27,890
Because there's no character progression for anybody.

1412
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,130
Or character development for anybody.

1413
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,630
They're just the same person.

1414
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,290
But what if this happens?

1415
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,730
Or what if that happens?

1416
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:42,910
I'm so bitter about where they ended the original Teen Titans.

1417
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:44,050
They're never going to bring it back.

1418
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,610
Because to them it's not profitable.

1419
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,610
Because they're like...

1420
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,110
Who bought the merch?

1421
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:52,230
They never made merch until Teen Titans go.

1422
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:53,510
What the fuck do you mean?

1423
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:54,990
Like...

1424
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:06,250
They only started making actual shit for Teen Titans the moment Teen Titans go dropped.

1425
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:07,830
What do you mean?

1426
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:19,370
Anyway...

1427
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:21,590
Yeah, OG Teen Titans is amazing.

1428
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,650
But they're never going to bring it back.

1429
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:26,330
Because children like Teen Titans go more.

1430
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:27,250
Like...

1431
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,910
It's just more appealing to watch for little kids.

1432
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:30,650
Like...

1433
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,730
I talked about this before.

1434
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:32,730
I feel like...

1435
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,030
Sorry.

1436
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:35,850
Every time I talk about animation I go in a long-ass tangent.

1437
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:36,530
But like...

1438
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,190
This is one of my favorite memes about Teen Titans go.

1439
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:39,790
Like...

1440
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:40,190
Okay.

1441
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:40,910
Schedule.

1442
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,890
Let me see if I can find it.

1443
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:43,370
I'll show it.

1444
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,170
Oh my god.

1445
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:45,910
Okay.

1446
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,570
Alright.

1447
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,590
This is one of my favorite...

1448
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:53,630
This is one of my favorite memes about Teen Titans go.

1449
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,270
But this is...

1450
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:56,450
I showed this...

1451
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:57,590
I talked about this before.

1452
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:01,110
But this is how profitable Teen Titans go was.

1453
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:02,310
Like...

1454
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,010
This was...

1455
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,670
This was the Teen Titans go schedule.

1456
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:15,510
It's like...

1457
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:16,730
Teen Titans go.

1458
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:17,950
Teen Titans go.

1459
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,590
Teen Titans go.

1460
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,150
And then he gives a shout.

1461
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,450
Whoa!

1462
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,350
Teen Titans go island.

1463
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:23,810
Island adventure.

1464
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:24,750
Oh my...

1465
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,930
And then there are two episodes of Steven Universe.

1466
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:28,250
Good for them.

1467
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,710
Good for them for putting that two episodes in.

1468
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,130
Like...

1469
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:37,050
Oh my god.

1470
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:38,110
Wow.

1471
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:41,230
They gave Steven Universe a fucking bone.

1472
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,270
Put two episodes at 7.30pm.

1473
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:45,550
You know what?

1474
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,090
It's good that they try to diverse a little bit.

1475
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:48,610
You know?

1476
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,990
Peter, thank you for the video.

1477
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:55,510
Thank you for the super chat.

1478
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:55,970
Thank you.

1479
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:56,650
Thank you.

1480
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:58,410
Uh...

1481
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:00,230
Could be worse.

1482
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:04,170
Batman Beyond didn't get comics until a decade later.

1483
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:07,210
The live action movie was also canned in the 2000s.

1484
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:07,750
Thank you for the super chat.

1485
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:08,090
Thank you.

1486
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:12,310
They also can the animated movie that's gonna be in the same style as like...

1487
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,890
The Spider-Verse one too.

1488
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,270
Uh...

1489
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:17,390
Yeah.

1490
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:18,690
They were...

1491
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:20,610
They also cancelled that if you guys don't remember.

1492
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,810
Because it was...

1493
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:22,730
It was just...

1494
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,650
They just didn't think it would be profitable.

1495
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:25,630
Uh...

1496
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:28,290
Oh yeah.

1497
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:28,690
No name.

1498
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:29,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1499
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:29,970
Thank you.

1500
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,530
Thank you.

1501
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:34,110
Two episodes of Steven Universe before Steven Universe goes on hiatus again.

1502
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,370
Thoughts on Codename Kids Next Door?

1503
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,890
So sad that they never made that sequel.

1504
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:44,470
I remembered when the creator of Codename Kids Next Door made a whole fucking...

1505
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:46,570
What's that word called for like...

1506
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:48,470
Um...

1507
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:52,390
What's that word when they do like a whole like online puzzle game?

1508
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,190
What's that word called?

1509
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:55,890
There's a special word for it.

1510
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:57,110
Uh...

1511
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,470
What's it called when they...

1512
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:00,190
It's like it's online...

1513
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:01,490
ARG!

1514
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:01,770
Yeah.

1515
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:02,630
Uh...

1516
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:03,290
ARG.

1517
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:05,390
So like if you guys didn't know the creator...

1518
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,550
I was there for it.

1519
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,570
Because I was also like super into...

1520
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:11,250
I was and still am super into kids...

1521
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,390
I mean I don't know if still am is like the right word to say.

1522
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:15,550
But I still miss it.

1523
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:16,930
But um...

1524
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:21,910
The creator of Kids Next Door made a whole ARG for the Galactic Next Door.

1525
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:24,530
Which was considered a sequel to the Kids Next Door.

1526
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:29,230
And like a lot of like the original voice actors and the um...

1527
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,850
And like the crew were willing to come back to it.

1528
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,970
And he made a whole ARG to get like fan support.

1529
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,050
Uh...

1530
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:36,530
To...

1531
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:41,190
To get fan support to try and like persuade the executives at Cartoon Network.

1532
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,850
To like greenlit like a sequel.

1533
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,010
And like when you saw the ARG...

1534
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:47,510
It unlocks the...

1535
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,290
The...

1536
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,890
Like the pilot...

1537
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,890
I guess like the pilot episode or something.

1538
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:52,430
For...

1539
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,110
For the Galactic...

1540
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:56,110
Next Door.

1541
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,590
And it was so cool.

1542
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:59,810
Cause I was doing the ARG with everybody too.

1543
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:02,070
And I was like super hyped for it.

1544
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,750
But nothing happened!

1545
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,050
Nothing happened!

1546
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,690
Does Kids Next Door even have merch?

1547
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,470
Obviously it doesn't.

1548
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:09,890
Cause why don't we don't have a sequel.

1549
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,070
But at least it went more longer than three seasons.

1550
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,190
At least we got six seasons of that.

1551
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:17,370
But I would have loved to have a Galactic Kids Next Door.

1552
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,350
I felt like that was like a missed opportunity.

1553
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:20,710
Um...

1554
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,970
If they do it now...

1555
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,710
They're just gonna be like banking on nostalgia.

1556
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:26,090
And like it's not gonna be the same.

1557
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,270
It's just gonna be flash animated.

1558
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,310
And I don't want that.

1559
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:31,430
I feel like...

1560
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:32,590
I feel like...

1561
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:35,070
It's gonna feel like so different.

1562
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:36,830
Like I feel like it's gonna be...

1563
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:37,890
It's just gonna feel weird.

1564
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:39,130
Um...

1565
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:41,010
Like I...

1566
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:43,850
It's just gonna feel like super weird.

1567
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:44,970
I feel like...

1568
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,970
I feel like the budget wouldn't be the same.

1569
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,210
It's like when like...

1570
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:48,650
What is it?

1571
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:48,950
Okay.

1572
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,250
It's like...

1573
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,610
Like flash can be good.

1574
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,170
Flash animation can be good.

1575
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:56,390
But I feel like after a long time...

1576
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,250
Um...

1577
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,150
I mean like obviously...

1578
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:00,150
Wait, flash is dead.

1579
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:01,310
What's the newest one?

1580
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,150
Um...

1581
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,390
But like it can be good.

1582
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,090
Because like My Little Pony was done on...

1583
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:06,390
How was it?

1584
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:07,610
Was it done on flash?

1585
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:09,010
No, it...

1586
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:09,730
What was the...

1587
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:10,770
What was the...

1588
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:13,210
What was the program they used?

1589
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:14,810
But like if you guys didn't know...

1590
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:17,270
The Friendship is Messed Magic episodes...

1591
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,230
Oh my god.

1592
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,970
The budget for that shit was insane.

1593
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:25,730
Oh yeah, Toon Boon.

1594
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:26,570
Oh yeah, Toon Boon.

1595
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:27,470
Um...

1596
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:27,970
But okay.

1597
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:28,750
Ah...

1598
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,330
Budget per episode.

1599
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,770
It got really...

1600
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,490
I was like reading up the budget...

1601
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,070
Budget for each one.

1602
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:36,350
Six million!

1603
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:37,230
What?

1604
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:37,950
Okay.

1605
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:40,510
Okay.

1606
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:42,230
Um...

1607
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:43,550
What?

1608
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:44,110
Okay.

1609
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,430
It's like...

1610
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:46,390
Wow...

1611
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:46,970
Okay.

1612
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:47,930
How much is it?

1613
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:48,250
Uh...

1614
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:48,470
How much?

1615
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,310
How much is that budget?

1616
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,130
Budget for...

1617
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,090
What was that budget?

1618
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:54,450
Okay.

1619
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:56,350
It was like...

1620
01:04:56,350 --> 01:05:00,450
Two hundred to three hundred thousand dollars per episode...

1621
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:01,150
Um...

1622
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,950
So, each season would be like around six million, uh...

1623
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:06,430
Like it was...

1624
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:06,650
Yeah.

1625
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:10,450
It was like two hundred to three hundred thousand dollars per episode.

1626
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:10,990
But it...

1627
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,090
Like if you see how the production ran for that, you'd understand it.

1628
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,450
And then after...

1629
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,950
Yeah, it was per episode.

1630
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:21,910
Merch fucking sold a lot though at least.

1631
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:32,910
Anyway, I read that and then they tried to make a sequel for it but oh my god.

1632
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,830
The quality.

1633
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:48,870
The quality of that sequel was wow-wee.

1634
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:53,930
I was like looking at the animation quality.

1635
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:56,530
I was like wow-wee.

1636
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,030
That anime.

1637
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:03,490
That's definitely not $200-300,000 per episode anymore.

1638
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:04,970
Whoa.

1639
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:06,810
Anyway.

1640
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:07,490
Anyway, that's how I feel.

1641
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:17,150
I feel like if we do a sequel to Kids Next Door now, the quality for that is gonna deteriorate so...

1642
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:27,070
It's like those who were so hyped about Mega Man and people were so hyped because they were like, Mega Man's gonna get a sequel and a show?

1643
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:28,750
Oh, okay.

1644
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:29,130
Not Mega Man.

1645
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:29,570
Megamind!

1646
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:30,550
Sorry, Megamind.

1647
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:35,110
Megamind is gonna get a sequel movie and a show?

1648
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:36,810
And everyone was so hyped.

1649
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:40,590
And people found out Will Ferrell wasn't gonna reprise his role as Mega Man.

1650
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,970
And then that's when we all know things are not gonna be as good as it seems.

1651
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,530
And then the trailer dropped.

1652
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:50,850
And then that's when everybody really knew, oh, it's that type of sequel.

1653
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:04,030
And that's why I hope that Galactic Kids Next Door stays fucking dead.

1654
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:08,550
Because I feel like it's gonna be very similar.

1655
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,030
I could feel that...

1656
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,930
If you wait too long...

1657
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:21,970
If you wait too long...

1658
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,260
But not long enough...

1659
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:32,210
I feel like if you wait too long but not long enough, the sequel will be really bad.

1660
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,810
But if you wait...

1661
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:34,870
Really long!

1662
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:36,210
Really, really long!

1663
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,090
That like...

1664
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:40,510
It's like some fucking 90s, 80s shit that you're rebooting.

1665
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,710
Then it'll be okay.

1666
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:43,050
Because then like...

1667
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:45,430
Those people who reboot something...

1668
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,610
That long...

1669
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:52,450
They wanna make sure they take really good care of the image of that.

1670
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,850
Like the reimagining of it.

1671
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:54,950
But like...

1672
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:58,470
I heard the new X-Men animated show was like pretty decent too.

1673
01:07:59,030 --> 01:07:59,670
Um...

1674
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:02,350
Yeah, is it X-Men...

1675
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:05,130
There's a new X-Men show...

1676
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:07,130
That seems to...

1677
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:09,830
That's like really good animation-wise.

1678
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:10,970
And...

1679
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,450
I haven't watched it yet.

1680
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:15,850
But I heard the new X-Men animated show was like...

1681
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:16,990
Animation-wise...

1682
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:18,070
Was really good.

1683
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:20,050
I haven't watched it yet.

1684
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:21,350
I really love...

1685
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:23,330
I love the animated X-Men.

1686
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:24,230
Not the...

1687
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:26,550
Not the OG animated X-Men.

1688
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:27,670
The one where they were like...

1689
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,150
Fucking kid...

1690
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:29,350
Like...

1691
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:29,690
Not... Sorry.

1692
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:30,450
Where they were...

1693
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:32,010
Teenagers.

1694
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,130
Okay, they were always teenagers.

1695
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:35,190
But the one where they were like...

1696
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:35,830
It was like...

1697
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:37,050
High school drama.

1698
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:37,970
You know?

1699
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:43,670
Where...

1700
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:45,450
They were like...

1701
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:46,510
Which one was it?

1702
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:47,710
Which X-Men was that?

1703
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,170
The one where they was like...

1704
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:50,030
High school drama.

1705
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,110
Almost every episode.

1706
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:53,510
I was like...

1707
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:55,710
X-Men Evolution!

1708
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:56,490
Yes!

1709
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,550
Yes!

1710
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:58,970
I loved X-Men Evolution.

1711
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:00,070
That shit was...

1712
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,730
That shit...

1713
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:01,590
Slaps.

1714
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:02,670
Um...

1715
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:04,750
I love X-Men Evolution.

1716
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,310
But I think the funniest thing they did...

1717
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:08,410
With...

1718
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,290
Uh...

1719
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,090
The funniest thing about the...

1720
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,850
The new X-Men show...

1721
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,050
Is that they changed...

1722
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:16,170
Uh...

1723
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:19,490
Okay, what's his name?

1724
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:19,990
They...

1725
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:22,770
Uh...

1726
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:23,410
Fuck!

1727
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:24,250
What was his name?

1728
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:25,510
Um...

1729
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:28,130
Okay, X-Men 97 characters...

1730
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,450
They like changed people's powers.

1731
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:32,170
Because they're like...

1732
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,710
Oh, this is actually what it's like.

1733
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:34,610
And I thought it was...

1734
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:35,710
So funny.

1735
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,290
Uh...

1736
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:41,230
Cyclops!

1737
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:42,870
I don't know why I forgot Cyclops.

1738
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:43,090
I'm sorry.

1739
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:44,550
My brain isn't working.

1740
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:45,430
Um...

1741
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:45,950
So...

1742
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,250
Cyclops powers now.

1743
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,230
So like...

1744
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,270
If you guys didn't know...

1745
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,370
It was so funny.

1746
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,010
When I read the explanation...

1747
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:56,190
When I read the explanation for Cyclops powers now...

1748
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:57,010
So like...

1749
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:57,730
You know how like...

1750
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:58,110
We all know...

1751
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:58,970
It's laser eyes.

1752
01:09:59,190 --> 01:09:59,470
Right?

1753
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,470
So...

1754
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,150
Appar...

1755
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:02,510
Like the reason why...

1756
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:04,350
So...

1757
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:05,470
We all know...

1758
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,450
It's like laser eyes.

1759
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,830
Like the normies.

1760
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:08,410
I.e.

1761
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:08,650
Me.

1762
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,350
Or like laser eyes.

1763
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:10,670
Yeah.

1764
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:11,450
Laser beams.

1765
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:12,450
It shoots lasers.

1766
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:13,950
But now...

1767
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,530
Modern wise...

1768
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:16,530
It's kinetic blast.

1769
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,790
And now you guys are thinking...

1770
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:20,170
Oh, Doki.

1771
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:22,730
What do you mean by kinetic blast?

1772
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:27,170
Apparently his eyes are portals to the fucking punch universe?

1773
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:29,170
And the punch dimension?

1774
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:30,590
And I...

1775
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:39,970
And his eyes pull out these punch lasers from a different dimension.

1776
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,370
So when he opens his eyes...

1777
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,250
The lasers punches you.

1778
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:46,510
And I thought...

1779
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,050
I was like...

1780
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:53,430
And it's like a fist.

1781
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,290
So they're not actual like laser beams.

1782
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:56,990
Like you know...

1783
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,030
Superman lasers.

1784
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,870
It's like a punch laser.

1785
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:00,730
But like...

1786
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:03,030
The normies always thought they were you know...

1787
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:06,430
Superman lasers and it's through this ad...

1788
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:06,910
New ad...

1789
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:07,250
Cause they're...

1790
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,210
Someone posted a fucking clip.

1791
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:10,810
No.

1792
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:11,230
It's...

1793
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:11,830
I'm not...

1794
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:13,070
It's called the punch dimension.

1795
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:20,490
His eyes are portals to the punch dimension so that when he opens his eyes, he's punching people with his eye lasers.

1796
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:25,210
I thought that was the dumbest thing I've ever read but it was also pretty funny.

1797
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:25,810
Okay.

1798
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:33,330
Jonathan, thank you for the super chat.

1799
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:34,490
Thank you, thank you.

1800
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:37,450
Does Velma count as a reboot of a series of Scooby?

1801
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,710
We don't talk about Velma.

1802
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,430
Do not hate watch Velma!

1803
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:41,630
I know!

1804
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,550
No, Matt, please!

1805
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:44,070
I beg of you!

1806
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:45,890
Stop hate watching things!

1807
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:51,090
Because the moment you start hate watching things, you're gonna give it attention and a reboot.

1808
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,430
Or not reboot, a renewal of a series.

1809
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:54,730
Please don't.

1810
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:56,470
We don't need another season of Velma.

1811
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:58,850
Um, please stop hate watching.

1812
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:03,750
The only reason why Velma got another season is because we all hate watched it.

1813
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:09,310
You know what fucking sucked?

1814
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:17,270
The thing that sucked the most is that the animation quality for Velma is actually pretty good.

1815
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:19,510
That's the worst part.

1816
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:24,090
Like, I actually really like the animation budget for this.

1817
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:29,810
Because they actually go hard on, like, the animation budget for this.

1818
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:31,130
And I think that's the reason why I hate watching it.

1819
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,810
Because I also hate watched it.

1820
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,230
I was part of the problem.

1821
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:43,050
I hate, I hate, I was also part of the problem.

1822
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:51,470
But the fucking animation quality was so good!

1823
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,910
The writing was fucking terrible, of course.

1824
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:55,670
But, like, oh my god.

1825
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:56,990
The fucking...

1826
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:58,370
The...

1827
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,190
The...

1828
01:12:59,190 --> 01:12:59,990
Okay, by the way.

1829
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:01,730
Not only did I...

1830
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:02,030
...

1831
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:04,150
Guys!

1832
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:07,610
I need you all to stop hate watching Velma.

1833
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,910
Because I already hate watched season two.

1834
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:12,970
And I need you guys to stop because I already did my part.

1835
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:15,510
And I need you guys to be stronger than me.

1836
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:16,270
I need...

1837
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,470
I need you...

1838
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:20,510
I need you all to be stronger than me.

1839
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,450
...

1840
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:27,430
Look, it's not just me!

1841
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:29,170
That's why I watched it!

1842
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,530
I want you guys to be stronger!

1843
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:31,650
...

1844
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:35,650
Okay.

1845
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:37,390
No I'll tell you the story.

1846
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,730
I'll tell you the story of Velma.

1847
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,610
I'll tell you season two.

1848
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,630
Okay.

1849
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:45,770
Scrappy Doo comes back in season two.

1850
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:51,690
And I swear to god I need this guy to stop being in every animated show.

1851
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,990
Not Scrappy Doo.

1852
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,970
But the guy who fucking voices Scrappy Doo.

1853
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,170
So, who voices Scrappy Doo?

1854
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:58,710
Okay?

1855
01:13:58,710 --> 01:13:59,710
Okay, it is.

1856
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:03,770
I need to fucking... okay, I need to like look up his name because I never remember his name.

1857
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:07,010
But his fucking voice is so iconic.

1858
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:11,790
So the person is Jason Menzucas.

1859
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:14,270
And you guys are like, who's that?

1860
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:19,990
He has been in every fucking animated show lately because his voice is so recognizable.

1861
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:22,550
But he only voices as himself.

1862
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:24,730
That's the... he only plays himself.

1863
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:28,450
I swear to God, every... he has been typecasted as himself.

1864
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:31,550
Every time.

1865
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:34,350
It's some... okay, not himself, but like some fucking crazy dude.

1866
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:36,430
It's always some fucking crazy dude.

1867
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:39,970
He's in everything now.

1868
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:40,830
And I'm tired.

1869
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:45,830
Like he has a great voice, but I'm fucking tired of hearing him right now.

1870
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:53,610
I'm fucking tired of hearing him in every animated show I'm watching.

1871
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:57,010
It's just because he just plays the same guy.

1872
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,910
Anyway, he's Scrappy-Doo, by the way.

1873
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:06,210
He's uh... uh... he's... he plays as Scrappy-Doo.

1874
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:08,590
And let me tell you the whole story.

1875
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:11,350
Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna tell you season two of Velma.

1876
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:14,010
Because like I don't want you guys to watch Velma.

1877
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:16,870
Like I... I did it for you, chat.

1878
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:18,290
I fucking...

1879
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:21,490
I hate watch Velma.

1880
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:23,590
So you don't have to hate watch Velma.

1881
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:26,370
So we won't give Velma season three.

1882
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:31,170
So...

1883
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:34,010
So the thing is...

1884
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:35,530
Okay, the thing is...

1885
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:37,670
So Shaggy... who is it?

1886
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:38,510
Norville?

1887
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:41,270
Okay, by the way, Shaggy isn't called Shaggy anymore.

1888
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,490
He's called Norville.

1889
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:46,090
But the... and so like Norville starts...

1890
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:49,030
Like in season one, he doesn't eat anything.

1891
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,550
It's... it's not Shaggy.

1892
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,430
Like in season one...

1893
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:55,810
Like he doesn't eat anything.

1894
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,510
He doesn't like snack at all.

1895
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:00,690
He like... he still wears his like green shirt or whatever.

1896
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,850
But he doesn't have a dog or anything.

1897
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:04,210
And he doesn't, you know...

1898
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:04,910
He...

1899
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:07,750
We all know Shaggy was, you know...

1900
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:10,890
Like... like woo Molly, you know?

1901
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:11,610
Okay, so...

1902
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,450
Norville does not do any of that.

1903
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:20,350
And in season two, he starts having like hallucinations.

1904
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:22,930
And like he starts having hallucinations.

1905
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,910
And like starts getting triggered by...

1906
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:28,810
By like...

1907
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:31,370
Because he killed Fred's mom.

1908
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,490
So he keeps having hallucinations.

1909
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,290
And like triggered hallucinations.

1910
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,550
And like trauma and stuff.

1911
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:40,210
And the only way to stop his hallucination is to eat.

1912
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:42,750
So then throughout the season, he...

1913
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,730
He snacks and eats a lot.

1914
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:47,590
Because he wants to stop the hallucinations.

1915
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:48,470
Hahahaha!

1916
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:50,690
Hahahaha!

1917
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:53,170
Mochi, thank you for the 10 gifted chips.

1918
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:54,610
Thank you, thank you.

1919
01:16:56,510 --> 01:17:00,590
He's like, the only way to stop my hallucination is if I snack on something.

1920
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:02,470
Quick Velma, give me a snack!

1921
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:03,370
Like...

1922
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:07,890
And then...

1923
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:10,090
And...

1924
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:11,770
Yeah, he kills Fred's...

1925
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:12,670
Yeah, he kills Fred's mom.

1926
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:13,970
So he has like hallucinations.

1927
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:15,870
But don't worry, Fred's mom was a bad person.

1928
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:18,270
Anyway, the Hex sisters are back.

1929
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:19,470
But they're old.

1930
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:23,710
The Hex sisters has a cameo.

1931
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,250
By being like...

1932
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,070
By being like...

1933
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:28,510
Like...

1934
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,910
Like roommates with Daphne's parents.

1935
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:32,810
And...

1936
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:34,530
And...

1937
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:35,770
So like one of the...

1938
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:37,070
It's like one of the Hex sisters.

1939
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:39,650
And then like she has a child.

1940
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:40,390
She's like old.

1941
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:41,830
The Hex sister is old now.

1942
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,990
It's one Hex sister, by the way.

1943
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:45,430
It's one Hex sister.

1944
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:46,810
And she's our mom now.

1945
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:49,990
And she has a child who's a teenager.

1946
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:53,810
Who are staying over at Daphne's place.

1947
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:55,910
Because they're broke or something.

1948
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,270
Because they're open a witch store.

1949
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,250
Anyway, none of that is important.

1950
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:03,330
The whole plot is some fucking brain switching plot.

1951
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:07,570
Because Norville's fucking grandmother is a scientist.

1952
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:10,710
Who was working on a thing called Project Scooby.

1953
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:13,090
And you're like, what's Project Scooby?

1954
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:17,810
Well, Project Scooby is like the brain swapping operation thing.

1955
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:19,490
So he like...

1956
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:22,310
Norville found out that his grandmother never died.

1957
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:24,910
And she was actually hiding out in the facility.

1958
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:30,610
Where she helps soldiers and helps people find their true self.

1959
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:33,250
By swapping their brains into a jar.

1960
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:34,970
So they can find themselves.

1961
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,550
And like when they are in a jar.

1962
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:39,370
When they're a brain in a jar.

1963
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:42,210
They realize what they want to be in the future.

1964
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:45,010
Because they're like, you know, they're just a brain in a jar.

1965
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:47,790
So they can like figure out what's their purpose.

1966
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:50,970
And after they figure out their purpose in life.

1967
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:54,030
She swaps the brain back into that first body.

1968
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:56,710
So that's what Project Scooby is.

1969
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,450
But then there is a hidden person called Uncle Scooby.

1970
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:05,930
And people are trying to figure out who is the secret identity of Uncle Scooby.

1971
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:10,950
And the thing about that is that they created Uncle Scooby.

1972
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:15,530
And the military created a project.

1973
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:17,790
Using the research from...

1974
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:20,370
From Norval's grandmother.

1975
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,030
To make Scrappy Doo.

1976
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:25,330
And Scrappy Doo is like a fucking murderer.

1977
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:27,190
Like because...

1978
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:29,290
The story starts off...

1979
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:33,050
Let me just say.

1980
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:36,190
The story starts off in season 2.

1981
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,890
Where there has been murders.

1982
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:41,590
And then they were wondering who committed these murders.

1983
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:46,070
And so they were trying to figure out who the fuck committed all these murders.

1984
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:47,670
And then later on.

1985
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:50,930
They found out that these people died.

1986
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,270
By having their dicks bit off.

1987
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:53,910
So...

1988
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,100
So...

1989
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,280
So...

1990
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,160
So...

1991
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:05,120
So people were like...

1992
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,140
Oh my god!

1993
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:11,720
All these middle aged men are getting their dicks bit off!

1994
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,620
What's going on?

1995
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:13,980
And they were like...

1996
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:20,480
And we discovered it was Scrappy Doo this entire time.

1997
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,240
Uh...

1998
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:26,740
So...

1999
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:28,920
Um...

2000
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,320
Um...

2001
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:30,760
Um...

2002
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:31,320
Um...

2003
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:31,860
First...

2004
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,740
First one.

2005
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:33,700
Thank you for the super chat.

2006
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,080
Thank you.

2007
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:34,440
Thank you.

2008
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,660
I'll do anything for you to stop anything.

2009
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,360
You know what to do.

2010
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:40,440
So...

2011
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:41,980
Anyway...

2012
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:42,940
Um...

2013
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:43,600
So...

2014
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,460
Anyway...

2015
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:53,540
The ending of the story is that everyone tries to stop Scrappy Doo from fucking biting their dicks.

2016
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,140
Pay for my silence.

2017
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:03,920
So...

2018
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,800
People are trying to fucking...

2019
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,620
Um...

2020
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:12,140
People are trying to figure out like how to stop Scrappy Doo from killing everybody.

2021
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:13,700
And it ends...

2022
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,280
I'll just skip to the ending chat.

2023
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:19,920
And it basically ends where Scrappy...

2024
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,400
Um...

2025
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,620
Where Velma sacrifices her life...

2026
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:25,440
Uh...

2027
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,000
To...

2028
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,020
To help stop Scrappy Doo from killing everybody.

2029
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,440
And then...

2030
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,480
She possesses...

2031
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,400
And then Scrappy Doo...

2032
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,100
And then like a fucking missile.

2033
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,000
Oh yeah!

2034
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,080
The military sends a missile at the school.

2035
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:39,900
Uh...

2036
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,640
And...

2037
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:40,760
And then...

2038
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:42,880
And it hits Scrappy Doo.

2039
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:43,700
Uh...

2040
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,060
But Scrappy Doo survives.

2041
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,360
But...

2042
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:49,940
Uh...

2043
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:51,140
Velma doesn't survive.

2044
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:55,580
And then Scrappy Doo was like getting ready to kill the rest of the...

2045
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:57,020
The rest of the gang.

2046
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,340
And then he got possessed and died of a heart attack.

2047
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,080
I don't fucking know how he actually died.

2048
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,820
It just showed him getting possessed.

2049
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,400
And then we found out...

2050
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,420
Velma becomes a ghost...

2051
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,380
And ghosts are real!

2052
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:19,150
People are like, oh my god, wait, ghosts are real?

2053
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:36,010
And then, um... and then, this season ends with the fact that, uh, the season ends with them being like, what do we do?

2054
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:38,490
And Velma was like, do I go to the light?

2055
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:42,210
Or do I stay here and try to figure things out?

2056
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:51,890
And then the Hex sister, like, daughter was like, don't worry, Velma, I know a way to get your body back.

2057
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:56,490
And, but I will need to study for, we gotta wait until the summer.

2058
01:22:56,690 --> 01:23:01,950
I need to study all these witch books to figure out how to get your body back, Velma.

2059
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,590
And then the show ends.

2060
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,990
And that was the end of the season.

2061
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,550
The end of season two.

2062
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:18,850
Look, I actually, like, took out all the fucking filler in between, so you're welcome, guys.

2063
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:29,810
Cause there was, there was a lot of things going on in between every, cause like, there was one where, um, Velma's mom gets together with Fred's dad.

2064
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:35,950
And, um, and then Velma's, Velma's dad's, um...

2065
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:37,250
new wife.

2066
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:44,610
Like, Velma's stepmom, uh, got together, like, Velma's stepmom was actually Uncle Scooby this entire time.

2067
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:49,450
Um, who was working behind the scenes undercover as a waitress.

2068
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:59,110
Um, and like, purposely tried to, like, uh, get close to Velma's dad so that she could get more information regarding, like...

2069
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,870
Regarding Project Scooby.

2070
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:03,710
Like...

2071
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:07,190
Um...

2072
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:09,070
Anyway, Mercy, thank you for the Akasupa!

2073
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:10,590
Thank you, thank you!

2074
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:12,390
Can we never speak of Velma again?

2075
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:13,550
Thank you for the Akasupa!

2076
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,550
Thank you, thank you!

2077
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:16,330
And then, thank you for the Super Chat!

2078
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:17,310
Thank you, thank you!

2079
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:18,530
My brain hurts.

2080
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:19,410
Anyway!

2081
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:23,810
Now you guys don't have to watch Velma season two.

2082
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:27,370
Cause all you need to know is that Scrappy-Doo is in it.

2083
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:28,010
And he was biting.

2084
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:29,710
And people were like, who...

2085
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:32,310
The first episode is like, who are the murderers?

2086
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:33,290
It was Scrappy-Doo.

2087
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:35,990
He was the one that bit him.

2088
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,990
He bit everybody's dick off.

2089
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:43,230
Anyway!

2090
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:45,210
Also!

2091
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:46,350
Also!

2092
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:47,910
By the way...

2093
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:52,270
Oh yeah, Velma and Daphne are dating too.

2094
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:53,650
I don't know if that's relevant.

2095
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:55,770
And Norville's dating a fucking brain.

2096
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:56,990
And then...

2097
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:59,750
Fred is just very stupid.

2098
01:25:00,110 --> 01:25:00,310
Like...

2099
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:03,910
He has like, mommy and daddy issues.

2100
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:11,030
And then he's like, I'm just a baby.

2101
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:13,410
Um, wait, thank you for the Akasupa.

2102
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:14,590
Thank you, thank you.

2103
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:16,410
This is my second time listening to your stream.

2104
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:19,410
How this evolved into Velma season two.

2105
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:19,950
I don't know.

2106
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,130
All I know is that I am playing a train simulator.

2107
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:25,890
Chuckling my ass off about how badly written Velma is.

2108
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:29,030
I think I'll stay with Ghost in a Shell standalone complex.

2109
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:30,810
Thank you for the Akasupa.

2110
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:31,490
Thank you.

2111
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:32,150
Thank you.

2112
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:35,270
Um...

2113
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:36,710
Anyway.

2114
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:39,590
Anyway, that was Velma Season 2.

2115
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:44,230
And after all of that, I will have this...

2116
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:46,750
Okay, to be fair, I have a confession.

2117
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:52,430
I watched Episode 1 to 5 of Season 2 and then skipped to the last episode.

2118
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:54,710
Because I was like...

2119
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:58,090
Because there was no progression, I swear.

2120
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:05,510
The progression of the story, the progression of Season 2 was like 99% filler.

2121
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:08,190
And then 1% of the actual plot.

2122
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,650
So I was like, who the fuck is the murderer?

2123
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:15,190
I was so... I swear to God, I couldn't...

2124
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:17,970
Like, I was just like, who the fuck is the murderer?

2125
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:19,470
I was just... where?

2126
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:19,970
Where?

2127
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:23,470
Every time it's just a filler episode.

2128
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:29,190
I swear, it was like we make 1% progress of the fucking show plot.

2129
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:32,810
And then everything else was like, Fred has mommy issues.

2130
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:34,850
How is he gonna solve that?

2131
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:36,590
And like, um...

2132
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:39,490
And Norville suddenly has no empathy.

2133
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:43,490
But don't worry, he's just gonna get it back in like the next episode or something.

2134
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:45,350
I was like, where's the progression?

2135
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:46,590
And I was like...

2136
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:52,710
I just wanna know who the fuck is the murderer that's biting off people's dicks?

2137
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:54,150
Who is it?

2138
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:55,470
Like...

2139
01:26:57,250 --> 01:27:00,370
It's like, at first you're like, oh, somebody's chopping off their dicks.

2140
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:03,950
And I was like, oh my God, who the fuck is killing people by chopping off their dicks?

2141
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:04,830
And then they're like...

2142
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:07,230
Oh, my God, we find out it's Scrappy-Doo fucking eating it.

2143
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:08,390
And I'm like, what the fuck?

2144
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:10,970
And I got shown that in the last episode.

2145
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:17,030
Like, I didn't find that out until the last episode where I just skipped to the final episode to figure out what the fuck is going on.

2146
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:17,790
Like...

2147
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:23,750
I need to take a break, Dookie.

2148
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,910
I'm sorry, this is too much.

2149
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:29,350
Anyway...

2150
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:31,630
Despite all of that...

2151
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:34,590
I hate how good the animation is.

2152
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:41,550
Like, the quality of the visuals for Velma is too good for what the show is about.

2153
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:42,970
And it hurts.

2154
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:45,550
It actually is not fair.

2155
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:48,350
It's not fair at all.

2156
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:52,550
Why is the quality so good?

2157
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:00,490
There was like moments in there where I was like, wow.

2158
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:05,550
The animation and the face animation and the visuals.

2159
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:06,970
And the...

2160
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:13,450
There were moments where they do like insane shading and like expressions and everything.

2161
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:15,770
And I'm like, why does this look so good?

2162
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:21,330
Why does this look so fucking good for the show I'm watching?

2163
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:27,610
Anyway...

2164
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:29,350
I hate watch that show.

2165
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,470
So you don't have to watch it.

2166
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:31,850
Please do not give...

2167
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:35,650
Please do not give Velma another hate watch.

2168
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:36,510
I beg of you.

2169
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:41,050
It does not deserve a season 3.

2170
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:43,050
I swear to God.

2171
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:45,710
I know you guys are like now super curious.

2172
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:47,230
But I swear to God.

2173
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:48,170
It was...

2174
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:51,150
It sounds better than what it actually is.

2175
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,450
Like Scooby's not even in it, guys.

2176
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:59,410
Scooby Doo isn't even in it, chat.

2177
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:00,470
Like Scooby Doo isn't even in it, chat.

2178
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:02,210
Alright, anyway.

2179
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:05,350
Anyway.

2180
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:06,430
There was...

2181
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:07,130
That was...

2182
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:10,490
I can't believe I said majority of this chatting stream today.

2183
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:12,650
Just talking about animation.

2184
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:16,130
I was just incredibly passionate, chat.

2185
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:17,910
I was so fucking passionate.

2186
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:19,990
I was so fucking passionate.

2187
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:21,430
Jumping on to another topic.

2188
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:22,950
What the fuck is Tarkov doing?

2189
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:28,050
Did you guys hear about it?

2190
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:29,210
I didn't like...

2191
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:30,670
I never like joined...

2192
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:32,650
I never played Tarkov.

2193
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:36,190
But like...

2194
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:38,810
For those who don't know...

2195
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:40,450
For those who don't know...

2196
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:42,810
Tarkov like basically like a little...

2197
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:43,890
I guess like...

2198
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:46,610
Speed run of what's going on right now.

2199
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:50,850
Tarkov basically tried to release a game that was like 200 plus dollars.

2200
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:51,530
Tarkov basically tried to release a game that was like 200 plus dollars.

2201
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:53,270
And people were like what the fuck.

2202
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:54,610
It's like this pay to win...

2203
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:56,190
Oh yeah, and it's like pay to win DLC.

2204
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:57,150
And basically...

2205
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:00,390
Sort of killed Tarkov at the moment.

2206
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:02,090
But like not fully.

2207
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,230
Because I was talking to one of my friends.

2208
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:05,770
And I was...

2209
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:07,270
Because like they love Tarkov.

2210
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:08,870
And I was like yo...

2211
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,870
And they were like I don't know what to play.

2212
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,730
And then I was like what do you want to play?

2213
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:15,170
And they were like I'm going to play Tarkov.

2214
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:16,150
And I was like what the fuck?

2215
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:20,490
They were like...

2216
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:23,390
What do you mean?

2217
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:25,150
Why are you playing Tarkov?

2218
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:27,330
Didn't like shit happen?

2219
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:29,170
Why are you playing Tarkov?

2220
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:31,690
And then my friend was like...

2221
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:33,610
My friend...

2222
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:35,150
He was like...

2223
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:36,550
Oh it was on sale.

2224
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:38,290
Because of all that drama.

2225
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:45,530
It was like...

2226
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:46,790
It was like oh yeah.

2227
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:49,010
You know like after everything they put it on sale.

2228
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:50,950
And I was like I couldn't miss the opportunity.

2229
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:52,150
Like...

2230
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,630
Yeah.

2231
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:57,930
Yeah.

2232
01:30:58,110 --> 01:31:00,770
I think it was like $50 or something.

2233
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:01,510
He was like...

2234
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:02,010
Oh yeah.

2235
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:04,350
I don't know when it's going to be like $50 again.

2236
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:07,210
I might as well like buy the dip.

2237
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,870
Yeah.

2238
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:14,670
Because of everything that's going on at the moment.

2239
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:18,530
Tarkov decided to do like a huge fucking sale.

2240
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:23,330
To like convince people that they're like thinking about the consumers now.

2241
01:31:23,470 --> 01:31:25,610
And they're like sorry for the misuse of the internet.

2242
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:25,910
And they're like...

2243
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:26,370
I don't know what mistake we made.

2244
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,510
But we're gonna...

2245
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:30,530
Gaming marketing is so...

2246
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:31,410
It is.

2247
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:32,250
It is.

2248
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:33,870
I talked about this before.

2249
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:37,150
Because it doesn't matter how much like Nintendo does.

2250
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:40,370
The moment they release a new Legend of Zelda.

2251
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:42,290
You guys will just eat that shit up.

2252
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:43,890
It doesn't matter what they do.

2253
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:44,890
Like...

2254
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:49,370
The gaming audience is so easy to manipulate.

2255
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:50,090
Like...

2256
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:54,810
Like did you guys heard?

2257
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:57,250
About...

2258
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:58,690
About like...

2259
01:31:58,690 --> 01:32:00,650
The Garry's Mod shit.

2260
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:02,310
Like did you guys...

2261
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:02,990
You sell that?

2262
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:03,270
Where?

2263
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:05,250
Where like...

2264
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,730
It's like okay the new...

2265
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:09,050
The Garry's Mod thing where...

2266
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:11,730
We don't know if it's actually Nintendo.

2267
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:13,710
Like people don't know for sure yet.

2268
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:16,190
But basically the whole gist is that...

2269
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:19,870
Nintendo filed like copyright takedowns on...

2270
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:21,930
On...

2271
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:23,070
On Garry's Mod.

2272
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:24,170
And...

2273
01:32:25,610 --> 01:32:27,550
Garry's Mod now has to take down like...

2274
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:30,770
20 years worth of Nintendo IP stuff.

2275
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:32,410
In Garry's Mod.

2276
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:33,370
And that's 20 years.

2277
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:34,850
It was so sad.

2278
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:37,670
That the devs of Garry's Mod...

2279
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:38,510
Was like...

2280
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:42,570
Please it would help so much if you guys could take it down yourself.

2281
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:46,390
Because there's 20 years of...

2282
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:47,270
Because there's 20 years of...

2283
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:47,590
Because there's 20 years of...

2284
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:49,030
There's 20 years of content.

2285
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:51,430
And it's so much to do.

2286
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:56,220
And...

2287
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:56,900
And...

2288
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:59,120
People were like please.

2289
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:01,180
And just don't re-upload it.

2290
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,140
And like the fucking devs...

2291
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:04,700
Was like please.

2292
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:06,860
Take it down for us.

2293
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:09,840
And...

2294
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:11,840
But like...

2295
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,160
It's not the first time.

2296
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,300
And it's not going to be the last.

2297
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:18,640
And like the moment they release something...

2298
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,480
Oh my gosh.

2299
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,040
And then Nintendo's gonna be like...

2300
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,540
Guys we're gonna make a Legend of Zelda movie.

2301
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:24,820
And you guys would just forget.

2302
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:30,940
And then...

2303
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,760
You guys would be like next Nintendo Direct.

2304
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,500
Oh my god.

2305
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:36,620
Nintendo Direct.

2306
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:42,420
Yes.

2307
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:46,140
Gamers are just so easy to...

2308
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:46,900
Fucking...

2309
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,340
Like we're very simple minded.

2310
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,940
I'm simple minded.

2311
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,140
I would know.

2312
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:57,740
Um...

2313
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:58,720
That's...

2314
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,740
I can still...

2315
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:01,460
I can still...

2316
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,120
It's just...

2317
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,080
That's what I'm saying.

2318
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:08,440
There's just so simple minded.

2319
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,440
That would be like...

2320
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,020
Oh my god.

2321
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:12,760
Fucking 80% off of Tarkov.

2322
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,520
Might as well.

2323
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,060
Like...

2324
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:16,460
We don't know when that's gonna happen again.

2325
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:17,580
It just sucks.

2326
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:19,640
Cause like Tarkov is like one of the only...

2327
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:22,320
It's only if somebody makes a better...

2328
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,620
Better Tarkov-esque game.

2329
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:25,280
Cause like...

2330
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,700
Every time somebody tries to do like a...

2331
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:28,540
Um...

2332
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:30,380
A version of Tarkov, it dies.

2333
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:31,260
Like...

2334
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:31,980
Who is that one?

2335
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,980
The one with the space one.

2336
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:34,960
The Psycho?

2337
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,940
The Psycho died so fast.

2338
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:37,880
Oh my god.

2339
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,800
I can't believe I spent money on that game.

2340
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,060
I'm so sad.

2341
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,100
Yeah.

2342
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,560
80% off $250.

2343
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,340
What a fucking steal.

2344
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:52,640
Yeah.

2345
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,280
Psycho.

2346
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,340
Frontiers.

2347
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:55,060
Darkblade.

2348
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:56,100
Thank you for the super chat.

2349
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:56,480
Thank you.

2350
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,360
Spyro's don't forget.

2351
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,480
Yes, but they're still playing Smash though.

2352
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:03,460
Do you really never forget?

2353
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,900
If you're still trying to like play Smash Brothers.

2354
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,180
And also trying to...

2355
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:09,520
Trying to set up tournaments despite like...

2356
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:12,900
Despite like everything Nintendo tries to do against it.

2357
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:13,520
Like...

2358
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:14,780
Like...

2359
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,360
If you never forget, you just leave.

2360
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:19,460
But...

2361
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:21,120
Smash Brothers don't leave.

2362
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:22,020
They stay.

2363
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,920
It's just torture at that point.

2364
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:24,840
Like...

2365
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,580
Yeah!

2366
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:30,380
Um...

2367
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:30,960
Cass!

2368
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:31,940
Thank you for the super chat.

2369
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,260
Thank you.

2370
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:32,880
Thank you.

2371
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:35,380
Like I still buy Pokemon plushies.

2372
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,540
I still love Pokemon.

2373
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,220
I'm still gonna...

2374
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,000
Like I know my place.

2375
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,200
Stop it hurts.

2376
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:46,200
They're in their own little purgatory.

2377
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,980
We're all part of the problem.

2378
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:49,340
What?

2379
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:50,280
Darkblade!

2380
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:52,940
What other games can we play?

2381
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,040
Oh my god!

2382
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,200
That's so...

2383
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:57,100
That's so sad.

2384
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,880
What other games do we play?

2385
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,280
Don't talk to me.

2386
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,480
What else is there?

2387
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,360
That's what I'm saying.

2388
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,360
It doesn't matter.

2389
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:14,420
We...

2390
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:17,080
There's nothing we can do.

2391
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,000
Actually sad.

2392
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,660
Oh my god.

2393
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,060
Oh!

2394
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,500
That was...

2395
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,980
I think I'm gonna call it here guys.

2396
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:33,660
I think I'm gonna call it here chat.

2397
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:34,940

2398
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:38,140

2399
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:38,780

2413
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,680

01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,020

2420
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:24,000
Doki Amber Doge was so cute today guys!

2421
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,020

01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:27,500

Every time like I let him up on my bed.

2427
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,180

01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:52,900
Oh yes!

2437
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:53,620

2438
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,160
If you guys didn't know!

2439
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:57,920
If you guys didn't know...

2440
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,200
I'm going to be...

2441
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,460
At Anime North!

2442
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:04,880
It's actually my very very first Canadian convention!

2443
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:05,800
It's actually my very very first Canadian convention!

2444
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,200
Like I've never... It's actually crazy.

2445
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:10,080
As a Canadian... Canadian bird...

2446
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,340
I've never been to a...

2447
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:14,880
I've never guested at a Canadian convention before.

2448
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:15,220
I've never been to a...

2449
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:15,220
I've never guested at a Canadian convention before.

2450
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:17,740
I was really excited to...

2451
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:18,760
Have this opportunity.

2452
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:21,280
I'll only be there for a panel for one day.

2453
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,820
It's going to be like 8.30pm EST.

2454
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,140
Eastern because Anime North is on East Coast.

2455
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:27,800
But...

2456
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,760
I'm going to be doing a...

2457
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,420
Q&A panel for an hour.

2458
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,500
On Friday I believe.

2459
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,900
So it is in Canada!

2460
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:37,260
It's in Canada!

2461
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,660
And it's going to be the first convention for my Doki World Tour.

2462
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,300
So there's going to be many more conventions...

2463
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:43,720
In the future.

2464
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:44,940
And...

2465
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:46,840
So please look forward to it!

2466
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:48,680
So there's no meet and greet for this one.

2467
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:51,640
But that doesn't mean there wouldn't be meet and greets...

2468
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:52,940
In the future for the other conventions.

2469
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:55,740
A huge shout out for Anime North because they actually...

2470
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:56,840
Fit me in last minute.

2471
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,900
Because I saw their request a little bit...

2472
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,700
Late and they fit me in...

2473
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:05,760
Last minute so they weren't able to...

2474
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,580
Set up like meet and greets and stuff due to how...

2475
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:08,360
Last minute it was.

2476
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:09,800
So yes!

2477
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,520
I think I asked if I could...

2478
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,760
Like they like requested for me...

2479
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,220
Like...

2480
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:17,640
They like requested for me a while back...

2481
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,380
And then I saw the email...

2482
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:19,880
For it.

2483
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:21,480
Like me and my team saw...

2484
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,500
The email for it last month because it got lost.

2485
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:25,720
So I was like oh I really want to start...

2486
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,560
I really want to do a convention in May.

2487
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:29,080
And then we like...

2488
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,840
And we were able to get in last minute...

2489
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:32,780
For a...

2490
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,300
For a panel with them.

2491
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,540
So I'm super excited.

2492
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:37,600
Anyway!

2493
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,520
I'll see you guys...

2494
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:39,900
There!

2495
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,040
At Anime North!

2496
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,960
Anyway guys as always everybody...

2497
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,780
Stay hydrated, pause, check, get up...

2498
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,080
And move around to get that blood flowing.

2499
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,220
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2500
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,600
Because you deserve it.

2501
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:51,700
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2502
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,200
Bye guys!

2503
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:54,320
Bye!

2504
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,040
Also I know I said like next week...

2505
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,260
There was going to be two collabs.

2506
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:01,500
It's going to be one collab because the other one...

2507
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,900
Got rescheduled.

2508
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,540
It was supposed to be a singing lessons...

2509
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:07,880
With Yusan next week.

2510
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,880
But then we had like conflict of schedule.

2511
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,140
Between the two of us.

2512
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:14,860
So we decided to reschedule that to...

2513
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:16,720
Two weeks later.

2514
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,220
I don't remember the exact date.

2515
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,620
But like that's why it's going to be one collab.

2516
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,020
Next week instead.

2517
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,120
So next I have two.

2518
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,200
So just look forward to that other collab.

2519
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:27,140
Soon-ish.

2520
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,920
I think it's going to be like in two weeks or something.

2521
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:29,640
Anyway!

2522
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:30,600
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2523
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,460

2524
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:32,340
