1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
I went live, live.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,440
Alright, now you can swap.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,260
Yay!

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,220
We're going straight in.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,040
I had no intro, I just went straight in.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,040
You just opened up all the games.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,220
Yep, that's it.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,200
That's usually what happens in Collab.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,580
I just go straight in at that point.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,180
I've stopped putting an intro.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:37,680
It reminds me of when I was a Camelist streamer and I would literally hit the go live button on the game title screen and there was no fanfare whatsoever.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,900
Yeah, we're just here.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,640
It's time to give.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,480
Yeah, the reason why Snuffy sounds like she's dead inside is that we literally woke her up from a Discord call.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,580
Don't need to be rude, chat.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,200
Some people think it's attractive.

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,740
The reason Snuffy has sexy morning voice is because...

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,360
Oh, and those some people is Lime.

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,160
Oh yeah, Snuffy, I need you to appear online for like one second.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
Oh yeah, yeah, okay.

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,040
So I can get you in the lobby.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,140
After months of staying offline, I risk it all for this.

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,800
Just for Devour.

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,080
Don't know you're alive now.

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,780
You're now back on the grid.

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,720
It happens to me too.

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,700
I just hide offline forever and then people are like, no, you have to be online.

28
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,720
It's like, but...

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,680
You have to be online.

30
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,640
That's why I'm hosting, so I don't have to be online.

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,480
But then no one will know when I'm playing my porn games if I'm not online.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
You don't even have massage.

33
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,540
What is it?

34
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,040
Orc massage.

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,460
That's not the only game.

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,180
But it's the game.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,880
That's your game.

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,060
That's not my game, it's the people's game.

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,640
It's okay, Snuffy, neither have I.

40
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,580
We just spent the last ten minutes finding stupid things to put on our characters.

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,620
We literally spent money.

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,760
What?

44
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,300
I didn't even see that.

45
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,360
I got scammed because I'm...

46
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,840
Welcome to the default redhead.

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,840
What?

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,160
You guys look like my cool dads.

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,420
And I look like I'm a Greek.

50
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,660
And you look like my pet rat.

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,960
Do you like my pet rat over here?

52
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,240
Our pet rats.

53
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,480
Our gay dads and our twin daughters.

54
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,200
The gay dads and our twin daughters.

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,900
The gay dads and then we got the hipster daughter over here.

56
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,500
And then the one that turned to religion apparently.

57
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,700
Fives, you look like you should be in an Irish pub.

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,340
You look like a Canadian, eh?

59
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,380
Yeah, and then we all moved to Canada.

60
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,620
Wait, you got a rat?

61
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,780
Yeah!

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,140
Yeah, she had a rat too.

63
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,780
She looks after her cooler father.

64
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,120
Okay, you can not look at me and say that I'm not the cooler father.

65
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,220
Look at me!

66
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,380
Yes, you can!

67
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,080
I'm literally a fucking ex-Hollywood star!

68
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,880
What do you mean an ex-Hollywood star?

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,560
It says, Sam, washed up Hollywood star.

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,380
Loves John Wayne movies and Satan.

71
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,760
Hates most people.

72
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:26,780
Wait, we have characters?

73
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,260
Wait, you look Canadian.

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,800
What is your...

75
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,520
No one cares about an ex-Hollywood star.

76
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,460
Oh, you care.

77
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,660
You fucking are the other gay dad.

78
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,360
Okay, hold on.

79
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,140
I might join a cult one day instead of going into work.

80
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,700
I'm a competitive eating champion!

81
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Oh yeah, that's why they said I'm the cooler dad.

82
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,560
I need to put my outfit back on.

83
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,840
Is this pre-cult or post-cult?

84
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,520
This is post-cult and I own the cult.

85
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:17,060
Co-own the cult and these are the two children we had that we did not steal into our family.

86
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,300
That we didn't indoctrinate into the cult and brainwash them.

87
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,460
I don't look anything like you.

88
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,260
So, basically, this is what Tom Cruise wishes you.

89
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,540
Oh my god.

90
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,940
I don't think he wants to be a washed up actor.

91
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
That's true, other than that part.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,480
Okay, I bought my outfit so I don't feel like such a freaking plebian with you guys.

93
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,580
Oh,

95
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,890
yeah, man, you're apparently rude.

96
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,710
Oh, well, we're gonna be using in-game volume, though, guys.

97
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,950
So if she's too low, I'd have to fix her right now.

99
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,250
I don't think she's ever fixable.

100
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,270
I don't think.

101
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,290
Are we all ready?

102
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,130
I think so.

103
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,530
I wanted to be the short girl, but she didn't have any cool outfits, really.

104
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,410
Alright, so we have player collision is on.

105
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,070
Proximity voice is on.

106
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,610
Batteries are on.

107
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,130
And medkits are on.

108
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:31,850
And perks are on.

109
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,750
I don't know what the perks are, but they're also on.

110
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,130
I don't have any because I've never played the game.

111
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,190
Oh, that's true.

112
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,250
So we're going straight in with, like, everything you need.

113
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:41,750
Everything possible.

114
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,250
So...

115
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,730
I've never played this game.

116
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,250
Not really sure what we're capable of, but...

117
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,510
It's gonna be great.

118
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,590
We're gonna do great.

119
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,370
There's an objective, and also make sure you have voice enabled.

120
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,750
I'm gonna mute Discord now.

121
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:58,790
Yeah, me too.

122
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,170
Okay.

123
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,090
Alright.

124
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,510
Alright, I believe in us.

125
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,590
Do you guys believe?

126
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,710
Yeah.

127
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,270
Wait, let me see.

128
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,930
Let me see.

129
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,250
Can we, like, turn people up?

130
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,130
Maybe we can turn people up in-game, right?

131
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,290
I'm just turning down the music and the sound effects.

132
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,250
I'm turning up the game.

133
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,050
Oh, wait.

134
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,250
I forgot you could do that.

135
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,930
Right.

136
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,730
Okay, music, sound effects, and then...

137
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,790
I'll turn up the game more.

138
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:27,630
Alright.

139
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,030
Should be good.

140
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:31,590
Uh...

141
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:33,630
Okay.

142
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,410
Is this better?

143
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,170
Alright, guys.

144
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:35,910
Can you guys hear?

145
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,510
Can you guys hear me?

146
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,250
Okay,

147
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,990
I'll turn the music just a little bit down.

148
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,670
Because I don't want to hear the wedding...

149
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,070
The wedding thing for, like, the hundredth time.

150
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,510
I can't.

151
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,250
I can't.

152
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:52,710
Alright, guys.

153
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,330
I'm readying it up now.

154
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,670
We're gonna go on a vacation, children.

155
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,050
With your dads.

156
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:01,730
Alright.

157
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,110
One of our sons is, like, at our age.

158
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,830
He just works outdoors a lot.

159
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,510
Yeah, yeah, he just...

160
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,050
We've been telling you that you don't...

161
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,350
We've been telling you that you haven't aged past ten.

162
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,830
So we think you're still ten years old.

163
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,350
That's... yeah.

164
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,630
Like, don't worry.

165
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,150
It's your tenth birthday again.

166
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,190
Yay!

167
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,390
Waiting for presents from Santa.

168
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,430
You wanna sit on Santa's lap?

169
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,310
Snuffy?

170
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,130
That was his other costume.

171
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,930
It was a Santa outfit, actually.

172
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,010
Wait, really?

173
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,130
He can be Santa.

174
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,610
Oh my god, no, you're right.

175
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,530
No, she's Benjamin Button.

176
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,050
She's Benjamin Button-ing it right now.

177
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,610
Benjamin Button was based off of our son.

178
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,750
It's the real story.

179
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,670
It's the real story.

180
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,950
I need you to ready up.

181
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,270
Oh, sorry.

182
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:13,890
I'm ready.

183
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,430
I turned down my sound effects and brought up the game volume.

184
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,890
Let me know it's better, sound guy.

185
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,430
But we're going straight in.

186
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,120
What's this door?

187
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,280
Okay.

188
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,980
Oh, Azazel.

189
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,680
I know that from Supernatural.

190
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,160
Supernatural.

191
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,120
Wasn't he hot in Supernatural?

192
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,980
I can't remember.

193
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,980
That part.

194
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,040
That's how I know all the demons from Supernatural.

195
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,500
I know all the demons just because of Supernatural.

196
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,860
They were all hot.

197
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,260
Hello?

198
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,040
Wait, how do I turn- Oh, there you go.

199
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,420
Hello, guys.

200
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,640
Just so you guys know, our flashlight has batteries.

201
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Just so you guys know.

202
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,500
I think so, right?

203
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,740
It's alright.

204
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,020
If our flashlight dies, it dies.

205
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,440
That's UV.

206
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,720
The UV requires batteries.

207
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,680
So like our- The right click.

208
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:01,220
You know when we burn the monsters out, burn the ghost, then we go Wait, Snuffy's not alive yet.

209
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:10,240
Snuffy is trapped in the- Is it because you're scared?

210
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,220
Don't worry.

211
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,280
Don't worry, son.

212
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,940
It's all you stick with.

213
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,600
No daddy, you'll be fine.

214
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,640
Look,

215
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,020
it's our vacation!

216
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,500
It's my vacation!

217
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,420
When there's a demon that comes at you- By the way, that's limited battery.

218
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,000
But-

219
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,580
We need to find batteries for it.

220
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,700
But like, it's used to chase away the monsters.

221
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,660
So when we go to this house, there's gonna be an objective.

222
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,680
I don't know if it starts the objective when we're- When we find something.

223
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,980
I feel like this is like different from the previous ones too.

224
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,360
I don't know about you guys, but my character is fucking incapable of jumping.

225
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,040
She's like so heavy or something.

226
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,400
It's my rat!

227
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,910
Don't worry, chat.

228
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,430
I'll be here to pick you.

229
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,990
I'll be here to catch you.

230
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,770
Don't worry, son.

231
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,670
I'll catch you.

232
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,170
I got a medkit.

233
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,710
There's a crow on this basin.

234
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:45,750
Or fountain, even.

235
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,430
I think he's an evil crow.

236
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,730
He has blue eyes.

237
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,250
Glowing?

238
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,150
Yeah.

239
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,170
Wait, I think that's- Oh wait, he's looking at us!

240
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,050
When it turned down my- When it turned down my sound effects.

241
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,990
What's wrong?

242
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,350
I just got a pumpkin.

243
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,070
What's wrong, dad?

244
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:01,410
Oh.

245
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,430
Oh, we have to destroy pumpkins.

246
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,950
Collect 60- Okay, we are not collecting 60 pumpkins.

247
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,010
Are they fucking satanic pumpkins or something?

248
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,930
I have no idea.

249
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,870
Oh!

250
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,930
Oh, look, a skull.

251
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,590
Oh, there's a dead person!

252
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,010
Get out!

253
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,510
I wanna see!

254
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,170
Let's take a picture!

255
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,710
That's our family photo!

256
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,550
Guys, let's take a family photo with- Oh, wait, where's his head?

257
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,890
Is this a headless horseman?

258
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,190
Wait, he's a priest.

259
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,390
Guys, alright, children.

260
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,670
Guys, it's time for a family photo, everybody.

261
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,430
Next to the dead body.

262
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,730
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,630
Sorry, say cheese, everybody!

264
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,950
Cheese!

265
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,710
Cheese!

266
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,670
Yeah, cheese!

267
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,310
I have no idea.

268
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,130
Up close.

269
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,390
Yay!

270
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,650
What a great start to our family vacation!

271
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,710
Wait, so is my light gonna, like, die?

272
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,650
No, no, no.

273
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,870
Oh, there's another dead- Oh, wait, there's a woman.

274
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,730
There's a woman here.

275
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,730
That's my wife.

276
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,970
Don't disrespect- Oh, nevermind, that's a child.

277
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,610
Excuse me?

278
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,150
Excuse me?

279
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,090
I guess you're one of the bridesmaids.

280
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,670
You have to differentiate me!

281
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,350
I got a battery.

282
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,190
Is your rat useful?

283
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:38,570
Is he like a pig?

284
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,850
No, I think he just follows you.

285
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,930
I wish you got the pig.

286
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,530
Literally all he's doing is because a fucking player collision is on him, I keep getting stuck on him.

287
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,550
He's gonna rat you out.

288
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:54,630
Yeah, I wonder what happens, like, if you had the pig and you just have a fucking giant-ass pig following you around while you're getting chased.

289
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,470
Where do we go?

290
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,510
It was over this way before you ran off over the Oh, okay.

291
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,610
We just walked away to look at dead bodies.

292
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,570
I mean, we had to get our family photo.

293
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,410
The family photo was important, guys.

294
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,370
Oh, that's your wife!

295
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,450
There she is!

296
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,870
That's your dead wife.

297
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,710
That's my dead wife.

298
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,610
She's holding a camera.

299
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,410
That's your favorite thing.

300
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,810
In the bedroom.

301
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,070
Don't turn your black lights on around me, guys.

302
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,470
I'm a freak.

303
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,810
Is that another lady?

304
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,010
That's your grandma.

305
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,030
Oh, is that the chef?

306
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,270
It looks like a chef out there.

307
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,470
Oh, it does, yeah.

308
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,870
Jacob, the doorways.

309
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,890
Doorways are one people wide.

310
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:55,810
What?

311
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,790
Maybe I shouldn't put a collision on.

312
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,510
Oh.

313
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,930
Yeah, the door's locked.

314
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,690
Maybe there has to be a secret entrance somewhere.

315
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,020
The first struggle.

316
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,520
Finding the fucking door.

317
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,220
I've never played these games, so I'm relying on you guys.

318
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,020
Oh, there's a lab!

319
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,380
I've only played one or two.

320
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,920
Look, it's the Liza P protagonist.

321
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,840
Oh, hey!

322
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,800
He has a nice suit.

323
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,740
We both played Devoured, but apparently this map is different from the other Devour.

324
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
Oh, I think we parkour here, right?

325
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,940
Maybe up the tree?

326
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,720
Maybe.

327
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,100
Alright, guys, watch this.

328
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,360
Watch this, children.

329
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,700
This is how you do it.

330
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,540
Learn from us.

331
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,660
I don't really play these either, so it's gonna be great.

332
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,760
I think I'm stuck.

333
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,240
Wait, are you stuck?

334
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,340
Are you?

335
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,600
My dad's stuck.

336
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,260
We've been waiting in there for hours.

337
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,260
I can't even get...

338
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,420
Oh, we did it!

339
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,080
Okay, I need to turn my sense up.

340
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,220
My sensitivity is way too low.

341
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,600
I know, I had to turn mine up too.

342
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,180
Okay.

343
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,020
I wonder how long it's gonna take for one of us to get yoinked.

344
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,880
And then it takes like 10 years for anybody else to notice.

345
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,740
There's a window right there!

346
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,540
There's a door!

347
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,840
How do we get in?

348
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,620
Wait, there's another gate here.

349
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,400
Maybe we have to go to the gate over there.

350
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,340
Oh, there it is!

351
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,180
There's the other door.

352
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,380
Guys, we found it!

353
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,200
Guys, we found it!

354
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,780
We found the door!

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,100
Get over here, children!

356
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,260
Get over here.

357
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,580
Alright, Snuffy.

358
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,420
Okay, Snuffy, do you wanna be a...

359
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

360
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

361
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,960
Snuffy, do you wanna be a brave boy today?

362
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,840
Do you wanna be a man today?

363
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,820
Do you wanna be a man today?

364
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,960
No!

365
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,340
Oh, it's my rat.

366
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,020
My rat's a little special.

367
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,780
Wait, where did he go?

368
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,920
Oh my god, whose birthday is it?

369
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,720
Wait, there's a note.

370
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,320
Michael's dead.

371
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,700
Michael's dead.

372
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,400
I can't believe it.

373
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,140
He's dead.

374
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,820
What the fuck?

375
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,700
What is your character's...

376
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,180
Stop that.

377
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,520
Stop that.

378
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,900
How did you do that?

379
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,540
I got his voice right.

380
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,520
How did you do that?

381
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,460
Press Q.

382
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,680
Press the numbers.

383
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,240
The numbers.

384
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,400
Okay, man.

385
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,040
Come on!

386
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,140
What the fuck?

387
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,020
I maybe kinda spent like a dollar on the macaroon.

388
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,580
Oh my god, it's Fortnite!

389
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,820
It's Fortnite!

390
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,720
Bro, before you die, you got Macarena into it.

391
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,920
Oh my god, your rat is dancing too!

392
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,080
He's looking at me.

393
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,500
I got an item.

394
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,260
Oh, you can only pick one item.

395
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,440
You can only pick one.

396
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,520
I have a medkit.

397
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,160
I don't know.

398
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,500
This guy drew a heart in blood.

399
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,640
I can have a medkit.

400
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Or a booze bomb.

401
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,040
Can you bring yourself up a little bit in game?

402
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,600
You're a little quiet for me.

403
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,540
Compared to everybody.

404
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,660
Maybe a little bit more.

405
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,380
I don't know.

406
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,660
How do I do it in game?

407
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,240
Oh, I think it's a lot better.

408
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,960
Maybe because I have to be close to you.

409
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,380
Oh, there's another dead person.

410
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,480
Oh, there's a tunnel!

411
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,520
How did we miss the tunnel?

412
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,400
I saw the tunnel.

413
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,100
Are we guys ready?

414
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:16,680
I'm the British SpongeBob.

415
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,720
I'm ready.

416
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,380
Okay,

417
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,040
let's see.

418
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,040
I can fix this.

419
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,980
I've seen the ritual to summon a Zazel.

420
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,720
I think I can do it.

421
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,780
I'll make him open a portal to the realm of the dead.

422
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,080
Then I'll find Michael there and we can be together again.

423
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,580
Oh, sorry.

424
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,780
I just made the sacrifices.

425
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,440
Alright.

426
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,620
Well, I guess we...

427
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,460
I love how that's like a Professor Layton English voice.

428
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,160
It's very good.

429
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,440
This reminds me of a puzzle.

430
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,140
A puzzle, Professor?

431
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,760
Professor?

432
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,740
How many demons put away the books?

433
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,880
It's just like what if he went to a haunted house.

434
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,520
Whoa!

435
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,760
Whoa, where did she go?

436
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,400
She's in the...

437
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,680
You're in the mirror.

438
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,380
Oh my god!

439
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,960
Oh my god, it's freaky.

440
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,460
Okay, that...

441
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,020
That sat in the fucking tendrils.

442
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,860
Don't stand on the tendril that's gonna grab you.

443
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,460
What are we supposed to do over here?

444
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,400
Oh my god, it's so spooky.

445
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,580
Whoa, the ambience here.

446
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,080
Wait, there's people inside that door.

447
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,960
Yeah, I hear them crying.

448
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,080
Wait, you think it's a ghost?

449
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,400
Maybe, maybe we should go... Wait, I hear them on the other side.

450
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
This is like Stranger Things.

451
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,380
We're in the other world.

452
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,520
We're in the other worlds.

453
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,100
We gotta get the flickering lights to communicate with our children.

454
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,220
Oh, there's another note here.

455
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,920
Let's see.

456
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,320
That's a bunch of names.

457
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:31,400
John, Jasmine, Hakeem, Nicholas, Eric, Tyra, Madison, Ashley, Christopher, Ellie...

458
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,380
The upside down.

459
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,980
The upside down.

460
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,200
Wait, there's another mirror here.

461
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,100
Oh, hey, Peekaboo!

462
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,500
We're back!

463
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
We're back!

464
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,560
Wait, what did you see?

465
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,680
You opened the door?

466
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,280
Why did you open the door?

467
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,460
Why did you open the door?

468
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,200
You're not supposed to touch anything!

469
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,660
That's the number one rule!

470
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,340
Don't touch anything!

471
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,520
What?

472
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,520
But I've been picking up all the cake.

473
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,380
What did you do?

474
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,120
What did you do?

475
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,220
That's literally Horror Movie 101!

476
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,760
Don't touch random things!

477
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,900
Why would we be here if we're not meant to touch stuff?

478
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,040
We're meant to touch everything.

479
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,720
We're meant to touch everything.

480
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,300
Okay,

481
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,340
we'll go with...

482
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,300
Alright, your turn.

483
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,920
Alright, we're good.

484
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,640
Bye, Snuffy!

485
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,360
By the way, we left Snuffy, by the way.

486
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,880
She's literally walking around talking to herself right now.

487
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,320
Oh, there you are!

488
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,100
Alright.

489
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,140
Alright, it's time to go in.

490
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,540
Oh, there she is!

491
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,900
Did I get her?

492
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,500
I think so.

493
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,440
No, I think we're supposed to interact.

494
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,700
Alright, Snuffy, time for another big boy moment.

495
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,060
Don't you wanna be a man, Snuffy?

496
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,900
Guys...

497
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,280
Oh, yeah, I don't think she appreciated it.

498
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,560
Oh my god, you did it!

499
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,240
Now you're a real man.

500
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,020
Now you'll have a girlfriend, son.

501
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,380
Now you won't be a disappointment no more.

502
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,560
That's true.

503
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,700
I'm in the other world.

504
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,320
Hey, guys, get over here in the other world!

505
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,720
Oh my god, there are painters!

506
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,100
Oh, there's a key!

507
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,020
I got a key!

508
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,780
I got a key!

509
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,260
I got a key!

510
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,020
I grabbed a balcony key.

511
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,940
Oh my god, that's a painting of a child.

512
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,740
A child walking into a tree doorway magical entrance.

513
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,500
That legitimately looks like the park you have to clean in Power Wash Sim.

514
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,340
Oh, yeah, that's true!

515
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,300
It is!

516
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,220
Maybe they got a screenshot of that and then just, you know, in Photoshop, you can just do Paintify.

517
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,460
I don't understand why every VTuber knows which park it is.

518
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,400
I literally just did the Power Wash Sim today for a Shrek DLC.

519
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,440
It just came out.

520
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,720
Was it good?

521
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,280
Oh, there's feathers too?

522
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,400
What is this game?

523
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,800
Oh, I was gonna do that next week.

524
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,300
Was it good?

525
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,280
Yeah, but you need a... Okay, it was... The Shrek Swamp is literally the last level.

526
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,140
So you have to go through so much just to get the swamp.

527
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,620
I literally cleaned for four hours.

528
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,540
And, like, banned one person.

529
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,120
I banned a person after it.

530
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,740
Oh, I know!

531
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,820
You banned a Shrek-related streamer!

532
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,980
Yeah, was the Shrek level the only one?

533
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,760
What did you have to do?

534
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,860
No, there's three levels.

535
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,380
I think there's... I don't know if there's more than three.

536
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,320
But the first level is Lord Farquaad's place.

537
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,520
The second level is literally the Shrek honeymoon house.

538
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,580
And then the third one is the swamp.

539
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,620
How did you know about... Oh, I got the key.

540
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,420
How did you...

541
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,980
How did you know about the grass story?

542
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,140
How did you know?

543
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,740
How did you know about grass?

544
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,560
Oh, because grass came to my chat and was just like...

545
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,160
He knows what he did.

546
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,040
He knows what he did.

547
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,520
Oh, it's just a mention.

548
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,380
Let's go see what they're doing.

549
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,380
He's creepy.

550
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,060
Let's not look at him anymore.

551
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,260
Who's creepy?

552
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,860
Oh, he's like waddling in there.

553
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,940
Oh, no, thank you.

554
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,760
Who is?

555
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,620
Look at the... There's a head.

556
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:20,720
There is?

557
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,580
I think we have to burn it with the...

558
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,820
Wait, is he biting my fucking ankles?

559
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,920
What am I hearing dying?

560
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,340
What the fuck is that noise?

561
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,180
Oh, he's over there.

562
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,260
Oh, he is.

563
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,580
Wait, we gotta follow the head.

564
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,980
Follow the head.

565
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,000
Look, he's crying.

566
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,960
You're torturing him.

567
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,120
What if we double-team him?

568
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,320
Yeah, what if we double-team him?

569
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,540
I get him from behind.

570
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:51,960
Yeah.

571
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,540
Where is he trying to go?

572
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,960
Is he trying to go back to his home?

573
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,300
There's a lady!

574
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,640
Oh, God.

575
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,960
I don't know if you can burn her.

576
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,820
Wait, you can?

577
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,040
Maybe when she's aggravated, right?

578
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:07,780
Maybe.

579
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,080
Oh, you cannot.

580
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,400
I don't think you're supposed to touch her.

581
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,680
Oh, my God.

582
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,920
I'm going to the...

583
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,040
The other world.

584
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,020
I'm with you.

585
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,620
I'm with you.

586
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,360
Alright, well, we have to go back so we can get to the head.

588
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,280
Right?

589
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,080
What do we do with the cake and stuff?

590
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,580
Maybe it's like health.

591
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,740
Yeah.

592
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,960
I have no idea.

593
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,860
Alright, is it fine?

594
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,120
Is it safe, Stealthy?

595
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,660
Guys, I hear growling inside the mirror.

596
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,060
Okay, the ghost is currently in the room banging her head against the wall.

597
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,720
Oh, okay.

598
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,340
Oh.

599
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:41,980
Yeah.

600
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,720
That should be fine.

601
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,920
Yeah, let's just go follow the head now.

602
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Let's just go, yeah.

603
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,960
Where did the head go?

605
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,400
Oh, there she is!

606
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,020
There's the head!

607
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,500
Alright.

608
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
Okay, follow her.

609
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,440
Where are you gonna go?

610
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,460
Where is he going?

611
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,680
Wait, he's going backwards.

612
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,240
Are we supposed to kill it?

613
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,680
There's a bunch of names on this.

614
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,860
Wait, did we kill this?

615
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,400
Where are you killing?

616
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,160
Oh, I killed it!

617
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:12,980
Oh!

618
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:18,780
Oh, I'm okay.

619
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,060
Oh, oh, yeah, she's dead.

620
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,060
Yeah, she's dead.

621
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,500
Did you touch her?

622
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,920
Did you touch her?

623
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,040
You're not supposed to touch her!

624
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,300
Hold on, I left my medkit in there.

625
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,500
Did you guys touch the spaghetti sauce?

626
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,340
No, no, she touched a lady.

627
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,740
She touched a woman.

628
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,040
No, I touched the tentacles again.

629
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,300
You guys stopped doing that.

630
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,420
The therapist told you guys to stop touching those tentacles.

631
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,160
I thought I killed them!

632
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,400
Wait, what do we do?

633
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,760
I can't interact with the head guy.

634
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,960
He didn't seem to care that I was lighting him up.

635
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
No, he didn't really do anything.

636
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,940
Yeah, should we just follow the head?

637
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,040
We just follow it?

638
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,040
There's like a door that opened.

639
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,480
Oh, wait, this door is open too.

640
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,100
Some of these doors weren't open before.

641
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,160
That's true.

642
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,100
I wonder if we open them in the shadow, if it opens...

643
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,960
Oh, are we supposed to put the cake...

644
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,900
No, right?

645
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,040
Yeah, that was meant, I think.

646
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,120
Put the cake back together.

647
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,960
All the plates, yeah.

648
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,080
That will stop the demons.

649
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,200
What, then she knows it's like happy birthday!

650
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,900
Wait, I'm gonna go find a piece of cake and I'll come back to put it together.

651
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,140
Wait, no, I have a piece of cake.

652
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,320
I can't put it back down.

653
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
It's too late, she's gone.

654
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,060
It's too late, she's gone.

655
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,520
Let's let them do their thing.

656
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,680
You need the kitchen key, apparently.

657
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,640
Oh, okay, we just gotta find the kitchen key.

658
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,040
There was a door upstairs that opened that I don't think was open before, but I'm a little bitch baby, so I don't wanna go look.

659
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,780
Don't worry, there's a closet key here.

660
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,860
Oh, there's another door here!

661
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,040
Oh, we opened... oh, wait, no, this is the...

662
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,840
Alright, we opened that...

663
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,380
Oh, that's the front door.

664
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,880
Oh, nice!

666
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,340
What's up here in this one?

667
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,840
Is there a time limit on these?

668
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,960
No, no, no, I think we just... I think it's the other world.

669
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,920
What if we bring the cake to the other world?

670
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,080
Oh, you got the closet key!

671
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,520
Wait, I know where the closet key is.

672
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,540
Come follow me, Mint.

673
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,120
Wait, where's Mint?

674
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,860
Oh, we found the creepy children's bedroom.

675
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,980
Oh, the children... Okay, wait, I wanna see the children first.

676
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,020
Or the kids.

677
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,500
I don't remember seeing a second dead kid, so...

678
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:37,840
Okay.

679
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,460
Are we gonna get haunted by another one?

680
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,500
There's so many books on the floor.

681
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,520
Oh, what's this?

682
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,860
Seven days to go.

683
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,600
Can't wait to see you walk down that aisle.

684
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,040
Back at six, I'll cook.

685
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,940
Okay, there's an upstairs bedroom.

686
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,580
What's this?

687
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,200
You're upstairs?

688
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

689
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,160
No, we're coming back down.

690
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,080
We should come back downstairs.

691
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,060
She has the keys.

692
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,040
Sure.

693
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,660
We'll come back downstairs.

694
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,120
There's a closet below.

695
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,340
Wait, I'll grab the children.

696
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,360
Kids!

697
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:12,860
Kids!

698
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,640
Kids, we got the keys, kids!

699
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,900
Dude, check this out!

700
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,780
Look at this!

701
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,400
Here it is.

702
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,100
A wag over here?

703
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,060
Oh no.

704
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,900
A wag over here.

705
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,920
Alright, kids.

706
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,560
We gotta go get... We gotta go to the closet and the kitchen.

707
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,440
Min has the closet key and the kitchen key.

708
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,640
Maybe I should not put player collision on.

709
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,220
Maybe...

710
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,300
You decided this.

711
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,480
It's the real devour experience.

712
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,020
It's true, true, it is.

713
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,740
We're pushing each other out of the door.

714
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,660
One person blocks the door for everybody else.

715
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,120
Where is... It was like here.

716
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,860
This is the... Is this... No.

717
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,000
There was a closet door somewhere.

718
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,580
Oh, what is this though?

719
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,080
Oh, this is where the wedding happened.

720
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,300
Oh, is this the wedding?

721
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,940
Whoa, okay.

722
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,380
This looks really fucking scary.

723
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,380
Hey, this... That looks like a scary...

724
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,720
That's his house.

725
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,660
See, that's his whole house.

726
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,180
Oh, there's the dead husband.

727
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,440
Where... Oh, there he is!

728
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,560
I hope he had a great time.

729
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,600
Where did...

730
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,060
Oh, it's a... It's a development room for photographs.

731
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,740
Is there anything in here?

732
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,380
Oh, there's more... Alright, alright, Stuffy.

733
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,020
What does it say?

734
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,500
Azazel made me do it.

735
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,760
Azazel made me do it.

736
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,640
Azazel made me...

737
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,280
That's what it says.

738
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,160
Oh, hey, I have a shovel.

739
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,000
Whoa, that's Raw's hat.

740
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,020
Can you hit the ghost with that?

741
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,920
I think so, maybe.

742
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,780
Why else would I have a shovel?

743
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,080
Oh, maybe I get the shovel and then, like, bury the bodies after getting their heads back there.

744
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,820
Oh, this is how we're gonna find out which head goes on which head!

745
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,800
Guys, this is how we're gonna find out.

746
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,920
But, like, I don't...

747
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,560
I don't remember which head... What was the head that we saw?

748
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,930
Are we supposed to chase...

749
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,050
He had, like, a little bacon and I couldn't tell at all.

750
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,830
Yeah, like, he got... He was all, like, decomposed and everything.

751
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,070
How the fuck...

752
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,910
How the fuck are we supposed to figure out?

753
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,230
They were all decomposed.

754
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,370
The bride has, like, a flower crown, I guess.

755
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,650
I guess, like...

756
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,570
I don't know, maybe the bride made it.

757
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,530
Do you think they'll have the...

758
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,950
Maybe, like, maybe it's this guy.

759
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:36,690
Which one?

760
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,610
That guy.

761
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,030
Cause I think, like, the other one...

762
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,530
I think they maybe have glasses on.

763
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,930
Maybe we're gonna supposed to chase the head.

764
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,190
We're supposed to chase the head to the bodies.

765
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,370
I don't think so.

766
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,890
Then why the fuck... Why would I have a shovel?

767
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:57,570
Why would there be photos of heads?

768
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,310
And then running heads?

769
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,490
I think you should...

770
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,750
Can you, like, put the soil back in?

771
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,490
No.

772
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,670
I think we're supposed to...

773
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,590
I'm pretty sure we're supposed to...

774
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,310
And then...

775
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,910
And then bury it.

776
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,390
It's like a delivery service.

777
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,210
Oh my god.

778
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,310
That's you.

779
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,670
Oh my god.

780
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,490
What if that's...

781
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,030
That's you.

782
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,410
That's you before you died.

783
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:27,830
That's literally me.

784
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,410
That's literally you.

785
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,810
Where did your head go?

786
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,510
We took you back to where you died.

787
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,570
Bury me, Doki.

788
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,190
The lore!

789
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,250
You're happier as a phantom.

790
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,490
What's over there?

791
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,530
Oh, nice.

792
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,970
Okay, that's downstairs.

793
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:53,850
Wait, we have to...

794
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,230
Oh, wait, wait.

795
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,450
Min has the kitchen key.

796
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,210
Min has the kitchen key.

797
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,730
Wait, wait, wait.

798
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,370
Since we opened this area, maybe the ghost will run here.

799
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,670
Maybe the ghost head will run here now.

800
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,170
Where the fuck are we?

801
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,490
How many dead bodies?

802
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,590
Oh, there's a gardener.

803
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,590
No, it's a gardener.

804
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,610
That's the pig thing.

805
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,090
Bro, she fucked...

806
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,510
That guy got beheaded.

807
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,450
Do you think he wants to get beheaded?

808
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,410
Maybe.

809
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,550
Wait, there's a crypt here.

810
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,310
There's a bigger grave.

811
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,630
I think there's a grave here, too.

812
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,810
Oh, this is where they summoned Azazel.

813
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,570
Wait, this is where we were!

814
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,510
We were here!

815
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,250
Oh!

816
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,850
Oh, hey, I found her.

817
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,490
So we found the loop-de-loop.

818
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,090
We found the loop-de-loop.

819
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,950
Also, chat, is the volume better now?

820
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,970
Is my sound better?

821
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,690
Can you hear everybody?

822
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,090
Or is people too loud?

823
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,370
Wait, we can open the kitchen key.

824
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,450
Minh has the kitchen.

825
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,390
It is right here.

826
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,770
Right here, yeah, yeah.

827
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,590
Oh, hey, there's a pig!

828
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,930
There's your pet pig!

829
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,230
There you go.

830
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,730
There's more cake.

831
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,750
Wait, let's get to the other world.

832
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,690
Wait, there's the other world.

833
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,530
Is this safe?

834
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,690
Oh, there's a head in here.

835
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,550
He can't get out.

836
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,870
Oh, I told you!

837
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,970
We gotta lead him!

838
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,390
Or let him out.

839
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,130
Let him out!

840
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,430
No, we gotta let him out!

841
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,550
I'm leading him out!

842
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,350
I can't hit him with the shovel!

843
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,010
Go!

844
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,370
Go!

845
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,850
Go to your head!

846
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,370
Wait, I think we're supposed to herd them to the bodies.

847
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,130
Oh, we're herding them!

848
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,270
We're herding the pets!

849
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,730
Oh shit, am I...

850
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,570
Who's getting hit by the...

851
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:34,810
Alright,

852
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,390
herd the heads!

853
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,470
Herd the heads to the bodies!

854
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,310
That's almost like maybe feeding cake.

855
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,690
Take him to outside.

856
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,050
We got the outside door.

857
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,310
We should take him to the outside like a good dog.

858
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,330
Good dog, good dog.

859
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,170
Good dog, good dog.

860
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,610
Wait, why do we have two heads now?

861
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:55,930
Oh god.

862
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,270
Because we found two heads!

863
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,970
Yeah, there's like a second head.

864
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,230
Wait, try the cake?

865
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,090
Who has a cake?

866
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,870
Wait, who has...

867
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,390
Who has a cake?

868
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,270
Oh my god, wait!

869
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,130
They're meeting!

870
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,050
The dogs are meeting!

871
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,610
Alright, are you guys having a good time?

872
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,270
Are you two...

873
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,650
Are you guys becoming friends?

874
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,350
Oh look, they're playing with each other!

875
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,210
We're the worst dog walkers ever!

876
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,010
Wait, what's that?

877
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,190
What's that?

878
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,830
Oh, I'm going to the other world!

879
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,950
I think we're in trouble.

880
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,290
As long as we're here, we'll be fine, right?

881
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,630
Wait, I'm gonna try to feed...

882
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:41,970
I don't know.

883
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,350
Let's just hide in the kitchen.

884
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,250
Yeah, let's just...

885
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:44,990
No, let's bring...

886
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,830
Somebody's...

887
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,570
Why'd you get rid of your weapon?

888
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,010
It doesn't work!

889
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,670
I'm trying to...

890
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,130
Somebody said we should feed the heads cake!

891
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,510
Feed them cake?

892
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,350
Yeah, they said to feed them cake!

893
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,070
Are you guys okay?

894
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,450
No!

895
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,890
What happened?

896
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,910
Wait, she's in the other world!

897
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,390
She's here, we go back to there!

898
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:11,010
Alright, do you want some cake?

899
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,890
How did you get over there?

900
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,850
Hello?

901
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,290
Oh my god, am I still alive?

902
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,550
Yeah, you are.

903
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,950
I'm not alive on the other side.

904
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:26,550
Hello?

905
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:28,410
What?

906
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:29,950
Oh, there you are!

907
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,670
We're on the... Oh, there you are!

908
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,330
How are you alive?

909
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,750
She snapped your spine!

910
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,630
She got better.

911
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,350
Look, I'm good.

912
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:36,990
She got better.

913
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,430
That was the scariest thing I've ever experienced in my entire life.

914
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,790
She snapped your fucking spine and you disintegrated.

915
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,210
Do you want the cake, little guy?

916
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,390
You want it?

917
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,810
Wait, wait, he's walking away!

918
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,290
Wait, wait, he's walking away!

919
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:47,750
Drop the cake!

920
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,470
Drop the cake!

921
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,730
Drop Gigi, press G!

922
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,450
He was walking over!

923
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,290
G, G, G!

924
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,950
Press G, press G!

925
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,470
G, G, G, baby!

926
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,150
Watch, watch!

927
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,850
Oh my god, you got this!

928
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,930
You got this, boy!

929
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,310
Little dog!

930
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,370
Little dog!

931
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,810
Go, go!

932
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:01,970
Come on!

933
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:02,770
Come on!

934
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,630
Oh, good boy!

935
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:05,830
She disappeared!

936
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,690
You have the head.

937
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,690
Oh, I have the head?

938
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,310
Is the head on me?

939
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,250
Where's the head?

940
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,150
I have...

941
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,350
I have them in my inventory.

942
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,690
Gigi, the witch is in the real world now.

943
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:24,070
She went through the mirror and killed Snuffy, and now she's out there.

944
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,190
And Snuffy is, for some reason, still alive.

945
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,590
Snuffy, can you go back through the mirror?

946
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,710
Do you die again?

947
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,710
I mean...

948
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,970
No, I revived her.

949
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,430
Oh, okay, okay.

950
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,570
Alright, okay, so...

951
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,230
Yeah, you fucking disintegrated on my screen.

952
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,090
Okay, so there's bodies...

953
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:43,410
Okay, so, all we have to do is that we just have to...

954
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,850
We have to go outside.

955
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,030
We have to get the...

956
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,230
There's bodies outside, so we piece those heads to that body.

957
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,750
Do we have to go back to the real world then?

958
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,310
Yeah, I think so.

959
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,250
It doesn't matter whose body it is.

960
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,190
Okay, so we go back to the real world and find the bodies?

961
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,050
Yeah, there's a grave over there.

962
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,170
Wait, does anyone...

963
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,190
We need to find a cake, then.

964
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:03,730
We have to go to the other world.

965
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,550
Everyone should grab a head.

966
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,850
Yeah, but we need to find more cake.

967
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,050
We need to feed them cake first.

968
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,170
I swear there was so much cake before.

969
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,150
I think it's on the other world.

970
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,230
It's in the other world.

971
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,230
Oh, okay, okay.

972
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,010
We might need to go back to the normal world for cake.

973
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:20,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

974
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,770
Wait, who has the shovel?

975
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,450
The shovel's gone.

976
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,310
It's in the normal world.

977
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,370
Oh, I left it in the normal world.

978
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:26,950
The shovel is right here.

979
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,530
Okay, okay, I'll grab the shovel.

980
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,010
I'll grab it just in case.

981
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,050
Alright, we just gotta find cake.

982
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,390
Do you want to go and try and attach that head?

983
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,110
Yeah, let's see if it works.

984
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:42,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

985
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:43,890
And I have the shovel with me.

986
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,010
I'm scared of the lady, though.

987
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:45,630
Don't worry.

988
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,690
She's right there.

989
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,170
She's right there.

990
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:47,910
Wait, she's on your right.

991
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:48,930
She's out inside.

992
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,710
No, no, she's inside.

993
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,570
We're outside now.

994
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:50,870
Okay.

995
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,070
Does it work?

996
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,070
Oh, the head must be cleansed before playing.

997
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,690
What the hell does that mean?

998
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:55,910
What the fuck does that mean?

999
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,110
Maybe back to the creepy ritual room?

1000
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,170
Maybe.

1001
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,470
Maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1002
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,170
In the coffin or whatever.

1003
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:07,230
Oh, yeah, yeah, someone said clean it with alcohol in the altar.

1004
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,350
We need to find alcohol.

1005
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,650
What?

1006
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,290
Oh, that's all the booze.

1007
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:11,890
This way, then.

1008
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1009
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,110
Oh, my God.

1010
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:15,790
How much is there?

1011
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,110
I didn't realize those were like story relevant items.

1012
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,970
I like how we just pour some booze on it to fix it.

1013
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:20,570
Okay.

1014
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:21,810
Oh, here's some.

1015
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:22,110
Okay.

1016
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:22,490
Yeah.

1017
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,470
Don't worry.

1018
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,150
Wow.

1019
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,590
If it can clean wounds, it can clean heads.

1020
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:29,730
Okay.

1021
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,390
That's what rubbing alcohol taught me.

1022
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,330
Oh, my God.

1023
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,030
Oh, my God.

1024
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:34,790
Oh, my God.

1025
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:35,790
Clean it.

1026
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:36,910
Give it a little bath.

1027
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,150
Give the little boy a bath.

1028
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,890
It's our little pet.

1029
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,390
Oh, my God.

1030
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:43,930
There's a head.

1031
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,170
Oh, she's a lady.

1032
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,670
Oh, she's beautiful.

1033
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,590
Wait, can you drop the head so we can look at it?

1034
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:51,930
Oh.

1035
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:52,790
Oh.

1036
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,350
That looks like a maid.

1037
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,570
Do you think that's a maid?

1038
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:58,510
I think that's you.

1039
00:43:59,010 --> 00:43:59,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1040
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,750
Wait, how do I grab it?

1041
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,330
E.

1042
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,630
E.

1043
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,110
Oh, wait.

1044
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,470
Okay.

1045
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:03,990
Okay.

1046
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:04,250
Okay.

1047
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:04,690
Let's...

1048
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,110
Here you go.

1049
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:05,650
There you go.

1050
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:06,430
Sin.

1051
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:09,110
The backyard.

1052
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:09,870
Oh, there it is.

1053
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:10,530
Okay, okay.

1054
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,150
Yeah, yeah.

1055
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:11,850
No, no.

1056
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:12,770
Lime has it.

1057
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,410
Lime has it.

1058
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,090
We need to go find her now.

1059
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,290
We can look at the pictures again.

1060
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,990
There weren't that many pictures, though.

1061
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,210
There weren't that many pictures.

1062
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:27,450
What if we... What if we find whoever... They don't care whose head they get.

1063
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:28,250
Like, whatever.

1064
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,050
Yeah, I know.

1065
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,150
As long as they're like, you know...

1066
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,710
Oh, oh.

1067
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,650
Oh, oh.

1068
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,970
Oh, she is...

1069
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:36,070
Oh, oh.

1070
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,110
Back in the tiny cavern.

1071
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,650
Back in the tiny cavern that would play your collision.

1072
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,050
Let's go this way.

1073
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:43,870
I don't think we can.

1074
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,130
We don't have stamina to jump.

1075
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,030
Oh.

1076
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:51,810
Oh, we can't go out.

1077
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:52,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1078
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,730
It's a one-way entrance.

1079
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:55,270
Oh, my God.

1080
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:55,590
Okay.

1081
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,450
Well, she can only kill one person.

1082
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:00,010
Did she leave?

1083
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:00,890
Okay, guys.

1084
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,190
Come on.

1085
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,470
Come on.

1086
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:01,970
Alright.

1087
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:03,410
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1088
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,350
I don't have anything.

1089
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,290
I'm gonna grab... Yeah, grab the cake.

1090
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:06,790
Grab the cake.

1091
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,310
There's another piece of cake here.

1092
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:08,850
Okay.

1093
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,930
I'm gonna take the shovel, because I'm...

1094
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,450
There's a bathroom key.

1095
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:12,530
Lime had it, right?

1096
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,270
This one.

1097
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:13,650
This one.

1098
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:14,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1099
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,590
One of the heads might be stuck in the bathroom.

1100
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:18,370
There we go.

1101
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,250
I should find where to put this one, though, before I get killed.

1102
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,070
There is a cake in here.

1103
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,610
Yeah, let's figure out the...

1104
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:25,950
Oh, maybe it's in the ghost world?

1105
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,130
Let's go outside.

1106
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:27,630
Let's go outside.

1107
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:29,890
Alright, where's...

1108
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:30,410
Did she come out here?

1109
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,430
I don't know, but...

1110
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:32,830
Let's go...

1111
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:33,590
Wait.

1112
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,970
The head does not belong here.

1113
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:35,530
Wait.

1114
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,470
Is it her?

1115
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,630
The head does not belong here.

1116
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,350
How do we get to the maid area?

1117
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:41,330
Remember the maid?

1118
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,110
It was like, in the back of the house.

1119
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,690
I think it's the maid.

1120
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,550
It has to be.

1121
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,430
Try putting it on this...

1122
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:51,630
Lime did.

1123
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,590
Oh my God, so we actually have to guess?

1124
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,750
No, it's in the photos, remember?

1125
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,290
The photos that we saw there.

1126
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,530
Yeah, but there weren't that many photos.

1127
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,230
The audio cut off.

1128
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:06,530
Is she there?

1129
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,970
I think the audio...

1130
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:08,590
Are you guys okay?

1131
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:09,710
Oh, there she is.

1132
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,090
You guys okay?

1133
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,090
Oh, hello.

1134
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:11,650
Hello.

1135
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:13,690
Um...

1136
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:13,890
Oh.

1137
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,530
What's she doing?

1138
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,410
She's crawling on her knees.

1139
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:17,250
Getting...

1140
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:17,390
Oh.

1141
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:18,370
Oh.

1142
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,030
Hey there.

1143
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:20,690
Oh.

1144
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,890
Are you okay, ma'am?

1145
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:29,890
A week of hard work right there.

1146
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,310
When the week is fun.

1147
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,270
Okay, I got it.

1148
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:38,910
This way.

1149
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:39,270
What?

1150
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:40,890
We need the shovel.

1151
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:41,750
The corpse is freaking out.

1152
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,150
It's wanting attention.

1153
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:43,990
Oh my God.

1154
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:44,730
Where is it?

1155
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,210
Is she okay?

1156
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:45,950
I knew it.

1157
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,130
See, I told you.

1158
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,550
I told you.

1159
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,650
I told you that's the maid.

1160
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,130
I could see the maid.

1161
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:54,490
Alright, get in there.

1162
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,570
Bury you alive.

1163
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,830
So you can be returned your soul to the body.

1164
00:46:59,390 --> 00:46:59,870
Return your soul to the body.

1165
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,090
Go back to where you belong.

1166
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,270
Midden Hell.

1167
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,150
Oh, she's angry.

1168
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:12,870
Oh, oh, oh.

1169
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,050
Wait, why is she on me?

1170
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,090
It's the crows!

1171
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,410
The crows are...

1172
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,870
The crows are...

1173
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:28,380
Hello?

1174
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,240
Are you okay?

1175
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:30,900
Yeah, I'm okay.

1176
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:31,520
Where did everybody go?

1177
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,280
I don't know.

1178
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,460
I don't know.

1179
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,120
I'm scared.

1180
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:34,800
I'm scared.

1181
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,340
I'm so scared, son.

1182
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,920
Where's Lyman?

1183
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,680
Son, I'm so scared.

1184
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,260
Oh my God.

1185
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,420
Okay, let's go to the crypt.

1186
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,160
Let's go to the crypt.

1187
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:43,940
Let's go to the crypt.

1188
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,660
Okay, okay, okay.

1189
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,660
Follow dad.

1190
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,420
Follow dad.

1191
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:46,980
Don't worry.

1192
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,300
Don't worry.

1193
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,280
Let's go to the crypt.

1194
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:52,560
Okay, here, here.

1195
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,160
Oh my God.

1196
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,220
I have alcohol, so I'm just gonna pre-put the alcohol in the thing.

1197
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,100
I'm gonna need them myself.

1198
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,720
I still have cake.

1199
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,900
I should've grabbed one of my alcohols.

1200
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,020
Yeah, I'm just pre-putting it now.

1201
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,020
What happened to Lyman?

1202
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,100
Did they just vanish?

1203
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,920
I think they ran inside.

1204
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,340
I think they ran inside.

1205
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:13,980
Okay.

1206
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,480
So, we have to go back in.

1207
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,540
Are you guys alive?

1208
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,680
Hello?

1209
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,340
Lyman?

1210
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,220
Hello?

1211
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,670
Look out, the crows.

1212
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:32,830
What's that light?

1213
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,570
That's them, that's them.

1214
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:35,270
I think that's them.

1215
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,710
In front of the house.

1216
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,170
She ran inside.

1217
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:39,470
Oh.

1218
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:40,770
Oh God.

1219
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,730
We gotta go to the other world.

1220
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,960
Stuffy, Stuffy, go to the other world.

1221
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,060
Stuffy, come over here.

1222
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,640
Son!

1223
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,840
Get over here.

1224
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:53,840
Grab the cake.

1225
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,460
Feed him, feed him.

1226
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,780
Press G, press G.

1227
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,460
Come on, little boy.

1228
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,180
Come on.

1229
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,140
Come on, you know you want that cake.

1230
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,940
Who wants that little cake?

1231
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,660
You guys can't all be hungry.

1232
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,140
I think they're all hungry.

1233
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,320
Somebody's crying, somebody's crying.

1234
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:10,780
Is she coming?

1235
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,480
Oh.

1236
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,580
Oh, we gotta grab him.

1237
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,660
We didn't grab him!

1238
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,940
We were supposed to grab him when he was eating!

1239
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:17,580
He took the cake!

1240
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,880
He just took the fucking cake!

1241
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,300
We were supposed to grab him while he was eating!

1242
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,180
I got another cake.

1243
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,280
Don't worry, I got another cake.

1244
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,540
Okay, okay.

1245
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,200
Right here, right here.

1246
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,460
Alright, little guy.

1247
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,560
Alright, come eat the cake.

1248
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,220
Come eat the cake, little guy.

1249
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,640
You know you want to.

1250
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:37,620
You know...

1251
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,620
Alright, I got one of the heads.

1252
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,380
Okay, we should put all the heads...

1253
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:45,080
We should put all the heads near the altar, because every time you put the body into a head, she gets angrier.

1254
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,160
Yeah, she gets angrier.

1255
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,980
Okay, there was another one.

1256
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,460
Alright, let's like...

1257
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,580
Let's head back downstairs.

1258
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,400
I'm heading back downstairs.

1259
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,580
Oh my god, we got the cake.

1260
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,580
Okay, she gets angry, so I'm scared of her getting angry.

1261
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,100
There we go.

1262
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,580
Oh, what?!

1263
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,760
You run away if I drop you, you little fucker!

1264
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:11,980
We need another cake.

1265
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,760
Do you have another cake?

1266
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,700
I didn't realize...

1267
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,300
No, don't drop the...

1268
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,380
I didn't realize he runs away!

1269
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,580
Maybe we should cleanse them?

1270
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,380
Yeah, cleanse them and then drop them.

1271
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1272
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,920
They can't run after we cleanse them.

1273
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,060
Can we run out of cake?

1274
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,280
I don't think so.

1275
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,980
There's no way.

1276
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,980
There must be enough cake.

1277
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,620
Guys, guys, we found... we figured out a strat.

1278
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,280
We have to just...

1279
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,020
Oh, what?

1280
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,620
But she sounds like she's calm now.

1281
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,640
Did you guys chill her out?

1282
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,240
I used the UV light on her.

1283
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,340
Oh, okay.

1284
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,260
So, like, we clean a bunch of heads and then drop... put it in the altar after we clean them.

1285
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,500
So then, like, you know how when we put the heads in the body, they get angrier?

1286
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,240
So all we have to do is just, like, have a pile of clean heads at the altar.

1287
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:03,640
Okay.

1288
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,780
I have a head currently.

1289
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1290
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,740
Come with me.

1291
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,420
I cleansed... I have alcohol already in the altar.

1292
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:11,940
Okay, okay.

1293
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,740
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1294
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,500
Come here.

1295
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:15,700
Alright.

1296
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,320
I'll grab this one, too, just cause...

1297
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:19,520
Okay.

1298
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,000
So we can head downstairs.

1299
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,080
Alright, alright, alright.

1300
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:23,620
Downstairs.

1301
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,060
I thought the cake would make them... I dropped a head in the tomb, by the way.

1302
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,360
Because I didn't realize he would run after I dropped him, but he...

1303
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,080
I think she only gets aggroed...

1304
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,300
I think she only gets aggroed once we bury the body.

1305
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,720
So we can probably attach the heads and then go around and bury the body.

1306
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,660
Oh, that's true!

1307
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,580
That's true!

1308
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,380
Yeah, we can do that.

1309
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,620
I'll fill it up again, too.

1310
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:45,880
Oh.

1311
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,820
Uh, I think a little guy just escaped.

1312
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,100
There's a head walking around.

1313
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,080
Yeah, no, that was me.

1314
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,160
I didn't realize that he starts moving.

1315
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,780
I didn't realize he starts moving.

1316
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,040
After I dropped him, I thought I could just put him there.

1317
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,220
Wait, let's grab him.

1318
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,900
Where is he?

1319
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,920
I don't have a cake, though.

1320
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,880
Oh, we need more cake.

1321
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,140
Yeah, yeah, we need more cake.

1322
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,680
No!

1323
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,320
Send me, send me, send me.

1324
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,280
Wash his head, wash his head.

1325
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,460
Oh, that's the cook!

1326
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,340
This is the cook!

1327
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,320
Yeah, yeah, we can attach.

1328
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,900
I'm just thinking when we attach them, do you think they'll run away because they're, like, vibrating?

1329
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,360
Oh, they're chained down.

1330
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,060
I got John Alpha Male over here.

1331
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,700
John Alpha Male?

1332
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,520
What does he look like?

1333
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,100
Wait, is that the groom?

1334
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,800
Yeah, yeah, that could be the groom.

1335
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,740
Ooh, she's gonna get excited.

1336
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,980
You're gonna be... let's make them kiss.

1337
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,520
Let's make a circle of heads.

1338
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,340
I like how girls can make heads.

1339
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,380
Alright, I'll hold my head, you hold your head, and maybe they can kiss.

1340
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,580
Make them kiss.

1341
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1342
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,300
Are they kissing?

1343
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,620
We're playing Barbie dolls.

1344
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,380
Yeah, we're playing Barbie dolls with the head.

1345
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,540
Oh, this one head over here is, like, gagging.

1346
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,700
Yeah, he's still... he's waiting for...

1347
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,560
He's pouting.

1348
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,560
He's, like, in the corner.

1349
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,600
We're chasing him back into the...

1350
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,480
No, stop!

1351
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:32,880
Go back!

1352
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,040
Go back!

1353
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,200
Go back!

1354
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,360
Nobody loves you!

1355
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,040
Go back!

1356
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,540
That's rude.

1357
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,040
Chase him back!

1358
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:40,740
Chase him back!

1359
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,960
Oh, he got out.

1360
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,800
He got out.

1361
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,540
Aw, man.

1362
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:44,940
One jump.

1363
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:45,900
Uh-oh.

1364
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,100
Uh-oh.

1365
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,080
Okay, I'm back here, I guess.

1366
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,260
Wait, is she in this world or the other?

1367
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,140
I can't tell.

1368
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,160
I'd never know.

1369
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,780
I'm just scared forever.

1370
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,380
I think she's...

1371
00:53:59,380 --> 00:53:59,800
Is it really loud?

1372
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,160
I think she's in the... I think she's in the inside world.

1373
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,300
I think she's in the real world.

1374
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:04,960
Where's Limu?

1375
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,620
Did she die?

1376
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,120
Oh, my God!

1377
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,880
That's so loud!

1378
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,390
Oh, my God!

1379
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,750
I'm sorry!

1380
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:28,950
Oh, my God!

1381
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,710
I'm so sorry!

1382
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,690
Let me turn this...

1383
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,530
I'm so sorry!

1384
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,190
Holy shit!

1385
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,990
Let me turn this out of it.

1386
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:42,670
Oh, no.

1387
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:44,430
Please.

1388
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,750
Please!

1389
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:47,490
Anybody help!

1390
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,110
She's in the other world!

1391
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:54,410
She's in the other world!

1392
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,670
In the other world?

1393
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,470
Yeah, she got me from behind.

1394
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,570
She got me...

1395
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,390
She got me from in the mirror.

1396
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,190
That's so sad for you.

1397
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:04,830
Bye.

1398
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,170
We're gonna run out of med kits.

1399
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:10,030
I'm scared.

1400
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:10,890
Oh, my God.

1401
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:15,890
I got the head.

1402
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:21,190
I was literally against the mirror and then she fucking jumped out from the mirror.

1403
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:23,630
I think it might be in the other world.

1404
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,050
Yeah, I know.

1405
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:24,930
I was right there.

1406
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,310
You watched it happen.

1407
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:28,570
Okay, I'm gonna put the head on her.

1408
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,050
I got one of them.

1409
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:35,790
I got her.

1410
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,050
Wow, she sounds a little...

1411
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:42,650
I think...

1412
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,130
What does she sound...

1413
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:50,170
I mean, at least she's having a good time.

1414
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:51,770
You didn't complain.

1415
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:53,510
Oh, nice.

1416
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:54,190
Oh, wait.

1417
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,250
You get closer to the body.

1418
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1419
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,230
As long as we bury them.

1420
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:01,790
Yeah, yeah.

1421
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:02,250
Okay.

1422
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,370
They're fine like that.

1423
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:04,870
Probably.

1424
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,490
We got five more cake.

1425
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,270
I'm gonna get more cake slices.

1426
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,430
Yeah, I'm gonna get alcohol then when you get cake slice.

1427
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:16,890
I got alcohol.

1428
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,790
There's more cake slices at the balcony.

1429
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,940
So much cake outside.

1430
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:25,900
Yeah, yeah.

1431
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,480
Wait, there's a...

1432
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:27,740
Wait, wait.

1433
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,180
We have a head, right?

1434
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,000
Wait, do you guys...

1435
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,640
Oh, you got one?

1436
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,940
I got the groom.

1437
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,540
Yeah, I was the groom.

1438
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,260
I wanna see him.

1439
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,180
Wait, I wanna see him.

1440
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,280
Is he here?

1441
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,660
Oh, there he is.

1442
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,160
Look at him.

1443
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,680
He doesn't say anything.

1444
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,040
Oh, he does.

1445
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,240
He's just very quiet.

1446
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,340
Yeah, he's just like...

1447
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,560
He's whimpering a little bit.

1448
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:49,680
Pussy.

1449
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,240
Whimper a little bit.

1450
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,520
Oh, I found more cake.

1451
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,880
Yeah, I have alcohol.

1452
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,620
Wait, we need that so we can get that guy.

1453
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1454
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,700
We gotta go to the other world.

1455
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,680
There's one on the table here.

1456
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:04,900
We gotta go to the...

1457
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,280
There's three slices in here, actually.

1458
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,800
I have a shovel in the other world.

1459
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,320
Yeah, yeah.

1460
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,240
There's a shovel right here, too.

1461
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,500
Oh, okay.

1462
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:12,860
That's good.

1463
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1464
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,420
We'll just wait.

1465
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,420
Yeah, yeah.

1466
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,280
We don't wanna aggro her.

1467
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:17,440
Yeah.

1468
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:18,600
Yeah, so...

1469
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,380
We should go to the other world.

1470
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,380
And feed some...

1471
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,220
Where's the one...

1472
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,420
Where's the head that's in here?

1473
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,380
Well, we have to go to the other world.

1474
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:26,860
It's over here, right?

1475
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,960
Yeah, this is the real world.

1476
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:28,880
He was here.

1477
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,780
No, he was in the real world.

1478
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:31,780
Wait, he was?

1479
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,100
How is he in the real world?

1480
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,580
How did you get here?

1481
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:34,940
Remember?

1482
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:35,640
We were just...

1483
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,580
Some of them were in the real world.

1484
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,120
Oh, okay.

1485
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,120
Someone feed him.

1486
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:38,940
I don't have it.

1487
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,240
I think we accidentally brought him here.

1488
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,560
And then when you dropped him down...

1489
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:42,920
Oh, yeah.

1490
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,800
I brought him here.

1491
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,320
Yeah.

1492
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,300
Oh, my God.

1493
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:46,760
Doki.

1494
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,460
I was the one that dropped him.

1495
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,540
That's my child.

1496
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,000
Okay,

1497
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,400
we have alcohol.

1498
00:57:59,340 --> 00:57:59,760
Oh, yeah.

1499
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,280
I have extra too.

1500
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,580
My early onset dementia.

1501
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,260
Look, I'm old right now.

1502
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,280
I'm playing an old guy.

1503
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,060
I'm just role-playing.

1504
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,720
I'm just role-playing as the old man.

1505
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,960
Look at him squirm.

1506
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,700
He's so cute.

1507
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,380
Wait, what does she do?

1508
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:19,200
Look, you can see your...

1509
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,220
Oh, I wonder if it was a bat.

1510
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,400
Or a crow.

1511
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,840
Yeah, I burned that crow.

1512
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,200
Okay, I'm refilling the...

1513
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,680
I have the lady in the backyard.

1514
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,560
I'm gonna go put her on.

1515
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,300
Alright, I'm gonna put more alcohol in here.

1516
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:33,740
Okay.

1517
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,480
Okay, I don't have a med kit though.

1518
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,420
Hi, Snuffy.

1519
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,220
What happened to you, son?

1520
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,920
He's like really groaning.

1521
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,540
Oh, shit, she's pissed.

1522
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,400
Oh, shit, is she in the other world?

1523
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,080
I can't tell.

1524
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,640
I can't tell.

1525
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,120
I can't tell, I'm just gonna follow you.

1526
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,560
I don't know where she is.

1527
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,620
Oh, it's her!

1528
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,620
It's the flower girl!

1529
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,100
Yeah, yeah, I got her.

1530
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:02,480
Yay!

1531
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,840
Alright, we gotta find a med kit for her.

1532
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:05,940
Yeah.

1533
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,600
I have another cake.

1534
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,480
I have cake.

1535
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,380
Is that alcohol?

1536
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:17,420
If she comes up to us, you can calm her down with UV.

1537
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1538
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,480
We'll just be like...

1539
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,940
Like, blue is a very common color.

1540
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,460
She's basically Bridezilla.

1541
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,400
She's upstairs?

1542
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,020
Alright.

1543
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,500
Women, am I right?

1544
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,880
Oh, women, am I right, son?

1545
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,360
Oh, look!

1546
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,800
She's no longer Bridezilla.

1547
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,780
Oh, there she is.

1548
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,740
She's like, still around, but she's not pissed.

1549
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,800
Guys, we need to get her a med kit.

1550
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:53,760
Guys!

1551
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,820
There you go, okay.

1552
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,430
We have two cakes for...

1553
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:13,530
Oh shit, there's a crow.

1554
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:18,930
We have two cakes for a head, so we gotta go to the other world.

1555
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,630
Yeah, let's go to the other world.

1556
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:24,630
There's one, the one that I was like, I tripped and fell is upstairs.

1557
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,970
You tripped and fell?

1558
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,530
Wait, there's a mirror here, there's a mirror here.

1559
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:29,010
She's in the ghost world, yeah.

1560
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:31,770
The head is in the ghost world, so it should be okay.

1561
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,650
Watch out for the...

1562
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,530
Yeah, I have extra cake as well.

1563
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:40,230
I figured, I think the ghosts like, regenerate the tentacle things.

1564
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:41,990
Or the heads.

1565
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,190
They like, feed them.

1566
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,090
I'm right here behind you, where is he?

1567
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:47,650
Oh, it's in this one.

1568
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,130
And he was in that one.

1569
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:50,970
Oh, he's here, he's here.

1570
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:51,310
Alright.

1571
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:52,930
Go eat your cake.

1572
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:54,230
Come on, boy.

1573
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:55,050
Come on.

1574
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:56,530
Yes, you want the cake?

1575
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:57,270
Oh, you do?

1576
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,550
Okay, fine!

1577
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:02,970
Fine, where is he?

1578
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:06,810
Did he run?

1579
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:07,770
There we go.

1580
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:08,770
Alright, let's do this.

1581
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:09,950
There you go.

1582
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,450
That's what happens when you complain.

1583
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,970
I'll turn the car around.

1584
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,310
You think I won't?

1585
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,370
I will turn the car around.

1586
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,330
Does anybody have a...

1587
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:23,070
Upstairs bathroom?

1588
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:24,050
Yeah, someone did.

1589
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,150
I think that was Min.

1590
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:27,310
Yeah, Min had it.

1591
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:29,010
Yeah, alright.

1592
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,010
I can hear her.

1593
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,050
Yeah, how do we get to the...

1594
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:33,230
We gotta go to the other side.

1595
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:35,290
Min, do you have the upstairs bathroom key?

1596
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:38,150
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we got it.

1597
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:38,750
It's up here.

1598
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:40,610
Right side, right side.

1599
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:41,310
No, no, no, right side.

1600
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:41,530
Right here.

1601
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:42,950
The door over here.

1602
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:43,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1603
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:44,630
Left, left, right here.

1604
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:46,010
Oh, yeah?

1605
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:47,930
Oh, you did.

1606
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:48,570
Oh, what?

1607
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,290
I remember you had an upstairs something.

1608
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:52,670
I have a...

1609
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:53,750
I have a head.

1610
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,210
I have the closet key.

1611
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:55,870
Oh, okay.

1612
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,510
I have cake, if we have a...

1613
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:58,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1614
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,570
Do we have another head?

1615
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:01,250
I have cake also.

1616
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,270
I have not seen one.

1617
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,870
How many have we had so far?

1618
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:07,570
Uh...

1619
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:10,330
I'm holding one right now, so...

1620
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:10,950
I'm gonna go to...

1621
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:12,950
I wanna go to the other world to clean this one, though.

1622
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,050
No head?

1623
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,570
Where did our head go?

1624
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:23,190
Alright.

1625
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,050
I feel like we should get two...

1626
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,090
One more, at least.

1627
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:29,870
Do you know...

1628
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,410
Wait, you know where the closet was, right?

1629
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:31,710
Did you?

1630
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:32,830
Yeah, it was at the bottom.

1631
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:34,270
The closet was at the bottom.

1632
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:35,670
The closet's down here.

1633
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:37,750
It's down here.

1634
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,870
Or did I?

1635
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,090
It's open on this side, but it might not be open on the other side.

1636
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:42,950
Oh yeah, the other world.

1637
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:43,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1638
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:44,490
Oh wait, I think I did.

1639
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:44,950
Nevermind.

1640
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,530
Oh, that's a bad word.

1641
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:50,430
Not if you're Australian!

1642
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:52,450
Oh, you two streamers demonetized.

1643
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:53,990
Not if you're Australian!

1644
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,430
I'm gonna go wash the head.

1645
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,650
Oh, I hear her bashing her head.

1646
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,670
Guys, for one day, I shall be Australian.

1647
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,130
It's okay, guys.

1648
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,150
I can say that technically I'm in Australia right now.

1649
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,570
Whose head is this?

1650
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,430
Oh, it's the girl with red hair.

1651
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:24,850
Okay.

1652
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:32,610
I wonder whose head she belongs to.

1653
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,180
Wait.

1654
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,200
Guys, guys, guys!

1655
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,480
Guys, are you in the other world?

1656
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:46,940
No.

1657
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,360
Guys, come over here.

1658
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,140
The crows take the heads!

1659
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,160
The crows take the heads if we don't bury them.

1660
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,220
Oh my god, no way!

1661
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:57,940
Oh my god.

1662
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,040
What?

1663
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,240
The crows take it.

1664
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,600
The crows take the head if you don't bury them.

1665
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,260
Oh, well that makes sense.

1666
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:08,140
Wait, do you think there would be crows taking the head at the altar then?

1667
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:08,920
Maybe we should just...

1668
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,520
Just like stockpile heads at the altar.

1669
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,940
It's really easy to calm her down, so we just calm her down.

1670
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,240
Yeah, let's calm her down.

1671
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,100
Wait, that just lifted up.

1672
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,040
Yeah, she did that earlier.

1673
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:23,120
Oh, really?

1674
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,300
Okay, let's calm her then.

1675
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,080
Where is she?

1676
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,040
Oh no.

1677
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,400
Here she is.

1678
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,120
Calm down, girl.

1679
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,420
Calm down.

1680
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,760
The wedding will be okay.

1681
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,280
Let's just bury the heads and calm her down.

1682
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,820
The wedding will be okay, lady.

1683
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,520
Don't worry.

1684
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:47,380
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1685
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,200
So this isn't concerning you, leave.

1686
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,380
Okay, let's put the head.

1687
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,280
Wait, does that...

1688
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,020
Okay, the crow hasn't taken that head yet.

1689
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,980
I have two bodies here.

1690
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,040
I'm gonna go bury them.

1691
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,980
I'm gonna grab the shovel on the other side.

1692
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,140
What was that?

1693
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:13,760
Oh, who was that?

1694
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,240
Wait.

1695
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,320
Oh, you blind buried them.

1696
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,100
Oh, you buried them.

1697
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:20,580
Okay, okay.

1698
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,420
Oh my god.

1699
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,720
Oh my god, we have two more.

1700
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,380
Yeah, she seems not happy.

1701
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,880
Alright, are you guys ready to bury more?

1702
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,500
Alright, I'm gonna...

1703
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,760
Wait, did she say I'll get you?

1704
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,460
Alright, let's make her angrier.

1705
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,720
Let's make her angrier.

1706
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,920
Let's make her ang...

1707
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,440
Oh.

1708
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,520
Wait, what?

1709
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,000
Oh.

1710
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,920
Okay, so we made her angrier.

1711
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,440
Alright, let's just stockpile heads then.

1712
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,480
We'll stockpile heads.

1713
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,100
Wait, where did Snuffy go?

1714
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:05,980
I can heal her.

1715
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,940
I think she's in the other world.

1716
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,320
I think I pissed her off that time.

1717
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,160
I think it's supposed to get harder as the game goes on.

1718
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,260
Oh, no, it is, it is.

1719
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,960
That's how devour works, yeah.

1720
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,000
The more heads we're returning, the more power she unlocks for some reason because she pissed.

1721
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,540
We have to go to the other world!

1722
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,460
Okay, let's stockpile heads in the altar.

1723
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,660
Let's stockpile heads...

1724
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:24,720
Can you pick up this head?

1725
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,820
And we'll put all the heads in the altar and then we'll start...

1726
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:29,840
And then we'll...

1727
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,460
There's no way the crows will head to the altar.

1728
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:32,620
There's no way.

1729
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,580
It's our safe place.

1730
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,620
Yeah, the crows can't go in because there's God on our side.

1731
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,220
I thought you loved Satan.

1732
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,820
I love Satan.

1733
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,460
You don't love God, you love Satan.

1734
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,360
Wait, who took the other head that went...

1735
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,080
Oh, you have it?

1736
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,220
No, Lime has it.

1737
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:54,420
Oh, okay, okay.

1738
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,160
Yeah, I think she went to the altar.

1739
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,580
I think she went to stockpile it.

1740
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,940
I see Snuffy, I'm gonna go heal her.

1741
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,220
Alright, I'm gonna go to the crypt and...

1742
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,500
Put more alchohol.

1743
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:07,960
Are you okay?

1744
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,660
You're just standing there.

1745
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,220
I was just like...

1746
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:14,280
Yeah, I was just slightly possessed by the tiredness demon.

1747
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,680
Yeah, I was like, oh my God, that's a little freaky.

1748
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,420
There's no way there's gonna be crows here.

1749
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,960
A crow does kinda spawn in here for what it's worth.

1750
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,040
Okay, we'll hide it.

1751
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,340
We'll hide the head.

1752
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,940
There's no way they'll find the head here.

1753
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,100
Our little stockpile of heads.

1754
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,680
Oh, I see Snuffy.

1755
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,300
Oh, I think they...

1756
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,440
I think...

1757
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,940
Oh, she mad already.

1758
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:42,620
There's no way she'll be on here, this side, right?

1759
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,220
This is our safe spot.

1760
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,340
I think she came in here before.

1761
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:46,740
Wait, she did?

1762
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,040
She came like halfway down the tunnel, yeah.

1763
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:50,940
Oh, shit.

1764
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,260
Oh, yeah, when she was chasing Mintonite, she came all the way in.

1765
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:54,680
Oh, you're alive!

1766
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,300
Hey guys, I'm back alive again.

1767
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,260
How did you die?

1768
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,640
How did you die?

1769
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,060
She was like, I'm gonna get you guys again.

1770
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,720
She's like, oh, you guys win.

1771
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:07,980
Just kidding.

1772
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,900
Yeah, she was classified, and then she went, haha, that's a joke.

1773
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,160
And actually just murdered Snuffy.

1774
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,140
Yeah, I think it only stuns her now.

1775
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:17,920
It doesn't like actually...

1776
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,800
Yeah, yeah, alright.

1777
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,440
So now, we'll stockpile all the heads in this corner.

1778
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,200
So we'll be fine.

1779
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:25,920
Alright, we just need to find more heads.

1780
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,720
I have not seen five heads.

1781
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,680
There's no way.

1782
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,460
Unless they're all trapped in the bathroom.

1783
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,640
They're all just trapped in one bathroom.

1784
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:36,780
Seriously?

1785
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:37,720
Actually, no.

1786
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,580
Does anybody have any cake?

1787
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,480
Okay, you're not safe in the other world.

1788
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,640
Oh, somebody said red eyes can't be stunned.

1789
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,100
She will have red eyes.

1790
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,640
Okay, okay.

1791
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,400
Red eyes can't be stunned.

1792
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,680
The lore, the...

1793
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,860
Yeah, that's when you know she's extra Bridezilla.

1794
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,040
Should we go into the other world?

1795
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,400
Oh, I think that's her.

1796
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,300
Is she... that's her outside?

1797
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:04,900
I think that's her outside.

1798
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,640
The red eyes black tribe.

1799
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,280
Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine.

1800
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,300
Oh, shine, shine, shine, shine.

1801
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,340
We got you, we got you.

1802
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,220
Where did that head come from?

1803
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,080
Wow, they're all multiplying.

1804
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:23,660
Does anybody have cake?

1805
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,140
Oh, I thought you guys had cake.

1806
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,240
I don't have cake.

1807
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,340
Okay, I'm gonna go to the other world.

1808
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,340
Okay, time to find cake.

1809
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,840
I found alcohol.

1810
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,460
You found some?

1811
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,800
No, I found alcohol.

1812
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,760
Did I just hear her?

1813
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:42,880
Wait.

1814
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,020
Oh, they got the... they got this head.

1815
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,380
They got this head.

1816
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,360
I'll take it to the altar.

1817
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,080
I'll take it to the altar.

1818
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,700
Was that the head from the altar?

1819
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:52,680
No, no.

1820
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,860
This is not the one from the altar.

1821
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:54,140
Oh, okay.

1822
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,480
It better not be.

1823
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,960
Wait, they can't come in here though, don't you?

1824
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,300
We've zapped them from in here before.

1825
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,240
But this is a different head, but they can definitely come in here.

1826
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,440
Yeah, yeah.

1827
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,080
No, but there's no way they can find it.

1828
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:10,760
There's no way.

1829
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:11,800
It's in our corner.

1830
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,920
It's our safe space corner.

1831
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,440
It's our safe space, yeah.

1832
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:17,780
Okay.

1833
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,480
Alright, we gotta find...

1834
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:23,420
Wait, what the f... Oh my God, fuck off!

1835
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,960
It's literally you.

1836
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,780
And I know what I'm like.

1837
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,220
Yeah, we all do.

1838
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,760
It can only be one.

1839
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,560
One is already too many.

1840
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,820
Oh yeah, cake.

1841
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,120
Nice.

1842
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:45,940
I found cake too.

1843
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,140
I found... There's three cakes here.

1844
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:47,960
There's three cakes here.

1845
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,140
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1846
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,020
Let's get the head.

1847
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:54,660
Let's get the head.

1848
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,100
Let's get the head.

1849
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:56,640
Head time.

1850
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:57,760
Get the head.

1851
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:58,560
Where is it?

1852
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,100
I'm heading to the other side.

1853
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,520
Where's the... Where's the heads?

1854
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:11,680
Oh, she's downstairs.

1855
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:12,040
She's downstairs.

1856
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:12,480
She's downstairs.

1857
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:12,940
She's downstairs.

1858
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,400
She's bashing her head again.

1859
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,420
Look at her go.

1860
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,040
Don't worry, ma'am.

1861
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,040
We'll save your wedding.

1862
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,100
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1863
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,620
If you don't want your wedding to be saved, that's...

1864
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,020
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1865
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,140
She wants to kill us.

1866
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,680
She wants...

1867
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,220
She really wants to kill us.

1868
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,060
What do we do?

1869
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:37,440
What do we do?

1870
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,900
She really wants to kill us.

1871
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,680
What do...

1872
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,200
Oh, where is she?

1873
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:43,720
Is she... Is she here with us?

1874
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,600
I can't tell.

1875
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,080
We're good.

1876
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:48,300
We're good.

1877
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:48,740
We're running.

1878
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I got another head.

1879
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:50,860
Oh, nice, nice.

1880
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:51,680
I got a...

1881
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,760
I also got cake too for this head.

1882
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,760
I'm gonna head over here.

1883
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:04,110
Where's... Where's the other head?

1884
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,990
I thought you guys said there wasn't a head here.

1885
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:08,510
Oh, there's a head.

1886
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:09,190
Come over here.

1887
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:09,850
Come on, boy.

1888
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,950
Which... Which cake... Which...

1889
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:18,990
Okay, I'll put this cake in the... I'll put this cake in the altar.

1890
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,070
Okay, we found... We have another head with us.

1891
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,750
We have another head.

1892
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:25,130
I'm putting this cake downstairs.

1893
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:36,580
I can confirm a crow just showed up in here and stole one of the heads.

1894
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,540
I killed it, but they will steal the heads in here.

1895
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:39,060
No!

1896
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,340
No, okay, but, like, you can't steal all the heads.

1897
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,480
As long as we come back...

1898
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,380
Wait, Sophie died.

1899
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,380
Yeah, I got you.

1900
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,260
Wait, no, no, wait.

1901
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,060
Wait, Mint died.

1902
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:49,780
Mint died.

1903
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:53,700
It's okay.

1904
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,640
As long as there's one of us guarding the heads, we should be fine.

1905
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,360
You can't have all... All the crows can't be here.

1906
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,700
I don't trust myself to maneuver.

1907
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,900
I've... I've died enough.

1908
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,460
I can make friends with the heads.

1909
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:09,740
Sure.

1910
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,460
Okay, put them in that corner.

1911
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,140
Okay, how many more do we need total?

1912
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,120
We need... I think, like, two more.

1913
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:20,620
I don't remember.

1914
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:21,920
There were so many bodies.

1915
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,000
Maybe three more.

1916
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,260
There's so many guys.

1917
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,140
Okay, I'm gonna put this in here.

1918
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:31,700
Oh, she's mad.

1919
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:36,410
Oh.

1920
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:38,370
Sophie, are you okay?

1921
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:41,670
Sophie, are you okay?

1922
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:42,490
What happened?

1923
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:56,350
Wait, I think she's trying to... I think she's fighting off... Is that the bride?

1924
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:58,990
Is that the bride?

1925
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,250
Oh, she's so angry!

1926
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,150
No!

1927
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:10,670
Oh my god.

1928
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:13,770
We got her, we got her, we got her, we got her, we got her, we got her.

1929
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,550
Okay, she's calm, it's calm.

1930
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:18,970
We gotta grab that medkit.

1931
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:19,490
Mint!

1932
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:21,990
Mint, we're coming!

1933
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:26,830
We don't have a medkit, I have a cake, though!

1934
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:28,610
It's almost like a medkit!

1935
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,530
Ow, stop!

1936
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:40,190
Where's the medkit?

1937
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:42,230
Where's the medkit, Mint?

1938
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:44,550
Wait, there's a medkit in here!

1939
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,010
It's right here, it's right here.

1940
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:53,750
There's lots of cake and stuff in here, too.

1941
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,230
There you go, I got you.

1942
01:14:58,950 --> 01:14:59,450
That's good.

1943
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:00,730
Alright.

1944
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:05,430
Someone in my chat said we'll have to stun her multiple times now to calm her down.

1945
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:06,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1946
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:08,430
I have more cake as well.

1947
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:10,950
Check the bodies for the bathroom key, bro.

1948
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:11,950
How do we open this door?

1949
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:16,870
Oh, she's right there.

1950
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:20,970
What's going on?

1951
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,090
What's going on?

1952
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,090
Wait, wait.

1953
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,470
Guys!

1954
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,390
Guys, she's right there!

1955
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,100
Oh, no.

1956
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:52,460
Oh, no.

1957
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,120
Oh, no.

1958
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,500
No, please don't come in here.

1959
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,080
Oh, she's just outside my door!

1960
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:03,930
You go around her?

1961
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:09,250
Oh, god.

1962
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:09,990
Oh, god.

1963
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:11,330
Oh, god, I can't.

1964
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,690
Oh, god, I can't!

1965
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,110
Get away, get away!

1966
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,590
Where are the cakes?

1967
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:22,970
Oh, we did it.

1968
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,410
We did it.

1969
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,230
We made it through.

1970
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,830
We made it through.

1971
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,450
Get away from our heads.

1972
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:29,710
Get away from our heads!

1973
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,110
Okay, our heads are still here.

1974
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:35,110
They're all still here.

1975
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:35,650
That's good.

1976
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:37,530
We had four, right?

1977
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:38,670
I can't remember.

1978
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:40,770
Wish we had so many.

1979
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:43,650
I can't remember if we had four.

1980
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,110
There's been so many.

1981
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,790
There's been so many.

1982
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:49,390
Okay, four.

1983
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:50,010
Okay, nice.

1984
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:53,010
Okay.

1985
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,390
Hello?

1986
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,450
Hello, everybody?

1987
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:02,980
Hello?

1988
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:15,010
I'm split up from everybody.

1989
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:22,710
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1990
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,780
Oh, there you guys are!

1991
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:32,620
Are you guys being chased?

1992
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,800
Are you guys being chased?

1993
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,520
There was no input on whether or not you guys were being chased.

1994
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:38,660
Yeah, yeah.

1995
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,120
I think she's gonna come out.

1996
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,180
Oh, she came out!

1997
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,180
She came out the other side!

1998
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,320
Her eyes aren't red anymore.

1999
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:46,940
You can stun her.

2000
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:47,460
Okay.

2001
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:47,920
Where is she?

2002
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:48,980
She's like in front.

2003
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:49,580
She's in front.

2004
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,560
Have you guys seen any more heads?

2005
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,060
I don't know where she is.

2006
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:00,260
No, I'm wondering if the spawns are stuck behind actually burying bodies.

2007
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,940
I think she's stupid.

2008
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,040
Oh, there she is.

2009
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,660
Oh, so like we have to... they spawn after?

2010
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,760
Oh, we got her, we got her, we got her.

2011
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,380
Okay, so like if they stop spawning, we might as well start burying.

2012
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,360
Okay, let's bury them.

2013
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,900
Alright, I'll put some cake down.

2014
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:18,400
That might not be true, but there's nothing in the other world right now.

2015
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:18,660
Alright.

2016
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,920
Alright, all three of us, let's go!

2017
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,560
We just need to get three heads on.

2018
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,640
Alright, I got one.

2019
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,340
I get this dude.

2020
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:34,500
We got three heads and then let's bring... and then we can get Snuffy to bring a shovel.

2021
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,440
Okay, where's Snuffy?

2022
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,000
Wait, where is Snuffy?

2023
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,120
What head do I even have on?

2024
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,760
Okay, I don't know...

2025
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,200
I think I have the gardener.

2026
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,180
I have the gardener.

2027
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,580
I don't know where this lady goes, but I'll figure it out.

2028
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,120
Snuffy!

2029
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,200
Snuffy!

2030
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,080
Okay, okay.

2031
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:55,780
Snuffy!

2032
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:57,080
We have a shovel.

2033
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:57,780
I have a shovel here.

2034
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,720
I know where it is.

2035
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,000
Here, here, here.

2036
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:01,620
This is a shovel.

2037
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:02,720
Right here.

2038
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:05,800
Snuffy, you're a shovel duty.

2039
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,040
Okay, let's find the head.

2040
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:11,460
Mine's a gardener head.

2041
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:14,980
Oh no, I found it.

2042
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:15,240
I got one.

2043
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:15,740
I got one here.

2044
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:17,900
Bury time.

2045
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:19,920
Do your thing, son.

2046
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:21,580
Remember what I taught you, boy.

2047
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:25,300
Remember what I taught you.

2048
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,340
You're gonna dig those holes.

2049
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,160
I'm so proud of you, son.

2050
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,640
Snuffy's over here.

2051
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:36,840
Wait, what's this, guys?

2052
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,000
Wait.

2053
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:37,700
What?

2054
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,060
What is it?

2055
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,120
What's that?

2056
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:39,740
Oh, it's a key!

2057
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:40,960
Oh, there it is!

2058
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,360
Oh, um...

2059
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:43,800
Uh-oh.

2060
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,460
I got out you all.

2061
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:47,740
Oh, God.

2062
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:48,400
Oh, God.

2063
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:48,700
Right here.

2064
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:48,960
Burry.

2065
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:49,680
Just bury this guy.

2066
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:50,860
Where did you put your head?

2067
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:52,700
There's a...

2068
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:53,460
He needs to be buried.

2069
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,920
Snuffy, get over here.

2070
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:55,200
Snuffy!

2071
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,740
Get over here.

2072
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,420
Bury her.

2073
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,420
Right there, right there, right there.

2074
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,400
We'll protect you.

2075
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,540
We'll protect you.

2076
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,400
Something's attacking me.

2077
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,560
There's birds attacking me.

2078
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,880
There's birds attacking me.

2079
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,240
Oh, she took the head!

2080
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:26,050
I'm sorry.

2081
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:27,750
I'm so sorry.

2082
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:29,830
We're gonna...

2083
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,790
I'm so...

2084
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,330
We're so sorry.

2085
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:41,110
I'm so sorry.

2086
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,210
I'm so sorry.

2087
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:51,070
No, I'm so sorry.

2088
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:57,790
Son!

2089
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,190
Son, pick me back up!

2090
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:02,670
Son!

2091
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:05,730
Thank you, son.

2092
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:07,430
Oh, my God.

2093
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,670
I knew you got this, boy.

2094
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:12,870
I knew you were there for me, boy.

2095
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:23,990
Bro, okay.

2096
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:25,670
We can finally bury...

2097
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,510
What the fuck are you laughing about?

2098
01:21:34,450 --> 01:21:35,150
That's the girl!

2099
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:36,230
That's the girl from before!

2100
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:39,850
Hold on to it.

2101
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:41,390
Hold on to it for now.

2102
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,290
Oh, we have the other head.

2103
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:44,230
Come with me.

2104
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:45,430
Come with me.

2105
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:46,710
Come with me, Snuffy.

2106
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:48,630
Okay.

2107
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:51,790
No, she's not.

2108
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:55,650
We gotta... Come in here, right here.

2109
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:56,130
Just hurry!

2110
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:57,370
Just...

2111
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:00,290
Flashlight battery, guys.

2112
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:01,030
Flashlight battery.

2113
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:01,430
Watch out.

2114
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:01,730
Watch out.

2115
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:02,790
I have a battery.

2116
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:03,890
There's a battery right here.

2117
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:04,950
There's a battery right in front of you.

2118
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:05,410
Run!

2119
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:06,590
Run, Ike.

2120
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:06,810
Run!

2121
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:07,330
I won it.

2122
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,230
Famous last words.

2123
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:15,210
She was like, I won it.

2124
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:17,950
No, it didn't break!

2125
01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:23,370
I tried so hard to warn her.

2126
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,750
She was like, I won it.

2127
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:26,430
Do you have the shovel?

2128
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,610
I have it.

2129
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:27,930
I have it.

2130
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:28,970
Okay, there we go.

2131
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:32,230
Where am I getting beat up?

2132
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:34,070
Oh, there he is.

2133
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:37,050
I'll go save Snuffy.

2134
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:39,050
Why are you attacking me?

2135
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:42,030
Who's laughing?

2136
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,930
Oh, I think that's us.

2137
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:44,330
Yeah.

2138
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:46,750
Oh, wait.

2139
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:48,750
No, that's my character celebrating because she's a freak.

2140
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:50,230
She's here.

2141
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:50,650
She's here.

2142
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:51,190
She's here.

2143
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:51,990
Oh, God.

2144
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:53,170
Oh, God.

2145
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:53,410
Oh, my God.

2146
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:53,850
She's here.

2147
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:54,370
She's mad.

2148
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,010
Oh, my God.

2149
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,460
Give me.

2150
01:22:59,560 --> 01:22:59,860
Give me.

2151
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,180
Drop it.

2152
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:04,440
Are you?

2153
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,020
Get away from me!

2154
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,640
Oh, there's my son over there.

2155
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,060
There he is.

2156
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,100
There's my boy.

2157
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,060
We have four more to go.

2158
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:15,940
Oh, God.

2159
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:20,340
Yeah, we could just put this here then until...

2160
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:20,620
Yeah.

2161
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,460
No, but then she's going to get stronger.

2162
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:26,140
So, we might as well just put that here for now until we have three more heads.

2163
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,820
Oh, no.

2164
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:28,960
She is definitely stronger.

2165
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:33,440
Okay, we got to get our boy.

2166
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:37,980
Oh, okay.

2167
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,020
Boy!

2168
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:40,800
My boy!

2169
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,440
My boy!

2170
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,520
Don't worry.

2171
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,740
Your daddies are here.

2172
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,320
It's not aggro now.

2173
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,040
Like father, like son.

2174
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,280
I'm so proud of her.

2175
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,300
Oh,

2176
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,020
my God.

2177
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,250
I was saying...

2178
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,940
I have this.

2179
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,860
Do we want to go bury it?

2180
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:49,040
I think we got it.

2181
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:49,480
We got it.

2182
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,640
Like, no, just put it here until we get two more heads.

2183
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,720
So, then we can do the three heads thing, strat again.

2184
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,820
Okay, okay, okay.

2185
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,840
She's definitely in that tunnel.

2186
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:02,420
She's definitely in that tunnel.

2187
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,260
Oh, she's coming.

2188
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,620
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

2189
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,480
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

2190
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,500
She just said next time, fucker.

2191
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,220
She's still coming.

2192
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:20,940
Go to the other world.

2193
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,840
Walk around.

2194
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,540
Where's the medkits?

2195
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,220
Oh, no, not another one.

2196
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:45,450
I'm trying to find more medkits.

2197
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:49,770
Nowhere is safe.

2198
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:51,970
Wait a minute, that's two dead bodies.

2199
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,230
I have medkit, I have medkit.

2200
01:25:57,230 --> 01:26:01,090
Come to me, children, I have medkit.

2201
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,110
Who's more?

2202
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:04,830
Okay.

2203
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:11,450
Oh, shit.

2204
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:14,470
Oh, my

2205
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:21,320
God, they harder.

2206
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,000
I'm sorry, I had to choose.

2207
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:30,300
I had to choose the child that was most resourceful.

2208
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:32,700
Um...

2209
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,140
What was that?

2210
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,240
What was that sound?

2211
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,440
Get to the other world, get to the other world.

2212
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:43,500
I'm sorry.

2213
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,620
We get dead again.

2214
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,000
This is bullshit.

2215
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,020
Oh, no.

2216
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,300
Oh, no.

2217
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,680
Oh, no.

2218
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,560
You were supposed to be the chosen child.

2219
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:55,940
Are you okay?

2220
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,000
I found a head, I found a head, I found a head.

2221
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,600
Oh, my God, I found a head.

2222
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,680
Do healing items not spawn back?

2223
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:15,900
Oh, you found a head?

2224
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:16,940
Yeah, yeah, I found...

2225
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,620
We found a head.

2226
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,880
What are you talking about?

2227
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,400
I was literally right in front of it.

2228
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,240
I was trying to find a cake.

2229
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,560
Oh, my God.

2230
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:27,440
You...

2231
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2232
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,360
I didn't mean any of that.

2233
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,180
I didn't mean any of that.

2234
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,120
I'm just a little grouchy.

2235
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,540
I'm just a little grouchy right now.

2236
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:32,920
I found a head.

2237
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:33,960
I found a head, I found a head.

2238
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:38,410
I'm dead.

2239
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:38,750
Goodbye.

2240
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:39,430
Goodbye.

2241
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:40,010
Goodbye.

2242
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:44,970
It's up to me.

2243
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:50,970
Oh, no.

2244
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:52,490
Medkits...

2245
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:55,310
Medkits don't respawn.

2246
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,230
What are you doing?

2247
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:58,850
What are you doing?

2248
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:02,990
It's up...

2249
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:05,530
It's up to you, mid.

2250
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,610
We're all dead.

2251
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:11,990
We're all dead now.

2252
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:16,250
It's up to you.

2253
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:20,710
You got this.

2254
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:25,650
We're gonna block your path.

2255
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,530
We're gonna block...

2256
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:34,380
We'll block her from killing you.

2257
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,400
We'll form a human shield.

2258
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:53,280
You walked into her.

2259
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:54,540
What are you...

2260
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,360
Oh, there's our dead bodies, guys.

2261
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,020
There it is.

2262
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:11,280
We got devoured.

2263
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,140
Guys, we kind of got bodied.

2264
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,280
Oh, my God.

2265
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:24,340
Oh, my God.

2266
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:25,960
I'm so sorry.

2267
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,080
We didn't survive.

2268
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,880
Holy shit.

2269
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:47,280
I'm gonna turn off player collision.

2270
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,100
No, I'm keeping player collision.

2271
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:52,680
I'm turning off batteries and I'm turning off medkits.

2272
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:54,140
Wait.

2273
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:58,680
No, I think turning off batteries is bad because, like, our flashlight is still refilled.

2274
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,200
But the batteries added more to it.

2275
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:03,120
So, turning off batteries would be worse.

2276
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,440
Oh, okay.

2277
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,940
What medkit means, like, we don't have any meds at all?

2278
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,300
Yeah, no, you want to keep those on.

2279
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:12,200
Oh, okay, so everything is the same.

2280
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,080
Alright, we can make it easier, by the way.

2281
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:15,780
Okay.

2282
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,300
We can make it.

2283
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,660
I think I get it, right?

2284
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,060
I think I get the hang of it now.

2285
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,400
You got it, right?

2286
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,420
You figured it out, boy.

2287
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:24,800
We have the system now.

2288
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we figured it out.

2289
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,640
It just took a long time.

2290
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:33,720
It just took multiple medkits.

2291
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,040
Okay, alright guys, ready up.

2292
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,540
I believe in us.

2293
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,180
I'm so sorry.

2294
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:53,880
I know this is way late, guys, but how is the audio?

2295
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,300
I feel like I'm too loud, but don't think that I need to be louder.

2296
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,880
I don't think they realized they could skip the cutscene.

2297
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,150
So we can hear...

2298
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:09,360
I can just hear Mint talking to herself in the other room.

2299
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,620
Stuck in cutscene verse.

2300
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,380
Mint, you can hit escape to skip the cutscene.

2301
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:18,180
She can't hear, she has her AirPods on.

2302
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:21,180
She has her AirPods on.

2303
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:22,640
Press escape.

2304
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:24,500
Hello?

2305
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,000
Hello?

2306
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:25,020
Hello?

2307
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:40,460
Hey guys, I like how you guys watched the entire cutscene so we could hear you guys talk in the other world.

2308
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,880
You were like, mushy mushy.

2309
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,260
I like to be immersed.

2310
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:48,840
I like to sympathize with the ghost.

2311
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,580
It's on the same level as the game.

2312
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:56,200
I know this has been late game, but is the volume okay, guys?

2313
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,540
Your audio is all fucked, Doki.

2314
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:04,800
That's why I'm asking.

2315
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:07,960
Yeah, yeah, you can mute the jump.

2316
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:08,760
I turned it off.

2317
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:09,980
It was so loud.

2318
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,140
It was so loud.

2319
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:11,980
Don't feel bad about it.

2320
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:14,860
Alright, we figured out the system, guys.

2321
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,420
Let's...

2322
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:23,080
Let's get ready to do the fastest fucking run of our lives.

2323
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:24,260
Yeah.

2324
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:26,760
We gotta make sure we grab all the keys, though.

2325
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,260
Wasn't there... this one spawned here.

2326
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,260
It wasn't here originally.

2327
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,800
Maybe... yeah, maybe it's different.

2328
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:37,520
Maybe, like, it spawns more when we grab more keys.

2329
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,820
Or grab more heads.

2330
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:44,850
What?

2331
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:47,990
Wait, the people?

2332
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:49,290
The bodies?

2333
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:51,650
Oh, you're right.

2334
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:52,750
That's not where the chef is.

2335
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:55,070
Oh, no.

2336
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:55,990
That's the lady.

2337
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:57,430
That's the disco lady.

2338
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:03,760
Okay, that's the groom.

2339
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:05,540
Okay, the groom's over here.

2340
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,620
The groom's back there.

2341
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,460
Flower girl.

2342
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,460
Okay, red dress.

2343
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,580
Alright, I'm ready.

2344
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:18,600
Are you guys ready?

2345
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,540
I'm so ready.

2346
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,940
I believe in us.

2347
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,380
Did we pour alcohol in there already?

2348
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:28,140
Okay, you're pouring.

2349
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,280
Alright, alright.

2350
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,400
Not yet, until we start it.

2351
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,800
Until you open... remember when you opened that door?

2352
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,180
That's when it starts, man.

2353
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:38,700
That's when...

2354
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,140
Remember that first door you opened and then the lady started coming out?

2355
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:44,960
Yeah, then I'll do it again.

2356
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,140
This is why...

2357
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,440
This is why we all die.

2358
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:57,200
I think the moment we spawn the bride, the doors can be opened.

2359
01:33:58,860 --> 01:33:59,620
I'm pretty sure.

2360
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:00,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2361
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:03,340
We can't open anything, so we gotta go to the other world.

2362
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:07,920
Don't worry, boy.

2363
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:08,540
I got you.

2364
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:09,860
I got you, boy.

2365
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:11,860
Alright, let's go.

2366
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,120
Where was the lady that you saw?

2367
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,540
It has to be the same one, right?

2368
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:24,500
Like, the same door?

2369
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,240
Oh, there she is.

2370
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,000
Through this door, right?

2371
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:29,940
Yeah, it was through this door.

2372
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,060
Yeah, yeah, son.

2373
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:32,580
It's time.

2374
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,400
It's time to meet that woman again.

2375
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,620
Wait, I did this before, Ned.

2376
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,980
It's time to meet her again.

2377
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:40,820
Yeah, alright, daughter.

2378
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,500
You ready for your woman time?

2379
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:45,460
I'm not even fucking streaming!

2380
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:49,620
It's time to be a woman.

2381
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,720
Oh, that's what it feels like.

2382
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,980
Yeah, I get jump scared.

2383
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,540
You guys just have the lights turned on.

2384
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,700
We gotta get keys now.

2385
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:02,600
We gotta get keys.

2386
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,980
Keys and heads.

2387
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:05,920
Keys and heads.

2388
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,020
The strats.

2389
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,080
Keys and heads.

2390
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,540
Maybe the key will... Maybe the key is found outside.

2391
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:14,720
Because...

2392
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,260
Oh, true!

2393
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:16,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2394
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,260
When we picked it up.

2395
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:19,960
Oh, there she is.

2396
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:24,440
Alright, I got a cake.

2397
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,120
Nice.

2398
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,340
Okay, we need children's bedroom.

2399
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,380
There's more head cake here.

2400
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:35,700
Oh, hey, there's a bathroom we unlocked.

2401
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,860
Oh, I got another... I got a painting room.

2402
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,800
Oh, not painting room.

2403
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:41,320
That's a place we haven't even seen before.

2404
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:43,100
No, we have.

2405
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,820
I've seen the painting room right now.

2406
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:46,400
I got painting room key.

2407
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:47,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2408
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:54,040
Okay, I need to open the painting room, though.

2409
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,120
I know.

2410
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,100
I saw it.

2411
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,360
I was literally just there.

2412
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:58,940
How do we get there?

2413
01:35:58,980 --> 01:35:59,320
I don't remember.

2414
01:35:59,320 --> 01:35:59,580
I don't remember.

2415
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,920
We got the dining room.

2416
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:09,600
It's like back here, right?

2417
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:11,260
Here, here, here, here.

2418
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2419
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:13,340
Maybe we'll find a head.

2420
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:14,260
No heads?

2421
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,040
Head, head, head!

2422
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:17,840
Pick it up, pick it up!

2423
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:19,700
Come on, little boy.

2424
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:20,720
Come on.

2425
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:21,820
Come on, little guy.

2426
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:22,540
Come on, little guy.

2427
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:22,900
Come on.

2428
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:24,000
Come on.

2429
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,640
Alright, nice.

2430
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,120
We got one.

2431
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:31,400
Alright, now I'll bring the head over to get cleansed.

2432
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,280
Oh, if he doesn't eat it!

2433
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:36,820
If he doesn't finish his job!

2434
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,280
I'm gonna go clean it.

2435
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:42,300
I'm cleaning the head.

2436
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:43,400
Okay,

2437
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:48,380
we're okay.

2438
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,960
I'm just gonna clean the head first.

2439
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:55,220
That's fine.

2440
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,000
She's not aggro.

2441
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:56,980
She's like calm.

2442
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,340
Oh, he's looking at me.

2443
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:01,580
He's fucking looking.

2444
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,140
That's right.

2445
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:03,900
Clean.

2446
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:05,280
Get cleaned.

2447
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,900
Get cleaned.

2448
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,800
That's right.

2449
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,160
Wait, I wonder if we don't do the...

2450
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:14,440
Wait.

2451
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,160
Oh, no.

2452
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:17,760
He...

2453
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,160
He's angry.

2454
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,240
Okay, never mind.

2455
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,740
I was gonna say...

2456
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:23,800
Like, if we don't start... Oh, there's the chef.

2457
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,880
If we don't start...

2458
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:28,580
Like, burying heads on the first one...

2459
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:30,900
Then, like, I'm thinking, like...

2460
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:31,960
Maybe, like...

2461
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,900
The crows won't come to get the heads.

2462
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,820
But then... No, the crow can still be killed.

2463
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:41,700
He was looking at that head.

2464
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,860
He was looking at it.

2465
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,540
It was, like, so juicy for him.

2466
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,520
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2467
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:54,840
Oh, cleanse, cleanse, cleanse.

2468
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:55,820
Yeah.

2469
01:37:58,600 --> 01:37:59,140
That's fine.

2470
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,620
The birds aren't super aggro.

2471
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,220
They're not super aggro, so we're fine.

2472
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:06,560
It's only at the...

2473
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,060
After the...

2474
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:10,400
After, like, we do more heads...

2475
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,600
It starts getting weird.

2476
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:12,860
I'll pour more alcohol.

2477
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,420
I feel so.

2478
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,960
They sell well, but they're not...

2479
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,000
Like, they're not really aggro right now.

2480
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,840
Because we haven't...

2481
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:23,520
We haven't put them in anywhere.

2482
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:29,400
Alright, I'm gonna see if I can find more heads for us.

2483
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,000
You'll die by yourself forever.

2484
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:39,040
What?

2485
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:42,920
You'll be by...

2486
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,680
Oh, hey, hey there.

2487
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:45,000
Hi.

2488
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,040
I'm trying to find more heads.

2489
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,360
I have more cake.

2490
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:49,920
Yum, yum, yum.

2491
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:52,280
But I couldn't find anybody.

2492
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,720
I just opened these doors...

2493
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,980
Yeah, there's no heads in there.

2494
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,140
What about here?

2495
01:38:58,860 --> 01:38:59,780
Oh, wait, there's a closet key.

2496
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:00,740
Didn't you have a closet key?

2497
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,200
Where the fuck are these heads?

2498
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:07,140
Oh, hey, there's a pumpkin.

2499
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,240
Wait, wait, there's a...

2500
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,520
Did you guys have a... There's a closet right here.

2501
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:17,420
Where's the closet key?

2502
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:19,700
Somebody has it, I remember.

2503
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:20,820
Oh, there it is.

2504
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,480
Oh, there it is!

2505
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:21,980
Zen, come here!

2506
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:23,520
Come on, boy!

2507
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:25,620
Okay, alright, sure.

2508
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:27,020
Put it closer, I guess.

2509
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:35,500
And I'll do it again.

2510
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:43,040
I got the head again.

2511
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:50,930
Alright, is there alcohol in there?

2512
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:51,710
I don't even know.

2513
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:53,790
Wait, there's no alcohol in here.

2514
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:55,530
How am I supposed to scrub the head?

2515
01:39:57,790 --> 01:40:00,010
I can't even scrub the head!

2516
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:05,550
Guys!

2517
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:06,930
I need alcohol!

2518
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,970
But, like, not for drinking.

2519
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:12,150
It's for cleaning reasons.

2520
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:13,010
Oh, there's one right here.

2521
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:13,750
Guys, I need...

2522
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,250
Someone pick an alcohol for me.

2523
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:17,850
Yeah, it's on the other side.

2524
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:19,870
It's right here.

2525
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:21,450
Yeah, I got it.

2526
01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:22,750
I can't clean it.

2527
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:26,870
Okay.

2528
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:27,690
It's for cleaning, guys.

2529
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:28,850
I don't have a problem.

2530
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:33,430
Alright.

2531
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:40,050
Until now.

2532
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:45,030
We will be the first VTubers who beat this game.

2533
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:47,850
It's true.

2534
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:51,110
Okay, I'm here waterboarding the head now.

2535
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:53,430
Tell us where all the other heads are.

2536
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:54,930
How do we put it face down?

2537
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:57,970
Tell us where all the heads are!

2538
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:00,450
There's a little baby head!

2539
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:02,410
Yeah, he's the ring boy.

2540
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:04,690
I feel like this looks like...

2541
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:06,350
You know how in Minecraft, you can, like...

2542
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:07,150
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2543
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:10,010
Did you find a head, boy?

2544
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:12,570
That's fine.

2545
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:13,490
It's just one guy.

2546
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:17,690
Yeah, but he's, like, super...

2547
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:18,790
They're super calm for now.

2548
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:22,270
The more heads we bury, the more aggro they get.

2549
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:23,970
Yeah, the more crazy they get.

2550
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,370
Alright, we just need...

2551
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:27,210
We just need to find another...

2552
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:29,910
Do you think we'll be able to find more heads, or is that it for now?

2553
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,070
I'm not sure.

2554
01:41:32,190 --> 01:41:35,030
We need to find the place to bury the shovel first.

2555
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:35,630
Which way?

2556
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:37,930
It was this way, outside here.

2557
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:40,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2558
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:43,870
And we should be able to have a shovel, like...

2559
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:44,930
Yeah, here.

2560
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:48,610
We'll find more alcohol, just in case.

2561
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:49,390
Oh, there's a shovel!

2562
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:49,990
I found a shovel!

2563
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:52,350
I found a shovel.

2564
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:54,230
Priest.

2565
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:56,830
A little bit of priest.

2566
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:58,670
I'm stuck.

2567
01:41:59,310 --> 01:41:59,890
Okay.

2568
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:01,930
That's nice, Sweeney Todd.

2569
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:06,880
Alright, I'm gonna...

2570
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,320
Okay, where is...

2571
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,280
Okay, that's the chef.

2572
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,800
Now I know where the chef is.

2573
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,660
Oh, there's more medkits here.

2574
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:18,640
There's a maid.

2575
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:19,520
I found the maid!

2576
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,640
Oh, there's a key!

2577
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:22,040
Oh, there's a key!

2578
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,420
I have the children's bedroom!

2579
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,340
Get a key just in time.

2580
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:26,960
Just in case.

2581
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:28,860
Okay.

2582
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,500
The children's bedroom has two doors.

2583
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:34,660
So make sure you get both of them.

2584
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:36,300
What are you looking at?

2585
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:37,220
Yeah, I see you.

2586
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:40,580
Okay.

2587
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:41,600
That's literally you.

2588
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,120
Yeah, but there can only be one.

2589
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,780
Okay, I got this.

2590
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,080
Wait, where's the other children's bedroom?

2591
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:50,480
Right here.

2592
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,240
Oh, there it is.

2593
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:56,060
Is there a head in here?

2594
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,520
Oh, there's a head here!

2595
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:02,620
There's a head here.

2596
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:03,940
Oh, I got him.

2597
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:07,930
Please.

2598
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:12,170
Alright, let's go clean it.

2599
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:23,690
Yoink.

2600
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:32,430
Alright, time to clean.

2601
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:34,530
Clean, clean, clean.

2602
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:35,770
Clean, clean, clean.

2603
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:38,930
I don't remember.

2604
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:41,890
We have five heads now.

2605
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:43,430
Alright.

2606
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:45,510
Alright, clean time.

2607
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:47,610
Where are the other heads?

2608
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:49,710
Tell me the information.

2609
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:51,330
Where are they?

2610
01:43:55,570 --> 01:43:56,710
Alright, I got an old man.

2611
01:43:56,910 --> 01:43:57,570
Oh, I got the priest.

2612
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:02,170
Yeah, yeah, he's new.

2613
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:05,550
Alright, do you think we can find more heads?

2614
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:06,250
Or is that it?

2615
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:11,490
No, we did.

2616
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:12,370
We just unlocked it.

2617
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:13,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2618
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:13,370
Yeah.

2619
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:16,470
So I feel like...

2620
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:18,570
Oh my God, your cake is so extra moldy.

2621
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:21,270
I feel like we should get five more alcohol and put it down here then.

2622
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:21,970
Just in case.

2623
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:26,090
Lime, are you okay?

2624
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:26,510
Lime?

2625
01:44:26,930 --> 01:44:28,890
Lime, are you... Lime, just talk to me.

2626
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:29,870
Yes, yes, I'm here.

2627
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:31,930
I wasn't disassociating myself.

2628
01:44:33,790 --> 01:44:34,910
Oh my God.

2629
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:35,730
Oh.

2630
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:39,270
What was the plan?

2631
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:40,810
Are we burying as many heads as possible?

2632
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:41,990
We are trying to...

2633
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:43,610
We're gonna go find all the alcohol.

2634
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:46,190
We're trying to stockpile the alcohol, just in case.

2635
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:47,690
Okay.

2636
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:49,810
Okay, I'm gonna make sure.

2637
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:56,070
Oh, we could.

2638
01:44:58,450 --> 01:44:59,770
Yeah, I think we're fine.

2639
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:01,330
Okay, I got some alcohol here.

2640
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:05,550
Okay, I'm gonna put more here.

2641
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:06,470
Alcohol downstairs.

2642
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:11,290
Okay, I got more alcohol.

2643
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:14,890
We can also stockpile medkits too.

2644
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:20,330
I have alcohol here.

2645
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:25,850
Alright, I mean we have three, that should be...

2646
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:27,770
It's not enough, but like...

2647
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:28,650
Yeah, it should be good.

2648
01:45:28,970 --> 01:45:30,710
One, two, three, four, five.

2649
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:33,390
We need two more, I guess?

2650
01:45:34,290 --> 01:45:34,970
I guess, yeah.

2651
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:37,210
I think that's fine, right?

2652
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:37,730
For now.

2653
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:39,350
Oh wait, then there's also...

2654
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:40,770
This one's filled, so...

2655
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:42,310
Yeah, I think we just need one more.

2656
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:43,910
We just need one more, yeah.

2657
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:53,420
This is the strat.

2658
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:54,780
Oh, there's one right here!

2659
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:56,720
He left it here.

2660
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:00,440
I think they just found it and left it here for us.

2661
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,060
Oh, I see you.

2662
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:05,380
You wanted out those heads.

2663
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:06,340
That's fucking right.

2664
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,540
Alright, here's the strat!

2665
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:09,480
It's time!

2666
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,620
It's time, everybody!

2667
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,760
Grab a head!

2668
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:15,400
Grab a head!

2669
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,120
I got the shovel.

2670
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:17,780
Wait, where's Lime?

2671
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,360
Okay, I got...

2672
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,900
Should we shovel them or just put the heads down?

2673
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:23,780
I don't know.

2674
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:25,020
I feel like the crows are gonna...

2675
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:26,740
There's not a lot of crows right now, though.

2676
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:28,780
But there's not a lot of crows right now.

2677
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,840
But we do need to put at least one hat.

2678
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,720
Yeah, that's true.

2679
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:35,000
I feel like we should just put them on now.

2680
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:38,380
I feel we should get the other shovel...

2681
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:40,100
and then one person puts it on...

2682
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,660
and the other person...

2683
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:42,160
Okay.

2684
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:44,580
Alright, let's...

2685
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:46,620
I think there's only one shovel, isn't there?

2686
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:48,500
Okay.

2687
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:49,780
Lime, we're ready!

2688
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:53,320
We're ready to bury some heads!

2689
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,480
Grab a head!

2690
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:55,780
Mine's a priest.

2691
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:57,540
Alright, let's go.

2692
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,560
Mine's a gigachat, I guess?

2693
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:03,580
Wait, wait, wait.

2694
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:07,820
Wait, is that the groom?

2695
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:09,280
Or is that a different one?

2696
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,340
It looks totally different.

2697
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,440
Alright, let's figure it out.

2698
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:14,840
Come on, let's go.

2699
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:15,440
Okay.

2700
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,540
Guess who?

2701
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:21,280
Guess who?

2702
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:25,460
Do you have facial hair?

2703
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:26,900
Alright.

2704
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:29,300
There's a medkit right here, by the way.

2705
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:31,580
Okay, that's a lady.

2706
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:32,800
That's a lady over there.

2707
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:35,000
Oh no, that's a little boy.

2708
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:36,620
That's...

2709
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:38,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2710
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,340
Is there bodies here?

2711
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,320
That's a flower girl.

2712
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:44,920
That's a red lady.

2713
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,380
I don't think that's...

2714
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,440
There's no more here, right?

2715
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:51,520
No, it's not this side.

2716
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:55,640
I think it's at the other side.

2717
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:57,760
It's the other side.

2718
01:47:59,360 --> 01:47:59,480
Oh yeah.

2719
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:02,600
Oh,

2720
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:11,230
that's the chef.

2721
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:12,750
Yeah.

2722
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:16,070
I think it's at the wedding reception, I think.

2723
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:23,430
That's the chef, that's the chef.

2724
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:25,150
So it's the wedding...

2725
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:26,690
We have to find the...

2726
01:48:26,690 --> 01:48:27,910
It has to be the wedding area.

2727
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:30,570
Maybe this one?

2728
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:31,070
This one right here?

2729
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:31,990
Oh no, that's my...

2730
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:33,050
That's my guy?

2731
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:36,890
No, this guy right here.

2732
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:37,570
Maybe this guy.

2733
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:39,090
No, my guy is the priest.

2734
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:41,950
Right here.

2735
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:44,450
Yeah, we found your guy.

2736
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:47,410
I think we found your guy.

2737
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:49,090
We found your guy.

2738
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:50,330
I think it's here.

2739
01:48:50,410 --> 01:48:51,230
It is a groom.

2740
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:54,750
It's not this guy?

2741
01:48:57,130 --> 01:48:57,950
Oh, okay.

2742
01:48:58,230 --> 01:48:59,050
Should we start burying?

2743
01:49:00,090 --> 01:49:00,290
Alright.

2744
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:03,070
Go, go, go, go!

2745
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:04,210
Snuffy, it's your turn!

2746
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:05,230
Snuffy!

2747
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:08,090
This is what you've been training for, boy.

2748
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:09,430
This is it.

2749
01:49:09,610 --> 01:49:10,670
I'm so proud of you.

2750
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:17,110
Snuffy, come here!

2751
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:20,010
Come here, come here, come here!

2752
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:21,190
Priest, priest!

2753
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:22,790
Priest, priest, priest!

2754
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:25,350
Uh-oh.

2755
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:26,510
We can stun her though.

2756
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:28,090
Yeah, for now, yeah.

2757
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:32,490
Alright, come here, come here, boy!

2758
01:49:32,630 --> 01:49:33,050
Come on!

2759
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,140
No, you've got your head.

2760
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:37,880
You've still got your head.

2761
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:38,920
You've got your head, you've got your head.

2762
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:39,920
Oh, okay.

2763
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,860
Wait, why did I see it on the side?

2764
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:44,880
It flew around the screen a little bit.

2765
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:45,380
It was weird.

2766
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:47,380
Yeah, yeah, the crow was about to grab it.

2767
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:49,880
Where's the red...

2768
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:51,740
Okay, I grabbed the medkit for now too.

2769
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:53,440
Where's the...

2770
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:55,940
Okay, where's the red...

2771
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,880
I don't remember where the...

2772
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,040
Right here, right here, right here, right here.

2773
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2774
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,400
Okay, if I see her, I'll get her.

2775
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,080
I got my guns.

2776
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:07,340
I'm burying you.

2777
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:09,460
I'm ready.

2778
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:11,600
She's here, she's here, she's here!

2779
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:12,800
Oh, just kidding.

2780
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:13,660
We got you.

2781
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:15,680
Alright, nice!

2782
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:18,280
She's still pissed, she's still pissed.

2783
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:18,600
Run!

2784
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,320
Wait, she's got red eyes, you guys.

2785
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:20,680
She's got...

2786
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,760
Run, run, run, run, run, run!

2787
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:24,800
I'm ready!

2788
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:26,500
Wait, did she get somebody?

2789
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:28,120
I think she got mid, I think she got mid.

2790
01:50:28,340 --> 01:50:29,240
I think she got mid.

2791
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:31,380
I gotta go to the other world.

2792
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:37,290
Mid, I'm coming!

2793
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:40,330
Oh, shit!

2794
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:41,530
Okay, not yet, not yet!

2795
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:42,270
I got stuck!

2796
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:43,790
But now I am!

2797
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:48,430
I got stuck, but here I am!

2798
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:52,430
What the fuck happened?

2799
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:54,130
Oh, there's a head, there's a head!

2800
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:54,710
We have a head!

2801
01:50:54,830 --> 01:50:55,890
There's a head right here!

2802
01:50:57,370 --> 01:50:58,550
We gotta get a cake!

2803
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:00,590
We gotta get a cake!

2804
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:07,460
Where's the cake when you need one?

2805
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,340
Guys, we need a cake!

2806
01:51:17,150 --> 01:51:20,170
Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me.

2807
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:29,850
I have cake, I have cake, I have cake!

2808
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:34,290
Where's the bot head?

2809
01:51:34,370 --> 01:51:34,790
I have a cake.

2810
01:51:35,030 --> 01:51:35,490
Oh, there he is!

2811
01:51:35,570 --> 01:51:35,830
Come on!

2812
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:40,030
Here he comes!

2813
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:41,370
Hello there, little guy!

2814
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:45,150
Oh, he's in the ghost world.

2815
01:51:45,930 --> 01:51:46,490
There you go, I got him.

2816
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:50,570
Okay, okay.

2817
01:51:52,290 --> 01:51:54,070
This is a team game!

2818
01:51:59,450 --> 01:52:01,390
Alright, I'll go wash the head.

2819
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:04,090
We need to find the other shovel.

2820
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:07,470
I think there's only one shovel.

2821
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:08,830
No, there's definitely two.

2822
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:11,750
I don't know where the other shovel is.

2823
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:13,410
Do we want to bury the other two heads?

2824
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:14,790
There's two more.

2825
01:52:14,930 --> 01:52:17,030
I have one as well, I have one, so we all have three.

2826
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:19,470
So we can bury the next wave.

2827
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:23,890
We'll bury the next wave of heads.

2828
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:26,790
It's faster than how fast you run.

2829
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:27,490
It sucks.

2830
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:31,690
I'm wondering if we're supposed to stun her, then turn our flashlights off and hide or something.

2831
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:33,570
I don't know.

2832
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:34,630
I think we just keep...

2833
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:37,410
Nice, alright.

2834
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:38,890
I have...

2835
01:52:38,890 --> 01:52:42,470
Okay, did someone take the baby head?

2836
01:52:42,650 --> 01:52:43,470
I have the maid.

2837
01:52:43,850 --> 01:52:45,730
I'm putting porn alcohol in now.

2838
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:47,430
I have the maid.

2839
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:54,350
Why can't I pick your rat off the floor and sell them?

2840
01:52:54,610 --> 01:52:56,590
Yeah, I have the maid, you have the chef.

2841
01:52:56,970 --> 01:52:57,630
Alright, let's go!

2842
01:52:57,910 --> 01:52:58,410
It's time!

2843
01:52:58,410 --> 01:52:59,370
Let's go, let's go!

2844
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:00,670
Let's go, let's go!

2845
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:01,690
Oh, okay.

2846
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:02,730
Nevermind.

2847
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:05,210
We gotta go.

2848
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:07,310
I think we still gotta go, though.

2849
01:53:07,670 --> 01:53:08,890
But, like, what do we...

2850
01:53:09,610 --> 01:53:11,070
Yeah, we gotta go.

2851
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:14,690
No, I think she just gets angry, you know?

2852
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:15,750
Every so often.

2853
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:16,330
Yeah.

2854
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:19,030
It's a little temper tantrum.

2855
01:53:19,090 --> 01:53:20,810
She just gets angry sometimes.

2856
01:53:23,070 --> 01:53:23,630
Oh, ouch!

2857
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:24,830
I got you, I got you.

2858
01:53:28,410 --> 01:53:30,410
Okay, I have...

2859
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:32,250
At least she's...

2860
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:32,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2861
01:53:37,450 --> 01:53:38,330
Alright, nice.

2862
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:40,730
I have...

2863
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:41,910
I have the maid.

2864
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:48,010
Oh no, she's dead.

2865
01:53:48,130 --> 01:53:48,710
Snuffy's dead.

2866
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:49,790
Alright, let's just bury...

2867
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,170
Wait, Snuffy has the...

2868
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:52,170
Snuffy has the shovel!

2869
01:53:52,170 --> 01:53:53,510
Oh no!

2870
01:53:54,490 --> 01:53:56,570
Wait, I have this guy, I think.

2871
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:58,030
Yeah, just put that guy in and grab the shovel.

2872
01:53:58,450 --> 01:53:59,050
I can...

2873
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:02,550
I'll guard the...

2874
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:03,750
Yeah, I'll guard the body.

2875
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:05,530
Just get the shovel.

2876
01:54:06,610 --> 01:54:07,330
Oh, it's Snuffy.

2877
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:11,250
Alright.

2878
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:14,310
Wait, okay, um...

2879
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:16,150
I have medkit, I have medkit!

2880
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:21,350
Please, please.

2881
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:23,890
She's gonna come over, I'm just gonna warn you.

2882
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:24,990
I'm just gonna...

2883
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:26,170
I have the maid!

2884
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:31,150
Oh, she's gonna come over.

2885
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:33,030
I have the maid, I have the maid, I have the maid!

2886
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:36,070
Yeah, where's the maid?

2887
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:37,210
I think it's on...

2888
01:54:37,210 --> 01:54:39,090
I think the maid is on the...

2889
01:54:39,090 --> 01:54:41,310
The maid is on the other side, right?

2890
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:41,970
Okay.

2891
01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:43,330
Just run.

2892
01:54:44,970 --> 01:54:45,770
I have the maid!

2893
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,010
Wait, who's this?

2894
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:49,030
A child.

2895
01:54:49,630 --> 01:54:50,170
Yeah.

2896
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:52,230
She's coming, she's behind you!

2897
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:58,450
I think the maid was, like, here.

2898
01:54:58,750 --> 01:54:59,870
Yeah, yeah, got it, got it, got it.

2899
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:01,910
Okay.

2900
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:06,170
She has red eyes!

2901
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:09,650
It's okay.

2902
01:55:09,910 --> 01:55:12,090
It's okay, I'll finish the job.

2903
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:13,810
I'll finish the job.

2904
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:16,130
Don't worry.

2905
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:17,350
Don't worry.

2906
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:19,390
I'll do it for you.

2907
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:20,730
Alright, let's go!

2908
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:23,130
She's gonna be angry, though.

2909
01:55:23,190 --> 01:55:25,130
She's gonna be angry now, but I got a medkit.

2910
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:26,130
Somebody pick up the shovel!

2911
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,050
Uh-oh.

2912
01:55:32,990 --> 01:55:33,570
Uh-oh.

2913
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:41,060
Uh-oh.

2914
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,360
Wait, what's the other head?

2915
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:46,580
Who has the other head?

2916
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:52,550
Who has the other head?

2917
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:00,620
I don't know who has the other head!

2918
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,540
What's the last head?

2919
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,160
Mint, get over here!

2920
01:56:08,570 --> 01:56:09,790
Mint, keep crawling!

2921
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:12,010
Get your lazy ass over here, Mint!

2922
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:17,210
Mint, I see you walking away!

2923
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:25,030
Mint, I can't go there!

2924
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:26,510
I need you to come here!

2925
01:56:31,510 --> 01:56:32,090
She's lying!

2926
01:56:40,610 --> 01:56:42,570
Oh, it doesn't stop her.

2927
01:56:42,910 --> 01:56:44,010
It doesn't stop her.

2928
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:45,010
She's still angry.

2929
01:56:50,410 --> 01:56:51,170
Oh, god.

2930
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:58,310
No, no, I'm dead!

2931
01:56:58,370 --> 01:56:58,790
I'm dead!

2932
01:56:58,830 --> 01:56:59,310
I'm dead!

2933
01:57:01,930 --> 01:57:04,290
She has red eyes!

2934
01:57:04,290 --> 01:57:04,490
I'm dead!

2935
01:57:11,050 --> 01:57:14,330
Oh, I have a head on me.

2936
01:57:15,490 --> 01:57:17,030
I have a head on me!

2937
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:20,770
I have a head!

2938
01:57:21,790 --> 01:57:23,110
I have a head right here!

2939
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:30,270
What the fuck, Lime?!

2940
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:31,170
There's a head here.

2941
01:57:33,670 --> 01:57:34,390
Yeah, yeah.

2942
01:57:34,610 --> 01:57:35,550
Right here, right here.

2943
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:37,010
He's just chilling.

2944
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:38,210
Oh, I see him.

2945
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:39,410
Was I yelling at Lime?

2946
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:41,130
Who the fuck was I yelling at?

2947
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:42,430
Oh, it was Lime.

2948
01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:43,770
I thought it was you.

2949
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:46,230
Because I was yelling at somebody to crawl over.

2950
01:57:46,670 --> 01:57:48,430
Oh, watch me get this head in front of you.

2951
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:49,250
You can't grab it.

2952
01:57:49,510 --> 01:57:50,350
Fuck you.

2953
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:02,150
Let's see if she's dead.

2954
01:58:03,110 --> 01:58:03,710
Let's see.

2955
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:06,050
I heard it.

2956
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:09,610
I heard it.

2957
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,270
Uh-oh.

2958
01:58:15,090 --> 01:58:16,990
Down I go.

2959
01:58:17,730 --> 01:58:19,350
Down I go.

2960
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:24,250
Off I go into the light.

2961
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:28,930
Off I go into the light.

2962
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:33,460
Hey, you guys got a head?

2963
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,020
Oh, hi.

2964
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:38,340
Oh, nice.

2965
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:39,880
I got you.

2966
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:42,600
I just got the water girl.

2967
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:44,800
Flower girl?

2968
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:46,700
Yeah, I'll put the alcohol back in there.

2969
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,700
I saw a bird carrying a head.

2970
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:50,260
Oh.

2971
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:52,920
That could be the ring boy, right?

2972
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:54,040
Because we didn't do the ring boy.

2973
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,760
No, we did do the ring boy.

2974
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,200
Who the fuck did we not do?

2975
01:58:58,360 --> 01:58:58,800
What?

2976
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:02,480
I think it was the chef.

2977
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:03,660
Oh, maybe.

2978
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:06,840
Yeah, I think somebody took the chef.

2979
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:09,200
The crow took the chef.

2980
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:10,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2981
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:11,020
Yeah.

2982
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:13,920
Fuck your boy.

2983
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:15,420
Water girl.

2984
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:17,740
Wait, where's the chef?

2985
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:19,160
Right here, right here.

2986
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:23,570
Um, you think we can do it?

2987
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:26,050
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2988
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:26,610
No, no, no.

2989
01:59:26,630 --> 01:59:27,850
Go back, go back, go back, go back.

2990
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:29,130
Go back, go back, go back.

2991
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:32,290
I saw them chasing Lyman and Stuffy.

2992
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:33,290
I saw them chasing.

2993
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:34,930
I saw...

2994
01:59:34,930 --> 01:59:37,150
If we have to wait out, we gotta go.

2995
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:40,570
Yeah, but we gotta wait for them to chase them and then we'll go.

2996
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:41,810
Okay.

2997
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:44,510
We can always adopt new children.

2998
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:46,150
No.

2999
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:48,150
Oh.

3000
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:48,810
Yeah?

3001
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:49,430
Yeah?

3002
01:59:49,570 --> 01:59:50,510
You wanna go back out?

3003
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:52,650
Okay, she's gone.

3004
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:53,490
Okay, nice.

3005
01:59:54,690 --> 01:59:55,470
Know what?

3006
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:58,170
Um...

3007
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:02,460
Me too, I think so too.

3008
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,200
I think she is...

3009
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:05,560
Okay.

3010
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:12,140
Right here.

3011
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:13,140
I...

3012
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:17,060
Okay.

3013
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:21,180
Back into the spirit world I go.

3014
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:26,060
The last spot.

3015
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,500
Right here.

3016
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:31,880
Right fucking here.

3017
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:35,120
Yep, it's right here.

3018
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:39,260
Guys, we're running out of bed.

3019
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:40,540
Kids, guys.

3020
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,520
Oh, there's a head.

3021
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:44,820
Okay, I'll look at you.

3022
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:47,180
There's the head right here.

3023
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:48,700
I see you.

3024
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:50,860
I see you.

3025
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:53,720
I see you.

3026
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:55,900
Come on.

3027
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:58,140
As long as I'm next to the head.

3028
02:00:58,240 --> 02:00:59,700
There's two heads up here.

3029
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:00,900
There's two heads.

3030
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:02,320
That's seven, eight.

3031
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:04,560
Nine, there's two more.

3032
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,420
Okay, we're missing two.

3033
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:08,080
There's two heads up here.

3034
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:11,560
Please, somebody go to the other world.

3035
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:14,640
There's two heads.

3036
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:16,020
Where did the other head go?

3037
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:16,760
Okay.

3038
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:22,300
I need to go to that window, that mirror.

3039
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:27,100
Tell the whole world that there's two heads and then come back.

3040
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:32,610
Where are they?

3041
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:33,690
Oh.

3042
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:35,890
There's one, two.

3043
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:39,230
One, two.

3044
02:01:40,450 --> 02:01:41,570
Oh, there's the other head.

3045
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:42,530
There she is.

3046
02:01:43,030 --> 02:01:44,190
There she goes.

3047
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:48,010
I think there's only two bedkits left.

3048
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:52,130
Oh my God.

3049
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:54,310
Guys, I don't know if we're gonna make it.

3050
02:01:54,750 --> 02:01:55,950
Where is everyone?

3051
02:01:56,370 --> 02:01:58,310
Where did everyone go?

3052
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:02,650
Where is everybody?

3053
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:06,830
Where are you guys?

3054
02:02:14,590 --> 02:02:15,470
Guys!

3055
02:02:16,050 --> 02:02:17,410
I found two heads.

3056
02:02:18,010 --> 02:02:19,110
I found two heads.

3057
02:02:20,210 --> 02:02:20,810
Upstairs.

3058
02:02:21,190 --> 02:02:21,850
Yeah, upstairs.

3059
02:02:22,770 --> 02:02:24,170
Oh my God!

3060
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:26,470
Let me go grab some.

3061
02:02:30,550 --> 02:02:30,910
Okay.

3062
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:32,910
Who has the other shovel?

3063
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:33,790
Who has the shovel?

3064
02:02:34,990 --> 02:02:35,810
I don't know.

3065
02:02:36,490 --> 02:02:37,970
Wait, weren't you holding a head earlier?

3066
02:02:41,610 --> 02:02:42,770
She's coming for you.

3067
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:44,210
She's coming for you.

3068
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:45,690
She's coming for you.

3069
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:46,670
She's coming for you.

3070
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:48,090
Alright, let's figure out who she's coming for.

3071
02:02:48,210 --> 02:02:49,810
Alright, let's fucking try and test it out.

3072
02:02:51,410 --> 02:02:52,130
I'm gonna shut the door.

3073
02:02:52,130 --> 02:02:54,230
Okay, I'm gonna shut this other door.

3074
02:02:57,130 --> 02:02:57,570
Alright.

3075
02:03:04,650 --> 02:03:06,050
Come on in, boy.

3076
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:11,610
Maybe it was a mistake.

3077
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:17,690
Wait, I thought you were holding a head earlier.

3078
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:18,350
What were you holding on?

3079
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:19,990
It's right by the altar.

3080
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:22,050
The shovel is right by the altar outside.

3081
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:23,010
That's where I died.

3082
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:23,870
Okay, okay.

3083
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:25,510
Should we go?

3084
02:03:25,770 --> 02:03:26,450
Yeah, let's go.

3085
02:03:26,650 --> 02:03:27,710
She's not mad anymore.

3086
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:29,130
She's not?

3087
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:29,990
That's good.

3088
02:03:32,490 --> 02:03:33,510
Oh yeah, you're right.

3089
02:03:33,690 --> 02:03:37,190
Yeah, yeah, where's the... Okay, I'm trying to find the shovel that you threw away.

3090
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:37,910
Oh, I found it!

3091
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:38,330
I found it!

3092
02:03:39,070 --> 02:03:40,030
I found the shovel!

3093
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:40,830
There's a crew!

3094
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:44,310
No.

3095
02:03:44,890 --> 02:03:45,670
Oh no.

3096
02:03:46,350 --> 02:03:47,110
Oh no.

3097
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,950
Oh no.

3098
02:03:51,970 --> 02:03:54,710
Snuffy, let me know if she's coming for me!

3099
02:03:58,150 --> 02:03:59,570
Wait, where did Snuffy go?

3100
02:04:02,290 --> 02:04:03,110
Oh no.

3101
02:04:05,970 --> 02:04:06,930
Guys, I don't know.

3102
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:08,490
Guys, I don't think we're gonna win this.

3103
02:04:08,790 --> 02:04:10,030
Wait, how did the door open?

3104
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:12,750
How did the door open by itself?

3105
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:26,010
Who's out there?

3106
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:34,760
Oh my god.

3107
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:36,560
Oh, now there's two.

3108
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:37,360
There's two.

3109
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:38,500
Now there's two.

3110
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:41,220
Oh no, now it's me and Mint!

3111
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:42,420
Oh no!

3112
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:48,220
And now there were two.

3113
02:04:53,890 --> 02:04:55,170
I have the shovel!

3114
02:04:58,630 --> 02:05:00,170
You have the head?

3115
02:05:01,510 --> 02:05:02,830
I have the shovel!

3116
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:05,270
I have the shovel, Mint!

3117
02:05:05,850 --> 02:05:07,210
Oh, she's coming by you!

3118
02:05:11,870 --> 02:05:15,070
Okay, I closed the door.

3119
02:05:22,510 --> 02:05:24,670
Do you guys know where the medkits are?

3120
02:05:26,650 --> 02:05:27,770
No, I got you!

3121
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:28,250
I got you!

3122
02:05:28,450 --> 02:05:28,930
Please!

3123
02:05:35,810 --> 02:05:36,290
Please!

3124
02:05:36,290 --> 02:05:36,770
Mint!

3125
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:37,570
I'm not done yet!

3126
02:05:41,590 --> 02:05:42,630
No!

3127
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:42,950
Mint, please!

3128
02:05:47,130 --> 02:05:47,650
No.

3129
02:05:48,130 --> 02:05:49,170
No.

3130
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:50,310
No!

3131
02:05:53,470 --> 02:05:54,510
I'm done!

3132
02:05:55,010 --> 02:05:55,750
I'm done!

3133
02:05:56,610 --> 02:05:57,650
No!

3134
02:06:01,190 --> 02:06:03,050
I'm gonna die to Mint!

3135
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:12,270
Oh my god.

3136
02:06:12,410 --> 02:06:14,230
Oh my god.

3137
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:15,450
We have nothing!

3138
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:17,370
We have no medkits!

3139
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:19,630
No!

3140
02:06:27,170 --> 02:06:28,290
No!

3141
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:34,880
Bodyblocker!

3142
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:37,200
Bodyblocker!

3143
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:41,160
Crows!

3144
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,220
The crows!

3145
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:45,940
They don't stop!

3146
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:48,640
They don't stop!

3147
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:49,360
No!

3148
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:49,840
The crows!

3149
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,780
I died to the crows!

3150
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:56,740
I died to the crows!

3151
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:02,340
I died to the crows!

3152
02:07:02,860 --> 02:07:03,120
No!

3153
02:07:05,980 --> 02:07:08,640
Oh my god.

3154
02:07:21,190 --> 02:07:22,970
Oh, dang it.

3155
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:26,970
I died to the crows!

3156
02:07:27,910 --> 02:07:28,970
I couldn't...

3157
02:07:30,090 --> 02:07:31,650
Oh my god.

3158
02:07:35,410 --> 02:07:36,130
No!

3159
02:07:39,470 --> 02:07:40,810
No, that's not true!

3160
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:42,410
I died to the crows!

3161
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:44,030
I died a different way!

3162
02:07:45,590 --> 02:07:46,950
I couldn't!

3163
02:07:47,010 --> 02:07:48,550
There was nothing I could do!

3164
02:07:51,090 --> 02:07:51,810
My...

3165
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:58,010
I couldn't kill the crows, so I kept I kept fucking flashing them!

3166
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:00,950
Yeah.

3167
02:08:05,150 --> 02:08:09,470
And she even did the thing like, I'll get you next time, so I was like, ooh, I'm safe.

3168
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:15,570
And her eyes were red, so it didn't really look like she wasn't gonna keep going, but she was just like, actually, bye.

3169
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:18,690
She was red on my screen, so I think it's also kinda buggy.

3170
02:08:18,690 --> 02:08:20,410
Oh my god.

3171
02:08:20,510 --> 02:08:21,010
You know what?

3172
02:08:21,150 --> 02:08:22,650
We did really well, guys.

3173
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:23,630
I think we did...

3174
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:25,770
I think we did really well.

3175
02:08:25,770 --> 02:08:29,410
I think we did as well as we could.

3176
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:32,590
We just didn't have any perks, so you can't blame us.

3177
02:08:32,630 --> 02:08:34,030
We just didn't have any perks.

3178
02:08:35,090 --> 02:08:35,550
Yeah.

3179
02:08:35,550 --> 02:08:37,550
I only just got a perk now.

3180
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:38,230
Yeah.

3181
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:39,070
Oh, right.

3182
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:40,290
There's perks in this game.

3183
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:41,030
Right.

3184
02:08:41,690 --> 02:08:43,630
I still can't actually do anything with the perks.

3185
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:44,310
It's greyed out.

3186
02:08:45,190 --> 02:08:46,350
Yeah, it's greyed out for me.

3187
02:08:46,350 --> 02:08:47,570
Actually, I was trying to click on it.

3188
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:48,350
It wasn't letting me.

3189
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:50,410
Yeah, I don't think we have perks.

3190
02:08:50,630 --> 02:08:50,870
Oh, wait.

3191
02:08:50,950 --> 02:08:51,710
I turned it on.

3192
02:08:52,290 --> 02:08:53,430
Now we have perks.

3193
02:08:53,450 --> 02:08:54,930
I'm gonna spend my perk on an emote instead.

3194
02:08:56,590 --> 02:08:57,550
Good idea.

3195
02:08:59,930 --> 02:09:00,890
Oh my god.

3196
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:04,550
You literally can have faster movement if you...

3197
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:05,250
This is...

3198
02:09:05,250 --> 02:09:07,550
This is actually crying to win.

3199
02:09:08,490 --> 02:09:12,930
You can move faster when getting chased by the demon.

3200
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:17,950
Fast worker?

3201
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:20,050
And you have... You're faster.

3202
02:09:20,370 --> 02:09:23,070
You're faster when you're carrying ritual items.

3203
02:09:24,850 --> 02:09:25,530
Oh my god.

3204
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:26,390
This is...

3205
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:28,090
This is all about the grind.

3206
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:30,750
This is all...

3207
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:32,610
Wait, there's hiding spots?

3208
02:09:33,030 --> 02:09:35,030
There was no hiding spots.

3209
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:38,230
It's like UV charge reject... Oh, it's for the spider lady.

3210
02:09:38,330 --> 02:09:41,650
Cause the fucking manor did not have hiding spots for sure.

3211
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:44,150
Uh...

3212
02:09:44,150 --> 02:09:51,630
Yeah, maybe the other maps make more sense and we accidentally just went in on like the equivalent of level 15 Pico Park or something.

3213
02:09:51,870 --> 02:09:52,430
Oh my god.

3214
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:54,730
Do you remember some of the maps had like closets you could hide in?

3215
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:55,310
No, it doesn't.

3216
02:09:55,370 --> 02:09:56,510
That's why I'm saying the spider.

3217
02:09:56,630 --> 02:09:57,830
The spider has like...

3218
02:09:57,830 --> 02:10:01,570
Yeah, but you were saying... People were saying the manor was like different from how they usually do.

3219
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:04,370
So I think they got rid of the hiding spots for the manor.

3220
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:05,070
I don't know why.

3221
02:10:05,310 --> 02:10:06,810
That's some sick, cruel joke.

3222
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:08,510
It was too easy.

3223
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:08,790
It was too easy.

3224
02:10:10,770 --> 02:10:12,930
That's some sick fucking joke.

3225
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:14,770
For getting rid of the hiding spots.

3226
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:15,890
It was not easy.

3227
02:10:16,030 --> 02:10:18,930
I remember struggling so hard on the end.

3228
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:23,830
I remember the fucking spiders.

3229
02:10:25,110 --> 02:10:26,050
Yeah, I know.

3230
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:28,990
What's the lore with that?

3231
02:10:29,170 --> 02:10:36,010
There's a giant spider lady that's gonna fucking eat you and then instead of crows, it's other spiders that try to attack your ankles.

3232
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:38,750
They like, try to gobble your ankles.

3233
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:41,130
Honestly, that kind of sounds fun for next time, maybe.

3234
02:10:41,710 --> 02:10:45,310
Yeah, Lime is just wants to fucking pass out right now.

3235
02:10:46,410 --> 02:10:49,710
I mean, if we can do it this time, I'm so ready.

3236
02:10:51,070 --> 02:10:52,250
No, I could fail.

3237
02:10:52,370 --> 02:10:53,490
I was like, Lime, are you okay?

3238
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:57,070
You just stare out into the space and I'm like, she is not okay.

3239
02:10:57,290 --> 02:10:58,790
She is not okay.

3240
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:01,170
I'm trying.

3241
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:03,210
I'm trying really hard to be okay.

3242
02:11:03,210 --> 02:11:03,570
I don't know.

3243
02:11:04,890 --> 02:11:06,430
No, it's okay.

3244
02:11:06,810 --> 02:11:11,190
I like how Lime bought this movement speed increase perk already.

3245
02:11:11,610 --> 02:11:12,630
She just...

3246
02:11:13,210 --> 02:11:15,470
I'm ready to go fucking fast.

3247
02:11:17,170 --> 02:11:23,450
Yeah, she already bought the movement speed after getting fucked over by the bride because we were too slow.

3248
02:11:24,370 --> 02:11:26,210
I know what I'm gonna buy then.

3249
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:27,490
What are you buying?

3250
02:11:29,330 --> 02:11:32,690
You can't use, you can't use your fucking perks to buy emotes.

3251
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:33,890
Oh my god, I can flex.

3252
02:11:36,130 --> 02:11:37,450
Oh my god, do you see that?

3253
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:38,170
No, no, no.

3254
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:41,890
Movement speed increased by 25% when pursued by a Zazel.

3255
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:42,950
Oh, you can.

3256
02:11:45,030 --> 02:11:46,550
Pursued by a Zazel?

3257
02:11:46,630 --> 02:11:47,650
Which one is a Zazel?

3258
02:11:48,090 --> 02:11:49,030
Oh, that's the bride.

3259
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:53,710
What the fuck emote did you buy?

3260
02:11:54,070 --> 02:11:55,790
What did you...

3261
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:57,490
I bought finger guns.

3262
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:03,250
Oh my god.

3263
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:04,090
How do you do emotes?

3264
02:12:04,790 --> 02:12:07,550
You have to get in game for that.

3265
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:12,520
Oh, I see the finger gun.

3266
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:14,320
This is the one I bought, right?

3267
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:15,680
I see it.

3268
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:18,480
I see the finger gun.

3269
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:20,760
How do I buy them?

3270
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:23,260
You have to scroll down to the emote, you go to outfits.

3271
02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:27,640
And then, no, you go to outfits and then you scroll all the way down for the perks.

3272
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:30,080
Like, you can use your perk talismans to buy it.

3273
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,160
The other one.

3274
02:12:31,620 --> 02:12:33,500
Wait, so there was a finger gun that I didn't need to buy.

3275
02:12:34,980 --> 02:12:35,940
Oh, this one, yeah.

3276
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:37,600
Oh, I got the draw gun.

3277
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:40,680
Oh, you didn't buy the finger gun?

3278
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:44,200
You have to win a game in a hard mode as Sam.

3279
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:45,060
Oh my god.

3280
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:47,880
Nevermind, I hate this game.

3281
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:50,300
Yeah, I don't think we can...

3282
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:52,220
We can barely do normal, guys.

3283
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:54,420
We can barely...

3284
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:55,900
GG's, though.

3285
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:56,800
I had fun.

3286
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:57,840
GG's.

3287
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,220
I had a lot of fun.

3288
02:12:59,360 --> 02:12:59,900
Thank you.

3289
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:01,360
I'm sorry we're so out of it.

3290
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:02,160
No, it's alright.

3291
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:03,740
You had a long day.

3292
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:05,180
It was super cozy, yeah.

3293
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:06,920
Thank you guys for inviting me.

3294
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:09,460
Thanks for the nice family vacation, guys.

3295
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:10,700
I had a great time.

3296
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:11,900
Yeah, we had a great time.

3297
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:14,680
I forgot I left a lot of them.

3298
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:16,100
Yeah, yeah.

3299
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:21,300
It's okay, next time...

3300
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:22,300
The voices, they're gone.

3301
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:25,960
By the way, Min, you're muted.

3302
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:27,860
You're muted, so we can't hear you.

3303
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:29,700
Bless me with my voice.

3304
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:33,260
Oh, and then Lime is still disassociated, so she's deafened.

3305
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:35,520
She's just staring at her monitor.

3306
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:40,240
And Lime...

3307
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:41,720
Undeafened.

3308
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,900
Let her sleep.

3309
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:47,920
It's okay.

3310
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:54,120
I thought you guys just ditched me.

3311
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:54,520
No!

3312
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:59,600
The voices were echoing, so we were like...

3313
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:02,740
No, I was deafened, and I just completely forgot we were in Discord.

3314
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:04,720
I guess that's it.

3315
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:06,300
I guess they just left everyone.

3316
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:11,720
That was fun.

3317
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:14,480
Yeah, it was fun.

3318
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:14,920
It's okay.

3319
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:18,060
Yeah, no, next time, we just gamer it.

3320
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:18,900
And we win.

3321
02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:19,860
Easy peasy.

3322
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:20,160
Spiders.

3323
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:21,800
I'm ready to face the spiders.

3324
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:24,460
Oh, the spiders.

3325
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:25,940
Oh my gosh, we just have a whole devour marathon.

3326
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:30,220
A whole devour marathon where we never beat the game.

3327
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:34,680
We just lose over and over again.

3328
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:37,080
We always die.

3329
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:41,740
We can YouTube the ending of someone who bought all the perks.

3330
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:44,880
I wish I knew.

3331
02:14:44,980 --> 02:14:46,880
I would've just bought them to start with.

3332
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:49,460
And you have to earn the little things.

3333
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:52,660
You can't pay to win perks.

3334
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:55,400
You actually have to earn them through tier playing.

3335
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:57,120
So they hate fun.

3336
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:58,320
They really do.

3337
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:02,020
That's why they want us to play.

3338
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:03,500
So we keep having fun.

3339
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:06,060
That's the whole point.

3340
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:09,840
I wish I could hit that woman with a shovel.

3341
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:15,100
You can say doki.

3342
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:16,440
Yeah, you can say it.

3343
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:20,140
I've just encountered so many croquis.

3344
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,440
I deserved it.

3345
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:25,960
GG's guys.

3346
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:27,760
I had a great time.

3347
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:30,040
Thank you for playing.

3348
02:15:30,420 --> 02:15:31,820
Let's do it again next time.

3349
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:32,620
Bye-bye.

3350
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:34,600
Bye-bye.

3351
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:37,480
I'll see you...

3352
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:37,840
Oh, okay.

3353
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:43,900
I thought Min wanted to stay for an extra second or something.

3354
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:46,620
She didn't instantly.

3355
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:47,700
Anyway, guys.

3356
02:15:48,260 --> 02:15:49,500
I'm going to head off now.

3357
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:51,460
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

3358
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:55,320
It was a double stream.

3359
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:56,840
So I'm going to...

3360
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:58,260
I'm going to pass out now.

3361
02:15:58,580 --> 02:15:59,780
I'm going to grab some food.

3362
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:00,880
I need to walk, dad.

3363
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:03,080
Anyway, guys.

3364
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:05,120
As always, everybody.

3365
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:06,200
Stay hydrated.

3366
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:06,960
Posture check.

3367
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:08,640
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3368
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:10,400
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3369
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:11,560
Because you deserve it.

3370
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:12,800
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3371
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:13,900
Bye, guys.

3372
02:16:15,540 --> 02:16:17,260
I'm so sorry for the...

3373
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:20,040
How loud the jump scares were.

3374
02:16:20,900 --> 02:16:22,400
We tried our best.

3375
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:22,980
We tried.

3376
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:25,080
I'm so sorry.

3377
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:27,340
I'll see you guys later.

3378
02:16:27,480 --> 02:16:27,880
Bye.
