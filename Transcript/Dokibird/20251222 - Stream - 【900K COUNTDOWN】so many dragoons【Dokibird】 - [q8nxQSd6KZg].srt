huge chunk of my Planned Christmas stream is being moved to

79
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,400
I shall now try to figure out what to replace it with on
Christmas.

80
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,960
Oh yeah, we'll do an 800k celebration on Christmas.

81
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,760
You know, you're right.

82
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
That's actually pretty good.

83
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,820
All right, 800, I'll do like 800k celebration.

84
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,620
And because we were supposed to play the climbing game.

85
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,220
We're supposed to beat the climbing game.

86
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,940
So 800k, that was the climbing game, right?

87
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,200
That was for 800k.

88
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,420
I don't remember, right?

89
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,000
So, so we'll do that.

90
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,860
We'll do the 800K celebration, and then we'll go straight to
the 900K celebration on the 27th.

91
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,680
And then, and then there's New Year.

92
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,120
There is like, it's like our own little special Christmas
week.

93
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,860
The United States does not celebrate boxing with exceptions
of Massachusetts.

But I will be free.

156

But I'll feel free.

158
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,380

twist and it is such a no one expected the plot twist to Um,

182
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,260
I'm tired.

183
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:02,380
Who would have thought playing six hours of Mar-a-Ravos not
straight can make you very tired.

184
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,600
I was just like, I was just like, brain so tired, cannot
talk anymore.

185
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,920
I just wanted to, I, okay, I didn't, I didn't stream it
because I was like, it's just two to three games.

186
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,920
like it's just it's just two to three games you know like i
know i don't need to stream it and then i was like i kept

187
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,560
playing i was like all right the next game will be the last
one i'll i'll head off for the next game and i just kept

188
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:37,000
going i'm like okay i'll do like one more win if i do one
more win i'll be i'll be back to where i started and i kept

189
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,620
going and i was like oh wait i'm like back to where i
started but if i do one more win then i'll be up one game so

190
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:52,300
it's like after it would it wouldn't be like for nothing i
can be up points and then after i'm up one more i'm like

191
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,180
i'll do one more because now i'll be like up two games and i
lost the game and i'll be like okay well now i'm back to

192
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:04,740
where i started so i should do one more so i can be up one
game and i'm up one game and i'll be like okay i should do

193
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,920
one more and i'll be up two games and i lost two in a row
and i'm like well i'm down a game so i should do one more so

194
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,900
i can be back where i started and then

195
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,260
It's just a never, it's a never-ending cycle.

196
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,300
It just one more.

197
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,040
It never, it just never ends.

198
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,720
And this is why I don't gamble, because I know I'd be really
fucked.

199
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,700
I hate to keep stuck on that cycle.

200
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,740

No, I cannot.

208
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,440
I cannot stop anytime.

209
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:59,980
a problem i i i know i have a problem i can i know i can't
stop um um but yeah i hope next year i can reach a million

210
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:08,060
subscribers it is a huge milestone next year i'm planning on
going more um i guess like focusing more on content i i i

211
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:15,660
got a little late i got really lazy i got really lazy for
half the year because i've been like so overwhelmed i guess

212
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,700
like overworked and overwhelmed and just like, I just wanted
to like play Marvel

213
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:33,660
It's bad, I was just like But like next year I will be More
focused More focused on making content I really want to do

214
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:44,600
videos next year Not like making like original But like
getting an editor to make To make like Like I guess like

215
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,320
What's the word called?

216
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,820
edited videos for like recaps of like maybe like long games
or long streams that i do because i've seen some people i've

217
00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:00,600
seen some dragoons who aren't stream watchers but literally
just watch my shorts and they're like oh i like uh i even

218
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,840
during meeting greets highlights highlights that's what
they're called highlights guys guys you tell i'm really

219
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:16,940
tired i'm you can tell i'm really fucking tired i'm like
what the fuck are these called like i don't even know what

220
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:29,640
did i say what did i say before um um yeah so uh i'm so out
of it no brain is not working right now um but i do want to

221
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:36,680
do like highlight videos uh just because like i have had
dragoons come to me during meeting rates too where they're

222
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:43,400
like oh i just i watch your shorts i don't really watch your
streams um but i love watching your shorts and um and

223
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,460
everything and um so i figured like video highlight videos
are also like really good too for the joe's dragoons we

224
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:57,580
can't make it to uh to live streams or uh you know they
don't want to watch a playthrough in the middle of a

225
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,640
playthrough so you know they usually don't watch the stream
because they're like oh i came in during the middle of this

226
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,260
playthrough so i'm not just not gonna try and catch up to it
since it's so long so i figured doing highlights um for

227
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:17,540
those who can't uh commit to the uh the stream in general
and you know they're you know little bite-sized versions of

228
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:25,940
the videos as well yeah so i'm definitely gonna do that for
next year uh but the hardest part is just find like finding

229
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:34,340
the perfect editor and also like um because i tried i tried
to do it at first um but when i was sent the highlight like

230
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:42,340
i had i was given a highlight video and it was very long i
just didn't have time committed to like watch the video to

231
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:50,240
check on it so i was like okay i need to like outsource i
need to like wait but not outsource um i need to like oh

232
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,800
what's the oh my gosh i can't i need a dictionary right now

233
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:07,960
um sd thank you for the 20 gifted chips thank you thank you
um delegate yeah delegate sorry you're my dictionary right

234
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:22,060
now i can't my brain is like i forgot every word possible
like i i have done like i i do not have a frontal lobe right

235
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:33,720
now um um anyway so uh like i'm like at chat what is this
word uh so fried so i need to delegate it to one of my staff

236
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:41,140
to like watch the videos and like trust them into making
sure the video is a good video that people are interested in

237
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:49,460
watching um which because i don't have the time to watch the
highlights and like do like the the approvals for everything

238
00:21:49,460 --> 00:22:00,240
uh because i want to be sure like it's entertaining and
everything too yeah i'm no i'm i'm out of it if i wanted to

246
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:05,080
million subscribers soon we're a hundred thousand away from
a million subscribers And that is also a giant milestone

247
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,180
leading up to it.

248
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,740
Don't go into the light.

249
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,080
Billy, thank you for the super chat.

250
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,340
Thank you.

251
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:13,880
Thank you.

252
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,420
Congrats on 900K.

253
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,320
It's very difficult to grow as an Instagram, but you made
it.

254
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,600
A small tip about short videos.

255
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,800
Eight minutes plus a few seconds is a very good highlight
video link for the YouTube algorithm.

256
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,660
Thank you and super chat.

257
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:24,920
Thank you.

258
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,460
Thank you.

259
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,800
I think eight minutes is going to be really hard for my
editors.

260
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,900
I'm going to trust my editors to like.

261
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:43,220
to um like do whatever length they can condense it to
especially if i do like a five hour stream i feel like eight

262
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:54,800
minutes is a little too uh too short for an eight hour
stream so um whatever i think i'm just whatever works the

263
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:03,980
best in condensing a stream um The thing is, I don't want to
do parts for like a playthrough because then like, you know,

264
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,480
it's like part one, part two, part three.

265
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,980
Because I don't think that's a thing anymore either on
YouTube because I know back then people would be like 10

266
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,640
minutes and one second.

267
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,080
I don't know if you guys remember that.

268
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,960
Like back in the old YouTube days, especially Game Grumps,
they would just make all their videos 10 minutes and one

269
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,280
second and then divide it by like part one, part two, part
three.

270
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,320
but then they uh yeah they don't like parts anymore so they
change the algorithm and i want to do something like queso

271
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:41,040
where he just i mean queso videos aren't really edited to be
fair so um but i do want some editing going into the video

272
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:48,680
um for playthroughs because he literally just upload the
entire playthrough into like one video um so something like

273
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:55,780
that i'm thinking of because it's not like clipping whereas
you know um we're grabbing like the best moments uh just

274
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,560
like, you know, segments of the best moment.

275
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:05,120
I still want people who are watching the video to understand
the playthrough and what's going on in the story, even

276
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,640
though they can't watch the live stream.

277
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,900
So it's like, I guess it's like a super cut.

278
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,440
Yeah, like a super cut video.

279
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,920
Lord Corosis, thank you for the magenta soup.

280
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,560
Thank you.

281
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,320
Thank you.

282
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,560
Can you check the latest Dragon Public Squad upload on
YouTube and perhaps react to it live?

283
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,120
A little gift from us for 900K.

284
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:35,280
I won't be able to it up on the stream because then like i'm
worried because i i don't want to accidentally like i have

285
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:42,600
to like set it up for browser stuff so like that's why like
before i stream i set everything up before then um but i

286
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:53,860
haven't set up anything to like watch something i don't want
to accidentally like click the wrong link or like

287
00:25:53,860 --> 00:26:02,680
accidentally like dox myself with a browser so so that's why
i'm like super careful about it because um so i know like i

288
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,860
would do like incognito mode every time i open something um
if i show something on stream i make sure to have the

289
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:16,280
incognito mode for the browser so i wouldn't like
accidentally show anything that that were i might actually

290
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,660
dox myself or actually click on something.

291
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:27,360
I remember in the packs, I'll give an incident that happened
before, but I actually doxxed my personal email.

292
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,040
Because I didn't go incognito mode.

293
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,460
Because like, randomly I was like, oh, I wanted to like
click on something.

294
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,820
And it required me to sign in.

295
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,560
And it revealed my personal email.

296
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,580
And I was like, oh, fuck, okay.

297
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,940
So I never again, I'm like super careful.

298
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,700
careful now.

299
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,500
I'm super careful when I show anything on stream.

300
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,680
Yeah, it's very scary.

301
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,740
Oh my god.

302
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,160
And then like, it's so weird.

303
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,400
Okay, so I got like my PayPal email got revealed somewhere.

304
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,400
I don't know how.

305
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,680
But it's so weird.

306
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,700
So my PayPal email, because I don't use my PayPal email.

307
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,840
It's like a

308
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,060
That's unrelated to like the business email.

309
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,280
And then someone like, I don't know who this fucking person
is.

310
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,600
It's so weird.

311
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,500
That's been like sending me like money requests, being like,
please give me $5.

312
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:41,960
Like I almost paid for it because I was paying my invoices
to artists or like people I work with for a special like for

313
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,620
like projects or stuff.

314
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,940
And then they've been doing this the last two months.

315
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,400
months.

316
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,120
They've been sending me like, like $5 invoices and asking me
to be like, please give me money.

317
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,860
And I'm like, because they're like, please give me money.

318
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,580
I'm broke.

319
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,200
I'm like, how did you find this email?

320
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,720
How did you find this email?

321
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,400
And they've been doing it every month.

322
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,900
I would reject it.

323
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,760
And then the next month, they send it again.

324
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,640
And it's in the last three months.

325
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,700
I don't know how to block this guy's email.

326
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,240
Here's my dollars for that guy.

327
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,080

it.

343
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:06,140

yeah so the winter voice packs they're out right now so

344
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:14,960
originally um these the buttons they are they are limited
they are limited so we're not restocking them again um we

345
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:23,920
did add a hundred more because uh uh we were not expecting
um it to sell out so quick because it was limited edition uh

346
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:33,500
because we're not planning on uh we were too worried that we
might order too many So we are like, okay, 100, we'll add

347
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,300
100 more because they sold out on the first day.

348
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:43,320
But after the 100 is gone, we're not restocking after that
because we're worried about having too much stock.

349
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,460
Because that's what happened with the doggy shirts.

350
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,360
We ordered too many doggy.

351
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,860
We have too many doggy shirts right now.

352
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,960
It is bad.

353
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,220
I don't know.

354
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,200
We're trying to figure out what to do.

355
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:13,940
about it because we might have ordered too many so so um
because of that we are more mindful now how many do you have

356
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:23,040
i'm i'm not gonna say but we might have messed up in
calculation on how hot and demand a hawaiian shirt for dogs

357
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:36,000
would have been i might have i might have miscalculated on
the man they were yes the cat can wear one i have um a

358
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,700
dragon um actually bought one for their cat and wait i'll
show you guys a picture you know i'll chill it right now

359
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:54,500
because we we fucked up i i will take the blame i thought
they would be very popular i'll take i thought they would be

360
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:06,820
very popular so i'll take the blame unfortunately they we
might have sold like i will say i'll let you guys know we

361
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:19,760
might have sold less than 40 of them um and by less than 40
i think we might have sold less than 35

362
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:31,420
So, it's a very, I thought it was, I don't know, I was like,
I really wanted it.

363
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:38,420
So, I thought it was a cool idea, but the world just wasn't
ready for Hawaiian shirts for dogs.

364
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,600
Not like that.

365
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,920
This was, the world just was not ready for this item.

366
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,160
Everything else is doing great.

367
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,480
It's just, this item was just...

368
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:01,120
Way too specific I was not a visionary.

369
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:11,120
I just I just really wanted a Hawaiian shirt for my dog, but
Unfortunately, I was the minority when it came to that.

370
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,500
Yeah, oddly specific.

371
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:22,840
Yeah Wait, I was too ahead of the time Naked 36 let's go.

372
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:35,900
Yeah you know what my dog needs you can be matching with dad
what do you mean um maybe if it's a human yeah the target

373
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:47,520
demographic was unfortunately very narrow um if i want one
everyone wants one i've i've made too many very specific i i

374
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,980
have to think more in general i'll be like what do vtuber
fans want not what does my dog want

375
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,500
That was my problem.

376
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,620
I was like, what do I want for my dog?

377
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,220
That was way too specific.

378
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,000
I need to be like more general in regards to like, would you
be to your fans one?

379
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,220
What do I want?

380
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,260
The thing is, even when I think about like, what would I
want?

381
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,100
So the cross shiblets, they're doing okay.

382
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,040
They're doing okay.

383
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,480
But they were also, they're very specific.

384
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:36,300
items you know um so I just I'm getting too specific with
the items I want because not everyone has Crocs but I'm like

385
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:48,700
but I have Crocs though and that's cool I think it's funny
um but unfortunately the world isn't ready for funny the

386
00:34:48,700 --> 00:35:04,900
world people are still not free yet people are still not
free of crocs are easier to maintain than a damn bed that is

387
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:16,540
also true no whimsy in this world funny does not equal
profit sometimes i will have to admit i understand now why a

388
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:27,140
lot of corpos just automatically go towards acrylic stands
because everyone wants acrylic stands but not everyone wants

389
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:41,720
a Hawaiian shirt for dogs I under there's no there's no way
you can fuck up an acrylic stand but I'm still coming up

390
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:52,160
with good I I've like pivoted my ideas to be more like what
do vtuber fans want instead of like what do I want because I

391
00:35:52,160 --> 00:36:01,100
realize sometimes the things might not be very profitable
because I have some really dumb ideas I think it's funny as

392
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,160
a merch but doesn't necessarily mean that I will sell enough

393
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:21,440
so that's my like 26 like for 2026 um I'm just like the
people were just I'm just too ahead of my time

394
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:35,580
head maybe in in 50 years my items would sell more but for
this year this year was just not it when it comes to like

395
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:48,680
the funny ideas I have um um but yeah 2026 the merch that
we're going for 2026 uh is definitely much more let's see I

396
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,760
would say what's the word 2026 for merch would be more

397
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:11,760
accessible it'll be it'll be more accessible to two dragoons
a bit more mainstream but I won't be like obviously like I'm

398
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,140
not gonna do like you know spamming acrylic stands because I
personally think like um you know acrylic stands they're

399
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:25,340
like you know they're nice to display and collect but I do
want to have more fun things included for you guys like

400
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:33,220
especially some stuff that is like more usable too you can
use as well so I am trying to like balance between the two

401
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:42,180
yeah it does kind of get old so I'm trying to like balance
between the two with like you know uh uh yeah more practical

402
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:50,220
merch too more practical merch as well uh but that's for
that's 2026 we're we're looking in the i have have a couple

403
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:58,640
of merch design being designed and going through like the
manufacturing process of like um well it's not actually

404
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:06,820
being like the drafting phase of it um and i think you guys
are gonna like it if not i might have a lot of them in stock

405
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:19,700
and if not i have failed yet again i am i am not what's the
word i am not Hip with the kids.

406
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,320
I don't understand.

407
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,080
I thought I was relatable.

408
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,900
It's a process.

409
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,980
I thought I was relatable, guys.

410
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,340
I don't understand.

411
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,140
What do you mean there's not enough dogs in the world?

412
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,220
I'm not hip anymore.

413
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,480
It's a learning experience.

414
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,100
Yes, it's a learning.

415
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,480
It was just a Hawaiian shirt for dogs.

416
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,620
That one was my biggest mistake.

417
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,200
It was funny, though.

418
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,260
It was creative, and it was funny.

419
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:03,660
But I will say that was my biggest mistake when it came to
VTuber merch.

420
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,920
Caskey, Cas, thank you for Super Chat.

Uh, just ordered that pet shirt.

430
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,080
My bad.

431
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,800
I was waiting for Payday to get the Hawaiian dog shirt and
then forgot about it.

432
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,780
Can we get pet collars next?

433
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,100
Guys, I can't, I can't do another bad investment.

434
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,400
I have way too many Hawaiian dog shirts.

435
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,100
We can't do this again.

436
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,560
I don't think we have enough dogs.

437
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,100
I,

438
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,860
um season thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i
guess you guys aren't ready for that yet but your kids are

439
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:03,800
gonna love it thank you with a super chat thank you thank
you um make a cat shirt okay the hawaiian shirt is

440
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:10,320
interchangeable with cats you can put the shirt on your cat
i just don't know if your cat's gonna like it but you can

441
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:21,220
put it on your cat um uh morning thank you welcome to tomato
farm welcome welcome I think, though, I think if the

442
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,340
Hawaiian shirts was in pet stores, it'd go crazy.

443
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,780
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

444
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,500
Thank you, thank you.

445
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,600
I think, I think if I could get these shirts in a store,
people will buy.

446
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,860
I just need to, I don't know, I don't know if PetSmart would
allow me.

447
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,440
What if I just, like, go to, like, those, like, pet
conventions to sell my shirt?

448
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:54,400
at a booth i think if i did that maybe i can actually get
get rid of the stock

449
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:05,390
yeah sell them at a flea market that's true i could do that
i should no i shouldn't do that i shouldn't personally do

450
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:19,790
that but someone should um in my in my management team
someone should do that okay i think phone cases are only if

451
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:27,190
you're like I think phone cases will have to be done with a
collab with a phone case company because there's so There's

452
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:36,330
too many different phones now There's way too many iPhones
and there's way too many like A brands for phones now with

453
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:43,650
different look like Different shapes and different camera
placements and everything That's why people would collab

454
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:51,730
with a phone case company because they have a machine That
just prints them one by one so they get an order blank case

455
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,670
and then just print it on and everything

456
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:06,560
Yeah, unless you use the you don't do what Pokemon does
where they have like the the The universal phone cases where

457
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,420
it's literally like a little binder thing, but I hate those
I'm I used to I I remember buying them for the first time

458
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:19,700
because I love the design and I tried it once and like I
hated using I hated using it because it's like it's just so

459
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,280
inefficient.

460
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,180
It feels weird in my hat.

461
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,840
Yeah, it's like a Like, it feels, like, weird in my hand,
and it's so inconvenient.

462
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,150
Because I gotta flip it.

463
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,170
I don't want to flip it.

464
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,830
I just want to, like, get my phone out and then use it.

465
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,740
I want to make those, uh, those card stickers.

466
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,800
Like, uh, but then I'm worried if I do it for, like, credit
cards, like, you know, those credit card stickers where you

467
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,440
can, like, put a sticker on top of your credit card, and
then it's, like, customized?

468
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:11,740
your card if i do that they're just like um is this a fake
card like yeah i don't know i feel like if if you put i feel

469
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:18,520
like people like i feel like random places are gonna start
rejecting your card because when they see it they'll just be

470
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,220
like what the

471
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:36,210
we got a tap to pay but what if you're like in a place that
doesn't have tap and then they like they like you have to

472
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,550
give them the card and they look at the card and be like no

473
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:53,500
i don't want to be like i don't want to be responsible with
that if you're stranded somewhere in the middle of nowhere

474
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:00,240
uh because you're in like the countryside and uh you try to
give them the card to yeah you try to pay for something with

475
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,260
your card but you put a fucking a uh dragon sticker on top
of it and then they look at the card and be like are you

476
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:13,860
fucking with me like we don't accept this are you trying to
scam me and then now you're stuck in the middle of nowhere

477
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:23,340
uh with no money or any like and your phone is dead and
you're like fuck you toky bird i bought your credit card

478
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:30,860
sticker and now i can't go home and then like you gotta stay
you gotta sleep on the side and then hope that your family

479
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,800
and friends filed a missing persons report and

480
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:45,540
missing person report and then they're like this is the last
place like this is the last place their phone um their phone

481
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:57,340
told like said they were at um and this is kidding i just
don't want to be liable i i don't want to be liable for

482
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,300
anything and

483
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:11,110
then and then you have to you have to sleep out on the
streets for like 24 hours maybe longer because you don't

484
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,630
know because i don't know if your family or friends care
enough to file a missing person report they'll just be like

485
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:22,550
they're on a road trip what if you told them you were going
on a road trip so they expected you to be gone for several

486
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:30,750
days so then you're out there in the middle of nowhere um
with no money no phone no way to communicate with all your

487
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,370
loved ones uh because you told them you were going on

488
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,170
I think you thought too hard about this.

489
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,970
Maybe a wallet would be better.

490
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,090
Oh yeah, no, but forgot about the food part.

491
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,880
New Fear Sephalum chapter.

492
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,000
Doki, you might be overthinking this.

493
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,740
But it's a sticker.

494
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,840
You can just peel it off.

495
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:25,440
But what if what if that's like You peel off the sticker But
the part that you need That would like work in the card Was

496
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,700
like Was fucked up like you know how the sticker was too
sticky And it's stuck on the card So you have to scratch on

497
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:37,700
it And after you scratch on it You end up accidentally
scratching the strip Or the chip off

498
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:51,160
Because you're desperate You're so desperate I gotta get the
sticker off and then And then you were You were too

499
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,220
aggressive with the sticker And now your card is unusable

500
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,660

jacquard thank you thank you the fact yoki brought the
scenario in such a high detail that means it's happening

532
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:46,700
somewhere in the multiverse to an unlucky alternate dragon
thank you the super chat thank you thank you okay but then

533
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:55,700
what if a dragon buys the wrong sticker for their card and
then my scenario is gonna happen because they put it on the

534
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:02,360
card, but it covers up the things that shouldn't be covered
because they bought the wrong and then I will be, and it'll

535
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,900
be like, curse you, don't keep bird.

536
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,460
Why didn't you explain more clearly what sticker goes with
what card?

537
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,520
And then I will feel bad.

538
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,560
Please, it's an optional purchase.

539
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:33,020
and then I'll create another I'll create an auntie guys I'll
create I'll say that I think like the most passionate auntie

540
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:44,040
would be a would would be a fan would be an ex fan I will
say that I think like um a lot of like like a lot of like

541
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:53,760
really passionate people who like hate a specific thing will
be a former fan of the thing yeah they are usually the

542
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,640
biggest hated and i don't want that

543
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,380
it's a it's a tale as old as time

544
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:18,100
yeah the greatest hate comes from former love and then you
pay too much for shipping for a fucking sticker exactly

545
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,800
matcha thank you the super chat thank you thank you

546
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:35,340

lot of really fun things 2026 would be pretty interesting um

547
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:46,880
like i said like um a lot of stuff planned for the first
half of the year oh my god i'm gonna be so tired for like

548
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:54,200
i'm gonna be oh well i'm definitely gonna be really tired
for next week because next week the next week and a half the

549
00:50:54,200 --> 00:51:03,760
the last stretch of 2025 uh there's gonna be a special new
year stream um on the 31st for psc countdown there's gonna

550
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,880
be a special psc countdown for new years um um that i've
been planning for a while uh the project has been in the

551
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:18,640
works for the new year thing for like half a year so it's
gonna be very exciting um i hope you guys will this one is

552
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:27,080
the one that i'm super looking forward to the most um the
900k slash uh i will say the 900k is more special than

553
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,400
because i was planning on first combining the 900k
celebration with the christmas celebration but since i

554
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:41,480
realized like a lot of dragons will be spending most of your
time so a lot of dragons have a life and like me i just

555
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:49,480
stream uh a lot they might be spending their christmas with
their family and loved ones so I figured like maybe I should

556
00:51:49,480 --> 00:52:02,400
do a celebration like on a day where people are more free so
the 900k celebration will be uh will be pretty fun as well

557
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,960
um the Christmas one was originally gonna be the 900k
celebration as well but since we're splitting it I gotta

558
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,880
figure out what exactly I do have something planned for
Christmas but it's more so like the gift that plan to give

559
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,580
you guys um but other than that i'm like thinking like oh my
gosh what what do i do

560
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:33,500
we have last land here oh man also today i only ate one meal
today because i'm saving my stomach for tomorrow for the

561
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:42,140
christmas market um because there's like i was watching like
uh tiktoks of the Christmas market and I was like oh that

562
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:49,560
food looks so good and I was like oh I gotta I gotta save my
stomach for tomorrow no you don't understand I ate before

563
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:55,860
the last year I ate before I went last year and I regret it
I was like there's so much food I wanted to eat but I was

564
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:02,440
like I couldn't I couldn't force myself to eat more I
literally had I ordered one dish and I ordered a schnitzel

565
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:29,100
and a schnitzel and and I think like a churro and then I was
full and I'm like why why did I do this I could I'm like no

566
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,960
I could have fit more food in my stomach

567
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:41,180
So, so not, not this time, not this time, I've learned.

568
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,920
Because I didn't, I've never been to a German Christmas
market before.

569
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,940
I didn't, like, research it or anything.

570
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,480
I just thought it was, oh, hey, there's a Christmas market.

571
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,000
I didn't realize there was food there.

572
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,200
So I was like, and then, but it was so good.

573
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,920
It looked so good.

574
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,760
The food looked so fucking good, too.

575
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,560
And I'm so sad, but not today.

576
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,040
Not tomorrow, actually.

577
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,520
Not tomorrow.

578
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,020
I've learned.

579
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,720
But they're going to be overpriced as hell.

580
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,740
I can feel it.

581
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,700
It's obviously.

582
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,160
It's usually a scam.

583
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,560
But like it's a scam that I will participate in.

584
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,120
It's like kind of like I don't understand that.

585
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,640
It's like food trucks too.

586
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,300
Like food trucks are like they're really like you know some
food trucks.

587
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:40,580
um um uh some food trucks they over they're overpriced as
fuck for some mediocre food but you're like i mean i'm here

588
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:50,980
they might look cool but they're just like it don't taste
good uh yeah they charge like premium shit for um uh for

589
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:57,500
something that like might not even taste that good but
you're like well they look good at least yeah like remember

590
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:06,440
when i told you guys the story how like the like they
overcharge you it's good but it's like so expensive too yeah

591
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:14,200
there's some that that's fire but overpriced as fuck i
remember i bought like a katsu sandwich at a food truck that

592
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:22,400
waited like one hour for it you guys remember like for
canada day i was like um i'm gonna go to i'm gonna go check

593
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:30,500

um and then i went there and then I waited in the fucking

594
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:39,820
food truck line for a Katsu sandwich for one hour and then I
had a stream like third like I I was like okay so I have a

595
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:51,240
stream in like um and like two and two and a two and a half
hours or was it in two hours I have a stream in two hours

596
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:57,420
and I was like surely it's not gonna take me that long to
like go to this event in cat for Canada day because the

597
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:03,200
event was like five to ten minutes away and i was like oh
i'm so hungry oh and there's food trucks there too i'm just

598
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:10,500
gonna go there hang out a little bit and then go back just
in time for my stream and i stood in line for one hour for a

599
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:25,760
fucking katsu sandwich it in fact didn't take that long and
it was good i bought more than just a katsu sandwich because

600
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:32,840
at that point i was like was in this line for what that's
their plan that was actually that's so smart now that i

601
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:40,380
think about it that's so fucking smart like you know they
make all these people line up for so fucking long and

602
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:45,200
they're like oh well now that i've been in this line for an
hour i might as well buy more than just a cashew sandwich so

603
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:54,940
i bought a cashew sandwich um the the pork cashew sandwich a
chicken sandwich and also um and also chicken nuggets and a

604
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:05,880
drink because i was like i am ordering food for the next two
days because I already lined up this lot and then I had to

605
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:20,340
wait another 30 minutes for my food to like be given to me I
had I had to wait 30 minutes for the food to be done and

606
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:28,840
then the thing is I had to um when I say like 10 to 15
minutes away it was like by Uber so Um, so like I had to

607
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,620
walk because like all the roads were closed off, you know,
because you know, it's like a event So they closed off all

608
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,020
the roads.

609
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:47,420
So I had to walk like 10 minutes And then Tokyo's no, I'm
very easy to scam that's why like I remember when I was

610
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:53,880
like, okay, okay, I'll finish the story and I'll tell you
why I'm very easy to scam Um, uh, but like I had to walk to

611
00:57:53,880 --> 00:58:04,600
don't say that part um i like walked over to have to walk
like 10 extra minutes to the to find a road the open road

612
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:10,000
and had to wait for the uber because there's an event going
on ubers were very hard to get so i had to wait for the uber

613
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,200
and then get and then like by the time i had to wait another
15 to 20 minutes for an uber to pick me up and take me home

614
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:22,740
and and throughout all that i was just eating my chicken
nuggets i was just like walking over to the road and just

615
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:29,640
eating my chicken nuggets because i was so i was so fucking
hungry at that point anyway I'm very easy to scam I'll tell

616
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:35,720
you guys why um I'm very naive and gullible when it comes to
these things because I'll be like there's no way people will

617
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:46,060
lie like in real life so um I'll remember guys remember that
one time I told you guys like some I got an email being like

618
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:54,540
uh I remember exactly what the email was but um like
something about how like oh you use this song uh we are

619
00:58:54,540 --> 00:59:00,660
gonna sue you if you don't like uh reply back or some shit
and i couldn't tell if it was legit or not and i was like

620
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:12,220
when did i use an illegal song but anyway um when i was
younger when i was in middle school um when i was in middle

621
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:20,420
school um we went to like this city in china like we
traveled like you know i was in china for international

622
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:31,080
school and um and and uh and we were traveling to a
different city um and it was like a village that's like but

623
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:41,000
it was like a tourist village so it was like a traditional
chinese village um that was also a tourist trap so uh

624
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,640
because there would be like boat rides and stuff to see the
cranes and everything and stuff like that and so i wanted to

625
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:57,620
buy a some souvenirs for my parents um um because back then
i loved souvenirs and stuff for like gifts for my family and

626
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:07,140
my for my relatives so i went to a shop i went to a random
shop uh with my one of my friends uh she's korean um this is

627
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:13,880
very important and i was like i saw i don't remember what i
saw but i think i saw a necklace and i was like oh that's so

628
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:20,940
pretty i want this and then like they set the price and i
like for those who know like i was like they set the price.

629
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:21,720
I was like, okay.

630
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,680
I instantly went like, okay.

631
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,920
Like, no hesitation.

632
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,200
And then my friend was like, what the fuck are you doing,
Doki?

633
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,080
I was like, what?

634
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,200
She gave me the price.

635
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,120
It seemed fine.

636
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,700
And then she was like, you're supposed to negotiate.

637
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,520
You're supposed to bargain.

638
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,440
And I'm like, what?

639
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,680
But that's rude.

640
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,340
You're supposed to haggle.

641
01:00:50,440 --> 01:01:05,080
and i'm like i was like that's rude that's shouldn't the
price be final and then you can do and and then my friend

642
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:16,440
was like was like let me haggle for you she's like okay i'm
haggling and then she she brought the price down like 70 or

643
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:28,360
some shit i'm like wait but how would she make profit I was
like are you sure I'm like I'm okay with paying the price

644
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:43,480
she's not gonna make money I was like are you sure though oh
but what if I don't want to scam her literally right now she

645
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:51,780
was the lady was trying to scam me like I was way too
trusting I still am.

656
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,960

But then I always forget to get work done.

I somehow, somehow, always, the last couple of days, don't
get the work done.

748
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:22,750
Because I somehow be like, well, if I'm not going to get the
work done, I'll just play like two to three games of Rivals.

three games of rivals it's a problem it really is a problem
