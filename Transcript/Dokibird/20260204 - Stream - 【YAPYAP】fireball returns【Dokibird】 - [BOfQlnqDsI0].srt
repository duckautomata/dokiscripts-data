1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
Like, everyone can hear you.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,300
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,420
Well, technically, sort of.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,240
Sort of.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,140
What about you?

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,200
What about you?

7
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,780
I'm not about you.

8
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,200
Yeah, whenever we do, whenever I do collabs, I just go
straight into no waiting room.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,040
It was quiet.

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,380
Oh, I'm going to talk into the microphone really close.

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,060
Okay.

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,460
If you hit escape, it says color, and you can change your
character's color.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,980
But I know you guys are all green.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,880
Wait, why are you eating green?

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,420
Oh my god.

16
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:32,540
Oh, no.

17
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,580
I can do another one now.

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,140
No, no, I deserve green.

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,100
Wait, we can have different colors?

20
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,280
Oh, wait, what color am I?

21
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,440
What's my color?

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,160
I'm green.

23
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,280
I'm green.

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,500
You are red right now, Doki.

25
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,120
I'm red.

26
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,380
Oh, wait, that fits me.

27
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,120
Okay, I'm giving I'm trying to give you guys, I want to give
you guys little hats.

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,820
Give me a sec.

29
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,820
I'm putting little hats on us right now.

30
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,120
Is my mic really quiet though?

31
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,060
Let me know if I'm like, you know, you're mostly okay.

32
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,880
And I can also turn you up, so it's fine.

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,660
Turned you up a little bit.

34
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,140
Well, I'm putting little hats on us.

35
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,480
Just tiny little hats.

36
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,420
There we go.

37
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,920
Mimi, could you say something so I can chest your audio?

38
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,800
Hello, yep, yep, yep.

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,820
Okay, okay, I can go.

40
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,060
Yeah, I think everybody needs to be turned up.

41
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,920
I appreciate it.

42
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,040
We don't have our magic wands yet.

43
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,800
No, not tongue.

44
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,980
I feel like...

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,320
I'm gonna be surprised if it registers any of us.

46
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,940
But I don't know why it's registering Spanish.

47
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,720
Hola.

48
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,900
La biblioteca.

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,800
I don't know.

50
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,040
I'm gonna switch over if you guys are okay.

51
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,140
Okay, me too.

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,020
Me.

53
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,680
I...

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Wait, where's the magic...

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,380
There's like magic wines here.

56
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,460
There's no privacy here, man.

57
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,180
Fireballs!

58
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,400
Oh!

59
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,080
Hi!

60
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,600
How do I get my magic wine out?

61
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,700
They're not...

62
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,160
Look here.

63
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,020
It's not a dream.

64
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,640
Yeah.

65
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, here you go.

66
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,360
Yeah, that's true.

67
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,580
Yeah, but if we were all on YouTube, nobody would have seen
it.

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:14,920
Fireball.

69
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,420
Wind magic.

70
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Wind.

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,700
They can just, you know, figure that there was probably
something wrong.

72
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Wait.

73
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,180
Up dog.

74
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,580
And it, like, worked on you.

75
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,480
What?

76
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,840
It's called...

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,100
Watch this!

78
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,900
Tempest!

79
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,640
Boom!

80
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,560
It's up here.

81
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,700
There's like wands here.

82
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,500
There's like wands here.

83
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,680
Free wands.

84
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,100
Yeah, yeah.

85
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,640
Free wands.

86
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,640
Look, watch this.

87
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,700
Oh, he got one.

88
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,720
Up dog!

89
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,360
Woo!

90
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,660
Yeah.

91
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,420
It's my new magic spell, up dog.

92
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,340
How do you get a stick from the tree?

93
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,160
Oh, I broke up.

94
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,300
I think we took all this.

95
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,960
Oh, there should be one that's broke.

96
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,980
There should be more.

98
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,940
sticks, right?

99
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, you can bump...

100
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,040
Cute!

101
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,820
Uppies!

102
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,400
Contract, explode enemies with piss.

103
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,360
Look at that!

104
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,700
Mimi can't afford a magic wand!

105
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,640
If it's magical piss, it is.

106
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,800
Oh, wait.

107
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,320
Are these like our con... Oh, are these our goals?

108
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,860
Because it's like a dungeon, right?

109
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,260
Maybe they're like more cooperative than a duel.

110
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,780
Yeah, it's like a dungeon crawler type deal.

111
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,800
Oh, thank God.

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,960
I wasn't looking forward to getting, like, bullied again.

113
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,660
I mean, there is friendly fire.

114
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,700
Like, Tempest.

115
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,540
Okay.

116
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,760
Tempest.

117
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,860
Oh, shit.

118
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,740
Arrow.

119
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,060
Tempest.

120
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,060
Aerial.

121
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,940
Updang.

122
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,060
Oh, I'm flying.

123
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,940
Oh, you can't, there is fall damage, guys.

124
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,420
Everybody, there is fall damage.

125
00:03:59,520 --> 00:03:59,940
Oh, wait.

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,780
You can get, like, prettier wands.

127
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
You can get, like, special wands here later on.

128
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,260
Ooh, a mystery egg.

129
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,240
I want a mystery egg.

130
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,820
Wait, there's a bottled fairy.

131
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,260
We can eat it.

132
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,920
We can eat the fairy.

133
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,580
What if the mystery egg is a cute pet?

134
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,060
Oh, yeah, that's true.

135
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,500
What if we can kill him and take his stuff?

136
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,420
There's four of...

137
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,140
There's five of us and one of him.

138
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,820
Well, four of us with wands.

Did anyone read what our contract wanted us to do?

183
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,500
We have to explode.

184
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
That's fine with piss and steal at least two gold.

185
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,000

Oh, the green man.

318
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,160

We're missing one person in this group.

334
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,830
Life is probably working and doing it all.

She's like that one person in the group project that does
all our work and we're just chilling.

341
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,710
in the corridor.

342
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,870

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,970
He simply doesn't seem to like us.

351
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,850

352
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,590

The guy was trying to sell that for four gold or something.

361
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,610
The mystery egg.

362
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,930

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,010
Did you steal my Goonads?

368
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,310
Who did that?

369
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,490

What did you...

425
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,010
You committed a crime, man.

What is she doing on your screen?

700
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,470
She's currently under the ground.

A bomb!

780
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,890
Start the extraction!

No, it's time, it's time, so the moment they get hit.

784
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,630
We thought it was safety, it was not safety.

785
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,410
What do we do?

786
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,610
What do we do?

787
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,990

us back to the main base.

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,580
There's nothing here.

838
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,120

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:14,560
Oh.

894
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,760
Well, I'll get into the tornado.

895
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,840
Oh, never mind.

896
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:21,640
I mean, your tornado's sort of like, you know, it wasn't me
and not me, you know, so...

897
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,420
That's true.

898
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,940
Should we find Limeo extract?

899
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,420
I'm pretty sure she can find her own extraction.

900
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,360
Can we extract?

901
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,640
I think we got it.

902
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,200
I think, honestly, I think the goal is we should figure out
where the extractions because there's a higher chance that

903
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,560
she'll...

904
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:45,760
live and we won't oh there's over here oh there she is this
arrow there's something super valuable up here arrow where

how do you

907
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,700
That did not sound like the scream of victory.

908
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,260
Wait, what was that?

909
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,980
Wait, Lymo's dead!

910
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,300
Wait, how did she die?

911
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,440
She just fell on me.

912
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,460
Wait, where's the gold?

913
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,520
Where's the gold?

914
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,940
She said there was a gold thing up there.

915
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,760
Do you see it?

916
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,960
She broke it, but it was like six.

917
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,020
And then she screamed.

918
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,640
Oh, oh shit!

919
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,360
It's okay, it's okay.

920
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,280
It's still five minutes left.

921
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,160
He doesn't, it's a ceasefire.

922
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,140
Okay, where are we going to keep distracting?

923
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,600
Oh my gosh, no, I thought.

924
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,140
Oh, okay, okay.

925
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,160

Updog.

928
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,240

929
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Wait, where is it?

930
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:53,420
Updog.

931
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,500

932
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,400

We have 87 gold now.

998
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,070
We should treat ourselves to something.

999
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:22,770
Oh, my God.

1000
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,210
We need a revive potion.

1001
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,430
One of our quests is to burn things, so I think we should
all get torches.

1002
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:28,270
Oh, that's true.

1003
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:28,750

They're also, they're available for free in the castle
rooms.

Who's the cook in the team?

1010
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,450
Snuffy loves doing magic spells.

1011
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,470
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,810
She's already, like, you know, brewing.

1013
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:47,170
She's like a witch.

1014
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:51,430
I'm surprised you don't have a, you don't have a witch
outfit.

1015
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,110
I know you have a sorcerer.

1016
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:53,450
I really do.

1017
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,190
No, you have a sorcerer.

1018
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,210
Wait, you're a wizard?

1019
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,190
Wait, I'm, yeah.

1020
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:02,110
Wait, I need some sort of purple balls.

1021
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,490
What is this?

1022
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:05,670
Are these the gonad?

1023
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,850
What are these purple- I don't think we have the ingredient?

1024
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,210
Purple blood.

1025
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:15,930
What did you do?

1026
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,190
You're nerdy?

1027
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:24,270
What did you- What- Why do you sound like that, Lop?

1028
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,170
What did you do?

1029
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,410
I drank a potion!

1030
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,950
What- what potion did you drink?

1031
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,530
Oh my- I wanted a potion!

1032
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,110
What potion did you make?

1033
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:35,710
Nothing!

1034
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,750
What did you have?

1035
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,710
I gave you a floor potion.

1036
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,570
Wait, was it a stamina one?

1037
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,770
Don't drink flakes on the floor.

1038
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,370
I literally said nerd potion and it was underneath the
cauldron, so I drank it.

1039
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:54,490
The first rule, you never drink stuff on the floor.

1040
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,670
Snubby, there are some gonads here.

1041
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,570
Did you want them?

1042
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,570
I don't know what they're for.

1043
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:01,810
Is there more?

1044
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,650

Yay.

1340
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,110
The last, like, I'm like, last scene.

1341
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:32,770
It's like, where is the, where did little Timmy jump in the
well?

Yeah.

1345
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,930
All things considered, I think we lost.

1346
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:46,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got to keep our money.

1347
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,330
We did lose all our money.

1348
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:49,390
We did it in the end.

1349
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,430
I got your wand, but I couldn't get to the extraction.

1350
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:52,070
I'm sorry.

1351
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:53,150
Sorry, no, that's okay.

1352
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:58,430
No, I was watching a jokie, and she and Mint couldn't talk
to each other.

1353
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:02,290
And when you resurrected me and Mimi, I couldn't hear you at
all.

1354
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,750
That seems to happen a lot in these games.

1355
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:05,290
It's okay.

1356
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,070
Yeah, I was trying to tell you I had your wand.

1357
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:10,370
Oh, okay, I literally ran away with my wand.

1358
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:12,290
I thought it was like a mimic.

1359
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:13,590
I thought there was like one of them.

1360
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:16,710

communicate.

Oh, look at her zero dollars.

1459
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,490

01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,090

1467
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:03,450

01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:08,830
The frog was our passive income.

1473
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:12,270
She got rid of our passive income.

1474
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,110
Betrayer.

1475
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:16,890

1480
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:23,550
We lost our passive income.

1481

I'm happy with my standard wand.

1488
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:40,950
Alright, let's go.

1489
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:41,770
Activating.

1490
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,470
If anybody wants the purple one, I can give it to them too.

1491
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:45,690
I'm sad.

1492
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:46,190

1493
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:49,790
Hop dog.

Hop dog.

1495
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:52,030
Hop dog.

1496
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:58,810
We lost our passive income.

1497
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:01,230
What's the point?

1498
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,430
Look at another one.

1499
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:05,850
He was also spitting money.

1500
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:06,390
Tempest.

1501
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,050
Bigness tongue.

1503
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:15,370

1504
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:17,390
All right.

1505
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:18,590
heading upstairs.

1506
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,070
This is little money.

01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:25,890

01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:29,330

1510
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:29,990
I don't know.

1511
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:30,890

1512
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:32,190
Ignis tongue.

1513
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:33,490

1514
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:36,490
Not doing anything.

Our $50.

1577
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:45,950

Holy crap.

1586
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,690
They definitely knew we died, right?

1587
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,410
They should know that.

1588
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:01,330
Sorry.

1589
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,490
That's okay.

1590
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:06,850
There are places to hide, but it's tough.

1591
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:08,750
Oh my god.

1592
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:09,490

We need to get to the exit.

1597
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,150
There's way more than what I was used.

1598
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:21,930

I wonder who did that.

1712
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:11,750
I wonder who did that.

1713
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:12,870
What's that mean?

1714
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:13,950
Aerial.

1715
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:14,790
Aerial.

1716
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,730
I'm heading upstairs.

1717
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:20,210
That's where the big money's at.

1718
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:21,850
Big money.

1719
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:24,890
Looking for a torch.

1720
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:27,030
You're for the big mula.

1721
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:29,650
Tempest.

1722
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,070
Oh, there's an eyeball, guys.

1723
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:33,110
Be nice.

1724
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:34,870
There's an eyeball over there.

1725
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,490
You looked at me.

1726
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,470
Maybe he likes my music.

1727
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:43,930
Oh, he's tiny!

1728
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:45,870
Tempest!

1729
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:48,110
Oh, wait, he's gone.

1730
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:49,070
Oh, okay, cool.

1731
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:52,410
He was so embarrassed by his small size.

1732
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,750
It was above average, man.

1733
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:56,970
Don't shy-size-shame him.

1734
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:02,190
Well, it's messed up size-shaming that poor eye.

1735
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:03,810
Oh my god, he's back, he's back.

1736
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:04,990
Keep size-shaming him.

1737
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:08,810
Oh.

1738
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:10,770
Oh.

1739
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:11,190
Oh.

1740
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:12,670
But who's down here?

1741
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:13,930
She's a really dark chamber.

1742
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:15,310
Hi.

1743
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:16,230
Hi.

1744
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:18,730
Tempest.

1745
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,490
I'm looking for a source of light.

1746
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:22,690
Me too.

1747
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:26,750
I'm trying to figure out where to go.

1748
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:28,610
Wait, who's over there?

1749
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,020
Hello?

1750
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,000
I'm scared.

1751
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:35,740
Hi.

1752
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:36,280
Hi.

1753
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,100
I go down.

1754
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,140
There's no down.

1755
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:41,580
There's no down.

1756
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:42,340
Where are the doors?

1757
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,080
I don't know.

1758
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,560
I'm- it's so dark.

1759
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,060
I have no light source.

1760
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,120
Oh, hey guys.

1761
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:48,940
I think here, I think.

1762
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,460
I tried to go down, but I can't see shit.

1763
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,400
Are there stairs here?

1764
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:56,160
Crazy.

1765
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,040
There's no stairs.

1766
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,040
It's just- it's just down- Yeah.

1767
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,700
I think there's stuff over here.

1768
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,740
The stairs here just goes back to the upstairs.

1769
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:07,800
Yeah.

1770
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:12,040
I think this is a dead end, guys.

1771
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,060

It's okay.

1918
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:41,990

1923
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:51,150
Is there anything else around?

1924
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:52,610

We're all five of us to share.

1971
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:02,220
That's why I'm daddy's favorite.

1972
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,340
Wait, there's...

1973
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,240
Can I have a fire one?

1974
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,760
The grotesque one on his back.

1975
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,600
That's the cheapest, too.

1976
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:18,880
more frogs i want to fire one it's super expensive oh oh
nice frogs are slowly puking out money see look at that we

1979
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:43,380
items to sell.

1980
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,760
I am going to sell the mystery egg.

1981
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:49,240
And then one of my feathers.

1982
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:53,410
How did I make it move?

1983
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:54,510
Alright.

1984
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:55,270
Take what move?

1985
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:56,710
The thing.

1986
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:57,950
Did you figure out how to make the thing move?

1987
01:36:58,750 --> 01:36:59,230
What's the thing?

1988
01:36:59,330 --> 01:36:59,930
It was pitch.

1989
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:00,950
But it's confusing.

1990
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:01,730
I think.

1991
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:02,530
Oh, no.

1992
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,690
It was like putting the bowl in the middle of the hole.

1993
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:07,270
But it looked really contrived.

1994
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:08,950
We didn't sell some more stuff.

1995
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:11,170
And we should be able to afford the fire wand.

1996
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:12,790
We're selling some more stuff downstairs.

1997
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:14,270
I love the final one.

1998
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:14,610
Yeah, yeah.

1999
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:16,930
You guys want to, do you guys like this wand?

2000
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:18,010
Or I can sell it too.

2001
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:18,390
I don't.

2002
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:19,450
What is that?

2003
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:21,290
You should keep your special one.

2004
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:22,470
Wait, keep a special one.

2005
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:23,610
Yeah, you should keep it.

2006
01:37:24,690 --> 01:37:25,050
Special.

2007
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:27,050
I just realized your hat lights up when you speak.

2008
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:27,750
That's cute.

2009
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:29,430
Oh, look at those.

2010
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:30,070
You're right.

2011
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:31,090
That's so cute.

2012
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:31,890
Fill containers.

2013
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:34,270
Oh, wait, we might, we need to get the containers.

2014
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:37,450
We're pissed because you get 250 chaos.

2015
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:40,890
I like the wizard from Marwinder leader.

2016
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,970
Dude, I want to buy the blessed wand, okay?

2017

2018
01:37:55,430 --> 01:38:05,730
potions right like who needs potions what do are we we don't
need any of this like it feels like the potions fucking suck

2019
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:13,470
because the cool down period seems like really really it's
like one use and like the duration is not that great.

2020
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:16,410
Oh, wait.

2021
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:17,950
Did you guys sell stuff already?

2022
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:19,810
I sold.

2023
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:22,350
We sold for the fire wand.

2024
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:23,670
Oh, okay.

2025
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:25,450

Please take my mushroom.

2027
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:30,870
I can sell my wand if you guys want a different wand.

2028
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:33,810
I can sell.

2029
01:38:34,190 --> 01:38:35,950
I can sell the clothes on my back.

2030
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:36,230
Yeah, yeah.

2031
01:38:36,230 --> 01:38:37,430
I don't want everyone to have a wand.

2032
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:40,970
It's a mine.

2033
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:41,710
It's a mine.

2034
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:42,390
So.

2035
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:43,510
Yeah, yeah.

2036
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:44,610
That seems strong.

2037
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:48,350
The thing is, you can't really control where...

2038
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:49,710
Oh, yeah, you have to talk when you're...

2039
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:52,730
Yeah, you have to be like, Baa, Baa, Baa, Baa, Baa, Baa,
Baa.

2040
01:38:52,730 --> 01:38:56,930
Are those sword guys really invincible?

2041
01:38:57,610 --> 01:38:58,470
I don't know.

2042
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:00,690
I can't kill them.

2043
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:01,770
With the wind at least.

2044
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:03,150
Yeah, yeah.

2045
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:05,990
Wait, do we have...

2046
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:06,190
Oh, it.

2047
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:08,050
Are we ready?

2048
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:09,350
What else is arcane magic?

2049
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:10,450
Dog.

2050
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:11,290
Dog.

2051
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:12,030
Dog.

2052
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:22,110
I think it's only three dogs Yeah, we can only have three
dogs per person I'm extracting, but then I'm also gonna go

2053
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:26,950

01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:03,030
Oh, wait, no, this is where we started.

2097
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:09,610

I say dollars and it thinks...

2114
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:50,030
I don't know what counts as arcane magic, so I haven't been
able to do complete one of the contracts.

2115
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:57,070
I think this is a revive room.

2116
01:42:58,790 --> 01:43:00,050
Oh, wait, this is a...

2117
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:01,630

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2119
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:05,150
So we need to go there.

Yeah, I totally...

2121
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:09,330
I know the flame one is pretty bad.

2122
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:10,430
It doesn't really do much.

2123
01:43:10,730 --> 01:43:10,790

Oh, there's another portal here.

2140
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:43,550

2180
01:46:06,010 --> 01:46:06,970

2182
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:11,650

Okay, okay, okay, okay, we're figuring this out.

2187
01:46:22,590 --> 01:46:23,670
Can you go kill the eyeball?

2188
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:24,910
He just keeps like...

01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:27,310
Um, I really only just have Matt.

2190
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:29,870

Okay, yeah, me too.

2192
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:34,650
The mimic kind of came in, straightened a bunch and then
left, I guess.

2193
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:37,070
The eyeball and...

2194
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:38,730
Just wants to be included.

2195
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:40,530
And then we're like, get out!

2196
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:42,950
Yeah, I have two eyeballs.

01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:45,170
Oh, they do hurt.

2198
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:46,850
They just got a lot of fire.

2199
01:46:46,930 --> 01:46:48,690
They only hurt when...

2200
01:46:48,690 --> 01:46:48,950
Oh, wait, wait.

2201
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:49,430

2238
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:09,300

01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,580
We found the Revive Place before.

2242
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:14,180

2243
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:14,780

Oh, wait, wait.

Oh, wait.

2250
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:18,860
No, this is the...

2251
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:21,000
Remember, we did our little TP Crystal Dance here?

2252
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:26,400
Yes, but the extraction point was near one of the crystals.

2253
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:29,100
Okay, this one, north?

2254
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,180
Maybe this one.

2255
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:32,040
This one says north.

2256
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:33,860
The other one is...

2257
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:37,220
North.

2258
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:38,340

They're both north?

2260
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:40,640
They're both north.

2261
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:44,740
Then where does the other crystal go?

2262
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,960
Wait, where's the other...

2263
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,560

2267
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,120

Areas.

2280
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:50,460
She was outside the circle.

2281
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:52,240
She was out.

2282
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:13,890

circle and I said Ariel and pushed you for I pushed you

2284
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:33,470
further away Literally, I crashed Like, Mint used her spell
And then it just instantly crashed my game But I guess I

2285
01:52:33,470 --> 01:52:39,110
kept all my items Also, Mint, why didn't you use your spell
in the circle?

2303
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:21,870

01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:41,990
What is Luxana?

2313
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:43,970
It's so sweet.

2314
01:53:44,230 --> 01:53:46,370
I'll miss my little baby.

2315
01:53:46,710 --> 01:53:46,910

2316
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:48,490

2317
01:53:50,450 --> 01:53:50,810
Whoa.

2318
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:53,010
We had so many frauds.

2319
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:53,570
Oh my god.

2320
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:55,330
I forget to pick up the gold that they leave.

2321
01:53:55,450 --> 01:53:55,910
Yeah, yeah.

2322
01:53:56,410 --> 01:54:01,830
Money, money, money, money, money, money.

2323
01:54:02,030 --> 01:54:03,350
Must be funny.

2324
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:04,930
Grabana.

2325
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:10,690
How do I, like, chuck people away?

2326
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:12,370
I chucked her away one time.

2327
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:14,550
Grabana.

2328
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:16,610
Whoa.

2329
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:20,850
Yeah, but I saw, like, the first time I used it, I chucked
someone away.

2330
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:22,590
I freaking have the worst.

2331
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:23,630
Grabana.

2332
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:25,970
Wait, that's the one I have.

2333
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:32,050
Oh Wait, that means we can grab someone like closer to us.

Grabana the splints

2338
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:54,190

Oh, it's so cool.

I do not grab the eye.

2348
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:55,660
Do not grab the eye.

2349
01:55:56,780 --> 01:55:58,600
Might not have been the smartest thing I've done.

2350
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:02,680
There is an eye downstairs, guys.

2351
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:04,660
You can hear more of your beautiful voice.

2352
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,040
If you, like, yell at objects.

2353
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:07,480
It's great.

2354
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:07,860
I will.

2355
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:08,460
Come on, Nimi.

2356
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:10,840
We're moving to the next room.

2357
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:11,580
Oh, there's the eyeball.

2358
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:12,680
Oh, no.

2359
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:13,440
Oh, no.

2360
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:14,140
Grabana!

2361
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:14,900
Grabana!

2362
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:16,680
Oh, don't let her get me!

2363
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,880
There is an eye right behind us.

2364
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:20,380
Luxana.

2365
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,200
Oh, Luxana is, like, light.

2366
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:25,680
Oh, okay.

2367
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:26,220
Don't do that.

2368
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:26,960
Grabana.

2369
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:27,820
That makes sense.

2370
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:28,760
Lux, we've light, I guess.

2371
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:29,440
Grabana.

2372
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:32,840
That's right, dodged!

2373
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:37,160
See, I learned from Snuffy's mistake and moved step to the
left.

2374
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:38,260
Oh, that was expensive.

2375
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:42,060
I don't know, I like this.

2376
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:43,780
There's so many big vowels.

2377
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:46,240
Rabana!

2378
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:48,060
No, no, no!

2379
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:49,040
Rabana!

2380
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:53,140
Making so much money!

2381
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:53,700
Yay!

2382
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:58,080
We're hard workers, guys.

2383
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:01,500
Oh, there's a slime.

2384
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:02,920
Oh, we don't have the...

2385
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:05,660
Did anyone buy the gross test one?

2386
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:07,080
Because we're supposed to pee on it.

2387
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:08,260
No.

2388
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:11,100
Oh, no peeing on the slime, I guess.

2389
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:13,720
Not this time.

2390
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:15,860
I got something expensive.

2391
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:17,560
Tempest.

2392
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:19,860
Aerial.

2393
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:23,680
Oh, guys, you can't push the slime.

2394
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:25,920
There is a...

2395
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:26,820
Where is the slime?

2396
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:28,480
She's up here with me.

2397
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:29,360
No.

2398
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:31,480
But, like, you can't push.

2399
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,660
Apparently, the slime is unpushable.

2400
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:39,080
Oh, I could just walk past it, I guess.

2401
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,580
Yeah?

2402
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:40,680
Yeah.

2403
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:41,960
Let me break this wall and go over there.

2404
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:42,460
Yeah.

2405
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:43,620
All right.

2406
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:44,160
There's nothing.

2407
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:45,620
How do I get up top?

2408
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:48,040
Oh, oh.

2409
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:48,760
There's a dragon?

2410
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:49,580
Far oil?

2411
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:50,100
Oh!

2412
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:51,140
What?

2413
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:52,860
I just saw someone get abducted.

2414
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:53,660
I saw someone.

2415
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:54,180

Oh, my gosh.

2430
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:56,920
Astralize are scary.

2431
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:00,980
Oh, right behind you or right in front of us?

2432
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:02,460
Right, right this way.

2433
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:04,080
And there's also a giant slime cube.

2434
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:06,040
Oh, he came back?

2435
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:06,940
That's what was going on with that.

2436
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:07,720
Yeah.

2437
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:11,960
So... This is exactly where we came.

2438
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:12,860
We need to go forward.

2439
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:13,960
Oh, okay.

2440
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,520
I thought that...

2441
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,300
I thought forward was where we came from.

2442
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:20,060
Oh, no, I'm lost.

2443
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:29,220

area Yeah, I mean what will we do about you?

2444
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,920
Maybe genuinely my sense of direction maybe maybe we'd be
dead honestly.

2445
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:42,260
We could just be dead Oh, I don't Oh, that door was
unopened.

2446
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:43,540
Oh, there's another sword guy here.

2447
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:46,700
Oh, that's new Yeah, this is all new.

2448
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:54,360

2450
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:13,850
oh and i said grabana and then i said did it grab him and
then i got grabbed and then

2451
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:20,840
yeah sometimes the spells don't work in our favor

2452
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:27,060
Oh, shit, the mimic!

2453
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:33,890
Was it a snuffy mimic?

2454
02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:35,090
I have no...

2455
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:35,810
Are you alive?

2456
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:44,990
Oh, hey, Nivi, I thought you...

2457
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:46,270
I'm good, I'm good.

2458
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:56,750
Because things just don't...

2459
02:01:56,750 --> 02:02:01,550
Okay, the fact that the gesture is a one-shot is pretty
fucked up, I will say.

2460
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:02,650
I know.

2461
02:02:02,990 --> 02:02:06,030
You were like our test subject, too.

2462
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:09,650
You were like, we're like, oh, I wonder what happens if you
get crashed.

2463
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:10,870
I

2464
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:21,750
Think maybe I wasted money on that shitty ass grab on a one

2465
02:02:35,850 --> 02:02:39,210
Where did snuffy go where was she by herself?

2466
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:40,770
Oh

2467
02:02:47,370 --> 02:02:54,690
My god the jukes of the century, oh, she doesn't know they
can open doors She doesn't know they can open doors.

2468
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:56,230
Oh, she made it back with them.

2469
02:02:56,710 --> 02:02:57,290
She made it back.

2470
02:02:57,330 --> 02:02:59,770
Oh, that's Wait, that's not Nimi.

2471
02:02:59,970 --> 02:03:06,390

2501
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:32,630

02:05:04,070 --> 02:05:05,230
Pretty, yeah, it is.

2515
02:05:05,470 --> 02:05:10,610
They probably expect you to use, like, the, the, um, the
potions and stuff.

2516
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:11,950
We're just raw dogs.

02:05:11,950 --> 02:05:12,690
Yeah, we're just raw.

2518
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:15,610
Yeah, we're like, we just sell all our ingredients for more
wines.

2519
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:17,210
We're like, we don't need potions.

2520
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:19,130

There's an eyeball behind you?

2652

It's okay, I have a pillar, we'll see.

2653

02:11:47,490 --> 02:11:47,930

She's still okay.

2668
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:51,630
She's still healthy.

2669
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:53,690
She doesn't have to go to the hospital yet.

2670
02:11:53,950 --> 02:11:54,350
There's an eyeball.

2671
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:55,110
Yeah, yeah.

2672
02:11:55,110 --> 02:11:56,050
We have to pill her, though.

2673
02:11:56,150 --> 02:11:57,950
Stay underneath her.

2674
02:11:59,090 --> 02:11:59,690
It's a fish.

2675
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:00,750
It's a fish now.

2676
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:03,310
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

Oh, there's a guy behind us?

2680
02:12:07,770 --> 02:12:08,470
I can't hear her.

2681
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:08,850
Oh, no.

2682
02:12:09,090 --> 02:12:11,630
Okay, I can turn her into a fish and then it'll reset it.

2683
02:12:12,450 --> 02:12:13,450
Does that work?

2684
02:12:13,650 --> 02:12:14,070

02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:12,350
You have to...

2883
02:23:12,350 --> 02:23:13,030

Yeah, these dance lessons are paying off, guys.

2892
02:23:31,130 --> 02:23:46,830

a good day Bye bye guys Bye bye

2893
02:23:50,310 --> 02:24:02,430
Oh my god that's a John Asmint Oh my god my all my little
hats They're wizards poofed It's like the Jedi.

2894
02:24:03,910 --> 02:24:06,190
It's like the fucking Jedi.

2895
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:11,710
They all poofed and all they did was leave their little
wizard hats.

2896
02:24:12,190 --> 02:24:13,050
That was fun.

2897
02:24:13,410 --> 02:24:16,750
I think like it's definitely a hard game.

2898
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:17,430
It was...

2899
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:20,330
The game.

2900
02:24:20,750 --> 02:24:24,890
The game is definitely pretty hard because it's like...

2901
02:24:24,890 --> 02:24:26,430
I don't know if you can kill the enemies.

2902
02:24:26,630 --> 02:24:27,370
That's the thing.

2903
02:24:27,850 --> 02:24:31,110
I have no idea if the enemies are...

2904
02:24:31,130 --> 02:24:39,110
killable because we kept fucking yelling spells at them and
they're either like incredibly tanky or like or like you

2905
02:24:39,110 --> 02:24:44,030
just gotta like use it as like use as a way to push them
away yeah

2906
02:24:47,570 --> 02:24:54,350
probably can like phasmo i feel like we haven't even seen
like the extent of how many enemies there are in this game

2907
02:24:54,350 --> 02:25:00,830
but that was really fun i'm glad i uh i organized this
collab because i saw a lot of videos about yapp yapp and so

2908
02:25:00,830 --> 02:25:06,890
i was just like i want to i want to check this out with the
sloppy sisters yeah i don't think they should but i think i

2909
02:25:06,890 --> 02:25:11,310
think if we i guess like because they're like oh we just
kill the monsters and there's no threat you know but that

2910
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:21,490
jester was fucking crazy that that jester the fact that he
is like a one-shot i was like are you what the like how why

2911
02:25:21,490 --> 02:25:34,950
is this guy one shot like what can we do and he's so big
he's so fucking big on my screen like i feel like um but i

2912
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:43,970
think the con i like the concept i like that it's like it's
basically repo but like you break things instead of um you

2913
02:25:43,970 --> 02:25:50,630
break things instead of trying to salvage stuff so i don't
know i think that's a cool concept and the that you can yell

2914
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:56,110
random spells i hope they add more wands to her magic spells
and stuff there should be a lot of fun things you can do

2915
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:06,660
i think the one should more i think more wands and more
abilities would be pretty nice you know we haven't done this

2916
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:14,740
in a long time but let's super wait do i have super chats
today i was gonna say super chat reading and i was like wait

2919
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:46,780
time to go to the beach it is less crowded if you think

Um.

2936
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:48,520
That was weird.

2937
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:49,260
That was weird.

2938
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:50,640
I didn't... I was like...

2939
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:52,100
Where did it go?

2940
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,540
Where did it go?

2941
02:28:57,840 --> 02:29:05,680
there we go also shout out to neemie for making us the
wizard hats uh she provided the little wizard hat as a

2942
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:16,360
little asset for all of us so shout out to her um um she was
playing it on max fov too we were like because apparently um

2943
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:26,480
the uh the the fucking f like the i guess like it was really
bad for people who have motion sickness and i was just like

2944
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:33,600
we were like all of us had like different fovs mine was like
i didn't really like the f of the default fov uh i know like

2945
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:40,720
mint set hers to 70 the default was 90 i put mine at 80 and
then we were asking me and she's like mine's maxed out and i

2946
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:55,100
was like wow she wanted to see everything yeah um oh my gosh
i'm like all over the place right now like i have so many

2947
02:29:55,100 --> 02:30:02,200
deadlines and so many behind the scenes things i am so
stressed out at the moment because uh february is hell month

2948
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:09,520
you think this week there is like the end of the event no
next week we have our pubg blind spot sponsor tournament um

2949
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:17,360
they contacted me uh to help with i guess like being the
face of their first official na tournament um because they

2950
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:22,840
do have another tournament in korea as well that's going
around the same time but they wanted uh me to be like the

2951
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:30,800
face of their first the public na tournament uh so huge
shout out to pubg blindspot for sponsoring me i was a little

2952
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:38,400
nervous about it because i was just like it's a lot of work
because it was like we told them like it is a lot because it

2953
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:45,820
is during we have another thing next week as well before the
pubg tournament as well as the anniversary and end of and

2954
02:30:45,820 --> 02:30:52,680
and dad's birthday and so like um they helped a lot with
like making a lot all the graphics and the assets but riding

2955
02:30:52,680 --> 02:31:00,660
the pubg one on it's going to be a multi-stream for the
announcement um the announcement is going to be a

2956
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:05,140
multi-stream because apparently there's like a twitch thing
there's going to be like i think twitch drops going on so

2957
02:31:05,140 --> 02:31:14,840
they wanted uh they wanted there to be on twitch but i did
tell them like oh uh my main audience is on youtube uh and

2958
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:19,440
so they asked if we could multi-stream so i was like yeah
it's fine it's an announcement so i don't mind

2959
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:27,220
multi-streaming and the announcement just the announcement
stream so basically it's going to have all the details of

2960
02:31:27,220 --> 02:31:33,460
the tournament itself like who's participating the
tournament i haven't fully confirmed my team i'm the last

2961
02:31:33,460 --> 02:31:38,640
person to fully confirm my team because i had someone drop
out last minute today because they had like something else

2962
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:44,920
going on during tournament day so i was like oh okay i gotta
find and i have to like i have to find someone like by the

2963
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:54,260
end of today i have to find a replacement at the end of
today uh before before the announcement stream um so that's

2964
02:31:54,260 --> 02:32:01,440
like one thing that's stressing me out a little bit so i i
have to figure this out soon um other than that um the

2965
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:08,160
tournament itself it's gonna be um we proposed this option
to them because i thought it'd be better for like visibility

2966
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:14,480
and stuff because the obviously the pubg blind spot twitch
account might be like super new and stuff so there's not

2967
02:32:14,480 --> 02:32:27,060
like a lot of people following that so what we propose was
that, let me double check, is that I give them during the

2968
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:34,980
tournament itself, I give them my Twitch account to, because
I don't know if they have it, I don't know if the PUBG, I

2969
02:32:34,980 --> 02:32:39,420
don't think it's the PUBG Battlegrounds Twitch that would
have been broadcasting it, they'll have to use the PUBG

2970
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:47,040
Blindspot account, and basically, my Twitch account, they'll
have access to my twitch account during the tournament so

2971
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:53,780
the main broadcast with the casters and everything and the
povs different povs will be on twitch will be on my twitch

2972
02:32:53,780 --> 02:33:03,380
during february 15th and 16th and then um on my youtube
stream will be my pov with my team so that's how it's gonna

2973
02:33:03,380 --> 02:33:15,360
be so the people on twitch can also do like a coach can also
do a co-stream um with the twitch broadcast too was i

2974
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:23,600
thought it was a cool thing to do because you know they can
use uh you can they use my twitch stream to have like to

2975
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:28,760
give more visibility for like the main broadcast lali thank
you for the super chat thank you thank you just want to say

2976
02:33:28,760 --> 02:33:32,540
i'm happy exist you bring lots of enjoyment to people's

Give me a sec, guys.

2996
02:35:47,390 --> 02:35:48,930
So I've never had a prime.

2997
02:35:50,050 --> 02:35:51,430
I've never had a feastable.

2998
02:35:52,590 --> 02:35:54,870
And I've never had mold on pizza before.

2999
02:35:55,410 --> 02:35:56,430
So let's try this out.

3000
02:35:56,710 --> 02:35:56,730
Let's.

3001
02:35:57,350 --> 02:35:57,950
Let's try.

3002
02:36:04,290 --> 02:36:05,830
Let's try this out.

3003
02:36:06,310 --> 02:36:16,950
So for those who don't know, But those who don't know, the,
uh, the, the, let's see controversy, um, because they say,

3004
02:36:17,150 --> 02:36:20,470
quote unquote, that they don't have any preservatives on...

3005
02:36:20,470 --> 02:36:21,510
Wait, where's my feastable?

3006
02:36:21,630 --> 02:36:23,610
Oh, oh my God, it's such a ton of chocolate.

3007
02:36:23,630 --> 02:36:25,570
Sorry, above average chocolate bar.

3008
02:36:28,290 --> 02:36:28,910
All right.

3009
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:33,010
I got cherry freeze as my prime.

3010
02:36:33,590 --> 02:36:35,630
This is the first time... I'm getting cred right now.

3011
02:36:35,950 --> 02:36:37,550
It's my first time I've ever had prime.

3012
02:36:37,570 --> 02:36:38,030
before.

3013
02:36:38,190 --> 02:36:39,310
I've never had time.

3014
02:36:39,490 --> 02:36:44,630
I was like, oh my god, is that a lunch lead at my fucking
grocery store?

3015
02:36:45,130 --> 02:36:48,710
And it's the first time I've ever, because it's not like
fucking American, you know, so this is the first time I've

3016
02:36:48,710 --> 02:36:49,630
ever seen it in the wild.

3017
02:36:49,750 --> 02:36:53,790
I was like, oh my god, I get to be, you know what it's like
to be the 51st state.

3018
02:36:59,330 --> 02:37:00,270
It's just Gatorade.

3019
02:37:00,590 --> 02:37:03,350
This is, I'll eat a minute.

3020
02:37:07,470 --> 02:37:09,290
Holy shit, this is literally Gatorade.

3021
02:37:09,890 --> 02:37:13,510
This is, this is like, it's literally Gatorade.

3022
02:37:13,650 --> 02:37:15,270
I've had this exact flavor.

3023
02:37:20,530 --> 02:37:22,030
What do you expect?

3024
02:37:22,170 --> 02:37:23,850
Okay, it is pretty sweet.

3025
02:37:23,990 --> 02:37:25,690
Let me see what the...

3026
02:37:25,690 --> 02:37:27,230
It's 5 calories?

3027
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:29,610
There is no way.

3028
02:37:30,430 --> 02:37:30,970
There...

3029
02:37:30,970 --> 02:37:31,390
What?

3030
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:32,450
Okay.

3031
02:37:34,230 --> 02:37:41,050
It's 5 calories and the total sugar is 0 grams.

3032
02:37:41,130 --> 02:37:44,250
There's no fucking way I don't believe that.

3033
02:37:44,470 --> 02:37:45,770
This is really sweet.

3034
02:37:47,530 --> 02:37:48,770
Is it just all chemicals?

3035
02:37:49,090 --> 02:37:50,250
Maybe it's just chemicals.

3036
02:37:50,770 --> 02:37:53,410
Like, carbohydrate is 1%.

3037
02:37:54,150 --> 02:37:55,190
Five calories.

3038
02:37:57,390 --> 02:37:58,430
That's insane.

3039
02:38:00,970 --> 02:38:02,070
There's no way.

3040
02:38:03,250 --> 02:38:04,650
I feel like maybe it's just like...

3041
02:38:04,650 --> 02:38:06,510
Yeah, I feel like artificial sweeteners.

3042
02:38:06,650 --> 02:38:07,810
I think it's just all chemicals.

3043
02:38:09,030 --> 02:38:12,850
Spends all her money on Fortnite and that's to eat rations
to survive.

3044
02:38:12,990 --> 02:38:14,830
2026 color or high scale.

3045
02:38:14,990 --> 02:38:16,130
Thank you for the super chat.

3046
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:16,990
Thank you, thank you.

3047
02:38:17,030 --> 02:38:18,130
It has to be a lot.

3048
02:38:18,230 --> 02:38:18,470
All right.

3049
02:38:18,850 --> 02:38:19,230
All right.

3050
02:38:19,550 --> 02:38:27,170
Before I try to mold the pizza, I'm going to try my very
first Mr. Beast feastables.

3051
02:38:28,030 --> 02:38:30,730
My very first Mr. Beast feastables.

3052
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:38,370
I hear people say it's chocolate is like, like doesn't have
a lot of chocolate taste, which is crazy to think about

3053
02:38:38,370 --> 02:38:40,230
because like it's fucking chocolate.

3054
02:38:51,560 --> 02:38:51,920
What the?

3055
02:38:51,940 --> 02:39:13,550
fuck how can a chocolate okay no they are right they're
really they're this like the chocolate is like you can tell

3056
02:39:13,550 --> 02:39:27,950
it like there's very little flavor for chocolate yeah it's
like it's like You know, like, it's really like this type of

3057
02:39:27,950 --> 02:39:34,690
chocolate where it's like, I guess it's like vegan chocolate
type deal where it doesn't have very, it doesn't taste that

3058
02:39:34,690 --> 02:39:37,970
milky or taste that chocolate type deal.

3059
02:39:38,830 --> 02:39:41,550
Yeah, it's very, it's like diet chocolate, yeah.

3060
02:39:42,330 --> 02:39:44,170
I feel like there's not a lot of cocoa on it.

3061
02:39:44,750 --> 02:39:46,730
What the fuck is this tomato packet?

3062
02:39:47,410 --> 02:39:48,470
It just looks like ketchup.

3063
02:39:49,670 --> 02:39:52,650
All right, I haven't had like a lunchable in a long ass time
in general.

3064
02:39:52,650 --> 02:39:58,690
Also, my favorite, I never, I never really liked the pizza
lunchables in general.

3065
02:39:59,090 --> 02:40:00,810
I think my favorite was the cracker ones.

3066
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:02,890
It's all right.

3067
02:40:03,810 --> 02:40:05,510
It doesn't look moldy.

3068
02:40:08,530 --> 02:40:12,390
It, okay, that is, okay, I will say, like, what the fuck is
this?

3069
02:40:12,810 --> 02:40:17,030
The amount of cheese you get is like this tiny little
packet.

3070
02:40:17,930 --> 02:40:20,010
That's a tiny ass packet of cheese.

3071
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:23,710
wouldn't hurt, right?

3072
02:40:24,190 --> 02:40:25,130
How do I open this?

3073
02:40:27,230 --> 02:40:29,330
Oh, it's over here.

3074
02:40:30,770 --> 02:40:33,410
Captain, thank you for this super chat.

3075
02:40:33,730 --> 02:40:34,230
Thank you.

3076
02:40:34,270 --> 02:40:34,910
It's all right.

3077
02:40:35,930 --> 02:40:39,090
If I don't stream tomorrow, you know what happened to me.

3078
02:40:42,730 --> 02:40:47,550
If I, if tomorrow I went missing, you know what happened.

3079
02:40:48,290 --> 02:41:01,930
This is like the, I basically documents in my downfall But I
use the cheat like I put like a bunch of sauce on one slice

3080
02:41:01,930 --> 02:41:07,570
and then I and then I put the rest on top of And I put it on
top of the others.

3081
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:08,930
All right one pepperoni

3082
02:41:14,300 --> 02:41:16,760
Oh, yeah, that white was tomorrow too.

3083
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:19,200
That's fucking that's karma for me

3084
02:41:22,660 --> 02:41:34,450
Okay I will say the tomato paste is not that bad.

3085
02:41:39,130 --> 02:41:45,780
The one thing that doesn't feel super cheap is the tomato
paste.

3086
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:47,120
The tomato paste is not...

3087
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:53,460
I would actually get the tomato paste up with right there.

3088
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:57,380
I mean, I literally just gave billionaires more money.

3089
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:58,900
I gave Logan Paul KS.

3090
02:41:58,980 --> 02:41:59,940
Okay, KS5?

3091
02:42:00,380 --> 02:42:00,720
Alright.

3092
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:02,160
You know what's crazy?

3093
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:16,320
it's like what ksi mr beast and logan palm but if you like
look at oh my god there's so much i get only three slices i

evils and you guys are like there's no way you compared you

3099
02:43:16,860 --> 02:43:22,120

02:43:25,540 --> 02:43:36,760
he fucking he made his own hunger games like i don't like if
anything ksi if anything got rage made it on Twitter, but

3101
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:39,240
Mr. Beast literally made his own hunger games.

3102
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:41,940
Like, yeah.

3103
02:43:44,480 --> 02:43:53,420
Like, he's just, he has a cringy-ass song, and he made his,
he, he got rage-baited to hell on Twitter, but at least he

3104
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:55,160
didn't make his own hunger games.

3105
02:43:55,380 --> 02:43:55,840
Like,

3106
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:00,700
oh, that's true.

3107
02:44:03,820 --> 02:44:07,180
Bro, almost said Bro actually sent someone on fire.

3108
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:07,660
What do you mean?

3109
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:08,200
Almost.

3110
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:10,800
He actually did it.

3111
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:14,220
Bro, in the fucking...

3112
02:44:14,220 --> 02:44:14,860
You know what's great?

I didn't watch it, but I saw like...

3115
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:21,260
I saw like tweets talking about it.

3116
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:25,640
But like Mr. Beast literally buried a bunch of contestants.

3117
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:27,380
Like in a cemetery.

3118
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:29,920
To replicate his buried a live challenge.

02:46:42,030 --> 02:46:47,570
I'll be like, I'll be auditioning to be like the guy who
would let me tape a monitor on his chest.

3141
02:46:47,670 --> 02:46:48,870
And then I'll be like to Mr. Beast.

3142
02:46:49,290 --> 02:46:51,290
Oh yeah, this guy's my cousin.

3143
02:46:54,410 --> 02:46:55,210
He's family.

3144
02:46:55,990 --> 02:46:57,450
Can I have him represent me?

3145
02:46:58,150 --> 02:46:59,230
It's technically me.

3146
02:47:01,870 --> 02:47:13,830
yeah we'd have yeah and then okay anyway that reminded me of
that video I volunteer as a chance as like my champion to be

3147
02:47:13,830 --> 02:47:21,350
donkeys versus champion in the Mr. Beast death games but
like did anyone see the fucking crazy ass video like the

3148
02:47:21,350 --> 02:47:30,690
video of like the Mr. like on Twitter where during his new
beat his Beast game season 2 it was like to one of the the

3149
02:47:30,690 --> 02:47:36,670
contestants, I will give you a million dollars if you send
your team to the deaf ground.

3150
02:47:37,050 --> 02:47:38,270
And there was zero hesitation.

3151
02:47:38,410 --> 02:47:39,290
He pressed the button.

3152
02:47:39,510 --> 02:47:42,310
And like his team was like, how could you do this to us?

3153
02:47:42,610 --> 02:47:44,590
God will look down on you today.

3154
02:47:44,930 --> 02:47:48,030
And I'm just like, buddy, he doesn't even know who you guys
are.

3155
02:47:48,110 --> 02:47:49,310
You guys just met today.

3156
02:47:49,410 --> 02:47:51,590
A fucking course will fucking press the button.

3157
02:47:51,990 --> 02:47:57,730
That is so like a million dollars is a million dollars.

3158
02:47:58,090 --> 02:48:00,030
Why the fuck would he not press the button?

3159
02:48:00,110 --> 02:48:11,790
He's he doesn't know your life story he just met you today
yeah yeah it's a yeah why wouldn't you press the button fuck

3160
02:48:11,790 --> 02:48:18,230
yeah send them down there again no hesitation he just
pressed it instantly and then he's like i'm a million

3161
02:48:18,230 --> 02:48:25,070
dollars richer i don't care he's like and mr b's like how do
you feel knowing that you just set your team to to the to

3162
02:48:25,070 --> 02:48:28,230
the death round he's like well i'm just a million dollars
richer now

3163
02:48:37,450 --> 02:48:43,790
exactly they would have done the same fucking thing if they
were on his shoe i would have done it too i would have done

3164
02:48:43,790 --> 02:48:49,950
it i'll be like if i was like on this guy's team and he
pressed the button i'm like oh you know what that's fair i

3165
02:48:49,950 --> 02:48:54,650
don't just be like you know um that's fair yeah

3166
02:49:03,950 --> 02:49:04,750
narrow hesitation.

3167
02:49:12,470 --> 02:49:12,870
Hmm.

3168
02:49:14,870 --> 02:49:15,070
Hmm.

3169
02:49:30,430 --> 02:49:30,650
Exactly.

3170
02:49:30,850 --> 02:49:32,810
It's irresponsible to not press the buttons.

3171
02:49:32,990 --> 02:49:35,670
And Mr. Beast had to, like, try and be like, wow, I can't
believe you would do it.

3172
02:49:35,710 --> 02:49:37,730
I'm like, what the fuck anyone would do in this position?

3173
02:49:39,070 --> 02:49:41,370
What do you mean you can't believe he did it?

3174
02:49:42,290 --> 02:49:42,590
Alright.

3175
02:49:45,010 --> 02:49:59,630
My rating for the lunchly I will say the tomato paste was
actually pretty decent I had it okay I didn't tell you guys

3176
02:49:59,630 --> 02:50:09,930
this as well but I also bought a lunchable as a control
group earlier that is the only reason why is because like

3177
02:50:09,930 --> 02:50:16,810
the lunchable had a transformer on it too but I was just
like oh shit let's grab that one too I was like we had

3178
02:50:16,810 --> 02:50:23,090
lunchly I might as well First off, I saw the Lunchable first
Because I was like, oh, that's a Transformer, man I've had

3179
02:50:23,090 --> 02:50:31,630
Lunchable in a long time And then I saw the Lunchable I was
like, you know what, let's test this out No, the lead, it's

3180
02:50:31,630 --> 02:50:38,470
okay, I'm It's either lead poisoning or mold They'll fight
each other The lead poisoning will fight the mold And we'll

3181
02:50:38,470 --> 02:50:48,630
see who wins Anyway Anyway, so I also got the pizza one
Because that was the one that was on the Transformer Evil

3182
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:51,130
Doki would be like, I don't want the money.

3183
02:50:51,870 --> 02:50:53,250
Thank you for the super chat.

3184
02:50:53,450 --> 02:50:53,570
Thank you.

3185
02:50:53,890 --> 02:50:54,250
Thank you.

3186
02:50:56,230 --> 02:50:57,610
Yeah, they'll cancel each other out.

3187
02:51:00,130 --> 02:51:07,310
Anyway, so I think Lunche's tomato paste is better than the
Lunchable tomato paste.

3188
02:51:08,450 --> 02:51:11,950
The cheese, Lunchable gave me more cheese.

3189
02:51:14,070 --> 02:51:17,270
And also more slices, the pizza slices.

3190
02:51:18,310 --> 02:51:27,250
um i like the capri sun more than prime because i think
capri sun is also healthier than prime there is i there's no

3191
02:51:27,250 --> 02:51:34,450
way there's no sugar in prime that feels like a lot i like
drank prime and then i don't think it i there's i don't

3192
02:51:34,450 --> 02:51:42,470
really believe it's like mostly electrolytes um and i think
there is some some sugar in there i

3193
02:51:48,210 --> 02:51:54,190
Capri Sun wait how is it supposed to be pronounced that's
how my parents used to pronounce it so that's how I

3194
02:51:54,190 --> 02:52:04,090
pronounce it it's like how when I was growing up when I was
growing up and I had to sing the ABCs uh since my parents

3195
02:52:04,090 --> 02:52:13,130
were Asian immigrants in the Canada um English was their
second language so when they were teaching me the alphabet

3196
02:52:13,130 --> 02:52:35,470
it would be like a b c d e f c
G-H-I-J-K-L-O-M-N-O-N-O-N-O-N-N-O-N-N-O-N-N-N-N-O-N-N-N-O

3197
02:52:35,470 --> 02:52:51,070
because that's how my parents pronounced it so so so and
then you know the teacher was like all right students uh

3198
02:52:51,070 --> 02:53:01,710
let's sing the alphabet and then they're like and then i
would be like hello and then and then she did like she would

3199
02:53:01,710 --> 02:53:12,690
do like little quizzes on the alphabet too and was like guys
what letter um what what is the first letter for the word

3200
02:53:12,690 --> 02:53:17,390
lion and i would raise my hand And I'd be like, hello!

3201
02:53:19,790 --> 02:53:25,930
And then the teacher would be like, um, can you repeat that
little dokey?

3202
02:53:26,470 --> 02:53:28,590
And I'd be like, hello!

3203
02:53:31,830 --> 02:53:36,750
And then all the little kids laughed at me.

3204
02:53:37,290 --> 02:53:42,830
And then the teacher was like, oh, it's pronounced L.

3205
02:53:47,310 --> 02:54:03,990
and and now and that's why i have trust issues that's why
and then i remembered going home to my parents that day and

3206
02:54:03,990 --> 02:54:18,950
crying and brawling my eyes out and was like why did you lie
to me why did you teach me that Why did you teach me the

3207
02:54:18,950 --> 02:54:20,290
wrong letter?

3208
02:54:22,490 --> 02:54:25,890
It was never ELO.

3209
02:54:26,450 --> 02:54:28,490
It's ELO.

3210
02:54:30,770 --> 02:54:32,910
I trusted you.

3211
02:54:33,390 --> 02:54:36,030
I thought you knew the alphabet.

3212
02:54:41,650 --> 02:54:45,370
So, so yeah, it's like that.

3213
02:54:45,530 --> 02:54:48,670
So my parents will always be like, do you want a Capri Sun?

3214
02:54:49,570 --> 02:54:53,990
And now I find out it was never pronounced Capri Sun.

3215
02:54:54,390 --> 02:54:56,830
I don't even know what it's actually pronounced.

3216
02:54:57,490 --> 02:55:01,150
Guys, I don't even know what the real pronunciation is.

3217
02:55:01,890 --> 02:55:08,370
I've been living a lie for 20 plus years thinking it's
pronounced Capri Sun.

3218
02:55:20,770 --> 02:55:26,290
Anyway, source Ben, thank you for this super chat, thank
you, thank you.

3219
02:55:28,770 --> 02:55:29,890
All right.

3220
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:39,240
I purposely taught her a ride as a joke.

3221
02:55:40,100 --> 02:55:41,500
My neighbor's super chat, thank you.

3222
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:42,280
Thank you.

3223
02:55:48,280 --> 02:55:48,680
Anyway,

3224
02:55:52,580 --> 02:55:53,320
that's my life.

3225
02:55:54,120 --> 02:55:54,840
I'm still drinking for...

3226
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:56,100
I don't want to waste this pride.

3227
02:55:56,920 --> 02:55:58,160
It just tastes like Gatorade.

3228
02:55:58,500 --> 02:55:59,780
It tastes like Cherry Gatorade.

3229
02:55:59,980 --> 02:56:01,440
It tastes like Red Gatorade.

3230
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:02,660
That's the word better word.

3231
02:56:03,180 --> 02:56:06,900
I used to drink a lot of Gatorade in middle school and high
school because I did a lot of sports.

3232
02:56:07,260 --> 02:56:09,220
So my mom would always get me electrolytes.

3233
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:11,540
Or just buy me lots of...

3234
02:56:11,540 --> 02:56:14,900
I always drink a lot of electrolytes during my practices.

3235
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:17,440
And this literally tastes like Red Gatorade.

3236
02:56:18,640 --> 02:56:20,340
Purim, thank you, thank you.

3237
02:56:20,340 --> 02:56:23,880
I was made fun of by a teacher in high school and from
everyone for pronouncing Capri-San.

3238
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:26,560
Capri-San, just like you, thank you.

3239
02:56:26,920 --> 02:56:28,100
At least we can both suffer.

3240
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:30,620
We can trauma bond together, Purim.

3241
02:56:31,060 --> 02:56:32,920
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3242
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:35,640
Oh.

02:56:36,720 --> 02:56:38,800
Alright, let's check my super chats real quick.

3244
02:56:39,180 --> 02:56:41,120
Oh, and then super chat reading is so long.

3245
02:56:42,900 --> 02:56:45,840
Uh, do I even have that as a text?

3246
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:47,280

real life because it has happened way too many times where i

3253

say a word and then and I realized it was never right I'd be
like that's not how I say it in my head like fucking

Thank you.

3300
03:01:28,850 --> 03:01:29,030
Thank you.

3301
03:01:29,630 --> 03:01:31,250
I had a pipe burst in my house today.

3302
03:01:31,270 --> 03:01:32,790
So thanks for the three-hour distraction.

3303
03:01:32,850 --> 03:01:34,710
Just in time for the To tuvkey Day marriage.

3304
03:01:34,810 --> 03:01:35,710
Thank you for the super chat.

3305
03:01:35,830 --> 03:01:36,770
Thank you, thank you.

3306
03:01:37,390 --> 03:01:38,270
Oh my God.

3307
03:01:38,350 --> 03:01:39,570
I hope your house is okay.

3308
03:01:39,750 --> 03:01:49,570
I've never had a pipe burst, but, um, um, I, I, I assume the
bill is like really, really high because that shit is must

3309
03:01:49,570 --> 03:01:55,170
be like not only does like, you know, you got to fix the
pipe But like everything else like the floors and everything

3310
03:01:55,170 --> 03:02:01,930
and like Like the floors and tiles and everything is wet as
well And then you have to like drain stuff too.

3311
03:02:02,170 --> 03:02:09,630
Yeah, that sounds like that this is why you live in an
apartment and not a house I would assume like a house is

3312
03:02:09,630 --> 03:02:16,850
just harder to upkeep versus an apartment because like an
apartment the building does like most of the run of like

3313
03:02:16,850 --> 03:02:27,010
does most of the what's the word the um the uh i guess the
checks the building checks and everything pipes can burst in

3314
03:02:27,010 --> 03:02:33,470
apartment too yeah but then the building has to pay for it
not me because it's on them and not me because how the did i

3315
03:02:33,470 --> 03:02:42,030
that up yeah maintenance yeah management the building does
the maintenance and the management of the of like the all

3316
03:02:42,030 --> 03:02:51,050
like all the the like all the rooms I guess so like because
of that yuppie about everything so because of that I don't

3317
03:02:51,050 --> 03:02:58,110
really have to worry about the maintenance stuff but I know
the house is nice and everything but then like I'm scared of

3318
03:02:58,110 --> 03:03:09,290
the long term of owning a house because like because I'm
like oh man That's a lot of things.

3319
03:03:09,530 --> 03:03:11,050
Lots of things to clean.

3320
03:03:18,190 --> 03:03:24,870
The upkeep and the lots of things to be aware of for the
upkeep and also the cleaning of a house.

3321
03:03:26,710 --> 03:03:28,290
And then you have to renovate it too.

3322
03:03:30,110 --> 03:03:31,270
It could be a small house.

3323
03:03:31,350 --> 03:03:33,170
I don't want to live in suburbia.

3324
03:03:33,650 --> 03:03:40,110
If I have to live anywhere, if I have a house and I have to
live somewhere, I want to live in the gated community.

3325
03:03:43,030 --> 03:03:51,270
gated communities are closer to the city and like I never
lived in a suburb I technically never lived in a suburbia

3326
03:03:51,270 --> 03:04:03,450
before because like in in Canada I've I've never lived in a
suburbia before because when I was growing up uh richbert no

3327
03:04:03,450 --> 03:04:13,730
my grandpa my grandpa was uh was rich and he and he lived I
told you guys I lived in the gay community when I was in

3328
03:04:13,730 --> 03:04:22,470
China with my grandpa and he lived next to next to an
amusement park I told you guys he left live next to an

3329
03:04:22,470 --> 03:04:31,110
amusement park so I always hear I always heard fireworks at
10 p.m and I hear the national anthem at 8 a.m.

3330
03:04:31,110 --> 03:04:38,830
so I'll be woken up by the national anthem and then I could
I cannot sleep after 10 p.m because the fireworks will be

3331
03:04:38,830 --> 03:04:50,030
going yeah yeah because the amusement part will play the
national anthem at 8 a.m every day and then also we'll have

3332
03:04:50,030 --> 03:05:02,090
fireworks every day at 10 p.m but but my grandpa it didn't
matter to him because he would be awake at like guys okay

3333
03:05:02,090 --> 03:05:12,150
remember this was before the joke was a thing but at 6 a.m
he would be awake at around 6 or 7 a.m because he goes

3334
03:05:12,150 --> 03:05:22,590
golfing um every day he would go golfing at the golf club i
told this story before um but um he was a golfer and at six

3335
03:05:22,590 --> 03:05:30,570
to seven a.m he would go golfing uh or he'll wake up early
have breakfast and then go golfing so it was like normal

3336
03:05:30,570 --> 03:05:35,210
hours for him um before he goes to work

3337
03:05:40,330 --> 03:05:49,250
yeah so that was like the one time i lived in a gated
community Um, and, but then when I was in Canada, when I was

3338
03:05:49,250 --> 03:05:55,810
in Canada, um, oh my god, okay, it's actually, okay, I'll
tell you, this is actually, I'll give you guys a little Lord

3339
03:05:55,810 --> 03:06:05,850
dump, um, uh, about, like, my extended, my family, I told
you guys, my grandpa also, like, married, uh, a new, a new

3340
03:06:05,850 --> 03:06:15,110
wife, um, after, like, my grandma died, like, so he got, I
got a step grandma, and she was, like, literally only, uh, a

3341
03:06:15,110 --> 03:06:24,710
couple of like two to three years older than my oldest uncle
um yeah so anyway so anyway before that when i was in canada

3342
03:06:24,710 --> 03:06:33,870
well i told this before i told this story before about my
step grandma but she really liked me because um when she

3343
03:06:33,870 --> 03:06:39,150
asked like me what i want to buy i was just like i want
books you know like i would ask for like inexpensive stuff

3344
03:06:39,150 --> 03:06:46,270
and then the other cousins would want like my other cousins
will ask for like brand name products like you know they

3345
03:06:46,270 --> 03:06:53,050
would want like like like designer brands like clothes or
bags or shoes and then when she asked me what i want i'd

3346
03:06:53,050 --> 03:07:07,230
just be like i want books i want some english books because
it's so hard to get english books here like because i didn't

3347
03:07:07,230 --> 03:07:15,910
care like for those who don't know in china um designer
brands um are much more popular over there than it is in

3348
03:07:15,910 --> 03:07:21,970
canada uh when i used to grow up so like in canada no one
really wears designer brands or any like you just want like

3349
03:07:21,970 --> 03:07:29,750
something comfy it'll always be like uh roots or gap or like
old navy like stuff like that like people don't really wear

3350
03:07:29,750 --> 03:07:38,810
designer brands in canada but in china is like a lot about
like like um like the image and stuff so like a lot of

3351
03:07:38,810 --> 03:07:45,930
people would get cars a lot of people get designer brands
and everything um so it was like a whole um what's the word

3352
03:07:45,930 --> 03:07:54,050
it's like a public look that you have to upkeep and stuff
yeah like it's like a public face that you have to have um

3353
03:07:54,050 --> 03:08:01,270
and so my grandma my step grandma liked me the most out of
all my cousins and then so my other cousins really fucking

3354
03:08:01,270 --> 03:08:06,330
hated me because i was like my grandpa and step grandma's
favorite because i didn't really care

3355
03:08:09,570 --> 03:08:17,050
I didn't really care about like designer brands or like
expensive items I cared about video games But then like you

3356
03:08:17,050 --> 03:08:23,970
couldn't at that time you couldn't really The only place you
can go to to get like Games and stuff like video games

3357
03:08:23,970 --> 03:08:29,970
either for your DS or like for your PlayStation or Xbox You
have to go to Hong Kong to get it because you couldn't get

3358
03:08:29,970 --> 03:08:33,670
it in China back then And or you go to the underground
market

3359
03:08:37,350 --> 03:08:41,450
My dad would take me to the underground market with the
boxes.

3360
03:08:41,810 --> 03:08:46,070
And then you, like, flip through the little plastic bags to
find.

3361
03:08:46,230 --> 03:08:47,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3362
03:08:51,990 --> 03:08:54,310
Yeah, the underground market.

3363
03:08:55,890 --> 03:09:04,310
Anyway, as I was saying, in Canada, in Canada, I also didn't
live in suburbia when I was growing up in Canada for the

3364
03:09:04,310 --> 03:09:05,530
first 10 years of my life.

3365
03:09:07,350 --> 03:09:14,430
it was technically not suburbia because if you go down the
street you will you you basically it's where like all the

3366
03:09:14,430 --> 03:09:21,730
stores and the restaurants were so like like technically it
was suburbia but not because just you go down like three

3367
03:09:21,730 --> 03:09:28,810
blocks and you're at the the street where all like the
restaurants and stores were so um like like near us so it

3368
03:09:28,810 --> 03:09:35,010
was like it was sort of like close very close to like a
place to go instead of like but then like i really hate

3369
03:09:35,010 --> 03:09:42,490
suburbia because um When I was in university, I was touring,
like, places to rent, you know, because I didn't want to

3370
03:09:42,490 --> 03:09:47,310
live with a roommate, I think, in my second year of
university.

3371
03:09:49,290 --> 03:09:58,190
So I didn't want to live with a roommate on campus because
I, like, first year trying to live with a roommate was

3372
03:09:58,190 --> 03:09:58,770
fucking hell.

3373
03:09:59,710 --> 03:10:03,430
My roommate was, like, the party girl, and I was the study
girl.

3374
03:10:03,430 --> 03:10:12,130
and literally she was like inviting people all the time into
our dorm and I fucking hated it and then because like and

3375
03:10:12,130 --> 03:10:20,990
then every time someone would be knocking on my door to like
to like ask for her and I had to make a little sign where it

3376
03:10:20,990 --> 03:10:27,490
says if she was in the room or not because I kept getting
people when I'm studying because I was taking like seven

3377
03:10:27,490 --> 03:10:38,230
classes for a semester because I wanted to graduate early so
I took like like at least seven classes um for like the

3378
03:10:38,230 --> 03:10:44,970
first year of my semester per semester yeah basically each
semester I had seven classes um seven or eight I don't

3379
03:10:44,970 --> 03:10:53,250
remember I just had like a like the maximum amount um yeah I
hated myself I really did um so that's why I was like

3380
03:10:53,250 --> 03:10:59,650
spending a lot of time just studying and stuff and because I
wanted to graduate early um because i already did the

3381
03:10:59,650 --> 03:11:09,950
international baccalaureate i already did the international
baccalaureate and i think yeah and um so i was on the path i

3382
03:11:09,950 --> 03:11:18,530
already had like almost a year's worth of credits from the
international baccalaureate program so i was like oh if i do

3383
03:11:18,530 --> 03:11:26,610
all these classes i can graduate like like half a year or a
year earlier um if i just churn it out on the first year and

3384
03:11:26,610 --> 03:11:33,410
and then i did not want to do the ib program by the way my
parents you know what's up i'm sorry i'm jumping between

3385
03:11:33,410 --> 03:11:44,650
tangents but in high school the ib pro when i was about to
hit uh 11th grade when i was about to go to like my was it

3386
03:11:44,650 --> 03:11:56,210
was it junior year 11th grade um my school what like my
school got rid of the ib program Because they're like, it's

3387
03:11:56,210 --> 03:11:56,950
too hard.

3388
03:11:58,570 --> 03:12:01,070
So my school got rid of it.

3389
03:12:01,490 --> 03:12:05,050
And then my parents were like, how dare you get rid of it?

3390
03:12:05,230 --> 03:12:09,110
We're transferring her to another school where it has the IB
program.

3391
03:12:09,930 --> 03:12:16,810
And so they took me out of my school that have all my
friends in.

3392
03:12:17,510 --> 03:12:21,930
Took me to a different city that had the IB program in.

3393
03:12:22,290 --> 03:12:23,830
And then I had to start.

3394
03:12:23,970 --> 03:12:39,490
junior year with people i've never like like zero friends
and like zero friends new city um all the other classmates

3395
03:12:39,490 --> 03:12:51,470
have been together since like kindergarten and and also uh
three weeks but at like three weeks late into the school

3396
03:12:51,470 --> 03:13:01,110
year by the way so like i to the school three weeks late so
so I was already like I was three weeks behind in the first

3397
03:13:01,110 --> 03:13:14,730
semester of junior year it was so traumatic and I usually I
would like use sports as a way to distress but they had they

3398
03:13:14,730 --> 03:13:25,130
had no female soccer team they had no female volleyball team
they had no female basketball team the only female team they

3399
03:13:25,130 --> 03:13:35,490
had was handball and then i remembered this like after my
first year during my after like end of the year for the

3400
03:13:35,490 --> 03:13:41,190
theme during the end of the year my junior year because i
didn't join handball because i was like that's not a fucking

3401
03:13:41,190 --> 03:13:47,670
real sport i'm sorry if anyone actually plays handball
that's not a fucking real sport but all the guys had actual

3402
03:13:47,670 --> 03:13:55,410
teams and then the only team I could join in that school was
literally track and field and the field department because I

3403
03:13:55,410 --> 03:14:02,270
was like the best at shot put because I did shot put javelin
discus for my old school so that was like I automatically

3404
03:14:02,270 --> 03:14:08,250
got it because I there was no competition in that new school
there was no fucking competition in the new school for the

3405
03:14:08,250 --> 03:14:14,730
field department so I got into the field team for discus
shot put and javelin for them but that was literally like

3406
03:14:14,730 --> 03:14:24,730
the only sport I did for that school because all the only
teams they had um the only teams they had in that school was

3407
03:14:24,730 --> 03:14:36,530
was for the guys and not for like the females so I was just
like what the do I do like and then I had to play I played

3408
03:14:36,530 --> 03:14:43,650
volleyball with the teachers at that school because the
teachers had every lunchtime, they would have like a

3409
03:14:43,650 --> 03:14:50,750
volleyball, like I guess like a pick-me-up game at lunchtime
with all the teachers there and the assistants.

3410
03:14:51,050 --> 03:14:54,270
So I just joined in because they're like, wow, the student
actually knows how to play volleyball.

3411
03:14:54,410 --> 03:14:56,830
And I just played with them because I had nothing else to
fucking do.

3412
03:14:57,210 --> 03:14:59,430
And I was like craving any type of sport.

3413
03:14:59,570 --> 03:15:01,870
Like I was just like, this is so fucked up.

3414
03:15:02,350 --> 03:15:05,850
Like I was craving any type of sport that I can do.

3415
03:15:06,310 --> 03:15:12,370
Like, and I was like, Anyway, anyway, anyway, so funny
story.

3416
03:15:12,650 --> 03:15:19,330
At the end of my junior year, we had to play handball
because it was like end of the year.

3417
03:15:19,570 --> 03:15:21,910
And they're like, okay, guys, what do you want to play?

3418
03:15:22,350 --> 03:15:27,550
And then like my class, like my PE class was like, let's
play handball.

3419
03:15:28,270 --> 03:15:33,430
And I was literally fucking destroying everyone because I
had good hand eye coordination.

3420
03:15:34,090 --> 03:15:42,670
And then the PE teacher, who was apparently the coach of the
handball team, literally pulled me aside and I was like,

3421
03:15:43,270 --> 03:15:45,790
wait, why didn't you try out for the handball team?

3422
03:15:45,930 --> 03:15:47,550
We might, we were looking for someone like you.

3423
03:15:47,750 --> 03:15:51,070
And then I straight up told her, I don't see handball as a
sport.

3424
03:15:51,430 --> 03:15:51,430
Like,

3425
03:15:54,660 --> 03:16:01,040
I'm sorry, I don't see handball as a sport.

3426
03:16:14,850 --> 03:16:19,010
Like, yeah, to her face.

3427
03:16:19,410 --> 03:16:23,990
To her face, I just, I was like, I'm not trying out for your
fucking handball team, ma'am.

3428
03:16:24,130 --> 03:16:24,630
I'm sorry.

3429
03:16:25,030 --> 03:16:28,670
Like, I don't recognize that as a real sport game.

3430
03:16:29,030 --> 03:16:32,770
Because I felt like I was playing, it's literally for those
who never played handball before.

3431
03:16:34,090 --> 03:16:38,490
This was also, by the way, the very first time I played
handball.

3432
03:16:38,850 --> 03:16:43,510
And it was literally, it's literally like, it's literally,
you catch the ball.

3433
03:16:43,510 --> 03:16:47,690
When you catch the ball, you can't move with the ball.

3434
03:16:48,170 --> 03:16:49,910
So you can intercept the ball.

3435
03:16:50,210 --> 03:16:52,190
It's just not a real fucking sport.

3436
03:16:52,310 --> 03:16:53,130
I'm so sorry.

3437
03:16:53,970 --> 03:16:56,990
It's like the only time you can move is when you catch it.

3438
03:16:57,050 --> 03:16:58,630
And when you catch it, you just stop.

3439
03:16:59,910 --> 03:17:03,410
And then you're supposed to shoot it into a goal.

3440
03:17:03,810 --> 03:17:06,090
It's an Olympic sport.

3441
03:17:07,230 --> 03:17:08,270
I'm sorry.

3442
03:17:08,730 --> 03:17:10,190
Like it was like a pity.

3443
03:17:10,290 --> 03:17:11,130
I swear to God.

3444
03:17:11,190 --> 03:17:12,810
Handball got in and be a pity.

3445
03:17:12,910 --> 03:17:13,490
I'm sorry.

3446
03:17:13,510 --> 03:17:23,550
like it's just passing the ball that's how I feel like
you're you're just passing the ball like it's not like I'm

3447
03:17:23,550 --> 03:17:28,210
sorry and then like there's a goalkeeper in the goal that's
just I

3448
03:17:37,490 --> 03:17:49,190
um anyway any I I'm it looks very it it I personally think
i'm sorry it just looks very stupid i'm sorry compared to

3449
03:17:49,190 --> 03:17:57,310
the other sports i've played i i just i just don't recognize
it it's like how people are like i don't recognize sealand

3450
03:17:57,310 --> 03:18:02,010
as a country i don't recognize handball as a real sport um

3451
03:18:08,270 --> 03:18:15,690
um well i think it was richard thinking thank you and now
you're a vtuber i know know anyway and then and i don't

3452
03:18:15,690 --> 03:18:23,930
remember how the teacher reacted i just went back to playing
handball i just went back to the class like after she pulled

3453
03:18:23,930 --> 03:18:30,410
me aside i just and i told her i don't remember what i said
after i just remember saying i'm sorry i don't see handball

3454
03:18:30,410 --> 03:18:36,730
as a sport and then i it's a real sport and then i just i
kept playing

3455
03:18:47,020 --> 03:18:54,920
and then okay anyway i want to tell you about this other
story um then you guys were like well if your grandpa was um

3456
03:18:54,920 --> 03:19:02,280
was so wealthy like what happened like after he passed away
you must have been willed a lot of money no because um

3457
03:19:02,280 --> 03:19:21,340
because like um my i have one uncle one aunt two aunts and
one side and um they were all very money hungry people as

3458
03:19:21,340 --> 03:19:28,000
well i don't care i'm there i'm i'm you know what's crazy
after my grandpa passed away we've never seen my extended

3459
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:38,100
family again like because like the only reason we were all
together was because of my grandpa so that was the only

3460
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:47,300
reason why we would all meet up together so like it was for
like my grandpa like and it's classic soap opera

3461
03:19:50,740 --> 03:20:03,400
it was literally like the classic soap opera where like you
know like those TV dramas those TV dramas where like all the

3462
03:20:03,400 --> 03:20:09,540
family members are like trying to vie for my grandpa's
attention and like because he's like the head chairman like

3463
03:20:09,540 --> 03:20:20,440
the head the head of the family and everything and yeah so
um so my My aunt, my two aunt, like, I would say, okay, one

3464
03:20:20,440 --> 03:20:22,020
of my aunts was actually adopted.

3465
03:20:22,840 --> 03:20:30,900
It was actually a really, um, a really, it was like a
semi-sad story, but my grandma, my actual grandma, not my

3466
03:20:30,900 --> 03:20:38,860
step grandma, my grandma's brother, um, wife couldn't have
children, like, was told that she couldn't have children.

3467
03:20:39,380 --> 03:20:42,760
So my grandma adopted a child for them.

3468
03:20:43,400 --> 03:20:45,820
And then later on, like, she got the...

3469
03:20:45,840 --> 03:20:53,160
her brother's wife got pregnant so they're like we don't
need her as anymore so like and then my my grandma took her

3470
03:20:53,160 --> 03:21:03,520
back in and raised her as her own um so like so my one my
aunts was adopted um and but like it was only my grandma

3471
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:11,220
that like recognized her as like part of the family and but
then she did grow up with like the rest of my like you know

3472
03:21:11,220 --> 03:21:23,680
my aunts and uncles and is a crazy story but she was like
she always helped out the family a lot and she would be like

3473
03:21:23,680 --> 03:21:30,180
the one to take care of like my other aunts and my other
uncles kids as well um and she has her own she has her own

3474
03:21:30,180 --> 03:21:39,320
family as well too uh because my grandpa helped hook up my
aunt uh my aunt with like um with like a husband and

3475
03:21:39,320 --> 03:21:50,440
everything like she like apparently the the aunt's husband
um the husband was like the top of his class like he was a

3476
03:21:50,440 --> 03:21:58,240
government official um and he scored the highest in his
class and everything to get into the government and stuff um

3477
03:21:58,240 --> 03:22:08,280
so my grandpa helped my adopted aunt uh arranged like
arranged the uh the date for like you know like a what's it

3478
03:22:08,280 --> 03:22:15,640
called a blind like not blind date like arranged a date
between the two for them and stuff yeah number one rank of

3479
03:22:15,640 --> 03:22:27,480
his class and everything anyway so yeah so you know so then
like obviously like the husband helped out with my helped up

3480
03:22:27,480 --> 03:22:33,580
like with my grandpa as well because you know he obviously
is like i told you it's like a tv drama and shit so like

3481
03:22:33,580 --> 03:22:42,400
that my grandpa could also like you know use my adopted
aunt's husband to help with like um with the with any like

3482
03:22:42,400 --> 03:22:52,640
with any jobs that he needs to get done because he was a
very smart man anyway yeah it's like he helped with the

3483
03:22:52,640 --> 03:23:05,820
matchmaking yeah anyway my aunt my other aunt and my my aunt
that's crazy okay my other aunt i'll tell you her story she

3484
03:23:05,820 --> 03:23:17,220
got divorced got divorced but yet the husband was always in
the picture somehow like it was so weird it was so fucking

3485
03:23:17,220 --> 03:23:25,900
weird he would always show up and then start got married to
another guy and then got divorced with him and then came

3486
03:23:25,900 --> 03:23:30,760
went back to the first husband is like it was so weird it
was so weird

3487
03:23:35,020 --> 03:23:37,240
yeah like yeah like

3488
03:23:40,460 --> 03:23:49,800
And then my other uncle was a fucking playboy, just like
those TV dramas, because he was the firstborn son.

3489
03:23:50,240 --> 03:23:55,920
It's always, you know, like the head of the family, the
firstborn son is always a playboy type deal in those TV

3490
03:23:55,920 --> 03:23:56,360
dramas.

3491
03:23:56,660 --> 03:23:58,740
That was literally my extended family.

3492
03:23:59,080 --> 03:24:07,700
The firstborn son of the head of the family was a fucking
playboy for the majority of his life until he finally

3493
03:24:07,700 --> 03:24:09,200
settled down.

3494
03:24:09,400 --> 03:24:27,440
with like a beauty pageant winner with like like a beauty
pageant winner um yeah and uh she was really pretty i will

3495
03:24:27,440 --> 03:24:35,020
say like his wife was super pretty um i remember when i
first saw and i was like whoa oh yeah he was also divorced

3496
03:24:35,020 --> 03:24:41,360
too i forgot about that because like when they got married i
was I didn't really visit the fab I didn't really I think I

3497
03:24:41,360 --> 03:24:50,580
don't know if I was born yet but he also like cheated on his
like on his first wife a lot so then um and then but then

3498
03:24:50,580 --> 03:24:56,860
like she got like super ostracized because like back then it
was like you don't talk about it like you just got to suck

3499
03:24:56,860 --> 03:25:03,480
it up back then like because it's like all about your image
and everything so nobody really gets divorces and stuff back

3500
03:25:03,480 --> 03:25:10,920
in the day especially if you're like you know for the
reputation of the family like i told you it was a tv drama

3501
03:25:10,920 --> 03:25:15,400
because i was like why because when my mom was telling me
the story of the first wife because i was like there was a

3502
03:25:15,400 --> 03:25:21,460
first wife and she's like yeah we don't really talk about it
much but um back in the day like he cheated on her a lot and

3503
03:25:21,460 --> 03:25:28,420
she would always come to me when she's crying about like new
girl he was with and you're like but like she had to suck

3504
03:25:28,420 --> 03:25:33,300
like at first she had to suck it up and just like let it
happen because for the image of the family you're not

3505
03:25:33,300 --> 03:25:39,780
supposed to get a divorce or anything because it looks
really so like she sucked it up until it was too late and

3506
03:25:39,780 --> 03:25:45,300
then like she was like because like and then she stayed
because she was like if i have a kid with him it'll be it'll

3507
03:25:45,300 --> 03:25:51,620
be okay and in the end they never had kids together so then
she was like i can't do this anymore i'm gonna get a divorce

3508
03:25:51,620 --> 03:25:57,600
and then she got super ostracized from the family and then i
like to the point where i didn't even know she existed like

3509
03:25:57,600 --> 03:26:07,780
i didn't even know he had a first wife that i didn't even
know like she even like existed like when I was finally like

3510
03:26:07,780 --> 03:26:26,840
there like yeah yeah and it yeah and then yeah and then like
so yeah and then my oldest uncle he finally settled down um

3511
03:26:26,840 --> 03:26:35,440
and it was fine it was like now he lives in like Portugal
like because he was like he was like I want my kid to um to

3512
03:26:35,440 --> 03:26:45,460
be like to have like be bilingual and then I was like
Portugal yeah they now live apparently I was it was one of

3513
03:26:45,460 --> 03:26:53,120
the European countries because he was trying to like he was
trying to like immigrate to a foreign country and he was

3514
03:26:53,120 --> 03:27:01,520
trying really hard he look he I remembered the story because
he kept asking my family for help because kidding I was born

3515
03:27:01,520 --> 03:27:10,280
in Canada um I was born in Canada and um but my parents were
immigrants and he was trying to get my dad and my mom to

3516
03:27:10,280 --> 03:27:18,900
help him immigrate immigrants immigrate somewhere and he got
his applications got rejected like from to a lot of

3517
03:27:18,900 --> 03:27:26,020
countries and I think like the only finally he got accepted
and it was Portugal like he was trying like trying so

3518
03:27:26,020 --> 03:27:34,280
because he wanted his son to have like to be like more like
i guess more international and and stuff so he wanted his

3519
03:27:34,280 --> 03:27:40,580
son to be more international and have more life experiences
he was like 10 at that i think he was like 8 or 7 when he

3520
03:27:40,580 --> 03:27:51,060
was finally when he finally went to portugal um but um
portugal was the one that fought because i think he wanted

3521
03:27:51,060 --> 03:28:01,440
to immigrate immigrant immigrate to australia um but then
his application and I think he tried Australia, Canada, and

3522
03:28:01,440 --> 03:28:07,400
in several European countries and then finally in Portugal
was the one that accepted him and then he moved to Portugal.

3523
03:28:08,540 --> 03:28:10,100
Bandit, thank you for the Akasupa.

3524
03:28:10,460 --> 03:28:11,460
Thank you, thank you.

3525
03:28:11,940 --> 03:28:15,300
It's my birthday and I gotta support my Kamioshi who got me
into VTubers.

3526
03:28:15,440 --> 03:28:16,860
Thank you for everything you did, Joki.

3527
03:28:16,940 --> 03:28:18,340
Thank you for this Akasupa.

3528
03:28:18,700 --> 03:28:19,640
Thank you, thank you.

3529
03:28:19,880 --> 03:28:21,960
I hope you have a great birthday.

3530
03:28:22,380 --> 03:28:24,300
Happy birthday to you.

3531
03:28:26,780 --> 03:28:29,260
Happy birthday, dear bandit.

3532
03:28:29,620 --> 03:28:31,360
Happy birthday to you.

3533
03:28:31,440 --> 03:28:32,720
Yeah, happy birthday.

3534
03:28:34,400 --> 03:28:35,480
I don't know.

3535
03:28:36,660 --> 03:28:39,440
I don't remember how many countries he's applied to.

3536
03:28:39,860 --> 03:28:46,780
I remember, like, when he got rejected to Australia, he was
crying and calling my dad about it because he was like, you

3537
03:28:46,780 --> 03:28:48,520
know, he wanted help with it.

3538
03:28:48,640 --> 03:28:59,300
And then my dad was like, I can't get too involved into this
because the thing is, the reason why, was because like, um,

3539
03:28:59,840 --> 03:29:10,220
it's harder because a lot of my extended family has
government jobs in, um, has government jobs.

3540
03:29:10,520 --> 03:29:16,820
So it's harder to immigrate to other countries because of
it, uh, because of my family, my extended family background

3541
03:29:16,820 --> 03:29:19,180
history, uh, working in the government.

3542
03:29:21,340 --> 03:29:22,580
So it's a lot harder.

3543
03:29:23,440 --> 03:29:23,900
Yeah.

3544
03:29:26,360 --> 03:29:29,720
Oh, yeah.

3545
03:29:33,240 --> 03:29:36,460
Look, my dad never, never worked in the government.

3546
03:29:36,600 --> 03:29:39,640
That's why he's able to immigrate to Canada with my mom.

3547
03:29:39,720 --> 03:29:42,440
Because my mom immigrated to Canada when she was a teenager.

3548
03:29:47,160 --> 03:29:49,580
Anyway, more background lore history.

3549
03:29:51,320 --> 03:29:53,560
Yeah, I'm a double H.

3550
03:29:53,900 --> 03:29:57,300
I'm a sleeper agent here to collect your data.

3551
03:29:59,920 --> 03:30:02,920
I'm actually a sleeper agent right now.

3552
03:30:10,100 --> 03:30:10,820
Anyway.

3553
03:30:12,680 --> 03:30:15,880
Don't joke, it is getting the sleeper face.

3554
03:30:16,440 --> 03:30:19,540
La, la, la, la, la, la, yabadabadoo.

3555
03:30:21,960 --> 03:30:22,540
Anyway.

3556
03:30:23,220 --> 03:30:23,480
Okay.

3557
03:30:23,900 --> 03:30:30,820
The original story I went to, I want to talk about was that,
um, oh yeah, and also I really, I never liked my extended

3558
03:30:30,820 --> 03:30:35,420
family because, like I said, they were all, like, super
money hungry and power hungry.

3559
03:30:36,400 --> 03:30:42,520
Um, and I was just, I, I, and they hated me because my
grandpa and my step-grandma really liked me.

3560
03:30:43,020 --> 03:30:46,940
Um, they said I was, like, the best grandchild out of all
the grandchildren.

3561
03:30:47,900 --> 03:30:53,680
So, obviously, I was also the smartest grandchildren, like,
grandchild out of all of them.

3562
03:30:53,900 --> 03:30:57,400
So, and the only one that knew English as well.

3563
03:30:58,080 --> 03:31:03,000
So my cousins and my extended family hated me because of it,
because I knew English.

3564
03:31:03,480 --> 03:31:10,220
I could speak English, and I had a lot of, like, awards and
stuff, and I was doing well academically as well.

3565
03:31:11,440 --> 03:31:21,440
And, um, and so, like, and I was technically the firstborn
that, that, although I wasn't a son, I was the firstborn,

3566
03:31:21,660 --> 03:31:23,880
but I was the firstborn that had my...

3567
03:31:23,900 --> 03:31:32,600
my grandpa's last name so I was higher tiered than the
firstborn grandchild because the firstborn grandchild came

3568
03:31:32,600 --> 03:31:43,020
from my aunt's side so his last name was the husband's name
and not my grandpa's name um and then obviously my uncle my

3569
03:31:43,020 --> 03:31:51,860
uncle ended up having the firstborn son but my grandpa and
grandma always compared him to me because they would be like

3570
03:31:51,860 --> 03:31:58,820
when Doki was your She was, she already won this, this award
and that award.

3571
03:31:59,300 --> 03:32:02,680
And she, um, and she was always reading her books.

3572
03:32:03,200 --> 03:32:10,900
Uh, your, but your son, she's out there playing on his iPad,
playing, playing video games, um, at the dinner table.

3573
03:32:11,360 --> 03:32:15,480
But when Doki was his age, she was reading her books at the
dinner table.

3574
03:32:15,800 --> 03:32:17,340
Why can't you be more like Doki?

3575
03:32:17,680 --> 03:32:23,100
And then here I am sitting at the dinner table, reading my
book as I hear this argument going on for the seventh time.

3576
03:32:23,960 --> 03:32:31,930
no oh no yeah i'm just like oh no

3577
03:32:40,350 --> 03:32:48,530
yeah yeah and then like my grandpa and grandma would always
like do these comparisons to my so all the cut my cousins

3578
03:32:48,530 --> 03:32:56,030
ostracized me because they were like they're like fuck her
like she thinks she's so special just because she knows

3579
03:32:56,030 --> 03:33:02,930
english and ignores us whenever we try to talk to her but
thing is i didn't know mandarin at that time because i grew

3580
03:33:02,930 --> 03:33:12,630
up with cantonese um i hate youtube and i was on george they
get the super chat they get they so then my cousins hated me

3581
03:33:12,630 --> 03:33:23,010
um because and also like my like you know um because they're
like the golden grandchild and then getting like she's

3582
03:33:23,010 --> 03:33:29,570
always ignoring us doesn't even want to hang out with us but
at that time i could only speak english and cantonese

3583
03:33:29,570 --> 03:33:34,910
because i've never learned mandarin because my parents were
like she doesn't need to know mandarin we just talked to her

3584
03:33:34,910 --> 03:33:43,190
in cantonese like but the rest of my the all the other all
my cousins spoke mandarin and it was only my uncles and

3585
03:33:43,190 --> 03:33:49,430
aunts that spoke cantonese because they didn't teach their
kids cantonese so they didn't teach their kids cantonese and

3586
03:33:49,430 --> 03:33:54,990
my parents didn't teach me Mandarin so I couldn't I didn't I
had to it took me like a year or two to finally understand

3587
03:33:54,990 --> 03:34:00,790
Mandarin by then it was too late and then the cousins hated
me because they're like oh she's she doesn't give a fuck she

3588
03:34:00,790 --> 03:34:07,590
thinks she's so good she thinks she's better than us yeah
she doesn't she pretends she pretends she ignores us all the

3589
03:34:07,590 --> 03:34:13,290
time pretends to don't understand us and I was like I don't
know I'm pretending I actually don't even know what you're

3590
03:34:13,290 --> 03:34:19,630
saying because like they would try to talk to me they would
try to talk to me and I would look at my mom and I or I

3591
03:34:19,630 --> 03:34:22,070
would and be like, what are they saying?

3592
03:34:24,450 --> 03:34:32,250
I see like, they'd be like, and I'd look at my mom or dad to
be like, translation, please, because I don't know what

3593
03:34:32,250 --> 03:34:33,150
they're saying.

3594
03:34:33,370 --> 03:34:36,730
I don't, they're like, and I'm like,

3595
03:34:39,790 --> 03:34:40,750
oh, oh, oh.

3596
03:34:47,730 --> 03:34:49,510
I was so confused.

3597
03:34:52,210 --> 03:35:01,050
yes my parents were mic translator while I was growing up it
took me a while because I um it took me a while because like

3598
03:35:01,050 --> 03:35:07,570
like I said like Mandarin Cantonese at that time I've never
heard Mandarin before because like in Canada everybody spoke

3599
03:35:07,570 --> 03:35:17,510
Cantonese and I was in a Cantonese um um my school was a uh
English slash Cantonese school it was like a a Catholic

3600
03:35:17,510 --> 03:35:24,630
private school um but and they had like after school
Cantonese program there so we would all just speak Cantonese

3601
03:35:24,630 --> 03:35:29,830
so I've never heard Mandarin before I didn't realize there
was a second dialect because my parents never spoke Mandarin

3602
03:35:29,830 --> 03:35:37,830
to me before either um in Canada so so when I came to China
was the very first time I heard Mandarin and then at that

3603
03:35:37,830 --> 03:35:44,530
time I was like to me it was like a different language and
it took me a while to like like like immerse myself into

3604
03:35:44,530 --> 03:35:54,550
like you know in the language um to to figure out because
then by that I watched a lot of like Chinese TV and also

3605
03:35:54,550 --> 03:36:00,150
like honestly listening to conversations and stuff to the
point where I finally understood like the difference between

3606
03:36:00,150 --> 03:36:08,110
the two and then like I finally figured it like you know it
took me like a year I think like a year to finally like be

3607
03:36:08,110 --> 03:36:15,350
able to like listen to Mandarin and to be able to like what
they tell me but I couldn't really speak Mandarin too yet

3608
03:36:15,350 --> 03:36:22,830
but it took me like two more years to be able to speak a bit
uh but i had a really bad accent when i tried to speak

3609
03:36:22,830 --> 03:36:34,870
manner in it was it was like it's like super ex-accented um
anyway anyway um the end goal of the story where i was

3610
03:36:34,870 --> 03:36:41,390
saying like after my grandpa passed away like i have no more
connection with my extended family it was because he passed

3611
03:36:41,390 --> 03:36:50,170
away when i was in canada and my parents were also in canada
and then when he passed away and that we were they were

3612
03:36:50,170 --> 03:36:59,510
planning for all the families were planned like like like
Senate family was planning um the funeral the uncle called

3613
03:36:59,510 --> 03:37:07,230
us and was like we need to talk about the will like to like
be like you gotta give us um they're like trying to

3614
03:37:07,230 --> 03:37:19,790
negotiate the will because like apparently um he didn't will
he didn't I don't know what it was but um my grandpa didn't

3615
03:37:19,790 --> 03:37:27,970
finish the will so because of that there was like a
negotiation regarding like who gets what

3616
03:37:31,890 --> 03:37:44,950
who gets what and then my dad he is the youngest child he is
yeah he is like the youngest child of the entire family so

3617
03:37:44,950 --> 03:37:56,250
because of that um My dad didn't want to get involved in the
family drama after my grandpa passed away and was just like,

3618
03:37:57,030 --> 03:37:57,970
just don't involve me.

3619
03:37:58,110 --> 03:37:58,930
Like, I don't care.

3620
03:38:01,790 --> 03:38:04,310
So we didn't get anything in the end.

3621
03:38:05,310 --> 03:38:11,650
We didn't get anything in the end because like he didn't
want to get involved with the whole negotiation of like who

3622
03:38:11,650 --> 03:38:13,710
gets what and like of everything.

3623
03:38:17,470 --> 03:38:24,910
split it even though you know that in the perfect world
maybe but this is my tv drama right now this

3624
03:38:28,550 --> 03:38:44,150
this was my family tv drama and i never works that easily
yeah yeah yeah and and so i like my family didn't get

3625
03:38:44,150 --> 03:38:53,510
anything in the end when my grandpa passed away um so i
didn't inherit i didn't inherit anything at all um uh oh

3626
03:38:53,510 --> 03:39:04,110
yeah also like it was crazy because like all my cousins were
trying to fast pass life getting like getting a kid getting

3627
03:39:04,110 --> 03:39:10,150
a wife getting a kid so that my grandpa could fund
everything that was how much i like i hated my extended

3628
03:39:10,150 --> 03:39:19,850
family because like my oldest cousin the technically
firstborn married uh got girlfriend early married super

3629
03:39:19,850 --> 03:39:33,690
young um had a kid super young um and like uh begged my
grandpa for a job at his company like so he could like and

3630
03:39:33,690 --> 03:39:38,810
then would just follow him around everywhere um so he could
like get as much money as he could.

3631
03:39:39,510 --> 03:39:42,910
Yeah, so like he literally begged my grandpa for like two
cars.

3632
03:39:43,370 --> 03:39:46,450
My oldest cousin, he got two cars.

3633
03:39:46,990 --> 03:39:51,570
And then and like a loan for his kid.

3634
03:39:51,730 --> 03:39:54,870
And then my grandpa paid for his wedding and everything.

3635
03:39:55,270 --> 03:39:55,470
Yeah.

3636
03:39:55,830 --> 03:40:03,090
So he like fast passed as much as he could so that he could
like mooch off of my grandpa as much as he can for his

3637
03:40:03,090 --> 03:40:03,510
future.

3638
03:40:04,710 --> 03:40:05,050
Yeah.

3639
03:40:05,450 --> 03:40:13,870
And then he tried to take my my oldest cousin tried to take
my family's car because when we moved to Hong Kong we had a

3640
03:40:13,870 --> 03:40:21,790
car in China and then you called up my dad and was like oh
you're not using that car anyway like can I use can I borrow

3641
03:40:21,790 --> 03:40:28,190
it uh since it's just sitting in the garage and then my dad
was like what the fuck no like why do you want my car you

3642
03:40:28,190 --> 03:40:39,130
already have two cars like yeah and he would always because
like I live with my grandpa when I was growing up um uh when

3643
03:40:39,130 --> 03:40:45,570
I was living in China I lived with my grandpa growing up so
my grandpa would always host like family dinners and stuff

3644
03:40:45,570 --> 03:40:52,230
like every Friday there would be a big there would be a
family dinner with all my extended family my uncles my aunts

3645
03:40:52,230 --> 03:41:00,150
um and cousins and everything like every Friday or Saturday
but on the other days I would always eat with him like my

3646
03:41:00,150 --> 03:41:06,510
family and I would always eat with him because we would one
of the reasons why we came back to China was because my dad

3647
03:41:06,510 --> 03:41:15,070
wanted to take care of was the caretaker of technical he
wasn't like caretaker he just wants to um take care of my

3648
03:41:15,070 --> 03:41:21,210
grandpa like you know take care of his dad um because the
other family members didn't do it so my dad was like the

3649
03:41:21,210 --> 03:41:29,710
caretaker uh for like my my like his dad so we would live um
we would like uh live with my

3650
03:41:33,650 --> 03:41:48,050
And so, but then, like, when my oldest cousin, when my
oldest cousin got a job at my grandpa's company, he would

3651
03:41:48,050 --> 03:41:52,970
always follow us around everywhere for free meals, for free
dinners.

3652
03:41:53,710 --> 03:42:00,270
And it was so awkward, because he was obviously there for,
like, free food and everything.

3653
03:42:00,270 --> 03:42:08,090
like he didn't like he would be like don't worry i'll be the
i'll because like my grandpa also has his own chauffeur and

3654
03:42:08,090 --> 03:42:16,810
everything he would have his own chauffeur and stuff and
then my oldest cousin like told told him to let go of his

3655
03:42:16,810 --> 03:42:24,150
his usual like his usual chauffeur that he's always had for
years and he's like don't worry i can drive you around and

3656
03:42:24,150 --> 03:42:29,510
so he could like follow like so he could like mush off of
the dinners and stuff and that's also why i didn't really

3657
03:42:29,510 --> 03:42:36,230
like my cousin like my oldest cousin um oh yeah and i didn't
like my other cousin because he made me do his english

3658
03:42:36,230 --> 03:42:44,850
homework when i went to hang out with him fuck that guy like
when i first came to when i first came came over uh when i

3659
03:42:44,850 --> 03:42:54,470
first um came over to china uh moved over to china and my
mom wanted me to make friends with my cousins um one of my

3660
03:42:54,470 --> 03:43:00,170
cousins invited me over and i thought we're gonna have like
we're gonna play or something like because it was my first

3661
03:43:00,270 --> 03:43:06,630
was the same cousin that gave me food poisoning because his
stuff like he told me to eat like street sausages because

3662
03:43:06,630 --> 03:43:12,930
he's like it's fine they're really good and i was like okay
and i got food poisoning and he was okay because and my mom

3663
03:43:12,930 --> 03:43:19,470
scolded me and he was like he's like dokey you're so stupid
like he was born here his stomach is made for these types of

3664
03:43:19,470 --> 03:43:25,670
food you're not you grew up in canada you're not fit for
this food yet your stomach is weak and i was just like and

3665
03:43:25,670 --> 03:43:36,170
then i was you know fucking dying of food poisoning I was
dying like I don't have local resistance yeah I wasn't made

3666
03:43:36,170 --> 03:43:44,590
for it I was like I didn't know my cousin said it was really
good anyway other than that he would fucking make me do his

3667
03:43:44,590 --> 03:43:50,750
English homework because he'd be like well I can't play
right now so um you'd be like I can't play right now because

3668
03:43:50,750 --> 03:43:56,710
I have to do my English homework I guess if you want to help
me finish my homework then we can play together So he would

3669
03:43:56,710 --> 03:44:01,650
force me to, because then, like, if I don't, I just don't
know what to do, because I was just, I had to stay at his

3670
03:44:01,650 --> 03:44:07,990
place for, like, half of the day until it was dinner time,
and then we go meet up for the family dinner thing, and then

3671
03:44:07,990 --> 03:44:15,010
so, like, because then he would, like, it's not, it was
either I wait for him, I would wait, like, a couple of hours

3672
03:44:15,010 --> 03:44:20,930
for him to finish his English homework, or I finish it for
him, so we could do something, or else I have nothing to do,

3673
03:44:20,990 --> 03:44:27,050
because I was like, what the fuck do I do, I don't know, I
just moved here, I don't know what to do, And then so he

3674
03:44:27,050 --> 03:44:35,450
would make me do his stupid English homework And then he
would scold, yeah And then he apparently almost failed his

3675
03:44:35,450 --> 03:44:42,770
English homework Because I didn't fucking know they were
teaching British English So when I was like, I saw a soccer

3676
03:44:42,770 --> 03:44:50,170
ball I wrote soccer And then he was like, you, he was like,
you did this on purpose You gave me the wrong answer The

3677
03:44:50,170 --> 03:44:54,230
right answer was football And I was like, what the fuck is
football?

3678
03:44:56,350 --> 03:44:58,510
I was like, that's not football.

3679
03:44:59,050 --> 03:45:01,690
A football is a diamond ball.

3680
03:45:01,990 --> 03:45:02,870
That's a circle.

3681
03:45:03,330 --> 03:45:04,190
That's soccer.

3682
03:45:08,670 --> 03:45:11,670
He was like, the right answer was football.

3683
03:45:12,070 --> 03:45:15,350
And I was like, bro, I don't fucking know what football is.

3684
03:45:15,610 --> 03:45:18,770
The only football I know is American football.

3685
03:45:19,510 --> 03:45:32,530
Like, and then he was, mad because I almost made him failed
his English homework because I was fucking I was doing it by

3686
03:45:32,530 --> 03:45:43,230
like you know you know I was doing it by like the fucking
English I grew up in that's like the one one of the things I

3687
03:45:43,230 --> 03:45:49,070
remember because you got really mad at it he's got because
the next time came over you got really mad at me being like

3688
03:45:49,070 --> 03:45:57,530
you almost made me fail English not fail english but you
almost made me like fail my english homework and i was like

3689
03:45:57,530 --> 03:46:04,810
this is the right answer i was like it's the right answer i
don't fucking know why it was marked wrong

3690
03:46:09,320 --> 03:46:12,460

flair uh swordsman papa Nexi, Nepers, WB, Solid, Medi, Rice.

3692
03:47:28,980 --> 03:47:29,760
Thank you for the super chat.

3693
03:47:30,000 --> 03:47:30,120
Thank you.

3694
03:47:30,360 --> 03:47:30,700
Thank you.

3695
03:47:31,060 --> 03:47:31,400
Oh, yeah.

3696
03:47:31,460 --> 03:47:36,980
There's another reason why I was trying to fast pass into
graduating university early.

3697
03:47:37,840 --> 03:47:47,220
It was because my grandpa at that time he was like, whenever
you graduate, I'll buy you a house.

3698
03:47:47,860 --> 03:47:51,960
And I was like, and I never asked for anything.

3699
03:47:52,180 --> 03:47:56,900
I never asked for anything in my life, like, from my
grandpa.

3700
03:47:57,360 --> 03:47:58,960
So I was, like, free house.

3701
03:48:04,320 --> 03:48:08,000
But then, sadly, my grandpa passed away before I graduated.

3702
03:48:08,520 --> 03:48:11,380
So I, I, I didn't get the free house.

3703
03:48:12,280 --> 03:48:15,880
That's why I don't have a free house.

3704
03:48:16,460 --> 03:48:16,840
I didn't.

3705
03:48:21,500 --> 03:48:22,500
I didn't.

3706
03:48:23,060 --> 03:48:23,340
Yeah.

3707
03:48:25,300 --> 03:48:32,160
It was like, because he was like, you want to, okay, it was
crazy, like, when I got my driver's license, he asked me if

3708
03:48:32,160 --> 03:48:41,220
I wanted a free car, and I was like, no, it's okay, I don't
want to drive, I was just like, I don't want to drive, I was

3709
03:48:41,220 --> 03:48:49,580
so scared of driving, and I was like, it's okay, I don't
need a free car, I didn't, so he's like, okay, how about

3710
03:48:49,580 --> 03:49:03,340
this, because I, I got my driver's license, uh, when, When I
turn 18, when I turn 18, because I got my drivers license in

3711
03:49:03,340 --> 03:49:04,580
Canada.

3712
03:49:05,140 --> 03:49:11,000
After I graduated high school, I went back to Canada to get
my driver's license because I graduated high school in Asia.

3713
03:49:12,980 --> 03:49:16,120
And then I also really hated driving.

3714
03:49:16,300 --> 03:49:20,920
So I was like, it's such a waste of money to get me a car
because I really hated driving.

3715
03:49:20,920 --> 03:49:29,000
like after after I passed my driver's license um after I
like I did first try by the way my parents and my fucking

3716
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:36,360
driving teacher never believed in me in getting my driver's
license on the first try they were so surprised like I came

3717
03:49:36,360 --> 03:49:42,360
back and I was like I pat I got a hundred percent and then
they were like oh they actually were like cheering and

3718
03:49:42,360 --> 03:49:48,540
celebrating and then my driver's teacher was like are you
like even my driver's teacher did not believe in me getting

3719
03:49:48,540 --> 03:49:52,140
passing it on the first Like, my parents also.

3720
03:49:52,540 --> 03:49:53,860
And they're like, you're not joking, right?

3721
03:49:53,860 --> 03:49:55,140
I was like, no, I got it.

3722
03:49:55,200 --> 03:49:56,560
I passed my test.

3723
03:49:56,940 --> 03:49:59,620
And they were like, and they're like, we didn't think you
could do it.

3724
03:49:59,800 --> 03:50:03,280
And I literally got 100% on my driver's test, too, by the
way.

3725
03:50:03,760 --> 03:50:06,660
I had, I took lessons every fucking day.

3726
03:50:07,020 --> 03:50:14,040
And even then, my teacher or my parents did not believe in
me getting it on the first try.

3727
03:50:19,700 --> 03:50:20,900
And, and.

3728
03:50:20,920 --> 03:50:29,920
anyway and then after I got my driver's license I never
drove a car since um like I never drove a car since so like

3729
03:50:29,920 --> 03:50:36,220
when my grandpa was like congratulations on driving your
driver's license do you want to I can get you a car and I

3730
03:50:36,220 --> 03:50:42,600
was like no it's a waste of money like I don't want it I
don't want to drive it's such a waste and you're like how

3731
03:50:42,600 --> 03:50:50,640
about this um after you graduate university I'll get you a
um I'll get you a I'll buy you a house slash apartment

3732
03:50:50,640 --> 03:50:54,800
because at that point time I was like I like an apartment
please and not a house because I was like what am I fucking

3733
03:50:54,800 --> 03:51:01,040
am I gonna do like because like you know like I just got in
university and I was like what the fuck am I gonna do with a

3734
03:51:01,040 --> 03:51:10,640
house after I graduate I was like I'll be like I'm by myself
and then I also have to take care of like I'm like I need to

3735
03:51:10,640 --> 03:51:18,440
figure out what the fuck I want to do in my life and I was
like I I don't think I am like suitable in in owning a house

3736
03:51:18,440 --> 03:51:30,020
yet so I like an apartment is cool too you know yeah yeah I
was just like an apartment is cool too because I just got

3737
03:51:30,020 --> 03:51:37,320
into university so I was just like thinking about it I was
just like that has so much work like and I don't even know

3738
03:51:37,320 --> 03:51:47,260
if I want to live there for the rest of my life with a house
I don't know um yeah I was gonna say I'm so young how do I

3739
03:51:47,260 --> 03:51:54,020
cannot manage a house so young right now I feel like i need
to be older to be able to manage a house i don't even know

3740
03:51:54,020 --> 03:52:03,080
how to manage a dorm room um how much did your grandfather
pay that the sorry they give us a super chat thank you thank

3741
03:52:03,080 --> 03:52:12,700
you yeah and then but then unfortunately my grandpa passed
away before i could graduate university so like and then my

3742
03:52:12,700 --> 03:52:21,380
parent like i didn't inherit anything um from my grandpa
grandfather uh because my like he didn't finish his will um

3743
03:52:21,380 --> 03:52:30,580
he didn't finish his will um for this like like it's very it
was very sad when that happened but it was also like um i i

3744
03:52:30,580 --> 03:52:39,120
personally don't know what happened um but i think like he
he got he had like a test or something like he got a scan

3745
03:52:39,120 --> 03:52:45,720
and they found something and he did surgery but i don't
think it i i like i just heard bits and pieces of it from

3746
03:52:45,720 --> 03:52:52,300
when my parents were talking because like they didn't want
to tell me the whole story so i only heard like bits and

3747
03:52:52,300 --> 03:53:01,840
pieces of what happened um and then like i think like after
uh after the surge like apparently the surgery wasn't

3748
03:53:01,840 --> 03:53:11,800
successful um in removing whatever it was that he had and
then he passed away uh uh he passed away after that so i

3749
03:53:11,800 --> 03:53:21,140
unfortunately i don't know the full story of what happened
but that was like thing is the really fucked up part was I

3750
03:53:21,140 --> 03:53:31,560
never even got to go to the funeral um because like my dad
didn't want to be involved um with didn't want to be

3751
03:53:31,560 --> 03:53:40,020
involved with like the family dynamics after him passing
away and like the family politics that was going on that we

3752
03:53:40,020 --> 03:53:48,660
didn't leave Canada uh and went back we didn't go back to
China um when he passed away during like the whole funeral

3753
03:53:48,660 --> 03:53:54,500
and everything so I never even got to go to the funeral
which I was really sad about because he didn't want to get

3754
03:53:54,500 --> 03:54:00,720
involved with like the negotiation of like because like they
were saying if you're coming to the funeral we have to talk

3755
03:54:00,720 --> 03:54:08,400
about like what we're doing with like his assets and
everything yeah so I never got a chance to go to the funeral

3756
03:54:08,400 --> 03:54:16,520
because of it which is one of the things I regret the most
because, uh, he's been a big part of my life.

3757
03:54:17,120 --> 03:54:20,320
And despite the TV drama, I had to go through.

3758
03:54:21,800 --> 03:54:22,360
Yeah.

3759
03:54:23,280 --> 03:54:23,280
Yeah.

3760
03:54:23,800 --> 03:54:27,120
Despite the, um, no, I never got a chance.

3761
03:54:27,220 --> 03:54:32,760
I never went back to, I never went back to Shinjin after
that.

3762
03:54:33,160 --> 03:54:35,340
Uh, because, um, after that.

3763
03:54:35,400 --> 03:54:44,800
So I, I don't even know what happened because like my entire
family my my close my family cut off the extended family and

3764
03:54:44,800 --> 03:54:55,020
then i don't really like i said i don't talk to my parents
anymore um uh and my parents are separated now so like uh i

3765
03:54:55,020 --> 03:55:09,580
don't even i don't even know what's going on anymore like so
i don't going on anymore so i i don't know like where my

3766
03:55:09,580 --> 03:55:19,780
like the details of like where my grandfather like when was
buried or anything yeah yeah like i told you my family is

3767
03:55:19,780 --> 03:55:30,980
like it was it was very like those tv dramas that you see uh
that you see uh like actual soap opera shit

3768
03:55:35,350 --> 03:55:46,370
yeah yeah But I'm, I, that's why I think I'm saying, I, I'm
doing as okay as I can, learning how to be on my own, like,

3769
03:55:46,510 --> 03:55:54,990
I'm trying my best, it's like baby steps, you know, it's
like little baby steps every day.

3770
03:55:57,450 --> 03:56:07,470
The Doki lore is insane, yeah, but it was, like, my choice
to not, to, like, leave my family, also, like, not like, you

3771
03:56:07,470 --> 03:56:08,010
know, I'm expended.

3772
03:56:08,210 --> 03:56:15,950
extended family was my family's choice for extended family
it was like my family's choice to cut off the extended

3773
03:56:15,950 --> 03:56:22,990
family because they didn't want to get involved in uh they
didn't want to get involved in like the family politics

3774
03:56:22,990 --> 03:56:32,910
after my grandpa passed away and then for me it was also
because like my uh my parents were very controlling um even

3775
03:56:32,910 --> 03:56:38,610
when i was growing up and it was like not very good
mentally.

3776
03:56:39,650 --> 03:56:48,010
And then it took a really big decision for me to finally cut
them out because like it was really bad.

3777
03:56:48,450 --> 03:56:50,790
Like it got really, really bad.

3778
03:56:51,890 --> 03:56:59,370
And then before all of that happened, my dad separated with
my mom before.

3779
03:57:00,390 --> 03:57:02,510
And then like, and it was like me and my mom.

3780
03:57:02,990 --> 03:57:07,390
And then my mom got very, very controlling because it was
just us two left.

3781
03:57:08,210 --> 03:57:12,310
because my dad, when he separated my mom, he flew back to
China.

3782
03:57:13,050 --> 03:57:15,610
So, and then it was just me and my mom in Canada.

3783
03:57:16,190 --> 03:57:21,710
And then it got really bad because she tried to control my
business and my life because, you know, there was like

3784
03:57:21,710 --> 03:57:22,610
nothing else left.

3785
03:57:23,150 --> 03:57:30,250
And then at that point, I was like, I had to make a big
decision and be like, I can't do this anymore.

3786
03:57:30,390 --> 03:57:38,190
Like, I am going on my own, you know, like I'm like, I'm
going to, I'm going to be my own person.

3787
03:57:38,210 --> 03:57:47,190
person and then I like cut myself off from there and then
found myself and and then left my and then uh found myself

3788
03:57:47,190 --> 03:57:55,130
my own apartment my my staff actually helped me a lot as
well and I found myself my own like my staff helped me find

3789
03:57:55,130 --> 03:58:01,470
an apartment and I literally moved there in a week and I
really appreciate my landlord for like like he literally

3790
03:58:01,470 --> 03:58:07,690
fast passed my application and everything and like got me
like let me like get the apartment and like rent the

3791
03:58:07,690 --> 03:58:14,830
apartment within like a week process and everything um and
and then after that like you know i've just been learning

3792
03:58:14,830 --> 03:58:22,510
how to live on my own type deal because i've always had to i
was babied a lot growing up and i was i lived in a very

3793
03:58:22,510 --> 03:58:34,170
bubbled how it lived in a bubble child i was literally a
bubble child i was like i said that's why i was like when i

3794
03:58:34,170 --> 03:58:41,450
was growing up i wasn't allowed to touch the stove or
anything until I turned 18, which is fucking crazy.

3795
03:58:41,610 --> 03:58:44,090
Like when I told people that, they're like, are you okay?

3796
03:58:44,210 --> 03:58:46,210
And I was like, my parents never let me touch the stove.

3797
03:58:46,690 --> 03:58:51,570
Like, like I wasn't allowed to touch the lighters.

3798
03:58:51,770 --> 03:58:54,390
I wasn't allowed to touch the stove or anything.

3799
03:58:56,070 --> 03:59:06,210
And like, I didn't learn how to use the dishwasher or like
use the, like use the laundromats or like, not the laundry,

3800
03:59:06,430 --> 03:59:15,030
the dryer, the washer until I was like 18 and then that's
when my parents had to do like a fucking because they're

3801
03:59:15,030 --> 03:59:23,970
like they're like oh shit you gotta because I chose the
university I chose was not the university they wanted me to

3802
03:59:23,970 --> 03:59:34,670
go because the university they wanted me to go was a more
Asian university and I went to a predominantly white

3803
03:59:34,670 --> 03:59:45,530
university instead because in their heads gonna they were
gonna try and uh they were like oh okay if she goes to the

3804
03:59:45,530 --> 03:59:53,150
university here we have a lot of relatives and friends that
live there and then we can hire one of them to like look

3805
03:59:53,150 --> 03:59:58,290
after her so she doesn't have to learn like basic
necessities and then i was like nope i'm gonna choose this

3806
03:59:58,290 --> 04:00:09,050
university instead i'm just like i want to choose this
university instead and that like through in their plans

3807
04:00:09,050 --> 04:00:16,450
because they're like oh okay we got we got teacher we gotta
teach her everything

3808
04:00:19,650 --> 04:00:23,950
it's so because i was like um i don't know how to do
anything

3809
04:00:28,730 --> 04:00:36,650
and and then so they had to do give me like a like what is
it called like a speed run lesson on life on how to use the

3810
04:00:36,650 --> 04:00:42,910
washer, use the dryer, learn how to cook, learn how to use
the stove.

3811
04:00:46,110 --> 04:00:49,530
And I was just like, ooh, what?

3812
04:00:50,430 --> 04:00:53,750
They're like, you gotta do this and this and this.

3813
04:00:53,810 --> 04:00:55,750
Yeah, crash course on everything.

3814
04:00:57,970 --> 04:01:03,370
The whole speed run before I went to university, before I
went to a dorm.

3815
04:01:06,290 --> 04:01:11,490
um rice thank you for the super chat thank you thank you
moving away from my parents was one of the best things i did

3816
04:01:11,490 --> 04:01:14,330
for myself i'm glad you got out of the situation thank you
thank you thank you thank you for the super chat thank you

3817
04:01:14,330 --> 04:01:25,670
thank you yeah it was one of the hardest decisions in my
life but i don't regret it at all because um i get to be my

3818
04:01:25,670 --> 04:01:34,110
own person now instead of like it's hard being it is hard
though there is a lot of difficulties i am a lot more

3819
04:01:34,110 --> 04:01:44,130
stressed out but i have more freedom to actually do what i
want to do instead of having my life be controlled by

3820
04:01:44,130 --> 04:01:55,890
someone else which is something it got really bad like um i
can talk about this really because I've like I guess like it

3821
04:01:55,890 --> 04:02:07,310
was a long time ago so like I've what's the word I've like
processed it and I guess like um and like be able to like

3822
04:02:07,310 --> 04:02:16,930
move from it but like it was like bad to the point where
like um like basically I didn't even have control of my own

3823
04:02:16,930 --> 04:02:26,670
bank account type situation So like, like my parents
basically controlled my entire bank account and like I

3824
04:02:26,670 --> 04:02:29,190
didn't have access to my own bank account too.

3825
04:02:29,570 --> 04:02:44,830
Or like my own or like basic stuff like they would put my
name on like they would put my name on things that I can't

3826
04:02:44,830 --> 04:02:46,930
even use and stuff.

3827
04:02:48,850 --> 04:02:58,550
my dad got a car but then he put my name on it and I don't I
don't even know where the car is anymore because when I left

3828
04:02:58,550 --> 04:03:15,750
like I I didn't I couldn't get the car like the car was in
my name but like it was not my car yeah yeah yeah so so I I

3829
04:03:15,750 --> 04:03:18,390
don't know where that car is I don't know what I

3830
04:03:24,310 --> 04:03:32,190
yeah and yeah and i was just like we're i don't know i just
like i the my first thought was like i just want to move out

3831
04:03:32,190 --> 04:03:39,730
you know that was my first thought like i was like i want to
move out and i want to you know i want to have i have to

3832
04:03:39,730 --> 04:03:49,570
like you know i want to get out get all my stuff that i can
get out get get and keep and then and And then, you know, I

3833
04:03:49,570 --> 04:03:52,950
had, like, one day to fully move out, basically.

3834
04:03:53,150 --> 04:03:55,330
I had to, like, speed run to move out.

3835
04:03:57,690 --> 04:04:04,850
Well, the thing is, my dad, at that time, when I fully left,
it was just me and my mom.

3836
04:04:05,390 --> 04:04:10,730
And then my dad, my dad at that time was already separated
from my mom.

3837
04:04:11,010 --> 04:04:12,510
So it was just me and my mom left.

3838
04:04:15,210 --> 04:04:18,450
So, like, it was just, like, my mom had the use of the car.

3839
04:04:18,510 --> 04:04:26,530
type yeah and it's just like stuff like that and then like
they would like use like they would take money out of my

3840
04:04:26,530 --> 04:04:37,770
bank account i this was a long time ago people during like
the bark knights era remembered that but there was one time

3841
04:04:37,770 --> 04:04:46,070
where they took money out of my personal bank account to
like buy a car and like that shit fucked me up a lot when i

3842
04:04:46,070 --> 04:04:52,730
was growing up because i saved a my personal bank account
and then like they were like we're gonna use your money to

3843
04:04:52,730 --> 04:05:01,330
buy a car it's very good for your credit and then i was just
like but i'm not even gonna use that car like this was years

3844
04:05:01,330 --> 04:05:10,570
ago though this was like this was like a couple of years ago
yeah and then and then but they're like don't worry like uh

3845
04:05:10,570 --> 04:05:16,330
it'll be really good for your credit and then and we're
gonna need you to go over there to sign the car in your name

3846
04:05:16,330 --> 04:05:28,190
and i was just like i don't need a car i just i i i don't
drive but then it was like my parents car type deal yeah and

3847
04:05:28,190 --> 04:05:39,450
that's like basically like how bad it was so like that's why
like when i was finally like when i was finally like you

3848
04:05:39,450 --> 04:05:50,290
know my own person and everything I just the freedom it gave
me was just more more worth it than like the struggles of

3849
04:05:50,290 --> 04:06:05,250
trying to learn how to be a person like how to be an adult
yeah yeah I was just like I was just like um and then

3850
04:06:05,250 --> 04:06:15,970
obviously without your help chat I wouldn't be all of that
because i was never i never had the courage or like the

3851
04:06:15,970 --> 04:06:24,790
financial i guess like the financial security to even do it
because at that point you know i heavily depended on my

3852
04:06:24,790 --> 04:06:33,350
parents and stuff on like life and stuff because like at
that time i didn't really have like a job that paid enough

3853
04:06:33,350 --> 04:06:42,250
to be my own like to be independent so like i relied heavily
on i couldn't like like I had to like just you know follow

3854
04:06:42,250 --> 04:06:49,370
along and like listen to my parents and stuff with like
whatever they want me to do and everything and be like you

3855
04:06:49,370 --> 04:06:55,230
gotta do this you gotta do that and like even when I was
like you know even with the whole family politics back then

3856
04:06:55,230 --> 04:07:00,850
uh with my extended family I was also like it was like also
like super controlling where they're like you gotta do this

3857
04:07:00,850 --> 04:07:05,130
you gotta do that you have to do this you have to do that
like you gotta you know

3858
04:07:09,730 --> 04:07:15,530
I gotta have a tutor every fucking day.

3859
04:07:15,630 --> 04:07:17,750
You know, it was wild in high school.

3860
04:07:18,370 --> 04:07:23,430
I had a tutor almost every day for every subject to make
sure I do well in school.

3861
04:07:23,950 --> 04:07:27,150
And each tutor session was like two hours long every day.

3862
04:07:27,350 --> 04:07:29,850
And I was like, it was fucking terrible.

3863
04:07:31,070 --> 04:07:38,290
It was so, like I had like, in the eye, especially like in
the, it was like during my last two years of school, I had a

3864
04:07:38,290 --> 04:07:39,590
tutor every day.

3865
04:07:39,730 --> 04:07:45,410
for all the subjects I was taking to make sure I don't fail
my international baccalaureate.

3866
04:07:45,810 --> 04:07:48,870
It was two hours every fucking day for each subject.

3867
04:07:49,450 --> 04:07:51,190
Sometimes I would have double sessions.

3868
04:07:51,630 --> 04:07:53,550
So I would have a four-hour tutor session.

3869
04:07:53,950 --> 04:08:01,750
So it would be like a two hours on math and a two hours in
biology or something for one day.

3870
04:08:02,270 --> 04:08:05,410
And then the other day would just be like, it was like, it
was that.

3871
04:08:05,590 --> 04:08:09,710
And then like, obviously there was like family image at the
uphold back then.

3872
04:08:10,990 --> 04:08:19,930
and like, oh my gosh, I hated the, I hated the big family
dinners sometimes, but it wasn't like every day, like

3873
04:08:19,930 --> 04:08:28,050
sometimes they were fine, but then like, it was like every
Friday or Saturday, I had to come to the, I had to come to

3874
04:08:28,050 --> 04:08:34,750
the big family dinner and like be like a model
granddaughter, and like my mom wouldn't let me play video

3875
04:08:34,750 --> 04:08:35,570
games too.

3876
04:08:35,770 --> 04:08:42,890
Sometimes I wanted to play on my DS and And I, like, you
know, I would be playing Pokemon Mystery Dungeon or some

3877
04:08:42,890 --> 04:08:43,190
shit.

3878
04:08:43,610 --> 04:08:45,670
And then my mom would be like, yo, here's the book.

3879
04:08:45,910 --> 04:08:46,630
Read the book.

3880
04:08:46,710 --> 04:08:50,090
And I'd be like, I want to play Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

3881
04:08:50,610 --> 04:08:58,730
I, I'd be like, I don't want to play Pokemon Mystery
Dungeon.

3882
04:09:00,090 --> 04:09:03,970
Like, no, no, read your book at the dinner table.

3883
04:09:08,170 --> 04:09:18,110

doing right now and how good you're doing and i'll just be

3899
04:11:35,810 --> 04:11:48,590
like it's like you know like a puppet and i was just like oh
i fucking hated it i hate it that time

3900
04:11:52,910 --> 04:12:10,250
yeah it was like it was so much fucking pressure back then
it was so exhausting and like I do some of the things I do

3901
04:12:10,250 --> 04:12:19,850
miss a lot is yeah you know like that when we were playing
yapp yapp and then I was like the little monkey dancing for

3902
04:12:19,850 --> 04:12:27,550
men when she turned me into a tiny like when she turned me
into like a tiny guy and then I was just like woo dance

3903
04:12:27,550 --> 04:12:38,650
monkey dance yeah I think it's like no it was just like very
it's it's not your typical controlling or strict it was just

3904
04:12:38,650 --> 04:12:49,330
that my extended family had a really like had a image to
uphold so like the politics within it like I said it was

3905
04:12:49,330 --> 04:12:57,090
like literally it felt like a TV Like that you watch on like
the Chinese TV like not just Chinese the Asian TV dramas

3906
04:12:57,610 --> 04:13:05,090
That you actually watch on TV about like the head of the
family and like their their his like sons and daughters and

3907
04:13:05,090 --> 04:13:06,390
stuff And it's like the corporate.

3908
04:13:07,050 --> 04:13:07,510
Oh my god.

3909
04:13:07,670 --> 04:13:13,230
It's it literally felt like I'm reading this web comic right
now called What is it called?

3910
04:13:13,310 --> 04:13:14,310
There's this Korean web comic.

3911
04:13:14,430 --> 04:13:19,930
I'm reading right now and I'm like heavily related to it I
was like, oh my god, let me pull it up.

3912
04:13:20,170 --> 04:13:23,130
I've been reading a lot of webcomics webcomics, the webtoons
lately.

3913
04:13:24,250 --> 04:13:26,250
I love the Korean webtoons.

3914
04:13:26,490 --> 04:13:27,030
They're so good.

3915
04:13:27,490 --> 04:13:36,090
But it felt like, if you guys ever read Reborn Rich, that's
basically, in terms of, like, the family corporate dynamics

3916
04:13:36,090 --> 04:13:44,570
and stuff, that's sort of how like, you, it's like, you can
really trust your extended family-type deal.

3917
04:13:46,930 --> 04:13:54,650
It's called Reborn Rich, and it's like, it felt like, it's
how, like, you can't really trust your extended family

3918
04:13:54,650 --> 04:14:02,770
because there's always like a hidden motive to like
everything they're doing and that was so fucking exhausting

3919
04:14:02,770 --> 04:14:16,510
it was so exhausting in that family it's a really it's very
it's a really good webtoon i highly recommend it because it

3920
04:14:16,510 --> 04:14:17,490
teaches you a lot

3921
04:14:22,170 --> 04:14:31,610
it teaches you a lot about it but i really do appreciate
like everyone's i think without this career like the path i

3922
04:14:31,610 --> 04:14:39,990
went with and then without my dragoons you guys your support
um and everything i wouldn't be able to like i guess like

3923
04:14:39,990 --> 04:14:49,230
branch off from that dynamic and be able to be my own person
type deal i really appreciate it guys like it really does

3924
04:14:49,230 --> 04:14:59,030
mean a lot because like i said your support and like this
community I wouldn't be able to like I guess be independent

3925
04:14:59,030 --> 04:15:08,470
for the first time and like like fully fully independent for
the first time and just be my own person because like

3926
04:15:08,470 --> 04:15:18,510
majority of my life was there it was like mostly just be
doing whatever like whatever my parents or like my extended

3927
04:15:18,510 --> 04:15:29,550
family wanted and like I can just be me now which is really
nice I like that like even in university the degree I went

3928
04:15:29,550 --> 04:15:36,530
for was just to benefit my family I didn't get to really
study the thing I really want I mean I didn't even know what

3929
04:15:36,530 --> 04:15:48,530
I wanted to study to be fair I won't say what I studied in
um but um what I ended up double majoring I did major and

3930
04:15:48,530 --> 04:15:56,450
minor, but what I went for my major and minor was for what
my, was for the benefit of my family slash extended family,

3931
04:15:57,130 --> 04:16:02,850
because I went in there being like, oh, um, this can help my
grandpa a lot.

3932
04:16:03,710 --> 04:16:08,490
And then like, I, or like this can help my family and
extended family a lot going into it.

3933
04:16:08,710 --> 04:16:10,830
And I didn't really know what I wanted to study.

3934
04:16:11,310 --> 04:16:15,650
So I was just like, I'll just study this because this will
help my family.

3935
04:16:16,170 --> 04:16:16,170
Like,

3936
04:16:21,330 --> 04:16:26,230
yeah so i didn't even know like i don't even know what i
actually would have wanted to study because i just did

3937
04:16:26,230 --> 04:16:34,650
whatever my parents slash extended family what what would
benefit my family slash extended family the most i will say

3938
04:16:34,650 --> 04:16:45,930
i didn't do medicine i was not smart i almost failed math

4000
04:22:01,730 --> 04:22:01,890

04:22:01,890 --> 04:22:02,690

4008
04:22:16,910 --> 04:22:18,070
I am looking...

4009
04:22:25,330 --> 04:22:27,070
I'm looking, watching the video.

4010
04:22:29,110 --> 04:22:29,150
Cheba.

4011
04:22:29,350 --> 04:22:29,630
Oh, yeah.

4012
04:22:29,710 --> 04:22:30,890
I am not a Cheba.

4013
04:22:31,490 --> 04:22:32,590
For those who are wondering.

4014
04:22:34,410 --> 04:22:36,530
That's pretty suspicious, Joki.

4015
04:22:36,990 --> 04:22:41,250
I am not like a Chinese equivalent of a Cheba.

4016
04:22:41,450 --> 04:22:45,070
For those who are wondering, we were not that level.

4017
04:22:45,490 --> 04:22:49,530
We were not at that level, guys.

4018
04:22:49,770 --> 04:22:50,610
We were not.

4019
04:22:52,470 --> 04:22:54,110
That's what they all say.

4020
04:22:57,690 --> 04:23:04,050
that's what a chamber say like those that's what i read in
my webtoons where they fake and pretend to be a regular

4021
04:23:04,050 --> 04:23:12,030
person and then like those like the that's what that's what
they say in the romance team romance mawan tv dramas where

4022
04:23:12,030 --> 04:23:18,950
the guy or the girl is a secretly a chamber and they're
chasing after a regular person so they have to pretend to be

4023
04:23:18,950 --> 04:23:25,150
a regular person so that they they don't they don't want the
other guy to take advantage of the fact that they are a

4024
04:23:25,810 --> 04:23:35,710
Yeah, and then they run into a poor person and then they
fall in love.

4025
04:23:35,990 --> 04:23:36,090
Yeah.

4026
04:23:39,690 --> 04:23:40,810
That sounds real.

4027
04:23:40,890 --> 04:23:50,290
That's literally, that's literally like 90% of the Korean
webtoons, Korean webtoons and romance TV dramas where one

4028
04:23:50,290 --> 04:23:51,790
guy is secretly a Cheba.

4029
04:23:51,790 --> 04:24:07,510
A Cheba is basically, basically like, so in Korea, they are
like large, so a lot of like very big businesses in Korea

4030
04:24:07,510 --> 04:24:14,190
are mostly like family-owned conglomerates, so they would
have a monopoly on specific businesses, and they're known as

4031
04:24:14,190 --> 04:24:14,730
the Chebos.

4032
04:24:15,070 --> 04:24:21,350
So they are like the top of the top of the top in society in
Korea.

4033
04:24:21,790 --> 04:24:30,530
and uh a lot of the families because it's all family owned
too like it only they only pass it down uh to their family

4034
04:24:30,530 --> 04:24:40,510
and stuff it's always like in the family everything yeah
it's like the top oligarchs and um and uh the the the

4035
04:24:40,510 --> 04:24:47,990
children in there are like basically like everything is
planned for them in terms of like who they married what

4036
04:24:47,990 --> 04:24:54,990
their life is gonna be like publicly wise A lot of them is
like arrange marriages, uh, arrange marriages with other

4037
04:24:54,990 --> 04:24:55,370
chapels.

4038
04:24:55,770 --> 04:25:01,030
So they want to marry other chapels so they can merge, like,
uh, so they can have, like, access to each other's, like

4039
04:25:01,030 --> 04:25:02,410
companies and stuff like that.

4040
04:25:04,310 --> 04:25:15,690
Um, and it's like, I will say, I will say, uh, my fat, my, I
am not the Chinese equivalent of a chapel.

4041
04:25:17,310 --> 04:25:19,890
And we were never at that level.

4042
04:25:21,050 --> 04:25:25,470
For those who were wondering, we were never at that level,
guys.

4043
04:25:26,650 --> 04:25:34,190
That would, like, I feel like if I was a Cheba, or, like, I
don't know what it's called, like, the Chinese equivalent of

4044
04:25:34,190 --> 04:25:34,490
that.

4045
04:25:35,030 --> 04:25:42,310
Guys, I swear to God, I feel like if I was, like, the
Chinese equivalent of a Cheba, like, I would have got docked

4046
04:25:42,310 --> 04:25:42,970
so quickly.

4047
04:25:43,450 --> 04:25:48,510
Like, I would have been, like, what was it?

4048
04:25:50,610 --> 04:26:02,590
uh aliexpress's uh granddaughter actually a vtuber yeah i
like my whole life would have been revealed so easily like

4049
04:26:02,590 --> 04:26:15,850
probably you know yeah literally my time like like there
would be so much publicity being like yeah this rich this

4050
04:26:15,850 --> 04:26:21,810
like oligarch family grand the granddaughter is working as a
vtuber

4051
04:26:29,450 --> 04:26:44,490
oh yeah team what I think the Chinese equivalent is uh let's
see what is it called uh I actually don't know what what the

4052
04:26:44,490 --> 04:26:49,350
Chinese equivalent of that is because like Chepo is just
such such a popular genre

4053
04:26:53,190 --> 04:26:55,990
kai tune where is that that.

4054
04:27:00,310 --> 04:27:01,690
Is that what it's called?

4055
04:27:04,290 --> 04:27:06,070
It might be Kytune.

4056
04:27:06,730 --> 04:27:07,230
Kytune.

4057
04:27:08,570 --> 04:27:08,850

4068
04:28:21,550 --> 04:28:26,970
than you ever have in this fucking yapp-yapp stream of all
things, it's because like I never get to do super chat

4069
04:28:26,970 --> 04:28:34,310
reading or just saxodon streams no more because I'm always
so busy but then like today it was a very short stream and I

4070
04:28:34,310 --> 04:28:36,830
was like, I haven't had chance to talk to you guys in so
long.

4071
04:28:37,070 --> 04:28:39,690
So I was just like, it's, it's trauma dumped.

I haven't talked to my dragoons in so long.

4073
04:28:44,230 --> 04:28:47,750
In a one-to-one session, it's time to trauma dump.

4074
04:28:49,470 --> 04:28:50,830
It's Lord Kroesus.

Thank you.

4083
04:29:01,030 --> 04:29:11,910
I think that's why like, like that's why I don't run ads and
why I try my best to I don't want to like milk you guys you

4084
04:29:11,910 --> 04:29:17,530
know like that I don't know how else to say it like you know
like run spam ads and everything I just want to have a good

4085
04:29:17,530 --> 04:29:27,830
experience with everybody because like for me I just want to
make enough money so that I can so that I can like do the

4086
04:29:27,830 --> 04:29:38,530
things I want to do like do have like a good And like, I
don't care about being like a like super duper fucking rich

4087
04:29:38,530 --> 04:29:39,070
or whatever.

4088
04:29:39,770 --> 04:29:42,410
Or like trying to like make as much money as possible.

4089
04:29:42,990 --> 04:29:47,170
I just want to like make enough so that I can live
comfortably.

4090
04:29:49,010 --> 04:29:54,430
I can live comfortably and like be able to do fun things for
you guys.

4091
04:29:54,750 --> 04:30:01,110
And so being able to like be able to do all these projects,
all these fun events and stuff.

4092
04:30:01,250 --> 04:30:02,690
And be creative in my streams.

4093
04:30:03,290 --> 04:30:08,670
have a good viewing experience because like I don't care
about ad money in general.

4094
04:30:08,890 --> 04:30:14,850
I just want to like because running ads doesn't give people
a good viewing experience.

4095
04:30:15,070 --> 04:30:22,290
I want everyone to have a good viewing experience and I
don't care about like trying to like I'm not sure you're the

4096
04:30:22,290 --> 04:30:29,110
Logan Paul shit you know like you know like that type of
content creation where he literally is all he's doing is

4097
04:30:29,110 --> 04:30:32,550
just trying to make as much money as possible and as fast as
you can.

4098
04:30:32,610 --> 04:30:42,870
That's why don't take like you know i don't like people are
like i try not to take like um sponsors that are like you

4099
04:30:42,870 --> 04:30:48,310
know like you know that's why i also don't want to take
gambling sponsors and stuff like that um and everything

4100
04:30:48,310 --> 04:30:57,770
because i i like i don't view gambling i don't view gambling
sponsors ethically as well and stuff and um and you know i

4101
04:30:57,770 --> 04:31:05,450
don't want to have a good experience i just not here to try
to make as much money as possible as fast as I can.

4102
04:31:05,570 --> 04:31:07,530
I just want to have a fun career.

4103
04:31:08,110 --> 04:31:13,770
I want to have a fun career and make lots of fun memories.

4104
04:31:14,150 --> 04:31:21,910
And then also, and then also like be able to live like, come
like just, you know, comfortably.

4105
04:31:22,510 --> 04:31:24,070
Now I don't want a mansion or anything.

4106
04:31:24,290 --> 04:31:27,070
Like I don't fucking care about designer brands or shit.

4107
04:31:27,150 --> 04:31:28,990
Like I'd barely buy clothes for myself.

4108
04:31:29,570 --> 04:31:30,410
Um, this is also, okay.

4109
04:31:30,470 --> 04:31:36,930
This is also an example why I don't really care much about
clothes or shoes and stuff anymore because my mom basically

4110
04:31:36,930 --> 04:31:44,070
couldn't like controlled like what I wore and stuff like
that to like I wouldn't care what I wear in general but then

4111
04:31:44,070 --> 04:31:51,090
um if I don't you know during like some family dinners and
stuff like I have to wear like like specific clothes to be

4112
04:31:51,090 --> 04:31:57,890
like to look nice and I had to own specific designer brands
to like and I'll be like I just want to wear a gap.

4113
04:31:58,070 --> 04:32:00,530
I just, I just want to wear a hoodie.

4114
04:32:00,970 --> 04:32:07,290
I just want to wear a hoodie and sweatpants or like, I don't
want to wear, I don't care about handbags.

4115
04:32:07,430 --> 04:32:09,290
I don't care as long as it's comfortable.

4116
04:32:09,570 --> 04:32:10,750
I don't fucking care.

4117
04:32:11,430 --> 04:32:14,970
Like, because that's why I grew up in Canada.

4118
04:32:15,130 --> 04:32:25,070
And then when I had to, when I moved to China, when my
extended and like see my extended family, when I do the big

4119
04:32:25,070 --> 04:32:33,090
family dinners, like always have to wear whatever like my
mom wanted me to wear so like she would buy my clothes and

4120
04:32:33,090 --> 04:32:39,830
everything um and stuff like that because like for me
whenever I want to whatever I personally bought clothes I

4121
04:32:39,830 --> 04:32:45,230
just look at it I don't even go to I have changing room
trauma because like I hate changing rooms and stuff like

4122
04:32:45,230 --> 04:32:53,450
that um I hate changing rooms because like when I was
growing up um my parents would make me do like a one hour

4123
04:32:53,450 --> 04:32:59,970
changing room show where I would always have to I, you know,
they, my mom would pick all the clothes she wants me to try

4124
04:32:59,970 --> 04:33:00,310
on.

4125
04:33:00,630 --> 04:33:03,650
I go in the changing room, have to come up, model it for my
mom.

4126
04:33:03,750 --> 04:33:11,110
She makes me turn around all the time, like turn this way,
turn around, look left, look right, turn around, go back,

4127
04:33:11,170 --> 04:33:13,710
change your room, try this shirt with this pants on.

4128
04:33:14,030 --> 04:33:15,790
Then I tried this pants with this shirt on.

4129
04:33:16,270 --> 04:33:21,090
And then, and then it was like almost like an hour of that
in just the changing room.

4130
04:33:24,290 --> 04:33:26,870
And, and like, and it's why I never.

4131
04:33:26,890 --> 04:33:34,110
use the changing room anymore because like i know what i
want to buy and then i know my size i don't need to see what

4132
04:33:34,110 --> 04:33:38,690
i look in the changing room if it doesn't fit i'll just
return it i don't care like

4133
04:33:42,770 --> 04:33:55,690
like i i don't care if i don't if it doesn't fit and it
doesn't look good i'll just return it whatever um yeah and

4134
04:33:55,690 --> 04:34:05,110
and then it's like so like for me like even when i'm like I
barely buy new clothes I barely buy I barely if ever I never

4135
04:34:05,110 --> 04:34:11,710
bought designer stuff for myself like all my designer brands
when I was growing up was bought by my parents or my

4136
04:34:11,710 --> 04:34:19,150
grandparents um and then when but like it wasn't the oh I
the only time I bought a designer shoe that I bought for

4137
04:34:19,150 --> 04:34:27,070
myself was the YXL sneakers because I was in New York City
and I won't really it was just like it was one the shoe that

4138
04:34:27,070 --> 04:34:33,330
actually caught my eye and it I really really fucking wanted
because it was so pretty and that was like one time I

4139
04:34:33,330 --> 04:34:42,910
actually bought a designer shoe for myself and wasn't bought
that wasn't picked by my mom or my grandparents yeah and

4140
04:34:42,910 --> 04:34:53,690
then um and then it's like and then but like now nowadays I
just I don't really buy like whenever like I just wear

4141
04:34:53,690 --> 04:35:00,530
hoodies like I buy my pants and my clothes like my clothes I
buy it at artist alley now.

4142
04:35:00,630 --> 04:35:04,390
I don't really care that much about like fashion that much.

4143
04:35:05,110 --> 04:35:11,170
Like I buy my clothes at artist alley because I really love
like the stuff that artists make because they're all like

4144
04:35:11,170 --> 04:35:20,050
either artist alley or like what are those like not like
they're like markets little art artisan markets.

4145
04:35:20,930 --> 04:35:21,910
Is that what they're called?

4146
04:35:23,670 --> 04:35:31,270
It's not like it's like those like artisan markets where
like a lot of like people who Um, made their like allowed

4147
04:35:31,270 --> 04:35:40,430
like indie, like small business owners and small business
owners or like indie artists make their own clothes and

4148
04:35:40,430 --> 04:35:40,710
stuff.

4149
04:35:41,150 --> 04:35:51,030
So I would just go to artisan markets or, uh, or, uh, artist
alley to buy like clothes or like like sweats, like, you

4150
04:35:51,030 --> 04:35:54,970
know, pants or like, hoodies and stuff and shirts and stuff
because they're really pretty.

4151
04:35:54,970 --> 04:35:58,610
I think are like, you know, I'm supporting local artists.

4152
04:35:58,950 --> 04:36:02,170
I'm supporting small artists and small business owners.

4153
04:36:02,930 --> 04:36:06,190
And I think their products are really pretty and the quality
is really high.

4154
04:36:07,130 --> 04:36:12,110
And then for pants, I just buy it at Uniqlo or Old Navy.

4155
04:36:12,770 --> 04:36:14,810
Like, or Lulu Lemon.

4156
04:36:15,190 --> 04:36:21,470
I will say the only time I splurged by myself for pants is
Lulu Lemon.

04:36:21,730 --> 04:36:24,950

that's why I personally find it weird when I see like um a
lot of content creators flex their wealth by spending money

on like those super ultra expensive brands because it's like

now i mean thank you for the super chat thank you thank you
thank you fatal thank you the super chat thank you thank you

4190
04:41:32,030 --> 04:41:36,750
just a suggestion you probably run an ad whenever you go on
a bathroom break i've seen others do that in your works

4191
04:41:36,750 --> 04:41:41,810
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i think
whenever you run an ad people will just click away and

4192
04:41:41,810 --> 04:41:47,350
that's because like you know people would rather have like
an afk screen than like something like because you can't

4193
04:41:47,350 --> 04:41:52,770
control what ad plays and it's such it like breaks the
immersion too which i don't like because i've had that

4194
04:41:52,770 --> 04:41:57,990
happen before where they're like oh i'm gonna go i gotta go
i'm gonna go queue another game i go to a bathroom and it

4195
04:41:57,990 --> 04:42:05,870
runs an ad and i'm like i'm gonna click away now because
they're like all right just have like i was just like afk

4196
04:42:05,870 --> 04:42:11,310
then just have because i can't control what the fuck ads
what ads are playing what if it's a really shitty ad i can't

4197
04:42:11,310 --> 04:42:21,070
control that and oh my god i can't believe in yapping for
