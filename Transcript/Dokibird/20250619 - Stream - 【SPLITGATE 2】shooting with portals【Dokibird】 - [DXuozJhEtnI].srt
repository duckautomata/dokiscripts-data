1
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,350
Ah, sorry.

2
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,510
Sorry, everybody.

3
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,070
Oh, wait.

4
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,150
Oh, that's my... Sorry, if I sound weird, it's because I'm on my recording... settings.

5
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,250
Okay, okay, I sound better now.

6
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:55,610
Sorry.

7
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:02,550
Okay, now, now I should be... Sorry, I was in my... I was in my recording... settings.

8
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,210
I forgot to swap, but now I am on the right one.

9
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,790
Now I'm on the right one.

10
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,850
But hello, everybody.

11
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,650
I'm back.

12
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,130
Hello.

13
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,070
Sorry, I've been... Oh my gosh, I've been, like, so busy.

14
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,910
I woke up... Well, I wasn't...

15
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,390
I didn't willingly wake up early.

16
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,810
Guess what asshole decided to wake me early today?

17
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,130
Guess who?

18
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,410
But... I haven't been able to record, like, late night.

19
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,750
Like, usually I record at night.

20
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:39,110
But that's when my voice is, like, super warmed up and, like... And I'm, like, usually have the time to record.

21
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,650
But I've been so fucking tired late at night because somebody has been waking me up so early in the morning.

22
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,590
And it's actually making me more like a morning bird instead of a night owl.

23
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,930
And it's... It's so weird.

24
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,090
I used to be, like... Like, you know, I used to stay up so late just working and stuff.

25
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,510
But I cannot... I've... I've been, like, hitting... Being, like, really fucking tired.

26
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,910
Like, at, like, starting at 1am.

27
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,510
Like, when it's 1am, I just have to sleep now.

28
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,630
Like, I just can't.

29
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,990
Because dad has been waking me up so early for walkies and food.

30
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,570
And so, like, it's been messy.

31
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,210
And I don't have... Usually, like, I would nap in between if he does that.

32
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:26,970
But I haven't had the time to nap these days because I've been so busy in between my streams.

33
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,890
Or, like, you know, before my streams, I have to do work stuff.

34
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,170
And then after my streams, I also have to do work stuff.

35
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:38,670
So, there's just so much stuff going on for June and July that I haven't been able to get any naps in.

36
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,350
And I've been mostly, like, working in the morning.

37
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,170
Which sucks because my usual recording time is at night.

38
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:51,710
And because I can't record at night, I'm only... I only have, like... Oh my gosh, I'm so close to finishing it, too.

39
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,930
That's what sucks the most because I'm really close to finishing my recordings.

40
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,250
But I've been stalled because some... Someone keeps waking me up in the morning!

41
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,710
That it's very hard to finish it at night!

42
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,750
Also, you know when I said he's grown smarter every fucking day?

43
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,330
He now knows.

44
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,210
He knows now.

45
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,310
He knows I don't turn on the bar collar.

46
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,590
He fucking knows.

47
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,470
It took him, like... It took him, like, five years.

48
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,110
But he's now knows.

49
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,570
He won the war!

50
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,410
Or six, sorry.

51
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,750
It took him six fucking years.

52
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,250
But he knows now.

53
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,170
He...

54
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:49,050
Because... Because this fucker tried to wake me up at five in the morning to eat food.

55
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:58,330
Because... When he was at the vet, the vet told me because he was sedated for one of his tests during his checkup.

56
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,790
Um... That... For me to feed him half of what he usually eats.

57
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,790
So... Uh... So, obviously, Dad was, like, extra hungry in the morning.

58
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,450
So, he was like, you know what?

59
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,270
I wanna be fed at five in the fucking morning!

60
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,290
And I was like, no!

61
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,970
And then, okay, you know what he does now?

62
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,590
He doesn't sleep with me anymore.

63
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,330
He doesn't, like, sleep in the bed next to me anymore.

64
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,510
Because he knows.

65
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,150
He knows that I will show him the bar collar if he tries to wake me up.

66
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,270
So, you know where he sleeps?

67
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,330
He sleeps outside in the living room.

68
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,670
And I have three beds for him.

69
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,410
But he sleeps in his other bed in the living room.

70
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,070
And then he barks at me at the comfort of his own bed.

71
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,190
So, I would have to get up and look at him in the eyes.

72
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,710
And say, no!

73
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,510
And he'll be like, you're already up anyway.

74
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,670
He's gonna be like, well, you're already up anyway, so you might as well feed me.

75
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,890
Because you got up.

76
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,310
I know you're not tired anymore.

77
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,690
Because you got up.

78
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,870
I'm like, no!

79
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,590
Because I look at the time.

80
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,990
I grab my fucking phone.

81
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,790
And it's like, 5 a.m.

82
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,790
And I'd be like, no!

83
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,570
And then I'd go back to bed.

84
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,830
And then he keeps barking.

85
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,730
He's like, bitch, I know you're not sleeping.

86
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,770
I know you might as well feed me.

87
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,490
Since you're up, you might as well feed me if you want me to stop.

88
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,410
So then I was like, that's it!

89
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,490
And then I make him wear the collar.

90
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,910
Like, I don't turn it on.

91
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,630
I make him wear the collar.

92
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,590
So he thinks in his head.

93
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,410
And then, but then he realized.

94
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,850
Then I went back to bed.

95
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,250
But then he realizes, wait, you haven't turned this on in 6 plus years.

96
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,050
I'm gonna test my theory up.

97
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,510
So then, he starts doing little barks.

98
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,110
He's like, wow, wow.

99
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,190
And then, and then it starts to get louder.

100
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,350
He's like, oh, oh.

101
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,490
And then he realizes, wait, it's not on.

102
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,330
He, he cracked the code.

103
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,290
He tested his theory.

104
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,750
And it was correct.

105
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,450
And then, and then the moment it clicked in his head.

106
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,290
That's never been on.

107
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,870
He, he called my bluff.

108
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,630
And then he started barking louder.

109
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,810
And then I checked my phone.

110
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,710
It's 6 in the morning.

111
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,050
He let me sleep for an hour.

112
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,250
And then he was like, that's it.

113
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,610
I'm gonna crack this code.

114
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,470
I'm gonna call your fucking bluff.

115
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,410
And then at that point, I've given up.

116
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,170
I, at that point, I'm like, I, like he won.

117
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,290
He won the war.

118
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,190
I, I knew that was the only way to shut him up.

119
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,350
I, there was no other way to sleep.

120
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,690
I, I was so tired.

121
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,430
So, so I gave him his food.

122
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,430
And then I went back to bed.

123
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,550
I still kept the collar on him.

124
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,390
Just to see like, maybe like, he'll forget.

125
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,510
And then he wakes me up.

126
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,450
Two hours later, it's now 8am.

127
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,050
And he was like, you know what time it is, Doki?

128
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,790
It's Walkie's time.

129
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,150
And you think I, you think I forgot?

130
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,270
Like, you don't turn on this collar?

131
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,670
That's like, you're right.

132
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,370
I know now.

133
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,130
So...

134
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,150
So...

135
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,930
Because he woke me up early in the morning.

136
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,870
I figured it's time to get some work done.

137
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,810
And do some of my recordings that I needed to finish.

138
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,170
Um...

139
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,570
Uh, yes.

140
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,490
And then I was telling my manager about it.

141
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,670
I was like, yeah.

142
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,950
Like, he knows now.

143
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,050
Like...

144
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,690
He has so much more energy than before.

145
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,550
Uh, before he...

146
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,230
I understand.

147
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,190
Like, I guess like, he has like, a new outlook in life ever since he broke his back.

148
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,030
Because he has so much fucking energy.

149
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,130
Uh...

150
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,950
Like, he would bark at me at random times.

151
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,170
I don't know why.

152
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,510
I don't know if it's for attention or he just wants to use up his energy or he's bored.

153
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,370
But...

154
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,150
I miss when dad would just sleep.

155
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:37,990
Ha ha ha ha.

156
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,970
All the time.

157
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:39,810
I...

158
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,270
He's...

159
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,470
He's trying to live his best life now.

160
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,430
I...

161
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,650
I remember the good old days.

162
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,630
When he was just sleeping.

163
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,570
Like...

164
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,150
80% of the time.

165
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,190
When I'm working or doing anything.

166
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,470
And now...

167
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,150
Now...

168
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,370
Now he's like, demanding me to do stuff with him.

169
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,150
Uh...

170
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,370
Ha ha ha ha ha.

171
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,110
Ha ha ha ha.

172
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,910
When...

173
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,130
When he used to not do that.

174
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,970
Uh...

175
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,770
Ha ha ha ha.

176
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,230
Ha ha ha.

177
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,010
Uh...

178
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:10,970
Um...

179
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,170
I miss when he was basically a cat.

180
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,150
But like, in a dog form.

181
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,850
That...

182
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,730
Ha ha ha ha.

183
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,920
Ha ha ha.

184
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,800
Um...

185
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,100
Anyway.

186
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,020
I'll tell my manager about how he just...

187
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,940
Uh...

188
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,580
He just...

189
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,960
He just wants to like...

190
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,860
He just has too much energy these days.

191
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,700
Um...

192
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,100
Especially when I'm super busy.

193
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,180
And then my manager was like...

194
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,260
Okay.

195
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,840
This might be a really...

196
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,740
Good idea.

197
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,680
Or a really, really bad idea.

198
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,100
And...

199
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,800
And...

200
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,400
I was like...

201
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,080
What is it?

202
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,140
And he was like...

203
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,560
Maybe get another dog.

204
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
Ha ha ha ha.

205
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,420
Ha ha ha ha.

206
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,660
Ha ha ha ha.

207
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:48,700
Ha ha ha.

208
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,700
So...

209
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,040
And he was like...

210
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,920
Hear me out.

211
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,460
If there is another dog...

212
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,580
If there is another dog...

213
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,140
Then like...

214
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,840
Him and the other dog...

215
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,100
Might...

216
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,160
You know...

217
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,820
Use up all their energies...

218
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,240
Together.

219
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,260
So like...

220
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,080
He won't need you...

221
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,160
To help...

222
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:04,940
You know...

223
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,360
Help...

224
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,620
You know...

225
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,800
Get attention and stuff.

226
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,280
But then...

227
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,380
The really bad part...

228
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,200
Is that...

229
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,660
They might gang up on you.

230
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,420
Ha ha ha.

231
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:13,880
Ha ha ha.

232
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,900
They might work together...

233
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,200
And...

234
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,620
Gang up on you.

235
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,740
If it doesn't work out.

236
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
So, double the trouble.

237
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,440
For them, it'll be double the fun.

238
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,360
So, um, and then, because, like, my manager was like, maybe you can get another wiener dog.

239
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,160
And I was, like, thinking, like, he's already really fucking loud.

240
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,700
If I get another wiener dog, it's gonna sound like a tank is living in my home.

241
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,240
And they both, high risk, high reward.

242
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,820
So, I'm just thinking, like, oh my, if they bark together, it'll sound like a fucking explosion in my apartment.

243
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,920
So, I thought about it.

244
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,160
I was tempted.

245
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,940
Because I was, like, high risk, high reward, you know?

246
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,880
I was, like, if it works, yay.

247
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,220
Yay.

248
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,560
I...

249
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,020
Yay.

250
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
But if it doesn't work, I'm never sleeping again.

251
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,940
Nova, thank you for the super chat.

252
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,420
Thank you.

253
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,120
Thank you.

254
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,240
Dad be like, I beat death.

255
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,280
I can live how I want.

256
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,840
Mr. Broken Bond, thank you for the super chat.

257
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,160
Thank you.

258
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,600
Thank you.

259
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,700
Dad at the foot of bed, just staring.

260
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,040
Daring you to prove it even right.

261
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,980
Fado Guys, I really miss sleeping, guys.

262
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,220
I don't know what to do anymore.

263
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,120
I even thought about getting another dog.

264
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,840
That's how desperate I am.

265
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,920
I was like, new friend.

266
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,780
I'm like, maybe new friend will fix this.

267
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,160
That was how desperate I was.

268
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,780
I was looking for dogs at the... I was looking at the adoption websites.

269
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,940
Because I was like, I'm not getting a baby dog.

270
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,660
I cannot.

271
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,360
I cannot retrain.

272
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,840
I cannot train a baby dog.

273
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,260
I can't potty train something right now.

274
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,160
I can't deal with baby dogs.

275
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,100
Puppies?

276
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,500
Sorry.

277
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,820
I was like, what the fuck is a baby dog?

278
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:59,340
I can't deal with potty training a puppy and also going through their eating everything phase.

279
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't know.

280
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,940
For those who are like... For those who like raised a puppy, not like older dogs.

281
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,480
Puppies go through a stage where they start biting everything.

282
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,440
Even walls.

283
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,500
Yeah.

284
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,740
The biting phase.

285
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,300
They would chew on walls.

286
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,980
They would chew on wires.

287
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,020
It's hell.

288
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,800
I don't want to go through that again.

289
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,340
Dad had that phase.

290
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,380
He started chewing on fucking walls.

291
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,660
And like eating walls.

292
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,980
And I... During that phase.

293
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,920
The teasing phase.

294
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,520
And I do not want to grow up with... I don't know.

295
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,120
I was like, I don't want to deal with that at the moment.

296
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,140
So like, I was trying to look through...

297
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,580
Like adoption websites.

298
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,800
Trying to find like, uh... Like, you know, like older dogs.

299
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,680
And like see if I could get like, maybe an older wiener dog.

300
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,120
But then I was like, silly me.

301
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,280
Why would... Like, usually wiener dogs do not get put in the pound.

302
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,080
And you have to get wiener dogs at like breeders.

303
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,700
Or like, um...

304
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,860
Yeah, like, you know, at... For breeders and stuff.

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,780
Because you'll never...

306
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,300
Because, you know, they're very expensive.

307
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,800
So why... They usually don't throw them...

308
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,300
Not throw them.

309
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,380
That sounds so fucked up.

310
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,040
Sorry.

311
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,560
That sounds really fucked up.

312
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,580
They don't usually put them up for adoption.

313
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,900
Because they're so expensive to own.

314
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,740
So...

315
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,180
So...

316
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,380
There was no wiener dogs in the adoption website.

317
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,580
So I was looking through...

318
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,900
So it's usually allowed them just, uh...

319
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,820
Put them... Like, you know, you can only get them.

320
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,200
Um...

321
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,120
You only get them when they're like puppies.

322
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,160
Most of the time.

323
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,600
And it's like, when they are...

324
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,040
When they are in the pound.

325
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,480
They like get snatched up so quickly.

326
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,740
Or there'll be like hundreds of applications for wiener dogs.

327
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,660
Because, um...

328
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,760
Because of how the man...

329
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,100
Like how in demand they are.

330
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,080
Uh...

331
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,480
Golden Helm.

332
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,400
Thank you for the super chat.

333
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,720
Thank you.

334
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,240
Thank you.

335
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,960
I have eight cats and a dog.

336
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,440
Pets are a pyramid scheme.

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,460
Don't do it, Doki.

338
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,920
Thank you for the super chat.

339
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,300
Thank you.

340
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,960
Thank you.

341
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,500
Um...

342
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,200
Lord Kurosus.

343
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,080
Thank you for the super chat.

344
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,440
Thank you.

345
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,220
Thank you.

346
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,440
Female dog owner.

347
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,200
Thought process.

348
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,180
I am exhausted with one sassy dog.

349
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,020
Better get a second.

350
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,940
So I never sleep again.

351
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,800
Thank you for the super chat.

352
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,140
Thank you.

353
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,540
Thank you.

354
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,000
Okay.

355
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,500
My thought process is that maybe they'll like loop each other to...

356
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,640
And then they'll get tired.

357
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,100
That's my thought process.

358
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,240
Like if they just like look at each other and they like, you know, just play with each other.

359
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,460
And then eventually they'll get tired together.

360
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,980
That's my thought process.

361
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,020
And then I figured out, like, wait, no, they'll just start ganging up on me because they know I'm weak.

362
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,700
Lord Kuro says, thank you for the super chat.

363
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,560
Thank you.

364
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,060
And second dog, does that mean we get another mascot?

365
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,840
Maybe.

366
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,600
I don't know.

367
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,620
This was, I was desperate, okay?

368
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,040
I was not okay when, like, my manager brought that up.

369
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,440
I was looking for any solution.

370
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,560
Like, at that point, they could make me do anything at that point.

371
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,580
I was so tired.

372
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,880
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

373
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,200
Thank you.

374
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,800
Thank you.

375
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,200
Just get a pet rock, Doki.

376
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,760
Easiest animal to train.

377
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,960
Thank you for the super chat.

378
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,280
Thank you.

379
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,860
Thank you.

380
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,080
Okay, this is really fucked up to say, but you know, like, those torture methods where you...

381
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:34,720
Like, there's actually a torture method where you deprive sleep out of, like, prisoners until they'll, like, agree to anything.

382
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,160
That's me right now.

383
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,340
Like, I'll say yes to anything.

384
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:48,460
That is, like, slowly depriving me of so much sleep that I'm very suspectable to anything.

385
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,680
Um, Ryan, thank you for the super chat.

386
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,240
That's why, that's why people... Okay, this is why, like, people are, like, torture doesn't really work.

387
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,000
Because, like, when somebody is pushed to the limit, they'll just say yes and agree to anything.

388
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,920
Even if, like, they didn't do it.

389
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,460
Because they just want the thing to stop.

390
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,860
That's me right now.

391
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,500
That... That is... That is me.

392
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,480
So, in that... So, like, in that way, torture doesn't work.

393
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,780
Because I would say yes to anything.

394
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,420
Brian, thank you for the super chat.

395
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:24,720
Thank you.

396
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,240
Thank you.

397
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,540
That's the same thought process that leads to some people having, like, four kids under four.

398
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,420
Yeah, but it, like, sort of works.

399
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,340
It sucks to be the firstborn, but, like...

400
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,840
You know, like, those parents who were, like...

401
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,920
Who are, like, oh, I can't take care of this child.

402
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,920
I... I... I... They're, like, oh, I want to have another kid.

403
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,060
But, like... Oh, I want to have another kid.

404
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,040
And then, don't worry.

405
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,040
The older kid is going to take care of the younger kid.

406
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,340
So, it feels like I'm taking care of one child.

407
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,200
Like, that's the thought process.

408
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,360
And then the mom... The parents would be, like, oh, that was fun.

409
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,960
Let me have a third child.

410
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,220
And then the secondborn will take care of the youngest one.

411
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,140
And then the oldest one will take care of...

412
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,200
We'll look after the two.

413
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,500
And then, and then the oldest child just has trauma the entire time.

414
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,880
So like, that's alright.

415
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,160
One, two out of three.

416
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,680
I was that kid.

417
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,160
Two out of three came out alright.

418
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,300
The oldest one might not.

419
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:37,020
And then, you know, they save money because they pass down, pass down like, like, hand-me-down clothes and electronics.

420
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,040
That's how it worked for Century.

421
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,760
Two out of three success.

422
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,960
Yeah, not the youngest though.

423
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,960
That's just, and then I'm, guys, is it noticeable that I'm an only child?

424
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,700
I didn't have to go through that trauma.

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,440
Yippee!

426
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,580
And then the younger ones will be traumatized and renecestable since they get, and never get anything new.

427
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,100
But yeah, I was planning on doing that before my dogs, you know?

428
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:20,060
Like, instead I'll have like, another dog, and then my older dad will just look after the younger dog.

429
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,400
And then, and then they'll tire each other up.

430
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,160
And then I hope that they don't learn to work together to fuck me over.

431
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,720
So that was like, my thought process.

432
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,420
So it could be a really good idea, or a very, very, very terrible idea.

433
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,720
Anyway, let's go play Splitgate 2!

434
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,820
I never had a chance to play Splitgate 1.

435
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,320
I heard a lot of things about both games.

436
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,920
Apparently, Splitgate 1 is the better game in comparison to Splitgate 2.

437
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,200
But Splitgate 1 is a much more dead game compared to Splitgate 2.

438
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,880
And there are some issues with Splitgate 2.

439
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,520
I thought it was funny that they added a Battle Royale portion to it.

440
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,320
Especially after the devs during the announcement for the game.

441
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,160
They were like, I'm here to make games better.

442
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,860
And, like, bring back, like, games like Halo.

443
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,160
And we won Titanfall 3.

444
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:33,580
And then he... I just thought that it was so funny that he was like, I... I won... I won Titanfall 3!

445
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,420
Anyway, we added Battle Royale in Splitgate 2!

446
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,050
I thought that was so fucking funny.

447
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,730
I was like, bro, look... Bro, what the fuck?

448
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,170
And why...

449
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,250
Wait, why...

450
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:47,790
Okay.

451
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:54,450
Maybe don't talk about Titanfall 3 if you're gonna add Battle Royale to Splitgate 2.

452
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,190
Like, bro.

453
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,130
Bro took 30 steps.

454
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:04,750
Pat.

455
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,410
Ozzy, thank you about Super Chat.

456
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,230
Thank you, thank you.

457
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,770
The older child has trauma.

458
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,110
Ha!

459
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,250
Funny you say that.

460
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,770
What are the chances of you playing the common of Addy and Lele?

461
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,970
Thank you for the Super Chat.

462
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,170
Thank you, thank you.

463
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,790
Um...

464
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,370
CB Miracle, thank you for the Super Chat.

465
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,350
Thank you, thank you.

466
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,370
Dad's gonna train all his bad habits onto the new dog.

467
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,850
Happened over generations between my parents and grandparents' dog.

468
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,390
Since one was always older.

469
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,850
He was like...

470
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,350
He sees the new dog comes and he's like...

471
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,350
Bro, let me...

472
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,970
Let me tell you the secret.

473
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:39,850
Ha!

474
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,170
Ha!

475
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:40,350
Ha!

476
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:40,830
Ha!

477
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,650
Ha!

478
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:43,530
Ha!

479
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:43,590
Ha!

480
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,490
I've broken her and this is how you can do it too.

481
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,470
Um...

482
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,410
Thank you for the Super Chat, Miracle.

483
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,610
Thank you, thank you.

484
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,450
Uh...

485
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,790
Chicano, thank you for the Super Chat.

486
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,690
Thank you, thank you.

487
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,790
Yeah, it's like...

488
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,750
When your older brother...

489
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,530
Um...

490
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,410
It took...

491
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:00,730
Uh...

492
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,190
When you're like in the same...

493
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,170
Um...

494
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:03,870
Class that was...

495
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,130
As your older brother...

496
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:05,910
Or sister.

497
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,650
And it's the same teacher.

498
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,270
And you know how some teachers reuse tests and stuff?

499
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,470
So then they'll be...

500
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,630
They'll like pass down like...

501
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,030
Oh, yeah.

502
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,170
Yeah, like Mr. Jacobson's class?

503
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,030
Yeah, bro.

504
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:16,810
Like this...

505
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,230
These are the tests in the syllabus.

506
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:18,950
Here you go.

507
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,630
I thought that was...

508
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,530
That was shit from like TV shows.

509
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,650
I didn't realize some teachers are actually like that.

510
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,630
Where they'll just reuse tests.

511
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,970
Because they're like...

512
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,370
That's alright.

513
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,550
There's only like two siblings in here.

514
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,130
Like...

515
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,090
Like...

516
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,650
I didn't...

517
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,170
But like too...

518
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,270
And then I thought about it.

519
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:43,790
I was like...

520
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,090
Oh, yeah.

521
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,290
I mean if I've been teaching for like...

522
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,650
15 plus years...

523
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:48,750
I...

524
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,110
There's...

525
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,730
I'm not gonna make like new tests every year.

526
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,130
I...

527
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,810
I mean...

528
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,670
And...

529
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,270
I don't...

530
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,350
Especially if like you're a public school teacher.

531
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,250
You don't get paid enough for the shit you have to go through.

532
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,570
Because kids are so fucking cruel.

533
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,490
Like...

534
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,890
It doesn't really matter.

535
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:06,290
They're...

536
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:06,610
They're...

537
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,250
They're already using chat GPT anyway.

538
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,090
Like...

539
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:14,970
Um...

540
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,830
Um...

541
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,550
But anyway...

542
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,170
Lord Crowe says...

543
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,950
Thank you for the super chat.

544
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,270
Thank you.

545
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:19,710
Thank you.

546
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,770
You are now legally required to get a female wiener dog and name her mom.

547
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,870
Thank you for the super chat.

548
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,210
Thank you.

549
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,650
Thank you.

550
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,450
You see, I thought about that.

551
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:33,590
But then, like, the thing is, I heard they still get their periods, even if they get sprayed.

552
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,810
So I was like, ooh... I don't want to deal with that.

553
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:57,190
Like, I... I... I don't... I... Ooh... They... They... Yeah, so... Yeah, even if they get... Yeah, so I'm like, Like, that's the female equivalent.

554
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,070
Oh, sorry.

555
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:58,610
Spade.

556
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,070
Sorry.

557
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,690
Even when they get spayed, um... They still get their periods.

558
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,830
Like, because I never owned a female dog before.

559
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:12,750
So, like, I've always owned male dogs, because my parents refused to get female dogs.

560
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,850
Because, like, my dad would be like, you don't understand.

561
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,970
They still get their... They still, like, bleed.

562
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,650
But then I was too young to understand what the fuck that meant.

563
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,070
Because I was like, I want a female dog.

564
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,990
And then my dad would be like, you don't understand.

565
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,110
They still bleed.

566
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,210
And I... I didn't understand what that meant.

567
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,950
Because I was like, what do you mean?

568
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,370
They still bleed.

569
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,950
So, like, I got... So, yeah.

570
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,810
So, I was just like, apparently some do.

571
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,610
They do not.

572
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,630
No, some... Like, there's a chance that...

573
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,270
Some actually... Actually do.

574
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:53,810
Wait.

575
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,930
But someone in chat was like, yeah, my dog still... Still bleeds.

576
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,150
Yeah, they can... Some of them can still bleed.

577
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,190
So, it's like... It's like, let's go gambling.

578
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,430
Because someone said in chat that, like, yeah, my... My dog still bleeds, too.

579
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,810
Even when she got spayed.

580
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:09,830
Um...

581
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,090
Um... They did it wrong.

582
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,170
The dog... The dog bleed.

583
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:16,850
Gotcha.

584
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,250
It's pretty rare.

585
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,970
Look, I'm not taking my chances.

586
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,030
Like, my luck has already been really fucking bad.

587
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,170
So, I am not taking my chances out there.

588
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,570
To be like... To still get to like...

589
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,370
To get a female dog.

590
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,650
That might still continue.

591
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,410
Because I don't want to deal...

592
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,910
I already have to deal with it on my own terms.

593
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,650
I don't need to deal with someone else's bleed.

594
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,310
I don't need to deal with someone else bleeding.

595
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,530
I...

596
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,330
Who hurt you?

597
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:00,550
Um...

598
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,090
Anyway...

599
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,430
Uh...

600
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,710
Doki, I think your dad lied.

601
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,110
I don't think you were the super chat.

602
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,670
Thank you.

603
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,450
Thank you.

604
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:08,910
No!

605
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,610
Someone in...

606
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,550
People in chat said that sometimes...

607
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:11,970
Like...

608
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,190
They...

609
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,150
They've owned female dogs that got spayed.

610
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,030
And still continue.

611
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,370
Like...

612
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:18,730
Um...

613
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,550
Uh...

614
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,070
So, yeah.

615
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,510
I...

616
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,270
I really...

617
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,430
I really don't want to deal with that.

618
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,310
And...

619
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,270
Um...

620
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:25,770
And...

621
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:25,870
Yeah.

622
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,410
Google...

623
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:26,710
I...

624
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,630
Google says...

625
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,050
Weird.

626
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,850
None of my four generations have that.

627
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,750
Congratulations!

628
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,470
You won the gacha!

629
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,330
I don't trust my gacha luck enough, guys.

630
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,210
I...

631
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,910
I'm not taking my chances.

632
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,410
I'd rather...

633
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,590
My dog have no balls.

634
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,390
Than...

635
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,910
Because nothing bad happens.

636
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,850
Like, he's not gonna suddenly...

637
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,890
I mean, like...

638
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,410
Dad doesn't hump things.

639
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,570
So...

640
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,490
I'd rather deal with humping than, like...

641
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,210
I wake up and then my carpet's red.

642
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,510
And I'll be like...

643
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,110
Oh, no.

644
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,350
I don't want to win that gacha!

645
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,170
Um...

646
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:17,210
Dookie, you really want to be a bitch in the house?

647
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:17,950
Gladstone.

648
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,330
Thank you for the super chat.

649
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:19,830
Thank you.

650
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,530
Thank you.

651
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,630
Oh...

652
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,230
So...

653
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,450
Nightmare scenario.

654
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,190
Yeah.

655
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,670
That's a nightmare right there.

656
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:30,890
Um...

657
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,210
But yes.

658
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,630
Anyway.

659
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:32,750
So...

660
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,550
Uh...

661
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,790
So that's why I'm not getting a female dog.

662
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,350
Because...

663
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,710
Uh...

664
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,430
Uh...

665
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,290
Because, like...

666
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:40,830
I was...

667
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,990
I just don't want to deal with...

668
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,050
Lose...

669
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,330
Win...

670
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:44,850
Win...

671
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,490
Some people might say it's winning the gacha.

672
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,090
But I definitely feel like I'd be losing.

673
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,550
And it would be like a 0.1 chance to lose the gacha.

674
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,610
And somehow I'll still lose.

675
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,090
Uh...

676
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,170
Okay.

677
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:02,770
Anyway.

678
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:03,390
Sorry.

679
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,430
We had a long Zazzadon right there.

680
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,650
Uh...

681
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,130
I came for a split gate.

682
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,890
And got gacha.

683
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,070
Female dogs.

684
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:14,850
What?

685
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,910
That's once too many already.

686
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:17,670
That's...

687
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,290
That's once too many.

688
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,670
I don't have time to deal with that.

689
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,230
Like...

690
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,870
I barely...

691
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,730
I barely have time to deal with that.

692
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:32,150
And, like, fucking waking me up at 6 in the morning for food.

693
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,390
I do not have time to deal with that once or twice a year.

694
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:38,890
Like...

695
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:40,730
Okay.

696
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,050
We're finally gonna play split gate.

697
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:43,530
Sorry.

698
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,570
This is a...

699
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,230
This is a long tangent.

700
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,150
Uh...

701
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:50,130
I like how it's called Portal Wars instead of split gate.

702
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,350
Um...

703
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,630
Alright.

704
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,430
Let's just say disconnected.

705
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:53,850
Okay.

706
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,370
Retry.

707
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,330
Let me back in.

708
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,430
6 a.m.

709
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,590
A normal person's morning.

710
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,450
Woe is you.

711
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,670
I'm too young to wake up at 6 in the morning.

712
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,830
I became a content creator.

713
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,410
So I don't have to wake up 6 in the morning.

714
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,030
Let's see.

715
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,210
What's the point?

716
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,870
Alright.

717
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,570
200 friends.

718
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,050
Split gate.

719
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,710
More likes.

720
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,030
Laughy.

721
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:30,270
Thank you.

722
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:30,890
The super chat.

723
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,270
Thank you.

724
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:31,950
Thank you.

725
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:32,750
Alright.

726
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,530
Okay.

727
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,590
You know the moment I got to university?

728
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,730
I picked classes after 12 p.m.

729
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,110
Alright.

730
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,210
We do not need...

731
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,390
Okay.

732
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,710
I'll put it in medium first.

733
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,430
I tried once.

734
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,950
What it was like to take a morning class.

735
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,990
Never again.

736
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,250
I was like, I could do that.

737
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,370
I used to do that in high school.

738
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,990
Like, for like...

739
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,010
High school, middle school...

740
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,330
And elementary.

741
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,370
I could do that again in university.

742
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,630
I was wrong.

743
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,990
I dropped that class after 2 days.

744
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,770
I...

745
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,630
It's awful.

746
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,190
I was fucking wrong.

747
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,070
Okay.

748
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,450
Oh, I forgot to...

749
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:18,910
Where's...

750
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,510
What is this?

751
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,970
Horizontal sense zooms...

752
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:22,150
Okay.

753
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:22,450
God.

754
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,310
Give me a sec, guys.

755
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,730
I forgot to convert my sense.

756
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:25,570
Alright.

757
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,470
Split gate...

758
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:27,610
Okay.

759
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,890
Marvel rivals to split gate 2 sense.

760
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,010
Alright.

761
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,490
Marvel rivals...

762
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,070
Split gate 2...

763
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,490
800 DPI...

764
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,470
Uh...

765
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,070
What is my mark?

766
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,490
1.85...

767
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:45,790
Right?

768
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,810
Is that it?

769
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,110
I don't fucking know.

770
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:48,750
Okay.

771
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,530
2 point...

772
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,730
I think it was...

773
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,970
2.8...

774
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,350
Oh, yeah.

775
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,490
2.8...

776
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:56,950
Alright.

777
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,390
Oh, yeah.

778
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,230
You just Google that.

779
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,630
That's what I usually do.

780
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,410
I think 1.85 was...

781
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,470
1.84 was fine.

782
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,030
Just a little bit different.

783
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:06,970
Alright.

784
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,910
1.2.8...

785
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,250
Let's customize our binds.

786
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,370
Is there a...

787
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,570
Melee bind?

788
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:14,890
Inspect.

789
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,550
Ping.

790
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,190
Push to talk.

791
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,070
We'll do that.

792
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:19,790
Uh...

793
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,710
Aim down sight.

794
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,990
Okay.

795
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:21,290
Melee.

796
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,790
Here we go.

797
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,370
Alright.

798
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,410
I got all my bindings.

799
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,970
That should be everything.

800
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,710
Alright.

801
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,490
I don't know if sound guy is here.

802
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,690
But...

803
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,610
Uh...

804
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,170
Let me know if everything is okay.

805
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,650
Uh...

806
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,410
Enable blood.

807
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,370
Accessibility.

808
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,550
Should be good.

809
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,070
Yeah.

810
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,650
Should be fine.

811
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:40,650
Okay.

812
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,290
Walk up.

813
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,170
Mantle up.

814
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,290
Jump over.

815
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,280
Woo!

816
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:53,600
Woo!

817
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,060
Woo!

818
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,780
Oh, I wasn't even done sprinting.

819
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,700
Alright.

820
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,280
Nice move.

821
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,100
Next up, portal.

822
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,580
Alright, portal.

823
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,540
Oh, wait for the new portal to unlock?

824
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,680
Oh, destroy it.

825
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,980
Oh, E.

826
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,680
Oh!

827
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,300
Okay.

828
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,060
Across the gap.

829
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,160
And then...

830
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,640
Oh, okay.

831
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,720
I'm thinking with portals now.

832
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,260
Wee!

833
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,200
Oh, close my portal.

834
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:24,600
Okay.

835
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,100
Ooh.

836
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,720
Okay, if I'm gonna...

837
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,040
Wait.

838
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,860
Okay.

839
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,100
Um...

840
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,880
I wanna do a new bind for that, actually.

841
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,700
Close portal.

842
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,760
Let's see.

843
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,700
I feel like...

844
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,100
I'm gonna do that.

845
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,440
I don't need to talk to people.

846
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,100
This is more convenient.

847
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,440
Ha ha ha!

848
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,420
And then, if I'm doing that, I think E should be my close portal then.

849
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,160
Um...

850
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,140
Emperor, thank you for the five gifted ships.

851
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,520
Thank you.

852
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,220
Thank you.

853
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,380
Alright.

854
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,160
Uh, yeah.

855
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,300
We don't need to talk to people.

856
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,080
Okay.

857
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,880
And then...

858
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,040
Yeah.

859
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,100
I like that more.

860
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,880
And then I wanna do that.

861
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:09,980
So...

862
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,320
Spawn a portal on the high wall?

863
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,580
Okay.

864
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,020
Oh.

865
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,420
Ha ha ha!

866
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,000
Get out of here.

867
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,080
I didn't see that melee part.

868
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,980
Eh.

869
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,700
I used G and sticky grenade it.

870
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,060
Okay.

871
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,640
Okay.

872
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,160
Spawn a portal on the near wall.

873
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,280
And then spawn a portal through the bars.

874
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,420
Okay.

875
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,440
And then shoot the...

876
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:40,680
Oh!

877
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,200
Oh!

878
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,440
You can shoot the enemies here.

879
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,120
Use your smart wall.

880
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,000
What's that?

881
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,760
Pick up the...

882
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,200
Oh.

883
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:52,820
Okay.

884
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,300
Voice chat.

885
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,360
Hold...

886
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,400
Why is that a tutorial?

887
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,140
What if I...

888
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,720
What if I just don't wanna talk to people?

889
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,700
Oh my god.

890
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,540
I had...

891
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,000
And they're like...

892
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,940
Talk to them.

893
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,760
Now.

894
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,520
Now.

895
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

896
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,100
Ha ha ha ha ha.

897
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:10,780
Ha ha ha ha.

898
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:10,920
Ha ha ha ha.

899
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,780
All right.

900
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,560
What was...

901
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,020
It was like tea or some shit.

902
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,120
I don't fucking know.

903
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,900
All right.

904
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,700
They're like...

905
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,000
You gotta talk to them.

906
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:20,720
Now.

907
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:20,860
Now.

908
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,500
Move to try.

909
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,120
Wee.

910
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,620
I did it.

911
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,500
You shall talk.

912
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,760
Socialize.

913
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,820
Mommy and daddy are worried about you.

914
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,420
Ha ha ha ha.

915
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,260
I don't want...

916
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,400
But what if I don't wanna pick my tea?

917
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,520
Mom.

918
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,980
Get kills at each point.

919
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,420
A career clash where you get to pick...

920
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:49,540
Oh.

921
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,020
There's me.

922
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,160
All right.

923
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,020
Let's try this game out.

924
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,800
And get like absolutely shit on.

925
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,940
Ha ha ha ha.

926
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,120
What is it?

927
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,380
I heard the battle pass was like...

928
00:35:59,380 --> 00:35:59,640
Oh wait.

929
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,340
XQC, Tim, the Tap Man, and Shroud?

930
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:10,100
Moxie, Mendo, Nadeshot, Timmy, Ten, Skump.

931
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,560
Who's winning?

932
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,480
I feel like...

933
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:13,780
Okay.

934
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,520
Not gonna lie.

935
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,840
Shroud's team is like extra stacked.

936
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:19,600
Wait.

937
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,400
Tim's team's winning?

938
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,380
But then there's Tim.

939
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:23,840
Oh.

940
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,180
I guess like he has more...

941
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,280
I guess he has like more fans.

942
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,280
Yeah.

943
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,120
Overall, these guys have the most fans overall.

944
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,640
Because I'm like...

945
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,280
But it's Tim.

946
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,340
Like...

947
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,920
Ha ha ha.

948
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,260
Ha ha ha.

949
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,780
Yeah.

950
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,220
I realize like he has more viewers overall.

951
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,040
Ha ha ha.

952
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,220
So it makes sense.

953
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:47,660
You know?

954
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,300
Oh.

955
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,520
But so it's Sound Guy.

956
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,860
Is everything okay with Sound?

957
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,540
Yeah.

958
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,280
It's just a popularity contest.

959
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,280
Shroud.

960
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,680
Okay.

961
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,080
Tim knows that he's Tim.

962
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,920
Like...

963
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,260
Like Tim...

964
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,380
Okay.

965
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,580
Tim, Naishat, and Skump are like what normies would...

966
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,000
Like normies watch.

967
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,920
Like those who aren't even like into gaming and stuff.

968
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,100
They watch Tim.

969
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,560
Because like he's really popular on YouTube.

970
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,220
Shroud, Tenz, and Timmy are like...

971
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,620
People who are into eSports would watch.

972
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,600
Ha ha ha.

973
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,020
And then...

974
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,800
XQC, Moxie, and Mendo.

975
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,820
XQC is like...

976
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,560
You hate watch.

977
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,380
Ha ha ha.

978
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,700
But also...

979
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,840
He has like...

980
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,520
What is it called?

981
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,440
I don't remember...

982
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,480
Like his fan base.

983
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,440
But there's more hate watchers.

984
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,680
Ha ha ha.

985
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,320
Ha ha ha.

986
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,000
For this team.

987
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,160
Ha ha ha.

988
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,200
Oh, juicers.

989
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,640
Yeah, I forgot what...

990
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,580
Because one of my friends used to be a juicer.

991
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,360
And I...

992
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,280
I judge him.

993
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,000
And it makes me realize how fucking young he is.

994
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,260
Ha ha ha.

995
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,100
He's like...

996
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,500
Yeah, I used to be a juicer.

997
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
I was like...

998
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,700
Ha ha ha.

999
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,520
Ha ha ha.

1000
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,460
Ha ha ha.

1001
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:00,960
Ha ha ha.

1002
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,200
Um...

1003
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,000
This is like...

1004
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,820
The normie...

1005
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,580
Normies.

1006
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,680
Esports.

1007
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,920
And then...

1008
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,600
Children.

1009
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,920
Alright.

1010
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,560
Uh...

1011
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,800
Let's see.

1012
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,340
Oh, is there like different...

1013
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh, there's different classes.

1014
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,780
Wow, but you have to be brought up.

1015
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,900
But guns are pretty close.

1016
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,280
Okay.

1017
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,580
Um...

1018
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,520
I didn't know there was like different classes too.

1019
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,960
I thought it's just portals.

1020
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:24,940
Okay.

1021
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,480
Audio.

1022
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,920
Dialogue can be brought up.

1023
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,620
I'll put an 82.

1024
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,160
UI could be brought up.

1025
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,400
I guess that would be music?

1026
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
I don't know.

1027
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,040
Gameplay is okay.

1028
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:39,880
So...

1029
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,760
We could just keep that.

1030
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,540
Alright.

1031
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,220
What are we?

1032
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,320
We're...

1033
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,260
We're weebs.

1034
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,720
We're the most...

1035
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,400
Normie, weebs, esports...

1036
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,600
Normies.

1037
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,900
We're just like a camara.

1038
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,180
Like, we don't have like a place.

1039
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
We don't...

1040
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,520
We don't have a place.

1041
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,940
We're like a mix of everything.

1042
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,560
Because I've like hanged out with so many different types of communities.

1043
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,040
I've like hanged out with like Normiesphere people.

1044
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,880
I've hanged out with like esports people.

1045
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,560
I've hanged out with like weebs, anime, because I'm VTuber.

1046
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,420
So, like, we're like the most... We're like the normie VTuber gang.

1047
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,640
Support date.

1048
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,640
Oh, this says...

1049
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,540
Wait,

1050
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,400
I like health.

1051
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,840
Wait, which one's meta?

1052
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,420
Equipment recharges faster for you and your teammate.

1053
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,100
I feel like speed boosts to movement reload and regen delay.

1054
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,020
Oh, that's cool.

1055
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,320
Let's try this first.

1056
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,220
Aero is best.

1057
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,500
Yeah, I feel like the speed boost might be good.

1058
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,500
There's equipment too.

1059
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,420
Oh, I need to unlock this.

1060
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,760
Carbine.

1061
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,680
Assault rifle.

1062
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,820
Ooh, fire rate.

1063
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,720
Let's try the car...

1064
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,000
I don't know.

1065
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,340
We'll try tempo first.

1066
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,260
Which one's better?

1067
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,680
Tempo or carbine?

1068
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,570
Try them all?

1069
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,810
I'll try the default first.

1070
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,330
Tempo.

1071
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,070
Oh, sorry.

1072
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:16,530
Yeah.

1073
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,070
Okay, I'll try this first then.

1074
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,910
Alright, let's see...

1075
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,930
How fucked am I?

1076
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,250
Battle Royale?

1077
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,990
24 player onslaught?

1078
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,870
Oh my god.

1079
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:25,790
Let's do the...

1080
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,510
Let's do the arena.

1081
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,650
Because like...

1082
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,370
That's the classic, right?

1083
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,070
The arena is the classic one.

1084
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,150
I heard this game is very, very sweaty.

1085
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,730
But like, the thing is, I'm coming into this game really late too.

1086
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,250
So...

1087
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,250
So I feel like I'm gonna get absolute shit on.

1088
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,290
I don't know if there's SBMM or anything.

1089
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,230
That's the...

1090
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:53,970
That's...

1091
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,670
That's the scary part.

1092
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,990
I don't know if there's SBMM.

1093
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,910
Oh, I'm the only Arios guy.

1094
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,570
Wait, I don't know actually.

1095
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,350
Because I feel like...

1096
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:04,670
Oh, wait.

1097
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,190
What the fuck?

1098
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:06,890
What is he?

1099
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,670
Oh no, is he Arios too?

1100
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,110
Can't tell.

1101
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:12,950
I can't tell.

1102
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,570
Time for hot zone.

1103
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,370
Hot zone.

1104
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,090
Oh my gosh.

1105
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:18,870
I'm gonna be so dis...

1106
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,010
I don't know how to do portas.

1107
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,730
I can't think with portas.

1108
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,010
Time to go out there and show what you've got.

1109
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,310
Whoa!

1110
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,930
Smash it.

1111
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,550
Move into the zone.

1112
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,830
Secure it to score.

1113
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,250
Oh.

1114
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,090
Bye.

1115
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,330
Zone active.

1116
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,130
Whoa.

1117
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,710
Oh

1118
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,280
my god.

1119
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,980
That's not fair.

1120
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,140
Okay, there you go.

1121
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,600
Teamate is attempting to capture.

1122
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,150
What?

1123
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,930
Oh, these are bots, aren't they?

1124
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:51,850
There's no way.

1125
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,310
There's no way these are real.

1126
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,890
There's no way.

1127
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,770
I refuse to believe they're real.

1128
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,790
There's no way these guys are real players.

1129
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,770
Yeah, they look like bots.

1130
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,170
Oh, I guess because like, I'm starting now.

1131
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:10,990
Oh my god.

1132
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,330
Oh my god.

1133
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:12,730
Hello.

1134
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,610
Hello.

1135
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,330
Wait, what's this?

1136
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,410
Oh, it's the bat!

1137
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,070
I heard so much about the bat!

1138
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,930
Double kill.

1139
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,930
Zone active.

1140
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,030
Watch out.

1141
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,410
Watch out.

1142
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,330
Oh shit!

1143
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,930
I wanna keep my bat!

1144
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,050
Yeah, lamb beef prop?

1145
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:34,710
Yeah, I know.

1146
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:35,550
I know.

1147
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,950
There's no way these are real.

1148
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,650
Wait, how do I...

1149
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,090
I don't remember how to break them.

1150
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:43,690
There we go.

1151
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,430
I don't know how to...

1152
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,790
I heard the...

1153
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,030
The bat is like, super OP.

1154
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,250
Hello.

1155
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,530
Oh shit.

1156
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:56,910
There we go.

1157
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,190
Oh, I should be defending.

1158
00:42:59,390 --> 00:42:59,590
Whoops.

1159
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,170
I don't wanna be here though.

1160
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,930
I don't know where the zone is.

1161
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:09,750
Oh, there it is.

1162
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,190
Don't worry, I've got a...

1163
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,070
I've got a bat.

1164
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,090
Boom.

1165
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:14,950
Whoa.

1166
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,470
Don't worry, they're bots.

1167
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:17,610
I can do this.

1168
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,290
Don't worry.

1169
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:21,790
No!

1170
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,410
That's fine.

1171
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,850
Are my teammates bots?

1172
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:37,930
There's no way Parry Stasis is a real person.

1173
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,910
Is this like trying to figure out what my SPMM is?

1174
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,530
I'm lost.

1175
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,030
Where am I?

1176
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,210
Okay.

1177
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,070
They are all bots.

1178
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,170
I guess because I'm like a new player.

1179
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,690
So they're trying to figure out...

1180
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,470
They're trying to figure out where am I?

1181
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,490
Because I don't know why I'm in a lobby filled with bots.

1182
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,650
I'm being lost on my own portal.

1183
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,870
My own portal is making me lost.

1184
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,230
Okay.

1185
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,730
Hello, I'm here now.

1186
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:20,650
Hello.

1187
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:22,890
There you go.

1188
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:23,970
Whoa!

1189
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,430
I should use my abilities.

1190
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,470
There you go.

1191
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,110
Where am I?

1192
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,470
I don't know where all my portals go.

1193
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,690
Oh, shit!

1194
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,070
Oh!

1195
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,190
Oh!

1196
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,390
This is my first game.

1197
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,370
Yeah, I think they're trying to assess where I'm...

1198
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,330
Where my...

1199
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:53,410
Um...

1200
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,750
Where my ELO is.

1201
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,270
For now.

1202
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,840
Did she split the gate yet?

1203
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,220
I'm so...

1204
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,120
Okay, I'm gonna try it.

1205
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,180
No, I wouldn't try the carbide!

1206
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,500
What was my destroy portal?

1207
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,340
Dang.

1208
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,180
Oh, hey.

1209
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,000
I see myself.

1210
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:18,760
Alright.

1211
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,380
Oh, shit!

1212
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,120
Hello.

1213
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,640
I got scared.

1214
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,700
I got scared.

1215
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,020
Okay.

1216
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,300
Where am I?

1217
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,560
Sometimes I don't remember where my portals are.

1218
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:42,700
Oh, shit.

1219
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,240
Yay!

1220
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,320
I'm like, where did I go?

1221
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,580
I don't remember my portals.

1222
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,680
There's too many.

1223
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:55,740
Yay!

1224
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,420
Don't worry.

1225
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,200
Woo!

1226
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,700
Wait, I don't have...

1227
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,080
Okay.

1228
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:09,980
Oh, no.

1229
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:10,600
I have no ammo.

1230
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,340
I have no ammo.

1231
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,120
Give me your gun.

1232
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,100
There we go.

1233
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:17,620
Oh, wait.

1234
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,320
Is that Kraber?

1235
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,100
Wee!

1236
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,360
It's okay.

1237
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,120
I have...

1238
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,060
Oh, wait.

1239
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,380
It's not.

1240
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,860
It's not.

1241
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,260
Okay.

1242
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,240
This is a fast-ass fucking rifle.

1243
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:36,820
Wee!

1244
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,270
Woo!

1245
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:43,490
Whoops.

1246
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:46,490
Hurry up.

1247
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,450
I'll just keep making...

1248
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:48,750
Yay!

1249
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:49,730
Yay!

1250
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:50,730
Yay!

1251
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,510
Give me a sec.

1252
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:55,710
I got a reload.

1253
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:56,790
Yeah!

1254
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:58,290
Give me your gun.

1255
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,930
Woo!

1256
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,140
Watch out.

1257
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,480
Enemy is going for a capture.

1258
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,260
Don't contest it.

1259
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:08,880
What the fuck?

1260
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,620
Okay, there he is.

1261
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,720
On fire!

1262
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,940
Oh, I have to go up.

1263
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,500
There we go.

1264
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:13,600
10 kills.

1265
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,080
On a roll.

1266
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,540
Give me your gun.

1267
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,780
Double kill.

1268
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:17,240
Kill.

1269
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:18,820
Capture underway.

1270
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,600
Oh, I do.

1271
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,640
Oh, fuck!

1272
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,140
Oh, my God.

1273
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:24,700
It's fine.

1274
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,500
It's fine.

1275
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,040
Watch this.

1276
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:27,820
Woo!

1277
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,980
I still have that portal.

1278
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,400
I'll always have that portal.

1279
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,620
There's no way.

1280
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,460
I was going to say, there's no way this bot kills me.

1281
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,780
Wee!

1282
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,640
Bro.

1283
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:49,800
Yay!

1284
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,380
Oh, my God.

1285
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,520
Oh, my God.

1286
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,740
That's sick.

1287
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,560
Woo!

1288
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,660
Oh, shit!

1289
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,820
Okay, that was a...

1290
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,680
You gotta admit, that was a sick shot, though.

1291
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,900
You gotta admit.

1292
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,380
That shot was pretty sick.

1293
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,180
Guys, I'm...

1294
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:14,740
Oh, my...

1295
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:18,880
No!

1296
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,040
I fucked it up!

1297
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,560
No, my boy!

1298
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,230
I'm so sad.

1299
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,930
I'm so sad.

1300
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:36,190
I'm so...

1301
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,630
I forgot my portals!

1302
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,530
He's going for a cap.

1303
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,390
Might need an assist.

1304
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:47,450
Okay.

1305
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,730
I don't know why I was, like, single firing this.

1306
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,630
I keep thinking it's, like...

1307
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,850
I keep thinking...

1308
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:54,990
Oh, wait, no.

1309
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:55,910
This is the...

1310
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,070
This is the...

1311
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:57,550
The tempo.

1312
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,330
Wait, no.

1313
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,470
Are they actually real?

1314
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,370
I can't tell.

1315
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,330
No, there's no way.

1316
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:05,130
That's not a real person.

1317
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,130
There's no way.

1318
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,830
I'm not treating them like a real people.

1319
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,130
Like, why is there, like, broccoli?

1320
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:11,850
No way.

1321
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,450
I was like, why is there, like...

1322
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:15,810
Why is there, like...

1323
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,650
There's no way.

1324
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,670
But, like, why is there, like, steam name things, you know?

1325
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:22,810
That's why I was so confused.

1326
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:23,510
Like, the steam.

1327
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,620
It can be.

1328
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,500
They're not.

1329
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,600
Yeah, but you see the steam icon?

1330
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,800
That's why I got confused.

1331
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,580
Wait!

1332
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,780
There's no way.

1333
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:35,720
There's...

1334
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,800
There's no way!

1335
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,100
They have icons!

1336
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,440
I can't tell!

1337
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,460
I'm, like, fucking around, too!

1338
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,060
There's no way!

1339
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,760
There's no way!

1340
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,110
They have...

1341
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:52,580
They have...

1342
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,220
I'm broccoli-ed.

1343
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,280
We are one round away.

1344
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,380
There's no shot.

1345
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,740
Why do they have steam icons?

1346
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,480
There's no fucking way.

1347
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,440
There's...

1348
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,120
It's so...

1349
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,480
It's so weird.

1350
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,880
Please, don't you?

1351
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,540
I just got off my 16-hour ship.

1352
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,630
They get...

1353
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,200
Holy, my...

1354
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,660
I'm so confused!

1355
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,360
I hope they're real.

1356
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,920
Are they AI-generated steam profiles?

1357
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:31,760
Oh, my God.

1358
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,540
That's, like, crazy if they are.

1359
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,320
That is so funny.

1360
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,200
Bro, they, like, walked in, like, an army.

1361
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,560
So, it could be fake.

1362
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,900
Where are they?

1363
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,880
A teammate is going for a capture.

1364
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,620
Help them out!

1365
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,180
Where?

1366
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,560
New power weapon in the arena.

1367
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,720
Can't tell.

1368
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,420
I actually...

1369
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,260
I can't tell.

1370
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,280
At all.

1371
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,440
Like...

1372
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,500
It's so confusing.

1373
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:12,430
Oh, I'm back.

1374
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:14,470
Okay.

1375
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,930
I don't believe they're real.

1376
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,870
There's no way these guys are real.

1377
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,490
There's no way.

1378
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,300
Okay.

1379
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,060
They're pretty bad.

1380
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,140
I will never think they're real.

1381
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,280
They're...

1382
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,540
They're pretty bad.

1383
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,520
There's no way.

1384
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,280
It's fine.

1385
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,840
You know, I'll fucking ego that.

1386
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,360
Fuck it.

1387
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,580
I refuse to believe.

1388
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,840
They're real to me.

1389
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,420
Okay.

1390
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,220
Hell yeah, I am.

1391
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,060
He has a shotgun.

1392
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:05,920
That's not fair.

1393
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,860
Where does this go?

1394
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,140
Where do all my portals go?

1395
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,420
I can't never tell anymore.

1396
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,580
Wait, where?

1397
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,360
Oh my god, wait.

1398
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,360
What gun is this?

1399
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,380
What is a Gravitaz?

1400
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,380
What the fuck?

1401
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,240
Did I kill him?

1402
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,980
I can't tell!

1403
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,360
Oh, I did!

1404
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,580
Okay.

1405
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,740
Oh, is it like a...

1406
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,020
Oh, it's like a pusher.

1407
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,220
Oh, I see.

1408
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,060
It pushes people.

1409
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,740
Wait, did he like...

1410
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:45,980
Okay.

1411
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,920
No, I was gonna say.

1412
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,060
Yeah, it's like a shotgun.

1413
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,220
I realized what it was.

1414
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,600
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1415
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,420
It took so long to kill.

1416
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,580
Get out of here.

1417
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1418
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:04,640
Whoa!

1419
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,340
That's fine.

1420
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,660
They're not real anyway.

1421
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,920
They're not real anyway.

1422
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,340
Okay, Master Slider should be brought up a little bit.

1423
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,260
Okay, I'll bring...

1424
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,820
Is it just a Master Slider for audio sound, guy?

1425
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,200
Hello?

1426
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,440
I feel like I should use my portals more.

1427
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,500
He's going for a capture.

1428
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,840
Wait, where am I?

1429
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,520
Oh, shit.

1430
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,240
Don't worry, I figured it out.

1431
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,400
I'm not used to playing with portals.

1432
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,240
Heating up.

1433
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,120
Wait, did they both capture a point?

1434
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,000
Oh, shit.

1435
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,040
I'm not playing objective.

1436
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,220
My bots!

1437
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,520
Capture the point!

1438
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,820
Watch out, enemy is going for a capture.

1439
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,240
Team!

1440
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,800
You know I don't play objective!

1441
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:05,860
No!

1442
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,980
I wasn't playing objective!

1443
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,340
Tim!

1444
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,080
I was just...shooting!

1445
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,780
Tim!

1446
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,580
I never play objective!

1447
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,960
How do I talk to people?

1448
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,440
Wait, is there no chat?

1449
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,920
I can't chat!

1450
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,600
Okay, that's it, I'm locking in.

1451
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:33,960
Team.

1452
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,160
Are you... are any of you real?

1453
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,300
Ha haHaHaHaHa!

1454
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,920
Oh my god, what the?

1455
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,160
I don't know, I just want to know if they're real, you know?

1456
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:03,410
Whoa!

1457
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,250
That's the power weapon, I'm grabbing that.

1458
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:12,630
I'm grabbing that, I believe in them.

1459
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:15,910
No response.

1460
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:18,710
They do not say anything.

1461
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,410
They might not be real dirty.

1462
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:25,650
I want to do that.

1463
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:26,390
Oh, shit.

1464
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,250
No, my bad!

1465
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,820
Am I real?

1466
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,280
Okay, the portal is shit.

1467
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:39,920
Get that point!

1468
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:43,780
Oh, my god.

1469
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,360
I should actually use my nades, too.

1470
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,440
Oh, my.

1471
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,560
There you go.

1472
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:54,760
Oh, shit.

1473
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,960
Okay, there you go.

1474
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:01,860
Okay, nice.

1475
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,560
Alright, we're defending.

1476
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,860
You got this!

1477
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,280
Capture underway.

1478
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,000
See you there.

1479
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,020
Whoa!

1480
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,210
Whoa, what the fuck kind of gun is that?

1481
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:15,810
That's a shit.

1482
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,350
That's a pretty sweet gun.

1483
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:21,130
Nice.

1484
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,270
Alright, we got the zone.

1485
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:22,870
We did it!

1486
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:24,490
Zone is active.

1487
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:25,110
Alright.

1488
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,270
Okay, I like this gun, though.

1489
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:29,550
This guy's sweet.

1490
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:30,850
Ten kills.

1491
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:31,770
You're on a roll.

1492
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,930
I've been detected?

1493
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:34,270
How?

1494
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,330
No, don't kill me.

1495
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:37,050
I like this gun.

1496
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:37,630
No!

1497
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,170
My gun!

1498
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,810
That was my favorite gun!

1499
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,700
Wait.

1500
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,360
Wait, is that my favorite gun?

1501
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,040
No, it's not.

1502
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,060
No!

1503
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,560
No!

1504
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,100
Okay.

1505
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,100
No!

1506
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,720
I just got here!

1507
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,450
Oh, fuck.

1508
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,470
What is my team doing?

1509
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,330
Is that my favorite gun?

1510
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:13,150
Oh, yeah, it is.

1511
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,270
Where's the other zone?

1512
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,550
Okay, it's down here.

1513
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:17,990
Alright.

1514
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,070
We got this.

1515
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:23,430
Alright, nice.

1516
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:26,290
Uh...

1517
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,280
Okay.

1518
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,300
My portal!

1519
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,140
Here we go.

1520
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,080
Here's my portal.

1521
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,360
There you go.

1522
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,880
I could be here.

1523
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:42,740
It's fine.

1524
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,300
I'm...

1525
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,460
They don't know.

1526
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,460
Okay, they might know.

1527
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,960
They might know now.

1528
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,040
Oh, my God.

1529
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,240
Please tell me I have...

1530
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,440
Yes!

1531
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,960
There we go.

1532
00:57:59,480 --> 00:57:59,940
I actually...

1533
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,700
Look at that, guys!

1534
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,320
I actually played the objective!

1535
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,440
Okay, now...

1536
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,260
My next game has to be a real game now.

1537
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:06,840
Yeah.

1538
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,440
Nice.

1539
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,600
Now my next game has to be real.

1540
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,620
We finally won against the bots, guys!

1541
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,480
We did it!

1542
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,840
We beat AI!

1543
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,220
Alright, let me...

1544
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,660
Alright, let me...

1545
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,720
Alright, my team is still trying to solve captures.

1546
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,780
Alright, let's go to settings.

1547
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,340
Uh...

1548
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:37,800
Alright.

1549
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,480
I'll raise it up a little.

1550
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,120
Let me know if it's better.

1551
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,300
Oh, change blizz.

1552
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:46,580
Alright.

1553
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,740
Now it should be real.

1554
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,300
It's a purple class starter gun.

1555
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:53,880
Oh!

1556
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,380
Aw!

1557
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,160
Wait, it's gun...

1558
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,180
It's class...

1559
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:58,840
Specific?

1560
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,820
Oh, that sucks.

1561
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,420
I wish the guns were for all the characters.

1562
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,060
Cause I like the purple...

1563
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,460
Okay, these guys have to be real players.

1564
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,580
Like, who the...

1565
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,200
Who the fuck would...

1566
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,560
What kind of bot will willingly name themselves D-Die?

1567
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,120
Wait, oh, there's a shotgun.

1568
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,820
Okay, I wanna...

1569
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,740
I like the assault rifle.

1570
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,820
These guys have to be real now.

1571
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,660
There's no way.

1572
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,720
Who am I playing against?

1573
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:27,360
Okay, yeah.

1574
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,720
Somebody has like a photo.

1575
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,260
Yeah, I...

1576
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,000
You know Swagasaurus Rex?

1577
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:33,780
I...

1578
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,400
No AI can make that.

1579
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:37,380
No...

1580
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:42,380
No AI can have a name like Swagasaurus X.

1581
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,900
That name is way too fire.

1582
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,780
Power weapon inbound.

1583
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,020
Yeah, they're real.

1584
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,870
I hear them.

1585
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:06,980
Whoa.

1586
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,180
New power weapon in the arena.

1587
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:10,560
Where?

1588
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,360
Okay.

1589
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,660
Double kill.

1590
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,780
Zone capture.

1591
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,140
Nice.

1592
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,060
Okay, my team is still somehow better.

1593
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1594
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,560
Oh, what?

1595
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,600
Holy shit, my team.

1596
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,700
Goodbye Swagasaurus Rex.

1597
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1598
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,420
Sorry buddy.

1599
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,780
Not cool enough, apparently.

1600
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:44,880
Whoa.

1601
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:45,400
Whoa!

1602
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:46,180
Whoa!

1603
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:46,600
No!

1604
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:47,740
No!

1605
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,180
Slagasaurus Rex!

1606
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,400
That was me.

1607
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,880
Oh my god.

1608
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,460
I was not paying attention.

1609
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,320
I was confused.

1610
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,040
I was not paying attention at all.

1611
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,440
Cause I wanted this gun!

1612
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,700
Alright, what's this?

1613
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,260
No!

1614
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,500
I just got this gun!

1615
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,100
It gets swagged on.

1616
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,920
I just wanted to use that gun!

1617
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,280
It's so cool!

1618
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,460
It looks so cool!

1619
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,760
It would've been sick.

1620
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:29,980
Alright.

1621
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:30,420
Five.

1622
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,280
Four.

1623
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,220
Three.

1624
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,100
Two.

1625
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,100
One.

1626
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,960
Yeah, this game is super fast paced.

1627
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,280
But it is quick play, too.

1628
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,720
I think there is SBMM.

1629
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,600
So like...

1630
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,290
So like, you're in the range of like...

1631
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:45,640
Okay.

1632
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,700
What gun is this?

1633
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,680
Oh, it's not active yet.

1634
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,100
Okay.

1635
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:50,680
That's fine.

1636
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,660
Oh wait.

1637
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,160
God damn it.

1638
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,780
I want to use this gun.

1639
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:02,400
Bye.

1640
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:07,700
Oh my god.

1641
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,260
There's the gun.

1642
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:12,890
Oh shit!

1643
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:14,450
Oh, what is this gun?!

1644
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,830
That one I picked up!

1645
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:17,450
No!

1646
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,450
Not Swagasaurus Rex!

1647
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,590
I didn't know!

1648
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:30,590
I'm so sad.

1649
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,790
No, I'm pretty sure there's no SBMM matchmaking for it.

1650
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:35,810
I'm pretty sure.

1651
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,550
I'm so sad.

1652
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:43,690
That's it.

1653
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:45,810
Get out of here Swagasaurus Rex.

1654
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,890
Get your ass out of here.

1655
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,410
Oh.

1656
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:54,090
Where did he get shot from?

1657
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:04,010
Where is that cool ass...

1658
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:04,270
No!

1659
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:07,810
It's always Swagasaurus Rex!

1660
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:09,770
It's always him!

1661
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:13,750
That's okay.

1662
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:14,150
We won.

1663
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,130
He's on the hunt.

1664
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,110
He's too flag!

1665
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,990
I want to try the gun out!

1666
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:25,530
We might be like, are you guys real?

1667
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:26,550
There have to be real.

1668
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,010
There's no in and are real.

1669
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:33,050
He's so full of swag.

1670
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:39,970
My ancestors still haunt me.

1671
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:42,410
Also, let me know if this sounds better.

1672
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,470
My ancestors...

1673
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:51,350
They're always here to haunt me.

1674
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,370
Heh heh heh heh.

1675
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:00,480
Okay.

1676
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,150
Oh my god, there's Swagasaurus.

1677
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:09,130
I'm fucking coming for you.

1678
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:11,710
I hear him.

1679
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,190
That's fucking right, Swagasaurus.

1680
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:17,030
I got you!

1681
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:20,810
Wait, that's my favorite gun.

1682
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:22,630
Oh shit.

1683
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,910
Oh my god, get him before he kills me.

1684
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:27,950
No, I can't.

1685
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:29,250
They already despawn!

1686
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:32,330
Okay.

1687
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:37,310
Oh nice.

1688
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,310
Nice, this is the gun I wanted to try.

1689
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:43,190
No!

1690
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:43,950
Oh wait.

1691
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:45,230
Nice.

1692
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:46,950
That was the gun I wanted to try.

1693
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,090
Okay.

1694
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,710
I think I just have to...

1695
01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:00,740
Oh god, he had a shotgun!

1696
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,660
He had a fucking shotgun!

1697
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,000
A teammate is going for a gun.

1698
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,860
No, I had like the split stream.

1699
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:07,700
The gun...

1700
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,920
I don't know what gun it was.

1701
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,000
Okay.

1702
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,600
Oh wait, that's my teammate.

1703
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,040
Oh!

1704
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
Your opponent is going for a capture.

1705
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:22,420
Yeah, you can't AD or some shit.

1706
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,520
I noticed that.

1707
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:25,740
Okay.

1708
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,520
Where is he?

1709
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,500
Oh my god!

1710
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,240
Bro, he fucking beat me up!

1711
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,980
Oh, I wanted to try this one.

1712
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,540
Yeah, that was the gun I wanted.

1713
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,320
I like this gun.

1714
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:44,980
Oh my god.

1715
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:45,840
But I have to reload.

1716
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:48,500
I'm capturing.

1717
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,220
Let me go.

1718
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,480
I played objective guys.

1719
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,320
Look at me go.

1720
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:52,840
Yay!

1721
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,370
I'm like still trying to figure out...

1722
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,440
I'm still trying to figure out the portal stuff.

1723
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,900
The gunplay is fun.

1724
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,000
I like the gunplay.

1725
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,120
But the...

1726
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,860
The portaling is a lot.

1727
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,200
It's a lot for my mind.

1728
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,960
Oh, so it's like an L-Star.

1729
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:23,960
The Phasma gun.

1730
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,240
Yeah.

1731
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:25,800
Yeah.

1732
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,200
I'm still struggling to think with portals right now.

1733
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,120
But I think the...

1734
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,400
I am enjoying the gunplay of it.

1735
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,640
The gunplay is really interesting.

1736
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,840
Do they have a practice range?

1737
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,300
Or no?

1738
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,780
I just feel like they do.

1739
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,060
Uh...

1740
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,120
It's simple geometry.

1741
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,540
But guys, I almost failed math.

1742
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,800
Is it really simple?

1743
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,020
I...

1744
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,600
Guys, I didn't know what a whole number was!

1745
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,560
The swaginator.

1746
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,060
Sif dog.

1747
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:05,560
Bad ping 6106.

1748
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,340
3Q next.

1749
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,180
Okay, it tells you which one's a bot.

1750
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,620
Okay, so it does tell you who's a bot.

1751
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:14,940
Wait!

1752
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:18,580
Wait.

1753
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,880
So like, are you trying to tell me the first game...

1754
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,860
We had?

1755
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,920
Wait a minute.

1756
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,760
Does that mean the first game we had?

1757
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,360
They were real.

1758
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,180
There's no way.

1759
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,080
There's no way they were real.

1760
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,200
There's no fucking way.

1761
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,100
I...

1762
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,300
There's no way.

1763
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,040
Those are real people?!

1764
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:45,660
Holy...

1765
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,100
There's no way.

1766
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,200
But they didn't say they were bots though!

1767
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:00,090
Oh, those are still bots.

1768
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:00,790
Oh, thank god.

1769
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:01,930
Oh, thank god.

1770
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,130
I was gonna go through something.

1771
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,050
I was like...

1772
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,390
If they were...

1773
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,310
Like, cause this guy says they were bots.

1774
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,110
So I was like...

1775
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:11,310
I was gonna go through a lot.

1776
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:12,850
If I found out they were real.

1777
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:14,650
I don't know.

1778
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:15,770
I feel like...

1779
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:16,550
I don't know.

1780
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,310
It's just...

1781
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:24,090
It's just really sad.

1782
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:25,170
Wait.

1783
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:26,770
Someone else picked a bot.

1784
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:31,300
Nice.

1785
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,580
Oh, it's a...

1786
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,460
Did we score?

1787
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,440
What if bot was the clan name?

1788
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,760
Okay, we gotta capture that.

1789
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,860
Can I shoot my gun if I capture it?

1790
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,500
Or no?

1791
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:51,290
Intercepted.

1792
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:53,150
They scored.

1793
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:54,790
Let's get the next one out.

1794
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:56,650
The bot was literally right...

1795
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:56,990
Okay.

1796
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,270
Just stole one from our base.

1797
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:01,670
Okay.

1798
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:03,290
I was gonna say...

1799
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:06,610
There's no way.

1800
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,550
It's like capture...

1801
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:09,850
It's basically capture the flag.

1802
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,110
Yeah.

1803
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:18,550
It's basically capture the flag.

1804
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,270
I'm gonna steal.

1805
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:29,770
Oh shit.

1806
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:30,370
Double kill.

1807
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,130
They just picked up a ball.

1808
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:33,970
That's fire.

1809
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,230
I'm fucking running.

1810
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:37,990
I'm running.

1811
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:40,710
No!

1812
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,380
Okay.

1813
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,200
I knew her.

1814
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,240
Oh my god, he's one.

1815
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,260
Let's respond.

1816
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:56,660
It's fire.

1817
01:09:58,580 --> 01:09:59,440
I got it.

1818
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,600
And just stole a ball from your base.

1819
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,340
It's fire.

1820
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:05,340
They'll intercept, right?

1821
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,260
They're all active.

1822
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:08,480
Wait, can I throw this ball?

1823
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:09,400
Or no?

1824
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,100
No, I can't.

1825
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,680
Your teammate just got a slip ball.

1826
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,660
Please, teammate!

1827
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,740
They're on the ball.

1828
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:18,960
Let's get another.

1829
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,120
Okay, that's fine.

1830
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,240
The enemy scored, but that's okay.

1831
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:25,840
I got a ball too.

1832
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:26,880
Oh my god, we got two!

1833
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:27,300
We got two!

1834
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:27,560
We got two!

1835
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:27,880
We got this!

1836
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,480
Here we go.

1837
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:31,380
Boom!

1838
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:32,980
Yoink!

1839
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:33,960
My ball now.

1840
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,780
I'm fast as fuck, boy!

1841
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,740
Uh, I don't know about this game mode.

1842
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,980
This game mode...

1843
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,760
I guess I can hit people with a ball?

1844
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:47,740
I don't know.

1845
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:47,980
Five.

1846
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,720
Four.

1847
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,540
Three.

1848
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,400
Two.

1849
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,420
One.

1850
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,380
Round two.

1851
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,420
Alright.

1852
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,460
Where am I?

1853
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,060
Whoa, shit!

1854
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:00,620
Aha!

1855
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,680
Didn't get me.

1856
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,420
I'm fast as fuck, boy.

1857
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,120
Oh shit.

1858
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,240
What the fuck?

1859
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,580
Okay, we have one of the balls.

1860
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:15,560
That's good.

1861
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,370
Okay.

1862
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:21,190
We gotta defend him.

1863
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,760
Okay, nice.

1864
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,580
Where is the other guy?

1865
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,220
Where does this take me?

1866
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:32,940
Oh my!

1867
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:34,000
Okay.

1868
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,240
That's not fair.

1869
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,520
Ha-ha!

1870
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:39,620
That's right!

1871
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,400
This fuck doesn't know where I go!

1872
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,720
It's not in his algorithm!

1873
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:45,900
It's not in his algorithm!

1874
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,180
Oh shit.

1875
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,780
Okay, if he was a real guy, I would have died like 20 times already.

1876
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,600
There's a new ball.

1877
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,300
Okay, nice.

1878
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,060
Teammate just picked up a ball.

1879
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:01,600
Thank god.

1880
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,020
Thank god.

1881
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:02,700
Thank god they're not real.

1882
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,080
They're just AI.

1883
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,260
Wait, they took one of our balls.

1884
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,840
Give me my ball back.

1885
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:10,540
It's fucking right.

1886
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:11,920
Teammates, please!

1887
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:12,880
Defend me!

1888
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:16,220
Alright.

1889
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,740
Don't worry, I'm here.

1890
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,660
Don't worry, that's why I'm here.

1891
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,960
Oh, watch this.

1892
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,320
I thought he was safe.

1893
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:26,900
JK.

1894
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,400
That's right.

1895
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,220
Can't get my ball.

1896
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,220
Come on, get over here.

1897
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,960
Oh, I like the movement though.

1898
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,780
The movement is so smooth.

1899
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,100
Wait, who stole it?

1900
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:44,940
What the fuck?

1901
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,680
He distracted me!

1902
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,120
Oh no.

1903
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,160
Bye.

1904
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,680
Where is he?

1905
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,160
I know you're here.

1906
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:56,960
Wait, he died?

1907
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,300
Oh fuck!

1908
01:12:59,260 --> 01:12:59,740
No!

1909
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:03,620
He dropped the ball!

1910
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,780
Oh no, we gotta steal it.

1911
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,240
Oh, they'll have to.

1912
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,980
We have to steal it back.

1913
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:10,980
Oh no!

1914
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,440
They're actually defending.

1915
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,160
That's fine, I got one of them.

1916
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,200
It's fine.

1917
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,940
You don't know where I am.

1918
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,180
They just picked up a ball.

1919
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,460
Oh, he's right behind me, isn't he?

1920
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,520
He's right behind me, isn't he?

1921
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,320
Oh!

1922
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,500
Oh, why is it so far?

1923
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,300
Okay, none of...

1924
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,620
Both teams don't have one ball.

1925
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:39,940
There you go.

1926
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,480
We both scored.

1927
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,460
Okay, we...

1928
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,420
That's fine.

1929
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,560
Oh my god.

1930
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,520
You guys are so annoying.

1931
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:53,570
Oh...

1932
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:55,830
Where is it?

1933
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:56,570
Oh, it's over here.

1934
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,230
The enemy just stole a ball from your base.

1935
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:59,470
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

1936
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:00,810
That's fine.

1937
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,100
Oh shit!

1938
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:06,820
Ah!

1939
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,140
That's fine.

1940
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,460
I got this though.

1941
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,240
Yay!

1942
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,840
We did it!

1943
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,340
Yay!

1944
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:21,320
Oh, that was close.

1945
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,440
That was close.

1946
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:22,880
I...

1947
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,280
I thought...

1948
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,320
I thought we were gonna lose that.

1949
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,040
Get balls!

1950
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:31,300
Okay, wait.

1951
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,680
Are you...

1952
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,080
Are any of you...

1953
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,420
Are you real?

1954
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:43,960
I'll ask that until someone says yes.

1955
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,400
I don't know!

1956
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,680
I don't know who's real and who's not!

1957
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,700
I can't!

1958
01:14:58,820 --> 01:14:58,860
I can't!

1959
01:14:58,860 --> 01:14:59,240
Well done!

1960
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:04,160
New split ball in play now.

1961
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,540
Power weapon inbound.

1962
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,120
Truly they...

1963
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,180
One of them's real.

1964
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,300
Jesus Christ.

1965
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,240
I need to heal...

1966
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,600
This guy in at chat.

1967
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,100
Are you real?

1968
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,580
Oh, where's the power weapon?

1969
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:26,940
Okay, the food bar.

1970
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,760
I'll try the food bar.

1971
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,720
No, I'm not tall enough!

1972
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:34,420
Too short!

1973
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:39,810
I wanted to try the food bar!

1974
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,830
No, I'm not letting that boss steal it.

1975
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:47,910
That's fucking right.

1976
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,570
Alright, you get the other ball.

1977
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:51,270
I'll get this.

1978
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,200
Okay.

1979
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:56,680
Nice.

1980
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:58,620
We got two.

1981
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,280
Okay, I'm gonna grab this.

1982
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,680
Okay, there we go.

1983
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,120
I just need...

1984
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:04,820
There we go.

1985
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,640
Nice, I got the food bar.

1986
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,760
That's a rocket missile, right?

1987
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,680
I missed.

1988
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,050
Are you serious?

1989
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:22,510
Get back here.

1990
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,290
Get back here.

1991
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:24,930
Get back here.

1992
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:25,550
Am I real?

1993
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:33,130
Better question is if I'm real.

1994
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:36,750
Okay, we'll try this gun.

1995
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:37,690
What is this one?

1996
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:41,850
I'm not real.

1997
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:44,170
Oh no.

1998
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:44,850
Oh no.

1999
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:45,770
No, they stole two!

2000
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:47,970
Oh my god, they're so lucky.

2001
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:49,670
I'm trying to do this first.

2002
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:50,790
That's the point.

2003
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:52,490
We scored.

2004
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:54,030
Let's keep up the momentum.

2005
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:57,290
Oh, there's a charge up?

2006
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:58,210
I don't like that.

2007
01:16:58,610 --> 01:16:59,150
I don't know.

2008
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:02,650
I don't like that charge up.

2009
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:08,910
Oh, I don't like that.

2010
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,210
I don't like the charge up for that.

2011
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,310
It's like so...

2012
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:14,430
Yeah, it's so disorienting.

2013
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,390
What's that gun cut?

2014
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:16,130
The Borealis?

2015
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:20,530
Borealis?

2016
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:21,990
Right here in your kitchen?

2017
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,610
Okay.

2018
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,870
There we go.

2019
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:30,330
There we go.

2020
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,750
It's hipfire is accurate.

2021
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:37,650
Oh, okay.

2022
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,910
I didn't like the charge up for it.

2023
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:45,570
In this part of the country, at this time of the day?

2024
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:50,250
Alright, let's try the...

2025
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,390
Let's try the Battle Royale.

2026
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:56,650
Change.

2027
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,210
Alright.

2028
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:00,090
I don't know what the Battle Royale is gonna be like.

2029
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,130
But we'll see.

2030
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,240
And that's what they added.

2031
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,840
They're like, I wish...

2032
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,480
I want Titanfall 3!

2033
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,280
Anyway.

2034
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,540
We just added Battle Royale to split K2.

2035
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:21,720
I want games to be fun again.

2036
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,420
Okay, I...

2037
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,080
Wow!

2038
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:26,980
Wait!

2039
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:29,740
Hmm...

2040
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,660
Someone here...

2041
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,540
Is very familiar.

2042
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:37,620
Okay.

2043
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,420
Put it all out there.

2044
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,020
It looks like a bot.

2045
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,600
You guys think this is a bot, guys?

2046
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:52,760
You think this is...

2047
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,300
I didn't realize...

2048
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,400
His name is in the A- At ChatGPT.

2049
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,180
A dude at Helen Keller.

2050
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:02,700
Ba-da-ba-ba.

2051
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,160
Oh, is this a...

2052
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,680
Alright, so what makes this a Battle Royale mode?

2053
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:07,700
What?

2054
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:14,070
Oh.

2055
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:14,910
Oh.

2056
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:15,750
Oh, it's like guns.

2057
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:16,730
Okay, I'm...

2058
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:19,850
Oh, we gotta find guns and stuff.

2059
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:25,020
Are they real?

2060
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,800
Are any of you...

2061
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,880
Real?

2062
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,060
Are they real?

2063
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,040
Hahaha!

2064
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:32,440
Hahaha!

2065
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:36,080
Hahaha!

2066
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:36,560
Hahaha!

2067
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:39,400
Okay.

2068
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,600
They are real.

2069
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,620
Oh, there's an armor plate.

2070
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,920
How do I use my armor plate?

2071
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:48,300
Anyway...

2072
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,040
What the fuck is my...

2073
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,720
I don't know how to use my armor plate.

2074
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,480
I do already have armor plate.

2075
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,360
I wanna...

2076
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,380
Go into this fight.

2077
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,560
I'm mad.

2078
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,000
Okay.

2079
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:14,700
Yeah, these...

2080
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,320
I don't know.

2081
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,040
They were real.

2082
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,340
What gun is this?

2083
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:21,740
Ooh!

2084
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,980
Bro, I don't know how...

2085
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:28,500
What I'm looting.

2086
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:28,880
I...

2087
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,700
I don't know.

2088
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:30,540
Like...

2089
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:33,500
I don't know what I'm looting.

2090
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:34,400
I...

2091
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:41,420
I actually don't know.

2092
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:42,080
I can't tell.

2093
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,400
What's the drought?

2094
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,260
Oh, there's a chest here.

2095
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:53,700
Whoa, whoa!

2096
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,290
Oh, shit.

2097
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:02,190
Wait, is that...

2098
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:04,830
Over here.

2099
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:17,350
Okay.

2100
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,670
They're not real.

2101
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:19,510
There's no way.

2102
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,970
These guys are real.

2103
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,350
There's no way.

2104
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:28,810
I refuse to believe they were real.

2105
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:29,830
I am...

2106
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:32,570
Literally just standing.

2107
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:36,600
Okay.

2108
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,920
The thing is, I don't know, like...

2109
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,300
What some of these things do.

2110
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,780
Am I supposed to go to the sanctum?

2111
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,480
Where am I supposed to go?

2112
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,130
Alright, lead me.

2113
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:58,450
I have no idea where to go.

2114
01:21:58,630 --> 01:21:59,170
Lead me.

2115
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:07,560
I can't believe Alan's a bot this entire time.

2116
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,880
Like, what is that?

2117
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:16,000
What the... What the fuck?

2118
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,280
They're all lagging!

2119
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,220
What the fuck?

2120
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,700
Okay, they might be real because they were lagging like hell.

2121
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,620
That was crazy lag right there.

2122
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,200
Yeah, weird portal shit.

2123
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:36,600
Wait, what?

2124
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,580
What are we doing here?

2125
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:41,500
The bots have a lag switch.

2126
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,860
There's no way.

2127
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,340
That shit was so fucking laggy.

2128
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,600
Is there math?

2129
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,440
Oh, we are at the end zone.

2130
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:56,140
Okay.

2131
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,500
Wait, are we at the end zone?

2132
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,260
Where's my team?

2133
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:10,470
By the way, Alan never answered.

2134
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:11,610
Oh, you're right.

2135
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:13,670
We'll never know if they're real.

2136
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:15,390
We'll never know.

2137
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,210
Oh, now.

2138
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:23,150
Oh, my God.

2139
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:24,270
The AI is learning.

2140
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,510
Oh, my God.

2141
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:30,370
The AI learned.

2142
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:33,770
Okay, that's the shotgun.

2143
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:34,930
Okay, I'll try that out.

2144
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:37,350
Chat, are you real?

2145
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,020
Wait, then how did Alan get into my game?

2146
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,360
Oh, my God.

2147
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,860
Is he also a bot?

2148
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,080
But this is my first time playing.

2149
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,240
Okay, there's no way.

2150
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,440
Okay, yeah.

2151
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:08,260
He's not real.

2152
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,620
He's literally standing in the straight line.

2153
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:12,120
Okay, yeah.

2154
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,420
I think that Chicky Nuggies...

2155
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,520
I have a feeling.

2156
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,340
The Chicky Nuggies guy.

2157
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:23,920
Oh, I don't like that.

2158
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,960
How about this?

2159
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:33,940
Wait, why is my...

2160
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,400
Why is my heal so bad?

2161
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:39,660
How do I regen heals?

2162
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,340
Why is my heal so bad?

2163
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:43,980
Biome's closing?

2164
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:49,940
Two teams remain.

2165
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,800
Yeah, but one of them is...

2166
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,060
Oh, wait.

2167
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,100
Yeah, there's one full team.

2168
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,140
Maybe the last full team is a real team.

2169
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,700
Four to armor up?

2170
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:01,060
Oh.

2171
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:06,040
Because I have, like, two armors right now.

2172
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,600
Oh, click four?

2173
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:12,540
Oh!

2174
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:14,300
What the fuck?

2175
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,060
It doesn't even show up in my...

2176
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:19,100
It doesn't show up in the notification thing.

2177
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:19,660
You know?

2178
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:20,740
Like, when...

2179
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:21,340
Not notifications.

2180
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,500
It shows up in the...

2181
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,380
Oh, fuck.

2182
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:26,540
My frames dropped to zero when I'm in here.

2183
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:32,950
It doesn't, like, show up in the...

2184
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:33,970
Oh, I want the deadbolt.

2185
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:35,430
That looks like a cool gun.

2186
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:37,970
It's next to...

2187
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:38,570
Oh, it does...

2188
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:39,430
Oh, it's that...

2189
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:40,470
Oh, that's what the four...

2190
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:42,010
I thought it meant I'm player four.

2191
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:43,110
I...

2192
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:44,850
I just thought that's what it meant.

2193
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,530
I thought it was saying, I'm player four.

2194
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:50,670
And I was like, that's me.

2195
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:52,250
I am player four.

2196
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:53,730
All right.

2197
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:54,630
I have this gun.

2198
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,180
That's fair.

2199
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:09,210
Hello?

2200
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:11,090
Any gamers?

2201
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:14,930
We're gamers.

2202
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:17,630
Gamers, where?

2203
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:20,970
Is this a Kramer?

2204
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:21,990
Oh, nice.

2205
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:24,070
I mean, the map's cool.

2206
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:27,810
I just wish there were people here for me to shoot my gun.

2207
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,090
Jesus Christ.

2208
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:32,710
How do I know where...

2209
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:32,830
Wait.

2210
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:33,430
Oh, my gosh.

2211
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:34,010
Where am I?

2212
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:36,290
Oh, what the fuck?

2213
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:41,210
Oh, it's like you're portaling to four different locations.

2214
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:43,210
I can't believe it.

2215
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:44,430
I'm so sad.

2216
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:48,930
What?

2217
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:49,750
Did they leave?

2218
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:56,530
What am I doing?

2219
01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:59,990
No, I just wanted to use that gun.

2220
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:02,330
It's not fair.

2221
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:07,710
Oh, my God.

2222
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:10,790
I can't believe they died to the zone.

2223
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:15,190
Can't believe it.

2224
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,530
Yeah, they keep playing and keep...

2225
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:17,950
Oh, my God.

2226
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:19,150
How long do they keep...

2227
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:19,490
Oh, my God.

2228
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:20,870
It's like Fortnite all over again.

2229
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:26,210
It's like Fortnite all over again.

2230
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:28,330
We have to play until...

2231
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:28,810
All right.

2232
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,810
We play until we encounter real people.

2233
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:32,670
That's not...

2234
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:33,670
That's the goal.

2235
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:40,270
Surely we'll encounter real people now.

2236
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:42,890
All right.

2237
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:44,050
Teched out.

2238
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:45,650
Where's our fourth player?

2239
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:47,810
Why is there three of us?

2240
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:50,210
Oh, there he is.

2241
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:52,550
Okay.

2242
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:54,970
Okay, we got our...

2243
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,650
Bad decisions.

2244
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:00,290
There we go.

2245
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:01,050
We got our...

2246
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:02,330
We got our fourth player.

2247
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,780
I can't tell.

2248
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:10,880
That's the thing.

2249
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:11,780
It's so odd.

2250
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:12,740
I can't tell.

2251
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:16,940
Because, like, I don't know if I'm just encountering really, really bad players.

2252
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:18,780
Or, like, if they're bots.

2253
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,300
Like, it's so confusing.

2254
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,760
Get ready to drop...

2255
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,720
Are any...

2256
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:31,800
Eventually...

2257
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:36,800
Eventually...

2258
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,280
Eventually...

2259
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,480
Eventually, they'll let me know if they're real or not.

2260
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:44,640
That's all I want.

2261
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,860
I just want them to tell me if they're real or not.

2262
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,020
That's all.

2263
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,440
But, like, I just want some simp...

2264
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,220
Something simple.

2265
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,980
Why is that not real?

2266
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,180
I can tell.

2267
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:07,960
Whoa.

2268
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:13,530
Okay, there we go.

2269
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:17,530
Oh, no.

2270
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:19,430
There we go.

2271
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,710
I need armor, though.

2272
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,220
There we go.

2273
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:30,440
There we go.

2274
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:30,960
Beating up!

2275
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:31,480
Beating up!

2276
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:39,750
How do we cancel portals again?

2277
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:40,970
I don't remember.

2278
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,360
I don't remember.

2279
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:47,820
How do we cancel other people's...

2280
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:48,780
Why do I re-bind it?

2281
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:52,920
Are they...

2282
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,280
Are my teammates fighting someone?

2283
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,740
Oh, I punched them.

2284
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,040
Oh, okay.

2285
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,860
Okay, I realize now.

2286
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:08,120
Okay, that's a team.

2287
01:30:12,130 --> 01:30:12,690
Alright.

2288
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:14,670
This guy is...

2289
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:16,190
I don't have to think with photos with...

2290
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:16,990
Oh, this guy is a...

2291
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:18,290
Okay, that guy had to be real.

2292
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:18,970
He was AFK.

2293
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:23,630
He was AFK.

2294
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:26,170
I refuse to believe that.

2295
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:28,230
He was a...

2296
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:29,650
regular person.

2297
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:31,450
Or he was, like, a bot.

2298
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:34,250
A bot would never just stop moving.

2299
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,320
Wait, where am I?

2300
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,600
How do I get home?

2301
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:46,920
Wait.

2302
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,180
How do I get home?

2303
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,320
Oh, my God.

2304
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,980
How do I return home?

2305
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,160
Team!

2306
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,580
My portal locked!

2307
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,700
I'm so scared.

2308
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,480
My portal got locked!

2309
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:27,190
Oh, my God.

2310
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:29,970
I'm so scared.

2311
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:34,530
Oh, no.

2312
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:36,330
I'm all alone.

2313
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:40,760
I see them.

2314
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:43,560
They're all...

2315
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,080
We're all both trying to get to that...

2316
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:45,380
Oh!

2317
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:46,840
Oh!

2318
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:48,560
No!

2319
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:49,480
No!

2320
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,100
I'm so sad!

2321
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:52,980
Oh!

2322
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:55,380
I went through them!

2323
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,280
No!

2324
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,400
I actually went through this red thing!

2325
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,060
I didn't realize I could do...

2326
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,200
And if I...

2327
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,400
Wait, that's me!

2328
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:15,180
Wait, how did I get back?

2329
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,840
I'm gonna die here.

2330
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:18,280
Fuck it.

2331
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:19,200
Whee!

2332
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,500
How did I respawn?

2333
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:24,800
I was so confused!

2334
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:26,040
I...

2335
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,880
Okay, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2336
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:28,700
I'll be right back.

2337
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:50,010
Good kill.

2338
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,790
We're halfway there.

2339
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:13,630
Way to...

2340
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,280
Round two.

2341
01:33:24,830 --> 01:33:27,140
Double damage event is over.

2342
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:34,710
Airdrop incoming.

2343
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,350
Okay, guys.

2344
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:18,670
I understand now.

2345
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:20,250
I understand.

2346
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:25,090
I...

2347
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:25,870
Guys.

2348
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:27,490
I understand now.

2349
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:31,830
Okay, don't go through those random portal areas.

2350
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:33,430
Because they can close down.

2351
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:35,230
I get it now.

2352
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:36,590
I...

2353
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:36,950
I...

2354
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:38,250
I...

2355
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:38,890
I get it.

2356
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:44,730
I was like, where did my team go?

2357
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:46,890
I'm so confused.

2358
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:47,470
He is!

2359
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:50,950
Okay.

2360
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:52,650
We'll drop here.

2361
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:53,610
I don't fucking know.

2362
01:34:56,590 --> 01:35:00,530
I realized red means you can't go anywhere.

2363
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:02,550
You're stuck there.

2364
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:06,010
Okay.

2365
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:07,790
Me get it.

2366
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:10,290
Me get it now.

2367
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:15,600
Okay.

2368
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:18,240
Me understand.

2369
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:22,320
What the fuck is this?

2370
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:24,080
Wait, what?

2371
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:27,140
I don't want to fight this, actually.

2372
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,320
Wait, what the fuck?

2373
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,240
We had someone die?

2374
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,180
How did he die?

2375
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:35,210
Oh.

2376
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,120
Oh, my God.

2377
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:44,580
Okay.

2378
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:47,060
Someone here.

2379
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:53,860
I hear them.

2380
01:35:58,940 --> 01:35:59,880
Oh, my God.

2381
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:00,760
There's someone here.

2382
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:01,200
I know.

2383
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,640
I really want to fight.

2384
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:09,790
I see you.

2385
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,680
I see you over there.

2386
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:19,100
I see you.

2387
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:19,100
I see you.

2388
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,000
Oh, shit!

2389
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:25,830
Goodbye.

2390
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:29,950
Goodbye.

2391
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,720
I'm smarter.

2392
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:47,480
Oh,

2393
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,770
maybe he's smarter.

2394
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:00,170
He might be smarter.

2395
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:07,820
Oh, my God.

2396
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:08,500
Hey.

2397
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,220
Jesus Christ.

2398
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:20,080
I'm getting out of here.

2399
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:23,940
I'm getting out of here.

2400
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:24,540
I need this.

2401
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:29,560
My thing is still there.

2402
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:33,720
My portal... Oh, it's not there anymore.

2403
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:34,480
God damn it.

2404
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,060
It was still there.

2405
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:36,900
Oh, it's still there.

2406
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,080
Okay.

2407
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,060
These are real people.

2408
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,620
These are actually real people now.

2409
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:50,430
I'm actually fighting real people now.

2410
01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:51,190
I'm...

2411
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,320
Yeah, no.

2412
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,340
These guys fight like they're real players.

2413
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:00,860
100%.

2414
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,680
Oh, fuck.

2415
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,440
This is bad.

2416
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:15,070
NOOOOO!

2417
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:19,410
There's too many players.

2418
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:23,830
I have no more shield.

2419
01:38:24,170 --> 01:38:26,270
There's too many players around me.

2420
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:29,410
I'm almost back, though.

2421
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:33,210
Yeah, everybody's just there.

2422
01:38:33,610 --> 01:38:35,030
Like, I couldn't do anything.

2423
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:39,670
Too many real... Okay, but I'm fucking gaming, though.

2424
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:43,250
Fucking idiot.

2425
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:47,630
I'm actually gaming, though.

2426
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,680
I hear them.

2427
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:00,180
Okay, I'm playing with portals for real this time.

2428
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:01,140
Wait, what?

2429
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:02,900
Where am I getting shot from?

2430
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:04,660
I can't tell.

2431
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,620
Oh my...

2432
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:07,480
There you go.

2433
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,460
I need the armor.

2434
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:17,180
Okay.

2435
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,580
Can we go back?

2436
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:19,920
We can.

2437
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:31,660
Nice.

2438
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,580
Round two.

2439
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:36,480
Drop frenzy event is over.

2440
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:42,870
Okay, I know there's, like, people next to me somewhere.

2441
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:44,310
Oh, my God.

2442
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:44,950
Oh, my God.

2443
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:44,970
No!

2444
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:46,250
Oh!

2445
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:48,790
I heard it, too.

2446
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,270
I was like, I hear this.

2447
01:39:50,670 --> 01:39:51,230
I know...

2448
01:39:51,230 --> 01:39:51,590
No!

2449
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:52,450
Come on!

2450
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:53,910
No!

2451
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:54,630
Please!

2452
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:57,120
Come on!

2453
01:39:57,780 --> 01:39:58,380
Oh!

2454
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:00,340
Oh!

2455
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:01,640
I could hear it, too.

2456
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:04,020
I heard a person next to me.

2457
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:05,280
Yeah.

2458
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,320
Oh, my God.

2459
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,760
I was playing really well, though.

2460
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:13,580
I will have to admit that I'm enjoying the game now.

2461
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:14,740
Wait, can I?

2462
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,040
No, I want to see my stats.

2463
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,780
How the fuck do I see my stats?

2464
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:20,200
Okay.

2465
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:21,500
I did the most.

2466
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:22,100
Look at that.

2467
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:24,260
I know it's very hard to see.

2468
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:25,520
Oh, there it is.

2469
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:26,220
Look at that.

2470
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:27,780
I fucking carried this team.

2471
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:28,380
Look...

2472
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,340
I think I'm...

2473
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:34,860
I'm playing pretty well.

2474
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:36,380
This world is closing.

2475
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:37,200
Better move soon.

2476
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:39,400
Wait, I had two bots?

2477
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,260
That's not fair.

2478
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,140
I only had one real person.

2479
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,400
That's not fucking...

2480
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,740
My bots did better than my real men.

2481
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,840
That's not fair!

2482
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:52,480
What the fuck?

2483
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:53,900
Why did...

2484
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:57,100
WHY DID MY FUCKING POSTS AT HAND?

2485
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:00,960
That's so sad.

2486
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:06,240
Okay, I'll- okay, I'm gonna try the...

2487
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,040
Wait, uh...

2488
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,780
How do I get to the main menu?

2489
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,400
Jesus Christ.

2490
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:12,620
Uh, okay, there we go.

2491
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:13,920
I'm gonna try finding...

2492
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,440
Uh, that's rough.

2493
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,200
That is so rough.

2494
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:17,480
I'm gonna- I wanna play...

2495
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:19,660
Let's try if I can do, like, what's the 24?

2496
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:21,180
They aren't slow.

2497
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:22,080
That's too many people.

2498
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:23,720
That's so amazing.

2499
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:25,960
Let's see if I can find real players here.

2500
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,610
Oh, I saw the Master Chief collection.

2501
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:40,340
That's too many people.

2502
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:44,900
Like, even in the Battle Royale mode, I was like, there's so many people around me.

2503
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,540
I was- I was like, holy fuck, this fight is never-ending.

2504
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,300
No, those were real.

2505
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:56,680
The- the- when I had that non-stop fight, that- those people were fucking real.

2506
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,700
They were, like, guarding my portal and everything.

2507
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:00,880
A bot would not guard my portal.

2508
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:09,990
I could smell the sweat.

2509
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:11,550
Yeah, no, I fucking could smell it.

2510
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:16,110
And I had to, like- I had to, like, basically shimmy everywhere.

2511
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:22,410
Alright, let's check the arena out one more time.

2512
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:24,850
I'm having fun.

2513
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:27,310
This game- I like how fast the movement is.

2514
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:29,610
I like the gunplay and the movement.

2515
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:32,850
Um, I'm still trying to figure out how to portal.

2516
01:42:33,110 --> 01:42:34,490
I'm- I'm still learning.

2517
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:44,600
Alright, let's go.

2518
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,540
Yeah, it's very fast-paced.

2519
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,700
I like movement shooters.

2520
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:51,800
Movement shooters are always my favorite.

2521
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,680
I just like moving- I like fast-paced games.

2522
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:57,140
I just can't do, like, non-movement stuff.

2523
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,200
Okay, is this zone?

2524
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:09,860
Oh, wait, that's- I was gonna say, like, where am I?

2525
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:26,240
I have too many portals out.

2526
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,920
I don't know where my portals are.

2527
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:30,980
There's too many portals.

2528
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,920
I don't know where I place my portals.

2529
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:41,260
Too many portals.

2530
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:52,820
Where am I?

2531
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:57,300
I still don't know where I am.

2532
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,060
Where's our zone?

2533
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:02,860
Oh, there it is.

2534
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:05,620
Poor guy.

2535
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,960
How do I get down there?

2536
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,040
Wait, they captured it?

2537
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:13,260
I don't even know where the zone is!

2538
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:14,520
Oh, no.

2539
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:21,360
I don't know where- I don't know where the zone is!

2540
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,100
To the zone.

2541
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,080
They're like, zone- I'm just like, where?

2542
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,080
Where is it?

2543
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:25,860
Oh, there it is.

2544
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:27,800
Capture in progress.

2545
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:28,800
Hold your ground.

2546
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:35,040
I found out where the zone is this time.

2547
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:37,540
I figured it out.

2548
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,110
Oh, I see him.

2549
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,720
Get shit on.

2550
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:56,340
Get shit on.

2551
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:56,900
You're capturing.

2552
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:57,900
Try to hold on.

2553
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:02,790
You're capturing.

2554
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:03,770
Try to hold on.

2555
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:06,090
Get shit on.

2556
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:06,130
Get shit on.

2557
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:08,070
Now, time to pull ahead.

2558
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:18,880
Capture underway.

2559
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:19,540
Healer.

2560
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:27,950
No!

2561
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:29,170
I was healing!

2562
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:30,550
Oh, my god.

2563
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:31,130
My teammate got it.

2564
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:31,770
My teammate got it.

2565
01:45:31,850 --> 01:45:32,170
Thank god.

2566
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:34,690
Oh, I have to get the zone again.

2567
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:41,540
Oh, my god.

2568
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,100
That's not fair.

2569
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,480
That's not fair!

2570
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,660
There's three of them!

2571
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:47,100
Oh, yeah.

2572
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,220
You win a 1v3.

2573
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:51,880
You're so good at it.

2574
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,480
You won a 1v3.

2575
01:45:58,620 --> 01:45:59,760
Where's my teammates?

2576
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,100
Where is he?

2577
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:01,700
Oh, nice.

2578
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:02,280
There they are.

2579
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:04,800
Come on, team.

2580
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:08,300
Good teammate.

2581
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:09,080
Good teammate.

2582
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:10,400
We're so...

2583
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,100
Good teammate.

2584
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:15,040
Keep capturing.

2585
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:15,560
Keep capturing.

2586
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,040
You got this.

2587
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:16,440
Yeah!

2588
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:18,280
That's right.

2589
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:21,220
We're better.

2590
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,640
We're fucking better.

2591
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:29,260
Let's go.

2592
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:35,460
Let's fucking go.

2593
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:36,440
Every...

2594
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:37,540
Every one...

2595
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:38,100
Like...

2596
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:38,380
Uh...

2597
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:40,560
Kill Alan got off of me was a 1v3.

2598
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:41,800
I...

2599
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,940
I won an actual 1v1.

2600
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:43,720
Twice.

2601
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:44,720
Two.

2602
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:45,180
Two.

2603
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:45,900
One.

2604
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:47,600
Round two.

2605
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,520
Yeah, his ass can't win a 1v1.

2606
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:50,160
Exactly.

2607
01:47:02,330 --> 01:47:03,250
Where is it?

2608
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:03,650
This way.

2609
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:05,570
Where is the zone?

2610
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:07,430
Oh, it's over here.

2611
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:09,310
Wait.

2612
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:09,950
Where's the zone?

2613
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:11,050
Oh, my God.

2614
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:12,170
How do we get there?

2615
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:14,190
How do you...

2616
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:14,790
Oh, it's...

2617
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:17,170
I'm so confused of, like, areas.

2618
01:47:21,010 --> 01:47:22,050
I was so confused.

2619
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:27,220
Oh, no.

2620
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:32,560
Are you serious?

2621
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:33,880
Killed so many!

2622
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:35,940
Oh, my God.

2623
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,160
Oh,

2624
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:45,320
my God.

2625
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:45,700
Okay, though.

2626
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:46,500
That was a good aim.

2627
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,380
I killed, like, three!

2628
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:48,900
Yeah!

2629
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,680
Let's turn things around.

2630
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:54,720
Okay, I'm grabbing this.

2631
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:55,440
Are you serious?

2632
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:56,380
I'm trying to grab this.

2633
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,420
Oh, what's trying to kill me?

2634
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:01,920
Worth it.

2635
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:06,140
So worth it.

2636
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:07,220
So worth it.

2637
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,500
Watch out.

2638
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:09,800
Enemy is going for a capture.

2639
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:18,900
Oh shit.

2640
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:30,100
Oh shit!

2641
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:31,540
No!

2642
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:33,520
I didn't see him!

2643
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:36,060
I didn't think he would go through the portal!

2644
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:38,900
That was a good play.

2645
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,440
Wait, what?

2646
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:40,280
Who shot me?

2647
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:42,900
Oh my god!

2648
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,240
I didn't think he would go through the portal.

2649
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:47,500
I wasn't expecting that.

2650
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:50,500
This guy's good.

2651
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:57,610
Where's the portal?

2652
01:48:57,710 --> 01:48:58,290
Okay, there it is.

2653
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:03,440
Nice.

2654
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,740
It's 1v1 now.

2655
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,720
Oh my god.

2656
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:11,220
He has good aim.

2657
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,540
He also gets like first shots too.

2658
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:17,580
Which sucks.

2659
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:20,280
He has first shot advantage.

2660
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:22,460
Haha!

2661
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:27,340
Oh fuck!

2662
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:27,880
No!

2663
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:30,730
God damn it, it's okay.

2664
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:31,270
My team's here.

2665
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:32,830
Double kill!

2666
01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:41,510
That guy's really good.

2667
01:49:42,550 --> 01:49:44,030
He's actually really annoying.

2668
01:49:48,590 --> 01:49:49,430
Watch out.

2669
01:49:49,490 --> 01:49:50,750
Enemy is going for a capture.

2670
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:56,120
Okay.

2671
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:03,990
I'm hoping... Oh my god.

2672
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:08,690
I have to be down here for a sec.

2673
01:50:08,690 --> 01:50:09,870
Heating up.

2674
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:10,130
Heating up.

2675
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:10,450
Heating up.

2676
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:12,070
Okay.

2677
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:16,000
Oh no.

2678
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:16,660
Nice!

2679
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:17,040
Nice!

2680
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:17,600
We got it!

2681
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:17,980
Nice!

2682
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:18,600
Yes!

2683
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:20,360
Another round!

2684
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:21,140
Stay shot.

2685
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,900
One round at a time.

2686
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:23,600
Oh.

2687
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,880
Haha, I'm playing so well.

2688
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,040
Oh, that's right.

2689
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:33,220
I win every 1v1.

2690
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:43,430
I just got the aim.

2691
01:50:43,590 --> 01:50:44,270
What can I say?

2692
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:50,970
Oh, he does.

2693
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:58,450
Oh, shit.

2694
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:00,250
Where is it?

2695
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:04,410
Oh, my god.

2696
01:51:07,230 --> 01:51:09,330
Oh, bro, what the fuck?

2697
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:12,010
Why is he... Holy shit, you're so bad!

2698
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:17,270
Oh, my god, he's so bad.

2699
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:51,650
No!

2700
01:51:52,090 --> 01:51:54,510
Oh, my god, I was playing so well.

2701
01:51:55,170 --> 01:51:56,170
Holy shit.

2702
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:57,830
Are you serious?

2703
01:51:57,830 --> 01:52:01,530
Oh, my god, I've played so fucking well, too.

2704
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:05,790
I killed so deep.

2705
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:06,530
Please!

2706
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:09,490
I can't do everything!

2707
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:15,090
Oh, my god, who shot me in the back?

2708
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:16,550
Oh, I got shot in the back.

2709
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:24,510
I was actually playing so fucking well.

2710
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:25,210
It was crazy.

2711
01:52:27,630 --> 01:52:29,210
Oh, my god, I can't.

2712
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:30,190
There's too many people.

2713
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:34,090
I don't think we're gonna get this round.

2714
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:37,690
My team is sandbagging really hard.

2715
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:40,650
Unless, like, I can 1v3 all of this.

2716
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:42,890
I can't.

2717
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:43,890
I can't.

2718
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:45,050
My team needs...

2719
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,490
I need my team to help me.

2720
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:51,290
Oh, my god.

2721
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:52,710
Oh, my god.

2722
01:52:52,710 --> 01:52:53,110
My team.

2723
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:55,370
My team.

2724
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:58,550
I was practically splitting solo.

2725
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:00,550
Oh, my god.

2726
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:02,630
Guys!

2727
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:03,510
Team!

2728
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:06,090
Come on!

2729
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:12,970
My team is sandbagging so hard!

2730
01:53:13,150 --> 01:53:15,110
They have two real players!

2731
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:19,270
I'm literally at, like...

2732
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:21,030
I have 45 kills.

2733
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:28,160
Zone is high.

2734
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,880
Opponent is going for a capture.

2735
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,480
Power weapon inbound.

2736
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:38,440
Okay, I have to, like, be careful.

2737
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:42,960
Alright.

2738
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:49,260
Wait, what?

2739
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:50,120
Oh, my god!

2740
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:50,940
I didn't realize there was...

2741
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:52,300
I didn't realize there was a door there.

2742
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:52,920
That was...

2743
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:53,380
I'm so...

2744
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:54,200
That was my bad.

2745
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,400
I actually played really poorly there.

2746
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:58,480
I didn't know my map there.

2747
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:01,420
I actually got shit on because of it.

2748
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:05,480
Oh, my god.

2749
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:12,290
Oh, my god.

2750
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:16,800
Okay.

2751
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:20,720
Okay.

2752
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:21,740
It's fine.

2753
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:23,260
We got the...

2754
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,060
We got the zone.

2755
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:31,590
Oh, I got two kills.

2756
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:32,110
That's fine.

2757
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:35,390
Okay.

2758
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:36,430
That's fine.

2759
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:37,110
I got the bat.

2760
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:38,070
Zone active.

2761
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:40,830
I think the hard part is that...

2762
01:54:40,830 --> 01:54:41,250
What?

2763
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:42,790
Bro!

2764
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:43,630
What?

2765
01:54:45,410 --> 01:54:46,370
Jesus Christ.

2766
01:54:46,570 --> 01:54:47,090
He's that guy.

2767
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:50,730
Oh, my god.

2768
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:51,430
I got the gold thing.

2769
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:56,810
Okay.

2770
01:55:01,290 --> 01:55:02,250
I can't...

2771
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:02,750
Oh, no.

2772
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:03,670
There's two of them.

2773
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:05,430
I can't do anything about it.

2774
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:07,510
Oh.

2775
01:55:08,450 --> 01:55:09,530
There's two of them.

2776
01:55:12,850 --> 01:55:13,410
Of course.

2777
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:16,270
Of course.

2778
01:55:16,530 --> 01:55:17,810
I backed a 1v2.

2779
01:55:23,670 --> 01:55:24,590
Yeah, that's fine.

2780
01:55:34,690 --> 01:55:35,970
Oh my god, of course.

2781
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:39,230
Of course, I had to slide into another person!

2782
01:55:41,790 --> 01:55:42,670
Oh, fuck.

2783
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:45,770
My team is like struggling so hard, though.

2784
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:48,070
They're actually struggling.

2785
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:49,130
I don't know what to do.

2786
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:00,190
They're struggling right now.

2787
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,140
Oh my god.

2788
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,300
Oh, fuck.

2789
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,820
I tried to guard.

2790
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,480
Oh my god, they're actually like...

2791
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,220
Oh, I don't know who got it.

2792
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:20,500
Yeah.

2793
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:23,540
They're like playing like as a team.

2794
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,700
My team's trickling in one by one.

2795
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:29,420
My team's just trickling in.

2796
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,360
Holy fuck.

2797
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,400
Team, please!

2798
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,960
I'm carrying you all on my back!

2799
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,560
No respawns?!

2800
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,860
Oh, fuck.

2801
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:43,540
Okay.

2802
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,620
I think I'm fucked.

2803
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,620
I think I'm fucked here.

2804
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:50,880
I rely on respawn.

2805
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:02,310
Oh, fuck.

2806
01:57:06,290 --> 01:57:07,390
I need regen.

2807
01:57:08,170 --> 01:57:08,250
No!

2808
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:08,750
No!

2809
01:57:09,490 --> 01:57:10,770
They chased me!

2810
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:12,910
I was the last teammate!

2811
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:15,090
Oh, I knew it!

2812
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:17,550
Oh, my team.

2813
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:19,750
I just think it's my team.

2814
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:21,670
Yeah.

2815
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:24,130
I didn't realize that was the last one.

2816
01:57:24,490 --> 01:57:26,130
It was actually a team diff.

2817
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:30,400
Yeah.

2818
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:34,400
No, they had... My team was struggling so much.

2819
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:36,600
I literally like doubled their damage.

2820
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:40,120
I don't know how they died!

2821
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:41,780
Look at their deaths!

2822
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:52,580
They... I... How did I die last?

2823
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:54,440
Oh, my God.

2824
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:56,880
I was literally flanking, too.

2825
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:04,020
I was literally flanking.

2826
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:09,970
They were even... I don't think they were trying... No!

2827
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:11,330
They were not trying!

2828
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:13,090
There's no way!

2829
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:14,550
Okay, I'll do the last one.

2830
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:15,350
Okay.

2831
01:58:16,370 --> 01:58:20,270
I was playing really well and then like my team kept like...

2832
01:58:20,270 --> 01:58:23,330
My team was actually fucking sandbagging me.

2833
01:58:28,050 --> 01:58:32,110
At one point, I like... I like fucking had like a 1v8.

2834
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:37,130
I had... I had a 1v8!

2835
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:39,430
And my team wasn't there!

2836
01:58:39,590 --> 01:58:41,210
I don't know what happened to them!

2837
01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:47,390
Like... Where was... Where was... I was killing eight people and then like...

2838
01:58:47,390 --> 01:58:49,030
My team just never showed up!

2839
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:51,010
It was... I was so confused!

2840
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:58,100
Sandbagging me!

2841
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:04,380
They just... It's like nobody showed up when I was 1v8!

2842
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,060
Oh, yeah.

2843
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:07,000
Ducks are not in the team.

2844
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:12,480
Oh, yeah.

2845
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:13,800
Yeah, I was so locked in.

2846
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:14,480
Cause like...

2847
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:18,360
They just... They just kept coming and they just kept coming and they just kept coming!

2848
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:19,780
And they just won't stop!

2849
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,220
Like... I was so locked in cause they never stopped coming!

2850
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:27,920
I was so confused!

2851
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:29,460
Don't waste it!

2852
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:30,700
Oh, it's planting?

2853
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:34,280
Between planting the firecracker or defending your base.

2854
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:35,440
What do I plant?

2855
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:37,500
Power

2856
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,020
weapon inbound.

2857
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:45,620
Oh shit.

2858
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:47,960
Oh my god.

2859
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:48,460
I...

2860
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:50,340
I don't... I was like...

2861
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:52,780
I didn't think they were all gonna show up.

2862
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:55,600
How do I plant?

2863
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:57,780
I don't know how to plant.

2864
01:59:58,020 --> 01:59:58,620
I was...

2865
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:09,540
Okay, nice.

2866
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:13,020
Oh, what?

2867
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:16,530
I didn't get the...

2868
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:17,570
Triple kill.

2869
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:18,110
Oh.

2870
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:19,890
Okay.

2871
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:21,930
This is such a weird game mode.

2872
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:23,210
I don't know if I like that game mode.

2873
02:00:23,430 --> 02:00:24,130
It's so weird.

2874
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:25,150
There's a bat.

2875
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:27,170
Ah!

2876
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:48,030
Damn!

2877
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:49,110
Aw, wait!

2878
02:00:49,190 --> 02:00:50,530
They defuse so fast!

2879
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:54,990
I thought we had more time to defuse.

2880
02:00:55,730 --> 02:00:56,610
That's crazy.

2881
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:01,110
Yeah, the defuse was so fast.

2882
02:01:01,230 --> 02:01:02,150
I wasn't expecting it.

2883
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:03,330
I thought we had more time there.

2884
02:01:03,550 --> 02:01:04,430
So I wasn't...

2885
02:01:05,110 --> 02:01:05,950
paying attention.

2886
02:01:06,410 --> 02:01:07,230
At all.

2887
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,380
Oh, I'm a dead here.

2888
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,400
I'm dead here, I think.

2889
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,240
I'm trying to like...

2890
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:32,400
Throw my ball away.

2891
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:38,350
Whoa!

2892
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:41,230
Wait, who...

2893
02:01:41,230 --> 02:01:42,450
Did we plant or they plant?

2894
02:01:42,990 --> 02:01:44,570
I don't like this game mode.

2895
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:45,210
In general.

2896
02:01:47,850 --> 02:01:49,490
This game mode is so confusing.

2897
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:50,390
Not gonna lie.

2898
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:52,930
Like, I'm so confused.

2899
02:01:56,130 --> 02:01:56,710
Defuse?

2900
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:57,250
Again?

2901
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:02,320
Guarding it!

2902
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,620
Firecracker taken.

2903
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:05,740
Okay.

2904
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:08,080
Okay, I'll go guard.

2905
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:08,580
I'll guard.

2906
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:08,880
Fine.

2907
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:10,580
I'll try guarding.

2908
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:14,040
Oh, it's a loop until it works.

2909
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:14,580
Oh!

2910
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:18,320
Okay, I get it.

2911
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:21,160
Okay, I understand now.

2912
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:26,180
I'll try.

2913
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:36,500
Dude, defending it takes so long.

2914
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:42,940
It takes so long to defend.

2915
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:43,920
Double kill!

2916
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:57,340
Okay.

2917
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:58,500
Double kill!

2918
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:00,240
Triple kill!

2919
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:02,640
There we go.

2920
02:03:02,980 --> 02:03:03,640
There we go.

2921
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:04,820
We should win this one.

2922
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:06,460
It's literally two seconds.

2923
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:07,960
There's no way I can defuse this time.

2924
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:09,080
Thank God!

2925
02:03:10,060 --> 02:03:11,540
Yeah, I don't like this one.

2926
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:15,140
This game mode is, like, not great.

2927
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:17,520
I don't like this game mode.

2928
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,700
Uh, bro, this guy...

2929
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,280
This guy's a bot.

2930
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:25,900
I realize what the AI bot profile pictures look like.

2931
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:26,720
It's like this.

2932
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:29,720
This is what they look like.

2933
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:32,780
Yeah, I don't like this game mode.

2934
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:34,360
Five.

2935
02:03:34,780 --> 02:03:35,340
Four.

2936
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:36,300
Three.

2937
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:38,960
I think, like, this game mode is not that fun.

2938
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:40,240
Round two.

2939
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:42,240
We are defense.

2940
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:43,400
Defend our base.

2941
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:44,880
Okay, where's the...

2942
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:51,290
Double kill!

2943
02:03:52,150 --> 02:03:54,630
I sort of understand the portal now.

2944
02:03:54,870 --> 02:03:55,790
Power weapon inbound.

2945
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:57,050
Where's the power weapon?

2946
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:58,270
Fire tracker in the ground.

2947
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:01,110
I want the power weapon.

2948
02:04:01,450 --> 02:04:02,950
Clock is ticking to defuse it.

2949
02:04:03,070 --> 02:04:03,950
Wait, where is it?

2950
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:04,970
Oh, it's down there.

2951
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:06,030
Oh my god.

2952
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:08,190
Okay, it's down there.

2953
02:04:08,290 --> 02:04:09,070
How do I get down there?

2954
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:18,320
Wait, I didn't kill that other guy?

2955
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:19,940
Oh, I thought I did!

2956
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:21,760
He was so low!

2957
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:25,280
I thought I killed him.

2958
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:26,600
I wasn't paying attention.

2959
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:29,040
Oh my god, we gotta help him.

2960
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:29,660
We gotta help him.

2961
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:30,560
Nice, we did.

2962
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:32,660
Yeah, the defuse is so fast.

2963
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:35,780
It's actually so fucking fast.

2964
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:37,120
Look how fast that defuse was.

2965
02:04:45,130 --> 02:04:46,390
I have my turn.

2966
02:04:47,150 --> 02:04:48,190
Oh shit.

2967
02:04:48,610 --> 02:04:49,350
What the fuck?

2968
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:51,910
Not my turn!

2969
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:56,850
Yeah, it's way too fast.

2970
02:04:57,010 --> 02:04:57,830
I think the defuse.

2971
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:07,800
Yeah.

2972
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:10,880
What the fuck?

2973
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:15,090
What the fuck was that?

2974
02:05:17,930 --> 02:05:18,310
No!

2975
02:05:18,470 --> 02:05:19,330
I have to reload!

2976
02:05:19,990 --> 02:05:20,370
Fuck!

2977
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:22,230
I have to reload.

2978
02:05:23,490 --> 02:05:24,250
That sucks.

2979
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:33,980
I have to reload again.

2980
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:34,260
No!

2981
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:35,100
I have to reload again!

2982
02:05:40,030 --> 02:05:41,970
I need to remember I have a sidearm too.

2983
02:05:42,250 --> 02:05:42,590
You're right.

2984
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:43,790
You're right.

2985
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:44,650
I have a sidearm.

2986
02:05:49,390 --> 02:05:50,330
Okay, we have...

2987
02:05:50,330 --> 02:05:50,770
We're...

2988
02:05:50,770 --> 02:05:51,670
We're guarding the plant.

2989
02:05:57,330 --> 02:05:58,190
There you go.

2990
02:06:02,290 --> 02:06:03,130
There has to...

2991
02:06:03,130 --> 02:06:03,890
There's someone here.

2992
02:06:05,150 --> 02:06:05,790
There you go.

2993
02:06:06,570 --> 02:06:08,010
Okay, I know the melee now too.

2994
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:09,470
I need heal.

2995
02:06:10,490 --> 02:06:11,470
But I go back.

2996
02:06:13,410 --> 02:06:13,890
Nice!

2997
02:06:14,290 --> 02:06:14,770
Alright.

2998
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:16,590
I'm getting better though.

2999
02:06:17,150 --> 02:06:18,190
God, I love the movement.

3000
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:20,130
Oh!

3001
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:22,970
I love the movement though.

3002
02:06:23,310 --> 02:06:24,210
The movement's fun.

3003
02:06:26,950 --> 02:06:28,470
The movement's really fun.

3004
02:06:28,970 --> 02:06:29,230
Yeah.

3005
02:06:30,530 --> 02:06:31,690
It's just like...

3006
02:06:31,690 --> 02:06:33,590
I wish you could pick the game mode.

3007
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:34,910
Because I really don't like this one.

3008
02:06:36,910 --> 02:06:39,510
I like the movement and like sometimes the guns.

3009
02:06:39,610 --> 02:06:40,770
Depending on what gun I have.

3010
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:43,610
It's not feeding time.

3011
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:44,630
It's like two hours.

3012
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:45,510
That's the thing.

3013
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:46,370
He like...

3014
02:06:46,370 --> 02:06:46,750
Oh.

3015
02:06:47,650 --> 02:06:48,290
Oh no.

3016
02:06:48,350 --> 02:06:48,910
I don't wanna plant.

3017
02:06:51,510 --> 02:06:53,130
I don't wanna plant.

3018
02:06:55,410 --> 02:06:56,950
But my teammates are dead.

3019
02:07:01,460 --> 02:07:01,600
Okay.

3020
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:02,560
I'm gonna go...

3021
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:10,040
I'll plant here.

3022
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:11,380
I'm gonna plant.

3023
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:13,020
Oh my god.

3024
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:14,760
And it takes fucking forever to plant.

3025
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:16,100
Holy shit.

3026
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:17,960
It takes so long to plant.

3027
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:19,440
Oh my...

3028
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,480
I thought it'd take a lot faster.

3029
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:24,800
But that takes really long time.

3030
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:26,100
That's actually crazy.

3031
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:31,360
Yeah, it's not a fair game mode.

3032
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:32,740
For sure.

3033
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:35,800
Oh, I don't have a port on the other...

3034
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:36,320
God damn it.

3035
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:37,440
I thought I had a port on the other side.

3036
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:41,800
Okay.

3037
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:41,960
Okay.

3038
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:42,720
My team planted.

3039
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:44,740
I don't know if they'll defend it.

3040
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:45,560
Dad, please!

3041
02:07:55,060 --> 02:07:55,640
Oh my god.

3042
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:00,460
Fuck.

3043
02:08:00,620 --> 02:08:01,180
I have to reload.

3044
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:13,260
Oh my god.

3045
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:17,620
I'm gonna look from here.

3046
02:08:24,330 --> 02:08:25,150
Okay, it's five.

3047
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:30,900
That's five.

3048
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:32,400
We got it.

3049
02:08:32,540 --> 02:08:32,740
Yes!

3050
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:34,760
Holy fuck!

3051
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:37,160
Oh my god.

3052
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:38,680
I played out of my mind there.

3053
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:39,800
I played...

3054
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:41,160
I played really well there.

3055
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:41,780
Oh.

3056
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:49,100
No!

3057
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:51,800
No!

3058
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:52,560
No!

3059
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:53,220
No!

3060
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:53,360
No!

3061
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:56,240
No!

3062
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:57,380
He just wants to be fed early.

3063
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:58,440
He wants to be fed like...

3064
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,140
...three hours early!

3065
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,320
Oh my god.

3066
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:03,680
Yeah, he's getting...

3067
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:05,960
He's getting...

3068
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:06,960
He's getting closer now.

3069
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:08,820
But that was fun!

3070
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,820
Okay, I actually enjoyed that.

3071
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:11,800
Like, the more I learned...

3072
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:17,560
The more I learned the game, the more fun I definitely had.

3073
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:23,420
And I definitely really enjoyed the movement part, the movement shooter part.

3074
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:25,020
And like, the gunplay sometimes.

3075
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:26,260
Sometimes the gunplay.

3076
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:28,560
But yeah, the movement's really well.

3077
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:30,700
Portal-wise, I still don't know what I'm doing.

3078
02:09:32,420 --> 02:09:35,580
I think I'm like, slowly learning how to portal.

3079
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:39,560
But like, I feel like I still sort of don't know what I'm doing.

3080
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:41,880
But the movement's pretty solid.

3081
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:42,760
But that was really fun.

3082
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:44,840
Again, Zekra, thank you in the super chat.

3083
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:45,600
Thank you, thank you.

3084
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:48,920
Yeah, I think I was like, my aim was carrying me throughout that, not gonna lie.

3085
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:54,740
I think I won majority of those fights because of my aim.

3086
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:01,140
I think it was definitely like carrying me.

3087
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:03,260
Like, I might not know what I was doing.

3088
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:08,780
But like, as long as I could put my crosshair on a person, like I was making it work.

3089
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:16,300
I don't know if this game should be a battle royale.

3090
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:19,440
No, the battle royale portion of that was so confusing.

3091
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:25,220
But, cause like, the fact that like the portals couldn't close was so bullshit.

3092
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:27,220
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

3093
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:28,220
It closed?

3094
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:32,180
My entire team is like in the other arena.

3095
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:36,360
And the only way to get back is to find another green portal.

3096
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:42,500
But yeah, thank you all for joining.

3097
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:44,140
I would have done a longer stream today.

3098
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:46,340
But I want to do a long stream for the Halo stream.

3099
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:48,020
So I'm gonna call it here, here.

3100
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:49,860
So I can have a little bit of break before we go to Halo.

3101
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:51,960
Hey guys, as always everybody.

3102
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:54,040
Stay hydrated, posture check.

3103
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:55,940
Get a move around to get that blood flowing.

3104
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:57,920
And if you stay up for me, stay up for a little longer.

3105
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,560
Cause I'm starting my first Halo series.

3106
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:01,400
Like, I'm starting my first Halo game.

3107
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:05,700
And starting my first venture into the Halo series.

3108
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:06,900
I've never played Halo before.

3109
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:08,060
A campaign.

3110
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:09,220
I'll say I never played Halo campaign.

3111
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,800
Cause we played Halo Reach, was it?

3112
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:13,280
Multiplayer together.

3113
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:15,680
But I've never played the campaign series.

3114
02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:16,740
Cause I never grew up with Halo.

3115
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:19,000
So I'm starting that for the first time today.

3116
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:20,200
So yeah.

3117
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:23,720
I'll definitely play Splitgate in a member stream with all of you guys.

3118
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:25,540
Maybe do a custom lobby with all of you guys.

3119
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:26,140
Hey guys.

3120
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:27,660
I'll see you guys later, everybody.

3121
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:28,920
Bye, guys.

3122
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:29,920
Bye!
