1
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,120
Everybody!

2
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,440
Hello, hello.

3
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,860
Welcome to Girls Front Line 2.

4
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,080
Exilium.

5
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,220
I hope I'm pronouncing the last part correctly because like dokey things.

6
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,560
But welcome everyone.

7
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,620
Welcome, welcome.

8
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,760
Let me put this up.

9
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:49,180
So, a huge shout out to Sunborn and Mika team for sponsoring me today.

10
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,480
For me to check out Girls Front Line 2.

11
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,020
Exilium.

12
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
This is my first time playing a Girls Front Line game.

13
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,520
I've never played one before.

14
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,800
I heard that what I was told is that it is a sequel, of course, to Girls Front Line.

15
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,320
And it is a 3D strategy RPG game.

16
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,600
And it features like non-photorealistic rendering and physically based rendering technology.

17
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,100
So, like that's like the main thing.

18
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,760
A lot of the main standpoint regarding this game.

19
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,460
The 3D graphics is apparently really, really good.

20
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
And so, I'm super excited to try it out.

21
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:34,280
If you guys want to support this stream, support this sponsor, support me, please feel free to check out the link in the description and pinned in the chat.

22
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,500
You click the link or download the game.

23
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,260
Even clicking the link helps out a lot in general.

24
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,340
So, I've thought the main selling point was the pretty women.

25
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,580
I mean, what makes them look pretty?

26
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,520
The physically based rendering and the non-photorealistic rendering.

27
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,760
That's what makes them pretty, guys.

28
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,620
It's the technology.

29
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:08,480
Anyway, so, they do have a new event right now called Escape from Cyborg, as you see here behind me right now.

30
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,440
So, there is the newest event.

31
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,160
And that's why, apparently, I'm going to be checking out.

32
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,160
There are some new characters.

33
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,620
There is some free stuff that's coming out for this new event.

34
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,640
As you know, like a lot of these games, when there's a new event, that means there's new free stuff.

35
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,840
And we all love free stuff.

36
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,920
So, from what I'm told, basically, we take the role of a commander.

37
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,980
And we're leading the pretty women you see here.

38
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,760
They're called Tactical Dolls, T-Dolls.

39
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,120
And then we're leading them through, like, various missions and stuff like that.

40
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,800
And there's a lot of stuff you could do.

41
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,960
There's apparently a dormitory mode, which I was told was something I should really look forward to.

42
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,200
So, I'm excited about that.

43
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,540
I was telling my friends that, like, oh, yeah, they're like, oh, yeah, what are you going to do?

44
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,980
Do you want to play or anything?

45
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,280
I was like, no, I have to do a sponsor stream later.

46
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,960
And they're like, oh, what is it?

47
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,580
And I was like, oh, Girls Frontline 2, Exilium.

48
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,380
And my friends were like, oh, you're going to enjoy it.

49
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,300
And I was like, why?

50
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,460
Oh, when you get to the refitting room, you'll understand.

51
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,000
I was like, refitting room.

52
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,940
I was like, what do you mean by that?

53
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,180
And then my friends are like, you'll understand.

54
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:47,280
So, I'm looking forward to trying that out.

55
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:57,540
Anyway, apparently, from this event, there are new dolls that you can gotcha.

56
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,240
So, I believe it's Vector, right?

57
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Vector and what's her name?

58
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,640
How do you pronounce it?

59
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,360
Dush Ivanya?

60
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,820
Is that her other...

61
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,600
Yeah, Vector is apparently incredibly OP at the moment.

62
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
Okay, I'm...

63
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,120
I see everybody was like, um, it's actually pronounced this.

64
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm like, what do you mean by that?

65
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,380
Okay, I guess I'll find out.

66
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,660
I'm gonna...

67
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,780
Oh, only Vector is new?

68
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,580
Okay, so there's increased drop rates for both of them.

69
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,920
But Vector is the newest one.

70
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,220
And she is apparently incredibly OP.

71
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,380
So, I look forward to getting her.

72
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,700
Because surely my gotcha luck has improved by then, right?

73
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,900
Go ahead, thank you for the super chat.

74
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,700
Thank you, thank you.

75
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,300
You had to see Doki in the dorm room?

76
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,400
Um, excuse me.

77
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,920
What do you mean by that?

78
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,120
Anyway, uh, thank you for the super chat.

79
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,760
Thank you.

80
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,340
Surely, uh...

81
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,880
Surely, this time, my rates have improved now, right?

82
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,540
Alright, so...

83
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,420
Who knows who don't know?

84
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,840
Like I said, this is like my first time playing this game.

85
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,480
So, obviously, um, I don't know a lot too much about, uh, Girls Frontline 2.

86
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,320
Exilium.

87
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,920
So, I'm learning this game as we go along with the stream.

88
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,480
So, these are all, like, my raw first reactions to everything.

89
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,360
Uh, but other than that...

90
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,720
So, a couple of, like, free stuff that you can get right now for this event is...

91
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,760
There's apparently several new outfits.

92
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,120
So, what is it?

93
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,820
Uh, Colfeen's new outfit.

94
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,540
And Vector's new outfit.

95
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,820
And they are free.

96
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,040
So, uh, as long as you participate in the limit time event...

97
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,480
Uh, you get to, uh, get to get these outfits for free.

98
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,760
Especially for Vector, since she is new.

99
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,860
Um, oh, and her name is Cell...

100
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,640
Cell...

101
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,920
Cell phone.

102
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,120
Oh, like, Colfeen.

103
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,720
I don't know.

104
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,180
That's how I pronounce it.

105
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:47,960
Um, anyway.

106
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,860
And there's also...

107
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,120
If you sign in every day during this event...

108
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,240
Um, there's, like, a bunch of free things you can get.

109
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,580
So, there's Collapse Pieces.

110
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,100
Next Gen.

111
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,700
700 Collapse Pieces.

112
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,880
7... 14.

113
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,400
Next Gen.

114
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,040
Memory Stick.

115
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,020
10.

116
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,380
Transcription Conductor.

117
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,440
20.

118
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,460
Okay, there's a lot of...

119
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,420
You get a lot of transcription conductors.

120
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,180
There's a lot of them.

121
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,600
I can't read Roman numerals.

122
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,880
Uh...

123
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,000
And there is a redeem code, too.

124
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,220
So, you do Labor Day for your redeem code.

125
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,060
Until...

126
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,960
This is for US servers only, by the way.

127
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,460
Um, and it's gonna be from...

128
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,600
Until May 31st.

129
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,580
And, like, the redeem code is Labor Day.

130
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,920
So, you get free stuff.

131
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,160
And you're like, that's not fair.

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,080
I'm not in US...

133
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,960
Just swap to US...

134
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,060
I guess it's time for you to swap to U.S.

135
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,780
servers, guys.

136
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,780
I guess it's time.

137
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,020
Oh, yeah.

138
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,280
So, apparently, it's Golden Week for the other server.

139
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,960
So, what was... which is the other server?

140
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,600
I redeem... so, Labor Day for Dark Winter server.

141
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,000
And then, Golden Week for HowPlay server.

142
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,680
So, there's... use your free codes, guys.

143
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,360
Look at that.

144
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,720
See, you learned something new today.

145
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,520
On my stream.

146
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,940
You learned something new.

147
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:14,660
Anyway, before we do play the game, I do want to react to several of the videos that were sent to me to see, like, you know, what they're about.

148
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,240
So, let me know, SoundGuy, if the video is too loud or not.

149
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,440
So, this is a release trailer and gameplay trailer.

150
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,900
Like I said, I am going in blind.

151
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,720
I saw a lot of people were like, Eee!

152
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,800
Apparently, it's a famous meme.

153
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,680
We're relating to the Girls Front Line community.

154
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,520
It was crazy.

155
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,080
I saw a lot of people were super hyped for me to try it out.

156
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:47,800
There were a lot of, like, people in the community that were super hyped to see me check this game out and to see, like, you know, my reaction to it.

157
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,960
And I'm looking forward to seeing what it's like.

158
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,480
All right.

159
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,480
Let's see what the trailer they sent me.

160
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,100
All right.

161
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,700
Let me know if it sounds okay, guys.

162
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,500
Oh, they're all so cute.

163
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,540
Oh, my God.

164
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,140
And they're holding some big-ass guns.

165
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,000
I love me some...

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,560
V-A-G...

167
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,260
bag.

168
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,020
Oh.

169
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,720
Okay, the 3D graphics is actually really good for 3D.

170
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,240
Oh, fuck.

171
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,220
Eee!

172
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,430
Oh, she's cute.

173
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,150
I like her.

174
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,110
I like her outfit.

175
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,210
Oh, so I...

176
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,170
I know, like I said...

177
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,270
Like, the fact that it's all 3D is really nice.

178
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,070
The rendering, guys!

179
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,150
It's the rendering!

180
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,950
Also, we're playing...

181
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,530
We're gonna be playing...

182
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,190
I'd ask you guys if you guys want to be playing with...

183
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,630
Chinese voice acting or Japanese voice acting.

184
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,910
And we're gonna be playing Japanese voice acting.

185
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,670
Because most people voted for that.

186
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,850
There is no English voice acting for this game.

187
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,790
Yet, I assume.

188
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,570
So it's time to read.

189
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,930
I love reading.

190
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,910
Oh, my God.

191
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,090
Wait, I know her!

192
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,750
Wait, I know this girl!

193
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,250
She's like...

194
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:05,810
It's like...

195
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,490
She's from Girls Front Line 1, right?

196
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,250
That design, the little cross thing?

197
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,110
I've seen that design before.

198
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,470
Yeah?

199
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,050
She's like really famous.

200
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,450
Yeah, 416.

201
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,140
Mostly everyone's from Girls Front Line 1.

202
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,560
Oh!

203
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,480
I know that girl with the blue cross...

204
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,120
Like the blue medic cross.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,260
Because she was like really famous for a while.

206
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,520
Like her design was everywhere.

207
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,580
Oh, my God.

208
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,020
More camera cuts!

209
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,800
Oh, there's a cake.

210
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,280
There's so many girls!

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,140
Which one to choose?

212
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,200
There's so many!

213
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, they're all made...

214
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,140
Using in-game engine?

215
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,740
That's crazy.

216
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,680
They're so pretty.

217
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,740
For in-game.

218
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,800
There's so many girls!

219
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,000
Who will I pick?

220
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,420
I mean, it's easy.

221
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,320
Vector, who I'm definitely gonna get first try.

222
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,240
Oh, there's the...

223
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,960
The gameplay.

224
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:25,520
Oh!

225
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,180
Nice.

226
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,660
Whoa!

227
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,500
Extra...

228
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,560
What the...

229
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,060
Where did she get the...

230
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,880
The ocean?

231
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,340
I'm trying not to swear.

232
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,420
Where did she get the ocean?

233
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,920
Oh, my God.

234
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,980
Swim style.

235
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,020
Like, I love...

236
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,340
I love the beach episode.

237
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,320
Oh, there's the three...

238
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,960
Is this...

239
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,720
Wait a minute.

240
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,000
Is this...

241
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,900
Is this the refitting room?

242
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,040
I understand.

243
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,980
Neurons activated.

244
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,460
I understand now.

245
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,280
Oh, that's just the...

246
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,240
Wait, we're not even at the good part!

247
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,340
Those are just the dorms?

248
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,360
Oh, my...

249
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,260
We're not even at the good part.

250
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,780
Yeah.

251
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,420
Anyway.

252
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh, ho.

253
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,720
Anyway.

254
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,180
All right.

255
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,820
The new doll.

256
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,140
Okay.

257
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,480
So, the next one is...

258
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,000
The trailer for Vector.

259
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,100
Who is the newest character for this game.

260
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,320
And who we're trying to pull for it.

261
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,760
Huh?

262
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,460
That's a free sample.

263
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,280
I see the vision now.

264
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,500
Oh.

265
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,520
Suddenly, I find myself clicking the link to install Girls Frontline, too.

266
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,040
Thank you, Super Chat.

267
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,420
Thank you.

268
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,920
Thank you.

269
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,900
I mean, there's...

270
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,720
The guns are really nice, too.

271
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,620
Like, the...

272
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,940
The guns enthusiasts.

273
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,400
Yeah, I heard the community for this game is, like...

274
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:05,760
Um...

275
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,280
Really strong.

276
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,180
And the, uh...

277
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,440
Some boy in Mika, like, loves to listen to community feedback and stuff.

278
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,500
So, the support for this game is, like...

279
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,040
Um...

280
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,000
I know, like, when I posted in my waiting room, everybody was so excited.

281
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,700
Like, the...

282
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,320
The fan...

283
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,020
The fan interaction for this is really high.

284
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,740
Yeah.

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,060
Yeah.

286
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,000
Guns and anime.

287
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,920
The double whammy.

288
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,640
Oh.

289
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,380
Whoa.

290
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,580
She locked in.

291
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,160
Yeah.

292
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,460
For love of waifus.

293
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:44,940
Oh.

294
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,640
I never thought...

295
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,780
Oh, she uses an SMG.

296
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,300
All right.

297
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,900
So, that's the new character.

298
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,560
That, apparently, everybody wants to get right now.

299
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,220
Because she's incredibly OP.

300
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,620
All right.

301
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,380
I think I can get her.

302
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,700
This time?

303
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,300
For real?

304
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,620
Surely, this time, I can get her.

305
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,480
All right, guys.

306
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,960
So, a huge shout-out to...

307
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,600
Okay, so, like...

308
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,520
Just to be transparent.

309
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,300
A huge shout-out to Sunborn and Mika for...

310
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,500
Providing me an account for this.

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,460
So, like...

312
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,380
There's no way I...

313
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,660
Like, because...

314
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,620
You can tell that I have a lot of resources.

315
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,900
So, there's no way...

316
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,860
I can't mess this up this time.

317
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,220
I...

318
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,660
Surely...

319
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,940
There is no way I can mess this up.

320
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,680
If...

321
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,200
If they gave me some resources to try and pull...

322
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,620
Try and pull her.

323
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,320
I...

324
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,400
I swear to God.

325
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,580
Surely.

326
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,380
All right.

327
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,200
So, I believe, obviously, it should be the recruitment, right?

328
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,200
All right.

329
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,320
So...

330
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,820
I...

331
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,540
I have enough, I think.

332
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,140
I...

333
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,640
I don't know where...

334
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,120
That's only...

335
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,900
There's no way I can't get her in a hundred pulls.

336
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,840
There's no way.

337
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,820
No sound, by the way.

338
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,040
Okay.

339
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,840
How's the sound right now for the game?

340
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,020
There is sound on my end.

341
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:21,940
There is...

342
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
That's enough.

343
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,300
That's up for not.

344
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,140
There's no way I fail the 50-50.

345
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,060
There is...

346
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,720
Okay.

347
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,380
Let me...

348
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,260
It's just because the game might be a little too quiet.

349
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,320
All right.

350
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
I'll boost up the game volume real quick.

351
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,240
All right.

352
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,800
Let me know if it's better.

353
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,140
If not, I can boost it up.

354
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,860
No, it's not muted.

355
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,200
It's playing on my screen.

356
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,080
It's just that it might be a little low.

357
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,420
Yeah.

358
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,720
The game might be a little low.

359
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,340
Okay.

360
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,100
Let me boost it up a little bit more then.

361
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,320
All right.

362
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,840
You hear it now?

363
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,160
That's what it sounds like.

364
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,340
Yeah.

365
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,860
It's very quiet.

366
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,840
All right.

367
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,680
So, if I don't...

368
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:17,220
Also, if you guys want to try your luck, feel free to, as always, like, there is the link to the game in my description and in my chat, pinned in my chat.

369
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,440
So, feel free to check that out, um, to check out the game yourself.

370
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:28,060
And, you know, maybe your luck will be better than mine, but it won't be because I'm going to get her right now.

371
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,000
You know what?

372
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
I have two, right?

373
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,400
I have two extras.

374
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,820
So, like, I might as well do the first two singular polls to prove to you how lucky I am.

375
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
I've never seen the animation yet.

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,440
Surely.

377
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,180
Quote of the century.

378
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,660
Oh, wait.

379
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,920
Oh, that's a blue.

380
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,700
Blue's not...

381
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,260
Oh, it's a gun.

382
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,120
Wait, I can get guns from this?

383
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,040
Okay.

384
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,380
All right, how's the sound, by the way, from the polls?

385
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,560
All right.

386
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,500
Okay, and then I'll do one more just to show you guys that it will be better.

387
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,460
It will be fine.

388
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,020
All right.

389
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,040
Oh, it's okay.

390
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,620
I'm just getting all the bad luck.

391
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,260
Getting all the guns out of the way.

392
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:25,120
Now that I got the guns out of the way, I will get Vector in the first ten polls.

393
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,320
Right here.

394
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:34,040
Now that I got all the guns out of the way, this is where we get the people.

395
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,740
Right here.

396
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,460
That's a purple.

397
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,500
Okay, that's fine.

398
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,160
That's fine.

399
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,900
That's...

400
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
I got the purple out of the way.

401
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,900
I got...

402
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,860
It's okay.

403
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,440
What is she?

404
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,740
Oh?

405
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,580
Oh, she's cute.

406
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,600
Wait, I love her hat.

407
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,740
It's so cute.

408
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,640
Wait, she's so cute.

409
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,220
Wait, I love her design.

410
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,560
Oh, my God.

411
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,940
Okay, I really like her.

412
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,400
I really love her hat.

413
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,740
Because it reminds...

414
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,080
Her hat is really cute.

415
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:18,840
Yeah.

416
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,460
Babushka is her name.

417
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,500
No, babushka.

418
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,760
Wait, she's a grandma?

419
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,320
All right, that's fine.

420
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:29,880
That's fine.

421
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,840
She's cute, though.

422
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,920
I like her.

423
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,660
She's cute.

424
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,940
Also, sound guy.

425
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,500
How was it so far?

426
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,820
All right.

427
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,920
Okay.

428
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:41,860
Wait.

429
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,940
Do you want to consume?

430
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,480
Yes.

431
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,920
I do.

432
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,320
All right.

433
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,920
It's so low.

434
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,760
Okay, I'll boost it up a little bit more.

435
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,820
I still have time to boost it up.

436
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,700
All right.

437
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,140
I can bring up...

438
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,260
All right.

439
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,740
After this, I'll bring it up.

440
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,460
Okay, that's fine.

441
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,460
We're having more time.

442
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,440
It's okay.

443
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,160
We're getting the purples out of the way, guys.

444
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,140
We're just getting the purples out of the way.

445
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,640
More work.

446
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,580
Is it for the character?

447
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,940
Let the greatest genius of the century lend you ahead.

448
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,260
Oh, Tensai.

449
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:19,820
That's me.

450
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,520
Oh.

451
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,200
I don't really like her.

452
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,460
She feels too simple.

453
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,420
I don't know.

454
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,060
I don't know.

455
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,260
I don't really...

456
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,500
Wait.

457
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,040
Is that E?

458
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,940
Oh, I'm sorry.

459
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,440
I love her.

460
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,920
I love her.

461
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,780
Sorry.

462
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,800
I meant to say I love her.

463
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,140
I was just joking.

464
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,120
She's not simple.

465
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,620
I swear.

466
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,080
You take that back.

467
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,000
She's not simple, guys.

468
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,540
Wow.

469
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,940
Look at all the colors she has.

470
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,320
You take that.

471
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:58,940
They're good.

472
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,940
Guys, I love her design, guys.

473
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,380
You do not disrespect.

474
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,920
Guys, I'm...

475
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,680
I am...

476
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,000
Let me get my ukulele out.

477
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,060
I apologize.

478
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,100
I've made an absolutely horrible mistake.

479
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,200
But now I've learned that she is the best girl in the entire game.

480
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,360
Guys, I love her.

481
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,400
Oh, my...

482
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,600
Guys, you know how much I love her?

483
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,760
Guys, I will prove to you how...

484
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,700
Guys, please.

485
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,060
No Google Docs.

486
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,880
I will prove to you guys how much I love her.

487
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,100
Look at that.

488
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,660
Oh, let me...

489
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,220
Let me put her in.

490
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,120
Where is E?

491
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,760
Where is she?

492
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,000
E...

493
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,860
There she is.

494
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,660
Look at that.

495
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,000
Oh, that's much...

496
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,580
You know what?

497
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,280
I love her so much.

498
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,940
You get the level 40 gun.

499
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,040
That's right.

500
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,060
You deserve...

501
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,360
You don't...

502
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,460
Oh, there you go.

503
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,280
You get everything you ever wanted.

504
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,180
Guys, look at that.

505
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,200
Oh, my...

506
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,400
Cheetah, you're the one.

507
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,720
You're the only one for me.

508
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,860
You're...

509
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,020
No way.

510
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,580
Oh, my God.

511
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,320
You know how much I love her?

512
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Okay, we'll save this.

513
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,060
I love her so much that...

514
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,960
How do I...

515
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,540
Guys, I don't know.

516
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,680
Where do I get to, like, level her up?

517
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,480
E to the max.

518
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,980
I don't know how.

519
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,580
What do I click?

520
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,560
Oh, it's over.

521
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,180
Guys, I love her so much.

522
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,800
Where is she?

523
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,880
She's so low.

524
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,840
Guys, don't worry.

525
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,000
I'll do it all for her.

526
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,180
Keep...

527
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,400
Click there.

528
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,880
All right, there you go.

529
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,020
Oh.

530
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,520
Oh, my God.

531
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,560
I raised her maximum level to 30.

532
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,940
Look at that, guys.

533
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,600
Oh, my God.

534
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,860
Look, I can keep going.

535
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,940
Wait, what is V6?

536
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,120
Clue, guy.

537
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,920
Look at that.

538
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,340
See, I told you.

539
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,920
Absolute...

540
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,560
Look at that.

541
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,740
I would never...

542
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,480
I would never, you know, fuck with her.

543
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,240
Fuck with her.

544
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,080
How dare you?

545
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,760
Look, see?

546
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,820
I'll max level her up.

547
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,560
Look at that.

548
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,320
I'll keep going.

549
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,920
Look at that, guys.

550
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,900
Look at that.

551
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,240
And I'll keep going, too.

552
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,080
There you go.

553
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,760
And I'll keep more.

554
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,540
Yeah, you better.

555
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,360
Look.

556
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,320
See?

557
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,080
Oh, look.

558
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,620
I can't do it anymore.

559
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,440
It's just...

560
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,720
Oh, wait.

561
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,400
I could have done this the entire time.

562
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,140
Subject to commander level.

563
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
What does that mean?

564
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,760
Wait, what do I have that everybody is like, what the heck?

565
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,340
Is up here?

566
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,300
Oh, this?

567
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,480
Oh, hey.

568
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,040
Wait, I have her.

569
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,080
Wait, I have her.

570
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,320
Wait, I have multiple skins for her, too, right?

571
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,560
Oh, I do.

572
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,880
I think this one's the better skin, too, right?

573
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,080
Oh, no.

574
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,740
This one was definitely the better skin.

575
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,700
Wait, is she stacked?

576
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,820
Wait, click the...

577
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,860
Where's the icon?

578
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,400
I have to click.

579
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,620
Click this?

580
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,900
What do I do?

581
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:30,900
Hello?

582
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,120
What do I click?

583
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,020
What?

584
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,060
What is she doing?

585
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,140
Oh, shit.

586
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,660
She's showing me her bike.

587
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,840
Oh, that's cool.

588
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,900
What else can I click?

589
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,100
Oh, my God.

590
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,060
Look at the aura farming right there.

591
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,380
Oh, my God.

592
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,080
So badass.

593
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,260
What other stuff can I click, guys?

594
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,180
Is that it?

595
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,040
Why are you clicking her hat?

596
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
What does she do with her hat?

597
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,420
Oh, is she shy?

598
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,600
Oh, she's repositioning her hat.

599
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,400
Look sideways.

600
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:17,940
Why?

601
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,240
Oh.

602
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,660
Vroom, vroom.

603
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,860
Vroom, vroom.

604
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,860
What are you vroom, vrooming about?

605
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,460
Oh, no.

606
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,460
She's a little crazy.

607
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,620
She's like, vroom, vroom.

608
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,320
I'm like, what are you vroom, vrooming about, ma'am?

609
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,180
What's this?

610
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,280
Oh.

611
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,720
A little.

612
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,500
Oh, and then... Oh!

613
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,400
Okay, I can have her in... I feel like the speed... Oh, wait, no.

614
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,080
Her current outfit's a lot prettier.

615
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,020
Alright.

616
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,680
Oh, I can make her pose in different places.

617
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,840
Concentration.

618
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,080
Zoning out.

619
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,420
Deep sleep.

620
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,760
Pondering.

621
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,540
I think I like.

622
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,280
I like overlooking a lot more.

623
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,600
Yeah, that one's really pretty.

624
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,080
And then, what's this?

625
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:18,560
Gift?

626
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,600
No, you don't deserve gifts right now.

627
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,860
Apparently, I have to gift... I should be gifting... An E.

628
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,760
Okay.

629
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,840
I understand now.

630
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,740
I get it.

631
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,220
I get why people want me in the dorm... In the dorm now.

632
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,880
Oh, she does, like, different... She does, like, different stuff.

633
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,320
Okay.

634
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,320
Guys, this is for science reasons.

635
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,940
I... Okay.

636
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,680
I was just curious if...

637
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,020
If there was a different... If there was a different pose or anything.

638
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,400
Wait.

639
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,520
There's, like, a new outfit for her, too.

640
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,840
Okay.

641
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:11,980
Okay.

642
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,660
Can I upgrade...

643
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,260
E?

644
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,580
Is it possible to upgrade her?

645
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,140
Or...

646
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,220
I need to be sure.

647
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,700
Level up?

648
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,900
What am I missing for...

649
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,600
What is the commander level, guys?

650
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,780
What is the...

651
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,180
What is the commander level?

652
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,040
Click her doll?

653
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,540
Lumen...

654
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,380
Lumen's doll?

655
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,980
Oh, she's cute.

656
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,920
I like her.

657
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,020
Which one's Lumen?

658
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,180
Oh, account level?

659
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,440
Oh!

660
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,540
Oh, so my account level isn't high enough for it.

661
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,360
Oh, I see.

662
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,300
Which one's...

663
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,180
Oh, they're all so cute.

664
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,800
Which one's Lumen?

665
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,860
I don't think I have her.

666
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,680
Oh, so I have to be a higher level to be able to level up her.

667
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,980
Oh, okay.

668
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,580
Where is...

669
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,080
Oh, her.

670
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,220
Oh, there she is!

671
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,680
Hello!

672
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,620
Where's the poses you can do?

673
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,600
Oh, I don't...

674
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,940
Oh, I have to make her level 40.

675
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,500
Okay, guys.

676
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,960
How badly do you want me to have her be level 40?

677
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,560
How badly?

678
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,840
We love our babushka.

679
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,400
Oh, I...

680
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,900
How much do you...

681
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,280
Oh, that's so cute.

682
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,980
It's like a little polar bear outfit.

683
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,360
I like her main outfit more, though.

684
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:01,900
Okay, wait.

685
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,700
Let me raise the volume up first.

686
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,260
Uh...

687
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,360
Okay.

688
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,200
Sound.

689
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,580
Voice.

690
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,860
Alright, there you go.

691
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,400
Okay, and then I'll raise up the overall.

692
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,640
Alright.

693
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,640
Let me raise up the overall real quick.

694
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,460
Okay.

695
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,780
Uh...

696
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,180
Okay, we will pull for vector.

697
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,080
This is important!

698
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,780
This is important!

699
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,380
I need to level up our babushka.

700
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,360
Our granny.

701
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,640
I need...

702
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,120
We gotta see what level 40 is.

703
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,200
This is much more important, guys.

704
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,160
Oh!

705
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,740
Oh my gosh.

706
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,760
He uses like a pistol.

707
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,140
Level 40.

708
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:49,780
Granny.

709
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:50,900
Alright.

710
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,900
And then...

711
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,980
Get to level 30.

712
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,400
Alright.

713
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,240
That's right.

714
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,100
Oh, you're so good.

715
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,020
I knew you were perfect.

716
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,100
Alright.

717
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,740
Span.

718
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,500
Okay.

719
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,620
Alright.

720
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,600
Is she level 40 yet?

721
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:08,800
No.

722
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:08,980
Okay.

723
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,360
One more.

724
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,540
Alright.

725
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,500
Now we can see.

726
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,080
Okay.

727
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,380
Alright.

728
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,920
Now we can observe.

729
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,780
Alright.

730
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,200
Let's see what it is.

731
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,580
This is important.

732
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,040
Oh, it's not that...

733
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,220
It's not that special.

734
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,560
Okay.

735
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,040
You guys made it look like it was gonna be very special.

736
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,620
Yeah.

737
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,220
I'm a little...

738
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,060
You know, all I'm gonna say is that I expected more.

739
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:39,980
I...

740
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,320
Move the cap.

741
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,040
You don't understand, Toki.

742
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,040
You gotta move the ca...

743
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,240
Okay.

744
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,460
How do I move the camera?

745
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,160
Yeah.

746
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,140
How do I...

747
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,900
Alright, guys.

748
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,900
How do you move...

749
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,040
Okay.

750
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,680
There it is.

751
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,300
How is that more...

752
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,140
How?

753
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,320
How is that...

754
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,780
Top right.

755
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,140
Okay.

756
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,400
I don't understand.

757
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,540
How is that...

758
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,600
I guess you wanna like...

759
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,180
Okay.

760
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,100
Now I understand.

761
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,200
You can zoom in.

762
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:14,900
Okay.

763
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,040
Now I understand.

764
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,040
I...

765
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,980
Now the fact that I can zoom in...

766
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,920
I understand.

767
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,560
Okay.

768
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,280
Oh, shit.

769
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:28,680
Okay.

770
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,440
Sorry.

771
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,020
I couldn't control it properly.

772
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:31,800
Alright.

773
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,420
Alright.

774
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,420
From below!

775
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,960
What do you mean?

776
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,480
What do you mean?

777
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,380
From below!

778
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,380
Alright.

779
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:39,660
Wait.

780
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,520
I wanna see...

781
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,180
Wait.

782
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,100
What is it?

783
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,780
Okay.

784
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,520
But I wanna see like...

785
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,220
Okay.

786
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,180
Okay.

787
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,660
Guys.

788
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,920
I can't.

789
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,360
Wait.

790
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,760
She's wearing pants though, right?

791
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,460
She's wearing pants.

792
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:01,740
Okay.

793
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,260
That's good.

794
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,720
Okay.

795
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
I can't.

796
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,920
I can't.

797
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,100
I can't.

798
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,960
I gotta go in a corner.

799
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,700
I can't.

800
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,220
Guys.

801
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,520
I can't.

802
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,140
I can't.

803
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,940
I can't.

804
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,520
I can't.

805
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,120
I can't do that.

806
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,700
I can't.

807
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,900
I can't.

808
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,540
Oh.

809
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,200
If you wanna do it, you can tell.

810
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,560
I gotta go in a corner.

811
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,900
I don't feel so good.

812
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,620
I need to go in the corner.

813
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,860
I'll observe in a distance.

814
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
In a safer spot.

815
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,580
I'll observe over here.

816
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,880
Okay.

817
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,440
Don't spy on the granny.

818
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:45,940
Alright.

819
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,520
I understand now.

820
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,240
Okay, so basically, it's like...

821
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,360
What?

822
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,340
I gotta go back in my corner.

823
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:10,400
I can't... I gotta go back.

824
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,860
Hello, beautiful.

825
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,640
Hello, beautiful.

826
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,340
You look beautiful today.

827
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,160
We're not going on the back.

828
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,200
We're good.

829
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,040
Her face is up here.

830
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,160
Guys, her face is here.

831
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,700
Right here.

832
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:33,540
If you guys want to see for yourself, you don't... Shit.

833
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,040
Okay, there we go.

834
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,260
There we go.

835
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,500
The perfect sensor.

836
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,260
Right here.

837
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,080
There we go.

838
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:53,420
You can do... You can... Click the link in the description and pin... Pin the... In my chat.

839
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,720
To have your own POV.

840
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,800
Alright.

841
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,660
I can't.

842
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,180
I can't.

843
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,940
I feel like I need to go in the shame corner.

844
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,300
After that.

845
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,320
I can't.

846
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Yeah.

847
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,200
But her feet are... Because thank you for the magenta super.

848
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:13,800
Thank you.

849
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,140
I have to go in the shame corner.

850
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,880
For even... Looking.

851
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,280
For even... Oh.

852
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,160
Oh.

853
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:21,500
Oh.

854
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,980
I understand now.

855
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,320
I... Next thing.

856
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,780
Thank you for the super chat.

857
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,440
Thank you.

858
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,620
Alright.

859
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,380
What color were her eyes?

860
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,500
They were beautiful.

861
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,750
Green.

862
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,480
Alright.

863
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,040
Alright.

864
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,780
We pulled for Vector.

865
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,020
Guys, we're here for Vector.

866
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,840
Remember...

867
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,620
We're here... We're here for Vector chat.

868
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:51,420
That... Guys, have we forgotten our main mission here was for Vector, guys.

869
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,680
For...

870
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,240
For Vector, everybody.

871
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,380
We're always here for Vector.

872
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,480
Alright.

873
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,300
This is it.

874
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:02,940
Yippee!

875
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,440
Oh, it was just for a gun.

876
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,200
That's cool.

877
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:08,660
Alright.

878
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,200
I didn't realize I skipped.

879
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,900
Okay, that's fine.

880
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,840
We're still...

881
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,980
We still... We can still get it.

882
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,300
Alright.

883
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,120
Alright.

884
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,160
Alright.

885
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,860
Here we go.

886
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,360
It's okay.

887
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,220
We're getting out.

888
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,700
You know what?

889
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,740
I'm happy that we didn't get Vector yet.

890
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,320
I'm a little... I might be a little flustered right now.

891
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,760
I'm happy that we're not getting Vector yet.

892
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,240
I need time.

893
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,000
I need time.

894
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,380
I need time.

895
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,960
Oh, I already have her.

896
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,500
I mean, she's cool.

897
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,360
Her intro is cool.

898
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,780
I'm re-downloading for Vector.

899
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:52,920
Alright.

900
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,640
Her intro is cool.

901
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,580
Why is she using a melee weapon in a gun game?

902
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,100
Alright.

903
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,780
Not what we wanted, but that's... I... It's okay.

904
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,220
I'm okay with waiting a little.

905
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,040
I'm okay with waiting a little.

906
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,920
Oh, yeah.

907
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,440
I'm okay.

908
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm okay, guys.

909
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,220
Oh.

910
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,420
Now I understand why my friends were like, you'll see...

911
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,440
when you get to the refitting...

912
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,760
when you get to the dorm.

913
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,200
Alright.

914
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,920
Hmm.

915
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,160
Oh, is it just a gun?

916
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,480
Oh, it's just all guns.

917
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,080
Alright.

918
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,100
Still nothing.

919
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,340
It's okay.

920
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,320
We're just...

921
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,080
It's just building tension, as always.

922
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,700
We're just building tension, guys.

923
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,560
This is where we're actually getting her.

924
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,550
This is the golden light.

925
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:44,530
Right here.

926
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:45,950
Right now.

927
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:46,510
Okay.

928
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,570
Maybe not now.

929
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,230
Maybe...

930
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,470
It's for the content.

931
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,970
We're building tension.

932
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,970
We're building excitement.

933
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:54,950
We're building...

934
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,070
We're building it up.

935
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,860
Greetings from welcome...

936
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,600
No, no, no, no.

937
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,100
There's no hard pity here.

938
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,320
There's no...

939
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,260
There's no hard pity.

940
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,280
My luck is not that bad, guys.

941
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,410
What do we spy?

942
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,190
I respectfully looked at Granny.

943
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:19,990
Oh!

944
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,090
Okay, look at that.

945
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:22,630
See?

946
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,050
Even the game agrees with me.

947
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,290
That it was very respectful.

948
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,730
This is it.

949
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,750
That's how we mean again.

950
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,930
I'm a little happy, I guess.

951
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,050
Is that Vector?

952
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,350
Did I get her?

953
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,010
Oh my god, I got her!

954
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:45,910
I told you!

955
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,930
I told you!

956
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,810
My luck was not that bad!

957
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,250
Oh my god.

958
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,030
Does she have to use her feet, though?

959
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,130
Did she...

960
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,530
Did she...

961
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:56,830
She's...

962
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,050
Oh, and I get a bonus, too!

963
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,950
Is she...

964
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,990
Yes, she does.

965
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,670
Yes.

966
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,630
She had to.

967
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,790
Oh, she's cute!

968
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,150
Oh, she's cute!

969
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,870
Oh, she's here for the money!

970
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,670
I got the 50-50!

971
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,670
Let's go!

972
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,470
Wait, another one?

973
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,990
Oh,

974
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,420
she's like a ninja!

975
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,980
Another purple!

976
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,980
Oh, she's like a sniper!

977
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,120
Oh, nemesis!

978
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,380
Single target damage!

979
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:44,920
Ooh!

980
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,880
Nice!

981
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,920
I got it!

982
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,940
I told you, guys!

983
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,620
I told you!

984
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,800
My luck is not that bad anymore!

985
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,500
I'm reformed now!

986
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,440
This is where everything goes up for Doki!

987
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,200
Alright!

988
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,420
Anyway, since we're here...

989
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,380
Alright, we gotta...

990
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,360
Where is she?

991
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,620
Where's Vector?

992
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,300
Now that Vector is here...

993
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,120
You know what that means, guys!

994
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,500
Wait, what outfits does she have right now?

995
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,620
It's the free one, right?

996
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,340
Oh, Molotov Bunny!

997
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,500
I believe this is the free outfit...

998
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,860
That you can get from the event!

999
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,440
Okay, bring up the overall, no problem!

1000
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,640
Okay...

1001
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,580
And then...

1002
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:28,840
Oh!

1003
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,360
Wait, turn to the front!

1004
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,100
I wanna see!

1005
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,740
Oh!

1006
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,360
It's like a...

1007
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,560
A schoolgirl outfit!

1008
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,840
Yeah, this...

1009
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,900
The bunny is free!

1010
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,180
We gotta complete the event!

1011
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,060
Yeah, from the achievement system!

1012
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,200
I know there's like a couple of free...

1013
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,240
Free stuff you can get!

1014
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,320
Uh...

1015
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,760
Alright, let's give her...

1016
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,940
It's time to level her up!

1017
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,160
Alright, level 20!

1018
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:56,900
Oh!

1019
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,160
Oh!

1020
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,920
Oh, she's like a...

1021
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,580
You tell person!

1022
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,200
Boo!

1023
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,160
Sorry!

1024
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
You tell us for weak!

1025
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,520
It's for the weak!

1026
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,880
Yo!

1027
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,420
That's sick!

1028
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,840
And she kicks the grenades, too!

1029
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,560
I heard she's really strong, too!

1030
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,440
Yeah, every doll has a different animation!

1031
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,420
You're making enemies today!

1032
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm joking, guys!

1033
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,880
I'm joking!

1034
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,040
I love you, too!

1035
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,780
Yeah, it seems like her AoE is pretty crazy!

1036
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,880
Make her unique weapons and make her powerful?

1037
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,760
Okay...

1038
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,900
Alright, I got to level 40...

1039
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,520
Let me get to level 40 first, guys!

1040
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,220
Oh...

1041
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,400
Oh...

1042
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,540
Alright...

1043
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,880
Okay, we're level 40.

1044
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,720
That's the main reason we're here.

1045
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,920
Alright, now that we're level 40...

1046
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,020
Oh, do I have her main gun?

1047
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,780
Change...

1048
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,440
I don't, right?

1049
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,340
What's her main gun?

1050
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,320
I have so many guns, guys!

1051
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,360
I don't know...

1052
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,060
No?

1053
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,260
Oh, I don't.

1054
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,380
Okay, I have the...

1055
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,020
I have the pull for it.

1056
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,340
Okay.

1057
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,120
Okay, but that's not the important part right now.

1058
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,300
Oh, she does painting!

1059
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,240
Oh, that's cute!

1060
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,060
What does she do for entertainment?

1061
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,200
I just have to be sure.

1062
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,080
Sorry.

1063
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,000
I...

1064
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,800
Deep sleep.

1065
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,450
Okay.

1066
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,790
I just have to be sure...

1067
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:49,810
I'm reading.

1068
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,290
Jesus.

1069
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,820
Okay, I mean...

1070
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,800
This is like pretty...

1071
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,920
It's pretty casual.

1072
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,640
It's...

1073
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,760
It's pretty casual, guys.

1074
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,780
See, nothing wrong here.

1075
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,960
Oh, the painting!

1076
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,340
Oh, yeah!

1077
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,280
I should check the painting!

1078
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,060
What?

1079
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,720
What are you talking about?

1080
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,200
I'm just checking what she was doing!

1081
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,280
I just wanted to know!

1082
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,040
That's not creepy at all.

1083
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,060
That's...

1084
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,580
Oh, yeah!

1085
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,320
What is she painting?

1086
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:27,900
You're right.

1087
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,980
What was she painting?

1088
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,120
Let's see...

1089
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:32,920
Oh...

1090
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,660
Oh, my God!

1091
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,900
Okay, she might have some issues.

1092
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,980
She might be a pyromaniac.

1093
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,760
Look, see?

1094
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,540
This is very innocent, guys.

1095
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,100
Yeah, this is...

1096
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,880
A very innocent time here we're having.

1097
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:51,860
All right.

1098
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,100
You see, look.

1099
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,980
What's she reading?

1100
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,520
What are you reading, Hector?

1101
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,880
What are you reading?

1102
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,660
I will never know...

1103
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,800
Look, I just wanna know what she's reading, guys!

1104
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,180
I just...

1105
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,700
Just...

1106
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,960
I just...

1107
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,540
I just...

1108
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,280
Let me...

1109
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:21,480
Let...

1110
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:21,900
I...

1111
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,140
I don't know.

1112
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:26,880
Okay.

1113
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,140
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1114
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,940
Ah, ah, fuck.

1115
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,500
Okay.

1116
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,740
I can't, I need to be in a corner.

1117
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,000
I need to be a dog for my sins.

1118
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,240
I need to be...

1119
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,380
I'm okay.

1120
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,660
I'm okay.

1121
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:53,720
I'm okay.

1122
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,900
Alright, let's see if we can pull for...

1123
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,620
Let's see if we can pull for a gun, guys.

1124
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:00,920
Um...

1125
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,840
Guys, we're here for a gun.

1126
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,120
We're here for a gun.

1127
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,540
Maybe we can get our gun, guys.

1128
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:12,980
Yay!

1129
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,080
Yay!

1130
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,340
Wait, is the gun gold or purple?

1131
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,460
Oh, it's the wrong batter?

1132
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,860
Oh, whoops.

1133
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,620
I...

1134
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,000
It's okay.

1135
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,540
I wanted that other gun anyway.

1136
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:31,960
Oh, it...

1137
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,400
Oh, it's this!

1138
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,540
Oh, and there's her.

1139
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,900
There's the other girl.

1140
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,520
Is it this?

1141
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,720
You are forgiven.

1142
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,320
It's okay.

1143
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,680
I got a cooler gun.

1144
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,860
Standard procedure?

1145
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:50,320
Okay.

1146
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,380
It's this.

1147
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:51,720
Alright.

1148
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,000
Let's do it.

1149
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:53,520
I have enough.

1150
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,180
I can pull for it.

1151
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,150
It should be fine.

1152
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,710
It should be...

1153
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,270
You are forgiven.

1154
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,050
Oops.

1155
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,210
Guys, I don't...

1156
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:11,350
Wait!

1157
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:11,730
Wait!

1158
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:12,290
What was that?

1159
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,890
Wait, I can still look at it from here.

1160
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,910
I forgot they're all guns.

1161
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:17,870
So I'm just like...

1162
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,230
Accidentally skipping them.

1163
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:20,910
Wait, what's this?

1164
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,650
Oh, it's just a normal gun.

1165
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,330
Oh, it's just her purple?

1166
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:28,490
Oh, is that...

1167
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:28,950
I got it?

1168
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,490
Oh, I got the purple version of it.

1169
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,070
Well, that means I can try another one.

1170
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:35,930
Okay.

1171
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,030
I'll just skip it.

1172
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,470
What's that?

1173
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,770
Oh, I did it!

1174
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,010
Yeah!

1175
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,850
I did it!

1176
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:52,950
Yeah!

1177
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,950
I'm so confused.

1178
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:56,730
I was like...

1179
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,810
Why is it rotating?

1180
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,370
Why is it...

1181
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,530
Oh, that's that easy.

1182
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:02,010
Look at that.

1183
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:02,830
I told you guys.

1184
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,090
My luck...

1185
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,310
Is back, baby!

1186
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,470
My luck is back!

1187
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,530
Let's go!

1188
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:12,170
I knew it!

1189
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,870
This is all it took, guys.

1190
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,150
You want some of my...

1191
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:16,770
Wait, where is she?

1192
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:17,350
Where's Vector?

1193
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,870
You want some of my luck?

1194
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,130
Just use my link in the description and pin in my chat.

1195
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,810
And experience how lucky you can be.

1196
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,470
Alright, let's change my gun.

1197
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,910
That's her gun, right?

1198
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:28,610
Change.

1199
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:29,890
This is...

1200
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,130
Oh, I can like change her...

1201
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,670
Her stuff for it, too.

1202
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:34,490
Skin appearance.

1203
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:36,810
Enable...

1204
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,190
Oh, wait.

1205
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:37,530
Oh!

1206
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:38,670
Like how...

1207
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,070
Different attachments and stuff.

1208
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,330
Actually, I like the current one.

1209
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,390
If I lose a 50-50...

1210
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,670
No blame on others.

1211
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,170
If you lose a 50-50, it's because you accidentally took another streamer's luck.

1212
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:53,050
Not mine.

1213
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,250
Yeah, you can mod the weapons, too.

1214
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:57,650
Oh.

1215
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,670
Does she have like different...

1216
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:00,490
Poses?

1217
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:02,830
Just like...

1218
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,530
Oh, there it is!

1219
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:04,410
Oh!

1220
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:06,910
That's so cool!

1221
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,670
I like the little animations that you do, too.

1222
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:12,150
Okay.

1223
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:14,330
It's maxed level.

1224
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:15,350
Is everything maxed?

1225
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:15,750
Oh, no.

1226
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:16,930
I can max her up.

1227
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,210
Fortification?

1228
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:21,510
Oh, I don't have...

1229
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,510
I don't have her stuff.

1230
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,170
Zoom in on her face?

1231
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:25,750
What?

1232
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:28,570
Aww!

1233
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:32,270
It's like...

1234
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,030
Oh, I love her eyes.

1235
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:35,230
The fact that this is all...

1236
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:35,930
Oh, my God.

1237
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,070
I love that this is all 3D.

1238
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,610
The fact that this is all 3D is really impressive.

1239
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,240
I love the 3D rendering.

1240
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,160
It's like...

1241
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,240
It's like...

1242
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,740
Look at the detail on her fucking jacket.

1243
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:55,120
Sorry.

1244
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,020
Freaking jacket!

1245
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,340
Oh, my God.

1246
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,120
Like the details and everything.

1247
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,320
The models are so good.

1248
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,260
I actually really like the models in general.

1249
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,020
Yeah.

1250
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,660
I heard there's also like...

1251
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:07,660
Uh...

1252
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,900
There's the...

1253
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,100
What was it called?

1254
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,020
The gun room?

1255
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,680
Where's the gun room, guys?

1256
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,100
I wanna see the gun room.

1257
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,540
Yeah, the details are really impressive.

1258
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,040
But thank you again for the sponsor.

1259
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,440
Public area?

1260
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,300
Oh, there it is!

1261
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,120
The weapon gallery!

1262
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,760
So you get like...

1263
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,340
Quick play.

1264
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,680
So you can place your guns and everything and like...

1265
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,960
Yeah, place your favorite...

1266
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,740
Okay, there should be a katana there though.

1267
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,500
And then...

1268
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,640
So then you have your own little weapon storage here and everything.

1269
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,980
Like all the gun nuts out here can like...

1270
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,680
Customize what kind of guns they want to be put up top.

1271
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,120
And everything.

1272
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,060
Oh my god, I have some strong ass guns.

1273
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,500
Uh...

1274
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,800
My cool ass swords.

1275
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,920
Wait, that's just a sword.

1276
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,780
Wait, that's not katana.

1277
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,940
Yeah, that's just a regular sword.

1278
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,820
Oh, and then...

1279
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,700
What's the dispatch room?

1280
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,780
This is my...

1281
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,000
Claim hall.

1282
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:14,600
Yay!

1283
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,640
That's right.

1284
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,500
Go get your stuff.

1285
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,080
Alright.

1286
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,120
My...

1287
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,600
Oh, then this is where like the true content is.

1288
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,720
Alright, let's check out the new event.

1289
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,040
I wanna look at the new event.

1290
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,140
Uh...

1291
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,440
Escape from cyborg.

1292
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,520
Challenge.

1293
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:39,740
Supply.

1294
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:40,620
Story.

1295
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,840
Lot of play.

1296
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,540
Which one do I click?

1297
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,720
Oh, reset my troops.

1298
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,240
You're right.

1299
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,700
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1300
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,720
It doesn't matter, guys.

1301
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:53,900
Sorry?

1302
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:55,980
This one?

1303
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,540
Alright, let's check out the gameplay.

1304
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,270
I wanna see what the gameplay is like.

1305
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,950
Oh yeah, but is it sound a lot better now?

1306
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,490
Sorry, the side quest.

1307
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,130
Let's check out the mini game.

1308
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,250
The mini game.

1309
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,130
Oh.

1310
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:29,770
Okay.

1311
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,550
Um...

1312
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:31,750
Obviously I want...

1313
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,310
I want her in here.

1314
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:35,970
How do I unselect?

1315
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,890
No, I don't want you.

1316
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:38,830
Withdraw.

1317
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,490
I want you.

1318
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,850
And then I want vector.

1319
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,090
There we go.

1320
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:45,170
Oh.

1321
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,950
This might be a really bad line-up.

1322
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,110
Guys, is this line-up bad?

1323
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,990
Put vector and E are in here!

1324
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,730
No way.

1325
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,190
Their OP is fine.

1326
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:08,930
Okay, that's good.

1327
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:11,270
Alright.

1328
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,170
Um...

1329
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:17,470
Go.

1330
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And action.

1331
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,460
Oh, this is a strategy RPG.

1332
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,020
Killer.

1333
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:26,940
Yeah.

1334
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,880
Oh, I can kill him from here?

1335
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,120
Oh my god, I'm so strong.

1336
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,460
Kill him.

1337
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,420
Okay.

1338
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,760
You know I can't.

1339
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,480
I want you to kill him.

1340
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,090
Can I kill him?

1341
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:47,650
Can I?

1342
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,830
Oh, use auto?

1343
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:50,990
No, I can figure...

1344
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:52,390
Guys, I can figure this out.

1345
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:54,830
And then...

1346
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:55,290
Okay.

1347
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,750
Oh, the third skill.

1348
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:58,190
This one?

1349
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:00,310
Oh!

1350
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:00,770
Okay.

1351
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:02,410
Kill him!

1352
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,390
Oh, yes!

1353
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:03,970
They're all dead!

1354
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:08,270
Alright.

1355
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,770
Oh my god.

1356
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,470
Sue me.

1357
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:11,490
Okay.

1358
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:12,290
Alright.

1359
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:13,270
You go out in the open.

1360
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:14,130
It'll be fine.

1361
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,450
You'll be so healthy.

1362
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,530
What's the worst that could happen?

1363
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:22,630
Oh.

1364
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,510
You could get shot.

1365
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,070
It's okay.

1366
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,050
Stand in the open, Sue me!

1367
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:26,970
You'll be fine!

1368
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:27,370
You'll be fine!

1369
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,530
Like, that did nothing to you!

1370
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:30,450
You're so healthy!

1371
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:32,450
Scale four?

1372
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,590
What's it do?

1373
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:41,070
Select one empty dealing equal to all enemy targets within three tiles.

1374
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:41,790
Oh, okay.

1375
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:41,870
Okay.

1376
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:43,810
Yeah.

1377
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,320
There we go.

1378
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,550
Oh my god.

1379
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:54,670
That's right.

1380
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,050
Goodbye.

1381
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:59,450
Oh, it's a freeze-down.

1382
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:00,050
Yeah, it's okay.

1383
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,230
Her swimsuit is...

1384
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,990
Oh, I'm gonna use ults for everything.

1385
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:04,610
It's fine.

1386
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:05,510
It's only level one.

1387
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:06,010
It's fine.

1388
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,010
Yay!

1389
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:09,790
Candy!

1390
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,710
Let's just use ults for...

1391
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:14,770
Use ults for everything!

1392
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,530
Yay!

1393
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,210
Yay!

1394
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:24,690
Yippie!

1395
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,780
Huh?

1396
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:34,070
Oh.

1397
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:36,450
Uh...

1398
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:37,310
Ult time!

1399
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,420
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1400
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,000
I think she...

1401
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,540
Never mind.

1402
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,160
Never mind.

1403
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,340
Let me just walk over.

1404
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,280
Yeah, let's just walk over.

1405
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:49,800
Get closer.

1406
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,320
Why are you running?

1407
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:56,600
Oh, wait.

1408
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,980
I was supposed to save them.

1409
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:58,620
Oops.

1410
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,820
Oops.

1411
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,300
Okay.

1412
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,460
Let me head over there and save them real quick.

1413
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,300
I forgot my entire objective.

1414
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,200
Oh, yeah.

1415
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,620
We needed help.

1416
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,000
Okay.

1417
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,600
There we go.

1418
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:20,840
Ult!

1419
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,320
Vroom!

1420
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,160
There we go.

1421
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,300
I did it.

1422
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,280
It's not overkill.

1423
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,480
It's okay.

1424
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,300
It's not overkill.

1425
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:36,960
What's this?

1426
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,600
Immune to all?

1427
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:38,960
Negative?

1428
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,100
Oh, I don't need that yet.

1429
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,920
Can you shoot yet?

1430
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:43,620
No?

1431
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,140
Okay.

1432
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,740
Alright, you should head over and help out the team.

1433
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:52,830
You know what?

1434
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:53,410
Get closer.

1435
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:57,640
Alright.

1436
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,520
It's fine.

1437
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,380
Nothing's gonna hurt you.

1438
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,220
You'll be fine.

1439
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:01,860
Don't worry.

1440
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,740
They don't need to shoot.

1441
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,920
We're giving them a chance.

1442
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,980
What are they gonna do?

1443
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,580
Kill me?

1444
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,560
I'm level 40.

1445
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,840
Just kill them.

1446
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,400
Pew, pew, pew.

1447
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah, I can do it again too.

1448
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,020
Oh, I cannot do it again.

1449
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,300
What?

1450
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,240
What?

1451
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:29,280
What?

1452
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:29,780
Guess I'm learning.

1453
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,260
Wait, what's this?

1454
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,000
Oh, okay.

1455
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:34,740
We don't care.

1456
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,160
Only...

1457
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,420
Okay.

1458
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
I can read.

1459
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,940
Actually, no.

1460
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,140
You're so far away.

1461
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,560
Okay.

1462
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,760
And then I'll use...

1463
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,720
Winter's Wrath.

1464
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,780
Able to be climbed.

1465
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,640
What do I do here?

1466
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,400
Moving six tiles to do...

1467
00:56:59,400 --> 00:56:59,640
Oh!

1468
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,920
I don't have enough tiles.

1469
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,600
Get over there!

1470
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:08,580
Move!

1471
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,860
Wait, if I go here...

1472
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,220
Oh!

1473
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,140
And then I can see them!

1474
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:15,500
Nice!

1475
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,620
Okay, I figured it out.

1476
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,000
Alright.

1477
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,940
Pew, pew, pew!

1478
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:21,960
I did it!

1479
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:22,780
Alright.

1480
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,600
Guys, I'm slowly figuring it out.

1481
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,460
I'm a great strategist.

1482
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,660
Oh, it's so far.

1483
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,520
Why aren't you closer?

1484
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,580
Why aren't you closer?

1485
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,020
Why can't you be closer?

1486
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,680
It's fine.

1487
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,300
We'll end turn.

1488
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,240
We're too far.

1489
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,480
Don't worry.

1490
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,700
I'll just be here...

1491
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,720
and give you comfort.

1492
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,220
I'll just show...

1493
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,560
I'll be here next to them...

1494
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,660
just for comfort wise.

1495
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,740
You go E with them.

1496
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,240
Look!

1497
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,040
I healed them!

1498
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,660
What are they gonna do?

1499
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,240
Shoot me?

1500
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,440
Oh.

1501
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,680
Look at that.

1502
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,900
It did five...

1503
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,800
It did like one damage on me.

1504
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,580
Alright.

1505
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,000
This isn't overkill at all.

1506
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:15,740
Yay!

1507
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,520
We did it!

1508
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,800
I told you guys I could do it.

1509
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,540
I'm worried about the loosening of the agreement.

1510
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,400
Naturally reaches members of Combat Team B.

1511
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,640
They're like little ants.

1512
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:46,840
With Klukai's permission, 404 Combat Team B being led by Vector also successfully rendezvous with the Elmo.

1513
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,560
And just like that...

1514
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,300
Having...

1515
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:52,700
Whoops!

1516
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,780
I actually clicked it.

1517
00:58:54,060 --> 00:59:00,060
Having just completed some combat simulation training, the members of Combat Team B returned to the terminal.

1518
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,280
The progress bar on the monitor is at 100%.

1519
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,800
And dense rows of data and statistical charts start scrolling down.

1520
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,740
Vector stares at the final combat evaluation score with a slight frown.

1521
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,300
Why are you angry?

1522
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,340
You don't look very happy despite the decent score.

1523
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,760
Why aren't you happy?

1524
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,960
Candidness is a key to effective communication among teammates.

1525
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,620
So tell me, why are you dissatisfied with the score?

1526
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,880
It's not about the score.

1527
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:39,470
Well Rod, you didn't follow the operation plan we agreed upon beforehand.

1528
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:45,770
A good plan should be flexible enough to withstand change.

1529
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:53,430
As the mastermind behind the plan, I am well aware of this, but since you find it necessary, I don't mind doing a full debrief and review.

1530
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:59,010
The original plan was to immobilize the enemies with a stun grenade after breaking through the door.

1531
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:06,270
Rachi and I would lay down the suppressive fire from the front, while you and Harpsy would circle around and rescue the hostages.

1532
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,190
Yes, that's about right.

1533
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:12,110
You are correct, and you did your part.

1534
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:16,050
But your unexpected action affected the whole situation.

1535
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,530
Well Rod raises an eyebrow in acknowledgement.

1536
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:24,250
Indeed, I decided to deviate from the plan to eliminate a certain unit.

1537
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:34,230
I don't know why there was a chandelier in the lab, but I bet the interior designer who put it there would be glad to know that their fancy light fixture was the key to our victory.

1538
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,890
If there were designers at level 2, that is.

1539
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:43,370
Has it occurred to you that actively altering the environment could put us at a disadvantage?

1540
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:48,850
I think you should make it clear what exactly you're getting at to avoid any misunderstanding.

1541
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:58,930
In other words, scattering glass elsewhere was exactly conducive to our subsequent actions or withdrawal.

1542
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,990
Shards of broken glass do no damage to doll frames.

1543
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:03,390
Yeah!

1544
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:05,210
We're not weak!

1545
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:07,950
Yes, but they do harm...

1546
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:08,770
Okay, who cares about that?

1547
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:11,250
Okay, they just harmed them a little bit, okay?

1548
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,530
We can fix them up.

1549
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:13,950
We just removed the glass.

1550
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:14,970
It's fine.

1551
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,870
They're getting rescued, aren't they?

1552
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:20,070
Pardon?

1553
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,670
Well Rod is confused for a moment.

1554
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:28,090
We have no medical dolls on our team.

1555
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:29,730
Oh, okay, never mind.

1556
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:30,410
That's an issue.

1557
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:31,610
I thought we had doctors.

1558
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:32,010
Oops.

1559
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,530
Why did we not program these?

1560
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,710
Why did we add a code in there?

1561
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:38,790
For them to...

1562
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:39,190
I don't know.

1563
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:40,090
Simple...

1564
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:41,970
CPI training.

1565
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:50,590
If a hostage gets injured and infected under such circumstances, we want to be able to fully complete our...

1566
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:51,890
Okay, that's an issue.

1567
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:54,570
I thought we had like simple med kits or something.

1568
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:57,970
You seem to have overlooked a very important detail.

1569
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,350
Our hostages were simulated.

1570
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:02,950
You're right.

1571
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,550
But we're in the real world.

1572
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:09,070
Our standpoints would be completely reversed if we don't consider the hostages.

1573
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:12,170
We would be the one who end up in the recycling plant.

1574
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,770
Though, I suppose the pain wouldn't last long.

1575
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:22,670
No matter how many points we score in level 2, we'll just be T-Dos whose lives are ruined by video games.

1576
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:26,410
To be fair, that would be quite fitting for me.

1577
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:28,430
Adam, thank you for the Akasupa!

1578
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,850
Thank you, thank you!

1579
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:30,770
Hi Toki!

1580
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:31,750
Today's my birthday!

1581
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,990
And I took time off work because I might as well be sad at home.

1582
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:36,210
Getting old is cringe.

1583
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:36,570
No!

1584
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,170
You get to spend time here with us!

1585
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,050
Happy birthday to you!

1586
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:42,790
Happy birthday to you!

1587
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,670
Happy birthday dear Adam!

1588
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,390
Happy birthday to you!

1589
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:46,850
Yeah!

1590
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,230
Happy birthday Adam!

1591
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,170
I hope you feel better!

1592
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:53,850
Also, you should really have notified us before making such a drastic move.

1593
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:57,690
If you looked at the replay, Rachi clearly wasn't aware of your intentions.

1594
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:01,890
And so she couldn't coordinate with you, despite being right next to you.

1595
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:04,630
Even if we suck, we should all suck together.

1596
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:07,210
The battlefield is ever-changing.

1597
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,050
Opportunities wait for no one.

1598
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:11,990
Surely you know that as well.

1599
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:19,810
You can't deny the fact that by dropping the chandelier on our enemies, it greatly reduced the threat they posed as well.

1600
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:24,730
As the time it took to mount the rescue, thus increasing the hostage's chance to survive.

1601
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,310
Oh my god, you two get a broom.

1602
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:27,790
You guys are still arguing about this.

1603
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:34,930
Even if in the real world, lording at the scene would be more dangerous for the hostages than getting cut by shards of glass.

1604
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:38,610
Like, they're all debating about the one thing for like...

1605
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:42,070
It feels like they've been debating about this one thing for like 10 years now.

1606
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:50,510
But if the chandelier had been rigged with a bomb or a grenade, things would turn out very differently.

1607
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:51,870
Get a room, you two!

1608
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,810
So what do you want me to do?

1609
01:03:56,630 --> 01:04:02,250
Apologize for something that didn't happen, but could have happened in your pathetic, delusional paranoia?

1610
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:03,150
Ho ho!

1611
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,070
Focus on the results, Vector.

1612
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,230
Like a normal doll would.

1613
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,630
Since the detention...

1614
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,810
Oh wait, there were other people in this room?

1615
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,750
Like I...

1616
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:18,270
That's awkward.

1617
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:20,070
It definitely did not feel like it.

1618
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,130
Toxic Yuri.

1619
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:29,370
Raunchi looks back and forth between her teammates and is about to say something.

1620
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:30,510
Knock knock!

1621
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,990
A knock on the glass interrupts the confrontation.

1622
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,370
Dolls all look towards the sound.

1623
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:37,450
Commander?

1624
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:38,550
Wait, that's me!

1625
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:40,050
Hello?

1626
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:46,670
I attract my gaze from a screen in the training room and direct my attention to Vector, who has jogged up to me.

1627
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:48,170
What is it, Commander?

1628
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,330
Are you here to supervise or training?

1629
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:52,130
No, that's me!

1630
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:53,510
I came to talk to you.

1631
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,330
So, isn't the score a bit low for you guys?

1632
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:57,270
Okay, look.

1633
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:59,670
I was learning the controls, guys.

1634
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:04,690
Like, the score might have been low, but like, I was trying to learn.

1635
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,090
Yeah, I didn't handle the problem very well.

1636
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:16,550
We have very different habits and ways of thinking.

1637
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:20,130
The judgment process is proving a little challenging.

1638
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:27,270
I don't know if you know this, but rather than adjusting to each other, that sounded more like a full-blown argument to me.

1639
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:29,150
You heard it all then?

1640
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:33,390
Just a part of it, but things are getting pretty heated.

1641
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:37,130
The way I see it, you do work well as a team.

1642
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:41,630
But maybe things may go more smoothly if you communicate in some other ways.

1643
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,430
Klukai said as much.

1644
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:47,890
She told me to find an effective way of communicating with my teammates.

1645
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:51,030
But arguing is also a way of communicating, no?

1646
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:58,990
It may be a bit harsh, but through an argument, we can all effectively state our own needs and deepen our understanding.

1647
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:02,730
Okay, but like, arguing a lot is also not good too.

1648
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:07,350
Because then like, you know, you just have resentment and stuff to your teammates.

1649
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:16,410
Cutting remarks also serve as a regular reminder that this position of leadership just fell out of the sky for me, and that I have yet to prove myself worthy.

1650
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:17,910
Well, right.

1651
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,650
The change in the way she speaks was a bit dramatic.

1652
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:23,450
But I'm sure, she didn't mean it that way.

1653
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:25,310
I do wonder what it's gone through.

1654
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,830
Her tongue is much sharper than it used to be.

1655
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,770
It still beats my constant self-pity.

1656
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,630
At least she worked on becoming more persuasive.

1657
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:38,830
You see, on top of reaching an understanding, you also need to reach a consensus.

1658
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:43,630
You must also get Wellrod to trust your concern and judgement if you value cooperation.

1659
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:50,490
But right now, both you and Wellrod are still standing your ground, and trying to force each other to accept your respective views.

1660
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,370
WE GOTTA PUT THEM IN A ROOM!

1661
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:54,390
WE CAN'T SEPARATE THEM!

1662
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:00,190
Vector was appointed as the leader of 404 Combat Team by Klukai.

1663
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:07,470
It's clear to me that the biggest challenge that stands in her way of being a good team leader, has nothing to do with her combat performance.

1664
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,970
The problem is with her personality and style.

1665
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:12,830
Okay, she does have like a sort of resting bitch face, not gonna lie.

1666
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:15,410
Like, she is a bit cold to be here.

1667
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:17,030
Like, you don't really want to approach her.

1668
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:20,450
She fully acknowledged this problem, but that's all she does.

1669
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,690
She acknowledges it.

1670
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:27,210
I suppose deep down, even Vector herself doesn't believe that she is up to the task.

1671
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:33,090
Klukai may give her some pointers, but she isn't really the type to give any encouragement.

1672
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:38,170
Sorry, that might have been harsh, since you are the team leader.

1673
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:40,470
I'm sure you have your own way of managing your team.

1674
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,190
Right, back to subject.

1675
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:44,370
Have you seen the message that Klukai sent you?

1676
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:47,310
Mechie's training plan.

1677
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,610
I will be out on mission with Klukai.

1678
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:53,350
And Doris and Belka are also coming with us.

1679
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:59,170
Mechie's frame is still under calibration, so we will leave her behind on the Elmo for now.

1680
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:06,170
However, Klukai has put together a training program for Mechie because she's worried that Mechie is going to sleep the whole time we're away.

1681
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:10,890
And completely neglect her essential data calibration.

1682
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:15,970
She said you never replied to the message she has sent you, but she's busy preparing for the mission.

1683
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:18,150
So I came in to follow up on that.

1684
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,330
Oh, do I have a Mechie in my team?

1685
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:23,930
You want me to supervise Mechie's training?

1686
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:26,890
That's right.

1687
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:31,850
I believe Klukai would like combat team B to bring her along for her training as well.

1688
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:33,770
Don't go easy on her.

1689
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:36,370
Not even a 4v1 or a relay fight.

1690
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:41,130
4v1 would be a bit too...

1691
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:44,550
I've included all the things to note and precautions to take here.

1692
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:50,410
In any case, just make sure her head isn't always attached to her pillow.

1693
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,570
Fine.

1694
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:55,430
I hope Mechie won't find a fight against me too underwhelming.

1695
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:01,010
Basically, Klukai wants you to take over as Mechie's leader while she's away.

1696
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:04,990
So don't hold back and be as strict as you want with her, Vector.

1697
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:06,970
I'll do my best.

1698
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:10,870
But only if I can even wake Mechie and get her to attend her training.

1699
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:12,650
I want to see Mechie!

1700
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,030
Oh?

1701
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:21,370
Looks like our great team leader has switched careers and becomes a...

1702
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,030
Damn!

1703
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:23,750
Well, right.

1704
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,490
Oh, she is...

1705
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:29,230
Enemies to lovers!

1706
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:33,390
Let's call it a day.

1707
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,390
Submit your reports before 6.

1708
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,170
I'll read them through.

1709
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:41,450
After I finish supervising Mechie's combat simulation for today.

1710
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:42,450
Hmm.

1711
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:47,050
Harpsy speaks up a bit timidly from her corner.

1712
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,370
What is it?

1713
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:50,620
Actually...

1714
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:54,010
May I supervise Mechie's training?

1715
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:56,110
Huh?

1716
01:09:56,490 --> 01:10:00,070
You're actually volunteering for a mission, Harpsy?

1717
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:01,500
No.

1718
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:09,150
I was going to supervise Mechie's training to begin with as a favor of Deer.

1719
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:11,470
Why?

1720
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:22,130
Because the EW training module she is using to debug her data was specially developed by Deer at Cool Kai's request.

1721
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:25,830
I also participated in the development of the module.

1722
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:33,830
Since Deer has to disembarked and return to the safe zone, he asked me to monitor the operation of the module.

1723
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,550
An advanced tactical module?

1724
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,550
Sounds pretty interesting.

1725
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,270
Not really.

1726
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:41,610
It's all...

1727
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:42,190
Oh, she's cute.

1728
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,390
It's all really boring.

1729
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:50,870
So, you know, since I'm supposed to be doing it, please let me.

1730
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:53,250
I understand.

1731
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:58,710
However, since Kluca has assigned a mission to me, I must be present.

1732
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:01,010
Harpsy, you're staying with me.

1733
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:03,290
Okay.

1734
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:06,530
I'm staying too.

1735
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:08,150
What?

1736
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,890
Why are you also staying, Willrod?

1737
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:17,370
I would love to see if, for myself, what kind of advanced training team A undergoes.

1738
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:18,730
Problem?

1739
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:20,490
No.

1740
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:26,490
If Willrod is also here, then it's all over.

1741
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:31,210
In that case, BB, count me in as well.

1742
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:33,970
I'm sure you have better things to do.

1743
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:34,950
Wait, like...

1744
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:40,250
Assigned her to do something and now that her entire team is, like, part of it too?

1745
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,270
Like, what's the point of assigning this?

1746
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:44,750
It feels like a waste of, like, my resources.

1747
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:49,730
I want to spend more time with you, BB.

1748
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:50,550
Please?

1749
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:54,270
Suit yourself.

1750
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,870
Just make sure you submit your reports by 6.

1751
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:00,130
Oh.

1752
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:00,190
Oh.

1753
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:01,750
Yay!

1754
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:03,750
Completed my mission!

1755
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,720
Alright, confirm.

1756
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,220
Yeah, but they want to be closer to get there.

1757
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,740
Alright, so that was the event story.

1758
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:22,200
If you guys want to check out more of this story for this particular event, feel free...

1759
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,040
Like I said, you can check out the...

1760
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,980
Check out the link in my description and pinned in my chat.

1761
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,880
If you guys want to learn more about this story.

1762
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,960
I don't know, like...

1763
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,300
Oh.

1764
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,640
I know there was, like, a minigame section too.

1765
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,000
Do you guys know where it is?

1766
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:46,580
Where's...

1767
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:47,180
Uh...

1768
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:47,820
What's supply?

1769
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,080
Oh, is this a minigame?

1770
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,540
Not at this event?

1771
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,840
Oh, no minigames at this event?

1772
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,480
What's supply?

1773
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,000
What is this?

1774
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,660
Oh, it's for the event currency?

1775
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,800
Alright, let's see what auto is like.

1776
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:09,760
Alright.

1777
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,540
Combat start.

1778
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,520
Alright, I'm curious.

1779
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,760
Okay, how much better are they than me?

1780
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,180
Guys.

1781
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,380
They surely can't be better than me.

1782
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,900
My amazing gameplay.

1783
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:25,920
Oh my god.

1784
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,280
Okay, they're all dead.

1785
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,020
Oh.

1786
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:31,440
Alright.

1787
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,980
Maybe the game knows how to play the game better than...

1788
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:36,480
Maybe.

1789
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:37,560
Maybe.

1790
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,140
Okay, just a little better.

1791
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,440
Just...

1792
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,580
Just a little bit better, guys.

1793
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,440
Wait, it's done?

1794
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,280
Wait.

1795
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:57,420
But she's not done yet.

1796
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:58,680
Okay.

1797
01:13:59,400 --> 01:13:59,920
Alright.

1798
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,700
Maybe the game knows...

1799
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,320
Knows how to play better.

1800
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,280
She's...

1801
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,420
What do you need?

1802
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,460
What do you need?

1803
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:08,900
Alright.

1804
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:09,780
Now I know.

1805
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,440
Now I know, chat.

1806
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,720
Now I know.

1807
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,560
I learned.

1808
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,000
Okay.

1809
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,160
Good job.

1810
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,380
You finished it.

1811
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:23,520
Apparently, Kluka is all I need.

1812
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:24,420
Apparently.

1813
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:25,540
Okay.

1814
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:26,320
Anyway.

1815
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,140
Let me...

1816
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,500
There's something else I wanna...

1817
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,980
So, apparently there's like...

1818
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:31,360
A new achievement system.

1819
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,460
And then the accessory function.

1820
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,320
So like...

1821
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,540
How do I access the achievement system?

1822
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,060
It doesn't even need kills.

1823
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,780
It just hits.

1824
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:42,780
I...

1825
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,600
Okay.

1826
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,740
Alright, guys.

1827
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,540
I learned.

1828
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:46,920
Okay.

1829
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,060
I learned today.

1830
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,860
Oh, this is a time...

1831
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,480
Okay, so this is like all the new stuff.

1832
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:55,240
Oh.

1833
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,660
Click on commission?

1834
01:14:59,060 --> 01:14:59,620
Okay.

1835
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:00,880
Commission.

1836
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,780
Oh.

1837
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:04,760
Oh!

1838
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:06,780
Claim.

1839
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,320
Expansion drill.

1840
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,540
Journey with this.

1841
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,740
Claim off.

1842
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,880
Boundary push?

1843
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:16,220
Okay.

1844
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,440
I'll try a boundary push.

1845
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,400
Where is that?

1846
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,540
Is this?

1847
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,920
Uh...

1848
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,180
Team is ready?

1849
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,040
Wait, they're presets though.

1850
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:34,920
I want Vector.

1851
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,280
But Vector is so cool!

1852
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:40,380
She's so...

1853
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,900
Kukai was so strong!

1854
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,000
Use WSD to move your doll.

1855
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:47,280
Okay.

1856
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,300
Oh wait, I'm actually moving.

1857
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,300
They're explosives around them.

1858
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,380
Put them to good use.

1859
01:15:58,890 --> 01:15:59,630
There we go.

1860
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:02,550
That should explode.

1861
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:02,930
Yay!

1862
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:04,470
Wait, I'm gaming.

1863
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:07,850
Okay.

1864
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:11,810
Right here.

1865
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,050
This is...

1866
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:15,990
Okay, that's overkill.

1867
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:18,610
That's a little overkill.

1868
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,510
I'm not gonna lie.

1869
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:20,870
Oh, whoops.

1870
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:21,370
I'm on fire.

1871
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:21,710
Okay.

1872
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,990
I couldn't help it.

1873
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:25,610
Let me just...

1874
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:27,310
Point blanket.

1875
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,110
Real quick.

1876
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,210
Oh, is this like a stealth game?

1877
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:34,630
Okay.

1878
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:37,070
I'll shoot in between here.

1879
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:38,990
Alright.

1880
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,130
Oh, shit.

1881
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:41,870
Oh, fuck.

1882
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:43,770
Whoops.

1883
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:45,150
That's a swap.

1884
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:47,690
What else?

1885
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:51,390
Sorry, but...

1886
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:52,810
Maybe I shouldn't have stood...

1887
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:53,490
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1888
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:56,170
Maybe I should have stood next to her.

1889
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:56,950
Alright.

1890
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:57,990
It's okay.

1891
01:16:58,110 --> 01:16:59,990
I wanted to use the sniper anyway.

1892
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:00,970
I...

1893
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,350
Okay, she's stronger.

1894
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:05,570
Phew.

1895
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,070
Easy.

1896
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:10,930
What I thought explosions hurt, guys.

1897
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,310
I know now.

1898
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:15,810
Guys, I know now.

1899
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:17,690
Explosions are not good.

1900
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,170
I think you just can't do it while inside.

1901
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:21,730
Then we maybe simply move around.

1902
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:24,290
Okay.

1903
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,890
I mean, I've been like moving.

1904
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:27,450
Oh, dry.

1905
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:29,350
Oh, they can't detect me if I'm in there.

1906
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:29,910
It doesn't matter.

1907
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:30,730
I'm still gonna kill him.

1908
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:31,630
Phew.

1909
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,000
Oh, doesn't know where I am.

1910
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,120
Yoink.

1911
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,180
There we go.

1912
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:43,780
Phew.

1913
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,280
Yeah, he hurt.

1914
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:47,280
Doesn't know.

1915
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:49,940
Phew.

1916
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:52,420
That's right.

1917
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,220
Oh, shit.

1918
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,100
How did he know?

1919
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,240
How did he know?

1920
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:57,460
Oh.

1921
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,920
How did he know?

1922
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,320
It knew.

1923
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:06,580
Ew.

1924
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:07,500
Ew.

1925
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,960
Sentries don't have ears!

1926
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:10,940
They're robots!

1927
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,220
Alright.

1928
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:15,900
It's fine.

1929
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:16,220
See?

1930
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,020
I still won.

1931
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,880
I still won, guys.

1932
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:21,460
He didn't actually know.

1933
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:25,820
Alright.

1934
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,120
I'm being more careful now.

1935
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:29,320
I'm being more careful now.

1936
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:29,780
Wait, what?

1937
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,660
Oh, no.

1938
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:33,880
Wait.

1939
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,160
Come on.

1940
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,660
Boss units cannot be assassinated.

1941
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,660
Attacking a boss unit will initiate a battle.

1942
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:39,960
Okay.

1943
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,380
Make sure you capitalize and oil barrels before initiating the battle.

1944
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:43,980
Oh, okay.

1945
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,040
I can do that.

1946
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:46,520
Alright.

1947
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:49,800
Climb.

1948
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:54,940
Okay.

1949
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:56,680
Okay.

1950
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,100
Yellow barrel.

1951
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,480
Can't hurt me this time.

1952
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:01,660
Okay.

1953
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,000
Now what?

1954
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,420
Oh, now he's angry.

1955
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:06,760
Oh!

1956
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,960
I was like...

1957
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,540
Yeah?

1958
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,100
Oh, he's angry.

1959
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:12,620
He's...

1960
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,200
He's not happy with what I did.

1961
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,120
It's fine.

1962
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:19,600
Okay.

1963
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,280
I have this, though.

1964
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,400
I have gun.

1965
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,480
Oh, thank you.

1966
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,380
Thank you.

1967
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:25,920
Thank you.

1968
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:27,520
Let's go.

1969
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:29,220
Okay.

1970
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:33,060
My two characters might be almost dead because I might have...

1971
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:38,020
May or may not have accidentally stood on some explosives.

1972
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,280
Yes.

1973
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,100
Please heal me.

1974
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:42,960
Please heal me, guys.

1975
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,000
Alright.

1976
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:47,980
It's okay.

1977
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,040
It's okay.

1978
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:50,700
She's fine.

1979
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,140
Pew pew!

1980
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:53,980
Pew pew!

1981
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:54,620
Yay!

1982
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,000
Yay!

1983
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:01,380
We did it!

1984
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,000
See, it's just that easy.

1985
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,100
How do I get down?

1986
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:06,640
Okay.

1987
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,300
Down I go.

1988
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,220
What's this?

1989
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,580
Okay, it's only level one crisis.

1990
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,160
Oh, I can click when the area has been full.

1991
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:26,000
You can tap the evacuation button next to the mini-map.

1992
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:26,860
To end.

1993
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:27,340
Okay.

1994
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,980
I don't need to yet.

1995
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:30,580
Oh, wait.

1996
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,620
I want to open this first.

1997
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,600
And then open this.

1998
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:34,980
Okay, what did I get?

1999
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:35,600
Yay!

2000
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:35,680
Yay!

2001
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:38,340
I did it!

2002
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,220
Oh, that was fun.

2003
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,500
I like this game mode.

2004
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:41,960
Alright.

2005
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,120
And I got everything.

2006
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,500
I should be able to evacuate safely now.

2007
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:47,320
Yay!

2008
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:53,410
Okay, a new point unlocked.

2009
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:53,810
Ooh!

2010
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:55,290
I have so many gold items.

2011
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,410
I like gold items.

2012
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,590
Yeah, only a little damage.

2013
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:02,370
I should not have, like...

2014
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:07,170
May I have fucked up by standing next to the explosive, but that's okay.

2015
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:09,650
Uh...

2016
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:11,010
That's okay.

2017
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:11,690
Aww!

2018
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,890
I'm sending her out, right?

2019
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:17,810
Oh, this is me dispatching them.

2020
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:20,470
Oh!

2021
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:24,550
Wait, I want to see...

2022
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:25,730
Oh, they're so cute!

2023
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,130
I want to send Vector out.

2024
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:28,970
Vector, where are you?

2025
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:29,770
Do your job.

2026
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:31,770
Where's Vector?

2027
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,330
Oh, there she is.

2028
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:34,310
Do your job, Vector.

2029
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:36,050
I'm not saying Klu...

2030
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:37,090
Klukayo.

2031
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:39,150
That's cute.

2032
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:39,890
That's cute.

2033
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,490
I like the use of 2D there.

2034
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:45,090
Yeah, the use of chibi dolls there.

2035
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:46,130
That's really cute.

2036
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:48,010
Um...

2037
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:48,470
But yeah!

2038
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:50,550
Good shout out again!

2039
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:51,650

2041
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:53,310
Um...

2042
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:55,950
Mika and Sunborn for sponsoring me!

2043
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:57,990
To check out Girls From Line 2 Exilium!

2044
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:01,550
I think, honestly, this is my favorite part of the game.

2045
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:02,790
Wait, where's...

2046
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,150
There was a girl I really liked.

2047
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:10,190
Oh, she's not...

2048
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:11,410
She's wearing a different outfit.

2049
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,910
Wait.

2050
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,270
Change outfit, please.

2051
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:18,350
Alright.

2052
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:20,390
Oh, she's so cute!

2053
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:22,130
I love her swimsuit!

2054
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,270
Wait, YouTube...

2055
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,650
YouTube, would I be okay?

2056
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:34,510
Awww, there's her listening to music!

2057
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:35,910
Awww!

2058
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:36,490

Observing...

2063
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:41,890
Deep sleep...

2064
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,930
Chill...

2065
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:44,870
Okay, we're not...

2066
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:45,030
Awww!

2067
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:46,610
Awww!

2068
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:48,150

Awww!

2074
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:57,390
We're not doing that.

2075
01:22:57,730 --> 01:23:00,250
We're looking at her beautiful face.

2076
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:00,730
Okay?

2077
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:03,190
Her eyes are up... Okay.

2078
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:05,470
Her eyes are up here.

2079
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:23,670
It's not... Guys, if you want to experience... If you want to see it herself, guys... If you want to see yourself... What it was going to look like... You can click on the link in my description... And in my chat...

2080
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:25,550
And download Girl's Frontline to yourself.

01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:27,130
And check it out yourself, guys.

2082

Yay!

01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:41,210
Alright.

01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:41,630
Nice.

2086
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:42,510
Alright.

2087
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:43,410
What are dolls doing?

2088
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:44,010
Check out.

2089
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:46,870
I want to look like... Okay.

Let's... I want... There was like... Where's the cat?

01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:49,250
Oh!

2092
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:50,470
The cat girl's cute.

2093
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:51,710
She's cute.

2094
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:53,570
What's her different outfit?

2095
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:54,930
Oh, porn?

2096
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:55,310
Oh!

2097
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:57,870
Oh!

2098
01:23:57,870 --> 01:23:57,930
Oh!

2099
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:58,150
Oh!

2100
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:58,390
Oh!

2101
01:23:58,570 --> 01:23:58,570
Oh!

2102
01:23:59,030 --> 01:23:59,750
Okay.

2103
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:01,050
What is...

2104
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:03,550
Okay.

2105
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:04,690
What are her poses?

2106
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:05,870
Just cute.

2107
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:07,370
Reading.

2108
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:09,490
Observation.

2109
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:09,930
Oh!

2110
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:13,230
She's like... Like...

2111
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:15,890
She heard... Her and fish.

2112
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:19,010
Then there's uh...

2113
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:23,400
And it hurts.

2114
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,600
She's playing with the cat ball and everything.

2115
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,780
We're observing, guys.

2116
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:31,340
We're observing.

2117
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,880
Alright, this is a good... This is good.

2118
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:48,620
Alright.

2119
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,800
I... Observing?

2120
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:52,680
What?

2121
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:56,340
We're observing, guys.

2122
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,760
You know the problem.

2123
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,160
Alright.

2124
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,040
But yes, that was really fun.

2125
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,060
I had a great time.

2126
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:13,640
Checking out Girls Frontline 2, Exilium, and all the features they had there.

2127
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,380
They definitely had a lot of different things you can do in the game.

2128
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,680
So, and... Oh my gosh.

2129
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,220
I'm gonna say the graphics is actually... I love the graphics for this game.

2130
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,420
Like, the 3D is so well... Oh wait!

2131
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,720
I forgot to give them gifts!

2132
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,320
Alright, give me a sec.

2133
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:40,540
I gotta give... I gotta... Wait, before we call it here, I gotta give the girl... I gotta give her a gift before we go.

2134
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:41,140
Where is she?

2135
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:42,760
The main girl.

2136
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,240
Alright.

2137
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,140
You want headphones?

2138
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,680
There you go.

2139
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:50,060
Wait, can I max it out?

2140
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:54,010
Wait, can I max it out?

2141
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:55,290
Can you love me now?

2142
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:00,110
You love me now?

2143
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:02,090
What happens?

2144
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:05,030
What happens?

2145
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:09,810
Oh, there you go!

2146
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,130
Love me more.

2147
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,350
Yes.

2148
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:18,230
Anything else?

2149
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,740
Don't worry, I have more.

2150
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:23,420
Don't worry.

2151
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:23,680
Don't worry.

2152
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,200
Don't worry.

2153
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,660
I have more for you.

2154
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:31,860
Nice.

2155
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,100
Don't worry.

2156
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:36,140
It's not over yet.

2157
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:39,080
Welcome to the tomato fire.

2158
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,180
Don't worry.

2159
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:43,800
I have more.

2160
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:47,060
Wait, what?

2161
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,420
I... What?

2162
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:51,800
I can... What?

2163
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,900
I can do...

2164
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:53,960
Alright, nice.

2165
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:54,020
Alright, nice.

2166
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:54,960
I'm level 5.

2167
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,620
Wait, is that... What do you mean?

2168
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,020
What do you mean?

2169
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:14,660
What do you... I gave you... My entire life!

2170
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:16,920
What do you mean?

2171
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:20,240
I can't... No!

2172
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,900
I can't... Which one?

2173
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:24,440
Who can?

2174
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:25,820
Guys.

2175
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,280
Who can?

2176
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:28,180
Who can?

2177
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,640
Who?

2178
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,620
Oh, I have her.

2179
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,340
Oh, my God.

2180
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,380
I already... Did I already marry her?

2181
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,320
Hello.

2182
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:50,400
Hello.

2183
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,480
Come, take my hand.

2184
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:02,380
And tell me that you need me by your side eternally.

2185
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:10,620
I will forever engrave this moment in my neural cloud to honor this once-in-a-lifetime victory.

2186
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,140
What's gonna happen?

2187
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,740
I expected this.

2188
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:24,640
After all, there's no way I would yield a place beside you to anyone else.

2189
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:25,860
She's my rebound.

2190
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,580
After... After I couldn't get Cheetah.

2191
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:40,420
She's... She's my rebound.

2192
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:41,940
That's...

2193
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,480
Like...

2194
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:50,640
That's... That's... That's... Don't... You don't say that.

2195
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:53,220
We all knew who we wanted first.

2196
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,120
The same.

2197
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,880
Wait, does she have a ring on it?

2198
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:02,980
There's no ring on it, though.

2199
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,560
Wait, who's next?

2200
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:05,960
Her?

2201
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,360
Wait, is she... Guys, I don't think I have enough.

2202
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,320
Oh, wait, I already married her.

2203
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:13,720
I think, right?

2204
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:15,540
Yeah.

2205
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:16,600
Oh, I can do it again.

2206
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:16,940
Oh.

2207
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,640
I have... Oh, my God, I have five rings.

2208
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,320
I have five.

2209
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,660
Gotta collect them all.

2210
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,400
Alright.

2211
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,080
Nice.

2212
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,160
Five wives!

2213
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,180
Let's go!

2214
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:47,650
For us, dolls, coming to this world is something we all truly look forward to.

2215
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:54,490
We might not be human, but there's still many wonderful things to experience, even in this messed up world.

2216
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:59,010
And meeting you was the most wonderful thing I have experienced so far.

2217
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:02,570
I hope you'll carry on traveling with me from now on.

2218
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:03,150
Yay!

2219
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:04,230
Two wives!

2220
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:08,010
You know what's better than two wives?

2221
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:12,470
I'm gonna make this world that has the commander in it a better place.

2222
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:14,270
Oh, nice.

2223
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:15,410
I got a...

2224
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:17,050
It's time.

2225
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:18,010
Three.

2226
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:21,250
Alright, where's Mechi?

2227
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:23,450
Someone's like, look at Mechi.

2228
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:25,690
I don't think I have Mechi.

2229
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:28,070
Do I have Mechi?

2230
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:28,830
I don't have her.

2231
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:31,110
She's so awesome.

2232
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:33,250
I already have three.

2233
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:34,270
Oh, my God.

2234
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:36,230
I do already have three.

2235
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:40,310
Oh, I don't have Mechi.

2236
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:41,130
Wait.

2237
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,390
Can I pull for Mechi?

2238
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:44,290
It's not too late.

2239
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:45,930
It's not...

2240
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:46,090
Wait.

2241
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:47,370
Is she pullable?

2242
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:47,510
Pull?

2243
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:49,630
Here?

2244
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:55,410
Not right now.

2245
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,290
It's too late.

2246
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:00,330
It's okay.

2247
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:02,230
Maybe we can have four.

2248
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:04,810
It's alright.

2249
01:31:05,930 --> 01:31:06,730
Don't worry.

2250
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:08,990
It's not too late, guys.

2251
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:10,370
Wait.

2252
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:11,790
Do I have...

2253
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:12,190
Wait.

2254
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:13,410
She's affinity three.

2255
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:14,650
Actually, no.

2256
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:15,650
I'm not feeling her.

2257
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:17,390
I'm not feeling her.

2258
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:17,850
Alright.

2259
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:18,670
Who is...

2260
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:20,050
Who is Hyun...

2261
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,430
Oh, my God.

2262
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:22,830
Okay.

2263
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:24,890
Let's look at Vepily.

2264
01:31:28,230 --> 01:31:28,990
Alright.

2265
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:31,130
I feel like you guys are gonna...

2266
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:35,210
Pondering.

2267
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:36,530
Observing.

2268
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:38,250
Reading.

2269
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:39,490
Alright.

2270
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:41,510
Let's see if we can get her.

2271
01:31:43,570 --> 01:31:45,390
Guys, I think I'm broke now.

2272
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:50,820
Wait.

2273
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:51,220
No.

2274
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:51,600
No.

2275
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,520
I'm definitely broke.

2276
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,940
I'm definitely broke.

2277
01:31:57,820 --> 01:31:58,300
Wait.

2278
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,060
There's still hope.

2279
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,140
There's still hope.

2280
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:02,720
No!

2281
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,540
I can't have four.

2282
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,560
I can't...

2283
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:07,860
Oh, wait.

2284
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:08,180
I can't...

2285
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:08,420
Wait.

2286
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,120
It doesn't matter.

2287
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,480
Four is all it takes.

2288
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:11,940
Oh, no.

2289
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:12,640
It does matter.

2290
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:13,180
Never mind.

2291
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:13,880
I need five.

2292
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:15,060
God damn it.

2293
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,500
God damn it.

2294
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:17,840
I only...

2295
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,600
It's okay.

2296
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,980
Me and my three wives.

2297
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:21,720
It's alright.

2298
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,520
I have three wives and that's all.

2299
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:24,900
Ooh.

2300
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:26,520
Wait.

2301
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,240
Is this...

2302
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,440
This is the one I have, right?

2303
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:29,600
Which one is this outfit?

2304
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,120
Oh, that's so cute.

2305
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,140
Oh, they're all so cute.

2306
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:35,680
Okay.

2307
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:36,620
I like this one more.

2308
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:39,100
I think I like the embroidered.

2309
01:32:42,530 --> 01:32:43,170
It's alright.

2310
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:45,050
I'm okay.

2311
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,830
I'm satisfied with four...

2312
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:46,930
Three.

2313
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:49,710
Alright.

2314
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:54,250
I wanna know what it's like.

2315
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,670
Go in.

2316
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,540
Oh, she...

2317
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:07,260
Yay!

2318
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:10,980
Make sure you think this through, okay?

2319
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:12,620
No walking it back.

2320
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:13,100
What?

2321
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,020
Are you kidding me?

2322
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,740
It's too late to regret it now.

2323
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,820
This time, I'll follow you no matter where you go.

2324
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:26,920
So, whatever it is, whether it's the black zone or the white zone, I'll make sure you realize this is the most sensible and perfect choice you've ever made.

2325
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,440
Oh, she's a tsundere.

2326
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:31,260
Look.

2327
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,140
We'll never be separated again after this.

2328
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,420
It's not like I was looking forward to this that much.

2329
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:38,240
Yay!

2330
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,040
Three wives!

2331
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:41,820
Yay!

2332
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:45,760
It's alright.

2333
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,400
I'm okay with three.

2334
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,000
Wait.

2335
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,600
Oh, I keep forgetting.

2336
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:50,380
I was like, wait a minute.

2337
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:50,880
There's a...

2338
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,440
That's...

2339
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,260
I can't marry her.

2340
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:53,360
I can't...

2341
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:56,340
Oh.

2342
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,380
It's okay.

2343
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:58,280
We'll put it...

2344
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:59,040
Emotions.

2345
01:33:59,320 --> 01:33:59,620
Wait.

2346
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,020
What?

2347
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,000
Do I have more emotions when I'm...

2348
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:03,620
Whoa!

2349
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:04,640
Oh.

2350
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:15,780
Whoa.

2351
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,080
Whoa.

2352
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:21,500
Whoa.

2353
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:29,100
All right.

2354
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,420
We'll put it at...

2355
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:30,800
What was it?

2356
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,020
Was Saber that was good?

2357
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:32,720
Or was it...

2358
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,280
I don't know.

2359
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:35,640
Okay.

2360
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:36,320
We'll put it here.

2361
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,400
Hey, guys.

2362
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:39,420
That was a...

2363
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:40,280
That was a...

2364
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,500
That was a great game.

2365
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,000
It was nice checking out girls' front line to Exilium for the first time.

2366
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,020
Shout out again to Sunborn and Mika team for sponsoring me.

2367
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:49,740
Um...

2368
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:50,280
Oh, you see that?

2369
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,600
That's my ring right there.

2370
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:53,220
Or is it...

2371
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:53,340
Wait.

2372
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:54,100
Where is it?

2373
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:56,460
That's my ring right there.

2374
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,560
We're married.

2375
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:58,280
We're...

2376
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,860

Uh...

2380
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:11,160
Like I said, clicking the link pinned in the chat and in the description helps out a lot.

2381
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:12,460
And, uh...

2382
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,620

2383
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:15,220
Uh...

2384
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,000
Play around with all the different features.

2385
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:18,840
Look into the story as well.

2386
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:19,620
Um...

2387
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:21,080
Thank you guys for coming, everybody.

2388
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:21,720
Uh...

2389
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:23,060
Again, thank you again to the sponsor.

2390
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,420
As always, everybody.

2391
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,640
Stay hydrated.

2392
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,540
Posture check.

2393
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:28,260
Get up and move around to get that...

2394
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:28,680
Blood Flour.

2395
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:31,060
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2396
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:31,820
Cause...

2397
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:32,860
You deserve it.

2398
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,260
I'll see you guys next...

2399
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:34,920
Wait, let me...

2400
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,880
Let me give you...

2401
01:35:41,670 --> 01:35:42,370
Okay, here.

2402
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:43,710
I'll give you guys a little.

2403
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:44,330
Okay.

2404
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:49,350
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2405
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:51,570
Bye, guys.

2406
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:52,850
Bye.
