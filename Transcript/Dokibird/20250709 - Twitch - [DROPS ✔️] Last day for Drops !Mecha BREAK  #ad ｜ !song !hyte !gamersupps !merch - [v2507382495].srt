1
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,110
Wow!

2
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,650
Hello, everybody!

3
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,050
Hello, hello!

4
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,090
Today is the last day for my sponsored streams for Mecha Break!

5
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:22,610
Yes!

6
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,330
So, if you guys didn't know, um, if you, uh, uh, there's Twitch drops right now for Mecha Break at the moment.

7
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,690
I'm trying to find the PNG for us.

8
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,170
Hahaha!

9
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,970
So, if you guys didn't know, um, by watching these streams, you are eligible to get a Twitch drop.

10
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,010
Not eligible, what's the word?

11
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,270
You are, you will get, not eligible, because you will get it.

12
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:45,790
Hahaha!

13
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,710
But, yes, you'll get a, uh, all the Catgirl accessories for your pilot, yes!

14
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,910
Uh, I wonder if the guys can wear this, too.

15
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,270
Ooh!

16
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:55,770
Hahaha!

17
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:57,570
Hahaha!

18
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,030
Um, but yes, and today is the last day for this.

19
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,350
So, uh, I'll be doing a two-hour stream today.

20
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,630
Um, and on the last hour, we will be doing custom lobbies, too.

21
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:20,270
So, um, if you guys want to join in on the custom lobbies and want to play with me, um, all you have to do is exclamation point Mecha Break or click on the link that is, uh, pinned in the chat right now.

22
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,470
Um, download the game.

23
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,350
It is free to play.

24
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:30,050
For those who don't know or haven't caught the last two streams, um, Mecha Break is a free-to-play Mecha Shooter, third-person Mecha Shooter.

25
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,370
So, um, so, there is three different game modes.

26
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:41,750
There is Hero Shooter mode, which is a, uh, regular, uh, 6v6, uh, Mecha fight.

27
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,390
There is Extraction mode, and there is 3v3 Deathmatch mode.

28
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,290
So, if you, like, depending on what type of, like, what type of experience you want, you can choose between all three.

29
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,930
And, um, it comes with 12 free Mechas that you can play.

30
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,990
Like, 12, uh, 12, uh, different types of characters that you can play.

31
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,310
And there are three different roles.

32
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,830
There's, uh, DPS, Support, and I think, I think it's, like, Sniper, Support, and Tank.

33
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,690
Oh, wait, not Sniper.

34
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,410
What was it?

35
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,890
It was DPS, Support, and Tank.

36
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,110
So, just, like, what you see in normally, normal Hero Shooters.

37
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,730
But, yes!

38
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:21,970
I'll be doing my last Mecha, I don't know if it'll be my last Mecha Breakstream, but it'll be the last, um, Mecha Breakstream for this promotion, uh, for the Twitch drops.

39
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,870
So, let's get back into it.

40
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:31,550
Um, also, guys, I found out yesterday, um, because, you know how I got a new, uh, I got PC last year?

41
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,350
A new PC last year?

42
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:41,210
Um, so, I found out last year, yesterday, that I've been playing with Mouse Acceleration on this entire time.

43
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,570
Because I forgot to turn it off when I got my new, when I got my PC at that time.

44
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,610
And I never noticed, because I can't tell.

45
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,170
I can't tell!

46
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,050
Because, yeah, because, like, okay, I only found out, because I was trying to tweak some settings last night.

47
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,350
And then, I was, like, looking at my mouse, and it says Mouse Acceleration was on.

48
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,390
And I don't know how long it's been.

49
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,010
I don't know.

50
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,290
Um, yeah, because it's on as default.

51
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:24,070
And I, I can't believe I've made it so far in Marvel Rivals playing with Mouse Acceleration on.

52
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:31,230
Because, um, I've never, look, guys, I've, I've never noticed.

53
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,710
I don't know how people notice.

54
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,470
So, I can notice.

55
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,910
Okay, so, it's crazy.

56
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,310
Okay, I found out about this recently.

57
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,450
But, it's literally, like, like, human diff.

58
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,570
Like, an actual skill diff.

59
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,650
But, I was talking to one of my friends.

60
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,750
And he was, like, how did you not notice?

61
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,050
And I was, like, I don't know.

62
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,330
I don't know the difference.

63
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,850
I literally don't know the difference.

64
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,990
And then he was, like, bro, I can tell even when my DPI is off.

65
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,250
I mean, which is fine.

66
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,130
Because, you know, like, you can tell when it's faster or whatever.

67
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,210
But, like, this guy, um, he's, like, a pro gamer.

68
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,610
He's one of the, you know, I'm friends with a lot of pro players.

69
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:20,210
And, like, apparently, pro players, when they move their mouse, they can tell exactly what DPI it is.

70
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,930
And, like, if they have mouse acceleration on.

71
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,870
So, like, so, like, he would be, like, he would be, like, okay, I'm moving my mouse.

72
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,510
This is 600 DPI.

73
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,990
I'm moving my mouse.

74
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,910
This is 800.

75
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:44,290
So, they can tell, pro players can actually tell exactly what DPI they're playing on without having to look at it.

76
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,210
Like, they can pinpoint the numbers.

77
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:46,970
Like, yes, okay.

78
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,750
Like, and then, like, he's, like, okay, you press these buttons.

79
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,830
He's, like, okay, so this is my mouse.

80
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,290
And you press these buttons.

81
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,230
And I can tell, like, exactly what DPI I'm on.

82
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:02,110
And I was, like, what?

83
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,930
I was, like, yeah.

84
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,070
And he's, like, no, like, pro players know the difference.

85
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,810
Because we have to know the difference between, like, and then he's, like, yeah.

86
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:17,530
And I know if I have mouse acceleration on because I can feel the change in my mouse if mouse acceleration is on.

87
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,770
I'm, like, what the?

88
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,890
I was just, like, I was, like, what?

89
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:36,120
I... I didn't... I... I just... I don't know.

90
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,720
I don't know how they do it.

91
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,300
I don't... It's actually crazy.

92
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,040
And they can tell exactly if mouse acceleration is on or not, too.

93
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,060
Like, just by moving their mouse.

94
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,280
And, like, it's actually skill diff.

95
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,700
Actual... Actual skill diff for me.

96
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,740
No, I couldn't tell!

97
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,780
Being able to feel mouse acceleration is free.

98
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,620
No, it's not!

99
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,920
I can't tell!

100
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
I literally don't know!

101
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,560
I don't know!

102
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,100
I didn't know until now!

103
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,800
Until yesterday!

104
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,720
The thing is, back in Overwatch, when I got top 500 in Overwatch, I also had mouse...

105
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,500
Top 500 in Overwatch and Apex, I also had mouse acceleration on.

106
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,760
Because I didn't know.

107
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,280
I...

108
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,960
Because I would...

109
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:31,460
Every time I get a new PC, I kept... I would keep it on by default, and it would be on.

110
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,860
And then, like, someone else would find out for me that I had them on.

111
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,240
Because I always forget to check.

112
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,380
I always forget to check if mouse acceleration is on.

113
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,280
Anyway.

114
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,960
I'm not playing with mouse acceleration anymore.

115
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,980
I found that out yesterday.

116
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,220
So, I am a changed person.

117
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,640
The weights come off now.

118
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,580
I never check.

119
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,060
I always never check.

120
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,540
So, for those who don't know how to check.

121
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:07,900
Okay.

122
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,080
So, it's basically...

123
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,240
You go to mouse settings.

124
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,060
Okay.

125
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,020
And I...

126
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,980
I keep forgetting.

127
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,620
So, you go to mouse settings.

128
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,800
And it's the enhanced pointer precision.

129
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,140
Precision.

130
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,180
Precision.

131
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,060
Precision?

132
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,680
I don't know how to fucking pronounce it.

133
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,540
Prec...

134
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,720
I'm pronouncing it wrong.

135
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,500
I don't fucking know.

136
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
So, I am...

137
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,720
We're tired.

138
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,240
Um...

139
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,980
But it was this.

140
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,980
I had...

141
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,900
I had this on.

142
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,860
This was on this entire time.

143
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,400
For the last year, by the way.

144
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,320
Uh...

145
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,280
This...

146
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,660
This was on for the last year, at least.

147
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,840
Uh...

148
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,380
Oopsie.

149
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,000
So, basically...

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,560
What I've...

151
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,520
I've been playing Marvel Rivals with this on.

152
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,640
I don't know how I got that far.

153
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,640
I really, generally don't know.

154
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,560
Um...

155
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,920
But I thought that was...

156
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,140
Uh...

157
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,720
I have to turn mine off now, too.

158
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,780
I told you!

159
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,860
You don't...

160
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,220
No!

161
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,000
It's...

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,820
You always...

163
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,620
You always forget.

164
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,120
And you're totally not turning it off right now, too.

165
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:15,880
Uh...

166
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,520
Yeah, I got top 500 with that on.

167
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,620
I've been playing...

168
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,100
Um...

169
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,840
I've been playing it with that on this entire time.

170
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,760
Which is absolutely fucking crazy.

171
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,640
I...

172
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,420
No way!

173
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:28,820
I see!

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,660
I told you!

175
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,360
It's not...

176
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,080
It's...

177
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,660
It's not something that's, like...

178
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,140
The first thing you do.

179
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,220
It's not something that I do.

180
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,480
Um...

181
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,980
Um...

182
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,640
Anyway...

183
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,180
Uh...

184
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,020
Yeah, so...

185
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,780
It's actually crazy.

186
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,480
I was not expecting that.

187
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:47,920
I...

188
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,900
I thought I had...

189
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,840
Because I always...

190
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,780
I, like...

191
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,380
Someone will find out for me.

192
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,400
And then...

193
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,240
Um...

194
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,540
Um...

195
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,820
Because, like, I had to...

196
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,620
Like, they were...

197
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,620
Like, I was trying to fix some settings and stuff.

198
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,960
So I had my friend help me.

199
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,980
And they're like, Oh, wait.

200
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,800
Check your mouse settings.

201
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,860
And I checked my mouse settings.

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,420
And they're like, You have...

203
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,980
My friend was like...

204
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,860
I have mouse acceleration on.

205
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,520
I'm like...

206
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:12,960
Wait.

207
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,500
Wait.

208
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,880
And then my friend was like...

209
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,640
How did he not know?

210
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,340
I...

211
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,760
I'm like...

212
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,080
What?

213
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,620
You know, like...

214
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,660
Like, that face when you're like...

215
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,140
Oh.

216
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,380
Oh.

217
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,840
Um...

218
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,780
I just don't notice.

219
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,820
I don't notice at all.

220
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,260
But, like, subconsciously.

221
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,540
It actually, like...

222
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,260
Affects me subconsciously.

223
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,660
But, like...

224
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,880
Um...

225
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,700
Um...

226
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,500
I do get better when it's off.

227
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,400
But I definitely, like...

228
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,420
Uh...

229
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,760
Uh...

230
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,520
I definitely, like, don't notice it.

231
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,180
I...

232
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,880
I can't tell.

233
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,640
Like, I...

234
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,080
Can't tell consciously.

235
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,900
But subconsciously, I do perform better with it off.

236
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,420
Yeah.

237
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,900
How do I know I get better if you don't...

238
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,800
It's because...

239
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,360
When I turn it off...

240
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,780
My gameplay improves.

241
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,400
That's like...

242
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,540
It's like...

243
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,920
Gaming 101.

244
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,580
I still can't believe pros can tell the...

245
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,960
Can, like, tell the difference.

246
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,900
Like...

247
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,260
Like...

248
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,220
When it's, like...

249
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,600
With the DPI and...

250
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,140
Mouse to sell.

251
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,940
And everything.

252
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,520
Like, um...

253
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,100
Because, like...

254
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Okay, so...

255
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:25,920
Um...

256
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,360
Um...

257
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,300
My friend...

258
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,340
He was also, like...

259
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,860
Yeah, like...

260
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,820
When I'm at, like, a gaming cafe...

261
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,000
I would literally, like...

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,980
If there's no, like, settings for it...

263
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,640
On the screen...

264
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,720
Like, you know how, like...

265
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,600
Um...

266
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,420
Uh...

267
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,380
For G Pro...

268
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,840
Uh...

269
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,620
They have, like...

270
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:39,900
The...

271
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,680
For Logitech...

272
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,260
They have, like, a special app for...

273
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,060
Like, on...

274
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,380
Um...

275
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,900
App on the PC where you can adjust your DPI...

276
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Like...

277
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,200
Um...

278
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,760
On the app.

279
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,980
But then, like...

280
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,720
Some gaming PCs...

281
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,480
Apparently...

282
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,720
They, um...

283
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,200
You can only adjust it with your mouse.

284
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,400
So you have to press the buttons on your mouse.

285
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,460
So, like...

286
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,180
If you go...

287
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,000
You go in...

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,860
Assuming, like, you know...

289
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,820
The default...

290
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,300
Um...

291
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,360
The default, like, DPIs and stuff...

292
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,640
Um...

293
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,460
Apparently, like...

294
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,580
Pro players who go to...

295
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,700
Gaming PCs and stuff to practice for bootcamp.

296
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,740
They don't need the app.

297
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,500
They literally just press the button, feel it out, and know exactly when their DPI for it.

298
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,660
They'll be like, oh, okay.

299
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,800
800.

300
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,760
Like, press the button and then feel it.

301
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Okay, that's 1,200.

302
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,360
Press the button and then, like, I can't tell.

303
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,260
I legitimately, I tried it out myself.

304
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,880
I, like, pressed buttons and I'd be like, okay, which is my 800 DPI?

305
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,980
I couldn't tell.

306
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,040
I got confused.

307
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,300
I got lost.

308
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,240
I was so lost trying to figure out what was my DPI.

309
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,800
When I'm, like, on someone, like, if I'm, like, trying to figure it out.

310
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,020
Yeah, I'd be so lost.

311
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,240
Uh, Brainy, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

312
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,540
Thank you.

313
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,220
Thank you.

314
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,760
Thank you for the 100 biddies.

315
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,140
Thank you.

316
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,860
Thank you.

317
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,080
Um, anyway.

318
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,980
Yeah, anyway, so...

319
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,300
Now I, my weights are off, so I should be a better player now, right?

320
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:13,980
Uh...

321
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,420
You're not... Okay, like, if it's, like, you know, 200 DPI, we're in, like, 1600.

322
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,140
I can tell if it's, um...

323
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,820
I could tell if it's, like, you know, uh, low.

324
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,340
But if it's, like, you know, 800 DPI versus...

325
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
What was... What's the default?

326
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,720
It's, like, 800, 1200.

327
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,100
What was it?

328
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,980
It's, like...

329
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,760
It's, like...

330
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,060
Was it 400, 800, and 1200 DPI?

331
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,460
Those are the three, right?

332
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,300
For the default ones?

333
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,600
Um, I can't tell for the default, usually.

334
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,540
Then 1600?

335
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,640
I can't tell between, like...

336
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,020
Sometimes, like...

337
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,760
It's hard for me to figure out which one's 400, 800, and 1600.

338
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
It's a little hard.

339
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,040
Cause I'm... I get, like, super confused.

340
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,560
I...

341
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,840
Like...

342
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,480
I, like...

343
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,820
I just get very confused, okay?

344
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,420
Cause I try to do it without, like, looking at my app.

345
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,000
And I, like...

346
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,020
I, like, throw myself into a confusion.

347
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,000
It's fun.

348
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,180
This is very fast-paced.

349
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,260
Just click heads.

350
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,060
No, this is very important.

351
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,100
This is very important to...

352
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,220
Clicking heads!

353
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,700
Alright.

354
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,580
Where's me?

355
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,340
Oh, I'm a baby.

356
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,260
Bomb ready.

357
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,040
That's right.

358
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,500
The sniper insta-lock.

359
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,860
We don't need...

360
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,360
Oh, my God.

361
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:36,920
Luminate.

362
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,440
Good luck.

363
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,960
Good luck, my Luminate player.

364
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,420
You'll need it.

365
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,760
I'm gonna be streaming two hours today.

366
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,320
Mhm.

367
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,620
Just click the head.

368
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,380
It'll be that easy.

369
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,600
Just click the head, right?

370
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,640
Let me in!

371
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,460
Of course I start...

372
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,540
Of course I start with my boy.

373
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,200
Sorry.

374
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,960
My hot, sexy girl.

375
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,260
Narukami.

376
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,820
That's right.

377
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,300
Of course I start with her.

378
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,780
She's my bae.

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,780
She's my bae.

380
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,360
This is the third stream, actually.

381
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,200
Not the second.

382
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,060
That's right.

383
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,960
I like how someone's first message is like...

384
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,140
Sexy robot!

385
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,080
He's like...

386
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,740
This is it.

387
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,380
This is where she got me.

388
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,920
I have to contribute to this chat now.

389
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,760
I...

390
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,100
I have to talk in this chat after that.

391
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,280
Why does a robot need an hourglass?

392
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,440
Why not?

393
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,800
It's for aerodynamics.

394
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,000
You won't understand.

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,960
You're not an engineer.

396
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,420
You don't understand.

397
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,040
You don't understand.

398
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,900
All my robot engineers will understand.

399
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,300
Exactly.

400
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,380
Why not?

401
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,080
It is for the aerodynamics, alright?

402
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,080
It makes robot move faster.

403
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,100
It's engineering robotics 101.

404
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,500
Fucking normies don't understand.

405
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,920
Basic engineering.

406
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,620
Oh my god.

407
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,260
Is this objective?

408
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,080
Oh my god.

409
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,460
Fuck!

410
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,260
That was objective base.

411
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,160
I hate that.

412
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,080
Oh my god.

413
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,200
Okay.

414
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,000
I guess I'll actually play as a sniper.

415
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,680
Okay.

416
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,400
Okay.

417
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,820
I need to, like, find, like, an actual sniper spot, though.

418
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,480
Alright.

419
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,100
There you go.

420
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,560
Oh wait.

421
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,580
Everybody's so far.

422
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,060
I see you.

423
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,420
That's right.

424
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,900
I can no-scope you.

425
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,420
I can no-scope you.

426
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:13,700
Okay.

427
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,060
I actually have to get closer.

428
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,640
I- Everybody's so far.

429
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,740
I'm trying to snipe, but everyone's so far.

430
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,500
Oh no.

431
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,480
Wait, where am I?

432
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,400
Okay.

433
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,820
I'll play how it's meant to be played.

434
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,080
There you go.

435
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,240
Oh my god.

436
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
Fucking bitches.

437
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Come on.

438
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,740
That's goddamn right.

439
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,560
That's goddamn right.

440
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,960
I guess I'll not frontline.

441
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,260
I miss frontlining, though.

442
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,400
But frontline is so easy.

443
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,530
That's fucking right.

444
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,690
That's right.

445
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,990
I know, I know I shouldn't frontline.

446
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,570
Forget frontline.

447
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,370
That's goddamn right.

448
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,330
My team will be okay.

449
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,030
I believe in him.

450
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,650
I'll just frontline.

451
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,390
Because I believe.

452
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,590
Come on.

453
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,810
Oh my god.

454
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,330
Where are they?

455
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,770
Oh, we should be getting the key.

456
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,790
Oh fuck.

457
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,850
God damn it.

458
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,550
Sorry.

459
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,910
I'm sorry.

460
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,210
I'm fucking around too much.

461
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,270
I don't think he knows.

462
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,650
I don't think he knows.

463
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,610
There's no way he knows.

464
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:52,970
I'm frontlining.

465
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,690
There's no way.

466
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,190
They'll be like, what is this Nurukami doing?

467
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,190
You can't.

468
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,210
You don't understand me.

469
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,410
Here you go.

470
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,190
Oh, he's one.

471
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,980
Oh, I thought I was gonna hit that.

472
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,060
Nice.

473
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,920
Guys, please.

474
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,000
We have to.

475
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,740
Guys, please.

476
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,120
My god, he's one.

477
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,820
No, no.

478
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,680
Yes.

479
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,080
It was worth it.

480
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,580
It was worth it.

481
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,200
It was worth it.

482
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,680
Please.

483
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,220
I'm the sniper.

484
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,800
I'm not meant to do objectives.

485
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm just supposed to shoot.

486
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,780
That's it.

487
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,520
I'm mad.

488
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,800
Come on.

489
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,380
God damn.

490
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,000
He's so fast.

491
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,420
Wait, where's the key?

492
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,720
Please.

493
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,060
That's right.

494
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,220
Here you go.

495
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,600
We got it.

496
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,860
Guys, please.

497
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:54,950
Bye.

498
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:56,870
Oh.

499
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,670
Oh my god.

500
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,230
That was a hit.

501
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,230
That was insane.

502
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,550
Come on.

503
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,130
It's just one shot.

504
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,110
He's one shot.

505
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,450
Please.

506
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,210
Oh, I missed that.

507
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:03,690
Okay, nice.

508
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,950
That's good.

509
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,550
Why are you running?

510
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,650
Why are you running?

511
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:11,990
Okay.

512
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,210
What's the objective now?

513
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,870
I don't know.

514
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,710
I'm just shooting now.

515
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:16,930
Here we go.

516
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,990
Oh.

517
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,990
Ace.

518
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,270
Wait.

519
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,410
Oh, you almost got me.

520
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,050
You almost got me.

521
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,810
I can hear.

522
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,390
That's right.

523
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,570
You almost got me.

524
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,370
But I got ears.

525
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,630
I heard you from behind.

526
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,700
I don't think I need zoom though.

527
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,620
Yeah, he's one hit.

528
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,320
Nice.

529
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,560
I don't think I need zoom.

530
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,880
Oh my god.

531
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,340
Please.

532
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:00,900
That's right.

533
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,780
I have so much free raid.

534
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,980
That's right.

535
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,580
You have three of them here.

536
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,380
They don't lock down.

537
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,900
Look at me.

538
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,880
I'm just chilling.

539
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,400
There we go.

540
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,100
I'm just chilling.

541
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,840
Oh my god.

542
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,260
I love it.

543
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,380
I don't have to worry.

544
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,060
I can just chill.

545
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,520
I'm just gonna have to go here.

546
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,620
I have to find a new sniper perch.

547
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,720
So that people don't come after me.

548
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,620
Oh no.

549
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,720
No, my energy.

550
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,540
Oh no.

551
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,080
I'm stuck.

552
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:53,960
That's good.

553
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,380
That's good.

554
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:57,780
Come on.

555
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,120
No.

556
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,300
Nice.

557
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,780
I got him.

558
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,680
Where is he?

559
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,540
Where is he?

560
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,320
I know you're here.

561
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,700
I think just cause you're flying so fast.

562
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,740
I can't hit you.

563
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,440
You're right.

564
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,960
That's fine.

565
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,980
God dammit.

566
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,460
Nice.

567
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:24,840
It's fine.

568
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,340
I did it.

569
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,660
I still did it.

570
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,400
I still got it.

571
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,940
I still got it.

572
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:29,900
I still got it.

573
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,380
We're fine.

574
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:30,920
We're fine.

575
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,680
Logging in and focus.

576
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
He was right.

577
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,600
Okay, nice.

578
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,840
Nice.

579
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,320
We got it.

580
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,300
Plan.

581
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,980
Whoa.

582
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,740
So easy.

583
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,840
Oh, just cause you're fast?

584
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,040
Look at you, girl.

585
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,240
That's right.

586
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,000
What you gonna do?

587
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,680
I'm gonna send another one in here.

588
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,140
What you gonna do?

589
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:58,800
Huh?

590
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,900
You think you're just gonna get close to me?

591
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,140
Oh, you left.

592
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,440
You're scared.

593
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,760
You're so scared.

594
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,120
Easy.

595
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,860
So easy.

596
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,020
I literally had to.

597
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,200
Oh my God.

598
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,140
That was so free.

599
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,960
That was so fucking free.

600
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,540
Ignoring everything that's not on the objective.

601
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,340
Like...

602
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,720
Legitimately, all I had to do was just stand there.

603
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,620
And...

604
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,240
And just...

605
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, I haven't had a key like that in so long.

606
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,180
Get stopped.

607
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,060
I was an MVP?

608
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,800
What did you do?

609
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,920
What did you do?

610
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,200
What did you do?

611
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,860
Oh my gosh.

612
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,480
Top finisher.

613
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,200
Let's fucking go.

614
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,900
I had the most kill.

615
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,960
What did you do?

616
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,460
Oh, it's cause...

617
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,780
Oh, fucking objective whore.

618
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,260
Like...

619
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,260
Oh.

620
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,460
Oh.

621
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,340
Just cause...

622
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,260
She did...

623
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,880
In a...

624
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,260
Just cause...

625
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,600
She had...

626
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,600
One...

627
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,520
She's a team player.

628
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,620
This is rigged.

629
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,320
This is so...

630
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,200
Rigged.

631
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:07,700
Um.

632
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,220
My kills enabled the team to play the objective.

633
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,120
Um.

634
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,200
What do you mean?

635
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,300
They play the game.

636
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,940
You're shaming them for you.

637
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:18,580
Um.

638
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,160
Because...

639
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,120
I deserve the MVP.

640
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,320
That's all I'm gonna say.

641
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,640
Okay?

642
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,480
I...

643
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,380
All I'm gonna say is that...

644
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,580
Um.

645
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,260
I deserve that MVP.

646
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,100
Um.

647
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,860
She could be an objective player.

648
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,700
But...

649
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,060
Um.

650
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,200
I should get the MVP.

651
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,380
Just cause...

652
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,520
I got the most kills.

653
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,820
I mean...

654
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,460
Caplers don't get MVP.

655
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:43,640
Alright.

656
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,620
Let's do 3-3.

657
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:45,920
Uh.

658
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,500
Alright.

659
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,480
Oh, whoops.

660
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,820
Tactical Station.

661
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,040
Arc Arena.

662
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,020
I think my favorite has to be...

663
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,740
Out of all the characters...

664
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:58,820
Uh.

665
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,740
Wait, there's missions?

666
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,920
I've just been...

667
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,640
There's missions?

668
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,920
I didn't realize there's missions.

669
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,860
Are we talking about...

670
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,500
Operation Storm?

671
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Is that the mission?

672
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,840
Oh.

673
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,720
Is this mission?

674
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,360
What's this?

675
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,580
Neutralize enemies...

676
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:17,760
Is it?

677
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,020
No.

678
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,960
This is the...

679
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,300
This is extraction, right?

680
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,800
Yeah.

681
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,600
This is the extraction mode.

682
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,000
Isn't it?

683
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,560
Yeah.

684
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,880
Is the...

685
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,640
Are missions...

686
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,820
Yeah.

687
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,000
Are missions the...

688
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,960
Extraction mode?

689
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Or do you mean the challenge?

690
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,360
Oh.

691
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:35,980
This one?

692
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,020
No.

693
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,880
I don't need...

694
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Is it this?

695
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,100
Oh.

696
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,720
It's too late.

697
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,700
Hello, everybody.

698
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,480
Look at me.

699
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,320
My kidia...

700
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,360
Kidia is insane.

701
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,520
Alright.

702
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,840
I am...

703
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,020
Oh.

704
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,760
Goddammit.

705
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,740
I wanna play Akula.

706
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,260
Okay.

707
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,360
I am willing...

708
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,640
I am willing...

709
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,260
To play...

710
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,000
Akula...

711
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,220
Uh...

712
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,340
Not...

713
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:04,860
Norukami.

714
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,440
Don't worry.

715
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,540
I am willing to play...

716
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,000
Norukami.

717
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,020
I know...

718
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,140
I know...

719
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,540
You know...

720
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:16,920
You know...

721
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:16,960
You know...

722
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,120
There's...

723
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,980
There's so many other...

724
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,700
I wanted to do...

725
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,600
Norukami...

726
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,440
Or Akula.

727
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,180
I think they were my two mains.

728
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,340
I know like...

729
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,780
You know...

730
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,520
There are 12 different characters.

731
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,760
But like...

732
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,720
Not gonna lie.

733
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,120
Yeah...

734
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,080
There's 12 of them.

735
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,020
But for me...

736
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,740
There's only two fun ones for me.

737
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,340
Because I am not a masochist to play tank.

738
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,280
And...

739
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,780
I play support like...

740
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,400
Twice.

741
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,500
And...

742
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,080
And...

743
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,860
Never again.

744
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,020
When I played support...

745
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,720
Um...

746
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,940
When I played support that one time...

747
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,880
And then...

748
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,340
Like...

749
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,360
Legitimately...

750
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,280
It was just like...

751
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,940
Hunting a rabbit right there.

752
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:55,900
Uh...

753
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,580
It was not a good time for me.

754
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,480
Yeah, I'm having like...

755
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,120
PTSD thinking about it.

756
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,620
It was...

757
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,100
It was...

758
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,500
It was very rough.

759
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,600
It was...

760
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,740
It was very, very rough.

761
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,000
I don't understand why you would put yourself through that.

762
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,700
Unless you're also a masochist.

763
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,320
I feel like it's only fun when you're in high elo.

764
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,560
Destroy all enemy units.

765
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,240
Cause like...

766
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,760
For me...

767
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,560
That shit was so fucking hard.

768
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,440
Holy shit.

769
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,300
What the fu- OH SHIT!

770
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,220
OH MY GOD!

771
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:38,760
YOU

772
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,600
FUCKING SHOOTING THERE NURUKAMI!

773
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,480
Oh yeah!

774
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,120
Yeah!

775
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,100
I really have a panther on my ass right now.

776
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:01,860
Like...

777
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,520
What was I supposed to do?

778
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,590
Oh, this guy.

779
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,830
Okay, like...

780
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,970
That's fucked up.

781
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,350
I literally had a panther on my ass.

782
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,250
Like, what the fuck?

783
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,190
Enter...

784
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,890
Oh my god!

785
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,530
I'm getting hunted.

786
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,190
I'm getting hunted by there.

787
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,770
That's fucking right.

788
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,070
It's not as fun too, right?

789
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,650
Not as fun, right?

790
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,370
Oh, that's right, NURUKAMI!

791
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,470
That's not fun, right?

792
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,510
Yeah, it better not be fun.

793
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,430
Yeah, I know.

794
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,570
It's not fun at all.

795
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,790
Oh my god.

796
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,790
Oh my god.

797
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,870
Oh, this is so rough.

798
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:55,950
Oh my god.

799
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:56,270
Guys.

800
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:56,990
Guys.

801
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:57,890
Okay.

802
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,430
Okay, guys.

803
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,070
I need help.

804
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,510
OH MY GOD!

805
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,400
You're following me!

806
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,720
Oh, I'm getting NURUKAMI dipped so high.

807
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,180
I'm getting...

808
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,120
Bro, I'm getting NURUKAMI dipped at the moment.

809
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,180
This guy is...

810
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,820
I'm just a baby NURUKAMI.

811
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,680
This guy's been playing NURUKAMI his entire life since launch.

812
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,400
He's been playing since goddamn launch.

813
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,620
Like, I don't know.

814
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,160
I don't know, guys.

815
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,460
I'm trying my best to help.

816
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,920
Like, I have to be, like, so aware.

817
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,300
Right now.

818
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,180
Because of this stupid other NURUKAMI.

819
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Jesus Christ.

820
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,720
Like, legitimately.

821
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,540
Oh my god.

822
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,040
That's right!

823
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,520
Revenge!

824
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,800
Revenge, bitch!

825
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,740
Revenge!

826
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,120
Revenge!

827
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,960
Oh my god.

828
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,880
I actually have to, like, run around all...

829
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,560
Like, I can't stay standstill for this.

830
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,300
I just noticed.

831
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,980
I legitimately cannot standstill.

832
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,000
Like, I have to, like, move around so much.

833
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,020
Okay.

834
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,440
Okay.

835
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:26,480
Okay.

836
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,300
You got what you deserve.

837
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,340
I actually cannot move.

838
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,660
I cannot, like, standstill.

839
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:31,980
Woken.

840
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,300
Ready to pick off some stragglers.

841
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,220
Jesus Christ!

842
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,480
Oh my god!

843
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,210
No!

844
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,630
I literally...

845
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,090
The one time...

846
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:51,730
Like, when...

847
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,290
I have to, like...

848
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,850
Every time I standstill, I'm dead.

849
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,870
Every time...

850
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,430
I got hunted down so high.

851
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,750
Legitally.

852
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:00,430
Oh my...

853
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,110
Okay, we gotta do another NURUKAMI game.

854
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,090
I can't...

855
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,110
We can't do this.

856
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,310
This guy's been playing NURUKAMI since launch.

857
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,030
He's cracked the system.

858
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,030
He's...

859
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,250
He's cracked it.

860
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,290
Holy fuck.

861
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,590
Legit...

862
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:14,630
Legit...

863
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,410
I sit still...

864
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,190
I get shot at.

865
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,030
I...

866
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,730
Yeah.

867
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,650
I just...

868
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,710
I had to keep moving.

869
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,510
I kept...

870
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,270
When I kept moving, I...

871
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,390
I was actually alive.

872
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,910
I was alive for more than five seconds.

873
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,650
It's crazy.

874
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,610
Oh my god.

875
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,590
Is that not...

876
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,010
I like NURUKAMI more.

877
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:41,970
Alright.

878
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,510
That's it.

879
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:44,790
A kitten.

880
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,870
Don't worry.

881
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,470
Wait, what?

882
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,470
Bitch!

883
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,930
Get off her!

884
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,290
Get off NURUKAMI right now!

885
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,250
What do you mean?

886
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,430
Get off of her!

887
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,410
I hate you.

888
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,650
I hate you.

889
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,390
Come on.

890
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,770
She hasn't locked in yet.

891
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,730
It's not fair!

892
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,650
If they haven't locked in yet, I should be allowed to lock in.

893
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,250
Like, that should be the thing.

894
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,890
If they haven't locked the character in, I should be able to steal it.

895
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,470
Yes, that's fucking right.

896
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,690
That's right!

897
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,030
That's right!

898
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,630
Know your place!

899
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,950
Yeah, the fastest fingers should win.

900
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,610
Hahaha!

901
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,380
That's goddamn right.

902
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:38,880
That's right!

903
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,800
Know your place, Ray!

904
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,760
Can't believe you tried to take NURUKAMI from me.

905
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,220
Know your place!

906
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,580
Blue button!

907
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,960
Thank you for the...

908
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,340
Twitch Prime!

909
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,660
Thank you!

910
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,280
Thank you!

911
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:55,600
Yeah!

912
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,900
Get off of NURUKAMI now or I throw!

913
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:58,760
Hahaha!

914
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,260
You notice people?

915
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,060
It's like...

916
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,600
Give me...

917
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,920
Give me X character or I'll throw.

918
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,640
And they were serious.

919
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,900
And I was too.

920
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,160
Hahaha!

921
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,560
Don't make...

922
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,580
Don't call my bluff.

923
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,960
Trying to call my bluff.

924
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,220
The classic.

925
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,380
Give NURUKAMI or I throw.

926
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,740
Exactly.

927
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,420
Oh!

928
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,860
He was shooting the...

929
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,100
He was shooting me there too.

930
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,460
That's crazy.

931
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,300
I saw it.

932
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,190
Oh my god!

933
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,660
He doesn't know.

934
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,520
He doesn't know.

935
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,120
Okay.

936
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,740
Alright.

937
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
I have to...

938
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,560
Wait until I have more camo.

939
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,920
Okay.

940
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,880
Oh my god.

941
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,120
That panther wants me dead.

942
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,660
I can tell.

943
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,010
Ooh.

944
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:24,870
That's right!

945
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,550
I'm better!

946
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,510
Oh!

947
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,480
I don't think he knows I'm here.

948
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,660
Hahaha!

949
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
That's why you lost it!

950
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,360
I was right behind you this entire time!

951
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,110
Oh my god.

952
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,430
JK, I was right behind you this entire time and you didn't know.

953
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,630
Oh my god.

954
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,030
Oh my god.

955
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,150
He shot on my decoys too.

956
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,250
There we go.

957
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,090
I helped.

958
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,350
Woo!

959
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:11,570
Hahaha!

960
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,630
I know he wanted to shoot me too.

961
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,270
Woo!

962
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,810
I think this was the real one right?

963
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,530
No he's not.

964
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,070
Oh he is the real one.

965
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,920
What was that?

966
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,660
What was that?

967
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,320
What was that?

968
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,000
He was the real one too!

969
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,180
Okay.

970
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,180
There we go.

971
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,620
He's so confused.

972
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,380
Look at him.

973
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,260
He's so confused.

974
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:48,900
Hahaha!

975
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,460
I think after like what happened to me there.

976
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,680
I don't think he knows.

977
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:56,940
Yeah.

978
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,400
I think what happened to me during that last fight with the other Nurukami.

979
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,460
The game balanced me.

980
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,500
And was like you don't deserve that here.

981
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:04,980
Let me.

982
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:05,820
Hahaha!

983
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,680
Oh shit!

984
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,740
The game told me I didn't deserve that.

985
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,740
So they were- they got nicer to me.

986
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,800
Thanks guys.

987
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,020
I can't.

988
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,700
I can't see.

989
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,820
The game actually got nice to me.

990
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,700
Woo!

991
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,560
I don't think they know I'm here.

992
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,040
Woo!

993
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,020
Hahaha!

994
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:37,950
Hahaha!

995
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,390
Hahaha!

996
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,480
Hahaha!

997
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,940
You were safe!

998
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,720
Oh no!

999
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,880
Oh no!

1000
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,440
Oh no!

1001
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,320
I can't see!

1002
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,980
I was trying to run around!

1003
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,160
Trying to get out of it!

1004
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,000
I couldn't see!

1005
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,900
Run away!

1006
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,800
I couldn't see!

1007
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,820
I couldn't see!

1008
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,720
I couldn't see!

1009
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,280
I couldn't see!

1010
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,020
I couldn't see!

1011
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,720
It was so hard to see!

1012
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,680
I don't know where- how to get out of the storm!

1013
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,100
Storm!

1014
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,360
Haha!

1015
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,200
Storm!

1016
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,200
It hurts!

1017
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,320
Okay.

1018
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,140
I'm okay now.

1019
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,720
I'm okay now.

1020
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,320
Oh.

1021
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,480
I see her though.

1022
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,820
Oh.

1023
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,760
It's fine.

1024
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,440
The guy just falsely me!

1025
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,700
Ahaha!

1026
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,740
That's right!

1027
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,220
Yeah!

1028
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,120
Catch me!

1029
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,600
That's good.

1030
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,640
That Nagakami knows how I felt!

1031
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,380
The Nagakami knows exactly how I felt!

1032
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,560
When I kept getting chased by their panther.

1033
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,580
No fun allowed.

1034
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,960
That's right.

1035
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,180
That's right.

1036
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,200
Thank God SBMM balanced me back down.

1037
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,100
Fighting Narcami as hell.

1038
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,780
That's right.

1039
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,500
Easy win.

1040
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,900
Oh, I deserve that.

1041
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,040
I fucking deserve that.

1042
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,820
I got seven of the kills.

1043
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,640
Let's go.

1044
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,140
That's right.

1045
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,200
And they try to take my Narcami.

1046
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,180
I lost.

1047
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,400
I lost.

1048
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:39,800
Sorry.

1049
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,220
There's no way.

1050
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,360
There's no way.

1051
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,240
Alright, let's check his info.

1052
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,420
There's no way.

1053
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:45,680
See?

1054
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,960
Bro, what?

1055
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,080
Okay,

1056
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,200
wait.

1057
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Okay, wait.

1058
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,520
Let me check your Narcami.

1059
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,780
Let me... Okay, that makes very sense.

1060
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,560
1.1.

1061
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,500
Like, bro!

1062
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,100
I have 1.6 hours.

1063
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,400
I'm, like, just a little bit more than you.

1064
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,520
Bro, 5.2?

1065
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,880
Dude has to stop.

1066
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,700
That's sad.

1067
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,400
That's... Oh, my God.

1068
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,620
I got perfect 10-0.

1069
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,300
Let's go.

1070
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:41,480
The first guy was Grandmastered.

1071
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,340
Nice.

1072
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,200
That's right.

1073
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,420
For whoever said they had to be bots.

1074
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:46,800
No.

1075
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,900
They...

1076
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,080
You know, this guy... Stop.

1077
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,920
Stop fighting!

1078
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,660
I got perfect KDA right there.

1079
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,920
GM3.

1080
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,820
Look at that.

1081
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,880
I literally beat a GM.

1082
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Look, as a Bronze 1 player, I literally beat a GM3.

1083
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,140
I'm practically GM3 right now.

1084
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,760
I'm, I'm...

1085
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,160
This is more about them than about you.

1086
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,220
Ace Arena is a different rank.

1087
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,280
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

1088
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,500
It's still, like...

1089
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,820
It's still, like, a shooter type game.

1090
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,840
That's the thing- It's, like, it's still, like, a similar mode to...

1091
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,860
Um, to 6v6.

1092
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,440
It's just it's three people instead.

1093
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,940
And then it's...

1094
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,800
What do you mean?

1095
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,500
I play like two hours every time!

1096
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,720
I told you guys, ever since...

1097
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,240
Ever since I got mouse acceleration off, I'm a different person now.

1098
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,720
I'm actually gaming now.

1099
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,800
Alright, let's swap to Alyssa.

1100
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,300
I like Alyssa.

1101
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,520
I'm not gonna do the falcon.

1102
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,460
Falcon was so fucking dumb.

1103
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm not doing falcon.

1104
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,840
Falcon was actually...

1105
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,540
I felt like I was shooting peas at people.

1106
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Alright.

1107
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:13,920
Aquila!

1108
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,560
Aquila!

1109
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,580
Alright.

1110
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:18,900
I wanna do...

1111
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,760
Aquila!

1112
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,580
Aquila!

1113
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,260
I like Aquila.

1114
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,240
She's fine.

1115
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,620
I am a falcon main though.

1116
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,780
I'm sorry.

1117
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,040
I don't know how you...

1118
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,640
I don't know how you exist.

1119
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,740
I don't know.

1120
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,440
It feels like she does like barely any damage.

1121
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,880
And like also has so low HP.

1122
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,280
His HP is so fucking low.

1123
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,260
And with so little...

1124
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,220
With so little damage in general.

1125
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,500
I literally just fly around and annoy people.

1126
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,920
I'm just like...

1127
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm just there to harass everyone.

1128
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,000
Oh, there's two...

1129
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,780
Aquila players.

1130
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,680
There's one Aquila player.

1131
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,360
JK.

1132
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,300
There's actually one.

1133
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,040
Alright.

1134
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,140
Alright.

1135
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,220
Alright.

1136
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,240
We'll do...

1137
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,780
I think I can have time for like...

1138
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,410
One to two more...

1139
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:30,440
Uh...

1140
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,480
Random lobby matches.

1141
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,260
And then we'll do custom lobbies after that.

1142
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,300
But yeah, you guys wanna have a chance to play with me!

1143
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:35,860
Later!

1144
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,700
In about like 20 minutes!

1145
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,580
I'll be doing an hour of custom lobbies.

1146
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,700
So, um...

1147
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,540
Um...

1148
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,260
So, yes.

1149
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,920
You can download the game right now.

1150
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,740
That's pinned on my chat.

1151
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,500
Uh...

1152
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,340
Or do exclamation point mecha break.

1153
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,420
And you can download the game right now for free.

1154
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,880
It is a free to play too.

1155
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,200
So, uh...

1156
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,680
You don't have to pay anything extra.

1157
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,820
Yay!

1158
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,780
I love free stuff.

1159
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,380
Alright.

1160
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,060
I'm ready.

1161
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,340
Pilot's ready.

1162
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,260
Alright.

1163
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,740
Here we go.

1164
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,580
If we...

1165
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,100
No way.

1166
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,280
Everything comes with a price.

1167
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,740
That's right.

1168
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,240
Losing to me is the price.

1169
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,640
Alright.

1170
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,680
Oh my god.

1171
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,760
It's objective again.

1172
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,340
Oh my god.

1173
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,360
Everyone loves Narakami.

1174
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,640
I mean, she's so fun to play.

1175
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,320
Narakami is actually so fucking fun to play.

1176
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,640
I feel like Panther is for the people who like melee.

1177
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,720
And then...

1178
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,920
Narakami is the people who like DPS.

1179
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,020
Uh...

1180
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,540
Seize control.

1181
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,580
Be the first to complete.

1182
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:53,900
Okay.

1183
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:54,940
So it's just like...

1184
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,220
Whoever has all three objectives.

1185
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:57,960
The longest.

1186
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,040
I guess.

1187
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,200
Aquila!

1188
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,420
Ready to provide aerial cover.

1189
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,200
Aquila!

1190
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,280
That's me!

1191
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,020
Try Panther.

1192
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:07,560
Left stat.

1193
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,220
That was me too.

1194
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,080
I just...

1195
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,700
My brain doesn't know how...

1196
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,160
Melee works in general.

1197
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:13,820
Honestly.

1198
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,560
What was...

1199
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,860
My abilities again?

1200
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,580
I know this.

1201
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,220
Okay.

1202
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,250
Oh, it's the falcon.

1203
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:25,630
Yeah, no.

1204
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,370
This guy's fucked.

1205
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:36,690
Yeah, no.

1206
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:37,270
He's...

1207
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,350
He's not gonna be playing the game.

1208
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,190
I know it.

1209
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,630
I mean...

1210
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,130
He was...

1211
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,130
Very brave.

1212
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,530
Very, very brave of him.

1213
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,490
For him.

1214
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,250
Knock into that.

1215
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,830
Wait, where's the objective?

1216
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:06,150
Okay.

1217
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,250
It's only objective.

1218
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,470
Okay, we gotta get A.

1219
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,010
What the fuck do you mean?

1220
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,030
Our team hasn't grabbed a point yet!

1221
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,550
Are you serious?

1222
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,590
Oh my god.

1223
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,070
My team.

1224
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:19,850
Please.

1225
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:20,770
Team.

1226
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:24,830
Are you serious?

1227
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,150
My team hasn't grabbed a single point yet.

1228
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:27,910
I...

1229
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,970
I'm so sad.

1230
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,670
Please!

1231
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:33,710
What have you...

1232
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:34,590
What have my team been doing?

1233
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:35,090
Oh!

1234
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,830
I can't believe it.

1235
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:41,010
What has my...

1236
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:41,890
Oh my god.

1237
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,230
My team has just been fighting.

1238
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,510
We don't care.

1239
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:46,910
Oh my god.

1240
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:47,550
It's...

1241
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:47,890
It's a...

1242
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,750
My team's a...

1243
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,950
My team's a frag team.

1244
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:51,990
My team's a frag team.

1245
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,580
Oh, they're a frag team.

1246
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,340
They don't care.

1247
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,480
They don't care.

1248
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,660
You got what you deserve.

1249
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,780
They just wanna frag.

1250
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,860
It's understandable.

1251
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,520
Me too.

1252
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,760
Me too.

1253
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,880
Me too.

1254
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,800
That's what I wanna do too.

1255
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,220
Oh!

1256
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,900
Mobility kit activated.

1257
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:16,500
Oh my god.

1258
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,120
I'm so low.

1259
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,340
Where's my healers?

1260
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:18,900
Where's Lumine?

1261
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,260
Where the fuck is Lumine?

1262
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,760
Oh my god.

1263
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,200
My team is just full of fragers.

1264
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,720
Please.

1265
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:30,800
Please.

1266
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,140
Oh my god.

1267
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:31,560
Please no.

1268
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,060
Oh my god.

1269
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:33,680
I thought...

1270
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,580
I thought I had more people here.

1271
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,460
But I guess not.

1272
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:37,460
I lied.

1273
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,780
Oh no.

1274
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:40,400
I'm so dead.

1275
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,040
I'm so dead.

1276
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,340
At least I'm fragging.

1277
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,680
At least I'm fragging.

1278
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:46,880
At least I'm fragging, okay.

1279
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,760
At least I'm fragging.

1280
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,960
That's all I...

1281
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,040
at least I'm fragging, guys.

1282
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm still alive.

1283
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,580
I'm a believer.

1284
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,460
Okay.

1285
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,060
How?

1286
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:10,940
How?

1287
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,360
Where's my team?

1288
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,580
Oh, this is not fair.

1289
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,220
I don't have... I don't have the heals for this.

1290
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,160
I actually don't have the heals to do this match.

1291
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,260
I... Team, please!

1292
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,920
We don't all have to be at A!

1293
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:33,840
Team!

1294
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:33,840
Please!

1295
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,940
We actually don't all have to be at A!

1296
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,900
Team!

1297
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,380
Oh, I'm dead.

1298
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,460
You know what?

1299
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,900
I'd rather just die, honestly.

1300
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,200
So I can come back with full HP.

1301
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:54,840
Nice.

1302
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:59,650
Okay, that's good.

1303
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:02,930
Oh, that's not good.

1304
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,750
Oh, that's not good.

1305
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:08,750
Oh, my God.

1306
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,010
I think I hit him.

1307
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:13,710
That's good.

1308
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:17,270
Oh, nice.

1309
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:18,770
Oh, not nice.

1310
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:19,950
Oh, not nice.

1311
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:22,710
Oh, my God.

1312
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,070
Not nice.

1313
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:27,480
Okay.

1314
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,580
Please, I'm shooting him as much as I can.

1315
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,120
Okay, nice.

1316
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:39,560
I got him.

1317
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,980
Are you serious?

1318
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,780
Please, somebody kill her!

1319
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:50,490
Oh, my God.

1320
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:50,990
She dead?

1321
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:51,910
Is she dead?

1322
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:52,830
Oh, thank God.

1323
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,270
How am I still?

1324
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,270
I don't know.

1325
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,430
Where's Luminae?

1326
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,810
Luminae walked away!

1327
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:02,630
Oh, my God.

1328
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,310
She was there, too.

1329
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,890
That's the worst part.

1330
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:10,410
Luminae was in that fight with me.

1331
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,770
And she just walked away.

1332
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:19,150
Okay, that's so fucked up.

1333
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,220
Oh, my God.

1334
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,360
That's the worst part.

1335
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,740
When, like, she was there.

1336
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,370
The fact that Luminae was there.

1337
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,650
Luminae, please.

1338
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,630
I know you're still here, Luminae.

1339
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:49,710
I know.

1340
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,160
Okay.

1341
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,980
I can't fly.

1342
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,760
I'm not okay right now.

1343
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,280
Where's Luminae?

1344
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,460
Luminae, where are you?

1345
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,660
Oh, my God, please.

1346
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,820
Where is she?

1347
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,200
Oh, my God, where are you?

1348
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,120
Oh, my God.

1349
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,620
Where is Luminae?

1350
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:27,150
I don't know how that... It's been so long.

1351
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,470
Since I felt the touch of a robot.

1352
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,690
It's been so long.

1353
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,610
Holy shit, it really has been.

1354
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,770
So very nice.

1355
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,110
Since a robot has touched me like that.

1356
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,590
What the fuck?

1357
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,010
What?

1358
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,610
What?

1359
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:10,550
What?

1360
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,850
I'm...

1361
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,810
That guy...

1362
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:17,750
Fight back.

1363
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:21,070
Okay?

1364
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,050
He didn't fight back.

1365
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,450
I was like, what?

1366
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:27,430
Oh my god.

1367
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:28,470
Wait a minute.

1368
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:29,450
I'm not.

1369
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:29,790
Wait.

1370
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:30,970
Wait.

1371
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:31,570
Guys, help.

1372
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,310
Wait.

1373
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:33,730
Guys.

1374
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:35,790
Guys, please.

1375
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,010
I can't do this.

1376
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:41,610
I need someone to capture B for me.

1377
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:47,740
Please.

1378
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,350
Oh my god.

1379
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,150
I don't know what to do.

1380
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,250
Oh, we just win.

1381
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:56,830
That's okay.

1382
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,190
He's just chilling.

1383
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,990
He just... He just wanted to capture.

1384
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,310
I'm surprised we won.

1385
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:04,610
Oh my god.

1386
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:06,770
That started off really bad at first.

1387
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,030
Not gonna lie.

1388
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,350
We, like, locked in at the last second.

1389
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:12,990
Thank god.

1390
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,230
Thank god.

1391
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,510
We actually locked in.

1392
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:19,730
What is that?

1393
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,110
Lumine can't patch up.

1394
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:22,710
Lumine!

1395
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,450
What does she do?

1396
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,030
I was like... There's no fucking way.

1397
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,930
What does she do?

1398
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,290
What do you mean?

1399
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,890
What does she do?

1400
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:44,910
What does she do?

1401
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:45,330
What does she do?

1402
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:45,550
Oh yeah.

1403
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:46,650
She healed me.

1404
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,030
Yeah.

1405
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:53,670
That... Well, thank you for healing me for 100 HP out of that 172,000.

1406
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:59,010
They did more than... The fuck is this?

1407
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,110
King, thank you with a Twitch friend.

1408
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:01,990
Thank you.

1409
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,270
Well, you lived.

1410
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:03,610
Yeah.

1411
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,550
What do you mean?

1412
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:08,190
I was fucking... I was fucking... I was fucking fighting for my life.

1413
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,910
The entire time.

1414
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,710
Lumine carried you.

1415
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:14,290
Oh my god.

1416
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,930
I was fucking fighting to live.

1417
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:19,210
What the fuck does he mean?

1418
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:21,930
Oh my god.

1419
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:26,270
The one time I got MPP was the Nur... Nurukami match.

1420
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:27,750
Alright, what time is it?

1421
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:30,070
Okay, we have... I can sneak one more in.

1422
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:39,170
Alright, I'm gonna do... I'm gonna do another... Arena for... Aquila.

1423
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,410
Aquila this time.

1424
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:47,690
Alright, what I do... The first custom lobby... I wanna do... 6v6.

1425
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,790
6v6.

1426
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,910
All Nurukami.

1427
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:57,810
6v6.

1428
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,710
All Nurukami.

1429
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:01,630
I wanna know what that's like.

1430
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,550
Can you do... Yes, you can.

1431
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:05,790
You can have all...

1432
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,430
Uh...

1433
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,610
Uh, you can have all of the... Like, the same character.

1434
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,150
Yeah, that's possible.

1435
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,730
We did that with all Falcons.

1436
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,490
It was like... It was...

1437
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,510
Wait, is it... Can we do... Actually, can we do that in...

1438
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:19,430
Uh, 6v6?

1439
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,750
Or is it only 3v3?

1440
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,170
Or is it only, like, 3v3 that we can do that?

1441
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,390
Pilot proceeding...

1442
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,950
I forgot... I forgot it was like locked in deathmatch only.

1443
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:34,950
No dupes actually... No!

1444
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,870
They took away dupes!

1445
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,610
Oh, that was fun now.

1446
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,730
That was so fun though when we did the...

1447
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:47,630
When we did the... 3v3 all Falcons.

1448
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,710
Okay, we'll check match settings to see if we can do dupes.

1449
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,070
We'll check it.

1450
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:57,070
Because if we can, I wanna make it all Nurukami.

1451
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,750
No, all Falcons was held.

1452
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:01,730
That was like...

1453
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,390
That was so hard.

1454
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:08,670
It's like, oops.

1455
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:09,770
Um...

1456
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:10,230
Aquila!

1457
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:12,270
Oh my god, not this map.

1458
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:13,690
Not this map.

1459
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,210
Oh my god.

1460
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:17,870
Oh my god, no.

1461
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:19,770
They have Nurukami too.

1462
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,240
Wait, what?

1463
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,980
They're not locked?

1464
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,360
Oh, shit.

1465
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,480
That's so weird.

1466
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,880
Oh, maybe because he was moving so fast.

1467
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,120
I was gonna say, did I not lock?

1468
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:48,010
Very nice.

1469
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,890
Oh my god, where was it?

1470
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:53,970
Okay.

1471
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:56,810
Nice.

1472
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:58,910
That's right.

1473
00:57:59,090 --> 00:57:59,790
Oh, shit.

1474
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:00,550
That's not right.

1475
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,890
Oh, that's so scary when he does the...

1476
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:04,930
The second life shit.

1477
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:07,070
Second life is so scary.

1478
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,240
Okay.

1479
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:13,960
Nice.

1480
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,800
Oh, I got you.

1481
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,080
That's right.

1482
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,520
That's right.

1483
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,820
Oh, I got you too.

1484
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,800
First blood.

1485
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,100
I can tank it.

1486
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,480
You know what?

1487
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:35,740
Get him.

1488
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,080
Oh, I was gonna do an execute.

1489
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,320
I knew I could tank it too.

1490
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,020
That's the thing.

1491
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,160
That's why I went for it.

1492
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,040
Oh, shit.

1493
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:42,520
I don't know.

1494
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,220
I can tank it again.

1495
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:43,560
No.

1496
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,540
Oh, wait.

1497
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,200
Did he get hit?

1498
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:50,900
Did he get hit?

1499
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,560
The Falcon get hit by it.

1500
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:53,860
Wait, where is he?

1501
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:54,880
Oh, he's dead!

1502
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,040
He's dead!

1503
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,380
Idiot!

1504
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,260
Here he comes.

1505
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,740
I like pay attention to that map so much.

1506
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,360
Like, I'm like so paranoid about the map.

1507
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,460
Oh, he thinks I didn't see him.

1508
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,840
I saw that little speck moving over there.

1509
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,900
You think I didn't see you?

1510
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,140
Oh, ho, ho.

1511
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:14,840
You think I didn't see you?

1512
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,040
Yeah, Falcon, run.

1513
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,980
Fly directly into...

1514
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:18,400
You know what?

1515
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:18,900
That's right.

1516
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,640
Get executed.

1517
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,880
Fly directly into my scope, you idiot.

1518
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,980
Get out of here.

1519
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,080
Oh.

1520
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,040
Get your ass out of here.

1521
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:32,760
Two more.

1522
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,380
Two more.

1523
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,760
Might as well give up now.

1524
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:37,760
Oh, ho, ho.

1525
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,760
That's okay, right?

1526
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,220
Where'd he go?

1527
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,860
Where'd he go?

1528
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,740
Oh, we win anyway.

1529
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,700
No kills for you.

1530
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,180
Look at that.

1531
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,660
Fast game.

1532
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,160
Wait, one kill?

1533
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,480
Who the fuck did you kill?

1534
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,540
Because it wasn't me.

1535
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,280
That's right.

1536
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,420
That's me.

1537
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,120
Aquila.

1538
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,500
That's me.

1539
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,000
I think I'm pretty decent.

1540
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,700
3v3.

1541
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,140
Aquila.

1542
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,600
Who's the one guy that died?

1543
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,380
Who is it?

1544
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:20,860
This guy?

1545
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:21,640
Looney Bus?

1546
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,420
What is he doing?

1547
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,360
What the fuck was Looney Bus doing here?

1548
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,240
Nice.

1549
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:30,600
All right.

1550
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,160
Time to do custom lobby, guys.

1551
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:33,960
All right.

1552
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:34,720
Yay!

1553
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,500
I'm so bronze.

1554
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,040
How do I get out of bronze?

1555
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,200
Oh, no.

1556
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,680
I'm heart-suck bronze.

1557
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,080
Oh.

1558
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:42,740
Oh.

1559
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:43,380
Oh.

1560
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,380
All right.

1561
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,760
I can't believe it.

1562
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,300
Your Oshi is heart-stuck bronze in this game.

1563
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,140
All right.

1564
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,420
We'll do a random map here.

1565
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,080
And I'm going to try and see what we can do.

1566
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,720
Modify squad.

1567
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,080
Oh, is it here?

1568
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,740
Oh, no.

1569
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,980
Oh, no restriction.

1570
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:02,700
Oh, yes.

1571
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,240
There you go.

1572
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:04,560
Oh, Narukami.

1573
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:05,620
Guys.

1574
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,620
Oh, Narukami.

1575
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:09,540
Oh.

1576
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,420
I want all of it.

1577
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:21,780
Oh, wait.

1578
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,380
Insufficient.

1579
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:23,820
Insufficient?

1580
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,220
There you go.

1581
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:26,460
All right.

1582
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,840
I swear to God.

1583
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,180
If you're not Narukami, I'm kicking you.

1584
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,280
All right.

1585
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,720
Uh-oh.

1586
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,620
All snipers.

1587
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,260
What do we do?

1588
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,220
All right, guys.

1589
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,620
Everybody.

1590
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:42,700
Narukami.

1591
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:43,920
Ready to strike.

1592
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,420
Narukami.

1593
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,780
Ready to strike.

1594
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,280
Narukami.

1595
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,580
Ready to strike.

1596
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,940
I can't believe there's one person in our squad that actually has a guy as the pilot.

1597
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,940
Are we all ready to strike, guys?

1598
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,360
Ready to strike.

1599
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:08,300
This is going to be a light jump.

1600
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:09,440
All right.

1601
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:10,760
Also, guys.

1602
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:18,400
To make it fair for everyone, if you have played in the custom lobbies, let other dragons have a chance to join.

1603
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,600
I don't want to play.

1604
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,120
What's wrong with that?

1605
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,440
We have a DC?

1606
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,040
Oh, that sucks.

1607
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:25,680
Oh, that sucks.

1608
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,160
Sucks for you.

1609
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,660
Narukami.

1610
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,960
Ready to strike.

1611
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,100
All right.

1612
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,640
Ready.

1613
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,240
We're all ready.

1614
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:49,920
Let's try Sarah's.

1615
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,100
Let's try Sarah the tank.

1616
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:57,690
Oh, my God.

1617
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:58,650
Nothing will die.

1618
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:00,670
Nothing will die.

1619
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:04,950
All right.

1620
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:05,410
Here we go.

1621
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,070
Okay.

1622
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:08,670
We all have to work together, guys.

1623
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,750
We all have to.

1624
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:14,090
Thank God it wasn't the deathmatch version.

1625
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,730
Because I feel like that would be so fast.

1626
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:22,170
Who has a falcon?

1627
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:22,450
Okay.

1628
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,250
We all gunned down the falcon, guys.

1629
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:28,850
Okay.

1630
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:33,850
When we see, when we see the falcon, we all gunned him down.

1631
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,730
He's not gonna live.

1632
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,410
Guys, he's not gonna live.

1633
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,250
When we gunned down the falcon together.

1634
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:45,370
We're shooting him on sight.

1635
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:46,870
Doesn't matter.

1636
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,550
We shoot the falcon on sight, okay?

1637
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,330
Where is he?

1638
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:57,210
He has to show himself.

1639
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:06,010
He has to delete it so fast.

1640
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,230
That's crazy.

1641
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:15,610
Oh, my God.

1642
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,510
That's actually crazy.

1643
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,890
Oh, my God.

1644
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,780
Holy shit.

1645
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,400
Holy fuck.

1646
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,580
Oh, my God.

1647
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,680
Where could we be?

1648
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,720
We're not stand still.

1649
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,120
We got point A, though.

1650
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,260
They can't breach the wall.

1651
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,760
We have snipers lined up.

1652
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,820
They can't breach the wall.

1653
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,060
What do they do?

1654
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,440
What do they...

1655
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,080
We can't stand still.

1656
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,020
We stand still.

1657
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:56,500
We're fucked.

1658
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:57,980
Oh, my God.

1659
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,260
There's a guy right here.

1660
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,740
I see you.

1661
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,500
I see you.

1662
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,440
You're trying to hide.

1663
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,440
I don't see you.

1664
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,140
Where did he go?

1665
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,220
Oh, shit.

1666
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,180
Oh, my God.

1667
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,180
That scared me.

1668
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,800
I know he's a rap.

1669
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,580
Oh, I see you.

1670
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,880
I see you.

1671
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,920
You're trying to hide.

1672
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:25,600
What?

1673
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,120
That's...

1674
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,240
That's so scary.

1675
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:30,600
Holy shit.

1676
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,220
I got B, though.

1677
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,880
Narukami, you're ready to strike.

1678
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,180
Don't worry.

1679
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,280
I'm defending it.

1680
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,120
Oh, I have to be next to it.

1681
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:43,380
Whoops.

1682
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:44,040
Never mind.

1683
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,620
Now I'm defending it.

1684
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,040
Oh, my God.

1685
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,100
That's crazy.

1686
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,720
The second sniper point.

1687
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,640
Holy shit.

1688
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:56,220
Okay.

1689
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,540
The instant kill was fucking insane.

1690
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,160
Because we had, like, three people aiming there.

1691
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,200
Oh.

1692
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:10,460
Whoops.

1693
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,440
That wasn't it.

1694
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:14,600
Don't worry.

1695
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,220
They don't know.

1696
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,060
Oh, they don't.

1697
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:19,360
They know.

1698
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:19,760
They know.

1699
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:20,500
They know.

1700
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,580
Oh, my God.

1701
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,620
They don't.

1702
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,940
They're all aiming for it.

1703
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,220
They know.

1704
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:31,740
Oh, my God.

1705
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,920
Oh, my God.

1706
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:38,720
Oh.

1707
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,820
Oh, shit.

1708
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:43,860
Oh, shit.

1709
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,160
It's the fight of the sniper.

1710
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,480
We're all dancing around.

1711
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,860
Oh, shit.

1712
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:47,880
What?

1713
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:49,560
Doesn't know.

1714
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,420
I'm just an empty baby spider.

1715
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,980
Baby, baby, spider.

1716
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,280
Oh.

1717
01:06:59,540 --> 01:06:59,820
Oh.

1718
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,480
No no no no.

1719
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,200
Never expected me.

1720
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,760
They never expected me.

1721
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,380
No it's not.

1722
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:13,840
Okay.

1723
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,460
Alright, we gotta get B now.

1724
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,700
I made it.

1725
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,400
I don't know how.

1726
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,600
This is, this is crazy.

1727
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,360
This is- it is actually such a crazy game.

1728
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,440
It's just- oops all snipers.

1729
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,370
There it is.

1730
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:42,110
I was like, yay!

1731
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,450
Alright, where did he shoot me from?

1732
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:50,510
Look at me very slowly, just flying up.

1733
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:55,190
He is the target in the world.

1734
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:01,110
Oh my god.

1735
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:04,130
That was such an easy target.

1736
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:08,550
Alright, guys, next one.

1737
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:10,950
Okay, guys, what should we do for the next one?

1738
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:13,270
I want to do more duplicates.

1739
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,190
Which one's fun?

1740
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:18,150
Can we do all Falcons again?

1741
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:20,230
Should we try that again, guys?

1742
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,210
No, that's not fun.

1743
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:28,290
Okay, I'll try Cera's.

1744
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:30,470
Okay, I've never played Tricera's before.

1745
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,890
So that'll be interesting.

1746
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,090
My god.

1747
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:40,070
Okay, I need camo right now.

1748
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:43,290
Oh my god, I said I need camo.

1749
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,010
Yeah, I'm gonna sit here.

1750
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,110
I'm gonna sit here.

1751
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:53,030
Okay, what's the largest map we can do on... Okay, I wanna do all Falcons again.

1752
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:57,790
And then, uh... I wanna do all Falcons again.

1753
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:01,350
And then we do... We do, uh... Oh my god, wait, they got two?

1754
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:03,390
Wait, when did they cap two points?

1755
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:10,870
And then we do, uh... And then we do all Tricera's.

1756
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,350
And then we'll do a normal match.

1757
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:13,650
Oh my gosh.

1758
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,890
Oh no.

1759
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,930
That's right, camo, baby.

1760
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,480
Alright.

1761
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,340
Alright, Tricera.

1762
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,840
Oh yeah, Tricera.

1763
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,940
I feel like... I feel like the Tricera game is gonna last forever.

1764
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:42,220
Yeah, it sounds like fun.

1765
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,940
What if they do Tricera's versus... Oh shit!

1766
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:46,920
I...

1767
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,140
Tricera's versus Falcons.

1768
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,940
The...

1769
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:55,380
What if... Wait...

1770
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:58,060
The fucking turrets fly...

1771
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,120
Alright, how fucked up...

1772
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,300
If it's Tricera's... Tricera's versus Falcons will lose so fast.

1773
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,740
That I rest in these Falcons.

1774
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,840
Yeah, I feel like...

1775
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,180
The Falcons gotta get... Falcons un-deep-deep-deep-deep-deep-deep-deep-deep.

1776
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,740
We just need to...

1777
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:19,900
Make people...

1778
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,700
Six comedy babies.

1779
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:22,940
Okay, okay.

1780
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:28,960
Okay.

1781
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,020
What just... Okay.

1782
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,160
How do we make it fair then?

1783
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:32,860
Oh shit.

1784
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,100
I might be dead doing this.

1785
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:35,600
Okay.

1786
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:39,060
I need another drone.

1787
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:44,590
Okay.

1788
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:47,450
Oh my god.

1789
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:49,690
Oh fuck.

1790
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,190
Nice.

1791
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:52,810
I got you.

1792
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:53,750
I got you, buddy.

1793
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:54,870
Oh.

1794
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:56,010
I saw you.

1795
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,730
I saw...

1796
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:57,930
Oh.

1797
01:10:58,110 --> 01:10:59,010
You think you're gonna...

1798
01:10:59,010 --> 01:10:59,150
Oh.

1799
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:00,130
I know you're here.

1800
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:01,090
Wait.

1801
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,790
I saw you running around here.

1802
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:04,270
Where the fuck did you go?

1803
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:05,050
Assist.

1804
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:05,470
Okay.

1805
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:05,790
Nice.

1806
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:06,090
Assist.

1807
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:08,050
Oh.

1808
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:09,850
Tricera's versus Sky Raiders.

1809
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:14,770
Woo!

1810
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:15,370
Woo!

1811
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:15,790
Woo!

1812
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:18,610
Nice.

1813
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:19,130
We did it.

1814
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,430
Luminate versus Luminate.

1815
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:25,750
Okay.

1816
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:27,770
Tricera's versus Sky Raiders.

1817
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:29,930
I never played either of them before.

1818
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:36,310
Nice.

1819
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:38,530
I know I'm not MVP.

1820
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:39,270
I fucked around.

1821
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,410
I'm not playing.

1822
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:45,690
Alright.

1823
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:46,890
Let's see.

1824
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,230
What's the overview?

1825
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,750
Wait, did I get any...

1826
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,890
Am I on the board?

1827
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:52,870
I'm not on the board?

1828
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,590
I'm not on the board.

1829
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:56,150
I'm not on the board.

1830
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:57,690
So I don't care.

1831
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,430
Alright.

1832
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:04,490
Alright.

1833
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,330
I'll make a new lobby.

1834
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,650
Alright.

1835
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:06,470
Have you played already?

1836
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,910
Let other dragons have a chance to join as well.

1837
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:09,910
Okay.

1838
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:11,350
Okay.

1839
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:11,410
Wait.

1840
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:13,130
Exit room.

1841
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:14,390
Alright.

1842
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,130
Great room.

1843
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:19,110
Alright.

1844
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:21,450
All Falcons?

1845
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:22,630
Wait.

1846
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:22,890
Okay.

1847
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:23,370
Let's do...

1848
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:25,610
I wanna do 6v6 Falcons.

1849
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:29,630
What is a good...

1850
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:31,850
What's the biggest map for that, guys?

1851
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,720
What's the biggest map for 6v6 Falcons?

1852
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,580
What's the best one?

1853
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,440
I?

1854
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,740
I, Mazira?

1855
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,040
The fuck is I?

1856
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,420
Oh, there you go.

1857
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:49,520
Alright.

1858
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,160
Here we go.

1859
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,080
2-1-7-8-4-4.

1860
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:57,940
Have you...

1861
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,760
Um...

1862
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,260
If you see a dragoon that's played before, rat them out to me and I'll kick them out.

1863
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,420
For today.

1864
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,120
For today.

1865
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:06,460
Um...

1866
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,000
The last...

1867
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,400
The other two streams don't count.

1868
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,160
Just for today.

1869
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:15,440
Yeah, the last match is gonna be the one mech per player.

1870
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:17,640
Okay.

1871
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:18,460
All Falcons.

1872
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,660
No duplic...

1873
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,160
Is there no, like, return players?

1874
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,040
Alright.

1875
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,260
If anyone...

1876
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,780
Anyone that's played before, leave.

1877
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,680
Except for me.

1878
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,280
Cause this is my lobby.

1879
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:33,540
Alright.

1880
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,300
All Falcons.

1881
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,440
All Falcons.

1882
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:42,920
I love this one.

1883
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,160
It's such a shitshow.

1884
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,480
Falcon.

1885
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,660
Ready to strike.

1886
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,000
Whoops, all Falcons.

1887
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:48,560
Falcon.

1888
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,680
Ready to strike.

1889
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:50,460
Falcon.

1890
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,520
Ready to strike.

1891
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,240
Falcon.

1892
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,600
Ready to strike.

1893
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:58,500
Hmm.

1894
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,960
While we wait, I'm gonna get a cough drop real quick.

1895
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,320
With my throat.

1896
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,940
I've been yelling.

1897
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:10,620
Falcon.

1898
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,900
Ready to strike.

1899
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,060
Falcon.

1900
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,260
Ready to strike.

1901
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,850
Alright.

1902
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:37,230
I'm ready to strike.

1903
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:42,590
Me when I'm Falcon and ready to strike.

1904
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:49,170
Alright.

1905
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:50,910
Here we go.

1906
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,680
Forgot how Falcon works.

1907
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:03,460
Cause after that 6v6, I didn't play Falcon again.

1908
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,120
After that 3v3 last time, I didn't play Falcon again.

1909
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,160
Cause that was so overwhelming.

1910
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,000
That was so...

1911
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,440
Alright.

1912
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:22,240
The thing is, it was not...

1913
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,120
Like 3v3 was like insane.

1914
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,500
Like, I don't know how 6v6 is gonna go.

1915
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,360
It's gonna be an actual aerial fight.

1916
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:34,860
An aerial battlefield.

1917
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:35,580
I don't feel it.

1918
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,560
Alright, here we go.

1919
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,320
We're ready to strike.

1920
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,400
I have to play this again.

1921
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,180
Where is the objective?

1922
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,660
Oh my god.

1923
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:55,580
Okay, wait.

1924
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:56,140
Wait!

1925
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,580
I got out of... I literally... I got out of... Oh my god.

1926
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,560
I got out of like...

1927
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,820
Oh, let's go.

1928
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:14,240
Let's get him.

1929
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:14,780
Let's get him.

1930
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,500
Get him, boys.

1931
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,400
Get him.

1932
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,760
Give me a sec.

1933
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:18,260
I got him.

1934
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:18,820
Recharge.

1935
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,080
Give me a sec.

1936
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,260
This falcon's got to recharge.

1937
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:24,520
Alright, here we go.

1938
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,220
Oh, shit.

1939
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,600
Oh, shit.

1940
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,760
Oh my god.

1941
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:33,100
Okay, here we go.

1942
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,640
Crazy.

1943
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,220
Guys, I got to recharge.

1944
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,500
Cover me.

1945
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,880
Oh!

1946
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,980
I said cover me!

1947
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,280
Guys!

1948
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,580
Man down.

1949
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,000
Man down.

1950
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,620
Man down.

1951
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:58,060
They cover you in bullets.

1952
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,080
Holy shit.

1953
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,700
Oh my god.

1954
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:04,940
Okay, that guy is gaming.

1955
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:05,700
What the fuck?

1956
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,620
Falcon down.

1957
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:09,840
Falcon down.

1958
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:10,560
Falcon down.

1959
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,780
Okay, don't worry.

1960
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:14,840
Okay.

1961
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,140
Falcon here.

1962
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,580
The sky is ours.

1963
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:18,400
Oh god.

1964
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,400
Oh god.

1965
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:19,500
Oh god.

1966
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,160
I'm being shot at.

1967
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:20,560
Team!

1968
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:24,680
Don't worry, team!

1969
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:25,820
What?

1970
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:27,980
What?

1971
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,000
What?

1972
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,100
What?

1973
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,060
I was so... I had so much HP!

1974
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,060
What happened?

1975
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,040
What happened?

1976
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:41,850
Oh my god.

1977
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,550
I... I was out of bounds.

1978
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:44,210
I don't...

1979
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,210
The sky was like, no.

1980
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:54,550
I flew too close to the sun.

1981
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,070
I can't believe it.

1982
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,250
I actually... I didn't even notice.

1983
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:00,990
I flew too close to the sun.

1984
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:01,150
Oh my god.

1985
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:03,450
That's crazy.

1986
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:07,050
I actually... got sunned.

1987
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:10,590
Oh my god.

1988
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,250
Where is everybody?

1989
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:13,770
Oh shit!

1990
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:15,110
Oh shit!

1991
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:18,490
Guys!

1992
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:19,290
Where's my team?

1993
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:22,870
Oh my god.

1994
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:23,430
He doesn't know.

1995
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:24,970
Oh, he doesn't know.

1996
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:26,930
The sky is ours.

1997
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:27,170
Oh.

1998
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:28,590
Guys.

1999
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:29,870
Guys, team!

2000
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,620
Oh my god.

2001
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:37,920
Whoa!

2002
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:41,620
Falcon here.

2003
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:42,600
No!

2004
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:43,480
What?

2005
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,020
Okay.

2006
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,400
I got 1v1 indoor.

2007
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:52,300
You're crazy.

2008
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,880
Bro, I can't get out!

2009
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,140
Oh my god.

2010
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:56,800
The outside.

2011
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,600
Literally, my entire job is to be inside and I somehow became on outside.

2012
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,960
Sorry, my entire job is to be outside.

2013
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,080
Oh shit.

2014
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:10,900
Oh my god.

2015
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,280
I got recharged.

2016
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,480
He doesn't know.

2017
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:16,620
He don't know I'm here.

2018
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:18,180
Damn.

2019
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:21,980
Oh my.

2020
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,360
I'm trying to head over.

2021
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,120
I'm trying my best!

2022
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,980
He's flying so much!

2023
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,320
Look at him!

2024
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:33,760
Look at him!

2025
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,340
Where did he go?

2026
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,600
Oh my god.

2027
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,960
It's just a warfare here.

2028
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,320
Where the fuck did he go?

2029
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:44,620
Where's the key?

2030
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,100
Oh my god.

2031
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:49,740
Where's the key?

2032
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:50,780
I can't tell.

2033
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,620
I can't tell where the key is!

2034
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,200
Oh no.

2035
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,380
No, I can't do that yet.

2036
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,540
He got...

2037
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:01,000
No!

2038
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,080
He got the key!

2039
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,100
Oh, he just kept looping!

2040
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:09,580
Oh my god.

2041
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:09,760
Got you.

2042
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,700
That's why you can't run from me.

2043
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:12,980
You can't run from me.

2044
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:13,880
I'm literally on your tail.

2045
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,200
On your six!

2046
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,780
On your six!

2047
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,800
On your fucking six!

2048
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,380
I won't rest until you're dead.

2049
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:29,040
Oh shit.

2050
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,300
Someone's on my six now.

2051
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,140
Oh my god.

2052
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:34,060
Okay.

2053
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:36,580
Oh my god.

2054
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,020
Someone's on my six!

2055
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:39,960
Oh!

2056
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:41,760
I gotta get up!

2057
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:42,860
I gotta get up!

2058
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,260
I gotta get up!

2059
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:46,460
Woo!

2060
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:48,620
Woo!

2061
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,960
That's right, loop-de-loop!

2062
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,420
Okay, loop-de-loop!

2063
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,320
This guy is ours!

2064
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,960
We might be losing!

2065
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,340
But that was a cool loop-de-loop!

2066
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:01,300
Okay.

2067
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:02,520
I need to like...

2068
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,380
Oh no, he knows I'm a...

2069
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,360
Oh no, they know!

2070
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,260
They know!

2071
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:07,640
They know!

2072
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,420
They know I'm a grounded...

2073
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,040
I'm a grounded play right now!

2074
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:13,600
Oh no.

2075
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,100
Oh, I'm warning!

2076
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:15,820
Warning!

2077
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,060
I can't see!

2078
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:21,620
I can't see!

2079
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,300
Oh, I'm leaving the combat!

2080
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:22,840
So good!

2081
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:32,020
I got this guy.

2082
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:33,700
What's the staff?

2083
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,060
Oh, I'm so dead.

2084
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,800
I am so dead, though.

2085
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,260
There's no way.

2086
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,480
Oh, I don't know where I am.

2087
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,580
I can't see!

2088
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,740
Oh my god, there's upward loops!

2089
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,380
How many loops are there?

2090
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:52,460
Okay.

2091
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,880
Wait, I could go down faster?

2092
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,120
I'm blind, blind.

2093
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,020
I'm blind.

2094
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,200
Oh my god.

2095
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,440
They don't know.

2096
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,100
Don't know.

2097
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:12,940
Surely they won't hit me, right?

2098
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:14,140
Alright.

2099
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,580
I should be okay now.

2100
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,340
That's right.

2101
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,840
Oh shit, not again.

2102
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,820
Oh, I'm getting better at this, though.

2103
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,400
I'm getting so much better at this.

2104
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:32,640
Assist time!

2105
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,640
Oh, I can see now.

2106
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:36,180
I can see!

2107
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,020
Oh, I'm going for this guy.

2108
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,820
That's right, I'm going for you.

2109
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:42,420
Oh!

2110
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,040
Nobody can stop me!

2111
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,020
I should head down.

2112
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,440
I see you!

2113
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:51,740
I see you!

2114
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,420
I see you!

2115
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,560
I see you!

2116
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:55,640
I see you!

2117
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,980
That's fucking right, we're all here for you!

2118
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:01,960
Where is he?

2119
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,840
Oh, we're all here.

2120
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,160
I'm fucking chasing you down.

2121
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,720
Oh shit, we're out of bounds.

2122
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,360
I'm still going to chase you down.

2123
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,220
I can't see, but I can fight!

2124
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,760
I don't need to see to fight!

2125
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:22,920
Oh my god.

2126
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,560
Oh my god.

2127
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,620
Oh my god.

2128
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,420
Oh my god.

2129
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,780
Oh my god.

2130
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,600
Oh my god.

2131
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:41,700
Oh my god.

2132
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:42,260
Oh my god.

2133
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:42,520
Oh my god.

2134
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:44,820
Oh my god.

2135
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:45,820
Oh my god.

2136
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:45,880
Oh my god.

2137
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:45,900
Oh my god.

2138
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:46,100
Oh my god.

2139
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:46,420
Oh my god.

2140
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:46,620
Oh my god.

2141
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:47,320
Oh my god.

2142
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:47,880
Oh my god.

2143
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:48,080
Oh my god.

2144
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:48,820
Oh my god.

2145
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,660
Oh my god.

2146
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,460
Oh my god.

2147
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,860
Oh my god.

2148
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,040
TELL MY WIFE!

2149
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,420
That was a cool death.

2150
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,040
It was cool.

2151
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:09,220
Alright.

2152
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,620
Great...

2153
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:16,000
Great last words.

2154
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,680
Bro, I was like zooming.

2155
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,040
I zoomed so hard.

2156
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:23,640
I went out with a bang.

2157
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:33,340
I tell my wife, I died sick as fuck.

2158
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:41,590
That was an insane dogfight.

2159
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:48,010
Oh shit, they got the key again.

2160
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:49,930
Don't worry, I'm heading over.

2161
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:52,470
I'm heading over.

2162
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:55,570
Battle ends in 180 seconds.

2163
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:56,930
Wait, where's the key?

2164
01:24:57,770 --> 01:24:58,650
Oh my god.

2165
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:59,610
Oh my god.

2166
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:02,270
Jesus Christ, I'm lost.

2167
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:03,050
Oh, there it is.

2168
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:07,170
Fuck!

2169
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:10,430
Oh my god, he's over there now.

2170
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,450
Bro, what the fuck?

2171
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:13,010
He didn't have to?

2172
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:16,790
Holy shit, they have to.

2173
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:19,430
Get him, somebody get him!

2174
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:25,450
Guys, please.

2175
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,820
We all tried to shoot him!

2176
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,900
We all tried to shoot him!

2177
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,720
No!

2178
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,140
I can't believe it.

2179
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,500
I can't believe it.

2180
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,140
We were so close.

2181
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,520
Oh, Falcon.

2182
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,660
Oh, Falcon was crazy.

2183
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:56,840
That was actually like an aerial battlefield.

2184
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,360
Excuse me?

2185
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,120
Excuse me.

2186
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:02,020
Excuse.

2187
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,000
Okay, I was gonna say.

2188
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:06,060
What the fuck is your stats?

2189
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,320
What a fucking game.

2190
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,900
Holy shit.

2191
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:20,000
No, we did, we tried, we did do all Narukami.

2192
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:20,800
It was crazy.

2193
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:25,620
If you got, if you got like, sighted by one person.

2194
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:30,700
Um, like, you're just, like, if you get sighted by two Narukami, it was over.

2195
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:31,300
Alright.

2196
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,020
I wanna do a...

2197
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:34,760
I wanna do a...

2198
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:36,760
Uh...

2199
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:37,720
I wanna do Payload.

2200
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:38,660
Payload was fun.

2201
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:39,240
Actually, no.

2202
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,080
Uh, Operation Verge.

2203
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:42,860
Which is...

2204
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:43,100
Okay.

2205

Um...

2206
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,080
What were the three...

2207
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:46,940
What were the game modes?

2208
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,120
Okay, that, the...

2209
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,440
Okay, we're gonna do a Tricera.

2210
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,900
We're gonna do a death match for Tricera.

2211
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:56,020
Or like, the one where like, it's kills.

2212
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:59,860
Alright, I do kills for that.

2213
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,220
Okay, well actually, what kind of map is good for Tricera?

2214
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,620
What kind of kills are good for Tricera?

01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:07,260

Or what map, sorry.

2217
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,320
What kind of map is good for Tricera?

2218
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:11,440
None?

2219
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:13,720
Okay, yeah, wait.

01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:14,240
Payload.

2221
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,960
Payload, let's do Payload.

2222
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:17,000
Okay.

2223
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,960
Which was a good Payload map?

2224
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:19,960
Guys, help me pick.

2225
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,520
Help me pick a good Payload map for him.

2226
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:27,550
Yeah, we're playing Customs.

2227
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:32,560
Okay.

2228
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,540
Long minute.

2229
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:37,580
Alright, get in here.

2230
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:38,940
Have you played already?

2231
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,240
Let other dragoons have a chance to join.

2232
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:47,200
Um, and other dragoons will rat you up if you rejoin the lobby.

2233
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,260
Let's see.

2234
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:56,840
Any repeaters chat?

2235
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:57,580
Other than me?

2236
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:58,740
Because I made the lobby.

2237
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,780
Okay, okay.

2238
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:04,520
Then we'll start.

2239
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:05,340
Alright.

2240
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,280
All...

2241
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:08,940
All Triceras.

2242
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:11,440
Alright.

2243
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,060
Yeah.

2244
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,280
We snicked you out.

2245
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:15,660
We snicked you out.

2246
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,100
Alright.

2247
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,180
All Triceras.

2248
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,300
I don't think I've ever...

2249
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:22,800
Guys.

2250
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:24,540
Oh, guys.

2251
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:24,920
Sorry.

2252
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:25,820
Sorry.

2253
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:26,360
We...

2254
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,340
Sorry.

2255
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,440
I remake...

2256
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,200
Love me.

2257
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,000
I don't own Triceras.

2258
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:46,140
I don't own Triceras.

2259
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:46,700
I don't own Triceras.

2260
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I can't leave!

2261
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:54,900
Dude!

2262
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,500
Wait, can I leave in-game?!

2263
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:05,640
Okay, we play it out.

2264
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,380
Play whatever.

2265
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,260
Play whatever you want.

2266
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,200
What?

2267
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,260
No, I'm not good.

2268
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,460
Play whatever.

2269
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:17,880
Play whatever.

2270
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,640
Okay, or try Sarah.

2271
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,880
Okay, I play whatever I want.

2272
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,080
Wait.

2273
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:27,960
Oh, shit!

2274
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:28,460
No!

2275
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:30,300
I didn't have a time!

2276
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,520
Oh, shit!

2277
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,120
Oh, shit!

2278
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,320
Oh, shit!

2279
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,340
I didn't have a time!

2280
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:41,440
I didn't have a time!

2281
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:44,680
I didn't have a time!

2282
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,020
I didn't have a time!

2283
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:46,100
Oh, shit!

2284
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,460
Okay, I'm so fucked!

2285
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,000
The one falcon in the sea of tribes, Sarah!

2286
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,700
I'm so fucked!

2287
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,140
I'm so dead!

2288
01:29:59,300 --> 01:29:59,960
I'm so fucked!

2289
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:09,940
Oh, shit!

2290
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:10,480
Sorry!

2291
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,260
Each of us has one falcon!

2292
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:13,960
Wait!

2293
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:15,060
Tracer!

2294
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:15,740
Tracer!

2295
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:16,160
Oh, wait!

2296
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:16,740
Aquila!

2297
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,840
Oh, shit!

2298
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,320
Don't worry, team!

2299
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:20,860
I believe in us!

2300
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:23,380
We can't kill the two Aquila!

2301
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,960
I believe in us!

2302
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,320
Don't worry!

2303
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,080
Don't worry!

2304
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:28,120
Don't worry!

2305
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:28,160
Don't worry!

2306
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,420
I'll help!

2307
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,440
I'll help!

2308
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:31,860
Guys, don't worry!

2309
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,780
Don't worry!

2310
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,380
Don't worry!

2311
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:40,940
Don't worry!

2312
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,720
I'll help!

2313
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:43,840
I'll help!

2314
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,960
No, I'm helping.

2315
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:50,360
I'm helping Wolfsy.

2316
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:57,020
Guys, I don't know.

2317
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:00,760
I don't know if we can win.

2318
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,380
Guys, I'm a little scared.

2319
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:11,380
I'll stay here behind my shield.

2320
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:13,980
Behind my Tricero's shield.

2321
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:17,940
I'll stay here.

2322
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,740
My little Tricero's shield.

2323
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,160
Right there.

2324
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:37,800
Where did she go?

2325
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,360
Where did Aquila go?

2326
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,520
I saw her.

2327
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:45,600
Oh, there she is.

2328
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,060
Are we okay?

2329
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:48,240
I can't tell.

2330
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,840
What the fuck is going on?

2331
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:58,280
There's so many Tricero's.

2332
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:05,390
There's so...

2333
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:08,270
Oh my god.

2334
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:09,670
This is actually crazy.

2335
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:11,190
This is...

2336
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:15,370
Oh my god.

2337
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:16,590
Whoops.

2338
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:19,150
Oh shit.

2339
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:21,150
Don't worry.

2340
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:24,090
Don't worry.

2341
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:24,610
I got you.

2342
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:26,670
Don't worry.

2343
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:27,390
I got you.

2344
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:29,610
The Falcon is here.

2345
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:31,950
Oh shit.

2346
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:33,490
The other Falcon is chasing me though.

2347
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:34,530
Oh my god.

2348
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:35,090
Oh shit.

2349
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:36,710
Oh shit.

2350
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:37,170
Oh shit.

2351
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:37,770
Don't you get it?

2352
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:38,790
Oh shit.

2353
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:40,590
No!

2354
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:46,390
It's fortress v fortress right now.

2355
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:52,770
This shit is crazy.

2356
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:53,830
This shit.

2357
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:54,670
This shit.

2358
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:55,490
This shit.

2359
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:58,150
I should've flew to my tank.

2360
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:00,630
My tank would've saved me.

2361
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:02,470
Tank save me!

2362
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:06,570
Okay, I did not lose to my mirrorash.

2363
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:11,850
I was getting fucking shot down by an Aquila before the goddamn mirror match showed up.

2364
01:33:12,690 --> 01:33:15,130
What the fuck is this Tricera doing on high ground?

2365
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:18,350
Like, what are you doing down there?

2366
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:24,990
What the fuck are you doing down there?

2367
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:27,170
Oh my god.

2368
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:28,910
Oh my god.

2369
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:29,750
Get me out of here.

2370
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:31,830
Actually get me out of here.

2371
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:33,310
Oh my god.

2372
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:34,950
Castle!

2373
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:36,050
My fortress!

2374
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:39,110
Don't worry.

2375
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:42,330
My fortress is gonna be here to help me.

2376
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:45,290
Don't worry, I got you!

2377
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:47,410
I got you!

2378
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:49,850
Don't worry, I got you!

2379
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:51,390
Oh my god, the flying fortress!

2380
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:52,650
Don't worry!

2381
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,730
The flying fortress is here!

2382
01:33:58,610 --> 01:34:00,910
Holy shit, that shit's crazy.

2383
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:09,310
Oh my god, thank god it's not, like, all... Thank god it's not all fucking, uh...

2384
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:11,470
All Triceras.

2385
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:14,270
Because I'd be so fucked if the enemy team was just all Triceras.

2386
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:15,670
That'd be so scary.

2387
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:19,990
Oh my god, my little peas.

2388
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:22,050
My little peas are shooting.

2389
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:22,690
How?

2390
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:24,390
What is going on?

2391
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:29,270
Oh my god, please.

2392
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:33,090
There you go, it's fine.

2393
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:34,410
I'm helping.

2394
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:35,750
I'm helping.

2395
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:37,350
I'm helping.

2396
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:38,570
I'm helping.

2397
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:39,770
Helping.

2398
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:43,330
I'm pretty sure I'm helping, I can't tell.

2399
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:45,470
It looks like I'm helping.

2400
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:47,830
I... I look...

2401
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:49,570
Oh my god.

2402
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:54,430
Jesus Christ.

2403
01:34:57,510 --> 01:34:58,050
Okay.

2404
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:02,470
Jesus Christ, I'm trying to fly.

2405
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:03,970
I'm trying to fly here.

2406
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:06,850
Trying to fly.

2407
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:08,010
Oh shit.

2408
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:11,750
Oh my god, he's still out there?

2409
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:13,570
What is our other Tricera doing?

2410
01:35:15,130 --> 01:35:15,730
Stabilizing.

2411
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:17,610
How is he still out there?

2412
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:22,860
Okay.

2413
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,080
Don't worry, I got you.

2414
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,640
I got you.

2415
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,480
Oh my god, I don't know how I'm getting healed.

2416
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,980
Wait, how am I getting healed?

2417
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:37,620
Oh my god, I got you.

2418
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:38,360
I got you.

2419
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:39,380
Oh my god, he has shield.

2420
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,420
I don't got you.

2421
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:41,540
I don't got you.

2422
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:42,380
I'm getting sniped too.

2423
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:43,260
I don't got you.

2424
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:46,200
Okay.

2425
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,220
Oh, Tricera has shield drawn?

2426
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:52,420
Oh my god, what doesn't he...

2427
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:54,000
What doesn't he have?

2428
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,060
Oh my god, you stupid Aquila.

2429
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,980
Aquila, you stupid Aquila.

2430
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:02,360
I'm just walking very slowly.

2431
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:07,120
I can just stay here.

2432
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:08,420
It's okay.

2433
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,580
I cannot just stay here.

2434
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,700
I cannot just...

2435
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,360
It's okay, I won.

2436
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,080
Yay.

2437
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:21,100
Yeah.

2438
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,860
The snatch comes for the better.

2439
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:25,720
Yay.

2440
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,520
But at what cost?

2441
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,920
The slowest match.

2442
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,520
Holy shit.

2443
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,660
That match is crazy.

2444
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,080
We still won.

2445
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:43,820
Let's go.

2446
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:45,840
You're back.

2447
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:47,360
You're back.

2448
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:49,980
Ha!

2449
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,960
The Junkler was here.

2450
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:56,160
It's...

2451
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:56,670
It's...

2452
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:57,060
It's...

2453
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,220
Why is he...

2454
01:36:58,220 --> 01:36:58,960
Yay!

2455
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:01,860
I got carried by the Junkler.

2456
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,180
He...

2457
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:03,460
He...

2458
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:04,540
He...

2459
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:05,300
Um...

2460
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,400
Circle...

2461
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:06,480
What?

2462
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:07,720
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2463
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,120
Thank you, thank you.

2464
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:11,780
Oh my god, he's real.

2465
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,680
He's actually real.

2466
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:15,480
Oh my god.

2467
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,120
He's...

2468
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:17,920
He's...

2469
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:18,620
He's yonking it.

2470
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,280
My bad.

2471
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:20,540
He's...

2472
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,060
He's...

2473
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,200
Like...

2474
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,240
Hello...

2475
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,340
I'm so serious.

2476
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,380
He...

2477
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:26,340
That's actually crazy.

2478
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,420
That is a crazy customization right there.

2479
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:30,760
Alright.

2480
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:31,400
Now...

2481
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:31,980
Next room.

2482
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:32,080
Boom.

2483
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:34,980
Alright.

2484
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:38,080
That's technically a tricera match, guys.

2485
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,880
That's technically a tricera match.

2486
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:47,580
Alright, this one, you can play anything you want.

2487
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,280
This next game.

2488
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:50,980
Boom!

2489
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:55,460
This is already... that was already too much tricera.

2490
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:59,620
Alright, this one, you can play anything you want for this.

2491
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,640
Anything you want.

2492
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:07,030
Alright, any repeaters chat?

2493
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:09,170
Anyone you want to rat out?

2494
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:15,450
Alright guys, if you guys want to join in this custom lobby, make sure to download the game right now.

2495
01:38:15,650 --> 01:38:16,630
It is free to play.

2496
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:22,430
So click on the link that's in pinned on my chat or exclamation point Mecha break, guys.

2497
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:26,710
And you too can join the lobby or just support the stream in general.

2498
01:38:28,150 --> 01:38:32,510
And if you watch enough for today, you can unlock...

2499
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:36,330
Let's see, I need to get the image real fast.

2500
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:39,550
You can unlock a cat girl where your twitch drops.

2501
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:43,210
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to zoom in that.

2502
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:51,550
So yes, this is your last chance to get your cat girl, uh, cat girl items for free.

2503
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:54,150
Whoa, yeah, whoa.

2504
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:55,910
Whoa, wowee.

2505
01:38:56,710 --> 01:38:57,810
Alright, we have...

2506
01:38:57,810 --> 01:38:59,650
Let me show you how much time you have.

2507
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:00,210
We have 24 minutes.

2508
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:01,690
So we can do like two to three of my games.

2509
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:03,790
Panther, ready to strike.

2510
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:06,230
Alright, I'm gonna do a... not falcon.

2511
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:07,310
I'm done with falcon.

2512
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:09,010
I'm gonna do...

2513
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:11,130
Narukami.

2514
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:17,750
Alright, you can play whatever you want, guys, for this one.

2515
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:20,170
Luminate, ready to strike.

2516
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:21,330
How do I do twitch?

2517
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:22,690
You just have to watch the stream.

2518
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:24,390
And then you get your twitch drops.

2519
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:26,530
And make sure your, um...

2520
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:28,470
I think it's... make sure your steam is linked to your...

2521
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:30,290
Uh, to your twitch.

2522
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:32,050
So you can lock it.

2523
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,340
You play hurricane at all?

2524
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,360
No, I'm a Narukami Aquila.

2525
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,920
Uh, scumbag.

2526
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,040
Um...

2527
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:45,180
Yeah.

2528
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,400
I can't... I can't... I can't melee.

2529
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,220
And I don't like playing tank.

2530
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:56,220
I know what I am.

2531
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:02,040
I know... I know what I am in this world.

2532
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:06,540
Uh...

2533
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:07,660
I like it though.

2534
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:08,960
I like the gameplay style.

2535
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:10,500
A cowboy!

2536
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:13,180
You're just mad.

2537
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:14,520
Mad cause bad.

2538
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:19,400
Seems like a guy who's been killed by a Narukami.

2539
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:30,100
Alright.

2540
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,300
Locking in.

2541
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:37,300
Oh, wait.

2542
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,600
Someone, someone's a falcon.

2543
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:40,340
We gotta kill him.

2544
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:44,550
Alright.

2545
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:45,050
Here we go.

2546
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:46,730
Haha.

2547
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:49,410
I can't believe someone's playing falcon.

2548
01:40:51,970 --> 01:40:52,990
Wait, do we have support?

2549
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:53,410
Oh, we do.

2550
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:54,190
Okay, we have Illuminae.

2551
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:55,910
I was gonna say...

2552
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:57,190
Okay, we better have a support here.

2553
01:40:57,570 --> 01:40:58,570
Alright, pocket me guys.

2554
01:40:59,050 --> 01:40:59,970
Pocket the sniper.

2555
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:06,250
That's right, no falcons allowed.

2556
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:08,390
What objective is this?

2557
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:10,130
It is...

2558
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:11,250
Oh, is this...

2559
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:13,210
Okay.

2560
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:14,090
Okay.

2561
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:18,270
Oh no, it's this.

2562
01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:19,890
Oh, wait.

2563
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:20,710
Okay, that's good.

2564
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:22,210
Okay, I was gonna say where the fuck is.

2565
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:24,130
Oh, it's this map.

2566
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,810
Oh, it's this one.

2567
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:29,650
Okay.

2568
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:31,170
Oh, I don't like this map.

2569
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:51,160
I'm so mad.

2570
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,700
That was gonna be...

2571
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:54,540
That was gonna be such an easy shot too.

2572
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,660
That was gonna be...

2573
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,520
That was gonna be...

2574
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,960
That was gonna be such an easy shot.

2575
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:03,420
Oh my god, you stupid whore.

2576
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,840
You're such a stupid whore.

2577
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:12,460
That would've been such an easy kill.

2578
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:18,920
I see you.

2579
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:27,400
Oh my god, you're such a whore.

2580
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:35,780
Okay.

2581
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:40,320
Okay.

2582
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:42,720
Stupid falcon.

2583
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,480
God, someone killed a falcon.

2584
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:48,980
No!

2585
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:51,400
No!

2586
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,200
No!

2587
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,340
It's not fair.

2588
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,160
It's not fair.

2589
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:02,400
It's not fair.

2590
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,440
No one's harassing him!

2591
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:07,380
Oh my god, look at this.

2592
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:09,040
Oh my god, that is so sad.

2593
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,800
That is actually so sad.

2594
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,140
Watch me slowly, slowly walk up.

2595
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:17,200
That's actually so sad.

2596
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,420
He waited until I got to the top.

2597
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,580
That's so fucked up.

2598
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:25,380
That's so fucked up.

2599
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:26,560
Wait, we have a...

2600
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:27,000
No!

2601
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:28,140
We have an EMT!

2602
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:28,880
Aquila!

2603
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:32,220
Aquila, don't wake up!

2604
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,220
The people need you!

2605
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:39,780
The people need you!

2606
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:41,660
Aquila, no!

2607
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:43,760
Wake up!

2608
01:43:48,810 --> 01:43:49,810
Oh no.

2609
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,440
Oh my god.

2610
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:58,380
Wake up, Aquila.

2611
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:01,820
Aquila, wake up!

2612
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,040
Aquila, wake up!

2613
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,500
Goddammit, there's that falcon.

2614
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:10,320
I see him too.

2615
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:18,540
Oh my god.

2616
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,900
There's the Norukami.

2617
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:27,840
I see you.

2618
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:35,230
That's right, they don't know.

2619
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:37,090
Wait, what?

2620
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:38,570
Oh, they already captured it.

2621
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:38,850
Okay.

2622
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:40,270
I was gonna say, what?

2623
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:47,220
Spy.

2624
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,040
Why?

2625
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:50,620
I see the...

2626
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:52,080
I see a falcon near me.

2627
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:52,880
I fucking...

2628
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,200
Okay, that's not falcon, but I...

2629
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,660
I felt something behind me.

2630
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:56,960
Oh, fuck.

2631
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:58,100
That's right.

2632
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:58,980
Fuck you, bitch.

2633
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:00,320
Nice.

2634
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:03,820
Oh no.

2635
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:05,220
There's someone here.

2636
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:07,580
Oh no.

2637
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,380
Nice.

2638
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,880
Nice.

2639
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,060
Nice.

2640
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:26,020
Whoa!

2641
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:27,840
What the fuck?

2642
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:32,660
What the fuck?

2643
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,960
What's he doing in the water?!

2644
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:39,860
You freaks!

2645
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,320
You goddamn freak!

2646
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,120
There he is!

2647
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:47,460
How is he still there?

2648
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:52,360
Why was he there?!

2649
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,080
Oh my god.

2650
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:03,200
Oh my god, I don't know why the fuck he was there, though.

2651
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,860
Oh my god, I need to, like, move around so much.

2652
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,040
Oh,

2653
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:18,140
he's one.

2654
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:20,780
He's so dumb.

2655
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:30,210
Don't know.

2656
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:40,960
It's stupid.

2657
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:44,220
It's stupid.

2658
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:48,860
He broke right on his face, that BF.

2659
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:52,420
That's right, that's what you get from being stupid.

2660
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:56,460
I don't know how we got away with that, but I take those.

2661
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:00,820
I take those.

2662
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:07,980
No.

2663
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,720
I don't even know.

2664
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,220
It works, it works.

2665
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,200
It works.

2666
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:21,380
Aquila, ready to provide aerial cover.

2667
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:22,840
Aquila is ready.

2668
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,960
I'm ready.

2669
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:33,560
It just works, yeah.

2670
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:38,580
Jesus Christ.

2671
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,660
Oh my god.

2672
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:55,200
I'm just shooting him so he doesn't cap it.

2673
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:58,000
Holy shit.

2674
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:00,300
Maybe I can grab.

2675
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:02,220
Let me see if I can grab C.

2676
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:03,420
Thank you.

2677
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:04,580
Alright.

2678
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,360
I know, the shield for Tricera is crazy.

2679
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,040
That's why you guys saw I did one round.

2680
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,600
Tricera.

2681
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:14,520
I can't do another.

2682
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:16,880
Oh nice, we got C, that's good.

2683
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:19,780
I was like, I'm not doing another round of Tricera.

2684
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:20,400
I'm sorry.

2685
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,560
I have to come up.

2686
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,080
Come on.

2687
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:30,820
Show yourself.

2688
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:34,260
Show yourself.

2689
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,520
You have to come out of the water someday, right?

2690
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,820
Fucking hell.

2691
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,460
Oh my god, fucking hell.

2692
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:45,120
Are you serious?

2693
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:51,620
Are you fucking kidding me?

2694
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:58,200
Of course, of course the Falcon is fine we won.

2695
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,520
Fuck you, I hope you had fun Falcon.

2696
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:05,820
Of course, there was nothing else around us.

2697
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:11,140
It's okay, we won.

2698
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,460
That's all that matters.

2699
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:13,720
We did it.

2700
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,020
All my homies hate Falcon.

2701
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:20,000
It's okay, we won.

2702
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:24,120
I did it.

2703
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,540
I was part of that team.

2704
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:33,100
I did it.

2705
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:36,020
I assisted.

2706
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:39,740
Target destroyed.

2707
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:40,880
All right.

2708
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,680
We have time for, I think, one more.

2709
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:45,440
All right, we make the...

2710
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,340
All right, I want to do one deathmatch game.

2711
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:48,020
All right.

2712
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:49,660
Let's see, whoops.

2713
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:51,820
Let's do one deathmatch.

2714
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,700
And then, if we have time, we'll do one more Operation Verge.

2715
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:57,680
All right.

2716
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:00,020
I want to be Aquila.

2717
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:02,820
All right, get in here.

2718
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:03,800
We're deathmatching.

2719
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:06,680
I'm doing my part.

2720
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:10,280
All Falcon players should be taxed to Eviate.

2721
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:12,400
All right, we need one more.

2722
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:13,620
All right, guys.

2723
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:15,240
It's Aquila time.

2724
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:17,820
Give me Aquila or I throw.

2725
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:20,540
Wait.

2726
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:23,040
Jay Gunslinger already played?

2727
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:24,800
Oh, you rat.

2728
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:28,640
You rat.

2729
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:33,060
Well, he has to stay now.

2730
01:50:37,170 --> 01:50:37,970
All right.

2731
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:39,250
We got him.

2732
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:41,690
We know what you are.

2733
01:50:42,750 --> 01:50:45,390
We know what you are, gunslinger.

2734
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:47,750
We know what you are.

2735
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:50,790
From chat.

2736
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:52,650
Pilot proceeding on board.

2737
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:54,410
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2738
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:55,210
Thank you.

2739
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:55,510
Name.

2740
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:56,830
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2741
01:50:56,930 --> 01:50:57,170
Thank you.

2742
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:57,550
Thank you.

2743
01:50:57,650 --> 01:50:58,530
We'll never forget.

2744
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:00,730
That you're a repeat gamer.

2745
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:03,250
We know.

2746
01:51:03,650 --> 01:51:04,010
Shame.

2747
01:51:04,690 --> 01:51:05,170
Shame.

2748
01:51:09,950 --> 01:51:10,930
All right, here we go.

2749
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:13,530
Shame him.

2750
01:51:14,910 --> 01:51:16,850
I don't know if my aim is better or not.

2751
01:51:16,850 --> 01:51:19,010
I don't know if my mouse is still out.

2752
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:21,450
I have no idea.

2753
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:28,940
All right, here we go.

2754
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:34,110
Come on, I better be slightly better.

2755
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:37,450
Aquila!

2756
01:51:37,910 --> 01:51:38,590
That's me!

2757
01:51:39,010 --> 01:51:39,830
Oh, no.

2758
01:51:40,010 --> 01:51:41,650
This is like the storm ones, too.

2759
01:51:43,310 --> 01:51:45,070
Is this three Falcons?

2760
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:46,170
Oh, my God.

2761
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:47,110
It's three Falcons.

2762
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:48,770
Oh, my God.

2763
01:51:48,930 --> 01:51:49,770
It's three Falcons.

2764
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:56,590
It's three Falcons.

2765
01:52:01,770 --> 01:52:02,470
It's three Falcons.

2766
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:04,470
It's three Falcons.

2767
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:09,070
It's three Falcons.

2768
01:52:09,070 --> 01:52:09,990
Oh, my God.

2769
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:11,470
Guys, I need help.

2770
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:12,610
I need help.

2771
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:21,090
Oh my god, guys, I have all three Falcons on me.

2772
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:30,910
Guys, guys, I have all three Falcons on my ass right now.

2773
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:33,510
It's all Falcons.

2774
01:52:34,730 --> 01:52:36,890
It's all Falcons.

2775
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:39,990
It's like... I didn't know.

2776
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:42,250
What the... That's it.

2777
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:43,790
Oh, that's it.

2778
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:45,070
Guys, how do I swap characters?

2779
01:52:45,570 --> 01:52:46,170
That's it.

2780
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:47,670
That's it.

2781
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:51,590
I... I don't... Oh, that's it.

2782
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:53,550
I know what I'm first.

2783
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:54,150
No.

2784
01:52:54,730 --> 01:52:56,190
Who's all Falcons?

2785
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:58,290
Oh, that's it.

2786
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:02,770
I know exactly what I'm gonna do the moment I die.

2787
01:53:04,710 --> 01:53:05,550
Oh my god.

2788
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:06,670
I know what I'm gonna do.

2789
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:18,120
Oh my god.

2790
01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:26,250
Oh my god.

2791
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:27,850
Please.

2792
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:31,490
Jesus Christ.

2793
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:34,290
It's like trying to shoot like a fucking mosquito.

2794
01:53:34,770 --> 01:53:37,090
It's like actually... Okay, that's it.

2795
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:38,630
I'm angry.

2796
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:41,130
How do I swap characters?

2797
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:45,270
I hate... That's it.

2798
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:46,650
God damn it.

2799
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:48,950
I forgot to get Tricera.

2800
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:51,310
I still forgot.

2801
01:53:51,670 --> 01:53:53,330
Alright, I don't know how this is.

2802
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:55,510
I thought I was gonna go Tricera.

2803
01:53:55,730 --> 01:53:58,510
I don't know what character this is.

2804
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:01,790
I don't have Tricera.

2805
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:03,050
He's so lucky.

2806
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:04,670
This is a shield.

2807
01:54:04,990 --> 01:54:05,750
That's it.

2808
01:54:05,950 --> 01:54:07,690
I have a shield now.

2809
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:15,730
I have a shield.

2810
01:54:16,530 --> 01:54:17,350
That's it.

2811
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:20,190
Someone quick go try Tricera.

2812
01:54:20,690 --> 01:54:22,210
It's the only way.

2813
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:24,910
It's the only way.

2814
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:30,830
It's the only way.

2815
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:32,210
Someone go try Tricera.

2816
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:37,210
Oh no, not the storm.

2817
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:40,490
They have a shield.

2818
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:42,010
I...

2819
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:46,630
Oh shit, I went in the storm still.

2820
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:48,450
I went in the storm.

2821
01:54:49,490 --> 01:54:50,650
Oh, go Sega!

2822
01:54:51,030 --> 01:54:52,310
Go Sega everybody!

2823
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:00,980
Alright.

2824
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:04,520
Oh my god.

2825
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,080
Not the Falcons there.

2826
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,780
It's actually crazy.

2827
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,220
Oh.

2828
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:17,620
Oh my god.

2829
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,300
Oh my god.

2830
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,400
This is so cringe.

2831
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,160
Oh my god.

2832
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:27,040
They're so lucky.

2833
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,320
They're so lucky.

2834
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:39,440
They're so lucky.

2835
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:41,600
They're actually so lucky.

2836
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,320
Oh my god.

2837
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:48,720
Shield.

2838
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:50,040
It's shield time.

2839
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,580
Oh my god.

2840
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:59,150
Oh my god.

2841
01:55:59,290 --> 01:55:59,950
They're so low!

2842
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:01,810
That's it.

2843
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:02,410
I'm angry.

2844
01:56:04,370 --> 01:56:05,490
I'm angry.

2845
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:07,530
Second life.

2846
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:11,230
Second life.

2847
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:11,270
Second life.

2848
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,610
Second life.

2849
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:14,430
Bunker city containment system deactivated.

2850
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:14,930
Oh my god.

2851
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:18,650
I don't know how we're alive, but we're... I'm gonna take it.

2852
01:56:18,730 --> 01:56:19,410
Energy low.

2853
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:21,110
I'm available.

2854
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:22,790
Okay, it's fine.

2855
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:23,730
Rebuild!

2856
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,420
That's fucking right.

2857
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:30,380
That's right!

2858
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:33,860
That's fucking right!

2859
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:34,820
Energy low.

2860
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:36,060
Oh, you're low.

2861
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:37,700
See, you're low.

2862
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:39,960
Oh, I know you're low.

2863
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,000
I know you're low.

2864
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:43,860
Come on.

2865
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:45,180
He's so low.

2866
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:47,040
He actually is so low.

2867
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,260
Come on.

2868
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:49,660
No!

2869
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:53,940
He's so low.

2870
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:54,660
He's so low.

2871
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:55,480
That's the worst part.

2872
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,280
No.

2873
01:56:58,800 --> 01:56:58,960
No.

2874
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:00,740
I'm getting targeted so hard.

2875
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:01,760
Where's my team?

2876
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,500
Where was my team?

2877
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:10,320
What happened to my team?

2878
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:11,400
What happened to my team?

2879
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:16,280
There we go.

2880
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,140
Oh my god.

2881
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:17,820
We did it.

2882
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,600
We fucking did it.

2883
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:23,580
Where are they?

2884
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:25,520
Oh my god.

2885
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:26,280
You're so low.

2886
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:27,500
I'm gonna chase.

2887
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:29,900
Oh my god.

2888
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,520
Thank god.

2889
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:31,640
Thank god.

2890
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:33,260
We're getting it.

2891
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,040
Oh my god.

2892
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:40,060
We have our Tricera.

2893
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:40,920
That's right.

2894
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:41,740
Cut this out!

2895
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:42,480
Tricera!

2896
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:47,510
Gun- That's right!

2897
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:48,410
We beat you!

2898
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:54,710
That's right!

2899
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:58,630
Holy shit.

2900
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:00,310
I live!

2901
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:01,710
I live!

2902
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:01,930
I live!

2903
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:05,030
The Falcon Penis is no more!

2904
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:07,030
Holy fuck!

2905
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:09,510
Oh my god!

2906
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:10,050
No!

2907
01:58:10,230 --> 01:58:11,290
You deserve it!

2908
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:13,590
You deserve it!

2909
01:58:15,570 --> 01:58:17,330
The Tricera!

2910
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:18,710
The Tricera!

2911
01:58:19,790 --> 01:58:21,490
Clutched it for us!

2912
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:22,830
Let's go!

2913
01:58:23,150 --> 01:58:24,430
Jesus Christ!

2914
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:26,830
A million damage taken!

2915
01:58:26,830 --> 01:58:28,410
We take those!

2916
01:58:29,590 --> 01:58:31,410
We fucking take- You know what?

2917
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:33,430
That was a good time to call it.

2918
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:37,670
We- That match lasted so long!

2919
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:43,070
That we've actually hit the- We hit the endgame.

2920
01:58:43,330 --> 01:58:45,630
The Falcon Menace is no more!

2921
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:46,570
I-

2922
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:51,810
In and out of victory!

2923
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:55,030
We did it!

2924
01:58:55,650 --> 01:58:56,350
We did it!

2925
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:57,810
We've destroyed all Falcon players!

2926
01:58:58,650 --> 01:58:59,410
Oh my god!

2927
01:58:59,870 --> 01:59:01,030
The mosquitos are dead!

2928
01:59:01,190 --> 01:59:02,590
We swatted them down!

2929
01:59:02,990 --> 01:59:05,190
They said we couldn't, but we did it!

2930
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:08,630
We- Alright, everyone!

2938
01:59:37,050 --> 01:59:37,950
Alright, we're not doing that.

2939
01:59:38,110 --> 01:59:39,110

01:59:56,330 --> 01:59:57,110
Anyway, guys.

Um, I hope you guys were- managed to get your drops for those who are new here.

2947
02:00:11,450 --> 02:00:12,490
My name is DokiBird.

2948
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:17,050
I usually stream on YouTube, but today I was on Twitch for the Mecha Break, uh, sponsor.

2949
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:18,470
Um, so yeah.

2950
02:00:18,690 --> 02:00:20,130
Uh, please check me out over there.

2951
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:27,730
Um, you can follow me, uh, by, uh, doing exclamation point socials and, uh, follow me on Twitter if you want to know whenever I stream on Twitch.

2952
02:00:27,890 --> 02:00:29,310
I usually tweet out my Twitch streams.

2953
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:34,450
Um, if you want to support me via other means, uh, uh, feel free to buy my merch.

2954
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:37,550
I just recently had my birthday merch released on my website.

2955
02:00:37,550 --> 02:00:41,010
So, DokiMerch.com is a great way to support me as well.

Uh, but yes.

I hope everybody had a great time.

2958
02:00:43,690 --> 02:00:48,630
Um, as always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2959
02:00:48,830 --> 02:00:51,230
And if you, except for me, head to bed.

2960
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:52,730
Cause, you deserve it.

2961
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:54,910
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

02:00:55,710 --> 02:00:56,730
Uh, bye guys.

02:00:56,730 --> 02:00:57,710
Bye.

2964
02:00:57,710 --> 02:00:58,990
A little pause...
