adrenaline and everything i need um i need to like no there

33
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:50,140
it's youtube side that's so that sucks that um um uh that uh
what was I gonna say oh yeah it sucks that my last game

34
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:58,800
YouTube got hit got hit hard that was that was unfortunate
but what could you do at least the did the VOD survive I was

35
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,180
too scared to watch the VOD I watched a bit of the the
replay on oh the VOD is fine that's good I watched a bit of

36
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:14,440
the replay of the games themselves on on Seedog and
Aramouse's stream.

37
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,960
Let's see how people were thinking.

38
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:25,780
I also watched a little bit of Shoto's POV during that
unfortunate game that I had against them.

39
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,880
I need you guys to know, I was not, my hands were shaking
the entire time for that very first game.

40
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,400
I was not aiming at all.

41
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,580
Like, I'm surprised I hit any shots.

42
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,520
During that first game.

43
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,220
So, um, I don't know if you guys know that.

44
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,280
I think you guys could tell.

45
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:54,620
And then after that, um, after, uh, after the first game,
like, my aim, like, relaxed after that.

46
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
Um, it was fine after that, yeah.

47
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,220
Um, but like after the first game, I was fine with my aim.

48
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,560
Yo, you guys, you guys like how aggressive I was?

49
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,060
Because I, okay, like, I would never do this.

50
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,140
And, and if I was in my top 500.

51
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:20,480
lobby I would never been that aggressive but I knew I knew I
could out aim at least 70% of at least 70 to 80% of the

52
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:30,440
people in that tournament so I knew I could like even as
rocket as rocket too because like they don't expect the

53
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:38,200
rocket damage is actually insane rockets damage is insane up
close and no one ever expects the rocket to shoot back so

54
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,800
when I rock it all I was just like, that's right, bitch.

55
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,040
I was just like, I was like, get over here.

56
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:55,800
I fucking mowed down an entire tank into like, to zero HP is
crazy.

57
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,020
Uh, that's close.

58
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,980
But the thing is, I know I could get, I knew I could get
away with it in this tournament.

59
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:15,000
Um, but, um, I, I, I obviously in rank, in rank because um
all the fucking rank players like all the top 500 players

60
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,100
would fucking shit on me and shut me down but i knew i knew
like even as luna the moment i swapped the luna oh my god

61
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,460
luna feels so slow after i started playing gambit for those
who don't know luna is not meta anymore so that's why we

62
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:37,640
avoided playing luna um and we only had to play luna during
like certain scenarios like the storm vault you have to play

63
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:45,760
luna for storm vault um So, if she felt so slow when I was,
like, swapping to Gambit, like, aim-wise as well.

64
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:54,540
Like, it was so weird trying to aim on Luna because I'm not
used to aiming on Luna with, like, after playing Gambit for

65
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,180
so long.

66
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,240
Like, yeah, she's finally freed.

67
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,360
We're finally free.

68
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,900
Yeah, I was glad that...

69
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,660
Now you guys can see why I was fucking...

70
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:19,060
guys can tell see that i would like 1v1 other players and i
was that confident as as uh like there was i had so much

71
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:26,260
mobility it's actually crazy as gambit you can have so much
fucking ability you can see me like go in and then go out

72
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:38,200
and i'm still alive like that's why yeah and um um i use
gambit very aggressively the difference between a bad gambit

73
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:45,720
and like a good gambit is um you use your abilities
aggressively so you don't use it to heal you literally use

74
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:53,340
it to just anti things and like you just play as anna that's
really it um um and he's just like he like people are like

75
00:10:53,340 --> 00:11:00,780
oh he's the kierko he's he's the anna he's the anna of
marvel rivals so and he has you can see like how if you guys

110
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:46,980

and even winning the champ winning it all

111
00:14:50,260 --> 00:15:00,500
I almost dropped out because wait should I say that I almost
dropped out I literally had a breakdown last night because I

112
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:12,380
almost dropped out no I don't need to add that yet I'll tell
you guys the story okay Uh, dropping a little fun fact,

113
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:12,900
guys.

114
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,360
Uh, felt, yeah, I was, I'd fucking, I was like, I hope we
win one game.

115
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:25,180
I, because, like, I said, we literally, as a full team
together, like, with all six of us, we had two hours

116
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,340
together of all six of us.

117
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,440
And then, uh, five of us, we had four hours of practice.

118
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:40,080
But I literally saw some teams that were, like, um, in the
VC for two days, morning to night, for hours.

119
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,880
And I was like, oh, no, are we not practicing enough?

120
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,020
I was, like, so scared.

121
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,180
And I was like, oh, my gosh, oh.

122
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:57,300
And then, like, you know, I was like, oh, we don't have, you
know, we don't have a, we don't have, like, you know, like

123
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:07,000
an X-Pro DPS player or like, like, in a top 500 DPS player,
you know, or like in an X-Pro in different types of games or

124
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,200
anything or just like, you know, gifted, you know, you guys
can be like, oh, dokey but you got top 500 in like overwatch

125
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:20,940
and apex and stuff like that but like i play support now in
rivals and that is because like you know like i would see

126
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:29,140
like the enemy dps players like you know i would see sk or
like blur like like just walking around and i couldn't do

127
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:37,140
anything about it i have to like all i could do like i want
to shoot them but i mean i did shot blur a couple of times

128
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:45,240
and also SK a couple of times but it was very there were
also very risky moves to take for me as a support because

129
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:58,240
when I die my team doesn't get kills anymore so so um so
like it was very risky for me to to try and take those shots

130
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,100
to try and do one like like 1v1 against like the really,
really, really good DPS players.

131
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,540
So I was very nervous because we didn't, I guess like we
didn't, our team was just very, very well-rounded.

132
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,520
Like we were so lucky to have such an amazing combination.

133
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:29,100
Like even though it was like assigned, pre-assigned, our
team was just really good in terms of like, we're all just

134
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,120
good, well-rounded individuals.

135
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:38,060
that we could literally just play anything yeah like we
could play even though we're not all of our average was a

136
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:51,800
bit lower uh was a bit lower compared to others um um we
managed to like we were so flexible with everything yeah um

137
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:59,240
and you know i know i i had really good igls and stuff like
that i yeah oh my god i just watched the vod of them just i

138
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,880
sorry i accidentally had a vod of the the Shoto match and
then where the fuck did I come from where I just suddenly

139
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:13,460
fucking killed the Magneto I don't know like I just saw
Magneto die now like where the like by me I was like where

140
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:27,500
the fuck did I come from like I'm sorry yeah yeah I was like
yeah fuck you muted like fear what bitch like fear this

141
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:46,100
um um any any oh wait whoa the muted situation was crazy
yeah yeah yeah heavenly was our secret weapon regarding like

142
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:55,840
the flex uh being the flex like actual dp by the way he was
he was he was the role he chose was dps um he was like my

143
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,840
first choice is dps but we're but he was the strongest tank
player in our entire team so we're like we're putting on

144
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:11,480
tank um um because like obviously our other dps player was
melee only so you know when they started playing flyers when

145
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:19,660
they started fucking playing flyers we were like oh shit
okay swap what are you gonna do punch them from the sky yeah

146
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,260
that ain't season one iron fist bro like yeah

147
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:36,860

153
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,460
DPS player so like he could just play other hitscans like he
was a hitscan projectile DPS player like he was our non

154
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:33,100
melee character so it didn't matter if they Target band,
Hawkeye, because he could still play, you know, he could

155
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:46,580
still fucking play, like, the other gun shooty DPS play,
DPS, yeah, um, uh, so, yeah, I'm just, I'm really fucking,

156
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:57,060
uh, proud of my team for it, um, I, bro, like, the amount
of, like, I literally woke up, five, uh, I woke up at, like,

157
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:06,980
10, a.m yeah i woke up at 10 a.m and started researching
today because i started researching um my teams because like

158
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:14,140
uh started researching all the like all the enemy teams and
stuff because okay this is like really fucked up but like um

159
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,860
i know like others were doing the same like there was a lot
of money on the line too and like you know uh others were

160
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:26,120
also doing something so i assume others were doing something
similar because i saw people private their profiles um after

161
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:34,580
joining the But like, I know it's like pretty messed up, but
it's research.

162
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,760
I like, that's, I find this fun.

163
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:46,620
I find the strategizing and trying, like, trying to figure
out, like, what to play against.

164
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,940
Because that's, that's literally competitive.

165
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,040
Like, you can say, like, oh, it's for fun.

166
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,340
But like, that's, it's still competitive in a way.

167
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,580
Like, it's still a competitive environment.

168
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,100
yeah i did for the love of the game but and i love i love
like the strategies and like strategize because it's rock

169
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:14,340
paper scissors bandline is rock paper scissors um if you get
a good bandline you fucking win the game so uh so like what

170
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:22,700
i did basically i don't know i think i said it before but i
looked up everybody's profiles like one by one because they

171
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:32,780
uh gave us access to uids um and I looked it up one by one
and then all the ones that had their profiles open I looked

172
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:44,200
at history and then I see all the comps they played together
in the six stack so that's that's literally what I did and

173
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:53,520
um so and then like also if they are open I see what they
mean I just look at what they made and see the thing is this

174
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:02,280
is what my bad line was I look for players I look for
players who have been who are newer in the game and if

175
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:11,100
they're playing important This is why our team was the only
team that banned Emma because from my research Um, this is

176
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:18,440
the only reason why our like though other all the other
teams they didn't ban Emma What I noticed because, uh, they

177
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:29,420
had their profiles open was that I realized Um, I realized
that they only they only had time to learn one new character

178
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:38,340
and emma their only tank player learned all they did was
learn emma for like their and their second most played tank

179
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:52,180
was mag with 11 minutes so they i noticed that oh wait
they're only their main only tank player and you guys

180
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:59,260
remember in the VOD in the VOD where uh where they were like
where I was like guys read what my discord message because

181
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:07,540
we were watching we were watching uh we were watching dubie
and amelie's I think it was like yeah dubie versus amelie

182
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:21,400
and then uh amelie versus uh uh fuck oh my gosh my mind is
blurring together who is the 13 this who is the 13 guys it

183
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,960
was uh Shoto.

184
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,260
It was Amalee versus Shoto.

185
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:32,300
And what I typed in the Discord was like, do you notice how
they are playing one tank and their one tank is their Emma

186
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,760
player?

187
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,260
Like...

188
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,320
So my brain is like frazzled right now because I've been
doing a lot of thinking.

189
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,960
And that was why I was typing in the Discord server.

190
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,480
And I was like, don't be afraid.

191
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,700
They're literally playing one tank and their one tank is
their Emma one trick.

192
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,560
And that's why I banned Emma You know how I got this strat?

193
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:01,840
Because fucking XQC during the XQC tournament, Target Band
Tyler won.

194
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,840
Despite our team being incredibly stacked.

195
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,220
And all Tyler won did.

196
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,640
Great guy.

197
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,360
Very funny.

198
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:22,080
But all he did on Hulk when we did a D1 XQC, Target Band are
poor new player who can only play Venom.

199
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:39,740
He targeted Ben Tyler 1 We were We won a majority of our
games XQC lost all his games We went to knockout stages And

200
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:52,160
XQC's team Knocked us out Because they realized Wait Tyler 1
can only play Venom And then we had to put Tyler 1 On Hulk

201
00:25:52,180 --> 00:26:01,640
and he fucking fed his ass off and then we got knocked out
we were the favorites to get first or second and then we got

202
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,500
knocked out and from that was where I learned my lesson

203
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:25,760
this was where I realized this was the strat because my team
was like no we shouldn't Emma, we have to ban Hella and

204
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,780
Siloc.

205
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,900
I was like, no, you don't understand.

206
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,860
It was a life lesson.

207
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,320
That what he did to us was a fucking life lesson.

208
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:42,200
And then after we got knocked out by XKC's team, when we
were the favorites, like instantly gone.

209
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,380
It was like group stages and we got he lost every game.

210
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,700
We won every game.

211
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
So we're like, this is easy.

212
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,700
You know, like, oh, we're against the team that lost every
game.

213
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,500
Like, we're supposed to win this and then he they realized
wait we can target bad tyler one because that's their second

214
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:13,820
tank and then everything fell apart because it became a 5v6
because tyler one had to learn an entire new tank during

215
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:22,480
that during that one that like live on that game uh So my
team was like, no, no, bad Hela Silos, because they were

216
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,180
very scary.

217
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,660
Because we don't want to deal with Namor Team Up with Hela.

218
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,240
And also, we don't want to deal with SK Silos.

219
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,400
And I was like, no, guys, we have to ban Emma.

220
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,020
You don't understand.

221
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,920
Their main tank player can only play Emma.

222
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,740
At the moment we take that away from him, their entire front
line collapses.

223
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,090
I was like, you don't understand.

224
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,590
Like, and then they're like, and I pulled up the excuse me
thing.

225
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,390
It happened to me in this tournament.

226
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,910
You don't understand.

227
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,110
I literally got knocked off because of that.

228
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,550
Like,

229
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,800
I was like, we have to do this.

230
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,060
Like, yeah.

231
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,380
Yeah, so.

232
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:31,700
so like because you know having you know they lost their
main tank so like the the the strat was just basically by

233
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:40,020
losing their main tank because it's very hard to learn a new
character after spending hours on the one tank you know the

234
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:50,840
one character that you were told to learn uh for the last
two days and suddenly bam the band went in like so so it

235
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,940
essentially becomes a 5v6.

236
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,540
Okay, also, the other thing was that I was going to try and
ban Hella too after that.

237
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,040
I was going to be like Emma Hella because I was like, let's
give SK SILOC because I feel bad because like she was Target

238
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,240
banned the entire time.

239
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,640
And then obviously my team was like, don't do that, bro.

240
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,940
You're like, because like, you know, Yannirs has only played
Hella the entire time.

241
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,940
And I was like, bro, let's just let SK play SILOC, man.

242
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,880
She got Target banned.

243
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,920
And then my team was like, no, that's bullying you're gonna
you're bullying the two new players for my batting their new

244
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:32,580
their characters and i was like but i just want to give
eskade siloed and that's why i was like let's gotcha it guys

245
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:44,940
let's but then but then we got domination i was like no
gotcha i ain't fighting siloed on domination i okay it was

246
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:52,740
because we were guaranteed in the final so at that point i
didn't care whether we I was like, no, I don't want to die

247
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,980
to Scylok on domination because domination is the best map
for Scylok So I was like, no, I was gonna be nice, but never

248
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:08,440
mind I was just like I I just hated playing domination with
Scylok like against Scylok I was just like, I'm sorry the

249
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,540
map picked the map didn't want me like

250
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,640
Yeah, that one map changed my entire my entire career Hmm

251
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:34,460
yeah um jacquardo thank you super chat thank you thank you
some may underestimate dokey coming out with big brain

252
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,320
stress because they don't expect research mode dokey but
when it's rival she uses 110 of the brain thank you super

253
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,960
chat i think i could be i i don't think i actually no i
don't think i'm a good analyst honestly i had a lot of help

254
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:53,860
from um figuring out how to analyze situations um from other
pro players just watching pros and like just talking to

255
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:01,220
other pro players and also like talking to like the managers
of uh pro teams so it helped a lot trying to figure because

256
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:08,840
like you know i was very undecided about some things so like
so like they helped me a lot when they um when they were

257
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:15,300
like teaching me how to analyze the situation because i also
didn't play this season a lot that's also because like like

258
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:26,640
i literally started this season three days ago I I literally
started this season three days ago so I was like not not

259
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,360
like not like very informed like I wasn't very informative
of like what to fucking swap you know like I was like do I

260
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:41,420
do this or do I do that like because I was very like I'm
very proud of my team for being able to like think for

261
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:49,120
themselves about counterswapping too so I'm glad that they
also thought for themselves as well um and being able to

262
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:57,840
like because when i don't know what to counter swap i was
just like just they they were like i'll do this then but i

263
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,280
did like i did like been more pro i was very proactive in
the end about counter swapping because like i didn't want

264
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,940
people them to hesitate because i was like we got i like i
was just like guys come on guys we got we got we have to

265
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:21,740
like think really fast because i like the thing about me
because i have the game a top 500 hiring player so um um you

266
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:28,480
know we our duty as like especially a support player we have
to react fast basically we have to react and think very fast

267
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,920
about the situation because like one second can cost like
the entire game so i have to like be like i actually have to

268
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:43,260
take control about the swapping be like swap now swap that
swap now swap this like i was like he's I was like, he's

269
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:43,520
Moon Knight.

270
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,980
Go, go back to spawn room and go get off of Loki.

271
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,300
And then the user was like, wait, right now?

272
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,580
Like, the game's like, yes, right now.

273
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,600
Yes, right now.

274
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,840
Get off of Loki.

275
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,060
Like, I don't care if you have...

276
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,360
Yeah, I realized, like, after the first map, I had to be
more...

277
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,060
I have to be more proactive with calling for swaps and
stuff.

278
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:24,140
It's because, like, I am also used to it for, you know, I
started playing competitive in Overwatch, and Overwatch was

279
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,860
all about counterswapping, and so you had to think fast.

280
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,400
And then Apex, it's all about rotations and everything.

281
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,000
And so that taught me about, like, rotations and, like,
positioning and stuff.

282
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:43,600
And so, like, combining those two into rivals, Helped out a
lot.

283
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,040
I was really impressed with how you're able to micromanage
just enough to wrangle your team.

284
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,560
Yeah, it's very hard on Gambit because Gambit has a lot of
things to do.

285
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:02,420
So like my brain was actually on fucking overtime trying to
figure out like what to Like what to say what to do on

286
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:10,720
Gambit only because like I have like 50 other buttons to
play use like and like be aware of my surroundings too.

287
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:19,560
Okay, but yeah out um i'm glad i was able to play gambit
because i don't know if you guys noticed but gambit is a

288
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:27,300
very very broken like i literally got to okay you guys do
notice because i always i'm so humbled but i sort of talk

289
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:35,060
about it a bit you know you know i sort of talk about it
here and there but you know how i got top 500 in two days by

290
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:48,700
playing gambit yeah but he is so good on um he is he is the
best support character like in this game and i'm there's no

291
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:57,000
way they're keeping him like that and there's no way they're
keeping him like that though because rank one two three four

292
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:08,680
and five currently is literally one guy one pro player who
just plays gambit and he got rank one two three and four and

293
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:16,840
five right now and his play style is basically i basically
took my play style is basically his play style i took how

294
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:30,540
i've analyzed how he plays and i just played like him yeah
that's that's how fucking broken gambit is at the moment

295
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:36,340
yeah His name is Saipay, but yeah, he's like rank 1 to 5 at
the moment on Gambit.

296
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,600
So, that's why you see how aggressive, like, I do heal.

297
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,020
Like, I'd never use my heals.

298
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,000
You can tell that I'd never use my healing cards.

299
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,500
And all I did was just anti-people over and over again.

300
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,500
Because, like, his primary heal is just so strong already.

301
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,100
So, like, it doesn't, like, he doesn't need to use his cards
to heal.

302
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,680
because it takes fucking forever to charge.

303
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,860
It's a good...

304
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,100
I'm actually having a lot of fun playing Gambit, too.

305
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,140
Yeah, his anti-heal is just way too strong to use it for
anything else.

306
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,800
Like I said, it's just Anna.

307
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,240
It's just really Anna.

308
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,000

He left after an hour or two.

endurance battlefield stream.

358
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,900
It still counts.

359
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,660

There you go.

365
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,420
No dinner because Jolly Bee was gone.

closed, sad face.

367
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,800
I love the air that you would see.

368
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,880
Oh my gosh, I'm so tired.

369
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,600
My eyes actually, like, feel so heavy.

370
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,940
I think it's like, I'm not tired.

371
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,480
I think I'm, like, I'm not, like, physically tired.

372
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,480
I'm, like, mentally tired.

373
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,600
I think that that's it.

374
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,320
I don't physically feel tired.

375
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,660
I'm just mentally so exhausted.

376
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,420
From, because I had to use...

377
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:46,080
so much of my brain power to play that entire tournament
because I was, you know, I was watching some of the other

378
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,160
streams.

379
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:59,880
I think my biggest advantage was that I have so much
experience in tournaments that like I know how to lead a

380
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,760
team in terms of like IGLing because I have so much
experience

381
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:16,100
rank lobbies that like um um it gave our team an advantage
because then we knew what to do like we had a plan each time

382
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:23,900
we don't hesitate to so like that was like our one of our
big because i was watching like the other like i was

383
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:33,000
watching like i think like two of the povs i didn't i didn't
watch dubie's pov for like her matches but um like the there

384
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:40,920

as a team on what to do and what not to do but for me i was

385
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:48,260
like no we're doing this you know they're like do it yeah i

was like don't all everyone do not all but like yeah yeah

387
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,920
i'll be like uh uh i was like Yuzu, don't come out.

388
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,840
Keep hiding.

389
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,500
Yeah, because I know Yuzu wants to join the fight.

390
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,500
And I was like, Yuzu, don't come out of the hole.

391
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,680
Keep fucking hiding.

392
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,820

and he was doing individual coaching for anyone that wanted

397
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,820

402
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:47,300
Luna, oh, because I didn't see her all, I didn't realize she
all did, because I think I was dead, um, so I saved my all,

403
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:56,860
because I was waiting for her to all, um, and then I tapped,

And I didn't expect to marry all the fans and even winning
it all.

There's more, by the way, to it.

508
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:52,030
I have, like...

509
00:53:52,050 --> 00:54:01,170
one where it's like our main comps what do we play when they
do this but i'll show you this oh yeah let's see actually

510
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:17,810
okay uh oh yeah let me double check everything i wrote here

511
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:23,150
you go here you go team show though release the documents.

512
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:24,850
These are our bandline.

513
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,350
They also have a strong sidelock.

514
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:31,450
Here's our, this is what I posted in, so I just look at it
whenever.

515
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:35,750
And these are like, they have an band, I was like, what maps
are Angela?

516
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:36,690
You know?

517
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:44,490
And then, and then there's like, Dubee's team.

518
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:51,410
The Dubee files, yeah, and then here you go.

519
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:57,230
Here's our band during scrims because they did a scrim they
did a scrim against like uh but i should have told them like

520
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:02,070
they're fucking around like uh and these are not the actual
comps you're playing because i know their quick play comps

521
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:10,470
were their real comps um they did a scrim like uh dubie and
shoto scrimmed each other and uh and uh but they were

522
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:16,590
fucking around with their comps for it and also their band
lied so i knew that this wasn't a real comps and i looked at

523
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:20,710
the quick play and that's where i found the real comps
because i was like yeah like if they're six stacking quick

524
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:32,110
play real comps because it was consistent and then so I was
like Hela's main band and Penny obviously we swapped that

525
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:41,010
around later I swapped that around later after that because
I was just like oh we later were like we banned Bucky Hela

526
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:49,070
because we realized at first we're like all of them could
play Penny and then we're like oh wait no Bucky Hela is a

527
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:57,390
better strat just because like we saw we saw, you know,
because luckily, Duby was the first, Duby and Amalie were

528
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:00,050
the, was the first team to play against each other.

529
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:07,710
So, we noticed that Blur was really good at Bucky, so we
swapped our band line, or I swapped the band line, and was

530
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:12,310
like, okay, we banned Tella and Bucky.

531
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,470
And, at first we wanted to ban Groot, because we realized
they only played Groot.

532
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,450
They really only played Groot.

533
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:26,570
So, then I was just like, but so that was like, we're doing
the same thing as like bad Emma because that's the only

534
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,350
thing they play.

535
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,230
But then we're like, oh, it's fine.

536
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:37,310
Like their DPS is a lot scarier than like, because their
tanks can swap to something else, even though they have to

537
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,830
swap to, uh, they have to swap to, uh, DPS.

538
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:46,350
But, um, we just realized just Bucky, we don't want to deal
with Bucky up because we have a Loki.

539
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:52,290
And also like, you know, they had to play Moon night to
counter our Loki and we so we're like we have to ban Bucky

540
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:57,830
because you know he's just gonna farm our clones and we're
like hell out we don't want to deal with a team up because

541
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:03,850
we notice how good they are at the team up so we don't have
a hell up and a name more player um and this was our second

542
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:19,230
one here that's uh so yeah ban Emma yeah that's they have a
player that only knows how to Emma.

543
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,760
There it is.

544
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:34,500
And then my team argued against it and was like, um, my team
was like, no, don't ban Emma.

545
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,620
We have to ban Hella.

546
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,420
We have to ban Hella because it's scarier.

547
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,060
The name where team up is scary.

548
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,620
I was like, no, I played these games before.

549
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:50,300
I, I was like, I play these.

550
00:57:50,620 --> 00:58:03,900
got knocked out because my one trick could only play venom
and we were the favorites and we got knocked out by the by

551
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:15,880
the last place team because they banned my one trick i was
not having history repeat itself

552
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,280
I was like, get rid of the front line.

553
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:37,260
So my strat was to get rid of the front line because like I
said, when the front line falls, everything falls.

554
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,740
Thank you, Pat.

555
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:47,560
Thank you, XQC, for giving me enough trauma to do this to
someone else.

556
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,620
I continue the cycle.

557
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:58,360
I continue this cycle.

558
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,000
I can't give me.

559
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,010
I'm making the tweet.

560
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,540

Okay, so I almost dropped out of the, obviously, the whole,
I mean, that's basically the whole story.

605
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,210
I almost dropped out of the tournament because I was so
stressed out.

606
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,130
And like, I've been very stressed out the last.

going on last minute and a lot of people being um replaced

608
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:55,070
and everything and then i felt so bad because um i didn't
also i didn't really want to be captain i didn't want to be

609
01:02:55,070 --> 01:03:01,130
captain at all um because like you know i feel like if we
could make our own name instead of being like team dokeybird

610
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:08,090
you know like that would be less stressful but it was like
team dokeybird i represent the entire team and then you know

611
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:14,750
i and the fact that i had to do like the interviews and
everything and like and like i knew it because i was captain

612
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:21,470
i have to do the interviews and stuff so it was like so much
and there was so much so many eyes on me like literally when

613
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:27,330
they announced it everyone was like dokeybird's gonna sweep
the entire tournament and everything and there was so much

614
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:33,590
pressure on me because everyone knows that i'm like the
marvel rivals youtuber and so like but then i got really

615
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:47,450
nervous because when we were seeing when we got our team
thing when we got the team list um uh um i was very worried

616
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:55,590
because like i said it was 70 support players so a lot of
people had to offer and we didn't really have like you know

617
01:03:55,590 --> 01:04:06,730
like pure tank players so people that's why that's also why
i was so aggressive i um i got like that's why i was so

618
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:14,070
aggressive because i knew a lot of people are off rolling so
like even the tanks so i knew like an actual tank player

619
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:25,530
would fucking shut me down instantly um so but i knew i was
like you're off rolling you know i was like you you're

620
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:34,270
off-rolling i'm coming for you like that's i was just like i
was like fighting everyone because i knew they were

621
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:46,050
off-rolling um so i was not scared because they don't they
don't know their uh their full potential as that character

622
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:54,450
because if you saw me fucking go up against the strange you
know what i'm told at i'm like told that like never as a

623
01:04:54,450 --> 01:05:01,450
support player never try not even as a support or dps player
you're never supposed to do a 1v1 against the strange

624
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:07,370
because the strange will always win the fight but i was like
you were off bro like i know you don't know how to kill me

625
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:25,260
like so i'm also like funnish here too because i was like i
know you don't know how to kill me bro i so so that's why i

626
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,940
was so fucking aggressive because I knew a lot of the people
were off-rolling.

627
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,040
So, and same with my team.

628
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,360
Like I said, we didn't really have a tank player.

629
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,900
But Balina was a melee DPS player.

630
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:48,660
He mostly plays, like, he mostly plays all, like, Iron Fist
and Mr. Fantastic, which is a crazy hero pool.

631
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:54,960
Like, so we had to stick Heavenly onto tank.

632
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,220
was our DPS player as well.

633
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:08,620
But we realized that a lot of lower, low ranked players or
like, you know, the rank disparity of players, they don't

634
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:11,520
know how to play against Iron Fist and Mr. Fantastic.

635
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,380
So especially an Iron Fist that has a team supporting him.

636
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:20,000
That's why, and because teams already struggle with
Daredevil, like if he knew Daredevil, it would have been

637
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,360
perfect.

638
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:24,580
But if he knew Daredevil, it would have been so fucking not
fair.

639
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:40,880
um because daredevil is like the fucking um the fucking most
broken dps character right now in in rivals um uh but like

640
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:47,560
even then like there's also like it um if they knew like
they just need a bucky to counter that's why we were banning

641
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:59,840
bucky too because bucky counters uh iron fist as well um um
so so i was you know i was really nervous about it because

642
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:12,180
um um a lot of the other teams they had really really good
dps players um that were like you know um that were like

643
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:20,880
even if they are not even their ranking rivals isn't high
they've like peaked higher in different games and um or they

644
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:28,340
have like a higher rank average our rank average was not
that high uh like you know user literally learned the game

645
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:36,460
two days like not learn the learn the game but literally um
try to pick up the game two days ago um i mean she i think

646
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:42,600
she played quick play before when the game first came out
but you know she didn't play a lot she was unranked like she

647
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:50,280
ranked like she got into rank like two days ago and
everything um so she had like i had to coach her and kick

648
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:58,120
you on how to play support because during the first scrims i
had to like guide them on support like how to support all

649
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:05,280
and everything because during the scrim yuzu um i don't know
if this was during the tournament was this i don't remember

650
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:13,960
it was a tournament or the scrim but she didn't know when
she didn't know which characters was uh which character

651
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:24,720
which copy on loki for loki was uh um for sorry i'm
remembering straddle was for aggressive alt and which copy

652
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:31,380
was for defensive alt so i had to teach her that because
like she was using luna all aggressively i was just like no

653
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:40,720
that's her only defense song you do stop so i was like don't
do that again you do like He was just like, I was like,

654
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,540
okay, I'm gonna cop.

655
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,060
I was like, okay, we're gonna copy.

656
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,720
We're gonna use it defensively.

657
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,400
And then she copied Luna and like ran into the enemy team.

658
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,560
And I was like, our only defense.

659
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,640
And then she's like, sorry, I tell you.

660
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,920
Cause like, you know, before then she was copying.

661
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,800
She was copying me nonstop.

662
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,520
And I always play the aggressive of it.

663
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,440
But I was like, don't copy.

664
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:08,760
Because, and I had to swap to, I had to swap to Rocket, I
think.

665
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:17,460
because of the comp and and so she i was like copy luna you
have to copy luna don't copy me and so she thought that

666
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:24,560
because i was like don't copy rocket you know i was just
like luna was just better than rocket so i was a teacher and

667
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:33,680
be like okay um just copy our luna but but and use it
defensively but then and she was like oh i i don't know

668
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,460
which character is like afterwards you know after she's like
sorry i didn't know which one's defensive i was like

669
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:47,740
aggressively but that's it like everything else defensively
so so from there i was like that like and then also kikyo

670
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:52,760
like i said i was coaching our support players because
obviously you know i have more of the game sense and

671
01:09:52,760 --> 01:10:00,040
knowledge i had to teach kikyo to be like uh i'm lucky that
no one know how to play phoenix um in the tournament but i

672
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:06,260
wasn't sure sure because well i know like blur can play
phoenix because he's like versatile and also sk i know blur

673
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:14,960
and sk and you ought to play phoenix but was like okay uh at
first kikio would throw rocket alts into phoenix alts like

674
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:23,460
when we you know because it's like stuff like this like if
you know the enemy team has a phoenix um you you don't alt

675
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:30,500
it's like playing chicken like that's how you have to play
against phoenix when you're rocket so i was just like so at

676
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:36,720
first she like altered she altered before knowing we knew
phoenix has alt but she still altered so i was just like

677
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:43,740
during the scrims so i was just like quickly was like yeah
don't do that like next time you play chicken you hold your

678
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:50,260
rocket all until and because i don't trust my team to shoot
the phoenix because we were literally we came together in

679
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:58,560
two days i don't think we were that coordinated to shoot the
fucking phoenix all um so i was just like i was like okay we

680
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:05,920
just wait until the phoenix all then you all next time like
stuff like that i was giving like like for me this is very

681
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:14,200
common knowledge for me because you know if i don't do it i
get yelled at and i'll start crying um i get yelled at by my

682
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:20,920
team and then i'm gonna start crying so i had to go through
that you know so but so that's why it's common knowledge for

683
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:32,180
me but like you know a lot of these players are not in my
rank um my rank to like have that being yelled at them yeah

684
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:42,340
so so i had to like teach them and be like yeah just make
sure to do this and yeah we learn when we cry yeah so um i

685
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:52,740
had to like guide them along on um but our team average was
actually quite low um because like you know like i said even

686
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:58,200
though i'm considered one above all i'm still a support
player so as a support player i know like you're like oh but

687
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:09,460
you guys you kept everyone but also like I think what helped
me was I could be any role if I was DPS or tank if I was DPS

688
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:19,740
or tank and I was one above all DPS or tank and I was also
IGLing I could get like 40 kills or like you know like 30

689
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:27,800
plus final hits as a tank or DPS and also IGL which would
leave a much bigger impact for my team.

690
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:37,340
But as support, all I could really do is just give them
knowledge, give them comms, and just keep them alive enough

691
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:46,320
to enable them to do as much as they can through the
knowledge and the damn brag.

692
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,540
No, it's true.

693
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,180
It's true.

694
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,120
You want to know why?

695
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:55,260
Because Super Gomez had the ring for Heavenly because he
couldn't show up yet.

696
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:05,160
yesterday for scrims and like we when we won our first game
he had 30 he was like IGLing for us and he had 30 final hits

697
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:21,500
and 30 plus final hits and IGLing for us and like we won
against a um we were scrimming against a uh yeah and then I

698
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:30,440
was like please play more like heaven lean like not gonna
get 30 plus final hits on tank bro you gotta play more like

699
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:43,220
a diamond player like yeah i was like bro uh you gotta play
more like a diamond player bro he's not gonna be doing the

700
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,840
shit you're doing, man.

701
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,920
It's very, it's so poor.

702
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:51,500
Yeah, they are.

703
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,460
They're very important.

704
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:57,720
But I would have a much bigger impact as a DPS and tank.

705
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,480
Because, like, I was a one above all DPS player.

706
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:07,840
Also, I wouldn't do, I would try not to do, like, I would be
like, pop, pop.

707
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,360
Maybe sitting, sort of fade off and teach your teammates.

708
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:31,240
thinking for a super chat thinking this ain't a realistic
scenario yeah um um yeah so uh so i was really worried

709
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:36,600
because like i got really worried because like i said i saw
the team averages and everything and we had like you know we

710
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,600
had diamond plays we had diamond play we

711
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:51,280
two diamond players we had two diamond players two celestial
play celestial three and then celestial two at me and then

712
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:59,760
we had an underrank and there's some teams that had like uh
two eternities two celestias and a plat and there was like

713
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:08,340
one that was like gm but i know you're you're very good at
dps like i don't remember the average for that but um the

714
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,900
like and then there's also an eternity player, GM player,
celestial player.

715
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:20,540
Like, it was, I got really worried because, like, um, the
second highest, that's, like, I got really worried for, for,

716
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,120
like, our team.

717
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,220
And then everyone's practicing, like, Mornington.

718
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,220
Like, everyone was practicing so much.

719
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:31,520
I saw everyone just hanging out in the VC, and I'm like, oh,
shit, is it bad that we're not hanging out in the VC?

720
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,120
Also, I joined the server late, too, so that was my fault as
well.

721
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,800
There were a lot of things that were my fault.

722
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:48,900
Um, so, Because like, we could have had three days of
practice, but our team had two days because I joined the

723
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:49,660
server late.

724
01:15:52,900 --> 01:16:02,160
So as captain, I didn't organize stuff in time for my team
because I joined the server technically like almost a day

725
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:02,460
late.

726
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:08,240
So other teams had three days of practice and my team had
two days of practice because of that.

727
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,820
Okay, it was my fault and I felt so bad.

728
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:14,340
I like apologized and everything.

729
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:20,760
I'm like, I'm sorry for causing such an issue and such a
commotion about it But it was whether or not I wanted to be

730
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:27,980
captain or not because I didn't want to be captain I didn't
want the responsibility.

731
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:36,340
So I joined the server late because me and the organizers
were trying to figure out if I wanted to be captain or not

732
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:55,120
it's so so that's why i enjoyed this i felt so bad because i
was like i didn't want the responsibility i was so scared

733
01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:03,640
and nervous and like so much pressure and um it wasn't the
highest rank though there's players that were higher ranked

734
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:13,960
that were captain what are you talking about in some of the
think like the other three teams it wasn't based on rank

735
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:21,960
what are you guys talking about the other three teams
weren't even based on rank but mine was so i was i was like

736
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:28,200
that's why i didn't that's why i had that whole discussion
with guys like i don't want to be captain because like like

737
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:35,640
if i lose they'll be like team donkey bird and then i have
to go to a loser's interview and i was just like bro i don't

738
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:41,660
know what the mental state right now they go guys no you
don't understand i know you you're like oh well but others

739
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:49,940
had to lose they were okay with you know doing those
interviews but guys i don't i was already like not okay like

740
01:17:49,940 --> 01:18:02,420
i was just not okay you know like no it was just like i was
i had a lot of stuff going on and i was like super stressed

741
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:12,780

stuff going on and I was just like Pro I'm I'm I don't know

742
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:21,640
I don't want this to be another minus one Like minus one in
stress or plus one plus one in stress So that's why I was

743
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:30,040

breaking because that was it was at the no it was sorry

747
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:09,280
battlefield yeah and then the fact that it took a six out
that was the day the six plus hours of battlefield was the

748
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:17,900
day i crashed out and had a breakdown about whether or not i
should drop out like that was that day because i was like i

749
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:30,660
played battlefield it took us six plus hours to win and then
the day before that i fucked up 385 percent like rules in

750
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,480

So, I was like, this close.

754
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,920
And a huge shout out to the organizers.

because they're like, you want to talk to Seedog?

760
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:02,920

782
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:37,000
it's a team game it's oh it is overall a team game and i
think each of them individually played a part in the victory

783
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:43,900
like each had their own fucking moments that clutched it up
for everyone um you know they they all had their insane

784
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:51,380
plays and they all had their own plays that won us certain
maps or certain points and everything um so yeah no they

785
01:22:51,380 --> 01:23:00,360
they like i i'm sorry for doubting my team i i'm sorry for
doubting myself i was doubting myself because i was like i

786
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:08,260
was i was like what if i felt so bad because they're like oh
i brought up my team average you know um i was like oh no i

787
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:14,940
i brought up my team average i was gonna feel so fucking bad
if we lose because of me um because you know i was like oh

788
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:22,920
you guys could have got like a better player than me like or
like an actual high ranker dps player or high rank tank

789
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:39,420
player so um so i'm just really proud of them um um i know
some oh my gosh i saw like um i'm glad they did balance

790
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:49,260
stuff again even though it was last minute because like um
alma lee's team was originally gonna have like uh another

791
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:56,480
eternity support player versus like because like versus like
uh because like sk was supposed to be on a different that's

792
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:02,040
why there were so many like swaps and changes because sk was
supposed to be on another team and alma lee was was gonna be

793
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:09,780
like have like another eternity support player but they
swapped it up uh and gave at the like i think it was like uh

794
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:18,740
three days before the tournament and put sk on amelis team
um and i think that definitely helped balance it a lot more

795
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:24,940
too so i mean they did a lot of swaps and stuff but yeah sk
was originally not even gonna be on amelis team because of

796
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:37,640
um because like i think i i i think like some people brought
it up too where like um um amelis team needs player oh yeah

797
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:45,620
i remember i remember i told you guys i was like bro some
teams have five support players and one tank i remember when

798
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:54,460
i said that chat i was like bro what the fuck there's one
that's that was amalese team i was like bro bro this team

799
01:24:54,460 --> 01:25:03,440
has five support players and one tank bro i was just like
and then they yeah and then and then they later on they like

800
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:10,560
swapped sk onto that team to give them a dps player because
because i think like some people were like yeah that's like

801
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:17,860
rough yeah i remember now i was like bro that's fucking
rough buddy

802
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:39,000
yeah uh yeah so i was just like oh my god uh The healer,
he'll stop for the win.

803
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,920
So I'm glad they did that.

804
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,740
I thought Amelie's team was so strong.

805
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,480
I honestly, I think they had a lot of really, really close
games.

806
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,240
I think the issue was just counterswapping.

807
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:57,820
Like I said, Amelie's team was very, very strong in general.

808
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:58,820
Like on paper.

809
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,680
They were very strong on paper, and a lot of us were very
scared.

810
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:17,860
very scared um because of it i think it's just more so of uh
of just like it's just counter counter swapping rock paper

811
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:25,340
scissors it's literally that um they just it just had to be
like they just and also the fact that we all target bond to

812
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:32,220
silo because we are not dealing with that every team was
balanced in the end yeah

813
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:44,740
about balancing and stuff um so i'm glad like every uh team
was balanced that was my biggest worry that's why i almost

814
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:53,760
dropped out too because i was like oh my gosh like i don't
know if this is balanced so like i was just like i don't

815
01:26:53,760 --> 01:27:01,300
know i don't know if it's gonna be balanced because
everyone's playing off-rolls and stuff and i don't know what

816
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,640
their skill level is and

817
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:18,940
um um but i know that's that's basically it i'm i'm i'm
happy with how uh everything came out in the end you know i

818
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:26,580
was expecting the worst possible outcome but then you know
it's always nice to be pleasantly surprised that's why i was

819
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:31,420
expect i don't know i know like i have like you know It's
like, like, what is it called?

820
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,000
What is it called?

821
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,020
Debbie Downer, you know, the typical Debbie Downer shit.

822
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:40,960
But like, I don't want to go in with high expectations
because I don't want to be disappointed.

823
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,020
I don't want to be disappointed.

824
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,120
So I'm glad things were down.

825
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,800
Pleasantly, you mean like fucking first place?

826
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:56,240

869
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:44,720

than mine right now um uh you'll finally get the i don't

870
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:57,100
think i will i think i'll just be still very confused uh uh
uh i think it was super chat thank you but and also we have

871
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:05,520
a sponsor next week and after that i don't know what was the
stuff with my schedule i'll figure it out later um um what

872
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,500
else oh there was something else i want to talk about i'm
trying to run oh also i want to say i'm really proud of my

873
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:18,980
team for being incredibly flexible and we didn't really have
one tricks it was i will say um it was very hard to fucking

874
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:32,300
figure out what the fuck to do with our limited when Loki
didn't work because Yuzu's hero pool was basically like what

875
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:38,280
Yuzu's hero pool was she can only play four supports because
she had two days to learn four supports which is already

876
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:45,420
really good she like okay three days maybe I don't know I
know I knew like she had two to three days to learn as many

877
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:51,240
supports as possible and she learned but at that time
because I was a day late, uh, because I was a day late to

878
01:32:51,240 --> 01:33:00,880
joining the server, uh, she ended up, she learned Invis,
Gambit, Loki, and Adam, and only those four characters.

879
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:06,280
Um, and because of that, you know, she didn't know that I
was gonna be Gambit.

880
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:12,140
She didn't know that I was gonna be Gambit, and Kiki was
gonna be Invis.

881
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:16,620
Like, that was the main, we're gonna be like, these were the
main rules that we're gonna do and yes kiki already knows

882
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:23,840
how to do the other supports as well so um it was very
restricting because like yuzu could only do low-key or adam

883
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:32,180
and she can't play anything else after that so um because
like you know they started batting invis they started

884
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:38,640
batting invis and then started playing characters that
counter loki so we were and then also gambit they started

885
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:46,300
batting gambit invis so we're like what do we we're so
that's why i have to go Like, I was like, okay, I'm going to

886
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:47,080
go on Rocket.

887
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:53,360
And I had to go on Luna because, like, I'm the most flexible
out of all of us.

888
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,020
So I was like, okay, it's okay.

889
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:56,800
I'll be Rocket and I'll be Luna.

890
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:58,920
You can play Adam.

891
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:06,600
We're going to have to figure out how we're going to, I'm
going to try to coach you on the fly on Adam after you

892
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:10,000
played Loki for how long, for so many hours.

893
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:14,300
I'm going to be live coaching you right now in the finals.

894
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:22,980
is live or die if we lose this we're not first place but
that's no pressure though you know how like because at first

895
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:32,760
she started she was resing in the middle of everyone as adam
when i said oh play for res and after the first match i was

896
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:48,800
like hi i had to i was like you suit you gotta hide you see
it and she improved so fucking fast she improved incredibly

897
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:58,800
fast too afterwards um sink or swim you had no pressure by
the way um in the second game she improved a lot um and I

898
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:04,920
also obviously I had to call out soul bond too because like
you know the soul bonds also helped out a lot with like all

899
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:13,760
the other also I was like soul bond soul bond us now so I
obviously I had to do live coaching on the fly to tell her

900
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,480
when to use it.

901
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:23,040
the abilities too because like they actually saved our lives
like the soul bond saved us too for a lot of things um and

902
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:30,300
also isa too isa was very versatile you know she wasn't
supposed to be our tank player she was supposed to be like

903
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:37,080
the tps player and then we put on tank because we're like we
need a tank like so i'm really happy with how versatile

904
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:42,340
everybody was like you know she wasn't even supposed to play
tank she was like the namor player um but we're like we

905
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:48,120
ain't playing We're not playing Namor because other teams
know how to counter Namor, but they don't know how to

906
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:48,420
counter.

907
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:49,900
They don't really know how to counter.

908
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,020
So she tanked really hard.

909
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:53,940
Isa did a really good job tanking as well.

910
01:35:55,140 --> 01:36:01,940
And she was very, like, you know, her IGLing was also
pretty, like, she, not co-IGL, like, because she helped with

911
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:02,340
co-IGL.

912
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:03,800
Like, I don't know, is it called shock calling?

913
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,560
It was more so of target calling.

914
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,940
She helped out with target calling, you know.

915
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:13,580
So it helps out a lot with target calling because, like,
people, things, sometimes things weren't dying.

916
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:19,160
the card could call um but i had to take over at one point
because we're target tiling the wrong thing like they're

917
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:24,300
like get the they're getting like get this guy that's 20
mile like for it i was like no kill the thing on the card

918
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:30,140
guys ignore i know they're like kill these supports so they
can't heal the thing on the card i was like guys it's over

919
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:42,100
time guys it is over time it doesn't matter if like it
doesn't matter we kill the support we have to kill the thing

920
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:53,700
on the card like We can kill the support later After they're
trying to run to the cart Because it's overtime And they

921
01:36:53,700 --> 01:37:09,060
have to touch the cart Yeah I had to like I had to redirect
the Target calling I was like no Cart I was like Cart guys

922
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:22,260
That tilted me so hard um um that took me so hard because
there was like a full it was like a fucking hat full hp emma

923
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:32,120
just chilling in the car and then she like held a oh no it
was a full hp emma on the point while everyone else wanted

924
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:43,900
to chase kills in front of us i was like guys we need to cap
the point please kill emma like like kill the thing on the

925
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:57,400
at first before we do anything else like um um but yeah no
isa did a really job heavenly our fucking secret weapon like

926
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:05,540
um like i said he signed up cps but we put him on tank
because he was our best tank player like he was he was our

927
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:13,420
he was our actual best tank player because we had no other
even though it was his off roll it was the best tank player

928
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:23,020
and you know they didn't expect that secret weapon you know
the um the you know he that he was supposed to be like our

929
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:33,240
other dps player that we like hid that's what i was saying
intel is key i didn't want to leak any of our any of our

930
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:39,940
strats i was like hide your profiles intel is so important
in these this is why pro players all pro players hide their

931
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:46,320
match history because they don't want like and that's why
pro players don't stream their scrims um it's similar in any

932
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:52,340
hero shooter like overwatch they do the same thing um
because you know they there's like a hidden black market for

933
01:38:52,340 --> 01:39:00,560
uh players leaking scrims to other teams and stuff like that
like that's gonna be like bro you got that scrim like you yo

934
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:12,520
bro didn't you scrim this team last night can we like borrow
can we watch that replay like but we're like dark web of

935
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:17,940
like like exchanging they're like we're gonna be screaming
this team later that you're gonna face in the in the

936
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:24,080
tournament so we're like we can and and you know your face
you scream that team and we're gonna be facing them so like

937
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:30,900
can we like you know like i'll give you our scrim vod and
our scrim replay and then you guys give us your their scrim

938
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:40,460
replay so like you know for it yeah it's like the intel war
like like info swapping yeah exactly nothing is more

939
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:47,080
valuable than information and i heard like other teams were
also just studying like um like what so that's why it's like

940
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:54,300
private your profiles private your profiles and don't talk
about what we're playing because obviously um maybe some one

941
01:39:54,300 --> 01:40:01,580
was like we don't want you know there's like chat hoppers
and stuff like that so um i was like worried about people

942
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:09,680
like leaking our comms leaking the our comps that we had so
i was like okay i'm gonna do these bad guys look at i'm

943
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:17,360
gonna type on type and stuff if this happens um because like
that's why they didn't expect us to you know have the comps

944
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:28,460
we had because i was like no leaks no leaks it was best of
one like like what can i do in that situation it's literally

945
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:37,240
whoever has the most information wins a best of one because
that shit is scary like i'm so happy we didn't get

946
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:43,620
domination It's so hard to adjust in domination.

947
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:53,900
Yeah, so, I mean, we did get domination versus Amelie's
team, but like I said, it was so, so close.

948
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:57,600
Because in domination, you have to adjust so fucking fast.

949
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,660
Yeah, but yeah, anyway, that was the tournament.

950
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,260
Yeah, I think that's everything about the tournament.

951
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,120

I don't want to make...

1037
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:14,540
I didn't eat dinner yet.

1038
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,800
I'm going to make Carbonara Bulldog noodles.

1039
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:21,020
And then I'm going to put mozzarella cheese on top.

1040
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:22,280
And then I'm going to get it.

1041
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,260
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

1042
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:23,680
Alright.

1043
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:24,400
Hey guys.

1044
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,120
As always, everybody.

1045
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:27,220
And eggs.

1046
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,500
Oh, and scrambled eggs too.

1047
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:29,120
As always, everybody.

1048
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:30,060
Stay hydrated.

1049
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:30,660
Poster check.

1050
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:31,720
Yeah, but moving around.

1051
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:32,740
Get that.

1052
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:34,160
Blood flowing.

1053
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:34,520
Sorry.

1054
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:37,300
I'm like, what?

1055
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:45,960
What's that liquid inside our bodies to get that blood
placed in for me and Tibet because you deserve it.

1056
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:48,340
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1057
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:49,580
Bye, guys.

1058
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:50,560
Bye.
