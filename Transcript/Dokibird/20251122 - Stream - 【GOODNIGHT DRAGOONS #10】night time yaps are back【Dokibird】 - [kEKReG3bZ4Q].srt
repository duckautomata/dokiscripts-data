Let's see.

18
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,260
There's another VTuber tournament.

19
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,060

00:05:12,060 --> 00:06:23,740
had another rival's tournament is crazy another vtuber rival's tournament it's crazy uh thank you guys i'm sorry i'm like i'm like so out of it like i'm so guys i want oh jen you're right what another i forgot bro things are blurring together guys i i actually i don't i don't know you guys remember but um you know how like after the interview i literally disassociated for like a couple of minutes like I was not okay I like right after I left the call with Connor and IMS I think it was just like I forgot I was like on I forgot I was streaming like I literally forgot that I was still streaming I thought like oh shit now I'm off stream I can I left the call and I was like it's over like i don't have to like i'm off like i'm not like i know i was like wait i'm streaming i i was like wait a minute oh wait i'm streaming too i forgot

22
00:06:27,600 --> 00:07:14,440
yeah oh yes this is so seen because i it's just so much adrenaline and everything i need um i need to like no there it's youtube side that's so that sucks that um um uh that uh what was I gonna say oh yeah it sucks that my last game YouTube got hit got hit hard that was that was unfortunate but what could you do at least the did the VOD survive I was too scared to watch the VOD I watched a bit of the the replay on oh the VOD is fine that's good I watched a bit of the replay of the games themselves on on Seedog and Aramouse's stream.

23
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,960
Let's see how people were thinking.

24
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:25,780
I also watched a little bit of Shoto's POV during that unfortunate game that I had against them.

25
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,880
I need you guys to know, I was not, my hands were shaking the entire time for that very first game.

26
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,400
I was not aiming at all.

27
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,580
Like, I'm surprised I hit any shots.

28
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,520
During that first game.

29
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,220
So, um, I don't know if you guys know that.

30
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,280
I think you guys could tell.

31
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:54,620
And then after that, um, after, uh, after the first game, like, my aim, like, relaxed after that.

32
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
Um, it was fine after that, yeah.

33
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,220
Um, but like after the first game, I was fine with my aim.

34
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,560
Yo, you guys, you guys like how aggressive I was?

35
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,060
Because I, okay, like, I would never do this.

36
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,140
And, and if I was in my top 500.

37
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:39,860
lobby i would never been that aggressive but i knew i knew i could out aim at least 70 of at least 70 to 80 of the people in that tournament so i knew i could like even as rocket as rocket too because like they know but they don't expect the rocket damage is actually insane it rockets damage is insane up close and no one ever expects the rocket to shoot back so when i rock it all i was just like,

38
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,800
that's right, bitch.

39
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,040
I was just like, I was like, get over here.

40
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:55,800
I fucking mowed down an entire tank into like, to zero HP is crazy.

41
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,020
Uh, that's close.

42
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,980
But the thing is, I know I could get, I knew I could get away with it in this tournament.

43
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:39,740
Um, but, um, I, I, I obviously in rank, in rank because um all the fucking rank players like all the top 500 players would fucking shit on me and shut me down but i knew i knew like even as luna the moment i swapped the luna oh my god luna feels so slow after i started playing gambit for those who don't know luna is not meta anymore so that's why we avoided playing luna um and we only had to play luna during like certain scenarios like the storm vault you have to play luna for storm vault um So,

44
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,760
if she felt so slow when I was, like, swapping to Gambit, like, aim-wise as well.

45
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:55,180
Like, it was so weird trying to aim on Luna because I'm not used to aiming on Luna with, like, after playing Gambit for so long.

46
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,240
Like, yeah, she's finally freed.

47
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,360
We're finally free.

48
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,900
Yeah, I was glad that...

49
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,660
Now you guys can see why I was fucking...

50
00:10:09,160 --> 00:11:05,580
guys can tell see that i would like 1v1 other players and i was that confident as as uh like there was i had so much mobility it's actually crazy as gambit you can have so much fucking ability you can see me like go in and then go out and i'm still alive like that's why yeah and um um i use gambit very aggressively the difference between a bad gambit and like a good gambit is um you use your abilities aggressively so you don't use it to heal you literally use it to just anti things and like you just play as anna that's really it um um and he's just like he like people are like oh he's the kierko he's he's the anna he's the anna of marvel rivals so and he has you can see like how if you guys ever when you were watching the games um and every time my back

51
00:11:09,160 --> 00:12:10,440
instantly and like killed the dive that's why i was not afraid of like flankers everyone they're like oh what about the flankers i was like just mark them if you mark them i can kill them because i have so much like my kit is just so fucking strong yeah it's just so strong like um uh gash can you welcome to tamil find welcome welcome um uh fiction name is super chat thank you thank you unfortunately no but there is a way to watch the bots wink wink wink you might have to ask a dragon about it there is a way to still access the streams um but you have to ask a dragon about it because i i don't know um oh man yeah i heard heavenly like locked in with dps by playing like blasting music out and fucking just going ham.

52
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,980
Okay, I gotta make my my victory tweet real quick, guys.

69
00:14:50,260 --> 00:15:12,900
I almost dropped out because wait should I say that I almost dropped out I literally had a breakdown last night because I almost dropped out no I don't need to add that yet I'll tell you guys the story okay Uh, dropping a little fun fact, guys.

70
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,360
Uh, felt, yeah, I was, I'd fucking, I was like, I hope we win one game.

71
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:27,340
I, because, like, I said, we literally, as a full team together, like, with all six of us, we had two hours together of all six of us.

72
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,440
And then, uh, five of us, we had four hours of practice.

73
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:40,080
But I literally saw some teams that were, like, um, in the VC for two days, morning to night, for hours.

74
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,880
And I was like, oh, no, are we not practicing enough?

75
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,020
I was, like, so scared.

76
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,180
And I was like, oh, my gosh, oh.

77
00:15:46,740 --> 00:16:07,800
And then, like, you know, I was like, oh, we don't have, you know, we don't have a, we don't have, like, you know, like an X-Pro DPS player or like, like, in a top 500 DPS player, you know, or like in an X-Pro in different types of games or anything or just like,

78
00:16:07,820 --> 00:17:01,880
you know, gifted, you know, you guys can be like, oh, dokey but you got top 500 in like overwatch and apex and stuff like that but like i play support now in rivals and that is because like you know like i would see like the enemy dps players like you know i would see sk or like blur like like just walking around and i couldn't do anything about it i have to like all i could do like i want to shoot them but i mean i did shot blur a couple of times and also SK a couple of times but it was very there were also very risky moves to take for me as a support because when I die my team doesn't get kills anymore so so um so like it was very risky for me to to try and take those shots to try and do one like like 1v1 against like the really,

79
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,100
really, really good DPS players.

80
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,540
So I was very nervous because we didn't, I guess like we didn't, our team was just very, very well-rounded.

81
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,520
Like we were so lucky to have such an amazing combination.

82
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:31,120
Like even though it was like assigned, pre-assigned, our team was just really good in terms of like, we're all just good, well-rounded individuals.

83
00:17:31,560 --> 00:18:27,500
that we could literally just play anything yeah like we could play even though we're not all of our average was a bit lower uh was a bit lower compared to others um um we managed to like we were so flexible with everything yeah um and you know i know i i had really good igls and stuff like that i yeah oh my god i just watched the vod of them just i sorry i accidentally had a vod of the the Shoto match and then where the fuck did I come from where I just suddenly fucking killed the Magneto I don't know like I just saw Magneto die now like where the like by me I was like where the fuck did I come from like I'm sorry yeah yeah I was like yeah fuck you muted like fear what bitch like fear this

84
00:18:31,500 --> 00:19:25,260
um um any any oh wait whoa the muted situation was crazy yeah yeah yeah heavenly was our secret weapon regarding like the flex uh being the flex like actual dp by the way he was he was he was the role he chose was dps um he was like my first choice is dps but we're but he was the strongest tank player in our entire team so we're like we're putting on tank um um because like obviously our other dps player was melee only so you know when they started playing flyers when they started fucking playing flyers we were like oh shit okay swap what are you gonna do punch them from the sky yeah that ain't season one iron fist bro like yeah

85
00:19:29,400 --> 00:20:28,980
yeah it was our hawk like that's why i said don't say anything i told my team private your profiles don't say anything because they were all they all the other teams were analyzing our mains we're trying to figure out our mains and everything yeah uh oh can i get my second happy birthday from my oh she also congrats on winning a tournament gordon thank you for the super chat thank you thank you you have your birthday is two days don't worry don't worry i'll still be here to wish you a Gordon happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear Gordon happy birthday to you yeah happy birthday yeah yeah he was yeah his Hawkeye got banned instantly but he was a he was literally a hitscan DPS player so like he could just play other hitscans like he was a hitscan projectile DPS player like he was our non melee character so it didn't matter if they Target band,

86
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:53,860
Hawkeye, because he could still play, you know, he could still fucking play, like, the other gun shooty DPS play, DPS, yeah, um, uh, so, yeah, I'm just, I'm really fucking, uh, proud of my team for it, um, I, bro, like, the amount of, like, I literally woke up,

87
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:29,280
five, uh, I woke up at, like, 10, a.m yeah i woke up at 10 a.m and started researching today because i started researching um my teams because like uh started researching all the like all the enemy teams and stuff because okay this is like really fucked up but like um i know like others were doing the same like there was a lot of money on the line too and like you know uh others were also doing something so i assume others were doing something similar because i saw people private their profiles um after joining the But like,

88
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,580
I know it's like pretty messed up, but it's research.

89
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,760
I like, that's, I find this fun.

90
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:46,620
I find the strategizing and trying, like, trying to figure out, like, what to play against.

91
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,940
Because that's, that's literally competitive.

92
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,040
Like, you can say, like, oh, it's for fun.

93
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,340
But like, that's, it's still competitive in a way.

94
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,580
Like, it's still a competitive environment.

95
00:21:58,920 --> 00:23:10,600
yeah i did for the love of the game but and i love i love like the strategies and like strategize because it's rock paper scissors bandline is rock paper scissors um if you get a good bandline you fucking win the game so uh so like what i did basically i don't know i think i said it before but i looked up everybody's profiles like one by one because they uh gave us access to uids um and I looked it up one by one and then all the ones that had their profiles open I looked at history and then I see all the comps they played together in the six stack so that's that's literally what I did and um so and then like also if they are open I see what they mean I just look at what they made and see the thing is this is what my bad line was I look for players I look for players who have been who are newer in the game and if they're playing important This is why our team was the only team that banned Emma because from my research Um,

96
00:23:10,800 --> 00:24:23,960
this is the only reason why our like though other all the other teams they didn't ban Emma What I noticed because, uh, they had their profiles open was that I realized Um, I realized that they only they only had time to learn one new character and emma their only tank player learned all they did was learn emma for like their and their second most played tank was mag with 11 minutes so they i noticed that oh wait they're only their main only tank player and you guys remember in the VOD in the VOD where uh where they were like where I was like guys read what my discord message because we were watching we were watching uh we were watching dubie and amelie's I think it was like yeah dubie versus amelie and then uh amelie versus uh uh fuck oh my gosh my mind is blurring together who is the 13 this who is the 13 guys it was uh Shoto.

97
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,260
It was Amalee versus Shoto.

98
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:32,760
And what I typed in the Discord was like, do you notice how they are playing one tank and their one tank is their Emma player?

99
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,260
Like...

100
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,320
So my brain is like frazzled right now because I've been doing a lot of thinking.

101
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,960
And that was why I was typing in the Discord server.

102
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,480
And I was like, don't be afraid.

103
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,700
They're literally playing one tank and their one tank is their Emma one trick.

104
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,560
And that's why I banned Emma You know how I got this strat?

105
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:01,840
Because fucking XQC during the XQC tournament, Target Band Tyler won.

106
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,840
Despite our team being incredibly stacked.

107
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,220
And all Tyler won did.

108
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,640
Great guy.

109
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,360
Very funny.

110
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:22,080
But all he did on Hulk when we did a D1 XQC, Target Band are poor new player who can only play Venom.

111
00:25:26,340 --> 00:26:07,500
He targeted Ben Tyler 1 We were We won a majority of our games XQC lost all his games We went to knockout stages And XQC's team Knocked us out Because they realized Wait Tyler 1 can only play Venom And then we had to put Tyler 1 On Hulk and he fucking fed his ass off and then we got knocked out we were the favorites to get first or second and then we got knocked out and from that was where I learned my lesson

112
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:26,780
this was where I realized this was the strat because my team was like no we shouldn't Emma, we have to ban Hella and Siloc.

113
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,900
I was like, no, you don't understand.

114
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,860
It was a life lesson.

115
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,320
That what he did to us was a fucking life lesson.

116
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:42,200
And then after we got knocked out by XKC's team, when we were the favorites, like instantly gone.

117
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,380
It was like group stages and we got he lost every game.

118
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,700
We won every game.

119
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
So we're like, this is easy.

120
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,700
You know, like, oh, we're against the team that lost every game.

121
00:26:51,800 --> 00:27:19,760
Like, we're supposed to win this and then he they realized wait we can target bad tyler one because that's their second tank and then everything fell apart because it became a 5v6 because tyler one had to learn an entire new tank during that during that one that like live on that game uh So my team was like,

122
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,180
no, no, bad Hela Silos, because they were very scary.

123
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,660
Because we don't want to deal with Namor Team Up with Hela.

124
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,240
And also, we don't want to deal with SK Silos.

125
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,400
And I was like, no, guys, we have to ban Emma.

126
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,020
You don't understand.

127
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,920
Their main tank player can only play Emma.

128
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,740
At the moment we take that away from him, their entire front line collapses.

129
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,090
I was like, you don't understand.

130
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,590
Like, and then they're like, and I pulled up the excuse me thing.

131
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,390
It happened to me in this tournament.

132
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,910
You don't understand.

133
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,110
I literally got knocked off because of that.

134
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,550
Like,

135
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,800
I was like, we have to do this.

136
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,060
Like, yeah.

137
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,380
Yeah, so.

138
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:53,940
so like because you know having you know they lost their main tank so like the the the strat was just basically by losing their main tank because it's very hard to learn a new character after spending hours on the one tank you know the one character that you were told to learn uh for the last two days and suddenly bam the band went in like so so it essentially becomes a 5v6.

139
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,540
Okay, also, the other thing was that I was going to try and ban Hella too after that.

140
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:07,240
I was going to be like Emma Hella because I was like, let's give Eski SILOC because I feel bad because like she was Target bad the entire time.

141
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,640
And then obviously my team was like, don't do that, bro.

142
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,940
You're like, because like, you know, Yannirs has only played Hella the entire time.

143
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,940
And I was like, bro, let's just let Eski play SILOC, man.

144
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,880
She got Target bad.

145
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:51,760
And then my team was like, no, that's bullying you're gonna you're bullying the two new players for my batting their new their characters and i was like but i just want to give eskade siloed and that's why i was like let's gotcha it guys let's but then but then we got domination i was like no gotcha i ain't fighting siloed on domination i okay it was because we were guaranteed in the final so at that point i didn't care whether we I was like,

146
00:29:51,860 --> 00:30:07,940
no, I don't want to die to Scylok on domination because domination is the best map for Scylok So I was like, no, I was gonna be nice, but never mind I was just like, I just hated playing domination with Scylok, like against Scylok I was just like, I'm sorry,

147
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,540
the map picked the map didn't want me like

148
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,300
Yeah, that one map changed my entire my entire career

149
00:30:26,920 --> 00:31:29,760
yeah um jacquardo thank you super chat thank you thank you some may underestimate dokey coming out with big brain stress because they don't expect research mode dokey but when it's rival she uses 110 of the brain thank you super chat i think i could be i i don't think i actually no i don't think i'm a good analyst honestly i had a lot of help from um figuring out how to analyze situations um from other pro players just watching pros and like just talking to other pro players and also like talking to like the managers of uh pro teams so it helped a lot trying to figure because like you know i was very undecided about some things so like so like they helped me a lot when they um when they were like teaching me how to analyze the situation because i also didn't play this season a lot that's also because like like i literally started this season three days ago I I literally started this season three days ago so I was like not not like not like very informed like I wasn't very informative

150
00:31:29,760 --> 00:32:35,080
of like what to fucking swap you know like I was like do I do this or do I do that like because I was very like I'm very proud of my team for being able to like think for themselves about counterswapping too so I'm glad that they also thought for themselves as well um and being able to like because when i don't know what to counter swap i was just like just they they were like i'll do this then but i did like i did like been more pro i was very proactive in the end about counter swapping because like i didn't want people them to hesitate because i was like we got i like i was just like guys come on guys we got we got we have to like think really fast because i like the thing about me because i have the game a top 500 hiring player so um um you know we our duty as like especially a support player we have to react fast basically we have to react and think very fast about the situation because like one second can cost like the entire game so i have to like be like i actually have to take

151
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:43,520
control about the swapping be like swap now swap that swap now swap this like i was like he's I was like, he's Moon Knight.

152
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,980
Go, go back to spawn room and go get off of Loki.

153
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,300
And then the user was like, wait, right now?

154
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,580
Like, the game's like, yes, right now.

155
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,600
Yes, right now.

156
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,840
Get off of Loki.

157
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,060
Like, I don't care if you have...

158
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,360
Yeah, I realized, like, after the first map, I had to be more...

159
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,060
I have to be more proactive with calling for swaps and stuff.

160
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:27,860
It's because, like, I am also used to it for, you know, I started playing competitive in Overwatch, and Overwatch was all about counterswapping, and so you had to think fast.

161
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,400
And then Apex, it's all about rotations and everything.

162
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,000
And so that taught me about, like, rotations and, like, positioning and stuff.

163
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:43,600
And so, like, combining those two into rivals, Helped out a lot.

164
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,040
I was really impressed with how you're able to micromanage just enough to wrangle your team.

165
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,560
Yeah, it's very hard on Gambit because Gambit has a lot of things to do.

166
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:10,720
So like my brain was actually on fucking overtime trying to figure out like what to Like what to say what to do on Gambit only because like I have like 50 other buttons to play use like and like be aware of my surroundings too.

167
00:34:11,220 --> 00:35:33,360
Okay, but yeah out um i'm glad i was able to play gambit because i don't know if you guys noticed but gambit is a very very broken like i literally got to okay you guys do notice because i always i'm so humbled but i sort of talk about it a bit you know you know i sort of talk about it here and there but you know how i got top 500 in two days by playing gambit yeah but he is so good on um he is he is the best support character like in this game and i'm there's no way they're keeping him like that and there's no way they're keeping him like that though because rank one two three four and five currently is literally one guy one pro player who just plays gambit and he got rank one two three and four and five right now and his play style is basically i basically took my play style is basically his play style i took how i've analyzed how he plays and i just played like him yeah that's that's how fucking broken gambit is at the moment yeah His name is Saipay,

168
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,340
but yeah, he's like rank 1 to 5 at the moment on Gambit.

169
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,600
So, that's why you see how aggressive, like, I do heal.

170
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,020
Like, I'd never use my heals.

171
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,000
You can tell that I'd never use my healing cards.

172
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,500
And all I did was just anti-people over and over again.

173
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,500
Because, like, his primary heal is just so strong already.

174
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,100
So, like, it doesn't, like, he doesn't need to use his cards to heal.

175
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,680
because it takes fucking forever to charge.

176
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,860
It's a good...

177
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,100
I'm actually having a lot of fun playing Gambit, too.

178
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,140
Yeah, his anti-heal is just way too strong to use it for anything else.

179
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,800
Like I said, it's just Anna.

180
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,240
It's just really Anna.

181
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,000
Oh, sorry.

182
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,020
But, yeah, okay, I forgot.

183
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,180

Sorry, he didn't stay up.

221
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,450
He left after an hour or two.

222
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,970
I don't know how long he stayed because I was doing my endurance battlefield stream.

223
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,570
I didn't know.

224
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,900
It still counts.

225
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,660
Oh.

226
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:45,320
Thank you, everyone, for supporting me and my team.

All right.

229
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,760
I'm so happy to have made it this far.

230
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,700
There you go.

231
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,420
No dinner because Jolly Bee was gone.

232
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,540
closed, sad face.

233
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,800
I love the air that you would see.

234
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,880
Oh my gosh, I'm so tired.

235
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,600
My eyes actually, like, feel so heavy.

236
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,940
I think it's like, I'm not tired.

237
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,480
I think I'm, like, I'm not, like, physically tired.

238
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,480
I'm, like, mentally tired.

239
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,600
I think that that's it.

240
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,320
I don't physically feel tired.

241
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,660
I'm just mentally so exhausted.

242
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,420
From, because I had to use...

243
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:47,160
so much of my brain power to play that entire tournament because I was, you know, I was watching some of the other streams.

244
00:41:47,420 --> 00:42:03,760
I think my biggest advantage was that I have so much experience in tournaments that like I know how to lead a team in terms of like IGLing because I have so much experience

245
00:42:07,120 --> 00:43:06,960
rank lobbies that like um um it gave our team an advantage because then we knew what to do like we had a plan each time we don't hesitate to so like that was like our one of our big because i was watching like the other like i was watching like i think like two of the povs i didn't i didn't watch dubie's pov for like her matches but um like the there was no like i guess there was were all trying to like decide as a team on what to do and what not to do but for me i was like no we're doing this you know they're like do it yeah i was like no we're doing this i was like you you do this we're gonna do this next and then we're gonna do this next i was like don't all everyone do not all but like yeah yeah i'll be like uh uh i was like Yuzu,

246
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:07,920
don't come out.

247
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,840
Keep hiding.

248
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,500
Yeah, because I know Yuzu wants to join the fight.

249
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,500
And I was like, Yuzu, don't come out of the hole.

250
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,680
Keep fucking hiding.

251
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,820
and I'm like, don't awe, and then Heavenly throws his awe.

252
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,640
And I'm like, bro!

253
00:43:32,460 --> 00:44:03,820
And so, Luna, the thing is, um i know kikio was very shy um she was a she's a very shy player apparently um gomez told me that when i wasn't in the college she talked a lot so i think she was very intimidated by me um like because like he was doing individual coaching um for anyone that wants it and he was doing individual coaching for anyone that wanted like you know extra help like while i was playing

254
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:37,000
struggling playing battlefield and he told me that um there was like four of them in the car and she was like yapping a lot and like she's like you were just very he was like yeah you're like you're very intimidating yeah when i get like super serious you know i get super serious uh um during like uh when you know because i i love competitive games in general so I didn't,

255
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:48,860
she didn't say she didn't have all, you know, she could, you know, she was, I was like, Luna, oh, Luna, oh, because I didn't see her all, I didn't realize she all did, because I think I was dead, um, so I saved my all, because I was waiting for her to all,

256
00:44:49,340 --> 00:45:09,300
um, and then I tapped, I was like, oh, you didn't have all, I was just like, uh, I was like, oh, wait, I pressed tab, I was like, wait, no, never mind, you didn't have all, I was like, what the fuck, why aren't you all, but she didn't say anything, She didn't say anything until I pressed staff.

257
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:09,860
Yeah.

258
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,660
Yeah, she was so scared to tell me she didn't have, oh, yeah.

259
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,080
I'm just glad that we still won the fight, though.

260
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,500
Yeah, the others had to say it, yeah.

My God, I forgot to make a waiting room, too, for this stream.

272
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,400
It went so smooth in the day and was so professional in that.

273
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,500
And I didn't expect to marry all the fans and even winning it all.

274

Here's our...

356
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,470
This is why I posted it, so I just look at it whenever.

357
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:32,890
And these are, like...

358
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,050
They have an anti-ban...

359
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,730
I was like, what maps are Angela?

360
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:36,430
You know?

361
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,070
And then...

362
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,450
And then there's, like, Dubee's team.

363
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,070
The Dubee files.

364
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,410
Yeah, and then, here you go.

365
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,590
Here's our bantering scrims, because they did a scrim.

366
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,650
They did a scrim against, like...

367
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:59,290
But I should have told them like they're fucking around like and these are not the actual comps you're playing because I know their quick play comps were the real comps They did a scrim like doobie and shoto screamed each other and And but they were fucking around with their comps for it and also their band line So I knew that this wasn't a real comps and I looked at the quick play and that's where I found the real comps Because I was like yeah like if they're six stacking quick play playing their actual real comps because it was consistent and then so i was like hella's main band and penny obviously we swapped that around later uh i swapped that around later after that because i was just like oh uh we later were like we bad bucky hella uh because we realized um at first we're like oh all of them could play penny and then we're like oh wait no bucky hella is a better strat just because like we saw we saw you know the first what dubie and amalie were the was the first team to play

368
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:29,370
against each other so um we noticed that blur was really good at bucky so we swapped our band line or i swapped the band line and was like okay we ban um hella and bucky um and uh at first we wanted to ban group because we realized they only play group uh we they really only played group so then i was just like but so That was like we're doing the same thing as like ban Emma because that's the only thing they play But then we're like oh,

369
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,230
it's fine.

370
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:53,390
Like their DPS is a lot scarier than like because their tanks can swap to something else Even though they have to swap to uh, they have to swap to a DPS but um We just realized just bucky we don't want to deal with bucky up because we have a low key And also like you know they had to play moon knight to counter our low key and we so we're like you know,

371
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:54,830
he's just going to farm our clones.

372
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:59,370
And we're like, Hella, we don't want to deal with the team up because we notice how good they are at the team up.

373
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,210
So we don't have a Hella and a Namor player.

374
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,070
And this was our second one here.

375
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:09,410
Oh, that's...

376
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:10,850
So yeah, ban Emma.

377
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,230
Yeah, that's...

378
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:19,250
They have a player that only knows how to play Emma.

379
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,400
So...

380
00:57:24,580 --> 00:58:15,900
there it is and then my team argued against it and was like um my team was like no don't ban emma we have to ban hella we have to ban hella because it's scary the name where team up is scary i was like no i played these games before i i was like i play these i got knocked out because my trick could only play venom and we were the favorites and we got knocked out by the by the last place team because they banned my one chick i was not having history repeat itself

381
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,160
yeah that's like my strategy i was like get rid of the front line

382
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:52,340
so so my strat was to get rid of the front line because like i said when the front line falls everything falls thank you pat thank you xqc for giving me enough trauma to do this to someone else like i continue the cycle i

383
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,360
continue this cycle.

384
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,500

01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,140
If you really want to.

407
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:43,680
Okay.

408
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,140
All right.

409
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,800
Let's see.

410
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,850
Can't believe they target bad me.

411
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,130
I'm just a support player.

412
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:13,190
I'm just a support player, guys.

413
01:02:13,470 --> 01:03:20,130
how come i got targeted um but oh but oh bum bum all right okay so i'll tell you guys more about the details okay so i almost dropped out um of the obvious the whole i mean that's basically the whole story i almost dropped out of the tournament because i was so stressed out and like i've been very stressed out the last month and um there was like a lot of like balancing stuff going on last minute a lot of people being um replaced and everything and then i felt so bad because um i didn't also i didn't really want to be captain i didn't want to be captain at all um because like you know i feel like if we could make our own name instead of being like team dokeybird you know like that would be less stressful but it was like team dokeybird i represent the entire team and then you know i and the fact that i had to do like the interviews and everything and like and like i knew it because i was captain i have to do the interviews and stuff so it was like so much and there was so much so many

414
01:03:20,130 --> 01:04:38,510
eyes on me like literally when they announced it everyone was like yo keeper it's gonna sweep the entire tournament and everything and there was so much pressure on me because everyone knows that i'm like the marvel rivals vtuber and so like but then i got really nervous because when we were seeing when we got our team thing when we got the team list uh um I was very worried because like I said it was 70% support players so a lot of people had to off-roll and we didn't really have like you know like pure tank players so people that's why that's also why I was so aggressive I um I got like that's why I was so aggressive because I knew a lot of people are off-rolling so like even the tanks so I knew like an actual tank player would fucking shut me down instantly um so but I knew I was like you're off-rolling you know I was like you you're off-rolling I'm coming for you like that's I was just like I was like fucking fighting everyone because i knew they were off rolling um so i was not

415
01:04:38,510 --> 01:05:19,340
scared because they don't they don't know their uh their full potential as that character because if you saw me go up against the strange you know what i'm told at i'm like told that like never as a support player never try not even as a support or dps player you're never supposed to do a 1v1 against will always win the fight but i was like you were off rolling i know you don't know how to kill me like so i'm also like punishing too because i was like i know you don't know how to kill me bro

416
01:05:23,820 --> 01:06:44,560
so so that's why i was so fucking aggressive because i knew a lot of the people were off rolling so and same with my team like i said we didn't really have a tank player um but balina was a was a melee dps player he all he mostly plays like um he mostly plays all like iron fist and mr fantastic which is a crazy hero pool like so we had to stick heavenly onto tank and um isa was was our dps player as well but um we realized that a lot of lower elo low ranked players or like you know the rank disparity of players they don't know how to play against iron fist and mr fantastic so especially when iron fist that has a team supporting him um that's why and because teams already struggle with dare devil like if he knew dare to little it would have been perfect but if he knew dare devil it would have been so not fair right um because dare double is like the fucking um the fucking most broken dps character right now in in rivals um uh but like even then like there's also like it um if they knew

417
01:06:44,560 --> 01:07:07,400
like they just need a bucky to counter that's why we were banning bucky too because bucky counters iron fist as well um um so so i was you know i was really nervous about it because, um, um, a lot of the other teams, they had really, really good DPS players,

418
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:22,540
um, that were, like, you know, um, that were, like, even if they were not, even if their ranking rivals isn't high, they've, like, peaked higher in different games, and, um, or they have, like, a higher rank average.

419
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:25,200
Our rank average was not that high.

420
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,240
Uh, like, you know, users literally learned the game two days.

421
01:07:29,400 --> 01:08:29,420
not learn the learn the game but literally um try to pick up the game two days ago um i mean she i think she played quick play before when the game first came out but you know she didn't play a lot she was unranked like she ranked like she got into rank like two days ago and everything um so she had like i had to coach her and kikyu on how to play support because during the first scrims i had like guide them on support all like how to support all and everything because during the scrim yuzu um i don't know if this was during the tournament was this i don't remember if it was a tournament or the scrim but she didn't know when she didn't know which characters was uh which character which copy on loki for loki was uh um for sorry i'm remembering strasel was for aggressive was for defense so I had to teach her that because she was using Luna aggressively.

422
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,500
I was just like, no that's our only defense on, Yuzu.

423
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:34,340
Stop!

424
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,220
So I was like, don't do that again, Yuzu.

425
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,560
She was just like, I was like, okay, I'm gonna cop.

426
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,060
I was like, okay, we're gonna copy.

427
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,420
We're gonna use it defensively and then she copied Luna and like ran into the enemy team.

428
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,900
And I was like, our only defense on.

429
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:20,060
And then she's like sorry because like you know before then she was copying she was copying me non-stop and i always play the aggressive of it but i was like don't copy because and i had to swap to i had to swap to uh rocket i think um because of the comp and and so she i was like copy luna you have to copy luna don't copy me and so she thought that because i was like don't copy rocket you I was just like,

430
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,400
Luna was just better than Rocket.

431
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:31,980
So I was a teacher and be like, okay, just copy our Luna and use it defensively.

432
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,120
But then she was like, oh, I don't know which character is like afterwards.

433
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,100
You know, after she's like, sorry, I didn't know which one's defensive.

434
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,740
I was like, aggressively, Mantis and Gabbit.

435
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:40,420
That's it.

436
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,220
Like, everything else, defensively.

437
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,760
So from there, I was like, and then also Kikyo.

438
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,620
Like I said, I was coaching our support player.

439
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,100
because obviously, you know, I have more of the game sense and knowledge.

440
01:09:53,480 --> 01:10:05,700
I had to teach Kikyo to be like, I'm lucky that no one know how to play Phoenix in the tournament, but I wasn't sure sure because, well, I know, like, Blur can play Phoenix because he's, like, versatile and also SK.

441
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:14,700
I know Blur and SK need to play Phoenix, but I was like, okay, at first, Kikyo would throw Rocket Alts into Phoenix Alts.

442
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,480
Like, when we, you know, because it's, like, stuff like this.

443
01:10:17,540 --> 01:11:19,960
Like, if you know the enemy team has a Phoenix, um you you don't oh it's like playing chicken like that's how you have to play against phoenix when you're rocket so i was just like so at first she like altered she altered before knowing we knew phoenix has alt but she still altered so i was just like during the scrims so i was just like quickly was like yeah don't do that next time you play chicken you hold your rocket up and and because i don't trust my team to shoot the phoenix because we were literally together in two days i don't think we were that coordinated to shoot the fucking phoenix all um so i was just like i was like okay we just wait until the phoenix all then you all next time like stuff like that i was giving like like for me this is very common knowledge for me because you know if i don't do it i get fucking yelled at and i'll start crying um i get yelled at by my team and then i'm gonna start crying so i had to go through that you know so but so that's why common

444
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:46,660
knowledge for me but like you know a lot of these players are not in my rank um my rank to like have that being yelled at them so so I had to like teach them and be like yeah just make sure to do this and yeah we learn when we cry so um I had to like guide them along on um but our team

445
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:59,840
Um, because, like, you know, like I said, even though I'm considered one above all, I'm still a support player, so as a support player, I know, like, you're like, oh, but you guys, you kept everyone up and everything.

446
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:04,380
But also, like, I think what helped me was I could be any role.

447
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:19,620
If I was DPS or tank, if I was DPS or tank, and I was one above all DPS or tank, and I was also IGLing, I could get like 40 kills or like, you know, like 30.

448
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:27,800
plus final hits as a tank or DPS and also IGL, which will leave a much bigger impact for my team.

449
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:46,320
But as support, all I could really do is just give them knowledge, give them comms, and just keep them alive enough to enable them to do as much as they can through the knowledge and the damn brag.

450
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,540
No, it's true.

451
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,180
It's true.

452
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,100
You want to know why?

453
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:57,060
Because Super Gomez had the ring for Heavenly because he couldn't show up yesterday for scrims.

454
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:02,580
And, like, when we won our first game, he was, like, IGLing for us.

455
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,820
And he had 30 final hits.

456
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,540
And he had 30 plus final hits.

457
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,700
And IGLing for us.

458
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,640
And, like, we won against a...

459
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,440
We were scrimming against a...

460
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,740
Yeah, and then I was like, please play more like Heavenly.

461
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:28,640
Like, because I was like, he's not going to get 30 plus final hits on Tink, bro.

462
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:31,720
You got to play more like a diamond player.

463
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:41,260
Like, yeah, I was like, bro, you got to play more like a diamond player, bro.

464
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,800
He's not going to be doing the shit you're doing, man.

465
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,960
I mean, it's so important.

466
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:51,520
Yeah, they are.

467
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,460
They're very important.

468
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:57,720
But I would have a much bigger impact as a DPS and tank.

469
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,460
Because, like, I was a one above all DPS player.

470
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:07,880
Also, I wouldn't do, I would try not to do, like, I would be like, pop, pop.

471
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,400
Maybe sitting, so do it fade off and teach your teammates.

472
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,720
Zyka, thank you for the super chat.

473
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,100
Thank you.

474
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,400
This ain't a realistic scenario.

475
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,020
Yeah.

476
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:50,160
um um yeah so uh so i was really worried because like i got really worried because like i said i saw the team averages and everything and we had like you know we had diamond players we had diamond play we have i think like uh two diamond players we had two diamond players two celestial play So we had two,

477
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,000
we had me, and then we had an underrank.

478
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:58,980
And there was some teams that had, like, two Eternities, two Celestias, and a Platte.

479
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:05,260
And there was, like, one that was, like, GM, but I know you're very good at DPS.

480
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,680
Like, I don't remember the average for that, but...

481
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,880
And then there was also an Eternity player, GM player, Celestia player.

482
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,480
Like, it was...

483
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:18,040
I got really worried, because, like, the second highest...

484
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,620
I got really worried.

485
01:15:19,640 --> 01:16:30,300
for like our team and then everyone's practicing like mornington like everyone was practicing so much i saw everyone just hanging on the vc and i'm like oh shit is it bad that we're not hanging out in the vc also i joined the server late too so that was my fault as well there were a lot of things that were my fault um so because like um i we could have had three days of practice but our team had two days because i joined the server late like so as captain i didn't organize stuff in time for my team because um i joined the server technically like almost a day late so other teams had three days of practice and my team had two days of practice because of that um because they were asking okay it was my fault and i felt so bad i like apologized and everything i'm like I'm sorry for causing such an issue and such a commotion about it But it was whether or not I wanted to be captain or not Because I didn't want to be captain I didn't want the responsibility So I joined the server late Because

486
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:39,080
me and the organizers were trying to figure out If I wanted to be captain or not So

487
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,120
It's so So that's why I joined this.

488
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,360
I felt so bad.

489
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,180
Because I was like, I didn't want the responsibility.

490
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,800
I was so scared and nervous.

491
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,260
It's like so much pressure.

492
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,420
And it wasn't the highest rank, though.

493
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,740
There's players that were higher rank that were captain.

494
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,240
What are you talking about in some of the teams?

495
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,960
Like, I think like the other three teams, it wasn't based on rank.

496
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:45,440
talking about the other three teams weren't even based on rake but mine was so i was i was like that's why i didn't that's why i had that whole discussion with guys like i don't want to be captain because like like if i lose they'll be like team donkey bird and then i have to go to a loser's interview and i was just like bro i don't know about the mental state right now they go guys no you don't understand i know you guys are like oh well but others had to lose they were doing those interviews,

497
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:49,440
but guys, I don't, I was already like, not okay.

498
01:17:49,940 --> 01:18:02,760
Like, I was, I was just not okay, you know, like, no, I was just like, I was, I had a lot of stuff going on, and I was, like, super stressed out.

499
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:39,460
That was, like, super stressed out, and, like, um, um, a lot of stuff going on, and I was just like, pro, I'm, I'm, I don't know, I don't want this to be another one like minus one in stress or plus one plus one in stress so that's why i was like i don't know i won't be captain man like it's like also my luck has been really really bad lately so i don't know like like i've had some really bad luck things happening to me so i was like oh my god this might be another plus one

500
01:18:44,660 --> 01:19:46,620
in gotcha too yeah yeah gotcha was not okay it was not on my side like after that dispatch no no I think dispatch was my breaking point I this match was my breaking because that was it was at the no it was sorry battlefield yeah and then the fact that it took a six out that was the day the six plus hours of battlefield was the day I crashed out and had a breakdown about whether or not I should drop out like that was that day because i was like i played battlefield it took us six plus hours to win and then the day before that i fucked up 385 like roles in dispatch and so yeah so i was just like i don't know so i was like this close and a huge shout out to the organizers because like they had to put up with me crashing out last night,

501
01:19:49,840 --> 01:20:01,640
whether or not like, like, uh, whether or not I was like, I was like, I was gonna be okay, like, but also, it's such a sea dog deal, because they're like, you want to talk to sea dog?

502
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,920
I was like, I'm too embarrassed, man.

503
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,640
I feel so bad being, like, such a nuisance right now.

504
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,180
Um, I, I was like, I felt so bad.

505
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:11,760
I was just like, I'm sorry.

506
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:43,900
I don't like reached out to me himself you know I was like I don't want to talk to see dog because I'm very embarrassed and he still DMed me about it and being like are you okay because I was like bro my mental is like not good at the moment today and even he like reached like him and the organizer reached out and was like no we get it we understand we just want to make sure your mental is okay and I'm like I'll try so so I'm at like I was like what if we don't win anything Like,

what if we don't even win one game?

508
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,420
Like, I was barely that fucking deep.

01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:54,200
Like, I was just like, I was like, what do we, what if we don't even win one game?

Like, what would I do?

01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:59,440
I can't show my face to rivals.

512
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:00,880
I can't.

513
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,020
I can.

514

520
01:22:29,000 --> 01:23:44,940
It's, oh, it is overall a team game, and I think each of them individually played a part in the victory, like, each had their own fucking moments that clutched it up for everyone, um, you know, they all had their insane plays and they all had their own plays that won us certain maps or certain points and everything um so yeah no they they like i i'm sorry for doubting my team i i'm sorry for doubting myself i was doubting myself because i was like i was i was like what if i felt so bad because they're like oh i brought up my team average you know um i was like oh no i brought up my team average I was gonna feel so fucking bad if we lose because of me because you know I was like oh you guys could have got like a better player than me like or like an actual high ranker DPS player or high rank tank player so um so I'm just really proud of them um I know some oh my gosh I saw like um I'm glad they did balance stuff again even though it was last minute because like um alma lee's team was

521
01:23:44,940 --> 01:24:08,500
originally gonna have like uh another eternity support player versus like because like versus like uh because like sk was supposed to be on a different that's why there were so many like swaps and changes because sk was supposed to be on another team and alma lee was was gonna be like have like another eternity support player but they swapped it up uh and gave at the Like,

522
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:13,740
I think it was, like, three days before the tournament and put SK on Amelie's team.

523
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:19,200
And I think that definitely helped balance it a lot more, too.

524
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,460
So, I mean, they did a lot of swaps and stuff.

525
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:36,260
But, yeah, SK was originally not even going to be on Amelie's team because of, because, like, I think I, I think, like, some people brought it up, too, where, like, I'm in these team needs an TPS player.

526
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,100
Oh, yeah, I remember.

527
01:24:38,260 --> 01:25:17,860
I remember I told you guys I was like bro some teams have five support players and one tank I remember when I said that chat I was like bro what the fuck there's one that's what that was Amelie's team I was like bro bro this team has five support players and one tank bro I was just like and then they yeah and then and then later on they like swapped SK onto that team to give them a dps player because because i think like some people were like yeah that's like rough yeah i remember now i was like bro that's fucking rough buddy

528
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:39,000
yeah uh yeah so i was just like oh my god uh The healer, he'll stop for the win.

529
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,920
So I'm glad they did that.

530
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,740
I thought Amelie's team was so strong.

531
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,480
I honestly, I think they had a lot of really, really close games.

532
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,240
I think the issue was just counterswapping.

533
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:57,820
Like I said, Amelie's team was very, very strong in general.

534
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:58,820
Like on paper.

535
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,680
They were very strong on paper and a lot of us were very scared.

536
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:32,220
very scared um because of it i think it's just more so of uh of just like it's just counter counter swapping rock paper scissors it's literally that um they just it just had to be like they just and also the fact that we all target bond to silo because we are not dealing with that every team was balanced in the end yeah

537
01:26:36,280 --> 01:27:02,640
about balancing and stuff um so i'm glad like every uh team was balanced that was my biggest worry that's why i almost dropped out too because i was like oh my gosh like i don't know if this is balanced so like i was just like i don't know i don't know if it's gonna be balanced because everyone's playing off-rolls and stuff and i don't know what their skill level is and

538
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:30,240
um um but i know that's that's basically it i'm i'm i'm happy with how uh everything came out in the end you know i was expecting the worst possible outcome but then you know it's always nice to be pleasantly surprised that's why i was expect i don't know i know like i have like you know It's like,

539
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,420
like, what is it called?

540
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,000
What is it called?

541
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,020
Debbie Downer, you know, the typical Debbie Downer shit.

542
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:40,960
But like, I don't want to go in with high expectations because I don't want to be disappointed.

543
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,020
I don't want to be disappointed.

544
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,120
So I'm glad things were down.

545
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,800
Pleasantly, you mean like fucking first place?

546
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:56,240
Yeah, yeah, you'd be pleasantly surprised.

547
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,440
First place, guys.

548
01:27:58,460 --> 01:27:59,480

Mint.

563
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,480
Oh my god, you know my brain was so frazzled.

564
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,120
I almost called the other name.

565
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:19,880
That's how tired because I've never done that before.

566
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:20,820
That's how tired.

567
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:26,620
Like it was literally like I had I like buffered it.

568
01:29:30,740 --> 01:30:01,680
I had it like my brain buffered it and stopped it instantly but the it showed up in my head yeah it actually like came up in my head when I was like mid and then like in my head it was the other name I I've never the thing is I've never done that before too that's how fucking tired I am like my mental my mental blocks are like not working properly uh Yeah,

569
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,700
no, like, I'm super scared.

570
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:07,000
My mental blocks are actually, like, like, they're being broke.

571
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,900
Like, it's, like, we're down right now.

572
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:11,300
Like, no one has been upkeeping it.

573
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:20,040
Um, um, um, I didn't say it, though.

574
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,220
I, I, the name appeared in my head.

575
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,220
That's why I was like, mint.

576
01:30:30,680 --> 01:31:04,020
so um anyway anyway um what was i gonna say uh we're gonna mince gonna be like in a call with us while we're playing with rage baiter i don't know what we're doing i forgot that she her schedule we were planning on this week and she's like this is my schedule and then and then i was like yeah because like she was double streaming and everything and I was like bro and like she had meetings at night and she's like oh I could do it after my meetings which was like 10 p.m.

577
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:07,700
like it was like what was it like it was like 9 p.m.

578
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:15,080
or some shit she's like oh I could do it after I was like bro I'm not scheduling this after your meeting for your third stream like

579
01:31:18,380 --> 01:32:34,900
yeah I was like you're fucking crazy bro we'll do it next week man we'll do it next week so um um so yeah so we're i don't know what day i need like ping you and be like what day are we doing it again wait what day because like i'm going by her schedule because her schedule is more fucked up than mine right now um uh you'll finally get the i don't think i will i think i'll just be still very confused uh uh uh i think it was super chat thank you but and also we have a sponsor next week and after that i don't know what was the stuff with my schedule i'll figure it out later um um what else oh there was something else i want to talk about i'm trying to run oh also i want to say i'm really proud of my team for being incredibly flexible and we didn't really have one tricks it was i will say um it was very hard to fucking figure out what the fuck to do with our limited when Loki didn't work because Yuzu's hero pool was basically like what Yuzu's hero pool was she can only play four supports

580
01:32:34,900 --> 01:33:19,000
because she had two days to learn four supports which is already really good she like okay three days maybe I don't know I know I knew like she had two to three days to learn as many supports as possible and she learned but at that time because that was a day late uh because i was a day late to joining the server uh she ended up she learned invis gambit loki and adam and only those four characters um and because of that you know she didn't know that i was gonna be gambit she didn't know that i was gonna be gambit and kiki was gonna be invis like that was the main we're gonna be like these were the main rules that we're gonna do and yes kiki already knows how to do the other supports as well so Um,

581
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:27,340
it was very restricting because like Yuzu could only do low key or Adam and she can't play anything else after that.

582
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:31,100
So, um, because like, you know, they started batting Invis.

583
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:35,760
They started batting Invis and then started playing characters that counter Loki.

584
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:38,160
So we were, and then also Gambit.

585
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,120
They started batting Gambit Invis.

586
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:43,900
So we're like, what do we, we're, so that's why I had to go on rocket.

587
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,080
Cause I was like, I was like, okay, I'm gonna go on rocket.

588
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:53,360
And I had to go on Luna because, like, I'm the most flexible out of all of us.

589
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,020
So I was like, okay, it's okay.

590
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:56,060
I'll be rocking it.

591
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:56,800
I'll be Luna.

592
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:58,900
You can play Adam.

593
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:10,000
We're going to have to figure out how we're going to, I'm going to try to coach you on the fly on Adam after you played Loki for how long for so many hours.

594
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:14,360
I'm going to be live coaching you right now in the finals.

595
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,400
It's live or die.

596
01:34:18,340 --> 01:35:36,120
first place but that's no pressure though you know how like because at first she started she was resing in the middle of everyone as adam when i said oh play for res and after the first match i was like hi i had to i was like you suit you gotta hide you suit and then she improved so fucking fast incredibly fast too afterwards um sink or swim you had no pressure by the way um in the second game she improved a lot um and then i also obviously i had to call out soul bond too because like you know the soul bonds also helped out a lot with like all the other ults i was like so bond so bond us now like so i obviously i had to do live coaching on the fly to tell her when to use the abilities too because like they actually saved our lives like the soul bond saved us too for a lot of things um and also isa too isa was very versatile you know she wasn't supposed to be our tank player she was supposed to be like the tps player and then we put on tank because we're like we need a tank like so i'm

597
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:48,420
really happy with how versatile everybody was like you know she wasn't even supposed to play tank she was like the namor player um but we're like we ain't playing namor here because other teams know how to counter Naimore, but they don't know how to counter.

598
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:49,880
They don't really know how to counter.

599
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,020
So she tanked really hard.

600
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:53,900
Isa did a really good job tanking as well.

601
01:35:55,140 --> 01:36:02,380
And she was very, like, you know, she, her IGLing was also pretty, like, she, not co-IGL, like, because she helped with co-IGLing.

602
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:03,820
Like, I don't know, is it called shock calling?

603
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,560
It was more so of target calling.

604
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,940
She helped out with target calling, you know?

605
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:15,200
So it helps out a lot with target calling because, like, people, things, sometimes things weren't dying and you needed someone to target call.

606
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,560
But I had to take over at one point because we're target-tiling the wrong thing.

607
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,680
Like, they're like, get this guy that was 20 miles, like, for it.

608
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,720
I was like, no, kill the thing on the cart, guys.

609
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,160
Ignore, I know they're like, kill the support so they can't heal the thing on the cart.

610
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,700
And I was like, guys, it's over time.

611
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,600
Like, guys, it is over time.

612
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:40,660
It doesn't matter if, like, it doesn't matter if we kill the support.

613
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,120
We have to kill the thing on the cart.

614
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:55,380
We can kill the support later after they're trying to run to the cart because it's over time and they have to touch the cart.

615
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:56,160
Yeah.

616
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:01,960
I had to like, I had to redirect the target calling.

617
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:03,020
I was like, no!

618
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,980
I was like, cart, guys!

619
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:13,980
That tilted me so hard.

620
01:37:15,500 --> 01:38:15,640
um that took me so hard because there was like a full there was like a fucking hat full hp emma just chilling in the car and then she like held a oh no it was a full hp emma on the point while everyone else wanted to chase kills in front of us i was like guys we need to cap the point please kill emma like like kill the thing on the point first before we do anything else like like um um but yeah no isa did a really job heavenly our fucking secret weapon like um like i said he signed up cps but we put him on take because he was our best take player like he was he was our he was our actual best take player because we had no other even though it was his off roll it was the best tank player um and And,

621
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:25,900
you know, they didn't expect the secret weapon, you know, the, um, the, you know, that he was supposed to be, like, our other DPS player that we, like, hid.

622
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:28,900
That's what I was saying.

623
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:29,900
Intel is key.

624
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:33,660
I didn't want to leak any of our, any of our strats.

625
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:34,860
I was like, hide your profiles.

626
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:36,500
Intel is so important in these.

627
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:44,920
This is why pro players, all pro players hide their match history because they don't want, like, and that's why pro players don't stream their scrims.

628
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:46,840
It's similar in any hero shooter.

629
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,320
Like, Overwatch, they do the same thing.

630
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:56,180
Because, you know, there's, like, a hidden black market for players leaking scrims to other teams and stuff like that.

631
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:59,860
Like, they'll be like, bro, you got that scrim.

632
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:03,040
Like, yo, bro, didn't you scrim this team last night?

633
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,920
Can we, like, borrow, can we watch that replay?

634
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:07,260
Like, like,

635
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:14,100
the dark web of, like, like, exchanging.

636
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:55,560
this team later that you're going to face in the in the tournament so we're like we can and and you know your face you scream that team and we're going to be facing them so like can we like you know like i'll give you our scrim vibe and our scrim replay and you guys give us your their scrim replay so like you know for it yeah it's like the intel war like like info swapping yeah exactly nothing is more valuable than information and i heard like other teams were also just Like what so that's why it's like private your profiles private your profiles and don't talk about what we're playing because obviously Maybe some one was like we don't want you know,

637
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:57,600
there's like chat hoppers and stuff like that.

638
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:46,280
So I was like worried about people like leaking our comms leaking the Our comps that we had so I was like, okay, I'm gonna do these bad guys look at I'm gonna type on type out our comps and stuff if this happens to you know have the comps we had because i was like no leaks no leaks it was best of one like like what can i do in that situation it's literally whoever has the most information wins a best of one because that is scary like i'm so happy we didn't get domination because i don't it's so hard to adjust in domination um Yeah,

639
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:57,540
so, I mean, we did get domination versus Amelie's team, but like I said, um, um, it was so, so close, because in domination, you have to adjust so fucking fast.

640
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:02,660
Um, yeah, um, but yeah, anyway, that was the tournament.

641
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,240
Yeah, I think that's everything about the tournament.

642
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,120
Yippee.

643
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:12,820
I am so tight.
