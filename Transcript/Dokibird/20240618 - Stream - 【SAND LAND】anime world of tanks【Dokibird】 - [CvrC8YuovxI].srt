00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,010
Guys!

2
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,830
The YouTube... Oh god, what the fuck was that voice crack?

3
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,010
Guys!

4
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,610
The YouTube servers are down on my side!

5
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,850
Every time I... I can't... I can't even go to my live studio!

6
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,130
Oh wait, no, never mind.

7
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,110
GK, it's okay now.

8
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,790
GK!

9
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,670
GK, it's fixed now.

10
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,550
Okay, I was saying that because I kept getting this!

11
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,250
I was like, what do you mean error try again?

12
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,530
What do you... What do you mean?

13
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,890
What does that mean?

14
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,870
And then I kept like refreshing and everything and then it wouldn't...

15
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,810
Like it wouldn't refresh.

16
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,850
I was so confused.

17
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,030
I was like, why can't I refresh?

18
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,530
I'm so confused.

19
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,470
Painful.

20
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,210
So I'll chat LMG.

21
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,290
Thank you for the super chat.

22
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,430
Thank you, Alan.

23
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,830
Alright, so for those who don't know.

24
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,050
For those who don't know...

25
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,590
The store DokiMerch is finally open!

26
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,150
Now there's headers!

27
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,130
Guys!

28
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,030
We have headers now!

29
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,630
Like, we don't really have any new...

30
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:11,630
Yes, I know, a lot of the items in the store is sold out.

31
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,650
Because we're working on it.

32
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,150
We have two orders until we're able to fulfill the majority of the orders.

33
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,150
Another update.

34
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,310
So yes, Croquis voice pack.

35
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,930
Our very first voice pack is out now.

36
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:08,130
You can listen to the preview of the Dokimers store of what it sounds like.

37
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,330
I just want you to know Croquis worked very hard in that voice pack.

38
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,110
So yes, check it out.

39
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:21,910

42
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,890
Just to entice you guys more.

43
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,690
I was like, oh my god.

44
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,590
For only $4.99 you can get your Croquis voice pack.

45
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,810
Nova, thank you for the gifted membership.

46
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,850
Thank you, thank you.

47
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,090
And Kova, thank you for the five gifted ships.

48
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,130
Thank you, thank you.

49
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,110
I really appreciate it.

50
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,650
Thank you guys.

51
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,950
So anyway, I am... yes, I am not tired.

52
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,570
Or I mean, I'm a little bit tired.

53
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,070
To be fair, I started my work day at fucking 10 in the morning.

54
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,630
I'm sipping my appy juice right now.

55
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:03,210
You know, like those like... those like paper... the paper apple juice containers.

56
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,110
Like as if I'm in kindergarten.

57
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,850
This is how I feel like right now mentally.

58
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,010
I'm sipping my little like kindergarten apple juice.

59
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,030
Love that first caw.

60
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,710
And also thank you for the super chat.

61
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,730
Thank you, thank you.

62
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,610
Regarding like... you're like, Doki, when will we have Croquis merch?

63
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,730
I am currently talking with the creators at the moment of Croquis.

64
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,710
Because like, I don't know if people realize this.

65
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,590
I talked about this in the... in the 3D stream.

66
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:48,850
And it was more so... it was more so of like... Croquis was based off of a free crow model that they made.

67
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,570
And I said that like, oh, I saw it on Twitter.

68
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,310
I saw this free crow model that this creator made.

69
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,430
And I thought it was super cute.

70
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,010
So then I was like, oh, can you do one... design one for me?

71
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,970
That's just like me, like based off of me.

72
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,690
And they're like, yeah, they can.

73
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,250
But because the model is sort of like free for everybody.

74
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,450
Um...

75
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,670
Uh, like the original model is free for everybody to download.

76
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,810
Uh, which in talks at the moment regarding making merch off of Croquis.

77
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,070
Because it is based on her original... her other original model.

78
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,190
So let's... fingers crossed.

79
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,050
Um, like she was open to the idea.

80
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:30,510
But like obviously we have to like negotiate and stuff about like how to... to do... uh...

81
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,870
To use it like commercially.

82
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,190
So we are currently like negotiating.

83
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,170
Um, to see like... uh...

84
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,710
Um, um, like what we can do.

85
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,650
With regarding Croquis and what we can...

86
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,410
You already missed your oh she...

87
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,090
Bro, Croquis was...

88
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,870
Look, Croquis was made as...

89
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,870
Was like really made as a one-off joke.

90
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,550
I honestly...

91
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,610
I honestly did not expect Croquis to like...

92
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,910
Blow up...

93
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,990
Uh...

94
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,310
Blow up in the way it did.

95
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,430
Like sort of like overnight.

96
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,190
But I'm really glad all of you guys...

97
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,030
Love Croquis.

98
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,510
Who not?

99
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,950
Welcome to the tomato farm.

100
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,770
Welcome, welcome.

101
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,710
Um...

102
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,250
Croquis is my favorite.

103
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,530
The Dokiverse.

104
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,730
Which is your favorite Doki, guys?

105
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,930
There's so many different flavors of Doki.

106
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,390
Which one's your favorite?

107
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,130
Um...

108
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,010
Oh, fuck.

109
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,530
Okay, anyway.

110
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,310
So yes, I started my day at 10 in the morning.

111
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,350
Um...

112
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:52,570
Because almost every day I have to attend an interview regarding our new manager slash talent manager position.

113
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,690
Um...

114
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,970
Because our staff team, we have hired everybody for our staff team except for manager.

115
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,710
The other staff positions were pretty easy to fill.

116
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,550
Um...

117
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,990
Because we sort of have like a vision of what we want to do.

118
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,790
But a main manager slash talent manager is quite difficult.

119
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,210
Because, uh...

120
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,110
You know, we want somebody that...

121
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,610
Like we want to make sure we don't, you know, fuck up.

122
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,370
We don't...

123
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,530
Because like it's a lot of responsibility.

124
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,970
And it's like there's a lot of work going into...

125
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,530
Going into like the main manager slash talent manager position.

126
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,250
So we gotta find somebody that's perfect.

127
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,970
Because I didn't have to attend any of the interviews.

128
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,310
For the other positions.

129
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:36,770
Um...

130
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,890
And it was a very like...

131
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,690
Uh...

132
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,150
Well, okay, we didn't really...

133
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,250
We didn't have interviews for the other staff positions.

134
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,710
The manager positions where we do have interviews.

135
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,890
Because this was very important.

136
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,450
For the events and the product management.

137
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,870
It's very like clean cut on like what we wanted.

138
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,990
And like the resumes we received.

139
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,850
And like we...

140
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,910
Like we...

141
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,730
We want...

142
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,490
There was like...

143
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,710
We had like exactly the vision we want.

144
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,410
And because of that it was very easy to hire for...

145
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:03,950
Um...

146
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,570
The positions.

147
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,470
For those positions.

148
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:06,770
Um...

149
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,990
But the main manager, talent manager is where it gets a little harder.

150
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,750
Not a little.

151
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,350
Very hard.

152
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,630
Because we don't want to mess up in that area.

153
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,790
Because they have a lot of power.

154
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,550
Uh...

155
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,430
Obviously I'm the main power here.

156
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,370
I want this talent manager to be able to do things.

157
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,710
So that I don't have to be involved in behind the scenes work and stuff.

158
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,830
So I can just say yes or no to things.

159
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,130
Because I'm like the final decision.

160
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:32,890
Because it's me.

161
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,790
Anyway.

162
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,030
Um...

163
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,190
So like almost every day for the past week or so.

164
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,470
Starting on like you know last Monday.

165
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,370
I think last Sunday.

166
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,590
I've been having to wake up at like 10.30.

167
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:48,650
Uh...

168
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,430
10.30 a.m.

169
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,490
Um...

170
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,250
Almost.

171
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,190
Or 10 a.m.

172
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,170
Depending on like if I woke up at 10 a.m.

173
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:55,590
I'll just...

174
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,850
I'll just keep at it.

175
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,410
I'll just be like okay I'll just stay up till the interview.

176
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,790
Because all our interviews are like at 11 a.m.

177
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,090
for me.

178
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,870
And so like I had to like...

179
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,970
You know I have to go and sit on the interviews and stuff.

180
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,230
Just to be like if I like the person or not.

181
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,410
Because they'll have to be like...

182
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,730
Like I don't like you know it'll be awkward to the interview this person.

183
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,590
And then...

184
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,930
And then you know they hire them.

185
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,390
And then I hear them for the first time.

186
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,830
And I get like a weird vibe.

187
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,770
It'll be like...

188
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,910
Ugh I don't know.

189
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,870
Like after they get hired.

190
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,650
So like I have to...

191
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,450
I have to be there for her.

192
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,210
Because I always trust my gut on things.

193
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,490
Like my gut hasn't really failed me so far regarding like who to trust.

194
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,130
Regarding like people to hang out with.

195
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,510
Who I trust.

196
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,730
I always trust my gut.

197
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,250
Like my gut feeling on people.

198
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,370
And so like that's why I have to be there in the interview.

199
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,370
And like I don't talk.

200
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,110
I mute myself.

201
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,070
I just listen in.

202
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,850
I'm like an observer.

203
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,270
And we have somebody that does the interview for us.

204
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,850
And so like every time.

205
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,430
Almost every day since last week.

206
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,410
I have to wake up so early.

207
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,730
I'm not used to it.

208
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,350
I'm not used to it at all.

209
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,850
And we have a whole month of this to go.

210
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,730
Because we have to do a second interview after the first interview.

211
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,490
After...

212
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,570
Because we're doing the first interview.

213
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,090
And we're cutting the pool in like...

214
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:31,330
We're cutting the pool in like more than half obviously.

215
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,750
And then we're going to do a second interview.

216
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,810
And then if they pass the second.

217
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,810
Then the second interview is when I actually make my decision.

218
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,230
But we're still in the first step.

219
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,410
We're still in the first interview step at the moment.

220
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,750
And obviously after the interviews.

221
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,770
We have to...

222
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,170
We have to like...

223
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,790
Go through our notes.

224
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,010
Being like what we felt.

225
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,550
Like me and the interviewer.

226
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,570
Be like okay how do we...

227
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,890
How we feel about this.

228
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,690
And everything.

229
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,350
And...

230
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,930
And all that.

231
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,430
Oh my gosh.

232
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,250
Your show is so much work.

233
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,770
So yeah.

234
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,730
That's why I was late.

235
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,750
I was in a staff meeting.

236
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,490
Regarding talking about the interview we just...

237
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,130
Because like it's an hour too.

238
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,630
The interview lasts an hour.

239
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,950
So like after the interview is done.

240
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,050
We have to do notes and stuff.

241
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,390
And then it was like 12.15.

242
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,450
And I was like fuck.

243
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,410
Because we have to release the store.

244
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,970
Because I wanted to.

245
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,790
I had...

246
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,150
You know.

247
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,710
We planned on opening the store before my stream.

248
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,170
So I was like oh my gosh.

249
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:33,910
Anyway.

250
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,050
The shift our meeting.

251
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,330
Because we have like our other staff members are in the meeting as well.

252
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,130
So like I was like alright time to shift the meeting.

253
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,590
To the store.

254
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,710
And then we were talking about the store.

255
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,470
And then we had to make sure everything is good to go.

256
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,050
We know that one of the Twitch analytics is broken on the store.

257
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,210
But that's not on our end.

258
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,670
That's on the analytics website.

259
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,650
So...

260
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,730
So we had to...

261
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,890
We had to like...

262
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,510
We had to like go and get that ready.

263
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,310
So that's why I was late.

264
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,930
Oh my god.

265
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,650
I have to go to meetings again guys.

266
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,310
But this time I'm the boss.

267
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,570
But yeah.

268
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:23,970
Anyway.

269
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,830
I saw some of you were like what about Mr. Mel?

270
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,710
I talked about it.

271
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,970
I've talked about it before.

272
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,690
But Mr. Mel is taking a step back.

273
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,290
They are not working on as the main manager anymore.

274
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,850
They're working on like getting contractual work.

275
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,030
So like basically bringing in sponsors.

276
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,430
Bringing in like contracts and stuff.

277
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,810
So we're moving on to like as an agent type deal.

278
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,070
Because agents work on sponsors.

279
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,830
And then they take commissions off of the sponsors that they bring in.

280
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,270
So because of that we are in a transition period at the moment.

281
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,250
So Mr. Mel is working on being more so outside.

282
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,330
Duties.

283
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:08,790
And Mr. Mel has always been working on this as a side.

284
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,490
Because Mr. Mel has like another job.

285
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,330
Like a main job.

286
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,710
I've always...

287
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,930
I've been like a side gig type deal.

288
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,010
Because Mr. Mel...

289
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,570
If you don't know.

290
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,670
Mr. Mel actually has a main job.

291
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,830
And I was taking it as a side.

292
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,150
To help me get started.

293
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,670
Type deal.

294
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,990
Because you know I fucking started Doki Bird.

295
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,670
Sorry not started Doki Bird.

296
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,310
Returned to Doki Bird.

297
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,850
I returned to Doki Bird.

298
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,110
With basically like zero prep.

299
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,450
Like you know I barely had time to really prep for all of this.

300
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,210
So Mr. Mel helped with getting...

301
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,450
Making sure like you know.

302
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,170
I had like some sort of structure going in.

303
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,850
And now...

304
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,950
Now that like you know.

305
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,710
We've had like...

306
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,470
We're trying to build the structure now.

307
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,430
And Mr. Mel doesn't have a lot of time to really like dedicate fully to this.

308
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,270
So we're looking to...

309
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,250
So that's why he decided it was time to step back.

310
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,570
It was his decision to step back.

311
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,770
And we agreed that like...

312
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,330
He'll be working more so on outside.

313
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,490
Outside rather than...

314
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,330
Instead of like inside...

315
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,270
I won't say inside the company.

316
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,930
I meant more so like in...

317
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,030
Like you know what I mean.

318
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,170
And so he's...

319
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,810
So that's why we're hiring a main...

320
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,590
A main manager.

321
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,130
A main talent manager.

322
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,670
To work on this like full time.

323
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,270
Type deal.

324
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:54,770
And...

325
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,530
And so because of that.

326
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,590
That's why we've been hiring and stuff.

327
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:00,770
And...

328
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,470
So we need somebody who can commit more time to...

329
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,530
To Doki Bird.

330
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:05,990
To me.

331
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,730
And being able to...

332
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,030
Because I also have to do a lot of behind the scenes stuff.

333
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:10,810
Right now.

334
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,050
And we're trying to avoid that.

335
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,750
Like...

336
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,790
So I can focus more so on streaming.

337
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,250
And I...

338
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,750
All I really want to do is focus more on streaming.

339
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,570
And my creative...

340
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,030
My creative ventures.

341
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,670
Like my projects and stuff like that.

342
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,670
And so we need to hire somebody that's...

343
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,850
Can handle more behind the scenes.

344
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,670
So like...

345
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,310
To the point where I just need to say yes or no to things.

346
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,750
Like I don't really want to...

347
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,390
You know...

348
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,990
I don't really want to do behind the scenes stuff.

349
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,910
I don't really like...

350
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,990
Now I don't want to say I don't like doing behind the scenes stuff.

351
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,610
But like...

352
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,170
I'm...

353
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,330
I'm tired.

354
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,950
I think that's the best way to describe it.

355
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,530
I am tired.

356
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,730
And I just want a stream.

357
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,330
So that's why.

358
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,810
That's my goal.

359
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,090
That's honestly my goal.

360
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,450
Let's see.

361
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,650
Because like every day...

362
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,470
Every day I basically...

363
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,210
Before stream and after stream I just work.

364
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,130
I don't really have time to play video games nowadays.

365
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,490
Like off stream.

366
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,870
The only time I do get to play video games is when I'm streaming.

367
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,410
Because every day I'm always working on something.

368
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,350
Regarding...

369
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,790
Regarding like within the...

370
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,690
We'll just call it the company.

371
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,090
I don't know what else to call it.

372
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,370
Every day I'm like working on something within the company.

373
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,670
And like trying to...

374
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,530
Like I am a workaholic.

375
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,090
But like the workaholic sometimes...

376
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,970
Like as a workaholic...

377
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,510
I take most enjoyment in like working on my channel.

378
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,530
In terms of like stream content.

379
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,750
And like projects.

380
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,250
I don't mean like...

381
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,590
The behind the scenes logistics and stuff.

382
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,690
Is where I...

383
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,050
Don't consider...

384
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,170
The workaholic part.

385
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,030
The workaholic part doesn't really include much about like the paperwork.

386
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,870
And the...

387
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,250
The behind the scenes and the...

388
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,030
And the logistics of everything.

389
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,570
That's not where my workaholic tendency goes into.

390
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,150
But sadly I have to work on these things almost every day.

391
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,130
So...

392
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,070
So when I say I've been very busy.

393
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,230
I've been very busy.

394
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,650
So that's basically where it's at at the moment.

395
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:03,570
Yay!

396
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,230
Anyway.

397
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,230
What else do I have to give updates on?

398
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,670
Um...

399
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,150
Yeah.

400
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,430
Like I know like we're growing a lot.

401
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,310
To our team is...

402
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,910
Our team is...

403
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,170
This is growing a lot at the moment.

404
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,450
And I don't know if it will be something that we can have forever if I'll have this big of a team.

405
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,350
Forever.

406
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,030
Because I don't know what next year is going to be like.

407
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,830
This year... This year is like... It's been very good to me.

408
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,830
I think as long as now that we have the store out.

409
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,730
I'll say that a lot of the salary has been helped by...

410
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,790
You know, you guys... Of course, you guys are supporting me.

411
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:52,470
But like... Now that we have our official store out and we got a distributor going in.

412
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,650
We can finally... If we start launching more products more regularly.

413
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,050
That most of the salary...

414
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,230
I think like majority of the salary can be paid off with our merch sales.

415
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,710
Which is great!

416
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,470
I really want to say thank you again, guys.

417
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,670
Like, it's crazy how much merch can... Like...

418
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,830
Like, it's crazy!

419
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,190
Like I said...

420
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,790
If I had regular merch sales...

421
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,410
The merch sales could account for like 60-70% of my salary...

422
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,570
Of like... Of my income type deal.

423
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:31,570
Like, because merchandising is... Like...

424
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,730
Like, you know how like... Like, Hasbin Hotel...

425
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,630
Pop... What was it?

426
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,870
The Poppy Circus, whatever.

427
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,210
Like, that shit.

428
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,770
Like, merchandising really fucking...

429
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,350
Can make a lot of money for stuff.

430
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,050
And they're... They're right!

431
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,630
It does!

432
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,230
It's actually crazy how much you can actually...

433
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,230
Make out of just merchandising.

434
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,330
And...

435
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,950
And...

436
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,850
But yes, the store doesn't really have anything new.

437
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,830
The only thing new is the KuroKy voice pack.

438
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,270
Plus, I think we only have the Doki Makura...

439
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,070
Only...

440
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,990
We... We really only have...

441
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,650
The Doki Makura stock still in.

442
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,530
Cause...

443
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,130
I think like, apparently I ordered...

444
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,770
Too much of the Doki Makura.

445
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,710
So we have...

446
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,370
We have like...

447
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,890
We have like, sort of like... A little bit of...

448
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,250
An excess of it.

449
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,670
So that's why...

450
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,290
Like, we can ship it right away.

451
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,130
Because we have too much of...

452
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,370
I might have ordered a little bit too much.

453
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,750
So... So those can be...

454
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,250
Instantly shipped out.

455
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,430
So...

456
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,490
No, thank you for the super chat.

457
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,430
Thank you, thank you.

458
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,450
Genuine question.

459
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,590
Are you no longer...

460
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,450
A thief?

461
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,930
Are you considering overhauling the Doki Verse lore given how...

462
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,410
What do you mean?

463
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,110
The Doki Verse is the Doki Verse.

464
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,970
The Multi-verse is the Multi-verse.

465
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,330
Like I said, it is a skin suit.

466
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,510
Like, I can take my skin suit off at any times.

467
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,830
Each skin suit...

468
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,030
So you know how like...

469
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,190
Some people have like multiple passports.

470
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,710
With like multiple identities.

471
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,790
So that's me.

472
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:23,390
All we know as long as in the inside it's the tomato because like that's my true form So I could be like what do I feel like today?

473
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,570
Do I want to be a thief today?

474
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:31,230
I also feel like a lot of people forget that I'm a thief here Because I'm not very stealthy

475
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:46,830
So, you know if I'm on the run I could easily just take off my skin suit and put on a different skin suit So like it's like having multiple passports.

476
00:22:46,990 --> 00:23:02,710
So I have multiple passports like it's not identity fraud if it's my identity Guys, that's not what it means That's not what it means chat, that's not identity theft, it's my identity!

477
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,470
Let's see.

478
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,250
Then, thank you for the super chat.

479
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:11,590
Thank you.

480
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,370
Thank you after that train simulator stream.

481
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,550
I do not want to flame Doki, thank you for the super chat.

482
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:17,910
Thank you.

483
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,450
Thank you.

484
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,010
Also like okay.

485
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:36,470
It's really funny one of my Friends actually told me about this but like I need you guys like you guys really want lore of the tomato The tomato my true form Was made I was born out of spite

486
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:48,070
Only the bark knights will remember this

487
00:23:52,370 --> 00:24:11,990
Like the bark knights will remember this moment this stream I never revealed my true form until one stream where it was revealed and created out of pure spite It blew up so much.

488
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:19,250
I don't remember the full... I honestly don't remember the full thing of how it happened.

489
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,410
Because like, one of my friends brought it up.

490
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,790
Because we were talking about Croaky.

491
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:30,250
And we were like, oh yeah, I can't believe Croaky became such a big part of you already, like after your release.

492
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:38,650
And then... and then one of my friends was like, yeah, like, just like your true form, your true tomato form.

493
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,510
That was like a joke slash spite.

494
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,130
And I don't remember, I think it was something regarding like, um...

495
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:57,170
I think like, I was like, someone talked about how much they fucking hated tomatoes.

496
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,030
And then I started watching tomato videos.

497
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:00,910
On stream.

498
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,450
And then I was like, that's me!

499
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,550
And then I was just like, oh my god, guys, that's me!

500
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,470
And then I think like, I pissed somebody off.

501
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,030
I don't remember, I like, I pissed someone off.

502
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,250
Because I kept talking about tomatoes and stuff.

503
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,890
And then they got really mad about it.

504
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,310
And then I was just like, that's me!

505
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,210
I'm a tomato!

506
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,350
And then... and then like...

507
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,190
And then like, uh...

508
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,110
A couple months later, I think, and I just revealed it.

509
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,970
I was like, hey guys.

510
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,550
So I had this...

511
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,090
So I've actually been a tomato all this time.

512
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,430
I've had this tomato form lying around for like, a couple of months now.

513
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,850
I just... I just didn't know...

514
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,610
I just didn't know what to do with it.

515
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,430
And then I think I brought it out on the Apex stream.

516
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,050
Was it an Apex?

517
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,150
No!

518
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:53,610
Yeah!

519
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,290
Yeah!

520
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,690
I brought it out on Apex!

521
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,150
Out of nowhere!

522
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,990
I was just like, hey guys, anyway, here's my real form.

523
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:02,810
And then...

524
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,170
Yeah,

525
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,290
I just...

526
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:16,870
And then everybody was like, what the... what the fuck?

527
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,350
Like... like...

528
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,270
It's just like... wait...

529
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:27,270
You had this... you had this form laying around for like... like a couple of months.

530
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,970
And you just suddenly brought it... yeah.

531
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,350
Just casually just brought it up.

532
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,790
I just didn't know what to do.

533
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,710
Same with the croquis.

534
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,410
I had... I had it for a while.

535
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,490
I just didn't know...

536
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,810
When I could bring it up.

537
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,530
Because it was... I don't know.

538
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,810
I just thought it was a funny idea.

539
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,910
And I... I...

540
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,310
Sometimes I like... I like commission things.

541
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,990
Or like, I order things in advance.

542
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,450
I don't know what to do with it.

543
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,450
I just think it's really funny.

544
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,750
But like, I don't really have an idea.

545
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,770
I don't... I...

546
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,770
It's just that...

547
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,250
I don't have the idea.

548
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,770
I just thought it's funny.

549
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,030
And then like later on, I'll just be like...

550
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,670
Anyway...

551
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,990
Here... here it is.

552
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,050
I'll think of... I'll be like...

553
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,690
Well, I have the reveal.

554
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,630
But like, I don't know how the fuck to... to segue to it.

555
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,290
But at least I have it.

556
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,410
Let's see.

557
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,810
Devlin, thank you for the super chat.

558
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,270
Thank you.

559
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:27,910
Thank you.

560
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,130
But yeah.

561
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,070
That's how...

562
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,610
Okay, similar to CROQI.

563
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:31,870
Alright.

564
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,670
Okay, guys.

565
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,310
Before we talk about CROQI more, let me show you guys other stuff, guys.

566
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:36,630
Look.

567
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,250
We...

568
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,150
We...

569
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,710
I feel like everybody forgot that I also debuted a chibi model.

570
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,530
I...

571
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:54,410
Everybody sort of forgot about the chibi model that also debuted, guys.

572
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,410
I don't know if you know this.

573
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:01,370
But we have also had more than just one debut chat.

574
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,090
We have also have other models too.

575
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,830
Such as the chibi model.

576
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,690
So, I'm gonna tell you guys the behind the scenes.

577
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,970
So, the chibi model.

578
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,870
We went through a lot of drafts for it.

579
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,570
Like I told you guys.

580
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,770
We went through like a couple of drafts regarding the chibi model.

581
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,530
So, this is what it originally looked like.

582
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,590
Like the first rough drawing.

583
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,570
Like I said, it's from Preachy.

584
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,150
And we worked with Preachy before.

585
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,950
And it was long.

586
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,670
So, I made some edits to it.

587
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,090
And in the end, it...

588
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,590
Yeah, it was like...

589
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,330
It was pretty long.

590
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,790
I was like, oh, I don't know.

591
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,010
I feel like I have like a fucking...

592
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,370
A six foot tall brain inside this four foot tall chibi.

593
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,290
So...

594
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,470
Long, young man.

595
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,730
And then later on, like this is where the edits got to.

596
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,470
We edited all the way to this.

597
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,910
So, it looks a lot better now.

598
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,270
Now, it's not as long.

599
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,810
Yeah, it looks like I'm Mega Man.

600
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,330
So, in the end, we edited all the way to this.

601
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,990
This was like the rough sketch.

602
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,050
Oh, and then some of you guys might recognize this.

603
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:18,830
I actually...

604
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:24,170
I actually gave a sneak peek of the...

605
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,750
Of the...

606
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,730
Chibi model.

607
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,730
A long time ago.

608
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,130
Because some of you guys might remember the screenshot in the member stream.

609
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,390
So...

610
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,990
That was actually came from the chibi model.

611
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,510
Yes.

612
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,370
The screenshot of...

613
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,250
I actually posted a little screenshot.

614
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,350
A crop screenshot of the eye.

615
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,930
And as like a sneak peek in members.

616
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:50,890
But like...

617
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:54,770
It was so funny because everybody thought it was the YouTube's figure.

618
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,670
When the YouTube's figure came up.

619
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,670
People were like...

620
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,490
Oh my god.

621
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,230
You were previewing the YouTube's figure in your members.

622
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,610
But jokes on you guys.

623
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,130
It was actually the chibi model.

624
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,550
That was actually the preview I posted in the members channel.

625
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,530
Give me this Mega Man blush.

626
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,510
Thank you for the super chat Gamma.

627
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:25,870
Thank you.

628
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,430
Thank you.

629
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,130
So yes.

630
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:27,630
It was...

631
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,250
That was the original...

632
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,810
That was the first preview I gave.

633
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,870
That people were like...

634
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,090
Huh.

635
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:40,670
And we had actually had like different styles going in.

636
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,230
We were like playing around with different eyes.

637
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,850
So this was the original concept.

638
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,930
What the eyes originally looked like.

639
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,050
I will show you guys.

640
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,310
This is actually what the original...

641
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,330
The original eyes looked like.

642
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,050
I was not...

643
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:57,550
Sorry.

644
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:57,930
Wait.

645
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,350
You're just gonna see my hat poking up above.

646
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,930
I wasn't really feeling the eyes in particular.

647
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,030
Because I felt like...

648
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,990
It just felt a little bit off.

649
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,790
So like I asked...

650
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,030
So we were going through like...

651
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,210
So many different like...

652
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,550
Eye designs.

653
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,970
Because like...

654
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,550
I'm a huge perfectionist.

655
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,070
When it comes to these things.

656
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,690
So we were going through like...

657
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,010
A lot of like...

658
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,650
Like...

659
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,290
Being like...

660
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:31,790
Oh...

661
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,450
I want to fix the eyes.

662
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,630
Like this is the only issue...

663
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,950
That I had there.

664
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,210
So we were like going through different eyes and stuff.

665
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,170
So this is another...

666
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,830
Eye concept we had.

667
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,590
Where we removed the bottom of it.

668
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,870
And then we had...

669
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,850
This version.

670
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,710
Where it's like...

671
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,970
Black pupils and everything.

672
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,650
And then...

673
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,430
I didn't really...

674
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,290
I was like...

675
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,490
What do I look like with black pupils?

676
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,210
And I was like...

677
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:56,890
Oh god.

678
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,510
I look like I'm staring into your fucking soul.

679
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,390
So...

680
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,750
So I was like...

681
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,270
Oh...

682
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,090
Maybe...

683
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,850
Maybe not.

684
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,490
Because I look like...

685
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,070
I'm staring into your fucking soul right now.

686
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,370
With those black eyes.

687
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,790
So then we were like...

688
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:12,950
Okay.

689
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,270
Why don't we do like...

690
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:14,810
Something like this.

691
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,670
Not the black eyes.

692
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,170
But...

693
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,330
Um...

694
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:17,710
Like...

695
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,050
With the pupils being a dark green.

696
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,330
And...

697
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,570
I don't know.

698
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:24,550
I don't know...

699
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,030
And then...

700
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,250
We finally settled with...

701
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,230
Uh...

702
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,030
We finally...

703
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,390
After all of that...

704
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,950
We settled with...

705
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,410
What we have here.

706
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,770
So...

707
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,730
This was...

708
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,750
Uh...

709
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,990
This is what we settled with.

710
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,730
Because I thought...

711
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,350
It would look...

712
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,070
The best.

713
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,430
But then it wasn't over.

714
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,150
I was like...

715
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:43,450
No.

716
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,450
We gotta remove the bottom part.

717
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,210
The bottom part doesn't look that great.

718
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,130
And...

719
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,210
And so, in the end... Boom!

720
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,370
That was the eye style we went with.

721
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,070
You see all these?

722
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:02,370
It's just small little changes can affect a model so much.

723
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:08,870
Because I felt like, you know, you can see from this, it really changed how...

724
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,590
Oh wait, sorry.

725
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,890
It really changed how it looked in general.

726
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:24,110
From the little eyeliner in the bottom can turn into something...

727
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,490
You know, just change how it looked in general.

728
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:31,950
So that's... Like I said, I'm a huge perfectionist when it comes to this.

729
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,910
I'm a huge stickler for details.

730
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,870
And, you know, I want something that...

731
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,250
Looks like, you know, appealing.

732
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:50,650
So...

733
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,390
This is where we ended off on.

734
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,410
And it gives off such a different vibe.

735
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,630
It makes it a lot cuter.

736
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,450
So it went from...

737
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,270
So original all the way to the end.

738
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,410
Let me show you the original again.

739
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:11,130
It's crazy how far the design process was for this.

740
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,490
It was a lot back and forth.

741
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,730
I really appreciate Preachy for like...

742
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,570
For willing to, you know...

743
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,450
What's the word?

744
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,790
For willing to like...

745
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,710
Go through with the back and forth and the attention to detail and everything.

746
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,450
So it went from...

747
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,290
Let me save this real fast.

748
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,610
Sorry, my English today is extra fucked up.

749
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,430
My brain is like still booting up at the moment.

750
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,770
So my brain today is extra slow.

751
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,030
So this is the original.

752
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,290
Oh my gosh.

753
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,010
From the original which was super long.

754
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,310
To...

755
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,830
To this.

756
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,790
So...

757
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,330
Yeah.

758
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,430
A lot changed.

759
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,630
Oh my god.

760
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,150
Yeah.

761
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,430
A lot definitely changed.

762
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,150
To get to where we're at.

763
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,110
From big brain to...

764
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,170
To something that truly reflects my bird brain.

765
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,090
Yeah.

766
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,150
It's actually crazy.

767
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,330
While I was working on the new...

768
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,250
While I was working on the new skin suit.

769
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,190
While I was like talking to...

770
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,210
Our...

771
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,290
You know...

772
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,130
What's the word?

773
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,890
So we have a skin suit designer.

774
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,410
And then what would you call somebody that makes a skin suit move?

775
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,350
Like...

776
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:36,750
You know...

777
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,830
I don't know.

778
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,390
I don't know.

779
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:39,730
I don't know.

780
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,210
I guess like the skin suit tech.

781
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,770
Okay.

782
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,110
And then the skin suit tech guy.

783
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,390
The skin...

784
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,790
The puppeteer.

785
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,070
The skin suit...

786
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,650
The skin suit engineer.

787
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,830
Yes.

788
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,010
The engineer.

789
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,690
So I was talking to the skin suit engineer.

790
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,530
So that they are...

791
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,590
They can help build the skin suit up.

792
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,250
So the tomato form can easily go into it.

793
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,910
So the skin suit engineer.

794
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,310
I was talking to her.

795
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,270
And I was like...

796
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,750
Being...

797
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,810
Giving me like critiques and stuff.

798
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,350
Being like...

799
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,530
Yeah, we should swap this.

800
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,790
And then she was like...

801
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,010
Wow!

802
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,450
Like I didn't even notice that.

803
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,170
You have like...

804
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,590
Like really close...

805
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:19,850
Like...

806
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,870
Like good...

807
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,310
Like eye on things.

808
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,530
When it comes to attention to detail.

809
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,370
And stuff like that.

810
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,750
So like...

811
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,650
I...

812
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,750
I'm a huge perfectionist.

813
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,390
Like I said.

814
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,290
So...

815
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,190
I really want things to look good.

816
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,030
So that was the before and after to how...

817
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,250
How we got there.

818
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:43,770
Oh yeah!

819
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,670
You should see like...

820
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,270
My edit.

821
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,950
Like I would like actually edit the...

822
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,190
Like the work in progress that were sent to me.

823
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,130
So like...

824
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,270
This is like what I sent...

825
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,250
I'll show you guys what like I sent back to her.

826
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,950
For the 3D.

827
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,810
So this is like what I sent back to her.

828
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,450
I was like...

829
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:58,770
Oh!

830
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,590
I don't know.

831
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,630
It feels like...

832
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,610
Too long.

833
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,310
So...

834
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,050
And then I would send this back to her too.

835
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,190
I would send this back to Preachy.

836
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,890
On like how I think...

837
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,570
Because I thought the arms were too long.

838
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,670
As well.

839
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,590
So I edited the arms.

840
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,870
And I made like the body...

841
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,630
Like a little bit shorter.

842
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,670
Because I thought the body was too long too.

843
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,510
So I like squished up various parts.

844
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,950
And proportionate and everything.

845
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,470
And...

846
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,050
So it was like more so of...

847
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,190
A back and forth to get to where we're at.

848
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,730
And then I think I did like another back and forth too.

849
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,770
So then after they edit it...

850
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,730
I would be like...

851
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:36,870
Okay.

852
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,450
I want to edit again.

853
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,870
And then we would do another edit.

854
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,890
And then where it gets closer and closer to like the original...

855
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,410
To like what we have today.

856
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,710
Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

857
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,050
Thank you.

858
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:50,570
Thank you.

859
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,370
Anyone else not buying into this?

860
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,030
Obviously she has a pit in the basement where she keeps her victim.

861
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,250
I don't know what you're talking about.

862
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,970
I don't know what you're talking about, man.

863
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,530
Thank you for the super chat.

864
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:05,950
Thank you.

865
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,590
Thank you.

866
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,250
So...

867
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:08,770
Yeah.

868
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,350
So...

869
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,730
It was a lot of like back and forth and stuff.

870
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,730
And finally, the plushy design was actually...

871
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,330
So easy.

872
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,910
Because we sort of like...

873
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,210
Had a...

874
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,590
Since we already have the...

875
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,590
You know, we had like the model done.

876
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:33,390
The plushy design was very like intuitive on what we really wanted.

877
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,570
And...

878
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,250
I'll show you guys.

879
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,670
So at first, we just went like...

880
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,730
We were thinking like, oh, just smile.

881
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,130
But then I was like, no, open mouth.

882
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,750
I really wanted to be open mouth.

883
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:47,110
So then we went from this to this.

884
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,550
And I was like, no teeth.

885
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,410
We need teeth.

886
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,470
Because I don't want to be like mushy baby mouth.

887
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,990
You know, we're like...

888
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,210
It's weird.

889
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,710
There's no teeth there.

890
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,610
It's just weird.

891
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,470
So then we added teeth.

892
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,990
Because I don't know.

893
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,530
I just thought it was weird that it was like fucking...

894
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,790
Like some fucking...

895
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,050
Baby with no teeth, you know?

896
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,430
So we went from this to this.

897
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,590
And that was like basically how...

898
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:28,010
What the final form looks like in the end.

899
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,450
And it was very easy.

900
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,650
It was just like small changes.

901
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,870
It was just the mouth and everything.

902
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,170
In the end, it looked like this.

903
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,750
In the end, we had this.

904
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,290
So yeah.

905
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:43,310
Like I said, I don't like having really long delays when it comes to merch.

906
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,570
Because the one biggest issues I have with that...

907
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,050
Like in the future, there will be pre-orders.

908
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,070
But I'm going to try and minimize the pre-order dates.

909
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:58,850
Because the worst part about like pre-ordering stuff as a consumer is the very long wait.

910
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,690
And then like, you know, people move.

911
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,650
A lot of people move.

912
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,250
And it's also a huge...

913
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,570
It's like a huge deal to handle on the distributor side.

914
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:09,230
Because they have to like handle on where people are going to be moving.

915
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,410
And changing the addresses.

916
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,450
And some people canceling orders and stuff like that.

917
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,150
Or like they forget they ordered something like this.

918
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,410
And then or like it's just too much.

919
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,670
So I won't...

920
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,050
And then, you know, manufacturing delays happen.

921
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,530
Like right now, I have the Lunar New Year stuff.

922
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,710
There is a manufacturer delay with the Lunar New Year stuff.

923
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,170
Because we had a little error in production.

924
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:43,470
And because of that, I'm not planning on opening pre-orders for this until the majority of the process is done.

925
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,610
And more so.

926
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,630
And then like we can put pre-orders for it later.

927
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,310
We can order like, you know, we have like a set amount ordered.

928
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,750
And then we'll pre-order.

929
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,610
And if there's extra, if there's excess, then we'll have...

930
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,170
We'll order more at another time.

931
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,030
But yeah.

932
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,510
So it's a bitch.

933
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:11,030
And it's actually like such a bitch to deal with when it comes to like changing of addresses and everything.

934
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,090
And also...

935
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,730
Well, not like a bitch to deal with.

936
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,550
But like more so like it's a lot of work to deal with.

937
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,250
Because when there's a pre-order going in.

938
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,510
And we...

939
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,190
Because like, you know, one or two person changing of address.

940
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,650
Very easy to handle.

941
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,890
Like you just make a note of it in the order sheet.

942
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,310
But when we have a lot of people, like, you know.

943
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,830
Like, you know, people have lives.

944
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,850
I don't know if you know this.

945
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,490
But I think you guys are not bots.

946
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,290
And there's actually like real people watching me.

947
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,070
And you real people have lives outside of me.

948
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:46,990
So...

949
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:57,170
So I assume you guys will have, you know, you guys will have to move.

950
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,030
Or you guys will be doing other stuff, you know.

951
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,290
So I know like somebody would say like...

952
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,870
Oh, but we're YouTuber fans.

953
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,410
So we know how long it takes sometimes.

954
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,390
Guys, please respect yourself more.

955
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,230
Like, it's like...

956
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:24,410
Okay, so it's more so of like I want people to be...

957
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:27,250
Like I don't want that to be like a norm.

958
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,670
You know?

959
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,190
Like I don't want that to be like a norm for my store.

960
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:37,810
Because...

961
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,490
Like somebody's like I have merch I waited over a year for.

962
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,090
Yeah, but I feel like...

963
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:48,270
I feel like that shouldn't be like the norm in things.

964
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,690
Like I understand for...

965
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,830
For things like figures and stuff like that.

966
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,990
Like that I understand.

967
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,250
Because figures, obviously.

968
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,210
They take like...

969
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:03,710
They...

970
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,630
Like manufacturing cost for figures.

971
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:07,810
It's a lot.

972
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,470
And you know, they're hand painted and everything.

973
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,290
But I feel like small things like this.

974
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,150
Because I've waited...

975
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:18,010
I've waited a year plus for figures and stuff.

976
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:18,690
Which I understand.

977
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,930
Because figures is like much more...

978
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,370
There's more like manufacturing into it.

979
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:25,570
And...

980
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,350
And stuff like that.

981
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,350
So I understand.

982
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,170
Because a lot of them are like hand painted.

983
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:31,690
And everything.

984
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,410
So to deal with the order process.

985
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,310
But I feel like smaller things like this.

986
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,490
I'm willing...

987
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,150
I don't want to have like long pre-order times.

988
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,450
Because they are like...

989
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:44,850
Smaller.

990
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,870
And like...

991
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:49,530
And...

992
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,270
And you know...

993
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,470
I don't want you guys to have buyer regret.

994
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,170
After like half a year.

995
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,390
Of waiting.

996
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,130
Like you waited half a year.

997
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,310
And you're just like...

998
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,430
Why did I order this?

999
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,490
It's like...

1000
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,170
I don't want you to have buyer's regret.

1001
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,530
So I'd rather have like...

1002
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,670
Shorter pre-order time.

1003
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:15,930
Or like in a way.

1004
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:16,930
Or like...

1005
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,270
I don't...

1006
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,030
Or in a way where like...

1007
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,630
You...

1008
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,550
You don't have to wait too long.

1009
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,950
To receive your product.

1010
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,150
But because we're still...

1011
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:25,450
You know...

1012
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:25,970
Like right now.

1013
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,110
That's why I'm not opening new orders for stuff.

1014
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:28,950
Because I want to make sure.

1015
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:30,350
Um...

1016
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,950
I want to make sure that...

1017
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:34,430
Um...

1018
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:34,910
Oh yeah.

1019
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:35,230
Yeah.

1020
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:35,850
By Sonya...

1021
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,030
Yeah.

1022
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:36,950
Easier to make.

1023
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,050
Easier to make.

1024
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,970
Like I understand like figures taking a really fucking long time.

1025
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,350
And stuff like that.

1026
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,110
But I feel like...

1027
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,010
These things.

1028
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:44,650
Like you know...

1029
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,550
Like acrylic stands.

1030
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,410
Fucking plushies.

1031
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,070
Okay.

1032
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,150
Plushies does take a lot.

1033
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,330
But it's also...

1034
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,330
Plushies taking a lot.

1035
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,850
Is also due to the fact of...

1036
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,930
The process of making it into a real product.

1037
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,410
Like a real full-sized product and stuff.

1038
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:58,930
So...

1039
00:44:58,930 --> 00:44:59,730
Um...

1040
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,490
And...

1041
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,450
And I want to make sure that...

1042
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,150
You know...

1043
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,070
It is...

1044
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,050
Like...

1045
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,070
This looks...

1046
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,390
This is gonna look like what I see.

1047
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,110
Like...

1048
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,550
This can look good in a 3D for...

1049
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:16,650
Like...

1050
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,770
Like shit like that.

1051
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:24,050
Like I want to be sure that I will be able to actually produce this before I make you guys...

1052
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,350
I don't want you guys to pre-order a PNG.

1053
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,590
And then...

1054
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:28,910
So...

1055
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,510
So you know like...

1056
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,970
And it looks like a fucking bootleg.

1057
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:33,990
You know like those like...

1058
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,330
Like okay you know like those like nendoroid plushies?

1059
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,630
Where um...

1060
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,970
There's like a bootleg version of the nendoroid plushie.

1061
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,270
And then you look at the...

1062
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,730
You look like...

1063
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,250
Oh that like the PNG of it.

1064
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,130
And then like yeah the PNG pre-order.

1065
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:49,010
And then when it goes into like the actual plushie.

1066
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,330
It...

1067
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,430
It looks like...

1068
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,010
It's like...

1069
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,950
And then you bought like a bootleg version and stuff.

1070
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:56,330
And it's just not what you think it looks like.

1071
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,090
Okay let's see.

1072
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,710
Bootleg nendoroid plushie.

1073
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,850
Oh my gosh the knock-off shit is...

1074
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:05,530
Oh no like...

1075
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,110
Oh I think the best exam...

1076
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,030
Okay yeah like...

1077
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,250
Wait that's so good.

1078
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,790
This is such a good example.

1079
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,850
Wait I need to show you guys.

1080
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:14,510
Okay.

1081
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,610
Wait this is actually such a funny example.

1082
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,470
Alright I don't want it...

1083
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:20,650
I don't want it to...

1084
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,130
Oh my god what the fuck?

1085
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,050
I'm just...

1086
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,150
I've been looking at the knock-off.

1087
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:27,210
So...

1088
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,430
So like this is...

1089
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:34,430
I don't want my plushie to look like the one on the right guys.

1090
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,490
I don't want it...

1091
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:41,150
I want my plushie to look like the same quality as the last.

1092
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,790
I don't want it to look like the one on the right.

1093
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,470
Oh my god wait I can...

1094
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,110
I'll show you guys.

1095
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:48,910
Okay so like...

1096
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,330
So my friends are making plushies and stuff.

1097
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:51,610
Wait.

1098
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,290
Oh it's so funny.

1099
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,130
Wait I need to...

1100
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:55,370
I need to show you guys.

1101
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:55,770
Okay.

1102
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,330
So my friend...

1103
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:03,670
Two of my friends actually they recommend me the plushie manufacturer and it's so funny.

1104
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:04,870
Oh my god.

1105
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,950
Okay wait I need to show you guys the...

1106
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,750
It's so good.

1107
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,570
As in like it's so bad.

1108
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,990
So my friend is making...

1109
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,530
Wait I need to...

1110
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:24,790
Wait actually does she like...

1111
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:25,750
Also if I say...

1112
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,190
I suddenly...

1113
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:32,970
If my stream suddenly stops working I need you guys to know it's because the power's out.

1114
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:41,670
I forgot there's like power maintenance and stuff so if my power...

1115
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,410
Oh it's the internet.

1116
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,410
It's one or the other.

1117
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,990
It's either internet or power.

1118
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:48,590
I can't remember.

1119
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:49,530
I think it's internet.

1120
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:53,250
So like if I suddenly stopped streaming the internet cut off.

1121
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:53,730
So...

1122
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,870
I posted...

1123
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,790
So that's why I just disappeared.

1124
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:06,130
Yeah I heard that the chat is really weird though.

1125
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,070
I'm gonna see...

1126
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:13,370
Actually I don't know if I should show it yet because I don't know if she like ever announced these plushies so I gotta make sure.

1127
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,710
I gotta make sure that I'm not accidentally leaking anything.

1128
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:23,230
Because I remember asking like oh yeah can I show and she's like yeah like but I don't remember if she ever...

1129
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:29,850
Like showed these plushies yet to you guys like for like pre-order and stuff.

1130
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:30,930
I don't...

1131
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:36,730
I don't remember so I'm making sure I don't accidentally leak this out.

1132
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:40,410
Don't leak.

1133
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,530
I know I'm making sure I'm researching.

1134
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,310
I'm researching right now.

1135
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,410
Wait let's see if my other friend's online first.

1136
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,310
Okay.

1137
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:49,410
Oh wait.

1138
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,190
Shit okay.

1139
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:51,390
Oh.

1140
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,630
I'll ask her.

1141
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:55,990
Okay.

1142
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,050
Okay.

1143
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:04,630
I'm messaging.

1144
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,090
Okay.

1145
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,210
I'm trying to remember not to read the message out loud.

1146
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:17,530
Okay.

1147
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,650
Let's see.

1148
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:20,430
Oh.

1149
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,370
Oh.

1150
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,010
Alright.

1151
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,270
We won't show it until we get approval because I don't remember.

1152
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:27,830
I don't remember.

1153
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:28,870
That's the issue.

1154
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:29,830
I actually...

1155
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:30,970
Okay.

1156
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,630
I don't think I seen her tweet about it before.

1157
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:34,390
Wait has she?

1158
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:36,370
God damn it.

1159
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,410
I don't know guys.

1160
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:40,090
I don't know if she ever tweeted it out.

1161
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:45,540
I'm not leaking deep night.

1162
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,060
I'm a good person.

1163
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,860
I'm a good person.

1164
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,840
Alright I'm checking her Twitter right now to see if it's gonna leak or not.

1165
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,020
To see if she ever posted pictures of it.

1166
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:00,040
If she didn't post pictures of it, I'll wait until I get a reply back.

1167
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,820
But it's so... oh my god, I wish I...

1168
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,560
It's so fucking funny.

1169
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,680
Like, that's all I can say.

1170
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:09,340
Because like, you go from prototype to the finalized version...

1171
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,160
I just want to send that...

1172
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,860
To that one guy that's still waiting for Sandland.

1173
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,340
We're gonna get there!

1174
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,920
We'll get there soon!

1175
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,620
You had four other Sandland parts, let me...

1176
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,140
Don't worry, we'll get there soon.

1177
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,320
All the people here now waiting for Sandland.

1178
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,640
We'll get there soon!

1179
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,360
I couldn't make the behind the scenes its own thing, guys.

1180
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,520
There was just... there was like too many things...

1181
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,600
Okay, I don't have enough content to make it its own stream chat.

1182
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,340
So we had to... we had to do it here.

1183
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:52,820
Okay?

1184
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,840
We had... Sandland needed...

1185
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,460
Sandland had like four other streams.

1186
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,060
It's okay with sharing its...

1187
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:03,380
It's okay with sharing a bit of its stream time with...

1188
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,680
Oh, I got approval!

1189
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,700
Okay, guys.

1190
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,820
Okay, I'll show you guys.

1191
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,640
It's so funny.

1192
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,600
So they're making like...

1193
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,320
So, Morikawa plushies.

1194
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,160
And...

1195
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,180
And they were sending me...

1196
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,720
Because like, I asked them for like advice on plushie manufacturing.

1197
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,840
And this was like...

1198
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,420
This was the first prototype that they received.

1199
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,700
So this one's from Poki.

1200
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,780
Poki Pokums.

1201
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,920
And it...

1202
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,660
Oh my god, it's so fucking funny.

1203
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:37,520
Yeah!

1204
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,760
Yeah!

1205
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,340
Every time!

1206
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,060
This is the...

1207
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:47,580
This is the...

1208
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:47,700
I'm sorry.

1209
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,400
This is the very first...

1210
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,600
Um...

1211
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:50,940
Um...

1212
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,400
Prototype.

1213
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,080
That was like...

1214
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,580
Sent to her.

1215
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,540
And I was like, why is it...

1216
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,860
Why does it have like a fucking trash bag?

1217
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,200
Because they're trying to get the pattern...

1218
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:04,920
The...

1219
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,980
A pattern down.

1220
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,160
So...

1221
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,140
So like...

1222
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:08,720
She was like...

1223
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,240
So this is like the illustration.

1224
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,040
This was the illustration.

1225
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,420
And this was...

1226
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,040
Um...

1227
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,140
This was the...

1228
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,520
First prototype.

1229
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,580
This is what I mean!

1230
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,600
It's very hard to prototype plushies!

1231
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:25,960
So...

1232
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,600
So this was like...

1233
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,300
The very...

1234
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,040
The illustration they sent.

1235
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,500
And then they received that.

1236
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,100
So then, you know...

1237
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,600
My friend was like...

1238
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,480
Um... No.

1239
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,660
So they had to do like edits and stuff.

1240
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,660
So like, you know...

1241
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,100
They had to do edits and be like...

1242
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,220
Yeah, can we like... you know...

1243
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,460
Fix all of that.

1244
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,580
And then...

1245
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,700
Fix the...

1246
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:51,860
Um...

1247
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,080
The drafting of everything.

1248
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,900
So they're just waiting on the second...

1249
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,780
I don't think I was sent the second prototype.

1250
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,420
Because they were, you know...

1251
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,260
Yeah, now it looks like clothing.

1252
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,880
But it went from...

1253
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,100
Potato sack to...

1254
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:06,620
Yeah.

1255
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,120
I'm sorry.

1256
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,420
It's so funny.

1257
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,320
It's so...

1258
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,440
It's so...

1259
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,800
The potato sack is so funny.

1260
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,900
It's actually...

1261
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,500
Oh my god, it's so good.

1262
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,640
I love looking at it.

1263
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,520
Anyway...

1264
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,360
My friend...

1265
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,200
Gigi, she is a big Xenoblade fan.

1266
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,080
So this was their...

1267
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,640
It's not as like big as a transition as it was.

1268
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,060
The Kali one.

1269
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,580
Because like...

1270
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,400
So this was like the first prototype.

1271
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,180
And then...

1272
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,120
This is what it looks like afterwards.

1273
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,900
Which was a huge improvement.

1274
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:49,580
I am...

1275
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:51,440
But...

1276
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,120
This was the second...

1277
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,780
The final.

1278
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,580
So the transition between these two...

1279
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,760
Worked...

1280
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,820
Like more seamlessly...

1281
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,860
Than...

1282
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,620
You know...

1283
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,760
Than the Kali one.

1284
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:13,040
To be fair, the left one is naked too.

1285
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,820
So it looks scarier.

1286
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,740
Because it's like...

1287
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,020
When things are naked, you are just like...

1288
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:18,840
Why is it naked?

1289
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:19,280
You know?

1290
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:19,820
Like...

1291
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,420
Oh...

1292
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,440
Yeah...

1293
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,180
So...

1294
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,040
So yeah...

1295
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,860
I mean the left one is naked.

1296
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:34,800
But then...

1297
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,660
So now the right one has clothes.

1298
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,300
So it looks less threatening.

1299
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,540
Uh...

1300
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,000
What the...

1301
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,440
So...

1302
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,140
It's less...

1303
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,560
Yeah, the right one looks more friendly now.

1304
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,720
The left one is like...

1305
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,300
Yeah, I'm naked.

1306
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,300
What are you gonna do about it?

1307
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,020
Uh...

1308
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,140
Uh...

1309
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,760
Yeah, so...

1310
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,320
So that's...

1311
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,500
That's what I mean when I meant like...

1312
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:04,700
My...

1313
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,140
When I say like plushy prototyping is...

1314
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,400
Very difficult work.

1315
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,320
Um...

1316
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,560
Because... you know...

1317
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,860
From the first prototype to the end...

1318
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,280
And majority of the pre-production...

1319
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,820
Majority of like...

1320
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,260
Oh sorry, you're right.

1321
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:21,980
We need like...

1322
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,200
Naked bars on it.

1323
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:23,800
Give me a sec.

1324
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,880
Alright, is this making you guys uncomfortable?

1325
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,320
Give me a sec.

1326
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,380
I know a way...

1327
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:28,980
To solve this.

1328
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,240
Alright, let's see.

1329
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,120
Uh...

1330
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,020
Let me...

1331
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,340
Let me see if I can do this.

1332
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,120
Alright, uh...

1333
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,280
And then opacity is...

1334
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:40,840
Oh wait, no.

1335
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,600
It is...

1336
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:42,920
Background opacity.

1337
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,120
There we go.

1338
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,080
So we can cover their identity.

1339
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,720
Alright, so like I said...

1340
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,660
The one on the left is a...

1341
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,120
Criminal.

1342
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,320
So much better.

1343
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,400
Is that better guys?

1344
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,920
Will we ever get a tomato plushy?

1345
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,280
Yes!

1346
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,540
In the future one day.

1347
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,740
One day you'll get a tomato plushy.

1348
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:13,940
Um...

1349
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,560
Steven, thank you for the super chat.

1350
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,500
Thank you, thank you.

1351
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,560
Uh...

1352
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,680
Thank you for the super chat.

1353
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,640
Thank you, thank you.

1354
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,640
Uh... When are you doing the Sandland...

1355
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,220
Donation... Donatathon?

1356
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,480
Where you play Sandland for two months straight?

1357
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,000
We're already at like one month of Sandland.

1358
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,940
I did not expect Sandland to go this...

1359
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,420
Uh... To go this far.

1360
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,880
Uh... So...

1361
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,160
I mean we're nearing two months to be fair.

1362
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,580
We're nearing two months...

1363
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,560
For... For Sandland.

1364
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,860
But thank you for the super chat.

1365
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,780
Thank you.

1366
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,800
One more month to go guys.

1367
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,940
One more month.

1368
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,120
Yes!

1369
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,940
Check out GG and Poki.

1370
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,680
I love them.

1371
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,160
They're really great friends.

1372
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:58,120
And they were the ones that suggested the...

1373
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,060
The plushy manufacturer to me.

1374
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:00,900
So...

1375
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,280
When I get the prototype...

1376
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,440
Prototype one...

1377
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,260
Don't worry guys.

1378
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,180
I'll...

1379
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:07,820
I'll make sure to show you guys...

1380
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,200
What it could have been.

1381
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,060
You know...

1382
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,640
I'll make sure to show you guys...

1383
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,400
What the plushy could have...

1384
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,700
What you could have got...

1385
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,700
If we had a shorter production.

1386
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,500
Um...

1387
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,040
But yes.

1388
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,080
Anyway what else?

1389
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:28,580
Oh yes!

1390
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:29,840
Croaky!

1391
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,360
Uh... Croaky.

1392
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:32,960
Alright.

1393
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,720
Let me grab...

1394
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,800
Let me grab the croaky stuff.

1395
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:37,740
Real quick.

1396
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,180
Uh...

1397
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,940
I didn't prep any of this.

1398
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:43,600
To be fair.

1399
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,060
I just went straight into it.

1400
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:45,200
Alright.

1401
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,800
Let me grab the stuff real quick.

1402
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:47,500
Oh my god.

1403
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,340
There's so many messages.

1404
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,140
Guys.

1405
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:49,500
Okay.

1406
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,120
I did not realize I have...

1407
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:55,680
Alright.

1408
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,600
I need to reply to some emails after this stream.

1409
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,360
I did not see this.

1410
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,780
I did not see this.

1411
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,860
I did not see this.

1412
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,480
Um...

1413
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:09,800
Um...

1414
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,920
Alright.

1415
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,340
I'm going to reply to this.

1416
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,180
And...

1417
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:13,520
No.

1418
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,380
It's not my business email.

1419
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:20,200
It's my other email that I use to contact people for commissions and stuff.

1420
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,360
So I separate those two.

1421
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,080
I separate like my...

1422
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,300
Because I'm contacting people for commissions myself.

1423
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,720
Personally.

1424
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,140
So I separate my business email with that.

1425
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,720
I didn't realize...

1426
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,260
When I woke up.

1427
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,640
I didn't realize that...

1428
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,040
Um...

1429
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,900
Um...

1430
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,000
That I had emails.

1431
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,640
I replied in a day.

1432
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,880
I feel like CROQI...

1433
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,040
CROQI was sort of really...

1434
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,860
Easy in terms of like...

1435
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,040
To get finalized.

1436
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,440
I did ask for like variations on stuff.

1437
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,740
Because I really want to see what it looks like.

1438
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,540
So...

1439
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,740
CROQI could have like...

1440
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,540
I wanted to see if CROQI...

1441
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,040
Was just...

1442
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,780
Was just like one full flat color.

1443
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,640
So like there was no like...

1444
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,600
Extra...

1445
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,120
Uh... things to it.

1446
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,740
Let me see if I can... I think it's this one.

1447
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,020
No that's the naked guy.

1448
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:14,700
Here we go.

1449
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,380
So CROQI could have looked like this.

1450
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,440
Where it was just...

1451
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,100
Uh...

1452
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,800
The wings was...

1453
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,140
It's not it's own color.

1454
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:27,260
But I felt like it blended in too much with the rest of the body.

1455
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,560
So I was like...

1456
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:29,940
No.

1457
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,460
No.

1458
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,360
So let me see.

1459
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,440
And then...

1460
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,220
Yeah and then after that I was like...

1461
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,940
No I want CROQI to...

1462
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,940
To have you know...

1463
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,880
To have like...

1464
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,940
You know the wings being like...

1465
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,980
I think like CROQI originally also...

1466
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,440
The body was...

1467
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,200
Darker as well and I didn't like that too.

1468
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,320
So...

1469
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,820
We changed so that...

1470
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,040
And so we changed it to having the wings darker.

1471
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,600
And...

1472
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,360
Oh my gosh where is the first CROQI?

1473
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,000
Where the fuck did the first CROQI go?

1474
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,860
Oh yeah wait.

1475
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,700
Okay there it is.

1476
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,640
So yeah CROQI could have looked like...

1477
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,620
Where is the other one?

1478
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,020
Uh...

1479
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,700
No that is not...

1480
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,440
CROQI could have looked like extra dark.

1481
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,700
And I was like oh yeah no.

1482
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,600
Cause the...

1483
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,240
The color balancing...

1484
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,720
Like you could barely see...

1485
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,200
My expression and everything.

1486
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,720
So like I was like oh my gosh...

1487
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,480
It's a little bit...

1488
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,720
It's like CROQI is...

1489
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,700
It was too night mode.

1490
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,420
The...

1491
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,620
The hat just did not translate...

1492
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,420
Very well.

1493
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,860
With the darker version...

1494
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:48,700
Of CROQI.

1495
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,380
This is like what is it called?

1496
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,800
Like the evil-er?

1497
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,300
Evil-er CROQI.

1498
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,560
So yeah CROQI...

1499
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,420
CROQI also went through...

1500
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,380
A lot...

1501
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,880
Not a lot but a few minor changes.

1502
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,860
In emo CROQI.

1503
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,480
You know it's like shadow CROQI.

1504
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,540
Oh my god CROQI is Sonic.

1505
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,460
And this is shadow CROQI.

1506
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:14,760
Hahahaha.

1507
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:16,980
Hahahaha.

1508
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:19,200
Um...

1509
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:20,840
Yeah the worst...

1510
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,020
Worst timeline CROQI.

1511
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,220
Um...

1512
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:28,240
I didn't like the color changes of the beak as well.

1513
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,720
I felt like the beak being the same color as the body.

1514
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,200
Felt like...

1515
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:32,880
Uh...

1516
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,500
It represented the best...

1517
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,900
Out of all of them.

1518
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,240
But yes there is...

1519
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,980
This is shadow CROQI.

1520
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,500
If we give shadow CROQI a gun it would be perfect.

1521
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,000
Uh... CROQI...

1522
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,180
CROQI the crow.

1523
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,680
Shadow CROQI and CROQI.

1524
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,900
We just need to give shadow CROQI a gun.

1525
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,820
And then everything will be perfect.

1526
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,320
Ah not so Deadpool.

1527
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,240
Thank you for the super chat.

1528
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:56,560
Thank you.

1529
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,040
Thank you.

1530
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:58,860
CROQI.

1531
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,020
Hahahaha.

1532
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,140
Um...

1533
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,260
But yes that was basically the CROQI process.

1534
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,040
Now!

1535
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,200
New skin suit.

1536
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,180
New skin suit.

1537
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:09,560
Alright.

1538
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,720
I said I'll give like...

1539
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,840
I'm honestly... I talked about it in the community post.

1540
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,400
But yes I'm scared.

1541
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,860
I'm nervous.

1542
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:17,840
I'm scared.

1543
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,100
I've been like...

1544
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:22,340
I've been like anxious about the...

1545
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,200
The new skin suit.

1546
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,100
For like a couple of months now.

1547
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,760
It is a gamble.

1548
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,380
It is a big gamble.

1549
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,900
Because like you guys know.

1550
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,340
My current skin suit.

1551
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,880
It is four years old.

1552
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,100
Like um...

1553
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,640
It can now walk and talk.

1554
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:37,260
I mean...

1555
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:37,740
Yeah.

1556
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,440
Hahahaha.

1557
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,000
It can... you know.

1558
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,060
It can go to kindergarten now.

1559
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:49,760
And like this is the skin suit that everybody like...

1560
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,060
Knows me by like now.

1561
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,440
And like it's...

1562
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,040
You know everybody sees this and they're like...

1563
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:56,960
That's DOKI!

1564
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,220
Yeah.

1565
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,620
That's me.

1566
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,920
But I... like it's still like...

1567
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,700
A past of me.

1568
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,600
As well.

1569
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,200
And if I had a choice...

1570
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,120
Um...

1571
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,760
To like you know...

1572
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,280
Come back with a newer skin suit.

1573
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,260
I would have done it.

1574
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,560
But I couldn't.

1575
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,500
Because one day...

1576
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,480
One day is not enough.

1577
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,540
When it comes to prepping a...

1578
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,020
New skin suit.

1579
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,820
So that's why...

1580
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,640
I was... I'm really scared.

1581
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,560
Hahaha.

1582
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:36,920
Because like I said a lot of you guys are very used to what I look like now.

1583
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:38,340
And...

1584
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,140
Um...

1585
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,320
But I felt like I...

1586
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,120
Changed a lot.

1587
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:45,580
As a person.

1588
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,020
As a tomato.

1589
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,400
I changed a lot and grew a lot as a content creator.

1590
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,360
And...

1591
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,060
I felt like I really wanted to...

1592
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:54,860
Um...

1593
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,500
Have something that...

1594
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,900
Basically merges all my experience together.

1595
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,320
And also...

1596
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,000
Feels more like...

1597
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,320
Me.

1598
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:05,500
And...

1599
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,340
The thing is...

1600
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,240
Being a thief is all about stealth.

1601
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,440
Well...

1602
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,300
Hahaha.

1603
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,740
I think we know by now that I'm not a very stealthy person.

1604
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:18,520
Hahaha.

1605
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,840
So I could be the worst thief imaginable.

1606
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:21,540
Hahaha.

1607
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:23,660
I've been...

1608
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,300
Technically the worst thief imaginable when it comes to stealth.

1609
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,780
Mendy thank you for the super chat.

1610
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,100
Thank you.

1611
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:29,620
Thank you.

1612
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,100
Doki with a revolver and in the old west.

1613
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,420
And has her birthday on July 4th.

1614
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,860
And still trying to fight the being American allegations.

1615
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,000
Thank you for the super chat Mendy.

1616
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:39,540
Thank you.

1617
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,020
Thank you.

1618
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,380
I bet you guys didn't even know Shroud's Canadian.

1619
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,120
Hahaha.

1620
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,040
Hahaha.

1621
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,160
You guys just assume...

1622
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:49,820
Everybody's American.

1623
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:53,140
I bet you guys didn't even know Shroud's fucking Canadian.

1624
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:53,840
Hahaha.

1625
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:55,460
Hahaha.

1626
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:57,820
Hahaha.

1627
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,580
He could have been the most American person there.

1628
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:01,700
But you guys didn't know.

1629
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:02,940
He's actually Canadian.

1630
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:06,740
Oh my god.

1631
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,360
Did you know the actor who plays Homelander...

1632
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,760
I saw the actor who plays Homelander.

1633
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,080
I knew he had like an accent.

1634
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,800
But I always thought he was British.

1635
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,680
But then I found out the actor of Homelander was...

1636
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,160
Is actually New Zealand.

1637
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,920
I was like oh my god.

1638
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,240
Well I know Tenz is Canadian.

1639
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,880
I knew that.

1640
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,800
Because like...

1641
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,460
I used to watch Tenz...

1642
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,300
A long time ago.

1643
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,000
So I knew that he was Canadian.

1644
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:31,560
He's Canadian.

1645
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,520
I actually found out...

1646
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:35,560
Shroud's Canadian.

1647
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,520
From like...

1648
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:41,140
My short that talked about Shroud.

1649
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,180
And somebody commented...

1650
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:44,660
Oh he's also Canadian.

1651
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,700
I was like what the fuck.

1652
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,240
He's 30 and he's Canadian.

1653
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,700
Oh my god.

1654
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,240
But yeah.

1655
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,160
Anthony Starr the guy who plays...

1656
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,220
Homelander in the Boys.

1657
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,140
He's actually from New Zealand.

1658
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,340
He's a fucking Kiwi.

1659
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,540
I didn't know that.

1660
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,520
I thought he was British.

1661
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,700
I thought he was like...

1662
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:05,240
A lot of people who play American characters...

1663
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,520
Usually they come from...

1664
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,340
I mean to be fair.

1665
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,360
Usually they come from like...

1666
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,020
The UK.

1667
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,380
When they try to do like American stuff.

1668
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,940
Like you know the guy who plays House.

1669
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,000
God what's his name.

1670
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,800
They have really good American accents though.

1671
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,200
They have really good American accents.

1672
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:24,120
It's actually crazy how good their American accents are.

1673
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,260
Cass thank you for the super chat.

1674
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:27,640
Thank you.

1675
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,180
Thank you.

1676
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,180
Don't worry Doki.

1677
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,780
Our evolution going to bird mode didn't hurt too much either.

1678
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:32,640
You'll be fine.

1679
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,900
Thank you for the super chat.

1680
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,260
Thank you.

1681
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:34,860
Thank you.

1682
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,200
Fox thank you for the super chat.

1683
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:36,520
Thank you.

1684
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,860
Just by the silhouette it really brings back memories.

1685
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,280
I know it's gonna be so you.

1686
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,480
Try not to worry Doki.

1687
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:42,900
Thank you.

1688
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,760
Thank you for the super chat.

1689
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,580
Fox thank you.

1690
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,100
Thank you.

1691
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,940
Nethy thank you for the super chat.

1692
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:47,660
Thank you.

1693
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,660
Honestly I don't mind the first facial expression.

1694
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,460
Because it looks as if you're judging us.

1695
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,240
Also sad life.

1696
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,260
Guys we're gonna get to sad life soon.

1697
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:59,740
I know I said that like 30 minutes ago.

1698
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,440
But we're almost there.

1699
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,280
Okay.

1700
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,180
We're almost to the sad life.

1701
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:05,820
Alright.

1702
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,860
Thank you for the super chat.

1703
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:08,400
Thank you.

1704
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:09,100
Thank you.

1705
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,060
It's okay Doki.

1706
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,840
Asula is also a cowboy cosplayer.

1707
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,020
And he's not American either.

1708
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1709
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:15,820
Thank you.

1710
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,440
Thank you.

1711
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,780
No matter if it's a new skinsuit.

1712
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,160
We will still adore you Doki.

1713
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:21,840
Of who you are.

1714
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:22,820
Thank you for the super chat.

1715
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,280
Thank you.

1716
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:23,700
Thank you.

1717
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,720
I really appreciate it.

1718
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,200
We're not even in Sandland anymore.

1719
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,820
We're in fucking forest land.

1720
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,380
We're not even near Sand.

1721
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:35,540
Anyway.

1722
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,400
As I was saying.

1723
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,580
Regarding the new skinsuit.

1724
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:42,520
Like I said.

1725
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:43,260
I am wearing.

1726
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:45,060
Obviously it is a big change.

1727
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,280
Some of you guys were giving examples.

1728
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,520
But they do that too.

1729
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:51,020
But they still kept main characteristics.

1730
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:52,800
Of like.

1731
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:53,940
I guess like.

1732
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,080
They kept main.

1733
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,900
Key main characteristics.

1734
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,180
From each suit.

1735
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,580
To make them.

1736
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,600
So that the transition is easier.

1737
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,440
The new skinsuit.

1738
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:07,660
There might be a big change.

1739
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,360
When it comes to certain parts.

1740
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,320
It's also like I said.

1741
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,140
It is a new skinsuit.

1742
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:14,880
Creator.

1743
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,220
So um.

1744
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,340
Clea is not the.

1745
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:22,040
Clea has had input as well.

1746
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:22,600
Regarding.

1747
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,040
Design concepts.

1748
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,180
And stuff.

1749
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,780
So like she had input.

1750
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,740
Regarding it too.

1751
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,040
She helped with some of the parts.

1752
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,540
Trying to figure out what I wanted.

1753
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,720
For her and my new creator.

1754
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,340
Both worked together.

1755
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,860
When it came to figuring out.

1756
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:42,600
The new skinsuit.

1757
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,880
We went through a lot of concepts.

1758
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,360
We went through a lot of drafts.

1759
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,700
To like pinpoint exactly.

1760
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,080
Like okay.

1761
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:50,320
I'm satisfied with this.

1762
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,320
But I am worried.

1763
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,340
I am scared.

1764
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,260
Because like I said.

1765
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,540
It is a big change.

1766
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,880
And uh.

1767
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,000
It is a big change.

1768
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,080
And like it definitely will not.

1769
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:03,920
Look like this.

1770
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,480
When it comes to like.

1771
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,060
The style and everything.

1772
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,020
It's a new brand.

1773
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,840
And obviously.

1774
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,500
It is a gamble.

1775
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:13,900
It is a big gamble.

1776
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,540
Because changing brands.

1777
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,600
Doesn't work all the time.

1778
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:19,640
Hahahaha.

1779
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:22,180
Hahahaha.

1780
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,420
So.

1781
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:26,860
So.

1782
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,480
So.

1783
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:30,600
I'm scared.

1784
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:31,740
Hahahaha.

1785
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,760
Change is very scary.

1786
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,860
We all are scared.

1787
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,600
Of change.

1788
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,440
So I really do hope.

1789
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,020
You do end up growing to like it.

1790
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,380
If you are like weirded out.

1791
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,800
By the new look.

1792
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,180
That you will still grow to like it.

1793
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,660
Because no matter what.

1794
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,060
In the inside.

1795
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,800
It's still a tomato.

1796
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:53,700
So like.

1797
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,940
It just has a new skinsuit.

1798
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,920
A different profession.

1799
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,220
Hahahaha.

1800
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:00,920
Hahahaha.

1801
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:01,900
So.

1802
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:05,060
That's all I hope for.

1803
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:05,980
Hahahaha.

1804
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,380
So yeah.

1805
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,520
That's really all I really want to say.

1806
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,720
About the new skinsuit.

1807
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:14,780
Um.

1808
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,520
I worked really hard with.

1809
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,600
Preparing for it.

1810
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,020
The team that's preparing.

1811
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,060
The stuff for.

1812
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,580
For.

1813
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,220
For.

1814
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,400
Saturday.

1815
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,660
So like.

1816
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,240
Um.

1817
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,520
I hope you guys will enjoy.

1818
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,060
What I'm cooking on Saturday.

1819
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,080
Hahahaha.

1820
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,080
You know when I say like.

1821
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:42,200
Um.

1822
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:45,060
This project is going to be my biggest one yet.

1823
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,480
I think.

1824
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,420
This project.

1825
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,280
Well.

1826
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,280
I won't say like down or like the Vichat worlds did take a lot of fucking work.

1827
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:53,820
Uh.

1828
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,480
When it came to like the team itself.

1829
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,720
And um.

1830
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,780
The team handling itself.

1831
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,460
And me looking in.

1832
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,520
But I feel like since this.

1833
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,800
This is the most people I've ever hired.

1834
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,620
When it came to working on a project.

1835
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,240
I think that's the best thing I can say.

1836
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:13,140
Regarding on what Saturday is going to be.

1837
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,360
Saturday might be like.

1838
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,220
The most people I've ever fucking hired.

1839
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:19,460
To work on it.

1840
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:20,440
Hahahaha.

1841
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:24,600
Hahahaha.

1842
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:24,700
Hahahaha.

1843
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,340
So.

1844
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:27,940
So.

1845
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,220
I hope you guys will enjoy Saturday.

1846
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,840
I really do.

1847
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:33,760
Also.

1848
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,560
Um.

1849
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,180
Because of that.

1850
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,680
Because of how close my new skin suit reveal.

1851
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,680
Is.

1852
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,860
When it comes to my birthday.

1853
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:46,160
We're gonna.

1854
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:49,440
You're gonna realize that Saturday.

1855
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,100
Might as well be sort of like.

1856
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,840
Similar to what a birthday project might be.

1857
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,640
And because it was so close to each other.

1858
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,660
The birthday might not be.

1859
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,220
As cool.

1860
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:03,260
Hahaha.

1861
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:03,880
On Saturday.

1862
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,660
We might.

1863
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,060
I'm gonna let you guys know.

1864
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:08,720
I'm treating.

1865
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,120
I'm treating Saturday as.

1866
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,100
My birthday project.

1867
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,000
So.

1868
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:15,820
Hahahaha.

1869
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:19,820
Hahahaha.

1870
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:21,940
So.

1871
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,220
So like.

1872
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,200
Because of that.

1873
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,800
My birthday will basically.

1874
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,960
Pretty lackluster.

1875
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,080
When it comes to.

1876
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,100
The Saturday.

1877
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,980
Because I couldn't do two big projects in a row.

1878
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:36,320
Hahahaha.

1879
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:38,740
Hahahaha.

1880
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:39,940
Um.

1881
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,020
Yeah.

1882
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,720
Skin day over birthday.

1883
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:44,580
Hahaha.

1884
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,140
So I hope that's okay.

1885
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,680
Because I know like people were like.

1886
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,380
Oh she's gonna plan so much on this day.

1887
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,180
Oh my god.

1888
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,640
And then her birthday's gonna be like.

1889
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:56,080
Two weeks.

1890
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:56,680
Oh my god.

1891
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,420
Oh my god.

1892
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,820
That means her birthday is gonna be.

1893
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,800
Also amazing.

1894
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,820
I just want to please lower your expectations on the birthday.

1895
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:04,460
Hahaha.

1896
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,160
Because I spent all my effort.

1897
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,700
Daring people for.

1898
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,360
For skin suit day.

1899
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,220
Hahaha.

1900
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:14,840
Next scene.

1901
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,780
Thank you for the super chat.

1902
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:16,200
Thank you.

1903
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:16,680
Thank you.

1904
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,920
As long as it feels like you're on the inside.

1905
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:18,920
That's what's more important.

1906
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,520
You'll still be a little tomato no matter what.

1907
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,640
As long as I am still your little tomato.

1908
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,500
That's all I care about.

1909
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,860
That's all I want.

1910
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,220
Alright.

1911
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,080
Finally.

1912
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,200
After an hour and fifteen minutes.

1913
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,180
It's Sandland time.

1914
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:32,680
Okay wait.

1915
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,000
JK.

1916
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:33,740
JK.

1917
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,120
Because I need to boot up Sandland.

1918
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:35,940
Give me a.

1919
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:36,760
Hahaha.

1920
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,040
Guys give me a sec.

1921
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,120
Just gotta boot.

1922
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:42,800
Oh wait.

1923
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,540
Gotta plug in my controller too.

1924
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:45,760
Give me a sec.

1925
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,840
I plug in my controller.

1926
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:49,940
Alright.

1927
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:50,600
Alright.

1928
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,260
And then.

1929
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:52,920
Oh no.

1930
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,820
My cables are tangled up.

1931
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,140
So I gotta untangle my cables.

1932
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,180
Give me a sec guys.

1933
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,780
I'm untangling my cables.

1934
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:00,620
And then.

1935
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,700
And then it's Sandland time.

1936
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,800
Then it's gameplay time.

1937
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,980
The 10% of you guys here.

1938
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:07,900
That's for Sandland.

1939
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:08,980
Hahaha.

1940
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,480
That's it.

1941
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,040
Oh my.

1942
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:11,580
Hahaha.

1943
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,500
Holy shit.

1944
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,340
Okay.

1945
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,880
I think my favorite part of all this.

1946
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:18,960
Is the moment I was like.

1947
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:19,240
Yeah.

1948
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,880
It's Sandland time.

1949
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:22,120
I like.

1950
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,960
Fifty people left instantly.

1951
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:24,780
Hahaha.

1952
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:26,380
Okay.

1953
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,200
That's it.

1954
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,220
Not gonna lie.

1955
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,220
That's really funny.

1956
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,220
Like not gonna lie.

1957
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:32,500
That's.

1958
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:34,440
That was pretty funny.

1959
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:35,720
I'm.

1960
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,940
That they're weak.

1961
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,660
Don't keep their fucking wings.

1962
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,000
Scattered.

1963
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,820
Let's go guys.

1964
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,880
The people that actually cared about Sandland.

1965
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,980
Let's fucking go.

1966
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,060
Okay.

1967
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:49,520
Give me a sec.

1968
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:49,940
I need a.

1969
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,240
They don't understand.

1970
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,040
Exactly.

1971
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,960
They don't understand.

1972
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,340
Peak gameplay.

1973
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,340
Now some people are like.

1974
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,560
Well I wasn't even gonna stay for Sandland.

1975
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,280
But now that you called me out.

1976
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,380
I'm gonna stay here.

1977
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,340
Out of spite.

1978
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,020
To prove you wrong.

1979
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:10,980
Um.

1980
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:12,540
Um.

1981
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,720
Thank you for the super chat.

1982
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,100
Thank you.

1983
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:14,640
Thank you.

1984
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,100
They hate trees.

1985
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,680
And they hate sand too.

1986
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,100
Alright.

1987
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,000
Let's see.

1988
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,400
They aren't properly addicted to the Tokium.

1989
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,120
Thank you for the super chat Coyote.

1990
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:26,740
Thank you.

1991
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:27,360
Thank you.

1992
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:28,740
Alright.

1993
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:29,640
Let's see.

1994
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,240
Where's my solo.

1995
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,260
Alright.

1996
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:34,300
Then we gotta swap.

1997
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,640
To uh.

1998
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,300
Where's Sandland.

1999
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:38,200
There you go.

2000
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:40,640
Sandland.

2001
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:40,780
Yay.

2002
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:41,640
Alright.

2003
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:43,120
We're in forest land now.

2004
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,960
For those of you.

2005
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,300
Who are watching Sandland for the first time.

2006
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,640
We're in forest land.

2007
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:50,340
Yes it was click bait.

2008
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,100
We're actually in the forest right now.

2009
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,580
Your comrades are living it up.

2010
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,240
You're not joining them Ann?

2011
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,400
Ann and.

2012
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,080
Welcome to tomato farm.

2013
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:01,480
Welcome.

2014
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:01,920
Welcome.

2015
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,180
Not so Deadpool.

2016
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,200
Thank you for the super chat.

2017
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:04,560
Thank you.

2018
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,040
Thank you.

2019
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,440
Sandland filters out the weak dragoons from the insane.

2020
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:09,340
What?

2021
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,120
Thank you for the super chat.

2022
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:12,540
Thank you.

2023
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,200
Thank you.

2024
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:13,880
Wait.

2025
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:16,980
Do we not have normal dragoons?

2026
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,260
Yeah.

2027
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,280
Do you intend to keep that from them forever?

2028
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,560
No.

2029
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,600
I'll tell them.

2030
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,100
Oh she's not gonna tell them she's half demon.

2031
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,400
Why not get it over with now?

2032
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:33,460
Sometimes you gotta wait for the right time prince.

2033
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,020
Sometimes you gotta wait for the right time prince.

2034
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:35,960
Tell them you're half demon.

2035
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,160
The more it'll eat away at you.

2036
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:40,660
If you're going to tell them.

2037
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,220
Better sooner than later.

2038
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,340
Maybe you have a point.

2039
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:45,840
They might as well know now.

2040
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,080
They might be racist against demons.

2041
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,240
But like.

2042
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,920
But you're half a demon.

2043
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:54,500
And you're like one of the three women in the camp.

2044
01:16:58,900 --> 01:16:59,380
Alright.

2045
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,440
It'll be a bit awkward though.

2046
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,660
They end up burning her for a witch.

2047
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,420
Everyone listen up.

2048
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,220
Half demon no wonder she is so hot.

2049
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,460
I'm calling you out D-Dragon.

2050
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,260
Burn her!

2051
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,780
She's a witch!

2052
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,900
Or she's half a demon!

2053
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:22,680
Burn her!

2054
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,600
Huh?

2055
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,280
Is this some kind of joke?

2056
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,600
I'm being serious.

2057
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:48,900
I had no idea either until recently.

2058
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,340
Wouldn't their mom look different?

2059
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:52,820
Like.

2060
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,140
Like.

2061
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:57,720
Wouldn't the mom look like a fucking demon?

2062
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,120
There's no demon there that looks human.

2063
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,260
There's no demon there that looks human.

2064
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:02,720
Long ago.

2065
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:03,740
Cause they'll be like.

2066
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,900
Why are your ears pointy?

2067
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,260
Jp thank you for the super chat.

2068
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:13,620
Thank you.

2069
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,500
The weak shall fear the sad.

2070
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:16,160
It's true.

2071
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:20,790
Can't believe it.

2072
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:27,910
Queen Lilith was a fiend all along?

2073
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:30,470
Heatherlyn thank you for the super chat.

2074
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,770
Thank you.

2075
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:32,670
Your very first super chat too.

2076
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:33,470
I knew.

2077
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:36,230
We have real Sandland Dragoons here.

2078
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:37,410
I knew it.

2079
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:39,410
I thought Fred was the one who was lying to us.

2080
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:42,930
Turns out the only liar was you.

2081
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:44,770
Oh no.

2082
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:47,470
Long ago.

2083
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:49,830
But like a fiend protected them.

2084
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:51,590
A fiend saved their lives.

2085
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,710
This is a serious matter.

2086
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:58,330
It could threaten the very existence of the resistance.

2087
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,270
It could threaten the very existence of the resistance.

2088
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,570
It could threaten the very existence of the resistance.

2089
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:01,990
I apologize.

2090
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:05,730
Wouldn't a fiend teaming up with them.

2091
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:08,210
Already threaten the resistance.

2092
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,590
It wasn't my place to share a secret.

2093
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:12,310
King Jam and Queen Lilith wanted kept so badly.

2094
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:13,450
It wasn't my place to share a secret.

2095
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:16,910
Like we already teamed up with literally the prince of the demons.

2096
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,750
Oh, she's a succubus.

2097
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:48,390
Whoa!

2098
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:50,590
Damn, that must be wild.

2099
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:54,770
That must have been wild for King Jam.

2100
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,770
Jam is a real one!

2101
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:11,530
Finally,

2102
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:18,450
the forest satin line.

2103
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:19,830
Nerdy, thank you for the super chat.

2104
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:20,870
Thank you, thank you.

2105
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:35,890
Man,

2106
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,010
that's some straight up prejudice there.

2107
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,460
Maybe we should revisit this tomorrow morning.

2108
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,500
We have another similar conversation?

2109
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,340
What does this change?

2110
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,280
She's just half fiend.

2111
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,350
Like that changes nothing.

2112
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:14,630
Anne, I'm so sorry for causing you such distress.

2113
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:16,870
Oh, I'll survive.

2114
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:18,930
It was just a bit of a shock.

2115
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:22,630
Now I've kind of warmed up to the idea of being part fiend.

2116
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:25,770
Finding out I've got an uncle was a plus too.

2117
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,330
Okay, but like... okay.

2118
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:27,870
Okay, but like...

2119
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:27,870
okay.

2120
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:28,530
I'm just so confused.

2121
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:31,850
Is that... like she could always talk to animals or bugs.

2122
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:34,130
Like, did she not tell anybody that?

2123
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:39,110
And be like, hey, that bug just said hi to us.

2124
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:40,830
Like, did everyone just thought she was crazy?

2125
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:48,030
Aren't you bothered by your allies turning...

2126
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:50,050
There's like one thing I don't really...

2127
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:53,130
Like, there's always like such big potholes when it comes to like...

2128
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:55,050
Anime in general.

2129
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:56,830
Oh, it comes from any story, not just anime.

2130
01:21:56,830 --> 01:22:00,550
One of the biggest potholes that I've been like thinking about a lot...

2131
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:01,850
Was the fact that like...

2132
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:04,210
For those who ever watched Dr. Stone...

2133
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,170
So like, you know how they started off in the village?

2134
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:09,350
That village is full of inbreeding from six people.

2135
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:13,190
It started off with six people and that village grew to 50 villagers.

2136
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:15,230
I kept thinking about it.

2137
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:18,390
I was like, did they inbred to this?

2138
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:19,230
Like...

2139
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,890
Because the village started with six!

2140
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,710
And then it grew to 50 people!

2141
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:34,090
And I've been thinking about it the past week, guys.

2142
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:35,830
I've been thinking about...

2143
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:37,510
I literally was thinking about it the past week.

2144
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:39,510
And like, I was like googling it.

2145
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:39,910
Because I...

2146
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:42,790
Yeah, let's sleep.

2147
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,770
I was just like, how did this happen?

2148
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:45,750
And I was like googling it.

2149
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:47,290
I was like, is it inbreeding?

2150
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:50,590
And everybody on Google was just like, yeah, most likely.

2151
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,930
And I'm like, why did they not explain this?

2152
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:04,220
I was just like, why didn't they explain this?

2153
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,480
I didn't know!

2154
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,680
I didn't know it was like, they actually came from six people!

2155
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:17,940
Yay!

2156
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,700
They don't though!

2157
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:35,560
Their only health issue is...

2158
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,220
What was it?

2159
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:36,800
Pneumonia?

2160
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,860
They have like pneumonia and fucking...

2161
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:43,820
Some little child who needs glasses.

2162
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:47,200
That's the only defects they have.

2163
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,360
We'll vote, we keep on resisting too.

2164
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,860
There's no one.

2165
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,440
Oh shit!

2166
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,820
This guy is extra racist.

2167
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,540
Oh nevermind.

2168
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:17,960
Nevermind.

2169
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:19,100
He's not.

2170
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:20,420
I'll be the bigger man.

2171
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,640
How about you, Bien?

2172
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,000
False alarm.

2173
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:25,660
He's not.

2174
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,680
What are you talking about?

2175
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,420
So they're not racist!

2176
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,460
They're just sheep!

2177
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,600
They believe whatever the fuck they wanna believe.

2178
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,280
They believe whatever the fuck the main person believes.

2179
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:41,340
They're all sheep!

2180
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,880
They don't think for themselves.

2181
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:46,140
Before then, they were super racist against demons.

2182
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,380
But now that they're okay- now that this guy's okay with it, they're like, you know what?

2183
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:52,460
I just like being in a group.

2184
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:59,260
I- They're like, I just like being in a group right now.

2185
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:00,000
I don't wanna leave.

2186
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,960
I wanna be included.

2187
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,520
They don't have ideals!

2188
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,700
They just follow whatever the main person believes in.

2189
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,240
The Aquanium!

2190
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:26,180
The Aquarium!

2191
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:26,180
Wow!

2192
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,040
You actually know where it all is?

2193
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,280
Now we have the tracker!

2194
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:42,380
This story would've been more interesting if there was one guy that left and joined the enemy team.

2195
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,040
...transported at high speed.

2196
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,760
There's still one left that Brad hasn't gotten his hands on yet.

2197
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,900
Alright, which one is it?

2198
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,060
It's a battleship.

2199
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,520
A sunken ship, known for giving even famous junkers trouble.

2200
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:04,680
But then if we had that happen, this game would be like 50 hours long instead of 30.

2201
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,180
That's no reason not to go.

2202
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,160
Indeed.

2203
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:14,680
We leave as soon as everyone's ready.

2204
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,700
Well, we're traveling light.

2205
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,800
So we might as well go on ahead.

2206
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,080
Yay!

2207
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,680
Oh, we finished the quest.

2208
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,220
Yay!

2209
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,120
We never finish it.

2210
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:30,880
Oh my god!

2211
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,760
She's finally in my party!

2212
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,580
It only took like 4 parts!

2213
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,560
Holy shit, you're finally useful!

2214
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,900
Just because we replaced you?

2215
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,280
Oh my god!

2216
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,120
You finally matter in my game!

2217
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,180
She's real!

2218
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,820
Oh my god, this took fucking forever!

2219
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,340
Holy shit!

2220
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,060
It took us fucking forever to make her matter in this game!

2221
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,560
Oh shit, okay.

2222
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,800
Can I actually jump off?

2223
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:08,860
No, okay, thank god.

2224
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,220
Oh my god, she's relevant again.

2225
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:14,000
She could have helped me like 80 years ago, but that's okay.

2226
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,580
Alright, ancient gold coin.

2227
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,420
Ugh, I don't need treasure maps.

2228
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,040
...any rare items you find.

2229
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:21,680
Alright.

2230
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,880
I'll make it worth your while.

2231
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:28,260
Not sure if it's true, but I remember hearing that some groups of people evolved the genetic traits that reduced the effects of inbreeding.

2232
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,680
Clock, thank you for the super chat!

2233
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:30,280
Thank you, thank you!

2234
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,860
There were six people!

2235
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:38,120
It doesn't matter if it reduces the traits of inbreeding!

2236
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:42,000
It was six people that started the village!

2237
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,680
And that's assuming they made two kids per couple!

2238
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,920
...

2239
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:49,140
...

2240
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:52,060
...

2241
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:52,180
...

2242
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:52,860
...

2243
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:54,080
Alright.

2244
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,280
Let's see.

2245
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,800
Can I bring out...

2246
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,480
Okay, I can't call the ride yet.

2247
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,720
That's why I was so confused!

2248
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,820
Like, I didn't think about it!

2249
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:17,140
And then I was reading up Doctor Stone lore, and then they were talking about how there's only one village in the entirety of Japan, and for that lore.

2250
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,120
So I was just like, ok

2251
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:52,420
So I got so... I don't know.

2252
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,560
I don't know.

2253
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:29,920
One of the biggest issues with Dr. Stone is that Dr. Stone is all about science and scientific discovery.

2254
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:36,700
But if it's about science, then why the fuck do we have an inbreeding problem?

2255
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:46,580
Why is there... why are they not solving the issue?

2256
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:49,660
It's about science!

2257
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,840
The entire...

2258
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,840
Oh, goodbye.

2259
01:29:54,780 --> 01:30:00,380
The entire present... premise is science.

2260
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:08,220
So like what... Oh my god, I keep going.

2261
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:10,820
It's not... It is!

2262
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:18,860
How can there be a village of 50 people and the biggest issue they have is that somebody needs glasses?

2263
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,140
Like they don't have any like...

2264
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:22,660
Like...

2265
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,600
They don't have like, you know, like the Egyptian problem.

2266
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,360
With the Egyptian royalty and how, you know, what was it?

2267
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,340
King Tut has so many health issues.

2268
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:35,060
And that wasn't even 3,000 years!

2269
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:39,340
That was like, at best, 600... 500 years!

2270
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:42,120
King Tut had a fucked up back.

2271
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:43,320
Um...

2272
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,880
Like, elongated head or some shit.

2273
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,560
And like, uh...

2274
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,380
And like, bad jaw.

2275
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,060
And she had so many health issues.

2276
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,620
But like, the best...

2277
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:57,580
The worst that happened to that fucking...

2278
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:01,360
The village of 50 was that one girl needed fucking glasses.

2279
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:03,220
It doesn't make sense!

2280
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,080
Hahahaha!

2281
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:06,660
Hahahaha!

2282
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:11,240
Like, if it was any other...

2283
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:15,300
Any other manga or like anime, I'm like...

2284
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:16,060
That's fine.

2285
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,680
Like, have that plot hole.

2286
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,880
But it's literally about science!

2287
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,320
And the science...

2288
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,700
It's literally about science!

2289
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,540
So, that's like the biggest scientific issue I have!

2290
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:37,960
And at least the Pharaoh's Inferno wasn't as bad as like a fucking...

2291
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,320
Village of Six?

2292
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,200
Anyway, that's all I really want to talk about.

2293
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:44,560
Like, that's...

2294
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,900
This is my issues with, uh...

2295
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,860
This is my issues with like...

2296
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:50,960
Anime plot holes.

2297
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:51,700
Anime plot holes.

2298
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:53,380
Not just anime plot holes, but like...

2299
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,060
Anime plot holes.

2300
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:55,020
Like, plot holes in general.

2301
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,240
It was worse.

2302
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,280
It was worse.

2303
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:05,120
The science is simply not being affected by genetic inbreeding.

2304
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,480
Uh...

2305
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,780
You're thinking too much.

2306
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:10,280
No!

2307
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,460
Because Dr. Stone is all about thinking too much!

2308
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:14,780
Because it's about science!

2309
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:18,020
They literally went so in deep about engineering...

2310
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:19,840
They literally went so in deep about engineering...

2311
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,140
And like, uh...

2312
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,680
Chemistry and all that shit.

2313
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:24,880
But not...

2314
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,640
On how to make glass.

2315
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,640
And how to make medicine.

2316
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,740
And like, um...

2317
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:35,500
How shit... like naval... naval...

2318
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,040
Ships work.

2319
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,620
But what about...

2320
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,620
GENETICS!

2321
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,780
It's more about noticing patterns.

2322
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,980
Adjusting intentions.

2323
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:45,680
That's all.

2324
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,420
Okay, I'm done.

2325
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,480
I'm done now.

2326
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,140
Well, goodbye.

2327
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:53,620
I'm not okay.

2328
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,240
Oh, whoops!

2329
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:00,480
Guys, it didn't work, guys.

2330
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:02,900
No, you have to go all the way back!

2331
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:03,540
Oh, I didn't.

2332
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,180
Oh, thank God.

2333
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,320
Never punished!

2334
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,520
I love not being punished!

2335
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:10,280
Okay.

2336
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:11,680
Alright.

2337
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,260
How do I get on this?

2338
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:13,480
Yes.

2339
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:14,460
Uh...

2340
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,740
Ruz, thank you for the super chat!

2341
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,400
Thank you, thank you!

2342
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:22,200
As someone who took two courses on evolution genetics, the inbreeding issue is primarily misunderstood by a...

2343
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,940
Name it as an absolute.

2344
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:27,820
Sick people can produce a population of offspring conditionally.

2345
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,160
Thank you for the super chat!

2346
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,260
Thank you, thank you!

2347
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,260
Alright, explain.

2348
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:37,660
You can't just say it and just be like, trust me.

2349
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,980
I took two courses.

2350
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,740
Two courses.

2351
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,400
Two courses.

2352
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,300
I don't think explains enough.

2353
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:49,760
Source me.

2354
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,240
Wait, it's the Omega Raptor.

2355
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,340
It's not as good as the Alpha Raptor.

2356
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:59,360
Write a thesis now and argue for it.

2357
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:01,920
Okay.

2358
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:09,160
Also, like, I don't think two courses can explain why the fuck six people can make sure inbreeding is not an issue.

2359
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,860
Citation is needed.

2360
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:15,840
Who is your pre-review source right now?

2361
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:21,900
Get your professor on the line and explain to me the science of Dr. Stone inbreeding.

2362
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,020
That's all I want.

2363
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:27,680
Nice!

2364
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,660
One down!

2365
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,200
I have 100 words with references now.

2366
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:35,520
Make sure, make sure it has like citations.

2367
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:36,860
I want MLA format.

2368
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,980
Thank you for the super chat.

2369
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:39,360
Thank you.

2370
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:39,780
Thank you.

2371
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:40,320
Explain.

2372
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,480
Sounds like a lot of science.

2373
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:44,320
I think we need an inbreeding art for Dr. Stone.

2374
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:45,820
The thing is, Dr. Stone is a science.

2375
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:46,000
What kind of an inbreeding art is this?

2376
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,300
Dr. Stone is a science!

2377
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:47,520
They ended Dr. Stone.

2378
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:54,000
They ended it, and I felt like I didn't get my answers.

2379
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:55,320
Here we go.

2380
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:01,360
Make sure not to go in so deep that you can't touch the bottom prints.

2381
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:02,180
Wait, what?

2382
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:03,200
Uh-huh.

2383
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:03,540
Thanks.

2384
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,060
What?

2385
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:04,640
What?

2386
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:08,020
What does that even mean?

2387
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,860
What does that mean, thief?

2388
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,320
Dr. Stone.

2389
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:14,720
Dr. Stone.

2390
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:15,800
Dr. Stone.

2391
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,040
They did have a prequel!

2392
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:17,940
That's the thing!

2393
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:21,020
They made a prequel about the astronaut thing!

2394
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,460
But it didn't answer anything!

2395
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,280
It just implied that the village started off with six!

2396
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:31,740
Alright,

2397
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:36,480
this way we go.

2398
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:39,320
Alright.

2399
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:42,940
How far is this place that we have to go?

2400
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,300
I mean, to be fair, it is a big map.

2401
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:46,640
Pretty far, huh?

2402
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:47,620
It is a...

2403
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,440
We need somebody to do a case study right now.

2404
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,600
You know how like YouTubers would like recreate...

2405
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:56,840
Okay, okay.

2406
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,940
I stopped talking.

2407
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,100
We don't need that.

2408
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,820
We don't need that.

2409
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,920
Okay, but you know how like...

2410
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,480
Okay, you know how YouTubers...

2411
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,380
Oh my god, there's cows!

2412
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,920
I knew they were an invasive species too!

2413
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:18,300
There's no way cows would survive!

2414
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,800
There's no way cows could survive in the sand!

2415
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,440
I knew it!

2416
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:24,700
I knew they came from here!

2417
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:29,160
Okay, so you know how like YouTubers will like recreate certain things in anime?

2418
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:32,400
Like the Attack on Titan gear and stuff like that?

2419
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:36,880
And they'll be like, oh this happened in the anime.

2420
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,260
Can it actually happen in IRL?

2421
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,520
So this is Forestlands capital.

2422
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,460
It's impressively vast.

2423
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,460
You bet this place will keep us entertained for a while.

2424
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,540
Yeah, the city does have a lot to offer.

2425
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,840
This is a nice city.

2426
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:56,640
Oh, it's the capital!

2427
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:58,840
Wait, oh my god!

2428
01:36:58,900 --> 01:36:59,480
It's him!

2429
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:01,360
It's his twin brother!

2430
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:04,620
I think they ran out of models.

2431
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,500
Wait, it's him too!

2432
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:08,340
It's not a matter of whether you can or not.

2433
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,800
Wait, are they all the same people?

2434
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:10,940
Wait, what the fuck?

2435
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,600
Are they part of my crew or are they actually the same people?

2436
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:16,900
There's no way!

2437
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:19,040
Did I just found the twin?

2438
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:24,020
Oh my god, what if they actually had another version of these guys?

2439
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:26,460
Oh my god, it's him again!

2440
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:28,840
Hello!

2441
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,840
This is also him!

2442
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:34,920
Alright.

2443
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:39,760
Let's see.

2444
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,540
Where do we have to...

2445
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,640
Oh, where do I have to go?

2446
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:45,760
Wait, did I went the wrong way?

2447
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:46,880
I'm not sure.

2448
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,300
Oh.

2449
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,700
Oh, I was not supposed to...

2450
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:50,580
Oh, and... whoops!

2451
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:52,900
I was not supposed to go there.

2452
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:54,240
Oh my god, it's so far.

2453
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:54,920
I'm just gonna...

2454
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:57,640
I'm gonna fast travel to the entrance.

2455
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:58,640
Uh...

2456
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,440
It's way too far.

2457
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:06,020
I'm gonna fast travel to the entrance to get out of there.

2458
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:08,300
I don't wanna walk!

2459
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,180
I'm too lazy.

2460
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,620
It's all the way over there?

2461
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:14,140
Oh my god, it's so far!

2462
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:17,600
It's so fucking far!

2463
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:19,840
Alright, here we go.

2464
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,200
I think it's just cause like...

2465
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:25,760
Wait, what?

2466
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:27,260
Where...

2467
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:28,600
Where is this?

2468
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:32,420
Where the fuck is that?

2469
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,480
Wait, how do I get there?

2470
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,460
Oh my god, I am so lost.

2471
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:39,940
I'm so lost.

2472
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:40,820
Oh, there's a road!

2473
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,700
I fucked up with the road!

2474
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:45,660
Hey, if we fall, we'll just deal with it!

2475
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:45,960
Oh, there's a road!

2476
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,060
Okay.

2477
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,660
Are you crazy?

2478
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:49,720
Here we go.

2479
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:50,840
Oh yeah, no.

2480
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:54,160
Okay, spoiler alert for those who are actually keeping up today.

2481
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:54,860
Okay.

2482
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,640
Alright, guys.

2483
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:57,600
Okay.

2484
01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:58,700
Okay.

2485
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:02,000
Uh, for those who actually wanna keep up today with Dr. Stone.

2486
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:04,680
Look, I didn't really read the manga.

2487
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:10,140
I only watched a bit of bits of the anime and I'm like, I read the whole lore and story of Dr. Stone.

2488
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,560
I just didn't read the manga itself.

2489
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,480
But I read everything about it.

2490
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,880
About the chapters and the arc.

2491
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:21,520
So like, for those who are keeping up with Dr. Stone and don't wanna get me spoiled.

2492
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:28,360
Mew for like 30 seconds and I'll give you the reason why people turn into stone.

2493
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:28,920
Okay.

2494
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:30,040
Mew yourself now.

2495
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:30,820
Alright.

2496
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:33,580
The reason why people turn into stone is because aliens.

2497
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:34,640
There you go.

2498
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:36,240
Alright, now I...

2499
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:42,520
After all of that, it was because of aliens.

2500
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:52,980
I'm just like, after all of that, it was that all along.

2501
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:54,820
Just...

2502
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,440
It's always...

2503
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,980
IT'S ALWAYS ALIENS!

2504
01:39:58,420 --> 01:39:58,900
I...

2505
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:04,680
I feel like...

2506
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:07,620
I feel like whenever they're like, what do we do?

2507
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:08,940
And then they're like, aliens.

2508
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,520
That's like their answer to everything.

2509
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,640
Okay, how do we know to unmute?

2510
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:15,820
Okay, tell them to...

2511
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:17,840
Tell them that they can unmute now.

2512
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,400
Now they can unmute.

2513
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:25,740
Also, uh...

2514
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:26,940
Sumi, thank you for the super chat.

2515
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:27,920
Thank you, thank you.

2516
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,500
I just had to talk about that.

2517
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,320
Like...

2518
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:39,580
Like, I understand if it's like, you know, you're like, ooh, you're supposed to have your brain up...

2519
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:40,240
Holy shit!

2520
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:42,240
How far is this place?

2521
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,340
How far is it?

2522
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:48,520
How far is it?

2523
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,680
And the army uses them too.

2524
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,760
So like...

2525
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,780
Um...

2526
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,860
I realize a lot of like...

2527
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:57,900
Anime and manga that I thought was like, really smart back then...

2528
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:58,480
If...

2529
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,260
But like...

2530
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:00,720
But when you like, reread it...

2531
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:01,940
Okay, I love Death Note.

2532
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:02,860
Don't get me wrong.

2533
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:03,600
Wait, what's this?

2534
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,260
Oh, there's snakes!

2535
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,520
They were snakes.

2536
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:11,040
Alright, I'll let you guys...

2537
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,100
I'll let the children live.

2538
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,880
I'll let you guys live.

2539
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,800
So you guys can be stronger than me.

2540
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:16,300
And then your mother.

2541
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,380
And then I want you to do a revenge arc.

2542
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,380
And show me how strong you become.

2543
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:21,700
Anyway...

2544
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:23,720
So like, I love Death Note.

2545
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:24,580
Don't get me wrong.

2546
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,160
Death Note's a great anime and manga.

2547
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,440
And I love the series a lot.

2548
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:30,240
I love the author.

2549
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:32,420
But like...

2550
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:33,600
When you reread it...

2551
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:34,300
You're like...

2552
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:35,480
Wait, this is actually...

2553
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,420
For like, the fucking smartest...

2554
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:40,240
For someone who thinks he's like, so fucking smart...

2555
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:43,680
I think it was all the premise about being like, oh my god, he's so...

2556
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:44,620
I am...

2557
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:45,580
I am light.

2558
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,700
I am the smartest man in Japan.

2559
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,180
But he's like a fucking high schooler.

2560
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:55,280
He's like...

2561
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,540
He's like a goddamn high schooler.

2562
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,520
And he's like...

2563
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:02,180
I am the smartest person in Japan.

2564
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,780
And he's rubber.

2565
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,220
He's 17.

2566
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:15,180
He's like...

2567
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:16,760
I'm going to be a god!

2568
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:20,920
And he's a fucking 17 year old child!

2569
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:29,700
I was obsessed with Light.

2570
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:32,100
I remember back then, I was like, oh my god, Light is so smart.

2571
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:35,060
And now I'm like, oh my god, this fucking child.

2572
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:42,200
Oh, it's him!

2573
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:47,540
Why are you here?

2574
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:49,440
Do I even need to ask?

2575
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:54,020
Oh yeah, bro wanted to be normal, so he pulled out an 18 plus magazine.

2576
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:54,920
Oh yeah!

2577
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:56,860
Yeah, doubt it.

2578
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,600
Oh, come on.

2579
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:03,340
Did we really have to do this?

2580
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:07,560
I'm not in the mood to throw fists with you chumps.

2581
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:09,980
Good.

2582
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,240
Then take your men and leave.

2583
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,280
See, that won't work either.

2584
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:17,620
I got a job to do.

2585
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:22,200
You just can't make some people happy.

2586
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:22,920
Yeah.

2587
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,800
Yeah, fight us!

2588
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:25,940
Fight us!

2589
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:27,880
No tanks!

2590
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:29,920
Final destination!

2591
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:31,380
No tanks!

2592
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,880
How about whoever reaches the engine room first gets the aquarium?

2593
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:36,600
Well, I have a bike.

2594
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:37,980
So, you want to race?

2595
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:39,120
Oh no, no way.

2596
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:40,500
I'm really bad with races.

2597
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:42,040
I suppose I'm better than you.

2598
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:42,320
What?

2599
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:46,140
I suppose this is the best we could hope for.

2600
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:47,500
Unless it's Garfield Kart.

2601
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,900
I'm really good at Garfield Kart.

2602
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,040
Wait, by foot?

2603
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:58,520
But I have a bike!

2604
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,180
Wait for the signal.

2605
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:02,840
On your marks, get set, go.

2606
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:03,920
Wait, but if he says it...

2607
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,860
But if he says it, that's cheating.

2608
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:07,160
On your marks.

2609
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,380
He's gonna go before...

2610
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:11,700
Before go.

2611
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:13,580
What the fuck?

2612
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:15,080
Huh?

2613
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:16,380
It's dark.

2614
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:18,140
There's no sun in here.

2615
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,100
Awww, he's cheating.

2616
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:23,920
Put your goggles down.

2617
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,420
It's a cool factory.

2618
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:39,010
Oh my god, cheater.

2619
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:40,950
Bring out the bike, it's too late.

2620
01:44:41,170 --> 01:44:42,370
He already cheated.

2621
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:44,850
He already cheated.

2622
01:44:45,970 --> 01:44:47,050
Get the bike.

2623
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:53,730
He already cheated and it's good if I can get the bike now!

2624
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:57,410
Okay.

2625
01:44:58,430 --> 01:44:59,890
It doesn't matter!

2626
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:05,550
He cheated first, it's bike time!

2627
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:09,830
Wait, how is he so fast?!

2628
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:11,990
He was on foot the entire time!

2629
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:13,190
That's not fair!

2630
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:16,250
How is he so fast?!

2631
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:18,190
It's not.

2632
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:21,130
Guys, I think he did more than just use flashbang, guys!

2633
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:23,490
I think he cheated even more!

2634
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:26,750
Who would have thought the bad guy cheating even more!

2635
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:29,010
Alright, we don't need crocodiles here.

2636
01:45:29,730 --> 01:45:31,070
They're invasive species.

2637
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,230
They came from flatland.

2638
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:36,550
He cheated already.

2639
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:40,930
What?!

2640
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:50,650
Bro, he flashbanged me and you want him to join us?!

2641
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:53,810
What's wrong with you, Adan?!

2642
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:56,490
Not everybody's a good guy!

2643
01:45:58,230 --> 01:45:58,670
Alright.

2644
01:45:58,870 --> 01:46:02,410
I know he's hot, but like... come on, Elvis is dead.

2645
01:46:03,610 --> 01:46:05,890
Wait, how do we... how do we get this?

2646
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:10,370
Wait, do I... wait, how do I move this?

2647
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:12,350
Can I pick it up?

2648
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:13,710
Oh, I can back grab it!

2649
01:46:13,810 --> 01:46:13,970
Yeah!

2650
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:16,110
Okay.

2651
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:16,790
Alright.

2652
01:46:16,930 --> 01:46:17,410
Grab!

2653
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:22,510
Alright.

2654
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:25,550
Alright, and then what?

2655
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:26,610
And now push it?

2656
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:28,290
Push!

2657
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:31,190
No!

2658
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:32,970
Which way do I push?!

2659
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:36,030
Firmly grasp it!

2660
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:39,090
Now move.

2661
01:46:46,710 --> 01:46:47,530
But yeah.

2662
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:49,750
Yeah, like... oh yeah, this is why!

2663
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:51,730
And then I also had an issue with Riz, thank you the Super Chat.

2664
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:52,470
Thank you, thank you.

2665
01:46:52,570 --> 01:46:58,830
Light being smart went out the window when he self-doxed himself by murking someone on a talk show only broadcasted in Japan.

2666
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:00,490
Oh god I'm good.

2667
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:02,270
Yeah, cause like, when you...

2668
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:11,890
When you first read the manga, you're thinking like, Light is so smart, but the older you get, you realize he was a stupid fucking child.

2669
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:14,130
Like, with a huge ass ego.

2670
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:15,350
And then...

2671
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:17,050
And now I'm like, oh my god.

2672
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:21,350
Oh my god, I've encountered these people before in content creation.

2673
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:25,190
People who are too young with too much power.

2674
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:30,150
It makes sense.

2675
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:34,910
I was like, holy shit, everything makes sense now.

2676
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:38,250
Yeah, it's the point, I know.

2677
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:39,330
It's like, oh my god.

2678
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:40,410
That's the whole point.

2679
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:42,190
But when you're younger, you're like...

2680
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:44,950
When you're younger, you look up to light.

2681
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:47,230
You're like, oh my god, he's so smart and cool.

2682
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:51,610
When I was younger, reading that, I was like, oh my god, light is so smart and cool.

2683
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:55,350
But as I got older, I was like, oh my god, he is a stupid ass child.

2684
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:58,650
Someone please, he has so many issues.

2685
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:04,510
Somebody slap this guy.

2686
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:10,090
He needs to be slapped right now.

2687
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:14,930
Yes, I unironically got it.

2688
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:15,050
I did.

2689
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:16,990
I thought he was so cool.

2690
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:23,650
I unironically like light as a character.

2691
01:48:25,690 --> 01:48:27,950
I mean, I thought L was interesting too.

2692
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:29,270
I thought he was interesting.

2693
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:32,310
But I thought they were both really cool characters.

2694
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:35,550
L is also a huge... Okay, confession.

2695
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:38,870
Yeah, you know.

2696
01:48:40,930 --> 01:48:41,730
Confession time.

2697
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:55,210
Confession time.

2698
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:56,330
Confession time.

2699
01:48:59,110 --> 01:48:59,770
Confession time.

2700
01:48:59,770 --> 01:48:59,890
Confession time.

2701
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:00,350
Confession time.

2702
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:00,610
Confession time.

2703
01:49:00,610 --> 01:49:00,990
Confession time.

2704
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:01,470
Confession time.

2705
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:02,210
Confession time.

2706
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:02,650
Confession time.

2707
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:03,190
Confession time.

2708
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:03,710
Confession time.

2709
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:04,110
Confession time.

2710
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:04,690
Confession time.

2711
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:05,830
Confession time.

2712
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:06,170
Confession time.

2713
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:08,310
Confession time.

2714
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:10,470
Confession time.

2715
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:11,850
Confession time.

2716
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:15,410
Okay, we need to... oh, you gotta hold it?

2717
01:49:15,650 --> 01:49:16,150
Okay.

2718
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:18,150
No, no, I don't need to go on.

2719
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:21,150
People who... people already get the context.

2720
01:49:21,690 --> 01:49:25,190
Yeah, I... yeah.

2721
01:49:26,490 --> 01:49:28,250
I used to... yeah.

2722
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:30,810
Yeah.

2723
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:33,770
I was not 18, by the way.

2724
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:42,270
Just so you guys know.

2725
01:49:50,970 --> 01:49:53,570
I was definitely underage.

2726
01:49:57,410 --> 01:50:01,090
I just need... I want to be transparent with all of you.

2727
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:01,830
Okay.

2728
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:03,430
Okay.

2729
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:03,750
Okay.

2730
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:06,750
Whoa!

2731
01:50:08,610 --> 01:50:10,170
No backseeks, Toki.

2732
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:12,130
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

2733
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:12,990
Thank you.

2734
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:13,830
Oh, yeah.

2735
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:14,550
No, I...

2736
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:17,630
Yeah, I... I figured, you know.

2737
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:21,790
Since he was older and he was clearly smarter...

2738
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:24,430
Yeah, he was... he was... you know.

2739
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:25,810
He took the top bunk bed.

2740
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:34,070
No name, thank you for the super chat.

2741
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:34,650
Thank you.

2742
01:50:34,650 --> 01:50:35,210
Thank you.

2743
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:35,310
Thank you.

2744
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:37,550
Alright.

2745
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:38,950
There you go.

2746
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:41,070
Alright.

2747
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:41,730
Yeah!

2748
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:43,010
Wait, where do I have to go?

2749
01:50:44,290 --> 01:50:44,970
Oh, this way.

2750
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:45,390
Okay.

2751
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:46,990
Oh, I need to find the box.

2752
01:50:48,830 --> 01:50:49,910
Where's the other box?

2753
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:52,370
Where the fuck is the box?

2754
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:53,350
Is that the box?

2755
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:55,670
Where's the box?

2756
01:50:56,570 --> 01:50:58,330
How am I supposed to... oh, there it is.

2757
01:50:58,470 --> 01:50:59,070
Oh my god.

2758
01:50:59,090 --> 01:51:03,610
It's like there's so many boxes, but where is like... where is the real box?

2759
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:04,830
Oh, there it is.

2760
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:04,830
Oh, there it is.

2761
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:04,830
Oh, my god.

2762
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:04,850
It's like there's so many boxes, but where is like...

2763
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:04,850
where is the real box?

2764
01:51:06,210 --> 01:51:09,610
Oh, and I also was a huge Nier fan.

2765
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:11,470
I loved Nier so much.

2766
01:51:11,850 --> 01:51:17,450
I used to really enjoy the character Nier.

2767
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:19,910
I heard the anime ruined him.

2768
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:20,550
Okay, guys.

2769
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:24,990
I only watched the first season of the Death Note anime.

2770
01:51:25,230 --> 01:51:30,210
I didn't watch the second season because everybody kept saying the second season was really not good.

2771
01:51:30,210 --> 01:51:41,830
So I watched clips of it, but I never watched the second season because everybody said they ruined N.

2772
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:42,810
Sorry.

2773
01:51:42,950 --> 01:51:44,270
N as in Nier.

2774
01:51:44,410 --> 01:51:44,790
Yeah.

2775
01:51:46,450 --> 01:51:51,310
Yeah, everybody said that the second season butchered N and I actually liked the character.

2776
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:59,630
Sorry, I called him by his real name.

2777
01:52:04,270 --> 01:52:08,850
Yeah, I actually really enjoyed that character in the manga.

2778
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:15,990
But I heard the second season of the anime really butchered him.

2779
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:17,110
So I was just like...

2780
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:18,690
I docked... Oh no!

2781
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:19,490
What did I do?

2782
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,110
Write him in the Death Note?

2783
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:22,810
Oh no!

2784
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:29,850
No!

2785
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:30,130
But yeah.

2786
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:32,710
I thought he was a cool kid.

2787
01:52:33,070 --> 01:52:35,030
I thought he was just misunderstood.

2788
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:37,570
Okay, he was anti-social as fuck.

2789
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:42,630
I mean, you would be too if you lived your entire life in the fucking basement.

2790
01:52:42,650 --> 01:52:47,130
In L's basement and like all you had was the orphanage.

2791
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:50,330
Uh...

2792
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:51,950
To be fair, L was...

2793
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:52,930
What the fuck is this?

2794
01:52:53,070 --> 01:52:54,790
It's just all red crates.

2795
01:52:55,130 --> 01:52:56,490
Where is the loot?

2796
01:52:57,970 --> 01:52:59,050
Where is the loot?

2797
01:53:01,170 --> 01:53:02,730
Where the fuck is my loot?

2798
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:06,090
Wait a minute.

2799
01:53:06,210 --> 01:53:09,710
Where is my loot in this... in this world?

2800
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:11,490
Where is it?

2801
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:15,050
Hello?

2802
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:15,610
Loot?

2803
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:17,770
Loot?

2804
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:20,850
What the fuck?

2805
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:21,830
Is this a maze?

2806
01:53:22,830 --> 01:53:25,050
They gave me a maze in a dungeon?

2807
01:53:25,050 --> 01:53:25,850
This is bullshit.

2808
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:29,750
I can't believe it.

2809
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:32,810
I can't believe it.

2810
01:53:34,770 --> 01:53:37,290
I can't believe they put me through a maze.

2811
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:39,250
Where is the yellow paint?

2812
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:39,910
Exactly!

2813
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:43,750
This loot better be fucking worth it, guys.

2814
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:47,970
This loot better be goddamn worth it.

2815
01:53:49,110 --> 01:53:49,550
Okay.

2816
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:51,010
Woop.

2817
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:52,910
Woop.

2818
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:54,730
Woop.

2819
01:53:55,610 --> 01:53:56,050
Okay.

2820
01:53:56,370 --> 01:53:57,070
Where is it?

2821
01:53:57,150 --> 01:53:57,690
Alright, there you are.

2822
01:53:59,710 --> 01:54:00,770
Get over here.

2823
01:54:01,510 --> 01:54:03,730
Guys, I think I might be a little under level.

2824
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:06,750
Just... just a little bit.

2825
01:54:07,230 --> 01:54:07,890
I think.

2826
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:08,310
Okay.

2827
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:08,890
Nice.

2828
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:11,690
Okay, that like might be like overdoing it too.

2829
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:13,370
Just a little bit though.

2830
01:54:13,450 --> 01:54:13,730
I don't know.

2831
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:17,090
Only a teensy weensy under level.

2832
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:21,170
There's more?

2833
01:54:22,150 --> 01:54:23,110
Oh, okay.

2834
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:26,270
This better be the sickest loot ever.

2835
01:54:27,970 --> 01:54:29,510
Okay, how do I jump again?

2836
01:54:30,510 --> 01:54:31,050
Uh...

2837
01:54:32,610 --> 01:54:33,470
How do I...

2838
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:34,310
Okay.

2839
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:37,010
How do I do the...

2840
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:37,730
Oh, X!

2841
01:54:37,950 --> 01:54:38,570
Thank you.

2842
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:39,290
Thank you, game.

2843
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:41,370
Oh, there was loot right here!

2844
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:42,710
No!

2845
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:44,550
Bring me back up!

2846
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:46,290
Bring me back up!

2847
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:49,130
Okay.

2848
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,790
Nice.

2849
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:50,390
Oh my god.

2850
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:50,930
Thank god.

2851
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:53,290
Thank god there was loot right here.

2852
01:54:54,570 --> 01:54:56,910
Okay, this better be some sick ass loot, guys.

2853
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:59,010
I feel like I've been here for a while.

2854
01:55:00,510 --> 01:55:01,530
Alright, let's see.

2855
01:55:01,790 --> 01:55:02,450
Oh, there's more.

2856
01:55:03,590 --> 01:55:04,810
Machine gun scrap?

2857
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:06,850
I need a machine...

2858
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:07,010
Whoa!

2859
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:08,730
What are you doing here?

2860
01:55:09,650 --> 01:55:10,310
Get out!

2861
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:11,110
Okay.

2862
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:12,230
Tank time.

2863
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:12,690
Okay.

2864
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:14,670
I definitely need to upgrade my tank.

2865
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:17,650
My tank definitely needs it.

2866
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:21,850
I feel like if I did more of the side quests, maybe...

2867
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:24,910
Maybe my tank would not be as...

2868
01:55:24,910 --> 01:55:29,170
Would not be as scrappy as it is now.

2869
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:30,510
Nah.

2870
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:32,390
Nah, that can't be it, right?

2871
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:34,550
Nah.

2872
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:37,390
Wait, where am I?

2873
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:39,090
Where am I now?

2874
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:43,670
Where am I?

2875
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:45,970
Do I go here?

2876
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:49,490
Like, actually, where am I?

2877
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:53,950
I'm so confused.

2878
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:55,970
Like, where have I gone?

2879
01:55:58,410 --> 01:55:59,310
Did I...

2880
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:00,930
Am I going...

2881
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:01,690
Oh, wait.

2882
01:56:01,810 --> 01:56:03,590
Is this where I'm supposed to be going?

2883
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:08,430
What?

2884
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:09,070
Okay.

2885
01:56:09,070 --> 01:56:10,090
Oh, wait.

2886
01:56:10,210 --> 01:56:11,550
I end up going the right...

2887
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:13,710
Oh, it like looped back.

2888
01:56:14,050 --> 01:56:14,490
Oh.

2889
01:56:16,390 --> 01:56:17,830
It looped back.

2890
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:20,090
Wait, that's crazy.

2891
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:21,870
Thank God.

2892
01:56:22,030 --> 01:56:22,470
I was like...

2893
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:25,850
I was going to be like so lost because I didn't know where to actually go.

2894
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:27,410
Okay.

2895
01:56:28,570 --> 01:56:30,550
Okay, we're going to beat up some bombs real fast.

2896
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:31,770
There we go.

2897
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:32,070
Whoa.

2898
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:34,150
Okay, this guy is so strong though.

2899
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:36,850
He's so fucking strong, which I appreciate.

2900
01:56:37,370 --> 01:56:37,810
Okay.

2901
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:39,050
Okay.

2902
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:42,690
Okay, we're going to have to...

2903
01:56:42,690 --> 01:56:43,070
No!

2904
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:45,670
I want to open it!

2905
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:46,190
Okay.

2906
01:56:46,330 --> 01:56:47,050
Let's see.

2907
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:48,790
We're going to jump up.

2908
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:50,390
Yay!

2909
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:53,870
And then we're going to jump like a normal person.

2910
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:56,150
I'm going to get off the machine.

2911
01:56:57,710 --> 01:56:58,670
And then...

2912
01:56:59,270 --> 01:56:59,750
No!

2913
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:01,810
I'm too slow!

2914
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:05,030
I don't jump high enough!

2915
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:06,690
Wait, I got this.

2916
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:07,910
Here we go.

2917
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:08,310
Okay.

2918
01:57:10,050 --> 01:57:12,370
What if I cheese this a little?

2919
01:57:12,690 --> 01:57:13,410
Okay, nice.

2920
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:14,410
Alright, we don't need anything.

2921
01:57:16,090 --> 01:57:16,610
Yay!

2922
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:18,190
For cheesing!

2923
01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:21,990
Hey, if it works, it works.

2924
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:24,770
I don't need a jump bot.

2925
01:57:24,990 --> 01:57:26,190
I have legs!

2926
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:29,170
Okay, this way.

2927
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:32,750
This way.

2928
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:34,730
Up I go.

2929
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:37,910
Yeah!

2930
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:44,690
Oh, okay.

2931
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:45,670
That should be a boss fight.

2932
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:48,830
Alright, I'm going to use the bathroom real quick before we go into a boss fight.

2933
01:57:48,910 --> 01:57:49,670
I'll be right back, guys.

2934
01:57:49,690 --> 01:57:50,810
First bathroom break today.

2935
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:23,420
I'm back, guys.

2936
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,920
I just remembered this was supposed to be a race.

2937
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:27,200
Okay, that's...

2938
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:30,760
That's actually a little awkward.

2939
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,080
Technically, we're racing.

2940
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,000
Okay.

2941
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:37,940
All right.

2942
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:39,940
Where are they?

2943
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:41,900
Where are these fuckers?

2944
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:44,900
Oh my God, they're being like pussies!

2945
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,400
Get down from here!

2946
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:47,680
That's right.

2947
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:50,140
That's what you get for not staying down.

2948
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:53,700
Okay, we definitely need to upgrade the puncher, though.

2949
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:56,900
The puncher guy actually does so much damage.

2950
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:00,180
Get them towards...

2951
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:01,620
Slow and steady, everybody.

2952
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:03,200
Slow and steady.

2953
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:04,980
Now just keep going.

2954
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:05,500
Carry this.

2955
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:09,140
Lift, throw.

2956
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:10,060
Oh, there's a throw.

2957
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:12,260
Volume throw mode.

2958
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:14,420
Oh, okay.

2959
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:15,860
It just tells me how to throw.

2960
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:16,940
Okay, lift.

2961
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:18,640
And then, boom!

2962
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:20,620
There we go.

2963
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:21,420
Guys, don't worry.

2964
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:22,300
This power...

2965
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:24,960
Guys, I know this is a battery and like...

2966
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:28,240
I should be gentle with it, but it's okay.

2967
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,280
It's made of titanium.

2968
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:33,720
Like a robot chucking 200 meters at it?

2969
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:35,280
No, it will be fine.

2970
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,100
At 200 miles per second?

2971
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:39,860
Don't worry.

2972
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,040
Everything will be okay.

2973
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,020
Where is the... Oh, it's over here.

2974
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:48,560
Okay, I'll just push it.

2975
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:50,120
It's like, where's the other one?

2976
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:52,700
Alright.

2977
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:59,460
Yeah, it's made of aquarium where apparently you can chuck it now.

2978
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:02,400
Nice.

2979
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:03,360
What a great puzzle.

2980
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:05,040
Wait, water?

2981
02:02:05,380 --> 02:02:06,360
Okay, I'm gonna punch you.

2982
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:07,660
Get over here.

2983
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:09,840
Daddy's not done with you.

2984
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:10,940
There we go.

2985
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:11,280
Nice.

2986
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,380
Happy father... Happy belated father's day.

2987
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:18,600
Alright.

2988
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,160
Nice.

2989
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:20,580
Okay, where's this guy?

2990
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:21,700
Yeah!

2991
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:23,820
Wait, there's more?

2992
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:25,480
What did I say?

2993
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:26,980
What did I say?

2994
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:27,540
Get out.

2995
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:30,620
Get out.

2996
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:32,960
Alright.

2997
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:34,800
I'm gonna get rid of you too.

2998
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:39,420
Robo smash!

2999
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:42,680
Alright.

3000
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:45,440
Is that it?

3001
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:46,980
What else do we have to kill?

3002
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:49,300
What else do we have to... Oh, it's open.

3003
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:50,080
Okay, nice.

3004
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:51,000
That was easy.

3005
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:52,460
Yay!

3006
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,740
Damn, that egg has hands.

3007
02:02:57,420 --> 02:02:59,200
I like how it's like...

3008
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:01,960
Cause like... Oh shit, that's a fucking wall.

3009
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:03,140
Give me a sec.

3010
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:04,320
Give me a sec, little guy!

3011
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:05,180
No!

3012
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:08,440
I'm not tall enough!

3013
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:10,460
Okay.

3014
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:12,060
Let's get rid of him.

3015
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:13,820
And get rid of him.

3016
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:17,000
And then we gotta... I need a loot!

3017
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:19,040
Yoki needs loot!

3018
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:24,340
Oh wait, I need to be a big guy to grab that battery pack.

3019
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:26,180
Okay, nice.

3020
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:28,520
Uh...

3021
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:31,120
Oh, I keep pressing the wrong button.

3022
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:32,760
Alright.

3023
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:34,020
Get over here.

3024
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:36,200
And then...

3025
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:36,420
Oh!

3026
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:40,120
Oh my god.

3027
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:44,520
I think it's so stupid that he chucks the battery that hard.

3028
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:47,220
Cause like, you assume you have to be gentle.

3029
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:47,800
Look at it!

3030
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,340
It has like, electricity warning.

3031
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:52,580
You assume you have to be like...

3032
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:53,800
Super gentle.

3033
02:03:56,460 --> 02:03:58,000
Where's the other battery though?

3034
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:01,580
Where would the other battery go?

3035
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:03,660
Yeah, it's a looting time.

3036
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:06,080
Where's the other one?

3037
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:08,020
Oh, there it is.

3038
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:10,760
God, they're all just boxes.

3039
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:11,580
This should be yellow.

3040
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:14,480
This box should be yellow 100%.

3041
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:15,420
Get over here.

3042
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:15,740
Kobe!

3043
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:17,880
Yeah!

3044
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:21,060
They're built different.

3045
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:24,200
Alright, here we go.

3046
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:27,000
Uh...

3047
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:29,420
Oh, nice.

3048
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:30,660
Yeah!

3049
02:04:30,660 --> 02:04:30,680
Yeah!

3050
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:35,240
No!

3051
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:36,580
I'm too big!

3052
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:38,900
No!

3053
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:41,940
My...

3054
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:44,440
My Iggy needs to lose weight!

3055
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:47,180
You're beautiful, Iggy!

3056
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,320
Don't let them say that about you!

3057
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:50,780
Alright.

3058
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:52,200
Let's see.

3059
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:54,020
This way.

3060
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:55,440
Wait, do I have to...

3061
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:56,880
Oh no, that's just a crocodile.

3062
02:04:58,040 --> 02:04:58,340
Okay.

3063
02:04:58,960 --> 02:04:59,920
Get over here.

3064
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:00,980
I have double misses.

3065
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:03,000
Okay, where do I go?

3066
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:05,540
Oh, this way.

3067
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:06,920
Wait, then why is there...

3068
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:07,840
Why...

3069
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:09,120
Why is there like...

3070
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:09,380
Oh!

3071
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,240
Who's this?

3072
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,360
Okay, I was gonna say...

3073
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:14,440
Like, why did it make me go there?

3074
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:15,860
I'm so confused.

3075
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:18,260
Yay!

3076
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:20,000
Dark energy!

3077
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:22,340
Alright, and then...

3078
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:23,040
Wait, there's a door there!

3079
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,480
Does that mean loot?

3080
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:27,480
When there's a door, does that mean loot?

3081
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:29,040
Okay.

3082
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:31,040
No!

3083
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:32,960
You're also too big!

3084
02:05:36,670 --> 02:05:38,950
That's not gonna stop me from getting my loot!

3085
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:41,550
Wait, my fucking bike died.

3086
02:05:44,070 --> 02:05:44,970
That's awkward.

3087
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:47,250
How the fuck did my bike die?

3088
02:05:48,110 --> 02:05:49,810
How do I get across from there?

3089
02:05:50,090 --> 02:05:51,430
Oh, I need to go from the other side.

3090
02:05:52,990 --> 02:05:54,030
Wait, unless...

3091
02:05:54,810 --> 02:05:56,790
Guys, I know it's a race, guys.

3092
02:05:57,310 --> 02:05:58,530
But like, I...

3093
02:05:59,270 --> 02:05:59,790
I...

3094
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:03,610
Loot is more important, chat.

3095
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:06,470
It is a race, but then like...

3096
02:06:06,470 --> 02:06:07,890
Does a race give me loot?

3097
02:06:08,010 --> 02:06:08,750
I don't think so.

3098
02:06:09,310 --> 02:06:10,690
It just says you win.

3099
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:11,710
That's not loot.

3100
02:06:14,090 --> 02:06:15,230
Okay, we have to go here.

3101
02:06:16,270 --> 02:06:17,670
We go to the other side.

3102
02:06:19,450 --> 02:06:21,030
Loot is always more important.

3103
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:24,110
Yeah, you might win like...

3104
02:06:24,110 --> 02:06:24,890
Uh...

3105
02:06:25,630 --> 02:06:27,250
Yeah, you might get a trophy.

3106
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:29,390
But that's not monetary.

3107
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:29,910
That's not a game.

3108
02:06:30,990 --> 02:06:31,550
Goodbye.

3109
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:34,750
It was worth it.

3110
02:06:37,490 --> 02:06:40,790
Alright, we gotta go this way.

3111
02:06:42,830 --> 02:06:44,150
Oh, it's 2D time.

3112
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:46,170
Is there any enemies in 2D time?

3113
02:06:47,410 --> 02:06:48,590
No, okay, there is.

3114
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:50,770
Don't worry, he'll explode before he gets to me.

3115
02:06:51,850 --> 02:06:52,830
Timed it perfectly.

3116
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:55,450
Alright, up we go.

3117
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:57,310
Goodbye.

3118
02:06:57,930 --> 02:06:58,490
Goodbye.

3119
02:06:58,490 --> 02:06:59,550
Oh, shit!

3120
02:07:00,370 --> 02:07:01,150
Never mind.

3121
02:07:05,050 --> 02:07:05,570
Uh...

3122
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:08,610
Wait, there's another entrance here.

3123
02:07:08,690 --> 02:07:09,470
That means there's loot.

3124
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:12,030
No, it's just a dead end.

3125
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:12,890
Oh my god!

3126
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:14,610
It baited me!

3127
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:17,590
It knows all I want is loot!

3128
02:07:19,270 --> 02:07:20,190
Okay, this way.

3129
02:07:22,210 --> 02:07:25,390
I assume there's like nothing on the other side, right?

3130
02:07:26,030 --> 02:07:26,550
Oh!

3131
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:28,190
Oh, that's awkward.

3132
02:07:28,350 --> 02:07:28,530
Oh!

3133
02:07:31,050 --> 02:07:31,870
Oh no.

3134
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:32,950
It saw...

3135
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:34,110
Guys, it was strat.

3136
02:07:34,610 --> 02:07:37,050
I died so I can be on the other side.

3137
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:39,170
See?

3138
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:40,890
It was a strat.

3139
02:07:41,610 --> 02:07:44,390
They couldn't chase me because I was on the other side.

3140
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:47,050
You're so smart, Doki.

3141
02:07:47,150 --> 02:07:48,190
Guys, where's my...

3142
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:49,550
You're so smart, Doki.

3143
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:50,290
Puss.

3144
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:51,810
Where is it?

3145
02:07:53,670 --> 02:07:55,150
Where is my echo chamber?

3146
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:01,550
You're so...

3147
02:08:01,550 --> 02:08:02,470
Oh, Alex!

3148
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:05,510
Oh, you didn't have to say that out of your own free will.

3149
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:11,190
Oh my god, that's so sweet, Alex.

3150
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:13,390
Guys, why can't you be more like Alex?

3151
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:15,910
Okay.

3152
02:08:16,610 --> 02:08:17,070
Whoa.

3153
02:08:17,870 --> 02:08:18,650
Upper punch.

3154
02:08:20,490 --> 02:08:21,490
Oh, I love it.

3155
02:08:21,530 --> 02:08:22,070
It's aimbot.

3156
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:25,070
Wait, the punches are aimbot.

3157
02:08:25,110 --> 02:08:25,130
Oh, I love it.

3158
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:25,330
I love it.

3159
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:25,770
That's great.

3160
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:27,610
Oh my god.

3161
02:08:27,690 --> 02:08:29,710
Guys, be more like...

3162
02:08:31,550 --> 02:08:32,490
Oh my god.

3163
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:34,770
Out of your own free will too, chat?

3164
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:36,650
You guys shouldn't have.

3165
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:42,870
Isn't that great?

3166
02:08:43,610 --> 02:08:46,430
You see, this is why we become streamers.

3167
02:08:46,630 --> 02:08:47,450
Wait, whoops.

3168
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:48,210
Am I okay?

3169
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:50,910
Oh, no, I'm not.

3170
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:53,750
No!

3171
02:08:56,810 --> 02:08:57,390
No!

3172
02:08:57,750 --> 02:08:59,090
I have to redo this.

3173
02:08:59,130 --> 02:08:59,910
Okay, no, I don't.

3174
02:09:00,010 --> 02:09:01,550
Wait, I have to redo this?

3175
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:03,390
Oh my god.

3176
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:06,430
I can't believe it.

3177
02:09:07,550 --> 02:09:08,750
This is not fair.

3178
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:10,470
This is not fair.

3179
02:09:11,770 --> 02:09:15,210
I literally have to redo this entire portion?

3180
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:17,330
It's fucked up.

3181
02:09:17,970 --> 02:09:18,950
It's this way.

3182
02:09:19,430 --> 02:09:21,110
Oh, oh, thief drowned.

3183
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:23,170
Okay.

3184
02:09:23,250 --> 02:09:23,830
I'm gonna go back to the stream.

3185
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:26,470
All right, we're fine.

3186
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:29,310
Nice.

3187
02:09:29,390 --> 02:09:30,690
All right, and then we grab this again.

3188
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:32,130
It's okay.

3189
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:32,570
We're fine.

3190
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:34,050
See, everything is fine.

3191
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:35,570
I can redo this portion.

3192
02:09:35,710 --> 02:09:36,350
I ain't scared.

3193
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:39,950
How much HP do you have?

3194
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:42,390
Okay, not enough, but that's okay.

3195
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:44,210
I won't repeat it again.

3196
02:09:45,470 --> 02:09:45,910
Nice.

3197
02:09:46,090 --> 02:09:46,770
Double hit.

3198
02:09:49,710 --> 02:09:50,590
All right.

3199
02:09:50,810 --> 02:09:52,810
Oh, oh, oh.

3200
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:53,210
Oh.

3201
02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:54,930
All right.

3202
02:09:55,010 --> 02:09:55,370
Nice.

3203
02:09:56,230 --> 02:09:57,630
All right, where's the big boy?

3204
02:09:58,210 --> 02:09:59,590
Big boy, get over here.

3205
02:09:59,630 --> 02:10:00,490
I'm gonna punch you.

3206
02:10:00,690 --> 02:10:02,250
No, big boy!

3207
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:06,630
Who said you can run away?

3208
02:10:07,330 --> 02:10:08,530
Oh, oh, okay.

3209
02:10:08,970 --> 02:10:10,170
Oh, that's not good.

3210
02:10:10,290 --> 02:10:11,050
Oh, that's not good.

3211
02:10:11,150 --> 02:10:12,250
What if I just...

3212
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:12,770
Oh, okay.

3213
02:10:12,990 --> 02:10:15,950
Uh, guys, I did not buy anything.

3214
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:16,570
Okay.

3215
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:17,750
Uh, whoa.

3216
02:10:19,470 --> 02:10:20,270
There we go.

3217
02:10:20,670 --> 02:10:21,250
There we go.

3218
02:10:21,790 --> 02:10:22,230
Nice.

3219
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:24,190
Oh, okay.

3220
02:10:24,270 --> 02:10:26,750
That's not a lot of damage, but like, we'll take what we can get.

3221
02:10:27,950 --> 02:10:28,390
Okay.

3222
02:10:30,650 --> 02:10:32,710
We will take what we can get.

3223
02:10:35,790 --> 02:10:40,550
Oh, guys, I might have fucking did not repair anything.

3224
02:10:45,710 --> 02:10:46,730
Where are we back?

3225
02:10:46,890 --> 02:10:47,470
Oh, we're back.

3226
02:10:47,570 --> 02:10:47,950
Nice.

3227
02:10:48,450 --> 02:10:50,490
I didn't even realize my internet died.

3228
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:56,500
Oh, shit.

3229
02:10:57,140 --> 02:10:58,700
I didn't even realize that.

3230
02:10:58,880 --> 02:10:59,660
Give me a sec.

3231
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,040
I'm gonna reload my chat too.

3232
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:04,920
Are we all good?

3233
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:08,080
Okay, here we go.

3234
02:11:09,580 --> 02:11:10,340
Are we back?

3235
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:14,040
Oh, nice.

3236
02:11:14,140 --> 02:11:14,520
We're back.

3237
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:15,160
Okay, nice.

3238
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:17,160
See, nothing bad happened.

3239
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:18,900
Guys, the entrance is still here.

3240
02:11:20,740 --> 02:11:21,480
Yes, we know.

3241
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:22,620
Take it to the floor above.

3242
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:23,280
Okay.

3243
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:30,160
I think that was on YouTube.

3244
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:33,100
YouTube's been like experiencing some weird shit lately.

3245
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:35,140
It took me like chat was...

3246
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:37,800
I think YouTube servers are like extra fucked.

3247
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,480
I'm pretty sure YouTube servers are like really bad at the moment.

3248
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:47,080
Yeah, yeah.

3249
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:49,540
That one is a YouTube issue.

3250
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:50,240
I know for sure.

3251
02:11:50,980 --> 02:11:56,320
Because like when I started this stream, I had like really weird like I couldn't start my...

3252
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,800
I couldn't start my stream at first.

3253
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,320
Wait, there's like loot there.

3254
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:02,940
How do I get there?

3255
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:04,440
I just jump here.

3256
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:05,560
Oh shit!

3257
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:06,420
Okay, wait.

3258
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:07,500
I think like...

3259
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:08,980
Is this 2D time?

3260
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:10,340
Oh, it is.

3261
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:12,640
That's so weird.

3262
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:18,380
Wait, where would 2D get me?

3263
02:12:20,700 --> 02:12:21,220
Woo!

3264
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:24,640
It's gotta get to me first, loser!

3265
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:26,300
Wait, it just took me by surprise.

3266
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:26,620
I'm back here.

3267
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:28,560
And what's the point of this?

3268
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:30,420
What the fuck was the point?

3269
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:33,400
I don't understand.

3270
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:36,840
Wait, what was the point of the line?

3271
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:39,280
What?

3272
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:42,260
I couldn't...

3273
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:42,680
What?

3274
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:48,260
Okay, this is like one of those like game design question mark.

3275
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:53,240
I'm literally like game design?

3276
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:53,640
Game design?

3277
02:12:53,640 --> 02:12:56,980
Game design?

3278
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:58,960
YouTube is getting more scuffed lately.

3279
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:01,640
I feel like it's just like server issues.

3280
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:06,720
Because the thing about like YouTube servers is that they can't really delete videos.

3281
02:13:07,210 --> 02:13:11,420
So like I'm pretty sure like there's like people out there that are...

3282
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:13,060
Oh, that is not good.

3283
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:19,360
People out there that are intentionally uploading as much content as possible just to fuck with like YouTube servers.

3284
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:23,100
Because like you can't delete content off of YouTube servers.

3285
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:24,800
It's all about like...

3286
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:25,620
They all just...

3287
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:29,780
All they can do is just always expand.

3288
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:38,440
Yeah, all they can do is just keep on expanding and keep on buying more servers to account for like YouTube videos and stuff.

3289
02:13:40,700 --> 02:13:42,540
So I feel like it's like...

3290
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:49,220
It sucks because like they can't really do anything about it in regards to like the people wasting.

3291
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:49,340
Like...

3292
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:50,040
They're wasting YouTube space.

3293
02:13:54,590 --> 02:13:57,770
So like I won't be surprised if that's also an issue.

3294
02:13:58,530 --> 02:14:01,090
Yeah, all those four hour videos are adding up.

3295
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:04,310
All those like...

3296
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:09,710
No, all those videos that like when people search up like, oh, I want to watch this movie but on YouTube.

3297
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:16,970
And it's just like eight hours of like a PNG being like, please visit our website if you want to access...

3298
02:14:16,970 --> 02:14:20,710
If you want to watch this movie illegally and shit like that.

3299
02:14:23,530 --> 02:14:25,350
But like in the end, it's a scam.

3300
02:14:25,610 --> 02:14:26,330
It's just malware.

3301
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:31,130
That shit pisses me off.

3302
02:14:36,250 --> 02:14:37,190
Wouldn't they be able...

3303
02:14:37,190 --> 02:14:38,070
Yeah, but how would they know?

3304
02:14:38,410 --> 02:14:41,530
They don't know if it's actually dead accounts or like...

3305
02:14:41,530 --> 02:14:42,990
Because they don't have like...

3306
02:14:42,990 --> 02:14:44,730
I don't think they legally they can do that.

3307
02:14:46,570 --> 02:14:47,470
I'm pretty sure.

3308
02:14:50,290 --> 02:14:51,310
And you're just like...

3309
02:14:51,310 --> 02:14:54,370
Bro, I thought they'll have like, you know, one out of...

3310
02:14:54,370 --> 02:15:01,270
Remember when people used to upload part one out of 20 for like random shows or TV shows?

3311
02:15:01,730 --> 02:15:03,190
Oh, no, I'm about to die.

3312
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:06,290
All right.

3313
02:15:08,950 --> 02:15:09,950
This way.

3314
02:15:11,830 --> 02:15:12,970
Guys, who said...

3315
02:15:12,970 --> 02:15:14,010
Oh, okay.

3316
02:15:14,730 --> 02:15:16,210
Who said I can't parkour?

3317
02:15:18,630 --> 02:15:20,450
It's not like I almost died or anything.

3318
02:15:23,990 --> 02:15:28,070
I'm pretty sure you can't delete videos off of accounts.

3319
02:15:28,450 --> 02:15:29,550
Because like you can't...

3320
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:31,590
You don't really know if they're actually dead accounts or not.

3321
02:15:31,690 --> 02:15:34,690
What if somebody just randomly logs back in and their account's gone?

3322
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:35,590
That's it.

3323
02:15:35,710 --> 02:15:37,250
Then people will get mad.

3324
02:15:39,650 --> 02:15:42,430
Because you don't know what the situation is.

3325
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:46,770
Like, what if like, you know, they were stuck in a cult for like 20 years.

3326
02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:51,290
They could be stuck in a cult for like 20 years.

3327
02:15:51,290 --> 02:15:52,390
They could be stuck in a cult for 20 years.

3328
02:15:53,470 --> 02:15:54,170
Okay, nice.

3329
02:15:54,210 --> 02:15:54,710
I drank water.

3330
02:15:55,010 --> 02:15:55,790
Stay hydrated.

3331
02:15:57,070 --> 02:15:58,290
And like they just...

3332
02:15:58,290 --> 02:16:00,370
And then like they just got back into access.

3333
02:16:00,690 --> 02:16:02,510
And they finally left the cult.

3334
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:10,450
And then they're like, man, I can't wait to access my YouTube account that I used to own before I joined the cult.

3335
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:11,570
And then it's gone.

3336
02:16:11,670 --> 02:16:12,590
They deleted it.

3337
02:16:14,730 --> 02:16:15,690
You don't know that.

3338
02:16:17,870 --> 02:16:20,870
Well, they're like the one thing that was going to...

3339
02:16:20,870 --> 02:16:25,910
That like put like, you know, after going through 20 years of being in the cult.

3340
02:16:26,050 --> 02:16:33,010
The one thing that was keeping me going was my YouTube account that I still own.

3341
02:16:33,350 --> 02:16:36,310
And I can't wait to get back to it.

3342
02:16:40,830 --> 02:16:42,010
Oh, man.

3343
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:45,270
That was the one thing every day.

3344
02:16:45,330 --> 02:16:50,210
I just think about my YouTube account and I cannot wait to one day.

3345
02:16:50,210 --> 02:16:51,790
Be able to get back on.

3346
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:53,390
And now that I left the cult.

3347
02:17:01,070 --> 02:17:02,290
That would suck.

3348
02:17:03,750 --> 02:17:05,330
That would suck for them.

3349
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:06,930
Wait, how do I?

3350
02:17:10,030 --> 02:17:10,470
Okay.

3351
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:14,630
See, wait, there's like no way to...

3352
02:17:15,870 --> 02:17:16,490
No way.

3353
02:17:16,550 --> 02:17:17,150
Oh, there it is.

3354
02:17:17,210 --> 02:17:19,490
I was like, where the fuck is the thing?

3355
02:17:20,210 --> 02:17:22,510
God, my thing is about to fucking explode.

3356
02:17:25,330 --> 02:17:28,090
It's like, it's like one hit.

3357
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:30,110
A fly is going to land on it.

3358
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:30,790
I'm going to die.

3359
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:37,520
Man.

3360
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:40,460
Yeah, so they can't do anything about it.

3361
02:17:40,580 --> 02:17:40,800
Whoa.

3362
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:44,480
Okay, we're going to have to grab the hover car.

3363
02:17:44,660 --> 02:17:46,200
We're going to bring the hover car into this.

3364
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:48,380
Wait, the hover car does more damage.

3365
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:48,980
What the fuck?

3366
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:51,920
I should have been the hover car this entire time.

3367
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:56,600
We don't talk about the fucking little bullets.

3368
02:17:58,620 --> 02:17:59,100
Nice.

3369
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:04,180
Oh, wait, there has to be more loot behind me.

3370
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:08,240
Wait, there's more?

3371
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,660
What do you mean there's more?

3372
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:13,220
That's not fine.

3373
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:13,820
He can't aim.

3374
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:16,100
That's the best part.

3375
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,520
Oh, wait, I can't do anything now.

3376
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:19,500
I just have to stand there.

3377
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:20,700
All right.

3378
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:20,980
Nice.

3379
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:21,720
He's dead.

3380
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:26,400
Give me the materials I need to upgrade.

3381
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:28,660
No.

3382
02:18:34,020 --> 02:18:34,540
Nice.

3383
02:18:35,180 --> 02:18:35,860
All right.

3384
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:40,200
That means there could be loot over here.

3385
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:43,680
Because there's a door here and that's yellow.

3386
02:18:43,980 --> 02:18:44,820
It's yellow.

3387
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:47,680
Gary, thank you for the super chat.

3388
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:48,020
Thank you.

3389
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:49,220
Hey, y'all.

3390
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:51,640
Just got back from watching a movie at my brother's place.

3391
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:52,480
How's everyone doing?

3392
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:53,120
We're doing great.

3393
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:56,960
We're making progress, I think.

3394
02:18:57,740 --> 02:18:58,580
Is there loot?

3395
02:18:59,160 --> 02:18:59,660
Yellow!

3396
02:19:01,220 --> 02:19:02,300
I love yellow.

3397
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:06,920
But where do I go after that?

3398
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:10,580
What do I do after here?

3399
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:11,860
Okay.

3400
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:13,780
How do I?

3401
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:15,460
Oh, is it bike time?

3402
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:17,320
It's bike time, right?

3403
02:19:18,220 --> 02:19:19,140
That should be.

3404
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:21,140
Okay.

3405
02:19:21,140 --> 02:19:21,300
Okay.

3406
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:22,780
I gotta...

3407
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:25,120
It's bike time.

3408
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:27,980
I just need to get the position correct.

3409
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:28,420
All right.

3410
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:29,640
Bike time!

3411
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:30,500
Woo!

3412
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:32,680
Oh, nice.

3413
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:34,520
Wait, that was so cool.

3414
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:36,220
That was like some Akira shit right there.

3415
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:40,080
And then is there more loot back here?

3416
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:41,940
There has to be.

3417
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:43,640
There's bins here.

3418
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:47,960
Getting all this loot, but Doki doesn't even upgrade.

3419
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:52,420
Doki, what's the point?

3420
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:53,760
You don't even upgrade.

3421
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:56,380
That's the principle of things, okay?

3422
02:19:58,020 --> 02:19:58,620
All right.

3423
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:00,820
I have to go here.

3424
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:02,300
You watch Akira?

3425
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:03,680
No, I just know about the slide.

3426
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:05,100
Everybody knows.

3427
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:05,540
Okay.

3428
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:06,640
Like, I understand.

3429
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:09,500
It's like the reference of all time.

3430
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:15,660
But it's like, I feel like animation companies always do that reference.

3431
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:19,500
It's always that reference.

3432
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:23,740
There's like so many Akira moments, but it's always the motorcycle slide.

3433
02:20:28,030 --> 02:20:29,390
Because it's cool.

3434
02:20:33,970 --> 02:20:37,470
It's like the reference to make.

3435
02:20:37,770 --> 02:20:39,490
It's like to let everybody know that you...

3436
02:20:39,490 --> 02:20:41,110
I feel like it's like the...

3437
02:20:41,810 --> 02:20:42,410
Okay.

3438
02:20:42,470 --> 02:20:45,030
It's to let everybody know that you watch anime.

3439
02:20:45,330 --> 02:20:46,630
Like, you know, for like Western.

3440
02:20:47,410 --> 02:20:48,390
Western shows.

3441
02:20:48,710 --> 02:20:52,710
It's like the calling card to be like, yeah, I watch anime.

3442
02:20:52,950 --> 02:20:54,090
Inserts Akira slide.

3443
02:21:01,110 --> 02:21:02,370
It's very cool.

3444
02:21:02,490 --> 02:21:04,250
You wouldn't get it, Doki.

3445
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:06,210
I just think it's funny.

3446
02:21:06,430 --> 02:21:07,110
It's always...

3447
02:21:07,110 --> 02:21:07,970
That's like...

3448
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:13,010
That's like always the Easter egg to let everybody know that you're an anime watcher.

3449
02:21:19,930 --> 02:21:20,550
Let's see.

3450
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:21,450
Is the ad...

3451
02:21:21,450 --> 02:21:22,710
Yes, it is like the...

3452
02:21:23,190 --> 02:21:23,610
It's like...

3453
02:21:23,610 --> 02:21:24,630
It's like the calling card.

3454
02:21:24,770 --> 02:21:28,490
It's like how would these people know that I also watch anime?

3455
02:21:30,850 --> 02:21:31,990
Yeah, it's like...

3456
02:21:31,990 --> 02:21:33,370
It's the anime reference.

3457
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:36,310
It's literally the reference to let everybody know.

3458
02:21:38,810 --> 02:21:39,890
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

3459
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:41,550
Why did it just gently put it down?

3460
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:43,590
Okay, there we go.

3461
02:21:43,790 --> 02:21:44,730
Oh my God.

3462
02:21:47,110 --> 02:21:48,770
Is an anime mainstream now?

3463
02:21:48,930 --> 02:21:50,350
You think it is, but it's not.

3464
02:21:50,790 --> 02:21:52,730
Normies do not watch anime still.

3465
02:21:53,270 --> 02:21:54,210
But we have...

3466
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:55,150
We're getting more...

3467
02:21:55,150 --> 02:21:56,590
We're infiltrating.

3468
02:21:57,370 --> 02:22:00,290
Like I say, where would I barely watch anime as well?

3469
02:22:01,050 --> 02:22:03,570
I mean, I'm out here watching Young Sheldon.

3470
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:04,490
I'm part of the norm.

3471
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:05,370
I'm part of the problem.

3472
02:22:09,700 --> 02:22:10,520
Oh my God.

3473
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:11,660
I think there's like this...

3474
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:12,640
Apparently, there's this...

3475
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:14,180
There's like...

3476
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:16,260
I don't know if he's like famous or anything.

3477
02:22:16,260 --> 02:22:18,060
But there's like this football...

3478
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:21,180
NFL football player that was like...

3479
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:23,060
I love Pokemon.

3480
02:22:23,320 --> 02:22:24,100
Like he did like...

3481
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:27,180
He was at like a Pokemon convention or something.

3482
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:28,820
And he's like, why are you...

3483
02:22:28,820 --> 02:22:31,380
And then he was in an interview and he was like, why?

3484
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:32,960
And then the interview was like, why are you here?

3485
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:34,440
And he's just like, I like Pokemon.

3486
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:41,900
I love his response.

3487
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:45,280
And he's like some NFL player or some shit.

3488
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:49,160
I think they're neat.

3489
02:22:51,220 --> 02:22:52,740
Is it Jamel Williams?

3490
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:53,860
And then he...

3491
02:22:53,860 --> 02:22:54,620
And then he...

3492
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:58,340
Apparently, NFL has these like introductions and shit.

3493
02:22:58,480 --> 02:23:00,300
And he made like a Naruto intro.

3494
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:01,360
Wait, I need to show you guys.

3495
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:01,940
Wait, okay.

3496
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:03,420
This is like very off topic.

3497
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:05,160
But I have to show you guys.

3498
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:06,200
It's so fucking funny.

3499
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:07,540
Let me upgrade this first.

3500
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:09,680
Let me get stronger.

3501
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:11,180
Wait, let me see if I can find it.

3502
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:12,180
It's so fucking...

3503
02:23:12,180 --> 02:23:13,240
It's like such a...

3504
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:15,380
It's like such a funny video.

3505
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:19,220
Sean, thank you for the super chat.

3506
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:19,840
Thank you, thank you.

3507
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:23,080
No, you're supposed to keep dormies out of my...

3508
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:28,860
Is his name Jamel Williams?

3509
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:30,320
Okay, Naruto.

3510
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:32,120
Is it that one?

3511
02:23:32,380 --> 02:23:33,220
Oh, here we go.

3512
02:23:34,820 --> 02:23:35,480
Here, here.

3513
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:45,780
It reminds me of the Jordan Peele skin.

3514
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:51,180
Oh, wait.

3515
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,440
My Chrome was on.

3516
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:53,980
But it's so funny.

3517
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:58,980
That shit is so funny.

3518
02:23:59,260 --> 02:24:01,580
I was like, what is he doing here?

3519
02:24:05,620 --> 02:24:06,960
Bro, and then he was at like...

3520
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:09,480
Like I said, he was at like some fucking Pokemon convention.

3521
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:12,660
Because an enumerator found him and was like, what are you doing here?

3522
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:14,020
And he's like, I like Pokemon.

3523
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:21,480
It's always crazy to see.

3524
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:24,180
And then there was like this famous singer.

3525
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:25,520
I don't know who it...

3526
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:29,380
I don't keep up with like pop culture stuff these days.

3527
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:32,860
But there's apparently a famous normie singer.

3528
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:35,020
Like a singer that normies love.

3529
02:24:35,320 --> 02:24:37,900
That like loves anime and shit.

3530
02:24:38,180 --> 02:24:39,160
And she like...

3531
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:43,280
During one of her concerts, she showed everybody her JJK plushie.

3532
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:44,620
I was just like, what?

3533
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:51,700
She like just pulled up a JJK plushie and was like, look at this.

3534
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:53,240
Was it Megan Thee Stallion?

3535
02:24:53,380 --> 02:24:54,040
I don't remember.

3536
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:55,480
I just thought it was so funny.

3537
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:57,000
I thought it...

3538
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:02,240
I thought it was so funny that she like pulled...

3539
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:03,120
Like she brought her...

3540
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:04,880
Brought the plushie to the stage.

3541
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:06,680
And was like, look at this.

3542
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:13,280
Was it Megan Thee Stallion?

3543
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:14,680
Wait, I need to get to this video.

3544
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:16,220
I saw it on Twitter.

3545
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:19,520
I thought it was so fucking funny.

3546
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:22,940
Like in the middle of her set, she just pulls up JJK.

3547
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:26,280
I was like, what the fuck?

3548
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:28,780
Alright, we got to get rid of these guys.

3549
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:29,960
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

3550
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:31,860
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

3551
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:32,680
Please.

3552
02:25:33,060 --> 02:25:35,000
This is supposed to be a race.

3553
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:37,020
How did he get there so fast?

3554
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:39,780
There's security in here.

3555
02:25:39,980 --> 02:25:41,800
How did he not trigger security?

3556
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:44,420
And all the security is on me.

3557
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:46,380
I can't understand.

3558
02:25:47,660 --> 02:25:49,680
There's clearly security here.

3559
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:53,440
Why am I the one that has to deal security?

3560
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:55,280
He was in front of me!

3561
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:01,420
He was literally in front of me!

3562
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:04,360
He has stuff.

3563
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:06,440
This is why I'm going to become a bounty hunter.

3564
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:07,540
This is fucking why.

3565
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:09,760
Who cares about stuff when you're a bounty hunter?

3566
02:26:10,860 --> 02:26:12,280
You just pew pew pew pew.

3567
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:16,960
Alright.

3568
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:19,580
Let's see.

3569
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:22,020
Where do I have to go?

3570
02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:23,660
Where's the door?

3571
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:25,160
Oh there's the door.

3572
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:26,020
Okay let me pull up.

3573
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:27,200
I need to pull up that video now.

3574
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:28,140
I need to...

3575
02:26:28,140 --> 02:26:29,960
I don't know if it is her.

3576
02:26:31,580 --> 02:26:35,440
Megan Stallion, JJK plushie.

3577
02:26:36,420 --> 02:26:37,140
Was it her?

3578
02:26:37,420 --> 02:26:38,580
Wait, does it even like...

3579
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:39,980
Does it even show up?

3580
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:42,260
Does it even...

3581
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:44,200
Okay, plushie concert.

3582
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:46,980
What's this?

3583
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:49,660
Megan Stallion live.

3584
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:51,380
Oh wait, I think it is!

3585
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:53,640
When does she bring up the plushie?

3586
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:54,820
When does she...

3587
02:26:56,540 --> 02:26:56,900
Guys!

3588
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:00,840
Guys, where do I find the plushie scene?

3589
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:02,440
Okay.

3590
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:04,560
I can't find it.

3591
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:05,080
I give up.

3592
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:06,240
That is like my extent.

3593
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:09,120
I look for five seconds and I give up.

3594
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:10,180
There you go.

3595
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:12,340
There is a clip.

3596
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:13,200
Yeah, I saw the clip.

3597
02:27:13,260 --> 02:27:14,060
I don't know where I saw it.

3598
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:15,220
I think I saw it on Twitter.

3599
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:19,480
I don't even know where to look.

3600
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:24,940
Alright, up we go.

3601
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:28,800
I'm tired of all the battleship dungeons.

3602
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:33,720
Oh, thank fucking God we made it.

3603
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:42,340
Oh, it was on Reddit?

3604
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:43,520
Oh, hey, there it is.

3605
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:44,260
We are here.

3606
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:48,920
Ow!

3607
02:27:49,580 --> 02:27:51,040
It doesn't make sense!

3608
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:52,520
Didn't I tell you back at Staranis Gruins?

3609
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:53,360
Emperor's New Groove meme.

3610
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:55,020
Nobody is faster than me.

3611
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:58,160
Oh my God.

3612
02:27:58,380 --> 02:28:01,100
It reminds me that Emperor's New Groove had no script.

3613
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:02,600
Looks to me like victory is out.

3614
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:15,440
Wait, what?

3615
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:17,280
Wait, that's Dragon Ball Z.

3616
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:18,840
It's Zaka!

3617
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:22,700
Bro, he got fucking stabbed by a knife and he's okay?

3618
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:26,320
He literally got slashed by a knife by a fucking mecha.

3619
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:31,920
That was like 50 broken bones right there.

3620
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:35,280
Wait, that's the Dragon Ball robot!

3621
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:41,660
It's just a knife.

3622
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:43,960
Oh shit.

3623
02:29:01,480 --> 02:29:03,620
The blade is really dull.

3624
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:05,120
You don't understand, Doki.

3625
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:08,240
Yeah, I saved your life.

3626
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:12,880
Guys, we have a problem.

3627
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:17,120
As in like all my robots have like very low HP.

3628
02:29:21,740 --> 02:29:25,980
Wait, it's the Dragon Ball Z robot with like Cell's tail.

3629
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:31,240
Oh my God.

3630
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:36,120
Battleship Defender.

3631
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:37,380
That's what I'm saying!

3632
02:29:37,380 --> 02:29:41,440
How come now they fucking fight the fucking other general?

3633
02:29:41,780 --> 02:29:41,920
Fine.

3634
02:29:42,900 --> 02:29:44,080
Do what you need to.

3635
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:44,800
Isn't that...

3636
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:45,220
Whoa!

3637
02:29:46,320 --> 02:29:47,440
Bro, it's so fast!

3638
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:49,860
That's right.

3639
02:29:49,900 --> 02:29:50,940
I can fly too.

3640
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:52,100
What you gonna do?

3641
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:52,760
Oh, miss.

3642
02:29:52,900 --> 02:29:53,120
Okay.

3643
02:29:53,220 --> 02:29:53,780
That's fine.

3644
02:29:54,020 --> 02:29:55,640
It's better if it gets closer to me.

3645
02:29:55,720 --> 02:29:57,880
Just cause like I can't aim on the tank.

3646
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:00,120
Bro, it's okay.

3647
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:01,520
That's fucking it.

3648
02:30:01,620 --> 02:30:02,260
Get in here.

3649
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:04,100
Whoa!

3650
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:05,460
Get in here.

3651
02:30:05,460 --> 02:30:08,020
I am not doing any damage.

3652
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:09,260
Get in here, Raul.

3653
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:10,080
I need help.

3654
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:12,120
Raul!

3655
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:14,820
I should have upgraded my tank!

3656
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:19,400
Yeah!

3657
02:30:19,460 --> 02:30:21,660
I should have upgraded!

3658
02:30:22,620 --> 02:30:23,940
Oh shit!

3659
02:30:24,060 --> 02:30:24,460
Okay.

3660
02:30:25,380 --> 02:30:26,480
Guys, I don't...

3661
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:27,800
Oh my God!

3662
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:30,820
Jesus Christ!

3663
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:32,020
Okay, okay.

3664
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:32,820
Give me a sec.

3665
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:35,080
We gonna armor up.

3666
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:36,300
And then firepower.

3667
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:39,240
Like, this is the only way.

3668
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:41,260
I feel like...

3669
02:30:41,860 --> 02:30:43,120
I feel like we...

3670
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:43,960
No!

3671
02:30:45,260 --> 02:30:45,740
No!

3672
02:30:45,820 --> 02:30:46,760
Okay, I was gonna say it.

3673
02:30:46,760 --> 02:30:47,480
This is bullshit.

3674
02:30:47,480 --> 02:30:48,680
The moment I...

3675
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:53,280
I have the power up for this and I miss every shot.

3676
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:53,780
Woo!

3677
02:30:54,820 --> 02:30:56,400
Bro, this guy hits so hard!

3678
02:30:56,900 --> 02:30:57,380
What?!

3679
02:30:57,380 --> 02:30:58,960
Oh, this is very bad.

3680
02:30:59,060 --> 02:30:59,600
This is very bad.

3681
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:00,260
Swap bots.

3682
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:00,540
No!

3683
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:02,820
I couldn't swap!

3684
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:06,360
Oh no.

3685
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:07,540
Does Cassine heal?

3686
02:31:08,020 --> 02:31:09,780
If it heals, I can go for...

3687
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:10,860
Guys, it does not heal.

3688
02:31:10,980 --> 02:31:12,360
Guys, it does not heal.

3689
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:13,080
Guys!

3690
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:15,980
Guys, it does not heal, guys.

3691
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:19,820
That's awkward.

3692
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:28,920
Oh no, I made this a lot harder.

3693
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:31,700
Okay.

3694
02:31:32,380 --> 02:31:33,000
It's okay.

3695
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,260
Holy shit.

3696
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,420
I...

3697
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:41,240
I made this a lot harder than I should have, guys.

3698
02:31:41,780 --> 02:31:42,320
Guys!

3699
02:31:44,740 --> 02:31:45,920
This is...

3700
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,380
This is not good.

3701
02:31:49,880 --> 02:31:52,560
I definitely made this a lot harder.

3702
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:55,960
Cooked unless...

3703
02:31:57,580 --> 02:31:58,320
Unless...

3704
02:32:00,520 --> 02:32:02,500
Okay, we can play this passively.

3705
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:03,840
Nice.

3706
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:05,080
We can do this.

3707
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:06,920
Guys, there is...

3708
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,320
There is hope for us.

3709
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:11,540
I can take like two shots.

3710
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:15,740
I can take so many shots, guys.

3711
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:16,100
Woo!

3712
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:18,980
If I just do this, we're fine.

3713
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:20,220
Woo!

3714
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:22,020
Guys!

3715
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:27,580
We might not be as fine as we thought.

3716
02:32:28,820 --> 02:32:29,860
Oh shit!

3717
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:31,440
Oh shit!

3718
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:31,700
Holy shit.

3719
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:36,640
Oh, no!

3720
02:32:37,660 --> 02:32:39,060
Oh, no!

3721
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:41,700
Looking good!

3722
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:45,280
Oh, my God.

3723
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:49,340
Oh, my God, okay.

3724
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:49,560
Okay.

3725
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:51,640
Oh, I have other tiers in my inventory!

3726
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:53,280
Oh, thank god!

3727
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:53,800
Okay.

3728
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:54,980
Guys!

3729
02:32:55,460 --> 02:32:56,780
Oh my god!

3730
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:00,180
Guys.

3731
02:33:00,180 --> 02:33:00,800
Guys.

3732
02:33:00,980 --> 02:33:02,440
It's okay now.

3733
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:04,480
That's fucking right.

3734
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:05,440
I'm back, bitch!

3735
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,020
I'm back!

3736
02:33:07,140 --> 02:33:08,180
Oh, shit.

3737
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:08,900
Okay, it's fine.

3738
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:10,500
It's fine.

3739
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:12,040
Thank you, backseating!

3740
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:16,380
This is why I love backseating.

3741
02:33:18,740 --> 02:33:20,340
I love backseating!

3742
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:21,600
I love backseating!

3743
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:21,620
Yay!

3744
02:33:23,620 --> 02:33:25,000
Okay, we gotta heal again.

3745
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:27,900
Okay.

3746
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:29,560
Backseating!

3747
02:33:29,780 --> 02:33:30,180
Yay!

3748
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:32,380
Woo!

3749
02:33:34,380 --> 02:33:35,220
Okay, don't worry.

3750
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:35,680
I can guard.

3751
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:36,960
Oh, did you see that?

3752
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:37,320
See that?

3753
02:33:38,140 --> 02:33:39,480
I can guard!

3754
02:33:40,700 --> 02:33:41,200
Yeah!

3755
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:43,820
That's fucking right.

3756
02:33:44,220 --> 02:33:45,380
That's fucking right!

3757
02:33:45,440 --> 02:33:46,100
Get over here!

3758
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:47,820
I learned!

3759
02:33:50,220 --> 02:33:51,780
Zeon with the clutch!

3760
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:53,080
Woo!

3761
02:33:53,980 --> 02:33:54,840
That's fucking right.

3762
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:55,740
We're gonna do nothing!

3763
02:33:57,320 --> 02:33:58,260
Oh, shit!

3764
02:33:58,740 --> 02:33:59,520
Oh, shit!

3765
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:00,880
Guys, hey!

3766
02:34:00,980 --> 02:34:02,500
Can you guys like help me out too?

3767
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:04,940
What do you mean you can't help?

3768
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:06,760
What do you mean?

3769
02:34:08,840 --> 02:34:09,580
Don't worry.

3770
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:11,400
I'm gonna stay over here.

3771
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:15,960
I can't believe he said he can't help me!

3772
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:18,420
Wait, I can lock on target.

3773
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:19,420
I forgot about that.

3774
02:34:19,940 --> 02:34:20,720
There we go.

3775
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:23,340
Okay, don't worry.

3776
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:24,480
Uppercut!

3777
02:34:24,620 --> 02:34:25,140
Yeah!

3778
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:26,080
Boom!

3779
02:34:26,580 --> 02:34:26,700
Oh!

3780
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:28,200
And then the finisher!

3781
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:29,440
Nice!

3782
02:34:29,480 --> 02:34:29,900
Guard!

3783
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:31,600
Guard!

3784
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:32,720
Nice!

3785
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:33,960
Okay.

3786
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:35,860
We're good.

3787
02:34:35,940 --> 02:34:36,200
We're good.

3788
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:36,800
And then...

3789
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:37,280
Boost!

3790
02:34:38,220 --> 02:34:39,480
And then uppercut!

3791
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:41,760
And then downcut!

3792
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:42,620
Yeah!

3793
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:44,100
It's a fighting game now!

3794
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:45,380
Let's go!

3795
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:48,420
Let's go!

3796
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:49,240
The combo launcher!

3797
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:52,340
And we're gonna do about it...

3798
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:53,160
Nothing!

3799
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:55,660
Boom!

3800
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:56,220
Oh, shit!

3801
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:57,640
Oh, shit!

3802
02:34:57,700 --> 02:34:57,860
Oh!

3803
02:34:58,240 --> 02:34:58,840
It's okay.

3804
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:01,360
I have all the heals.

3805
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:03,280
Rylal, go in there!

3806
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:05,520
Shoot your missile!

3807
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:06,820
That's right!

3808
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:07,900
Kill Rylal!

3809
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:08,720
Don't kill me!

3810
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:10,580
Oh, whoops!

3811
02:35:11,300 --> 02:35:12,900
I messed up that, but that's okay.

3812
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:15,280
Oh, that's fine.

3813
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:15,380
I'm gonna die.

3814
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:16,700
Oh!

3815
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:19,120
That's fucking right!

3816
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:20,400
No!

3817
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:22,180
Rylal, you don't get this!

3818
02:35:23,140 --> 02:35:24,180
Go for the grab!

3819
02:35:28,220 --> 02:35:29,060
Harvest him!

3820
02:35:30,980 --> 02:35:33,560
Harvest him and add him to my mecha collection!

3821
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:35,560
...the core frame at least.

3822
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:41,120
Hey, Terrain on your parade, but we don't have much time to spare now.

3823
02:35:41,900 --> 02:35:42,760
I know.

3824
02:35:43,580 --> 02:35:45,820
Let's get the Aquanium from the engine room.

3825
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:52,840
R B plus A to make...

3826
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:53,580
When the... what?

3827
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:54,800
How did I get this upgrade?

3828
02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:01,420
How the fuck did the bezel buffs just suddenly learn how to metallize?

3829
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:02,240
Like...

3830
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:05,180
That came out of nowhere.

3831
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:07,980
I just suddenly received the upgrade.

3832
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:10,760
I know, I was like, what?

3833
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:14,080
It was so nonchalant.

3834
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:16,160
I just received it.

3835
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:19,940
Out of nowhere.

3836
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:23,280
I can't believe it.

3837
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:25,320
I have other items in my inventory?

3838
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:27,360
Holy shit chat.

3839
02:36:31,460 --> 02:36:32,880
Isn't that crazy?

3840
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:34,680
We're the first ones to the engine room.

3841
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:37,680
Which means we win!

3842
02:36:44,260 --> 02:36:44,900
Good.

3843
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:46,260
I found the Aquanium.

3844
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:47,980
I wonder if we'll ever see the sister.

3845
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:50,920
Close the capsule valve, just like Pollock did.

3846
02:36:54,630 --> 02:36:55,510
There we go.

3847
02:36:57,010 --> 02:36:59,690
Now it shouldn't show up on the Aquanium radar.

3848
02:37:02,170 --> 02:37:02,690
Alright.

3849
02:37:02,690 --> 02:37:04,050
Let's report to Longo.

3850
02:37:04,190 --> 02:37:04,510
Eh?

3851
02:37:05,250 --> 02:37:08,250
We've gotta tell him there's no more need to come here.

3852
02:37:09,250 --> 02:37:09,770
Right.

3853
02:37:10,110 --> 02:37:11,070
We did it!

3854
02:37:11,170 --> 02:37:12,030
We got the thing!

3855
02:37:13,470 --> 02:37:14,930
We did our job!

3856
02:37:16,970 --> 02:37:17,530
Alright.

3857
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:19,510
No, did...

3858
02:37:19,510 --> 02:37:21,710
Did she actually... wait, is she dead?

3859
02:37:22,030 --> 02:37:23,210
How could she be dead?

3860
02:37:25,130 --> 02:37:26,110
There's no way.

3861
02:37:27,150 --> 02:37:30,910
I feel like if she was dead, like, Beelzebub would be more sad.

3862
02:37:32,230 --> 02:37:33,250
I feel like.

3863
02:37:36,210 --> 02:37:37,210
Okay, it's this way.

3864
02:37:37,370 --> 02:37:37,730
Alright.

3865
02:37:39,950 --> 02:37:41,230
And I... I...

3866
02:37:41,670 --> 02:37:44,870
I feel like winning the King and her...

3867
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:46,390
Yeah, I feel like...

3868
02:37:46,390 --> 02:37:49,430
She would... like, I would know if she was dead.

3869
02:37:53,370 --> 02:37:53,890
Okay.

3870
02:37:54,130 --> 02:37:54,890
We killed all...

3871
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:56,650
Well, I feel like there wasn't...

3872
02:37:56,650 --> 02:37:58,930
There was no demons in Forest Land.

3873
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:00,450
Because all the demons were in Sand Land.

3874
02:38:01,050 --> 02:38:02,330
Sand Land is like...

3875
02:38:02,850 --> 02:38:03,370
Patient...

3876
02:38:03,370 --> 02:38:05,150
Sand Land is like the origin of demons.

3877
02:38:05,870 --> 02:38:06,390
Apparently.

3878
02:38:07,650 --> 02:38:09,990
And everybody else were just invasive species.

3879
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:15,760
Yeah, I feel like she has to be still alive.

3880
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:19,000
Yeah, that's some Forest Land propaganda.

3881
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:20,300
Apparently.

3882
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:22,840
I can jump off?

3883
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:24,160
Oh no, I just head downstairs.

3884
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:25,340
I was like is that...

3885
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:26,940
Is that just a fucking cliff?

3886
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:28,900
Oh, Secret Item.

3887
02:38:30,420 --> 02:38:31,060
Secret...

3888
02:38:31,060 --> 02:38:31,420
Ta-da.

3889
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:34,440
Fuck the Avatar Live Action Series.

3890
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:38,500
I know that was out of nowhere, but...

3891
02:38:38,500 --> 02:38:39,860
I remember that song.

3892
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:40,840
And Avatar.

3893
02:38:40,980 --> 02:38:42,860
The Live Action Series was fucking...

3894
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:43,360
Shit.

3895
02:38:50,530 --> 02:38:51,150
Shit.

3896
02:38:51,150 --> 02:38:54,010
It was just... it was just... I don't know.

3897
02:38:54,370 --> 02:38:56,290
I ranted about it before.

3898
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:58,330
The Avatar live action.

3899
02:38:58,510 --> 02:39:00,030
Like yeah, the CGI was amazing.

3900
02:39:00,590 --> 02:39:01,830
But like...

3901
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:07,490
The story was like...

3902
02:39:07,880 --> 02:39:09,270
The writing was not great.

3903
02:39:09,570 --> 02:39:10,410
I'll say it.

3904
02:39:10,530 --> 02:39:13,570
If the creators of Avatar left...

3905
02:39:13,570 --> 02:39:16,010
There was a... like I can see why.

3906
02:39:17,410 --> 02:39:19,610
I can see why they left.

3907
02:39:24,020 --> 02:39:27,380
Just the story was just... I hate what they did to Sokka.

3908
02:39:29,480 --> 02:39:33,860
Like he has barely any character development now because of...

3909
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:36,220
Because they removed...

3910
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:40,260
They removed his character development which was fucking weird.

3911
02:39:40,660 --> 02:39:42,200
I thought it was just weird.

3912
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:45,220
I think he used a hover bot.

3913
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:48,940
Oh my god!

3914
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:50,920
My ride is not doing okay.

3915
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:51,380
It's okay.

3916
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:52,600
The cutscene will heal me.

3917
02:39:53,980 --> 02:39:56,020
The cutscene will heal me, guys!

3918
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:57,540
I'll get to a cutscene!

3919
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:58,540
There's no more bosses!

3920
02:39:59,020 --> 02:40:00,020
I'm pretty sure.

3921
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:02,040
Right?

3922
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:05,140
There can't be anymore bosses!

3923
02:40:14,450 --> 02:40:15,950
I saved your life!

3924
02:40:16,030 --> 02:40:16,850
You owe me now!

3925
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:30,570
That's right.

3926
02:40:31,570 --> 02:40:33,430
Now you're my minion!

3927
02:40:38,910 --> 02:40:42,490
God, when you say Aquanium, it just doesn't fit.

3928
02:40:42,930 --> 02:40:45,090
Nobody fits with the Aquanium.

3929
02:40:50,270 --> 02:40:53,270
I'll follow you there... or anywhere.

3930
02:40:53,490 --> 02:40:54,390
Don't worry, sir.

3931
02:40:54,530 --> 02:40:56,150
You can make money through other means.

3932
02:41:01,150 --> 02:41:02,270
No, Beezabub!

3933
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:03,530
What the fuck are you doing?

3934
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:07,870
What the fuck?

3935
02:41:07,910 --> 02:41:10,390
The Aquanium is used to destroy the world?

3936
02:41:13,850 --> 02:41:15,130
Beezabub, you idiot!

3937
02:41:19,090 --> 02:41:22,190
The Aquanium is used to destroy the world!

3938
02:41:25,550 --> 02:41:26,930
And they're okay!

3939
02:41:36,490 --> 02:41:37,530
Later then.

3940
02:41:37,650 --> 02:41:39,250
How are they okay with it?

3941
02:41:39,410 --> 02:41:40,350
Like, they're just like, alright.

3942
02:41:42,590 --> 02:41:46,510
Before delivering this Aquanium to Supreme Commander Bread...

3943
02:41:46,510 --> 02:41:48,630
Yeah, but why is everyone okay with it?

3944
02:41:48,990 --> 02:41:52,090
We'll store it near Crump Army Research Lab, right?

3945
02:41:53,630 --> 02:41:55,210
Oh, I see.

3946
02:41:55,670 --> 02:41:55,690
That's right.

3947
02:41:55,690 --> 02:41:57,410
But we can't leave it there for long.

3948
02:41:57,570 --> 02:41:58,510
I see.

3949
02:41:58,650 --> 02:42:01,610
So it's not his fault if it gets stolen.

3950
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:05,050
But how did he know that he would have followed along?

3951
02:42:06,090 --> 02:42:08,290
Now our official reports can wait.

3952
02:42:08,790 --> 02:42:10,850
Let's go see how Femons do it.

3953
02:42:10,850 --> 02:42:12,290
Bro, that was such a huge gamble.

3954
02:42:12,490 --> 02:42:14,210
He could have been like, fuck you guys.

3955
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:20,630
It sounds like he's giving us a chance to nab it for ourselves.

3956
02:42:22,150 --> 02:42:23,190
Oh, really?

3957
02:42:23,790 --> 02:42:25,910
Yeah, that was such a huge gamble.

3958
02:42:26,190 --> 02:42:27,650
That man is something else.

3959
02:42:30,190 --> 02:42:34,850
Yeah, you don't know for sure if he fucking was gonna let us use it.

3960
02:42:34,910 --> 02:42:35,910
Okay, we need the water.

3961
02:42:36,050 --> 02:42:36,430
We're...

3962
02:42:36,430 --> 02:42:38,490
We need water right now.

3963
02:42:40,070 --> 02:42:41,130
Hey, there's Lito.

3964
02:42:41,270 --> 02:42:42,630
Where the heck is the water?

3965
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:45,770
Okay, where's the water though?

3966
02:42:46,530 --> 02:42:47,050
Guys.

3967
02:42:47,610 --> 02:42:48,670
Where's... Oh, there it is.

3968
02:42:48,870 --> 02:42:49,270
Okay.

3969
02:42:49,270 --> 02:42:51,590
Okay, apparently you can use... Maybe...

3970
02:42:52,770 --> 02:42:55,490
Maybe... Maybe I can like heal my car.

3971
02:42:56,470 --> 02:42:57,950
Can you heal my car?

3972
02:43:01,530 --> 02:43:02,810
Alright, nevermind.

3973
02:43:02,970 --> 02:43:04,410
Oh wait, there's like...

3974
02:43:09,730 --> 02:43:11,950
Wait, there's...

3975
02:43:19,270 --> 02:43:20,950
I'm surprised how many people live in the capital.

3976
02:43:21,130 --> 02:43:21,910
We can use this.

3977
02:43:21,990 --> 02:43:22,910
We can repair it.

3978
02:43:23,010 --> 02:43:25,270
We have... Oh yeah, we definitely have a lot.

3979
02:43:27,530 --> 02:43:29,930
Oh, why do I only... Oh, I need to go to a campsite.

3980
02:43:29,930 --> 02:43:30,290
Okay.

3981
02:43:33,550 --> 02:43:33,970
Yay!

3982
02:43:36,470 --> 02:43:36,890
Alright.

3983
02:43:37,190 --> 02:43:38,930
Now for some hard intel on the area.

3984
02:43:39,270 --> 02:43:41,170
Alright, there is like a spot over here.

3985
02:43:41,250 --> 02:43:41,990
So I wanna see what...

3986
02:43:41,990 --> 02:43:43,710
What materials it gives.

3987
02:43:43,870 --> 02:43:45,530
That must be like materials and stuff.

3988
02:43:46,330 --> 02:43:47,150
Not so Deadpool.

3989
02:43:47,290 --> 02:43:48,350
Thank you for the super chat thing.

3990
02:43:48,350 --> 02:43:48,990
Thank you.

3991
02:43:48,990 --> 02:43:51,870
The quaenium could only cause a couple war crimes.

3992
02:43:52,490 --> 02:43:52,970
Okay.

3993
02:43:53,290 --> 02:43:54,610
Thank you for the super chat.

3994
02:43:54,710 --> 02:43:55,030
Thank you.

3995
02:43:55,250 --> 02:43:55,750
Thank you.

3996
02:43:55,950 --> 02:43:57,770
Beelzebub, you are so stupid!

3997
02:43:59,170 --> 02:44:00,730
Alright, we unlock that.

3998
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:02,230
Ooh!

3999
02:44:02,950 --> 02:44:04,010
More... More gear!

4000
02:44:05,410 --> 02:44:05,890
Okay.

4001
02:44:06,990 --> 02:44:07,810
Let's see.

4002
02:44:08,030 --> 02:44:09,150
Can I fast travel?

4003
02:44:10,030 --> 02:44:11,670
Oh, it's right... It's literally right here.

4004
02:44:13,710 --> 02:44:14,190
Alright.

4005
02:44:14,410 --> 02:44:15,190
Fast travel.

4006
02:44:15,370 --> 02:44:16,310
Oh, there's a camp too!

4007
02:44:16,470 --> 02:44:17,010
Wait, that's good!

4008
02:44:17,690 --> 02:44:18,650
Alright, we gotta rest.

4009
02:44:18,650 --> 02:44:21,790
For the first time, we're resting.

4010
02:44:25,210 --> 02:44:26,490
Oh my god.

4011
02:44:26,710 --> 02:44:30,450
For the first time in years, we decided to rest.

4012
02:44:32,010 --> 02:44:33,970
I wanna see if my car is better.

4013
02:44:34,110 --> 02:44:34,930
Yeah, my car is better.

4014
02:44:35,050 --> 02:44:35,650
Oh, thank god.

4015
02:44:35,870 --> 02:44:37,170
Oh, thank god.

4016
02:44:39,050 --> 02:44:39,690
Alright.

4017
02:44:40,030 --> 02:44:40,930
Motorcycle time.

4018
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:44,250
Wait, another mom showed up?

4019
02:44:44,350 --> 02:44:45,430
Not anymore.

4020
02:44:46,230 --> 02:44:48,070
Now you're orphans again.

4021
02:44:48,870 --> 02:44:51,010
Get adopted by another mom!

4022
02:44:54,350 --> 02:44:57,470
I'll make sure you'll always be orphans.

4023
02:44:57,610 --> 02:44:59,150
Oh, shit!

4024
02:44:59,530 --> 02:44:59,890
Alright.

4025
02:45:00,150 --> 02:45:00,950
That's awkward.

4026
02:45:01,030 --> 02:45:02,190
Guys, I gotta go back.

4027
02:45:03,890 --> 02:45:05,470
Guys, it's not karma.

4028
02:45:06,570 --> 02:45:08,290
But I need to go back upstairs.

4029
02:45:12,170 --> 02:45:14,730
I need to heal my bike again, guys.

4030
02:45:15,930 --> 02:45:17,110
Give me a sec.

4031
02:45:18,850 --> 02:45:20,990
Now I can fast travel!

4032
02:45:24,100 --> 02:45:24,920
Okay, maybe?

4033
02:45:25,160 --> 02:45:25,560
No.

4034
02:45:26,300 --> 02:45:27,080
Come on.

4035
02:45:27,160 --> 02:45:27,780
Get out!

4036
02:45:27,920 --> 02:45:29,000
Get out of here!

4037
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:32,140
Alright, I should be able to fast travel now.

4038
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:33,400
Still not?

4039
02:45:35,480 --> 02:45:37,740
Okay, now I should be... Okay, it doesn't matter.

4040
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,380
I'm at the camp.

4041
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:42,740
It doesn't matter.

4042
02:45:44,680 --> 02:45:45,600
Okay, rest.

4043
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:49,340
There we go.

4044
02:45:49,360 --> 02:45:49,840
See, we're okay!

4045
02:45:50,760 --> 02:45:52,340
Never punished, guys!

4046
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:54,400
Never fucking punished!

4047
02:45:56,940 --> 02:45:58,500
Okay, where do we have to go?

4048
02:45:58,740 --> 02:45:59,740
Okay, it's this way.

4049
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:00,860
What's that?

4050
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:01,820
Oh, they're like ores.

4051
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:02,800
We don't need ores.

4052
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:04,120
We have so much of them.

4053
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:05,760
Yay!

4054
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:10,000
I love not getting punished for my actions!

4055
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,480
That means I can still keep doing them!

4056
02:46:16,060 --> 02:46:16,540
Yay!

4057
02:46:17,860 --> 02:46:20,400
Does everybody in Forestland have bots or something?

4058
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:22,160
Let's get rid of these guys.

4059
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:23,620
I'm gonna punch a tiger.

4060
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:24,440
Watch this.

4061
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:30,380
It's like punching a kangaroo.

4062
02:46:31,180 --> 02:46:32,000
There you go.

4063
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:33,020
That's right.

4064
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:34,140
Oh, you wanna join in too?

4065
02:46:34,400 --> 02:46:36,700
I'm gonna punch a sucky second tiger.

4066
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:38,600
What the fuck are you guys doing here?

4067
02:46:38,660 --> 02:46:39,480
This isn't your fight!

4068
02:46:39,860 --> 02:46:41,560
I'm gonna swat you like flies!

4069
02:46:42,580 --> 02:46:43,460
Get over here!

4070
02:46:43,460 --> 02:46:43,800
Get over here!

4071
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:46,460
You wanna fucking go?

4072
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:47,740
You wanna fucking go?

4073
02:46:47,780 --> 02:46:48,740
Well, punch a bird too!

4074
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:53,320
That's fucking right.

4075
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:57,300
Alright, now... back on the bike.

4076
02:46:59,100 --> 02:47:00,800
Back on the bike I go.

4077
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:03,640
I need to reload.

4078
02:47:04,520 --> 02:47:06,360
Alright, these guys don't matter to me.

4079
02:47:07,900 --> 02:47:09,180
Gotta head over there.

4080
02:47:12,480 --> 02:47:13,820
Alright, up we go.

4081
02:47:15,400 --> 02:47:15,980
And...

4082
02:47:17,700 --> 02:47:18,520
This way.

4083
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:20,860
God!

4084
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:24,100
With all these mechs, why don't I have one that flies?

4085
02:47:24,300 --> 02:47:27,060
That's like the... literally the only thing we're missing.

4086
02:47:28,680 --> 02:47:30,520
I seriously doubt that.

4087
02:47:30,720 --> 02:47:32,700
Bots are expensive to buy and maintain.

4088
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:35,140
No one talked to you, Ral.

4089
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:37,920
Normal people couldn't hope to afford them.

4090
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:40,160
Only the army is rich.

4091
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:40,700
Wait, it heard me!

4092
02:47:41,180 --> 02:47:42,540
Wait, it heard me!

4093
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,780
Oh my god!

4094
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:49,520
The game's listening!

4095
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:52,860
Hey, Krola!

4096
02:47:53,160 --> 02:47:54,040
We came...

4097
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:58,900
Getting right to the point, I see.

4098
02:47:59,820 --> 02:48:03,600
That said, it's not like I can just hand this over to you for free.

4099
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:06,900
So how do we settle this?

4100
02:48:09,060 --> 02:48:11,640
How about... with that one-on-one...

4101
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:12,760
It becomes self-aware!

4102
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:19,360
Guys, I told you guys this is why I don't play more than three parts of a video game!

4103
02:48:19,500 --> 02:48:21,400
It starts becoming self-aware!

4104
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:23,340
...the spot that gives me the edge.

4105
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:28,900
Surely the leader of the demons wouldn't mind such a small handicap.

4106
02:48:29,220 --> 02:48:29,900
Wait, what's the handicap?

4107
02:48:30,940 --> 02:48:33,400
Actually, the leader of the demons is Lucifer.

4108
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:33,580
Fine!

4109
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:35,360
I'll take you on anywhere!

4110
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:39,040
There's a place just west of here.

4111
02:48:39,140 --> 02:48:40,380
A Rashia village.

4112
02:48:40,900 --> 02:48:42,840
We're gonna fucking storm a village?

4113
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:44,100
I'll be waiting for you right outside town.

4114
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:50,680
Bro, they're like, let's get somewhere safe for this right outside a village that all these civilians live.

4115
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:52,860
You'd better be ready too.

4116
02:48:53,020 --> 02:48:55,200
I want our duel to be legendary.

4117
02:48:58,740 --> 02:48:59,260
Alright.

4118
02:48:59,460 --> 02:49:00,600
Oh hey, there's more water!

4119
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:02,740
Okay, it's this way.

4120
02:49:03,300 --> 02:49:03,820
Look!

4121
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:05,340
Like, how is that safe?

4122
02:49:05,340 --> 02:49:06,500
We're literally in another...

4123
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:12,860
Like, I don't understand how that's safe.

4124
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:14,920
We're like in somebody else's town.

4125
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:17,800
How is that safer?

4126
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:22,300
Safe for us, not for them.

4127
02:49:22,580 --> 02:49:22,820
Yeah.

4128
02:49:23,500 --> 02:49:24,660
That's all I was thinking.

4129
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:26,120
I was like, bro, what?

4130
02:49:29,560 --> 02:49:30,160
Alright.

4131
02:49:31,060 --> 02:49:31,880
We'll take that.

4132
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:33,920
And then we'll take that.

4133
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:37,540
And down we go.

4134
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:39,480
We actually... let's just...

4135
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:40,980
I mean, we could.

4136
02:49:41,420 --> 02:49:43,040
Technically, there's loot there too.

4137
02:49:43,940 --> 02:49:46,580
The civilians are just props.

4138
02:49:47,440 --> 02:49:53,380
It's like Street Fighter or Tekken where like, you include the civilians into the fight.

4139
02:49:54,280 --> 02:49:56,260
The environment damage.

4140
02:50:00,350 --> 02:50:02,310
We gotta include the environment!

4141
02:50:06,400 --> 02:50:07,760
Okay, this way.

4142
02:50:09,420 --> 02:50:09,660
Open!

4143
02:50:13,580 --> 02:50:15,640
Okay, whoa, that's a big rocket launcher.

4144
02:50:16,180 --> 02:50:18,780
I mean, we have so much materials because I don't repair anything.

4145
02:50:28,580 --> 02:50:28,980
Nice!

4146
02:50:31,800 --> 02:50:33,420
Okay, so I assume...

4147
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:34,560
Wait, how do we get there?

4148
02:50:36,920 --> 02:50:38,480
Holy shit, they're so far!

4149
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:43,360
Wait, how the fuck do I get there?

4150
02:50:43,940 --> 02:50:45,440
I wish we do have planes.

4151
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:48,080
I can't believe Ral said we're not rich enough to have a plane.

4152
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:51,260
I mean, to be fair, he's right.

4153
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:51,860
I'm a demon.

4154
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:54,060
Like, we don't have the sense of currency.

4155
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:56,040
But still...

4156
02:50:56,040 --> 02:50:57,340
Still not fair!

4157
02:50:57,860 --> 02:50:58,420
Alright.

4158
02:51:01,240 --> 02:51:01,800
Okay.

4159
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:05,320
I found out I don't take fall damage, so...

4160
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:08,300
This stinks!

4161
02:51:14,270 --> 02:51:14,830
Nevermind.

4162
02:51:20,410 --> 02:51:21,770
Okay, okay.

4163
02:51:21,770 --> 02:51:27,050
Okay, apparently in Sand Land you don't take fall damage.

4164
02:51:27,590 --> 02:51:29,210
Okay, okay.

4165
02:51:29,290 --> 02:51:31,150
That's actually fucking bullshit.

4166
02:51:31,450 --> 02:51:34,670
In Sand Land you don't take fall damage.

4167
02:51:35,050 --> 02:51:37,430
But Forest Land is different.

4168
02:51:37,490 --> 02:51:40,590
Okay, I guess I have to do this bullshit then.

4169
02:51:41,270 --> 02:51:44,110
Let me hug the wall.

4170
02:51:44,570 --> 02:51:47,270
Alright, now it should work.

4171
02:51:48,050 --> 02:51:48,390
Whoa!

4172
02:51:48,390 --> 02:51:48,970
Whoa!

4173
02:51:50,050 --> 02:51:51,390
There we go!

4174
02:51:53,250 --> 02:51:54,010
Alright.

4175
02:51:54,830 --> 02:51:56,390
Alright, we did it.

4176
02:51:57,990 --> 02:52:01,750
We fucking did it.

4177
02:52:03,550 --> 02:52:04,310
Sorry.

4178
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:07,630
Forest Land has its own gravity apparently.

4179
02:52:08,630 --> 02:52:15,970
Apparently Forest Land has its own special gravity that doesn't exist in Sand Land.

4180
02:52:18,390 --> 02:52:19,130
Which is great.

4181
02:52:19,230 --> 02:52:20,410
That's great to know now.

4182
02:52:21,210 --> 02:52:22,410
That's great to know.

4183
02:52:24,670 --> 02:52:25,890
This is what I'm gonna do.

4184
02:52:25,970 --> 02:52:26,870
Come into the cave.

4185
02:52:27,370 --> 02:52:28,050
That's right.

4186
02:52:28,090 --> 02:52:29,450
He's too small for the cave.

4187
02:52:35,230 --> 02:52:36,370
Okay, get out!

4188
02:52:36,790 --> 02:52:37,450
Get out!

4189
02:52:37,990 --> 02:52:38,050
Whoa!

4190
02:52:39,450 --> 02:52:41,210
Get out of my cave!

4191
02:52:43,430 --> 02:52:44,290
Okay, nice.

4192
02:52:44,490 --> 02:52:44,670
Oh!

4193
02:52:44,910 --> 02:52:46,230
That dodge though!

4194
02:52:46,390 --> 02:52:48,370
That dodge was fucking sick!

4195
02:52:48,370 --> 02:52:50,990
Oh, I went the wrong way.

4196
02:52:51,570 --> 02:52:53,150
Guys, I went the wrong way.

4197
02:52:54,950 --> 02:52:56,090
Oh my god, no.

4198
02:52:56,170 --> 02:52:56,670
Not that much.

4199
02:52:58,190 --> 02:52:59,330
Elite Panther?

4200
02:52:59,650 --> 02:52:59,950
Where?

4201
02:53:02,130 --> 02:53:02,770
Guys,

4202
02:53:07,850 --> 02:53:08,150
there.

4203
02:53:11,830 --> 02:53:14,610
Alright, take two.

4204
02:53:15,130 --> 02:53:16,050
It's okay.

4205
02:53:16,210 --> 02:53:17,250
Take two.

4206
02:53:17,250 --> 02:53:19,470
I went the wrong way anyway.

4207
02:53:19,710 --> 02:53:20,910
We were supposed to go this way.

4208
02:53:21,230 --> 02:53:25,190
Alright, we were not supposed to go to any shortcuts apparently.

4209
02:53:26,930 --> 02:53:27,530
Okay.

4210
02:53:32,610 --> 02:53:37,730
The shortcut was not needed because there was no need to take a shortcut.

4211
02:53:38,250 --> 02:53:40,310
Because I went the wrong way.

4212
02:53:41,950 --> 02:53:43,490
I almost steal your loot.

4213
02:53:44,510 --> 02:53:45,110
Yay.

4214
02:53:45,430 --> 02:53:46,230
Alright, goodbye.

4215
02:53:47,790 --> 02:53:50,030
I just wanted to steal their loot.

4216
02:53:50,990 --> 02:53:51,270
Alright.

4217
02:53:53,110 --> 02:53:53,910
Take two!

4218
02:53:54,450 --> 02:53:56,990
Guys, we've only fucked up once.

4219
02:53:57,970 --> 02:53:59,710
So this is the second take.

4220
02:54:01,810 --> 02:54:03,310
Wait, it's just...

4221
02:54:04,010 --> 02:54:07,030
Okay, Hovercar does like the most damage, what I've realized.

4222
02:54:08,570 --> 02:54:09,430
Hey, LC.

4223
02:54:11,350 --> 02:54:13,810
And we get snake stuff too!

4224
02:54:15,550 --> 02:54:16,110
Okay.

4225
02:54:16,110 --> 02:54:17,490
Ooh, platinum ore!

4226
02:54:19,590 --> 02:54:20,110
Okay.

4227
02:54:20,750 --> 02:54:21,510
There we go.

4228
02:54:22,270 --> 02:54:23,710
And then- Oh, there's more ore!

4229
02:54:23,950 --> 02:54:24,510
That's good.

4230
02:54:26,650 --> 02:54:28,830
Okay, and then... more ore.

4231
02:54:29,110 --> 02:54:30,410
Oh, it was just iron ore.

4232
02:54:30,490 --> 02:54:31,310
We don't need iron ore.

4233
02:54:32,010 --> 02:54:32,530
Alright.

4234
02:54:32,950 --> 02:54:34,650
And then... swap cars!

4235
02:54:35,530 --> 02:54:36,330
Bike tab.

4236
02:54:37,870 --> 02:54:38,390
Yay!

4237
02:54:38,390 --> 02:54:39,790
Guys, we're doing it, guys!

4238
02:54:40,050 --> 02:54:40,550
Take two!

4239
02:54:41,870 --> 02:54:45,830
There was never a take three- I don't know why you guys keep saying take three.

4240
02:54:45,870 --> 02:54:46,890
Do I save his life?

4241
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:47,870
You know what?

4242
02:54:47,930 --> 02:54:49,170
I feel kind today.

4243
02:54:50,450 --> 02:54:52,270
Oh my god, they were so weak.

4244
02:54:53,150 --> 02:54:56,590
They literally are literally just... little birds.

4245
02:54:56,890 --> 02:54:57,950
Alright, give me your shit.

4246
02:54:59,310 --> 02:55:00,650
Give me your loot right now.

4247
02:55:01,690 --> 02:55:02,470
What do I get?

4248
02:55:03,770 --> 02:55:04,210
Nice.

4249
02:55:04,930 --> 02:55:05,370
Money.

4250
02:55:08,370 --> 02:55:10,450
I didn't do it out of the goodness of my heart.

4251
02:55:10,690 --> 02:55:12,450
I did it because I like money.

4252
02:55:15,290 --> 02:55:15,810
I'm gonna get it.

4253
02:55:15,810 --> 02:55:16,410
Let's see...

4254
02:55:17,130 --> 02:55:19,110
Go this way, I assume.

4255
02:55:21,250 --> 02:55:22,370
How do I get there?

4256
02:55:22,750 --> 02:55:23,650
Oh, this way.

4257
02:55:23,710 --> 02:55:24,210
There's a bridge.

4258
02:55:26,490 --> 02:55:27,010
Yay!

4259
02:55:30,010 --> 02:55:31,610
And then there's more bridges.

4260
02:55:31,670 --> 02:55:32,970
This is such a far village!

4261
02:55:33,530 --> 02:55:35,290
Why couldn't we just fight there?

4262
02:55:35,450 --> 02:55:40,830
There was like- I don't understand why he- why Elvis wouldn't just let me fight there.

4263
02:55:42,130 --> 02:55:42,650
No!

4264
02:55:42,790 --> 02:55:43,930
Supa-San, look at the-

4265
02:55:47,350 --> 02:55:49,290
I saw loot above me!

4266
02:55:49,330 --> 02:55:49,490
I saw loot above me!

4267
02:55:49,490 --> 02:55:49,890
I was like, ooh!

4268
02:55:51,110 --> 02:55:52,310
How do I get up there?

4269
02:55:52,470 --> 02:55:52,910
Okay.

4270
02:55:54,300 --> 02:55:55,210
I was like, whoa!

4271
02:55:55,630 --> 02:55:56,370
What's that?

4272
02:55:57,850 --> 02:55:59,130
Okay, I can walk up.

4273
02:55:59,250 --> 02:56:00,010
There's stairs.

4274
02:56:01,010 --> 02:56:01,590
Yay!

4275
02:56:01,590 --> 02:56:02,470
There's stairs.

4276
02:56:05,410 --> 02:56:06,610
Alright, nice.

4277
02:56:08,390 --> 02:56:08,970
Okay.

4278
02:56:10,590 --> 02:56:11,970
This better be worth it.

4279
02:56:13,270 --> 02:56:13,870
Lore.

4280
02:56:16,090 --> 02:56:17,290
Crow romance?

4281
02:56:17,350 --> 02:56:19,550
Okay, now I have to read it.

4282
02:56:23,260 --> 02:56:25,260
A book that's seen better days.

4283
02:56:25,460 --> 02:56:27,540
Found near the village suspension bridge.

4284
02:56:27,740 --> 02:56:30,000
Parts are illegible due to exposure of the elements.

4285
02:56:30,160 --> 02:56:32,200
Crow romance, volume 5.

4286
02:56:32,620 --> 02:56:38,900
The novel spins the tale of a prince crow and an impoverished girl named Off-Key falling in love.

4287
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:42,680
They made five books of this?

4288
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:45,820
It is pretty good, but the best parts all smudged.

4289
02:56:45,860 --> 02:56:47,400
Looks like the letters bled due to a ring.

4290
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:49,360
Dang, now I need to know how it ends.

4291
02:56:49,580 --> 02:56:50,740
Its owner might be nearby.

4292
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:53,420
Perhaps they'll tell you the ending if you bring- Wait, what?

4293
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:58,060
So like, is it like an actual bird?

4294
02:56:58,960 --> 02:57:02,360
And a chi- and a- and a- and a- and a woman?

4295
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:04,700
And a human?

4296
02:57:07,240 --> 02:57:10,140
And they made five books of that?

4297
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:19,500
I'm a little confused at the part where like, it literally says, crow.

4298
02:57:23,580 --> 02:57:26,800
So a bird and a woman fall in love.

4299
02:57:29,380 --> 02:57:33,760
Guys, you can't just say it's like, princess and the frog, cause the princess turned into the frog.

4300
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:35,980
So it made more sense.

4301
02:57:36,420 --> 02:57:38,280
But this one, it's like full bird.

4302
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:42,180
Is that how CrowKey was born?

4303
02:57:42,940 --> 02:57:44,540
Thank you for the super chat, Doug.

4304
02:57:44,660 --> 02:57:45,500
Thank you, thank you.

4305
02:57:45,940 --> 02:57:47,640
CrowKey is a full crow!

4306
02:57:51,020 --> 02:57:52,100
Wait, oh there he is.

4307
02:57:52,180 --> 02:57:55,060
Sorry, I was- I didn't realize that was him.

4308
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:56,120
I thought that was my crew.

4309
02:57:58,200 --> 02:57:58,580
Okay.

4310
02:57:58,860 --> 02:57:59,920
Let me check on parking.

4311
02:58:00,520 --> 02:58:01,960
I'm parallel parking right now.

4312
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:03,840
I won't stay in my bike while I talk to you.

4313
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:08,620
Alright.

4314
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:17,160
The perfect spot for our contest is up ahead.

4315
02:58:17,460 --> 02:58:18,240
Follow me.

4316
02:58:24,770 --> 02:58:27,230
Holy shit, he walks so slow.

4317
02:58:28,050 --> 02:58:29,090
So tell me.

4318
02:58:29,670 --> 02:58:31,010
What are you doing?

4319
02:58:31,030 --> 02:58:31,310
RUN!

4320
02:58:32,490 --> 02:58:33,770
Uh, dunno.

4321
02:58:34,130 --> 02:58:35,830
You wanna handle this one, thief?

4322
02:58:37,010 --> 02:58:37,850
Let's see.

4323
02:58:38,230 --> 02:58:42,450
Well, we've lived on this world long before humanity even existed.

4324
02:58:42,750 --> 02:58:45,290
Think of us as your venerable ancestors.

4325
02:58:46,570 --> 02:58:47,130
Wow.

4326
02:58:47,850 --> 02:58:50,450
So you're like the original people of our world?

4327
02:58:50,570 --> 02:58:51,650
I knew it!

4328
02:58:51,850 --> 02:58:54,010
They were the invasive species this entire time!

4329
02:58:54,770 --> 02:58:58,970
So, you can see Supreme Commander Bread and Moonie- They're Christopher Columb- Okay, I shouldn't say that.

4330
02:58:59,090 --> 02:59:01,910
They want nothing to do with this annoying conflict they're forcing on us.

4331
02:59:02,750 --> 02:59:03,830
You're not thinking of one.

4332
02:59:03,830 --> 02:59:03,850
Sorry.

4333
02:59:04,410 --> 02:59:05,670
Are you?

4334
02:59:06,510 --> 02:59:08,570
Hey, we're not monsters.

4335
02:59:08,970 --> 02:59:10,890
Leave us out of your dumb wars.

4336
02:59:11,350 --> 02:59:11,810
What?

4337
02:59:12,110 --> 02:59:15,270
Supreme Commander Bread is always telling us that demons are the best.

4338
02:59:15,270 --> 02:59:16,770
Demons are the baddest of the bad.

4339
02:59:17,590 --> 02:59:20,010
But I'm starting to think that can't be true.

4340
02:59:21,990 --> 02:59:22,550
Exactly.

4341
02:59:22,550 --> 02:59:24,510
Demons aren't the bad guys at all.

4342
02:59:25,370 --> 02:59:26,250
I agree.

4343
02:59:26,510 --> 02:59:29,370
They might have the purest hearts of anyone in this world.

4344
02:59:30,550 --> 02:59:32,630
Our hearts are pure, alright?

4345
02:59:33,110 --> 02:59:34,330
Pure evil.

4346
02:59:35,690 --> 02:59:37,770
Bro, can I walk faster?

4347
02:59:39,450 --> 02:59:40,010
RUN!

4348
02:59:45,270 --> 02:59:46,090
You're thinking, haven't you?

4349
02:59:46,250 --> 02:59:48,670
About which side is right and which is wrong?

4350
02:59:49,250 --> 02:59:51,150
It won't even let me stray the path.

4351
02:59:51,710 --> 02:59:53,650
Right is relative after all.

4352
02:59:53,790 --> 02:59:55,030
Why do I walk to the left?

4353
02:59:55,210 --> 02:59:56,590
Nope, it won't let me see that!

4354
02:59:56,750 --> 02:59:59,850
I try to walk to the left and the game forces me to walk straight.

4355
03:00:00,150 --> 03:00:03,390
After all this, you really still think Bread is in the right?

4356
03:00:05,210 --> 03:00:07,530
You're... the princess, right?

4357
03:00:08,490 --> 03:00:12,030
Under normal circumstances, I'd be at your command.

4358
03:00:13,130 --> 03:00:15,250
But these times sure as hell aren't nice.

4359
03:00:15,270 --> 03:00:17,910
I'm normal and I answer only to Supreme Commander Bread.

4360
03:00:18,790 --> 03:00:21,890
I owe him for taking us in when we had nothing to our name.

4361
03:00:22,090 --> 03:00:22,890
Wait, what?

4362
03:00:23,770 --> 03:00:24,290
Orphans?

4363
03:00:24,850 --> 03:00:26,130
Oh, he's an orphan!

4364
03:00:28,270 --> 03:00:28,790
What?!

4365
03:00:29,550 --> 03:00:33,530
To me, honor is more important than being right.

4366
03:00:34,970 --> 03:00:40,850
This is getting a little unethical because they took him into the army when they were little when they had nothing.

4367
03:00:40,970 --> 03:00:43,750
So they're orphans and like, you know...

4368
03:00:45,270 --> 03:00:46,150
I'm not sure what you're expecting.

4369
03:00:46,970 --> 03:00:49,470
All I'm saying... wait, there was loot behind me.

4370
03:00:49,510 --> 03:00:50,670
I'm gonna go back to get the loot.

4371
03:00:52,570 --> 03:00:59,390
All I'm saying is that... is that... is that they've been gaslighted into joining the army.

4372
03:01:01,210 --> 03:01:02,090
Is there loot?

4373
03:01:02,410 --> 03:01:03,510
I thought there'd be loot!

4374
03:01:06,490 --> 03:01:13,110
So like, he's been in the army... I'm not saying... I'm not saying that he might be a child soldier.

4375
03:01:13,110 --> 03:01:19,330
All I'm saying is that he said he had nowhere to go and he was young.

4376
03:01:24,510 --> 03:01:32,690
So... I'm saying that the army might need some explaining to do about this army.

4377
03:01:44,670 --> 03:01:45,630
Right here.

4378
03:01:47,590 --> 03:01:50,030
Now then, let's get started.

4379
03:01:52,350 --> 03:01:52,590
Yup.

4380
03:01:52,690 --> 03:01:54,890
You guys just let me handle this.

4381
03:01:56,090 --> 03:01:56,670
All right.

4382
03:02:00,440 --> 03:02:01,760
Wait, what?

4383
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:05,620
Where did this guy... oh, wait, I thought it was a 1v1!

4384
03:02:06,360 --> 03:02:08,840
What the fuck?!

4385
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:12,580
What the fuck kind of 1v1 is this?!

4386
03:02:14,820 --> 03:02:18,200
He fucking gets to ride a bike and I just...

4387
03:02:18,200 --> 03:02:20,020
Get rowdy here.

4388
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:21,220
Get rowdy here.

4389
03:02:21,540 --> 03:02:21,780
No!

4390
03:02:24,740 --> 03:02:25,960
Get over here!

4391
03:02:27,700 --> 03:02:31,320
Okay, he has a set... oh my god, I punched a bike.

4392
03:02:32,940 --> 03:02:34,140
That's fucking right.

4393
03:02:34,680 --> 03:02:35,940
Get over here!

4394
03:02:37,220 --> 03:02:38,820
Get your ass over here!

4395
03:02:39,020 --> 03:02:41,320
That's right, go punch a fucking bike!

4396
03:02:45,860 --> 03:02:48,360
Okay, maybe not.

4397
03:02:49,360 --> 03:02:50,840
1v1 me, you coward!

4398
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:53,660
Okay, this is bad.

4399
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:57,900
I don't... okay, it's like the bike thing all over again.

4400
03:02:58,480 --> 03:03:01,040
It's definitely like the bike thing all over again.

4401
03:03:03,320 --> 03:03:04,020
It's okay!

4402
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:05,680
I'll get there!

4403
03:03:06,800 --> 03:03:08,100
I know the pattern!

4404
03:03:09,780 --> 03:03:11,880
I know the pattern, guys!

4405
03:03:13,580 --> 03:03:16,060
Guys, I know where he's gonna go!

4406
03:03:17,460 --> 03:03:19,420
I know where he's gonna go, guys!

4407
03:03:21,220 --> 03:03:24,560
I swear to god, I know where he's gonna go!

4408
03:03:24,800 --> 03:03:25,320
No!

4409
03:03:26,660 --> 03:03:30,200
Okay, this is awkward.

4410
03:03:30,440 --> 03:03:31,600
This is actually...

4411
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:33,760
This is a little awkward, guys.

4412
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:36,980
This is... this is just a little...

4413
03:03:36,980 --> 03:03:37,860
Look, see, I knew it!

4414
03:03:37,980 --> 03:03:38,660
Oh shit!

4415
03:03:39,600 --> 03:03:43,600
Okay, I tank like...

4416
03:03:44,520 --> 03:03:46,400
I tanked a lot of that.

4417
03:03:48,520 --> 03:03:49,120
Okay.

4418
03:03:50,360 --> 03:03:52,700
Well, maybe... maybe punch guy.

4419
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:55,680
Yeah, I'm ready.

4420
03:03:55,900 --> 03:03:58,620
Wait, a 1v1 isn't like rounds.

4421
03:03:58,780 --> 03:03:59,360
Okay.

4422
03:03:59,820 --> 03:04:00,420
Guys.

4423
03:04:01,840 --> 03:04:03,020
Guys, row, please!

4424
03:04:03,720 --> 03:04:04,560
Please row!

4425
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:06,280
Yeah!

4426
03:04:06,480 --> 03:04:07,960
I punched him one time!

4427
03:04:11,500 --> 03:04:12,100
Whoa!

4428
03:04:12,480 --> 03:04:13,020
Whoa!

4429
03:04:14,700 --> 03:04:15,720
Okay, it's fine.

4430
03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:16,240
It's fine.

4431
03:04:17,220 --> 03:04:18,680
I can shoot him too!

4432
03:04:19,020 --> 03:04:19,500
See?

4433
03:04:20,120 --> 03:04:20,360
See?

4434
03:04:20,620 --> 03:04:21,600
BL, don't give up!

4435
03:04:21,920 --> 03:04:22,300
Ow!

4436
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:22,820
What?

4437
03:04:22,940 --> 03:04:24,400
Does it look like I'm giving up?

4438
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:31,560
Does it... does it look like I'm giving up?

4439
03:04:32,100 --> 03:04:33,460
I'm actually trying.

4440
03:04:33,560 --> 03:04:36,000
I don't know why she thinks I'm giving up.

4441
03:04:38,760 --> 03:04:41,680
I don't know why she thinks I'm giving up, guys.

4442
03:04:41,740 --> 03:04:42,300
I thought...

4443
03:04:42,300 --> 03:04:44,040
I thought I was trying!

4444
03:04:45,860 --> 03:04:47,300
Okay, we're just gonna...

4445
03:04:49,780 --> 03:04:50,300
Oh!

4446
03:04:50,300 --> 03:04:50,820
No!

4447
03:04:55,320 --> 03:04:57,100
What do you mean don't throw?

4448
03:04:59,500 --> 03:05:01,220
I'm trying my best!

4449
03:05:02,960 --> 03:05:04,160
There we go!

4450
03:05:04,380 --> 03:05:05,880
I got one hit in.

4451
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:07,360
Guys, look.

4452
03:05:07,400 --> 03:05:08,580
I got one hit in.

4453
03:05:08,640 --> 03:05:09,040
Guys.

4454
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:10,760
I got a hit.

4455
03:05:10,800 --> 03:05:11,720
A hit's a hit!

4456
03:05:14,620 --> 03:05:15,600
Okay, nice.

4457
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:17,660
Wait, I'll just chase after it!

4458
03:05:18,860 --> 03:05:20,320
I have... Stop!

4459
03:05:20,420 --> 03:05:21,060
I'm trying!

4460
03:05:21,340 --> 03:05:23,360
I actually am trying it!

4461
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:30,280
I know... I know it doesn't look like it, but I'm actually trying.

4462
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:34,940
BL, don't give up!

4463
03:05:34,980 --> 03:05:36,000
Please, Adam!

4464
03:05:36,040 --> 03:05:37,260
Try my best!

4465
03:05:42,680 --> 03:05:43,440
I'm not giving up!

4466
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:46,280
Okay.

4467
03:05:47,100 --> 03:05:49,820
There is so many missiles coming in.

4468
03:05:50,060 --> 03:05:50,620
No!

4469
03:05:50,820 --> 03:05:51,500
Please!

4470
03:05:51,700 --> 03:05:53,600
There's so many missiles!

4471
03:05:55,880 --> 03:05:56,260
Okay.

4472
03:05:57,560 --> 03:05:58,320
Please.

4473
03:05:59,140 --> 03:05:59,900
Please.

4474
03:06:01,420 --> 03:06:05,120
We're so... Guys, we are so close!

4475
03:06:05,120 --> 03:06:05,600
Close.

4476
03:06:06,820 --> 03:06:07,760
Guys, don't worry.

4477
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:08,580
It's working.

4478
03:06:10,200 --> 03:06:11,080
What do you mean, stop?

4479
03:06:11,160 --> 03:06:12,060
I'm trying!

4480
03:06:17,500 --> 03:06:18,780
Tank time.

4481
03:06:19,020 --> 03:06:19,940
Tank time.

4482
03:06:20,020 --> 03:06:20,740
Maybe it's...

4483
03:06:22,020 --> 03:06:22,540
It's okay.

4484
03:06:22,900 --> 03:06:23,860
Tank time.

4485
03:06:24,200 --> 03:06:25,120
It's okay.

4486
03:06:25,440 --> 03:06:27,180
Oh, it's okay, guys.

4487
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:28,460
It's tank time.

4488
03:06:28,920 --> 03:06:29,860
It's okay.

4489
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:31,800
Oh, it's not okay.

4490
03:06:32,500 --> 03:06:34,340
It's absolutely not.

4491
03:06:38,300 --> 03:06:38,900
Okay.

4492
03:06:38,900 --> 03:06:39,260
Okay.

4493
03:06:39,260 --> 03:06:39,280
Alright.

4494
03:06:40,180 --> 03:06:44,500
Okay, what I learned is that I was doing the best with the mecha.

4495
03:06:49,260 --> 03:06:50,220
Oh, see?

4496
03:06:50,400 --> 03:06:51,060
He could die!

4497
03:06:51,140 --> 03:06:52,500
I told you!

4498
03:06:54,540 --> 03:06:55,540
Oh, God.

4499
03:06:56,380 --> 03:06:57,580
Oh, God.

4500
03:06:59,540 --> 03:07:01,180
Oh, my God.

4501
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:03,720
I'm not doing so well.

4502
03:07:03,720 --> 03:07:05,360
I'm not doing so well.

4503
03:07:05,420 --> 03:07:06,900
This is the hardest fight ever.

4504
03:07:07,780 --> 03:07:09,880
This is actually the hardest one.

4505
03:07:11,980 --> 03:07:13,220
Oh, please.

4506
03:07:14,300 --> 03:07:14,940
Please!

4507
03:07:15,260 --> 03:07:15,900
Leave

4508
03:07:24,660 --> 03:07:25,160
me alone!

4509
03:07:25,300 --> 03:07:27,360
Oh, my God.

4510
03:07:27,440 --> 03:07:28,400
I'm trying!

4511
03:07:30,480 --> 03:07:32,000
Leave me alone!

4512
03:07:34,700 --> 03:07:35,340
Okay.

4513
03:07:37,560 --> 03:07:38,200
Okay.

4514
03:07:39,820 --> 03:07:41,100
Stop trying!

4515
03:07:42,480 --> 03:07:44,320
There's so many missiles!

4516
03:07:48,360 --> 03:07:49,920
Oh, my God!

4517
03:07:51,410 --> 03:07:53,300
There's so many missiles!

4518
03:07:56,720 --> 03:07:59,040
I'm trying my best!

4519
03:07:59,500 --> 03:08:00,860
Maybe it's jump bot time.

4520
03:08:02,110 --> 03:08:03,580
Maybe if I just jump...

4521
03:08:03,950 --> 03:08:05,480
Jump all my problems away.

4522
03:08:06,230 --> 03:08:06,600
Okay.

4523
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,980
That's some nice speed you've got there.

4524
03:08:10,980 --> 03:08:12,460
If I just jump from...

4525
03:08:12,460 --> 03:08:14,060
From all my problems, guys.

4526
03:08:14,860 --> 03:08:15,380
Jump!

4527
03:08:15,380 --> 03:08:16,680
Oh, my God!

4528
03:08:16,760 --> 03:08:17,480
The jump bot!

4529
03:08:17,740 --> 03:08:18,260
Okay.

4530
03:08:18,360 --> 03:08:19,960
Maybe if I ride my bike.

4531
03:08:21,240 --> 03:08:23,400
Maybe I'll just ride my bike.

4532
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:24,100
This is it.

4533
03:08:24,180 --> 03:08:25,560
Guys, I figured it out.

4534
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:28,060
I figured it out, guys.

4535
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:30,060
I figured it out.

4536
03:08:30,400 --> 03:08:31,960
I can outrun this.

4537
03:08:38,490 --> 03:08:39,530
So annoying.

4538
03:08:41,230 --> 03:08:42,690
Guys, I figured...

4539
03:08:44,690 --> 03:08:45,730
Holy shit!

4540
03:08:46,090 --> 03:08:46,610
Holy shit!

4541
03:08:46,610 --> 03:08:47,070
Holy shit!

4542
03:08:47,070 --> 03:08:48,670
I have a feeling...

4543
03:08:48,670 --> 03:08:50,370
I have...

4544
03:08:50,370 --> 03:08:53,030
Guys, I don't think I figured it out, guys.

4545
03:08:53,350 --> 03:08:55,210
I don't think I...

4546
03:08:57,250 --> 03:09:03,010
Guys, I don't think I figured it out.

4547
03:09:03,190 --> 03:09:04,210
Don't give up!

4548
03:09:09,590 --> 03:09:12,870
It's looking like a not figuring it out scenario.

4549
03:09:14,090 --> 03:09:15,410
I'm not doing this.

4550
03:09:16,390 --> 03:09:17,050
I'm not doing this.

4551
03:09:17,050 --> 03:09:19,670
I can't upgrade it.

4552
03:09:19,690 --> 03:09:20,390
It's too late.

4553
03:09:20,750 --> 03:09:23,010
I started the 1v1.

4554
03:09:23,550 --> 03:09:25,230
I'm in too deep.

4555
03:09:28,810 --> 03:09:29,890
I can't.

4556
03:09:30,110 --> 03:09:31,950
I started it.

4557
03:09:32,010 --> 03:09:34,570
Now I have to end it with my life.

4558
03:09:36,390 --> 03:09:37,570
Don't give up.

4559
03:09:37,850 --> 03:09:39,130
Please, Adam.

4560
03:09:39,130 --> 03:09:40,790
I'm trying not to.

4561
03:09:44,690 --> 03:09:46,650
I messed up it.

4562
03:09:46,650 --> 03:09:47,030
I messed up it.

4563
03:09:49,410 --> 03:09:50,170
Get ready for your funny episode.

4564
03:09:50,170 --> 03:09:50,750
Oh shit!

4565
03:09:54,750 --> 03:09:56,170
Don't give up.

4566
03:09:56,250 --> 03:09:57,970
Oh my god, Ann.

4567
03:09:58,070 --> 03:09:59,490
It's not by choice.

4568
03:10:01,490 --> 03:10:05,070
It was never by choice.

4569
03:10:06,290 --> 03:10:07,790
Holy shit.

4570
03:10:07,910 --> 03:10:09,590
Do I even have it?

4571
03:10:09,590 --> 03:10:10,210
Guys...

4572
03:10:10,210 --> 03:10:11,390
Oh no.

4573
03:10:11,470 --> 03:10:12,590
This is not good.

4574
03:10:13,030 --> 03:10:15,250
Wait, I still have one more ...

4575
03:10:15,250 --> 03:10:16,030
I'm very good.

4576
03:10:16,030 --> 03:10:16,350
I'm kidding.

4577
03:10:19,310 --> 03:10:21,190
Okay, wait, strength...

4578
03:10:21,750 --> 03:10:23,190
Temporary Brute... Oh, nice!

4579
03:10:23,430 --> 03:10:24,490
Guys, we need to wait.

4580
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:25,710
Where is the firepower?

4581
03:10:26,070 --> 03:10:28,650
Okay, we got firepower and we got armor.

4582
03:10:28,890 --> 03:10:29,670
This is it.

4583
03:10:29,750 --> 03:10:31,250
We go all in, guys.

4584
03:10:31,550 --> 03:10:33,330
We go all in.

4585
03:10:36,450 --> 03:10:37,550
Get over here!

4586
03:10:38,150 --> 03:10:39,250
Get over here!

4587
03:10:39,310 --> 03:10:39,970
Go to the lane!

4588
03:10:40,750 --> 03:10:41,270
Please!

4589
03:10:41,270 --> 03:10:41,690
No!

4590
03:10:43,190 --> 03:10:45,390
Please, I have so many upgrades right now.

4591
03:10:45,390 --> 03:10:45,770
Please!

4592
03:10:45,870 --> 03:10:47,210
Oh my God!

4593
03:10:49,970 --> 03:10:50,330
Guys!

4594
03:10:56,470 --> 03:10:58,450
Oh my God!

4595
03:11:03,630 --> 03:11:06,690
Does this hit me if I block it?

4596
03:11:08,130 --> 03:11:09,190
No, it doesn't.

4597
03:11:09,270 --> 03:11:10,570
Oh, never mind.

4598
03:11:10,670 --> 03:11:11,350
It does.

4599
03:11:15,390 --> 03:11:17,570
If I could grab, I would.

4600
03:11:19,750 --> 03:11:20,610
No, no.

4601
03:11:20,730 --> 03:11:23,910
This is like the most unfair fight ever.

4602
03:11:24,170 --> 03:11:28,630
I swear to God, this fight is actually so unfair.

4603
03:11:29,130 --> 03:11:30,910
Let's take this fight up another tier, BielsaBub.

4604
03:11:32,250 --> 03:11:32,610
Please.

4605
03:11:35,010 --> 03:11:36,330
Please leave me alone.

4606
03:11:37,390 --> 03:11:38,630
Leave me alone.

4607
03:11:39,950 --> 03:11:41,130
Lock it in, princess.

4608
03:11:42,930 --> 03:11:43,290
Alright.

4609
03:11:45,390 --> 03:11:45,850
Boom!

4610
03:11:45,850 --> 03:11:46,810
And then I block.

4611
03:11:46,990 --> 03:11:47,870
I can't block.

4612
03:11:48,070 --> 03:11:48,690
I can't block.

4613
03:11:48,890 --> 03:11:49,990
I can't block.

4614
03:11:50,210 --> 03:11:52,050
Oh my God!

4615
03:11:53,140 --> 03:11:54,190
Fuck you, Karr!

4616
03:11:57,880 --> 03:11:58,750
Holy shit.

4617
03:11:59,520 --> 03:12:01,310
Oh my God, I hate this.

4618
03:12:02,060 --> 03:12:04,650
I hate this so much.

4619
03:12:06,890 --> 03:12:09,430
Bro, this guy doesn't play fair!

4620
03:12:12,310 --> 03:12:13,170
Oh God.

4621
03:12:14,090 --> 03:12:15,030
Oh God.

4622
03:12:15,530 --> 03:12:17,310
Oh, what do you mean?

4623
03:12:17,350 --> 03:12:18,370
I haven't hit him once.

4624
03:12:18,710 --> 03:12:20,870
What do you mean, just a little more?

4625
03:12:22,750 --> 03:12:23,350
Yes!

4626
03:12:23,750 --> 03:12:24,350
Okay.

4627
03:12:24,790 --> 03:12:26,030
I take those.

4628
03:12:26,490 --> 03:12:28,410
I take those.

4629
03:12:30,290 --> 03:12:33,350
I take anything I can get at this point.

4630
03:12:34,810 --> 03:12:35,810
Oh God.

4631
03:12:36,290 --> 03:12:37,210
Oh God.

4632
03:12:37,950 --> 03:12:39,150
I can't run.

4633
03:12:40,410 --> 03:12:41,550
Guys, I can't run.

4634
03:12:43,170 --> 03:12:43,770
Oh my God.

4635
03:12:43,770 --> 03:12:44,150
Punch King!

4636
03:12:44,570 --> 03:12:45,290
No!

4637
03:12:46,690 --> 03:12:47,410
Woo!

4638
03:12:50,350 --> 03:12:51,210
Oh God.

4639
03:12:51,370 --> 03:12:52,570
Oh my God.

4640
03:12:52,590 --> 03:12:53,710
That's so many missiles.

4641
03:12:53,950 --> 03:12:55,430
Oh my God!

4642
03:12:57,230 --> 03:12:57,950
Oh!

4643
03:12:57,950 --> 03:12:59,350
Holy shit!

4644
03:13:00,930 --> 03:13:01,290
Okay.

4645
03:13:01,930 --> 03:13:02,650
Okay.

4646
03:13:03,670 --> 03:13:04,390
No!

4647
03:13:04,570 --> 03:13:05,530
He was so close!

4648
03:13:07,830 --> 03:13:08,190
Okay.

4649
03:13:08,710 --> 03:13:09,610
Get him!

4650
03:13:09,810 --> 03:13:10,590
Oh God.

4651
03:13:10,770 --> 03:13:11,710
Oh God.

4652
03:13:13,170 --> 03:13:14,830
I have to take this slow and steady.

4653
03:13:15,390 --> 03:13:17,110
Take this slow and steady.

4654
03:13:18,310 --> 03:13:18,870
Okay.

4655
03:13:19,270 --> 03:13:21,150
Oh no, he's doing that thing again.

4656
03:13:21,950 --> 03:13:23,590
He's doing that thing again.

4657
03:13:23,810 --> 03:13:25,310
Oh, he's doing that thing!

4658
03:13:26,890 --> 03:13:27,290
Oh!

4659
03:13:27,710 --> 03:13:28,270
Woo!

4660
03:13:28,550 --> 03:13:29,110
Woo!

4661
03:13:29,630 --> 03:13:30,190
Woo!

4662
03:13:30,610 --> 03:13:30,890
Woo!

4663
03:13:34,370 --> 03:13:35,490
Oh shit.

4664
03:13:36,330 --> 03:13:36,890
Punch!

4665
03:13:39,050 --> 03:13:40,090
Oh God.

4666
03:13:40,450 --> 03:13:40,750
Oh my God.

4667
03:13:41,930 --> 03:13:42,790
Oh my God.

4668
03:13:42,910 --> 03:13:43,150
Oh my God.

4669
03:13:43,150 --> 03:13:43,350
Let's just poke him.

4670
03:13:45,490 --> 03:13:46,270
Oh God.

4671
03:13:46,450 --> 03:13:47,210
Not again.

4672
03:13:47,670 --> 03:13:48,430
Not again.

4673
03:13:48,890 --> 03:13:49,750
Not again.

4674
03:13:49,870 --> 03:13:50,190
Please.

4675
03:13:51,510 --> 03:13:51,950
Please.

4676
03:13:52,310 --> 03:13:53,330
Do I still...?

4677
03:13:53,330 --> 03:13:54,610
Do I still have armor?

4678
03:13:54,950 --> 03:13:55,390
Nice!

4679
03:13:55,850 --> 03:13:56,550
I do!

4680
03:13:57,450 --> 03:13:58,110
I do!

4681
03:13:58,210 --> 03:13:59,210
Oh no, I'm overheating!

4682
03:13:59,410 --> 03:14:00,050
Oh no.

4683
03:14:00,530 --> 03:14:01,230
This is bad!

4684
03:14:03,050 --> 03:14:03,490
Okay.

4685
03:14:04,070 --> 03:14:04,690
Take this!

4686
03:14:04,890 --> 03:14:05,550
Take this!

4687
03:14:06,370 --> 03:14:06,810
No!

4688
03:14:06,870 --> 03:14:07,470
Don't take it!

4689
03:14:07,590 --> 03:14:07,910
Come on!

4690
03:14:08,090 --> 03:14:08,530
No!

4691
03:14:09,950 --> 03:14:10,830
Oh shit!

4692
03:14:11,230 --> 03:14:11,850
Oh fuck!

4693
03:14:11,850 --> 03:14:11,990
Fuck!

4694
03:14:11,990 --> 03:14:12,390
Oh fuck!

4695
03:14:12,550 --> 03:14:12,890
No!

4696
03:14:13,110 --> 03:14:14,710
Oh my god I fucked up!

4697
03:14:15,050 --> 03:14:16,490
I almost fucked up!

4698
03:14:18,190 --> 03:14:19,310
Holy fuck!

4699
03:14:20,870 --> 03:14:22,250
No I don't have nitro!

4700
03:14:22,370 --> 03:14:23,710
I don't have nitro anymore!

4701
03:14:24,350 --> 03:14:25,390
Discord nitro!

4702
03:14:28,670 --> 03:14:29,510
Oh no!

4703
03:14:30,210 --> 03:14:31,030
Oh no!

4704
03:14:31,750 --> 03:14:32,490
Oh god!

4705
03:14:32,830 --> 03:14:34,390
I have to like...

4706
03:14:35,730 --> 03:14:38,930
Make sure I have enough nitro for this.

4707
03:14:40,110 --> 03:14:40,950
Oh god!

4708
03:14:41,430 --> 03:14:43,030
Oh god!

4709
03:14:43,230 --> 03:14:44,870
Bro I'm so stressed out!

4710
03:14:45,570 --> 03:14:46,170
No!

4711
03:14:46,270 --> 03:14:46,950
I overheated!

4712
03:14:47,850 --> 03:14:48,450
No!

4713
03:14:50,530 --> 03:14:50,750

03:15:00,930 --> 03:15:04,210

No!

4739

4740
03:15:40,070 --> 03:15:42,190
Oh my god!

4752
03:16:10,710 --> 03:16:12,170

The missile spam may be a lot!

03:16:43,350 --> 03:16:45,450
How does he have so many missiles?

4765
03:16:47,590 --> 03:16:49,730

There we go.

4777
03:17:18,690 --> 03:17:22,230
It's like I might need to upgrade my tank guys.

4778
03:17:25,070 --> 03:17:30,750
Guys who would have thought not upgrading anything would end up fucking me over guys.

Yeah guys we might need to upgrade our tank!

4786
03:17:48,770 --> 03:17:51,990
We might need to start upgrading.

4787
03:17:54,330 --> 03:17:58,230
It's like I'm under leveled as hell right now.

4788
03:17:58,230 --> 03:18:00,610

Okay.

4797
03:18:23,970 --> 03:18:24,470
Jesus Christ!

03:18:24,770 --> 03:18:26,950
These missiles are so fucking fast!

4799
03:18:28,770 --> 03:18:29,450

03:20:09,530 --> 03:20:10,070
Okay.

4857
03:20:29,310 --> 03:20:30,210
Beelzebub, please!

4858
03:20:30,750 --> 03:20:31,770

4859
03:20:34,230 --> 03:20:36,190
Oh no, I've overheated again.

4861
03:20:39,150 --> 03:20:39,550

That was not worth it!

4876
03:21:10,430 --> 03:21:11,430
That was not worth it!

4877
03:21:11,430 --> 03:21:11,750

Do it!

4902
03:21:45,330 --> 03:21:45,810
Okay, nice.

03:21:55,510 --> 03:21:56,550
That's good for us.

4908
03:21:57,770 --> 03:22:00,070
Oh god, I can't even shoot my gun!

4909
03:22:02,170 --> 03:22:02,650
What?!

4910
03:22:02,650 --> 03:22:04,010
Okay, that's bullshit.

Okay, there you go.

At least you know I'm trying my best, sir.

You know I'm trying my best, guy.

4915
03:22:19,870 --> 03:22:21,990
After this, I'll level up my tank.

Never again.

4926
03:22:42,210 --> 03:22:43,390

Okay, nice.

4937

I can only do like, a little bit of poke... before.

4938
03:23:05,960 --> 03:23:08,000
THIEF, YOU SAID THAT 30 MINUTES AGO!

4939
03:23:09,140 --> 03:23:10,780

4941
03:23:17,660 --> 03:23:20,860
It doesn't feel like a little bit more anymore!

4942
03:23:23,540 --> 03:23:25,260
It doesn't feel like a little bit more anymore!

4943
03:23:25,260 --> 03:23:25,560
It doesn't feel like a little bit more anymore!

4944
03:23:26,340 --> 03:23:27,220
Oh god.

4945
03:23:27,760 --> 03:23:28,780
Oh god.

4946
03:23:29,420 --> 03:23:30,440
Oh god.

4947
03:23:33,060 --> 03:23:33,680
No!

4948
03:23:33,680 --> 03:23:35,080
No I got too cocky!

4949
03:23:35,420 --> 03:23:36,780
This always happens!

4950
03:23:38,960 --> 03:23:40,920
Whenever I get a little too cocky.

4951
03:23:41,760 --> 03:23:42,380
Okay.

4952
03:23:42,560 --> 03:23:43,440
Here we go.

4953
03:23:44,260 --> 03:23:47,040
I'm slapping him with a stick.

4954
03:23:47,940 --> 03:23:50,180
There's nothing else I can do!

4955
03:23:54,040 --> 03:23:58,360
We have to wheedle the damage very slowly!

4956
03:24:04,260 --> 03:24:09,200
If I... If I just have to, that's all I can do.

4957
03:24:10,940 --> 03:24:13,660
The stick play is all I have.

4958
03:24:16,820 --> 03:24:19,820
It's literally all I have.

4959
03:24:20,180 --> 03:24:21,240
Very slowly.

4960
03:24:21,540 --> 03:24:25,000
It's like level 1 versus level 99 right now.

4961
03:24:26,060 --> 03:24:27,040
Thief please.

4962
03:24:27,180 --> 03:24:29,380
I feel like I heard that forever.

4963
03:24:29,440 --> 03:24:30,080
Thief.

4964
03:24:31,340 --> 03:24:35,160
The more he says it, the less I believe it's a little more.

4965
03:24:38,920 --> 03:24:40,040
Oh shit!

4966
03:24:40,240 --> 03:24:40,760
Okay.

4967
03:24:41,580 --> 03:24:42,220
Okay.

4968
03:24:42,980 --> 03:24:44,240
We can't punch guys.

4969
03:24:45,180 --> 03:24:46,220
We punch!

4970
03:24:47,380 --> 03:24:48,880
Okay we can't get... No!

4971
03:24:49,120 --> 03:24:49,660
Oh god.

4972
03:24:50,180 --> 03:24:50,940
Oh god.

4973
03:24:52,030 --> 03:24:52,580
It's done!

4974
03:24:52,840 --> 03:24:54,560
Oh my god.

4975
03:24:56,080 --> 03:24:57,100
I'm back.

4976
03:24:58,020 --> 03:24:59,440
Oh please!

4977
03:25:00,280 --> 03:25:02,300
He's so close!

4978
03:25:03,160 --> 03:25:03,640
No!

4979
03:25:06,260 --> 03:25:07,900
He needs to spin!

4980
03:25:10,580 --> 03:25:11,360
Please!

4981
03:25:11,360 --> 03:25:12,520
Start spinning, Fritz!

4982
03:25:12,800 --> 03:25:13,700
Start spinning!

4983
03:25:13,900 --> 03:25:16,800
That's the only time I can do any damage!

4984
03:25:17,680 --> 03:25:19,160
Okay but not right now.

4985
03:25:21,180 --> 03:25:22,180
Oh god.

4986
03:25:22,220 --> 03:25:22,400
Oh god.

4987
03:25:22,400 --> 03:25:23,680
Not right now though but okay.

4988
03:25:25,320 --> 03:25:26,100
Oh god.

4989
03:25:26,660 --> 03:25:27,520
Oh god.

4990
03:25:27,820 --> 03:25:29,620
Oh god.

4991
03:25:29,860 --> 03:25:31,940
I didn't mean now but that's alright.

4992
03:25:32,560 --> 03:25:34,380
I wasn't prepared for the spin.

4993
03:25:34,680 --> 03:25:35,680
But that's okay.

4994
03:25:35,920 --> 03:25:37,880
Oh my god I can see the light!

4995
03:25:39,020 --> 03:25:40,880
Guys I can see the light!

4996
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:42,080
It's almost there!

4997
03:25:42,580 --> 03:25:44,360
I can see the light!

4998
03:25:44,820 --> 03:25:45,220
Wait.

4999
03:25:45,360 --> 03:25:46,300
Wait it's the time.

5000
03:25:46,540 --> 03:25:47,260
I'm gonna do it.

5001
03:25:47,260 --> 03:25:48,780
I'm gonna do it!

5002
03:25:53,560 --> 03:25:55,960
Oh thank god!

5003
03:25:58,140 --> 03:25:59,200
Oh my god.

5004
03:26:01,060 --> 03:26:03,620
Oh my god.

5005
03:26:08,080 --> 03:26:10,000
Thank you.

5006
03:26:11,100 --> 03:26:12,640
I'm so over it.

5007
03:26:14,920 --> 03:26:15,520
It's over.

5008
03:26:15,520 --> 03:26:16,600
Hey okay I'm over it.

5009
03:26:21,740 --> 03:26:22,740
It's over.

5010
03:26:27,420 --> 03:26:28,740
Off with the aquarium.

5011
03:26:32,780 --> 03:26:34,140
Oh my god it's over.

5012
03:26:37,060 --> 03:26:39,280
I could be special ops.

5013
03:26:39,460 --> 03:26:40,460
A staff officer.

5014
03:26:41,040 --> 03:26:42,620
Maybe a servant like you.

5015
03:26:43,620 --> 03:26:44,200
Ugh!

5016
03:26:46,400 --> 03:26:47,540
Because you are!

5017
03:26:47,840 --> 03:26:49,160
You have no other purpose!

5018
03:26:53,400 --> 03:26:53,980
Whoa!

5019
03:26:54,620 --> 03:26:56,540
Sliding in that quick, Elvis?

5020
03:26:58,320 --> 03:27:02,160
Princess, I don't think that's a good idea.

5021
03:27:03,600 --> 03:27:04,180
Whoa!

5022
03:27:06,020 --> 03:27:07,420
Okay, that's smooth.

5023
03:27:07,560 --> 03:27:08,060
Never mind.

5024
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:10,400
That was smooth, though.

5025
03:27:14,140 --> 03:27:17,640
Never have I seen so many mishaps.

5026
03:27:17,880 --> 03:27:19,880
Pong, thank you for the super chat!

5027
03:27:19,960 --> 03:27:20,920
Thank you, thank you!

5028
03:27:21,040 --> 03:27:25,880
This guy's very first super chat and then they're like, what the fuck is going on?

5029
03:27:28,080 --> 03:27:28,680
Damn!

5030
03:27:28,680 --> 03:27:29,760
That's so smooth.

5031
03:27:38,140 --> 03:27:39,300
Bro's got game.

5032
03:27:42,620 --> 03:27:43,040
Oh, bread.

5033
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:49,300
Also, bread's not a woman!

5034
03:27:58,140 --> 03:27:59,420
Wait, what?

5035
03:27:59,940 --> 03:28:01,860
You're not gonna join us after all that?

5036
03:28:02,220 --> 03:28:03,240
But that was so smooth!

5037
03:28:09,100 --> 03:28:09,740
Whoa!

5038
03:28:09,740 --> 03:28:10,380
Whoa!

5039
03:28:11,220 --> 03:28:12,540
General Kroa!

5040
03:28:17,160 --> 03:28:17,760
Whoa!

5041
03:28:17,760 --> 03:28:19,580
Yeah, he'll get in touch, alright.

5042
03:28:27,180 --> 03:28:29,260
Actually sliding into your DMs.

5043
03:28:36,660 --> 03:28:37,260
Yeah.

5044
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:48,060
He should just give us that car.

5045
03:28:49,120 --> 03:28:50,540
The bullshit I just said.

5046
03:28:50,560 --> 03:28:51,120
I just went through.

5047
03:28:51,200 --> 03:28:52,780
I deserve to own that car.

5048
03:29:02,800 --> 03:29:04,680
Bread is about to make a move?

5049
03:29:07,820 --> 03:29:10,360
Even when losing, he is winning.

5050
03:29:12,780 --> 03:29:13,900
Oh my god.

5051
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:14,980
Whoops, sorry.

5052
03:29:16,240 --> 03:29:17,820
I don't need a passport.

5053
03:29:17,820 --> 03:29:20,540
Alright, let's go back to...

5054
03:29:20,540 --> 03:29:22,680
Let's go back to Lango.

5055
03:29:24,940 --> 03:29:26,300
Okay, where's the garage?

5056
03:29:27,360 --> 03:29:28,740
Give me a sec.

5057
03:29:29,260 --> 03:29:29,840
I need...

5058
03:29:31,180 --> 03:29:32,120
Give me a sec.

5059
03:29:32,160 --> 03:29:32,780
This is more important.

5060
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:35,620
Give me a sec.

5061
03:29:35,740 --> 03:29:37,620
After everything I went through, give me a sec.

5062
03:29:42,040 --> 03:29:44,520
Okay, let's upgrade this.

5063
03:29:45,220 --> 03:29:46,220
And then...

5064
03:29:46,220 --> 03:29:48,380
I feel like I should upgrade the battle too.

5065
03:29:48,660 --> 03:29:49,220
Like...

5066
03:29:50,480 --> 03:29:51,040
Okay.

5067
03:29:51,380 --> 03:29:51,940
Alright.

5068
03:29:52,540 --> 03:29:53,100
Um...

5069
03:29:53,100 --> 03:29:57,420
And then after that, we gotta upgrade our parts.

5070
03:29:57,580 --> 03:29:57,860
Yeah.

5071
03:29:58,280 --> 03:29:59,400
Let's... Yeah.

5072
03:30:00,120 --> 03:30:00,680
Yeah.

5073
03:30:02,380 --> 03:30:02,940
Alright.

5074
03:30:03,400 --> 03:30:04,180
Let's see.

5075
03:30:04,280 --> 03:30:05,520
Ooh, it's purple!

5076
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:07,000
Wait, okay.

5077
03:30:07,840 --> 03:30:08,720
Primary... Whoa.

5078
03:30:09,220 --> 03:30:10,460
Wait, that shit is...

5079
03:30:10,460 --> 03:30:11,120
Wait, that's...

5080
03:30:11,120 --> 03:30:12,400
That's a lot.

5081
03:30:12,880 --> 03:30:14,060
Is that a lot of damage?

5082
03:30:14,060 --> 03:30:16,000
Okay, that's a lot of damage.

5083
03:30:16,020 --> 03:30:16,600
The cannon?

5084
03:30:18,460 --> 03:30:19,060
Wait.

5085
03:30:19,220 --> 03:30:19,840
Shot explo...

5086
03:30:19,840 --> 03:30:20,720
Enchanted...

5087
03:30:20,720 --> 03:30:21,620
Artillery.

5088
03:30:21,760 --> 03:30:22,720
Wait, should we get the...

5089
03:30:22,720 --> 03:30:23,940
I'm gonna get the cannon.

5090
03:30:24,280 --> 03:30:25,000
It's purple.

5091
03:30:25,780 --> 03:30:27,060
And then...

5092
03:30:27,780 --> 03:30:28,560
The super...

5093
03:30:28,560 --> 03:30:28,940
Guys.

5094
03:30:29,160 --> 03:30:29,640
Wow.

5095
03:30:30,020 --> 03:30:30,620
Guys.

5096
03:30:31,240 --> 03:30:31,840
Who...

5097
03:30:31,840 --> 03:30:32,320
Wow.

5098
03:30:32,440 --> 03:30:35,080
Who would've thought I was so behind when it came...

5099
03:30:39,880 --> 03:30:41,320
Oh my god.

5100
03:30:41,880 --> 03:30:43,700
There was a lot of stuff.

5101
03:30:43,700 --> 03:30:45,540
We needed to do...

5102
03:30:45,540 --> 03:30:46,320
That...

5103
03:30:47,480 --> 03:30:49,980
Guys, there was a lot of upgrades.

5104
03:30:50,260 --> 03:30:51,720
Okay, we're gonna do the battle armor.

5105
03:30:52,380 --> 03:30:53,140
Let's see.

5106
03:30:53,260 --> 03:30:53,980
Do we have anything?

5107
03:30:54,260 --> 03:30:54,780
Oh, we do.

5108
03:30:55,060 --> 03:30:55,440
Okay.

5109
03:30:56,400 --> 03:30:57,220
Armored legs.

5110
03:30:58,120 --> 03:30:59,960
Yeah, I think defense is good.

5111
03:31:00,960 --> 03:31:02,720
Wait, we have a cannon too?

5112
03:31:03,400 --> 03:31:04,480
Wait a minute.

5113
03:31:05,200 --> 03:31:06,800
That's a lot of upgrades.

5114
03:31:08,180 --> 03:31:09,300
Oh my god.

5115
03:31:10,300 --> 03:31:10,820
Alright.

5116
03:31:12,000 --> 03:31:13,320
Okay, that was...

5117
03:31:13,320 --> 03:31:17,060
That was a lot more than I expected.

5118
03:31:22,110 --> 03:31:23,040
That was...

5119
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:27,080
That was a lot bigger upgrades than I expected, guys.

5120
03:31:28,840 --> 03:31:30,120
Alright, let's see.

5121
03:31:32,300 --> 03:31:34,560
Yeah, I should've gone back to camp.

5122
03:31:35,020 --> 03:31:36,540
Is there anything upgraded here?

5123
03:31:36,880 --> 03:31:38,440
Holy shit!

5124
03:31:41,340 --> 03:31:41,960
Alright.

5125
03:31:44,380 --> 03:31:44,860
Okay.

5126
03:31:45,620 --> 03:31:47,920
There was a lot of stuff I should've been doing.

5127
03:31:49,080 --> 03:31:50,360
Should I upgrade everything?

5128
03:31:51,140 --> 03:31:55,240
Interceptor, drones, slam into enemies while engulfed in flames?

5129
03:31:55,300 --> 03:31:56,380
Okay, yeah, we need that.

5130
03:31:56,500 --> 03:31:56,720
Alright.

5131
03:32:00,060 --> 03:32:01,680
Okay, we need upgrade...

5132
03:32:02,240 --> 03:32:03,900
We gotta upgrade this guy too.

5133
03:32:06,420 --> 03:32:06,900
Uhhhh...

5134
03:32:07,400 --> 03:32:08,200
Upgrade vehicle.

5135
03:32:12,180 --> 03:32:12,660
Uhhhh...

5136
03:32:12,660 --> 03:32:13,300
Okay.

5137
03:32:13,300 --> 03:32:14,240
I can get it to 16.

5138
03:32:14,520 --> 03:32:15,340
Oh my god.

5139
03:32:16,880 --> 03:32:19,240
Okay, we don't care about this guy apparently.

5140
03:32:21,000 --> 03:32:21,960
Holy shit.

5141
03:32:22,220 --> 03:32:22,700
Wow.

5142
03:32:23,620 --> 03:32:25,500
Alright, we need croc alloy.

5143
03:32:27,880 --> 03:32:28,360
Alright!

5144
03:32:30,100 --> 03:32:31,720
I think our vehicles are pretty...

5145
03:32:31,720 --> 03:32:33,680
Oh wait, I can upgrade like parts too.

5146
03:32:33,740 --> 03:32:34,560
I forgot about that.

5147
03:32:35,760 --> 03:32:36,240
Parts.

5148
03:32:37,160 --> 03:32:37,920
Upgrade part.

5149
03:32:40,440 --> 03:32:40,920
Nevermind.

5150
03:32:40,920 --> 03:32:42,580
I need a lot of shit.

5151
03:32:44,180 --> 03:32:45,860
How about my...

5152
03:32:46,540 --> 03:32:47,380
This guy.

5153
03:32:48,860 --> 03:32:54,060
Okay, I need cobra alloy, arm scrap, crack alloy.

5154
03:32:54,560 --> 03:32:56,360
Okay, I need snakes and...

5155
03:32:56,920 --> 03:32:57,360
Alright.

5156
03:32:58,420 --> 03:33:00,340
Wait, how do I upgrade chip slots?

5157
03:33:01,940 --> 03:33:02,580
Parts.

5158
03:33:03,200 --> 03:33:04,180
Make part.

5159
03:33:07,940 --> 03:33:09,660
Wait, what the fuck?

5160
03:33:09,740 --> 03:33:10,860
I can make stuff?

5161
03:33:14,500 --> 03:33:17,140
Wait, but how do I get chip slots?

5162
03:33:21,320 --> 03:33:22,340
Oh, upgrade vehicle?

5163
03:33:28,280 --> 03:33:29,280
Oh, there you go.

5164
03:33:29,800 --> 03:33:30,600
Wait, I can't.

5165
03:33:31,580 --> 03:33:32,260
It's locked.

5166
03:33:32,460 --> 03:33:33,820
I think I need to be a level higher.

5167
03:33:36,640 --> 03:33:38,140
I need to be level higher.

5168
03:33:38,320 --> 03:33:38,660
I think.

5169
03:33:40,040 --> 03:33:41,920
Because I can't get a chip slot.

5170
03:33:46,140 --> 03:33:48,640
Because there's no other way to...

5171
03:33:48,640 --> 03:33:51,740
I need to... yeah, I need to upgrade...

5172
03:33:53,240 --> 03:33:55,860
Let me... let me do a vehicle.

5173
03:33:56,440 --> 03:33:57,160
Upgrade vehicle.

5174
03:33:57,380 --> 03:33:58,180
Can I buy it here?

5175
03:34:00,300 --> 03:34:03,440
Yeah, I have to... oh, what level do you have to beat up?

5176
03:34:03,600 --> 03:34:05,420
You can't even have more than one!

5177
03:34:05,700 --> 03:34:06,880
Oh, I don't have magnets.

5178
03:34:07,500 --> 03:34:08,680
Is it because I need magnets?

5179
03:34:09,260 --> 03:34:10,780
I need a magnet?!

5180
03:34:10,780 --> 03:34:13,020
How the fuck do I find a magnet?!

5181
03:34:15,420 --> 03:34:16,700
Do you sell magnets?

5182
03:34:19,400 --> 03:34:21,180
Oh, hey, you got... how the...

5183
03:34:21,840 --> 03:34:23,160
Do you have magnets?

5184
03:34:24,420 --> 03:34:25,840
Petit Eric, do you have magnet?

5185
03:34:27,040 --> 03:34:28,900
Okay, we gotta buy repair kit.

5186
03:34:29,280 --> 03:34:30,620
No matter what people say.

5187
03:34:31,380 --> 03:34:32,740
B-grade shipping...

5188
03:34:32,740 --> 03:34:36,300
Okay, armor up, armor up, repair kit, repair kit plus.

5189
03:34:36,380 --> 03:34:36,700
Okay.

5190
03:34:36,840 --> 03:34:38,820
This is where we need to spend our money on.

5191
03:34:38,900 --> 03:34:39,380
This is...

5192
03:34:43,000 --> 03:34:47,700
Okay, this is definitely what we need to spend our money on.

5193
03:34:51,100 --> 03:34:51,520
Hey...

5194
03:34:51,520 --> 03:34:51,730
Okay.

5195
03:34:54,480 --> 03:34:54,900
Okay.

5196
03:34:55,260 --> 03:34:56,320
Alright, there we go.

5197
03:34:56,660 --> 03:34:58,380
Alright, I don't care if I'm poor now.

5198
03:34:59,500 --> 03:35:02,420
After all of that, I realized what I need to do.

5199
03:35:04,740 --> 03:35:05,720
Alright, there we go.

5200
03:35:08,060 --> 03:35:08,900
Alright, now...

5201
03:35:09,420 --> 03:35:10,100
Wait, workshop?

5202
03:35:10,220 --> 03:35:11,100
Maybe you have magnets?

5203
03:35:11,940 --> 03:35:12,800
You have a magnet?

5204
03:35:17,060 --> 03:35:18,120
Oh, there he is!

5205
03:35:18,120 --> 03:35:18,340
What is this?

5206
03:35:19,660 --> 03:35:20,940
Oh shit!

5207
03:35:21,100 --> 03:35:22,580
Wait, I can buy so much stuff!

5208
03:35:23,060 --> 03:35:26,640
Okay, we need croc alloy and cobra alloy.

5209
03:35:27,760 --> 03:35:29,460
We can get all that.

5210
03:35:30,480 --> 03:35:32,720
And then... Oh my... guys!

5211
03:35:33,900 --> 03:35:36,900
Guys, I'm upgrading!

5212
03:35:38,040 --> 03:35:41,820
Alright, get back here.

5213
03:35:43,640 --> 03:35:47,700
Over here, everything I went through... I realized my mistake, guys.

5214
03:35:48,200 --> 03:35:50,760
Okay, this guy... Okay, croc steel.

5215
03:35:50,960 --> 03:35:52,480
Oh, I need a croc steel.

5216
03:35:54,780 --> 03:35:56,320
Quality cobra alloy?

5217
03:35:56,600 --> 03:35:58,820
My shit's not quality enough?!

5218
03:36:01,630 --> 03:36:02,540
Wait a minute!

5219
03:36:05,420 --> 03:36:07,540
Quality cobra alloy.

5220
03:36:07,620 --> 03:36:08,760
Quality gear.

5221
03:36:09,620 --> 03:36:10,480
Raptor alloy.

5222
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:11,740
Scorpion.

5223
03:36:11,820 --> 03:36:13,180
Cobra alloy.

5224
03:36:13,400 --> 03:36:14,620
Croc... Oh, there it is.

5225
03:36:15,340 --> 03:36:18,050
Wait, what's the difference between... Oh...

5226
03:36:18,380 --> 03:36:19,800
What?!

5227
03:36:19,800 --> 03:36:23,800
They're saying our desert crocodiles aren't quality enough!

5228
03:36:24,330 --> 03:36:26,680
Fucking forest lander.

5229
03:36:31,350 --> 03:36:33,180
Goddamn forest lander!

5230
03:36:33,280 --> 03:36:38,440
They think our crocodiles are not quality enough?!

5231
03:36:38,440 --> 03:36:40,850
How fucking dare they?!

5232
03:36:42,150 --> 03:36:43,910
Goddamn forest lander.

5233
03:36:47,470 --> 03:36:49,810
They think they're above us!

5234
03:36:50,190 --> 03:36:53,570
They think they're above the sad landers!

5235
03:36:54,090 --> 03:36:55,870
Actually fucked up!

5236
03:36:57,350 --> 03:36:58,110
Good.

5237
03:36:58,570 --> 03:37:00,390
Guys, I need to buy croc steel too.

5238
03:37:00,830 --> 03:37:01,830
Goddamn it!

5239
03:37:02,050 --> 03:37:03,770
B grade steel.

5240
03:37:03,890 --> 03:37:06,130
There's so many parts I need.

5241
03:37:08,750 --> 03:37:10,830
Typical forest lander!

5242
03:37:10,830 --> 03:37:14,450
They think they're so much better than us!

5243
03:37:14,690 --> 03:37:18,210
Okay, we're not upgrading our fucking bike, I guess.

5244
03:37:19,610 --> 03:37:20,450
Wait, wait.

5245
03:37:21,130 --> 03:37:22,730
No croc hot.

5246
03:37:22,930 --> 03:37:23,290
No!

5247
03:37:24,810 --> 03:37:25,610
No!

5248
03:37:26,670 --> 03:37:29,790
The bike is so sad.

5249
03:37:30,210 --> 03:37:32,030
The bike is so sad.

5250
03:37:32,850 --> 03:37:33,970
Okay, parts.

5251
03:37:34,310 --> 03:37:35,430
Upgrade parts.

5252
03:37:36,810 --> 03:37:38,130
Okay, level two.

5253
03:37:40,710 --> 03:37:41,510
And then...

5254
03:37:43,030 --> 03:37:43,830
Wait, uh...

5255
03:37:44,590 --> 03:37:45,810
Oh, I can max it out.

5256
03:37:45,990 --> 03:37:46,750
I might as well.

5257
03:37:47,090 --> 03:37:47,910
Oh, fuck it.

5258
03:37:47,950 --> 03:37:48,490
I might as well.

5259
03:37:49,090 --> 03:37:52,250
Uh, well, I mean, chip stock is like a magnet, so we're fine.

5260
03:37:54,650 --> 03:37:56,110
Wait, which one am I using?

5261
03:37:57,190 --> 03:37:57,810
Jump bot.

5262
03:37:57,990 --> 03:37:58,390
Hopper?

5263
03:37:58,430 --> 03:37:59,810
I don't even own a hopper.

5264
03:38:01,450 --> 03:38:03,590
Is the hopper better than my jump bot?

5265
03:38:04,490 --> 03:38:06,750
Oh well, we'll now figure that out.

5266
03:38:07,510 --> 03:38:07,910
Robot.

5267
03:38:07,910 --> 03:38:09,050
Robotic arm scrap.

5268
03:38:09,250 --> 03:38:11,290
Oh, I haven't been killing those, I guess.

5269
03:38:13,230 --> 03:38:13,670
Uhhhh...

5270
03:38:14,410 --> 03:38:15,490
I mean, can I upgrade that?

5271
03:38:15,710 --> 03:38:16,150
Oh, I can!

5272
03:38:16,630 --> 03:38:17,070
Nice!

5273
03:38:18,750 --> 03:38:19,870
Oh, hopper is bad?

5274
03:38:20,050 --> 03:38:20,930
Okay, that's good to know.

5275
03:38:22,270 --> 03:38:24,010
Uhhhh... I don't have a hover jet.

5276
03:38:24,810 --> 03:38:25,970
There's a hover jet?

5277
03:38:27,130 --> 03:38:27,970
I mean...

5278
03:38:27,970 --> 03:38:30,470
I need large launcher scrap.

5279
03:38:31,350 --> 03:38:32,790
Okay, I don't have that, though.

5280
03:38:33,270 --> 03:38:34,650
I can upgrade this, though.

5281
03:38:36,850 --> 03:38:37,530
Okay, nice.

5282
03:38:39,330 --> 03:38:40,090
Uhhhh...

5283
03:38:42,710 --> 03:38:43,090
Okay.

5284
03:38:43,710 --> 03:38:44,470
Alright.

5285
03:38:44,670 --> 03:38:46,470
And then... vehicle.

5286
03:38:47,010 --> 03:38:48,470
Guys, this is crazy.

5287
03:38:48,650 --> 03:38:50,410
Upgrading stuff is so crazy now.

5288
03:38:52,450 --> 03:38:54,850
Guys, oh my god.

5289
03:38:55,190 --> 03:38:56,150
I need more money!

5290
03:38:56,190 --> 03:38:56,730
Nooo!

5291
03:38:57,410 --> 03:38:59,650
I spent all my money!

5292
03:39:03,910 --> 03:39:04,670
Nooo!

5293
03:39:05,730 --> 03:39:06,110
Good.

5294
03:39:06,110 --> 03:39:06,550
Alright.

5295
03:39:06,850 --> 03:39:09,050
I think we're upgraded enough for now.

5296
03:39:10,770 --> 03:39:11,490
Lungo?

5297
03:39:11,930 --> 03:39:13,130
Keep watching.

5298
03:39:13,470 --> 03:39:14,130
Watch what?

5299
03:39:18,480 --> 03:39:23,600
At long last, King Jam has admitted the error of his ways.

5300
03:39:27,550 --> 03:39:32,410
Moreover, he has agreed to cede the throne to Mooniel.

5301
03:39:33,450 --> 03:39:34,710
To the child?

5302
03:39:35,090 --> 03:39:36,090
And this is the proof.

5303
03:39:38,510 --> 03:39:39,890
How does it look?

5304
03:39:39,890 --> 03:39:44,930
Certainly screams royal heirloom, doesn't it?

5305
03:39:46,270 --> 03:39:51,370
When King Jam entrusted me with this treasure, I had no choice but to...

5306
03:39:51,370 --> 03:39:51,710
Oh!

5307
03:39:51,710 --> 03:39:53,870
He stole this from us!

5308
03:39:55,130 --> 03:40:00,950
To his will that I replace him as ruler of forest land and defend its people!

5309
03:40:01,990 --> 03:40:03,670
Bro, what a little brat!

5310
03:40:04,130 --> 03:40:06,470
I'm gonna fucking... punt this fucker.

5311
03:40:06,650 --> 03:40:09,870
It is for us, the people of forest land.

5312
03:40:09,870 --> 03:40:12,390
That Mooniel has assumed this heavy burden.

5313
03:40:13,990 --> 03:40:19,290
From this day forth, we must accept Mooniel as our one true sovereign.

5314
03:40:20,450 --> 03:40:25,230
The coronation shall be held in the palace square immediately.

5315
03:40:31,330 --> 03:40:32,890
This isn't good.

5316
03:40:33,250 --> 03:40:35,710
He sounds like some Call of Duty kid.

5317
03:40:36,390 --> 03:40:37,970
Sounds like a squeaker!

5318
03:40:38,870 --> 03:40:40,150
Confirmed legitimacy.

5319
03:40:42,410 --> 03:40:46,330
Now they're stealing my father's position by force, just like they stole the necklace!

5320
03:40:48,090 --> 03:40:51,370
If we don't counter their narrative, they win.

5321
03:40:52,430 --> 03:40:54,950
Why not just use the radio tower like before?

5322
03:40:57,010 --> 03:41:01,290
If we contact your news office, can they help us reach out to the people directly?

5323
03:41:02,870 --> 03:41:03,390
Certainly.

5324
03:41:03,570 --> 03:41:04,030
No.

5325
03:41:04,350 --> 03:41:07,530
The media is for the homies lapdog for the last time.

5326
03:41:07,530 --> 03:41:08,290
It is propaganda!

5327
03:41:08,290 --> 03:41:10,270
They have the media!

5328
03:41:10,870 --> 03:41:11,930
They control the media!

5329
03:41:13,790 --> 03:41:18,610
But will the people even listen to a plea made through such violent measures?

5330
03:41:18,610 --> 03:41:21,790
Yeah, and from a fiend to half a fiend.

5331
03:41:22,150 --> 03:41:22,890
What if they see I'm alive?

5332
03:41:23,230 --> 03:41:24,790
I'm sure they'll pay attention.

5333
03:41:26,810 --> 03:41:28,930
I doubt they'll like hearing you, you badass.

5334
03:41:28,930 --> 03:41:30,270
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, Udo.

5335
03:41:35,520 --> 03:41:36,520
Sorry, princess.

5336
03:41:45,220 --> 03:41:46,760
What happened, chapon?

5337
03:41:46,900 --> 03:41:47,740
Yeah, what happened?

5338
03:41:47,900 --> 03:41:48,500
I'm sorry, princess.

5339
03:41:48,500 --> 03:41:51,760
It's not just a coronation at the same time!

5340
03:41:53,120 --> 03:41:55,020
They're gonna execute King Cam!

5341
03:41:55,320 --> 03:41:55,900
No!

5342
03:41:56,520 --> 03:41:58,820
Chapon, this is no time for jokes.

5343
03:42:00,400 --> 03:42:01,940
I'm not joking!

5344
03:42:02,300 --> 03:42:04,360
Rumors are spreading all over town!

5345
03:42:06,440 --> 03:42:07,920
There's just no way.

5346
03:42:09,040 --> 03:42:11,500
Surely not even bread would go that far.

5347
03:42:12,860 --> 03:42:15,040
There's no point in speculating.

5348
03:42:16,820 --> 03:42:18,420
Hortos infiltrated the art.

5349
03:42:18,460 --> 03:42:18,480
Hortos infiltrated the art.

5350
03:42:18,480 --> 03:42:20,420
The army will ask him when he returns.

5351
03:42:21,420 --> 03:42:23,440
Until then, we sit tight.

5352
03:42:24,980 --> 03:42:28,360
You mean they'll execute... my father?

5353
03:42:30,240 --> 03:42:31,080
Now, now.

5354
03:42:31,120 --> 03:42:32,500
We don't know that for sure yet.

5355
03:42:32,620 --> 03:42:34,680
Let's rest up while we wait for more information.

5356
03:42:37,620 --> 03:42:38,600
Oh no.

5357
03:42:39,180 --> 03:42:40,680
We gotta stop him!

5358
03:42:41,300 --> 03:42:43,320
Why is there like three different people?

5359
03:42:45,160 --> 03:42:47,160
Speak with... oh, here everyone.

5360
03:42:47,320 --> 03:42:48,440
Oh, we gotta make a choice.

5361
03:42:48,480 --> 03:42:50,420
Which one's the most violent choice?

5362
03:42:50,820 --> 03:42:55,280
I expect Muniel will invade Sandland as soon as he's been crowned.

5363
03:42:55,660 --> 03:42:57,160
And if he can finally achieve...

5364
03:42:57,160 --> 03:42:57,920
You need Jam with Bread!

5365
03:42:58,880 --> 03:42:59,920
...conquering Sandland.

5366
03:43:00,820 --> 03:43:04,740
Even those who disapprove of Bread's methods will side with him.

5367
03:43:05,100 --> 03:43:08,820
That is the absolute worst case scenario for us.

5368
03:43:10,760 --> 03:43:15,520
I didn't want to say this in front of Anne, but the loss of her necklace was a problem.

5369
03:43:16,080 --> 03:43:18,460
It's allowed them to make it look like King Jam.

5370
03:43:19,440 --> 03:43:22,380
Okay, I think everybody can see that.

5371
03:43:22,480 --> 03:43:24,840
I don't know if the part about the execution is...

5372
03:43:24,840 --> 03:43:27,980
Everybody sort of knows that the necklace was some air shit.

5373
03:43:28,180 --> 03:43:29,180
There's no way to keep the king alive anymore.

5374
03:43:32,700 --> 03:43:33,300
Father...

5375
03:43:33,300 --> 03:43:36,100
All because I lost that necklace.

5376
03:43:36,500 --> 03:43:37,880
Why would they want Sandland?

5377
03:43:37,960 --> 03:43:39,240
We have nothing there!

5378
03:43:39,580 --> 03:43:43,280
I wanted to leave Sandland because there was nothing there!

5379
03:43:43,980 --> 03:43:45,140
Good work, Korto.

5380
03:43:45,620 --> 03:43:46,220
So...

5381
03:43:46,220 --> 03:43:48,940
Is the rumor about the execution true?

5382
03:43:51,010 --> 03:43:51,340
Yeah.

5383
03:43:51,540 --> 03:43:52,760
We have sand at the beach!

5384
03:43:53,040 --> 03:43:54,640
The generals couldn't stop talking about it.

5385
03:43:55,040 --> 03:43:57,280
They were clearly shaken.

5386
03:43:57,780 --> 03:44:01,740
The executions were supposed to happen before the ceremony.

5387
03:44:03,780 --> 03:44:04,440
Longo...

5388
03:44:05,620 --> 03:44:06,500
Don't worry.

5389
03:44:07,920 --> 03:44:11,740
It's time for the Resistance to rescue King Jam!

5390
03:44:12,990 --> 03:44:13,320
Yeah!

5391
03:44:13,400 --> 03:44:14,020
Yeah!

5392
03:44:16,340 --> 03:44:18,320
I hate to be a downer.

5393
03:44:18,440 --> 03:44:20,160
But do we even have a strategy?

5394
03:44:20,200 --> 03:44:20,960
We don't need strategy!

5395
03:44:21,320 --> 03:44:22,260
We have a tank!

5396
03:44:22,500 --> 03:44:24,040
Only one kind of plan works well with our numbers.

5397
03:44:24,280 --> 03:44:25,540
It's back to diversion and infiltration.

5398
03:44:25,540 --> 03:44:26,180
Oh yeah, guys.

5399
03:44:26,660 --> 03:44:28,600
We're gonna get a whole bunch of them.

5400
03:44:28,660 --> 03:44:29,020
I.e.

5401
03:44:29,040 --> 03:44:29,820
five people.

5402
03:44:29,900 --> 03:44:31,260
We'll use the secret entrance...

5403
03:44:31,260 --> 03:44:32,980
...to the royal family...

5404
03:44:32,980 --> 03:44:34,260
...to reach the palace square.

5405
03:44:35,360 --> 03:44:36,300
And the diversion?

5406
03:44:36,560 --> 03:44:41,580
With the king being held hostage, any drastic moves could put his life at risk.

5407
03:44:42,260 --> 03:44:44,960
The diversion will come after the rescue...

5408
03:44:44,960 --> 03:44:48,120
...to provide the infiltration team with an escape route.

5409
03:44:49,720 --> 03:44:50,020
Ah!

5410
03:44:50,260 --> 03:44:52,120
Have you lost your minds?

5411
03:44:52,680 --> 03:44:53,460
That's it.

5412
03:44:53,660 --> 03:44:54,340
Where are you?

5413
03:44:54,340 --> 03:44:54,800
Are you gonna leave?

5414
03:44:55,180 --> 03:44:57,520
But you supported the Resistance for so long!

5415
03:44:58,540 --> 03:45:01,840
Only a total moron would run right into it.

5416
03:45:02,960 --> 03:45:04,520
Yeah, just back out now!

5417
03:45:04,720 --> 03:45:05,660
You're in too deep!

5418
03:45:05,820 --> 03:45:06,460
You have no choice.

5419
03:45:08,260 --> 03:45:08,860
Oh.

5420
03:45:09,100 --> 03:45:10,660
Well, be my guest.

5421
03:45:10,980 --> 03:45:13,080
Just don't expect us to join in.

5422
03:45:15,600 --> 03:45:16,540
Nooooooo swimmers!

5423
03:45:17,600 --> 03:45:18,340
Come back!

5424
03:45:19,360 --> 03:45:21,100
No point in trying to force them.

5425
03:45:22,200 --> 03:45:22,680
But...

5426
03:45:24,000 --> 03:45:26,040
We need you guys to swim!

5427
03:45:26,940 --> 03:45:30,240
We don't want to make anyone take part against their will.

5428
03:45:31,940 --> 03:45:34,040
Well, I guess I'll sit this one out too.

5429
03:45:34,480 --> 03:45:35,140
Wait, what the fuck?

5430
03:45:35,400 --> 03:45:37,180
Why can't I just bring my demon army?

5431
03:45:37,380 --> 03:45:37,700
No, my watch.

5432
03:45:38,360 --> 03:45:39,940
Why can't I just bring dad over?

5433
03:45:40,260 --> 03:45:43,820
Like, we have a motive and be like, bro, he killed your child.

5434
03:45:43,820 --> 03:45:45,420
I knew it.

5435
03:45:45,420 --> 03:45:47,880
Just bring the demon army and get the demon army involved.

5436
03:45:49,300 --> 03:45:53,740
We've been fighting the good fight for an entire decade now.

5437
03:45:54,880 --> 03:45:59,380
Let's show bread just how much we've learned about guerrilla tactics over these past ten years.

5438
03:45:59,380 --> 03:46:00,200
I'm gonna call my dad.

5439
03:46:02,200 --> 03:46:02,760
Yeah!

5440
03:46:04,120 --> 03:46:06,360
Me and our three people in the Resistance.

5441
03:46:07,160 --> 03:46:07,840
Let's go.

5442
03:46:08,020 --> 03:46:09,940
We'll work out the details in the field.

5443
03:46:13,670 --> 03:46:14,230
Ew.

5444
03:46:14,230 --> 03:46:15,790
Why can't I just fucking call my dad?

5445
03:46:16,070 --> 03:46:16,650
Be like, dad!

5446
03:46:17,470 --> 03:46:20,150
They killed your fucking only daughter!

5447
03:46:21,430 --> 03:46:21,910
Okay.

5448
03:46:26,350 --> 03:46:27,010
Where's this?

5449
03:46:30,940 --> 03:46:31,960
Alright, nice.

5450
03:46:34,600 --> 03:46:37,160
Sadly, our bike is not leveled up.

5451
03:46:37,480 --> 03:46:38,440
But it's okay.

5452
03:46:38,520 --> 03:46:39,620
Our bike is still fast.

5453
03:46:40,220 --> 03:46:42,080
We don't need a level up or bike.

5454
03:46:44,800 --> 03:46:45,900
Alright, I'm ready.

5455
03:46:45,900 --> 03:46:48,200
Everything is leveled up now.

5456
03:46:48,700 --> 03:46:49,760
Where's everyone else?

5457
03:46:50,100 --> 03:46:53,000
They spread out near the capital to cause a diversion.

5458
03:46:53,600 --> 03:46:56,120
I was hoping you'd assist as well.

5459
03:46:56,440 --> 03:46:59,360
I don't mind, but what about rescuing King Jam?

5460
03:47:00,260 --> 03:47:01,560
That's where I come in.

5461
03:47:02,200 --> 03:47:02,760
You?

5462
03:47:02,960 --> 03:47:04,040
On your own?

5463
03:47:04,240 --> 03:47:05,040
That's crazy!

5464
03:47:05,740 --> 03:47:06,240
Oh?

5465
03:47:06,780 --> 03:47:10,460
I'll show you just how wily this old fox can be.

5466
03:47:10,760 --> 03:47:11,540
What's he gonna do?

5467
03:47:11,880 --> 03:47:14,100
He always managed to evade me in your rebel army days.

5468
03:47:14,760 --> 03:47:15,320
Huh.

5469
03:47:15,940 --> 03:47:17,400
That's kind of impressive.

5470
03:47:18,200 --> 03:47:21,620
But Brett and Mooniel are probably waiting at the palace plaza.

5471
03:47:22,220 --> 03:47:25,140
We'll need more than speed if we want to save the king.

5472
03:47:25,640 --> 03:47:30,620
Any human who could beat Lilith will surely be a match for the prince too.

5473
03:47:31,200 --> 03:47:33,340
I still don't buy that she actually lost.

5474
03:47:33,660 --> 03:47:35,860
But if she did, Thief's right.

5475
03:47:36,380 --> 03:47:37,680
So I'm gonna go and rescue her.

5476
03:47:37,680 --> 03:47:39,320
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's still alive.

5477
03:47:39,980 --> 03:47:40,920
There's no way.

5478
03:47:41,380 --> 03:47:43,440
Just how strong this Mooniel is.

5479
03:47:43,540 --> 03:47:44,760
Mooniel's like a fucking child.

5480
03:47:44,760 --> 03:47:47,280
How could he beat up my sister?

5481
03:47:47,780 --> 03:47:48,940
Aren't we supposed to be rescuing my father?

5482
03:47:49,120 --> 03:47:50,220
I know that.

5483
03:47:50,460 --> 03:47:52,100
I'll rescue him along the way.

5484
03:47:52,520 --> 03:47:53,860
Along the way?

5485
03:47:54,200 --> 03:47:55,340
Then it's decided.

5486
03:47:55,560 --> 03:47:57,320
I'll leave the infiltration to you.

5487
03:47:58,760 --> 03:47:59,960
Much appreciated.

5488
03:48:00,360 --> 03:48:05,080
We can reach the plaza using the secret passage under that bridge.

5489
03:48:05,460 --> 03:48:06,940
There's a secret passage?

5490
03:48:07,340 --> 03:48:08,640
Then what are we waiting for?

5491
03:48:08,780 --> 03:48:09,320
Let's go!

5492
03:48:09,640 --> 03:48:09,880
Yeah!

5493
03:48:11,880 --> 03:48:13,240
Oh, this is gonna be easy.

5494
03:48:13,640 --> 03:48:14,240
Okay.

5495
03:48:15,240 --> 03:48:16,700
Wait, where's the secret passage?

5496
03:48:17,240 --> 03:48:22,180
Okay, I'll go to the capital and then get over there.

5497
03:48:23,180 --> 03:48:24,420
Where's the secret passage?

5498
03:48:24,720 --> 03:48:24,900
Is it?

5499
03:48:24,960 --> 03:48:26,220
Oh, it's under this bridge.

5500
03:48:27,580 --> 03:48:28,060
Okay.

5501
03:48:28,420 --> 03:48:29,400
Not too bad.

5502
03:48:31,260 --> 03:48:33,440
It should be like here, right?

5503
03:48:33,760 --> 03:48:34,240
Yeah!

5504
03:48:35,460 --> 03:48:36,440
I'm so smart.

5505
03:48:39,840 --> 03:48:40,760
Wait, where do I go?

5506
03:48:43,460 --> 03:48:44,220
Where the fuck am I?

5507
03:48:44,220 --> 03:48:45,120
This way?

5508
03:48:45,340 --> 03:48:49,260
It's been ten years since I last came through here.

5509
03:48:49,460 --> 03:48:50,360
There's a fucking village?

5510
03:48:51,220 --> 03:48:52,900
Next to the secret passage?

5511
03:48:53,500 --> 03:48:54,660
Not so secret.

5512
03:48:55,480 --> 03:48:57,820
I'm not using it to run away this time.

5513
03:48:59,780 --> 03:49:00,120
Huh?

5514
03:49:00,380 --> 03:49:01,560
Is that it?

5515
03:49:02,660 --> 03:49:03,240
Shhh.

5516
03:49:03,400 --> 03:49:06,360
Seems there's still some time before the coronation starts.

5517
03:49:06,560 --> 03:49:08,580
We wait here until it begins.

5518
03:49:15,570 --> 03:49:18,010
That's really nice that they're giving like six feet.

5519
03:49:18,010 --> 03:49:21,810
Wait, is that...?

5520
03:49:21,810 --> 03:49:22,430
Is that Dad?

5521
03:49:24,170 --> 03:49:26,430
Holy shit, that's a fucking guillotine.

5522
03:49:26,730 --> 03:49:27,410
A scaffold?

5523
03:49:29,630 --> 03:49:34,850
Never before has such a glorious day smiled upon forest land.

5524
03:49:36,670 --> 03:49:40,450
And yet, so too is it a day of mourning.

5525
03:49:42,070 --> 03:49:43,590
Dad with his khakis.

5526
03:49:44,850 --> 03:49:46,330
You guys wait here.

5527
03:49:46,910 --> 03:49:48,070
I'm going in alone.

5528
03:49:48,310 --> 03:49:50,410
Is being king like a white collar job?

5529
03:49:50,730 --> 03:49:51,450
Like, what is this?

5530
03:49:51,610 --> 03:49:55,450
He looks like an office man.

5531
03:49:55,610 --> 03:49:56,190
That is a righteous idea, even for you.

5532
03:49:58,570 --> 03:50:00,630
We'll get caught if we all go.

5533
03:50:01,650 --> 03:50:05,710
I just gotta sneak up to Anne's dad, grab him, and make a break for it, right?

5534
03:50:07,470 --> 03:50:08,250
Be careful.

5535
03:50:08,470 --> 03:50:10,830
If the guards see you, it's all over.

5536
03:50:11,670 --> 03:50:12,850
I know that.

5537
03:50:13,870 --> 03:50:15,210
I feel like that's not him.

5538
03:50:16,330 --> 03:50:16,830
I don't know.

5539
03:50:17,550 --> 03:50:19,870
King Jam was a good ruler.

5540
03:50:21,270 --> 03:50:29,050
But it is a sad truth that it takes only a single drop of mud to befoul even the purest water.

5541
03:50:30,650 --> 03:50:33,070
Tempted by a fiend, King Jam committed a grave crime.

5542
03:50:33,070 --> 03:50:33,430
It's okay.

5543
03:50:33,450 --> 03:50:34,470
It's cutscene stealth.

5544
03:50:34,570 --> 03:50:36,710
That means I don't have to worry, guys.

5545
03:50:37,290 --> 03:50:39,090
It's cutscene stealth, guys.

5546
03:50:39,390 --> 03:50:41,390
He must pay for his crimes.

5547
03:50:43,490 --> 03:50:44,410
Thank God.

5548
03:50:45,130 --> 03:50:46,250
For prizes.

5549
03:50:46,250 --> 03:50:47,510
I'm going to get a fire to the coronation.

5550
03:50:47,910 --> 03:50:51,850
We shall be holding the execution of King Jam.

5551
03:50:52,170 --> 03:50:55,090
I thought I gave my necklace to the child.

5552
03:50:55,550 --> 03:50:57,310
So why are we executing me?

5553
03:50:57,670 --> 03:50:59,190
Or executing the king?

5554
03:51:02,800 --> 03:51:03,440
Demon?

5555
03:51:05,540 --> 03:51:06,520
Take aim!

5556
03:51:08,120 --> 03:51:09,680
Quick, use your metallic power!

5557
03:51:10,320 --> 03:51:10,920
We gotta split!

5558
03:51:11,940 --> 03:51:12,580
Fire!

5559
03:51:17,400 --> 03:51:19,420
This isn't what we agreed on.

5560
03:51:20,460 --> 03:51:22,440
You promised you wouldn't really shoot!

5561
03:51:23,060 --> 03:51:24,300
I knew it!

5562
03:51:24,360 --> 03:51:25,340
It can't be him!

5563
03:51:25,800 --> 03:51:29,180
I was like, why is he just wearing fucking khakis and a fucking...

5564
03:51:29,820 --> 03:51:30,860
business shirt?

5565
03:51:31,100 --> 03:51:31,980
It's not my father!

5566
03:51:34,100 --> 03:51:35,920
It was a trap after all!

5567
03:51:36,120 --> 03:51:36,620
Run!

5568
03:51:38,420 --> 03:51:40,180
I knew something was off!

5569
03:51:43,920 --> 03:51:44,820
Here you go!

5570
03:51:45,100 --> 03:51:46,800
Something for you to remember me by!

5571
03:51:47,160 --> 03:51:53,580
I'm going to get you!

5572
03:51:53,580 --> 03:51:54,080
Whoa!

5573
03:51:54,580 --> 03:51:55,600
Why you little demon!

5574
03:51:56,880 --> 03:51:57,860
Don't touch me!

5575
03:51:58,180 --> 03:52:00,380
He reminds me of fucking...

5576
03:52:00,380 --> 03:52:01,760
It was like...

5577
03:52:02,980 --> 03:52:03,540
I'll...

5578
03:52:03,540 --> 03:52:04,140
I'll...

5579
03:52:04,140 --> 03:52:05,720
I'll tell my father about you!

5580
03:52:06,640 --> 03:52:11,000
I won't waste my time fighting you filthy demons again!

5581
03:52:18,130 --> 03:52:20,670
What in the world is going on here?

5582
03:52:23,110 --> 03:52:25,290
We knew we might be walking into a trap.

5583
03:52:25,490 --> 03:52:26,530
But not on this scale.

5584
03:52:26,530 --> 03:52:28,530
Is that...

5585
03:52:28,530 --> 03:52:30,970
The forest land army?

5586
03:52:31,990 --> 03:52:34,750
The resistance was supposed to distract us!

5587
03:52:34,790 --> 03:52:35,570
Hey, where's the resistance?

5588
03:52:36,810 --> 03:52:38,330
Who exactly?

5589
03:52:38,690 --> 03:52:40,010
You mean this one?

5590
03:52:40,250 --> 03:52:42,150
You mean the five people?

5591
03:52:42,390 --> 03:52:43,210
Three?

5592
03:52:45,030 --> 03:52:48,090
What a fucking distraction!

5593
03:52:49,340 --> 03:52:49,750
Wow!

5594
03:52:51,340 --> 03:52:53,790
You make me just a little more trouble!

5595
03:52:54,450 --> 03:52:56,510
An army of five!

5596
03:52:56,510 --> 03:52:57,090
Three!

5597
03:52:57,090 --> 03:52:58,090
Not so!

5598
03:53:01,410 --> 03:53:03,210
Three old people!

5599
03:53:03,470 --> 03:53:03,530
All right, for it!

5600
03:53:04,230 --> 03:53:05,710
They're gonna shoot him!

5601
03:53:05,950 --> 03:53:07,010
Let a single one get away!

5602
03:53:07,790 --> 03:53:08,930
Why are they shooting?

5603
03:53:09,190 --> 03:53:09,350
What?

5604
03:53:09,450 --> 03:53:09,710
Hello?

5605
03:53:10,030 --> 03:53:10,350
Hello?

5606
03:53:12,350 --> 03:53:13,710
Don't let him get away!

5607
03:53:18,310 --> 03:53:19,830
Now it's four!

5608
03:53:21,170 --> 03:53:23,590
What for you and you and you!

5609
03:53:25,550 --> 03:53:26,170
Great!

5610
03:53:26,170 --> 03:53:26,490
Great!

5611
03:53:26,490 --> 03:53:28,310
Now, this is our chance to escape!

5612
03:53:29,290 --> 03:53:31,590
If only they had a weapon!

5613
03:53:34,350 --> 03:53:38,750
If only they had a gun of some sort!

5614
03:53:39,910 --> 03:53:41,950
Oh my god!

5615
03:53:42,710 --> 03:53:43,990
If only!

5616
03:53:45,930 --> 03:53:46,570
Wait!

5617
03:53:47,190 --> 03:53:48,310
I can't...

5618
03:53:48,310 --> 03:53:49,410
Can't help right now!

5619
03:53:49,530 --> 03:53:51,430
What do you mean I can't bring out my tank?

5620
03:53:51,910 --> 03:53:53,270
Guys, this is unfair.

5621
03:53:53,730 --> 03:53:55,790
I actually have to use my arms.

5622
03:53:58,630 --> 03:54:04,410
I can't believe it, I did ALL OF THAT and now I have to fight?!

5623
03:54:06,470 --> 03:54:08,310
This is fucked up.

5624
03:54:09,510 --> 03:54:10,350
Where are they?

5625
03:54:11,470 --> 03:54:12,670
Oh... sorry.

5626
03:54:16,750 --> 03:54:18,550
I can't believe it.

5627
03:54:18,630 --> 03:54:19,190
What's the point?

5628
03:54:19,450 --> 03:54:24,650
I spent all my time upgrading my... my tank and had to use my arms?

5629
03:54:25,770 --> 03:54:26,810
This is bullshit.

5630
03:54:28,050 --> 03:54:29,650
This is actually bullshit.

5631
03:54:32,050 --> 03:54:33,630
This is so bullshit.

5632
03:54:44,060 --> 03:54:46,100
Wow, where did he come from?

5633
03:54:48,820 --> 03:54:50,420
Are you serious?

5634
03:54:51,560 --> 03:54:52,520
It's a stick!

5635
03:54:55,460 --> 03:54:58,580
Why is he raising his hands up as if he's gonna get shot?

5636
03:55:00,420 --> 03:55:01,840
Now, foul fiend!

5637
03:55:03,860 --> 03:55:08,340
Unless you want your friends to lose their heads, get on your knees and grovel before me!

5638
03:55:10,120 --> 03:55:12,980
If I do, will you promise to let them go unharmed?

5639
03:55:16,900 --> 03:55:17,340
Perhaps.

5640
03:55:17,340 --> 03:55:18,140
I'll consider letting you go.

5641
03:55:18,140 --> 03:55:19,560
God, what a little bitch.

5642
03:55:21,700 --> 03:55:24,500
This voice actor is really good at making us hate this character.

5643
03:55:25,640 --> 03:55:27,600
I can't read this guy's mind either.

5644
03:55:30,340 --> 03:55:31,580
What'll it be, fiend?

5645
03:55:31,740 --> 03:55:33,780
Better start begging before I run out of patience.

5646
03:55:34,260 --> 03:55:35,520
It's a stick!

5647
03:55:35,600 --> 03:55:37,080
Why are you scared?

5648
03:55:41,560 --> 03:55:42,840
What the?

5649
03:55:45,120 --> 03:55:47,960
Get it together, Beelzebub!

5650
03:55:49,800 --> 03:55:54,780
You aren't allowed to admit defeat to anyone other than us, the Swimmers!

5651
03:55:54,900 --> 03:55:56,000
Swimmers, shoot him!

5652
03:55:56,600 --> 03:55:58,420
Why did he shoot the floor?

5653
03:56:01,660 --> 03:56:05,060
He could've literally shot the Muneo kid right there.

5654
03:56:05,460 --> 03:56:06,660
This would have been over.

5655
03:56:07,040 --> 03:56:07,800
After them.

5656
03:56:07,980 --> 03:56:09,480
Do not let them escape!

5657
03:56:15,100 --> 03:56:18,000
Swimmers, you could have shot... you could have shot them.

5658
03:56:19,500 --> 03:56:21,060
That's all I'm saying.

5659
03:56:21,560 --> 03:56:27,100
He could've literally shot the Muneo kid and all of this would have been over.

5660
03:56:29,940 --> 03:56:32,960
Okay, I wasn't gonna kill anybody but you were annoying.

5661
03:56:34,880 --> 03:56:40,160
Alright, the story would have ended there, exactly.

5662
03:56:40,780 --> 03:56:42,500
How is my team doing?

5663
03:56:43,440 --> 03:56:46,160
Oh yeah, you're gonna cheer me on instead of running with me?

5664
03:56:46,260 --> 03:56:46,480
Okay.

5665
03:56:59,560 --> 03:57:00,360
Yeah.

5666
03:57:05,810 --> 03:57:07,110
What plan?

5667
03:57:15,630 --> 03:57:19,430
Yeah, our assault team of three.

5668
03:57:23,910 --> 03:57:29,070
How did this war last 10 years is a cool question.

5669
03:57:31,270 --> 03:57:34,210
Well, they seldom worked on the great General Shiva.

5670
03:57:34,510 --> 03:57:37,610
Surely you suspected something was up this time as well.

5671
03:57:39,050 --> 03:57:42,310
The possibility did occur to me and to the Prince.

5672
03:57:42,350 --> 03:57:45,930
The fact that this war has lasted 10 years surprised me, guys.

5673
03:57:46,210 --> 03:57:48,090
We sure didn't expect it to be this.

5674
03:57:48,870 --> 03:57:50,170
That was insane.

5675
03:57:51,290 --> 03:57:53,050
We almost died out there.

5676
03:57:53,110 --> 03:57:54,130
It was a stick!

5677
03:57:56,850 --> 03:57:59,370
But it was a huge success in the end.

5678
03:57:59,450 --> 03:58:00,670
Isn't that what matters?

5679
03:58:00,970 --> 03:58:05,510
You call this a huge success?

5680
03:58:07,210 --> 03:58:09,310
My father turned out to be a fake.

5681
03:58:09,710 --> 03:58:13,030
And all we managed to do was run away without getting hurt.

5682
03:58:14,010 --> 03:58:15,770
What was the point of all that?

5683
03:58:17,650 --> 03:58:19,910
Well, one good thing came out of it.

5684
03:58:20,810 --> 03:58:21,670
Wait, what?

5685
03:58:21,790 --> 03:58:22,650
What good thing?

5686
03:58:24,130 --> 03:58:27,210
Oh, they got the necklace!

5687
03:58:28,010 --> 03:58:30,090
They got the heir!

5688
03:58:30,090 --> 03:58:31,270
A fair haspik key.

5689
03:58:31,390 --> 03:58:32,810
It's a key to a ship or something.

5690
03:58:33,950 --> 03:58:35,730
I mean, it's literally key shaped.

5691
03:58:45,130 --> 03:58:46,710
He did a thing!

5692
03:58:47,170 --> 03:58:52,150
Without definitive proof of the King's abdication, they might postpone the coronation.

5693
03:58:53,250 --> 03:58:54,650
Way to go, thief!

5694
03:58:56,690 --> 03:58:57,230
Ugh!

5695
03:59:00,430 --> 03:59:01,910
Honestly, you lot.

5696
03:59:02,370 --> 03:59:04,310
It's a little too early to celebrate.

5697
03:59:06,030 --> 03:59:07,810
Mr. Thief is right.

5698
03:59:08,770 --> 03:59:13,270
We won't have resolved anything until King Jam is safe and sound.

5699
03:59:13,310 --> 03:59:14,810
We need to know where he is, though.

5700
03:59:14,890 --> 03:59:15,770
Where is he?

5701
03:59:16,070 --> 03:59:19,550
Contact Trick Camp and hurry along the preparations.

5702
03:59:20,890 --> 03:59:24,650
I tried contacting them, but they're not answering.

5703
03:59:24,930 --> 03:59:26,110
Wait, what's going on at our camp?

5704
03:59:26,390 --> 03:59:27,810
The communicator's working fine.

5705
03:59:29,270 --> 03:59:30,090
That's strange.

5706
03:59:30,710 --> 03:59:31,690
That's not good.

5707
03:59:31,890 --> 03:59:32,170
Head back.

5708
03:59:33,270 --> 03:59:34,090
Yes, sir.

5709
03:59:35,490 --> 03:59:37,410
That does sound odd.

5710
03:59:37,750 --> 03:59:38,910
We'll come to the camp soon.

5711
03:59:38,910 --> 03:59:40,690
To be fair, we brought the entire army.

5712
03:59:40,830 --> 03:59:41,710
A three.

5713
03:59:41,830 --> 03:59:42,130
Thanks.

5714
03:59:43,650 --> 03:59:45,050
To this plan.

5715
03:59:45,110 --> 03:59:46,330
So who's guarding the camp?

5716
03:59:46,610 --> 03:59:50,070
We'll visit Forestlands capital and have a look around for ourselves.

5717
03:59:51,730 --> 03:59:52,290
Yay!

5718
03:59:52,350 --> 03:59:54,190
I wanna try coconut milk!

5719
03:59:54,910 --> 03:59:56,150
You can, son.

5720
03:59:56,430 --> 03:59:57,790
As much as you want.

5721
03:59:58,370 --> 04:00:02,310
How will they be able to go to the capital since they showed their faces?

5722
04:00:02,790 --> 04:00:06,270
I assume since they showed their faces, they know what they look like now.

5723
04:00:07,190 --> 04:00:07,670
Okay.

5724
04:00:07,830 --> 04:00:08,510
Bike time.

5725
04:00:10,030 --> 04:00:10,510
Yay!

5726
04:00:11,190 --> 04:00:11,930
Oh, sorry.

5727
04:00:12,030 --> 04:00:13,250
The team of four.

5728
04:00:14,550 --> 04:00:15,550
Sorry, you're right.

5729
04:00:16,790 --> 04:00:20,410
Now that there's a team of four, everything will be okay.

5730
04:00:21,230 --> 04:00:22,450
Can I fast travel here?

5731
04:00:24,630 --> 04:00:26,750
That fast travel here, does that work?

5732
04:00:26,750 --> 04:00:27,530
Oh, yeah, it does.

5733
04:00:27,670 --> 04:00:28,130
Okay, nice.

5734
04:00:29,530 --> 04:00:30,230
Here we go.

5735
04:00:30,350 --> 04:00:30,950
Here we go.

5736
04:00:32,610 --> 04:00:33,370
This way.

5737
04:00:34,210 --> 04:00:35,090
Am I going the right way?

5738
04:00:35,190 --> 04:00:35,690
Yeah, I am.

5739
04:00:36,410 --> 04:00:36,810
Yay!

5740
04:00:38,590 --> 04:00:39,850
I still can't believe it.

5741
04:00:39,910 --> 04:00:46,430
I spent all that time upgrading my stuff and then they're like, you gotta use your arms.

5742
04:00:47,050 --> 04:00:48,270
I'm like, what the fuck?

5743
04:00:50,710 --> 04:00:53,310
You mean I gotta use my arms?

5744
04:00:54,350 --> 04:00:55,170
What's the point?

5745
04:00:58,170 --> 04:00:58,970
Probably that.

5746
04:00:59,430 --> 04:00:59,550
Uh.

5747
04:01:01,610 --> 04:01:03,230
Steven, thank you for the super chat.

5748
04:01:03,310 --> 04:01:03,590
Thank you.

5749
04:01:03,590 --> 04:01:04,050
Thank you.

5750
04:01:04,050 --> 04:01:04,510
You know what?

5751
04:01:04,910 --> 04:01:06,150
Fuck it, I need materials.

5752
04:01:06,810 --> 04:01:08,210
I need to test my new weapon.

5753
04:01:08,430 --> 04:01:10,570
Holy shit, two thousand!

5754
04:01:10,810 --> 04:01:11,210
Okay.

5755
04:01:12,290 --> 04:01:13,090
All right.

5756
04:01:13,350 --> 04:01:13,990
That was.

5757
04:01:15,590 --> 04:01:16,750
That was strong.

5758
04:01:18,430 --> 04:01:19,230
Two thousand.

5759
04:01:20,370 --> 04:01:22,030
Steven, thank you for the super chat.

5760
04:01:22,130 --> 04:01:22,490
Thank you.

5761
04:01:22,550 --> 04:01:23,270
Thank you.

5762
04:01:23,270 --> 04:01:23,530
Thank you!

5763
04:01:23,670 --> 04:01:25,130
I just got my cherry blush!

5764
04:01:25,370 --> 04:01:28,470
I'm so happy to have it and want to let you know thank you for the super chat!

5765
04:01:28,590 --> 04:01:29,450
Thank you, thank you Steven!

5766
04:01:29,650 --> 04:01:30,830
I'm so happy it arrived!

5767
04:01:31,510 --> 04:01:32,350
I'm really happy!

5768
04:01:33,390 --> 04:01:34,850
Uh, this way.

5769
04:01:35,130 --> 04:01:35,830
Where is it?

5770
04:01:36,130 --> 04:01:37,170
I think I have to go up.

5771
04:01:38,710 --> 04:01:40,270
What the fuck was that damage?

5772
04:01:40,510 --> 04:01:41,790
That's what we've waited for.

5773
04:01:44,570 --> 04:01:45,230
Wait, is it?

5774
04:01:45,510 --> 04:01:47,090
Are we supposed to head to Trigyn?

5775
04:01:48,090 --> 04:01:51,630
Wait, why do I have... Oh, I can't fast travel there.

5776
04:01:53,870 --> 04:01:55,390
I was like wondering...

5777
04:01:56,230 --> 04:01:59,370
Okay, I almost ran over.

5778
04:02:00,850 --> 04:02:02,310
I almost did it.

5779
04:02:04,090 --> 04:02:04,870
Yeah!

5780
04:02:05,310 --> 04:02:07,110
In Sand Land I could!

5781
04:02:07,630 --> 04:02:08,870
It's not fair!

5782
04:02:10,410 --> 04:02:11,530
You know what?

5783
04:02:11,850 --> 04:02:13,190
I need materials.

5784
04:02:14,000 --> 04:02:14,890
Get over here.

5785
04:02:15,170 --> 04:02:17,190
I need materials right now.

5786
04:02:17,390 --> 04:02:18,530
That's cute!

5787
04:02:23,470 --> 04:02:27,870
Oh, that's cute that you think you could survive that.

5788
04:02:29,170 --> 04:02:29,990
Alright, nice.

5789
04:02:32,910 --> 04:02:33,390
Alright.

5790
04:02:35,070 --> 04:02:37,790
Oh, there might be... materials here too.

5791
04:02:40,890 --> 04:02:41,590
Who's in here?

5792
04:02:41,710 --> 04:02:42,710
Oh, scorpions!

5793
04:02:43,730 --> 04:02:45,770
Okay, this is my level 8 bike right now.

5794
04:02:45,790 --> 04:02:46,910
You can tell it's level 8.

5795
04:02:47,830 --> 04:02:49,450
Oh, I already was here.

5796
04:02:50,630 --> 04:02:51,670
Did I get anything?

5797
04:02:52,590 --> 04:02:55,590
Uh, I get an assassin, scorpion... Okay, you know what?

5798
04:02:55,690 --> 04:02:56,750
I might need that later.

5799
04:02:57,810 --> 04:02:58,890
I might need that.

5800
04:03:00,710 --> 04:03:03,690
We need to go back to Desert Land and we want to upgrade our bike though.

5801
04:03:03,910 --> 04:03:06,150
We don't have... Wait, there's a bridge here?

5802
04:03:07,590 --> 04:03:08,030
Bridge?

5803
04:03:12,210 --> 04:03:13,350
There we go.

5804
04:03:15,410 --> 04:03:17,150
Oooh, how do I get over there?

5805
04:03:18,210 --> 04:03:19,430
How do I get over there?

5806
04:03:19,430 --> 04:03:21,870
How do I get over there?

5807
04:03:22,010 --> 04:03:22,210
Nooo!

5808
04:03:23,050 --> 04:03:23,730
Oh, that's how.

5809
04:03:24,370 --> 04:03:25,170
Okay, nice.

5810
04:03:26,130 --> 04:03:28,110
I didn't realize there was a little area here.

5811
04:03:30,870 --> 04:03:31,530
You know what?

5812
04:03:31,950 --> 04:03:32,610
Fuck it.

5813
04:03:32,970 --> 04:03:34,290
This guy looked at me wrong.

5814
04:03:35,510 --> 04:03:36,310
Jesus Christ.

5815
04:03:39,610 --> 04:03:45,490
Oh my god, that is actually overkill.

5816
04:03:50,190 --> 04:03:52,770
Oh my god.

5817
04:03:55,250 --> 04:03:55,970
That is actually overkill.

5818
04:03:55,970 --> 04:03:58,110
My tank is so OP now.

5819
04:04:00,790 --> 04:04:01,510
Alright.

5820
04:04:02,970 --> 04:04:04,370
We're almost there.

5821
04:04:04,470 --> 04:04:05,930
We're almost back to the tank.

5822
04:04:06,370 --> 04:04:08,110
Not tank, to the camp.

5823
04:04:11,350 --> 04:04:12,070
Okay.

5824
04:04:14,670 --> 04:04:15,950
Alright, that's awkward.

5825
04:04:16,490 --> 04:04:18,110
That's really awkward.

5826
04:04:20,090 --> 04:04:21,650
We're just there.

5827
04:04:21,830 --> 04:04:24,130
At least it wasn't a game over screen.

5828
04:04:25,990 --> 04:04:27,110
General E.P.

5829
04:04:27,250 --> 04:04:28,810
Oh, there he is!

5830
04:04:29,210 --> 04:04:31,090
I was like, where's General E.P.?

5831
04:04:31,090 --> 04:04:32,410
He's at the top!

5832
04:04:37,330 --> 04:04:41,110
If it isn't the fickle macho with bumbling fiend himself.

5833
04:04:42,950 --> 04:04:43,850
I'm a...

5834
04:04:46,730 --> 04:04:50,090
May you get hangnails on all your fingers and toes.

5835
04:04:52,190 --> 04:04:53,290
What the fuck?

5836
04:04:53,910 --> 04:04:55,230
Don't worry, guys.

5837
04:04:55,410 --> 04:04:58,030
I just upgraded my tank.

5838
04:04:58,970 --> 04:05:00,450
That's fucking right.

5839
04:05:01,150 --> 04:05:02,190
Wait a minute.

5840
04:05:02,510 --> 04:05:03,790
Wait a minute, guys.

5841
04:05:04,110 --> 04:05:05,490
Wait, they're jumping above.

5842
04:05:07,090 --> 04:05:07,650
Guys.

5843
04:05:08,210 --> 04:05:10,550
They're jumping over my...

5844
04:05:10,550 --> 04:05:12,370
That wasn't part of the plan.

5845
04:05:17,410 --> 04:05:20,070
Okay, that was very smart when they jumped over my...

5846
04:05:20,070 --> 04:05:20,150
They're jumping over my...

5847
04:05:20,150 --> 04:05:20,230
They jumped over it.

5848
04:05:20,450 --> 04:05:20,890
They jumped over it.

5849
04:05:21,230 --> 04:05:23,090
You're the only one left, Eppy.

5850
04:05:23,230 --> 04:05:23,930
Yeah, surrender!

5851
04:05:24,550 --> 04:05:25,930
Before you dishonor yourself further.

5852
04:05:30,540 --> 04:05:31,020
Surrender?

5853
04:05:31,340 --> 04:05:32,120
No, no.

5854
04:05:32,280 --> 04:05:33,920
It doesn't end like this.

5855
04:05:34,740 --> 04:05:37,260
I'll be back with ten times the troops.

5856
04:05:37,380 --> 04:05:39,220
So wait here, trembling in fear.

5857
04:05:40,760 --> 04:05:41,680
Gary, thank you.

5858
04:05:41,680 --> 04:05:42,220
Super chat.

5859
04:05:42,260 --> 04:05:42,540
Thank you.

5860
04:05:43,500 --> 04:05:44,440
It's a little too late.

5861
04:05:44,580 --> 04:05:45,840
Get on the bike, Beelzebub.

5862
04:05:46,080 --> 04:05:48,000
He's literally just running!

5863
04:05:49,840 --> 04:05:50,320
Bro!

5864
04:05:51,440 --> 04:05:52,280
Wait, but Lucifer, you need to go down.

5865
04:05:52,280 --> 04:05:53,980
Give me a sec, I'll...

5866
04:05:54,980 --> 04:06:02,880
Okay, okay now he's just running with his two feet How is he faster?

5867
04:06:03,160 --> 04:06:05,660
How is he 200 meters away from me already?

5868
04:06:09,660 --> 04:06:12,560
Was he 200 meters away

5869
04:06:19,550 --> 04:06:26,090
We're surrounded an ambush He's a very good runner

5870
04:06:39,040 --> 04:06:43,440
Oh, you're gonna regret that BAM!

5871
04:06:44,480 --> 04:06:49,040
That's right, and I have another take two Boom!

5872
04:06:49,520 --> 04:06:50,760
What a hit!

5873
04:06:51,460 --> 04:07:00,240
Okay, that shield has to be the strongest shield of existence That one guy survived a fucking missile Like what the fuck?

5874
04:07:00,760 --> 04:07:05,560
I'm just gonna run you over You know what?

5875
04:07:05,900 --> 04:07:17,660
I'm angry I'm gonna slowly run you over There you go Wait, you're still alive?

5876
04:07:18,780 --> 04:07:23,400
That's fucking right, that's right, you see me, I'm gonna come up That's fucking right

5877
04:07:26,420 --> 04:07:30,700
Oh I'm coming I've been waiting for you Okay,

5878
04:07:33,840 --> 04:07:39,420

5879
04:07:39,420 --> 04:07:51,980
the shield is stronger than the tank plates It should have just made the tanks build off of those shields There is nothing I hate more in the entire world We're being told what to do Damn Damn!

5880
04:07:52,680 --> 04:07:54,700
What are you, fucking 12?

5881
04:07:59,580 --> 04:08:00,940
Duck, thank you for the super chat!

5882
04:08:01,040 --> 04:08:01,900
Thank you, thank you!

5883
04:08:02,140 --> 04:08:04,340
I think that might be a war crime joke.

5884
04:08:04,380 --> 04:08:05,280
He started it!

5885
04:08:08,860 --> 04:08:11,040
I feel like a lot of wars...

5886
04:08:13,460 --> 04:08:17,200
That is like... almost like... that is like a war argument.

5887
04:08:17,500 --> 04:08:18,440
He started it.

5888
04:08:26,290 --> 04:08:27,410
Alright, there you go.

5889
04:08:29,070 --> 04:08:29,810
Nice, alright.

5890
04:08:30,030 --> 04:08:30,630
Fight time!

5891
04:08:34,190 --> 04:08:35,910
Look, it was self-defense!

5892
04:08:41,270 --> 04:08:42,710
Is this the camp?

5893
04:08:42,890 --> 04:08:43,210
Or no?

5894
04:08:44,110 --> 04:08:44,630
No.

5895
04:08:46,270 --> 04:08:48,090
Wait, I gotta destroy these guys.

5896
04:08:50,490 --> 04:08:52,290
I'm gonna punch a raptor.

5897
04:08:52,970 --> 04:08:53,770
Get over here.

5898
04:08:55,490 --> 04:08:56,130
Sorry.

5899
04:08:57,050 --> 04:08:58,370
I'll leave you.

5900
04:08:58,450 --> 04:08:59,850
I'll let you live.

5901
04:09:03,670 --> 04:09:04,810
I'll let him live.

5902
04:09:09,950 --> 04:09:11,450
Yeah, we're gonna go now!

5903
04:09:22,970 --> 04:09:23,570
Another trap!

5904
04:09:26,010 --> 04:09:27,470
How does he still have stuff?

5905
04:09:28,770 --> 04:09:29,370
What?

5906
04:09:30,630 --> 04:09:31,670
There's nobody here.

5907
04:09:32,250 --> 04:09:33,650
Is he just gonna walk away?

5908
04:09:41,340 --> 04:09:41,940
Bro!

5909
04:09:41,940 --> 04:09:44,000
He has no more reinforcements!

5910
04:09:46,000 --> 04:09:47,360
Oh, shut up!

5911
04:09:47,600 --> 04:09:49,700
And bring it so we can beat you down already!

5912
04:09:52,250 --> 04:09:54,370
You impertinent little brat!

5913
04:09:54,610 --> 04:09:55,850
He just walks away.

5914
04:09:55,850 --> 04:09:56,090
Wait.

5915
04:09:58,030 --> 04:09:59,010
Where is he going?

5916
04:09:59,150 --> 04:09:59,390
What?

5917
04:10:01,170 --> 04:10:02,810
He has his own mecha?

5918
04:10:07,350 --> 04:10:09,230
Where did he hide that?

5919
04:10:11,470 --> 04:10:12,710
That's fucking right.

5920
04:10:12,810 --> 04:10:14,850
This is what my tank is for!

5921
04:10:16,770 --> 04:10:18,470
The moment I hit it...

5922
04:10:20,350 --> 04:10:20,910
Okay.

5923
04:10:21,270 --> 04:10:22,530
This is a little awkward.

5924
04:10:22,530 --> 04:10:22,630
Wait.

5925
04:10:24,990 --> 04:10:26,130
Give me a sec.

5926
04:10:26,910 --> 04:10:27,710
Give me a sec.

5927
04:10:28,670 --> 04:10:29,570
Oh shit!

5928
04:10:30,430 --> 04:10:31,030
Oops.

5929
04:10:35,190 --> 04:10:37,370
I forgot my HP, guys.

5930
04:10:39,370 --> 04:10:39,670
Okay.

5931
04:10:39,910 --> 04:10:40,510
Alright.

5932
04:10:40,910 --> 04:10:41,490
Alright.

5933
04:10:41,550 --> 04:10:42,570
Take one!

5934
04:10:43,890 --> 04:10:44,630
This is okay.

5935
04:10:44,930 --> 04:10:48,470
This is why I got like 20 repair kits, guys.

5936
04:10:49,110 --> 04:10:49,990
It's okay.

5937
04:10:50,250 --> 04:10:51,230
I spent...

5938
04:10:52,530 --> 04:10:53,110
This is it.

5939
04:10:53,830 --> 04:10:54,490
It's okay.

5940
04:10:54,570 --> 04:10:55,210
We're fine now.

5941
04:10:55,410 --> 04:10:56,810
Now we're okay.

5942
04:10:59,210 --> 04:10:59,870
It's okay.

5943
04:10:59,950 --> 04:11:00,630
We're okay now.

5944
04:11:01,970 --> 04:11:03,050
Boost jump?

5945
04:11:07,870 --> 04:11:09,430
Where am I getting ahead to?

5946
04:11:12,040 --> 04:11:12,830
Oh shit!

5947
04:11:12,890 --> 04:11:13,910
The sky shot!

5948
04:11:15,990 --> 04:11:16,870
Look at that.

5949
04:11:16,890 --> 04:11:17,150
Oh!

5950
04:11:17,350 --> 04:11:19,130
But look at that damage though!

5951
04:11:20,250 --> 04:11:21,470
Look at that!

5952
04:11:22,530 --> 04:11:24,110
Look at that damage though!

5953
04:11:27,250 --> 04:11:28,130
Oh shit.

5954
04:11:28,230 --> 04:11:30,090
When I hit the shots though!

5955
04:11:32,890 --> 04:11:36,970
Look at the damage when the shots actually hit though!

5956
04:11:37,790 --> 04:11:38,770
Oh no.

5957
04:11:39,170 --> 04:11:40,210
Oh no.

5958
04:11:40,310 --> 04:11:41,410
Oh, they're like a lot slower.

5959
04:11:41,510 --> 04:11:42,070
Thank God.

5960
04:11:43,110 --> 04:11:43,630
Okay.

5961
04:11:44,090 --> 04:11:46,210
At least they are a lot slower though.

5962
04:11:46,430 --> 04:11:47,710
I appreciate that.

5963
04:11:49,850 --> 04:11:51,990
Guys, why didn't you tell me to upgrade sooner?

5964
04:11:52,530 --> 04:11:52,990
Haha!

5965
04:11:57,670 --> 04:11:58,350
Alright.

5966
04:12:01,430 --> 04:12:03,950
Well, this has to be the easiest fight ever.

5967
04:12:04,170 --> 04:12:05,150
I'm just gonna stand still.

5968
04:12:06,410 --> 04:12:07,090
YAY!

5969
04:12:08,630 --> 04:12:09,310
Hahaha!

5970
04:12:11,290 --> 04:12:11,970
Hahaha!

5971
04:12:12,570 --> 04:12:14,410
Why didn't you listen?

5972
04:12:14,610 --> 04:12:15,850
Because I'm streaming.

5973
04:12:16,390 --> 04:12:16,910
Hahaha!

5974
04:12:17,710 --> 04:12:21,130
You have to tell me 80 times until I see it.

5975
04:12:21,290 --> 04:12:21,470
Oh.

5976
04:12:27,940 --> 04:12:29,480
We did it!

5977
04:12:36,100 --> 04:12:37,500
Yeah,

5978
04:12:40,540 --> 04:12:44,440
where's King Jam?

5979
04:12:47,820 --> 04:12:52,600
What are we gonna do?

5980
04:13:09,100 --> 04:13:10,700
The TV?

5981
04:13:11,100 --> 04:13:11,860
Yeah.

5982
04:13:12,060 --> 04:13:13,180
What does he mean by that?

5983
04:13:18,880 --> 04:13:20,480
Wait, what?

5984
04:13:22,340 --> 04:13:24,320
What is... what?

5985
04:13:28,100 --> 04:13:29,600
He has a necklace!

5986
04:13:36,460 --> 04:13:38,820
They used their mole to make it.

5987
04:13:45,480 --> 04:13:46,540
Curse you, bread.

5988
04:13:47,900 --> 04:13:52,240
So they went ahead with the coronation, even after our attack.

5989
04:13:54,120 --> 04:13:56,180
What quote unquote attack?

5990
04:13:56,620 --> 04:13:58,200
Look at what's on Mooniel's chest.

5991
04:14:00,060 --> 04:14:01,160
It's my necklace!

5992
04:14:03,220 --> 04:14:04,680
It could be a fake.

5993
04:14:05,140 --> 04:14:09,280
I doubt it would be that hard for them to get their hands on a decent forgery.

5994
04:14:10,900 --> 04:14:11,420
No.

5995
04:14:11,420 --> 04:14:12,520
Look at the square.

5996
04:14:12,800 --> 04:14:15,200
You can't see any of the damage from Guppy's attack.

5997
04:14:16,220 --> 04:14:19,200
My guess would be that they filmed all this beforehand.

5998
04:14:19,420 --> 04:14:21,340
Oh, damn.

5999
04:14:21,340 --> 04:14:22,820
That's smart.

6000
04:14:32,780 --> 04:14:34,680
When did this happen?

6001
04:14:34,820 --> 04:14:36,540
For I am the protector of this country!

6002
04:14:39,380 --> 04:14:41,460
Are you watching, dear citizens?

6003
04:14:43,400 --> 04:14:46,680
There has been a heinous attack on the coronation.

6004
04:14:48,540 --> 04:14:53,900
The despicable resistance has joined with Sandland's royal army.

6005
04:14:54,260 --> 04:14:55,760
Yeah, who was recording that?

6006
04:14:55,800 --> 04:14:56,700
Those were some good shots.

6007
04:14:56,700 --> 04:15:01,720
Who the fuck was recording that?

6008
04:15:01,820 --> 04:15:02,880
There was no cameraman.

6009
04:15:05,720 --> 04:15:09,740
All to prevent Mooniel from ascending to the throne.

6010
04:15:11,820 --> 04:15:15,700
Thankfully, we managed to foil their evil plot.

6011
04:15:15,940 --> 04:15:19,000
But this affront will not go unpunished.

6012
04:15:19,260 --> 04:15:23,340
Oh, so like, why is this like one screenshot FPS splicing right there?

6013
04:15:23,340 --> 04:15:27,180
I'm afraid that our brave soldiers and I managed to band together and try to outweigh this battle.

6014
04:15:27,180 --> 04:15:28,540
Wait, this was pre-recorded!

6015
04:15:28,540 --> 04:15:32,400
They realized this was gonna happen before the attack was coming.

6016
04:15:35,320 --> 04:15:39,200
I'm afraid that many of our countrymen gave their lives in the battle.

6017
04:15:41,500 --> 04:15:44,540
This was an unprovoked attack by Sandland!

6018
04:15:44,880 --> 04:15:46,100
Yeah, they planned all of this.

6019
04:15:46,160 --> 04:15:47,280
They filmed all of this in advance.

6020
04:15:47,660 --> 04:15:49,040
Like, even that part.

6021
04:15:49,240 --> 04:15:52,060
As your camp, I cannot give them the chance to commit further atrocities!

6022
04:15:53,420 --> 04:15:55,820
For the sake of those lives lost.

6023
04:15:56,420 --> 04:15:58,620
For our great patriots.

6024
04:16:00,320 --> 04:16:03,820
It is for them that I hereby declare war against Sandland!

6025
04:16:03,820 --> 04:16:04,580
Oh my god, no!

6026
04:16:05,580 --> 04:16:07,300
They have nothing!

6027
04:16:09,780 --> 04:16:12,060
They clearly just got water!

6028
04:16:14,240 --> 04:16:14,920
I

6029
04:16:19,270 --> 04:16:22,730
hate to admit it, but it looks like we've been had.

6030
04:16:23,550 --> 04:16:24,230
Oh.

6031
04:16:26,410 --> 04:16:26,990
It's over.

6032
04:16:27,590 --> 04:16:32,210
The forest land army is nearing the border as we speak.

6033
04:16:33,290 --> 04:16:33,850
What?

6034
04:16:33,850 --> 04:16:36,150
We've gotta let General Array know right now.

6035
04:16:36,670 --> 04:16:39,830
But we can't contact him unless we go back to Sandland.

6036
04:16:39,850 --> 04:16:39,950
No!

6037
04:16:41,150 --> 04:16:42,550
What are we waiting for?

6038
04:16:42,690 --> 04:16:46,450
I only get to be in forest land for one stream?

6039
04:16:50,910 --> 04:16:54,990
What do you mean I have to go back to Sandland?

6040
04:16:56,410 --> 04:16:57,830
I'm waiting for you.

6041
04:16:57,830 --> 04:17:03,290
I won't let them get hurt.

6042
04:17:03,750 --> 04:17:07,030
I'm sure your father would say the same thing.

6043
04:17:07,750 --> 04:17:09,370
Back to the sand.

6044
04:17:09,670 --> 04:17:11,730
To Sandland 2.

6045
04:17:11,750 --> 04:17:13,350
No more forest land.

6046
04:17:13,710 --> 04:17:13,770
Okay.

6047
04:17:14,870 --> 04:17:21,030
I literally just... I only got to experience forest land for one stream!

6048
04:17:21,330 --> 04:17:23,410
That is so fucked up!

6049
04:17:25,150 --> 04:17:25,950
What's up?

6050
04:17:26,410 --> 04:17:26,850
I'm so scared!

6051
04:17:28,990 --> 04:17:30,110
Holy shit!

6052
04:17:30,210 --> 04:17:32,550
How do I get back to Sandland?

6053
04:17:32,770 --> 04:17:33,750
Oh my god.

6054
04:17:33,950 --> 04:17:35,390
I'll just fast travel.

6055
04:17:36,210 --> 04:17:37,330
This is Rao.

6056
04:17:37,470 --> 04:17:37,970
General Array.

6057
04:17:37,970 --> 04:17:39,490
Back to Sandland I go.

6058
04:17:40,410 --> 04:17:41,430
This is Array.

6059
04:17:43,730 --> 04:17:45,970
I have urgent news from forest land.

6060
04:17:46,190 --> 04:17:46,850
Can we meet?

6061
04:17:47,630 --> 04:17:50,710
If this is about the declaration of war, I'm well aware.

6062
04:17:51,670 --> 04:17:54,470
We're busy preparing, so I'm stuck in the royal capital.

6063
04:17:55,330 --> 04:17:55,890
Understood.

6064
04:17:55,890 --> 04:17:57,890
And we'll head to the capital ourselves.

6065
04:17:58,730 --> 04:17:59,810
Much appreciated.

6066
04:18:00,030 --> 04:18:01,650
Until then, over and out.

6067
04:18:03,130 --> 04:18:03,730
Alright.

6068
04:18:04,570 --> 04:18:07,730
I think... I think this is a good time to call it.

6069
04:18:10,790 --> 04:18:16,770
I think... this is a good time... this is a good time to call it.

6070
04:18:16,850 --> 04:18:21,550
We left forest land and now we're back in Sandland.

6071
04:18:21,830 --> 04:18:24,390
I can't believe it, guys.

6072
04:18:24,390 --> 04:18:25,870
I can't...

6073
04:18:26,160 --> 04:18:31,910
We did all of that and now we're back to Sand...

6074
04:18:33,150 --> 04:18:38,310
It's like... we're back in Sand...

6075
04:18:38,310 --> 04:18:39,690
Stop it!

6076
04:18:40,070 --> 04:18:45,990
I only got to experience it for one stream!

6077
04:18:49,220 --> 04:18:52,210
How can they do this to me?

6078
04:18:53,250 --> 04:18:57,130
I just wanted to enjoy Sandland!

6079
04:18:57,770 --> 04:19:00,470
I want to enjoy forest land!

6080
04:19:01,330 --> 04:19:03,130
Cannot escape the Sand...

6081
04:19:03,130 --> 04:19:03,310
Alright.

6082
04:19:03,470 --> 04:19:04,570
I wonder if like...

6083
04:19:04,570 --> 04:19:05,870
Okay, I'm gonna check real fast.

6084
04:19:06,150 --> 04:19:08,530
Sand... land... no commentary.

6085
04:19:09,070 --> 04:19:12,730
I'm gonna check how much we actually have off of Sandland.

6086
04:19:12,890 --> 04:19:15,230
Because I feel like we're almost... we're close to it.

6087
04:19:15,430 --> 04:19:17,750
I think we are close to the ending.

6088
04:19:18,150 --> 04:19:18,770
Alright.

6089
04:19:19,010 --> 04:19:20,410
Where's the sand part?

6090
04:19:20,410 --> 04:19:22,730
Wait, we're actually pretty close!

6091
04:19:24,010 --> 04:19:25,330
Wait, is this it?

6092
04:19:26,030 --> 04:19:26,710
Yeah.

6093
04:19:26,810 --> 04:19:28,050
We have...

6094
04:19:30,150 --> 04:19:32,090
Technically four more hours.

6095
04:19:32,170 --> 04:19:34,590
Four more hours on...

6096
04:19:34,590 --> 04:19:37,230
Are you fucking kidding me?

6097
04:19:37,290 --> 04:19:38,950
I played like two hours...

6098
04:19:43,930 --> 04:19:45,050
Okay, alright.

6099
04:19:45,670 --> 04:19:47,810
Yeah, I think next week would be the last...

6100
04:19:47,810 --> 04:19:51,210
Next week would be the last section...

6101
04:19:51,210 --> 04:19:53,650
Of the... the Sandland.

6102
04:19:53,730 --> 04:19:54,390
I'm pretty sure.

6103
04:19:54,510 --> 04:19:55,250
Because there's like...

6104
04:19:55,250 --> 04:19:57,170
Four more hours left...

6105
04:19:57,170 --> 04:19:58,330
Wait, actually no.

6106
04:19:58,490 --> 04:19:59,930
13, 14, 15, 16, 17...

6107
04:19:59,930 --> 04:20:01,010
Four more hours left?

6108
04:20:01,170 --> 04:20:02,150
So that's just like...

6109
04:20:02,150 --> 04:20:03,930
I can enjoy this the next week.

6110
04:20:04,230 --> 04:20:05,090
Oh my god.

6111
04:20:05,150 --> 04:20:08,390
Next week would be the last final part of Sandland!

6112
04:20:09,050 --> 04:20:10,950
We'll have no more sand!

6113
04:20:11,990 --> 04:20:13,350
This has to be...

6114
04:20:14,010 --> 04:20:14,490
Definitely...

6115
04:20:14,490 --> 04:20:15,330
The...

6116
04:20:15,910 --> 04:20:17,610
The longest game...

6117
04:20:17,610 --> 04:20:17,950
Well, no.

6118
04:20:18,090 --> 04:20:19,190
Because I played Demon's Souls.

6119
04:20:19,450 --> 04:20:20,790
So like that was the longest...

6120
04:20:20,790 --> 04:20:22,070
Demon's Souls and Bloodborne.

6121
04:20:22,310 --> 04:20:24,350
That was the longest games I've ever played.

6122
04:20:24,590 --> 04:20:25,150
But like...

6123
04:20:25,830 --> 04:20:26,370
But yeah!

6124
04:20:26,610 --> 04:20:28,010
I mean it's been fun so far.

6125
04:20:28,150 --> 04:20:28,850
And then we get to...

6126
04:20:28,850 --> 04:20:31,290
We had a little fun time talking about...

6127
04:20:31,710 --> 04:20:33,710
At the start, talking about like...

6128
04:20:33,710 --> 04:20:35,290
Life updates and everything.

6129
04:20:36,130 --> 04:20:36,490
And...

6130
04:20:36,490 --> 04:20:37,110
Whoa!

6131
04:20:37,250 --> 04:20:37,930
I'm really tired.

6132
04:20:38,750 --> 04:20:40,970
But I always have a great time hanging out with you guys.

6133
04:20:41,030 --> 04:20:41,910
With you dragoons.

6134
04:20:42,010 --> 04:20:43,110
It always is a great time.

6135
04:20:43,190 --> 04:20:44,310
You know, to hang out with you guys.

6136
04:20:44,370 --> 04:20:45,810
And I hope you guys enjoyed...

6137
04:20:47,770 --> 04:20:49,630
Hope you guys enjoyed...

6138
04:20:50,190 --> 04:20:51,190
Sandland so far.

6139
04:20:51,370 --> 04:20:54,550
Next week would be the final part of Sandland.

6140
04:20:55,350 --> 04:20:57,210
So we have that left.

6141
04:20:57,550 --> 04:20:58,190
But also...

6142
04:20:58,190 --> 04:21:00,690
Regarding the tournament that's on Saturday.

6143
04:21:00,990 --> 04:21:01,510
Oh yeah.

6144
04:21:01,590 --> 04:21:02,670
I wrote in the community post.

6145
04:21:02,870 --> 04:21:04,510
For those who don't read the community post.

6146
04:21:04,750 --> 04:21:05,330
You're like...

6147
04:21:05,330 --> 04:21:06,190
Oh my god, Doki.

6148
04:21:06,250 --> 04:21:08,230
Why are you joining a tournament right before...

6149
04:21:08,230 --> 04:21:10,490
Your new skinsuit reveal?

6150
04:21:10,710 --> 04:21:12,110
Well, it's because...

6151
04:21:13,090 --> 04:21:14,510
RPR invited me to it.

6152
04:21:15,350 --> 04:21:16,990
And then I said like...

6153
04:21:16,990 --> 04:21:17,210
Oh yeah.

6154
04:21:17,310 --> 04:21:18,110
I didn't say why.

6155
04:21:18,110 --> 04:21:19,450
Because I didn't reveal my...

6156
04:21:19,450 --> 04:21:21,450
The skinsuit stuff yet.

6157
04:21:21,570 --> 04:21:22,790
So then I told him like...

6158
04:21:22,790 --> 04:21:23,090
Oh yeah.

6159
04:21:23,210 --> 04:21:23,950
I don't know.

6160
04:21:24,010 --> 04:21:25,490
Because 5pm is my...

6161
04:21:25,490 --> 04:21:26,730
It's a special stream that I have to do.

6162
04:21:26,830 --> 04:21:27,370
At 5pm.

6163
04:21:27,570 --> 04:21:28,330
So then he was like...

6164
04:21:28,330 --> 04:21:29,330
Alright, let me ask the organizer.

6165
04:21:29,650 --> 04:21:31,450
And then the organizer contacted me.

6166
04:21:31,730 --> 04:21:32,750
Because I think like...

6167
04:21:32,750 --> 04:21:34,530
The organizer wanted me as a captain.

6168
04:21:34,750 --> 04:21:35,510
For his tournament.

6169
04:21:35,810 --> 04:21:36,650
So like...

6170
04:21:36,650 --> 04:21:38,490
He contacted me about it.

6171
04:21:38,690 --> 04:21:40,170
And then I was just like...

6172
04:21:40,170 --> 04:21:40,650
Oh yeah.

6173
04:21:40,810 --> 04:21:41,990
Like RPR...

6174
04:21:41,990 --> 04:21:43,070
Like told me...

6175
04:21:43,070 --> 04:21:43,370
Yeah.

6176
04:21:43,410 --> 04:21:43,910
I was like...

6177
04:21:43,910 --> 04:21:45,790
RPR told me and...

6178
04:21:45,790 --> 04:21:46,330
Um...

6179
04:21:46,330 --> 04:21:47,630
Like I'm gonna be on his team.

6180
04:21:48,130 --> 04:21:48,450
And...

6181
04:21:48,450 --> 04:21:49,190
But then I was like...

6182
04:21:49,190 --> 04:21:49,770
Yeah...

6183
04:21:49,770 --> 04:21:50,210
Um...

6184
04:21:50,770 --> 04:21:51,890
I don't know if I can do it.

6185
04:21:51,970 --> 04:21:52,710
Because like...

6186
04:21:52,710 --> 04:21:54,550
It's on the same day as my skinsuit reveal.

6187
04:21:55,250 --> 04:21:55,570
Uh...

6188
04:21:55,570 --> 04:21:55,990
And then...

6189
04:21:55,990 --> 04:21:56,670
So then he was like...

6190
04:21:56,670 --> 04:21:58,090
I'll change the time of the tournament.

6191
04:21:58,250 --> 04:21:58,470
Like...

6192
04:21:58,470 --> 04:21:59,130
Is this time better?

6193
04:21:59,330 --> 04:21:59,810
I was like...

6194
04:21:59,810 --> 04:22:00,390
Oh I won't...

6195
04:22:00,390 --> 04:22:01,610
I don't want it like after...

6196
04:22:01,610 --> 04:22:03,150
I don't really want it after my skinsuit reveal.

6197
04:22:03,270 --> 04:22:03,970
Because I don't want to feel rushed.

6198
04:22:04,190 --> 04:22:05,070
To do a skinsuit reveal.

6199
04:22:05,170 --> 04:22:05,530
And he's like...

6200
04:22:05,530 --> 04:22:05,870
Okay.

6201
04:22:05,930 --> 04:22:07,230
I'll do it before your reveal.

6202
04:22:07,610 --> 04:22:07,930
Like...

6203
04:22:07,930 --> 04:22:08,610
Is this time better?

6204
04:22:08,770 --> 04:22:09,630
And then I felt bad.

6205
04:22:09,750 --> 04:22:10,170
Because like...

6206
04:22:10,170 --> 04:22:10,850
He was like...

6207
04:22:10,850 --> 04:22:11,850
I'm changing...

6208
04:22:11,850 --> 04:22:13,130
Like he was changing the time.

6209
04:22:14,730 --> 04:22:15,250
So...

6210
04:22:15,250 --> 04:22:16,750
So I was just like...

6211
04:22:16,750 --> 04:22:17,110
Okay.

6212
04:22:17,190 --> 04:22:17,950
I'll join.

6213
04:22:20,030 --> 04:22:20,910
Because they were...

6214
04:22:20,910 --> 04:22:21,550
Because like...

6215
04:22:21,550 --> 04:22:24,610
They were willing to change the time for it like two times.

6216
04:22:25,030 --> 04:22:25,550
So...

6217
04:22:25,550 --> 04:22:26,450
So they were like...

6218
04:22:26,450 --> 04:22:26,710
Okay.

6219
04:22:26,770 --> 04:22:27,990
So then that's why I said yes.

6220
04:22:28,450 --> 04:22:28,970
Because...

6221
04:22:28,970 --> 04:22:29,550
Uh...

6222
04:22:29,550 --> 04:22:31,590
They changed the time of the tournament for me.

6223
04:22:31,850 --> 04:22:33,450
Even though it's literally like...

6224
04:22:33,450 --> 04:22:33,990
Yesterday.

6225
04:22:34,190 --> 04:22:35,110
Literally yesterday.

6226
04:22:35,430 --> 04:22:36,570
Because I was like...

6227
04:22:36,570 --> 04:22:37,290
I don't know.

6228
04:22:37,370 --> 04:22:38,510
I have to...

6229
04:22:38,510 --> 04:22:41,570
They changed it yesterday.

6230
04:22:41,610 --> 04:22:41,830
Because I was like...

6231
04:22:41,850 --> 04:22:42,090
It's not like they changed the time for me.

6232
04:22:42,290 --> 04:22:43,210
So I felt like...

6233
04:22:43,210 --> 04:22:44,810
It was so last minute of a change.

6234
04:22:45,070 --> 04:22:45,430
Yeah.

6235
04:22:45,450 --> 04:22:46,990
They're working around my schedule.

6236
04:22:47,290 --> 04:22:48,030
So I was like...

6237
04:22:48,030 --> 04:22:48,170
Yeah.

6238
04:22:48,290 --> 04:22:48,610
Yeah.

6239
04:22:48,730 --> 04:22:49,570
I can do it.

6240
04:22:49,670 --> 04:22:50,210
As long as...

6241
04:22:50,210 --> 04:22:52,070
As long as it's before the reveal.

6242
04:22:52,270 --> 04:22:52,790
It's fine.

6243
04:22:54,070 --> 04:22:55,030
So apparently...

6244
04:22:55,030 --> 04:22:55,730
We don't know who...

6245
04:22:55,730 --> 04:22:58,790
Apparently it's like a new third-person shooter game.

6246
04:22:59,050 --> 04:22:59,610
With like...

6247
04:22:59,610 --> 04:23:00,790
Anime waifus.

6248
04:23:01,330 --> 04:23:01,810
And...

6249
04:23:01,810 --> 04:23:03,070
The betas coming...

6250
04:23:03,070 --> 04:23:05,090
It's like a beta launch tournament or something.

6251
04:23:05,410 --> 04:23:07,070
So I don't know who else is invited.

6252
04:23:07,330 --> 04:23:08,450
But RPR told me...

6253
04:23:08,450 --> 04:23:10,450
At the moment my team is...

6254
04:23:10,450 --> 04:23:13,450
So, it's me, RPR, Surefour, and RaffleGator.

6255
04:23:15,310 --> 04:23:19,390
We don't know who our fifth is because he's still looking for a fifth at the moment.

6256
04:23:19,530 --> 04:23:22,750
He was like, I'm gonna be recruiting a team that's gonna win it all!

6257
04:23:23,090 --> 04:23:24,030
Which I don't know.

6258
04:23:24,110 --> 04:23:25,570
I don't know who else is participating.

6259
04:23:26,110 --> 04:23:26,810
But like...

6260
04:23:27,330 --> 04:23:29,170
I mean, Surefour's playing on it.

6261
04:23:29,270 --> 04:23:31,670
So like... and he's like a natural gifted aimer.

6262
04:23:32,050 --> 04:23:32,490
So...

6263
04:23:33,930 --> 04:23:37,610
So, if anything fails, we have Surefour.

6264
04:23:40,450 --> 04:23:40,870
But yeah!

6265
04:23:41,030 --> 04:23:42,190
I don't know who our fifth is.

6266
04:23:42,350 --> 04:23:45,150
I just found out who our four other players are.

6267
04:23:45,870 --> 04:23:46,550
But yeah!

6268
04:23:46,630 --> 04:23:50,690
Anyway, I have a lot of work to do today!

6269
04:23:52,950 --> 04:23:56,630
So, I am going to call it here, everybody.

6270
04:23:57,650 --> 04:24:03,390
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing!

6271
04:24:03,630 --> 04:24:06,890
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it!

6272
04:24:07,050 --> 04:24:08,010
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

6273
04:24:08,450 --> 04:24:09,190
Bye, guys!

6274
04:24:10,590 --> 04:24:10,910
Bye!

6275
04:24:13,450 --> 04:24:14,490
Where's my... Oh, there it is!

6276
04:24:14,570 --> 04:24:14,850
Bye!

6277
04:24:15,030 --> 04:24:17,190
I was like, where's the screen for... where's the scene for this?

6278
04:24:18,350 --> 04:24:19,050
Bye for real!

6279
04:24:19,110 --> 04:24:19,330
Bye!
