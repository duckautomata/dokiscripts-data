1
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:36,330
When the games begin, place your bets at 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO!

2
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:12,500
When the games begin, place your bets at 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO!

3
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:14,620
When the games begin, place your bets at 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO!

4
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:46,180
When the games begin, place your bets at 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO!

5
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:45,480
When the games begin, place your bets at 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO!

6
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:27,020
When the games begin, place your bets at 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO!

7
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:21,710
When the games begin, place your bets at 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO!

8
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,070
Mondays.

9
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,080
You need more training, dragoon!

10
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,640
Hello, everybody.

11
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
Wow, can't believe it.

12
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,920
I can't believe you dragoons couldn't even win.

13
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,400
Win the race.

14
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,040
Hello, everybody.

15
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,440
So, did you like the dragoon race test chat?

16
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,000
It was dope.

17
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,000
I did all of this in one go.

18
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,380
All of the race tests were done in one go.

19
00:19:59,520 --> 00:19:59,960
I did not.

20
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,060
I also thought you guys could win it.

21
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,440
Well, I guess you guys need more training.

22
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,780
So, what is this, might you ask?

23
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:18,880
So, if you guys didn't notice, this is actually a customized, do-it-your-own horse race test.

24
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,380
But instead of horse race test, it is the dragoon race test.

25
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:29,720
Yes, so if you guys didn't know about this game, it is a little miniature game, a little miniature simulation.

26
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,300
So, this isn't the announcement, by the way.

27
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,520
The announcement is later.

28
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,080
The announcement.

29
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,580
To get the announcement, you dragoons have to beat Doki Field.

30
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,300
And clearly, you guys did not beat Doki Field in our last race.

31
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,380
So, we're going to have to do more training.

32
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,280
So, in order to get your announcement, your very special announcement, you have to beat Doki Field.

33
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,600
So, let me give a huge shout-out to the original creator of this mod.

34
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,140
Or not mod.

35
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,860
The original creator of this game is by Stop Signal.

36
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,620
They created their own version of the horse race test.

37
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,280
So, like, you guys aren't, like, you know, Twitter brain-rotted like me.

38
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,700
It was an internet trend back then by Blake Andrews.

39
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,580
And his Twitter account is Snake Andrews.

40
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,960
And he made a little, like, internet thing where they put all these...

41
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,720
It was, like, basically a horse race test simulation.

42
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,280
And he...

43
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,440
Like, everybody was, like, rooting for these horses.

44
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,820
And then things got, like, super deep, the lore-wise and everything.

45
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,400
And I believe it's still going on now.

46
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,780
He brought it back.

47
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,360
But there is, like, more content towards it.

48
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,360
And then Stop Signal made his very own...

49
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,640
Him and his team made his very own do-it-yourself horse race test.

50
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,300
And then I did...

51
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,980
I was...

52
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,540
Okay, I have to say...

53
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,300
It was, like, a little game jam moment for me and my team.

54
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,620
Because I got this idea two weeks ago, I think.

55
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,620
A little bit, almost two weeks ago.

56
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,560
Maybe a week and a half.

57
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,220
I got this idea, like, a week and a half ago.

58
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,680
And to do my special announcement.

59
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,900
Because I was like, Ah, Doki, I miss when you were so creative back then.

60
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,480
And I want to go back to these creative things.

61
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,780
Doing creative stuff again.

62
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,320
Having these creative ideas.

63
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,720
Because...

64
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,380
And then Inspiration struck me a week and a half ago.

65
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,600
And...

66
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,760
And we did a little bit of, like, a little game jam session.

67
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,920
So, huge shout-out to the team.

68
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,360
For creating all of this.

69
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,420
Modding all of this.

70
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,660
So, this was done on the original game.

71
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,120
And they basically modded everything.

72
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,500
To make it more Doki Bird Dragoon themed.

73
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,640
And so, huge shout-out to that team for doing this.

74
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,440
Um, I'll say they're, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

75
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,160
Let's see.

76
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,060
Uh...

77
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh, wait.

78
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Wait, they're...

79
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,300
Oh!

80
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,980
Oh, there's an extra secret Doki, apparently.

81
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,120
I was just told that they did have a secret Doki from the Doki-verse in here.

82
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,460
That I didn't know of.

83
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,600
But huge shout-out to Lou, Kano, and Frel.

84
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,640
Uh, there was a team of three that modded and did the artwork of all of this, too.

85
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,880
So, huge shout-out to them.

86
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:45,060
And Ichio page will be linked, uh, linked whenever the dev, uh, whenever the dev gives me the link.

87
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,520
I will post the Ichio link for you guys.

88
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,440
So, you can customize your racetracks and everything.

89
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,000
So, let me show you guys real quick.

90
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,520
Um, so, you can see the dirt here.

91
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,200
I can customize this and everything.

92
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,320
This was originally in the original game.

93
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,000
But we also, like, um...

94
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,680
Redid some of the textures.

95
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,560
So, this used to be a house.

96
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,140
And now it's just a extra chonky dragoon.

97
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,940
I...

98
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,980
They're like, what should we replace this obstacle with?

99
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,060
And I wanna be like, I want an extra fat dragoon.

100
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,060
An absolute unit.

101
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,240
So, you can put this anywhere you want.

102
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,060
Not on the dirt.

103
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,900
And then there's also, like, punchers here.

104
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,780
And then there's mines and everything.

105
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,800
So, you can customize it fully.

106
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,620
And then, obviously, here are...

107
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,280
Here are...

108
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,800
Here's all of them.

109
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,940
They all have their little sound effects.

110
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,680
Pearl did the dragoons.

111
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,760
So, and then I did, obviously...

112
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,020
I voiced the tomato.

113
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,780
I voiced all the doki's from the doki-verse.

114
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,460
And then I even got dad to bark on the mic for me.

115
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,780
And then there's tomato goon.

116
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,500
So, let me put all of them in here.

117
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,720
So, and then we press start race.

118
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,460
And then...

119
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,320
There they go.

120
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,420
I don't know if they can get out.

121
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,920
I think I locked them in.

122
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,020
So, this is all...

123
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,500
This is all fully customizable.

124
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,900
There will be an itch.io link that I'll send to you guys.

125
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,360
And you too can, um...

126
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,520
You can, like, edit your tracks.

127
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,620
Make your own tracks.

128
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,000
Play around with it yourself.

129
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,100
Maybe even customize your own map.

130
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,820
Like, maps.

131
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,020
Add more doki's if you want to.

132
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,120
So, yeah.

133
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,920
I thought it was really fun.

134
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,220
Anyway, so clearly we gotta do...

135
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,820
We gotta train you guys more.

136
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,540
Because you can't be...

137
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,240
I feel like you guys are struggling...

138
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,160
To beat any of the doki's from the doki-verse.

139
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Because I mean the tomato.

140
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,680
Tomato one, dragoons.

141
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,860
Oh, is the game loud?

142
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,620
I'm sorry.

143
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,780
I'm sorry.

144
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,900
I'll turn it down a little.

145
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,640
I'll turn it down a little.

146
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,620
But all I'm saying is that you guys seem to be struggling...

147
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,640
Beating any of the dragoons...

148
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,620
Any of the doki's from the doki-verse.

149
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,240
Hmm.

150
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,780
Guess we got...

151
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,100
Guess you're not gonna get your announcement until...

152
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,140
Guess you can't get your announcement...

153
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,140
Until you beat a doki.

154
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,260
Alright.

155
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,840
So, here is the link.

156
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,460
If you want to play with it yourself.

157
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,660
Here is the link to the itch.io.

158
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,280
I will do...

159
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,920
Give the link...

160
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,220
I'll pin the link...

161
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,160
Um...

162
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,600
Pin the link for it...

163
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,500
At the end of the announcement...

164
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,380
So those who want to download it...

165
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,240
Can download it...

166
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,280
Experience it yourself.

167
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,680
Let me show the image real quick...

168
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,280
Too for it.

169
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,100
Huge shout out to my editor...

170
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,300
Uh...

171
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,660
Hebe.

172
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,000
She's also the thumbnail maker.

173
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,960
She helped me put together the video...

174
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,180
All the videos...

175
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,600
Um...

176
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,080
Itself.

177
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,000
So...

178
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,440
Um...

179
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,500
Last minute as well.

180
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,740
Because I was like...

181
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:49,960
I...

182
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,140
You know...

183
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,160
The idea came to me.

184
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,720
And I was like...

185
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,500
Oh my god...

186
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,520
I want to have like...

187
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,500
A little video...

188
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,700
Instead of like...

189
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,020
Uh...

190
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,580
To like...

191
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,460
Build the lore.

192
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
So here you go.

193
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,480
It's a...

194
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,300
Do it yourself.

195
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,760
Horse race...

196
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,080
Thing.

197
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,940
Doki mod.

198
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,880
So...

199
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,980
We did...

200
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,320
Add more stuff to it.

201
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:11,940
We added...

202
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,220
You know...

203
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,160
Our own characters.

204
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,540
Uh...

205
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,620
We added like...

206
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,940
New features to it.

207
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,440
Uh...

208
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,080
So there's like...

209
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,260
Little adjustments to it...

210
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,580
From compared to the original...

211
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,540
Original game.

212
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:21,920
So...

213
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,280
Uh...

214
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,360
I hope you guys all enjoyed.

215
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,000
Uh...

216
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,500
Stop Signal.

217
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,380
Thank you for the super chat.

218
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:25,600
Yeah!

219
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,120
There he is!

220
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,800
That's the creator!

221
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,540
That's the creator of the original game.

222
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,160
Uh...

223
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,940
Stop Signal here.

224
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,460
The dev.

225
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,660
Thanks for playing, Doki.

226
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,160
Thank you again for making such an amazing game.

227
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,180
And letting me mod it and everything.

228
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,240
I really appreciate it.

229
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:37,880
By the way...

230
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,060
Stop Signal actually like...

231
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,600
Replied back today...

232
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:40,920
To us.

233
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,560
So I was like...

234
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:41,800
Oh...

235
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,240
I was like...

236
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,420
Super happy and thankful.

237
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,280
Um...

238
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,040
Because we were just gonna do it on a Google Drive.

239
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:46,880
Um...

240
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,300
Because like...

241
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,240
I didn't wanna like...

242
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,540
Step on any toes or anything.

243
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,200
And then later on we were like...

244
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,940
Okay, maybe we put it on Itch.io for a bit.

245
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,960
And then like...

246
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,400
See if he'll reply back.

247
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,920
And then if it confirms and everything.

248
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:58,780
So...

249
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,400
I'm super happy that...

250
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,660
Um...

251
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,000
We got Stop Signal's approval.

252
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,420
And blessing to upload it on Itch.io and everything.

253
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,480
I really appreciate it.

254
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,180
Thank you again!

255
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,940
But yes, I hope you guys...

256
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,860
Have a lot of fun with this horse race test.

257
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,460
Or Dragoon race test mod.

258
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,420
Um...

259
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,040
Anyway...

260
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,200
Let's train you guys.

261
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,500
I have the perfect map to train all of you guys in.

262
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,880
Ha ha ha ha!

263
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,900
It is...

264
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,820
Also, you can adjust the...

265
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,560
You can adjust the starting line.

266
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,680
So like if you wanna cheat and have like...

267
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
I don't know...

268
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,420
Like, you know...

269
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,840
Let him win something.

270
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,440
Like right here.

271
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,920
I can literally put him next to it.

272
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,100
And...

273
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,780
Okay.

274
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,770
Ha ha ha ha!

275
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,190
He's not a racer guy.

276
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,050
He's...

277
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,150
He's a lover.

278
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,010
I tell you...

279
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,110
It's all RNG!

280
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,850
No more training for all of you.

281
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,650
Oh...

282
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,030
Oh...

283
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,730
Oh...

284
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,790
Oh...

285
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:42,990
Oh...

286
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,690
Oh...

287
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,730
Oh...

288
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,670
Oh...

289
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:45,770
Oh...

290
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:45,870
Oh...

291
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,150
Oh...

292
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,850
Oh...

293
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:47,970
Oh...

294
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,690
Oh...

295
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,250
Oh...

296
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,210
Oh...

297
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:52,230
Oh...

298
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,010
Oh...

299
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,070
Oh...

300
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,930
Oh...

301
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,630
Oh...

302
00:29:59,630 --> 00:29:59,710
Oh...

303
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,890
Oh...

304
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,710
Let's make it.

305
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,790
This is hell.

306
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,770
It's okay.

307
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,710
Look, see it?

308
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,790
There's no way.

309
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,530
There's no... I don't even have to... Okay, I lowered it.

310
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,110
There's a better now, sound guy.

311
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,470
I lowered the volume.

312
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,150
Look, it's training.

313
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,930
Eventually, one of you guys will make it.

314
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,990
Welcome to hell.

315
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,370
This is hell.

316
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,790
Okay, I can lower it more.

317
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,190
Alright, here we go.

318
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:34,990
There we go.

319
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,890
That should be better.

320
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,570
I swear to God, if none of you drag booms, get it in.

321
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,070
The fabled five big booms.

322
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,650
I believe.

323
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,510
Surely you guys can make it.

324
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,550
Surely you guys can make it to the end.

325
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,410
This map gets five big booms.

326
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,330
Oh my God, Chalky!

327
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,370
Chalky, the bombs are literally taking you to the end goal!

328
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,430
You can't fuck this up!

329
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,310
Chalky!

330
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:02,910
Oh!

331
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,910
Alright, I was gonna say it.

332
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,310
Chalky, if you fuck this up, then that's on you.

333
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,350
Chalky will have merriment.

334
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,370
Alright.

335
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,010
Alright, let's clear.

336
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,370
Let's clear all of this.

337
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,050
Alright, I think there will be...

338
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,850
Yeah, so we can basically play around with this.

339
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,950
And there's, like, swapping tilesets, so, like, things look different.

340
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,330
So, I'll show you guys.

341
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:42,290
Like, things will each... So, the Chalky Goon will turn into, uh, into, like, trees, depending on what settings you're on.

342
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:47,450
So, I'll put some of these around for you guys so you can see how different they look and everything.

343
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,190
And also, there's, like, settings here.

344
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,690
Like, you can make them not trip.

345
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,430
You can, like, bump, not bump.

346
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,670
The horse name, uh, which would be the dragoon name.

347
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,090
It would be, like, ma, ma, ma.

348
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,770
And then resetting the level.

349
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:04,370
So, if you change the tileset, you can see that the Chalky Goons turn into trees.

350
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,090
We don't know how to fix that yet.

351
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,670
We don't really know how to fix that.

352
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,450
But, not yet.

353
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,290
Like I said, it was, like, a little game jam session.

354
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,770
But there are trees now.

355
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,630
There are also trees here as well.

356
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,750
So, but then, you know, when you're at the grass, they're back to Chalky.

357
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,050
They're just extra Chalky again.

358
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,650
It's their, it's their little, yeah.

359
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,490
Yeah, it's just the extra Chalky Goon just, like, turns into a tree somehow.

360
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,330
Alright.

361
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,770
Let's make, let's, you know, let's customize this a little bit.

362
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,170
Alright.

363
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,570
And then, you know, I want to put the trophy right here.

364
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,150
And then, we'll see if, let's see.

365
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,290
Maybe, actually, no.

366
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,290
I'll put the trophy right here.

367
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,770
And then, we'll turn the dirt like that.

368
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,030
And then, oh, wait.

369
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,930
Can he make it?

370
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,230
Can he make it?

371
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:07,930
Alright.

372
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,890
There's no, the countdown voice was edited in by Heavey.

373
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,430
Um, she was, she was the one that customized, uh, customized it to make it more.

374
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,610
I gave her, like, instructions on, like, how I wanted the video to look like.

375
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,890
And she did it perfectly within, like, a day.

376
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,010
Um, and that, like, last minute edits, like, within, like, two hours ago.

377
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,670
And she did it perfectly.

378
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:35,810
I was so happy that, uh, we were able to get the, the, the dumb things I wanted to do for the video.

379
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,550
I was, I was very happy about it.

380
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,470
I was, like, I was, I, I don't know.

381
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:48,350
I just, I had, like, specific instructions and, like, she was able to, like, replicate it and everything.

382
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,010
Um, alright, let's go.

383
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,470
Okay, let's put some...

384
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,630
Alright, here we go.

385
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,670
Yeah, get past the minefields first.

386
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,870
Dragoons, I believe.

387
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,250
If you can get past this, you can get past anything.

388
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:02,910
Alright.

389
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,270
Place your bets, dragoons!

390
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,010
War never changes.

391
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,470
Place your bets.

392
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,970
Who do you think will win?

393
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,450
We're out of hell now.

394
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,790
You can turn it back up.

395
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:28,630
Alright.

396
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,070
Out of the hell's portal.

397
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,630
The hell universe.

398
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,910
I think this is my favorite part.

399
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,390
They asked me, like, can you guys send, uh, uh...

400
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,490
Doki, can you send, like, dad photos for us?

401
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,250
So, like, when he falls down, we'll just Photoshop dad into...

402
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,870
It's my favorite!

403
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,050
Like, I...

404
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,970
He had, like, the perfect pose of him just lying on his back.

405
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,370
Oh my god!

406
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,830
This is the closest Longoon has ever been!

407
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,650
To, like, the trophy!

408
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,350
There's no way he'll fuck it up!

409
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,890
There's no way!

410
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,610
This is the closest you've ever been, Longoon!

411
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,590
Ha ha ha ha!

412
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,050
Ha ha ha ha!

413
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:08,410
Ha ha ha ha!

414
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,070
And then he's gonna, like, get out of him!

415
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,090
Oh my god!

416
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,390
And then the regular Goon from...

417
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,910
Nowhere!

418
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,550
From downtown!

419
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,370
Oh my...

420
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,790
Now the Ingoon's here!

421
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,550
Ha ha ha!

422
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,410
Longoon!

423
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,630
Longoon!

424
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,630
Longoon's been stuck here for the longest time!

425
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,470
Ha ha ha!

426
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,910
We've been closer!

427
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:26,850
Stop!

428
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:27,590
Oh!

429
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,610
Goodbye Longoon!

430
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,190
It was nice seeing you down there.

431
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:31,970
Goodbye!

432
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,730
Ha ha ha ha!

433
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,610
Wait, how did Krookie get down here?

434
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,990
Longo number uno, I believe.

435
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,050
Yes, thank you for the super chat.

436
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,230
Thank you, thank you.

437
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,570
Oh my god, Longo's back!

438
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,470
Oh my god, the punch is putting him closer.

439
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:56,250
Oh... Poor Longo.

440
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,950
Please, the trophy's right here.

441
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,030
Oh, Krookie, come on.

442
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:04,850
You're like right there.

443
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,010
You're actually right there.

444
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:06,470
No!

445
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,610
He almost... Oh, he's back!

446
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,110
He's fucking back!

447
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,410
Krookie, Krookie, come on!

448
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,210
Do it for the Doki-verse!

449
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,430
For the Doki-verse, Krookie!

450
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,130
That dang Chalky-coon.

451
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,470
Krookie, stop joking!

452
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,210
Oh, goodbye, Krookie.

453
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,630
Krookie, go for Krookie.

454
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,410
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

455
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,430
Thank you, thank you.

456
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,350
Oh my god, I...

457
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,290
Please, Krookie, come on!

458
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,190
Oh my god, Tomato, let's do this!

459
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,170
Four times!

460
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,610
The four-time champion!

461
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,210
Let's go!

462
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,730
Another Doki-verse wins!

463
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,630
No way!

464
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,750
Where the fuck did the Tomato come from?

465
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,810
Oh wait, I think I'm gonna be left-side... Okay, give me a sec.

466
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,630
I realize I may or may have to be left-side Doki.

467
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,010
She's finally back, guys!

468
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,230
She's back from retirement!

469
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:21,010
I guess we need more training, Dragoons!

470
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,630
You're not getting your announcement and I'll tell you when, guys!

471
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,430
Not so dreadful!

472
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,290
Lagoon has no girth, so he has no worth.

473
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,570
Chunky-goon has a way to keep him great.

474
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,210
Thank you for the super chat!

475
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,130
Thank you, thank you!

476
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,950
Wait, what is the secret...?

477
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,770
I don't know what the secret Doki is!

478
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,130
Okay, how do I do it?

479
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,770
If you right-click on the Dragoon in the character creator, you will unveil...

480
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,150
Wait, what?

481
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,610
How do I do that?

482
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,490
Okay, wait...

483
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,770
The Dragoon... is it here?

484
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,690
Oh, wait, not here.

485
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,550
How do I...

486
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:01,650
Create...

487
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,970
How do I do it?

488
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:06,390
Okay, I need the dev to give me a step-by-step guide.

489
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:06,970
I don't...

490
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,510
They said...

491
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,330
They said we can unlock a new...

492
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,550
A new Doki.

493
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,350
I don't know how.

494
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,890
How do you unlock a new Doki?

495
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,130
What is this?

496
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,390
Okay.

497
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:25,530
I'll...

498
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,010
They'll let me know later.

499
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,550
The secret Doki.

500
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,450
Instructions unclear.

501
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,410
Guys, I'm too stupid for this.

502
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:34,990
I don't know.

503
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,150
Okay, don't worry.

504
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,090
Right-click.

505
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,310
Oh, Dragoon image?

506
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,090
Oh, okay.

507
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,530
Well, that's not it.

508
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,170
Don't worry.

509
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,210
They'll tell me later.

510
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,510
I'll be like...

511
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,150
Wait, I should mess it.

512
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,670
How do I unlock...

513
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,170
Step-by-step...

514
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,090
On how to unlock...

515
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,490
The secret Dragoon.

516
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,490
Please.

517
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,630
I know.

518
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,410
Understand.

519
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,150
Oh, like here?

520
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:06,950
No?

521
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,010
I can't...

522
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,270
I can't keep myself.

523
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:11,870
Please.

524
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,070
Oh.

525
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,990
Maybe like...

526
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:28,920
Jovey.

527
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,180
Oh.

528
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,460
Don't keep it.

529
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,600
Alright.

530
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,900
It's time.

531
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,120
This should...

532
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,260
No.

533
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,400
This should be the final match.

534
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,980
The...

535
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,780
This should be the...

536
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,100
Okay.

537
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,900
Let me...

538
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,800
Actually, let me see.

539
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,560
I don't want...

540
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,500
I don't want to...

541
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,760
Oh, my God.

542
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,700
She's too strong.

543
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,080
It's Jo Dharma.

544
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,200
Oh, my God.

545
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,400
Jo Ban is too strong.

546
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,080
She's already getting closer.

547
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
Yeah.

548
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,400
Okay.

549
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,300
Oh, my God.

550
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,880
That was the hidden... that was a hidden secret from the team, the dev team.

551
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,620
Oh my god, you go Jovio Dokument!

552
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,680
You go!

553
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,660
It's too powerful!

554
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,100
Damn baby!

555
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,240
The spirit of Jovio lives on!

556
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,900
Guys, he's... the Chonky Goon is part of your community!

557
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,480
Do you not believe in him?

558
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,600
Do you not believe in your own god?

559
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,360
Just cleaning up all of mine.

560
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,000
Chonky Goon, lock it in!

561
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,400
Guys...

562
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,660
If Chonky Goon can win this, you guys get the announcement early.

563
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,470
I mean...

564
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,330
If Chonky Goon can win this, you get the announcement.

565
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,210
Oh, he moved on.

566
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,550
I don't know, he hasn't...

567
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:24,710
Oh!

568
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,110
He's left the cage!

569
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,490
He's left the cage!

570
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:28,870
Oh!

571
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,190
Jovio, no!

572
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:30,990
Nice!

573
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,010
The impact!

574
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,130
Dokument!

575
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,610
Yes!

576
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,150
Let's go!

577
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,650
The impact sent in her back!

578
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,410
He's going back!

579
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,750
There's still one mine left for Chonky Goon.

580
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,790
He has to finish the job!

581
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,150
No!

582
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,570
Jovio!

583
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,310
What are you doing?

584
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,430
Oh, he just wanted to say hi.

585
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,390
Okay, that's...

586
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,770
That's fine.

587
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,030
That's fine.

588
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:56,690
Oh, nice!

589
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:57,410
He got it!

590
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,670
He finished the job!

591
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,810
He's finished the job, guys!

592
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,330
It's okay!

593
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,270
No!

594
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,450
Chonky Goons!

595
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,790
I don't know why Chonkiness can beat those kicked up cheeks!

596
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,690
Thank you for the super chat!

597
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,050
Thank you!

598
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:12,690
Thank you!

599
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,590
Jovio, Dokument 2D Model!

600
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,090
What?

601
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,230
Look at the...

602
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:17,990
They give us a super chat!

603
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,310
Thank you!

604
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:18,950
Thank you!

605
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,450
It's okay!

606
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,850
It's okay!

607
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:23,430
I believe!

608
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,370
Come on, Doki!

609
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,430
Don't disappoint the Dokis from the Doki-verse!

610
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,630
The Doki Council is watching right now!

611
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,270
I believe!

612
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,590
Come on!

613
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:42,530
Doki Field was able to single-handedly beat Chonky Goon all on her own!

614
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,170
Come on, Jovio!

615
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,590
The Doki Council is judging you right now!

616
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,050
Oh, nice!

617
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:50,430
Nice!

618
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,190
Take him back to the corner!

619
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,310
Take him back in there!

620
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Chonky wins!

621
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,220
He'll have my respect!

622
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,160
That's good!

623
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:04,800
He's stuck!

624
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:05,840
He's stuck!

625
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,540
He can't do anything!

626
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,000
No!

627
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,460
Jovio's stuck!

628
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,900
Jovio, please!

629
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,020
Get out of the prison!

630
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,380
Get out, Jovio!

631
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,120
Come on!

632
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,780
The door is stuck!

633
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,560
They're both stuck!

634
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,100
They're both stuck!

635
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,420
But how is Chonky stuck in a bigger hole?

636
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,400
Get Chonky's up for fines!

637
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,820
His only task is just mines!

638
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,940
Please, I need this!

639
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,400
Come on!

640
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,980
Come on, Jovio!

641
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,780
We can't give them the announcement yet!

642
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,820
We still need to pad more time!

643
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,620
We need to pad as much time as we can!

644
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,540
Why the hell is this so intense?

645
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,800
Welcome to the Dragoon Horse Race!

646
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,760
The Dragoon, welcome to the Dragoon Race Test!

647
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,480
I hope you enjoy your stay!

648
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,400
That was basically what Twitter was like for two weeks, guys!

649
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,480
This was Twitter for two fucking weeks!

650
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,980
I'm gonna turn it up a little bit more!

651
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,260
Oh my god!

652
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,550
You guys swap places?!

653
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:26,870
I...

654
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,130
I...

655
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,910
How did you guys swap places?!

656
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,150
Get out!

657
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,050
You know!

658
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,810
Great big body, teeny tiny brain!

659
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,950
Thank you for the zipper chat, Ace!

660
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:45,930
Oh my god!

661
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:46,730
Oh my god!

662
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:47,830
Now you're puffing!

663
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:53,070
Chonky-kun was like, I wanna be back in my safe space!

664
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:58,950
I want to be safe again.

665
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,550
Please, leave the hole!

666
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,290
Leave the widening of it.

667
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:10,670
He wanted to go home.

668
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,990
Oh my god, it's been five minutes.

669
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,870
Get out of here!

670
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,710
One of you!

671
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,350
It's been five.

672
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:22,850
No, not you though!

673
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:23,710
Not you!

674
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,570
Get back in the hole!

675
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:25,850
No!

676
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:26,870
Get back in the hole!

677
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,910
Oh my god, they're both in... No!

678
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:29,490
Jovial!

679
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:29,970
No!

680
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:30,670
Jovial!

681
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:31,170
No!

682
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,590
Get back in there!

683
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:33,290
No!

684
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,230
Oh, thank god!

685
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,430
Oh, thank god, Chucky!

686
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:38,230
Thank god!

687
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,450
Oh, he's back home!

688
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,870
He's back home again.

689
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:49,650
This tough thing is, Jovial could have won this five minutes ago, but she certainly needed a bad time.

690
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,390
So she's stalling.

691
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,650
Thank you for the super chap thing.

692
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:54,530
No!

693
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:55,210
No!

694
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,010
Get out!

695
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:56,670
Get out!

696
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,270
I need a bad more time!

697
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,410
I didn't expect you to... No, Chucky!

698
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:03,770
Please!

699
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:04,570
No!

700
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,410
Go back home!

701
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,190
Go back home!

702
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,030
Go back home!

703
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:08,790
You're so close!

704
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:09,130
Yes!

705
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:09,610
Yes!

706
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:10,250
Go home!

707
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,350
Go home!

708
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,430
Yes!

709
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,170
Thank you for the same time!

710
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:19,170
kneel!

711
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:19,170
Michael took out!

712
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,250
The thumbnail holodex Sound off the part of Dr går начинаются just says, Goon!

713
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,910
Goon!

714
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,270
Race Test!

715
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:28,250
Thank god!

716
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,090
He choked!

717
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:29,950
Nice!

718
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,310
As you should!

719
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:35,930
You didn't learn from your last race, did you Chunky Goon?

720
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,030
He didn't learn!

721
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,230
Chalk more like chalked.

722
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,690
The choke is real.

723
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,510
Yes, keep choking.

724
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,610
Come on, Doki.

725
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,930
Don't disappoint the Doki-verse.

726
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,610
We have such a high record of winning.

727
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,730
We beat all those dragons.

728
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,870
Your tomato, your tomato, Doki, is a four-time champion.

729
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,710
Chalky police.

730
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,490
Oh my god.

731
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:11,090
Guys, I might have designed a really fucking hard track accidentally.

732
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:19,810
I might have fucked up a little bit by making a really hard track for them.

733
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,150
I didn't think this would be that difficult.

734
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,690
I thought it'd be a little easier.

735
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,230
It's a bit tough.

736
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,510
Please.

737
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,590
Please.

738
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,770
Get out of the hole, Jovio!

739
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,510
Oh.

740
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:34,970
Oh.

741
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,330
Sorry, I accidentally paused it.

742
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:36,990
I...

743
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,790
I was too angry.

744
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:43,490
I was too angry that I paused the game.

745
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,070
I...

746
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,350
Guys, you don't see it yet.

747
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,730
The Dragoon may be rigged.

748
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,130
Cryopan, thank you for the super chat.

749
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,910
Thank you, thank you.

750
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,170
There's no entitlement.

751
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,730
We could be here forever.

752
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,710
Not so deadpool.

753
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:01,010
Thank you for the super chat.

754
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,010
Thank you, thank you.

755
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:02,530
Oh!

756
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:03,010
No!

757
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:03,730
Come on!

758
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:04,610
It's so close!

759
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,430
You were just there!

760
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,630
You were just there, Jovio!

761
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,550
You were literally just there!

762
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,130
Come on!

763
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:12,950
Come on!

764
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:13,410
Come on!

765
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:13,550
No!

766
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,410
It's in the corner!

767
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,350
Your cake is too big!

768
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,150
Yes!

769
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:19,590
Jovio!

770
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,210
There is the super chat.

771
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:27,430
Thank you, thank you.

772
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,430
Thank you.

773
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:28,550
Thank you!

774
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,730
That's right, aged poorly.

775
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,870
Joe... Jovio is winning at making dieki crash up.

776
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,490
That's right, your super chat age poorly!

777
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:44,690
That's right, another one for the Doki's in the Doki-verse.

778
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,950
That's right, Dracoons.

779
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:48,430
You need more training.

780
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,050
Great.

781
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,010
Just, I don't know, just be better, I guess.

782
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,590
Just... I don't know.

783
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:58,530
I guess just...

784
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,090
Get good.

785
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,270
So, I'll even help you guys.

786
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,350
How about this?

787
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,390
I'll put in... All right.

788
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:09,090
All right, let's see.

789
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:13,330
Maybe we just need to figure out who is the best drag wound out of all of you.

790
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:14,230
Don't worry.

791
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:16,930
I have some pre-made maps that we could use.

792
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,310
I think you'll need it anyway.

793
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,910
You guys definitely need it.

794
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:27,950
Not Jovial?

795
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,130
I mean...

796
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,630
You guys were struggling so much.

797
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,590
I think I gotta... I think I gotta make it a little bit easier for you guys.

798
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,230
You guys were struggling there.

799
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,090
So...

800
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:41,350
Let me make it just a little bit easier for all of you guys.

801
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,170
All right.

802
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:43,370
Here we go.

803
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,170
You know what?

804
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,550
Here, let all you Dragoons race each other too.

805
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,550
He, he, he, he, he...

806
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,150
He, he, he, he...

807
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,590
Perina rules, Jovial loss.

808
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:56,190
The dragon.

809
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,690
Thank you for the super chat.

810
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,850
Thank you, thank you.

811
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,630
We don't need...

812
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,130
Look here.

813
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,610
Here's an easier map too, Dragoons.

814
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:06,150
Maybe...

815
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,070
Maybe this is more of your...

816
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,030
Maybe this is more for you guys.

817
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:11,350
You know, this track was...

818
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,050
Was made for you guys.

819
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,730
Guys, you know, someone can win.

820
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:17,090
At least a dragoon can win, guys.

821
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:26,010
Alright, but if the tomato goon wins, he's one of us.

822
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:30,070
I get custody of tomato goon every weekend.

823
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,690
And today's a weekend.

824
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,870
Oh my god, that would be so sad.

825
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,090
Guys, if the tomato goon wins...

826
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:38,570
Oh...

827
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,950
Long goon, you're tired of the shine.

828
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:48,730
Today's the weekend.

829
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,570
I get custody of tomato goon.

830
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:51,650
On the weekend.

831
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,850
So technically, he's part of the Jokeyverse.

832
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:55,930
That's right.

833
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:57,590
It's not rigged if you're just...

834
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:57,910
No!

835
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:58,290
No!

836
00:50:58,830 --> 00:50:58,950
No!

837
00:50:58,950 --> 00:50:59,210
No!

838
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:00,490
No!

839
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,810
You were so close!

840
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,670
You were so close!

841
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,290
You know what's even sad, though?

842
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,930
Alright, there's...

843
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,450
Alright, let's see.

844
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,430
I think...

845
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:21,010
Alright.

846
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,410
There's no way.

847
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:22,970
Okay.

848
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:25,530
Alright, well...

849
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,790
Long goon, surely...

850
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,070
Surely...

851
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,850
You can't fuck this up, right?

852
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,830
Here, I'll just put a couple of here.

853
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:35,690
There we go.

854
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:36,650
Alright.

855
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,330
Long goon, I believe.

856
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,910
You can't...

857
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,570
Surely you can win one match.

858
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,650
One game.

859
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:46,530
Right?

860
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,310
Long goon...

861
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:49,350
Can't be that bad.

862
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,150
I believe in you.

863
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,270
No, he can't win.

864
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:55,430
I...

865
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:59,290
Come on.

866
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,750
Just get out of there.

867
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,030
Five hours later.

868
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:03,610
Come on.

869
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,050
You can't get out of there.

870
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:06,490
Come on.

871
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:07,950
Yeah, he's our scion.

872
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,110
The back room.

873
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:11,570
I can't even...

874
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,130
Get through the fucking hallway.

875
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,270
Come on.

876
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,390
Surely, look.

877
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,330
He's helping you.

878
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,430
Just get out of the hallway.

879
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,670
Just that...

880
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:23,850
That tiny hallway.

881
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,950
There's two holes.

882
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,410
There's two holes, Long goon.

883
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:28,850
Two fucking holes.

884
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,250
Surely you can make it through.

885
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,950
You're not chonky like the chonky dragon.

886
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,170
You can fit in there.

887
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:34,330
There's two holes in there.

888
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,970
This is horrible map.

889
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:41,310
Sounds like a long goon.

890
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,930
It's so much pain.

891
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:47,370
Come on.

892
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,590
The hole is literally right there.

893
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:50,890
It's right...

894
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,450
Just get out of that one hole, Long goon.

895
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,410
You got this.

896
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,690
Cyclone, thank you for the super chat.

897
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:05,030
Thank you.

898
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,010
Thank you.

899
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,490
The Robin, thank you for the super chat.

900
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,810
Thank you.

901
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:09,410
Thank you.

902
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,010
Vaughn, watch your skip three hours.

903
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,670
Guys, he's one of you.

904
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:15,930
Do you not believe in your own brethren?

905
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,370
Your own brother.

906
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,310
The dragon can't find the hole.

907
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:23,230
No.

908
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,810
Long goons.

909
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:26,710
What happened?

910
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,130
This is your representative.

911
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,630
This is your representative that you picked to send to the race.

912
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,550
To the dragon race test.

913
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:35,890
You picked him.

914
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,330
He's your tribute.

915
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:42,930
Hell no.

916
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,430
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

917
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:45,790
Thank you.

918
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:46,470
Thank you.

919
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,370
Thank you for the super chat.

920
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:48,890
Thank you.

921
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:49,650
Thank you.

922
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,350
Oh, he's stupid.

923
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:52,870
Stupid.

924
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:53,810
Okay.

925
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:54,690
Okay.

926
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:58,170
His goal is to like go through the hole at least once.

927
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,650
If he goes through that hole...

928
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:01,970
Any either of the holes.

929
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:02,810
Once.

930
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,530
Within five minutes.

931
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,530
We will count this as a victory.

932
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,770
That's all we want.

933
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,110
Next thing again.

934
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,070
Thank you for the super chat.

935
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:18,270
Thank you.

936
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:18,690
Thank you.

937
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,350
I've never been so ashamed to be along.

938
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:21,110
Oh my god.

939
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:21,710
He's doing it.

940
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,710
He's doing it.

941
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:23,890
Oh my god.

942
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:25,210
He got out.

943
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,550
He got out of the hole.

944
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,160
As long as he doesn't go back.

945
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,060
It's a victory.

946
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:32,820
Oh my god.

947
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,680
And he did it within five minutes.

948
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,340
Look at that.

949
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:35,620
See?

950
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,460
I told you.

951
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,720
I told you.

952
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,600
He's special.

953
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,800
But like the good kind is special.

954
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,360
Good.

955
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,540
Thank you again for the super chat.

956
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:46,860
Thank you.

957
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,480
Thank you.

958
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,180
Kaz, look at him go, dude.

959
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,100
What a legend.

960
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,960
Sheer perseverance and determination.

961
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,800
Thank you for the super chat.

962
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,220
Thank you.

963
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:55,760
Thank you.

964
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,540
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

965
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:57,840
Thank you.

966
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,380
Thank you.

967
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,840
Two weeks till I age out of being a long guy.

968
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,080
Thank God.

969
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,600
He's like, please.

970
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,080
Please, I want to be a real winner.

971
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,240
Make me chonky right now.

972
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,160
Spam, thank you for the super chat.

973
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,440
Thank you.

974
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,000
Thank you.

975
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,680
We believe it will take three hours.

976
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,460
Oh, he's going back to the... He's like, please, mother.

977
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,220
Put me back in the hole.

978
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,220
I feel more safe in the hole.

979
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,860
I... I want to go back.

980
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,280
No.

981
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:32,680
No.

982
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,960
The hunker needs to go to Google Maps.

983
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,300
Come on.

984
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,480
It's right there.

985
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,940
That's the other hole you need to get to.

986
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,060
Bro fighting himself and losing.

987
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,120
Thank you for the super chat.

988
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:45,500
Thank you.

989
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,320
Thank you.

990
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:46,860
Alright.

991
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,520
If Long Goon doesn't hit the objective within 10 minutes, I'm sorry.

992
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,060
He's got to be trapped in hell.

993
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,680
I... Yes.

994
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:03,700
He is... He will be exiled from the Dragoon race test if he can't get out of here in 10 minutes.

995
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,620
He's lost.

996
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,380
Please free him.

997
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,000
He's gonna get... We're gonna delete him from the game files, chat.

998
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:19,100
We have the version... Version... 5.0.

999
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,740
We remove Long Goon from the data.

1000
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,540
He went back.

1001
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,000
Chunky chat.

1002
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:29,860
Thriving.

1003
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,180
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1004
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:31,480
Thank you.

1005
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,160
Thank you.

1006
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,600
Uh, eating, thank you for the super chat.

1007
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,440
Thank you, thank you.

1008
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,360
Oh boy, this ring keeps hitting me when I step on it.

1009
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,320
Maybe I should step on it more.

1010
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,240
Ryan, thank you for the super chat.

1011
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,020
Thank you, thank you.

1012
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,240
I was here when Lagos got sent to hell.

1013
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,360
Dear representative, your tribute is gonna get you to lead it from existence.

1014
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,520
We're gonna fucking fatter snap you out of this game.

1015
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,100
It's like, what do you mean?

1016
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,800
We never had long goons.

1017
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,040
There's always been four.

1018
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:11,200
There's always been... There's always been regular goons, chonky goons, and egg goons.

1019
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,560
It's always been three.

1020
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:13,860
Never four.

1021
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:23,580
It was never long goons in passing say.

1022
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,960
I even, like, changed my sub badges.

1023
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,800
Like, they just never existed.

1024
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,300
You're fighting for your existence.

1025
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,360
Come on!

1026
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,260
Don't do this to me!

1027
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,600
Unlucky, thank you for the super chat.

1028
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,420
Thank you, thank you.

1029
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,160
Long goons, why did you go back to the hole?

1030
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,360
I'm worried.

1031
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,480
Thank you for the super chat.

1032
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,340
Thank you.

1033
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,580
Actually, thank you for the super chat.

1034
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,440
Thank you, thank you.

1035
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,960
It's okay, Long goons.

1036
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,820
You go when you feel like it.

1037
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,980
It's a test!

1038
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,400
He can't test up limited time limits, guys.

1039
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,920
There's a time limit in tests.

1040
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,500
He can't just go when he wants to.

1041
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,180
Thank you.

1042
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,100
He just really loves that screen.

1043
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,060
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

1044
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:21,980
Thank you, thank you.

1045
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,500
I'm proud of him for trying.

1046
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,280
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

1047
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,060
Thank you, thank you.

1048
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:30,600
If you didn't read my message, Long goons has two brain cells and both are fighting for third place.

1049
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,640
If Long goon ever had a thought, it died alone and afraid.

1050
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,240
Come on, Long goon.

1051
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,760
Come on, in four minutes, you can get out of that hole.

1052
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1053
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,020
Thank you, thank you.

1054
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,620
Why does he keep getting punched?

1055
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,500
Is he stupid?

1056
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,320
He's... Look, hey, hey, look.

1057
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,640
We have... Okay, Long goons.

1058
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,980
Long goons, defend yourself.

1059
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,320
Why is he like this?

1060
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,200
Long goons, defend yourself.

1061
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,640
He's just like me.

1062
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:20,940
He is.

1063
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,160
He's me.

1064
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,020
What do you mean?

1065
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:30,920
What do you mean?

1066
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,740
He doesn't represent you.

1067
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,980
He was chosen.

1068
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,540
You picked him.

1069
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,700
Please, Doki, don't delete Long goon.

1070
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,620
He taught me how to love.

1071
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,300
Thank you for the super chat.

1072
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,200
Thank you, thank you.

1073
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,460
TikTok, two more minutes.

1074
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,000
Good.

1075
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,640
Thank you for the super chat.

1076
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,500
Thank you, thank you.

1077
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,540
Here for Long goons, public exile in less than four minutes.

1078
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1079
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,640
Thank you, thank you.

1080
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:07,700
TikTok.

1081
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,860
He's about to get deleted.

1082
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,200
TikTok.

1083
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,500
Oh my god, he like...

1084
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,300
He like entered that hole and then he got afraid.

1085
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,300
He got scared.

1086
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,980
He's never been there before.

1087
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,820
Mark, thank you for the super chat.

1088
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:27,840
Thank you, thank you.

1089
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,840
A long neck means it takes longer for...

1090
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,100
He went back!

1091
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,760
Why did you go back?

1092
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,200
No, it's fucked up.

1093
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:42,220
The second hole is actually technically bigger than the first one too.

1094
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,320
Why...

1095
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,820
Why does...

1096
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,280
Why does he run?

1097
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,380
He was too scared of the new hole.

1098
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,320
It's over.

1099
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,020
Put him out of his misery.

1100
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,000
Brother, why are you like this?

1101
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,200
He like touched it a little bit.

1102
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,380
And then he got scared.

1103
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,820
And he's like, never again.

1104
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:09,660
Mom...

1105
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,700
Mom, please...

1106
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,020
Take me back home.

1107
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,340
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

1108
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:19,720
Thank you.

1109
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,380
Thank you.

1110
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,880
Self delete, please.

1111
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:28,880
If he couldn't win when he was literally right next to it, he's a lost cause.

1112
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,380
Thank you for the super chat.

1113
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:31,780
Thank you.

1114
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:32,640
Thank you.

1115
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:33,960
Okay, that's...

1116
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,220
To be fair, that is true.

1117
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:35,940
He was...

1118
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:40,120
We knew he was special when we put the trophy right next to him.

1119
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,760
And then he went the opposite direction.

1120
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:43,840
I...

1121
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,840
Two...

1122
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,340
One...

1123
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,120
Zero...

1124
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,220
Bye long goon.

1125
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,240
You shall be deleted...

1126
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,960
Out of existence now.

1127
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,940
Your brethren shall...

1128
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,460
Shall win the race for you.

1129
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:00,320
They shall...

1130
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,940
Tomato goon shall...

1131
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,560
Shall be there in your place.

1132
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,420
Alright, let's get...

1133
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,840
Reset the level and make a...

1134
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,020
Alright.

1135
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,740
The final two tests, guys.

1136
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,680
I believe in you.

1137
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,420
Alright, let's make a new track for us.

1138
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,180
Okay.

1139
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,240
You know what?

1140
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,620
We'll send like...

1141
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,360
Some people on this side.

1142
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,360
And then some people on the other side.

1143
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,200
Okay, here we go.

1144
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:28,740
Alright.

1145
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,560
And then...

1146
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,020
We'll do something like...

1147
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,460
There we go.

1148
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:38,820
Ooh.

1149
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:41,920
Alright.

1150
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,040
And then we'll put the trophy...

1151
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,020
Right here.

1152
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,580
We'll put another race...

1153
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,580
We are not doing ten more minutes of that.

1154
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:58,580
The coolest.

1155
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,640
You guys like my coolest.

1156
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,300
And then we'll put...

1157
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,440
Punchers right...

1158
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:02,680
Oh wait.

1159
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,620
We'll put the punchers...

1160
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,820
Right here.

1161
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,400
And then...

1162
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,540
Here.

1163
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,760
And then...

1164
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,680
Here too.

1165
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,060
And then we'll put some mines.

1166
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:21,800
Alright.

1167
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,160
And then we'll put some oils...

1168
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,320
Oil here.

1169
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,160
Too.

1170
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,480
And then...

1171
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,640
The oil pit.

1172
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,660
It's like the mud pit.

1173
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,220
But...

1174
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:30,920
But hotter.

1175
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:36,660
Yeah.

1176
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:36,740
Yeah.

1177
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:37,940
Get out of the oil.

1178
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:39,420
Alright.

1179
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,120
Let's see.

1180
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,000
Hey.

1181
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,420
There we go.

1182
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:43,940
Okay.

1183
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:44,140
Wait.

1184
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,160
Three should be here.

1185
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,480
Actually, we'll put two over here.

1186
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,000
Alright.

1187
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,280
So my four dragoons.

1188
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,540
There's always been four.

1189
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,500
Four.

1190
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:52,820
Um...

1191
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:53,740
Drag...

1192
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:54,200
Regular goon.

1193
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,160
Chonky goon.

1194
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,180
Tomato goon.

1195
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,500
And egg goon.

1196
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,900
There's always been four dragoons.

1197
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,820
And those were our four goons.

1198
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:02,480
Alright.

1199
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,920
Place your bets, guys.

1200
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,900
Who will be your representative?

1201
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,020
To fight.

1202
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,560
To race against Jovio Dokiman.

1203
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,100
Place your bets.

1204
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,200
Chonky goon.

1205
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:25,820
Or...

1206
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:27,920
Tomato...

1207
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,460
Goon.

1208
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:30,480
Alright.

1209
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,640
Place your bets, guys.

1210
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,560
Place your bets.

1211
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,480
Chonky goon currently has the highest win rate out of all the goons.

1212
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,860
But will he be able?

1213
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:42,080
No.

1214
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:49,800
Will he be able to win this race again and get a rematch against Jovio Dokiman.

1215
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,220
Alright.

1216
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:51,940
In three.

1217
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:52,960
Two.

1218
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:53,820
One.

1219
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,120
Alright.

1220
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,140
They're all like slipping in the oil pit.

1221
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:08,830
First they have to get out of the sexy hot oil pit though.

1222
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,750
Oh my god.

1223
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:12,430
They all slipped up.

1224
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:14,130
Damon.

1225
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:15,770
Thank you for the super chat.

1226
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:16,310
Thank you.

1227
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,070
Thank you.

1228
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:17,690
No.

1229
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:18,470
No.

1230
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,270
They can't get it.

1231
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:20,970
They can't make it out of it.

1232
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:21,450
I believe.

1233
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:23,910
Stop saying that.

1234
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,040
To be fair.

1235
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,080
Tomato is closer to...

1236
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,020
Oh.

1237
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,460
The tomato goons out.

1238
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,360
That's my goon.

1239
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,500
I have custody of him on the weekends.

1240
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,740
I know that guy.

1241
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,190
Oh wait.

1242
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:47,350
No.

1243
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:47,510
No.

1244
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:48,030
Don't go back.

1245
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:48,930
Don't go back.

1246
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:49,350
Come on.

1247
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:50,210
Come on.

1248
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,770
Come on, tomato goon.

1249
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:52,810
Come on.

1250
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,270
Cause if you win technically, I win.

1251
01:05:58,650 --> 01:05:59,090
Look.

1252
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,230
Tomato goons are bleeding.

1253
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:01,290
It's just the juices.

1254
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:02,250
Of the sweat.

1255
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,510
He's just sweating red.

1256
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:08,070
Only plays on the weekend.

1257
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:09,370
Oh my.

1258
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,770
Come on.

1259
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:10,690
You're so close.

1260
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,890
You're so close to the fish like tomato.

1261
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,790
He's beating up the dragon.

1262
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:19,090
Oh my god.

1263
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:19,810
Oh.

1264
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,730
Egg goons fucking sabotage chonky goons.

1265
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:23,630
No.

1266
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:24,930
Not back in the oil.

1267
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:25,490
Come on.

1268
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:28,130
Get out of there.

1269
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:30,750
Come on.

1270
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:32,730
Come on.

1271
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:33,450
You can do this.

1272
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:34,730
Get out of there.

1273
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:35,930
Come on.

1274
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:38,830
Get out of the oil pit.

1275
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:40,970
Get out of there.

1276
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:41,430
OKAY.

1277
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:41,870
It's OKAY.

1278
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:44,370
The egg goon isn't in the corridor yet.

1279
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:45,950
We're still fine.

1280
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:47,870
Yes.

1281
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:48,450
Chonky.

1282
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:50,370
Slow and Steady.

1283
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,550
How the fuck did the chonky goon make it to the other side.

1284
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:56,530
Your fucking brother is on the left side still.

1285
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:02,570
You know what they say.

1286
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:14,110
The smaller they are, the more aerodynamic they are... Yeah, Iggoon, yeah... Dragoon just... Just noclip!

1287
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,790
Just face through the wall!

1288
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:27,230
I like how... Tomato Goon has been like... Still trapped in the oil pit.

1289
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:34,210
He's just like... He's just like... I just wanna be slippery and shiny.

1290
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,270
Yeah, it doesn't matter, they're fast.

1291
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:44,250
It doesn't matter if they're... Oh my god, he's back in the fucking oil pit.

1292
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:48,690
They're just faster to hit the walls, chat.

1293
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,570
The oil pit is just too sexy.

1294
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:59,370
He just wanna be a fucking... He just wanna be a fucking salad.

1295
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:06,550
He's not looking too good for Chonky Goon, guys.

1296
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,970
Chonky Goon... His whole mission is just to get rid of the bombs.

1297
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:23,350
Chonky Goon... He just... That's his whole mission.

1298
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:29,590
On the wall, Chonky Goon!

1299
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:34,830
Chonky Goon is to be... Deserved to be sent to the power of...

1300
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:36,130
Roar, Iggoon!

1301
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:36,710
Let's go!

1302
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,300
All right.

1303
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:41,960
All right.

1304
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,540
Agoon!

1305
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,400
Chonky Goon!

1306
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,330
Now race against...

1307
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:45,570
...Doki...

1308
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,220
...Against...

1309
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,920
Jovio Dokiment!

1310
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,360
A rematch of the century!

1311
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:52,680
All right!

1312
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,460
Let us...

1313
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,220
Grab...

1314
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,420
All right, let me grab...

1315
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,180
...one of my favorite maps.

1316
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,960
Give me a sec, guys.

1317
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,680
I'm gonna grab one of my favorite maps.

1318
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,860
That I like to use.

1319
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,940
I think it's...

1320
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,300
I think it's...

1321
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,860
I think it was this one?

1322
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,020
This one?

1323
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:13,940
No.

1324
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,220
Okay, it's not this one.

1325
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:15,960
Oh, this one.

1326
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:16,200
Yeah.

1327
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:17,140
All right.

1328
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,380
Okay.

1329
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:18,400
Heh.

1330
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,600
Here we go.

1331
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:22,300
Put...

1332
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:23,880
...this here.

1333
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,420
Okay, let's get rid of seven.

1334
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,720
And then we'll put two here.

1335
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:31,740
All right.

1336
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,340
A rematch.

1337
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,340
Let me make the pull.

1338
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,840
We're back here.

1339
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,280
Where it all began.

1340
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,460
Place...

1341
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,320
...your...

1342
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,140
...bets.

1343
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,600
Jovio Dokiment...

1344
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,820
...versus...

1345
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:48,920
...Egg...

1346
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:49,840
...Goon.

1347
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,620
All right.

1348
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,260
If Eggoon wins this...

1349
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,600
...you get your announcement, chat.

1350
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,260
In three...

1351
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:03,860
...two...

1352
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,120
...one.

1353
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,220
Eggoon does have size though.

1354
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,540
What happens if he loses?

1355
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,800
Then we must have a rematch with all the dragoons again.

1356
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,160
Until...

1357
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:24,700
What?

1358
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,320
Jovio's like, hey loser.

1359
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,640
He's like, yeah.

1360
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,460
Can't even get out of the hole.

1361
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:33,200
Oh shit.

1362
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:33,680
Never mind.

1363
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,900
He taught the Eggoon how to get out of the hole.

1364
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,460
He felt bad for him.

1365
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,160
Jovio's taunting him.

1366
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:44,640
He taunted him, but Eggoon felt so inspired.

1367
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,200
He was like, that's it.

1368
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:50,260
I won't let you win.

1369
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,920
For the dragoons!

1370
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1371
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,060
Thank you.

1372
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:57,760
Thank you.

1373
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,960
He's winning by pure spite!

1374
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,000
Oh no.

1375
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,600
Jovio, Doki, please.

1376
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,100
Doki, please.

1377
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:07,340
Doki, please.

1378
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:07,720
Doki, please.

1379
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:07,780
Doki, man.

1380
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,080
Get out of the hole!

1381
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,260
You've taunted him enough!

1382
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:17,580
If he loses, he's gonna be scrambled good.

1383
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:18,340
Sorry.

1384
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1385
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:20,500
Thank you.

1386
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:21,240
Thank you.

1387
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,520
Avenge your brothers!

1388
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,540
For the Longoon that's trapped in hell!

1389
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:35,320
He can't even see it and he's made more progress than Longoon did in 10 minutes.

1390
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,440
Please!

1391
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,900
For your brother that's stuck in hell!

1392
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,040
No!

1393
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,090
Come on, Doki, man.

1394
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:46,770
Come on, Doki.

1395
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,830
You got this!

1396
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,210
Doki Field was able to beat this map!

1397
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,950
With his eyes closed!

1398
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:57,210
No, please stop showing your ass!

1399
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,390
I know it's cheeky!

1400
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,250
I know you're kicked up!

1401
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:01,410
We all do!

1402
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:04,230
Each Doki has kicked up asses!

1403
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:09,990
We all do!

1404
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:13,110
There's no Doki that doesn't have the cake!

1405
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:20,110
Of course...

1406
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:21,210
Of course Kroki does!

1407
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:23,170
The tail feather is just hiding the cake!

1408
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:28,560
Oh my god!

1409
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:29,540
Get down from there!

1410
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:30,020
Come on!

1411
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,060
Just need to get down!

1412
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:33,220
Come on, Doki-ville!

1413
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,440
Come on!

1414
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,840
Come on, Doki-man!

1415
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:36,760
Come on!

1416
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,940
Enough with his hole!

1417
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,820
I know you like the egg goon's hole, but enough!

1418
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:42,480
Bro!

1419
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,100
You're scaring me!

1420
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,460
He's good pushing Jovial in the box!

1421
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,020
No!

1422
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,500
Stop gapping him!

1423
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:53,700
Stop!

1424
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,760
Stop gapping!

1425
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:07,770
They really like that top of the map!

1426
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:11,310
Bro, he's like playing fucking goalkeeper right now!

1427
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:12,430
Oh, it's okay!

1428
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:13,570
No, Jovial, please!

1429
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:14,770
Jovial, downstairs!

1430
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:15,630
Downstairs!

1431
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:18,950
That's for tossing it!

1432
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:21,050
Come on!

1433
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:24,950
You're just flexing!

1434
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:26,930
Come on, come on!

1435
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:27,270
No!

1436
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,870
Come on!

1437
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:28,610
It's right there!

1438
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:29,750
It's right there, Jovial!

1439
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,770
It's right there!

1440
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:31,450
Come on!

1441
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:32,850
Look!

1442
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:35,130
And Goon came back just to say hi!

1443
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:36,210
It's your chance!

1444
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:36,930
It's your time!

1445
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,710
Toasting you for the super chat!

1446
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:40,710
Thank you, thank you!

1447
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:44,470
That reflects the streamer we're kicked up to!

1448
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:47,250
Oh, that's good!

1449
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:47,630
That's good!

1450
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:48,530
He's distracted!

1451
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:54,070
He's like the turtle in the hair!

1452
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,290
He's taking a nap right now!

1453
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:57,550
Fighting his time!

1454
01:13:58,750 --> 01:13:59,410
Come on, Jovial!

1455
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,530
I know you got this!

1456
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,550
For the Doki Council!

1457
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:03,610
For the Doki-verse!

1458
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:06,410
Every Doki in the Doki-verse is a winner!

1459
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:06,810
Come on!

1460
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:07,510
Yes, Jovial!

1461
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:07,910
Yes!

1462
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:09,970
Don't disappoint me!

1463
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:12,610
Yes!

1464
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:13,730
Yes!

1465
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,030
He's building up speed!

1466
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:19,350
No!

1467
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:19,750
No!

1468
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:20,390
Go back down!

1469
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:20,970
No!

1470
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:21,450
Yes!

1471
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,390
No!

1472
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:24,870
Oh

1473
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:34,930
my god!

1474
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:36,170
He's just following him!

1475
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:39,970
Escape the hole!

1476
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:41,890
Oh, we're so close!

1477
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:43,850
Right there!

1478
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:45,570
In there!

1479
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,850
They're just pretending to race!

1480
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:51,070
So they can have fun in the hole!

1481
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,930
It's like a little intermission for them!

1482
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:56,330
Okay, that's good!

1483
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,190
Aguna's trapped on the left side!

1484
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,670
He hasn't know how to enter the third hole yet!

1485
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,610
Because some people don't know there's a third hole!

1486
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:07,810
Oh, yes!

1487
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:09,430
Take over his hole!

1488
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:11,870
That's good, that's good!

1489
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:12,310
Block him!

1490
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:12,830
Block him!

1491
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,050
Now just head down!

1492
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,210
Head down, Jovial!

1493
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:15,630
Yes!

1494
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:16,750
Down is up!

1495
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:17,410
Yes!

1496
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:18,150
Down is up!

1497
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,340
And then you go up!

1498
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,660
And then you go up, Jovial!

1499
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,000
And then you go up!

1500
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:28,260
Please!

1501
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,180
Then you go!

1502
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:29,680
Yes!

1503
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,300
Yes!

1504
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:37,470
Come on, dragoons!

1505
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,030
How can you guys not win that?

1506
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,450
Down is up!

1507
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:42,050
No!

1508
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:43,690
It's okay!

1509
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,310
I believe in you guys!

1510
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:47,950
I guess I just gotta give you guys another map!

1511
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:49,190
Alright!

1512
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:50,130
How about...

1513
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:52,750
I'll give you an easy map, guys!

1514
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:53,350
Look!

1515
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:55,610
I'll give you guys such...

1516
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:56,190
You know what?

1517
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,730
No!

1518
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,390
Alright!

1519
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:57,870
Oh!

1520
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:58,830
Oh!

1521
01:15:58,830 --> 01:15:59,170
Come on!

1522
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:02,870
Look at how easy this map is!

1523
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:03,270
There's...

1524
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,150
Come on, guys!

1525
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:06,550
You guys just need to train one more time!

1526
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:08,430
And then it should be okay!

1527
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:12,610
You guys just need to train one more time!

1528
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:13,810
And then you'll be fine!

1529
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:14,390
Oh my god!

1530
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:17,730
Look at all these losers here that bet on the wrong Doki!

1531
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:24,050
Look at that!

1532
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:27,050
See, the trophy is literally right here!

1533
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,970
There's no way to fuck it up, guys!

1534
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:31,130
There's...

1535
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:35,570
Look at that!

1536
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:38,610
It's literally right there!

1537
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,330
There's no way you guys can fuck it up!

1538
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,230
This should be...

1539
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:42,930
Oh my god!

1540
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:44,490
Ikkun was like...

1541
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:44,730
Look at!

1542
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:45,710
What the fuck!

1543
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:46,970
Oh my god!

1544
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,070
Ikkun was like...

1545
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,750
I want a rematch!

1546
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:50,710
I...

1547
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:53,990
He locked it!

1548
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:57,130
He wanted...

1549
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:57,670
He's like...

1550
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:58,730
I heard no bell!

1551
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:02,550
Alright!

1552
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,870
We'll do an easier map!

1553
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:07,390
Just cause I'm a little worried...

1554
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:07,870
Wait...

1555
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:08,850
I'm a little...

1556
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:10,070
I'm a little...

1557
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:11,310
Worried...

1558
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:12,110
For a goon!

1559
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:13,170
Ha ha ha ha!

1560
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:14,650
Let's see it!

1561
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,370
We'll do...

1562
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:18,710
Okay, no, not this one!

1563
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:20,490
This one's called Purgatory!

1564
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:22,970
This might be a little difficult for you!

1565
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:24,470
Ha ha ha ha!

1566
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,670
Ha ha ha ha!

1567
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:26,390
Ha ha ha ha!

1568
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:27,830
Hmm...

1569
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:29,450
There's one good one...

1570
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:30,330
Oh...

1571
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:31,350
Oh this one!

1572
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:31,730
Alright!

1573
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,190
We'll swap it!

1574
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,390
Alright!

1575
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:35,430
Alright!

1576
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:37,330
The chonky goon is here to watch too!

1577
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:37,710
Heh!

1578
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:38,530
Alright!

1579
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:40,710
Place your bets everyone!

1580
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:42,490
Start pull!

1581
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:43,470
Place...

1582
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:44,170
Your...

1583
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:45,370
Bets...

1584
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:46,070
Ig...

1585
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:47,150
Goon...

1586
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:48,290
Or...

1587
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,130
Yeah!

1588
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:49,830
That's where...

1589
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:50,670
Long goon is!

1590
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:51,810
We're not going to Purgatory!

1591
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:52,670
Ha ha ha!

1592
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:54,250
That's where the losers are!

1593
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:56,230
Versus...

1594
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:57,590
Jovio...

1595
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,670
Doki-Mint!

1596
01:17:59,010 --> 01:17:59,810
Ha ha ha!

1597
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:02,730
Alright!

1598
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:05,830
Revenge!

1599
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:07,750
The rematch of the century!

1600
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:10,770
Here we go!

1601
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,060
Ha ha ha!

1602
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:17,940
Oh my god!

1603
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:18,940
Jovio ready!

1604
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,260
It fucking bumped into the egg goon!

1605
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,720
Like it's hockey!

1606
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,340
An egg we trust!

1607
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:29,980
Look!

1608
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,140
We even have your brothers here to watch!

1609
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,860
They're like, If you lose this we'll fucking eat you!

1610
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:36,860
Ha ha ha!

1611
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:37,960
Ha ha ha!

1612
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:38,420
Ha ha ha!

1613
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,740
Jovio ready being aggressive!

1614
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,300
And shank the egg on the drive-by!

1615
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,740
The chonk...

1616
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,240
The extra chonky goons gotta watch!

1617
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:48,760
He's...

1618
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,000
They're...

1619
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,480
They're giving extra pressure to egg goon!

1620
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,580
They're like, If you fuck this up for us brother...

1621
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,760
You shall be consumed!

1622
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,080
We're so hungry!

1623
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,800
Ha ha ha ha!

1624
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:01,900
Ha ha ha!

1625
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,220
Ha ha ha!

1626
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,880
We're so hungry!

1627
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:06,640
Ha ha ha ha!

1628
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,650
Ha ha ha ha!

1629
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:11,630
Ha ha ha!

1630
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:13,490
Come on Jovio!

1631
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:14,670
I know you wanna...

1632
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:17,910
You wanna like, give egg goon a false sense of security!

1633
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:19,990
But I know you also wanna win!

1634
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:20,810
Don't you?

1635
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,650
You come from a line of winners!

1636
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:22,870
Yes!

1637
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:25,390
She took his lunch money.

1638
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:27,510
But the egg will take the win!

1639
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:29,550
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1640
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:29,810
Thank you.

1641
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:30,210
Thank you.

1642
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:34,050
Oh, both Jovial and Egg Goon are on the bottom left.

1643
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:34,670
Never mind.

1644
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:36,370
Jovial was like, I don't like that.

1645
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:37,510
Whoa!

1646
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:38,930
Egg Goon!

1647
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:39,730
Yeah!

1648
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:40,810
No!

1649
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:51,430
So that's right up here.

1650
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:52,070
You know what?

1651
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,110
No, it makes sense.

1652
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:54,030
It makes sense.

1653
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:55,250
Literally, he was surrounded.

1654
01:19:55,250 --> 01:20:00,790
He was surrounded by all the other Dragoons there.

1655
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:02,150
He just didn't want to get eaten.

1656
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,810
You know, that makes sense.

1657
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:13,890
I did say, I did promise you guys, that the moment you Dragoons finally pass the test, you get your announcement.

1658
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:23,770
Before I give you guys the announcement, I just want to say that you can also play the game yourself.

1659
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,730
So here is the pin link.

1660
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:27,630
The pin comment.

1661
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:30,730
Sorry, my brain isn't English-ing right now.

1662
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:45,270
But, if you want to play and try out the mod yourself, feel free to download the game on the itch.io page.

1663
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:52,750
And you can also mess around, create your own maps, do your own embedding system, seeing what Dragoon would win.

1664
01:20:54,630 --> 01:21:06,130
Huge shout-out again to the team for doing this in such a short time span and being able to do, like, this mini game jam with me.

1665
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:11,090
And, you know, creating something really fun for all of you guys.

1666
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:19,210
I had a great time watching the progress of everything being made and seeing it all come together.

1667
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:20,830
So, huge shout-out to the team again.

1668
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:28,630
If you guys want to check their socials, you can see it on the itch.io page where it links to all the creators that helped me with making this.

1669
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:41,450
Anyway, but Iggoon, to all the Iggoons out there, congratulations on winning, on being the chosen Dragoon representative.

1670
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:45,050
To beat Jovio Dohima.

1671
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:50,330
You are the peak Dragoon form.

1672
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:55,190
Now, on to the announcement as your prize.

1673
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:34,290
Yeah!

1674
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:36,390
It's a new outfit!

1675
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:37,490
Yes!

1676
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:46,250
Finally, a new outfit reveal for... Sorry, my brain is not working.

1677
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:51,610
I'm such like an amateur right now.

1678
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:52,830
I'm so tired.

1679
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:58,750
But yes, we're finally gonna have our own beach episode!

1680
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:09,250
Next week, starting next week on June 20th, 5pm PSC, we will have our own beach episode!

1681
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:09,870
Yes!

1682
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:11,830
My very first outfit reveal!

1683
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:12,490
Yay!

1684
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:15,610
Since coming back as the Bounty Honor!

1685
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:17,990
I'm really looking forward.

1686
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:20,190
I'm really looking forward to it.

1687
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:25,430
I have some fucking crazy ideas for that stream.

1688
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:26,170
Well, not crazy.

1689
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:27,290
I don't want to hype it up.

1690
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:32,310
It's just nice to be creative again.

1691
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:34,170
So, I'm super excited.

1692
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:36,190
Luka, thank you for the Akasupa!

1693
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:36,610
Thank you!

1694
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:37,310
Thank you!

1695
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:38,630
I really appreciate it!

1696
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:39,730
Beach ball suit!

1697
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:40,510
Let's go!

1698
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:42,010
Next week, they give a super chat.

1699
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:42,270
Thank you!

1700
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:42,810
Thank you!

1701
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:45,150
So excited for the summer outfit reveal.

1702
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:45,850
See ya!

1703
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:46,590
They give a super chat.

1704
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:46,830
Thank you!

1705
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:47,250
Thank you!

1706
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:50,410
If Doki is a beach bird, does that mean she's a seagull now?

1707
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:51,290
They give a super chat.

1708
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,570
Thank you!

1709
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:52,090
Thank you!

1710
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:52,670
Alright!

1711
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:56,410
So, a little context about this outfit.

1712
01:23:56,690 --> 01:24:01,330
This outfit is actually one of the charity goal outfits.

1713
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:11,270
So, the winner of the auction that got to pick the theme of this outfit decided to pick summer outfit.

1714
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:18,690
So, this is... your fellow dragoon actually helped design this particular outfit as well.

1715
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:20,950
So, I hope you guys look forward to it.

1716
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:24,830
And it is a summer theme slash beach episode.

1717
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:28,810
I will post the silhouette of it later today.

1718
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:33,890
As well as the dragoon race test where people want to download it on Twitter.

1719
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:35,130
But yeah!

1720
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:36,510
I look forward to it, guys.

1721
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:40,870
It's gonna be really... it's gonna be fun to have something new.

1722
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:42,290
A new skin suit.

1723
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,350
And... it's gonna be fun to have a new skin suit.

1724
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:48,910
And just to show you guys new hairstyle and everything.

1725
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,530
It's gonna be fun in general.

1726
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:52,890
But thank you guys for coming, everyone!

1727
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:56,330
I did... I didn't know what to do for like...

1728
01:24:56,330 --> 01:25:00,410
But like... okay, I like struggled a little bit trying to think of how to do with this type of announcements.

1729
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:03,410
Cause I, you know, I miss doing creative stuff for you guys.

1730
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:06,350
It's been a very long time since...

1731
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:09,150
Since I've done creative stuff these days.

1732
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:11,030
Since I've been like super busy.

1733
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:14,870
And, you know, just playing... just streaming games and stuff.

1734
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:16,970
Because of how busy I was.

1735
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:20,010
And there's so much stuff behind the scenes and everything.

1736
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:21,670
So...

1737
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:25,370
And then sometimes I get like ideas and inspirations.

1738
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,050
So fucking last minute.

1739
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:30,270
So I really appreciate the team for enabling me.

1740
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:34,190
And for like putting up with like, you know, such a tight deadline.

1741
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:36,110
To put all of this together.

1742
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:37,410
As the announcement.

1743
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:40,370
And it was...

1744
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:42,490
I really appreciate them as well.

1745
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:45,330
For creating all of this together with me.

1746
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:47,110
So huge shout out for the team.

1747
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:49,310
And it's been fun doing something creative like this again.

1748
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:52,090
I always enjoy doing stuff like this.

1749
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:54,550
And, you know, being able to just like...

1750
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:56,490
Do more than just streaming video games.

1751
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,090
Technically, this is a game as well.

1752
01:25:59,290 --> 01:25:59,630
But...

1753
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:01,890
But...

1754
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:02,510
But...

1755
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:02,690
But...

1756
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:03,270
We...

1757
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:03,630
We...

1758
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:06,830
I helped produce a game for you guys.

1759
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:09,250
For you guys to mess around with.

1760
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:10,230
Like a mod of the game.

1761
01:26:10,350 --> 01:26:10,470
Sorry.

1762
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,250
We didn't make it.

1763
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:13,050
We modded another game.

1764
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:13,890
To make it more...

1765
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:15,530
Doki slash dragon themed.

1766
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:16,870
Um...

1767
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:17,230
But...

1768
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:18,510
It was still really fun to do.

1769
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:20,510
And it was really fun to like...

1770
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,870
Just see the progress from the beginning to now.

1771
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:23,790
And everything.

1772
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:24,550
And...

1773
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,890
It was just great to do something super creative again.

1774
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:27,650
Um...

1775
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:29,170
And I hope I get to do more creative stuff.

1776
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,090
In the future.

1777
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:30,950
Um...

1778
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:32,590
As things get...

1779
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:33,430
Um...

1780
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,090
What's the word?

1781
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:35,050
As...

1782
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:36,370
It gets easier to manage.

1783
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:37,830
My time.

1784
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:40,170
I've been delegating a lot more this time.

1785
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:40,950
So...

1786
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:42,610
It's slowly freeing up my time.

1787
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:43,230
To...

1788
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:44,270
To...

1789
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:44,510
Uh...

1790
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:46,070
Use my brain for things like this.

1791
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:46,690
So...

1792
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:48,070
I'm glad I was able to.

1793
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,910
Uh...

1794
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:49,210
But yes.

1795
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:50,330
Thank you everybody for coming.

1796
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:51,990
Thank you all for the super chats.

1797
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:52,750
Uh...

1798
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,150
I'm gonna go rest now.

1799
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:54,890
And sleep.

1800
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:55,810
Cause I'm tired.

1801
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:57,150
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1802
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:58,610
I'm eepy.

1803
01:26:59,230 --> 01:26:59,710
Ha ha ha ha.

1804
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:00,730
But...

1805
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:02,450
I hope you guys enjoyed...

1806
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,630
This little fun stream I did today.

1807
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:07,250
And I'm very excited about the announcement.

1808
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:08,390
Um...

1809
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:09,250
So I'll see you guys...

1810
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:11,030
Um...

1811
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,370
Well...

1812
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:11,970
I'll see you guys...

1813
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:13,090
Like on Monday.

1814
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:13,790
But...

1815
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:14,630
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1816
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:17,070
But I do hope...

1817
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:18,750
To see you guys on...

1818
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:19,330
Friday.

1819
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:20,710
For the outfit reveal.

1820
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:22,150
On June 20th.

1821
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,050
5pm PST.

1822
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:24,850
I'll play the trailer again for all of you guys.

1823
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:26,050
But thank you all for coming.

1824
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:27,630
As always everybody.

1825
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:28,360
Stay hydrated.

1826
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:29,590
Posture check.

1827
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:30,610
Get up and move around.

1828
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,650
To get that blood flowing.

1829
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:32,670
And if you suffer me.

1830
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:33,490
Head to bed.

1831
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:34,010
Cause...

1832
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:34,910
You deserve it.

1833
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:36,230
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

1834
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:37,990
You can tell my brain is lagging a lot.

1835
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:39,570
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1836
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,030
I'm just...

1837
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:41,470
I'm just...

1838
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:42,410
I'm just a little teepy.

1839
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:43,690
Just a little tired.

1840
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:44,790
Ha ha ha.

1841
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:47,270
I'm trying not to drink caffeine today.

1842
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:48,450
Uh...

1843
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:48,690
Ha ha ha.

1844
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:50,470
Because I know like caffeine...

1845
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:51,730
I don't wanna depend on caffeine.

1846
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:53,190
So like...

1847
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:53,390
So like...

1848
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:54,830
So my brain is lagging a little bit.

1849
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:56,270
Because of the lack of caffeine.

1850
01:27:56,590 --> 01:27:58,010
But I'm trying my best to like...

1851
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,150
Not rely on it.

1852
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,210
Ha ha ha ha.

1853
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:01,950
Ha ha ha.

1854
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:02,790
But...

1855
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:03,890
Thank you all for coming.

1856
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:05,110

1857
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:06,090
Bye guys.

1858
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:06,850
Bye.

1859
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:07,030
Bye.

1860
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:07,210
Bye.

1861
